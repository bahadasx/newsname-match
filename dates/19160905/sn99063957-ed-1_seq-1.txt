' (I'nitei Press stuff correspondent.)
Washington, Went. 5 With allied dip
lomats in Washington protesting
iiiii8t retaliatory legislation already
t'liucted by congress to offset the British
blacklist, the senate today atruck two
more blows. Amendments adopted to
the revenue bill are likely, some of
ficials believe, to result in official ob
jections taking the place of the private,
though positive protests against retalia
tion which certain diplomats here have
voiced.
The first act today was passage of
senator Thomas' amendment to the
revenue bill empowering the president
to retaliate against any belligtrent com
merce ship that discriminates against
American shippers and exporters.
The second was adoption of (Senator
Ph elan's amendment to the same meas
ure refusing rights of the United States
mails or the facilities of any interstate
express company or of any wireless,
telegraph or cable company to the citi
zens of belligerent countries which dis
criminate against Americans.
Both amendments explicitly empower
the president to take these steps " when
. ever during existence of a war in which
the Vnited States is not engaged, the
president shall be satisfied there is rea
sonable ground to believe" belligerent
governments have denied all lawful
rights to all American citizens.
Violations of both proposed laws are
punishable by fines of $i0,000 or two
years' imprisonment or both. Both ad
mittedly are retaliatory measures
ogninst Great Britain's blacklist and
seizure and detention of mails.
Thomas' amendment was drawn with
the approval of the state department
and the president is empowered by its
terms to use "any part of the land and
naval forces he deems necessary" to up
bold it.
Wheat Jumps Again
In Chicago Market
' Chicago, Sept. 5. Bull raids shot
(September wheat up five cents over
Saturday's close in the Chicago grain
market today. Light offerings and
strong cables accentuated the upward
movement. September at $1.50 was up

ber gained 1 3-4 at 1.5t 3-4 while May
advanced 1 1-2 to $1.52 1-2.
Corn opened firmer, assisted bv the
advance in wheat. Further gains were
made later on good buying movement
and reports of a corn scarcity. Sep
tember at 87 was quarter above the
opening. December gnined half at 74 1-4
and May was up 3-8 at 77 3-8.
Oats was strong at the opening but

at the advanced prices. September was
down quarter at 4i 5-S; December un
changed at 49 and Mav unchanged at

A. B. Garretson, Leader of
Brotherhoods' Fight, Sees
i 'p This As Final Outcome
tEDICTS BIG CHANGE
OTHIN NEXT TEN YEARS
I First of Series of Events
Leading to Government
Ownership
By Carl D. Groat
(I'nited I'ress staff correspondent)
Washington, Sept. 5. Government
ownership of railroads mid Cither pub
lic utilities is coming, in the opinion
of A. B. Garretson. leader of the big
four railroad brotherhoods fight for an
eight hour day. Avoidance of a nation
al rail strike, throng strong governmen
tal interference, he believes, is only one
oi a series of steps toward such an end.
"Ten years hence," he predicted,
"you will see a mighty stride toward
government ownership and operation of
all railroads as well as other public and
quasi-public utilities. I believe in such
a program after mature reflection. I
take this view that there are deadly
dnngers in goernnient ownership but
with the government engaged in reg
ulation as it must I feel that we
must choose the least dangerous. That
is government operation and ownership.
The sentiment in that direction has
grown steadily "as a bricklayer would
say; settlement of the strike is just
another course in the structure."
Garretson explained that some roads
may face a balance on the wrong side
of their books, as a result of govern
ment regulation.
"Then," he continued, "such lines
must look to the government for reim
bursement. But the lines making a
profit should not be allowed to escape
while their weaker associates are put
under government control and assist
ance. Hence as I see it, government
operation and control of all railroads
must result.
Commenting on the Garetson inter
view, one of the foremost experts of
the country said today:
"His statement that this is one
course in the structure is mild, It ap
pears to me that this law has about
built the whole structure for govern
ment ownership. It certainly has
brought such a situation ten years near
er to realization."

Dwight P. Dilworth, well to do lawyer
of Montclnir, N. J., was killed in lov
ers lane" in Vnn Cortland Park here
Sunday night by would-be blackmailers,
the police today are searching for two
men who shot him to death.
Miss Mary McNiff, who with
Dilworth when the two men suddenly
appeared from the brush 'anil ordered
him to throw up liis hands, was permit
ted to go to Long Beach today. Mis Mc
Niff had been eliminated insofar as
learning through her who was respon
sible for the murder is concerned. The
plan to have her re-enact the incident
connected with the killing of her com
panion on' the spot where Dilworth was
shot, was abandoned today. Miss Mc
Niff told the police she would return to
New York to lend such Bid as she could j
at any time but the police have lit" i
hope of her meager description of the'
highwaymen aiding them to any great
extent.
The police base their conclusion that
Dilworth was killed by blackmailers on.

of the shooting given by Miss McNiff
and numerous complaints that have
come in revealing that the nark has
apparently been infested with black
mailers of the type that attacked Dil

tions from Mrs. Dilworth the body of
Dilworth was today turned over to the
Masons of Montclair, N. J. Prepara
tions were made there for a Masonic fu

"lovers lane" in Van Cortland Park.
The audience will consist of police of
ficers and detectives anxious to learn
the full details of tho crime.
Baffled by the fact that Dilworth
was not robbed, the police today believe

ALL SALEM WAS THERE
TO SEE "WHEN JOHNNY
CAME MARCHING HOME"
"Hello, George; Hello Bill there he
is my dear old boy," and even more
tender greetings were heard at the
Southern Pacific depot this morning as
members of Company M jumped from
the train looking around eagerly fori
friends and relatives.
It was a bronzed and hardened lot of
healthy looking soldiers that greeted
their friends and relatives when the
long delayed H. P. special pulled into
the depot at 9:30 this morning. There
was none of the pallor of the office
man nor of the student on the faces of
thnt bunch of soldier boys. Instead, it
Was about the healthiest looking lot of
young men that ever got together in
Siilem. Those who were thin and care
worn are now full faced and full of
vigor.
In fact, every member of the com
pany, with but one exception, has in
creused in weight from five to 15
pounds and the general appearance of
tho boys was highly satisfactory to relo
tives as well as civilians.
After the first greetings, coming
down the station platform as conquering
heroes, attention was given to the 150 ;
packages of good things to eat that j
were stacked high on a truck in the
baggugo room and it is needless to ay
that the boys will be eating home cook
ies and delicacies for several days. '
Many of the packages were addressed '
to the corporal and his squad. J

Camp Withycombe, Or., Sept. fi.
Bronzed and hurd ns regulars, two bat

Officers said the Third battalion would
be due tonight.

Clcnard McLougiilin with lis staff nc-
confpamed the troops. Tents were;
pitched at the cam, sentries posted J
and the routine or army lire rnpimy
resumeil after the trip. Many were
detailed to unload equipment. Visit
ors, it was stated, will not be welcome
until the infantrymen hnve a chance to
get "settled."
All nlong thi homeward route, men
said, they were given hearty recep
tions. The same steam engine has been
pumping water out of an Kuglish coal
mine more than a century.

The Salem Patriotic - league was on
duty taking care of the packages and
arranging them. Also the Cherrians un
der command of Captain Dick and the
Salem Hifle club in charge of Captain
Rosenberg, who with Chief Welch and
his deputies, aided in keeping the crowd
back while the near relatives had first
chance at the returning ones.
In referring to the general condition
of the boys Captain Oehlhar said: "We
are bringing the boys back absolutely
in perfect health, many of them having
gained in weight from 10 to 15 pounds.
There never was a lot of healthier sol
diers or men in better spirits. We are
grateful to the good meu and women
of Hnlem for their various remembrnnces
and the interest they have taken in our
welfnre. There is no telling how long
we will be nt Camp Withycombe. We
will entrnin and return to the regular
routine of the soldiers 's life."
Lieutenant Gingrich and Lieutenant
Allen were among thoso who looked as
if a soldier's life agreed with them.
Lieutenant Spaulding was not with the
company as he will travel with the quar
termaster's department. '
After remaining nt the depot about
45 minutes, the speciul left for Clack
umas, but as one mother suid, "It's all
right now as our dear boys are breath
ing the good old Oregon air and we
won't feel so bad if they do have to
stay a while at Clackamas."

In the early sets the Californiun

(United I'ress staff correspondent.)
London, Sept. 5. The Germans are
being pushed steadily eastward in a
renewal of the allies' great offensive
on the Somine, but in the Balkans the
Rumanian armies have been compelled
to give ground.
In a driving rain, the British ad
vanced 1,500 yards east of Guillemont
liiit night, capturing the whole system
of intricate German defenses at Falfe
mont and obtaining a footing in Leuse
wood, General Haig reported this aft
ernoon. Bad weather impended the de
velopment of the French offensive south
of the Sommc but the French this aft
ernoon reported the repulse of all Ger
man counter attacks.. The German war
office admitted the loss of the village of
Chilly to the French in yesterday's
fighting. Russian detachments have
been in action for the first time in the
defense of the southeastern frontier of
Rumania. The Germans and Bulgarian
forces, however, eontiuue to sweep on
into Rumania and have captured three
towns in the Dubruja region, including
Dobric. . .
The flat plain of the Duhurja region
offering no natural obstacles to an
enemy advance has greatly facilitated
the German-Bulgarian invasion. Unof
ficial dispatches from Berlin, today de
clared that not only are the German and
Bulgar armies pressing their invasion
but that the Austrians have halted
both wings of the Rumanian army that
invaded Transylvania.
The . Russians engaged in clearing
Austro-Germans from - the wooded
heights north of the Hungarian frontier,
have captured more enemy positions in
the Carpathians, it was officially an
nounced at Petrograd today, besides
taking 4,514 more prisoners in Volhynia
and Galicia.
Great Battle on Somme Front.
Paris, Sept. 5. Field Marshal Von
Hindenburg has arrived on the western
front for the first time since the be
ginning of the war and is urging his
commanders to a more stubborn defense
along the Somme, the Echo De Paris
stated today.
The "old man of Mauzurinn Lakes"
witnessed the retreat of the German
armies under smashing British and
French blows in Sunday and Monday's
fighting. It was the first great battle
in which the Teutons have been engaged
since Hindenburg was appointed chief
ot the German general staff.
The whole Somme battle front has
suddenly burst into activity with fur
ious infantry fighting slid soiae of the
most terrific shell blastings since the
Anglo-French offensive began. The Ger
mans are fighting desperately but in
the past 4H hours hnve been pushed
steadily eastward by impetuous French
attacks.
General Foch struck south of the
Somme yesterday while the mnin body
of Teuton reserves wns preparing to re
sist another great blow north of the
river. The French successes in this
new drive equalled the gains made north
of the river on the preceding duy.
Soyecourt has been been captured by a
storming attack, and extending their
gains far to the south, the trench oc
cupied the. village of Chilly. The out
skirts of three other villages were
seized and about three thousand prison
ers were taken.
While tnis great battle was going
on south of the Somme the Germans con
tinue their preparations for a counter
attack against position captured by
tho French and British in Sunday's
fighting north of the river. The heav
iest German blows are expected to fall
in the region of Chaulnes where the
French gains imperilled German posi
tions on a very wide front.
France's new 40 centimeter guns
ployed an important role in the new vic
tories over the Germans, according to
dispatches from the front today.
The existence of these guns wns kept
secret for many weeks. It is believed
it will work more wonders in the clos
ing days of the war than did the Oer
man 42 centimeters thnt battered in the
Belgian forts.
Since the beginning of the allied of
fensive on July 1 the French and Eng
lish have captured 20 vitiligos which the
Germans had organized to the highest
defensive degree. They have taken
about 41,000 prisoners, 150 cannon and
several hundred machine guns.
