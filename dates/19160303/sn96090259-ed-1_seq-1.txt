GLATTLT IN THE RACE
C.J. Glattly Democratic Candidate for Com
missioner Third District
B. J. Glattly, who recently sold bis
interests in the Olattly Lumber Com
pany to bis brother, just previous to
his departure for Detroit for a short
stay, desired the fact announced that
he would be a candidate on the dem
ocratic ticket at the primaries and fall
eleotion for the offloe of county com
missioner from the third district
comprising Hot Springs and Odell
townships.
Altho retiring from the lumber bus
iness he still has numerous other
interests here in the shape of real es
tate and banking but would have
ample time if elected to look after the
offloe of commissioner in a businesslike
B. J. GLATTLY
manner and would give tbe same oare
ful intention to the work that has
oharacterizen him in his own offloe.
He has been a resident of this city
for the past eight years and daring
that time has been connected with the
Commercial Club as one of its pres
idents and at the present time itB sec
retary and also one of the members of
the Association of Commercial Club
Secretaries of tbe Blaok Hills.
-He is very muoh interested in road
work and was one of the men who
platted the road from here to Winner
last year. Before ooming here he was
county auditor of Bremer county, Iowa
and is thoroughly conversant with the
olerioal end of tbe county business.
He will without doubt have no oppo
sition on tbe democratio ticket at tbe
primaries and if eleoted this fall wil 1
make no ideal man for the offloe.
RUGG FOR R. R. COMMISSIONER
Rapid City Man Visits This City in the Inter
ests of His Candidacy Wednesday
Fred H. Rugg. of Rapid City, was in
tbe oity Wednesday meeting tbe peo
ple here in tbe interests of Ills oandi-
daoy for the offloe of railroad oommie
sioner. Regarding bis qualifications
and fitness for tbe offloe the Rapid
City Daily Journal of recent date has
the following:
Fred H. Rogg, former mayor of
1 iapid Oity and one of the best known
men in tbe Hilla district, yesterday
formerally announced his candidacy
for the nomination of railroad commis
sioner from the third distriot on the
republican ticket at the oomiDg pri
maries. This action on the part of Mr.
Rugg cpmes, not as any especial solici
tation from hit» frieude, although mauy
of them have urged this action upon
him, but because Mr. Rugg himself
feels that he is able to give the people
of South Dakota the kind of service
they wish the railroad commissioner to
give. Before entering into the race
Mr. Rugg sent out over 200 letters to
representative men throughout the
state picking men in ninety-Qve dif
ferent oitteB and towns, and the ma
ority of these have all answered him,
telling him that in the eveut that be
become a candidate for tbe nomination
he would receive their good words and
support in their districts. It was prin
cipally through tbe attitude of these
letters that Mr. Rugg definitely made
up bis mind to plaoe himself in the
Bands of the people as a candidate. As
to bin qualifications for the position,
there can be little doubt but that he is
ibe logical man in this distriot. His
first seven years in tbe west were spent
on several of the larger railroads in the
oapaoity of construction engineer.
Later his work consisted of aooounting
in its various branches, such as retail
and wholesale merchandising and
banking, together with oonsidrrable
work in expert auditing. Suoh train
ing would prove moBt benefioial to a
man on tbe commission. Dr. Smith, of
Sturgis, tbe present commissioner from
the Blaok Hills district, will not be a
candidate for re-election. According
to law bis suocessor must come from
the third distriot. Mr. Rugg baa lived
in Rapid City for the past twenty
years. During that time he has been
mayor and president of the school
board as well as serving tbe oity in
other capacities. He has always been
a loyal booster of the Blaok .Hills dis
trict- As to politios he bas always
been in the republican party and there
is no doubt but that he oan stand on
his merits as a candidate and when
weighed in tbe balance will by no
means be found wanting. Mr. Rugg
has disposed of bis business interests
and is prepared to give all of bis time
to tbe offloe should be be eleoted.
SURVEY OF ROAD MATERIALS
State University Enfineer Says This Should
Be the First Step
Vermillion, S. D., March 3.—'That
there must be a thorough investiga
tion of road materials in South Da
kota preliminary to any comprehensive
plan for the development of the high
ways of tbe state is tbe oonviotion of
Professor J. Maugbs Brown, of tbe
College of engineering at tbe Univer
sity of South Dakota. Little
known at present, says Professor
Brown, about the location and nature
of the available road material of South
Dakota. This state, like other states,
mubt make the best possible use of its
naLural resources for road building
and in order to do that the people of
the state should know what these re
souroes are and where they oan be
found.
Gravel and sand -clay are the most
praotioal for the roads of the state
There is very little broken stone with
in the borders of South Dakota and
oonorete and macadam are out of the
question for st'-.fce muds except for
very short strips. The ofSr of $10,000
to $13,000 a milfi for concrete makes
for the most part prohibitive and ma
cadam is only slightly cheaper when
upkeep is considered. 1 is difficult
however to g«t gravel or sand-clay
many parts of the state, especially
where little or no attempt bas been
made to disoover or tap tbe deposits.
Tbe College of Engineering is at
present testing materials from differ
ent sections of the state and is propos
ing to undertake a survey for the defi
nite purpose of determining tbe loca
tion and nature of South Dakota's
road materials.

PLANS FOR
TIIMIITURE
MEETING OF ANGOSTURA ASSO
CIATION SATURDAY
PUSH PUBLICITY WORK
COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO RAISE
MONEY FOR FURTHERING 1RRI
GATION INTERESTS
By ChM. A. Nygtrom, Raipd City, Secretary
The regular meeting of the
Angos­
tura Association was held in Hot
Springs last Saturday. After discuss
ing the plans outlined at the state ir
rigation meeting held in Pierre some
weeks ago, ways and means for financ
ing the Angostura campaign, and for
co-operating with the state organiz
ation in pushing the publioity cam
paign for carrying the irrigation
amendment, were discussed. A com
mittee of four appointed to handle the
diffloult question of raising money,
made a report, which was adopted.
This report reoommends the raising
of $1,00Q or more to be used in further
ing our irrigation interests this year.
This suin is to be raised through con
tributions on the basis of $5 per quar
ter on all the irrigable land within tbe
projeot. Since there is so muoh at
stake, every man should be willing to
contribute this muoh per quarter,
whiob^it is believed, will not prove a
burden to anybody. It takes money,
and lots of work to oarry a proposition
of suoh magnitude, and every man
should lend a helping band. Since tbe
consummation of our day-dreams
would multiply tbe value of every acre
under the ditch, and benefloially affect
every town and bamlet adjacent to this
big projeot, it is hoped that self-inter
est and a desire to assist in a worthy
cause, will bring about a hearty re
sponse. No sooner had this plan been
decided upon than Ed Boohert, of Oral,
banded in his check for the first five
dollars, and C. A. Nystrom turned in
the seoond fiver.
it was also decided to ask the dif
ferent towns in Custer and Fall River
counties to contribute small amounts,
in lieu of the assessments heretofore
made. In this way everybody will be
assisting in the boosting campaign.
Those familiar with the Sootts Bluff
irrigation projeot say that our soil in
the Angostura i6 fully as good, or
better, the lay of the land is better,
and climatic conditions superior. Still,
they marketed a sugar beet crop tbe
past season for which the farmers re
ceived $2,163,000 in bard cash. Tbe
average income from beets alone per
acre was $70 42. While some of the
ground produced as high as $125 an
acre income, and some as low as $25,
THE BALANCING ROD.
Vi'"
PRINGS WEEKLY STAR.
O A a
more than $70 was the Average. The
factory produoed more than seventy
one million pounds of standard granu
lated sugar. If each sack of sugar is
tnirty inches lonp, a little elementary
figuring bhows that the sacks would
form one unbroken line of 33G miles if
placed end to end, or starting over the
North Dakota line this "sweet path"
would extend across South Dakota be
yond Omaha. Some sugar produoed on
an in igation projeot with conditions
not so favorable as on the Angostura.
Thiatis only part of what was produced
on onr neighboring project last year.
Possibly the total income from other
nrops will run into the millions.
Imagine what, two to five million dol
1Ks of new wealth turned loose iuto
the channels of trade in the Angostura
territory would mean! Is the game
worth the price? Then get busy and
be a booster, in word and deed. Now
is when we need your checks.

ENTERTAINED AT HIGHLEY'S
The Shakespeare Club Celebrates its Twentv
Tliird Birthday
Monday evening thirty ladies and
gentlemen gathered around the table
in the realdanoo of
1J.
E. Highley.
They were engaged in the pleasant task
of "interior decorating," the material
used being oyster cocktail, turkey,
salad, ices, etc. The oocasion was the
birthday party of the Shakespere Club.
Twenty-three years ago Mrs. A. B.
Connor, then a new-comer in Hot
Springs, missing the literary olub of
her home town, invited a few ladies to
her house—and the Shakespere Club
sprang into existanoe. It was there
fore fitting that she, the "mother of
the olub," should deliver an address of
weloome to the assembled guests. This
she did in her usual graceful manner.
E. B. Adams responded to the toast,
The Club Woman's Husband." The
pathos of the picture he drew was cal
culated to wring the hardest heart.
Mrs. Southard spoke on "Shakespeare's
Women." Her argument was that,
judging from the testimony of the
plays, the great poet has pronounced
the verdiot "perfectly nice" upon
womankind.
L. H. Hedriok following, responded
to the toast, "Woman." He took ex
ception to some of Mrs. Southard's
conclusions however, be was disposed
to "temper justice with meroy" and
closed his remarks by declaring that
though woman is the conundrum of
the age, she shall never be "given up."
Mrs. Jennings was toast-misti-ess of
the occasion. At the conclusion of
Mr. Hedriok's talk, she convulsed tbe
table with her witty observations on
"Man."
Mesdames Spenoer, Hedriok and F.
L. Hummel entertained the oompany
with brilliant instrumental music.
Charades followed.
Those present were: Mr. and Mrs.
E. B. Adams, Mrs. Helon Brelsford,
Mr. and Mrs. A. B. Connor, Mr. and
aud Mrs. Robert Connor, Mr. and Mrs.
L. H. Hedriok, Mr. and Mrs.* L. E.
