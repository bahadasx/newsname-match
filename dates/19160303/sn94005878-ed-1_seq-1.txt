cíes," the President wsole. but added
tnut, because of previous assurances,
lie must believe explanations putting
a different aspect on the sit nut ion
soon will be made.
White House, Feb. 21. 1ÍUC Mv
Dear Senator: I very warmly appre
ciato your kind and frank letter ol
to-day aud feel that It calls for an
equally frank reply You arc right in
assuming that 1 shall do everything in
my power to keep the United Stalet
out of war. I think the country wiU
feel id uneasiness uhout my course iu
that respect. Through many anxiout
months I have striven tor that object
amidst difficulties More manifold than
can have been apparent upon the sur
lace. uml ho far I have succeeded. I
do not doubt that 1 Mía II continue U
succeed.
"The course which the central Eu
ropean powers have announced tlieli
iutcutioii of following in the future
with regard to undersea warfare
seems for the moment to threaten lu
superable obstacles, but its apparent
meaning is so manifestly inconsistent
Willi explicit assurances recently giv
en us by those powers with regard tc
their treatment of merchaut vessel?
on the high seas that 1 must believe
that explanations will presently en
sue which will put a different aspect
upon it. We have had no reason tc
questiou their good faith or tbeir ft
delity to their promisee in the past
and I, for one, feel confident that wc
shall hare none In the future.
"But in any event our duty Is clear
No nation or group of nations has tut
right while the war Is in progress tc
alter or disregard the principles whicl
all nations have agreed upon in mitt
gation of tbe horrors and sufferings
of war, and if the clear rights ol
American citizens should ever un
happily be abridged or denied by any
such action, we should. It seems tt
me, have in honor no choice as tc
what our own course should be. Foi
my own part, I cannot consent to any
abridgement of the rights of Amerl
can citizens iu any respect. The hon
or and self-respect of the nation u
involved. We covet peace and shal
preserve It ut any cost, but the los:
of honor. To iorbld our people tc
exercise their rights for fear wi
might be called upon to vindicate
them would be a deep humiliation in
deed.
"It would be mi Implicit, all hut at
explicit, acquiescence in the violutiot
ot the rights of mankind evcrywher;
and of whatever nation or allegiance
It would be a deliberate abdication p
our hitherto proud position us spokes
men even amid the turmoil of war f'ii
the law and the light, It would m;.ki
everything this government has at
tempted and everything that it ha?
achieved during this terrible struggle
of nations meaningless and futile.
"It is Important to reflect that if it
this instance we allowed expediency
to take the place ot principle, th
door would Inevitably be opened tt
still further concessions. Once accept
a single abatement of right and main
other humiliations would certainly fol
low and the whole fine fabric of Inter
national law might crumble under out
bands, piece by piece. What wc ar
contending for iu this matter is o:
the very essence of the things thai
have made America a sovereign na
tion. She cannot yield them withoui
conceding her own Impotency as f
nation and making virtual surrendci
ot her Independent position among th
nations of the world.
"I am speaking, my dear senator. Ir
deep solemnity withoui heit, Kith i
clear consciousness of the high, re
sponsibilities of my office, and n
your sincere nnd devoted friend. II
we should unhappily differ, we slii.ll
differ as friends, but where Issues tc
momentous as these are involved m
must, Just because we are frlen Is
speak our minds without reservation
Faithfully yours,
"WOODROW WILSON."
The President's letter was In on

manda had been made for some action
