2nd. We condemn the Uuik i -wood
Tariff law, as it has
brought disaster to American
Industry and untold suffering to
the laboring men of tho United
States, and would have bank
rupt the treasury of the Uni
ted States but for the alleged
War Tax imposed upon the
American people in time of
peace, and hereby renew our

Mexican policies.
;0ur judgement
This policy in '

about the death of more than

i W "V AA
We condemn that policy of the .

the lives and property of Ameri
can eitizena are endangered and
destroyed with impunity by for

relations with foreign govern
ments were due entirely to the

'on tho part of President Wilson.

Public
Life
After thirty-two of his seventy
five years spent in public service,
James B. McCreary, who recent
ly retired from the governorship
of Kentucky, announces that he
is through with public office.
Mr. McCreary served six years
:n the Kentucky legislature and
was elected governor of the
state in 1S75 when he was thirty
two years old. After that lie
was elected to the house of rep
resentative where he served
twelve years and then was trans
ferred to the other end of the
capitol as a United states sena
tor. For several years after the
expiration of his senatorial term
ho vi- i private citizen, only to
(-.iter again the political field as
a candidate for governor, and he
is the only man on record who
was twice elected governor of
Kentucky after a long lapse of
years.
"I look back on my first cam
paign for governor with a great
deal of pleasure," said Governor
McCreary. "It was that cam
paign that probably gave to the
United States Supreme court
bench one of its most respected
and valuable members. My op
ponent in that fight was John
Marshall Harlan. Not long af
ter the election I had the oppor
tunity of recommending that
President Hays appoint Harlan
to the Supreme court bench."
