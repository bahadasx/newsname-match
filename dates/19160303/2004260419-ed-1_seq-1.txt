BASKETBALL GAME
Probably the basketball of the
soason was played last Friday night,
Feb. 25. A preliminary gamo was
played between tho sixth grado and a
High School freshman tum, which
resulted In a victory of 24 to 10 for
tho freshmen.
An attempt was made to schedule'
a gamo with tlio Scappooso High
School team nnd the St. Helens High
School Midgets, but no word was re
ceived from Scappooso. However,
a team called the lloo I loos, was
made up, which proved successful.
Tho line-up was: I loo lloos, Welling
ton, f; McDonald, f; Robertson, s;
Zysett, g; Hall, g; Drouse, sub.
Midgets, Southard, f; Davlus, f;
Stanwood, s; Faxon, g; Lake, g;

Although the scoro Is ono-slded,
much credit Is due the Midgets, as
they showed the old fight and play
ed a good game for they were out
classed by older and more experi
enced players. If the midgets keep
up, they will have a strong team in
a year or so. Zysott went out of the
game In the latter part of the first
half with a cut eyebrow. The fea
ture of the game was Southard
throwing a basket from center.
OREGON GAME IN MOVIE
The splendid exhibition of Oregon
fish and . game and Oregon scenery
given at the Strand Friday aftornoon

great exponse but are certainly worth
the price. This entertainment was
brought here under the auspices of
the St. Helens Rod and Gun Club,
also the fish with which streams near
here will be stocked, will be through
the efforts of that organization.

SECOND COUNT, MAR. 7
On Tuesday evening, March
7, at 3:30 o'clock, the ballot box In
the Mist Popular Voting Contest will
be closed for the second count for
leadership in one of the most inter
esting events which has been pulled
off in St. Helens.
A little exertion and hustling
among the contestants Is what is
required to win, and tho one who
is the most active and who uses the
best Judgment and business senso in
her canvass is the one who will land
the prize. It will come without the
expenditure of a penny to the one
who captures the prize, but eternal
hustling will be the price of success.
Are you going to win it? Or are
you going to take a vacation and let
the other girl beat you to It? And
probably by a very few votes at that.
All the votes cast during the entire
contest will determine who is to get
the piano. There is nobody so far
ahead, according to the first count,
but what-a little hustling on the part
of the other contestants would place
them right up among the leaders.
New subscribers are what count the
most in this contest, because for
every new subscriber brought in, the
person bringing it in Is entitled to
COO votes, and 600 votes is given
for each renewal, while 400 votes
are given with each back subscrip
tion.
Bear in mind that the ballot box
wll be closed at 3:00 o'clock Tues
day evening, March 7. Be sure and
have all your votes In by that time,
so you will have had a fair chance
to show what your standing is. As
soon as the ballot box Is closed the
count will be made and the result
announced as quickly as it is known.
The following merchants are giv
ing 26-vote merchants' coupons with
each $1.00 cash purchase:
