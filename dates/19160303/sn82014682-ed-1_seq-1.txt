Tlie president's policy of standing for the right of neutrals to trav

. The president today told congressional leaders that it was monthi
after Bryan's resignation before the United States was abl? to convince
Germany that Americans are in earnest in their position rgarding sub
marine warfare.. It is understood he mentioned, this to sliow his belief
that Congress could further! weaken the position of the United States
abroad by fll-adyised action now.

willing to sacrifice anything except honor in maintaining peace. ." . -

one close to war or to national abandonment and humiliation.'
