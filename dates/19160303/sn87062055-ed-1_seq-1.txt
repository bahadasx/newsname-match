RiOIDS WILL NOT HANDLE
LIQUOR UNLESS FORGED TU
Railroads which do an interstate
freight business into Arizona are not
going to accept for transportation
shipments of liquor consigned to
points within this state, even if the
consignees swear on a stack of Bibles
that they intend to employ the joy
jnice for purely personal use. Not
until somebody goes into court and
compels them to do so, anyway.
This decision was reached at a
meeting held in the Hotel Adams,
Phoenix, last Tuesday, attended by
attorneys for the El Paso & South
western, Southern Pacific and Santa
Fe systems. There was not a dissent
ing voice when' the final vote was
taken.
The railroads don't want liquor
business and are not going to handle
it unless-compelled to do so.
Before they came to Phoenix the at
torneys had read the decision of the
supreme court in the now famous
Sturgeon "personal use" case. They
were convinced that the transporta
tion of liqurs into Arizona for per
sonal use is not in violation of the
prhibition amendment or the Webb
Kenyn act But they were also con
vinced that whenever a railroad or
express company delivered a consign
ment of liquor it must be prepared to
prove that the consignee intended the
liquor for personal use. Moreover, they
would have to run the risk of a sud
den change of intention and selling or
giving away the aforesaid liquor, in
violation of the state constitution.
"A mere affidavit from a consignee
that he did not intend to use the.
liquor for an unlawful purpose would
not be sufficient to clear a railroad of
. complicity in a violation of the prohi
bition amendment should the con
signee not follow out his declared in
tention," said Gibson Taylor, secre
tary and chief attorney, for the Ari
zona Eastern, who was present at the
meeting and took a deep interest in
the proceedings.
"Too much of a burden is placed on
the railroads. We simply cannot af
ford to accept liquor shipments under
, the circiunstances. Nor are. we going
into curt to endeavor to prove that
the carrier which delivers a shipmen
of intoxicating liquor assumes no re
sponsibility. Someone may go into
court to force us to accept shipments
hut it is not our intention to take any
steps to bring about a test"
Looks Suspicious
A marriage license was issued this
morning .to Charles A. Lindstrom, of
Williams and Dora Ettie Hayes, of
Phoenix. Phoenix Gazette.
The many friends of Lindstrom in
this section will be interested in- hear
ing that he is married. He is logging
foreman for the Saginaw & Manistee
Lumber Co. at one of the Bellemont
camps.
Never Used It Since
Over thirty years ago tho Courier
man bought an iron wheelbarrow from
Hon. John G. Campbell, who ran a
store about where Judge Donald
Campbell's cigar store is now located.
The price paid for that barrow was
$25 and it is still in commission and
good for more years than its owner.
A barrow of similar make can now be
bought for about seven dollars and a
half. Prcscott Courier.
SUPERIOR COURT DOINGS
Frank Harrison, formerly steno
grapher in the Forest Service, has
been appointed court reporter by
Judge F. W. Perkins in place of Fred

of persecution and thought some one
was going to kill him.

BUFFALO BAND GIVE AN
AUTOMOBILEJXCITING CHASE
Lee Simmons, the auto man, anil
Earl H. Parker, a civil engineer of
Phoenix, had the novel as well as ex
citing experience last week of being
chased by a band of buffalo in the
House Rock valley vountry, north of
the Grand Canyon.
They made the trip by auto to Lee's
Ferry and into the House Rock valley
country in fifteen hours running time.
After the survey work was completed
by Mr.Parker, they started homo and
run into a band of buffalo and cattle
maintained in that section of the
country by a big cattle company, a
remnant of the Buffalo Jones outfit.
Tho buffalo were, not very well ac
quainted with tho new contrivance
called auto and straight way charged
it in a body. For awhile the machine
did not make much headway in the
sand, but when they struck good'roads
the bunch of buffalo were rapidly left
in the rear bawling their disgust at
losing the race.
The return trip to Flagstaff was
made in record time without further
1 excitement.
SEDONA NEWS NOTES
Antonio Chavez was up from Red
Rock Tuesday looking nftcr his cattle
in this section.
Charles Stemmer returned from a
business trip to Clarkdale Monday.
He found the road very muddy and
the Verde' river rather high.
It is understood that Mr. George
W. Black jr. has taken on option on
the Scdona hotel and ranch which be
longs to Mrs. Mary A Stemmer. The
deal is expected to close about March
first.
E. M. Hart, Fred Moore, Roe Smith,
Mh. Wcems and another man returned
from Clarkdale Monday bringing with
them the balance of the bridge. They
had some pieces forty feet long. The
roads were very muddy and they ex
perienced considerable difficulty in
getting through.
An enjoyable leap year dance was
given by the ladies of Scdona on the
18th of the mqnth. About 20 couples
were present. Jesse Purtyman and
Thomas Chavez furnished the. music
on the accordion and guitar. Among
those present from below were Mr.

On Sunday morning February 20th,
the last mixing of cement was poured
into the form of the west abutment
of the Oak Creek bridge and Moriday
following contractor Raudebaugh left
Sedona for Clarkdale, thence to his
home in Flagstaff. While up against
it for some few days on the excava
tion for the foundation of the west
abutment nevertheless Mr. Raude
baugh got through in good season
with all his work and what he has
done will be in evidence when our suc
cessors by a few hundred years will
be doing archaelogical research work.
George Black jr. is busily engaged
in grading up to the cast abutment of
the bridge. lie expects to begin grad
ing on the west side in about three

is completed.
Do You Know Geo. L. McKitrick?
Relatives are anxiously inquiring
for him and any information ad
dressed to Mrs. Nellie Lemons, post
mistress at Johnson, Arizona, box 28,
would be appreciated.
Feature Plays Only
The policy of the Empress theatre,
Flagstaff's new photoplay theatre
which opened last Wednesday night,
will be to run on an all feature pro
gram. The management is heartily in
accord with the "better films" idea
and will spare no expense to present
the very best feature pictures on, the
market.
New Williams School Trustee
Mr. W. D. Finney of Williams, was
appointed school trustee for the Wil
liams district last Saturday morning
by Miss Lenore Francis, county super
intendent of schools, to fill the vacan
cy on the board in place of Mrs.
Andrew Miller. A regular school
election in all districts will take place
March 25th.
J THE POLITICAL
ARE SAYING
What shall the harvest be? It's a
question hardly spoken aloud, but
those who would serve the people the
coming two years in Coconino county,
are willing to listen to the answers
and are interested as arc many who
do not intend to ask for political pre
ference. In the state campaign Coconino
county is apt to have three or four
candidates for places. H. E. Campbell
may decide later to cast his cap in the
merry-go-round for governor on the
democratic ticket along with Governor
Hunt and George A. Olney. Olney
and Hunt are now avowed candidates.
Thomas Maddock will in all probabili
ty be a candidate for corporation com
missioner on the republican state
ticket and Jesse Boycc will strenuous
ly endeavor to be present when the
nomination for state auditor is passed
out by the democrats in convention
assembled.
Reports are current that Miss Le
nore Francis has been urged to make
the race for the nomination for state
superintendent of schools. Time will
decide, also Miss Lenore may have her
own idea of the matter later in the
game.
We Have With Us In Coconino
From recent information received
from Attorney General Wiley -Jones,
there will be no supervisoral districts
in Coconino county this year. He de
cides that the districts made by tho
last .board of supervisors were illegal
ly compiled, consequently nul, void
and to bo disregarded.
Consequently, therefore the new or
present board of supervisors can not
lay out new supervisor districts until
September 1st, which will be too late
for any political purposes at the No
vember election. Apparently, as a
side squint at the supervisoral game,
it looks Jike a free for all play with
location and previous condition of
servitude utterly disregarded. Those
who deside to be recognized may now
kick off their heavy shoes and pull for
the high jumps.
Among the democrats we have with
us, mentioned, spoken of and some
determined, as follows:
For State Senator H. E. Campbell,
Ray Babbitt, Charles Jones, J. M.
Holub, X. N. Steeves.
For Representative Will Marlar,
F. E. Wells, Ben Sweetwood, Mercer
Hcmperlcy.
For Sheriff W. G.Dickinson, Chas.
Lindstrom, J. W. Frances, Robert
Bums.
For Treasurer S. S.. Acker, Tom
PETER COLLINS LECTURE
WILL BE ENTERTAINING
On Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock
March 12th at the Court House, Peter
W. Collins, an eminent Bostonian, will
deliver a lecture on the subject
"What's Wrong with the World?" He
Collins is one of the most gifted and
polished speakers appearing on the
American platform today. He is a
scholar a deep student of ethics, of
religion, of political economy. But he
is not a "high-brow," and his lec
ture will be enjoyed as much by a day
laborer as by a college professor. The
lecture is to be under the auspices of
the Knights of Columbus and admis
sion will be free. There will be no
collection of any kind and everybody
is invited to attend, regardless of
creed. Mr. Collins will be glad to an
swer questions during or at the con
clusion of his lecture, and explain in
detail the points he makes; or ad
vance arguments against or give rea
sons for theories advanced by people
in the audience.
Cheap Wrecking Work
The contract for wrecking the court
house has been awarded to George M.
White, his bid being ?2,358. Prescott
Courier.
Yavapai is a democratic county and
the above would indicate that for fear
of a republican victory this year the
democrats were willing to pay $2,358
for wrecking the court house before
republicans got into it
Leg Badly Broken By Log
Jack Huff had his left leg broken in
two places at the F. L. M. mill Satur
day while unloading logs into the mill
pond. An extra long log came off the
loaded car when released, striking
him below the thigh cutting a deep
wound and breaking the bone in two
places. George Nichols who was with
him narrowly escaped being injured
with the same log. Huff was rushed
immediately to the Milton hospital
after the accident occurred.
-ADVANCE DOPE SHEET
L. Rees, James Kennedy. ,
For County Recorder Dan Cronin,

For County Attorney F. M. Gold,

For Constable-rFrank Fairchild,
Dave Lovell.
This seems to b'e a fairly complete
round-up of local political affairs as
they present themselves for.thc de
mocratic side of the scrambulation.
Of course it is reasonable to believe
that if Miss Lenore Francis was the
nominee for county superintendent in
stead of state superintendent of
schools, that J. W. Francis would not
be a candidate for sheriff. '
On the Other Hand As It Were
The republicans have been mixing
medicine, also mentioning names that
would seem to fill the spaces grace
fully on their ticket at the next elec
tion. For State Senator M. I. Powers,
M. J. Riordan, H. C. Hibben.
For Representative L. F. Ver
kamp, T. H. Cuerton, F. 0. Twitty.
For Sheriff J. 0. Harrington, W.

For County Superintendent of
Schools Mrs. Frank N. Noble.
For Constable Henry Cooper, John
Metz, W. B. Raudebaugh.
For Justice of the Peace N. G.
Layton.
The grand gathering of men andj
mentions of men should at least afford
a good selection as primary times
draw near. It is probable at this
early date we have missed a few who
will not be missed at the primaries
or at the election.
SCHUBERT SYMPHONY CLUB
GIVES PLEASING CONCERT
The concert given last evening at
the Elks' home by the soloists of the
Schubert Symphony club was a real
treat and was greatly enjoyed by a
large and critical audience of music
lovers.
Leeta Corder's beautiful soprano
voice of wonderful range and sweet
ness captured the audience and the
charm of her delightful 'personality
completed the conquest. Her redition
of "Balletella" from "Pofliancei" held
the audience spellbound by its beauty
and dramatic power, as well as being
an example of unsurpassed voice con
trol. Lavina Zandt has a deep contralto
voice of great beauty and power. Her
solo, "The Nightingale's Lulaby,"
composed by Purcell, pleased the
audience particularly well, as it
seemed exactly suited to the musical
quality of her voice, which is of ex
ceptional volume and richness.
The violin plaing of Thomas Pur
cell was of great brilliance and feel
ing as well as unusually strong in
technique. His playing of the "Hun
garian Gypsy Dance" was a remark
ably beautiful performance.
Those present expressed their ap
proval by repeatedly encoring the ar
tists, who were most generous in re
sponding. The Elks are to be con
gratulated upon their enterprise and
good taste in bringing such a fine at
traction to Tonopah. Tonopah Daily
Bonanza.
They will be at the Empress Thea
tre, Flagstaff, Monday night, March
6th. They please.
Gambling Is Still Illegal
John Proctor, Harry Graham, Al
Jennings and two John Does were
arrested Sunday for gambling in the
Proctor & Deck pool hall and tried
before Judge Harrington Monday,
Proctor was fined $100 and the other
two men were given a suspended sen'
tence of 90 days.
FLAGSTAFF WILL HAVE A '
NEW DEMOCRATIC PAPER
As additional evidence that Flag
staff is prospering, a new democratic
paper is to be established here if'it is
given sufficient support by local de
mocrats. Craig Pottenger and A. B.
Cowdery, two young men who have
been working on the Phoenix Gazette
are the promoters of. the scheme and
are being backed by local democratic
capital. Flagstaff has long needed
another newspaper as it will put more
snap in the game and permit a more
free and liberal presentation of exist
ing conditions pro and con.
We realize The Sun has been
lamentably weak along this line and
the much needed competition will have
a tendency to stir up "dry bones,"
more thoroughly, advertise Flagstaff
generally by calling entrenching tools
,by their proper names and getting
action for the people.
Flagstaff is growing steadily and
there is plenty of room for all who
care to come and assist in the up
building of a prosperous little city.
The idea of the promoters of the
scheme, is not only to make the new
democratic paper a local opefbut to
add Winslow, Holbrook, Williams and
Ash Fork to their territory, eventually
covering the jvhole northern jart .of
the state for party purposes.
Monday Eevening Fire
The small residence of David Lay
on West Birch avenue was. quite ex
tensively damaged by fire Monday
evening. The fire was discovered in
the kitchen at about 8 o'clock. Chief
Fireman See got away with the auto
truck on record time but struck a soft
trench in two blocks of the fire and
"shucked" about twenty men off the
truck when it stuck.
The fire originated from the kitch
en stove which got too warm and
started a fire in a woodbox, adjoining.
The interior of the kitchen
was
burned to a cinder,
The remainder of j
the house was not damaged.

A Neighbor's Pet Calf .
Recce Watkins was arrested last
Friday at his ranch in the Doney j
Park country northeast of Flagstaff .
charged with having killed a pet calf
belonging to a' neighboring rancher.
It is claimed that the rancher missed
his calf and traced it in the snow to'
Watkins' plae and there found evi
dence that it had been slaughtered.
Stock Inspector Tom Eakins and Un
dersheriff F. L. Dickinson made the
arrest Friday and further investigated
the circumstances surrounding the
killing of the calf. Watkins was
placed under $1500 bonds by Judge
Harrington to await trial in the su- J
perior court. !
River dc Flag Working at Cliffs
River de Flag has been spnding
water down the line so strong the
past few weeks that it is running
though the culvert built under the
right of way at the Big Fill in suf
ficient quantities to flood the Green
law logging road and stop traffic
there temporarily. Chas. McGonigle,
the mill superintendent came in Wed
nesday and reported the temporary
shut down of the mill on account of
the water. .
Richard Jose Coming
At the Empress Theatre will be
offered the last word in entertainment
that no one should miss secincr.

appear at every performance in per
son, the sweet singer and actor in the
star role, supported by an all star
cast of well known people. The story
of the photoplay will grip your heart
and hold you spellbound. From the
start to finish, a blending of heart in
terest, quaint and sensitive, with the
most unexpected punches that leave a
lasting impression and make you feel
better for having seen it pure in tone
and theme and humor to please all
from six to sixty.
COUNCIL HAD INTERESTING .
SESSIONJONDAY NIGHT
The city Council wound up the busi
ness of the month of February Monr
day night in an important meeting.
The city marshal was ordered to
close up the Proctor & Deck pool hall
on account of the gambling case!
which he did Tuesday morning.
The license of Louis do Miguel for
a Mexican dance hall over on the '
south side was also ordered closed be
cause of complaints made of the noise .
late at night disturbing other resi
dents. T. E. Pollock appeared before the
council relative to the proposed pav
ing of the streets this spring and pro
posed that property owners do away
with the long, tedious, technical bond
system with all its ramifications and,
cost and pave the streets under pri
vate contract. He agreed to person
ally see property owners and secure
their signatures to an agreement or
bond, .binding them for the necessary
payments. All the details of the plan
were not worked out, but in the main
the proposition was favored by the
council and it is probable1 that this
system will be tried, since there are
few if any real objections to street
paving. ,
Bowl'ng Alley Opened Again
The old bowling alley and lunch
room on Railroad avenue formerly
run by Rickel & Kisker, has been pur
chased by George L. Woolacott of
Chicago, who is renovating the place
ready for opening it up the first of
the week.
Serious Accident Narrowly Averted
Brakeman Ray Finney came near
being run over and seriously injured,
if not killed Tuesday afternoon by be
ing bumped off the track by an over
grown .boxcar. The local was stand
ing on the track east of the -water
tank for water with a couple cars be-
hind it; a through freight train cut
off and run the engine down to water
the water tank for water, then backed
into the local with a big healthy
bang. Finney was just walking around
the end of a box car when the bump
occurred. He was thrown about ten
feet by the bump and will have sore
spots on him for several days.
Want Guard Company at Williams
Captain Oscar Temple of the ad-
jutant general's office, and Captain
Cromwell Stacey, will go to Williams
in a few days where they will attend
to some matters incidental to the o'r-
ganization of the new company of the
natinal guard at that place. Republi-
can.
Tailor bliop Ituined liy tire
The tailor shop run and owned by
Ike Moses on Lcroux street in the
rear of the McMillan building was dis-
covered on fire along about 3 o'clock
n the morning baturday.
The fire originated in the basement
in a manner that aroused the suspi
cions of the officers and a thorough
examination of the case was made.
If they discovered any clues, none
were given out.
The interior of the shop was com-
J pletely wrecked and the floor had to
be chopped in to reach the fire in the
basement.
! Mnsns claims that a counle suits of
clothes are missing and that his place
had been visited before during the
night by some one who was evidently
acquainted with it.
TRAINMEN COMPLAIN OF
BOYS' "FLIPPING" TRAINS
Strange as it may seem, many
trainmen are really human and wor
ry more about injuring people than
they are given credit for. Recently a
conductor asked us to warn young
boys against jumping on trains for a
short ride. "Just the other day I saw
a boy fall off the train as we were
pulling out of the Flagstaff yards.
No one knows how it makes a fellow
feel when he sees things of that kind.
You can't do a thing to help as it all
occurs in a few seconds the reckless
fellow is cither kiled, maimed,
mangled or escapes as he is lucky or
unlucky."
Engineers complain also of so many
young people taking a stroll up the
track, talking and laughing seemingly
unconscious of their danger Until the
train bears down on them only a short
distance away. While they haven't
hit any one of these jaunting parties
as yet, it has added numerous grey
hairs to the engineers' heads and they
are always praying that the people,
young or old will allow the railroad
company to use the tracks for trains.
A double track is always dangerous
even to old employees in the railroad
business.
