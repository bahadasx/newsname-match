ruary 21), Hence His Birthdays
Are Few—Enjoyable Party
in Honor of Event
While Richard Hanna, the college
herdsman, passed his 44th milestone
last Tuesday, he claims the unusual
distinction of having had only i '
birthdays, his natal da) falling on
the 29th of February, a date that
finds its way to the calendar only
once in four years, In honor of the
extraordinary occasion, a number of
the friends of the efficient he.dsman
journeyed to the Hanna home on the
college farm Tuesday evening to en
joy a dinner party 'n celebration of
tho event. A well appointed five
course dinner was followed by
Scotch music and games typical of
the Highlands. Original poems, ha',
ing to do with the widely separated
birthdays of the honored gue«t,
were read by Mrs. M. J. Chapman
and Prof. George Severance. The
latter presented Mr. Hanna with a
pair of military hair brushes as a
birthday gift from tha merrymakers.
In his presentation speech Prof. Sev
erance took.advantage of the oppor
tunity to land the most excellent
work of Mr. Hanna as overseer of
the college live stock,, also eulogiz
ing his good work in the same capac
ity at Quelph, Ontario.
In his response, Mr. Hanna char
acteristically refused a large amount
of the credit which was given him

the college herd now boasts three
heifers which can* not be beaten by
any animals in the Northwest.

PULLMAN. WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, MARCH 3. 1916

Mil' business and residence sections

The biggest improvement in the
business part of town ill be the fine

square, and the contract will be let

structure will be practical!) re-built
from the foundation and a second
story, containing a Masonic lodge
hall and a number of offices, will be
added. A. Valk now has a force cf
men at work reinforcing the founda

Sam Cameron is figuring on erect
ing a two-story brick on his East
Main street lots opposite the .lack
son building and the Pullman laun
dry has under consideration the erec

of its present frame structure. It
is also rumored that a new brick

Improvements in the residence
district are already well under way.
Dr. A. E. Shaw has practically re
built his house em Spaulding street,
which was gutted by fire last sum

built for P. E. Sanger in his addition
Phone Merger May be Expensive
i
City Will Probably Lose $1700 as
Result of Consolidation of Two
(panics Franchise Tax
Involved
The city of Pullman will in till
probability lose $1700 in good money
its a result of the sale last sum
mer by the Pacific States Telephone
and Telegraph company of its
local exchange to the Inland
Co-operative cvompany, that sum
representing the tax money which
would have accrued to the city dur
ing the six years which the Pacific
franchise has to run. The Inland
company, by reason of the consoli
dation, gained a monopoly on all the
local exchange business, the Pacific
company maintaining only its long
distance switchboard, and that in
connection with the Inland tele-
Iphones. The Inland company, at the
j time of the consolidation last sum
mer, was operating under a free
! franchise, which does not expire for
, 11 years, granted at the time when
jthe Inland line catered only to the
farmer trade and made no bid for
the general local business. Officials
lof that company claim that their
company, now alone in the field, can
, ; still operate under the old franchise,
| which was quite liberal in scope, thus
Ithrowing the tax burden of the Pa
ciflce franchise upon the latter com
pany, although they maintain only
; tin- long distance switchboard.
An informal meeting of city COUn
cilmen was held Monday evening,
| when the entire matter was consid
ered with C. E. Hickman, general
manager for the Pacific company,
ami the consensus of opinion of the
City fathers was that the tax could
j not be assessed against the Inland
: ! company and that it would be hard
ily fair to force the payment upon
the? Pacific company. The latter
: course, it is feared by the council
; men, might result in the withdrawal
from the field of the Pacific com
pany, leaving Pullman Isolated as far
i as long distance telephone service is
concerned.
and the contract calls tor its com
pletion by April 1. Mr, Sanger in
tends to build another bungalow dur

F. N. Bryant expects to have work
started in the next fen weeks on an
attractive home on Monroe street.
VV. A. .Moss will build three and
possibly four pretty homes on hit

Route street.
F. T. Barnard expects to build on
his property on North Monroe street.
VV. C. Kruegel will move the house
which he is now occupying back
from California street and erect a
fine colonial residence in its stead.
F. O. Brownson has purchased a
lot on Colorado street from Chester
F. Anderson and intends to build a
nice home on it.
Dr. L. Q. Kimzey has let the con
tract for the- erection of a large and
handsome residence on his Star
Route property.
.1. R. Ruply plans to build a nine
room residence on the lots at the
corner of Star Route and Oak streets
whuh he recently purchased from
M. K. Snyder.
E, 11. Babcock expects to erect a
five-room bungalow on his property
at the corner of Colorado and I'
streets, back of the music conserv
atory building.
Leo Allen lias plans prepared for a
fine residence which he expects to
build on his Ash street lot.
V. VV. Clarkson expects to soon
have plans prepared tor a modern
house to be built on his Oak street
property.
Dr. Beistel has the plans for a
house which he expects to have erect
ed on Maiden Lane, but may defer
building until next year.
F. V. Roth and J. M. Palmerton
are both planning to build brick
houses em their Slat" street property
and ii number of other property own
ers have caught the building fever
and are industriously studying house
plans and figuring em ways and
means.
Alter a somewhat lengthy discus
sion, pro and con. the councilmen
concluded to strike from the Pacific
franchise those sections calling for a
franchise tax and to provide that in
case the Pacific company re-enters
the field they may operate under the
present franchise, but must pay the
stipulated taxes for the years during
which the sections were not en
forced. The question will be given
Official consideration at the council
meeting next Tuesday evening, and
it is expected that a large number ol
council fans will be on hand to wit
ness the proceedings.
Under the terms of the 10-year
franchise under which the Pacific
company was operating, the company
was required to pay $200 a year dur
ing the first five years of the life
of the franchise and $300 per year
for the remaining five years.
The ordinance granting the fran
chise became effective in February
of 1912 and the company paid three
of the $200 yearly payments before
their lines were taken over by the
Inland company. The fourth pay
ment is clue this month, and this the
company agrees to pay. leaving one
$200 payment and the five $300 , ay
ments yet unearned by the city, an
aggregate of $1700, which will prob
ably be lost to the city under the
proposed arrangement.
The unofficial action of the city
fathers is in direct contradiction to
their official action of last summer,
when, previous to tbe consollda:! >i.,
they went emphatically on record as
opposed to waiving tin franchise, lax
regardless of the merger plans of the
two companies, but councilmen who
attended the informal meeting st no
that there is no alternative in the
matter.
Dr. and Mrs. Holland of Blooming

NUMBER 20
ONCE PULLMAN BOY
NOW FAMOUS TENOR
Tlieo. Karle Johnston, Former Itesl
dent of This City, Given Great
Ovation in Seattle
Another Pullman boy has made
good and won for himself a high po
sition In the musical world. When
he lived in Pullman and attended
school he was known as Theo. Carl
Johnston, son of Mrs. A. B. Ford.
About live years ago he went to Se
attle' with his mother. Since that
time he has developed into a won
derful tenor singer. Last October
liis teacher, EDdmond S. Myer, took
the young man, who is now 22 years
old, east. He met with remarkable
sine in New York and is signed to
sing the role of Don Jose In Carmen
with Geraldine Farrar. in 22 per
formances. He is also to appear In
40 concerts with Josef Stransky's
New York Philharmonic orchestra of
125 pieces, and the Victor grapho
phone people have given him a year's
contract, He passed up several New
York engagements in order to visit
In. mother in Seattle and appear
there in a concert with tin- Philhar
monic orchestra. Success has not
spoiled him ami he is said to be the
same modest young man he was be
fore going east, except that he now
spells his middle name Karle instead
of Carl. Reporting the concert, a
Seattle' paper said:
"For the two appearances last
week Karlo journeyed across the
continent, lured primarily by a boy
ish longing to see the folks at home,
and secondarily by a plump stipend,
the proportions of which would have
tempted many of the great stars of
which the world has long read.
"When he appeared from the
wings to sing the aria, "0 Paradise."
from L'Afrlcana, by Meyerbeer, early
in Wednesday evening's program,
the' roar of applause from a capacity
audience at the- Metropolitan the
atre was as sincere as it was tumultu
ous; it. lasted for three minutes and
ho had not yet sung a note. Through
the volume' of harmony from an or
chestra of 56 the clear, virile, ii
brant voice came, without apparent
effort, every delicious bit distinct
and authoritative.
"The demonstration that followed
consumed seven minutes, during
which the youth appeared time and
again, making that characterise de
vout homage before the shrine of his
art in acknowledgment of the appre
ciation manifested, choosing to up
hold the rigid ethics which preclude
an encore following a solo selected
with a definite fitness to tho pro
gram, and sharing only equal honors
with his peer, Director Spargir,
under whose magic baton the ore ie_
tra had just concluded the Moz i.*t
Symphony in G minor.
'While this scene was being enact
ed on the stage half a dozen e«ni
formed firemen patrolled the the
atre entrance, debarring huni.-e.is
who sought admission regardless of
the restrictions of th,3 fire ordinance.
Stub a sequence might have hee.
anticipated had the artist on the
stage been Caruso, Tetrazzlni or
Schuman-Helnk."
KNIGHTS IN JOLLIFICATION
Bound by a pre-contest agreement
to provide entertainment for '.he
winners of the attendance contest re
cently conducted by Evening Star
lodge. Knights of Pythias, the losers
in the unique contest last Monday
evening made good with a ven
geance, providing entertainment and
"eats" not only for the winning
Knights, but for their ladles as well.-
A mock trial, In which a jury of 12
women found B. N. Hlnchllff not
guilty of lack of Pythian spirit In
that he visited the social session
without a female companion, was
one of the features of the evening.
With an eloquent plea for the inde
pendence of single blessednss and a
biting tirade against the evils of
henpecked married life, the de
fendant touched the heart strings of
the jurors, the great majority of
whom were married women, and won
his liberty.
Cards, dancing and refreshments
constituted a highly enjoyable even
ing's entertainment.
