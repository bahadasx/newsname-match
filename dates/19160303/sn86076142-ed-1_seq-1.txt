Nothing definite has yet been ac
complished In the arrangements for
the semi-finals and finals in the con
test for the championship of the state

time It seem exlremely likely, how
ever, that the semi-finals, in which
Tonopah and lovelock are pitteG
against each other for the champion

tlons, will bo played In Reno on the
evening of March 11. The winners of
this game will then play Reno, the

tlons, in Reno some time the follow

If this Plan Is finally adopted the

WASHINGTON, Mar. 3. By a vote of sixty-eight to fourteen, a
greuter majority than they expected, the administration forces In
the senate tabled Senator .Gore's resolution to warn Americans off
of armed ships of the belligerents, and thereby finally quelled In
the senate the agitation which e.mbarassed the president in his
submarine negotiations with Germany. Gore's resolution and a '
substitute by McCuuiber, a Repub'ican, an attempt by Gore to
strengthen his original proposal, nil were defeated at one time on
roll call on motion by James, on ? of the administration whips, to
table them.. The administration victory transferred the fight to the
house. In attempting to strengthen the original resolution. Gore
offered a correction to make it declare it the sense of the senate
that the death of an American on an unwarned merchantman
would be just cause for war.
It was said at the White House that the result In the senate
is satisfactory and It met with the wishes of the president. It was
added that attention will now be concentrated to the situation in
the house. Gpre voted to table his resolution. Chamberlain and
O'Gorman were the only Democrats who voted against the admin-
istration.
Senator Gore voted to table because he did ndt favor bis own
substitute and had introduced It merely to get an expression of the
senate on the issue.

INDIANAPOLIS, Mar. 3. That t In
state wide primary, to be. held In In
dlana March 7th Is going to be an ex
pensive proposition both lo taxpayers
and candidates for office Is the opin-
nn of political leaders of ull parties.
There Is much speculation as to what
It will cost the state and these esti
mates vary, but no estimate has been
lower than an average of $5,000
county. The lowest estimate, there
fore is $11)0,000 for the 92 counties of
he state. Some politicians think the
cost will run to $oo,000.
Marion county, In ' which Indiana
polis is situated, haa already appro
prlated $34,000 to pay the expenses of
the primary. Some county offl-mlsl
say this will not be enough. Some of
the smaller counties may not have
to spend, it Is estimated, mora t'miii
$3,000. But the larger counties like
Lake, Vigo, St. Joseph, Allen mid sn
(ierburg, and perhaps a few others
will, it Is believed, have to pay out
$15,000 or more. Until all the print
ing hills are in, however, it wilt not
be possible to' ascertain the cost of
the primary with any certain desro"
of accuracy.
That the primary is hitting the can
didates hard, there Is no qiie-tiion
Practically all of the political leaders
say that there was never any candl
date who made a canvass for ,n olfice,
to be nominated at a convention, that
ever spent any ways near what the
primary Is costing. The greatest Item
of expense, In the primary, Is for
newspaper advertising. The candi
dates are using this, method if appeal

TOKIO, Mar. 3. Prince Suml, the
infant son of the emperor, who was
born last December, paid his first
visit to his imperial parent yesterday.
With the sword of protection present
ed to him on his birth a little over
two months ago, the infant, borne In
the arms of a maid, was driven to the
lialnce with great pomp and cere
mony. The procession was formed of
several state carriages and was es
corted by mounted police sergeants.
Upon arrival at the palace the infant
prince was received by the princess
and princesses of the blood, officials
of the household and officials of blgh
rank.
A solemn ceremony was held be
fore Hie imperial chrines. The service
was Shintoist and was similar to
those performed during the consecra
tion of the emperor at Kioto In Novem
ber. Subsequently the child, his dress
being changed, was home Into the
apartments of his, father. He was
embraced by the mikado who showed
great pleasure that his boy had grown
so big and healthy and who proceeded
to ask many questions of the maids
in charge. In honor of the visit the
emperor made the prince a present
of fresh fish. This Is In fulfillment of
the Japanese customs of offering food
gifts both to the living and to the
spirits of the dead.
Officials of the Southern Pacific
lailroad In the state of Nevada are
making arrangement to have the
silver service set to be used on the
battleship Nevada taken to different
points along theline in order that
residents of the state might have a
chance to see it, says the Gazette.
E. O. McCormick, general manager
of the company, said that a special
car would be devoted to this purpose
should the people desire to see the
set made from silver and gold of the
Tonopah and GoldfleUl mines and
converted into a set by a legislative
appropriation. He made the offer
while in this city attending farmers
week and ofticials of the road ac
quiescing to the requests of people
have begun making arrangements to
send the set on a trip over the road.
One of the objections made to tak
ing the silver set from town to town
was thnt there was danger of break
ing the more fragile and costly pieces
In packing and repacking. W. D.
Forster, superintendent and traffic
manager of the Tonopah & Goldfield
railroad, disposed of this objection
by offering the use of his private
car, in which the exhibit eould be
made in each of the town, providing
arrangements could be made with the
railroads that would be traversed.
