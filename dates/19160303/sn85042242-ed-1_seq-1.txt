HEAVY GERMAN LOSSES
DENIED BY REPORTERS
Late Reports Credit Germany
With Immense Gains in Enemy
Territory.
'London, March 2—The British of­
ficial statement issued tonight on the
lighting in the western zone says:
"We recaptured the trenches at the
bluff of the Ypres-Comines canal,
which were lost February 14, and al­
so captured a small salient in the
German line."
The capture of S00 yards of British
positions, southeast of Ypres, after
.seavy artillery bombardments, was
claimed in the German official state­
ment of February 15, which added
that a majority of the defenders of
the British trenches were killed.
German attacks of great violence,
both artillery and infantry, have been
resumed to the north of Verdun. The
official statement issued by the
French war office tonight says that
furious infantry assaults have been
repulsed by the French troops,
"whose fire decimated the ranks of
the enemy."
Destroy Mine Galleries.
The German mine galleries in the
trenches were destroyed, the state­
ment says, and four officers and 17»
men were taken prisoners.
The situation remains unchanged
on t.he Russian and Austro-Italian
fronts. In lAsia the Russians are
keeping up their strong offensive
against the Turks.
Infantry Attacks.
While over most of the front, from
the east of the iMeuse down into the
Woevre region, the German big guns
have been active, around Douaumont
the Teutojjs launched several i.Qf?UV
try attacks of extreme violence.
These the French war office declares
were (nit down by the French troops.
Northeast of Miriel, the French
gnns have been worked effectively
against the German positions. In Al­
sace in the region of Seppois a heavy
artillery duel has been in. progress.
Big German Gains.
The Overseas News agency said to­
day
"Summarizing I he recent situation
on the western front, around Verdun,
correspondents at the front declare
that between February 21 and March
1 a total of 170 square kilometers of
territory was gained by the Germans,
Ihis being four times as much as the
French won in their entire offensive
in the Champagne last fall.
"The correspondents again empha­
size the fact that all the gains were
obtained by losses which were ap­
parently insignificant."
Helped Prisoners Escape.
The charge that a commanding of­
ficer of a guard had facilitated the
escape of German prisoners from the
prison camp at Amherst, N. S., was
made in the senate at Ottawa today,
by .Senator Clorin of Montreal. iHe
asked for documeents relative to the
escape and the courtmartial at Hali­
fax.
He added that he understood "the
officers who had allowed Germans to
escape were in the penitentiary or in
their graves.
The government allowed the adop
tion of the motion for the production
of the papers.
British 'Marine Losses.
An official communication issued to­
night "concerning marine losses says:
"British wrecks reported to the
board of trade in February aggregat­
ed 69, involving a loss of 420 lives.
Included in the wrecks were 42 sea
ships of a total tonnage of 56,856.
"Ten of these steamers were sunk
by enemy warships, with a loss of 36
lives: live by mines, with a loss of 176
lives one by a mine or a submarine,
with 'the loss of eight lives, and one
by bombs from a Zeppelin, with the
loss of 13 lives.
"Of 27 sailing ships lost, six were
sunk by enemy warships."
German Note Forwarded.
The German memorandum on
armed merchantment, addressed to
the United States, was dispatched by­
way of London in the embassy pouch
leaving Berlin February 14. It was
presumably forwarded to the United
States on the steamer, California, on
February 10.
Floating Mine Field.
A Stockholm dispatch to the Morn­
ing Post says that, according to a
message from Kralfkrona, Sweden, a
whole mine field of several hundred
mines is drifting from the north, hav­
ing presumably been set adrift by
wind and ice. Explosions are occur­
ring hourly and navigation in the
neighborhood of the Swedish islands
is perilous.
NEW CHIEF ENGINEER.

chief engineer of the department of
the east, with headquarters at New

SAYS ONE ENEMY
SHIP COULD SINK
U. S. PACIFIC FLEET
Admiral Cameron McR. Winslow.
Admiral (^ameron McR. Winslow,
commander of the U. S. Pacific fleet,
told the house naval committee in
the hearings on preparedness that
one good warship could sink his en­
tire fleet without being materially
harmed. He said that even with all
the reserves called out the fleet
would be wholly inadequate to meet
any probable enemy in the Pacific.
GETS 30 YEARS FOR
State Transportation Agent I). .1.
M'cGillis yesterday brought Robert (i.
Sinclair of Stirum. X. 1)., to the peni­
tentiary here to begin his sentence of
0 years, for murder.
Wahpeton, N. D., March 2.—Robert
(!. Sinclair of Stirum, X. D., was sen­
tenced' to 30 years at hard labor in
the state penitentiary yesterday, by
Judge Allen, after pleading guilty to
the murder of his two-weeks-old
daughter. Sinclair assumed all blame
for the crime, declaring that Miss
Edith Johitsonr-tftfr'- th'ild,"
knew nothing about the murder until
after the arrest was made. .No ac­
tion has been taken in her case.
Confesses to Murder.
In his confession before States At­
torney Forbes Sinclair told, without
apparent emotion, how he had stran­
gled the infant, by tying a shoestring
around its neck, ramming a large
towel down its throat, and afterwards
stabbing her iu the head with a pair
of scissors. This was done while
the mother was temporarily absent
from the room. Before her return he
left with the body in a suitcase, de­
positing it iu the vault, of an out
house.
Deceives the Mother.
Prior to the murder he had secured
the consent of the baby's Another to
leave it on the doorstep of some
home in Wahpeton, as he was anx­
ious to cover up his relation with
her. When he returned to the hotel
he told Miss Johnson that, he had left
the child at the door of a good home
and that it would be sure to fall into
good hands. She was induced to be­
lieve this.
Story Leads to Arrest.
The perpetrator of this crime would
never have been detected but for an
article in a Fargo newspaper, telling
of the woman's attempt to dispose of
the child in Fargo. While in that
city, "Mrs. Arthur Olson," as she
called herself, told a pitiful story to
Superintendent lHall of the Children's
home, and later to Captain Buyer of
the Salvation Army, of how she had
lost her husband in. an accident the
day after the baby was born ancl that
she was without support for herself
and child. This story was found to
be untrue the next day.
Conductor Arouses Suspicion.
Leaving Fargo, she came to this
city with Sinclair, who had been with
her in Fargo, and they registered as
man and wife at a local hotel. It
was here the infanticide was com­
mitted. Leaving the hotel the day
following the murder, they carried a
bundle of papers wrapped up to look
like a baby and no suspicion was
aroused. Later in the day they were
recognized by the conductor on the
train on their way to Stirum and he
was surprised to find them without
a baby, as he had read the story of
the Fargo incident in the newspa­
per. ,He reported to the authorities
and an investigation resulted in the
arrest of Sinclair and the girl, and
the subsequent confession by the for­
mer.
CHARACTER WITNESSES
PRAISE MR. BRANDEIS
Washington, March 2.—Louis D.
Brandeis was described today by wit­
nesses in his behalf, in the senate in­
vestigations of his fitness to be a su­
preme court justice, as a public spir­
ited man of high character who had
incurred the enmity of powerful finan­
cial interests by advocating move­
ments to which those interests were
opposed
Three of those who appeared for
Mr. Brandeis testified that he had
been assailed only by men whose in­
terests he had attacked. Others,
without referring to Mr. Brandies'
opponents, said his reputation was
high, both as to ability and character.

BACHELORS SEEKING
COVER OF EXEMPTIONS
Baron Harris, a Big Farmer, Says: Fund for Farm Demonstration Is
Single Men Are Not Needed
on Farms.
London, March 2.—Keen disap­
pointment as to the results of re­
cruiting under the voluntary .scheme
proposed by him was expressed in
the house of lords today by the Earl
of Derby, former chief of the recruit­
ing service. The earl laid the chief
blame for the failure to achieve the
full results at which he had aimed
to the easy exemption of single men,
belonging to the starred trades—men
required for work necessitated by the
war, and agriculturists. He made an
emphatic pled to the government to
prevent, bachelors of military age
from evading military service by
transferring themselves to specializ­
ed occupations, and declaring that a
strong effort was necessary to obtain
a requisite of fighting men, without
whom the Empire might, fall.
Agriculturists, the Earl of Derby
said, were the principal class to avail
themselves of exemption under the
plea that they were indispensable for
the production of foodstuff and that,
such exemption should be watched.
Baron Harris, who has large farm
interests, expressed the opinion that
no single man was necessary on a
farm.
The government, promises to revise
the list of reserve trades with a view
to releasing more men for the army.

N'ew York, March 2.—"Quarantine
the war fever," said Henry :Morgen
thau, ambassador to Turkey, now
home on leave of absence, in an ad­
dress today before the Merchants' as­
sociation of New York.
"There is one thing I want to bring
home to you," said Mr. Morgenthau,
"in this country we take active steps
to prevent yellow fever and other in­
fectious diseases from spreading. We
keep them out, but this war fever
that is traveling in Europe is one
thing that we are in danger of being
infected with. We ought to do the
same with respect to that fever as
we have done against other infec­
tious diseases. We ought, to inocu­
late ourselves with the serum of san­
ity and sobriety."

WHEAT RUSTS WILL
BE GIVEN ATTENTION
Carried in Proposed Agricul­
tural Bill.
Washington, March 2.—North Da­
kota wheat raisers will benefit: by in­
creased appropriations carried in the
agricultural appropriation bill which
will be reported to the house within
a few days. The bill carries special
items of $
10,000 for an investigation

controlling and eradicating them.
Farm Demonstration.
A total of $325,000 is provided for
the control of hog cholera, serums
and viruses and for demonstration of
methods of control and eradication of
hog cheolera. An increase of $100,000
is made in the appropriation for farm
demonstration, to be applied in the
north to educating the boys in hog
cholera and girls in canning, and also
demonstrating domestic science on
farms. Five thousand dollars is pro­
vided for the maintenance of Scully
Hill park in North Dakota.
Fight Develops.
A fight to eliminate the special ap­
propriation for the eradication of the
cotton boll weevil, and to consolidate
that and other appropriations under

made. The committee refused to do
this, however, for fear of a fight by
the southern members when the bill
reached the house.

No Hysteria
in Paris
Jamestown, X. I)., iMarch 2.—A
picture of Paris as it. appears to the
American traveler today is drawn by
Charles Boise, a former Jamestown
resident, in a letter to his father, W.
iE. Boise, of this city.
The spectacular is missing—but
Paris presents a remarkable saudy,
says Mr. iBoise, who is en route home
from the diamond fields of Africa.
"The spectacular side of life here
is subdued, now that the nation is
engaged in such serious business, and
one obtains a glimpse of the real
France which was a little known in
the pre-war days," writes Mr. Boise.
"There is not hysteria here, but every­
one goes about the day's work with a
calm and cheerful attitude sustained
by a deep confidence in the final out­
come. Even in such serious times.
'France has time to be courteous to
strangers, and we have met with sym­
pathetic consideration everywhere.
"One encounters soldiers every­
where, and they are all remarkably
well equipped. Most of those we see
are home on furloughs, or have been
recovering from wounds. I presume
we see none of the real badly wound­
ed on the streets, though some of the
scarred faces one notes gives an idea
of what, horrible mangling is going
on at the front."

to nine miles, or 1(1,000 to IS,000

Senator Gore Reports President as Say­

SENATOR STONE, DEMOCRATIC
LEADER, OPPOSES EXECUTIVE
2—
Out ol' a day's developments in Pres­
ident, Wilson's %lit with congress, crowded to the utmost with
elements oL' the sensational and dramatic, the administration forces
in the senate tonight emerged with pledges of enough, votes to Mil
once and for all, Senator (lore's resolution to warn Americans off
armed ships of 1 ho European belligerents, and demonstrates that
congress stands behind the president with his negotiations with
Germany.

Senator Stone Opposed.
will be followed promptly by stifling
opposition in the house against the
president's policy. In one of the
greatest nonpartisan debates the sen*
ate has heard in years, Chairman
Stone of the foreign relations com­
mittee declared he was not in accord
with the president. Senator Lodge,
the ranking Republican, pledged his
support to the president's determina­
tion to secure to Americans their
rights on the high seas, and Senator
John Sharp Williams, just from a
sick bed, delivered a withering denun­
ciation of the president's opponents.
The senate adjourned until tomor­
row at eleven o'clock, when the ad­
ministration leaders plan to bring up
llie Gore resolution, and table it, dis­
posing of it finally, as an embarrass­
ment to the president on his conduct
with the diplomatic negotiations with
Germany. They have found that not
more than twenty-three votes can be
mustered against them.
House Is Weakening.
In the house, where the president
was faced with further delay, the
promise of administration victory iu
the senate gave sfgps of ^breaking up
the opposition, and the leaders were
confident tonight' of similar action
there.
While the senate diebated, there
came news to the state department'
from Berlin which convinced officials
that' the dissention in congress was
being used deliberately to weaken
the President's hands in Germany.
Confidential advices state that re­
ports circulated in the German capi­
tal as having come from Washington,
declared that, congress stood five to
one against, the president.
Out of the senate debate came a
turn, which for the moment' threat­
ened to overshadow the real features
of the contest, and probably disclose
the basis for the agitation at the
capital.
Gore Tells Story.
Senator Gore, while the senate sat
wrapped in amazement, related a
story that President Wilson, at his
conference with congress leaders a
week ago, had declared that' Ger­
many's insistance on her position on
the submarine controversy probably
would result in a breach of diploma­
tic relations, that a breach probably
would be followed by war, and "that
a state of war might not of itself and
of necessity be an evil to this repub­
lic, but that the United States, by
entering upon war now, might be
able to bring it to a conclusion by
midsummer and thus render a great
service to civilization."
'Senator Gore claimed he did not
say the story was true, but that it
came to him with such a concurrence
of testimony and such marks of truth
that he did not feel that he could dis­
charge his duty as a senator and
withhold it.
Chairman Stone, of the foreign re­
lations committee, at once replied
that the president had never stated
to him or in his hearing that he be­
lieved, or in any way entertained the
thought that war between the United
States and Germany would be desir­
able, or would result in goOd to the
United States. When the White
House heard what Senator Gore said
this statement was iSBued:
Denies Statement.
"When the attention of the White
House was called to certain state­
ments in Senator Gore's speech this
afternoon, the president authorized
an unqualified denial of any utterance
to which any such meaning could be
attached."
It was explained on his behalf that
the president had told the congress
man that he could not predict what
would follow a breaking off of diplo
matic relations and had expressed in
the most vigorous terras his hope
that the United States would not be
drawn into war, and his .determina­
tion to continue to bend his every
effort to prevent it
It was denied that the president *,
had said anything to convey- the im
pression that he desired the United
States to enter the war to shorten It,
or for any other reason, bat he re
iterated the necessity of upholding
the national honor of the United
States at all costs.
