Mother Gone Home
Home is the central telephone
station from which radiates the
wires to ail stations on the lines
of love. Though ten thousand
miles separate the inmates no
power is strong enough to break
connection with "central."
Neither time, age. or death can
break its hold upon the human
heart. Home is the parent's
empire and childhood's paradise
on earth. To the inmateu of
Eden paradise was home, but to
all ages since home has been
paradise.
The home not founded and
fostered in the spirit of prayer
lacks that much of being ideal.
Ideal homos are God-guided.
We may forget our inventors,
our statesmen, cur warriors,
our philosophers and even our
preachers and live, but to for
get mo'.hcT and home is sure
death to both church and state.
Climate and fieographical lo
cation has no more to do with
vegetatim than has the atm'os
phere oT the home with the
voung cV.il'i's life. By far the
truDgc-tt aurcncy in the home
for thp l.velopment of a well
rounded viretrical character, is
Ihe Motber. "What is home
without mother?"
Two c f our citizens, W. I. and
John Luikart, left Tuesday after
noon for Alius Oklahoma, in re
sponse to a telegram announcing
Ihe serious illness of their
mother. At 7:"0 p. m. that
evening, and before the boys
her boys could rearh her. toe
? pint "f this saintly woman took
us iiign? to the home over
there." if tin's mother had dont
no in're than give to the world
two such splf ndid men as W. I
Luikatt and John Luikart. her
life wmild not have been spent
in vaiif.
The News extends condolence
to the breaved ones in this dark
hour.
Little Mary Mason Dead
Mary Mason, the four year old
laughter of Mr. and Mrs. F. K.
mason, dial bunday evening
about 7 o'clock, after only a few
hours illnesK, with acute indi
gestion. She became ill about
four o'clock, later had convul
sions and did not regain consci
ousness before passing away.
Little Mary was a beautiful
child, with a lovable disposition,
and natuarally made her own
friends w here ver she went. The
numerous floral tributes testified
to the love in which the little
girl was held, and the esteem
for hr family.
Funeral services were con
ducted at the family residence,
by Rev. Recce, pastor of the
Bapliet church, interment was
made at 10 o'clock Monday morn
ing at Ciovis cemetary. Magic
City Undertakers having charge.
Besides her parents she leaves
her brother Howard and sister
Helen to mourn her early de
mise. "This lovely bud. so young, so
fair
Called hence, by early doom
Juit came to show how sweet a
flower,
In Paradise would bloom."
Banks Up-to-Date
The First National Bank, in
keeping with its record of up-to-dateness,
has installed a Bur
roughs bookkeeping machine.
This the Ciovis National Bank
had already done. Just one
more illustration that the Ciovis
banks are abreast of the times
nnd are keeping pace with the
growth of our city and country.
Some on Figures
We once heard of a colored
youth who was an exceptionally
bright mathematician. It is said
that he had "figerd" clear thru
multip'ication, addition, subtree
tion, division, creation and abom
ination. That youth didn't have one M.
J. Carr, of Santa Fe, bested much
we opine. Mr. Carr paid the
News office a visit Wednesday,
and after paying his respects to
the gentle sighing zephyrs which
have been fanning our cheeks,
and incidently pitching a wee bit
of sand prcmiscously around, for
a few days, told us "prezaetly"
how many million of miles the
wind has blown the past twenty
four hours, how many tons of
snnd it had lifted, how many
farms it had blown into kingdom
come, and exact hour at which
the wind begins here in Ciovis
each mornig.
That was not all this gentle
man of Santa Fe said. This is
the other thing: "You have a
livtly little city here. It will be
the second or third city in the
State gome 'ay." Sure Mike, we
know it. Come to Ciovis.
Danger Signals
Red si;rnifn'8 danger. It may
get you out of trouble, or it may
pet you into trouble. That de
pends. Shake a red flag in the
face of a mad bull and you will
want to take to the timbers in
stanttr. Heed not the little red
fiags hanging on the ends of iron
rods atu'-k in the ground up and
down Ma;n Street, and you will
get into trouble. Pay these
(lags your kind respects, salute
them gently and swing around
to the right and you will keep
out of trouble. Better sit up and
take notice.
City Election
The City of Ciovis will hold an
election on April 4th. It is im
perative that the best men, w ho
will stand four square for the
b. Bt interests of our growing
town, be elected.
There is an abundance of good
material in Cloyis for every of-
fice that is to be filled and it is
hoped that no petty jeabusies
or cheap politics will enter into
this election. This is the time
when the entire citizenship of
Ciovis should unite. Will we do
it?
Ciovis Going "Wet"
Water may not be essential to
salvation, but it is quite essential
to a growing town like Ciovis.
Yes water and lots of it, hence
the city dads have let the con
tract for another well. When
this well is completed Ciovis will
have an ample supply of the
choicest liquid in the world.
After all Ciovis don't seem to be
going "dry."

(Bv A. F,
Since the question of prepared
ness is paramount in the minds
of the people at the present
time and will doubtless become
une of the main usues in tne
coming presidential campaign,
various writers of nation wide
prominence having discussed it
from every angle. That the
nation is at the present time in
adequately prepared tur war is
conceded by all wlw are familiar

Whatever plan islinaliy a dopted,
it is certain that our delenses

made great strides the oilier
day when the house military
commitee reached an agreement
on the outline ot toe army bill
which is a compromise framed
by Chairman Hay and advocated
by Secretary Garrison and Presi
dent Wilson. By tins new ar
rangement the eacu ttrentn
of the nation will be p.ucei at

lederatit n of the national guard
will be substituted for the con

pleasure of hearing the pastor
of the First Methodist Church in
Albuquerque discuss the ques
tion of preparedness from the
pulpit and in which he advocated
a greater patriotism and tne
greater unity of the American
people as the first line of defense
and the REAL preparedness.
In this we most heartily concur.
He said that the armor plate
people and the munition makers
were in favor of preparedness
(president Wood row Wilson's
statement that they were in no
wise effecting the sediment of
the leaders, to the c ntrary not
withstanding), and just so long
as this element continued to
furnish the munition to nations
and to dictate the prices, that

wars and rumors of wars would
continue. As an example he
cited the well known fact that
just as sonn as government
ownership of munition plants
was advocated by party leaders
ana congressmen, the armor
plate manufactures announced
that in such an event, they
would raise the price of plate
$200.00 a ton. This increase
under present contracts and
those authorized would amount
to millions of dollars in excess
of the present prices.

selves, it will bj the) strongest
weapon of preparedness. Just
so long as the weak become
Weaker and the common people
ate oppressed by lack of proper
governmental protection, there
can be lutie patriotism and little
preparedness. When the origi
nal thirteen colonies went to war
with Great Britain for our lib
erty, tne colonies were wholly
unprepared and the latter had
made every preparation known
to wan are of tnose times.
When the Spanish-American war
broke out this country was whol
ly unprepared but fepain was
supposed to be on a of the best
prepared nations on the face ot
the globe. In buth instances we
won. We won because there
was a patriotism and a determi
nation behind every move.
We agree with the eminent
pastor in believing that the tiist
line of preparedness should be
in the proper administration ot
our laws, the proper treatment
of the masses as well as the
classes, and the appeal to the
patriotic sentiment of th people
and then, and not until tnen,
will we establish unity which is
the first line of defense.

600 Head Hereford Cows
It is doubtful if the demand
for real good cattle was ever
stronger in this country than it
is at this present time. The sure
and safe route to success in this
great and growing country is the
live stock route, especially is
this true ir high grade cattle is
handled.
More and more our people are
coming to realize the fact that
"scrub" cows do not pay. Con
sequently they are demanding
better stuff, and this part of the
country is being stocked with
high grade cattle, the money
making sort. True it costs a bit
more to buy the high grade
cattle but there is positively no
comparison in the returns to the
owners of the "scru b" cow and
the well bred cow. It pays to
get the best regardless of the
difference in price.
This fact is patent, both to
the dealers and the buyer hence
we believe the dealers, of this
section are trying to get better
cattle for the buyers of this
section. The News appreciating
the vital worth of well bred
cattle to the small stock farmer
as vell as to the big cattle man,
is always pleased to make men
tion of tne good bunches of
cattle brought here. Six hun
dred head of young, high grade,
Hereford cows were shipped into
Farweil this week by Dunn &
Harrison.
Cheer Up
Say, my boy! Cheer up. This

all of its sprints arf cunsdered.
it pulls otf some queer stunts,
all too frequently for some
of us. tact is this old world
kind. likes to wallow a guy
in the mud it appears. But
had you noticed, that it never
fails to irive the clad hand to
the fellow who returns the com
pliment by pulling himself to
gether, and wallowing it in the
mud.
Cheer up, sonny. Get on the
sunnyside of the street. Shoot
at an eagle in the blue sky. It's
just as easy on your popgun as
to shoot at a bull frog in the
mud.
Wants More Land
J. S. Johnson, of the Havener
community, was a pleasant call
er at the News office Wednes
day. Mr. Johnson has been here
three years and he is so well
pleased that he is trying to get
more land.
This is the method of most all
those who have been in Curry
county for any length of time.
Perhaps nothing speaks better
for the country than this. Those
wno have been here long enough
to give Curry county a thorough
test out are so enthusiastic over
its future that they are buying
more land.
A real estate man said to the
News man the other day: "It
is almost impossible to get as
much as a section of land in a
body, aside from the railroad
land, the farmers of the
county are ouying up the land
adjoining them that can be
bought..
Eugene V. Debbs
The Socialists have secured
Hon. Eugene V. Debbs, one time
candidate for President on the
Socialist ticket and perhaps the
most noted Socialist in America
today, to speak in Ciovis Satur
day night April 15. The Elks
Auditorium has been secured for
the occasion.
More Than a Bank
There are banks that are just
bank?, and there are banks that
are banks plus. That is institu
tions that are not cold business
propositions, places to deposit
your money or borrow money,
but living, throbbing, friendly
institutions; Banks that feel a
vital, personal interest in the
welfare of every man, woman
and child. Every such institu
tion is a vital factor in the up
building of a community. Such
will be the Citizens' Bnnk. of
Ciovis, it is said,
In order that a bank may be
more than a bank, the head of
the institution must be more
than a banker. His spirit, ideas,
and ideals, must permeate,
saturate and control every move
ment of the institution. The
Citizens' Bank, it is said, will
have more than a banker at its
head, in the person of Mr. S. A.
Jones. True he is a bunker of
more than fourteen years ex
perience, filling the responsible
position of Cashior of a strong
bank in Kentucky when he was
but twenty years old. He came
to Curry county in 1907, and was
in the banking business in Mel
ruse for six years. Selling his
interests there he came to Ciovis
and assumed active charge of
The First National Bank in 1913.
Some months ago he sold his in
terests in the above mentioned
bank and organized the Citizens'
Bank. Mr. Jones' business life
in Curry county, as well as in
Kentucky, is an open book. He
tatves a keen interest in the wel
fare of man. He is a friend to
man, therefore the bank, of
which he is the active head, will
be a friend to man. Hence it is
a bank that is more .than a bank.
The Citizens' Bank is the
youngest banking institution in
the country, yet one of the
strongest, as Mr. Jones has as-t
sociated about fifteen of the
leadieg citizens in Ciovis and
Curry county with him. Among
these are some of the wealthiest
men in the State. It is said:
"That the Citizens Bank will be
as strong as the strongest, and
its policy will be a strictly friend
ly one, and a safe business one."
Get the Best
Wilcoxen, of Portales,
I.
J.
was a business visitor to Ciovis
Monday. Mr. Wilcoxen has
been in the cattle business at
Portales for a number of years
and has learned from actual ex
perience that it pays to have the
best. He said to the News man:
"I have recently received from
Waterloo Iowa, a fine registered
Holstein male. I am making a
specialty of this grade of cattle,
and It hey are certainly showing
up tine in this country."
Editor Likes Ciovis
Editor J. C. Wells, of the
Headley Informer, was here the
later part of last week and made
this otlice a pleasant call.
Editor Wells said: "Ciovis and
the Ciovis country looks awfully
good to me, so much so that i
am trying to make a deal for
some more of this good land
to add to what I already own
here."
