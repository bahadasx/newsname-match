CLASSES ALL LAND AS
"MINERAL" DESPITE RULING
Austin, Texas, Marcli 3. By the ac
tion of land commissioner J. T Bobtson
in classifying as "mineral" the 1,000,
000 acres of public school land which
comes on the market on Mny 1, he has
prevented the purchaser from acquiring
any title to an;- mincial that may now
be on the land or that hereafter be
discovered thereon This action is in
line with the contention of the land
commissioner that purchasers of school
lands do not acquire the right to the
minerals, but Is contrary to court de
cisions as construed by attorney gen
eral Lconey. The attorney general
holds that under the present statute
under Which such lands are Sold, there
Is no mineral reservation. Commis

Says Constitutionalist Government is Making an Earn
est Effort to Give Mexico a Real Democracy and to
Restore Order and All That is Needed is For the
American People to Give Encouragement.
ANDRES G GARCIA, consul from
Mexico to :i Paso, in a statement
setting forth the principles and
aims of the constitutional cause, depre
cates the fostering of juntas and revo
lutionary movements in the United
States, to continue warring in Mexico,
and asks that the citizens of the United
States and the government place their
stamp of disapproval upon such acts by
persons hostile to the constitutional
cause
"What is said along the border is re
flected throughout the United States,"
said Mr Garcia, "and if one-fourth of
the denouncements and aspersions that
are uttered were words of encourage
ment there would be K'ss occasion for
rejoicing over the formation of a 'hos-
( tile Junta,' and the intelligence that
economic conditions couia not be worse.
"In recognition of the Constitutional
government, the president of the United
States, acting forthe people of America,
gave to us that great moral strength
which is essential for a great nation to
bestow upon a lesser one in order that
the smaller nation mav survive. That
recognition was a splendid and coura
geous thing, but, unfortunately, it has
not been wholly bulwarked by the mor
al support and encouragement of the
American people Why? Because those
people, as a general rule, have been un
familiar with the vast and far reaching
political changes that had to occur be

Gen. Gavira Hears That the
Former Leader is Head

The last report from the Villa cam
paign In northern Chihuahua received
by Gen. Gabriel Oavira, whose troops
are guarding against a Villa feint to
the east, is that Villa and his army of
mounted men have withdrawn wholly
from the district of Guerrero, where he
has been active for the past several
months, and is now in the southern
Galeana district, apparently on his way
Into Sonora.
Scouts have informed the Constitu
tionalists that Villa has with him all of
his equipment and baggage and that
the move is one that would indicate that
he is moving because of the pressure
from the south and east. The Gavira
troops are not advancing Into the field
from the east, as thev are militia, and
are simply guarding off any break to
ward the east. The Herrera troops, un
der the command of Col. Cano, aro
mounted and moving toward the north
west, and It Is the pressure of this col
umn that Is responsible for the appar
ent withdrawal of Villa from Chihua
hua state, it is said

Whether Villa will enter the United
States through the Arizona line and lay
down his arms, or whether he will make
his nav into Sonora and keep up his
campaign, is problematic He Is caid
to have told people In and about Casas

provoke intervention on the part of the
