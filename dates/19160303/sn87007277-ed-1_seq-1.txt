RUSSIAN MOVABLE SHIELD TAKEN BY GERMANS

GREAT MOGULS OF ORGANIZED BASEBALL

This movable armor-protected shield, behind which a squad of men could find shelter while pumping a rain of
shells Into the enemy, Is one of many being used by the Germans. It is the invention of the Russians, who made
use of it when the Germans were laying
with six wheels. Two horses are harnessed to it in order to bring it into
ACES MANY PERILS
xerman Youth, Fleeing War, Has
Exciting Time.
dalbert Krause Reaches Texas After
Escaping Death at Sea and In
Mexico Gets $3 for Bala of
i Villa Money.
Fort Worth, Tex. When Adalbert
(rause, eighteen years old, a Ger-
an youth, left Berlin Just before the
start of the war, hoping to reach the
Jnlted States and thus escape mili
ary service, he little dreamed of the
exciting events he would experience
efore he attained his goal. '
Krause is Industrially, not militarily,
aclined, but before reaching this coun
try he faced starvation, was pursued
by German officers, was beaten by
allors, nearly shipwrecked, escaped
rom a ship at Tampico and was at-
acked and robbed by Mexicans. But
rause never lost hope and finally
reached El Paso, a town he never
nad heard of In Germany, and only
few days ago arrived in Fort Worth,
vhere he wants to become a captain
ft industry and a naturalized Ameri
can citizen.
When krause left his home in Ber
lin he first went to Hamburg, where
ke played hide and seek with the po
lice and other officers and between
limes tried to get work. Despite rigid
kconomy Krause soon was reduced to
bight cents, and he was getting des
perate when be obtained a position
M mess boy on board a Hamburg-
American line vessel. This ship first
took him to Spanish ports and later
0 Tampico, Mex. On the way the
ressel encountered severe storms and
the crew prepared to abandon the
Ihip. Krause thought his end had
ome, but the ship weathered the
ale.- Then the seamen began to treat
ause roughly, sometimes beating
kirn.
One night, when the vessel was at
famplco, Krausa bade farewell to the
alp. He could speak no Spanish, and
aving little funds he met difficulties
therever he turned. Finally he got
ork at San Luis Potosi in an oil
llant, where he could not understand
lie Indifferent and lazy customs of the
texlcan laborers.
Qnce he went to learn why som
ons failed to bring him water for his
oiler from a nearby river.
He found the peons sitting on the

siege to the Russian fortress at Grodnow. The apparatus Is equipped
leisurely Mexican style. The sight
stirred his Teutonic blood and there
was a fight. Krause fought with his
fists, and being lithe and muscular was
getting the better of the argument
when other peons ran up with drawn
knives.
Krause fled to his engine house, the
Mexicans in pursuit When he bolted
the door they tried to break it down.
Krause poked a revolver out of a win
dow and threatened to fire it they did
not "rausmit," which the peons did.
But San Luis Potosi Is far from the
United States, and so Krause began to
work his way toward Juarez, a dan
gerous, difficult trip. Part of the way
Krause went on horseback, but a sol
dier took the animal from him and he
traveled the rest of the distance on
foot
The German youth was delighted
when he arrived at Juarez with 150
pesos in Villa currency. This made a
big, eye-pleasing wad, and Krause
dreamed of the fortune he would start
with it He crossed to El Paso and ex
changed it for $3 in American money,
which quite took his breath away.
BIG GAME IS SLAUGHTERED
Wolves Are. Causing Great Havoo
Among Deer In the North
ern Woods.
Duluth, Minn. Trappers arriving
here with wolf hides for bounty report
that hundreds of northern Minnesota
deer are being slaughtered by wolves.
The exceptionally deep snow and the
alternate freezing and thawing have
made a crust that will sustain the
weight of the wolves, but the sharp
hoofs of deer break through, and they
fall an easy prey.
The scarcity of rabbits, which have
been wiped out, has made the deer the
only food available for wolves, and
even the small brush wolves have as
sembled in packs and become brave
enough through hunger to attack
young deer.

pow-wowlng a friend greeted an or
ganized baseball owner and said:
"What's the idea of this peace? You
got 'em licked, haven't you? They
lost money last year and they'll lose
more next year. Why don't you make
'em give up?"
The magnate puffed and sent the
smoke to the celling; his eyes moved
and finally his lips turned out:
"Yes, but what are you going to do
when this Gilmore signs up a new
'angel' every year? We thought we
had 'em licked when Stlfel lost in St.
Louis; we thought we bad 'em licked
when Indianapolis gave up; we
thought we had 'em beaten when Kan
