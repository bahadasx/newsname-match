APPLE GROWERS OF
WENATCHEE VALLEY
Will Meet Government Representatives
in Effort to Solve Market
ing Problems
Mr. J. B. Adams left Monday even
ing for Wenatchee, where he will be
all wee* and will meet with C. E. Bas
sett, C. W. Moomaw, W. H. Ken and
Judge J. B. Burns, legal representa
tives of the agricultural department.
Mr. Adams has arranged for a series of
meetings with the fruit growers of the
county. In order to cover the district
two meetings will be held every day.
The Peshaitin meeting will be held
on Friday at 2 p. m.
Representatives of the federal de
partment of agriculture will endeavor,
in conjunction with the fruit growers,
to work out a plan whereby the market
ing end of the fruit batiness will get
on something akin to a business basis
and get out of the haphaziard way of
selling their apples. For one thing, a
great many of the grower* have decided
to Join the Growers League which, un
def the management of Mr. Adams the
past year, gave all its members very
satisfactory and prompt returns for all
their apples. Mr. Adams returned Sat
urday evening from a trip to the Oka
nogan country where he met with large
meetings of growers at Omak and Oka
nogan, all of whom, according to a re
port in the Okanogan Independent,
were highly pleased with last year's
marketing and wish to continue their
connection with the league.
The Growers Leaeue is composed of
units scattered thruout Chelan and
Okanogan counties and controlled ap
proximately one-fourth of the dis
trict's apple production. While a
number of apple growers disposed of
their crop advantageously who were not
members of the league, yet taken as a
whole the league received better prices
and got more prompt returns, which
means the money for their apples, than
did those who were not affiliated with
it. Quite naturally, as this fact was es
tablished, the benefits of league mem
bership became evident, which ac
counts for the recent movement on the
part of a large number of the more
prominent growers to in the future
act with the organization.
By the close of the week, after the
meetings of the growers with the repre
sentatives of the government agricultu
ral bureau shall have been held the
league method of marketing the apple
crop of the Wenatchee valley will be
still more popular. The cash method
of selling apples appeals very strongly
to all of them, and in the future con
signment of the fruit will be pratically
abandoned.

Hundred Years
Dr. A. G. McKeown, official govern

with the following record of the snow
precipitation for the past three winters.
The observations are taken at 6 p. m.

U. S. Naval Officer's Reply to
British Commander
The following naval incident is go
ing the rounds of the press:
To the Honorable, the Secretary of the
Navy:
Sir: —I have the honor to report
herewith an incident which occurred as
follows:
At 3:20 o'clock on the morning of
October 24, while under full steam for
Hampton Roads, we received a wire
less from the British warship Vancouver,
which was accompanied by a British
torpedo boat. The message inquired
as to our destination and full particu
lars of our complement. Our reply
was worded as follows:
"Why the hell should we give you
information. Can't you see our flag?"
Thereupon we were commanded to
halt, to which I replied by ordering all
decks stripped for action. Within fif
teen minutes from the time I was com
manded to halt, my decks were stripped
for action, my men wer: at their posts,
and without further action the English
proceeded on their way.
Hoping that I have acted wisely in
the fulfillment of my duty, I remain,
Yours obediently,
John Hood,

EUROPE WANTS URGE
AMOUNT AMERICAN LUMBER
Everything Points to Prosperity for the
Lumber Industy the Coming
Summer
Everything points to activity in the
lumber industry of Washington. As
this is the leading industry it will affect
all other industries of the state. The
problem that just now disturbs the
lumber men is the labor question.
There is no question but that there
will be a shortage of men. Already
this shortage is felt. A number of men
who have in the past worked in the
Leavenworth mills have had offers of
jobs elsewhere and not a few have
taken advantage of the offers of work
as the mills here will not begin to op
erate for several weeks. The following
dispatch appeared in the daily press a
few days ago and is only the begin
ning of what is believed to indicate a
constantly growing demand. It is not
alone the foreign demand which has
given the lumber business a cheerful
outlook. The home demand has al
ready given abundant evidence that
this demand will be larger than for
years past.
The Belgian government is in the
market for 9,000,000 feet of lumber,
according to reports received in Chi
cago. Of this amount 3,000,000 feet
will be in large hewn timbers. Orders
are to be placed on the market thru
the Belgian consul of New Orleans.
Rumors of large orders from Euro
pean governments form one of the
most interesting features of the lumber
market. One order is said to involve
41,000,600 feet, while another, still
open to competition in Canada and the
northwest, calls for 77,000.000 feet for
the construction of portable houses.
Squirrel Extermination
Now is the time to fight the trouble
some ground squirrel. Every farmer
of Eastern Washington is familiar with
the enormous loss caused by squirrels.
The habit of these animals of hiber
nating half the year reduces their dan
ger of natural destruction and they
thus increase relatively rapidly. Pro
fessor W. T. Shaw, of the Washington
Agricultural Experiment Station, has
been studying the ground squirrel of
the state for a half dozen years and has
accumulated a large amount of infor
mation in regard to the animals. The
experiment station has just published a
popular bulletin setting forth some of
the results of this work. The bulletin
describes briefly the life history and
habits of the squirrel; its time of hiber
nation; its diet; the plan of its dens,
runways, etc., together with detailed
and definite directions for exterminat
ing the animals.
Three methods of extermination are
given, namely, by means of carbon bi
sulphide, by means of poison food, and
by steel traps. Each of these meth
ods is discussed in detail and the bul
letin will be found especially valuable
tc farmers undertaking to combat the
squirrel.
The bulletin is illustrated with color
plates, enabling one to distinguish be
tween the different species of squirrels.
Illustrations of plans of the squirrels'
dens are also given, thus enabling one
to apply the methods of extermination
intelligently and economically. At
tention is called to the fact that early
in the spring is the most effective time
to combat these animals. Write to
Experiment Station, Pullman, Wash
ington, for Popular Bulletin No. 99.

[he Kid Band Conceit
The Kid Band is an aggregation ol
which this town is proud to boast, and
its entertainments are generously patron
ized by the denizens of this town. At
the Monday night concert the Scenic
theatre was packed with an apprecia
tive audience. Between the band
numbers were sandwiched vocal and
instrumental solos, all of which were
encored. Among the soloists were
Mrs. Lou Brender, "Laddie;'' Mr. C.
W. Reed, "Oh, Promise Me;" Mrs.
Gritzmacher, "Songs My Mother Used
to Sing." Master Buddy Ault, the
eight year old alto horn soloist was the
hit of the evening. The kid, not
much larger than his horn, is very
clever. Much of the success of the
concert, as well as the band, is due to
the indefatigueable energy and persis
tence of Bandmaster McDaniel, who
has for years devoted his time to teach
ing the boys.
Fred Hudson Has Both Legs
Crushed
Last Friday afternoon Fred Hudson,
working with the ice packing gang at
the east end railroad ice house, was
helping to spot some cars, and at
tempted to stop three cars with a piece
of wood. The car left the track and
before he could get out of the way the
wheels passed over both his legs,
breaking one near the ankle joint and
the other between the knee and ankle.
The man was rushed to the Leaven
worth hospital and attended by Dr.
Hoxsey. The Doctor says he has
hopes of saving both legs. He suf
fered intense pain until after the frac
tures were reduced. Since then he is
resting better and as yet there are no
indications that amputation of either
leg will be necessary.
Yesterday the patient was so greatly
advanced toward recovery that Dr.
Hoxsey believed the stitches, of wljioh
there were more than seventy, could,
be safely removed. This is one of the
most remarkable surgical operations
in all the annals of railway accidents
and a complete cure will add much to
the doctor's already enviable reputation,
as a surgeon.
