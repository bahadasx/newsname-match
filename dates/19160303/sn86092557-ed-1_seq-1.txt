BOOTLEGGERS UNION
GETS AN AWFUL SHOCK
Internal Revenue Officers Reported in Our Midst And
Fairmont Actually Goes Dry.
For the first time since the Yost
law went into effect?and that Is a long
time, all things considered?there was
an actual dearth of liquor In Fairmont
this week.
Gentlemen who have never found it
difficult to satisfy their own appetites
and occasionally even have a little
with which to brighten the corner oc
cupied by some of their friends, went
around with their tongues hanging out,
figuratively speaking, and confessed
that It actually was Impossible to buy
a drop of liquor ot any quality in the
county.
"Why," said one of these deservedly
popular fellows, who shall be nameless
here, "you can't even get close enough
to a bootlegger to open negotiations
for a supply or joy water. If what I
am told Is true most of them are hid
ing under their beds and those who no
venture out wear such a look of pain
and apprehension that it goes right
to my sympathetic heart. Some of these
boys have been very nice to me during
the past year or so and I hate to see
them suffer so."
Tills does not overstate the situa
tion a bit. The bootleggers' union
went out of business with even more
suddenness than did the old Marietta
hotel. The explanation 1 The word

M, P, Conference To
Go to Janesville
The General conference of the M. P.
church which was scheduled to have
been held here in May of this year,
has been changed and' 'will meet at
Zanesville, Ohio, beginning May i?.
The chango was made owing to the
persistent efforts of the churches of
Zanesville to get the conference, that
city having been trying for the con
ference meeting for throe years. The
local church had only asked for the
conference once anil It was at first
decided to hold it here. "However, on
strenuous objections from Zanesville,
the place of meeting was changed to
that city.
Working Away On
New Lighting System
All Great White Way city lights
which were to be placed on old poles,
have been put up by the Mononga
hela Valley Traction company em
ployees, who are at present engaged
in erecting poles at locations where
they do not exist. The force of pole
erectors and electricians Is now work
ing in the streets in the Third, Four
th and Fifth wards.
The lights on the old poles have all
been placed and In every case have
made great improvement in the con
ditions which exist at night In several
localities where tho old lamps have
held sway for some time.
A definite time for finishing the
work Is, according to the street com
missioner's office, out of the question
on account of the many unexpected ob
stacles which arise dally, in the work.
City Officials Home
From Pittsburgh
Mayor Anthony Bowen. and Street
Commissioner Albert Lehman return
ed home from Pittsburgh rlast night.
They were there for the purpose, of
attending the Good Roads congress.
They both met the county representa
tives in Pittsburgh, but did not^stay
until > the latter were to come home.
Both the Mayor and the street com
missioner enjoyed the trip and listen
ed to mapy fine lectures on the sub
ject of good roads, which seems to be
tho main topic of conversation among
municipalities and starts at .the pres
day evening or early Monday morn
ing. The visitors did not make much
noise, so the exact facts about their
comings and goings have not yet leak
ed out. But the effect was pronounc
ed.
It Is said that.when they arrived the
"Revenues" were well supplied with
facts. They knew just who they want
ed to see and Just how to reach them.
They had a lot of other evidence too
and when they mentioned what it con
sisted of and added that.lt would pre
vent complications if the man they
were talking to Just stopped up to the
captain's office and took out a fed
eral license to retail liquor the boot
legger usually saw the point.
Some of them decided that they were
going to go out of business, whilo oth
ers were in so deep, it is said, that
there was nothing for them to do but
buy Uncle Sam's nicely engraved cer
tificate. Others simply took a hur
ried Journey to other climes.
What the outcome of the little visit
of the revenue men will be remains to
be seen. The local liquor sleuths, who
are not so very good even at their
best, are flabbergasted over the affair.
In the meantime about the only way in
which to get liquor is to go down to
the Point and tote in the Yost law
maximum, which, by the way. makes
tile stufT cost almost as much as the
bootleggers charged and has the added
disadvantage of being an awful nuis
ance. But it's "within the law."

This story comes with the assurance

This would make use ot the Balti

which point a foyrSriile line would be
built to connect with the Coal and
