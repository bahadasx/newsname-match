DAILY AND MONTHLY BALANCES
To Senate Committee Handling the
Sisal Investigation.
Washington, March 2. Charges that
the International Harvester company
had attempted to prevent the Conti
nental and Commercial National Bank
of Chicago from lending money to help
finance the Mexican sisal crop were
followed tcday by placing in evidence
In the senate's sisal investigation a
statement of the company's daily bal
ances and monthly averages at the

The average balance for November,

Arthur Reynolds, vice president of the
bank, was $1,270,600. It was then,
Wexler charged, that Reynolds said
Cyrus H. McCormick, president of the
Harvester company, had threatened to
withdraw the company's business if
the bank gave aid to the sisal grow
ers. The next month, December. 191".,
the average balance was $798,300. In
January, 1916, it was $43,100.
A telegram reed into the record from
the harvester company denied that its
'account had been withdrawn from the
, bank and accounted for its reduction
'as follows:
"Last week in December, 1913, in
stitution mentioned offered to sell us
$479,000 ipar value our notes at two
and interest. AVe purchased them and
paid by check our account with the
same bank, thus reducing balance ap
proximately half million."

"You see.." went on Cleveland, "this
baby hasn't any regular mouth at all
and the doctors says that she might
not ever be able to eat regular food
and. chief, she has fits all the time
and my wife does nothing but cry all
the time, and she is sick. So I asked
the doctors to kill the baby, but they
would not because they said the police
wouldn't let them. So I come to ask
if you'd help me to do it all regu
lar." At Cleveland's desolate home the
city physician found the baby in con
vulsions and the mother inhysterics.
He instructed that both be taken to a
hospital. He said it would be im
