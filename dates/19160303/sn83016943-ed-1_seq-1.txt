NUMBER ,20-
BEACOM
Circuit Court
SECOND WEEK.
Court adjourned Wednesday after
noon after a very interesting session
of three days this week.
The case against Jim Richards, ac
cused of stealing or assisting in the
stealing of one of C. C. Higginbotham's
hogs, which has taken up many days
of the court's time this term and last,
was finished by the acquittal of the ac
cused. The case against his brother,
Tom Richards, was thereupon nol gross
ed. Cyrus Richards and Parks More
head, both of Winston county, were
convicted, Cyrus pleading guilty, and
were fined $100 and sent to jail for six
ty days each.
Another case that excited a great
deal of interest was the State against
Dad Murphey, who stood accused of
rape on the person of Tiny Richardson,
both colored. He was acquitted.
These cases afforded the lawyers in
" terested ample fields for oratory and
they took advantage of them. John
Dinsmore made his maiden effort at
jury speaking in one of them and justi
fied the high expections of his friends.
His side won. Hardin Brooks warmed
up in the same case and on the same
side and spoke with great force, and
fervor. Another speech that attract
ed much attention was Attorney Rich
ardson's defence of Jim Richards. Our
new District Attorney won many en
coniums from those about the court
by his fine'handling of the state's side
in the cases he tried. By the way,
Mr. Rencher who was recognized as one
of the most attractive speakers in the
legislature when he was a member, is
equally logical and forceful at the bar.
The following cases were passed on;
Minerva Scott vs. J. L. Wilkerson:
This cause having been submitted on
motion and affidavit for security for
cost, and having been considered,
it is ordered that said motion be
sustained and plaintiff' given 60 days
in which to make bond for cost accrued
and to accrue.

had introduced its testimony, a motion

Report of Grand Jury.
To the Honorable T. B, CAMOLL, Judge of Noxu
bee Circuit Court:
The grand jury of Noxubee county
for the February term, 1916, respect
fully reports to the court as follows:
We have sat 8 days, have summoned
198 witnesses and examined 153, and
returned into court 24 true bills. We
have spent considerable time in examin
ing into some petty crimes such as the
stealing of corn from the field and of
seed cotton and cotton seed and stock
killing, because these crimes are rife
in some sections of the county, and
though small in themselves, it is very
important to the welfare of the coun
ty that they, be stonned.
.VS find mat our
bfiml-tiger -sai is preva
lent and rife all over the county-es-pecially
in Macon, Shuqualak and the
prairies and practiced by both black
and white. We examined many wit
nftRRPfl and made a most thorough ef
fort to get evidence sufficient to find
true bills, but though, we were in many
instances convinced that witnesses be
fore us knew of facts establishing guilt.
we could make no headway in the face
of persistent perjury by the witnesses
before us.
We ask your Honor that the follow-
ing persons waiter iee wiiiiama,
Pomp Taylor. Pap Spann and Jordan
Carter be served with subpoenas and
put under bond to appear before the
next grand jury, and that the bonds be
made sufficient to insure their appear
ance then.
We have examined the books of the
county officers ana nna tnem neatiy
and correctly kept. We have examin
ed the court house, jail and county
borne and find them well kept. We
recommend that there be installed in
the lower floor of the jail a bath and
toilet, there being none in the jail ex
cept that upstairs for the prisoners.
The llooring in the kitchen and dining
room of the jail is rotting and must be
replaced; we recommend that the new
floor be of concrete. We were parti
cularly pleased with the condition of
affairs at tha county home. It IB as
neatly and cleanly kept as any private
home, and the inmates express great
satisfaction with their food and gener-w of
at treatment, nun luhuu.v.m
home is a credit to Noxubee. The sup
erintendent's house there needs paint
in badlv to Drevent decay. We rec
ommend that the jail grounds be fenced e car,
to prevent too easy communication oi,B but
prisoners with persons outside. Vhen
We thank your Honor lor your clear u ar-
and instructive charge to us, and the
district and county attorneys for their i Into
able assistance to us in the discharge sate.

Why Cotton Declln$.
If there be any doubt in the
minds of anybody as to what the
geoeral trade thinks is the chief
reason for the declining tendency
of cotton values, let them take a
little trouble and ask some ques
tions. More than half of the re
plies will be that it is fear that
the South is going to plant a big
acreage, thereby supplying a basis
for expecting the next crop to be
materially larger than the one of
1915-16. This feeling naturally
causes the spinners, who are en
joying one of the greatest seasons
of prosperity ever known, to be
slow about buying their raw ma
terial supplies, and thereby causes
the South to have little demand
for its large unsold stock. More
over, the prospect serves to defer
action that would more than like
ly help to relieve the export situa
tion and induce freer buying by
the exporter. In other words, it
all means that tne confidence in
another big crop only a few months
hence encourages continuation of
the policy of buying just as spar
ingly as possible, and the keeping
of the burden on the shoulders of
the South, when a little wisdom
and far sightedness might relieve
it of a great part of it.
The, South has the opportunity
to determine whether it will in
vite another period of low prices.
It is true that the bulk of the cot
ton now being carried has been
taken out of the hands of the pro-'
ducer, and is owned by the mer:
chant or middleman, but that does
not obviate the fact that it is cot
ton and must yet be bought by
the consumer. It will be just as
much for sale as if it were still in
the hands of the producer, and
will have just as much influence
on the market. For the produc
er to go ahead and disregard all
reason and try, to raise another
big crop will hurt the owner of
the remnant of the present f,n'
-4 .... . A- WW
oi course, . n : :v
nexcrop for sale. The price is
made by the supply available,
matters not in whose hands it is.
Although there is in the belt a
strong determination, no doubt,
to keep acreage clown ana to as
sure continued independence by
planting freely to fodder and food
crops, it is important to have oth
er sections know what is planned.
The speculator acts on what senti
ment is, ofttimes misreading ac
tual conditions, hence the import
ance of seeing that there is no
mistaking the intentions of the
Dlanter to plant for a moderate
crop. The time is near at hand
tor planting other crops, ana much
can be done in affecting sentiment
by energy of preparations in plant
ing oats, corn, potatoes, etc.
The decline in the price of cot
ton just on the eve of planting
time should act as a restraining
factor and draw attention to the
danger of over-planting. Also,
the slowness with which the rem
nant of the old crop is being mar
keted should help, and it will
prove a blessing in disguise if it
serves to prevent any inciease
whatever. Xews-Scimitar.
