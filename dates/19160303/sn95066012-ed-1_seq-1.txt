CLASH ENCOURAGING GERMANY
Reported From Berlin .That Dissen
sion la Being Used to Weaken
Wllaon'a Poaitlon.'
Washington, March 3. In the sen
ate today following one of the most
spectacular debates of many sessions
the resolution by Senator Gore warn
ing Americans to keep off from armed
ships of the Europen belligerents was
defeated by a vote of 6G to 16.
' Washington, March 2. Out of a
stirring day's developments in Presi
dent Wilson's fight with congress the
administration forces in the senate to
night emerged with pledges of enough
votes to kill Senator Gore's resolution
to warn Americans off armed ships of
the European belligerents and demon
strate that congress stands behind the
President in bis negotiations with
Germany.
, Action in the senate, it is believed,
will be followed promptly by stifling of
sentiment In the house against the
President's foreign policy.
While the senate sat amazed, Sena
tor Gore related a story that President
Wilson at his conference with con
gress leaders a week ago had declared
Germany's Insistence on its position
in the submarine controversy probably
would result in a breach of diplomatic
relations;' that a ' breach probably
would be followed by war; and that
"a state of war might not of itself and
of necessity be an evil to this republic,
but that the United States by entering
upon 'war now might be able to bring
It to a conclusion by midsummer and
thus perform a great Bervlce for civili
sation ' ' . 1 .

termination to secure to Americans
their rights on the high seas, and Sen
ator John Sharp Williams, just from a
sick bed, denounced the President's
opponents. ,
While the senate debated, there
came news to the state department
from Berlin which . convinced officials
that the, dissension In -i congress was
being uscd-dellberately to weaken the
President's hand in Germany. COnil--dential

VIOLENT OFFENSIVE RESUMED

Artillery
London, Mar. 3. The Germans hare
succeeded In capturing the village of
Douamont from the French and report
that they have made some progress
northeast of Verdun in their latest at
tempt to Invest the fortification.!
London, Mar. 3. German attacks
of great violence have been resumed
to the north of Verdun.
Following severe artillery fire along
the entire front, from west of tlie
Meuse to beyond Douamont. to the
eastward, several very strong assaults
were made in the latter region, accord
ing to the night bulletin of the French
war office.
These attacks, which Paris charac
terizes as pushed with extreme
violence, were repulsed by French in
fantry, whose fire, It Is stated, "de
cimated the enemy ranks." French ar
tillery also was active in the engage
ment. La ote du Poivre, to the west' of Dou
amont, and Le Mort Homme, lying
across the Meuse southeast of Porges,
likewise were targets of the German
guns. Bombardment of the latter
point and the principal crossings of
the river began last night with great
vigo?.
In the Woevre district, east of Ver
dun, little activity has been shown by
the Germans except in the vicinity of
Fresnes,' where, after a severe bom
bardment, an attack was mado on the
French positions only to be repulsed,

British Officials Claim They Have
Information Refuting Ambaaaa
dor Bernatorff a Statement
Washington, March 2. British - of
ficials are In possession- of evidence
which has caused them to prouoance
false the official memorandum in
which Germany sought to Justify the
torpedoing ot the White zStar liner
Arabic on Aug. 19, last. This memor
andum was sent to Secretary Lansing
by Count von Uernstorff, the. German
Ambassador, on Oct. 6 of last ; year.
In it Count Bernstorff said the Ger
man Government had received re
ports of Oberlleutenant Schneider, the
commander of the submarine which
sank the Arabic, as well as additional
affidavits from other members of the
submarine crew, to the effect that the
commander did not order the Arabic
sunk until he became convinced that
she was trying to ram the submarine.
British official sources now make
the unqualified statement that the sub
marine which sank the Arabic was the
TJ-27, commanded by Oberlleutenant
Schneider, as stated in the memoran
dum, but after the Arabic was' tor
pedoed a British naval patrol boat
overhauled the submarine and destroy
ed It.
At lease two members of the crew
of the U-27 were ' rescued both of
them mortally wounded and before
they died they admitted that it ! was
their boat which had torpedoed the
Arabic. Oberlleutenant Schnoider
went down with his submarine. Sub
sequently salvage operations result
ed Iu the recovery of pcrta of the U-27
wreckage, among these recovered
parts being boathooks and other gear,
whlchjbore the marking U-27".!These
exhibits are now in the possession of
the. .British Admiralty. , ri .'
The' facts In the possession of the
British - Admiralty have been :: kept
carefully guarded for months . waiting,
it Is asserted, the hoped-for admission
on, the part of the German Government
that the U-27- had been destroyed. . A
few. weeks ago that, admission was
forthcoming, according to official in
formation from London, in the shape
of an official request made to the Brit
ish Government, through Walter H.
Page, American Ambassador in Lon
don, for information as to whether or
not one Wilhelm Schulz, who was a
warrant machinist on the U-27, was a
prisoner of the British in England.

Permanent Construction.
Joint committees from the Benning
ton board of trade and from the Ben
nington County Improvement associa
tion have begun a campaign to carry
out the completion of the west end
road this coming spring, '
At a recent meeting of the commit
tees of which A. J. Cooper represents
the board of trade as chairman and
Dr. W. E. Putnam, the Improvement
association, a plan of operations was
agreed upon.
It has been estimated that the work
will cost in the vicinity of $18,000. J.
C. Colgate baa agreed to meet nearly
half of the expense, approximately
18000, and the committees are hoping
to obtain the balance . as follows:
The town of Bennington will be asked
to appropriate 12500 at the annual
meeting next Tuesday, the committee
has already begun to solicit subscrip
tions to raise a similar sum, making
15000 and It ia hoped that 5000 can
be obtained from the state highway
fund.
Because there is.no gravel in the
vicinity of the proposed new highway
it is necessary to construct an expen
sive type of road. It will undoubtedly
be, the committees say, the most ex
pensive piece of construction in the
town outside of the corporation limita.
Because of the cost ot the proposed
improvement it has been put off from
year to year in spite of Its Importance.
A macadam road baa already been
built to tbe railroad track and the
New York state highway department,
