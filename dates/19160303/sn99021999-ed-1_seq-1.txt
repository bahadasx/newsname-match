EXCITING TIME ON THE FLOOR
WASHINGTON, March J. The
following statement was issued to
day at the White House:
"When the attention of the White
House was called to certain state
ments in Senator Gore's speech this
afternoon the president authorised
an unqualified denial of any utter
ance to which any such a meaning
could be attached."
President Wilson at conferences
with congress leaders today is un
derstood to have said that following
out the notes of the United States
government diplomatic relations
might be broken off with a nation
causing the death of an American in
disregard of international law, and
that he had been informed breaking
off of diplomatic relations might pre
cipitate war.
Gore Pats Qaeatloa ftoaarely.
Senator Gore in hla speeoh declared that
at the proper time he would put squarely
before the aenate whether the sinking
of an armed merchant veasel by a sub-
marine would be considered sufficient
cause for war.
"I introduced my resolution because
I was apprehensive we wore heading to
ward war." he said. "My act was based
on a report which seemed to me to come
from the highest authority that certain
senators and members of the house In
a conference with the president received
from him the Intimation, if not the
declaration, that If Germany Insisted on
its position the United States would In
sist upon Its, and that this would re
sult probably in a breach of diplomatic
relations and breach of diplomatic re
lations would probably be followed by a
state of war, and that a state of war
might not be an evil, might not be un
grateful, might end the war by midsum
mer, and thus might render a great ser
vice to clvilltation. I cannot certiry to
the truth of the report. I tell the tale
as it wa'Uia to. me. n
externaT1 and Jriternar iars of truth
that I feared that it might be the truth.
"If the senator front Missouri, the chair,
man of the foreign relations committee.
wUl deny it. that will satisfy roe. U
the senator from Indiana says It is not
true, I will accept that."
"I do not know why the senator quoted
me," replied Senator Stone.
"I did not quote the aenator," responded
Senator Gore.
Dlsclalsaer by Stoae.
"Well, In fairness to the president"
said Senator Stone, . "I think I should
state that tha president never stated to
me nor stated In, my hearing that he
believed or In any way entertained the
thought that war between . the United
States and the central powers would be
desirable or would result In any good,
or would not be ungrateful."
"It Is well known that the president
hss a passion for peace" interjected Sen
ator Kern In a tone that Indicated flat
denial of Senator Gore's charge.
"I have no passion for peace," Senator
Gore responded. "I do not believe all
peace is honorable or that all war is
dishonorable, but I repeat that what I
heard of the reported conversation be
tween the president and the senator from
Missouri wsa believed to be founded on
fact because of the source from which
It came to me. I was convinced that there
must be some basis for tha report that
the president suggested to the senator
from Missouri that the United States

ment for defense purpose only .
WASHINGTON. March 2. Count Mac
chl Di Cellere, the Italian embassador,

to the American memorandum Is not

tion being presented, now, it wss said,
was a statement of the reasons which
had actuated Italy to arm Italian mer
