VOLUME XIV.
The big city dailies all over the
country announced on February
20 that the notorious internation
al spy, Ignatius T. H. Lincoln,
former member of the British
parliament who escaped from a
deputy United States marshal at
Brooklyn, N. Y. in January, had
acain been caucht bv officials of
the Department, of Justice and
landed in jail. .This has interest
to our readers because the man
who ran him to the dearth was
none other than our friend Special
Agent Lindsay S. Perkins of the
Department of Justice, a fact
which' has been attested by. let
ters from" the Bureau head in
Washington congratulating him
upon the' good work. The De
partment was particularly anx
ious to catch Lincoln ! because,
after his escape from the mar
shal, he. boldly announced,
through the newspapers, that he
proposed to remain in New York,
and,defied anyone to find him,
although the New York World
offered a reward of $250 for his
arrest. Mr. Perkins found the
man, and two other agents put
the irons on him, but, being em
ployees of the U.,S. Government,
they could take no reward. Our
friend writes that the official let
ters of thanks, " which heads of
government bureaus give out
only in extremely rare cases, is
worth more to him than the re
ward offered. We wish our friend
Perkins could devote one rf his
New York letters to telling how
he corrajled this notorious felbw,
for whom more than 10,000 police
and secret service men were seek
ing, but he says he cannot tell
any of the particulars of his
work. The New, York World of
Sunday had an interview with
him about it, representing what
the Department had to give out
on the subject. The federal offi
cers of New York and Brooklyn
thanked him and his fellow
agents for the capture of Lincoln,
and will give them a banquet in
the near future.
Mrs. Dr. Chas. Chambers Dead.
Mrs. Dr. Charlie Chambers commit
ted suieide by shooting herself in the
head with - a pistol early Tuesday
morning at her home near, Chamber's
' store. She was formerly Miss Lewell
Walker, an unusually charming cul-
tured young lady and one of the most
popular teachers - of the county.
While teaching in the Selmer (High
! School in December, 1914, she was
married to Dr. Charlie Chambers, a
prominent young physician of his sec
tion, and they had lived happily to-
. gether. It is reported that her health,
which was never, robust, was continu
ally declining. That probably induced
hei to employ the tragic means of
ending her life. Our sympathy goes
, out to her husband, mother and other
relatives and friends. v 1

0 LETTER;?
Editoix Independent:
From early childhood, led by think
ing and intelligent 'parents, I have
been interested in science, and dis
coveries in that Bomain have always
been attractive to me.
' My father had a wonderful knowl
edge of such things, and especially of
astronomy and geology, so that when
we came to Washington ' and moved
among the experts in those sciences,
they were astonished that a farmer
from Tennessee knew so much , a'boiit
such things. If the Scotch philosoph
er Thomas Dick had the right con
ception of the truth, my father is even
now, in another existence, following
up that pursuit of . knowledge which
he loved so well on this earth. ' Some
writers believe that after death here,
our souls will be transferred from one
bright phfhet to another, ever pro
moted to a higher and nobler exist
ence.' That is far" better than the
doctrine preached by one fanatic in
Washington (who it is well to know,
utterly failed in his calling) that our
own luminary, the Bun, is nothing
more nor less than' hell itself, kept
bright and hot by the burning of sin
ful souls. I prefer to believe that
God created nothing in vain; that He
is the embodiment of love, and life,
and that the doctrine of eternal pun
ishment at any place is the invention
of sinful man himself, for hi3 own pur
poses. .
The two most interesting instru
ments of science to me are the teles
cope and microscope.-
Who can look up into the heavens
on a clear winter night, to that vast
expanse ''studded with stars and un
utterably bright," as Shakeapere says,
and think of the mysteries of that
numberless host, as far back as the
Milky Way, itself composed of bril
liant suns, without having a feeling of
awe and reverence come over him; a
deep sense of the sublimity and pow
er of the Hand that made and keeps
them going? '
Science has proved to us that these
stars, except the few planets which
compose our own solar system, area!)
suns, some of them many times as
large as our ewn sun, which, itself, is
one million, four hundred thousand
times as large as the, earth. ' The
moon, which is 240,000 miles from us,
could revolve inside the sun if the lat
ter were hollow, and leave a space of
200,000 miles on each side of its, or
bit. It takes light eight minutes to
come from the sun to our earth, nine
ty three millions of miles. The nearest
star is so far away that light would
be about three years in making' the
trip, although it moves at the rate of
196,000 miles every second.- The
great sun Canopgs, the largest known,
has 134 timeg the diameter of our sun,
and is 50,000 times as bright. Its
mass would make two and a half mil
lions of our own little sun. It "out
shines all the other stars except Sir
its, the Dog Star, but Canopus is so
far away that it takes sixty-five years
for its light to come to us. It sends
out rays of red, green, orange and
purple. It is now seen as an evening
star after ten o'clock, south of the
the 32d parallel. It was worshipped
i.i ancient Egypt, and , wild tribes in
Africa still bow down to it. There
are hundreds of thousands of these
suns shown by ordinary telescopes,
and the number is immensely increas
ed when one looks through the greas
reflectors like that on Mount Wilson,
California. When Andrew Carnegie,
who donated the instrument, was al
lowed to look through it, he saw a
a spiral nebula, hundreds of. millions
of miles across, the raw material for
another sun and system of worlds. If
all ' these suns have worlds around
them, as is believed, the worlds are
utterly invisible to us, but their num
ber must be as the sands of the sea.
Simon Newcomb estimated that the
universe is so vast that a ray of light
would take 30,000 years to cross it;
that if the orbit of our fartherest
planet, Neptune, five thousand millions
of miles across, were represented by
a finger-ring, the universe would be
as large as the United States, But
what is outside of that?

is cold, but that it gives out rays
which become light and heat only
when they strike a solid substance
like our earth and the sixty-mile thick
envelope of air around us.' They ar
gue that some thousands of feet
above the earth it is very cold, even
in summer; also, that balloon voyagers
venturing far up into the sky, even at
midday, see only darkness overhead.
The sun itself is a mystery to' us. A
man who works around our house
here worships the sun instead of God,
for he says, it i3 the source of all life.
But I am not prepared to believe that
our sun is the author of all the est
of creation. A young lady of my ac
quaintance , was employed at the
Smithsonian Institution, measuring
the spots on the sun. Some of them
were forty thousand miles across, and
perhaps as deep. Although they were
dark, these spots were found to have
an indicated temperature of ten thous
and degrees, s They travel around the
sun at its equator, and make nicks in
its edge, showing that they are really
holes. Some of the" flames on the sun
measured iOO.OOO miles high.
The space between these stars and
suns is supposed to be at the absolute
zero of cold, which is estimated to be
about 420 degrees below zero, Fah
renheit. But the temperature of
some cf the sun3 as . shown by that
wonderful instrument, the pyrhelio
meter, is much greater than that of
our own luminary. Sirius is credited
with 20.000 degrees, Aldebaran with
45,000, and Lambda Tauri with
72,000 degrees, of heat. Siriua, the
dog-star, twenty-four times the size
of our sun, is by some believed to be
the center of the system of which our
sun is a part, and around which most
of the stars are revolving, and then
there is hint of a third center, around
which Sirius itself is revolving. Some
scientists claim that our sun and plan
ets, with many other bodies, are
following an elliptical path around
Sirius which in time will bring us so
close to that immense, hot body that
we will all scorch up and the earth be
heated so that the slate will be wiped
off and tverything gotten ready for
a entirely new creation here. But
things like that are so hazy that you
cannot have much faith in them.
Discovery will bring us new instru
ments, like the spectroscope which
tells us of what the stars are made.
Thus we know now that there is a
great deal ofodium in the sun, to
gether with much iron and nickel,
but no gold or silver; even the fixed
stars tell, by the decomposed light, of
what they are made, What stories

' "Almost as interesting, is the view
of the smaller side of creation through
the microscope. I have looked through

to swim with, and I have seen the'five
