CLIMBING HIM
Now Quoted at 13 1-2 Cents
and May Go Much Higher
Farmers May Use Field
Granaries.
A new record price for grain
bags with a prospect of still fur
ther advances is another result
of the European war, the quota
tions at the present time being
13J cents for wheat bags and
from 12 to 12J cents for oat bags.
'j ne purchases for the Pacific
coast will not exceed 60 per cent
of the demand and the prospect
for getting new shipments in for
the 1916 season are not encourag
ing.
The bags for the Pacific coast
come from Calcutta, India, and
t^e bulk of the production has
been purchased by England to be
u ied in the construction of forti
fications in the field, the bags
being used to hold earth in place.
The present Lewiston quotation
is from 6 to 8 cents higher than
the normal price but a few years
ago a general shortage resulted
in the price approaching the quo
tation now made. It is explained
that importations to reach the
Pacific coast in time for the 1916
season, must leave Calcutta
a
early as April by direct shipments
and the ships are not now avai -
able for such cargoes.
Under ordinary conditions, re
lief might be secured through the
construction of elevators to han
d e the grain in bulk but with the
uncertainty as to the per cent of
the 1916 crop to be handled to
the eastern markets, the con
struction of elevators is practic
ally out of the question. It is
explained that the construction
of elevators of sufficient capacity ,
to store the delivery at any of
the Lewiston country points is
entirely impractical and with an
uncertainty as to the way the
grain will move, there is little
likelihood of an extensive effort
being made to handle the 1916
crop in this manner.
The advices received here are
that the price of bags will proba
bly recede following the close of
the war until normal or even
prices below normal will prevail,
and the only hope that can be of
fered this season is that the
prices paid for the 1916 crop will
be sufficiently high to warrant
the additional investment neces
sary to secure the bags.
Reports received from Nezperce
are that the Farmers' union is
planning the construction of an
elevator at Nezperce and it is
probable a second elevator will
be instal'ei at llo or some point
between Ho and Nezperce. The
capacity of these elevators has
not been indicated but it is no;
presamed the farmers will at
tempt to provide sufficient ele
vator storage for all of the grain
handled by them.
The farmers have been negli
gent this seasön in the matter of
purchasing their bags, the esti
mate made yesterday being that
only a very small per cent of the
bags received have been con
tracted for by the farmers. In
past seasons the Farmers' unions
throughout eastern Washington
and central Idaho have contracted
extensively early in the year to
supply the demands of their mem
bers, but few contracts of this
class have been made this year,

Stock Losses Not Be SmalV
D. F. VanPool was in the city
Monday from his ranch over on
Snake river and dropped in for a
few minutes' chat. When asked
about the situation among the
stockmen across the river he said
that there had been some loss of
cattle since the snow left by the
weakened cattle getting out onto
the hill sides and rolling. This
loss is heaviest i m >ng those who
had but little feed during the se
vere winter and ranges from one
or two head to twenty-five and
thirty head in some instances.
Mr. VanPool only lost a few
young calves during the coldest
weather but said he lost several
head of fat cows last fall from
impaction, caused by the animals
eating too much dry "cheat"
grass while getting down to the
green grass underneath.
Mr. VanPool stated that the
heaviest loss to the stockmen as
a result of the severe winter
would be the short calf crop this
spring, a large percentage of the
cows having lost their calves from
the effects of the cold weather
and insufficient feed. Just how
great this loss would prove to be
is hard to estimate but it will be
materially more than the loss
from mature cattle in the herds.
Bit By A Mad Dog
Ole Johnson, the well known
stockman and rough rider from
across the Salmon, left Tuesday
morning for Portland to take
treatment at the Pasteur institute
for a bite from a supposed mad
dog. Johnson was at the James
Jackson home 'Monday morning
and while talking the dog slipped
up from behind and bit him se
verely in the right hand. As the
animal had bitten several head of
stock there was little doubt but
that it was afflicted with hydro
phobia and Mr. Johnson decided
13 take no chances and came on
tJ this place the same day, leav
ing the next morning for Port
land to take treatment. His
many friends here hope his in
jury will readily answer to treat
ment and that he may soon re
turn to his home and family.
Later. —Johnson's wound was
dressed here by Dr. Shinnick
and on reaching Lewiston he de
cided to go under the care of Dr.
Braddock and gave up the Port
land trip.

Mr. Creelman to Build
A. L. Creelman yesterday pur
chased from J. N. Jolly a fine
building site on the Boulevard at
the corner of fifth avenue, the
consideration being $1,200. The
property has a frontage of 50 feet
and a depth of 142 feet. The
purchase was made to provide a
residence site and the erection of
handsome residence building
will be commenced very early in
the spring.
Mr. Creelman was engaged in
the general mercantile business
at Cottonwood for many years
and still retains his interests in
the business conducted there.
He removed to Lewiston to es
tablish his home about two years
ago. The negotiations for the
purchase of the building site were
conducted by the Potvin-Farring
ton company.—Saturday's Trib

Ed. Stolz was attacked late
last week at his farm near Green
creek by an angry sow and was
knocked down and severely bit
ten before he managed to make
his escape from the pen. But
for the fact that he was wearing
heavy clothing his injuries might
have been serious. As it was he
was bruised quite badly about
the legs and was laid up for a
I couple of days as a result of the
I encounter.
Greencreek Farm Land
Brings Good Price
Anton S. Nuxoll was in town
Monday from Greencreek and al
most floored us with the an
nouncement that he had closed a
deal on Saturday for the sale of
his 360-acre farm at Greencreek
to Joseph Schmidt for $31,600, or
a price of $90 an acre for the
home place and $85 an acre for
the adjoining land. Mr. Nuxoll
retains all of the livestock and
farm machinery and will hold a
big sale on March 14th to dispose
of this property.
Mr. Nuxoll filed on his original
homestead some twenty years ago
and cultivated the first land be
tween Greencreek and Nezperce.
He was later married and reared
his family there and, we thought,
had become a permanent fixture
of that rich farming section. A
few years ago he added to his
original holdings by purchasing
the farm of John H. Nuxoll at
Greencreek, giving him one of
the best tracts of land in that lo
cality. Recently he has improved
his home place by the addition of
Little Girl Strays From Home
The little five-year old daugh
ter of John Collins who lives near
the Oxford mine, left home early
Tuesday with her dog and said
she was going hunting. Nothing
serious was thought of the little
girl's remarks, Mrs. Collins only
supposing that she was going out
to play as usual. She strayed
away into the woods and of course
was soon lost. When she failed
to return home and could not be
located, word was sent out and
the neighborhood joined in a
hunt. Just before night she was
found by a ranger, five miles
from home. The crusted snow
made it easy walking for her and
just thaw enough that her shoe
track could be found here and
there averted what might have
been a sad happening.—Weippe

Young Prairie Farmers
Secure Fine Holsteins
a
Camas prairie may not be an
ideal dairy country but the
monthly cream check is becoming
more and more appreciated by
the farmers just the same and
many of them are rapidly shap
ing their affairs to make the
cream check materially larger as
time passes, as is evidenced by
the fact that? several are getting
in better animals in the dairy
class in order to breed up their
herds onto a better paying basis.
Two of the younger generation
of farmers in this locality showed
their faith in the dairy industry
this week by securing fine Hol
stein bulls for use in their herds.
J. B. Luchtefeld, residing north
of town, secured a fine 3-year old
animal from Ben Baker of
Grangeville, and Leo Simon, of
the Greencreek section, got a
nice 18-months old male from the
Hickerson herd at the same place.
The animal secured by Mr.
Luchtefeld was evidently winter
ed on straw and looked very bad
but comes from one of the very
best families in the Holstein
class and, with the care the new
owner will give him, will develop
into a magnificent animal within
many modern conveniences, mak
ing it an especially desirable farm
home. A short time since, how
ever he decided other sections
might offer better opportunities
for accumulating wealth and of
fered his land for sale, with the
above result Mr. Nuxoll left
Tuesday morning for Montana to
look over parts of that state and
will take life easy for a year or
so, whether he decides to invest
there or not.
By the purchase of the above
farm Mr. Schmidt has brought
his holdings of farm land in the
Greencreek section up to a total
of 1340 acres, making him one of
the largest farmers in the coun
ty and, when one considers the
value of this land in its present
highly improved condition, con
stituting him one of the wealth
iest citizens of this the largest
county in the United States. No
further evidence is needed to
convince one of his supreme faith
in the superior value of Camas
prairie soil.
Two Tracts Are Sold
Lapwai, Feb. 24.—Two tracts
of Indian heirship land were sold
today at the agency office at a
sale conducted by Superintendent
Theodore Sharp. There were
thirteen tracts offered but ac
ceptable bids were received for
only two of the offerings.
A tract, consisting of 80 acres
of agricultural land located 10
miles northeast of Cottonwood,
was purchased by George M.
Reed, of Grangeville, for $5,004.
The appraised value of this land
was $4,800.
Roy Nail, a farmer of the
Grangeville section, purchased
80 acres located near Stites and
of which 67 acres are cultivated,
for $3,690. The appraised value
of this land was $3,500.
Bert Oliver was in town yes
terday from his farm east of
Ferdinand and stated that his
sale Tuesday turned out better
than he had expected and totaled
between $2700 and $2800. Some
of the livestock went rather cheap
but the machinery and small stuff
made up the loss and he is well
satisfied with results.
at
in
the next year. This bull is a
grandson of King Segis on the
sire's side and a great grandson
of King of the Pontiacs on the
dam's side and has several near
female relatives in the 25 and 35
poundsof butter class. His breed
ing is of the best and his intro
duction into the Luchtefeld herd
wilLb* of immeasurable value to
the owner within the next few
years.
The animal secured by Mr.
Simon is also of excellent breed
ing, its sire having originally
come from one of the best dairy
herds in New York state, and
undoubtedly has many great
producers back of it. Mr. Simon
placed an order the first of the
week for a silo and will go into
the dairy business to win in
future, making that industry a
valuable adjunct to general farm
ing.
We are glad to see such a pro
gressive spirit among our farm
ers and it is such steps as the
above that will return better than
interest on the investment to the
tillers of the soil when our farm
lands reach valves of $150 to $200
per acre.

Change Grave Creek Road
Highway District Comm ission
ers Ed. Blake and D. Romain
were in the city Monday from
Keuterville and were guest at the
commercial club luncheon where
they laid before the club a propo
sition of constructing a new road
up the hill from Rocky Canyon
and abandon the present road up
Grâve Creek canyon. Their pro
position was to start a new road
from some point in Rocky canyon
and run up a side canyon to a
junction with the present county
road at the B. H. Luchtefeld
place south of Keuterville, or to
angle around the top of
the hill and connect with the
present road near the John Vos
kuhler home. The contention
was that the present road up
Grave Creek canyoq can never
be made a good road without
changing it out of the creek bed
onto the side hill and this would
entail an enormous expense,
while the other road can be con
structed for a reasonable amount
and will serve all purposes much
better than the present one. The
roads proposed to be built lie in
the Keuterville district, but in
asmuch as a large part of the
territory to be served is tributary
to Cottonwood the commissioners
feel that the matter of the change
should be partially borne by this
place. A committee was appoint
ed to look over the proposed
route with the Keuterville high
way board and report at a later
date, when some more definite
action will be taken.
Bad Fire at Grangeville
A fire which started in some
unknown manner las t night in
the old Schwalbach flour mill at
Grangeville destroyed the mill
and the E. S. Sweet barn nearby
and burned several dwellings.
The heavy wind that was blow
ing made it impossible to fight
the flames, which had secured
great headway before being dis
covered. In the Sweet barn
twelve head of fine livestock were
burned, including two fine stal
lions and several resistered cattle,
and the hired man, who was
sleeping in the barn, had a nar
row escape. The flour mill was
owned by Isaac Zehner and was
recently fitted up with new ma
chinery at considerable expense.
The amount of the damage has
not yet been estimated but will
run quite high. It was fortunate
for Grangeville that the fire did
not start in the center of town,
as it would have swept every
thing in its path.
