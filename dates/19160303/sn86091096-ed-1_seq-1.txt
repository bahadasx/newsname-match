Kendrick Loses
Basketball Game
Grangeville Wins by Score
of 19 to 17
^The basketball game between the
( Hendrick High School and the
Grangeville High School resulted in
a victory for the visiting team. The
game was played in the high school
gymnasium and a fair crowd was in
attendance. While we have had
faster games this season, the fact
the score was nineteen to seventeen,
indicates that this one was close
enough to be intensely interesting.
Prof. Best refereed the game and
Mr. Cook, the Grangeville coach,
umpired. Their decisions gave
general satisfaction.
Grangeville's line up was as fol
lows: Halschow, Howard, Eimers,
Kabot, G. Eimers and Atwood,
substitute. Kendrick played Waltz,
Fenton, Davis, Meyers and Guy
during the first half and substituted
F. Meyers the last half. Grange
ville threw six field goals and seven
fouls and Kendrick threw five field
goals and seven fouls.
This will probably be the last
game of the season. Mr. McConou
ghy deserves a great deal of credit
for his untiring efforts in behalf of
the local boys. His consistent coach
ing has brought forth a marked
improvement in their team-work
«nd bias also developed some new
players who will no doubt be on the
team/pext year.

U. of O. Girls Flat Footed
Eugene, Ore., Feb. 28.—Prints
just taken in the physeial culture
department of the University of
Oregon of the feet of 23 second
semester freshman girls show that
but three have good feet and not
one a perfect toe line. These stu
dents are the first to undergo a new
test being tried out by the depart
ment to^determine the condition of
the feet of girls entering the uni
versity.
Most of the girls were found to
have flat feet, caused by wearing
high heels and pointed toes.
"When one wears high heels the
muscles of the arches and the mus
cles in the back part of the foot are
weakened and gradually the arch
breakes down, causing a flat foot,
as well as many physical "disorders"
said Miss Freida Goldsmith, physical
director, who has just completed
the first set of prints.
The method of taking pictures
of the feet is similar to taking the
thumb prints. The foot is printed
and an impression made on a card
The print is then painted with a
solution which makes the lines more
distinct.
In the future all freshmen wilfe
have footprints taken upon register
ing and defective foot classes will
be organized.
Remodels Home
Oldfield, the jeweler, will have
set a record for attractive homes
when the plans that he has almost
completed are entirely carried out.
Except for the painting of the ex
terior of the house, the remodeling
is about done; and he will move
v from his present location in the
•son Building to his new home
as soon as the weather conditions
permit.
The house has seven full rooms
and a bath with the additional
feature of a breakfast room, with
built-in furniture, on the east side
of the house. The living room of
the residence is 24 by 14 and is
now made attractive by the addition
of a fireplace and a bay-window
The outside of the house will be
finished in green with suitable
trimming.
Mr. Oldfield's lot is 100 by 100
feet and gives him plenty of room
for a summer garden and for shrubs
and flowers. On the west side of
the residence he plans to set out
apple and other fruit trees, the lot
toward the school being graded for
a lawn.
Mr. Carman, warehouse man of
Culdesac, was in town on business
Wednesday. He was here for the
purpose of having his building wired.
Mr. Roy Plummer left for Spok
ane Thursday te visit relatives for
a short time.
Fishing Licenses Now Ready
The 1916 fish and game licenses,
both resident and alien and non
resident, have reached Moscow from
the state game department, and will
shortly be distributed to various
parts of the county where they will
be available for those desiring to
purchase them.
Though the new licenses do not
become effective until April 1st this
will not preclude their purchase be
fore that date and will entitle the
holder to hunt and fish in accordance
with the provisions of the fish and
game laws of the state. Assistant
Chief Deputy Game Warden J. J.
Keane anticipates an unprecedented
sale of licenses in Latah county
during the present year. The sale
during the last year was above that
of the preceding year.
New Condition in
Grain Shipments
More Expensive but Quick
er Delivery
The daily shipments of grain
over the Palouse lines destined for
Atlantic terminals records a new
condition in the marketing of the
central Idaho crop and the report
made by dealers is that the bulk of
the remaining wheat crop will be
shipped out this way. At the pres
ent time the daily shipments
amount to from 10 to 15 carloads
and frequently helper engines are
required to move the loads up the
Kendrick hill.
It is explained by shippers that
two causes contribute to the move
ment of wheat by rail to the At
lantic seaboard and they are the
scarcity and high charter rates for
ships from Portland or Seattle and
the demand for quick deliveries to
Europe. The expense of market
ing by rail across the continent and
by steamers to Europe is consider
ably higher than by sailing vessel
from Portland or Seattle but less
than one-fourth of the number of
ships that would be required from
the Pacific, and the conditions in
Europe will not warrant any delay
because of a slight saving in trans
portation charges.
In the central Idaho and eastern
Washington sections it is estimated
that not more than 20 to 25 per
cent of the 1915 crop remains in
the hands of the growers and only
from 30 to 35 per cent of the crop
remains in the country. The move
ment of grain east and the move
ment of war munitions and supplies
has resulted in a car shortage and
for that reason the movement of
the central Idaho crop is consid
erably retarded. The car shortage
is responsible for keeping the
steamer Spokane out of service in
the movement of grain from the
river warehouses. Up to the pres
ent time the company has been able
to supply only a sufficient number
of cars for the grain handled by
in
_____ ^ ^ „j
the steamer Lewiston and the second j
steamer cannot be placed in corn
mission until the car situation
shows improvement.
The dealers in the Lewiston
country, however, are not especially
suffering from the car shortage
and this is due to the competion
between the Northern Pacific and
the O. W. R. & N. companies. The
bulk of the crop is delivered at
stations on the Camas Prairie line
and both companies are anxious for
tonnage at all these points. In the
event one company is unable to
supply cars when wanted, the other
company is in readiness to push the
required number of cars into the
siding and this condition has re
sulted in both companies keeping
prepared to furnish cars for any of
the competitive points. The Clear
water stations are benefited from
the competition on the Camas
Prairie line, as the Northern Paci
fic is able to spare a few cars for
Clearwater stations at almost any
tinte, but in the eastern Washington
section^ where the stations are de
pendent on one line of railroad the
shippers are finding considerable
trouble in getting cars when
needed.—Lewiston Tribune.

When you find the Common Sense Man you will
find one who lives simply, no matter what his finan
ces are. Every man who thinks he has the world by
the tail, and is about to snap its demnition head off
for the delectation of himself and immediate friends,
is unsafe, no matter how great his genius.
The Commonsense Man looks after just one in
dividual, and that is the man under his own derby ;
he does not spend money until he earns it; he pays
his way ; he knows that nothing is ever given for
nothing, he keeps his digits off other people's prop
erty. When he does not know what to say, he says
nothing ; and when he does not know what to do, he
does not do it. I should like to see a university de
voted to turning out safe men, instead of merely
clever ones—commonsense men, instead of learned
ones. —Elbert Hubbard.
Prices Climbing
The cost of living is going up.
Nearly everything is higher this
year than last and will probably go
still higher. Overalls have advanc
ed materially for the lack of domes
tic dyes. Most of our dyes were
imported from Germany. Practi
cally everything the printer needs
in his business has advanced—prin
cipally colored bond paper and
envelopes. Type has advanced
greatly owing to the higher prices
of nearly all kinds of metal, prin
cipally brass copper and zinc.
A new record price for grain
bags with a prospect of still further
advances is another result of the
European war, the quotations at the
present time being 12 1-2 cents for
wheat bags and from 12 to 12 1-2
cents for oat bags. The purchases
for the Pacific coast will not exceed
60 per cent of the demand and the
prospect for getting new shipments
in for the 1916 season are not en
couraging.
Buy Road Graders at Moscow
G.
The county commissioners closed
a contract with the Canton Colvert
and Silo company of Canton, Ohio,
for culvert tubing of galvanized
iron, ranging from eight to 42
inches in diameter, costing from
52 cents to $2.70 per foot. Other
contracts awarded were to the
General Machinery company of
Spokane for Little Giant graders at
$200 each, Holt Fresno scrapers at
$16.75 to $18.75 and Royal road
plows at $25.50; the Buffalo Steam
Roller company for a Square Deal
grader for $240; the Russell Grader
Manufacturing company, one Russell
j ** r j K ra( ^ er at $195, and the How
a rd-Cooper, one climax grader,
making four different kinds of
graders to be tried by the county
this year.
Organized Orchestra
The Kendrick Orchestra and
Thomas' Orchestra have united in
to one organization for the purpose
of concert work and to furnish
music for entertainments. They
held their first rehearsal Saturday
eveving in the Barnum Theatre and
will make their first public appear
ance at the third number of the
Lyceum course Friday evening.
This orchestra is the equal of any
in north Idaho and is a credit to
Kendrick. Following is a list of
the musicians and their instruments :
Mrs. Walter McCrea, piano; Walter
Thomas, leader, violin; Harold
Thomas, plccola; Glen Porter and
Dr. Hoyt, corhets; Adolph Wegner
and O. E. MacPherson, trombones;
G. G. Oldfield, cello; Bob Jones,
tuba; Stewart Compton, drums.
Those who miss the Lyceum
course will regret it for it promises
to be an entertainment of unusual
merit.
Mrs. Myrtle'Gross, who has been
visiting her sister, Mrs. E. Russell
of Pomeroy, arrived un the 9:05
train Thursday morning to visit
with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. J.
F. Brown of this city.
Sunday School Class Party
Last Thursday evening in the
Sunday School room of the Presby
terian church, Marvin Long gave a
party to his Sunday Schöol class.
He has a class of fourteen boys,
thirteen of the fourteen were pre
sent on this occasion. A boy's club
was organized which they named
the "Young Crusaders." Officers
were elected as follows:
President, Egnes Flaig.
Vice-president, Frank Florence
Treasurer, Charles Crocker.
Secretary, Robert Perkins.
The remainder of the evening
was spent in playing games. Dr.
G. H. Smith gave a very interesting
talk.
The boys must be credited for
acting as little gentlemen in every
respect.
Refreshments consisted of ham
sandwiches, wafers and hot choco
late, apples and candy, after which
all departed for their various homes
having had a splendid time.

Critic's Report
Band Minstrel Progressing
The music for the musical ex
travaganza to be staged by the
local talent for the benefit of the
local band has arrived straight
from Alabama. This was the only
state in the Union from which real
darkey jubilee numbers could be
secured and only the best of all
were chosen for presentation be
fore Kendrick critics. The actual
work of staging the Minstrels will
be begun in the very near future
and the date of its presentation
will be given in these columns as
soon as it is determined. When
the big night comes every able
bodied person in Kendrick and
tributary country will lay the cor
nerstone of a better town by com
ing to the support of the band or
ganization and showing their in
terest in the boys bv being present
in a .body. Do it, for a bigger,
better band!
After spending a few days at the
home of Edward Murphv, T. G.
McCormick returned to his home in
Spokane Thursday.
The members of the Kendrick
Sewing Club enjoyed a very plea
sant evening last Wednesday at the
home of Dr. and Mrs. J. E. Hoyt.
The occasion was a surprise upon
Miss Luella Hoyt, who is residing
in Troy at present.
Several delightful hours were
spent in sewing and conversation
after which delicious and appropai
ate refreshments were served. At
a late hour the guests reluctantly
departed wishing such enjoyable
events were more numerous.
Third Number
Lyceum Course
Interesting Program Assured
Friday, March 3
Sewing Club Entertained
The third number of the Lyceum
Course will be given in the Barnum
Theatre on Friday evening, March
third at eight-fifteen. A good pro
gram is assured. It will be divided
into four parts as follows:
Part 1. "Mother Goose," an
operetta by the first and second
grades.
Part 2. Indian drill by the third
and fourth grades.
Part 3. "A Mid Summer Eve,"
an operetta by the fifth, sixth,
seventh and eighth grades.
Part 4. "That Rascal Pat," a farce
by the high school.
There will be special music by a
male quartette and by the Kendrick
ten piece orchestra.
Much time has been spent by
those who have the entertainment
in charge to make it one of the best
numbers on the lecture course. By
attending Friday evening you will
help make it a success financially
and thus assure another course next
winter. Thus far the Lyceum
Course has been a great success and
the support it has received is evi
dence to the fact that the people of
Kendrick appreciate a good thing
when it comes along.

Owing to the market conditions
during the past week or two, the
Northern Pacific railroad has been
compelled to add several freight
crews to their line operating through
Kendrick in order to move the
large amount of wheat in transit.
As many as six trains of grain each
day for the past five days have been
routed through Kendrick from the
surrounding country but it is
thought that there will be a lull in
shipping as soon as recent changes
in the grain markets are felt in
this section. The demand for cars
for wheat shipments has been so
great that is has caused a car
shortage in the Northwest and some
sections feel the effects of curtailed
shipping facilities very keenly.

opportunity to hear the best or
chestral numbers ever heard in the
town. The music will be furnished
by a ten piece orchestra of local
musicians and the name of each of
them is a guarantee of good music,
well rendered. This same orchestra

Big Increase In
Creamery Products
Mr. Gibbons Gives Some
Encouraging Facts
The creamery has begun to feel
the effects of the coming spring
and the increase in the output of
butter has been noticeable during
the month of February. Mr. Gib
bon, the local butter expert, in
forms us that the amount of butter
turned out by the local creamery
for the past week exceeds that of
the previous weeks during the
winter by about fifty pounds, which
makes the average about seven
hundred pounds each week. He
predicts that, with the coming of
warm weather this spring and the
resultant green feed for the dairy
herds, the output of the plant will
average twelve hundred pounds
each week. The period during
which the production of milk is
greatest is between the months of
April and October, two months be
ing deducted from this period for
the expected dry weather.
In his estimation, the greatest
drawback in the way of dairy pro
gress in this section is the lack of
silos which are very necessary to
the proper operation of a modem
dairy in a country adapted to the
raising of wheat. Even with the
decreased production during the
cold winter months, the Kendrick
Creamery has paid money on the
investment; and, with the enlarged
herds which are being planned, it
will be one of the best little in
dustries in this vicinity.
Y. M. C. A. Contests
Laät i
ri%on,
fall at Salem and at Ontario,
boys from Oregon and Idaho attend
ed two Boys' Conferences which
were conducted under the direction
of the Oregon-Idaho Young Men's
Christian Association Executive
Committee. Now the Boys' Work
Department of that Committee
annonuces a big Cup Contest for
older boys and another for smaller
boys. Among those who are putt
ing forth cups in the older boys'
contests are Gov. James Withycombe
W. M. Lodd, Portland, Mayor H. R.
Albee, of Portland, Mr. A. C. Sch
mitt, of Albany and Pres. Melvin
A. Brannon of the University of
Idaho, Moscow, Idaho. While the
committee cannot announce the full
list of doners at this time they will
be able to very soon. The contests
are to be launched at once.
For older boys' clubs and classes
in Sunday Schools, High Schools,
Y. M. C. A. and other boys organi
zations contests include five lines
of endeavor, Bible Study, Agricul
ture, Membership Increase, Per
cent of Attendance, and Thrift.
Any club which can qualify may
enter any one or all of these five
contests, and as the committee has
tried to set up regulations that
will put all classes on an equal basis
the contest bids fair to be close
from the start on April 1st to the
close November 1st.
The younger boys, twelve to fif
teen years of age are to have an
equally attractive contest involving
tests Physical, Religious, and Edu
cational, which tests may be con
ducted by leaders for boys' groups
of various organizations. The cup
for this contest has been offered
jointly by Pres. U. K. Hall of the
Oregon Sunday School Association
and Pres. H. C. Baldridge of the
Idaho Sunday School Association.
No contests have probably ever
been organized with such a variety
of activities and including so tho
roughly all classes of boys organi
zations as these under the direction
of the State Y. M. C. A. Committee
for the boys of Oregon and Idaho.
Futher information may be had by
addressing John H. Rudd, Interstate
Boys' Secretary, 305 Y. M. C. A.,
Portland, Oregon, stating clearly in
which contests you are interested.
