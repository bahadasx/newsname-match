SOUTHWEST TRAIL BOOSTS
KANSAS
Wide publicity is being given the
agricultural advantages of Kansas
In the current issue of the Southwest
Trail, a monthly magazine published
Ty Rock Island Lines. An unusual
feature of the number is the em
phasis laid on the state's farm educa
tional facilities. Two pages are de
voted to Kansas State Agricultural
College and the various activities
through which that institution reach
es the farmer. This is considered by
the company one of the strong in
ducements for intending settlers, as
distinguished from the usual plan of
calling attention only to land buying
opportunities.
When a hoineseeker inquires about
a location in Rock Island territory
iu Kansas he is given crop statistics,
land information and climatic data,
but stress is laid, also, upon the fact
that Kansas excels in providing edu
cational facilities not only for young
people, but for the farmer on the
farm and for the intending settler.
This is in line with the company's
established policy in directing houie
seekers to localities providing proper
agricultural advice.
Many thousands of copies of this
issue of thu Southwest Trail will be
distributed by the Uoek Island in the
mortli and east, among those seeking
farms in the great wheat and corn
belt of Kansas.
CO.VNELLV JEWELRY STOKE
ROBBED
The Jewelry store of W. D. Connel
ly, which is located in the Wimnier
drug store building, was broken in
to some time Thursday night of last
week, and a haul of about $200
worth of Jewelry was taken by the
marauders. A small hole was
punched in the window iu the back
end of the store, through which the
window lock was released and the
lower window raised. The window
is protected by iron bars but the
party doing the job was evidently
small enough to squeeze between
them, as none of the bars were
wrenched loose. Exit was. made by
the back door which was protected
by a night lock and could be opened
from the Inside. The burglar had
undoubtedly made a careful survey
of the premises beforehand as the
Job was done in a thorough manner.
The sheriff and police force were im
mediately put on the trail and Sher
iff Dobson has notified the officers
of the surrounding towns and coun
ties to be on the lookout for an at
tempted sale of the jewerly.

WILL OPEN BRANCH AT BEAVER
M. Feinberg, who started in busi
ness in Liberal about a year ago, is
so well pleased with the prospects
of things around here that he is fig
uring on putting in a store at Beaver.
With the advent of the railroad into
Beaver the old town took such a
boom that scarcely a day passes that
some new enterprise isn't launched.
Here is what the Beaver Herald says
about Mr. Feinberg's contemplated
project:
"M. Feinberg. of Liberal, Kansas,
was here the past week and closed
a lease for the Long & Lawson brick,
which will be constructed at once.
Mr. Feinberg is connected with a
chain of stores having establish
ments at Wichita, Medicine Lodge
and Liberal, Kansas, and it is his in
tention to put in an up-to-date estab
lishment here. His line will be
men's, women's and children's furn
ishings. He left Sunday for the
I New York markets to buy spring
! stock for the establishments and
I while there ho will buy a stock of
I goods and fixtures for the Beaver
! store. The Herald is glud to note the
i coming of this big Di m to Beaver and
we extend a hearty welcome to Mr,
Feinberg ami his associates." ('
A GOOD TICKET SALES RECORD
W. B. Flagler, traveling auditor
for the Rock Island railroad, was
here the last of the week going over
l-thr auduiuits of --the-local station,
Every department shows a heavy
business, but the ticket Bales during
the last eight months have been ex
ceptionally heavy. During the time
over $56,000 worth of tickets have
been sold by Ticket Agent Swan and
his helpers, and in going over the
account Frank was found to be 41
cents "long" in cash, which is a
mighty good record when you consid
er the amount of money Involved
and the length of time elapsed since
the previous audit.

Drug store. The firm will be known
as the W. D. Wiley Drug Company
