After 'Leaving Road Car Turned Over
Three Times in Its Plunge Down
the . Mountain Side.
,As a result of an automobile acci
dent on the highway between Clifton
and Morenci Sunday' last, between
ffur and five- o'clock in the afternoon,
Archie Morrisson, superintendent of
the concentrator at Clifton for the
Ariona Copper Company, Ltd.-, - and
E.' C. Heck, superintendent of the
Clifton Water & Improvement Co.,
were killed outright and Morgan Mer
rill owner of the car, L. V. Hoyt,
hia partner, Wm. O'Brien and Ben
C. 'Fehrman were injured. - Three of
the injured men are still. confined in
the A. C. hospital as the- result of
their injuries. Morgan Merrill ds
badly bruised about the face and body
in addition to having two ribs and an
arm broken. Wm. O'Brien suffered
a broken leg and L. V. Hoyt has a
sprained back and a -broken wist.
Ben Fehrman was only slightly cut
and1 bruised.
W. R. Hutchins and 6. F. Await
who had been riding in the car earlier
in the afternoon fortunately alighted
from the car before the stat to Mo
renci was made.
Early Sunday afternoon Mr. Mer
rill invited Messrs. Morrisson, Hutch
ins, Await and Hoyt for a ride and
after driving about the city a trip
was made to the new smelter.. On
returning the car stopped at the New

Mr.
OBrie-m was riding on a small seat
iu the center and Messrs. Fehrman
Heck and Hoyt occupied the 'back
. seat. The ride was made to Morenci
without mishap and after a short stay
there the party started on the return
to Clifton where a dinner party had
been arranged at the New Mess.
On the return trip the - car had
reached a point aout half way be
tween Clifton and Morenci, when the
accident occurred. It is estimated
that the car was running - not less
than twenty-five miles an hour when
jt left the road way and plunged
down the . rocky hill side. One ac
count of the .accident is that Merrill
at this point turned hia head to
apeak to the occupants in the rear
seat and .- momentarily lost control
.of the wheel. Another aceount is
that in making a turn in the ' road
Merrill pulled the car over - to the
upper bank of the cut and-'ln right
ing the steering wheel threw'-- the
car across the road to the left and
down the Mil. '
As the front wheels went over the
embankment the big car turned a
somersault in. the air, end for end.
Plunging down the hill it turned completely-over
twice more, struck on
its wheels and took a zig zag course,
running backwards, until it landed
upside down in an open out about 12
feet deep on the Shannon - Railway
tracks, approximately two hundred
ysrds below where the car left the
highway.
The occupants of the car ; were
thrown out when it turned ov the
f rst time. Archie Morrisson and
E. C. Heck evidently struck head
foremost as their skulls were fractur
ed. Morrisson was killed instantly
but Heck was still breathing when
Buck Crabtree and Scott Brode, two
men riding horses from Morenci, and
who witnessed the accident, reached
the scene. The bodies were strewn
down the hill side for a distance of
fifty feet from the road.
A car driven by Spezia Brothers
was a Thort distance behind tte fatal
car coming to Clifton and following
the Spezia car was the Laney car.
Tie occupants of these two cars as
sisted the dying and injured into their
cars and hurried them to the A. C.
hospital at Clifton. Morrisson was
pronounced dead upon his arrival at
the hospital and Heck only lived a
few minutes. Their bodies were
taken to the Fascoe Undertaking Par
lors during the evennig and the in
jured were given every attention by
the hospital staff.
News of the accident spread like
wild fire over the community and the
townspeople were appalled at the
terrible catastrophe. Knots of citi
zens were gathered here and there
expressing their sorrow and regret
over the loss of two of the prominent
citizens in our midst.
At the morgue the Masonic and
Elks Lodges detailed two of their
members to watch over the remains
of their dead and relatives were noti
fied. A brother of E. C. Heck, Mr.
W. B. Heck, of Kansas City, Mo.,
arrived in Clifton on Tuesday after
noon and started back to Mr. Heck's
old home at Lathrop, Mo., with the
remains on Wednesday morning. The
casket was escorted to the train by
members of Clifton Lodge No. 1174
B. P. O. E.
The Masonic lodge took charge of
the funeral arrangements for Mr.
Morrisson which were held at the
family residence in North Clifton on
Wednesday afternoon. The funeral
sermon was preached by Rev. Curry,
II. Love at the house and the ritual
istic services of the Masons was held
at the grave. The funeral procession
through the city was escorted on foot
by the members of the Masons and
Elks and every available conveyeance
in the city was required to accommo
date the friends of the deceased. The
active pall bearers were Ben Spriggs,
,Sam Spriggs, John M. Webster, Jas.
II. Kerby, Hi C. Mix, and W.. J.
Riley. The honorary' .pall bearers
were E. M. Williams, Sam Abraham,
Henry Hill, Tom Smith, Ben M. Craw
ford, O. J. Cotey, John Grimes, Dave
Clark, Pete Torrence, James Smith
and Adam Smith. -.
Archie Morrisson was born to Scot
land May 21, 1857 and arrived in
Clifton March 17, 1887. He was
married in this city on June 4th, 1890
to Grace Brown, who still survives
him. Mr. Morrisson was. one of the
oldest employees of the Arizona Cop-'
per Company, Ltd., having been con
tinuously in their employ for - the
past twenty-aiine years.

commission to protest against . the
raise of $380,510 in the valuation of
the Arizona and New Mexico railroad,
decreed by the tax commission at its
November meeting, and to ask that a
reduction be granted. His request
for a reduction was based principally
on the fact that for. nearly five months
beginning September 11, 1914, the
three big copper companies - of the
Clifton district of Arizona, which tiMs
company serves, were tied up by - a
strike, as a result of which, according
to his statement, "not a pound of ore.
was mined or smelted by any of the
companies, and the freight business
normally created by these companies
ceased absolutely." Mr. Drysdale
said that the companies affected by
the strike the Shannon, Detroit and
Arizona, contributed, during the fiscal
year ending June 30, last, 74.36 per
cent of the total business handled by
the Arizona nd New Mexinn railroad.

of oils, with a view to determining
the relations of the oils and th oil
mixture to the minerals contained
in the ore.
Oil flotation has revolutionized the
milling business and has made possi
ble the profitable working of de
posits that have not heretofore been
available. It has also given value

The Arizona State Bureau of Mines
