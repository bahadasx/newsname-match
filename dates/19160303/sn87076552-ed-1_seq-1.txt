WHY VI1LLIS?
Reaaon. Why Governor Frank P. Wit
lis Should hm Re-elected Governor
of tha Stata of Ohio Aa They Ay
pear to Aa Ordinary Citizen. '
There are many reasons why the
writer of thia article is convinced
that Governor Willia ahould bo re
elected as the chief executive of the
Stata at tha general election next
November; only a few of them may
be given in the space allotted to
thia article, bot perhaps a sufficient
reason to any fair minded person
would be that tha Governor might
have oportunity to continue and
complete tne aplendid work of his
administration thus far in replacing
tha power and control in the hands
of ,electors of the State, cleaning op
the mass of legislative rubbish which
had been placed on the statue books
by. a previous administration and
getting tha financial affairs of the
State on a safe and sano basis.
Governor Willis waa elected on a
platform which pledged his adminis
tration to economy as well aa effi
ciency and it is a matter of fact that
cannot be hidden by tha persistent
and malicious misrepresentations of
an antagonistic press, that pledges
have been kept in spite of the inter
ference and obstruction furnished by
members of the opposition party. The
standard of efficiency has been raiB
ed in every department of State gov
ernment and thousands of dollars
have been saved to the taxpayers of
the State in the cutting off of un
necessary offices and expenses .Gov
ernor Wi'lis had about 600 positions
to fill and there were about 60.000
hungry office seekers to aoDease but
b the face of the bitter criticism of
these office seekers of his own party
he has kept steadfastly to his pur
pose of eliminating the unnecessary
positions and insisting upon those who
do hold positions under his adminis
tration giving full value in - service
for the. salaries they draw from the
State.
Here are Just a few instances: The
cost of maintaining the automobile
department has been decreased from
13 per cent of the receipts in 1914 to
8 per cent of tha receipts in 1915, a
savins' of more than 137.000. In
tke office of tha Bureau of Vital Sta
tistics a saving of $11,000 has been
effected by the introduction of a new
office system and the work of this
deoartment has been brought up to
oate without additional exoense al
th"ngh it waa a year behind.
" Under Attorney General Hogan
th nnses of the office in 1914 were
1 SO 033.84. Under Attomev Gener
al Tumor the expenses of the office
were i.7l.fifl7.Z8. a decrease and sav
Ira- of 58 SK.VB6, and this office had
rendered 1.158 official oninions - in
1915 as comnared with 715 in 1914.
, During 1915 the Wil'is tax com
mission collected MJ7.353.50 aa com
pared with 275.R95.22 in 1914 a gain
o' $41,458.28 and much of .this wai
delinquent taxes which should have
been collected under Mr. Hogan.
In the Stata Treasurer's nfTl a
law had been enacted requiring that
the State Treasurer collect direct
the individuals all money due the
Stata from tha Board of State Chari
ties, Public Works and Insurance De
partment thereby increasing tha work
of this office by thirty-three and
one third per cent. Thia work has
heen handled by tha present Stata
Treasurer without any additional cost
in salariea whatever.
. Tha cost of administering the Stata
Highway department has been re
duced mora than one third, making
a aaving of $55,864.49. The cost of
the Insurance Department ia $2,700.
00 per year less than under the Cox
administration.
Salaries in -the Stata Library have
been cut down to the tune of $5,520.00.
Tha Board of Public Worka has in
creased collections 45 per cent, and
aecreasea me amount spent lor sala
ries $8,640.00. The Public Utilities
Commission under Willia has ac
complished one forth more work
than under tha nrnraA
tion and has cost the State $30,390.00

P
Founders of The Churches of Christ
, in Fulton County Brief Biograph
ies and Incidents in the Early His
tory of The Christian Churches
From notes furnished us bv Misa
Olive Roos we gather some very in
teresting facts concerning the found
ing and pioneer work of The Churches
of Christ in the county which will be
of interest not only to members of
these churches but aa well to many
of the older residents of the county
who are not connected with this body
of Christens, but to whom many of
the names mentioned will be familiar
and recall many very pleasant remin
iscences, it .goes without saying that
in the development of our count from
a wilderness to its present condition
the preaching of the Gospel of Christ
and the churches with their various
forms of social service and their teach
ing, have been very important factors
and among the churches that have
brought and perpetuated the Chris
tian -spirit in Fulton county the Chris
tian church occupies, a prominent
place.
From the notes furnished by Miss
Roos we gather that one of the earl
iest of tha pioneers and founders of
the Disciple or Christian church in
Fulton -county was Moses Ayers; a
man who to use Miss Roos' words liv
ed a life well spent, made the world
better for having lived in it and whose
life commended itself to all who knew
him.
Moses Avers was one of the charter
members of the church at Brush Creek
Lucas county, now Spring Hill, Fulton
county, which was organized in March
1841, by Benjamin Alton of DeKalb
county, Indiana,
Moses Ayers was born July 2nd,
1804 in Maryland; he came into what
is now Fulton county, February 26th,
1838 and his cabin home was the stop
ping place for people going and com
ing from Eastern Ohio, to Indiana.
His family consisted of seven children,
five boys and two girls, r rom some In
diana people Mr. Ayers heard of Bro
ther Tlton whom later he engaged to
come and hold a meeting in his home.
Mr. Alton came and held the meetings
which Mr. and Mrs. Ayers enjoyed
preparing for in this hospitable cabin
home. Mr. Alton baptized seven hun
dred and eight and before leaving
organized the Spring Hill church with
seventeen charter members. .
Mr. Ayers could not promise Bro
ther Alton any money for his services,
but when this earnest worker started
to return to his home in Indiana, Mr.
Ayera gave him a cow worth twenty-
five or thirty dollars. Mrs. Ayers
died December 19th, 1854 and Mr.
Ayera was again married October 10,
1855, to Altha South worth. After
his second marriage he moved to
Michigan and located at what is now
NUes; ho took bis religion with him
and did what he could to establish
Christianity in that neighborhood. It
was through his efforts tnat urotner
C. J. Blackman was brought to Mor
ay's Corners, now Lyons and establish
ed a church there in 1858 or 69. Bro
ther Ayers advanced the cause of
Christianity to the day of his death
which occurred May 19th, 1884. The
above facts in regard to Mr. Avers
were furnished by James S. Kiddle.

EFFICIENCY: III SERVICE
A Wonderful Machine That Increases the" Efficiency of
A Wauseon Banking Institution Provisions For
the Convenience and ' Comfort of -Ladies By
Wauseon Business -Houses
There is nothing that gives the ,01 Spencer-Edgar-Volhner Co., and the
publishers of the Tribune more pleas
ure than to call attention to and
chronicle the progress and sussessful
achievements of the people and in
stitutions of Wauseon and Fulton
county. In fact we look upon this as
part of the service which we should
newspaper render to the com
munity we represent. Whether it be
an individual, a church, a school, a
lodge, a club or 1 a business institu
tion that has performed somemert
torious act, contributed to the wel-
Brigham-Guilford Dept. store. These
are ways in which the " business" in
stitutions of our town are serving the
people of . tha community with out
seeking compensation for such ser
vice other than to attract people to
their places of business and to the
town as a trading-and business cen
ter. It gives -us pleasure to call at
tention to these things and so help
the people of the community to ap
preciate the advantages of their own
noma town.

fare or progress of the community in
any way, or achieved a success in
an industrial or business way, we
look upon it as Dart of the service
which we as a local newspaper should
render to our community to call at
tention to tnese tnings, and as we
said before, we take pleasure in do
ing it. Many people are afflicted
with what we may call "far sighted
ness"; they can see and appreciate
things that are at a distance, in some
city or larger town for instance, while
they fail to see and appreciate things
lust as meritorious and worthv in
their own community. .Manifestly we
should all enjoy life' more if we
might appreciate and so participate
in the benefit to be derived from the
things worth while which are near at
hand.
The specific matter which gives rise
to the above remarks is the install
ation by the Peoples State Bank of
a Burroughs Posting Machine which
adds materially to the efficiency of
their counting room and so equips
that institution to render better ser
vice in the way of promptness and
accuracy to their customers.
The new Burroughs Machine is in
deed a wonderful machine and seems
to almost be possessed with the in
telligence of an expert book-keeper:
here is a partial list of the things it
does.
Prints and adds the old balance,
Prints and substracts the checks,
Prints and adds the deposits. Com
putes and adds the new balance. De
tects prints an automatically marks
overdrafts.
Automatically prints the dates,
handles old and new balances in one
run (when proving). Is available for
regular adding in any emergency.
The machine is run by an electric
motor and is so adjusted that it shuts
off the current automatically when
not in use.
Another feature of the Peoples
Bank equipment which perhaps is not
well known is the Ladies Rest Room
at right of the main entrance, this
room is beautifully furnished with
comfortable chairs and a desk and
has a toilet room in connection. This
room is intended for the use of ladies
whether customers of the bank or
not and all ladies are welcome to its
use; in fact the directors will be glad
to have ladies make use of it. it is a
very convenient place for an ordin
ary sized committee to meet when
such meeting must be held at short
notice or to write a letter or just to
rest. At least two other business houses
in Wauseon maintains a ladies rest
room and we believe there are others
though our attention has not been
called to them we refer to the stores

the purpose of the organiztaion is to

those who are worthy of credit to
obtain it at any business,- place in
Wauseon. Any person who is worthy
of credit will be benefited rather than
injured by the system for the reason
that such a person will be reported
to every merchant in town as being
entitled to credit and he can then ob

asked. . On the other hand if a man

necessary to say the European farmer
