pintm.ent warding the results of,

expressed in the House of Lords by i
iEart Derby, the former chief of the!
recruiting service. He laid the hlan e :
which is aimed at an easy exemption
of single men, especially those re
quired to work on necessities by thf
government, also the agriculturists.
Derby made an emphatic plea to
the government to prevent bachelors
of military age from evading nilitary

specialized occupations. He declared
a strong effort would be necessary to
obtain the requisite number of fight

He said the agriculturists were the
principal class to avail themselves of
the exemption under the plea they
were indispensible for the production
of food stuffs for the government.
There are promises to revise the list
of reserved trades with a view of
releasing more men for the army.

yesterday when the operators refused
to agree upon three cent a ton in

proposal of one cent a ton' advance.
It is said the1 Illinois coal (iompanies

ANOTHER GRAVE
ACCIDENT AT
DEATH CURVE
Three People Injured When
- l
Buick "Six" Overturns at
Point in the Hereford-Bis
bee Highway.
The curve on the Hereford roaa,
just before crossing the South
western tracks, was the scene of
another accident yesterday when
a big Buick, six cylinder machine
turned completely over injuring
all of the occupants and Mrs. H.
T. Gabilondo, of Douglas, quite
severely. The other two occupants
H. T. Gabilondo and Eduardo Ga
bilondo were slightly hurt, but not
seriously.
This is the second wreck at the
same spot within eight weeks. In
the last one a Mexican, by the
name of Manuel Guaderrana from
El Paso, was killed and several
other occupants of the car were
seriously injured. Besides the se
rious accidents several machines
have turned over on the curve or
have been disabled.
, It has been oticed that, in the
great majority of cases, those who
have accidents on the curve have -j
never been over the road before.
Frcm a down-hill straightaway '
the road, of a sudden, goes into
the sharp curve. On the. outside
of the curve a culvert has been
built and all of the accidents have
been traced to cars hitting the
edge of this obstruction and turn
ing over.
Yesterday's accident occurred
shortly after noon. A rancher by
the name of Iooling. from the
Huachucas. was passing and aid
ed the injured people from under
the err. He also helped them in
reaching Bisbee. Ijiter machines
from the District .were sent to the
scene of the accident and found
the auto badly wrecked.
