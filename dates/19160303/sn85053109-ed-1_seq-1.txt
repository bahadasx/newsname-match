CUT
BANK, TETON COUNTY, MONTANA, FRIDAY, MARCH 3, 1 9 1 6.
Two Dollars Per Year
In Interest of the
Thrift Movement
Banks to Cooperate With
School To Further
the Move
^Carlton A. Giier of Coeur d
Alene, Idaho, western repre
sentative of the Registered
Tracery System, spent .last Fii
day in Cut Bank, conferring
with local bankers and Principal
Marlow of the local school, with
the purpose in view of giving
the initial impetus to the thrift
movement, now being taken up
all over the country.
The system is built upon the
proposition that if the pennies
are given the proper attention,
the dollars will take care of
themselves, and upon the sug
gestion that competition is one
of the greatest incentives to a
youthful mind. Everyone real
izes the value of teaching thrift
to a child lies in the fact that
he will probably retain his early
training. In carrying out this
"system bank" plan, the ideas
of thrift will be taught in the
school-room, like other subject?.
One room will be matched
against another, and some prize
given to the room having the
largest aggregate deposits, the
prize to be moved around as
the amounts may vary.
Each child with a deposit of
ten cents may receive a system
bank from which one of our
banks his parents choose for
him. and in this bank, which
contains a book, he may keep a
record of his savings, which,
when reaching à dollar îèFtïftten
to the local bank and deposited
to his credit. Once a month he
takes this card to the teachei
and his report of deposits and
savings is copied onto the rec
ord card of the school. He will
be encouraged and will take
great pride in his growing sav
ings.
Mr. Grier called at the Pio
neer Press office Friday evening
to solicit cooperation in the
move and gave the information
that the bankers and school
faculty were heartily in accord
with the plan and that it would
be inaugurated without delay.
"The bankers here evinced a
fine spirit of cooperation and
good will toward each other, a
condition that one does not find
in all the smaller cities, anc 1
were keenly in sympathy with
the idea from the beginning,"
said Mr. Grier.

Can A Clique of Low, Lazy
Leeches Control Our Politics
At The Coming City Election?
Within the past month a number of tin-horns
who are eligible to vote in Cut Bank have return
ed to town and the information has leaked out
that these tin-horns are in a "frame-up" to fix
matters politically so that they will not fear inter
ence in conducting gambling here.
We wonder if the citizens of Gut Bank who
are for law, order and. progress will stand supi ;ely
by and allow these pale, palsied parasites to dictate
the politics of the town. These low, lazy leeches
have no property and no other interests here.
They contribute nothing to our upbuilding and
much toward our downpulling. They have neither
morals nor honor. They would be trainrobbers if
they had the courage; porchclimbers or sheep
stealers if laziness did not prevent. That a coterie
of coarse, brazen, law-defying poker sharks should
attempt to dictate our municipal affairs is as repug
nant to our sense of decency as the right of illiter
ate black 'niggers' to run the politics of the South
is repugnant to the self-respecting whites.
The Pioneer Press here and now ventures this
bit of political prophesy: The persons who seek
to use the voting strength of the poker fraternity
to lift themselves into office at the coming election
will be swamped by the too-patient respectable
voters of this town. The day of domination by
the enemies of good government in Cut Bank is
done, if we mistake not.
Personal
L W. Robnett will shortly
embark in the general transfer
business in Cut Bank and will
handle wood, coal and ice. Mr.
Robnett has arranged to handle
the ice business exclusively
and will give it his chief atten
tion during the summer season.
He is now erecting a coal and
wood shed adjoining the Klein
shop, which he will make his
headquarters. Robnett is an
obliging and efficient fellow and
without doubt will give the
public the best of service.
Mrs. M. S. Bush and Mrs.
Jas. Malone were hostesses at
a progressive card party, at the

ing. The dominating color note,
pink and white, was carried out

the reception rooms. A large
number of friends of both host
esses vied for honors in a series
of games that were replete with
zest and merriment. An elabo
rate luncheon was served at
the conclusion of the series.
Otto Bauman, the Veterinär
ian, arrived from Fort Benton
Monday. He will remain here
a short time at present and will
return to Fort Benton. After
staying at that place for a brief
time he plans on returning to
Cut Bank to spend the remain
der of the year on his home
stead.
John Bliesener, who was a
caller yesterday, fears that
farmers are to experience some
difficulty in securing good work
horses this spring, as they seem
quite scarce at present. He
says the farmers out his way
are planning on larger farming
operations this spring than ever
before.
Mrs. Charles Lynch was host
ess at two parties at her home,

among other conveniences will
have a full-sized cement base
ment, in which he will have in
stalled a heating plant. It is
probable that other farmers in
the community will erect more
substantial buildings in the
present year.
H. Cardwell, who resides
near Headlight Butte, was a
caller Monday and told the
writer of a piece of skilful vet
erinary surgery performed on a
large draft horse, by L. Joslyn.
