romance of Edgar Allen Poe. One
of the first semes in the pav is of
the statue of Poe, taken in New
York City. Mr. Walthall, who bears
a remarkable likeness to Poe, grad
ually supplants the statue, but the
'-features aire so exactly alike and the
photography so remarkable that the

February 24th in the evening. Mis
ses Kathryn Lee and Katherine Mc
Carthy proved delightful hostesses,
and though chaffing dish refresh
ments only were served, which sug
gests to onr masculine mind almost
insurmountable difficulties in the way
of any thing substantial, it was not
for mere, uninvited man to judge,
since twenty young ladies who were
guests are enthusiastic in their
praise of their ho^esses' culinary
ability. The occasion was in the na

the Lamesteer district south
west of this city Wednesday,when,
Miss Gladys Pearl Lyst and Mr.
John A. Nelson, popular young peo
ple of near Carlyle, were united
in marriage by Justice Simon S.
Horn. The bride was attired in a
very pretty dark blue dress, and was
attended by Miss Venetia Cobleigh,
of Carlyle, while the groom wore
the usual black. Henry L. Larson
acted as best man. Both young
people have been residents of the
Carlyle neighborhood for some time
and have a host of friends who has
ten to extend their best wishes for
a long and happy journey through
life. Mr. and Mrs. Kelson left the

prominent farmer and rancher in
the Upper Golden Valley. The bride
is a popular young woman of many
excellent qualities. After a few
few days' stay in Beach, the happy
couple will make their home on the
groom's place north.
A deal was consummated this
week whereby James Powers as
sumes the management of the Beach
Opera House, last night's "movie"
program being the initial perform
ance of the new management. Mr.
Power is an energetic and capable
young man, and will devote his en
ergies to the production of high class
entertainment. "The Battle Cry of
Peace,'" by far the most pretensious
film production which has ever been
brought to Beach, is the fore-runner
of a series of high class pictures
which will place the opera house on
a par with the theatres of the big
cities. One of the largest crowds
ever gathered in the opera house
witnessed "The Battle Cry of
Peace," and the management is to
be congratulated on its success in
bringing this film to Beach.
Considerable interest is being man
ifested by the young people of the
city in the band, which has been
under way for several months. Tho
larger number of the members
are deriving their first experience
in band work and all of them
are attaining remarkable proficiency
since the present instructor, D. M.
Cooper, has assumed charge. Re
gular weekly meetings are being held
in the Linger hall and are well at
tended, which speaks well for the
director and the interest of the mem
bers enrolled. Mr. Cooper is an ex
perienced bandsman and makes a
very valuable director.

Prisoners Attempt
to Break Jail
Plot Nipped in the Bud Wooden
Keys, Fashioned From Wagon
Wheel Sppke, Found in Prisoner's
Dickinson, February 29, 1916.—
A well laid plot by some of the
prisoners in the county jail to gain
their freedom, was ripped in the
bud during iho week- Word reachcd
ifeputy Sheriff Hoist that W. H.
Neville, e^-policeman and ex-peni
tentiary guard, in jail on the charg.i
|f box car robbery, *as making
wooden keys and other toiplrraents
to be used in jail breaking Au im
mediate search was made, and iu
Nevill's bunk in the cage were found
two keys, fashioned from a hard
wood wagon wheel spoke, a pair of
pliers and a makeshift saw fasnioncd
from a portion of his cot. Although
Neville has been confined to a cage
•luring b'-. st'.y in jail, h: had un
doubtedly been the moving spirit in a
jail breaking attempt. Some of the
other prisoners evidently were as
sistants to Nevills in the deal. It
seems that in bringing up coal to the
jail one of the prisoners had hidden
a discarded spoke under the coal,
and this was later smuggled to Nev
ills.
Additional guards have now been
placed at the jail and all future ef
forts to break out will be without
avail.
Four of the men implicated in the
robbery of freight cars, arrested
last week, plead guilty to the charges
against them this week before Jus
tice A. P. Folsom, and will receive
their sentences before Judge W. C.
Crawford as soon as he returns from
Mott. Those who plead guilty are:
John O'Connor, Pat Peters, Wilbur
Skude and Newton Hough. W. H.
Nevills, leader of the gang, refuse!
to plead guilty, and will undoubted
ly stand trial. It is alleged that
Nevills is a seasoned criminal and
that he will undoubtedly give the
authorities all the trouble he can be
fore they land him in the peniten
tiary.
A BETTER BUSINESS
MEN'S ASSOCIATION
Grand Forks, Feb. 29.—For
number of years past we have heard
a great deal about the Better Farm
ing Association of the state and
these organizations have been of
wonderful value to North Dakota,
however the farmer is now the only
man who needs to study his business.
The business man and merchant also
need to be efficient and certain move
ments now gaining ground in our
state indicate that the business men
must become effictet if they are to
reach their full usefullness and hold
their place in the scheme of things.
With the purpose of doing for the
merchants and business men what
the Better Farming Movement has
done for the farmer, the Grand
Forks Commercial Club is interest
ing its members in a Better Business
Men's Association, and has assisted
in arranging a Retail Merchats
Short Course modeled along the
same lines as the Farmers' Institute
held by progressive farmers.
Included in the program of this
short «ourse are lectures by such
experts in business management as
Frank Stockdale of Chicago, editor
of System Magazine, who talks upon
"The Lost Art of Making a Profit,*'
and "Speed in Stock Turnover H.
M. Temple of St. Paul and the Uni
versity of Minnesota upon "Account
ing for the Retail Merchant" and
John S. Taylor of Minneapolis upon
"Salesmanship." Buying, advertis
ing, overhead costs, and other re
tail problems will also be considered.

POISONERS ARE
BUSY AT GLENDIVE
Glendive, Montana, February 29.
—Efforts are bein{£ made to ascer
tain the identity of some contemp
tible individual who scattered pieces
of poisoned meajt in the vicinity of
the New Washington school building
with the result that a number of
valuable and harmless dogs were
killed. That ||ie poison was partic
ularly deadly, is evidenced by the
fact that it produced almost in
stant death. The perpetrator pro
bably does not realize the serious
ness of the, offense, or'what might
possibly result from such practice.
The dogs killed were in the habit of
playing with- small children, and aft
er eating the poison, had the animals
licked the hands of the children the
deadly potion might in this manner
have caused the death of the little
ones, themselves. The promiscuous
placing of poison is a statutory of
fense and should the guilty person
be apprehended he will, it is said,
be dealt with according to the law.
ization to be
A geneiwl Meeting lias been ealed
to take place at the Beach Opera
House next Thursday evening, March
9, at which the permanent organiza
tion of a chamber of commerce or
civic club, the name to be determined
at the meeting, will be perfected. /V
committee of five, appointed at a
meeting held two weeks ago in the
Linger hall, have completed their
canvass of local business men, and
report a generous response. Thus
far nearly three thousand dollars
have been subscribed. AH expendi
tures will be handled on the budget
system, which has been so success
ful elsewhere. A deputation from the
Miles City chnmbcr of commerce will
be present and "swap" ideas with
local men.
It should be understood that the
organization is not one for local
men only, but for farmers tributary
to Beach as well, who are earnestly
exhorted to be present and enroll
their names with the membership.
A large number, to the encourage
ment of tlie committee having the
arrangements in charge, have sig
nified their intention of being pres
ent. A general invitation to all is
extended.
A musical program for the enter
tainment of those present has been
arranged which will include vocal,
quartette and orchestra numbers. A
general good time is expected. Ar
range to be present—and don't for
get to bring the ladies.
William Rosenberg, who announces
his dissolution of partnership with
Max Lewison and as a result of the
new change is now sole proprietor
of the Beach store, has an irnport
ena announcement in this issue of
the Chronicle to which we invite the
attention of our readers. As a re
sult of the new business deal, Mr.
Rosenberg announces that he will
coutinue business in Beach, instead
of removing his stock to Ollie, as
were Messrs. Rosenberg and Lewis
on's intentions before the consuina
tion of the deal. Commencing to
morrow, March 4th, The Toggery will
inaugurate a thirteen days' sale, in
order to nuilce room for his new
and complete stock of sprint goods
which will arrive shortly. Mr. and
Mrs. Rosenberg's many friends here
are glad to learn of their resolution
to continue their residence in Bench.
Ry. Mail Service
for South Country
Schedule Will Start March 15, and
Present Star Route Discontinued.
—Other Changes to be Made.
According to information received
at the local postoffice this week,
railway mail service on the new
south branch line will begin March
15. This will be welcome news to
Golva, Carlyle and Ollie people, who
up to now have been served by the
Star route carrier.
It follows as a result of the pros
pective change that the star route
in its present form will be discontin
ued. The department at Washington
aside from the general announce
ment of the change in service, has
not advised the local postoffice as
to other changcs in service that may
occur, but it is understood that a
petition is now in the hands of offi
cials at Washington which doubtless
will result in a new rural route deliv
ery from this office. The new route
will run in a southeasterly direction
and will have a length of about
thirty miles, unless an auto delivery
service, which we understand is be
ing sonsidered, is used, in which case
the length of the route will be doub
led. Patrons of the present star
route to be discontinued with the in
auguration of the railway service
will be served in some form later.
The change has for its aim the more
efficient service of the big south
country, and though it doubtless
will take some time for the depart
ment to complete its plans, the ul
timate result will be a better, larger
service than has been enjoyed at
present.
The Alpha postoffice, the postmas
ter general announces, will be dis
continued March 15, which suggests
that Alpha patrons will be served
later with a route from Golva.
The mail of seven postoffices is
now handled through the Beach of
fices, the towns being Bonnie View,
Golva, Burkey, and Stuart, N. D.,
and Ollie, Carlyle, and Brenizer,
Montana, which occasions no little
degree of responsibility on the part
of the local postoffice force.
Postmaster J. M. Baer and his
assistant, George Ilougen through
whose efforts the prospective sched
ule is being considered by the de
partment, display a progressive at
titude which should be and is ap
preciated by this office's many pa
trons.
STATE ENGINEERS DISCUSS
N. D. ROAD BUILDING
Grand Forks, Feb. 29—The North
Dakota Society of Engineers met in
annual convention at Grand Forks
last week ad devoted a great deal
of time to the discussion of our
roads and their improvement. Among
other things the engineers compiled
and passed as official, "Standard
Specifications faor the Construction
and Maintenance of North Dakota
Dirt Roads." These specifications
are issued in pamphlet form and
they contain much valuable data and
information which should be in the
hands of those interested in good
roads all over the state. A copy of
this pamphlet may be had free of
cost by addressing the North Dakota
Development League Press Bureau
at Grand Forks asking for same.
John Rorvik, who resides two and
one half miles northeast of Beach,
was a pleasant caller at this office
Thursday, leaving as a substantial
reminder of his visit, his renewal for
the Chronicle for another year. Mr.
Rorvik formerly lived five miles
north of Beach, purchasing the Os
car Amurud farm a year ago on
which he and his family are now
making their home. He is one of
the Valley's careful farmers.

"Care of Baby"
Week for Beach
"Good Care, Good Fare, Fresh Air,
for Every Beach Baby," Slogan.—
Woman's Club Unite in Preachment
As part of a national campaigit.
having for its purpose the better
care of babies in a tight to reduce
infant mortality, the ladies' clubs of
the city have united on a course ofl
co-operative action. Though science
and modern conditions have accom
plished much in giving the baby of
today a better chance of attaining"
adulthood than was the case fifty
and a hundred years ago, the mor
tality rate remains alarmingly high,
ignorance in the care of the infant
and careless exposure of its delicate
organism to contagious influences*
being the prime causes. By far the
greater majority of baby ills are pre
ventable. It is for the purpose of
preaching the doctrine of preventa
bility and greatly reducing the mor
tality that the present campaign is
being waged.
Initiative was taken by tho Wom
en's club, t'ic other clubs of Beach—
the Social Hour club. Guild, Catholic
Ladies' Sewing Soc'ety and Ladies'
Aid societies uniii.i,' in order to giv®
tl:«. campaign a 'it»-wide inlluence.
