MUCH A REST, March 3.- The fu
neral of Queen Mother Elizabeth of !
Roumania, who died yesterday of j
pneumonia, will be held on Sunday, j
The queen mother, who was 73 years j
old, was better known by her pen
name of Carmen Sylva, under which
she produced many poems and es
says. Head of City Water Vorks
Said to Demand Right to
Run Department.
Although the board of works was
successful in preventing the reslccna
t "on of Supt. John W. Toyne last
Wednesday it is being reported that
the trouble in the waterworks de
partment has not been nettled as yet
and that the superintendent may
carry out his plan of quitting the
administration witnin a few days.
It Is understood that Mayor Kf'ler
and Pres't E. M. Morris of thn board
ff- worlr- prrt wind of Toynt-'a pro
P'lvod resignation before the Wed
nesday meeting' and prevailed upon
the superintendent to hold Tip the
matter until the school controversy
subsided. Information has it that
there is one member of the board
of works which is against letting
Toyne leave the department under
any circumstances and is not entire
ly in favor of the tactics of the ad
ministration in operating the water
works department upon a political
"reward" basis,
iVtcrinlne-d to Quit.
Early in the week Toyne was de
termined to quit because the board
or Pres't Morris insisted upon keep
in incompetent men In the depart
ment for political reasons and firing
others in order to make places for
men who "were loyal" to the ad
ministration, the loyalty consisting
of efforts to build up a Keller ma
chine. The affair was broucht to a
head by the dismissal of Frank Ry
neajson. repair man, who has been
with the water department for 11
years. He was "fired" upon the
"announced" grounds that he hud
misused an automobile.
It is understood that Toyne did not
approve of the tactics used by the
board and intended to present his
resignation Wednesday but Keller
anil Morris persuaded him to wait
j until the school matter was settled.
! fearing further disruption of their
machine Fhould the waterworks
muddle be revealed.
Tovno Compromise!.
Toyne compromised with the
board an l a treed to hold up his
resignation pending the action of
the board in accepting or rejecting
propositions which he had placed
before them. This proposition is
j said to be that he ne given a free
i hand in operating the water depart
! ment or in other words that the de
j partment be run along business line
instead of for political profit.
Xovv comes the report that unless
i the board agrees to the demands
j made hy TV.yne oefore the meeting
next Wctlii' :-day 'that his resignation
' will be banded over at that time. As
the matter now stands it appears
; that Toyne has left it to the board
I to decide whether the wat works
I department shall be operated as a
business proposition or as a political
reward institution and upon the
hoard's decision depends the rtten
! tion of Toyn.

WAR ON GERMANY
Motion was to Keep Ameri
cans From Traveling on
Belligerent Ships
Armed or Not.
SEN. GORE IS REFUSED
PERMISSION TO EXPLAIN
No Debate is Allowed and
Matter is Rushed to a
Vote Several Members
Are Not Present.
InternhtbT.nl News Service:
WASHINGTON. March C. The
senate today upheld the hands of
Pres't Wilson in the submarine sit
uation. Py an overwhelming vote of
ayes to 14 noes, it laid on the
table without debate the resolution
of Sen. Gore, democrat, Oklahoma,
whicli if adopted would have with
drawn from American citizens the
right to take passage on armed bel
ligerent ships whether armed for
offense or defense.
Probably not since the European
crisis became acute has there been
such a thronged senate wing as
struggled for admission today. Every
seat was filled, oliicial and diplo
matic Washington being well repre
sented. The senate met at 11 o'clock,
an hour earlier than usual, to get
the necessary routine out of the way
and clear tho decks for action. Evcry
member not ill or excused, was in
his seat and the tension was dis
tinctly noticeable, when Sen. Stone,
as chairman of the senate foreign
relations committee, secured recog
nition and moved that the senate
proceed to the consideration of the
Gore resolution.
Every preparation had been made
to prevent debate.
Can't Ix plain Act.
Sen. Gore, although the author of
the resolution, was refused permis
sion to explain it. Sen. James, dem
ocrat, Kentucky, being recognized by
the chair to move to lay the Gore
resolution on the table. Voting on
the resolution began at 11:40. Just
before the roll was ordered. Sen.
Gore had offered an amendment to
his resolution to contain the warn
ing that sinking of an armed mer
chant ship with Americans on board
"will be a cause of war," in that way
warning Germany what the result
must be, but the motion to table was
applied to the amendment as well
as to the original resolution.
Sen. Gore created a sensation by
voting to table his own resolution.
An hour before the senate met,
corridors and galleries were throng
ed with a sensation-seeking crowd.
Every gallery seat was Ulled and
scores of people stood about the gal
lery coridors.
House Memliers Present.
Many members of the houso
crowded the rear of the senate Jloor.
Sec'y of State Lansing's family took
seats in the front row of the diplo
matic gallery.
The senators rose and stood in
solemn silence as the chaplain pray
ed for divine guidance when tho
senate convened at 11 o'clock.
Sen. Stone asked that the reading
of the daily journal be suspended,
and the senate proceeded to rlean
much minor details of routine busi
ness. Sen. Smith of Michigan sought to
present a petition in the form of a
telegram relating to the (lore reso
lution. He wanted it rpad, but Sen.
Stone objected and the petition went
to the foreign relations committee.
The tension was relieved by a
hysterical laugh that swept floors
and galleries wben the senate re
ceived a report from the District of
Columbia committee on a bill to
close the barber shops of Washing
ton on Sunday.
Sen. Stone took the floor at 11:2".
"I ask that the senate joint reso
lution 14 be taken up," he said.
Sen. Gore jumped to his feet.
"A question of personal privilege,"
he shouted.
Prcents Amendment.
Sen. McCumber halted the pro
ceedings to present a proposed
amendment. Sen. Stone sought to
prevent the reading of the amend
ment which was in the nature of a
sub, but without result. The Mc
Cumber sub reviewed the entire in
ternational situation. It stated that
while Americans have the right to
travel on belligerent ships, it was
their duty not to exercise that right.
There was no possibility of action on
the substitute.
The Gore resolution was laid be
fore the senate at the request of
Sen. Stone. Sen. Jnmes of Kentucky
moved to lay the motion on tho
table. In vain Sr:. Gore sought an
opportunity to talk and clamored
for the floor.
Vice Pres't Marshall said Gore
could present an amendment, but
could not debate it. Thereupon the
Oklahoma senator proposed an
tmendment selling forth that "the
sinking of an armed merchant ship
with Americans on board by a Ger

Sen. James moved to lay the
amendment as well as the rstduti'.n
on the table, and a roll call vote was
ordered.
To Take I ) JiicMion.
The direct submarine cntroversv
between Germany ar.d th United
States will be pushed to immediate
settlement or permanent disagree
ment Immediately the pr s-nt dif
ferences between the administration
and congress ;ire adjusted. Action
will come very speedily, it was learn
ed at both the white house and the
state department today. The latest
German proposals nre admitte.'.ly
unsatlsfactory to the president. The
supplemental note, despite the spe
cific German denials, is h Id ma
terially to abridge ass jiance pre
viously given.
Convinced at last that the de
mands ef the administration were be
ing given weight in congress, and
that proposed warning legislation
would eventually be discredited by
decisive voto in both houses th.
president today prepared for Iks
next step Ir: the matter. It is ex
pected that this will take the ft. rm
of telling Count von Hernstorff that
the proposals made la.st week. ar
entirely unsatisfactory. Sec'y Irn
sing will then, ai the direction of thei
president, outline exactly what the
government wants done. If Ger
many accepts, the critical stage of
the negotiations will have been pass
ed. If she declines to agree to the
president's contentions a break hard
ly car. be averted.
Although the appendices to tho
latest German note have not yet ar
rived, the action of the British ad
miralty ir making public what it
says are the complete orders to mer
chant commanders, may make con
sideration of them unnecessary.
Great Britain flatly denies that her
merchantmen are authorized to uo
their armament at any time for of
fensive purposes. Instead great
stress is laid upon what constitutes
defensive tactics, it being pointed out
that, inasmuch as the allied subma
rines and air craft have been in
structed to give merchant vessels a
wide berth, the fact that any such
should bo sigjited approaching is
held sufficient proof thit they an
enemy craft attacking ai d the mer
chant vessel may keep them at a
distance by using their guns "for
that, purpose in defense."
This is what Germany complain
of. but Sec'y Lansing already h:4
taken tho position that a men hant
