TO THE CITIZENS OF DES
MOINES.
I am a candidate for municipal
judge. You know the importance o£
this court. Perhaps 60 per cent of
all your cases in law will come before
this court. Therefore it is to your
interests to huve a man on the bench
of the municipal court who in his
sympathies is as broad as humanity,
a man who in his interpretation of
civil rights regards all men as equal.
If elected to the municipal bench I
will see that every man who comes
before me, regardless of race or creed
or party, receives justice tempered
with sympathy and help. The judi
cial bench should be a symbol of help
for the offender as well as a symbol
of protection for society. The inter
ests of both society and the ogendev
should be guarded. I claim the sap
port of the voters of Des Moines on
the basis of my humanitarian inter
ests of both society and the offender
fail me. Your interests and my sym
pathies are linked together, and you
cannot afford to separate them. I
am qualified to sit on the municipal
bench, especially qualified, as may be
easily seen by an examination of the
legal works I have compiled and
edited. I was selected by a commit
tee of the legislature to compile the
supplement of 1913, containing all the
general and permanent Iowa laws en
acted between1897 and 1913. I also
edited the Index to the Code of Iowa
and Supplements. These works were
authorized and published by the state
of Iowa. My record is open. I in
vite investigation. I respectfully so
licit your vote.
Charles S. Wilcox.

office before, and he feels that with

identification with courts of this
county that he would be a competent
person for the municipal bench. His
many friends solicit your vote for

For Diseases of the Skin.
Nearly all diseases of the skin,
such as eczema, tetter, salt rheum
and barbers' itch, are characterized
by an intense itching and smarting,
which often makes life a burden and
disturbs sleep and rest. Quick relief
may be had by applying Chamber
lain's Salve. It allays the itching and
smarting almost instantly. Many
cases have been cured by its use. For
sale by all dealers.

pal court. Mr. Sellars is an attorney

MR BARRETT HAS ANNOUNCED
HIS CANDIDACY FOR SCHOOL
TREASURER FOR SECOND
TERM.
In Mr. Barrett's reply to the school
board's public letter he calls attention
to the fact that it was he who first
offered to serve and did serve the dis
trict without compensation, and he
I also points to the economical and ef
ficient manner in which the funds of
the district have been handled. Not
one cent has his office cost the tax
payers, though on the other hand he
has collected and given the district
credit for thousands of dollars of in
terest on balance. Mr. Barrett is ask
ing a second term on his merit and
record he has already made. He says,
"The same influences that are oppos
ing me now oppressed me two years
ago, and are the same interests who
have had the school funds under their
control for nearly a quarter of a cen
tury. They fought hard to avoid giv
ing up the office then and want back
again after only two years.

sources to make his living. He is in
sympathy with the common masses
cf people. His ancestors are of the
old abolitionist stock, which makes
him sympathize with the struggling
colored people, and if elected would
no douobt giv^ equal justice, jts he
11 all other classes, and his friends
solicit your supoprt.
MACKINNON FOR SCHOOL
TREASURER.
We present this week the cut of
Mr. G. E. Mackinnon, president of the
Mechanics Savings bank, who is a
candidate for treasurer of the school
board in Des Moines. Mr. Mackinnon
is one of the active young men of
push and energy in our city and be
longs to Aiany clubs. He stands for
everything that is good, high and
ideal in club and in business life. He
ie one of the strong young business
men and would no doubt make a
splendid treasurer for our school
board, and I can present better his
position in a letter to the secretary
of the school board, which is as fol
lows:
"Mr. A. L. Clinite, Secretary, and
the Honorable Members of the Inde
pendent School District of the City of
Des Moines, Iowa:
"Replying to a communication from,
your honorable body, I beg leave to
state that some weeks ago my an
nouncement was made as a candidate
for school treasurer I was then aware
you had received no encouragement
to the demand you made a year ago
for more modern and up-to-date meth
ods in the handling of the financial
affairs of .the school district. Believ
ing the people recognize your de
mands are just, I decided to place my
name before them with the assurance
that I will apply the same good busi
ness principles to the conduct of their
business as are applied in the conduct
of a successful private business.
"In answer to your specific ques
tions:
"First—At what rate and what per
cent of tha average daily balances in
your hands as treasurer will you pay
interest?
"Answer—I will pay 2 per cent in
terest on the total of the average
daily balances.
"Second—Will you agree to cash
warrants of the district and not
charge interest thereon when there is
a net balance in your hands, consid
ering all the funds of the district to
gether?
"My answer it: Yes.
"Third—At what rate will you pay
interest on the insurance funds?
"Answer—Four per cent.
"I can also state I am assured of
the co-operation of several other
banks who will share in the handling
of the school board's business along
the lines here suggested.
"I am sure the people will approve
this new plan, for it would be very
poor business policy for a business
man to borrow money at 6 per cent on
a note if he had cash in his pocket
-»r money in the bank drawing but 2
per cent interest.
"Respectfully yours,
"G. E. MacKinnon."
OUR CITY PRIMARIES.
One week from next Monday the
voters that are qualified will be called
upon to select the different candidates
for all the offices of our great and
growing city and three school direct
ors and the school treasurer. Upon
your judgment and discretion rest the
safety and kind of city administraT
W-'.:
tion that you will have. You, Mr.
Voter, he very careful in selecting the
men for office. Lay aside personal
friendship and vote for the man who
is the best qualified and most fitted
by experience, age and educational
qualification, for if we select good,
honest, successful men in their line
of work the chances are *hat we
will have a safe city government.
This week and next week we will run
the cuts and history of nearly all of
the candidates, so read and judge for
yourselves.
JENNEY FOR COUNCILMAN.
We take great pleasure in present
ing to our readers the cut of John W.
Jenney, candidate for councilman of
Des Moines. He is one of the old suc
cessful business men of the city, hav
ing been in -the grocery business for
twenty years. He was born in Clay
ton county, Iowa, in 1866, came to
Polk county 35 years ago, and has
lived in our city ever since. He has
aided and seen the development from
small town to a growing city, and
has never held an elective office. He
was secretary of the Iowa Humane
society for four years and two years
as chief of police. With the experi
ence of twenty years in the grocery
business gives him the qualities of a
business man, four years with the hu
mane society familiarizes him with
the needs of humanity, and two years
as chief of police acquaints him with
the^riminal department of our city.
Mr. Albert Edward Greenlaw of
Toronto, Canada, the famous baritone
soloist, is in our city this week as
soloist for Dr. Gordon's revival meet
ings, being held at the Plymouth
Congregational church. Prof. Green
law is considered one of the finest
singers in Canada. He has a musical
studio there and is a graduate of Fisk
university. He was one of the famous
Fisk Jubilee singers many years ago.
We would advise everybody to hear
him while in the city. He sings two
solos every evening at each meeting
conducted by Dr. Gordon. He is a
fine specimen of an educated Chris
tian manhood, and is a credit to our
race and to any race in his profession.
MASONIC NOTES AND NUGiGETS.
On Official Visit.
On leaving the Capital City on
Tuesday for Waterloo, Iowa, to meet
my Wellington, Rev. Bess, W. M., and
his gallant army of thirty-one Mas
ter Masons, a creature of mine less
than one year old. Really my eyes
did meet my Waterloo, for ^o my sur
prise thip small body of Masons
had done in less than one year. They
started out with no money, nothing.
Now they bought a lot 50x132 feet
and have just completed a large two
story hall 24x52 feet long, completely
modern, lighted from basement to top
with electric lights, with kitchen, ante
rooms, gas stove, chairs, altars and
light" over all the altars. The first
floor is made for a store room and we
understood that it is promised to a
man to open up a grocery store. This
lodge has certainly set an example
for all of the lodges in this jurisdic
tion, even old North Star, who wan
dered forty years in the wilderness
before she purchased a home. The
men are all working in peace, love
and harmony and they have accom
plished great things by so doing. We
had a fine meeting v^ith the brothers.
They served a nice banquet about 1
o'clock. We initiated one candidate
and delivered a part of my lecture.
We found ourselves next evening
(Wednesday) the guest of Harry W.
Rose, Jr., W. M. of Dubuque, No. 29.
We met most all of the home mem
bers. This lodge is growing and do
ing well. We was served to a nice
lunch. Our next stop was with Mc
Neil lodge. Rev. F. J. Nott is the W.
M., who royally entertained us while
there. At 6 o'clock we went to the
hull, where the ladies of Leah chapter,
No. 8, O. E. S., had prepared a ban
quet for us Master Masons and visi
tors. It was a beautiful sight, a table
about forty feet long with place cards
with the name of each visitor and
Mason present, beautiful flowers.
The banquet was served in six courses
and consisted of everything that we
knew of and many things we did not
know the r.ame of. The visitors were
John E. Bradford, R. W. G. senior
warden, and Rev. H. K. Nicholson of
Davenport, and Rev. W. W. Williams.
We held a vjery instructive and inter
esting meeting until 11:80, when we
