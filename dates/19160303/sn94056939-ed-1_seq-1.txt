A very just complaint Indeed, uuil
after nil tho rato of taxation, the
amount of tux, or the valuation
placen on t no properly is ol no
'apedul Interest. TIih essinco of
the whole subject of taxation is an
equal distribution of the burden of
tuxuiliiii proportionate In the ability
to pay of the subject taxed.
In this state for a number of
yours, wu havo listened to subsistí
tint and continuous complaints with
reforonce to taxation Tills stibjeot
has been considered by governors
legislators, tax officials and tax
payors with an earnest deliro to
nrriv? at some method which might
remedy existing ills ciimplulnod of.
The (inner al complaint, during pre.
vloiisyears mLditbo briefly summed
up us follona:
Thai our tax rata wan outragn
ously high as compared with ilther
ttica Hint gross Inequalities ex
Islet), discriminations in asiessinenla
and it, litis also been alleged Hint
vast amounts of property failed to
moko its appearance upon the
assessment rolla. In order tn at
tempt to remedy Hid alleged non
dilibtis (ho last Laglsinttiro discussed
the tax sliiintion with grunt earnest
hess and thoroughness, coupled with
ail ejiriiost desire to formúlalo such
a pntiuy and enact audi legislation
ña would relievo and romody ills
crimpliiined of.
Many legislativo bills woro Intro
dii.écd seeking to bring about n
iiirfrn equitable plan of distribution
of VI to burdens of taxatinn, t ho net
reatilt of which we havo on the
statute books In the form of legla
tallón enacted by our last legislative
nssmnblv.
The theory of thn present law Is
to so limit tho nmount of lovy or
.JaxMiiin as will create a necessity
fwRfch will command I ho assessment
of nil properly or miliV. Huí e life-
quencos of it delimoncy In current
retamo Tho r tn limit fixed by
atilinto Is n reasonable, one as com
pared with thn rule of taxation In
older states, mid wm arrived at
upon the basis that i luí ci'lzens of
i hie sin te aluui'd be permit led to
lefray the expenses of government
within renaoiittbl rniign Of a tax
ruto as computed will oilier pro
gressive slnlcs nf Hie Union, and
i hat our Income which is naturally
fixed liy tho limita Ion of a lax levy,
should govern our expenditures and

In oihr words Hio limltailon of tax

rR'iHiin of under vuluii loir, in pro
vioua years coiild no doubt if per
mined so tn do, create gieut cxirn
VHgnnco oven within the-authorized
rato of taxation, Hut to guard
against audi rimtiiigeiieles, t lie
legislature provided that no county
should bo permitted to levy a tux,
ovni though williiii li e limitation
an provided, which would produce
In the uggrcgnt'e an excess of reye
nue, over and above 'five per cent
moro thuii ihu nmount raised by
luxation during tho preceding years,
except upon approval of I ho State
Tax Commission which may be
made or hud upon n showing th.it
such oxcesiilve tax Is n necessity..
Tho present tax law is quite eins
Ho in its provisions; it seeks to
iinilllze the aovernl agencies of (lie
suite, the county assessor, theStali
Tor Commission and tho coiirtH to
the end that no stibjeot of taxation
ahull be Illegally or unjustly taxed
nor ahull any etitjcci of taxation
fail lo appear upon the tax rolls.
Tim assessor, in the first Instance
is expected to do his duty, IhcStatn
Tax Commission aro clothed with
power to rulso or dcereuso assess

be properly listed and assessed; to
fix tho valuation of livestock, fail

district court upon proper showing
and proof, without expenso to tho
taxpayer.
In addition to Hie matter relative
to luxation which I herotnfuro re
ferred to, tho legislature passed
what is generally known a?, the
"Mine Tax Output Law." The
question of properly estimating Hie
value of minerals and coals hidden
under the aurfaeo is one that for
veiirs has caused a grout deal of
disagreeable controversy in a ureal
