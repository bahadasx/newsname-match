"If this Senate Is going to "he pap.

rlorah shouted.
When order was restored Senutor
Stone explained that "on this resolu-.
ion I vote 'aye.'"
Thero was some uncertainty amonp
tome senators as to the status of the
.nriouB resolutions.
It was explained that Senator James
lad moved to lay not only the (lore
ivarnlng Resolutions but also the sorailed
corrected resolution on the
able. It was necessary then for seniors
to express themselves as to
varnings nnd on the quostion of the
tilling of an American on an unarmed
Merchantman as the cause for war in

For that reason. Senator Gore voted
;o table because he did not favor his
>wn substitute and had Introduced it
nerely to pet an expression of the
senate on that issue.
The text of Senator Gore's addition
o his original resolution was as folows:
"Resolved by the Senate, the
7ouse of Representative! concurring,
hat the sinking by a Getniun snbma ine
without notice or warning of an
irmed merchant vessel of her public

Several senators explained that the

pressed herself as being exceedingly;
pleased with her engagement here, arid'
feels thai the school has been quite worth
while. She has converted many
of the women to her Better Foods and
Better (Homes doctrine, and won many
friends both for herself and her cause.
The subject of good wholesome food
for the family, as she has presented It. jhas
been of great interest to tbc mothers
of thlB city, and in every way the j
course-has been exceptionally lnstruc;

"Must all I love on earth be* borne to
the grave?" iB the burden of a mournful
poem that she wrote at:the time
of her father's death.
Among her friends about her borne
on the Ith:ne?, "the little wild rosebud
of Wled" had evinced an almost
savage dislike to matrimony and had
often exclaimed: "I. do not want to
marry unless I can be queen of Ru- j
mania." The principality-of Rumen- '
ia had at that time just been found- '<
ed and there was no sense in the j
young princess's remark except that .
she believed it a sufficiently &afe way
to say that she didn't want to marry ,
at all. 1
There is.a remarkable romance at- ]
tached to the fact that some years-j i
later her suitor became Prince. ]
Charles of Hohenzollern, who was re- ]
fused on the same, fanciful pretext }
that the princess would not marry un- ]
less she could be Queen of Rumania, j
In 18C8, Prince Charles was chosen
ruler of Rumania, and in the autumn i
of the next year he returned to Wied. <
to. remind the Princess Elizabeth of
her desire to rule over'that kingdom.
Married and settled in the palace
at Bucharest, the Princess threw herself
with great ardor into tho life of
the country. She learned to read
and write Rumanian, mado herself .
acquainted with the needs and requirements
of, the land and became
so beloved that the people called her
"The Little 'Mother." Out of
her own private purse she
founded schools, hospitals and art
galleries, and devoted practically her
whole life, to philanthropy. Although
she had practiced her literary talents J
In a limited way tor many yearn,; It
wan not until the death of her first
and only child, at ;the nice' of fotjr,
