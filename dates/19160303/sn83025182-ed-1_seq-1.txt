[United Press Leased Wire Service]
WASHINGTON, March 3.—
The senate today formally gave
notice to the world that it
stands behind President
son.
By a vote of sixty-eight
fourteen, the senate voted
down Senator

off armed ships.
Gore's resolu-
Amid dramatic scenes, un
paralleled since the United
States declared war against
Spain, the"senate tabled Gore's
resolution, as requested by the
president.
By the signal record roll call the

resolution, but all amendments

The administration leaders were
ruthless today in giving the death
blow to the opposition to the presi

After the vote on the Gore resolu

The vote for the president includ

Wll-Amendment
Gore offered. Senators
considered that this would practically
amount to notice upon Germany that
war would be declared by the United
States upon the killing of a single
American by a submarine attacking a
merchantman without warning.
Gore's surprising and unexplained
eleventh hour move in offering what
was practically a new resolution and
an ultimatum to the central powere,
caused several senators to change
their votes.
Even Senator Vardaman who favor

Gore's amendment, that the killing
of an American citizen by a German
submarine would be a cause of war,
was according to the blind senator's
explanation, made later, in an at

an*|claims is the real one.

Stone, shaking his hand, and glar

"The senator from Idaho nor any
other senator can prevent me from

"I will and I am," shouted Borah,
loudly across the aisle, his objection
being sustained by the vice president.
Stone surrendered and voted against
Gore's substitute.

"A nation's honor should not hang

not too much to ask our citizens to

LONDON, March 3.—ThouQh they
refused full confirmation, admiralty
officials today Indicated that reports
that the submarine U-27 which sank
the Arabic, was later destroyed by a
British patrol boat, are correct.
The United Press today called the
admiralty's attention to fresh rumors
that the U-27 had been sunk shortly
after she sent the White Star liner
to the bottom on August 19.
"We do not deny the report," said
a responsible official. "We say noth
ing more."
[A few days after the Arabic was
sunk off the Irish coast by tne U-27,
reports came from both London and
Berlin that tho submarine had been
sunk by British patrol boats.
Ambassador Bernstorff, however,
reported to the American state de
partment Oct. 5, 1915, that the boat
had returned to its base and that on
the basis of a report made by Com
mander Schneider, Germany wished
to disavow the Arabic sinking.
A New York newspaper yesterday
quoted a high British official in this
country as authority for the state
ment that the U-2V was destroyed by
tne British. Two of her crew were
captured by the British, but died lat
er, it was stated.

foreign conflict to which it has been

at any time since the days of McKin
Iey, reached their climax at 11 o'clock
today when the senate met to give
notice to the world—and especially to
Germany—that a united congress and
nation stands behind President Wil
son.
Some of the senators undoubtedly
had been dragged up to their stand.
But the early count indicated that
when the vote is taken after what
promised to be brief debate, the
necessary number will have toed the
mark drawn by the president—a mark
plain enough to be seen by every
European chancellery.
Senate support of the president by
a vote of nearly 3 to 1 seemed as
sured.
The house will also go on record
favoring the president, possibly to
morrow, but probably by a smaller
vote. The senate proceedings today
were carefully framed in advance. The
administration was firmly In control,
but the non-partisan support of many
republicans wiped out partisan flavor
to the administration victory.
The final vote was to be taken after
a brief spech by Senator Gore. Okla

lution warning Americans to stay off
belligerent armed merchant vessels
and denying them passports.

[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
LONDON, March 3.—Storms of
artillery fire along the whole Verdun
front and vicious infantry actions
around Fort Douaumont have marked
the renewal of the German offensive.
According to one unconfirmed report
from Stockholm today, Field Marshal
Mackens«n, hero of the German Gal

I Berlin advices today admitted that
the soggy Woevre plain east and
southeast of Verdun has proved a
great hindrance to the movement of
heavy guns, thus explaining the loll
in the battle.
"But our troops are going forward
again", said a delayed Berlin dis
patch.
Practically all the Berlin corres
pondents whose dispatches have
reached London, pay tribute to the
work of the French gunners though
they claim superiority for their own
artillery.
"As our troops advanced, a terrible
fire from some distant French flank
ing batteries laid a checkerboard pat
tern of bursting shells on the ground,'*
wired one German correspondent, re
porting the attack on Hill 344.
"Through this our troops stormed
with indescribable defiance .of death
until they at last reached the top or

"The worst was yet to come. The
French now laid a fierce concentric
fire upon this important hill, posses
sion of which was decisive for both
sides. The German troops in this
manner were cut off for two days as
on an Island and forced to hold out
without food. Despite this disad
vantage these heroes beat off violent

war. Party lines were wiped out.
Republican leaders and the rank and
liie lined up with political foes In tne
America union to keep American
peace.
The house will be called upon at
once, possibly tomorrow to go on
record also.
The foreign affairs committee this
afternoon was to take final action re
garding a warning resolution for the
showdown vote desired by the presi
dent.
Leaders, democratic and republican,
today declared the house also would
give the president its endorsement
by defeating a resolution of warning.
The vote today In the senate was
not technically upon the merits of
the proposition to warn Americans.
It reached greater depths. While
the vote was to be merely upon tab
ling—killing—the Gore resolution
without actually voting upon the warn
ing plan Itself, the real vote was upon
showing Europe's belligerents wheth
er congress repudiates or sustains
President Wilson's stand, insisting
upon no abridgement, in any meas
ure, of any American right on the
high seas, express or implied.
When the senate convened it was
uncertain whether a second vote
would be taken on the resolutions of
Senator Jones.
Administration leaders said Jones'
resolution should be called up with
its non-partisan defeat practically as
certain as that facing the Gore reso
lution. At the very hour the senate
began it** deliberations, the president
and his cabinet assembled. No diplo
