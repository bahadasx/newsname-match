URGES MORE CURE
II (Me SPUDS
ONE OF MOST PROFITABLE
CROPS. POTATOES ARE ALSO
MOST NEGLECTED.
By R. L. Dalton,
Of the State Department of Agricul
ture.
The potato crop of Washington is
one of the most profitable crops pro
duced, yet the most neglected. Ex
cepting two or three districts of the
state, potato culture has ever been,
and yet is, a side issue with the
growers. They are planted not from
a standpoint of profit but as a filler
for home consumption, and as a rule
proper cultivation and the necessary
care are not practiced, as a result of
which there is a perceptible reduction
in yield. And yet, despite these
facts confronting us, during 1915 of
all agricultural crops produced in
Washington the potato crop ranked
third. Approximately eight and one
half millions of bushels were pro
duced, which brought nearly four and
one-half millions of dollars, and yet
this supply was inadequate, as -thou
sands of tons were shipped in from
Other states and Canada.
In Western Washington,
little attention other than planting is
given this crop, the average yield per
acre is from four to six tons. Othei
localities where every attention pos
sible is given and every scientific
method employed for profitable pro
duction, the average yield is about
12 tonß per acre, with an average
price of sl2 per ton at digging time.
Figuring on a basis of 12 tons per
acre, the actual cost of production is
approximately S4O, which leaves a
net margin of pver SIOO per acre to
the grower.
Diseases.
The potato of Washington is sub
ject to some diseases, of which blight,
blackleg and brown rot are tM most
serious. In many instances, unless
methods are employed to combat
them, these diseases sometimes mean
a total loss.
Thar are easily controlled pro-
Tided proper precaution la taken for
tbelr control. Late blight is caused
by a funfcus, pbytopbtbora infeatana,
which lives over winter in a more or
leaa dormant condition aa a thread
like growth in the decayed areaa of
tubers and in the soil where
infected potatoes bad been grown
during preceding years. It is there
fore imperative that clean seed be
planted in clean soil, soil free from
Infestation.
It is doubtful that subsequent con
trol of late blight fungus can be
brought about by dipping seed pota
toes in a formaldehyde solution or
corrosive sublimate solution, there
fore it is of the highest Importance
that great care be exercised, in tbe
selection of seed for planting that it
be as free as possible from disease.
As a precaution against blackleg
and scab, the seed should be treated
before cutting by soaking for two
hours in a solution of formaldehye
made by diluting one pint of 40 per
cent formaldehyde In 30 gallons of
water, or one and one-half hours in
a solution of corrosive sublimate
made by dissolving four ounces of
the poison in 30 gallons of water.
The plants should be thoroughly
sprayed at intervals of two weeks with
Bordeaux mixture 6-6-50 from the
time they are eight inches high until
growth has ceased. This mixture
properly applied prevents late blight,
checks early blight, lessens the loss
from brown rot, stimulates the plant
and increases the yield.
Varieties and Grading.
There are two serious mistakes
that growers of Western Washington
make. One is, they insist on plant
ing too many varieties. This practice
precludes obtaining orders for car
load lots which the present market
demands. One commercial variety
for each district is sufficient, by
which means, quantity lots can easily
be obtained at an increased price.
Let each community indorse one
good commercial variety and stick
to it, and soon that*eommunity will
become known to the trade and buy
ers will seek business, but under
present conditions the Western
Washington potato Is a drug on the
market.
The second mistake, and one which
the grower must eventually correct,
is in the grading. It is as essential

SUES GILLIES FOR $5,022.
State Seeks to Replenish Industrial
Insurance Fund, by New Action.
Accompanied by affidavits by As
sistant Attorney John M. Wilson and
his assistant, Glenn Fairbrook, that
they believe Gillies has $2,000 in
cash and valuable jewelry in a safe
deposit box at Talcott's Jewelry store,
suit was filed by the state in the local
superior court this week against J.
F. Gillies and wife to collect $5,-
022.65, which is alleged to be the
amount Gillies personally took from
the industrial insurance funds.
The suit follows the second convic
tion of Gilllea for complicity in loot
ing the industrial funds, and covers
only five of the 17 fraudulent claims
upon which the looters are said to
have realised some SIB,OOO or $20,-
000. The state seeks, in this suit, to
recover this amount to recompense
the department fund.
OH OPERATES PLANT
Olympia Now Carrying on Business
Active control and management of
the Olympia waterworks were as
sumed by the municipality this week,
the offices of the company having
been moved from the location occu
pied for years at Third and Columbia
streets to the city clerk's office on
the second floor of the city hall, a
councilmanlc Committee placed in
general charge, and Street Superin
tendent E. A. McClarty as manager
of the operating and construction de
partment. March bills being
paid to the city.
No announcement was made by
city officials this week as to any
changes in the policy of the company,
though Superintendent McClarty
stated that he was engaged in mak
ing a survey and map of the system,
one purpose of it being to ascertain
if, as he suspects, there are some 25
or 30 customers using the company's
water and not paying for it. Mc-
Clarty, before he became street su
perintendent, was employed by the
company In its operating and con
struction department and is quite
familiar with the system.

down the price, while the graded lot
commands the highest market price.
Considering tbe magnitude of this

profit derived therefrom and the
growing market demand for a home

"Hew to the Line, Let the Chips Fall Where they May."
OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, MARCH 3, 1916.
FOSHAY'S LOCAL CREDITORS "HOLD THE SACK"
OWNERS OF FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS ONLY ONES WHO WILL
REALIZE IN FULL FROM SALE OF WATERWORKS TO CITY—
PORTLAND PROMOTER FAILED IN ALL HIS LOCAL ENTER
PRISES.
Olympia business men who sold
quantities of merchandise, sup
plies and construction materials to
the Foshay enterprise, the Washing
ton Public Service company, former
owner of the Olympia waterworks
which passed into the control of the
city this week, will realise nothing
whatever on their claims against the
concern, the only creditors of the
waterworks system who will realize
in full being the holders of the $65,-
000 Arts mortgage zonds, according
to the best information available as
to the involved finances of the com
pany.
The city got clear title to the con
cern when it paid $102,500 into the
registry of the Pierce county supe
rior court. Of this total, approxi
mately $65,000 will go to the first
mortgage bondholders, for whom the
Harris Savings & Trust company is
trustee. In addition to this, some
$13,000 must be paid in delinquent
taxes, SI,OOO returned to customers
who made deposits to obtain meters,
$1,700 as the company's assessment
on the Swantown sewer, and $2,000
for general expenses under the re
ceivership, making a total of approx
imately $83,000.
In addition to' the $102,500 paid
by the city, the company will have
$1,500 on hand after all February
aOcounts are paid, or $104,000 alto
gether. Deducting the $83,000 there
1B left some $21,000 to apply on, the
second mortgage bonds, amounting
to $70,000, upon which there is also
some accrued interest. Thus less
than a third of these bonds can be
paid, and nothing at all will be left
for the creditor! of the Voshay con
cern. x
H. C. Heermans, former owner of
the waterworks who disposed of it
to Wilbur B. Foshay, the Portland
promoter, Is reported to own the
largest portion of the second mort
gage bonds, of which the Northwest
Trust at Savings company of Seattle
it trustee. This Is the company
which instituted the action in the
local superior court last November
that threw the company Into the
hands of a receiver.
The Steam-Heating Plant.
Not all of the claims held by local
business men as general creditors
against the foshay concern, the
Washington Public Service company,
arose from goods purchased for the
water system. Many of them were
due to supplies and materials ad
vanced for the other local Foshay en
terprise, the electric power and cen
tral steam-heating plant in which
Millard Lemon of this city was at
first associated with Foshay. Six
teen or 18 months ago Lemon sued
Foshay for approximately SIB,OOO
for money he had put into the enter
prise. The Martin Hardware com
pany also sued Foshay for some
$1,200, while the Olympia Hardware
company is a creditor to the extent
of several hundred dollars. This
firm last fall was able to realize
various sums on this indebtedness
when it brought a series of suits
against/ the company, garnisheeing
water bills due it, until it was

stopped by the receivership proceed
ings.
A considerable part of the steam
heating plant was constructed during
the early months of the Foshay
regime in this city, and mains were
laid throughout the greater part of
the business district. The American
District Steam Heating company, a
New York state firm, supplied the
greater portion of the material for
the project, and is reported to have
a claim of $25,000 or $30,000
against the company. The brick
building which the plant was to oc
cupy stands on the Carlyon fill on
property adjoining that of the Olym
pia Door company.
Foshay's Local History.
Foshay, who was at one time con
nected with the Washington-Oregon
corporation as manager of its prop
erties at Centralia and then Vancou
ver, Wash., had a spectacular career
in Olympia. When he came here in
1912 he was connected in a manage
rial capacity with the Northwestern
Electric company of Portland and he
managed to group about him a num
ber of local business men through
whose assistance he obtained fran
chises from the city council for a
waterworks system and an electric
and steam-heating plant, after a vig
orous campaign. Then he acquired
the waterworks system from H. C.
Heermans, a little while later Mayor
Mottman's first special election cam
paign for a municipally owned water
system was Instituted, and Foshay's
troubles began.
Thing* drifted along from bad to
worse, other special elections were
held, the water question was con
stantly agitated, the financial situa
tion was such that Foshay could not
float any bonds, a low valuation was
placed on the property after con
demnation proceedings, and the
Foshay enterprises finally winked
out, though not until he had made
another effort last summer to reha
bilitate them, through new fran
chises granted by the city, including
a lighting contract with the city add
provisions permitting the city to take
over the projected plants on a stipu
lated basis. Foshay was given three
months in which to "make good" on
this deal, but could not, and the re
ceivership proceedings followed
shortly after.
Foshay in Minneapolis.
Foshay left Portland early in the
winter and has since been employed
by a concern in Minneapolis, Minn.
Friends say he lost considerable
money which he put into his local en
terprises and also considerable Port
land property, which was heavily
mortgaged. C. A. Harmony, who
was manager of the water system
under the Foshay regime but who,
unlike Foshay, is quite popular in
Olympia, has not decided what he
will do, though he has several prop
ositions in view.
The history of the local water sys
tem, particularly the financial side
of it, is highly involved, first with the
issuance of stock, then one bond
issue and another. The company
was organized and the system in
stalled during the "boom times" a
little more than 25 years ago. Its
career has been a stormy one.
SELL ALL BLACKBERRIES.
Puyallup Association Disposes of En
tirelOlO Output for 970.000.
So heavy have been the demands
in other parts of the country for the
blackberries canned by the Puyallup
%
and Sumner Fruit Growers' associa-
tion, that the entire output for 1916,
amounting to $76,000, has already
been contracted for, says the Puyal
lup Valley Tribune. Even greatei
amounts could have been sold in ad
vance had the local market and can
ning facilities been able to supply the
need, Mr. Paulhamus said.
"We've got orders for the entire
berry supply," said Mr. Paulhamus,
"and we could have sold a great deal
more. The output that has already
been contracted for amounts to about
3,500,000 pounds. The blackberry
business is on a very good basis."

authorities since the state went dry.
Quimby Seeks Tornow Reward.
Recalling the long hunt for John
Tornow, the outlaw of the Olympics,
a suit was filed in the local superior
court this week by Giles Quimby, the
deputy sheriff who killed Tornow,
for the reward of SI,OOO posted by
Governor Hay. Quimby has already
been paid the reward offered by
Gray'B Harbor (then Chehalis) coun
ty, but was refused the state reward
on the ground that he was a deputy
sheriff. He contends, however, that
he became a special deputy after the
reward was posted for the sole pur
pose of running down Tornow.
