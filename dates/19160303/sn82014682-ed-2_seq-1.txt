The many friends of Miss Christina

be 'glad to hear that she has been the
recipient of signal honors at the hands
of Belgium's queen, and is performing
a great and noble work In that war-
torn; lindV .' ,''
Miss Hunter was one of four nurse
sent from Honolulu shortly after the
outbreak of the hostilities In Europe,
and ever since has been at the battle
fronts. , Writing to an intimate friend
here ah says:
"I am located in the hospital nearest
of all to the trenches that they allow
women to get to, and I have the satis
faction of knowing that none of the
other sisters has beaten me in this
privilege of getting experience. We

My present ist Is in a field hos

UP AT MIDNIGHT;
Land Commissioner Tucker's term
expires at midnight tonight and there
is an air of h.ush and expectation
around the departments at the capitol
today. The governor's intention of
displacing Tucker Is an open secret
and the main curiosity is as to the de1
tails, in view of Tucker's persistent
refusal to resign and get out before
his term should expire. ; .
The land commissioner was not at
his office today. He has been absent
a good deal lately and recently, said
capitol observers, has - not seen the
governor. It is definitely expected
that matters will come to a climax
this afternoon or tonight and also that
by tomorrow the governor's choice of
a successor will become known. Ru
mor ' continues to , place Bertram G.
RIvenburgh as the leading possibility
for the land office, and In Democratic
circles It is reported that William E.
Miles will be his duty. If so, the new
line-up will bring together two former
private secretaries to the late Demo
cratic mayor, for RIvenburgh served
two terms as J. J. Fern's secretary
and Miles followed him In the city
hall Job. :.

John Lucas, president and manager

of the former ahesia, : which were of

a rmieh estimate? on the actual fire
damage at somewhere between $10,o00
and $12000, with an addltlonaF loss of
$10,000. from contracts which he will
be unable to carry through as planned.
Insurance to the amount of $5000 or
$6000 was carried on the burned por
tion, which Mr. Lucas said today was
not insured as. high as tne rroni oi

surance of $20,000. ' 81

"The damage is to the most produc
tive part of the mill, however," said
Mr. Lucas, "and It will be hard to es
timate the resultant loss by being un
able to fulfil certain of our contracts.
'Besides large amounts of lumber
and the mill structure itself destroyed
there are many portions of; the ma
chinery, belting and shafting, band
saws, a sandpaper machine of much
value, carpenter shop, store room and
tools." :-:
Mr. Lucas gave orders to keep mov

morning, and work started soon in he

also contains much machinery. . Mean

saw the blaze first he thought It was
a pile of rubbish, but ; realized soon
after that the mill was on fire.
Central station engines and hose

Gone Before Alarm Came.
"The structure was practically gone
before the alarm reached us fir3t,"
said Fire Chief Thurston today, "and
as we left the station at Fort and
Beretanla we could see the reflection
from the flames lighting up the sky.
"It was a real fire," declares the
chief, "one of the biggest we have
had in a long while. The new en
gines worked beautifully in this first
big tryout, in fact they saved the day
and kept it from being worse."
The new building, which will be
fireproof , and larger,, with arrange
ments under, the most modern fash
ion, will be made of concrete,' accord
ing to Mr. Lucas. The company has
been In its present quarters since
1878. Three or four small fires have
occurred before, but with little dam

The president's piicy of standing for the right of ncutraI5 to trav

fight in the senate against thej pi esident was badly beaten. f
By a vote of 68 to 14, a greater majority than had been expected by
the president's supporters and the administration forces, the senate
tabled the resolution offered by Senator Gore of Oklahoma which-in
substance would warn Americans not to travel on armed belligerent
ships. By- this action the senate puts the quietus on the senate agita

The president today told congressional leaders that it was monthj
after Bryan's resignation before the United States was able to convince
Germany that Americans are in earnest in their position rgarding sub

that Congress could further weaken the position of the United States
abroad by ill-advised action now. 'v ,-- v : .
