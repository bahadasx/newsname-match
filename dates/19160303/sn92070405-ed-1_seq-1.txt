NEW BUSINESS HOUSE
Contrary to the original plana of
the owner to build a frame build
ing between the Star Theater and
Mrs.' Steven's on Railroad avenue,
a modern business house with a
brick fire wall adjoining the thea
ter was begun by Contractor Jack
Heather on Tuesday. There will
be two store rooms in the build
ing, 90 feet long. Through the ef
forts of John T. Muir to promote
the general welfare of Lordsburg
the brick wall was decided upon.
It is expected that the building
will be up within 30 days.
W. H. Small received plans and
specifications Tuesday for his
modern two story brick business
house that is to be erected adjoin
ing the Star theater on the east, on
Railroad avenue. It is planned to
begin this building at once and
when completed it will be the fin
est in Lordsburg.
AU REVOIR
Joe Nygren, former manager of
the drug department of the Eagle
Drug Mercantile Company, left
Tuesday morning for Douglas,
Ariz., where he has accepted a res
ponsible position with the Doug
las Drug Co. All Lordsburg re
Igrets to learn of his denartnre.
Joe has been foremost in every
public enterprise and has been a
big asset to this city. On Monday
night an informal farewell party
was held at the Nygren home for
Mr. and Mrs. Nygren and a large
crowd gathered to bid Joe good
bye. Several musical numbers
were rendered by Miss Garrett, Mr.
and Mrs. Spink, the Messrs. Nead,
Dr. Crocker, Matt Mansfield, Miss
Mary Beam, Miss Trimble and Joe
Nygren, with choruses by every
one. The only regrettable part of
the evening was the "adiosing" to
Joe.
STROUER WILL FIGHT FARGO
Larry Strouer, the iron soldier,
is now training at Faywood Hot
Springs for his bout with Kid Far
go, which Comes off at Tyrone on
March 10th. Both these boys are
fighters from the first bell to the
last one, and the bout should be a
hummer. They have both fought
here and have shown they have the
class, and as each one of them has
been piling up a string of straight
victories lately this meeting should
give the dopesters something to
figure about. Each of them is
confident of winning and has no
hesitation in saying so.

COURT BEGINS MONDAY
What promises to be the busiest
term of the district court held in
Silver City in many year will be
gin Monday, with Judge Colin Neb
lett, of the Sixth Judicial Dis
trict presiding. The coming term
will be featured by the trial of sev
eral important murder cases, since
about seven prisoners are in cus
tody, charged with this offense and
their cases will be presented to
the grand jury with a view to se
curing their indictment.
Chief among those who are
charged with murder are Lucius
C. Hightower, accused of shooting
and killing his wife at Tyrone, No
vember 30, 1915; T. G. Alsup,
charged with having shot to death
Roy Gibbs at Fierro, on Decem
ber 13, 1915; Pete Montes, charged
in Silver City on January 7, this
year; Crescensio Molina, accused
of causing the death of Belle Mon
toya, on the Mimbres, December
13, 1915; George Carlson, a sol
dier of the border patrol, alleged
slayer of John White, a fellow sol
dier at Hachita, ten days ago, and
several others.
The county jail is more than
comfortably filled with prisoners,
there being upwards of 70 in cus
tody awaiting the convening of the
grand jury, while a number are out
on bond. This is the largest num
ber of prisoners confined in the
Grant county jail in several years.
The sheriff's office has been
busy the past two weeks serving
summons on prospective grand and
petit jurors for service at the
forthcoming court term.
PLAN A PERSONAL
ALLOWANCE TRIP
Autoists from Douglas, Bisbee,
Clifton, Morenci and other dry
points in Arizona are planning a
motorcade to Lordsburg to secure
their allowance of liquors as pres
cribed by the high courts of Ari
zona, which is: One case of whis
ky, one barrel of beer, and a jug of
wine. The Attorney General of
Arizona has been asked to go on
the trip to see that the allowance
was not overstepped.
Inclement weather prevented the
trip but as soon as the sun comes
out nice again it will doubtless be
made. The local refreshment es
tablishments are stocking up for
the event.

MINES AND MINING
STEINS MINES
An important discovery of bron-
zite has been made in the eastern
foothills of the Peloncillo moun
tains, about seven miles south of
Steins Pass, New Mexico, by J.
M. McKenzie, E. Waller McKen
zie, and Linsey Darrow of San Si
mon, Ariz., says the El Paso Times.
They have brought a carload of ore
from their Stockton group in the
same district to El Paso. Mr. Mc
Kenzie, sr., is a cattleman and fol
lows mining incidentally.
lhe bronzite occurs in a fissure
vein ten feet wide. The samples
have a bright golden appearance,
and might easily be mistaken for
the yellow metal and are being an
alyzed by Johnson and Anthony of
EI Paso to determine if they do
not actually carry gold. Bronzite
is a variety of enstatite, often of a
bronze-like luster. It is a silicate
of magnesia and iron, and of he
pyroxene family. It is used in
gilding picture frames for decora
tive purposes, and is classed as one
of the rare metals.
There is considerable mining ac
tivity in the mountains south of
Steins Pass, all the way north from
Granite Gap to the Southern Paci
fic railroad, according to Mr. Mc
Kenzie. The Stockton group is be
ing developed, and is producing
copper ore, containing both glance
and carbonates. John Moffitt and
D. L. Creswell are working the
South Virginia claim on the west
side of the Peloncillo range, due
west of the Stockton group, and
today are shipping another car of
high grade copper ore. 'Their
shipments average 6 percent cop
per, and the ore is being shipped
to the El Paso smelting works.
The November Mining claim is
also working a considerable force
of men and has just shipped a car
of 65 tons of silver-lead ore to the
El Paso smelter. W. H. Kinnon
is general manager. North, of
Steins Pass is the El Oro group
and the National Mines Company's
gold and silver mines are being de
veloped.
At Steeple Rock
The water in the Carlisle mine
has been lowered to the 500. foot
level during the week, and it will
be but a short time before the
mine is entirely drained. All that
remains to be drained is the 500
foot level, a winze sunk from that
level and about 1,100 of drifts
In the process of unwatering the
mine a pump was uncovered on
the 300 foot level which had been
under water for 27 years, and
stranee as it may seem, it is in
eood condition and operated when
the steam was turned into it, says
the Duncan News.
Arrangement are being made
for the beginning of active min
ing operations in the near future.
Comparatively little repair work
is necessary under ground, as the
timbers are all in excellent con
dition.
A rich zinc strike was recently
made at the Zinc King mine at
Bullard s peak, ten miles from
Red Rock by Cieorge W. bpencer,
who has been operating that pro
perty for some time. A 10 foot
vein was recently encountered in
a cross-cut tunnel at a depth of
100 feet, which proved to be solid
ore assaying u per cent zinc
besides gold and silver. The for
mation is a porphyry quartz. The
property has been developed by
three tunnels and considerable
work has been done with excel
lent results. Duncan News.
WELDON MAKES STRIKE
Frank Weldon and associates
who are working the Nellie Gray
mine, well known here as the "Mol-
lie s Dream , when it was located
by Chris Yeager, made one of the
biggest strikes in the camp Wed
nesday when they uncovered
blind ledge several feet wide av
eraging 30 percent copper with
good silver and gold values. The
strike has caused a rush to tha
Bonney district.
Lister, Aker and Stephens, who
are working nearby claims under
bond from Mr. Crist of Beioit,
Wis., have shipped their first car
load of ore. The values are ex
ceedingly high and the vein is
widening with depth. All indica
tion point to their property as a
"comer."
. GOLD STRIKE
It is reported that an improtant
gold strike was made by Charles
R. Smith and George Kayden in an
old prospect hole four miles north
of the Volcano mine at Steins. A
rush is being made to that section.
Manager Briel of the Star thea
ter is having new scenery painted
for his stage, a new movie screen
installed, and a fireproof ad
vertising curtain made by an art
ist who arrived here Monday. .
Lordsburg Ore Shipments
. Increase 116 Per Cent
George R. Drysdale, auditor and
treasurer of the Arizona and New
Mexico Railroad, was here last
Saturday en route to Clifton from
Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he
appeared before the State tax
commission for his company pro
testing against a raise in taxes.
That ore shipments from the
Lordsburg district increased 116
per cent in 1915, or from 1,531,137
ton miles in 1914 to 8,307,814 ton
miles last year was an interesting
fact disclosed by Mr. Drysdale
at the opening session of the State
tax commission.
The ore shipments in question
were made almost entirely by the
85 MiningCompany, the second
most important copper producer
in the btate. A branch line to
the 85 Mine was built by the
Arizona and New Mexico railroad
last year.
Mr. Drysdale appeared before
the commission to prote&t against
the raise of $380.510 in the valua
tion of the Arizona & New Mexico
railroad, decreed by the tax com
mission at its November meeting,
and to ask that a reduction be
granted. His request for a re
duction was based principally on
the fact that for nearly five
months, beginning September 11,
1914, the three big copper com
panies' of the Clifton district of
Arizona, which this company
serves, were tied up by a strike,
as a result of which, according to
his statement, not a pound of
ore was mined or smelted by any
of the companies, and the freight
business normally created by these
companies ceased absolutely.
Mr. Drysdale said that the com
panies affected by the strike
the Shannon, Detroit and Arizona
--contributed, during the fiscal
year ending June 30, last, 74.36
per cent ot the total business
handled by the Arizona and New
Mexico railroad, the 85 Mine in
the Lordsburg district of New
Mexico contributing 19.1)2 per
cent of the tonnage.
A Coming Treat
Too much praise cannot be
given manager Brial for engaging
the Schubert soloists of Chicago,
to appear here on Thursday, 16th
of March, at the Star Iheatre

in all the principal cities of the
North American continent to need
any introduction to readers of
The Western Liberal.
Cattle Deal
Another big cattle deal was
made in Duncan last Saturday,
when W. W. Wilkey purchased
one-half interest in the cattle
owned by G. E. Head and W. F,
Willis, Mr. Wilkey buying the
interest of Mr. Head. The con
sideration is said to have been
$20,000. The new owner took
immediate possession. Duncan

MINSTREL SHOW
A GRAND SUCCESS
Everyone and his neighbor turn
ed out Saturday night to witness
the first performance of the Coon
town Minstrels of Lordsburg in
their hilarious and excellent pre
sentation at the Star theater. It
was a glorious success in every
way and nothing ever presented
on the local thespian platform ever
made more of a hit.
The theater was packed and
crowded long before the show be
gan and the box office receipts
showed the band to be again on a
sound financial basis.
The show started off with the
usual circle, Nat Gammon presid
ing as interlocutor and Harry Fo
ley ano Matt Mansfield as end
men. Ihey gave some hot shots
that brought down the house. Mid
way the end men retired in favor
of Sam Gass and Wm. Tyra, who
kept the audiences entertained
with laughs at the rate of a mile
a minute. The delivery was good
and the jokes brand new. During
the first act the following musical
renditions were given: "Tulip
Time in Holland," by John Crow
ell; "Put Your Arms Around Me,
Honey," by Wm. Tyra; "I'm on my
Way to Dixie," by Matt Mansfield:
"The Anvil Song," by Dr. M. M.
Crocker; "A Little Bit of Heaven,"
oy joe JNygren; "Dixie Kid," by
Fay Nygren; and the wind-up,
"Kentucky Jubilee," by Sam Gass.
Hiach song was jnven in a most
pleasing manner, with the chorus
by the entire company. The en
cores were deafening.
A dialogue with a beautv cho
rus was given between Acts 1 and
2, ending with the "Barbers' Ball"
chorus. Between Acts 2 and 3
Prof. Nead sang and played the
"Nigger Blues" and Wm. Tyra gave
a colored suffrasret monologue
Both made a decided hit with the
audience and received hearty ap
plause.
The "Incorporation of Coon
town" followed with a burlesque
Lordsburg band" that received
the generous approval of the au
dience. The joKes in the "Incor
poration" sketch were all localized
and took the audience off their
feet. Every member of the com
pany had an important part and
handled it much to the delight of
the spectators. Joe Nygren and
frot. .Nead played a saxonhone
duet which demanded several repe
titions from the big crowd. Miss
Fay Nygren sang a most pleasing
solo and the Crocker, Mansfield,
Gass, Nygren uuartet all contend
ed for first honors. The sketch
captivated the audience and made
one of the biggest hits of the even
ing. .
The finale was a sketch, "The
Manager's Trials," in which some
of Lordsburg's best material show
ed the trials of a theatircal mana
ger in securing competent mem-
ters for his company. Joe Nygren
andled the part of the manager in
a talented way and one in which
he was perfectly at home. W. N.
Tyra played the part of "Sunflow
er", the office boy, much to the de
light of all, and Matt Mansfield in
the character of "Orlando Tat
ters", the has-been actor, was a
scream. Miss Mary Beam made a
decided hit as Mademoiselle De
Limbre, a French dancer. She han-,
died her part with the ease becom
ing one of a long experience on the
stage. Miss Dordthy. Chase as
Udoxe Persimmons, an old maid,
took a hard portrayal with grace-

fulness. She sent the audience in
to convulsions and got a big slice
of the evening's applause. Bob
Reynolds capably represented "Sis
sy Dever", an effeminate theatri
cal aspirant, and Harry Foley as
"Fritz Dinkelspiel," was a howling
success. When Harry sang "Ach
du Lieber Augustine" he was a
sure cure for the blues. Red Mc-
Elgin wound up the show by most
dramatically arresting "Bill Scrap
per, who was none other than
Sam H. Gass. Mr. Gass held up
his end of the sketch in profes
sional style.
Besides those already mention
ed the following helped make the
show the big success it was:
Misses Inez Trimble, L0Í3 Lock
lear, Rachel Robson, Mrs. W. N.
Tyra, Mrs. H. S. Spink, Messrs.
Hefflin, Ownby, Spink and W. C.
Nead.
The orchestra pieces preceed-
ing the performance were treats of
the evening.
All m all the show was not to
be excelled. Every member of the
big company is to be highly com
plimented. It is trusted that the
show will be repeated when those
who did not obtain seats Saturday
night may have a chance to witness
it.
