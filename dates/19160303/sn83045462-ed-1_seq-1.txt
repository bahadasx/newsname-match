Meeting at National Rifles'

SAMUEL GOMPERS SLATED
AS PRINCIPAL SPEAKER
J. Edwin Giles Declares That Government
Employes Have the
Eight to Unionize.
I. Edwin Wiles. president of the
Office Workers' I'nion of Washington.
which i> affiliated with,
the American Federation of
Labor, today announced that till
plans have been completed for the
big mass meeting to be held tonight
at National Rifles' Armory
by organized labor, in its attempt
to defeat tile Borland rider
pending in the I louse of Representatives
which seeks to increase
*
the limit"-; ol labor ? > government
employes without additional pay.
Samuel (iompers will he the
principal speaker.
Mr. Giles made public a statement today,
in connection with plans for the
mass meeting. designed to correct the
impression which he says has unfortunately
"and wrongly" obtained circulation
that government employes are not
allowed to become members of labor
unions. Mr. Giles said that every government
worker in Washington, as well
as the members of labor organizations
generally, will be welcomed at National
Rifles Hall tonight, and that not only
is there nothing in the laws of the
United States to prevent their taking
part in a labor meeting, but he asserts
that the laws specifically give government
clerks and other employes the
right to form unions.
Such organization, ho said, would be
a sure deterrent to any future action
along the lines of the present effort to
increase the hours of labor of government
employes without corresponding
increase in pay.
Effect of '-Mistaken Idea."
"These mistaken ideas of the clerks
a lone stand in the way of the immediate
organization of the strongest sort
of a union," Mr. Giles said. "But we
are going ahead just the same, for we
have been assured by the labor leaders
in Congress that the Borland amendment
will l?e doomed if we do our part
in the campaign against its enaction."
President Gompers and Secretary
Morrison of the American Federation
of Labor also have been giving their
personal attention to the matter and
both will speak before tonight's meeting.
Others who will be called on for
remarks are President John 11. Ferguson
ot the Maryland State and District
of Columbia Federation of Labor, and
Thomas H. Flaherty of the National
Federation of Post office Clerks.
Various Organizations Protest.
Protests against the proposed action
from various organizations throughout
the District continue to be voiced. The
federated branches of the National
League of Government Fmployes. meeting
in special session at. Hotel Manhattan,
unanimously adopted a resolution declaring
.
We are opposed to the attempted legislation
known as the Boralnd rider, increasing
by one hour the working day of
government clerks, for the reason that if
enacted it will result in decreased efficiency
in the working machinery of the
executive departments of the government
and impose unnecessary hardships on
Liitrnc i.i n hi in
Branches No. ?S and I were represented
at the meeting of the league
last night, which was presided over by
George L. fain, president of the National
L'-ast'uc of < Jovernriicnt 15mployes.
The resolution wa.-- submifted
r*y K. \V. Jtoe. prescient or the Washington
federateu branches. and passed
almost without discussion.
Would Hamper University Work.
I'resident Charles H Mtobkton of
George Washington University states
that the passage of the "rider" would
seriously affect the university, requiring
a complete change in schedules
and greater expenditures for additional
instructors. v
"About TO per cent of our students
are in the government or have private
employment" President Stockton said,
"and these attend the late afternoon
classes froin to 7. It is easy to understand.
therefore, that jf the government
hours are prolonged ii would
mean the changing of these classes to
night classes and the hiring of an additional
corps of instructors. This
would increase the to it. ion a id would
be a great hardship to those who are
now obtaining a college education
through their own endeavors."
Action by Garrett Park Citizens.
The citizens of "larrett Park, .Mil.,
after -meeting in a public assembly
Wednesday have framed a resolution
urging the senators and representatives
from Maryland to do all in their
power to defeat the "rider." The resolution
claims that the Borland proposition
proposes to reduce the salaries
of the employes affected more than L'0
per cent as a result of the increase in
hours of labor without a corresponding
increase in pay.
The resolution further sets forth
that the "chuiigts in depart mental conditions
such as contemplated by the
Borland amendment make the public
service less desirable and less attractive
to persons possessing the qualifications
which should be found in government
employes," and that "a serious
effect of the provision under discussion
would be to disrupt the whole
social and business life of Washington;
yet this radical measure is proposed to
the House of Reepresentatives without
serious consideration, without the
recommendation of a single responsible
administrative oMiciai. and without .giving
those who would be most affected
b\ the legislation an opportunity to be
heard in their own behalf."
Samuel Gompers Commended.
A resolution also was unanimously
passed commending "the efforts of
I'resident Samuel < tampers and his associates
on the executive committee of
the American Federation of L?abor to
prevent the increase in the hours of
labor of the executive departments at
i Washington."
PASSPORTS DENIED

j ? trie resolution askc<1 the Secretary
of State to furnish information regarding
orders that, have been promulgated
from the State Department regarding
the issuance of passports; the other
asked the Secretary of the Treasury
for all the facts concerning the guns
on armed merchantmen which have
cleared from American ports within the
past sixty days.
The second resolution also asks
"what orders relative to the use of the
armament, either from the owners or
the belligerent governments, were carried
by the masters of such vessels."
The statement l>i Representative
MondeiI was:
Difficult to Get Passport.
"The administration talks of the
I abridgment of the l ights of American
j citizen*. So far as that goes, the ad!
ministration has been abridging the
rights of Americans to travel at sea
! for several months. If is exceedingly
! difficult to get a passport from the
State Department. Unless you are a
friend of the administration, or can
show that your business is of the most
extreme importance, you cannot get
ia passport. American citizens desiring
to go abroad, 1 understand, have been
turned down by the thousands. You
are put through a most rigid examinaj

on the sea, although the administration

that his request was genuine. They

jthat his mother was sick in Ireland. I
desire to know while the administration
is talking about the 'abridgment of
American rights,' how many Americans
have been denied their rights by the
s.rbitrary refusal of the State Departj

Administration lenders in the Mouse
arc hopeful that it will br unnecessary
to report a resolution in a rule.
It is taken for granted that republicans
would fight such a rule, and with

It would also be a setback to the
President to have him to turn to the

in foreign affairs, it is argued.
Mr. i'ou lias told members of the

and for that reason there will

Pro-German Influence Felt.
Jt was evident during the day that
pro-German influence was agitating
strongly in favor of a motion in both

them that motions to table would not

I Some of the President's friends
{strongly urged that he accept nothing

I that would leave no doubt how the
legislative branch of the government
fee-Is.
They wondered why he would accept
a vote to table in the Senate, which is
strongly with him. and insist upon a
straight vote in the House, where his
opponents are much stronger. The only
explanation appeared to be that the
President absolutely knows what to
expect in the Senate in the future,
while in the House lie would not wish
to have the legislative condition left
where it could again be called up or
to have a vote that would not be accepted
by the country as final or definite.

As the roll was about to be called.!^
' Senator Gore asserted his right under]
I the rules of the Senate to amend his ' '
resolution before it was voted upon. ] ^
He was permitted to perfect his resolu"
tion. And by such action he was able ! r
I to prevent the Senate from voting I ?
i down bis original resolution.
The vote of the Senate, however,
| must be considered a virtual and overa
whelm ins; victory for the President.
u
The very fact that Senator Gore aniend*
ed his resolution so as to give it a r
i meaning diametrically opposite to its
> original meaning is considered evidence tj
I of the weakness of the original resolu)
tion in the Senate.
The text of the amendment to his tl
resolution by Mr. Gore was as follows: Ci
I "The sinking by a submarine without
notice or warning ??f an armed 0
' j merchant vessel of her nublic enemy, j
resulting in the death of a citizen of
the United States, would constitute a
just and sufficient cause of., war be-J Sl

Stick to Support of President. ^
As soon as the amendment had been s
- offered, it was evident that, without
debate, the senators must cast their a
votes upon a new question, exactly op- A
posite to that for which they had assembled
to vote. ~
r Believing that the parliamentary trick
would be evident to the entire world,
and that they could best express their
willingness to support the President by i
voting as they would have done on the
original resolution, supporters of the C?
President in this crisis, including Sena- w
tor Lodge and many other republicans,
voted "aye" on the motion to table.
The scene in the Senate during the
voting was more stormy than it has j A
been for years. The galleries were J b<
crowded to their utmost and hundreds hi
of persons stood in the corridors un- q
able to obtain entrance. On tne floor
of the Senate scores of members of f^
