WAR DEFI
OF WILSON
Sustains President in T-Boat
Crisis by Vote, to 14.
Fearing Roll Call Record, So
lons Flock to Standard.
OPPOSE WARNING AMERICANS
Brand Gore's Story of Advocat
ing War as False.
His Motion Tallied: House Will
Follow Suit.
Washington. March S. By a
vote of 68 to 14, a greater ma
jority than they haH expected,
administration forces in the sen
ate today tabled Sentor Gore's
resolution to warn Americans
off the armed ships of the Euro
pean belliprerents and thereby
finally quelled in the senate an
agitation which had embarrassed
President Wilson in the subma
rine negotiations with Germany.
Senator Gore's resolution, a
"sub" by Senator McCumber, a
Republican, and an attempt by
Senator Gore to strengthen his
original proposal, all were de
feated at one time on a roll call
on a motion by Senator James,
one of the administration whips,
to table them. The administra
tion victorv in the senate trans
ferred the fight to the house.
Gore's lEesolntion.
The text of the Gore resolution fol
lows :
"Whereas. a number "f leading
powers of the world are now engaged
in a war of unexampled proportions;
and.
"Whereas, the United States is hap
pily at peace with all of the belliger
ent nations; and,
"Whereas, it is equally the desire
and the interest of the American peo
ple to remain at peace with all the
nations; and,
"Whereas, the president has recent
ly afforded fresh and signal proofs of
the superiority of diplomacy to butch
ery as a method of settling interna
tionol disputes; and.
"Whereas, the right of American
citizens to travel on unarmed belliger
ents' vessels has recently received re
newed guarantees of respect and in
violability; and.
"Whereas, the right of American
citizens travel on armed belliger
ents' vessels rather than upon unarm
ed vessels is essential neither to their
life, liberty or safety, nor to the in
dependence, dignity or security of the
United States; and.
War Vested in Congress.
"Whereas, congress alone has been
vested with the power to declare war.
which involves the obligations to pre
vent war by all proper means consist
ent with the honor and vital interests
of the nation: therefore, be it
"Resolved, by the senate, the house
of representatives concurring, that it
is the sense of the congress vested as
it is with the sole power to declare
war, that all persons owing allegiance
to the United States should in behalf
of their own safety and the vital in
terest of the United States, forbear to
exercise the right to travel as passen
gers upon any armed vessel of any
belligerent power whether such vessel
be armed for offensive or defensive

TUESDAY SNOW
MEANS MILLIONS
TO THEFARMERS
Benefit of Last Fall Is Estimat
ed at $8,500,000.
It WiU Add a Bushel to Yield
of Every Acre.
CAME JUST AT RIGHT TIME
Figures Are Based on Unofficial
Information.
Predictions at the Office of
J. C. Mohler.
Tuesday's snow will add a bushel
to every acre sown to wheat in Kan
sas, according to unofficial advices re
ceived today by J. C Mohler, secre
tary of the state board of agriculture.
Hased en the state's pmhable winter
wheat acreage and the speculative
price for next summer. Tuesday's
snow was worth IS, 500,000 to Kansas.
In his office in the state house to
day. Secretary Mohler declared the
big snow of Tuesday would greatly
benefit growing conditions in t lie big
wheat producing counties of the state.
1'nless the benefits of the wet-k are
dissipated in some future misfortune,
Kansas farmers will probably add
eight and a half million dollars to
their year's earnings as a result of tho
snow.
"I have received several statements
to the t f feet that the snow would add
one bushel to the acreage production
for the state," said Mohler. "OY
course these figures are not of f ichil.
Yet, it is quite interesting to note the
benefits from such blessings as a big
snow at Just the right time and under
the right conditions.
"There are probably 8,500,000 acres
of winter wheat in Kansas. Assum
ing that the estimates are true, the
state's wheat crop for this year has
been increased 8.500.000 bushels. if
the high prices continue, that ought
to mean a dollar a bushel for the out
put, or an $8,500,000 snow."
Able to Hold Crops.
Mohler. who returned this morning
from a trip into Dickinson county, de
clared the farmers of the state are in
excellent financial condition. They
are able to hold their crops for top
prices, he said, and their financial
standing is better than at any time
in years.
"While I was in Abilene, I saw
farmers hauling wheat to the local
markets. It wasn't wheat from the
1915 crop, but wheat grown in 10 11.
A few years ago such a thing would
have been impossible. Now the farm
ers have money .and are in a position
to hold their crops for highest pos
sible prices. It is the best possible
evidence of the state's prosperity."
While Secretary Mohler will not is
sue an official bulletin until early
spring, unofficial reports to the board
of agriculture have indicated ideal
conditions f or the growth of winter
wheat. Now Mohler suspects that the
big blanket of snow will mean eight
and a half million dollars to the Kan
sas farmers.
FIGURES THAT LIE
Estimates of Experts in
Passenger Rate Case
the
Do Not Agree in Any Im
portant Particulars.
For three hours today Elliott Hol
brook, alnation engineer of the Union
Pacific railway, disputed the figures
submitted by the publir utilities com
mission's own engineer for use in the
passenger rate case. Hoi brook de
fended strongly his own figures for
the distribution of expenses of rail
road operation and declared that he
neither knew nor could he understand
the figures which the state commis
sion assumed to have in its possession
During his final hours on the wit
ness stand, Holbrook cross fired the
rommissinn's In wvprs roncerninu
methods In the purchase of ties, the
I distribution of the expense and the
j items which composed the charges
Then the witness spent another thirty
minutes in the discussion of ballast.
He refused to admit that speculative
and theoretical methods of determin
ing exp nse were better than those
' mplofi in his analysis.
I Attorney for the commission sought
to force from Holbrook an admission
that flaws existed in his system of
accounting for expense items. The
valuation engineer was determined.
He refused to yield. When the law
yers spoke harshly to him, he re
plied in the same tone. "When a ques
tion was put in soft and soothing
tones. Holbrook maintained his com
posers and usually went the lawyers
one better in his courteous retort.
The examination of Holbrook will
be concluded late today. It is prob
able that the commission will then
announce a recess until Monday
morning. At that time Engineer
Strickler will be called to the stand
by the commission and the case of
the Union Pacific as affecting pas
senger rates will probably be con
cluded sometime Tuesday.
Attorneys for the Santa Fe an
nounced today that they would be
ready to presnt their case Wednesday.
The commission will arrange to take
up the Santa Fe case at this time. Tt
has not been announced whether the
commission will attempt to sandwich
the Missouri Pacific case between the
cases of the Union Pacific and Santa
Fe, or will direct the Missouri Pacific
to succeed the Santa Fe in the giving
of testimony.

IT'S ONLYA BLUFF
Prof. Usher So Styles Uncle
Sam's Monroe Doctrine.
England, Not U. S., Has Pre
vented European Invasion.
St. Louis. March 3. Prof. Roland
O. Usher of the department of history
of Washington university, in an ad
dress before the mayors' conference on
national defense, this afternoon dis
cussed the Monroe doctrine.
"Europeans." he said, "deny that the
Monroe doctrine ever has been a real
ity. If this be true, we cannot main
tain it or defend it because it has
never been anything but a huge piece
of bluff."
Professor Usher said this was a
common view in England. France and
Germany. He continued:
Don't Want Protection.
"South America is not now In dan
ger of European conquest," he said,
"and does not need the Monroe doc
trine. As far as an economic conquest
of South America is concerned, th
Monroe doctrine is not needed to pre
vent it because it already has taken
place. And South Americans do not
want interference by the United States
in this situation. They look upon Eu
ropeans as their best friends. To Eu
ropeans and South Americans the
Alonroe doctrine means an aggressive
scheme by the United States to extend
its own commercial influence In South
America at the expense of both Euro
peans and South Americans. It is
largely the Monroe doctrine that
causes us to be feared in South Amer
ica." VAXDKKBII.T SKES CHISIS.

mittee on national defense, in an ad
dress hore today before the National
Conference of Mayors.
The nation faces a crisis1, Mr. Van
dcrbiit said, and the decision of the
people, who, he declared, have a right
to know what our naval officers are
able to tell us, will determine "whether
this nation shall be preserved from
external domination." He said it wa.s
vital that the question of national de

New York, March 3. "For heav.

such circular," wrote Colonel Roose
velt a year ago to Henry Green, a
publicity agent, who was beginning a
country-wide canvass, with a view to
classifying presidential candidates and
reading the barometer of public opin
ion. Green sent circulars to 20,000 prom
inent men. He has received 3,000 an

presidential preferences. Roosevelt so
far has polled more than 40 per cent
of the Republican vote. Following
him in order are Burton, Hughes,
Root and Senator Borah.
Ther-i were only two Democratic

Germans Renew Terrific Smash

Capture Douaumont Village and
1,000 French Prisoners-
I5Y CHARLES P. STEWART.
London, March 3. German troops
have captured the village of Douau
mont, four miles northeast of Verdun
and just outside Fori IKmaumont aft
er a fierce struggle, taking l.OOO pris
oners and a number of guns, the Ger
man war office reiortedi this after
! noon.
Renewing their offensive ,ith
heavy blows, the Germans are driving
: toward Vtrdun from the southwest,
Berlin reported. German fliers have
; bombarded the city and German in
fantry is attempting to cut off French
forces holding Pepper Heights to the
; north.
The French war office admitted
that the Teutons have penetrated the
i French line at Douaumont after suf
i fering "cruel losses," but declared the
; struggle for possession of the village
I is continuing.
Repulsed at vaux:.
Paris also claimed the repulse of at
tacks east of the village of Vaux, out
side Fort De Vaux, southeast of Fort
Douaumont. The Germans are bom
barding French positions east and
southeast of Verdun with the greatest
Intensity. The French are pouring
steady sheets of fire across the Woevre
plains and the German infantry has
been unable to advance. German
guns suddenly became very active las
night on the front west of the Meuse,
Paris also reported. Near Malancourt
and Haucourt, nine miles northwest
of Verdun, the bombardment was par
ticularly violent.
The German war office admitted
the loss of positions to the P.ritish
around Ypres but gave no intimation
as to the extent of the British opera
tions. "Close fighting developed south of
the La Bassee canal in the region of
Ypres and the English now hold part
of a German bastion," read the Ber
lin statement.
Drops XI nth Aeroplane.
Berlin reported the repulse of a
French attack in the Bolonite woods
in the Argonno.
The official Berlin statement relates
that German airmen dropped bombs
in the vicinity of the main Verdun
fort and that to the east of Douaul,
Lieutenant Immelman shot down a
British biplane, the ninth aeroplane
accounted for by him.
According to one unconfirmed re
port, from Stockholm today, Field
Marshal Von Mackensen. hero of the
German Galicia and Balkan cam
paigns, has joined the kaiser and
crown prince and is directing the Ver
dun operations.
The Teutons are using shells lavish
ly In a furious cannonade. The
French position on Pepper Heights
and westward across the Meuse are
under terrific bombardment. Infan
try fighting has begun southeast of
Verdun, indicating a renewal of the
attempt to ring the fortress from the
south.
British Take Trenches.
At the same time, the sudden thrust
by the British on the Ypres front has
attracted the attention of military
critics. After artillery preparation,
British troops captured the SOO yards
of "international trenches" along the
Ypres-Comines canal, lost to the Teu
tons February 14, and took another
small position.
The latest official dispa-tches from
Berlin reported heavy bombardment
of the German position around Ypres
by the British. It is thought pos
sible the British attack on this sector
marks the beginning of a counter of
fensive. Berlin advices today admitted that
the sorgy Woevre plain east and
south of Verdun has proved a great
hinderance to the movement of the
heavy guns, thus explaining the lull
in the battle.
"But our troops are going forward
again, ' said a delaved Berlin dispatch.

peace and constitutional govern
ment there. Tn the territory through
which his forces have passed he haa
been accorded a reception greater
than he or his best friends expected ho
would receive. The very name of Diax
has served to rally to him the best
elements In the country. Every prom
inent Mexican who is today in exile la
with him at least in spirit."
