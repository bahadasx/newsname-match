PB4MWEU OP nr.HE WAR.
Wathing .doing along the battle fronts
•xcept .at V«rdan, «here for the last
week perhaps the greatest 'battle of the
war has beea and is still raging. Details
as ret aro indefinite. Perhaps beoaose
they are all too busy fighting to stop and
•end ia news.
gome estimates of losses have come in
but the only thing reliable about them
is that the losses have been terrific.
The Germans have been attacking the
French entrenchments in vast numbers
and solid columns. Violent -cannonad
ing has fairly levelled many of the outer
French tranches. With all tlus, so tar.
there has been no great gain of territory
-on the part of the Germans, they having
taken only one outlying fort about four
miles northeast of Verdun. Seventeen
forts and many trench fortifications de
fend the city.
Elsewhere in this issue we say more
about this pivotal city.
A short distance to the west in the
Champaign district, there has also bepn
fighting in which a German success #aa
first made and later the French ie.
covered the ground at least in pact.
This perhaps is just a sort of flanking
movement to keep reinforcements from
going to Verdun.
Military experts express varied opin
ions as ta what the German drive on
Verdun means as a military movement.
Many think it just a beginning of a
grand assault all along the line, others
that it means soon another attack on
aomo other point, while others think it
is just to tak* Verdun which in itself
would be very desireable to the Germans
as it would include within their lines a
itrongly fortified city which hitherto for
year and a half they have had sur
rounded in a half circle.
Yesterday's dispatohes say fighting at
Verdun stopped on Wednesday wheth
er arranging tor anew attack there or
elsewhere is a question.

WHEAT PRICES.
The last ten days wheat like the famous
Humpty Dumpty has made a remarkable
fall during the last ten days and perhaps
barring "corner" made a larger change
for the same time than ever before known.
Whether like Sir Humpty ".all the king's
men" will or will not b9 able to put
wheat "together again" in this case it is
somewhat a question of "king's men" all
right.
As long as the war lasts these sudden
and great changes may b? looked for and
expected. The grain exchanges are very
susceptable to any sort of war news
The slightest supposition that the U. S.
is in danger of breaking off with either
of the warring nations sends wheat and
stocks down.
Also, so far, any advantage made or
claimed by
Germany
has been constru­
ed as bear stuff. The theory is thatcar
go vessels would be endangered,
England's efforts to stop American
wheat and other products from going to
Germany has not cut much figure as the
natural situation in this regard uasbeen
against Germany, as all she has been
able to get has bad to come through her
near by neutral neighbors.
What the effect of peace in the near
future if it comes, is also a matter of
guess work, though the indications are
that the big grain dealers figure this al
ways as a bear argument.
Really, when one thinks of it, why
should the war situation make any ma
terial difference in the actual consump
tion of wheat in Europe. A soldier will
ear about the same quantify of bread
whether his country is at prace or war.
But in the long run warfare dimin
ishes the number of eaters as well as the
ability to purchase.
If the latter is true it may make the
wheat of the coming season of a com
parative low price.
But we are not betting on it, and we
don't think it pays any farmer to bet on
it. Better go ahead and raise the
usual crops and let the speculators
speculate.
VERDUN.
Verdun is a strongly fortified city near
the French frontier and not far from
the German fortified city of Metz which
lies a little to the east.
This city has formed a pivot on which
the Teutonic armies swung as they
swept on their way to Paris a year and a
half ago, and on which they have been
swung backwards again by the Frenoh
to the present lines. Nowithstanding
most desperate fighting neither party
has since the beginning of the war made
any special progress at Verdun or to the
east of that position.
It is one of the fortified positions that
France has built with many others along
the Alsace Loraine line to prevent the
ingress of Germany and is faced on their
side by equally strong positions intended
as defences against the French.
It was this fact,that in order to march
into France direct from Germany that
the German armies must first necessari
ly besiege these forts, that the route of
the German army was made through
Belgium instead, as France had not for
tilled its boundary against that country.
Up to this time Verdun has formed a
"salient" extending some miles into the
German lines. As such it has doubt
lees formed a thorn in the flesh to the
Germans and thfe, coupled with the im
portance of the fortifications in them
selves, as well as the moral effect, have
.canted the Germans to make op their
minds that they Oonld "afford to pay
the price" to win it.
At this writing, they have apparently
already paid an immense prioe, and so
far without any definite advantage.
They have now been fighting six days
with heavy forces and grant losses on
ready probably the tdodiest battle of the
ooatMtioo. war and that the losses are enormous.

RED CLOVER IN THE ALKAI4.
v'-i •r€&"
An exhibit of red clover which was
shown at the Institute held two weeks
ago in this city, by Mr. J. N. Pritchard
is worthy of more than passing mentiofi,
as having considerable significance.i
The single plant in itself was a magni
ficent specimen. With its short singll
root of about four inches it raeaeigred
thirty-six inches long, had eeventy-twd
main stems and more than two hundi«d
and fifty heads full of seed.
It was a "volunteer" growth but had
plent/ of company and grew in the bot
tom of the McArthur ditch adjoiqiinji
Mr. Pritchard'8 farm, on the yellow clajf
subsoil which at that point is five feet
below the natural surface.
This section of the soiinty has gener
ally been considered as rather poor Sou
for farming as the land is supposed to
be alkali, notwithstanding the fact that
good farming there raises good crops,
just as well as is does in other plaoee.
Another point shown by this exhibit
is the fact that the yellow clay subsoil
underlying the black loam, in a layer
averaging twelve to fifteen feet is just as
fertile as the three,,or four feet,of black
soil above it.
In fact this exhibit, which may now
be eeen in the office of the Pioneer Ex
press, proves positively, that the "alkali
flats" of Joliette and Carlisle townships
are fields of inexhaustible fertility.
Twenty-five years from now the "alkali
flats" when drained and cultivated will
become the most valuable lands in the
county, because the excess of alkali is
but an excess of fertilizer.
STATE SENATOR ELECTION
The following extract from the ses
sion laws of 1913 may be of interest as
news to the voters of this the First Leg
islative District. Ity its terms it would,
seem that we have to elect a successor,
to Hon. A. J. MeFadden at the comingf
state and county primary election this
year.
Section 1. Number of District. "Un
til otherwise provided by law under the
terms of the Constitution, the legistative
assembly of the State of North Dakota
shall until the end of 1914 consist of fifty
senators and one hundred and twelvfe
representatives, and shall thereafter
consist of forty-nine senators and one
hunured and thirteen representatives,
and the senatorial and representative
districts of the state shall be formed,
and the senators and representatives be.
apportioned as follows.
(1) The eastern part of Pembina Co?
now consituting the first legislative die
MHell
trict, shall be added to and beeome a'
part of the second legislative district
and the said second legislative distrust irasubjects
hereby renumbered and shall hereafter
be and beicome known as the First Leg
islative District, and the term of the
senator from the district so enlarged and
renumbered ahall continue for the period
for which be was elected ns senator of,
the secoud legislative district, and the
said first legislative district shall in
November, 1914, elect his successor for a
term of b.ut two years, and the said dis
trict consisting of' the county of Pern-,
bina shall be entitled to one senator and!
three representatives.
MOTIVE PLUS REASON.
The history of the world as well as the
life history of the ordinary man is full of
sad mistakes, often tragedies, often act
ually criminal, many times absurd an(£
foolish, all of which were inspired by the
best of motivee.
It isn't enough to have gasoline in
your car, you must also use the steering
wheel. Man is endowed with reason as
well motive. He is responsible as much,
for the proper use of the one as well as'
the other.
is paved with good intentions."
Editor Lee of the Walhalla Mountain*
eer started on volume 20 last week as
bright and enthusiastic as his first issue.
The Mountaineer is still enjoying the
best patronage in the way of advertise*
ments of any newspaper in the county,
which speaks well for the businessmen
of Walhalla, and Mr. Lee is keeping the'
Mountaineer up to its support. A town
as a rule can be measured by the sup
port its newspaper gets, and the oasnal
observer takes that view of it. No little
business place can afford to run a page
advertisement regularly any more than
a large business place can afford to ope
rate without the use of printing ink.
This is an era when the casual buyef
reads, and we will wager the treats that
the Walhalla businessmen reaches over
into somebody else's territory. The
Mountaineer has our good wishes.

Communication.
A veiy large number of the citizens of
Pembina are interested directly in farm
ing and quite a number of farmers spend
the winter months in town returning to
the farow at seeding time.
The bbject primarily of a farmers club
is to improve the farmer and render him
more skilful in planning his work al
though of course the social side should
not be overlooked.
Probably, no one would dispute the
assertion that if each farmer in the ter
ritory tributary to Pembina should in
some manner become skilled to the point
where he would be equal to the best
farmer in the territory our land would
within a year more than double in price.
Our merhants would cease worrying
about collections and our farmers would
wear the "smile which would not come
off.
We can each learn something from an
other and frequent meetings would sti
mulate our good resolutions and could
not but be profitable.
The is the material here for one of the
best clubs in the state and if we can
once organize we will all wonder why it
was not done long ago.

Our Basket Ball Trip
On last Friday our basket ball team
went to Grand Forks and took part in
the district high school tournanfent.
We played Michigan City on the big
University floor at 8 o'clock Friday even
ing. During the first half our team
oould not get their bearings and did not
display a knowledge of the game to the
extent that the writer knew they were
capable of,Michigan ran up a large score
during the first 90 minutes, 22 to 8.
However our boys found themselves at
the beginning of the 2nd half and out*
played Michigan during the rest of the
game, scoring 12 points to Michigan's 7
during this half.
Previous to this game Michigan de
feated Petersburg and Grand Forks de
feated Langdon. Following our game
Grand Forks defeated Park River in a
oloae bard game by one point only.
This left Miohigsn and Grand Forks to
play off the final game on Saturday even
ing whloh resulted in a victory for Michi
gan with a 16 to 23 seore. This entitles
Michigan to oompete in the state oontest

But what of defeat? Of course we
would liked to have to won. But there
are many lessons to learn in defeat. Of
ten defeat is better than victory. The
Pembina team did its best. They play
ed a splendid game in the last half.
They proved themselves sportsmen by
congratulating their opponents not only
upon their success but upon their abili
ty-
The trip was mnch enjoyed by all.
We came into contact with other schools.
We met them in fair aud friendly battle.
We saw our great State University. We
formed opinions. We yearned for high
er yearning. Some day some of us will
be there. We may meet our opponents
again. Next time perhaps as team
mates on the University team.
