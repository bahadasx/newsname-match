FAILED TO REACH
AN AGREEM
President And Leaders 0! Congress
ill Far
Chief Executive
Compromise
Washington, March 2. The presi
dent and tho leaders of congress have
failed thus far to ngrco In regard to
A vote ou tho submarine Issue. The
ending of many conferences found tne
prosldcnt determined to force tho la
ouo presented by his letter to the
rules committee of the house arid
standing firm against any compromise.
A decisive vote on the resolution
warning Americans off armed passen
ger ships was insisted upon by the
president. Tho consternation of con
gress Is greater than It was tho night
when the president unexpectedly sent
his lettor to Acting Chairman Pou.
Many attempts were made by the
leaders to get together and decide
upon some definite program, but all
theso efforts failed and the house
leaders decided to send Chairman
Blood to tuo White House to see- if o
moro definite understanding with the
president could bo reached..
At a .meeting of the house commit
tee of foreign affairs an attempt was
made to yield to tho president's sug
gestion and report out tho McLemoro
resolution warning Americans off
armed ships. This attempt was howl
ed down in tho committee and tho in
cident disclosed the fact that only
(our of the sixteen members who
woro present seemed disposed to )
stand by the president's wishes.)
At the same time on the floor of
the house and in the lobbies confi
dent assertions, the kind that wero
heard a week or more ago, were be
ing made by Democratic leaders that
K the armed merchantmen resolutions
wero Immediately put to a vote, as
the president had requested, It would
bo passed by tho house.
Administration leaders are not so
cock sure as they were Tuesday night,
but thoy still Insist tho president
would easily carry the day In
tue
house and senate. One careful esti
mate prepared by administration lead
ers in concress showed that there
vfiittd tin f mnrpln ef nt lonaf alvforui I
votes nt;alnst the resolution in the
hoi'iso. Tho president's advisers real
ize, however, that this figure Is alto
gether too cfoso, and tho congression
al leaders contend a victory for the
president by such a narrow margin
would be moro disastrous to this gov
ernment's foreign policy than a con
tinuance of tho present uncertain sit
uation, i Yhe Compromise.
Congressional leaders want to com
promise with the president by Intro
ducing and passing a 'resolution ex
pressing confidence in his conduct or
tho submarine issue, but Mr. Wilson
thus far has refused to accept such
a course and has demanded a decisive
vote on tho resolutions warning Amer
icans from armed merchantmen. Ho
takes tho stand that congress has
caused all the trouble by tho inlrb
ductlon and the discussion of these
resolutions, and it is now up to con

gress to undo the work by action lu
regard to them which enn not be mis
construed. The Republican vote In congress
also is a factor that Is causing tho
pdministration some concern. It is
realized that the Republicans will not
consent to support a compromise reso
lution of tho general character pro
posed by tho Democrats expressing
confidence in the president. For tho
present, indications are that many if
not most of tho Tammany Democrats
in congress will be lined up against
tho-president if tho issue is forced to
a vote.
Acting Chnirman Pou of rules com
mittee ntade an announcement that
indicates that tho administration may
resort to heroic methods to force ac
tion in tho house. "Unless the foreign-affairs
committee roports a reso
lution In conformity with tho course
Fuggcsted by the president the rules
committee will take the matter Into
its own hands," said Mr. Pou. The
statement by Pou had tho effect of
further arousing tho revoltors.

years a strike occurred in tho Stetson

DRAFT A BiU TOR CONGRESS
Under Plan Prooosed All Officers
Above Rank of Lieutenant Would
Be Subject to Promotion by Seleo
tlons to Be Made From Each Grade
by Officers of Ranks Above Other
Features of the Bill.
"Washington, March 2. In a bill
drafted by the navy personnel board
and transmitted to congress by Secre
tary Daniels, it Is proposed to pro
mote officers by selection Instead of
by seniority. An Increase of 50 per
cent in officers of all grades, creation
of a war reserve list and restoration
of the popular old rank of commodore
also are suggested.
Tho measure, tho result of two
years' study and work by the board,
Is designed to increase tho efficiency
of the service, put able men in cotn
canding positions at an earlier age
and open the way for the rise of sub
ordinate officers, now virtually barred
fiom hope of promotion.
Under the plan, all officers above
the rank of lieutenant would be sub
ject to promotion by selection upon
passage of the bill, the selections be
ing made from each grade by officers
of the ranks above.
The board reported that after care
ful consideration it was convinced the
system of promotion by seniority
most be abandoned.
Attached to the report is an appen
dix dealing with the need of the ma
rine corps brought about by increases
in' the navy personnel. This proposes
that the total number of enlisted men
o' the marine corps shall be increased
to 20 per cent of the total authorized
strength of the navy, and that the to
tal number of marine corps officers,
shall be 4 per cent of the authorized
number of enlisted men. The war re
serve contemplated in the bill would j
be established by transferring to the
list officers who attain the prescribed
age in grade without being selected
for promotion.
Seaplane Raids English Coast.
London, March 2. A German sea

quarters that the visit was the fore'
runner of other raids.

ceives Ultimatum.
London. March 2. Tho legions of
the kaiser operating in the Verdun
region continue their bombardments
west of the Meuse in the sector be
tween Malancourt and Forges, across
the river eastward about Vaus and
Dam Lou pa and against French
forces in the Woevre region, south
east of Verdun.
Their big offensive, however, so -far
ns infantry attacks are concerned, has
ceased, at least for the ' moment
Whether it will begin again or wheth
er the Germans will rest content with
tho point of vantage they have gained
is not indicated in the official reports
of cither Berlin or Paris.
Unofficial advices from Berlin have
stated that the German plan o! cam
paign has been primarily based on
the bombardment of sectors they de
sire to attain and it is possible that.
they may now be drawing up their
big guns to captured positions witti
the object of shelling points nearer
their objective Verdun.
To the east of Verdun around Pont-n-Mousson
the French have bombard
ed German positions in LePetre wood
and near Thiacourt. Artillery duels,
have been In progress in Alsace.
There has been no resumption of Ger
man attacks against the French In
the Champagne region.
While nothing of especial import
ance has taken place along the British
part of the line, the effect of the Ger
man offensive in the Verdun region
is shown in the lengthening of their
front In order to release the French
reinforcements of the army opposing
the German advance. Advices had
placed the extreme southern end of
the British line 'in' the region of Lens.
The latest British official communica
tion reports the British fighting tee
the north of the Somme. which would
show that they have stretched their
front between thirty and forty miles
flown to the region of Amiens.
Little is going on in Russia except
Isolated bombardments and infantry
attacks and air raids. On the Italian,
front the Italians have occup.led and
consolidated an Austrian position on.

Germany, according to Madrid, has
