dence
The violent German offensive on i
Verdun lias been resumed, tlie fight
ing faking on an extremely desperate
character north of the French strong- i
hold.
The Paris War Office claims that the ;
French repulsed all the German at
facks, except that west of Fort j
Douaumont, the Germans succeeded'
in reaching the village of Douaumont]
Where the struggle Is being contin- ;
ued.
The half In the determined German I
offensive directed at the stronghold J
lias been attributed by many observers
to the difficulties of Terrain interfering]
with the movement of heavy artillery,
by the concentrated fire of which thel
i 'rown Prince's army blasted their way
f lirough the outer defenses. Appar-1
ently the Germans now have been able |
to bring up some at least of their:
larger pieces, for the French War Of- I
flee has reported a considerable in- !
crease in the Intensity of the fire along
the whole front at Verdun, both to the
north and northwest and In the
Woevre region to the east and south-]
past.
Hammer llic Dead Man
The orives from these two sides
now renewed, are held to indicate the
familiar German plan of rolling up
the flanks of a position or using the
clawhammer jaws of the military ma
chine to get at (he kernel of the nut.
Significance may be attached in this
connection to the development of a
heavy bombardment of the French
positions on La .Mort Homme (the
Dead Man). This hill lies a mile and
a half west of the bend in the Meuse
to the northwest of Verdun, from
which it is eight miles distant. No
Infantry attack on this flank posi
tion has yet been reported, however,
the renewal of the assaults taking
place in the Douaumont region, on
the northwest front where the French
last night reported a German repulse.
Expect Argonne Drive
Possible development of some Ger
man movement in the Argonne, still
further to the northwest of the fort
ress, is indicated by the Paris report
that the French have directed a con
centrated lire 011 hostile positions
there. Observers' eyes also are still
on the Champagne region, beyond the
Argonne, where the Germans recent
ly made gains toward the south and
where a serious break in the French
lines would have a material influence
on the situation at Verdun by inter
fering with lines of communication
from the west.
German military writers are laying
stress on the large amount of terri
tory wrested from the French
in the first /week of' the
advance on Verdun, pointing to the
advantage which the reduction of the
defensive front of the fortress gives

i moving eastward and Captain Munke
j witz altered the course of his shit) 1
