-"HALF A NEGRO"
TO CHICAGO
Republicans Turn Down George Gen
try at State Convention, Tho' Da
vison Makes a Hard Fight.
The republicans of Kentucky in
convention at Louisville, sat down
"hard upon poor old George W. Gen
try, the local negro, who has been
fighting the battles of that party for
over 40 years. Although the con
vention sent eight delegates-at-large
to the national convention, they only
gave one place to a negro, and Phil
Brown, a negro editor of Hopkins
ville got that, giving Kentucky as
a number of negro delegates termed
it, "half a negro" at the national
convention. The "Big Eight" chosen
were Ed Morrow, Marshall Bullitt,
Judge E. C. O'Rear, A. E. Willson,
Richard P. Ernst, and Congressman
Caleb Powers, and Phil Brown, the
negro.
The feature of the convention
from a local standpoint, was the hard
fight made for a full negro represen
tation, or two delegates, by Dr. Rob
ert L. Davison, chairman of the Lin
coln County Republican Committee.
By a vote of 1,987 1-2 to 322 1-2,
the convention, however, voted down
all efforts to put Gentry on the del
egation. The convention witnessed
some warm times. The Courier
Journal said the following of the
matter.
Immediately following the reading
of the report of the Resolutions Com
mittee, recommending that seven
white men and only one negro be
sent as delegates at large to the na
tional convention, pandemonium
broke loose among the negro dele
gates, who insisted above the hub
bub that six white men and two ne
groes be named. The fight to that
end was started by J. E. Wood, a
negro delegate from Danville, who
moved that George W. Gentry, col
ored, of Stanford, recommended by
the Resolutions Committee, in its re
port, for indorsement for the post of
assistant doorkeeper at the national
convention, be substituted for one of
the seven white men recommended
for committeeman from the state at
large. The motion was quickly sec
onded by other negro delegates, and
soon the word went out that if the
negroes were not allowed ,to have
their way they would walk out of the
convention, costing the Republicans
85,000 votes in the coming Novem
ber election.
Realizing the gravity of the situ
ation, Edwin P. Morrow, at this
point, in a dramatic speech, offered
himself as a sacrifice. Throwing off
the restraining arms of Maurice Gal
vin, of Covington; Caleb Powers and
others, Mr. Morrow sprang to the
platform and asked the convention
to name the negro Gentry in his
place. A storm of applause, domi
nated by a roar of "noes," greeted
Mr. Morrow's suggestion. The dele
gates would not let the suggestion
come to a vote.
Dr. Robert L. Davison, of Stan
ford, advocating adoption of Wood's
motion, said that were 85,000 loyal
republican negroes in Kentucky and
that unless they were given fair rep
resentation in the selection of dele
gates from the state at large they
would be heard from in the coming
election.
Such turmoil prevailed at this
point in the proceedings that it be
came necessary for the chairman to
name three persons as sergeants-at-arms
to restore order.
Thurman Dixon, who was tempora
ry chairman had barely finished his
keynote speech when Dr. Robert L.
Davison, of Lincoln county, inaugu
rated a ruckus over the number of
negro delegates to be sent from the
State at large to the national conven
tion. "I rise to a question of personal
privilege and information, Mr. Chair
man," he said, as he made his way
to the front of the rostrum and ad
dressed the delegates, rather than the
chairman. "I want to know what
has been done for the colored repub
licans of Kentucky. I ask whether
this convention is going to send two
jiegro delegates to Chicago out of
the eight, or only one. Heretofore
one negro has always been sent out
of four, and now if we are going to
send eight then in justice to the col
ored man we should send two ne
groes with half a vote each, so the
colored man will have one full vote
as he always has had."
Dr. Davison's remarks threw the
convention into a mild sort of up
roar. He had not finished his first
sentence when hisses and cries of
"sit down" and "throw him out"
-were heard. A score or more of del
egates from all parts of the hall
loudly shouted points of order which
nobody could understand. A11 the
while a negro delegate, immediately
in front of the rostrum, looked
straight into Chairman Dixon's face
and spoke vehemently in favor of
two negro delegates.
Chairman Dixon tried to explain
to Davison, that he was out of order,
but the latter stamped his foot,
shook his fist and sat down on the
chairman's desk smiling. By this
time half a dozen .men on or near
the platform were speaking. Secre
tary Alvis S. Bennett walked over to
Davison and threw his arms around
his shoulders, and the display of af
fection brought another smile from
Davison, but no indication of a wil
lingness to move.
And then Mr. Davison, who never
wearied of well doing, but kept, a
seat within six feet of Chairman
Moss and waited for openings, went
to the front of the rostrum for the
sixth time and, with a sweeping wave
of his right arm, attempted to in
fluence the audience. He did. The
delegates howled and the band play
ed till he sat again on the chairman's
table. But the convention voted him
and Gentry down.
May Hold Negro Convention.
That the action of the republican
convention in turning down Gentry
and the negro delegates is bitterly
resented by them, is shown by a story
in the republican Lexington Leader
published Thursday which says:
A second State Republican conven
tion, is to be called at the instigation
of colored Republican leaders, may be
a result of the dissatisfaction engen
dered among some of the colored
delegates by the Louisville resolu
tions. The colored Republican organiza
tion known as the Republican Pacific
and Political League, will, it is un
derstood, assume the direction of
calling a second convention. George
W. Gentry of Lincoln county, is pres
ident of the league; Dr. E. Under
wood, of Frankfort, is Vice Presi
dent, and J. E. Wood, of Danville,
secretary; Ed Chenault and Ed Wil
lis, of Lexington, are actively inter
ested. Chenault said that the colored del
egates had no voice in the conven
tion in many instances; that the
chairman voted them in some cases
and that others were counted after
they had left the hall. "The honest
white republicans will concede that
were entitled to one-fourth rep
resentation on the delegation. We
were not consulted at all as to the
one half vote proposition. The only
Negro admitted to the party councils
was Phil Brown, and we feel that he
betrayed us.
"If it had not been for the colored
Republicans, who sat still in the boat
and voted under the Log Cabin to a
man, there would be no Republican
party in Kentucky today. The col
ored voter has been the solid basis
of Republican success in this state,
and now all he asks is that the party
will not permit a handful of office
holders to take away what little he
has been given of party honors and
recognition."
You Can't Find Any
Dandruff, and Hair
Stops Coming Out
Sae Your Hair! Make It Thick, Wa
vy, Glossy and Beautiful
At Once.
Try as you will, after an applica
tion of Danderinc, you can not find
a single trace of dandruff or falling
hair and your scalp will not itch, but
what will please you most will be af
ter a few week's use, when you see
new hair, fine and downy at first
yes but really new hair growing
all over the scalp.
A little Danderinc immediately
doubles the beauty of your hair. No
difference how dull, faded, brittle
and scraggy, just moisten a cloth
with Danderine and carefully draw it
through your hair, taking one small
strand at a time. The effect is im
mediate and amazing your hair will
be light, fluffy and wavy, and have
an appearance of abundance; an in
comparable lustre, softness and lux
uriance, the beauty and shimmer of
true hair health.
Get a 25-cent bottle of Knowlton's
Danderine from any drug store or
toilet counter, and prove that your
hair is as pretty and soft as any
that it has been neglected or injured
by careless treatment. A 25-cent
bottle will double the beauty of your
hair. 18-1
STANFORD FAIR AUG. 23, 24, 25.
The Harrodsburg Democrat, in
mentioning the dates of the fairs of
this section, says that the Stanford
fair will be held the third week in
August. This is a mistake. It is the
fourth week, and the dates claimed
are Aug. 23, 24 and 25.

YOUTHFUL, AMATEUR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS PLAY
HAVOC WITH THE LIGHTING CIRCUIT IN STANFORD
Several nights last week when
current was turned on at the
power house, reports came in
from some parts of town of an
unusual "jumping or jerking"
of the lights, and try as hard
as Supt. Frank Rout would, the
trouble could not be located at
the plant, where it was sup
posed, the trouble was to be
found. A careful investigation
was then made over the lines
and it was discovered that. Leon
ard Ball, 11-year-old son of Mr.
and Mrs.- T. C. Ball, of Depot
street, had rigged up a private
electric plant of his own, for
the purpose of doing some ex
perimental work. The embry-
FLORENCE HONORED AGAIN
As Member of Republican State Cen
tral Committe from 8th District
Eighth District republicans held an
enthusiastic and interesting conven
tion here Tuesday afternoon, and
elected two delegates and two alter
nates to the national conventon at
Chicago, sending them without in
structions in legard to presidential
matters. George D. Florence, of
Stanford, was re-elected as the
Eighth's, member of the Sttae Cen
tral Committee, without opposition.
In a spirited four-cornered race, E.
P. Black, of Madison county and L.
F. Petty, were chosen delegates to
Chicago, with J. O. Russell, of Adair
county and W. C. CundifF, of Casey
county as alternates. King Swope,
of Boyle, was named for elector, with
W. B. Saffell, colored, of Shelby
county, as assistant. A motion rec
ommending George W. Gentry, col
ored of this city, for a member of
the delegation-at-large from Kentuc
ky, was adopted before adjournment
after considerable discussion.
Every county of the 11 in the dis
trict was represented when Chairman
Florence, of the district committee,
called the convention to order, in the
courthouse at half past two o'clock.
Circuit court had adjudged in defer
ence to the occasion, and the court
room was well filled with delegates
and others. Judge Louis L. Walker,
of Lancaster, who was the republi
can nominee for lieutenant governor
last November, was. placed in nomi
nation for temporary chairman of
the convention by Henly V. Bastin,
of Garrard, and elected by acclama
tion. Judge Walker made a very ap
propriate and pointed talk to the con
vention upon assuming the chair,
which was received with applause.
Hon. J. W. Wall, who represents the
counties of Casey and Russell in the
legislature, was made secretary, and
upon motion of L. F. Petty, of Shel
byville, the appointment of the usual
committees was dispensed with, and
the temporary organization made
permanent.
The first business then taken up
was the election of a State Central
Committeeman, Chairman R. L. Da
vison, of the Lincoln county repub
lican committee, placed the name of
Hon. George D. Florence before the
convention, and numerous seconds
were had to the nomination of this
prominent, popular and active young
party leader. There were no other
nominations and he was elected by
acclamation.
Call for nomination of candidates
for delegates was then made by
Judge Walker. The name of E. P.
Black, of Madison was placed before
the convention by C. C. Wallace, of
Richmond; that, of J. L. Butler, of
Boyle, was placed in nomination by(
Henly V. Bastin, of Garrard. W. B.
Saffell, a colored leader, nominated
Ludlow F. Petty, of Shelby, and C.
A. Kenney, of Jessamine, was also
placed before the convention. The
vote stood: Petty 183; Black 103;
Butler 67; Kenney 13. The vote for
alternate was: W. C. Cundiff, of Ca
sey 157; J. O. Russell, of Adair 123;
Rev. J. E. Wood, colored, of Boyle,
70. King Swope, of Boyle, and W.
B. Saffell, colored, of Shelby, were
chosen elector and assistant for the
district, by acclamation.
Upon motion of Dr. R. L. Davi
son, the convention voted to recom
mend to the state convention, the se
lection of George W, Gentry, of this
city, for a delegate-at-large from
Kentucky to the national convention.
Dr. Davison paid to Gentry a high
tribute as a leader of his race, who
had been fighting the battles of re
publicanism for 40 years, and in ev
ery way fully worthy of the honor
he asks at the hands of his party in
the state. Rev. J. E. Wood, the col
ored leader of Danville, also made a
strong speech advocating Gentry.
The convention then adjourned.

WEATHER MARS LOT SALE
Big Crowd Was Present and Satisfac
tory Prices Were Realized
But for inclement weather, the big
lot sale conducted here Wednesday
afternoon by Waltton Bros., of Glas
gow, would have been an unqualified
success in every way. As it was, all
of the property sold for satisfactory
prices and the promotoers of the sale
did not lose anything on their ven
ture. Mrs. W. K. Warner had the
honor of naming the new addition
to Stanford Embry Heights, that
title being selected by the judges as
the most appropriate one and Mrs.
Warner thereby won the $5 offered
to the lady submitting the name
which should be chosen.
A tremendous crowd was present
when the sale began, but rain which
came up during the afternoon thin
ned the crowd down considerably and
the lots in consequence sold much
below what they might have brought
under better weather conditions.
Some splendid building sites were
opened up by this sale, affording op
portunity for an expansion of the
city in one of the few localities which
are suitable for home building

Our graded school is progressing
nicely. Our teachers are putting
forth every" effort for the uplifting
and upbuilding of the bright minds
entrusted to their care. And right
here we will say we have never
known brighter talent than the
young people here possess. Among
the recent .improvements for the
graded school are chairs for the
chapel room; shades for all the class
room windows; and quite a number
of new books for the library. Much
of the fund for these improvements
was raised by the teachers and -pupils
by means of entertainments.
Quite an interesting program was
rendered by the pupils last Friday at
the chapel hour in honor of Long
fellow's birthday. If we had space,
we would like to mention each pu
pil by name, -as all acquitted them
selves with distinction. On each
Thursday morning hereafter will be
held interesting exercises and the
teachers would be much encouraged
if parents, and those interested in
education would attend. The pros
perity and progress of every town
depends largely upon its school.

DANGERS OF DRAFT.
Drafts feel best when we are hot
and perspiring, just when they arc
most dangerous and the result is
Neuralgia, Stiff Neck, Sore Muscles
or sometimes an attack of Rheuma
tism. In such cases apply Sloan's
Liniment- It stimulates circulation
to the sore and painful part. The
blood flows freely and in a short
time the stiffness and pain leaves.
Those suffering from Neuralgia or
Neuralgic Headache will find one or
two applications of Sloan's Liniment
will give grateful relief. The agon
izing pain gives way to a tingling
sensation of comfort and warmth and
quiet rest and sleep is possible. Good
for Neuritis too. Price 25c at your
Druggist.
