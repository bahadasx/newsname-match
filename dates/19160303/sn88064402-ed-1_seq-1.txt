The railroads of Louisiana, as well as
those of the entire country, are having
a hard enough time now, without
Louisiana people adding to their bur
dens by "nagging" over whatare tri.
flties to the patrons, but necessary pre
cautions to the railroad itself. Rail.
road commissions are constantly edg
ing in on their sources of revenue,
while their patrons are demanding bet.
ter service, and their employes better
wages. This resulted, in 1915, in the
building of less than a thousand miles
of new track in the entire United
States-the smallest addition to the
mileage since 1864.
Men are not going to put their
money into enterprises which are sub.
ject to continual attack by public
bodies, and the railroads have been the
victims of unceasing and sometimes
senseless warfare for so long that
those who have money prefer other in
vestments. We need more railroads
and better service in Louisiana, and to
make railroad officials drop their work
and rush of to hold a two or three
days meeting whenever some indiffer
ent or unpunctual man is fined ten
cents for not having a ticket presents
itself to us as a poor way to get more
railroads and better service.

TEMPERANCE RALLY DAY
FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS
In Jefferson Davis Parish is Set For
Friday, March 10th.
Sometime ago the school board of this
parish together with Supt. Arnette at a
regular business meeting, passed re
solutions without one dissenting voice
whereby a day was set apart for the
observance of temperance in all public
schools to he known as Temperance
Rally Day. In as much as this action
was taken at the suggestion of the Par.
ish W. C. T . U. to that body of women
was given the pleasure of designating
the date and they have selected the sec*
ond Friday in March which this year
is the 10th.
Jetferson Davis has the distruction
of being the fIrst parish in the state to
have a day authorized by its school
board for special Scientific Temperance
Instruction in her public schools and it
is hoped that parents, teachers and pu.
pils will unite and make the obserance
of this day so entertaining and success
ful that other parishes will soon follow
the good example. It is expected that
each school will give a specially pre.
pared program on that day and where
possible in the evening that every one
may have an opporunity to enjoy it.
CHARBON VACCINATION
To the Liver Stock Owners of the
State:
Due to the prevalence of charbon last
year, in various sections of the state,
this board earnestly advises early in
oculation or vaccination this season on
the part of the live stock owners in
order to anticipate a re-currence of the
infection and for the purpose of having
their stock protected in ample time be
fore the advent of warm weather,
which is the charbon season.
In accord with Federal regulations,
supervising the manuftcture and dis
tribution of biological products, this
particular vaccine should bear a date
of expiration not to exceed three
months which will insure a better and
more potent material, consequently
more satisfactory results, this season.
Past experience has taught that best
results are obtained when animnals aie
vacti:ated against charbon early in the
sprilng so as to allow thirty days in
which to secure protection before the
season approaches, when chiarbon in
fection usually develops.
The state live stock sanitary board
stirongly u rges, therefore, that,' in
tlhoe sections of the state iii whchi
cnarn ii mttctiou;i has been known to
tX. t ii l)rIviou; years, vacciatioun of
ui a h iuld be cmrnnenced not later

Social Dance a Financial Success.
The social and dance given by the
Catholic ladies at their hall Wednesday
night was a decided successs financially
and from point of entertainment. The
mlusic, dancing and refreshments were
enjoyed by a large crowd. The affair
netted the ladies about $50, with gross
receipts of $75.
Ladle's Aid Society.
The Ladies' Aid met last Friday Feb.
25th at the home of Mrs. Nellie Scog.
glns. The meeting was called to order
by the President who read a chapter
from James which was followed by
prayer and singing. "What a Friend
we have in Jesus." Twenty members
responded to the word Hope. Three
visitors were present. Membership
committee reported one new member.
The response word for next meeting is
"Truth."
Some times was then taken in tran
sacting business pertaining to
the society, after which they adjourned
to meet with Mrs. Reeve March 10th.
