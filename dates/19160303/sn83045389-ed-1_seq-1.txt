for judges' pensions, pursuant:
to the aet of 191 < ?2.500 to pay money I
dlie to assessors of land: $ 10,195.2-1 for

bv Delegate Kllssell. increasing the al
lowance for one and two-room schools

a division of this item on the hasis of

\.\l) TWO-IIOOM SCHOOLS
The change does not involve an addi
tional appropriation, since the iiioip > is
taken front the school fund. The in
crease in tip allotment for one and
two-room schools means that a smaller
amount will he available for all other
primary .school purposes. The amend
ment was opposed b\ Delegates IJrewer,
Hirrell and llobson, and was supported
by Delegates MeetZO and Cordon.
After a spirited debate, the House
adopted by a vote of ."?< to -1 an amend
ment offered hy Delegate crowning, of
Orange. increasing from $.*>.000 to
$s.ooo the appropriation for the. relief
of needy t'onfederate women who arc |
not upon the State pension rolls
An appropriation of $3,000 to the Vir- j
ginia State l-'air Association, to he ap- j
plied towards the payment of premiums I
on agricultural and stock exhibits at I
the annual State Fairs, drew the lire j
of Delegate* Taylor, who moved that
the Item he stricken from the lull. He
was supported bv Delegate Sproul. who I
thought that the State wa? not justi
fied at this time in making any con- |
trihution to an enterprise from which |
ttie city of Hiclimond derives such latere
benefits and which the fair association
should arrange- to finance itself. i

Delegate ilobson made a sharp reply. !
The farmers of the State, and not the I
i it> of Itirhtiiond. lie said. arc the chief j
beneficiaries of tlie annual exhibition.!
This was particularly true, he said, of
I
the premiums, which iro almost exclu
sively to rural exhibitors.
"The city of Richmond." said Mr. :
Ilobson. "has spent $I.">t).t?00 to make j
the fair a success. Xow that the as
sociation eotnes here to ask a
small contribution to help linatice the ;
premiums, the rural members raise the ;
cry that tin: State cannot afford it ?
the same ( ry that is raised anailist any
thing that does not directly benefit the
farmers. A few minutes ago the saints I
members voted to increase the appro- '
priatlon for one and two-room schools, j
That was for the benefit of the country. ?
'!o ahead and strike out this small ap- !
propria! ion. and then come back and ;
ask us city members to help you again
ti> get something for the farmers."
The tight against the amendment was

The most interesting part of the
report is the closing paragraph, which
recommends that the West law. passed
in 1914, and made to take effect Jan
uary I. 1316. be given a fair trial, and
also recommending the limiting o?
compensation in those localities where
excesses were found to exist.
The West law does not apply until
the expiration of the present terms of
officers in cities of over 100.000 popu
lation. This, of course, applies only to
officers in the city of Richmond.

Action in the Senate, it is believed,
will bo followed promptly by stilling
of sentiment iti the House against !ho
President's foreign policy.
In one of the create: I nonpartisan
debates the Senate has seen in years.
Chairman Stone, of the Foreign Rela

in accord with the President; Senator
l.odue, the ranking Republican, pledged
his support to the President's determi
nation ?o secure to Americans their
rights on the high seas, and Senator

While the. Senate debated. there
(Mine news in the State department
from Merlin which convinced officials
that the dissension in Congress was
being used deliberately to weaken th?
President's hand in Germany. Con
iidcnlial advices stated that reports
circulated in the German capital aa
having come from Washington dec-lured
that I'ongress .stood Ave to one against
the I'resident.
Out of the Senate debute came a turn
which, for the moment, threatened to
overshadow the rosil features of tU>i
contest, and prohabty disclosed the
basis for the a?ttaiion at tlie Capitol.
Senator Gore, while the Senate sac
rapt in amazement, related a story that
President Wilson, at his conference
with Congress leaders it week ago. had
declared that Germany's insistence on
her position in the submarine contro
versy probably would result in it
brcach of diplomatic relations: that a
breach probably would be followed by
war. and that "a state of war might
not lie uf itself and of necessity an
e\il to this republic, hut that tho
I'nited States, by entering upon war
now. might be able to bring it *.o a
conclusion li> inidsuminer. and ill us
render a great service to civilization."
Mr Gore declared that he did not
say the story was true, but that it
came to him with such concurrenco
of testimony ami such marks of truth
that he dbl not feel lliat he could dis
charge his duty'as Senator and with
hold it.
Chairman Stone, >>f the Foreign Me
la tions Committee, at once replied that
the President had never stated to linn
nor in his hearing that he believed or
in any way entertained the thought
tii.it war between the i'nited States and
Germany would he desirable or would
result in good to the United States.
