MONKEYING WITH THE MUSE.
My dear Mr. Editor:
iwmit we to thank you on behalf
of the poet of the Big Bandy who may
avail themselve of the opportunity to
sail In and win that New Jersey prise
poetry money as et forth in my letter
which you clipped from The Courier
Journal, and let me at the same time
enter my solemn protest agalnBt the
mnnner of your printing the quatrain
which I Introduced near the close of
snld letter. What I did say, as I re
csll It, waa:
Ho. poets of Kentucky,
Your Pegaauses prod
Along the passes of Parnassus
And swtpe that Jersey wad.
ii.ik, t had an extra word In the
second line of th original, for Pegaau
is a darned unruly steed In the plural,
but whether I did or not, here I the
way the prlie best eight-page weekly
In Kentucky printed It:
Ho, poets of Kentucky
Tour Pegaausea now prod
Along the paaaea
And swipe that Jersey wad.
If you meant for your local poet to
thi Puuhim alons the passes
of Big Bandy and took It for granted
that they would know it wltnout your
saying it, all right. Otherwise I shall
ith Attnrnev "Tin" Moore
about a suit for damage after I have
asked Dr. Wroten to mane an exanu-
n.iinn and rennrt on the extent or tne
damage. TheMuae can not be mom-
mlcked up In that style ana noinmH
done In her behalf. The liberty of the
press must be maintained, but It must
not take too many liberties. There's
a limit. " ,
I might ay more, but my counsel
advise me to preeerve a discreet ll

MARRIAGE OF MISS
ADAMS AND MR. MYER
THE EVENT WAS 80LEMNIZED
WEDNESDAY AT HOME OF
; E. E. 8HANNON. .' '
On Wednesday morning March 1st
at the residence of the bride' aunt
Mr. E. E. Shannon, this city,- Miss
Jeanne Adam, only daughter of Mr.
and Mr. Jame Adams, wa married
to Mr. William Louis McDyer, of
Frankfort. The officiating clergy
man wa the Rev. Mr. Powell, Rector
orAll Saint Episcopal Church, Ports
mouth, Ohio, where the bride formerly
resided. The beautiful ritual of the
Episcopal church was used on thl oc
casion and was rendered In a very
Impressive manner. Just before the
coming of the bridal party Into the
parlor Mis Josephine Harklna, of
Preatonsburg, sang In a Very beauti
ful way, "I Love You", 'the accom
paniment of the very appropriate
song being played by Miss Georgia
Brown, of Jenkins. The approach of
the bride and groom waa marked by
the playing of the wedding march by
Mia Grace Wellman, of Catlettsburg.
The ring service was used. The bride,
always handsome, on this occasion
looked more than usually beauti
ful In her traveling suit of blue.
Immediately after the ceremony Mr.
and Mrs. McDyer took the C. and
O. for Cincinnati, from that place
they will go to Louisville for a short
stay and the bride will return to Louisa
for a few days visit when she will re
join Mr. McDyer in Frankfort which
wll be their future residence.
The NEWS has used sof many su
perlative adjectives in describing the
two functions which led up to this
delightful affairs that it stock la about
exhausted. All that was said, how
ever, was true, but their use leaves
rather a poor supply for a proper de
scription of the fair young woman who
la leaving a home where she waa all but
Idolized by her parents to make happy
the home of her young husband, and
that ah will do this there can b no
doubt She Is a young woman of
many and varied accomplishments,
not the leaat of which Is her ability
to adapt herself to any and. all clr
curhstance and to make a home In
all ;that the word Implies. As Jeanne
Adams she was popular and attrac
tlve and it Is safe to say that these
two desirable quail ties will not be
lessened aa Mrs. William Louis
McDyer. , .
' Of Mr. DcDyer there Is much to be
aid and all of it 1 that which la good
He comes of one ot the best families
of the State being a aon of the late
John McDyer, la a young. man of more
than ordinary Intelligence, of excellent
habits, and character above reproach
He stands well up in his profession as
civil engineer and holds a good pos
Ition In the department of highways
of the State of Kentucky. During the
happy period of his courtship he waa,
of course, a frequent visitor to Louisa
and during that period made many
friends. The NEWS figuratively
end a shower of rice and old shoes
after this happy young couple with
Its beat wishes for a long life of pros
perity and happiness.

was saved. Only the Women and small
girls of the family were at home when

ready to fall In.
A fire had. been built In a room on

country residence and the loss falls
heavily upon Mr. See, who has a large
family. He Is one of our best citizens.

GIRLS FOUR YEAR8
GARDEN COURSES
To meet the demands of thousands
successful In raising a tenth-acre of
tomatoes and who .want to "go on,"
the representatives of the Department
of Agriculture and the State collegge
In charge of the cannlngclub In the
fifteen Southern State have worked
out what might be called a progres
sive, four-year 'practical garden and
canning course for year to year add
new annual crops, encourage them to
run winter and glass-frame gardens,
and finally In the course of their
work to lead them to plant perennial!
small and orchard fruits. It 1 hoped
that under this system the girls will
gain knowledge of how to handle a
wide variety of garden vegetaables and
tree and get ready to go to high
achool or college will have a garden
of perennial fruits that readly can
be cared for by other members of her
family.
The first year of. girl'sclub work
thruout the Southern State consist
in raising tomatoes In tenth-acre gar
dens. It 1 believed by those In charge
that every girl should first master thla
plan and learn how to utilize or sell Its
products before she take up other
vegetable and fruit. In aesctlons
where tomatoes suffer from blight and
wilt however, It Is sometime necessary
to, substitute another garden crop.
