WILL WE HAVE CITY BAND?
City Fathers Have Been Request
ed To Take Some Action On
City Band Question.
Representative of the old band have
called upon the chairman of the city
board and requested that the ques
tion of them levying a tax for the pur
pose of supporting a small band in
this city be brought to a vote. The
boys do not want a big band, probably
about fifteen pldbes, and the spring
election will furnish the people an op
portunity/ Lo decide whether they
want Canton to have a band for spe
cial ocasious and weekly concerts or
not. Every little town in the country
will have a. band as usual and we
might as well have one as everyone
will help pay instead of Just the busi
ness men. In order that all may un
derstand we herewith publish the
text of the law passed by the last re
gular session of the state legislature,
permitting cities to levy a one mill
tax for the purpose of supporting a
city band.

taxes shall be made, tnere shall be
filed with the city council, or commis
sioners of such city, or board of trus
tees of such incorporated town, a pe

_per cent of the electors thereof, as
shown by the vote for members of the
city councilor commissioners or board
of trustees at the last proceeding an
nual election held in such city or
town, and requesting that the levying
of said tax be submitted to the elec
tors thereof at the next general elec
tion preceding the meeting of the city
council, board of commissioners or
board of trustees held for the purpose
of making ttta annual appropriation,

electors of such city or town voting
at such election shall vote in favor of
such proposition, then the levy of said
tax shall be deemed authorized, other
wise no such levy shall be made here
in.
Said tax shall be used for no other
purpose than hereinbefore provided.
Said tax levy shall be made by said
city council, or said board of commis
sioners, at their first regular meeting
in September, and by the board of
trustees before the third Tuesday in

The Newspaper Law.
During the past two months we
have sent out a number of subscrip
tion statements and while tbe re
sponse has been generous still there
area number from whom we have
not heard.
Few readers of newspapers fully un
derstand the law governing subscrip
tions. Below are the decisions ok the
United States Supreme Court upon
the subject:
Subscribers who do not give express
notice to the contrary are considered
as wishing to renew their subscrip
tion.
If the subscribers order a dIsoon
tiuuaioe publishers may continue to
send them until all dues are paid.
If subscribers continue to take the
periodicals from tbe post office to
which it was directed, he is responsi
ble until he has settled' his .bill and
ordered the paper discontinued.
If subscribers move to other places
without informing the publteiher and
the papers are sent to the former ad
dress, the subscriber is held respon
sible.
The court has held that the refusal
to take the periodicals from th*e post
office, or removing and.leaving them
uncalled for is prima facie evidence of
Intention to defraud.
If subscribers pay in advance they
are bound to give notice at tbe end of
time if they do not wish to continue
taking it, otherwise tbe publisher is
authorized to send it, and tbe sub
scriber will be responsible until ex
press notice with payment of all ar
rearages Is made.

THE
PAPER WITH.
SURVEY OF ROAD MATERIALS
OF SOUTH DAKOTA IS PLAN
State University Engineer Says
This Should Be First Step.
Vermillion, February 24—Thatthere
must be a thorough investigation of
road materials in South Dakota pre
liminary to any comprehensive plan
for the development of the highways
of tbe State is the conviction of Prof.
J. Maughs Brown of the College of
Engineering at the University of
South Dakota. Little Is known at
present, says Professor Brown, about
the location and nature of the avail
able road material of South Dakota.
South Dakota, like other states, must
make tbe best possible use of its own
natural resources fur road building
and in order to do that the people of
the state should know what hose re
sources are and wbt re bey can 'oe
found.
Gravel and sand-clay surfacing are
the most practical for the roads of
the state. There is very little brok
en stone within the borders of South
Dakota and concrete and macadam
are out of the question for state roads
except for very short strips. Tbe
cost of $10,000 to 113,000 a mile for
concrete makes it for the most part
prohibitive and macadam is only
slightly cheaper when upkeep is con
sidered. It is difficult, however, to
get gravel and sand-clay in many
parts of the state, especially where
little or no attempt has been made to
discover or tap the deposits.
iThe College of EnKinverlnt* is at
present testing materials from dif
ferent sections of th3 state, and is
proposing to undertake a survey for
tbe definite purpose of determining
the location and nature of South
Dakota's road materials.

CANTON, SOUTH DAKOTA, FRIDAY. MARCH 3, 191«.
Watch For Thumps In Early Pigs.
Thumps is quite a common disease
in young pigs, particularly in the win
ter and early spring. Thumps very
seldom, if ever, attacks a litter in the
summer time, when the sow has
plenty of range and the little pigs
follow her, thereby getting the neces
sary exercise to keep them in good
health. But with the litter farrowed
early in ttie spring, when the winter
weather is cold and it Is impossible to
turn them out, other measures must
be taken to insure that they have
proper exercise, enforced if necessary.
If weather conditions are such that
the sow and pigs cannot be turned
out, a good plan is to put the little
pigs outside of the pen, and in runn
ing around trying to get hack in, they
will get the exercise that they need.
The direct cause of thumps Is an
Irritated condition of the nerves lead
ing to the diaphragm. The diaphragm
is the fan-shaped muscle, which separ
ates the organs of tbe abdominal cavi
ty from those of the chest. This con
dition is caused principally by diges
tive disorders, overloading of the
stomach, and lack of exercise. In hog
cholera, thumping often develops as
a complication late In the course of
tbe disease.
Watch the little pigs carefully, as
thumps is nearly always fatal, and
always leaves them stunted when re
covery does occur. Medicine is hard
to gife, and is not satisfactory.—By
W. J. Wilson, Assitant in Serum Pro
duction. State College.
KNOW VALUE OF FRESH AIR
People Realize Its Importance, and
Also the Necessity for Cultivation
of Proper Breathing.
The open air theory for the benefit
of tuberculosis is a comparatively re
cent thought. The story Is that Doc
tor Trudeau recognized that he had
this dread and common disease, and
grasped at the open air life as his last
and only hope. When he sought the
mountains near Saranac, determined
to live in the open air, his course was
viewed as suicidal. Fellow physicians
thought that excessive fear of death
had robbed him of his medical Judg
ment. All his friends looked for an
early end.
Doctor Trudeau not only regained
his health, but he gained a better
measure of health than he had ever
enjoyed before. Then Je began to
send back to the cities tor working
men and working women, and cottages
were built out of the trees of the hills,
and an open air colony started. This
was the first in this country, and the
date was 1884. Ten year^later he es
tablished the first American laboratory
tor the study of consumption. In a re
markable propaganda against the
white plague undertaken in Detroit it
Is written: "So great a change has
come over the country In 30 years
that fresh air is on the verge of be
coming popular. One of the most
noted of modern medical men, open
ing his comprehensive treatise on the
preservation of human efficiency and
health, begins with fresh air.
"Now, the common form of tubercu
losis is the pulmonary form—the form
which attacks the lungs. Lungs pre
suppose breathing, and breathing pre
supposes air. Tuberculosis belongs to
the class of impure air diseases. Its
commonest1» method of Infection is
through the breathing, its commonest
point of attack the organ used in
breathing. We don't breathe with the
nose we breathe through it. We
breathe with the lungs. The quality
of our breathing—that is, the depth
and strength and fullness of It—is
quite as important a factor in the his
tory of health or of tuberculosis as
the quality of the air which we
breathe."
Hard Luck, Indeed.
"What is a fellow to do, I'd like to
know?" complained John. "The kids
that mamma don't object to me play
ing with all have mammas that won't
let them play with me."
Every Little Help«.
It you can't plant a shade tree your
self, you can at least refrain from
hitching a hungry horse to your neigh
bor's.—Ft. Wayne News.
Such Are Women's Ways.
"Women viewing another woman's
wedding presents say things which are
liable to be misinterpreted," said a
Chicago detective, who is usually de
tailed to guard the presents at big
weddings, "and other things which no
favorable interpretation would make
complimentary to the bride or to the
givers. It's the way of the sex, I sup
pose. Now, why is it that the most
common remark of the women who
to
this
inspecting the layout of silver and
other gifts more or less useful is
'what a lot of presents she got 7" Of
course, they vary the remark. 'What
a lucky girl!' says one, as If she would
like to add, 'some persons hare too
much luck.' Now, these women do
not mean any harm. It's just their
way of expressing admiration, usually.
But there *re others who surely
evince an uncharitable, petty spirit.
They pick up and examine every ar
ticle, and appraise it in loud whispers.
They express voluble wonder as to
whether the silver is solid, and doubt
the genuineness of the cut glass. Even
it they like a thing they will decide
that it wont wear welL And so the
tongues Wäg." J|§

FIRST WEEK IN MARCH TO BE
FOR BABIES.
Four Hundred Communities in the
United States Preparing For It
Says Childrens' Bureau.
State health officials also, it Is as
serted are giving It their active co
operation. 300,000 children less than
a year old die annually. "If children
are well born and well cared for the
Infant mortality will be negltble."
The Childrens' Bureau was estab
lished under Mr. Taft'a administra
tion. It's origin may be traced to the
conference on child welfare held In
tbe White House under Mr. Roose
velt's administration. The principal
work of the Bureau has been done
under tbe administration of Presi
dent Wilson.
The facts about American babies,
the needs of American babies and
America's responsibility to her babies
will this year be known as never be
fore, because the tirst week In March
will be Baby Week throughout the
country says Miss Julia Lathrop,
chief of the Children's Bureau of the
Department of Labor.
The Baby Week idea, according to
the Childrens Bureau, originated in
Chicago about two years ago. Then
New York had a Baby Week and also
Pittsburg and other cities. Such pra
tical benefit has in each case resulted
that tbe General Federation of Wo
men's clubs has undertaken to pro­
_Departwent of History
mote this nation wide observance.
The Childrens Bureau believes that
Baby Week will give more parents a
chance to learn the accepted princi
ples of infant care aud will awaken
every American to his responsibility
for the death of three hundred thou
sand babies, who according to the
census report die every year before
they are twelve months old.

WITH AN AIR RIFLE
A man may be a patriot
And go to war
And want to help his country,
But if he carries an air rifle he
won't do much good.
Likewise the city boosters.
They may do a lot of verbal boost
ing.
But if they send their money away
for things they could buy here, they'll
be shooting with an air rifle—shooting
mostly hot air.
It takes practical boosting to build
a bigger, better, 'fast-growing city, and
of ALL boosting, the most practical
boosting is the keeping of your money
in circulation in Canton, and South
Dakota, by giving Canton merchants
the business you have to give.
Ever think about that kind of
boosting?
