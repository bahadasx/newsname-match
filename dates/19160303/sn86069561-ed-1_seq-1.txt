THE effect of the great war on
Men's Clothing will be felt
this spring still more next fall.
We have had to buy with greater care and discrimination
than ever, to protect our customer against poor fabrics
That's why we appreciate having a line of medium
priced clothes for men and young men jthat is absolutely de
pendable Clothcraft
Every piece of cloth that enters the factory is tested me
chanically to determine its strength and chemically to prove
its ingredients. This is but the first of a long series of safe
guards that protect Clothcraft values
But donrt wait too long, there'll be greater demand this
spring for nationally known value like Clothcraft. Buy early

A GOOD BILL.
W. J. Sparks, of Mt. Vernon,
head of the Eastern Route of the
Dixie Highway, and one of tlie
promoters of the scenic Souther'
automobile tour, is m Frankfort
in the interest of good roads leg
islation.
One of the bills Mr Sparks pat
ticularly h urging, gives the Statt
Road Commissioner authority t
designate the route for State air
when the Fiscal Court can not or
will not select one. Mr. Spark
said that Knox, Laurel and Rock
castle are being delayed by reason
of Fiscal Court disagreemant over
the roads to be improved, and
Laurel has been- held back nearly
a year.
It frequently occurs, he said,
that local influence almost compels
a magistrate to hold out tor the
improvement of some unimportant
section of a road that passes some
body's farm, while other Magis
trates are subjected to pressure in
other quarters'and among them
they would fritter a, bond issue
away on patch work to the neglect
of the" main thoroughfares. He
said he believed many Magistrates
would be glad- to have this relief
The bill-gives the"!Fiscal Court
full freedom to act; but when the
Magistrates'disagree or a percent
age of the citizens unite.in peti
tioning for a "certain route, the
Road Commissioner is 'made ref
eree. (State Journal, F.rankfort.)

short time the spring sunshine will
come, the iarmers will begin to

Now that the ground hog ques
tion is to be settled by the legisla
ture, our mind can be at ease on
that question, as for some time
past the American people have
been divided in their opinion as
to the influence that the ground
hog-had; over tHe weather, and
our old friend, Maret, has pointed
out the outcome. We are satisfied
and will take the weather just as
it comes, and as it Is "to be fixed

truly there is -one thing we would
like'to hear and that is the' debate
on -both sides of this question.

DIXIE HIGHWAY
ROUTE INDOUBT
Nashville Chattanooga
Link Is Blocked
Tourists May Be Sent
Eastern Way-
Over
A special dispatch from Chatta
nooga appeared in Monday's Cour
ier Journal, with the above heading
at top of the column of matter in
the message. "Facing the pros
pect of having to route the Dixie
Highway travel on the eastern di
vision of the highway from India
napolis to Cincinnati and thence
outh through the Blue Grass
(Lexington, Richmond, Mt.Ver
non, London, Corbin, Cumberland
Gap) and Cumberland mountains,
jist because two or three counties
between Chattanooga have not
lined up to their pledges to the
Dixie Highway Association at the
time the highway was designed
Unless these counties give positive
guarantee that they will taue care
of their section of the highway,
the directors of the Association at
their meeting in Macon, Ga., on
March 25th, will be asked to re
locate the highway between those
points.
The Chattanooga Club, which
was largely responsible for the
Dixie Highway movement i- plan
ning an extensive publicity cam
paign, directing tourists Irom the
North over the eastern division of
the .highway from Cincinnati to
Chattanooga, which has been
amply provided for, until such a
time when the Nashville-Chattanooga
road is ready for travel."
It is up to the caunties of Rock
castle. Laurel and Knox to "get a
hustle" on, and do about forth
with. This is an oportunity tha
should not be overlooked to catch
tnis -;reat flow of travel, which can
be done by the early completion
of the highway through these
three counties. All th,e other
links will be closed by or the mid
dles oi this summer. Every officer
and citizen of the three counties
should take immediate interest in
I he work and aid. encourage and
push the construction, to an early
completion. Immediately after
the highway is ready for travel a
good income is assured, especially
to the mountain section, from
tourists, who will travel over this
great trunk line by hundreds
every week thru,out the year.
This income from the tourists, in
addition to the many great advan
tages to be derived by our citizens
from the good roads will add very
materially to the prosperity of the
mountains.
Let everyone boost.
COLDS QUICKLY RELIEVED.
