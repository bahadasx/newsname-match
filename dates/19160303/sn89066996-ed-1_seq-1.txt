Annual Bureau Meeting
The annual business meeting of the
St. Francois County Farm Bureau
took place on Friday afternoon at the
conclusion of the program of the
County Mass Meeting. About fifty
men were present for the business
session, and as it was very late in the
afternoon, nothing was done but to
elect the officers and directors for the
coming year. The officers elected
were as follows:
Mr. W. H. Smollinger, president.
Mr. W. E. Matkin, 1st vice pres.
Mr. Robt. Sellors, 2nd vice pres.
Directors:
Will Kinkead, Libertyville.
Will London, Farmington.
John Rion, Farmington.
J. H. Shaner, Bismarck.
Lee Welker, Farmington.
This gives the Farm Bureau an en
tirely new set of Directors and with
out question the farmers interested
in the welfare of the Farm Bureau
have chosen very wisely. All of
these men are interested in the future
of the Farm Bureau and will be will
ing and anxious to do all they can to
continue and further the splendid work
already done by this organization.
750 Members for the County Farm
Bureau
At the conclusion of the address
on the County Farm Bureau, deliv-
ered Friday afternoon by Sam Jor-
don, a campaign was inaugurated,
the object of which being to secure!
750 members for the County Farm
Bureau. Membership cards were cir-!
culated at that time and practically
every man present became a member
of the St. Francois County Farm Bu
reau. This campaign will be contin
ued and an effort will be made to so
licit for membership every farmer
and business man in the county.
The Farm Bureau as an organiza
tion is either justified or it is not.
It has been in existence long onough
for the people of the county to know
whether or not it is an organization
worth perpetuating. If it is not
then it had better be abolished. If
it presence is justified, then it de
serves the loyal support of every man
in the county. The Farm Bureau is
the only organization that we have
that is county-wide in its interests.
As suggested by our motto, "Bet
ter Farming, Better Stock, Better
LiviiiT." it stands for all things that
make for better community welfare.
It aims to serve both the individual
and the croups and one as well as the
($ier. The morexmembcrs we have,
tfie more efficiently can we do the
work that is ours to accomplish.
ST. FRANCOIS COUNTY
FARM BUREAU
BERT L. FRANCE
Farm Adviser
It may well be asked as to what this
organization can accomplish. A strong
county organization can encourage
and insist upon favorable legislation
in State and National government
that the idividual cannot do.
A county organization can create
better social 'conditions in tho coun
try. A county organization can adver
tise and distribute the products of its
members to better advantage than
the individual can do.
These and many others are the re
sults attained by county units when
they are active.
There will no doubt be men who will
not get direct material benefit that
can be measured in dollars and cents.
Others and many will get just such
assistance as this. But, however,
that may be, all will get the benefit
of a better community in which to
live. In every community there may
be men who are prospering and are
the best of managers and who per
haps cannot gain any direct material
assistance that will make their farm
ing business pay better.
If they have the correct attitude
toward community welfare, they will
encourage the Farm Bureau move
ment for what it will do for their
neighbor. And no one can deny but
what there are many people who can
and are getting valuable assistance
from this organization.
As one travels over the county and
sees still a great deal cf poor .stock
still a great deal of poor farming,
and worst of all the unsatisfactory
conditions of many of the public
roads, many of the schools, and many
of the homes, which all together are
unfavorable to the best community
welfare, then he becomes convinced
that some person or some organiza
tion has a big job to do. The func
tion of the Farm Bureau then being
to improve these conditions and ev
eryone being anxious that these con
ditions shall be improved, then let
every business man both in town and
in the country ally themselves with
this organization and the more quick
ly and effectively bring into existence
in this county the strongest county
unit in the State.
We desire that all members of the
Farm Bureau have their names on
these membership cards, so all of the
old mebers are requested to sign one
of these cards as soon as convenient.
The dues will continue the same
$1.00 per year, due the first of each
March. It is hoped that every mem
ber will be a booster for more mem
bers. Cards may be secured at the of
fice of the County Agent.
The new members will bo published
in the local papers each week. The
men and their addresses who have
already signed up are as follows:
C. L. Alexander, Farmington.
W. D. Ashburn, Farmington.
J. C. Ballard, Libertyville.
F. II. Best, Farmington.
Albert BelHn. Knob Lick.

Involving the Ownership of Certain
Shares of Doe Run Lead Co.
Capital Stock
The case of Robert Holmes against
the Doe Run Lead Company, which
was a mandamus proceeding to compel
the officers of the Doe Run Lead
Company to transfer certain 23
shares of capital stock of the Doe
Run Company, held by one Montgom
ery on the books of the Comapny, to
the name of Robert Holmes, was tried
last Friday and Saturday in the Cir
cuit Court.
It seems that several years ago
these 23 shares were owned by one
Rickard, and were hypothecated with
the National Bank of Commerce of
St. Louis to secure a loan made by
the Bank to Rickard; and it develop.
cd that Rickard had an agreement
with the bank that this stock should
be transferred or should be delivered
to the St. Joe Lead Company, and
that that Company should issue stock
of the St. Joe Lead Company in lieu
of the Doe Run Lead Company stock
in accordance with a certain plan of
consolidation theretofore made. It
afterwards developed that the pledgor
of this stock became a fugitive from
justice, and the bank to protect it
self caused the stock to be issued in
the name of Montgomery; that Mont
gomery did not enter into a similar
agreement with the bank and the St.
Joe Lead Company that Rickard had
entered into; that after this note had
become due the National Bank of
Commerce advertised this stock un
der its collateral agreement for sale
at the East Court House Door in the
City of St. Louis. On the day of sale
Robert Holmes' representative was
present and purchased the stock.
Thereafter he made a demand on the
officers of the Doe Run Lead Com
pany to transfer this 23 shares of the
capital stock of the Doe Run Lead
Company from Montgomery to
Holmes, which the Doe Run Lead
Company officials declined to do up
on the advice of counsel.
The Doe Run Lead Company, by its
answer, admitted that the 23 shares
of stock were outstanding and be
longed to someone, and that they
were ready and willing to issue said
23 shares to the rightful owner, but
suggested that the St. Joseph Lead
Why a Baby Week?
A Baby Week is a campaign for
a two-fold purpose:l. To give the pa
rents of a community the opportun
ity of learning the most important
facts with regard to the care of the
baby. 2. To bring home to the com
munity a knowledge of the facts re
garding the needless deaths of the
babies, and a realization of the ways
in which it must protect them.
Baby Week is a national affair
and it should be a matter of interest
to the whole community.
Conservation.
We are conserving our forests, our
mines, our water power. What are
we doing to conserve human life, our
greatest national asset?
Is this conservation worth while?
If so, let us work for better woman
and child legislation, expert labra
tory service, State traveling infants
welfare exhibits.
Is it worth while to us as a city?
If so, let us pass and enforce ordi
nances for clean streets and allevs:
and infant welfare stations.
Infant Mortality.
Do you know that in the United
States 124 out of every 1,000 regis
tered babies die?
What is the death rate in Farm
ington ?
What is being done to lower the
death rate?
Can we not strive to maVe th
death rate here the lowest of am-
community of its size in the country ?
The problem of infant mortility it
a most urgent one. Its scope is
world-wide, and on its partial solu
tion, at least, depends the welfare of
posterity.
The causes of infant mortalitv are
mainly the result of three conditions
poverty, jgn' rnne and nole-t
Company be directed to come into
court and interplead, and as grounds
therefor stated that the agreement
between Rickard and the National
Bank of Commerce on the one hand,
with the officers and directors of the
St. joe Lead Company on the other
hand, was that the holder and owner
of these 23 shares were by virtue of
the agreement aforesaid obligated to
surrender the 23 shares of Doe Run
Lead stock and take therefor their
pro-rata of the St. Joe Lead Com
pany stock.
It was shown by the evidence on
the part of Mr. Holmes that he did
not know anything about any agree
ment between the National Bank of
Commerce and the pledgor of this
stock with anybody; he bought the
Btock at the foreclosure sale. It was
further shown that the Cashier of the
National Bank of Commerce of St
Louis by letters stated to Mr. Guy
Fisher, the broker who purchased the
stock for Mr. Holmes, and to Mr.
B. H. Marbury, the attorney for Mr.
Holmes, that at the time of the no
tice of sale, and at no other time:
was the said National Bank of Com
morce obligated by any contract
whatever not to sell the same. It
was further shown by Mr. Holmes
himself that he knew nothing about
an alleged contract, and bought the
stock without notice and in good
faith; and it was further shown by
him on cross-examination that the
reason he purchased this stock was
that he owiters of the majority stock
of the- St. Jee Lead Company, under
their re-organization scheme, had
agreed and- did put Mr. Holmes on the
Board of Directors, but that when he
was unwilling to reduce the wages of
the laboring men unless the wages of
men higher up were reduced, and for
other reasons, testified to, he was left
off the board; and that thereafter, to
protect his interests in the Doe Run
Lead Company, he purchased this
stock.
After hearing all the evidence and
the argument of the attorneys the
Court decided to order the St. Joseph
Lead Company to interplead on or be
fore March 20, 1916, and then contin
ued, the case over to the next regu
lar May term, 1916.

Kerous; pacifiers are both needless
and injurious; a baby needs rest and
regular hours of sleeping, and should
not be kept up late or handled too
much.
The baby is like a little plant; he
must have fresh air and sunlight. He
will droop and die if kept in a close,
dark room, deprived of nature's best
health tonics fresh air and sun
light. Every baby's birth should bo reg
istered. A certificate of birth will be
necessary for school attendance, go
ing to work, inheritance and citizen
ship. Every man and woman, whether the
parents of a baby or not, should know
what their own health department is
doing.
Infant mortality is the most sens
itive index we possess of social wel
fare and a sanitary administration.

The Democratic Central Commit
tee of St. Francois County met in
Farmington on Wednesday, March 1,
1916, all members of the committee
present, to take action on plan of
electing delegates to the State Dem

St. Francois county, who are inter
ested in caring for homeless chil
dren, or :';,-( ' a have lost they
parents, will be glad to know that the
Home is receiving substantial support
from the State at large. During the
experimental days of establishing the
Home, no special solicitation for sup
port of the Home has been made in
our local communities. Many gener
ous individuals have given produce
and some money to the Home, but no
effort has been made to draw the
support of the Home from the city or '
county. The Board of Trustees has '
felt that the support of the Home
must come from the State at large,
and now, after a number of months, j
we have found that generous Presby-1
terians over the State are glad and
willing to support such an institution
that will care for homeless children, j
Besides the gifts for the running ex- j
penses of the institution, two thou- j
sand dollars have been given and
spent on improvements on the prop- j
erty.
Having passed the experimental
stage, the Home is now preparing to
go forward in its helpful mission. To

The Home is Presbyterian only as
to the control of it, and children from
every church or no church are re

children that have been received and
cared for up to the present, twenty
have come from St. Francois county.
If some of the encumbrances can be
removed soon, additional improve
