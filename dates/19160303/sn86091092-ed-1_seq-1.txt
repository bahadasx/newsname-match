CEED 350
The membership committee of the
Commercial club is enthusiastic and
highly gratified over the success of
the campaign to increase the club
membership to 300 "live o«es" and de
clare that an effort wil be made to
present 175 applications at the next
regular meeting. The committee
plans on closing the active campaign
for members Tuesday, March 14, in
order that all applications may be vot
ed on at the club meeting that night.
"The reception accorded the com
mittee in its solicitation was extreme
ly gratifying," declared J. M. Lewis,
chairman. "Everywhere we were giv
en encouragement and I for one found
the work most pleasant. Those on
whom we called knew, apparently,
what we were after for in no case
were we required to spend valuable
time in explaining and re-explaining
the objects of the campaign. In the
majority of cases the applications
were voluntary, the only effort on the
part of the committee being to hand
an application blank to the prospec
tive member.
"A particularly pleasing "feature of
the work was the general feeling of
good will displayed by the citizens of
Caldwell and surrounding country
towards the club and its work. Words
of commendation were frequent and
sincere. We found that the citizen
sliip of Caldwell is proud of its Com
mercial club and has confidence in its
ability to successfully conclude any
matter of importance to the communi
ty undertaken. The same feeling of
confidence prevails among the farmers
with whom we came into contact.
"The complete success of the mem
bership campaign is not due entirely
to the efforts of the committee for a
meed of credit is due individual mem
bers who were quite as active as the
committeemen, several handing in
four or five applications. We have ap
proximately 100 people yet to call on
and wc shall endeavor to see them all
before the next regular meeting. An
earnest endeavor will be more to in
crease the membership to 350 by that
time," Mr. Lewis concluded.
The membership committee in ad
dition to Mr. Lewis includes E. A.
Wheeler. Dan Banks, P. V. Kelly and
A. F. Stone.

JAPAN IN SONG AND STORY
GIRLS' GLEE CLUB CONCERT
A novel entertainment is that to be
presented next Monday night, March
6th. by the Girls' Glee Club of the
College of Idaho. It is the Club's an
nual concert and will be given at the
Huree theatre. The admission price
is low, 35 cents, and the proceeds, as
usual, will be devoted to the interests
of music at the College. The orogram
consists of four distinct groups
selections concerning Japan, and it
will be found attractive and varied
enough for all tastes. The entire pro
gram is to be given in costume and
with action, which will lend added in
terest to the music. In addition to
the attractive numbers for the choru9,
which includes, scenes from the ever
popular oper'a of "The Mikado,"
there will be special features in the
singing of Mrs. F. F: Beale and Mr.
Arthur Binford and in the dramatic
rendering by Miss Helen Case of the
charming play, Madame Butterfly.
These numbers alone should attract a
large audience, and it is believed the
part by the club will be no less worth
hearing. An unusual feature connect
ed with the concert, too, is the offer
by the Mens' Glee Club to sell tickets

the A. T. Vallentine place, near Lake
Lowell, was shot and instantly killea
about 7:30 Wednesday evening by
Ernest B. Hardenburg, foi mer hus
band of Mrs. Richardson. Harden
burg took several shots at Mrs. Rich

Brooks, but none of the shots took ef
fect on either of the women. Har
denburg fled from the scene of his
crime to Caldwell. He gave himself
up to Nightwatch Dan Sluiee and he
is now in the custody of Sheriff Fro
man.
Hradenburg had been feeding sheep
near Meridian. He drove to the Rich
ardson home in a livery rig and pre
tended to be selling soap. When Rich
ardson admitted him to the kitchen
he addressed Mrs. Richardson in a
familiar manner, which Richardson
resented. A quarrel followed, in which
Hardenburg drew a revolver and shot
Richardson, killing him instantly.
Saved by Flight.
Mrs. Richardson fled to the front
of the house when Hardenburg op
ened lire on her, but her sister, Miss
Brooks, grappled the shooter and
succeeded to deflecting his aim until
the cylinder of his revolver was emp
ty. Hardenburg then beat her over
the head with the weapon and fled.
Miss Brooks ran to the house of a
bachelor about half a mile distant,
who assisted her to the home of ano
ther neighbor, where she was cared
for.
Former Residents of Boise.
The actors in the tragedy are not
well known in Caldwell. Mr. and Mrs.
I Hardenburg formerly lived in Boise.
It is said that Hardenburg was arrest
ed abou' January 1, 1915, for beating
his wife.
Richardson is a printer and was
once employed by the Symms-York
company in Boise. He was a widower
with several children when he married

her third husband, so it is stated, her
first husband, Charles Harder, being
dead.
Richardson was 27 years old. His
wife is 40 and Hardenburg is 33.

College Clean Up Day.
A person has many ideas and some
are verv foolish but we do not con
r this as a very bad idea. Suppose
that on April the 28th that the college
students have a half holiday and clean
up the college campus. Let us call
this the "College Clean Up Day." Let
evefy person who wants to come to
school that day don a pair of over
alls. This is the suggestion of the
College labrarian and the College re
porter. A student can come to school
and go to his classes or he can put his
hour's work on the grounds of the
school. The main reason is that the
College perhaps needs to clean up a
little before the "Founders' Day"
celebration and that the college peo
ple are going to make this vear's
Founders' Day the school's biggest
event of this vcar. Think this over
and ask the librarian and reporter
about it.

VASHINGTONS FAREWELL
ADDRESS APPLICABLE
TO THE PRESENT
I have just been reading portions
Washington's Farewell Address to
American People when withdraw
ng to private life. If he had spoken
words yesterday they could not be
more appropriate for the national
d of the hour. Among other things
said :
Observe good faith and justice to
ard all nations, cultivate peace and
harmony with all. Religion and
morality enjoin this conduct; and
an it be that good policy does not
ually enjoin it? It will be worthy
a free, enlightened and at no dis
ant period a great nation to give to
mankind the magnanimous and too
novel example of a people always
guided by an exalted justice and
nevolence.
Who can doubt, but in the course
time and things, the fruits of such
_ plan would richly repay and tem
porary advantages which might be lost
by a steady adherence to it; can it be
that Providence has not connected
permanent felicity of a nation
ith its virtue? The experiment, at
least, is recomemnded by every senti
ment which ennobles human nature.
Mas, is it rendered impossible by its
ices?
In the execution of such a plan
thing is more essential than that
permanent, inveterate antipathies
against particular nations and passion
ate attachments for others should be
-xcluded; and that, in place of them,
just and amicable feeling toward all
should be cultivated.
Antipathy in one nation against an
other disposes each more readily to
offer insult and injury, to lay hold
of slight causes of umbrage, and to
be haughty and intractable when ac
cidental or trifling occasion of dis
pute occur. Hence frequent collisions,
obstinate, envenomed and bloody
contests.
The nation, prompted bv ill will
and restentment, sometimes imocls to
war the government, contrary to the
best calculations of policy. The gov
rnment sometimes participates in the
national propensity and adopts
through passion what reason would
reject; at other times it makes the
animosity of the nation subservient
to projects of hostility, instigated by
pride, ambition and other sinister and
pernicious motives. The peace often,
sometimes perhaps the liberty of na
tions, has been the victim.
The great rule of conduct for us in
regard to foreign nations is. in ex
tending our commercial relations, to
have with them as little political con
nection as possible.
Europe has a set of primary inter
ests which to us have none or a very
remote relation. Hence she must be
engaged in frequent controversies,
the causes of which are essentially
foreign to our concerns. Hence,
therefore, it must be unwise in us to
implicate ourselves by artificial ties in
the ordinary vicissitudes of her poli
tics or the ordinary combinations and
ollisions of her friendships or enmi
ties.
Our detached and distant situation
invites and enables us to pursue a
different course. If we remain one
people, under an efficient government,
the period is not far off when we
may defy material injury from ex
ternal annoyance; when we may take
such an attitude as will cause the
neutrality we may at any time resolve
upon to be scrupulously respected;
when belligerent nations, under the
impossibility of making acquisitions
upon us, will notl ightly hazard giving
us provocation.
Why forego the advantages of so
peculiar a situation? Why quit our
own to stand upon foreign ground?
Why. by interweaving our destiny
with that of any part of Europe, en
tangle our peace and prosperity in
tiie toils of European ambition, rival
ship, interest, humor or caprice?
Harmony and a liberal intercourse
with all nations are recommended by
policv, humanity and interest.
