Interesting Questions and Answers
for the Voters of Vermont.
By W. J. Van Patten, Ex-Senator, Burlington, Vt.
How many towns in Vermont have licensed liquor saloons ? 14
How many do not license them? 232
How many no-saloon towns have druggist license to sell liquor on a doc
tor's prescription? 7
How many towns have no druggist licenses? 234
How many towns have hotels with liquor licenses? 12
How many towns where hotels have no liquor licenses? 234
How many hotels in the State have a license? 17
How many hotels that have no licenses? Over 100
Where are the best hotels located? Mostly in no-license towns.
(Waterbury, Woodstock, St. Johnsbury, Brattleboro,
Manchester, Springfield, Bellows Falls, and many others.)
Which hotels have the best automobile tourists traffic? In proportion
to the size of the town, no-license hotels.
What proportion of automobile tourists prefer to stop at liquor selling
hotels? Not 10.
What brings most of the automobile tourists to Vermont? The glori
ous Green Mountains that God placed here, and all our
beautiful scenery.
Will it make a difference with the automobile tourists if the 17 hotels
now having license fail to get another license? Hardly; these
tourists want good roads and good food not whiskey.
Should we legislate to satisfy the liquor craving of less than ten per
cent of the automobile tourists? No!
To whom do the licensed hotels sell the most of their liquor? To the
young men of Vermont.
Do the citizens of no-license towns complain because their druggists can
not sell alcohol and other liquors? They do not.
Do physicians complain because these druggists do not sell liquors?
Very seldom, if ever.
Can druggists and physicians buy and keep alcohol and other liquors for
proper use in compounding medicines for the use of the sick and of the
aged and feeble? They can.
How can the druggists furnish alcohol to be used for external purposes?
By having it compounded with a little arnica, witch-hazel
or other appropriate remedy.
What can be used for spirit lamps? Denatured alcohol, the same
as now. No law against that.
How can alcohol be procured for antiseptic purposes and for scientific
experiments? By ordering it from regular dealers in other
states. There is not and will not be any law, state or na
tional, against procuring it for these purposes, nor for the
use of any hospital, scientific school or institution.
What is the principal feature of the Perry Law? It extends the pres
ent law now in force in 232 no-license towns to 246 towns
that is, to the whole state. Nothing more or less.
