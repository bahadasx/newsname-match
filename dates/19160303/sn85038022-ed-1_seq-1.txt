Knhrlit Address Jlrrllngr.
The Woman's Club hold Its regular
monthly meeting Thursday In thn
Council Chnmbcr, Tho flrat nddrcsa
waa by Mrs. I'cddlconl of the loctil
City Mission, ho subject being "Social
Service." 8lio said in part:
"Tho scope of social servlco touches
every phase of society or tho commu
nity which haa to do with Its better
ment, viz. housing, sanitation, working
conditions, health, recreation, Juvenllo
delinquency nnd city administration.
These arc tho topics of Interest to the
social worker. You must also rely
upon other organized forces, viz. state
laws, city council, charity organiza
tions and churches all combine In the
solution of tho problems arising for
solution; co-operation In all thesti
lead to success. Tho value of social
service Is ita love for humanity. The
nlm of social service Is tho betterment
of the social body.
"Tho b.iBls for social service is the
need for material relief, viz. tho needs
of the body. Then real Investigation,
It means finding out from all sources
the conditions of the applicant to lw
helped. Next In line Is tho treatment.
A social worker must work with, not
merely for, n family. Tho caso may
present a dozen different problems and
they must bo solved separately. The
motto for social service is 'Ho took
him by the hand and lifted him up.'
"Co-operation, the watchword In the
business "world, must be In tho char
itable field. Welfare, constructive
work, means medical care, legal ad
vice secured, education, employment,
recreation and spiritual development.
We hnve a juvenile court but no pro
bation officer. Tho Influence of the
picture show, suggests that Friday
night bo children's night, showing of
"Cinderella," "The I'rjncc and the
Pauper," and other kindred pictures
She found ono house of eight rooms
housing four families, eight living In
two rooms; they cook, cat and sleep In
ono room. Twenty persons live In this
Jiousc and It yields a rental of $12
por month. Hotter housing demanded
because of its Influence on health nnd
homo life.
City aid, alms giving, should bo cen
tralized. All alms giving should come
through charities which have experi
enced social workers who glvo with a
constructive plan, making tho Inves
tigations and follow up tho case, in
order that families may bo lifted out of
their poverty Instead of tiding thorn
over.
Mrs. Peddlcord was followed by Mr.
Knight of Chattanooga, Tenn. Mr.
Knight laid tho conditions of Mays
vllle bare. He Insisted upon a sur
vey of tho city showing water and gns
mnlns, sewer pipes; location of all
these.
Mr. Knight should hnvo had 2G0 In
stead of twenty-five to hear his plain,
practical discussion of Maysvlllo.

THE HDME DF QUALITY CLOTHES
If there ever was a time for serious contemplation about clothes needs that
moment has arrived. If, next winter, you are asked to pay advances on clothes that
will strike you as steep, don't blame any retailer. Woolens have soared to unprec
edented heights; you know something about the wool situation yourself, by the way
it is selling here; dyestuffs are alarmingly scarce; trimmings have gone 'way up;
even labor is better paid than ever before.
