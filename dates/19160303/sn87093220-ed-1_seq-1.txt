THE ELECTION IS ANCIENT HISTORY
For Commission, 892—Against. 1,879; now sail in and elect the very best men, and let it go at that; then quit talking
politics, for it's the worst paying business in this world, and get down to business. Do not waste too much time in a
game where those elected to office are satisfied with a $25.00 a month job, and in some instances earn it.

Seattle Editor Gives Out
Forcible Interview
In East
IS ECONOMIC GOOD
Business Shows Big Im
provement in First
Six Weeks
That the "dry" law of this state
is effectual prohibition is declared by
Clarence Blethen, editor of the Seat
tle Times, in an interview given out
Feb. 15 in Kansas City and printed
jin the National Enquirer (Indianap
' oils) Feb. 17.
"My paper fought its hardest," says
Mr. Blethen, "against prohibition. We
fought it on economic grounds alone.
We believed that in a great seaport
jcity with a population of upward of
■ 300,000 prohibition would be destruc
tive; it would bring on economic dis
aster. We believed that under our
system of licensing saloons we had
the liquor traffic about as well con
trolled as it could be, and we wanted
to let it alone, and so we fought as
' hard as we cquld fight. But, in spite
'of all we could do against it, prohi
bition carried.
Business Expanded Quickly
"We already know that it Is a great
benefit, morally and from an economic'
standpoint. Its moral benefit has been
tremendous. Seattle had 260 saloons,
and we had an average of 2,000 arrests
a month for crimes and misdemeanors
I growing out of liquor drinking. In
January we had only 400 arrests and
sixty of those were made January 1,
and were the results of hangovers
from the old year. That in itself is
enough to convince any man with a
conscience that prohibition is neces
sary. There can be no true economy
in anything that is immoral.
"And on top of that great moral
result, we have these economic facts;
Jin the first three Veeks of January
I the savings deposits in the banks of
j Seattle increased 15 per cent. There
j was not a grocery store in Seattle
( that did not show an increase of busi
ness in January greater than ever
known in any month before in all the
history of the city, except in holiday
times. In all the large grocery stores
; the increase was immense. In addi
j tion to this every dry goods store ill
Seattle except one and that one I have
;no figures from, had a wonderful in
crease in business. Each store re
ported the largest business ever done
in one month, except in holiday time.

LIBRARY REPORT
SHOWS GROWTH
The report for 1915 by Miss Ida
L. Rliinehart, Carnegie public libra
rian, shows both that the library has
been well conducted and that the Ab
erdeen public is taking advantage of
the institution's facilities. Total of
books circulated In 1914 was 26,765;
in 1915, 32,789, of which 22,395 were
adult, the balance juvenile literature.
New patrons to the number of 830
were added, making the list now 2,-
840; 903 books were purchased and
93 were donated, while 104 were with
drawn from circulation. Expenditures
for the year were $896 for books;
$1145 for salaries, balance of the to
tal of $2,876 being for light, street
assessments, binding books, periodi
cals, supplies and Improvements.
VOLUME 30
goods the sales increased so greatly,
and so I sent to all the grocery and
' dry goods stores to find that out. And
|to me it is a-pitiful thing, and it
J makes me sorry that we did not have
i prohibition long ago—that the increase
in sales in all the dry goods stores
was in wearing apparel of women and
children and in the grocery stores the
increase was made up chiefly of fruits,
and fancy groceries. This proves that
it is the women and children who
suffer most from the liquor business,
and it is the women and children who
benefit greatest from prohibition.
Money that went formerly over the
bar for whiskey is now being spent
for clothing for the women and chil
dren and in better food for the house
hold.
"It is just like this: When you
close the saloons the money that form
erly was spent there remains in the
family of the wage earner and his
wife and children buy shoes and cloth
ing and better food with it. Yes, sir,
we have found in Seattle that it is
better to buy shoes than booze. The
families of wage earners in Seattle
are going to have more food and
clothes and everything else than they
had before."
It Actually Prohibits.
"And is the prohibition law en
forced?"
"Absolutely, Prohibition does pro
hibit." '
"Ahd how about the empty sajoona
and the landlords who own theft?"
"Many of them have already been'
made Qver and are occupied by other
businesses. I will venture the prophecy
that in one year from today you won't
be able to find a place in Seattle where
there was a saloon. They will be all
occupied by other businesses. And
prohibition has not lowered rents. I
know of one big dry goods store that
has already had its rent raised since
prohibition w en ( into effect. , *
Coast Will Bo "Pry. 1 ' __ J
"Oregon also went 'dry' January I.
California is the only 'wet' state left
' on the Pacific Coast, and it will go
'dry' January 1, 1918. And those three
states will remain 'dry' to the end ot
time. None of them would ever have
saloons again. Those who were hon
estly opposed, as I was. to prohibi
tion in Washington and Oregon, have
been converted to it, as I have been,
by the actual evidence that prohibition
Is a fine thing from a business stand
point. No city and no community,
too, can afford to have saloons. They
are too expensive, morally and eco
nomically. In a very few years there
will not be a licensed saloon in the
whole nation, and that will be a line
thing."
