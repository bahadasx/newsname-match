WASHINGTON, March 2. Out of a
day's developments in President Wil
son's fight with congress, crowded to
the utmost with elements of sensa
tional and dramatic, the administra
tion f'-rces in the senate tonight
emerged with pledges of enough vote:
to kill, once and for all, Sena'or Gore's
resolution to warn Americans off
armed ships of the European ' bellig
erents, and demonstrate that congress
.stands behind the president in his nego
tiations with Germany.
Action in the senate, it is believed,
will be followed promptly by stifling
of sentiment in the house against the
president's foreign policy.
In one of the greatest non-partisan
debates the senate has seen in years.
Chairman Stone of the foreign rela
tions committee declared he was not
in accord with the president; Senator
Lodge, the ranking republican, pledged
;rs support to the president's deter
mination to secure to Americans theii
lights on the high seas, and Senator
John Sharp Williams, just from a sick
bed, delivered a withering denuncia
tion of the president's opponent?.
The senate adjourned tintil tomor
row at 11 o'clock, when the adminis
tration leaders plan to bring up tTu

of it finally, as an embarrassment to
the president in his conduct of diplo

congressional leaders a week ago, has
been declared that Germany's insist

controversy probably would result in
a breach of diplomatic relations; that
a breach probably would be followed
by war. and that "a state of war might
not be of itself and of necessity an

Chairman Stone of the foreign re

the president never had stated 'to
him nor in his hearing that he be

thought that war between the I'nited
States and Germany would be desir
able or would result in good to the
United States. When the White

said, this statement was issued:
"When the attention of the White
House was called to certain state
ments in Senator Gore's speech this
afternoon, the president authorized an
unqualified denial of any utterance
to which any such meaning could be
attached."
It was explained on his behalf that
the president had told the congress
men he could not predict what would
follow a breaking off of diplomatic
relations and had expressed in the
most vigorous terms his hope that
the I'nited States would not be drawn
intu war- and his determination to
continue to bend his every effort to

It was understood the president,

NEW YORK, .March 2. Summons
served in person by Coroner Wagner
of Brooklyn commanding officers of
he navy ,ird to appear at the re
cent inquest over the victims of the
submarine E-2 should have been ig
nored. Secretary of the Navy Daniels
advised Rear Admiral I'sher, com
mandant ol the yard, by letter today.
"Since it appears," wrote the sec
retary, "that no deaths as a result
of the E-2 accident occurred outside
the , limits of the naval reservation,
the coroner was wholly without juris
diction to conduct any investigation
of the accident: that his subpoenas
in the case were of no legal force;
that obdenience thereto would not
have been authorized had all the
facts been known, and that the case
cannot be regarded as a precedent
lor the exercise of jurisdiction by the
coroner in cases of deaths occurring
therein."
Coroner Wagner insisted tonight
that he had acted, within his rights,
idding that a law passed in 1S5J gave
the state jurisdiction in such cases.

GERMANS RESUME THEIR

French War Office Issues
Statement Saying Infan
try Attacks of Extreme
Violence Were Put Down
by French Attack
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
The Germans have resumed their
heavy offensive in the region of Ver
dun, with the French everywhere
strongly opposing it. While over most
of the front from the east of the Mease
down into the Woevre region the Ger
man big guns have been active, around
Douaumont the Teutons launched sev
eral infantry attacks of extreme vio
lence. These, the French war office
declares, were put down by the French
troops, whose fire decimated the enemy
ranks.
Le Mort Somme. the Cote Du Poivre
and the Douaumont sector particularly
have suffered heavy bombardments.
Northeast of St. Mihiel the French guns
have been worked effectively against
the German positions, in the Alsace
in the region of Seppois a heavy artil
lery duel has been in progress.
The British among the Yprcs-Co-mines
canal have reversed the victory
gained over them by the Germans Feb
ruary 14 by retaking the 800 yards of
trenches which the Germans captured
at that time. The German mine gal
leries in the trenches were destroyed
and four officers and 176 men were
taken prisoners. In addition Irench
guns have destroyed a German work
in the region of Deuvraignes, which lies
between the Somme and Oise rivers.
The situation remains unchanged on
the Russian and Austro-Italian fronts.
In Asia the Russians are keeping tip
their strong offensive against the
Turks.
Nothing definite has transpired with
regard to the report that the German
commerce raider Moewe had been cap
tured and taken into Trinidad by Brit
ish cruisers. A dispatch from Trini
dad says nothing is known there con
cerning the Moewe.
The British admiralty has made
known its instructions to armed mer
chantmen. Armament is supplied to
such vessels, the instructions say,
"solely for the purpose of resisting at
tack by an armed enemy vessel and
must not be used for any other pur
pose whatsoever."
FRENCH DECIMATE ENEMY
PARIS, March 2. German at
tacks of great violence, both ar
tillery and infantry, have been re
pulsed to the nptrh of Verdun. The

furious infantry assaults have
been repulsed by the French
troops "whose fire decimated the
ranks of the enemy."

ol the Berliner Tageblatt, commenting j
on the Verdun battle, says the defen-
sive front of Verdun on the north and !
east has been reduced to about sixty j
square kilometers, which gives the Ger
mans an excellent advantage for their j
concentric artillery fire and the em
ployment of their troops.
The writer, according to the Over
seas News Agency, pays tribute to the
bravery of the French' troops in com
ing to "iron grips" with the Germans,
but says, "a race of military valor per
ishes before Verdun or drags itself
crippled home."
Mines Are Adrift.
LONDON. March 3. A Stockholm
dispatc.li to the Morning Post says that
according to a .message from Karls

several hundred mines is drifting from

adrift by the ice and wind.
The message adds that explosions are i
occurring hourly and that navigation in
the neighborhood of the Swedish is
lands is perilous.
In the interview with the Athens cor
respondent of the Chronicle, King Con

NEW YORK. March 2. The charge
that the cost of the $125,000 bonus
voted by the Interborough Rapid
Transit company to its president,
Theodore Shouts, in connection with
the negotiation of subway contracts
with the city of New York, was
eventually allowed by the public ser
vice commission as a city expense,
was made today at the investiga
tion of Rapid Transit affairs con
ducted by the Thompson legislative
committee.
The accusation was made by Frank
Moss, counsel for the committee, in
examining Alfred Craven, chief en
gineer of the commission. After
Craven's
Thompson
testimony. Chairman
said he would prepare
! charges of neglect of duty and mis
conduct against him.
Craven testified that the Interbor
ough submitted to the public ser
vice commission a bill for approx
imately $1. 500.000 for what was
termed "prior distribution charges"
and that this was cut to $125,000.
He did not explain what the bill
was for.
"Now. Mr. Craven, how does it
Mr. Shouts as bonus?"
"I ca.inot tell, the amount is just
fair allowance. I never heard of
Mr. Shouts' bonus until I read of it
in the newspapers." said Craven.
An investigation to determine
v hether any improper) charges had

iff. He killed the man and woman yes
terday morning. with an iron bar.
Then, not knowing what disposition
to make of the baby, killed it also.
After the murders had been commit
ted, Fortine was said to have fled from
the place. He returned again last night
and set fire to the ranch house in an
effort to hide all his wrong doings.
The fire was discovered by Frank
F.ustwood and C. Johnson, neighboring
j ranchers. They hurried to the place,
but found the blaze beyond their con-
trol. The charred bodies of Mr. and
Mrs. Furrer and their baby were found
i" the ruins.
Suspicion was aroused first because
of the fact that, from the appearance
of the bodies, the couple apparently
had been fully dressed, despite the fact
that the fire occurred late at night.
Fortine, the ranch hand, was ques
tioned. His answers, officers said, were
evasive and he was brought to the
Oxnard jail. After several hours of
questioning the prisoner was said to
have broken down, telling the entire
story of his crimes.

into the barn yesterday morning "1 hit
