The Cannery Proposition
Mrs. Clo.se is again agitating
tliu canning factory proposition.
She Is deserving of recognition
and assistance. It is the duty
of each inhabitant of the town
and valley to do his, or her part.
the town must keep on building
and the valley lie developed.
Each Improvement adds to the
value of all the property. We
must not liopo for others to do
all the improving if we can help
at all. Like the Lady's might,
mentioned in tho Bible. We do
not know how much our little
assistance might mean. The
writer once read of an attempt
to launch a monstrous vessel, in
olden times. The power was
insuflicient. The remark, "If
someone could push another
pound" bi ought to their assist
ance a near by boy, who declared
he could do that much. The
vessel was launched so the story
continues. Now any of us can
do ns much as a little boy, so
come on. Say, "1 will do all
that I can". Most everybody
seems willing. Wo seem now
only to lack a leader. Don't
wait for an opportunity to do
.something; but go and offer your
assistance, Like when a house
is on tire, if theres no chance to
help anybody, do something that
will bo an advantage to the town,
country or yourself. If you
help youreslf you help others.

The churchless town drifts rapidly i rito a
very undesirable place to live. Unrighteous
ness gains control of its government and sin is
winked at. The worst characters force their
way into society, often becoming the leaders
who arc idealized by our boys and girls.
If you would up-hold the moral standard
of the community, go to church next Sunday
and encourage the people who arc working for
the best interests of our young people.
Most if not all of you have come here to
better your conditions financially and make
homes for yourselves. Why not create a moral
atmosphere that is healthful for yourselves, and
in which your children grow morally strong.
The best way to do this is encourage the
churches and Sunday Schools.
Do not fail to attend
morning and evening.

Loyalty of the New Mexico Press

certain things that can be grown

conditions are peculiar and evoa
that no one can come to New
Mexico who has not enough to
keep him for three or four years
before he can expect to make

The record that is being made
