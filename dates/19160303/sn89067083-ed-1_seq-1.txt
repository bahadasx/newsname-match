Measles, A Difficult Prob
Pnrnlifced by Hi Department of Pre
ventive Medioine, University of
. iHiuourl, Columbia, Mo.
Measles is perhaps the most
widespread ef epldemio diseases
known, It Is perhaps the most
readily,, oommunioatable of all
diseases. It is present more or
less all the time in cities in the
Temperate Zone. Epidemios are
likely to ooour during the cool
months' of the year. . '
Experiment has proved that
the germ is contained la the blood,
and also in the secretions of the
nose and mouth. It Is most con
tagious before the eruption comes
out. The germ disappears from
the blood soon after the eruption
appear. 4 All persensare liable
to measles, but as it is so wide
spread the great majority of peo
ple oontraot it during childhood,
consequently it is usually consid
ered a childhood disease. Adults
have it muoh less frsqusntly than
children, but this is beoause they
have already had it.
The popular idea is that it is a
trivial disease and should not be
countenanced. It is often fatal
both in adults and in children,
pneumonia being the usual cause
of death. It is particularly fatal
in so-called sorofulous children,
and ibis not unoommon for, tuber
culosis to develop in ohlldren who
have teoovered (rom measles.
When tt becomes prevalent in a
new population the death rate is
high. For example, in the Sand
wich Islands, out of 150,000 pop
ulation, 40,000 died in (our
months time.
Since, the virus is contained in
the secretions of the nose and
mouth, it is evident that.in faction
usually takes place through these
seoretions. It probably enters
the body also through the nose
and mouth. Of all contagious
diseases known, measles is one
which apparently travels through
the air. Nevertheless, at the
Pasteur Hospital in Paris where
eaoh patient is in a separate al
cove opening into a common hall
without any physioial barrier
whatever, no oaee of measles is
spread (rom one patient to anoth
er, consequently we are sure that
contagion takes plaoe by direct
oontaot. In a great majority of
cases. It seems oertain that the
spray produoed by ooughing and
snsezing also oarriss the infeo
tion.
The prevention of measles is
ons of the most diffioult problems
which (ace the health officer, ao
a! cording to Dr. M. P. Ravehel of
the uepanmeni or - rrevenuve
Medicine of the University of
Missouri at Columbia. ' The di
sense is moat contagious in the
early stages before a diagnosis is
made, consequently the harm is
already done. The early symp
toms are very muoh like those of
an ordinary cold, consequently
they attraot little attention, and
other oases are so extremely mild
that the diagnosis is impossible
until the eruption appears.Never-
theiess, such oases can give a vi
rulent type of the disease to other
persons. , The common habit of
exposing children to measles so
that they oan have them while
they are young is entirely wrong.
Of the deaths whioh ooour nearly
90 per cent are in children under
5 years of age. Isolation of the
siok is the one measure which is
efficient for preventing the spread
of the, disease.
"Visiting should not be allowed,
but it should be remembered that
"no amount of isolation after the
disease isreoognised oan atone
(or the harm done before the
diagnosis Is made." Disinfec
tion of the room after a case' of
measles does not seem to be
worth while. It is best, however,
to leave a room in whioh measles
has ocourred empty and have it
well sunned and aired before re-
oooupying. Bedding, towels,
handkerohlefs, etc, should be
boiled.
Medioal Inspection and isola
tion of all pupils showing a rise
in temperature does muoh to pre
vent the spread of the disease
among sohool ohlldren, but with
all of our precaution measles con
tinues to be the most diffioult of
all diseasee to handle as far as
prevention goes.
Blackleg Vaccine Free.
An ounoe of prevention is
worth a pound of oure in dealing
with blaokleg as with many other
diseases. The germ which causes
it lives in the soil and it there is
reason to believe that the farm is
infected the farmer should secure
the free vaooine supplied by the
United States Department of Ag
riculture through the Missouri
Agricultural Experiment Station
at Columbia. Full instructions
for vaooinatlon are supplied with
the vaooine, whioh if properly
administered is very efteotive in
preventing the disease. It is suc
cessfully used by oattle raisers
all over this oountry and Europe
whereever there ie reason to be
lieve that blaokleg is likely to oo
our. ;
It is entirely unnecessary to
vaooinate healthy animals on a
farm whioh there is no reason to
believe to be infected. , This
would mean aloes of time and
valuable material which should
not be waated even though tup
plied free of charge.'' " 1
