ladies of Cresco and surrounding territory that ^e have decided to
carry a full line of Printzess Suits along with our line of Coats.
To the manv wearers of Printzess Coats this announcement will, of course,
mean more than to those who have not, as yet, become acquainted with
Printzess Styles and with all that the word Printzess implies when speaking
of Suits and Coats.
You will find the §ame degree of care taken in the expert tailoring of their
Suits as of their Coats, the same expert designing in the style, the same
graceful lines to the finished garment and the same beautiful and durable
linings are put into the Suit Coat as in the separate Coat.
Never has there been such a large variety of cloths shown from which to
select your New Spring Coat and Suit as this spring. For with the silk and
wool poplin, the gaberdines, the serges, the mixtures and checks, and the
beautiful new flannel cloths, every one should find the material and color to
their liking
We have our full line of Suits and Coats on the racks in our garment de
partment ready for your inspection, and we sincerely hope to have the
pleasure of entertaining you with an early try-on of these garments.
