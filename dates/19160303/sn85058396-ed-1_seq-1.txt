-,? Washington, March 3. "We are ap-
pronching the Issue of peace or war,"
declared Senator Sherman, Republl-
$ can, who voted against tabling the res-
1 olutlons. "Ultimately the way the
f chief executive is traveling leads hut
? to one close. It will end in war, or
fi national abandonment and humilia-
i tlou. There is no escape from the

I fiction of this senate today may be
parliamentary. It may be justified
I by the exigencies of the situation;
i but it smacks so strongly of cowar-
a dice, evasion and shirking of respon-
i sibility that I am justified in apply-
f ing to it these critical words."
Jl Senator Lewis Defends.
Senator Lewis, defending the action
) of the majority, said war with Spain
t might have been averted had similar
1 action been taken by congress In
I 1S9S.
"Had house resolutions seeking to
i intrench on the privileges of and du-
ties of the chief magistrate been
j treated as this one today, there would
? have been no conflict with Spain," he
' said.
"The unnecessary, vituperative,

was In favor, after full debate, of hav-
Ing congress go on record as support
s' ing the right of Americans to go on
3 board merchantmen, a right recog
j nfeeil for 500 years and to tell the
t world that any nation which did not
recognize that right would be held to
I a strict accountability.
Denounces Senate's Act.
"We denounce Germany because we
do not like her system of government
nor her militarism," said Senator
Eorah. "Yet the senate of the Unit
ed States, the highest legislative body
in the world, was Germanized today.
Wo took the same attitude and
reached the same result by the same
process as the highest German legisla
tive body would, if directed by the
IWk kaiser from the throne.

I . Vote of No Value.
Senator Borah continued that the

"It Is most unfortunate that we
' disposed of it as we did," he said.
' "I air. not afraid of war if it is ncceb-

Gallinger Desires Debate.
Senator Gallinger, Republican, ex
plaining his vote not to table the
Gore resolution, said:
"I think we arc entitled to debate
this question In the open. By our ac
tion today we have reached no con
clusions. I am in favor of doing all
wo can to prevent war and I think it
wise to advise against Americana
traveling on armed Bhlps."
Lodge Defends Senate.
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts de
clared that the senate's attitude could
not be confused because of the parlia
mentary entanglement
"In tabling the McCumber resolu
tion along with the others," Senator
Lodge said, "tho senate went on rec
ord as opposing a direct warning to
Americans and against any interfer
ence with executive authority. The
McCumber resolution slightly modi
fied, is in order but It will go to the
calendar and there will be no effort
made to pass It."
After the senate voted, house ad
ministration leaders directed their
efforts toward, obtaining a recommen
dation from the foreign affairs com
mittee that the McLemore resolution
be laid on the table. This would ad
mit of only forty minutes debate on
the floor. ,

WILSON REVEALS
U. S. SITUATION
Tells How Action of Bryan
and of Congress Has Weak
ened United States'
Position.
Washington. March 3. President
Wilson's position on the international
situation, as revealed further today,
was that he had told congressional
leaders that It was months after tho
resignation of former Secretary Bryan
before-the' 'UnltcaStules' government,
could convince Germany that this na
tion was in earnest in its position on
submarine warfare.
The president is understood to have
mentioned this fact to show his be
lief that action by congress would
further weaken the position of the
United States abroad. Ho is under
stood to have told the leaderB that
charges that he wanted to get the
United States into war were entirely
disproved by his attitude during the
last two years. He endured jeers and
ridicule, he said, because of his ef
forts to maintain peace. Tie is un
derstood to have declared that he has
always been willing to do anything,
except sacrifice honor, in order to
maintain the United States at peace.
At the same time the president de
clared he did not see how the United
States could do anything but sever
diplomatic relations with any nation
which killed Americans in violation
of international law.
While both Secretary Lansing and
Count von Bernstorff, the German am
bassador, have flntly declined to com
ment upon the statements regarding
the possibility of war attributed to
President Wilson by Senator Gore
and later denied by the White House,
it was learned today that mention of
the result of a break of diplomatic
relations had been discussed casually
and informally by the secretary and
ambassador late in January of this
year.
According t,o the authoritative In
formation, the discussion came at a
time when Secretary Lansing inform
ed the ambassador exactly what kind
of a communication from Germany
would settle the Lusitania case in a
manner satisfactory to the United
States. The ambassador is said to
have informed Mr Lansing that he be
lieved his government might change
some of the expressions used In the
document which the secretary had In
dicated would be acceptable. They
agreed that the ambassador should
submit the document to his govern
ment and see what changes it would
suggest, which the ambassador did
Bernstorff Asks Plain Question.
At the same time, quite Informally,
he is understood to have asked the
sccretnry what he thought would be
the ultimate result should Germany
fall to meet the requirements of the
United States.
Secretary Lansing, It is said, told
the ambassador that In event of a
complete disagreement on tho subject,
the United States might be obliged to
break off diplomatic relations. The
ambassador Is reliably represented as
having replied that he fully under
stood the view of the secretary and
to have added the hope that uothiug
of the kind ever would occur.
Germany Regards U. S. Wishes.
The ambassador pointed out that
with diplomatic relations severed
there would be no agencj by which
the enthusiasm of naval commanders
could be held in check and that some
circumstance was almost certain to
occur to lead to hostilities. The am
bassador also is reported as having
pointed out that the uiodlflcatlona in
the conduct of submarine warfare,
made since the beginning of the war,
has been solely on account of regard
for the wlshoa of the United States.
The authority, from whom this in
formation was obtained, said it should
be understood that tho ambaBBador
wns only expressing his own personal
opinions and that the conversation
with Secretary Lansing was absolutely
'nformal and not to be regarded as
significant of anything.
GORE RESOLUTION
TABLED 68 TO ! 4
Administration Victory in Sen
ate Greater Than Expected
Fight Transferred to
the House.
ALL PROPOSALS BEATEN
Congressmen to Consider
Armed Ship Question, Un
der Unanimous Consent,
Tomorrow at Noon.
Washington, March 3 By a vote
of 68 to 14, a greater majority than
they expected, administration forces
in the senate today tabled Senator
Gore's resolution to warn Americans
off tho armed ships of the European
belligerents and thereby finally quel
led in the senate an agitation which
. has embarrassed President Wilson In
the submarine negotiations with Ger
many. Senator Gore's resolution, a substi
tute by Senator McCumber, a Repub
lican, and an attempt by Senator Gore
to strengthen hiB original proposal,
all were defeated at one time on a
roll call on a motion by Senator
James, one of the administration
whips, to table them. The adminis
tration victory in the senate trans
ferred the fight to the house.
Senator Gore himself voted to table
his resolution. Senators Chamberlain
and O'Gorman were the only Demo
crats who voted against the admin
istration. The other twolve anti-administration
votes were Republican.
Forty-four Democrats and twentj'-two
Republicans voted to table the resolu
tion. Smoot Falls to Vote.
During the roll call Senator Smoot,
Republican, asked to be excused from
voting because he was not able to
vote direct on the proposition. Sen
ator Borah, Republican, objected but
tho senate voted to excuse him.
When Senator Stone's name was
called, he arose to explain that Sen
ator Saulsbury. Democrat, was absent
on account of Illness. He said that
If present, Senator Saulsbury would
have voted on the original resolution.
"I demand the regular order," de
manded Senator Borah.
In the confusion. Senator Borah mis
understood Senator Stone when he
added "very well, on thlB resolution."
"If this senate is going to be gagged,
the senntor from Missouri will be
gagged with the rest of us," Senator
Borah shouted.
When order was restored, Senator
Stone explained that "on this resolu
tion I vote aye."
There was some uncertainty among
senators as to the status of tho var
ious resolutions when tho roll call
had been begun.
It was explained then that Senator
James had moved not only to lay the
Gore resolution, but also the so-called
corrected resolution on tho table. It
was necessary then for senators to
express themselves as to warning and
on the question of killing of an Amer
ican on an unarmed merchantmen!
as a cause for war, in one vote.
For that reason Senator Gore voted
to table because he did not favor his
own substituto and had Introduced it
merely to get an expression of the
senate on that issue.
It was said at the White House
that the result In the senate was sat
isfactory and met the wishes of Presi
dent Wilson. It was added that atten
tion would now be concentrated on
the situation In the houso.

Text of Gore Amendment.
The text of Senator Gore's addition
to his original resolution and which
was table with the warning was as
follows:
"Resolved, by the senate, the house
of lepresentatives concurring, that
thG sinking by a German submarine
without notico or warning of an arm
ed merchant vessel of her public en
emy, resulting in tho death of a citi
zen of ihe United States, would con
stitute a just and sufficient cause of
war between the United Statos and
the German empire."
Several senators explained that the
double form of the question was re
sponsible for the character of the
vote as few senators wanted to vote
on the question regarding a cause for
war.
Immediately after the vote in the
senate, Senator Reed, Democrat, road
a statement saying he felt It was
highly important that tho Impression
in Germany that the country and con
gress was not behind the president
should be removed and that, there
fore, he was opposed to the Gore reso
lution. House Leaders Working.
While the senate was voting, house
leaders were working. There was no
doubt that the administration victory
In the senate was expected to solidi
fy the sentiment in the house and
the leaders looked for some favorable
developments during the day.
President Wilson after he had con
ferred wfIth Acting Chairman Pou of
the rule's committee determined to
have a vote in tho house oven if a
special rule containing a resolution
were required to get it.
Insistence that a vote be taken by
rules committee action If necessary
came after the varying reports as to
the stand of the foreign affairs com
mittee. As yet no resolution has been
agreed upon in the latter committee
which would command a majority
vote and there wns no positive as
surance today that any resolution
would be reported by it Chairman
Flood expressed the hope that a satis
factory resolution would be drawn to
day and reported when the commit
tee meets this afternoon.
Mr. Pou told members of the rules
committee that he regarded the pres
ent situation above partisan politics
and for that reason there would be
no secret sessions of tho Democratic
members to arrive at some plan of ac
tion. He wants a non-partisan vote.
Reed Assails Senate Discussion.
In connection with his statement in
the sonate, Senator Reed assailed the
sensational discussion in the senate
yesterday.
"I believe the effect of those utter
ances yesterday are to assort that In
thlc nation are those considering the
Interests of Germany rather than of
the United States," he said. "There
has been much talk of traitors. I
believe It would be difficult to find
in the whole United States one thou
sand men who would not assert the
highest degree of loyalty to the coun
try." Senator Jones,' Republican, declared
tho debating of the resolutions had
further fogged rather than clarified
any issue.
"Nothing has been decided today,
except that the senate, of the United
Stntcs can be gagged absolutely," he
said. "We have not passed on the
issue. We have only done like the
optrich and in tho face of danger
have covered our heads in the sand.
I voted against the resolution on gen
eral principles. A motion to table is
always made either to cut off debate
or to avoid an Issue.
"Have we complied with the re
quest of the president What did he
say to Representative Pou? That he
felt justified in asking permission to
urge an early vote on the resolution
in order to give an opportunity for
full public discussion and this is the
full public discussion we have."
"Perhaps the senator from Wash
ington is not in touch with the sub
terannean passageway to the White
House," suggested Senator Borah.
"It is easy to introduce another
resolution," continued Senator Jones.
" The senate has not settled the mat
ter yet. The president has not been
advised of the sentiment of the sen
ate en this proposition and the peo
ple of this country and the nations
abroad know It."
Text of Gore Resolution.
Washington, March 3. The text of
the Gore resolution follows:
"Whereas, a number of leading
powers of the world are now engaged
in a war of unexampled proportions;
and
"Whereas, the United States Is hap
pily at peace with all of the bellig
erent nations; and
"Whereas, it Is equally the desire
and the Interest of the American peo
ple to remain at peace with all na
tions; and.
"Whereas, the president has recent
lv afforded fresh and signal proofs
of the superiority of diplomacy to
butchery as a method of settling in
ternational disputes; aud
"Whereas., the right of American
citizens to travel on unarmed bellig
erent vessels has recently received
renewed guarantees of respect and
inviolability; and
"Whereas, the right of American
citizens to travel on armed belligerent
vessels rather than upon unarmed
vessels is essential neither to their
life, liberty or safety nor to the In
dependence, dignity or 'security oC
the United States, and
"Whereas, congress alone has been
vested with the power to declare war,
which Involves the obligations to' pre
vent war by all proper means consist
ent with the honor and vital Interest
of the nation: therefore be it.
"Resolved by tho senate, the house
of lepresentatives concurring, that It
is the sense of the congress, vested
as it is with the sole power to de
clare war, that all persons owing al
legiance to the United States should
in behalf of their own safoty and tho
vital interest of the United States for
bear to exercise the right to travel
as passengers upon any armed vessel
of any belligerent power, whether
such vessel be armpd for offensive or
defensive purposes, and it Is tho fur
ther senso of tho congresB that no
passport should be iBsued or renewed
by the secretary of stato, or by any
one acting under him, to he used by
any person owing allegiance to the
United States for purpose of travel
upon such armed vessel of a bellig
erent power." t

bardments and attacks on the part of
German troops continued all yester
day evening in the region to the nortb
of Verdun, according to announce
ment made by the French war office
this afternoon.
This fighting was conducted with
redoubled violence.
Near Douaumont several fruitless
endeavors on the part of the Germans
were repulsed with cruel losses for
them. Nevertheless, the Germans suc
ceeded in reaching the village of Dou
aumont where the fighting continues
with ferocity.
Germans Forced to Retire.
The village of Vaux also was attack
ed by the Germans but these advances
were checked by the French fire and
tho Germans were compelled to retire,
leaving a great number of dead.
The bombardment continued with
great intensity yesterday evening and
last night in the Woevre district, but
French forces held the Germans in
check by their curtain of tire.
The artillery of the Germans has
been active in the vicinity of Malan
court and near HaucourL
Continue Violent Bombarding.
The text of the statement follows:
"North of Verdun the bombardment
and the attacks of the enemy were
continued all last evening with re
doubled violence. In the sector of the
village of Douaumont, after several
fruitless efforts which were repulsed
with cruel losses on their part, the
Germans were successful in penetrat
ing to the village of Douaumont,
where the fighting Is continuing with
ferocity. Further east, the village of
Vaux was attacked at about the same
hour. Assaults, coming from the
north and the northeast, were broken
by our curtain of fire and by the ac
tivity of our machine guns. The en
emy was compelled to retire, leaving
among our barbed wire entanglements
a large number of dead bodies.
"In the Woevre district yesterday
evening and last night the bombard
ment continued with great intensity.
Checked, however, by our curtain of
fire, the enemy found It impossible to
come ouL &
"West of the river Meuse in the
regions of Malancourt and of Hau
court the artillery of the enemy has
been active.
"In Lorraine, south of the forest of
Parroy, a feeble attack was dispersed
by our Infantry and the use of hand
grenades."
Germans Claim Advances.
Berlin, March 3, via London. 3:40
p. iu. German troops cleared the vil
lage of Douaumont and pushed their
lines to the west and to the south of
the village and of the armored fort
yesterday, according to the official
announcement issued today by the
German army headquarters staff.
The official statement relates that
German airmen dropped bombs in the
vicinity of the main Verdun fort and
that to the east of Douai, Lieutenant
Immelman shot down a British bi
plane. The statement.adds that more than
1000 prisoners wero taken and also
that a number of heavy guns were
captured.
The statement follows:
"Western front: Southeast of Yp
res on the canal, the British broke In
to the positions taken from them on
the 14th of February and even pene
trated over a small front Into which
was our forward trenches. They wero
Immediately driven out of these but
still occupy somo parts of tho bas
tion. "South of the canal at LaBassee
lively fighting developed at close quar
ters before our front in conjunction
with onemy mine explosions.
Heavy Fighting In Champagne.
"In tho Champagne the activity of
the enemy's artillery increased in pla
ces until it became hoavy. In Bolante
wood, northeast of La Chalade, in the
Argonne, a tentative attack by the
French was repulsed easily.
"On tho heights east of the Meuse,
after heavy artillery preparations, we
cleared tho village of Douaumont of
the enemy and pushed our line out to
tho west and. south of tho village, as
well as of tho armored fort, to more
favorable positions. More than 1.000
prisoners and some hoavy guns were
brought in.
"Our, airmen dropped bombs in tho
vicinity of Fort Verdun. On the east
of Douai, Lieutenant Immelmann shot
down his ninth onemy aeroplane, a
British biplane. Of its two occupants,
one was killed and the other serious-
ly wounded. H
"Eastern theater: On the Dvlna M
east of Frlederichstadt there were ar- H
tillory engagements and also on the !
Sereth." H
Review of War Situation. j
So far as both official and, unoffi- M
cial accounts show, the situation H
around the French fortress of Ver- H
dun has not been changed by the re- H
cent fighting. The renewal 'of the M
German attacks both north and 'east M
has failed to shake the new French H
lines, while the Germans are holding H
as tenaciously to their advanced posl- H
tions la the face of such counter at- H
tacks as the French havo launched. H
Apparently the Germans now have M
been able to bring up some, at least, H
of their heavier artillery for the H
French war office has reported a con- H
slderable increase of tho intensity of M
the fire along the wliolo front at Ver- M
Tho drives on Verdun -from two j
sideB, now renewed, are held to indi- M
cale the familiar German plan of roll- 7 M
Ing up the flanks of a position, or j
using the claw hammer jaws of the M
military machine to get at the kernel M
of the nut. H
Movements In the Argonne. il
Possible development of some Ger- 'H
man movement in the Argonne north- jH
west of the fortress is indicated by jM
the Paris report that the French have il
directed a concentrated fire on hostile
positions thero. H
German military writers are laying jl
stress on the large amount of terrl- 'JM
tory wrested from the French in the l
