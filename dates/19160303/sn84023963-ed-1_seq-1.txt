A Sure Investment.
You have never yet 'made an investment
Where you didn't expect to win,
But. you sometime have found to your sorrow
You've beautifully taken in.
You may have laid down your good money
For a brick which you found wasn't gold,
Or met the Bohemian oats swindler,
When you, with your oats, have been sold.
If asked by a friend to play poker,
"You'd experience, no doubt quite a shock;
Then never join hands with a fellow
Who makes money by watering stock.
Now if you would like an investment
In which you can't possibly lose, '
Supose a fewjdollars in one of Ed. M. Egg Fine
Tailored Suits." Cor. 5th and Jackson Street
