HORRIBLE DEATH
FRONUABIES
Bitten by Unsuspected Dog, Suc?
cumbs to Disease, Which Did
Not Show Itself in Boy Un?
til Seven Weeks After.
Richmond, Va., March 1.?Rabies
has begun to claim its toll of tiumun
life in Virginia und that which the
.State Board of Health has been dread?
ing has happened. Patients are now
under treatment in tho State's lab?
oratory who havo been bitten, not by
a rabid dog, but by a rubid boy who
expired in the throes of the disease
a few days ago in a Southside county.
Accordin gto thc story told the
officer of thc board, the victim was a
negro boy of ten years who was bit?
ten in the lip one afternoon during
the first week in January by u dog
belonging to the family. The bite
was treated at the time and no furth?
er thought was given it. The next
ilay, when the dog was carried hunt?
ing with a pack he kept snapping at
the other animals and was finally
killed for this but even then rabies
was not suspected.
Tho wound on the child's lip healed
pjickly and no trouble developed un?
til Februnry 18. On that day thc
soy had temperature and was uneasy
and restless but showed no evidence
of localized pain. The following
morning, Sunday, the boy complained
of severe discomfort in thc throat
and had a number of convulsions.
Physicians were called in and a con
uiltntion was hold. Thc diagnosis was
rabies. From that time until his
leath the boy suffered from unmis
akable signs of madness and would
map and bite at those around him.
The face of the boy's grandmother
,vns bitten and bruised but the skin
,vas not broken. The boy's sister,
lowever, was bitten on the forearm
luring one of his convulsions and had
o be brought to Richmond for anti- ,
?abi treatment.
Tho arrival of this case at the lab?
oratory increases to seventeen the
lumber of rural communities in Vir?
ginia from which rabies has been re
loi-tcd since the first of the year and
aises to foryt the number of patients
vho have been under treatment dur
ng the same period.
"Unless dogs are muzzled or kept
ied where there is even the faintest
iiispicion of rabies, the Stale may
xpect other fatalities mmialr to this
listressing one," declares thc board
RGINIA, FRIDAY, MARCH 3,
in its announcement. "There ore ev
idcnces of nn unusual preavalence oi
rabies in this country at present am
Virginia is by no menus immune. Ii
California, Kansas, Idaho, and No
vada, the disease has become so wide
spread that the federal authorities
have been cnllcd upon for assistance
"It is a short-sigthed policy tc
reconcile ourselves to the spread ol
rabies merely because wo have a sat?
isfactory preventive. The anti-rab
treatment is wonderfully effective
und in more than 400 cases treated
by the State during the last few
years no ill effects have been oted
llut there is always danger, as in the
case discussed above, that the disease
will not be recognized and that dentil
mny result. Even where Ibis does not
occur, a long rbsence from home is
necessary for treatment and ihucti
vnluublc stock may have to be kill?
ed. Most outbreaks of rabies begin
with stray dogs.1'

Mr. Hampton reports good busi?

Wednesdy, Thursday, Friday
March Eighth, Ninth and Tenth
We are, al! of us, justly proud of this new Millinery. Not only are the stock assort?
ments much larger and more varied than ever before, but we've more line French Pat?
terns, more French Flowers and other trimmings. And, too, we've a large assortment of
leaders, that is, Hats that will be sold at low popular prices that arc worth much more.
You are going to be just as enthusiastic ns we are, for the Hats are so beautiful, so
artistic, so becoming that you cannot lie otherwise. The hats alone are more than worth
a trip to Bluefield, but there is much more on display for you.
SUITS COATS
THE YOUTHFUL SILHOUETTE, WITH WING-LIKE FLAUE, IS THE CORRECT
SPRING VOGUE.
Our tailored suits and coats portray these new spring tendencies most faithfully.
They do more; they embody these attractive features in garments skillfully designed
and made to be most becoming, to fit well, and to give the utmost pleasurable service.
Only pure wool and pure silk fabrics enter into the making of these garments, in spite
of the scarcity of unadulterated fabrics.
DRESSES
Spring and summer fashions are most clearly portrayed in these dresses. You know
already that spring fashions are to be very difFerent?but until you see these you can?
not realize how distinctively new and charming they really arc.
New Silks, Woolens, Cotton and Linen Fabrics
Much of this stock, when re-ordered, will be considerably higher and many shades will
be difficult to find later in the season, but now the prices are very reasonable and much
of it, due to early purchases, is at old prices. Take our advice and buy now.
The New Petticoats Are Beautiful
And best of all, are no higher. We contracted for them six months ago before the silk
advance. This store never advances prices until forced to, and our long experience in
buying guides us. We know when to place early orders.

AGAINST BUCHANAN.
The suit of Gillospio and Stcelo
against M. G. Buchanan was compro?
mised on Monday, Huchanan paying
\the shortage claimed of about $1,000.
The history and facts of the case
as we get it are about as follows:
Buchanan was in charge of the gen?
eral store of Gillctpio and Steele at
Laurel, in this county, on a commis?
sion basis of 10 per cent of the profits
of the business. When the business
,was closed, or an inventory taken
it. was claimed that there were no
"profits" and that the losses were
inbout $1600. A check for $00. drawn
by Huchanan in his own favor was
,i.ot charged up on the books, and upon
.his discovery a charge of emhezzle
vlient was made and he was- indicted
foy the grand jury.
liuchuiu.n says that his failure to
charge the check to himself was a
clear oversight, and ho had no inten?
tion whutovor of embezzlement.
When the case was called here on
Monday tho charge of embezzlement
of tho $60 check wan dropped, and a
compromise entered into by counsel
that Huchanan should pay the. amount
of the shortages, as claimed by in?
ventory taken by Gillospio it Steele
to be about $1(>00.
The lawyers engaged were Grcevor

through his paper, wondering if this
could possibly he a committtoe of
"investigation," Inquiry, protest or
what'.' Perhaps u collection for some
benevolent purpose, such as thu 011
downmont of u college, for instance.
The vidi tor was utterly at u loss
to know what was up, and awaited
developments. As stated, Dr. Hurley
seemed to have been designated as
thu leader and spokesman of the in?
vaders, llo called the editor to order
and staled Hint the committee bad
called to speak with thu editor, on "u
matter of business," in which wo nro
nil interested." Still no clue; Mr.
Hurley "yielded the lloor" to Itov. Mr.
W. C. Thompson, lie arose, and in a
few moments the editor saw a glim?
mer of light and the skies began to
clear. Mr. Thompson said, in sub?
stance:
Tile Clinch Valley News has proven
itself u friend to the preachers und
churches, Vou have published abroad
all our "poundings," i.ccounls of re?
vivals, etc., and a Blight token of our
nppruciiilioii wo desire to present you
Una chain, which, we hope, will bo ac?
ceptable, etc., and handed the editor
a box containing n nice, gold watch
chain. My this lime the editor's face
was aglow, but his lo..gud Hcomer to
have stuck lo the roof of bis mouth,
lie stammered u few feeble remarks
of thanks and appreciation, about us
follows: "Editors Kcnornlly got brick
bats instead of boquets, criticism in?
stead of praises. This hi u now ear in
my journalistic experience. This lit?
tle chain is too weak and short to
serve as manacles for the wrists, or
lo unite handcuffs, but. this act on
your part goes a long way toward
a complete "subsldatioil of the press,"
und (ho Clinch Valley News shall
feel it tin honor and a privilege here?
after as heretofore, to lend what in?
fluence mid help it can command to
help you in your great work. The
intrinsic value of the gift Is consid?
erable, but us nothing compared with
the value of (he motive and good will
which prompted it.. I thank you most
sincerely."

BOND ISSUM IN CLEAR PORK
mSTIUCT.
(Editorial.)
There seems little or no doubt nil to
the bond issue in Clear Kork district.
The amount asked for is trilling com?
pared with the effect of good roads,
particularly bolwcon Pociiliontas ami
Ta/ewell.
This paper gave vent lo a mild kick
on the .appropriation of $75,000 for u
certain road in that neighborhood, as
it seemed to us n little excessive, and
particularly us the mileage was not
given. The amount has been cut to
$05,000 mid the mileage given as
15 1-2 miles. The road is a diflicult
one, and the amount of $05,000 is not
excessive. Every ciHzon of thj Clear
Pork district should gel behind this
bond issue mid also in the other dis?
trict, und carry it through unani?
mously. This will be the lust bond is?
sue und the last chance for many
yonrs,
