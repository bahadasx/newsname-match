to the Kwtwn
A bonded elevator and a bonded
f wafchc-uao are two thlngr not only
badly needed, but absolutely nocea-
aary In Snyder.
The farmera of thla auction have
? BUHtalncd losses on grain to tbo ex
j tent of thousands of dollar! thla sea
f aou by reason of not having an ele
f vnlcr, and wo need an elovator of auf-
f flclent capacity to accommodate or
rather care for, the enormoua fain
' crop of thla section. Take the nialie,
kafflra corn and feterlla crops alone
and eatlmale, If you can the loaa farm
men have .sustained on account of
no elevator being here tnia aeaaon.
The farmer threabea hit (rain and
muat either aack It or atore It In
gtanarlea. Sacks coat- money and rata
proceed to gnaw holea In theao Micka,
resulting In great waale and Icaa. It
takea a very large and expenalve gran
ary to care for any conalderabe quan
tity of grain and grain atored In any
considerable quantity la nearly sure
to heat and ruin. In addition to the
rat peela and the heat damage, along
comet the Weovll. These troublea and
a greater part of the expense la elim
inated by the elevator.
In many respects the bonded ware
house law la one of the moat rovcilu
tlonary and constructive piecee of
legislation that hae ever been placed
on the atatiitoa of Texas. With
bonded elevator the farmera could
not only hold and handle their grain
crop to better advantage, but they
could put their own aaleamen In the
Held. Just the other day a gentleman
from the Plains, chanced to be- In
Dalngerfleld, In Morrla county. While
there three care of Plrflne malse were
unloaded and sold to farmera. Thla
waa malse In the head and the price
paid waa fit per ton. The malse waa
bought by the farmera from a local
doaler In Dalngerfleld. At that time
malse waa being Bold here at around
nine dollars per ton and the freight
from the point where this partlcualr
malse was bought to Dalngerfleld waa
13.10 per ton. Tlie Dalngerfleld far
mere weae puylng soven dollara por
ton more for malxe thun the Plains
farmera were gelling. Three dollara
and twenty centa per ton went to
the railroads and three dollars and
elgrtty conte to aperuntors and deal
er i. Most assuredly the farmera cc-uld
' afford- to put their own selling agent
In the Held with enormous saving lo
' themselves under conditions of Ihia
kind, and with a bonded elevator
company thla coutd easily be done.
' With an elovator grains of all kind
can be treated and proporly eared for.
No rata, no heating, no weevils, no
waate. And a greater advantage Is yel
to be considered. With a bended ele
vator receipt the farmer can go to the
bank and borrow liberally on his
C, grain. Oraln atoted In a granary,
put awa) In aarke or atandlng In the
' shorks In the neld la not collateral
and fhe farmer can borrow nothing
on It. The termor muat sell, regard
lesa of the market price or hold re
gardleee of cmeequencee In tbe mat
ter of rata, rot and weevils. The price
of malse always goea up late In the
aeaaon. The farmer that can hold hla
atuff Is nearly certain to get a good
price. Tbe farmer that muat aell must
aacrlflce and few farmera can af
ford to hold when they can not prop
erly oare for their atuff nor borrow
money on It.
A bonded elevator means thou
sands of dolalra for the farmera of
. thla section, and that mesne thou
sands of dollara tor the farmera of
entire community.
Of equal Importance la a bonded
cotton warebouae. Indieattona point
to an enormoua cotton crop In Bcur-
rj county thla year. The aame holda
warding the entire cotton
owing portion of the United States.
Thla condition probably. In fact, near
ly certainly, meana low prices. In mat
event, farmers will want to oorrow
money on their cotton They will hrve
