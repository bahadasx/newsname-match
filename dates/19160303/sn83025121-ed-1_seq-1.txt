The fight between the chief executive

this question is attracting the atten

terest is being shown in Italy, Paris
and Loudon, and reports which have
reached the state department show the

ment announced last night that it had
received information from Berlin that
reports are being widely circulated in
the German rapitol that the President
Is losing in his stand a Congress is

added the state department statement,
serve to show how grossly misinformed

HER POETRY AND STORIES CHARMED A WORLD
(Associated Frsss by Federal WlrsloM.)
LONDON, March .1. Blinobeth,
Queen Mother of Rumania, better
known to the world nt large as "Car
men t'ylvia," died at Bucharest, her
sou 'm cupital, last night, according to
reports which reached this city.
The pen name "Carmen Sylva" by
which the Queen Mother Elizabeth was
most widely known, was chosen by her
in expression of her lore for song an 1
the woods. She was one,, of 'the most
churuiiug figures in the courts of Ku-
rope, and practically the only one of
, recent generations to gain fame as a
poetess.
I Iu her own words, she was born "far
from a throne," for although she was
a princess or Wieil, one or tne many
tiny principalities with which Germany
abounded, her youth wns that of an
ordinary robust country girl who learn
ed to cook and sew and who romped
iu the open with her companions at
the village school. Hlie was- born De
cember 29, 1843, ami iu her Childhood
she showed predilection for the! poetical
fancies that hnd su h uu influence on
her Inter life. She ulmorbed innumer
able fuiry stories and, with some of
her own imagination added, she de
lighted her playmates with her fancies.
At home she received Spartan training,
and with a father who was an invalid
for life, ami h brother who Was in
currably ill, she experienced many sor
rows aud hardships.
Mourns Death of Father
I'pon the death of her brother, the
Princess was . sunt awuy to visit her
aunt, tho Grand I'm. hens Helena of
RiiNsia, who took her traveling to van
oiih parts of Kurope. It was during
this tour, howcAcr, thut the Princess

ove.- to a representative of the British
Admiralty to Identify the raider. The raider Is evidently a commercial ship
and probably sailed from one of the. German porta, though how the managed

herself was stricken with typhus 'ever,
and when she recovered it was to luaru
that her father had passed away. She
waa deeply affected by the sorrow in
her family, and music and poetry be
came her only consolation. "Must all
I loe on earth be borne to the gravel"
is the burden of a mournful poem that
she wrote at tho tine of her father's
death.
Among her friends about her home
on t.ie Rhine, "the little wild rose-bad
of Wied " had evinced an almost sav
age difdike to matrimony, aud had often
excluiii' 'd: "I do sot want to marry
unless I can be Queen of Rumania."
The principality of Rumania had at that
time just been founded, and there was
no sense in the young Princess's remark
pxwept that she believed it a sufficiently
safe way to say that she didn't want
to marry at all.
Remarkable Royal Romance
There is a remarkable romance at
tached to the fact that some years
later her suitor became Prince -Charles
of llohcnzollcm; who was refused on
the nam" fanciful pretext that the
Princess would not marry unless she
could be Queen of Rumania. Iu 1MH8,
Prince Charles was chosen ruler of Ru
mania, and in the autumn of the next
year he returned to Wied to remind the
PKiiccsh Klixubeth of ber desire to rule
over thut Kingdom.
Marritil, ami settled in the palace at
Bucharest, the Princess threw herself
with urCat ardor into the life of tho
country. She learned to read and
write Rumanian, made herself ao
(,uuiiited with the needs and require
ments of the land, aud became so be

practically her whole life to philan

her literary talents in a limited way
for inuuy years, it was not until the
death of her first, knd only child, at
the age of four, that much of her work
was published.
Glimpse of Farorlto Theme
Though her poems lose much from
the translation, one gHmpt of a favor

"The fairest word oa ' earth that's

Is mother.-
To whom sin li name shall once belong,
High honor tiers Her wrple life long,
A mother.
But all her earthly joy ar o'er,
Who is and then who is no more

She translated into German the fa

that they have two thousand Teuton
soldiers, rut off and hopelersly surround

Douaumont. German attempts to re
lieve these men so far have failed ut
terly, proving decidedly costly to tho

for some time, and the infantry attack
have followed, but both guns and In.

Oerman Destroy Fort Vaux
Fort Vaux has been destroyed by the
fire of the German heavy guns, but the
Teutons are not able to take advantage '
of this fact owing to the. constant rain
of shells poured upon the piece by the
French artillery. The French also re
port the destruction of a battery of
German guns by their own six inch
rides.
Reports indicated last night that the
German commanders are concentrating
a force. of 90,000 men at the little town
of Uuzy, sixteen miles eaBt of Verdun.
This is believed to be the point of at

his generals.

she was held in great affection. As
to womnus work, Carmen Sylvia pfteu
expressed herself in interviews. " A,
woman," she said, "is made fur the
home. Her hands should be trained te

can do by her own fireside, and thero
her husband should find her."
Her husband, King Charles I. of Ru
mania, died in October, 1911, pust 73
years of age. Since - then the Queen
Mother herself had been in ill health,
suffering particularly from eataract iu
