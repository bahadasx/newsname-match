NEW TRIAL FOR
CHARLIE FliLKERSON
SLACK THINKS ARGUMENT OF
COMMONWEALTH'S ATTORNEY
PREJUDICIAL.
Near tho close of the recent term
of the Ohio Circuit Court' the motion
for new trial of Charlie Fulkerson
who was convicted at the special
August term of Court of voluntary
manslaughter and sentenced to a
term In the pcnetentlary for killing
Wesley Smith at Rockport In May
1909, was heard by Judge Slack. Tho
only grounds for new trial relied on
by the defendant of Commonwealth's
Attorney Ben D. Rlngo was prejudic
ial to the rights of the defendant,
and after brief consideration of the
argument, which, had, been reported
by tho official stenographer the Court
was of the opinion that tho defend
ant's complaint was well founded
and awarded him a new trial. The
particular portion of the argument of
which ihe defendant most strenlously
complained was that portion which
urged the jury to find the defendant
guilty lest he should be turned loose
and return to his former neighbor
hood where he was 'not wanted. The
defendant pleaded insanity as de
fense and it was in response to this
plea that tho argument referred lo
was mndo.
It was not urged that the evidence
heard on tho trial, which shows that
Smith was killed la a most burtal
mannor, was not sufficient to support
tho verdict of guilty, but that the
argument referred to was prejudicial
to tho rights of the defendant.
Tho ovldcnco produced by the
Commonwealth on the trial shows
that Fulkerson used a single barrel
shot-gun, and deliberately "shot
Smith first In tho back, then loaded
and shot him twico more, the last
time whllo his victim was prostrate
on tho ground. Tho evidence furth
er showed that Smith was at the home
of Fulkerson ostensibly for improper
relations with fulkerson's wife and
on being-apprehended1 by Fulkerson
there was some evidence that as he
ran away he put his hand In his pock
et as though to draw a weapon.
It 1b not known whether Fulkerson
will be put on trial again or not,
as It Js rumored that tho people who
were urging his prosecution have re
lented and now desire that he be per
mitted to go on his own roconlzance
pleading good behavior. The indict
ment was filed away soon after the
homicide qn such condition but was
reinstated last Juie when it was
made to appear that hi conduct was
not good.
NO COMPROMISE
SAYS CONGRESS MUST TAKE
RECORD VOTE AS TO WARN
ING AMERICANS.
NEGOTIATIONS HELP US
President Will Take No Further
'Steps In German Controversy on '
His Own Responsibility.
Washington, March 1. President
Wilson served notice on Congress to
night that he will consent to nothing
less than a record vote on the antt
Admlnlstratlon resolutions to warn
Americans off the armed ships of
European belligerents before he goes
on with the German submarine nego
tiations. No compromise' proposition, such
as a voto of confidence In the Presi
dent's foreign policy will be accept
able. Such an action, it is held,
might be construed in Berlin as jus
tifying tho opinion that the Presi
dent lacks tho' support of Congress
and his own party In, his demands for
a full observance of International
law, while Its only purpose would be
to afford members of Congress a way
to avoid recording their .positions be
fore tbe country on the straight out-and-out
question.
N President Wilson made his position
clear to Congressional leaders tonight
In unequivocal terms, as the climax
to' a day of confusion, uncertainty
and political maneuvering that mark-,
ed the opening of his first real fight
with Congress.
If It Is, to emphasize that, the Pres
ident absolutely refuses to continue
the negotiations with Germany Until
the attitude of Congress is settled, It
was made known that the United
States does not consider the latest as
surances from Count von" Bernstoi'ff,
tho German Ambassador, as broad
or as satisfactory as those originally
given. No further step will be tak
en, however, while the President
waits on Gongress. Meanwhile the
pending Lusltanla agreement wl not
bo finally accepted.
The whole situation in Congress,,
confused by the President's call for
a vote, was thrown Into a snarl to
day when at an early morning confer
ence tho President outlined his posi
tion to Chairman Stone and Flood,
of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Senate Leader Kern, Speaker Clark,
House Leader Kltchln. and Acting
Chairman Poii, ofthe House Rules.
Committee.
As soon as the delegation return
ed to the capital with1 news of what
the President had said, It Wy,attautomi and commerclai
ont that some of the leaders who had s ' . ..,.. . ." ..
secretly supported the antl-Admtnts-tratlon
forces, and under Adminis
tration pressure had' pocketed reso
lutions In committee when" there was
danger; of their being passedijrealld-'
ed that the President and his friends
had suddenly gained the whip
hand.
It was plain that they at once devot
ed their efforts to attempts to avoid
a defeat at the hands of the Admin
istration forces by sidetracking- the
main Issuo and making tho fight
turn to a voto on a resolution of con
fidence for tho President In which
thoy could Join without compromis
ing their position in support of -warn
ing Americans to avoid bclllgorent
armed ships.
Practically in control of tho ma
chinery ofc tho House" these leaders
hold; tho situation in deadlock all
day, whllo they conferred and sought
for some proposal which would sat
isfy the. President and still save their
positions.
