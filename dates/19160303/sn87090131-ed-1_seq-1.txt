HWA RO LEt IO AY
By JANE OSBORN.
To be the youngest male professor
in a girl's college would be trying
enough, but, added to that distinction,
to possess a pair of boyish blue eyes 3
and a snubbish sort of freckled nose
that just naturally made girls of the r
college age treat you like a younger
brother was a role that few men would
like to play. But Tom Newbury had
his reasons. It was not only because
the post of professor of mathematics
at Mendham was the first available t
m'ans of earning his living that pre
sented itself two years ago, when he
left his alma mater. The real reason,
although no one knew it but Tom, was
that Sally Phelps was about to enter
Mendham, and, although Tom hadn't
mentioned the fact to her, he rather
liked the idea of being near her.
It was a springlike day -in Febru
ary w'en Sally had been in college a
yea, I a half that Tom Newbury at
last uccided that he could wait no s
longer to make his declaration. Sec- I
ond semester had begun, and he had
decided never to begin another. In
fact, he had accepted a position as
mining engineer and had decided to
persuade Sally to leave school with f
him In May.
He had decided to make his long- I
deferred declaration down the lane
that leads from the campus toward
the woods at Mendham. The dormi
tory reception room is so frightfully
uncompromising, so unsympathetic to
ward such an adventure. Even on a
cold day, the lane toward the woods '
was a warmer spot.
But planning was one thing and
getting Sally to stroll down the lane i
was quite another.
"Really I'm dreadfully sorry," she told
him, looking out of brown eyes that
were as frank and honest as his own,
yes, too, that looked at Tom almost
on a level, for Sally was every inch
as tall as the youngest professor.
"kou see, tonight's the night of the
sophomore banquet-down in the boat
house across the lake. We have had
tires laid in the fireplaces and the ca
terer is going to manage somehow.
You see, we had to have it some place
that the freshmen would not suspect.
Don't breathe a word of it."
There was no use asking Sally to
see him after the banquet, or to give
him time before, for Sally was class
president and there would be no room
in her busy evening for thoughts of
aught besides class matters. And be
fore Tom could speak of a possible
stroll down the lane the following
evening she was off on the pretext
of having to spend the afternoon work
ing over the speech she had to make
that night
It was in no very cheerful frame of
mind that the youngest professor
strolled down through the campus be
fore going to his boarding house for
dinner that evening. What if Sally
wouldn't accept him after all? Had
he been wasting those two years when
he might have been working at a
man's Job in the man's world instead
of cloistered away in a woman's col
lege?
He walked slowly down to the exact
spot in the lane that he had chosen
in his earlier plans for asking Sally.
He leaned over the footbridge that
spanned the little stream and took in
long breaths of the crisp, bracing
February air, in which there was ever
so slight a hint of approaching spring.
The setting sun sent long shafts of
red-golden light through the mass of
tangled brush that bordered the lit
tle stream below.
Then in the recently-melted waters
of that very stream he saw Sally's
reflection, even before he realized that
she was standing at his side.
He turned and would have spoken
when Sally clapped her hand abruptly
over his mouth.
"Quick!' she whispered. "Hide me!
They'll see us. Here, down under the
bridge in the brambles. They will
never think of looking there.'
And before Tom had a chance to
ask for an explanation he and Sally
had secreted themselves under the
bridge on the woody growth of
branches and vines that grow at the
side of the stream.
"It's a little soggy here," Sally
whispered at length, seizing Tom's
hand to keep from slipping on the
thawing ground. "But I think I am
safe. They won't think of looking
here, will they?"
"Who won't?" asked Tom, clutching
the brambles in an effort to keep his
footing.
"The freshmen. You see, we tried
to keep i. a secret about that banquet,
but it leaked out and now they are
trying to kidnap me. The idea you
know is always to get the class pres
idents on banquet nights. WVell, I
started out and I thought I'd get
around to the boathouse all right if I
went this way. I put on Peggy
Adams coat. You know what a giant
she is. I'm tripping on the coat now.
But they must have found out that I
got her things because just when I
got this far I heard them calling. I
heard one of them say:
"' "She's making for the little lane.
Bind her hand and foot and tie the
bag over her head.' You know, they
aren't very careful what they do to
class presidents on banquet nights.
I'm perfectly safe here, of course, only
I've got to get to the banquet."
It may have been highly inoppor
tune, but with Tom there was no time
like the one planned for the deed.
Why tempt Providence by not propos
uing to Sally on the spot?
Sally answered his appeal not quite
as sedately as Tom had expected.
In tfct she actually lauhed. "If that
isn't like a man. .You have kept me
guessing for months. I was just crazy
to know whether you really and truly
liked me a little, but you wouldn't
give me an inkling, and now when ei
ther of us may slip down in the mud
any minute, down here under the
bridge and the brambles, with me all
smothered up in Peggy Adams' coat,
you ask me. But you know I care.
Ask me again tomorrow night. I've
really got to get to that banquet now.
Tom, if you really love me show it
now. You give me your coat and hat
and I'll fool them. It's getting dark.
They'll never know. You're an angel.
You must wait here a little while so
they won't think it is funny that there
are two of us if they are still watch
ing. You know it would mortify me to
death if those snippy freshmen really
got me."
In a second, Tom, shorn of his coat
and hat, was watching from his re
treat the departing figure of Sally, who
was taking long strides and strutting
off in apparent imitation of his gait
lie waited patiently for five min
utes. The darkness was settling and
a cold wind was springing up. He
looked down at the bundled coat and
hat that belonged to Sally's Amazoni
an roommate.
"It may be 9 queer fit,' he said, "but
I'm not going to caten pneumonia for
anyone." And with that he pulled on
Peggy Adams' spacious coat and
pulled her sport hat down over his
head, and then, forgetful o' his strange
disguise, he strolled through the woods
in the direction that Saily had gone
Suddenly he heard footsteps behind
him and then a torrent of high pitched
voices. Then the younges' professor
suddenly felt himself borne down upon
by unseen hands from the rear and
in another minute he was struggling
against what seemed to be a bag that
was drawn over his head and was be
ing tied securely about his waist and
bound in gag-wise, at his moLth. Then
the youngest professor felt himself be.
ing pushed by some dozen firm young
hands and arms into what apparently
was a bag of enormous proportions
"Now lift her into the wheelbarrow,
gently, 'cause we don't want to hurt
her." That was as much as Tom could
stand. It did not take muc. of an ef
fort to wriggle his way out of the gag
tied about his mouth, and with a few
more struggles his hands were free.
The outer bag seemed to be more se
curely tied. He could at least use his
voice and his fists. He pitched his
voice as low as possible and assumed
an air of deep importance.
"Young ladies, this is going too
far."
There was a chorus of mingled
screams pitched in as many keys as
there were freshmen and in a moment
more the youngest professor stood
forth in the semi-darkness. facing his
embarrassed captors He doffed his
borrowed cap and bowed low
"I suppose I an: a surprise to you.
You know, I suppose that hazing such
as you were attempting is strictly pen
alized by the faculty."
"lBut we didn't know it was you.
We thought it was Sally. How did
you get into Molly's coat and hat?"
a dozen voices asked.
"If I were to tell you young ladies,'
with a brave attempt at dignity, "that
this was all part of a faculty plot to
discover and bring to justice the ring
leaders in this hazing conspiracy, I
suppose you would have to admit that
we had been a little shrewder than
you." He watched with pleasure the
looks of dismay and consternation that
came over the faces of the freshmen.
Then he smiled with all the candor
of the self-importance of the professor
that he had been trying to be, as he
said:
"But that is not the case. I was
not scouting for the faculty when I
was caught, though I'm sure they'd
like to get a report of the encounter.
Now here's a fair bargain. I won't
report you if you won't report me.
Perhaps some day you will know why
I was strolling around in a sopho
more coat and hat. For the time be
ing the joke is on all of us."
And the youngest professor contin
ued ,his way to his boarding house'
coatless and hatless in spite of the
chill winds of February.

What Is Ugliness?
This question of ugliness is our
greatest difficulty in discussing post
impressionism. We may as well face
it immediately. If beauty were only
defined we could get along better. Cer
tain qualities, such as honesty, co
ordination, balance, workmanship
which unerringly hits the mark aimed
at, may be recognized as essential to
great art. But beyond these, beauty
is so much a matter of opinion as
merely to follow a fashion. Through
the past century, painter after painter
:as seemed to both public and critic
the very embodiment of ugliness.
Turner, Millet, Manet, Monet-all took
their turn. And thirty years ago
Cezanne first met the same charge.
If the pictures cf Cezanne, or any
ether innovatcr, have enough of spirit
ual cr sensuous content to hold man's
interest, we may be sure we shall end
by calling them beautiful in one or an
other of the many senses that criti
cism is forced to give the term. Those
who understand Cezanne find in him a
depth of insight, both technical and
spiritual, which they inevitably call
beauty.-H. M. Luquiens in the Janu
ary Yale Review.
Superabundant Fame.
"When a man does anything well
he ought tc get credit for it," re
marked the generous-minded man.
"Not always," replied Bronco Bob.
"Me an' Piute Pete got the reputation
of beln' such good poker players that
It completely spoiled bus1lss"
