THREE MURDERERS EXECUTED'
President Wins Victory!
SENATE
GIVES IN
Votes 63 to 14
to Table the
Resolution of
Sen. Gore
WASHINGTON, D. C, Mar;h
3.—Amid dramtic scenes unpar
alleled since the declaration of
war on Spain, the senate today
by a vote of 68 to 14, tabled the
Gore resolution warning Ameri
cans not to travel on armed ships.
The vote demonstrated that
congress stands behind the presi
dent in his negotiations with
Germany.
Gore himself voted to table his
resolutoln so that he might have
an opportunity to ask for a re
consideration.
The action of the senate, it Is
thought, will be sulficlent to kill
sentiment in the house against
Wilson's foreign policy.
The administration victory in
the senate today gave signs of
breaking up all other opposition.
Table Substitute.
Senator McCumbre ojiened he
fight today, offering a substitute
resolution declaring it the duty
of every American to abstain
from the right to travel on armed
ships until the submarine mut
ters are settled.
The resolution was tabled.
Senator James then demanded
a vote on the tabling of the Gore
resolution.
Gore Bprung a surprise by sub
mitting an amendment to his
resolution and asking permission
to discuss it.
Nearly an I liiniatmii.
The nniendment amounted to
an ultimatum to Germany. It
stated that the death of an Amer
ican through submarine .attack
would be deemed a canSe of war
and changed several voteß.
Senator Ashurst then demand
ed a roll call, which began at
11:40.
Those voting against tabling
the Gore resolution warning
Americans from armed merchant
men were: Borah, Chamberlain,
Clapp, Cummins, Fall, Gallinger,
Oronna, Jones, LaFollette, Mc-
Cumber, Norris Oforman Sherman
and Works.
House U> Follow Hull.
The senate thus clinched the
whole question In favor of tb*
administration.
Following similar action which
the house is expected ot take
quickly, the state department may
resume negotiations In the Lusi- I
inula case.

Peter has been nabbed by the

simply running on the wrong side

cil his version of stories circulat
ed this week to the effect that he

Parks says that he is the vic
tim of a plot to cause him to lose
his job. He says he approached
Hawthorne, whom he declares he
has admired for years, and of
fered to act as campaign mana
ger.
"I figured up that ihe ex
penses of a campaign, by which I
meant the printing, advertising
and general expense, would be
$1,.">00," says Parks.
"I told Mr. Hawthorne that 1
believed I could gain favor for
him in the eyes of a certain or
ganization to which l belong—
not the Patriotic Sons."
What Charter Hays.
Hawthorne told Mayor Fawcett
practically the same story, with
the exception that he declared
that Parks had turned against
