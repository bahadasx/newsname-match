throng, which included the president's
wife, fairly hummed with expectation.

THE WAR
TODAY
In the European war field the
armies of the German crown
prince, resuming their attacks on
the defenses of Verdun, have brok
en into the French lines at the
village of Donaumont, four miles
northeast of the fortress.
The official bulletin from Parle
today admits that the Germans
penetrated to the village, where
fighting was declared to be contin
uing with ferocity.
The Berlin statement claims
more than this, announcing that
German troops had not only clear
ed the French from Donaumont
Tillage but had advanced their
lines west and south of the village,
and of Fort Donaumont, just to the
east, recently captured by the Ger
mans. They took more than 1,000
prisoners and several heaTy guns.
The violent German offensive
on Verdun has been resumed, the
fighting taking on an extremely
desperate character north of the
French stronghold.
The Farls war office claims that
the French repulsed all the Ger
man attacks, except the west of
Fort Douaumont, the Germans
reaching1 the Tillage of Donamont
where the struggle is being con
tinued. The British have regained 800
yards of trenches taken from them
by the Germans Feb. 14 along the
Ypres-Comlnes canal. The Ger
man galleries were destroyed and
four officers and 176 men were
taken prisoners.
On the Enssian and Austro-Ital-lan
fronts no notable changes have
been reported for several days.
The .Russians are still maintain
ing a strong offensive against the
Turks fn Asia.
The British admiralty in mak
ing public instructions to com
manders of armed merchantmen
says: "Armament Is supplied
such Tessels solely for the pur
pose of resisting attack by an
armed vessel and must not be used
for any other purpose whatso-

ABANDON HOPES
FOR AGREEMENT
Miners and Operators Differ Over One
Cent in Negotiations of Middle
West Wage Scale.
New York, March 3. All hope of ne
gotiating an interstate wage agreement
for the soft coal fields of the middle
west was virtually abandoned today on
a difference of one cent, when propo
sitions offered by both operators and
miners were voted down by a sub
committee representing the two sides.
Some operators and miners expected
the sub-committee later in the day to,
report a disagreement to the full Joint
conference. In this event a sine die
adjournment of the conference will
likely result.
Today the miners lowered their ten
per cent increase demand for dead
work and yardage to five per cent and
also cut the demand for a 20 per cent
advance for day labor to 10 per cent.
The operators moved to cut the
pending tonnage demand of 3 cents to
2 cents a ton with proportionate de
creases in other demands. This was
refused by the miners and the oper
ators then rejected the proposal of the
workers.

Sees German
Raider Near
East Shores
New York, March 3. A report-that
a German commerce raider or prize
was lurking off Cape Henry, Va., await
ing a favorable chance to make a dash
for Newport News or Norfolk, was
brought here today by Captain Mun
kewitz of the Bull-Insular liner Gray
son, arriving here from Porto Rico.
Captain Munkewitz said that early
yesterday the second officer reported
a mysterious light to the east which
he could not make out The light was
moving eastward and Captain Mun
kewitz altered the course of his ship
when a second light appeared close to
the port side and apparently moving
westward. Both lights disappeared as
suddenly as they had appeared.
On Jan. 23 Captain Munkewitz said,
when he was practically in the same
position several lights were observed
to the east These lights merely flash
ed into view and then vanished and
were succeeded by a green light from
a vessel which crossed the bows of the
Grayson, exchanging signals with the
ship to the east in the Morse code. It
was a few days after this that the Ap
pam took refuge in Hampton Roads.
Captain Munkewitz said heavy
weather and clouds prevailed off the
Virginia coast and that he was satis
fied the vessels whose lights he had
seen were trying to keep their move
ments secret He figured that the
lights did not belong to British cruis
ers, as these patrol ships make no se
cret of their movements.
