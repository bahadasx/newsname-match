By ELLIS GRAHAM, $
Dot regarded the teleBram in het
hand in utter dismay. It was there
in simple letters, the message of her
fate.
"Arrive Tue3day. Gould."
And it was directed to Winifred, of
course, and Winifred was, down at Old
Point Comfort with the Beverlys on
their yacht. She would have to meet
him at last, confess the whole thing,
and protect Winifred somehow.
Winifred had met Clivo Gould lu
Washington, and be had taken a fancy
to her. lie had written to her from
San Francisco the day hofore he
sailed, and Dot had HsMmed to the
letter as she had to with eVery new
correspondent- of her roommate. But
thero was something about the letter
that held her aii underlying faith in
things, a sense of humor, something
that told the real man behind the
peu.

Big Ranch Deal at Elk.
A ranch deal has been closed
in which Arch Brite of Elk sold
Circle J. J. ranch near that
place to James Cady for 15.00
cash. Mr. Biito has been en
gaged in the cattle business near
Elk for several years Ex
"I won t answer It," Winifred had"
said, airily. "He's too dignified audi
slow, Dot." ;
"Oh, you must answer It. He ex
pects" that. Walt, I'll do It for you."
"You . old dear thing," Winifred?
laughed over at her. "You never write
to any boys at all. Go ahead. He's
perfectly safe, bound for Australia
and I don't mind. Hold a star up for.
hi w to see his way by and tell bin
to cheer up." J
But Dot had answered the letter,
in her own way, and it had Btarted a;
correspondence that had slipped out
of her reach and control before a
year had passed. Now he was back,!
and in the letter she had received the'
day before he told her it was her let-'
ters that had drawn him over the!
seas to her, and she jnust fulfill all'
they meant to him. - j
The evening was rather cool. ; Clad!
in a white woolen dress, with white'
sweater and no hat, she watched from i
the veranda until she saw a figure;
start across the green from the street; i
then she went to meet him. Oh, yes; !
1t was he. She knew him In an in-
stant from his picture, and she went,
straight toward him without compro-j
mise.
"You are Mr. Gould, aren't you?"j
She gave him a firm hand clasp. "I:
am Winifred's best friend, and she has-:
gone to Old Point Comfort. Won't'
you visit with me awhile? I am Doro-
thy Page."
t'p on the veranda they sat, while
she listened to him talk of the voy-'
age and trip over the continent.
Couldn't he guess at all of how her
pulses were beating, how she was:
trying to keep her nerve still and lis
ten to him? And all at once some
thing seemed to snap the tension..
She lifted her head and looked at
him, at his wide, uncompromising
eyes, so direct and true in their gaze,:
and she told him the truth as she;
had Intended to do.
"And . that's all, you see." Her
hands put away from her an imag
inary something, when she had fin
ished. "I did it, and I am not sorry
either, Winifred never needed you
and I did. I never had anyone to
write to that I liked, and somehow I
could tc-ll you everything."
"Kxccnt this."
"Don't. I am sorry In a way for
you, but you won't mind. Winifred
has always cared for Bob."
"I'm not thinking of them. I'm sure
1 oriy wish them the greatest happl-.
ness."
"She hasn't been here much the last:
term, not since they were engaged,
She was,taking a poet-graduate course-;
anyway. Oh, I know " She rose and;
stood before him, rebellious, worried,;
and still in a way penitent. "I know:
you must think it was awful of me "';
"No, I don't." He rose, too, and Dot"
wondered how he could leave her so;
soon, with just a word of ordinary;
courteny. After all, the letters had'
been theirs, and they had grown to;
know each other so well In them. But!
Clive continued: ';
"Those letters, whoever wrote them,';
gave me courage and a new grip on,
life Just when I was worried and los-:
ing my grip. Remember that linej
of Browning
'Drop heart's blood where life's wheels ;
grate dry,' . ,""
"That wa3 what they did for t
iid you ftal all the time really imp
sonal toward me, Dot?"
Dot laughtd softly, bit unstead-.'
ily. J
"No, I felt as If you belonged to
me." -
"Just that. And so did I. They;
pulled me back thousands of miles to!
you" .4,
"Not to me. To Winifred." '.
"Winifred wrote to me six month',
ago, as soon as she was engaged to
Bob, and told me the truth," he said.:
"I have come back to you."
"When you didn't even know what
I looked like?" :
"Winifred sent me your portrait aft
er I had asked her for one."
Dot smiled, a funny, half shy smile."
biting her under Up.
"We'll miss the letters terribly."
"I'm not going back," he said. "Not
ror an tne letters in me worm, i
liko the original." ,
"Dear old Win," Dot breathed ten
derly. "Wasn't it clever ot her? '
Across the campus the chapel bell
began to' chime. Clive held her hand
close in his, drawing her nearer to
him.
