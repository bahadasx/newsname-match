Convention At Nashville Will
Be Held May 1 7. Must
Select Delegates Early.
Following the meeting of the
State Democratic Committee,
which ordered a convention to
1 L.n iKTi mi- ir -4m
De neia ai iNasnvine on May ii
for the purpose of nominating
Democratic candidates for Gov
ernor, Railroad Commissioner for
West Tennessee and delegates, to
elect a new state committee and
adopt a party platform, former
Senator Thomas J. Walsh, of
Humboldt, announced his candi
. dacy for Railroad Commissioner.
In a statement Senator Walsh
declares that he favors rotation
in office, and that since Col. B.
A. Enloe has been on the rail
road commission for nearly
twenty years he believes that it
is time for a change.
Senator Walsh has always been
a Democrat. He is recognized
a3 a lawyer of much ability, and
as a member of the State Senate
of 1913 made'an eviable record.
He has a host of friends through
out the State who will support
him. It is expected that he and
Col. Enloe will be the only can
didates, as Homer Reeves, of
Union City, has announced that
he will hot seek the nomination.
Nashville politicians do not
believe that Gov. Rye will have
any very strong opposition should
he decide to be a candidate for
reelection. However, there is
some sentiment against him and
it is not impossible that Judge
S. J. Everett, of Jackson, or
some other Democrat may get
into the fight before the May
convention.
Under the convention plan
adopted, all county delegates
must be selected not later than
April 3. It is expected that a
meeting of the Henry County
Democratic Committee will be
hild within the next week or
two for the purpose of deciding
upon a plan for electing this
county's delegates.

MRS. HEN ON VISIT TO
PARIS FOR FIRST TIME
Numerous hens roosters
too as for that matter have
visited Paris in the past, al
though they usually merely
stopped off here en route to
some foreign market, but one
hen visited this city Tuesday
for thr first time in her life,
and while she came voluntar
ily her owner carried her back
home firmly tied with a strong
cord.
This is the way it happened
"Grandpa" Lilly, who re
sides several miles South of
Paris, started to town in his
buggy early Tuesday morn
ing. He hitched his horse to
the rack near the East court
house yard gate, and about
noon decided to feed -the
animal. Upon Taising the
cover to the back of the buggy
in order to get the feed which
he brought from home, he
found Mrs. Hen sitting there.
It is presumed that Mrs. Hen
was in the habit of laying in
the buggy each, day, at least
an egg was fouad in the buggy
Tuesday, and went on the
nest there Tuesday morning,
as usual. When Mr. Lilly
started to Paris, she detrmin
ed to see the city also, and so
remained in the buggy.
Mr. Lilly was afraid that she
might take such a liking to
the city that she would not be
willing to return to the farm
and so he carried her under
his arm to McGehee's Variety
store, tied her legs together
in order that she might not
run away, and in the after
noon returned to his home
with her.
Mrs. Hen is probably still
telling the other chickens on
Mr. Lilly's farm about her
visit to Paris.

DUDLEY PORTER VERY
G IN OLD PERRY
Newspaper Declares Editorially
That Henry Countian Will
Make Good Race
The political pot is beginning
to boil in the 8th Congressional
District. Dudley Porter of Paris,
who is a candidate for Congress,
was in Linden Tuesday looking
over the situation here. He says
while he failed to win the race
in the last fight, that he has not
become discouraged and fully be
lieves he is going to win this
fight. He further says that that
time he was running against Mr'.'J
Sims, but now Mr. Sims is run
ning against him, for Mr. Sims
ha abandoned the office of Con
gressman and pitched his tent
upon higher grounds, and was
running among the big On's and
while Mr. Sims was thus running
he announced for Congress, and
that now Mr. Sims was running
against him.
Mr. Porter is a deserving
young man, ana has many
friends in this county, and he is
the only opponent that Mr. Sims
has ever had, that has really
made it interesting for Mr. Sims
in this county. . If Mr. Porter's
old friends still believe in him,
and rally around him as of old,
he will make a very creditable
race in this county. Editorial

Judge Edgington9 s Letter
'.'An attempt to fix the jury," "tampering with the Legisla
ture" is the way the Commercial Appeal and other champions of
the Memphis "outs" characterize a letter written to members of
the Legislature by Judge Jesse Edgington, whose impeachment is
sought on charges of bribery.
In this letter Judge Edgington said "All I ask of you is to get
the truth of this matter and not be deceived by the misrepresenta
tions of men with ulterior motives."
This does not read like an effort to influence the Legislature.
The Parisian sees no reason for condemning a man merely because
he has the backbone to put up a fight; merely because he denies
the charges against him. He is presumed to be innocent until
proven guilty, and anyway, to a man up a tree, it would seem no
worse for Judge Edgington to deny his guilt to members of the
Legislature than for a high state official to ask' members of the
State Senate how they intend to vote on Judge Edington'x im
peachment. ' '' . .
If the "jury" is to be "fixed" it might as well be"fixed" by the
defense as by the prosecution.

MAY CALL ON COURTS
IN RQADJ.AW TANGLE
Members of County Court Said
To Favor Settlement By
High Tribunal
In order to settle the con
troversy in regard to whether or
not the old Henry county road
law has been repealed by the act
intended for Haywood and
Robertson counties, the county
court is likely, at its April ses
sion, to authorize proceedings to
to the State Supreme Court, ac
cording to information.
Many members of the county
court, it is said, feel that they
are responsible for the Highway
Commission, as the members of
the commision were elected by
the court, and for that reason
would like to see the tangle
straightened out.
The only way to determine just
where Henry county is "at" in
the way of road statutes makes
it necessary to get a court de
cision on whether or not the old
law has been repealed. If the
court decides to take the matter
up it can be speedily settled at
small cost.
Members of the local bar dis
agree in regard to the repeal of
the law, and for that reason
members of the court believe
that it would be best to have a
court opinion on the matter.

FARMERS SHOULD RAISE
FEED AND NOT COTTON
The Conference of Cotton
States Bankers has issued a
warning to Southern farmers
against raising too much cot
ton this year. The warning is
as follows:
With a shortage of ships to
move our cotton to foreign
shores; with no indication of
the end of the war; with the
Nation stirred over prepared
ness for eventualities; with
the buying power of the en
tire world gradually lessening
day by day, ic becomes our
duty to issue this formal warn
ing as the time of planting
cotton is at hand.
Let everyone encourage the
farmer to be on the safe side
bv raising plenty of feed and
food for the community as
well a3 for himself, his family,
and his live stock. (A calf, a
pig, chickens, and a garden
often mean the difference be
tween want and money ahead. )
Economical and safe living for
all as well as "safe farming"
must be the rule if prosperity
is to abide with us.
Six-cent cotton this fall
would spell disaster in the cot
ton States. Low price follows
over-supply as certainly as the
night the day. High prices
and prosperity over the South
this year prove what volunta
ry reduction of cotton acreage
does. Any marked increase
in acreage over last year is go
ing to result in a great loss to
Southern cotton producers,
merchants, and bankers, and
will similarly affect all allied
business and professions.
