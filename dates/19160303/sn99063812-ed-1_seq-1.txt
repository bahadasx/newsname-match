Onelll, who definitely announced his
cnndldncv for the republican nomina
tion Onelll has been considered as a
candidate for several months, and his
supporters prodlct ho will make a
strong run. Prior to coming to Klam'-

Ho Is known to be a 'keen student,
with a deep knowledgo of his pro

announced himself as a candidate.
His friends aro certain that he will
do so at no late date. Thus far,

After sounding out that fickle,

tho brush of indecision and enter tho
rnco for sheriff on tho republican
ticket. Gowen made a splendid
lecord as sheriff In his two terms,
inOO-1004. and he claims a good
backing in his new campaign.
Yet nnother candidate for sheriff
on tho democratic ticket Is announced.
This Is James Moore, pioneer resident

PETROGRAD, March 3. Russia's
new premier, M. Sturmer, is making
a good impression His appointment
ns M. Goremykln's successor was a
surprise. He is sixty-eight years of
age and has passed his wholo life In
government offices

simply Tis a bureaucrat. The public
knew him hardly at all. He was un

its satisfaction at his retirement, but
it had few words of welcome for his
hiiccessor.
i Nevertheless, Mr. Sturmer's initial
statement of his policy was well re
ceived. Evidently he did not want to be
considered a reactionary. He spoke
in friendly terms of the duma and
.hinted that he expects it to take an
'active part in affairs when It resumes
jits session sometime this month.
Of the war he said: "We must win.
j There can be no talk of a separate
I peace for us, nor can the threat of
I exhaustion alarm us. How can this
great country, so rich naturally and
'every day disclosing fresh treasues,
I be exhausted." If words count, It Is
the growing opinion that the new pre
mier will be a success.
