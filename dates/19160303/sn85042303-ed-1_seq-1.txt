STYLE SHOW WEEK MER
CHANTS FORTUNATE.
The Merchants' Association met at
the court house last night and heard
the report of President Krueger, who
attended the style show in Dallas. Mr.
Krueger made an interesting talk, and
gave all present the benefit of his in
vestigations. The general plans for Ardmore's
big week in April were discussed and
the program for the full week is al-
I most complete.
It developed at the meeting that
Ardmore merchants would have some
interesting demonstrations for the
spring shoppers, and that some elabo
rate arrangements were being made.
M. M. I.ykins will bead the enter
tainment committee, with Mr. Akers
and three ladies as the full committee.
The names of the ladies will be an

will take care of the musical arrange
ments, and special attractions for the
week. There are promised some splen
did attractions, one of which will be
the Clifford Pevereau company from
New York, secured especially for one
night during the week. Altogether,
the members of the association are
gratified at the progress made to
ward making Ardmore's first style
show a success.
The United States Fifth Artillery

OFFICERS SAY SEVERAL NEGROES
IDENTIFIED HiM AS A STRAN
GER WHO ACTED QUEER. CUL
PRIT IS STILL AT LARGE.
From Investigation of tin" officers
issigned to limit down the negro that
assaulted -Mrs. James l'ayne day b
fore yesterday, it is proven beyond
question that the negro was crazy. Sev
eral people saw him previous to the
as.-ault, and the negroes all say that
he was a stranger and acted very
1 queer, lie was continually laming
about wood yards and chopping wood,
'and told one negro with whom he was
'riding that he owned a wood yard in
Ardmore and was seeking a supply
for bis customers.
Deputy Gimi who knows every ne
gro in the Caddo bottoms, stated this
morcing that he believed the stories
told him about the negro. He says
the negroes in all the settlements
along the river were anxious to cap
ture the culprit and felt sure that he
had followed the course of Caddo to
a railroad crossing, and probably was
far away by this time.
A close watch is being kept in all
directions, however, and if captured,
he will be returned here to answer
for his crime.

CAPITAL CITY IS ANXIOUS AND
BENDING EVERY EFFORT TO
GET CAPITAL INTERESTED IN
PROPOSED ROAD.
The following item from The Okla
homa City Times Is of local inter
est, and is given for what it is worth.
It might not be out of place, bow-
ever, in passing, to remind those in
terested in the growth of Ardmore
that "where there is smoke there is
lire," and that the cheapest and best
way to combat any competition is by
making Ardmore the best place and1
the easiest place in which to live.
There are two great and growing
needs, both of which are being given
consideration now : A new hotel and
a gooil road to the oil fields.
" 'That proposed railroad from
Kingling to Oklahoma City is perhaps
nearer realization than many people
believe,' said J. I). Shaffer, an Ard
more oil man, at the Skirvin.
" From information that has come
to me. I believe that actual construc
tion on the line will begin in a few
months. Moreover, it is the impress
ion among railroad men that back of
the proposition is the ultimate de
sign of a new grain route from the
wheat belt to the gulf coast. In other
words, such a line might eventually
give the Vnion Pacific system a very
good short line to the gulf coat.'"

WHISKY CASES ARE BEING DIS
POSED OF BY THE COURT WITH
SMALL COMFORT TO ALL DE
FENDANTS IN THE CASE.
Whi . ky eases continue to occupy the
attention of the district court, with
small comfort to the defendants in
the various cases. They say that the
best tiiey expect is the worst of it at
the hands of the present jury which
seems to have a propensity of finding
them guilty and fixing their punisli
nieM with cost, line and jail sentence.
Ten cases have been tried so far
which have resulted in nine convic
tionsone seemed to be lucky, and
"got by." This does not include those
who were tried in connection with oth
ers and acquitted, while the principal
named in the case was fined; the lat
ter, however, number but three.
Yesterday afternoon the jury iu the
case of the Stale vs. Mike Miller re
turned a verdict of guilty and fixed
the punishment at fifty dollars fine
and thirty days in jail. C. O. Hopkins
for the same offense, got the same
dose. The bond of Karl lirooks,
charged with larceny from the person,
was forfeited, and an alias warrant
issued.
PATENTEE OF DEVICE FOR COT
TON GIN STANDS WILL GIVE
A PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION
TO GIN MEN NEXT WEEK.
C. W. Seguin of San Antonio, pat
entee of a device to attach to cotton
gin stands which it is claimed will in-
lease the profit of the cotton grow er ,
has been in the city lor several davsi.
and lias decided to locate here.
George Terry, who was instrument
al in having Mr. Seguin come to Ard
more, stated yesterday that he bad
sent to Memphis for his model and
as soon as it arrived would advertise
a tl.it e and give a demonstration of
w hat. he machine would do. Th"
tacl'.men! can lie placed on any or
dinary gin stand and is so simple in
operation that any ordinary gin oper
alor can use it. It requires nothin
special to attach, and Mr. Seguin
tela ronfid-'tit that the gin men of
this section will adopt his invention
as soon as they se'. a practical dem
onstration of what it will do.
Mr. Terry, who is interested with
Mr. Seguin in getting this device
it.'roduced in this section, stated that
they hope to have the model here by
Wednesday, at. least. The future plans
of the patentee will depend entirely
upon what the gin men of this section
if the state think of his invention
af'er they see it in operation.
