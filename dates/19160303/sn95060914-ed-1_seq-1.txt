TWENTY SECOND YEAR
E
I CANAL IN
STATE OF ARIZONA
When Completed Will Be
Owned by Farmers of
the Gila Valley
WILL COST NEARLY 30000
Expense of Maintainance Will
Be Reduced to 50 Cents
Pea Acre
The largest canal in the Slate
that is owned by the farmers them
selves is now being built by the
San Jose Montezuma Consolidated
Canals
The proposition for consolidate
ing the canals or the valley has
been talked of for years by the
farmers but it remained for the
tremendous floods of the Gila
river during January which washed
away the San Jose canal for nearly
half a mile to bring the farmers
together on a plan for consolida
tion which it finally did and now
with a very few exceptions every
body concerned is enthusiastic
over the adoption of the plan by
which the San Jose and Monte
zuma canals were consolidated
After the floods had subsided
and the extent of the damage to
the canals was known a number
of the stockholders and especially
the boards of directors of the two
canals began to work for consoli
dation
A meeting was called at Safford
and the boards of directors of the
three largest canals in the county
were invited to be present The
invitation to attend this meeting
was also extended to the stock
holders of the three companies
The meeting was largely attended
1 his meeting decided to call a
stockholders mreting to be held
aWthehead of theSanMbsetcanal
or above it to determine what was
the best thing to do This meeting
was also well attended but the
stockholders could not get together
on any plan for consolidation
Some wanted to go to the box
canyon for the head of the canal
and others wanted to establish the
head about one half mile above
the old San Jose head
Consolidation pf the three canals
appearing to be lost a meeting of
the boards of directors of the San
Jose and Montezuma canals was
called All the members of both
boards attended This meeting re
sulted in an agreement being
drawn up and signed by the board
of directors of the two canals the
agreement to be ratified by the
stockholders at a subsequent meet
ing
The stockholders were notified
personally and the meeting proved
to be the largest stockholders
meeting ever held in the history of
the companies At this meeting the
agreement signed by the boards
of directors of the two canal com
panies was ratified by an over
whelming majority and the work
of construction was arranged for
at once
Under the agreement a new
head was to be built for about two
miles and then dropping off into
the old San Jose canal and en
larging it to a capacity sufficient to
carry water for the two canals
It was agreed that the Monte
zuma Company should pay five
ninths of the expense and the San
Jose four ninths this proposition
being based upon the decree of
the court regulating the amount of
land each canal was entitled to
have water for
David HCIaridge was appointed
general superintendent of construc
tion and also treasurer Under
Mr Claridges supervision work
was commenced at once The
boards of directors also took an
active part in the work of super
vision
A carload of cement was or
dered at once along with a supply
of new scrapers Lumber and
other necessary supplies were or
dered and delivered on the
ground
The new canal is 36 feet wide
on the top and 25 feet wide on the
bottom and has a uniform grade
of 3 feet I inch to the mile The
new canal will hold enough water
for the three largest canals in the
valley
About 136 teams and from 3U
to 60 men are employed working
all the time and the first two miles
was completed last week Large
cement head gates and waste gates
are being constructed of such a
permanent nature that they will
never be destroyed and the nature
of the land through which the new

canal runs and the splendid head
gives promise of a permanency
that has never been enioved be
fore by the farmers of this volley
It is estimated that the cxnense
of maintainance after this work is
completed will not be moie than
40 to 50 cents per year as acainst
90 cents to 150 as heretofore
This expense of maintainance for
the new canal will probably be the
owest in the State
The splendid assistance civen to
the farmers in the construction of
this large canal by the local bank
ers shows that they have confi
dence in this enterprise and are
loyal to the farmers with whom
they are dealing in this valley The
total cost of this project when
completed will be nearly 30000
Cash is being paid for everything

who have been negligent in observ
ing this general clean up movement
and have unsightly and unsanitary
yards The club has secured the
cooperation of the town council in
this work and they will enforce the
law rigidly from now on
A permanent fly campaign has
been established and tree planting

Since the organization of the club
we have joined- the State Federa
tion of Womens Clubs and have
sent a delegate to the annual meet
ings hoping to get a broader view
point
We are working in perfect har
mony with the town council the
chamber of commerce and all other
organizations here and we feel that
they all realize that we are a worth
while organization
We have no membership fee but
raise money byglvlngrbazaars cake
and home cooked food sales and
dances also a charge of ten cents is
made for the refreshments served
at our social meqtings and while
this is a very small amount it places
a nice sum in the treasury of our
club once a month
We meet once every two weeks
at the M E Church for our busi
ness meetings and every two weeks
at the different residences of our
members and all classes and creeds
are welcome
We have secured the promise of
two rooms in the new court house
building upon its completion for a
rest room and reading room We
hope to have on file in the reading
room reading matter of interest to
the entire community also ready
reference files for all information
for the farmer no matter what he
may desire to knew about the soil
crop etc
Our next step will be the inspec
tion of the slaughter houses This
is a most important item for the
health of the community
The next important inspection to
be taken up is that of out houses
of toilets and cess pools There is
a law recently passed compelling
sanitary toilets and closed cess pools
and this law will be rigidly enforced
by the town council
We hope also to establish a
Weed Day when an effort will
be made to get everyone to cut and
burn his weeds It has been sug
gested that the club engage a man
with a team and mower to cut the
weeds along the sidewalks and non
resident owned property and then
petition the town council to finish
the job This would encourage
citizens all over town to get busy
and weed cutting and buming would
be a daily occurrence
We ask the cooperation of the
citizens to make our town clean
beautiful and sanitary and extend
an invitation to all to secure plants
at the park Saturday as a first step
to beautifying our grounds
The regular business meeting of
the club was held Friday afternoon
at the M E Church with a very
good attendance of members
This meeting completed the term
of the officers who have presided
for the past year and a vote of
thanks was extended by the club to
Mrs W D French to whose un
tiring efforts are due the success
ful year just passed The new
officers take their scats in March
