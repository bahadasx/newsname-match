NUMBER 9
TO CHECK BLACKLEG
J- C. Taylor Writes Concern
ing This Disease.
Every stock grower should be
on the alert for the appear
ance of blackleg in his herd or
within the eomunity. The dis
ease caused considerable loss last
fall and winter, and the section?
that had losses may have a re
ocurrenceof the trouble this
spring. Animals dying from the
disease were not always proper
ly desposed of, and where such
cases occured it will pay to be
doubly cautious. Watch your
herds closely and if they were
not vaccinated last fall, do so at
your earliest opportunity.
You had better order your vac
cine right now and have it on hand
for you will want to vaccinate be
fore turning vour stock out any
way. Goverment vaccine may be
secured free of charge from your
state veterinarian, or at Wash
ington, D. C. Do not wait, but
get it now.
Blackleg is a most virulent,
rapidly fatal, infectious disease
of young cattle. All young cattle
that have begun to forage for
themselves are most susceptible
until they are two years old.
Cattle over two years old may
become affected but such cases
are infrequent. It is a mistake
to believe that only the fat cattle
contract this disease,for cattie in
poor condition, run-down vitality,
are probably just as susceptible
and do become infected.
Tne symptoms of blackleg are
very characteristic and easily rec
ognized by a careful examination.
The most important symptom is
the swelling which invariable ac
companies the disease, occurring
under the skin and located on the
thighs, the shoulders, the neck,
flank or the rump. When strok
ed or handled a peculiar crackling
sound is heard under the skin,
due to a collection of gas formed
by the germs as they multiply.
It is a well established fact that
the germ which causes the dis
ease will live in moist soil for
three years and still produce in-!
fection. Being enclosed in a thick
case, or spore as it is called, it is
very resistant to cold, and when !
kept in darkness will live for a
number of years. These minute
organisms gain entrance to the
tissues and muscles through
wounds and abrasions of the skin;
sometimes by the mouth, tongue
or throat; slight wounds caused
by stubble, barbed wire, thorns,
briars, sharp or pointed parts of
food.
There is no cure for the disease,
but a prevention. Whenever a
victim dies the carcass should be
promptly burned or buried deep j

and covered with quicklime, to
prevent the spread of infection,
which is conveyed by animals or
birds who eat of the carcass.
Use every precaution cleaning!
up, disinfect all sheds or stalls
where sick
animals have been,
and burn all the litter where the
dead animal has been bedded.
Keep your herd vaccinated at
all times with a vaccine from a
reliable company, for it is the
only successful way of combating
and preventing the disease.
Calves should be vaccinated as
soon as they are old enough to eat
forage. It is best to vaccinate
early in the spring before turning
the herd out on the range, and
again in the fall when taking
them in. If you use the pellet
form, be careful the pellet does
not roil out before injecting the
needle. Roll the pellets in vase
line or lard so they will adhere
to the needle.
The loss of one animal will
more than pay for vaccination or
the entire herd in many cases,
so it looks like a pretty good
economy to spend a little monev
as a precautionary measure. Do
not wait until blackleg appears
in your herd. Do it now. — J. C.
Taylor, Custer County Agricul
