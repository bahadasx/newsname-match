In Macon Monday uight alight
hearted young girl was on her way
home to dress for a Valentine par
ty at her church. 1 Down the street,
at forty miles an - hour, came an
. dutomobile. In the car were a
chauffeur and a man who was in a
' drunken stupor, The ".drunkard
shot the. youug ' girl through , the
heartV He tireif five other shots
and his automobile' sped onward.
He' was not acquainted' with the
girl he killed. ' . ' ' . ,
This shocking tragedy causes the
Macon News to say:- '. ,
"To just such pitiable tragedies
aud awful, crimes as that com
mitted in Macon last night, when
a drunken man shot and killed an
innocent, light-hearted girl whom
V lie did not even know, may be at
tributed the spread of prohibition.
It has been well said that 'Babylon
in all its desolation is- a sight not
. ao awful as that of the human mind
in ruins,' aud there is no time when
bhis spectacle is so appalling as
when the intellect is overcome by
liquor and dethroned of its reason.
In time to come not only the man
who commits a crime when under
' the influence of liquor will be pun
ished for his crime, but also the
man who sold him the brain poison.
Morally,' now, the latter is an ac-
; complice in guilt, and upon his
head rests a share of the responsi
bility for the taking of a useful life.
Is there - any wonder, therefore,
, that there are converts every day
. to the cause of prohibition1? Also,,
can one wonder at the increasing
sentiment in favor of prohibiting
the sale, if not . the manufacture,.
of- pistols, the ' deadly hip-pocket
weapon which, in the hands of the
man crazed with strong drink, has
wrecked so many lives and homes?"
"And. what of the protection, of
innocent young girls from such
tragedies a& as-that in Macon? Is
it not the duty of mankind to make
i&uch tragedies impossible?' In or
der to do this three things are nec
essarylaws against pistol-toting
nnd- against liquor selling,, 'men
who have courage to enforce these
laws and a determination on the
part of the citizenship to hold the
officers of the law accountable. In
prohibition "territory an officer is
jnstas much obligated to enforce
the laws against boot-legging as he
is to enforce the laws against sale
of liquor over bars. Officials who
don't realize that will be. awakened
by the people some day, and the
Awakening . will be' a-' rude one,

THE LEAST - OF THESE.
A few weeks ago a decision of
the Supreme Court of one of oar
Southern States made legal a bill
abolishing capital punishment,and,
Vaa it happenedrby its timely action
saved from-the electric chair as pa-
" thetic an example of the evil results
of ignorance and bad environment
as Could well be. imagined. ' This
eriminal was only a pitiful boy,
with dull and frightened eyes and
a childish mouth whose drpoping
weakness showed none of the brav-
. 'ery that might have helped him
face his gruesome death. . He was
the son of an illiterate ' mow ntain
woman whose life of endless -and
hopeless drudgery failed to. feed
and clothe the eleven children that
were here. - He was an outlaw in a
eommuuity so bitter and hard of
"" fceart that the despairing and help
less mother was ostracised when
,het Bn- was taken, to iail ; . '
In ignorant helplessness and
wrongdoing, this boy was a com
panion victina,to the murdered girl
for whose sake Leo Frank met his
tragic death. - ,
Poor little Mary Fngan, dead
and in her grave,, was all but for
gotten while the world wagged its
head and wrangled oVer a climax
to the-matter so fearful that its
real significance fell out of sight.
For the fate of Mary Fagau's mur
derer, whoever he was aud however
he met his fate, was not the heart
of the question. ,
' It was the girl herself, childishly
young,, ill-fed; ill-paid, ill-clothed
and all unprotected, a pitiful prey
to the first tempter that came her
way it is the dead girl who gives
the tragic- heart to the story. '
. And like her,, the boy, now a
prisoner foe life in a State peni
tentiary, must bear the punishment
of a whole community's sins and
must pay the penalty of -the great
world's forgetfulnessandneglect. r

WHY
PRINCE
WINS.
ALBERT
Smokers so much appreciate the
flavor and coolness and aroma of
Prince Albert pipe and cigaiette
tobacco that they often marvel that
this one brand could be so different
from all others. '
The auswer to. this question is
to be found on the reverse side of
every Prince Albert package, where
you will read r "Process patented
July 30,. 1907." That tells the
whole story. Prince Albert is
made by a patented process .that
cuts put the bite and parch, which
makes the tobacco so mighty agree
able and satisfying to men of every
taste of every civilized nation on
the globe. " : ; ,
- Smokers should realize that this
patented process cost three years'
work and study and a fortune in
money to perfect. But the result
has proven to be worth all that was
expended upon it, because it 'has
set free men who believe they never
eould-enjoy a pipe or a makiu's
cigarette. .; '. v j
Prince Albert makes it possible
for every man to smoke a pipe or
to roll his own cigarettes. , And,
no matter how tender the tongue,
Prince Albert caii not bite or parch,
This- is cut out by the patented
process, leaving for the smoker
only the joys of the fragrant to
bacco, ';,
It is a fact that since Prince
Albert "arrived,", just about six
years ago, it has made three men
smoke pipes where one smoked a
pipe before! - . '

NEW ENGINES" '
ARE INSTALLED
Nashville,LTeun.,Tebriiary 14
With, the delivery of three Mallet
compound engines recently pur
chased by the Nashville, Chatta
nooga and St. Louis Railway for
use iu operating their heavy freight
trains over the mountain on the
Chattanooga division near Cowan,
that road will have in operation the
heaviest locomotives in the South.
These engines each have a trac
tive force of 99,000 pounds. The
total weight of engine and tender is
620,000 pounds or 310 tons and
each engine has sixteen drivers,
eight cylinders, and weighs, exclu
sive of the tender, 470,000 pounds.
These mammoth locomotives are
about the size of two ordinary large
engines and are known as the most
powerful type of locomotive. .
Within the past year the Nash
ville, Chattanooga and St. Louis
Railway has increased its locomo-j
tive equipment by the addition of
several new Mikado type freight
engines and Pacific type passenger
locomotives, these engines being
rated among the most powerful of
their type. In other words,.the
management is endeavoring to fur
nish the shippers and the traveling
public the best service possible,
and the powerful Mallets soon to
be delivered are but another evi
dence that the road is keeping up
with the latest ideas in railroading.
The. road is also building 1,000
steel-underframe.box cars at its
shops here and has added between
100 and 150 men to its shop forces
in order, to facilitate, this work.
The cars are being completed at
the rate of , ten a day, and as a re
sult of this work the road is put
ting in circulation in the various
trade channels between $3,000 and
$10,000 a mouth above its usual
shop payroll. , '.

with obstacles, dont give up; put
your trust in Him who said "what
soever ye ask in my name that will
I give," and you will conquer, never
fear, for a church without mission
ary workers is a dejid church. "
If I were an artist and asked to
paint a picture of a dead church,
would 'seek the best architect I
could find and from his designs
would paint the finest building the
world has ever, seen;.. Solomon's
Temple would not compare -in
beauty and grandeur to the church
I would throw on the cauyas,
I would, paint the furniture o
that church of the finest mahogany
I would paint golden chandaliers
aud the best pipe orgau inventive
genius could ' produce would be
painted in this, church.1 The jani
tor and ushers would be dressed in
the most costly apparel ; . the collie
tio'n box would be filled to over
flowing with gold to pay the pastor
and for the upkeeping of this dead
church. ' , '
Back in one corner I would paint
the box that contained the offering
for. missions, and around this box
I would paint a cobweb all "covered
with dust; iu the opening of this
box, instead of a twenty dollar gold
piece, I would print, a grim old
spider. , Beneath thisbox I would
paint three kneeling figures one
that of a .' church . member, aud
around his neck I would place the
obligations he took (when he join
ed .the church) to support the
church and all its institutions; the
second would be a .woman, with
outstretched hands and streaming
eyes crying "come over and help
us lest we die." . v .
The third would be the skeleton
of a child, and around its bony
neck I would hang a card painted
in letters of fire "Lost! Lost! Oh,
eternally lost! Ten, thousand .like
me lost anuuallv because' none
would give'to send someone to lead
us to Him who commissioned His
deciples to go iuto all the world
and preach 'the gospel to every
creature." There are untold mil
lions today who have never heard
of the gospel. God help all of us
to do our duty and His bidding
and deliver us from a dead church.

A FEW WORDS
OF WARNING
With a shortage of ships to move
our cotton to foreign shores;' with
no indication of the end of the war.;
with the' Nation stirred over pre
paredness for eventualities; with ,
the buying power of the entire
world gradually lessening day by
day,'it becomes our duty to issue
this formal warniug as the time of,
planting cotton is near at hand;
Let everyone encourage the far
mer to be on the safe side by rais
ing plenty, of feed aiid food for, the
community as well as for himself,
his family and his live stock. (A
calf, a pig, chickens and a garden
often mean the difference between
want and money ahead.)
Economical and safe living for
all as well as "safe farming" must
be the rule if prosperity is toabidV '
with us.' . '
Six-cent cotton this fall would
spell disaster in the' cotton States.
Low price follows over-supply as -
certainly as the night the day.
High prices and prosperity over
the South this year prove what
voluntary reduction of cotton acre
age does. Any marked increase, in
acreage over last year is going to
result iu great loss to Southern
cotton producers, merchants and
bankers, and will similarly affect
all allied business and professions.'
The above warning was issued
last week by Conference of Cotton
States Bankers. The question may
arise, . what . is the Conference of
Cotton States Bankers? We 'will
endeavor to explain.. . ; . 4
Bankers and other busy men
dropped, their, work and traveled
from all parts of the South aud at
tended three meetings within four '
months at different cities to organ- .
lze and lurtuer tue work of tne
Conference of the Cotton States
Bankers Association, organized at
Galveston, Tex., August 14, 1915.
A smaller group, as a committee,
finished the important organization
details at a meeting at Birmingham,
Ala., herd August26,1916. A third ,
meeting, the largest of them all, -was
held at New Orleans December,
6 and 7, and the conference, now a
permaueut iustitiou, will hold an- -nual
meetings hereafter. -
Briefly stated, the" purpose of the
conference is to deal with problems
peculiar to the States where cotton
he South's most important com
modity, is grown. Broadly speak
ing, all of these problems affect the
development and prosperity of the
cotton States' and every one in
them. Unsolved problems of years
standing. regarding loans on cotton.
warehousing, marketing, etc., as re-
ated to other lines of business are
being vigorously dealt with.. The
diversified crop moyemeut of 1915
which saved the South untold mil- ;
ions of dollars was largely fostered -
by the conference. : The officers of
