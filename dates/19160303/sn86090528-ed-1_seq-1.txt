G MAJORITY SENATE SUal AJNS
FOREIGN POLICY OF PRESIDENT WILSON
WARNING RESOLUTION
OF GORE GOES DOWN
IN DRAMATIC DEFEAT
James Leads Fight and Owen Votes
yith Administration; Score is 68
to 14 for Wilson's Position; Sim

Follow Quickly in House
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, I). ('., March 3.
The senate today gave formal notice
to Via world that it stands 'behind.
President Wilson, particularly in the
foreign policies that he is pursuing at
the present time
Hy a vote of 6S to 14 the senate re
jected the resolution offered by .S'na
tor Gore, -warning American ci'izens
to keep off ot armed merchantmen or
belligerent countries.
It was exactly ten minxes and
lerty seconds from the time the fight
i n the resolution began after the sen
ate convened at U o'clock this morn
ing until the vice president announced
the vote.
. Amid the most dramatic scene stag
ed in the niul lace the Unitod
States declared war against Spain, the
senate by a single roll call swept aside
not only the Ocre resolution but all
the amendments and substitutes that
were offered and thus clinched de
cisively the whole, question in favor
of the administration.
, Senator Owen of Oklahoma, Senator
Slieppard and Culbertsou of Texas
and Senator Clarke of Arkansas were
nniong thoe who voted ti iuritain the
president s position. Senator Gore also
cast iiis vote with the majority, out
only that he might lodge a motion for
reconsideration.
The administration leaders were
ruthlesr in giving the d":itli blow to
all opposition to the president, fter
the vote ou the Gore resolution was
taken. Senator Stone tried to call up
the resoluum of Senator Jones which
declared tlijjt before breakm? off di
plomatic relation or sending the
eouivHlent of an ultimatum to any
foreign power the president should
consult the senate, but Jones withdrew
his resolution, saying he would it.tro
cuce it again.
Cere sprung an unexpected move at
the eleventh hour by offering what
was pratically a new resolution and an
ultimatum to the central powers. This
move cau?ed sereral changes in votes
The senators considered that (Vires;
new resolution amounted, practically j
. to notice to Germany that war would :
I declared by the United States upon
the killing of a single American by - J
subimtrlne attacking a merchantman
without warning.
, Senator James of Kentucky lead the j
administration's fight on the floor ol
the senate. Senators Stone, Varda-
man, Smoot and Clarke vainly tried
to explain their votes, 'but James roar
od forth objections, his point" ot order
being sustained by Vice President Mar
shall. Senator Borah protested vigor
ouslr against "gngging" the senate.
Tt is expected that similar action
wil follow quickly In the house, thus
clearing the way for the state depart
ment to resume the Lusliania negotia
tions with Germany.
While the senate debated late yester
day there came news to the state de
partment from Berlin which convinced
officials that the dissension in con
rross was being used deliberately to
veaken the president's hand in Ger
many. ' Confidential advices state ttmt im

Out of the senate debate came a turn
tvHch for the moment threatened to
overshadow the real features of the

puniest aim i""'""".
tasis f(.r tho agitation at the capi
tal. Senator Gore, while the snate sat
tapt in amazement related a story
that President Wilson, at his confer
ence with leaders a week ago, bad
decided that Germany's insistence on
her position in the submarine contro
versy probably would result In a
breach of diplomatic relations; that
breach probably would be followed
by war; and that "a state of war
mmht not of itself and of necessity
i.e an evil to this republic, but that thd
I'uited States by entering upon war
row might W able to bring it to a
conclusion by midsummer and thus
render a great service to civiliza
tion." Senator Core claimed he did not say
the story was true, 'bu that it came Vi
him with such a concurrence of. testi
mony and uch marks of truth that ho
did not feel that he could discharge
his duty as a senator and withhold
it.
Chairman Stone of, the forelpn rela
tions committee, at once replied that
the president never had stated to him
nor in his hearing that he believed,
or in any way entertained the thought
that war between, the United, States
and Germany would bo desirable or
wniiM result in eood to the United
.states. When the White House heard
what Senator Gore had said, this state
ment was issued:
"When the attention of the White
House was called to certain statements
In Senator Gore's speech this afternoon
the president authorized an unqualified
(ienlal of any utterance to. which any
auch meaning could be attached."
It was explained or. hU behalf thai
the president had told the congress
men he could not predict what would
follow a breaking off of diplomatic re
lations, and had expressed in the most
vigorous terms his hope that the Unit
ed States would not be drawn into war
l aud his determination to continue to
bend his every effort to prevent it. it
was denied that the president said airv
thina to convey the impression that
he desired the United States to enter
the war to shorten it or for any other
u.asoni but he reiterated the necessity
()f upholding the national honor of the
T-mted States at all costs

WASHINGTON", V. C. March C--Spectacular
in a display of magnifi
cent gowns and handsome uniforms,
the White House promises a most glittering-assemblage
to night whe: the
President and Mrs. Wilson will hold
a reception for army and navy offi
cers. Shimmering traid, sparkling
medals and clanking swords will pre
dominate. The army and navy recetpion always
is welcomed as the most colorful event
in White House circles. It has been
anticipated by scores of requests for
invitations from the young ladies of
Washington who are anxious to see
and meet Uncle Sam's handsome land
and sea officers. For weeks the
White House clerks have been besier:
ed from ail sources to use thoir best
efforts toward invitations for tne
event.
But these beteachings have proved
. . 1 IT
futile, since the first reception neiu
this winter. Fairly overwhelmed by
the crowd which swept into the White
House at the Pan-American reception,
the President and Mrs. Wilson decided
to do much of their own selecting o.
guests. The president's aides hav

ably embarrassed when prominent per

The B'rench positions on Pepper

Extermination of Germany Not Anticipated

(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
LONDON, Feb. 20. (By Mail.)
The nations of Europe will line up in
four groups after the war This is the
English guess, made by excellently in
formed Britons.
The English never expect to see the
"United States of Europe," so much
talked about in Norway, Sweden, Den
mark and Holland. There are too
many kinds of people in Europe, and
the different) kinds are too different to
federate, the English say.
Of course there are plenty of Eng
lish dissenters from the opinion that
this four-group line up will follow the
war. It is a theory, however, held by
first class judges; and seems to come
nearer to having a plurality of support
ers than any other one. Roughly, tha
four groups will consist of:
1. England, France, Russia and
Italy.
2. T he Germanic nations.
3. The Scandinavian countries
Sweden, Norway and Denmark.
4. Tho Balkan states.
No. 1, it will be seen. Is the present
entente line up. The English opin
ion is that Italy, originally allied with
Germany and Austria-Hungary, (but
now on the entente's Bide, will stay
on tho latter side. Some pessimists
predict that the war's end will not
find England and Russia on good terms
but this isn't the general view.
As to what Germany and Austria
Hungary w ill or will not gain or losa
as a result ot the war, there are no
end of different predictions. To choose
between them is unnecessary suffice
it to say that the English don't ex
pect the Germans to be actually ex
terminated or their country partitioned
in its entirety.
It is conceded that there w.Tl still bo
a Germany.
That any Austria-Hungary will b
left, bQwever, as an individual country,
or rather dual country, is not so readily
conceded. Plenty of people bellevo
Austria-Hungary will he merged in
Germany by the time the peace settle
ment has been agreed on
This would leave the Germanic peo
ples not exactly in a group but one sin
gle country, with Austria-Hungary as
one or several of its states.
The get-together tendency In Scandi
navia ha3 been noticeable for some
time. There is a good deal of jealousy
between Sweden and Denmark, but it
is not more than skin deep. One thing
will have to tx settled Denmark
strongly smti-German because she
fears Germany, Norway is somewhat
i:ro-English and yet afraid of Russia,
and Sweden Is so extremely afraid ot
Russia as to be decidely pro-German.
The theory is that Russia with fur
nish satisfactory insurance against ag
gression by the czar across the ex
treme northern end ot the Scandi
navian peninsula. This would change
Sweden's feelings, remove a certain
amount of worry in Norway and leav.j
nothing in the way of what should
prove a desirable combination a fed
eration, almost.
The British idea is that there can t
be the right sort of a situation in
the Balkans until the Turks have been
transferred across the Bosphorus Into
