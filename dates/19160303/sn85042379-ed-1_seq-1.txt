Havre Triumphs by 20 to 15
Score—Game Very Close.
By defeating Glasgow in the final
game of the tournament held at
Havre Friday and Saturday, the
Havre team earned the title of
"champions" of this part of the state.
The tournament began Friday
night with Glasgow and Chinook
matched against each other, and from
the first whistle until final time was
called, the teams struggled, both
playing excellent basketball, but the
superior team work and basket shoot
ing of the Glasgow boys won for
them, the final score being 29 to 24.
Captain Helland's ability to drop the
oval through the hoop on free throws
really won the game for Glasgow.
Waldum and Wall also played consist
ently and figured strongly in the
scoring column. The summary of
this game follows:
Glasgow. Chinook.

Glasgow-Havre Game.
The district championship was
settled Saturday night when the win
ners of the Friday night games met,
Glasgow having defeated Chinook and
Havre having won from Fort Ben
ton.
Speaking of this game the Havre
Promoter says:
"The championship game between
Glasgow and Havre, in which Havre
won by a score of 20 to 15, is prob
ably the fastest game of basketball
every played on the homé floor. Up
to this game Glasgow, had an un
broken string of victories to their
credit, and Havre was determined to
wipe off the stain on their record,
gained on January 7, when the Valley
county boys defeated them at Glas
gow. As usual with all of Havre's
games of this year, it was a game in
which close guarding was a feature
and it was impossible to run up any
large score against the home aggre
gation."
In this game Captain Heiland of
the locals again distinguished him
self and scored all of Glasgow's
points, eleven of them on free throws.
Koppang also came in for special
mention among the spectators at the
tournament, as his defensive playing
was the best ever seen on the Havre
floor.
The summary of the game follows:
Glasgow. Havre.

MONTANA LEADS IN WOOL.
Interesting figures showing Mon
tana's importance as the chief wool
producing state of the union are
contained in the last quarterly bul
letin of the National Association of
Wool Manufacturers, copy of which
was recieved yesterday by Seth Max
publicity.
"According to the bulletin, Montana
well, commissioner of agriculture and
led all the states of the union in the
number of sheep sheared, the number
of pounds of scoured wool and the va
lue of the products on the Boston
market. The bulletin shows that Mon
tana's 1915 wool crop was-worth $7,
302, 437 to the growers of this stat^,
or over one-tenth of the total value
of the wool product of the nation.
There has been considerable dis
cussion during recent weeks as to
whether Montana or Wyoming led the
wool production of the nation. This
bulletin, which is the standard auth
ority of the wool industi 'y, gives the
award to Montana. This 'state
sheared 3,725,000 sheep Jast^yenr^as
against 3,630,000 in Wyoming."- ' >i; '
The average Wyoming fleecfe,' how
ever weighed eight pounds 1 las UgainSt
seven and seven-tenths in Montana,
this giving Wyoming a slight lead in
the amount of unscoured wool, the
figuress being 29,040,000 pounds for
Wyoming as against 28,682,000
pounds for Montana.
The percentage of shrinkage how
ever, when the wool was cleaned, was
against 66 for that of Wyoming this
but 62 for the Montana product as
giving Montana 10,899,160 pounds of
scoured wool as against 9,873,600
pounds in Wyoming.
The Montana grower, likewise, pro
duced better wool than his neighbor
in Wyoming, as is shown by the fact
that the average price of Montana
scoured wool was 67 cents as against
66 cents in its cheif competing state.
This price gave to the Montana pro
duct a total value of $7,302,437 as
against the Wyoming value of$6,516,
576.
None of the other states anywhere
near approached the records of Mon
tana and Wyoming. Idaho is third
with a wool production valued at $4
994,232; New Mexico is fourth with a
value of .S3,988,404; Oregon is fifth
with a vahie of .3,^00,640, and Utah
is sixth with a < 'up of $3.3 9 4.(»72.
The total value of Ire wool grown
the United States ii 1915 was s</ -
was $67,771,954.
A striking evidence of the in
creased prosperity which has come
to western wool growers is shown in
the comparative prices given in this
bulletin. In this bulletin, the aver
age price of Montana scoured wool in
1913 was 47 cents per pound, in 1914
it increased to 57 cents per pound, and
in 1915 to 67 cents per pound.
YOUNG HOMESTEADER KILLED.,
Bert Van Camp, a bachelor home
steader near Crowley in Prairie coun
ty, was found murdered in his claim
shack last week.
It is generally suspected through
out that part of the country that the
assailant was one Melvin Van Sant,
a young farm hand, aged about 25
years, who was living on the home
stead of his brother, Alexander Van
Sant, at the time and who had prev
iously been in the employ of the mur
dered man. The motive, of course, is
not known, although it is thought to
have been robbery, because of the
fact that \ an Camp was known to
have recently sold a team of horses
to a neighbor for which' he received
a large sum of money in cash.
A warrant has been issued for Van
Sant's arrest and all county officials
in the state have been asked to look
for the suspected man.
A broken rifle stock was found at
the scene of the murder, upon one
edge of which a number of short
strands of hair could be seen.
HALLOWELL CONCERT TONIGHT
The Hallowell Concert company, a
musical organization that has made «
reputation for itself wherever they
have appeared, will present their
program at the Orpheum theatre to
night.
In speaking of this company, the
Helena Independent says:
"The Hallowell company is the
finest musical company that comes
to this city Many excellent numbers
were given by the company and
ty applause was given by the audi
ence throughout. Walter Wentzel
was the hit of the evening. Both|^
popular and classical numbers were
given, which pleased all classes
people "

"Business is good," says Sam
Grossman, of the Grossman Motor
company. "In fact, it is so good, and
our business has grown so during,
the past year that oui- present quart-!
ers are far too small."
The demand for more space in the
Grossman garage has become serious
and to remedy it a deal was made
this week for the purchase of two
!()ts adjoining the garage on the
east and an addition will be built on
them. When completed, the garage
will have a 60-foot front and will
furnish ample storage room. The
addition «ill be directly connected
with the main garage and will b
used mainly for storing cars.
OIL MEETING.
A general meeting of the stockhold
ers of the Glasgow Oil and Gas
company was held at the Commercial
club offices Monday afternoon and
matter« of interest to the company
were discussed. Nothing definite
was done, however, regarding the fu
ture plans of the company.
NEW FREIGHT
DEP0TASSURED
Great Northern Will Make Ex
tensive Improvements.
TO REMODEL OLD DEPOT
Present Station Will be Used Ex
clusively for Passengers—
Plans are Now Ready.
Reliable information was received
here this week that by next summer
Glasgow would have a new freight
house and the present depot would
be completely remodeled and marie
into àn executive passenger depot.
This is in line with a communica
tion received recently by the Com
mercial club from R. Budd, assistant
to the president of the Great North
ern.'in which he stated that the local
freight situation at Glasgow had not
been overlooked, but that the rail
road had plans under consideration
for extended improvements here
w hj c h WO uld be carried out during the
coming summer season.
The above report was verified by
definite word that plans were now in
the hands of the master carpenter
for the erection of a new freight
depot and the remodeling of the
present structure.
The new freight depot, according
to present plans, will be 50x180 feet
iand larpe en ° u ^ *° handle the enor
™ US ° f^ght which goes
.through this terminal. The exact lo
cation has not been decided on as
y e ^ but jt will probably go west of
the present depot. Nothing definite
was said about the removal of the
house track, but it will undoubtedly
be taken out and moved down to the
new freight depot.
The present depot will be used ex
clusively for passenger purposes,
and the part now used for a freight
house will be turned into an express
and baggage room. The waiting
rooms will be enlarged and new fix
tures installed throughout.
The announcement that the Great
Northern had decided to make these
improvements comes after a two
year campaign conducted by Secre
tary Moore of the Commercial club,
He has taken up the matter of better
facilities for this point with the rail
roa( i officials from every angle and
to Mr. Moore must go the credit for
securing these new improvements for
the city. Since Mr. Moore took the
office of secretary of the Commercial
he has worked with the Great
Northern officials to better conditions
here, and his efforts have been re
warded when the company has made
improvements that were asked for.
Work on the new freight depot
will probably not begin until in May
or June, but it will be complete.I lie
f 0J .^ "the summer is over
Few people realize the enormous
amount of freight that is handled
through the local office, but when
it. is stated that the present freight
depot is only large enough to han
dle, but a small share of the busi
ness and that most of the freight is
unlja(iod out of stol . afre cars> thcv

Durmg the past few years the re
,pt ® ° f ^ loCal ° fflCC ° f * he Grea î
Northern have increased by leaps and
of!" 8 ' and alth u ° U gh handicaped by
space, the work has always
been handled with precision and dis
patch by the ,ocal afrent ' Joh " J -
iTattan. His record in making Glas
gow one of the best points for the
company along the line is deserving
0 f credit, and it is as much through
his efforts to boost the business of
the company here that Glasgow was
able to secure the new freight de
pot and other improvements.
PRIZES FOR PUPILS.
The Valley County Fair association
is getting out an advance sheet of
premiums for competition among the
"school children of the county for
school work. It contains a list of
P™" ium * to awarded to sch °? 1
h,ldren ^r school work at the Val
ley county lair September 14, 15 and
16. The list is now practically made
up and will be sent to every grade
school in the county the first of the
week, to give them ample time to pre
every department of the. high school
work. There will be prizes for fresh
pare for the fair between now and the
time school is out. The list will be
more comprehensive than last year,
giving the children a wider competi
tive field and includes premiums for
men, sophomores, juniors and seniors,
and with the co-operation of the su
perintendent of schools and principal
of the high school, a greater exhibit
than ever before is expected at this
year's fair.
Secretary Moore stated that only
a few people in the county realized
the great possibilities for develop
ment in all lines of endeavor which
is afforded the school children. This
is especially true in the high school
work. The premium list this year
is made up with the idea of giving
the scholars an opportunity to show
the parents the advantages of a
thorough education.

HAS NARROW ESCAPE.
While cutting ice at the mouth of
Gilbert creek on the Missouri river
last week, Ben Vandeburg, one of the
prominent ranchers in that country,
fell into an air hole and disappeared
under the ice. His companions, Wil
lis Embleton and Pete Tihista made
an effort to reach him before he dis
appe- red, but. they failed. Running to
-a place about thirty feet down the
river, where they had been cutting
ice, Willis Embleton grabbed the big
ice saw and, watching for the body
as it came floating by, hooked it with
the saw, and with the aid of Tihista
got it upon the ice. Their efforts to
revive Vandeburg were successful
and but for a few bruises, he is ap
parently none the worse off for his
experience.

MARRIAGE LICENSES.

PRIMARY LAW
EXPLAINED
Presidential Primary Will be
Held April 21.
SEVERAL NEW RULINGS
Candidates for Electors are Re
quired to Secure Certain
Number of Signatures.
With the primary question settled
by the state supreme court, already
candidates for the nomination for
presidential electors at the April pri
mary are looming up and several have
been mentioned as delegates to the
national conventions of the different
political parties.
In the past, under the convention
system, it has been the custom for
the party in power to elect the gov
ernor, the two congressmen and the
two United States senators as dele
gates to the national conventions, but
under the primary system, anyone
can become a candidate for the of
fice, and whether the custom hith
erto followed will be adhered to this
year, remains a question.
For the purpose of providing in
formation to those who contemplate
being candidates for various offices
at the presidential preference pri
mary and to the end that petitions
for nomination and other things inci
dent to the primary nominating elec
tion to be held April 21, may be uni
form, Secretary of State A. M. Alder
son has deemed it wise to issue the
certain instructions and suggestions
to candidates and officers charged
with the enforcement of the primary
law.
The law provides that all petitions
of candidates for electors and dele
gates must be filed in his office by
April 1, the primary being April 21.
Complete petitions for nomination
must be filed in order to entitle can
didates to a place on the ballot.
Candidates for electors are required
to secure the signatures of one per
cent of the vote for congressman re
ceiving the highest number of votes
at the previous election. The law
makes no provision as to where these
signatures must be secured, whether
all in one county or in several coun
ties.'" Not over 500 signaturesare rë
quired.
With reference to the choice of the
people for president, the law reads
that the personal supporters of a can
didate for president may place a pres
idential candidate in nomination, but
upon the question of how many sup
porters are necessary, the law is
silent. Mr. Alderson has made it
known that he would hold that only
two were necessary.
While the presidential primary law
states in terms that an elector may
vote for only one candidate for dele
gate to national conventions, aru '|
only one candidate for presidential
elector, the attorney general has held
: that this language means that he may
vote for one candidate for each of
fice to be filled. There being four
presidential electors to be chosen
and eight delegates to national con-.
ventions, each elector would be en-1
titled to register his preference to
four and eight respectively.
With reference to the expenses of
delegates to the national conventions,
the law provides that each delegate
may have $200 expense money, but
the legislature last winter neglected
to pass an appropriation to cover
j such expenses and it is presumed that
I delegates will be forced to foot their
own bills.
STATE SCHOOL FUNDS.
State Superintendent 11. A. Devee
I has announced the state apportion
ment by counties of the common
j school fund, which, for 1916, amounts
to a total of $712,645.50, and which
means that the interest on the invest
ment of the public school fund accu
mulated from the sale of state lands,
allows each child $5.25 toward his
education.
The statement of Mr. Davee shows
the largest per capita apportionment
in the history of the state and re
veals the fact that in spite of the!
rapidly increasing number of school
children, the public school fund is
growing faster than the population.:
In 1911, for instance, the per
capita apportionment was only $3.!
A year later it had increased to $3.50,1
and in 1913 it was $4. In 1914 it had,
jumped to $4.50; in 1915 it was $6,
and this year it will be $5.25. The
total number of school children in
Montana has a population of close to
600,000 people.
Silverbow county with 14,140 school
children receives the largest amount
of the public school fund, $74,235;
Cascade second with $47,318.25; Fer
gus third with $40,020.75; Yellow
stone fourth with $34,219.50; Mis
soula fifth with $31,290; Flathead
sixth with $29,235; Carbon seventh
with $25,782.75; Lewis and Clark
dropped to eighth place, her share of
the fund being $25,735.50. Here is

GETS SECOND DEGREE.
Guilty of murder in the fcecond de
gree was the verdict returned by the
^ apainst Joe Reisei ' for the kiU
u; n — ~—*.. —. ta ,
ing of his partner, Joe Fink, Decem
ber 23, in a lonely cabin near Sales
ville. The Bozeman jury was out IS
hours. The finding of Fink's muti
lated body, the tracing of Reiser and
his interception at Dickinson, North
Dakota, and his story of the fight
with an axe and shotgun as weapons
have kept interest in the crime at
high pitch. Reiser pleaded self-de
fense.
OIL LANDS WITHDRAWN,
xhe discovery of natural gas in the
territory adjacent to Havre, and in
'| other points in Montana, together
w jth strong possibility that oil will
| jj e f 0 und in this and other fields, has
j resulted in the withdrawal of about
j 500,000 acres of public land in the
Treasure state from entry. News of
this withdrawal is contained in the
following dispatch sent out from the
national capital and published in the
p a p(.j- s the early part of the week,
"Secretary Lane announces that at
tention has been paid to oil lands,
greater interest in thé oil
situation in Montana. This interest
was stimulated by discovery of large
g. as V vells near Havre and Glendive.
Conditions similar to those in Big
Horn basin of Wyoming may extend"
northward into Montana, it is said,
The attention of the department
having been brought to the existence
of favorable structures in Montana,
about 500,000 acres in this state
have been withdrawn from entry, and
85,000 acres in western North Dakota
on the extension of the Glendive
J structure. These temporary with
drawals have been made to include
the favorable structures at present
known until congress passes legisla
tion similar to that under considéra -
tion, by which it provides for the dis
; position of oil and gas in public lands
under more favorable legal conditions
j than those now prevailing."
More than 184,000 acres of prob»
able coal lands in Montana have alfeo
been placed in reserve.
During January seven orders of
\ designation were approved by Secré
tary of Interior Lane, classifying, as
non-irrigable lands more than 1,*/
800,000 acres of land in Montana,
j California,, Idaho and South Dakota,
These lands now be acquired in
enlarged homesteads, ef 160 acres.
