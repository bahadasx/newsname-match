LINDBERGH SAYS MOMFY UD'
CONGRESSMAN DISCLAIMS IN
TENT TO ASK REPEAL OF
INDIAN TREATY
Minneapolis Journal (1): Congress
man C. A. Lindbergh did not mean to
favor repeal of the Indian treaty
"lid" provision in a former statement
on that question, he declares in a let
ter made public in Washington today.
It is addressed to J. J. Opsahl of Be
midji, who wrote criticising Mr. Lind
bergh's position. Mr. Lindbergh now
says he used the word repeal'' in
haste, when he should have said "mo
dify." "The treaty," he informs Mr.
Opsahl, "was a contract and congress
cannot be expected to repeal what
amounts to a spirit of the contract. No
•bill should be offered that would so
modify the treaty as to admit saloons
or the manufacture of liquor. I am
where- arid was elected with th$t une*.
derstanding:" 'tP"
The-counties ih'"the* treaty''ferfttSi^V
he contends, ought to vote diy under
the state county option law, so it
would not be necessary to have fed
eral authorities keep liquor out.
Mr. Lindbergh again refuses to set
at rest rumors that he will run for re
election to congress or for United
States senator. The "special ^privi
lege interests," he says, fear he will
run for the senate. "I did not ex
pect," he says, "to worry them with
my candidacy this year, but when I
do voluntarily retire from the field it
will not be at a time when I am under
fire."
PASSED AWAY AT 97
Brainerd Dispatch (25): James
O 'Brien, age 97, father of Con O 'Brien
and P. D. O'Brien of this city, passed
away today at his home in Berlin,
Wis. Con O'Brien was on his way to
St. Paul this morning on a business
trip and was wired at Anoka, the mes
sage to be delivered to him on the
train.
N
James O'Brien was widely known in
the community where he lived. He
leaves three sons, Con O'Brien and P.
D. O'Brien of Brainerd and James
O'Brien of Berlin three daughters,
Mrs. James Burns of Berlin, Mrs.
Wilder of Minneapolis and Mrs. Kate
Green of Ripon, Wis.
In his early days Mr. O'Brien was
a stone mason and his sturdy frame
and exemplary habits contributed to
round out the many years of his life.
It was his earnest desire and the wish
of all his friends that he might be
spared to complete 100 years, but
death intervened. He had been sick
& month ago and his children visited
him at the time.
Three dances are scheduled for this
evening, one at the Elks hall, one at
the Odd Fellows hall and one at the
Maurin hall.
I wish to announce that I am en
gaged as midwife in this city, holding
diploma and state license, and can
handle any case. When in need of

Tuesday was the last day on wLich.
to pay the personal taxes without pay
ing an additional penalty of ten per
cent and the county treasurer was
kept very busy. He kept his office
open from 7 to 10 p. m. in order tri
give all who had not paid their taxes
a chance to evade the penalty. The
state examiner requires that the law
in regard to the payment of the per
sonal taxes be enforced to the letter
and therefore the penalty went into
effect on March 1.

tt. J. HAGBERG OF PARKERTOWN
SPEAKS HIGHLY OF LABOR
SAVING DEVICE
C. J. Hagberg of Parkertown is the
first farmer in Morrison county to in
stall a milking machine on his farm
and he now is a great booster for this
labor-saving device.
Every morning arid evening ttorenty
two cows on Mr. Hagberg's farm are
milked with this machine, which was
installed the first of January. The.
machine is operated by a two and one
half horse power gasoline engine,
which is connected with an air com
pressor. Pipes lead from this com
pressor to each stall in the barn and
faucets are fitted on the pipes, to
which the milking machine is coniiect-
The milking machine proper is the
double unit kind, equipped to milk two
cows at once. It works smoothly and
almost noiselessly and the cows give
the operator no trouble whatever. Mr.
Hagberg states that it takes only fr^m
6 to 8 minutes to milk two cows with
this machine, whereas by hand it
takes from twenty to twenty-five min
utes. One man can milk as many cows
with this machine as three men can by
hand, lie says. It is also perfectly
sanitary. The container into which
the milk flows is covered and the cover
is held firmly in place by the com
pressed air suction, so that a long as
the machine is connected to the pipes
and the engine is pumping air it is
impossible to spill the contents or to
remove the cover.
Mr. Hagberg is well pleased with
the work done by the machine and
considers it a money as well as labor
saving device. The total investment
is about $350, including the engine
and pipes.
FISHING SEASON CLOSED

WANT SCHOOL CONSOLIDATED
DISTRICTS 22, 48, 51, 61, 95 and 101
MAY BUILD SCHOOL HOUSE
AT UPSALa
An effort is being made to have the
school districts in the vicinity of Up
sala consolidated into one district and
to have a consolidated school building
erected at that place. County Super
intendent M. E. Barnes ard Rural
School Commissioner Swain of St.
Paul are in Upsala this week, holding
meetings each day to get the people
lined up for this proposition.
The plan is to have all the districts
within a certain radius of Upsala, in
cluding districts 22, 48, 51, 61, 95
and 101, consolidate and erect a large
school in Upsala, where regular grade
work will be taught, as well as high
school work. The taxable value of the
districts is over $270,000 and if the
matter carries a model school house
will no doubt be put up. Mr. Barnes
and Mr. Swain expect to finish hold*
ing their meetings tonight and if the
people generally are then in favor of
the proposition, a petition will likely
be circulated, asking that it be put to
a vote.
