their 1916 clip at tb present time.
In a letter received her by Senator J.
N. Burs-ess. of Pilot Rock, who ia tb
Oregon member of the executive com
mittee of the association, from Secre
tary & W. McClur. be y:
'My advice is that around 6,000,000
pound of inter-mountain wool ha now
been contracted. Fin wool is selling
at from two to thro cents abov
vear'a. with cross breeds at from two
to flv cent above last year.
On Monday several crossbred clips

it is reported that tb Wood Livestock
company' clip ha sold at su cents,
and also that 80 cents ba been offered
for some quater-blood clip in Western

Highway commission are not like th

The question waa put to the attorney
general by the commission, which de
sires to change the route of a state
road in Washington county, it being
found that another route ia more
suitable. John H. Albert, of tba ad

tended that the commission had no au
thority to revise the general system of

state.
