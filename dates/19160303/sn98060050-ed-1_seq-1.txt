KEPT US OUT OF WAR.
Frank L. Greene, member of Con
gress from the first district of Vcr
niont, always a facile and virile writ
er when he presided over the editorial
page of the St. Albans Messenger, con
tributes one of the leading articles to
the first number of Prosperity, the Re
publican national magazine of which
1). II. Lamberton, formerly of the Mor-
risville Messenger, is editor. The sub
ject of Mr. Greene's article is How
President Wilson lias Kept Fs Out Of
War, und lie takes the Democratic slo
gun "Thank God for Wilson! He has
kept us out of war!" as his tex
His arraignment of tho administration
for the complete failure of its econom
ic policy forms the first part of the
article. He shows how tho Democrnts
inherited n surplus of $1133,000,000 and
that today tho government i3
"broke." Taking up the war s'.de he
thinks we have kept out of tho wur,
not because of what Mr. W'ilson has
done, but because none of the Euro
pean nations have wanted us to come
in. Continuing on this line Mr. Greene
says: " Kvery pertinent lesson of his
tory tells us that, if the European
nations to which President Wilson has
despatched notes of protest over vio
lations of our rights lind not been too
litiuL- wltlt innrn ?rnaairr nlYntrj nt
I home, they would have given far more
serious attention to his repeated dc-
llanccs. Even as 'it is, they, do no;, nc
knowlcdgo or concedo tho justico of
. his protests, gcnernlly speaking, but
simply declino to accept his implied
dare to fight because they have fight
iug enough on hand already. This is
not being kept out of the wnr by Mr.
U ilsou, it is being denied a chance to
got in."
In Mexico, as Mr. Greeno points out,
we actually intervened with force and
arms, but Mexico was incapnble of ef
fective resistance. She will, howevtr,
nurse the odious memory of the deed
for generations to come. "Even
'watchful waiting' lost its temper once
and actually made war on Mexico. For
the remainder of the ttme it has stood
by supinely and permitted Mexicans
to make worse than wnr unon thou-
' sands of helpless American men, wo
men and children, within tho er
sight of our country's Hag and appeal
ing dnily in vain for protection.'
"Enlly helpless Mexico? Yes. Actu
ally intervene in Mexico with torce
and arms and keep out of war."
"Threaten mighty Europe, too busy
with other wars to accept our dare
and keep out of war."
" 'God bless Wilson. Ho has kept
us out of wnr.' "
Don't say "my vote won't count,
anyway."
Stand up nnd be counted, according
to your convictions.
If party platforms mean anything
the statu primary will be adopted by
a large majority.
Remember that wo tiro to voto up
on local option or prohibition for the
state as a permanent policy, and
whether licenses shall bo granted in
our own town.
The estimate that 2,000,000 men on
both sides hnvo been killed by no
means covers tho death horror of the
war. "More than .r00,000 children
have perished for lack of nourishment
iu tho fighting countrlos," says Judge
Ben Lindsey. "In boiiio parts of Po
land, practically all children under six
yenrs have died, and all through that
country few children of threo years or
under uro still alive."
Judgo Z. H, Allbea Has Hemorrhages.
Judge Ziun H. Allbee of Bellows
Falls, long a judge of probnto for tho
Westminster district of Windham
county, is seriously ill in his home. Ho
was nt his offico InBt Friday, whon
some attorneys from Brattleboro went
thoro to seo him, but on Saturday,
Sunday and Monday ho was confined
to his honfc, On Tuesday ho was nt

fered attacks of homorrhnso.
THE MAIN QUESTION.
It docs not seem to us to bo neces
sary to go into an extended discus
sion of nil tho pros and cons of tho
subject in order to help tho voters of
our Windham county community to de
cide how their votes shall be. cast on
tho question of state-wide prohibition
as against local option. We think it
is not even desirable to do so, for all
such discussion only tends to obscure
tho main question: What is the best
way for tho people of Vermont to con
trol, or get rid of, tho liquor traffic f
There aro few men or women, who
aro in normnl possession of their mor
al senso, who do not regard tho rum
traffic as a inonnclng evil. Equnlly
few, wo believe, are thoso who do not
look with far greater sympathy and
forbcarnnco on thoso who have fallen
victims to tho liquor habit than on
those who sell them liquor either open
ly or clandestinely. If it were possi
ble, by tho simple enactment of a
law, to wipe out the liquor business in
Vermont onco for all it would bo doiib
by an overwhelming majority, and In
support of such an enactment no line
would bo drawn between prohibition
ists and believers in local option.
Shorn of all quibbles nnd fine points
of argument, our real home question is
whether conditions in Windham coun
ty have been better, or worse, under
tho past 13 years of local option than
they were under the 13, or twice 13
years of supposed prohibition. There
are a large number of our younger
men voters now in their twenties and
some in their thirties who do not re
call, or know, as those who aro n lit
tle older do, what the actual conditions
wero in all the later years of the pro
hibitory law. They do not know un
der what cover of deceit and fraud and
corruption the salo of liquor was car
ried on too often with the evident
knowledge of those whoso duty it was
to enforce the law. It is humiliating
to remember how hotels, for an illus
tration, were owned and run, or leased,
in which liquor was sold with hardlv a
pretence of concealment, and where, if
raids and fines became too frequent and
exponsivc, convenient changes of pre
tended ownership allowed tho business.
to continue in the same old way. And
there were other conditions equally
bad,- -The worst of it.wtur that too of
ten such a state of things came to be
taken for granted, with its inevitable
effect on the moral sense of the com
munity, and especially on the young.
While it may not be maintained that
tho operation of the local-option law
lias been perfect and ideal, is it not
true that under it, here in Windham
county, the community moral sense,
and feeling of moral responsibility,
have been awnkencd and kept awake,
and that conditions have become far
better than they have ever been under
prohibition? And has not tho deter
mining influence been the fact that the
question has been put "up to" every
voter once every year?
We began in 1903 in a sort of " Hur
rah! Now - we 'II - be up-to-the-timea '
break-away with six Windham county
towns voting for license, or eight if wo
include in these figures Somerset nud
Stratton, which for obvious reasons
have never taken out licenses. In 1904
the number of licensed towns was the
same nnd then tho commonsenso of
our people asserted itself and the hur
rah died out. Even the most ar
dent advocates of license didn't like
what the saloons brought with them,
nnd today Windham county is, as it
hns been for tho past three years, prac
tically a prohibition county, for the
yes vote of a town like Somerset, as
already intimated, doesn't count in nn
estimate like this.
There is no occasion for heat or ac
cusation by either side on this issue,
becnuso earnest and sincere advocates
on both sides havo the same end in
view the elimination or control of tho
liquor traffic to tho greatest extent pos
sible. It is just n straight question of
means to an end. We do not doubt
tho entire sincerity of the advocates of
state-wide prohibition. But we think
they overlook tho fact thnt it is n con
dition nnd not a theory which wo
havo to deal with; thnt unconsciously
they put tho emplinsls on tho name of
tho weapon which thoy purposo to use
and not on the end which they hopo
to gnin.
The essential argument for the Per
ry law is that its endorsement by ref
erendum vote will simply make tho
no-liconso feature of our present Inw
stato-wldo and Imperative. Our ob
jection is thnt wo do not bolievo it
would do this in its practical and ulti
mate effect.
Looking back to .conditions before
1902, wo boliovo that cutting out tho
local-option fenturo would mean cutting
out tho vital part of tho lnw. Tho
sonso of individual responsibility
would bo gone. Once more what is ov
rybody's business would bo nobody 'n
business, and wo ifhould, have hack the
old scandals of evasion, deception, open
defiance and falluro to enforce What
it finally comes to is the question
whether ench voter wants to keop Ills
own share of the responsibility in his
own hands, or whether he prefers to
shoulder it off on to an impersonal of
ficialism. It doesn't answer at nil to say thai
those who tnko this view aro rummiea
or friends of the liquor interest, be
cause it is true that not a few out
spoken and consistent tempcrnnco men
freely acknowledge that they hnvo
become converted to the principle of
local option by watching Its operation
in our home community.
Wo havo here spoken only of tha
sentiment and results in Windham
county, but recalling tho fact that tho
state began in 1903 with 92 iuv.'PS in
tho license column, and that in 1903 tho
number dropped to 35, while now thero
are but 14 not counting Somerset and
the live other licenseless yes towns
it seems safe to infer that our local
conditions arc typical of those through
out the state.
WILL NOT REDUCE RATES.
Public Service Commission Dismisses
Petition Against Bellows Falls &
Saxtons River Street R. R.
The public service commission of
A'crinont, of which Robert C. Bacon of
Brattleboro is chairman, hns just
issued its order in the petition of cer
tain freeholders of Rockingham
against the Bellows Falls & Saxtona
River Street Railway Co. The peti
tion, which objected "to the schedule of
rates for freight and express filed
Sept. 25, 1913, to become operatlvo
Oct. 23, 1915, stated that the new
schedule was a material increase, un
reasonable, unjust, excessive nnd dis
criminatory. It asked that the com
mission, after a hearing, prescribo just
nnd reasonable rates, but the ordor
dismisses the petition. The order
shows that the companv's capital
stock is $100,000, that its' funded In
debtedness is $73,000 and that it has
outstanding loans and notes pnvablo
of .G9,000.
"As the revenues of tho petitionee,
to speak mildly, aro now no more thnn.
adequate," the commission asserts,
we are not disposed to disturb these
rates." In closing, the order says:
"Xo method of offsetting the reduc
tion in the petitionee's revenue which
would necessarily follow any reduction
in rates was suggested by the peti
tioners. With conditions as shqwn, tho
petitionee s-hould nbt,bn compelled to
stand n reduction of revenue. Wo con
clude that tho petition should be dis
missed and it is so ordered."
THE WAR SITUATION.
Interest Centers cn Gorman Offensive
at Verdun Still a Tensa reeling la
Washington.
The war situation has ppntprpd fiil
week around tho treninmimw ilmmnn
attack at Verduu, evidently considered
the most vulnerable point in tho route
to Paris, but 100 miles away from
the French capital. The Germans havo
unmistakably made gains there, but
probably at n terrible sacrifice, and
the main part of the stronghold is still
iu possession of the French. Xt. U
claimed at Paris that the German cas
ualties in the recent offensive amounted
to 125,000 to 150,00 men, but the Ger
man statement is to the effect that tho
losses are slight.
The situation at Washington has re
mained tense. Little progress has been
made on the situation with Germany.
President Wilson insists that neutrals
have a right to be safeguarded at sea
oven though they travel on merchant
vessels armed for defensive purpose3
only. He has thrown down the gaunt
let and it is expected a vote will be
taken shortly on u resolution warning
Americans off armed ships of bellige
rents. HEARD ACROSS CONTINENT.
