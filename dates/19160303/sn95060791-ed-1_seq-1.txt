The State Herald, published
weekly in Phoenix, has been con
ducting a systematic inquiry a-
(mong: republicans throughout
i the state as to their preference
year ago today, for nominees for the various
in state officers. As a result the
claims the following
A Year in Holbrook

Holbrook and comDleted thelHerald3
purchase of The Holbrook nd Persons have been select
News. During the 12 months
which has elapsed since that
date we have increased the
business of the paper and
have improved the equip
ment of the plant. The ad
vertising patronage is larger
than it was when we took
over the business; another
job press has been installed
in the plant, and a cylinder
newspaper press has been
purchased and is now in
transit. It should reach Hol
brook in a few days.
While we have increased
the business and have added
to the value of the plant,
our task has not been an
easy one. We have worked
hard during the past, year,
but the satisfaction of hav
ing gone forward of having
improved upon the work of
our predecessors is suffici
ent reward for any discom
forts we may have experienc
ed. We appreciate the loyal
support that has been given
us by the people of Navajo
county, and we thank them
for it. We have found this
one of the best communities
in which we have ever lived.
The people have been good
to us and to the enterprise
which we represent. That
ovir lot has been cast among
them shall ever be cause for
our own rejoicing.
The Holbrook News is not
the only institution which
has prospered. The past
year has been a prosperous
one for every business in
Holbrook and, we believe,
for every one in the county.
All have enjoyed a healthy
increase in the volume of
business done, and all have
increased their facilities for
doing business in the coming
years. All of which is evi
dence that the people here
are alive to their advantages
and are allowing nothing
that would benefit them to
escape them.
We believe that the next
12 months will witness
greater improvement in Hol
brook and the county than
the last 12 months have, wit
nessed. Before that length
of time has elapsed, Hol
brook will have larger and
better school facilities, the
town will be incorporated and
sidewalks and sewers will be
built, and the population will
be more than double what it
is today.
The News will endeavor to
keep pace with the general
advancement in the commu
nity. As the field becomes
enlarged and our acquaint
ance wider, we sha J 1 try to
increase both the circulation
of the paper and the desire
of the public for the paper.
This we can do with the
cooperation of the people,
ano: this cooperation we
cordially invite.

New Daily Newspaper
The Mohave County Miner,

nounces that it will begin

have the associated press
service, and will aim to cover
the world in its news f eat:
ures.
The publication of a daily
newspaper in a town the size
of Kingman is a hazardous
undertaking; doubly so when
the publisher already has a
weekly that covers the field;
is making money, and which
will probably die with the
advent of its daily competit
or. '
However, Mr. Smith, the
owner, has probably accumu
lated sufficient wealth from
his weekly to be able to af
ford the luxury of a daily if
he so desires. Anyhow, he

County Engineer

north of the Wetzler bung
alow court.
Each site has its advant
ages, and each has" ardent
supporters, consequently it
is probable that most of the
people entitled to vote will
go to the poles and register
their preference.
Upon this question The
News is, as Abe Potash
would say, "neuter". We
believe that the question is
one that should be settled by
the people who are patrons
of the school, hence we re
frain from expressing an
opinion. But the columns of
the paper are open to any
persons who desire to use
them for arguments for or
against either site.
Ladies' Aid Society
The Ladies' Aid society will
meet next Wednesday after
noon March 8, at the home
of Mrs. Thorwald Larson.
All members are requested
to attend, and any others in
terested in the work are in

although it doubts the wis

Road contracts up to No.
16-1916 have been published
for bids. These contracts
are for work of several kinds
and located in different parts
of the county.
It is gratifying to be able to
state that road conditions in
nearly all cases are excellent. I
The State road forces have
completed their work for the
present year within this coun
ty and the equipment ship
ped to Kingman.
Relative to the last work
done on the Winslow-to-Hol-brook
road an excellent job
was done all the distance
constructed, and it is regret
able that another mile could
not have been completed
which would have eliminated
the worst piece on the whole
road. The county will place
this in a passable condition
hut the road fund is so slend
er that a subscription for the
purpose would greatly assist
in doing a more permanent
job.
Attendance of the work
men on the county court and
continued high water have
temporarily suspended work
on the bridges.

FKteen attorneys general, including tbe attorney genera! or Arizona,
ave filed in the national supreme court a brief in support of the constitu
onality of the West Virginia law prohibiting the receipt and possession of
ntoxicating liquors, and of the Webb-Kenyon act. which prohibits the ship
ment of liquors into dry states in violation of state laws. It is declared in
'he brief that any state has the power to prohibit the receipt, use or posses
sion of liquor. If states have not that right, it is argued, they have not the
right to prohibit the manufacture of liquor for persona' use.
If the contention of the attorneys general are upheld, there will no
onger be any question of the constitutionality of the proposed law forbidd'ng
the use of liquor in Arizona. Beyond this the state is not affected, accord
ing to Attorney General Wiley Jones.
An order promulgated by the state board of pardons requires thai all
matters for the consideration of that body be presented In writing. No one
is to be permitted to appear before the board herea:'tei except upon invita
tion. The members say that they have been Imposed upon by persons hav
ing no new evidence or facts bearing upon the cases in which they were in
terested. In several instances attorneys have appeared before the board to
argue cases already argued before trie supreme court.
Through tbe operation of the motor vhic'e license law, Secretary of
S'ate Sidney P. Osborn collected $40,714 during the month of January -The
amount collected for auto licenses proper was $39,477.50: motorcycle
tags, $722; chauffeurs' licenses, $4.00; seals and badges, $114. The total Jan
uary receipts of the office were $41,114.75.
That imprisonment pending the payment of a fne Is not the same as
imprisonment for debt was the decision of the supreme court in the case of
George B. Morris. Morris was convicted in the Maricopa county superior
fourt of removing mortgaged property from the state. He was sentenced
to serve thirty days in jail and pay a fine" of $500, with the alternative of
serving an additional day for each dollar of the fine that he d!d not pay.
At the end of the thirty-day period his attorney applied for a writ o' habeas
corpus on the ground that he was being imprisoned for a debt he owed the
Hate. Had this contention been upheld the fami'iar "Seven dollars or
seven days" of the police court would no longer hjtve been heard.
Organization of a National Guard company Is practically completed at
Wins'ow, according to Adjutant General Charles W. Harris. Plans for the
'ormation of companies at O'.arkdale and Jerome are well under way. Each,
company is to have 65 enlisted men and three officers.
An announcement that Harry W. Heap, of Prescott, a member of the
Yavapai county board of supervisors and a successful business man, is a ran
lidate for the republican nomination for governor, Is the most important
olitical development of the week.
Governor Hunt made a trip to W!nslow and addressed several gatherings.
'Tpon his return he was asked if he had announced that he was a candidate
o succeed himself and replied that he "took that for granted."
George A. Olney. who !s opposing Hunt for the gubernatoria" nomina
"on and Treasurer Mitt Simms, who hopes to beat Sidney P. Osborn. incum
nt, for the nomination for secretary of state, are campaigning vigorously
nd c'a'm that they are receiving encouraging oromises of support.
Nf.ar'y seventy delegates were present st the e'eventli annual child vel
are conference of the Arizona Congress of Mothers, held in Phoenix. Oral
nd written reports presented there showed the parent-teachers assoc'ations
hroughout the state to be in flourishing condition. The following of"ir-g

Kansas City cattle dealers are looking to the Salt River and other Arizona
alleys to relieve, at least partla'ly. the shortage of fat cattle which nrva''s
n that market durine May and June of each year. Prices then are a1 ways
ilgher than at any other season. Railroad men are expecting heavy "move
nents of stock from Arizona points to Kansas Cty during those monhs of
Ms year. Until a few months ago Arizona feeders were paying little at
'ention to the Kansas City market.
At the request of Parker merchants the corporation commission tins
ecured a readjustment of rates on hay shipped from Paker to northern
rlzona and Nevada, placing Parker on a parity with Salt River va'ley points
Until 'ast year most of the hay used 'a the Parker section was imoortd
from Phoenix, but the ranchers of the Colorado valley are now raising more
!han enough alfalfa for the bome market and large .shipments will be made
o the northern mining camps this year.
Notification of a material advance In the rates on zinc ores from Mohave
ounty to Colorado points has been received by the corporation commission.
It 'b probable that the interstate commerce commission will be asked to sus
pend and Investigate the advance.
That a pub'ic service corporation has the right to discontinue se-vice to
i customer who, It has reason to believe, is resorting to fraud to reduce bis
bills, is the decision reached by the commission n a Phoenix case. The
decision sets an important precedent.
State Game Warden G. M. Willard has shipped several dozen quail and
a cobpful of Arizona jaskrabb'.ts to the game warden of Ohio, who plans to
Dropagate them and thus Increase the game supply of that state. The
Arizona warden Is not quite sure that the oropaeatlon of jackrabbis is des'r
able but Ohio sportsmen think they should make good shooting. In re
turn the Ohio warden will send a number oí Bob Whites for liberation, at
some point In Arizona.
The house committee on appropriations has refused to recommend an
appropriation of $20,000 out of the nat'onal treasury for the repair of the
Roosevelt highway, which was badly damaged in the January floods. Chair
man John J. Fitzgerald has written Congressman Carl Hayden that to do so
would set a dangerous precedent, as demands would then pour in for appro
priations for other scenic highways throughout the country. He says that
the fact that the Roosevelt road lies most'y in a national forest does not pre
c'ude state or county funds being expended to put it In shape.
s For the first time in history, much of the Salt River valley's orange crop
was marketed right In the state. In the course of the season that has just
closed the Arizona Orange association shipped seven carloads to Bisbee and
