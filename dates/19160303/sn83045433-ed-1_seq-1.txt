Disclosure of Truth May Cause Even

to Rise iq Protest.
By JOSEPH P. ANNIN.
The disclosure of the real facts in con
nection with the Missouri River Improve
ment project threatens to develop into a
"pork barrel" expose which even the con
stituencies directly benefited by the plan
will repudiate.
The erds to which Representative Will
lam P. Borland-the same Mr. Borland
who proposes to Increase hours of labor
in the government departments in order
to "save" the "pee-puls'" money-and
his associates have gone in order to force
his pet project through are hardly rivaled
in American history.
A competent and conscientious army en
gineer had reported adversely on the con
tinuation of a Project which proposed an
Initial expenditure of 6.000,000 and an
nual fixed charges of $1.100.00.
Representative Borland not only pro
cured the reversal, without cause, of this
report by the board of army engineers in
Washington. and the removal of Col.
Deakyne to another position. but through
some strange delay, this adverse report
has never reached Congress. despite re
peated demands made upon the War De
partment.
Item in New Measure.
The first tangible result of that delay
Is seen in the fact that the new river and
harbor bill contains an item of $1.75D.010
for this project, slipped into the bill while
the damagling and conclusive report of
,t,.i. Deakvne was lid under cover lest
it spoil the well-laid plans of the Kansas
lIty protector of the "pee-puls' ' money.
The report of Col. Deakyne was dated
April 1-. 191. -The report of- she board
of army engineer. which reversed Col.
Deak ,ne, under the tremendous politl
cAl pressire -trou:ht -to bear 'by - Rep
resentative Borland and his friends on
the Missouri delegation, was concluded
ea- y IPst Pedeil er-'before ' the 'hvtr
And Harbor Committee commenced writ
ing the onnihus ,ill.
Repeated demands were mide 'by mer
bers of Congress for the Deakyne report
In order that they might have all the
falts in connection with this tremendous
project. Representative Frear. of Wis
-on-in. the leading protagonist In the
lilose o, river and harbor work. de
manded it for use In preparing his ml
otny report. But It was safely pigeon
holed in the office of the chief of engi
neere. where it would do the least dam
tge to the projected raid on the Treas
u ry.
Report Not Available.
Even now the report is not available
for members of Congress. though it prob
bly wVt be a fw days. It is being printed
at the Government Printing Office. Com
menticng on this fact in a speech in the
Iouse. Representative Frear asked:
"Where is the Deakyne report. reject
in; the Missouri rIver project? Several
millon war-tax-burdened people not in
cluded in the State census are 'from Mis
souri' and want to be shown just why
r)eakyne was removed and why his re
port has been delayed or suppressed.
Deakyre tried to protect the government
Treaur'. Why not make him chief en

"What influence caused Chief Kingman
to banish Col .Deakyne. whose offlcial
reports disclosed that the government
is spending $2'0.t20.000 for revetting and
teclaiming private land on the Missouri?"
And yet Mr. Borland. the principal
proponent of this project. blandly asked
In the House last Monday:
"Can Congress defend the placing of
taxes upon the farmers and business men

'TALK OF WAR
STIRS WRATH
U. S. Officials Indignant Over
Assertions that Wilson's
Policy Means Strife.
GERMANY OF OPINION THAT
PRESIDENT IS UNSUPPORTED
Believed Here that Teutons Are Striv
ing to Arouse Greater Sentiment
Against Wilson's Stand.
Growing indignation is felt in State De
partment circles over what is regarded
as an organized propaganda, directed not
only from German centers in thin coun
try but from the foreign office in Berlin.
to scare the American Congress and the
people of this country into the belief that
President Wilson's course In the handling
of the submarine issue is leading to war.
To the same extent officials resentl
strongly reports being spread broadcast
in Berlin, and being printed in Berlin
newspapers as though based on reports
being received from Washington by the
German foreign office that congress Is
lined up anywhere from two to one to
five to one against the President's in
sistence on the right of Americans to
travel en British merehant vessels armed
for defense.
Information cencerning these Berlin
reports was contained in a lengthy cable
gram _resived 4t the State Department
yesterday afternoon from United States
Ambassador Gerard. who declared that
the impression existed strongly in the
German capital, in official circles as well
as on the streets, that the President has
the backing neither of Congress nor the
country.
Esabasay Deales eina- Source.
The -German Embassy dealed last night
that any reports concerning the opposi
tion to the President in Congress had
been sent to Berlin by the Ambassador.
It was remarked in German quarters
i -c. however, that the Berlin newspa
f1 had doubtless received full reports
of the statements printed in this country
concerning Speaker Clark's observations
to the President. when he informed the
Chief Executive that the House would
vote at least two to one against him.
American offeals regard as significant
the persistent reports from Germany.
printed in certain American newspapers,
that the German government is con
vinced that the United States is prepar
ing to sever relations with Germany, and
that Germany Is preparing for such an
outcome to the negotiations. It is sus
pected that these stories are being in-i
spired with the sole view of frighteningi
the American people into forcing Presi
dent Wilson to acquiesce in Germany's
contentions.
GERMAN LOSSES NOT

Teuton Correspondents at Front Com

of Tidal Waves.
Special Cabe to The Wshington Herat.i*
Berlin, (via Sayville) March Z--A state
ment issued today by the Trans-Ocenn
News Bureau quotes the German corres
pondents at the front as summarizing the
situation at Verdun as follows:
Between February 21 and March I the
Germans gained 1.170 square kilometers
(457 square miles) of terrain, which is
about four times as much as the French
gained in their whole offensive in Cham
pagne last autumn.
"The German tactics have persistently
avoided the posbilities of great human,
losses: therefore they avoided direct
storming and replsced it by constant col-~
laboration of all arms. The result has
been that the whole advance consisted
of a series of tidal waves, each of which,
during the last few days brought gains.'"

MANY WHITE HOUSE PARLEYS
Wilson Gives Out Statement Denying
Saying U. S. Might End War by
Break with Germany.
The reply of the Senate to President
Wilson's demand for a vote on the
armed merchantman question will be
given today.
After a day of turmoil, Senate lead
ers agreed to bring up the Gore reso
lution when the Senate meets this
morning, and obtain a vote at once.
The resolution warns Americans
against traveling on armed vessels of
the belligerent powers.
The vote will not be taken on the
merits of the resolution and in that
respect will fall short of complying
with the Iresident's expressed request.
The understanding last night was
that the Senate would vote on a mo
tion to lay the resolution on the table.
A canvass of the Senate showed that
the motion would be carried by a
large majority.
The decision to take this step fol
lowed a sensational debate in the Sen
ate, and its object is largely to pre
vent a recurrence of the outbreak. A
motion to table a resolution automati
cally cuts off debate.
Gere Stirs Senate.
The most stirring incident of the
day came when Senator Gore. speak
ing in the Senate, made the statement
on "authority which seemed most re
sponsible," "that the President had
told members of the Senate and House
that the United States would aid civi
Ilzation by. 'entering the Euro-I
pean war."
As Senator Gore understood it. the
President said:
"That if Germany insisted upon her
position the United States would in
sist upon her position, and that it
would probably result in a breach of
diplomatic relations. and that a breach
of diplomatic relations would probably
be followed by a state of war and
that a state of war might not be of it
self and of necessity an evil to this
republic, but that the United States
by entering upon war now might be
able to bring it to a conclusion by
midsummer, and thus render a great
service to civilization."
Dental with Reservatiouir.
This brought a denial with reservations
from Senator Stone. chairman of the For
ign Relations Committee, after Senator
3ore had turned to him questioningly.
Senator Gore then asked Senator Kern if
the information was true, but the ma
lority leader sat silent in his chair and
lid not reply.
The White House later issued a denial,
in the following form:
"When the attention of the White House
was called to certain statements in Sen
ator Gore's speech this afternoon, the
President authorized an unqualified denial
if any utterance to which any such mean
ing could be attached."
Notwithstanding the many denials, there
remains the general understanding in offi
ial circles that the White House and
State Department have both received in
timations that a breach of diplomatic re
lations would mean war. This opinion has
been expressed. freely, thoush privately,
in diplomatic circles, for some weeks.
The belief is strong that Secretary Lan
ging has had this pointed out to him by
Count von Bernstorff, the German Am
bassador. The Secretary and Ambassa
]or alike. however. declined to discuss the
subject last night.
Numerous Conferenees.
Next in importance to the situation in
the Senate yesterday were the numerous
,onferences at the White House between
the President and his advisers and Minor
ty Leader Mann, of the House of Repre
sentatives.
The Senate adjourned lag nIght until
11 o'clock this morning, wth an under-I
standing that the Gore resolution wal
to be called up at .once..
A poll of the Senate revealed that the
vote on the motion to table the resolu
tin would be substantially 40 for and 131
a'gainst.

he declared a short time ago to contain
but 'a few bandits."
The Department of Justlee is in re

Germans Threaten
Relief Workers
Well-Known Women of New
York Warned by Teuton
Sympathizers.
Srecial to The Washington Herald.
New York, March 2.-Federal authort
ties are quietly investigating an alleged
campaign on the part of the German
sympathizers to intimidate prominent
women engaged in war relief work -for
the allies.
The investigation came as a result of
threatening letters received by Mrs. S.
Barton French and Mrs. Nina L,1 Dur
yea. Other well-known women have also
received letters of the same sort.
Mrs. French received two letters. She
threw them in the waste basket. But
when she received a mysterious midnight
telephone call from a man of unmistak
able German accent, she said she rea
li$ed the matter was more than a Jokc.
'The man showed by his conversation
over the telephone that he had Intimate
knowledge of my comings and goings,"
said Mrs. French. "He didn't speak like
a erank,- but appeared to be polished
in manner and voice. Unless I gave up!
my relief work I would be tabulated. he
told me. He laid great stress en the
word 'tabulated.' I am at a loss to un
derstand what he means.''
Mrs. Duryea received two letters about
the time that Mrs. French received her'
letters. Soon after this Mrs. Duryea
was stopped on the street by a German,
who persisted in reiterating the threats.
