for the reclamation of state lands,

soil survey.

Barker Gives Talk.
E. A. Barker, president of
Merchants association, called
diners to order shortly after
o'clock and in introducing Judge C.
W. Stanton as toastmaster, stated
that Judge Stanton needed no intro
duction to the association but that
the association needed an introduc
tion to Judge Stanton. He outlined
the work of the association, stating
that efforts were to make Bemidji a
bigger and better town.
"There is always a reason why
any town grows," said Mr. Barker.
"Usually that reason is a little bunch
of men who are in the trenches all
the year around fighting for the ma
terial advancement of the town. They
are always on the watch for better
ing conditions and to bring growth
and prosperity to the town. These
men are progressive. They spend
their time and money for the welfare
of the community. They are sol-
dierS of commercialism and are con
tinually firing volleys of optimism.
For them there is no such word as
'failure.' They refuse to be squelch
ed by reverses but keep on fighting
the good fight. These men are the
men that do things. They are the
men who are really worth while and
their value to a community cannot be
overestimated.
N 2 1s
the the ten
Stanton Toastmaster.
Judge Stanton in assuming the du
ties of toastmaster stated that he had
much confidence in President Barker
and the members of the Merchants
association. He said in part:
"We heartily concede to the busi
ness men that they have succeeded in
making Bemidji the industrial and
commercial center that it is. We
have confidence- in President Barker
and the members of the Merchants
association and we are eager to as
sist and support them In bringing
about that greatness for which we
all believe will be the destiny of
Bemidji."
First Talk Outside.
In introducing Governor Burnquist,
Judge Stanton called attention to the
honor shown Bemidji by the gover
nor's visit, stating that he would de
liver an address for the first time
outside of the capitol city since be
coming chief executive of the state.

Governor B\ nquist At Third Annual Banquet
Of The tNmidji Merchants Association Urges
Formii Of State Park At Head of Lake Bemidji
GOVERNOR OF STATE GUEST OF BEMIDJI
GOVERNOR BURNQUIST
SUGGESTS STATE PARK
AT HEAD OF LAKE
In opening his address Governor
Burnquist referred to the trip
through the northern part of the
state what was known as the "Ad-
journed Legislature" last June, and
spoke of the benefits resulting from
that trip, of the different portions of
the state visited at that time, and the
great enterprises which were seen on
that occasion.
In this connection he mentioned the
beautiful tract of virgin pine that
remains adjoining the city of Be
midji and suggested the consideration
of the advisability of securing the
same for a state park, to show to fu
ture generations the Minnesota for
ests of the past.
Speaks of Bemidji.
He said that one result of that trip
was the calling of an "All-Minne
sota Development Convention" by
the late Governor Hammond, which
was held at the capitol, Dec. 1, 1915.
Governor Burnquist discussed certain
of the propositions which were recom
mended by that convention, such as
the revolving fund amendment, high
way, drainage and the necessity of a
soil survey of the different portions
of the state, and in this connection
explained the recent sale of a portion
of the foreign state bonds held by the
state of Minnesota, the prdceeds of
which can be loaned to different
school districts, municipalities and
counties of the state and at the same
time procure for the state a higher
rate of interest as most of the bonds
have netted only three per cent in
terest.
An Engineer's Survey.
Another matter that the governor
thought should be considered is the
advisability and the practicability of
having an engineer's survey of the
northern portion of the state to de
termine what can be accomplished
along the lines of draining all of the
swamp lands and at the same time
secure co-operation with the federal
government to investigate the feasi
bility of constructing reservoirs to re
tain the water, to be used for navi
gation purposes in the Mississippi
river when the water in that river is
too low for navigation. The prac
ticability of a future canal system
for Minnesota, when the population
has increased so as to warrant the
expenditure of moneys for that pur
pose, as is now done in other states,
such as in the state of New York,
and in foreign countries, as in Ger
many, will eventually have to be con-

state.
Refers to Citizenship.
The governor then spoke of that
which he said was more important,
the progress, learning and education
necessary for the advancement of the.
citizenship within the state, referring
to the diversity in that citizenship,
and the necessity by reason thereof
of education along citizenship lines
and-'OfrnV ruction to secure the prop
er use of the rights of franchise,
which have continually grown in this
country and in this state, until to
day the voters have more power than
they have ever had. He also spoke
of the desirability of the elimination
of any nationality antipathices or
prejudices which may exist by reason
of the diversity in our citizenship,
and in this connection called atten
tion to the impression gained by those
visiting Northern Minnesota during
the legislative trip when it was found
that a score of different nationalities
were represented in the schools, and
all of these, through the education re
ceived, were developing into good,
true and patriotic American citizens.
Practice Lincoln Spirit.
In connection with education he
said that we should also put into
practice the spirit shown by that
greatest product of the Middle West,
who is today considered the Ideal Am
erican citizen, Abraham Lincoln, and
that when it can be shown in this
country that people of so many dif
ferent nationalities can live together
in peace and harmony and prosperity,,
this fact may be of some assistance
in making it possible at some future
time for all peoples to agree upon an
international court for the settlement
of their international differences and
upon a police power to enforce the de
crees of such a court.
MRS. EDUARD F. NETZER
URGES CO-OPERATION
AMONG LOCAL MERCHANTS
Mrs. Eduard F. Netzer in an able
address entitled "Co-operation Among
Merchants," called upon the business
men of Bemidji to co-operate with
one another and to co-operate with
their sales forces.
She said that mail order buying
was just a habit and that merchants
should be able to break this habit by
effective advertising. She called at
tention to the "fine" reading in a
mail order catalogue, which tells ev
erything a person wants to know,
and urged local merchants to make
their advertisements attractive, to
BEMIDJI, MINNESOTA, FRIDAY EVENING, MARCH 3, 1916.
tell the people something and above on publicity for Amendment No. 1,
all something truthful. Besides and we have a plan in mind which
newspaper advertising she urged at
tractive window displays, stating that
if they would catch the eye of a wo
man who did not intend to buy, she
would go in the store and buy any
way.. V^. w:.i..v.
Windows Attract.
"Bright, catchy windows attract
the attention of tourists, also," said
Mrs*. Netzer. "A tourist will remem
ber the appearance of a city whose
stores have attractive windows and
it will mean a big advertisement for
the city."
Mrs. Netzer also urged the use of
indoor show cards and every other
step that could possibly be taken to
make the people realize that the more
sent out of town so much more would
the value of their property decrease
in the town. She urged merchants
to trade at home also, if they desired
other people to trade at home.
"There are five reasons why I trade
at home," said Mrs. Netzer. They
are as follows: .1,
"First, I have my interests here.
"Second, because I believe in trans
acting business with friends.
"Third, because the community
that is good enough for me to live in
is good enough for mp to buy in.
Fourth, because the man I pur
chase from pays hia.part of the city
and county taxes.
"Fifth, because I /believe in my
town and its future.'*
Aid Sales Brace.
Mrs, Netzer urged the merchants
to secure a good sales force and to
co-operate with the force. She urged
the holding of meetings to discuss
the stock and sales ideas. She urged
the merchants to find out the needs
of the customer and satisfy him or
her, stating that it is easier to sell
a second article to a customer that
is satisfied than to sell an article to
a new customer.
ANDY RAHN ASKS
SUPPORT FOR
AMENDMENT NO. 1
A. A. D. Rahn, Minneapolis man,
who is well known in this city, was
introduced by Judge Stanton as "a
citizen at large," who stated that
Mr. Rahn was a candidate for dele
gate at large to the Republican con
vention.
Mr. Rahn outlined the work that
is being done for the adoption of
Amendment No. 1 and said in part.
"Amendment No. 1 is an act pro
posing an amendment to Section 2,
Article 8 of the Constitution of the
state of Minnesota, authorizing the
setting apari:'~o^Tifvo1y^^-!fixiid'
of
not over $250,000 from the school
and swamp land funds to be used in
constructing roads, ditches and fire
breaks in .through and around un
sold school and swamp lands ,and in
clearing such lands.
"If you are not already familiar
with this amendment, you should
look into it very thoroughly as
believe it will be a great benefit to
this portion of the state. North of
us here on the M. & I. railroad, the
state owns great tracts of cut-over
lands that are far better for agricul
tural purposes than for reforesta
tion.
Lack of Roads.
"However, the one great drawback
in the development of this land is
the lack of roads to get to and from
it. This fund will enable the state,
through its commission, to build such
roads, and to clear a certain amount
upon every section of land.
"If this amendment is adopted by
the people of Minnesota these lands
can then be put upon the market with
a nice little cleared area ready for
the settler to go upon and till. He
will not have to face the many hard
ships and overcome the innumerable
obstacles which confront the sturdy
pioneer of today and of yesterday. It
will enable the man with a small
amount of money to settle on this
land, and in the first year raise a
little crop on that portion of his land
which the state has made ready for
the plow. This will leave him free
to devote his spare time to clearing
additional land.
Cost Pro-rated.
"The cost of this splendid work will
be pro-rated among all the lands bene
fitted and added to selling price.
With the low rate of interest and the
number of years allowed to repay
this money, the farmer will be en
abled to pay for his lands and im
provements from products raised as
he goes along.
"I am a member of the committee

will probably get the desired results.
That is to hold tag days in all the
cities throughout the state during
fair time, and let every man contrib

in this manner will be used for the
purpose of getting out slips explain
ing why this amendment should be
adopted. These slips will be sent
throughout the entire state and be

BEMIDJI TO PLAY
BRAINERD TONIGHT
In what is believed will be the most
spirited contest ever seen on a local
floor, the Bemidji high school basket
ball team will play the Brainerd high
school quintet tonight at the Armory.
The Brainerd team arrived in Bemidji
last night. The game tonight will
be called at 8:15 and it is expected
that a record attendance will be pres
ent.
The Brainerd quintet defeated Be
midji at Brainerd by a score of 3$
to 27.
If Bemidji wins tonight it will
result in a tie for the title of the
Sixth district and games on neutral
floors will have to be played. If Be
midji loseswell, that is out of the
question. The Bemidji boys claim
that they will win by a decisive score.

Flames.
The new consolidated school house
at Spur was completely destroyed by
fire yesterday afternoon. The origin
of the fire is not known. The total
loss will be over $12,000.
The janitor of the school shortly
before four o'clock discovered a blaze
in the attic. He attempted to put
the fire out and called for neighbors
to assist. The well at the school
house had not been completed and
there was no water handy with which
to fight the fire. There was no fire
apparatus as the school is located in
a country district.
The school had been closed about
a week on account of an epidemic of
scarlet fever and was being fumi
gated.
The school was completed last fall
and opened for school about Oct. 1.
The cost of the building was about
$9,000.
No arrangements have been made
for the children for the completion
of the school year. The school will
be rebuilt.
FIRE DEPARTMENT
HAS THREE GALLS
The Bemidji fire department has
answered three calls within the past
twenty-four hours. Fires were dis
covered at the E. F. Netzer residence
on Beltrami avenue at six o'clock and
at eight o'clock at the R. McCall
home on America avenue. The scene
o|_ this Morning's blaze was a refrig
erator car oii the"MT Ik. 17""railroad"
tracks near the Union depot.
At six o'clock last evening a small
chimney fire in the rear chimney of
the E. F. Netzer home caused a run.
No damage was done.
Flames which originated from an
oil stove heater set the chicken coop
ablaze at the rear of the R. McCall
residence. Although the department
made a quick run the building was
destroyed. Three out of forty blood
ed Buff Orpington chickens were
saved. The damage amount to about
$50.
Smoke pouring from the crevices
of a refrigerator car was the cause
of an alarm this morning. A blaze
had made its way between the walls
of the car. The car was backed to
the Union depot where a stream of
water quickly extinguished the fire.
An oil lamp heater caused the flames.
