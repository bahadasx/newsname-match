NATIONAL TOPICS
ARE DISCUSSED
(Special Correspondence. )
Washington, u. c\, Keu a».—
Tt.e object of tiie tiulldillc policy
formulated in Jmoj by the navy gen
eral hoard, it was disclosed today be
fore tiie bouse naval committee, was
to keep the United States ahead of
Germany in ttie race for naval su
premacy.
The statement was made by Bear
Admiral Charles J Badger, a mem
ber of I lie general board who ex
plained that toe policy had contem
plated a tleet of forty-eight first line
battleships hy lui» to accomplish it*
purpose.
1 lie statement .'id hot g» into the
records of tiie heartng and Admiral
Badger did not amplify it to show
why tiie board had thought .such a
course necessary. The admiral was
relying to a suggestion ttiat the ob
ject of the old policy, abandoned tills
yeai by the board, Was to keep the
American navy In second place.
IVlille that, was tiie effect it had, he
said, the real object was to keep
ahead of Germany.
Tills yeai the board fixed as Its pol
icy Hie creation by 1925 of a fleet
equal to tiie most powerful afloat at
that lime. Tiie committee did not
go Into tiie iMiaid's leasons for chang
ing its ideas beyond drawing out tiie
explanation that the board believed a
fleet 10 per cent superior to any
lighting forte toat might be brought
against it would be necessary tu In
sure against the invasion of Ameri
can soil by an enemy.
Undei questioning by Represent
ative Kelley Admiral Badger said
the construction if three additional
dreadnought» and eigiit battle cruis
ers would place the navy on a par
wltn the capital ships of the German
fleet today. Gesmaiiv now lias
twenty-two dreadnoughts and eight
bitlle cruisers, lie said, according to
Die best available Information,
while tiie United States lias, all
told, nineteen ships of the dread
nought class or building.
To equal Great BritlHiTs piobable
fleet within two years, Admiral
Badger said tue United States
would tie ubllged to have a total
force of forty dread noughts, fit teen
battle cruiser, iwenty-ffve swift
scouting cruft, 200 submarines, and
250 destroyers. He was not favoring
such a ptogratu, but u.eiely answer
ing question» hy Representative but
1er. such a fleet could not be built
in t wo years he added, though It.
might he constructed in four.
Representative Butter said con
struction experts of tiie navy had
told the committee that Ute max
imum number of capital ships that
could be laid dowij at one time in
the United Stales was twenty-two
and ttiat they could be completed in
two years if the skilled labor could
be fouud. Admiral Butler thought
I lie armour output would not per
mit such rapid Construction and
Representative Butler ugreeo, saying
lie had been told "by the man who
sells armor to the government,'' that
the maximum possible output
64,000 ions u year, or enough to equip
eight or nine heavy ships.
Chairman Padgett remarked that
tiie armor manufacturers had told
tiie Investigating commission last
yem that they could produce only 2«, •
000 tons annually.
In urging a great increase in the
fleet Admiral Badger said lie did n it
wish to he understood as saying the
present force was not a thoroughly
efficient one.
"1 did not want to give the Im
pression," tie said, "that our fleet;
Is no good Ttie Only trouble with it
is that it's not big enough for possi
bilities. It's a good fleet, well
d Hied, well equipjied, and well or
ganiz d. Vie are now prepared just
as far as our power will permit us to
be More power means more ships.''j
Regarding the present place of the
United States fleet among the na
vies of tiie world, Admiral Badger
said lie cia-sed it as third in fighting
power with France a close fourth.
*•] tliInk we are number three,' he
said." Japan is coming along, but
lias a go d dea) to do to equal
Heel. In military power— fighting
efficiency —I think we «re a pretty
good tbirJ. with France not far he

Natural Range for Them In Big
Creek Country, Where Animals
Used to Abound.
The local game protective ass, .cl >
tion, through Ur. Han, sent a night
letter to tiie state game warden Sun- 1
day night asking upon wuat terms a
carload of elk could be obtained for
restocking the Big creek country
wiiii these animals Tuesday even
ing Ur. Hart and all tiie other lovers
of big game In Salmon were rejoicing
over ttie repot t that had reached
them, not. however, from Warden
Jones, that carload of elk were to
come on here trom Armstead on Wed
nesday's train. The report was
mighty good news if true, hut it waa
not true.
Tiie sporlvmen thought it a little
funny that Jones wuuld seod tiie elk
witiiout even waiting for tiie formal
ord«r for them, but still expectations
ran iiigii until Wednesday noon when
word came ttiat tiie carload coming
this way were in reality consigned
somewhere else altogether. It is al
together probable that a consignment
will be secured for Salmon. They
are to come from the Teton».
When they do get here It uiay lie
that hay will be provided them and
then they are to Ue turned out on

abounded until a tew years ago when
they were exterminated by methods

MORE BUSINESS FOR

The visit to Salmon of tiie officials

MULLEN'S RICH STRIKE
ON PITTSBURG-IDAHO
SALT LAKE, Feb 2»— Lessees
operating on the Pittsburg-Idaho
property, located near Gilmore. Ida
ho, have made what the management
is Inclined to believe is a most im
portant strike They ate ut prêtent
sacking a high-gr de gold ore. Some
of the sumples taken rati as high as
tlixG to the tun. other samples ran
*170 to the ton. Grab «amples taken
from the product at different places
along the ore body gave an average
ol about <700 to the toil. It is too
! early to determine the average ship
1 ping value of the ore.
I Some mouths ago, Daniel Mullen,
I a leasee, and Ids associates leased a
{ block of ground from 'lie company on
j what is known as tiie Sliver Dollar
claim They began driving to tiie
{south from tiie main tunnel at about
j500 feet from the portal. They did
! considerable work, but t illed to In
{cate any ore.
Ttie company «ranted them a lease
in tiie old working» of ttie property
jon an ore body, and they shipped
two car loads of ore, after which they
decided to dissolve their partnership,
Mr. Mullen wishing to return to the
Silver Dollar claim and bis partner
desiring to remain at work in the ore
In the old workings. Mr Mullen re

afterward lie encotjntered the gold
