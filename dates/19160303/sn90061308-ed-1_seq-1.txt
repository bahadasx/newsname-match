PUBLIC SERVICE COM-
MISSION REJECTS MOST
OF. FRISCO PLAN
Clim That Modified Plan la Contrary
to Missouri Constitution .
.- Springfield, March 2. The modified
plan for the reorganization of the
Frisco railroad submitted by Festus
J. Wade of St. Louis, was rejected
in most of its features Wednesday by
the Missouri public service commis
sion at Jefferson City, according to
dispatches received. ( No reorganiza
tion plan is now before the commis
sion. .
The rejected plan was similar to
that announced by the reorganization
managers in New York Sunday night.
A feature distinguishing it from the
original plan was that the stockhold
ers wouldhave four instead of two
representatives on the board of trus
tees that was. to control the Toad for
five years. .
The commission rejected the pro
posed voting trust and also the sec
tion of the Wade plan permitting vot
ing trustees to become parties to pri
vate contract made with themselves
for the railroad .
The modified plan of Mr. Wade was
filed on February 18 and the commis
sion decided to regard li a the motion
for a modification of the original re
organization plan which the commis
sion in part had approved and in part
rejected.

THE STORY OF A BUNDLE OF
STICKS
A long time ago an old man, wbo
didn't expect to live many years,
called his six sons to him and said
"My boys, I have here a bundle
of six sticks which I have tied to
gether. I want to see which of
you boys can break this bundle of
Sticks. John, you are the strong
est, suppose you try first."
John took the Bundle of Sticks.
He bent them across his knee. He
strained and pulled v , In vain. He
could not breaks the , Bundle of
Sticks. u , .............
Each of the sons tried to break
the Bundle of Sticks, without suc
cess. They could not be broken.
Then said the' old father
"Boys, NO one can break that
Bundles of Sticks so long as they
are all tied together. But ANY
one could break a single stick.
Just so long as you boys stick to
gether yqu are SAFE . . When each
one goes on his own hook you are
NOT safeany one can break you."

, A NATIONAL Bank cannot in
vest your money where you cannot
get it when you need it. It MUST
be able to pay every depositor in

ON ARMED
SHIP x QUESTION
President Wilson Will Not Be Satis
fied with Expression of Confidence
. Refuses to Continue Negotia
tions with Germany Until
Congress Acts
Washington, March 1
President
Wilson served notice on congress to
night that he will consent to nothing
less than a record vote on the anti
administration's resolutions to warn
Americans oft the armed ships of Eu
ropean belligerents before he goes on
with the German submarine negotia
tions. -
No compromise proposition, such as
a vote of confidence in the president's
foreign policy, will be acceptable.
Such an action, it is held, might be
construed in Berlin as justifying the
opinion that the president lacks the
support of congress and his own party
in his demands for a full observance; of
international law, while its only pur
pose would be to afford members of
congress a way to avoid recording
their positions before the country on
the straight out-and-out question.
President Wilson made his position
clear to congressional leaders tonight
in unequivocal terms as the climax to
a day Of confusion, uncertainty and
political maneuvering that marked the
opening of his first real fight with
congress.
' As if to emphasize that the presi
dent absolutely refuses to continue the
negotiations with Germany until the
attitude of congress is settled, it was
made known that the United States
does not consider the latest assurances
from Count von Bernstorff, the Ger
man ambassador, as broad or as satis
factory as those originally given, No
further step will be taken, however,
while the president waits on congress.
Meanwhile the pending Lusitania
agreement will not be finally accepted.
The whole situation in congress,
confused by the president's call yes
ter for a vote, was thrown into a snarl
today when at an early morning con
ference the president outlined his po
sition to Chairmen Stone and Flood of
the foreign affairs committees, Senate
Leader Kern, Speaker Clark, House
Leader Kitchin and Acting Chairman
Pou of the house of rules committee;
ATTEMPTS TO TAKE OWN LIFE
Lou Wolfenbarger attempted suicide
on Wednesday night of last week by
taking strychnine at the farm , on
which he is living northeast of this
city.
For the past few weeks he has been
located about Claremore, Okla., but
came back home a few days ago. He
claims to have been held up and rob
bed of about $260 at Monett on his
way home. He has been into some)
entanglements in a financial way and
it is believed worry over his difficult
ies prompted the act.
He was at home with his family
when he tookthe dose of poison. The
family sent for a physician who found
him in a dangerous condition but
treatment saved his life. He had writ
en a note which was found by his wife
in his coat pocket. The note gave his
excuse for the act. Lon's father lives
