. "I object to any remarks. ; If the

' ft-nator McCumber opened tho fight
iinexpectedly by offering a atibatltute

validity of the aubmarlna situation,
It waa the duty of every American

Thereupon, Senator James called
up the Gore resolution, and demand

Core countered with an amend
ment to tils resolution and nked pur
minion to dlBouas it. It stated that!
tho death of an American through
a submarine attack should be deemed
a cause of war.
' This eleventh-hour move came as
an unexpected surprise, as It meant
practically a new resolution, amount
ing to an ultimatum to the central
"powers, and aulisoqnont developments
showed It caused a change of several
votes, , ..:.'.:' ' y; . .;-,' .'"'''',-.','"'

Senator James again demanded a

Sonator Clark lntorposod with a
point of order that tho amended re

The vote ratiftod President Wll-
son'a "free bond" In tho foreign
i
gotlotlons. And since the. president
had boen freely quoted aa Baying that
if congress took part in handling the
delicate Gorman situation war might
aotte an Improbability, the vote was
regarded as cleaving away tho war
clouds, which ad'mlnlstrntlon loaders
frankly said had lowered luat night.
Several congressmen,' however,
took the view that in turning over
to ' tho, president full power lu the
nvgoiluttons the senate had commit
ted ltRelf to whatever course he
might take, even if it led to war.
In ostensibly dlHcusuhig the Shields
waterpower bill, Senators- , Itccd,
Jones and Clarke started the flht
over -again. Clarke declared that tho
senate had stultified itBolf ihy decid
ing the Goro question under tho "gag
rule." Ho scored munitions' exports,
too, nnd said that except for such
unneutral acts on America's part the
war would have closed months ago.
'Following Clarke, Senator Jones
declared: . I
''I hope this' dlfloupslon will serve!
as a warning aud .suvo Americana
from a delude of blood, M no selflHh
American, :y c.terclHlng the right of

Jones contended that the senate
had 'been gagged and that a Vote on
the merits of the resolution had .en
prevented and ' predicted that the
Issue would como up again.
t Senator Clarke declared
'if President Wilson Is wrong, he
ought to be stopped. W are not
going around with a chip on our
shoulder, nor are; we going to wr
because of an academic question up
on which even college professors are
not agreed.
"We have reached no conclusion,"
said Senator Galilnger. "I should
have voted for the rights of Ameri
cans to travel on an armed ship, but
l would not do so under a gas; rule."
OalUnser favored firmness in deal
ing with International problems.
"If we had been firm In our media
tion policy, Instead of weak aud al
mols apologetic," he said, ' "nearly
J00 Americana would not now He
murdered la Mexico. President Wil
son,' In his letter to Congressman
Pou, urged public discussion, so that
he might know the sentiments of
congress! What does he know now?
f believe la publicity not In shoving
rt-suiutioa through the Svnatd like
jamming a plank through a national
convention."-" : ' '
"The means we used," Interrupted
Senator Lewis, "were necessary to
execute th ; International policy
Uhlch Senator Galllnger defends."
Senator Borah tunned the senate
action a "degradation," while Sen
ator Sherman called H "'cowardice
and evasion
Many senators intimated that the
vote is not final, and It seemed cer
tain that If a break with Germany
threatened senators would renew
thdlr fight for congressional action.
President Wilson received the
news of the senate vote while at
tending a session with bis cablm-t.
Doth . he and other officials were
gratlflod
The White House declared the vpte
was entirely satisfactory. .
But senators admitted it was
doubtful whether the senate had ac
tually Announced Itself aa against
wsr or had committed itself to any
thing the president did. . -; :-
Commenting upon the situation,
Senator Gore declared:
"I do not know what senators
think who voted down my resolution.
My object In introducing a substltuto
was to prevent a wrong construction
bolng given to the tabling of the
original, Everybody proposed to in
ne-'terpret tabling of the original "as a
.declaration that congress should not
Interfere with diplomatic negotia
tions which might lead to war. This
Interpretation would have beenIn
correot. - ' ; ''. ;
"The "original resolution made an
offer for, peace, When a wrong con
struction was to be given to tnbllng
it, I offered the substitute. In that,
I proponed that .eongrcRS should de
clare Itself, clearly and tinequlvocal

with Germany it a submarine kilts

Press query today are Indicative of
public eentiment, ' the American
people do not ibolleve congress Bhould

out by the United Press was in favor
of President Wilson: . :
"We are requesting all governors
to give their Interpretation of pnblic
sentiment In their, states as to the
course congress should take" on Pre
sident Wilson's letter to Acting
Chairman Pou of the .'h'ous rules
committee, requesting a vote on a
resolution to. warn Americans from
armed Ships. We would greatly ap
preciate your statement."
A number obviously though It un
wJbo to mako any comment, but a
sample of the replies received was
the following from Governor Withy
combe of Oregon: ' v
"At this time of International crisis
I tielleve congress should uphold the
hands of President Wilson, who es
sentially must administer matters
pertaining to foreign relations."
Governor Alexander of Idaho an
swered: "The Issue should e forced
and congress should show tho world
that America stands united with Pre
sident Wilson In sustaining laws
built up through' centuries, but
threatened with destruction in the
European chaos and war passion."
From Governor Stewart of Mon
tana came the following: -
Montanans generally are with Pre
sident Wilson and sympathise with
his efforts to prevent Involving
America in war. Trusting to his wis
dom, they are net disposed to 'rock

Work was commenced this morn
ing In preparing for the foundation
for the sugar factory in South Grama
Pass, the site as finally decided upon
being at the southeast corner of the
50-aere tract, about where the mov-
ing pictures were made when ground
was first turned. .This was the site
first decided upon, but owing to the
seepage of water from the bills baek
it was feared that some trouble
might e experienced la getting the
proper foundation. The engineers
have determined, however, that the
water can all be drained into the
creek, leaving the site firm and dry.
The first car of steel, which arrived
Thursday morning, is being unload
ed upon the site.
Work In the field Is fast being
started, and seeding will, be com
menced npoo. a small scale within a
few days, though the bulk of the
crop will not be planted till later.
A shipment of five seeders was re
ceived for here today and a like ship
ment went through to Medford. These
seeders were forwarded from Salt
Lake city to be used till the regular
shipment of machinery la received
from the east The seeders will each
plant four rows of beets, the rows
being 20 Inches apart.
The caterpillar tractor received &y
the sugar company some days ago,
and which has been In use clearing
the factory Site, wan sent out to the
New Hope ditarict today, having in
i tow a three-bottom plow, and if will
be put Into commission turning, the
sod for he beet crop. It will first
be used upon the acreage which has
been leased by Jack Tanolsakl, going
today to the Parkey place. Mr.
Tanolsakl has already leased 175
acres In that district, and expects, to
close with others In the next few
days. ' -. "; '.

Paris, Mar. 3. Renewal of the

today that the. kaiser's offensive is
the "real thing."
Its cost Is ghastly. German dead

hills so that from a distance the
fields seem covered with a strange
gray-green growth. ,
Not alone because of such sacri
fices as this vision gives, tout also
because of the German preparations
and shelling, critics believe the drive
against Verdun Is not a feint. They
are not unmindful, though, of the
possibility of a sudden thrust in the
Champagne or nearer to Paris along
the Alsne.
Witnesses of the struggle agree
that , the Verdun battle constitutes
the-heaviest fighting of the entire
war. The Germans are shooting
many times more shells than the
French did in September In the
Champagne offensive, and the flower
of the German troops Is participating,
Despite his losses, the kaiser must
strike with his maximum strength,
it Is ibelieved, or his prestige and
morale will suffer. It he succeeds in
capturing Verdun, the war will only
be prolonged; it It falls, he must
realize that he Is definitely beaten.
Paris calmly and confidently awaits
the outcome, believing that In the
final turn of the battlewheel success
will' rest with the trl-color.
