GLENN ANSWE
SPEECH IN
New Yorker Points Out Oreai
Service of President Wilson
in Keeping Country
at Peace.
Syracuse, N. Y., March 1.?Former
Gov. Martin H. Glynn, at the Democratic
State conference here tonijrht,
Kave his party's answer to the speech
of Former United States Senator
Flihu Root before the Republican
State conference in New York several
weeks apro. He answered Mr. Root's
charpres aprainst the present national
administration and took Mr. Root to
task for his speeches in the United
States senate and for his acts as secretary
of state.
The federal reserve act, the Underwood
tariff, foreign affairs and prenaredness
were all dwelt upon bv the
former governor.
"Four years ago." he said, "this nation
committed its care and welfare
to the Democratic party, and the
Democratic party has been true to its
trust. It has preserved peace, observed
international laws and followed
the traditions of the fathers of the
country."
After reviewing the legislation enacted
during the Democratic contro!
of congress Mr. Glynn replied to Mr.
Root's reference to the federal reserve
act. He charged that Mr. Root
as senator opposed the passage of the
measure.
A Great Deed.
"This law," continued Mr. Glynn,
"is one of the greatest achievements
in the last 50 years. There never has
been a finer exhibition of foresight
and statesmanship than that exhibited
by the president in insisting upon
the passage of the federal reserve
act."
This legislative act, Mr. Glynn continued,
enabled the financial officers
to meet the demands made upon
American business and' financial in
cerests wnen the European war began
and saved them from a repetition- of
.the papic .of 1907, which, the speaker
said, wTTSff" always be an "InJTxctment
of tha Republican party."
? "** "''Mr. -Root," he declared, "was a
"art of Mr. Roosevelt's administration
in 1907 and shares with Mr. Roosevelt
and the leaders of the Republican
party the responsibility for the
wholly unnecessary and calamitous
haonenings of that panic."
Mr. Root, the Democratic chairman
asserted, voted and worked against
the reserve act.
The Underwood tariff law has
"stimulated American industry," the
former governor declared, and he
blamed the foreign war for the decline
in imports.
Question of Politics.
Denying that Mr. Root was "the
keeper of national honor" Mr. Glynn
added: "For years Mr. Root has beei
>iar performer at peace conferences
and yet he condemns President Wilson
for maintaing peace."
"For years," continued the speaker,
"Mr. Root has been acclaimed an
apostle of peace and in 1912 was
awarded the Nobel prize for the promotion
of peace hut now he sallies
forth as a drum and trumpet statesman.
* * *
"Mr. Root may beat his drunmhead
and blare his trumpet but President
Wilson will go right on winning the
plaudits of the American people by
appealing to reason, humanity and
common sense and by keeping the
I'nited States the uncompromising
champion of the neutral world and
the undaunted naintainer of the
principles which have guided the
nation since 177(5."
In his foreign policy the president,
Mr. Glynn said, was following the
example of Washington, John Adams,
Jefferson, Lincoln and Grant.
"The president," he declared, "has
only shaken his finger, when he has
to shake his fist the world will find it
:i~-i * * *
mailed. T
"The efforts of politicians like Mr.
f'oot to make political capital out of
the course which President Wi!?on
deemed it wise for his nation to fol'ow
in respect to Belgium during the
early stages of the present war \v:li
receive unqualified condemnation arid
rebuke from most right thinking and
patriotic Americans.
CONFEDERATE VETERAN DIES.
Mr. .1. Munro Fant died at Chappells
Saturday and his remains were
brought to Union Sunday for burial in
the Presbyterian cemetery. Mr. Fant
was a Confederate Veteran, and up to
a few years ago, was a resident of

older residents of Union.

RS ROOT'S
STRONG STYLE
I REV. J. B. BOZEMAN CALLED.
Has Accepted Pastorate Second Baptist
Church, and Severing His Position
With The Times.
Rev. J. B. Bozeman was recently
called to the pastorate of the Secnod
Baptist church, this city, and has accepted
the call. The church extended
the call for full time and upon the
condition that Mr. Bozeman devote all

This necessitated his withdrawing

*>f The Tfmes.
Feeling called to devote all his energies
to the work of the ministry, he
has severed his connection with the
paper.
The field to which he has gone presents
very great opportunities for service
and Mr. Bozeman was centred
upon by the congregation as the man
well-fitted to use the opportunities.
He has entered upon his work theie
with very flattering prospects.

WILLING TO PERMIT
DYESTUFFS TO PASS.
British Government Agrees to Allow
Two Cargoes to Come From Rotterdam
to America.
Washington, Feb. 28.?Great Britain
will permit the shipment of two
cargoes of dyestuffs, valued at $5,000.
000, from Rotterdam to the United
States, Ambassador Page at London
has advised the state department, and
officials here are hopeful that Germany
will make an exception to its
"inbargo by granting permission for
their exportation.
Ambassador Page said that the
British foreign office had given him
assurances that the cargoes would not
be interfered with.
Negotiations with Germany for release
of dyestuffs have failed heretofore
because Germany demanded in
exchange various commodities barred
by the British orders in council. The
negotiations will be resumed immediately
through Ambassador Gerard at
Berlin.
Rather than stand up for their
principles some men will sit down on
a cushion and let their money talk.
