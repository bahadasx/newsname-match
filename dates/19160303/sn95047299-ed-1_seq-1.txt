High School Gets Valuable Books.
The plans for "Donation Day" at
the Putnam high school were quite
successfully carried out on Washing
ton's Birth Day, the friends of the
school responding generously to the
needs of the library as evidenced by
the fact that seventy-five or more
good books were donated, besides sev
eral dollars in cash.
Among the more valuable books
donated must be mentioned "The His
tory and Progress of the World," in
ten volumes, handsomely bound in
half morocco, and perfectly new
the gilt ot Horn Harry Gray. lhis
gift is especially appreciated as it
fills a long felt want for a work on
history. The thanks of the faculty
and entire student body are extended
to Mr. Gray for this valuable set of
books.
Then must be mentioned also a set
of Cooper's works presented by Mrs.
Col well; a set of Kipling by Mrs.
Squier; a set of Hugo's novels by
Mrs. Melton; Chambers' Encyclopae
dia by Mrs. Kalbfield; and many in
dividual volumes by various ones too
numerous to mention in this connec
tion. To all these friends of the school
the faculty and students are grateful
and appreciative of both the gifts
and the interest represented by the
gifts.

SENATOR NAT BRYAN
IS SURE JIT-STUFF."
Boiling With Indignation He
Lambasts "Guardians
of Liberty."
Hon. N. P. Bryan, Florida's junior
U. S. Senator arrived in Palatka last
Saturday, and in the evening address
ed a crowd at the corner of Lemon
and Third streets.
Chief Livingston, made no attempt
to stop him.
It was band night, and the concert
had just closed. Mr. J. N. Blackwell
arose from a dry-goods box and in
stentorian tones called upon the peo-
le to halt; then he introduced sena
tor Bryan.
Senator Bryan delivered a "hot"
talk. He defended the original res
olutions of the State Executive Com
mittee, and lambasted the organiza
tion toward whose members those res
olutions were aimed.
He told of the reason for abolish
ing the conventions in 1900, stating
they did not give the people a chance
to see and know candidates. Speak
ing of the much discussed sections
four and five Senator Biyan said they
were new provisions but were taken
out of the primary law of 1907. He
said, "I have been accused of domin
ating the state executive committee
on the adoption of the resolutions on
the qualifications of voters. I did
not. In drafting the new law I re
quired men to swear to their party
affiliation. It can do no harm to
keep a republican from voting in a
democratic primary or vice versa. If
a man swears he is a democrat and
understands what he says, then sec
tions two, three, four and five are
unnecessary.
He laid bare what he said were tne
veal purposes of the organizations,
saying it was not, as some people be
lieved, formed in order to keep down
any particular religious sect, but the
sole and only purpose was to mawu
money for the men at the head. He
quoted figures that showed the fool
ishness of people believing that any
particular sect could overthrow the
ravernment and constitution of the
state or of America. There are but
four per cent, of Catholics in the
state, he said, and it is folly to sup
pose they can dominate.
"The reason for this society, gen
tlemen, is that the leaders may get
money and secure political power.
lWilo Vinvn vmthinkinirlv ioined these
societies, thinking it patriotic and I
ask such men to get out ot it. l ney
have been deceived by the meanest
of nf tspniimb'pls that, ever undertook
to take away the liberties of the peo
ple. 1 owe a (leut to tne wncue peo
ple of Florida I can't pay. I have
tried to show my appreciation by ta lo

be true to the people and want the
momlim'O nf tilia SOfMPt.V t.O tVllllk
whether or not they should come out
of it and vote as they please. for
the leaders I have a different feeling.
Are we so stupid that we have to have
a representative come 4t)Wn here
from New York to tell us what to do,
or a non-descript from Pennsylvania ?
I say the object of the leaders is to
attack any church if there is money
in it for them."
Senator Bryan then produced what
he said purported to be the constitu
tion of the Guardians of Liberty,
which was procured by Mr. Stur
kie of Pasco county who has been
much abused by this society. This
was analyzed by the speaker in a
few words. One of the oaths of the
body is that no member shall dis
close any information about another
member.
"This means, gentlemen, that even
in crime they would have to withhold
a man's name," he said.
"The whole political power may be
exercised by three men. Section 2,
Article 1 of the constitution sets forth
that the national committee consists
of five officers. The national court
reserves the despotic power to pass
on all questions of policy and dis
pute that may arise between the state
and local courts.
"Section 2, article 7 .relates to the
support of a candidate for public of
fice. In the state and national courts,
five constitute a quorum, and the
thing is arranged so that the national
body can control state courts, the
state, the local courts and so on
down the line, so that the whole pow
er lies in the hands of three men, con
stituting a majority in the national
of Russia has no
such power, and here is where it is
going to break down. When any
five men undertake to have the mem
f flu irw.nl pmirf. vote for some
one that they don't want, then it will
break down. The penalty ior not

this state should send word to Gen
eral Miles that we can get along
without his help.

SCHOONER PALATKA
REACHEDJjEW YORK
Last Saturday After a
Stormy Trip Was Long
v Overdue.
Reports were current on the streets
of Palatka last week that the new
schooner "Palatka," launched in this
place last October, had been driven
on the reefs on its initial trip to
New York, lumber laden from the
Wilson Cypress Company's mills.
ihis report was without foundation.
Messrs. Searls and Denton, owners of
the boat, did pass some sleepless
nights; they were anxious; the
schooner was long overdue, and it was
known that there was a fierce storm
over the Atlantic coast.
Their anxiety ceased on Saturday,
when they received a dispatch from
Capt. Bennett announcing his safe ar
rival in New York.
Messrs. Searls and Denton have
gone to New York; they have had a
good cash offer for the ship and one
which if they accept will make them
something between $15,000 and $20,
000 in good profit over and above the
cost of construction and equipment.
The chances are they will sell. This
is a good year for ship builders. If
they sell, the chances are they will
build another.
Presbyterian Church.
Next Sunday morning, the pastor,
Rev. C. M. Alford, D. D., will preach
on the subject of "Conscience." In
the evening, the topic will be "Over
coming the World." An offering for
foreign mission will be taken. Self-
denial envelopes to be brought in.
Sunday school meets at 9:45 a. m.,
and mid-week prayer meeting Wed
nesday evening at 7 :30. ' A cordial
welcome to all these services.
Surnrise For Father Charles.
Tl. . : j? c.i Tit : ...
Catholic church met at the rectory on
Tuesday evening, where a surprise
had been planned for the new priest,
Father Charles, and for his brother,
Edward St. Anama of Toronto, Can
ada. The new pastor is a most de
lightful man to meet and his congre
gation feel justly proud of him. His
brother has recently redecorated the
interior of both the church and rec
tory, and gave his time and talent
tree ot charge, so the gathering Tues
day evening was of a double nature,
both as a welcome and an apprecia
tion. Jerry Sullivan in behalf of the
congregation, presented Mr. St. Ana
ma with a beautiful silk umbrella.
There were many present. The Cath
olics will give a larger public recen
lion in tne near luture, so that many
more will have the opportunity of
meeting rawer Lnaries.
Murray-Rosenborough.
The Atlanta Journal's society col
emu on Sunday last contained the fol
lowing announcement:
. "Mr. and Mrs. John Presley Jen
nings of Greenwood, S. C, announce
the engagement of their sister, Miss
.Mamie Murray, to Mr. John Alexan
der Rosborough, Jr., of Palatka, Fla.,
the wedding- to take place at home,
March 25th, inst. No cards.
Mr. Rosborough is a son of Hon.
John A. Rosborough of Windsor, Al
achua county, ex-Commander-in-Chief
of the United Confederate Veterans
of Florida. The groom is a railroad
man, connected with the Ocklawaha
Valley R. R., and for the past year
has boarded at the Saratoga Hotel,
with the guests of which house he is
very popular, as he is with all who
know him. His brother is Dr. Ros
borough of Rodman, a physician well
known in Palatka.
Worth Careful Thought
Do you read the label to know whether
your baking powder is made from cream
of tartar or, on the other hand, from alum
or phosphate?
Royal Baking Powder is made from
cream of tartar, derived from grapes, and
adds to the food only wholesome qualities.
Other baking powders contain alum or
phosphate, both of mineral origin, and
used as substitutes for cream of tartar
because of their cheapness.
Never sacrifice quality and healthful
ness for low price.

New York
Sheriff Kennerly Announces.
The announcement of Sheriff Ken
nerly as a candidate for re-nomination
to the office of Sheriff in the
June democratic primaries appears in
this edition of The News.
The announcement will occasion no
surprise, as it has all along been un
derstood that Mr. Kennerly would be
a candidate to succeed himself.
R. Lee Kennerly has been sheriff
of Putnam county for the past eight
years; previous to that time he served
as deputy under Sheriff Howell. He
is a kindly, generous hearted man who
is well-known and appreciated by the
people in all parts of the county, and
has the reputation for having conduct
ed the affairs of his responsible of
fice in a thorough manner. He
makes a fine officer; thoroughly un
derstands its requirements and his du
ties, and in event of his re-election,
promises to do his duty in the future
as he has in the past.
political or social outcast of any class
of citizen, Jew or Gentile, Protestant
or Catholic, so help me God. I will
surrender my commission first."
"What is the head of the democrat
ic party in this country,?" he shouted,
"Billy Parker and Catts, or Woodrow
Wilson? It is the duty of the dem
ocratic party to keep Florida democratic."
Senator Bryan spoke in this vein
for a long time; it was plain to see
that he waa mad clear through.
Friends of the senator say he never
acquitted himself on the stump any
thing like h did on tms occasion.
Others sav that only a very brave man
would talk in the manner which char
acterized the senator's speech.
For a time the crowd stayed with
him, but gradually it began to dwin
dle, and when the senator reached his
peroration there wasn't over twenty
standing around.
TO LAY CORNER-STONE
Palatka Postoffice Building
, Imposing Ceremonial.
Before the hour for the corner
stone laying of Palatka's new federal
building last Saturday, the Masonic
fraternity, resident and visiting,
formed in parade and marched out
l.pm(ln Kf.rpot: jinH Vinpk n -flip cifA
the ceremonial through Reed street
headed by the second Kegiment Hand.
It was an imposing spectacle, espe
cially that part of the parade occu
pied by the Knights Templar, a
branch of Masonry that rags itself in
a becoming uniform and sword, with
a G. Washington hat.
there were lully 250 Masons and
TCni'trVit.c in thp nnvnlp nnrl siTYinrto.
them were some of the foremost men
in t lorida. Masonry attracts to- its
ranks only men of known character,
and the parade was therefore made up
of the real creme de la creme of
Florida's manhood. And the narade
looked the part.
Former Grand Master h. 1'.. Haskell
of this city, on arriving at the scene
of the stone laying, called for silence,
when he introduced Rev. P. Quintius
Cason, who delivered the invocation.
Following the prayer, a selection
was rendered by the band, after
which Hon. S. J. Hilburn, orator of
the day was introduced.
Mr. Hilburn was in a happy frame,
and his address, though short, was
crowded with expressions of the grat-

or which had come to us in a special

epocn m tne development ot tne uem
City.
Col. Hilburn dwelt for some little
time to a showing of the strides Pa
latka was making- toward a city of
the first-class, and its final recogni
tion as such by the Federal govern
ment, as indicated by an appropria
tion of upwards of $(50,000 for this
building. Mr. Hilburn was at his
best on this occasion, and no less t-ian
a hundred citizens and .trang-3rs
have called the News' attention to the
excellence of his address. He seem
ed to feel every word he said.
At the conclusion of Col. Uilburn't'
address, Hon. W. P. Merriam, mayor
of Palatka, stepped forward and in a
few appropriate remarks presented
Grand Master Crane with a silver
trowel, the same for use in laying
the stone. Here the ceremony prop

PALATKA TOURISTS
TO ORGANIZE A CLUB
For Social and Intellectual
Intercourse, etc.
S. A. Parshley is that rather stout
looking gentleman with mustache and
chin gotee, whom you have seen on
the streets during the past winter
and whom many of us at first sight
have taken for Ex-U. S. Senator Sam
uel Pasco of Monticello. Mr. Parsh
ley isn't guilty of any thing worse
since coming' here than taking a lik
ing to the town and mingling all
through his waking hours with the
people. When he goes back to his
home town of Carthage, Missouri, we
hope he s going to carry some pleas
ant recollections of Palatka some
that will do us good.
We only speak of him because he
is one of the instigators of a pro
posed organization of a Tourist's
Club for this city.
With him is C. D. Brown of Syra
cuse, N. Y., who has been coming to
1 alatka winters tor a number oi years
and still likes us, possibly as well as
Palatkan's like him.
These gentlemen have called a
meeting of all tourists and visitors
to meet at the board of trade room
tomorrow (Saturday) afternoon to or
ganize. They want Palatka citizens
who are not too busy making money
to come in and help in the organi
zation with words of encouragement,
both ladies and gentlemen. The
meeting will be at 4 o'clock.
It is hoped at this meeting to form
a permanent organization and elect
officers for the season. A register
:s to be provided so that all visitors
may register by states.
Good idea; and it's a wonder it
h"dn't been thought of long ago.
Tourists have always aroused the
sympathy of The News. Some of
'em are getting along in years and
lon't care for playing pool and fish
ing and shooting and boating. They
have time on their hands and some
times it becomes heavy. This club
will lighten the load and give them
a place to swap yarns concerning the
wonders of their respective localities.
This winter has been a little better
en tourists than ordinary. We have
"fticed that many of them join Dr.
Ftes most every nice day and help
him superintend the construction of
the postoffice.
I,. C. Stephens on School Board.
Mr. L. C. Stephens of this city has
been appointed a member of the Put
nam county school board to fill out
I he unexpired term of F. D. Wattles,
resigned.
Mr. Stephens was endorsed for the
place by a large number of citizens
of the district, and his appointment
followed as a matter of course. He
served some years on the board of
county commissioners, of which body
he was chairman. Mr. Stephen is
one of the best men in the county.
His bond will likely be approved by
the county commissioners on Monday,
so that he can take his seat as a
member of the school board at its
March meeting next Tuesday.
Grand Sword Bearer, acting, Judge
John E. Marshall, Palatka,
Senior Grand Steward, acting, D.
P. Cannon, Peniel.
Junior Grand Steward, acting, Al
bert Edward Lounds, Crescent City.
Grand Tyler, acting, Nelson A.
Stumpe, Palatka.
Among the past Grand Masters of
Florida present at the ceremony were
Marcus Endel, Gainesville; Silas B.
Wright, DeLand; James Carnell, Or
mond, and Judge E. E. .Haskell of
this city.
A large number of Masons from all
over Putnam and adjoining counties
were present and took part in the pa
rade. The grand stand, seating over 600
people and erected on the street closa
to the site was early crowded, and
the streets leading to the spot were
blocked with people, anxious to view
the solemn and imposing spectacle.
