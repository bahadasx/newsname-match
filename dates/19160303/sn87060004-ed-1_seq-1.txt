Poisonous matter clogged in

this poison reaches the delicate

and that dull, throbbing, sicken

PAUL M. MOOR VICE
PRESIDENT, COMMITTEE
ON RULES AND ORDER
Louisville, Ky., Maroh 1. Ken
tucky Republicans held their state
convention this afternoon at Phoenix
Hill hall to nominate two electoral
candidates for the state at large, and
eight delegates from the state-at-large
to the National Republican
convention, to be held in Chicago in
June. .The convention was first an
nounced for the Gayety Theater, but
Investigation of the seating capacity
there caused the committee to
change to Phoenix Hill.
Thomas Dixon, of Scottsvllle, was
selected by the state central com
mittee to act as temporary cbalrmau
and J. L. MoCoy.of Jackson. at tern
porary secretary. Judge McKenzlo
Mum, of Bowling Green, has been
practically agreed on as permanent
chairman.
Kentucky Is entitled to four votes
from the state at large in the nation
at convention, bnt eight delegates
-will be sent with half la vote each.
The Fifth district convention in
dorsad two candidates, Instead of
one, because of this .fact. Candl-
Candldates who seem to have the
call and whom' local state leaders
say will be elected without serious
opposition are Edwin P. Morrow,
Congressman John W. Langley,
Congressman Caleb Powers, William
Marshall Bullitt, former Gov. Augus
tus E. Wlllson, Judge E. O. O'Kear
Richard P. Ernst and Phil Brown, a

pent in the wilderness, so shall the
protective tariff be lifted up in
America If this nation would be
healed," declared Thomas B. Dixon,
of Scottsvllle, Ky., in his address as
temporary chairman of the Repub
lican state convention here today.
Republican administrations from
1890 until the 'disaster of 1012,"
Mr. Dixon asserted, composed a
continuous march of progress, dur
ing which2 an "age ot gladness, a
period of happiness and content
ment" was enjoyed.
A groat collapse ib miinent, Mr.
Dixon continued; with no escape
from the violent reaction when the
great world war is ended.
"We will be the richest country in
the world, but the least respected.
All other nations will be the best
armed the best drilled, the most des
perate and the most needy. The
great mission ot the American na
tion should bo to prepare for this
awful hour, and I warn you that to
meet it properly and to settle it
safely will require as high order of
intelligence, statesmanship and
courage as thl nation lias ever
been called upon to display.
'The Republican party has always
been able to meet and successfully
dispose of every danger with which
our nation was confronted. No em
ergonoy ever arose but what she
could furnish men of Ideals and
courage equal to it. No danger ever
was dodged or legal responsibility
avoided.
"What we all want," deciaied Mr.
Dixon In closing his (address," is a
return to the principle ot 'safety
first' and old time Republican pros
perity."
