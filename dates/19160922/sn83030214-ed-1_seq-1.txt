which Mrs. Regina Klipper, of Phila?

When the Department ot Justice men

all the evidence pointed to New York
as the headi.uartcr* of the hlackmail

of the richest hauls had been iiade
there. and that some of the victtms

Neither wealth nor official position

is believed that with the Federal gov?

that never reveal -o much as they hint
Ht, will be shocked out of its rom

"We have r.ot yet found any case

LAST TRACTION PARLEY FAILS;
MITCHEL BLAMES BOTH SIDES
Union Members to Stay at Home and
"Await Proper Means of Transporta
tion"?Gompers Backs Men.
Determined tn attempt a general suspension of ______ to
aid tho striking car men, yet unwilling to take the responsibility
of ordering a general .trike, union leaders yesterday hit upon a
scheme they thought would obtain the desired result.
Thia pian. which will be considered by the conference com?
mittee in charge of the sympathetie strike movement this after?
noon. calls for an order to all union men to refrain from work
until such time as "proper means of transportation" from their
homes to their placos of employment is offered. Cars manned by
non-unionists and guarded by policemen will not be considered
up to this standard.
On the eve of the day set by the union leaders for the gen?
eral walkout, Mayor Mitchel and Oscar S. .Straus, chairman of
the Public Service Commission, further complicated the situation
by issuing a statement reviewing the progress of the transit
strike, alloting blame to both sides. They held that the general
strike would be but another mistake piled upon tho?e attribu
table to the union leaders, and Mayor Mitchel closed with the
significant statement that the entire "civic and military" power
would be called on, if necessary, to preserve order.
