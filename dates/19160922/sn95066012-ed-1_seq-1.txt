GERMANS IN VULCAN PASS
Berlin Reports that Commanding
Heights on Both Sides Have
Been Occupied.
London, Sept. 21. The German, Bui
garian and Turkish troops under Field
Marshal von Mackensen have been
defeated in the Rumanian province of
Dobrudja, according to the official an
nouncement from Bucharest. It is de
dared tiiat the invaders have retired
to the south and are burning villages
in their retreat.
The great battle, which was the
climax of Von Maekensen's swift
campaign in the Dobrudja district im
mediately after the declaration of
war by Rumania, began on September
15 and endod, says Rumanian head
quarters, on the 20th. With reference
to these operations Berlin merely
says that "fighting in Dobrudja has
come to a standstill."
Rumanians, Russians and Servians
were pitted against the invaders,
strong reinforcements having been
hurried to Dobrudja when the oper
ations under the noted German field
marshal threatened to overwhelm a
section of Rumania. A strong line to
the north was hastily fortified and
powerful forces were thrown out to
oppose the onslaughts fcf the central
powers. That the six-days' battle
has been a sanguinary one is indi
cated by the various official state
ments, which told of the intensity of
the fighting that has continued with
out cossation.
The latest official communication
from Bucharest confirms the entente
reports that the great . battle in
Dobrudja has ended in the defeat of
the central powers after six days'
fighting, says a dispatch from London
last ni&ht. The battle began last Fri
day, and gradually increased in scope
and intensity until Tuesday evening,
with the result that on Wednesday
the Germans, Hulgars and Turks,
crushed, were forced to withdraw,
burning villages in their line of re
treat in an effort to retard their pur
suers. The same communication, referring
to the Tranay l vania theater announces
that a Rumanian force has entered Or
dernel, better known as Szekely I'd
varhely, 50 miles northest of Kron
stadt. One-fourth of Transylvania is
now in Rumanian hands.
London, Sept. 21. A sudden change
has occurred In the situation in Du
bruja, where the Husso-Rumuniati
forces having retreated before the
Qi rmano-TiirUo-Uiilgarian Army un
der Field Marshal Mackensen to a
strong defensive line across the pro
vince from Maralin. (Marleanu.) on
the Danube, to Tuzla on the Black Sea
first checked the drive, resumed the
offensive, and, according to an offi
cial report received hen- tonight from
Bucharest, have forced the Invaders to
retreat. The line has been strength
ened by Russian reinforcements prob
ably landed at Constanza and Milch
may have been brought across the
Black Sea from the army of the Cau
casus. Berlin admits that the Ger
man operations "are at a standstill."
On the other hand, although Buch
arest reports that t tin Rumanian re
tirement mi the Transylvania front
has halted south of I'otroseny, where
defonses are lelng organized. Berlin
announces that German troops have
occupied the heights on both sides of
the Vulcan pass.

MITCHEL INSISTS
LAWLESSNESS
Mayor Informs Labor Leaders That
law Will Be Upheld
CONFERENCE ENDS IN FAILURE
Sympathetic Strike of 700,000'. Feder
ated Workers May Begin Before
Night.
New York, Sept. 22. Labor leaders
were given lornia! Warning by Mayor
Mitchel last night that he would em
ploy the "lull civil and military pow
ers" conferred upon him by law to
prevent disorders it the threatened
general strike of trades unionists is
called today to aid the street car em
ployes, who quit their places the Gth.
rhe mayor's communication was ad
dressed to Hugh Frayne, chairman of
the conference committee of labor
leaders, after a final effort to arrange
peaceful settlement had failed and
following the declaration that a gener-
ll strike was inevitable. The mayor
made it plain that for the union offici
als "to call these strikes will be to
assume full responsibility tor all that
may follow."
The communication, which was con
curred in by Oscar S. Straus, chair
man of the public service commission,
reviewed at length the causes whlcli
led to the present crisis. It started
that the Interboro rapid transit com
pany, which operates the subway and
elevated lines, violated a ver
bal agreement witli the labor
leaders by refusing to arbitrate issues
arising subsequent to the making of
the agreement. It stated, on the
other band, that the employes of the
New York railways company and the
other stirface lines affected by the
strike, "were guilty of a breach" of
contracts they had made with their
employers which ended a tie-up in
surface roads July 5.
The so-called Anal conference was
attended by Mayor Mitchel, a citizens'
(ommittic and t ho labor leaders. It
ended in a dcadlncki The mayor later
declared there was no "solution In
sight." while members of the cit
izens'.' committee described the situa
tion as "hopeless," adding that "It
would appear that both sides would
have to tight It out."
Krnest Rohm, secretary of the
central federated union, later as
serted that plans were completed for a
sympathetic strike of 70(1,000 workers
In other trades, and that the "walk
out" might begin today. Meantime the
state bureau cf mediation and arbi
tration had sent notices to the lead
ers of the striking carmen anil the
heads of the transit companies direct
ing them to appear before the board
Monday when. It Was said, hearings
tor the purpose of llmling'a way out of
the deadlock would be started.
Samuel (lumpers, president of the
American federation of labor, who
attended the mayor's conference, de
clared that he was with the strikers
"to the last ditch in their light for the
right to organize." Theodore P.
Shouts, president of the lntcrborough
rapid transit and the New York rail
ways companies, issued it statement In
whlcli he declared that "no union men
will be reinstated' by the Inter
borough, lie laid, however, that for
mer employes on the surface, cars of
the New Yi.tk railways company
would tie taken back "provided they
came free of unionism."
The police took extra precautions
last night to prevent a recurrence of
rioting which already has resulted in
many innocent persons being hurt,
considerable property damage and
mora wan ,gu arrests. There are
6700 policemen on strike duty.
Repeatedly during the early hours
yesterday Sixth ami Third-avenue ele
vated trains were assailed by strlki
sympathizer on rooftops. Twenty-two
such attacks were reported by the po
lice within a few hours. Oar win
dows were smashed under showers of
bricks and bottles and several passen
gers wete Injured.

MONROE CUTS TRAIL LINK
Montclair Professor and Party Contri
bute to Mountain Paths.
Prof. Will S. Monroe ol the Mont
clair State Normal school at Mont
clair. N. J., has made the gift of a
trail to the state of Vermont. Plans
were made by the Qreen Mountain
club of Vermont to clear the noted
"Long Trail" as far south as Lincoln
mountain in L916, and a small sum
raised for that purpose. This sum
mer, however, Prof. Monroe, who is an
enthusiastic woodsman, offered to fi
nance a trail cutting expedition and to
do the work wherever the Qreen
Mountain club thought advisable.
After surveyors had mapped out the
route of the trail, Prof. Monroe and J.
Ashton Kills ol Montclair, with Ker-
son Nurrlan of New York and several
other members of t lie Green Mountain
club, proceeded from Burlington to
the route of the proposed trail. Camp
Montclair was established and for
three weeks the trail cutting opera
tlons were conducted. The clubmen
made good progress, despite wet
weather, Intense heat, and black flies.
At intervals throughout the summer
other members, of the club Joined the
camp and aided In the work. The
clubmen some times had to use the
crosscut saw to cut away the fallen
trees on the trail. Prof, Monroe's gift
cf this valuable piece of trail is ex
pcrted to be ot inspirational value to
all the members of tho Green MOUB
tain club, and each season will prob
ably see some similar bit of trail per
fected by the personal work of the
clubmen,

MURDER INQUEST CONTINUED
Proceedings Will Be Reopened When
ever Occasion Necessitates. ,
Between 2 and 3 o'clock Thursday
afternoon tho inquest into the shoot
ing of William Costello, Whose body
with three bullet Wounds In the back
of the head was found near the Ver
mont soldiers' home crossing Saturday
night, temporarily adjourned subject
to the call of State's Attorney Frank
C. Archibald at any time.
There were not many new develop
ments during the day. A number of
persons were brought before Assistant
Judge II. N. Shaw for examination.
It was not expected that these wit
nesses would be able to give any evi
dence that would lead to the appre
hension of the murderer. They were
examined principally for the purpose
of substantiating facts which were al
ready fairly well established.
Not much light has been cast on the
mystery during the past two days.
Without a motive for the crime, the
officers have been unable to make
much headway. All of the officials
have worked industriously under the
direction of the state's attorney. Kvery
Circumstance that might lead to a clue
has been investigated thoroughly.
Since the inquest took its temporary
adjournment it has been learned that
the victim of the crime was seen on
Depot street after he had left the
home of Victor Young on County
.street. He was alone at the time.

DESERT 10 IIS
Bandit Leader's Raid on City Suc
cessful, Reports Gen. Bell'
TOOK THE GOVERNOR'S PALACE
Captured Artillery and Supplies and
Released 200 Prisoners from
Penitentiary.
Wshington, Sept. 21 An official
account of Villa's raid on Chihuahua
City last Saturday received at the war
department today from Brig. Gen. Bell
at Kl Paso says the bandit chief cap
tured some of Carranza's artillery and
lfi automobile loads of arms and am
munition, liberated 200 prisoners
fiom the penitentiary and made off af
ter being joined by from 14,000 to 14,
500 soldiers of the Carranza garrison.
According to Gen Bell s Information
Villa himself went to the governor's
palace and made a speech from the
balcony after lilS forces had captured
the palace, the penitentiary and feder
al buildings.
The report reveals the fact that on
September 14 Villa sent a letter to
Gen. Trevino, commander at Chihua
hua, saying he would be in the city
at 3 p. m. Saturday to "shake hands."
Gen Bell expresses the opinion that
the raid was completely, successful
and that Villa accomplished even more
than he said he would. Trevino's per
sonal guard deserted him it appears
and in the confusion many govern1
ment soldiers were killed by their
own comrades.
Gen. Bell's dispatch does not show
the source of his information and
many otllcials believe it was founded
on border tumors. Reports received
previously conflicted as to the part
Villa played not even agreeing that lie
was present.
MONTENEGRIN SOLDIER LOST
Tnrough Ticket Agent's Mistake Was
Sent to Burlington.
Burlington has been visited by a
real live Montenegrin soldier, though
to look at the 17-year-old boy. wan
and emaciated, with a part of one
finger gone (from a bit of shrapnel)
one would not believe that he had
served 18 months in the defense of
his country, that little sovereign state
that is practically wiped out of exls
tence In the great struggle for world
power, says The Burlington News.
There Isn't much in a name, per
haps, but a mistake of a New York
ticket clerk sent John Popovlteh to
Burlington, Vt., instead of to Kast
Harrington. Mass., his destination.

tion until some time today. Mr. Wood
said that the situation in the General
electric and spinners' strikes is very
promising and that the next 24 hours
ought to bring about some changes.
Both members of the state board
were in conference with both sides in
the two strikes yesterday, but at no
time were conferences held with both
sides present. A meeting in the Gen
eral electric situation is scheduled for
today.
The union leaders yesterday made
no statement as to tho number of men
at work other than to say that no
more "teal mechanics" had returned to
work and that many were leaving the
city. The company's official statement
said conditions were much improved
yesterday, that there were 2730 at
work, of whom 1901 were of the pro
ducing force and 829 of the office
lorcc.
The strike at the plant will not pre
vent employes with militia companies
on the border from receiving their
weekly pay. The company will live
up to its asreemuut with the soldiers,
which was to give them full pay for
three months and half pay for the rest
of their stay on the border. Lieut
Harry Sheldon of the recruiting office
has been informed that owing to tho
strike employes of the company who
enlist now will receive no compensa
tion from the company.
