LEADING PROGRESSIVE
DECLARES FOR HUGHES
Gifford Pinchot. Close Friend of
Roosevelt, shows Weakness of Wil
son. Has Been upon Both Sides
of Most Questions Since Be
coming President.
Philadelphia, Pa., Sept. 7, 191 G.
Editor Times:
It is the duty of every American
citizen to make and support openly
his choice among candidates for the
Presidency. That duty is especially
solemn this year because great events
and great decisions are certain to con
front us during the next Administra
tion. I am writing to give you my
reasons for my own choice.
I am neither a Democrat nor a Re
publican, but a Progressive. Yet,
there being no Progressive nominees,
unless I choose to support n candidate
who can not be elected, I must vote
for either Wilson or Hughes.
For many months after his inaugu
ration, I thought well of President
Wilson, n In many respects I lilted
what he said about what he was going
tl do. He talked well and made ft
good impression. ,' It was only, when
I began to check np. what he said by
what he did that I was forced to
change my view. i
In the end I came to $ee that Presi
dent Wilson has a greater power than
any other man 'in public life to say
one thing but do another, and get
away with it. .
The facts which justify this state
ment are common knowledge.
We have all heard him tell Germany
publicly that 6he would be held to
strict accountability; and have learn
ed afterward that he had actually let
her know secretly at the time, by the
month of his Secretary of State
through the Austrian Ambassador,
that what he said he did not mean.
Wc have all seen him prove that he
did not mean it by his total failure to
exact reparation, apology, or even dis
avowal for the murder of Americans
on the Lusitnnia.

FOR STATE WIDE PROHIBITION
AGAINST SMALLER UNIT SYSTEM
South Venice Fanners' Club Hits the
"Wets" Hard. No Use for
"Home Rule."
The members of the South Venice
Farmers' Club together with a large
number of friends from different parts
of the county were royally entertain
ed at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Floyd
Owen in Venice township, Thursday
afternoon, guests to the number of 130
being present. The regular program
of the afternoon was shortened to give
time for a full discussion upon the
two constitutional amendments to be
voted upon at the November election,
E. O. Dewey, Rev. B. G. Mattson and
L. F. Miner, of Owosso, leading in the
same. After some remarks by others
the followingresolutions were adopted
by a rising vote, which was practically
unanimous so far as the voters pres
ent were concerned as but one man
failed to vote:
Whereas, Two constitutional amend
ments vitally affecting the welfare of
the people of Michigan are to be voted
upon at the election on November 7th,
the first proposed by the combined
dry forces of the state making possi
ble state-wide prohibition; the second
proposed by the wet interests under
the misnomer of "home rule" would
make possible saloons in counties now
dry by giving the smaller unit of
township, village and city the privi
lege of voting saloon licenses, those
permitting these small units to force
the selling of liquor in counties which
would otherwise be saloonless if the
county vas the unit as provided by
the present local option law.
Whereas, The members of the South
Venice Farmers' Club believe state
wide prohibition would result in un
told good and in increasing happiness
in the homes of Michigan, it is
Kcsolveu, that as individuals we
pledge our efforts to promote all en
deavors made to secure the adoption
of the State Wide Prohibition amend
inentrr.lt is "also further,--Resolved,
That we consider the sa
loon a nuisance in any community and
detrimental to the advancement of the
people along any good line, and with
this as our sentiment we will put
forth every effort to defeat the at
tempt of the wets to deceive the vot
ers with their smaller unit scheme. Fi
nally it is
Resolved, That wc ask the voters of
Shiawassee county to vote "yes on
State Wide Prohibition and "no" on
so-called "home rule."
From Booze to Milk.
The American Magazine tells how
some of the great industries in this
country, recognizing that a man who
drinks beer or whisky is not a good
workman and is more liable to acci
dents than one whj decs not drink,
are trying to win then away from that
habit by getting them to drink milk
instead.
The lllinios Steel company, employ
ing thousands of m.-is, has put electric
signs throughout in ph'.uts asking this
question: "Did booze ever do you
any good help you to y;et a better
job contribute to the happiness of
youi family?"
Other signs notify men that the
company does not vanc ihein to drink
beer or whiskey and warns them that
if they persist in it they will lose their
jobs. The company sends men
through the plant selling milk at cost
in the hope that it will be drunk in
stead of liquors.
The West Steel Casting Company,
of - Cleveland, has put refrigerators
throughout its plant and keeps them
filled with fresh, cold milk, which the
men can buy at cost. The men used
to go to saloons to eat their noon
luncheon. Now they eat it out doors
in the shade and drink milk with it.
The South Works plant of the Illi
nois Steel Company began selling milk
to its workmen at cost six months ago;
It sells fourteen hundred quarts a
day. Fourteen saloons near the plant
were forced to close for lack of traae.
Best of all, the men in all those
plants have learned that milk gives
invigorating and lasting strength and
they have noticed a great benefit in
the change from booze to milk. Kan
sas City Star.
The same is true in some of the fac
tories in this city. In 'one of the
iron-working plants the milk dealers
find ready sale daily for a large quan
tity of milk and not a few of the em- j
ployees admit that the change from
beer to milk has proven beneficial.
Judge Bush Saturday made an or-1
dcr committing Mary Oswald, wife of
Tony Oswald, of Hazelton township,
to the state hospital at Pontiac. ,
