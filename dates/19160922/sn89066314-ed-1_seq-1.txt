BOB SIMPSON LEAVES
FOR SWEDISH GAMES
Bosworth Flyer Given Ova
tion by M. U. Students
at Train.
IN GOOD CONDITION
Will Perform In. New York
With A.A.U. Team-mates
Before Embarking.
"Bys, I nope yot have the hest
football team eer this fall and I
hope to get back to see you lick Kan
sas. Good-bye, fellows."
These few words, probably the
longest talk ever made by the modest
Bosworth athlete, were his farewell
to the three hundred enthusiastic
Tiger followers, who were at last
night's train .to sec Bob off on his
European trip.
Cheers and yells for the hurdler
brought no response until just as the
train was ready to leave the station.
Then Lue Lozier, president of the stu
dent body, asked Bob for a few fare
well remarks-
The news Simpson's leaving Co
lumbia was known around the cam
pus but a few hours. Bob was moved
at the tribute of the students but with
his usual modesty showed up at the
station only a few minutes before
train time and then rushed about,
trying to avoid notice. He nearly
succeeded in getting on the train
without attracting much attention. A
few friends stopped him and, before
he could get away, nearly all the
crowd had taken him by the hand and
wished him luck on his journey.
Coach Schulte who has had charge
of his training, accompanied Simpson
as far as Centralia.
Simpson had not expected to leave
Columbia until Saturday hut a tele
gram yesterday from A. A. U. of
ficials requested him to be in New
York Saturday to take part in some
exhibition track and field events at
Traver's Island. The Missouri ath
lete will arrive in New York Satur
day morning at 10:30 o'clock and will
hae only a few hours' rest before the
games in the afternoon.
Loomis, Murray, Meredith, Simpson
and others will go through their
paces for the New Yorkers. The four
mentioned will leave for Europe on
September 2S. They will take part
In invitation meets under the auspices
of the royalty of three different coun
tries, Sweden, Denmark and Norway.
The meets are scheduled for October
12, 14 and 21-
Simpson was in good condition
when he left last night. His legs
are in fair shape again and if the
long trip does not tire him he will he
ready for more record-breaking per
formances. That he can take care of
himself was shown by his work at
Newark, when he defeated the three
Callfornlans In the high hurdle event.
Tiger fans have faith in his ability
an.1 ccn.iiti-n for the events in Eu
rope. IV. L. H0R' COMMITS SUICIDE

tralia. committed suicide by drinking

his wife several months ago. This is
believed to be the reason for his act
Mr. Horn drank two ounces of car
bolic acid at his brother's home and
died a few minutes later. He left a
note to his children in which he said

WAS A "COLT MIXED IJf THIS!
Visitor's pipe Wounded When Wagon
Wheel Explodes Cartridge.
Instead of a scar or wound, J. W.
Clayton of Slater, Mo., today is dis
playing a pipe as proof that he was
shot at in broad daylight on one of
Columbia's main streets. According
to Clayton's story, if the "shooting"
scrape ever gets Into the courts there
will be three exhibits. Exhibit A will
be a wagon wheel for the wagon
wheel was the cause of the shooting.
Exhibit B will be a smashed .22 cali
ber cartridge the instrument by
which the damage was done. Exhibit
C will be a scarred "Jimmy pipe" for
it was really the pipe and not Clayton
that was shot. There will be no gun
shown and no prisoner will be on the
stand. '
Here's .the way Clayton tells the
yarn:
"I came over here today to testify
in a case. This morning I was talk
ing to a friend near the east end of
the courthouse. I heard a sharp re
port and then something hit me at
least I thought it had hit me though
it really hit my pipe. I have been
hit many times in the face but never
with such force. A wagon had run
over a cartridge, it had exploded and
the bullet hit my pipe. No, it didn't
hurt the pipe or me either."
Impossible things have happened in
Columbia before but, well It will
make a good story to tell the folks
at home anyway.

other of his short speeches today,
Charles Evans Hughes went a trifle
further than heretofore in warning
organized labor of the dangers of sur
rendering the principle of arbitration,
as evidenced, he said, in the Adamsonl
bill. .
"The time is not far distant," he
added, "when American railroad com
panies refused arbitration and then
sought in vain for that sort of settle
ment of their controversy. And now
it is no friendship to labor it is not a
friendly act to labor to dispense with
that principle."

GERMANS WILL SEEK
RACE, ALLIES THINK
Move For Armistice to Come
in October Through Spain
or United States.
LOSS HASTENS PLAN
British G.iin Trenches in
West Bulgars Defeated
in Balkan Region.
By United Press.
' LONDON, Sept. 22. Germany will
set another peace kite flying about
the middle of October, British official
dom conEdently expects-
Recent apparently authenticated
rumors ahve reached London that
Germany, suffering huge losses be
cause of the recent Allied offensive,
is endeavoring to suggest an armis
tice through Spain or the United
States. It Is understood from reliable
authorities that King Alphonso so far
is' not interested.
The Germans, it is believed here,
hope to tempt President Wilson to
start negotiations at the time when
any attendant success would be llke
lytaraffect favorably his chances of
re-election,
Americans conversant with British
sentiment feel certain that any such
move on the part of Washington
would only be foredoomed to failure.
It would also arouse the bitter re
sentment of the Allies. It would per
manently eliminate Washington as a
possible mediator.
Every indication points not only
to the unity of purpose of the Allies
to continue the war until a decisive
peace is obtainable but to the fact
that the army and navy and political
leaders are thoroughly united In the
determination to assume responsibili
ty, if necessary, for the war's con
tinuation after Germany is willing to
quit
I this does become necessary they.
will leave It to history to justify the
additional carnage in the interests of
the removal of the menace of mili
tarism. It is no secret that the Anglo
French are prepared, both in numbers
and in munitions, to continue the
present offensive Indefinitely, regard
less of the winter weather.

prevailed.
There was light to heavy frost last night
In Colorado, and Nebraska, and thence
northwestward to Alberta; but generally
the prevailing temperatures approximate
the pleasant autumn type.

The ease with which the first Rus-so-Rumanian
attacks were beaten
back, and the fact that the Russians

Germans, Austrians and
Turks who were taken from the

Germans Sink Ally Troop Transport.
By Cnlted Tress.
BERLIN, Sept. 22. A German sub
marine sunk an enemy transport
loaded to capacity with troops, in the
Mediterranean on September 17, it
was officially announced today. The
transport sunk within forty-three sec
onds. The Berlin statement made no men
tion of the fate of the soldiers aboard
the transport Accepting the state
ment that the transport went down in
forty-three seconds as true, it appears
probable that few if any persons were
rescued unless other vessels were in
the immediate vicinity.

After
Meeting of Leaders.

NEW YORK, Sept. 22. Whether a
general walk-out of upwards of 800,
000 workers in New York is to be
called in support of the striking em
ployes oMhetraction companies rest
ed late today on the result of a con
ference of the representatives of the
sixty-five labor unions of the city.
The labor leaders went into session
late this afternoon. The sentiment as,
to what entered the secret meeting
seemed to favor a strong vote to aid
the car men in their strike, which the
leaders said involves the right to or
ganize. A majority of the leaders apparent
ly will favor union men and women in
a score of trades, showing their sym
pathy with the car men by remaining
away from work until the traction
trouble is satisfactorily settled. The
only question appeared to be whether
the walk-out would not take the form
of a strike or boycott of the car lines.
