ed, Says II. C. Bowman-
I nsanity in Kansas has increased
more than 108 per cent in seventeen
years, while the population of the
state has increased slightly more than
1 7 per cent in the same period. That
is a statement made today by Harry
. Bowman, member of the state
hoard of control, and is based on
official figures.
Decided increases in the birth rate
among mentally dencient anu a uik 1
decrease in the birth rate in normal
families is given by Bowman as an j
explanation of the startling snowing.
The J-Sownian statement, which is to
)u- made a part of the official report
of the board, shows that since June
30, 1 the number of insane and
feeble-minded persons in state in
stitutions has increased from 1.984 to
4.1 4M. an increase of 2.156. or slightly
more than 108 per cent.
Two cw Institutions.
In the seventeen-year period, two
new state institutions have been es
tablished by the state for the care of
insane and mentally deficient. Even,
the new institutions have been unable
to care for the increase. All state in-j
stit utions are now crowded, and all i
state charities are demanding that the
legislature provide additional quar
ters and facilities for the care of the
state's mentally sick.
Kstablishment of the Parsons and
T.arned hospitals has not stopped
heavy increases in population at To
peka. Osawatomie and Lamed hospi
tals. The Parsons and Lamed hos
pitals now care for 638 patients, while
the population at the Winfield hospi
tal has increased more than 400 per
cent.
Topeka and Osawatomie hos-
. pilars, have. made. big, .ga ins In.
population. In 1899 the Topeka
hospital cared for 827 patients.
The report for the biennoum end
ing June 30, shows 1,565 patients,
f s iwatomie in 1899 cared for 1,019
patients, with a population this year
of 1,348. Winfield state hospital in
cared for 138 patients. It now
has u population of 589. Parsons hos
pital, established since 1899, now
cares for 525 men and women, while
the new Larned hospital has a total
of 1 13 inmates.
All C harities Crowded.
Ueports received by the state board
of control show all state charities
crowded. Returns today from the To
poka and Osawatomie hospitals show
crumped conditions. There are quar-tei-
for hut two femalt; inmates. Xo
additional women patients can be
cared for at Osawatomie. Kvery bed
is taken.
To meet the situation, plans are be
ins; worked out to send twenty-five
feeble minded women inmates of the
Topeka hospital to Winfield. Ite
cently a new building was completed
at Winfield. This change will permit
the state to at least temporarily meet
the demands for admission of insane
patients.

Conscription in Crisis.
for
nsider It Loyal Duty in Case
of Australia.
Chicago, Sept. 22. American worn
, if faced with the question of vut
g on conscription, would put aside
wr fears and cast their ballots to
traversal military service, according
o two prominent suffrage leaders here
oday who commented on the prob
blo action of Australian Women who
ill shortly vote with the men on con
ription. "The women of this country, in a
isis similar to En gland's, would I
link, vote for conscription," said Miss
la rriet Vittum, western manager of
he Woman's Bureau of the Republi
can national committee today. "Ens
land needs be men and I think there
will be no doubt that wnmjn of Aus
'rulia will vote for conscription. They
vil I be as loyal to fOngland as the
'omen of Engiand are."
Mrs. Geo. Bass, director of the
oman's bureau for the .Democratic
nominee said: "I cannot tell what
he women of Australia will do. What
he women of the United States would
o is a rather far-fetched question. If
.-e were in war it would be a long time
rfore we would be forced to conscrip
ion for we would have regulars,
guardsmen and volunteers enough to
ivoid conscription, I think. However,
a tight for our country's existence
would develop a passionate loyalty
hat would cause our women to put
iside a woman's natural love for
peace."

puerto Plata, Santo Domingo, Sept.
22. Crujie oil that had been thrown
overboard by Uncle Sam's warships to
quell the rasing waters which destroy

the recent storm, stuck to the wings
of sea gulls and other water fowl tak
ing refuge in the bays along the coast,
and rendered them helpless and un
able to fly for several days.
Members of the United States mar
ine corps, on expeditionary duty at this
place, captured hundreds of th birds
with their hands.
The oil-begrimed fowls wandered up
and down on the beach, crying piti

"Walter Roscoe Stubbs will stump

been tendered Charles Sessions, chair
man of the Republican state commit
tee. The former governor will be
booked for a number of speeches by
the state committee during October
and the week preceding the November
election.
j Stubbs. who went away with the
Progressive movement in 1912, is now
: back in the Republican party with
I both feet. He has, declared that the
interests of the country demand the
election of Charles K. Hughes to the
presidency and the success of Repub
lican congressional candidates and the
Republican state ticket. He has of
fered his services in any section of the
state where he may do effective work.
For years Stubbs held a strong grip
on the voters in western Kansas. Be
cause of his following in the western
counties it is probable that the former
governor will he used extensively in
the Sixth and Seventh districts. Red

KILL BRITISH SUBJECTS
Bandits Also Slay 36 Carranzista Sol
diers, in Oil Camp Raid.
Galveston, Sept. 22. The killing of
two British subjects and thirty-six of
a party of thirty-eight Carranzista
soldiers at an oil camp of the Aquila
company near Tuxpama on September
16 by bandits, is the news brought
here on the steamship Topila just in
from Tamplco.
The bandits, the report says, called
themselves Villistas. It was reported
at Tampico that the Carranza sol
diers put up a hard fipht but were
outnumbered and overpowered.
The report adds that two of the
Carranza officers took refuge in the
house of an Englishman. They were
discovered there nd put to death and
two British subjects were killed for
having sheltered the Mexicans.
GERMAN PEACE
KITE WILL FLY
SOONISREPORT
Huge Losses From Allied Offen
siye Jar Entire Nation.
May Suggest Armistice Thru
Spain or America.
ALLIES WON'T LISTEN TO IT
Declare They Will Fight War to
Decisive Peace.
Removal of Menace of Militar
ism Is Big Effort.
London, Sept. 22. Germany will set
another peace kite flying about the
middle of October, British officialdom,
both military and civil, confidently
expects.
Recent apparently well authenti
cated rumors have reached London
that Germany, suffering huge losses
because of the recent allied offensive,
is endeavoring to suggest an armis
tice thru Spain or the United States.
It is understood on reliable au
thority that King Alfonso so far is
unresponsive and is unlikely to act.
The Germans, it is believed here, hope
to tempt President Wilson to start
negotiations at the time when any at
tendant success would be likely to
effect favorably his chances of re
election. Americans conversant with inside
British sentiment, feel certain that
any such move on the part of Wash
ington would not only be foredoomed
to failure, but would arouse the most
bitter resentment of the allies and
also permanently eliminate Washing-
ion as a possioie mediator.
Every indication points not only to
the oneness of purpose of all the
allies to continue the war until a
decisive peace is obtainable, but to the
fact that the army, the navy and
political leaders are thoroly united in
the determination to assume respon
sibility, if necessary, for the war's con
tinuation after Germany is willing to
quit. If this does become necessary,
they will leave it to history to justify
the additional carnage in the interest
of the removal of the menace of
militarism.
Allies Are Prepared.
It is no secret that the Anglo-French
are prepared both in numbers and
tensive indefinitely regardless of win
ter. Altho there was much nervous
ness a year ago when any definite
peace proposals from Germany on a
basis merely of abandonment of the
occupied territory might have been
considered sympathetically by the
military authorities in view of the real
precariousness of the situation, they
feel that now everything favors the
allies and that such an abandonment
of occupied territory would only be to
Germany's advantage, enabling her to
shorten and strengthen her lines.
British soldiers' only worry now is
possible over-optimism of civilians be
cause of their receut successes and
those confidently expected in the fu
ture. They realize that the Germans
are not yet beaten and that a long and
arduous task confronts them.
CHARGEJPERJURY
Bankrupt Millionaire's Attor
ney Held to Grand Jury.
Reputed Father of Adopted
Girls Also Ordered Held.
Chicago, Sept. 22. James H. Ward,
attorney for Edward W. Morrison, an
alleged millionaire bankrupt, was
ordered held to the grand Jury by
Federal Judge Landis today on
charges of perjury. Ward has come
into possession of $2,100,000 of prop
erty owned by Morrison, whose van
ishing millions have been a subject
of inquiry before Judge Landis.
Joseph Burnstein, a junk dealer,
reputed father of two girls Morrison
recently adopted, was also held to the
grand jury on a charge of perjury.
Burnstein had testified that his wife
made a deathbed confession that the
83-year-old millionaire was the real
father of the two girls
Judge Scores Attorney Ward.
After reviewing discrepancies in
Ward's testimony Judge Landis criti
cized Ward and Bernstein severely.
"The wells of perjury have never
been so firmly touched as in this
case," he said.
Edward Harris, former stenograph
ed of Ward's and John Sommers, a
jeweler who said Morrison had spent
$200,000 with him in the red light dis
trict, were held on bonds of $2,500 ar
witnesses. Judge Landis advised
State's Attorney Hoyne to begin in
vestigations at once to prosecute Ward
and Bernstein.
Dramatic Scene in Court.
Bernstein was recalled to the stand
today and repeated his story adding
that he told Morrison of his wife's con
fession at the funeral. Morrison was
called to the stand and pointing his
finger at Bernstein, denounced him as
a liar.

Will Call Out Militia if General
Strike Is Called.
Sympathetic Walkout Law ATio

STATE BOARD BACKS DOWN

Set for Monday.
May Substitute Boycott for the
General Strike.
New Tork, Sept. 22. The plan an
nounced yesterday by M. J. Kegan of
the state board of arbitration and me
diation to enforce arbitration was tem
porarily abandoned today and the
hearing which he announced would be
held Monday has been postponed. The
question will be taken up, it was an
nounced, at a meeting of the state in
dustrial commission Tuesday.
Xew York, Sept. 22. New York's
labor troubles reached their most
critical stage today. Before nightfall
there will be a break either one way
or the other. Facing the warning of
Mayor Mitchel that he will call out
the militia in the event of a general
strike in sympathy with the striking
street railway men, labor leaders went
in session to finally consider whether
700,000 organized workers shall be
called out.
Characterizing a sympathetic strike
as' "violative of the laws," Mayor
Mitchel has warned the labor leaders
that he will use all of the "military
and civil power vested in the mayor"
to cope with such a situation. Backed
by Samuel Gompers, labor leaders
stoutly maintain that they will stick
by their fight for the right to organize
and claim that the struggle is on trade
unionism and is vital to the welfare
of all organized labor. Gompers, in
conferenc- with Mayor Mitchel, gave
unmistakable evidence that he will
support the local leaders in whatever
action they decide to follow.
Fso Boycott Weapon.
While the consideration of a general
strike was under way, it was learned
that many labor leaders suggest a
general boycott on the street railway
as; a. more effective weapon... .Ihe.plam
oi mese leaaers is 10 oraer ail umn:
men to stay away from- their work
until "proper transportation" is pro
vided. They maintain tha this will
be a more peaceful and effective
method of settling the difficulties than
a general strike.
Meanwhile normal operation of the
subway and elevated lines has been
maintained. Intermittent disorders in
various parts of the cities kept the
police busy during the night and early
morning but no serious disorders were
reported. Partial night- service on
cross town lines was maintained for
the first time with heavy police
details.
Virions Will Not Stn'render.
Undaunted by the warning of the
mayor, Hugh Frayne, state organizer
of the American Federation of Labor,
said today:
"Trade unionists will not surrender
their rights to organize in this city. '
This was Frayne's parting shot as
he went into the conference which
will decide whether a general strike
will be called.
"We have made no threats of dis
order," Frayne said, "and we cannot
be held responsible for disorder. ' We
have advised against it and shall so
continue to advise."
6,700 Policemen on Job.
Mayor Mitchel's notice that he
stood ready to invoke all the civil and
military power at hi command to
suppress disorder was followed by
greater police activity and with a
warning that persons convicted of en
gaging in strike riots would receive
heavier punishment. Thus far 6,700
policemen have been disposed at stra
tegic points. Some of the labor lead
ers said such a strike, if ordered.
would begin Monday or Tuesday.
Renew Bombardments on Cars.
New York, Sept. 22. The early
morning bombardments of elevated
trains were resumed, strike sympa
thizers lurking on roof tops throwing
bricks and bottles which shattered car
windows. Several passengers were in
jured in sixteen attacks reported by
the police.

Chihuahua City, Sept. 22. Com
menting on the reports in American
newspapers attributed to Gen. George
Bell, jr., at El Paso, of the Villa raid
upon this city last Saturday, Gen.
Jacinto Trevino, commanding the Car
ranza army of the north, today issued
a statement to the Associated Press in
which he described it as "a tissue of
lies and falsehoods."
"I am at a loss to know where Gen
eral Bell obtained such bad informa
tion." he continued. "The. Villistas i
carried absolutely nothing away with
them except some of the prisoners
from the penitentiary, many of whom
have since returned here. They cap
tured neither ammunition, cannon nor
anything else.
Villa Had 800 Men.
"Our artillery drove the Villistas out
of the places which they had taken,
and pursued them in their hasty re
treat with shelis, leaving them no time
to carry anything away as they left,
galloping in small groups thru the
narrow streets of the town."
General Trevino asserted that every
unit of his force was co-ordinated;
that all prisoners examined by him
agreed that Villa's band did not num
ber more than 600; that there were no
desertions from the garrison, and that
all, of the automobiles in the city are
accounted for, none being carried
away by the outlaws. Government
artillery fire was only ceased, he Bald,
when the bandits had been repulsed
and there seemed danger of hitting
the pursuing forces under Generals
Ramos and Merriero.
Baker Doubts Bell Report.
Washington. Sept. 22. Secretary
Baker let it be known" todajr that- the
war department was not disposed to
accept as accurate the report of Villa's
raid on Chihuahua City last Saturday,
transmitted by Brigadier General Bell
yesterday on the strength of informa
tion that had reached him in El Paso.
"We have no military information
as to renewed Villista activities," Mr.
Baker said. Indicating that it was as
sumed that General Bell's account
was based upon rumors and reports
current in border towns and not facts
obtained thru army channels in Mex
ico. He declined to discuss in any
way what effect the reappearance of
Villa, if ?t were confirmed, might
have on the movement of American
troops in Mexico.
Trevino Ienies Defeat.
New York, Sept. 22. In a telegram
today to Juan T. Burns, Mexican con
sul general in Xew York, General
Trevino after reiterating his statement
that his forces defeated the Villa in
vaders at Chihuahua City, says:
"This foolish shedding of blood was
with the intention of creating diffi
culties for the conferees of the com
mission at New London and the
machinations of American and Mex
ican political interests. They them

London, Sept. 22. Under heavy
Husso-Rumanian hammer blows, the
Teutonic forces in Dobrudja have
fallen back more than five miles, and
are still In retreat, said Bucharest dis
patches today. An earlier official
statement reported the Bulgarians
burning villages and ravaging the
country as they fell back.
The official statement also reported
the capture of Szekely Udvarhely, an
industrial town of about 8.000 inhabi-
tants,
forty-five miles inside the
Transylvanian frontier. Sofia dis
patches today admitted that the Ger-man-BuIgar
attacks against the
Russo-Rumanian line have been un
successful and that the Rumanians
have gained a little ground at some
points. An official statement issued
at Sofia made no mention of a Bul
garian retirement, but reported that
the Bulgars are consolidating their
positions in the Dobrudja.
Renew Stress on Greece.
The defeat of Field Marshal' Mack
ensen in the Dobrudja invasion and
the check administered to the Austro
Germans on the northwestern frontier
of Rumania have caused a renewal of
the demand here for a settlement of
affairs at Athens.
. It is no longer a secret that the new
Greek cabinet is not regarded as
favorable to the allies; English cor
respondents at Athens cabled today
that it was highly improbable that the
allies would be able to enter into
cordial relations with the new min
istry. Reports have reached here that
the revolts which have broken out in
isolated parts, of Greece 'may mean the
beginning of a real revolution headed
by ex-Premier Venizelos to overthrow
King Constantine and bring Greece
into the war.

Paris, Sept. 22. The Bulgarians
