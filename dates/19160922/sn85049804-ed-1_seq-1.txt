Miss Davis, en route to the National
Baptist convention in Savannah, Ga.,
a few days agwv.made a flying trip to
Centerville and spent two days in at
tendance at the Iowa Baptist associa
tion in session at that place. Miss
Davis had been an ardent worker and
held several prominent offices in this

welcoming one of their own who had
made good in the great national field
as well as at home.
Miss Davis has consented to return

assisting the local churches through
out the state by a lecture tour.
EDITOR'S OBSERVATIONS.
In our last week's observations we
forgot tp give the names of the differ
ent automobile routes or,trails (as
they are called) that we traveled over.
They were as follows: The Great
White Way, River, to River Road, the
C. C. K. G, the Lincoln Highway,
Black Diamond. These routes or trails
are of immense value to autoists, as
they silently mark the route to the
next town and distance and also give
you the danger zones.
Oskaloosa, Iowa, being our first
real stop Tuesday morning, Septem
ber 5th. Here we found this quiet
Quaker town moving along in its us
ual conservative course with her 300
colored people doing fairly well. Alex
Clark, Jr., is still In the tonsorial busi
ness, with Mr. R. E. Moore assisting
him. He is a graduate from the law
department of Iowa State university.

Hardy is still working at his business.
He is a reliable citizen. His only

about two years. He is in the coal
and ice business for himself and has

best white people. His son assists
him. He came from Keokuk and we
bespeak for Mr. Wood a successful
business man. He is a true race man.
Go on, Mr. Woods. Mrs. Hannah Wil
liams is still keeping roomers. Robt.
Johnson, our genial friend, still works
for the Standard Oil Co.—a very re
sponsible position. His able wife is
