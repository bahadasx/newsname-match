Funston However Inclined to Think
Report Has a Good
Foundation
(Associated Press)
Washington, Sept. 22. Secretary
Baker let it be known today that the
war department was not disposed to
accept as accurate -General Bill's re
port of yesterday on the Villa raid on
Chihuahua City. He indicated the as
sumption that Gen. Bell's account was
based on border rumors and reports
and not on facts obtained through
army channels in Mexico.
FUNSTON CREDITS THE STORY
San Antonio, Sept. 22. Gen. Fun
ston said he placed full credence in
Gen. Bell's report to the war depart
ment on Villa's Chihuahua rail. He
has been informed that Gen. Bell's
information was gained from reliable
persons coming to El Paso direct
from Chihuahua City, immediately af
ter the battle.
TISSUE OF LIES, SAYS TREVINO
Chihuahua City, Sept. 22. General
Trevino in a statement to the Asso
ciated Press described the reports of
the Villa raid attributed to General
Bliss as "a tissue of lies and false
hoods." He said he was at a loss to
know where Gen. Bell got "such a
brand of information."
ON GOOD AUTHORITY
El Paso, Sept. 22. General Bell
said he obtained the information con
cerning the Villa attack on Chihuahua
City from "several most reliable
sources." He said he had every rear
son to believe his report was based on
facts.

CONDITION OF
RANK
Will Try to Prevent Georgia Demo-
cratic Convention from
Endorsing Wilson
Gainesville, Sept. 22. A special
from Atlanta to the Sun says:
Not only is Hugh M. Dorsey, dem
ocratic governor-elect of Georgia.
confronted with a demand from
Thomas E. Watson that the platform
adopted by the Macon convention,
which meets next Tuesday, shall con
tain no indorsement of President
Woodrow Wilson or of the democratic
administration in Washington, but he
is confronted with the further demand
than the democratic state convention
in Macon shall actually condemn the
president and the democratic Con
gress.
Perhaps never before in the historv
of the democrats in Georgia has such
a situation presented itself. Here is
a democratic governor-elect, nominat
ed by democrats in a democratic pri
mary, .about to be formally nominated
by a democratic convention, com
manded by the arch enemy of his
party in Georgia to condemn the
party's national leader and the par
ty's administration of the affairs of
the national government.
Condemnation of Wilson, condem
nation of the democratic Congress, is
what Watson demands. If he can't
get that, he demands that the Macon
convention, at the very least, shall in
clude no indorsement of Wilson or of
the democratic Congiess in its plat
form. Such a thing as an affirmative
indorsement of Wilson or of Congress
is absolutely out of the question, so
far as Watson is concerned. Hi3
wrath would know no bounds if the
democratic convention should dare to
violate his orders to that extent,
judging by the language of his edi
torials in the latest issue of "The
Jeeffrsonian."
What will Dorsey do?
What will his friends do?
There is Albert Howell Jr., some
times known as "Little Albert," law
partner of Hugh Dorsey and brains
of his campaign. Mr. Howell's broth
er, Clark Howell, is democratic na
tional committeeman from Georgia.
The Atlanta Constitution, of which
Clark Howell is editor and Albert
Howell president, has supported Wil
son consistently. Certain it is, there
fore, that Albert Howell will not con
sent to a refusal to indorse Wilson,
much less to condemnation of his ad
ministration.
Ther is J. R. Smith of Atlanta,
president of . the Fulton County Hugh
Dorsey Club, prospective chairman of
the resolutions and platform commit
tee of the Macon convention, as strong
a supporter of Woodrow Wilson. Cer
tain it is that J. R. Smith will not
consent to slapping Woodrow Wilson
in the face.
Yet Watson's orders are clear, tin
mistakable, emphatic and peremptory,
He asserts that the governor-elect
was not a democratic candidate, that
the primary was not a democratic
primary, that the convention will not
be a democratic convention, that the
nomination to be conferred by the
convention will not be a democratic
nomination.
Republicans, progressives, social
ists, every stripe and color except ne
groes, participated in t the primary,
asserts Watson, "and therefore it
would be ungrateful, indecent and
even brutal to slap those men in the
face with a Wilson indorsement,
which has no business in this (the
Macon), convention."

Many Were Present at the Event and
Great Interest was
I Manifct
What is perhaps the largest water
contest ever held at Silver Springs
was witnessed at that natural cool
yesterday afternoon by a crowd of
fully 500 persons. It is estimated
that at least 150 automobiles were
parked at the springs during the con
test. The afternoon was a delightful
one, clear and bracing, and the sports
were thoroughly enjoyed.
The entries were numerous and the
swimming and diving was spirited.
R. S. Hall Jr. captured three con
tests. He won in the 100-yard dash. '
in the 440-yard dasrnand the dive for
form. The prize for the 100-vard
dash was a handsome Stetson hat
donated by H. A. Waterman, the prize
for the 440-yard contest a nifty shirt,
presented by the Commercial Bank.
and the prize for the dive was another
nifty shirt presented by the s?me
bank. Miss Clifton Sexton ;vas win
ner of the 25-yard dash for girls un
der 12 years of age, and was present
ed with a season ticket for bathing
for 1917. Miss Cornelia Dozier car
ried off the prize for the best dive
for girls under 12 vears of ave ihf
. ( -ct -t
prize being a season ticket. Miss
Blair Woodrow won the 500-yard dash
for girls under 21 years of age, and
was presented with a season ticket.
The 50-yard swim for boys under 21
was won by Mr. Coon, the prize being
a box of socks and two ties, presented
by the Commercial Bank. Inhe 440-
yard dash for girls under 21 there
were three participants: Miss Blair
Woodrow, Miss Gladys Drake and
Miss Marguerite Moore. Miss Moore
won the event. She is the daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. J. T. Moore, of this
city, and it will be remembered that
she was recently successful in swim
ming contests in Tampa. Miss Drake
finished second, and Miss Woodrow
did not finish. ' -
The judges of the contests were
Messrs. B. F. Condon, Sam Leigh and
J. T. Moore. Mr. Harry Elpert was
starter.
Mr. Ed Carmichael is making a
move in the right direction in pro
moting contests of this kind at the
springs. His efforts to make Silver
Springs a popular summer and win
ter watering place deserve encourage-
ment. This season the springs have
been more popular than they have
been for many a year. Mr. Harry El
pert, who has been acting as life
guard at the springs, is a swimmer of
experience, and he has co-operated
with Mr. Carmichael in a splendid
manner. It has become a common
thing to see parties going to the
springs for a plunge before break
fast.
