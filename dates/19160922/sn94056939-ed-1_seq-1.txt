The Record of McDonald'
letter written January 19, 1914
more than ten months before the
bank failed, in which ho ncknow
ledged receipt of the McCarty
report showing the bank to be
insolvent, shows that ho then
wrote:
I quite well understand the
importance of this caso and have
already taken it up with the
Traveling Auditor. Some action
will be taken very shortly to
ward an adjustment that will put
the bank in better shape if it is
possible to accomplish that pur
pose. I assure you I appreciate
your full statement of the case,
as it gives me abetter understand
ing than I have ever had before.
This matter has been up for some
time nnd I hope fore a satisfac
tory solution or arrangement very
shortly."

willing to
stand on his Record.

THE PEOPLES' CHOICE
FOR U.S. SENATOR
A. Hubbell is
Really and
the Hearts
He Seeks
Truly First in
of the People
to Represent
OSSES EVERY QUALIFICATION
FOR OFFICE HE SEEKS
The most noticeable thing about
the candidacy of Frank A. Hub
bell, the Republican nominee for
United States Senator, is that
the campaign in being conducted
solely upon business principles.
Mr. Hubbell is pre-eminently a
business man. He docs not pose
as a professional politician but
wishes to servo his people in the
capacity of a champion before
the national congress for the
commercial advancement of the
Great West of which our own
Now Mexico is so prominent a
part Notwithstanding the fact
of the sincerity oí Mr. Hubbclrs
motives in seeking the high of
fice to which he aspires, he is no
I
HON. FRANK A. HUMEl-L.
novlco in the realm "of politics.
He has held some of the most
responsible county and state of
fices in the gift of the people dur
ing his long career of usefulness
in New Mexico. Twice ho served
terms in the State Senate where
he made a brilliant record as a
legislator. At this all-important
stage in New Mexico's develop
ment along commercial lines, the
state needs just this kind of a
man to represent her interests
at the National Capital, for Mr.
Hubbell is a man of established
business reputation, and one who
docs big tilings, There is, in
fuct, nothing little about the man,
and he seeks this office not for
graft, or other unworthy motive,
for he has accumulated, in his
active business career, plenty of
this world '8 goods. His record
as a banker, merchant stockman
and farmer is too well known,
and he wishes to give his time
and talents to the faithful service
of his consituency. nd asks for
the high position of trust and
responsibility prompted by a de
sire for usefulness and without
greed for personal gain oragran-
d zement.
The campaign which Mr. Hub
ocll is conducting is intensely
active and its scope is absolutely
state-wide. Ho proposes to pre
sent his claims and promises to
every voter in the uttermost nook
and corner of this great state.
He is making his appeal in s
forceful and convincing manner,
His principles are clear-cut and
conclusive and arc bound to pro
duco substantial results before
November 7th passes into history.
As far as Lincoln County is
concerned, it has been shown to
yond a shadow of a doubt that
it is strong for Hubbell and his
C.iAti For Uitfd Swti Sfmiw.
friends and loyal supporters her
as every where, are legion.
His phenomenal strength was
thoroughly manifested when he
completely captured the stale
convention at its recent session
in Santa Fe, and decisively de
feated one of tho strongest men
who ever sat in the national
senate in the iicrson of Thos. B.
Catron. Mr. Hubbell is pressing
his advantage agressiveiy and
will continue to do so until the
final vote is in the ballotbox nnd
the fact of his election is practi
cally established when his uni
versal lwpularity is being re-in-forced
by such an up-to-date and
consistently active campaign.
DEMOCRATIC EFFORTS
AIL IN FIVE COUNTIES
Efforts to Throw Republicans
of Santa Fe County into
Alignment Against State
Ticket Meets Defeat
PLOTS TO DISRUPT MORA
COUNTY QUICKLY ABANDONED
Sants Fe, N. M. Sept. 20: Tre
mendous efforts put forward by
tho Democratic campaign mana
gers, to effect fusion line-ups iu
five New Mexico counties have
failed in every case and failed
with n completeness which has
discouraged the democratic camp
aign manages from futhcr Seri
ous attempts of the kind. The
catastropho to the democratic
fusion Bhcme in Santa Fe county
is now a matter of history. It
was a wreck of plans laid at
great care and with no little pre
liminary expense nnd the wreck
ing was spectacular in the ex
treme. By working on an arous
ed local sentiment concerning
county affairs tho democratic'
campaign managers brouch:
about a strong alignment of in
dependent Republican, progres
sives, etc., with the few demo
crats who live in Santa Fe count. .
They held a convention in the
state capítol and nonominated u
county ticket which is not with
out element of strength. Thus
far the shemo went well.
But the real object of the whole
huge undertaking was to secure
a repudiation by the Independents
o' tho Republican state ticket.
That is the main and only renson
the convention was held. Thus
the two hundred Republican de
legates sitting in the conventioi.
flately refused to do. Col. Uron.
som M. Cutting the ambition
young millionnriro owner of thi
Santa Fe New Mexican, who ns--scrts
himself to be n supporki
of Charles E. Hughes for presi
dent, and who is doing his up
most to defeat Hughes in New
Mexico, made n vehement fight
ngainst the ndoption of resolu
tions unequivocally endorsing
both the national and state Re
publican tickets. He had but
eight votes wiih him and tho re
stitutions as adopted ureas heart
and as loyal to both state a 1
national candidates as the
exneting among them coukt di -sire.
The results of the coi.
vention will be a fight ovoi tl.
local county ticket, with the re gular
Republicans certain of
victory and the normal, or lie
ter Uinn tho normal Ropubli a i
majorities for the national ..ml
state Republcan tickets in S n.
ta Fe county.
In San Miguel county w
emtio fusion plans have u,o i
up without even a loud nolsi.
A. A. Jones has used there, a I
his prayerful eloquence and poi
Riiassivo íwwers nnd tho whole
box of democratic tricks has
been unloosed. The democratic
state organization has done it
best, It has scored another flat
and somewhat ignomlnous failui e
since it has been unable even tu
get a fair start Some small en
couragement had been held out
to the fusion workers prior In
the nomination of E. C. de Baca
for Governor on Governor Mc
Donald's understudy ticket.
But since that time tho bitter
personal opposition to dc Ba.u
in his home county has solidified
Republican lines and has brought
about a democrat indifference
which has rendered further eí
forts in lian Miguel county.
