Mayor Mitchell and Citizens Com­
mittee Fail in Effort to
Avert Strike.
•New York* Sept. 21.—The threaten­
ed general labor strike in sympathy
with the striking street car employes
will be called tomorrow, Ernest
E'ohm, secretary of the Central Fed­
erated union, announced late today,
after a conference between labor
leaders and a citizens' committee,
which both he and Mayor Mitchell
declared had failed irt its effort to
avert the strike.
A communication' from Mayor Mit­
chell, addressed to Hugh Frayne,
chairman of the conference commit­
tees of labor leaders, after a final ef­
fort to arrange a peaceful settle­
ment had failed and following the
declaration that a strike was inevi­
table. The mayor made it plain that
for the union officials "to call the
strike will be to assume full respon
si'bility for all that may follow.
The Communication.
"The mayor, representing the civil
forces of the govenrment in this
city," the letter declared, "feels it de­
pendent. upon him to say to you now
before any further rash steps are tak­
en, that these duties (to enforce law
and maintain order) the city govern­
ment will discharge to the full, em­
ploying its resources to that end.
"Such assaults and crimes of vio
lence, including injury to innocent
citizens, us those of Tuesday and
Wednesday will be suppressed with a
strong hand and punished withh all
the vigor at the command of the gov
ernmenl."
Alleges Breach of Contract.
The communication, which was con­
curred in by Oscar Strauss, chairman
of the public service commission, re­
viewed at length the causes which led
to the present crisis. It stated that
the Interborpugh Rapid Transit com­
pany, which operates the subway and
elevated lines, violated a verbal agree­
ment with the labor leaders by refus­
ing to arbitrate issues arising conse­
quent to the agreement. It stated,
on the other hand, that the employes
of the 'New York Railway company
and the other surface lines affected
by the strike "were guilty of a breach
of contract they had made with their
employers, which ended a tie-up on
the surface roads in July."
The so-called final conference was
attended by Mayor Mitchell, a citi­
zens' committee and the labor lead­
ers. It ended in a deadlock. The
mayor later declared there was "no
solution in sight," while members of
the citizens' committee described the
situation 'as "hopeless,"' adding that
"it would appear that both sides
would have to fight it out."

TAKES DERELICTS AND
MAKES THEM OVER
By STAFF CORRESPONDENT.
Geneva, Switzerland, Sept. 21.—
What do we really know about the
possible and the impossible?
After this war those words ought
to be used with great caution or not
at all. To this mysterious human
race of ours, anything is possible and
nothing is impossible!
Can a group of women run a har­
vesting machine through a wheat field
while deadly shells go flying over
their heads and they never give the
least heed? Not in this world, I
should have said two years ago.
Yet I have seen them do it, three
quarters of a mile back of the French
trenches. From a bomb-proof 1 saw
it. The women didn't have any bomb
proofs. Unexploded shells, I was told,
lay in that field, likely to blow up
if crunched into by a wheel or a
horse's hoof.
People can do anything, and can
adjust themselves to anything.
Here was Switzerland on July 30,
1914, smiling ainl prosperous, hotel
business was boorrng. Take away
her hotel and 'canst trade, it was
said, a'i lead ruin vist fall
upon her.
•In the next two weeks her hotel
and tourist trade was annihilated.
More than half of her hoiels are
closed. But the Country lives on,
and there is no widespread or other
kind of ruin.
Other industries besides hotel keep­
ing are prostrate. There isn't an
inch of Swiss frontier that doesn't
face a fighting country and among
all these giants drunk with war,
poor Switzerland, clinging with nails
and teeth to blessed neutrality, is
squeezed to business suffocation.
Thousands of worker are in the
army that Switzerland must keep day
and night on guard around her bor­
ders. The government is feeding and
clothing them. But it is a small coun­
try and not rich. The expenses are
great and the debts are piling up.
But Switzerland still lives and so
do the Swiss people.
Live? Why, stricken with the par­
alysis of this sacred and indispen­
sable thing we call business they go
on and give to the world a wonder­
ful and moving example of generosity.
The one bright spot in this lurid, sul­
phurous pit of perdition into which
Europe has plunged is SAvitzerland.
It is about the only place in which
men seem to remember that the hu­
man family has any ties.
We Americans pride ourselves be­
cause we have sent something to Bel­
gium. Switzerland makes all we have
done look like a franc and a half.
It is the good Samaritan of the
world. It takes in the human dere­
licts wrecked by their breathren in
other countries and puts them togeth-1
er again. It has today 30,000 of the
sick and maimed soldiers of other
lands, nursing them back into human
shape!

hotels? They have been turned into

THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR, NO. 829 (NEWS OF THE WORLD) BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA, FRIDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 22, 1916
Farm, Tractors Turned Into Death Engines
To Mow Down Armies of Europe
Plain Implements of Peace Made
in U. S. for British Are Built
Into Land Juggernauts That
Crash Over Trenches and Spit
Bullets Into Ranks of Enemy.
Washington, D. C., Sept. 21.—A new
terror of war the land juggernaut,
lias been introduced on the battlefield
of Europe, spreading destruction
where neither rifle, gun or cannon
was effective, and army men here
predict this new engine of death will
play as important a part in the world
conflict as have the submarine and
the aeroplane.
This land juggernaut clamberr.
across hencifes aiid shell holes, spit­
ting bullets into the lineii of the en­
emy, smashes its way through for­
ests, crosses swamps with ease and
crawls along roads that have been
called impossible.
So far only the British have used
the "tanks," as they are being called
in the war zone, but army experts
predict that on account of their won­
derful effectiveness they will soon be
in general 'use, mowing down the
armies of all European nations at
war.
Army men hail the coming of the
j'tanks" as they hailed first reports
of successful use of the aeroplane
for scouting duty and for directing
infantry advances and as they hailed life term containment at $1,000
first successful use of submarines.
An army of more than 1000 of these
steel armored caterpillar-wheeled en
gines have been sent against the Ger
man lines, mowing down men by the
hundreds and terrorizing well-trained
soilders into disorganized retreat.
Many a Somme battle has been won
for the allies by a charge of these
death chariots.
The new engines are made in the
United States—at Peoria, 111., Before
they reach Europe they are simple
farm tractors. At firsfi they were
used to pull munition carts, but the
British have rigged the up with
guns and sent them crashing right
into the lines of the enemy.
Plants in Peoria are busy day and
night turning out the machines
ordinary tractor engines the farmers
are using in this country.
Big, clumsy caterpillars they are,
crawling along the ground on two
wide, corrugated belts, one on each
side, running over the forward and
hind wheels.
Along the sides of the belts are
short rails which clutch the cogged
wheels and form the driving mech­
anism.
The rails, in short sections, are
laid down with the belt attachment,
gripping the ground firmly and push
ing the 18,000-pound engine along un­
der 120 horsepower.
The body of the tractor is support­
ed by trucks with five wheels which
run on the steel rails. About seven
feet of belt and rails is on the ground
at once.
The length and width of the belts
and rails allows the tractor to run
smoothly over swamps, straddle
trenches, roll over logs, or climb
across shell craters.
As ordinary farm tractors the en­
gines are shipped to Aldershot, Eng­
land, where they are covered with
heavy steel armor plate and armed
with cannon.
What the Germans see is a mon­
strous machine, with a triangular
front crawling upon them, crashing
through woods and other obstacles
with its pointed front, coming straight
on over trench and shell hole, over
mound and embarkment. As it ad­
vances it spits fire from its heavy
guns, while its peculiar shape makes
it possible for its steel armor to glance
off any shells that happen to hit. it.
Zeppelins are overshadowed by this
juggernaut, for it has mowed down
more men than the Zepps have killed
and has scattered enemy lines to the
four winds.

VICTIM MAY DIE
FROM INJURIES
Girl Found in Frightful Condi­
tion After Being Tied to
Tree 24 Hours.
Bemidji, Minn., Sept. 21.—Sheriff
Charles Gunderson of Itasca county,
with a party of more than one hun­
dred armed men, tonight is searching
the woods in the vicinity of Ramsley
school, Itasca county, for an unknown
man, who Wednesday afternoon as­
saulted and shot Olga Dahl, nineteen
year-old teacher of the district school,
after tying her to a tree near the
school building.
It is believed that the man hid in
the woods and attacked the girl when
she came from the building at the
close of the day's work. She was
found, tied to the tree, twenty-four
hours later by persons who began
a
search for her when she did not re­
turn to her rooming house. She was
suffering from two gun shot wounds
and other injuries when found. To­
night it is said she may die.
Owing to the nature of the coun­
try in which the sheriff and his par­
ty are searching for the man who
assaulted the girl, little progress has
been made.

REPORTS BEING SENT
TO JOINT COMMISSION
Washington, Sept. 21.—The most
detailed account yet received of the
fighting at Chihuahua City last Sat­
urday when Villa celebrated the "Mex­
ican Independence Day" by a success­
ful assault on the Carranza garrison,
reached the war department today
from Brig. Gen. Bell, commanding
the El Paso military district. It
stated that Villa personally led the
attacking forces that he was joined
by a thousand or more men of the
Carranza garrison, and retired, prom­
ising to return soon, and taking with
him a large quantity of captured armfs,
ammunition and artillery.
Genera^ Bell's dispatch does not
show the source of his information
and many officials believe his account
was founded on rumors reaching the
border, as were various stories which
have been transmitted by state de­
partment agents. They were inclined
to believe for that reason that, the
full truth of what transpired is not
yet known.
All reports received are being fur-
