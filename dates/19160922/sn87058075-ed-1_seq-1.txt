Printzess Coats have always been beau
tiful in style and fabric, but we believe
(and we think that you will be of the
same opinion when you see them) that
the makers of Printzess Coats have really
surpassed any previous effort in getting
style and beautiful lines into their Coats
tms fall.
A try-on of these Coats will convince
you that they have many little points of
individuality about them which you can
not find in other makes.
Printzess Coats range in price from
$15.00 to $50.00
