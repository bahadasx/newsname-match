ESTABLISHED 1846.
FAIR WEEK
Ideal Weather Has Prevailed All
Three Days?Premiums of
Exhibits in Agricultural,
and Other Departments.
The Fair opened well on Tuesday.
The weather was ideal, and the crowd
the best, said president Greevcr, of
any first day, for a long time. The
crowd was not as large, owing to the
fact that the school fair, which has
brought a good crowd of children
and teachers each year, from all over
the county, who were admitted free,
was abandoned this year. The paid
admissions were up to me standard,
and over.
The superintendents of the depart?
ments were bus" all day placing and
entering exhibits, all of which are up
to the usual high standard, except
the corn exhibit, which, while credi?
table, is short owing to the early date
at which the fair is held.
There were a number of entries of
Boon County and Casey pure bred
corn, and several entries of common
corn, all of it good.
The display of apples is very fine,
though like corn, the winter apples
are not as matured as thev would have
been a few weeks later.

SHOT TO DEATH
Slayer Acquitcd by Justice of
Peace?Act Meets Approvul
of Entire Community.
Thomas Hall shot W. E. Idle at
Boissavaine, Wednesday night, Idle
died shortly afterwards.
Hall was arrested and tried before .
Geo. W. Gillespie, and acquitted. Hall
found Idle in a compromising position '
with his, Hall's wife whom he had
suspected for sometime. On Wednes?
day night Hall returned to his house
unexpectedly, and found Idlo with
his wife. Idle attempted to escape.
Hall followed and overtook him, a
tussel ensued in which Hall shot, with
deadly aim and effect as stated.
Hall is night foreman at Boissevaine
Colliery. Idle, tho duad man, is said
to have been a "Holy Roller" preach?
er. He has been at Boissevaine sever?
al months, and when he worked at
all, he is said to have worked at the
tinning and painting trade.
Magistrate Gillesnie's action, in
freeing Hall, is said to meet the ap?
proval of the community.
THE MIDWAY SHOWS.
The midway exhibitions are located
affectively this year, being near the
tunnel entrance, and on the side near
the track, on each side of a wide
street, leaving the rest of the grounds
open and unoccupied by shows of any
kind. There are quite a number of
shows, wheels, restaurants, etc., some
of them of doubtful propriety. How?
ever, in tho absence of any free at?
traction, a merry-go-round, these
shows were well patronized.
In the afternoon there wore two
races?a trotting race and a half
mile dash running race, which af?
forded the only real attraction for
the crowd during the day.
A CARD OF THANKS.
Through the agency of this paper I
wish to extend my henrty thanks to
the cood women of Tazewell and of
North Tazewell for all the kindness
and love shown me, and especially for
the recent token so graciously given.
I havu enjoyed my association with
you beyond expression in words, but
take this as my only means of appre?
ciation. I leave you in a few days,
and as I go, I take with me the sweet
consolation of knowing I have made
friends of you and a friendship that
will last. I ask God's richest bless?
ings upon you each and assure you
never shall I forget your loving kind?

II. Powell Chapman, editor of the
Ronuoko Times writes the following
account of Tririkle's reception at
Norton:
This town is fairly bubbling over
with Democratic enthusiasm this mor?
ning as the result of B. I.ee Trinklo's
splendid. Stirring address, delivered in
tl?e town hall last night before a
crowd that tilled every available nook
of space inside the building, the most
commodious in town, tilling up the
spacious isles. The seating capacity of
the ball is 750, 1 am told, and there
must have been at least three hund?
red more standing around the doors
and in lb.- aisles and an equal num?
ber on the outside of the building,
listening through the windows. Those
on the outside put planks up to tin
windows and crawled up them, that
they might the better catch the words
of the speaker. There were a number
of Republicans present. 1 nsked one
of them after Iho meeting what he
'bought of it? "Trinkle is all right,"
he replied emphatically. Of course
he is. The Democrats have known
it all along und the Republicans are
beginning to lind it out.
Rest Speech Yet.
Trinklo's speech last night was the
best 1 have nourd him make since 1
have been following him around?and
I have heard him make some good
mies, too. It was an enthusiastic and
llroy address and yet it was distinctly
conservative and moderate in its tenor
It was a gentleman's speech. Merci?
lessly did the speaker lay bare Bns
rom Slemp's absurd pretensions to
power and importance m the national
councils at Washington, and clearly
und convincingly did he show that
whatever of good things may have
come to the Ninth district during ?
hose good Democrat ic times were ?lue
lo those stalwart Virginians, Tom
Martin and Claude SwuilSOII, and
were gained in spite of and not be?
cause of Bascom Slemo. Clearly did
I'rinkle depict Slemp's constantly
growing sense of bis own importance
md omnipotence. "Why. he didn't
jven think enough of the Republican
convention that renominnted him for
congress to get on a sleeper at Wash?
ington at !> o'clock al. night, wake up
it Bristol in the morning and go be?
fore the convention to thank it for
he honor. Instead, he sent "Pen""
Srockctt to run things while he sat
it his desk in Washington, tore oil*
i telegraph blank and wired the con?
tention thnt he expected to he nomi?
nated. Think of it! Sittinc in Wash?
ington and wiring his orders to the
electorate of the Ninth district, -and
Ihey went ahead with rings In their
loses and did as he bade them do."
Defends Wilson's Record.
George Peery, a Tazewell product,
,vho has gone back home, after spend?
ing ten years of his life in this county,
preceded Trinkle and made u telling
speech, devoted principlly to u dis?
cussion of national issues. He de?
fense of Wilson's record? a record
.hat really needs no defense?was
itrong, conclusive, unanswerable, and
le gave evidence that the new candi
late for elector at large on the ticket
.1' the Virginia Democracy is an orator
in ndditon to his other many fine at?
tributes. George is very popular
lown in this end of the district, and
lis addition to the ticket is hound to
itrengthen Trinkle
By the way, "Bill" Bades, who is
toted for his dry wit and humor for
piles around got off a good one on
Peery yesterday evening. Observing
Jeorge's tall form approaching, Bados
?emurked to the group seated in front
if the St. Charles Hotel: "Boys, here
:omC8 our elector-nt-long." Those
?vho don't get this should write me
Tor an explanation enclosing a
tramped, addressed envelop for reply.
Write only on one side of tho nuptjr
md sign your name legibly.
Over in Big Stone, Gap yesterday a
fanny thinu huppened in the barber
?.hop?candidates huve to go there the
mme as other folks: that is, all of them
jxeept Chas. E. Hughes, who will
Vnit until November 7 to get trimmed
i'rinklc's slim fingers was stretched
nit in front of tlie tonsorial artist,
,vho was doing his best with the dark
:y's delight, namely, a razor, to render
;he candidates features unrcconiz- ?
ible. A youth came in and entered
nto conversation of destruction, the
ji\k veering 'round to politics, ns con?
versations sometimes do out here.
Slemp's Cousin Sneaks Out.
"This man Trinkle is making it hot
"or Bascom," averted the youth.
"You oughtn't to say that," replied
Lhe barber. "Bascom Slemp's your
?ousin isn't he?"
"Yes" said the young fellow, "but
[ m getting nil-fired tired of hearing
them talk about 'Bascom, Bascom,
llascom.' It's high time somebody
jlse wns having it, and this man Trin?
kle will do as well as unybodv eslo."
There was a general laugh, in which
Mr. Trinkle joined after which he
walked uj) to the dumbfounded youth
and held out his hand, remarking
nlcnsuntly: "Good morning; I'm that
man Trinkle you have been talking
itbout. I agree with you that Cousin I
Bascom has had it long enough and I
lielieve that the people of this district,
like you, are tired of hearing about
'Bascom, Bascom, Baacom,"*
By the way, they have a mighty
handsome postofticu over in Big Stone
Gap. The folks over there estimate
that it has cost the Ninth district ov?
er $90.000 in salaries paid to the two
Slemps. Bascom also claims the cred?
it for the hnndsomc building now go?
ing up here in Norton, n beaut" it is
too. However, I have a strong sus?
picion that if chairmnn Swnnson, of
the committee on public buildings,
and Chairman Martin, of the com?
mittee on appropriations, hadn't want?
ed it to go through, Bascom's little
bill would be reposing in some for?
gotten pigeon-hole over in the senate
building today and that ground would?
n't have been broken for tho splendid
edifice now fnst nearing completion.
Wise county hns fallen for Trin?
kle and fallen good and hard. Bascom
Slemp is going to have uphill sled
ing when he starts to put his gum.i
boots on nnd starts around the dis?
trict, unless I'm pretty badly fooled.
