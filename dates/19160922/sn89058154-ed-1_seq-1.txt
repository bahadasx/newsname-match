Oklahoma Letter ,
Guthrie, Okla., Sept. 15, '16.
Today as I look out, my eyes rest
on a scene quite different from a few
weeks ago; then it was a glowing,
glimmering heat from the sun's golden
rays, which, spread its scorching
touch over tree,' grasi and flower,
giving a brown, wilted appearance to
the former,' and robbing the latter of
all brightness and perfume. Only the
field flowers, so strong in their purple,
yellow, and white beauty stood the
test of the blazing heat, it was an
admirable sight to find them glowing
with almost seeming defiance, as they
turned their "faces to the gleaming
sky, which, when we made the effort
to lift our eyes upward, we were
greeted by a most ejjendid canopy W
the clearest,' deepest blue, mingled
with soft snowy clouds of wavy whife,
smiling down-' on the earth, where
man, animal, and plant were, crouch
ing,, seeking rest and comfort in
some shady spot. ' .' ..'
v Now, on the grass, which is begin
ning to assume its natural color, the
trees cast a deeper shadow in the
sunshine, which has a softer touch,
the sky a tenderer blue, and the
breeze brings with it a cooler atmos
phere, all telling of the 'mild Septera
ber days, which are creeping softly
on the trail of the departing summer,
with her dazzling, glowing days, her
lovely mornings ushered in by the
songs of the birds, who rejoice in the
sweet, refreshing coolness of the
dawn, which penetrates the heart of
man, and brings animation to Nature.
Her lovely moonlight nights, which
hold one spellbound, so fascinating,
so bewitching, as to make one re
luctant to close their eyes in sleep,
and miss the wierd, but beautiful
scenes of shadow, and Boft silvery
light, radiating from the throne of
the empress, who rules the skies by
night. '; Tl
I never knew people more interest
ed in education than they are out
here, and there are a vast number of
teachers, but I suppose It is because

fine buildings, which I saw a shoit
time ago, and there are about twenty
five hundred - average attendance.
There were three thousand teachers
attended the summer school this year
I hear that there is no sacrifice that
they will not make to get through
school and earn a certificate, some
even going so far as to live on a
rather limited amount of food, and
of course' the body ' fails to gain in
strength while the mind is being
trained, a plan which I do not approve.

MORE MEN THAN WOMEN
HAVE APPENDICITIS
Surgeons state men are slightly
more subject to appendicitis than
women. Selmer people should know
that a few doses of simple buckthorne
bark, glycerine, etc., as mixed in
Adler-i-ka, often relieve or prevent ap
pendicitis. This mixture 'removes
such surprising foul matter that ONE
SPOONFUL relieves, 'almost ANY
CASE constipation, sour stomach of
