sion. Afterwards. Karl Helfrerich.

The Bundesrath yesterday extended
by one year the term of the Reich
stag which should have concluded Its
session in January, 1917. The legisla
tive period of the Alsace-Loralne Diet
as similarly extended.
John Skudlarck claims that he 'was
"assaulted, beaten, bruised and all
treated In pursuance of a conspiracy
and confederation acting in behalf, of
the Monumental Brome- Co., and tho
men above mentioned and that the de
fendants directed and caused tlx
beating. The same is alleged by John
Zalaski, who further charges that he
was haled to court after the beating
at the instigation of the defendants,
with "malicious design to - Injure."
John Hriczu alleges he was also haled ;
to court for the same reason. - j
Organizer Daffy, who Is a defendant
Hn the- $200,000 suit brought by the I
foundrymen several weeks ago, and I
who conducted tlje strike In the foun-!
dries, said this afternoon: . ' j
"These men were riding bicycles on i
a lonely road when the employes of I
the plant drove up in an automobile, j
allowed thugs to beat up the riders,
and then drove away. Subsequently j
they caused the arrest of the men j
they beat up, charging them with i
having thrown stones.
Even though the charges were nolled.
dragging innocent men into, court
isn't going to help them to be good
citizens or teach them respect for the
law. Confident because of the right
eousness of their cause, the men are
now fighting the foundrymen witli
their own weapons the courts." .
Mr. Duffy said he has no fear of the
outcome. He said the union had
beejk- obtaining strong evidence forf
several weeks and is now prepared to
teach the foundrymen a lesson.
, It is contended in the action that"
the alleged assailants of the strikers
have been shielded by the defend-J
ants and their names refused.
The suits are expected to create
a country-wide interest because the
strength of the union, and tine vital
principles involved insure a fight.
- "We shall make them account Inj ,
court for the wrong they have donej
to labor," said Mr. Duffy.
Attorney Keating said this after-1
noon that the foundrymen never ln-
tended that their suits should be tried j
In court, and that they had brought j
them to give the strikers "a black,'
eye." ' ' '
