with an increase of from 10 to 15 cents
a month thereafter to cover the storage

Co-operation of
Everyone
Is Desired In The Coming Tu
bercular Campaign.
In the tuberculosis survey of the state
board of health that will be held in this
county early in October special efforts
will be made to secure the co-operation
of the churches, of the employers of
labor and of various local organizations.
During the week before the free clinics
are held state board of health nurses
will come here to make all the neces
sary preliminary arrangements.
The pastors in the various towns in
the county will be asked -by the health
workers to place the subject before
their congregations, to call attention to
the dates and places where the clinics
will be held, and to impress upon their
congregations the advisability of taking
advantage of this opportunity for a fre
examination.
Employers of labor throughout the
county will be requested to let those of
their employees who need a physical
examination go to the free clinics. The
state board of health is trying, in all
these county health campaigns, to get
into close touch with all persons whose
work is indoors and who consequently
are more likely to be physically run
down than others.
The state health nurses moreover
will get into touch with all the physi
cians they can reach and with all other
persons of influence in the various
communities in an effort to secure their
aid. The main purpose is to get as
many physically run down persons in
each community as possible to submit
to an examination, and everybody can
aid in this by urging friends and
acquaintances to take the test.
There are two distinct classes of col
ledge graduates: Those who accept
positions and those who hunt jobs.

Memory Day
Governor Ferris Urges All To
Look at Heirlooms and Retail
N Departed Friends.
Gov. Ferris has issued the following
proclamation designating Sat. Sept. 30,
as 4,Memory Day." 4,For the young
there are no real memory days. The
young have little concern about the
past. They are content with the pre
sent or they are impatiently peering in
to the future. The aged care little for
the future and naturally look to the
great past. On Sept. 30, let us refresh
oar memories by again looking at the
old daguerreotypes, photographs and
keepsakes of those gone before. Let
us again tell the tales of our school and
childhood days, tell of the struggle and
victories of our fathers and mothers
and comrades, tell the story of our
country's birth and growth and tri
umph. It is our wish that ere long the
thirtieth day of September may become
Memory day throughout the nation.
''Therefore, I, Woodbridge N. Ferris,
Governor of Michigan, do hereby issue
this proclamation and enthusiastically
urge the observance of Saturday, Sept.
30th, 191 G, as Memory Day."

UTIb J. SMITH,
City Clerk.
WHO KNOWS?
The good concrete roads that this
man, Van Pelt is so strongly advocating
may not be needed in a few years. Re
member, the flying machine is in the
air.
We were talking with Van about this
the other day and called his attention
to it. 4 4 Well", he said, "that Is right.
Stranger things than that have happen
ed. Nobody expected that a submarine
would ever be built that could cross the
ocean, but it has been done and even
at the great cost incurred, it paid for
itself the first trip. So it may be with
the flying machine. But we have the
autos on hand now and it is our duty to
build roads that will stand up under
the great strain put upon them until
the flying machine is made perfect and
cheap. Probably, "Henry" will get up
a flying machine and he may be work
ing on them now for all we know. A
Ford flyer with a Ford -auto would
make a great combination. If the auto
should give out, the flyer could pick it
up and take it and its contents to its
destination and if the flyer should give
out, the little tin Elizabeth could pick it
up, put it on the running board and
there you are.
"In the meantime, you know, and so
do I, that there is no road except brick
or concrete that we can use to advant
age at the present time. The concrete
roads are now all built in our minds.
Now, lets move up another peg and
build them in reality, for it it the ideal
road and the interest on the cost of this
road will not begin to be as large as the
upkeep of a macadam road."
"Another thing in its favor is the fact
that we will have the use of it now and
it will be good for fifty years, if it is
properly built, and with but little
expense for its upkeep that is, if the
street opposite the Elston Hotel (now
Michigan) at the south end of Bridge
Street in Charlevoix is any criterion.
This piece of road has been down seven
years without one cent of expense for
upkeep and is as good today as it was
when laid and the travel that it has
alread been subjected to has been
greater than the entire" traffic from
Charlevoix to East Jordan since the
County was first settled."
"Now, which is the cheapest road for
us to build the nine foot macadam
road that we are now building, or the
nine foot concrete road with shoulders
of crushed hardheads, four feet wide
on either side, making a road seventeen
feet in width?"
Primary Law
Fails to Satisfy
Under it the People do not Rule
in Making Nominations.
Barry Co. Proves Law Docs Not Work Well.
Too Eipeniive and Ineffective. The
Banaer Suggests Some Remedies.
(Hastings Banner.)
Judged by its workings in Barry
county, we would say that the present
primary law creates unnecessary
expense, is cumbersome, ineffective,
and utterly fails as a means of ''letting
the people rule" in making party
nominations. We will not go outside
of Barry county to prove our claims.
We are not partisan in our criticisms,
for the present statute was passed by a
republican legislature'and signed by a
democratic governor. Responsibility
for the law must be shared by botjj
parties.
The Banner believes in ''letting the
people rule," and believes they will
generally make good choices where
they have the opportunity to know the
candidates. But in the case of state
and national officers, they cannot have
that opportunity; and even in county
matters, knowledge of candidates is
limited.
It will cost Barry county taxpayers
fully $1,000 to hold the primary on
August 29. We believe that, for a
small fraction of that sum, more satis
factory results could be obtained.
To show how completely the law fails
we will first instance the manner in
which the democrats of Barry county
named their candidates who appear on
their primary ballots. We are not say
ing what we do to criticise persons or
parties, but rather to point out defects
in the present primary law. Ordinarily
in November the democrats poll from
800 to 1500 fewer votes than the re
publicans in Barry county. Ordinarily,
therefore an acceptable candidate on
the republican county ticket is reason
ably sure of election; and a democratic
candidate for county office, sunless
there be some special weakness in his
republican opponent, is reasonably
certain of defeat. That very situation
insures plenty of candidates on the re
publican side, except where a candidate
is clearly entitled to a renomination.
By the same token, that situation
makes democratic candidates very
scarce in Barry county. Few care to
sacrifice themselves or put up a cam
paign for an office where chances of
success depend on the weakness of an
opponent, or some friction in tlie
majority party.
This situation therefore, forces the
democratic leaders in Barry county to
do something in order to preserve their
party organization and to save their
party the humiliation of having no
candidates at the primary. Somebody
must set in motion the machinery that
will grind out names for the democratic
primary ballot. When no one seeks
the office, it is up to the leaders, who
are interested in their party, to ascer
tain what democrats are, willing to
allow their names to run.
Now as a matter of fact, not because
they wanted to be arbitrary, but be
cause the primary law compels them to
do so or see their party organization
collapse, less than a half dozen demo
cratic leaders in Barry county nearly
all of them in this city, had to take it
upon themselves to see that a demo
cratic primary ticket was named. They
did so by telephoning or calling on lead
ing democrats in each' township or
ward, to learn if there were any demo
cratic aspirants for office. They found
none. It then became necessary to
draft enough members of their party
who would be willing for the sake of
the party, to let their names appear on
the democratic ballot. It took not a
little persuading to get them. But the
primary theory of "letting the people
rule'' did not obtain, and could not, in
the selection of democratic primary
nominees. The law practically forced
a few democratic leaders to draft
enough democratic to fill the places on
the primary ticket. The "people" had
nothing to do with it. It was a 11" ar
ranged by a" half dozen men. Then
they prepared petitions and circulated
them, to secure the necessary names
to get their candidates on the primary
ballot. These petitions are parts of the
public records of Barry county. They
will show that the same persons signed
all of the petitions that put all the
democratic names on the primary ballot;
and that all the 70 signers appearing on
those petitions live in this city, Nash
ville, Middleyille and Woodland. The
16 townships of this county are not
represented at all on the petitions.
But from the standpoint of "letting
the people rule," this is a hallow farce.
Nothing could be farther removed from
that ideal than that six leaders and 70
signers of petitions, residing in Hast
ings, Middleville, Nashville and Wood
land, should make the primary nomina
tions for the 2,000 democrats of Barry
county. How nearly that approaches
the ideal of letting the people make
their own nominations we leave our
readers to judge.
Turn now to the republican party,
whose 3200 voters put it decidedly in
the lead in this county. Represen
tative, sheriff and treasurer are run
ning for second terms; so no contests
for those places. There are four candi
dates for probate judge, three for
prosecutor and two for register. The
petitions, except for coroners, for re
publican candidates, bear different
names.
In the past about 1,000 republicans
have roted at Barry county primaries.
Because of greater interest this year,
probably 1,500 will do so. If contests
are nearly even, it would be possible
for 400 republicans to nominate the
candidate for probate judge, and 550 or
600 their candidate for prosecutor.
In other words, a minority of the
voters who actually vote, and but a
small fraction of the 3200 republican
voters of the county will do the nominat
ing for probate judge and prosecutor.
The widest and wildest stretch of the
imagination could not say that a law
under which such results as we have
indicated are certain or possible can be
other than ineffective, when the ideal
aimed at is: "Let the DeoDle rule."
The Banner suggests a possible
remedy. It would cost but a fraction
of the expense of the August primary.
Let the voters of all parties at the April
election, by secret ballot choose dele
gates to a county convention. Let all
candidates for county and state office
file nomination petitions as now. Let
the delegates at, such convention by
secret Australian ballot, choose all
candidates for county office, and all
delegates to state and district conven
tions. Let all names of candidates for
county office or delegates appear on
the one. ballot, and require a majority
of the convention to nominate. Let
state and district conventions choose
candidates for state officers, congres
sional and legislative candidates in the
same manner, by the secret Australian
ballot system. Back the law with a good
.corrupt practices act, and money would
be saved to the taxpayers and to the
candidates, and the people would have
a better chance to rule than they do
under the present primary law.

George and Henry Strevel, father
and son, residing twelve miles north
west from Bay City, have been arrested
on complaint of Assistant State Fire
Marshal, Sam Robinson on the charge
of setting fire to the former's dwelling
early the morning of Sept. 8th with in-,
tent to defraud the London and Liver
pool and Globe Fire Insurance Co.
Strevel carried $3,400 insurance which
was written Aug. 15, 1916. Sheriff
Fitzgerald and the fire marshal found
that the property had been fired in
nine different places and that a quanti
ty of kerosene had been used for the
purpose. Strevel admitted to the offi
cers that he had had eight former fires
several upon which he had collected
insurance.
The more praise a man bestows on
himself the wiser he is not.
It is easier to criticise the small mis
takes of others than it is not to make
a few large ones yourself.
