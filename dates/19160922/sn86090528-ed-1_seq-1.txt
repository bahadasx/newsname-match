London, Sept. 22. That the kaiser
will muko peace overtures about tho
middle of October is confidently be
lieved by British military and civil of
ficials. According to apparently well au
thenticated rumors that reached Lon
don, Germany, having suffered huge
losses in the recent allied offensive,
is trying to arrange for an armistice
through the United States or Spain.
It is understood that King Alfonso
has been unresponsive and Is not like
ly to take any action in this direction.
It is tho belief hero that the Germans
hope to tempt President Wilson t)
start negotiations when the attend
ant success would most likely have a
favorable effect upon his -re-electiion.
Americans who are conversant with
inside British sentiment are certain
that such a move would be foredoomed
to failure and would arouse so much
resentment among the allies as to per
manently eliminate the United States
as a possible mediator.

BUT NEGLECTED
Special Annual Appropriation of $275,000

Boon to Small Towns
To overlook no bet which will add

stitution in the county is the policy of
County Superintendent Shepard am,
he is now busy trying to land between
$10,000 and $15,000 for the Grady
schools this year. If successful he will
be able to afford means whereby many
short terms made imperative by insuf
ficient local appropriations will he

schools.
Asks for Eight Months.
In tho reports which aro now under
preparation for submission to the in
toiior department, Superintendent
Shepard will ask for eight months
terms for all schools in the countv
whose appropriations were cut short
by the county commissioner's inabili
ty to allow greater than a five-mill
levy and where sufficient increases in
excess of that sum were not, voted by
the school districts. Under a federal
law tho sum of $275,000 is appropriat
ed by the United States yearly for
public schools in the Cherokee, Creek,
Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole anJ
Osage nations and tho Quapaw agen
cy. It oider to avail tiiu'.aselvcs of the
benefits of this appropriation" county
superintendents must make out esti
mates in advance every year and dur
ing the school term must render
monthly and quarterly reports to the
department of the interior on attend
ance and other details of schools
which are the beneficiaries of this
fund. Last year Grady county receiv
ed approximately one-fortieth, of the
entire fund and will probably exceed
that this year. Every teacher must
also" report every Indian child receiv
ing instruction for which the govern
ment allows ten cents per day.
BIG THINGS
ON TAP FOR
DIVERSION
0. C. W. Will Bring High Classed Enter
taincrs in Lyceum Course During
Winter Months
The .eitWnship of Chickasha wilt
not suffer this winter for want of in
tellectual or cultural manna and Pres
ident Austin of the Oklahoma College
for Women will be largely responsi
ble for these great treats. .
The greatest attraction during the
winter months will be the. Lyceuni
Course, given under the auspices of
the Young Women's Christian associa
tion at the Oklahoma College for Wo
men.
The season will open with The Zede-
ler Symphonic Sextette whose sympho
nic efforts aro especially unique, due
to a specially built reed organ. The
much sought-after Hawaiian Quintet
will be here quite a victory for Chick
asha, as their popularity has spread
all over the United States, so that it
is almost impossible to get. them for
an engagement. Among the other at
tractions are Dr. Southwkk; Pi".
Thomas E. Green of the American
Peace Society, whose lectures hava
been described as orations such as
one hears but once in a life-time. The
Buells Entertainers in musical and
dramatic -.ketches will be followed by
that lecturer of cheer John Kendrick
Bangs.
Tho price of the season ticket foi

crs and students of both O. C. W. and
the public schools and the season tick

BUSINESS AT VERDEN
WILL BE REDUCED
Recent Robberies of Express Offices Where
Whiskey and Beer Were Only Booty
is C: u ;e of Action
Recent robberies of the Ame'nn
express offices at Verden, Cement, El
gin and Fletcher w here only consign
ments of whiskey and beer were stol
en have led the express company to
revive a ruling which was put into el'
feet after similar robberies last De
cember but which was disregarded
during the spring and from that time
until now.
It is suspected that the larger part
of tho consignments of liquor to the
Verden office comes to Chickasha and
by cutting out tho shipments to this
point a large percentage of that busi
ness will Lie lost. Under present con
ditions, which inspire frequent rob
beries, the traffic in Intoxicants is not
profitable to the express company and
henceforth all consignees, in order
to receive shipments, must make afli
davit that they aro not residents of
eastern Oklahoma or tho old Indian
Territory and that the beer or whis
key is for their own personal us-.
This, it is believed, will have the ef
feet of reducing tho traffic, materially.
In the event of the refusal of tlA con
signee to make, such affidavit the
agent, is instructed to return the. ship
nients to the shipper at the latter'.

tho shipper to send out packages vo
