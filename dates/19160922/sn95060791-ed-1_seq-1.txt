Governor Hunt's Statement
Under date of Phoenix, Sept
13. Governor Hunt issued the
following statement:
To the People of Arizona:
As the incoming returns indi
cate, quite conclusively, that my
renomination for the Governor
ship is certain. I hasten to ex
press to the Arizona public my
profound appreciation of the
support so freely given to my
candidacy. While I would not
be human if I did not experience
on this occasion the utmost satis
faction at my nomination, I real
ize quite fully that the greatest
victory consists in the electorate'
vindication of representative
government, as embraced by the
state's Constitution and the
record of constructive public
efforts -which is based upon its
fundamental principles. Surely
it has been demonstrated, beyond
a doubt, that the people of Ari
zona will not readily submit to
yoke of organized greed. While
the campaign before the pri
maries was marked by bitter at
tacks upon those rights andprin
ciples which Arizona's people
hold most dear, 1 personally har
bor no resentment against those
Democratic voters who, for
reasons which they doubtless
deemed worthy, opposed me in
my race for renomination. It is
my earnest hope that all such
Democrats will accept the re
sult of the Primary election in a
spirit of generosity and fair play,
turning their efforts henceforth
to the winning of a great victory
for Arizona's liberal Democracy
in November.
Gratefully and sincerely,
Geo. W. P. Hunt
Sisters of St. Francis Coming
Two Sisters of St. Francis will
be in Holbrook next week for the
purpose of soliciting funds for
ihi? prAiHan of a modern and np-
to-date hospital in Gallup, N. M
Today there is not a good hospi
tal between Albuquerque and
Los Angeles, hence a good and
complete modern hospital in Gal
lup will, no doubt, prove a bless
ing not only for this immediate
vicinity, but for the entire coun
try within a radious of several
hundred miles.
It is expected that the outside
places tributary to this
section will show themselves
generous in lending financial as
sistance towards building an in
stitution that will be a boon to
numberless suffering men and
women.
Needless to say this proposed
hospital will be open to Catholic
and non-Catholic alike.
Rev. E. Kunkel, Gallup, N. M.
Holbrook Loses Good Citizens
Last Monday morning J. Frank
Mattbevs and Jesse S. Hulet left
Holbrook with their families and
household goods for Navajo,
where they will make their fu
ture home. Messrs. Hulet and
Matthews have fWrcjHwpd the
general merchandise ' stybre of
Burr W, Porter, who has teen
located in Navajo for a number
of years, and who has amassed
a fortune in business. They will
enlarge the stock and will en
deavor to increase the business.
Holbrook suffers a distinct loss
in the departure of these people.
They have hosts of friends and
the best wishes of these go with
them to their new home.

as compared with lowest esti
