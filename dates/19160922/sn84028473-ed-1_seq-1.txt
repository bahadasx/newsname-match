NATIONAL STATE AND COUNTY
National state and county officials
aro to bo elected in November So
far as Ohio is concorned considera
tion nf lnnni nfflfcB is eliminated
There Is enough however to engago
a voters careful attention mis i
one of tho big years In politics
It will tend to the best results If
voteis generally will consider each of
the threo groups national state nnd
county upon its own merits without
trying to make loyalty fortho candi
dates on one group cover the sins or
tho weaknesses of tho candidates In
another group Tho old appeal of
party managers to voto straight has
lost its power A straight voter is
a blind voter who is willing to sub
stitute tho intelligence of some ono
else for his own
President vice president and mem
bers of congress will V course bo
elected upon national issues If
ilrmt wilunn tins mnrtn irond ho is en
titled to re election and the country Is
entitled to another four years of hl3
services Other things being equal a
Wilson supporter will give his voto
to the candidate for senate and house
who best represents the Wilson
icles and will support tho president In
congress
But the election of state officials up
on national Issues would be short
sighted and fraught with danger li
Ohio the particular gubernatorial is
sue Is that Involving the relative mor
i of tho Cox administration and tho
Willis admlnlstrtalon No one should
yote for a candidate for governor In
order either to stand by the pro ident
or to rebuke the president Th pres
idency Is not Involved In the stale
c on tpst fi
In the county contests there Is no
occasion for drawing a party line In
every case the task is to pick the best
man available for the particular of
fice regardless of party affiliation
The old day when one was moved to
vote for some certain candidate for
county coroner In order tp stand 1y
the president has happily departed
The obvious way to stand by the
president this year Is to re elect him
The most enthusiastic Wilson man in
Qhjo need have no pompunctlon about
splitting his vote as he pleases among
AcinHMaliii fav cifnta and rnnntv nffirMS
