Every man knows
that Insurance 4s a Valuable thing almost a
necessity, In fact. Everyone who. does not now
have Life Insurance protection realizes that he
should have at least ono policy, and many others
are Wishing that they could afford to carry moro.

nimi poiiiium on tho policy.
If you are an "Average Man" whether you
havo some insurance now or would like to have

neeU of It you will bo glad to hear that a plan
is offered for solving this troublesome financial
problem.

to tell the story of the
THRIFT" INSURANCE PAlfNG PLANS
Lot us suppose that you should take a $5,000.00
policy calling for a yearly .premium of about
ti9r: no vm if vmi nrmifl divide this annual ex
pense by GO, and pay for it at the fata ot $2.50
each jweck, it wouldn't look like such .a big
amount. 1
But, no responsible Old Line Insurance Com-
pany could afford to lot you pay your premium
by weekly installments, without advancing the
rates they ask, in order to cover tho cost of fre
quent collections. t ,
That is why thiB bank is offering you the
"Thrift" Insurance Paying Plans to enable you
to make wookly deposits and accumulate-a fund
for your premiums. Wo will phy interest on each
weekly deposit which will save you some money,
besides
THERE IS-A "THRIFT?' PLAN
to provide for any insurance premium
largo or small whether it is an old one
due in a few months, or ono you have
just contracted for.x
