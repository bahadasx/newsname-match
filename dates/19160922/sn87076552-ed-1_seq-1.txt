THE REVENUE Bill
Remark of Hon. Nelson E. Matthews
in Regftrd to Revenue Bill In House
of Representative, July 10, 1916
The "Why" and "Wherefores." '
Mr. Speaker, availing myself of the
privilege of extending my remarks, I
desire to present my views on the
pending revenue measure prepared in
secret by the majority members of the
great Ways and Means Committee of
the House without consulting any one
of the minority members on that com
mittee, and, for that matter, no 'one
on the minority side knew anything
about the bill until it was introduced,
accompanied by a rule from the ma
jority members of the Committee ph
Rules which allowed two days of gen
eral debate, after which the bill must
of their products -except, as England
permits. It 1s admitted by-all that;
if the Payne-Aldrich' taTifT law had
been in force during the past three
years hundreds of millions of dollars
of additional revenue would have been
rnllortpH. the Public Treasury would
now be overflowing with money, and
we would not now have to resort to
all sorts of taxation to raise the reve.
nue necessary to carry on the Govern
ment, even with the extraordinary ex
pense incurred by reason of the in
creases of the Army and Navy, and
it would not be necessary to issue
bonds to pay for the expenses brought
nhmit-hv mir uncalled-for interference
in Mexican internal affairs as this bill
no v proposes to do.

By the " way, what are the Pres
ident's Mexican policies and, tor ina.
nue over and above the revenue raised . matter, what are his policies gene-ai
by laws now in force. And by a sys
tem of internal taxation, which is a
direct tax lexied on the people, and is
a well-timed, bold, and deliberate at
tempt on the part of President Wilson
as he absolutely controls the present
majority to sidetrack and, if possible,
destroy all hope of ever framing a
tariff based on the theory of protec
tion to our manufacturing and agri
cultural interests against cheap labor
in other parts of the world.
The bail offered Republicans to
abandon their time-honored principles
and come over nd help our Democra
tic friends out of the mire in which
they are floundering is ft "tariff com
mission," composed of six members,
11 to be appointed by the President,
who are to each receive salary of
$7,500 per year and all expenses; al
so ft secretary, with ft salary of $5,000
per year and all expenses; to
gether with host of clerks and
retainers. The bill appropriate
$300,000 for the first year's expenses
of the commission, and the expenses
of the second year will probably be
$500,000.
In passing let me say that for years
prior to 1912 the Democrats were
complaining and crying out against
the very large number of persons in
the employ of the Government, and
yet during the first three years of Mr.
Wilson's administration over 30,000
employees have been added to the pay
roll, causing an increase of expense
for salaries from that source alone of
$36,000,000 or over per annum. And
this increase has been,! caused by the
numeruus new commissions nu 01
new specifications be prepared. Fol-
! lowing the recommendation of this

instruct the clerk to notify all bid-

in chronicling the change of. owner

Mr. a K. Shoop to Mr. Albert Kolb
of Cleveland we stated that Mr. Thos.
Jones would continue in charge of the
barn. We mean't to say Mr. Thos.
Hill and it was a slip of the Editor's
pencil not the type that was respon
sible for the mistake..
Some of the 'patrons of the barn
were very regretful when they read
of the displacement of Mr. Hill, for Mr.
Hill with his genial and cheery man
ner and readiness to tblige everyone
has made warm friends of those who
patronize this convenient institution.
We appologize to the patrons for the
error and to Mr. Hill for misnaming
him.

false consciousness
and the universe?
Was it not this very false sense or
false consciousness that Christ Jesus
himself denounced and unmasked
when he declared to those who are re
veling his t'eachings: - "Why do ye not
understand -my speech, . even because
ye cannolr hear my words. Ye are of '
your father, the deviL He was a mur
derer from the beginning; and abode
not in the truth, because there 'is -no"
truth in him?
Paul designated this "murderer
from the beginning" as "the carnal
mind," which he immediately defines
as "enmity towards God." .
Mrs. Eddy characterizes this same
condition of thought, as mortal mind
and proceeds at once in Christian
Science, to show how it may be over
come and escaped f rom- not by ignor
ing its claims or fearing them but
through the recognition and demon- ,
stration of man and the universe
created . and., forever maintained in
perfect continuity by One -Creative
Mind of God. . .
Objections to Right Idea -

Indeed1 such a . one might be very
well likened to the little boy who
went with ' others of , his playmates
upon an outing into the country.
All during the day he wafc observed '
apprehensively upon the outer end of
the games, never entering joyouly in
to the sports of his fellows. And up
on being asked why he had not gather

that -his mother told him that morn- -ing.

and look out for snakes! And so
the little fellow had been looking for
snakes all day. .
It would be very possible to do so.
but I am sure you will agree that it
would be tremendously poor policy for -one
to go through life looking for -
snakes. One' would miss thereby the
kingdom of heaven!
True Idea: Necessary-Authorized
All of the teachings -of Christ Jesus
point clearly not only to the proprie
ty, but to tne imperative necessity for
gaining a true understanding of God,
and of truly understanding man's' un
ity witD..uoa;-
The words of the Master in this con
nection are .clear and conclusive, and
may. not misinterpreted in the least. -
"If ye continue in my. words j ye
shall know ' the truth, and. the -truth
shall make you free." ,
"This' is fife eternal, that they may
know thee." ' - '
And then" as though to forever sil
ence the human cavil that it might
be blashemy for man to be Godlike, :
for man to be as God created ma&.
"Be ye perfect, EVEN as your 'a
ther which is in heaven is perfect."
"I pray not for these alone That
they all may 'be one.... Even as thou.
and I art one." .
'JTake my' yoke upon you." "
No one has ever attained greater "
facility of ; expression through par
able' and metaphor than Jesus, and
the selection in this instance is parti
cularly appropriate as indicating His
perfect unity or oneness with the Fa
ther. The yoke is made "use of ;to di
vide a burden, or load between two, so
that two may work together, as one.
The illustration in this instance in
dicating man's unity 'or oneness .with
God, whereby mankind,, is healed, and
blessed and its burdens, lightened.
Having -no other mind, intelligence
or thought than- the One Creative
;Mind or God which he called the Fa
ther,, he was always thinking God s
thoughts. And. this was His yoke!

THE FARM CREDIT BILL
Congress has passed it and the President has signed
it. So far so good. But the underlying principle of
getting a loan under the regulations of this new bill, is
after all, a good reputation, ability and resources upon
which to obtain the loan.
The same old rule; the rule that has determined the
making of any loan from time immemorial.
Any farmer, any man, can build up for himself a ,
credit standing that will entitle him to the confidence
and the financial assistance of his fellow men. ;
As the bank is one of the principal institutions
through which men build up their credit rating we invite
you to become a regular customer of the
