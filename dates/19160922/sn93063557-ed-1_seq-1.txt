The Yale Night Latch is the lock
of security and convenience secure because noth
ing but its true Yale key will operate it from the
outside; convenient because it can be operated
from the inside by simply turning a knob.
The best known night latch is the "Yalee
No. 42." We will explain how it works.'

easily accessible, but not intentionally.

At the oponing of tho 117th yenr of
Middlebury Collogo nnd at this flrst
student assembly in this statoly nnd
benutiful chapel, whose dignity nnd
impressiveness must move us nll to
scrious and onmost thought, I wish to
sound n noto of progress in tho things
which mnko up tho inner life of n col
logo. What shall it profit us if we gain
mngnificent buildings nnd rich endow
ments, nnd bonst n wide domain of
primevnl forost, if wo loso thnt spirit
of high nmbition nnd ncadcmic earnest
ness which hns been all our glory in the
great days of the pust? Silas Wright
and Solomon Foote, Edward J. Phelps
and JohnG. Saxe, Henry Nonnan Hud
son nnd Albert Ilurd, nnd Stewnrt nnd
Kellogg and Brainerd and Mead nnd
Heplmrn camo not from marble halls
and from dormitories with rooms with
bath, but from great tenchers, Iike
Nathaniel Chipman nnd John Hough
and Solomon Stoddnrd nnd Chnrles B.
Adnms nnd George N. Bonrdmnn, nnd
from n resolute purpose on their own
pnrt to master Greek tragedy, nnd to
know Shakespeare, and to grip the
problems of Calculus.
Since th i centenninl of our college in
1900 tho institution has gone forward
in nll materinl wnys by leaps and
bounds. At that time there was only
the old stone row, dignified, well-pro-
portioned, wrapt in time's incomparable
beauty, but plain in all their appoint
ments and limited in their facilities
both for student life and acndemic pur.
suits. In that centennial year the old
college was flnnked by the Egbert Stnrr
Librnry, still the genvof nll our college
structures, nnd year after year hall and
residence and laboratory have been
added until few of us could tell off-hand
how many college buildings we have.
It depends upon where in our spacious
campusesyou stop and what kind of
buildings you include. Including resi-
dences we have now 22 college build
ings, and the newest of them exceeds
both in cost and capacity all three of
the old buildings which were the only
home the college ncquired for itself in
the flrst 100 yenrs of its history.
In 1900 Middlebury College hnd 123
students. This yenr with the summer
session our catalogue will show well over
500. Then our faculty numbered 10: now
we have32instructors. Then our endow
ments were $400,000. We have today
half again as much. Then we offered
10G term courses: now we nre giving
217 semester courses. Then the college
wns spending less than $25,000 nnnually
for its students: the last Treasurer s
report shows an expenditure of $91,500.
We have a right to pride in this
record and it is proper we should put
the facts forcibly before the public.
The people of yermont do not yet
realize the advance that has been made
by Middlebury College in the first six
teen years of its second century. They
do not yet appreciate the advantages
we offer: for example, thnt we have
one of the best series of chemical labo-
ratories to be found in America, with
more couises than nre given in many
institutions which bestow ambitious
degrees in chemical engineering; nor
that our Department of Pedagogy is in
some respects the best practical normal
school for high school teachers to be
found in New England. Surprise as
well as admiration is expressed by every
visitor to this Mend Memorial Chapel
and by every one who examines the
facilities and equipment of Hepburn
Hall and looks off on the mountains
from its windows. They had not im
agined that such structures had been
erected for any college in Vermont.
I trust we have not finished our ma-
terial expansion We sadly need nn m
firmary and an endowment to sustain
