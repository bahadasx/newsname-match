BIG FIRE AT, PURDY.
WEDNESDAY
NIGHT
The Livery Darn and Nearly All the
Business Block South of It is
: Burned. Loss, $30,000
The little town of Purely, nine miles
south of Monetrt suffered a disastrous
fire on Wednesday night.
Buildings Burned
C. L. Brown & Son's Grocery.
W. S. Carlin Dry Goods Store.
Allbright Drug Store.
' Burrows Livery Barn.
The fire started at midnight in the
top of the Burrows' livery barn. It is :
thought that a spark from a freight
train set fire to the hay in the barn, j
The owners had unloaded a car load of
ar infn tliA ham lnft. the dav before !
and this made a fire that was impos
sible to be controlled by the local fire
department, the city not having water
works.
The wind was in the north and the
blaze was earned to the main business
ock south of the barn. Seeing that
the fire was spreading the Purdy citi
zens telephoned to Monett to ask'the
fire chief to go ,to their assistance
with the chemical apparatus, but as
-the tank this department has is so
small and only for use in incipient
fires Mr. Pitts was instructed that he
could do no good to go.
C.li. Brown & Son's grocery store
was burned, both building and con
tents except a few fixtures which they
were able to save.
The Carlin Dry Goods store was
burned. Mr. Carlin had just sold the
store to a Mr. Cumm'?Mrjew,
who had taken possession.
The Allbright Drug Store was also
a total loss and like Mr. Carlin, Mr.
Allbright had just sold his business
to Dr. Bailey, of Cassville.
The fire stopped at Monroe Fly's
building which is a brick but the side
nejft the fire was damaged seriously.
The Burrows livery barn was a com
plete' loss. .
It is estimated that the loss is $30,
'000. All of the owners carried insur
ance to partly cover their loss.
A Mrs. J. . E. Jenkins vieited .her
father at Motmt Vernon Tuesday. On
Wednesday she went to Aurora and
Visited Mrs. W. E. Marlon and at
tended the district Rebekah-meeting.

Prior to the conference the Ameri

Mexican commissioners a mass of doc

the information in possession of the
Americans was somewhat in the na
ture of a rebuttal to information that
had been offered by the Mexicans. The
report placed before the cbmmission
by the Mexican representatives have
been of a character calculated to depict
a rapidly recovering Country and to
offset stories that credited the govern
ment authorities in various localities
with lack of control and efficiency.
The American representatives have
not questioned the report submitted
by the Mexicans but much of the data
they exhibited 'today was contrary to
that offered by the Mexicans.

GALEA WAY
AND STILL THEY COME
That Wilson's clear-headedness,
courage and progressive tendencies
would attract the independent minds
of the country to his standard has
been confidently expected. Now as the
issues between the two presidential
candidates, the men tind the things !
they stand for, are being discussed j
and made clear the lining up begins.
Besides the large number of progres-
sive and independent leaders already i
in the Wilson ranks, in, the last two1
weeks the following significant things
have come to pass:
Thomas Edison comes out in aj
strong interview approving Wilson's j
courage, wisdom and course of action j
and announces his support of him. '
Roger Babson, Boston's famous sta- ;
tistician and financial expert, a life-'
long Republican, comes over to Wilson j
He is won to Wilson by Wilson's high j
conceptions and course in dealing with i
irrpflt. nntinnnl anA intpvnnfinTisil nrnh- !
- - - - -. . r .
Iems .
Luther Burbank, the world's most
distinguished scientist in plant life and
development, publicly announces ad
herence to Wilson, as "The greatest
President America has ever had."
Mils Ida M. Tarbell, one of the
foremost leaders of thought in Amer
ica, whose history of the Standard Oil
Company was nothing less than epoch
al in its effect, announces her active
support of Wilson. She said: "He is
the first real progressive leader this '
decade has produced."
. Miss Ella Flagg Young, Superinten
dent of Chicago's schools for years,
announces her support of Wilson and
is actively at work for his re-election.
Mrs. Antoinette Funk of Illinois,
one of the most distinguished suffra-
gettes in the nation, and a leading-.
Progressive, announces that she rwill
support Wilson, "Because I am a Pro- j
gressive," and because Wilson's record j
on the suffrage question is better than
Hughes'.
The Springfield (Mass.) Republi-
can, by many believed to be the most
influential paper in the United States,
a" paper that during its existence of
nearly a century has held an unwav
ering course of conscientious devotion
to the right as it saw the right, arrays
itself in the Wilson ranks.
The rejection by the National Amer-
ican Woman Suffrage Convention at
Atlantic City of Mrs. Raymond Rob
in's resolution in favor of .Hughes, Dr.
Anna Howard Shaw, ( the" venerable
pioneer leader, helping in its defeat.
j Over two thousand of the "vorking
i women of Chicago have formed the
i "Wilson Working Women's League,"
to work for the re-election of Wilson,
because "He places human values
above property values, the common
people on a par with 'Big Business.' "
