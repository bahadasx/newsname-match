GOOD ENROLLMENT !N GRADES
More attention this vear to elementary
science including agricultural Bot
any in 10th Grade
The Paw Paw public schools are
now well organized and every indi
cation points to a most successful
school year. Superintendent Hunger
ford, has worked hard to get the year
outlined and organized and is en
thusiastic over the prospect.-.
The school year starts out with an
enrollment of 407, classified as
follows: Kindergarten 18, First
Grade, 81 j Second, 40; Third, 32;
Fourth, 40; Fifth, 31; Sixth, 25;
Seventh, 25; Eighth, 34; High school,
120. The senior class numbers 20.
Of the high school enrollment, 60 are
foreign pupils.
There was an increase in tuition
this year of $5.00 in the eighth grade
and SI 0.00 in the high school. The
pupils however will get the benefit
of this slight raise in the way of new
equipment etc. The work Ki more
systematized this year, and better re
sults are sure to follow. For instance
more attention will be given to ele
mentary science. Heretofore one
half year has been devoted to elemen
tary science and one half to botany in
the ninth grade. Now one whole year
is given to science in the ninth grade
and one year to botany in the tenth
The work in botany will include
agricultural botany, and in the new
equipment ordered are three
new microscopes and a Babcock tester.
Harry Gottheimer has charge of the
science work, and this with the band
work, gives him plenty of time for
thorough work in this branch. The
manual training department in charge
of Harold Harboldt and the Domestic
science in charge of Miss Hilton are
also strong department! of the school
World The Paw Paw schools were
never better equipped for high class
practical work than now, and much
is anticipated of this years work.
ENJOY DINNER AT
THE SCOTT
E
Party of Paw Paw and
Bangor friends spend
Sunday at beautiful home
uf Leslie Seott in Arling
ton. Residents of Van Buren county
have heard much about the genial hos
pitality of Leslie Scott of Arlington
township. Not until one has been en
tertained in this beautiful home, by
Mr. Scott and his estimable family,
however, does he appreciate this
splendid gentleman, and his family.
Last Sunday a few of his friends re
sponded to invitations and were en
tertained at dinner in his home. A
bountiful and most delicious dinner
was prepared and served by Mrs.
Scot and her daughters in the spacious
and well appointed dining room.
After the last course was served and
cigars lighted, the son Leslie Jr.. who
was home from law school in Chicago
for the day, spoke very nicely of his
fathers friends and the pleasure it
had given them all to entertain some
of them. The guests then one after
another expressed their appreciation
to their hosts for such genuine hospi
tality and their high regard for Mr.
Scott. Those who were permitted to
enjoy this occasion were John Mutch
ler, ( has. Hick.-, II. A. Sherman, B.
F. Warner, M. H. Young, T. J. Cavan
augh, Dr. J. C. Maxwell, M. L. Deck
er and F. N. Wakeman of Paw Paw ;
M. ft Russell, John Sebring, James
I: in, Dr. J. R. Griffin of Bangor.
Several others who had been invited
were unable to be present and sent
their regrets. It was a glorious day
and one that will not soon be forgot
ten by each and every one of the
guests.

FAIR ADVERTIS-
IS
Blaze in Milwaukee Print-
ery curtails publicity for
the Van Buren County
Fair.
Advertising matter for the Van
Buren County Fair cannot be distrib
uted ai generoualy this year as it has
before owing to the fact that much
advertising, all printed and ready for
shipment, was destroyed in a fire
which recently wrecked a part of the
plant of the American Show Print Co.,
at Milwaukee.
A greater amount of advertising
was ordered this year with a view to
extending it over a greater territory,
but the fire at Milwaukee has dis
rupted the plans. Only a part of the
lithographed advertising was saved
V. th f!am0S' Tl this is nW beJ?g
distributed over the countrv.
The
printers advised that they would have
their plant in readines to reproduce
the work in time for its distribution,
but up to the present time the fair
official! have been unable to 'secure it.
Despite the shortage of advertising
materials, plant are going forward
Tor enlarging the fair in all of its
departments this year-a plan in which
the greater advertising campaign was
a factor. 9
The fair will be held at Hartford
Prom October 2nd, to 6th, and people
residing in sections where the adver
tising is not distributed as freely M
in former years may attribute that
fact to an adverse turn of the wheel
of fate, with the assurance that the
fair itself will not only be up to the
standard but greatly increased in
importance this year.-Hartford Day

DEATH CLAIMS FOR

Dwight Harrison died at his home
i in Kalamazoo last Wednesday morn
ing. He had been in failing health
for about six months, but was able
to attend to his work until about two
weeks ago, since which time he has
been confined to his bed. Bright's
disease was the immediate cause of
death.
He was married to Miss Bertha ! women's dry campaign organization

teen years. He was prominent in 1 Paw.
Masonic circles, and was Past Kmi-
nent Commander of Peninsular Com-
mander Knights Templar. For many
years he has been salesman for a
large wholesale drug company, and
was one of the best and most popular
men "on the road." He was esteemed
and respected by all with whom he
came in contact. He was but sixty-
nine years of age, and his sudden
death was a great shock to his rela-
tives and friends.

CeHfre only state to have inspec-
tion of Fruits. Much is expected
from the plan as outlined by
Mr. harrand
"Grapes that are mature,
sound, clean, of ripe color,
free Irom rot, mildew or mold,
true to name for variety in
dicated, medium to large
berries, bunches compact, well
formed ami not less than three

Such are th" specifications, and re
quirements for "rapes that will pass

to certificate and shipment in
Xerti-
fied Cars."
State inspection of fruit is a new
thing for Michigan. In fact there
is but one state in the Union, Cali
fornia, that has any kind of state in
spection of its fruit crop. Such in
spection is bound to come, and it !
seems fitting that Michigan, and
light here in our own Fruit Belt atlGremps street and are planning to
Paw Paw should lead the wav. It erect a fine new creamery. Work on
will be merely an experiment here
this year, but from this beginning will
result ultimately, State inspection of
all fruit and possibly other products.
County Agent Farrand, called a
meeting of growers at the council
rooms on Tuesday evening to explain
and discuss the proposition. About
seventy-five responded and it was a
most successful meeting. The move-
ment was started through the agent,
and Wolverine Association, Mr. Prater
being very enthusiastic about it from six routes from this village. Few
the start. All the associations want ; people have any conception of the
it, and on the interest taken in the I magnitude of this business. Just to
matter by the growers will depend j give an idea of what it means, it
its success. There is no reason whv'miirht be said that the pay roll for
v
Michigan Crapes should not bring as
much in the market as New York
I grapei, and they will if properly
Iselected and packed.
I One thing to be impressed upon
j the growers is, that this inspection
will not be obligatory. Any grower
; who has fruit which w ill come up to
jthe specifications and cares to take
jthe trouble to pack according to the
same, can have the grapes inspected
(by state inspectors. If they meet
all requirement! a certificate will be
issued, baskets immeHv certified, and
grapes shipped in certified cars. If
the fruit does not meet the require
mentS, r if the grower does not cart
for the Wispection, his grapes will be
hipped with others in a separate car.
The Associations here will be the
first to get this state inspection.
The success or failure of the move
ment is up to the grower. L. C.
Carey will be the state inspector for
Paw Paw and Mr. Carmody, for
Lawton. Both of these gentlemen
are from the M. A. C. and men of ex
perience in the inspection of fruits.

It was a strange and horrible fate

i..,t Inn l!nc?h ci I'AlinfT nrm in

East Porter last Tuesday afternoon.
It happened on the Mark Henion
place, and as near as the writer can
ascertain the facts are as follows :-
The young man went back in the
field about three o'clock in the after
noon to get a three year old colt,
which was to be taken to a neighbors
to be broken to drive. The colt WEI
wild, and Bush took a rope with
which to corral the animal and a
halter to lead him with. He did not
return from the field, and about eight
o'clock in the evening. Mr. Henion
discovered that the team which Bush
had left hitched in the yard when he
started for the field, was still there.
A search was instituted, and the un
fortunate young man was found in a
hollow of the field with one end of the
rope tightly wound about his neck,
and the other end about the colts
neck. He had evidently been dead
for several hours. His face, head and
body were horribly bruised, and a
trail left in the earth showed that he
had been dragged at least one hun
dred and sixty rods.
The supposition is that he threw
the rope with a slip noose in one end
over the colts head; that the loose end
wrapped about his own neck when
the horse jumped, drawing taut over
a large knot in the end. It is prob
able that the boys neck was broke n
w ith the first jump of the frightened
animal.
Deceased was twenty years of age
and single. He was the youngest
brother of Leonard Bush, the Stan
dard Oil man at Paw Paw.
HIT IN EYE WITH . '
STONE, CLOSE CALL
The Sophomores held a class party
at the Fisher home on Iioute four last
Friday evening. About thirty were
present to enjoy the event. Just be
fore the start for home, the boys and
girls were outside eating watermelon.
Some one who has not yet made his
identity known, threw a stone which
struck Frank Pierce in the corner of
the left eye. The force of the blow
knocked him down, and it was feared
for a time that the injury might be
serious. The stone did not strike the
eyeball however, and no serious re
sults are anticipated. The throwing
of rocks is a mighty dangerous thing
and in this instance it was a clos call
for Frank's eye.
MAJESTIC THEATER BURNS.
The Majestic Theatre in Kalamazoo
suffered a disastrous fire last Monday
evening. In some manner fire caught
under the stage about five-thirty in
the afternoon. It was just between
the matinee and evening performance,
and it is thought that it may have
been accidentally set by some of the
stage hands. The "Style Show" was
on there this week, and all the
costumes and scenery were destroyd.
The loss is heavy, and it will probably
be some time before the place can be
repaired ready to reopen.
DO n AGAIN.
When it comes to raising water-
melons, all the growers will have to
take oft" their hats to Scott D. Hall of
Almena township. The writer was
the recipient of one . of the finest
melons from his patch that he has
sampled in years. It was of the
"Sweetheart" variety, weighed twenty
three pounds, fine meated and sweet
as honey. Many thanks Scott, do it
again some time.
Friday October Kith, has been de
signated a " Angell Day," to be ob
served in all Michigan schools. Fred
L Keeler, Superintendent of Public
Instruction states in his official an
nouncement that "It is deemed fitting
that the schools pay tribute to the
memory of Dr. James B. Angell,
Michigan's Grand Old Man." Con
tinuing Mr. Keeler says, "Would it
not be equally fitting that Michigan
as a state join with the schols in
honoring one who has done more, per
haps, than any other one man in the
development of the educational
system of Michigan." He asks the
co-operation of every citizen in mak
ing October 13th, a worthy memorial
to the memory of the great Dr.
James B. Angell.
