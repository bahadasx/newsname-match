CUT BANK, TETON COUNTY, MONTANA, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1916.
Two Dollars Per Year
LIGHT MATTER
IN SUSPENSION
Council to Draw Up An
Ordinance to Submit
to Applicants
The electric light matter is
still suspended in space.
Monday night's mass meeting
brought out a number of citizens
who may be rated among the
town's heaviest taxpayers. The
two franchise applications were
discussed and the feeling pre
vailed that the rates set forth
were too high. The possibility
of the Great Falls Power Co.
extending its line from Conrad
was discussed and it was gen
erally agreed that this would
be greatly desired, but doubt
was expressed concerning the
possibility of this move for
many years and it was agreed
that Cut Bank was in need of a
lighting and power system right
now.
Martin Jacobson suggested
that the town, with the aid of
competent legal counsel, draw
up a franchise ordinance, em
bodying, the requirements
which citizens in the meeting
suggested, as to rates, term of
years and other important stip
ulations. A representative of
the Hawver interests, seek
ing afranchise. declared that if
these stipulations were within
reason his people would be glad
to accept the contract. The
council will meet Monday eve
ning and will Lake action to
ward having this ordinance
drawn.
The Pioneer Press has can
vassed sentiment on the light
question prettv thoroughly
and finds no opposition, on the
surface at least. On the contrary
it finds that the citizens of the
town favor it heartily and do
not wish to see thp matter post
poned, provided a contract safe
guarding the town's interests
can be closed.
NOTICE

will meet every Wednescay
evening hereafter at the Com
mercial club room. Every

man to be alone." invited the
Womens' Democratic club to aff

SPLENDID EXHIBITS AT

The second annual Black feet
fair, on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday of this week was
in every respect a splendid
event. The display of agricul

'rank outsider.' Products from

played in profusion and the

The cattle and horses, swine,
chickens, turkeys, geese and
ducks would take blue ribbons
at larger fairs. Of course the

kept the throng of people in

was a snap and a swing to the
entertainment that convinced
the spectators that the show
was under direction of the
Agency City's most competent
men and women.
The value of this fair, in the
incentive it offers in the wav of
better efforts toward grain and
stock culture, toward compe
tition in the exhilarating games
and sports, is incalcuable. The
fair, as an annual event will be
come greater and attract people
from all parts of the country.

Northern, and W. Bourke
Cochran, the noted New York
lawyer and orator.
Grain Prices
We note that the Great Falls
and other daily newspapers who
are printing articles from per
sons who ought to be qualified
to speak and who are no doubt
actuated by the highest of
motives, advising farmers to
hold their wheat for higher
prices than the prices that now
prevail. We are not so sure
that this is good advice. This
is a matter upon which we pro
fess little "expert" knowledge,
we are free to admit. It has
been our observation, however,
that farmers who thresh early
and market their grain early
ealize better profits year after
year than those who hold their
grain for months, perhaps until
out into the following year.
There are many things to be
considered—interest, shrinkage,
the possibility of fire, being >a
few. There are also inter
national considerations, such as
the fortunes of the big war. We
admit that the prospect at pre
sent certainly favors the ar
gument for a still higher price.
We are not endeavoring to in
fluence farmers to hold or to
sell. But they should well con
sider all the factors on both
sides of the matter and not be
influenced by such slogans as
$2.00 wheat."

BOOKS CLOSE
ON OCTOBER 7
Many In This Precinct
Have Not Registered
To Date
The registration books of
Teton county will close on Sept.
7th. It is probable that there
are 100 voters in the Cut Bank
precinct who did not register in
time for the primary election.
To those we would say: Reg
ister at the first opportunity.
We know of four or five who
delayed registering before the
primary and who regretted
their carlessness keenly when
they realized that they had
friends whom they desired to
help. So—well, you know—
but register today.
All who voted at the general
election in 1914 and have not
changed their address since that
time will not need to register
again in order to vote at the
election in November. However
if there is any doubt about the
address it w r ould be well to visit
the office of the registry and
agent and see if it is correctly
registered.
The women who have re
gistered since the equal suffrage
law went into effect will not
have to register again unless
they have changed their ad
dress.
A citizen who has changed
his address since registration,
unless his new residence is in
the same ward and precinct
where he formerly lived, must
have his adfires^ changed on the
register in order to vote. In
doing so he should simply notify
the clerk that the address is to
be changed and it will save him
much trouble.
Elevator for Kevin
\ nuinbet of Equity farmers

duly elected as president with Tom
Anderson vice president aud Harry

The Organization is truly ou a
strong foundation with an active
sincere and stroug Equity booster
as Harry llarte, for secretary.
Mr. Morion has made a general
study of co -operation and the
Equity plan and all feel the ele
