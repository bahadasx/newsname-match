Geo. Smith Bound
Over to Dist. Court
Trial in Justice Court Lasted
Four Days—Charged with
Murder of Horace
Ball.
After four days of strenuous
grinding in Justice Stoddard's
court, lasting from last Monday
mcjrning until last evening, in
which nine witnesses were used
and States Attorney C. L. Wal
dron assisted by Attorney De
Noyer appeared for the state and
Attorney Jones for the dr-is-idapt,
the Judge bound George Smith
over to the district court on a
charge of murdering Horace
Ball.
Our readers will remember
that Horace Ball met his death
through the explosion of dyna
mite, or some other explosive as
he was sleeping in his shack just
north of the Farmers Supply
Store, on the morning of July
19th, or the eve of July 18th. The
coroner's jury returned a verdict
of his having met his death al
the [hands of some unknown
1 tarty. Immediately after the
tragedy detectives were employed
and the evidence they seeurcd
brought about the arrest of Mr.
Smith and the trial of this week.
Spectators were barred from
the court chambers during the
last two days of the trial in Just
ice court, presumably because ev
idence of a sensational nature
was being introduced. From the
information we have been able
secure we believe that th case
in th district court next January
•will be of such a anture that a
portion of it may be held behind
closed doors.
The Horace Ball murder was
one of the most heinous of crimes
lo secure we believe that the ease
authorities have the right man
and are able to serure sufficient
evidence to convict him there is
no doubt but what he will re
ceive a long sentence. However,
it is not up to Mr. Smith to prove
himself guiltless, but instead the
state must prove him guilty, and
if the evidence is largely circum
stantial, strong as it may be, that
is a hard matter.
On Thursady, October 5, A. J.
Castner will sell at public auc
tion, on the NE 1-4 of Sec. 8, Twp.
138, Range 105, eight oniles
•south of Beach, all of his person
al property, including his house
hold goods. The list of articles
and live stock includes a large
number of horses, cattle, hogs,
considerable machinery, house
hold goods, etc. The sale will
start promptly at 10:00 A. M. and
a free lunch will be served at
noon as well as feed for the
horses. In next week's issue of
the Chronicle will appear a dis
play ad enumerating the articles
and live stock to be'sold and we
ask those of our readers who arc
in the market for essentials of
the farm to peruse it. Those
contemplating holding an auc
tion should do as Mr. Castner
has done, accept the advice
their friends who have had pre
vious experience in the auction
sale business and bring their ad
vertising to the Golden Valley
Chronicle. We guarantee the
circulation and that's what gels
the results.

A Newspaper that Causes Comment in a Town that is Talked About
STATE WIDE SCHOOL CORN
AND ALK4LFA hXHIBir.
"Why not a state wide school
corn and alfalfa exhibit during
Appreciation Week this year"
is the suggestion of Commission
er R. F. Flint of the stale depart
ment of agriculture. "If the
teachers of the various schools
would set aside a special day
during that week to hold an ex
hibit of corn and alfall'i and other
products of their disiricl it would
prove both interesting and valu
able. Suitable exercises, pro
grams and discussions could be
arranged and the patrons invited
to be present at the judging. The
best of these samples could then
Garrison and other places within
the state. Corn and alfalfa arc
valuable beyond estimation on
the farms of North Dakota there
fore such exhibits are of much
importance.'
"But the immesurablc greater
value of helping place North Da
kota before the nation as a corn
sending exhibits thus collected to
the First National Corn Show at
St. Paul in December."
Golden Valley American: Ed
mund Roby and Art Hclbing have
discovered some new specie of
water fowl that will be of interest
to naturalists and nature fakers.
From the discription we learn
that it is some kind of a Bur
banked duck. It looks like a
duck, has a bill like a chicken,
but seems to be adverse to fly
ing and hugs the water close.
These gentlemen succeeded in
capturing sixteen of the specie.
Killdeer is booming along at a
good rale. According to The
Herald of tliat place, improve
ments lo the amount of nearly
•$150,000 are being made this
year. Among the new buildings
are a new schoolhouse, Odd Fel
lows Hall, water works, light
lant and many business build
ings. And Killdeer is only two
years old.
Owing to the crowded condi
tion of the Dickinson school
buildings one of the rooms in the
armory is being used for school
purposes, a third grade being lo
cated in the guihling. When the
schools opened this gjrade had
an enrollment of 102.

BOTH SENATOR CANDIDATES
IN FARGO WED. PREPARE
TO OPEN VIGOROUS FIGHT.
Fargo, N. D. Sept. 20,—Two
United States senatorship can
didutes are in Fargo today, Por
ter J. McCumber, Republican no
inee, arrived in the city this af
ternoon from Whapeton, while
S. Treasurer .lohn Burke arrved
last night from Washington.
?5olh are preparing to enter
into an energetic campaign on
tiie theory of performance, the
present administration having
accomplished more real good for
the nation than any previous
administration,'' said Treasurer
Burke today. "That the people
are in favor of the progressive
legislation is certain.
Mr. Bur,ke will jump into a
general speaking campaign plans
for which are being laid today.
Last evening Mr. Burke met a
great number of local Democrats.
So far as the Democratic fac
tional contest is concerned, Mr.
Burke hopes to remain clear.
McCumber Optimistic
"I see no reason to believe that
North Dakota will go back on the
Republican ticket," said Senator
McCumber. "The issues as be
tween Republicanism and Dem
ocracy are very clear, and the in
terests of this state lie with the
Republican party.
"I expect, however, to make a
vigorous campaign, realizing the
kind of opposition I will have."
The farmers of the county
around Powers Lake are consid
ering the advisability of forming
a bank at Powers Lake. A meet
ing was held at that town recently
where the proposition was given
quite a boost.
Coming our way?
QF course you are. You

Thompson Yards Inc., En
courage Farmers in Corn
Growing.
What is probably one of the
largest prizes ever given for ten
ears of corn will be given away
by the Thompson Yards, Inc.,
this fall. !A *400 Wcyerhauser
Silo will lie given to the person
residing in North Dakota or the
northern part of South Dakota
who exhibits the best ten ears of
corn. There are absolutely no
restrictions placed upon the corn
growers by the Thompson Yards.
All that is necessary for the eon
'eslant to do is to select the ten
best ears he can find and take
them to the local manager of
Thompson Yards, where they
will be properly labelled and sent
to the contest without any ex
pense whatever. The silo will
be erected on the farm of the
winner This prize, in connec
tion with other prizes that are
being offered by different inter
ests in the stale certainly should
stimulate interest in corn raising
and ensilage feeding. The Chron
icle hopes that Golden Valley
corn growers will make selec
tions and enter samples of their
corn in this contest. We believe
it would be possible for some
Golden Vaiiey farmer lo win this
silo and at the same time the
exhibits will give the country
much valuable advertising.
