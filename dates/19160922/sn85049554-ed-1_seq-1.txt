MASS. MEETING OF
CHICAGO WOMEN
Called to Consider Advance of Bread
to 6 Cents Per Loaf—Petitions Being
Circulated in New York Asking
President to Call Congress in Special
Session to Enact Law Placing Em
bargo on Exportation of Foodstuffs.
Chicago, Sept, 22.—Housewives of
Chicago were called upon today to at
tend a mass meeting at which organi
zation Will be perfected to fight in
creases in prices of foodstuffs.
The announcement that bread -is to
be advanced from 5 to 6 cents a loaf
resulted in the call for the meeting.
."Men are' interested in buying and
selling for a profit. It is therefore
folly to expect them to take any
action." the call reads. "Women must
put a stop to unwarranted increases
and we alone can stop them."
The long discussed advance in the
price of bread will go into effect next
Thursday.
The Ward Baking Company an
nounced yesterday that after Sept. 28
the present 5-cent loaf will retail for
6 cents. For those who still prefer to
buy bread in nickel quantities, a
smaller loaf will be manufactured,
which will be several ounces lighter
just how much John W. Hines, gen
eral manager of the company, refused
to say.
"We haven't anything to add to the
announcement, which has been in
closed with each loaf of bread," he
said last night.

next Monday. Sept. 25. All loaves will
be 10 cents afteif that date. The de
cision follows that made at the Chi

Clinton breadmakers announce that
they will welcome a federal investiga
tion of their action.
Predicts Drop in Potatoes.
Sioux City, Sept. 22.—A decline In
the price of potatoes as soon as the
offerings of Minnesota and Colorado
arrive is predicted by ccmmission men.
The fact that the crop' of these two
states Is to be large has had the effect
of lowering the price already.
^Tactically all of the potatoes this
year will have to come from western
states. The crop in the irrigated ter
ritory will be larse. All potatoes
shipped can be depended.upon as be
ing first class, commission men assert.
A decline in the price of sugar will
make it possible for housewiyee to
(take
advantage of the "last stand" of
peaches and pears for canning pur
poses. The high price o"f sugar Has
cut down canning activities In the
homes this year, dealers say.
Sugar now'ls selling for $7.35 a sack.
Peaches and pears still are on the
market but tHis will be the last week
for them, it is said. There probably
will be no advaiicc in price '^ntil the
crop is finished.

after a final effort to arrange a peace
ful settlement had failed and following
the declaration that a general strike

this city last Saturdav. General Tre
vino, commander of the Carranza army
of the north, today Issued a statement
to the Associated Press, in which he
described it as a "tissue of lies of
falsehoods."
"I am at a loss to know where Gen
eral Bell obtained such bad informa
tion,"- he continued. "The Vlllistas
carried absolutely nothing away with
them except some of tho^ prisoners
from the penitentiary. They captured
neither ammunition, cannon nor any
thing else.
"Our artillery drove the Villii'las ou'.
of the palace, which they had taken,
and pursued them, leaving no time for
them to carry anything away."
General Trevino asserted that every
unit of his service was co-ordinated
that all prisoners examined by him
agreed that Villa's band numbered not
more than 600. and that all of the
automobiles in the city are accounted
for, none being carried away by the

report was founded on fact and not
'oased on border rumors.
Funston Credits Report.

ston today said he put credence in the
report of Villa's attack on Chihuahua
City from General Bell. He said the
information had come dirpct from
Chihuahua. City This statement said
that Villa was victorious and that
many of the Carranza soldiers bad
joined the bandit army.
"General Bell's report was made on
interviews had by officers of the army
intelligence department with persons
who fled from Chihuahua City and was
not liasfd on border rumors." said
General .Funston. "Of course the army
had no representative in Chihuahua
and could gkt no first hand detafls."
There are now about 5.000 federal
troops in Chihuahua City, according to
General Pershing. The large portion
of these are reinforcements rushed in
from the south after the battle.
General Funston also explained an
announcement by tr. J. B. Gambrell,
corresponding secretary of the Bap
tist general conference of Texas. at
Dallas, last night, quoting General
ordering that Baptist preach­
ers might preach to the soldiers pro
viding that they did not tell them they
were "lost." General Funston said he
objected to revivals being held in the
camps and found particularly obnox
ious any supposition that army men
should be special objects of evangel
ism.
HVo have a fine lot of men, equal to
artv othrr la^s of men in the country."
he^said, "I don't believe they should
be considered as being 'lost.'
