Undaunted by the warning of the

This was Frayne'a parting shot as he

"We have made no threats of dis

Sending Men to War
Some Civic and Social Leaders Would Take, Up
Arms Themselves Others Favor Compulsory-Training
to Conscription.
Still Others Would Arbitrate.
Would youa ivoman vote
your son to war?
That is a hard question. But it is the question women of
Australia will be called upon to answer.
In Aubtralia women have the vote. The Australian House
of Representatives has decided upon a referendum on conscrip
tion. Therefore, for the first time in the world's history,
women will have to cast a ballot on whether their men shall
go to war.
To bring this question home, The Times asked a group of
prominent w'omen in Washington what they would do if they
had to vote on the war proposal. Some of them arc clubwomen,
others are suffragists, some are known as authorities on public
questions.
The ansioers vary. Some admit they do not believe in
"peace at any price," but they woidd not compel men to fight.
One woman advocates universal military service as a pre
ventive of war, and points out that such service woidd eliminate
the conscription issue in cas6 of war.
Here is what they say:
WHAT WASHINGTON WOMEN SAY.
Mrs. Margarita S. Gerry, mem
ber Board of Education and au
thor: I have not thought of conscription
as such, but I have given much
thought to compulsory military ser
vice. That Is a greater Issue In this
country, of course, since we are
not at war.
I heartily favor universal military
service. I believe It Is the only
way In which we cun hate an ade
quate and well-trnlncd army. 1 be
lieve It would lead to peace.
It 1h doubtful whether, If we hod
the full t length of this country's
manhood trained for rnich service,
any nation would dare attack us.
Isolated as wo are from the rest
of the world.
A year's nilUtarjr service tffi
ii'ounr inniw would .mean thiv maKlu,
of him. I would be perfectly will
ing for my son to give up a. year
of his life to actlvo military train
ing. Obviously. If we had compulsory
universal military service in ime
of peace we would not need con
scription In time of war.
Mr. Court F. Wood, president
of the District of Columbia Fed
eration of Women's Clubs:
I certainly would not vote for con
scription. Jf a man did not have
enough patrl-.s to go to war If
his country sd him he could
stay homo so t ' I am concerned.
