Fifth Annual C >unty Fair Sets The
Record For Attendance And
Is A Big Success.
Agricultural Exhibits And Others Are Numerous
The Fifth Annual Fallon Coun-!
ty Fair, the institution that re
cords the growth and prosperity
of every community within the
county and promotes the agri
cultural and live stock industries,
came to a close Wednesday even
ing. From the point of attend
ance this year's fair established
the record and it will further
carry with it the distinction of
being the first and only affair of
its kind in Ekalaka that was a
success financially. Heretofore,
the fair books showed a deficit
following these celebrations but
at this time the Association finds
itself with enough funds to pay
all expenses incurred and a few
dollars to call its own. In years
gone by we have held successful
fairs and celebrations but in each
instance every dollar received
was always returned to the
visitors in the way of entertain
ments. Owing to the liabilities
incurred in the erection of the
new grand stand and other build
ings last year, every effort was
made to make this year's event
a financial success and still retain
the "Pup-town" reputation for
entertainment and hospitality.
The great and appreciative suc
cess of Tuesday's and Wednes
day's celebration was not due en
entirely to the efforts of the fair
association members. To the
people of Fallon County, especial
ly those who assisted with the
agricultural display in entering
their exhibits much credit is due.
While this section of the state
was not blessed with its usual
amount of precipitation or grade
of weather the past year, never
theless the exhibits were surpris
ing and much favorable comment
was heard from all sides on the
showing made, Considering the
time allotted Superintendent
Wm. Gerner to gather the exhib
its and arrange the display we
feel that a great deal of credit is
entitled him and we know that
his interest in the fair has been
a self-sacrificing effort and that
the visitors to the agricultural
hall were appreciative of his
work. The Home Department
under the supervision of Mrs. J.
W. Ewalt contained a most inter
esting collection of exhibits, very
neatly arranged and a source of
much favorable comment. The
exhibits in the educational de
partment were indeed numerous,
the entire collection having been
gathered by Miss Annette Lean
ord, county superintendent of

schools who was
in charge.
In
this department the work of the
of the school children was dis
played and the parents have ev
ery reason to feel proud of their
youngsters.
In commending on the person
nel of the fair management it is
but fitting that a word of praise
be accorded President J. W.
Grant. From the very start of
making the fair a success he has
had his shoulder to the wheel and
at all times his pleasing person
ality has won the respect of the
visitor. Under his supervision
the program was carried through
without a hitch or an accident of
any kind, the different events
being staged with promptness
and without the "rag chewing"
that usually comes at such time'.
F. M. Dworshak assumed the
duties of Secretary Mowbray,
who was absent during the fair,
and handled this work with dis
patch. In fact, nearly everyone
had his public spirited working
clothes on and fell to work on the
many "thankless" jobs. It was
a dandy fair, the biggest and
we hope to be able to repeat the
performance next year to as large
a gathering of visitors as entered
the grounds this week.

New Paper Appear?
"The-Beaver Valley l'res. : ,
the second newspaper for Eka
laka made its initial appearance
Friday of last week. It comes
to the people of this section as
an exponent of the platform of
the republican party and the
many G. 0. P. candidates, know
ing that the best and most proper
place for launching such an en
terprise would be in the heart of (
the democratic stronghold of Fal- ;
Ion County. We don't believe ;
the voters of this section especial
ly the democrats, are going to
fall for their line of "helpful
hints," especially if they are to
compare with the campaign
speeches of their chosen leader,
Charles E. Hughes. Anyhow,
we greet the new paper and with
the growth of eastern Montana
may it also prosper. The new
visitor does not mention the per
sonnel of its ownership or editor
and publisher, hence no personal
greetings can be extended.
Our Apology.

The Eagle is not up to standard
this week. You know it and so
do we, but the fact of the matter
is, we have had a fair, and like
many other we tried to do our
share in making it a success. Our
time for visiting and meeting our
many friends who were here was!
very limited but at that we ap-;
pre-date,! what few times we did j
find to extend greetings. The!
country editor is expected to re- !
cord the various happenings of!
his community and the coming j
and going of visitors but we are j
going to ask ycu to forgive us |
this time if we have overlooked {
any small items of interest. If
you wer, 1 here fair time, we know j
that you will do this. We are!
not going to try and tell you who ;
all were here; it would be much !
easier to list the absent ones.

inated in the marketing of grain;

mission to deal with taxation and

statuatory laws as may be ade
quate to equalize taxes; favors
oudget system for expenditure of
public money, a system already
-vorking in the educational insti
tution of the state; favors state j
wide urohibition when it comes j
oefore congress. !

jf the administrations of Govern- ;
or Stewart and President Wilson
and President Wilson and the !
vvork of Senators Myers and

nost enthusiastic and most har
nonious in the history of the!
party. The platform over which
it was expected there would be a|
ight on one or two planks was
adopted unanimously amid!
cheers.

speech was received with great
enthusiasm as were the speeches
of Former Governor Norris, Del
egates Hartmen of Bozeman,

chairman of the convention and
oy Thomas Arthur, retiring chair
man of the state central commit
tee, who was given a vote of

the past two years.
There were more than 200 del- !
egates from every quarter of the
state, every county being well I
represented. There were hun- '
dreds of spectators who came to ;
Helena to witness the proceed- I
ings. The hotels were crowded
