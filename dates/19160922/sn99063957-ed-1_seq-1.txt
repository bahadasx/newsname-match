; In Carpathians
London, Sept. 22. ' Under heavy Russo-Rumanian
hammer blows, the Teutonic forces in Dobrudja have fal
len back more than five miles and are still in retreat, said
Bucharest dispatches today.
An earlier official statement reported the Bulgarians
burning villages and ravaging the country as they fell
back. The official statement also reported the capture of
Szekely Udvarhely, an industrial town of about 8,000 in
habitants, forty five miles inside the Transylvanian
frontier.
Sofia dispatches today admitted that the German-Bul-gar
attacks against the Russo-Rumanian line have been
unsuccessful and that the Rumanians have gained a little
' ground at some points. An official statement issued at
Sofia made no mention of a Bulgarian retirement but re
ported that, the Bulgars are consolidating their positions
in the Dobrudia.
The defeat of Field "Marshal Mackensen in the Do
brudia invasion and the check administered to the Aus
tt-o-Germans on the northwestern frontier of Rumania
has caused a renewal of the demand here for a settlement
of affairs at Athens.
It is no longer any secret that the new Greek cabinet
is not regarded as favorable to the allies; English cor
.respondents at Athens cabled today that it was highly
-improbable that the allies would be able to enter into
cordial relations with the new ministry. Reports have
reached here1 that the revolts which have broken out in
isolated parts of Greece may mean the beginning of a
real revolution headed by E-Fremier vemzelos to over
throw King Constantine and bring Greece into the war.
A wireless disoatch from Rome this afternoon report
ed that the Russo-Rumanians have won victories in the
Dobrudja and Transylvania and that the Russians are

Tho sentiment as they went into their
secret meeting seemed to favor the vot

their fight which tho leaders regard
as involving the entire question of the

jority of tho lenders apparently were,
in favor of union men nnd women in a

sympathy for the carmen by remaining
away from work until tho traction trou
ble is satisfactorily settled. Tho only
question appeared to be whether th
walkout would take the form of an ac

and backed up by a novel plan which
would have the same effect as a strut

By Ed L. Keen,
(I'nited Press Staff Correspondent.)
London, Sept. 22. Germany will set
another peace kite flying about the
middle of October, British officialdom,
both military and civil confidently
expects.
Ueeeut apparently well authenticat
ed rumors have reached London that
Germany, suffering huge losses be
cause of the recent allied offensive, is
endeavoring to suggest an nrmistic
through Spain or the I'nited Stutes.
It is understood in reliable authority
that King Alfonso so far Is unrespon
sive and is unlikely to act. The Ger
mans, it believed here, hope to at
tempt President Wilson to start nego
tiations nt the time when any attend
ant success would be likely to effect
favorably his chances of re-election.
Americans conversant witn inside
British opinion feel certain that any
such move ou the part of Washington
would not only be foredoomed to fail
ure but would arouse the most bitter
resentment of the allies and also per
manently eliminate Washington as a
nt.ttnnitl mediator.
Kvery indication points not only to
the oneness of purpose of all the al
li... to continue the war until a de
cisive peace i obtainable, but to tho
fact Hint the army, the navy and
political lenders ere thoroughly united
in the determination to assume respon
sibility if necessary for the war's con
tinuation after Germany is willing to
quit. If this does become necessary
they will leave it to history to justify
the additional carnago In tho interests
of the removul of the menace of mill
tarvism. It is no secret that the Anglo
French, are prepared both in numbers
and munitions to continue the present
offensive indefinitely regardless of
winter weather. Although thero was
much nervousness a year ago when any
definite peace proposals from Germany
on a basis merely of abandonment of
the occupied territory might have been
considered sympathetically by the
military authorities in view of the real
Preeari'ousness of the situation, they
feel thnt now everything favors tue
allies and that such an abandonment
of occupied territory would only be to
Germany's advantage, enannng ner to
shorten and strcnirthen her lines.
British soldiers' only worry now Is
nnnaildn over ontlmism of civilians be
cause of their recent successes and
those confidently expected in the
future. They realize that the Germans
