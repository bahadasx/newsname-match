ENLARGING ROUNDHOUSE.
Grand Trunk Railway Slaking
Extensive Repairs and More
Room for Their Motive
Power.
Work is going rapidly on in the
Grand Trunk railway yards occupied
by the roundhouse and repair shop.
The plant is already equipped with
the latest appliances but to facilitate
the handling and care of the large
locomotives the building is being en
larged and other equipments put
in shape.
The outer wall of the roundhouse
is being extended fifteen feet on six
teen of the twenty stalls. A water
pump is being added and the turn
table enlarged to take on the large
locomotives. These repairs and im
provements will add to the conveni
ence of the work of caring for the
motive power and help to maintain
that efficiency and safety which this
railways places first and foremost in
the operation of its great transcon
tinental system.
All the buildings of the plant are
well kept and the yards show a
thorough system of order and neat
ness. The yard office has a well-kept
lawn and little"plots of grass and
plants add to the the pleasant sur
rounding of the plant, something
not generally seen around similar
shops.
DISTRIBUTING POINT.
Wholesale Grain Firm Plan to
Make Island Pond a Dis
tributing Point.
Holway Company, Auburn, Me.,
wholesale flour, grain and feed
dealers, have been making Island
Pond a point for the reshipment of
flour and feed. The business has
been so favorable as to cause the
firm to make plans for enlarging
their storehouse and make this a
distributing point.
The business of the Holway Co.,
at Island Pond is looked after by
Frank Paquette, jr. Tuesday Mr.
Coombs of Auburn, Me., of the
firm of Holway Co., was in town
and took up the matter of enlarg
ing their plant here, with Mr.
Paquette. Their plans are to
double the capacity of the store
house, making it large enough to
hold fifty carloads of flour, grain
and feed. This work is favorably
considered by the company and it
is hoped it will materialize and
make a permanent business at Is
land Pond. If this work is done
as planned it will be of great con
venience to dealers in this vicinity
for they can get much quicker
shipments and lower rates, and in
fact have a wholesale firm within
easy reach.

BENNINGTON MURDER.
Body of William Costello Found
with Bullet Holes in Head
Slayer at Large.
The body of William Costello, 32,
who was employed in the washing
room of the Holden Leonard Co.
Woolen Mill of Bennington, was
found on the trolley tracks Saturday
night with two bultet holes in the
back of the head. The county and
local officials, with no apparent clue
to guide them are endeavoring to
run down the young man's murder
er. Costello was seen at the Ameri
can House bar-room at nine o'clock
Saturday night. Half an hour later
he was lying dead beside the Ben
nington and North Bennington trol
ley track nearly a half a mile from
the hotel. It was midnight.however,
before the officers were informed of
the tragedy. Drunken men along
the line of the trolley tracks are no
uncommon sight Saturday nights
and it was not until a drunk at the
Soldiers' Home crossing had been
reported by several crews that a car
was stopped for investigation. When
the car reached the village a passen
ger told Chief of Police Brazil that
he thought there was a dead man
near the track and when the officer
reached the scene the passenger's
suspicions were confirmed
State's Attorney Frank C. Archi
bald, who lives at Manchester, 25
miles north of Bennington, arrived
early Monday morning by auto
mobile and took charge of the in
vestigation. Dr. B. H. Stone of
Burlington, the State's pathologist,
reached Bennington Monday after
noon, to perform the autopsy. One
of the bullets struck the side of Coc
tello's neck and came out through
the upper lip. The other penetrated
back of the head at the base of the
brain, probably causing instant
death.
Nothing in the nature of a clue
developed during the day except the
finding of five empty 32-calibre re
volver shells near a watering trough
about a hundred yards from the
spot where the body was discovered.
The night watchman at the Benning
ton Scale company's plant.the build
ing nearest the scene of the tragedy,
states that he heard five shots in
quick succession about 9:30 in the
evening.
Costello was an inoffensive fellow
and not disposed to be quarrelsome
even when under the influence of
liquor.
