belongs exclusively the work of mercy.
France, Uussia, Englnnd, Germany

In the Ottoman Hod Crescent, a Ma
hommedan equivalent of the Bed
Cross, even the Turks have a corps of
mercy workers, to render aid to those
Injured In battle. But not only the
belligerent nations are occupied In the
field of mercy toward fallen fighters.
America, with all the cheerful optim
ism which characterizes her people,
has worked vigorously to alleviate the
sufferings of the wounded soldiers in
France.
Distant Abyssinia, too, was one of
the first neutral countries to establish
a place of succor for the Injured near
the firing line. Indeed, the Anglo
Ethiopian hospital at Prevent, pro
vided with funds supplied by the Abys
tlan crown prince, did great service
early In the war. Japan, representing
the far East, also sent a wonderfully
since occupied the Hotel Astoria,
Paris. Dainty women and intellectu
al men have given their time and their
services eagerly in the cause of hu
manity. The ladles of the Busslan court,
self-sacrificing in the extreme, have
been trained for hospital work In the
field. They have performed duties at
which men might shudder and they
have performed them well. So It is In
France and England and In the other
countries, both In und out of the war.
That the majority of the workers have

Automobile Great Help.
Like the aeroplane, the automobile
Is a new departure, a very important
one, In wurfare. Since August, 1914,
it mis played many parts. Armored
cars, transport lorries and other vehi
cles directly and Indirectly contribut
ing to the success of the different arm
ies In the field, have established a
fresh reputation for the motor indus
try. But It Is largely owing to the
motor ambulance that the noble work
of mercy bus been possible.
So far as Great Britain Is concerned,
the motor ambulance service owes its
existence and its triumph to Lord
Derby's brother, Hon. Arthur Stanley,
U- P, chairman of the British Bed
Cross society, and also to the Boyal
Automobile club. Soon after the out
break of war, In September, 1014, Mr.
Stanley, quick to see the possibilities
of the motor ambulance, was given a
Permit to send one or two out to the
'wnt by the late Lord Kitchener.
"The actual permit," said Mr. Stan

"One of the first things I did on re-

continued Mr. Stnnley, "was to get to-

Proves Its Worth.
'With the possible excentlnn nf tlm
American ambulance cars at Neullly,
ours were the first motor ambulance
used in France. But the value of a
rapid service for the transport of
wounuea sokllcrs wus quickly recog
nized, and now, of course, wherever
tuere is fighting there are motor am
bulances."
Here Is a typical Instance, ns told
by Mr. Stanley, how the motor ambu
lance proved Its worth In the early
unys of the war
'Late one evening one of our nmhn-
lances crept up close to the firlne line.
They met an officer, who turned them
back 'because,' as he said, 'It Is so
dark, it is no use going further.'
'They went back to a farmhouse and
to bed. In the middle of the nicht
they were awakened by the same offi
cer, who told them that a wounded
soldier, shot through both lees, was
lying almost In the German lines. It
was so dangerous a mission that the
officer wouldn't order the ambulance
to go I He Just told them where the
man was, and left them to decide
They went They crawled, without
lights, along an unknown road In the
uarunes8; got almost within the Ger
man lines, where they found the man
and brought him back to safety. That
wounded soldier had Iain there for
days and would most certainly have
died had he not been rescued thut
night.
"In this modest nnd voluntary way
the motor ambulance enrue info Its
own without one penny of cost to the
government !
'Today," went on Mr. Stnnley. "there
are about 1,600 motor ambulances and
cars ut the French front alone. An
other 1,000 are scuttered about with
the troops in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Sa
lonlki, Malta, East Africa, etc. We
have three ambulance convoys each
one consisting of some sixty cars and
a radiographing convoy working in
Italy. We have a number of cars in
Petrograd and on the western Busslan
front, while we recently sent a small
convoy as a present to Grand Duke
Nicholas In the Caucasus."
"Up to the present," snld Mr. Stan
ley, "we have collected over S2O.0OO.000
for the Bed Cross nnd St. John's Am
bulance society. The money comes In
nt the rate of about $5,000,000 every
six months. This shows the public
appreciation of the work. Our support
comes from ail sections of society."
"As un instance of the diversity of
our work, It may be Interesting to note
that we arranged the other day to send
motor boats to Mesopotamia and
'Chnrlie Chaplin' films to Malta, this
latter for the amusement of the con
valescent soldiers I
"One of the outstanding features of
our organization has been the splendid
work done by the women."
Mr. Stunley mentioned, bv the wuv.
the excellent artificial limbs for
maimed soldiers produced by Amerl
mnn nfnnufncturers. both In the Unit

the organization over which Mr. Stnn
ley presides, is the American Volun
teer Motor Ambulance corns, vet an
other body of mercy-workers. In Sep
tember, 1914, Prof. Blchard Norton of
Harvard university saw for himself
the plight of the wounded French sol
diers, who suffered additionally
through Inudenunte means of trans
portation. Consequently, with the co
operation of some of his friends, he
started the American Volunteer Am
bulance corps, which quickly widened
its field from two cars to seventy-five.
OrlglnaMy composed of American nnd
British members, the corns has. while
always working in conjunction with
the French army, been placed under
the British Bed Cross owing to Ques
tions of American neutrality.
The volunteers of the Amerlcnn Mo
tor Ambulance corps have given the
time and their services uncomplaining
ly to the attainment of an excellent
object. Under the chairmanship of
the late Henry James, the novelist,
who directed matters from London,
many young college graduates freely
entered the corps to work strenuously,
without pay or preferment. Professor
Norton, Bldgely Carter, Sir John Wolfe
Berry, Jordan L. Nott. John Dixon
Morrison nnd many other well-known
men are members of the London coun
cil. Mr. Norton and several of the
men have been awarded the Croix de
Guerre and the Croix d'Armee, the for
mer ranking high lu the honors of war-
rlng and republican France. Work
ing close up to the firing line, the
American Motor Ambulance men have
brought relief to many thousands of
wounded nnd sick soldiers. Some

Chief Meyers has come Into his own.
Discarded by John McGraw as
"through," looked upon by Polo
Grounds fans as a once great catcher
who had slipped back Immeasurably,
the chief has accomplished a wonder
ful comeback and is an Idol In Brook
lyn. It is an admitted fact that a player,
grown stale, will often stage a start
ling change In form when be dons the
uniform of another team, and this Is
exactly what has happened In the case
of John Tories Meyers, the college
bred aborigine.
The chief has had a rather pic
turesque career. A graduate of Dart
mouth, he took a three-year post-graduate
course In baseball In the mlnof
leagues and came to the Giants from
St. Paul In 1908, costing the club $6,
000. At Mnrlln In. the spring of 1909
he jumped Into the limelight as u
long-distance hitter and was received
by the New lork fans with open
arms. Personality, a quality In which
so many players are lacking, stuck oul
all over the chief, and for six yean
he was one of the most popular play
ers who ever wore a Giant uniform.
It was last year that Meyers save
the first Indication that he was slip

the part of the fans when the Indian
was sent to Brooklyn and Bill Barlden
was signed to take his place. In 110
games last year he hit the ball for an
average of exactly .232, and it ap
peared that he was about ripe for the
minors.
Then came the transformation, not

A couple of the Athletic players were

"Not exactly," said Connie Mack.
"Cobb makes his luck. If he hits the

goes to first base like a deer. He hur
ries the lnfielder and If he boots the
ball, makes a wide throw, or the first

eral years the players have been reap
ing a harvest The natural advance
ment of the game and the Increase of
the profits of the magnates caused the
salaries of players to mount rapidly,
nnd then came the war between or
ganized ball and the Feds.
The players took, advantage of the
conditions and held the magnates up
for salaries all out of proportion to
their value, with the result that the
majority of the clubs lost money In
1914 and 1915. There was nothing
left for organized ball to do but make
peace with the Federal league, and
ine retrenchment policy was adopted
by the magnates. Almost every star
player of the two Major leagues was
tieo up to two or three-yeur contracts,
the majority of which expire at the
close of the present season, and the
players now are hustling. In recent
years the players refused to take any
unnecessary chances. They were con
tent to draw their salaries and pre
ferred to take no chances on Injuries,
realizing that a serious accident would
hurt their earning capacity.

there would be a general cut in sal
