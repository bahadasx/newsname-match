COST OF IMPROVEMENT
ON CALIFORNIA STREET
Road Is Now Oonipleted A Needed
('ounet'tliiK Link.
Tho recent improvement on Cali
fornia street, which connects tho
Wnrron-Wcst St. Holens roads, !
now completed. , Many havo asked
the Mist the cost of the Improvement,
and by tho kindness of Roadmaster
Abry we are able to furnish our read
ers with the following data i.s to Us
cost;
Clearing and grubbing. . . .$ 14. CO
Labor grading 774.00
Macadamising 105.00
Fuel 19.00
Powder, fuse, etc 122.48
Distillate 6.74
711 yds. rock at 68c 412.28
Total 11,447.07
The road Is 14 feet wldo and about
2,300 feet long. The amount ap
propriated for this road at the bud
get meeting was f 1,1 60, so the cost
has exceeded tho appropriation by
nearly $200. Moreover, tho over
head expenses, cuch as salaries of
roadmustor, road supervisor, etc., Is
not Included. If tho total cost was
figured, In all probability, tho cost
would run close to $1,800. From
time to time tho Mint will give costs
of certain pieces of road so our read-
era and the taxpayors can keep In
formed t to the expenditure of tholr
moaoy.
A SERIES OF
MINOR ACCIDENTS
Fay Plunk, night engineer at the
Columbia County Lumber Company
mill, coming In contact with a supply
wire Monday night, recelvod a heavy
charge of electricity which rendered
him unconscious for a short time.
He was not oeriously Injured and will
be able to resume his duties in a few
days.
Tuosduy morning at 4 o'clock, E.
E. Long, who la on tho night shift
at tho shipyards, was painfully In
jured when a timber on the rollers
ready for the band saw rolled off and
struck htm, breaking his leg at the
thigh. Dr. L. O. Roes waa called and
gave tho injured man temporary re
lict and ho was later sect to a Port
land hospital, whore at last reports
ho is getting along nicely.
John Phillips, another employe of
tho shipyards, mot with a pclnful
accident Tuosday whoa his anr.tomy

Ills Injuries, however, nro nothing
more than a broken rib and bruises,

INFORMATION AS
TO ROAD MATTERS
County Roadmaster Abry has re
turned from tho lower end of the
county where, for several days, he
has been going over the highway and
the' vcrlous ronda now under con
struction. In company with , Amos
Benson, A. E. Harvey and Mr. Pur
cell, county bridge builder of Mult
nomah county, they went over that
portion of the highway from Delena
to Inglls, a distance of about six
miles. The highway follows the Bea
ver canyon, and there aro to be ten
bridges In this six miles. It Is plan
ned to build only temporary bridges,
tho coHt of which Is estimated at
$10,000. A logging railroad now
operating in that vicinity will soon
suspend operations and several of
tholr bridges will be used on the
road. Mr. Abry thinks this can be
done at a small cost, as it is only
necessary to widen the railroad
bridges in order to use them on the
county road. The improvements con
teraplated on this six-mile stretch of
road will cost about $40,000, and it
Is the supposition that the stato will
pay $20,000 of It. A. S. Bonson will
advance the necessary funds so that
work can be vigorously prosecuted,
and when the funds aro available the
state will reimburse him.
Men, teams and material are boing
gotten together, and If favorable wea
ther continues much work is expect
ed. Mr. Abry stated that he hoped
to have the road opon for traffic be
fore the coming summer. Mr. Pur
cell will have charge of the construc
tion of the bridges. Othor work In
this vicinity Is progressing satisfac
torily, according to Mr. Abry.

According to Judge Hattan there is
about $9,000 of tho general fund on
the tax rolls and warrants amount
ing to $2,000 have beon drawn
against this. Most of the balance
will then be shifted to the road dis
tricts to pay for bridges and other
contract work which have been paid
out of the district funds. It will be
soon that road dlutrict No. 2, in
which St. Helens Is located, has spent
the most, while Nos. 3 and 4 are
close runners up. Road districts
Nos. 6 and 7 are in the best shape,
for in addition to the amount shown
in the above table as on hand they
have about $12,000 of a special
fund, about one-half of which is col
lected with, nothing paid out from
tho fund.
A statement of resources and lia
bilities of the general fund Is also
furnished, which shows that if all
the back taxes are collected that
fund would still have a balance on
hand,

It is finrdly possible that the en

$30,000, will be collected. The In
debtedness at January 1, 1917, will
be about the amount of the sinking
fund, and if this should be used to
call in warrants there will be no
outstanding warrants except that the
general fund will then owe the sink
ing fund tho amount. However, the
bonds must be paid, and It la a wise
IdGa to keep the sinking fund intact.
STREET AND SCHOOL
SIGNS BEING PLACED
The sigus recently ordered by the
council have been finished and are
being placed by Marshal Southard.
On the corner of Columbia and St.
Helens streets is a sign which tells
the automoblllst there is a school
nearby and to be careful. Similar
signs have bien placed on Oak street
JuRt before the road turns into St.
Helens street. A dozen signs giving
the names of the streets have also
been placed at conspicuous corners.
Several signs which point out the
Astoria-Goble road have been placed
where motorists cannot fall to see
them.
STORES WILL CLOSE
THIS AFTERNOON
In order to give their employes an
opportunity to visit the county fair,
most of the St. Helens business
houses will close tholr doors at 1
o'clock. The public schools will be
closed for the entire day, so that
the children can tako part in the
exercises, which promise to be one
of tho main attractions of tho fair.
A very complete program has been
prepared and the largest crowd to yet
pass in tho gates 1b expected.
