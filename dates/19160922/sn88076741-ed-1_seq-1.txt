Again the English and French made
decided gains in the Somme region dur
ing the closing days of last week. The
ground gained is on about a six mile
front and nearly a mile deep for most of
the distance. At each end of the line
of advance are pojnts vhich have held
out ever since the tirst advance in the
beginning of July Thiepal on the left
and Perrone on the right. But the pre
sent advance partially encircles both
these points, which the Germans having
strongly fortified still hold. During the
last few days heavy rains have delayed
further operations in this locality.
From the Balkans come conflicting
stories whieh perhaps could be recoo*
ciled if the dates were specific. There
are several armies facing each other at
different points and these are evidently
attacking and counter attacking with
varying results. In a general way the
Serbians with their French and English
allies are making considerable progress
in advancing from Greece into Serbia,
while in the southeast along the Black
sea the Bulgarian and Turks are claim
ing advantages. In Transylvania to the
north, the Russians and Roumanians
are apparently at a standstill. The
fighting has been intense insevsral parte
of this much fought over land.
The Galician and Poland battle lines
each report suecess and large numbers
of prisoners being taken. But the maps
do not show advances. Lemberg is still
'sixty miles away1' from the Russians
with the Russians fighting to get there,
while the German-Austrians are fighting
stubbornly to prevent future progress
by the Slavs.
Features of the later battles are the
increased use of aeroplanes as war wea
pons. The English and French have
apparently increased their air fleets in
very large numbers. Battles of air
fleets are now becoming common as
many as twenty or thirty of these air
ships taking part. The allies now claim
a great superiority in this sort of war
fare.
During the last week's operations a
new instrument of warfare was introduc
ed and the English claim it to be a re
markable success. It is an Armored
tractor engine of the "caterpiller" type.
This is the kind of tractor that carries
a sort of endless belt, which runs be
neath the wheels and lays abroad track
on which the wheels of the tractor run.
The British have taken these tractors
which are said to be American made,
and which they have heretofore used to
tow large gun carriages, and built them
up with armor plate which is strong
enough to resist musket and machine
gun fire, armed them with rifled guns
and quick fire machine guns and sent
them into battle in advance of the infan
try. The reports are these "tanks"
literally walk over the roughest sort of
ground, over trenches, walls and fences
with little or no difficulty. They also
claim that these new machines are very
eflective and particularly demoralizing
to the enemy. Perhaps these reports
are somewhat exaggerated, but it looks
sb
though the aeroplanes in the air and
the submarines in the seas had now a
big brother on the ground.

SECOND CHAPTER.
We reproduce the statistics given us
by Auditor Felson from last week's is
sue for reference as we wish to call at
tention to some other phases of taxation.
Perhaps the most striking item of
these statistics is the comparatively
large proportion of taxes paid by real
estate, this being seventy-one per cent
of the total valuation. It looks from
this that it would not be a very great
step for this county (and the figures are
approximately about the same propor
tion for the whole state) to go on to the
single tax theory of Henry George. So
far as real estate itself is concerned, it is
visible and its values pretty well approxi
mated, consequently the bulk of our
taxation must be fairly well divided^
among theTaxpaying owners.
It is therefore also conclusive that the
inequalities, such as they are, must bo
found among the different classes of per-,
sonal property. But here again we find
that a large part is visible and material
and is assessed ahd taxed fairly equable
manner. First we find that moire than
one half of all personal property in the
county consists of railroads, telephone
and similarpropertyvbeingaboui fifteen
per cent of the total county assessment
Whether this assessment is sufficient,
and equable with other classes of pro
perty is a matter of private opinion, pro
vided the private opinion is based on
known facts. Some years ago a railway
manager was quoted as saying that be
made freight rates as "high as the traffic
would bear." There are many people
who would use the same rule in taxing
railroads—forgetting that after all the
public pays the taxes of the railroads.
Again it is also evident that of the
fourteen per cent left after subtracting
tje real estate and railways, that a very
large proportion of this fourteen per
cent is also based on visible and mater
ial classes of personal property. It is
composed of cattle, horses, farm uten
sils and machinery, stocks of store
goods, household goods, bank stocks,
etc. All of these as we said come under
the personal eye of' the assessors and
while we do not need to make the actual
figures we can safely say that probably
at least twelve per cent of the classes of
personal property is visible to the naked
eye of the assessor and consequently as
sessed as equally as his judgement will
allow. This leaves but two per cent of
the total taxation to be derived from
rather uncertain assets.
That is to say, that about ninety
eight per cent of our taxes are based on
visible and tangible property, real and
personal, which is assessed and taxed in
a fairly equal manner..
This reduces the taxation question
mostly to the two per cent and a pos
sible increase in the "invisible" assets
which the assessor cannot see, and the
assessment of which depends largely on
the honesty of the owner. These "in
visibles" are composed of such things as
cash, bonds, mortgages, etc. In such
an agricultural county as this (and typi
cal of the whole state) if every taxpayer
should honestly give in to the assessor
to be listed all such property we think
it would not add very much to the grand
total. At least not to such an amount
as would reduce the burden of taxation
so as to be felt by the average taxpayer.
In the large cities, where millionaires
dwell and do business such money se
curities make a large aggregate, much
of which escapes taxation. But either
here or there, it is evident that it will
always be very difficult to make such
taxation successful because the securi
ties are £o easily hidden. That they
should be taxed is very true, but since
governments ware instituted and the
necessary taxation following their sup
port, tax gathereis have been trying to
uncover this sort of taxable stuff, and
as yet no plan has succeeded.
We shall be glad to learn that the
North Dakota Tax Commission which
has been on the still hunt for this hidden
wealth shall have succeeded where so
many have failed.
Equitably, this hidden stuff should
pay taxes, but as haves en, if it were all
dug up, it would not make very much
difference in the taxes of the ordinary
individual.
Next week, we will talk on some other
phases of the tax question, on the pre
sumption that these talks will be of in
terest about this time of year, as taxes
become due December first.
The supreme court has decided that
no vote on the removal of the state cap
ital from Bismarck to New Rockford can
be taken this year, as the percentage of
signers to the petition under the referen
dum amendmeut doe9 not authorize a
vote to be taken upon the petition of 25
per cent of the voters, as the intent of
the voters, as the intent of the amend
ment was only to place a minimum per
cent of petitioners without saying what
the per cent shall be,leaviug that part to
be supplied by legislation, which has
not been done.
Owing chieflj to the increased cost of
paper, both weekly newspapers at Roch
ester, Minn., will go out of business with
the issues of Sept. 29. The Olmstead
County Demoorat will be consolidated
with the Rochester Daily Bulletin. The
Weekly Post and record will simply be
discontinued.
