road to Columbus and making It
a Hist class highway, which is

order that the heavy trucks and

sured of free passage between
thecantonmentcainp and the base
at Columbus. The ai.tion of the
Luna County road board which
failed to agree at its last meet
ing on any plan for making a
serviceable roadway south to the
border, made it necessary that
some action be taken at once in
order that nothing be placed in
the way of the movement of
troops from the border if it be
comes necessary.
A committee composed ol
Messrs. J. A. Mahoney, J. G.
Cooper, N. A. Bollch, Arthur

Shoots Bear for Mexican
Sergeant Tony and Truck-
driver Jamison shot a Mexican
near the Corralites ranch in
Mexico Monday night. At least,
they thought they had shot one.
Truck Company No. 24 was tak
ing the paymaster and the money
to pay off the troops in Mexico
along witli a good-sized truck
guard. Tony and Jamieson were
on guard some time during the
night when they saw something
coming into their camp. They
ordered it to halt, but the sup-
xsed Mexican did not halt, so
t tey opened tire. This awoke
all the men in camp, who
thought sure the pay truck was
being held up. The tiring had
ceased, for Tony had seen their
man fall. When the company all
got out to investigate the dead
Mexican was found to be a
black bear weiging 105 pounds.
Truck Company No. 14 had fresh
bear meat for breakfast Tues
