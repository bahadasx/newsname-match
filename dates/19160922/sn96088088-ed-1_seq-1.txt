te Prune Picking.
The Dallas public and high schools
will open tlhe 1916-17 term of school
next Monday. Following the usual
custom at the opening of school, the
first day will be spent in the assign
ment of pupils to the correct grades
and riving out the book list. The
regular school work will start in ear
nest on Tuesday morning.
Twenty teachers will comprise the
faculty of the schools this year. In
the grade building Mrs. F. H. Mor
rison and Miss Nola Coad will have
charge of the first grade, Miss Alice
Grant and Mrs. Edith Plank the
second grade, Miss Georgia Ellis and
Mrs. Emma Jost the third grade,
Miss Edna Morrison the fourth
grade, Miss Alta Savage the fifth
erade. Miss Hallie .Hart the sixth
crrade, Mrs. K. N. Wood the seventh
grade and Miss Cora Rossiter the
eichth grade. Two more teachers are
to be supplied to the grades and these
will be placed where there is most
need for flhem. In the high school
Principal H. H. Dunkleberger will
teach mathematics, Miss Gladys Cart
wrisrht will be instructor in English
Miss Grant in science and latin, Miss
Bess C. Owens in history and Ger
man, Miss Fern Parr in domestic sci
ence and art, I. 0. Chenoweth in
manual training and bookkeeping and
Superintendent W. L. Ford will have
charge of the teachers' training de
partment. It is expected that the enrollment
on the opening day will not be as
large as that of last year, due to the
late prune season which will now
some of the children out for a week
or more. With the conclusion of
prune picking, however, they will re
turn to school and during the year it
is expected that the enrollment will
show the usual increase over previous
years as it has done in the pest
The annual teachers' meeting is to
be held tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'
clock when definite assignments of
work are to be made and plans dis
eussed for the year.
The Dallas company of the Oresron
National Guard will arrive home next
Monday afternoon or evening, fol
lowing the muster-out of the Third
Oregon Infantry which has been set
tor 9 :30 o clock Monday morning.
Ihe announcement of the muster-
out was made Tuesday by Captain
Kenneth P. Williams, of the U. S. ar
my, chief mustering officer. It had
been expected for the past week that
the troops would be released before
that time, in fact some of the boys
who were Dallas visitors last Sunday
were firmly of the belief that the mid
dle of the present week would see the
complete release, but on account of
the special physical examinations
which had to be taken there was a de
lay of several days.
The troops will form on the parade
ground at Clackamas at 9:30 a. m,
and following the muster-out the men
will be paid. Absentees from the
regiment have been ordered to report
at camp at that time, except those
detained by illness. Following the
ceremony the old Oregon, as such,
will cease to exist and those who
have not volunteered for service in
the new regiment to be formed under
the new army regulations, will be
free from further military duty. All
of the members of the Dallas com
pany have signed up under the new
law, which provides for six years'
service.
A public meeting of the Patriotic
League has been called for Monday
afternoon at three at the armory to
discuss plans for the reception of the

will convene on Monday, October 2.

to naturalization proceedings, dut
ing which the applications of several
Polk county citizens will be consid
ered for the granting of final certifi
cates of citizenship. Sheriff Orr will
summon the jurors fithin a few days,

larger in numerous cases, than was
estimated a short time ago. Dr. Mark
Hayter expects to turn out 60 tons,
the Chapman orchard will have a like
amount, the Dickinson orchards will
produce 30 tons, Elliott ranch 35
tons, and the H. L. Crider orchard
between 60 and 70 tons. These re
turns from j'ust a few of the orchards
give a good idea of what prunes are
really doing, and with the present
price of 61c, the prune grower is
certainly fflfln clover ' this year.
The Arnlsby packing plant, which
will handle most of the local crop, will
start to pack on Monday, October 2.
The run this year is expected to be
somewhere between 3,000,000 and 4,-1
000,000 pounds. ,.

A deed from the Falls City Lumber
company to the Cobbs-Mitchell inter
ests for the mill and property at Falls
Citv was filed with the county elerk
vesterday. A release for the bonds or
the Falls City Lumber company neia
bv the Michigan Trust company was
also filed. The new corporation which
will operate will be known as the
Falls City Lumber and Logging com
pany. The papers were filed by C. L.
Starr for the new company.
The Cobbs-Mitchell interests are
the owners of 30,000 acres of timber
binds around Dallas and also are own
ers of the Valley ft Siletx and the
Teal Creek railroads.
Mr. Starr said yesterday that re
pairs to the old mill would begin im
mediately and that operations woold
probably be renamed as soo as the
repair were made. "However," said
Mr. Starr, "the 'when' of the re

PRUNE CROP IS GREAT
TURNING OUT EVEN BETTER
THAN WAS EXPECTED.
Fruit is Large and Sweet and Weath
er Has Been Favorable for the
Orchard Men.
This year's Polk county prune crop
is probably the best ever raised in
this section. Not only is the crop
ft high quality, but the yield it
large, in many eases turning out ten
per eent over what was estimated two
weeks ago, and the price is such that
prune raisers will receive very large
returns for their efforts and the in
dustry will be given an impetus local
ly such as it never had before.
The weather has been ideal for the
fruit Following tb rains of the
fore part of the month, nice weather
set in and this has continued np to
the present time. With a continua
tion of this elass of weather for an
other tea days or two weeks at the
outside, every bit of the crop will
bave beea gathered.
Fruit men report that the prune
this year are especially large and
sweet, due to the favorable elimatir
conditions, and the size of the fruit
is responsible for yields wfaieh are
The Independence bridge collapsed
when the false work was removed
Wednesday morning. It is thought
the structure is entirely wrecked. No
one was injured. Several causes have
been given for the accident: a "long
hole" or pocket in the pier, caused
by the failure of the cement to reach
the bottom; poor cement; or improper
mixing; : ' ' ; '
'When seen in Dallas yesterday
County Commissioner tfeckett an
swered the following questions: '
"Has the county any recourse t"
"We tare not sure."
Were the contractors held by a
bond!"
"There was no bond on the bridge.
There was a bond on the fill. We ex
pected to hold back enough on the
fill to insure the bridge."
The records show that Tobin and
Stevens, contractors, have been paid
for the bridge with the exception of
about $715. That much has been held
back. i .
Sheriff' Office Busy.
Not in recent years has the county
sheriff's office been as busy as it is
at the present time. Sheriff Orr is
kept on the road practically from
one week's end to the other serving
papers such as summons, notices, at
tachments, etc., some daya covering
150 miles in his auto. He is averag
ing close to 2000 miles each month
during the harvest season. In the of
fice Deputies Hooker and Richter are
kept busy wit,h the tax rolls, and they
have written as high as a hundred
tax receipts in a' single day. The
taxes become delinquent on October
5th.
Writes About La Man College.
D. M. Metzger, formerly of the Dal
las college, writes to The Observer
from Le Mars, Iowa, where he is an
instructor in the department of Eng
lish, that the opening of that school
showed an increase of 50 per eent in
the enrollment this year over last sea
son. "We have some strong acces
sions to onr student body," contin
ues Mr. Metzger, "and our freshman
class is by many odds the largest in
the history of the school." .
a Basines Improving.
Local merchants report that busi
ness conditions are improving, and
look for a better fall season than has
prevailed bare for several years. The
close of the hop picking and grain
threshing season is responsible foi
some increase in business and when
the prunes are all picked there will
be a still mora Dotieeable activity.
Farmers Fear Salem Bridge.
Spring Valley farmers are hauling
their grain to McCoy instead of to
Salem as in other years. The bad
condition of the' Salem bridge causes .
the farmers to nnload at the bridge
and this, coupled with the better pric
es at McCoy, has persuaded the
ranchers in favor of McCoy. Among
the men who are selling at McCoy are
W. H. Barker, R. H. Scott, Harry
Cooley and F. T. Nash. The road
from Spring Valley to McCoy is in
very good condition.
Charles Leonard Improving.
Charlie Leonard of Monmouth, who
is earing for a broken hip received in
a fall in Monmouth last week, is im
proving. Mr. Leonard is at the Dal
las hospital.

That's what, the Salem Cherrians are,
a cheery bunch of good fellows who
know how to be neighborly. ''-
It was Cherrians' day at the coun
ty fair,Wednesday afternoon and the
navy white uniforms of the men of
the, capital city's marching organisa
tion were conspicuous. The crack
Cherrian band played. : i
The Cherrian special arrived in
Dallas about 1:15. Though automo
biles were waiting to carry the men
and women in the party to the fair
grounds the Cherrians said they
would rather walk. After the inform
mal greetings extended at the station
by President Patterson of the fair
and Mayor Kirkpatrick of the city
a parade was formed. 1
At the head was "Doc" Epley, the
Salem dentist, who came, saw, and
took the heavyweight honors away
from our own "Doc" Starbuck.
"Doc" Epley is drum major of the
Cjherrian band. - Then the band, the
marching Cherrians, President Pat
terson and W. V. Fuller in the Ful
ler automobile, : Mrs. Fred Hblinan
driving her beautifully decorated nuv
chine with tiny Miss Willa Ames, as
a guest, and the decorated R. W.
Ballantyne car followed. After the
Ballantyne car was the automobile of
Mr. and Mrs. Lee Fenton with a
crowd of children. On the machine's
sides were banners with the following
Product." Then came a string of
inscription, "Polk County's Best
automobiles carrying the women of
the Cherrian party. The route of th
parade was north on Church to Court,
east on Court to Main, north on Main
to Mill a.nd return to Court, west on
Main via""ffiiyter""ari J " Washington
streets and Fairview avenue to the
fair grounds. At the grounds the
Cherrians drilled and their band
played. -'-.:"
President Patterson introduced
Mayor Kirkpatrick, who extended a
welcome to the visitors. King Bing
Frank G. Deckebach of the1 Cherrians
responded on behalf of the organiza
tion. "We come to extend the greet
ing of good cheer" said King Bihg
"and the hand of fellowship. Wie
want you to come to see us next
week at the state fair, which is for
all the people of the state. We come,
not alone as the representatives of
the city of Salem, but as represents-.
tives of the capital of the state. The ,
state has been very good to us and
we are trying to return, in a little
way, the favors bestowed upon us. .
Next week we will try to return this
very pleasant greeting you have ex
tended to us."
Mayor H. 0. White of Salem eon-,
gratulated tihe people of Polk for the
size and quality of the fair. Ex-Mayor
George F. Rogers was called upon
for a speech but could not be found.
After the speaking Mrs. Hallie Par
rish Hinges of Salem sang two songs.
A group of the Cherrians livened
matters up by mounting "Painless"
Parker's exhibit automobile and
shouting for "Doc" Epley. Inciden
tal automobile trips into the country
were given the visitors by Dallas au
tomobile owners,
add Cherrians Visit.
There are a number of Polk county
children who have occasion not to
forget the Salem Cherrians' visit.
Tbey are the kiddies who rode the
merry-go-round Wednesday afternoon
at the capital city visitors' expense.
The Cherrians chartered the merry-go-round
for two rides and then gath
ered the children together.
