of them.
They were kept at the city hall and

Chicago Women Are Going
To Organize Against
Advances
(By Associated Press)
CHICAGO, Sept. 22.?Housewives ot
Chicago were called on today to attend
a mass meeting at which an organization
will be perfected to fight
increases in the prices of food stuff.
The announcement that bread is to
be advanced from five to six cents a
loaf resulted in the call for the meeting.
Miss Florence King, president of the
Woman's Association of Commerce under
whose auspices the meeting is to
be held, urged that housewives boycott
dealers or refuse to purchase supplies
which have been advanced in
price.
"Men are interested in buying and
selling for a profit. It is therefore
folly to expect them to take any action."
the call reads. "Women must
put a stop to unwarranted increase!,
and we alone can stop them."

District
j
i
The first train of coal over the
Western Maryland railroad was taken
out ot that section early this morning
by engine 627, the locomotive which
brought 27 empty coal cars here for
loading. The number of cars loaded
was not sufficient to take care of the
engine rating so the crew picked up
some Baltimore and Ohio loading and
brought It to Fairmont yard for the
B. & O. train men who at all times
welcome assistance In getting cars
over the Monongahela River district
of the Monongah division. After, its
arrival here the train was reduced to
Its regular Western Maryland freight
and left the yards with 14 loads of
coal at 10 o'clock this morning.
Another train of coal cars will arrive
In the city this evening for Chiefton
and will be given a pilot to the
mines where It will pick up loads and
place empties. President Carl Grey
left last evening accompanied by Superintendent

IN MAM COUNTY
State Health Department
Says Disease Can Be
Prevented
Many persons died of preventable
causes In Marion county during 19in
according to the State Department of
Health. Three are 666 total deaths
recorded for thp year. Of those 192
babies lyMer^atffe jfear of age died
from causes which were largely preventable.
Tuberculosis added 46 and typhoid
added 26 deaths to tbp list. Four
deaths from diphtheria could have
been avoided If the antitoxin had been
given early in sufficient dose. Cancer
caused the death of 16 persons most
of whom could have been saved by an
operation if early diagnoses had been
made and surgical attention sought
Whooping cough killed one child
which might have been saved if the
parents would consider whooping
cough a serious disease to be avoided.
The typhoid deaths occurred in nine
different towns, Fairmont being credited
with ten deaths. These cases
probably originated outside and were
brought to Fairmont for treatment,
but with the present system of recording
deaths. Fairmont must be recorded
as the place of death. This unjustly
raises Fairmont's typhoid death
rate and proves the need in an early
change in bandling the vital statistics
of the state.
The standard death certificates, as
used by all other states but two. say
the state officials, should be adopted
here, and the original certificates.be
filed monthly with the State Health
Department. The cases of typhoid
can then be credited where they belong.
"These cases of typhoid could have
been prevented by immunization with
typhoid vaccine." Persons traveling
or living in section having .much typhoid
fever should be vaccinated," according
to the State Department. This
Includes Marlon county'.. ,
City Hall Notes
There Is a possibility that children
failing to present a health certificate
will be barred from school Monday
next when the city schools open. Every
doctor in the city has been supplied
with blank certificates and are
finding very few. cases where the children
are not up to the normal stage
of good health.
Gulgielmo Garcia from Spain, who
has been-employed at digging ditches
In the city resigned from the employ
of the street department and has gone
t work In the mines. He Is on the
pay rool as Guy Glass and when time
came fro Identification so that he
could get his pay check presented a
bank book In which he had to his
credit $250. He said he was going to
wnrlr In Iha mfnna trhnra ha aan

The city Is getting ready to clean
out the old council chamber room
which in the past few months has become
an abandoned and dreary hall.
When cleaned up and fixed ready for
occupancy again there Is a likelihood
that moat of the public meetings to be
held here will take place In the Council
chamber room.
When the -city commissioners yesterday
visited' the workings at Pleasant
Valley road and State street they
saw a familiar sight. It' was the
building which was moved from tho

New Bridge Plans

bridges in the county which were car- i

the county court were discussed at a

taken.
The Parker run bridge on which the

ic^ was organized last night at an en- hi
thusiastic meeting called'by AnU-Tu- hi
berculosis League of tbis city in the ty
Y. M. C. A. auditorium. The purpose sc
of the meeting as announced, was a cl
get together meeting for the purpose hi
of broadening the scope of the League ci
and to form plans for cooperation with N
the American Red Cross socioty. m
The Antl Tuberculosis League p
which has been one of the factors 0I
for good in thsi community was organ- te
ized on March 2, 1909, and during the Q,
seven years of its existence has been
untiring its zeal and efforts to care
tor patients suffering with tuberculobIs
and to prevent by sanitary teachings
the spread of the white plague, m
The roganlzation while diligent in the I
extreme has been hampered by lack li
of funds and those closer in touch V
with the work realized that a larger
membership would tend toward more
effective work and the meeting held
last night was for the purpose of
organizing for a more effective campaign
against contagious and Infectious
diseases.
Mrs. C. O. Henry presided at the J)
meeting and introduced Dr. J. H.
Broomfleld who gave a splendid talk
In which h'e recalled the many noble
mings accomplished by the League
and predicted more and broader accomplishments
tor the new organization.
Miss Elizabeth Voak the Red
Cross Nurse affiliated with the work
Df the league gave a report in which
she stated that several nurses could P'
be used with good effect in caring tor at
the sick in this community. c,
During the lite ot the league Mrs. P
