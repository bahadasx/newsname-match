to upward of a hundred, to Include
all the lovers of the sport of rifle
shooting and others at the same time
who may wish to eolist in practical >
preparedness. Hart, Stroud and Mi

committee.
There are at present over »0 clubs
in the United States with more or
ganizing at the rate of one a day.
January starting with 3«. These
clubs are organized under the super
vision of the National Rifle associa
tion and the branch of the war de
partment known as the National
Board of the Promotion of Rifle
Practice lu the United States.
The government furnishes a rille,
the Btandard military piece, to each
five men of the club, and 120 rounds
of ammuntlon per man per year.
Each man nmy qualify as marksman,
sharpshooter, or expert rifleman, the
same as a guardsman. However,
there is absolutely no obligation con
nected with a membership in the
club.
The member is not even obliged to
shoot. To any member qnalifylng,
the association issues a bronze lapel
button. To any making sharpshooter
or tietter, the government will sell
the rifles, should the member wish
to purchase. The Krag(new) sells
for about S5, the Krag carbine 13 ard
! the Springfield, now in use by the
j army and guard, for about 912.50. '
! All ammunition and supply houses
I grant club meiutisrs a dix omit on

; Once each year each state holds
j telegraphic matches, for which the
[government awards trophies. There
are slso awards for Individual scores!
in the club, both fot range and gal
lery shooting. There is also the nu
tional match, this year beginning
Otcober 20, at state Camp, Florida.
Idaho at present has seven or eicht
clubs.
The sole object of these clubs is to
ac< > u * ,nt che civilian wltn lhe ral,l '

value of such a club to a oity should
j not ^ overlooked. To give an Idea
