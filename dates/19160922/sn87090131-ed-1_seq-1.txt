CORNGR OF CMAMBOR~~ `ANTAZMIC Root
-OME time ago it was announced (Ch
that the Chateau de C(hambord II
had been sequestered by the rib
French government, which was boi
a polite way of saying that it had est
been taken over by the ruling powers, kit
and would he devoted to xwhatever use tic
it was seen fit to make of it. he
This announcement was of interest as
to thousands of Am(-lcan tcurists who lo
may have been privileged to visit the wi
celebrated castle in their ramblings to fit
the south of Paris, in the department ex
of Loir-et-Cher-for the chateau is mt
situated about twelve miles to the east me
of Blois, the principal city of that de- th
partment, in the midst of a park 21 le1
miles in circumference. m
The sequest *ring of the Chateau de
Chambord marked the transition of fr
one of the most interesting structures ! til
that date back to the renaissance in X
France. "Francis' Folly" someone has )
dubbed the great rambling pile of ma-'- in
sonry whose spires reach heavenward, it
and to whose lines architects and ar- d,
tlsts have in vain tried to attribute L
some semblance of grmtce. It
But whatever architectural defects
the chateau may present, there is no
doubt that it is one of the most notable
edifices of its kind in Europe, marking VI
as it does the transition between the P
fortified castle and the Italian palace, s'
somebody has said with all the defects k
of both generously incorporated.
The Chateau de Chambord was built fl
at a time when money was of little ac- o
count to the ruling c(lasses if there was "
a whim to be gratified. It dates back.
to the fourteenth century. Under the o
counts of Blois it was a feudal manor a
house. The Orleans princes converted T'
it into a sort (i hunting lodge, and it s
was such when Francis I decided to I
make of it the largest and most mag- I
nificent chateau in France.
Francis I did not believe in doing b
things by halves. It was a habit of
his to wander about from chateau to I
chateau, of which he had a consider- I
able string, with 1,800 people forming t
his retinue, with furniture and bag- a
gage in prolportion. It must have been t
a bit annoying to the restless and 1
high-spirited king to have members of a
his personal staff getting close enough f
so that they could recognize each other. 1
As near as can be figured out, this was 1
the excuse for Chambord, for in its
vast halls 1.800 people would rattle I
around like shot in a gourd, and all the s
paralphernalla that accompanied these
frequent hikes could be deposited in
one room and leave plenty of space
for a A)dlly portion of the attendants
to devote themselves to terpsichorean
pastimes.
Beginning of Chambord.
The foundations of Chambord were
laid in 1526. but it was not until some
time later that it began to stand forth
in its true proportions. When Francis
I died at Itambouillet in 1547 Cham
bord was still incomplete, although 800
jmen had labored on it for 12 years.
But enough of the more than 400 rooms
i had been finished, so that the royal
entourage cou!d be housed here in com
fort, while the presence of such a
number of persons, and the attendant
gayety, alone made the place endur
able as a human habitation.
Henry II continued the work on the
I chateau in an indifferent manner.
Charles IX and Louis XIV in turn took
a hand at it, the latter appearing In
the role of chief tinkerer to the in
artistic, and erecting the low screen
at the back which completes the in
Ilosure of the court and adds to the
incongruity of the whole place.
The death of its planner did not
mark the passang of high life frost
(lChambord. When the ci', .cf Francis
II was driven from Amnho:-e by the ter
rible massacre, they repaired to Chanm
bord, where it was sought by the wild
est of revelry to cheer up the young
king. Marie Stuart shoe e with par
ticular brilliance at these orgies, but
her reign in this capacity was as brief
as It was sensational. Others who fol
lowed in her footsteps won disfavor
with Catherine. who didn't propose let
ting any outsider weaken the hold she
exercised over her sons. Charles IX,
maddened by the meddlings of his
mother, went to Chambord in 1567, and
the boar hunt he indulged in as an out
let for his anger held the record for
many years.
Gradually, however, courts c:ame less

times it was in the possessilon of Louis
XIII, Louis XIV and Gaston, Due d'
s Orleans, who puttered around attempt

ta sible chateau, and spent most of his v
le life In exile, where he was spared the ,
he doubtful pleasure of being lionized by p
se royalists. I s
in At his death without direct heirs, in s
ce 1883, he bequeathed the chateau to the; it

Msteres
In the year 1808 Catherine Seldel,
who lived on a farm not far from
IHegendorf, Bavaria, made up her mind
that the advantages of the rural life
were greatly overestimated. She was
tired of milking cows, and churning,
and washing di.hes, and all the rest
of the household chores. Being an
extremely pretty girl, she had the idea l
that her opportunity for a brilliant ca
reer could be found In town, rather
than In the country; so one day she i
packed her carpet hag with her best I
belonging, put on a beautiful dress, 1
and went to Regendorf, full of rosy
drel Ins.
She reached the town all right,
as subsequent investigation showed,
and then she vanished from the

face of the earth. Days and weeks b
went by, and her relatives on the S(
farm. having heard nothing of her, no- Ba
titied the police, and the officers made th
a diligent anl prolonged effort to find di
some trace of her, but in vain. It was tb
the most conplete mystery they ever th
en'omiitour,.l. All they could discover be
was that the girl reached the town in
safely. There was not a shadow of ce
a clui. us to what became of her af- b(
terward-i. The mystery attracted gen- at
cral attention, and expert policemen
of various cities evolved theories a!
which allme to nt!hing when tested. w
(:therine had a younger sister who pl
remaninod on the farm. This sister, hb
(;ertrudet, when the best efforts of the v,
police had failed, also packed her car- It
pit bag and went to Regendorf, saying n
she would learn the truth concerning "
her sister's fate if it took her whole fi
lifetime. For a long time this girl was b
a familiar figure in the town, as she
pursued her strange errand. She ques- R
tioned everybody, she invaded peo- to
pie's houses, she became a nuisance to I
the police and the authorities, and the g
mayor repeatedly pointed out the use- ii
lessness of her course, and urged her t
to go back home. f
But Gertrude was inexorable. One s
day she went into a tailor's shop, and
began asking her interminable ques
tions. The tailor answered her impa
tiently, for his mind was on a fancy
vest he was making, and he didn't
want to be interrupted. IHe was sur
prised and indignant when the girl
snatched the garment out of his hands.
She took it to the light and examined
it closely.
"Where did you get this material?"
she inquired.
"From the man who ordered the
vest made," replied the tailor.
"W'hat is this name?"
"Andrew Bichel, the fortune-teller."
A policeman happened to come along
just then, and Gertrude called him in
to the shop.
"At last," said Gertrude, "we are ap
proaching the truth. This dimity is
I part of a dress Catherine took with her
when she left home, and it was brought
here by Andrew Bichel."
The policeman realized the impor
tance of the clue. Taking the vest
e with him, he escorted Gertrude to
headquarters. Then she accompanied
the policeman and several of his fel
la ows to the home of Andrew Bichel.
t This man had lived in the town a
long time and was generally respected,
n although his calling was not highly re
" garded. lIe appeared to be 'a quiet,
L law-abiding citizen. Be had no bad
n habit~, and had a wife and several
t thildren, with whom he lived in such
u harmony that he was considered a
model husband and parent. There
were many who believed in his skill
as a seer, and they told of numerous
phophecies which had been fulfilled
to the letter.
WVhen the police knocked at his door
he met them with a smiling face. They
explained their errand, which was to
search the premises, and he seemed
amused. The officers searched every
inch of the house, and found several
garments of Catherine Seidel's, togeth
er with a vast array of feminine wear
ing apparel which evidently didn't be
long to his wife. He had a story to
explain the presence of Catherine's
clothing. He said he didn't know who
the girl was. She came to his house
to have her fortune told, and there met
another client, also a stranger. She
asked to leave her bag there a while,
and went away with the stranger, and
that was the last he ever saw of her.
It was true that he appropriated her
goods, but was prepared to pay for
them. He had given up expectation
of the owner ever claiming them.
The story was a little thin, as was
also his explanation of the great quan
tity of women's clothing in the place,
but the police were at a standstill.
There was no evidence whatever that
anything had happened to the girl
there, and they felt that they were
baffled again.
, Just then along came Sergeant
n Schneider with his trained dog. The
d sergeant's dog was the joke of the
e police department. He had used all
a his spare time for a year training it,
and was forever talking stout it. No
t body had any faith in the animal, and
n the officers laughed when they saw
a him coming. The dog was turned
. loose in the house, and it sniffed
r around awhile and then ran baying:
1, to a little woodshed in the rear of the
ht ouse. Then Gertrude noticed that
the fortune-teller had turned pale as
y death, and his brow was wet with
sweat.
t, "Follow the dog!" she cried, and
(1, the officers did s6. They let the dog
io into the shed, and the animal at once
began scratching the dirt up in a clod. I
Schneider got a spade, and dug down,
and soon found human bones. Then
the dog ran to a pile of logs and began
digging again, and the officers removed
that pile in a hurry, and, after using
the spade a few minutes, produced the
body of a woman. This was Cather
ine Seidel, identification being made
certain by the presence of her pinch
beck earrings, which were recognized
at once by Gertrude.
Later the first body was identified
as that of Barbara Reisinger, a girl
who had disappeared mysteriously the
prgeous year. Then the townsmen
began to talk of other girls who had
vanished in recent years without leav
ing a trace behind them, and, although
nothing definite was ever proved, it
was considered a certainty that the
fortune-teller could have told what
became of them.
Bichel's nerve gave way entirely
when he was jailed, and he confessed
to the murder of Catherine Seidel and
Barbara Reisinger. In each case the
girls were passing his house when he
invited them in to have their fortune
told. He placed his magic mirror be
fore them, and then blindfolded them,
saying that when he removed the ban
dage they would see their future in the
mirror. And while they were thus
blindfolded and helpless he stabbed
them in the neck, and, after despoiling
them of their belongings, buried the
bodies.
The public indignation was so great
that lichel had to be strongly guard
ied throughout his trial. Had the peo
ple been able to get their hands on
him they would have saved the exe
cutioner some trouble. The wretched
criminal was sentenced to be broken
e on the wheel and beheaded, but the
first part of the punishment was re
mitted.
Gertrude went back to her milkpans
g and her chickens mourning her mur
dered sister, but finding some comfort
in the reflection that she had unrav
eled a mystery which had puzzled all
a the great detectives of the time.
He Should Worry.
"Mariah," said Enpeck at the break
t fast table, "last night I dreamed that
*O you had eloped with another man."
"And were you worried?" anxiously
1. Inquired Mrs. Enpeck.
"Yes, Mariah, I was," replied her
a husband, "when I woke up this morn
d, ing and found you were still here."
