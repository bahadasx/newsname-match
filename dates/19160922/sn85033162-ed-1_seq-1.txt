to be very good, and especially
on Alsea Bay. ,
Politics are starting up and we
may expect lively times until
after the fall election. Oregon
will, no doubt, go Republican by
30,000 majority. If the Repub
licans are united as they appear
to be now, Hughes will be elect

lican can vote for Wilson with
out endorsing the Democratic
platform and then he would not
l a Republican but a Democrat.
