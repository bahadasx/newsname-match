AUTOMOBILE ROLLS
OVER THE GRADE
Henry Emmett Injured -
Totally Destroyed
Henry Emmett of Little Bear
ridge had a very serious accident
last Sunday while driving his new
►Knight car, which
chased about two weeks ago. He
was driving up the Pine Creek
grade leading on to Bear ridge and
attempted to change gears from in
termediate to low. Instead of j
changing to low he threw the en
gine into neutral and the car be
gan to back down the grade.
Either the emergency brake or foot
brake would have held the car but
Mr. Emmett was not accustomed to
driving and forgot to put on the
brake.
The car ran off the grade and as
it turned over the wind shield
caught on a tree causing the car
to turn around. At this time it
is thought the occupants of the car,
consisting of Mr. Emmett and
seven children, were thrown out.
The car then rolled over a hundred
feet, down an almost perpendicular
embankment, lodging between two
narrow ledges of rock. The gas
oline tank was punctured and im
mediately caught fire entirely con
summing all of the inflammable;
parts of the car, with the exception !
of one of the tires which Mr. L. R. |
Waite, who was nearby when the
accident occurred, managed to save !
and the cushions which were thrown i
out. The car is a total wreck.
Mr. Emmett had his jaw- fractur
ed at the point of the chin and suf
fered a fracture of his right arm, j
also a deep laceration near the
elbow. He was taken to the hos
pital at Lewiston by Dr. Hoyt, and
the broken bones were set and held
in place by means'bf silver plates.
The last reports are to the effect
that he is getting along nicely.
A remarkable fact in connection
with the accident is that none of
the children were hurt. The fact
that they escaped injury is proba
bly due to the wind shield catching
on the tree. This swung the car
around, throwing the occupants
out on the upper side. There was
no insurance on the car and all but
a few parts of it will be left where
it fell.

Ted Roberts has installed a
shingle mill in the Cedar Creek
country, about 15 miles from Kend
rick and two miles from Conner's
sawmill. Mr. Roberts has over
500 acres of timber land, most of
which is cedar and white pine. It
is said the cedar is of very good
quality and there is enough of it to
run tbe ^° r P robab ly six years.
The mill is a new, upright machine

Kendrick Fair Next Week
Livestock Parade And Stock Judging Will Be a Big
Feature of The Fair
No industry in the Potlatch coun
try offers the possibilities that the
live stock industry does. The Kend
rick Fair committee realizes this,
and for that reason they are ex
tremely anxious to have the best
exhibit of live stock ever assembled
in Kendrick. A number of breed
ers have signified their intention of
bringing in their stock and the
committee invites every one who
has something good to bring it in.
The value of the premium is a very
small consideration compared with
the value of the exhibit to the com
munity, as well as to the exhibitor.
Nothing tends to create more in
terest than friendly competition be
tween producers, besides, seeing a
good exhibit of live stock, creates
a desire in the man who breeds
poor stock, to have something
better. To those who are raising
breeding stock for sale the Kend
rick Fair offers an excellent oppor
tunity to advertise the same in the
best possible manner.
JUDGING
The judging of all animals will
be in charge of an expert and the
live stock committee will endeavor
to have the judge give a reason for
his decision.
POULTRY SHOW
The poultry department of the
Kendrick Fair has increased in both
the amount and quality of the ex
hil its each year and this year prom
ises to excel by far any previous ex
hibit. When we realize that the
poultry products of the United
States amount to more in dollars
and cents than the wheat crop, it
is easy to find the reason for this
department's growth. If you are
raising pure breed poultry bring
in an exhibit and you will find that
it will be a good investment in
time.

The Elder faction supported J. T.

proxies of committeemen from
nine counties. These were thrown
out when the anti-Elder men

Kendrick
the size of Kendrick have success
fully carried out the plans adopted
by some of the trade journals and
have derived great benefit fnom the
small amount of labor and cost that
are required to carry on such a
campaign.
I Kendrick will start in a small
way this fall and if the plans are
successfully carried out, it is the
j n ^ en ^j on make this national
movement a permanent institution
here. This is September and rather
late to get the matter properly
started but if the
others interested
merchants
will talk
and
the
matter up for the next few days,
there is no good reason why it can
not be carried out successfully.
HEAVY LOSSES
Great Menace To The W heat
Growers
j
Smut in the wheat has cost the
farmers of central Idaho and east
ern Washington at least five per
cent in price and from 10 to 15 per
cent in yield, is the estimate made
by E. W. Eaves, of the Vollmer
Clearwater company. Mr. Eaves
regards smut as the greatest men
ace to wheat growing in the entire
inland empire region and stated
that the farmers must resort to
practical methods to protect their
crops.
Mr. Eaves stated that all locali
ties that can grow corn, beans and
peas can easily escape the smut by
planting these crops on the summer
fallow land and following the next
spring with Marquis wheat. Spring
sown Marquis is immune from
smut and the experience of the
farmers this season is that Marquis
returns a better yield and demands
a higher market price than any
other variety.
In the higher sections where corn,
beans and peas cannot be grown,
Mr. Eaves recommends the seeding
of the Karkhoff turkey wheat. He
stated this variety will return a
yield of five to ten bushels more
than the ordinary turkey and will
demand as high a price in the mar
kets.
Perhaps no person in the west in
terested in grain has given more at
tention to grain growing and the
problems the farmers must encount
er than Mr. Eaves. His study has
extended to every wheat-growing
country and it has been his prac
tice to follow closely all investiga
tions and experiments made regard
ing grain pests. He has made his
recommendations for eliminating
smut in the. wheat of the north
Idaho and eastern Washington reg
ion after careful investigations and
feels all sections can eliminate the
smut, that is reported more damag
ing to crops this season than ever
before.—Tribune.
