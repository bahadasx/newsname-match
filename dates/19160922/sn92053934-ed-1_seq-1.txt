Galveston. Texas, Sept. 22. Two
British subjects were taken from
their homo and shot, and 38 of a
party of Carranzista soldiers were
killed in a raid Sept. ltf on an
Abulia oil ramp near Tuxpam by
bandits calling themselves Villis
tas, according to a report brought
here today by the steamer Topila
from Tampico.
The Carranzistas put up a hard
fight, it was said, but were outnum
bered and overpowered. Two of the
Carranza officers took refuge in the
house of the Englishmen. They were
discovered and put to death and the
Englishmen were killed for having
given them shelter, the report adds.
Doubts Chihuahua Report.
Washington, Sept. 22. Secretary
Baker let it be known today that the
war department was not disposed to
accept as accurate the report of Vil
la's raid on Chihuahua City last Sat
urday transmitted by Brigadier Gen
eral Bell yesterday on the strength of
information that had reached him in
El Paso.
"We have no military information
as to renewed Villista activities," Mr.
Baker said, indicating that if was asj
sumed that General Bell's account was
based upon rumors and reports cur
rent in border towns, and not facts
obtained through army channels in
.Mexico. He declined to discuss in
any way what effect the reappearance
of Villa, if it were confirmed, might
have on the movements of American
troops in Mexico.
So far as is known the war depart
ment has made no effort to learn from
General Bell the sources of his infor
mation. General Funston is expect
ed to transmit promptly without addi
tional instructions any authentic news
of the activities of the bandits upon
which any change in plan involving
General Pershing's expedition might
be founded.
"Tissue of Lies," Says Trevino.
Chihuahua City-, Mex., Sept. 22.
Commenting on the reports in Ameri
can newspapers attributed to General
George Bell. Jr., at. El Paso of the
Villa raid upon this city last Satur
day, General Jacinto Trevino, com
manding the Carranza army of the
north, today issued a statement to the
Assoc dated Press in which he described
it as "a tissue of lies and falsehoods."
"I am at a loss to know where Gen
eral Bell obtained such bad informa
tion." said General Trevino. "The Vil
listas carried absolutely nothing away
with them except some of the prison
ers from the penitentiary, many of
whom have i ince returned here. They
captured neither ammunition, cannon,
nor anything else.
"Our artillery drove the Villistas out
of the palaces, which they had taken,
and pursued them in their hasty re
treat with shell, leaving them no time
to carry anything away as they left
galloping in Fmail groups through the
narrow streets of the town."
General Trevino asserted that every
unit, of his force was coordinated, and
all agreed that Villa's band did not
number more than 600 ; that there were
no defections from the garrison and
that all of the automobiles in the city
are acc ounted for. none being carried
away by the outlaws.
Government artillery Are was only
ceased, he said, when the bandits had
been repulsed and there seemed danger
of hitting the pursuing forces under
Generals Ramos and Merriero.
El Paso. Tex.. Sept. 22. Brigadier
General George Bell, Jr., commanding
the El Paso military district, said to
day that his Information concerning
Villa's Hidalgo day attack upon Chi
huahua City was obtained from "sev
eral most reliable sources."
General Bell refused to comment on
General Trevino's statement character
izing General Bell's report as false.
New York, Sept. 22. In a tele
gram today to Juan T. Burns, Mexi
can consul general In New York, Gen
eral Trevino, after reiterating his
statements that his forces defeated the
Villa invaders at Chihuahua City,
pays :
"This foolish shedding of blood was
with the intention of creating difficul
ties for the conferees of the commis
sion at New L,ti:idon at the machina
tions of American and Mexican polit
ical interests. They themselves are
now satisfied that they have failed."
F'unston Believes Story.

information was gained from reliable
persons who had como to El Paso di
rectly from Chihuahua Cily immediate
ly ifter the battle.
"General Bell's report was made up
from interviews had by officers of the
army intelligence in the department
with persons who fle.l from Chihuahua
Citv and was not. based on border ru
mors, I understand." said General
Funston. "Of course the army had no
representatives In Chihuahua and
could not get a first hand report."
A report from General Pershing to
day confirmed the initial success of
the Villistas in their Chihuahua City
attack but indicated they later were
driven out by General Trevino's artil
lery fire. There are now about 50,0'jO

RESERVE BANK IS
FACTOROFSAFETY
Seen as Aid to American Business
.Men When Competition is Felt
After European War Fnds.
New York, Sept. 22. American bus
iness men, aided by the federal re
serve bank system, will be able suc
cessfully to withstand the shock of
European competition after the war,
in the opinion of Charles Hamlin, gov
ernor of the federal reserve board.
His views were expressed at the an
nual dinner of the Institute of Ac
countants last night. He said in part:
"I estimate that the wealth of the
Cnited States has increased during the
last two years by $40,000,000,000.
Bank deposits have increased between
$11,000,000,000 and $7,000,000,000 and
the stock of gold has increased more
than $700,000,000. Since the first of
the year the importations of gold have
amounted to $400,000,000.
"No nation in the world has ever en
joyed the prosperity that this country
now enjoys."
Mr. Hamlin said he felt that this
time was one In which American bus
iness men ought to be conservative In
order to prepare for the inevitable re
act ion.
Commending the federal reserve sys
tem, he said that in the future no bus
iness man who deserves credit will
fail to get it. "Never again will this
country see a collapse of credit such
as we have often seen in the past," he
dec dared. "Never again will there be
a currency famine such as we exper
ienced in 1907. I am convinced that
the great prosperity of today is only
a forerunner of the greater prosperity
of the future."
Cincinnati. Ohio. Sept. 22. Paul M.
Warvburg of Washington, vice governor
of the federal reserve board, was the
principal speaker on the program for
