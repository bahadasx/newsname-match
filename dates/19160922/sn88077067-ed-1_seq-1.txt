MONUMENT TO CAMPAIGN LIES
TUTS is the picture of the eleven-story Wyandotte building in
Columbus purchased' by the state of Ohio, approved by Gov
ernor Willis. It is to house the offices outside the state house.
In the circulation of '"The Little Red Book" nnd in speeches
Governor Willis promised to eliminate these offices or restore them
to the state house.
He charged that there was a treasury deficit of $4,800,000. lie
signed a receipt acknowledging the cash balance of $11,000,000 the
day he became governor.
The Wyandotte building is bought with the interest on state
money in the treasury. The Taw signed by Governor Willis author
izes the purchase of additional ground, and the erection of another
building, all with the interest on money owned by tin state and
E laced in banks on interest on the Democratic plan. Since Willis
Beam governor the cash balance has been decreased by several
millions, banks are now beinig called upon for the deposits placed
xwith them becnuse Governor Willis has spent more money than
he has received, and still there exists a healthy surplus.
So it seems appropriate that the above pictured building be
known in Ohio as a monument to two of the biggest campaign
falsehoods ever told in the state.

DRIVERS
Of Autos Who Fall to Dim Lights
on Streets or Roads Should
Be Given Limit.
Automobile drivers should for the
safety of others as well as themselves
be not only willing but anxious to dim
the lights on their machines while
passng other machines or vehicles at
night. If this precaution was taken
and care exercised in passing mach
ines and other vehicles along the
highway there would be less number
of accidents to report and automobile
traveling at night would be consider
ed much safer than at present.
Section 3, Article 8 of the Ohio
state traffic rules and regulations re
quires the dimning of lights accord
ing to the following:
"Bright lights on any vehicle or
street car operated withing the limits
of the right of way of any road shall
be dlmned or controlled while ap
proaching and passing another vehic
le so as to protect from the direct
glare, the eyes of a driver 200 feet
ahead and whose eyes are five feet
above the road surface.
Penalty for violation of traffic laws
is here quoted from section 13421-17
General Code: "Whoever enters upon,
or travels over any portion of the
highways, within the state, in viola
tion of the traffic rules and regula
tions duly presciibed by law, or the
state highway commissioner, or the
county highway superintendent of the
county, shall be fined not more than
one hundred dollars, nor less than
five dollars, and in addition thereto,
such person shall be liable for all
damage done to such highway.

VINT BECKMAN
Tells Easterners Ohio Is Solid for
Wilson and Willis Is In for
Drubbing by Cox.
The New York correspondent of
the Cincinnati Sunday Enquirer has
the following to say concerning At
torney V. H. Beckman, a former Cell
na boy ,now a well known lawyer and
politician of Cincinnati ,who visited
here with his mother and brother and
sisters, East Livingston, this week,
while enroute home fiom the East:
Vincent H. Beckman .President of
the Duckworth Democratic Club of
Cincinnati, who was In New York this
week in consultation with party lead-
era ,can only see victory for Wilson
and Marshall in Ohio and other Mid
del States next November. He partic
ularly Is confident as regards a Dem
ocratic victory in the Buckeye state.
Mr. Beckman came East for a short
rest .going to Atlantic City where he
spent an enjoyable week. He left
here with a party of friends of .Bos
ton, going by automobile through the
Berkshire Hills.
"Naturally the Republicans admit
that Ohio is doubtful," declared Mr.
Beckman, just before stepping into
his car at the Waldorf-Astoria, "and
they have reason to," he continued,
with a chuckle.
"Why, I want to tell you that out
our way we are solid ror President
Wilson that is not from a party
standpoint, but the masses of the peo
ple who are wisely indifferent to the
machine politics of the G. O. P. The
baskbone of that old machine in Ohio
is broken once and all time to come."
Continuing in his praise of the Wil
son administration Mr Beckman said:
"The Middle West appreciates pro
bably more than any other section of
the country the value of the Federal
Reserve act. The (hild labor law.
just recently enacted .also is favored
strongly in our section .and It is rea
dy to creuit both to Wilson."
"Who will be the next Governor or
Ohio?" Mr. Beckman was asked.
"Cox will be elected because the
people better understand and appre
ciate the value of the laws enacted
under his administration" answered
Mr. Beckman.
"Governor Willis is very unpopu
lar. He denounced the Warner tax
law .but the law enacted by the Re
publican Legislature to replace the
Warner bill has not only given no re
lief, but in many instances has been
far more harsh."

RELICS OF CIVIL WAR TIMES
Veteran James Norman, of East
Warren street who dropped Into this
office to pay hi sannual subscription
to The Democrat a few days since ex
hibited several old tintypes of rela
tives taken during the civil war per
iod, all in splendid state of preserva
tion. They were in cases, so much
in style then. To a great many
grown people as well as children they
are a curiosity.
There 8888 styles in Shoes this
year. "Big Pete" has got 88 of
them. The reason we don't fix up
the show window is because we do
not want our competitors or store
keepers to know what we have got.
If they knew what we had It would
worry them so they would send off
and get some just like ours. So It
will pay you to come in and look at
our stock before you buy.
