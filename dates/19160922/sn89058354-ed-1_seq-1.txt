thought her sister contestant had
some advantage now feels that
she has every chance to win.
s There are : people who seem
to have the idea that on the last
of the campaign the votes offer
ed will count more for each dol
lar than they will now. Let us
say right here that any contest
ant who allows anyone to make
them believe' that such is the
case is taking the wrong course.
We have frequently announced
that the largest votes will be
offered on the beginning of the
campaign, and any special votes
offered duri ng the remainder of
the campaign will be much less
than the present offer or any
previous offer.
It is the purpose of the cam
paign manager to conduct the
campaign in an absolutely fair
and impartial way, and any
announcement or. statement
made by him can be relied upon
as absolutely correct, and con
testants should not allow out
siders to influence them in any
way, for by so doing may be the
cause of some one losing the
piano when otherwise they would
win.
We wish to again call the at
tention of contestants to the ad
vantage they will have during
the fair next week to take both
new and renewal subscriptions,
and every contestant who can
should make arrangements to
spend as much time in town
during that time as possible.
People from all parts of the
county will be here; many of
whom are already subscribers to
this paper and who will want to
pay their subscription, as well as
those who are. not already sub
scribers who will want to take
it. Contestants should also re

between the rails.

about the head and body, one
broken bone in his left wrist, and
painful bruises.
His escape from death is con
sidered nothing short of miracu
lous, as he would have been
killed had he fallen across the
rails instead of between them.
He is at present getting along
nicely and shows signs of , an
early recovery. . .

YTERIAN CHURCH
After more than two years of
planning, hoping, and working,
the efforts of the members of the
Presbyterian Church of this city
are to be rewarded by the con
struction of their new house of
worship.
The contract for this structure
has been let to Otto Hauri, and
actual work was begun last
Monday. It will be built" of
pressed brick,; and will be strict
ly modern in all of its appoint
ments. For the past two years the
members of this congregation
have been worshiping, in the
court house, and it is a source of
satisfaction to them that their
building is under course of con
struction. ,
The church, when completed,
will cost about $14,000, it is
understood.
SKATING RINK OPENS;
SKATING RINK REMAINS
Acting favorably on a petition
signed by a number of citizens,
asking that the skating rink be
closed, the City Council called in
extra session last Monday night,
ordered the rink to cease opera
tions, it is understood.
Tuesday morning the rink was .
opened on schedule time, and
the discordant notes of the gaso
oline piano were wafted on the
breeze to almost all parts of the
city. The skating began, and
upon investigation it was found
that the manager of the rink had
enjoined the City of Paris from
revoking his license. Presuma
bly in anticipation of the action
of the Council, it is said that he
had gone to Clarksville on Mon
day evening and entered injunc
tion proceedings. A fiat restrain
ing the city from closing the
rink was issued by C. W. Tyler
of that city. A copy of the in
junction has not yet been re
ceived by the city.
The proceedings of the city
fathers is merely a rumor, as
nothing definite could be learned
from members of the board.
B. W. POTTS VERY ILL
B. W. Potts, of Hardin, Ky.,.
who is well known throughout
Henry county is dangerously ill
at his home with Bright's dis
ease. Mr. Potts is a prominent
business man of Hardin. He
was reared at Puryear where his
mother and sister now live, and
was for some time general man
ager of the big store operated by
B. W. Potts & Co., at Jones'
Mill. The business was moved
to Hardin about three years ago
and has been operated under the
name of Crawford-Jones-Gatlin
Co., with Mr. PotU in charge,
and under his able management
has prospered to such an extent
that today it is considered one of
the leading concerns in that sec
tion of the country.
The many friends of Mr. Potts
throughout the county will re
gret very much to learn of his
illness and earnestly hope for his
early recovery. ' : ,
