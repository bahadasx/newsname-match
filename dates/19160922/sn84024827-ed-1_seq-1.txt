U. S.-Mexican Commissioners
Are Greatly Disturbed by
Reports of Villa's Growing
Strength.
WITHDRAWAL IS
BELIEVED DELAYED
Mexicans Loud in Protesta

Handle. Situation No Set
' tlement Expected this Week
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW LONDON, Con., Sept. 21.
Peaceful solution of the border
situation is bristling with troubles
for the Mexican-American joint
commissioin, the new attack by.
Villa on Chihuahua City injecting;
serious difficulties into what
would otherwise be a seemingly
simple undertaking. One thing is
certain, there will be no definite
agreement this week.
Settlement Delayed.
The renewed activity of Villa in Chi
huahua positively will delay any agree
ment on some plan of border patrol,
even the Mexican commissioners con
cede this. They hope, however, by to
morrow to have official reports from
their government which will serve as
a basis for argument that the attack
on Chihuahua City is not a true indi
cation of the government's inability
to maintain peace upon the frontier.
Today the Only information upon
the border presented by the Mexicans
was a brief message from Andres Gar
cia, consul at 3 Paso, asserting that
"all is tranquil in Chihuahua."
Withdrawal Discussed.
General conditions in Mexico again
were discussed and the American
members have received more reports
gathered by the state department on
conditions in Mexico. The subject of
withdrawing American troops was
talked over, the Mexicans expressing
their opinion that General Carrauza's
army was capable of coping with the
situation.
Alberto Pani, one of the Mexican
commissioners went to New York to
night on business connected with the
railroaods of Mexico, of which he is
director-general. Without him the oth
er two Mexican commissioners ex
pects to meet the American tomorrow,
but tomorrow night Luis Cabrera, head
of the Mexican commission expects to
go to New York causing a postpone
ment until Monday.

that an official version will be for

Peace Plan Held Up
No officials would predict what ef
fect the incident may have upon the
negotiations at New London. It was
deemed certain, however, that no a
greement could be reached by the
commissioners until it was known pre
cisely how the situation in northern
Mexico has been altered by the Chi
huahua City developments and until
It was made clear what the Carranza
government would do to cope with the
new situation.
Many army officers still believe that
Villa is either dead or his power so
thoroughly broken that he could not
hope to reestablish himself.
It is thought unlikely that General

BERLIN, Sept. 21. The Germans,
Bulgarians and the Turkish troops
under Field Marshal vou Mackensen
have been defeated in the Rumanian
province of Dobrujda, according to
the official announcement from Buch-
arest. It is declared that the invad-.-
ers have retired to the south and are
burning villages in their retreat.
The great battle, which was the cli
max of von Mackensen's swift cam
paign in the Dobrujda district imme- j
diately after the declaration of war
by Rumania, began on September 15
and ended, says Rumanian headquar
ters, on the 20th. With reference to
these operations Berlin merely says
that "fighting in Dobrujda has come
to a standstill."
Rumanians, Russians and Serbians
participated against the invaders,
strong reinforcements having been
hurried to Dobrujda when the opera
tions under the noted German field
marshal threatened to overwhelm a
section of Rumania. A strong line to
the north was hastily fortified and j
powerful forces were thrown out to
oppose the onslaughts of the Central
! Powers.
That the six days battle has been a
sanguinary one is indicated by the
various official statements which told
of the intensity of the fighting that
has continued without cessation.

Reed Now Steals Speeches
and Uses Them as His Own
(By Review Leased Wir
SPRINGFIELD, Ills, Sept. 21. Un
ited States Senator Jas. A. Reed. Jr..
of Missouri, in a speech here today
at a state Democratic rally, replied to
the attacks of Charles E. Hughes on
the Adamson railroad law, declaring
that Hughes bad generally supported
the railroads, and that "if Hughes had
bad his way we would be at this mom
ent engulfed in a catastrophe so Im
mense as to appall the imagination."
Senator Reed charged Mr.
Hughes with declaring. "In sub
stance and effect that union labor
like a highwayman with a pistol,
approached congress and compell
ed it to enact an eight hour law
and that congress, in a cowardly
and truculent manner, surrender
ed the dignity of the nation to the
unlawful and violent demands of
labor,"
Not The First Time
"Naturally Mr. Hughes takes
this view. It is the assertion of
at least some of the railway presi
dents, it is not the first time Mr.
Hughes has taken the side of the
railroads."
Hughes Second In N. Y.
Senator Reed then cited instances
in which he said Hughes, when gov
ernor of New York, had vetoed a two
cent fare bill, a -full crew bill and fire
cent street car fare bill. After read
ing Hughes' statement that the Adam
son law does not provide an S hour
day. Senator Reed charged that the
Republican presidential candidate,
"when he delivered this utterance
might well have been accused of plag
arlsni. for the same speech in almost
Identical language was delivered on
the floor of the United States senate
j by such champions of the people as
Reed Smoot of Utah. Jas. Gallinger of
New Hampshire and Boise Penrose of
Pennsylvania. There is nothing new
in what Mr. Hughes says either in
thought or diction."
, He reviewed the steps leading up
to the passage of the Adamson law
and declared that congress did not
yield to the demands of either union
labor or the railroads.
"Neither the railway presidents nor
the railway employes ever came to
congress or the president with a de
mand of any kind whatsoever.
"What would Mr. Hughes have done
if he had been president in this cri
sis?" asked Senator Reed.
Hughes Sidesteps
"Mr. Hughes does not dare de
nounce the S hour law. Accord
ingly he seeks to avert It by say
ing that congress only provided
that the men should receive a full
day's pay for 8 hours, and that as
a matter of fact the bill passed
was smply a bill to Increase the
pay of the railroad men."
