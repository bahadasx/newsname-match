LONDON, September 22.-r
The British are again striking
hard on the Somme front. Their
latest thrust, delivered last night,
netted them two lines of German
trenches on a line about a mile
long between Flers and Martin
puich, London announced today.
!t is at this point that the British*
liave pushed farthest toward Ba
jaume, which is but little more
tlian three miles distant from
Flers. Last night's advance
straightens out the former bend
in the line from Martinpuich to
Flers, which now runs almost di
rectly east and west.
German trenches were success
fully entered last night south of
Arras, prisoners being taken and
many casualties inflicted. North
of Neuville St. Vaast a mine was
blown up by the British and the
crater occupied.
French Halt Germans.
The French for their part of the
Somme fighting have had another series
of German attacks to cope with. Strong
forrei advanced in waves this morning
against positions recently captured by
the French between Rancourt and Pries
farm. According to Paris the Germans
did not even reach the French lines, be
ing forced back to their trenches with
heavy losses by the fire of the French
guns.
Von Hindenburg in Charge. ?
Ninety thousand men, directed person
ally by Field Marshal von Htnderburg,
took part in Wednesday's attacks on the
new French positions in the region of
Bouchavesnes, on the Somme, accord
ing to La LIberte's special correspond
ent in the field. Many additional artil
lery trains also had been brought up
for the event. _.
The results of the battle were disas
trous for the attacking forces, declares
the correspondent, division after divi
sion being decimated by the Frerichi in
fantry and machine gunfire. The ngnt
in* was extraordinarily fierce in the
center of the region attacked, around
Bouchavesnes and Bo is 1 Abee, and at
Combles. about the Priez farm, as well
as at Kancourt. At Priez farm two
Prussian battalions were nearly <1e
stroyed, adds the correspondent, and a
similar fate was suffered at Rancourt
by three German regiments, which, ad
vancing in four waves, made the last
desperate effort of the day.
The extent of the German losses, says
the dispatch, may be estimated by the
fact that a company of the 11th Ba
varian Division lost 160 men out of 210,
while regiments elsewhere lost 60 per
cent of their effectives.
Transfer Men From East.
The Germans now are transferring
troops from the east to the west, ac
cording to entente advices. A French
official statement issued last night says:
"According to late accounts the great
Oerman counter attack yesterday on
the northern bank of the Somme was
delivered by the 18th Corps, which was
Withdrawn from the Alsne front, and by
the 214th Division, "rfis division was
already entrained for the Russian front
when it received orders half way on its
journey to return to the Somme. It
reached there on the 14th, was put into
the line on the night of the 19th and
was engaged on the morning of the
20th ? In the Bouchavesnes district,
where it suffered enormous losses. More
than 200 prisoners were taken north of
the Somme yesterday."

GREAT FALLS DAM
PROJECTS URGED
Special Board of Army Engi
neers Reports Favorably on
the Langfitt Plan.
OPPOSED TO A SEPARATE '
UNDERTAKING FOR POWER
Dam a Short Distance Above Chain
Bridge Considered the Most
Practical Scheme.
After several months' study, a
special board of engineer officers,
composed of Col. H. C. Newcom
er, Lieut. Col. C. A. F. Flagler
and Lieut. Col. William W.
Harts, today submitted a report
to Secretary Baker substantially
indorsing the project of the Lang
fitt board of 1913, for the estab
lishment of a power plant near
the Great Falls of the Potomac
for the dual purpose of increasing
the water supply of the District
and for the development of power
for electric lights and other pur
poses for the federal and District
governments.
The Langfitt plan contemplated the j
construction of a high dam In the river
about a third of a mile above the Chain
bridge, increasing the water supply by
pumping to Dalecarlia reservoir from
the lake formed by the dam and gener
ating power by utilizing the head cre
ated by the dam, and transmitting and
distributing the power as desired.
Total Cost, $18,021,600.
The estimated cost of the project was
$5,172,600 for the Increase of the water
supply and $9,849,000 for the power de
velopment, a total of $15,021,600.
Although the desirability of the pro
posed plant was acknowledged 'gener
ally in the interests of a more econom
ical administration of federal and mu
nicipal affairs in the District, the great
expenditure of money involved so far
has stood in the way of favorable ac
tion by Congress. Reports from local
army engineers in recent months satis
fied the Authorities of the War Depart
ment that the water supply under the
existing system will be amply sufficient
for several years to come.
Thinking that a plant for supplying
electric power for public uses might
be established at some point near the
Great Falls at much less expense if the
idea of increasing the water supply
were eliminated. Secretary Baker
created the Newcomer board last May.
That board was specially instructed to
Investigate "the practicability of an
improvement of the Potomac river in
the vicinity of Great Falls for power
development alone."
Had to Use Existing Data.
It developed that there were no funds
available to enable the board to make
an entirely independent investigation,
and the members were obliged to re
strict themselves to a study of the data
compiled by the Langfitt board and
other persons who had previously gone
over the field.
The report of the Newcomer board
submitted to Secretary Baker today
says in substance that after a thorough
study of all the data available the con
clusion was reached that ihe Langfitt
project was the most advantageous one
from all standpoints and that a power
plant adeouate for the purposes desired,
without reference to an increased water
supply, could not be constructed for
much less than the estimate made by
the Langfitt board, about $9,850,000.
The report has not been made public,
but it is known that it makes a strong
plea for the preservation of the scenic
beauty of Great Falls proper in the
execution of any plan that may be
adopted for utilizing the water power
of the Potomac in this vicinity.
A copy of the report will be sent to
the District Commissioners, who, it is
said, suggested the idea of a fresh
itudy of the power plant question.

AS TO A GENERAL STRIKE
Labor Union Officials Threaten to
Call Out Employed of AH the
Large Hotels.
NEW YORK, September 22.?
Repeated threats of a great gen
eral strike to help the striking
street car employes caused all
branches of the city government
charged with enforcing the laws
to prepare today for outbreaks of
mob violence.
Mayor Mitchel's notice that he
stood ready to invoke all the civil
and military pflwer at his com
mand to surpress disorder was

establish night service as soon as they
were ready, ? under assurance of ade
quate protection. Thus far 6,700 police
men have been disposed at strategic
points. This police guard includes a
patrol of fifty automobiles and 100
motor cyclists along the most exposed
car routes.
Trade union leaders, - representing
about 700,000 workers, will meet thi3
afternoon to decide whether to issue
a call for a general strike. Home of
the labor leaders said such a strike, if
ordered, would begin Monday or Tues
day. The call, they said, would be
based on the ground that organized
wage earners should not ride ip cars
manned by strikebreakers. ?
May Tie Up Hotels.
According to an announcement by
union officials, the threatened general
strike order will include cooks and
kitchen help, waiters and bell boys.
Virtually every large hotel and restau- j

strike sympathizers lurking on roof
tops throwing bricks and bottles,
which shattered car windows. Several
passengers were injured in sixteen at- j
tacks reported by the police.
Arbitration Plan Dropped.
The plan announced yesterday by M.

personnel is now being recruited from
veterans of the service.
As American volunteers have served
on the Yser, Aisne and Somme, in the

SEEKS AID TO BRING
MR PIANI HERE
Chamber of Commerce Will
Address Letters to Senators
and Representatives.
TO ASK THEIR OPINION
OF D. C.'S ADVANTAGES
Strong Brief May Be Drawn Up at
Future Date Presenting District's
Claims to $11,000,000 Factory.
Inquiries as to what advan
tages they believe Washington
has over other cities, which
should be taken into considera
tion in urging the establishment
of the government-armor plant in
the National Capital, are to be
made of a number of senators and
representatives by the Chamber
of Commerce. This is one of the
first steps which is to be taken
by the committee appointed bv
President P. T. Moran to work
to have the great government fac
tory established within tlie boun
daries of tlie District of Columbia.
Secretary Tom Grant today framed a
letter along this line to be sent to
Senator Tillman of South Carolina,
chairman of the committee on naval
affairs of the Senate. Secretary Grant
also today sent to President Wilson,
the Secretary of the Navy, the Secre
tary of War and members of the House
and Senate naval and military affairs
committees copies of the resolutions
adopted at the meeting of the board of
directors of the Chamber of Commerce
yesterday. These resolutions urge the
location of the armor plant here.
President Moran, who is chairman of
the committee named to work to bring
the plant to Washington, probably will
call a meeting of this committee in the
near future. In the meantime all mem
bers are working along all possible
lines and are expected to have many
ideas to place before the committee
when that body meets.
Brief to Present Claims.
It is quite likely that a strong brief
presenting the District's claims to the
plant will be drawn up at a future date.
It was pointed out today that one of
the District's strongest claims for hav
J ing the armor plant located here is that
it would thereby be directly "under the
| eyes" of the officials of the Navy De
i partment and members of Congress, as
well as other officials of the govern
ment.
Enthusiasts for the plan of bringing
? the plant to this city assert that no
I othor city or state, in their belief, can set
forth claims which in their sum total
will be greater than are those of Wash
ington.
Secretary Daniels of the Navy De
1 partment has said that Washington will
be given every possible consideration
as a location for the eleven-million-dol
lar factory. Because of the great num
ber of sites which have been suggested
and the many claims which have to be
considered, no choice will be announced
probably for at least two months. In
the meantime the committee of the
Chamber of Commerce, it was stated
today, would make every effort and
bring every possible influence to bear
to have the District selected as the
fsite of the plant.
The Truth About
Laughter.
"The prejudice against %
laughter as 'bad farm* aannot

writes H. Addington Bruce.
"Try to become a hearty
laugher If you are not already
one." And he tells why In The

GREAT CROWDS GREET
MR. HUGHES IN WEST
Republican Candidate Is Making a
Whirlwind Dash Into Pub
lic Favor.
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
CHICAGO. September 22.?Candidate
Hughes is making a whirlwind dash
a into public favor In these central
states. They .like the man and they like
his talk, judging from the demonstra
tions of approval that greet him
wherever he appears. Tremendous
crowds have pressed around him in
Indikna and Wisconsin, and have roar
ed approval of his attacks on the eight
hour wage law where the labor vote is
strongest. He has made his boldest
assault upon the legislation of Con
gress and has got thundering re
sponses.
The reception given him in Indiana
was of a character to revive the droop
ing spirits of the republicans and to
warrant them in lifting up their heads
and expecting possibly to have a look
in at the polls.
Mr. Hughes is making a much more
vigorous campaign than he did on his
transcontinental trip, and is satisfying
the demand for "punch" in his speeches.
He is 100 per cent a campaigner now.
He seemed ? to strike his gait up in
Maine, and has been going strong ever
since. The entire republican campaign
is braced up in the middle west, and the
managers are working like nailers.
They were a long time getting up
steam in this section, but they are un
der way now. What they want most
is to save Indiana if possible so as to
have the map all one color from the
Allegheriies to the Mississippi. From
now on Indiana will be contested for
by both parties, down to the humblest
individual voter, and nobody will be
overlooked.
VILLA'S RAID FRUITLESS,
GEN. TREVINO DECLARES
CHIHUAHUA CITY, Mexico, Septem
ber 22.?"1 am at a loss to know where
Gen. Bell obtained such bad informa
tion," said Gen. Trevino, the Carranza
commander here, in discussing today
Brig. Gen. Bell's report of the Villa
raid on Chihuahua last Saturday. "The
Villistas carried absolutely nothing
away with them except some of the
prisoners from the penitentiary, many j
of whom have since returned here, j
They captured neither ammunition,
cannon nor anything else.
"Our artillery drove the Villistas out
of the place which they had taken, and
pursued them in their hasty retreat
with shell, leaving them no time to
carry anything away as they left, gal
loping in small groups through the
narrow streets of the town."
He also asserted that every unit of
his force was co-ordinated; that all
prisoners examined by him agreed that
Villa's band did not number more than
j 600; that there were no defections from
| the garrison, and that all of the auto
I mobiles in the city are accounted for,
i one being carried away by the out
i laws. Government artillery fire ceased
! only, he said, when the bandits had
been repulsed and there seemed danger
of hitting the pursuing forces under
Gens. Kamos and Merriero. ?

as Preliminary Work.
HOUSE FOR COLLECTION
TO COST MILLION DOLLARS
Architect Piatt Working on Plans
for Complete One-Story Edifice.
Pink Granite Face.
Preliminary work on the million-dol
lar ba+Wing which is to house the art
collection of Charles L. Freer of De
troit, Mich., presented to the Smithsonian
Institution, was begun today.
The building is to bo at the southwest
? corner of the section of the Mall occu
pied by the Smithsonian buildings, and
is to be one story in height. It will be
erected by the George* Fuller Con
struction Company.
The contract provides only for the
construction of the basement. Detailed
plans for the story above the ground
have not been completed.
Plans are being made by Charles A.
Piatt, architect, of New York. It is ex
pected they will be completed in about
three weeks, when the contract for the
remainder of the building will be
signed.
Fence Being- Put Up.
The contractors today are construct
ing the fence which is to hide the
building operations, and will begin the
excavation within a day or two. La
borers today were removing the sod
from the plot, so that it can be used
elsewhere about the grounds.
Of pink granite, which is to come
from Connecticut, the building will
harmonize with the dark red of the
Smithsonian building and the pure
white of the Department of Agricul
ture buildings, between which it is to
be located. It is estimated that it will
take about two years to complete the
whole building, when the Freer col
lection will be removed from Detroit,
Mich., where it now is. to this building.
The collection, includes 5,300 works.
Mr. Freer is constantly adding to it.
He has given much time ami spent
much money in collecting it. A student
of art, he has carefully selected all
articles "which appear in it.
Fine Whistler Collection.
The collection of Whistler is declared
to be the finest known. Mr. Freer was
a personal friend of Whistler.
A complete detailed inventory of the
collection has been turned over to the
Smithsonian, so that every piece of
art in the collection can be easily
identified.
Mr, Freer first agreed to bequeath
the collection to the institution and to
give- $500,000 for the erection of the
building. Later he wiped out the orig
inal conditions and determined to give
the collection as soon as a suitable
building could be provided to house it
here. However, realizing that the cost
of building materials and construction
work had increased materially since
1905, when he made his original offer,
he doubled the amount of the original
offer for the building, making it $1,
000,000.

Secretary Baker let it be known
today that the War Department
was not disposed to accept as ac
curate the report of Villa's raid
on Chihuahua City last Saturday
transmitted by Brig. Gen. Bell
yesterday on the strength of in
formation that had reached him
in E! Paso.
"We have no military information
as to renewed Villista activities," Sec
retary Baker said, indicating that it
was assumed that Gen. Bell's account
was based upon rumors arid reports
current in border towns and not facts
obtained through army channels in
Mexico.
Silent as to Effect.
He declined to discuss in any way
what effect the reappearance of Villa,
if it were confirmed, might have on the
movements of American troops in
Mexico.
So far as is known the War Depart
ment has made no effort to learn from
Gen. Bell the sources of his informa
tion. Gen. Funston is expected (o trans
mit promptly without additional in
structions any authentic news of the
activities of the bandits upon which
any change in plan involving Gen.
Pershing's expedition might be founded.
Details of the fiphting at Chihuahua
City last Saturday, when Villa celebrated
the Mexican Independence day by a suc
cessful assault on the Carranza garrison,
are contained in a report to the War De
partment by Brie. Gen. George Bell,
commanding the 101 Paso military dis
trict. It asserts that Villa personally led
the attacking forces: that he took and
held numerous important buildings in the
city for several hours: that he was joined
by a thousand or more men of the Car
ranza garrison, ami retired, promising to
return soon and taking with him a large
quantity of captured arms and ammuni
tion and artillery.
No official would predict what effect
the incident may have on the negotia
tions at New London, which embraced
Gen. Carranza's request that American
troops be withdrawn from Mexico. It
was deemed certain, however, that no
agreement could be reached by the com
missioners until it was known precisely
to what extent the situation in northern
Mexico had been altered by the Chi
huahua City developments and until it
was made clear what the Carranza gov
ernment would do to cope with the new
situation.
Many army officers still believe that
Villa is either dead or his powers so
thoroughly broken that h'e could not hope
to re-establish himself.
Beiterates Claim of Victory.
NEW YORK, September 22.?In a tele
gram today to Juan T. Burns, Mexican
consul general in New York, Gen. Tre
vino, after reiterating his statements that
I his forces defeated the Villa invaders at
| Chihuahua City, says:
: "This foolish shedding of blood was
with the intention of creating difficulties
for the conferees of the commission at
New London at the machinations of
American and Mexican political interests.
They themselves are now satisfied that
they have failed."
