Facing the warning of Mayor Mit
chell that he will call out the militia
in the event of a general strike in
sympathy with the striking street
railway men, labor leaders went in
section to finally consider whether
804,000 organized workers shall be
called out
Characterizing a sympathetic strike
as "grossly violative of the laws,"
Mayor Mitchsll has warned the labor
leaders that he will use all of the
M«ary and eMI Power, vestedin
flBrSmyor" to cope with such a sttn-
•tap..
Backed by Samuel Gompers, labor
leaders stontly maintain that they
will stick by tLeir fight for the right
to organize and claim that tne
struggle is on trade unionism and is
vital to the welfare of all organized
labor.
Gompers in conference with Mayor
Mitcbel gave unmistakable evidence
that he will support the local leaders
in whatever action they decide to
follow.
While the consideration ofva gen
eral Btrike was under way, it was
learned that many labor leaders sug
gest a general boycott on street rail
ways as a more effective weapon.
The plan of these leaders is to order
all union men to stay away from their
work until "proper transportation" is
provided. They maintain that this
wffl be a more peaceful and effective
nethod of settling the difficulties than
a general strike. The state indus
trial commission had entered the
tight and exercising its legal rights
lias issued subpoenaes for the trac
tion officials and strike leaders to ap
pear before it on Monday. The bureau
of mediation of the industrial com
mission will argue the adoption of a
compromise and will use its powers
to the fullest extent to enforce the
compromise which provides for the
immediate calling off of the strike by
labor leaders the re-employment of
strikers by traction lines the reduc
tion of the time of operation of the
Interboro's Individual contracts from
two years to one year.
Meanwhile normal operation -of the
wbway and elevated lines has been
maintained. Intermittent disorders in

Police busy during the night and

disorder was reported. "Partial night

NEW YORK. Sept. 22.—New York's

critical stage today. Before nightfall
there will be a break either one way
or the other.
Leased
miles outside Chihuahua City, accord
ing to an official announcement by
Carranza military authorities at
Juarez, vigorous pursuit of the ban
dit and his followers has not been
taken up since Colonel Ramos aban
doned it. General Trevino is still
conferring with his sub-chiefs before
risking a chase of the outlaws.
Many refugees, native and Ameri
can, who fled from Chihuahua City
before the fighting started Saturday,
are anxious to make affidavit to as
sure the administration at Washing
ton that the raid was engineered by
Villa and was entirely successful.
Accused of planning to Join Villa,
twenty-two natives were taken from
a train during the night outside of
Juarez and brought back to the lat

LOOKING TO AMERICA
Allies In no Mood to Stop War Until
They Have Gained the Anv
bltlon of Crushing
Militarism.
[By Ed. L. Keen, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
LONDON, Sept. 22.—Germany will
set another peace kite flying about
the middle of October, British official
dom, both military and civil, confi
dently expects.
Recent apparently well authenti
cated rumorB have reached London
that Germany, suffering huge losses
because of tne recent allied offensive,
is endeavoring to suggest an armis
tice tnrough Spain or the United
States. It is understood on reliable
authority that King Alfonso so far is
unresponsive and is unlikely to act.
Tne Germans, it is believed here,
hope to tempt President Wilson to
start negotiations at the time when
any attendant success would he likely
to affect favorably his chances ot re
election.
Americans conversant with inside
British sentiment feel certain that
any such move on the part of Wash
ington would not only be foredoomed
to failure, but would arouse the most
bitter resentment of the allies and
also permanently eliminate Washing
ton as a possible mediator.
jsivery indication points not only to
the oneness of purpose of all the
allies to conunue the war until a de
cisive peace 's obtainable, but to the.
fact that the army, the navy and
political leaders are thoroughly united
in the determinaton to assume re
sponsibility if necessary, for the
war's continuation after Germany is
willing to quit. If this does become
necessary, tney will leave to history
to justify the additional carnage in
the interest of the removal of the
menace of militarism.
It is no secret that the Anglo
French are prepared both in numbers
and munitions to continue the present
offensive indefinitely, regardless of
winter weather. Although there was
much nervousness a year ago when
any definite peace proposals from
Germany on a basis merely of aban
donment of the occupied territory
might have been considered sympa
thetically by the military authorities,
in view of the real precariousness ol
tne situation they feel that now
everything favors the allies and that
such an abandonment of occupied
territory would only be to Germany's
advantage, enabling her to shorten
and strengthen her lines.
British soldiers only worry now is
possible over-optimism of civilians
because of their recent successes and

LONG BRANCH, N. J., Sept 22.—
President Wilson will make his first
personal appeal for re-election to
morrow when he speaks from the
veranda of his summer home here
to several hundred 'business men of
Trenton. The gates of Shadow
(Lawn will te thrown open to the pub
lic thirty minutes before the president
appears and several thousand persons
in addition to the Trenton business
men are expected to be on hand to
hear hhu.
Tremendous interest among the
democratic leaders centers in this
speech. It will be the first plunge
of the president into a discussion of
the issues Charles EX Hughes has
been raising in his tour of the west.
The eight hour law, what the ad
ministration holds out to the country
and what it has done toward laying
a foundation for meeting the compa
end of the great war, are ex
pected to feature the first of
the president's "perch campaign"
addresses. More will follow dur
ing the next few weeks. On
Thursday, September 28, he is ex
pected to greet a band of boy scouts
at Shadow Lawn and probably will
speak briefly to them.
The following Saturday he meets
and addresses representatives of the
Young Men's League of Iemocratio
Clubs who will come to Shadow
Lawn. Numerous other meetings
with delegations are on the calendar,
awaiting the president's approval.
The dates for these will depend en
tirely on his western trips to fill
speaking engagements now under
consideration.
~The president, it is stated, will not
accept the invitation of the Trentcn
State Fair association to speak there
Vfednesday, September 27—the day
before Hughes plans to headline the
fair program. The president is said I
to feel that with his summer homel
in New Jersey, he will be able to!
speak and see his fellow Jerseyit6s!
at all times, and it is not necessary
for him to make the special trip to
Trenton. In addition he has hereto-1
fore vetoed all invitations to speak
at state fairs.
The president has prepared with|
exceptional care the speech he is to I
deliver next Monday before the Na
tional Grain Dealers' association at
Baltimore, regarded by democrats as
one of the most important he will
make during the campaign.
The president plans to confer with
Ambassador Walter H. Page at
Shadow Lawn tonight. It is under
stood tne black list question and mail
interference will be discussed.
This afternoon the president will
discuss the Michigan political situa
tion with Assistant Secretary Sweet
of the commerce department, now a
candidate for governor of Michigan.

LONDON, Sept. 22.—British troops
advanced on a mile front south of the
Ancre l^st night, capturing two lines
of German trenches between Flers
and Martinpuich, General Haig re
ported this afternoon.
The gain thrust the British line
forward in the direction of Hill 132
and drove the Germans still further
back toward the Le Sars-Gueude
Court highway, their next strong line
of defense before Bapaume. The
British line is now approximately
directly north of Flers. and Martin
puich, General Halg reported.
South of Arras, British detach
ments entered German trenches and
north of Neuville St. Vaast other de
tachments exploded a mine and oc
cupied the crater.
The German war office almost flat
ly contradicted the British claims of
success, reporting only grenade en
gagements and artillery duels on the
Somme front. Berlin also made no
mention of heavy German attacks
against the French lines north of the
Somme, the repulse of which was of
ficially announced at Pdrls today.
Official admission came from Ber
lin that the Russians have won a vic
tory in the savage fighting going on
around the Smotrec mountain in the
Carpathians. The czar's troops have
occupied the summit of the mountain
and also retain their hold on a part
of the Austro-German trenches near
Kortynica.
On both fronts in the Balkans, the
czar's soldiers are also vigorously on
the offensive. The Russians co
operating with the Rumanians, are
making determined attacks on the
German-Bulgarian lines in Dcbrudja
where Field Marshal 'Mackensen's
army is steadily retreating, according
to Bucharest dispatches. In Mace

the French and Serbs. An official

the Bulgarian war office claimed the
repulse of all allied attacks.

HUGHES CHEERED
BY INDUS
Begins Second Day in Hoosier
State Where Natives Turn
Out in Large
Numbers.
APPRECIATIVE CROWDS
Spoke to Fifty Thousand People Yes
terday and Voice Is Very
Near Breaking
Point.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent]
AiNDEJRSON, Ind., Sept. 20.—» was
a voice-weary Hughes who started c»ut
on his second day in Indiana at 8:00
o'clock his morning. His voice was
dangerously near the breaking point—
but there wasn't a crowd that was
disappointed by failure of the repub
lican nominee to expound his doo
trines as fully as time would permit
"There are very few men who
could have talked above a whisper
today after yesterday's speaking."
said Dr. L. D. Alexander, Jr., the
governor's throat specialist, aboard
the train today, "The governor goes
through such a schedule as today's
and then uses his voice Incessantly
In conferring with the local and state
•leaders."
Even if his vocal chords did play
him strange tricks of sqneakiness at
times, the nominee appeared in splen
did condition today and he eald he
wasn't tired, in the lace of the tre
mendous crowds his appearance is
drawing forth everywhere throughout
the state.
Yesterday it wa# evident that
iHughes spoke to fifty thousand .per
sons. If the audiences he addresses
today at New Castle and "here are a
criterion, he will exceed that number
today. They are cheering crowds,
too, and crowds that seem to under
stand even the veiled meanings with
which the candidate is sometimes
content to outline his thrusts at the
democrats.
vHughes had a slight red sun-burn
on his face today from so many out
of door audiences yesterday. So did
'Mrs. Hughes, who, by the way, is
running a' close ijecond to her hus
band in popularity with .Indiana aud
iences. She has qualified as an ex
pert on congratulating other® on
babies and handshaking.
Emphasizing that he stood for ade
quate protection to the young and
that the present democratic clrild la
bor bill only affected 150 H)0 out of
1,850,000 children the station, he
added:
"If our friends on the other side
pass child labor laws in the states in
which they are absolutely in control,
there would be no child labor in the
nation. Just now they can't pose .be
fore the American people as the
special friends and champions of
children."
One Issue with which the G. O. P.
candidate took particularly well with
his audiences today, was that as to
protection of American rights at home
and abroad and his declaration that
"weakness and vacillation in a policy
of this kind breeds disrespect."
Because of popularity of this line
of argument, the governor used it a
number of times in rear end of the
train speeches. It took the place In
his repertoir of speeches cf that one
devoted to preparedness.
For several days now the candidate
has hardly mentioned preparedness.
He has dwelt for the most part on
Mexico, the tariff, arbitration of in
dustrial disputes, including against
the Adamson bill and Americanism.
Starting from Richmond at 7:35
this morning, the nominee spoke at
New Castle and here and was sched
uled during the day to speak at
Muncie, j-iwood, Tipton, Frankfort,

patches today.

manlans have gained a little ground

Issued at Sofia made no mention of a
Bulgarian retirement, but reported
that the Bulgars are consolidating
their positions in the Dobrudja.
The defeat of Field Marshal Mack-,
ensen in the Dobrudja invasion and
the check administered to the Anstro

of Rumania has caused a renewal of
the demand here for a settlement of

It Is no longer any secret that the

respondents at Athens cabled today
that it was highly improbable that the

The ease wVh which the first Russo
