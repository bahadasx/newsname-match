THE NEW SAXFORD HAS FIRE ,
The fire alarm sounded about mid
night Saturday night and upon In
vestigation It was found that ' the
New Sanford hotel was on fine. The
lire had started In the basement and
smoke had filled nearly every room
In the house before It was discovered.
The origin of the fire is still a mys
tery. The alarm was Immediately
given to the sleeping guests and they
were gotten out of the building as
quickly as possible. We have it from
eye witnesses that there never was
a more orderly procedure in getting
out of a burning building than the
guests of the Sanford displayed that
night. There was no excitement or
confusion on their part, and most of
them brought the biggest share of
their belongings with them. The
fire department was on the scene
promptly and soon had the fire under
control, but not before It had burned
a large hole in the floor leading from
the kitchen into the dining room and
had smoked up the entire building
considerably.' Mr. Sanford estimates
the damage to be at least a thousand
(dollars, which does not include the
stuff carried away by vandals and
coyotes In human form. A good bit
: of bed and table linen and a $90
watch was stolen during the excite
ment, and Mr. Sanford will pay a
handsome reward for evidence that
-will convict the guilty parties. The
liotel has been closed since the fire
pending adjustment of the loss by the
Insurance companies, and will not be
ready for business until the damages
have been repaired. The fire, coming
right at this busy season, will mean
a severe loss for Mr. Sanford in the
-way of patronage besides the loss en
tailed by the fire and thieves. The
New Sanford is one of the good ho
tels of the Southwest and we hope
the Insurance adjustment and re
pairs will be made in a short time
and the hotel be enabled to resume
business.

BOY WINS THE PIG
" Everyone remembers Ray Kennedy
and his pig in the Griffith ft Baugh
man float daring the parade last
week. Ray was dressed like "Par
mer Jones" and carried the pig un
der his arm. After the parade and
during the days of the fair the pig
was displayed In a box in Griffith &
Baughman's window, with the sign
underneath: "I am rooting for the
Sunnyside Addition." Over the box
was the offer to give the pig to any
one guessing its correct weight. The
pig was weighed Friday night and
was won by Chester Brewer, who
guessed 16 pounds, the exact weight.
There were numerous guesses right
around that figure but Chester was
the only one to guess exactly 16,
hence he is one porker ahead.
Next Thursday and Friday will be
the Jewish New Year and Feinberg's
store will remain closed on those two
days. Mr. Feinberg will be in Kan
sas City attending the services inci
dent to that occasion during that
time. .
p Wear
Of all the precious stones brought from their hiding places
in the earth's treasure fields the most prized ones are "Dia
monds." The lustrous glitter of "Diamonds" more than any
thing else in the world delights the eyes of the beholder.
Then wear "Diamonds;" they are the mark of prosperity.
Give "diamonds" for presents; they are the strongest evidence
of esteem and affection.
The "quality is there" in our diamonds. Our prices . are
reasonable.

WVSON
"In the bloodiest crucible of all history
he has kept the stainless banner of the
Republic flying above 100,000,000 of peo
ple in peace and in honor. During these
years of great trial, of difficulties, and
complications crowding upon each other
like waves of an angry sea, with enemies
powerful from without and critics and
traducers from within, with abuse cruel as
it was cowardly, he emerges as majestic
and powerful as a mountain after a storm,
loved by all who believe in justice, and
feared by those who temporize with wrong."

terests of that order and looking af
ter other matters. Mr. Donnelly is
one of the best posted men in the

CAR CAUGHT AFIRE
While draining the water out of
the gasoline in his National-twelve
Tuesday morning. Jonn W. Baugh
man's attention was diverted to
something else for a moment and
some of the gas escaped also and ran
over the engine and other mechan
ism. When he started the engine
business picked up Immediately. John
grabbed some bunting that happened
to be left over from the float used
by his firm in the parade laBt week
and tried to smother out the flames,
but the bunting proved too flimsy and
soon caught Are itself. John made
a bee-line for the house in search of
the hand fire extinguisher and Mrs.
Baughman called the fire depart
ment, but John bad the blaze out be
fore the fire fighters got there. No
damage was suffered by the car but
J. W. says if such a thing ever hap
pens to him out In the country he will
politely walk away from the machine
and let the blankety-blanked thing
burn till it gets through.
ONLY FIVE DRUNKS DURING
. PAIR
Only five drunks were reported by
Chief of Police McMurray during fair
week. These wore promptly taken in
charge by the officers and given time
to consider their misdeeds In the
cooler while the other folks enjoyed
the sights of the fair. Oood order
and cheerful nature seemed to be the
style at all times among the people
who attended the fair this year and
we consider five drunks a mighty
good record with such large crowds
on hand every day.
WE NOW HAVE CIGAR FACTORY
F. K. Reasoner, who came here
few months ago to take charge of the
Liberal band, finds he has time for
other lines of work and has this week
opened a cigar factory in the rear
of the Eagle Grocery building. His
license came the last of the week and
as soon as his stock of tobacco ar
rives he will be ready to', begin busi
ness. He has work benches for three
cigar makers and thinks he will have
work for that many men after he gets
started and Shows the quality of his
brands. His leading brand at present
will be "Reasoner's 46," but he will
put out several different brands in
the future. Mr. Reasoner is getting
well rigged up for business and ought
to have a good patronage coming his
way In a short time. We have had
a sample of his product, and if the
quality of that particular cigar Is
maintained the demand should at all
times exceed the supply. Besides,
when you "buy-lt-made-ln-Llberal"
you are keeping the money at home
and adding that much more to the
town's prosperity.

mother of J. D. Mahoney, died on
Thursday night of last week. Mrs.

the return or Information leading to
recovery of a gold watch taken out ot '
room No. 130, New Sanford Hotel,
during the Are Saturday night. No

valued highly as an heirloom,
O. E. DOBSON, Sheriff.
The little house on wheels that
was shown by C. E. Hancock during
the parade last week was purchased
by Charles Wilson, who will move it
to his lots in the Sunnyside addition
and use it as portion of his residence.
There were several good bids on the
house but Mr. Wilson Anally got It.
The sight of this little mansion cre
ated quite a commotion among the
spectators at the parade and deserved
first prize among the advertising
floats, which it got.
The Massachusetts troops passed
through Liberal yesterday morning
on their return from the border to
Boston. The boys seemed quite glad
to be released from service and get
back to the folks and their Jobs. The
North Carolina troops have been or
dered to the border, and it Is the In
tention of the War Department to
give every National Guard unit In
the United States a chance to spend
some time down there. If this Mexi
can fracas lasts a little longer Uncle
Sam will have a well drilled bunch of
men to call on should real trouble
ever occur.
The ladies of the Presbyterian
church will hold their annual rum
mage sale on October 5, 6 and 7.
