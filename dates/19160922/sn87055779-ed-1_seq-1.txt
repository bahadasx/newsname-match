H'ASIIINCTUN. Sept. onti-
deniial report made to the Pritish
foreign u'AUo by its agents in this!
country including trie emtiasy nere
have seriously interfered with the'
efforts of tl:e state department to
get relief from allifd trade aggres
sive. These reports, the state de
partment learned today, have de
clared that the great mas of Amer
icans generally approved the P.rit
ish mails detentions and blacklist
Kvstems. What reniedi.il action can
be taken to offset these reports is
not. being considered by Sec'y Ionis
ing and his advisers. The situation
is admittedly delicate and informa
tion concerning it was refused today
at the state department.
Confidential reports received here
from Consul (ion. Skinner at London
and Consul (len. Thackara. in Pari
indicate that the general attitude of
the administration regarding all of
its protects to the entente powers
has been misunderstood.
The reports, which now have boon
.implied by the London embassy,
make it plain that the Pritish for
eign oflice has taken the position
that the intluences behind the pro
tests tiled in both the mails and
blncklit cases is part of a German
propaganda in this country
It is known that following the
adoption of the retaliatory legisla
tion in the shipping and revenue
bills, a report was made by Pritish
representatives here to London tUat
this was a "sop to the German senti
ment," and that the provisions ould
not be enforced. It was declare.!
that the great mas of the American
people did not endorse any plan of
retaliation.
The result, according to the in
formation whi. h today i in posses
sion of the -fate department, has
been that the Cuited States protests
are nut considered with sutTicient
setiou-ness hv the Pritish foreign of
lice. It is the intention of the ad
ministration to hive Ambassador
Page visit the Pritish foreign otlice
so soon as he retains to his post in
1ot, don in the nr ir future and make
emphatic representations against the
mi-information being sent in by its

propriating $20,00C,nPQ for that

Experts at the war department
explained today that the principal
means of training a supply within the
Pnited States wo .rid either be
through fixation of atmospheric ni
trogen by an electrical, process or
through a chemical process with
crude ammonia as a base. In the
event the fixation process is determ

must be sought. Should this bo de

the army engineers will recommend
a power site. Among engineering

the tentative plans of the

of new
trade treaties with Furope.m coun
tries wore abandoned today. The
decision of the department, forced
by the determination of the entente
allies to postpone all outside com
mercial ;irran-tiaents until they
can perfect their own trade alliance
will l-?ave America's foreign trade
to drag along under present chaotic

"It is apparent." explained a dip

the present tani;iei commercial sit
