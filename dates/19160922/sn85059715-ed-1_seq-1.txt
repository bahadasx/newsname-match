HUGHES GIVES
AnENTION EO
Republican Candidate Tells of
the Treatment to Smaller
State.
RICHMOND. Iml.. Sept. 22?In
structions nulil to have boon givon by
l'residont Wilson to John Llnd, his
personal representative In Mexico,
during Huorta's lime, was cited In
speeches by Charles E. Hughes nt
Fort Wayne and here In support of
Mr. Hughcs'it denial that tho admin
istration sought to deal with small
slates In tho same spirit as with large
I Mtates.
"I have only recently received tho
authentic Information of the actual
Instructions that wore given with ro
pect to tho government of Mexico,
such as Mexico tlion had." Mr.
Hughes said. "John Llnd was au
thorized by the executive to Btato
thlB proposition to a minister of an
other government, namely: 'Huorla
will be put out If he does not get out.
That Is the preference of the presi
dent that It should be accomplished
hy domestic means, If possible, but
that If It cannot be done by domestic
means, other means for tho purpose
will ho resorted to.'
"There is no basis for lhat In the
recognition of small states," Mr.
Hughes addod. "There Is no basis
for that In the recognition of tho sov
ereignity of our neighbor. There Is
no bails for that In a true and correct
American policy. We departed from
an American policy and left our citi
zens to suffor from tho barbarity
which resuitod when all government
was destroyed and anarchy was su
preme In Mexico. It is a deplorable
recital."
Il?fer* to "Dinner Pull."
In a dozen speeches today, most of
them as rear platform addresses, of
only a few minutes each, the Repub
lican nomlnoe for president outlined
his views on Americanism, protection
of American rights, tho protective
tariff, and tho other party policies.
In one address.at Delphi, Mr. Hughes
referred to "full dinner pails" plo
cards plastered on bill boards at La
fayette by Democrats.
"As I was going through the streets
of Lafayette," Mr. Hughes said "I
saw a campaign placard which 'had
been put up by our friends on the
other side. That placard bore this
statement:
" 'No idle men. Plenty of work.
A full dinner pall.'
"I though 'what an extraordinary
tribute to tho memories of tho Amer
ican voters.' How was It In 1914 and
in the early part of 1916, after the
passage of the Underwood bill? Was
there plenty of work? Were there
then no idle men? Wero there then
full dinner paiiB?
"If we have no idle men today, It
is not due to the policies of our
friends on the other side, but in spite
of their policies and because of the
European war."
Mr. Hughes again declared for the
protection of American rights, in
cluding lives-, property and com
merce.
For Pure American ism.
"We are not here for this nation,
of that nation," he said, "for this
side or that side. So far as I am
concerned, If entrusted with execu
tive responsibility, I shall, to the ut
most of my powers, maintain Ameri
can lights on land and sea through
out the world. With respect to all
nations, I stand here for the right
of Americans, four squares to the
?world."
In most of his addresses Mr.
Hughes again assailed the administra
tion for the enactment of the Adam
son law.
At Lafayette, another stop, Mr.
Hughes referred to the protective
tariff as an American doctrine, rather
than a partisan preachment.
"Henry Clay called the policy of
protection the American doctrine, and
so tt is," Mr. Hughes said. "It ought
not to be a partisan doctrine."
The future of the United States,
Mr. Hughe* told several audiences Is
"full of nothing but agitation and
disturbance unless reason rules our
to We."
"I can see the United States em
broiled In the most serious social
controversies," he said. "I can see
a certain course of action taken that
would lead up perlously close to civ
il war. I tell you. my friends, we've
get to have vision and Justice, open
mlndedness and care, and do all
that we can. not to remove controv
ersy?that Is Impossible?but to see
alive the sense of justloe and have
each remedial efforts put forth that
all will be content, because we find
