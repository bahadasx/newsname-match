Warns Intending Strikers That No Violence Will be Tolerated
BRITISH ARE STRIKING
HARD ON THE SPUME
Capture Two Lines of German
Trenches and Straighten Out
Line for Two Miles
(By Aaaoclslrd l'rr.)
LONDON, Sept. 22. The British
again are striking hard on the Somme
front. The latest thrum last night
netted two lines of German trenches
on a line one mile long between Flers
and Msrtlnpuieh. It was here the
British pushed forward toward Ilau
paume, which Is three miles from
Flers. This advance straightens out
the former bend in the line, which
runs now almost due east and west.
The French Somme front had an
other series of German attacks to
cope with. Strong forces advanced
In waves again! the positions re
cently captured between Kancoiirl
and Priet farm. According to Paris
the Germans did not reach the
French lines and were forced back
into their trenches with heavy losses.
On the Macedonian front the en
tente drive is developing strength.
The Serbians reported continuing
their advance on the Broda river.
But an official telegram of yesterday
received today mentions only briefly
fighting where Von Mackensen, ac
cording to Bucharest, has been se
verely defeated in his efforts to break
through the Rumanian Russian lines.
The tide of battle In the Rumanian
province of Ikibrudja hag again
turned and is now In favor of the
central powers, according to Berlin.
Von Mackensen succeeded in break
ing the Rumanian-Russian resistance
by executing an encircling movement,
compelling the entente forces to re
treat in disorder. Last night an offi
cial announcement from Bucharest de
dared tbo battle had ended Wednes
day in a defeat for Germans, Bul
garians and Turks, who retreated
southward, burning villages. If the
German victory Is decisive the situa
tion promises to develop seriously for
the Russians and Rumanians.

FRANCE FLOATS LOAN
TO CONTINUE THE WAR
POLICE AND MILITARY ORDERED
HELD IN READINESS EOR ACTIVE
SERVICE AGAINST ANY RIOTING
(By Associated Prras.)
NEW YORK, Sept. 22. Repeated
threats of a great general strike of
700,000 in sympathy with striking
traction employes have caused the
city government, charged with en
forcing the laws, to prepare for an
outbreak of mob violence. The
mayor's notice that he stood ready
to Invoke all the civil and military
power he possessed to suppress dis
order resulted In greater police ac
tivity In warning that persons con
victed of engaging in strike riots
would receive the severest punish
ment. The Laborites representing
the workers were to meet this after
noon to decide whether a sympathy
strike, If ordered, will begin Monday
or Tuesday.
Labor leaders were warned by
Mayor Mitchel last night that he
would employ the "full civil and
military powers conferred upon him
by law to prevent disorders If the
threatened general strike of trade
unions Is called today to aid the
street car employes jWho quit their
places Sept. 6.
The mayor's communication was
addressed to Hugh Frayne, chairman
of the conference committee of labor
leaders, after a final effort to arrange
a peaceful settlement had failed and
following the declaration that a gen
eral strike was inevitable. The mayor
made it plain that for the union offi
cials to call strike would be to
assume full responsibility for all that
may follow. '
"The mayor, representing the civil
forces of government In this city,"
the letter declared, "feels It Incum
bent upon him to say to you now,
before further rash ' step Is taken;
that these duties (to enforce law
and maintain order) the city govern
ment will discharge to the fully, em
ploying, if need be, the entire re
sources to that end. Disorder, as
saults ajid crimes of violence, in
cluding Injury to Innocent citizens,
such as those of Tuesday and Wednes
day, will be. suppressed with a strong
hand and punished with all the vigor
at the comand of the government."
The communication, which was
concurred in by Oscar S. Straus,
chairman of the public service com
mission, reviewed at length the cause
which led to the present crisis. It
stated that the Interborough Rapid
Transit company, which operates the
subway and elevated lines, violated a
verbal agreement with the labor lead
ers by refusing to arbitrate issues
arising, subsequent to the making; of
the agreement.
It stated on the other hand that the
employes of the New York Railways
company and other surface lines
affected by the strike, "were guilty
of a breach" of contracts they had
made with their employers which
ended in a tie-up on the surface roads
in July.
The conference was attended by
Mayor Mitchel, a citizen's committee
and the labor leaders. It ended In
a deadlock. The mayor later ,de-
