Athens, Sept. 21.—Via London,
Sept. 22.—Eliptherious Venizelos, the
former premier and Cretan statesman,
was asked today as to the truth un
derlying repeated reports that he is
going to Salonikt to put himself at the
head of ^a temporary revolutionary
government and, in reply, he declared
to the Associated Press:
"I cannot answer now. I must
wait a brief time yet and see what
the government proposes to do before
deciding on the course it will be best
to adopt in. the event that Greece does
not enter the war.
"As I said on August 27, if the
king will not hear the voice of the
people we must ourselves devise what
is best to do. We do not know what
that will be but a long continuation
of the present situation would be in
tolerable.- Already we have suffered
all the agonies of a disastrous war,
while remaining neutral.
"We have had ten months of mobili
zation with all the consequent hard
ships to the families of the men mob
ilized," while both Balkan wars only
included thirteen months, with great
er funds available for the relief of
the families of the soldiers. Our
boundaries have been Invaded towns,
crops and farms have been destroyed,
and- all horrors enacted. We have
had all the finnctl burdens of war and
the post of maintaining a useless mob
ilization. The morale of the army
which three years ago was at the top
most pitch has been destroyed by In
action and now. Is completely gone.
Then we had a victorious, now we
have a beaten, army.
"We even have more than an en
tire army corps of Greeks held pris
oners of war in a foreign country,
and already we have paid the Bulgars
an Immense war indemnity, amount
ing, in military equipment, property
destroyed and loot of Greek cities oc
cupied, tp more than 40,000,000. Arid
finally we are perhaps on the verge
of making now, at last, that war
which we have not fought, but have
paid for In blood, tears and treasure."
And if Greece does not enter the
war?" he was asked.
"If the German-Bulgars are suc
cessful." replied M. Venlseloe, "cer
tainly all of Macedonia is lost to us.
You have seen what the German-Bul
garlan guarantees are worth In their
written1 pledge that they would not
occupy Kavala, Drama or Serres.
"If. the entente allies are victorious,
as I profoundly believe they will be,
we riak a separate peace between' the
allies and the Bulgars, whereby the
latttor may be permitted to retainthe
QfMk, territory they have ooNtsied

NEWSPAPER
CANADIAN LOSSES
ONSOMMEHEAVY
400 Killed and 1,400 Wound
ed in Great Fight in
Two Days.
Ottawa, Sept. 22.—Beyond the fact
that the Canadians lost 400 killed,
1,200 wounded and 300 mi6aing in the
fighting at Courcellette and Martin
puich on Monday and Tuesday, there
is a dearth of details here as to the
first great offensive in which the
Canadian's participated. At militia
headquarters here they do not even
know what divisions or what regi
ments participated, though it. is now
several days since the Canadians
made their gallant advance.
So.far the only details of the battle
have come from Frederick Palmer,
representing the American A ssociat
ed Press and from Philip Gibbs, a
British correspondent.
The Canadian eye-witness from
last accounts, was still recording
minor bombing and raiding ex
hibitions oh the Ypres salient, and
had not learned of the transfer of
Canadian troops to the Somme. How
ever, as a fortnight has usually
elapsed between the actual battles
and his record of them further details
may bo expected next week.
Consider Losses light.
Authorities consider the compara
tive lightness of casualties on the
first big Canadian offensive as com
pared with their losses in the defen
sive fighting at St. Julien, Festubert
and Zellebeke as significant. It would
appear that it is a more deadly busi
ness to hold ground in the face of a
hostile storm of high explosives than
to take ground prepared before hand
by one's own guns. It would there
fore appear that the Germans' loss
in the present battle must be very
heavy, the situation being reversed.
Total Losses of Canadians.
Ottawa, Sept. 22.—Canadian casu
alties from the beginning of the war
until Aug. 31 totaled 37,861.
Of this number 8,644 are dead—5.
998 having been killed outright in ac
tion, 2,248 having succumbed to their
wounds, and 398 having died of sick
ness.
In addition to the above 723 afe
presumed dead because they have not
been heard of for six months.
The wounded totalled 27,212, and
the missing, including prisoners of
war, 1,282.
Of the wounded probably a third
at least would return to service. The
proportion who have died of sickness
is very small and i's an indication of
the high condition, of the efficiency of
military and medical methods and
the absence of epidemic disease.
In' the South African war those
who died of sickness were more than
those killed.
GERMAN BATTALIONS
NEARLY DESTROYED
Paris, Sept. 22.—Ninety thousand
men, directed personally by Field
Marshal von Hindenburg, took part
in Wednesday's attacks on the new
French positions in the region of
Bouchavesnes, on the Somme, accord
ing to La Liberte's special correspon
dent In the field. Many additional
artillery trains also had been brought
up for the event. The results of the
battle were disastrous for the attack
ing forces, declares the correspon
dent, division after division being
decimated by the French infantry and
machine-gun fire. The fighting was
extraordinarily fierce in the centre of
the region attacked, around Boucha
vesnes and Bois l'Abbe, and at Com
bles and at the Prlez farm, as well as
at Rancourt.
At Priez farm two Prussian bat
talions were nearly destroyed, adds
the correspondent, and a similar fate
was suffered at Rancourt by three
German regiments, which, advancing
in four waves, made the last desper
ate effort of the day. The extent of
the German losses, says the dispatch,
may be estimated by the fact that a
company of the Eleventh Bavarian
Division lost 160 men out of 210,
while regiments elsewhere lost sixty
per cent, of their effectives.

German Infantry Busy.
Paris, Sept. 22.—German infantry,
advancing in waves, made renewed
efforts this morning to beat back the
French from the positions recently
captured north of the Somme. The
official announcement today says that
the -atacka. were -broken, by -French,
artillery before the Germans reached
the 'French' lines, compelling them to
retire to their own trenches after sus
taining heavy losses.
The attacks of the Germans were
made in strong force and centered on
the French positions between .Lepriex
farm and Rancourt.
The French and Serbian troops,
operating along the western end of
the Macedonian front, scored new'
successes against the Bulgarians, it
was officially announced. Serbian
troops, continuing the advance along
the Betoda river, have reached the
neighborhood of Urbani, where 100
prisoners were taken.
North of Fiorina, the Bulgarian at

The Hungarian Diet rejected a mo

oC
Counts Andrassy and Apponyl,
leaders of the opposition, for the con
vocation of delegations, according to
a dispatch to Reuter's. The demand
for the convocation of delegations,
the bodies of which shall consider af
fairs which Austria and Hungary
have in common, was the climax of
a vigorous war which has been
waged against the administration of
Premier Tisza by Andrassy and Ap
ponyl, for several weeks.
The storm, which Premier Tisza
now is reported to have weathered,
reached its height on the entrance o*
Rumania into the ranks of the allies.
The matters the opposition demand

of the Austrian government In ad

inefficiency of the Austro-Hungarian
army administration.
