Lincoln Cnunty Teachers to Hold
Annua! Session in Stanford
The teachers of Lincoln county
wi.l gainer in Stanford next week to
attend the annual teachers insti
tute. No school will be held in any
of the schools of the county as the
law requires this annual meeting of
the pedagogues for the purpose of
exchanging ideas and otherwise
"brushing up" on latest and best
methods of instructing the little
ones.
Supt. Garland Singleton, is mak
ing active preparations for one of
the best institutes the teachers of
Lincoln county have ever held. He
has not engaged one single instruc
tor for the whole week but hopes to
have several big men in the educa
tional world here to talk to the
teachers. Amone them are Super
intendent of Public Instruction V. 0.
Gilbert, from Frankfort, Prof. Mc
Henry Rhoads, state supervisor of
High Schools, and the newlv elected
President T. J. Coates. of the East
ern State Normal School at Rich
mond. Supt. Singleton plans to
make next Thursday Trustees' day
of the Institute and to have State
Superintendent Gilbert here that
day to talk to the trustees of coun
tv schools especially. Supt. W. C.
Wilson, of the Stanford City Schools,
will start of the program as instruc
tor on Mondv and earlv in the week
until the "big guns" in the school
ranks come to town. Attendance
upon the institute proceedings is
compulsory, so a large number of
clmnl taches will be visitors in
Stanford next week. The sessions
will be held in the circuit court room
in the court house.
The program for Thursday after
noon, has been so planned as to be
of vital interest to all natrons and
trustees. On this date the subjects,
"The Relation of the Countv Church
to the Rural School," and "The Re
lation of the Home to the School."
will be very ably discussed by the
local ministers. A part of the pro
gram will be a review of the Course
of Study, a book which all the teach
ers will bring to the Institute.

Aid The Kidneys
Stanford Sufferers Should Take
Further Risk
No
Why will people continue to suf
fer the agonies of kidney complaint,
backache, urinary disorders, lame
ness, headaches, languor, why allow
themselves to become chronic in
valids, when a tested remedy is of-
lered them.'
Doan's Kidney Pills have been
used in kidney trouble over 50 years,
have been tested in thousands of
cases.
If you have any, even one, of the
symptoms of kidney diseases, act
now, for" gravely dropsy or Bright's
disease may set in and make neglect
dangerous. Can Stanford residents
demand more convincing proof than
the following?
Amelia Camden, Preachersville,
Kentucky, says. "I suffered intense
ly from kidney complaint and when
I stooped, I could hardly straighten.
Dark spots often floated before my
eves and my head pained me until I
was almost crazy. A neighbor told
me about Doan's Kidney Pills and I
rot a box. They helped me from
the first and I am now free from
kidney complaint."
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don t
rsimplv ask for a kidney remedy
get Doan's Kidney Pills the same
that Mrs. Camden had. Foster

Forget Your Aches
Stiff knees, aching' limbs, lame
back make life a burden. If you suf
fer from rheumatism, gout, lumbago,
neuralgia, get a bottle of Sloan's Lin-
imentt, the universal remedy for
pain. Easy to apply; it penetrates
without rubbing and soothes the ten
der flesh. Cleaner and more effect
ive than mussy ointments or poulti
ces, ror strains or sprains, sore mus
cles or wrenched ligaments resulting
from strenous exercise, Sloan's Lini
ment gives quick relief. Keep it on
hand for emergencies. At vour Drug

Once Famous Ball Playsr Says. He s
Through With Diamond.
Howard Camnitz, the once great
Pittsburg National League base ball
pitcher, was in Danville Thursday
with his wife and handsome little
four-year-old son. They have been
visiting his parents, Mr. and Mrs. H.
K. Camnitz, formerly of Huston
ville, where Howard was born and
raised and played his first base ball.
Mr. Camnitz has been out of the
national game for about a year. He
has just sold out his profitable ga
rage business in Louisville, and is
now looking for a farm, upon which
he says he will settle down for the
balance of his life and where he will
rear his boy. Though he says that
already the youngster shows signs of
manifesting an unusual interest in
base ball for one so young. Mr.
Camnitz has been urged to secure a
place back in "old Kentucky" but
says that prices on blue grass land
are held at, a very much higher fig
ure than land of about the same
quality in Indiana or Illinois and he
will probably secure a farm in one
of those states, though he hopes to
buy as close to Louisville as he can
as that is the home of Mrs. Camnitz.
"Cammy," as the once famous pitch
er was known, to the "boys" who
once played with him on the back
lots of Stanford and Hustonville, is
looking fine, and his friends have
been hoping that he would yet stage
a "comeback" on the big time dia
mond, but he ays he is through, and
plans to settle down as an honest
farmer for the rest of his life. He
is being given a cordial welcome in
Danville and in this section, where
he has always been very popular.
LINCOLN MAN BUYS FARM
Lincoln county furnished the pur
chaser of the B. F. Robinson farm,
east of Danville, at Mr. Robinson's
sale Wednesday. Ed Cr Eubanks, of
Moreland, this county, bought the
place for himself and his sister at his
bid of $122.51 an acre. There are 187
acres in the place, most of it said to
be first class land. A big crowd was
on hand for the sale as Mr. Robin
son had advertised extensively. Live
stock sold well. W. W. Johnson, of
Boyle, bought a pair of five-year-old
mare mules for $405; and Mack B.
Eubanks, of Boyle, paid $355 for an
other pair of five-year-old mare hy
brids. His friends says that Mr.
Robinson plans to go either to Rich
mond or to Mississippi to locate.
BUYS FINE HAMPSHIRE RAM
While in Louisville at the State
Fair last week, J. Fox Dudderar, of
Rowland, purchased one of the hand
somest ram lambs seen in this sec
tion in some time. It is of the
Hampshire breed, and was bred at
the famous Walnut Hall stock farm
near Lexington. This ram won at
the Columbus, O., and the Detroit
shows, and cost his new owner a cool
$75. Mr. Dudderar will use him
with his large flock of Hampshire
ewes. He is very partial to this
breed, as they grow much larger
sheep than either the Southdown or
the Shropshire, which are the two
breeds usually handled by sheep
breeders in this part of the state.
BOOSTING RED GOOSE SHOES
Phillips & Phillips, local merchants
pulled off a nifty advertising stunt
Thursday afternoon, when R. H.
Henton representing the manufactu
rers of the fanuuis Red Goose school
shoes, put a gigantic "red goose" on
the streets in front of their store,
and then sent up a balloon with a
long streamer attached. Several
hundred people witnessed the dis
play and the youngsters chased the
balloon as it soared in a northwest
wind. Hubert Fish, young son of
Mr. and Mrs. W.
balloon and dts
S. Fish caught thej
streamer when it
landed and by so doing secured a
handsome pair of Red Goose school
shoes as a gift from this popular
and hustling firm.

From Mrs. Thurmond
Ash Grove, Mo., Sept. L0, 1916
Editor Interior Journal :-r-
I have been requested through the
medium of your paper to answer
ereetiners sent by my "Old Kentuc-
ky" friends upon the anniversary ot
my 82nd birthday, August 10, 1916.
'Tis indeed a source of much
pleasure in declining years to.be re
membered by old friends, and espe
cially those of Old Given's church,
which has long since ceased to be,
and many of the loved ones have
passed to yonder shining shore, yet
the one treasured spot iVi memory
is the old home so near the church,
where all our children were born,
five girls and six boys and rear
ed. The three oldest girls and old
est boy were married, before Mr.
Thurmond and I came Westin 1880,
and settled on a farm near Ash
Grove, Mo., where we lived until the
other children were married, when
we moved to town, about 1902 to
be near the church which 1 enjoy
attending as much as ever; in fact
I seldom miss a Lord's Day being
at Bible school and church services.
Mr. Thurmond, as many of your
readers know, departed this life in
April 1909. Since then have had
some of my grandchildren with me,
and my children, Henry, John, Er
nest, Mary and Lula and their fam
ilies all live in and near Ash Grove;
W. P. Thurmond lives at Decatur,
Texas, O. J., at Danville, Ky.; Emma
L. King at Milton, Ky.; Flora Carne
ghy at Merkel, Texas; Ethyl Graves
at Marion, Mo.; Jeff at Lodi, Cal.
Ours is a record I am indeed thank
ful. Of our living children all have
married and have their own homes:
all Christians, and most of them take
active part in church work.
Have 33 living grand-children, 7
dead; 20 living great-grandchildren,
3 dead.
Two of my sons, O. J., of Dan
ville, Ky., W. P., of Decatur, Tex.,
and daughter, Ethyl Graves, of Ma
rion, Ohio, visited me this past Aug
ust. We all enjoyed a happy, reun
ion talked much of the Old Ken
tucky Home, friends and relatives,
and should it ever be their pleasure
to visit Ash Grove,' Mo., will gladly
extend to them the hand of wel
come and the Old Kentucky hospi
tality. Mrs. J. L. Thurmond.

Circus Monkey Escapes
Small Member of Ape Family at
Large West of Stanford
A small monkey escaped from the
Sparks Famous Shows which exhibit
ed here Wednesday, and so far has
not been recaptured though the
whereabouts of the "varmint" are
fairly well known. The animal made
his escape some time before the
night performance and struck out
west of town. T. D. Raney return
ing frqm the West End Wednesday
night, and driving in on the Knob
Lick pike saw the monkey on the
road near the home of Ed Davis. He
thought it was a ground hog at first.
When Mr. Raney drove up the monk
jumped on the fence and started for
a tree. Mr. Raney said that he had
no desire just then to "monkey"
with the monkey so came on to town
and reported what he had seen. News
came to town Thursday that the
member of the ape family was in a
tree on the farm of Mr. Davis, and
a "possee" of seven men headed by
Capt. Harry Carter went out in au
tomobiles after him but returned
empty-handed. Col. Sparks, proprie
tor of the circus told Mr. Carter
that he would pay a reward of $10
for the capture and return of the
monkey. Many believe that the on
ly way he will be captured will be
with a shotgun and after that he will
hardly be fit for exhibition pur
poses. SPARKS' CIRCUS A GOOD ONE
The Sparks World-Famous circus
was greeted by good crowds at both
of its performances here Wednesday
and everyone seems to have been well
pleased with the show. Some really
splendid acts were on the program;
in fact but little was offered that
was not high class. Everything was
clean and nothing but compliments
were heard for the entire perform
ance from beginning to end. It was
one of the best two-ring circuses ev
er seen in Stanford and nothing too
good can be said of it or its genial
proprietor, Col. Sparks, and his ac
commodating staff. The show went
to Campbellsville from here.
The Sparks show appeared here
with only four elephants, as Mary, a
big elephant which killed her trainer
at Kingsport, Tenn., last week, was
hanged at Ervin, Tenn., Thursday.
A railroad derrick car was used in
the execution. The animal was
forced to the track by other ele
phants, heavy chains were tied
around her neck and she was hoisted
into the air. She was valued at
about $20,000 by Col. Sparks.
