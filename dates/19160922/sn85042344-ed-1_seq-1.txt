prevent tho lynching. She hid the Jail
keys, called additional guards and
summoned tho fire department while
her husband silently was watching the
mob break into Dudley's cell.
Only one clew and that a meager
one, as to the Identity of any of the
mob has beon found. It is a small
card that was found tacked on the
telephone polo. It read:
"Bert Dudley was hanged from tho
neck on tills pole until dead, Sept.

The card Is supposed to havo been
wiltten by one of the lynchers and
Sheriff Carroll said It might be possi
