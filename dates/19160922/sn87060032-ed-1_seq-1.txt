REV. S. P. WEST'S
FUNERAL FU1DAY
Who Died In Chitdsburq
Is Buried Here
(From Talladega, Ala., News.)
Rev. S. P. West, aged 58, died
Wedne day night at Childers
burg. He is survived by his
widow, two daughters, Miss Mil
ton West, and Mrs. Read P. Black
of Barbourville, Ky., and three
sons. Warren West, Holland West
and Paul West of Birmingham.
The announcement of the death
of Mr. West created much sor
row in this city where he was
well known and resided for a
number of years. In addition to
occupying prominent pulpits in
the North Alabama Conference,
he had served as financial agent
of the Methodist Orphanage and
as editor of the Alabama Chris
tian Advocate.
He organized and managed the
first Chautauqua ever conducted
in Alabama at Shelby Springs,
which was later the Alabama
Chautauqua for several years con
ducted in this city. Mr. West
was a man of wonderful resour
ces and energy and his death is a
distinct loss to the Methodist de
nomination. Mr. West married Miss Eva
Cowen, daughter of the late Mr.
and Mrs. E. A. Cowen, pioneer
citizens of Talladega.
Mr. West suffered a stroke of
paralysis several months ago
which ultimately resulted in his
death. He was pastor of the
Childersburg circuit.
The funeral services of tho late
Rev. S. P. West who died at
Chiltlsburg Wednesday evening
were held at the First Methodist
Church in this city Friday after
noon conducted by Rev. Frank
W. Brandon of Anniston, assist
ed by Dr. S. L. Dobbs, presiding
elder of the Talladega district
and Rev. K. N. Mathews, pastor
of the First Methodist church.

Many of the friends of Mr.

church the remains was conveyed

THE KINDLED FIRE
(By Walter 1 1 run i
A number of bretliern and sis
PromiiicnLMcthodistMimslcrtcrsnU!tat, the Baptist Church
of Artenuis, Ky.. on Saturday
morning, Sept. 10, 1910, at ten
o'clock for the purpose of holding
a Sunday School Institute. E. W.
Roach of Barbourville conducted
the devotional exercises and lead
1 Cor. 13, as a scripture lesson.
It is to be hoped that that love
v.hich makes every honest effort
a success was in the heart of
everyone present.
The meeting was organized
with Rev. J. A. Lowry as Moder
ator, and Rev. Walter Hurd as
Clerk. High-sounding titles
were cast aside, and tho organi
zation was called simply a Work
el's' Meeting. This practical
spirit was present through all the
session. Discussions were con
fined to the business at hand, and
some tilings were said that are
food for thought.
The great value to be derived
from Institutes and workers'
meetings was appropriately con
sidered first. New ideas are
gained, new methods discussed,
and practical conclusions are
reached. The great needs of the
Sunday School field are also
brought before us in an impres
sive manner. These thoughts
were given by Dr. Lowry and
Rev. Hurd.
The afternoon session began
by singing the hymn, "I Want
to be a Worker," and as we sang
hearts were lifted up, and some
determined to enter the ripened
harvest-fields.
"The Superintendent as a
Man," was discussed b G. W.
Nicholson. The Fact that a
Superintendent should by all
means be a christian was empha
sised. Prayer and the qualities
of leadership, an energetic spirit,
eecutive ability, broad vision,
loyalty to church, and love for
children were given as some of
the essentials which fit a Supt. to
be discribed by the word MAN.
The Superintendents of our Sun
da" Schools hold responsible po
sitions, and souls are hanging in
the balances.
E. W. Roach said that no teach
er has any business of going be
fore a class without having thor
oughly prepared his lesson. In
this preparation the definite order
of prayer, reading Scripture text,
study of lesson helps, and then
preparation of questions should
be observed. Conscientious pre
paration on the part of every
teacher would greatly increase
tho efficiency of our Sunday
Schools.
that the Supt. must be a " live
wire." Being on tune, .saerific-
ing personal pleasures for the
sake of being kind to a pupil, and
making preparation for each
school session are items that de
mand energy and industry. A
lazy man who cannot move with
to manv a Sundav school.
In many schools, teachers are
to be found who are not in direct
sympathy with the church, com
mon sense forbids the keeping of
such persons. A teacher should

On the south side of the river
there will soon be seven miles of
the road graded; on the Big Rich
land route there will soon be sev
en miles completed; and with the
three miles that Sam Jackson has
already completed, and the eight
miles that is now under way,
leaves the route to Corbin the
only one not contracted; this is
held up pending an injunction
sued out by those who contend
that the road should go by the
Paint Hill route instead of the
Middlefork of Richland route. It
is the hope of every man in the
county that this will soon be set
tled, so that we may know where
the route through the county
will be located, and when the
contract will be let.

Congressman L. C. Dyer, of
Missouri, will address the voters
of Knox county at the court
house in Barbourville, Ky., on
Thursday, September 23th at
7:30 p. m.
Mr. Dyer is one of the best
speakers in the United States
and you should come out to hear
him. He will present the issues

Big Damage
In the Circuit Court last week
the Jury in the case of Noble
Steele against the L. & N. R. R.
Co. brought in a verdict in faor
of the plaintiff for the sum of
$10,500.00. Steele is eight years
old. and in borne manner he lost

certainly be a member of the
church in which he is teaching
that be may be able to do his
work conscientiously.
A sudden stillness passed over
the congregation. Miss Thomas
of the Barbourville Baptist In
stitute rose and sang of the
world's great need for "A Little
Bit of Love." As she sang we
heard a voice calling to us to
come out into the by-paths of life
and lift up the weak and the
fallen.
"There are many young people
in our county who need to be in
a Sunday school." said Mathew
McKeehan. If the Sunday schools
would recognize their social na
ture, and give them some practic
al work to do, present conditions
would be greatly improved. Some
form of class of organization ap-
peals to young people also. ,
.Mrs. John W. Ihnrhes snoke
on "Primary Folks and How to!1'1-1920
Teach Them." Her experience
with little folks was very instruc
tive, and her methods of keeping
! them busy would piove a blessing
to our Sunday Schools. "Give
them something to do" is the
plain advice of Mrs. Hughes.
Thus the fire is kindled and
may its flames of uplifting
thought leap to other Churches
that are sinking in idleness.
