Peanati v. Cotton
The Opelika News continues
the practice of laudinj? the pen.
nut as a great aid to the South
ern farmer. That fully alive
daily recites an incident, report
ed by the Hurtsboro Tribune.
where a farmer had only 100
acres of peanuts in the field to
show his banker to whom he
owed $1,900. The banker did
not think it was so bad a show
ing:. He said he would cancel
the farmer's note and give him
$5,000 to boot for the produce
iust as it stood. The banker is
narvestiag $6,800 on the peanuts,
and will have about $1,800 of hay
in addition. "Good night, cot
ton!" exclaims the News Mo
bile Register.
Ordinarily a man's wealth
shrinks after his death, but not
so with the estate of Anthony N.
Brady of Albany, New York,
who died in 1914 worth $84,
000,000, and whose property now
has a value of $100,000,000. For
example, Mr. Brady bought
stock of the General Motors
Company, worth the less than
$100 a share, and the present
quotation is $700. It is said that
a man's money works while
he is asleep. Here is a lot of it
that worked while the man was
dead. Mobile Register.

Sharp Deterioration in Cotton
The Times-Picayune presented
its" Monday reports on the cot
ton crop, as of Sept. 7. The
concensus of opinion is to the
following effect:
1. A very shary deterioration
has occurred since the previous
report, taking the belt as a
whole, and the accounts from
some districts are distressing.
2. The boll-weevil has
wrought havoc over wide areas,
more especially in Alabama and
Mississippi.
3 The supply of labor is re
ported sufficient in most cases,
but there appears to be a scarci
ty wherever the weevil has done
its worst, as laborers have been
driven to seek a living in the
towns, or on public works.
4. Farmers seem generally
disposed to sell at current prices
at least enough of the crop to
pay them out of debt, but would
doubtless resist any important
decline.
Can Enliat for One Year
In the Naval appropriation bill
approved August J9, 1916, is in
corporated an article that should
prove very attractive to boys
and young men who are think
ing of enlisting in the U. S.
navy.
This article is to the effect
that after A izu-l i.9. 1916, any
man who theivtfter enlists in
the J. S. N iv., . n ay, if he so
elects, alter the completion of
one year's serv.ee at sea, be dis
charged if:i I he U- S. navy,

the months of June and Decem
ber the yr.ir U llowing, provided
he is not in diLt to the govern
ment, and tl fct his conduct is
such as to warn nt this favor.

The government estimate of the
l'JH! cotton crop, based on the
conditions of August 25th, is 11,
H0(),0()0 bates. That was about
the size of the 1915 crop, but the
1914 crop was 10,134,9.10 bales.
The July storms caused a loss in
production calculated at 1,350,.
000 bales.
The announcement of the Wil
son Independent League that the
Hull Moose have stampeded to

corn crsation of an old Dutchman
with his small boy along about

"How many vas dey!" "Vun.''

People who complain of the in
creased price of milk should re
member that they have been urg
ing their legislatures to protect
them from dirty dairies aud care,
less farmers by passing pure milk
laws. You cannot have improve
ments of that kind without pay
ing for them, but the cent or t wo
additional that each quart of
milk costs is the most wisely
spent money in the United States.
An engineer connected with the
New York Central Pail road sys
tem is said to have discovered a
way to detect hidden imperfec

the death of more than two hun
