HUGHES ASSAILS
THE 8-HOUR LAW

AMHON Itll.li SURRENDER TO
politic l expediency.
GREETED BY CROWDS
t'undlduto Clict'itMl nt Springfield As
Ho IIckIiin Second Trip Of
CiiiiiiiiIkiiIiik
Springfield, 111.. Sept. 10. Charles
. , K Hughes, nddrefcalng an nudlenco
f In -the Arsenal here tonight,, renew
ed IiIh attack on the Administration
for the passage of the Adamson law
in the face of the threatened railroad
fltrlke. Mr. Hughes discussed and
called "futile" reasons advocated for
its pugRago, quoted from President
Wilson's address to Congress on the
subject, challenged the statement of
Representative Adamson that it was
passed to meet an emergency, and
cited a declaration attributed to
Orovr Cleveland in support of the
contention that the law was a "sur
render to force'
"We have seen," Mr. Hughes said,
"what appears to be the considera
tion of immediate political qxnedl
encj at, the oxpenso of public welfare.
Mr Adamson said, 'it is hasty legis
lation, I admit, to meet an emergen
cy.' Wlyat emergency? The emer
gency of force to which the Adminis
tration had capitulated.
"Senator Underwood said, 'Wo
have no Information on which to leg
islate and to fix rates of wages which
we are going to do and aro attempt
ing to do.
"Contrast the action of the Admin
istration," the nominee added, "with
what was said by Grovcr Cleveland In
1SS6 with respect to labor legisla
tion. " 'All legislation on the subject
should bo calmly and deliberately
undertaken with no purpose of sat
isfying unreasonable demands or
saining partisan advantage.
Kycumj Culled Idle.
"It Is idle to excuse the action by
the roquest for additional legislation
with respect to the future. That
legislation was not obtained. Wo
aro dealing with what was demand
ed and actually enacted.
"We have an unjustifiable attempt
to uuo public sentiment with respect
to an eight-hour working day In or
ler to justify a bill which does not
provide an eight-hour work day, but
relates solely to an Increase in wages.
Wo havo seen tlio choice of what
jteemed to bo the easier way, which
escaped the necessity of a detcrmln
f oil stand for principle, We havo seen
what appeared to bo the considera
tion of immedinte political expedi
ency at the expense of public wel
fare." Mr. Hughes spoko before a crowd
ri house. His speech tonight was
ills second in Springfield. The first,
nt tho State fair grounds this after
noon, dealt chiefly with his ideas on
protection of American Industries,
American rights and preparedness.
JIu also touched tonight on tho pro
tection of American rights.
"Tho America of which I hnvo a
vision, tho America of tho future is
an America maintaining American
rights ou land and sea without fear
or favor thruout tho world."
The audience cheered and upplaud
ed aioudly.

OhcSiWo Concern -Guarantees Tlint
Wetnl Will Do ReceUetl Here
This Fall.
At a meeting of the stockholders
of tho allrtford Tobacco Warehouse
Company In their building hero Sat
urday the local bouse was leased to
the Ross-Vaughan Tobacco Compa
ny, of Owensbaro. Forty-seven of
the ninety-four votes were present
In person and twenty-seven by proxy.
The entire vote with the exception
of three was cast In favor of leasing
the house to tho Ross-Vaughan Com
pany. The American Society of Equity
and tho Co-Operative Tobacco Grow
ers' Association had asked that tho
house bo held for them but neith
er society was willing to make any
sort of contract that they would lease
It. It seems that a majority of tho
stockholders favored one of the two
societies but they wero unwilling to
wait on them with no guarantee and
take the chances of having thoir-prop-crty
unused this year as It has been
in the past.
The Ross-Vaughan company volun
tarily made a $5,000 bond that tobac
co would be bought and received hero
this fall. The Ross-Vaughan peo
ple are said to bo good people for
tho farmer to deal with and It 13
expected that they will do an enor
mous business hero this fall.
Contrary to reports little damago
lias been done to Ohio county tobac
co by tho recont frosts. Tho damago
to tho entlro crop Is estimated at
less than $1,000 and tho farmer
should get a good price for tho weed
this ear.
