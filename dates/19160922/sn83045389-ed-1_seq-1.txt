against a party, which usually draws
its support from the moneyed interests
of the country, is badly in need of
funds. Thousands of dollar* must bo
expended each day in sending out
speakers and literature, maintaining j
campaign headquarters, and paying t^f

architecture, wit large tower built
in one corner extending some distance
above the roof proper. The building
will be three stories high, with an un

The plans call for many ornamental
windows, giving a striking appear
