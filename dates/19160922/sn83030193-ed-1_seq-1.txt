Reports issued to-day by the Berlin War Office not only
cast doubt on the reported defeat of Field Marshal von
Mackensen, but claim a big victory for his combined Teuton,
Bulgar and Turkish forces.
An official statement issued last night at Bucharest said
von Mackensen's troops in Dobrudja had been defeated after a
six days' battle and that they were destroying villages in their
y?J. retreat. Bulgarjaa.offjdaLrcports, issued, yesterday and received
' to-day mentioned very briefly the fifming in Dobrudja. It coy
s ered the action only until Wednesday, the day .on which
Bucharest claimed the battle ended in victory. The Berlin
report to-day declares von Mackensen, by means of an encir
cling counter attack, had driven the Russians and Roumanians
back in disorder.
Reports from the other battle fronts, although from
friendly sources, arc cheering to the Allies. British troops in
the Somme sector are said to have advanced on a mile front
south of the Ancre, capturing two lines of trenches. Paris
claims that 'German attacks in force on the French end of the
Somme front were repulsed and that the French and Serbian
troops had made important gains in Macedonia.

MONDAY; FEAR NO
PARALYSIS SPREAD
Mayor Makes the Announce-
ment After Consulting With
Emerson and Willcox.
DANGER "NEGLIGIBLE."
Dr. Holt of Babies' Hospital
So Reports on the Assem
bling of Children.
The public schools will open Mon
day. All tho Roman Catholic
parochial schools In tho archdiocese
will open at tho same time. This an
nouncement was made this morning
by Mayor Mltchel after a conference
In City Halt with Health Commissioner
Haven Emerson and William a. Will
cox, President of the Board of Edu
cation. "liecauWof ,lhe talk or further
danger from Infantlfo paralysis," said
the Mayor at the conclusion of his con
ference with the school and health
officials, "I decided to get the ultimate
Judgment of those best qualified to
speak on tho question of school open
ing. Both Dr. Emerson and President
Willcox agree In their opinion that
thoro Is no reason why the schools
can't bo opened on Monday."
President Willcox announced that
Dr. L. Emmet Holt, head of the
Rabies' Hospital, believes that there
will bo no danger of a now epidemic
of Infantile paralysis If the schools
open Monday. In a personal letter
to Mr. Wlllro. Dr. Holt says:
"Itegardlng the question of school
opening I have a pretty definite opin
ion. With the precautions which Dr.
Emerson has announced will be
taken, and with the steady subsi
dence of tho .epidemic noted In the
past ten days (which also follows pre
vious experience with this disease)
I believe that the Increased dangers
from assembling children In public
schools are negligible.
"It Is probable that occasional
cases wilt occur through the month
of October and perhaps also Novem
ber, but I do not think this number
would bo materially lessened if the
public schools were not to olen until
December'.'
Father Smith, superintendent of
the parochial schools In the Roman
Catholic Archdlocoso of New York,
called up tho Mayor's office and wrote
a letter to the Health Department on
the question of opening tha schools
next Mondoy. Father Smith expressed
tho opinion that tho schools should bo
pormlttcd to open Monday.
There are 1SS.0OO children In tho
parochial schools of tho city.
President Willcox snys 95 per cent,
of the public school children are back
In town, so that It Is not a question of
bringing them from tho country Into
a new danger zone. During the cp.
dcinlc, he explained, thrro were not
less than 75,000 children attending the
summer schools and tho playgrounds.
Their freedom from tho epidemic was
marked.
"Many of us bellevo that children
are likely to avoid disease by attend
ing school," said Mr. Willcox.
Tho attention of Dr. Emerson wus
culled to tho fact that the Huston
schools' opening has been postponed
until Oct. 3. Ho said Massachusetts
was tho only Statu In this section of
tho country In which thoro Is an In
crease In paralysis cases. Massa
chusetts having been ono of tho last
Htntcn visited by tho epidemic, It
would have to run Its courso thcro,
as elsewhere, It wad explained.
President Willcox was usked If
nervous parents who refuse to send
their children to school nut week
would bo punished under the com
uulhory education law. Ho mulled
In reply. It Is undet stood tho seliool

at a Longacre Hotel.
So determined aro tho Federal au
thorities that the alleged blackmail
gang, which bled largo sums from ter
rified men and women, shall be un
covered to Its furthost ramification
that even the wealth and prominence
of Its victims In this and other cities
Is not to be considered when the
swlndlers.are brought to trial here.
Tho Government's first action against
the four alleged mombers of the gang,
Frank Crocker, George Irwin and
William and George Butler, will bo
taken In Philadelphia, where they are
to be tried for obstructing Justice In
the kidnapping of Mrs. Begins A.
Kllppcr, who charges that they black
mailed her In a hotel In this city.
The determination to hold thn first
trial In Philadelphia was announced
to-day by Bpeclal Agent Garbarlno
upon his roturn from n conference
with department heads at Washing
ton. After that the trial of thn al
leged gilt-edged blackmailers will be
shifted to New York, us many of their
most successful operations ugaliut
wealthy persona wero carried out
here.
The Federal authorities recognize
tho seriousness of calling to the stand
some of tho prominent women nnd
men who have been fleeced by the
blackmailers and ono Government of
ficial went so far to-day as to say
that he believed the sulcldo of more
than one victim would result from
the issue of subpoenas.
In Its work of blackmail the gang
used as Its chief weapon the Mann
White Slave Act. There Is soma dls.
cusslon In Washington as to possible
changes In thn wording of the statute
tp remove tho possibilities of bluck.
mall under It. Federal authorities say
that thero will be few prosecutions
under the law In futuro except whore
coercion or commercialism is In
volved. Tho hunt for members In this city
has already begun, becuuso tbe Gov.
erumont authorities believe that prac
tically every blackmailing case they
huve discovered had Its Incoptlun or
some part of Its plot laid In New
York.
A hotel near Longacre Square has
been reported to the Federal agents
as the headquartors of certain mem
bers of tho powerful coterie, and to
day It was said that employees of
this establishment would be closely
questioned.
