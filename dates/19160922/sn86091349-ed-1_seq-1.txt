STATE DEMOCRATIC
COMMITTEE ORGANIZED
Reported difficulty in selecting an
executive committee that would be
acceptable to all candidates, delayed
the convening of the democratic state
central committee at the Overland
hotel last night until shortly after 10
o'clock. Before 8 o'clock the demo
cratic stalwarts were in evidence.
Among these were E. E. Caine of
Elko, candidate for congress; Dis
trict Attorney J. A. Sanders of Tono
pah; John Edwards Bray, superin
tendent of public instruction; Jus
tice Tatrick II. McCarran, Raymond
T. Baker, William Kennett of Elko,
candidate for clerk of the supreme
court, and others.
The executive committee named by
the central body consists of S. M.
Pickett, William McKnight, James T.
Boyd, Charles B. Henderson, George
B. Thatcher, Prince A. Hawkins, R.
H. Cole, Norman Barry and Frank
McAvoy.
S. M. Pickett and William Mc
Knight were re-elected respectively
chairman and secretary of the state
central committee. State Journal. '
REPUBLICAN STATE
COMMITTEE ORGANIZES
The county tickets have been chos
en and now it is up to the voters of
Lincoln county to determine who the
legislative and county officers for the
next two years shall be. Last Tues
day was convention day in Pioche;
and a lively day it was particularly
in the Democratic convention which
met in the court room of the county
court house and where there were
several contests, as well as some very
distinct surprises.
The Republican convention was
less attractive to spectators for the
reason that in contrast to what was
happening over in the Democratic
fold, everything moved along har
moniously and without a single hitch
to seriously Interrupt the proceed
ings. In the Republican convention,
there were no contests for any office
excepting that of recorder and aud
itor where a vote was taken result
ing 5 to 6 in'favor of Ellis Riding of
Callente, against Mrs. -. Charlotte
Quackenbush. All other nominations
were made by acclamation.
Before the Democratic convention
convened it was pretty generally be
lieved that there "would be some
thing doing." So that was where
the crowd went. There was talk of
slates, frame-ups, etc. in the air and
whether that was the case or not,
the convention proved to be intensely
interesting to those who sat outside
fthe jrall and rather too Interesting
for some of those who saw their po
litical aspirations sink into oblivion
at least for the time being. Of
course, there were some sore spots
left which may take time to heal.
However, the Democrats, as well as
the Republicans put up a good ticket
and it will be a battle royal from
now on until election day, which
happens this year on November 7th.
The nomination of state senator fell
to W. T. Stewart, Sr., of Alamo, who
had no opponent and his nomination
was made by acclamation. The mat
ter of an assemblyman set heads to
guessing.. No one had an Inkling
who was out for the nomination, or
who was likely (to get the coveted
plum, until F. C. Lee of Panaca and
C. W. Garrison, present county re
corder and auditor and owner of the
Pioche-Atlanta-Geyser stage line,
were named. Mr. Lee declined to
run and this left the field open to Mr.
Garrison, who was declared the nom
inee. For assessor, there was no op-
ner and walked off with the bacon.
But the real surprise camo when the
nomination of district attorney was
called for. Up to a day or two nro-
vious, everyone believed that A. L.
Scott would be the nominee of the
contention without any opposition.
Mr. Scott thought so himself, for he
had been led to believe that the
present incumbent of the office, Wm.
E. Orr, would not be a candidate
again; for Mr. Orr had told him so.
Billy" did have his mind made up
to stay out of politics entirely this
year for several reasons. But pres
sure was brought to bear, and "Bi'-
ly" changed his mind. He told the
convention that he had informed Mr.
Scott he would not be a candidate;
but that his friends had come to him
and had demanded of him to stay in
the district attorney's office for at
least another term; so if the dele
gates insisted that he should answer
the party's call he would consent and
accept the nomination at their hands.
Meanwhile Mr. Scott requested his
sponsor not to present his name as a
candidate before the convention. Mr.
Orr's nomination was then made
unanimous.
The contest for the nomination for
long and short term commissioner
also proved an interesting feature
of the convention. For the long
term nomination Will Hammond of
Eagle Valley, E. C. D. Marriage of
Pioche, and Phil Mathews of Panaca
sparred for first position. The latter
won easily. For the short term com
mlsslonershlp, James Ryan and W.
M. Christian were contestants, the
former winning with a good many
votes to spare. Wilma B. Warren
was nominated for long term mem
ber of the county board of education,
which ended the work of the conven
tion; except the naming and organiz
ing of a county central committee.
Both conventions met at the same
hour, 11 o'clock. The Republicans
gathered at Miners' Union hall. This
meeting was called to order by H. E.
Freudenthal, chairman of the county
committee, who was made permanent
chairman; and Dr. W. W. Stockham,
secretary. The Democrats were call
ed to order in the court house by N.
J. Wadsworth, county caairmau At
tii'S gathering, W. T, Stewart, Sr.
was made permanent chairman, and
Henry H. Lee, secretary. In both
meetings the forenoon business con-
The Republican state central com
mittee today elected George L. San
ford of Carson as its chairman for
the ensuing two years. The commit
tee not pursuant to the directions of
the state convention which was in
session here on September 5. Mr.
Sanford has been chairman of the
committee for the last two years.
The committee also named B. F.
Curler of Elko as the party candidate
for long term regent of the universi
ty. Judge Curler is a former resi
dent of Reno and served two terms
as district judge of Humboldt, Chur
chill and Washoe counties. He was
the unanimous choice of the state
central committee as the party's can
didate for long term regent.
At the time the state' convention
nominated the party ticket, only one
candidate for long term regent was
named. The convention placed the
nomination of a second long-term
regent in the hands of the state cen
tral committee.
Today's meeting was held at the
Golden hotel and was attended by
members from all over the state. In
addition to choosing a chairman,
other important business in connec
tion with the campaign was transact

position to Dan J. Ronnow, and he elsted of effecting an organization
was likewise nominated. J. A. Nes
bitt was placed in nomination for
sheriff. Jim had no opposition and
the nomination was his. A test of
strength came when the nominations
for recoruer and auditor were called
for. For this place, Joe Hammond
of Eagle Valley had announced his
candidacy some weeks ago, as did
Alex Lloyd of Pioche. Both ha.l
hopes of wincing until Mrs. Jennie
Wilcox, present deputy clerk and
treasurer, entered the contest, on
convention morning, Lloyd dropped
out, throwing his support to Ham
mond, but Mrs. Wilcox toad a major
ity of the deegates on her side aud
won over Hammond, hands down.
The next interesting contest was
that U.t the nomlnaticr. for county
clerk. This laid between W. M. Carg
man of Pioche, and W. A. Denton,
who hails from the town of Caliente,
the latter proved to he au easy win-
and the naming of committees on
platforms, etc. Both conventions
convened again at 2 o'clock P. M.,
when the committees reported. The
reports were adopted and the nomin
ating speeches began. The Republi
cans organized their new central
committee after the real work of the
convention had been completed.
STATES JOIN HANDS WITH
UNCLE SAM BY NEW ACT
NEW ROAD MAKING IN
PROGRESS BELOW PANACA
-Sheriff Dan Ronnow has begun a
campaign of road improvement be
tween Panaca and Caiente and in a
much needed pace in the vicinity of
Hans Oson's ranch. No county in
the state has any worse roads than
this county and the need of work of
this kind is apparent on every hand.
W. A. Denton and daughter, of
Callente, were in town over Tuesday
The federal-aid road act and an
other law the co-operative agricul
tural extension act that the depart
ment of agriculture is charged with
the duty of enforcing, established a
new- principle in American govern
ment, the principle of co-operation
between federal and state officers,
says Secretary of Agriculture Hous
ton. They are the only laws I recall
which recognize and insist upon this
(principle. They are therefore very
significant.
Heretofore federal and state offi
cers have too frequently looked at
one another across the line, some
times with apprehension as to what
the other was going to do or think,
sometimes with jealousy, not infre
quently with friction.
I need not emphasize the import
ance of good roads.
Most intelligent people who think
about good roads know that they are
essential to comfortable living, es
sential to proper community develop
ment, especially to the development
of rural life, to efficient production
Had orderly marketing of farm pro
ducts, to good schools, and to tha de
velopment of a satisfactory rural life.
Many people, however, do not ap
preciate this, and I have occasionally
met road officers who, when the lm-,
porta nee of good roads was empha
sized, have said:
'Yes, but they (est so muc.i.".
Apparently they have not thought
how much more bad roads cost, not
only In dollars and cents, but also In
all those indirect ways for w h'.cli one
can make no definite calculation.
This law appeals to me as of es
sential importance, not so much be
cause it carries with it out of the
federal treasury an appropriation of
$85,000,000, not because It will bo
met by an appropriation of $73,000,-
000 or more out of state funds, if
all the states accept the act, but be
cause as great as is the aggregate, it
is relatively insignificant In compari
son with the amounts the states are
now annually expending and will
spend during the period covered by
the act.
Huge Sums Spent
I remember that, on one occasion,
when I was speaking to a public offi
cial about the road bill and suggest
ed that we ought to begin with a
modest initial appropriation of three
four or five millions of dollars, he
expressed surprise and said that such
an amount would not get us any
where; that the expenditure by the
nation of a few millons of dollars
for roads would be merely trifling
with the matter.
I asked him if he knew what the
people of the nation were contribut
ing annually for road building, that
the nation was already expending the
equivalent of nearly half of what the
Panama canal has cost.
Of course he did not. And the ma
jority of the people do not realize
that the nation is expending approx
imately $250,000,000 a year for
roads. , - .
The main question that I made Im
mediately concerned with, that the
people of the nation are immediately
concerned with, is whether we shall
get a dollor's result for every dollar
we expend for roads.
Educational Campaign
I am quite sure that if we do so
and we can convince the people that
we have done so, they will be willing
to put much more money into good
roads where they are needed.
Therefore, the matter of adminis
tering this law, of devising good
road systems, of careful selection of
roads, of formulating projects, of de
veloping plans and specifications, of
having all matters considered on
their merit by competent men, seem
to me to lie at the root of this busi
ness. If, as the result of this act, the
people are Induced fully to realize
the necessity of placing skillfull and
experienced men in charge of road
building and road maintenance, a
great advance will have been made
and the efforts of those who labored
to secure the legislation will have
been rewarded.
Real Exerts Will Be Needed
I assume, as a matter of necessity,
that this law will require the em
ployment in every state of experts,
or real experts.
This word is very much misused
and abused.
The public is somewhat suspicious
of experts, because, I think, so many
people pose as experts who are not
I repeat that this act -will necessi
tate trained Intelligence in the ser
vice of the state as we!l as in the
service of the federal government.
The act requires the state to ac
cept It. That, as I understand it, im
plies the assent of the state to every
provision of the act.
Government Must Approve
One of these provisions is that pro
jects, plans, specifications and con-
tratcs shall be submitted and approv
ed ; and I have a suspicion that plans
and specifications will not be approv
ed unless they are submitted by peo
ple who know about such things
So the assent of the state involves
the calling of trained men into the
service of every state which is now
without them.
Guarding Efficiency
The law involves another thing
the pledge of the faith of the state
to meet in full the federal appro
priation for the entire period cover
ed by the act, but It can pledge the
faith of the state to meet the finan
cial provisions of the act for the
period covered by it.

east of shaft No. 1. It is the char- I
actenstic Groom lead ore, and had
been opened up to several feet on
Monday last.
The ore now going to market
comes from points in the vein from
100 to 400 feet south of the new

runs around 60 per cent lead, and 20

smelting charge.

UNCLE SAM'S SCHOOL
FOR FARMERS' WIVES
The biggest school In the world !s
the one which the government of tiie,,. .
United States is running for the ben- -efit
of the farmers' wives of this
country. Extending over hundreds of
thousands of square miles and hav
ing millions of students, the corres
pondent courses of the United States

ifmpt at any thing like real racing.
Dry Lake, by the speedometer is
1'?.5 miles from Goo.lsprings, just a I
little run down there and then j
spread out before the eye is a per
fectly level, hard-surfaced tract of
ground, five miles In width and about
eleven miles in length. It Is as
smooth and even as a billiarC table,
and the surface is as hard as finely
packed silt and alluvium can be
made. It is as dry as a bone during
the greatest part of the year. Oc

dozen cars, three or four miles off,
looked exactly like a herd of ele
phants walking over the desert. The
usual mirage accompaniment of run

plainly seen around - its edges and

Sues for Returu of Stock
educating the nation into better
methods of living, into improved fac
ilities for farming, into better ways
o buying and selling, and into high
er standards of work and recreation.
The school, which was opened us a
st-Mocl of information by the dvart
n.ent in 1914, and which has been
augmented by the provisions of the
Smith-Lever bill for agricultural edu
cation extension work, is one of the
most important and successful re
forms inaugurated by the Wilsou ad
ministration. Before its Inception
the farmers' wives of the United
States were dependent on the miscel
laneous and not always reliable
sources for their information con
cerning their activities. The depart
ment school has brought to them the
agricultural and household knowl
edge attained by the department and
; by the state colleges. The fact that
l the secretary and assistant secretary
I are, for the first time in the history
i of the department, trained econo
! mists has resulted in having the bus
j iness of farming recognized as a na
tional problem.
The department school has not
I o .ly taught the farmer hov to get
his rroduce to mar.t"t in order to
command the best prce, hut has 'le-
voted attention to the special mar
kets available for those farm pro
ducts recognized as the special activ
ity of the women on the farm. In
formation on poultry raising has
been spread everywhere throughout
the country, as has advice on dairy
products. Any woman who wants to
know better ways of farming in the
branches which she looks after need
only to write to the department of
agriculture. The accumulated knowl-
Ruth E. Lloyd, administratrix, and
Alexander Lloyd, administrator, of
the estate of William Lloyd, deceas-, edge of nearly four dozen colleges

against the Prince Consolidated Min
ing & Smelting company for the re
turn of 170,334 shares of Virginia-
Louise Mining company, the claim
being set forth that the stock was
held under option and that the op
tion had expired.
This is as it should be. It would
be unfortunate if it were otherwise.
It would be wasteful not to make
plans at the outset for the full period
covered by the act; it would mean
piece-meal road building and much
dissipation of effort and misdirection
of funds.
