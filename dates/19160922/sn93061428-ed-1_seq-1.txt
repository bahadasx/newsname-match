attendance was good, the weather wes
ideal, the smusemcnts kept the visit

Arteria lacks a suitable building of
sufficient capacity In which to con

were made In three buildings and

band concerts, ball games, recea

was another amusing feature of one
of the parades. ....
The livestock display Included about
150 animals: a creditaole display of
4 horses, mules. Jacks, catete and a
very fine display of hogs.
Greater intarest ia being taken i.
swine raising than in other animals
on account of the boys' pig clubs.
The winners of the prises In the var
ious communities where local contests
have been held were expected to bring
their priie pigs to this county fair
and contest f r the county prize un
der two classes the fst pig class and
the breeder class. There were rep
resented on this contest Ave register
ed hogs from Hope, one fat hog from
Loving, one fat hog and one register
ed from Otis. 2 fat and eight register
ed hogs from Artesia.
The following winners from the
breeding class, Clarence Fite of Hope,
first, and Robt. Pistole of Artesia, sec
ond, and R. A. Nymeyer of Loving,
Hlrat, and Henri Turpenlng of Artesia
aecond winners In the fat hog class
will Uke their pigs to Roswell and
also to the state fair at Albuquerque
to compete for the state prise.
As an evidence of the character of
the hog display. Manager Crjle of the
Roswell fair said he hardly expected
to see as fine as exhibit of hogs In
the state fair as we had here.
There wa healthy rivalry between
Holloman and Trotter, two hog en
thusiaets of our valley. Holloman won
over Trotter on the best boar over two
years old, but Trotter carried off the
most of the honors on all other ages.
Including the grand champion prise,
wnlch is only awrded to members of
the eastern New Mexico Swine breed
ers' association. .... ...
T The poultry exhibit Included 82
coops of 10 Aiforent breeds of chick
ens, turkeys and ducks. This ex
hibit waa msde by 26 different per
sona, including our merchante, law
vera, doctore as well aa our farmers
and the boys and girla of the poultry
clube. It was a fine display of birds.
Fred Knowbs won the grand cham
pion prise on a coop of reds.
The agricultural display made un
der the big tent, was a surprise to
the farmers. The long drouth which
was only broken about a month ago

. farmers aa weu aa wo awcamen w

Mhree different varieties o ffarm pro

'measured 27 inches in length and 86

first honors on general display and
liia awards included sixteen blue rib
tens, Mrs. Vtf Coll won first honors on
caaeesi fruit display en Jara of
fruit and 4 glasses of jellies.
Mr. L. B. Cecil for the C. A. P.
ranch, won all the hiño on apple
Jisplay with 32 boxes and 16 plates
including nine varieties. Most of the
apple crop waa lost thia season by
reason of just one lalte front without
smudging: I'-'OO worth of crude oil
and a little care made tho difference
between nothing and big crop of
apples on 40 acres. Mr. Cecil esti
mates his 40 acres will yolid a crop of
21 carloads and at present prices hey
should return 12,000.
The woman's department riiowed
the u-ual artistic skill of the women
and children in the display of flow
ers and needle work, cooking, etc. Es-
recial credit is due to the Happy
lour club of the Cottonwood district
for tho children! display. This club
has encouraged the young ladies and
the children by offering prizes during
the past year for the best exhibits of
industrial work. They have made a
very fine diaplay in which useful ar
ticles predominate, rather than beau
tiful fancy work.
The chidrens cooking and articlels
of clothing show remarkable training
considering the youthful age ( the
exhibitors.
The fair board ia making selections
from the different exhlbtte to out in
tho state fair display at Albuquer
que. Visitors from California and other
sections where they tse mu -h in the
growth of roses acknowledge that
they have no superior to the roses

roses are hardly comparable to them
in beauty and gragrance.

tell you it is some river and it was
up, and the farms were pretty much
under water and they had to plow
