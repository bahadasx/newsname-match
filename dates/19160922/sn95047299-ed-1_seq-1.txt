SOITJipiCERY
To Acquire Title to Edge
water Grove Alleges
Breach of Contract.
PRESIDENT LECKS
OF BOARD OF
E
Insists on Resigning Press
of Other Business, Reason
Given.
If what Billy Parker alleges in his
bill of complaint in a chancery suit to
compel the former owners to give him
title to Edgewater Grove is true, Bil-
ly nas been badly used.
But there is two sides to all court
cases, and The News has previously
given but the Rogers' side. Now
comes Billy with his.
The title of the suit is "Jeanie W.
Parker and Billy Parker, her husband,
vs. Charles H. Ingersoll and Harrison
W. Rogers and Martha H. Rogers, his
wife."
In his bill of complaint filed with
the clerk of the circuit court by his at
torneys, Swarengen & Guthrie of
Jacksonville, Billy sets up that he
bought Edgowater fcrove last June of
the late P. J. Becks, who vv.is tha
agent of Rogers. That he paid the
said Becks $300 down on the purchase
price, which was to be $2,800, subject
to a mortgage on the place of $4,000,
which mortgage he assumed. He al
so aloges that the said Becks tele
graphed the Rogers' of the sale and
that they approved it by telegraph,
which telegraph dispatch Billy's attor
ney's have in their possession.
Billy also claims that he was to pay
the balance of the purchase money in
two separate payments and that the
deed to the property, according to hi.3
contract with Mr. Becks, was to be
deposited in the Putnam National
Bank, the same to be turned over to
him when he had made the payments.
Also that he was given possession to
the property by Mr. Becks as agent
for Rogers and his wife, and that he
has been in constant possession and
has spent some $300 on improvements.
It is also alleged that the Rogers,
husband and wife, later entered into a
scheme to sell the property to Mr.
Chas. H. Ingersoll at an advance, ana
Tuesday evening little Clarice New-
niu..tfl ar nitf.b hirt.hdnv an-
-irersarv bv inviting several of her i that they never executed the deed to
little friends to a box party at the
Grand. After the pictures tney were
taken to the Grand ice cream parlor
where they were served, cream, cake
and candies. The small guests were
Maryjane Brown, Mary Belle Lane,
Mercedine Gallagher, Margaret and
Viola Benbow, Doris Causey, Mildred
Urie, Dorothy Coburn, Elizabeth Shel
ter, Evelyn 'Barnett, Emily Nerwich
ui Betty Hoist.
Palatka Without a Bakery.
With the giving up of the lease of
le Livingston bakery last week by
Mr. Sapp, the lessee, Palatka has
ten a week or ten days without a lo-
bakerv, and had it not been tnat
some of the stores handle foreign
made bread, there would have been a
ead famine in this city.
Here is an opening for some good
nan who thorougniy understands tne
baking business. Mr. T. R. Livings-
sin, long a popular baker here, nas
ten forced to give up the business
teause of failing health. Only a
month ago he leased the plant and
store to Mr. Sapp, who is a gooa
taker, but who is lacking in business
ability. He ran the plant some 15
lays and gave it up. For ten days
ike plant has been idle, the curtain3
are drawn at the store, and the yeast
las overflowed the bucket.
For several davs many people were
ii a quandrv as to where to get their
daily bread. Even the Lord doesn't
provide this necessary staple without
s oaner to act as intermediary, ana
Palatka was minus.
Matters have been adiusted some
what now and people are eating Jack
sonville made article, inferior to the
ld Palatka brand, but which will do
to save moiher from making hot bis
cuits for 'ireakfast.
If there is a hnlrpr in the country
wjio combines business horse sense
ith an ability to turn out a brand
?' the staff of life, there is an open
H in this city of Palatka, a city of
e 6.000 inhabitants, that will
Pfe him a fine living and permit the
yiW extravagance of an automobile,
otto T. Bond can tell you more about
him. but did execute a deed to Inger
soil, which same is now of record in
the office of the clerk of the circuit
court for Putnam county.
The News learns from reliable
sources that when Mr. Becks sold the
property he wired Mr. Rogers asking
what commission he would allow him
in case he sold the property, and that
it is the answer to this telegram
which the attorneys for Billy Parker
now hold.
On the other hand it is understood
that Mrs. Martha H. Rogers, in whose
name the purchase of the property
was made from Mr. Rix, claims that
she knew nothing of the sale of the
property to Parker, and that being
the rifhtful owner, she repudiated !t
when she was told what had been
done, and that neither her husband
nor anv one else had the right to
bargains to dispose of her property.
New Stationery Store.
The Palatka Stationery Company
will open a new trading center in this
city by October 1st or as soon there
after as the fixtures and stock can be
arranged. This company is to nave
the store in the Cochrane building at
the corner of Second and Reid streets,
which the 'Cochrane Company is re
modeling and putting in nrst-ciass or
der for retail store purposes. The
floor has been lowered to a level with
the sidewalk and a new front install
ed which will include immense plate
glass windows.
The new company will have an ele
gant store, modern in all its equip
ment, and will handle all kinds of
stationery, books and novelties such
is are uuallv found in book stores.
"With the opening of the new post
office this is going Eo be a most de
sirable location for a store of this
character and The News predicts that
the company will meet with success
from the start.
President H. F. Leeks of the Pa
latka Board of Trade sent in his res
ignation at this week's meeting of
that body. Mr. Leeks did notscek
the office, but rather took it under
protest. It was forced upon him.
He is a good-natured, if a busy man,
and he accepted the place. But his
own private enterprises together with
his position of responsibility at the
Wilson Cypress Company, so com
pletely fill his working hours, that he
was compelled to relinquish this de
partment of public work.
Naturally the members of the board
of trade are disappointed and filled
with regret.
Morris B. Cochrane is the first vice
president and he will act as president
until such time as Mr. Leeks' succes
sor is elected. Mr. uoenrane, nim
self, is possibly the most available
man for the position. He is young,
and has enthusiasm and ability; why
not?
Before resigning the presidency,
Mr. Leeks made up the standing com
mittees for the year as follows:

F. J. H. von Engelken of East Pa
latka who was recently appointed by
President Wilson to be Director of the
United States Mint, has been drafted
for political work in the west.
Mr. von Engelken is now in Denver
where the government has a branch
mint supervising the coinage of the
new preparedness dime. From Den
ver he will go to Kansas to make a
number of addresses in the democratic
campaign, and where his specialty will
be rural credits. He is to show those
Kansas farmers that it was a demo
cratic administration which first took
notice of the financial needs of the
farmer and placed him in a position
where he could get money independ
ent of the Wall street money trust.
This is a subject in which Mr von
Engelken is an acknowledged expert
and the administration is depending
much of his ability to make the rural
credits law clear to the western farm
ers. After Mr. von Engelken gets
through with his Kensas campaign he
is to go to Kansas City, Mo., to at
tend the meeting of the National Ban
kers' Association, which he has been
invited to address.
Mrs. von Engelken is still at her
home at Vingolf-on-the-St. Johns, but
is expecting to leave for Washington
about the first of the coming month.
That Knight & Wall Team.
The Knight & Wall baseball team
which called on Palatka last week and
wrested two games from the locals,
thereby doing something that no oth
er club has hitherto accomplished, re
turned to Tampa on Friday and told
the Tampa Times reporter of their
trip. The Times man puts it this
way:
"Rabbit" Bishop and eleven other
demons of the diamond returned to
Tampa this morning after walloping
Palatka yesterday as a final wind up
to successful two weeks tour. "Rab
bit" had nothing but praise for the
boys who accompanied him on the
trip and said every mother's son of
them acted like a gentleman and
what's more, they all played ball.
The youngsters who went off under
the Knight & Wall colors, showed
their speed on many a strange dia
mond and have returned with a chal
lenge to anything in the state. H.
Brown, Young and Schroeder com
prised tne pitcning Stan ana nung up
some records that won't be busted in
many a long day. Schroeder went
to work on the opponents at one af
ternoon session and struck out twenty-one
men, but the scorer lost track
iii the confusion and he was only
credited with twenty get that on
ly! In the course of their travels they
ran up against some of the strongest
ball players that have swept down on
Florida in many a day and among the
notables was Ferryman, an old Birm-
ingnam pitcner wno nas seiueu
Starke. "Lefty" George, a star of
the Jacksonville bunch, was also in
the Starke lineup and Pierce of the
Pixie league was among the twirlers
at Lake City. However, the Knight
& Wall mileage annihilators took 'em
as they came, and never faltered.
Thp following record of the trip
speaks for itself and shows what a
bunch of young huskies can do when
they make up their mind to it. The

VL rt. 'Secretary of the Board of
The latest word from Tallahassee
regarding the status of the Knott
Catts gubernatorial contest is to the
effect that Mr. Knott has been de
clared to be the Democratic nominee
by the State Board of Canvassers with
a net majority of 24 votes over Sid
ney J. Catts, and that Mr. Catts is
now continuing the contest by secur
ing from the supreme court an alter
native writ of mandamus to compel
the Alachua board of canvassers to
count the votes on governor from pre
cinct No. 3 of that county, and which
were omitted because of failure of the
precinct inspectors to sign the re
turns. In that precinct Mr. Catts
had a majority of 69 votes, and if
these be counted for him by order of
the Supreme Court, Catts will have
a majority of 35 votes and will be
entitled to the nomination unless
Mr. Knott further seek a recount in
other counties which might wipe out
the Catts majority.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday
issued a peremptory mandamus for
the State Canvassing Board to meet
on Thursday and re-canvass the vote.
On Wednesday although the court
granted petition of Sidney J. Catts
for alternative writ of mandamus re
turnable September 25, to compel the
Alachua county canvassing board to
count sixty-nine votes in precinct No.
3 for Mr. Catts as goveror, it denied
motion to stay the peremptory writ
against the state canvassing board to
canvass amended returns, consequent
ly W. V. Knott was on Thursday de
clared the nominee of the Democratic
party for governor of Florida.
From these proceedings it appears
that the tables are now turned, Mr.
Knott being declared the nominee and
Mr. Catts seeking the assistance of
the courts to correct alleged errors
and omissions of election officials, so
that a new declaration may be made
in his behalf.
It is evident that Mr. Catts cannot
say much more about "court nominee,"
fcr he himself is now seeking the aid
of the courts to get votes to which he
says he is entitled.
It was on Tuesday that things be
gan to happen in the Supreme Court
hearing.
Following a motion by Attorney
Adams council for Mr. Knott to strike
Madison county returns from the man
damus proceedings, the supreme court
handed down a peremptory writ to
the State canvassing board to convene
and recanvass the amended returns
in which Mr. Knott brought proceed
ings for a recount. This writ was re
turnable on Thursday.
In asking that Madison county be
omited from the proceedings Mr.
Knott made the following request:
"Hen. T. R. Adams, V. J. Oven, A.
B. and C. C. Small, C. D. Blackweli:
"Gentlemen: I have heard part of
the testimony with reference to the
testimony in Madison county and the
remainder you have reported to me
from time to time. In keeping with
the position I have at all times taken
in this matter, 1 wish to advise you
that I do not desire the benefit of any
ballots or votes that may have been
tampered with, or may be tainted by
fraud. Since there has been evidence
submitted by many substantial citi
zens of Madison county, which
may cast doubt upon the integrity of
the ballots as recounted from some of
the precincts in Madison county, I de
sire that you, at the proper time, ask
" ive of the court to amend my peti
tion and the alternative writ issued
against the state canvassing board so
as to eliminate my claim to any bene
fit of the recount, which was had in
that county. I make this request
without casting any reflections upon
the officers who had the custody of
the ballot boxes between the date of
the election and the date ot the re
Mr. Perry Ross, cashier of the East
Florida Savings & Trust Company in
this city received a telegram on Tues
day announcing the death at Hender-
sonville, N. C, on Monday or hia
grandmother, Mrs. W. V. Perry, relict
of the late Governor E. A. Perry, who
was governor of Florida from 1885
to 1889 inclusive.
Mrs. Perry had been making her
home during the past several years
with her children and grandchildren
She was about 80 years of age. Some
five or six years ago she spent the
winter in Palatka, and while here
made her home at Miss Mulholland's.
The remains were taken to Pensa
cola, Fla., for interment in the family
lot, accompanied by her daughter,
Mrs. F. P. Strong of Greenville, N.
C. Mr. Ross did not attend the fu
neral simply because of his inability
to reach Pensacola in time.
Mrs. Perry was a native of Ala
bama. During the years of her res
idence in Tallahassee and while her
distinguished husband served the
state as its chief executive, she dis
pensed a true southern hospitality and
was noted for her social functions,
given as first lady of Florida.
The late Dr. E. S. Crill of this
city was a close personal friend of
Gov. Perry, and during the four years
of the Perry administration served as
State treasurer. Because, of this Pa
latkans were frequently guests at the
Governor's mansion and were partak
ers of Mrs. Perry's gracious hospitali-
CATTS' STAR WITNESS
HELD i PERJURY
Sensation of Tuesday in Su
preme Court Mandamus
Case.
J. O. Barton, of Jasper, the star
Catts witness before the supreme
court, whose testimony had been look
ed forward to as a sensation, was
put on stand Monday afternoon and
swore that he saw W. S. Murrow, an
employe of Knott's office, formerly of
Jasper, on night of June 17 between
10 and 11 o'clock in clerk of court's
office with Clerk M. P. Hunter, tam
pering with ballots and a ballot box.
Two hours after giving this testi
mony Hunter and Murrow had Barton
arrested on perjury charge in Leon
county court.
Barton on Tuesday morning waived
preliminary examination and the casa
comes up in circuit court at TallahaS'
see November 27. Barton made a
five hundred dollar bond, four Jaspel
men going on it.
Murrow's counsel is now investiga
ting the advisability of having Milton
Smith, publisher of the Tallahassee
Daily Democrat arrested for criminal
libel' in nublishing a story and head
! lines this morning to the effect that a
Knott office employee tampered witn
ballots. Murrow in the presence of
a number of witnesses on Tuesday
called Smith a liar with adjectives and
feeling is high in the Capital city.
The supreme court is still examin
ing witnesses. Subsequent testimony
Monday had shown that Hunter and
Murrow were in the Hamilton coun
tv clerk's office checking up the
clerk's finance account, which is
Murrow's duty as an employee of the
comptrollers office, and other parties
were in the office with them during
the evening. What Barton thought
were ballots were adding machine
slips. There were no ballot boxes or
ballots in that room, they being in the
supervisor's office locked up.
