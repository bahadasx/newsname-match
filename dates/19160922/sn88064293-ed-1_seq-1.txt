Will My Funds
Be Safe?
That's the very first questoin that enters
your mind when you consider depositing
your money in a bank or making an in
vestment.
It is a very reasonable and logical question. Money
is hard to earn, and «till harder to save. You have a
right to DEMAND safety.
The affairs of this bank are under the supervision
of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United
States, and conducted by leading business men of this
cay.

The committee on m ilk u inspec

(lav or two and devise plan? for ac

One oi the topics particularly
discussed v. as the censorship of
moving pictures, a question that is
being agfcnted universally. A com
mittee was appointed to meet with
general committee oompri ung m. ; :
bers from all the different women's
organizations of the town. While the
league does not endorse autocratic
censorship system, it does believe
that, unclean, unwholesome and un
edueational pictures should be pro
hibited and that perfect order should
t-v i. .iintain *d i.iruig the production
of pictures. •.*, e of the practical

children should sit with their par
jents. The question was asked, "In
'case of fire how would parents reach
j their children?" Have you thought
of that mothers?
Mrs. M. D. Shannon offered her
j resignation as chairman of commit
' tee on sanitation. No action was
taken on this resignation as Mrs.
Shannon's services are too valuable
in that capacity to be considered.
In a few well chosen remarks, Mrs.
Storm emphasized the urgent need
of the members assuming individual
responsibility in promoting the vari
ous departments of work that come
under the Civic League.
The League appreciates the attd
bution of the Mayor in preparing the
council chamber for their meeting.
