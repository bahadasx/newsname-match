Halfway Good Point
Fred Gerberdlng, former Weston
Itt Who waa here thla weak, accom
panied by Mrs. Gerberdlng, from
v Halfway, Oregon, aays that section of
the state Is enjoying Its full share of
' Oregon prosperity. Located in una of
the richest valleys In Oregon, the
town of Halfway is constantly grow
lug and carpenters are in big demand.
A new school building was lately con
alructed at a cost of about 18.000.
It is three stories in Height, witn a
four teachers in its high school and
seven in the grades.
Crops are splendid throughout the
valley. Grain ia late, and is just a
s bout ready to thresh. Oats and bar
ky promise well. The hay crop waa
excellent Mr. Gerberdlng had 128
tona of timothy' and clover from 60
acrea of ground in one cutting, and
his neighbors were equally fortunate.
The near presence of a busy mining
district create a good market for all
produce.
Among Halfway'a entrpria are
two flourishing cheese factor!, each
of which rscalvee 8000 pound of milk
per day. It tarrest mercantile store
waa eatahllshed by a local stork com
pany almilar to that at Weston.
The body of Ruben Gaunt, Hoppnar
rancher who waa lost in the heavy
snow last winter, was found last wok
by a ehatpherder. An extended soarrh
was made at tha time of hie disap
pearance but without aucceM, and tha
dead man's brother remambere hav
ing passed within a few fact of where
the body waa found.
The Pendleton City Marshal des
troyed four gallons of whiskey and
two of alcohol found in an unclaimed
trunk at the railroad station. Judging
from the actvty of tha officials liquid
"enthusiasm" Is going to be high in
price and hard to find during Round
up. ,
LOUIS KOOGjNIN THE RACE.
The East end of the county, with
its large population, la asserting a
claim to representation in the Legisla
ture, and the friends of Louis Hodgen.
well known resident of that section ol
the county, have persuaded him f
consent to enter into the legislative
race on the Democratic ticket. Mr.
Hodgen will run for the place for
which J. R. Raley waa nominated but
refused to accept It la generally un
derstood that one of Mr. Relay's rea
jons for refusing to accept the nomi
nation waa the feeling of diUX ac
tion ia the East end of the county that
that portion of the county was not
.'airly repreented upon the legislative
ticket For tome time pat it has been
known that the peop!e of the East end
rf the county have felt diatifact:on
ver the fact that they had been give.v
no representation whatever on the leg
tiative tkket In former yare it w
ihe custom for one of the tepreenu
tivee to be selected frctn that region
and the East end people now feel that
t la only fair they ahould have a man
on the delegation. They have had i
representation during the last four oi
its yeara. ,
Mr. Hodgen la a competent and pop
ular man and haa resided in the East
jnd of the county practically all of hi
ife. lie has also many friends in
joth partiea around Athena and Ten
ileton, through the fact that he has
mgsgod in farming In these vicinities.
Por several years he was a pardner
with Judge J. W. Maloney in farming
.tear Pendleton. His "friends claim
Jiat his support will bo by no means
.onflned to his own party.
The list of candidates for the lower
house as now arranged will be as fol-
OWSt '
Republican nominees Roy W. Rit
.ier and J. A. Best, both of Pendleton.
Democratic nominee W. T. Reeve

The home of Mr. and Mrs. aJss
Tiordon in the Gherklng Flat neigh
borhood was totally destroyed Sun
day afternooo by fire during their ab
sence on a visit to Weston. They
wara notified of their misfortune by
phone and returned to find their dwel
ling place a heap of ashes. They had
nothing left but the clother on their
backs, and their loss is about $1000.
The house belonged to Sam Dixie,
now residing in Arliona, and the eon
tents only wera owned by the Gor

For running an automobile without

Main street fountain by Chief Wilson
and gave bail In Recorder Barnett'e
sourt for their appearance September
30. They gave their names as Frank

son. As the young men seemed t
be slightly "stewed" and objected ra
ther too strenuously to the holdlng-up
of their car, Chief Wilson searched
it also and found tventy-one quarts
of beer and one quart of whisky.

"SO HAVE WE."
CONVENIENT NEW DEVICE
FOR WESTON EXCHANGE
What is known as an"lntrruDtr,"
an automatic ringing device, haa Juat
been installed at tha Weston exchange
of the Pacific Telephone A Talegiaph
ompay. Now the operator la enabled
to ring up each patron by simply
touching a button, and is happily ap
orectative of the Improvement.
The Weaton exchange has enjoyed
a remarkable growth during the past
dva yeara under tha local management
of E. O. DeMoss, and and the service
is correspondingly good. Five years
ago there were only 25 patrons con-
n acted by phone with the exchange j
and just a lew years prior to mat
kime the ui'ire plant comlbtcd of just
two ub'trn, one at tha dfpot and the
other at an uptown hotel. This num
ber haa since grown to nearly 2D0,
and no lese than thirtoen farmers'
ines radiate from the We,. ton switch
board a do tha spokes from a bub.
in addition there ia a lui.g govern
ment line extending to thr ranjrer
Utiona on the Wenaha f oret reerv
xni also to Bingham Springs. Three
years ago a cable system was Install
ed by the company at a cost of $5000.
and would do credit to a town of ten
times Weston's population.
There is yet a "fly In the ointment"
however, and Manager Da Moa will
not rest content until he persuadoa his
superiors to remove it Weston needs
direct toil line into Pendleton, which
would obviate the present necessity
of calling intermediate points when
rendleton is wanted. Having such a
popular and growing exchange at
Weston, it la thought the company
will grant this additional boon now
that the need of it is becoming dally
more apparent
Contemplating the great conveni
ence of the Weston telephone eystem
as at present constituted, the Leader
man la prone to wonder how the peo
pie of this fortunate neighborhood
managed to get along when they had
to do all of their talking in one an
other's immediate proximity. Also
.t provides a safe and satisfactory way
for "us ourtlves" in telling Kernel
Boyd of the Athena Press just what
we think of him.
It's Already Boys
Last evening the big first prize
cowboy's bucking contest saddle was
finished at llamley s and put in the
window where all last evening and to
day it has been the center of much ob
servation. The saddle ia said to be
worth S350 and eclipses anything in
