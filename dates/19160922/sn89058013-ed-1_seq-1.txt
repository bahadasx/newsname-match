Everybody in Columbia, Tenn.,
Iknows F. 0 McGaveck, who owns
end operates a large dairy business
in thM.city.
"if there was ever a believer in
Tanlac," said It. M. 8 miser, the
Veil-known Columbia, Tenn., drug
gist, "it is Mr. McGavock, as he
talks about it all the time. But he
Las a right to talk, as no medicine
lias ever helped anyone as much as
Maniac has helped him. He really
does not look like the same man."
Here is Mr. McGavock's statement:
" "I have now taken five bottles of
tTanlac and have gained thirty
pounds. If you don't believe it,
aright here I am, come and look at
me. I don't know what my trouble
"Was but I was all run down and was
mnfit for work. I think, though, it
must have been my stomach, as I
iiad no appetite and nothing seem
ed to agree with me. 1 .just kept
- going down hill and losing weight
Tight along and nothing did me any
good until Smiser, the druggist,
told me about Tanlac.
1 tried it on his recommenda
tion and it helped me from the
tfirst few doses. The medicine
eeemed to take hold right at once,
end 'I began to eat better, sleep
tetter and feel better right from
'the start. .-If anybody wants to
'inow what'I think of Tanlac,; just
tell . to come' and see me. I am
light here in Columbia. Tanlac
lias simply made a new man of me
end I expect to tell all my: friends
-about what it has done in my case."
Referring to the above statement
G. F, Willis, Southern distributor
Tanlac, said:
"Tanlac is without exception the
greatest medicine of its kind on the
American market today. The ex
treme popularity of Tanlac can
only be accounted 'for by the ex
traordinary merit of the medicine.
The system, besides being purified,
Is toned tip and invigorated, as the
(preparation aside from i ts cleansing
the blood, revitalizes the constitu
tion, overcoming, as it quickly
eeems to do, nervousness, indiges
tion, non-assimilation of the food,
theadaches, dizziness and other
troubles that are so common.1'

We regret to chronicle the death
of Grover Stagner, son of William
Stagner, last Friday. 1 Grover was
a high-minded young man, just
entering his. 22nd year. His sad
and early demise reminds us that
the young are subject to death also;
that frequently,-just as it appears
like we are going to live on and on
for years, the withering winds of
death sweep over, our life and like
the . grass beneath the scorching
sun .we wither away j.-our physical
body returns to dust and our soul
goes out to meet the god who gave
it. We admonish his associates to
strive to emulate his life and live
it ove,r again in your life.

BREEDERS' ASSOCIATION
"I hope when I leave this world
I will go to a better one," is an ex
pression frequently made. Dear
reader, upon what is your hope for
this great inheritance founded?
Upon keeping the . moral? laws?
Being honest with your fellow man
and .'dealing - with him justly?
Abstaining from criminal habits?
Contributing to the church and to
charity? Keeping the sabbath?
Most assuredly you have no hope
unless you keep the moral law, and
you may be perfect in this respect,
and yet, as the Scriptures declare,
the law can not, justify you; it cau
not give you eternal life, but by
Jesus Christ, God's acceptable
sacrifice for sin, you can be justi
fied from all things; you can accept
Him as your own personal Savior,
be received into God's kingdom
and obtain an eternal inheritance
in Heaven, that better world.
Have you accepted Him as your
Savior, and are you now keeping
His commandments? Then you
have a sure hope; otherwise you
have no hope I care not what
you are from a moral standpoint.
He is man's only deliverer man's
only hope of eternal life (Saint
Johniii36.)
