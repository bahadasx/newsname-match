HAVE TRIAL HERE
New Idea in Threshing Rice Will Be
Tried lHere This Season..
Concerning 'he new idea in thresh
ing machines ,f ,,%:ch we have pre
viously had c·' raidl-Iale to say in
tilese co!umnl, .w, are pleased to
quote the f,,i',i, from an Enid,
Oklahoma. rnewy'l'ci'cr, first noting
that th:s machii( c if the invention of
MIr. Monroe Davis, brother of Mr. T.
L. Davis of Wel.,h, appeals to us as
peculiarly adaptcd to the rice fields:
There is a concei n making its mark
in Enid which has not had the degree
of publicity which it merits. That
concern i.' the, Ia'i Manufacturing
company which puit. out the New Da
vis Rotary Grain Slparator. The sep
arator is something in the line of farm
appliarnces which makes for saving of
time and expcnse. In this day and
age when efiiciency is the watch
word the farmer is as alert as the
business man to improve his methods
of doing bu.ir:ess.
Briefly dleocrilbed the Davis Rotary
Grain Separator i a machine for sep
arating the grain from the straw by
the rotary process, similar to that
used in the cream separators. The
main body of the machine is about six
teen feet in length and about nine
feet high. It has a feeder eight feet
in length, which carries the bundle of
headed grain to the separator by suc
tion thus doing :.;:ay with consider- '
able work in feeding the machine.
There are two blowers, one to expel '
the straw and the other to fan out
the chaff. The cylinder revolves at a
speed of from 950 to 1000 revolutions t
per minute. The rapid whirling of 
the grain threshes out the grain by c
centrifugal force rather than by beat
ing, as is done in other types of
threshers. The outfit weighs 2140
pounds, is all metal and fire-proof. It J
requires ten horse steam and fifteen
horse gasoline power to run.
Some 'of the little features that
recommend the new thresher may be n
briefly noted as follows: Does not h
crack the grain, can be set in three y
minutes, only two belts on the whole n
machine, only cight places to oil, r
grain can be threshed direct from the
header, does away with big threshing
crews and makes the farmer's wife
happy, threshes by centrigugal force
and is cheap enough for every farmer
to own. The price is $650.
The plant of the Davis Manufactur
ing company is located at Chestnut
nad Jefferson. The present equip
ment covers a floor space 60x120.
Sixteen men are employed. The of
fices are located on the third floor of
the Beck building.
The officers of the company are
J. T. Hinds of Elk City, president;
Monroe Davis of Enid, vice president;
George D. Wilson of Enid, secretary;
A. L. West of Enid, treasurer and
general manager; T. E. Forster of
Enid, superintendent of factory; C. L.
Sayles of Enid, general salesman.
Monroe Davis is the originator of the
idea and holds the patent on the ma
chine.
The company expects to turn out
1000 machines in the next year. The
separator can also be used in thresh
ing rice and next week the company
will ship a machine to the rice fields
of Louisiana.
CALCASIEU BRIDGE
OPENED TO TRAFFIC
The opening of the new bridge across
the Calcasieu river at Lake Charles
last Friday marks another long stride
in the progress of development of
Southwest Louisiana in which Calca
sieu parish is taking the lead.
The total length of the bridge is
1782 feet, the six arches are 96 feet
in the clear, twenty-nine viaduct
spans are each thirty feet in the
clear, the lift is 103 feet long and is
electrically operate d The bridge i
was built at a cost of $132,000.
It is reported that over six hundred
vehicles passed over the new bridge
the day it was opened to traffic. Com
pletion of the bridge will be officially i
celebrated when the Interstate Inland
Waterway League meets in Lake"C
Charles next month.

Threshing is general in all sections
of the Gulf Coast Rice Belt, and the
earliest of the Arkansas Honduras
will be threshed this week. As a rule
the rice in the DeWitt-Gillett section
is at least ten days earlier than in
the more northern sections of the Ar
kansas rice district, but such a differ
ence does not exist this year and
threshing at Stuttgart will start al
most as early as at Gillett.
About eighty per cent of the Hon
duras grown on the River and Techc
has been marketed, and the millers
will soon have to turn elsewhere for
fancy rices of this variety. Blue Rose
is being threshed end sold in nearly
every section of Louisiana and Texas
today, and the association minimum
of $3.25 is being well maintained.
The weather has been generally
favorable for the past four or five
days, although the rains of a week
or ten days ago interfered with cut
ting and threshing, and in some in
stances the grade has suffered.
The clean rice trade has been de
manding Blue Rose and there has been
a disposition on the part of the mill
erss to buy sparingly of Honduras.
Now that the great bulk of the River
and Teche Honduras has been mar
keted and milled, the millers of the
coast country will have to go into
other sections of Louisiana and Texas
for their supplies of Honduras. The
percentage of the rice area of south
west Louisiana and the state of Texas
planted to Honduras is only twenty
one per cent of the whole, whereas
sixty per cent of the planted acreage
in these seceions is Blue Rose. As
Blue Rose not only out-yields Hon
duras in the field, but mills about
thirty per cent more head rice, it is
evident that the better grades of
Honduras will be in demand during
the marketing season. There will be
lulls in the demand for Honduras
luring the first rush for Blue Rose,
gut in time the pendulum will swing
FIRST BIL'E ROSE
SOLI) LAST STAURDAY
First Sale of Blue Rose Rice at Crow.
Icy Brings $3.42 Per Barrel.
Crowley, La.--The first sale of blue
rose rice to be made on the Crowley
market this season was made Sat
urday by Manager F. M. Milliken of
'he Southern Rice Growers' associa
on and brought $3.42 per barrel.
Ihe rice weighed out over $4 per
ick. The lot consisted of 400 sacks
-ised by Joe Leonard on his farm
hree miles northeast of Crowley and
•s all No. 1 grade.
This sale is two weeks earlier than
he first sale of blue rose last year,
id the price is considerably better.
In all the Southern Rice Growers'
association sold 9219 bags of rice on
Friday, sales showing 6877 bags in
Louisiana and 2342 bags in Texas, the
crop being later in this state..
The first sale of blue rose last sea
son was not made until September
23. At Rayne Friday, Hines Smith
sold to the Lake Charles rice mill,
through the association, 450 sacks of
blue rose for $3.38. The rice was
classed green with a cupweight of 42
pounds.
Other sales indicating the tone of
the market, which is strong, were
listed as follows: At Louise, Texas,
to the Standard mills of Houston,
1200 bags of Honduras at $3.40; 982
bags of Carolina variety (Honduras)
at $3.80 f. o. b. New Orleans, the rice
being of high grade, river, grown by
Burgin brothers near New Roads, La.,
at Ferriday, La., 500 bags of Hondur
as at $3.50; at Welsh, 900 bags No. 2
Japan at $3.15.
The first sale at Beaumont of any
moment was also reported Saturdav,
being 350 bags of Honduras at Winnie
Jefferson county, at. $U5.
Weather over the coastal rice belt
is reported as fair. Harvesting and
threshing are increasing and this week
will doubtless see additional mills in
operation and an increased movement
of the crop from interior points.
back and Honduras will again be
sought after.
Foolish stories of the size of the
present rice crop have been circu
lated by ii.terests striving to bear the
market. It is true that we have a
big crop in sight, but it does not look
nearly as big as it did thirty days
ago. Thresher yields have not been
as large as anticipated. We had a
very small carry-over, and with the
excellent outlook for a continued ex
port demand, there is no good reason
why the crop should not move at the
values fixed by the Southern Rice
Growers' association.
The department of agriculture in
their report of September 1st, cut their
estimate of the crop, as shown by
their August report, 1,400,000 bushels
or about 305,000 sacks. Basing the,
probable production on the five year'
average for Honduras and Japan and
the average of the past two years on
Blue Rose would indicate a total pro
duction of less than 8,000,00 sacks.
Rice is retailing in England at a
cent a pound over prices prevailing
at the outbreak of the war, and the
British government has placed an
embargo on all rices stored in Eng
land.
The Southern Rice Growers' asso
ciation does not anticipate that
prices will range above what condi
tions justify, but they do anticipate
and will stand firmly for fair values.

SOMETHING DOING NOW
AT RICE GROWERS' OFFICE
Probably the busiest man in the
country these (lays is Mr. R. L. Ab
bott, manager of the local Southern
Rice Growers' office.
Nearly the entire crop in this sec
- tion is handled this year through the
f association and the farmers appreci
-ate the good offices of the association
to such an extent that the services of
r their local manager are in demand
constantly. They are beginning to
appreciate fully the futility of the old
-every man for himself-plan of mar
keting their product, and the result is
that the crop is moving rapidly but
steadily and with satisfaction to the
farniers as well as the mills.
Mr. Abbott is ably assisted in the
local office by his son and Mr. Riley.
Mr. Riley is himself well schooled in
the juggling of the Oriental cereal,
having entered his career in the rice
business in "The Rice City of Amer
ica" soon after he left the cradle.
The greatest feature of the 1916
rice crop is the beautiful weather
which is permitting the rapid harvest
of the crop and is responsible for the
fine condition in which it is arriving
at the mills and warehouses.
Blue Rose is king in this section
this year, and is probably sixty per
cent of the entire crop. It is mov
ing rapidly too, buyers competing for
every lot as it arrives from the
thresher.
BUYS FIRST RICE
OF NEW VARIETY r
Lake Charles American-Press:
The Lake Charles Rice Milling com- i
pany Tuesday bought the first lot of
Louisiana Pearl to be marketed this t
year. They secured from Jones and t
Malloy, at Welsh, 750 sacks of the rice a
of which 125 are in the warehouse a
here.
Louisiana Pearl is a new variety of
rice which is being tried out this year. e
As most of the crop will be held for g
seed it will not be a merchantable v
proposition this season. There is a f
good deal planted around Lake j
Charles, the best field being an 80- s
acre tract grown by Charles Links.
wiler, southeast of the city. Manager n
J. Alton Foster of the big rice mill, r
is enthusiastic over the rice, and de- tl
clares that it is the best grade he has n
yet seen. n
The Lake Charles Rice Milling tl
company yesterday bought 3,000 sacks in
of Blue Rose from Arthur T, Jones
and E. II. Boling at Welsh, paying
$3.30 to $3.25 a barrel. The associa- e
tion minimum is $3.25. B
LAKE CHARLES MILLS
ARE BUYING FREELY
Lake Charles American-Press:
Both the local rice mills are in opera
tion, and have been for some weeks
starting the season unusually early.
They are buying rice freely, and a
long run is anticipated. The big mill
of the Lake Charles Rice lilling
company, the largest in the rice belt,
will commence hnight operations by
Saturday, and. will thereafter run con
tinuously day and night through the
season.
Manager J. Alton Foster, of the big
mill, states t hat the report as to a
Crowley mill buying the first Blue
Rose of the season is incorrect. The
Lake Charles Rice Milling company
purchased the first Blue Rose this
year and last year, and also purchased
the first lot of Early Prolific this
year.
Last year the first sale of Blue
Rose was at Welsh on September 21,
when Shoemaker and Scroggins sold
to the Lake Charles Rice Milling cornm
pany 350 bags at 3.50 a barrel. This
year the big mill purchased the first
Blue Rose of the season at Rayne on
September 15, securing 500 bags from
H. Smith at $3.38. Yesterday the
mill purchased 2,000 bags of Blue
Rose at Rayne for $3.28.
The first large lot of Early Prolif
ic to be sold this season was bid in by
the Lake Charles Rice Milling com
pany at Welsh on August 25. It was
raised by Jones and Malloy, and the
225 sacks brought $3.35 a barrel.

SPECIAL MEETING HELD
BY POLICE JURY
The police jury met on Monday to
decide on a road from Hathaway
school house, ward three, to Elton.
Quite a number of people came before
the jury favoring different roads in
that direction. The jury then went
into executive session to decide on
a road that would accommodate the
most people in that community.
The road adopted by the jury runs
north two miles from Hathaway
sjchool house, ward three, west one
mile, north one mile and a half, west
one mile, north on China road to the
west side of the town of Elton, then
through Elton to east side of said
town.
The police jury received subscrip
tion bond to grade several miles of
road.
U. S. WILL GIVE LOUISIANA
$1,000,000 FOR GOOD ROADS
Good roads enthusiasts throughout
the state were keyed up to a high
pitch last week when Representative
J. W. Alexander of Rapides announc
ed his intention to actively push legis
lation for good roads on a big scale.
The country press from all sections
of the state commented on the ques
tion and the sentiment was over
whelming in favor of Mr. Alexander's
plan to make good roads legislation
the outstanding featrue of the next
regular session. That the public may
better understand the provisions of
the Shackleford-Bank'ead Good
Roads act passed by congress and
signed by President Wilson, President
P. M. Milner of the Louisiana Good
Roads association advises that the
amounts allotted to Louisiana are as
follows: First year, $67,950; second
year, $135,900; third year, $203,850;
fourth year, $271,900; fifth year,
$339,750; p4ofala $1,019,350. To me
ceive the benefit of this the state is
required to put up an equal amount
and is further required to guarantee
maintenance.
"It is for this reason," said M;r.
Alexander, "that it is imperative for
Louisiana to adopt a bill that will give
us an amount equal to and more than
that put up by the government, for
upon us is the obligation of mainten
ance. I intend to push this matter for
all it is worth and have assurances of
backing from all over the state.
Louisiana can and must be the
equal of any state in the union as to
good roads. Money spent in this way
will come back to us ten fold and the
farmers of the state will be brought
just so many miles nearer to their
;elling markets."
While Representative Alexander is
notoring to New York studying good
roads en route, President Milner of
he Louisiana Highway association is
notoring to Kentucky on a similar
nission. Both will be back within
hirty days when the good roads t
novement will be actively revived.

ROAD BOOSTESS
BWELL RECEIVED
After spending Sunday night in
Lake Charles the Texas and Lake
Charles delegation of Old Spanish
Trail, Trans-Continental Highway,
good roads boosters and enthusiasts,
arrived in Welsh Monday morning at
9:15, exactly on schedule.
Upon their arrival here they were
escorted directly to the auditorium,
where Mayor Wm. B. Gabbert spoke
the pleasing words of welcome in be
half of the citizens of Welsh, many
of whom were present to emphasize
the greeting.
Pleasing responses came from C.,
J. Kirk, of Houston; A. J. Splane, of Ated
Liberty; B. L. Turnbow, of Beaumont, `ime
(he "took in too much territory," but ,f
got away with it pretty well); H. L.
L'Hommedieu, of Orange; and D. M.
Foster and H. B. Bayliss of Lake
Charles. Some of the speakers ac
cused the others of stealing their
line of talk, but we don't think any of
them took any glory from Mr.
L'Hommedieu of Orange. He adhered
to the relative focts in a most inter
esting and original manner.
The party left here for Jennings,
their next stop, accompanied by a
