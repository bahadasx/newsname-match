BRAKEMAN MURDERED
NEAR WILNA
G. C. Stevenson, n well known
brakeman on the El Paso-Tucson
division of the Southern Pacific rail
road was instantly killed Monday
evening about 8:30 o'clock when ho
was shot in the throat by Mexicans
whom he acrosscd for riding in an
empty ore car at Ladim station, in
Grant county a short distance from
Wilna.
According to reports, Stevenson
was braking on the rear end of the
freight train and was stepping onto
an ore car from a refrigerator car
when four Mexicans who were riding
in the former, yelled at him to stop
and not come near them. Stevenson,
with a sense of duty leaped into the
car and was instantly shot by one of
the men, the bullet entering his neck
and penetrating into his spine, death
coining instantly.
The front brakeman hearing th"
revolver shots rushed to the scene and
shot at the cMxicans a3 they leaped
from the moving train.
The body of Mr. Stevenson was
taken into Doming and word sent to
both Lordsburg and Separ of the af
fnir. Posses were organized at all
places along the line and a thorough
search made of the country in and
around Wilna and Ladim.
George Stephenson was well known
here having been employed by tho
Southern Pacific company for about
four years. He and his wife lived in
El Paso, Texas. Tho tragic killing of
the man, who was liked by all who
knew him, cast a general feeling o"
depression over the railroad boys and
his many friends here.
Jose Murillo, Romulo Martinez
and Paul Carillo were brought
here Wednesday night by sherifl'
H. J. McGrath and confined in
the jail as the alleged murderers.
Murillo and Martinez were ar
rested at Gage, and Carillo at
Separ. Another Mexican is being
sought. They will have a hear
ing about Saturday.
I GOOD BYE BOYS
I Two of Lordsburg's popular young
, men are leaving the ranks of bach
I clorship and are launching; yea even
lunching, on the hopes of matrimon
ial sailing. With tears in their cyea
tho old pals arc singing that well
known hymn "Good Bye Boys". They
are chewing their last gum, smoking
their last cubeb, drinking their last
cocoa-cola. Tho pathos is heart
breaking sniff, sniff. Only a week
less than a month stands between
them and eternity. With tears in our
eyes tho Liberal chronicles these
coming oventa. Good Bye Bovs!
