As thrilling as the melodrama
in which the heroine is jerked

A ghost story is being reoalledj
uy elderly residents ot stone
oounty, since the death of one of
the principals In the episode. As
the story goes, a parly of young
people had gone to a dance in
Stone county one Christmas
night, when early in the morning,
on the return home, thore ap
peared in front of them two men,
both on horses, coming at break
neck speed, but the hoofs of their
horses did not clatter on the fro
zen ground. The driver of the
wagon reined iu his horses to
give them the' roaJ, when they
separated, passing the wagon on
each side, and as they swished
by it was noticed neither had a
head. One of the young women
fainted and for several months

The county court has a propo
sition up for consideration in the
nature of a bond Nana whereby

be paid. It is the desire of the
court to get this matter before
the people at once, so that it
cau be voted on at the general
election In November, thus avoid
ing the expense , of a separate
election. By making' a- rpecial
effort the court feels sore that a
bond'istiue oan be floxied1 on a'

New C01T4 And Iog Cholera.
Hog often take eholera soon
after being put on a ration of new
corn,, and its use is often con
denied on this aooount. New
corn alone is not the causeof hog
cholera, but it may be a factor,
along with other conditions, that
helps weaken the vitality and
renders the animal less resistant
to disease. In order that new
corn may bo fed with safety, the
animals should be put in a heal
thv. viccrous oondilion before
lime to begin feeding.
When the animals are In a
thrifty growing oondilion, there
should be much less danger but
the herd should be gotten on full
feed gradually. It is well to give
them about a stalk ofoorn per
ling the first day, gradually in
creasing it by one stalk a head
every oilier day so that it is get
ting two stalks the third day,
three stalks the fifth day, and so
on until they are on full feed.
This gives the stomach time to
adjust itself to the new ration
and is a specially goo j thing 10
do before turning old hogs into
the field to hog down oorn. It is
less necessary in .case of the
shoals whioh are not so likely lo
overfeed because they do not
have the weight and experience
whioh enable them to break down
the stalks very rapidly. E. R.

Changing Breeds or Chang
ing Feeds.
In traveling over the country
we often fiad poultry breeders
who are continually changing
from one breed to another, and
in the same way we find men
changing from one feed or sys
tem of feeding to another. Nei
ther seems to make very muoh
progress.
The first man seems to think
that all depends upon the breed
or variety and when one breed
fairs for him, lie sells the stock
he has, buys a new start and be
gins all over again, but follows
the same old system of feeding'
and care which failed before, and
as a result, in two or three years,
is ready to sell out and try some
other breed.
The second man thinks it is all
in feeding and tries everything'
he hears of in the form of poultry
food, not staying with one feed
or system of feeding long enough
to get definite results.
The faots are that neither
breeding ncr feeding alone will
suooeed, but proper feeding will
bring good results.
Of the many lessons learned in
the Egg Laying Contests con
ducted at this Station, the two
which stand out Very prominen
tly are that there is no "best"
breed and no "best" feed. Al
most every breed and variety
oan point with pride to some win
ning made in the contest. This
leads us to believe that there is
more in the breeding than there
is in the breed or variety, and
that strain tells more than either.
In other words, we believe that it
is possible through bleeding lo
produoe either high or low eug'
orodeoers.

The proper solution of this pro
blem is for every poultry raiser
to select the variety he likes best
and is best suited to his condi
tions, and improve his flock by
selecting breeding stock and
work nut a system of feeding
whioh is the most practical, us
Inn as a bnee for the ration the
feed which is the cheapest and
easiest obtained, and purchasing
onfv such feeds as are needed to
produoe a balance.
