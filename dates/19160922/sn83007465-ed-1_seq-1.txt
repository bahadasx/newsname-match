BANKING SYSTEM
NEEDJF MEXICO
COMMISSION AT WORK
Will Try to Arrange for Comprehensive
Scheme to Restore
Nation's Finances.
New London, Conn.., Sept. 19.?
A plan for a Mexican national bankIn#
system to take the place of the
suspended national bank and the
Bank of London and Mexico, in Mexico
City, was outlined to the American
members of the joint MexicanAmerican
commission ha?-e by Luis
Cabrera, chairman of the Mexican
members.
Mr. Cabrera explained that a monetary
commission has heon rro#t?r
that will have supervision of a chain
of government banks and 1t is hoped
to obtain financial backing, chiefly
from Mexican sources, to support the
scheme.
This explanation was given after
the American members had asked to
be enlightened on the order suspending
the two Institutions. Mr. Cnrern
said the two banks had issued bank
notes far in excess of their metallic
reserve, and recently had refused to
sell to the government exchange on
foreign banks at rates demanded by
the government. The institution had
been Ordered to show a metallic reserve
equivalent to their issue of paper
money, he said.
Mr. Cabrera added that the step
"was largely retalitory as the banks
of Mexico, chiefly the two in question,
were responsible for depreciation of
Carranza currency.
Following is the official statement
Issued by the commission:
"On account of the publication this
morning of the fact that two of the
banks in Mexico City had been closed,
the Ameican commissioners expressed
their desire for information
upon this matter. The information
was given by the Mexican commissioners
that this was the result of a
policy which the Carranza government
felt had been carried on by cer
miu ui mif mencan nanus 10 depreciate
the government currency, that
these banks were, in fact, the money
trust of Mexico and the government
was anxious to make these
banks more loyal to the purposes for
which they were instituted. These
banks, it was said, were the chief
agencies used for the depression of
the paper currency and this was hostile
to the welfare of the country.
The government of Mexico is Just
contemplating, when these banks
close permanently the establishment
of a national banking system similar
to that in the United States, the
foundation for which already exists
laa monetary commission."
?The border situation was discussed
by the commissioners in a casual way,
but without much progress toward an
agreement.
William Phillips, assistant secretary
of state, conferred here today
with the American representatives
on his way back to Washington from
a vacation. Counselor Polk of the
state department is expected here tomorrow.
American and Mexican members of
the commission made a trip this afternoon
in a K type United States
submarine. The craft was submerged
for several minutes during the brief
cruise. It was the first time the
Mexican commissioners had been in
a submarine.

MORRISON CALLS
COTTON FARMERS
WILL UPHOLD PRICE
Rapid Ginning and Selling Depress
Market?Meeting in
Columbia September 28.
Columbia, Sept. 18.?A cotton
holding movement will be launched'
at a meeting of farmers to be heldin
Columbia September 28. The
r*n 11 *
..... ,v?. uic lumerence was Issuedyesterday
from McClellanvllle by H.
T. Morrison, president of the SouthCarolina
State Farmers' union.
The following Is the call whichwas
Issued to "the cotton farmers of
South Carolina:"
"At a meeting of the State presidents
of the Farmers' union held in
New Orleans. In*., September 5 and
6. a resolution was passed urging
upon the cotton planters of the South
the importance of holding meetings
in their respective States for the pur- <
pose of organizing a cotton holding
movement.
"While the price was apparently
high on the first of September, the
rapid ginning and selling of cotton
are already depressing the market, .
almost twice as much cotton having
been ginned as was last year at this
time. The buyers are naturally taking
advantage of this fact and unless
we can check up the selling the
price will go still lower.
"Reports show a very short crop
and probably not more than 11,000.000
bales and when all remember
that two years ago. under war
conditions, a 16.000.000 bale crop
was consumed we can appreciate
where cotton will probably go to if
slowly marketed.
"Harbin's report gives only 58.7
per cent of a crop for this year, with
South Carolina at 48.2 per cent
(about half of a crop which as far as
my personal knowledge goes Is
about true.)
"Somebody is going to sell cotton
before the next crop comes in at 20
cents and up. and why not the man
who makes? With our State warebouses.
money at a low rate of interest
and cheap storage and Insurance,
there should be no reason for the
majority of the farmers of this State
to depress'the mrket by selling now.
In 1914 we made a big crop but got
nothing for It : in 1915 the nrice wa*
fair but the crop short. The 1916
crop will probably he the shortest
we have had in ten years and the
world may be facing a cotton famine.
Why not the producer reap the
harvest? To do this we must act together,
unorganized we can never
bhll the mrket.
"You remember that two years ng</>
when the Southern farmers askecf
congress to pass an act opening up
the ports of the warring countries to
their cotton they were told that congress
was a slow working and conservative
body and that nothing
could be done in time to save that
crop even if it bankrupt the entire
South. But when organized labor,
4 06.000 strong, threatened the country
with a general railroad strike.
President Wilson discovered that
congress was not as slow and conservative
a body as he thought it was
and the eight hour law was passed
in less than that many days. Whether
this was right or wrong we are now
discussing, but it proves very clearly
that if the farmer wants anything
he has got to go after it and he organ
ized well enough to demand it.
"To start this cotton holding
movement I have been requested to
call a meeting in Columbia, Thursday.
September 28. at 3 o'clock p.
m. This I will do if farmers are Interested
enough to attend such a
meeting or will join in the holdingmovement
and will so Indicate bywriting
me a card."
