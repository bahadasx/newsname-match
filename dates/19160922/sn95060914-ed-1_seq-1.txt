Working for the
Republican Party
Mrs St Claire Thompson and
Miss Helen Todd representatives
of the Congressional Union held
a meeting Wednesdaynight at
the Baptist Church and completed
the organization of the Safford
Union
These ladies for some reason
best known to themselves seem
to be possessed of the idea that
the way to secure equal rights
for women is to do everything
they can to defeat President Wil
son Senator Ashurst and Con
gressman Hayden at the same
time they must know that the
National American Woman Suf
frage Association the real and
bona fide workers for suffrage
at its annual convention held re
cently at Atlantic City N J
decided that it was not the square
thing to work against President
Wilson whom they know to be
their friend and who voted for
equal rights for women in order
to elect the republican candidate
Hughes who never was in favor
of woman suffrage until he be
came a candidate for president
The National American Woman
Suffrage Association which has
been existence for fifty years
must not be considered as in any
way backing up the Congres
sional Union which appears to
be organized in the interest of
the republican party to defeat
democratic candidates for office
The National American Woman
Suffrage Association convention
decided unanimously to continue
the work to secure equal rights I
through non partisan effort and
not through any political party
The women of Safford and Gra
ham county would do well to fol
low the advice of the real wom
ans suffrage organization and
not that of a political adjunct of
their old enemy the republican
party which sends its emissaries
here to secure votes for republi
can candidates

Statement by
R F McBride
In view of the fact that there
has been so much said about a
frame up which is said to
have existed between myself and
Frank Richardson during the
recent primary election by which
Mr Richardson it is alleged was
to receive the position as deputy
sheriff or 50000 in case I was
successful at the polls I feel it
my duty now that the primary
is over and I was successful to
put the plain truth before the
people
I want to state plainly and em
phatically that I have not di
rectly or indirectly through any
means whatever promised Mr
Richardson any v position or re
ward of any nature and I want
to say further that I had nothing
to do with him becoming a can
didate and am jiot responsible
for it in any way
I suppose he was prompted by
the thought thatrhe could win I
hrmly believe mat ne naa no
other motive and I should not
have been ashamed to have been
defeated by such an estimable
jrentleman
I hope this statement will be
sufficient to put us both right be
fore the people If there is any
one who feels frtclined to dis
credit this statement I know
that Mr Richardson will cor
roborate me although I have not
consulted him in the matter but
as I am stating a truth I have
no fear of contradiction
I feel it my duty to my friends
who supported me so loyally in
the face of such false accusations
to put the plain facts before the
voters to whom I must look for
support in the coming election
I want also to say that I have
pursued the policy of keeping
free from all promises of sup
port The few small appoint
ments that the sheriff has to
make have not been promised
and will not be promised by me
so that if I am successful at the
election I will not be tied up
with any such obligations
In conclusion I wish to thank
my many friends for their loyal
support and 1 wish to assure
It is times like these when we
are made to realize our depend
ence upon our friends but while
I am louo in my praise and thanks
to my friends I do not wish to
criticise those who saw fit to sup
port either of the other candi
dates for they are both worthy
men and the splendid majority
each received in his own precinct
stands out as a monument to
their honor and shows that they
are most respected where they
are best known
I consider it a great honor to
be the choice over such splendid
men and I hope I may never
cause the voters of this county
to regret that they chose me as
their candidate for the office of
sheriff
Sincerely
R F McBride
