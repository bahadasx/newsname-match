SHALL WE HAVE II CORRAL
FOR A POSTOFFICE. OR
CORRAL A POSTOFFICE
Postmaster Jas. L. Byrnes received
a telegram yesterday from Port Office
Inspector Jarvls, dated at Douglas, in
which the inspector desires to meet all
those interested in a new post office
building for Flagstaff. Ho says he
will be in Flagstaff Saturday (tomor
row) for the purpose of looking into
the matter.
The people know what they have in
the way of a post office building and
conveniences.
The people know that they have
been paying for what they do not get
reasonable conditions.
The people realize that the only
way for them to get what they pay
for, is to put the proposition squarely
up to some inspector. If he can't
remedy matters it is up to the people
to hold a mass meeting and sec if
there isn't some od who is capable of
handling the matter.
Senator Ashurst is in town what
can he, or will ho attempt to do ?
Would he stand in line for his
mall?
Would he take a half day off in en
deavoring to buy his two bits worth of
stamps?
If we can't get what wo pay for
or put in time trying to pay for, what
is the use of a post office?
So far as Flagstaff is concerned, it
is not a political proposition, but a
business proposition.
Ashurst, Smith and Hayden have all
"introduced bills," but where do wo
get off at?
Congress spent over two billions of
dollars where is ours?
Flagstaff is paying more than her
pro rara sharo of the freight and
can't get decent service.
Some politicians want to take over
the railroads of the United States.
If the United States can not handle
with ordinary decency the business
they now have on hand, what in er
Yuma, could they do with the rail
roads ? .w
'The people of Flagstaff should turn
out en mass and ask to inquire of the
inspector, Senator Ashurst, Congress
man Hayden et aL, just where they
were at when the other appropriations
were made for cross roads towns back
cast.

as the "Shultz place" located one and
a half miles north of the city was
recently purchased by George Bab
bitt, J. H. Grceno and R. C. Taylor,

The location is an excellent one
with plenty of ground to golf, build
reservoirs for fish and swimming and
a splendid skating pond during the
winter months.

REPUBLICANS OPEN
CAMPAIGN HERE OCT. 3RD
The republicans will open their cam
paign in Flagstaff on October 3rd,
with Judge Kibbey, candidate for U.S.
senator; Jos. Prochaska, candidate for
secretary of state; Judge Baughn,
candidate for supreme judge, and N.
J. McKenzie, candidate for state mine
inspector. Judge Kibbey is a good
logical talker and will present the re
publican side of the case forcefully.
The other candidates will present
their case to the people and advise
them why they should be elected this
fall.
The state central committee also ad
vises that Tom Campbell and party
will arrive in Flagstaff on October
24th for a grand rally of republicans.
The general itinerary for the re
publican candidates and speakers of
national repute, has not as yet been
given- out by the state committee, but
it is expected that they will soon have
the state covered and dated with one
of the most enthusiastic campaigns
that was ever started in the state.
The republicans of the state are
alive to the situation all over the
country, and there is evidence in
every direction that an old time Mc
Kinlcy landslide is coming this fall,
regardless of the attempts of the
democrats to stem the oncoming del
uge. President Wilson's famous
dance "two steps 'forward, three
steps backward, hesitate and side
step," has gained , him no friends
among the average voters, of the
Southwest They are singing the
song of: "He kept us out of war and
got us in debt; he soaked our patriot
ism and lost on every bet"

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
HANLEY WILL STOP HERE
NEXT MONDAY MORNING
Frank J. Hanley, the prohibition
candidate for president of the United
States, will be in Flagstaff next Mon
day morning at 6:30 with his special
train of two private cars. Mr. Han
ley and his party of prohibition work
ers will be in Flagstaff until 8 a. m.,"
leaving for the east at that time.
We have heard of no special ar
rangements for meeting -the distin
guished party, but presume that some
later notice will be given, and that
some meeting of the prohibition party
adherents will be made to receive the
visiting guests and gather a crowd to
hear the speakers of the party.
The special train will leave for a
round trip through Denver, Colorado,
then through Nebraska and east to
the starting point
Later: Arrangements have been
made for Gov. Hanley to speak in the
Empress theater at 7 a. m. It is an
early hour, but the best that could be
secured under the circumstances. 1
Is Investigating Coconino
Water Company's Plant
Mr. 1 J. Trping, of Chicago, ar
rived in Flagstaff Wednesday to go
over the Coconino Water Company's
water project at Crater Lake, where
they have a big lake of water and
other natural water reservoirs con
nected in chains for the development
of the country north as well as water
to sell all along the line of the Santa
Fc.
Mr. Truing is interested in financ
ing and further developing the water
project, and he expects his engineer
in Flagstaff from the east within a
few -days to go over the system thor
oughly. So far as the work of the Coconino ;
Water Company has proceeded, there
is every evidence that the water de
velopmentscheme is a valuable one,
and those who have gone over it are
enthusiastic in their opinion as to its'
value.
TADDYTIN KILLING
CASE STARTED YESTERDAY
Although their case had been set
for yesterday, it was found impossi
ble during the day to start the trial
in the federal court of E. Nash, Ash
ley Wilson and D. M. Robertson, in

fort to convict some one.

good ribs broken in an auto accident
last Friday night just east of Flag

turning over. Galleger was caught
under the machine, Tom Richardson

three Mexicans who were arrested
here last spring after a lively gun
fight, and who were wanted for rob
bing cars, were convicted at Prescott
Wednesday of ti' crime charged
against them in the federal court
Dominguez,- ,who was arrested at the
same time on the same charge, was
acquitted.
Shriff W. G. Dickinson, son Carl,
Deputies F. L. Dickinson, Frank Fair
child, Tom Eakins and Charles Mur
ray, who was a deputy at the time of
the arrest, were in Prescott the past
week attending the federal court as
witnesses in the case.
There was conclusive evidence that
the men were the guilty parties, and
their arrest brought a stop to the
many freight car robberies that had
been going on for six months pre
vious. Quantities of all sorts of freight
were captured, including everything
from silk shirts to carpet cleaners.
The gang seemed well organized, and
were energetic in holding up every
