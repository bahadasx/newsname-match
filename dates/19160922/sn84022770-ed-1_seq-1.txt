MIUI GUARD
HOT POLICE MCE
ONLY WHEN CIVIL AUTHORITIES
KAIL WILL HE CALL MILITIA,
SAYS GOVERNOR.
Declarations that as long as he is
governor the National Guard of the
state would not be used "as a police
force subject to call at every viola
tion of the laws of the state in con
nection with labor or other troubles,"
featured the address delivered by
Governor Lister ast Sunday after
noon, when as commander-in-chief
he officially reviewed the Second
Washington Infantry, encamped at
American Lake. Several thousand
persons were present, many of them
relatives of the members of the
Guard, and in the opinion of all those
who witnessed the parade, no regi
ment of regular soldiers ever made a
better showing in review than did the
Washington boys.
Governor Lister's address was de
livered after tho review and in it he
congratulated the officers and men
upon the fine showing made. In part
he said:
"While I am governor of Wash
ington and commander-in-chief of the
National Guard of the state, I do not
propose that the National Guard
shall be used as a police force, sub
ject to call at every slight violation
of the laws of the state in connection
with labor or other troubles that
may occur. The proper handling of
such conditions is clearly the duty of
the civil authorities —of the police
departments of the cities and the
sheriffs' offices of the various coun
ties.
"Should a condition arise, how
ever, where the protection of life and
property has clearly gotten beyond
the control of the civil authorities, I
would then feel it to be my duty to
use every power at my command to
quell the disturbance, and am sure I
would receive a ready response from
the officers and men of the National
Guard, should they then be called
upon for service. Should such a con
dition arise, every member of the
Guard would know that they were
being called upon only as a last re
sort."
A spontaneous expression of ap
proval of the sentiment voiced by the
governor came from the members of
the National Guard and also the vis
itors assembled. The weather condi
tions were ideal for the exercises and
Governor Lister could be heard in all
parts of the large parade ground.

MAIL SERVICE EARLIER.
First Now Received in 'Time fop
Morning Delivery In City.
Olympia's first mail is now received
at 6 o'clock every morning, being
brought to the city from St. Clair by
auto stage, replacing the service for
merly given by the Union Pacific on
its morning freight train, which
reached the city about 9 o'clock.
Elmer C. Tew, local dealer in Max
well and Hudson Super-Six automo
biles, has the new contract.
Before the Union Pacific entered
the local field, Olympia's first mail
was not received until 10:15, being
distributed in the boxes about noon
and delivered in the afternoon. The
Union Pacific service gave postal box
patrons their mail about 10 o'clock,
and the new auto stage service not

on the rural routes the same day as
received.
TURNER ADVOCATES
TARIFF ON LUMBER
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR
UNITED STATES SENATOR
TELLS HIS VIEWS.
Former United States Senator
George Turner of Spokane, Demo
cratic candidate for United States
senator in opposition to Senator Miles
Poindexter, in Seattle Tuesday an
nounced himself in favor of a revi
sion of the Underwood tariff to the
extent that Washington industries
and products should be protected,
among them lumber, shingles, coal,
horticultural and agricultural and
dairy and poultry products.
In his statement Senator Turner
does not concede the need of a gen
eral revision of the Underwood tariff
law, in fact, he frankly says that in
dealing with manufactures generally
the law needs no revision.
"The schedules are not too low," he
says, and adds, "but, based as it was
on the Democratic platform declara
tion, the law ought not to have over
looked the industries of the state of
Washington. They were as much en
titled to be cared for as those of Mas
sachusetts or Pennsylvania. In mak
ing this declaration I have in mind
specifically lumber, shingles, coal,
horticultural and agricultural prod
ucts."
Senator Turner produced corre
spondence which passed between him
self and Donald Mclnnls, chairman of
the legislative committee of the
Washington State Dairymen's asso
ciation, and written before the rfccent
primary election, in which he de
clared himself unequivocally for a re
vision of the Underwood tariff law to
include the restoration of a protective
tariff on the products of the Pacific
coast in general and Washington in
particular.
"The political complexion of the
senate cannot be changed within the
next four years," Mr. Turner pointed
out, "and a Democratic senator can
be more effective in securing the nec
essary changes in our tariff laws than
a member of the opposite party. I
have that advantage over Senator
Poindexter."
Rev. D. A. Thompson Resigns.
Rev. D. A. Thompson, pastor of the
local Presbyterian church for the last
Ave years and one of the active men
of the city, announced to his congre
gation Sunday that when the Olym
pia Presbytery meets at Kapousin
next Tuesday and Wednesday he
mould tender his formal resignation
from the local pastorate. Since living
In Olympia Rev. Mr. Thompson has
been a member of the city library
board most of the time, and is presi
dent of the Associated Charities and
the Ministerial association. At the

tian Endeavor society he uas elected
a world's vice president.
Tebhetts Freed of Arson Charge.
After a trial which lasted several
days, a jury in the Pierce county su
perior court late Wednesday brought
in a verdict of not guilty in the trial
of M. C. Tebbetts, proprietor of the
co-operative stores operated as M. C.

TRY OLYMPIA MERCHANTS FIRST
HEW TO THE LINE; LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY."
OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1916
GOSSIP Of IDE POLITICAL CLANS
HIST! THERE'S A ROW ON.
j Conflicting claims by rival factions
tin the ranks of Thurston county Re
i publicans as to control of the county
'central committee, composed of the
! precinct committeemen elected at the
: recent primaries, gives promises of a
| lively session of that committee when
j it meets in this city Saturday after
i noon to perfect its formal organiza
tion as required by law.
After the first rush of the primary
had passed by, the spokesman for the
organization, headed by State Com
mitteeman W. W. Hopkins of the
state land commissioner's office, flam
boyantly spread the news forth that
I they had retained control of the
| county committee, meaning thereby
j that Hopkins would be re-elected
j state committeeman and that Ed San-
I ford might again be allowed to call
| himself county chairman.
1 But then by and by the informa
tion leaked out from the other side,
I captained by L. L. Bowers, former
j deputy sealer of weights and meas
i ures for this county but relieved of
| that responsibility some months ago
by County Auditor Annie Gaston, and
.1. P. Thacker, one time Local Repub
lican "boss" and in his influential
days Sam Perkins' right hand man,
that the Hopkins machine didn't have
all it claimed to have and that all the
signs portended a considerable revo
lution in the management of the
county central committee and the per
sonnel of the state committeeman and
county chairman.
But the chief of the Hopkins lieur
tenants, comes forth now with the as
sertion that "L. L. Bowers isn't going
to be county chairman or Ted Mc-
Lafferty state committeeman," which
is Just that individual's way of saying
that the Hopkins crowd had again
garnered unto themselves the control
of the county committee.
There are a tew of the committee
men who aren't "pegged" yet. Some
of these gathered together the other
afternoon but failed to reach any
common status quo, and the maneu
vering of the intervening days appears
not to have settled things smoothly
and quietly. So, barring of course all
eleventh-hour compromises, settle
ments and agreements, the commit
tee's session promises to provide some
interesting and perhaps some exciting
and upsetting entertainment Satur-'
day.
The upshot of it may be that the
two factions will agree on a compro
mise candidate such as Joe Peters or
George Draham, eliminating both
Hopkins and Bowers and setting as
clear a satl can for the county
campaign this fall- For there are not
a few of them, especially among the
candidates, who would like to escape
the odium of being called "Hopkins'
candidates" if they could and are
even now muttering among them
selves the advisability of "ditching"
Hopkins and taking on a new leader.
Anyhow, it's shaping up for a fight.
An amusing feature of the jockey
ling—both "ante" and "post" the pri
mary—is told of the antics of a rather
recent comer from Tacoma to the city
of Olympia whose ambitions spur him
toward becoming a political power of
no mean importance hereabouts.
Needless to say he failed, of course,
but not before he had suggested to
the Hopkins' forces the great advisa
bility of electing him a precinct com
mitteeman and had been turned down,
and had then turned to the "antis"
and recommended that they not only
make him a precinct officer but state
committeeman, and received more
prompt rejection there. His next
move was to "ball out" the "antis",
with what vehemence he could and
"sweeten up" to the Hopkins forces,
but the end is not yet.
DEMOCRACY TRANQUIL.
I
Comparative tranquility, on the
other hand, will probably mark the
sessions of the Democratic county cen
jtral committee Saturday. P. M. Troy
will without any question be re-nameil
| state committeeman, though there be
[two or three Democrats around here
who would prefer to see somebody
|else; and R. M. Fuller can doubtless
!be county chairman again if he
j wants to.
i That's about all there is for the
committee to do, and the committee is
practically unanimous in favoring
these men. The question of endorsing
the Non-Partisan movement may
again come before the committee, but
as local Democrats in county conven
tion last spring and in the county
central committee meeting a few
weeks ago gave formal endorsement
to the movement, no change in policy
is apt to be made now.
The members of the Democratic
committee are:
Olympia:
First ward, First precinct, John H.
Caughon; Second precinct, Chas. Du
fault.
Second ward, First precinct, T. J.
Kegley; Second precinct, R. M. Ful
ler.
Fourth ward, First precinct, E. N.
Steele; Second, O. C. Nally.
Fifth ward, First precinct, J. B.
Stentz; Second, T. J. Miller; Third,
P. M. Troy.
South Bay—F. S. Madden.
MsLane—M. Ahearn.
Rainier—Albert Gehrke.
Mud Bay—E. T. Young.
Yelm—J. C. Conine.
Chambers' Prairie—Dell Kagy.
Lacey (Woodlawn) —C. P. Hicks.
Black Lake-—Geo. F. Meyer.
South Union—Otto Ferguson.
Tenino First precinct, M. B.
Peterson.
Tenino—Second precinct, L. A. Mc-
Lain.
Gate—T. Mounts.
Grand Mound—J. O. Parrish.
Rochester—W. A. Perkins.
Maytown—D. E. Servis.
Tunnvater—First precinct, R. B.
Mcintosh.
Tumwater—Second precinct, P.
Briggs, or Kempher (tied).
No committeemen were elected in
the following precincts: Sherlock,
Peninsula, Gull Harbor, Bucoda, Mc
intosh, Tono, Bordeaux, and Little
THERE'S MUD IN TUB AIR.
The organization of the county cen
tral committees will clear the way for
the county campaign, and it promises
to be a lively one. One of the Hop
kins' lieutenants is authority for the
statement that it is going to be a
hotly fought contest, with its partic
ular feature a special mud-slinging
campaign against Prosecuting Attor
ney Geo. F. Yantis, and a few slight
ing remarks now and then anent the
county commissioners elected on the
Non-Partisan ticket two years ago.
| And he hinted to the editor of this
newspaper that perhaps some state
ments made by it during the past two
years, with particular reference to
these same commissioners might bob
up a time or two before November 7.
He is welcome to use them. This
newspaper does not now, will not dur-j
ing the coming campaign and has not
in the past, sought or desired or at
tempted or proposed to cover up any
body's mistakes. It strives to print
the truth —in that, at least, it is J
unique in this field—and if the truth 1
can be made any discomfort to any
body, such is the way of this world.
This newspaper will support whom
it pleases in the county campaign,
and it pleases not to support the Hop
kins' ticket. It will leave that to Ta- i
coma. The fact that some of those I
whom it may support in the current |
campaign have made mistakes in the|
past will not deter it from supporting!
them in this juncture, for the strange j
part of it all is that only those people j
who do things make mistakes, and:
this newspaper prefers above all else,
an active official, a man who is not;
afraid to go ahead and do what he j
thinks best to do even though he,
later discovers a mistake, and an offi- j
cial who is free to do what he thinks
should be done —this newspaper pre
fers such an official to a machine-1
named candidate who daren't make a j
move without asking "him" about it. j
And it is glad to support George F. j
Yantis in his campaign for re-elec-'
tion. All the mud that can be thrown
at him, all the misrepresentations of |
the past, present or future about him \
and his official acts, all the criticism;

and industrious and actually accom

PRICE FIVE CENTS
BUYS MORE FIRE HOSE.
Council Also Proposes to liLstal 80
New Hydrants Throughout City.
The city council this week pur
chased 1,000 feet of new fire hose
from the Olympia Hardware company
and adopted a resolution calling for
the installation of 86 new fire hy
drants in different, parts of the city
according to plans prepared by City
Engineer J. B. Weddell.
The new hose is purchased from
the same company which recently
furnished that upon which acid was
found, and F. G. Blakeslee of the
hardware company notified the coun
cil that the faulty lengths would be
replaced. The resolution concerning
new fire hydrants is published among
the "City Legal Notices" on page 6.
They are to be installed on the im
provement district plan.
NOMINEES ON TWO
TICKETS IDENTICAL
PRACTICALLY SAME PERSONS
NAMED BY DEMOCRATS AND
NON-PARTISANS.
i Practically the same persons were
I nominated on the Democratic and
Non-Partisan tickets in the primaries
: last week, according to the results of
I the official count made this week by
the county commissioners, Prosecut
ing Attorney Geo. F. Yantis and
Auditor Annie Gaston, and this is
taken as an indication that only one
ticket, the Non-Partisan, will be in
the field in the county campaign this
fall, in opposition to the Republican
nominees.
The vote on the Non-Partisan tick
et was very light, due to the fact that
in order to vote this ticket, the voter
could not vote on either the Repub
lican or Democratic atate tickets-, bnt
the vote for the same nominees on
tha Democratic county ticket was
much larger. No precinct commit
teemen were elected on the Non
partisan ticket and in 19 precincts
none of its ballots was cast.
With the exception of two of the
legislative candidates and the nomi
nees for sheriff, justice of the peace
and constable, the candidates on the
two tickets are identical, and are:
Clerk, F. H. Sylvester; auditor, Mar
garet Shaw; assessor, John W. 1
Peters; prosecntlng attorney, Geo. F.!
Yantis; treasurer, B. R. McClelland; \
county superintendent, Geo. E. Conn;
engineer, C. P. Hicks; coroner, Dr. j
Nugent; commissioner First district,'
B. F. Littlejohn; Second district, Mc-I
Intosh.
On the Democratic ticket Harry L.
Parr was nominated for senator and
A. S. Caton and C. C. Aspinwall for
I representatives; while the nominees
on the Non-Partisan ticket were those
regularly filed, Mrs. A. E. Shedon for
senator, and Miss Mary L. Page and
IA. S. Caton for representatives. Mrs.
! Sheldon, however, has formally with
drawn and it is reported that Miss
Page will also. For sheriff Patrol
man T. M. McVey was nominated on
the Democratic ticket and E. B. Con
ner on the Non-Partisan; T. J. Miller
I for justice of the peace and R. A. Mc
-1 Nair for constable on the Democratic
I ticket, and G. H. Uhler for justice
l and W. D. Manler for constable on
l the Democratic ticket,
j The candidates on these tickets
j whose names were written in at the
primaries will not be required to pay
flling fees, under the decision given
by the supreme court two years ago.
Whether all of them will accept the
nominations will be reported at the
county central committee meetings
Saturday, when steps will be taken to
fill any places that may be vacant.
Mrs. W. T. Wright and daughter
Mabel, who plan to go east of the
mountains soon to make their home,

go East for an extended visit soon,

afTair at the Masonic TemDle Wednes

the Eastern Star.

dreams of anybody's imagination
And If he has made mistakes, more,
power to him!
That is the general situation—the
details of it will come later. There
is only one thing additional —George
F. Yantis will be re-elected.

that stolen had been returned, and
that the deficit would not amount to

I The remainder was received by Sec

Need of Fair Shown.
I "The exhibits were better this

"I believe the greatest interest was
shown in the educational display, and
Children's Day was the most success

It may cost a little time and money,
but I heard Mr. Klumb of the Capital
City Creamery say he had been well

A complete financial statement will
be made by Secretary Snow within
the next few days and whatever
