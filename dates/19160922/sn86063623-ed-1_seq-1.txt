Too Much Mavel.
The Athletics suffered another
defeat Sunday at the hands of
the W. J. Kings of Kansas City.
But we might say that a Lex
ington ball player won the game
for the visitors. Harvey Mavel,
who played at second base regu
lar last season with the Lexing
ton Greys, went to right field in
the second inning after their
catcher had been disabled, and
the fielder came in to do the re
ceiving. They had only nine
men with them. Mavel got two
of Kansas City's four hits, one
of them a double over the left
field fence with two men on the
bases. The other blow was a
single that scored two men. This
was the first game Harvey had
played this season, but his play
ing was the feature of Sun
day's contest.
Joe Terino, an Italian, who
formerly pitched for the All-nation
ball club was in the box for
the locals and pitched a good
game, struck out 15 men and
allowed 4 hits. Lexington was
successful in getting 5 hits off
the visiting pitcher. Batteries:
Kansas City, Anderson and
Brier; Lexington, Terino and
Shinn.

intendent of schools, died Tues

BIG ENROLLMENT
The Year Promises to be
the

Capt. Palmer posseses firmness,
energy and ability, the essential
qualities necessary in the hand
ling of boys, and besides takes
an active interest in all other
departments of the academy. He
is ably assisted by a strong
faculty and a banner year of the
academy's history may be antic
ipated. Detective Shinkle Wounded.
John T. Shinkle, detective for
the Missouri Pacific Railroad,
was shot and slightly wounded
Sunday night during an encount
trying to steal a ride on a

Shinkle's revolver and inflicted
a slight flesh wound in the right
hip. The youngster made his
escape. ;
