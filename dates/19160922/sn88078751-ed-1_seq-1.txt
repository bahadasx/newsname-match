Bouchavcncs, north of tho Sommo.
The T itons threw attack after at

according' to Paris, which adds that
tho Germans lost heavily.
During liio fighting tho Germans
penetrated tho northeastern pari of
the villago of Bouchavesnea, but hor.e
tho Froneh met them with tho bayo
net and dislodged them.
In tho eastern theater, in Russia and
Gallcla, both Berlin and Vienna re

and southeast of Lcmborg, in Gallcla.
Local successes for the Russians iu

which they entered Transylvania in
this roglon, recaptured from them.
In Dohrudja, where tho Russians
and Roumanians have been heavily

N3T DESIRE WAR
Secretary Baker Talks to St,
Louis Eusiiiesss Men.
St. Louis, Sept. 21. Secretary of
War Baker, in an address" before tho.
Business Men's league here', said that
as secretary t of warrho had discovered
that ho army,jdoes notdesIro war.
"As a civilian," Mr, Baker said, "I
believed that "a standing army was a
mennce to', free institutions and that
tho professional soldier desired war.
But I want to mako a confession to
you. I havo found as' secretary of
war that tho entire army of the Unit
ed States, from tho commanding gen
eral to thO laBt enlisted private, does
not desire wnr, I know ot no body
of men who havo a moro singular de
votion to duty than nn army, and no
body of men would be more willing,
to lay clown their lives for their coun
try. "For three years tho greater part of
tho American army has been on the
Mexican border, nnd It has been put
to tho severest testa ever put upon
soldiers. It has had a waiting job. If
Is easy to ho a so'dlcr whon there Is
action; difficult where there Is no ac
tion. While we have heard criticism
and comprint from other sources, I
want to say that there has never been
r. word of compla'nt relative to condi
tion or service from any member or
tho regular army."
"Mr. Hughes says tho president
should have investigated the ques
tions at isine before acting. They
seem to think that, although tho
house was on tiro, the president
should havo inquired Into tho cause of
the fire ba'ore nutting it out. Instead
of first putt'ng it out and then Inves

Preparations Completed For the

men In Sympathy With the Car
Men Rioting Renewed In Connec
tion With Strike Dynamite Plot
Frustrated by Police.
New York, Sept. 21. Aftor peace
efforts of Mayor Mltchel and others
had failed, rioting was resumed here
In connection with the streetcar
strike.
Several hundred strikers and their
sympathizers, who attacked four sur
face cars, engaged in a running fight
with police reserves, during which
several persons, Including a woman,
were hurt. Many arrests were made.
What the police characterized as a
conspiracy to use dynamite in tho
strike was frustrated by tho arrest of
a man who asserted he was a striking
motorman. The prisoner, it was said,
had attempted to purchase explosives
from a laborer d a new subway exca-
vat'on. The latter reported the case
to the authorities, who set a trap for
the striker. J
When Po'Ico Commissioner Woods '
was told t'nat elx-year-old Louis Ro
dell was dying, a victim of a brick '
burled, he redoubled his efforts at
clearing roof tops contiguous to the
traction lines and went into confer
ence with District Attorney Swan to
provide for the speedy punishment of
such offenders. The commissioner is-1
sued a warning to the strikers that !

In sympathy with tho. ear men was di- j

that a personal appeal he had made to

the strikers had met w!th a flat re-,
fusal. Meantime, prera-atlons were
continued bv union leaders for the
walkout which, If carried out, ma7
paralyze Industry throughout the
greater city. I
Apparently the only chance now of
calling off tho union officials in their
determination "to tie up New York" '
by Monday next, lies in a conference
to bo held between a clt'zens' commit
tee and the strike leaders. '
Samuel Gompers. president of the
