to indicate that returns from pre

anv derided change in the relative

nominees for the two places ou the

present apparent results of the pil-

William C. Robinson of Colorado
Snrtnrs may nose out Rees for the

Don, but Rees still has a 4"" b ad. and
this looks Safe. Robinson's chances
rest with the unreported precincts,

11,919. leading Bailey in Hie race for
the Democratic nomination for the
Supreme Court by seventy-three
votes. George W. Musser of De nver
was 712 votes behind Bailey. Robert
G. Strong of Greeley was apparently
out of the ruce. His total was 9,410.
