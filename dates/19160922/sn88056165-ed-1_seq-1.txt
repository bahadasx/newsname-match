MADE HEAVY
STOCK SHIPMENT
Forty Carloads of Cattle, Hogs
and Sheep, Valued at More
Than $50,000, Left Prairie
Tuesday.
Stock shipments from Camas
prairie this week were the heav
iest made in many weeks and a
total of about forty cars of cattle,
sheep and hogs were shipped out,
the valuation of the shipments
reaching over $50,000.
C. J. Hall, the big Snake river
stockman, shipped out 2800 head
of lambs, 400 of which went to
the coast and 2400 to the Twin
Falls country where they will be
fattened for market. Mr. Hall
drove the sheep out to Grange
ville with the loss of only two
lambs and stated that he received
the fancy price of 8 cents a pound
for them.
Most of tyie cattle shipments
were made from this place and
consisted of nine carloads of fat
steers and cows purchased by
John Rothlisberg for Carsteen &
Company at Seattle. The cattle
were secured in the Salmon River
country and included purchases
from the herds of Pick Chamber
lain, D. F. VanPool, E. A. Lan
caster, Carl Flynn and others.
Two carloads of cattle purchased
from E. A. Lancaster were prime
three-year-olds and tipped the
beam at right near the 1300
mark, the 41 head making an
average weight of 1295 pounds
each. Six cows in the bunch also
ran close to the 1200 pound mark.
The price paid for these cattle
was 6i cents for steers and 5
cents for cows. These were the
best cattle to come out from the
river countryJfor*someItime and
Mr. Lancaster attributes their
superiority to the fact that they
are salted frequently, run on
their own range without inter
ference from other herds and
herders, and are worked easily
and become quite gentle. He
also has plenty of feed to run
him through the winter months
and his stock always goes onto
the spring range in good shape.
One car of hogs, for which the
fancy price of 9 cents per pound
was paid, was shipped out Tues
day by the Farmers Union Ware
house company. Several cars
were also shipped from other
points on the prairie, the total
shipments being 11 cars of cattle,
8 cars of hogs, and about 21 cars
of sheep.
Dr. Smith Changes Location
Dr. H. J. Smith returned Mon
day evening from a trip to Mos
cow and gave out word the next
day that he would leave next
week with his family for that
place where be intends to locate
and practice dentistry. He has
sold his office and practice here
to Dr. Reilly, of Genesee, who
comes highly recommended as a
dentist and a citizen of the prop
er progressive, booster type. He
has resided in Genesee continu
ously for the past ten years and
his removal from that town is
viewed with much regret by its
citizens. Dr. Smith has built up
a nice practice since coming to
our city and has become known
as a loyal town booster. He is
making the change in order to be
near his aged parents. We are
sorry to lose the Smiths from our
city and wish them the best of
success wherever they may go
but are glad to have them suc
ceeded by such estimable people
as Dr. Reilly and family.
Dr. and Mrs. J. D. Shinnick
were Lewiston visitors Tuesday.
Bad Accident Occurs
An accident that will undoubt
edly be attended by fatal results
occured in this city Tuesday
morning when a horse ridden
by Jesse Hockersmith ran into
a wire fence on the hill above
the old planing mill and threw
his rider onto the rocks, after
ward rolling over him. Young
Hockersmith was chasing a steer
that had escaped from tne stock
yard and was rounding the hill
side at a fast pace. At the point
where the accident occured a
couple strands of smooth wire
had been stretched across a small
opening from one fence to the
other and the steer jumped or
went through the wire. The
horse evidently tried to stop and
was caught in the wire and fell,
throwing the young man onto the
rocky hillside with great force
and afterward rolling completely
over him. Men on the street
saw the accident and the injured
rider was soon picked up and
carried to the hotel where Dr.
Turner attended him. No bones
were broken but the young man
was unconscious and remained in
this condition without change
throughout day and night. On
Wednesday it was decided to
operate on him for possible frac
ture of the skull or hemorrhage
of the brain and Dr. Orr, assisted
by Dr. Stockton and Nurse Cal
houn, of Grangeville, performed
an operation about noon. The
operation disclosed that the fall
received had shattered the brain
badly and little hope was had for
the patient's recovery. He stood
the shock of the operation nicely
but^lid not regain consciousness
and is apparently growing weak
er as time passes.
The young man is a sop of J.
W. Hockersmith who operates
the Rice creek ferry, and is about
24 years of age. He had been
working here in town since early
in the spring and has spent most
of his life in this country, having
formerly resided for a number of
years with his parents in Grange
ville.
The accident was one of those
regrettable affairs which can
happen to anyone and could not
well be foreseen or prevented.
While there is still a small
chance for recovery the physi
cians hold out small hope to the
relatives of the young man.
Reports Big Wheat Yield
Sidney Brown handed in this
week the best crop report that
we have yet received this season.
On his farm north of town he
threshed an average of 50 bushels
of Red Russian wheat from a
fiield of 70 acres and another
field of 26 acres produced an
average of more than 51 bushels
of the same grain, while his
spring sown Blue Stem wheat
went better than 35 bushels to
the acre and is some of the clean
est and brightest grain he has
ever seen. If any of our farmers
can beat these records we would
like very much to hear from them.
Valuable Crop
James Tobin brought the first
load of cow peas to the Farmers'
Union warehouse Thursday
morning that was ever delivered
in Genesee.
The load consisted of 60 sacks,
each weighing 136 pounds, and
placing them at an estimated
valuation of four cents a pound,
the load was worth $426.40. Mr.
Tobin had not yet finished thrash
ing, but estimated that the yield
will probably reach 800 sacks. —
