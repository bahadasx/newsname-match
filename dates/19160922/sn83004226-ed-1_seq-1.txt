VALUABLE ADDRESSES
CHAUTAUQUA AT LOUISA PRE
SENTED A FINE LIST OF
8PCAKERS.
Thm flmt session of the Farmer'
Chautauqua wu held In l. J. Bur
hett'a picture ahow houm Tuesday af
ternoon. Dr. Crlsler. State Veterin
arian, spoke on hogs and their diseases
and preventions, and we only regret
that every farm or who raises hoK did
uut tear thi talk;
Mr. Chapln, U. H. Poultry man, gave
an Illustrated lecture on poultry, show
ing the diftiyent constructions of poul
try houses, brooding, rearing and mar-
ketlng. Also, othor Interesting pictures
of what other people are dulng in other
Stale. .
Mr. Chapln looked over the poultry
prospects here and was very murh
pleased, saying that he was sure that
no other product would pay the farm
ers of lAwronce county so well. If he
would Improve his stuck, getting all his
ehlckens one breed.
Mrs. Wolrutl told us how chickens
should he and could ha made a by-product,
that the by-products of the farm
were the ones that made the money
for us.
Mrs. Melon H. Wolcott Hlate Agent
of Hume Iemonslratlon work, came
third on Tuesday's program snd an she
always dors, sent her audience aw
charmed Mra. Wolcott had one ad
vantage over the men lecturers. She
had an audience of most Interested
women which gave her nddpd enthu
siasm. If the farmers, snd men had
come out the first day, as did the wo
men, we would have had a crowd proud
to sek altout.
Mrs. Waleott didn't brlmt the same
thoughts and Idnas lhat we have hoard
so much, but she brought new ones,
and bis- ones. Being herself a farmer
and bavins a dairy that pays her more
than any other dairy In the State, she
was able to bring a special tnsaaoge
about the dairy and profits of the farm.
Mra. Woleott was pleased with the
work here, which la under her super
vision, and hopes that It may be con
tinued. Wednesday's sessions lacked In quan
tity, but paid In full In quality. In the
first placs the list or .teakera shows
thla Mr. Collins, District Agent of
Kastem Kentucky, who has Lawrence
oounty at heart, was here. Mr. lOlllott
horticulturist, the man who came to
tell us how to trow better apples and
better fruit In general and Mr. Har
rison spoke on oo-operatlon.
Miss lleynolds, from the State Ool
ite, spoke on the Live Hlick of Ken
tucky, the boy and the girl, and those
who missed this talk mlsited more than
an ordinary talk. Miss Heynolds said
that no other children came up with
the Kentucky boy and girl and that all
they needed was a chance. We all know
that Kentucky la behind In her educa
tion, but we hardly knew It was- so
much until Miss lleynolds told us that
whera Illinois spent 11000 on her boys
and girls we Kenturklans spend II.
Mr. Collins Is very much pleased with
the Interest being taken In live slock
'and better stock and he said that Law
rence county was making a record for
herself at present, and that Mr. Young,
Count Agent, had well earned his sal
ary by proving the Interest and placing
the animals In the .county that Mr.
Woods has gone to buy.
- Mr.' Chapln, pouMry man, remained
to speak again, on club work In Law
rence oounty,' but owing to the lateness
of the hour and the fact that the few
there had been'so patient, the Chau
tauqua of two days came to a close
after a talk from Col. Northup. In which
CoL thanked the few for coming and
especially the one or two farmers that
had left thoir forms at this busy time
to come.
On Tuesday the Olrls Canning Club
from Oalltip came, cbaparoned by Mrs.
T S. McClure and Mr. John H. Mc
ciure, Oallup's people always respond
and you can alwiy count on them.
These little girls deserved the treat of
seeing Mrs. Wolcott and of hearing her.
and It made them know that they are
really a part of the great work and 10
. ..- -. jnn iHrie. who are reaping
ok m i oww
the. -benf fits of Mrs. Wolcott s groat
ortfiinlaatlon.
Although the crowd was small we
hope that some one, even a single per
son received some good from the people
who came to us, If so their trouble of
coming was fully repaid.
We thank those who did come and
only wish more of you could have come.
Mr. Burchett deserves an extra thank
for Ms kindness of lending us not only
house but his machine for our Illus
trative lecture. Such co-operation from
Mr Burchett our newspapers and our
people at large, make us grow Into a
better Lawrence county.

Lsst Fall.
Martlnaburg. W. Va, Sept. 13. Char
les Jefferson Harrison, of San Antonio,
Tel., made a full confession of the train
robbery with which he was charged In
the United States Court here to-day
before Judge Payton. Sentence of 12
years' Imprisonment In the peniten
tiary at Atlanta, la, was Immediately
Imposed.
Harrison presented a pathetic figure
when he advanced to the bar to con
fess, after pleading .not guilty yester
day to the nine Indictments. Weak and
emaciated by tuberculosis, from which
he Is suffering, his voice was scarcely
audible.
The crime was the robbery of a Bal
timore & Ohio train near Central Sta
tion. W. Va, on October 8, 191B. With
Harrison was Implicated Eugene Pies,
who will be placed on trial next, and
H. Grady Wrebh, who never has been
arrested. The robbers took from the
express car of the train more than
100,000 In unsigned bank notes, much
of which has been recovered.
Harrison for the first time since his
arrest talked freely with United Slates
Marshal Smith after being sentenced.
He told of climbing Into the cab and
at the point of a revolver compelling
Engineer Grant Helms, after the en
gine and mall cars had been detached
from the rest of the train, to run the
locomotive two miles down tho track,
where the mall cars were refled. Har
rison and his companions then fled to
the woods, where they divided their
loot and remained a few days. They
then separated.
Harrison said he returned to his
home in San Antonio. Tex., where he
reopened his machine shop after bury
ing 128,000 under the floor. This was
recovered when tho Federal authorities
searched the shop after his arrest. He
said he had never killed a man. hut
was present when his gang murdered
a postal clerk In Alabama several years
ago. For his part In the crimo he was
sentenced to life Imprisonment, but
President McKlnley commuted It to ten
years and President Roosevelt pardon
ed him after he had served seven years.

KENTUCKY CROP REPORT. '
Generally speaking the corn crop bids
fair to be a good one. In fact, the best
In years In some localities, although
much damage Is reported by recent
storms. The condition of corn as a
stats average Is given at 92 per cent.
The condition of cow pea. 1. given at
8 per cent, while soy beans show at
88 per cent. It Is worth while to, note
what an Increased acreage In these two
crops Is shown In some counties while
in other counties no report Is made at
all as these crops are raised there. Pas
ture conditions are good, showing much
Improvement since the late rains. At
present Blue Grass shows an average
of 87 per -cent, clover at 87 per cent,
orchard gross at 91 per cent and alfalfa
87 per cent. The third cutting of alfalfa
1. estimated to yield two ton. per acre
and the prospects for the fourth good.
Murh complaint Is ffade of garden
conditions generally throughout the
State. The average condition Is given
at 80 per cent. The condition of Irish
potatoes Is given at 79 per cent. The
outlook for fruit Is very unsatisfactory.
Apples are falling off badly and their
average condition Is given at 59 per
cent. Peaches are very scarce and faul
ty and show a condition of 79 per cent.
Pear, are given at-68 per cent and
grapes at 84 per cent
There seems to be a scarcity of live
stock reported In many places, but the
condition of all live stock Is splendid.

OUTPUT OF COAL
GREATEST IN HISTORY
E8TIMATE8 INDICATE INCREASE
OF ABOUT THIRTY-FIVE
PER CENT.
Washington. The output of bltumln
ous coal In the United States during
the first six month, of 1916 was ths
greatest ever recorded In any half-year
period. Estimate, made to-day by C. E.
Lasher, of the Geological Survey, bas
ed on returns from over 100 rallroaJs
originating coal and coke shipments,
indicate that the production during this
period was 261,000,000 tons, an increase
of 86 per cent, over the first six months
of 1915, and of 5 per cent over the last
six months of the same year, and great
er by several million tons than the
record established in the last half of
1918. Compared with the first half of
1915 the exports from the Atlantic sea.
board during the last six months have
Increased about 10 per cent and the
coal used In coking has Increased near
ly one-half. Increased consumption by
railroads and by the Iron and steel and
nearly all other Industries has been a
large factor In establishing this rec
ord. From April, 1916, to January of
the present year the production of
bituminous coal Increased at a rapid
rate, with but temporary slackening in
November and December due to car
shortage. The output in January, 1916,
was more than 60 per cent greater
than In April, 1915, and the production
In February and March, 1916. was near
ly as great Many large user, of coal
laid in stocks of fuel In anticipation of
a possible shutdown at the mines In
April because of labor troubles, and,
though there was no general strike; the
production In April declined greatly as
a result of decreased buying on the
part of those having stored coal to use.
May and June, however, showed suc
cessive increases, and there is every In
dication that the production during the
coming six months will equal if not ex
ceed the six months just past and that
the output in the calendar year 1916
will exceed 600,000,000 tons, establish
ing a new record for bituminous coal.
Every coal-producing State from
Washington to the Atlantic Coast has
shared In this general Increase.
The output of beehive coke has in
creased from about 11,260,000 ton. In
the first half of 1915 and 16,250,000 tons
In the second half of 1915 to more than
18,000,000 ton. during the last six
months. The manufacture of coke In
by-product oven, has also Increased as
new ovens have been completed and
put In commission. :
The production of Pennsylvania
anthracite Increased about 3 per cent
over the corresponding period In 1915.
