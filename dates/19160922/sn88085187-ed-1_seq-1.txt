"I hope women ha.c the future of the world in their hands-
It would then, I hope, become more spiritual—something the
Western world sadly needs."
By Jack Jungmeyer.
A prophet of the world's affairs directed by wom
en.
Such is Sir Hahiudranath Tagore, Hindu philoso
pher, scholar, aesthetic and poet, who is today in Ta
coma to begin a national lecture tour in the interest
of his school in the Orient.
Attired in robe and skull cap, speaking English
fluently, his brown eyes flashing behind spectacles,
Sir Kabindranath Tagore is the embodiment of the
spiritual messages he has set out to deliver in Amer
ica.
Winner of the Nobel literary prize and knighted by
England's king, he is internationally almost as well
known as he is among the people of his beloved India,
to whom he is devoting a remarkable life.
He discussed for an hour with me the big under
takings and ideals that lie nearest his heart.
A world opened to Indian emi
grants; America as the Mecca for
all races ln a closer spiritual
bond; anti-mllltarlsm; the domi
nance of women ln completing
the Ideals of civilization—these
things he links together in earn
est advocacy.
Women to Mold Future.
"I hope," he said, "that the fu
ture of the world is In the hands
of women. And I believe it is.
"Women began the organiza
tion of society in the misty past.
Then the matriarchal rather than
the patriarchal system was in ef
fect. Only in the middle time
have we digressed, and we shall
again go back, to complete civi
lization, to woman's guidance.
"I presume the demand for suf
frage ;by American women is a
groping toward the ability to ex
press their power toward a higher
form of spiritual well being ln
this country and elsewhere.
Men at End of Rope.
"We men have gone about as
far as we can in performing our
part of universal advance, it
seems to me."
The distinguished Hindu scholar
speaks rapidly, and so earnestly
that his long gray hair shakes to
the emphasis of his nods.
"America," he continued, "has
no right to shut out any other
races, unless they are morally un
desirable—not because of the
color of their skin. .
"This Is Roing against its great
est traditions.
I'nrcstrlctod Immigration.
"I hope you will not enact reac
tionary legislation to that end.

with the problem adequately.

tlie grand jury on a charge of
rioting at tlie east approach of the
11th street bridge July 10, waa'
dismissed in Jud«e Card's court
Friday.
Deputy Prosecutor Phelps mov-1
ed for the dismissal, declaring all
the evidence showed clearly that
Knudsen was nowhere near the
bridge at tlie time of tlie killing
of young Kangval Leluann, strike
breaker.
Phelps said Knudsen had a
complete alibi so far as this dis-j
turbance was concerned and that
there was no use for the state to I
attempt to press the case.
Knudsen was first arrested in I
connection with the Sperry mill i
riot June 26, but was later dls
missed when the grand jury re
turned a "no true bill" in ills
case.
After the young strike-breaker
had been shot, his father went to
the longshoremen's hah and pick
ed out Knudsen as the man who
had done the shooting.
All other witnesses agreed that
he was not near the scene.

BERLIN, via wireless It> Kayville. 1.. 1„ Sept. 22.
—A German submarine sank an enemy transport}
completely filled with troops, in the Mediterranean
on Sept, 17, it was officially announced today.
The transport sank within 13 second*.
The Berlin statement made no mention of the late
of the soldiers aboard the transport.
Accepting the statement that the transport went
down in 41. seconds as true, it appears probable that
few, if any persons were rescued unless other vessel!
were in the immediate vicinity.
BARGAIN IN
BOOZE, SAYS
STANTON W.
Both sides are holding their
fire In the case against former
Congressman Stanton Warburton,
accused of bringing 19 gallons of
booze from Chicago to Tacoma in
a trunk.
They have asked time to look
up the nice law points in ques
tion.
Warburton admitted that he
bought 19 gallons of liquor in
Chicago and checked it in a trunk
to Tacoma. But lie Is standing
on the contention that he had the
constitutional right to bring it
here for his own personal use.
Also, because the trunk was
grabbed by officials In Tacoma
before he got to It, Warburton is
claiming he "never received it or
had it in his possession" ln this
dry state.
What he did do, he says, was to
turn ln his trunk check and or
der the booze shipped to his resi
dence.
Incidentally, Warburton sets
out in his statement that the
booze cost him only 70 cents a
quart in Chicago, whereas If he
had taken out a permit in Ta
coma and ordered it from abroad
it would have cost him not less
than $1.75 a quart—lndicating,
It is understood, that he had good
reason to get it in Chcago.

said chandler Kriday.
"In the firm place, an Insur
