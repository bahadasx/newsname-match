COUNTY AUTHORITIES
FEAR LYNCHING OF MAN
Message Left Beside Body Says Act
Was Done Because of Beauty
of Girl.
FEELING IN DISTRICT
IS VERY INTENSE
No Trace of Assailant Stranger in
the Neighborhood May Come
This Way.
A Two hundred armed men are
^searching the woods near Round
Lake and in the Blackduck dis
trict today in an effort to find the
man who attacked Miss Dahl.
Up to a late hour this afternoon
they have been unable to find
any trace of the man. Business
has been neglected and the entire
district is up in arms. The feel
ing is very intense.
Late this afternoon Miss Dahl
was reported to be resting easier.
In a statement she said that the
man who attacked her left her
V.-^at about sis o'clock in the morn
ing. It is believed that he evi
dently was frightened away by
searching parties at that time.
Brainerd Men Aroused.
Brainerd, Minn., Sept. 22.
(By United Press)Minnesota &
International trainmen have or
anized a posse here and will go
to Bemidji tonight to aid in the
search for the assailant of Olga
Dahl. Agitation is high here.
Because she was pretty, Olga Dahl,
school teacher in the log school house
near Round Lake in Goodhope town
ship, Itasca county, is on her death
bed as. a result of a brutal assault
and being shot through the head
twice by an unknown assailant.
Writes Messaee.
Her assailant, a stranger described
as being 30 years old, dark complex
ion, short, wearing black hat, dark
suit and button shoes, wrote this as
an explanation of his act after he
had lashed the girl to a tree, as
saulted and shot her. He wrote the
message in a time book after tearing
out several of the pages and placed
the book near the body. The mes
sage, written in broken English, is
.as follows:
"This is a preety friend of
heres and shee is too pretty for
here one good so I thinkg I will
fix her so if you stand happy to
find this boddes I see you later.
"Slept. 20, 1916."
The note is interpreted as follows:
"This is a gretty good friend
*of her's and she is too pretty for
Tier own good, so I think that I
,wUl fix her. If you should hap
Ipen to find this body, I will see
jyou later."
On Man Hunt.
Today the entire district is on'a
man hunt. Merchants, lumberjacks
and farmers, armed with weapons of
all) descriptions, are searching the
-woods. Sheriff Gunderson of Grand
Rapids arrived at the scene late last
night and has deputies watching all
trains and outlets.
A Heavy rain lash night hampered
t,b,e work of the pursuers but it is
betfeved that the assailant is still in
this district.
The little log school is located
about 26 miles from Blackduck, ^-1.
Last Monday morning school ..wfLS

THE BEMIDJI KML
near the school late in the afternoon.
Miss Dahl failed to return to her
home that night and search was made
early yesterday morning. Near the
school signs of a struggle were found.
About one-half mile from the school
in the woods, with her arms lashed
to a tree, her clothes torn, Miss Dahl
was found with two bullet shots
through her head, semi-unconscious.
Destroys Eve.
The bullets were from a revolver,
one striking near the base of the
brain and completely destroying her
left eye and the other passing
through her neck.
Near her was a small fire, a look
ing glass, a new razor, time book,
candle and a tobacco can filled with
matches. Her wrists were lashed to
a tree by a buckskin belt lacing.
She was taken to the home of
Henry Korpi, about one-half mile
away, where an alarm was given and
Dr. John C. Koch of Blackduck was
called. He stated last evening that
he did not believe the girl would re
cover.
The girl's sister, Mrs. Clarence
Locken of Deer River, was called.
Feeline Intense.
The feeling is intense and hun
dreds of armed men were pursuing
the assailant. The only trace of him
was about a mile from the scene to
wards Blackduck where an old shack
was found to have a window broken
and various articles taken yesterday
morning.
A heavy rain yesterday hampered
the work of the pursuers. It is be
lieved, however, that the man will
be captured. It is believed that he
headed toward Blackduck or Bemidji
in an attempt to escape.
Efforts were made yesterday to se
cure bloodhounds, but on account of
the rain they will be of little use if
secured.
Man Not Known.
That the girl may have known the
stranger prior to his coming to the
Lemien home is advanced by several
of the pursuers. It is believed, how
ever, that this was not the case, by
the county authorities.
During a period of consciousness
yesterday afternoon, when questioned
by Dr. Koch, Miss Dahl said that she
did not know the man's name.
There is no school in the little
log school house today the children
are at home with their mothers while
their fathers are searching for the
man who
attackedr
the prett teacher.
'Authorities fea lynchiny if the
man is captured.

For 1
years the average daily expense of
operating 6,0d0 miles of the North
ern Pacific has been $148,780 or $53,-
741,895 a year, a statement issued
by the road said today. Granting
that the Northern Pacific operating
expenses is above the average, be
cause it spends money more readily
to improve service, the combined ex
penditure of operating all roads will
be well into eleven figures.
Daily the Northern Pacific spends
$19,797 for permanent improvements'
or $7,225,905 a year for betterment.
With rapid development of the great
Northwest, this sum will perhaps be
increased. CONSCRIPTION BELIEVED

HUGHES OR WILSON?
RObSEVELT'S ANSWER
"Against Mr. Wilson's com
bination of grace in elocution
with futility in action against
his record of words unbacked by
deeds or betrayed by deeds, we
see Mr. Hughes' rugged an un
compromising straightforward
ness of character and action in
every office he has held. We
put the man who thinks and
speaks directly, and whose
words have always been made
good, against the man whose
adroit and facile elocution is
used to conceal his plans or his
want of plans. The next four
years may well be years of tre
mendous national strain. Which
of the two men do you, the
American people, wish at the
helm during these four years
the man who has been actually
tried and found wanting, or the
man whose whole career in pub
lic office is a guarantee of his
power and good faith? But one
answer is possible and it must 2
be given by the American people
through the election of Charles
Evans Hughes as President of
the United States.''Roosevelt
