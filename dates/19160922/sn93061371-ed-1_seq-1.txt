contained In h'.s double column

Ll i is paper; we fWl at liberty to
take issue with jiim; hi the
first place he says that "con
gress hastily acted under a
threat of four leaders.'' When
the facts in the case are; that
matter was entirely out of the
reach of "the four leaders" at
the time it was submitted to
Congress; that 400,000 trainmen
had spoken, had acted. The
day und the hour was set for
the general strike unless their
demands were met. It vV,.s no
tin eat.
' Again he says the trainmen
are tha hest paid men in i ail way
service.
Another statement that is
mi.-leading. While we frankly
adn.it that the trainmen are
wrci.i, paid are paid perhaps all
tilt y should liu,pHi.l, yet they
are not the ufcsT" paru. 1 lie of
ficers of the lfailroadd are the
best paid in the service, of
which Mr. Ripley is the lushest.
