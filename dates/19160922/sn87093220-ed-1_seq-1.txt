THIRTIETH YEAR
4 S. TRADE COMMISSION
STUDIES LUMBER PROBLEM
Northwestern Lumber Manufacturers Deeply
Interested In Coming Decision of the
Federal Commission
TO AFFECT PROSPERITY OF PACIFIC COAST
National Lumber Association Files Brief With
Commission. Favorable Decision Is
Looked For
SEATTLE, Sept. 21. —The lumber
manufacturers of the Pacific North
west are awaiting with much anxiety
the decision of the federal trade com
mission regarding the legality of the
proposed combination of lumbermen.
The decision will determine the status
or the new Douglas Fir Exploitation
& Export company, and will also de
cide if the lumbermen have the right
to enter into an agreement not to sell
lumber below the cost of production.
The Northwestern manufacturers
look upon the coming decision as the
most important one that has ever af
fected the industry. If favorable, it
will mean that the exploitation of for
eign markets can be developed on a
tremendous scale and that the lumber
manufacturers of the entire country
can stabilize business conditions by
Betting a standard price below which
no material will be sold. If the de
cision is unfavorable it will mean a
continuance of present conditions
which, all manufacturers agree, are
rapidly becoming unbearable and
which tend to destroy the entire in
dustry.
The whole matter was submitted to
the commission by the National Lum
ber Manufacturers association. The
West Coast association took a promi
nent part in the proceedings and the
national organization filed a brief
with the commission last week giving
lumbermen's side of the case. The
national association has the support
of the Western dealers and practically
all the lumbermen In the United
. States.
Waste Enormous.
The brief is a printed document of
143 pages, which outlines the lumber
men's ideas for the settlement of the
vexing problems of the industry, and
is a sequel to a former volume which
indicated in detail, the nature of these
problems. In the former volume, the
lumbermen declared that the forests
•of the nation were being sacrificed
at prices below cost of production,
that there was enormous waste in the
industry, because of an inability of
the lumbermen to co-operate for the
elimination of abuses. It was shown
that 65 per cent of every tree cut is
waste and never reaches the consumer.
Eventually this would mean a loss to
future generations by the destruction
wastefully of the nation's timber sup
ply.
Economic conditions force the
manufacturer to discard the less valu
able portions of the tree, to get what
he can from the cream of the forest.
The brief asks the federal commission
to point out any illegality in the lum
bermen's method of solving the pro
blems, and the essential points of the
brief are as follows:
1. The lumbermen are not asking
the privilege of fixing prices. All they
wish Is to eliminate the waste that re
sults from cut-throat competitive
practices.
2. The Sherman law, rightly un

CALLED BY DEATH
■'Prominent Montesano Banker Die*
Wednesday Morning from Stroke
of Paralysis.
MONTESANO, Sept. 21.—William
Teissier, a pioneer resident and for a
number of years identified with the
business interests of this city, died at
his home on Pioneer street early-
Wednesday morning, following a
stroke of paralysis suffered the day be
fore.
Mr. Geissler was born at La Farge
ville, N. Y„ in 1853, and first acme to
this county in 1882, and excepting an
absence of five years, lived here con
tinuously. Starting in the drayage
and fuel business on a small scale, he
later acquired considerable timber
land, and at the time of his death was
a wealthy man.
Mr. Geissler leaves a widow, one
son, one daughter, two brothers and
a sister. li. L. Geissler, the son. is

derstood, does not prohibit combi
nations, the purpose of which is to
avoid the waste of uncontrolled com
petition, and at the same time, pre
serve individual initiative.
3. No case can be found, nor can
any reason be advanced, denying the
right of lumber manufacturers enter
ing into an agreement whereby it is
contracted that they will not sell their
lumber below the cost line. The steel
case specifically hold that the law as
sumes that men are in business for a
p-ofit, therefore, by agreeing not to
sell below the cost line they do not
agree as to price. The whole range of
competition is left open. There is no
competition rightly understood when
lumber is sold below cost, because
that condition will finally develop in-,
to the destruction of competitive con
ditions.
Plan Outlined.
The commission is given the de
tailed plan of the lumbermen for the
solution of their difficulties and ask
ed to point out any illegalities in the
suggestions for sales agencies and
other means of preventing selling be
low cost. If the commission can point
out where there is illegality in this
procedure, no steps will be taken, but
if the commission cannot show that
there is any legal error in the course
proposed, the lumbermen may assume
that they are clearly within their legal
rights in agreeing to ascertain the
true cost of production and agreeing
not to do business at a loss.
The brief points out that the Sher
man anti-trust law lias been decided
by the courts as applying only to com
binations controlling the major por
tion of the output of a given indus
try. The Lumber Manufacturers'
it is said, Include only
about one-third of the production of
the countdy, and therefore can not be
said in any way to control the in
dustry.
As specific remedies for the waste
ful conditions in the industry, the
commission is asked to consider the
making of cost-finding investigations,
the establishment in various districts
of sales agencies, for the economical
marketing of the product, as for in
stance four for Oregon and Washing
ton west of the Cascades, and two
east, one for redwood, one for Cali
fornia pine, one for the Inland Em
pire. one for Minnesota pine, two for
Wisconsin and Michigan, three for
Southern hard woods and seven for
yellow pine. The commission is also
asked to consider the necessity of per
mitting combination to secure foreign
export business, a recognition of the
good work for the organization of the
industry done by the various trade as
sociations, and also to study the prob
lem of the tax problem in its rela
tion to the industry, and the need for
co-operation between the industry as
a commercial business and the gov
ernment, In Its forest service, for the
I conservation of the lumber supply for
I the future.
"CIVILIZATION" STARTS AT
GRAND THEATRE SUNDAY
The much heralded and truly magni
ficent film achievement of the age is
soon to have its initial presentation
in Aberdeen for an engagement which
will extend over 4 days, with matinees
commencing Sunday.
Far beyond any other attraction of
a similar nature "Civilization" comes
to bring home to every heart its be
nign lesson of Humanity for Humanity
first and always is its theme. In ord
er to visualize the tremendous appeal
for peace, Thomas H. Ince, wizard of
motion picture craft expended a cool
million dollars and built and destroyed
whole cities in his quest for realism.
Into the depts of the mighty ocean he
delved, into the air he soared, upon
the face of the earth he reproduced
battles and in mimic warfare succeed
ed in depicting with marvelous fidel
ity what might be the actual war which
at present shakes the world. But let
it not be said that cruel war is his
only means of driving home Ills point
of view, for, while war there is, and
mighty closely does this make believe
war resemble the real thing, there
are also supremely represented the su
preme beauties of peace and tran
quility.

MONTESANO, Sept. 21—The official

of the vote cast, are electend, and will
have no opposition in November.

SHOCKED HIS WIFE
One of the funny stunts at the cir
cus Tuesday was that of a young
man dressed and made up as a wo
man, who flirted with almost every
male person who come his way on
the grounds. A man, whom we will
call Billy G., because that is not his
name, was met with a warm embrace
by the alleged lady. Not a whit
abashed, accordingto witnesses, Billy
stood for it nobly, until glancing
around, he met the petrified gaze of
his wife, when he gently disengaged
himself from the lady(?) and enter
ed the seats.

YOU SHOULD WORRY. WOODROWI
FISHBOURNE
WOULD DEBATE
Democratic Candidate (or
Congress Challenges Johnson
to a Joint Debate.
WOULD AIR THE ISSUES
Asks Calm Discussion of Poli
cies So That People of Dis
trict May Decide.
TACOMA, Sept. 21. —George P. Fish
bourne, Democratic candidate for con
gress in the third district has chal
lenged Congressman Albert Johnson,
the Republican nominee to a joint de
bate on the issues of the campaign.
In a letter sent to Mr. Johnson Fri
day evening, Mr. Fishbourne says:
" 'And ye shall know the truth
and the truth shall make you free,'
is a thought-clothing that will never
get seedy and never go out of style.
I know of no more direct route to the
truth, than a joint debate, and so I
would deem it an honor and a pleasure
if you would join me in a public dis
cussion of the national issues. We
will try to arrange the details to suit
your convenience.
"I am aware of the fact that be
cause of your superior training I would
be no match for you. But if nature
denies me the art,' the strength of
my cause and my enthusiasm would
make me speak. We should present
the case to the people and let them
decide whether I should be promoted
from enforcing the law to assisting in
making it, and whether you should
be converted from a law-maker, a con
gressman, Into a thought-createor, an
editor.
"An early reply to this letter would
be deeply appreciated."
Pierce county friends of Congress
man Johnson are of opinion that he
will accept the challenge, and that a
gentlemanly discussion of the cam
paign Issues will be a leading feature
of the campaign in the third district.

Exposure of Plans to Present Motion Pictures
Injecting Religious Issues In Campaign
Causes Republican Grief.
FORMER CONVICT EMPLOYED IN DIRTY WORK.

A Prime Mover in the Scheme
NEW YORK, Sept. 21.(Special.)—
The New York World exposure of the
Republican committee's plans to repre
sent in motion pictures President Wil
son asleep at his desk while Catholic
, nuns are assaulted by Villa bandits
. caused consternation and chagrin to
! day in Republican circles. Frantic ef
: forts were made to disavow responsi
bility, but the World follows up its
exposure by printing the circular sent
'out from Republican headquarters of
fering the film for production.
i The World story in part is as fol
lows:
"Having censored the moving pic
ture film entitled 'Watchful Waiting'
to such an extent that most of the
work described in yesterday's World
! will have to be done over again, some
[ of the members of the Republican na
tional committee yesterday denied that
! the pictures as described had ever
1 been approved.
"Former Senator Everett Colby of
* New Jersey, in charge of the Repub
llican moving picture campaign, was
I the spokesman for the committee. His
I statements were to the effect that it
J was preposterous to say that any
! thing indecent would be produced,
land, while he refused to give any de
tails whatever of the picture he had
viewed earlier In the day, he inferred
that if It did contain the scenes spok
en of in the World that the committee
would not for one moment sanction it.
"The World has come Into posses
sion of a circular prepared at Repub
lican national committee headquarters,
In which the Hal-Raid photo-play Is de

to county chairmen all over the coun

CONWAY TALKS
TO WILSON CLUB
Aberdeen Attorney Reviews
Campaign Issues Before the
Hoquiam Wilson Club
'HOQUIAM, Sept. 21.—The weekly
meeting of the Hoquiam Woodrow Wil
son League last night, was well at
tended and, as usual, quite a number
of ladies were preseyt. In opening the
meeting President P. J. Mourant an
nounced that the league, now number
ing more than 300, had plans in'prep
aration that were calculated to largely
increase the Wilson vote in Hoquiam.
Captain A. T. Stream, who Is a Demo
cratic nominee for presidential elector,
was called upon and responded with
enthusiasm.
Attorney Fred R. Conway, of Aber
deen, was the speaker of the evening,
and he held the audience in close at
tention for forty-five minutes. After
congratulating Hoquiam upon having
the largest Wilson club in the county,
he reviewed the issues of the cam
paign in a most logical manner, say
ing the President may have made mis
takes, and that if he had not he would
stand alone among men. But, he ask
ed, who can say that another would
have avoided them, or have made
less.
He showed the Mexican situation to
have been bequeathed to the admin
istration by Taft, and quoted the lat
ter as advising the same "watchful
waiting" that when pursued by Wil
son met with such hostile criticism,
yet the statement by Taft was made
only seven days before he quit the
White House.
In the course of his speech. Mr.
Conway paid his respects to the carp
ing criticism of 100 per cent candidate
Hughes, and his refusal to commit
himself by saying what he would have
done under similar circumstances.
The Aberdeen attorney covered almost
every issue raised or attempted to be
raised by the Standpatters in the
campaign, and in a masterly, augmen
tive manner showed the falsity or ab
surdity of every claim for a return
to power made by the party which
was so severely discredited four years
ago, and at the close was warmly ap
plauded by the audience.
town far distant from New York.
Some of the Republican leaders
doubt whether the plan can be used
at all. They regard this possibility
as lamentable for the reason that a
very fair-sized share of campaign
funds has already been paid Mr. Reid.
Vance McCormick, chairman of the
Democratic national committee, had
this to say:
"I cannot believe it possible that
any political party is going to attempt
to drag an issue of that kind into this,
campaign."
The man who portrayed Mr. Wilson
was George W. Johnson, captain ia
the Thirteenth coast defense. Nation*
al guard, New York. He said:
"If I had known that the film was
to be used for political purposes I
never would have taken part. I did
not know what kind of a play it was»
But Mr. Reid gave no impression L
was portraying the President doing a
day's work. I'd like to tell him what
I think of him."
Hal Reid, with whom the Republican
committee has made the contract for
j the photoplay production, was sen
tenced years ago to 15 years in prison
for an assault on a variety actress
named Maud Compton. He served IS
months in the Stillwater penitentiary,,
then he was pardoned by Governor
Merrlam. <
Last night Reid was asked abovt
this. "That is true," he said, "but I
have transcript of the pardon in whielt
the governor states, 'I And that a great.
Injustice has been done the said JL.
Hal Reid and that he la not guilty."**
The pardon was granted, it was an
nounced at the time, as the result of
affidavits by the Compton woman and.
others. Those affidavits were not.
made public.
CAPTAIN HOOK
IS DISMISSED
Long Time Member of Police
Force Is Turned Down in
Mysterious Manner.
Captain C. H. Hook, who had served
eight years on the Aberdeen police
force, for the past year as captain,
was dismissed Wednesday afternoon
by Chief Schmidt, who first demanded
Hook's resignation, and which was re
fused. After the council meeting Wed
nesday night, the police committee met
with Chief Schmidt and Hook, at the
request of the latter, to Investigate
the matter. When demanding Hook's
resignation the chief said there were,
rumors of grafting by the captain,
which, he said, he did not believe, befc
wanted the resignation. To this, Hook.
Jemurred, saying that to resign wonW
be an admission of the truth of the
rumors and a reflection upon ***»
character that he would not anb»
mlt to.
The police committee Informed Hoefc
that they knew of nothing derogatory,
to his character, and placed no belta(
in the rumors referred to, but TtR
inclined to criticize him for leniency
to drunks here during the Elks cafe
vent ion . To this. Hook replied that,
he had consulted with the mayor aa to
the action to take at that time, and
said, he was told by the mayor to act
just as he did. He also stated that,
he had requested the mayor to
present at this meeting of the com
mittee to bear him out in that state
ment, but the mayor did not appear.
After the hearing. Hook turned In h!s
police equipment, and Is still
ing, as are his friends, just what the
sudden move means.
It is said that neither the
mayor or police committee have au
thority under the law to dismisß a
member of the police force, that tte
statutes require the mayor to hav*
the consent of six members of ttui
council before such dismissal, or nine
councilmen, without the mayor muj

Captain Hook will take Is not knowiL.
