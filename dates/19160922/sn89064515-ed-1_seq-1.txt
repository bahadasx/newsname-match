CIVIC LEAGUE TO RAISE FUNDS
FOB RELIEF WORE—HAS A
FINE RECORD
Saturday, September 30, is official
Civic League Tag Day and on that day
the members of the league will be on
nearly every street corner down town,
tagging the passersby, in an effort to
Taise funds with which to carry on
the work during the coming year. The
people will be at liberty to givs any
amount they wish. In this manner the
league hopes to be able to raise from
$400 to $500, which will put the treas
ury in very good shape. The particu
lar date on which the tag sale will be
lield has been designated by the mayor
cuid approved by che city council* and
it will be held each year on that date.
The Civic League, since its organiza
tion, a few years ago, has done much
good in this city ana its nelping hand
lias also been extended to territory out
side of the city. Most of the work is
done without publicity and for this
reason perhaps few people actually
realize what the organization means to
this city. It has been estimated that
the league actually saved the city of
Little Falls sixteen hundred dbllars
dining 1915.
The work of the league brings it in
touch with every conceivable sort of
Teliet' work sucn us looking after de
pendents. caring for sick, bringing re
lief to crippled and indigent children,
supplying the penniless with food and
clothing, and in numerous other ways.
Mrs. F. G. Ruth, who has had chargt
of the settlement work of the league
for some time, cited at least two
score instances in Avhich the league has
been of great assistance in this city. In
numerous eases where people were in
dire •circumstances and even had be
come city charges, the league helpeci
them with food, clothing and: fuel, and
succeeded in getting relatives to take
care of several of them, thus relieving
the city and the community of a bur
den. The league members have seen
to it that in many of the homes of the
poor at Christmas they have had what
t-ould bp called a real Christmas. Sev
eral persons who were critically ill
•have been transferred to hospitals and
a part, and in some instances, the en
tire cost was borne by the league,
FOOIBAU GAME
ij.
.HIGH SQUAD TO TACKLE ALUMNI
IN OPENING GAME AT THE
v. FAIR GROUNDS
Tomorrow afternoon, at the fair
grounds, the local high school football
team will open its season with a game
-with a team composed of the local high
school alumni, under Fr. C. H. Longley.
TAG DAY SEPTEMBER 30 SUITERS PARALYTIC STROKE
A.
number of widows with dependent
••children have been assisted in getting
the widow's pension, several children
who were crippieu^ deformed or men
tally defective, have been sent to state
and other charitable institutions and
some of them have returned home cur
ed. Every week the members are call
ed upon for smaller favors such as
sendiftg someone to care for the chil
dren in a home for a short time, etc.
The league's work has grown so that
some sort of conveyance should be pro
vided for the workers. In the past
they have had to walk to the different
places, and where a conveyance was
necessary, the cost was for the most
part, paid out of the league treasury,
which the league does not like to do,
as it feels that this money should be
spent in actual relief work.
The high school ooys have the advan
tage ovt-r the alumni in that they have
been pra-ticing but the alumni on the
other hand are supposed to be so much
better Mayers so that it is predicted,
that the yame will be a close one.
Among those who will likely play on
the high school team are Sims, Levin,
..^DobbyL. Tanner, Grimes, Richard, Bas
tien, H^Mien, Elvig and several others
who ha*--' been trying out.
Longley has on his list Belanger,
Graham, Meyers. Canova and Joe
Tomeity. Eari Gordon, Robert Wands,
Inger Johnson, Robert Richard, Her
man Tanner, Steven Simonet, his
•brother Lawrence and himself.
