The following is the statemi

"Mr. Chairman and Members of
State Democratic Executive Conin
tee of South Carolina:
"Theie is only one party in
State of South Carolina, and t
party has adopted the primary me
od of nominating its officers. In t
State a nomination in the primi
is equivalent to an election. It is i
portant, therefore, that the cond
of primary elections should be f

white man may continue- to be i

estly done.'
Richey Alleges Fraud.

These affidavits and letters are 1

evidence, and it has produced the
pression on my mind (and I am c

upon the unbiased mind of any r
of ordinary reason) that no confidt
can be placed in the result of the e

and for the reason which I have ah
stated?to protect the integrity of
Democratic primary, and to presc
the unity of the white people of
State, and in the interest of jus

was not a contest before the committer
tee, but that each member had a right
? to state his reasons for voting for or
" against the report by the special
! committee. The Blease supporters on
the committee said that, for the reasons
set out in the Richey statement,
they would vote against the nomination
of Mr. Manning.
Several minor contests were
brought before the committee. It
ay was charged that the managers had
allowed a ballot to be taken from the
L'x" Estill box in Hampton county which
)0" had been voted wrong. It was pointed
out that the throwing out of the
im" box would affect only one race, that

demned the action of the managers in
as allowing a ballot box to be opened
and sustained by a vote of 18 to 9,
ace the Hampton committee in not throwng'
ing out the box. The appeal of S.

oner of McCormick cbunty, who

the second race, had failed to file in

TILLMAN COMMl
OF GOVERN
Senator Tillman's comments, which 1
are printed practically complete, are
as follows:
To the People of South Carolina:
"The election is over. Manning is
renominated, and Blease has missed
the third term he coveted so much. I
hope that I will not be misunderstood
if, as your old and trusted servant, I
make a few observations and give
some advice.
"There are approximately 65,000
South Carolinians who wanted Blease
for their governor despite his record,
ami I am convinced that 45,000, or ,
more ,of these voters are good men
and true. They voted for Blease because
they honestly believed he was
the better of the two candidates. I :
know they were mistaken, woefully
mistaken, but they would have been i
recreant in their duty to the State had ;
they not voted as their consciences
dictated. There are too many voters
not alive to their duty as citizens, and 1
they were easily misled by a selfish i
demagogue. Lack of thought, not vie- <
iousness, was responsible for the hold i
that Blease got on the people. They
did not stop to analye the difference ]
between demagoguery and statesman- I
ship. Being honest and straightfor- i
ward themselves, they did not suspect ]
Blease. His striking peronality, his 1
genius for organization were too much 1
for them. When he proclaimed him- |
self the heir of Tillman and the Re- 3
form movement, these 45,000 good 1
men took him at his word and fol- 1
lowed him. History is full of like in- 1
stances. j
"It grieved me to see so many of ]
my old friends bamboozled by Blease, 1
but I know their hearts are right and \
that in time they will see the difference
between true Tillmanism and 1
false?the kind that Blease teaches. ]
,The old reformers were blinded and <
misled, but, at the same time, their ]
ardent and unselfish support of what 1
ardent and unselfish support of what
they thought were the principles <
taught them long ago, excited my ad- 1
miration, respect and affection. In j
their splendid loyalty to true Demo- 1
cracy as they see it lies at once the 1
promise and the hope of good govern - ]
ment in South Carolina. Let a real j
.statesman arise, and these men will be j
even more loyal to him than they 1
were to Blease?and as they alway3 1
were to me. 1
"For Blease himself and his chie?. 1
lieutenants, I have nothing but acrr,.
and contempt. McLaurin, Talbert,
Browning and others of their l:ind !
krew in their hearts that Blease was i
thoroughly bad, but they followed *
him because they thought they could :
thus further their own selfish ends.
They believe it was a "ground swell"
like that in 1890, and wanted to get on
the "band wagon,' as so many men
did then?"driftwood," I called them,
you remember, and these men?like
sneakthieves?sought to take advantage
of the darkness. McLaurin is
the ablest, most loyal, and most hypoU.

NTS ON RESULT
PITS RACE
critical of the sorry lot. Think of it
He * had the effrontery to stand
up and say he was flprhtinj* for the
people to whom he was a better friend
than Tillman!
'"Now that the election is over,, look
calmly down into your own hearts?
I (am speaking to the 45,000 patriotic
Biease men?and see if your position
was well taken. The heat of the
conflict is past, and you can now see
clearly. Ask yourselves?nobody need
kaow you are doing it?why all the
tih-horn gamblers, all the blind tigers,
and the red light habitures, all the
criminals and near criminals?those
who have been pardoned and those
not yet caught and convicted?were
for Rlease. What have you in common
with these men, these vicious parasites
orwthe body politic. Nothing; Tor
you are good men and they are bad.
"There are those who have said that
the Reform Movement was responsible
for Bleaseism. I, as leader and
organizer of that revolution, deny the
charge. The reform movement bad
certain definite, constructive aims in
vitew. (1) To teach the people the
pdwer of the ballot and thus free the
Stjatc from an oligarchy which had
ruled it for a hundred years; (2) To
provide means for educating the enlarged
electorate; (3) To safeguard
the State, as far as possible, from negro
participation in politics. "By their
fruits ye 3hall know them." I point
to the nrimarv cvctom nf
K J wjowi Wl CICVUOII, IU
Clemson and Winthrop colleges, and
to the constitution of 1895 as the fulfillment
of the purposes of the Reform
Movement. The positiveness of 1890
never could have produced the negation
of 1910 and 1912.
"He who charges that Tillmanism
gave legitimate birth to Bleaseism expresses
his own disbelief in democracy.
The Reform Movement made the
people of the State free political
Igents. Will anybody dare deny that
hat was a good thing? "Government
derives its just powers from the consent
of the governed." Tillmanism
jave the ballot to the people and '
taught them its potency?which all
democrats must admit was right and
proper; it is not responsible for the
pi:4fcken use of a rightful power. 1
rm a democrat, and the defeat of
Rlease in 1914 and 1916 renews my
faith in the people. If the Reform
Movement elected Blease, what defeated
him?
"I am growing old, and before I die
1 would like to see the neople of
South Carolina forget their differences
ind bury factionalism. Factions are
the result of misunderstandings and
social injustice. Let all the people?
Bleaseites and anti-Bleaseites?come
together in a spirit of mutual helpfulness,
clearing up the misunderstandings
and working together to remedy
the injustices that are but too many.
The vast majority of both factions -
thank God?are honest men, and
surely honest men can find common
ground to stand on."

JOSEPH SAND
DIEl
I)EjWH of capt. thorp.
Died Wednesday Night at His Honv
Near the Town of Whitmire.
Whitmire, Sept. 17.?"Capt. Thorj
is dead! I'm so sorry. He was a fin<
man.
These expressions were heard 01
our streets Thursday morning; spok
em with a sadness and genuine sor
row not common at the death of on<
without any ties of kinship here.
Capt. Thomas Lee Thorp was ai
Englishman. Before coming to Amer
ica he was for several years thi
youngest captain in the English army
Most of his military service was ii
India.
Many years ago Capt. Thorp mar
ried Miss Ada Steadman, the daugh
ter of Major J. B. Steadman, a prom
inent lawyer of Union, S. C. She has
been dead about 25 years .leaving a
son who, after being educated in this
country, went to Australia, and is employed
by the government of thai
country. No other children survive.
Capt. Thorp died on his farm twc
and one-half miles from here, in
Union county, Wednesday night, September
13th, at 11 o'clock. His body
was sent to Virginia for burial, neai
Washington. For several months he
had been under the skilful treatment
of Dr. J. H. Moore for Bright's disease.
Not until a week before hi?
death was he confined to his bed. Capt
Thorp knew his end was fast approaching
long before it came, and
often spoke of his approaching death
as calmly and coolly as of any othei
matter, ne aiea without fear, surrounded
by loving friends and neighbors
who gave him every attention
and comfort possible.
Capt. Thorp was a rare man. His
heart was full to overflowing of tht,
milk of human kindness; he was as
polite as Chesterfield; of unusual refinement,
and as gentle and tender
as a woman?always considerate of
others in every walk of life. One
could not help but admire him.
Shakespeare tells us, "The evil men
do lives after them; the good is oft
interred with their bones," and that
life is "a mingled yarn, good and ill
together." Capt. Thorp's life seems
to have had the evil eliminated, leaving
only the threads of pure gold. Certainly
we will remember no evil of
him; but his fine character and lovable
nature will live in the memory
of his Carolina friends ,of his Virginia
relatives and his English acquaintances.
He was not afraid to die. Why
should any one be? He fought bravely
the battles of life, ran his race am
entered the valley of the shadow ol
death without fear or trembling
There is not a man, woman or chile
in Whitmire but mourns his "taking
off" and would welcome him bad
with open arms from "that bourne
from which no traveler returns.'
Those among whom he has livee' ant
mmro/1 ho/1 h I.. 1 r
...?tvu anu nau ins ucin^ ior manj
long years held him in the very high
est esteem and feel they "sfyall no
see his like again."
Farewell, a long fi.rewell, to Capt
Thomas Lee Thorp! May his spirit
like his body, rest in peace, is th<
hope of all who knew him.?Newberrj

owing to failing health.
1 Mr. Sanders was a faithful deacon
of the Westside Baptist church and
1 "hs interested in all the work of the
' church. He was for many years a
teacher in the Sunday school there.
Everybody held Joseph Sanders in
| high esteem, for he was kind and considerate
of the feelings of both friend
and foe. There was no bitterness in
him. He was upright in life and held
the esteem of all who knew him.
The burial was conducted by Rev.
J. B. Boaeman, hi? pastor, assisted by-* ' *
1 Rev. G^o. P. White, and the interment
was in Gilead cemetery at Jonesville.
