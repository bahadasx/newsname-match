• After a steady growth during the
first few nights of practice, Coach
Dietz's W. S. C. football squad by
Thursday evening had assumed
promising proportions, 38 men re
sponding to the call of the coaches
last night. Of this number 12 were
members of last year's squad, the
balance being new men of high
school experience, many of whom
show considerable promise. The old
men back In the game include
Bangs (Capt.), R. Boone, Basil
Doane, Richard Hanley, Arthur Dur
ham, Jack Finney, Silas Stites, Ray
Loomls. Clarence Boone, R. Brooks,
W. Berried and L. Hanley. Lang
don, star center last year, who joined
Uncle Sam's forces at the Mexican
border, was in town last week and
enrolled, returning to his company
at American Lake Monday. Lang
don was accompanied by Brlley, a
Lewis and Clark fullback, who also
entered his name on the W. S. C.
lists. The two men expect to be
mastered out by the first of the
month, when they will rejoin the
squad. Langdon's worth is known
and he will be welcomed back to the
squad. Briley also is a man of much
football ability and is expected to
make a strong bid for the back
field position.
P. Fishback, a valued member of
last year's squad, is back in school,
but is ill and may not be out with
the squad for several days. D. M.
. Bartow, another of last year's men
of whom much was expected this
year, is suffering from typhoid fever
at his home in Vancouver, Wash.,
and will not play this year. Clar
ence Zimmerman, last year's star
end, probably is lost to the team
through inability to return to school,
but may yet decide to enroll. King
also will be out of the game.
! With a dozen and possibly more
letter men around whom to build a
team, the chances for another cham
pionship for W. S. C. look fairly
?ood, although the caliber of the
new men has been given no definite
test.
Of the new men, Brown of Boise,
Idaho, candidate for quarter, is
among the most promising. Brown
Played three years with the Boise
.high school team, serving his team
** captain, and last year was cap
| ton of the Freshman team at the
University of Wisconsin, where he
established a favorable record. He
*Udles himself well in early prac

HUGE PROFITS IN
FEEDING PORKERS
I
Orin Little, Eleven- Year-old Hoy,
Realizes Net Profit of $127 on
Two Pigs, Prize Winners
al Exhibit
The sale of the two prize winning
grade pigs exhibited at the' Whitman
county boys' and girls' exhibit here
last Saturday by Orin Little, 11-year
old son of Elmer Little, the well
known farmer, proved the climax to
j a mute but highly interesting story
! which proves conclusively that huge
I profits are to be secured through the
careful feeding of porkers. Orin be
came interested in pig club work
last spring, and when a litter of 13
I grade pigs was born on the Little
| farm April 1 he asked the privilege
'of purchasing two of them so that
• he might try his hand at producing
j prize winners through careful feed
ing. His father did not care to sell
the boy the pigs, but an agreement
was reached whereby he was to give
the enthusiastic club member two of
the litter and was to receive $1.25
per hundredweight for all feed used.
Orin turned the two pigs in the
orchard and watched them closely,
feeding balanced rations and weigh
ing at frequent intervals to ascertain
the growth of the porkers. The other
members of the pig family were
turned out with the herd in the or
dinary way and permitted to root for
their existence. Soon the difference
in weight between the boy's pigs and
those owned by his father from ths
litter began to be noticeable and at
the time of the fair last Saturday
Orin's two porkers weighed. in at
230 pounds each, while his father's
tipped the beams at a scant 100
pounds, showing a difference of 130
pounds of weight per pig, the re
sult of youthful care and interest.
After cleaning up in the grade pig
division at the exhibit, winning both
first and second places, the boy dis
posed of his two champions, receiv
ing nine cents per pound, or $41.40
for the two pigs. The total cost of
the feed used in producing the prize
winners, at $1.25 per hundred
weight, was $14. giving the boy a
net profit of over $27 besides the
1 prize money and the honor attached
j to his signal victory.
The boy la enthusiastic over his
highly successful enterprise and
promises next year to produce' a
bunch of pigs that will eclipse his
effort of this year.

Hundreds of visitors were attract
ed to the exhibit on Saturday and the
excellent work of the boys and girls
interested in the national club move
ment was the object of much favor
able comment. The canning contest
was by far the biggest attraction of
the exhibit and many onlookers
watched the six teams, representing
different parts of the county, turn
out cans of peaches, tomatoes and
beans that would arouse envy in the
heart of the most proficient house
wife. Second place in this contest
went to a team of Garfield girls, In
cluding Maude Ferrish, Floy Doug

and swine, the contest being judged
by Prof, William Hislop. The ages
of the boys ranged from 12 to 17
years, and competition was keen.
The exhibits of the Garfield boys
and girls were comprehensive and at
tracted much attention. A model set
of dairy buildings, the work of stu
dents of the Garfield schools, was the
center of attraction. The members
of the winning canning team from
Johnson are students of Mrs. Leah
Griffin, formerly Leah Bean of Pull
man, who took just pride in the work
of her proteges. The young ladies,
together with the other three trip
winners, left for North Yakima Tues
day, in charge of Bruce Lampson of

were chaperoned by Mrs. W. D.

WHITMAN' COUNTY
A HEALTHY PLACE
That Whitman county's population
• is increasing by leaps and bounds
i through births in excess of deaths is
proved by the September report of
the Washington State Board of
j Health, which includes the vital sta
tistics for the different, towns of
Whitman county. In the entire
, county, with four districts not re
, ported, 67 births were recorded,
while the death list was only 21, or
an increase In population of 46
throng" this means. While the Pull
man city district is not reported, the
rural district shows six births and
no 'deaths, the best record made- by
any district In the' county. St. John
and Rosalia show nine births and one
'death each, while LaCrosse reported
| eight births and one death. Tekoa
j shows five births and two deaths,
Endicott. five births and no death:*,
Garfield four and three. Thornton

three, Farmington and Palousj rural
I three and one, Oakesdale' two and

Colfax was the only town In the
county to show an excess of deaths

NUMBER 49
MAY DEVELOP POWER
FROM SNAKE RIVER
Pullman Chamber Will Place Isata
in Hands of Government Invest I
gtttCH-S PoMibiljties for
Elect Power
With a view to interesting capital
in the development of 'the ilateut
power of the Snake river, the Pull
man Charmer of Commerce, through
a committee appointed to: that pur
pose, will place in the hands of a
party of government engineers who
will next week investigate the pos
sibilities of the Snake tor power pur
poses, all available data concerning
the nullity and will present the en
gineers with an outline of the possi
bilities of such development. The
local committee will co-operate with
the Lewiston Chamber of Commerce
and like organizations from other
towns Interested in the project, an
it is probable that delegate* will he
sent to impress upon the engineers
the need of Snake river power de
velopment and. the. wide scope of the
benefits that would follow. |
The matter was culled te) the at
tention of the Pullman chamber at
its Tuesday noon session by J. M.
Reid, whose plan at once struck a re
sponsive chord and resulte 1 In the
appointment of the committee., with
lull power to take such action as is
deemed necessary, The Lewiston
people are very active In the matter
and every effort will be mad i to fa
vorably impress Uncle Sams expert
investigators, it being believed that
a favorable report, accompanied by
the necessary data, will go a long
way toward enlisting capital in the
development of the Snake river.
Whitman, Garfield, Columbia and
Asotin counties in Washington and
Nez Perce and Latah counties in
Idaho are vitally Interested in the
nature of the report submitted and
each county will do its part toward
accomplishing the desired end. it Is
expected that the engineers will
reach Lewiston next Monday, but
their arrival may be delayed a few
days.
Upon Mr. Reld's suggestion the
data to be placed In the hands of the
engineers Include the number of
acres In cultivation in each county
interested, the nature and amounts
of the various products typical of
each county, the number of towns
and the population of each. The fact
that the Snake river is the natural
drainage, for the vast area of con
tinguous territory and therefore the
natural and proper outlet for ti as
portation will be called to .he at
tention of the Investigating parly.
The undeveloped condition of our
manufactories, and the great scope
of the possibilities In this line with
available electric power at reason
able rates will be mentioned, as will
also the possibilities for the installa
tion of electric roads as feeders for
river transportation and other roads
throughout the adjacent country.
The Whitman county figures will
show that of the 1,345,120 acres in
the county, 950,548 acres are Im
proved, while the unappropriated
and unreserved government lands
total 5107 acres. Farm lands con
stitute 88.1 per cent of the total
acreage, there being 3096 different
farms, of an average of 383.7 acres.
The population of the county Is ap
proximately 40,000, and farm lands,
improved, are worth from $40 to
$100 the acre. The average precipi
tation throughout the county Is close
to 20 Inches and the average mean
temperature is 47 degres.
Eighty-five per cast of the total
acreage has been proven ideal for
grain growing, and Whitman county
leads the world In grain production,
the annual crop being a/ound the
15, 1,000 bushels mark. The county
assessor estimates the annual pro
duction of wheat as 9,704,000
bushels, of oats 3,514,100 and bar
ley 1,072,230. Fruit and vegetable
raising, dairying and stock raising
are also important Whitman county
industries.
Jasper LaFollette returned to Pull
man last week and enrolled at the
State College. Monday he went back
to American lake to remain until the
National Guard company in which he
enlisted, is mustered out of service.
He expects to be able to begin his
college work about October 1.
