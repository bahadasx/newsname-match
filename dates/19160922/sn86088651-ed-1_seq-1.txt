London, Sept. 22. The German In
fantry advancing In waves made re
newed efforts to regain lost positions
from the French north of the 8omme
river, but the attacks were broken
by the artillery, the Germans losing
heavily, says the French official
statement. Paris also reports the
French and 8erblan troops on the
western end of the Macedonian front
scored new successes against the
Bulgarians.
The 8erblans continue advancing
along the Broda river near Urblna,
where a hundred prisoners" were
taken. ,
The British war ship bombarded
the Bulgarian positions on the east
bank of the Struma northeast of 8a
lonlkl, and In the Dolran region an
artillery duel of great intensity la in
progreis, according to the London
statement
The British advanced on a front of
about a mile last night in the 8omme
sector, south of Anere river, and cap
tured two lines of hostile trenches,
says the British war office.
The tide of the great battle In the
Rumanian province of Dobrudja has
turned in favor of the Central powers
and Von Mackensen's troops have
succeeded In breaking the Rumanian
Russian resistance and are executing
an encircling movement which com
pelled the entente forces to retreat In
disorder, according to Berlin. It was
reported last night the Cermans and
Bulgarians had been defeated and
were retreating southward. If the
German victory proves decisive the
situation will be serious for the Ru
manians, who have been fighting to
protect the railroad from Constanza
on the Black Sea to Chernavoda on
the Danube. . .
