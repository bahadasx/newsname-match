ELEGTRiG LIGHTS SURE
Work Begun On West End Line
v Complete In November '
'"; .. Push Work
' The Electric Light and power
, line from Brunswick; is now in
course of construction and work
haft begun at the Brunswick end
of the line and the big' supply
bouse which has been at Marcel
ine will be moved - here about
Octocer 1st (o 5th. -,
The delay or rather further
delay in the beginning of the
construction of the line and
plant here was occasioned by th
action of the Public Service Com
mission which Anally gave per
mission to put in the plant under
the charter granted by the peo
ple of this ci'y Saturday. The
commission is slow to permit
" competing public service institu
tions for the reason that both may
' go down and the public be left
with nothing,,- The acetylene
'. plant here was given an oppor
tunity to show why an electric
line should not be constructed
and J. W. Taylor, its owner, de
dined to enter objection and the
Commission , promptly granted
permission to manager Nickeli
Saturday to go ahead and he be
gun again to rush the work of
getting in the line and the sup
ply depot for wiring the city.
' The big supply house which
has been at Marceline will be
moved here along about the first
of October and the putting in fix
tures in business and other houses
, will be begun at once and it is
expected that light and power
wilt be supplied to all who desire
-it and not later than November
. 15th. c
No Prohibition Amendment
Secretary of State Cornelius
Roach has notified prohibition
leaders that he will not have the
amendment they go up printed
on the ballot to be voted in No
vember His reason is that it conflicts
with the Constitution of the
United' States and the prerog
atives of Congress.
It is likely that a mandamus
will be issued and the opinion ot
the Supreme Court sought in an
undertaking to force the Secre
tary to submit the amendment
to the people.
Secretary Roach holds that if
the amendment as gotten up is
no good, there is no use wasting
time and money by putting if on
the ballot

Honey Hunters
Manager Washam of our high
school building assembled teach
ers and several others Saturday
afternoon and went to the woods
on a hunt for a bee tre. Of
course Bert knew all the time
the exact spot where the tree
could be found but the others
hunted straight for it with him
for guide. , Lunch, then wading
into the tree with axes. The
top was but a shell and when the
tree hit the ground it shattered
and scattered about a half bar
rel of honey and como about
over the ground, but about a half
barrel was taken from the tree
just the same. Coons are gett
ing about ripe enough for Wor
sham to set the teachers on their
trail.

the oldest residents of the county

friends began to arrive in the
afternoon until sixteen had as
sembled at her old home, she was
overcome with genuine pleasure.
A dinner after the style of the
famous cook who had prepared
and sarved so many in entertain
ment of her friends during her
long, active life, was served at
four in the afternoon, and a real
old-time sociable event closed all
too soon for the aged hostess.
Numerous souvenirs were brot;
by the guests and they will
serve to keep in fading memory
the life-long friendship of the
givers. Her daughters, Mrs B
D. Kribben of St. Louis and Mrs.
Bert Lewis of Omaha and grand
children, reminded her in ad
vance of tne coming event oy
sending huge baskets of fruit
and toggery. t

Mrs. Kt-llogg present were: Mr
W. W. Rucker. Mrs. John Gas-
ton, ; Mrs. H. C Uinter. - Mrs -Robert

THE EUROPEAH WAR
Austrians Gain in the East
Allies Checked in France
New War Gun
The Austro-German forces
have routed the Roumanians and
more than recovered lost ground.
Allies introduced new machine
in the form of an armored car
with machine guns and did much
toward emptying trenches occu
pied by Germans until they got
used to it.
Both armies doing little in
France and predictions that the
Germans would be driven from
France appear to have been pre
