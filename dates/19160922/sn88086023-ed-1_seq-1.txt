HODGEN WILL RUN
AS INDEPENDENT
I.ouis Hodgen of Free water
will be upon the ballot this fall
as candidate for tlie legislature
as an independent candidate from
the east end of the county.
Yesterday Hod gen was refused
a place on the ballot as a demo
iTatic nominee because of a rul
ing of the supreme court that a
central committee cannot fill a
vacancy. However It is still pos
sible for an Independent candi
date to get noon the ballot and
friends of the east end man say
today Unit he will be so listed.
It Is necessary to circulate a
petition and have tho same filed
by September 25 in order to get
Ilndgcn In the running.
The news that Mr. Hodgcn will
run as an lndi-endent candidate
has caused much favorable com
ment today as there was regret
over the seeming fact that his
name could not appear.. He will
have strong support from the east
end of the county.
WON'T MISS A BIT OF

"Great, can't mtss a bit of It,''
said Louis J. Hill this morning
after witnessing the morning 4)
show with his family at the
Round-Up- The Hills drove up
In their automobile following
the performance and purchased
red and blue banderos for each
member of the family. So eager
were they to see the whole 4
show that they took a little

The cloudy canopy of morning hav
ing given away to clear skies and with
a welcome coolness in the light breeze
blowing, the second day of the 191C
Round-Up opened at 1:S0 this after
noon with an attendance In grand
stand and bleachers that will total
right around the 15,000 mark, about
such an attendance as was presented
at the final day a year ago.
The show itself, as well as the at
tendance, has every promise of
eclipsing the brilliant exhibition ot
yesterday. There Is a punch to the
program and the croWd is in a most
responsive spirit.
The first emotion of the crowd was
of amusement, occasioned by the an
tics of the bucking burros and bulls.
Old Champion Sharkey was saddled
but waited vainly for a rider to
mount him. None of the cowboys fan
cied the hard fall that was Inevitable.
Cowimny Race Thrills.
The first of the racing events, the
rough and ready cowpony race, was
thrilling enough to satisfy any crowd.
Hoy Feebler took a big lead from the
start nnd held it for more than a lap
and a half when Scoop Martin, who
had been back in the bunch of ten,
pulled up rapidly and Just at the fin
ish line pulled ahead of Feebler and
crossed a nose ahead.
The dust of this race had not settled
before five brightly dressed Indian
maidens dashed up to the judces stand
and were off in the spectacular squaw
race. The crowd found Its voice to
cheer on these dusky contestants.
Cowgirls' standing Race,
Bertha Plancett, who won the cow
girls' standing race yesterday, could
rot keep her feet on her spirited sor
rels today and had to content herself
with second money to Josephine
Robes.
Cowboys' Relay Race.
Allan Drumheller, winner of the re
lay yesterday, was given a ringing
cheer when he rode up to the mark
this afternoon. He responded by du
plicating his victory of yesterday. Bill
Abott. Instead of Dwlght Zedicar, rode
the Boise polo string today and fin
ished with a lead at the end of the
first relay. However, his horse over
ran and he was put far into the rear
on his second mount. Drumheller was
off first after the first change and
was closely followed by Bob Leihe.
THRONGS STILL POUR IN

Bulldogging a Winner.
The bulldogging event today
brought the grandstand to its feet for
there were several man-brute wrest
ling matches that were everything a
red-blooded spectator could desire
Sammy Garrett was first to pit him
self against a long horn. He caught
the animal at the east, turn and turn
ed it off its feet Just 3i 2-S seconds
after the first crack of the pistol.
I Mike Hastings Improved upon this
time but unfortunately his chances ot

mal fought him stubbornly Just in

was 43 3-5.
Dell Blancett made a gallant try
for record time, swinging from his

His hold was broken, however, ai.

Cowgirls' Bucking Contest.
The cowgirls bucking contest saw
