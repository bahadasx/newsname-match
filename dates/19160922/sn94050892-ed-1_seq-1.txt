tered the standing of the candidates.

BUSINESS DEALS
IN CLIFTON
MANY
Several Realty and Business Deals
Have Been Consummated in Last
Two Weeks
Several business transactions of im
portance have been consummated in
Mifton during the past two weeks
whereby considerable (property has
changed hands. Last week a deal
was concluded in which the Clifton
School district purchased the proper
ty of C. W. Young on Chase Creek,
formerly occupied as a corral and
transfer. The buildings will be razed
and the grounds improved and a play
ground made for the children of the
Chase Creek school.
Mr. Young in turn purchased the
lot and building owned by George Web
ster in South Clifton and occupied by
the Merrill Transfer. He also bought
the entire transfer business of H. M.
Merrill, which included all the live
stock, wagons, etc., and will in the
future conduct the business from his
new location.
To keep the ball roni0 merriil &
Hoyt this week purchased the Gen
Billiard Hall from Wright & Swift and
will take possession of the new busi
ness the first of the week. Messrs.
Merrill and Hoyt, the new owners,
are contemplating several changes in
the interior of the building which will
greatly improve its appearance as well
as giving a new line of sport to the
patrons of this popular resort. The
interior will be repainted and decor
ated in lighter colors, two new sky
lights will be put In in the large ante
room for the convenience of the pa
trons at the reading and card tables
and two new bowling alleys will be
built in the rear of the building.
These alleys will extend from the
main building across the rear of the
Fashion Barber Shop and when com
pleted will be one of the best alleys
in the state, as no expense will be
spared in their construction. It is
the intention of the management to
arrange for pool and bowling tourna
ments during ' the coming winter
months and under the progressive
management of Merrill & Hoyt the
Gem will no doubt be the center of
attraction for those enjoying these
lines of entertainment.
In order not to be left out in the
cold S. C. Swift closed a deal where
by he becomes one-third owner of the
Elrage ranch near Sunset and will be
come a full fledged cowpuncher at odd

MONKEYS ON WAY TO SAVE IN
FANTS FROM PARALYSIS
RICH COUNTRY TO
BE TAPPED
BY RAIL
Proposed Road Will Open a Splendid
Vista Between Clarkdale and Mesa.
San Francisco, Sept. 16 Fifty
monkeys from the Orient were start
ed east today for use qf the Rocke
feller institute in connection with the
infantile paralysis epidemic. The
shipment contained a hundred, but
for'y died from lung trouble.
How needlessly explicit are the
signboard in the dry states that bear
the words "Soft Drinks" as if they
could be anything but soft.
This morning Attorney xioyle and
Pickett of Tombstone filed with John
" J. Birdno, receiver of the United
. States land office, the papers covering
the location of a railway line from
Clarkdale to Mesa. The filing was
I made on behalf of the Arizona Exten
I sion Railroad company and the de
tailed map of the location will be filed
later in the week. The line is iw
miles in length and will follow the
course of the Verde river from its
starting point at Clarkdale to the
Granite Reef dam.
The attorneys stated that a survey
party will be put in the field this
week.
One step towards the main line rail
road which "Phoenix must and will
have" has been taken in the filing of
the articles of incorporation of the
Arizona Extension Railroad company.
This concern, headed by James S.
Douglas, president of the United
Verde Extension Mining company, and
including in its list of directors many
of the most prominent mining men of
the state, will build a road from Clark
dale to Mesa, connecting there with
the Arizona Eastern and later with
the Tucson, Phoenix & Tidewater
when that road shall be completed.
I The road is capitalized at $4,000,000
land it i3 understood that work is plan
ned to be besun in the near future.
1 The route will follow the Verde river
I to its junction with the Salt at Gran
ite Ree At this point a bridge will
.be bui: ifording access to Mesa.
I The -id will tap one of the
! richest ...iing districts of the state
'and its luii'tliTirT will bri"r prosperity
to hundreds of mines and prospects
which have been incapable of proper
development owing to the absence of
railroad facilities.
The coming of the road will mean
an unprecedented prosperity for the
northern mines and miners, and as
well as the opening of a great market
to the farming and merchants of the
Salt River valley.
Along practically the entire right of
way there are possibilities in the way
of both agriculture and mining that
make the success of the completed line
assured. Along the Verde there are
already many partially developed irri
gation schemes and the furnishing of
a means of access to .markets will
work wonders in the development of
the country.
The directorate of the road Includes
in addition to James S. Dogulsa, Jas.
P. Boyle, E. O. Ellis, H. W. Williams
and S. P. Applewhite, the latter of
whom is secretary of the Douglas In
vestment company.
In addition to the line mentioned. It
is said that the old Navajo Southern
railroad project has been revived and
that it is planned to build a road from
Holbrook south to Pinetop. Such a
line will open another vast stretch of
valuable territory and will spell pros
perity for the farmers, the cattlemen
and the miners of the northern coun
try. Located In Venezuela

Howard C. Mix and James H. Ker
by were business visitors at Carlisle,
N. M. the first part of the week and
while there Mr. Mix entered into a
contract with the mining company at
that place to manage their commis
sary department. Mr. and Mrs.
Mix expect to leave for Carlisle in a
few days where they will reside for
the present while Mr. Mix takes up
his new duties.
Admiral Dewey's reassuring words
about the navy are all the more con
vincing in the light of the newly pass
ed navy bill.
The Copper Era today opens Ita
columns for the receipt of contribu
tions to Woodrow Wilson's campaign
fund.
Under authorization by the Demo
cratic National Committee, the Cop
per Era will undertake to raise a
fund to assist in meeting the ex
penses of the campaign. Contribu
tions, large and small, will be welcome
and will be acknowledged in the col
umns of this newspaper. Each con
tributor also will receive from Wilber
W. Marsh, Treasurer of the National
Committee, a handsome lithographed
receipt.
For the expenses of its national
campaign the Democratic party Is
dependent entirly upon popular contributions.
The party does not expect and
will not take money for its cam
paign fund from persons or corpora
tions with sinister purposes. It ab
hors the practice of catering to the
vested interests, and seeks its support
from the multitude.
Four years ago 89,854 Individual
contributions were received. The
managers of Mr. Wilson's campaign
want to raise that figure to more than
100,000 this year.
It was the money of the people that
paid the expenses of electing Mr. Wil
son in 1912. It is the people who
have been served during the three
years and a half of his administra
tion. It is your battle. Peace, prosperity,
justice and honor! These are the
blessings that Woodrow Wilson has
won for you; these are the blessings
that are at stake.
