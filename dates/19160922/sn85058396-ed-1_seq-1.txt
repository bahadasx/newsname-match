I Von Mackensen Turns Tide of J I
the Great Battle in Rumania I
Entente Forces Outflanked
i in Dobrudja and Forced
I , to Retreat in Disorder
!! The tide of great battle in the Ru-
roanian province of Dobrudja has
) again turned, this time in favor of the
central powers, according to Berlin
h 3 today. Field Marshal von Mackcn
& sen has succeeded in breaking the Ru
yi manian and Russian resistance, the
j German war office reports, executing
I ;i an encircling movement which com
j pelled the entente forces to retreat in
h j disorder.
It was only last night that an of
jij ficial announcement from Bucharest
I: declared that the battle, which had
' been in progress for six days, had
' ended "Wednesday with the defeat of
the Germans, Bulgarians and Turks
who were retiring southward, burning
j villages as they went.
If the German victory turns out to
j to a decisive one, the situation prom
ises to develop seriously for the Ru
inanlans and Russians, who have
been fighting to protect the railroad
running from Constanza, on the Black
sea, to Tchemavoda, on the Danube.
' The battle was fought not mroe than
I; 20 miles south of the railroad and
I its loss would mean the cutting of
i the convenient water route of com
munication between Russia and Ru
mania by way of Constanza. Through
,! Tchernavoda in addition lies the
route to interior Rumania over the
, only bridge spanning the Danube
:i along the entire Dobrudja front.
In the fighting in the Carpathians
j the Russians have taken the mountain
peak of Smotreo, which already had
i changed hands several times. Else-
where along this rugged front the
; Russians have been attacking heavily
but, according to Berlin, were beaten
) off.
; The British are again striking hard
ou the Somme front. Their latest
,' thrust, delivered last night, netted
i them two lines of German trenches on
1 a line about a mile long between Flers
; and Martinpulch, London announces
today. It is at this point that the
British have pushed farthest toward
Bapaume, which is but little more
than three miles distant from Flers.
Last night's advance straightens out
the former bend in the line from
J, Martinpulch to Flers, which now runs
J. almost directly east and west.
The French, for their part of the
i Somme fighting, have had another
series of German attacks to cope with.
Strong forces" advanced In waves this
morning against positions recently
captured by the French between Ran
court and "Priez farm. According to
Paris, the Germans did not even
' reach the French lines, being forced
back to their trenches with heavy
losses by the fire of the French guns.
Entente Drlvo Grows Stronger.
' On the Macedonian front in the
; region north of Fiorina, the entente
! drive towards Monastir apparently is
' developing strength. The Serbians
; are reported to be continuing their
advance on the Broda reaching a point
near Urban! (Vrbnl) eight miles north
' Monastir. Immediately northeast of
east of Fiorina on the railroad to
Monastir, the Bulgarians are making
a stand but, according to Paris, failed
in an attack upon French troops in
this region. To the west tho entento
forces are moving forward on the
heights towards PopllI, ten nines irom
Fiorina. , . ,.
Artillery fire of increasing Intensity
is reported from the British front in
the Doiran region. On the extreme
easterly end of the line British war
ships near the mouth of the Struma
. have been shelling Bulgarian positions
j( In the vicinity of Neohori.
British Advance on Somme Front.
London, Sept. 22, 2:15 p. m. The
1 British advanced on a front of about
a mile last night in the Somme sec
f lor, south of the Ancre river, "l he
i war office announced today that two
I lines of hostile trenches had been
f captured.
"During the night we advanced on a
f front of about a mile," the statement
i Bays, "capturing two lines of hostile
trenches, approximately between
Flers and Martinpulch. Our front
now runs approximately on a direct
f line north of Flers and Martinpulch.
"The enemy's trenches "were suc
cessfully entered last night south of
Arras, prisoners being taken and
manv casualties inflicted. North ot
Neuvllle-St, Vaast a mine was blown
up by us and the crater occupied.
Germans Forced to Retreat.
Paris, Sept. 22 Noon. German in
fantry advancing in waves made re-
newed efforts this morning to beat
back the French front positions re-
cently captured north of the Somme.
1 The official announcement of today
i says the attacks- were broken by
m French artillery .before the Germans
I reached the French1 lines, compelling
them to retire to their own trenches
i after sustaining heavy losses.
The attacks of the Germans made

French positions between Le Priez
farm and Rancourt.
The announcement follows:
"North of the river Somme German
forces this morning delivered a strong
attack upon our new positions, be
tween Le Priez farm and Rancourt.
Our curtain of fire, however, checked
sharply the assaulting waves of the
enemy and compelled them to retire
to the trenches whence they had start
ed, at the same time inflicting upon
them heavy losses.

HUGHES RUSHING
THR01IGHT0WNS
Republican Nominee Talks
Mostly on Tariff in Thirteen
Speeches Crowded Into
Day's Program.
Muncle, Ind., Sept. 22. Charles E.
Hughes' second day in Indiana was a
day of many short stops, whisking in-
to towns and out with station crowds,
brass bands, rear platform addresses
and hand shaking. Into the day's
program were crowded twelve short
speeches. The thirteenth will be de
livered at South Bend, his first stop.
At New Castle, the first stop, Mr.
Hughes spoke briefly on the tariff.
At Anderson where the special was
switched to another railroad line, the
nominee left the train and made a
sort talk at the courthouse. Repub
lican enthusiasts had brought to town
an old cannon that saw campaign
service in the days of Garfield and
this boomed out a deafening salute
as tho train stopped. The front of
the court house had been plastered
yesterday with Wilson and Marshall
posters, but they wero all torn down
early this morning and when the
nominee arrived tho front of the build
ing wbb covered with Hughes posters.
Raymond Robins, who was chair
man of the national convention, spoke
to the crowd, to tell them that Mr.
Hughes voice was poor and that he
had better not speak in the open air.
Tho crowd wanted to hear Hughes,
however, and shouted for him. The
nominee spoke for ten minutes, disre
garding signals from members of his
party to sit down.
At Muncie another crowd greeted
him. Mr. Hughes confined his short
talks mostly to the tariff.

VILLA RAID IS
NOT CONFIRMED
War Department Not Disposed
to Accept Account Trans
mitted to Bell as Ac
curate. . i
STORY BASED ON RUMOR
General Funston Instructed to
Submit Any Authentic News
That May Involve
Pershing.
Washington, Sept. 22. Secretary
Baker let it be known today that the
war department was not disposed to
accept as accurate the report of Vil
la's raid on Chihuahua City last Sat
urday transmitted by Brigadier-General
Bell yesterday, on the strength
of information that had reached him
In El Paso.
"We have no military information
as to renewed Villista activity," Mr.
Baker said, indicating that It was as
sumed that General Bell's account
was based upon rumors and reports
current in border towns and not facts
obtained through army channels in
Mexico. He declined to discuss in
any way what effect the re-appearance
of Villa, if It were confirmed,
might have upon the movement of
American troops in Mexico.
So far the war department has
made no effort to learn from what
source General Bell secured his infor
mation. General Funston has been
Instructed to transmit to the war de
partment any authentic news of the
bandits, upon which a change in plan
Involving General Pershing's expedi
tion might be founded.
Funston Believes Story.
San Antonio, Texas, Sept. 22. Gen
eral Fun3ton said today he placed full
credence in the report of Villa's at
tack on Chihuahua. City, sent to the
war department by Brigadier-General
George Bell, Jr., and given out for
publication yesterday.
He said he had been informed that
General Bell's information was gained
from reliable persons who had come
to El Paso directly from Chihuahua
City Immediately after the battle.
"General Bell's report was made up
from interviews had by officers of the
army intelligence department with
persons who fled from Chi
huahua City and was not based on
border rumors, I understand," said
General Funston.
"Of course the army had no repre
sentitives in Chihuahua and could not
get first hand details." ;
De Facto Reinforcements. !
There are now about 6000 de facto
government troops in Chihuahua City,
according to General Pershing. A
large percentage of these are rein
forcements rushed in from the south
since the battle, indicating that Tre
vino's force, prior to the attack, was
comparatively weak.
General Funston also explained an
announcement by Dr. P. J. Gambrell,
corresponding secretary of the Bap
tist General Convention of Texas at
Dallas last night, quoting General
Funston as ordering that Baptist
preachers might preach to the sol
diers, providing that they did not
tell them they were "lost."
General Funston said he had no de
sire to dictate to ministers what they
should preach to army men but he ob
jected to revivals being held in the
camps and found particularly obnox
ious any supposition that army men
need to be especial objects for evan
gelism. "We have a fine lot of men, equal
to any other class of men in the coun
try," he said. "I don't believe they
should be considered as being lost.'"
General Trevlno's Statement.
New York, Sept. 22 In a telegram
today to Juan T. Burns, Mexican consul-general
in New York. General Tre
vino after reiterating his statements
that his forces defeated tho Villa in
vaders at Chihuahua City, says:
"This foolish shedding of blood was
with the intention of creating diffi
culties for the conferees of tho com
mission at New London at tho ma
chinations of American and Mexican
political interests. They themselves
are now satisfied that they have
failed." j
J
Story Declared Untrue.
Chihuahua City, Mexico, Sept. 22.
Commenting on the report in Ameri
can newspapers, attributed to Brlga
dlerGcneral George Bell, Jr., at El
Pnso, Texas, of the Villa raid upon
this city last Saturday, General Ja
cinto Trcvlno, commanding the Car
ranza army of tho north, today issued
a statement to The Associated Press
In which ho described It as "a tissue
of lies and falsehoods."
"I am at a loss to know where
General Bell obtained such bad infor
mation, " he continued. "The Villistas
carried absolutely nothing away with
them excopt somo of the prisoners
from tho penitentiary, many of whom
have since retuurncd here. They cap-
f
i
tured neither ammunition, cannon, nor
anything else.
"Our artillery drove the Villistas
out of the places wh'lch they had
taken, and pursued them In their
hasty retreat with shell, leaving them
no time to carry anything away as
tfby left, galloping in small groups
through the narrow streets ot the
town."
General Trcvlno asserted that every
unit of his force was co-ordinated, that
all prisoners examined by him agreed
that Villa's band did not number more
than 600; that there were no defec
tions from the garrison, and that all
oil of the automobiles in the city are
accounted for, none being arrled away
by the raiders. Government fire only
ceased, he said, when the bandits had
bene repulsed and there seemed dan
ger of hitting the pursuing forces
under Generals Romos and Marrlorl.
Bell Declares News Authentic
El Paso, Texas, Sept. 22. Brigadier
General George Bell, Jr., commanding
the El Paso military district, said to
day that his information concerning
Villa's Hidalgo Day attack upon Chi
huahua City was obtained from "sev
eral most reliable sources." While
ho did not divulge his sources of in
telligence, he said that he had every
reason to believe that his report to
the war department was founded on
fact and not based on border rumors.
General Bell refused to comment on
General Trevlno's statement.

VILLISTA BAND
Bandit Chief Loses Prestige
Because of Failure to Ob
tain Promised Loot.
Chihuahua City, Mexico, Sept. 21,
via El Paso Junction, Sept 22. Car
ranza troops are pursuing the band
of Villistas, which attacked Chihua
hua City last Saturday, southward,
according to official announcement
here today. The Villistas are report
ed passing along the road to JIminez,
southwest of Chihuahua City. Ranch
ers arriving report Villa's forces were
discouraged . at failure to obtan loot
promised by Villa when he captured
the city.
Reports from the district through
which the band is passing, it was giv
en out, say Villa has lost considerable
prestige because of failure of the at
tack. Prisoners taken by Villa who have
returned, say Villa's plan was to sur
round the palace during the Independ
ence day celebration, kill General Ja
cinto Trevino, commandant at Chl
huahna City, and his staff and to dis
organize the garrison.
Villa last was reported in the Si
erra do la Silla district near Santa
