H Mention has been made in the col-
B umns of The Record n number of
H times of the building activity of the
H present season, which is attracting
H wide spread attention and has brought
H together here prominent building Arms
H from various parts of this state, us
H well as one or more from California,
H and has also supplied work for all
H the local mechanics who cared to par-
H ticipate. Besides the erection of four
H substantial and creditable business
H blocks on Main street, the building
jH program of thiB season includes not
H less than six or eight substantial and
H modem homes, und as a little side
H issue, so to speak, the County Fair
H buildings that uttructed favorable at-
H tention at the time the fair was being
H held here.
H In ail, a total of considerably more
B than $100,000 will be expended in the
H city this year on new buildings.
H A few days since the editor of The
H Record made a tour of inspection of
H tho buildings under course of erection
H atid had the plans explained to him
H by one of the architects who drew up
H the specifications for the greater num-
H ber of them. It is certainly gratifying
H to note the substantial improvements
H that are being made, which speak vol-
H umea for the permanency and bright
H future of Cedar City.
H Pretentious Business Blocks.
H The most expensive and preten-
H tious of these new improvements is
H the new business block that is being
H erected for the Cedar Sheep Associti-
H tion, at a cost of approximately $25,-
H 000.00. This will be one of the most
H commodious and convenient store
H buildings in the soutKern part of the
H state, when completed, and will pre-
H sent a most attractive appearance,
H with its front of beautiful imported
H pressed brick and pleasing nrchitcc-
H ture. The plans, which were drawn
H by Cannon & Fetzer of Salt Lake City
H with whom our local architect, R. L.
H Jones, is associated, contemplate, also,
H the refacing of the present building
Hj to give it a uniform appearance with
H the new structure, and the interior
H arrangement and furnishings will be
H most convenient and compact. Mr. E.
H T. Ashton and Sons of Salt Lake City
H have charge of the work. The base-
H ment is now all completed, and the
H walls are being rapidly reared.
H A ten or twelvo thousand dollar ad-
H dition is being erected to the Cedurs
H Hotel, which will add some eighteen or
H twenty rooms to its capacity, and will
H greatly improve the appearance of
H the structure. Mr. Bert Wood, a lo-
M cal contractor, has charge of the work
H and is pushing it along at a lively
H clip. The roof is now on and the plus-
H tering and finishing is under way.
H Ashton Sons have just completed
H a large garage for Mr. U. T. Jones
H on the east side of Main street, which
H is strictly modern in every respect,
H and conveniently arranged for taking
H care of this line of business. The
H front portion of the upper floor, which
H is being completed in a modern and
H convenient manner, with full plumb-
H ing, etc., has been rented for office
H and living purposes, and the remain-
H der of the building has been rented to
H John H. Fife, the local distributor for
H Ford cars.
H Almost directly across tho street u
H large and substantial brick garage is
H also well under way, a portion of
H which will be occupied by tho project-
H od steam laundry as soon as the build-
H ing is completed and ready for occu
H v pancy. ThiB building is being erected
H Mtf &t tno expense of the management of
H the Palace Drug Store, and Mr. Thom-
H as Perry has charge of the work. The
H cost is estimuted at about ten thou-
H flund dollars. The walls of this block
H are now up and work has commenced
H on the roof.
H Some Splendid Homes.
H Among the new and costly homes
H that an being erected, tho rosldonco
l
B''
HL "
I
, of James Smith, a new comer here
from Kane county, is perhaps the most
pretentious. The plans and specifica
tions were drawn by Architect Jones,
and the work is in charge of Mr. Ash-,
jton. The estimated cost is $9,000.
Imported pressed brick arc being used
for surfacing all the walls, and the in
terior arrangement represents the
last word on home construction, with
built-in closets, cabinets, flower re
ccpticlcs, etc. There will be a billard
room in the basement, and the houso
will comprise ten or a dozen rooms in
all. The finishing work in this build
ing is now under way and it will be
ready for occupancy by the time cold
weather sets in.
A brief doscription of T. A. Thor
ley's new residence on Main street has
already been published in these col
umns. This is a very beautiful mod
ern brick bungalow, and will cost ap
proximately $8,000.00. Mr. E. Burton
of Nephi, the well known contractor,
supplied the plans and has charge of
the construction work. Another few
weeks will see this home ready for
occupancy.
Mr. Arch Swapp's now home will be
another of Cedar City's finest resi
dences. Jones is again the architect
and Ashton the superintendent of tho
work. The cost will be approximately
$7,000, and the arrangement is very
modern and convenient, with full
plumbing and heating, billiard room
on the second floor, and ull conven
iences built in. Mr. Swnpp is also
having n neat and substantial enough
brick gurage built to answer for a
home for the ordinnry family of mod
crate means. He, also, is a new coiner
here from Kane county.
Over in tho east part, of town, im
mediately south of tho J. J. G. Web
ster residence, Messrs. Jones and Ash
ton have a new $5,000 home under way
for Thomas Bulloch. While not very
large, this will be a strictly modern
and convenient residence, with full
plumbing and heating. It will contain
six rooms, and will consist of two
floors and basement.
A neat 5 room bungalow is also be
ing erected by the same parties for
Mr. William Ford immediately south
of his old home on First East street.
It will be very attractive and conven
ient, and will cost approximately $2,
500. Another home in course of erection
is being built by Mr. J. II. Patten, a
California contractor, for Mr. Byron
Ahlstrom.
Add to this the $7,000 swimming
pool constructed to the Ward Hall, and
a number of minor improvements to
residences, etc., besides the County
Fair buildings and we have n building
program that Cedar City can well be
proud of.
Mr. Ashton informs us that the
buildings being erected under his di
rection alone aggregate more than
$60,000.00, so that the entire expend
iture would considerably exceed $100,
000.00, as before mentioned.
RISKS LIFE FOR REALISM
Film Star Refuses to Have "Double"
Do Auto Leap.
Driving an automobile across a 35
foot chasm ut a 60-mile-an-hour clip is
a feat performed by Thomas Chatter
ton in "The Secret of the Submarine,"
the big film novel now being shown in
weekly chapters at the Thorley the
atre. To do the stunt Mr. Chatterton, who
essays the role of Lieutenant Hope, U.
S. -N., in the big picture, overcame ob
jections of directors and managers
who had employed Al. Thompson, a
professional darcdovil, to make the
mad ride, and mad ride it was.
The scene was taken on tho road
between Los Angeles and Santa Bar
bara, at a spot where a bridge had
actually been washed out by the spring
rains. Three cameras were trained on
the flying carfentching it as it left the
broken side of the bridge, as it went
through the air and landing safely on
the far side. There was no announce
ment made of their plans by the pro
ducing company, but tho authorities
of Camerillo, a small village nearest
the scene, scenting the excitement,
dismissed school so that tho pupils
could, witness the thrill-making.
"Aeroplanes are tame to this," Mr.
Chatterton commented as he received
the congratulations of Director Sar
gent. "I was never sure that the ma
chine would stay right side up and
when we landed on the far side I
thought my teeth were all jarred loose
But it will give a thrill to tho story
and that is what we are after realism
with a big 'R'-and we will get it in
overy chapter."
And the remainder of the company
nodded approval.

BEAUTIFUL SERVICES
AT THE TABERNACLE
Was a Man Universally Respected and
Will be Greatly Missed From

City tabernacle, commencing at 3 p.
in., funeral services were held over tho

Tho casket was heavily laden with
beautiful flowers, and the services
partook more of the nature of n fare
well love feast than of a funeral.
All members of the Stake Presiden
cy were present upon the stand.
The speakers recited many of the
incidents of the life of the departed,
and all bore sincere testimony to the
worthy and cxamplary life which ho
led. Those heard from on the occa
sion were, Elders David Bulloch, John
V. Adams, Morgan Richards of Paro
wan, Dr. G. W. Middleton of Salt Lake
City, Henry Leigh and Bishop A. G.
Matheson.
By special request the song, "This
World is Full of Beauty," was rend
ered by Gomer Cosslett.
The choir was present and rendered
appropriate hymns.
A long line of automobiles and oth
er vehicles followed the hearse to the
cemetery, where interment was mude.
Tho grave was dedicated by President
Wm. II. Lyman of Parowan.
BIOGRAPHICAL.
Richard Palmer was born in Aber
dare, ' Wales, March 20, 1828. At the
age of ten he began working in a ma
chine shop, and from then until his
young manhood was engaged in black
smithing, engineering and working
among metals.
Ho first heard of Mormonism at the
age of fifteen, and five years later cm
braced tho faith, becoming an activo
officer and member in the Welsh mis
sion. In 1851 he came to America,
and after working in St. Louis and
vicinity for about a year, joined tho
A. O. Smoot company of Latter-day
Saint emigrants and started across
the plains in May, 1852. The trip
proved to bo a very hard one, as Salt
Lake Valley was not reached until
September nnd tho subject of our
sketch, though ill with chills and fe
ver, had to walk nearly all tho way.
After arriving at Salt Lake, ho took
up his trade of blacksmlthing and
worked at it until tho "grasshopper
year" of 1855, when the promise of n
more plentiful supply of food stuff
lured him to journey southward to the
new settlement of Cedar City, or what
is now known as the Old Fort. Hero
ho again took up his trado among the
early, struggling pioneers, nnd en
dured all the hardships of tho ardu
ous pioneering days of the section in
which he has since lived.
, In 18G0 he went on a mission to
I Great Britain, where ho held the po
i s'ition of president of the Monmouth
shire conference, and where ho met
his wife, Johanna Roes Palmer.
Survived by six children, four sons
and two daughters, nnd by his wife,
whoso untiring devotion nnd tendor
' cure of her oged husband was instru
mental in prolonging his lifo to tho
ripe ago ho attained.
Richard was the only member of
tho Palmer family to join tho Mormon
Church and migrato to Amorlea. Ho
- , ..- ... ,. .
was tho eldest of a family of six, all of
whom he survived by many years.
Ho died of old age and general de-
I bilitv. Ills last sickness was marked
I by the exceptional patience nnd cheer-
i fulness that characterized his wholo
life, nnd particularly his recent years,
during which timo he was deprived of
his eyesight.
Ho was possessed of a most remnrk
nble memory, nnd up to tho Inst hours
of his illness, his intellect was ns clear
and nctivo as that of a young man in
health. Confronted by tho Inst groat
change, ready for, tho final step from
this stage of action, nnd fully cogniz
nnt of tho fact that ho had only n few
days more to live, ho was just as keen
for the important news of the world
nnd the locnl hnppenings as at any
period of his life. Nor was ho obliv
ious or unmindful of his most trivinl
obligations, nnd insisted upon his af
fairs being kept right up to tho min
ute. Like n leaf which had grown, not
sear and yellow, on the stem, but ns
white ns the driven Bnow, ho finally
let go his earthly support and dropped
into the waiting lap of Mother earth,
surrounded by relatives and friends
who had gone before, and whom he
felt tho positive assurance of meeting
and greeting once more.
Brother Palmer was a familiar fig
ure in Cedar City. He was one of tho
lnndmarks, nnd ho will be greatly
missed and often thought of by those
who nrc left behind.
