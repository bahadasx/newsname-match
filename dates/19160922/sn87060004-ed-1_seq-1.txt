A Distinctive Reason
What is tho chief reason for the superi
ority of Royal Baking Powder?
There are several good reasons, but there
is one which distinguishes Royal from other
baking powders.
This reason, which every woman should
know, is that Royal BakingPowder is made
from cream of tartar, which comes from
grapes. This means u healthful fruit origin.
It means natural food as distinguished from
mineral substitutes used in other baking
powders.
There is no alum nor phosphate in Royal
Baking Powder.

Greatly Missed by Citi

It is with' much regret that
Tho Be publishes tho going
awajr of Mr. and Mm. II. D.
Oowand for wo loso two of the
best citizens we hive, and their
futuro homo will certaiuly. gain
thoso that any comtnuuity will
certniulv be proud of.
Mr, Howand camo to Earlinc-
ton 10 years ago last"juno and
has at alt times bben a livo wire,
a good citfz in and a loyal man
to tho church and all things per
taining to tho uplifting of every
thing thats good.
Mr. Uowand's past record has
bcon ono of higher aims and has
been a record thatdeservos much
credit.
Mr. Oowaud came to Earling
ton in January sixteen years ago
and was a faithful employe of
tho St. Barnard Mining Com
pany's storo under tho manage
mont of J as. R. Rash for several
vears. In the spring of 1008 Mr.
Oowand organized tho firm of
Cirnes, Cowand & Co., giving
Eirlington IU first up to dito re
tail mercantile store. lie was man
a tor, secretary and treasurer of
tho firm for seven years. Id the
spring ofdOll Mr. Oowand open
4d a storo for himself in the He
Lcod stand and has enjoyed a
eood business since.
Mr? Cowand is an enterprising
citizen, a progressive metchant
and a booster for the town in
which ho live. The Bee and
other enterprises, especially the
churches and benevolent societies
will certainly miss Mr. aud Mrs.'
Oowand and bis storo for he is a
man that never failed to respond
both cheerfully and libera ly
when called upon regardless of
faith or creed.
His life here has been ono that
would uot bo bad for others to
follow, both aa a nusiuess man,
as a citiz n nn 1 as a booster.
It is with much regret that we
(oso such pqoplo as Mr. and Mrs.
Cowand. Still it is our loss and
the others gaiu.
Wo sincerely trust their futuro
will be both happy and prosper
ous. Our gatoj stand unlocked
for their return any time should
they so desire.
'Ilard buyers," men and
women who buy with their heads
as well as their -pocketbooks,
will be quick to tako advantage
of our ,our magazine bargain offer.
