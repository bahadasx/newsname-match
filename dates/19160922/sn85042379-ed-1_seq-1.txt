Well Known Homesteader
Takes Own Life With Gun
George Monk, a well known home
steader, residing on a claim about 12
miles south of Oswego, took his own
life last Saturday evening by firing
a bullet from a heavy calibre revolv
er through his heart. Reports from
Oswego are to the effect that Monk
had had some trivial quarrel with his
wife during the day and she had
threatened to leave him. He stated
at the time that if she left him he
would kill himself, but not taking his
threat seriously, Mrs. Monk left the
house for one of the neighbors close
by. Shortly after leaving she heard
a shot fired and hurrying back to the
home found her husband breathing his
last and the revolver with which he
had killed himself lying close by. Mrs.
Monk immediately notified the neigh
bors and word was sent to the mother
of the deceased who arrived at Os
wego last Monday and took charge of
the remains which were shipped to St.
Paul for burial.
George Monk was a man about 34
years of age and was quite well
known over the section of the state
having worked as a dining car con*!
ductor out of St. Paul for several
years. He is survived by a wife and

NEW PAPER FOR OPHEIM
A new paper, to be known as the
Observer, is slated to make its first
appearance at Opheim next week, the
editor and publisher being R. E. Tait,
who has been for some time connected
with the News in this city. A com
plété equipment, including a cylinder
press and entire outfit of material for
newspaper and commercial job print
ing, has arrived here, and will be in
stalled at Opheim as rapidly as pos
sible.
Mr. Tait has had considerable ex
perience as a newspaper man in the
east, and no doubt will be successful
in this new venture. We understand
that the editorial policy of the paper
will be Democratic.

friends in Malta they received the sad
news of the death of Mr. Rathbone ;
who was found dead with a ghastly j

ORGANIZING IN
VALLEY COUNTY!
— I
Non-Partisan League Now Has.
Headquarters at Glasgow.
REPRESENTATIVES AT WORK j
League i.s Non-Political and Aim is to
Promote Legislation Beneficial J
to Farmers.
Organization work of the Montana |
Farmers Non-Partisan League has;
been inaugurated in Valley County,
this week by R. D. and A. E. Bowen
who are the principle representatives
in this state for the work. The or
ganization will conduct its affairs
along the same lines as are used in
the Dakotas where so great a sue-!
ces> has been obtained during the;
pa; t two years. As th" Courier un
derstands it the organization is pure
ly ron-partisan and it does not ma ko
any pretense of boosting any particu
lar party. Its purpose is to select
men for candidates for state legislat
ive of!ice who have shown they ar? in
teivsku in the I • ttermenc of the wel
fare oi the fa'Wijr and who have dem
onstrated to the farmer that they are
willing to go into the legislature and
work for the enactment of such laws
as will bring about the desired re
sults to them. Men who will stick
to the work in hand until it is finish
ed and will do all possible to the end
that the farmer is treated with equal
fairness in legislation as any other
business interests.
The program of the Non-Partisan
League comprises legislation for t/e
exemption of farm improvements from 1
taxation, state hail insurance, term
inal elevators and (lour mills, non
partisan election laws, equal taxation
of corporations, agricultural lands,
state inspection and dockage, rural
credit banks, operated at cost, and
other beneficial enactments. Organ
ization work is going forward in Mon- ■
THE CAMPAIGN
Bp John A. Goodrich

f
-I
Probably in this 191(5 campaign the I
electors will give a more rational con
sideration to subjects under discussion
than they have given in any former 1
campaign; not only has the crisis of
the world conflict caused people to
think more seriously 011 all human 1
problems but public education in the s
United States has been advancing in j
recent years at a pace never attained ]
in previous history. The campaign,
of "headlines" and "catchwords" will
be less potent in this year of Grace
than ever before.
Those campaign committees who
think to win the masses by reference
to "Charlie" Hughes and his whiskers;
by attempts to answer most vital and
relevant charges based 011 the written
record of acts and events by asking
"what would you have done?" are,
we think, woefully misjudging the j
breadth of intelligence and informa- !
tion of the American electorate.
The record and merits of the Wilson
administration of the presidential of
fice are on trial; where the record is!
good the president and his managers,
will stand on the record; where it is
vulnerable they will use all sorts of j
expedients to divert attention there- j
1
!
!
;
j
j
from to side issues. Of course by
virtue of his candidacy Mr. Hughes
brings his record and achievements
also to trial.
Mr. Wilson and his managers, very
compatibly with true Democratic in
terest, are assuming that the pre-,
sidency is the only office in which a.
record befitting a presidential candi
date can be made. This assumption
is made for the most excellent reason
that the record of Mr. Hughes as gov
ernor and Judge, approaches about
as nearly to invulnerability as does
any record yet disclosed in the history
of American politics.
With seven years of experience as
a Judge of the Supreme Court of the
United States, alone, Mr. Hughes must
have gotten closely and deeply ac
quainted with a multitude of prob
lems of national import; and if it be
said that judicial experience is not a
safe guarantee of executive proficien
cy it may also be said in the instance
of Mr. Hughes, that while he ranked
high in the science of jurisprudence,
as an able and enlightened Judge, he
was yet not chosen on account of his
Una very rapidly, no less than 32
rien in automobiles working here at,
the present time. The organization
will be independent of the other farm
er organizations of the state but will
en-operate with them in its work.
The Farmers Non-Partisan League
does not put a political ticket in the
field at elections but selects men from
the various tickets considered quali-j
fied to represent them and then vote
solid. In the Dakotas they have met
vit' much success along this line. At'
the last nominating election in North
Dakota, out of 111 candidates the
League nomintaed 87 candidates and
at the election the Secretary of State,
mdorsed by the League won by a ma
jority of 40,000, and the Governor
was returned by a majority of 4,000
vot> s over the combined vote given t.i
the other six candidates.
A means of promoting the relations
of ills League is that of farmeis pic

MARRIAGE LICENSES

judicial record but for the reason the 1
American people came, to repose su
preme confidence in him as a fearless!
advocate and a great governor previ
ous to his service as a member of the;
Supreme Court.
The national government touching'
the people of all the states and deal-.
ing with foreign powers affords the
presidency an exaltation above that
of the governorship of a state; but :
the government of a state touches the j
(people many times where the federal
government touches them once, and
its functions and powers are in many
respects more far reaching and com- ;
plex than that of the national govern-!
ment. j
The state government has jurisdic-'
itio n over a vast domain, over the citi-l
zen's life, property and welfare; it
provides laws for the government of
great cities; of contract and police^
of corporate and business regulation,;
governing the conditions of women,
children and of labor; of the relations
of husband and wife, of parer. mut!
child. .
The governor of a great state in>
these days cy tremendous develop-!
ment and change requires no less of
the statesman's comprehension, cour -j
age and executive power than does'
the president. Mr. Hughes was gov
ernor of a great state in a time of
unrest and of insistent demands for
great constructive changes, of great
readjustment of mighty clashing in
tercsts.
He met the demands of the great 1
office to the fullest measure of an en-j
lightened statesman of a great age;|
he showed powers of comprehensing
intricate and complex situations and,
problems; of constructive leadership;!
of decision, of courage and of strength j
that have raerly, if ever, been sur- ,
passed in the history of this country. J
The indubitable answer to the ques
tion: "What would you have done?",
is the Hughes record as governor of j
New York which the Democrats do
not attack and have no stomach for!
sittacking. This questfan, "What
would you have done?" is asked not
; seriously but to divert attention from
; the grave short comings of the Demo
!*cratic president, which if fairly con
j templated disqualify him for further
; service as chief executive.

GARDEN EXHIBITS SMALL
Early Frost Makes Usual Showing of
Vegetable Crop Impossible. Grain
and Root Crops First Class.
Thursday evening tho Valley coun
ty agricultural exhibit left for the
State Fair at Helena. It will include
all the best threshed grains shqwn at
the county fair as well as the best
sheafs of grain and a large variety
of green vegetables and root crops
wli'ch have been gathered during the
past week by S. C. Moore, who was
designated by the county commission
ers ;r make the exhibit.
The exhibit will not be as large as
it was last year owing to the difficulty
experienced in collecting it, many of
the grain fields visited being either
damaged by the rust sufficient to make
it impractical to shaw the grain in
the straw or else there was not the
quality found in the grain. Even with
a smaller amount of grain there is
every possibility of the Valley coun
ty exhibit winning a good many priz
es, as it has done before, for the grain
selected shows to be of a very excel
ient quality and has been put through
the fanning mill many times to get
it as clean as possible.
In the vegetable and root crop de
partment the exhibit will give keen
competition to the coulity that beats
them as all these have been personally
selected by Mr. Moore who lias gone
into the fields throughout the county
and dug the potatoes, beets, parsnips,
carrots, sugar beets, and in fa< t prac
tically the entire collection. Owing
to the early frost a considerable am
ount of garden truck could nol be
gathered. Melons which have always
won for Valley county are this year
prr.ctically out of the running as is
the case with a great many other
things.
Among the farmers who will have
their products exhibited at Helena,
this year are John Domka, C. M. Pet
erson, Z. J. Foust, Ole Stensland, M.
Kelly, F. L. Beizer, J. Maalerud, Her
man Sieving, C. A. Collins, C. H. Rich
ardson and many others. Mr. Col
lins will accompany the exhibit this
year and will assist Mr Moore in ar
ranging it and placing it before the
judges. Mr. Collins has been one of
the hard workers for the success of
the county fair and has helped very
materially in making the state exhi
bit« as good as they have been for
the past two years.
WATKINS HERE SUNDAY
F. L. Watkins, one of the foremost
Prohibition workers of North Dakota
will deliver an address at the Gib
son Opera House, Sunday evening,
September 24th.
There has been much controversy
over the results of prohibition in
North Dakota—some claiming that
more liquor is consumed there than
Ruffcorn Wants To Know
Who the Falsifiers Are
j
,
J
j
In the Valley County News under
date of September Hth, the readers of
that paper were regaled with articles
by Lieut. T. F. King, late of Saco
and now of Co. G., 2nd Mont. Inf., and
Col. Dan I. Donohue, the colonel of
the Montana Regiment, relating to
the discharge of former Private
George W. Ruffcorn, lately discharged
from service.
In these articles by the distinguish
ed military men the writer is referred
to in terms quite uncomplimentary
and in language perfervid. My dis
charge—coming directly from the War
Department to my company command
er, Capt. Reynolds of L company, to
which company I had gotten a trans
fer from G company, commanded by
Doc. Layton—seems indeed to have
been a "particularly sore spot" not
alone with Col. Dan but also with
the said King, not to mention Doc.
Layton whose paramount share in the
series of underhanded double-crosses
I shall presently show.
In the first place I was told by Doc.
Layton when we first arrived at Hel
ena that there would be no trouble in
securing my discharge forthwith. Doc.
said he and Colonel Dan were bosom
in Montana and that the open saloon
is preferable to blind pigs.
After years of residence in North
Dakota, Mr. Watkins will give the
absolute facts about North Dakota
and prove his statements by official
reports.
He will then make a plea for a
"Dry" Montana and the enforcement
of the proposed prohibition law.
In the afternoon Mr. Watkins will
speak at the Union church in Galpin,
and then return to Glasgow in the
afternoon in time to attend a con
ference of the prohibition forces at
3:00 o'clock. Mr. Watkins and some
of the local speakers and singers will
conduct a street meeting Sunday eve
ning at 7 o'clock, at the corner of
Fifth St., and First Ave. So., opposite
the depot.
COUNTRY WATCHES
JEANETTE RANKIN
Nation-wide interest has been arous
ed by the candidacy of Miss Jean
nette Rankin, who is the first woman
in the United States to run for con
gress, judging by press notices ap
pearing in almost every newspaper
in the country.
In speaking of her candidacy the
Seattle Times says: "Miss Rankin
is an excellent speaker, attractive in
appearance, and skilled politician, and
stands an excellent chance of being
the lirst woman member of congress."
The Spokesman-Review says: "Miss
Jeannette Rankin, leader of the con
gressional ticket in Montana seems
to be popular with the G. O. P."
The New York Sun: "Miss Rankin
has a rare personality, a fine intellect
and an unusual perspective; and her
candidacy has aroused national in
terest."
The Salt Lake Herald-Republican:
"Another thing that Montana will do
this year will he to elect a woman
as a congressman, and she will be
a republican. Her name is Miss Jean
nette Rankin."
The Colorado Spokesman: "Miss
Jeannette Rankin of Montana, who led
the republican ticket in the primaries
is the only congressional candidate
who ran on a "dry" platform, land the
tremendous vote given her, may fore
shadow the result of the liquor refer
endum next November."
Oregon Register: "Miss Jeannette
Rankin, the republican candidate for
congress from Montana, is a good
speaker and is making an active cam
paign. She led the congressional
ticket in the primaries by more than
(J,000 votes."
Talahassee (Florida) Times: "Miss
Jeannette Rankin, republican candi
date for congress, is receiving the
support of both democratic and re
publican women, and in the event of
her election will be the first congress
woman in the United States."
SHORT TIME TO REGISTER
Only fourteen more days left in
which to register for the general elec
tion which will be held on November
7th. You must register before Sat
urday, October 7th if you wish to vote
at the general election.
friends. He said that I m : ght go
ahead with perfect assurance, sign
the muster roll and take the federal
oath. He repeated upon this occa
sion that he could get me discharged
and reiterated his closeness to the
Colonel. I therefore made out and
signed a statement which Layton was
to lay before the colonel. After sign
ing the muster roll I inquired of Lay
ton and was told that the adjutant
had carried my statement around in
his pocket and that it had not been
acted upon, nor even transmitted to
headquarters. I then asked permis
sion of Layton to go up town—to Hel
ena. I told him I wished to see the
Governor. The permission was re
fused but that afternoon Governor
Stewart came out to the camp. I
took the matter up with him and after
inquiring into my case he dictated the
form of my application for discharge.
We finally went to the border. There
I learned that my application had been
disapproved. At that time I asked
Donohue if layton had not taken the
matter up with him at Helena. Dono
hue said "that Layton had not". Who's
a liar?
