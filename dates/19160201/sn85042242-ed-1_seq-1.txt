Willing to Help.
"We alfeo know that the city of
Fargo "dug" up $2,000 for the Medora
bridge and we personally 'dug* up
ourselves and will say if the question
of moving the capital from Bismarck
to New Rockford came up we would
dig up as much money as we did for
this Medora bridge.
"We were always of the opinion
that there was not a possible chance
to get the capital moved from Bis­
marck, as any fair-minded citizen
would not Vote for a removal.
"Bismarck has the capital and
there is no reason why we should
change it and it Is as central as any
part of the state.
Agricultural College.
"According to principles, we do not
think it would be any more fair to
move the capital from Bismarck than
it would be to move the Agricultural
college from Fargo, and we .honestly
believe that the people of Bismarcta
have nothing to fear but that Fargojxl
will stand loyally behind them."
Other assurances have .been receiv­
ed at Bismarck that the opinion? set
forth by Rev. L. T. Guild, editor Of
the Courier-News, is in no way repre­
sentative of the attitude of the Fargo
business-interests to Bismarck and
the Slope country. This city has
'been urged to force Rev. Guild to lay
before States Attorney Berndt evi­
dence of the alleged lawlessness of
Bismarck so that the guilty ones can
toe punished. Those acquainted with
local conditions, however, declare
that Bismarck was never cleaner- and
that the illegal sale of liquor has
been reduced to practically nothing.
The publisher of the Fargo Forum
communicated with the editor of the
'Bismarck Tribune yesterday and as
sured him that his publication would
be neutral and print the arguments
of both sides without favor. He also
stated that Fargo did not want to
treat Bismarck unfairly and that or
ders have been given to investigate
the truth of any matter submitted for
publication involving Bismarck.
An organization representing the
Bismarck business interests, acting in
perfect harmony and co-operation
with the Commerqial club, has been
formed to set forth the merits of Bis­
marck and defend her clear title to
the capital and advance arguments
in support of its retention as the
seat of stilted government.
Members of that organization stat
ed yesteMa^ that all they asked from
the press* of North Dakota was a
square deal. It is the Arm conviction
of Bismarck that the capital removal
movement is backed by land specu­
lators who are using the initiative to
exploit their own selfish interests.
Through the Tribune, Eismarck
seeks to warn voters against sign
ing any of the petitions that are
being circulated in favor of iNew
Rockford.

Washington, .lan. 31.—A further
communication from Germany in the

late hour it had not been received.
It was understood that new repre­
sentations would follow the informal
character of recent stages of the ne­
gotiations and might contain a new
set of proposals in lieu of those re­
jected a few days ago by the United
States.
Secretary Lansing said today he
had no confirmation of the news dis­

answer was on its way to the United
States and "that the action of the
submarine commander is not disap­
proved and that Germany will make
no further concessions."

President Declares, God Helping Him, He Will Keep Nation Out
of War. Urges Those of Foreign Birth to Support
Preparedness Program.
Milwaukee, Jan. 31.—President Wil­
son, speaking before the largest audi­
ence of his present trip, declared the
men who say the Americans will
not stand together in time of trouble
have shot their bolt.
"1 have not supposed that the men
whose voices seemed to show a
threat against us represented even
the people they claimed to represent,"
he said.
The president spoke to an audience
many of whom were of foreign birth.
He declared he knew the men who
came from foreign lands to America
loved liberty and would stand by the
ideals of America.
Appeals for Support.
He appealed to all Americans to
support the government in its nation­
al defense plan.
"I want at the outset to remove any
misapprehension in your minds," said
the president. "There is no crisis
nothing new has happened. I came
to confer with you on a matter which
we should confer on in any event.
"We should see that our house is
set in order. When all the world is
afire, the sparks fly everywhere.
America has drawn her blood and her
energy out. of all the nations of the
world," he said. "We know that our
roots and our traditions run best' into
other soil. We cannot forget our for­
bears.
"At the outset of the war, it did
look as if there was a division of do­
mestic sentiment which might lead us
into some errors of judgment. I for
one believe that danger is past."
The crowd applauded. "I never
doubted that the danger was exagger­
ated.
"I know the magic of America. I
Know the impulses which draw moh
to our shores. 1 know that they came
to be free.
"1 know that when the test conies,
every man's heart will lx first for
America," he declared amid applause.
Shot Their Bolts.
"The troublemakers have shot their
bolts. They have been loud but in­
effectual. Their talk costs nothing.
"I pledge you," he continued sol­
emnly, "that God helping, I will keep
you out of war."
He v/ent on to say the nation want­
ed him to preserve the honor of the
United States. The applause con­
tinued. He told how difficult it was
to do both.
"This people is not going to choose
war," he went on. "But we are deal­
ing with government rather than
people, and we do not know what an
nour or day will bring forth.

thing of military life if the call should
come. That is the reason I am urg­

States that at least a part of the peo­
ple be trained.
Lines of Blood.
"As I came along the line of (he
railway today, I was touched to ob­
serve that on every staff where a flag
could be raised, there floated the
stars and stripes.
"Those lines of red are lines of
blood, r.obly and unselfishly shed by
men who lowd the liberty of their
fellowmen more than they Joved their
own lives and fortunes.
"God forbid that we should have to
use the blood of America to freshen
the color of that flag, but if it should
again be necessary to assert the ma­
jesty and integrity of those ancient
and honorable principles, that flag
will be glorified and purified again."
"The United States has made pre­
parations for immediate war so far as
the navy is concerned, although the
present naval forces is inadequate, in
size, President Wilson declared to­
night in an address before several
thousand persons in the Auditorium
here.
"We mean business," he said, in
speaking of the preparedness plans
of the United States.
"We have given to the present fleet
of the United States an organization
such as it has never had before, I
am told by Admiral Fletcher," the
president said.
Navy Is Prepared.
"And we have made preparations
for immediate war so far as the navy
is concerned."
The army, the president said, as at
present constituted, "is not large
enough for the ordinary duties of
peace."
The president repeated his warning
that no time must be lost' in strength­
ening the defenses of the nations. He
declared the government was doing
everything it could for preparedness.
"When I see some of my fellow
citizens spread tinder where the
sparks are falling, I wonder what
their idea of Americanism it," he
said. "America," the president said,
"has been cruelly misjudged by the
nations now at war. I know that on
the other side of the water there has
been a great deal of cruel misjudg
ment for the reasons why America
has remained neutral. Those look­
ing at us from a distance do not feel
the strong pulses of ideals and prin­
ciples that* are in us.
Mission of Peace.
"They do not feel the conviction
of America that our mission is a mis­
sion of peace and that righteousness
cannot be maintained as a standard
in the midst of arms. They do not
realize that with *11 our enerey we
are a body of idealists, much more
