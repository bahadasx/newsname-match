from her stern and In charge of a j
German prize crew, the British South J
African liner Appam. given up for,
lost, took refuge in Hampton Roads j
this morning: with the story of seven
vessels destroyed by German sea raid- ,
eis off the African coast.
The Appam was i-aptured off the j
Canary Islands on January 13 by a
German raider four days after she I

Africa, for Plymouth, Eng.
Whether the captor was a German
U-boat or a hitherto unreported Ger
man auxiliary cruiser is undeter- j
mined. From what was learned by j
some of the officials who boarded the i
Appam it is believed that some steam- '
er. armed as a German auxiliar raid-;
ins shipping off the African coast took
the British liner and put the prize
crew aboard. This view is supported
by the fact that a raider could
hardly have spared a lieutenant and
such a large crew to a prize.

151 Persons on Board
There are 451 persons aboard tliei

Many of the passengers on the Ap
pam are women and children. There 1

wounded sailors, taken from one of the
sunken ships, which resisted capture
and was shelled.

Austrian Submarines
Deny Sinking of Persia;

fly Associated Press
Washington. D. Feb. I.—Secre
tary Lansing to-day announced the re
ceipt of a dispatch from Ambassador
Pentield. at Vienna, saying tkat he had
been informed by the foreign office
that all Austrian submarines operating
in the Mediterranean had reported that
none of them was concerned in the
sinking of the Peninsular and Oriental
liner Persia.
The secretary also announced that
he was addressing to Ambassador Mor- >
genthau for presentation to the Turk
ish government an inquiry as to I
whether a Turkish submarine was re
sponsible. The State Department con- ,
siders that the statement from Austria-
Hungary closes the question of
whether a submarine of that nation

APPAM RAISES
NEW PERPLEXING
LAW QUESTIONS
Arrival of Vessel Puts United
States in Delicate Posi
tion
CASK IS ENTIRELY NEW
If Ship Is Considered as Auxi
liary Cruiser It May Stay
Awhile
By Associated Press
Washington. D. C.. Feb. I.—Perplex
j lug questions of international law may
arise from the arrival of the Appam
in Hampton Koads. First, the United I
States must determine whether the j
ship simply is a prize of war or i
whether she tias been supplied with )
any armament which would give her.
the character of an auxiliary cruiser, i
So far as naval authorities here know. |
no case exactly like it has arisen to |
concern the limited States since the'
! beginning of the war. The German i
ships Kronprinz Wilhelm and Prinz
Eitel Friedrich. which took refuge in
Hampton Koads early in the war. were
i auxiliary cruisers, and now are in-!
1 terned as such.
The Hague convention provides:
"A prize may only be brought into a j
neutral port on account of unsea-1
worthiness, stress of weather or want I
of fuel or provisions.
"It must leave as soon as the cir- i
ctimstances which justify the entry are;
at an end. If it does not, the neutral j
I powers must order it to leave at once: !
I should it fail lo obey, the neutral!
power must employ the means at its 1
disposal to release it. with its officers;
i and < row. and to intern the prize 1
I crew."
Will Hold Vessel
In case the Appam can ba conskfl
ered as an auxiliary cruiser, she is l
entitled under international law to a j
1 certain length of time to make any.
necessary repairs and loan enough coal I
and provisions to carry her to the'
nearest home port.
In any event officials here regard it l
as a forecone conclusion that the Ap- I
pamSwill remain in Hampton Roads!
1 until the end of the war.
Secretary I>arfsing said the Appam ]
rase would involve considerable in
! vestigation before any action by this
| government was taken. There was
nothing to do. he said, until the va
lidity of the capture was determined.
Inasmuch as the Appam is the first
rase since the beginning of the present
war where a prize had been brought
into an American port, officials said
; there would be a careful study of the
subject in all phases so that when a
I decision is reached it may be used as
a precedent

Donato's Bronze Trio May Not Toss Slim Ankles unci drapes

Must Giuseppe Donato's lovely bronze

in their narrow straw beds far back in
the dark of one of the city's storage
houses?
Or may the winsome trio yet toss
slim ankles and bunches of grapes
along the river front in the "Dance of
Eternal Spring"?
To erect the statuary will cost
money. City Commissioner Harry F.
Bowman had been expected to provide
the funds from the official purse of the
water department. Mr. Bowman, how
ever. said to-da}' that he hasn't the
wherewithal.
Ever since M. S. Hershey, the
"chocolate king," presented the Donato
fountain to the city all Harrisburg has
been rather expecting Mr. Bowman to
pay for setting it up. He cheerfully
offered to finance the erection of the
group when sites were being discussed.
Of several places talked of, Mr. Bow
man favored the entrance to Reservoir
Park at Twenty-first and Market
streets above all others. Incidentally,
he said he believed there would be no
legal hitch to his expending the money
from the water department, as the
fountains of the city are all under this
bureau's jurisdiction. The "art com

a site on the park front at the foot of
Locust.street. The choice was made
upon the recommendation of Park Ex
pert Warren 11. Manning.
Sculptor Donato at a conference
with the art commission some months
ago said the group could be erected at
a cost of $4,500 and that he would be
willing to bond himself to finish it
without charge to the city for any
amount above that figure.
When asked to-day when the work
will be started, Mr. Bowman said he
doesn't know. "So far as I know,
there are no funds for the purpose,"
he added. —■ ■
"Don't you mean to finance it from
the water department funds as you
were quoted as having suggested?" he
was asked.
"Well. I hardly see how this can be
done. The site that has been selected
isn't on water department property
and I don't believe we can use fund's
from that department for anything
that doesn't pertain to its property."
"Wouldn't this fountain be under
your department's jurisdiction?"
"Xo. I believe not. Our department
has jurisdiction only over the drinking
fountains."
So, from all indications, Mr. Donato's
nymphs will not dance this Spring in
the park.
