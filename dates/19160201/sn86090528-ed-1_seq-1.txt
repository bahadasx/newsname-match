DON'T WALK SO FAST."
She was young and pretty,
and she knew it. She was dress
ed in a most entrancing man
ner and style, and she knew
that also. She had on high
heeled shoes, pretty, but nut
calculated to insure safety of
locomotion along slippery, snow
and ice-covered streets. These
shoes were built for show, and
she knew how to show them to
the greatest possible advant
age. They were laced' behind
and they had tall tops, scollop
ed and bespangled and her skirt
vas j.'.st short enough to ad
mit of a glimpse of purple hos
iery peeping forth between the
tops of the shoes and the bot
tom of the garment. She was
with a lady companion and the
lady companion wore low-hecl-ed
shoes with rubbers over
them. The two turned the cor
ner at the First National bank
building In a hurry. "Held on,"
gasped the one with the high
heels on her pedal apparel,
"hold on! Don't walk m fast.
This sidewalk's slippery as
l.'iss! Hold on, I say! Whet!
Whoop! Dash it all, didn't I
ask you to go slower? Didn't
I tell you I couldn't walk with
these heels on this ice' Didn't
I tell you I'd fall? Laugh,
