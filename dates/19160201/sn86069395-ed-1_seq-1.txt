KITTY TO
L1VEAGAIN
Good Prospects For Baseball
For the Coming
Season.
NEW TALENT BE DEVELOPED
No
Team To Play More
Than Two Seasoned
Men.
At a meeting held here Sunday af
ternoon by representatives of Owens
boro, Paducah, Cairo and Hopkins-
ville it was decided to reorganize the
Kitty league for the coming season.
All those hero were enthusiastic over
the outlook and predicted a success
ful year. The keynote will be ccono
my, and the salary limit was fixed at
$800 for each club and no club will be
allowed to play more than two sea
soned men. This is to put the teams
all on a par as to material and to force
them to play ambitious youngsters
rather than high-priced older heads,
The schedule will be for one hun
dred games, but just when the season
will oppn was not determined.
While only four towns were repre
sented, it is believed no trouble will
be met in securing two possibly four
more. Those now in prospect are
Henderson, Clarksville and Bowling
Green, Vincennes may also come
back into the fold. No officers were
elected, but Dr. Frank Bassett, who
kept the league going for three sea
sons, presided and it is assured he
will be made president. Another
meeting will be held soon to perfect
the final details. In the meantime
efforts will be made to increase the
circuit to six or eight clubs.
Bowling Green Interested.
Bowling Green, Ky., Jan. 31.
Bowling Green lias a chance to geHn
to the "Kitty" baseball league, ac
cording to J. L. Arthur, athletic di
rector of the Western Kentucky State
Normal school. Dr. Frank H. Bas
sett, president of the league, has
written to Director Bassett, president
of the league, has written to Director
Arthur that he will be in the city one
day this week to talk over the matter
with the lovers of the national sport
about placing one of the league clubs
here. The salary limit has now been
placed at $800 per season, and this, it
is supposed, will bring it within the
peculiar limits of Bowling Green.
It is Arthur's idea to have a suffi
cient number of persons subscribe
for tickets to insure the success of
the enterprise. The Normal school
body would in itself form a nuclous
from which a professional team
could be made. It looks like Bowl-1
ing Green will raise the amount ru -

PRESIDENT'S
WARNING
"Afraid of the Danger
Shame," Unless
Prepared.
of
SPIRIT OF WAR MENACES
Cannot Promise To Avert
It and Maintain The
Honor.
Cleveland, 0., Jan. 31. President
Wilson, speaking, as he said, "sol
emnly," warned the nation that the
time may come when he cannot both
keep the United States out of war and
maintain its honor. He declared that
the country must be prepared to de
fend itself and must prepare at once.
"America is not afraid ofanybody,"
he said. "I know I reflect your feel
ings and the feeling of all our citizens
when I say the only thing I am afraid
of is not being ready to perform my
duty. I am afraid of the danger of
inadequacy; I am afraid of the dan
ger of not being able to express the
character of this country with tremen
dous might and effectiveness when
ever we are called upon to act in the
world's affairs."
The President spoke in Cleveland
to-night with more gravity and force
than he has shown durinc any of his
previous addresses on preparedness
He was applauded frequently and
when he spoke of defending the na
tion's honor the cheering was tre
mendous.
"Let me tell you very solemnly you
cannot postpone this thing" he de
clarcd. "I do not know what a sin
uie dav mav brintr forth. I do not
wish to leave you with the impression
that I am thinking of some particular
danger.
"I merely wish to tell you that w
are daily treading amidsf intricate
dangers. Tho dangers that we are
treading amongst are not of our own
making and not under our control. I
think no man in the United States
knows what a single week, a single
day, a single hour, may bring forth."
Again and again the' President
spoke of the nation's honor. He de
clared the real man believes his honor
is dearer than his life and a nation's
honor is dearer than its peace and
comfort.
Regret that the question has come
up in a campaign year wis expressed
by Mr. Wilson.
"Let us forget," he said, "tlmt this
is a year of national elections."
The preparedness issue, he added,
should have nothing to do with poli
tics. For the first time during his present
tour, the President spokit of the navy
and of the coast defenses. The lat
ter, he said, arc good in oiwlity, but
not in quantity. '
borne people say that the navy
ranks second, he declared, but the ex-
prt6 agree it ranks fourth. He add
ed it should be increased.
Among the possible sources of dan
gor moutioned by the President were
the difficulties growing out of the
protection of Americans abroad and
the' obligation of the United States to
maintain the liberties of the people
of tho Western Hemisphere.
