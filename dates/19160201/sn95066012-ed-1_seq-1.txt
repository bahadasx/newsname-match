hunter's disease of spirit - caused by
the celay while the taxidermist is

. ...
private natural history museum and
taxidery parlor and learned some
things he didn't know before which
of course isn't saying much, accord
ing to general knowledge and belief.
The mounting of deer heads is an
interesting piece of work, first, no
two heads are alike; second, no two
hunters are alike in the manner of
saving their specimens and delivery
to the taxidermist Some heads ar
rive with horns broken, skins nearly
ruined toy cutting In the wrong place
and other imperfections. But , every
hunter expects to receive a head so
life-like and expressive it would even
turn Teddy Roosevelt green. The
job of the skillful taxidermist is to go
ahead and do it. In this he beats
some reformers, 'although the work
may be less interesting.
The first operation in mounting a
head is to strip the skull of spare
flesh and leave it to dry. The skulls
cannot be boiled to secure this result
because it is necessary to leave a tuft
of hair around each horn bo the sew
ing of the dressed skin will not show
on the finished product. When the
skull has been cleaned it is then fast
enned in the top of a mould shaped
like a deer's neck. Plaster-paris is
turned into this, the head being fast
ened securely as the material dries.
In the center of this mould a piece of
hard wood has previously been insert
ed with which the head can be secure
ly attached later to the pol
ished back. Mr. Harrington's work
shop is in . his cellar and in
the height of the season it pre
enta ; a curious appearance. Long
rows of deer skulls with the weird
horns fastened In the neck shapes
taken from 'the moulds, are hung to
dry, this drying . process consuming
about ' two weeks. Eighty-three
skulls, horns and casts were strung
up In the cellar the. past month-, .
All the horns ; are lead-tagged, a
similiar tag being . fastened to . the
hide when the head arrives, The
skins meanwhile have,, -been 'treated
with .arsenic and other chemicals, and
are, ready for.-drawing over the, forms
and sewing about the same i time as
the skulls and casts are dried.-; ,;...
It is necessary at times to pad the
head after the skins have been drawn
on and' sewed. iSonie taxidermists use
a cast for the skull also, but utilizing
the original skull gives the head the
same shape and appearence it carried
in life. The placing of the glass eyes,
attaching to the back board is a mat
ter of detail.
But Mr. Harrington does not con
fine himself alone to the mounting of
deer-heads. A room in the north east
corner of his new house is a museum
of specimens -which lie has mounted
for his own amusement, or awaiting
delivery. He. started the business sev
eral years ago because vhe .wished to
preserve trophies of, his., shot-sun apd
rifle." He then began doing the work
for outsiders as he became proficient',
afterward exchanging '.'specimen's . or
buying birds and animals from' foreign
countries. ' lie how has "over a thous
and specimens of native and' foreign
birds and fur-bearing animals.'1' ";
He has mounted all the native song
birds, together wj'th ! specimens of na
tive foxes, coons and bob .; cats.
Among the difficult birds to procure
he has a whip-poor-will and a white
crow which he shot on the outskirts
of Bennington several years ago.
Some months ago he corresponded
with an English taxidermist and pur
chased several hundred specimens of
English birds which were shipped un
mounted. In his spare ' moments hp
has been working on these and adding
them to his collection. The business
has grown until it nets, him a tidy
sum each year outside his regular
trade of carpentering.
Mr. Harrington secured the' first
buck shot in Vermont the past year,
which, by the way, was brought down
by a lady hunter in Montpelier. He
also has sent him for mounting from
York state a buck's head with thirt
teen points on its horns. This la some
thing rarely discovered and Is valu
able as a curio. Twelve and fourteen
points are common, but a small freak
horn made this head of especial
value.
He also has in preparation an elk
head 'worth a good sum of money be
cause the animal is practically extinct,
the few specimens remaining being
carefully protected. .He is also
mounting the head of a huge bull
moose whose horns will measure near
ly seven feet from tip to tip. He
owns this head and will eventually
hang It in his sitting rom.
His museum is also furnished with
a life-sized stuffed bear and deer. He
also makes a speciulty of mounting
bear rugs .with the head and snarling

Norfolk, Va., Feb. 1. The British

The Appah was captured by a Ger

steamer in which two men were killed
and a number were wounded.
With the flag of Groat Britain dow n
and the double eagle at her mastr.ua i
the Appan made one of the most spec

The entire sea was patroled by hos

brought in safe.y to this neutral por.
On board the steamer were 30u pas

said. ., . ..
"We are not now thinking ,of inva

PROHIBITION ABLY
EXPOUNDED FOR
FAITHFUL FEW
Ex-Governor Patterson Talked
Well to Small Crowd
WANTS RATIONAL PROHIBITION
Saya Stat Prohibition is Not Effec
tive But is a Necessary Part of
Program. ,
Kx-Governor Malcolm R. Patterson
of Tennessee delivered an address in
support, of prohibition in Library Itall
Monday evening,-the hall being about
one third filled. .
Because of the small number "pres
ent, and also on account o flue fact
that Gov. Patterson had made the en
tire trip from Tennessee to Vermont
within the previous 24 hours, ho did
not deliver his main temperanco ad
dress advertised. Ho confined him
self to a forty-minute talk on his per
sonal experience with prohibition in
Tennessee and other stntoa, particu
larly in the south. r.
Rev. P. L. Dow acted as chairman
of the meeting, introducing Gov. Pat
terson. Dr. Madison Swadener .''
ndiana. Gov. Patterson's traveling
companion on thia , trip, who ws
schedulcd to speak alBO, could v
reach ; Bennington iu time.
The point of Goa. Patterson's c . .
tnent was that prohibition does pro
lilblf if given time enough and that .,
t!i riatiqnal trend of public senti- ,
ment is against liquor interests and
trafllfe. , It Is true, he ... stated, that
abuses creep in,, blind tigors and, ille
gal saloons and dives opeu u,i especi
ally iu the larger cities. ; But lining
up the different' states 6ne at a time,
against the liquor 'traffic1 by,-giving
them strict prohibitory 1 laws are
steps in a great . national uplift to
wean the federal government from be-
ing a partner in the traffic by permit
ting its continuance ' so long as the
government gets its share of the pro-'
fit.'-.- ' - ' - - -- : V;;
JThe moral effect of swinging Ahole
slates into line against the traffic tak
en from the view-point of a decade or
a ; generation, more than counterhal- ;
anccs the momentary evils of tempor- '
ary blind tigers or illegal saloons
which spring up while the good work
is being carried home.
The idea is, that once. given a suf
ficient number of states on record as
prohibitory, so that a majority of sen
timent in the country is against the
traffic, the prosecution of these illegal
places will be carried on much as ille
gal distilling is stamped out in the
mountain moonshine districts of the
south. .
It' fs 'difficult to get towns to enforce
a .prohibitory law; because the inhabi
tants do not back up their ' officers :,
'with' jxuMic sentiment and a law with- i
out public sentiment behind it, is no,'
lav;'1y,hateVefp'"."Let a majority of the?
federal states go dry, ' so tha-tv the,
liquor: supporters in.thi3 country are -in1
the minority, and transgressors of' ;
the selHng law AVill ..Hud themselves in '
as serious trouble " as the southern
mountlneers who are shot on sight if '
they attempt to offer resistence when
sught by federal officers.
The speaker maintained this could
not come without a great prohlbltion
ary movement uniting the entire
country. The trouble, he stated, in
any such reformatory law, is not In
the law, but in getting it enforced. It.
must bo enforced by some power
higher than the local petty govern-
inent and when it is, violation will be
so serious that the stales will havo
prohibition which really prohibits.
Gov. Patterson Avas chief executive
of Tennessee when a prohibition
measure came up in that state. Ho
had always been a local option man.
believing the discussion of the ques
tion once a year kept the issue alive.
The Tennessee legislature passed a
prohibitory law over his veto. Ten
nessee is not free from tho liquor
traffic any more than other states, but
he stated that in the final summing
up of benefits and evils resulting, he
was convinced the results Avcre in
,'avor of prohibition, and he now sup- '
ports prohibition.
The governor is a graphic and flu
ent talker. -He goes from here to
Rutland and Burlington where he will
rpeak in support of the Perry bill,
which is to be decided by referendum
March 7.
