Chicago, Jan. 31. The Vnited
States has made preparations for
iminediale war, as far as the navy Is
concerned, although the present na
val force Is Inadequate in size, Presi
dent Wilson declared tonight in an
address before several thousand per
sons in the Auditorium here. "We
mean business," he Bald, in speakinS
of the preparedness plans of the ad
ministration. "We have given to the present fleet
of the United States an organization
such ns It never had before, 1 am told
by Admiral Fletcher," the president
said. "And we have made prepara
tion for immediate war, so far as the
navy is concerned."
"The army," the president said, "us
at present constituted, Is not large
enough even for the ordinary' duties
of peace."
The president repeated his warn
ings that no time must be lost In
strengthening the defenses of the na
tion. Ho declared the government
was doing everything it could for
prepared ness.
"When I sec some of my fellow clt
irrns spread tinder where the sparks
are fulling I wonder what their idea,
of Americanism Is," the president
said.
. Country Cruelly Minjudgcd.
" America, the president said, had
been cruelly misjudged by the nations
at war. "I know that on the other
side of the water them has been a
great deal of cruel mlsJuilBmont with
regajjito -lhe reasons. America
has remained neutral. Those look
ing at us from a distance do not feel
tho strong pulses of Ideals and prin
ciples that are lit us.
"They do net feel tho conviction of
America that our mission is a mission
of peace and that righteousness can
not le maintained as a standard in
the midst of nnns. They do not
realize that back if nil our energy we
arc a body of idealists niii-'h mo-j
ready to lay d w n our liver, for a
thought than for a dollar.
"They suppose, some of them, that
we are' holding off because we can
make money while others are dying,
the most cruel misunderstanding that
any nation has ever had to face so
wrong that it serins almost useless
to try to correct it because It shows
that 'the. very fundamentals of our
life are not comprehended or under

Th, task -f the United States, he
said has bten to assert tne principles
of law in a world in which ihe prin
ciples of law nave broken down.
"We are not now thinking of In
vasion of tho territory of the United
States," the president declared.
"That is not what is making us think.
We are not asking ourselves shall we
be prepared only to defend our own
homes and our own shores.
"Is that all we stand for? To keep
the door Bhut securely against our
enemies? What about tho great
trusteeship set up for liberty of na
tional government in tbe whole wes
tern hemisphere'.' We stand pledged
to see that both the continents of
America are left free to be used by
their people as those people choose
to use them under a system of nation
al popular sovereignty as absolutely
unchallenged as our own."

The. president arrived in Chicago
from Milwaukee shortly after 6 p. in.
and was driven to tho hotel. loiter
he went to tho Auditorium which was
a rk.it of red, white and blue swung in
festoons from rails and boxes. Hack
of tho stage hung the American coat
of arms on a field of blue.
Tour galleries beside the main
floors were white with faces. Many
had sought in vain to obtain tickets
upd were turned away. Twelve hun
dred police held in check the sidf

Mayor Thompson of Chicago occu
pied a scat on the stage near the
president and Oovernor Dunne of

that may exist In your minds.
; "There Is no sudden crisis. Nothing
new has happened. I am not upon
this errand bccauiie of any unexpected
situiitlou. I have coinu to Confer with
you upon a, matter upon Which it
would, In any circumstances, be neces
sary for us to confer, when all the
rest of tin, world Is on fire and our
'own house Is not fireproof.
I World Thrilled With Passion.
"Kverywhore the atmosphere of tho
world is ihrllllng with the passion ot
a disturbance ituih. as tho world has
hevVr seen before, uiiil It Is first itecs
smy in the words Just tittered by jour
chairman, that we should see that our
own boii'e Is set In order and that
everything Is done to make certain
that we shall not suffer by tho gen
eral distill bance. There were some
dangers lo which this nation seemed,
at the outset of the war to be ex
posed, which 1 think 1 ran suy with
confidence, arc now pursued an I over
come. "America has drawn her blood and
her energy out of almost all the ra
tions of the world. It Is true of a
great ninny of us that there lies deep
lu our hearts the recollection of an
origin which Is not American. We
know that our roots, our traditions,
run back Into other national so ls ami
there are soi.ie songs thut stir ua.
There are some historical recollection,,
which engage our uffectlons and t!i

and pome error:1 of action, Hut I, foi

"I never doubted that the danger
was exaggerated because I hod learnt-d
long ago, nnd many of you will cor
roborate me by your experience, that
it is not men who are doing the talk
ing always who represent, tho real
sentiments of the notion. T, for ivy
part, alwnyu feel a sure confidence In
waiting for the declaration of the
principles and sentiments of the mi"
who are nol vociferous, do not iro
about seeking to make trouble, do
their own thinking, attend to tbel"

Pride of Am-estry.
"I, for my part, have no Jealousy of
family sentiment. I have no .lealoufy
of the deep aftVctiitu which runs back
through long lineage, it would be a
pity If we forgot tlie fine things that
our ancestors have done. Hut I also
know the magic of America. I n'so
know the great principle, which thrill
with emotion in the great body politic
to which we belong In the I'n'ted
Ht.ites I know the Impulses which
have drawn men to our shores. They
have not come Idly. They have not
come without conscious purpose to bo
free. Tliev have not come without
voluntary desire to unite themselves
with the great nation ,,n this side of

"And I know that whenever the. test
conns every man's heurt will be first
for America. And wherever they come
from. It was pr'nriple and affection
and ambition and hope that drew men
to these shores. And they are not go
ing to forget the errand upon which
they came and the America which
have m ule refuge and their hope will
lint suiter by any fori-etfulness on
their part. The trouble-makers have
