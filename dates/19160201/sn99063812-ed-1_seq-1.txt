Tho first allotment of national for
est money made to Oregon and Wash
ington in 1906, after tho passage of
tho act which gave the states a share
of tho national forest revenue, waa
$7,565 for Oregon and $1,823 for
Washington. In 1915 Oregon's share
of this revenue was $49,675, and
Washington's was $37,445. The con
stantly Increasing demand for na
tional forest timber assures a much
higher rate of Increase in the next few
years, and ultimately the statea will
receive a largo revenue from this
source.
Au Idea of tho beet sugar Induatry'a

from the fact that In one county
alone, Larimer, refining companies
have this year paid out approximately
$8,800,000 for the raw material sugsr
