the force at the Promotion Committee
office was kept busy throughout the

who will arrive during the Carnival.
The committee will aso take up with
the Great Northern the proposition of
housing the passengers on that ship
during the stay in the city.
The Promotion Committee has
urged the people of the city to submit
a list of the rooms that can be used
by the visitors. Although there are
still a few. rooms left at the. Hawaii

that there are many who have not yet
