PINE TREES INi
TIEJAST
Control of the Blister Rust
Planned by Federal Department
of Agriculture.
WASHINGTON, Fob. I?In order to
protect the white pine forests of the
country from the disease known as
the white pine blister rust, It Is proposed
to place a federal quarantine oil
shipments of Ave leaved pines and
cultivated black currants from several
eastern stales. A public hearing
on the question was held by the
federal horticultural board at the department
of agriculture, Washington,
nn February 4. The states which it
Is proposed to quarantine on this account
are New Hampshire, Vermont.
Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York,
and Pennsylvania.
The white pine
lllister liust
like citrus blight and blister blight,
is an imported disease which was in
"o,l intn tlilo n/timl rv nn tiiirsorv
Lt'UUUCCU illlU 11 i i fj uiiiiiii,. ?... j
stock before llic passage of the fed
cral plant tiuarantlne law. .Ninety perl
cent of the infections now in America |
came from a single German nuisery. i
The disease, it is said, can be controlled
in the eastern states, where It;
now exists, but if it finds Its way into
the western forests there is no llkell- (
hood that its spread can be successfully
cheeked. At the present time
these forests arc free from blister rust
and it can only be introduced into
them through nursery stock of five
leaved pines or currants. A quarantine
against the relatively limited traffic
in this stock Is, therefore, believed
to be a necessary precaution.
A3 an additional safeguard, it also is
proposed to prohibit the entry of five
leaved pine nursery stock from Can
ada and of nursery stocit or currants
and gooseberries from Canada, Europe
and Asia. These questions will be
considered at the same hearing as the
proposed domestic quarantine.
The Importance of protecting the
white pine forests from the blister
rust may be Inferred from the fact
that in Xew England. Xew York and
Pennsylvania alone there are still
fifteen billion feet of mature white
pine valued at not less than $75,000,000
and in the lake states, twelve billion
feet valued at $06,000,000. In the
enormous forests of the West the
white pine and sugar pine arc among
the most valuable trees. At a
Conservative Estimate,
there arc about thirty billion feet of
western white pine which are worth
at least $90,000,000. Of these, twenty
billion feet are in private holdings
and ten billion feet in nntional forests.
The value of (he mature sugar
pine is placed in the neighborhood of
$150,000,000 the greater part of which
is in private hands.
in addition to its effect upon this
standing timber, the spread of the
disease would seriously intcrfero with
the planting of trees. At the present
time the white pines are among the
nrinelnal varieties planted, not only
by private owners, but also by cities,
states and the national government.
If blister rust is allowed to become
prevalent, much land more suitable
for forestry than for agriculture and
which could otherwise bear splendid
forests of white pine will have to remain
waste or be devoted to some Inferior
tree. It Is estimated that In
New England, Xew Yqrk and Pennsylvania,
there are not less than ten
million acres to which this Is applicable
and that in the like state?- there
are another ten million.
The proposed quarantine will not
only be an additional^ protection to
the greet western forests, which are
naturally Isolated from the East byTreeless
Plains,
hut It will protect as .well those portions
of the eastern sfates which now

Despite the fact thut rain fell in

splendid attendance at the first
Methodist church, where Dr. Morrison
is doing such wonderful revival
work.
The sermon was another of those
mighty attacks upon the bulwarks of
sin and evil, and allowed the great
southern evangelist to be master of
his work, and, that his scope is as
wide as the universe ilelf, taking In
the wonders of God's goodness and

the very brink of perdition. The fact
that Dr. .Morrison dates to say and
do things at which many ministers of
the Gospel would hesitate, lias won
for him the respect and admiration
of every class. He Is positively no
respecter of persons and has made
more than one hardened old sinner
feel that his fiery holts were directed
at. him alone. Hut It cannot he said j
that the revivalist is a harsh man?.
far from it- he Is kindly aud gentle
in his manner, often sweeping his
hearers from smiles or sober thoughtfulness
to sobs and tears. He is certainly
doing a great work In the city
and the outlook was never better for
a successful revival.
At the close of the meeting a number
of men camo down the aisles to
thp altar and knelt In humble attitude
before God and man, confessing
the Christ. The great evangelist,
feeling that perhaps some of those
present desired to leave asked that
all who so wished might go home, but

the church. The personal workers
were busy and the meeting took on
the form of nn old-fashioned revival,
one in which a great deal of actual
good Ir bound to be accomplished.
The music last evening was exceptionally
good. Prof. Hintt having the
entire audience Join with the big
chorus In rendering the numbers.
Dr. King Is greatly pleased with
the outlook at present and feelR that
from this time forward the meetings
will be the scene of a harvest of souls
and a mighty uplift In general for the,
city.
The noon luncheon for nten was
inaugurated today, and will continue
as In the days when Dr. Hamilton was
holding the tabernacle meetings In
