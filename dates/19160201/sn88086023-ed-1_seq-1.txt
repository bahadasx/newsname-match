Though the situation i not regard,
ed as serious in Umatilla county at
this time the continued snow and
cold has been working hardship on
cattlemen and sheepmen. The chief
trouble arises from excessive expense
of feeding high priced hay and grain,
but there are also reports of actual
losses of sheep and cattle
There is an unofficial report from
Condon that a sheepman in that sec
tion lost 700 head of ewes. Both
sheep and cattle are known to be in
peril around Spray and around Lone
Rock, west of Heppner.
ST. ANDREWS CATTLE
DYING
St Andrew's Mission, on the Uma
tilla reservation, haa lost five head
of cattle, and it la feared there will
be further losses oat of ltO head
owned by the mission.
The supply of feed at the mission
is almost exhausted and the cattle
are getting weak. The feed consists
of straw and alfalfa. Major Swartx
lander has invited the mission peo
ple to drive their cattle to the In
dian agency where there la a supply
of feed. However, this will not be
done as It would be too hard upon
the cattle. The snow Is three feel
deep at St. Andrews and it was still
nowing at 11 o'clock Mils morning.
The plan Is to feed the cattle as long
I as possible and rely upon hauling
j feed to them when the storm breaks
