DU PONT EXPLOSIONS
:i NOT WORK OF SPIES
The Company Alleges That All the
- Fatalities Were Result of Accidents.
Wilmington, Del.. Jan. 31. The Du
Pont Powder company, - with head
quarters in this city, issued a state
ment today in which the officials de
nied that any of the recent fires and
explosions at the-various plants, which
resulted in many deaths and injuries,
had been caused toy spies or any in
fluence over which they could be said
to have control.
The statement was made by C. B.
Landis, who is authorized to speak for
the company and was prompted by
Friday night's five fires at the plant
at Carney's Point, N. J., opposite Wil
mington. These fires caused the death
of four employes, the injury of three
others and the destruction of 8100,000
worth of powder and property.
- The Du Point company brands as
false the statements that any of the
fires or explosions followed warning
notices, which are said to have been
posted on trees and fences near the
Carney's Point plant and at the Haglev
yards, a few miles from Wilmington.
All the fatalities were from accidents,
the company alleges, it being added
that the Du Pont secret service is in
vestigating the fires to. see how such
fatalities can be avoided. This Inquiry
Is not being conducted in the thought
that the fires were the work of spies
or anyone antagonistic to the com
pany. MOST SUCCESSFUL, HERRI NG

NOT CAUSED BY PUBLIC .OPINION,
SAYS WILSON '
INVASION NOT FEARED
President In Advocating Preparedness
Declares Make Good On Trusteeship
of the Whole Western Hemisphere
No Time to Be Lost.
Chicago, Jan. 31. The United States
has made preparations for immediate
war, as far as the navy is concerned,
although the present naval force is in
adequate in size. President Wilson de
clared tonight in an address before
several thousand persons in the Audi
torium here. .
"We mean business," he said. In
speaking of the preparedness plans of
the administration.
- Navy ia Prepared.
"We have given to the present fleet
of the United States an organization
such as it never had before, I pr told
by Admiral Fletcher," the president
said. "And we have made preparation
for immediate war, so far as the navy
is concerned."
The army, the president said, as at
present constituted, "is not large
enough for . the ordinary duties of
peace." .
No Time to Lose. .
The president repeated his warnings
that no time must be lost in strength
ening the defenses of the nation. He
declared the government was doing
everything it could for preparedness.
"When I see some of my fellow citi
zens spread tinder where the sparks
are falling, I wonder what their ideal
of Americanism Is," the president said.
America Cruelly Misjudged.
America, the president said, had been
cruelly misjudged by the nations now
at war.
"I know that on the other side of
the water there has been a great deal
of cruel misjudgment with regard to
the reasons why America has remained
neutral. Those looking at us from a
distance do not feel strong pulses of
ideals and principles that are in us.
Our Mission a Mission of Peace.
"They do not feel the conviction of
America that our mission is a mission
of peace and that righteousness can
not be maintained as a standard in the
midst of arms. They do not realize
that back of all our energy we are a
body of idealists much more ready to
lay -down our lives for a thought than
for a dollar. -
J'They. suppose, some of - them, we
are WKfingr off. because- we- can-aaake-twwq
money - while others are dying, 'the
most, cruel misunderstanding that any
nation has ever had to face so wrong
that it seems almost useless to try to
correct. it, because it shows that the
very fundamentals of our life are not
comprehended .or understood."
Rulers Brought About the War.
Rulers, ' not public opinion, brought
about the present war, Mr. Wilson de
clared.
I thank God there is no man in the
United States who has the authority
to bring on war without the consent
of the nation," he said.
The task of the United States, he
said, has been to assert the principles
of law in a world in which the princi
ples of law have broken down. -
We are not now thinking of inva
sion of the territory of the United
States," the president declared "That
is not what is making us think. We
are not asking ourselves shall we be
prepared only to defend our own homes
and our own shores.
No Selfish Purposes.
"Is that all we stand for? To keep
the door shut securely against our en
emies? What about the great trustee
ship et up for liberty of national gov
ernment in the whole western hemi
sphere? We stand pledged to see that
both continents of America are to be
left free to be used by their people as
those people choose to use them under
a system of national popular sove
reignty absolutely unchallenged as our
own.
At this moment the Americas are
growing together upon that handsome
privilege of reciprocal respect and de
fense." Detailed plans for strengthening the
army and navy and the aviation corps
and for making munitions and arma
ment by the government were outlined.
The president spoke for nearly an
hour.

Tidings
of Submarine K-5
NO UNEASINESS FELT BY - OF
FICERS OF OTHER BOATS
HINT ENGINE TROUBLE
Steamer D. A. Canfield Reported What
Appeared to be the Missing Vessel
Sighted Off Coast of Florida at 5:30
P. M. Yesterday.: - -
Washington, Jan. 31. Despite the
continued absence of any word from
the submarine K-5, missing since Sun
day morning, naval officials here, in
cluding Secretary Daniels and rank
ing officers in the department, were
confident tonight-that the under-water
craft had not come to harm. They be
lieved that the vessel either had proceeded-as
ordered to Key West or had
developed some trouble with Us en
gines which caused its temporary sep
aration from its sister ships.
Thorough Search Ordered.
Every effort vas made, however, to
locate the K-5 and definitely estalTsh
its safety. Captain Bryan, com
mandant of the navy yard- at Charles
ton, S. C, the nearest station to the
poin ir where the vessel was last seen,
was ordered to direct a thorough
search. He advised the department
late today that three destroyers, two
coast guard patrol boats and the buoy
tender Mangrove were searching for
the K-5.
Th confidence of officials here was
based on the following reasons:
Not to Stop at Ports.
"The vessel was in command ot
Lieutenant R. C. Grady, who also was
in charge of the division, including the
K-l, K-2 and K-6. His sailing orders
directed him to take the division from
New York to the southern drilling
grounds off Key West, not stopping
at any port en rouie.
The fact that the three sister ships
of the K-5 and the convoy Tallahas
see put into Charleston was due to
troublesome weather' and dense fogs
and could have been accomplished
with knowledge of Lieutenant Grady
and while he was continuing south.
No Uneasiness Among Officials.
Captain Bryan reported that there
was no uneasiness among the officers
aboard the submarines accompanying
the K-5 and that - they - believed it
probably had proceeded to Key West.
The K-5'8 wireless sending radius
recently, was reduced to approximately
25 miles and would be limited to ten
or .fifteen miles by unfortuate weath-
BepaTated",Dy' a" greater' distance
than its wireless covered it would be
unable to report its location although
it could receive inquiries from other
snips.
Charleston and Key West are seD-
arated by a three day cruise for sub
marines and there are no wireless sta
tions between with which the K-5
coluld communicate.
Never Submerged on Cruise.
- submarines on a cruise are never
submerged, particularly in -time of
peace because greater -speed and safe
ty are attained when running on the
surface. vessels the size of the K-5
carry an additional weight of approx
imately nrty tons when under way.
aval constructors familiar with the
K class boats said it was Inconceiv
able that one would sink from the
surface. .
Engine Trouble Possible.
It was thought the K-5 might have
developed engine trouble or its wire
less had become deranged. Neither of
tnese possibilities was viewed as en
dangering the vessel itself.
The four K boats had Just completed
an extensive overhauling of their en
gines in the New York Navy yard and
were believed by officials here to have
been more than equal to the cruise to
Key West. At no time since the K
class of boats were commissioned in
1914 has any of them developed any
sernjus engine irouoie.
Vessels Scattered For Days.
. Submarines frequently are submerg
ed in rough weather while cruising,
particularly at night and in fogs and
although normally under specific or
ders, their operations in such instances
become more or less independent. In
recent manoeuvres the vessels have
been scattered for days at a time be
fore collectiong in unit formations but
on every previous occasion they have
been safely assembled.
MAY HAVE SIGHTED
MISSING SUBMARINE
Off
the Florida Coast News Sent by
Steamer D. A. Canfield.
Washington, Jan. 31. A navy de
partment despatch from Charleston to
night said that a. steamer naa report
ed sighting what appeared to be the
missing submarine K-5 off the Florida
coast.
The department despatch follows:
"The following despatch has been re
ceivod from Jupiter Inlet. Fla.: -
"Steamer D. A. Canfield reports

5 at 6.30 p. m. January 31, twelve miles
north of Jupiter, bound south. Signed
Caotain Fenn."
Department , officials said that It is
the K-6 proceeding on her natural
course for Key West,- her position at
5.30 p. m. would have been virtually
that reported by Captain Fenn.
