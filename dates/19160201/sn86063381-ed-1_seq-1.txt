Discuss Plans for Maintaining*
Parlors.

Board Meets in St. Paul
February 8.
ASKS COUNTY TO RETURN
PORTION OF BRIDGE LEVY
The Bemidji Rest Room may be
moved to the basement of the public
library. Most of the city council
members and a number of business
men favored this plan at a meeting
of the city council when the ques
tion of maintaining the Rest Room
was taken up.
Committee is Appointed.
President Lycan of the council ap
pointed the building committee,
composed of Aldermen Phillippi,
Smart and Moberg, to confer with the
committees of the business men's as
sociation and the commercial club to
investigate the library plan and
other plans and to report at the next
meeting of the city council.
Business Men Present.
There were a number of business
men at the city council meeting last
evening. E. A. Barker, president of
the Merchants' association, told the
council of the Rest Room, its origin
and how it had been maintained up
to the present time by the women of
the Study club. Pie asked that the
council investigate the feasibility of
the city taking over the project.
Spending Citizens' Money.
President Lycan explained to the
business men that it was the citizens'
.money that would be spent by the
council and that if the Rest Room
idea was feasible and worth the
amount of money paid, and if there
was a strong endorsement by the peo
ple of the project, the city council
would make arrangements for the
city to take over the room.
it was pointed out that although
no record was kept at the present
time, about 300 to 400 people visited
the Rest Room each month.
Willing- for City to Act.
F. C. Troppman told the council
that he believed that the project was
a good tiling and that he would be
willing to have the city take it over.
G. D. Backus stated that in his
opinion the rooms were of much
benefit to the city and that they
should be maintained by the city.
He stated that he thought that it
would be advisable that the rooms be
connected with some public building,
such as the city hall or library.
"It is a public benefit," said Mr.
Backus, "and as public funds are to
be spent, the rooms should be se
cured at the least possible expense."
Suggests Library.
Alderman Lahr suggested the use
of the basement of the library for
the rooms. By increasing the salary
of the librarian it was believed that
the library could be kept open later
than it now is. Alderman Lahr's
suggestion was favored by many of
the aldermen and business men
present.
Armory Question Up.
Many matters came before the
city council last evening, including
the proposition of a new armory for
Bemidji.
"How many want an armory?"
asked Lieut. E. A. Barker of the
naval militia. All members of the
council favored the project and ad
vised Mr. Barker that the city would
uphold its side.
Board Meets Feb. 8.
Mr. Barker stated that the Armory
board would meet in St. Paul, Feb. 8,
and that if Bemidji were to have an
armory an application would have to
be presented then. He submitted a
plat of the proposed site and stated
that there was some objection by peo
ple in the immediate neighborhood
of the site. By moving the building
ten feet more toward the lake it is
believed that much of the objection
will be overcome. The council mem
bers were unanimous in the opinion
that the present site is the "finest
site in town."
Salaries Considered.
The council last evening named
the salaries of the city officials for
the ensuing year. The salary com
mittee was split in regard to the sal
ary of the city attorney.
Alderman Ervin stated that he was
of the opinion that Bemidji is pay
ing a higher salary than most cities
this size and that the salary should
be cut to $50 per month.
Alderman Bailey favored the pres
ent salary of $70 per month.
Has Much Work.
City Attorney Russell stated that

OUTRAGEOUS ACTS
TO ENFORCE LID
Illinois Solon Tells Congress of
Women's Baggage Being
Searched.
Washington, Feb. 1. Charges
that officers of the Indian bureau
performed outrageous acts in the ad
ministration of the Indian liquor law
in Minnesota were made by Represen
tative Chipperfield of Illinois in the
debate on the Indian bill in the
house today. Mr. Chipperfield de
clared that one of these officials, W.
W. Thomason, had opened the bag
gage of a friend of his daughter,
while she was at the railroad station
in Duluth and spread her most in
timate and personal belongings.
"When I protested against the out
rageous conduct," he said, I was
told by the Indian bureau that the
deputies charged with the enforce
ment of the anti-liquor law were do
ing this and would continue to do
it regardless of the personal feelings
of the travelers. Somewhat the
procedure has been followed by the
customs officers in Northern Minne
sota. This matter is not political,
as the same things were done while
the Republicans were in power."
Mr. Chipperfield produced Thoma
son's card, which contained the fol
lowing. "You can't always, perhaps
not even often, tell by the looks of
a, well, say a suitcase, what may be
inside, and it's always interesting,
at least, and sometimes exciting, to
look in and find out."

daring feat of the war was revealed
today when the missing British
steamer Appam, flying a German flag,
sped into Hampton Roads at 5:45

prize crew aboard.
Captured by Twelve.
Twelve Germans, presumably from

British warships that were patrolling
the American coast and reached this
port.
Unparalleled in History.

paralleled in history. A score of
German prisoners were aboard the
Appan and were being taken to Lon
don. It is believed that these were
liberated and armed and that they
helped the raider crew.

thrilling as any private story. Lieu

aboard the Appan and took command
of the ship.

came here on account of being sure
of decent treatment.
