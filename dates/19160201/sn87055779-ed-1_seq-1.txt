International News Service;
NORFOLK. Va., Feb. 1. The
British liner Appam. which was re
ported to have been lost off the
African coast, arrived in port today
a Herman prize of war.
It was reported when the Appam
steamed into port that a Oerman
prize crew was on board and tho
(lerman flag at her masthead, that
she had been captured by a Herman
submarine, but several hours later
it was learned that she had been
taken by an armed German tramp.
The capture was made off the
Canary islands and the vessel cross
ed the Atlantic, a distance of ap
proximately 4.2C0 miles, with a prizo
crew on board and the German com
mander on the bridge.
Among the persons nn board the
Appam were passengers taken from
other British ships which had hern
sunk bv the nrmeil German tramp.
Aided by Civilians.
There were 22 men in the prize
crew, but they were aided by 2 0
(Jerman civilian prisoners who had
been on board the Appam when she
was seized.
When the Appam left Pakaar o;i
the west coast of Africa for Plym
outh, on Jan. 11, she carried 160
passengers. 20 German citizens who
were being sent to Kngland for in
ternment and a crew of 1 5 T men.
Farly morning mist hung heavily
over the surface of the harbor when
the weather-beaten Appam steamed
slowly into port shortl;' after
o'clock this morning. Sailors on
other ships could not believe their
eyes when they saw the German
flag hanging limp at the masthead.
As soon as it was learned that tho
ship was British and that she was
in command of a Gorman prize crew
the port authorities got Into com
munication with the master of the
vessel.
Tn the meantime reports Hew
thick and fast and it was said that
the ship had been captured by a
German submarine of thn "dread
naught" typ in mid-Atlantic and
had been brought across by a score
of men.
Was Taken Prisoner.
As soon as the Appam dropped
anchor. Lieut. Berg, of the German
navy, hastened nshor to pay his re
spects to Col. Haines. F. S. com
mander at Fortress Monroe. It was
not until after this visit that the
fact? of the captute became known.
Then it wns learned that a rusty
German tramp with guns mounted
on her decks, had intercepted the
Appam in the Atlantic steamer lane
off the Canary islands and had made
a prisoner of her. The tramp had
on board 13K p?sengers taken from
other British ships which she de
stroyed and these were transferred
to the Appam.
The German commander had
painted out the Appam's name mi
the ship's strn. but the name was
plainly visible upon her lifelHats,
Collector of the port. Hamilton,
went on board the Appam shortly
after her arrival to make an investi
gation. Lieut. Berg said he was not sure
whether the ship would be interned
or whether he and his men would
put to sea again, taking the chance
of capture.
In the meantime representatives of
the British government at Washing
ton had been notified and action was
started to gain control of the vessel
for her British owners.
Appam K Overhauled.
"On Jan. 1". four das after the
Appam left port, she jvas overhaul

islands-.
"The tramp, which was recognized
as German, opened fre. in the mean
time signalling the Appam to heave
to. The Appam tried to flee, but the
shells from the tramp began falling
on -board and when several persons
had h en wounded it "was dec
give Up.
"When the German silb-rs board

sunk seven other British merchant
ships and that they had 1 3 S per.son

"After a council it was decided to
transfer the prisoners to the Appam.
