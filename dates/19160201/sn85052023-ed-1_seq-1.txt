ICE PLANT FOR MORELAND
West End Hustlers Plan to Supply
A Big Territory
L. F. Steele, of Hustonville, and
George B. Pruitt, of Moreland, two
of the West End's "livest wires," are
planning an ice plant for Moreland.
They propose a stocTc company and
stock in it is already going rapidly.
The two gentlemen will be heavy
holders, but prefer to have a jiumber
of people of the community interest
ed, that the"y may have their co-operation.
Mr. Steele, who is the chief
promoter, says he is confident that
the ice plant will pay an annual div
idend of from 10 to 15 per cent from
the start. The field for operation is
certainly a most excellent one and
located right on a switch at More-1
land, shipping to all points North and'
South would be an easy matter. There
is no ice plant between Danville and j
Somerset and none in Casey. The ,
proposition seems a most feasible one
and it is not surprising that the stock
is meeting with such ready sale.

CANDIDATES
ARE LIMITED
In Amounts They May Spend For
Office in Corrupt Practice Act
Passed by House.
The corrupt practices bill, which
is designed to purify elections in Ken
tucky was passed through the House
at Frankfort last week. It is known
as' an Administration measure, and
has the approval of Gov. Stanley. A
peculiar feature of the act is that it
permits candidates for some offices
to fspend in winning the offices al-.
most as much or more in one instance
than the office is worth. The meas
ure as adopted fixes the maximum
amount of money that may be spent
by any candidate for an office in
Kentucky, including the primary and
general elections. The amounts fol
low: Governor, $20,000; other state
officers, $10,000; Railroad Commis
sioner and Judge of the Court of Ap
peals, $6,000; Circuit Judge and
Commonwealth's Attorney, $5,000;
county officials in counties having ci
ties of the first class, $5,000; county
official in counties having cities of
the second class, $4,000; county of
ficials in counties having cities of the
third class, $3,000; county officials in
all other counties, $2,000; Represen
tatives, $700; Senator, $2,000; for
any other office, city, county, or dis
trict, not mentioned, $1,000.
The bill repeals the statute which
requires two witnesses to convict for
bribery in elections.
Donations of campaign funds by
corporations or individuals to candi
dates who hold positions -requiring
them to assess the property of the do
nors, and coercion by corporations of
their employees to vote for any can
didate are made unlawful.
Amounts of money spent, by candi
dates-must be filed for publication 15
days before and 15 days after the
election. A fine of not less than $100
nor more than $1,000 is fixed as a
penalty for violating the act.
No mention is made in the act of lo
cal option, municipal bonds or con
stitutional amendment elections.
To Reimburse Cattle Owners!
Favorable report will be made to
the Senate by the Committee on Ap
propriations of the act providing for
the reimbursement, of owners of cat
tle destroyed by legal authorities
during the foot and mouth disease"
epidemic. The Committee consider
ed the bill and heard Dr. A. J. Payne,
of the United States Bureau of An
imal Industry, and Dr. S. F. Mussel
jnan, State Veterinarian, describe
the necessity of destroying animals
affected with the disease. About
$68,000 will be needed to settle the
claims in this State and already this
amount has been paid out by the
Federal Government which agreed to
stand fifty per cent of the loss.
Fourteen States have settled their
claims and Kentucky and Maryland
are expected to make appropriations
this year.
Two meausures affecting the De
partment of Agriculture were intro
duced by Senator Zimmerman. One
provides for the repeal of the sta
tute in regard to commercial ferti
lizer, reducing the fee from 50c to
25c per ton, and transferring the
enforcement of the law from the Ex
periment Station to the State Board
of Agriculture. The other amends
the statutes by "making it the duty
of the Commissioner of Agriculture
to enforce the act relating to the
State Board of Agriculture in collect
ing fees for commercial feeds.
Wants to Raise Salaries.
Senator Stricklett introduced a
bill to increase the salary of the
Commissioner of Agriculture from
$2,500 annually to $4,000 annually,
and create the office of Assistant
Commissioner at a salary of $2,500
annually.
A bill to repeal the charter of the
town of Dunnville, in Casey county,
has received favorable consideration
from the committee to which it was
referred. Dunnville -very probably
has gone back into the village class.
Jennings Maupin related to many
Lincoln county people,, has announc
ed as a candidate for the democratic
nomination for county clerk in Mad
ison county.
How Mrs. Davis Got 'Rid. of 'a Bad

SUIT FOR $20,000 DAMAGES
r, Jf . "T
Filed by Mrs. E. C. Eubanks Against
i? Miss Terah Moore.
The Lexington Herald last week
contained the following which is of
interest here as Mr. Eubanks is a
prominent and highly esteemed young
farmer of the Moreland section of
thishcounty, and his friends regret
veryjmuch that such a situation has
arisen in his family affairs and hope
veryjmuch that, matters will be ar
ranged so that harmony can be re
stpr'wLand the suit, which is mention-ed,-jwrthdrawn.
The Lexington Her

E. ;JC. -Eubanks, of Danville, yester
SayjTfiled, suit in the Fayette Circuit
.Cout against Miss Terah Moore, of
60Syre Avenue, this city,- for dam
age ifrtiie SUm of $20,000, charging
that; 'Miss Moore is responsible for ,
thej alienation of her husband's af
fections; thereby causing him to de
yefbpVa' settled aversion to her and
destroying permanently the happi
neaetaRsl peace of mind of the plain-
tifp:
MieerMoore last night emphatically
denied nail the charges made in the
petition and said that E. C. Eubanks
haq .never beea a visitor at her home

doneanything that might give cause
for'THch an action on the part of
Mrs.'Eubanks, who, Miss Moore saiij,
is her first cousin.
Mies Moore, who formerly resided
in'jBoyle county, where she taught
schoelji said that she moved away
frorajDanville to get away from her
relatives there, coming to Lexington,
analresides at her home on Sayre
Avenue. Miss Moore says that she
beheves the cause of the suit grows
out of some old trouble caused when
David Moore, of Lincoln county, Mrs.
Eubank' s father, who was adminis
trator' of the estate of her father,
failed to wind up the affairs of the
estate satisfactorily and she was
forced to employ an attorney. She
says that she now believes that the
present action is caused through
jealousy and by the fact that Mrs.
Eupanks was not remembered in the
-wmSs'f-Miss Moors's; father and'.that
sne is now trying io ODtain Dy this
suit some of the money she thought
should have been left her in the
will.
Miss Moore says that she has been
friendly with the Eubanks family, but
that Mr. Eubanks was never in her
.home except during her father's last
illness', when he came to be with him,
but at the time her uncle, David
Young, of Lexington, was also in the
house on the same mission.
Andrew S. Moore and, John W.
Rawlings are attorneys for Mrs. Eu

LANCASTER SAFE
BLOWER CAUGHT
Lexington Police Nab Yeggman Who
Is -Believed to Have Done
Job In Garrard.
A yeggman, who gave the. name of
G. R. Grant, of Chattanooga, but
who was identified as J. W. Rice, of
Lexington, is believed beyond all
doubt to be the man "who jobbed the
depot and , McRoberts' drug store at
Lancaster last Wednesday night, or
early Thursday morning. The man
was arrested by officers while at
tempting to rob the safe of the In
dian Refining Company in Lexing
ton, and was caught right in the act.
Because- of the equipment found on
him, he was believed by the police
to be an expert cracksman and one
who had "pulled many jobs."
Following a conference between
Chief of Police Reagan, Chief of De
tective Brown and Captain V. G.
Mullikin at Lexington, conclusive ev
idence that Rice blew the safe of the
Louisville & Nashville depot at Lan
caster and robbed McRoberts' drug
store last week was obtained. Cap
tain Mullikin was called to Lancaster
and with his bloodhounds tracked the
Lancaster bandit for some distance,
but lost the trail in the railroad yards.
A sample of the soap, used to hold
the "soup" in cracking the depot safe
was brought to Lexington by Captain
Mullikin, and was identical with the
soap found on Rice when arrested
there. A watch and the "dope" out
fit found on Rice were identified as
articles stolen from the Lancaster
drug store. The ticket agent at Lan
caster told Chief Brown over the tel
ephone that the description of Rice,
tallied with that of a man who pur
chased a ticket for Lexington Thurs
day. A conductor for the Louisville
& Nashville railroad also declared
Rice to have been a passenger on his
train from Lancaster to Lexington.
The cracksman who broke the de
pot gate left a finger print on a
piece of soap at the scene of his job
and this will be sent to the Lexing
ton authorities for the comparison
with the prints taken by Chief
.Brovn. .Rice,,, stoutly, denied that he
had committed the Lancaster rob
beries. Chief of Police J. J. Reagan, of
Lexington, declared that he believed
that within a week, the local officers
would learn that Rice was wanted in
many other cities.
Ticket Agent Patterson of Lancas
ter went to Lexington with the con
ductor on the train upon which Rice
rode from Lancaster. Mr. Patterson
identified Rice as the man who bought
a ticket for Lexington from him
Thursday. The conductor stated that
Rice came to Lexington on his train
that morning from Lancaster. A
sample of soap used in cracking the
depot safe was declared to be iden
tical with the large lump in the kit.
The syring and "dope" pellets found
in the kit in possession of Rice when
arrested were identified by the de
tectives as sfolen from McRoberts'
drug store in Lancaster. Chief
Brown stated that Rice has. never de
nied complicity in. the robberies men
tioned, but when pressed with the
accusation stated, "Well, chief, you
caught me with the goods on in this
Refining Company affair, so why wor
ry about any others?"
PROMINENT WOMAN DEAD.
Mrs. Martha Pollard, wife of S.
H. Pollard, died at her home in Lex
ington of pneumonia a few days
since. Besides her husband she is
survived by five children. Deceased
who was 72 years old and a most
excellent Christian woman, was a sis
ter of Mr. F. M. Ware, of McKin
ney, and Mrs. Josiah Bishop, of Hus

ers and sisters are: Mrs. Perkins
Gragg, of Somerset, Mrs. Brent
Gragg, of Sacramento, Cal., J. F.

Paris, 111., and Mrs. "Lizzie Dutton, of
Lexington. The burial occurred in
the Lexington Cemetery.

GOES ON IMPORTANT MISSION
W, H. Wearea Represents Millers
Before Congressional Committee
W. H. Wearen, of this city, sec
retary of the Central Kentucky Mil
lers' Association left Saturday eve
ning for Washington, D. C, to rep
resent that body before the congres
sional committee which has in charge
the Rainey bill which seeks to repeal
the present inspection tax on adul
terated flour. Mr. Wearen was se
lected for this important, work at a
meeting of the millers of the Blue
Grass part of Kentucky at Lexing-'
ton last week. The present tax was
imposed, the millers declare, during"
the Spanish-American war as a war
tax, and made the manufacture of
flour adulterated with corn flour or
starch known to the consumer. It
provides also for the labelling of
the product and licensing of millers
who would make it. Their present
agitation, they declare, is in the in
terest of honest, flour. Representative
Rainey's bill, they say, would take
the matter out of the hands of the
revenue" office and place it under the
pure food and drug department, and
would remove the penalty for the
manufacture of the mixture. Under
the tax method of inspection the
government can inspect, mixed flour
at all points. Under the Federal
pure food law, the government's ju
risdiction would stop at the State
lines, and would cost, the State, it is
declared, if the measure is repealed,
at least $10,000 annually to see that
the labelling is complied with in the
home markets.
ROCKCASTLE BONDS VALID.
There was general rejoicing thru

illegal. This movement has delayed
road construction more than half a
year. Work will be xushed from now
