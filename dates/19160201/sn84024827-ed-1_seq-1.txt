ArmyNot Large Enough for
Ordinary Peace Needs Is the
Statement of the President
Woodrow Wilson Given Ova
tion in Chicago Where He
Tells Citizens of Lake City
of Our Unpreparedness.
SAYS NAVY IS IN FAIR
SHAPE AT PRESENT
'We Are a Body of Idealists
Much More Ready to Lay!
Down Our Lives fcr a

CHICAGO, Jan. 31. "We have been
given in the present fleet of the Unit
ed States an organization such as it
never had before, I am told by Admiral
Fletcher," said the president in his
. preparedness address here. "We made
preparations for immediate war, so far(
as the navy is concerned. The army,
a sat present constituted, is not large
enough even for ordinary duties In
time of peace."
The president repeated the warnings
that no time must be lost in strength
ening the defenses of the nation. He
declared the government is doing
everything it could for preparedness.
"When I tfee my fellow citizen
spread tinder where sparks are foiling,
I wonder what their ideal American
ism is;" he said. The warring na
tions had cruelly misjudged America,
he said. "They do not feel the con
viction of America that our mission is
peace, and that righteousness cannot
be maintained as a standard in the
midst of arms," he said.
Continuing the president said:
"They do not realize that back of
all our energy we are a body of ideal
ist much more ready to lay down our
lives for a thought than for a dollar.
They suppose, some of them, that we
are holding off, because we can make
money while they are dying the most
cruel misunderstanding a nation ever
had to face, so wrong that it seems
almost useless to try to correct it be
cause it shows the very fundamentals
of our life are not comprehended or
understood." The rulers, and not
public opinion precipitated the present
war. the president declared.
"Thank God there is no man in
the United States who has the au
thority to bring on war without the
consent of the nation," he said. "The
task of the United States has been to
assert the principles of law in the
world in which the principles of law
were broken down. We were not think
ing of an invasion of the territory of
the United States. That is not what
is making us think.
"We are asking ourselves shall we
be prepared only to defend our own
homes, shores. Is that all we stand
for?' To keep the door shut securely
against our enemies? What about the
greatest trusteeship set up for the
liberty of the national government in
whole Western Hemisphere. We stand
pledged to see that both continents
of America are left free to be used
by their people as they choose to use
them under the system of national.
popular sovereignty as absolutely un
challenged as our own."
The president arrived at Chicago
from Milwaukee at six o'clock. He
was dripen to a hotel. Later he went
to the auditorium, which was a riot of
red, white and blue. The back of the
stage was set as an American coat of
arms, the main floor, galleries were
white with faces. Many vainly sought
to obtain tickets. Twelve hundred po
lice held in check o nthe sidewalk
the throngs, clearing the streets en
tirely of traffic between the hotel and
the auditorium. The entrance of the
president was heralded by the playing
of the "Star Spangled Banner." The
crowd stood and applauded. Mrs. Wil
son occupied a box.
SPEAKS IN MILWAUKEE.
MILWAUKEE, Jan. 31. Speaking
before a larbe audience today, the
president declared the men who say
Americans will not stand together in
time of trouble "have shot their bolt."
"I have not supposed the men whose
voices seemed to show the threat
against us represented even the peo
ple they claim to represent." Many in
the audience were of foreign birth.
The president declared he knew the
men who came from foreign lands
loved liberty and would stand by the
ideals in America.

ROUND-UP NETS
Three Men Arrested by Sher
iff and Deputy at and Near
Douglas. One Already Had
Charge Pending.
TOMBSTONE, Jan. 31. (Special) !
Sheriff Wheeler and Deputy Percy
Eowden returned this morning' from
a trip to Douglas and along the
Borderland Route east of Douglas in
the vicinity of Chiricahua and Ber
nardino, where they went in search
of bootleggers. They were successful
in capturing three men and were the
means of stopping several shipments
of liquor they were scheduled to ar-;
rive in there Saturday night.
The first man to fall In their clutch
es was G. W. Stone, who was in a
wagon and 'had about thirty cases in
the bed of the vehicle as well as five
gallons of alcohol which was to have !
been used in the manufacture of boot
leg in Douglas. Stone had the bottles,
in the wagon having taken them out
of the cases. As soon as bte officers
took' Stone to Douglas they returned
to Bernardino and while going through
the mud they ran across Any John
son and William Murray, of Bisbee,
In a Studebaker car In which were
about twenty cases that had also been
taken out of the cases. They took
them to Douglas where they were
both given examinations and held
under $1,000 bond each. Last night
Sheriff Wheeler caught P. E. Burke
as he stepped off the Golden State
Limited with two. suit cases filled
with whiskey. Both Burke and Stone
will enter pleas of guilty and will
soon be added to the road gang.
The officers bring stories of other
dealings of the bootleggers. M. A.
Patterson, who formerly ran the
saloon at Rodeo, a few days ago, sent
out a man with a wagon to bring in
a shipment. The man secured the
shipment and started back with it
but decided that he might make mors
out of it If he ditched the whiskey I
and to' d that it had beef taken from
him. Ke went bac"; n Ddiigl.ia Jii'dl
informed Patterson that two deputy!
sheriffs had taken the whiskey away
from him. Patterson started out to
investigate and then the man admit
ted that he had hid the whiskey. When
thev went to find it, however, the
whiskey was gone. A dry farmer
along the road had witnessed the hid
ding of the booze and as soon as the
teamster drove off he went to the
place with his waeon (and loaded it
up and now has about thirty cases of j
good whiskey that he says he intends i
to keep for his friends and will not!
sell any of it. He has made arrange
ments to see that it is nlaced in a
safe nlace so that it will not be stolen, j
Another lot of bootlereers had a
shloment in Douelas and when they
learned that Wheeler and Bowden
were in town they disnosed of it at
reduced prices and left for El Paso.
Johnson, mho was arrested, is at
the present time under bond for the
same offense and will have his trial
soon. Murray has already served a
term for Introducing whiskey and will.
no doubt, have another chance toj
work on the road. Johnson claimed !
to the officers that he received the
whiskey on this side of the line but
I admitted that he had paid a man tin
. to put the whiskey over on the Ari
zona side for him and that it cost him
about $250.

At Current Rate One Pound
of the Rare Element Could
be Sold for Fabulous Sum.
Gram Brings $120,000.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31. More !
than $9,000,000 a pound would be j
the price asked for redium were j
that quantity of the valuable j
metal available and fore sale at I
one time. Late in 1915 there J
was sold in this country one one j
one-tenth grams of radium (ele- j
ment) at the rale of $130,000 a j
gram, according to a report is-
sued today by the United States
Geological Survey. The entire out
put of the United States last year,
however, was only 6 grams, or
about 1-76 of a pound avoidupois.
The European was caused a great
slump in the production of radium,
as in 1914 there were 22.3 grains
"The United States has the
largest known radium-bearing de
posits In the world," says the
Geological Survey, "but the mar
ket for radium is mostly In Eu
rope, for. although Americans like
to feel that they are sufficiently
progressive to take holf and use
to the full new discoveries, in
ventions, and processes, yet the
Eureopean municipalties and hos
pitals have been buying and util
izing most of the radium pro
duced. When the war began,
therefore, causing Eureopean mo
ney to flow Into other channels,
the demand for radium fell off so
greatly that there was practically
no market for radium or uranium
ores in the early part of 191 F. and
verv little market during any part
of the year."
As a result of the collapse of
the radium market, mining of
radium-bearing ores except for
such work as was necessary to
hold claims, was nearly slopped.
Through the efforts of the experts
of the United States Bureau of
Mines a process has been develop
ed by whirh radium has been pro
duced at a cost of $37,S99 a gram.
The principle fields of the rndium
boaring ores are In Volorado and
Utah.
