Adopts

wards German-Americans
Milwaukee, Jan. 31. President
Wilson's campaign to inform tno
country of the gravo dangers it must
face unless tho army and navy aro
strengthened adequately was contin
ued today with renuwed energy. "
His (schedule for today called for
flvo speeches in Illinois and Wiscon
sin states where the- so called hy
phenated settlement denounced by
him in his last message to congress
abounds. The president spoko from
the observation end of his 'private, car
at Waukegan, 111., and Kenosha and
Racine, Wis., this morning. Ho will
deliver a cet speech In an auditorium
at Milwaukee this afternoon and in
tho evening will make another in tho
Auditorium at Chicago. --
The president made public a tele
gram he hud sent to Senator Ollio
James to bo read at a meeting of Hun
garians in New York last night, which
io accepted as a keynote of the con
ciliatory attitude ho is taking in ad
dressing German-American audiences.
In it tin president asserted his con
fidence that the body of fftrolgn born
Americans in the United States' have
not divided their loyalty.
Tho president feols that he can ap
peal with confidence to tho foreign
born citizens of tho country as a body
for "their 'support of the measures he
cdvocatos as critically necessary to
guard against a' great national dan
ger. It was pointed out further that
his tour on the stump Is designed to
awaken the country to the need for
preparedness in all its aspects.
Just now the president's advisers,
who accomnany him on the trip are
unwilling to predict how far he will
go In pressing his arguments for de
fense. One thing is said to be cer
tain; he will go just as far as seems
necossary to convince the country
that it fanes serious perils, against
which precautionary measures should
ho taken. His willingness that the
country should construe his refer-"
inces to foreshadowed dangers as ap
plying to the controversy with Ger
many or our difficulties with Great
Britain has convinced his, friends tiyvt
the customary bonds of rostraint In
discussing diplomatic matters havo
teen loosened. ( Inasmuch as he re
gards 'ho danger of wtpreparedness as
critical because of tho new conditions
created by developments in our In
ternational relations, the president is
cald to believe ho would be recreant
in his duty if he failed to take re
course to any steps which promised
to bring tho people" to an adequate
realization of these dangers.
Mr. Wljson feels that his Btumping
tour has begun mo3t auspiciously. His
private secretary, Joseph Tumulty,
end evory other member of the parly
as well, is openly enthusiastic at tho
manner In which the president has

President Wilson spent Sunday in
Cleveland. At 11 o'clock he drove in
an automobile to the Euclid Avenue
Presbyterian church, where he list
ened to a sermon by Rev. Alexander
McGriffln, a student nt Princeton dur
ing Mr. Wilson's presidency' of that
institution. The president's visit to
the church was unexpected. Mrs.
Wilson accompanied him. A heavy
fog lay over Cleveland all day, turn
ing at times Into a slight downpour,
but this did not prevent Mr. and Mrs.
Cleveland from going on a motor trip
through the park system which sur
rounds the city. The presidential
party went to the president's private
car at the Union station shortly after

United States Marines Check
Looting in Stricken Districts.
San Diego, Cal., Jan. 31. Looting
described by Rear Admiral Pullam,
commanding the Paciiic reserve lleet,
as "the worst I have ever seen," broke
cut in the Otay valley, flood swept by
the breaking ot tho Otay dam last Fri
day. The lower, valley was turned
into an armed camp, patrolled by ma
rines and sailors from the battleship
Oregon and the cruisers Milwaukee
and South Dakota in San Diego bay,
.lth orders to shoot looters on sight.
The sailors and marines tolled hard
to I recover the bodies of thoso who
lost their lives In the disaster and
twenty-eight bcdles, somo of which
were mutilated, were recovered. The
loss of life in the Otay valley now is
estimated at fifty, while- reports that
the cloudburst In San Luis Rey and
San Pasqual valleys cost no more
than ten lives, brought the probable
ueath list in this section to sixty.
A-' now flood poured down the Tia
uana river, which has risen four feet
at its mouth at the foot of San Diego
buy.
Officials hero said that this undoubt
edly indicated 'the bursting of the Mo
rena dam, sixty miles back in the
hills. Fearing that the 15,000,000,000
gallons of water Impounded by tho
dam would tear a new channel for the
river across tho Coronado strand into
the sea, residents of Imperial Beach,
a hamlet on the strand, were ordered
to fieo. '
First news of tho reported collapse
of the Morena dam came through An
drew Ervast, city engineer of Core
i ado. Ervast. trying to reach the
Mexican town o! Tijuana, met a Japa
rese running, along the bank of the
Tia Juanr, rlvei1. "Get back," cried
rne Japanese In broken English. "Tell
people lots of water coming."
Ervast could see a four foot wave
coming down the river. He turned

Toledo, Jan.' 31. Professor Scott
Kearing of Toledo university assailed
President Wilson for his chnngo of

"President Wilson's change of front,"
said Nearing, "came colncidently witn
the flush periods of United States

company and ether great Industrial
organisations. President Wilson's pre

TENSION STILL EXISTS
OVER LUSITANIA ISSUE
German Reply Not Expected Be
fore the End of the Week.
Washington, Jan. 31. Tension over
the Lusltanfa issue continues to exist
in, administration circles, in the ab
sence of official confirmation of press
reports from Berlin that Germany is
preparing to send to the United
States a new note, which will meet
tho demands of the American govern
ment. That the German embassy has like
wise received nothing to substantiate
lhce reports was Indicated by the
fact that Count Von Bernstorff is still
absent fiom Washington. Attaches of
the cmtjaasy express the opinion tha.t
nothing reunite as to the position of
the Hcrlin .government is likely to
reach Wcphington before the end of
the week.
Secretary Lansing is keeping in
close touch by telegraph with Presi
dent Wilson, and the fnct that the
president's warning to the p:blic
In his speeches appear to b taking
en a graver arrect is accepted In o'JI
clal circles' here as meaning that tho
messages ho gets from Secretary Lan
sing are not reassuring. ;
In state department quarters tho
opinion Is expressed that at the end
of another week it will be definitely
shown whether Germany Is to give
tho disavowal demanded or Is willing
that there should be a severance of
diplomatic relations between the two
countries. Officials here continue to
insist that such a severance will be
inevitable It tho next reply from Ber
lin is unfavorable.

GERMANS EXTEND
THEIR ADVANCE
Capture important Heights in
the Vicinity ot Loos,
MORE THAN 1,200 MEN TAKEN
French Still Fighting Desperately to
Regain Positions Lost In the Neu
vllle Sector Fifty Persons Killed
or Wounded In Zeppelin Raid On
the City of Paris Review of Oay's
Operations.
London, Jan. 31. Tho German ad
tano in the sector west of Pen one,
announced as including the village of
Frise and 1,093 yards of French
trenches, has been extended, accord
icg to an official ,German statement
until it covers a front of 3,500 meters,
to a depth of 1,000 meters. This Is
the greatest single gain made by the
Germane in all the attacks of the re
cent offensive, which began about
NIeuport and extended south about
Neuville-Vaast and finally to the dis
trict of Perrone.
British troop.; were among the pris
tcers reported by the Germans. The
number of prisoners claimed by tho
German statement is 17 officers uau
1,270 men. The French are still fight
ing hard to regain the positions lost
in the Neuville sector.
The new offensive gives tho Ger
mans, as perhaps the most important
result so far, possession of Hill 14C,
tetween Souchez and Vimy, and Hill
fO, southeast of Loos. France. These
hills were won by the allies in the
Ecptcmbet offensive, the first by tho
French and the second by the British.
Together the Vllly heights command
the Arras-Lens roads, which are a
most important .factor in the posses
sion of Lens.
The present attack by the Germans'
en these positions is regarded as an
anticipatory measure, against a pos
sible offensive by the allies in thi3
tector in the spring. With the heights
named in the possession of the Ger
mans the task of the allied forces in
r.ttempting the capture of Lens would
be greatly increased.
Air Raids On Paris.
Fifty-two persons were killed or
wounded in Saturday night's Zeppelin
3 aid, according to complete reports.
Nine women were killed and 14
wounded; 14 men were killed and 15
wounded. Ten houses were damaged
by the raiders. Three houses were
the scene of eight killed and injured
each. In another house seven per
sons were killed or injured.
One or the bouses In which the
most serious damage was done was a
home in which the family had met to
celebnto the return ot a son, a
Zouave, on leave of absence from the
front. Around the table were the
grandfather, his daughter, the latier's
husband, an aunt, two sons and a girl
oi fifteen years. Seven mutilated
corpses were found In the wreckage
cf the house.
The effect of the raid has been only
,to reproduce tho effect of the former
raids. There is no sign of panic, but
angrv indignvtlon is- shown and de
mands are made that each -aid shu'i
be answered ' an aeroplane raid on
a Gorman :o:i
h ' The fact that only one Zcpi.-elln par
ticipated In the raid leads to tho !)
lief that the raid waj merely a fore
iunner of other rn.ds to come. It js
calculated that tlu aircraft trav.!i-!d
at thj -lite of rixty miles an hour.
Sunday night the people of Paris
were startled by firemen passing
through the streets sounding an alarm
of another Zeppelin raid. The city
immediately was darkened. Haif an
hour later the lights were being turn
ed on, the firemen having signaled
that the alarm was over.

Alexander Fosters the Measure. I
In tlie House.
BITTER FIGHT ANTICIPATED:
fvfeasure Provides For a Government.
Owned Merchant Marine, Operated'
In Part by the Government In Con-Jun-tion
With Private Capital Ad
mir.ntratlon Urges the BUI as Part
of National Defense Program.
Washington, Jan. 31. The admin
istration bill providing for a govern'
ment owned merchant .marine, oper--tedinpart
by the government in con
junction with private capital, was pre
sented in the house today by Repre
sentative Alexander of Missouri,,
chairman of the committee on mer
chant marine and fisheries.
The bill is the same in principle as'
the shipping measure that failed in
the last congress. It contains the gov
ernment ownership provision and
there is no limit of life of the pro
posed law. Under this bill the gov
ernment would own ships and v.ould
operate them in trade in opposition
to tho cargo carrying companies that
now do biisiness on the seven seas.
The new shipping bill does not meet
tho approval of Representative Kltch
in of North Carolina, Democratic
leader., He says he will fight it from--the
drop of the hat, as will Represen
tative Fitzgerald of New York and'
other representatives.
In presenting the shipping bill in
congress it is the purpose of the ad
ministration to urge it as part of the -national
defense program, as indicat
ed in a statement by Chairman Alex
ander, which he made public, accom
panying the text of the measure. "AH
agree' that we need a great merchant
marine, not only to carry our over
seas commerce in time of peace,- but
and quite' as Important as a naval
auxiliary, in the event of war," said?
Chairman Alexander.
Provision Is made for the creation;
of a shipping board to be composed
of the secretary of the navy and tho
secretary of commerce as ' members,
ex-officio. and three commissioners to
be appointed by the president. This
board, with the approval of the presir
den, is authorized to construct ves
sels in American ship and navy yards,
or to purchase or charter vessels,
with a view to chartering, leasing or
selllng such ships for use in the for
eign trade between tne United States
and Its Insular possessions and it
the coanwlse trade. To raise th
money to build, buy or charter 'ihips
r50.000.000 worth of Panama bonds is?
cuthorizeu. It is expiessly stipulated
that vessels leased by the board to
