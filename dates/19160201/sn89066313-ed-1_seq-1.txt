Milwaukee Audience.
SPEAKS IN CHICAGO
Wishes, He Declares, to Re

Directly to People.
ISv I ntteil Press
CHICAGO. Feb 1 -President Wil-
s-oii, speaking before a crowd that
filled the Auditorium Theater last
night, sabl that lie. as repres.niaine
of the people, was making his present
tour to report directly to the people
on the state of the Union.
President Wilson said:
-Mr. Chairman and Folio w-Citizons:
"You put me under a great obliga
tion to you by the generosity of your
reception. And I am quite aware that
it is largely because you know how
desirous I am to speak to you with
the utmost frankness upon some of
the most essential issues of our na
tional life.
"The Constitution of the United
S'ates explicitly lays upon the Presi
dent the duty of reporting at the be
ginning of each annual session of Con
grees to the representatives of the
people concerning the state of the
Union. And it seems to me that it is
a very natural inference from that
command that the President should
from time to time, when unusual cir
cumstances arise, make his report so
far as it is possible for him to do
so directly to the people themselves.
"To Explain a Few Matters."
"It is with that conception in view
hat I have taken the liberty of com
ing to you tonight. I have not per
mitted myself the privilege of leaving
my duties at Washington very often,-
because they have been very exacting
and verv anxious duties and there is a
very clear sense in which it is my
duty to be constantly there and con
stantly watchful of the changing cir
cumstances of the day. But I thought
that you would feel me justified in
the unusual circumstances of the time
if I lef- my duties there for a little
while and came to explain a few mat
ters to you."
A small army of picked detectives
and mounted policemen guarded the
streets. Plain-clothes men were
strewn among the crowds outside the
thea'er and the hall.
Speaks in Milwaukee.
Before coming to Chicago President
Wilson spoke in Milwaukee to an
audience of 9,000. He declared the
men who say Americans will not stand
together in time of trouble "have shot
tiieir bolt."
"I have not supposed that the men
against us represented even the people
whose voices seemed to show a threat
they claimed to represent," he said.
The President spoke to an audience
of 9,000, many of whom were of for
eign birth. He declared he knew the
men who came from foreign lands to
America loved liberty and would stand
by the ideals of America.
He appealed to all Americans to
support the Government in its na
tiojial defense plans.

YICAMION-WIDE
National Jubilee Month to
Be Observed Throughout
the United States.
STARTED IN 1866
Membership Is Now 342,948
Owns Property Worth
Millions.
Throughout the United States, be
ginning today, the Young Women's
Christian Association starts its na
tional jubilee month celebrating the
fiftieth anniversary of the founding
of the first association, in Boston,
Marcli ."!, 18UG. Nine hundred and
sixty-six associations, including city,
county and student, have developed
and exist today as the result of that
first association, which was started by
a society of women to help self-sup
porting girls who came to the city to
seek employment.
The organization membership in
America today numbers 342,948. The
association owns millions of dollars
worth of property in buildings In
which hundreds of thousands of
young women go for education, recrea
tion, to make friends and to find a
place to live. Beginning with a nation-wide
membership rally today, the
jubilee month will be filled with cele
brations and events.
To Present Pageant.
February C and 7 will be pioneer
days, on which every member of the
organization, past and present, will
report back to the local association
which was her first interest. On
February 22 the historical pageant,
"Girls of Yesterday and Today," will
be presented in every association
building in the country. This will be
four-act play in which the Girl of
1866 and the Girl -of 191G will in-
terpre: through the medium of the
other members of the company, the
scenes that pass before them. There
are only two speaking parts in the
pageant. On March :'. will be cele
brated the fiftieth birthday of the as
sociation's work in America.
Other pioneer associations bearing
the name of the Women's Christian
Associations were organized in Hart
ford, Conn., Providence, R. I., Pitts
burgh and Alleghany, Pa., in 1S67.
Cincinnati, Cleveland and St. Louis
followed in 1S6S by forming similar
societies. Similar associations were
formed in St. Joseph, Mo., Scranton,
Pa,, Kansas City, Mo., Minneapolis,
Minn., and Toledo, Ohio. All city as
sociations emphasized religious meet
ings and Bible instruction and as early
as 1872 the New York City Y. W. C.
A. commenced a Bible class which
shortly developed an average attend
ance of GOO.
Started Employment Agencies.
Employment agencies have always
been an important part of association
work. In 1872 Hartford, Conn., erected
the first building for this purpose.
The first association summer home
was built at Asbury Park by the
Philadelphia association In 1874. In
1891 Kansas City opened the first self
serving lunch room, now known as
the cafeteria.
In 1866 a convention was held at
Lake Geneva and the National Young
Women's Christian Association, which
later became the American Commit
tee with headquarters at Chicago, was
formed.
SCIEXTIST TKAINS GOLDFISH
Edwin 1. Haughton, Ohio aturalist,
Says They Have Brains.
I!y United Tress
MARION, Ohio., Feb. 1. Edwin P.
Haughton, a local natural scientist,
today informed the world that gold
fish have brains. Haughton owns an
aquarium of trained goldfish which
he says he has educated from a
naturally low mentality to a high
state of intellectuality, proving that
goldfish have brains if one just takes
the trouble to develop 'em.
Haughton has trained bis goldfish
to answer the dinner bell. When he
rings, the fish dart to Hie surface,
their mouths wide open, for their
daily feed. Haughton's aquarium is
made of concrete, twelve feet in dia
meter and several feet in depth. In
the course of a long period of instruc
tion, the natural scientist says, the
fish were taught to come to the sur
face in summer and to a hole in the
ice in winter by the ringing of a tiny
bell.

Patriotic Decorations Feature
M.U.'s Twentieth Annual
Military Ball.
Flags, bunting, crepe paper stream
ers, red, white and blue electric lights
and red, white and blue ice cream,
cake and peppermint candy afforded
a patriotic setting for the twentieth
annual Military Ball, which was held
In Columbia Hall last night. Thirty
five cadets spent two days putting up
the decorations. A long strip of red,
white and blue bunting was stretched
entirely around the hall and was
wound in the railing of the balcony
and the banisters leading up to it.
Seventy-five hundred paper streamers
were hung from the ceiling, from the
middle of which was suspended the
University's big 18 by 30 foot flag.
The chandeliers were covered with
red, white and blue crepe paper to
harmonize with the rest of the decora
tions. At various places on the walls
small flags were hung. Just below
the orchestra platform the University
gatling gun stood, draped in red.
white and blue. The balcony of the
hall was draped with many long rib
bons of paper, hanging from the cen
ter chandelier to the four corners of
the room. The lights here were also
covered with colored paper.
At 9:13 o'clock the dance began.
Cadet Colonel II. B. Gibson led the
grand march, with Miss Martha Meri
wether. He was followed by other
cadet officers, "non-coms" and privates
and their partners, arranged accord
ing to rank. Lieutenant C. McII. Eby,
commandant of cadets, in whose honor
'he dance was held, wore the United
States Army blue full-dress uniform.
The grand march broke up into a
quick one-step, and the dance was
under way. Officers, "non-coms" and
privates mixed freely, no distinction
of rank being observed, the Mili
tary Ball being the melting pot of the
Cadet Corps.
A two-course supper was served
after the sixth dance.
Twcn'y dances, lasting until 1
o'clock, were on the program. A five-
piece orchestra played. The pro
grams were of black leather with an
American eagle staniped in gold on
the cover.
