Takes Too Long to Rise.
"We are perfectly aware of the dlf

planes. The modern Zeppelin has a
pred of SO miles an hour. Suppose it
is at a given moment over a given spot
at a height of 11,000 feet An airplane

with the enemy when has has arrived.
Hard 1o Damage Zeppelin.
"The matter is not easy, on account
of the difficulty not only of locating

that it certainly will meet som kind
