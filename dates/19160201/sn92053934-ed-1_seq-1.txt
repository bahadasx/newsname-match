Whether the captor was a German :
C-boat or a hitherto unreported Ger- ,
man auxiliary cruiser is undetermined, j
From what was learned by some of the
.iM.T. Ko ho Aa,r, it i
uu.Liaio u.. y,, ... :
believed that some steamer, armed as j
.German auxiliary, raiding shipping off j
the African coast, took the British :
liner and put the prize crew abroad. ;
This view is supported by the fact that I
submarine could hardly have spared
i lieutenant and such a large crew to
a prize.
Elude British Cruisers.
Lieutenant Berge of the German
nary, placed on the Appam when she
Tas captured, brought in the prize,
eluding the cordon of British cruisers
across the Atlantic, and adding to the
historic chapter of German exploits at
sea, a chapter to rank with the adven
tures of the Emden, the Prinz Eitel
Friedrich and Kron Prinz Wilhelm.
There are 451 persons aboard the
ship, including 138 survivors of seven
ships sunk by the raider which cap
tured the Appam ; 20 German civilians
being transported from Africa to Eng
land to be placed in detention camps; i
15a members of the Appam's crew; 116 j
original passengers on the Appam and
the prize crew of 22.
Many of the passengers on the Ap
pam are women and children. There
are also several high British colonial i
officials who were returning to Eng
land from Africa.
There are also four wounded sailors,
taken from one of the sunken ships,
Mch resisted capture and was
shelled.
Seven Vessels Sunk.
According to information from the
ew who talked with Lieutenant
Berge the Appam was captured with
out resistance on Jan. 15, the day the
British news reports said wireless
communication with the vessel sud
denly ceased. A prize crew was placed
on board and the same day the raider
hich captured the Appam gave chase
to another British steamer, bound for
Australia with a cargo of meat. The
Beat ship gave battle, was captured j

THE-WAB-TODAY
The Russians have driven the
Turks from territory 41) miles in
length in Asiatic Turkey and the
Turks are now in retreat down
the Mush valley. I'etrograd also
announced that the Russian army
will leave the mountains where it
has been pursuing the Turks and
descend "into the plains which
are more favorable for wintering
troops. The Turks have been driv
en into the fortifications at Er
zerum and the London Daily Mail
correspondent at Athens learns
that the Turkish first army corps
will be sent to their relief. The
Italians and Austrians are en
gaged in another artillery battle
along the Isonzo front.
The Germans claim to have re
tained all the ground taken on
the western front near Neuville,
although the French have attacked
repeatedly.
On the eastern front the Ger
mans have bombarded several
Russian towns northwest of Riga
to the middle Stripa. The Russians
say they surrounded a detarh
ment of Austrian on the middle
Stripa and annihilated most of
the number, the rest being cap
tured. '
One of the most stirring marine
happenings of the war dcvelojM'd
today with the arrival of the miss
ing British steamer Appam at
'ewport ws with a German
prize crew on board. She had been
captured Jan. 15 off the Canary
islands by a German submarine
while on her way from Dakar, Af
rica, for Plymouth, England.
The passengers aboard the Ap
pam, which days ago was given up
for lost, originally included high
colonial officials of the British
government.
The status of the Appam from
the viewpoint of international law
has yet to be determined.
Last night's Zeppelin raid ap
parently was not directed at Lon
don, the course of the raiders ps.
sibly being the great mannfactur
Ing center of Manchester, and ap
parently being Intended to destroy
munitions factories. Xo details
of the damage done have been re
ceived. What is believed to have been an
attempt at a third air raid on Paris
within three days was foiled by
the lookouts on the French front,
uncording to Paris advices.
The situation at Erzenim Is, ac
cording to a report, more serious
for the Turks than previous ad
vices have indicated. There are
said to be W),OO0 men under Field
Marshal von der Goltz locked np
in the city with only two weeks'
provisions on hand.

lengthy editorial on the note, in which
it states that it does not relieve in

seeks to conceal how greatly "Anglo

conviction that if America really car

that will thereby accrue to Germany
will outweigh the disadvantages; it

I) EM'S CHICAGO SPEECH.
Rulers, not public opinion, brought
about the present war. I thank God
there is no man in the I'nited States
who has the authority to bring on war
without the consent of the nation.
I need not tell my fellow citizens
that we have not held off from this
struggle from motives of self-interest,
unless it be considered self-interest to
mantain our position as trustees of the
moral judgment of the world.
Another year has been added, and
no man can competently say whether
the I'nited States will be drawn into
the struggle or not. Therefore It is ab
solutely necessary that we should take
counsel together as to what is neces
sary that we should- do.
And the United States as the great
est and most powerful of the disen
gaged nations has been looked to to
hold high the standards which should
govern the relationship of nations to
each other.

CROWDS SURGE TO CAR
Nation's Chief and Party
Appear on Observation
Platform.
With cannon booming and whistles
blowing while thousands were shout
ing welcome, a dinning demonstration
which lasted throughout his entire
stay in this city greeted Hon. Wood
row Wilson, president of the United
States, as his special train pulled
into the Thirty-first street station of
the Rock Island lines shortly after
2 o'clock this afternoon.
After being roped back from the
tracks until two other trains had pass
ed from the station, the crowd surged
towards the rear car in the president's
train", which was occupied by the pres
ident, Mrs. Wilson, Secretary Tumul-
tv. and T)r Gravsnn On the nhserva-
tion pIatf0rm of the car the president
i and nis party appeared.
As the president's special left Mo
line the presidential salute of 21 guns
from Rock Island arsenal, ordered by
Colonel George W. Burr, command
ant, was sounded. No sooner had their
resounding echo died than the whistle
on the city waterworks was blown.
This was a signal for the other fac
tories to join In the demonstration,
and there was a din which continued
until the president had arrived in ths
city.
Call For Mrs. TVilson.
When Mr. Wilson appeared on the
observation platform the cheering in
creased in volume and the president
bowed and smiled. The president con
tinued to smile for about one-half
minute when, someone near the car
cried :
"Where's Mrs. Wil6on?"
The president raised his hand as if
to quiet the crowd and disclose a se
cret, saying:
"She's better looking than I am.
I'll ask her to come out," responded
the president to the suggestion of
Mayor McConochie that he present
her.
Mrs. Wilson donned a cloak and hat
and when she presented her appear
ance the crowd gave a loud demon
stration to the "first lady."
Mrs. Wilson retired back ot the pres
ident. This did not please someone
in the gathering who cried:
"Don't hide your wife."
The president slipped his arm about
Mrs. Wilson's waist and drew her to
the front of the railing, while the
crowd gave another demonstration.
Augustana college students gave
their yell and the high school pupils
followed.
"What's that?" the president asked.
Someone answered: "College yell."
"If I didn't have a cold, I'd give the
Princeton yell myself," the president
replied.
"Where's your speech?" someone in
the crowd cried just before the special
pulled away.
"I'm not loaded for a speech," the
president said.
During the time the train was stop
ped police saw to it that the children
were not crowded against the car, and
the president reached far over the
railing to shake hands with a score or
more of little tots, who will long re
member the hand clasp. Each hand
shake was given with a benevolent
smile.
Besides the president and Mrs. Wil
son, Secretary Tumulty and Dr. Gray
son, secret service men were station
ed on the back of the platform. Oth
er detectives surrounded the observa
tion car, while the police mingled with
the crowd as a protection to the presi
dent. The president wore a dark gray
felt hat and dark coat, the same as
many pictures of him show. Mrs.
! Wilson wore a small hat trimmed with
a band of plumes. She was attired
in a sealskin cloak and wore a dress
of light blue. She continued smiling
to the crowd.
