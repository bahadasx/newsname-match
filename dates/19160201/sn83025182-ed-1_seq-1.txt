NORFOLK, Va., Feb. 1.—The most
jaring feat of the world war was re
realed today when the missing British
liner Appam, flying the German Hag.
sped into Hampton Roads at 5:45 a.
m. with a German prize crew aboard.
The Appam, with i\,6 passengers and
crew of 134 was believed to have
foundered in a heavy storm or to have
been torpedoed off the west African
coast two weeks ago while enroute
to England. She had been given up
as lost by her British owners.
instead, the big liner was captured
by German soldier* presumably from
one of the kaiser's Monster TJ boats.
They headed her about through heavy
teas, raced across -the Atlantis sad
eluding British warships patrolling
the American coast, reached port
today, their movements curtained only
by a light fog.
The exploit of the German sailors Is
Without parallel'In history.
United States immigration and cus
toms officials immediately went aboard
the Appam, barring all other persons.
Full details of the capture were not
obtainable for several hours, the of
ficials remaining aboard to Question
captive officials and passengers. There
was no official confirmation of the
report that submariners made the cap
ture, though it was reported on shore
that a boat halted the British liner
off tbe strait of Gibraltar while she
was proceeding from the French port
of Dakar, in Senegal to Plymouth.
Only twelve Germans comprise the
prize crew that captured the 300 Brit
ishers, according to first reports reach-
The 166 passengers, including it is
reported. Sir E. M. Meriwether, gov
ernor of the British province of Sierra
Leone and his wife and civilian mem
bers of the crew, probably will be
permitted to depart, when the Appam
is formaly interned as a German prize
of war.

The Appam made Its audacious
dash Into port with the German flag
fluttering at its staff, recalling the al
most equally daring feats of the Ger

Wlihelm and Prince Eitel Friedrieh.
The capture and flight of the Ap
pam across the whole stretch of the
Atlantic, eluding British scout cruis
ers and all other shipping, in charge
of a bare handful of Germans, sur
passes fiction of the sea.
With lights out, at slow speed, zig
zagging out of the ordinary Atlantic
commercial channels to avoid meeting
any British vessels and with her wire
less muffled, the Appam's trans-At

tore and flight leaked out in meagre
and tantallzingly slow details.
Her passengers were held on board

GREAT FLOCK OF ZEPPELINS

(United Press Leased Wire Service.]
KON'DON, Feb. 1.'—A squadron of
twenty Zeppelins, some of them equip
ped with new silent motors, has been
maneuvering over Belgium for several
toys, preparing for a great "air-drive"
oe London, according to Amsterdam
dispatches today.
The raid upon the eastern, north

during the
thrilling flight across the Atlantic:
how the passengers were confined and
how the scanty German prize crew
navigated the vessel through the At

tails yet to be learned.
Immigration officials today found
twelve cases of sickness aboard the
captured liner. None was reported
serious. Inconvenience rather than
hardship was the principal suffering
The Monday night Zeppelin raid
was not entirely unexpected. All the
newspapefrs predicted another air in
vasion, following the visits to English
east coast towns by German aero
planes last week. It was realized that
these flights were for the purpose of
feeling out England's new air defense.
The Times today commenting on
this phase of the recent developments
warned Londoners that a raid on Lon
don by a great number of German air
dreadnoughts probably would bring
serious results.
The Times pointed out that Lon
don's air defenses are in process of
development and by no means perfect.
A Rotterdam dispatch today said
that there was great rejoicing in Ber

eager for another raid on Ixndon.

NORFOLK, Va., Feb. 1.—The Brit

port by a German prize crew early to
day, was captured by a German mer
chant raider, not a submarine, accord

ture, which was as thrilling as any
pirate story, deny the report first re

officials here.
The Appam, they said, was attack

Canary islands by some armed mer
chant vessel whose name could not be
learned and which disappeared after
putting a prize crew aboard the liner.
The German prize crew, in charge of
Lieutenant Oscar Berg, will not tell
the name or nature of the boat with
which they attacked the Appam.
Early in the morning of January 15.
the unknown vessel appeared close at
hand and fired several shots across
the bow of the British liner, passen
gers said. So close were the two
vessels that when tbe stranger finally
stopped the Appam, she was across
tbe tetter's bow.
One of the Appam's life boats was
crushed between the two vessels. Thn

deck and bloody fighting ensued. Sev-

the capture of "Jimmy Naples," her
alleged kidnaper.
She had been missing since Decem

of the passengars In being held closely
to their state rooms. Details were
also lacking on what measures were
taken by the feiw Germans to prevent
mutiny and being overpowered by the
overwhelming crew of the captured
prize.
That the Appam would be interned
as a Gterman prize of war was gen
erally believed. Naval and Interna
tional law would give her a chance to
depart after being provisioned and any
necessary repairs made, but It was re
garded certain that the object of the
Germalns had been attained in bring
ing the Appam to this port, where two
German raiders, the Prlnz Eitel Fried
rich and Kron Prinz Wlihelm, aie now
interned.
Many novel points of International
maritime law were raised by the cir
cumstances of the Appam's capture.
For the first time since the war be
gan and also in the history of all
naval warfare, naval official* declared
the question of disposition of the Brit
ish' passengers and crew was unset
tled.
Instructions from Washington were
asked today by the commandant of the
Norfolk navy yard, the customs col
lector and immigration officials. The
treasury department must deoide
whether an internment order shall be
made and whether the British offlera
and crew shall be interned or relQ&ed.
That an application for internment
of the vessel, as a German priz^ "un
til the war ends, would be made, was
indicated early today by official® Who
boarded the Appam upon her arrival.
If Interned, the German crew will
also be held prisoners for the term of
the war. They will probably be left
aboard the Appam.

prize. Officials here expressed little
doubt on this score.
That the Appam was brougfht clear
across the Atlantic rather than risk
the danger of running into the cordon
of British war vessels between Gi
braltar and the English channel was
the belief.
Safety of the passengers was also
reported today to be one of the con
siderations causing the Appam to
make for Norfolk, the British cruiser
patrol at the entrance to Hampton
Roads having been withdrawn for
many weeks. It was stated that the
Appam's course was several hundred
miles south of the ordinary Atlantic
