ESTABLISHED, IN 1857.
COUNTY'S LOSS 01
CORN S1.350.000
That is the Estimate of Webster City
Business Men—4675 to the
-Farm.
Two Webster City business men
who are interested in the^ corn crop
of Hamilton county, got together the
other day and attempted to figure
out the monetary loss to Hamilton
county resulting from her poor crop
this year. They have probably come
close to the truth with their figures,
although someone may think he has
it figured more nearly correct
Their figuring runs something
like this:
Allowing 90,OOO acres of corn to
Hamilton county and 50 bushels to
the acre in seasons when there are
good crops, the yield would be 4,
fiOO.OOO bushels. This year 20 bush
els to the acre was taken as the basis
rof
an^ average and 20 bushels to the
acre for 90,000 acres gives 1,800,
000 bushels. This many bushels at
a fair price of 50 cents per bushel
would amount to $900,000. If
^good crop season there were 4,500
000 bushels of corn sold at 50 cents
per bushel, the value of this would
'in Hamilton county and an average
loss to each farm for the poor Wn
crop would be $675- Of course the
large farms suffered a greater loss,
and the small farms suffered in pro
portion, but the loss per farm in
this county/ approximates the, above
amount.
In spite of this loss there are few
er unemployed men in the county
44mx' tor..many ~yefcrg.~-Tlmea. are- xe*
ally prosperous, business in ill lines
is fairly good and prospects never
were better. Be the cause what it
may, these things are true.
Advocates of the Federal Reserve
svstem are giving it the credit of
the loosened money situation. Oth
ers who are not so favorable to this
system are giving, the praise to
greater confidence on the part of the
people who are not holding on to
their money so closely.
Chas. G. Dawes, president of the
Central Trust Company of Illinois,
one of the best Informed men of the
west, speaks as follows:
"The wise statesman and the wise
business man in dayB like these,
however, looks ahead for the inevit
able reaction which will occur after
•1916 has passed. The wise business
man generally uses a time of pros
perity, fair prices and ample credit
to get out of debt just as the unwise
use it to get .into debt. In such a
"jtime as that which we confront,
'/debts can be discharged and con
tracted with comparative ease. If
our business men keep their heads
—if rank speculation and the crea
tion of debt fpr speculative enter
prises can be discouraged—in just
that proportion will the time of real
prosperity continue."

the kitten,had recovered from its,

again with the same result. Now if
there is one thing a cat disdains to
lose, it is its footing, equilibrium or
whatever one may call it so the cat
just lost its temper and yowled and

On the E. C. Pilchard farm on the
southern outskirts of the city, there
was some doubt whether or not it
would be safe to let out the- stock.
One hog was released from the barn

The trustees do not wish to make

drayage charges.
The News' idea would be to have
the business men chip in one dollar
each and allow any and all to read
the books, although there are sever
al waVs of making very satisfactory
arrangements.
The books may be kept' in one of
the business houses and patrons will
sign a rcceipt when a book is taken,
which receipt is destroyed upon the
return of the book.
This will give Ellsworth practic
ally eveiV advantage that the larger
cities
enjoy,
so far as a library is
concerned, and the cost yill be vir
tually nothing.
A News representative has talked
the irfatter over with one of the
trustees, and as soon as arrange
ments can be made for a location,
books will be forwarded.
The ^n!y thing asked by the trus
tees is that the books shall be given
reasonably godd care and that the
library shall not be called upon to
pay transportation charges.

and was given in the style usually

standpoint as taken by Rev. Hay

still be so much of a nuisance that

when a telephone wire in the alley
back of the store broke with the
weight of ice which has encrusted all
wires, and fell across an electric
light wire leading into the store.
The current burned out the electric
wire and the woodwork of the win

basket which touched the wire, was
also set on lire and about half of the
latter burned. When Henry Sheldon
arrived early that morning to open
up the store, he found it filled with
smoke and easily located the source.
Tiie moment he opened the door to
the back room he could hear the
crackling of the electric current. All
sorts of things could have happened
had the incident occurred earlier in
the morning, when the blaze could
have gained considerable headway,
