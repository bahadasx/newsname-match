Passenger Ship, Given Up As Lost, Appears in
Hampton Roads In Charge of German Prize
Crew Taken Off Canary Islands By Raider
Which Sank Seven Other Vessels Passeng
ers Are Safe, And Liner Carries Many of Vic
tims' Survivors Perplexing Problem In In
ternational Law Brought Before State Depart
v ment Officials By Appearance of Captured
Ship in Port Here.
Newport News, Feb. 1 With the German naval ensign flut
tering boldly from her stern and in charge of a German prize
crew, the British South African Liner Appam, given up for
lost, took refuge in Hampton Roads this morning with the story
6fseven vesselsxdestroyed by German sea raiders off JLhe Afri
can coast.
The Appam was captured off the Canary Islands on Jan.
15 by a' German raider four days after she had sailed from Dakar,
British West Africa, for Plymouth, Eng.
Whether the captor was a German ,U-boat or a hitherto un
reported German auxiliary cruiser is undetermined. From
what was learned by some of the officials who boarded the Ap
pam it is believed that some steamer armed as a German auxili-
ary raiding shipping off the African coast took the British' liner
and put the prize crew aboard. V
This view is supported by the fact that a submarine could,
hardly have spared a lieutenant and such a large crew to a prize.
Deed Outshines Other Raiders -
Lieutenant Berge, of the German navy, placed on the Ap
pam when she was captured, brought in the prize, "eluding the
cprdonof British cruisers across the Atlantic and adding to the
historic chapter of German exploits at sea a chapter to rank
with the adventures of the Emden, the Prinz Eitel Friedrich and '
Kron Prinz Wilhelm.
There are 451 persons aboard the ship, including 138 sur
vivors of seven, ships sunk by the raider which captured the
Appam; 30 German civilians being transported, from Africa to
England to be placed in. detention camps; 155 members of. tho
Xppam's.crew; 116 original passengers on the Appam and he ...
prize crew of 22. '
v ?f ' . Colonial Officers Prisoners x
Many of the passengers on the Appam are women and chil
dren... There also are several high British colonial officials who
were returning to England from Africa. 1 There also are four
wounded sailors, taken fromone of the sunken ships which re
sisted capture and was shelled. -
;, According to the inf ormation f rom those who talked with
Lieut. Berge, the Appam was captured without any show of re
sistance, on Jan. 15, the day that British news reports said that
wireless communication with the vessel suddenly ceased. A
prize crew was placed on board and the same day the raider
which captured the Appam gave chase to another British
steamer, bound (for Australia, with a cargo of meat. The meat
ship gave battle, was captured and was sunk, after a large por
tion of her, crew had been taken off. . ' . .
V Six more vessels then were destroyed in rapid succession, it
was stated. . The crews were taken on board the Appam, which
ran due west across the Atlantic
Whenthe Appam passed in the "Vir
ginia Capes early today and took on
a pilot, she was asked by the Fort Mon
roe wireless station, who she -wjas. The
reply was, it is stated, that she was

aboard, and after ,his inspection
brought Lieutenant Berge ashore. The
Appam got a clean hill of health.
The four wounded, sailors were the
only cases of sickness found. . .
The German . consul, L. Marshall
on Schilling, took charge of the situa
tion and Lieut. Berge placed himself
under the consul's orders. They went
to the office of Col. Ira Haynes, com
mandant of .Fort Monroe, where the
German officer paid Iris respects and
explained why he had given the wire
less station the name of the German
cruiser ''Buffalo." ... -

WASHINGTON FACES PERPLEXING
PROBLEM IN CAPTURE OF APPAM
Washington, Feu. 1. The first report
to the German embassy came from the
German consul, at Norfolk, who tele
graphed ' that a "German auxiliary
cruiser" had come into port. .
Cuctoms Collector Hamilton, at Nor
folk, reported to the treasury that the
German prize ' steamer which came
Into Hampton Roads this morning has
prisoners of,' war aboard. Hi3 report
was referred at once to tho state de
partment which will- determine the
status of the vessel.
Perplexing questions of international
law may arise from the arrival of the
Appam in Hampton Roads. First, the'
United States must determine whether
the ship simply Is a prize of war or
whether she has been supplied with
an armament' which would give her
the character of an auxiliary . cruiser.
So far as naval authorities here know,
no case exactly like it has arisen to
for Hampton Roads.

The Appam has one 3-inch gun
mounted on her bow but whether it
was on board before her capture or
was mounted by the Germans is not
known. She was brought in under the
German, man-of-war Sag Instead of
the German merShaiyt flag and her
name was given to tHe quarantine offi
cer as "H. M. S. Apam," meaning the
German warship Appam.,
When seen on his way to visit Col.
Haynes, Lieut. B-erg-e fused to talk.
Asked for information -he merely
shook his head and replied:
"Nothing to say, nothing to say."
He is a small man of slight build
with a smkll moustache, and is very
pleasant, " though non-communicative.
A conference with Collector Hamil

afternoon. After a conference be

beginning of the war. The Germn.n
ships Kron Prinz Wilhelm and Prinss

The Hague convention provides:
"A prize may only be brought into a
neutral port on account of unseawor

fuel or provisions. It must leave as
