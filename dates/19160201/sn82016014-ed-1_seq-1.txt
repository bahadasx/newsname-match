The Appam. with 166 passengers

African coast two weeks ago while on
the way to England. She had been

Instead, the big liner was captured
by German sailors, presumably from
one of the kaiser's monster U-boats.
They headed her about through heavy
seas, raced across the Atlantic and

port today, their movements cur

Dress Reform.
THE SPLIT WAIST! SHOCKING!

Four Tenets of Reform Will
Affect AH Ages.
New York, Feb. 1. Extreme fash
ions in women's press will be one of
th most important topics to be con
sidered at the convention of the Gen
eral Federation of Women's Clubs of
America, to be held next May, says
Mrs. William Grant Brown, chairman
of the local board of the federation.
"Ten thousand delegates will take
back to their homes a concrete idea
of dress reform that will be a blessing
to the whole country," said Mrs.
Brown. "We believe in the decollete
gown so far as it is a work of art. but
it should be modest and never sensa
tional. There has grown up a cus
tom of dress for women, especially
young girls, that is sin ply frightful.
The extreme split skirt that shocked
us once has given place to the ex
treme split waif.t. Evening gowns
worn nowadays by women Who prob
ablv mean well but are foolish, are
utterly disgusting, being cut in some
cases almost to the waist line. These
women do i.ot do this to attract at
tention, but because they are possessed
by the idea that to be partly draped
is fashionable.
Against Indecent Extremes.
"Most club women want to estab
lish a general rule against indecent
extremes In evening dress and a cus
tom of making women's gowns con
form to the following four rules:
First, Individuality, every wo
man trying to express her own
ideas.
Second, modesty, not puritan
ism, but a decent regard for what
is proper.
Third, good taste, a degree of
art in the expression of individ
ualism. Fourth, appropriateness. Young
girls should not be dressed like
matrons. Old women should not
dress like girls.
"Many women suggest that if the
present custom of sensational dressing
continues an established ballroom cen
sorship should prohibit women so
gowned from appealing on the floor,
exactly as indecent dancing is forbid
den." -

Larger Cities Filling With Ref

State Prison Farm Swept Away
Rescue 1,168 Convicts.
Little Rock, Feb. 1. Today was one
of watchful waiting in the areas of
eastern Arkansas threatened by the
worst floods in the last 25 years. Res
idents of Cotton Plant, Conway, Wat
son, Lewisville, Pine Bluff, Dumas,
Lake Village and Arkansas City were
casting anxious eyes at the levees
about their cities in the hope they
would withstand the tremendous vol
ume of water against them.
A sudden drop of the temperature
to below freezing lent further distress
last night and today to the sufferers
in sections inundated. Clearing skies
with a high pressure area extending
over all the state indicated a tempor
ary cessation at least of the down
pours that have been steady for almost
a week. Every large city adjacent to
the flood area is filling with refugees
from the smaller and less well protect
ed points.
In the wake of the Arkansas flood
today came cries of distress from
scores of families in the vicinity of
Fort Smith. A committee of business
men of that place was appointed by
Mayor Keid to devise plans of reller.
Clothing, food and medical attention
are needed by many who have sought
refuge in the larger towns.
Convicts Removed.

Chicago, Feb. 1. The fourth day of

SHOWS AJ5IG GAIN
Growth in State Receipts and
Disbursements for January.
Nearly a Million Greater Than
in Any Previous Month.
NEW RECORD IS ESTABLISHED
If Last Month's Showing Be
Maintained All Year
It WrHI Make an Increase of
About $12,000,000.
Continuation of the January record
of receipts and disbursements in the
state treasurer's office, means an in
crease of nearly 12 million dollars in j
the state's business this year, accord-
ing to a report today by Wiley Cook,
assistant state treasurer. Receipts and ,
disbursements in the state treasurer's
office for January showed an Increase
of $957,195. over the corresponding
month last year.
The January showing was a new
financial record for the state. In one
month the state received and dis
bursed a total of $3,157,764.56, as
against a record of $2,200,569.07 in
January, 1915. .
Receipts for January this year were
$1,829,153.23, as against $1,328,605.33
in the same period last year. Dis
bursements by the state increased
from $923,841.83 in January, 1915, to
$1,276,727.24 in January this year. It
was by far the biggest month's busi
ness in the history of the state.
lteeord Never Kqualed.
"The state has never equaled the
record established in the month just
ended," said Cook. "It was an in
crease of nearly a million dollars over
the corresponding month of 1915 and
indicates the rapid growth of the
state's financial business. Records of
former months show nothing to equal
the record for receipts and disburse
ments in January."
Itemized copies of the report have
been sent to Governor Capper, W. E.
Davis, state auditor, and other state
officials. Should the increase started
in the first month of the new year con
tinue, the state treasurer's office will
receive and distribute nearly 12 mil
lion dollars more than was handled
in 1915.
Some of the January financial trans
actions of larger state departments in
cluded: General revenue fund; re

Winter Temperatures Probably
Will Linger Some Days.
Conditions over the state are slight
ly improved with the coming of fair
weather. The entire state is still cov
ered with Ice and snow, although no
precipitation has been reported in the
past thirty-six hours. Railroad, wire
and street car service is better and the
good weather will afford an opportun
ity to repair broken wires and fallen j
poles. Zero temperatures prevailed i
over most of Kansas this morning.
Many calls for aid were received by
charitable associations during the past
week and numerous needy families
were supplied with food and cloth
ing. Stock raisers are prepared as a
result of the previous cold snaps, and
suffering among livestock was prac
tically eliminated
With groundhog day only a day off
the sky has cleared and the sun is
shining bright. This morning dawned
cold, calm and clear, the temperature
standing at 2 degrees below zero and
only a slight wind blowing from the
northwest This is the first fair day
of the week. Prospects are good for
a period of fair weather in the state
at least for the first few days of the
second month. It was expected this
morning that the mercury would go
near 20 degrees today. The snow on
the ground will not melt.
The forecast calls for fair weather
tonight and probably Wednesday with
slowly rising temperature. The wind
is expected to shift toward the south
tonight. "Winter weather will con
i tinue for some time to come," said
S. D. Flora, weather observer, this
j morning, "but it will be much more
, agreeable than the past few days."
The mercury was expected to mount
more rapidly than yesterday. The
high reading yesterday was 12 de
grees. The mercury will be down to about
5 degrees .bove zero tonight, accord
ing to the prediction. The shippers'
I forecast indicates zero temperatures

VICTIMS UNCONSCIOUS
Two Survivors Not Yet Recovered
Enough to Tell of Auto Holdup.
Buffalo, Feb. 1.: The hope that
Miss Grace J. Teiper, one of the in
jured victims of Monday's tragedy on
the Orchard Park road, would revive
to tell of the murder of her mother
and brother was dispelled today when
surgeons reported that she again had
lapsed into a state of coma after brief
periods of semi-consciousness. In one
of these moments a doctor asked her
who struck her and she leplied:
"I don't know."
There were other mumbled words
but whether they gave any clew to the
murderer, doctors and detectives re
fused to say. The condition of John
Teiper. the second survivor of the
traged-. who was under guard of a
deputy sheriff at his home in Orchard
Park last night continued to improve.
District Attorney Wesley C. .Dudley,
reiterated today that Teiper would be
hrnueht to Buffalo as a material wit
ness as soon as doctors consented to
his removal.

state to care for th falling vparrow
and ihe starving lark.
When the recent cold wave came to
Kansas, it meant starving conditions
for millions of birds in thie state. The
two inch coat of ice was a burglar
proof barriei against ieeds and grains
and crumbe for the birds. Then a
three inch snow covered the troat of
ice. Now the birds- are starving.
Warden Tegmeier stated today that
the state had arranged to feed hun
dreds of ducks in the Cheyenne bot-
I torn s, the well known hunting marshes
: of southwestern Kansas. Appeals will
J probably be made to club women and

For five hours Wednesday Topeka
will be in the spotlight of the state
and nation when President Woodrow
Wilson and party stop here in defense
of the administration's program for

Kansas will be represented in Topeka
when the president's party arrive

and repois from all sections of the

fact that President Wilson is to be ac
companied by his bride has aroused
almost frenzied interest among the
women of Kansas, who want to see a
real, sure enough president's wife.
With it all, is a dignity and a serious
ness that Kansas lu - not failed to
appreciate and respect.
President Wilson will give his mes
sage to Kansas, not as a partisan is
sue, but independent and free from
politics. It will be the story of ex
perts as affecting the nation's need in
