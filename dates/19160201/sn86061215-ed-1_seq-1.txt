cently loet by them near Neuville,
army headquartera announced to
lay, but all their attack* have
been beaten off, the Germane atill

Paris, Jan. 81. German forces last
night delivered two attacks with hand
grenades near hill No. 140, both of
which resulted in failure, according to
the French official announcement
given out this afternoon.
While isolated encounters and much
artillery and mining activity is report
ed, comparative quiet seems to have
settled down again on the western
fighting front where the Germans re
cently have reported notable successes.
Athen reiterates reports received
through diplomatic channels that the
Russians are surrounding Erzerum,
having inflicted a fresh defeat on the
Turks. I
In Albania the advance of the Aus
trians continues, but according to re
ports today from German sources.
there is likely to be increased opposi
tion to them in the near future. Italy,
it is declared, has decided to continue
her Albanian campaign and has landed
another infantry division with heavy.
artillery at Avlona, with a view to an
effective defense of southern Albania
as a measure of political necessity.
Vienna claims to have repulsed at
tacks by the Russians on the Bukowina
frontier.
On the other fronts and in the Bal
kans no important changes have oc
curred.
Rioting occurred in Lisbon, Portugal
Saturday night, against the increased
cost of living. Bombs were thrown at
soldiers called out to suppress the
rioters. Troops flred and wounded
many rioters.
ITALY WANT8 ALBANIA.
Berlin, Jan. 81.—Italy has decided to
continue the campaign in Albania, ac
cording to Vienna advioes given out
today by the Overseas News agency,
and is said to hare landed an additional
infantry division and several batteries
of heavy artillery at Avlona.
Italy will not give up Albania, the
news agency says. She considers an.
effective defense of the southern part
of the country as a military and politi
cal necessity. Other reports state that
Italy, lacking sufficient troops of her
own, has asked for help from England
and 'Franc*.

British Paper Says Submarine Rules
Are All Right If U. S. Will
Force Observance.
London, Jan. 31—The Manchester
Guardian in editorial comment on the
negotiations between the United
States and Germany regarding sub
marine warfare says:
"What Germany will do will depend
entirely on what she thinks -America's
next step will be if she refuses. As
for the allies, it will be observed that
they are asked to make concessions
and to send their merchantmen to sea
without guns and rely on German
promises to observe certain rules.
Generally speaking, these rules are in
themselves not unreasonable, if only
there is some guarantee that they
will be kept. Will America supply that
guarantee? If she will we have no
doubt what the answer of the allies
will be."

SECOND ATTACK
BY ZEPPELINS ON
PUBIS IS FAILURE
CITY LIGHTS ARE TURNED OFF
AND CROWDS IN STREETS
WATCH FOR RAIDER.
Paris, Jan. 81.—Several bombs
were dropped by the Zeppelin which
flew over the outskirts of Paris last
night, but they produced no suoh
deadly effect as on the occasion of the
raid of Saturday night The official
press bureau gave out the following
statement this morning:
"A German dirigible set out In the
direction of Paris, where it arrived
soon after 10 p. m. It was bombarded
by our special batteries and attacked
by our aeroplanes. Before returning
northward it dropped a number of
bombs, which, according to the news
received so far, did no damage."
Representatives of the Matin who
visited the scene of the raid say that
no damage was done by the bombs.
Three of them fell on a piece of waste
ground and three others in a field. A
police inspector saw the three which
fell in the field. They were covered
with a cotton like substance which
burst into flame. The inspector char
acterized them as Incendiary bombs.
Raider Turns Back.
Upon the approach of the Zeppelin
the alarm was sounded through the
city and in a short time all lights had
been extinguished and most of the
Inhabitants rushed into the streets to
watch for the appearance of the raid
er. In an hour and a half, firemen's
bugles announced that all danger was
past and the lights were turned on
again. The failure of the Zeppelin to
raid Paris last night, the officials be
lieve, was due to comparatively clear
weather and the big fleev of French
airships in readiness.
The Zeppelin raid on Paris Saturday
night when three and a half tons of
explosives were dropped caused the
death of twenty-four persons and the
Injury of twenty-seven.
Censors Are Active.
The Matin says that it has received
Information from ,the postmaster of
one of the places over which the Zep
pelin passed that a number of bombs
were dropped together. The inference
is drawn that the Germans, seeing
themselves threatened by French
aeroplanes, decided to loose all their
bombs at once.
The censors permitted foreign cor
respondents to' telegraph whatever de
tails they could obtain bnt the Paris
morning papers have many blank
spaces.
Reprisals Demanded.
The press is unanimous in demand*
ing reprisals for the two Zeppelin
raldB
on Paris, and also calls for greater
efficiency in the aerial defenses of the
city.
"It is not enough to be indignant at
such tactics." says the Matin. "Public
sentiment expects something else. It
demands reprisals, Immediate and ex
emplary reprisals.
"The people of Paris will preserve
their calm but will hot spare any per
sons who may have been guilty," says
the Journal, "through negligence in
capacity or lack of foresight in not em
ploying that mastery of the air over
the enemy which the people had been
led to believe France possesses."
Alfred Capas, the dramatist, says in
the Figaro:
"Paris Is entitled to a striking
revenge in the near future. One can
not doubt our air service is able to
exact It."
MISSING SAILORS

Liverpool, Jan. 81.—The seven miss
ing seamen from the American line
steamship Philadelphia were landed

Arkansas, Mississippi and
^Ohio Valleys Carrying
Off Most of Water
Washington, D. C., Jan. 31.—Seri
ous floods threaten the lower Ohio
valley, the Mississippi valley from
Cairo, 111., to the Gulf of Mexico and
the valleys of Arkansas because of
the h'iavy rains of Sunday and last
night In Arkansas, the lower Ohio
valley and the Mississippi valley from
St Louis to Vicksburg. The weather
bureau today issued -this special flood
bulletin:
"The heavy rains of Sunday in Ar
kansas, the lower Ohio valley and the
Mississippi valley, from St Louis to
Vicksburg, have continued throughout
the last twelve hours and coming up
on rivers aleardy in flood, have vre
ated a serious situation in the river
valleys of Arkansas and also along the
lower Ohio valley and the Mississippi
valley from Cairo to the gulf. Stages
Monday morning were: St. Louis,
81.2 feet, flood stage, SO feet Cairo,
51.4 feet, flood stage, 45 feet Mem
phis, 89.8 feet, flood stage, 85 feet
Vicksburg, 50.1 feet, flood stage, 45
feet New Orleans, 17.8 feet, flood
stage, 18 feet.
"While warnings have been distrib
uted locally to the points involved, it
now seems probable that by reason
of the continued rains, the stages al
ready forecast will be slightly exceed
ed and that high stages in the Missis
sippi from Cairo to the gulf will be
continued."
FOUR STATES THREATENED^
Kansas City, Mo., Jan. 81.—Four
states of the southwest today faced
heavy property loss and interruption
of traffic, due to the continued rain
which has produced threatening rises
in many streams.
The most serious situation was In
eastern Arkansas from Newport south
to Watson, where the White and
Arkansas rivers empty into the Missis
sippi. Missouri rivers were approach
ing the flood stage, while in eastern
Kansas and northeastern Oklahoma
the rising streams, rain and sleet have
demoralised telephone and telegraph
service and crippled railroad sched
ules.
The Aifcansas at Ft. Smith, near the
Oklahoma border, was more than ten
feet above flood stage last night with
a prospect of another eighteen inch
rise. Many persons have been rescued
from their marooned homes in that
vicinity.
In eastern Arkansas, hundreds of
persons already have fled from their
homes. Fear that the Newport levees
would not hold caused the women and
children of that town to continue to
day to seek places of less danger.
Preparations were made to dynamite
the Newport reservoir lake in an effort
to divert the expected flood around the
town.

IS LOST AT SEA
Washington, D. C., Jan. 31.—The
whereabouts of submarine K-5 remains
unknown to navy officials here today.
The officials, however, were not alarm
ed by the absence of any report from
the submarine. They believe she may
have experienced trouble with' her en-,
gines, but said her battery powe^ was
sufficient to keep her under control in
that case. Failure to receive any re
port from the vessel, they said, might
Indicate that her wireless apparatus
had become deranged.
The possibility that the K-5 might
have been run down by a steamer or
schooner in the fog was discussed
among officials, who thought such a
collision would have been reported be
fore this by the larger vessel.
Secretary Daniels ordered the' des
troyers Sterrett and Perkins, enroute
from Pensacola to Charleston, to
search for the missing submarine. The
destroyer Worden at Charleston, the
coast guard cutters Seminole and
Yamacraw and the buoy tender Man
grove also are searching for her.
All boats of the class, officials
said, have thoroughly demonstrated
themselves to be seaworthy and ef
ficient. Those on the Atlantic coast
went to Key West from New York
without difficulty last winter for man
euvers and were making the same trip
when the K-6 disappeared Sunday.
The boats in the Pacific recently
went from San Francisco to Honolulu
under their own power, establishing
a new record for long distance cruis
ing for American s^bmwinea.

REBEL FORCE8 CONTINUE TO
GAIN VICTORIES OVER THE
GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS.
Peking, Jan. 81.—The province of
Kwei Chow is in full rebellion. The
governor was forced to flee on Jan. 16,
and communications have been inter
rupted. It is reported that Lu Chow
and Tze Liut Zing have been captured
by the revolutionists.
The American gunboat Monacacy is
at Cung Kin on the Yanktze Kiang,
about ninety miles to the northeast of
Lu Chow. The commander has noti
fied Dr. Paul S. Relnch, the American
minister to China, that all is quiet in
the neighborhood and that a zone has
been outlined within which the Amer
ican gunboat will protect foreigners
who are threatened.
Twelve thousand soldiers from the
province of Kwei Chow are reported
to be marching, in company with Yun
naneze revolutionists, upon Chung
Kin, where fighting is expected to take
place within a few weeks.
The inception of the revolutionary
movement in China, which was first
manifested on the Chinese cruiser
Chao-Ho at Shanghai in the beginning
of last December and which assumed
more serious proportions when the
revolutionists in the province of Yun
nan announced the formation of a
separate republic, was attributed to
dissatisfaction with the. purpose of
President Yuan Shi Kal to restore a
monarchial form of government.
The revolution has been reported as
spreading over into the provinces im
mediately to the north and east of
Yunnaii. The president of the Chinese
Republic association announced on
December 20, from San Francisco that
the prdvinces of Sze-Chuen, Kwei
Chow, Kwang Tung and Kiangsl would
join in the revolt against the rule of
Yuan Shi Kal.

ed that the revolutionists had been
victorious in a fight with the govern
ment forces at Suifu, in the province
of Sse-Chuen.
Litters from toe milliarr gosMkor

tionary regime in Yunnan, addressed
on January 24 to the foreign legations
at Peking, promised protection for all
foreigners in the districts under con
trol of the revolutionists.

MEMBERS OF CREW
ESCAPE, UNINJURED
Cars Leave the Rails But
Remain Upright Passing
Freight Is Stopped
Burlington fast mall train No. 8,
due here about 12:30 a. m., met with
a serious accident early Sunday morn
ing when passing through Dudley,
some twelve miles west of Ottumwa.
As a result the entire train was de
railed, the engine and tender sepa
rated, a passing freight train stalled,
the north main line track blocked for
several hours and the south track torn
iip a great distance. Despite the gen
eral tearup of rolling stock and track,
none of the train or engine crews,
baggagemen or mall clerks were hurt
beyond a jolting. Fast mall train No.
15, west bound, was delayed about
three and a half hours by the acci
dent. No. 12, due here later than No.
8, owing to the latter being about two
hours behind schedule, came in ahead
of the fast mail and suffered no delay
by the wreck. Wrecking crews and
track men were dispatched to Dudley
within a short time after the derail
ment and many of the local officials
were soon on the scene to direct the
work of clearing the road. The north
main line was easily made ready for
traffic and comparatively little delay
was suffered, but the south track has
to be rebuilt and section men are
working on it today.
The cause of the trouble Is believ
ed to have been a defective tank
truck on engine No 2817 pulling the
fajit mall. The scene of the accident
waq ,niur. the crossover at Dudley and
the mail train quite late is said to
have been goitig flfty-flve miles per
hour, striving to maker up some of
the lost time. When th\i crash came
the engine proper broke from the
tender which,- with the mail cars, im
mediately left the track. Wreckage
flying from, the tender is supposed to
have struck and broken the air hose
on extra freight train No. 5026 In
charge of Conductor L. Shaw and stop
ped the extra which waB west bound.
Two of the mail cars fell over against
the freight train and were somewhat
scratched the balance with the en
gine tender left the track on the
south side and the tank was smashed.
The cars did not turn over. The fast
mall engine, In charge of Engineer
Lew Ashway and Fireman Chrlsten
son, ran about ,800 feet before stop
ping. Conductor J. J. Knowles was
in charge of the mall train and stated
that the stop was almost normal, he
being seated In his chair was unaware
of the gravity of the accident until he
got out of the train.
Fireman Chrlstenson is congratulat
ing himself upon having fixed his flre
before reaching the station and step
ping into the cab before the break
came. His presence In the gangway
throwing in a flre when the engine
struck the crossover would have spel
led disaster to him. That none of the
various crews were hurt is considered
little short of a miracle.
GREAT COAL VEIN
Lansford, Pa., Jan. 31.—The famous
mine fire which has been raging for
more than sixty years and which start
ed at Summit hill, near the spot
where Phillip Glnter discovered an
thracite coal in 1791, has burned
through the immense concrete wall
which the Lehigh Coal and Navigation
Co. sank in front of it, several years
ago, at a cost of more than a million
dollars. It is now threatening the mam
moth vein in the Panther creek val
ley, the largest and richest vein of an
thracite in the world.
The wall, which was sunk to a depth
of 100 feet, was fifteen feet thick. The
fact that the flames have eaten
through this huge barrier has caused
grave fears among the Lehigh Coal
and Navigation officials, who are put
ting forth every posible effort to pre
vent the flre from getting into the vast
beds of anthracite In the vicinity.
A large force of men is drilling holes
deep into the earth, and into which,
water and slush is being poured in the
hope of preventing a rapid spread and,
if possible, to extinguish the flre.

EXPONENTS OF
PRESIDENT DENIES THAT MEN
WHO WILL PROFIT ARE DlC
TATING POLICY.
Milwaukee, Wis., Jan. 81. Presi
dent Wilson threw down the gauntlet
today to opponents of national pre
paredness who have declared that the
movement sprang from the desires of
munitions and armament manufactur
ers to make money.
"There are some things that are be
ing said that I hope you will not be
lieve," the president declared. "It is
being said that this agitation tor prep
aration for national defense comes
chiefly from those who are Interested
In supplying the government with the
munitions of war and from those who
are interested in supplying armament
"Gentlemen, do not allow yourselves
td be misled by statements of that
sort Anything that the government
does somebody Is going to make
money out of but the impulse for this
thing does not come from those quar
ters. The impulse comes from men dls
Interested, men who know the actual
circumstances of the country, and
who know that these things are im
mediately necessary."
The president's declaratlQn was de
livered from the rear platform of his
private car at Racine, Wis., half an
hour before he reached this city,
Before he began speaking, the presi
dent stood bareheaded, silently smiting
down at the crowd. Mrs. Wilson step
ped out beBlde him.
"Here is some one, ladjies and
gentlemen," he said, "much better
worth looking at than I am."
The crowd applauded and Mrs. Wil
son smiled broadly.
The president came here to speak
for national preparedness at the audi
torium at 2:80 p. m. today. Tonight he
will address another meeting in Chi*
I cago.
Salute Is Fired.
The thundering of a national salute
by a cannon greeted the president as
he stepped from Ms private car after
receiving members of the reception
committee. A crowd of more than 15,
000 persons was packed just outtdde of
the station and thousands more lined
the route to the hotel. It was the
largest number to welcome the presi
dent during his present trip.
The crowd was lield back by Infan
trymen with fixed bayonets, and a
troop of cavalry escorted the president
during the short ride from the station
to the hotel. Elaborate arrangements
were made for guarding him during the
ride to the hall from the hotel.
GOES THROUGH CHICAGO.
Chicago, Jan. 31.—President Wilson
spent an hour and a half In Chicago
today en route to Milwaukee, where
the Bpeaks this afternoon.
The train bearing the president's
party arrived at the LaSalle street
.station shortly after 8 o'clock and
was switched through freight yards
I to the Northwestern terminal, where
'the president remained until his spe
cial departed at 10 a. m.
At the Northwestern station the
president and Mrs. Wilson posed for
photographers and took a short walk
on the plaitform.
At both stations crowds numbering
several thousands stood outside the
gates and clamoring for a sight of
the executive. President Wilson ap
peared on the observation platform
and lifted his hat to the crowd but
Mrs. Wilson remained Inside the car.
While the president was standing
on the rear platform shortly before
the departure of the train, a sharp ex
plosion was heard. Secret service
men crowded to the platform and the
president, apparently somewhat start
led, entered the car.
A cloud of escaping steam showed
that the connecting hose between the
rear coach and the one next forward
had burst. The president soon emerg
ed, and stepping to the platform,
walked to where the break was being
repaired.
The incident created little excite
ment among the crowd, most of those
In the station being unaware of the
happening.
Rests at Cleveland.
The president started on the last
stage of his tour refreshed by a day's
rest yesterday In Cleveland. His spe
cial left Cleveland at midnight and
was due to arrive In Milwaukee at
noon today. The president and Mrs.
Wilson expected to hold a brief infor
mal reception at the hotel and to
lunch in their suite.
The trip from Chicago to Milwau
kee was to be broken by the first of
several brief addresses by the presi
dent from the rear platform of his pri
vate car. Three such addresses were
on the program: At Waukegan, 111.,
10:50 6'clock at Kenosha, Wis., 11
o'clock, and at Racine, Wis., 11:25
o'clock. At none of these places, It
was thought, would the president de
liver more than a.flv6 minute ad
dress.
During the ride from Chicago to
Waukegan the president devoted
much time to correspondence and pre
paring material for his Milwaukee ad
dress. Because of the large foreign
born population of the city, It was
thought he would touch on the duties
of naturalized Americans in their
adopted country in connection with
the preparedness policy. W'
