UPBYHANEV
E. I. Olsen Speaks on Ob
noxious Weeds and the
Damage They Do.
ATTENDANCE IS
VERY GOOD TODAY
Despite Unfavorable Condi
tions Many Come to
Town.
Weed eradication, a problem which
confronts North Dakota farmers year
In and year out, was the subject for
discussion at the morning- session of
the Corn and Olover convention and
Mid-Winter fair today, and part of
the afternoon meeting: will be devot
ed to it. Edgar I. Olsen, field agent
for the Grand Forks County Better
Farming association, discussed .the
subject this morning, and he will di
rect an open meeting on it during
the latter part of the afternoon ses
sion.
J. G. Haney, of the experimental
farm of the International Harvester
company, spoke on "Crop Rotation"
at the opening of the afternoon ses
sion.
The session this morning was very
well attended considering the weath
er conditions. Many farmers found It
difficult getting here, but they start
ed early and got here in plenty of
time for the session.
Judging Under Way.
The first of the judging was done
this morning, the corn, potato and
sheaf grain awards being completed.
The corn and grains were judged by
.T. G. Haney, and P. C. Clements of
Moorhead, county agent for Clay
county, judged the potatoes. The
small grain awards will be made this
afternoon.
There will be no evening session,
unless plans are.changed late this af
ternoon.
Fully Explains Work.
In his address this morning, Mr.
Olsen explained fully the methods of
eradicating weeds, following which
some of the farmers present re
counted personal experiences. Weeds
cost' the United States $301,000,000
every year, he declared, and the state
of North Dakota $50,000,000. They
cut down the yield, damage the crops,
cheapen the products, mean hard
work, injure the stock, reduce the
profits, rob the soil and lower land
values. He told how the weed adapts
itself to the soil, climate and sur
roundings, and how it spreads easily
by seeding profusely and is distri
buted readily by long-lived seed and
by underground stems and roots. They
cut down the yield, he said, by rob
bing the crop of room, light and food
moisture and by harboring insects
and fungus diseases.
Weed seeds are spread by impure
seed, by wind, water, and anow and
by animals, birds and man. They are
distributed by tools and machinery,
by railroads and in packing boxes.
To get rid of quack grass, an im
portant problem to state farmers, the
farmers must trench plow in the fall,
disk early in the spring and keep on
disking, seed thoroughly to sorghum
or millet, cut and remove the crop
and fall plow.
Mr. Olsen offered the following as
weed remedies: rotate crops, fan and
screen the seed, cultivate frequently
and thoroughly, prevent seeding, use
smother crop, pasture with sheep and
enrich the ground.
Evening Session.
At last night's session, silos and si
lage was thoroughly discussed. It
was pointed out that the main point
in building silos was to have one that
would not freeze during the winter,
and W. R, Porter of the extension de
partment of the agricultural college
told of the success of concrete silos,
illustrating his lecture with motion
pictures. Concrete silos which had
withstood fire and cyclone and the
elements in general were shown. The
pit silo, such as constructed at the In
ternational Harvester company's farm
near the university, also was discuss
ed, and many views illustrating it
were shown. This silo has been par
ticularly successful in keeping out
cold.
P. C. Clements discussed potatoes
at yesterday afternoon's meeting. He
emphasized the importance of limiting
the varieties grown in the state and
of finding more satisfactory and ef
fective methods of marketing crops.
Potato warehouses, where the crop
can be stored until the farmer wants
to sell, are excellent things, he said.
The farmer, however, should grow po
tatoes on a large scale and the com
munity should erect such a warehouse.
If this is done, greater results will be
attained. A competitive market
should be established, and the form
ers should handle their crops through
commission agents, in much the same
way as fruit growers of the west do.
Mr. Clements declared that there
are too many varieties to get the best
prices and attain the best crop results.
A very few varieties, adaptable to
North Dakota, are better.
Mr. Haney also spoke briefly on po
tato marketing. He told of one farm
er in Wisconsin who sorted his pota
toes as a fruit grower, does his fruit,
taking out the bad and then wrapping
tlie good potatoes in paper. 'These
potatoes brought $2 In the Mlttneap
oils market, he declared.

REPORT THAT ENGLAND
WILL ABANDON ALUES
OFFICIALLY DENIED
London, Feb. 1.—Official denial
la made here of reports, attribut
ed to German sources, that Ens
land intends to abandon her
Allies, and has made peace over
tures to Germany. The statement
follows:
"The German chancellor has
stated that England is compelling
the Allies to refrain from ejiter
ing upon any peace movements.
This statement, which our Allies
know to be untrue, was made tor
the purpose of injuring England
in the eyes of neutrals. To our
Allies, on the other hand, we hear
that insidious and untrue reports
are being circulated from German
sources, that England intends to
abandon them and has even made
peace overtures to Germany,
which have been refused. Tlie
two statements together arc a
good illustration of how un
scrupulous German methods arc."

ATTITUDE STILL
IS UNCERTAIN
Question of what Claim will
be Made in Behalf pf
German Viewpoint.
Washington, Feb. 1.—Perplexing
questions of international law may
arise in the Appam case.
First, the United States must deter
mine whether the ship is simply a
prize of war, or whether she had
been supplied with armament which
would give her the character of an
auxiliary cruiser so far as naval au
thorities here know, no case exactly
like it has arisen to concern the
United States since the beginning of
the war.
The German ships Kron Prinz Wil
helm and Prinz Eitel Friederich,
which took refuge in Hampton Roads
early in the war, uuxiliary cruisers,
are now interned as such. The Hague
convention provides:
Disposition of Prize.
"A prize may only be brought into
a neutral port on account of unsea
worthiness, stress of weather, or want
of fuel or provisions. It must leave
as soon as the circumstances which
justify its entry are at an end.
"If it does not, the neutral power
must order it to leave at once should
it fail to obey, the neutral power must
employ the means at its disposal to
release it with its officers and crew,
and to intern the prize crew."
In case the Appam can be consid
ered as an auxiliary cruiser, she is
entitled, under international law, to
a certain length of time to make
necessary repairs, load enough coal
and provisions to carry her to the
nearest home port. In any event,
officials here regard it as a foregone
conclusion that the Appam will re
main in Hampton Roads until the end
of the war.
British cruisers patrolling Atlantic
lanes of commerce, probably already
advised by wireless of the Appam,
will be steaming for the Virginia
Capea^to guard the entrance outside
the tnree-mile limit.
As a merchant ship she could re
main voluntarily in port, the only
question for the United States to de
termine being the disposition of the
German prize crew and prisoners of
war. which the ship carries.
