Till: LAST BUFFALO
HUM1 OF THK PAWNEES.
Writing In tho State Journal, S. C.
Bassott, of Gibbon says:
Settlors in the Platto valley in IS!!
readily recall the hunting trip of tho
Pawnees as they viewed the procoo
sion passing up the Platto valley In
July, 1S73. The procession was quit
a mile in length: First came th'i men
hunters mounted on ponies and an
Indian never appeared graceful on
horseback armed wit h bows and ar
rows and a few guns; following these
was a long string of ponies in charge
of women, to each pony fastened two
long poles, one end of which dragged
on the ground; tied to tho poles was
the camp cquippage of tho Indians; in
the rear was a considerable herd of
loose ponies, horded and driven by
the children of ,the party. While 11 ap
peared as a motley procession, lackirg
in any orderly arrangement, yet U was
wonderfully animating as all the In
dians, some 700 in number, seemed so
pleased, excited, delighted at tlie pros
pect of a hunt for buffalo.
A happy, contented, peaceful peo
ple. For soce weeks they huti.eJ the
buffalo on the plains of southwest Ne
braska, and had cured for winter use
thousands of pounds of buffalo meat a3
well as tho hides of these animals,
when on August 5, while hunting on
the Frenchman, the Pawnees wore at
tacked by tho Sioux, some 1,200 war
riors, and in the battle wheh ensued
the Pawnees lost of men, women and
children, 15C; also all of their dried
meat and most of their ponies. The
Pawnees were taken to Plum Creek
(now Lexington), loaded on box cars
and transported to Silver Creek and
thence on foot to their ro3Jrvut1on
mar Genoa. The appearance of the
I'nited States troops put an end to tho
battle on the Frenchman. The loss of
tne Sioux is given as fifty.

Wheat Sells for $1.1(1.
Wheat Bold in the local market' at
?1U0 Saturday, but In Omaha that day
tho price weakened and sold for three
cen'ts less than on the preceding day.
Among those who sold Saturday was
Barney Guyman, who contracted to
deliver 1,000 bushels at $1.10. Tills
represents nbout half of his crop. The
Coates Co. shipped out six cars last
week, and would have shipped out
more if cars could have been secured.
In order to make the shipments they
did, ;the Coates Co. burlaped the box
cars in which coal had been shipped.
By reason of the scarcity of cars, prac
tically evory elevator in Nebraska is
full of wheat, and In Omnha there are
2,000,000 bushels that are held solely
because cars connot be obtained. It
Is believed that if the elevator stocks
are not relieved soon tho price of
wheat will take a downward shoot.
Message of a Banknote.
Writing on a banknote once freed
an English slave. The note camo into
the hands of a Liverpool merchant's
cashier. He examined it, noticed some
red marks on the back and by tho' lav
ish use of time and ingenuity deci
phered the message. It ran: "If this
nolo should fall into the hands of John
Dean of Longhlll, near Carlisle, he
will learn thereby that his brother is
languishing a prisoner in Algiers."
John Dean was found, and he applied
to the government and interested the
prime minister, who stirred the for
eign secretary Into action. Inquiries
wero made, and the dey, by golden ar
guments, was persuaded to release him.
For eleven years he had been a galley
slave, and ho luul written the message

A real estate llrm that Is rental
agents for a hundred or more hoii3(?a
in town, says that he does not re
member a time when so many houses
in North Platto wero vacant, lie ea
tmates tho number nt fifty. While
many of those aro on tho slinck nature
there aro a number of desirable houses
vacant. Rents hnvo decreased in mar.v
instances twenty por cent. This con
dition Is duo to the fact that during
tho past two or three years the num
ber of houses built has boon grentcr
than our growtli in population. It Is
also truo that the percentage of homo
owners is increasing each year; the
men who rented a few years ago new
own the houses in which they live.
