CONCERNING SAD
DEATH OF SNOW
I SLIDE VICTIMS
I Young Men Found Under Four Feet
I of Heavy Snow. Probably Died
I From Suffocation
I Hydo Park, Jan 30. In Hydo Purl;
I today thcro Is great sorrow and
I mourning n account o two of our
flno young mon having been sudden
I ly and without warning taken from
our midst and called home to meet
their Maker. Thero aro somo lnac
I, curacies concerning tho mattor as
' published in tho Desoret News. Tho
I young man Marvin Dalnes aged 21,
I son of Joseph B. Dalnes, and Appy
I Woolf, aged 29, son of Isaac Woolf,
had been working about thrco miles
I east of Hydo Park In a mlno. About
H a week ago they ceased work as tho
H snow becamo vory deep and was al
H - so dangerous. They had been camp
I lng In a tent at tho mouth of Bogus
I Knock's canyon, and in a placo where
I it was thought thero was no danger
H at all. On Thursday January 27, tho
I two young men with Dolmar Dalnes,
I started up to tho tent with a team
to bring down their bedding nnd oth
I cr things. Tho snow was so deep
I tliat thoy could not roach tho tent
I with tho team. Mervin and Appy told
H Delmar ho could go back homo and
H they would go on up nnd probably
H stay all night and como down in the
H morning bringing what things thoy
BJ could. Thero being a stovo, food,
H and coal thero, they thought, of
Hj courso they would bo all right
HJ Tho night was a fearful ono, ns
J also was tho next forenoon. An the
Hj boys had not returned by noon, Mr.
HJ Joseph B. Dalnes became alarmed,
H and with his son Dolmar, mounted
m horses and went up tho canyon. As
' ,M they neared tho tent thoy were hor-
jjf rifled 'to1 find rinow slide had come
down the hillside1 and had" partly
H burled the tent. Tho south end tent
H pole and south part of tho tent was
H (till standing. Tho north sldo or tho
H tent was down and tho bed hetnc
H east and west was covered with
H about four feet of hard packed snow.
H Mr. Dalnes and his eon hurriedly
H shoveled enough snow away to find
H tho bodies, and to assure themselves
H that tho boys were dead. They thou
H' hastened homo with tho sad "rtiws.
H In probably less than an hour aft-
H er tholr return, thlrty-nlno men and
H boys horseback arid with four span
HJ of horses on two sleighs, wero on
H their way to tho hills. After some
H hard digging thoy found tho bodlos
H lvlng each on tholr left Bldo, cold in
H death. Tho tent was nrossed hcav-
H Uy upon tholr faces by tho weight
H of tho snow and thoy doubtless died
H from suffocation. About 9:30 o'clock
H nt night tho bodies wero brought in
H to town. Thero was not a hono bro.
ken and tho bodies wero only light
II ly discolored,
H There will bo a double funeral hold
tomorrow at 1 p. m. Tho sympathy
H of tho wholo community goes out to
tho bereaved parents, and tho young
wlfo of Mr. Woolf, who la loft with
H a young son, ono year old.
Mr. Joseph Dalnes has surely seen
H much sorrow tho last few years. He
H has burled two wives and suffered
months from lung trouble, contract-
oil whilo on a mission In England.

CRIMSON LADS
TAKE GAME FROM
RIGBY HIGH
Tho storms provented tho baskot
ball team from tho Brlghara Young
College from taking its trip to Salt
Lako City and plaing the University
of Utah team. It was aftr four
o'clock before any opening was
mudo. This would havo brought the
boys in Salt Lako too lato for tho
gamo. A gamo with tho Rlgby High
School was therefore arranged for
Saturday night. In this gamo tho B.
Y. team was victorious, carrying n
scoro of 58 to 30, in their favor.
Tho Rlgby team put up a plucky
fight for young players. Their coach
Mr. Steed, an old basketball player
and a shark at making foul pitches,
plaed with tho Idaho team. In tho
last half of the gamo Coach Jenson
put In the subs, Berntscn and Neol
ey, in p'neo of Nielsen and Cox,
Tho attendance nt tho gamo was
small and tho enthusiasm at a low
obb. This may probably bo duo to
tho fact that many of tho students
knew nothing of the gamn, which
was not arranged until after school
dismissed on Friday, and also many
of tho influential students wero en
gaged in other and previously ar
ranged activities.
MR. SHRIVES
LEAVES FOR
PARIS, IDAHO
Has Gone to Supply Food For Deer
Which Are Reported to Be
' Snow Bound
Frank Shrives of Franklin, gamo
warden for Franklin, Bear Lako and
Oneida Counties, was In Logan yes
terday on his way to Paris, Idaho,'
whero ho has been called to invest
Igato tho deer situation. Ho has
been informed that a largo herd of
deer near-sParls-wlll either havo to
bu fed or thoy will "perhaps starve,
Mr. Shrives will mako arrangementss
for tholr feeding.
Iu speaking of tho gamo laws for
Utah and Idaho, tho visitor feels that
thoro should bo a uniformity of laws
between Utah and Idaho on matter
of gamo protection. Ho Is of tho
opinion that tho open season for
shooting deer, sago hens and ducks,
also for fishing, should bo tho samo.
In this way thero could bo a cooper
ation between tho wardens of tho
counties adjoining the state lino, In
seeing that tho proper respect for
tho laws of tho respective states, aro
Riven.

MAYOR OF
WELLSVILLE
MAKES REPLY
In tho Journal dated January 29,
an artlclo appeared slgnod "Citizen,"
wheroln the party proccods to glvo
udvlco Jo tho residents and taxpayers
of ouj city relativo to tho sale of
Its electric transmission and distrib
uting iiystom. Wo may not bo as
wlso as tho party giving tho advice,
but at this writing tho court hns not
deemed it necessary to appoint a
guardian to handle tho affairs of our
municipality. Whllo I think it
would havo) been advisable to havo
dono so if wo had continued to hold
tho property and fondlo tho too often
cherished delusion Munlolpal Ownor
Milp, when in reality it is a losing
financial proposition, lnefllclont in Its
tervico, and Inadequate to tho wants
and requirements of tho pcoplo that
It serves.
Why did wo sell our electric trans
mission and distributing system?
1. Because It would not pay tho In
terest on tho investment.
2. Becauso tho maintenance and
depreciation was a great burden.
3. Becauso it was nocessary to tax
tho peoplo for tho nccossany sinking
funds In order to bo prepdrod to ro
deem tho bonds when duo,
4. Becauso our lack of Jroowledga
to handlo an enterprlso that which
requires special training.
E. Because wo can rcdeom our
bonds, and rellove our peoplo of this
burden',, buy our electricity at a
cheaper xto, toIIoyo ourselves of
tho probability and responsibility of
personal injury damages.
Last,, but not least, after a full
discussion by tho taxpayers of our
municipality as far as I havo been
able to learn aro anxious that tho
salo ho mado. It Is neither a schemo
of Domocrnts or Republicans, but an
action of citizens Interested In mu
nicipal growth.
As to tho. municipal electric light
conditions in Logan and Hyrum aro
concerned, I havo nothing to say, tho
problem bolongs to them. Wo aro
perfectly satlsflod with tho action
taken and need no further advlco
from tho party signed "Cltlzon."
