COUNTY JUDGE CHAMPION IN
TRODUCES INNOVATION WH.CH
WILL REVOLUTIONIZE CERE
MONIES IN ARDMORE.
"Do you promise to take this wom
an, whom you hold by the rig;!)!, hind,
to be your lawful wedded vif, to
love, cherish, protect, and provide for
her so long as life shall last, and
that you ful.tIl(r proniise to take out
a life insurance policy in her favor
in the amount of one thousand dol
lars, to further protect her in the
event of your early demise?"
The above is the text of a marriage
I fiorntiinnv tvliIMi n'da fn t rrwlimnil ll-
ltil? ,:'i:e
jit I I wi in nig a nun i int pt-i.inr in 1110
chambers one day last week, and
when the startled groom awoke from
his trance he immediately went out
and made good with one of the best
old line companies in existence.
"That is not a bad stunt at all,"
said the urbane judge, "and I believe
I will have Kelly Brown introduce a
bill in the legislature making it man
datory upon every newly married man
to take out a policy, unless he is al
ready well insured."
"When you come to look at it,"
said Mrs. Curtis, probation officer,
"it is a good plan. Too many young
men marry nowadays without ever
thinking of providing for their fami
lies in the event of their early death,
and while the matter was tried out
more in the nature of a joke than
j otherwise, Judge Champion is entitled
:to some credit for being a sensible
joker. I hope to see it adopted all
over the state."
Unconsciously our astute county
judge lias made a hit with the female
portion of our citizenship, and no
doubt when the lights are burning in
;the parlors Sunday nights and the
j little answer is asked for, there will
' be a cross-examination as to the
j amount of life insurance the applicant
. carries before permanent arrange-
ments are perfected.

"Sergius Sazanoff, the Russinn min
ister of fore'gn affairs, today received
a deputation of journalists to whom
he gave a general review of the Bal
kan situation. Hls most interesting
remarks concerned Roumania, whose
relations with Russia, he paid, re
main perfectly satisfactory and am
icable, lie admitted that some time
ago the attitude of Roumania was un
certain, owing to her fear of hostile
acts on the part, of the central pow
ers, but that, he was now convinced
that Roumania would not fall into a
German trap.
"I repeat that the Atistro-Gcr-mnns
persist in their Roumarjan
campaign, but it is not producing the
effect desired on practical Rouman
ians,' said M Sazanoff. He added
that the whole Balkan situation would
find its solution only after the war
had ended.
"M. Sazanoff declared that German
attempts to secure a separate peace
with Russia had recently been re
newed. "We left them all unanswer
ed and took no notice of them." he
said.

WILL BE INTRODUCED AT THE
REGULAR MEETING OF BOARD
OF CITY COMMISSIONERS TO
NIGHT. At the regular meeting of the Hoard
of City Commissioners tonight, a reso
lution will be introduced authorizing
the mayor to call n special election
for the purpose of giving the quali
fied voters of the city an opportunity
of voikig on the question of issuing
bonds for street and alley purposes.
As previously stated, the street and
alley fund of the city is exhausted,
and unless some means are devised
no work on the streets can be done
for the balance of the fiscal year.
The mayor is of the opinion that
the bonds will be voted with little
opposition, while, on the other hand,
several large property owners of the
city are preparing to wage war on
the further Issuance of bonds. One
fact is certain: Unless some means
are devised to supply the street de
partment with cash, Vork will be sus
pended and the streets neglected. In
fact, the entire crew of the street
department was laid off this morning,
pending a settlement of the affair.
