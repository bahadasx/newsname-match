Special to The Heald and News.
Columbia, Jan. 31.?The legislative
session of 1916 is about half over.
Very little of statewide importance has
L been done so far. What the remaining j
" -*- ? ??1? v.n coecinTi will hrin? i

forth is problematical. The fight has!
begun in the senate on the state tax I
commission. Several drastic prohibition
measures are well on their wa3',
but ha-ve not reached final passage.
' The fight on the abuse of free scholark
ships continues, but nothing definite
"has so far been accomplished. All the
elections have been held, however, and
fthe appropriation bill nas been introduced
in the house by the ways and
means committee. The county supply
bill will be introduced this week. So
that the way is clear for trie legislature
to do what it is going to do with
the really important matters before it.
Additional Elections.

Citadel, defeating Col. W. W. Lewis of
York, who for many years has served
as chairman of the board. Mr. J"D?.
P. Thomas of Charleston was re-elected
a member of the board. Messrs. G.
B. White of Chester and C. F. Brooks
of Laurens were elected trustees of
the state negro college", without opposition.
(The general assemoiy is niimg mei
"beards of trustees of the various state
institutions with its own members. The
senate, it will be recalled, voted down
a proposed constitutional amendment
t to allow members of the general asA
sembly to hold the office of trustee of
^ a state college or public or high
school. Why the senate thougnt such
an amendment necessary it is hard to
' in view of the fact that
so many members of the legislature
are already trustees of state institu*tions.
And yet the senator from NewH"berry,
who is already chairman of the
I
"board of trustees of Clemson college,
-voted for it.
The Free Tuition Fight

alent of the amount so provided for
HA free tuition at state institutions. Students
would. by this bill, be allowed to
B expend the aid, extended by the state.
HL^at denominational colleges as well as
ff-jfcit state institutions. No student is to
receive more than $100 in monthjy installments
of $12. The money is to be
had upon notes signed by the student's
rparent or guardian, and is to be returned
after leaving college. Require.
Liente to receive this aid would be
statements by three near neighbors of
the student applying, and an affidavit
from the nearest bank, that the student
is unable to pay. The money is to be
A apportioned equally oeiw^en tne young
A men and the young women of the state.

on the bill introduced by Mr. Sturkie
providing for the sale by the sheriffs,
at whn1fts.ale nrices. to bidders without

the state, of the left over stocks in th?
several county dispensaries.
The bill would require the sheriff of
any such county having such left-over
ctock. within sixty days after the approval
of the act. to dispose of the
Lquor. at wholesale, to parties without
i-ho ?tntp th#a nrip^c; to be aoDroved by

be used in paying expenses.
A letter addressed ro Mr. Williams,
a member of the lie use from Edgefield,
suggesred a solution of this matter
which occasioned considerable amusement.
The letter follows:
"1 s-ee some representatives want to
reopen die dispensary in those counties
wliore they aid not sell out all
their stock. The majority of the people
of Sojith Carolina voted that South
Carolina oe ary auer jtuiuary x auu
to allow a drop of liquor to be sold
legally would be a direct slap in the
face of this majority. You all are not
going to do anything for the" benefit of
the people nohow and I think the best
tiling lo do with the whiskey they have
cn hand is to ship it to Columbia and
let you fellows drink it up. trusting
you may take this view of the matter,
I am your friend, W. S. G. Heath."
The letter was dated January 24.
at Edgefield, and sent to LVIt. Williams
of the lower house. 1
On motion of Mr. Johnstone tne j
nouse concurred in the recommenda- j
tion contained in the letter. Imme- j
aiately aftedwards, however, the house j
on a motion to withdraw the communication
from the files of the house
decided by a division vote of 24 to 23
.n the affirmative.

by Messrs. Warren of Hampton and
J. W. Boyd of Spartanburg, "looking
to the suppression of the evils of intemperance
by prohibiting the sale,
manufacture, use, consumption or storage
of liquor." The legislature will
hardly go so far as to make it a crime i
to take a drink, but there is no telling.
Certain Legral Defenses Retained. I
The house on Saturday recommitted,
with the purpose of killing, a bill by j
Mr. Moore of Abbeville that opponents
said tended to run manufacturing corporations
out of the state because the
legal defenses of contributory negligence
and assumption of risk in a case
I
of an injured employe would be practically
voided. The bill was on third
reading, having been given a second
reading without opposition.
The' author of the bill maintained
that it is similar to the federal employers'
liability act, with the principal
exception that the recovery of
damages would not be limited to those
Uipon whom some one depended.
Compulsory Education.
senator ^arnsxe & cuuipuisvi > cuucation
bill, for which ano'her was. substituted
one year ^go. has been introduced
in the senate again. This
provides for statewide compulsory attendance
of four months each school
session, of all pupils between the ages
of S and 14 years. Trustees shall

of false information would be a
S
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine-of
not more than $25. It is not -likely
that the legislature will interfere with
the present compulsory education law
at this session. <The house has already
Killed a Din to extena it. ,
Negroes in Textile Manufactories.
A bill was introduced in the senate
Friday by J. F. Williams of Aiken, to
amend the act passed one year ago,
relative to the emplayment of negroes
in textile manufactories. Violation of
the act is made a misdemeanor, each
offence punishable by a fine of not
less than $100 or imprisonment at
hard labor not more than 30 days, or
both in the discrection of the court.
A bill relating to the regulation of
textile machinery was introduced by
the same senator. The latter bill is to
prevent the running of automatic machines
in textile plants for a longer
time than required of the operators
thereof. I
Other Matters of Interest.
Senator Verner's^bill, which passed
the sena-e, to require the employment
of competent stenographers in the engrossing
department, has been favorably
reported by the house committee
The house has passed to third reading
the bill to increase the salary of
the state pension board clerk to $1,500
! per year. Miss Kate Maher is the effi;
?ient clerk of the board.
Mr. Oxner of Lexington has introduced
a bill to submit a constitutional
amendment providing that the governor
can only exercise executive
clemency upon recommendation of'the
board of pardons, but that he may refuse
to pardon upon their recommendation.
The house committee on medical af
fairs has reported favorably a bill to
require that each tablet of' bichloride
of mercury "shall be attached to a
small piece of wood so as to prevent
same from being taken by any one
into the'mouth through mistake."
Uncontested Matters.
The house tried out Friday morning
for the first time the new rule setting
aside 30 minutes each legislative day
for the consideration of uncontested
bil;s. The wisdom of the rule was
clearly exemplified by the action of
the house in giving 28 local measure?
a -second reading; the rule enables the
calendar to be cleared for action for
more important statewide measures
and will probably keep a number of
1 1 u11 ' ^rinor r>n tlio r>9 1 dlld3 T
lucai urns u um
at. the end of the session. There is
always a deluge of local bills at ?very
session.
For State Highway Commission Bill.
Thus far the house has been unable
.to get together on the bill creating the
state highway commission. For several
-days it has come before the house, buteach
time some special order has arrived,
interrupting the debate. After
n Iiaivcq a t n
some uxsuu&aivju m.c u8.wu
adjourn debate on the measure until
Tuesday at noon.
iTihe bill is meeting with strong opposition,
based not on doubt as to the
value or necessity of having good
roads, but on a question as to the advisability
of creating a commission
and employing a state highway engineer.
On the other hand it is contended
that the road system in this
state needs one head, both for the general
advancement in road construction
I .
I and for the purpose of being so or-1
ganized that the state may receive!
federal aid. South Carolina is one of
five states without a highway comj
mission.
The bill under discussion is one
j drafted by the house committee on
roads, bridges and ferries, and is the
| product of several years of study on
' the problem. There vare several other
i bills of a similar nature before the
, house and it seems probable that 'thL,

commission was begun Friday morning

; in'the senate when debate opened on

Inxtr wamnua-^i-uviw,. ~ ?? -
law creating this board. One speech
1 only was made, that by Mr. Stuckey
of I.ee. It is no fight on Governor
! Manning, the speaker said. "I have
, known him intimately for years, and
believe he'll be re-elected in spite of
his friends." Opposition is based on
the alleged unconstitutionality of the
law and "the centralization of too
much authority" in the members of
the tax commission. Mr. Stuckey is
connected with a bank at -Bishopville.
On motion of Senator Alan Johnstone
of Newberry, debate was adjourned
- ? *
until Tuesday uiormug.
The only other bill debated Friday
in tne senate was Senator Laney's bill
to prevent fire insurance companies of
this state from entering into any comi
a- to fix rates. The
| patl VViuw?*?v?v
bill is designed to promote competition,
the author claiming that the rates are

Bill Now Before the House for Consideration?Reduction

Xews and Courier. I
Columbia, Jan. 29.?The general ap^ j
propriaticn bill went into the house to- j
day and Chairman Liles has the distinction
of having introduced this most
important measure earlier than it nas
}ver before been presented. The committee
members, Chief Clerk Malcolm
'".Tiler and Mr. J. C. Townsend, chief
clerk of the engrossing department, all
worked with persistency to get the bill
iiuo the house today, so that it would
be ready for consideration 011 Monday.
The essenstial point of the bill is
that it provides for a tax levy of 6 1-2
mills, whicn is to cover all of the expenses
of the state government. Notwithstanding
the -very heavy demands
:he appropriation bill shows a net reluction
in the total of $79,260 80.
It will be interesting to note how
continuously the appropriation bill has
lung around the two million dollar
nark. These figures win oe interesting:
1914 $2,213,675.54
1913 2 463,759.82
1916 2,384,499.02
It is very much easier to undertake
o n>ake reductions in an appropriation
bill than it is to accomplish this.
Chairman Liles in a talk with the
newspaper men after the introduction
->f the hill had this comment to make:
Liles' Comment.
"The committee has faithfully endeavored
to serve the best interest of
L'ne stare. We did not appropriate in
qrrnrrianrp with out desires, but we
iav morning, and after the introducion
of the appropriation bill adjourned
:ver until Monday night at 8 o'clock.
It will be noted by an inspection of
the appropriation bill that the state
warehouse commission is c%t down
from $15,000 to $10,000, though tile
state warehouse will this year pay into
-1- ~ ~ l-.o*-, omniint I
CII0 XrCcts urj' liiu-i c luau uufll auiuuuv.
The state warehouse can not be developed
on $10,000, and certainly
should be allowed to spend for the
farmers what it brings in as revenue;
otherwise it would be tantamount to a
iax upon the farmers. It remains to
be seen the legislature will do
m this regard.
Two Valuable Members.
Newberry has two young members
of the house who are rapidly extending
their influence and field of usefulness.
They are attentive to their duties,
and they serve their county well.
'Their insight into questions pending
before the legislature and their quiet
zeal in the interests of their county
and state have attracted the attention
of the body in which they serve. *1
refer to Messrs. Neal W. Workman
and B. V. Chapman, who are representing
Newberry county worthily.
Hilary <>? Asylum Superintendent.
i ne appropriation bill as introduced
by the ways-and means committee of
the house of representatives fixes the
salary of the superintendent of the
state hospital for the insane at $5,000.
When Governor Manning appointed Dr.
(\ Fred Williams as superintendent he
issued a statement, which was published
in the Columbia State, among
other newspapers, in which the gov
ernor said:
"I nave found it necessary, in order
to get the trained, skilled physician I
was seeking for the position, to allow
a salary of $6,000, but without the residence
and without any perquisites. In
addition to the salary provided fo? in
the appropriation bill, I will personally
borrow monthly the balance of the*isalary,
standing security for the same
I and will report the matter next year
I to the legislature to reimburse me if
I it agrees in what I have done." j
This statement was published on
April 15, 1915.
The ways and means committee evi
dently does not take the same view as
to the necessity for $G.OOO which was
taken by the governor, but goes ahead
and increases the salary from $3,000
to $5,000, which is $2,000 more fhan is
raid the governor of the state.
believ* we appropriated as the condiI
ixuii of the state's finances justified.
I The most careful consideration has
^ been given every item and we feel
| sure that the actual needs of every
! department and every institution have
jbeen supplied, and we think we hav?
j provided funds for extension and im|
provements where the needs for such j
[ were great. ?The work of the commit- j
tee has been absolutely harmonious, j
All differences were settled in the com- j
mittee room and we are ready to stand ;
by our work. I can not speak too j
highly of the faithfulness of the mem
bers of the committee. It has been a
day and night job since January 11.

efforts will prove satisfactory to the
people of the state. It will be noted
that for ordinary state purposes we
have appropriated less than $2,000,000.
The amount for pensions and for the
improvement of the State Hospital for
the Insane increases the total as j
shown. We have carried out the reso- j
lution of the committee to keep the \
amount raised by levy within $2,000,- \
000 and have reduced the levy one-half
mill."
The appropriation bill is a very long
document, consisting of forty-two
itemized sections, but the following recapitulation
will show where the committee
expects the state to use its
funds.
