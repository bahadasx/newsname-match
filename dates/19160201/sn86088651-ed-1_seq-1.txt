Austin. Tex. Feb. 1. Attorney Gen
eral Looney haa been requested by
the elate tax board to assist the de
fense In the numerous suits filed by
the International A Great Northern
Railroad contesting the Intsnglble as

and Mr. Looney baa assigned Luther
Nickels to that task. Mr. Nickel, la

tax questions pertaining to them. Sev

the attorney general to lend help In
defending the sulu and Mr. Nickels
will be sent to them. Among the
counties applying la Travia.
Two counts stand out prominently
In the suits. First the contention thst

Intangible value; but. if it haa. the
amount la much less thsn the figure
named by the state tas board and sec
ond, thst locsl discrimlnstion hss oc
curred In fixing the valuations for tax
ation purpoaea. While the first ques
tion waa once decided In the federal
courta. It waa only in n preliminary In
junction, and therefore may be raised
sgaln. Mr. Nickels will devote his time
to that question and the local county
attorneys to defending the charge of
discrimination In local assessments.
Inasmuch aa the International A
Great Northern baa filed these suits
In thirty-eight counties and Mr. Nlck
ela will probably participate In a ma
jority of the caaea. It la going to take
some energeUc work to get aronud to
all of them, especially where conflicts
occur In settings.
When the Intangible asset tax law
waa first enacted Ita constitutionality

went the gauntlet of the courts and
is regarded aa valid. Attacka now muat
