AFRAID OF DANGER
OF INADEQUATE DEFENCE
Declares Time May Come When
He Cannot Keep the Nation
Out of War.
ADDRESS IN CLEVELAND
URGENT PLEA TO PREP ARE
Says Navy and Coast Defences
Should Be Strengthened
Materially.
Cleveland, O., Jan. 29.?Presi-I
dent Wilson, speaking as he said,
"solemnly," warned the nation
that the time may come when he
cannot both keep the United
States out of war and maintain
its honor. He declared that the
country must be prepared to defend
itself and prepared at once.
++ "America is not afraid of anybody,"
he said. "I know I rellect
your feeling and the feeling of
all of our citizens when I 3ay the
only thing I am afraid of is not
being ready to perform my duty.
I am afraid of the danger of inadequancy;
I am afraid of the
danger of not being able to express
the chief character of this1
country with tremendous might j
and effectiveness whenever we
are called upon to act in the field
of the world's affairs."
The president spoke in Cleve-.
land with more gravity and force i
A 1 1 1 _ 1_ .1 ? /?
man ne nas snown nunng any ot
his previous addresses on preparedness.
He was applauded frequently!
and when he spoke of defending'
the nation's honor the cheering
was trenmendous.
"Let me tell you very solemnly
you cannot postpone this
thing," he declared. "I do not
know what a single day may
^ bring forth. I do not wish to
leave you with the impression
that I am thinking of some particular
danger.
"1 merely wfsTTto tell you that
We are daily treading amidst inintricate
dangers. The dangers
ip that we are treading amongst are
not of our own making and not
under our control. I think no
man in the United States knows
what a single week, a single day.
may bring forth."
Again and again the president
spoke of the nation's honor. He
declared the real man believes I
his honor is dearer than is life,
and a nation's honor is dearer
than its peace and comfort. Ho
said it had been difficult to keep
the United States out of the war
and he felt he had nroved h w is 1
a man of peace when possible.
He expressed regret that Ihe
question has come up in a campaign
year.
"T/et us forget." he said, "that
this is a year of national elections."
The preparedness issue
he added, should have nothing to
do with politics.
For the first time during his
present tour the president snoke
0 of the navy .and of the coast defences.
The latter, he said, are
good in quality hut not in quantity.
Some people say that the navy
ranks second, he declared, but,
the experts agree it ranks;
fourth. He added it should bo
increased.
Among the possible sources of
danger mentioned by the president
were the difficulties growing
out of the protection of
Ameriirtiis abroad and the obligation
of the United States to
maintain the liberties of the people
of the Western Hemisphere.

IN VALLBY FLOODS
Great Areas in California Made
Desolate by Overflows and
Cloudbursts.
San Diego, Cal., Jan 29.? (By
wireless to San Francisco.)?One
hundred lives have been lost, as
nearly as any estimate can show
and valleys for fifty miles north
of the Mexican line lie desolate
from floods and cloudbursts.
With the death toll in the
Otay valley seemingly established
at fifty, reports reached here
late today of floods sweeping the
San Luis Rey and San Pasqual
valleys, doubling the loss of life.
With communication almost cut
off it was impossible to list ac-'
curately the number of dead.

Topeka, Kans., Feb. 1.?The
possibility of New York women
coming to Kansas to register as

us," she wrote, "after having
worked for so many years in the
?tate of New York for our enfrancisement,
to qualify as voters

those who qualify in Kansas to'
snend nart of their time in thp i
Iowa campaign. Iowa wili vote

has ben announced.
The New York women will be

j INTRODUCED IN HOUSE
Important Measure Sent in By
Chairman Liles Earlier
Than Ever Before.
ALL OVER $2,000,000 MARK
FROM FEES AND LICENSES i
Bill Provides for Tax Levy of
6 1-2 Mills, Which is to
Cover State Expenses.
Columbia, Jan. 29.?The general
appropriation bill went into
the house Saturday and Chairman
Liles has the distinction of
having introduced this most im-;
nortant measure earlier than it,
has ever before been presented.!
The committee members, Chief j
Clerk Malcolm Miller, and J. C. j
Townsend, chief clerk of the en-1
grossing department, all worked
with persistency to get the bill
into the house Saturday so that
it could be ready for consideration
on Monday.
The essential point of the bill
's that it provides for a tax levy
of 6 1-2 mills, which is to cover
all of the expenses of the state
government. Notwithstanding
the very heavy demands the ap-!
nropriation bill shows a net reduction
in the total of $79.260.80.1
It will be interesting to note J
how continuously the appropriation
bill has hung around the
two million dollar mark. These ,
figures will be interesting:
191 4 $2,213,675 54
1915 2 463 7-o so
1016 2,384.499.02
Tt is very much easier to undertake
to make reductions in an
appropriation bill than it is to I
accomplish this.
Chairman Liles in a talk with
the newspaper men after the introduction
of the bill had tlu?v
comment to make:
"The committee has faithful-1
ly endeavored to serve the best I
interest of the state. We did not j
appropriate in accordance with
our desires, but we believe we appropriated
as the condition of the
state's finances justified. The
most careful consideration has
been given every item jind we
feel sure that the actual needs of
every department and every in- j
stitution have been supplied, and
we think we have provided funds
for extension and improvements
where the needs for such were
gre?t. The work of the committee
has been absolutely harmonious.
All differ -nces were settled
i" the committee room and we
nre ready to stand bv our work.
I cannot speak too highly of the
faithfulness of the members of
the committee. It has been a day
and night iob since January 1 1.
We are hopeful that ihe results
of our efforts will prove satisfactory
tt> the peon I o of the state.
It will be noted that for ordinary
state purposes we have appropriated
less than $2,000,000. The
amount for pensions and for the
i 4- 1 I- ? Oa._ a r*
u:i|>i wvriillTUI UI lilt* itT.f 1 1 OSnital
for the Insane increases the
total as shown. We have carried
out the resolution of the
committee to keep the amount
raised by levy within $2,000,000
and have reduced the levy onehalf
mill."
The appropriation bill is a very
long document, consisting of
forty-two itemized section.

MEASURE UP FOR

Carlisle Would Cut Topers'
Monthly Allowance From
Gallon to Quart.
Columbia, Jan. 31.?The senate
tonight passed to third readind
the bill providing for disposal
of the left-over stocks of liquors
in former dispensary counties.
The bill was amended so as to allow
the sheriffs in the counties to
dispose of the stocks outside of
the state, and allows the sheriffs
the same fees for transacting
this business as provided for
their regulai business. The fixtures
and furniture will be sold
by the sheriffs at public auction.
It was seen by those behind
the bill that it was impossible to
get through any legislation allowing
dispensaries to be reopened
in this state. They agreed on
the amendment, which was offered
bv Senator I.ide for the stocks
left on hand to be sold in some of
the "wet" states. The money to
bf. received from such sales, after
deducting expenses, will go
into the ordinary and school
funds of the counties.
Senator Carlisle ha^ an amendment.

down the quantity of liquor one

one gallon to one quart a month.
The hill providing for a joint
committee from the senate and
house, to supervise all printing,
