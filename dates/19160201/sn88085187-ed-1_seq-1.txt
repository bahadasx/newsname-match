In a page-one editorial a few

Tacoma Wants
No Return to
Spoils System
Tomorrow it will be up to the city council
to dispose of a resolution looking to the aboli
tion of Tacoma's civil service system.
There is just one course to be pursued by the
counci 1, if its members wish to act in accord
with good sense and with the wishes of the ma
jority of Tacomans.
That is to file and forget the resolution.
There positively is no demand for doing
away with the present plan, except on the part
of a few inefficient workers who are unable to
obtain city jobs because they cannot come up
to the required standards, a few cheap poli
ticians who would like to have a finger in the
appointments and a few mossbacks who con
sider that the methods which they learned in
their youths are the best of all possible meth
ods.
Tacoma does not want to return to the spoils
system. What alterations is to be made in our
civil service system must be an improvement
of the system, not its destruction.

FLOODS
MENACE
If Chinook Wind
Should Blow It
Would Do Vast
Damage Here
One of the worst floods in the
history of Tacoma will occur if a
Chinook wind melts the present
heavy blanket of snow that covers
Western Washington.
The danger from a chlnook is
chiefly to the speed with which
it converts the snow to water.
City and county authorities are
watching the weather anxiously
today, fearing for the safety of
bridges, sewers and other public
improvements the minute that
the thaw sets In.
James Hayes, county bridge
inspector, consulted with mem
bers of the city council today
over the condition of city bridges.
It is believed that all city bridges
are strong enough to withstand
any flood.
Low Today, But—
"The Puyallup and other riv
ers are still very low today," de
clared the bridge inspector.
"But with all this slushy suow
on the ground, a warm wind
would cause floods of almost un
heard of proportions. I think
that all of the county bridges
are safe enough to withstand
the high water, but one never
can tell what might happen In
flood time.
The rivers are low today be
cause the slight warm spell in
Tacoma did not affect the foot
hills v here the rivers get their
conception. Freezing weather
still prevails there."
City Hall Leaks.
Today's slight thaw caused
endless trouble in Tacoma
So heavy did the snow become
on the 11th street bridge, that it
was necessary to send a squad of
men to clear It off before the lift
could be raised. "There were 75
tons of wet snow on the bridge,
and it wouldn't budge an Inch
until we had the weight re
moved," said Commissioner
Woods.
The roof of the city hall
threatened to collapse today
when eight inches of snow on It
began to melt. The pressure of
the soggy snow caused the roof
to bulge downwards in several
places, and several leaks formed
sending streams of water down
Into the offices below. Work
men shoveled a large part of the
snow away.
Sewers Are Heavily Loaded.
Sewers are filled to capacity
with slush and water. No breaks
have occurred. Commissioner
Woo-s declared today that Im
mense damage would occur If
another freeze-up comes at this
time.
City snow plows that have here
tofore been pulled by two horses
required four animals to pull
them through the wet. slush to

Where Do You
Stand on Rates,
Mr. Governor?
(AN OPEN LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR)
Gov. Ernest Lister:—We are not addressing
this note to you in any spirit of complaint. We
know you are a very busy man these days,
but—
We want to ask you this:
Why aren't you joining with us folks in
fighting to get back the rightful tourist travel
to our northwest cities, of which the southern
railroads have been allowed to rob us by un
just discriminatory passenger rates?
We are in the fight, every one of us - hotel
men, shipping men, business men, auto clubs,
commercial organizations. All-except that
one degenerated, dying-by-inches Seattle
Chamber of Commerce. And that one can't
get in because its patched breeches are weight
ed down to the runboards with railroad money.
Is there any reason, Mr. Governor, why you,
as the chosen leader of the folks of Washing
ton, should not take an active leadership in
' this fight?
J -Surely you are too wise to be buffaloed by
*%the wheedling, lying complaints of the prize
' double crossers representing the Seattle Cham
ber^ Commerce.
Speak out, Mr. Governor.

USED FOR BOOST
IN PHONE RATES,
NOT FOR TAXES
Solved—the myWerjr of
tlie missing millions!
No, we haven't found all
those intangible bits of
pri>l>ert.y of the Pacific
which the company says it
knows it owns but just can't
locate.
Nor have we discovered
the gold trimmings or some
thing whk'U, according to
the figures of UM phone
company to the public serv
ice commission, have more
than doubled the price of
telephone itoles In the last
six years.
But though we have not found
the missing telephone millions
(and It is very likely that nobody
ever will) the mystery has been
cleared. The clue was found in
a dry old law book (Chap. 182,
House Bill No. .28) in a para
graph of a law passed by that
notorious legislature of ours
which sat In the halls of Olympia
In the year 1913.
The paragraph was stuck away
in an insignificant, out-of-the
way place where nobody would
be likely to find It, except those
who had It put there—ln case of
emergency.
Here's what it says—that the
valuations of corporations' prop
erty, as made by the commission,
"shall be admissible in evidence
in any action, proceeding or
hearing, EXCEPTING WITH
RESPECT TO MATTERS OF
ASSESSMENT AND TAXA
TION."
Get It? It's made to order—
for the very purpose of allowing
this telephone company of tak
ing just as much cash out of '.ts
patrons' pockets as it thinks it
can get away with.
Just l*ure Myth.
That mlsßlng million dollars
worth of property which the
company says It owns, and that
so-called million dollar jump in
the price of telephone poles nev
er have been, never are and nev
er shall be, world without end.
The little joker, or rider, or
whatever you may call It, In the
public service law amendment of
1913, encourages a corporation
such as the phone company to
slap on figures by the dozens in
the valuation of Its property be
fore the public service commis
sion la order to get the very
highest rates possible from Its
patrons.
For the law protects them. It
says our county assessor cannot
take the company's padded val
uations and assess the company
onists I was sold. Naples had
been the doorkeeper of my room
and he admitted many men. The
dance was hrcaklng up and it
was getting toward dawn. I \va»
terribly ill.
"Naples called the men bacK
and said I would be auctioned off.
Then they brought me down nude,
but I was too ill to know much of
what was going on. Then they
placed me on a stage and held me
there while the brutes bid.
"I was delirious, but I could
faintly hear them—s2s, $30, $33.
and then by $1 and 60-cent In
creases until I was sold to some
one for $s.i 1 don't know who
bought me, for 1 became uncon
scious and woke up In the cottage
where the detectives found me."
Naples, the alleged abductor, Is
under arrest, but he was taken
only alter a struggle in which de
tectives beat him nearly uncon
scious to subdue him.
After the girl disappeared, it la
charged, he terrorized her parent*
with threats to out out their
hearts if they sought to connect
him with the case.
accordingly. The figures sworn
to before the public service com
mission, cannot be used by the
assessor In slumming on the
taxes.
By no means. The corpora
tion must submit an entirely new
set of figures to our county as-.
sessors, The assessor, in spite
of the fact that a valuation al
ready has been made, must waste
the taxpayers' money In making
a new valuation and assessment.
Had Hunch, Maybe.
The property valuation sub
mitted by the company to the as
sessor for taxation is just as ex
tremely low as that submitted to
the public service commission for
rate making is extremely bulky
with padding.
Something must have turned
over at the state capital between
1911 and 1913. Perhaps the
phone company had a hunch the
rate hearing was coming up be
fore long. It Is certain the com
pany didn't like the looks of the
original law of 1911, which said:
"When the commission
shall have valued the prop
eity of any public service
company nothing less than
tbe market value so found
by the commission shall i><>
taken us a true value of the
propni.v of such company
used for the public conveni
ence for the purpose of as
sessment und taxation."
8o at the hearing In the Fed
eral building the phone company
is taking unto Itself property _y
the millions. At least or.c mil
lion of this it says can't be
found. Another million it says
is attached to its telephone poles.
And ho on, until they have val
ued their property, for the pur
pose of making rates, at $10,
--000,Ono more than the stale en
gineers value it.
Tax this $10,000,000. No
chance!
The legislators of 1913 put up
a fence to hide behind when it
comes to taxation.
Now if the company could only
bluff Chairman Reynolds and
the rest of the public servlee
commission, we phoners would
have to pay.
But the public service commis
sion isn't going to be buncoed.
