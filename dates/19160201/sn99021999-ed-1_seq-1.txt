CHARLESTON, S. C. Jan. 31. No
word has been received up to 9 a.
m. today from the submarine K-5 or
from the vessels which are searching
for 1t, according to navy yard of
ficials. The K-6 has been missing
since 1 o'clock Sunday morning and
has not responded to wireless calls
ent out from short stations and
naval vessels, leading marine men to
helieve that the boat had suffered
at least an accident to Its wireless
apparatus. A heavy tog hung over
the coast between here and Cape Ito-
main, forty miles north of here,
where the submersible was last
sighted, making more difficult the
task of the searchers.

They were held outside all night be
cause of the dense fog.

Officials Not Alarmed.
WASHINGTON, Jan. sl.-The where
abouts of the submarine K-6 remained
unknown to navy officials here early to
day. The officials were not alarmed by
the absence of any report from the sub
marine. They believe it may have ex
perienced trouble with lta engines, but

ers Sterrett and Perkins, en route from

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 31. All, ef

of coast guard ships and war wessels to
locate the missing submarine K-6 had
been futile up to late today. Navy de

thay were not fearful of the loss of the
submarine and thought it possible with

separated from the flotilla and gone on
alone to the submarine base at Key

All the boats of th K-class, officials
