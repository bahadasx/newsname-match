TEACHERS
PROVES
RECORD
The Teachers' Convention con
cluded Friday evening in a highly
interesting, assorted program, the
leading features of which were the
set addresses by James A. Wilder
on the Boys Scout movement and
by Professor Dean, of the College
of Hawaii, on "Science and Educa
tion," These will be treated at
greater length in the next issue of
this paper. There were excellent
musical features. After all was
over the hall was cleared and danc
ing began, lasting to a late hour.
The annual meeting of the Kau
ai Teachers Association held Fri
day, the twenty eighth, in Lihue is
generally conceded to have been
the most successful in the history
of that organization. With the
exception of the Kilauea, Kapahi
andNiihau teachers, who had been
formally excused, the entire teach
ing force was in attendance and the
added presence of, numerous
friends and guests rendered the
meeting one of inspiration and
value.
The meeting was called to order
at 9:30 by Pies. Th. Brandt. Sec.
H. C. Brown suggested that the
secretary's report be dispensed
with, according to former custom,
and later be published for the
.benefit of the association.
if Miss Etta Lee delivered the
treasurer's report, stating that $62
.84 were in the treasury of the as
sociation. '
Mr. Eric Knudsen, the Com
missioner of Education for Kauai,
was then unanimously elected as
president and Mr. Brown and Miss
Lee were voted to remain in office.
In retiring, Mr. Brandt, who has
been Commissioner and president
duriug the past two years, ex
pressed himself as having found
his work most pleasurable and
asked that the same consideration
he had received from all be ex
tended to his successor.
Pres. Knudsen stated that his
association with the schools as
Commissioner had proved to him
that contrary to his former point
of view, he now realized the bene
fit of the schools to the public.
"All money," he said, that is ob
tained by the schools is indeed
well appropriated and well spent.
The program for the morning
session was devoted entirely to
practical teaching methods and
the subjects English and Geo
f graphy held the most important
place.
The paper of Miss Maclntvre, of
the Kauai High School on "Eng
lish Preparation for t h e Hjgh
School" was of very practical
value in relation to the schools ot
Hawaii. She stated that all school
work shbuld fit the mass of stu
dents tor the work-a-day world in
to which they were to go. She
urged that English should be made
to form a vital part of the life of
the children o f all nationalities
through drill, simple and practical
composition, and above all through
oral use in the ichool and on the
playground. The use of pictures
leading to impromptu oral com
position, less formal and more
functional grammar, the choice of
selections suited to the interests of
the children and the use of good
books outside of the school, were
the points that were brought out
most clearly.
A discussion led by Miss Hund
ley in a clever and interesting
manner followed during which
Mr. Avery explained the attitude
of the course of study committee on
CONVENTION
SUCCESS
the various selections advocated
by that body,
Miss Glenn, of Koloa. with the
idea that the school should be a
place of happiness, developed a
very real lesson in phonics and
proved that a teacher should be
willing to do anything in order, to
bring definite ideas before the
children.
President Knudsen warned the
teachers that the ability to run
might very soon become one of the
requirements.
The very clever texts quoted
from Scripture by Mrs. Mesick of
Hanamaulu on the most vital sub
ject of "devices" delighted every
one, Mr. Brodie included, and made
n pleasant introduction lor her
talk on "Number Work."
The subject of Geography meth
ods was treated by Mrs. Maude
Thompson, of Lihue, Mrs. Bridge
water of Hanamaulu, and Mr.
Brown of Wainiea in an interest
ing wav. Much excellent illustra
tive material was shown to make
the subject really fascinating to
children. Mrs Bridgewater's re
cipe for map modelling of 2-3 cup
flour, 1-3 cup salt and water to
form soft dough was greeted most
enthusiastically.
One of the most inspiring talks
of the day was given bv Mrs,
Heapy of Mana, on the "One room
school" in which she brought out
the powerful influence of the teach
er npon the character of the chil
dren under her and the way in
which the common miracles of na
ture could become a daily joy to
the little ones in isolated commu
nities. The luncheon hour having now
come, the meeting was adjourned
until the afternoon. The teachers
and gnests repaired to the Fair
v i e w hotel where a delicious
lunch was served to over a hun
dred and fifty people. The dining
room, lanais, halls, and stairways
were utilized by everyone and
much credit is due to those in
charge for the way in which the
meal was served.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
During the afternoon session,
the addresses applied to the larger
questions related to the teaching
profession rather than the methods
and subjects taught,
Mr. Coney in his address, "The
Legislature," clearly showed the
process by which laws are made
and the various steps through
which they pass. He described
the work of the committees, stating
that financial matters, altho they
might relate to school questions,
were always broucht before the
finance and not the education
committee. The budget of finan
cial expense is made out by the
Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion and is then passed upon by
the legislature. Therefore, if there
is not enough money for school
expenses, the fault lies not with
the legislature, but w i t h the
Superintendent. He then explain
ed the tabling of recommendations
either by Senate on House and the
various other fates that befall a
bill even after it has been intro
duced.
The subject of Mr, Brandt's ad
dress was changed from that on
the program to the Y. M. C. A.
work. He spoke of the import
ance of such an organization for
rural districts wheie so little is
done to occupy a young man's
time outside of school or working
hours. Sympathetic leaders, train
ed for the position, have a tre

President Tempers Speech
Chicago The President spoke in Minneapolis last night, but his
speech was a great deal more moderate than the one delivered in New
York. He tempered his warning of lurking danger. He said among
other things that the navv is prepared for war, but that there was no
cause tor apprehension of a national calamity. Huge crowds greeted
the president.

mendous influence on the young
men under them. He then out
lined the plan for Kauai, under
which a trained leader would have
charge of the whole island with the.
districts under him. Not much
money would be spent for equip-'
ment, but the personality of a
leader who would work in sym
pathetic co-operation with the
young men would be the power to
influence them.
It happened that Mr. Lootnis,
the Y. M. C. A. secretary, who
has been on Kauai this week, was
present, and h e was asked to
speak, fie mentioned some of the
durational movements with which
he had bedn in touch and the dif-j
ferent methods which would ap
peal to the Kauai ter.chers. He
expressed his appreciation of the
offer to remain on Kauai as the Y.
M. C A. leader.
If the plans in regard to the
association work materialize, the
center will be at Eleele where a
building lot has been obtained and
a motor car will be in use to carry
the young men back and forth.
Different local clubs will be under
the general direction of the reg
ular secretary and competitive
games, etc., will take place.

Employes, Liability
Since theie seems to be some
misapprehension on the part of
employers leading, to a very gener
al neglect in reporting accidents
as required by the Industrial Acci
dent Law, I beg to re-itctate that
this law requires that a formal re
port be made to the accident com
mission, first, when the accident
causing disability happens, and,
second, when that disabilitv
ceases, together with the details of
any settlement that may have been
made under the law. These re
ports should be made promptly,
and neglect to make them involves
liability to fine.
All reports should be made to
the secretary, who wfll furnish the
necessary blanks to those needing
them.
