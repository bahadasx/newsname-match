which Secretary Lansing has gone In
his demand fnr an unconditional dis

Tho refusal to arbitrate. It was
learned, was based on the ground that,
the "vl'tal Interests and national honor"
of the fnlted .States being Involved, the
matter was one which could not he sub

It was the second time such a pto
posal has been turned down, and It was
rejected finally at tho last cnufcrenen
which the Seiicttiry of State had with
Ambassador von Hernstorlf.
The tlrst proposal was made soon
after tho l.usltanlii was sunk. At that
tlmo It was rejected on tho ground that
the United States had no assurances
that pendliiK an arbitral decision by the
Hague court, to which Uennany pro
posed to submit tho dispute, Hermany
would not continue, sinking merchant
vchsels without warniuK.

rules lu themselves are not unreasonable;
it only iheie is some ualantee hat they

have taken place on cloudy nr.d foggy
