of ideals and principles that are in us.
"They do not feel the conviction of

six months was merely the beginning
of the struggle. Another year has been
added, and now no man can compe

will be drawn into the struggle. There

should take counsel together as to what
is necessary that we shoud do. -
".The circumstances of the day are
so extraordinary that perhaps it
is not prudent for a man upon whom
the responsibilities of affairs are laid
to know too particularly the details of

that they cannot look upon it as those

NO CRISIS SMS
WILSON in m
IT HUE
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
.MILWAUKEE, Jan. 31. The presi
dent in his speech here this afternoon,
said there was no crisis and nothing
new, but that the world was disturbed
by passion such as never had been
seen before, and that it was necessary
to set our own house in order, to make
certain we should not suffer by the
.rcneral disturbance
enerai uisiuruance.
"America has drawn her blood and
her energy out of almost all the: na
tions of the world," he said. "It is
true of a great many of us that there
lies deep in iur hearts th recollec
tion of an origin which is not Ameri
can. i know the impulses
which have drawn men to our shores.
"And I know that whenever the test
comes every man's heart will be first
for America. And whereer thev
come from, it was the principle and
iffection and ambition and hope that
drew men to these shores. And they
are nut going to forget the errar.d
upon which they came and the Ameri
ca which they have made their refuge
and their hope will not suffer by any
forgetfulness on their part."
"We can control irresponsible talk
ers amidst ourselves," continued Ihe
president. "All we have got to do is
to encourage them to hire a hall and
their folly will ite abundantly adver
tised by themselves."
"Thert is no part of the world ex
cept South America to which the direct
influence of this struggle has not ex
tended, and so we are surrounded by
this tremendous disturbance and you
must realize what that involves. Our
thoughts are concentrated upon our
affairs and our own relations with the
rest of the world, but the thoughs of
men who are engaged in this struggle
are concentrated upon the struggle it
self and there is daily, and hourly,
danger that they will feel themselves
constrained to do things which are ab
solutely inconsistent with the rights of
the United States. They are not
thinking of us. I am not criticising
them even for not thinking of us. i
dare say that if I were in their places
neither would 1 think of us. Tlu-y be
lieve that they are struggling for their
lives.
"If the I'nited States puts its inter
ests in the path of this struggle she
ought to know before hand that there
is danger of very serious misunder
standing and difficulty. So that the
very uncalculated, unpremeditated
one might say almost accidental course
of affairs may touch us to the ipiick
at any moment. And I want you to
realize that standing in the midst of
these difficulties I feel that X am
charged with a double duty of the ut
most difficulty. In the first place, I
know that you are depending upon me
to keep this nation out of war.
"So f ir I have done so. And I pledge
"on my word that God helping me, I
will if it is possible. But you have
laid another duty on me. You have
bidden me see that nothing stains or
impairs the honor of the I'nited States.
And that is a matter not within my
control. That depends, on what others
do, not upon what the government of
the United States does, and therefore
there may at any moment come a time
when I cannot both preserve the honor
and th peace of the United States. Do
not exact of me an impossible and con
tradictory thing but stand ready and
insist that everybody who represents
you should stand ready to provide the
means for maintaining the honor of th.'
United States.
"I sometimes think that it is tru?
that no people ever went to war with
n nether people. Governments have
gone to war with one another, but peo
ples so far as I remember have ncjt. and
this government of the people and this
people is not going to choose war. Rut
we are not dealing with peoples. We
are dealing wit'n governments. We are
dealing with governments now engaged
in a grat struggle and therefore we do
not know what a day or an hour will
bring forth. All that we- know is th ?
character of our own duty. We do
not want the question of peace and
war. or the conduct of war, entrusted
too entirtlv to our governments. W?
want war. if it must come, to be some
thing that, springs out of sentiments.
no principles anc tne action ot tne
people themselves.
"And it is on that account that I am
counselling the, congress of the United
States not to take the advice of thos3
who reccommend that we should have,
and have very soon, a great standing
irniv, but on te contrary, to see to it
that llie citizens of the country are so
trained, and tint equipment is so suf
ficiently provided for them that, hen
ever they choose, they can take ' up
arms and defend themselves.
'The constitution of the United
States makes the president the com-rnander-in-chief

of Europe
Republican A. P. i-eased Wire
After having driven the Turks from
a region about forty miles in length
in Asiatic Turkey to the west of Lake
Van and put them to retreat down
the Mush valley, the Russians seem
ingly have ceased their operations in
this" particular district for the win
ter. Large numbers of prisoners were
taken by the Russians in their drive
of the Turks, in addition to heavy
guns, machine guns and other war
material.
The Russian official communication
confirms previous statements that the
Turks, to the! northwest of this re
gion, have been driven into the for
tifications of Erzef'um.
There has been little fighting of
great moment anywhere in any of
the war theaters except by the artil
lery. German positions at Steen
straete. to the south of Roye, and
to the north of St. Mihiel, have come
under the guns of the entente allies
on the western line, and considerable
damage has been done. The last
French communication does not men
tion fighting in the vicinity of Neu
ville or south of the Somme, where
positions recently were captured by
the Germans. The Berlin report,
however, says these positions have
been held against repeated attacks.
From northwest of Riua to the mid
dle Stripa there has been a considera
ble bombardment by the Germans of
various Russian towns and positions.
Petrograd reports the surrounding by
Russians of an Austrian detachment
in the middle Stripa. and the anni
hilation of most of the Austrians, the
remainder being captured.
The Italians and the Austrians have
opened another fierce artillery duel
along the Isonzo front.
Zeppelins invade England
LONDON, Feb. 1. A raid by six
or seven Zeppelin airships took place
last night over the eastern, north
eastern and midland countries of Eng
land, according to announcement of
the war office.
A number i t bombs were dropped
but up to the present no considerable
damage has been reported.
Discussing the possibility of serious
damage to London from a Zeppelin at
tack, the Times says:
"Any raid intended to do serious
damage to London, the defenses of
which are still in process of develop
ment, is not likely to be of the hap
hazard nature of the I'aris raids. Jt
remains for us to provide a really
serious reception.
Hitherto London's principal efforts
this direction' consist chiefly " of
guns largely manned by cheery, but in
experienced and ill-equipped amateurs.
No one who witnessed the raids on
London last autumn can have failed to
have been impressed by the inade
quacy of the defensive preparations.
Since then, considerable progress has
been made hut we should be better
satisfied if we had also sufficient
aeroplanes to attack the raiders."
The Russian Statement
I'ETROGRAD, via London, Jan. 31.
The war office communication issued
today says :
"The German artillery lias bom
barded Shlok and opened an active fire
in the region south of Lake Babit. The
enemy fired on our trenches near Oger
(region of Mitau) with explosive bul
lets from machine guns.
"North of the Poniewseh railroad
and between Lakes, Medmousk and
Drmmen the enemy opened a violent ar
tillery fire.
"On the middle Htripa our scouts sur
rounded an Austrian detachment of
rural .guards. In the hand to hand
encounter that ensued, most of the
Austrians were bayonettetf; The oth
ers were captured.
"A great increase in the number of
enemy deserters has been observed
recently.
"We now descend from the moun
tainous regions with their rigorous
climate into regions well populated and
easily accessible, and favorable for the
encampment of our troops for the per
iod of the winter.
"In the course of these operations we
took numerous prisoners of Turkish
officers and Askarts and guns, machine
guns, great quantities of artillery and
engineering material.
"On the 29th our scouts pursued the
Turks, falling back in the.region of the
Tchoruk river, and took many Askaris
prisoner and seized a number of
cattle."

forty sailors, from the temporary naval
wireless station outfitted early today
in a brick schoolhouse in the Otay
valley.
Rear Admiral Fuliam said that he
had instructed Lieutenant Bradley to
order his men to use every method they
could employ to induce sixty or more
scantily clothed, ill nourished and
poorly housed women and children to
allow themselves to be escorted out of
the Otay and Tia Juana valleys, where
conditions were reported to him as im
proving hut slowly.
"The water situation in the Otay and
Tia Juana valleys is bad," the ad
miral said, "and I have issued a warn
ing that all water for domestic uses
should be boiled to avoid illness. I
urged that the flood sufferers remain
ing in remote and isolated parts of
these districts allow us to help them
reach San Diego, where the relief com
mittee will see that they are given
proper attention."
Looting in the Otay valley was first
reported to Rear Admiral William F.
Fuliam, commanding the Pacific re
serve fleet, yesterday morning, soon
after he ordered marines and steamers
into the devastated district as relief
and rescue parties.
The marines and sailors were pro
vided with arms and twenty rounds ot
ammunition each, and orders were
given them to "shoot looters on the
spot."
The arrests today were the first
made since it was reported that armed
Mexicans were in the upper part of the
valley, just below the wrecked Lower
Otay dam, engaged in looting.
Sheriff Ralph Conklin, who returned
today from the Otay and Tia Juana
valleys with the statement that the ser
vices of himself and deputies were no
longer needed and that the naval
forces were ample to cope with any
emergency, said he believed the reports
of looting by Mexicans were exagger
ated. No reports of further casualties in
the flooded areas were received today,
and there was a marked absence of
rumors of wrecked bridges and burst
ing dams such as have stirred San
Diego and nearby communities since
the Lower Otay was wrecked Thurs
day night. Coroner Otto Marsh said
no more bodies had been recovered, nor
had identification been made of bodies
reported to have been found at various
points.
Spencer M. Marsh, district attorney
of San Diego county, exploded a rumor
to the effect that a grand jury investi
gation of the bursting of the Otay dam
was contemplated.
Of chief interest to residents here in
connection with developments growing
out of the floods, was the information
that the city's water system had been
crippled to an extent that made it nec
essary to negotiate with a private
water company for water with which
to fill the Chollas Heights resrvoirs.
The Chollas Heights reservoirs only
bold a supply sufficient for the city's
needs for fifteen days.
This fact developed at a meeting of
the city council in the forenoon when
it was reported that a pipe line break
afld a clogged conduit had shut off the
supply from the Morena and Upper
Otay reservoirs.
While relief for sufferers was being
looked after by the Chamber of Com
merce committee and the naval au
thorities, its district workers, city of
ficials, including Mayor E. M. CappB,
discussed possible reconstruction of the
Lower Otay dam.

"When it comes to rebuilding the
Otay dam I propose as a public of
ficial to have something to say," the
mayor said. "The only thing to con
sider is a dam that will last forever,
no matter what the cost."
At a meeting today of the Chamber
of Commerce relief committee with
city officials and business men it was
decided that efforts woujd be made to
raise a relief fund of as close to $100,000
as possible. It was believed this sum
would prove ample for all require
ments. The fund started on Saturday
had been increased to about $30,000
late in the day.
John F. West, county superintendent
of schools, announced that he would
officially recommend to the school
trustees of the various districts af
fected by the floods to close the schools
for one month. He said he believed it
would take that long to open roads so
as to make regular attendance possible.
Announcement was made late today
that large consigments of merchan
dise and food supplies, locked by de
moralized railroad traffic north of
here, were being transferred at San
Pedro to ships and would be for
warded here by the water route.
Santa Ve railroad officials here said
that the steamship Raleigh was due
here tomorrow with 32 carloads of
delayed merchandise, seven carload:
of potatoes and a carload of onions.
What loomed for several days as a
threatening shortage of beef was re

Bridges on the Santa Fe railroad
