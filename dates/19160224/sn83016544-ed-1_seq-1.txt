The creamery project, which hai
been lying dprinant for some time
is to be made a live issue from now
on until definite results are achieved.
The foundation has been laid, by
the organization o! a cooperative
creamery association, and it is up to
the people of the county to give to
it the support that self interests
dictates.
The committee appointed for that
)urpose met recently and pre­
pared a draft of by-laws for the
association, to be submitted at a
future meeting of the stockholders
for adoption. These proposed by
aws are copied largely from the by­
laws of successful cooperative cream­
eries of the state, and a perusal of
them gives a very good idea of the
general plan of operation of such
Enterprise.
The committee desires that these
roposed by-laws be carefully con­
sidered by every person who is in
any w«y interested in this enterprise
and for that purpose have submitted
the same for publication in the
Herald. Lack of time prevents the
publication this week, but they will
appear in next issue,
By being thus carefully considered
the plan finally adopted should be
the best possible to be devised to
suit local conditions.

Ressrvation Notes
Your correspondent wishes to offend
no one, and if you should see your name
in these items be assured no offense was
intended.
Asa Hoit made a trip to Cramer this
week for Martin Jacobson, who is in the
mercantile trade at Hovland. The
good King Asa, in addition to being an
expert with the "ribbons", is not afraid
to ply the snow shovel (bis wife having
given him lessons at home during the
past winter), therefore there
is no anxiety
for his safety on our part.
The regular monthly meeting of the
Farmers' club will be held March 11th,
at thasohool
house which oervesMthe
community center. An interesting pro­
gram has been carefully prepared. A
two act comedy entitled, "Early Vows"
will be the most interesting feature. A
charge for admission of only 20 cents for
adults 5 cents for children will be made.
All revenue collected to be property of
club. A large crowd is expected
Everyone urged to boost by being pre­
sent.
Mr. Chas. Ebb, who has been working
in a logging camp, is now paying his
homestead a visit. He is one of our
most enterprizing young bachelors, hav­
ing built up a thriving farm adorned
with farm buildings that area credit to
the Reservation. He has now under
construction a spacious barn that iB,

perhaps, the greatest piece of architec­
ture in this part of the county. This
structure is of his own design and under
the supervision of himself. Just as
Khufer, the renowned pyramid builder
of Egypt, erected a wonder to the world,
so will Ebb to these "diggins".
Perhaps, the moss pressing need of
the Reservation to-day is a store in our
midst. Families are almost shut off
from supplies. The mail order houses
being about the only resort. There are
now between 35 and 40 settlers not in­
cluding our brothers of the red race, be­
sides there is a bright outlook for a ra­
pid increase. The business enterprises
bring large numbers of workmen within
our limits which would greatly add to
the trade. No -doubt, here is a great
opening for a wide-awake man with a
small capital.
We cannot overestimate the value of
our local paoer and it is the duty of
every settler in our community to rally
to
its
support by subscribing for it
and
using its columns for advertisement pur­
poses. It is to the county what Aaron
was to Moses—a spokesman. No coun­
ty is complete without a local paper.
We communicate our feelings, ideas,
thoughts and sentiments to one another
through its pages, it brings the differ­
ent parts of the county together and
they in turn learn and profit from each
other through it. Cooperation is made
available by it, therefore, every home
should receive the News-Herald.
The most agitating question of this
hamlet at present is that of "Prepared­
ness" which is now the pennant that
floats over the White House having ta­
ken the plaoe of the watchful waiting
policy flag. Our sages seem to differ on
this all important issue. Arthur Saylor,
our greatest politician, says that to
maintain this vast armament is to dis­
card the doctrine of our forefathers.
"There is a God who presides over the
destinies of nations" and to accept the
pagan expression, "God is on the side of
heaviest artillery." Be this as it may
we feel tbat it is suffice to say that those
who have been entrusted with the duties
of our government will do nothing rash
or that is not best for us as a Christian
nation.
The FarraerB1 G!ub of this community
met Saturday evening, February 12tb,
with Wm. Taylor presiding. Public
questions were cussed and disoussed,
but the meeting adjourned leaving the
telephone question open. About twenty
five persons were in attendance, which
is by no means a small gathering for this
place. This club means much to the
building of our community. It serves
as a center where the people are given
an opportunity to laugh and forget
trains the young people in parlimentary
law, oratory and elocution, deals with
questions of common interest, awakes
the masses to a state of action for the
good and benefit of all and developes
ideals of brotherhood kindness and
sympathy.
