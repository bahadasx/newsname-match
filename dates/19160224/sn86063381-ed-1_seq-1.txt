UNIQUE CASE RAISED
MANY UNUSUAL POINTS
Case Expected to Go to the Supreme
Court Scmtchin is
Attorney.
Judge B. F. Wright is in Bemidji
today holding a special session of
court in the court chambers at the
court house in the case of Julia
Morehouse of Melrose, Minn against
Robert Nelson of this city for the
recovery of two-thirds of the Nelson
estate which is valued at about $12,-
000 as the portion due the nine-year
old child which was adopted by Mrs.
Morehouse's daughter from Mrs. Nel
son in 1907.
Attorneys Donohue & Stevens are
representing Mrs. Morehpuse and
Attorney Charles W. Scrutchin is
acting for Mrs. Nelson.
Very Unique.
The case is very unique and pre
sents unprecedented features It is
expected to go to the supreme court
no matter which way it is decided
Attorney Scrutchin explains the
case as follows:
An illegitimate child was born to
Myrtle Ferguson who later married
Robert Nelson, a Bemidji liquor deal
er. Before her marriage Miss Fer
guson consented to the adoption of
the child by Mr. and Mrs John
McDonald. In 1910 Miss Ferguson
decided that she wanted the child
back and instituted proceedings to
retain legal possession of the child
and during the time the proceed
ings were in court she married Mr.
Nelson. The writ was denied, the
court holding that the child had been
legally adopted.
Foster Parents Die.
Since that time both the foster
parents have died and Mrs. Julia
Morehouse, mother of Mrs. McDonald,
now has care of the child.
When Mr. Nelson died, Mrs. More
house began action to obtain two
thirds of the estate on the ground
that it is due the child.
