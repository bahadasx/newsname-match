WASHINGTON ADMITS MOST
SERIOUS PROBLEM FACES
'ESPERATE ONSLAUGHT BY
GERMANS NOW IN PROGRESS

Gore Introduces a Resolution
Keep Americans off Ships
of Belligerants
(By Ataociated Preia.)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24. The first attempt to Introduce legis
lation warning Americans off armed belligerent ships was made in
congress today by Senator Gore, a Democrat. It was blocked
by Senator Brandegee, a Republican, and under the rules cannot be
resumed until tomorrow. Gore sought to Introduce his bill to pro
hibit the passage of Americans on such ships, also to introduce a
concurrant resolution requiring passage by the house, but unlike his
bill, It did not have the approval of the president. Gore made this
statement: "It seems to me the ship of state is drifting or driving
headlong upon the breakers."
Situation Most Serious
The Gore resolution seeks to
remove any cause for war injury
of any American of an armed bel-
llgerent ship. Agitation for ac-
tlon warning Americans off arm-
ed ships overshadowed all other
questions. The president's sup-
porters, apprehensive that the
smouldlng sentiment might blaze
up and embarrass diplomatic ne-
gotiatlons with Germany, is work-
ing to hold the administration
forces In line.' The Republicans
are generally opposed to action
by congress. The president Is
represented as determined to
maintain the right of Americans
to travel on armed merchantmen.
A senator In the confidence of
the White
HoiiRe Is quoted as '
saying that he thought the situa-
tlon the most serious since the
war started.
