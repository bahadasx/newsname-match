KO SUFFERING IN MEX-
I ICO THIS WINTER.
I THE Mexico Ledger wants to cora-
iliment those who worked so intclll
ently in the management ' of the
Iger's Good Fellow Fund foe the
diet of the poor of Mexico during the
outer. The various committees were
irompt and worked in an unselfish
av. and Citv Clerk Wallace Dear-
jug should have especial thanks for
he untiring work he did in investiga-
ng and seeing that none were al-
wed to suffer. The people of Mex-
with very few exceptions now
vor organized charity, and we do
iot believe that next year there will
e sny attempt to discredit or under
line this movement. s
The contributions made to this fund
frere handled without a dollar's ex
pense and there was not a single case
if suffering in Mexico that was not
iromptly investigated and relieved.

NEGRO MURDERER
"SONNY BOY" MITCHELL, WHO
KILLED "BUSTER" HAYES
HERE OCTOBER SEVEN
TEENTH 1903, CAP
TURED. WOUNDED 3 OTHERS
ADMITTED HIS IDENTITY TO OF.
' FICERS AT BLOOMINGTON,
ILL., WHEN PLACED UN
DER ARREST.
HAD SHOT HIS SISTER
a reward of $500 had been
offered for his appre
hension at the
time of the
crime. , ,
Augustus Mitchell, better known as
"Sonny Boy," a local aegro bully who
shot and killed "Buster" Hayes and
wounded three others, one his sister,
in this city the night of October sev
enteenth, 1903, wss placed under ar
rest by the officers in Blooming ton,
III, Saturday after thirteen year,
liberty. He admitted his identity and
consented to return to Mexico with
out extradition proceedings. "Sonny
Boy" left this city after the shooting
and though repeatedly reported cap
tured succeeded in evading arrest all
these years. At the time of the
shooting there was a reward of $500
for his capture but it is understood
this has since been withdrawn.
Mitchell has been living in Bloom
ington for the past seven years un
der the name of Smith and working
as a chef, his occupation while a res
ident here. Sheriff Barnett went t
Bloomington Saturday night and
brought Mitchell here Sunday.
Sheriff Barnett would not state
who had turned in Mitchell's where
abouts to the officer though it is
thought it was a relative of Hayes.
Mr. Barnett says Mitchell had been
known to be in Bloomington for a
number of years though no effort had
been made to comprehend him. The
reward for his capture expired about
ten years ago though it was renewed
twice. ,
Waves Preliminary Hearing.-'
"Sonny Boy" when he was arraign
ed before Squire Wayne Monday
morning waved the preliminary
hearing. His case will be set for the
March term of the Circuit Court
Until that time .he will be held at the
county jail. Prosecuting Attorney
Whitson read the charge of murder
on which "Sunny Boy" is held.
Mitchell spoke up without hesitancy
and said that he killed Hayes In
self-defense after being knocked
down the old "runway" at the Fox
building three times. .
He left here on the night of the
killing via a Wabash freight train to
St. Louis. From there he went to
New Orleans and Jacksonville, Fla,
where he stayed for three months.
Not wanting to stay at one place
too long so soon after the shooting
he left there for Texas where he lived
for sometime. But "Sonny Boy" just
had to come back to some of his old
haunts. He said he had lived in
Bloomington for nine years and had
a good home at the time of his ar
rest For months the "cops" in his dis
trict in Bloomington ate their mid
night lunch in the restaurant in which
Mitchell worked. He knew them well
and when they asked him his former
home it was the last of his thoughts
that they wanted him for the killing
of Hayes which long ago had ceased
to worry him. """
At the time pi the-shooting he was
only seventeen years, old and now
looks about 25 although he Is thirty.
He was well dressed and his general
appearance indicates that he has
been prospering. -. ' '
Btory oi crime. V-'.vs
me ioiiowing siry,.u$ uiw-mi
with which Mitchell: is charged is
taken from the Mexico Ledger under
date of Thursday Oct 22, 1903:
v Armed and looking for trouble,
Augustus Mitchel, a local negro char
acter commonly known as "Sonny
Boy" visited a negro dance hall, at
the corner of Jefferson and Liberty
streets, Saturday night the seven
teenth, on being refused admission a
quarrell ensued between himself and
the dance hall door-keepers, Jim
Hayes, well known as "Buster" and
Ben Phillips. Mitchell resorted to
his pistol, firing point blank at his
victims. Hays was shot in the right
breast dying twenty minutet later.
Phillips received a bullet which en
tered just in front of the right tem
ple and came out the right corner of
hit right eye, a glancing shot Mit
chell"was shooting through the door
or entrance to the crowded dance
room and among the dancers that
came in range of his bullets was Ree
Mitchell, a sister of the murderer
and George Gardner, of Moberly.
The Mitchell woman was shot in the
right tide the bullet ranging around
the fifth rib and coming out at the
left side. A bullet entered Gardner's,
right arm penetrating the muscle.
The dance was held in the second
floor of the building fromerly occu
pied by Haskell & Son carriage shops
and had been conducted each night
during carnival week by Hayes, Phil
lips, Babe Wright and Jim Rodgers.
Naturally some trouble had occurred
during the week and Mitchell had
ARRESTED - :
. AFTER THIRTEEN YEARS
been ejected with several others on a
previous night It is did that on
this occasion he tried to secure a
pistol with which "to clean up the
push" that had excited his anger, but
was unsuccessful in securing one un
til Saturday afternoon about four
o'clock, wheu ho rented a 38 calibre
from Mason Creasey. Armed with
this, he visited the dance hall about
ten o'clock. Mitchell made the re
mark to a number of yoiffti negroes
outside the dine hall, "I'm going
into this dance Without paying a
cent" v -.
Mitchell is employed in the Ringo
Hotel kitchen, bears a reputation as
a burly and a very bad character.
Hayes, the unfortunate victim, was
well known here and bore a good re
putation. Phillips is also a boy of
good manners. Gardner, who hails
from Moberly, was formerly in the
employe of Andy Caplinger, of that
city. He returned to his home in
Moberly after Drs. Crawford, Var-
non and Baskett had dressed his
wound.
.A Later Report
'Sunny Boy" Mitchell it still a fu
gitive from justice and teems to be
losing no time in creating a distance
between himself land Mexico. He
was recognized at Roodhouse by a
train porter who knew him and sgain
at Jacksonville. .1
PLAN CHILD WELFARE WEEK.
The Mexico Federation of Women's
Clubs will hold its regular monthly
meeting at the library on Monday af
ternoon at three o'clock. The board
will meet at two-thirty, and the mem
bers are urged to be present promptly
on time.
In the future the Federation' will
hold monthly meetings, instead of bi
monthly ones, on the regular Feder
ation day, the third Monday of each
month, and it is hoped that the third
Monday of each month will be set
aside by every club woman in Mexico
for the exclusive use of the Feder
ation. Child Welfare Week, March 4 to 11,
will be observed by the Federation
and an extensive .program is being
planned, with features which are both
interesting and instructive in nature.
On Saturday, March fourth, the Boy
Scouts will place flags over the doors
of homes. - '
On Sunday, March fifth, babies are
to be enrplled in Sunday School and
Christened at the Church services.
The ministers of the town will preach
on the theme, "Life, the Unasked-for
Gift, is Precious."
On Monday, there will be motion
pictures at the picture-show houses,
which will be of an educational value
to children. , i
On successive days will be pro
grams furnished by the Mothers and
Others Clubs and the social service
committee, with talks on topics of in
terest and value to mothers on child
welfare and community reform, by
speakers from out of town, probably
Dr. Pyle and Mist Stanley of Mis
souri University and a deaconess from
Kingdom House, St Louis.
One day will be devoted to domestic
science, and there will be prizes for
children in ' contests such as bread
making, garment making, crocheting,
and other things children can do.
Complete details for the week have
not as yet been arranged, but it is
quite certain that topics of great
value to mothers and children and the
community generally will be pre
sented. ' a
It is to be distinctly understood that
these programs are to be given for the
benefit of all the women and children
of the town, not merely for the club
women. Thy . are taking charge of
tha- arrangements, but every woman
in Mexico is urged to co-operate with
those in charge, and it it hoped every
woman and child in town will partici
pate in some way in the meetings.

Live Audrain Community Expects to
, Vote on Question Shortly Mat
ters is Being Agitated.
MEETINGS HELD LAST WEEK
Eolia, Pike County, Has Met With
Splendid Success ia Their Con- '
solidated High SchooU
Mr. Clayton, of Jefferson City, upon
invitation, was in Benton City last
Friday and Saturday and discussed
the consolidated High School question.
Benton City expects to vote on this
matter shortly. Friday evening he
spoke to the Literary Society in the
evening and Saturday afternoon ad
dressed a meeting of citizens. A con
solidated high school would be a splen
did improvement for Benton City.
This School Satisfies.
Eolia, a little town in the southern
part of Pike county, Missouri, with a
population of 343, decided in the fall
of 1912 to give the children of that
place the advantage of some high
school training. One room was built
on to the regular school building and
the first year of high school work was
offered, no students being ready for
the second year's work. From that
time on, each year they have added
one more year of high school work to
their curriculum and now the children
of Eolia are enjoying the advantage
of a first class high school.
The rapid growth of this school in
such a small town is due to the re
markable school spirit of all the lead
ing business men and patrons who
have been at all times ready to act on
a good suggestion and to make sacri
fices to boost the school; to the untir
ing efforts, the discreet judgment and
the remarkable ability of their leader,
Prof. Sterling Thompson of La Belle,
Missouri, who has been with them
from the beginning. It was through
his efforts chiefly that the extraordi
nary advances were attempted and ac
complished. And last, the growth is
due to the advantages of a superior
school. The assessed valuation is
large enough so that with a small in
crease in taxes the amount is suffi
cient to do things.
Objections Disappeared:
A few of the farmers at first object
ed because they were afraid of high
taxes. But in spite of their fears most
of them lined up right at the polls and
when they voted on the proposition in
the spring of 1914 it carried 147 to 23.
Since they have seen the advantages
of the superior school facilities and
know how little extra it cost them in
the way of taxes the opposition has
died out entirely with the exception
of two large tax-payers without chil
dren who are "opposed to any system
of free public schools just as strenu
ously as they are to this school.
The taxes required are 75 cents on
the hundred dollars, an increase of 10
cents on the hundred to most of the
tax-payers. This supports the full
four year high school, the eight grade
teacherB, and the rural schools in ad
dition. The high school is practically
self-sustaining. That is, the tuition
of the non-resident pupils added to
the regular state money (about $5.50
per pupil) plus the $800 special state
aid pays the entire expense of the
high school so the high school advan
tages for their children are costing
them nothing.
The rural schools are kept running
just as they were before, leaving a
school close for the little ones and
after they have completed the eighth
grades they come to the central high
school free of tuition.
The central, building is a modern
structure of nine rooms besides the
library, laboratories and cloak rooms.
It is heated by steam, has all mod
ern conveniences, five acres of play
groana including three basket ball
courts, three tennfi) courts and a base
balFdlaimond. On- the ground is a
stable- for" the .accomodation of the
countrv children who ride or drive in;
over 20 horses are kept in this'iarri.
One of the arguments used against
t&4 school was that it was a-scheme
of the town people to work the farm
ers.- for a ni-w., school building, A
glance at the present enrollment will
discredit this. Over half the pupils
enrolled are from the country and the
per cent of country children entering
high school is continually increasing,
Of the 23 pupils in the freshman class
this year, 18 are from the country.
The country boys and girls of this
community have been given opportun
ities equal to those-of the boys and
girls living in our larger towns.
As for the ability of country boys
and girls as compared with those liv
ing in the larger towns we need only
to look up their record. First, these
Eolia High School students have suc
ceeded ''in keeping their school im
proving each year, moving up one
class each year ,and now standing as
a first-class high school approved by
the State Department of Education,
In tha three debates which they have
had with the adjoining first-class high
schools located in towns from 2,000 to
5,000 inhabitants, they have won two
of them and lost one.
The Eolia people are all of one
voice when it comes to proclaiming
their central high school as the real
solution of the Country problem. It
has been given a fair trial and proven
a success in every way.

AGENTS ORGANIZE HERE.
The real estate agents of Mexico,
for the matter of self protection, have
banded together and issued a list of
house renters who do not pay. In the
future when the renters who has va
cated a house without settling tries
to rent another residence he will find
if cannot be done.
The practice of renting houses and
then moving from them owing for
several months hat become, in many
instances, a habit The agents are to
be congratulated upon this plan of
co-operation. It might be followed
with advantage by those who do a
credit retail business in the city.
