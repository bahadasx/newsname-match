EX-GOV. GILCHRIST
VISITS MIAMI
Campaigning for United Senator
Discusses the Contest with
a Newspaper Reporter
Hon. Albert W. Gilchrist, form
er governor of Florida, candidate
for United States senator, and
owner of two hats his own and
grandpa's' arrived in Miami
Thursday, night spent yesterday
and last night in hand-to-hand
communion with the voting popu-
lation. and will remain here ac
cording to his calculations, until
Mondav when he will leave for
points south of here.
. The hat worn by Mr. Gilchrist
is me one ne laceuuusiy cano mo
own. It is photographed on some
of the campaign literature which
he is distributing. Another hat,
of the"plug"variety, the "grand
pa hat," also appears in promi
nent relief on the literature, and
looks as though it might be in
tended for a cast net to gather in
the votes of Presbyterians,. Bap
tists, Methodists and those of all
the religious faiths, for just such
hats were worn by the forcfath-
rs of all church devotees now in
the country.
. Incidentally it is interesting to
hear from Mr. Gilchrist that he
; thinks they are coming his way,
and that the race for United
States senator is between himself
and Messrs. Bryan and Trammell.
mi f -m, "
ine lormer governor nas, in
this trip, visited the entire Btate
' except five or six counties, all the
way down from the Alabama line.
, His methods are distinctively his
own, the same as those which ele
vated him to the gubernatorial
pinnacle a few years ago. He only
rides on trains between stations.
While in towns and cities he un
dertakes to meet every man face
to face, hand out his printed plat
form and become acquainted; Vir
tually, he is on a walking cam-
. paign, and it moans many hours a
day of hard work and little of
, ease. , "
"Why don't you let a boy dis
tribute your literature!" he was
asked yesterday. ,
"Simply because I want to
meet the people and take a look
at them," he replied. "When I
meet mem tney are anxious to!
read what I have written, and
when they do that I am reason
ably Rlirft thnv urn nnt rrnir,
oppose me."
Says it is Three-Cornered " :
"How does the campaign look
to you?" was asked by a repre
xentative of The Miami Herald.-
"You can judge from this," he
replied. "In any county in Flori
da the well-posted citizens will
tell you the race is between Gil
christ and Trammell or Gilchrist
and Bryan. This is a very satis
factory situation as I view it."
"Are you hearing much on the
prohibition question?"
"My opponents, Bryan and
Trammell, have come out for na
tional prohibition. I have stated.
and it is my platform, that which
ever way the state , votes on that
question, I will vote as a senator
in congress. Therefore the pro
hibitionists who are for me are
satisfied with my position, and
those who are opposed to me
would vote against me whether I
went the whole hog or not. The
prohibition vote of the state will
be divided between Bryan, Tram
mell and myself. Youjiave ask
d me some questions, now let me
ask you who do you think will
lead in. Pe.nsacola, Jacksonville,
St. Augustine, Palm Beach, Mi
ami, Key West and Tampa?"
The newspaper man did not re
ply, but it was evident that Mr.
Gilchrist had in mind someone
whose name begins with a G.
"In the smaller towns," he
said, "and in the country, I have
always won out, and will this
time. When I ran for governor I
received the majority vote in ev
ery county in Florida except
Sumter and Lee. I will carry
Lee county this time, but I don't
know about Sumter."
Mr. Gilchrist spoke of the Ev
erglades. "My opponent, Mr. Stockton,
promises Lee county to carry out
the drainage schemes under any
circumstances. I tell thorn that
a proposition of this kind, re
quiring the expenditure of mil
lions of dollars, is one of business
and not of politics, and that I will
act accordingly to my best judge
ment. My record in that respect
is known."
On this subject he added that a
Dill was introduced in congress
by John Sharp Williams and
Speaker Clark providing for the
expenditure of about fifteen mil
lions of dollars then held by the
government and derived from the
sales of Jands in the various
states. This bill provided for the
expenditure of this money in the
purchase of drainage bonds, the
government to sell Jhe bonds, buy
more bonds, and thus keep up an
endless chain of 'drainage bond
buying. "I will do my best to
see that measure enacted into
law," said Mr. Gilchrist.
The literature which he is dis
tributing personally contains
some racy reading, many side
lights on political matters, and is
worth perusal by those who want
information about the campaign
which is now getting to white
heat. Miami Herald, Feb. 12.

Plant Leguminous Crop for Citrus
Grove
There may bo plenty of nitro
gen in the soil for your citrus
trees now. But you may have a
different story to tell in eight
weeks. That is a habit nitrogen
has in these loose citrus soils. It
stays in just long enough for the
grower to decide that he will not
need to plant a cover crop. Readi
ly available nitrogen leaches rap
idly. Its availability depends on
its ready solubility. The supply
available for the plant may leach
from an open soil within eight
weeks. The trees show need of it
by yellowing. '
B. F . Floyd, plant physiologist
to the University of Florida Ex
periment Station, advises those
growers who intend to apply very
little or no fertilizer during the
summer to adopt some means of
supplying and maintaining the
ogen. Cultivation of legumi
nous cover crops is' the best meth
od. No matter whether the grow
er plans to fertilize or not he
should grow legumes in his grove.
Theyfurnish not onlynitrogenbut
humus and organic matter as well
which are necessary for the main
tenance of soil life. Wherever
conditions will permit, cover
crops should be planned before
planting time.
Cowpeas and boearar weed are
the favorites because they can be
grown quickly. Velvet beans are
fully as good as, if not better
than, either, but owing to their
rank growth they are apt to
smother the trees or interfere
with their growth otherwise. Seed
should be obtained for the cover
crop before planting time.
Th3 regular meeting of the Wo
man's Christian Temperance U
mon was held in the Baptist
church, Feb. 18th. After the bu.
mess was disposed of, Dr. Duke
gave an eloquent address, which
was of great benefit to all who
heard him.
The members of the Junior Ep
worth League of the Methodist
church, chaperoned by Mrs. J. II.
Hancock and Miss Dorothy Ras
mussen, had a joyous time, Satur
day, picknicking on the beach at
Capt. Bearce's place in Solana.
Whether vindicated in any of
his remaining conceptions of the
present war, Lord Kitchener cer
tainly had a fine eye for length.

Dixie Highway Off icial
Coming to Punta Gorda
: t
All Automobile Owners Urged to Join
Committee to Meet Him at
Shell Creek Bridge ;
It is earnestly desired and of great importance that every auto
mobile owner in this vicinity join the committee and go in his car to
meet Secretary, AY. S. Gilbreath of the Dixie Highway Association to
morrow afternoon. The people of this section should manifest all the
good roads enthusiasm possible on this occasion; and to be received
by a large number of citizens in automobiles as he comes to the city,
will no doubt make a favorable impression upon Mr. Gilbreath. Au
tomobiles should be in readiness to go at a moment's notice, as a tele
phone message will announce the departure of the party from Arca
dia, and the Punta Gorda party
-heu creek bridge or at Fort Ogden.
Plans are being made for entertaining Mr. Gilbreath at supper at
the Seminole hotel, when some twenty-five representative Punta Gor
dans will dine with him, and at 9 o'clock in Dixie Theatre there will
be a meeting for the discussion of the Dixie Highway project. This
meeting should be attended by every one. ' i
Either on Friday afternoon or on Saturday morning, Secretary
Gilbreath and party will go over that portion of the auxiliary Dixie
Highway route that leads south from this city to the Lee county line,
and it is hoped to have a number of
tive citizens accompany them.
As soon as it is known definitely as to what are the plans of Mr,
Gilbreath. it will be circulated about the city so that all may be in
formed who can take part in the functions on the occasion of his visit.
Let every citizen show his enthusiasm and help stress the fact
that Punta Gorda is for and wants the Dixie Highway to come this
way, and that the logical route is
Hon. W. V. Knott Holds Some
Sound Views
Hon. W. V. Knott, candidate
for governor, holds some sound
views on state' questions and in
his platform expresses himself on
one issue in terms that will meet
with the general approval of the
state press and the thinking pub
lic. Mr. Knott says: "Our exist
ing libel laws as applied to the
press, and interpreted by 'our
courts are too restrictive, and, un
der my prerogative as governor,
I shall urge upon the legislature
such amendments to and revision
of the libel laws as will give to the
press absolute liberty of publica
tion when made in the public in
terest and without malice."
Plant City Courier.
Mr. Knott has incorporated in
to his platform a plank which ap
peals very strongly to the news
paper people, of Florida, and we
trust that all his competitors in
the race will see, the point and a
dopt the same plank. He is tired
of the gross, flagrant injustice to
the newspapers of Honda in the
present tyrannous and restrictive
libel laws.' We suggest to
all the candidates for governor
that they step right up on the
plank in Candidate Knott's plat
form in which he pledges himself
to use his influence, if elected, to
secure a libel law for this state
that does not outrage every prin
ciple of justice and common sense,
as is tne case witn me present
one. As that law now is, it seems
designed to restrict the legitimate
rights of the newspaper in tha
spirit of pure tyranny and inci
dentally to" aid the damage suit
lawyer whose eagle eye is always
piercing the horizon in all direc
tions seeking for a chance to
scare up a damage suit. Lake
land Telegram.
Among the planks which go to
make up the platform of Hon. W.
V. Knott, is one which will doubt
less be met with satisfaction by
every newspaper publisher in the
state as well as by that vast num
ber of people who believe in tree
speech and an unmuzzled, press.
It is a fact that cannot be disput
ed that Florida's newspapers arc
muzzled as no other newspapers
in the United States, and that as
a result the papers are forced to
suppress much of the news and
happenings of the day that tne
public is justly entitled to and
has every reason to expect.
Under a recent decision of the
Supreme Court at Tallahassee,
the daily and weekly publications
are placed in a most peculiar and
unwarranted position. If there
should meet the, Arcadia party at
Punta Gorda cars and representa
through this city.
was ever need for a revision of
the libel laws of any State, that
need is in Florida today. One of
the first things that should be ta
ken up by the Legislature of next
year should be a revision of these
laws which now permit the crimi
nal, the fakir and forger and the
what-nots to pester and hamper
tho publication of a newspaper
with legitimate aims and pur
poses. Florida newspapers have
long ago realized this need; but
it was not until the recent decis
ion of the Supreme Court above
referred to, that this need was
driven into the minds of publish
ers and the public generally in a
forceful manner.
The Metropolis sincerely hopes
that every candidate for Govern
or will view the situation as does
Mr. Knott and that each and ev
ery one of them will declare them
selves on the subject of "freedom
of the press." No man who is not
in sympathy with laws which
would give the newspaper the
right to print "all the news that's
fit to print," should receive the
endorsement of Florida Demo
crats, for he would be in sympa
thy with suppressing one of the
guarantees of the federal consti
tution. The Florida Metropolis.
South Florida
There was a time when people
went to California quite indiffer
ently where they struck the State
at Shasta, San Francisco, or Los
Angeles. But all that is changed
now. No one ever goes to Cali
fornia any more, they just run
out to Los, Angeles. You can
meet a hundred men in a day who
have been out to the coast, and
when you ask them to locate their
place of visit it will be Los Ange
les in more than 90 per cent, of
the cases.
It likewise used to be that peo
ple came to Florida indifferently,
and it made but little difference
whether they stopped off at Jack
sonville or went to some other
point in the state. But all that
is changed now, and you can
stand in the depot at Jacksonville
and question the tourists as to
their destination, and more than
90 per cent, of them will answer,
"South Florida."
Now, there is a great big why
for all this in both States. Some
years ago a citrus fair was in op
eration m Los Angeles, and the
only ripe oranges displayed came
from the foothills above. Sacra
mento, and yet the people scurri
ed right by that section and stop
ped not till they had a bed hired
in a big Los Angeles hotel at a
fancy price. And the same .is
true here in Florida. Where can
there be found finer citrus fruit
than is grown at Crescent City,
and yet who knows a thing about
the place"? Where are there to be
had finer strawberries than all
produced in Bradford county,
and yet the prospective purchaser
of Florida berry land scoots right
through that section and hies him
self down to Plant City. And so
it is all the way through the cata
log. -.
But now for the why of it all.
It is simply publicity and promo
tion. In Los Angeles thousands
and thousands of dollars were in
vested in boom editions of the
city papers and sent broadcast all
ever the East. During the flood
tide of immigration which struck
California in 1878, the trains were
all unloaded at Sacramento and
San Francisco. When the next
boom of immigration struck the
State, not a man ever thought of
stopping north of Tehachipi. No
man would rest easy till he could
arise in the morning and feast
his eyes on Old Baldy.
In South Florida they have
wide-awake newspapers, boards
of trade, active business men, get-up-and-do
Rotary clubs, and all
that goes to make it worth while
for a man to come into the com
munity and invest his money and
help build up the country. They
have good roads and fine farms
and all that goes to make a com
munity prosperous and thrifty.

Start Saving Now for an Educa
tion Do you know a boy or girl whe
would like to have an education?
You do. There are several in ev
ery community. Perhaps you
have children who would like to
have an education or whom you
would like to send to school. Do
you know why more children do
not go to school? They have not
the necessary funds.
Why not begin saving now? If
you are like almost every man
you meet you cannot spare $200
to $400 a year to send your child
to college. But if you had start
ed saving fifteen years ago you
could have had the money and
you never weuld have missed the
small monthly savings. Plans are
under consideration at the Uni
versity of Florida for an educa
tional savings fund. A deposi
tory will be provided in one bank
in each county. The money will
be available to the child or per
son under whose name it is de
posited at the ag3 of twenty or
when the child is ready to go to
college. Persons will not be re
quired to attend the University
of Florida. It is probable that
banks will compound the interest
quarterly.
This plan will enable many par
ents to send their children to col
lege who would not be able to do
so otherwise. It will also pro
mote the habit of saving not only
in the parents but in the child as
well.

ALLIES BOMBARD
GERMANS
Reports from Western Battle
front Turkish Losses
Erzerum Air Rsiu
London, Eng. Reports " from
the western battlefront indicate
that the allies are bbmbarding
German positions south of Somme
where they also repulsed a strong
German attack. Tho French re
port also tells of destruction of a
German Zeppelin by French anti-air-craft
guns at Revigny.
The Petrograd official state
ment today announces that the
Turks' losses at Erzerum when
the Russians captured the string
of fortresses surrounding the city
amounted to 40,000 in killed,
wounded and prisoners.
The Germans report that every
attempt of the British to regain
recently lost ground in the. Yprea
sector has been repulsed.
Following up their victory en
ergetically, the Russians are pur
suing, the Turks westward from
Erzerum, as well as to the north
and the south, as tha Turkish
forces have split and fled in all
directions. The different Otto
man groups, according to Petro
grad advices, have been cut off
from communication with each
other, while the Russians are de
clared to have solidified their own
lines so that their advance is rap
idly becoming a forward drive a-
long an unbroken front from the
Black sea to Mush, west of Lake
Van.
On the north, Trebizond is
threatened, the Russians having;
pushed close to the Black sea port
in their operations ajong tho
Coast, while the Russian forces
from Erzerum are reported near-
mg the coast city. 11
Differences between Greece and .
the entente allies over military ?
questions appear to be in a wayi
to be smoothed out as the result
of a visit of General Sarrail, tho.
French commander in the Bal
kans, to King Constantino. The
king has expressed himself as
confident that tho interview
marked the first step toward tho
end of the difficulties.
The Austrians are continuing;
their air raids over Italian terri
tory. The latest flights were a
cross the province of Brescia, and
towards Milan. Some report four
persons killed and five wounded,
with very slight material damage.
In Petrograd, the, Russian duma
met Tuesday. It has not been in
session since ; last September,
when it was prorogued.
The British delegation to tho
Anglo-French parliamentary com
mittee began Tuesday its confer
ences in Paris with an equal num
ber of French senators and depu
ties, the object being full discus
sion of the conduct of the war
with a view to the guidance of
the parliaments of the two na
tions. A communication published in
last week's HERALD calls at
tention to a lesson that ' Punta
Gorda may learn from New York
in the matter of sewer connection
on the streets that are to be pav
ed with asphalt; The point is
that the connections should bo
made, at least sewer pipes should
be laid from the main, sewers to
the property lines, before the
streets are paved to avoid .having;
the paving torn up afterwards. A
member of the city council advis
es that an ordinance will proba
bly be enacted assessing a penal
ty of at least $25 in every case
where the asphalt is torn up for
such connections or other pur
poses after the streets are paved.
