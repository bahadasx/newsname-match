" ou must know that an officer of
tlie law is always subjected to much
criticism. He is (please pardon the
expression) damned if he does and
damned if ho doesn't. Political ene

"I do not fear the outcome because
I belli vu in the triumph of right and

In tho opinion of Circuit Clerk J.
E. Boggs, Baldridge will have to re
main in the county jail until his case
is finally disposed of.
"The whole situation is a develop
ment of the bond surrender," said Mr.
Bogas "HaJ his attorneys foreseen
such a surrender, undoubtedly prelim
inary c:idenre would have been giv

have furnished testimony which could
now be used by Circuit Court offi
cials in deciding whether or not the
case is bailable. As it is, all hands
are tied. There is no evidence, It Is
too late to obtain it, and there Is-noth-ing
to do but wait. This Is the law
as I see it."

A FLAG FOR EYEKT BABY
Patriotic fllsplav Will Be Made for '
Columbia's Litllc Ones.
That Columbia's babies are first in
the hearts of her citizens is proved by
the plans now being made for the post

doorstep. Next Monday has been se
lected as Flag Day. Whether or not
any flags will remain up after Monday
will be left to the discretion of Every
Baby's family. No babies under 3
years of age are to be neglected. At
houses where there are twins there
will be two flags, of course there will
be a Hag for every baby. Black or
white, the baby will get his flag just
the same.
Flags for babies living on the north
side of Broadway will be delivered
Monday morning by the Boy Scouts.
Flags for the south side will be de
livered by the Campfire Girls. Over
400 flags have been ordered from Chi
cago for the occasion.
