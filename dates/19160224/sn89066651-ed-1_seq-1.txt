SCHOOL NOTES.
BW. H JOHNSON, Supmir.tor.dont
Our average attendance is now
the largest the school has ever
had. This speaks well, for the
interest parents are taking in
the work. I lis very gratifying
to teachers to sue the parents
taking the interest they are in
the school generally. Remem
ber, you have struck the key
note towards making the school
a success when you .send your
children to school regularly.
Keep it up.
Miss Pickens visited home
folks at Cape Girardeau Sunday.
Our boys and girls went to
Kennett last Friday, where they
played two games of basket ball
with tho teams of that school.
Hayti teams won both games,
the boys by a score of 13 !50:
the girls by" the decisive score of
21 '.. The boys and girls speak,
very highly ol the good treat?
ment they received at Kennett.-,
The solid geometry class has,
completed the course in that
subject and is now

The progress in penmanship is
very satisfactory. We are using
the Ransomerian system, a form
of the old Spencerian system. A
marked improvement is no
ticeable in the writing done by
the children.
.The 12th grade das in En-'
glish has lini-lied a study of
Canterbury Tales. They will
take up King Lear next.
The ninth grade class in En
glish is studying "Lady of the

I The Virgil class began Book

ball team' will play our boys,
another undefeated team, on our
court Friday night.

Prices Again Go Soaring.
. Notice comes again this week
notifying us that on account of
the increasing scarcity of raw
materials, the mills have been
forced to make another advance
in prices. Practically all grades
of paper are affected. And this
new raise calls for a 0o increase
in tho price for printers to pay.
As much as the Herald regrets
to say, we are therefore bound
to raise our price in our job and
i advertising departments. This
j week we aio publishing our new
'advertising rates, which will
I take effect t lie first of March,
j 1010. Of course we cannot, be
lieve the public will blame us for
it. it's only natural that we
must charge more when we have
to pay more. The merchants do
it, and yon would, too, Prac
tically everything has advanced
except printers' prices, and sev
eral papers over this part of the
country are doing likewise; this
necessitates a change with us,
We hope our patrons will appro
ciatoour position, as wo have uo
other alternative.

BOB CROW RETURNS.
R. G. (Bob) Crow, former post
master at Caruthorsville, and
who disappeared while regis
tered at tho Pontine hotel in St.
Louis, December 21, 1914", and of
which comment has been made,
returned home Tuesday morning.
When he stepped oil" the train
he said to his friends: "You can't
keep a good man down."
Further than this he has little'
to say. Asked if he cared tomtike'tOR ,,,n''( ,l KepubliciiH iiio.t..miy nl,,llt.
a statement as to why he disap
peared he said: "No, I prefer not
to talk about that: I am well and
happy, and if ever I leave home
again I will have to be carried off
by force."
His wife and children gave him
a warm welcome. Crow is '.',i
years old and the picture of
health. His skin
caused, he says,
is bronzed. '
from his stuv
on salt water.
Regarding his whereabouts,
and all else but the cause of his
absence, he talks freely. He said
he had been in the United States
Marino service, known as tho 0th
mine laying corps, stationed in
Boston harbor. He left there,
he states, last Monday and came
direct to his home at druthers
ville, where he has a wife and
two children. j
I He said his wife had known of
his whereabouts for some time,
jand knew that he was to return
as soon as Ins release could be
secured from naval service.
i
Bob is a brother of C. A. C''ow
formerly congiessman of the
lth district. ;
At the time of his disappear;
ance he represented the New
York Life Insurance Company i
in Southeast Missouri. He left I
home December 18, 1014, going
to St. Louis, he said, to make
annua! settlement with the com
pany. A letter his wife received
stating that he was buying
Christmas presents for his chil
dren was the last heard of him.
It was known that he had more
than one thousand dollars on his
person.
December '21 all his clothing,
suit case and papers were found
in his room at the Pontine hotel,
and for several weeks the de
tectives carched without avail
for his whereabouts. Not a
trace of the missing man could
no louno, ano ioui piny was sus
pected. On the same day of his disap
pearance Mrs. Bessie Halliday,
i divorced woman with whom he
had been ncquaii.t(, put in her
.ippean nee at the hotel and in
quired for Crow. The St. Louis
police, suspecting the woman
unow something of why the
man was missing, arrested her
and the bell boy at tho hotel,
Out i hey were soon released,
Crow's wife was persistent in
her belief that her husband had
bean murdered and his body
made away with, and refused to
believe the stories about the
other woman. So firmly was
she convinced of her husband's
death Mrs. Crow filed a claim
against the National Life Insur.
auco Company of Vermont, in
which he held policies, Not be
lieving that Urow was dead,
the insurance company b,egan a
systematic search for thu miss,
ing man, reporting last Juno
that ho had been found, but for
some reason refused to make
known his whereabouts until
Crow himself decided to return
of his own free will to his family
and friends,
And thus, tho mystery, what-
ever it was, that caused Crow's
absence, remains unsolved.

To worry about the past is to dig up a
grave. Let the corpse lie.
To worry about the future is to dig your
own grave. Let the undertaker attend
to that. ,. . - .... ..
