INTERNAL REVENUE OF
LOWER MANHATTAN ISLAND.
Collections for Year Ending June 30
Were Over $35,000,000.
New York, Feb. 23. John Z. Lowe,
Jr., internal revenue collector of the
district comprising the lower part of
Manhattan Island, estimated today that
the internal revenue tax collections
from that district for the year ending
June 30 would amount to $35,000,000,
possibly $40,000,000. The collections in
that district in 1915 were $26,000,000,
or 6 1-3 per cent, of the total internal
revenue receipts of the United States,
which amounted to $415,869,875. These
collections include the corporation and
individual income taxes and the war
tax collections under the emergency
act. The amount annually collected
from this district exceeds the aggre
gate collected from 31 states.
Mr. Lowe attributes the prospective
increase of upwards of $9,000,000 in the
collections from this district to new
bond issues of .corporations, transfers
and the effect of the emergency act.
He regards the increase as a reliable
barometer of business prosperity.

OFF ARMED SHIPS.
Agitation in Congress Has Suddenly
Grown to Great Proportions.
Washington, Feb. 23. Agitation in
congress for action warning Americans
off armed ships of the European bel
ligerents suddenly grew to such pro
portions today that the democrats of
the foreign affairs committee voted to
canvass the sentiment of the house on
several pending resolutions.
Sentiment in the Senate in favor of
such action also was openly expressed,
but at the end of a day of surprises,
tension and agitation such as has not
been seen in congress in some time,
the word came that President Wilson
still was unalterably opposed to any
such action by congress and believed
that he would only be embarrassed
thereby in the negotiations with Ger
many. To widely circulated suggestions
that the situation had reached a point
where the president soon would lay it
before congress, that Secretary Lan
sing might in some way define the at
titude of the government in a com
munication to Senator Stone, and that
a time had been fixed within which the
United States would expect Germany
to signify her intention to abandon the
announced intention to sink armed
merchant ships without warning, the
uniform statement was made officially
that nothing had been determined
upon: that the situation though grave
still was a waiting one, and that no
final position would be announced un
til Berlin was heard from.
The sudden developments at the
capitol brought surprise and appre
hension to the administration leaders.
While confronted with the possibility
of congressional interference, with all
its grave aspects resulting from a de
fection from the administration policy
to downright embarrassment of the
president and the secretary of state,
the leaders were confident they would
control the situation and leave the ex
ecutive branch of the government free
to carry on diplomatic negotiations
with Germany.
