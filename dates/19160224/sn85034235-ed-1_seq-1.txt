SYNOPSIS.
Wild Water wants eggs for Miss Arral.
He agrees to pay $10 per egg if two dozen

By a clever ruse Wild Water unloads
bad eggs on Smoke and Shorty and they
lose 517,000. They are captured by In
dians.

Captured by Indians.

sleeping robe, examined the
feet of a dog he had rolled,
snarling, on its back in the

"We've got to rest over tomorrow
and make moccasins," he vouchsafed.
"That little crust is playing the devil
with their feet"
"We ougbta keep goin' somehow,"

cooked a meal for two and liegan to
look for Shorty's return. An hour »at

er he strapped on his snowshoes and
went out on his partner's trail.
The way led up the bed of the stream
through a narrow gorge that widened
suddenly into a moose pasture. But no
moose had been there since the first
snow of the preceding fall. The tracks |
of Shorty's snowshoes crossed the pas
ture and went up the easy slope of a
low divide. At the crest Smoke halted.
The tracks continued down the other

tniler and heavier than the Indians of
the Yukon basin. Five of them carried
the old fashioned, long barreled Hud
son Bay company musket, and in the
hands of the sixth was a Winchester
ritle which Smoke knew to be Shorty's.
Nor did they waste time in making
him a prisoner. Unarmed himself.
Smoke could only submit. The contents
of the sled were distributed among
their own packs, and he was given a
pack composed of his and Shorty's
sleeping furs. The dogs were nnhar

of the Indians by signs indicated a
trail too rough for sled travel. Smoke
bowed to the inevitable, cached the
sled end on in the snow on the bank

which had been occupied for several
days. Here was cached a quantity of
dried salmon and a sort of pemmican,
which the Indians added to their packs.
From this camp a trail of many snow
shoes led off—Shorty's captors, was
Smoke's conclusion—and before dark
ness fell he succeeded in making oat
the tracks Shorty's narrower snowshoes
had left
Always In the days that followed
they pointed north, and always the
trail, turning and twisting through a
jumble of upstanding peaks, trended
north.
In six days they gained and crossed
the central pass, low In comparison
with the mountains It threaded, yet
formidable In Itself and not possible
for loaded sleds. Five days more of
tortuous winding, from lower altitude
to lower altitude, brought them to the
open, rolling and merely hilly country
La Perle had fouud ten years before.
Smoke knew It with the first glimpse.
Far as he could see rolled the open
country. High in the east the Rockies
still thrust their snowy ramparts heav
enward. To the south and west ex
tended the broken ranges of the pro
jecting spur system they had crossed.
And in this vast pocket lay the cotin
try La Perle had traversed—snow
blanketed, but assuredly fat with game
at some time in the year and In the
summer a smiling, forested and flow
ered land.
Before fnidday, traveling down a
broad stream, they came upon the site
of a large camp, recently abandoned
Glancing as he went by It, Smoke es
timated 400 or 500 fires and guessed
the population to be In the thousands.
So fresh was the trail and so well
packed by the multitude that Smoke
and his captors took off their snow
shoes and In their moccasins struck a
swifter pace.
In the long twilight no sign was man
ifested of making camp. They held
steadily on through a deepening gloom
that vanished under a sky of light
great glittering stars, half veiled by a
greenish vapor of pulsing aurora bore
alis. His dogs first caught the noises
of the camp, pricking their ears and
whining In low eagerness. Then it
came to the ears of the humans
murmur dim with distance.
The men about him quickened. The
legs that had lifted through a dozen
strenuous hours lifted In a still swifter
pace that was half a run and mostly
a running jog. Through a dark spruce
flat they burst upon an abrupt glare of
light from many fires and upon an
abrupt increase of sound. The great
camp lay before them.
An d as they entered and threaded
the Irregular runways of the hunting
camp a vast tumult as in a wave rose
I to meet them and rolled on- with them
[ —cries, greetings, questions and an
s wers, Jokes and jokes thrust back
again, the snapping snarl of wolf dogs,
the scolding of squaws, laughter, the
whimpering of children and wailing of
infants, all the pandemonium or a
camp of nerveless, primitive wilder
ness folk.
They halted In the trampled snow by
an open fire, where Shorty and two
young Indians, squatted on their hams,
were broiling strips of caribou meat.
Three other young Indians, lying In
furs on a mat of spruce bows, sat up.
Shorty looked across the fire at his
partner, but with a sternly Impassive
| face, like those of his companions.

meat.
What's the matter?" Smoke de

The old familiar grin twisted on
I shorty's face. "Nope." he answered.

"Next day after yon left."
"Hum! Well, I'm doin' fine, thank

down with a squaw. Got two kids ai
ready, but he'll skin out if ever the
chance opens up."
Apparently this was Smoke's ap
pointed domicile, for his captors left
him and his dogs and went on deeper
into the big camp. While he devoured
| strips of hot meat Shorty talked,

"Here comes Whiskers, lookin' like
he's goin' somewhere," Shorty whis
pered.
It was iporning. and the bachelors
were squatting over a breakfast of
caribou meat Smoke glanced up and
saw a small and slender man, skin
clad like any savage, put unmistaka
bly white, striding In ndVance of a sled
team and a following of a dozen In
dians. Bushy whiskers, yellowish gray
and stained by camp stroke, concealed
most of the face, but failed wholly to
conceal the gaunt almost cadaverous,
cheeks.
How do you do?" the man said,
slipping a mitten and holding out his
bare hand. "My name ts Snass."
Mine's Bellew," Smoke returned,
feeling peculiarly disconcerted as he
gazed into the keen, sèarchlng black
eyes.
"Getting plenty to,cat 1 see. Rough
rations, but we don't starve often. And
it's more natural than the hand reared
meat of the cities."
"1 see you don't like the cities."
Smoke laughed In order to be saying
something and was immediately star
tled by the transformation Snass un
derwent. <|
Quite like a sensitive plant the man'«
entire form seemed to wilt and quiver.
Then the recoil, tense and savage, con
centered in the eyes. In which appeared
a hatred that screamed of lmmeasur
able pain. He turned abruptly away
and then, recollecting himself, remark
ed casually over his shoulder:
"I'll see yon later. Sir. Bellew. The
caribou are moving east« and I'm going
ahead to pick ont a location. You'll all
come on tomorrow."
Later on in the morning Smoke went
for a stroil through tf>e camp, busy
with its primitive pursuits. A big body
of hunters bad just returned, aud the
men were scattering tq their varions
(ires Women and children were de
parting with dogs harnessed tq empty
toboggan sleds, and women and chil
dren and flogs were hauling sleds
heavy with meat fresh from the killing
and already frozen. Furs aud soft
tanned leather clad all alike. Boys
passed with bows In Ujeir bands and
quivers of bone barbed arrows, and
many a skinning knife of bone or stone

Segregated in the heart of the camp,
Smoke came upon what«waa evidently

To one side was a silk tent—the sort
favored by explorers and wealthy big
game hunters. Smoke had never seen
such a tent and stepped closer. As he
stood looking the flaps parted and a
young woman came out. So quickly
did she move, so abruptly did she ap
pear, that the effect od Smoke was as
that of an apparition. He seemed to
have the same effect on her, and for a
long moment they gazed at each other.
She was dressed entirely in skins,
but such skins and such magnificently
beautiful fur work Smoke had never
dreamed of. Her parka, the hood
thrown back, was of some strange fur
of palest silver. The mukluks. with
walrus bide soles, were composed of

He repaired our guns and taught the
young men how. He died last year,
and we really missed him. Strayed—
that's how it happened—froze to death
witbtn a mile of camp."
It was on the same night that Snass
said to Smoke: *
"You'd better pick out a wife and
have a fire ot your own. You will be
more comfortable than with those
young bucks. The maidens' tires—a
sort of feast of the virgins, you know
—are not lighted until full summer and
the salmon, but l can give orders ear
lier if you say the word."
Smoke-laughed and shook his head.
"Remember," Snass concluded quiet
ly, "Anton is the only one that ever
got away. He was lucky, unusually
lucky."
Her father had a will of Iron, La
biskwee told Smoke. Everybody rear
ed him. He was terrible when angry.
There were the l'orcuplnes. It was
through them and through the Lusk
was that Snass traded nis skins at
the posts and got his supplies of am
muuition aud tobacco. He was al
ways fair, but the chief of the Por
cupines began to cheat, aDd after Snass
had warned him twice he burned his
iog village, and over a dozen of the
Porcupines were killed in the tight.
But there was no more cheating.
Once when she was a little girl there
was one white man killed while try
ing io escape. No; her father did not
do it. hut he gave the order to the
young men. No Indian ever disobeyed
ber father.
And the more Smoke learned from
her the more the mystery of Snass
deepened.
"And tell me if it is true." the girl
was saying, "that there was a man
and a woman whose names were Paolo
and Francesca and who greatly loved
each other?'
Smoke nodded.
"Four Eyes told me all about it,"
she beamed happily. "And so he
didn't make it up. after all. Then
there is Tristan and Iseult. two iseults.
it was very sad. But i should like to
love that way. Do all the young men
and women in the world do that?
They don't here. They just get mar
ried. They don't seem to have time.
"1 am English, and I will never
marry an Indian. Would you? That
is why I have not lighted my maiden's
fire. Some of the young men are
bothering father to make me do it
1 Abash is one of them. He is a great
hunter. And Mahkook comes around
singing songs. He is funny. Tonight
if you come by my tent after dark,
you will hear him singing out in the
cold. But father says 1 can do as 1
please, and so 1 shall not light my fire.
You see when a girl makes up her
mind to get married that is the way
she lets young men know. And how
do yon know when you are in love—
like Paolo and Francesca. I mean?"
Smoke was disconcerted by the clear
gaze of her blue eyes. "Why. they

in iove say it. that love is dearer than
life. When one finds out that he or

"Once we hit out we'll sure have
some tall runnin'," Shorty said dis
mally.
"The place is a big trap," Smoke
agreed.
From the crest of a bald knob they
gazed out over Snass' snowy domain.
"What's eatin' me is Danny Mc
Can." Shorty confided to Smoke. "He's
weak brother on any trail. But he
swears he kuows the way out to the
westward, and so we gut to pull up
with him or you'll sure get yours. It's
a-eomin' to you straight down the
pike."
"What is?"
"Y'ou ain't heard the news? The
bachelors told me. They just got the
word. Tonight it comes off. though it's
months ahead of the calendar."
"I'm waiting to hear."
"Well. Danny's wife just told the
bachelors. An' the bachelors told me,
of course, that the maidens' fires is due
to be lighted tonight. That's all. Now
how do you like it?"
"1 don't get your drift. Shorty."
"Don't, cb? Why, it's plain open and
shut. They's a skirt after you, an' that
skirt is goin' to light a fire, an' that
skirt's name is Labiskwee. Ob, I've
been watchin' her watch you when you
ain't lookin'. She ain't never lighted
her fire. She said she wouldn't marry
a Indian. An' now. when she lights
lier fire, it's a cinch It's my poor old
friend Smoke."
"It sounds like a syllogism." Smoke
said with a sinking heart, reviewing
I.abiskwee's actions of the past severe
a I days.
"Cinch is shorter to pronounce,"
Shorty returned. "An' that's always
the way—just as we're workln' up our
getaway along comes a skirt to com
plicate everything. Hey! Listen!"
Three ancient squaws had halted
midway between the bachelors' camp
and the camp, of McCaii, and the old
est was declaiming in shrill falsetto;
"Labiskwee, the daughter of Snass,
tile Rainmgker. t lie great chief, lights
her first maidens' fire tonight. Maka,
the daughter of Owits, the YV'oif Run
ner"—
The recital ran through the names of
a dozen maidens, aud then the three
heralds tottered on their way to make
announcement at the next tires.
The bachelors, who had sworn
youthful oaths to speak to no maiden,
were uninterested in the approaching
ceremony, and to show their disdain
they made preparations for immediate
departure ou a mission set them by

Not satisfied with the old hunters' es
timates of the caribou, Snass had de
cided that the run was split. The task
set the bachelors was to scout to the
north and west in quest of the second
division of the great herd.
Smoke, troubled by Labiskwee's fire
lighting, announced that he would ac
company the bachelors. But first he
talked with Shorty and with McCan.
"You be there on the third day.
Smoke," Shorty said. "We'll have the
outfit an' the dogs."
"But remember," Smoke cautioned.

plodded up the stream with their dogs

speed approach 2,000 revolutions a
minute. These revolutions are pro
duced by electric power, and the count
is made by an exact mechanical regis
ter.
The gun is placed securely at the r»
quired distance from the drum and la
sighted directly at the center of the cyl
inder, which is spinning at so many
rods- even miles—a minute, as its cir
cumference determines. With the
drum's speed adjusted, an electric cur
rent discharges the weapon, the bullet
striking the center of the drum aa
measured from top to bottom.
It must be borne in mind that with
the drum stationary the buliet would
pass directly through it on a lire of ita
diameter, coming out on the other side,
with scarcely a "shade of impediment"
With the drum's periphery whirling at
the rate of 2,000 revolutions a minute
and its diameter only a fraction more
than a foot, this would mean a rate ot
2,000 yards in sixty seconds. Thus in
the fraction of a second necessary for
the bullet to enter one side of the paper
drum, cross It and pass out at the other
side the opposite side of the drum
would show a considerable deviation
from an exact diameter of line of pas
sage.
It is this space of deflection, shown
inside the farther rim of the drum, that
is used for computing the velocity ol
■the missile. The speed of the cylinder
may be computed to the ten-thousandth
part of a second if necessary, and th«
lineal distance run in that time may b«
charted in perpendicular lines on the
Inner side of the paper. At whatever
line the bullet penetrates outward It
registers its time in crossing the diam
eter of the cylinder, if it has required
the ten-thousandth part of a second for
the bullet to proceed one foot from Its
muzzle, velocity in yards or miles may
be computed by anybody.—Pearson'«

TODAY IS YOUR DAY.
Yesterday la Only a Record and To»
morrow la a Secret.
While walking In the streets one 1 «
often greeted with the cheerful r»
mark, "It's a nice (lay!" Good days
a ndi j fcod da#» exist only in the mind.
The weather has nothing to do with
it Each day is what we make It
Suppose you get the word that yonr
salary bus been doubled or that a for
gotten uncle has left you i? 1.000,000t
What do you care about the weather
then? Or suppose the person you love
Is dying. Unexpectedly a turn for th«
better comes. The doctor says yonr
dear one will live. What if it is hotter
than Tophet? It is a good day, a great
day, a happy day. It is what we think
and feel about It that makes each day
what it is.
Put down In the notebook of yonr
soul the poet Runeberg's thought,
"Each day is a life." When you get up
In the morning throw back your shoul
ders, takq a deep breath and meet the
new day like a man. Say to yourself,
"Another day, another life!" For all
we know It may be the only day wa
shall ever have. Let us make It the
best day we can. Let us strive to
'make It a day worth while, to move a
step forward In our work, do all the
good we can, get all the happiness we
can today.
Right now Is the only time you can
control. Y'esterday is a record. To

Egypt's Famous Mosque.
Egypt was long ruled by sultans, one
of whom has given his name to what
some consider the finest specimen ot
Saracenic architecture in the worlcL
This Is the mosque of Sultan Hassan,
the pride of modem Cairenes, which
was built about 1360 , partly with stone
taken from the pyramids. So delight
ed was the sultan with the beauty of
the design that he cut off the right
hand of the architect to prevent him
building a rival edifice. Tn the walla
