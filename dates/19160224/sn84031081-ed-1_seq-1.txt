(By Morning Journal
Troops belonging' to seven German
army corps, under Crown Trlnce
Frederick William, are engaged along
a twenty-five mile, front north of Ver
dun in a desperate effort to drive
back the French defending forces,
probably with the capture of the great
fortress of Verdun in view.
There had been very heavy fight
ing for a considerable period In this
district of the French war zone, hut
within the last few days the attacks
of the. Germans have taken on added
strength. The battle line has been
extended and now reaches from Ma
lancourt on the west, to Etain on the
cast, with Verdun in the center, only
a few miles southward.
The Germans claim to have made
Important advances and to some ex
tent they are admitted hy the French
was office, which describes the battle
as one of increasing intensity.
The German preparations were ex
tensive, and the bombardment of the
French positions with thousands of
shells wus interrupted. As the French
had foreseen this battle all their
available guns were called into action
and responded In kind to. the heavy
shelling of the Gernvin. ., .. . .
While at some points the French
were unable to resist the onslaught of
the attacking forces, along much of
the front, according to the Paris com
munication, the attacks were well
sustained and very heay losses were
inflicted on the Germans.
Another British steamer, the West
burn, has put into port flying the
