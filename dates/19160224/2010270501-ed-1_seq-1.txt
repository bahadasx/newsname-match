HAVE HARROW ESCAPE;
THROWN FROM WAGON
V. Hand and Mr. Richards Dragged
out of Wagon When Team of
Mule Runs Away
An incident occurred late Tuesday
night which might have been worse
for the persons concerned, and in fact
they are congratulating themselves
that they are still alive to tell the
story.
Dr. Hand was called upon to give
medical attention to Miss Belle Rich
ards, who ia sick with la grippe, and
the young lady's father, knowing the
roads were almost impassable, came
Into town for the doctor, to save the
latter from getting Into serious
trouble In trying to make the trip
with a car.
The Journey was made without any
sorious trouble, but on the return to
town, the double tree was broken,
and the team of mules which were
being driven became rather fractious
and started at as rapid a gait as pos
sible for those animals to assume.
Finally, while the men were trying to
quiet the beasts, the pole severed
from the wagon and the men, who
were holding fast to the lines, were
thrown forward. The owner of the
team was unconscious for a short
time, while Dr. Hand says that he
landed on his nose, and while It was
a very unpleasant experience, no ser
ious injuries were sustained, and he
Is as able as ever to minister to the
needs of his patients.
