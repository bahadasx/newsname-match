ICZAR'S PRESENCE HAILED AS AN
IMPORTANT EVENT IS HIS
FIRST VISIT.
TOKEN OF A CLOSER UNION
First Case on Record Where a Rus
sian Ruler Has Entered Legislative
Body or Has Recognized It as One
of Parts of Government.
Wcttfin Newspaper Unlcn New Sendee.
PetroKrad. The presence of Em
peror N'lcholns at the opening of tho
duinu February 22 is hailed by tho
press and public as ono of the most
Important events In tho wliolo politi
cal history of Russia. II Is pointed
out that tho appearance of the em
peror In the liouso has emphasized In
the most striking manner thu increas
ing disposition of tho government and
people to lay aside internal politics
mid dovoto all their energy to a con
certed effort to bring tho war to a
successful issue.
Tho evout Is referred to by promi
nent members of the duma as "the
beginning of a new era" and likened
In its far reaching significance to tho
emancipation of the serfs and the
manifesto of 1905.
This was tho first time that a Rus
sian emperor had over visited the leg
islative body, or in this formal way
had recognized it as one of the parts
of the government. It bears upon im
portance of tho political crisis through
which Russia has been passing. Crit
ics of tho government have protested
that -since (he last adjournment of the
duma the government has not shown
any increased tendency to rellect the
desires of the populace or yield to tlte
demands for internal reform, and that
.a successful prosecution of the war
was impossible without some real un
derstanding between (he government
and the duma.
NEW CABINET POST.
German Blockade Will Be Handled by
One Man, Lord Cecil.
London. Tlo government, through
the marquis of Lansdowne. announced
in the house of lords that it had de
cided to turn over all matters connect
ed with the blockade of Germany to
one man, who would rank :s a lull
ledged cabinet minister. It is under-
toqd that tho new post will go to
Lord Robert Cecil, who, since the for
mation of tho coalition government,
has been under secretary for foroign
affairs. He will retain this post, Join
ing the cabinet as blockade minister.
Tho new minister will be charged
with tho administration of the order
in council regulating the blockade, as
well as responsible for tho general
policy and practice of the government
with respect to the trade passing to
or from neutral countries.
Lord Robert Cecil is a lawyer of
wide experience and a young roan, ns
members of tho British cabinet go.
Honored In Capital.
Washington. Every agency or tho
American government paused to pay
homage to the memory of George
Washington In tho capital which bears
his name. President Wilson, Secre
tary Daniels, Ambassador Jusserand
and other national figures gathered
nt a colobratlon at Continental Mem
orial hall, under tho auspices of asso
ciated patriotic societies. Both houses
of congress susponded business, while
Senator Johnson, of Maino, and Rep
resentative Raker, or California, read
Gen. Washington's farewell address,
with its poignant phrases, warning
against "insidious wiles of foreign in
fluence," "mischiefs of foreign In
trigues" and "tho Impostures of pre-
tended patriotism." Tho farewell ad
" dress has been road in congress every
year for generations, but probably
never before worn Washington's wprds
ho closely applied to present day con
ditions. Nine Dead; Fifty Injured..
Mllford, Conn. Disregard of a caut

STOCKHOLDER OF ROCK ISLAND
ASKS ACTION AGAINST JUDGE
CARPENTER OF CHICAGO.
HOUSE BODY GIVEN CASE
Representative Tlnkham of Massa
chusetts Acts crt Request of Boston
Man Green of Iowa to Aok Inquiry
of Charges.
Washington, Feb, 22. A petition
asking the Impeachment of Judge
Georgo A. Carpenter of the United
States court at Chicago has been Hied
with tho house Judiciary commltteo by
Representative Tinkham of Massa
chusetts. Mr. Tlnkham filed the petition on
Saturday at tho request of Christopher
F. Sweeney of Boston, ono of his con
stituents, who charged Judge Carpen
ter with Improper practice In connec
tion with tho Rock Island railroad re
ceivership. Mr. Tinkham has told the
members of the commltteo that he is
not sufficiently informed in tho Rock
Island case to say whether or not bo
believes tho committee should act on
Mr. Sweney's petition.
Tho petition, however, has been re
ferred to Representative Green of
Iowa, who said that tho questions In
It were of sufficient Importance to com
mand the attention of tho houso com
mittee. Mr. Green intimated that ho
probably would take charge of tho
case and ask the committee cither to
Investigate Judgo Carpenter or tho
present receivership of the Rock
Island or both. ."
Mr. Sweeney in his petition says
that in 1902 ho bought $10,000 worth
of Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific rail
road ! per cent bonds, paying $8,000
for them.
Tho complaint's principal contention
is that Judgo Carpenter knowingly ap
pointed as receivers mpn who wero
friendly to tho Moore-Reid group,
which had been charged by tho Inter
state commerce commission with ex
plointir.g tho Rock Island.
Tho petition also draws attention to
the fact that a receivership was asked
on a claim of $10,000 In the case of a
property worth anywhero from $400,
000,000 to $500,000,000.
It Is charged that there is a plan on
foot to bring about foreclosure on the
company's Btock and restore control to
the Moore-Reid syndicate.

tho Rock Island, makes an exhaustive
review of tho "volume of oxhlbitB"
prepared tay U. G. Powell, rato 'expert
for the stato railway commission, and
details wherein ho beliovos Mr. Pow
oll nnd tho commission havo erred in
preparing their sido of the case in the
Bult brought by tho Rock Island to
bring about a higher passenger rate.
Some of tho commission's figures, Mr.
.Smith mnlntains, should not be given
serious consideration. Others, ho ar
gues, wore reached without apparent
baslB-of fact. ,
Form of Primary Ballot Uncertain.
Secretary or Stato Pool declines
Just at present to make any official rul
ing on the form of tho ballot to bo
used In tho stnto primaries, April 18.
Tho last legislature changed the bal
lot law for general elections so as -to
havo tho names of tho candidates nnd
propositions printed in three columns,
instead of oho, thereby cutting down
tho length and Increasing the width
of the sheet. Mr. Pool is personally
of tho opinion, however, that tho
Blnuser act relating to tho ballot for
general elections does not apply at
tho primaries, and that the party tick
ets should bo mado up according to
tho old stylo. Others at the capltol
take a different view, pointing out that
tho legislature never intended to havo
two different bnllot forms in use, that
tho primaries, are govcrnbd by tho gen
eral eloction law, except whore there
is specific provision to the contrary.
An opinion from tho state legal de
partment will probably bo secured by
the secretary ot state for his guid
ance. Secretary Allen Resigns.
Secretary A. B. Allen of tho state
railway commission has announced
hlo resignation from that position,
Simultaneously ho announced the ap
pointment of Thorno A. Browne of Llm
coin as his successor. Mr, Allon will
retire to a farm which ho has pur
chased in Johnson county, near Tecum-
soh. Ho will leave about April l, and
Mr. Browne will assume tho full duties
ot secretary of tho commission nt that
time. The retiring secretary was state
oil Inspector under Governor Sheldon,
and was private secretary to Governor
Mickey,
