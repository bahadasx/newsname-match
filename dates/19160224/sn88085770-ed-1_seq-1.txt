Senate Committee Hears From
Comrade Mauer
LABORS PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM
labor's suspicion and dislike of
so-called "preparedness" was voiced
before the august senate committee
on military affairs in Washington on
February Sth by President James H.
Mauref of the Pennsylvania stat^
federation of labor, whoso speech at
that time was probably unlike any
thins ever heard in that particular
committee room before. The sena
tors who were gathered around the
I mahogany table forebore to heckle
"th,* speaker as they hail heckled sev
t eral of the "pacifists." Apparently
they felt there was too much of the
bear about him to make an encounter
acii cable.
The hearing was held under the
auspices of the Anti -Preparedness
committee, which has opened ijuar
in the Munsey Bldg., Washing
ton, D. Ci tor a fight against the
"P'.v paredneas" lobby.
After explaining that while the
Pennsylvania state federation of
labor had not taken any official ac
tion against "preparedness," he knew
that the working class as a whole in
Pennsylvania was bitterly opposed to
it. Comrade Maurcr went on to give
his reasons. His speech in part was
as follows:
"Our first reason, gentlemen, for
opposing this stampede is that we
can not sco the use of it. We feel
that instead of spending any more
money for the army and navy, we
think it would be patriotic on the part
of congress to investigate the places
that have been absorbing the money
spent in the last ten years for 'pre
paredness.'
"Up to a few months ago the Amer
ican people were told that they were
'prepared' to lick all creation. Ten
months ago intervention in Mexico
was talked of—apparently we were
'prepared' for Mexico. When the
Lusitania was sunk, the newspapers
talked about our going to war with
Germany. In fact, the newspapers
contended that we could get away
with Mexico .and Germany at the
same time if we saw- fit.
"And now when the bottom drops
out of those scares, we learn sud
denly that we are not prepared for
anything. We are told that we have
a navy of old tubs and an army poor
ly equipped. Gentlemen, it is too
much to accept in so short a time.
We feel that we are not so poorly
protected as some people contend.
"Frankly, we feel that the munition
makers are the most interested In
this 'preparedness' program. We sus
pect that they are the whole cause
of this agitation. We can not see any
reason for a foreign invasion unless
we do something to provoke it.
ELEVEN MILLION CASUALTIES
"If you had talked about a foreign
invasion two years ago we might
have been impressed by it. The Eu
ropean nations were prepared for it
as never before. But for two years
now they have been at war among
themselves. They have expended
something like forty billions of their,
wealth and they have killed and
wounded over eleven million of the
best blood and stock In Europe. And
now when they are so sunk in debt
that some people fear they can never
pay the interest on what they owe,
with their population reduced to
cripples, women and children, when
they are bleeding to death, now you
gay we have got to be afraid of them.
It don't look good to me. (Prolonged
applause.)
"I come from old American stock;
I can trace my family back for over
two hundred years in Pennsylvania,
and if I thought that the gasping na
tions of Europe could thrash us Amer
icans, I would be ashamed to be an
American. We blow about our Amer
ican manhood and honor and here we
are preparing against nations that
are actually to be pitied! (Prolonged
applause.)
■"They tell us we ought to be pre
pared against a secret, spontaneous
outbreak! What does that mean? Is
there anything on the inside that you
haven't told us about? President Wil
son said in his speech in my own
state a few days ago that in a mo
ment there may be a oonflagration;
perhaps next week, perhaps next
month. Well, I think we American
people ought to know what that dan

ger Is. I am satisfied that the Ger
man people and the Austrian people
and the people of the Allies wish to
day that they had known what the
trouble was before the conflagration
started in Europe. There wouldn't
have been the mess there is now!
(Applause.)
"I suppose none of us feel that we
ought to disarm as long as there Is
a civilized nation on earth that Is
armed. I suppose, that is the practi
cal view. Hut we are three thousand
miles from Europe and several thou
sand miles away from the Asiatics.
Suppose the Germans win. The best
they can hope for Is to secure land.
If they get that they have got to
police it and their soldiers must be
Germans. Could s^.r do that and
come over and make war on the Unit
ed States? I do not think so. Sup
pose she started. What would the
Allies he doing. And If the Allies
should make war on us. what would
Germany and Austria lie doing? No,
you can not figure it out no matter
how \ou try.
REAL REASON FOR "PREPARED
NESS"
"But I'll tell you the real reason
for 'preparedness' The American
capitalists, are financing the Euro
pean war; they are supplying the
munitions of war and the methods
of destruction. They are not selling
for cash but on credit. Millions of
dollars are today bought with pieces
of paper with crooked marks on it,
promissory notes, and the banking
interests are furnishing money to the
manufacturers so they can pay wages
and buy supplies. These promises to
pay are piling up higher and higher.
Some day there will be an end to
this European war and then over
there In Europe they will get around
a table —It's a pity they didn't get
around a table before the war broke
out (applauce) — and then they will
discuss the question of settlement.
"Suppose, gentlemen, that they de
cide to hold the munition manufac
turers of America responsible? Sup
pose they refuse to pay the robber
prices which American manufactur
ers have been charging them. Sup
pose they agree to pay only what
things are worth, or perhaps even to
repudiate the whole thing. Then a
big army and navy would be a good
thing for the American capitalist to
have at that time. They would like
to send us working men abroad as
collectors for them. I tell you we
refuse! (Prolonged applause.)
"I want to be frank with you. We
absolutely refuse to be dragged into
this thing. We are sick and tired of
being turned into fodder for cannons
and then have to pay the bills be
sides. You are going to tax us to
pay for 'preparedness' and then you
propose to go into our homes and
take out our brothers and fathers and
sons and use them for fighting. If
It's right to take a poor man's life,
it's right to take the rich man's for
i tune. WE are going to have some
voice in this thing."
PREPARATIONS MADE
FOR LYCEUM SPEAKERS
Arrangemnts are being completed
for the series of three great lectures
by the trio of National Lyceum speak
ers, including America's gifted ora
tor, George R. Kirkpatrick author of
the world's greatest anti-war book,
"War -What For?" and the famous
cartoonist, Ryan Walker, creator of
the immortal Mr. Henry Dubb and
family, followed by Comrade Emil
Seidel, former mayor of Milwaukee,
and one of the most interesting speak
ers on the American lecture platform.
Comrades living on the Island should
arrange with Comrade Pralher for a
special trip for each of the three Sun
day afternoons on which these lec
tures are to be given, and no comrade
within a reasonable distance of Ever

this city on these dates: Sunday,
March 26; April 2, and April 9.

cialist movement lo again sweep baelt

trollable passion. \\'e must put the
nation back into a straight jacket un
til it again Her; itself from the de
sire to kill. We can do il.
President Wilson made it clear on
his western lour that he did not iVar
an invasion of Hie United Stales by
any foreign foe. Then why this pre
paredness? The president answered
that question when lie pointed out,
in no unmistakable words, that the
western hemisphere must be saved
for exclusive exploitation by the
proflt< era of the United states.
The United Stall's must have an
Invincible navy and an unconquerable
army so that we can save Mexico for
the Standard Oil Co. and the Inter
national Harvester Co., so that the
West. Indies can he robbed exclu
sively by the sugar trust and Central
America by the fruit trust. The
broad plains and fertile prairies of
Argentine and other South American
countries must be reserved for the
American beef baron and wheat king,
to be plundered even as our own
"Golden West." The slogan of the
Wilson administration is, "The Amer
icas for our own American profi
teers."
LABOR NOT NEEDED NOW
That explains why President Wil
son, on his western tour, spoke only
to audiences of "industrial, commer
cial and professional men." He did
n't care about the workers in the
cities and the farmers in the rural
districts. They will not be needed
until called upon to protect, with
their blood and their lives, American
dollars Invested in other lands.
Read what President. Wilson said:
"We are not now thinking of invasion
of the territory of the United Stales.
That is not what is making us anx
ious. We are not asking ourselves:
Shall we be prepared to defend our
own shores and our own homes? Is
that all that we etand for? To keep

Wilson Dangerous Jingo
President Wilson is more danger

instance. Roosevelt shrieks for war,
for blood, for battleships and soldiers
and when he is the guest of honor
at a Gary steel trust banquet, no one
questions where he stands. Presi
dent Wilson is different. He is will
ing to compromise on an increase in
Ihe army and navy, just a little bit
bigger this year than last. And the
appropriations next year will sur
pass by just, a little those of this
year. Tims, in a few years, the Wil
son program cannot help but satisfy
even the ravings of a Roosevelt. But,
by Wilson's method, the great bur
den of militarism will have been so
deftly thrust upon the backs of the
American people that they will won

have to pay the price.

Combat Our Own Ruling Class
Our greatest task in the present
hour of the great trial now facing the
world's civilization is to combat, with
all the power we; possess, the ruling
i la IS of our own country.
'l he coming years will tell the great
service we did the .Mexican republic
in preventing intervention by the Unit
ed States, The best that, is in the
Mexican people is now coming to the
top. But our work is not at an end.
We must conquer the. ruling class at
homo so that it cannot, exploit the
peoples abroad in times of peace. The
International Harvester trust still has
power enough to shackle more slaves
in the hemp fields of Yucatan. Ex
ploitation of human flesh in the Mex
ican oil field will not end so long as
the Standard Oil trust is organized
for the purpose of coining profits for
"John D." and his pals.
We rejoiced when we heard the
peoples of China had established their
republic. The first president of the
republic was heralded as a Socialist.
But we had not conquered the Amer
ican capitalist and now capitalism is
seeking to force an emperor upon the
Chinese people in the face of a bloody
revolution. The Chinese republic
started out to conserve the resources
of the land for the benefit of the peo
ple.- But the Standard Oil trust and
other American trusts, through cor
ruption and dark conspiracy, secured
a grip upon the natural resources of
the country, and are now seeking to
perpetuate their power to exploit the
people of China.

SOME BIRTHDAY PARTY
Northwest Worker Enters Sixth
Year of Service Stronger
Than Ever
JOLLY CROWD TURNS OUT TO
CELEBRATE OCCASION
Electrical Workers Give Audience a
Thriller
Last Sunday evening the Reds of
Everett and suburban districts met
in The Forum, 1612 California St., to
Celebrate the Sixth Birthday of The
Northwest Worker, known at first as
The Commonwealth, then as The
Washington Socialist, and now as the
best paper of its kind in—well, this
.state, anyway. "Modesty," etc.
And it. was some birthday party!
In the rear of the hall there was a
most inspiring display of fancy work,
donated to the paper by the women
comrades of the state. (We insist
upon paying for these gifts with sub
scription cards, as part of our "pre
paredness" campaign). No one in
the hall failed to appreciate the spirit
of loyalty symbolized by those dainty
articles, the handiwork of women who
know. They came from all parts of
the state, thus evidencing the fact
that the service of The Northwest
Worker is recognized by coVnrades !
everywhere as being part and parcel j
of the state organization, though di
rectly under the control of but one
county. It performs the proper func
tions of a state-owfed paper but. with
out the greater expense and compli
cated machinery incident to such pub
lication. So the articles on display ]
Sunday evening had a significance
and value apart from their material
worth.
A most enjoyable feature of the
Dirthday Party was a gift of an even
ing of music by the well-known Don
nelly's orchestra. The selections ren
dered by this excellent organization
of union musicians were rendered
with the precision and spirit charac
teristic of this orchestra, and were
most heartily enjoyed by all present.
Besides the music of the orchestra,
there were several special music fea
tures introduced along with the lit
erary program, including a delight
fully rendered piano solo by Miss lia
ble Hansley, a flute duet by Comrades
Theodore Boer and Carl Melmgren,
accompanied by Miss Westberg, at
the piano, and a violin<~ello solo by
Comrade Svarrer, accompanied by his
little daughter Hattie.
Comrade Mark liartlet gave a
splendid reading of a poem on the
soap-box orator and his message,
which brought down the house. It
was both humorous and instructive.
Our talented county secretary, Carl
Ulonska, recited most effectively Vic
tor Hugo's celebrated prose poem
"The Breaking of the Neva."
Comrade Jay Olfnser was called
upon for one of his inititable straight-
from-the-shoulder off-hand talks. And
he was there with the goods, as al
ways. His graphic manner of stating
and driving home truths that should
be better realized by the Reds theun-

Dear Comrades:
I am enclosing money order for $15,
the proceeds of our fish-pond social
held Saturday evening.
We did better than we had reason
to believe we would, as times are so
hard and money is so scarce among
the workers. We took in $19.80. The
necessary expenses amounted to $4.80
and I am sending the balance of $15
to you for OUR paper. We wish all
of the comrades throughout the state
to know how much we appreciate the
work that the paper is doing for the
cause of Socialism. We expect to
keep up the work by giving these en-
selves elicited frequent outbreaks of
applause.
Comrade I,outitt was called upon
for a story, which concluded the pro
gram. We don't mention the chair
man and his little speech from the
chair, not because we want to slight
anybody, but because "self-praise Is
no praise," and we're going to invitq
you to follow the crowd to the ban
quet room; there a generous oyster
stew had been prepared for all pres
ent.
"Lets get in on this!"
A CLASS BY THEMSELVES
We mention the part, taken by the
Electrical Workers' Union separately,
as these workers form a class all by
themselves.
It was like this: During the even
ing's entertainment, the secretary of
the said union, Comrade Worswick,
handed the chairman a letter to be
jread to the audience. As the letter
j itself is far more eloquent that any
thing we can write, we give it ver
batim herewith, adding only that the
generous co-operation of this union
sent a visible thrill of pleasure and
gratification through the large audi
epce, who warmly applauded the let
ter when read. Perhaps it will be
well to say right here that this gift
of the Electrical Workers lias saved
the day for The Northwest Worker,
coming in the nick of time, as collec
tions have been more unsatisfactory
even than we had anticipated, and it
is difficult to see how we could have
avoided missing an issue of the paper.
A little better effort on the part of
/individual comrades throughout the
i state from now on will keep The
Northwest Worker out of danger, as
the worst period has now been passed.
