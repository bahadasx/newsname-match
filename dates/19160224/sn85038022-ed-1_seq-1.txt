lVaslilmrlnii. February 'A'l. I'res
dent lVllsnii nnd Congress, facing n
genuine crisis with (lermnny, nre nt
loggerheads tonight on the question of
policy. The situation Is nnprecr.
denied. Xcicr before In the history ol
the Cnlted Slates hns there been nn
ocenslou when the cxcculhc head of
the lint Ion nnd Congress lune been so
widely npnrt on n mntter of such Im
mediate gnnlty. As n climax to n day
of clinns tho (lernian reply to the lat
est demands of tho I'nllcd States
ren rlied IVltsllhlKloll tonight. It Is
understood to lie irry unsatisfactory.
The President bus told the leaders of
Congress that he Is determined to
force mi "Immedlale shown down"
with the Teutonic allies and lias warn
ed them Unit ho will not tolerate nny
Infereferncc with his bundling of In
trrniitlonnl sllunllon. Congress Is
rimiillv deteriuliied that Americans
shall be mimed off armed nierclinnt
men, totally In definnre of tho I'resI
dent's express wishes. Adinlulstrnthi
nihlsers nnd the leaders in Congrcw
tonight nre in a stnte of uncertainty
mill niiiirohpiisloii that operates op
poslte to the possibility of concerted
netlnn. Xo one of them Is willing t
nredlet what tomorrow will bring
forth.
A few outstanding points nre:
Senator Stone, chairman of tho com
mlttpft on foreign relations and the
snokesnian In tho Senate for tho ad
ministration, told his colleagues that
the President would take as a persona
affront any legislation regarding tin
submariuo Issue.
Representative Flood, chairman o
the House foreign committee, will tell
the President tomorrow morning that
a powerful group In Congress, prob
abiv a majority of both Houses, is op
posed to Ills plan of forcing Germany
to admit the right of neutrals to travel
on nrmed shins.
Majority leader Kltchin declared
that If tho President proposed to
force Oermany Into war, he could not
coilnt on tho support of Congress.
At the White House It wns an
nounced that Senator Stone, nt tho re
quest of tho President, will not make
his Intended speech In reply to Ellhu
Root's attack on the administration.
Germany's attitude, it Is understood
Is that Its earlier reply to this gov
ernment's noto acceded to every do
mand made by the Pnlted States, In
eluding tho substitution of tho wortl
"resoKiilzcs" for "assumes" liability
This reply. It is said, is Germany's
lost word so far as tho Lusitanla is-
suo Is concerned.
