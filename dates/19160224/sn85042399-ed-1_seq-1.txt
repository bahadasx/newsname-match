Grand Jury Indicts
Mischievous Boys
. The grand jury for the February
term of court met, convened and ad
journed Monday, returning seven
true bills, and four not true bills, In
the shortest Inquisitorial session In
the history of Jockson county.
E. J, Poole, a former handy man
at the Sacred Heart hospital, and In
the limelight last summer for an un
merciful beating he administered to
a son of S. A. D. Puter, the so-called
"Oregon land fraud king," was In
dicted for stealing a cow from the
institution.
James McDonald and L. Haffey,
arrested in Los Angeles for the theft
of W. H. Lydiard's Ford, were Indict
ed. E. II. Hughes was indicted for
forgery, John O'Dowd for burglary,
Frank Reed for larceny, Tobias
Smith for non support of his child.
A not true bill was returned
against J. Frank Carson for mayhem,
who was accused of biting off the
nose of a neighbor during the prog
ress of a fight last summer.
The petit jury sessions will beg'n
next Monday.
Two local high school boys who
were charge with borrowing a Ford
car, were indicted and will be kept
under surveillance until the coming
term of court convenes. ' They were
not put under bonds and may pos
sibly escape a trial if their conduct
1s deemed exemplary enough. The
boys took the car as a mischievlous
prank and have had a scare thrown
Into them which will probably insure
no further misdemeanor.
There will be a new grand jury ;
Monday next, the first seven jurors
drawn at the first opening of the
March term will constitute the granl
Jury.
The old grand Jury having cloantd
up most all matters it is quite pos
sible that the new grand jury will
convene only for a short whi'o and
adjourn until called by the olicult
judge.

house five miles from Ashland, and

stockmen of the south end of the val
ley. Chief Forester Erlckson was

serve ranges for summer range. The

decided to ask the county court to
increase the bounty upon coyotes be
lieving this to be the most effective
and Immediate means of decreasing
the danger from rabid animals.
The officers of the Stockmen's As
soclation were elected as follows:
George Dunn, president; Denver Kin-
cald, secretary. Twenty members
were present.

Game Wardens Driscoll and Walk

returned from a trip to the Jennie

a large number of deer are snow
bound and the coyotes, wolves and

The water department under the
supervision of Superintendent Earl
Hosier is laying an eight-inch water
main on Ashland street, replacing
2,000 feet of two-inch main. The
new pipe will give much better pres
sure to the entire district connected
to it, and especially to Indiana, Roca
and Elkader streets, which have had
very poor water service in the past.
As soon as the Ashland street main
is laid the department will turn to
the laying of the ten-inch iron water
main on Granite street. The pipe for
this main Is now on the ground.
The street department is taking ad-
stree's. A big six horse team is be
ing used on the big grader and sev
eral of the hillside streets have al
ready been finished. The crew Is
working on Second and Gresham
streets today.
The materials for the new street
lights which are to he installed were
held up In shipment, thus delaying
the Instalation of these lights, which,
however, will be put In as soon as
possible.
The electric light department will,
in the very near future, erect two
towers so that the electric wires may
be swung across high In the air at
the entrance to LHhia park and the
unsightly poles removed.

The spring weather is getting fnto
the blood of Ashland property owners

of his house and adding other im

B. C. Hubbard, local carpenter and
contractor, who resides on lower Lau

Monday, February 28.
Probably no play produced on the
stage in the paBt decade has created
so much favorable discussion from
people In all walks of life as Hartley
Manners' interesting comedy. This
has been emphasized most conclusive
ly by the large attendance accorded
this attraction when last presented
here, and by the glowing tributes in
the press reviews. The action of the
play, which takes place in England,
tells of a little carelessly raised Irish
girl, who, when she is transplanted!
into an aristocratic home of unknown
relatives, meets with a chilly recep
tion. She is unwelcome and tolerat
ed simply for the income they derive
through her, a legacy left her by the
will of a wealthy uncle. She finally
overcomes their dislike and wins for
herself a titled husband.
Kitty O'Connor, who Manager Mo
rosco considers a "Peg" In real life,
has the title role, and he has sur
rounded her with a cast of "types"
for the Manners comedy.
Game Warden Walker Is. of the
opinion that the coyotes are the prin
cipal foes of the deer.

That a plant for the manufacture

Big Car Shortage
Affects Lumbermen
The lumbermen of Oregon are
viewing with alarm the car shortage
which threatens to drive many of
them into bankruptcy. With much
lumber cut and ready for shipment,
with orders for all which is cut, the
railroads are not furnishing cars.
According to the lumbermen, the car
shortage is about 600 cars. It is es
timated that over a hundred cars a
day are needed.
Freight business is at a low stage
on the Southern Pacific and local
railroaders do not look for an imme
diate resumption of the heavy traffic.
All of the cars of the country are
congested at eastern points, where
the companies prefer to let them stay
rather than transfer to warehouses
before putting them on shipboard.
The Oregon lumbermen have ap
pealed to the state commission, who
In turn have telegraphed the inter

of mohair each, worth now only 30
cents a pound, but the promise is that
the price is rising. Coyotes have not
bothered the flock much during the
winter so far. Mr. Kershaw killed
about twenty of the yelping marau
ders during the winter.
