think.

Mtti,oO)iir Baby
God sent abeautiful, plumb, blue
eyed little girl to the home of the
editor last Saturday about the noon
hour, but ere the shades of evening
fell He sent an angelic "messenger
and transplanted' the little flower of
love and tenderness into the Hea-
enly garden to bloom more fragrant
among the countless thousands
there. I Just like the dainty violet
that lifts its head from its winter
bed and blooms in all its sweetness,
purity and innocence for a brief
period, only to wither at the north
winds breath, so this little flower of
love that came to scatter its sweet
ness and sunshine in our home, was
chilled by the hand of death in such
a short time. Scarcely had the
little lungs began to inhale the air
of life, the eyes to wander around
in a new world and the little form
to endear itself to the household,
when her spirit went back to the
eternal home. It is hard to give up
"flesh and blood of your own" even
when the sojourn is so short but we
know that God never made a mis
take, that it is for the best, and we
trust Him implicitly in this dispen
sation of Divine Providence and
commit the spirit of our last born to
His keeping.
A short funeral service was con

What He Does Not Print
The average newspaper man has
much to say. on the subject of the
news that he prints, and as a rule,
there is plenty and of sufficient var
iety to appeal to all classes of readers.
The good citizens may : wish that
there were more of. the "things in
which he is specially , interested, but
being fair-minded will readily con
cede that his wish is impossible of
fulfillment, as the tastes . of many
have to be consulted.
There are ; a few in every com
munity who censure the editor , be
cause he does not print an occasional
happening thai may appear of great
importance to these few. The editor
rarely explains: It would . be a
waste of words-- But the chances
are that in his heart of hearts he is
more proud of the fact that he does
not print somethings than of all the
big stories that he has ever served
up to his readers. He recalls in
after years, not the things that he
did print, but those that remainded
imprinted, says the Burlington Hawk
Eye. There he has saved a family
or a circle of friends or some indivi
dual, shame and grief and he can
not doubt, that such things are re
membered and that there is a warm
spot in the hearts of those interest
ed, because the newspaper man
suspended the rules and refused to
print what a number of the minority
would have considered the best kind
of a story.
Whether he is ever, rewarded in
any or not, his - Own conscience
brings him a reward that is Of suffi
cient value to recompense him over
and over again for everything that
may be said against this course.
He may be ridiculed by a 'few and
upbraided by others, but his is a
sounder sleep, his is a greater love
and respect for his calling, because
it enables him thus to do good in a
manner that could be accomplished
in no other way. Occasionally some
one prominent in his own profession
may attempt to convince him of the
error of his ways. But he goes on
doing good in his own way and per
mits no one or ; nothing to swerve
him from his course. He may. have
r many 'faults,' thet;few'whhaVe
tnem not, ouc mis one virtue win
outweigh all faults and in the opinion
of those who know him best, , that
one virtue will atone .for all the
mistakes- that he could possibly
make. No matter how often he
may err in a case of that kind he
is always right.

May Open Indian Mounds
in Bertie
In order to show the great state
of civilization to which the Tuscarora
Indians of this State had advanced
which will be patt of the history of
Bertie County now being written by
United States District Attorney
Francis D. Winston, it is very prob
able that the Smithsonian Institute
at Washington will send an expert
to open two large Indian mounds in
that county. Governor Winston is
now negotiating with the authorities
at the institute to send the expert.
Governor Winston hopes to show
from the pottery, impit m ?nts and
other things found in the mounds
the great , state of civilization to
which that tribe had advanced and
also show conclusively that they
are Iriauovian stock and not of the
Ateonauins. Mr. James Mooney,
himself an Indian, and connected
with the Smithsonian Institute is
considering going to Bertie county
for that purpose.
