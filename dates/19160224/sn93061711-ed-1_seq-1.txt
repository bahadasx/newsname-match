thought, have been killed by the cold

A brother, John F. Roll, who is well
known in this county, owns a farm
southeast of Nara Visa and it is with
great pleusure he shown his excellent
herd of pure-bred Hereford. He just
recently bought and shipped to this
county a nearly perfect malo to head
his herd. This animal is the best
specimen it has been our opportunity
to gaze upon. Mr. John Hull has sold
all of tho young males from last year.
He got $125 each for them. Seven In
ono idiipment, wcro sent to Roosevelt
county. John llurns, Nara Visa's cap
italist, bought one to improve his herd
and numerous others wore distributed
over Quay county.
Nnra Visa has three large general
merchaiuli.se stores and nearly every
other business properly represented,
with tho possible exception of not
having n newspaper, something a real
live town cannot get along without.
Theodore Keulin hns lately purchased
a small ice-making out-fit and is now
busy installing it in a cement build
ing in tho main part of town. He in
tends to put in an electric light plant
in connection with the ice-plant and
Nara Visa will enjoy thu modern con
veniences of her Inrger sister.

the smaller business houses and has
lately installed a high wntcr tower
which furnishes all of his tenants with
plenty of fresh water at n nominal
sum, being just as convenient as n
regular city waterworks.
The only objection we could find
to thu citizenship of Nara Visa was
that somo of thu citizen think they
should oppose anything an opposite
faction stnrts no mutter whether they
believe it wrong or not. Most of them
are well read and tho ladies aro as
good politicians as the men.
If something could be brought about
to unite tho citizenship Nara Visa
will make ono of the best towns in

Messrs, Goldunbcrg and Funk, went
to Stratford, Texas to look at tho

that town M. B. nsked tho rates on
grain from that point to El Paso, and
learned that they were ablo to ship
through Tucumcari to El Paso, a dis
tance of about 150 miles further than
from hero to HI Paso, for five cents
a hundred less. This is ono of the
reasons Tucumcari buyers cannot pay
as much for grain ns Tcxus buyers.

I TICK-FREE LIVESTOCK
In the ever-growing nrcn from which
I the cattle tick hits been eliminated,
, demniiHtration agents nre now showing
the pcoplo how they can realize the
, full benefits of their bucccsh in tho
k
campaign of eradication. Purebred
lock is being brought in to improve
quality of the nntivc cattle, farm
ers who have never paid any attention
' to the creamery that month waH
i i di r ...I.. r. i. u
M.815 pounds. For it the farmers
received $3,851.88, an average of ap
proximately $17 each.
The importation of good hulls, both
for beef and dairy herds, is of spe
cial significance, sinco this was prac
tically out of the question in the tick
days, because of tho danger of death
from Texas fever. In consequence,
the grading up of the herds was im
possible, and there was too little mon
ey in the feeding of ticky scrubs to
make it an attractive undertaking.
This wbb also true of dairying with
tiie same kind of stock, for the mine
production, poor at best, was reduced
by the ticks in cases of heavy infesta
tion by ns much us 40 per cent. On
tho other hand, tho possibilities of
profit in grading up herds nro very
great.
It is, of course, not every stockman
who can afford the exclusive ubo of a
purebred bull. The small farmer with
ono or two cows gains, however, just
as much in proportion by breeding
them to a purebred instead of a scrub
and the gain is oven mora important
to him. For this reason tho depart
ment is now encouraging tho forma
tion of live-stock associations and bull
clubs in which n number of farmers
unitu in tho purchase of a bull. The
county agents and special demonstra
tors are also urging upon fanners in
the areas recently freed from the ticks
the following plnn for getting a start
in the live-stock Industry:
Get Bermuda grass started on all
pastures further by sowing come I
pedczn and bur clover on the uplands
"d somo nlslko clover or white clover
on the bottom lands.
r , , .11 . .
i.i row moru nay ana omer xoragv
on which to wintei tho stock, or erect
a silo if you hnvo ns many us 10 dairy
cattlo or 20 beef cattle.
Bring in good bulls to use for grad
ing up tho nativo cattle. Do not try
to raise purebreds to begin with.
If not nblc to buy a bull for individ
ual uso, form a bull club.
Form a cummunity club or county
livo-stock association so that members
may exchange bulls every two years
and thus obtain the maximum ser
vice from a bull without breeding him
to his own offspring.
Heifers of the beef breeds should
not drop calves until they are 30 or
more months old.
Breed all beef cows so an to calvo
during February, March and April.
Breed nil dairy cows so as to have
them cnlvo in thu fall.
Wean tno beef calves in the fall.
Give them plenty of good, bright hay,
silngc if available, and about 1 pound
of cottonseed meal per day for tho
first month. After that they can bo
wintered on the roughage produced on
tho plnco and little concentrate.
The breeding stock in the beef herd
may bo given tho run of tho stalk
fields until tho middle of winter and
then fed on roughness. As tho cows
will bo carrying calves, they should
bu kept in a thrifty condition.
If possible dip all of the stock each
spring and fall to keep them free of
lico and to put their skin in good con
dition. Novor keep u grade bull for a sire
if a purebred one can be secured.

QUARANTINE LIFTED
Tho city bonrd of health has raised

Of courso there may bo danger of
a new contagion unless tho necessary
precaution is taken. Any evidence of
scarlet fever, diphtheria, smnll-pox,
or measles will bo wutched and quar
antined ns soon as found but it is
hoped thnt nothing of this kind will
show up as Tucumcari cannot afford
to operate under quarantine nil the

Last Friduy night the Funk pinn

About seven o'clock Mr. Funk went
to tho postofllce for hi.i mail and re
turned homo about 7:15. Ho went
into tho mill after u few tools which
he desired to use while at work that
evening on the insido of his residence
which ho has been remodeling. There
was no sign of fire in the building
at that time. About an hour lutcr
Mrs. Funk discovered the fire and the
alarm was turned in.
The fire boys mnde a record run
but tho building burned liko tinder
and it looked for u time like the big
houso on tho south und Mr. Funk's
ne'v residence on tho north would bo
caught on fire, but thu work of the
firemen save all the adjoining prop
erty from any damage and succeeded
in soon putting out the fire, or enough
to save somo of the machinery and
feed. The tools, or most of them,
wcro rendered useless and the loss
was heavy. The building was insured
for 000 while the machinery was in
sured for $150, being only a fraction
of tho rcnl value of the tools and ma

FLOYD BESS GIES AF
TER LONG ILLNESS
-T1 OTHER DEATHS
Floyd Hess died lat Friday even
ing nt 7:30 o'clock after nn Minos
extending back moro than u year.
At first it was thought ho would have
no serious difficulty nnd ho would soon
recover his former excellent health.
Hut when it was found that ho was
suffering from pernicious anemia,
(n deficiency of blood in the systom
or of red cotpuscles in the blood),
tho physicians pronounced his case in
curable, but his many friends hoped
against the inevitable nnd relied on
Floyd s iron-clad will to pull him out
of his precarious condition.
Moyd was n self -made man having
been left to make his own way through
life when but a mere child. Ho work
ed his way through school and ob
tained u good education. He gradu
ally climbed the ladder and success
was within his grasp when fnto turn
ed against him and thu last fuw months
of his life were filled with suffering
and disappointment, but Floyd re
mained jovial and dcspondci. wns
unknown to him.
At tho time of his death he held
the highest position nnd standing on
this section of tho Rock Island and
E. P. & S. W. lines, within the gift
of the Western Union Telegrnph Co..
nnd was ever faithful to his company.
The passing of Floyd Bess takes
from our midst ono of our very best
young citizens, nnd is mourned by ev
ery acquaintance in Tucumcari ns well
ns all ulong thu railroads where ho
was known. He was an athleto of tho
highest order, being ono of tho best
base ball players ever donning n suit
in Tucumcari, and always being In
first-class physical condition it is hard
to understand how disease could se
cure any hold upon him, but nfter re
covering from several attacks ho was
again taken sick n few weeks ngo and
died Friday evening.
The funeral services wcro conducted
from tho home on Second street at
2:30 by Rev E. J. Hocring of tho Epis
