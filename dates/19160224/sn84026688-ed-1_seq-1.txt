TCopy riff !i*t. 191*6. by W. G, Chapman,) |
If Eph Knight had come back a rich i
man it is probable that Lausanne would j
Lave seen its first lynching. But Eph i
came back a tired, wornout man of |
forty-three, stone-poor; and before |
Lausanne knew that he was In town
again he had taken a mechanic's job in ,
the auto factory which is all that keens i
Lausanne's population up to the live .
thousand mark.
His disappearance had not been so |
sensational as his return. He was liv- j
ing at the hotel and Hinging money I
around. Everybody knew Eph; he had
been born on a farm and had down
kites and made flying machines in the
days when Langley was a national jest.
He had been on the verge of success,
however, ut last A company—the
Knight company —had been formed to
exploit the new flying machine which
the Wrights were soon to consign to
the scrap heap. All Lausanne had gone
crazy over his dream. The Widow
(Jill, whoso daughter Polly. Eph had
been courting, invested twelve hun
dred dollars in the concern. Then the i
Wrights took out their patent and j
Eph’s company turned turtle.
"Keep the stock, it will be valuable i
some day," Knight had told Mrs. Gill.
And it still reposed, forgotten, among
a number of papers —her insurance en
dowment, the title to the farm, etc., in
the safety-deposit box that the Widow
Gill held at the local hank. But Knight
jSpS

had fled, while his worthless stock ;
went tumbling about his cars.
That was eight years before, and ;
Polly had grown from a beautiful girl
to a disappointed spinster of consider
ably more than thirty. Nobody expect- .
ed Polly to marry, although she had
had suitors before Knight put in his
appearance. But nobody dreamed that I
Knight was still the knight of her j
heart, and that she repeated his words |
to herself every evening:
“I’ll ho true to you, Polly, however >
long I'm gone. And I'll come for you j
some day, never doubt me, dear."
Then Knight had come hack, to
board at the Widow Gill's, instead of
at the hotel. At first the people of
Lausanne evidenced sullen antipathy
Some still hold Knight’s rotten scrip;
a few had unloaded theirs upon credu
lous neighbors. But the Widow (Jill
had forgiven him.
"It ain't Eph's fault," she would ex
plain. "He couldn't knciw the Wrights
would get out their patent ahead of
him like that."
Something about her tone made
folks prick up their ears. Surely it
wasn't possible, hut it was! Eph
Knight was courting Polly Gill again—
he, the twelve-dollar mechanic, and
she the seven-dollar stenographer.
And the old maid look was being
ironed out of the face of this woman
of thirty-four, and Eph Knight stepped
down the street beside her like a
young man again.
There was no doubt of it. They I
were to be married some day—some |
day, when Eph's dreams came true.
But .Eph wouldn’t hear of his wife
working, and twelve dollars cut no
ice even in Lausanne, Worst of all,
Eph still had those invention ideas
swarming in his head. He didn't stay
long at work. As soon as he had saved
a hundred dollars he put up a shed and
started on his models. This time tie
was devising a new torpedo. A hundred
dollars, with board to meet, doesn't
go far in making torpedoes.
Eph became raggoder and more un
kempt. it was seen that to would
never be able to take care of Polly.
Only the girl and her mother be
lieved in him at all, and he was get
ting behind in his board. The chances
of marriage were more and more re
mote. People spoke indignantly of
the fellow.
Then the war broke out, and Eph s
torpedo was nearly completed He
uad the plans drawn, and off he went
to Washington, to submit them to the
patent office. He found that tie would
nave to prove they were workable and
returned to the factory. He was re
fused permission to experiment there

Nobody in Lausanne would help
THURMONT, FREDERICK COUNTY, MD., THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1916.
Eph, oven if ne had wanted to be
helped. Jim C.'arew set the pace, and
lie was bitter agiunst Eph. Carew
had turned Eph's invention into a com
pany concern and he was leaded down
to the heels with the worthless stock.
Eph wanted Polly badly: he humbled
himself to go to the magnate and ask
for work an ins chauffeur!
"Your mans left, 1 hear," Eph be
gan.
“You want the job. ’ said Carew, and
a devilish clever thought came to him.
"How would twenty-live a ween suit
you?" he asked.
"Finely, said Eph.
"I'll lake you, then. And I’ll pay
you twenty-five—in the Knight com
pany stock.'
Eph never blinked. "That suits me,"
he answered. And he went to work.
The Knight company, insolvent as
ever, made steel castings in a small
nay, and the twenty-live dollar shares
were still to he had, if anyone wanted
them, at about three dollars apiece.
The winow had fiLy. Carew held
forty thousand, and every Saturday
one was unloaded on Eph. After a
couple of months tne magnate grew
reckless.
"I'll raise you to a hundred," ho
said. That meant about twelve dol
lars a week to Eph. 'Actually, Carew
was afraid of losing a good chauffeur.
"I'll make it two hundred,’ he said a
little later. "Pretty good salary lor a
chauffeur?'
"Yes, sir,’ said Eph.
Eight shares a week passed into
Eph'a pocket, or twenty-five dollars at
the actual Knight prices. In six
months lie held something over tv.o
hundred shares, representing a capi
tal of SOOO. Polly was jubilant. He
had spoken of marrying her.
One Saturday Carew said "I'll buy
back those snares at live apiece, Eph
I hear the company s doing a little
business. I understand you haven t
cashed in on them.
"I’m going to hold them, sir" said
Eph "I m going to sell them my tor
pedo and, when they start manufac
turing. the shares will be worm the
old price, and something more.
'Well, I'll pay you cash in future, *
grumbled Carew.
"There wont be any future,' an
swered Eph. "I'm going to leave you
tomorrow, Mr. Carew.
He did, and the bans were put up in
church, while Eph went hack to the
shed and invested everything in a
forge and torpedo metal. Folks pitied
Polly now. They spoke more harshly
of Eph than ever. He had sold ms
stock at six. and it was rising, rising.
It became twelve, twenty, fifty- The
war boom broke with a vengeance It
rose to ninety. It touched a hundred.
There was a wild flurry to sell. Every
one sold except the Widow Gill, whose
live thousand dollars worth remained
in the hank vaults. People alternately
cursed and praised Eph, according as
they had won or lost
"It’ll touch two hundred," said Eph,
when the slump followed Only Knight
stocks held steady. Nobody under
stood.
Not till Eph and Polly, both radi
antly happy, had started on their
honeymoon. Then the papers wore
full of the news. The Knight com
pany --Kph Knight, president, had the
exclusive right to manutacture me

ments. And Eph, who had sold at six.
held fifty thousand shares, new shares,
at two hundred;

KILLING ANTS WITH CANNON
Only Way Known to Kill Off Destruc
tive Little Warrior Insects Com
mon to South Africa.
It is hard to imagine big guns kill
ing anything except men and horses.
In South, AlTiea and other tropical
counties, however, they are used to kill
ants —the termites, or warrior ants.
These ants are highly organized. They
live in a republic ot their own, and
are divided into classes ol workmen,
soldiers and queens.
The workmen construct the huge
nests, the soldiers defend them and
keep order, and the females, or queens,
are cared for by all the others.
The ant heaps ot these particular
ants are often twenty feet high and
pyramidal in shape. Cattle climb up
on them without crushing them. A
dozen men can find shelter in some ot
their chambers, and native hunters
often lie in wait inside them when out
after wild animals—after the nests
have been deserted, of course
The ants construct galleries wnich
are as wide as the bore of a large
cannon, and which run three or four
feet underground, if we built houses
as big in proportion, a workingman
would live in a dwelling as big as a
pyramid of Egypt.
Those ants are frightfully destruc
tive, and the only w r ay to kill them off
Is to blow them and their nests to
pieces with guns loaded with grape
shot.
Needed.
A woman who nad had four stalwart
soldiers billeted on her endeavored to
use as little butcher meat as possible.
Day after day there was served up
at dinnertime a scanty meal, the chief
item ot which was tea.
Ah, * she said one day, pointing to
a lea-leal floating in one of the cups,
"there’s to be a visitor today!
"Well, madam,' said one ot tne
hungry tour, "let us hope it s the

BIRDS IN CEMETERIES
AUDUBON SOCIETIES INTEREST
ED IN BIG PROJECT.
Idea Is to Have Burial Grounds Con
verted Into Sanctuaries Where
Feathered Friends of Human
ity May Find Refuge.
More than a million acres of land
will be added to the bird reservations
in the United States if the National
Association of Audubon societies, with
headquarters in New York, succeeds
in Its campaign to have all the ceme
teries of the country con varied into
bin! sanctuaries. The plan includes
not only the forty-eight burial grounds
of Now York city, but all cemeteries
down to tho lonely graveyard of the
smallest hamlet.
"While the average visitor to ceme
teries is frequently Irrmn ae-1 with
tho song of bird.., ’ T. Gilbert
Pearson, secretary of tho association,
who has brought forward this plan,
"this is due rather to the usual quiet
and perhaps to the receptive mood of
the person. Tle i rof birds is
really small com'..red to what it
would ho were hut a little effort made.
Much has ooon u, o • to drive birds
away from ceraeleaes. Frequently,
there is not a ya. .1 of underbrush
where a thrashoi or vireo can build
its nest. There are no pools or other
means for the tii..•■> suiko their
thirst. Tree surgery has closed tho
cavities whence liuuuuso, wren or
bluebird formerly issued to console
the lonely visitor. Fruit-bearing trees
have been removed ami there is an
absence of berry-bearing shrubs, such
as birds enjoy. ’
The association, in addition to the
above needs, is urging the exclusion
of gunners and eats from the ceme
teries, the latter through the use of
\ cat proof fences. The placing of bird
boxes in trees is recommended, as
well as tho construction ot fountains
or other drinking places for the birds.
Food in the way of growing blackber
ries, strawberries or mulberries is sug
gested, while many cemeteries are
said to nave ample waste space where
buckwheat and other smtJ! grain
could ho planted without detracting
from the beauty of the landscape. The
supplying of food in c.’her ways as
well as the provisions for nesl-build-
Ing are among other suggestions con
tained in a circular just issued by the
association which, Mr. Pearson says,
he will mail to all persons interested
in having their city cemetery con
verted into a bird sanctuary. In In
dianapolis thousands of birds find ref
uge in (Town Hill cemetery ami birds
of some varieties which generally go

Crossbred Yaks to Feed Alaskans.
No breed of dairy or beef cattle
has as yet been found hardy enough
to stand the winters in tho interior
of Alaska without excessive expense
for food and protection against cold.
As a result milk sells for 50 cents a
quart and the beef that is consumed
In the country consists almost wholly
of cold storage meat brought from the
outside. The Journal of Heredity sa>s
that the Alaska Experiment station
has undertaken to relieve this situa
tion by crossing the hardy Scotch
Galloway cattle with the yak, an Asiat
ic ox much used by Mongolians, Tibet
ans, etc., for milk and meat as well
as work.
The yak pastures through the win
ter under the open sky in Siberia and
obtains feed from last year’s grass dug
from under the snow. Crosses of Hie
yak with domestic cattle are common
in Asia and highly successful.
Bear Caught In City.
A fat black bear, weighing nearly
400 pounds, was trapped and killed on
the edge of the city limits near Cowen
park, according to a dispatch from Se
attle. and about one and a half miles
from the university.
The downfall of bruin was brought
about by two unknown men, who sold
the bear while It was in the trap to
A. Lampaert, a butcher of Redmond,
I for S2O. According to tho men who
trapped the animal, it had established
Its headquarters on the hill near the
Cowen Park ravine, and had appar
ently decided to spend the winter
there.
The bear was in prime condition
and had evidently found the back
1 yards of Cowen Park residents fine
foraging grounds.
Missed Big "Successes."
The death of Gebrge Edwardes re
calls how he sold "Dorothy” for a
song, and how a song—“ Queen of My
Heart” —made a fortune for the piece.
The death of Lewis Waller recalls the
case of "Monsieur Beaucaire.” That
play, when ’’tried on the dog” at Liver
pool, was a dead failure. The "dog s”
verdict was wrong. Produced as a
mere stop gap at the Comedy, “Beau
' caire” proved a big and instant suc
cess. It ran for some 400 times, and
had the crowning triumph of a royal
command performance at Saudring
ham.
That’s What.
"What is a military attache, father?”
“A military attache is an official who
has to be recalled as soon as he is
■ caught doing what he is paid to do.”
Conceited.
‘What is a self-made man, father?”
‘‘A self-made man, my boy, Is one
j who thinks that the Creator could not
possibly have produced such a wonder
1 fu! being as he is.”
I We Loving I
Gup
By Augustus G Sherwin iijj
(Copyright, ibid, by 'ljv. (3. Chapman.)
His pulse beat high, his eye glowed
with excitement, the pride of life was
in its fullest expression. It was a
moment supreme —the high point ot
fame and favor.
The loving cup!—it stood before
him —a delicate, costly creation, ami
to Ross Worden the script letters of
his name, showing out in clear relief,
were to him as grand and precious us
though blazoned from some great
scroll of fame. As Hie last words ex
pressing his heartfelt appreciation of
the gift friendly souls had bestowed
upon him fell from his lips the warm
applause of tried ami trusted friends
thrilled him to his loyal soul.
“There will be a bigger one when
you come back from Hie front, Wor
den!” hurrahed a convivial member
of the group of journalists, artists and
men of wealth and fashion.
“It's a new experience,” said an
other. ‘T fancy it will he Inspiriting
and new.”
‘ Decidedly,” commented a grizzled
veteran newspaper man with a scarred
face, who had written war stories on
the actual field sixty years agune.
“Good luck, old fellow.” hailed an
ambitious-looking young man, Dale
Armour, his pretty, blushing sister,
Nella. on his arm.
Worden paused. The reigning pride
in his face softened down to a sefitl
moot of Interest, an emotion subtle
and compelling. He was sincerely glad
when someone accosted Armour and
engaged him in conversation.
“Just take charge of Nella for a min
ute or two, won't you?” suggested Ar
mour, and Worden found himself be
side the lovely girl in a retired corner
of the rlubroom.
Her presence acted upon him like
some sweet angelic creature leading

him from the feverish atmosphere of
society Into tho calm of soulful peace,
ns if in some sylvan solitude. She had
only commonplace compliments for
the honor bestowed upon him, friendly
wishes for his success as an aspiring
war correspondent. Vet present and
future were obscured to his mental
vision as ho looked into her beautiful
eyes. Their shrinking depths seemed
to work some alluring power ho could
not analyze.
A rose had fallen from tier corsage.
He picked it up and placed it tenderly
between the leaves of a memorandum
book.
“An amulet,” ho said in a low, in
tense tone —"may I keep it without of
fending you?"
Her lips formed a voiceless assent.
She was all a-tremble. Her breath
came quickly. In rash impetuousuess
he reached to take her hand.
"All right, sister, it's getting late,"
intervened Dale. “Thanks, Worden,
and again good luck go with you,” and
the fairy vision vanished and the
words unspoken that meant happiness
unutterable.
“Better so," sadly soliloquized Wor
den as he reached home alone an hour
later. "What can I offer that delicate
creature of assurance of the luxury
she is born to? Again, why burden
her with a tie that may mean bereave
ment from the first battle Held? No,
it it better as it is. ’
Six months to the day and Ross
Worden, begrimed, footsore, limping
wearjly, crossed a barren, desolate
stretch of Belgian territory just at
dusk. He presented the appearance
of some homeless refugee, war-driven
from shelter and security. In the dis
tance in almost every direction the
glow of camp lires showed, and ever
and anon a bomb burst in midair.
Half a mile beyond the open
stretch was a ridge of hills, and be
yond that Boss Worden, fresh from
the country of the enemy, loaded met
aphorically with information that
comprised the "war scoop” of the cen
tury, knew where the friendly army
lay.. Particularly he scanned the ob
servation towers here and there dimly
outlined against tho fading evening
sky. One of them was a signa. and tel
egraph tower. For that be made, eag
erly as a pilgrim for a tiiecca
He hummed a tav U.ne as lie tolled
onward. It was one played that night
of the loving-cup episode. He thought
of Nella. He took from his pocket his
memorandum book. From between Its
pages he tenderly lifted the rose, now
faded, to his lips.
Ah! for her sake was he glad that,
striking out on an independent line,
he had penetrated to the very heart
of the enemy’s country, was returning
witii secret and exclusive information
which, blazoned forth to an interested
reading world, would signalize intrepid
efforts and place him high among the
great war correspondents of the year.
With almost a cheer Ross Worden
dragged himself into the signal tower.
The opera lor stared askance. A man
lounging and smoking nearby stared,
sprang up in astonishment and cried
out;
"You —Worden!"
Worden recognized the man, Bierce
Disbrow, a journalist of poor repute,
a man he did not like. He greeted him
in a friendly way, hut instantly cen
tered his attention upon the operator.
He drew a dozen closely-written sheets
from his pocket.
"Union News service, my man," he
announced. "You must get this copy
to the cable Instauter!"
‘All right," nodded the man. while
Disbrow glared with envy at what bo
surmised from the exultant face of
Worden must comprise some big
"scoop,”
"Look out!" abruptly shouted Dis
brow, and bolted for the open air. The
others were not so fortunate. An un
expected bomb had come direct from
the enemy's camp across the river It
shattered the frail station as though
it were an egg shell. When the
devastation was complete Disbrow
crept in among Lie debris. He found
the operatoi dead and Worden insen
sible ami apparently fatally injured.
Ho crept forth again in possession of
tire "scoop” data of Boss Worden.
Three months later, poor, wretched,
limping, a mere shadow of his former
self, Ross Worden returned to the city
which he had left with such high
hopes. When he reported to his news
bureau it was to bo treated coldly, in
differently, as a man who had failed
to make good. It was then that he
learned that the news he had gathered
at such peril had been used by Uis
brow, who hud received high credit
for the same.
The discovery crushed him. He
was still ill from his wound received
in Hie explosion. He sought poor, ob
scure lodgings; lie was prostrated
with a fever. To pay his way his land
lord piece by piece pawned his few
possessions even the loving cup.
Then a spell of fever and delirium,
and he awoke in a beautiful room, and
a beautiful woman was ministering to
his wants—-Nella Armour!
It was no dream, and this was the
Armour home, and soon Dale Armour
was at his side and telling him how
they had found him- poor, ill, desert
ed by his friends.
“It was Nella who did It," he said.
"Ho you notice yonder your loving
cup? She saw it In a window on sale,
redeemed It and that led to our trac
ing you, and now —dear old friend,
look! ”
Hale Armour held before the eyes
of Worden a newspaper exposure of
the i> rtidy of Fierce Disbrow in steal
ing the credit of the great "war
scoop." This rehabilitated Wor
den, and with restored health the high
est ranks of journalism were open to
him.
Convalescent a week later, Nella
Armour pressed to his lips a cup con
taining medicine. She kissed the rim
tenderly as she did so, for there was
a perfect understanding between
them now. His eyes Ailed with tears
of joy.
"The loving cup!” he murmured—
“the loving cup, full to overflowing!”
NOT EVEN LOVERS’ QUARREL
Dialogue Might Have Seemed of Sig
nificance to Listener, but Really
It Had None.
(A dialogue between He and She.)
"What have you got there?”
"Where?"
"In your hands, behind your back.”
"I'm not going to show you. ’
"Ah, please do."
"Promise you won't try to take it
away from mo?"
He sneaks up close to the girl, who
furtively holds before him a photo,
which he clutches with both hands.
"That's beautiful!”
“Do you really think so?”
“Yes, pretty nice. But you are
much more beautiful, you know. ’
"Now you’re flattering me. 1 think
I look just horrid in It.”
“Oh, you don’t. Aren’t you going
to give this one to me?”
The girl flies to the other aide of the
room in evident terror. The youtli
flies over after her, and in an apparent
struggle manages to (quite easily)
wrench the photo from her grasp.
“Give it back to me! Please give it
back!" she pleads.
"Give it back? 1 guess not!”
“1 think you’re just the meanest
thing! ’
In a little while they quiet down,
an; I ,* despite the fact that she contin
ues to coax him for the photo every
few minutes, he carries it away with
him. She goes to bed perfectly hap
py, for she intended that he should
have it; in fact, had it taken espec
ially for him—Detroit Free Press.

Seats, and the Catas
trophe Followed.
Just to please his wife (lie obliging
man bought tickets for a play that he
did not want to see, on a Saturday aft
ernoon when the only two seats avail
able were the width of the house
apart. The ticket seller was sorry and
correspondingly generous with sugges
tions for relief.
"It won't make much difference,
since the lady is your wife," he said;
"still it would be nice for you to sit
together. If the person sitting be
side either of you happens to have
bought a single seat perhaps he will
change. It would he worth trying,
anyhow."
The obliging man thougiit it would
be. He had an end seat. His neigh
bor was a lady. She was good-look
ing. She talked to no one, she looked
at none. The obliging man concluded
that she was seeing the play alone.
It took courage lo put his conclusion
to tile lest, but the ticket seller's sug
gestiou hammered away persistently,
so during the first intermission the
obliging man leaned sideways and
said:
1 beg your pardon, are you here
alone?"
His tone was courteous, lus manner
chivalrous, hut the rudeness of a
navvy would have inllamed her less,
f rom a kindly, g. u;ic lady she was
transformed into an outraged goddess.
She looked at the obliging man just
once, but that was enough; he fell
buck limply.
Then sin: spoke, not to him, but to
uu usher passing down the aisle.
"Can you get me another stall?" she
said. I can't sit here any longer.
"Tills man has insulted me."
"1 only—" began the obliging man,
but the usher wouldn't let him liiush.
He looked nearly as ferocious as the
lady.
"Fortunately I can,” ho said. "A
lady on the other side of the house
is not pleased with the seat she's got,
so I'll bring her over here. He won t
bother her.”
He fore the obliging man could get
up lo let her pass tlie insulted lady
had walked right over him, and, un
der the guidance of the usher, was
marching over to the opposite side of
the house.
They stopped before a woman who
looked most uncomfortable in her
loneliness.
"Perhaps this lady will change seats
with you," said the usher.
"1 shall be glad if you will," said
the injured one, "but before you go it
is ru> duty to warn you. You will
have to sit beside a regular beast of
a mail, lie insulted me. That is why
I had to leave."
The lonely woman was standing up.
She saw where the other woman had
eouie from. Her face darned.
"What did ho say?” she demanded.
"He wanted to Know if 1 was hero
alone.”
The usher tried to show the lonely
lady the way, but she got there be
fore him. Without ceremony she
dropped into the unoccupied seat.
"Now," said she, "1 want to know
all about it. What did you mean by
psking that red headed woman if she
was here i lone?"
He tried to tell her then, he has
tried to tell her since, and no doubt
ho will be trying to tell her on his
death-bed, but ho might as well save
his breath. She will never believe
him.— New York Times.
Misunderstood Direction.
Many siWes of the high-class apart
ment housi s in New York use the al
phabet Instead of numericals to desig
nate them. It is more classy, you
Know. The other day Mary Miles Min
ter, the winsome little lilm star, ac
cording to Hide Dudley, offended a
man, and she would not have done It
intentionally for the world. He culled
at the Min;or home, apartment A, in
a Harlem Hat building, seeking a
friend who lives in apartment U. He
had misunderstood the elevator hoy.
"Does Mr. t uith live here?” he asked,
as Miss Mir,ter appeared at the door.
She shook her head. “Go to H," she
replied. The man went downstairs
and complained to the building’s su
perintendent. When he was made to
understand what Miss Miviter meant
he cooled down. But he was pretty
mad for a v idle.
Operates in Red Light.
The sensitiveness of the eye to red
light has led Doctor Bergonie of Paris
to employ such light in surgical oper
ations and lu making radiograms of
the human body. The operating room
is lighted by only a rod lamp. The pa
tient Is radiographed upon a fluores
cent green screen of platinocyauide of
barium and the imago is seen with a
distinctness far greater than when the
observer was in a white light before
looking at it. During the operation the
red light makes venous blood appear
almost black in strong contrast with
arterial blood, while the slightest
asphyxia in the anesthetized subject
shows itself Instantly in a blackening
of the wound.
