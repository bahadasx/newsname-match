First Farmers' Day at Omaha Motor
Exposition Proves to Be a Great
Success and Will Be Re

TONIGHT IS SOCIETY NIGHT
Salesmen and Lecturers Will Be.
Attired in Evening Clothes and
Admission Will Be Raised.
ANOTHER RECORD IS BROKEN
It was Farmers' day at the elev
enth annual Omaha motor exposition
yesterday. From Beaver Crossing
and Pumpkin Center and Old Cross
roads and every place else the rural
fcentleman came in for the show and
there wasn't a minute of rest for the
hard-working salesman for the
farmer was in on business bent.
Time was when the farmer was
facetiously referred to as a "hay
seed" by the superior city folk. Now
be is an agriculturist. The reason
for the change in the viewpoint and
the change in tho appellation was
manifestly evident at the auto show
yesterday. Every farmer who en
tered the door of the Municipal Au
ditorium yesterday had his pocket
book loaded with honest coin of the
realm. In addition he was well for
tified for emergencies with check
book and fountain pen. It anybody
had breathed "hayseed" within hear
ing of one of the auto salesmen yes-
erday he would have thought the
kaiser had brought the war. to this
country.
Struck Popular Chords.
There is no doubt that tho directors of
the Auto Show association struck a popu
lar chord when they designated Farmers'
dny. Kor the Nebraska and Iowa farmer
appreciated tho honor bestowed upon him
by Omaha and came in to the show. Hun
dreds upon hundreds of them came ex
pressly to visit tno show on their day
nnd tho percentage to make purchases
was extremely large. It is probable that
the percentage of buyers over mere sight
seers among the farmers la W per cent
greater than in any other class.
While it is, of course. Impossible to get
the absolute figures tor proof it la a safe
assertion to say that more cars were
sold Wednesday than during any other
one day in 'the history of Omaha. Every
dealer exhibited at the show re porta
many spies. One or two firms .who made
dealers'" contracts, reported total sales of
over 100 -yestordivy. Thero is but Ottle
doubt that the record of sales made yes
terday will stand up during the re
mainder of the week. Farmers' day will

a most optimistic way, although he
declared it was more difficult now
tl sn ever before to foresee the end
of the world struggle.
'The imperial government re

fited it bear a heavy responsibility

"Wo know ho It was that loose the

the German people have been the dupe
of those who thouaht the hour had come

rapine, they had cherished so long.
When dealing with an enemy like Oer-
mnny we must take thought In rood .
time how best to prevent the repetition
of the event which occurred so rapidly
plsliteen months ago. The Instinct of

"From the beginning ef the war." ha

No Dealara Swedes.
In regard to Russia's relations with
Sweden, the foreign minister said:
"Our only sentiment toward the Swedes
I one of sincere friendship. Any pre
test of conflicting Interest could only
be artificial. Russia's history doe not
Impel It toward - the coast of Scan

M. Bssonoff then turned to Roumanla,
saying: . .
"Roumanta will not betray its own in

will know how to realise it national
unity at the coat of its own blood. . It
may be certain that in defending itself
against the attempt ot a common

"The Interest which American tndutry
has In our markets," be said, "permit
of the hope that In addltloivto the
friendly political relation new existing
between the two countries an eoonomlo
rapprochement may be brought about
which ' would be of the greatest benefit

"In any case the Russian government
will put forth all lta effort to this end.'
