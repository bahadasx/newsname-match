Usefulness of Telegraphic
Money Transfer Service Increased
by Regulations.
During the last few years the Western
Union Telegraph Company has
been In the van of public service eor
poratlons in putting out new service:
to meet modern business and social
demands. The company now announces
another innovation for the
benefit of its patrons.
Thn WoQtpm TTnlnn rnmnanv an
nunlly transfers by telegraph an enor
inous amount of money and heretofore
the senders of money have not liter
permitted to include In the transfers
any communication of a business 01
personal character to the payee, stici
Information being required to be scm
by separate message. Under the new
arrangements, however, transfers between
points In the United States
may include such information and the
same will be delivered to the paves
at the time the transfer is paid. This
surely represents an up-to-date service
and one that should appeal tc
and be of much value to business
houses and the public generally
Through it, people will bcenabled tc
transmit money quickly with propel
Instructions to meet banking obligations,
pay insurance policies, guarantee
purchases, accompany bids, purchase
railroad, steamship and theater

filllo nf oil rlocpvintinna Tttnlcf* remit
tances to traveling salesmen and
nipils attending distant schools, etc.
There Is practically no limit' to the
purposes for which this service Is
available.
The telegraph company is to be
commended upon the matter in
which It is broadening the scope and
purposes of its various services In
irder to meet better the needs of
the public.

ho question from the Poor of both
louse and Scnnte.
Tho legislative sit nation In both
louses favored the ndmlitlalrutlon
orces.
Word wont to the cnpllol again
larly today that rresldout Wilson's
ipposltlon to any notion by Congress
,vtis unshaken, and thnl Chairmen
itono and Flood, of tho committees
lealing with foreign affairs, could
ixplaln his position fully. Admlnlsratlon
offlelals outside of Congress
irofessed to he undisturbed by the
igltatlon nt the enpitol nnd expressed
lonfldence that the president's poslion
would bo supported.
It was appnrent that much of the
'hating In Congress was duo to a lack
if information of the president's attitude.
One possibility which stood out
among all tho othera was that the
whole situation might be roiluced to
i proposal that Congress express the
rentlmont that Americans should not
bring their country Into danger of
war by travelling on ship# which
Germany has announced It will sink
without warning.
The extent to which the political
element enter# Into the present situation
has not been disclosed. Administration
supporters, however, recall
that. former Secretary ol Stato
BiViin broko with the president and
left the cabinet over the quditlon of
warning Americans off belligerent
ships. Among those who now are
iipportlng the agitation to put Mr.
Bryan's proposal Into legislative action
are some senators and representatives
who have been numbered
tmong Mr. Brynn's admirers, but It
Is true that some of thorn also are

Under these circumstances admlnntratlon
supporters do not sco how a

While the new submarine campaign
toes into effect 011 March 1, there are
Indications from German quarters that
the attitude of the United States is
fully understood and that the consequences
of destruction of moro American
lives Is fully realized.
In that connection the internal nitration
in Germany comes In far contldorntlon.
