PARITY HAUL RATE
GRANTED ASTORIA
Important Decision by Interstate
Commerce Commission.
PRESENT fRQGliT CHARGE IS UNFAIR
Artificial Barrier Against Columbia
River Removed New Sched
ule Takes Effect May 1.
Washington, D. C The Interstate
commerce commission Saturday ren
dered a unanimous decision sustaining
the contention of Astoria that the
oresent freight rates from the Inland
empire are discriminatory and unduly
prefer Puget Sound porta, and order
ing a readjustment, placing ine abvot
la Mtoii nn a naritv with those of Se
attle, Tacoma and Portland as to a
portion of the Inland empire, and witn
Seattle and Tacoma as to other por
tions. The decision recognizes the principle
that the railroads have been building
up an artificial barrier against the Co
lumbia river, and Indicates a recog
nition of the principle that trade
ahould move alone the line of least re
sistance for which Portland has long
contended. ' ' ' .
In summoning up Its decision the
commission says:
"A careful examination of the rec
ords makes it clear that these North
Pacific coast ports have closer' geo
graphical and economic relations, . one
to the other, than is at tnis time re
flected in the tariffs of the defendant
carriers and that the latter, in their
present rate adjustment, unduiy aia
criminate against Astoria and unduly
prefer Puget sound ports. 4
"We also conclude and find from the
record that there Is such a relationship
between Seattle, Tacoma, Astoria and
Portland as to require them to be con
sidered, forming more or lesa of a
natural rate group with respect to
much of the traffic in question.

"All facts adduced or recora oeing
fully considered, we find, that between
Aatnria and all mints in this territory
on or east of the line of the Northern
Pacific, extending from Pendleton,
Or., through Pasco and Kennewickv
Wash., to Spokane, and on or east of
the line of the Great Northern, ex
tanAinrr fmm SnnWane northward, the

rates should not exceed the rates at
the same time maintained between
Seattle, Tacoma and Portland and such
points; between Astoria and points on
the Oregon-Washington Railroad &
Navigation company east 01 renuw
n and . nninta on the Oregon Short
Line, the rates shoud not exceed the
rates at the same time maintained Be
tween' Seattle and Tacoma and such
points; as to points north of Kenne
wick and west of the competitive terri
tory just.described. Astoria rates may
exceed the Portland rates in the same
amount that Portland rates are higher
than Seattle and Tacoma rates, provid
ed'the artitraries 'over Portland shall
in no case exceed the local - rate be
tween Portland and Astoria; as to sta
tions of the Oregon-Washington Rail
road &. Navigation company and the
stations in the Spokane, Portland &
Seattle, west of Pendleton, and of the
Cascade mountains, the 'Astoria rates
may exceed Portland . rates by the
same amount that the Seattle and Ta
coma rates are higher than the Port
land rates, the differentials over Port
land in no case to exceed the local
rate between Portland and Astoria.
Incidental to possible future pro
ceedings, the commission says:
J "It does not seem unduly venture
some to assume a purpose on the part
of Portland, in case of a reduction in
the Astoria rates to the basis of rates
tn Pnowt anund Dorts. to call our at
tention at a later date to its advan
tage, over Astoria of 100 miles in dis-
tannn'frnTn Inland temmre DoihtS. to
pre'dicaie'upoh that fact a demand for
a corresponding reduction n us i own
ratea,. -;, , .-' . . .: .,
"The order of the commission , re
quires that the readjustment of the
ratsa hn maria on or before Mav. 1. and
continue' then in effect for a period of
not leBS than two years from the date
of taking effect. .

High School Lunches Prove
To Be of Greatest Value
Oregon Agricultural College, Cor-
vallis Can a high school student get
ting a lunch in the school get more
than twice the value of lunch secured
elsewhere at the same price? That
this is actually the case is shown con
clusively in a comparison of foods and
prices made by the department of do
mestic science at the Oregon Agricul
tural college. According to thia list
the following food and prices at ob
tained at the high schools, haying a
food value of 700 calories.
In a typical school lunch the follow
ing items at the prices given are pro
cured: Cocoa and whipped cream, 3c:
egg sandwich, 4c; banana, lc; four
dates, lc; 3 cookies, lc; total, 10c.
Of the usual lunches purchased else
where the following is said to be typi
cal of those bought by high school stu
dents: 3 crullers, 6c; cup of coffee
with cream and sugar, 6c; total, 10c
The food value of this latter lunch
is 260 calories, in comparison with
that of 700 calories of the typical
school lunch.
Reports from some of the schools of
Oregon where lunches are served, show
that there are other advantages con
nected with the practice of furnishing
the school lunch. It affords a means
of furnishing, instruction and training
in preparing and serving meals eco
nomically and wholesomely. It also
lends additional attraction to the work
of schools and tends to keep attend
ance and interest at the best. Teach
ers are frequently regular customers
of the school . lunch, which they find
helpful and pleasant in comparison
with the cold lunches which they
might otherwise have to eat. The
following is a typical menu or the
Kenton school of Portland:
One apple; 2 slices of bread and
butter; 2 crackers and a bowl of thick
soup. : .
Changing Conditions Compel
Cheaper Pork Production
Oregon Agricultural College, Cor-
vallis The number of recent farm sur
veys conducted by the U. S. depart
ment of Agriculture and the Oregon
Agricultural College Extension service
have clearly shown the need of more
livestock on the average Oregon farm
in order to make farming more profit
able. Notwithstanding this fact farm
ers are forced to confront the further
fact that recent pork prices have been
such that increasing the number of
pigs kept on the farm involves a seri
ous risk of loss and makes improved
methods of production imperative. The
farmers also find that on some of the
most profitable farms the number of
pigs kept is related somewhat to the
number of other livestock, especially
dairy cattle. Just how to reconcile
these somewhat conflicting require
ments is a problem that progressive
farmers are beginning to give earnest
consideration to, ' and the following
points brought out at the recent Farm
ers' Week exercises at the college may
prove of value to them :
Conditions and methods of produc
tion are already beginning to undergo
changes demanded by changing condi
tions; the quality of animals is being
increased and the number is being reg
ulated by conditions that now' exist
and which will prevail for the next
vear or so. It is pointed out by u. K
Samson, swine specialist of the col
lege, that both pure bred breeding
stock and pork hogs must be produced
more cheaply than they were five years
ago.
It also was shown that the further
fact should be taken into consideration
that some farmers can well produce
pork at ten cents, a pound but cannot
profitably produce it at six cents.
Evidentlv. then, each grower should
take into consideration the cost of
producing feed and the cost of labor in
caring for the stock. If these condi
tions axe such that he cannot make a
profit at the present prices he should
discontinue pork production" until
prices" improve, or if the economic con
ditions on his farm are such that he
can produce a fewer number with
profit, then he should confine his
efforts to the number that may be thus
grown at a profit. N While it is not
likely that the present prices will re
main as they are for any considerable
length of time, and while it is true
that there are already evidences of
better prices, it is well to accept con
ditions as they are and, as Professor
Samson says,' "cut the garment ac
cording to the cloth."
Another element in cheaper produc
tion ia a more complete combination of
fattening and growing pork which
means that no retarding must be al
lowed to occur in the growth or devel
opment from birth to marketing. Pos
sibly a slightly slower development
than has been secured with the best
Northwest
Written for this Paper
pigs is sometimes necessary, but cer
tainly a more rapid development than
that of the average must be accom
plished. During the sucking stage the
mother's milk must be more liberally
supplemented with feed which the pigs
can eat, and in addition the mother's
ration must be calculated to produce a
heavy flow of milk. If feeds'of these
sorts are not produced on the farm
and can be produced there, they should
be. And if they cannot be secured on
the farm they must be gotten else
where. Be assured that ir a pig loses
a jot in hia growth he will not make a
two-hundred pig as quickly and as
economically as if he had not," says
Professor Samson.
"At the end of the first month a
suckling should weigh about fifteen
pounds, and during the second month
he should gain about one-half pound
daily. During' the third month he
should gain about seven-tenths of a
pound daily, and during the fourth
nine-tenths of a pound daily, At five .
months he should be kept practically
on full feed and start gaining from
one to two pounds daily for sixty days.
Pigs fed in this way will finish even
and there will be very few when
brought to market that are not of the
right weight and in the right condi
tion." May Mean Establishment of
Tanneries in Northwest
University of Washington, Seattle
A ton of wood shipped by parcel
post, in fifty-pound mail bags from the
National Forest reserve near Sumpter,
Oregon, waa received at the chemistry ,
department of the university last
week. According to the parcel post
deliveryman this is the largest single
consignment that has been received by
the Seattle Postoffice.
The work will be carried on by
Frank M. Jones, a graduate student in
the chemistry department, under the
supervision of . Dr. H. K, Benson, who
was recognized at the meeting of the
American Chemical Society last sum
mer as a leader of the industrial re
search work being carried on in the
United States. '
' The Alaska furs and hides the from
Montana provide enough skins for the
establishment of tanning plants in the
Northwest, according to Mr. Jones,
but it remains for the capitalists to
be shown that the tannin extract can
be obtained from the woods of the
Northwest. When capitalists have
been shown that they can obtain the
raw material at a low cost, Mr.; Jones
believes that tanneries will be estab
lished inthe Northwest.
To Celebrate Baby Week
In Many American Cities
Washington, D. C There are 1727
communities considering some prepar
ation for Baby Week, according to the
inquiries received by the Children's
Bureau of the U. S. Department of
Labor. This number does not include '
those of whose interest in the cam
paign word has come to the bureau in
directly. The letters about Baby Week are
still coming in from evey state in the
Union and from every type of com
munity, such as a Colorado settlement
forty miles from a railroad, a club of
women on one of the government re
clamation projects, a Montana coal
mining town with a large foreign
population, at southern mill village,
and a club of 'farm women in a Middle
Western state.
Texas has its own Baby Week slo
ganBaby Health ia , Texas Wealth
and Mississippi has started a competi
tion to secure a slogan for that state.
North Dakota reports plans for a
state-wide essay contest in the public
schools. In a few state campaigns the
State Federation of Women's Clubs,
the State University Extension De
partment, the State Health officials
and those who are especially interested
in education are all co-operating in the
Baby Week campaign.
Many large cities are going to have
a Baby Week. Definite plana are
under way in Albany, Baltimore, Bos
ton, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Minneap
olis, Philadelphia, Richmond, San
Francisco, Washington and other
cities. New York had a successful
Baby Week in 1914 and will probably
hold another this . year in the late
spring.
In its suggestions' for Baby Week
observance the Children's Bureau lays
special emphasis on the opportunity it
affords for extending permanent work
for infant welfare, such as infant wel
fare stations, visiting nursing, special
nursing and instruction for prospective
mothers, city inspection of milk, spe
cial work for the prevention of blind
ness, and little. mothers' classes and
home nursing instruction for school
girls in the upper grades
