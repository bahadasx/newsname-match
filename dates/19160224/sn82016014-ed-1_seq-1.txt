Captain Kego Seizes 36 Austro
German Vessels.
Central Towers Expected to
Declare War at Once.
PORTUGAL SIDES WITH ALLIES

Towards Ententes.
Crews Ordered From Vessels;
Portuguese Flag Goes Up.
Lisbon, Feb. 24. Germany and
Austria arc expected to declare war
Immediately iipon Portugal as the re
sult of the action of the Portuguese
naial authorities. Currying out the
official tleeree. Captain Hcgo, com
mander of the Portuguese iiuval divi
sion, has seized thirty-six tiermau
and Austrian steamers, some of them
large vessels, lying in the Tagus river.
Foreign Minister Costa announced
that the vessels were confiscated be
cause PortuRal needed transports and
because of the fear that they would
escape into the Atlantic, possibly to
raid allied commerce. In support of
this statement, he stated that only
Tuesday night the German steamer
Ockenfels had escaped from the pori.
of Funchal. Maderia islands, without
clearance papers. The Portuguese
minister to German was instructed to
.call the matter to the attention of the
German foreign office.
Aided England In Africa.
Though no state of war hf. existed
between Germany and Portugal, the
Portuguese government, under the
terms of an alliance with England,
has openly sided with the allies.
Portuguese troof 8 have aided the
Knglish in operations against the Ger
mans in Africa.
It Is believed that the government's
arbillary acticn will force an imme
diate break with both Germany and
Austria officials, however, profess
' confidence that whatwr the outcome
of the affair, Spain. 8t least for the
present, will continue to preserve her
ne'itral position and Portugal's action
will not induce her to enter the war
on the side of the Austro-Germans.
Navy I-1res Salute.
Captain Hego carried out the de
cree at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
Aboard a gunboat and under the guns
of two Portuguese warships, he visited
each Austro-German vessel, gave the
crew three hours in which to disem
bark and after they had left, holwted
the Portuguese colors. As the Ger
man and Austrian sailors- were being
rowed ashore, the Portuguese warships
fired a salute of twenty-one guns.
The government's action was ex
tremely popular and crowds gathered
in the streets today, cheering before
the government buildings. Indigna
tion against the Germans have been
rising steadily since last summer when
a German I'-boat sank two Portuguese
ships. The Portuguese congress on
two separate occasions has declared it
to be the duty of the government to
declare war on Germany whenever
that action seemed necessarv.

Italian Armed Liner Gets. Wireless
Warning But Did Not Sec It.
New York. Keb. 24. The possibil
ity that a German sea raider is at
large in the North Atlantic was sug
gested when the armed Italian liner,
Giuseppe Verdi, from Italian ports,

Shapely Dames
of U. S. Big Ad
for U. S. Corsets
New York, Feb. 24. American
women are more shapely than their
sisters in Europe so much ao that the
European women took to American
corsets to enhance their charms. This
is the version of why American corset
manufacturers sell more than $r0.
000,000 worth of corsets every year
and employ more than 12,000 work
ers in this industry, told to the Cor
set Manufacturers' association by
their president. Daniel Kope, at their
convention here.
"We are selling corsets wherever
I hey are worn,' said Kope. In
achieving our success we had one help
we had never counted on the beau
tifully formed women of America.
European women, seeing their lovely
forms, adopted the same makes of
corsets."

WILL GO TO COURT
The Orient Will Ask for aj
Writ of Mandamus j
Compelling the P. U. C. to Let
It Make a Bond Issue.
Mandamus proceedings are to be
filed in the supreme court to compel
Joseph L. Bristow and the public utili
ties commission to grant a $51,941,
600 bond issue sought by the Orient
railway. The bond application was
recently denied by the state commis
sion. Twice the Orient has gone before
the commission with requests for
bond issues. Refusals of requests, it
is claimed, have blocked the reorgan
ization of the railroad and the troubles
are to be taken into the courts. Late
today, probably, the Orient will ask
the supreme court for a writ of man
damus, compelling the commission to
grant the bond request.
Several months ago the Orient
sought approval of a proposed bond
and stock issue of 71 million dollars..
Following a hearing, the state com
mission rejected the application. Re
cently the railroad filed a supple
mental petition, asking permission to
issue rlightly less than 5 2 million
dollars worth of stock and bonds. This
request went the way of the first ap
plication. It was denied by the com
mission. Xow the railroad will ask
court relief.
The Orient application includes a
request for an issue of $27,573,333 in
non-convertible preferred stock, $15,
003.600 in par value, five per cent
first mortgage gold bonds, and $9,
364,667 in common stock. It was this
petition for a stock and bond issue
which the state commission recently
refused to approve.
SILKlHRUTOPEKA
Three Hundred Tons on Special
Santa Fe Train.
Ten Steel Baggage ' Cars
$4,000,000 Cargo.
Rest at ease, girls, the war is not
going to put that silk Easter dress
out of business. Nearly 300 tons of
silk is racing through Kansas today on
its way to New York city where it will
be made up into the frocks that will
appear April 23.
The silk, which is valued at nearly
$4,000,000. fills ten of the largest rail
road cars in the world and left San
Francisco on its eastbound trip on
Washington's birthday. The cargo was
brought into this country by the
steamer I'hiyou Maru the same day it
began Its race across the continent
and was handled at the wharf in rec
ord time.
The ten cars that are carrying the
material are new steel baggage cars of
the Santa Fe railway, 70 feet long and
each with a carrying capacity of 30
tons. They are traveling in a special
train on passenger schedule and are
due to reach New York Saturday.
WILL SUE THE COUNTY
Judge MacFarland Is Denied Payment
for Work Done.
Judge MacFarland today turned
over to the county assessor a list of
estates now under probation in his
court.
The list represents exactly $393,
746.75 in taxable Shawnee county
property and means $7,467 revenue
for the county. The law. Judge Mac
Farland states, requires that the
county pay his office 10 cents each
for the names of the estates. The list
was compiled by Miss Louise Goff. At
10 cents each the charge would
amount to about $30.
When the commissioners notified
Judge MacFarlar.d that there would
bo nothing doing in so far as payinsr
for the list was concerned, the judge
stated that he would compile the list
and sue for payment and for similar
payment on two otht r lists.
"This list means about $7,467 rev
enue to the county," said the judge to
day;" and the commissioners refuse to
pay $30 legal fees for it. That la
their idea of economy."

"Human flesh is the ideal food be

New York, Feb. 24. Eighteen
steamers will compose the fleet of the
New Gaston, Williams and Wigmore,
steamship corporation organized here
to operate lines across both the At

tion o six vessels which have been
purchased for the new lines, the com
pany announces, six others unnamed
have been chartered, two others
which are being built by the Great
Lakes Engineer works, will be taken
over and four other steamers will be
built for the new corporation when
it is well under way.

business of the new line will be done
in trans-Pacific service. The Pacific
route will be run from San Francisco
to points in China, Japan and Russia.
Vladivostok will be the Russian port
of call.
Liners for Atlantic
The understanding is that most of
steamships in the Pacific service will
be freighters. In the Atlantic service
the steamer will operate between New
York and Archangel when that port is
open to navigation and it is probable
that shipments also will be made to
British and continental ports. Some
of the vessels in the service may carry
passengers.

Not Only That, but She Ate
J City's Groceries.
Topeka Official Reports Sensa

FOUR QUARTS MILK A DAY
v
This Aroused Suspicion of City
Sanitary Officers.
She Wanted Best Cuts Meat
and City Paid Bill,
That the city has been furnishing
groceries to a woman who has been
keeping a boarder and who has been
selling pies and cakes was the dis
covery made by the department of
Commissioner W. L. Porter this
morning.
Porter's first act was to cut off the
grocery supply.
His second was to notify the
boarder that he is under Quarantine,
along with the woman and her daugh
ter. Th name of the woman and that
of the boarder wore withheld by the
department but the place is located on
East Fourth strett.
"I wondered what that woman
wanted with four quarts of milk when
she gave her order for groceries yes
terday," said Clyde Tresner after Dr.
H. A. Alexander made the discovery.
Since the daughter in the family
was quarantined for diphtheria more
than two weeks ago the city has been
furnishing the woman with all her
groceries. Considering that there were
but two in the family the grocery or
ders have been lavish. Not only that,
but the woman has been a most par
ticular customer. She wanted choice
cuts of meat, the freshest of fresh
eggs and the best of everything else.
The orders wore cut down in propor
tion to the size of the family of two
after the first two or three days but
no particular investigation was made.
Finds a Strange Man.
This morning Dr. Alexander, city
physican. dropped in unexpectedly to
take a look at the diphtheria patient.
He found a strange man in the place.
The woman explained in confusion
that the man was a boarder and that
as he had paid his board in advance
she did not feel like turning him out
lar aid not xeei ukb turning mm ou
whet-the place was quarantined. Th
- Kirl is. almost ready- for release and
Dr.. Alexander did not prescribe any
rigid regulations for the boarder. But
Porter, his chief, did
An investigation was started and in
about half an hour a neighbor woman
was found who stated she had seen
people come to the door, hand the
woman money for pies and cakes and
leave.
"Is it any wonder that woman has
been asking for enough groceries to
run a hotel?" asked Porter. "If we
had given her all she asked for I sup
pose we would have been feeding
about half the people in that part of
town. If she gets any more supplies
from the city she'll get them through
some other department. I'm through.
She's had enough already for a spring
supply if she hasn't sold it."
BUY GRAIN CROP
Austro-German Syndicate Gets
Rumania Yield.
Second 100,000 Carload Con
tract Is Closed.
Milan, Feb. 24. The Bucharest
correspondent of the Socolo says that
the second contract for 100,000 car
loads of corn, oats, barley and other
cereals has been settled between the
Austro-German syndicate and Ru
mania and that it only remains to ar
range the method of payment. It is
said that the Austro-Germans have
agreed to deposit half the sum in
volved in the National Bank of Bu
charest. The delivery of 50,000 car
loads of the first contract will be
made a month earlier than was ex
pected as the Danube has not frozen
over this year.
The correspondent adds that the
Austro-Germans have also undertaken
the purchase of any surplus left over
from the 1915 crop above the 100,000
carloads mentioned and after Ru
mania's own needs are supplied. Oth
er contracts, he says, finally have been
entered into, including one for a pur
chase of locomotives in Germany. A
special committee is to draw up a list
of articles needed by Rumania which
will be exchanged against articles
needed bv Austria and Germany.
British Claim Share.
Since February, 1915, conflicting re
ports have been received regarding
contracts between purchasing com
mittees of the central empires and of
Great Britain and a committee of Ru
manian exporters for the purchase of
considerable quantities of grain. The
only definite statements made were
that British representatives had pur
chased 80.000 carloads of grain and
Germans 150,000.
The Bucharest correspondent of the
London Times said on February 21
last, that the Rumanian government
had asked parliament to pass a law
prohibiting the exportation of all ce
reals but that such law would not ef
fect the contracts just mentioned be
tween Great Britain and Germany.

many Causes Slump.

dropped from $1.244 to $1.17, loss of
7 cents.
The low point was down 10 -cents a
bushel as compared with figures that
were obtained on Monday. For the
greater part, the losses took place in

efforts on the part of holders to un

reaction but were 5 to 5 cents under
yesterday's finish, with May $1.17
and July at $1.14.
