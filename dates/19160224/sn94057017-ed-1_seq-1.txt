On last Friday the board of
county commissioners held
meeting to consider the matter of
making an appropriation for the
support of the county agent,
Petitions in favor of retention
of the county agent signed by
five or six hundred taxpayers of
the county were filed with the
board.
Pledges of money by private
taxpayers toward the support of
the agent aggregating nearly
$900 had 'been secured and was
presented to the board.
Members of the citizens' com
mittee previously appointed to
look after the matter, and a con
siderable number of interested
citizens from different parts of
the county were present and
urged the retention of the agent.
Also L. L. Johnson of Amarillo,
Texas, agricultural demonstrator
of the Santa Fe railroad, A. W.
Bickman, auditor of the N. M.
C, Capt. J. H. Toulouse of Al
buquerque, assistant state leader
in boys and girls club work, were
present lor the same purpose
The agricultural demonstrator of
the E. P. S. W. railroad could
not be here, but sent a letter to
the board urging the retention of
the county agent. Arguments
were made to the board by many
of those present in favor of re
tention. We understand that petitions
of remonstrance had been filed,
but they were not numerously
signed.
The board finally concluded
that in the present state of the
county's finances they would
risk appropriating $500 for the
ensuing year, but could not ap
propriate more.
This made it necessary to
raise the private subscriptions to
$1,000, which was done in a few
minutes among those present,
the members of the board them
selves subscribing to the fund.
The board then passed a reso
lution appropriating $500.
Hence the matter is settled,
and we retain the county agent
for the ensuing year.
It is scarcely necessary for
this paper to reiterate the belief
heretofore expressed, that this
is a good move. And we further
believe that as the end of the
next year's work approaches
there will be ample reasons to
confirm belief in the wisdom of
the action.
JAILED ON
SERIOUS CHARGES
A week ago last Sunday Mr.
Sadler, who lives near Mountain
air, found some strange horses
picketed in his pasture. He took
them to his house, and while he
was gone to the pasture to try to
find some clue as to how the
horses got there, a man appeared
at the house, told Mrs. Sadler
that he was the owner, and took
them away. A man who gives
his name as Santiago Lucero has
been arrested at Punta on charge
of stealing the horses, and has
been identified by Mrs. Sadler as
the man who t iok them away.
Lucero is also charged with hav
ing passed two forged checks
and attempting to paws another
one. Two of the checks were
for $20 each and had the name of
Saturnino Lueras attached. One
of these was cashed at the Es
tancia Savings Bank, and the
other at the Tabet store in Moun
tainair. Mr. Tabet was not in
at the time, but subsequently
another check with the name of
MriAO VIA
Torres signed was pre-
sented at the Tabet store in Man-
zano. Mr. TaDet nimseit re
ceived the check, and having ex
amined the one which had been
cashed in Mountainair, was
struck by the resemblance of the
writing in the signatures. He
told the party presenting the
check that he believed it was the
same writing, when the fellow
made an excuse to get out of the
store and decamped, leaving Mr.
Tabel in possession of the check.
Lucero came to this country sev
eral months ago, and his home is
believed to be at Roswell. The
authorities think they have the
evidence to prove him guilty of
forging the checks. He is now
in jail in Estancia.

BARRERAS HELD
TO GRAND JURY

tioned in this paper last week,

Justice Fuller at Mountainair

held to the grand jury under
bond of $1,000, which he fur
nished and was released. The
accused man stoutly asserts his
innocence. He admits that he
was in the midst of the crowd
where the shooting occurred, but
asserts that the shot which killed
Lopez came from back of where
he (Barreras) was standing.
Other witnesses swore to the
same thing, but still others swore
that they saw Barreras fire the
fatal shot. Barreras resided
nere six or seven years ago, and
bore a good reputation.
