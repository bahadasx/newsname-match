By the blasting fire of thousands of
guns, the Germans plan to wreck the
defenses of Verdun and begin a great
march on the French capital 132
miles away, Amsterdam reported.
Berlin believes the fall of Verdun
•ill signal the beginning of the end
of the war. A half million men are
now locked in the great struggle in
the woods north and norteast ci the
French fortress. The fiercest artil
lery and infantry fighting is proceed
ing on both banks of the Meuse.
^he Qernrana hare battered~in the
bead of the- strong French salient
nine miles north of the Verdun, ac
cording to Berlin dispatches today.
The Berlin war office claims the cap
ture of more than six miles of French
trenches to a depth of two miles, at
some places, the greatest gain made
by either side on the western front
since the French drive in the Cham-1
pagne last September.
If the Berlin report is true, tho
Germans are now approaching the
outer forts of Verdun and by another
equally effective drive may bring
their forty-two centimeters to bear
upon the Verdun defenses.
Paris dispatches reporting that the
battle has spread along a twenty-five
mile front, indicated today that the
Germans are pressing their attacks
with the utmost fury, counting upon
overwhelming the Verdun defenders
by the weight of their assault.
Amsterdam asserted German losses
have exceeded the casualties in any
fighting in five months. For forty
eight hours streams of dangerously
wounded have been making their way
to Germany, according to Amsterdam
leports.
A Paris dispatch to the Times, em
phasizing the importance of the Ver

German losses in the past forty-eight
hours have been so heavy as to in
sure the defeat of the attempt against
Verdun.

the vessels were confiscated because
Portugal needed transports and be
cause of fear that they would get
into the Atlantic for a posible raid
on allied vessels. It was stated that
only Tuesday night the German
steamer Ockenfels had escaped 'r°m

Without clearance papers. Th* Por-1

Though no state of war has existed

Portuguese government under the

One of War's Greatest Battles.
LONDON, Feb. 24.—Under the eye
of the kaiser, the crown prince's army
has smashed forward to within gun
range of the great fortress and city
of Verdun, in one of the greatest
battles of the war.
The German war office this after
noon announced the capture of the
villages of Brabant-Sur-Meuse, Hau
mont and the Herbe wood, within less
than eight miles of Verdun and also
the capture of Samogneux, a bare six
miles from Verdun's northern out
skirts."
The French war office admitted the
loss of Brabant-Sur-Meuse under the
Germans battering attacks and the
loss of a portion of the Caures wood,
just west of Haumont, but claimed
the repulse of a terrific German as
sault against Samogneux.
The losses on both sides probably
range well above 60,000.
Both sides reported no cessation in
the steady pounding of great guns
of all calibres along the twenty-five
mile front north of Verdun.
The French war office claimed the
repulse of heavy German onslaughts
against Samogneux and reported that
enormous losses were inflicted on the
attacking forces at Baumont north
west of Verdun. Paris also announced
a successful air raid on the Lorraine
capital of Metz.
The German war office reported not
only great gains against the French
positions around Verdun, but the cap
ture of a French advance post with
a garrison of fifty, south of Metz.
German heavy siege artillery will
be brought at once against the Ver
dun forts if the Teutons can maintain
the positions they claim they have
gained. No great anxiety is felt here,
however, over the near approach of
the crown prince's army to the fort
ress itself.
•Conceding the possibility that Ver
dun itself might be pounded to pieces,
by forty-two centimetres, English
military critics declared today that
the crown prince must pierce a re
markable system of defensive field

It is believed that the government's

confidence that whatever the outcome
of the affair. Spain at least for the
present, will continue to preserve her
neutral position and that Portugal's
course will not induce her to enter
the war on the side of the Austro
Germans.
Captain Rego carried out the de
cree at four o'clock yesterday after
noon. Aboard a gun boat and under
the guns of two Portuguese warships,
he visited each Austro-German ves
sel, gave the crews three hours in
which to disembark and after they
had left, hoisted the Portuguese col
ors. As the German and Austrian
sailorB were being rowed ashore, the
Portuguese warships boomed a salute
of twenty-one guns.

LINCOLN, Neb., Feb. 24.—An at

night, a four foot bomb enclosed in
a steel casing being exploded in a

wing.
The force of the explosion threw
the bomb from the furnace and
against a stone wall six feet distant,
but it did not explode further after
being hurled from the flames in the
incinerator. Only a portion of the
powder was exploded and it is believ
ed that if the bomb had not been
hurled out by the first explosion,
much damage might have resulted.
The force of .he explosion scattered
burning paper and rubbish about and
the incipient Are was extinguished by
Janitor Gale Harlan who had lighted
the fire and who was near the scene
of the explosion.
Mr. Harlan said that the explosion
occurred about 7:30 p. m., and that
its force seemed to shake the build

was dangerous, but soon extinguished
it with a- fire extlngutpher.
The contents of the bomb casing
were being examined during the
morning in an effort to discover their
exact nature. The portion of the
bomb which was not exploded was
filled with a dark colored powder,
Torn bits of the exploded portion
were scattered about in the inclnera

{to the port of Santa Cruz, Canary Is

scuttled the vessel and escaped in
boats, according to dispatches from

This was done, the dispatches said,
because the Spanish authorities hint

Fearing capture by British war

OVER I WAR
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24.—With a
large and clamorous faction in con
gress at odds with the president, the
administration today neared the crux
in German-American relations. The
situation was admittedly the most
critical since the dispute arose over
arming merchantmen.
Drastic measures were taken today
by the president to check tho inci
pient democratic revolt against his re
fusal to yield to Germany and warn
Americans to stay off armed mer
chantmen.
At conferences planned today with
Senator Stone, chairman of the sen
ate foreign relations committee, and
Representative Flood, chairman of
the house foreign affairs committee,
the president was expected to de
liver his ultimatum agalnBt warning
Americans to avoid armed liners.
That it will be necessary for the
president to go before congress per
sonally with a special message ask
ing congress' support in the stand
against recognizing the German de
cree, was still forecast today by men
who are with him in his fight.
Another plan under consideration to
squelch democratic "insurgents"—
those demanding that Americans be
kept off armed ships—was a letter
from Secretary of State Lansing to
Stone and Flood stating why Ameri
cans should be upheld in their rights
to travel on armed or unarmed mer
chantmen. Such a Jetter was sent by
former Secretary Bryan to Stone last
year when congress threatened to
pass resolutions stopping arms ship
ments to the allies.
Receipt of Germany's reply to this
government's representations on the
armed merchantmen issue was ex
pected today. America is practically
resigned to the belief that Germany's
response will be unsatisfactory.
ne next move, according to
authoritative information will be tho
sending of a vigorous note warning
Germany of the result if Americans
a.re endangered in the new admiralty
campaign.
Details of a clash between the pres
ident and Senator Stone in their con
ference last Monday night leaked out
today. According to congressmen
with whom Stone has since talked,
the president is said to have declared
that. Americans rights to travel on
armed ships must and will be un
equivocally sustained.

BERLIN, Feb. 24.—Ambassador
Gerard, it was strongly hinted today,
may make a speaking tour of Amer
ica in support of President Wilson's
candidacy for re-election. If the re
publicans make the Wilson submarin
ing policies tlieir chief target of at
tack.
Gerard plans to visit the United
States before the democratic national
convention in June, if he finds the
president under heavy tire by critics
of his dealings with Germany, he
may take the stump to explain a few
things about the submarine controver
sies that American people know little
about.

from the injuries he suffered early
this week while skiing near Munich.

in addition to considering campaign
ing for Wilson, Gerard expects to

killed, that will lead to war. Is ad
herence to our technical, legal rights
worth plunging this nation into war?"
Stone is said to have queried.
Tha president's reply Is said to
have been sharp and curt, approach
ing a rebuke to Stone. The presi
dent is said to have declared that if
only one American life is involved, ho
would take summary action by hand
ing passports to Ambassador Bern
storff and immediately recalling Am
bassador Gerard from Berlin. This
unyielding position from the presi
dent. widely discussed In congress
cloak rooms, is said to have caused
the movement to pass resolutions
warning Americans to stay off armed
ships.
Among the difficulties In congress
confronting the president today were
the personal convictions of both Sen
ator Stone and Chairman Flood in
favor of warning Americans off armed
ships. Both believe this should be
done rather than risk war with Ger
many. Flood and Stone both believe
a majority of their respective bodies
favor such action.
Petitions were prepared by Repre
sentative Webb of the house judiciary
committee and others asking that the
president give warning to Americans.
Administration leaders worked dili
gently to curb the opposition to the
president's pian. Dependence upon
republican votes to stave off passage
of a "warning" resolution, was the
remarkable situation they feared
might confront tho president. Repre
sentative Cooper, ranking republican
on the house foreign affairs commit
tee, was authority for the statement,
however, that many republicans favor
such a resolution. But the president's
adherents expressed firm belief today
that with republican votes the efforts
I of prominent democrats to pass sur'h
a resolution would fail. Senator Gal
linger, republican leader, Senator
Lodge, Senator Smoot. and other
prominent minority senators are said
to sustain the president's stand
against yielding to Germany. On the
house side, Republican Leader Mann
is prepared to oppose a "warning
resolution."
Those favoring a 'warning" resolu
tion declare only such action if Ger
many refuses to yield in her new
campaign, will prevent war.
On the other hand many democrats
and most republicans. It was asserted,

ing to flood America with cheap pro
ducts at the end of the war, to the
detriment of American industries. It
is understood he will urge the demo
cratic platform makers to advocate a
tariff wall at least high enough to
shut out this kind of competition. Ho
favors also a tariff commission.
If the circumstances make it. pos
sible, Gerard may give the American
public many interesting sidelights on
the submarine controversies. He may
for instance explain why Germany
thought at the beginning of negotia
tions that America was bluffing and
did not mean what she said in her
official notes.
Gerard himself tried for weeks to
impress upon German officials the
seriousness of the situation. Mean
while Ambassador Dumba was in
forming the Austrian government that
Secretary Bryan had assured him th«
1'. S. would never take strong action
against Germany ana the Austrian
government was passing this informa
tion to Berlin.
Foreign office officials told Gerard
of Bryan's alleged statement. To
add to the complications, a politician
from Illinois, carrying credentials
from Bryan, arrived here, met many
high officials and assured them that
President Wilson was writing his
notes for "home consumption."
What Gerard thought of these
moves was communicated to Col. F.
M. House on the latter's recent wiait
to Berlin.
