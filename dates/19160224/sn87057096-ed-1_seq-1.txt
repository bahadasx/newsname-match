POSTOfflCE TO
A'iS1
mOVE
Goes to North Side of Square July
1st. Ten Year Lease Made and
Republicans are Howling.
There was considerable surprise
•when Leon people read in the Regis
ter and Leader of last Sunday that
the Leon postoffice was to be moved
from the present quarters to the
room on the north side of the square
owned by Geo. \V.' Baker, and now
occupied by Keller & Pryor's millin
ery store, a ten year lease having
been signed, and the office is ^o be
moved July 1st. The news was the
more surprising from ihe fact that
under date of January 31st the
fourth assistant postmaster general
at Washington wrote to Leon parties
that no change was contemplated.
But it seems the foxy little inspector
who was recently transferred from
tnis territory got in his work before
leaving and reported to the depart
ment that the fixtures in the Leon
office were a set of old home made
fixtures and the Lord only knows
what else and quietly negotiated the
lease on the Baker building without
securing the views of the business
interests of the city and the patrons
of the office. The lease made witn
Mr. Baker provides that he shall fur
nish the fixtures for use in the office,
while heretofore every postmaster
Leon has had was compelled to buy
and furnish the fixtures for tlie post
office, but it seems that the present
postmaster was determined she would
not invest any of her money in fix
tures. There is only one consolation
In the change and that is to hear
several prominent republicans of this
city who worked with great zeal in
helping to secure the appointment of
a non-resident republican postmaster
for Leon, are now doing the loudest
howling about the change of the lo
cation. Take your medicine gentle
men, the democrats have nothing to
•do with the matter.
Trying to Remove Creston Post
master.
On the recommendation of the post
•office inspector, Postmaster W. H.
Robb has been requested bythe de
partment to resign. There is no
charge made against Mr. Robo ex
cept that of the condition of his
health, he having suffered a stroke of
apoplexy some time ago. He has
many friends in Creston where he
has been a leading democrat for
many ars who are making a fight
to retain the office for him, but a
few enemies and would-be politicians
are asking for his removal. Perhaps
Nick Reed and Dr. Reynolds have a
friend in Des Moines to whom they
want to give the office.
More New Motor Trucks.
Marvin & Stout have received a
new motor truck which they will use
for freight hauling, having the body
built by Loius Elwell, and the new
truck will be finished the coming
week. A similar truck has been pur
chased by county bridge foreman
Fred Barrett, who will use it on his
bridge work-. Several other Leon
parties are contemplating buying
similar trucks. A regular Ford car
is used with the rear axle truck at
tachment manufactured at Ottumwa.
The trucks have a carrying capacity
of about a ton.
K. of P. Minstrel Show Friday Night.
/The K. of P. boys will present
their big minstrel show at the opera

formance. Mrs. Jas. F. riarvey is
musical director and rehearsals have
been held every evening for the past
two weeks. Seats go on sale at

The county contest to select con
testants from Decatur county to at
tend the state contest to be held in
Des Moines during the State Fair
next fall and the inter-county con
test to be held at Chariton on Satur
day, March 4th, attracted a larg3
number of contestants and friend3 to
Leon last Saturday to attend the
spelling contest which was held at
the M. E. church. Practically every
township in the county was repre
sented, the contestants being limited
to pupils who were not above the
eighth grade, and a Leon boy, Asa
Barber, won first place and will reo
resent Decatur county at the state
contest. Virgil SpHfw of Morgan, won
second place, Mabel Welcher, of Da
vis City, third, Gladys Overholtzer of
Franklin, fourth, and Wilma Cart-,
wright of High Point, fifth place, and
all five will be entitled to enter the
inter-county contest at Chariton on
March 4th. Asa Barber was award

Snow a prize of $3.00.
Some Decatur County Boy Can Secure
a Free Trip to the State Fair.
One boy from each of the 99 coun
ties in ihe state will received a free
trip to the low State Fair this year
for writing an essay of not less than
500 or more than 1,000 words on
"How Good Roads Will Benefit the
Iowa Farmer." These essays must
be written and filed with the county
chairman, Miss Mabel Horner, on or
before April 1st. Immediately after
that date the county chairman will
select a local committee to judge the
essays and will forward the one
awarded first place to the Iowa De
partment of Agriculture. The con
test is limited to boys between the
ages of 15 and 19 years, and they
must live on farms, but attendance at
city High Schools will not be consid
ered a bar to competition. The boys
who won the free trip in 1912, 1913,
1914 and 1915 are not eligible to
compete this year. Miss Horner will
be glad to give any contestant full
information and we trust there will
be a large number of Decatur county
boys enter the contest this year.
Leon felectric Co. Passes to New
Owners.
The Leon Electric Co. has been
transferred to the new owners, David
G. Fisher & Co., of Davenport. Mr.
Fisher has been in Leon the past
week, with expert accountants, check
ing up the business aiid the work has
been completed and the new owners
are now in charge. Mr. Fisher states
that there will be no changes made
in the manner of conducting the
business at tne present time, but they
expect in the near- future to make a
number of improvements for- the
benefit of their patrons. He is a
very pleasant gentleman and we can
assure the patrons of the company
that they will find him a very agree
able person to do business with. The
new franchise provides for a decided
improvement in the street lighting
service which is already noticeable.
Secure Paramount Pictures.
The popular Idle Hour theatre has
closed a contract for the great Para
mount Pictures, the new service
starting on March 13 th. This is the
best film service which can be bought
and we doubt if there is another
theatre in a. town the size of Leon
which will show them regular. The
policy of toe management of the Idle
Hour theatre is that there is nothing
too good for their patrons and they
propose to give them the best there
is. The big feature "The Battle Cry
of Peace," now showing in the larg
est cities will be shown at the Idle
Hour on Friday evening, March 17 th.

LEON, IOWA, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1916.
THE LEON HIGH SCHOOL
Stands First in Number of Pupils
Enrolled In Smaller Cities and
Cost of Tuition is Least.
The facts .brought out in the fol-,
lowing data-gives Leon a most excel
lent rating as one ot the big high
schools of the state.
No other city of our size has as
many boys enrolled in high school,
and only one other city of our size
excels us in total enrollment. Of all
the cities compared, with but one ex
ception, we have a greater percentage
of our graduates for the past two
years entering college. All things
considered we hold the record in the
state for the number enrolled in our
Normal Training department.
The data for the following report
was obtained from "The Midland
Schools Teachers' Directory" and
from the "Teachers' Directory" got
ten out by-the state department.

TWENTYFIVE YEARS AGO
Items Taken from the Files of Tbe
Reporter Published a Quarter
of a Century Ago.
Elmer Brown, son of Capt. -J. D.
Brown, met with a painful accident
last Friday. He was hauling a large
log on a sled to Bright's sawmill on
George Wadsworth's place, and in go
ing down hill it rolled from the sled,
catching both his legs under it. A
gopher hill saved him from injury
except to his left foot, which was
caught and mashed from the instep
oi't, breaking the bones and dislocat
itiig the ankle. He was brought to
Leon at once and taken to Brown's
hotel, medical aid summoned, and he
is now able to be out in the office,
although it will be several months
before he can walk without the aid
of crutches.
1-lollie E. Kelley has |ecured the
appointment as court stenographer
for the district court in the 4th dis
trict, and will make his headquarters
at LeMars. This is one of the best
paying districts in the state, and is
worth about $2,000 per year. His
many friends in Leon will be pleased
to hear of his good fortune.
Dr. C. N. Ray has gone to Center
ville to take charge of a lumber yard.
Gus Blomberg and Miss Maud Hel
slier were married by Mayor Albaugh
last Saturday about noon and took
the train for the east the same after
noon. Just what point is their desti
nation is not exactly known, but it is
thought to be Chicago. Before leav
ing Gus visited a number of his
friends and borrowed various sums
from them to be paid in a few days.
But it has been since discovered that
his tailor shop is mortgaged to a
firm in Chicago for all it is worth,
and in addition he has a note out for
a goodly sum with a good man as se
curity, so it is safe to say he will not
return. A number of his Leon friends
were caught for sums ranging from
$5 to $20.
Lee Watkins, of Van Wert, was in
town yesterday. He informs us that
a new paper will soon be started at
Van vVert.
Mrs. J. A. Caster and Mrs. R. D.
Gardner went to Humeston Friday to
witness the opera "Pinafore" given
by home talent, and were well pleas
ed with it.
Conrad Sipel died at his home four
miles north of Westerville last Fri
day night.
Uncle John Phipps' 104th Birthday.
Mention was made in -The-R«port«
er last week of Uncle John Phipps at
taining his 104 th birthday, and the
following from the Shenandoah
World regarding: him will be read
with interest by his many friends in
this vicinity.
Aside from being St. Valentine's
day, today is the anniversary of the
birth of John J. Phipps. This is not
unusual, but the fact that he is 104
years old is unusual. But few are
privileged to enjoy such a ripe old
age. In addition to this Mr. Phipps
probably has the distinction of be
ing the oldest Elk in the United
States. He became a member of
that order and was initiated on his
100th birthday, the day the Elk
home of Shenandoah was dedicated,
four years ago.
*V
Mr. Phipps is a strong advocated

^!L I from
expects to vote for him next
fall. He is greatly interested in all
matters of public importance, reads
every day and keeps abreast of the
times. He gets out among the neigh
bors and visits, writes his own let
ters, and was in Shenandoah in De
cember. He could come today if it
were not for the slippery condition
of the roads and sidewalks. He is
making his home with his son, A. S.
Phipps, about 5 miles southwest of
Shenandoah.
Mr. Phipps was born in Virginia,
Feb. 14, 1812. He moved to Iowa
about 70 years ago, locating in Mon
roe county. He later moved to Mis
souri, and returned to Iowa, locating
in Fremont county about 36 years
ago. He had a twin brother who
died five years ago. He has five chil
dren living. They are Mrs. F. A.
Gardner, Leon Mrs. James Winfrey,
Stella, Neb. M. M. Phipps, Ponca,
Okla. and A. S. Phipps with whom
he makes his home. He also has 25
grandchildren and 48 great-grand
children living. His wife has been
dead now for 10 years. One of the
things Mr. Phipps says he has never
done is to use tobacco in any form.
May his birthdays multiply.
