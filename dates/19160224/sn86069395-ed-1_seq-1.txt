MEMPHIS HAS
4 MAYORS
IN 4 HOURS
Memphis Still Wrestling With
The Municipal Problem.
NEWSPAPER MAN NOW IN
Thomas C. Ashcroft Is Elected
Mayor of Memphis By The
Commission.
Memphis, Tenn., Feb. 23. Reor
ganization of the Memphis municipal
commission Tuesday gave the city
four mayors within as many hours
and finally the erection of Thomas C.
Ashcroft, capitalist arid former news
paper man, as the head of the city
government 'to serve the unexpired
term of Edward H. Crump, which
will end in 1920.
Crump, ousted from office last No
vember on his.tcchnical admission of
failure to enforce the prohibition and
other state laws, and prevented from
assuming office for a new term which
began January 1, pending a supreme
court decision, was installed in office
as mayor at the morning session of
the commission, relieving W. T. Mc-
Lain. Crump immediately resigned
and R. A. Utley, who had been in
stalled as vice-mayor, assumed the
position vacated by Crump. Utley's
tenure was short, however, and while
papers in ouster proceeding against
him were being prepared, he tendered
his resignation at the-afternoon ses
sion pjjjhe commissioners and Ash
croft was elected.
Utley was a co-defendant with
Crump in the ouster suit last Novem
ber and had been prevented from
assuming office for a new term Janu
ary 1 owing to the same conditions
which held in the Grump case. The
supreme court decision, handed down
ten days ago, held that Crump and
Utley were entitled to take office for
the new terms but in another case,
held that failure to enforce the laws
during a previous term might be made
he basis for new ouster proceedings.
In view of this 'ruling Crump and
Utley retired.

Paris, Tenn., Feb. 23. Tom Barr,
negro held an suspicion in connec
tion with the disappearance of Josie
Pryor, negress, a week ago, made a
written confession Saturday after
noon and then hanged himself in his
cell at the county jail, following the
finding of tho' woman's body buried
beneath a pile of manure in the rear
of the barn of Sam Love, alb
colored, on Brewer Street How
ever, doctors brought Barr back to
consciousness and there is talk of
mob violence on the part of the col
ored populace.
MANY SUITS
AGAINST CITY
Property Owners on Howe
Street Take Grievance
Into Court.
A largo number of damage suits
have been brought by Cook & Fruit,
12 in all, against the City of Hopkins
ville, the plaintiffs being people living
along tho watercourse known as Howe
street. The street was originally a
ravino conducting thedrainage of a
large territory into the sowers west of
tho railroad. Years ago it was mado
into an open sower with a bottom of
cobble-stones and in time colored
people bought lots and built houses
fronting on this gully, dry most of
tho time but fh wet weather filled
with water. Several months ago tho
former council undertook to better
conditions on tho street and the pe
titions set up that this was done in
such a manner that abutting property
was heavily damaged thereby, and re
imbursement for this damage was
prayed for,

Joab Harned, a farmer, 55 years

suicide Monday afternoon at five

not deep enough to cause death. Dr.

from which he had only been back a
week, was summoned and attended
the wounded man. Unless complica
tions ensue it is expected he will re
cover. He was at the home of his brother,
John M. Harned. He was in an ad

brother and his wife were sitting and
called to them, "I've been wanting to
die for some time and have a good

Kentucky State Agent of Poultry Club
work, assigned to this state by the
Department of Agriculture, at Wash
ington, in his talk to the Christian
County Poultry Improvement Asso
ciation at the H. B. M. A. Monday I
night said he was glad the time had
come when he could take up his
work in this famous county, where
co-operation was the password and
where the great Pennyroyal Fair was
held. Speaking of the outlook for
his work here he said that there
seemed to him to be no reason why
the plans made by the Improvement
Association could not be carried out,
although they were different from
any plans he had ever handled, this
county being the first one in the
United States to take up community
breeding, and at the same time stand
ardize the product by selecting one
breed of fowls to be used in the Boys
and Girls Club work, as well as the
work with adult 'farmers under the
supervision of the County Agricultu: -al
Agent. He said that Christian
county would be hatched closely by
the Department at Washington and all
aid at their command given throng!
him, and' that he would come to
Christian county for a week's stay
every other month, assisting Mrs. C.
E. Graves with the club work.
Mr. Chapin thoroughly understands,
not only his work but how to tell
others the exact thing to do and by
the use of large illustrations of White
Wyaudottes made a most interesting
and instructive talk about poultry
breeding and management
Mrs. C. E. Graves, County Demon
strator, made an interesting and in
structive talk along the line of co
operation and especially in the
marketing of eggs, giving a history
of results in other states.
County Agriculturalist A. M. Casey,
who has supervision aver the poultry
work with adult farmers, also spoke
ofhis work and reported a .number
of farmers interested and inquiring
for eggs and he is much encouraged,
for he is a great advocate of commun
ity breeding.
Treas. J. W, Stowe reported that
he would place orders this week for
eggs and requested tbat all who wish
j eggs for hatching send check for $1.00
tor each setting with order at once.

Prof. Foster is very much interest

London, Feb 23. The Italians; af

have captured the mountainous rninon
of Callo in the Sugana valley and' also
have occupied the towns of RoncBgnO'

By their new acquisition of terri

of Trent which lies, protected on
the north, cast and south by a hn o!
forts, fifteen miles west of the cap
tured region.
igain there lias been vicious fight
ing in the Artois region of Franco, in
Champagne and along both banks, of
the Mouse above Dun. To the- east
of Souchez, after a heavy bombard
ment, the Germans attacked and cap
tured 800 meters of French trenches
and took seven officers and 319 men
prisoners.
So powerful was the attack that the
Germans, seven battalions- strong,
not alone occupied first line trenches,
but at points gained excess to some of
the communicating trenches.
The French by a counter attack, it
is officially announced by Paris, suc
ceeded in driving out the Gentians
from all but a few of these positions,
the Germans suffering heavy casual
ties.
At Brabant-Sur-Mduse, the Ger
mans also broke into the French
trenches but here again they were
driven out and back to- their original
positions.
There is no change in the situation
along the front in Russia and Galicia-
The Russians arc still pressing1 the
Turks hard in Armenia. Constanti

concerning the reverse to the Turkish
arms at Erzerum, says the retirement

positions to the east of Erzerum and
also fifty old cannon which they could
not take with them. Denial is m tiic
that the Russians captured 1,000 ciu
