A Great Republican
Meeting.
Ihe first annual banquet of th
Willis-Harding Club of Darke
- county, held at the New Arrr.ory
Wednesday night of last week,
was attended by a large gather
ing of enthusiastic Republicans
At the banquet table were seated
three hundred and thirty people
while many othtrs dropped in la
ter on to hear the addresses by
the Club's distinguished guest?,
who were Governor Willis, Hon.
Harry M. Daugherty, Hon. W.
L. Parmenter of Lima. 0.. and
Hon. 0. E. Harrison of Colum
bus, a former citizen of our town
and at one time ably represent
ing Darke county in the State
Senate. Prosecuting Attorney
George Porter was toast-master
and ably filled tnis position. The
banquet wa3 first on the pro
gram, and was a most elaborate
one, highly enjoyed by all par
ticipating in it. Following the
Banquet came the speaking, the
speakers being introduced by Mr.
. .Porter in a few well-chosen and
appropriate remarks. Governor
Willis being first on the program.
What this distinguished guest did
to his predecessor was a plenty,
as well as to other "pennyroyal
politicians'' over the state. And
he talked from the records, hav-
. jng the acts and figures before
him, gleaned from a safe full of
them left in the governor office
by the Cox administration and
which the Governor intends go
ing through at his leisure and in
which be finds much pleasure and
amusement. He also had the rec
ords of the State Treasurer's of
fice to refer to and to back up his
statements. He simply showed
up Cox's complete failure to sub
stantiate the charges he (Cox)
has been making of late against
the Willis administration. He
dwelt principally upon the Work
men's compensation act, the pub
lic highway department and tax
ation matters, showing conclus
ively that the charges of Cox and
other ' 'pin head" politicians were
" mere bluster and far without the
pale of facts of record. He was
frequently interrupted by enthus
iastic and prolonged applause.
He demonstrated to the satisfac
tion of all his hearers that the
campaign pledges of the Repub
lican party had been kept, ; men
tioning especially the repeal of
the Warnes law and the restora
tion of the taxing authority to
the people, and challenged Cox
or any others of the Cox party to
show wherein Republican cam
paign pledges had not been kept.
He dwelt but briefly on national
issues, confining his talk princi
pally to state issues, but endorsed
a protective tariff and severely
arraigned the President's war tax
in times of peace and his income
tax when we had no incomes.
He concluded his excellent talk
by saying, "We are big enough
to protect American citizens
wherever they may be. Let us
re-dedicate the Republican party
. and the Republic to the princi
ples of Lincoln, Garfield and Mc-
Kinley and usher in an era of e
conomy and efficiency in office and
of prosperity and progress to the
nation."
The Governor was followed by
Hon. Harry M. Daugherty, can
didate for United States Senator
to succeed Hon. Theodore E. Bur
ton, and spoke in part as follows
I have spent most of my life
in the agricultural districts of the
state, I lived in a country in my
boyhood, and until my late man
hood, that was developed from
the black swamp. I know the
predominating interest in your
locality and have .seen the mar
velous growth of your county in
business and agricultural pur
suits, and the thrift productive
of both. What the agricultura
interests of the country want and
need and what they are entitled
to is liberal state and federal aid
or the improvement of agricul
tural interests and the construc
tion of good roads. The expen
diture of public money for the
maintenance of agricultural ex
periment stations, the employ'
ment of county farm agents and
the propagation and distribution
of high-class seeds and plants, as
well as the prevention and cure
of disease in stock and cattle, is
proper and justifiable
I congratulate the farmers of
Darke county on the fact that it
is the banner com county of . the
state, and the farmer in the coun
ty that has an acre of ground
that will produce 150 bushels of
corn will understand the import
ance and the profit of a method
that will increase the production
of corn, tobacco or other products
of the farm.
The construction of good roads
not only furnishes a means of ex
peditiously reaching the market
with the product of the farm, but
they will add to the pleasure and
comfort of farm life, bring the
city closer to the farm and be the
means of building up civic cen
ters and developing social life
and make more wholesome and
attractive to the rising genera
tion the work in the meadow, the
forest and the field which, I am
sorry to say, in the last fifteen
years has been less attractive to
the youth than the alluring lights
of the noisy city.
I congratulate the citizens of
your county that you propose
building a splendid paved roada
cross your county marking the
trail of General "Mad Anthony"
Wayne. The roads marking this
course should be made main
market roads and the enterprise
that proposes to build this splen
did monument to that herb of
many Indian battles, who con
cluded in this city a lasting peace
that opened up the great rich and
fertile Northwest to settlement,
should receive such aid from the
state of Ohio, that the roads of a
like character are receiving in
other parts of the state,
When this unfortunate war is
over the preparedness we will
most need will be in connection
with our business industries an
internal preparation , chat w ill
meet the invasion of our shores
and our business industries, and
preserve and protect the product
of the workmen in the mills, the
capitalist in the counting house,
the farmer behind the plow, and
the consumer throughout the
broad land.
The greatest preparedness nec
essary is that which will enable
us to meet the situation that wil
be crowded upon us industrially
when the war ends; when the
sword is" bheathed, the cannon
silenced ; when the submarine is
sunk and the air craft comes to
earth again; when the lame and
the halt return from the trenches
and battlefields to industrial pur
suits in the unfortunate lands
now engaged in war," and are
compelled to meet the taxes and
charges against them, to build up
their private fortunes and again
put a roof over heir heads, they
will be compelled to work in field
and factory cheaper than they
ever worked before, and they
will be compelled to send their
product to America, because, con
sidering the exigencies of the sit
uation, we will have become the
money storehouse of the world.
Then is when we will need one
protection which no other plan
can afford, that is, the protection
afforded by a protective tariff
aw, constructed on the lines for
which McKinley stood and upon
which the government has been
founded and progressed.
I am in favor of a tariff com
mission. The Kepublican party,
under a Republican president,
provided for a tariff commission.
he Democratic party destroyed
it. They nov speak up in favor
of a tariff commission. I agree
with them that a tariff commis
sion is useful, if that commission
is in sympathy with a protective
tariff plan, but I have no interest
or faith in a tariff commission ap
pointed by a Democratic presi
dent whose sympathies are for
ree trade. Their advocacy of a
tariff commission i3 a subterfuge,
and no beneficial results will come
from the installation under a
Democratic administration of a
tariff commission predisposed to
ree trade and prejudiced against
he protective tariff doctrine.
I want to see a Republican ad
ministration at Washington in
stall a fair-minded tariff commis
sion that will gather facts upon
which tariff legislation can be en
acted that will protect our indus
tries, our capital and labor, when
we are compelled to resist an in
vasion industrially as we inevita-
bly will when the curtain falls
and the last battle is fought
Mr. Daugherty was followed
by Hon. W. L, Parmenter and
Hon, 0. E. Harrison;, each of
whom made short addresses, as
the hour wa3 getting late, but
each was warmly applauded upon
their terse and to-the-point re
marks upon local, state and na
tional issues. '
Telegrams were read by Mr.
Porter from Hon. James I. All
read and Hon. A. R. Garvar, ex
pressing their regrets in not be.
ing able to be present owing to
other pressing matters.
Altogether, it was a most splen
did meeting, one that augurs
well for the Republican party of
the state and county and the re
sult will surely be conclusively
shown at the November election
for the good of the party ticket
in county, state and nation.

Bible Reading and
Crops.
In his address on "Across the
Himalayas to the Unexplored De
sert of Lop," Dr. Ellsworth Hunt
ington, the explorer, pointed out
the difficulty of the people living
in the regions of the Himalaya
mountains and Thibet to make r,
iving. He' said :
"Passing into Tnibet we found
the people at work in the fields.
It is their belief that if they do
not have some one reading the
Bible while the crops are bung
planted, the crops will not grow.
In spite of the hard conditions
under which they are laboring,
the people are cheerful."
The explorer said that every
where he was received with the
greatest kindnes, and that the
native regards the foreigner as
having extraordinary power.

Mary, wife of Henry G. Bang.
died last Friday morning in their
home here, to which they moved
the Monday previous. Taking
sick, that day, the end came
speedily from heart trouble, with
which she had been a sufferer
fcr years. She died at the age
of 63 years and leaves surviving
her an aged husband, two sons
and three daughters, many grand
children and a large circle of
frimds. Funeral services were
held at Harris Creek church, con
ducted by Rev. Eikenberry, and
interment in the cemetery neai
by. A short service was con
ducted in the home by Rev. Carr
of our Presbyterian church be
fore starting to the Harris Creek
church. Having recently purch
ased their home in this place and
moved into it, they planned a life
of comfort and pleasure, but
death intervening, brought only
qloom and sadness for the be
reaved husband, who is left alone
on the shores of time. He shares
the sympathy of s.,ur entire com
munity. The revival in nrogress in our
retbyterian church, under Rev.
Dunlop and wife, for the last
three weks, closed last nfcht
with about one hundred convert",
twentyfive of whom were taken
into our M. E. church and fifty-
one into the Presbyterian church.
There are still some who will
unite with one. or other of our
two churches or some other church
of their preference. This revival
has been the means of a great
change among the people of our
vicinity, but more especially a
mong the people of New Harri
son, who were converted almost
en masse and taken into the Pres-
bvterian church, and are of such
number as to be sufficient to start
a new church, and why not?
Many years ago that place had
and supported a church when the
membership was no greater than
the number it has now. Presuin
ably this revival among its peo
ple will hardly ripen into the
erection of a new church build
ing, but it will doubtless be pro
ductive of a Sunday school w;th-
in their village limits ; and it is
hoped that a branch of Israel will
find a Joshua among their num
ber to lead them on to victory
and a home in the promised land
and to do service in the vineyard
of the Lord. Surely, among them
wi'l be fouiid a person equal to
the emergency. But if it should
