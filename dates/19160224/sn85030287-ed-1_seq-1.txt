"Let Him Who is Without
Sin Cast The First Stone"
. In ourpersual of a current is
' , sue of the official organ of the
'JAMeade High School, "The Tat-
tier" our attention was attracted
by, certaio- articles relative to
law enforcement and the seem
, ing indifference manifested by
'.' the local merchants of our city
in complying with the law.
While we heartily commend
this assid uous investigation, on
the other hand we greatly de
plore the seeming inconsistency
of tne person whom all indica
tions point to as the prime in
stigator of this intended reform.
. He seems to be imbued with the
hallucination that he is a Kaiser
Wilbelni and can coerce the pub
. lie into his aberratic view of law
enforcement, in that he repri
mands some for their non obser
V vance of laws, which he consid
' ers vital to community interests,
- and on the other band, in amas
ing msipidy he countenances and
, ; 'ven perticipates in flagrant vio
Vlatiwiis of tbe law -i.; X- -
'Accordingly we wish to quote
for this person's, edification
Chap. 198, Sec. 8 of the laws of
" Kansas of 1911.' -
"No person shall shoot, hunC
trap, or take in any manner any
game birdVir animal during any
portion of the year without first
.having in his possession a license,
-issued to" himself, as hereinafter
provided, for the fiscal year in
which such shooting or hunting
is done. Etc., Etc."
Also Sec. 37 of the, same Chap
ter; "For the violation of any of
the provisions of this act, the fol
lowing penalties shall be impos
- ed.:. Unless otherwise provided
herein for the first offense, a fine
, " of not less than Five dollars nor
more than twenty-five dollars;
for the .second off ence, a fine of
not less than fifty dollars nor
S '.more than two hundred dollars;
; 'for the third and each subse
queiit ofrence, a fine not less than
one hundred dollars nor more
than five' hundred dollars, and
shall be ad judged to pay the cost
of the prosecution," and shall be
committed to the jail of the coun
ty in which the offense was com
mitted until such cost and fine
shall be paid."
While we do not harbour any
resentment toward the person
toward
whom we suspect to be
insliga-
' tor of the aforesaid article, jyet
we
sincerely anticipate newill

. "Such" Makes Difference
Cbanute, Kans., Feb. 15 The
word "such" in the law making
the sale of tobacco to minors a
misdemeanor brought about the
acquittal of F. C. Alexander, of
this city, against whom a charge
of the kind had been brought.
Judge James W, Finley of the
Neosha county district court in
structed the jury to bring in a
verdict of not guilty, bis ruling
establishing an important inter
pretation of the law.
The act makes it a misdemean
or for a minor to use "tobacco in
any form on any public road,
street, alley, park or other lands
used for public purposes or in
auy public place of business."
The next section declares that
eyery person who shall furnish
tobacco to "such" minor commits
a misdeamor.
Attorneys for Mr. Alexander i
raised the point that ev.dence i

Departed
Ruby Esther, the seven-year
old daughter of Reverend and
Mrs. C. J. Spires, died at , the
Baptist parsonage last Saturday
morning, after a week's illness.
Little Ruby was physically
weak from birth and when learn
ing to walk an attack of typhoid
pneumonia left her almost help
less. Two years later a second
attack further weakened her,
and when the third attack came
the patient little sufferer was not
strong enough to recover and
death came to relieve ber. With
all her sickness she was always
cheerful and possessed an active,
intelligent mind.
At the close of the Sunday
school last Sunday the members
of the Primary department with
their teacher, marched to the
parsonage where they paid their
last tribute, of respect to their
departed class mate.
A short service was conduct

The condition of the wheat, in
general, is good and is starting
off nicely. Some of the later
sowing seems to be a little thin.
While we have had no moisture
to speak of this winter, the wheat
jdoes not seem to be suffering,
j and seems to be sufficiently well
rooted to prevent blowing out.
From some of the unearthly
j noises heard in different parts
l0f tue cjty Wednesday night,
one might be tempted to guess a
, band ot .;0m manches responsi
ble, but when morning dawned
and the colors of the Juniors and
Freshmen Hated from the First
National Bank flag pole and also
from the pole at the school house
the cause for the noise was . ex
plained. , The boys guarded the
colors all night and at sunrise
the band played a popular air, in
defiance to the Soph mores and
the seniors that their "nag- was
still there."

Last Sunday evening a union
meeting was held at the M. E.
Church, and Mr. Harry Lyon
Brenner, of St. Louis, addressed
the gathering. Mr. Brenner has
been in the city for the past few
days in the interest of the Gow
dowsky Progressive Conserva
tory course in music which has
recently been adopted in the
Meade school. Mr. 1-frenner
made an excellent address, which
had no connection whatever with
the work he is representing in
a musical way. His discourse
was reasonable and to the point,
and has called forth much favor

The Nellie Byers Case
' i ' ,
It seems that the Nellie Byers
murder case is still unsolved.
Last Thursday evening a rumor
reached this city that Bert Drake
a neighbor and old time school
friend of Miss Byers, who is at
present clerk of the district
court of Grant c5unty, had made
a confession in which he claimed
to have committed the murder in
conjunction with Archie Sweet.
The rumor spread rapidly over
town and it was further report
ed that Drake had been brought
to Dodge City apd lodged in jail.
Inquiry at the sheriff's office
soon revealed tnat tue whole re
port was ficticious and absolute
ly without foundation. Notwith
standing this fact however, sev
eral of the dailiy newspapers on
the following day published the
sensational story.
Investigation shows that no
new clew has been developed and
that the whole horrible crime is
just as mysterious now as when
the dead body of the unfortunate
Miss Byers was discovered on
the prairie the morning after her
disappearance..
In the mean time Archie Sweet
is still in the Dodge City jail and
from all accounts no new evidence
has been unearthed. Every
thing so far reported in the de
velopments of the case is wholly
fictitious and evidently the Grant
county authorities know no more
about the crime than they did a
few days after its' perpetration.
The next regular term of the
district court in Grant county
convenes in April and unless
Sweet asks for a change of venue
the case must be tried in that
county. Under the law the state
cannot ask for a change of venue
as the Kansas law provides that
criminal cases must be tried in!
the county in which the crime
was committed unless the accus
ed yisks for a irial in another
cotinty lor thr reason that pre
judice nay prevent a fair and
i in partial trial of the case. Sweet
hns not yet employed an attor-r.-.-,'

It w:tm to he the prcvelent

:h.:. th? wbolvnatter has been

trial than the' pubic generally
knows, it will bea hard job to '

cumstances arc damaging there

We have been reliably inform
ed that the letters said to have
been received by a professional
person in Wichita, came from a
Miss Byers in Oklahoma. This
information clears that part of
the story which appeared in sev

it also removes all suspicion re.
garding the character of Nellie
