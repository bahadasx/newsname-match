NEW CRISIS
WITH KAISER
Otl HORIZON
Controversy Over
Unarmed Ships
Is Grave
CONGRESS STIRRED
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.
Agitation in congress for
action warning Ameri
cans off armed Bhips of the Eu
ropean belligerents, suddenly
grew to such proportions today
that Democrats of the foreign
affairs voted to canvass the sen
timent of the house on several
pending resolutions of that na
' ture.
Sentiment in the senate in favor
of some such action also was
openly expressed, but at the end
of a day of surprises tension and
agitation such as has not been
seen in congress in some time,
the word came that President
Wilson still was unalterably op
posed to any such, action by con
gress and believed that he would
only be embarrassed thereby in
the negotiations with Germany.
To widely circulated sugges
tions that the situation had
reached a point where the pres
ident soon would lay it, before
congress, that Secretary Lansin
might in some way define the at
titude of the government in
communication to Senator Stone,
and that a time had been fixed
within which the United States
would expect Germany to signify
her intention to abandon the an
nounced intention to sink armed
merchant ships without warning,
the uniform statement was mada
officially that nothing had been
determined upon, that the situa
tion, though grave, still was
awaiting one and that no final
position would be announced un
til Berlin was heard from.
The sudden developments at
the capital brought surprise and
apprehension to the administra
tion leaders. While confronted
with the possibility of congres
sional interference with all its
grave aspects ranging from a de
fection from the administration
policy to downright embarrass
ment of the president and the
. secretary of state, the leaders
were confident they would con
trol the situation and leave the
executive branch of the govern
ment free to carry on diplomatic
negotiations with Germany.
At no time today did the question
come out openly on the floor, either
of the house of the senate, hut about
a score of congressmen who an
nounced they were it) favor of warn
ing Americans, even if it involved a
repudiation of the administration
policy, if thereby they thought tho
war would lie averted, kept hoth
houses In a state of tension that prac
tically Mocked htisinesa.
All the demonstration was in the
Pomocrutie ranks and there was no
open show of sentiment anions; the
Republicans. It was Indicated, how
ever that Republican Leuder Mann
sympathized with l'resident Wilson's
policy and that any outbreak would
have to reckon with his forces.
From apparently authentic sources
came statements tonight that the
president was determined that the dis
pute pending with Germany be Bet
tied without prolonged negotiations.
He is known to believe, however,
that the breaking off of diplomatic
relations with Germany Means war and
there will be no undue haste In han
dling: the situation Involving such a
possibility.
The administration view is that a
broad and important principle is In.
voved In the right of American's to
travel on nelHjrerent merchantmen
and that thin right must not he aban
doned. Developments f.re expected momen
tarily. Tomorrow tnuy bring Ger
many's reply to the request of the
United States made last week through
Anibassiri-jr von Iiernstorff for as
surances th.it the notices to sink
armed Merchantmen after February
29 dot not nullify previous pledges
Klven in the Arabic and I.usilania
negotiations. Official advices from
Herlln have Indicated that Germany
will reply that previous nssurunces
will not be af'ected, but that they up
plied only to unarmed ships and
probably will ask tho American gov
ernment for its definition of defen
sive armaiiunt which may be car
ried by a inercl.il ntman without sua
liflcln its peaceful character.
Fake Telephone Message Tracked
Straight to Harris1 Headquarters
Used Name of Eugene Lorton in an Offer to
Uribe Beckham County Delegation.
OKLAHOMA CITY, Feb. 2:1. The fake tcle-ilion.' cull
alleged to have been put in at Oklahoma City from Eugene
Lorton to Fred Livingston at Sayrc between 8 and !)
o'clock Monday night, in which the offer was made to
bribe the Beckham county delegation to vote for Jim
McGraw. was 1 raced straight into the headquarters of Jini
Harris tonight, when Mr. Livingston arrived here and the
telephone records were turned over to him. The call was
placed in the name of Jim Harris himself and was charged
to Walnut 1077, the phone number at Harris' headquarters
at the Skirvin hotel in Oklahoma City.
It is one of the clumsiest as well as one of the most des
picable pieces of political trickery ever uncovered in tlt.
state and exposes the tlirty methods being resorted to by
the Harris forces in order to defeat McUraw. Mr. Living
ston was in McGraw headquarters tonight and now that, he
understands the scurrilous job that was attempted to be
put up on him will stand by McGraw to the last ditch in
the district congressional convention to meet' at Unhurt
Saturday.
When the trick was exposed today Harris supporter
endeavored to make it .appear that no such conversation
took place, but when the telephone records exposed that
the call for Mr. Livingston was made from Harris' head
quarters, they did not attempt to refute his charges. The
question being asked now is were they Irying to buy the
Beckham county delegation and were merely using tho
name of Lorton and McGraw to ascertain if a deal was
possible. The incident lias left an ugly taste in the mouths
of decent Republicans throughout the state who now
realize that there are no ends to which the Harris sup
porters will not go in order to win.

BRITISH BLOCKADE
TOO LONG DELAYED
Sh'ciIIkIi I "res ami UiinIiicss Men Say
(ierman.v Hum I'lcnty of Sup
plies to Last Two Years
STOCKHOLM, Bwed"n, Feb. 23.
The British blockade of Germany has
failed because It came too lute, ac
cording to the Swedish press und
Swedish business men.
As far as Sweden and the other
Scandinavian countries are concerned
the blockade only became really ef
fective lust April. For eight months
prior to thut time, or since the very
Mart of the war the Germans, antici
pating England's tactics, were pur
chasing enormous quantities of mili
tary supplies, especially copper, anti
mony and tin, through Sweden, Den
murk and Norway, Importers hero are
convinced thut by the time the block
ade was perfected Germany had
stored up such quantities of these and
other war materials us to meet all her
needs for possibly two years. The
claims made by the Kritish govern
ment that great quantities of war iva
terial have been smuggled into Ger
many through Sweden are bitterly re
sented by Swedish merchants.
An opinion frequently expressed
here Is that as far us the Scandinav
ian countries are concerned, Eng
land has only succeeded In creating
ill feeling among; the neutral by her
blockade without seriously injuring
Germany.

There hud been vry heavy fight

within the last few days the attacks
of the Germans have taken on added

east, with Verdun In the center only
a f'v miles southward.
Tho Germans claim to have made
Important advances, anil to some ex
tent these are admitted by the French
war office, which describes the but
tle ns one of Increasing Intensity.
The German preparations were ex
tensive and the bombardment of tho
French positions with thousands of
shells was uninterrupted. As the
French had foreseen this buttle all
their available guns were called Into
action and responded in kind to the
heavy shelling of the Germans.

While at some Points the French
were unable to resist the onslaught
of the attacking forces, along much
of the front, according to the I'tirls
communication, the attacks were well
sustained und very heavy losses were
Inflicted on the Germans.

ing the possibility of peace, reiterated
his former pronouncement that there
would be no peace until conditions

included the restoration of I'.elgltim
and Serbia and the overthrow of
"Prussian militarism."
While President Wilson is declared
to be unalterably oposed to any ac
tion by congress with respect to warn
ing Americans off armed merchant
men of the belligerent nations of
Europe, agitation in congress in this
direction has grown to marked pro
portions and Washington advices say

the sentiment of the house on several
pending resolutions bearing on that
question.

Improved Defense of Pa

Urgent Demands.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23. Inter
noilioiiul considerations which
moved the -lavy general board tu
change its time-honored policy last
year and declare that the United
States navy should equal tile strong
est afloat by lo t later than 1!2 will
be disclosed to tho house military
committee t imoirow In executive ses
sion by Rear Admiral Charles J.
Hudger. a member of the board.
Examination of Admiral lladger in
open session was concluded today, the
admiral consistently refusing to dis
cuss except beh. ml closed doors the
hoard's views ol dangers thut may
confront tlie nation.
The subject came up when Repre
senatlve Stephens of California,
seeking to show that the Pacific
const wus Inadequately defended,
asked If tho houid iu altering Its pol
icy did not have is mind the possibil
ity that the country might have to
face simultaneously enemies In the
Pacific nnd Atlantic oceans. Admiral
lladger said he could answer thut
only In executive session. He ex
plained, however, that a fleet cupuhln
of dominating the Pacific ocean was
the only sure pn tectlon for the Pa
cific coast and said that the eurth
slides In the Piirama canal had made
impossible for the present, and pos
sibly for unotber year, the use of the
fleet in either ocean. Further dis
cussion of the canal closure also was
deferred to the closed session.
About (,rcat llritaln.
Admiral Padger expressed the
opinion tiiat should the United
States adopt a two-power standard
navy such as recommended by the
general board. Great lirltuin would
not ultcr her rate of construction ut
least until the gap between the two
fleets had been materially reduced.
Earlier in 'us teitlmony he had suid
he did not consider war with Great
lirltuin even u ninote possibility.
Replying to a question by Repre
sentative Calloway, the admiral said
that in framing the IliSu.UOO.uuO
building program It first proposed un
der its new policy, the board hud been
going on the theory thut It wus neces
sary to get as many big ships us pos
sible added to the fleet in the shortest
time the country's building facilities
would permit.
"Do you tblnl! we have Ihe name
reason tor desiring supremacy of tho
sea that England hus?" Representa
tive Calloway usked.
"Not at present, perhaps," the wit
ness replied, "but eventually wo would
have to reach out for our share of
world trade and anybody who stood
in the way of our getting a fair deul
would have to be deall with."
Admiral Haducr repudiated a sug
gestion that military men viewed ull
international problems from tho
standpoint of force, while statesmen
looked upon force and diplomacy as
equal arms of government.
"Ultimately, however," he added,
"diplomacy depends on force. When
diplomacy fails it must cither aband
on its object, or call .on the force."

geneial board had not made a rec
