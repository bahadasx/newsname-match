ffllö JURORS
COMPLETE TASK
Bring in 131 Indictments.
About 40 People Thought
to be Concerned.
One. hundred and thirty-ono secret
indictments were returned by the
grand jury in circuit court Thurs
day afternoon.
This rumber included, it Is sup
posed, hot only the bound over cases
which were sent to the Krand Jury
from the city court, but are the re
sults of the city wide anti-vice cru
sade conducted under the super
vision of Mayor Keller's sleuths.
For three weeks the Krand jurors
have been sitting with Pros. Chester
11. Montgomery. Speculation as to
the number of people involved In
the investigations has been rife, but
It actually believed that only about
4 0 people are actually concerned.
Xo word ha-s officially been Kiven
out as to the character of the in
dictments nor any of the parties w ho
wer implic-ated.
That the majority of the indict
ments are directed against law vio
lators, such as keepers of pamblinR
houses, so-called red liirht resorts,
and the like, is the prevailing- belief.
Sprcial Investigator Charles Plbler,
who together with Hert G-rr stead,
the administration's appointees, has
been seen entering the grand jury
room nearly even,- day, after it be
came known that a cleanup crusade
had been started. It is supposed
that in many Instances several In
dictments of one kind or another
have- been returned against one per
son, and that each indictment may
have several counts.
The frand jury report marked a
finale in the investigations that have
been conducted during the pa.st three
weeks. The jurors had finished
their work and were excused for the
term.
Most of the indictments that were
expected, would take in men arrest
ed In the numerous recent police
raids, aloni; with some of the higher-ups,
including Councilman Arthur
Miller, elected on the Citizens'
ticket.
A divorce suit that may result in
having these indictments thrown
out was bled yesterday by Mrs. Ger
trude Fack, against Edward Fuck,
one of the jurors.
The wife in her suit says she hns
no knowledge of her husband own
ing property, which is one qualifi
cation a juror must meet before he
is entitled to sit on the jury. She
asks for a restraining order in ciso
her husband shows he is a property
owner.
She asks for $5,h00 alimony. Siu
alleges that he is a life tenant on a
tana near -New Carlisle.

President of Schoo! Board
Says He Will Quit if Clem
and Rupel Agre
to Proposal.
COMMITTEE CALLS
ON MAYOR KELLER
Meeting of Business Men and
Teachers Held at Chamber
of Commerce Asks
Resignations.
A. U Hubbard, minority member
of the school board, which last week
refused to renew the contract of
Supt. I J. Montgomery, will resign
from the board if F. F. Kupel and
William Clem, the men who did the
ousting, will. Mr. Hubbard made
his decision public Thursday morn
ill?, hut said that, he had considered
it all during the controversy.
That the resignation of all of the
members of the board was the only
sure way of clearing up the school
irouiJe was the opinion of Mr.
Hubbard. He said that the plan
adopted by the citizens at a meeting
at the Chamber of Commerce Wed
nesday niuht to have Judge Timothy
F. Howard and Judge Vernon V.
Van Fleet act as tribunal to pass on
the school situation was a good one,
but that the school hoard could save
a lot of trouble, If they resigned.
"Fverybody ought to have confi
dence in that plan, if any confidence
is to ho placed in human nature,"
said Mr. Hubbard. "I have thought
all the time that the school board
should resign to make things bet
ter." Met rayor Keller.
W. W. Kidenour, a member of the
park board, who acted as chairman
of Wednesday night's meeting, with
Frank K. Hering, who advanced the
tribunal plan, went into session with
Mayor Keller at 1:30 o'clock this af
ternoon to talk over the school sit
uation with the executive. They
were to take up th plan decided
upon at the citizens meeting with
the mayor and get some kind cf ac
tion from him on the matter.
Neither Mr. Kupel nor Mr. Clem
could be located Thursday to give
their views of the tribunal plan or
their resignation. The resignation
of all three members of the board
has been suggested several times
and at the eighth district confer
ence of the Rotary clubs here Tues
day resolutions were passed asking
that they quit the hoard.
Although Mr. Hubbard has been
in favor of Mr. Montgomery all the
time his resignation has been sug
gested in order that an entirely new
board may be named. It has been
said that if he were allowed to re
main with two new members, the
work of the board might be hinder
ed. Mont gomory Cominomlexl.
Mr. Kidenour, as chairman of the
gathering, spoke brietly In com
mendation of Mr. Montgomery as a
man and as an educator. Itev. C.
A. läppineott also addressed the
meeting, following the outline of the
plan of procedure by Mr. Hering,
representing a conference of busi
ness men. Mr. Ljppincott spoke
chierty oil the character of the su
perintendent. He declared this a
necessity to insure his future use
fulness to the community and to the
world.
Mr. Hering eulogized the former
jurists and suggested them a.s mem
bers of the tribunal. His remarks
were met with applause by those
present. The mee'.'ng was decidedly
"Montgomery," but over all there
seemed an impelling spirit for justice
first. '
Not an inharmonious note was
sounded. Horace Green moved the
adoption of Mr. Hering's suggestion,
which was pc. in th form of a mo
tion. Th t were a number of sec
onds. A committee was appointed
to draft resolutions. Home C.

WASHINGTON. Feb. 24. Oppo
sition to Henry V. Fletcher as am

such a comparatively few re
publicans that administration lead

day of his confirmation within a
few clays.
Sen. Rorah of Idaho, however, will
lead a forlorn hope against Mr.
Fletcher's confirmation, more for the
sake of placing himself on record
against the sending of an ambassa

in the expectation of seriously de

Takes Personal Charge of

International Nr Service:
WASHINGTON. Feb. 2. Prcs't
Wilson today defied congress to in
terfere in the international relations
of the United States. He declined
to receive Rep. Flood, chairman of
the house foreign affairs committee,
who was commissioned by a number
of his colleagues to tell the presi
dent that if he persisted in his de
mands that Germany refrain from
attacking armed merchant vessels
without warning, congress would
pass a resolution demanding that
passports be refused Americans w ho
would not agree to remain off such
vessels.
The president told Rep. Flood
over the telephone that he saw no
reason to change his announced at
titude and that he must decline to
further discuss the submarine ques
tion at this time.
Simultaneously with this announce
ment. Sec'y to the Pres't Tumulty
cancelled all of the president's en
gagements for today and tomorrow
with the exception of tomorrow's
cabinet meeting. The president then
left the white house and walked
leisurely down town and looked
over the exhibits of the "safety first"
exhibit in progress at the new Na
tional museum under the auspices
of the government's departments.
IresUUiit in Charge.
The president has taken personal
charge of the negotiations with Ger
many. Until a definite settlement Is
reached, or a break comes, oifkials
said, he will remain in closest touch
with Sec'y of State Lansing. It is
understood to be the intention of
the president to bring the negotia
tions to a head without any unnec
essary delay. The German reply to
Sec'y Lansing's informal communi
cation of a week ago. in which Ger
many was asked whether the new
declaration that commencing (March
1 all armed merchantmen will be
sunk without warning does not
abridge the promises previously
made by Germany to this govern
ment will be made to ec'y Lansing
late today or tomorrow.
It may be made the medium of
the president demanding a speedy
reply to th main points at issue,
inasmuch as it is stated to be a
question in turn as to Just what Oils
government considers defensive
armament for merchant craft. In
replying to this query, the president
may, officials say, ask that Germany
make prominent reply to the orig
inal question. This easily could be
done as the administration has re
fused to accept the promises made
In the Lusitania case which were
offered to completely dispose of the
submarine question.
The president, it Is stated In
v. hite house official circles, has be
come convinced that tho Germar
foreicn office is seeking to take un
due) advantage of the efforts made by
the United States to bring about a
modus vivendi in the armed mere
chant question and resents it. Criti
cism that he has changed front on
the issue the president is con red
has been fostrd by Orrn diplo
matic sources in this country.
And in consequence oflicials say
i he is determined to pet unmistak-
rble assurances that international
l.V.v will br olyerved by the central
powers even at the risk of war. For
(officials no longer hob! to the pleas
ant fiction that diplomatic relations
can be broken off and the matter
I ermitte l to rest there.
Break to Mean War.
Germany will not accept a diplo
matic break, otT-ciaN hre hav
have learned, without forvjne a
dec'aration of war. and it is th;s
kr.opik that has brought about
the, open critiMsm of the president's
Polle in congress. The southern
! and middle west senators and repre
sentatives flatly insist that their cori
jstituents are utterly o;; ose-d to any
