by Minister Handsaker at the Chris
tian church next Sunday evening.
A great deal of interest is being
manifested in the subject as Mr.
Handsaker has sent letters to a great
many young men of Heppner Raking
an expression on the subject. He
will read from these replies in his
sermon.
A similar service will be held Sun
day evening, March 12, when the
young men will be under considera
tion and the young women will be
given an opportunity to speak their
sentiments on the model youug man.
RABBIT PARASITES
NOT HUMAN PESTS
"The recent 'scare' about the dan
ger of eating Jack rabbits is entirely
without foundation," says Asa C.
Chandlor, of the Oregon Agricultural
College department of Zoology. "Ac
cording to recent newspaper reports
there is danger of infection from a
dangerous tapeworm parasite, Taenia
echinococcus, when rabbits are eaten.
It is true that the above-mentioned
tapeworm Is a human parasite to be
dreaded, but it has nothing to do
with the tapeworm cysts found In the
tissue of rabbits.
"The life histories of all tape
worms are very similar. The adult
tapeworms live in the intestines of
their hosts and produce thousands of
eggs. These eggs pass out of the
body of the animal that harbors the
worm and develop into little round
embryos with six hooks. To continue
their development these must be eat
en by some other animal, usually of
an entirely different kind. When so
eaten the little hix-hooked embryo
bores its way Into the organs and
tissues of its new host, and develops
into a cyst or bladder on the inside
of which, turned inside out, there
grows one or many tapeworm heads.
These bladder worms may grow to a
very large size, but no further devel
opment takes place until they are
eaten by the kind of animal from
which the eggs originally came.
"The common 'bladder worms'
found in the connective tissue of rab
bits, especially just under the skin
and between the muscles, are the lar
vae of a species of tapeworm known
as Taenia serlalis, and -will develop
further only if eaten by a dog or
coyote, or possibly by some other
carnivorous animals such as wolves
and foxes.
"In the intestine of such animals
the 'bladder' is digested off, the,
'head' turns right Bide out, fastens
itself to the wall of the intestine by
hooks and suckers, and begins to
form a series of segments, thus devel
oping Into the ordinary type of tape
worm. If the 'bladders' of the rabbit
were eaten by man, however, the
'heads' as well as the bladders would
be digested and there would be no
evil effects. Babbits are again in
fected by accidentally eating the eggs
voided with the excrement of dogs
or coyotes.
"The species known as Taenia
echinococcus, supposed to have been
found in jack rabbits in Portland, is
another species which will develop
and become mature only in dogs, coy
otes and wolves, but the bladder
worm stage develops in a great va
riety of animals, suoh as sheep, cat
tle, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs, hogs,
some birds, and In man. It Is rare
in rabbits and when found In them Is
almost always in the liver or lungs;
in this larval condition it is absolute
ly harmless to man. Only if swal
lowed as eggs do these tapeworms
develop in the Intestine of the dog
and are voided with the excrement,
there is danger of infection from al
lowing dogs to lick the faces of child
ren, and children should be taught
the danger of 'kissing' dogs."
BALL TOMORROW NIGHT
The committees having in charge
the preparations for the Elks Annual
Ball have about completed their
work. Several brothers from Con
don will be on hand, besides several
new members from the same place
who are to be Initiated tonight. The
United Orchestra, of Pendleton, will
iurnish the music for the ball.
New Soda Fountain Arrives.
Patterson & Son have just com
pleted the Installing of a new $1500
Boda fountain in their drug store. The
fountain is a thing of beauty and
probably surpasses anything of its
kind in this part of the state. Tables
have also been placed in the store
and ice cream will be served.
Frank Cramer, of Hardman, paid
Heppner a business visit this week.
He was accompanied by his son. Mr.
Cramer speaks optimistically of the
crop outlook and predicts a big bar
vest this year.
Some Interesting figures regarding
the number of great inventions which
have been brought about during the
past fifty years by the different na
tions of the world, were brought to
our attention this week by Geo. Aiken
through a clipping from the National
Geographical Magazine. The United
States heads the list with 38. Ger
many and Great Britain are listed
second with 3 each. Italy is fourth.
Some contention has been made that
Germany leads the world in the num
ber of inventions, but these figures,
which come from an authoritive
source, disprove any such contention.
The Yankee inventive genius is hard
to beat.

FRED ELDER, Executor.
IS NOT LEAVING HEPPNER,
s During the past few days it has
been rumored that the undersigned
sold his law business in Heppner.
The rumor is without foundation.
My business is not for sale and never
has been offered for sale. I have of
fered my residence property for sale
at a reasonable figure during the
past year, but not my business. .
Heppner is my home. It is my
home town and I expect to remain
here because I believe in the future
of my home town and Morrow Coun

Mrs. Cook Injured.
Mrs. A. J. Cook received severe
sprains and bruises from a fall off the
back porch of her home In south
Heppner Monday morning.- A thin
coating of ice on the porch caused
Mrs. Cook to fall. She will probably
be confined to her home on account
of the injuries sustained for some
time.
ROARING WATERS TELL-
TO
Recently Mrs. C. W. Shurte had
her sixth grade pupils submit a story
about the high water which was oc
casioned by the Chinook. She prom
ised them the best one would be
printed. The composition by Carl
Cason was given first honor and is
herewith published.
Heppner, Oregon, Feb. 22, 1916.
Dear Mrs. Shurte:
I am going to tell you what the
creek said to me.
As I was standing on the bridge
the roaring waters told me this story.
"I have come from the mountains
so high where the snow Is deep and
wet, it came to my beds and followed
me here.
"I have made many a fish unhappy.
I lashed upon the shore and left some
of my friends there. I'm muddy,
dirty, ugly, so that no one will like
to look at me. There was some stock
came and started to drink me but the
mud was too much for them.
"I have washed away logs, bridges,
earth and fish, I'm so unhappy and
I will be glad again when I get pure
and white, when I can see the fish
caught beside me. -
"When I can go Into the fields and
irrigate them, when the stock will
drink me, when I can put out fires,
and do many useful things to the
world. '
"I am now on my way to the
ocean, where others can see me.
There I will help carry the ships that
float on me.
"I will have to leave you now and
run on to the ocean."
Yours truly,
CARL CASON.

Hi SCHOOL STUDENTS PRESENT
PLEASING PATRIOTIC PROGRAM
W. Pearl LeTrace.
It seems everyone of the large au
dience that attended the last literary
program went away well pleased.
The different selections recited and
read were loudly applauded. The
drill was beautiful. Uncle Sam (Troy
McCraw) and Columbia (Oma Ben
nett) acting their parts out with the
greatest dignity and stateliness.
The double quartet sang several
selections fitting the occasion.
O sold was sung by Lester Ingram
and was heartily applauded by the
people.
Perhaps the most dramatic and ef
fective part of the program was the
tableaux. The lights of the auditor
ium were turned out, and the tab
leaux lit up by the stereopticon and
"red fire", The first part was "The
Birth of Old Glory." Around the
table on which was the flag stood
Betty Ross (Norma Frederick)" and
George Washington and several oth
ers. "Lincoln, the Man of the Peo
ple" was the next. Lincoln ' (Troy
McCraw). was sitting on a bench. On
his face the expression of a person
with the deep sorrow and the bur
dens of his country and people was
seen. The last was the "Spirit of
'76." It was the picture of three or
four patriots. The leader with sword
and gun, the small drummer boy and
a wounded comrade watching them.
Mr. C. L. Sweek gave an excellent
speech fitting the occasion. He brot
to the minds of his audience the topic
"What Washington or Lincoln Would
Have Said About Preparedness had
They Been Living Now." It was a
real, live and interesting subject and
well delivered.
The Student Body President Not Re
covering Rapidly.
Thomas Hughes does not seem to
recover very rapidly from his illness.
In fact he has had a relapse, which
almost goes to prove that he will not
be able to attend school the rest of
the term.

Walker's Hall. It will be a vaudeville
performance with an abundance of
good, clean fun, Including a short
minstrel performance.
Peter Brenner was among those in
lone Saturday from the Gooseberry
section. Being one of the oldest set
tlers of the county he Is quite well
posted at so conditions in former
years.a nd he looks forward to one of
the largest yields of grain the county
has had for many years past.
Floyd Barlow, son of W. L. Bar
low, of Eight Mile, was able to ac
company his parents home on Tues
day. Young Mr. Barlow made a visit
to relatives in the east last fall, and
on his return was taken down with
pneumonia at Oregon City, where he
was very sick for a number of weeks.
Mr. and Mrs. Rufus Farrens came
in on Tuesday from their farm at
Gooseberry. Mr. Farrens, who has
been confined to his home most of
the winter with severe sickness, is
now greatly Improved and has hopes
of being able to get in the fields to
work as soon as the 'ground settles.
His section is still too wet to do any
spring work.
Aaron Peterson was down from
Eight Mile Tuesday. He has been
digging about his premises to find
how deep the moisture Is, and the
further he dug the wetter it got, and
he feels sure that there will be
enough moisture In the ground to
make a bumper crop if it will only
get dry enough on the surface for the
farmers to get to work.
Chas. Reld is preparing to go onto
the roads with the big county road
scraper, and will soon have the thor
oughfares of his district in good or
der. Charley also has hopes of land
ing the contract for the road work
between Lexington and Heppner,
which it is understood the county
court contemplates letting right
away. Too bad that the entire road
down the creek to this place cannot
be put In shape as has been planned
for some time past.
We really felt sorry for the Hepp
ner girls at the basket ball game on
Saturday evening, and think they
should have been able to throw a few
more baskets and evened up the score
with the young ladies of lone. Nine
teen miles in a hayrack, over the
roads between lone and Heppner, is
not calculated to put much "pep" in
to a bunch of ball players, regardless
of their enthusiasm. It was a nice,
clean game and greatly enjoyed by
the large number who attended.
Some spring-like weather here at
present, and It is having its effect on
our citizens. Gardens are being
spaded up, trees trimmed, backyards
cleaned of rubbish, and a general air
of "preparedness' for the warm wea
ther is manifest. No injury to fruit
trees and shrubbery has been report
ed, and before a great while, lone
will be blossoming out in glorious
beauty, and will present to the public
an appearance that will gladden the
heart. We look forward to an abun-

count of the bad weather.
Alfred Anderson Is moving down
on the N. A. Clark place which he has
rented from Mr. Clark. Al. says he
has about eight hundred acres of
grain to put in this spring. Go to it,
Al., the prospects are good.
; The snow has been gone for about
two weeks or more but owing to the
fact that it has been foggy for the
past week the ground is drying very
slowly, it will be a couple of weeks
yet before there can be any farming
done. ,
Lawrence Redding was fixing fence
One day last week and had the mis
fortune to get his team and wagon
mired down. Lawrence says he isn't
going to fix any more fence until it
gets dry enough for him to stay on
top. C. E. Jones had the same ex
perience a few days before this.
Owing to the condition of the roads
the Heppner, Eight Mile and Goose
berry stage line has been cut into.,
One team comes from Heppner to
Eight Mile and is met there by a
tsam which takes the mail to Goose
berry. This is oniy temporary. When
the roads are good the one team from
Heppner makes the round trip. .

Water Did Little Damage.
Roy Glasscock, who lives a few
miles below Mt. Vernon, was here the
first of the week. He was accompan
ied by his sons Edward and Harland.
His son Edward is as fine a specimen
of young manhood as Is developed In
the Mt. Vernon region. He Is 17
years of age and now growing on his
seventh foot. :. Or- to be mors specific
he is six feet two. Mr. Glasscock re
ports that very little damage was
done In that section by the recent
high water. He also states that there
was plenty of hay In that section. It
might not be distributed equally as
hungry cows might desire but it is in
the country. Blue Mountain Eagle.

dant harvest of good fruit this sea
son. Our city council Is enforcing an
order requiring all dogs of the place
to be muzzled. This action is taken
as a precautionary measure to pre
vent the spread of rabies. Many a
cur Is being quartered at the present
time In the city pound, having no
o'wner to claim him and see that he Is
properly equipped with a muzzle, and
Marshal Frank will soon be called
upon to send them to the happy hunt
ing ground. This will be a good rid;
dance and greater peace and quiet
should prevail. However, the order
to muzzle the dog running at large Is
a good one and It Is worthy of note
that the city is having It carried out
to the letter.
Geo. Miller, of Cecil, reports the
killing of a mad coyote at his place
on Tuesday. The animal came Into
the door yard and was shot by one
cit the hired hands from the Wm. O'-
Sullivan ranch. These coyotes would
seem to be very hungry and It may
be that while many of them act as
though mad and perform capers not
looked for In such wild animals, yet
it may be that very few of them are
afflicted with hydrophobia. Just the
same, there Is no need to take any
chances and domestic animals that
are bitten by them should be watched
very closely. This ccryote at the
Miller place chewed up one of the
dogs In bad shape.
The report of the state health of
ficer on the coyote that was killed
last week by Ike Howard, Is to the ef
fect that the animal was afflicted
with the rabies. Out of a total of
180 specimens that had been re
ceived and examined by the depart
ment, this was tH first to show the
disease. This coyote had bitten two
dogs on the Mat Hulvorsen place be
longing to John Johnson, and Mr.
Johnson is keeping the animals con
fined, awaiting developments. About
the same time that Mr. Howard kill
ed his coyote, Oscar Williamson dis
patched another one at his place that
had many symptoms of being mad.
He did not take time to have the
head shipped to Portland for exam
ination, and he does not think the
coyote had bitten any of his dogs or
stock. '
CLUB ENDORSES :
NAVAL RASE Bill
Re-Establishment of Hai'dman-Mon-ument
Mail Route is Again De
layed. Club Favors Non
partisan Tariff Board.
The Heppner Commercial Club at '
their meeting on Wednesday evening :
adopted resolutions favoring the As
toria Naval Base Bill, which is now
pending in Congress. The bill pro
vides for the establishment of a naval
base at the mouth of the Columbia
and asks Congress for an Initial ap
propriation of $3,000,000.
Secretary Smead read a letter from .
the Portland Chamber of Commerce '
which stated that the United States '
Chamber of Commerce, by a vote of
215 to 18 had favored the appoint-,
ment of a non-partisan tariff board
and asked the endorsement of the .
move by the local club. The club ,
was unanimous In its endorsement.
A communication to the club from
W. . S. McKimmey, dealing with .
"man's inhumanity to man" was read
by the secretary.
T. J. Mahoney, chairman of the
committee on the Hardman-Monu-ment
mail route, has received a letter
from Congressman Sinnott stating
that the bid of Arthur Harlow for
carrying the .mail would not be con
sidered by the postoffice department
for the reason that the bid had not -been
presented in the proper form.
Mr. Harlow's bid was the only one
received by the department. Mr.
Harlow has re-submitted his bid in
proper form and the committee,
through Mr. Sinnott, Is now striving
to get a re-consideration from the
department.
Chas. Thomson, as a member of
the creamery committee, made a par
tial report that the committee was ,
still working and that more would be
accomplished in the matter of rais
ing funds for the proposition as soon
as Ira M. Morgan returned from
lone. In this connection, interesting
talks wese mads by O. M. Whitting
ton and N. A. Clark. Mr.. Whltting
ton, speaking from the farmer's view
point, is of the opinion hat very
little of the $1100 which must be se
cured, will have to be raised in Hepp
ner. He rather believes, that many
of the dairymen now selling cream
will be only too glad to take stock In
the local creamery. Mr. Whitting
ton asked for a closer cooperation be
tween the farmer and the business
man In town. At the conclusion of
Mr. Whittington's talk, secretary
Smead made a motion that a com
mittee of three be appointed by the
club to confer with a like committee
of the Morrow County Farmers' Un
ion on all matters which may come
up that are of mutual interest to both
organizations. The motion was car
ried. The committee on roads was in

court next week to take up the mat
ter of Improving Morrow county's
