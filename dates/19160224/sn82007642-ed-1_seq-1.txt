BOONE WATAUGA COUNTY, THURSDAY February 24, 1916.
NO. 28.
Thi Ntw Priniry Law.
Brace Craven io Charlotte Observer.
The law applies to every coun
ty in North Carolina, and in each
of them the State primary must
be held on Saturday, June 3. .
The provisions of the primary
do not apply to county offices
and representatives to the lower
house of the legislature in the
following counties: Alamance, Al
exander, Alleghany, Ashe, Beau
fort, Brunswick, Caldwell. Cataw
ba, Cabarrus, Clay, Currituck,
Craven, Dare, Davidson, Davie,
Duplin, Edgecombe, Gaston,
Gates, Graham, Halifax, Har
nett, Hoke, Hyde, Jones, Lee,
Macon, Martin, Mecklenburg,
Montgomery, Mitchell, New Han
over, Northampton, Pamlico,
Sampson, Stanley, Stokes, Sur
ry, Swain, Transylvania, Tyrrell,
Union, Watauga, Wilkes, Yad
kin and Yancey.
In these counties which are
named and in all the others, the
State primary will be held on
June 3. In the counties named,
the primary will be for all offices
except the county offices and rep
resentatives. Iu the counties not
named the primary will be for of
fices of every kind.
In a county like Mecklenburg
which already has a local prima
ry law, the new law take the
place of the old local law except
for county offices. Mecklenburg
and such others, accordingly, will
have two primaries unless the lo
cal one is also called for June 3.
Section 2 of the act provides
that the primary in all the 100
counties, shall include voting for
president and vice-president, and
delegates to the national con
vention will be bound by t h e
vote and a plurality shall decide,
so that the delegation niuut be
"solid" and stay that way.
Section 5 provides that a new
registration book Bhall be provi
ded for the first primary, and
each voter shall enter his party
affiliation when registering, and
shall not be allowed to vote in
the primary unless he does this.
There shall be one ballot for
each party, and all candidates
for the various offices must be on
that ballot, with the name of the
party at the head of the ballot.
This section 9 and section 5 make
almost impossible any indepen
dent candidate for office either in
the primary or in the general e
lection, though section 20 pro
vides that an independent candi
date may have bis name placed
on the official ballot for the gen
eral election by petition from 10
per cent of the vo ters.
In the event that no candidate
receives a majority in the first
primory there shall be a second
primary provided the next high
est candidate within five days de
mands a second primary in wri
ting. -This coims very near to
making a second primary impos
sible, as the candidate who would
demand it would likely be defeat
ed because he did it
All candidates for State and
district offices and the State Sen
ate from asenatoriadistrictcom
prising more than one county,
must file notice of candidacy
with the State board of elections
on or before April 22. All other
candidates, for county offices,
representatives and State sena
tor from one county, must file
notice by May 20 with the coun
ty board of elections.
The fees required when filing
notice are as follows: State ot
congressional offices $ 0; for supe
rior court judge or solicitor f 20;
State senator, representative and
county offices $5, except that the
.following pay only one dollar:
gurueyor, coroner and county
commissioners.

Cheese making offers great pos
sibilities as a profitable industry
in an area of about 30,000
square miles of mountain terri
tory in the south, according to
the cheese specialists of the de
partment. These conclusions were
reached as the result of close ob
servation of three small experi
mental cheese factories, two of
which are cooperative, which the
North Carolina College of Agri
culture and the department,
working in cooperation, have as
sisted the farmers in the moun
tain section of that State to es
tablished. These three factories,
which have just passed a success
ful season, are located in little
valleys remote from railroads, as
it is true of most of the moun
tain valleys of the section.
The factories were started by
State and Government men who
helped the farmers in the locali
ties To organize and then advised
them in the building of the fac
tories, which in these cases were
small and constructed as cheap
ly as possible. As the factories
were small, and trained cheese
makers from the labor districts
demand higher wages than such
factories can pay, the State and
Government agents selected
bright young men in each com
munity and trained them in
cheese making. The State agent
then visited each factory fre
quently throughout the summer
and assisted the local manager.
The experiment has proved that
this preliminary training and
later supervision are absolutely
necessary to the success of such
an enterprise, because cheese
making is a highly developed art
requiring skill and experience.
Following is a statement of
the result obtained in the two
cooperative factories.
The Cove Creek cooperative
cheese factory, near Sugar Grove,
N. C, was built for about $300,
which included the cost of a ce
ment curing room and equip
ment. It began business on
June 5, 1915, with 63 gallons of
milk. Thf deliveries increased as
the farmers grew familiar with
the plan until, on the best
day, 195 gallons were turned in
for chese making. During the sea
son a total of 104,990 pounds
of milk was made into 8,992 lbs.
of chese. The chese sold for about
11 cents a pound, or 2 cents
more than was received by some
of t;he Wisconsin factories. The
milk thus made up into cheese,
at a liberal estimate, would not
have brought the farmers more
than $300, but in cheese was
soldfoi $1,588.68 As few of the
supplies of the factory were pur
chased outside of the communi
ty, and as local labor was am
ple, a large part of the total was
clear gain. One farmer in the
Cove Creek community sold $130
worth of milk from three cows
which had previously raised
calves. A fair value for the calves
would bo $60. He therefore real
ized from the three cows for calves
and milk $190, of which the
cheese factory paid two thirds.
The Grassy Creek cooperative
factory, located near Grassy
Creek, N. C, was built at a cost
of about $400 including equip
ment. It was opened for busi
ness on July 16. During the sea
son it manufactured 11,000
pounds of cheese, for which the
sum of $1,595 was received.
ate party organization has the
power to fill the vacancy, but
this power does not apply to a
position for which no one was
nominated in the primary.
At the time of the closing date
for entries into the primary, if
there shall be only one candidate
for any office, he shall be declar
ed the nominee without being vo
ted for in the primary.
Death Of Editor Robert A. Dial.
Wilkesboro Hustler.
Mr. Robert A. Deal, editor of
the Chronicle, for a few years of
the 25 years which he run it the
only county newspaper then
printed in Wilkes, breathed his
last at his home in Wilkesboro
Saturdayeveningat 5:35o'clock.
He had been in feeble health for
about seven years caused'by tu
berculosis. He underwent treat
ment at Ashevilp underwa noted
German specialist seven years
agoand afterwards went to the
State Sanatorium at Montrose
where h e remained several
months. Last Wednesday and
Thursday he suffered six hem
raorages, and his friends thought
then he would not live long.
He is survived by his wife and
five children-Frank, Estelle, Fred
Mildred , and J ames. The follow
ing data is taken from "Histori
cal Sketches of JWilkes County,"
by John Crouch, issued in 1902:
"Robert Avery Deal, editor and
owner of The Chronicle, was born
in Caldwell county Dec. 6, 1865,
and was raised on the farm at
tending the public schools a part
of the sessions He attended
Rutherford College under Prof.
R. L. Abernethy for about two
years, going in debt for his tuit
ion. After leaving Rutherford he
taught school, and when the
Chronicle was established he
worked with it until he bought
the paper, paying the last of his
Rutherford tuition after coming
to Wilkesboro. On Feb. 7, 1900
he was married to Miss Mamie
Wallace, by which union tvo
children have been born. Mr.
Deal is a man of deep thought
and by close application has
made a reputation for thorough
ness in whatever he undertakes.
He is an ardent Democrat and
an earnest worker for his party,
having served for a number of
years as chairman of the coun
ty executive committee. He was
postmaster at Wilkesboro dur
ing Cleveland's last administra
tion." Mr. Deal had a youthful love
for his State at large and was
mindful of his sacred institutions
and took part in Jits politics, in
his latter days wrote that people
were not taking enough interest
in politics in this country. He
made the nominating speech of
W. H. H. Cowles for Congress at
Lenoir in 1890 when Colonel
Folk nominated Congressman
Hort. Rower and when Major
W. A. Graham, now State Com
missioner of Agriculture, was a
candidate, 147 ballots being nec
cessary before nomination.
The funeral was held at the
Methodist church yesterday af
ternoon at 2 o'clock conducted
by the pastor, Rev. U. J. Jones,
and Revs. T. J. Rogers and C. W.
Robinson, in Wilkesboro. The
school children attended the ser
vices, the Masonic Order conclu
ding the ceremony at the grave
south of town. A large number
ol people attended, the church
being filled. Beautiful floral off
erings were made.
In his writing Mr. Deal was so
experienced that he knew how to
get the facts and how to write
them in short space. Editor
Caldwell of the Charlotte Obser
ver once told a Wilkes county
man before he became acquain
ted with Mr. Deal, that he did
not believe "Deal wrote his edi
torials himself." But he came
nearer doing this absolutely than
most of us.

Charlotte Observer.
Sir Edward Gray recently made
a speech in Parliament that has
offered . The London Observer
material for a five-column edi
torial on the interesting subject
of the British blockade and the
American contention against it.
The intent of the speech was to
show that the blockade is not a
sham and a farce and that the
Foreign Office aud the Navy
"have a grave problem well in
hand." The sum and substance
of the Observer's editorial is that
England has found that a dou
ble blockade by land and is the
only effective way of conqereing
Germany. Even that would de
pend on the Allies in the mean
time keeping their main front un
broken. All other means failing,
The Observer says that ''the
double blockade would cut off
German hopes as well as German
supplies. Sea power alone would
ensue a draw, but could no more.
The added mastery of the Bal
kans in the East by the Allies
would ensure by its economics as
well as its military effect the com
pleteness of victory. By the thor
ough employment of all means
to solve the problem as a whole
the Allie would win the war this
year." The dependence of Eng
land may explain her obstinate
adherence to the Orders fn Coun
cil. The argument is made by the
Observer that in the ear of Amer
ican diplomacy the name of "Or
ders in Council" has an evil sound.
"But" it says, "we know it to be
uo arbitrary fiat, but an old con
stitutional terra as ordinary and
inoffdnsive in itself as the phrase
"Act of Parliament." The Uni
ted States much prefers the tech
nical proclamation of a block
ade, since that word is interna
tiononal law. If that were all
there would be not the least ob
jection on our part. We would
consent with all the alacrity of n
quick change artist. But that is
by no means all. Sir Edward
Grey remarked: 'If you were to
concede all that was asked in the
last note of the United Staees
you might just as well give up
trying to prevent goods, even
contraband goods, going thro'
neutral countries to the enemy.,
The Foreign Secretary, however,
does not understand that this,
or anything like this, is the set
tled claim of President Wilson's
Government.
Great Britain's quandary seems
action that wouid please the U-
nited States and at the same
time not offend (he Allies for
England rather smarts under
"the sole odium of inflicting on
the neutrals the inconnvenience
which this war makes snevitable
The Observer admits that the
Foreign Secretary has not satis
fied America, but it thinks Sii
Edward Grey has made ample
excuse. It gives assurance that
to reach an agseement with the
United States "we shall do every
thing possible short of a sacri
fice of our belligerent rights, as
would mean the economic paral
ysis of the sea power, the betray
al of our Allies and a triumph
won over the British fleet by Ger
many through Washington."
The Observer advises England
that "we conduct this part of the
discussion with scrupulous calm
ness and moderation, nor must
we ever forget that President
Wilson, whatever his view, is the
head of one of the greatett na
tions ana of a kindred Power.
Those amongst us would be be
yond pardon who attempted
henceforth to brine: bitterness,
teers aud cheap railing into this
msiness." There is no doubt of
the fact that The London Obser
ver reflects British sentiment and
it is equaly plain that the neero-
tiations with that Government
promises to be of a stubborn
character antl in smoothness oi
(pars? perhaps to be doubted.
ROOSEVELT.
It has come to pass that one
hears as much talk of Roosevelt
on the Republican side as is heard
of Wilson on the Democratic
side. On part of the Repubicuns
the elimination process seems to
have been completed and all New
England is lining up for the Co
lonel, since, as it has been pictur
esquely described, "the sudden
driving of the band wagon into
the Bay State with a great flour
ish by Congressman Gardner."
They have even quit talking a
bout Hughes, while the Republi
cans and Progressives alike are
laying their courses for prospec
tive offices after the Fourth of
next March. The movement to
unite on Roosevelt is making un
mistakable headway. The only
question is as to the thorough
ness of the job of amalgamation
that may be accomplished at
Chicago. A staff correspondent
undertakes to enlighten the Phil
adelphia Public Ledger on what
is going on in New Lngland,
where the plans of tne progres
sives have not been changed by
the appearance of a Republican
Roosevelt movement in Massa
cnusetts. "They are going ahead
in the selection of their own del
Tatesto the Progressive Con
vention, which will bo held in
Chicago at the same time as the
Republican National Convention.
Their slates are now in process
of election, and places on the
various State delegations are in
great demand, for these faith
ful Bull Moose but a few remain
are looking forward to the ma
king of history in the Windy
City next June, and they are ea
ger to be there. They are going
with the determination of nomi
nating Theodore Roosevelt. They
confidently believe that the Re
publican convention will be stam
peded to him, and that he will
emerge the standard-bearer of a
reunited party." Charlotte Ob
