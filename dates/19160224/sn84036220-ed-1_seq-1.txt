IMPORTANT HAPPENINGS IN CONGRESS
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.—In
tional considerations which mov State
navy general board to change itL ..
honored policy last year and declare
that tlie United States navy should
equal the strongest afloat by not later
Ilian 1925, will be disclosed to the
house naval committee tomorrow in
executive session, by Rear Admiral
Charles J. Badger, a member of the
board. Examination of Admiral Bad
ger in open session was concluded to
day, the admiral consistently refusing
to discuss, except behind closed doors,
the board's views of dangers which
may confront the nation.
The subject came up when Repre-1
sentative Stephens of California, seek
ing to show that the Pacific coast was
inadequately defended, asked if the
board, in altering its policy did not
have in mind the possibility that the
country might have to face simultane
ously enemies in the Pacific and At
lantic oceans. Admiral Badger said
he could answer that only in execu
tive session. He explained, however,
that fleet capable of dominating the
Pacific ocean was the only sure pro
tection for the Pacific coast and said
that the earth slides in the Panama
eanal had made impossible, for the
present and possibly for another year,
the use of the fleet in both oceans.
Further discussion of the canal clos
ure also was deferred to the closed
session.
Admiral Badger expressed the opin
ion that should the United States
adopt a two-power standard navy, such
as recommended by the general hoard,
Great Britain would not alter her rate
of construction, at least until the gap
between the two fleets had been ma
terially reduced. Earlier in bis testi
mony he had said he did not consider
war with Great Britain even a remote
possibility.
Replying to a question by Repre
sentative Galloway, the admiral said
that in framing the $285,000,000 build
ing program it first proposed under
its new policy, the board had been
going on the theory that it was neces
sary to get as many big ships as pos
sible added to the fleet in the short
est time the country's building facili
ties would permit.
"Ho you think we have the same
reason for desiring supremacy of the
sea that England has?" Representa
tive Galloway asked.
"Not at present, perhaps," the wit
ness replied, "but eventually we would
have to reach out for our share of
world trade and anybody who stood in
the way of our getting a fair deal
would have to be dealt with."
Admiral Badger repudiated a sug
gestion that military men viewed all
international problems from the stand
point of force, while statesmen looked
upon force and diplomacy as equal
arms of government.
"Ultimately, however," he added,
"diplomacy depends on force."
Representative Britten asked if the
general board had not made a recom
mendation in 1914 which Secretary
Daniels had refused to make public
unless its remarks as to personnel in
the navy were stricken out. Prefacing
liis reply with the statement that Sec
retary Daniels was the first secretary
to make public the board's recom
mendation in full and that in navy reg
ulations they were regarded as for
, .. . . .
confidential use of the secretary only, j
Aamirai tiaclger said.
I think much more lias been made ;
that incident than is justified.".
He explained that the board had mado j
a general recommendation as to per
Representative Calloway produced !
a calculation which, lie said, had been j
made for him by a navy officer, com-!
paring the gunpowder of the American j
and German fleets. By these figures.!
lie said, the American fleet in guns
above five inch had a total muzzle j
energy of 6,166,448 foot tons and a to
tal broadside projectile weight of 792,
906 pounds; while Germany's total
muzzle energy was 5.474,858 and a
broadside projectile weight of 196,072
pounds.
SUPREME COURT DECIDES THAT MONTANA
MUST HOLD TWO PR IMARIES THIS YEAR
HELENA, Feb. 23. The supreme court today handed down a decision holding thal Montana must
hold to primaries this year instead of one, as was contended by some. The first primary will be held
April 21 to indicate presidential preference, to nominate electors and to elect national delegates; the sec
ond August 29 to nominate state and county tickets. The Montana primary laws were adopted from
the Oregon measure. The court bases its decision tnon the fact that "the apparently deliberate sepa
ration of the single Oregon law into the two Montana acts cannot be ignored."

It depends on how the guns are

replied. He pointed out that some
foreign navies employed many swift
cruisers with comparatively heavy
guns, which a single heavy ship with
a far lower total gun power would
sink in a few hours of combat.
While the naval committee was
gathering information, both the sen

of the measure to be drafted for the

STATE SECRETARY PUEHLER OF
BILLINGS CONFERS WITH
THE COMMITTEE.
UNDERTAKING IS A PRETTY BIG ODE
Plans are well under way for a
Y. M. G. A. in Lewistown, and after
several preliminary meetings in tlie
interest of such plans, it is safe to
state that organization is confidently
expected withhi the next few months
It will be remembered that at a re
cent luncheon of the Ghhmber of Com-1
merce the proposal of a civic club was
discussed, conceived along Y. M. G. A.
lines. At that time a committee of.
12 was appointed to make a thorough
investigation of the feasibility of such
a plan, as well as to ascertain com
infinity sentiment regarding it. It was
at lenglhe decided that a Y. M. C. A.
and not a civic club would be the
fore practical organization for Lew
istown and plans were formed. The
committee chose from its number two
subcommittees for finance and build-,
ling site, and meetings were called
from time to time to rpport pl - ogress .
At an invitation from the committee,
Charles Puehler of Billings, state see-j
retary ot the Y. M. G. A., came to Lew
! A committee ot live will be appoint-.
j *-° ,a ke the matter up at the pres
e,, l Point and carry it through to com-.
j pletion. That the plan will be sue
cessfully carried through there can be
very little doubt. The right men are
j back of the movement and the need
for a Y. M. G. A. here is so obvious
j that support will probably come un
i solicited. Secretary Puehler expects'
! to leave for Billings this morning, but
| will personally aid the local move-,
1 ment as it progresses.
TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND GERMAN TROOPS UNDER COMMAND OF CROWN PRINCE
ENGAGE A FRONT OF TWENTY-FIVE MILES, PROBABLY WITH THE CAPTURE OF
THE GREAT FORTRESS OF VERDUN AS THEIR OBJECTIVE.
Troops belonging to seven German army corps, u.ider Crown Prince Frederick William, are engaged
along a 25-mile front north of Verdun in a despera'e effort to drive back the French defending forces,
probably with the capture of the great fortress of Verdun in view. There has been very heavy fighting
f° r a considerable period in this district of the French war zone, but within the last few clays the at
tac ^ s °f *Ue Germans have taken on added strength. The battle line has been extended and now reaches
fr0m Malancourt on t,ie west - t0 E ,a '»- on the east, with Verdun in the center, only a few miles south
ward. The Germans claim to have made important advances and to some extent these are admitted by
the French war office, which describes the battle as one of increasing intensity.
The German preparations were ex
tensive and the bombardment of the
French positions with thousands of
shells was uninterrupted. As the
Frencli had foreseen this battle, till of
their available guns were called into
action and responded in kind lo the
heavy shelling of the Germans. While
at some points the French were tin
able to resist the onslaught of the at
tacking forces along much of the front,
according to the Paris communication,
tite attacks were well sustained and
very heavy losses were inflicted on
the Germans.
