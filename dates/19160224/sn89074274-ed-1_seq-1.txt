Implement Dealers Get Notice
of Harked Advance in Prices
No matter whether you call a spade
a spade or an agricultural Implement,
it is going to cost you more this spring
than it did last season. For months
the manufacturers of farm implements
have been toying with a general ad
vance in prices. Now the blow has
fallen.
Looal dealers have received notice
of an advance of from five to ten per
cent effective this month. This in
cludes practically every machine and
tool used on the farm.
"Binders, mowers, plows, drags and
every other implement will be affect
ed," said a Valley City implement deal
er. "It makes no difference where we
buy our goods, the price is the same.
There is no combine, but when one
big manufacturer announces a raise,
the remainder will follow suit."
The increase is attributed to the ad
vance in steel goods resulting from the
•war demand in Europe. All raw ma
terials have gone skyward and manu
facturers are experiencing great diffi
culty in obtaining a sufficient supply,
according to press notices received by
retail dealers.
All kinds of wire fencing also have
been affected since the war began.
There have been four advances in
price within the last two months and
the end is not yet.
"Wire fencing today is about 25 per
cent higher than it was last year," the
dealer said.
Binder twine has joined the aviation
corps and will be from three to four
cents higher than it was last season.
No prices have been made, but the in
dications are that the twine which sold
for six and three quarters cents a
pound will retail at nine or ten cents
this year. This advance is attributed
to the trust in Mexico which practical
ly controls the export of raw fiber
used largely in America.
The government is investigating the
twine trust, but it is not likely to have
any effect on the situation this year,
according to dealers.
The Degree of Honor Gave
Initiation Ceremony to Six
The Degree of Honor held.a meeting
Thursday evening at the home of Mrs.
F. R. Schultze on Main street. There
was a good attendance, about 30 being
present. Six candidates were initiates
into the order and the regular busi
ness of the evening taken up and dis
patched, after which the time was
spent in card playing by those who
wished, four or five tables being filled.
Fancy work occupied the others and at
a late hour the hostess served an elab
orate repast. There were a couple of
visitors present, one from Leal and
Leal Quintet Winners
in Game With Uxbridge
Saturday night the fast Uxbridge
basket ball team went down to defeat
at the hands of the Leal quintet. The
Leal boys were rather slow in finding
the pace the first part of the game, the
first half ending with the score of 12
to 7 in favor of Uxbridge. However, at
the beginning of the second half Leal
came back with lots of "pep" and by
their brilliant team work and close
guarding, completely bewildered and
outclassed the Uxbridge team, allowing
them but one point during that half
and winning the game by the score
of 23 to 13.
The domestic science girls served
everyone with a very delightful lunch
after the game.

Bank of Valley City
Great Financial Progress Shown
by State Banks of North Dakota
Bismarck, Feb 19.—The following abstract of comparative statement of the
state banks and trust companies in North Dakota for calls at the close of
business Dec. 31, 1914, and Dec. 31, 1915, furnished by Examiner Johnson will
undoubtedly prove interesting.
A similar statement was published in Minnesota recently showing a com
parative exhibit of the state bank business in that state and the Minnesota
papers lauded the fact that the statement showed an increase of $20,000,000.
By referring this statement it will be seen that North Dakota almost equals
its neighboring state in increase. These figures will undoubtedly be much in
creased in the next call, as there was a great deal of the 1915 products unsold
and business which would have otherwise been included in these statements
failed to show.
These figures compare favorably with those of Minnesota, exceed those of
Montana by ten millions, while, with the exception of three years, this state
has been in the lead of South Dakota every year during the past 15 years.
Another item which in this connection is apropos, is the comparative values
of the principal crops in Minnesota, Montana, North and South Dakota. The
value of our crop in 1915 was within five millions of that of Minnesota, exceed
ed that of South Dakota fifty million and exceeded that of Montana almost one
hundred and fifty millions.
The Rudolf Pharmacy was closed
Saturday and put up for sale. Dr.
Platou bid it in and in turn sold it to
C. N. McGillivray, who is moving the
stock to. his store on Main street.
Following are the comparative bank statements referred to above:

Moe and Person Mix
in Gruelling Match
VALLEY CITY HOST
FRIDAY TO MASONS
Nels Moe and Chris Person indulged
in a hard-fought wrestling bout at
Clark's hall Monday evening. Anton
Foss, of Grayling, Minn., acted as re
feree to the satisfaction of all. Per
son won the first fall in 33 minutes of
fast work with a crotch and bar hold.
The second session lasted three hours
and ten minutes and was forfeited by
Moe. He became convinced that he
could not throw the veteran and for
feited the fall rather than to continue
indefinitely. It was one of the fast
est and hardest fought matches seen
here. Both contestants worked to the
limit. Moe is disappointed in not ar
ranging a match with Bert Bruns here,
but the prospecjts for this set-to are
not very assuring at this time.

from a Gordian knot into a slipknot.

Clarence Darrow, Chicago Socialist,
the defender of Heywood, Moyar, Petti
bone and McNamara, it is rumored will
visit Valley City in March during a
state-wide campaign which the Non
partisan league will inaugurate. Points
in the state that will be visited are
Fargo, Grand Forks, Devils Lake, Mi
not Williston, Bismarck and Dickinson.
Owing to the fact that Barnes county
farmers are decidedly interested in
the work of the league, the visit of
Darrow to this city will draw an audi
ence second only to that which greet
ed LaFollette here last summer.
Darrow consented to make addresses
in the state after lengthy correspond
ence with league leaders. It was stat
ed yesterday that the Nonpartisan lea
gue will use 50 automobiles in canvass,
ing the state before the June pri
maries.
Many organizers, it was. said, have
been working all winter. It is planned
to work each county thoroughly.
