PRESIDENT WORST
WILL BE SUCCEEDED
BOARD OF REGENTS ELECTS HIM
AS PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF
AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE
Toq Many Heads—Board Seeks to
Concentrate Authority and
Objectives
"The election of President John H.
Worst of the agricultural college as
professor emeritus of the North Da
kota agricultural college, by the
board of regents, is the first step to
wards a complete reorganization of
the administration department of the
college—it is designed as the first
movement towards the concentration
of executive authority at the institu
tion, and is in line with the board's
desire to make the agricultural col
lege just what it ought to be—a col
lege for instruction in agriculture."
Such statement was made to The
Herald this afternoon by Dr. J. D.
Taylor of Grand Forks, member of
the board of regents.
Successor Not Named
At the same time, Dr. Taylor de
clared emphatically that the board of
regents had not determined upon Mr.
Worst's successor, statements to the
contrary notwithstanding. The re
ports have linked the names of
Treadwell Twichell, former speaker of
the house of representatives, as well
as that of Franklin L. McVey, presi
dent of the University of North Da
kota with the appointment, but Dr.
Taylor said today that no selection
had been made, and sentiment had
not centered on any individual.
"The North Dakota agricultural
college situation is the first the board
of regents has taken positive steps
in, because it appeared to members
of the board as demanding immediate
action. The step was taken only
after thorough inquiry by members of
the board—each member having spent
some little time personally looking
over the college affairs.
Too Many Heads
"In the past few years, friction has
developed within the college, among
members of the faculty. A number
of "independencies,' as it were, have
grown up within the institution, giv
ing too many heads to it.
Best for Greatest Number
"I will say that the board of re
gents is interested only in that which
is of the greatest benefit to the great
est number of people. We want to
give consideration to every individual
on the college faculty, and I believe
that, by our election of Mr. Worst as
professor emeritus, by which he con
tinues with the college, on salary, we
have shown him the courtesy and
consideration due him for his 20
years' service.
"As for the other members of the
faculty of the college—whether they
have been for or against Mr. Worst,
or whether they have been at logger
heads with other departments within
the college—we will treat all with the
same consideration we have displayed
for Mr. Worst.
"The board of regents is interest
ed solely in the upbuilding of the
agricultural college, just as it is in
terested in the upbuilding and main
tenance of every other institution.
Needs a New Man
"The board of regents, after careful
study, has considered it advisable to
call a new man to the presidency of
the agricultural college—a man who
will be governed solely by the merits
of each proposition as it comes to
him, and who will be entirely free
from entanglements that may have
grown out of service under the pres
ent administration. A man who has
been connected with the college
would, without doubt, find himself
governed in the handling of some
propositions, by his previous affilia
tions within the college.
"Just who that man will be, we do
not at this time know. No choice
has been made.
"To bring about the greatest serv
ice at the agricultural college, every
citizen must recognize the need for
a central governing head. The board
of regents recognizes that proposition,
and will seek to faithfully discharge
its duty.

Cantata The Pixies
By The Schools
BEAUTIFUL PLAY BY 150 CHIL
DREN IN THE AUDITORIUM
SATURDAY, MARCH 4
With a cast of about 150 players,
the Williston graded schools will pre
sent the musical play, The Pixies, one
of the most elaborate children's plays
yet arranged.
The Queen of the Fairies is dis
covered asleep in the forest surround
ed by her Fairies and Attendants, and
while all sleep and as the rising sun
gilds the eastern sky, the Goblins slip
into the forest and bear away Little
Sunshine, the tiniest Fairy and in
their glee anticipate a delightful meal.
While the Queen leaves her throne to
carry a message of good to mortals,
the Fairies unite in a glad festival
of song and the Flowers tell of their
own place in life. After the Butter
flies have entertained the Fairies and
all have sung the dancing song, a
messenger brings word that the Cap
tain of the Pixies, Prince Florimel
and his band are at the shore pre
paring to land, and begs the oppor
tunity of visiting the Court.
But before the brave Pixies arrive,
the Goblins are heard and the Fairies
scamper away in greatest trepidition.
However, at the sound of the
trumpet which announces the coming
of the Pixies, the Goblins rush off
terrified, and soon the Fairies return,
and are delighted to make the ac
quaintance of the Pixies and their
brave leader. For the pleasure of the
Queen and her Fairies, the Prince bids
his Pixie band each to tell the story
of his life, and when Uncle Sam ap
pears with his flag, all join in the
singing of Columbia, the Gem of the
Ocean.
And thus the action continues, full
of many dramatic situations, replete
with bright musical numbers, filled
with many delightfully humorous in
cidents. When, after the conquest of
the Goblins by the Pixie band, the
Amazons, and the Archers, two little
Coons (Mammies's Black Lambs)
bring back Little Sunshine, the cli
max of the evening is attained.
The costumes will represent many
nationalities, the winsomeness of the
Fairies, the daintiness of the But
terflies, the beauty of Flowers, the
royalty of Queen and Prince,
grotesqueness of the Goblins,
weirdness of the Furies will in
pearance alone be of more than or
dinary delight. The music of the
evening, provided by 150 children's
voices, will prove a rare treat to all
lovers of childhood.

The school bespeaks a hearty re
ception and it will, if necessary to ac
comodate its hearers, present the
Cantate a second time. The play will
be presented in The New Auditorium
Saturday night, March 4.
NORTH DAKOTA SUPPORTS
LIQUOR LAW
Washington, Feb. 22.—Attorneys
generals of fifteen states—including
Iowa and North Dakota—filed with
the supreme court a joint argument
in support of the constitutionality of
the West Virginia liquor law, pro
hibiting the receipt and possession of
intoxicating liquors for personal use.
Postponed
Washington, Feb. 22.—Oral argu
ment of the West Virginia liquor cas
es involving constitutionality of the
Webb-Kenyon liquor law, which sub
jects interstate shipments of liquor to
the statutes of the state to which the
liquor is consigned, was indefinitely
postponed yesterday by the supreme
court. The cases, argued first about a
year ago, were restored to the docket
for a second argument.before the en
tire court and had been set for hear
ing yesterday. As there isone vacancy
on the bench and Justice Day is ab
sent on account of illness, they were
again postponed.
TRIP AROUND THE WORLD
The Trip Around the World planned
by the Ladies of the Episcopal Guild
and held last night was quite a novel
ty in the entertaining line afid was
greatly enjoyed by everyone taking
the trip. Leaving the Rawson block
the travelers first visited Germany at
the home of Mrs. George Bruegger,
then on to Ireland at the Elsworth
home and last but not least, back to
the Old U. S. A. at the McKinney
residence. Each home was decorated
with' the national colors of the coun
try they represented and the luncheon
at each place was arranged on the
same plan.
Songs of the various nations were
enjoyed but the striking up of Amer
ica brought everyone to their feet
with cheers for the land of "Liberty."
A noticeable feature of the game
was the persistency of basketshooting
on the part of C. O. Harding, left for
ward of the home team, and the tall
walking of the home center, D. Mar
ston.
The basketball game between the
City team of Stanley, and the Com
munity Center team of this city, of
last Monday evening resulted in an
other victory for the locals, with a
score of 82 to 16.
Lineup of the home team as fol
lows: Forwards—Harding, left and
Cunningham right. Center D. Mar
ston, guards, Bradley and Googedahl,
left, Scott and Tisk, right, Guards
playing half and half of the game,,
with Marwin Marston saving his
talent for the coming contest.
The Stanley line-up was: Center,
Taylor Forwards, Alger and Rayder
Guards, Olson and Lovell one half,
Forsythe one half. C. J. Donaldson is
the Stanley coach.
Stanley has engaged in basketball
this past winter, with the city of
Berthold team, finding them a strong
team, with a weakness for tooting
their own horn. Stanley has decided
that what they need to bring them
down on a level with their fellow
sportsmen is to have them meet the
Community Center team of Williston,
and so they are arranging for a meet
ing of the home team and that of
Berthold at Stanley.
TEACHERS FOR RURAL SCHOOLS
Miss Mary Curran has arrived from
Grafton to take charge of a school
west of Bonetraill.
Francis Keplinger who has been at
tending the university of Indiana has
returned home and will teach a school
in the Round Prairie district.
Miss E. Josephine Peterson of Dris
coll, N. D., will fill the vacancy left in
the school at Howard by A. D. Ams
baugh.
Alfred Erickson of Hoople, N. D.,
a graduate of the Mayville normal
will take a school in the Tandy dis
trict.
Large Gathering
of Odd Fellows
About one hundred and fifty Odd
Fellows attended the district meeting
held in this city last night and enjoy
ed the work as put on by teams made
up of members from various lodges in
the district. About midnight a lunch
eon was served and then the work
of putting on the degrees continued.
The meeting was a fine one in every
way and helped to get the members
of the various lodges better ac
quainted.
Williston Graphic
PONTOON COMPANY
WILL INCORPORATE
$10,000 CONCERN FORMED TO
BRIDGE MISSOURI—PLANS
BEING WORKED OUT
Those Back of Enterprise Confident
of Its Feasability—Will Push
Work
Prospects for a pontoon bridge
across the Missouri at Williston grow
brighter week by week and it would
not be surprising if McKenzie county
people should find themselves com
ing to a Williston fourth of July cele
bration over such a structure.
Company Formed
The small coterie of men who have
pinned their faith to this undertaking
are very much in earnest and have
made substantial progress with their
plans.
At a meeting the past week an or
ganization was effected with R. M.
Calderwood as president, Joseph Weg
ley, vice president, and W. H. Denny,
secy-treas.
Application has been made to the
secretary of state for a charter under
which to incorporate a company with
a capital stock of $10,000.00 divided
into $10.00 shares. Over $1,000.00 of
the stock has already been subscribed.
Local men who keep their finger on
the pulse of capital say they can place
the remainder of the stock on a few
days notice after plans have been
matured.
The bridge is estimated to cost not
to exceed $9,000.00. The Wolf Point
bridge cost $4,500.00 and paid for
itself in one season at a team toll of
35 cents. It is planned to locate the
bridge just below the riprapping op
posite the east end of the island and
moor it by four heavy cables that will,,
extend entirely across the river. Plans
for a road up the bluffs have been
carefully considered.
WILLISTON A WINNER
The game being somewhat onesided
gave the visiting team an opportunity
of showing their sportsmanship,
which they did by fighting to the last
of the game.

Action Declared
Twenty-five men, all that were able
or had interest enough to attend the
business session of the Williston Com
mercial Club called by President
Metzger for Monday evening, without
a dissenting voice said they favored
the paid secretary plan as a means
of making the club an efficient force
for the welfare of the community.
The president called on them in order,
no one being allowed to escape. Most
of the talks were brief but all were
to the point. Some of the strongest
advocates of a change were found
among those wjio have served on the
board of directors the past year.
In the absence of Secretary Mans
field, who was out of town, President
Metzger made a complete report of
the year's business showing that only
a little over four hundred dollars has
been given into the hands of the di
rectors during the year. The report
had all the items of disbursement
and showed a small cash balance on
hand.
Five Directors
The pledge that has been recently
circulated, binding the signers to re
newed effort toward club efficiency,
was read together with the 26 signa
tures. On motion those of the sign
ers who were present were made a
nominating committee to select a list
of names oq which the meeting would
ballot for five directors to fill the ex
l^yxl teyrms. The committee made a
list of 16 names and a few were added
at the suggestion of others.
Twenty-five votes were cast at each
ballot and the first test resulted in the
election of J. W. Jackson with 18 and
J. A. Cunningham with 16, no others
had a majority. After several more
ballots W. H. Westergaard, A. F.
Burk and .C. Wingate were elected.

The board will meet at an early
date for the election of officers.
While the meeting was not large
the spirit was good. It was the
consensus of opinion that the business
men of Williston are not lacking in
liberality or public spirit and need
most of all trained leadership to get
them to working along common lines.
Methods of proceeding toward that ac
quirement was left with the directors.
DEATH OF MISS STUTRUD
Early on the morning of the 22nd
the sad intelligence was conveyed to
her friends that Miss Minda Stutrud
had passed from this life, at the home
of her mother in this city.
Miss Stutrud was born in Villard,
N. D., January 9, 1885. She came to
Williston with her mother in 1901. In
1906 she graduated from the local
high school. For two years she was
principal of the Epworth school and
taught one year in the 5th grade of
Westlawn school Williston. She
was a young woman of high attain
ments and excellent qualities and will
be mourned by a host of friends.
The funeral services will be con
ducted in the Congregational church
Friday afternoon at two o'clock by
Rev. I. G. Monson.
BAND TO GIVE SACRED
CONCERTS I
Sunday, February 27, the Williston
Concert Band will give the first of a
series of sacred concerts at the Lyric
theatre. In giving such a series the
band follows up the custom of sev

this most popular and fitting Sunday
diversion.

F. G. Troppman this week purchas
ed the remainder of the fire damaged
stock of J. D. Wolpert who will re

building that has been occupied by
Mr. Wolpert has been leased by O. E.
O'Dell for his new store.

John Burke Will Run
If Demand Is Made
SAYS: "IF I GO IN IT WILL BE
RESPONSIVE TO DEMAND NOT
FOR SAKE OF AMBITION"
John Burke, treasurer of the Uni
ted States, former governor of North
Dakota, will be forced into the race
for United States senator for North
Dakota at the behest of President
Wilson—because democratic loaders
see in Burke's candidacy an opportu
nity for the displacement of a repub
lican senator.
That is the viewpoint accepted by
democrats throughout North Dakota,
and in furtherance of the scheme,
they will circulate petitions asking
Burke to become such candidate.
They have hopes of getting 10,000
names on the petitions.
The recent announcement by John
Bruegger, national committeeman,
made to the state central committee,
that John Burke had decided to enter
the fight, has been declared by Mr.
Burke to have been untimely. In a
letter to a prominent North Dakota
democrat, Mr. Burke says:
"Of course, it was a mistake to an
nounce my name. It was entirely
without authority and Mr. Bruegger,
I see, has had the same corrected. I
am sincere when I say that I am not
a candidate, and that I do not want
to be a candidate, unless there is a
demand from the people for my serv
ices. I have told this to everyone that
has asked me anything about it.
"There is no reason in the world
why I should get into this fight on
my own account. If I go in, it will
be in response to a demand for my
services, and not for the gratification
of any ambition."
With Burke's position so plainly
stated, the democrats of North Da
kota are determined to create a con
dition that will bring him in—and
next November, they anticipate seeing
the former governor opposing the re
publican nominee, whoever he may
be.
Battle Cry Of Peace
Teaches Great Lesson
Boston Post
For the first time in the history of
the Boston stage a moving picture has
been employed to set forth a public
lesson as well as to provide entertain
ment. "The Battle Cry of Peace,"
which was given its initial perform
ance here yesterday at the Majestic
Theatre, is a powerful call to the
American nation not to go to war but
to be so prepared that international
conflict will be averted. The various
episodes and the connected narrative
have been prepared by Commodore
J. Stuart Blackton, from the book of
Hudson Maxim, "Defenceless Amer
ica."
Spies Advocate Peace
All the incidents, not to say terrible
events, are perfectly possible even if
somewhat improbable, for Mr. Black
ton has laid on his colors with a lav
ish hand and made them tremendously
impressive. It begins with a photo
picture of a lecture by Hiram Maxim
on the lack of military and naval pro
tection in this country and in this
scene the story also begins. A typi
cal young American, John Harrison,
is one of the listerners and is so im
pressed by the truth of the speaker's
statements that he tells his friends
and family what he has heard. They
scoff at his ideas, especially the fath
er of his sweetheart, a railway mag
nate.
There are foreign spies at work
who advocate peace at any price, and
meetings are held in which the white
dove is conspicious. All the time the
enemies of the nation are plotting and
finally, with scarcely a moment's
warning, a foreign fleet appears off
New York, and without further pre
liminaries begins to bombard the city.
The troops are landed. The railroad
magnate is shot as a sniper and the
young man is also wounded. The in
vading hosts destroy private prop
erty, outrage women and pillage and
slaughter relentlessly.

W. S. Davidson Elected To City Com

Majority
With a vote that was light yet as
large as could be expected at a special
election Williston went on record Fri
day as emphatically in favor of sup
porting the auditorium-armory enter
prize with the city's credit and mak
ing it a city and community owned
building. All wards but the fourth
returned large majorities "for" the
$13,500.00 bond issue the proceeds of
which will be used to complete pay
ments on the now almost finished
structure.
By an odd coincidence the totals
received by W. S. Davidson and C. A.
Mattingly, candidates for the vacancy
on the city commission, were exactly
the same, respectively, as the totals
for and against the bonds, these to
tals being 262 and 94. J. B. Lyon was

Progress Toward Base
Ball Organization
Twenty-two good fans and true came
to the base ball meeting set for Tues
day night at H. V. Smith's office. As
such meetings go this was a fine turn
out and several others sent regrets, be
ing unavoidably detained. While wait
ing for late arrivals the past season
was reviewed, mostly with satisfac
tion, and the coming season antici
pated, entirely with confidence.
Last season's secretary-treasurer,
J. .Cutting, made a full financial re
port. This record showed that the
sources of funds were: From sub
scriptions, $1101.75 from gate re
ceipts, $750.55 from purses won,
$619.13 from services of players hired
to other teams, $32.50 from old bal
ance turned in from the "city league,''
$41.00.
The largest item of expenditure was
for players salaries, $1,297.53. The
list of all paid out items is entirely
too long to publish. The statement
showed a deficit of about $15.00 but
a claim against the railroad company
for some $13.00 when received will
practically clean this up.
Permanent improvements, consist
ing of 14 good uniforms, seats at the
grounds and other equipment ,costing
and worth to the club over $200.00,
must be considered as profits on the
season and a nice help toward the
present season's requirements. On
motion of W. J. Kelly a resolution of
commendation on the successful and
efficient management of the 1915 sea
son was unanimously passed. J. P.
Cutting was made secretary of the
meeting and C. L. Marshall chairman*
Plans and players for the present
season were discussed at length and
much enthusiasm and confidence ex
pressed. The idea of employing a
competent playing manager was
heartily endorsed.
With the purpose of making the
business management less burden
some the plan of placing it in the
hands of a board consisting of five
members was favorably considered
and on motion of Mr. Kelly adopted.
By the terms of the motion, which
carried an amendment offered by M.
A. Hegge, the chairman was to be
a member of such managerial board
and the other four were to be select
ed by him. The chairman's protest
at this responsibility went unheeded,
so he announced that the appoint
ments would be made later.
The idea of a small league was con
sidered favorably if enough nearby
towns can be induced to cooperate.
