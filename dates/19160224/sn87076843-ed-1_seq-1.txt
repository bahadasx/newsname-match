FARMERS INSTITUTE
WATER WORKS BOARD
Largo Audiences Listen to Splen
did Lectures by State
Instructors.
On "Wednesday morning the
opening session of the Perrysburg
Farmers' Institute with President
T. H. Tinney as chairman, was at
tended by a splendid audience of
the best class of citizens, who
demonstrated their desire for in
creasing their knowledge in their
chosen field of endeavor by giving
careful attention to the lectures of
the professional instructors pro
vided by the state for that pur
pose. Throughout the entire two days'
session the attendance was un
usually large, and deep interest
Was manifested, showing very
plainly that the men of this local
ity in whose hands the feeding o'f
the world is placed, ao making
every effort to increase their
knowledge along the lines of
greater endeavor.
The farmers of this section of
the county have been taking great
interest in their work and their
splendid ,1'arms and equipment,
their beautiful homes and happy
families are evidence of their pro
gress and success.
The success if this institute indi
cates that another session will fol
low and that our farmer friends
appreciate and improve every op
portunity to gather information
that will enable them to increase
usefulness and importance as pro
ducers of world necessities.
It is to be hoped that our farm
ers will organize a local club or
association and hold meetings
every month for the purpose of
social greetings and the discussion
of subjects of local interest. Such
meetings would be of great benefit
from every point of view and will
result in an exchange of ideas that
will be of great mutual benefit.
There will be six graduates from
Perrysburg high school this year.
The officers are as follows:
President, Carleton Finkbeiner;
vice-president, Josephine Davis;
secretary, Myrtle Frantz; treas
urer, Raymond Spilker
Miss Gladys Simmons has been
chosen as class poet; Gertrude
Schuster as class prophet and
Carleton Finkbeiner as class his
torian. The colors chosen are
dark green and white and the class
flower is the white rose. The
class sermon will be delivered Sun
day morning, May 28, in the Pres
byterian church by Dr. William
H. Pheley.
The commencement exercises
will be held June 2 in the high
school auditorium. Dr. John
Davison, vice president of Ohio
Northern University, will deliver
the address.

Concerning Nothing Very Serious
But Worthy of Thought.
"Whatever opinion one may have
had of ex-President Roosevelt as it
candidate in 1912 does not blind
him to the fact that the Colonel is
a "wise old owl" in matters of
national importance, and in his
late book, among the millions of
things he says, we find the follow-'
ing on preparedness:
"We have been signal in our remiss
ness to prepare for our own defense.
It is our highest duty thus to prepare
and in manful fashion to pay the cost
of preparation. Seven years ago we
were relatively to the rest of the world
far better prepared than ever before in
our history.-
"We have let our navy deteriorate
to a degree both shameful and alarm
ing. We have shown by our own, con
duct when the Hague conventions were
violated that all such treaties are ut
terly worthless as offering even the
smallest safeguard against aggression.
"Eighteen months have gone by
since the great war broke out.
"Yet during these eighteen months
not one thing has been done. At this
moment we are no stronger by one sol
dier or one sailor, by one cannon or one
ship, because of anything that has been
done during these eighteen months in
view of the frightful world calamity
that has befallen.
"Never in the country's history has
there been a more stupendous instance
of folly than this crowning folly of
waiting eighteen months after the ele
mental crash of nations took place be
fore even making a start in an effort
and an utterly inefficient and insuffi
cient effort for some kind of prepar
ation to ward off disaster in the fu
ture." Schools and colleges throughout
the entire country are introducing
military training, largely for the
purpose of physical development
of the pupils, as well as to teach
them how to defend themselves
and their country in time of war,
which may come at any time. Per
rysburg schools should not be be
hind the times, and if the Board of
Education can see their way clear
to introduce the system it will not
be difficult to find those who will
direct the training with no re
muneration except the good to be
accomplished.
It is really wonderful how much
brain matter is being burned up
in an effort to regulate Avoman's
apparel by legislation. "The pro
tection of men's morals" from the
"influence" of low necks, short
skirts and transparent gowns are
assigned as reasons for the "fash
ion fight." Really it's quite sick-
ening. The man who is so weak
! that the sight of the female form
leads him astray, has no "morals"
worthy of protection. Everybody

Used Chamberlain's Couirh
Remedy for 20 Years.
"Chamberlain's Cough Remedy has
been used in my household for the
past twenty years. I began giving
it to my children when they were
small. As a quick relief for croup,
whooping cough, and ordinary colds,
it has no equal. Being free from
opium and other harmful drugs, I
never felt afraid to give it to the
children. I have recommended it to
a largo number of friends and neigh
bors, who have 'ised it and speak
highly or it." writes Mrs. Mary Mm-

probably have a candidate now.
So says a dispatch from San
dusky to the Toledo Blade.
This announcement makes good
reading for Republicans of Wood
County as it opens a fight among
the Democrats of this district
which may result in givng the Re
publicans a chance to win.
In this respect the Republicans
of Wood county are deeply inter
ested. Already Wood county has two
prospective candidates Mr. Chas.
A. Hatfield and Mr. Franklin P
RiegIcr both of Bowling Green,
each of whom claims the right of ,
appearing as a candidate and re
ceiving the support of the 'county, i
Mr. Hatfield was the Republi
can candidate against Mr. Over-:
myer two years ago and was de-,
feated by a small plurality. He
now claims the right of again be
ing the candidate and claims many
friends throughout the county who
desire to support him.
Mr. Reigle has announced his
candidacy as backed by a strong
following, claiming his chances for
the election are better than those
of Mr. Hatfield, and his activity
in campaigning is having its effect
in various parts of the district.
The situation for the voter who
feels friendly toward both men is
unpleasant. He "could be happy
with either," etc., is very true in
this case.
Both men are capable and could
ably fill the position with credit to
the county and district but unless
harmony can be secured it is ques
tionable if either can win.
Bowling Green politicians some
times "spill the beans" by having
: too many in the bag, and unless
! the "wise men" of the county seat
town get togctner ana compro
mise on one man, it will be nec-

settle the
' question at the primaries.

HOW TO CURE COLDS,
Avoid exposure and drafts. Eat

Dr. King's New Discovery kills and

Perrysburg System Now Supplies
Water to 283 Consumers.
A meeting of the Water Works
Board was held " Wednesday.
Messrs. Braun, Voitch, Williams
and the cleric present.
The election of a superintendent
was one of the important matters
for consideration, and there were
a number of applicants for the
position. The board elected the
present superintendent at a salary
of $75 per month, an increase of
$15 per month over the salary
heretofore paid.
Plans are being perfected to give
a day and night service, so there
may be at all times a full pressure
in the water lines.
Other improvements are being
contemplated which will give' Per
rysburg a first-class service.
There are now 2S3 connections
with the lines and it is hoped many
more may be added. The cost for
lawn service is only $0.00 per year.
The only money the board has
for use in extending lines will be
that obtained from water rents
after all expenses are paid.
Further extensions will be made as
soon as the board lias funds that
can be used for that purpose.

BOY'S CARELESSNESS
Nearly Results in Fatal Injuries at
Rossford.
On Tuesday afternoon last as
Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Rheinfrank
were driving through Rossford an
accident occurred that may prove
fatal to a Rossford youth.
The boy, Artie Rossler, aged 12,
wa's "hanging on" the rear end of
a wagon as it was passing down
the street, and j ust as the auto
mobile driven by Mr. Rheinfrank
was about to pass the wagon the
boy darted across the street di
rectly in front of the auto, and
was struck and badly injured.
Mr. Rheinfrank stopped his car
as soon as possible and bonveyed
the boy to the nearest doctor's of
fice, and then immediately came
to Perrysburg for Dr. W. H.
Rheinfrank who hastened to Ross
ford and had the boy conveyed to
the Rheinfrank hospital in Perrys
burg where every effort is being
made in his behalf, with indica
tions of his complete recovery.
The case is one of carelessness
and one that could not be avoided
by the driver of the auto.
Children who play in the street
are a constant menace to them
selves and to those who must use
the street for driving.
