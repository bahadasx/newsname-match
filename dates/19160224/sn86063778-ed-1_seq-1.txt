* TWO QUARTS A MONTH;
SIXTY PINTS OF BEER
At Saturday's session of the
general assembly the South Carona
whiskey law was amended
with a provision allowing: only
two quarts a month to be shipped
to any individual in this state,
instead of one gallon as formerly.
The amended law, however, permits
one to have 60 bottles of
beer shipped in each month.
The free conference report on
the two quart a month bill, submitted,
Friday night, struck out
section 10, which required a man
if he carries whiskey in a grip,
to paste a label on the outside
stating how much whiskey ine
grip contains. The free conference
also struck out the word "receive,"
as the original bill prohibited
a man from giving his
friend a drink. The section provision
prohibiting non-residents
from getting whiskeav while in
this state was also stricken out.
The bill as finally adopted allows
each resident of the state to or
der two quarts of whiskey or
five dozen bottles of beer per
month. As soon as the bill is
signed by the governor it will
become law.
State Wins Point.
The supreme court of the United
States Monday rendered a
decision which in effect declared
that the South Carolina dispensary
liquor law was constitutional.
The decision was in the appeal
of the Carolina Glass company,
which company is charged
with conspiracy in that the members
conspired with the members
of the state dispensary board to
^ overcharge for bottles bought
from the company. In answering
the allegation the company
contended that the law under
which the state took charge of
the money owed the company by
the county dispensaries was unconstitutional.
The court held
otherwise.
Bust Insurance Monopoly?
After a short fieht on third
reading, the majority cutting off
debate, the house Friday afternoon
gave final passage to the
Laney anti-compact ihsurance
bill on a yea and nay vote of
63 to 33. A motion to recommit
was lost, 65 to 31.
This bill produced the only
filibuster of this session of the
general assembly when by
reason of the continuous unanimity
of 11 members seven hours
were consumed in roll call and
matters of personal privilege at
the session Thursday night,
which adjourned at 3:20 o'clock
Friday morning.
Earth Shock Tuesday.
South Carolina, j&dong with
Virginia, North Carolina and
ijeorgia, was visited at 6:40
o'clock Monday evening by an
earlh tremor which was very
p rceptibly felt and which,
locally, produced for an instant
the usual consternation attendant
upon such events. The shake
lasted only a fraction of a minute
but buildings quivered and electric
swinging lamps swayed so
noticeably that the strange feeling
produced by such occasions
was abiding in the breasts of
the populace. No damage has
thus far been reported from the
shock.
9 The earthquake was the first
that has been noted in this community
since January 1, 1012.
Prior to that time this section
had not quivered under the influence
of such a tremor since
1886 which was the year of the
Charleston outburst, the most
violent in the history of this
part of the country.

BUT STILL SHE BEGS
(Rock Hill Herald, Friday.)
Wearing: a shabby looking: long
black coat, shabby dress, a hat
fashioned in the nineties (?) and
with a wrinkled and care-worn
appearance, over which a pall jf
sadness had descended, Maggie
Wilson, general beggar-nuisrnce,
boarded the noonday trait, and
sworse she would neve again
set her foot in Rock Hil' There
was a reason.
Known to the polir ? of the two
states and pro1 ably others,
Maggie is a .^gular nuisance,
one th?f extremely hard to get
riu ot'. For years she has been
plying her profession and as a
consequence is an actress of no
mean anility, insotar as her art
is concerned. She goes to a
home and the appeal of tears in
her voice and a well figured expression
of direst need on her
seamy visage are calculated to
melt the heart 01 an adamant.
And she usually succeeds, though
not every time. Sometimes she
is referred to the Associated
Charities. On such occasions,
her appealing voice suddenly
changes and she retorts something
like this "Lookahere, I
have broken two umbrellas over
the heads of women telling me
to go to the Sass-ciated Charities."
Maggie had $9 in greenbacks
and $32.20 in pennies, nickles.
dimes and quarters when caught
this morning. She also had a
bank book on a Columbia savings
bank, showing a balance of
$828.88. Chief Youngblood required
her to put up a ten dollar
bond for her appearance to
answer the charge of begging.
Then did Maggie adopt her appealing
attitude. Appearing
hysterical she moaned "I'll kill
myself, please don't take m\
money, I will starve, I worked
so hard lor it. It is all I have,"
and considerable more of the
same "soft stuff." But she had
confronted the chief before. If
you ever come here again, he
told her I will ovori- pant
you have, bank book and all,
and keep .\ou in jail. She had
been detained after several people
had complained of her actions,
w hich are nothing less than
a nuisance. And besides she
has already considerably more
than the $37.50 which is the per
capita of the citizens of the
U. S.t and consequently does
not need to beg.
Mag said she was extremely
sorry she struck Rock Hill. It
cost me more than I got, she
avered. She seems to have
a mania for begging and evidently
hoards all she gets.
Will Exchange Pulpits.
Through a plan formulated a
few days ago, the Baptist ministers
of the county will within the
next month exchange pulpits
with each other, the first exchange
to be made on next Sunday.
The Fort Mill churches
will on next Sunday be served
by Rev. W. J. Nelson, of Rock
Hill, who will preach at Flint Hill
at 11 a. m. and at the church in
this city at 7 p. m. Rev. S. P.
Hair, of this city, will in turn
fill the pulpits of Rev. Mr. Nelson
at Rock Hill in the morning and
evening.
W. B. Byers, better known to
his friends as "Bill," states that
he will be in the race this year
for the office of Clerk of

! SESSION OF ASSEMBLY
ADJOURNED SUNDAY
The second session of the
seventy-first general assembly
of South Carolina was brought
to a close at an early hour Sunday
morning. The session had
been in progress 40 days and
had been marked by only a few
fights or unnecessary wranglings.
The state tax levy was
reduced from 7 mills to 61-2
mills.
Inasmuch as this summer
members of the house must go
before the people of their
respective counties in seeking
reelection, the progress of legislation
in the lower branch was
frequently interrupted by members
who voiced their farewells
in appropriate terms.
With the exception of heated
remarks in connection with
various anti-liquor hills and the
filibuster aga:nst the anti-compact
'*ill the session was one
carried on with decorum. The
session saw much local legislation
enacted, as well as practically all
the administration measures.
Prohibition bills generally were
passed with amendments.
Important Work of Assembly.
Among the more important
measures enacted by the legislature
at the session that closed
Sunday morning were the Mc
uuiiouRh child lat>or bill; the
Toole-LaGrone bill to teach agfriculture
in the common schools;
the Torrens system of land registration;
the creation of a board
of conciliation; a bill relating: to
hours of labor and the amending:
of the militia laws.
