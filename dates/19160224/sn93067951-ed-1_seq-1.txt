A Weekly Keview
Of The Great War
There is a decided renewal of
activity on the western frodt in
France, but with no decisive results
so far as can be learned.
We are yet in the dark as to
whether this portends a serious
offensive on either side, and if
so, in what quarter. So far as
the operations have developed
they seem to be merely intended
to gain more defensible posif
lotions in readiness for a supreme
' efFort in the spring. The battlefields
are the same as laRt fall;
namely, the hills that lie to the
west oT Lille in the Artois region
and to the east of Rheims
in the Champagne.
It has been repeatedly stated
f liO f. n? Vao f n t? o r t Ko Ant/?/\rv*r? ^ ?
vuwu ?? iji?uv> ? v, i I 1IU uuivwiuu Ui
the war the fate of Turkey is
sealed. In the future Turkey
^ ' will remain under the dominion
1 of either the Teutonic powers or
will be partioned among the En\
tente Allies.
With the fall of Erzerum bei
fore Russian hosts a long step is
iA made by the Allies toward the
subjugation of the unspeakable
Turk.
It was at first reported that
100,000 soldiers were captured
when this stronghold fell, but it
|^Hhas since developed that most of
^^Bthe Turkish army escaped and
J^Rue being pursued by the Rus[^^Pjians.
\ A Turkish division has been
Vmpletely wiped out or captnr^
\ in the tlight from Erzerum,
yording to an official statement
' bed in Petrograd. Other
|F" un*ls ^ave suffered
"" "liie Russians are launching
fierce attacks against Turkish
forces at Sivas, about 16 miles
west of Erzerum. Sivas is a
height which is held iu strength
by the Turks.
Unofficial dispatches from Petrograd
state that the entire
Turkish line in the Black Seu
and Lake Van region hus retired
for a distance of more than 80
miles.
In the assault on Erzeruin, a
single Russian corps captured
240 guns.
In the first line forts alono 132
guns, mostly of new Krupp models,
were taken.
Great quantities of ammunition
and supplies of all kinds
fell into the hands of the Russians.
Official computation of
the prisoners and material captured
has not been completed.
This is the severest blow Turkey
has suffered during this war.
It probably opens the way to a
march on onstantinonle from
the rear.
Mr. Stevenson's Views
The last statement made by
Mr. W..F. Stevenson as to what
? *?^>ngress should do for a farming
district like this was that it had
spent $475,000,000.05 on rivers
and nothing on roads. It has already
spent $100,000,000 on irrigation
projects, to water lands
fur less than 1,000,000 people in
the West. Why not do some
thing to take the water out ol
the roads in the South?
In South Carolina the State
ana v;ount>ieB anu iuwii?<np>
spent in 1914 about $1,000,000.00
on roads, and still of the 45,049
nules of roads in the Slate on!.\
4,88H miles aro surfaced and
really improved?and that is the
work of years. 4^,661 miles arc
to be Axed, al?d ftH nnnst be
V^ftintained. The Government
carries mail over most of them;
why it it not right for it*to help
fix them?

liood Local Bills

' , " \
Chesterfield's legislative delegation
took a very prominent
part in the work of state-wide
interest that was transacted at
this session, but they al^o found
time to attend to some very im-'
portant local matters.
Following aie somo of the local
measures enacted :
A bill allowing each township
to vote a 6 mill tax for a period
not exceeding five years for the
purpose of raisii g money for
school buildings.
A bill providing for the selection
of township commissioners
by popular election.
A bill providing that all
claims against the county shall
be filed one day before the meeting
of the board of commissioners.

commissioners, and road
overseers from contracting for or
doing any of the work over
which he or they may have sup
ervision.
A bill reauiring commission
ers to file quarterly reports with
itemized statement of expenses
with county board of commissioners
and to publish same in u
newspaper in the county.
All money paid to township
commissioner?*must be paid out
by them and not by road over
seers.
The question of changing or
continuing the present rural police
system is to be submitted
to the people for settlement by
ballot.
Legislature Adjourns
The 2910 session of the State
legislature adjounred Sunday
morning at 5 :?15.
The Torrens system of land

this session. The working of
this important law will be exnlninarl

What is considered one of the
foremost steps in making South
Carolina an agricultural State
was the enactment of the bill
by Messrs. Toole; and LaGrone to
provide for the teaching of agriculture
in the public schools,
the authors of the bill started
modestly with an appropriation
of $f>.000. It was urged that the
inculcation of agricultural knowledge
at an early age would prove
a great impetus for general rural
development.
Mrs. Raley Entertains
Mrs. M. L. Haley was a charming
hostess when she entertained
recently in honor of Mrs. J.
S, McGregor.
The Valentine idea was carried
out most effectively in the
decorations. Numeious gay cupids
and hearts suggested love
time. In an attractive register
the guests wrote the autographs,
uid in dainty heart shaped booklets
expressed their wishes for
Mrs. McGregor. The indites de
cided Unit Miss Grace llurst of
Chesterfield, most pleasingly recorded
her wishes for the bride's
future and she was the recipient
of the dainty prize.
The hostess presented Mrs.
McGregor with a beautiful cut
glass bon bon dish and each
guest with, a charming souvenir
of this very happy occasion.
Chesterfield, Mt. Oroghan and
Wadesboro were represented.

Chesterfield Delegates
Save State Warehouse
One of the most exciting and
momentous fights of t.he present
session of the general assembly
has been that of Warehouse
Commissioner McLaurin against
the Southeastern Tariff association.
The Southeastern Tariff associft
f.1 An 10 a r?a f' /n? U ? b- ? ^ * ?
io ? iii<j iire in~
surance association ihat regulates
and controls tire insurance
rates throughout the United
States.
When Senator McLaurin,
through arrangements he was
able to make with independent
insurance men north, began cutting
the rates of the Southeastern
Tariff association to pieces,
the Southeastern Tariff association
put in operation the machinery
it employs in such canes
with a view to putting the senator
out of business. The purpose
of the big tru*t was unmistakable,
and Mr. McLaurin realized
at once that he would have
to either surrender or fight, and
he chose to fight.
Mr. McLaurin went after the
enemy and the Senate passed
Mr. G. K, Latiey's bill along the
line desired placing the entire
question of rale making on lire
risks in South (Carolina under
the control of the Warehouse
a
Com missioner.
The senate acted before the
insurance people knew wiiat was
doiifg, and tney did not get fair
lv into action before the I ill had
been sent over to the h -use; but
during Tuesday and Wednesday
of last week, the insurance lobby
came swarming down on the
situation like the locusts of
Egypt, and they made things
warm.
It is said that there were more
than two hundred insurance men
in Columbia on Tuesday and
Wednesday, and telegrams poured
in on members from all over
the country bv the hundred.
On passing the Senate this bill
was referred to the insurance
committee, but Mr. W.P. Odotn,
a staunch friend of the warehouse
system hail it referred to
the agriculture committee, of
which he is chaiiman.
Both sides were here given a
fair hearing. The prompt and
edicient work o f Chesterfield
County's representatives have
undoubtedly saved to the State
and its farmers the benefits of
the State Warehouse System.
At The AmusU
To-night., Thursday, a threereel
feature, Ella Hall, in "Beth
Bides of Life," will be shown.
This is one of the very best.
Saturday night "The Trail of
the Upper Yukon," featuring
Ben Wilson and Dorothy Philips,
will be exhibited. Also a cuereel
picture, "Who's There."
This will constitute an excellent
entertainment.
On Tuesday night will be seen
the seventh episode of the
"Perils of Pauline." Those who
failed to eee the sixth episode
missed the most thrilling picture
yet shown. The seventh will be
better still.
It is worth mentioning that
the lights are now fine and overthing
is sure to work smoothly
in the future.

of ltuby are looking forward to is

Don't Be Angry
We are this week and next
sending out about one thousand
statements to subscribers who
are in arrears on subscription.
Some people think It their duty
to get mad when presented
with a statement of account but
we trust none of our subscribers
will look at the matter in that
light this time.
The universal rule with all
publications requires subscriptions
to be paid in advance. The
rapidly advancing prices of paper
and other supplies compels
us to put this rule in force be
fore summer.
