BASE BALLBANQUET
Large and Enthusiastic Gathering of
Fans Dines at the I. O. O. F.
Hall Thursday Evening.
Plans for 1916 DiscussedProspects
for a Winning Team in Prince-
ton Were Never Brighter.
Judging by the enthusiasm that
flowed from the hundred and thirty
fans in attendance at the base ball
banquet at the I. 0. 0. F. hall last
Thursday evening, prospects for, a
successful 1916 season on the dia
mond are exceedingly bright. Good
will and loyalty to the base ball boys
predominated, and the banquet was a
splendid success, surpassing even the
one of a year ago.
At 7 o'clock the earlier arrivals at
the hall put in an appearance, and the
-attendance was constantly increased
until at 9 o'clock a large and happy
gathering of fans was in evidence.
The banquet proper did not commence
until the last named hour, and the in
tervening time was whiled away with
cards in the Masonic lodge room.
The doors to the banquet hall were
thrown open by Director Morton short
ly after 9, and two tables, stretching
across the entire length of the room,
with a table bridging the two at the
east end, greeted the eyes of those
present. Eatables abundance rest
ed upon the tables and the fans just
naturally gravitated to their seats.
Members of the high school basket
ball team acted as table waiters, and
their "passing"featured as usual. Miss
Lola Scheen presided at the piano and
rendered several pleasing selections.
Considerable time was devoted to sat
isfying the "inner man," and then
toasts were in order. First, however,
a quartet composed of Nathan Peter
son, Jay Wmsor, Lemuel Briggs and
Joe Kaliher, favored those present
with vocal selections well rendered.
Attorney E. L. McMillan was to ha IQ
acted as toastmaster, but was unable
to be present, as professional busi
ness in Minneapolis required his at
tention. H. J. Plaas consented to act,
however, and punctuated his remarks
with characteristic pleasantries.
Attorney S. P. Skahen was called
upon to open this feature of the even
ing's entertainment, and responded by
outlining what the base ball boys ex
pert from the public. He called atten
at the outset to the fact that a dozen
business firms of the village have do
nated that number of uniforms, and
as there is a cash balance in the
treasury there was no need for alarm
on the part of the banquetershe was
not paving the way for a "touch."
Briefly stated the boys merely expect
liberal attendance at the games, and
rie vocal support of the fans. This
they are assured of. Mr. Skahen also
announced that the management had
decided to charge ladies for admis
sion to the grounds the coming sea
son. This decision was not reached
hastily, and this action is necessary if
financial worries are to be eliminated
All of last season the team operated
on an extremely narrow margin, de
spite the fact that the rigidest econ
omy was exercised at all times, and
had it not been for the fact that auto
mobiles were placed at the disposal of
the boys without charge upon various
occasions there is no doubt but what a
deficit in the treasury would have re
sulted. The ladies will not be charged
full price, however, the fee having
established at 15c.
4 ft Later in the evening Mr. Skahen
Ibrought up the question of week-day
ball games, there being sentiment fa
vorable to this in some quarters. No
action was taken in the matter, but the
plan may be tried when the season
opens.
Dr. L.B.Mallette, captain of the ball
team, followed Mr. Skahen, and out
lined what the fans can expect from
the team. He stated that all of last
year's stars with the exception of Em
ahiser would be available again this
year, and briefly reviewed the 1915
performance of the boys, doing jus
tice to all the players except one
himself. Last season the Princeton
ball team made a record of which it
can well feel proud, and its work was
more than gratifying to the fans. The
indications are that it will do fully
as well or even better during 1916.
Several of the youngsters of the vil
lage are displaying more than ordin
ary ability in the national pastime,
and Captain Mallette announced that
all would be given a chance to earn
a place on the team. Merit alone will,
as in the past, govern the selection of
players.
The toastmaster then called upon
Mayor Newbert,andhis response made
Historical Soci
a decided hit with those present. He
stated in cordial terms his approval
of the great American game, and
promised the boys his unqualified sup
port. Marshal Wilkes is the main
spoke in the ball team, and the may
or's stand was greeted with an en
thusiastic outburst of applause. A
base ball team minus a pitcher, unlike
a Ford without an engine, won't run
on its reputation.
The following were called upon by
the toastmaster also, and in brief re
sponses voiced their loyalty to the
team: J. J. Skahen, D. A. McRae, G.
A. Eaton, E. K. Evens, R. D. Byers,
Guy Ewing, Fred Newton, A. G. Os
terberg and J. E. Yngve. "Pongo"
Olsen also responded to an insistent
clamor on the part of the fans for a
speech, by expressing the apprecia
tion of the management for the en
thusiasm and good will shown. Claire
Smith, last season's popular captain,
was called upon, but evidently pre
ferred to "blush unseen," and an ef
fort to have J.W.Mossman uncorck his
eloquence, also failed. Last year,
when called upon, Joe said he was "too
full for utterance," and the toastmast
er concluded he was to full to e/en
say this, Thursday evening.
Those present unanimously voted
the affair the best ever, and it was a
harmonious gathering that will tend
to cement closer the brotherhood of
Princeton fans, including the "leather
lunged" enthusiasts who congregate
along the first-base hne, and those
who view the games through the wind
shield of an automobile.
The boys did not expect to more
than break even on the affair, but $7
was realized, and this sum goes into
the treasury.
Boys Defeated.
Co. G's crack basket ball team must
have absorbed too much "hot air" at
the base ball banquet Thursday even
ing, as, in the last half of a contest
with the speedy Ascension Cubs of
Minneapolis at the Armory Friday ev
ening, it blew its scoring machine all
to smithereens, and the Cubs annexed
the long end of a 38 to 21 score.
It started out like a real game and
during the first half Monsieur Hofflan
der's stars more than held their own.
Smith was in great form, and nego
tiated a total of 4 field goals during
this round, while Captain -Morton -aW
wafted the sphere through the net for
a goal, and took three free throws
at the net that counted. During this
time the visitors secured 6 goals, and
when the period ended the count stood
13 to 12 in favor of the soldier boys.
The last half was a rather woozy
exhibition from a local viewpoint. The
down river athletes rolled up a total
of 26 points, while Smith for the
team located the net twice, and Morton
and Wilkes counted once eachmak
ing a total of 8 for Princeton during
this period. During the final minutes
of play Newton was injured, and
Raiche went as left forward. Doane,
who was ill, did not participate at all,
and his absence undoubtedly weakened
the locals.
No athletic team can be expected to
go at top speed at all times. They all
have off days, and the boys are no
exception. For the season they have
a very creditable record, and their
work on the whole has been truly grat
ifying.
A dance was given after the game,
and a goodly crowd remained, all of
whom report a delightful time.
Notice to Parents.
Parents having children whom they
desire to enroll in the kindergarten
class are requested to leave the names
and ages of such children with Miss
Tompkins at the Whittier building.
This must be done at once, otherwise
they may not be accepted. The num
ber of pupils we can accommodate is
limited, hence selections will be made
strictly in accordance with age. This
class begins &hool on March 6.

Fire Lossesn Mille Lacs County.
The need ofa more general adoption
of fire prevention methods in Mille
Lacs county shown by the annual
report issued'by Robert W. Harga-'
dine, State Fire Marshal, of fires in
this county during the year ended
December 31, 1915.
There were 13 fires during tjie year
and the loss was $94,180. This is
greater, both in the number of fires
and in the aggregate losses as com
pared with 1914. In that year the
losses in Mille Lacs county were $45.-
131.
However, the number of fires and
the aggregate loss for the past

shows that just a little more care in
the elimination of fire hazards and a
little more general appreciation of the
need of fire prevention will place Mille
Lacs county in the ranks of those
whose losses were reduced during the
past year.
The Editors' Convention.

able addresses were delivered. It was
one of the best and most profitable

ally, and that splendid hotel, the Rad
isson, cared for their creature wants
in fine shape.

School Romance Culminates.
The culmination of a pretty romance
dating back to the time when the prin
cipals were schoolmates in Princeton,
occured at the St. Louis rectory, St.
Paul, Tuesday morning when Mr. Jesse
L. Angstman of Harlem, Mont., and
Miss Laurena M. Jesmer of Princeton
took the matrimonial vows, in the
presence of near relatives. Miss Esther
Angstman, sister of the groom, acted
as bridesmaid, while the groom was at
tended by Lester Jesmer, brother of
the bride.
Mr. and Mrs. Angstman left yester
day for Montana, where the groom has
charge of the United States land office
at Harlem, and that place will be their
home.
The bride is an accomplished and
charming young lady, whose winning
ways have endeared her to a large
circle of friends, one and all of whom
"wrislr-her nothing but happiness fcrthe
years that lie ahead. The groom is a
bright young man of sterling worth,
who is meeting with deserved and
marked success in life. Here in Prince
ton he numbers his friends by his ac
quaintances, and his acquaintances are
extremely numerous. His pathway in
life will indeed lie along pleasant lines
if well wishes can so make it.

SPUD MARKET DROPS
Farmers Hauling Freely, and Prices
DeclineLocal Receipts and
Shipments are Heavy.
Seed Potato Deal Red River Ohios
Now Under Way Texas
Planting Season Opens.
The potato market has gradually
weakened the past few weeks, and Sat
urday witnessed another drop of 5c per
bushel. Since then from 60c to 65c has
been paid for all varieties except Tri
umphs, which remain firm around the
$1 mark. Receipts have been fairly
heavy each day.
The outside demand has been good,
especially in seed stocks and since the
last issue of the Union 61 cars of spuds
have been shipped from here. On Sat
urday 24 cars left the Princeton depot,
on Tuesday 23 cars were shipped, and
today 15 will leave this point.
The weaker tone in the market ap
pears to be general, due undoubtedly
to the fact that favorable weather con
ditions in all sections have permitted
farmers to haul more freely. Receipts
at Chicago last week were double those
of the week previous, and there were
127 cars on the track the first two days
of the week.
The eastern potato situation remains
unchanged. Eastern growers hold out
steady for $1 per bushel at loading sta
tion, hence receipts from farmers are
growing very light.
Reports received'by the Chicago
Packer show that the movement of
Red River Early Ohio seed potatoes is
fully two weeks later than usual, and
only started last week. Holdings in
Clay county are estimated to be 50
cars in excess of last year but this is
not a fair estimate of the entire valley.
All along the line north of Clay coun
ty as far as Crookston the production
was cut down last year by water, with
the result that certain stations in that
section have not enough potatoes left
for their needs for seed and table pur
poses. Prices on Red Rivers were a bit
firmer last week because of the im
proved demand for seed and the mar
ket ranged from 92c to 95c a bushel,
sacked, at valley stations.
Pctato planting in Texas is gener
ally under way throughout the potato
belt. One*planter, who is considered
a comparatively small grower, had 26
hands busy last week cutting pota
toes, while other planters are employ
ing hundreds of men. Considerable
seed already is in the ground, and
prospects are bright for a fine crop of
potatoes.
Dr. A. G. Aldrich.
After a brave struggle for life, Dr.
A. G. Aldrich passed away at his home
in Anoka last Saturday morning.
About ten days previous to his death
he had contracted a severe cold which
speedily developed into pneumonia. Dr.
H. C. Cooney of this place was in al
most constant attendance and from the
first entertained but faint hopes of
Dr. Aldrich's recovery.
Dr. Aldrich was a native of Berk
shire county, Massachusetts, and was
about 60 years of age. He studied
medicine in several eastern colleges,
and graduated from the Baltimore Col
lege of Physicians and Surgeons in
1879. For a time he practiced in Mas
sachusetts. He came west in the early
eighties and located in Anoka, with of
fices in that city and Minneapolis. Lat
er he took post graduate courses in
eastern schools and also in Europe. He
specialized in eye, ear and throat work,
ranked high in his profession and had
a large and lucrative practice.
Shortly after graduating he was
married to Miss Flora L. Southard of
Westford, N. Y. Although no children
blessed their union he and his esti
mable wife were devotedly attached to
each other and remained lovers to the
end. Mrs. Aldrich survives him and
she has the sincere sympathy of a host
of friends throughout the state in her
great bereavement.
Dr. Aldrich was truly one of
nature's noblemen. He had every trait
of character that endears^one to his
friends. He will be sadly missed, and
among those who will cherish his mem
ory as long as life lasts is the writer
of these lines.

Ed Page is No More.
It will be with feelings of genuine
regret that the old-timers of the Rum
River Valley will learn of the death of
Edward S. Page, which occurred at
Seattle, Wash., on the 26th ult.
Mr. Page was a native of Maine and
was born March 14, 1843. After the
civil war, in which he fought under
gallant Phil Sheridan, he came west,
located in Anoka and engaged in the
lumber business. In connection with
his brother, Charles, he operated in
the Rum River pineries for many
years, and was well and favorably
knownjo all the old settlers in Prince
ton and vicinity. Later he went south
and for a number of years was en
gaged in the lumber business at
Shreveport, La. About ten years ago
he removed to Seattle.
Mr. Page is survived by his wife,
a daughter and a sonthe latter,
Arthur D. Page, resides at Hines in
this state.
Pay-Up Week.
This is pay-up week throughout the
length and breadth of Minnesota.
Many of the newspapers contain page
advertisements by local business,
houses calling attention to the fact
in nicely worded cards. But there is
nothing in that line doing here.
Nevertheless, it would be a good thing
if every one in this vicinity made a
special effort to get square with the
world this week. Get out of debt and
keep out of debt if possible.
New Postoffice at Anoka.
Anoka people are jubilant over the
letting of the contract for a post
office building at that place. The con
tract price is $41,250. The exterior
of the structure is to be of limestone
and granite. The building is to be
located on Main street and Third
avenue, and is to be completed by
May 15, 1917. The Union congratu
lates the Anokaites on their good
fortune.
