Eight Hours a Day. I
At the last moment Representative it ]
Borland offered his amendment to S?
change the law which states that the
government clerk in Washington shall
work not less than seven hours, so as ^
to read "not less than eight hours a c!*
day." The act to be changed is that of
March 15, 189H; and the President already
has the authority to increase ***<
the hours of labor if necessary. "c
There was a vigorous discussion. So1
Representative Borland said he had
urged the matter before now, and had j ,e"
figured a saving to the government of
? $4,000,000 a year. Representative Staf- erf
ford and Representative Burns both
told the committee that the subcom- t*1*
mittee bad not even considered the me
matter and that it should not l?e plastered
on the bill without serious study. res
Representative Mondell of Wyoming j
had gone to the House floor as debate |^?-v
bad started, but be was sent for. He c<*r
opposed the innovation and called for a | ?,.
division when a vote was called. No
records were kept of the executive ses- i fee>
sion vote, but it is learned that Representative
Bvrns and Representative ___
Mondell were the only two whose ?
bands were counted in the negative, op- ?
posed to the Borland amendment. Representative
Stafford did not vote.
Representative Borland was asked
late this afternoon why hp had introduced
his amendment and be replied:
"Government employes all over the
country are glad enough to get an
eight-hour day and believe the government
is very good to them not to make !
them work more than eight hours, so I
see no reason why government' em- 1
?r^ in me lusmct of (Columbia I
should work only seven hours. The ]
committee understands that when the 1
amendment is drafted in final shape it I
will rover not only the executive de- 1
jiartments. but every government emI
# plove in the city of Washington. arid I I
believe it will cover the employes of
the District building."
Appropriates $37,601,539.25.
t arrying a total of $37,601,539.25, the
legislative, executive and judicial appropriation
bill, the big pay roll of the
government departments, was reported
favorably today to the House from the
committee on appropriations. The bill
will be in charge of Representati ve
Jl> i ns of Tennessee, chairman of the
subcommittee which prepared the
measure.

It is necessary to read the entire report.
No great reductions in numbers
of employes are noted, except in cases
where the policy of reduction has been
known for some time past?notably the
pension bureau, where the force has
V been decreasing with the slacking up
of work. The lower-grade clerks of the

111.? Further gains for the Gorans
in the region north of the
rcnch fortress of Verdun were
ported by the Berlin war office
day. The statement says the
itire wooded district northwest
id northeast of Beaumont and
ic forest of llerbe arc in posrssion
of the Germans.
Announcement also was made
thetcapture by the Germans of
ic villages of Brabant, llaumont
id Samogneux, in the Verdun
gion. Samogneux is about one
ilc south of llauniont. the loss
which was admitted yesterday
y the French war office. It is ;
x miles north of Verdun. Loss ji
the village of Brabant is aditted
today.

Crown Prince's Ambition.
To take the fortress of Verdun is one 0
the chief ambitions with which the t
Tmanfcrown prince has been credit- t
The present effort under his com- *
and is on a scale that indicates the
ost determined effort yet of his
mies to break down the barriers with a
hich the French have protected their T
ronghold and set within striking disnce
of the fortress itself. t
At last accounts the battle was still

ich side have been extremely heavy. x
Over Twentv-Five-Mile Front.
The great battle raging along the
lentv-five-mile front from Etani to t
alincourt, north and east of Verdun, ^
being followed with the most innse
interest by the public. It dis>ses
effectively of the question
liether or not the Germans would
ake an early offensive. The battle
the first on a large scale since the
fensive in the Champagne in Septem?r,
and is believed to be the foreinner
of stirring and perhaps decisive
rents.
The principal fighting centers in the
>ugh and thickly wooded country beveen
Etain and Datnvillers. Here
one .100,000 of the German crown
ince's best infantry are trying to
rest from the French important roads
hich would enable them to make their
ay through to the Meuse. The battle
t yet is only beginning, but it is said
ready to have cost the assailants of
ie French heavy casualties.
Involve Advanced Lines.
The Germans have been making pupations
for a big stroke at Verdun so
>enly during the past month that the s
ench had every chance to get ready
r them. The attacks up to the present
ilv involve the advanced lines, which t
e at least two miles beyond the outer t
fenses of the fortress. G
Military opinion here is inclined to
iubt that the Germans will attempt to a
rry Verdun by storm. It Is pointed %
it that besides the formidable works of 1
e fortress it is further protected by a J
:l<i army under command of Gen. Humrt,
an exceptionally energetic officer. <1
ie prevailing view ih mai me Germans i
e feeling the strength of the defense!, s
id that the resistance they meet witrf c
ay discourage them from proceeding to t
y to take the citadel by force, even \
ith the help of their greatest guns.

The President himself took th
afety first exposition in the morni
onferences after noon.
No Hurry Calls Sent. 1
He did not hurriedly send for senators i
- representatives to confer with them j
r to make inquiry as to the truth of i
le sttaements that his attitude toward J
ermany has stirred serious opposition
ithin his own party.
From authoritative sources it was

inecd that Congress will do nothing of 1
le kind and that, after a few days to ,
>o1 off, democratic statesmen now inined
to differ with him will settle
)wn to support of him and his policies,
lould he ask support.
The administration realizes, it was ad- 1
itted today, that constituents of many
jngressmen are writing or asking,
Why should Americans be allowed to
avel on armed merchantmen anyway?"
id that this conveys the impression that \
le people generally take that view. But s
is felt in Jiigh quarters that when J
lese same congressmen face an actual
solution in Congress that surrenders i
le fundamental principle of an Ameri- (
in to travel on the high seas they will r
ike a different view. 1
Would End Sea Freedom. l
The President, it is claimed by his ?
osest friends, would feel that he j
ould neVer be entitled to the respect
! his country if he should yield to the '
ew that an American had no right
i the high seas in a vessel armed j
ilely for defensive purposes. He holds I
lat if he should issue a warning to 1
lem to keep off such vessels, then the f
gh seas would no longer be free and i
ould be owned, absolutely and out- f
ght. by the country possessing the L
reatest numner 01 sunmarines. If
ingress should pass a resolution of t
arning the efTect would be the same. r
he President, it was indicated today,
ould quickly veto any resolution of
lat kind. -]
The fundamental principle of interitional
law is the freedom of the 1

ewpoint. Unarmed merchantmen, unjr
the policy of Germany, to go into
feet March 1. would, it is feared, be
itirely helpless and defenseless; they
ould be held up, passengers and
ew hastily and unsafely shoved into
nail boats and the vessels torpedoed.
Lawful to Arm Vessels.
The right to arm these vessels, it is
)inted out by those who support the
resident's view, is unquestioned under
ternationai law. They are admittedly
med for defensive purposes alone. The
an equipment would not be necessary
at for the presence of submarines huntig
to destroy them. They are on their

OF OPINION".
r STAMPEDED
PARTY REVOLT
Will Not Go to
ing Americans
1 Vessels.
rhite House today that President
orts that democrats in Congress
smarine question out of his hands
Americans to keep off armed pasic
day rather easily, visiting the
ng and holding two non-political
is sufficient evidence of an intention to
destroy them, if possible. They are
armed to fight a submarine if~ they
should see on#1 first. Americans all over
the world must return to their homes
some time. Owing to the scarcity of
?oo*. 10 ? iic uinicuiiy or re-:
turning: to their own country is serious.
Americans in Africa, for instance,
would never get back to their native
land if I hey waited for an American
vessel. They are compelled to travel
dn British or other vessels, some of
which may be armed. If they were
prevented from doing: so by warning of
this government they would be marooned.
The same thing is true in
many other quarters of the world. As
between America and Great Britain
there are passenger vessels owned in
this country, .but the vessels of other
countries traveling between here and
Europe are mostly unarmed. Americans
who would suffer most are those
in far-away lands not touched by
American ships.
Jefferson's Ruling- Cited.
The argument was made today bv administration
supporters that President
Jefferson held that a farmer who carried
a pistol in war time for his pro- <
lection against bandits or robbers
;ould not in any sense be regarded as
l soldier. If he was shot down while
n pursuit of his vocation by armed 1
?oldiers of the enemy it would he mur- <
ler. It is held that the same point may i
je taken as to armed merchantmen. s
The President, it was declared today,
vill stand firm. He will not agree that
Germany has the right to sink armed 1
nerchantmen without warning, and he ,
maintains that international law gives
he right of arming to these vessels,
ind that law must stand until changed. *
[f any nation has the right to set
iside international laws whenever it
lesires to do so, he holds, there would
toon be no international law.
Kany Telegrams Uphold President. ,
A flood of telegrams began pouring 1
nto the White House today upholding 1
^resident Wilson in his position, being ?
he result of published stories that Con- 1
rress is wavering in its support of him. <
