ment and it was he who captured the
Turkish commander During the ad
vance of the Teutonic allies he under
took the defense of Nish with 3200
men and retreated only after his force
had been reduced to 200.
Review of War Situation.
The greatest German drive for Ver
dun is being pushed with tremendous
force. Tho Teutonic lines are being
steadily drawn nearer the fortress,
according to the Berlin war office,
which today announces the driving of
another wedge into the French line.
It claims a German advance through
the village of Haumont and the cap
lure of Samogneux, about six miles
from Verdun. The Germans have oc
cupied the wooded 'district north of
Beaumont, the woods of Herbe and
the village of Brabant.
The French war office, on the other
hand, announces that the French lines
have not been broken. It admits the
loss of the village of Brabant, which
is characterized as an advanced posi
tion, but says an attack on Samog
neux was repulsed.
Desperate Fighting Continues.
Along the 25-mile front on which
the German attack is being directed
the fighting has been of the most
desperate character. Apparently h.
has been particularly intensive near
t-i ..nf nnrk -f tVi i afrnnirnci nf
the French positions, but wave after
wave of German infantry rolling
against the defenses have failed to
dislodge the French. They have been
driven out of part of the wood of
Caures, but their linos are holding
further to the east In front of Ornes.
Tho French explain their retreat in
certain sectors by declaring it waa
to avoid useless losses. The with
drawals are declared to have been
effected in perfect order.
Emperor William, it Is reported, has
established headquarters opposite
Verdun and to be making daily
speeches to his troops.
The great battlo on the western
front where more than 250,000 Ger
mans under the German crown prince
arc assaulting the French lines along
a 25-mile front north of Verdun, is
tho outstanding feature in the cur-"
rent war news.
At last accounts tho battle was rag
ing with great fury, both sides keep
ing up a continuous artillery fire and
throwing masses of troops into the
fray. Losses on each slde( have been
extremely heavy.
In the fighting during the second
day of the great battle, the Germans
pushed their way at points two miles
Inside the former French lines, pene
Iraling as far as the village of Hau

tee investigating the nomination of
Louis D. Brandeis to tho suprome
court that Mr Brandeis was employed
by Collier's as attornoy In tho Ballin-ger-Plnchot
Investigation "to protect
interests and those of the public "
Austen G. Fox, attorney for those
opposing Mr. Brandeis, had told tho
committee that Mr. Brandeis appeared
as counsel for L. R. Glavls, a former
official of the land office, about whom
the charges against -former Secretary
Ballinger centered.
Mr. Sullivan said Norman Hapgood,
the editor of Collier's employed Mr.
Brandeis and that no attempt was
made to conceal the employment,
Mr. Fox asked the committee to sub
poena Charles E. Kelly, a New York
attorney who, he said, he had Informa
tion, had been attorney for Collier's
during the Balllnger-Pinchot contro
versy. Fox said he would show that
Mr. Brandeis stated to Kelly he did
not wish the fact of his employment
by Collier's to be disclosed.

New England merger case.
Mr. Catchlngs said Mr. Brandeis
sent to Sullivan and Cromwell a copy
of a letter to the Massachusetts legis

denied he had personally been em
ployed by Harriman tor any of his cor

STORY OF DISASTER
Four Letters Addressed to

London, Feb. 24, 11:40 a. m. A bot
tle has been picked up from the sea
containing last messages from the
commander of the Zeppelin L-19 which
was wrecked In the -North sea, and
addressed to the commander's par
ents, wife and little son. The last of
the message stated that the airship
had dropped and the crew was drown
ing, says, a Reuter dispatch from Cop
enhagen. The yacht Stella picked up the bot
tle containing the messages from Com
mander Uhle near Gothenburg. Four
letters wore found, two addressed to
the parents of the Zeppelin command
er and one each to his wife and child.
Letters Tell Sad Story.
The letters were written at succes
sive periods. The third states that
the airship was then 100 meters above
the water, that the motors had failed
to act and that all were expecting at
any moment to drop. The fourth let
ter states that the airship had drop
ped and tho crew was drowning.
Tho L-19 was wrecked in the North
sea shortly after the Zeppelin raid
over England on January 31. It Is

SENSATIONAL EXPLOIT
Directs Machine After Two

Milan. Feb. 24. Via Paris, 5:30 a.
ra. Details are now published of the
raid carried out on last Friday by an
Italian air squadron on Libach and it
is declared to have been eminently
successful, chiefly on account of tho
heroism of Captain Salomon who
piloted a large machine earring four
men. The task entrusted to the ma
chine was to engage adversary air
craft in order to allow tho other Ital
ian machines to accomplish their mis
sion of bombardment. Captain Salo
mone attacked several Austrian aero
planes and In tho battles which en
sued two of his companions were kill
ed and he himself wounded. He con
tinued, however, to handle his ma
chine so sucessfully that his observer,
Colonel Barblerl, was able to keep up
a steady machine gun fire on the Aus
trlans. Bullets Rain From All Sides.
Bullots rained on the Italian aero
plane from all sides and Colonel Bar
blerl was killed. Tho pilot remained
alone with the bodies of his compan
ions hindering the manipulation of
tho levers, that of Colonel Barblerl
lying across one of the steering wires.
Wiping the blood from his eyes, for
ho was wounded in the forehead, Cap
tain Salomone managed to move the
body and that of another man so that
he could steer more easily and, hav
ing sufficiently delayed tho pursuer;
to enable his fellow aviators to roach
their goal, he finally landed at Pal
manova and was taken from his ma
chine In a faltlng condition. King
Victor Emmanuel has awarded him
the modal for valor.
The Italian official communication
of February 19 said that the air raid
carried out on Libach on the preceding
day was In retaliation for numerous
violations of International law by the
Austrians and that the raiding squad
ron dropped several dozens of grenade
mines and bombs on the city. It add
ed that ono of the- Italian machines
had been forced to descend on Austri
an territory. The American official
statement, referring to tho same raid,
said "that it was a lamentable affair."

Impending Trouble Willi H
Germany Sends Wheat
Down Seven Cents.
Chicago, Feb. 24. Disturbing ru-
mors that drastic consequences would H
iesult from tension between Wash- H
Ington and Berlin regarding Ger- H
luany's submarine policy, caused a H
break of more than seven cents a H
bushel today in the price of wheat, as H
compared with values current earlier H
in the session. The gist of the ru- H
mors was that the handing of pass- H
ports to the German ambassador was H
imminent. H
The most sensational fall took M
place in the price of the May option, H
which dropped from $1.24 1-3 to 1.17, 1
a loss of seven and a quarter cents. H

For the greater part, the losses H
took place in the last fifteen minutes H
and were accompanied by wild efforts H
