It Always Helps
says Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., In
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, 1
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, I began to fed like a new woman, i soon
ga.ned 36 pounds, and now, 1 do all my housework,
as: well as run a big water mill
1 wish every suffering woman would give
Cardui
The Woman's Tonic
a inaL I still use Cardui when 1 feel a little bad,
and it always does tne good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are sure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need Cardui, the woman's
tonic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
for your trouble. It has been helping weak, ailing
women for more than fifty years.
