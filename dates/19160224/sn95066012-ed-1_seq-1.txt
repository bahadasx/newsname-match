MANY GOOD VOICES PRESENT
Local Knights Have Established Pre
cedent For Minstrel 'Entertain
ment In Bennington.
Those who expected to take the fur
niture at the Harte Theater to pieces
for chair-legs to protest against the
quality of the K. of C. minstrels last
evening, were agreeably surprised to
be suddenly handed their money's
worth and incidentally saturated with
one of the best minstrel entertain
ments offered by home talent in
the village for several winters. Music
that least disagreeable of all
noise3 was in abundance, and sever
al cracked a Joke. Dut otherwise the
performance was bright, breezy, belli
cose and bustling.
The show was prompt in starting,
snappy in delivery and when it came
to an end, it stopped! The start oc
curred about 8.15 while some of those
standing in the rear waiting for ush
ers still had a long neck. But the or
chestra, composed of Harold R. Hur
ley, violin; Daniel Rifenburg, cello;
It. D. Long, bass viol; Harold Cook,
clarinet; Murray Hamilton, cornet;
A. D. Hurley, trombone; Edward Hur
ley, drums and Miss Helen Hurley at
the piano satiated the place with first
class melody for a spell, and other
wise kept indiscretion at a minimum
and director E. C. Bennett got on his
rostrum on schedule ' and began to
make with his hands motions.-
The leadership of Judge Bennett de
serves a whole paragraph,. Jhg musi
cal judge found a -chair-rung round
the place, with which' he 'proceeded to
slash up the atmosphere in a scandal
ous manner,' followed by the orches
tra in such perfect time that it was
well worth the price of admission to
watch his perfect control over his
thoroughly eflloient salon of harmony
artists and wonder how they did it.
When It comes to. leading an orches
tra, Judge Bennett knows his job and
he lost no fragments of his reputa
tion in that quarter, keeping the per
formance up to the chalk-line in first
class shape.
After the overture, the curtain
arose on an imposing assemblage of
fair women and brave men; the fair
women being In the auditorium and
the brave men behind the footlights.
A tier of male singers in white shirts
rose behind a half-circle of similar
sex and species in dress-suits below,
with William J. Lunergan as interlo
cutor in the center, rearing a smile
that wouldn't come off. Subsequently
on the ends, appeared apparitions In
canvas pajamas, silk sashes and soot
from their kitchen stoves, who pro
ceeded to instigate a musical distur
bance without further incentive.
When behaving themselves ' in the
even tenor of their way th'ey are
known as John J Whitney, Joseph J.
McDermott, Marden H. Nichols, II.
Harry Sfharpe, Gidlon LaCrosse, Ed
ward M. Whitney, Martin Cutler Pat
rick. Dunn and David P. Sears. The
larker side, of Collins (M'Lord)
Graves was also present, but of him,
more later.
The doings commenced with a
minstrel overture played by Judge
Bennett's baton and accompanied by
a lusty chorus of the fifty-odd male
voices and consisting of all the re
cent songs on the Chautauqua circuit,
several popular hits and a few picked
up by somebody on a Saturday night
visit to Hoosick Falls. The choruses
and songs for the entire performance
were arranged for the occasion by
Fred Thebarge, who has praise
worthy talent in this direction and

showed his genius in last evening's
program.
.Joseph A. Pellerln was the first
man to use the footlights. His song
"Moon Beams Bring Love Dreams
brought out the first encore. Joseph
J. McDermott, who is a wary wizard
on his feet then started something
with "When Old Bill Bailey Plays the
Ukalele." In the second verse he got
the song tangled up with the name of
Bennington's popular and patient-
souled dentist, Dr. F. S. Braley, and
began to unreel a startling series of
misadventures encountered by the
"Doc" and Atty. Robert Healy "In
foreign parts."
William Shaw then rendered that
classical solo, "A Son of the Desert
Am I," and he received an encore
likewise, not because the audience
was polite, but because not a number
found its way onto the program and
subsequently into the atmosphere
which was not well worth hearing
over again. '.-..,,.
Gedlon LaCrosse described the
"Alabama Jubilee" with anatomical
gyrations and when Michael Gilmore
and quartette sang "My Old Home
Town in Ireland" one could believe
there were three or four Irishmen in
the house judging from the continued
and tumultuous applause by which
they were again and again called to
repeat the last verses.
It was somewhere about this time
that the stage door opened and a
strong wind blowing up Main street
wafted into the Cardial Edifice some
thing dressed in pale terror, a pair of
black eyes that covered his whole
facea suit of clothes that Harry Van
derburg usually wears while maintain
ing sanitation in Main street build
ings, kindly loaned for the occasion,
and a scarlet stomacher made from
all the red stripes in the national flag,
cut out and sewed together.' A derby
hat, held on by a few hairs on the top
or the usual location was also present,
aud when the misdemeanor opened
its face to sing "They All Had a Fin
ger In the Pie." theaudience knew In
stinctively that Collins M. Graves was
somewhere about,' but horribly muti
lated with mural decorations and a
propensity to furnish humor for the
occasion. Along about the third verse
the singer got off the track and pick
ed it up again on the man-trail of
Bennington's selectmen, several local
doctors and others who would not
bring- suit, for damages. . Mr.' Graves
delivered himself of, the yerses on his
chest,' with . neatness, clearness and
dispatch, ' after which lie sat down
iwhere he could , te plainly seen ,wlth
the naked eye. . The performance con
tinued. ' ;';
'Herbert W. Small, who has already
won local laurels for his, ,,fine. , bass
voice, brought the audience back to
serious things with a rendition of
''The Deathless Army." It was by
far ,the best thing in bass
delivered from a ' Bennington plat
form in many seasons. Small got ex
ceptional attention from the orchestra
and a combination of the two put an
other feather in Small's hat which has
already begun to take on the aspect
of a Sioux war bonnet.
John J. Whitney then sang "Rag
apation" during which he had hard
work to keep bis feet still and finally
gave it up; and Roy Clum ended the
individual features with "Whispering
Breezes," that permitted some of his
famous yodle work, already well-ap
predated by Bennington audiences.
The finale was "Oh tlie Road' to Old
Klllarney," n vocal conspiracy by the
entire company.- 1
In the olio a quartette by Michael
Gilmore, v Ralph Sherwin, George
Small and Herbert Small sang "Aunt
ie Skinner's Chicken Dinner" with en
cores of southern songs; Joseph. Mc
Dermott appeared in a pleasing single
"Along the Rocky Road to Dublin"
and Edward J. Cummings and Joseph
McDermott,, Patrick Dunn and Frank
.McCarty took the boards in male
and female' costume as Irish dancers.
Some genuine Irish jigs were present
ed and the audience would have kept
them dancing yet had not George
Small stolen a Harry Lauder rig-out
and. broken loose upon the stage.
After a couple of clever Scotch songs
the Whitney Brothers dared the spot
light with fantastic toe work, and the
whole brought up with 16 men lining
up in the uniforms of the warring
nations of Europe. Instead of level
ing each other with gas-brimbs al
though -such may have been filled
with nothing worse than ' Bennington
hot-air -they joined , in a chorus
with Marden Nichols in the rig-out of
Uncle Sam. During this number
William McGurn got dodging the
scenery in a Ford automobile christ
ened "Oscar II," and ran perilously
near the footlights for the purpose of
singing "Neutrality. Rag." For the
first time In several yoars a Ford
got stuck after a heavy round of "ap
plause and refused to work but sev
eral hard pushes from the spot-light
at last shoved it back so that the cur
tain could fall.
The Knights of Columbus furnish
ed an excellent entertainment. Their
local hits were good and they have
established a precedent for them
selves which may cost them hard
work to outdo if the show becomes
an annual feature.

AND MILITARISiV.
SAYS piIH
One Will End With Death of the
Other, Premier Declares o
BRITIAN'S TERMS DEFIN'D
Sword Will Not Be Sheathed Until
Belgium and Serbia Have Been
Avenged.
London, Feb. 24 Philip Snowden,
socialist member for Blackburn, took
advantage of the discussion of the
government's consolidated fund bill
in the House of Commons, yesterday,,
to raise the question of conditions un
der which, it would bo possible to
bring the war to an end with the ob
ject for which the allies were fighting
realized.
Both Mr. Snowden and Charles
Philips Trevelyan, liberal member
for Yorks, who followed along similar
lines, were listened to in silence, but
when Premier Asqulth replied his
speech was punctuated with loud out
bursts of cheers. "There is absolute
unity in the country" said the pre
mier. He declared that Mr. Snow
den's statement on the military situ
ation was a matter of opinion. "It is
not mine," was his comment.
Mr. Asqulth concluded aa follows,
his words evoking applause from
every coiner of the. House: "I have
stated in clear, direct, explicit and
emphatic language , what are tho
terms upon which we iu this country
are prepared to make peace. I will
repeat them. They are familiar to
our allies and well known to the Ger
man chancellor . What I said Novem
ber 9, 1914, I repeat now: "We shall
neve? sheathe the sword . 'we have
not lightly drawn until Belgium and
I will add, Servuv recover : in full

have sacrificed; i until France is ade
quately ; secured .against i aggression;
until the rights of. the small nations
of Europe are based iupon -. an- unas
sailable foundation and until the mill
tary domination of;Prussia 1b wholly
and finally destroyed' u '.'n: :
"What is there wanting in clear
ness and directness in that? I ask
Mr. Trevelyan and the German chan
cellor how I can make it fuller and
more Intelligible. How can I do
more to convince him and all our
enemies that not until a peace based
upon these foundations is within
sight of attainment shall we or any
of our allies abate by one jot our
prosecution of this war?"

HOW TO GET BID OF
CHRONIC DANDRUFF
, The only sure' way to get perma
nently rid of dandruff is to remove the
conditions that cuase it and then
keep the hair and scalp in a : clean,
healthy; vigorous state eo dandruff
will never return. This beats sham
poos, which merely remove the dand
ruff for a few days at most. W. L.
Gokay is now strongly recommending
Parisian Sage, a harmless, in expen
sive and quick acting preparation,
that is guarauteed to act directly on
the cause of dandruff and entirely re
movo it orthe purchase price will be
cheerfully refunded.
Here is a test no one should fail to
try. Get from your druggist a pack
age of Parisian Sage Rub a little of
it into the scalp with the finger tips
and see for yourself how the dandruff
disappears, the hair stops falling out
and all itching immediately ceases.
Nothing hurt3 the hair more ' than
dandruff, so why not begin uselng Pa
risian Sage today and be forever rid
of it? . ...

Local Organizations to Appeal
for
Funds Saturday.
Saturday, February 2Cth, has-been
set aside by the Young Men's Chris

On this day the boys, themselves,
will appeal for funds for tho support

Jn Bennington, the Y. M. C. A. Jun
ior boys plan to see every person in

no set minimum.
The work of the Y. M. C. A. for the
Juniors in Bennington is headed up
in the Junior Boys' Club, which in
cludes all Junior members. Monday

tho conduct of their game rooms,
with some member on duty. He keeps
the lights down, curtains even, waste
paper off the floor, collects dues, etc.
On Saturday the gymnasium class is
repeated.
It is toward the maintenance of

Germans Have Captured two Villages
and Are Training Big Guns
Against Defences.
London, Feb. 24. The British
steamer Westburn, brought into the
Canary Islands port of Santa Cruz
yesterday by a prize crew from the
German commerce raider . Meewe,
was today run out to sea by the crew
and sunk, according to dispatches re
ceived here today from Madrid. Af
ter sinking the Westburn, the Ger-
! man sailors escaped in boats.,
j The action of the prize crew was
I taken, it is believed, because of intl-
mation frcm the Spanish government
that the steamer would be returned
to her owners if she was interned.
London, Feb. 24. Under the eye of
the Kaiser the great offensive move
ment of the Germans north of Verdun

ly six miles from the apparent objec
tive point of the attack. The losses
of both armies is estimated at 50,000.
Lii; guns are being hurried forward,
by ths Germans to batter the de
fences of. Verdun but the French war
office declares that the forts are too
strong to be reduced.
