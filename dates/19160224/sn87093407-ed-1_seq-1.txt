BREED!NG GRAFT AMD GRAFT ERSE
<f Hi Gill is Hi Gill! When Hi Gill is in control, gamblers, white slavers, plain grafters—in and out of the
police department—feel themselves, whether rightly or wrongly, under a benevolent protection. As long as
Gill is mayor, just so long will there exist an unhealthy atmosphere that engenders license and graft.
C Since Austin E. Griffiths resigned as chief, Seattle has had a Lang scandal, a police officer convicted of grafting from unfortunate women, and Felix Crane, negro
boss of the underworld, sent to the penitentiary for levying tribute upon the women "below the line" for "protection."
« EVERY DOLLAR FELIX CRANE'S ORGANIZATION COLLECTED FROM THESE WOMEN WAS SPLIT WITH SOMEBODY HIGHER UP. THAT IS
AN OPEN SECRET, THO CRANE WENT TO PRISON RATHER THAN TELL WHO IT WAS.
(} There is the underworld district itself —an institution brought on anew with Gill in office. There are rows upon rows of houses within a few square blocks in
the district between Sixth and Eighth aves. S. and King and Dearborn sts., where women ply their illicit trade, right under the noses of the police, openly and
securely.
Gambling has flourished openly. AND NOW, in spite of Hi Gill's recent pulpit mouthings on the grand old prohibition law, the police, with their incompetent
chief, are winking at the sale of booze. Any one who wants a drink knows where he can get it. The police know, too.
Clt is not safe for Seattle to take another chance with Hi Gill. The suppression of grafters, more numerous than ever, with bootlegging privileges, is not a Hi Gill
job. Nor a Louie Lang job. IT NEEDS A STALWART, VIRILE, SQUARE, INTELLIGENT CITIZEN LIKE AUSTIN E. GRIFFITHS!
