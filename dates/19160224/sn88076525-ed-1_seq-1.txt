UNITED STATES WILL SOON
BE ENGAGED IN WAR
FOR EXISTANCE.
Chicago, Feb. 22.—Major General
Leonard Wood, in an address at the
annual dinner of the Harvard club last
night predicted that within a few
years the United States will be .en
gaged in a .war for existance and de
picted the nation as a cripple, leaning
on the crutches of the malitia volun
teer system. He said the malitia is
ineffective and in its present form
would be practically useless for field
aervice. He spoke encouragingly, how
ever, of the activities of college men in
acquiring military training.
"It's just'as good as the administra
tion has let# be," General Wood said
in discussing the national guard. "The
inefficiency of the national guard is
not due to its officers and men. It is
-due to the system under which it is
operated. It has too many bosses. If
the army had 48 bosses as the national
guard has in the 48 governors it would
be just as inefficient as the national
guard."
Omer Herzog, one of the prosper
ous young farmers of Overland town
ship, was in the city Friday. He has
been visiting at the home of his uncle,
.Herman Herzog of Grand Harbor
township. '"'W

WRECK
OK HEWN
Milford, Conn., Feb. 22.—At least
ten were killed and 50 injured when
the Connecticut River Special from
Springfield, Mass., for New York on
the New Haven railroad, was run into
by a special passenger train. The lat
ter train was made up in New Haven
to carry passengers who otherwise
would have gone on the regular ex
press from Boston to New York.
Among the dead is the flagman of
the Connecticut River train, who had
gone back to protect his train, which
had been stopped by a broken air-pipe.
It is said the flagman lost his life in a
futile attempt to stop the special, run
ning up the track so close to the en
gine of the oncoming train that he
could not escape. His body was cut
to pieces.
Thee roar end collision occurred a
moment later. At the time of the
collision, a freight train was running
west parallel with the passenger train
on the next track. When the smash
came a passenger coach was jammed
over against the freight train. The
boiler of the engine of the special ex
ploded, throwing wreckage in all di
rections. This engine was then hurl
ed down an embankment carrying two
coaches. These rolled over and over
before touching the bottom. Wreck
age was piled high all about.

A SUCCESS
Probably one of the most interest
ing events of the season was the an
nual ball of the city firemen held at
the Roller rink on Tuesday evening.
It seems that nearly everybody had a
tendency to "wait for the firemen's
ball" which has surely become one of
the many get-together affairs, judg
ing from the three hundred or more
who were there. Dancing began
promptly on time and the excellent
music furnished by the orchestra cer
tainly did put life into the crowd
which fairly packed the rink to suf
focation.
Seldom has such an immense gather
ing assembled where all seemed to be
out for a good time—and got it—and
at the close unanimously voted the
"Smoke-eaters annual" the best ever.

DECLARES LINCOLN CANT
BE TRIED AS A SPY.
New York, Feb. 22.—Charles Fox,
counsel to the British consulate gen
eral here, asserted today that Ignatius
T. T. Lincoln, who calls himself an in
ternational spy, cannot be put on trial
as a spy in England if he is extradited
to that country.
Itr.
Fox said that
there is no ground for Lincoln's de
claration that if he is sent to England
to answer to a charge of forgery he
cannot be executed there as a spy.
The lawyer said that under the treaty
of 1889 between Great Britain and the
United States no citizen of either
country could be put on trial for any
other than the offense for which he
was extxadicted.
Mr. Fox has notified Lincoln's cotihsel
that he will make a motion befort the
United States Supreme court in Wash
ington, March 25, to advance the hear
ing of argument on Lincoln's extra
dition:
Lincoln was captured Saturday af
ter a sensational escape from the cus
tody of a United States deputy mar
shal about a month ago,

^UME XXXIII. NUMBER 3
UNDER EIRE
FLYERS SENT TO DEATH IN OLD
RICKETY MACHINES, SENATOR
CHARGES.
Washington, Feb. 22.—"Several U.
S. Army aviators have been sent to
their deaths in deficient aeroplanes,
despite protests to their superiors."
This, in effect, is the charge made
by Senator Robinson of Arkansas who
has introduced a resolution in Con
gress providing for a Senatorial inves.
tigation of the army air corps.
Members of the military affairs com.
mittee are said to be unanimously in
favor of the investigation and Sena
tor Robinson says he will lay all his
information before the investigators.
Protests Unheeded.
In one case which will be brought
to the attention of the investigators
the senator said, the officer was warn
ed that if the machine went up in the
air, it was likely to collapse.
"We'll see about that," the com
manding officer replied. Senate?
Robinson charges. "The man was sent
up the machine crumpled up and the
flyer fell to his death."
Other charges which Robinson will
bring out are:
That after seven years of organiza
tion the army has not yet got one sin
gle squadron of men able to fly.
Civilian Flyers Used.
That when he visited the San
Diego training school last summer
they had to send him aloft with a
civilian flyer, because there was no
one connected with the army who was
competent.
RECEIPT OE FUND
The fund which was recently raised
in this city for the relief of the Jewish
War sufferers was duly, forwarded to
the proper head and the following let
ter recently received by Abe Calof
shows that the money was duly re
received.
New York, February 11, 1916,—Mr.
A. Calof, Manager, Devils Lake Cen
tral Relief Committee, Devils Lake,
N. D.
Dear Sir:
I acknowledge receipt with many
thanks your favor of the 4th enclos
ing $257.35 for which you w'll please
find our receipt No. 26852. I think
the showing you have made for a
tvwn your size is splendid indeed, and
feel that it is but right that you'
should convey, the thanks of Ihis com
mittee to thepeople of-your city for
the assistance they rendered on Pres
ident's Proclamation Day, through
the medium of your local press.
Apart from money obtained, thfc
response has vouchsafed that feeling
of gratificatinon which humanity can
only enjoy when it put to the test of
proving the common brotherhood of
man. The PresiJent of the United
States in naming Jewish Pro Uaraation
Day, surely had the ethical idea in
mind as well as he did the practical
assistance that he knew would he
forthcoming from 1he people of Amer
ica.
I beg to call your attention to the
enclosure dealing vith the question of
forwarding of medicines to Palestine,
which we would like to have you pub
lish in your paper likewise.
Yours very truly,
Harry ^ischel,
Treasurer.
It is rumored that friends of A. M.
Powell are urging him to become a
candidate for the office of county
treasurer, and while he has made no
formal announcement yet, there is a
possibility that he will toss his hat
into the ring.
