It will not be long before the
primary election for delegates to
the national contentions will take
place, and this will be next month.
The boom for the nomination of
Col. Roosevelt by the Republican
convention cannot be stopped as it
now appears to the public, and the
next campaign will no doubt be
between him and President Wil
son.
The Lawler and Lynch factions
of the Minnesota Democracy are
still as far apart as ever. The
Democratic party in this state will
not have any chance whatever to
win and this is the fault of the
national administration as much as
the fault of the warring local fac
tions.
The Chippewas of Minnesota
stand steadfastly by Sen. Clapp,
and if their expressions is any in
dication they will cast a solid vote
for hira.

Clapp has not,yetfi^4^*
a re-nomination to fill the position
in the United States senate he now
holds, but no one need for a mom

the time comes, and his friends
need not have any doubts about
this. $185,000 Will Be
propriated Of Chippewa
Tribal Funds,
ID view of the passage by the
House of Representatives at Wash
ington of $185,000 from Chippe
wa tribal iuuds, the delegations
now at Washington from this and
other Chippewa reservations are
trying to secure amendments to
the item which will confine the In
dian office to $60,000 for the pay
of employees upon all the reserva
tions in Minnesota, except labor
ers
lage.
The delegates also want^ an
amendment to the Indian bill
which will confine theO'Neil force
st Cass Lake to not to exceed #55.
000 for the payment of his force
and its expenses, and that all funds
hereafter expended from the Chip
pewa fund shall be reported an
nually in a detailed statement to
Congress.
The Chippewa tribal and indiv
idual funds have been most scan
dalously wasted and hereafter the
Cnippewas will continue to make
.efforts to have a full, complete de
tailed accounting made to them as
provided by the act of 1889.

A MISUNDERSTANDING
SOMEWHERE,
The Congressional Record of
February 4th contains the follow
ing discussion which took place on
the floor of the House of Repre
sentatives at Washington, relative
to the Chippewa items on the In
dian bill now pending in Con
gress
"The clerk read as follows:
'The Secretary of the Interior is
hereby authorized to withdraw
from the Treasury of the United
States, at his discretion, the sum
of $185,000, or as much thereof as
may be necessary, of the principal
on deposit to the credit of the
Chippewa Indians in the State of
Minnesota, arising under section
7 of the act of January 14, 1889,
entitled 'An act for the relief and
civilization of the Chippewa In
dians in the State of Minnesota,'
and to use the same for the pur
pose of promoting civilization and
self-support among the said In
dians in manner and for purposes
provided for in naid act.'
Mr. Miller of Minnesota. Mr.
Chairman I move to strike out the
figures '185,000' and insert in
lieu thereof the figures '$100,000.'
The Chairman. The Clerk will
report the amendment.

iliJ,
tmintio to fill the position [Chairman, in support of this offer.
ed amendment I would like to have
the attention of the committee
while I present certain facts which
I think are worthy of serious con
sideration. TheJLndians in Minne
sota are paying their ^w bills.
At no time within a great many
years have any gratuities been ex
tended by the United States to
of Minnesota. The
treaty which was made between
the United States" and the Chippe
wa Bands, assembled into one,
acting as a unit, in 1889 provided
that thereafter the property of the
Indians should be placed in the
hands of the United States, a part
to be distributed for certain pur
poses and at a certain time and a
part to be distributed at the dis
eretion of the Secretary of the In
terior from time to time, not ex
ceeding a certain amount, and the
residue to be distributed among
the people living and members of
the tribe at the end of fifty year?.
The justification of this paragraph
The delegations are also making found in that part of the treaty
hicb says that Congress
an effort to have the bill provide
that members of the Chippewa
bands of Minnesota shall receive
the preference as employees in the
Chippewa It.dian service.
Another amendment that the
delegations are working for is that
not Teas than $25,000 shall be u*ed
to furnish employment for the In
dians in building roads upon the
Chippewa reservations, and al*o
$10,000 for an electric light plant
for White Earth Agency and vil
ApChippewas
can a
propiiate from time to time sums
of money uot exceeding 5 per cent
of the annual income on the trust
fund held by the Unitpd States be
longing to these Indians, such
sums to be turned over to the Sec
retary of the Interior, by him to
be expended for the support and
civilization of the Indians. Under
that large sums of money have
been spent in the past. It seems,
that every year there has been an
increase in the expenses connected
with this administration, notwith
standing the fact that every year
has shown a decrease in the num
ber of Indians actually to be sup
eru&ed and a large increase in the
number of Indians who have be
come self supporting and register
ed among the competents. I
seems easy to add an official, to
begin an expense, but mighty
difficult ever to stop or to cut it
off. I was extremely surprised to
find what it is costing to spend the
money of the Indians of Minne
sota.
For four year? I have been try
ing to get a detailed statement
ly*s,f"^r^F
rp* i, i jfti
from the Indian Office showing the
items that come out of this ap
propriation annually made, but by
reason of lack of clerical assistance
or by reason of bookkeeping not
being such as to make the figures
easily ascertainable I have never
yet been able to get that detailed
account, although they have sup
plied me with certain lump sums
or general subjects of appropria
tions so that we may know what
the general sums and general pur
poses are which are cared for out
of these funds. I find from the
letter of the Secretary of the In
terior transmitted December 6
last, the year just closed, there
were expended for the support
and civilization of the Indians of
Minnesota out of their own funds
$274,000. If you gentlemen will
recall, last year the bill carried
not only this $185,000 but an ad
ditional appropriation of $25,000
for a hospital and some other mi
nor appropriations I think there
was also one of $40,000 with which
to purchase land for the Mille Lac
Lake Indians. Now do you know
what it cost
The Chairman Is there objec
tion?
There was no objection.
Mr. Miller of Minnesota. That
question has been in my mind ever
since I have considered the advis
ability of making this motion.
And I am frank to say I do not
know. I have been requested to
make the reduction very much
greater than I have made it by
this motion. I thought it would
{ptgeitotocft to -redacr^ir-feelDw
$100*000. I am not certain but
that to reduce it by $85,000 at one
blow might work some disadvant
age, and I certainly do not want
to cripple any needed work for
these Indians. Some of the work
I know is splendid. I do not want
to be captious about it, but I do
not know. It seems to me that if
the sum is reduced to $100,000,
and there is reasonable attention
given to the necessities of the sit
uation, no great harm will result.
I was about to make a further in
quiry. What is the condition of
these Indians whose money is thus
being expended year after year?
I find from the hearings the state
ment of the Assistant Indian Com
missioner, Mr. Meritt, that there
are practically 11,200 Indians in
Minnesota subject to the jurisdic
tion of the Government. In these
11,000, however, 6,000 are unallot
ted. That means 6,000 Indians
no longer having tribal relations,
or who are children bornfcincethe
date when the allotments were
made, and, of course, small child
ren. There are only 2,000 of them
having trust patents. Three thous
and five hundred of them have
been adjudged competents by the
Indian Office itself, and patents
in fee have hitherto been issued to
them. However, we must modify
that by the further statement that
some of these patents in fee were
secured under the so-called Clapp
Act and some of them are now in
volved in litigation, it being
claimed they were issued to full
bloods and therefore presumably
to incompetentjlndians. Especial
ly the commissioner before the In
dian Committee, I am informed,
and the chairman will correct me
if I mistake the facts, as I was not
there and cannot state them of my
own knowledge. The Indian Com
missioner or his assistant before
the Indian Committee a few days
ago said that at least 60 or 70 )e
cent of the Indians in Minnesota
are perfectly competent to manage
their own affairs.
Therefore, it seems to me, it ia
very safe to say that of the 11,000
Indians who are subject to the
jurisdiction of the Federal Govern-

ment, not more than 4,000 or
5,000 at the outside need the care
of the United States Government
in any degree. Personally I think
the number is not over 2,500. If
2,500, it is costing them about $100
apiece each year to have the Gov
ernment manage their affairs for
them. It is costing these men who
are competent, under any consid
eration or aspect of the case, al
most as much to have their busi
ness done for them as the value of
the business is when it is done.
Now, to cite some illustrations,
I made some statements before the
Committee on Indiau Affairs the
other day to the effect that I had
learned to my infinite surprise
that at the White Earth Indian
Reservation alone there weie six
Indian farmers, and I venture to
say that of the six there was not
ane who could make his living on
a piece of land in the woods if he
were left there. There is no use
for six. Nobody contends that
there is use for the six. I under
stand that since that time five of
them have been taken awaythat
is, in the last 10 days. I am also
advised that certain other em
ployees of that agency who cer
tainly were supernumerary have
been taken away. I do not know
how many ought to be taken away
from the service, but I do know
that there are too many of them
there now.
I do not want to cripple the ser
vice. I do not want to *tfleany
of the good work that has been
done, or ought to be done but I
do not like to see the substance of
these Indians, the property that
they have in the hands of the Gov
ernment, over which they are

helpless to exercise any control,
year by year frittered away and
wasted in salaries of unnecessary
employees. Consequently, I place
these facts before the committee
that they may receive cousidera
tion. If not now, sorue day soon
something should be done.
The Chairman. The gentleman
from Minnesota (Mr. Ellsworth) is
recognized.
Mr. Ellsworth. Mr. Chairman
and gentlemen of the committee,
being from the State of Minnesota,
where these Chippewa Indians are
situated, and a member of the
Committee on Indian Affairs, I
feel that it is my duty when an
amendment of this kind is pending
in the House, in the consideration
of the measure in the Committee
of the Whole, to say something
about it.
I sat through the hearings of
the committee, and I heard all that
was said in the hearings before the
Committee on Indian Affairs in
reference to the $185,000 item of
the Chippewas, coming from their
fund and I want to say now not
only as to this amendment but, so
far as my service in this House is
concerned, I hope-at any time I
shall not rise to strike out the last
word or ask for time on the floor
of this House for the purpose of
making a speech. I have no speech
to make upon this question, but I
want to nay a few things in refer
ence to it, because I feel, coining
as I do from this State and having
a membership on this committee,
that it would not be proper for me
to remain silent and refflse to
speak on an amendment which, I
want to say at this time, I do not
favor. I do not favor it because

No. 44.
this committee, I believe, is a fair
minded committee It hab stood
ready to reduce the amount to be
taken from the Chippewa Indians'
fund in Minnesota upon proof
submitted to it of a tangible nature
of the fact that the money has
been squandered.
There were a great many things
said before the committee of a sort
of ethereal type about the money
b'ing squandered in different
ways. There was a great deal of
time spent before the committee
upon these items, but when it was
finally simmered down to the las
analysis it amounted to thisthat
one man who said he was an at
torney, and appeared for the Chip
pewas, charged that there was a
superintendent hired in one of the
schoolswhich was one of the
several dozen or scores of hems
making up the amountwho drew
$1,000 salary, and he did not know
hut that thai, superintendent's ser
vices could be dispensed with.
Thereupon I called this football
player of Carlisle and Minnesota,
concerning whom my colleague
has made such an eloquent spepch,
and asked him if he wanted to
have this item of $1,000 stricken
out, and he said he would talk
with his colleagues on the reser
vation about it and after doing so
he did not know whether they
wanted to do that or not. Deduct
ing the tangible part of that sum
of $185,000 that this man wanted
stricken out, would leave $184,000,
and they were not sure that they
wanted that stricken.
I am for anything tangible that
is submitted to the committee. I
