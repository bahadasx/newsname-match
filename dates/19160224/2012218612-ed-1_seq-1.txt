ERiHQAKE SHOU FELT
IN WINSBORO
Said to Have Been the Heaviest
Since the Shock of 1886.
Covered Several States.
A distinct earthquake shock
was felt here on Monday evening
about 6:30. Dishes rattled and
a fairly heavy tremor was .felt
all over buildings. This is thought
by many tohave been the heaviest
shock. since the noted earthquake
of August 31. 1886, when oc
curred what is known as the
Charleston earthquake. The
shock seems to have been gen
eral over several States but so
far no damage has been report
ed. Thei following dispatch tells
of it at other places:
Atlanta, Ga., Feb. 21. --An
earth tremcr of slight but dis
tinct nature that made itself felt
throughout Georgia, North and
South Carolina, Virginia and por
tions of Eastern Tennessee and
Alabama as reported early to
night as having 'b.een felt at
about 5'45 p. m., Central time to
day. In no case was any damage
reported and while in some in
stances persons hurriedly left
buildings there was nothing in
the nature of a panic. The only
seismograph known to be in the
section affected by the tremor is
at Mobile, Ala., where the in
strument recorded brief shocks.
Most reports agreed that the
tremor passed from east to west
and was felt only momentarily.
In. Augusta; Ga., and several
other places, however, three dis
_,tinct shocks were reported. At
other points onl3 one tremor. was
felt
The earth shock either did not
reach Florida or was so slight as
not to be felt there, according to
reports here tonight.

Let Us Celebrate the Occasion
Tn about one month or less
time the public improvements
will be in operation in Winns
boro and we should Noiid some
kind of public function to cele
brate the occasion. We believe
that this will mark a new era for
Winnsboro's industrial life and
we should not let it be quietly
ushered in without some kind of
demonstration. When c.mpleted
wve will have a complete system
of water works and sewerage and
also a twenty-four hour a day
electric current. This is also
something to be proud of and
worth letting the outside world
know.

Being a resident of Columbia when

rould return# to Virginia, believing
hat his native state would. not leave

Torfolk. However, the people of V1r
Inia were not to be free from the
ssue which was about to throw the

He was wounded at Gettysburg and
also In a charge near Knoxville. The

through, is in his possession.
At Knoxville, in 1863, he was cap
tured and taken to Rock Island, Ill.,
and kept prisoner for 17 months. Jno.
A. Stewart of Fairfield county was at
the same time a p isoner thsre, but
this fact was not known to Mr. White
till he afterwards lived in Winnsboro.
The prison fare was very good at
first and those prisoners. having
money were alMowed to buy of the,
sutler'es. But later as a retaliatory
measure this was stopped.
Prison Fare-Rats!
Mr. White told me at his residence
in EamClafre Just a short while since
that he ate mice and rats, that the
men were starving. He said: "I ate
the hind leg of a big fat rat while in
prison in Rock Island, In., and was

TAKE TIHE RISI
An Effort Will Be Made to
Prevent Americans on
AiiAried S,,
9 of the Charlotte Observer:
a In the House today a move
s ment was under way quietl:
a among leaders to have consider
I ation given to some form of legis
I lation that would prevent Ameri
can citizens"from taking passap
on armed merchant vessels. Thi
a plan to be advanced has beei
9 formulated definitely, numero=
r bills introduced looking to a pro
hibition that could be readily en
t forced by the Federal authori
ties.
This movement~ is being mad<
as a result, it is said, of the pro
,posed plan of submarine warfare
Jto be conducted by Germany aftei
1 the 29th of February on armet
7 merchant vessels. House leaders
-and members of both parties
generally regard the impending
situation as one of the ugliest the
country has faced, and the pro
posed legislation is looked upot
by those who urge it as one o:
the best nmethods that can b
employed to keep this country ai
peace.
That any legislation of this na
tune rwould be opposed by the
Administration is expected in
view of the stand that has beer>
taken for the rights of Americans.
It is quite likely that if the
movement comes to surface, it
will mean one of the strongest
fights that has vet occurred in~
the House, provided the present
supporters of the contentions of
the Administration-that Ameri
cans have a right to protection,
and that ; certain vessels have
a right to arm for defensive pur
poses-choose to stand with the
Administration.
In view of declarations from~
Germany- to the effect that mer
chant vessels in arming them
selves can be doing so only for
offensive purposes, because the
time has passed when pirates
roam the seas, the supporters of
Ithe movement to control and pre
vent American passage feel that
'the Nation must pass the legis
lation they desire for the sake of
safety from war.
Washington is watching the
developments of the foreign situ
ation anxiously. The German plan
of submarine warfare occupied
the most careful attention in the
cloak-rooms, and members of
Congress are discussing the ques
tion i n .guarded language.
House leaders view the situation
as one of the most serious that
has engaged public attention
since the controversies arose
A very successful minstrel was
Igiven in the Cornwell school by

Legislative Session
ful of strucive :s
Columbia," Feb. 2 'he e
cent session- of the Lcgislature
T was one of marked enthusiasm
and enterprise. Nearly 400 acts
were satified.
Close to the head of the list
stand the McCullough child labor
2 bill, raising the age limit for the
employment of children in fac
tories, mines-or textile plants
from 12 to 14 years. This is to
become effective January 1, 1917.
A measure, long advocated,
-passed at this session, was the
Torrens system of land title re
gistration. This plan precludes
exhustveresearch each time
the property is transferred.
A third act is the appropriatiori
to encourage the teaching of agri
cultui-e in the public schools. The
bill carries $5,000 for this pur
pose; to be distributed among
schools which attempt to help
themselves.
That the object'might be thor
oughly investigated a r ui r a I
credits commission was created
composed of two members from
each house.
A school for the feeble minded
was also created.
The warehouse system was&con
tinued, without modification, and
ample provision made for its de
velopment and extension.
Decided .opposition was regis
tered against the State tax com
mission, but it was strengthened
by the creation of a board of re
view, to which board the work
of the commission will be subject.
IDifferent bills were introduced,
Ilooking to.the creation of a State
highway commission. T h i s
was withstood, but the work of
permanent highway improve
ment has received marked im
petus.
Several acts were also passed
of peculiar interest to day labor
ers. One of these compels tex
tile plants to have a weekly pay
day for wages earned that week.
Another is that creating con
tractors' lien on real estate, for
the erection of buildings and pro
viding supplies thus used. A
board of conciliation was also
created, with a personnel of three
to settle disputes between labor
and capital. One of these to be
appointed by the workmer- a sec
ond by the employers, and a third
by the governor, upon recom
mendation of the other two.
Another act was th,e provision
that the fiscal agent of the State|
board of charities and corrections
shall investigate the financial
status of parents and guardians
of scholarships and free tuitionI
beneficiaries,~and to make proper
report to the institution attended.
Prohibition laws were further>
modifed, both by reing- the
