A New Office In
' Pickens County
MissElizabothMauldin,daugh
ter of Mr. Elias Mauldin of Eas
ley, has been appointed Instruc
tor of domestic science for Pick
ens county, and will enter upon
the duties of the office March 1.
The place Miss Mauldin is to
fill has just been created for this
county, tho the need of it has
been felt for a long time. Most
of the other counties of the state
already maintain the place for
the benefit of the girls and wom
en. Miss Mauldin will have
charge of the tomato and can
ning clubs of the county, be
sides other domestic science work
and we feel sure the ladies, and
especially the school girls, will
find her work a great benefit to
them and its influence will be
felt in every home.
Miss Mauldin is a graduate of
Winthrop college and thoroly
understands the work of the do
mestic science department. She
has taught school in Pickens
county several years and is comn
petent'and popular.
The money to maintain this
place is mostly furnished by the
United States government, the
county having to furnish a small
part, the government's policy in
this case being to help those who
try to help themselves.
We shall watch this work with
much interest.
Discussed Fer
tilizer Question
T. A. Bowen, county agent,
conducted a fertifizer campaign
in Pickens county last weekand
had with him Agents Chapman
of Greenville county and Byars
of Anderson county. The ob
ject of the meetings was to dis
cuss fertilizers, how to use, how
.to buy and what to buy.
It was the consensus of opin
ion at these meetings thatit was
unneessary to even think of buy
ing fertilizer that contains any
potash, as it is selling now for
more than $500 per ton. As the
first six inches of soil in this sec
tion contains about 2000 pounds
of potash to the acre it is thought
this will be enough to last awhile
without buying any while the
price is so high.
Home-mixing of fertilizers is
advocated by niany experiment
stations, sonie claiming that it
effects a saving of from $7 to $10
a ton. Figures quoted by Clem
son College show a saving of
from $5 to $7 a ton by mixing at
home. 'Sixteen per cent acid and]
cottonseed meal will make a
good mixture, as will acid and
cattle tankgage.
The ammonia in tankage is de0
rived f r om t h ree different
sources: First, from blood; sec
ond, from flesh scr'aps; third,
from the bones. You will find
commercial fertilizers ammoni
ated tIus year with cottonseed
meal and tankage or blood, and
this is one of the times when
yon should knowv from wvhat
source this ammonia is derived.
A good deal of interest was
mianifested in the miertintgs last
wveek.
Some of the farmers have re
qJuested me to secure andl adver
tise cash prices of fertilizers. I
am not agent for any company,
but hope to put farmers in touch
with parties who have best
prices.
My advice is, if local dlealers
have oi' will give close prices for
cash, buy trnm them always. It
iup to the farmers to, save
everything they can. Quite a
nice little sum was saved last
year on the fertilizer' bill by
those who paid cash.
I will from time to time keep
prices adver'tised. The prices
belo0w are for fertilizer guaran
teed1 and dleliveredl to any station
in Pickens county:
10; per cenut acid, sacked,$10.57
per ton.
10-2 1-2-0, $22. 17 ton.
10-2-0, $20.53 ton.
9-2-0, $20.00 ton.
7 per cent cotton seed meal,
s:35.00 ton.
Cattle takage, containing (A
to 7 per cent ammonia, 8 to 1(1
per cent phosPhorus acid and i
l o 1 per cent potash, $35.0(0 a ton.
Clerks of Ctt k
of Picken&O0,(
Editor Pickens Senti '
my last communicatlin
you as nearly as I coul
names and a brief sketch of
different clerks of. Old Piel
District, and as Oconee and
ans are sister counties from .he
old mother district I have tid
to arrange similar list of thee
two counties', which may be of
interest to those who come here
after, while much of whAt'Ire
late may be well known to many
of your readers.
Robert A. Bowen was the
first clerk of court for Pickens,
county and made a tnost hohor
able and creditable record.. H6
served several years and yol u
thrily retired from tho office. qe
was for many yearg postmaster
at Pickens 0. H., ahd was POO
ular and satisfactory as ' uch
officer. Mr. Bowen made a brave
and gallant soldier in our.fratr.
cidal strife over secession andl
bears %pon his person evidence
of his patriotism--a wound re
ceived on one of the battlefields
of Virginia.
Mr. Bowen is still living in the
enjoyment of the fruits of his
honest toil and the society of
an interesting family and many
friends.
The writer knew Mr. Bowen
in his young manhood, andno
nobler youth ever listened to the
instructive voice df the vener
able John L. Kennedy within
the walls of old Thalian Acad- -
emy, where so many of our biil
liant and gifted young men re
ceived the rudiments of their
education.
The second clerk was John'A.
Lewis, whose long term of ser
vice proved his official efficiency,
and personal populary. Mr.
Lewis was for several years
United States commissioner andt
also U. S. Zieputy marshal. He,.
too, was a soldier in the Lost
Cause, was a good add true
man,a Christian gentleman,and
when he died a few years ago.
his death was lamented by ail
who knew him. He left a large
circle of influential relatives and"
friends in Pickens and Oconee.
He wassucceeded in the clerk's
ofico by Rev.J. M. Stewart,who
gave some of the best years of
his life to the service of his
country, and best of all, many
years of his life have bden de
voted to preparing his own ant
the souls of others for a brighter
world. In point of years the
Major is somewhat advanced,
but I am told he is in the enjoy
ment of good health and vouth
ful happiness.
Next coies the preyent incui
bent, A. John Boggs, who is too
well known as an officer, a man,
a citizen and a Christian to need
any praise from me. He was
too young to go to the wvar, but
his father, the lamented Aaron
Boggs, entered the army at an
advanced ago and was a lieu ten
ant in the cavalry company of'
Captain John W. L. Carey,
later commanded by Capt..John.
C. Calhoun.
Mr. Boggs is still a young naia
and it is hoped many years of
honor and happiness await him.

a witness in the case, having
seen Sim cross the road wvith a
sack of gees(e on his shoulder.
