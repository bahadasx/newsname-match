Died
Prof. A. A. Lyon, member of
family once locally prominent itnd
for several years past prinnpal of
the South Highland public school
in Birmingham, committed ' suicide
at hi home in that city at 8:30
o'clock Tuesday morning by shooting
l.irntelf throLj'h the brain.
Prof. Lyon belonged to a fairly
which in years gone by occupied an
exalted position in this city, :iaving
been the grandson of the late Rev.
James A. Lyon, who was for many
years pastor of the First Presbyte
rian church. His father the late
Dr. Augustus A. Lyon, was also well
known here, and this act of self de
struction, which is said to have re
sulted from despondency over the
recent death, occasioned general re
gret among Columbians who are ac
quainted with his family.
The following article which ap
peared in Tuesday's issue of the
Birmingtam News, gives details ef
the tragedy. v
"Prof. Lyon's condition has been
a source of worry to his family for
some time past. Tuesday morning he
waked as usual and ate his break
fast His son, who is a student at
the high school, had left the house,
and Prof. Lyon had on his overcoat
preparatory to leaving with hia little
. daughter . for the South Highland
"lie'wenf Into the batnroom, 'how
ever, and locked the door,. His con
tinued absence alarmed his sister-in-law,
and she knocked on the door,
informing him of the time. Prof.
, Lyon replied to her questions in a
normal voice,' but she was not satis
fied and called in her neighbor, Mr.
Turrentine. ,
"Prof. Lyon refused to answer
Mr. Turrentine's questions, and Mr.
Turrentine forced the lock on the
door. As he entered the room, Prof.
Lyon disappeared out of another
door, running down the stairs into
the back yard. Mr. Turrentine and
the sister-in-law followed and did
not see Mr: Lyon, who hid himself
behind a small chicken house. As
they caught sight of Prof. Lyon they
saw him raise a revolver to his head
and shoot himself through the right
eye.
"The bullet passed through the
brain and passed out through . the
base of the skull. Prof. Lyon, while
unconscious, lingered for an half
lour before his death.
"Mr. Lyon is survived by a son,
Hughes Lyon ; two daughters, Miss
Mary Lyon and Miss Elwin Lyon;
two brothers, Winters Lyon and Jas.
Lvon, of Nashville; a s;rter, Mis?
Aualine Lyon, of Nashvilie."

the local aggregation, which went to
the Forest county capital some three

The price of admission will be

HAPPENINGS OF INTEREST
GATHERED HERE M THERE
CIST OP NPWS FROM OVER THE
COUNTRY GIVEN IN A BRIEF
FORM.
Ohio cities, moved by President
Wilson'e preparedness speeches, are
getting ready to resist the invauer,
whosoever the enemy may be xnd
whensoever be may come, says a spe
cial from Cleveland. Citizens' mili
tary companies have been organized
rifle clubs formed and endorsements
framed by the chambers of corn
more. In Cleveland arrangements
were made for $ monster military
parade on Washington's birthday as
a dniMtHt4titiolt Oi tile t'ii' uttMt
of preparedness.
Only eighty-three arrests were
made at the San Francisco a posi
tion for drunkenness last year, al
though nearly 19,000,000 persons
passed through the turnstiles.
Henry Fofd, who is in New York
for the first time since his return
from the Ford peace expedition, has
denied that, he is planning a $1,000,
000 campaign against preparedness
for war.
News from the flooded districts
of Louisiana is to the effect that the
towns of Newlight, Marydale, Issa
quena, Dickard and Coutre Point,
previously unheard from, are in ur
gent need of assistance. The inhab
itants in these towns are in danger of
being drowned unless motor boats
are sent at once to their relief. Live
stock in these towns have been plac
ed on scaffolds and mounds in the
hope of keeping them above the
high spots on which the cattle are
corralled and unless speedy aid is
given they will perish.
An earth tremor of slight but dis
tinct nature that made itself felt
through Georgia, North and South
Carolina, Virginia and portions of
East Tennessee and Alabama, was
reported early Monday night as hav
mg been felt at about 6:45 p. m.
central time. In no case was any
damage reported and while in some
cases persons hurriedly left build
ings, there was nothing in the nature
of a panic.
A Zeppelin airship was brought
down by French guns in the vicinity
of Brabant-Le-Roi, in the Meuse, ac
cording to reports from Paris Tues
day. The Zeppelin was flying from
St. Menehould toward the south
when it was hit by an incendiary
shell, which caused it to ' fall in
flames in the vicinity of Brabant-
Le-Roi.

AT
DEATH OF AGED f.AN FOLLOWS
LONG AND EXCEEDINGLY
PAINFUL II LNESS.
After a long and, painful illness,
Mr. William Edward., who for some
time past had been living a short
distance west of C-lumbus on the
Macon road, passed away Monday
afternoon.
Mr. Edwards was native of Ixm
don, England, and hat he died so
far from his native 1 auih is account
ed for in the fact thu he was a nom
ad, and had travel, d extensively,
having made it a rule never to re
main in one placo; 2jong. He hud
been inbad health for quite an ex
tended period and came to this sec
tion in the hope that the change
would be physically beneficial to
him. The hope, however, proved a
vain one, for instead of improving
he steadily grew worse and sank
lower and lower until the final dis
solution took place. ,
At the time of his death Mr. Ed
wards was CG years of age, and sur
viving him are his widow, two sons,
Messrs. J. T. and Harry Edwards,
and four daughters, Mrs. Roger
O'Hara, Mrs. James McNally, Mrs.
David Boswell and Miss Mary Ann
Edwards.
The funeral was held at the fam
ily home at 3 o'clock Monday after
noon, and interment of the body in
Friendship cemetery followed.

BiRMiNEHAM PREPARING
FOR VETERANS COMING
EVERY ARRANGEMENT WILL
BE MADE FOR COMFORT
OF OLD SOLDIERS.
Many Columbians are interested
in the forthcoming reunion of the
United Confederate Veterans at
Birmingham, as the proximity of the
Magic City makes it easy to reach,
and there will be in attendance not
only a large number of local veter
ans but many pleasure seekers as
well. The following article from
the Birmingham Ledger of Monday
afternoon regarding arrangements
that are being made for the reunion
will therefore be "read' with, avidity
here:
"At a regular meeting of Camp
Hardee much interest was manifest
ed in the arrangements being made
by the Chamber of Commerce and
other civic bodies and the several
committees appointed, who have in
charge the proper entertainment of
visitors who may attend the reunion.
The earnest hope was expressed that
the impression was not permitted to
go abroad that the tents and cots
loaned will be the manner of caring
for and housing the visiting veter
ans, but the tents will be provided
for emergencies or for those veter
ans who prefer to use them.
"Also it was urged that the com
mittees be asked to provide automo
biles and carriages for the use of
the veterans in the parade and that
the marching on foot be eliminuted
from the program.
"At this meeting a letter was read
from Chief Marshall McCroswin in
viting all veterans in this section to
join the Elks and attend the min
strel show to be given at the Jeffer
son theatre on February 23, stating
that the proceeds arising from this.
show would be equally divided be
tween the l'M9 and the expenses of
the reunion in May. The camp ac
cepted this invitation with expres
sions of appreciation by appropriate
esolution."

A negro cabin, located on North
Fourth street, between Fifth and
Sixth avenues, was destroyed by
fire Monday. Another cabin nearby
was badly damaged.
The alarm was turned in about ft

The house that was destroyed was
owned by Mr, narvey ravage, anu
the loss was covered by insurance.
