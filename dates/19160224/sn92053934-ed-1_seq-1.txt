Not Alter Course.
GERMAN NOTE AWAITED
Military Circles in Berlin
Said Not to Care Whether
Break Comes.
Washington, Feb. SI. Senator
Gore announced today he would
effer a concurrent resolution that
Americans should keep off armed
belligerent ships.
Senator Gore sought to intro
duce his resolution by unanimous
consent hut Senator ISrandegee, re
publican, objected, mid shut the
proposal ont. Senator Gore will
try again tomorrow.
Senate leaders agreed to adjourn
tonight until tomorrow instead of con
tinuing the old legislative day by re
cess. That will give Senator Gore an
opportunity to introduce his resolu
tion and his bill and it is expected the
senate will debate the issue fully.
Senator Gore sought to introduce
his bill to prohibit passage of Ameri
cans on such ships, and also to intro
duce a concurrent resolution, requir
ing passage by the house, but unlike
his bill, not the approval of the presi
dent. Senator Gore issued a statement de
claring "It seems to me the ship of
state is drifting or driving headlong on
the breakers. I do not say deliberate
ly, but I fear directly on the break
ers." When asked about reports that he
had conferred with former Secretary
Bryan before preparing his bill and
resolution, Senator Gore said:
"I have not seen Mr. Bryan since
last January. I did not talk to him at
that time about the bills on this sub
ject I had then introduced. Of course,
I kngw that Mr. Bryan favors action
such as I propose."
Senator Gore's resolution follows:
"Whereas, a number of leading pow
ers of the world are now engaged in
a war of unexampled proportions and,
"Whereas, the United States is hap
pily at peace with all of the belliger
ent nations, and,
"Whereas, it is equally the desire
and the interest of the American peo
ple to remain at peace with all na
tions, and,
"Whereas, the president has recent
ly offered fresh and signal proofs of
the superiority of diplomacy to butch
ery as a method of settling interna-
'ional disputes, and,
"Whereas, the right of American
citizens to travel on unarmed belliger
ent vessel:? has recently received re
newed guarantees of respect and In
violability, and.
"Whereas, the right of American
citizens to travel on armed belligerent
vessels rather than on unarmed ves
sels is essential neither to their life,
liberty or safety, nor to the independ
ence, dienitv or security of the United
States, and,
"Whereas, congress alone has been
vested with the power to declare war
hlch involves the obligations to pre
vent war by all proper means consist
ent with the honor and vital Interest
of the nation, now,
"Therefore, be it resolved by the
senate and the house of representatives
concurring, that it is the sense of the
congress, vested as It is with the sole
Power to declare war, that all per
sons owing allegiance to the United
States should In behUf of their own
safety and the vital interest of the
United States, forebear to exercise th
right to travel as passengers on any
armed vessel of any belligerent power,
whether such vessel be armed for of
fensive or defensive purposes, and It

that no passport should be Issued or

THE WAR
TODAY
The great German drive for Yer
dnn, the biggest military opera
tion on the western front since the
allied offensive of last September
and productive of one of the most
desperate battles of the war, Is be
ing pushed with tremendous force
by the army of the German crown
prince.
The Teutonic lines are being
steadily drawn nearer and nearer
the fortress, according to the Ber
lin war office, which today an
nounces the driving of another
wedge Into the French line. It
claims a German advance through
the village of Haumont and the
capture of Samognenx, about six
miles distant from Verdun proper.
Elsewhere also the Germans
have scored advances, occupying
the wooded district north of Beau
mont and the woods of Herbe, to
the northeast, while the the north
west the village of Brabant has
been occupied.
The French war office, on the
other hand, announces that the
French lines have not been broken
at any point by the terrific assaults
of the 800,000 Germans engaged in
the offensive. It admits the loss
of the village of Brabant, hlch it
characterizes as an advanced posi
tion, but dispntes the German
claim to the capture of Sumog
neux. An attack on that village
was repulsed, it is declared.
Along the 2.-iuile front on which
the German attack is bring direct
ed, the fighting has been of the
most desperate character.. Appar
ently it has been particularly in
tensive near Beaumont, one of the
strongest of the French positions,
but wave after wave of German
infantry rolling against the de
fenses have failed to dislodge the
French. They have been driven
out of part of the wood of Caures,
but their lines are holding further
to the east, In front of Ornes.
At Lisbon, Portugal, yesterday
the commander of the naval divis
ion, apparently of his own Initia
tive, took forcible possession of
86 German and Austrian ships ly
ing In the Tairns river, hoisted the
Portuguese flar and saluted them
with a 21-gnn salvo from the Por
tuguese fleet It Is said the act of
the Portuguese commander was
totally unexpected by the govern
ing authorities.

positions facing Terdnn, according
to Information received by Berlin
by the Evening ews by way of

It is reported that the emperor

Berlin, Feb. 24, (via London, 3:12
p. m.) Further gams lor the Germans
in the region north of the French fort
ress of Verdun were reported by the
war office today. The statement says
the entire wooded district northwest
of Beaumont and the forest of Herbe
are in possession of the Germans.
Announcement also was made of the
capture by the Germans of the villages
of Brabant, Haumont and Samogneux,
in the Verdun region.
The statement follows: "Western

Samogneux is about one mile south
of Haumont, the loss of which was
admitted yesterday by the French war
office. It is six miles north of Verdun,
London, Feb. 24. At last accounts
the battle of Verdun was still raging
with great fury, both sides keeping up
a continuous fire from all available
artillery and throwing masses of
troops into the fray. Losses on each
3ide have been heavy.
In the fighting during the second
day of the great battle the Germans

CAPITAL NEXT TO
CHECK TIP TRUST
District of Columbia May Copy Merritt
Law Enacted by the Illinois
Legislature.
Springfield, 111., Feb. 24. Official
Washington hopes to be relieved of
the tipping evil by means of legisla
tion, in the opinion of Edward L. Mer1
ritt, state representative and author
of the Merritt anti-tipping law. Rep
resentative Merritt said today thaj he
had turned a copy of the Illinois law,
enacted by the last legislature, over
to United States District Attorney
Knotts. Mr. Knotls said he was for
warding the copy of the bill to the at
torney general's office at Washington
in response to a request.
The Illinois law makes it unlawful
for hotels, cafes, or similar places to
sell or lease tipping privileges and
provides that when an individual re
ceives a tip the tip belong to that
individual. If the tip is turned over
to another person that act is a mis
demeanor.
"Washington is overrun by the worst
tip trust in the country," said Repre
sentative Merritt, "and I am not sur
prised that they are beginning to seek
relief in the District of Columbia."
Thus far there has not been any
successful prosecution of violators of
the law in Illinois, but Representa
tive Merritt said he planned to carry
a case to the supreme court, so as to
get a ruling on the constitutionality
of the law and that when this was done
he expected better success in enforc
ing his pet law.

Companions of Captain Salomone Fall
Beside Him As He Directs Bald
on LIbach.
Milan, (via Paris), Feb. 24. Details
are now published of the raid carried
out on last Friday by an Italian air
squadron on Libach, a. city of 30,000,
about forty-five miles east of Goritza,
and it is declared to have been emin
ently successful, chiefly on account
of the heroism of Captain Salomone,
who piloted a large machine carrying
four men. The task entrusted to this
machine was to engage adversary air
craft in order to allow the other Italian
machines to accomplish their mission
of bombardment. Captain Salomone
attacked several Austrian aeroplanes
and in the battle which ensued two of
his companions were killed and he
himself wounded. He continued, how
ever, to handle his machine so suc
cessfully that his observer, Colonel
Barbieri, was able to keep up a steady
machine gun fire on the Austrians.
Bullets rainea on the Italian aero
plane from all sides and Colonel Bar
bieri was killed. The pilot remained
alone with the bodies of his compan
ions hindering the manipulation of the
levers, that of Colonel Bargierl lying
across one of the steering wires. W tp
ing the blood from his eyes, for he was
wounded in the forehead. Captain Sa
lomone managed to move the body and
that of another man so that he could
steer more easily and, having suffici
ently delaved the pursuers to enable
his fellow aviators to reach their goal,
he finally landed at Palmanova and
was taken from his machine in a faint
ing condition. King Victor Emmanuel
has awarded him the medal for valor.

DYING MESSAGES
FROM A ZEPPELIN
Bottle Containing Letters 'Written by
Commander to His Family Fonnd
In the North Sea.
London, Feb. 24 (11:40 a. m.) A
bottle has been picked up from the
sea containing last messages from the
commander of Zeppelin L-19, which
was wrecked in the North sea, and ad
dressed to the commander's parents,
wife and little son. The last of the
message stated that the airship had
dropped and the crew was drowning,
says a Reuter dispatch from Copen
hagen.
The yacht Stella picked up the bottle
containing the messages from Com
mander Uhle, near Gothenburg. Four
letters were found, two addressed to
the parents of the Zeppelin command
er and one each to his wife and child.
The letters were written at successive
Twriods. The third states that the
airship was then 100 metres above the
water, that the motors had failed to
act, and that all were expecting at
any moment to drop. The fourth let
ter states that the airship had dropped
and the crew was drowning.
The L-19 was wrecked in the North
sea shortly after the Zeppajin raid
over England on Jan. 31. tt is be
lieved to have been one of the Zep
pelins which took part in the raid,
having been damaged either by British
anti-aircraft guns or by Dutch coast
defense guns which fired on a dirigi
ble that flew over Dutch territory at a
low altitude.
The captain of the British trawler
King Stephen reported that he had
encountered the L-19 in a sinking con
dition in the North sea, but did not at
tempt to rescue the Germans, as they
outnumbered his crew.
WHEAT HIT HARD
BY RECALL TALK
haT optin Props More Than Seven
j - 1 '
Cents on Rumor of Possible
Break With Berlin.
Chicago, Feb. 24. Disturbing ru-
mors that drastic consequences would j
result from tension between 'Washing
ton and Berlin regarding Germany's
submarine policy caused a break of
more than 7 cents a bushel today in
the price of wheat, as compared with
values current earlier in the session.
The gist of the rumors was that the
handing of passports to the German
! ambassador was imminent.
The most sensational fall took place
in the price of the May option, which
dropped from 1.244 to 1.17, a loss of
7V cents. The low point was down 10
cents a bushel as compared with fig
ures that were obtained on Monday.
For the great part, the losses took
place in the last 15 minutes of the
session and were accompanied by wild
efforts on the part of holders to un
load. Closing prices showed a slight re
action, but were 5 to h cents under
yesterday's finish, with May at 1.17 V
and July at 1.14.

Negro Alderman, Thompson
Supporter, Tries to Stop
One of Investigations. . '
COMMITTEE CONFUSED
Welfare Department Em
ployes Deny Having Do
nated Part of Salaries. ;
Chicago, Feb. 24. Uproar and con
fusion marked the opening session to
day of the city council committee in
vestigating the split salary charges
made by Mrs. Page Waller Eaton, re
signed superintendent of social sur
veys, against her former superior,
Mrs. Louise Osborne Rowe, commis
sioner of the department of public
welfare.
Mrs. Eaton's testimony was delayed
by the action of Oscar Depriest, negro
alderman and one of Mayor Thomp
son's supporters In the council, who
challenged the legality of the investi
gation and moved that Mrs. Eaton be
not permitted to testify. Hts motion
prevailed until Alderman Buck, com
mittee member and council opponent
of Mayor Thompson, arrived. Depriest
continued to argue against the Inves
tigation. Other committee members
joined in the clamor and personal en
counters for a time seemed likely.
Meanwhile the civil service commis
sion had called Mrs. Eaton. Her coun
sel, Seymour Stedman, explained she
would gladly appear before the com
mission later. The commissioners then
listened to testimony from various em
ployes of the public welfare depart
ment, who declared they had never
been asked to contribute any funds
by their superiors.
The council committee has asked
the following to appear: Mayor and
Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Margaret E.
Mivelaz, sister of Mrs. Thompson and
alleged recipient of the graft money;
Mrs. Rowe, Mrs. Eaton, Alderman W.
E. Rodriguez, who made the original
charges before the council and who
is said to have been a witness to pay
ment of money to Mrs. Rowe, and Ful
ton Gardner, also said to have wit
nessed the payment of money. Mayor
and Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Mivelaz
will not appear, and It is thought that
Mrs. Rowe will also decline th In
vitation.
Many Summoned.
Those for whom subpoenas were Is
sued by the civil service commission
include:
Mrs. Eaton, Mrs. Rowe, Alderman
Rodriguez, Seymour Stedman, coun
sel for Mrs. Eaton; Fulton Gardner
and Edward J. Brundage. Twenty
one employes of the department of
public welfare were also summoned.
Pending the outcome of the investi
gation by the commission all salaries
in the department of public welfare
will be held up, it was announced.
Mayor and Mrs. Thompson have also
been summoned to appear before the
commission, it is said, and will be
present.
The law prohibits the soliciting or
political contributions from a civil
service employe and also prohibits the
payment of money by a civil service
employe for appointment. It was
pointed out, therefore, that both Mrs.
Eaton and Mrs. Rowe would b held
liable if the charges are substantiat
ed. The act provides a penalty of $50
to $1,000 or imprisonment, or both.
Doesn't Seed Graft Money.
Mrs. Margaret E. Mivelaz, sister-in-law
of Mayor Thompson, who Mrs.
Eaton charged was to be the benefic
iary of her divided salary payments,
is the widow of John Mivelaz, who
was a well-to-do restaurant keeper in
Louisville, Ky.
Dispatches from Louisville today
said that Mivelaz left on estate val
ued at $80,000. Mrs. Mivelaz has de
nied that she was in financial straits
and her friends assert she does not
require assistance.
Among other angles to be discussed
in the investigation Is a statement that
Una Foster, Junior stenographer In the
department of public welfare, was
compelled to falsify public records by
crediting the department with secur
ing employment for needy persons
when it had not done so.
The council committee convened be
fore the civil service investigation be
gan. Mrs. Eaton began her testimony.
