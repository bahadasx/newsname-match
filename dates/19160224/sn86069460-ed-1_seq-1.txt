GRADUATES OF
L
Problem of What to Do With Them
-Need and Must Have More
Room and Equipment
This is Crittenden's banner
year for common school gradu
ates. Already there are one
hundred and two who have suc
cessfully passed the required ex
amination, and the May exami
nation is yet to come. Last year
was our best year up to that.
We had seventy-live for the
county. Before this the number
had ranged from thirty to fifty.
The ages of these at present time
range from thirteen to seven
teen. Time was when the ages
ranged from eighteen to twenty
four. An approximate estimate
shows that at least, fifty percent
of all the eighth grade pupils in
the rural schools this year com
pleted the "work, took the' re
quired examination And received
their promotion certificates. An
optomistic consideration of these
conditions indicate improvement
in many ways: efficient teachers,
longer terms, uniform course of
study and daily program, more
liberal laws, better equipped
houses and grounds, together
with some other things that could
be thought of. It all means
progress. There are many other
things that could be done to
make the schools of the county
more efficient and come nearer
accomplishing the object of their
mission, but I will mention only
one here. The tub-districts are
too smalL We have too many
schools to maintain with the
meant we have at hand. The
work is not sufficiently amassed,
but there are plans formulating
which will help this condition.
When this is done and other Im
provements are brought to bear
the country boy and girl will be
able to complete the common
school work by the time they are
thirteen or fourteen years old.
This brings us face to face with
another grave problem. What
will we do with the common
school graduate? Really this
question is upon us now.

every-day life with all the lights
and shadows entitled ''Engaged
By Wednesday," was presented
by the Junior Class of the Ma
rion High School at the Audito

The spacious hall was filled to
over-flowing, long before the
hour for the curtain to go up,
The friends of all the players
being in evidence in the audi
ence. The performance was giv
en for the benefit of the Audito
rium's new stage, which has
been put in and the proceeds of
this entertainment paid for it.
As usual the sweetest of music

Martin Henry, Herman Boucher;
Arthur Watson, Huston Hughes;
Jack, Ted, Dick.-fnends of Ar

ham, Floyd Frazer; Miss. Abigail
Persons, Ruth Travis; Mrs. Wat

ginia Fianary;-i!arr, Martin
Henry's aunt-Ruby Vaughn;
Hrst Girl, Anna Stembridge;
Second Girl. Stella Elkins; First
Gypsy, Iva Bigham; Second Gyp
sy, Ruby Dean.
The audience was in a roar al
most from the time the curtain
went up and everyone was in
quiring, "Who is Martin Henry."
Mr. Herman Boucher who play
ed the part, being a stranger to
many of our people. He is a son
of Rev. Carl T. Boucher and was
complimented highly on his work.
"Arthur Watson," leading
man of the play, was represent
ed by Huston Hughes, who re
ceived many enconiumt of praise
on bis talent, as did his chums,
"Jack," "Ted" and "Dick,"
Joe Hunter, Sylvan Bigham and
Floyd Frazer, each of whom im
mortalized himself.
Miss Ruth Travis, as "Miss
Abigail Persons" the old maid
aunt, with several curls, was the
personification of precision and
wanted to do things up to the
minute by the clock. She was
good. Her niece, "Miss Lucile
Persons," the leading lady, was
ably represented by Miss Miriam
Pierce.
"Mrs. Watson," the mother of
Arthur, was a tall, stately and
dignified matron of rare beauty
and refinement and in assigning
this part to Mia Jewel Rankin,
a gem was selected indeed. Miss
Rankin's acting was exceptional.
The friends of Lucile. "Ma
rie," "Jane' and "Mabel" and
other girls in their parts were all
sweet and lovely girls and added
much charm to the play. One
to tee them would have thought
they had been there before.
Martin's Aunt Mary, the do
mestic, waa as good as any of
them. Miss Ruby Vaughn took
this character.
Misses Ivy Bigham and Ruby
Dean, the gypsies, acted like
"sure enough' one's, in moe
ways than one, not forgetting to
help themselves to all the clothes
ana chickens in sight.
Midway School Closes.
Midway school closed Friday,
Feb. 11th, with a grand enter
tainment, which Was declared
by several to be the finest en
tertainment which was ever held
at Midway or adjoining districts.
Miss Etta Boistur, our teacher,
had everything arranged to nice.
The way the children spoke their
pieces showed ut that their
teacher knew how to train them
for the occasion.
We hope to have Mist Etta
with ut again next year, at we
all have learned to love her.

$600,000 Road Bonds.
Owensboro, Ky., Feb. 22.
The decision of the court of ap
peals at Frankfort in the case of
Bowman against Fayette county,
wherein the court ruled that it
required only a majority of the
voters of the county to instruct
fiscal courts to issue road bonds
will mean that Daviess county
will issue $600,000 worth of road
bonds this year. Last year an
election was held and the bond
proposition failed to get a two
thirds vote by seventy-two votes
However, local attorneys inves
tigated the law and held that
the amendment to the road law
only required a majority vote in
a bond issue.

LETTER FROM
HEP. ED. STONE
Tells All About What is Happening
in The State Legislature
at Frankfort
DEAR FRIENDS:
A few more weeks and this
session of the Kentucky State
Legislature will adjourn, leaving
an unjust burden on the people.
I introduced a resolution provi
ding for a committee to be ap
pointed from the House and Sen
ate with the power to inquire in
to and investigate the expendi
tures of all departments of the
State, and suggest ways and
means of curtailing expenses and
reducing the number of employ
es, said resolution was buried in
the house.
The State-wide prohibition
amendment met with defeat in
the Senate and House. I labor
ed asd voted for the amendment,
I have satisfactory evidence of a
sufficient majority to pass the
Dog Bill in the House and as to
the Senate's attitude in regard
to said bill I cannot state accur
ately. One of the most important
questions to the people of this
state is taxation and yet this ses
sion has made no effort to con
sider a revision of the tax law.
This Democratic administration
owes an equitable tax system to
the people, and that could have
been done at this session of the
legislatue. Yet, realizing that
no one man or set of men can,
rukvk majority. I have complied
with every promise made by me
to my constituents. Those
promised measures should be, by
right and justice to the people
enacted into law.
As I have promised mv con-
stitutents heretofore that I shall
hold no party predjudice, but
labor daily for the welfare and
future betterment of the people
of Crittenden and Livingston
counties, upholding the banner
of clean government, clean pol
itics and manhood. Every rep
resentative owes to his people
protection, he was elected to
render a square deal to the mass
of the people.
We should advocate the pro
motion of genuine popular gov
ernment in our state and nation,
and the defense of human rights,
and the establishment of social
and industrial justice, bo that
every force in the community
may be directed toward securing
for the average man and woman
a higher, better and fuller life in
the things of the body no less
than those of the mind and soul
Every great resolution among
the nations of the earth has been
the fruit of unrestrained greed
and avarice. It was the greed
and avarice of the barons that
drove Cromwell into rebellion.
The injustice and cruelty of the
wealthy classess of France
brought on the terrible revolution
that devastated the most highly
cultivated nation among men. It
was the greed and avarice of the
slave owner that brought on the
war of the great rebellion. Our
menace is the greed and avarice
of men who seek to control leg
islation for personal gain, and to
correct the evils that grow out
ef this condition we must place
more responsibility upon the
average citizen, put greater pow
er into the people's hands, bo
that the voter at the polls can
cure the corruptness and evils
that exist in our legislative halls
by electing true, honest, tntelli
gent and patriotic men to frame
the laws under which they are to
live, and be governed by; the
rank and file of the people be
lieve in justice, I have confidence
in their intelligence, I have faith
in their sense of justice, and be
lieve that the institutions of our
country are safe in their hands.
Government of the people, for
the people and by the people is
in my judgement one of the most
important questions of the age.
The people are indignant against
the repeated and flagrant viola
tion by men who pledge them
protection, justice and a clean
administration, and then, after
election, repudiate and violate
their solemn obligations. The
people are indignant against leg
islators, and members of Citv
Councils and County officers who
are continually thwarting the
will of the people and voting
against wholesale legislation at
the instance of gigantic corpor
ations of the state and cities.
The battle cry of the rule of the
people is spreading throughout
the entire land without regard to
political affiliation.., I f m,
Your obedient servant,
Edward D. Stone,
Frankfort, Ky.
