By Associated riess
Washington. P"eb. 24. Congress]
assembled to-day with the agitation;
for action warning Americans off bel- j
ligerent ships overshadowing all other
questions. President Wilson's sup
porters, apprehensive that the smoul
dering sentiment might suddenly
blaze up to embarrass the diplomatic
negotiations with Germany were
working to hold the administration
forces in line and keep the question
from the floor of both House and Sen-'
ate. The legislative situation In bothl
houses favored the administration
forces. The Senate was in the legisla
tive day of yesterday which prevented
the subject from coming up without
unanimous consent. The situation in
the House was similar but not so se
rious. If an outburst came tlie load
ers expected it would be there. Word
went to the Capitol again early to-day
that President Wilson's opposition to
any action by Congress was unshaken )
and that Chairman Stone and Flood, i
of the committees dealing with for- 1
eign affairs, could explain his position I
fully. Administration officials outside 1
of Congress professed to be undlsturb- 1
ed by the agitation at the capitol and
expressed confidence that the Presi
dent's position would be supported.
Calms Down
As members of both houses assem
bled for to-day's sessions the situation
appeared to have calmed considerably,
although there still were evidences of
opposition to the President's deter
mination to insist that Americans have
a right to travel on merchant ships of
a belligerent. The exact status of the
situation was explained as follows:
Many members of the House and
some in the Senate, being much in the
■ lark as to exact facts in the nego
tiations with Germany, fear that it
would lead to war if Americans are
not kept off armed merchantmen and
if Germany should actuate the deter
mination io sink armed merchant ves
sels whether armed for offense or only
for defense.
