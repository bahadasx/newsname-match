(Special to The Farmer.)
. New Haven, Feb. : 24 Six
pertinent facts were7 brought
out today in the inquiries into
the wreck at Indian River, Mil
ford. On-them will depend" the
finding of the authorities. They
disprove -several ' theories. '
The facts are:' 1 ; ' ,
jf " Engineer Curtis ran. nis train

signals, at a speed that bag been'
estimated as high as. 50 miles an
1 hour. : i ' ' '
The signals were set against

A freight train was. very near
the : spot where Toartelotte lost
his life, at the time he' was hit.
Ttte brakes of .Enghieer Cur
tis' train were applied after he
A bad passed the signals and after
his -train had hit Toartelotte.
The accommodation train was
running contrary to schedule, -'
' only three; minntes .behind .the
express.
Coroner Ell B. Mix continued! his
:,' Inquiry today.' Ha said he found that
KFriBrCurtl ran his ..train Pjst
."a point east of the wreck at a peed
' estimated at between 25 and 60 miles

Engineer Curtis passed Ills ' distant'
signal, set at caution. That was 7,000
feet behind "the scene' of the; collis
ion. . ,.!: '.','' .' ' ' . '' . "
He found that Engineer ' Curtis
also ran past the home signal, set at
both danger and caution, and that he
maintained the same speed. -
Trainman; Charles Short testified
that he. felt the air1 -brakes applied
Just before the crash, ' and after the
signals were passed. W. B-; Grant, con-
ductor, corroborated this.
This is taken to disprove, the theory
that. Curtis was dead, or unconscious.
, . further inquiry will be made, into it.
At 66-Clark's Hill ayenue, Stamford,
the widow of the engineer said: "I
don't want to blame anyone because I

That one of the most proninent Armenians in America
was a victim of the 'wreck, at Indian River Tuesday morning
was discovered last night when the body of the man believed

The body was taken in charge by 1 several noted speeches for- the good
Ardash Keolejan, of 2110 Broadway,
New Xork, although friends in'Bos
ton and Providence were deirous of
caring for it. . Shahinian" was to have
lectured before the ' Armenian club
in New York on Tueday evening and
his absence led to inquiries in Boston.
The search finally led to this town.
Keolejan is said to have had suffered
at the hands of the Turks, who; ha?
also killed members of his family.'
' The identification was made . by A.
H. Keolian, a wealthy oriental, rug
dealer with headquarters in Sixth av

rived in Mitford last evening and -visited

8, 1914 and Nov. 23, of the same year,
decided that, Portugal would co-operate
with the allies whenever' that step
seemed necessary. The Portuguese

Enjoin Strikers From
Maintaining Pickets.
That .the company is -employing
more men now than at t'ie time the

sion, made yesterday afternoon in the
superior -court By Julius Brenilnger,
vice-president and . superintendent of
the Max Ams'Co. of Fairfield, which
is asking-Judge Gairer to enjoin the
strikers from ' maintaining pickets
near the factory. Brenzinger said at
the time" of the strike there were 110
men employed at "the factory and the
number. -jthei-e at present is 190. He
said thecompany would like to have
about 300 at 'work.
Brenzinger said the company is be
hind in its orders but admitted that
about 'f3ie same amount of work is
being turned out as at the tinie -when
were no strike- pickets about the
plant. Brenzinger , told of the origin
of the trouble with the men. He re
lated hew he hud conferred . with the
committee of employes and made "a
new agreement regarding hours and
pay.. V,: . , .'. -.-
Later . he" said . the men demanded
that an employe named Taylor be re
instated and another employe named
Pahnisch be discharged. Brenzinger
refused to grant 'either request. He
told how the men walked ..out and
how they tried to induce the engineer
to join them. -'
When the strikers put - pickets
around the plant Brenzinger said the
company hired detectives to escort
employes ,to and from work. The
witness declared he watehed the pic
kets through field glasses and saw
them intercept employes, i He watch
ed from a distance of 300; or 400 feet.

The guns were'' still conspicuous on

Washifigton, ' Feb. 24 Con- i

agitation for action warning i

over-shadowing all other ques
tions. . : ',
President Wilson's support
ers, apprehensive that the
smouldering - senlimnt might
suddenly blaze up to embarrass
the 7 diplomatic negotiations;
with Germany, were working
to hold the ' administration
forces in; line and keep the
question from the. floor of both
House and Senate. , 3
The legislative situation iai
both houses .favored the ad
ministration forces: The Sen-:
ate was In i the legislative day
of yesterday which prevented
thle subject .from coming . up i
without unanimous consent-!
The situation in the House was !
similar, but not so secure.
Word went to the : capitol
again early today that Presi-;
dent Wilson's opposition to any !
action ' by Congress was un-
shaken and that Chairmen.
Stone and Flood; of the com-i
mittees dealing with foreign
affairs could explain his posi-'
tion fully. i '
' ' It was apparent that much of tha '
chafing in Congress vas-due to a lack
of information of the President's atti-
tude. The foreign affairs committee,
in accordance-with its action of last.
night began a canvass of sentiment
in the House to develop the extent to
which resolutions of - warning would
be: supported' and at the same time
disclose the opposition to such pro
posals. ; . ' . '" ':
The Republicans generally were
opposed .to such action and aside
from the score of Democrats who yes
terday showed signs of breaking over
administration restraint, the majority
forces today apparently wete being
held by. the appeal, - "stand by the
President.'? v.
Statements that . the agitation had !
attained the proportions of arevolt!
against the President's policy were
flatly denied on all hands and there
was no outward evidence to support
the statement. . Likewise, statements
that the Democrats had given the
President' a certain time, 48 hours, it
was stated, to change has policy, also
were denied by ' everyone to whom
they were attributed; ' .
that the whole situation might be re
duced to a proposal that Congress ex
press thei sentiment that Americans
should not bring their country into
danger 'of war by travelings on ships
which Germany has, announced sha
will sink "without , warning. .
;It was pointed out that such action
would be quite different than legisla
tion prohibiting Americans from tak
ing passage on .such ships as some of
the pending bills and resolutions pro
pose, and could not be viewed as aj
surrender of rights. " ' xj
, The extent to which the political!
element enters into the .present sltua-f1
tion has. not been disclosed. Admin-,
istration supporters, however, recall j
that former Secretary' of State Bryan
broke relations and left the cabinet
over the question 'ti warning Amerl-!
cans ofC belligerent ships. Among,
those who now are supporting the agi
tation are "some senators and repre-,
sentatives who have been numbered I
among Mr. Bryan's adherents.
The President Is represented as hav
