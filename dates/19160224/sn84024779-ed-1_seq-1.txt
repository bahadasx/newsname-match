DEMOCRATS HOLD
BIG BANQUET
Lut Tuesday Evening at Fargo
When Many Notable Speak
er* Were Present
MEETING ViS HARMONIOUS
And Was Largely Attended And
Messages From Prominent
Democrats Rsad
A small-sized bomb was drop
ped into the Democratic Achieve
ment banquet at the Fargo Audi
torium last evening when I. J.
Dunn of Nebraska, the principal
speaker of the evening, opened) up
an attack on the preparedness
propaganda. The remarks of the
epeaker called forth an interrup
tion from United States Marshal
Doyle, who took exception to some
of Mr. Dunn's statements and ask
ed if the speaker did not think he
was overstepping the grounds ol
propriety in coming to a meeting
of this kind and making a cri
ticism of the president.
"Why this violent attack on
Wilson's program if you agree
with him that we need prepared
ness for defense?" was one ques
tion Mr. Doyle asked.
Mr. Dunn replied) that he was
entirely within his rights, as he
had notified the committee be
fore coming to Fargo as to what
the nature of his speech would
be. He stated further that he did
not allow any man to do his think
ing for him and he was not going
to let any man do his speaking
for him.
The first part of Mr. Dunn's
speech was in perfect harmony
with the addresses of the other
speakers on the program, Sena
tor Purcell, J. T. O'Connor and
Mrs. Keough.
Mr. Dunn niade a particularly
able defense of the president's
Mexican policy, of the adminis
tration's foreign policy and of the
tariff law, the banking law, and
other constructive measures that
have been put into force under
democratic rule. He had talked for
about an hour on these subjects
when he suddenly launched into
the preparedness part of his
speech.
He staled that lie belived in pre
paredness ..against any "probable"
attack but did not believe in a
program such as has been pro
posed. He took exception to some
of the statements that had been
made by Senator Purcell.
"We are toK\ that we need to
prepare lor war," said Mr. Dunn.
"What kind oi a war are we
going to prepare for, a war of ag
gression or a war of defense?
"W* are told that we an: in dau
ger of attack.
"Who is going to attack us and
wliy?
"There is something more than
sentiment in war. War means
seas of gore. It is an easy mutter
to talk about war, but mi tlie peo
ple of America realize what they
are engendering when they plan a
great militaristic propaganda?
Il'iiey are planning to send their
young men out to be food for
powder.
"Why?
"If'there is any need for pre
paring for war for U'fense 1 am
willing to prepare, but where is
this war coming from?
Senator Puroell Interrupts
After he had made some state
ments that seemed to reflect oa
Wilson's preparedness program.
Senator Purcell, who was on the
platform, interrupted, to ask if
the president did »iot believe in a
program for defense only and not
for aggression.
The speaker paused to take a
drink of water.
"I don't know," he repliedi
"Neither does Senator Purcell
know." Mr. Dunn remarked, turn
ing to the audience.
"Neither does ony Democrat in
this room know.
"I thought the president was
against preparedness for aggres
sion and aggrandizement but
since his recent western trip I
hardly know what to think. I cer
tainly will never support any pro
gram for a .navy incomparably the
greatest in the world," which Mr.
Wilson advocated in his St. Louis
speech.
"We are told that we should
have a navy that would protect
our commerce anywhere in the
world. If that means that we
must have a navy large enough to
send warships to protect every
vessel of the steel trust or the oil
Lrust, then I am opposed to it.
"I am going to oppose any plan,
no matter if it is sponsored by ev
en such a great man as the pres
ident, that is for aggression or ag
grandizemenf.
wr' v.1
Washington and Madison are
being quoted as saying that the
best guarantee of protection is
preparedness. If they said that, all
I can say is that their premises
were not sound. It is not true andi
as proof of this I will point you
to the countries of Europe which
are now madly engaged in the
bloodiest and cruelest war ever
known, and those countries were
prepared^ It was their prepared
ness that made the war.
"It is easy to conjure up fright
ful things. Many of these things
are possible but most of them are
not probable. What have I to offer
in proof of that assertion. I sim
ply point you to the history of
your country. This nation has nev
er been attacked. In every war that
this country has been engaged,
this country declared war.
"Our exposed coast lines that
we hear so much about have been
there ever since this nation was
a weak, struggling little country.
They have never been attacked.
More than that n« nation has ever
threatened to attack them until we
had first declared war. Every war
we have ever had has been of our
own choosing.
"Now we are the greatest and
wealthiest civilized) nation in the
world, with the greatest inherent
power. It is logical, is it probable
that we should expect an attack?
No."
In closing his address Mr. Dunn
made a scathing denunciation of
the "pork barrel" methods of
handling war appropriations and
made a vigorous appeal for gov
ernment owned armor and muni
tions plants.
"We have spent $2,400,000,000
on our army and navy," saidl Mr.
Dunn and now those who have
spent it tell us that we have no
army or navy worth speaking
about. Before we spend $2,400,
000,000 more let's investigate
what has become of the vast sum
that has been frittered away or
has gone into the pockets of the
buccaneer armor and munitions
makers."

WILL LECTURE
SATURDAY NIGHT
Col. O. O. Shields, The Bird and
Animal Man, at the Indian
Softool at 8 P. M.
EVERYBODY IS INVITED
Noted Lecturer and Author and
Has Leotured In All the Big
Colleges In the U. S.
Early in life, Mr. Shields be
came interested in the study of
wild things and has pursued that
line of thought and investigation
ever since. He has hunted success
fully every kind of game on this
Continent, south of the Arctic
Circle, with gun and camera, but
lie quit killing years ago, when
game began to grow scarce. Since
that time he has hunted exten
sively with camera, field glass and
note book, and has stored up a
great fund of knowledge of the
habits of wild animals and1 birds.
He established Recreation maga
zine in 1894 and built it to a cir
culation of 65,000 copies, the
largest ever enjoyed by any
sportsman's publication in this
country. He organized the League
of American Sportsmen in 1898,
built it to a membership of over
12,000 and has been president of
it from the '|iy of its inception to
date.
Mr. Shields evolved the idea of
the Camp Fire Club of America
in 1897, called together about 50
men of his own kind, held month
ly meetings, and for six years did
all the work of that, organization,
which is now one of the greatest
and most important game protec
tive organizations in America.
He has written seven books oa
outdoor subjects, all of which
have had large sales, and one of
which, "Hunting in the Great
West" has sold over 200,000 co
pies.
He served in the Civil War, was
in l.'f hard fought battles and
once, on a. scouting expedition,
narrowly escaped cap|ur.e by
Mosby's guerrillas. He is a woods
man and a mountaineer of ripu
experience and in case traveled
eight months in the Mucky Moun
tains, by sai-Vlle and pack horse,
entirely alone.
Forty years ago he began to
seek legislation for the preserva
tion ui' wild life and during the
past fifteen years has devoted
nearly all his time lo this work.
Through Shield's Magazine and
