NUMBER 8
Quite a crowd of enthusiastic Wood
men attended the meeting of Camp
No. 12248, last Tuesday night Regu
lar business was transacted and one
applicant was admitted, into the for
est under the care and protection or
Chas. R. Countls3, Escort, pro tern
With initiations at every meeting
the interest and attendance Is In
creasing, and prospects are bright)
- for the continuance of the good work.
Word received from Deputy E. B
Duke, at Livingston, states that he
has ' secured a good number of ap
plications and that a class adoption
will be "pulled off" there soon.
Listen a few moments while the
great Commoner, William J. Bryan,
one of the million members of the
M. W. A. speaks:
"I have been with this organiza
tion as a member from the beglnn-
- ing; I have watched its growth; and
I regard it today as probably the
greatest single factor In the work of
bringing the world together in the
bonds of fraternity.
I am proud of my membership In
this Order. I am. grateful to those
who taught me the Importance of
the Order, who brought me within
its influence. If my connection with
it can be instrumental in bringing
, anyone else to enjoy its benefits and
to catch the inspiration that comes
through association with its mem
bers, I feel that I am only paying
back a small part of debt I owe and
rendering a real service to anyone
whom I may be able to induce to
join with us and take part In this
Order.
I have watched the growth of the
Order in its magnificent progress,
and I have been delighted in the
moral lessons that have been incul
cated in the Camp among the mem
bers. I believe that the spirit of
this Order has given it great strength
for its neighborly spirit is derived
from one of the most beautiful as
well as one of the most helpful of
the parables of Holy Writ. The les
son that we learn of the ne'ghbor
and of the neighbor's duty to those
who are in distress is a lesson that
sink3 Into tho heart or those before
whom it Is presented, and a lesson
that bears fruit in the lives of those
who hare assumed the relations of
neighbor."
MRS. LOU BAKER
On Feb. 2, 1916, death came to th?
home of W. R. Baker, in White coun
ty, and claimed his beloved wlfe.Mrs.
Lou Baker, aged 47 years.
Mrs. Baker was converted in early
youth, joined the Cumberland Pres
byterian church and lived a consist
ent member. She leaves a husband,
two children and a large circle of
relatives and friends, whose loss is
her 'gain, as those wno knew her
were impressed with the ract that
she lived a pure- Christian life.
By the death of father and mother
she was left an orphan when a little
girl. She was as a guiding star to
the other children, full of. kindnes3,
sympathy and love, and the lie that
was characteristic of the child was
still the same of the woman. She was
always unselfish, thoughtful - of the
comforts of others, thereby contrib
uting to the happiness of all around
her. She said, "Don't grieve for m
when I am gone. I have put all on
the Cross and God will take care of
me."
It Is true that our hearts are made
sadby the thought that we. can see
her face with the peaceful expres
sion and hear her sweet voice hero
no more,' yet ''our light a,fflictlou
which is but for a season worketh
for us a far more exceeding weight
of glory for in due season we shall
reap ( if we faint not." And we too
can reap the' reward she -Is now en
joying.;;' ' ,
"There Is no death to those
Who serve Him as they should.
They pass from earth and Its foes-
To be at home with God.
"Jesus, thou Prince of Life!
- Thy chosen can not die;
Like thee, they conquer In the strife,
To reign with thee on hgh."
