JURIST
Mass. Mao Speaks at College on"'Netds
of Hour," Dealing With Commercial,
Political, Domestic and Reli
gious Problems
The lecture by Judge Alden at the
Oklahoma College for "Women, last
night was an instructive and an enter
taining one. The speaker was thor
oughly conversant with his subpect,
"The Needs of the Hour," and, in ad
dition to being an elouquent and a con
vincing speaker, he had a fiue flow of
l'umor.
Judge Alden stated in tho beginning
that it would lake him over an hour tu
explain tho "needs of the hour.' And
it did. He spoke for one hour and a
half, but lie spoke in such an interest
ing and entertaining manner that nono
who heard seemed to realize the flight
of time. ,
Following his introductory remarks,
Judge Alden outlined his discourse,
dividing his subjects into four heads
the commercial, the political, tho do
mestic and the religious relations.
Tho speaker referred to tho com
mercial dishonestly and to the political
rottenness of the day. He stated that
both these emanated directly from, that
spark of "graft" which will be found
slumbering in every human breast; ho
said that tht;s grafting spirit had no
particular place of abode; that ii

years afo; the hats of today will sit
beside the "poke bonnets" of anti-bil-lum
days; the gentlemen's styles of

In addition to the preliminary steps
in the style show matter, all merchants

to immediately put. on a "membership

GERARD TO
GET INTO
CAMPAIGN
Hinted that Ambassador to Germany May
Make Speaking Tour in Support of
Wilson if Submarine Issue
is Raised
By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
BERLIN, Feb. 24. Ambassador Ge
rard, it is strongly hinted, may make
a speaking tour of America in sup
port of Wilson's candidacy for the pres
idency if the Republicans make the ad
ministration's submarine policies the
chief target of attack. He plans to
visit the "United States before the na
tional Democratic convention is held
The ambassador is convalescing from
the injuries which he received while
skiing near Munich. Persons close
to him say he will urge the necessity
for a strong tariff plank in tho Demo
cratic platform, being convinced that
Europe is preparing to flood America
with cheap products after the war, to
the detriment of American industries
He also favors a tariff commission if
circumstances permit it.
It is believed that Gerard can give
the public some interesting sidelights
on the submarine controversies. While
he was trying to impress German offi
cials with the seriousness of the sit
uation, Ambassador Dumba was in
forming Austria that Secretary Bryan
had assured him that the United States
never meant to take strong action
and Austria was passing this informa
tion on to Berlin.
To add to the complications, it is re
ported, an Illinois politician, carrying
credentials from Bryan, arrived in Ber
lin and assured high officials that
Wilson was writing notes merely for
"home consumption." It is believed
that what Gerard thought about these
moves was communicated to Colonel
House.

Chickasha, like Al Jennings and P.i!l
Dalton and Frank and Jesse James and

But Chickasha, unlike any of the

In a quiet and peaceful manner,

Chickasha is now in the spot light.
Without further circumlocution,
Chickasha now has a full-grown, fully

And this club has sprung into life
with a membership of good fellow?,

The club ha3 a set of rule "and reg

gatronomio artist in Chickasha in the
entire state of Oklahoma, for that mat

rules and regulations, the secretary
of the club will be flooded with sppli
