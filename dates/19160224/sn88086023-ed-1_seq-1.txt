Because the Indians of the i'mu

under the Jurisdiction of the
county conn, the Commercial asso
ciation will take the matter up with
the bureau of Indian affairs directly.
This was decided upon at the spec al
meeting last evening at the request
of farmers Interested In having th
county do work on the road.

as a whole refused to sanction it.
The objections of the Indians are
that they are amply able to look after
their own roads and that the county
b.is not spent much money on the
reservation roads already under their
Jurisdiction. The farmers contend
that the Indians themselves do but
little work upon their roads, leaving
them to the white renters.
Supt. Swartzlander has recommen
ded the transfer of the road to the
Indian department and has pointed
out the advantages of such a trans
fer. The Commercial association will
also emphasize the need of having the

The Blewett harvester has been
built in Spokane for the past six
years. For five years It was manu
factured by the Northwest Harvester
Co., a subsidiary of the Holt company,
and A. R. Blewett was the manager o
the company. Last year the machine!
was built in Spokane by the Blewetts
acting on an independent basis. All
told there are 160 Blewett harvesters
In use and of this number 37 are own-1
ed in Umatilla county, six
of that
number having been sold here last
year. The harvester Is highly praised
as a practical and successful machine.
