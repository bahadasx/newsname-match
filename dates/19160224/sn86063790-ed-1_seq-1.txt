nounced that it had awarded the contract
for refunding the Brown consol
debt of the State to a syndicate composed
of Townsend, Scott & Son, of
Baltimore; Stacy & Draugn, of New
York, and the Palmetto National <
Bank, of Columbia. This bid was for ;
the entire outstanding issue of Brown
consol bonds amounting to $4,800,000,
at par, with accrued interest to ]
date, and a premium of $20,016. \
There were about fifteen bids, but ,
4
this was the most favorable one and
it secured the issue.
The sinking fund commission opened
bids at noon today and was in ses- '
sion all the afternoon and until late
tonight, going carefully over each
bid. The successful bid is considered
i most advantageous oi\e in every re- 1
spect. ]
Big Interest Saving.
The bonds are refunded under an 5
ict passed by the legislature in 1912.
rhe new bonds will bear interest at <
the rate of 4 per cent, annually in- <
stead of 4 1-2 per cent., which rate *
the Brown consols carried. This will <
mean a saving of $25,000 a year in 1
interest alone and under the terms of j
the bid, which secured the bonds, in-1 ]
merest will be paid from 1912. I
The sinking fund commission is i
composed of Governor Manning, At- <

irer Carter, Comptroller General ]
Sawyer, Chairman Liles, of the house
svays and means . committee/ and |
Chairman Christensen, of the senate (

Questions Coast Fort Plans. <
Washington, Feb. 19.?Represen- 1
:ative Byrnes today had up with the 1
jhief of the coast artillery the plans 1
)f the war department as to Fort <
Premont, near Beaufort, where gunB 1
ire now placed with no men to man 1
hem. He stated that while he is in- <
termed that the officer in charge of s
hat division recommended making
Port Fremont the left flank of the ]
lefenses of Savannah the board in s
iVashington does not recommend the j
mprovement of any of the defenses ]
ilong the South Atlantic coast. Some 1
)fficiais in the department entertain j
;he idea that no enemy would attack <
ilong the Southern coast, preferring j
;o attack the North Atlantic coast j
vhere there is located much wealth
ind population, and their idea is to
?lan for the defense of Southern
ports only by movable guns mat can :
Pe transported from place to place.
Mr. Byrnes takes the position that
iefense is a national and not a local
issue and if the board believes im- (
provement of Southern defenses not ]
essential he only wants their reasons <
for this belief, and why it is essential \
to improve only the forts along the ]
Sforth Atlantic coast. The chief of i
staff has not yet informed him of ]

Spirited Fight on Measure Requiring
Cotton Mills to Pay Every Week.
Columbia, Feb. 19.?The bill requiring
textile plants to have weekly
pay days for operatives caused a
spirited fight in the senate this morn
ing. The bill originally included
lumber mills also, but those pushing
the measure agreed to eliminate the
lumber mills on free conference and
have it apply only to cotton mills.
Senators Carlisle, John F. Williams
and Earle led the fight for the bill,
while Senator DuRant piloted the onslaught
on the measure and used
every effort to kill it. On the motion
to drop the enacting words the
vote was 15 to 21, and the opponents
Df the bill then tried to emasculate it
by exempting certain counties, but
this was also defeated.
Peurifoy Elected Judge.
Columbia, Feb. 17.?The legislature
today elected James E. Peurifoy
3ircuit judge of the newly created
circuit. He received the vote of 96
members of the general assembly,
while Mr. W. B. Gruber received 58
rotes. The minority vote was from
members who were outside of the
lew circuit, the entire list of coun:ies
in the new circuit having voted
tor and supported Mr. Peurifoy.
The newly elected judge is a Citaiel
graduate, is about 42 years of
ige, has served the State as senator
trom his county, and has been emilentlv
successful in his business aftairs
at Walterboro, and has quite a
reputation as a lawyer. Mr. Peuritoy

LIKELY TO BE HELD UP.
Doubt About Bill Appropriating
$100,000 for Asylum.
Columbia, Feb. 22.?Doubt as to
the legality of the item in the ap
propriation bill of $100,000 for repairs
at the State Hospital for the
Insane caused Comptroller General
Sawyer to refer the matter to Attorney
General Peeples for an opinion.
The attorney general says that he
does not think that the appropriation
of $100,000 for repairs at the Asylum
is appropriated because the language
of the bill is doubtful. On
this account the attorney general advises
that he cannot say that this appropriation
is legal.
Because of this fact the Comptroller
general will not pay out this
$100,000 except on orders from the
court, and it, therefore, seems that
somebody is to blame for another big
error, all probably due to the rush of
ramming through matters in an allnight
session. It was intended that
the appropriation bill should carry
$100,000 for repairs at the Asylum
and authority for the governor to
borrow an additional $50,000 if
necessary. However, the courts will
have to pass on this matter before
the comptroller general will pay any
of it out.
Just what the effect of holding up
all improvements at the Asylum will
be remains to be seen.
NINE MEET DEATH.
Disregard of Cautionary Signal Probably
Cause of Accident.
Milford, Conn., Feb. 22.?Disregard
of a cautionarysignal probably
was responsible for the rear end collision
on the New York, New Haven
and Hartford railroad near here today,
in which nine persons were killed
and fifty injured, according to
Charles C. Elwell, of the Connecticut
public utilities commission. A State
investigation is under way but as
four railroad employees, the most
important witnesses, were killed, it
will be difficult to fix responsibility,
Mr. Elwell said.
"Two passengers, a man and a woman,
were- killed instantly when a
local train running forty miles an
hour crashed into the rear of the
Greenfield Express, which was stalled
by a broken air hose. Two other
passengers died in hospitals.
The official theory of the accident
is that the local's engineer, disregarded
or failed to see the cautionary
signal and could not make his
brakes hold when he came in sight
of the danger signal.
George T. Tourtellette, a flagman,
sent back from the stalled train,
stood in the path of the approaching
local, frantically waving his red flag
until escape was impossible and was
killed under the engine wheels. Both
trains wer well filled with passengers.
Among the injured were several
Yale graduates returning to New
York after attending alumni day at
New Haven. On the local were several
members of the Sons of .the
American Revolution enroute to
Bridgeport to attend a dinner.
A freight train passing on another
track as the express and local collided
complicated the wreck. Shattered
coaches hurled against the box
cars derailed them and the cars of all
three trains were piled up. Passengers
were buried under heaps.

of Monday. The meat, according
to the inspector will have to go

other meats are put

in place of other meats.
Cafe men of the city say that if
the demand is sufficient, it will be
added to the regular menu cards.
Market men state that horse flesh
could be sold for between five and
ten cents a pound and that it had
been declared healthy meat by some
of the best known health students of
the country.

LAWMAKERS END SESSION
REVIEW OF THE WORK OF 1010
SESSION'.
Most of Administration Measures
Were Enacted Into Law.?Much.
Local Leidslation.
0?Columbia,
Feb. 20.?In the general
assembly, which adjourned without
debate at 5:35 o'clock this morning,
there were three features: Prohibition,
politics and passionless legislation.
Prohibition was probably predominant.
Whatever the prohibitionists
wanted they secured, and it
was altogether without what might
be called "the steam roller process."
As is expressed in politics, "they just
had the votes," and whether prohibition
is a success or a failure there
cannot be any charge that the friends
of this system of handling the liquor
traffic lacked for sympathy. The essential
accomplishments in the line
of prohibition were, first, the granting
of authority to use so much as
$50,000 for the enforcement of the
prohibition laws. Second, the making
of the violation of the laws a
chain gang offence. Third, the reduction
of the allowance for personal
consumption during any one
month from one gallon to half that
quantity. Fourth, the application of
every known and conceivable method
of prohibiting the sale, storage or
transportation of liquor, except in
two^uart quantities. * Fifth, the reenactment
of every prohibition statute
that could be found in the records
under the ratification act. The
only measure that was advocated by
n _ i. _ A 1 ~ ? 4- ^ nn/?
LI10 prom unionists iu iue senate <xuu.
which failed in the house was the
Carlisle bill, which sought to prohibit
newspapers from advertising liquors
in South Carolina, and then
the house insisted and secured a
more liberal allowance of real beer
for personal consumption under the
two-quart a month statute.
Status of Prohibition.
Prohibition is a political as well
as an economic issue in this State. It
is regarded today as extremely popular
in South Carolina. It is a political
balloon at this time, and is going
to be used during the coming summer
for all it is worth. Then the 2cent
rate bill, which died in the senate,
was another of the several campaign
propositions utilized on the
house side.
Perhaps the most distinguished
feature of this session of the general
assembly was the utter lack of passion.
In by-gone days the line of
demarcation between Tillmanites and
anti-Tillmanites was very sharp.
Then came the line between the dispensary.
and anti-dispensary advocates,
and more recently the advocacy
of Blease and his policies was
an acute issue. Once or twice there
was a slight symptom of an effort to
inject partisan politics, but it was a
complete failure, and there is nothing
that was done at this session of the
general assembly that bears any of
the ear marks of partisanship.
Quite true, policies that were advocated
by Governor Manning were
accepted, but they were accepted on
their merits, rather than as political
factors, and in most cases, such as on
the conciliation bill, there was entire
unanimity. In other cases, as on the
workingmen's compensation act, urged
and advocated by the governor,
there was entire failure, and it was
not even brought up for discussion.
Completion of Plans.
Most of the work accomplished at
Al-:~ ?nfV>rtr? in tlio nafnrfl
II11S StJSSiUIi was laiuci m uui.u>v
vof completing last year's constructive
undertakings; that is, the tax commission
law now in effect was
strengthened in the opinion of its
friends by a provision for a board of
review, which is to act as a supreme
court in matters of taxation. Then
the Torrens system, which passed the
house last year, was enacted into
lav/. This system for the present is
made optional, but it is thought that
it will be so appealing to people that
they will voluntarily accept the protection
and economy that the system
is expected to afford. The McCullough
child labor legislation, also advocated
by Governor Manning, was
also enacted into law. This is a
striking illustration of how much can
ho Qnirt in a few words. The entire
act consists of exactly twenty-five
words, and reads:
"No child under the age of 14
years shall be employed in any factory,
mine or textile establishment
of this State after January 1, 1917."
There was no need to say more.
Another suggestion of Governor
Manning's that will be studied from
a legislative standpoint is how rural
credits might be introduced to ad
>
J
vantage in this State. There were
several propositions offered, all of
them having merit, but too detailed
to be absorbed and the general assembly
appointed a commission to
make a careful study of the situation
and if in the meanwhile something
practical can be worked out and the
people can be educated to the possibilities
of the rural credits system, a
beginning might be made at the next
session of the general assembly as a
result of the present agitation.
Another Forward Step.
Another step forward was made in
the extension of support for the rural
graded school by taking into the Told
schools in the towns and cities that
j
consent to accept children as pupils
from the rural districts. An appropriation
of $120,000 is carried this
year for the purpose of subsidizing
these schools.
*
There can be no question of the
hold that the State warehouse sys- .
tem had upon the members of the
general assembly. Whatever Commissioner
McLaurin asked for was
granted. Whether this be a tribute
to Mr. McLaurin, as an individual, or
whether it is to his administration as
warehouse commissioner, or to the
system itself and its possibilities, remains
to be developed. One thing
is certain, and that is that the warehousfe
system has a Gotch hold on the
political situation in this State today.
,::' %
One of the essential constructive
measures that failed looked towards
the establishment of a State highway ?
commission, or some other method of
harmonizing and developing the road
building of this State. The majority
of the members apparently favored
some State system, but they could
not agree uporii any one method of
handling this situation, were afraid
i of the name "commission," and had ..
j to encounter the desire of each coun
ty to hold the revenue rrom tne B?oposed
automobile license and thereby
for the time being a State-wide sysA
x ^
tern failed. This will come in time.
Constitutional amendments had
rough skating, and all of them fell
down the first time they tried to roll
around. There were three proposed
' amendments to the fundamental law
of State-wide importance: First, the
one looking to woman suffrage; second,
one looking towards biennial , , /
sessions, and, third, the Wolfe proposition,
which contemplates the granting
of divorces under certain conditions.
Neither of these three ideas
i got by first base.
One of the measures that excited
considerable debate and in which
there was the only suggestion of a
filibuster, was on the bill which excommunicates
the Southeastern Tariff
association from South Carolina.
; This action, it is suggested, is a se'
quel to the contention of the warehouse
commissioner on the matter of
. fire insurance rates. This, added to
i the alleged arbitrariness of the ratemaking
bureau, persuaded the ma- ^
jority of the legislators to chase theTariff
association out of the State,
I *" ~ " ~ ^ ^
and South Carolina is for a second
i
: time going to try some method of
handling fire insurance rates without
a central rate-making bureau in this
State. Under the terms of the act as j
! amended in the house the insurance
commissioner is given the right to
! review all fire insurance rates, sub;
ject to summary court review; mill
1 mutuals and the factory insurance
! association are exempted; and it is
| provided that nothing contained in
the act shall be held to interfere with ^ ^
any insurance placed by or through
the warehouse commissioner.
There was keen interest in the liaj
bility bill, which, after an intense
j contest, was approved. Under the
i provisions of this act as passed, what
is known as the doctrine of contributory
negligence as applied to railroad
employees was abandoned, and to a
| large extent the federal statute with
j reference to railroad liability was accepted
as the statute law of South
Carolina. The opponents of the bill
secured an amendment by which it
was made plain that the damages to
be collected should not include what
is known as punitive damages.
At the outset of the session, it
looked as if the counties that were
not clever enough to dispose of all
of their liquor by the first of January
last were going to be left with
souvenirs. Some of the prohibition
j leaders began to urge that the coun
| ties that had not soia meir uquur
were to blame and that if they lost
that they would have to censura the
county boards and not the general assembly.
One by one the counties secured
the consent or' the house to
the adoption of bills which allowed
the individual counties to dispose of
their stocks of unsold liquors outside
of the State. This might have been
