q
Allthough "Itobln Hood'"' la twenty,
thrco years old, and Iteglnald Do
Koven has wrltcn many othor works,
this is tho flrstjlmo that ho has lent
his namo to any company presenting
his oporas. Tho Do Koven Opera
Company, composed mostly of Grand
Opora singers and hcadod by Ivy
V Scott of tho Metropolitan Grand
Opera, Now York, will bo heard nt
tho Lyric, Thursday night March 2,
and, radical ag It inny seem, Mr. Do
Koven Is authority1 for tho statomont
that the vocal balance and calibre of
tho present company, suits him oven
better than did tho original Boston
Inns. This Is explained by tho fact
that In thoso days thoro was a certain
amount of catorlng to tho comedians
of tho organization, and now, whllo
tho comedy rolos nro not noglcctod,
tta music is sung by singers possess
ing voices suited to tho Bcoro, who
wero carefully selected from tho
Brand opera houses of this country

AGGIES TAKE
CRIMSON BOYS
INTO CAMP
Tho Aggie basketball team took tho
Crimson 'crowd Into camp Tuesday
night In tho final witulup gamo be
tween tho two local colleges, tho
scoro being 2M8 In favor of tho far
mer boys. Tho gamo was one of
the closest contests that wo hnvo had
In basketball this season. Tho first
half resulted, In a scoro of 9-S In fa
vor of Jensen's quintet. At tho be
ginning of tho second half tho Ag
gies came back fetrong and beforo tho
B. Y. boys got their breath, Kapple
had safely landed two field baskets,
Smith two nnd Johnson pno. With
such a handicap bb this it was hard
for the Crimson boys to recover, al
though Williams mado a spurt in the
last few minutes of play hooping two
baskets from tho field and Wright se
cured another, but tho gun came too
soon to .allow the Crimsons to over
take tho lead of tho Agglca oven if
they had the ability to do so.
Tho first half was a "tack on"
gamo. Tho Aggies wero out to see
that no B. Y. men scored from tho
field and tho B. Y. boys were equaU
ly determined that tho Aggies would
not scoro and as a result thoro wero
thrco field baskets mado In tho first
half, ono by Wright and ono by Neol
ey for tho Crimsons nnd ono by
Johnson fortho Aggies. Johnson
scored flvo goals from tho foul lino
In tho first half and two In tho sec
ond half securing as many field bas
kets as any man on either team and
coming within ono point of having
as high a scoro as Wright for tho
B. Y. C, who scored twelvo points
out of tho eighteen for his team.
Tho Smart gymnasium was pack
ed with as enthusiastic a crowd as
over gathered to seo tho local teams
fight for supremacy. Tho soason
closes giving tho first victory to tho
B. Y. C. and tho second victory to
tho Aggies. This bolng tho caso ev
erybody should bo satisfied as tho
honors brako oven.
Tommy Fltzpatrlck who rcforeed
tho gamo handled tho situation in a
way that fiavo universal satisfaction.

MOTIVES MAY BE
MISCONSTRUED
It Is said that Sheriff John H. Bar
ker Is In training to succeed tho pros
ent county treasurer, and that Asses
or John B. Woodward, Is In training
to succeed tho present county sheriff.
Whllo wo don't enro to take tho po
sition that the" abovo Is tho enso, as
neither of tho abovo gentlemen havo
mado their announcement, wo havo
boon reliably Informed that tho as
sessor and the sheriff nro very closo
companions of lato In tho matter of
rounding up tho property of certntn
taxpnyorji. It may bo that It Is
thought advlsablo to havo a body
guard In visiting certain Individuals
during theso times of aggltatlon of
taxes "too high," If this Is tho caso,
It would bo unjust to suggest that n
switch of official positions is con
templated In tho fall olectlon. It can
bo seen, howovcr, Just bow tho mo
tives of theso gentlemen could bo
misconstrued as they have both serv
ed Cacho county two terms In their
present positions and they may not
deem a third term ndvlsablo.
