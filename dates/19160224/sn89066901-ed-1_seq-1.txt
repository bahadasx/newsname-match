Mining News
The work being done in the
neighborhood of the Dodson
Mining Co. is progressing under
the direction of Mr. Dolby, of
Stillwell, Okla., and J. C. Thorn
ton, of Joplin. The visit of the
remainder of this new company
was postponed until a later date,
but the work will continue, as
these properties are "showiDg
up" the deeper they go.
Silicate is found from the grass
roots to 40 feet in depth, and any
farmer boy with a pick and shov
el, if he finds the right spot, can
dig out at that depth a ton of
this ore in a week, which is
worth $85 a ton.
J. M. Slate arrived this week
from Vera Cruz and owns a Key
stone drilling outfit, and is look
ing over the mining field in the
vicinity of Mansfield. Mr. Slate
has had several years of mining
experience, and hopes to be a-
mong the prospectors here in
the near future.
The property known as the
Sammy-Bly" mine is being
worked by Sam Ervin and Chas.
Bly. Mr. Irwin worked for the
Dodson Mining Co. several years
ago, also speut a year in the Au
rora mines, and his experiences
lead him to believe that they
have as good a prospect at the
depth of 18 feet as any in the
field. Lead in paying quantities
at the present price of ore is the
present prospect, with some
jack in sight.
W. H. Utchman, six miles
southwest of Mansfield, has per
haps the finest specimens of ore
at the present writing. At a
depth of 18 feet this shaft shows
a rich vein of lead, a specimen of
which can be seen at W. B.
Hitchcock's real estate office. -
Hugh Williams, in prospecting
at a depth of 8 feet, has a fine
outlook for what is known as a
two o'clock fissure". He in
tends to continue activities.
We desire to start a mineral
display in the Mirror office win
dow and will give space for all
specimens brought in. Each
will be labeled with the name, of
the mineral, the mine from which
it was taken, and the name of the
owuer or operator.
Mayor Riley,
Dear Sir: I want to be able
to make Mansfield soon to look
over j our mining properties, and
the country in general. , I thank
you for your kind effer. Please
send me another copy of the
Mansfield Mirror.
Respectfully,

sides three cars of cattle they

20 Per Cent Guaranteed
This investment will make you
rich. Read every line.
Omaha, Nebraska.
My Dear Sir::
Knowing that you are always
interested in and open for invest
ment in a good, live business
proposition, I take the liberty of
presenting to you herewith what
seems to me to be a most won
derful business, and in which no
doubt you will take a lively inter
est and perhaps some stock.
The object of the Company is
to operate a large cat ranch some
place in the Ozarks where land
can be purchased cheap for the
purpose.
We propose to start the ranch
with One Hundred Thousand
cats. Each cat will average 12
kittens a year. The skins with
out the meows, sell for 10 cents
each for the pure white ones and
75 cents for the pure blacks.
This will give us Twelve Million
skins a year to sell, at an aver
age cost of 30 cents apiece, mak
ing our revenue about $iu,uuo
per day gros3.
A man ought to skin at least
fifty cats a day. At 5 cents
each, this would amount to $2.50
each, or a total outlay of $250.00
per day, as we figure that it will
take about One Hundred men
to operate the ranch, therefore
our net profit will be &9.750 a
day. As the above would be
practically the only expense we
would have, as we propose start
ing a rat ranch next door to feed
the cats, and as rats multiply
four times as fast as cats, if we
start with One Million rats, we
will ha?e four rats per day for
each cat, which with the tea
will get from the cat-nips will
be plenty.
Then we will feed the rats on
the carcasses of the cats, from
which the skins have been taken,
giving each rat one fourth of a
cat, which experts claim is plen
ty for anything but wharf rats.
When it is understood that
these cats have what no other
animal has kittens it will be
seen that the buness will be
self acting, automatic, and con
sequently profitable from the
start, as the cats will eat the
rats and the rats will eat the
cats, and we will get the skins.
Awaiting your early reply, and
trusting you will appreciate this
opportunity to get rich quickly,
I am, Yours very truly,
W. A. F.
P. P. While the above is a
good READING investment, we
could not recommend it for your
wife and children. The best
possible investment for them is
a policy in the Woodmen of the
World. For particulars see -C.
M. SEAL, Clerk.

Obituary
Mrs. Mary Ann Night, daugh
ter of Hiram Rippee and wife,
was born in Indiana Feb.S5,1631.
She moved with her parents to
Wright county,Mo,,in June,' 1937.
She married James Night March.
21, 1850, in Wright county. To
this union were born five child
ren, four Joys and one girl. One
boy is dead. Sister flight de-.
Darted this life from her home
in MansSold Feb. 14, 1916, at 3 a.
m. If she had lived uutil the
25th she would have been 85
years pld; in March she would
have been married 66 years. She
had been a Christian 70 years.
At the age of 15 she became reli
gious and joined the Methodist
church and was a member of it
for about three years; about 30
years since she joined the Cum
berland Presbyterians and was a
faithful member until she cross
ed the river of death. Out of 11
brothers and sisters, she is sur
vived by one brother, Thomas J. .
Rippee, She is also survived by
her dear husband and four child
renJohn Wesley Might of Po
mona, H. J. and W. H. Might and
Mrs. Mary J. King of Mansfield.
Aunt Ann was above an average
Christian. She stood for the
the right under all conditions.
She was faithful to her church
with her money, attendance and
prayers. Her life as a Christian
was as a shining light; as a wife .
and mother, true aud atfection
ate. For some years past she has
been in declining health and dur
ing all these years she said she
was ready to go. "Ail is well; I
am just waiting; nothing bothers
me; I have no fears; let the will
of the Lord be done." A good
neighbor, Christian, mother and
wife has gone; -it makes earth
poorer and heaven richer. As
sisted by Revs. J. M. England
and Joseph Davis, the writer
conducted the funeral service
from her home, after which the
body was laid to rest in the
Mansfield cemetery. All of the
relatives have my prayers and
best wishes. J. A. RUSSELL.
James Cameron, aged 52 years,

Frank Scheuermann place; inter
ment at 4 p, m. today it Douglas
