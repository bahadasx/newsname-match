METHODIST
Sunday was another great da
with us; we had 199 inS.S. and
counting Dr. Linn ther: were just
200 present. The Bible Class was
at high ti le. 43 men present
and other classes were largely at
tended. Then following the S. S. a
large audience gathered for the
morning wor.-hip. The male ciiar
tette rendered one of its choicest
selections: "When the Mist's II l ve
Rolled away," and it was as fine a
selection as the men have offered.
Then Dr. Linn preached an hour on
the 23d Psalm, and lie gave us a
message that we seldom he ir in a
town of this size. I am sure the
message will be long remembered
by those who heard it. The people
here are proud of Dr. Linn, and
well might they be, for he is not
au ordinary man. by uny means.
He occupies a prominent place in
the educational world, and if he
lives he is not thro growing; he will
reach a larger field than that he
occupies at present
Next Sunday morning I want to
continue the theme I started two
Sundays ago, and if it is a nice day.
I hope there may be a large con
gregation at the m irning worship)
