WHY PRINCE
ALBERT WINS.
Patented Process Is Responsi
ble for Its International
Popularity.
Smokers so much appreciate
the flavorand coolness and aroma
of Prince Albert pipe and cigar
ette tobacco that they often
marvel that this one brand could
be so different from all others.
The answer to this question is
to be found on the reverse side of
every Prince Albert package,
where you will read: "Process
Patented July 30th, 1907. ' ' That
tells the whole story. Prince
Albert is made by a patented pro
cess that cuts out the bite and
parch, which makes the tobacco
so mighty agreeable and satisfy
ing to men of every taste of every
civilized nation on the globe.
Smokers should , realize that
this patented process cost three
years' continuous work and study
and a fortune in money to perfect
But the result has proven to be
worth all that was expended upon
it because it has set free men who
believe they never could enjoy a
pipe or a makin's cigarette.
Prince Albert makes it possible
for every man to smoke a pipe or
to roll his own cigafette. And,
no matter how tender the tongue
Prince Albert cannot bite or
parch. That is cut out by the
patented prdcess leaving' for the
smoker only the joys the fragrant
tobacco.
It is a fact that since Prince
Albert "arrived," just about six
years, ago; it has made three men
smoke pipes where one smoked a
pipe before!
Dr. Bouldin has been in Hol
brook this week he returned
last night while there he pur
