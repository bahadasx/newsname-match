trict in the French war zone, but
within the last few days the attacks
of the Germans have taken on a.lded
strength. The battle line has been
extended and now reaches from Mai

Preparedness Will Be Discussed
With Admiral Badger in Ex

Washington, Feb. 23.—Internation­
al consideration which moved the
naval general board to change its
time honored policy last year, and
declare that the United States navy
should equal the largest afloat by
not later than. 1925, will be disclosed
to the house naval committee tomor­
row in executive session, by Rear
Admiral Charles J. Badger, a mem­
ber of the board, the admiral consist­
ently refusing to discuss, except be­
hind closed doors, the board's views
of the danger that may confront the
nation.
The subject came up when Repre­
sentative Stephens of California,
seeking to show that Pacific coast
was inadequately defended, asked if
the board in altering its policy did
not have in mind the possibility that
the country might have to face sim­
ultaneously enemies in the Pacific
and Atlantic oceans. Admiral Bad­
ger said he could answer that only
in executive session.
He explained, however, that a fleet
capable of dominating the Pacific
ocean was the only sure protection
for the Pacific coast, and said the
earth slides in the Panama canal
had made impossible for the present,
and possibly for another year, the
use of the fleet in either ocean. Fur­
ther discussion of the canal closure
also was deferred to the closed ses­
sion.

ZEPPELIN WHS A
VIVIDJPICTURE
Eye Witness Tells How French
Troops Brought Down Big
Dirigible.
INCENDIARY BOMBS
SET ZEPPELIN AFIRE
Lookout Heard Sound of Propel
lers and Sounded a General
Alarm.
Paris, Feb. 23.—An eye-witness of
the destruction of Zeppelin L-277 by
French gunners on Monday near
Revigny, a town nine miles north­
west of Bar-le-Luc, thus describes
the exploit:
"Two Zeppelins were signalled at
10:25 o'clock at night by an artil­
lery officer in a listening post in the
first line trenches of the Argonne.
The night was clear and the wind
moderate. The officer could not see
the airships, but he heard the noise
of their engines and telephoned to
the battery base, whence the news
was forwarded to the army corps
headquarters. All the batteries of
the district were at once on the alert
and within five minutes searchlights
were sweeping the heavens in all di­
rections.
"The Zeppelins were first sighted
6y an officer commanding a battery
of 75 millimetre guns. The nearest
was then about two miles off, flying
at an altitude of about 5,000 feet and
rising rapidly. The second Zeppelin
was some three miles behind the
first. The officer was unable to get
the elevation necessary to hit the air­
ship, but he managed to give the ex­
act position to the searchlight oper­
ators. From that moment until it
was destroyed the first dirigible was
never lost to view and the search­
lights never left it. IAS it was mov­
ing against the wind its progress
was relatively slow.
Incendiary Shells.
"As soon as the warning reached
Revigny, five automobiles, with
searchlights and with special anti­
aircraft guns manned by naval gun­
ners, started in pursuit. These guns
throw a shell which is expressly de­
signed to explode on contact with
the aluminum-plaited covering of the
Zeppelins and to burst into flames
once it is inside. As the car rushes
along the road, the officer standing
in the back of the. car, gives' the
range and directs the flre of the gun
by the crew which work the gun ly­
ing 011 the flat of their backs.
"The guns on the moving automo
bils opened fire as soon as they
come within range. A shell burst
just behind the Zeppelin, throwing
it into strong relief, and immediately
the gunners seized their opportunity.
Another shell passed over the target,
but the next of the inflammable type
hit the mark squarely about 75 feet
from the stern.
"There was a shout of triumph
from the Frenchmen as the shell ap­
peared to go through the body of the
airship and to adhere to the right
side of the framework, which it Bet
afire. A few seconds later two oth­
er shells went through the rear of
the car, badly damaged the steering
gear and elevating mechanism.
Ship Takes Fire.
"For an instant nothing seemed to
happen and then a thin red line
crept along the side of the airship,
which shone with a bright, ruddy
glow as the flames spread and mov­
ed upwards. No explosion was heard
as the Zeppelin began to fall. The
great mass, now blazing more and
more fiercely, descended slowly,
while burning fragments of the cov­
er fluttered away in the wind, and
all the onlookers expressed surprise
that the airship to'dk so long to come
down.
"The cargo of bombs, which there
is reason to believe were to have
been dropped on the inhabitants of
Paris, exploded with a terrific roar
as the Zeppelin struck the ground.
Fragments of its car were hurled
over 2,000 feet away and the reman
der of the huge framework collapsed
in a heap, the fire continuing to burn
for several hours.
"The second Zeppelin, which had
witnessed the disaster to its compan­
ion, turned tail and hurried back to
the German lines.
"It is believed that the Zeppelin
belonged to the crown prince's army.
The commanders had hoped to steal
across the French lines unperceived,
all lights in the gondolas having
been extinguished, but the head wind
proved an obstacle to the speed
which is so essential to the success

Rockford, who has enlisted with Bis­

no valid reason has been advancec
for changing the seat of government.
Rev. Mahin is a. retired minister
and come to this state thirty years

torial delegates to Yankton, when
the capital removal to Bismarck was
an issue. He remembers well how
this city, just a frontier village then,
raised $100,000 and donated 360
acres for territorial capital purposes.
He represents the pioneers of the
state who remember the famous
Yankton fight and what Bismarck
did then.
Citizens of Bismarck should at­

The Milwaukee City boosters, be­
cause they realize that once again
Milwaukee is made famous because
of its beer, when the total output of
all Milwaukees breweries entitles
beer to only seventh rank in the list
of Milwaukee manufacturers.
The Anti-Saloon League, because
they think Cary is Joking them.
Police Chief Janssen, because he
has just succeeded in closing the
cabarets, and making the town mor­
al by driving out the red lights, and
fears he will be blamed for making
the town too tame for a nation's
capital, if Cary's bill loses.
The conservative Republicans, be­
cause if the nation's capital were in
Milwaukee, Senator La Follette
could do his campaigning in Wiscon­
sin and his senatorial attendance at
the same time.
But then there are many reasons
why Milwaukee could be the nation's

Senate Leaders Sharply Dissent
From President Wilson's
Stand.
PRESIDENT OPPOSES
LEGISLATIVE ACTION
Both Houses in State of Tension
Take Entire Day Over
Latest Turn.
Washington, Feb. 23.—'Agitation
in congress in favor of warning
Americans off of armed ships of Bel­
ligerents suddenly grew to such pro
portions today* that Democrats of
the foreign affairs committee voted
to canvass the sentiment of the
house on several pending resolutions
of that nature.
Sentiment in the senate in favor
of some such action was openly ex­
pressed, but at the end of a day of
surprises, tens ion. and agitation such
as has not been seen in. congress in
some time, the word came thftt. Pres­
ident Wilson still was unalterably
opposed to any such action, by con­
gress, and believed that he would
only be embarrassed thereby ia the
negotiations ~with Germany. ym-tf-.
Situation Is Grave.
The suden developments at the
capital brought surprise and appre­
hension to the administration lead*
ers. While confronted with the pos­
sibility of congressional interference
with all its grave aspects, ranging
from a defection from the adminis­
tration policy to downright ambar
rassment of the president and secre­
tary of state, the leaders were confi­
dent they would control the situa­
tion and leave the executive branch
of the government free to carry on
.diplomatic negotiations with Ger­
many.
Business Blocked.
At no time today did the question
come out openly on the floor of
cither the house or the senate, but
about a score of congressmen, who
announced they were in favor o£
'warning Americans, even if it in­
volved a repudiation of the adminis­
tration policy, if thereby they
thought war would be averted, kept
both houses in a state of tension
that practically blocked business,
May Mean War.
All the demonstration was in the
democratic ranks and there was no
open show of sentiment among the
republicans. It was indicated, how­
ever, that Republican Leader 'Mann
sympathized with 'President Wilson's
policy and that any outbreak would.
have to reckon with his force. From
apparent authentic sources came
statements tonight that the president
was determined that the dispute be
settled without prolonged negotia­
tions. He is known to believe, h«W»
ever, that the breaking off of diplo­
matic relations with Germany mean*
war, and there will be no undue haste
in handling the situation involving
such a possibility.
Developments Expected.
The administration's view is thaC
a broad and important principle is in*
volved in the rights of Americans to
travel on belligerent merchantmen,'
and that this right must not be abaa«. '.'i
doned.
Developments are expected •o*^"*
