YOUNG GIEL BEUTALLY
ASSAULTED.
J. Radford, Found Uncon
scious in Her Home
Near Deepwater.
When the seven year old son
of (h j. Radford, who lives on a
farm near Deepwater, went into
the house for dinner Saturday he
found his half sister, Ora Butler,
lying unconscious on the floor
with a handkerchief tied tightly
around her neck.
Mr. and Mrs. Radford, who re
cently moved to Deepwater from
Spruce, this county, last Thurs
day came back to Spruce for a
load of goods they had left there
when they moved, leaving Miss
Ora and three brothers to look
after the place.
Friday night prowlers were
heard about the place and Ray
mond Radford fired at them with
a giin but did uot hit any one,
Saturday morning Miss Ora tele
phoned her mother and Mr. Rad
ford not to stay away another
night as she was afraid to' stay
there without them. Saturday
morning her two older, brothers
went to Deepwater and when her
younger brother, who had been
playing' around the farm went to
the house "about 11 o'clock he
found his sister lying on the
floor. She had been struck on
the head with some blunt instru
ment and rendered unconscious.
It is supposed that .robbery was
the object of the attack as a sum,
of money had been paid her for
Mr. Radford after he left Thurs
day. This, however, she had sent
to Deepwater by her brothers.
The officers have no clue to the
perpetrators of the deed as their
victim has only partially re
gained consciousness and it is not
known whether or not she will be
able to give a description of her
assailants.
