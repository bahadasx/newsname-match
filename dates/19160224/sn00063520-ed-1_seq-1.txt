l.t'is Is uiiill Hut a hi, mil percent
age of the iall pigs now on hand are
ni.ugii to be i.n. bod for the
.March .,r April market Most of theni
.ill be llnislie.l In the early summer
and will get to the murk el when It
Is not very attraclhe In order that
the spring llitem get to the market
re the price begins to tuke Ite
.i in n in slide It Is necessary to have
1 .in coiue early and to be pushed
along rupldly with corn of the year
l. "lore lloth these factors tlie ln-
convenieiice of having pigs come In
ary or March und the lack of
corn lo IIiiIhIi them early mean that
many a farmer losen the "velvet" In
(he hog-feeding game.
About the lirst of October, whoa
hogs were selling In the local mark
et for 18.10, a young farmer asked
me what I though! about the hog
market. 1 told hltu if 1 had huge
anywhere near II 111 shell I would sell
t ln-in ut that price rather than wait,
and I worked mil my reuson on paper
und showed It to lillil ll was Home
thing like tall II" Mild dial lie had
otea aralghtag ahoal 111 pounds
He wanted to keep them sis
weeks longer und put about 60
p.. iiuds apiece on I hem hy feeding new
corn With hogs ut fS.ll) those 150-
pollllll hogs were worth tl:' '

pounds of gain would haw Beat ut
hast $J 4ii, so that for the sanie bog
Whleh he could have Hold for 12.1o
he would have realized 110.20 six
weeks later.
This is a universal practice 1'arin
ers everywhere plan lo llnlsli their
hogs with new eoru. I fail to see
Why they do not hold the Ham. com
until next aaaaaa, reed it to bogs on
pasture und have them matured be
fore Hh "new coin ' hogs get on the
market in hultlciint numbers to bear
il down
In hitting Hie right hog market,
then, two things iniisi he consider. -,
the time of farrowing and the
met hod or reeding ir pigs come early
they algal ht ted llherully to get on
the market in lalahad condition uy
Seplemher If they coiue later they
will not see a good market before
lata th" following winter. Another
disadvantage or late spring pigs Is
that the fall pigs niu.si come ag late
that they will "eat their heads oh""
I, efore spring Sows that hale pro
duced aarly larlag kitten may be
bred for aai i (all liners.
ll is hitting ihe BUrbOt when prices
are on Ihe peaks that brings the most
money, hut it take, some planning

hogs are ready whoa tha market is
