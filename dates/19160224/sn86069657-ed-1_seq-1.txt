States for the ensuing t'our'yeuts

second choices before Feb. 25,
and also compels them to secure
the consent of their candidates
to the use of their names. This

ing one of Powell county's most
prominent citizens;
Last week we mot Prof. Hanley, pre
sident of Stanton College, on tho train,
lie is a cultured gentleman in a cul
tured place ; an energetic schoolman in
a place of great opportunity. We won
der if Clark County folks ore acquaint
ed with the finq. work being done In
this neighboring institution? We
ought to know all about such good
things. Wo also wonder if they can
play ball, orate and spell? If thoy
think they .can do ay of these things
why won't they challenge Winchester
or Clark County High School?

nounced that he will he n candi
date for the Republican nomina

has been requested by numerous
friends to state whether or not he
would be a candidate, and he has
finally decided to throw his hat
in the ring.
Mr. Rogers is one of the best
known citizens of Powell county,
and would, wo believe, make a
thoroughly competent officer if
elected.

Steady Growth in
Oil Production
The Estill oil fields have shown
a steady growth since the devel
opment started some months ago,
and there is an ir.creaso in tho
in the number of wells being
sunk each month. Out of .seventy
6tx wells that have been sunk,
only spven dry holes have been
found, and while some of the
producero are not pumping more
than a few barrels a day they
show promise of better things.
The field is now being extend
ed into Powell county and a few
good wells have been sunk here
with prospects good for more
producers. A strike was mad?
at Furnace a few days ago and
nearly all the land there has been
leaped to various operators.
There are eighteen drilling
machines in the field and all are
beiim kept busy, although the
had roads have delayed the work
considerably.
In drilling for water with a
small hand drill last week, Ike
Muncie struck oil on his farm on
Black Creek, and while the
amount was not great, tho fact
that if was struck at a depth of
7 feet trom the surface, indi
cates that there in oil in the
ground.
Buys Farms
O. L. Smith, who recently sold
his farm on Black Creek to
Breathitt county parties, has pur
chased the Toler place consisting
of 50 acres, and tho II. R. Rey
nolds of 28 acres Both thee
farms are in the Pompey district,
and convenient to town. Mr.
Smith will shortly move to the
Revnolds pro perty, where he will
make his home.
Mall Contracts Let
John Burton has been awarded
the contract for carrytne the
mail from Clay City to Vaughn's
Mill and Union Hall. Mr. Thac
has had this route for the past
fcur years. J. Snowdeu has the
