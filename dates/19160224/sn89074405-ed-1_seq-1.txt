REMAjNS FIRM
Congress May Take Action
on Keeping Americans
Off Ships.
RESOLUTION BY
ORDER IS REFUSED
Will be Presented Again To
morrow—Against Any
Legislation.
Washington, Feb. 24.—Senator
Gore announced that he would
offer a concurrent resolution ex
pressing It to be the sense of con
gress that Amerlitans should keep
off armed belligerent ships.
Such resolution would differ
from his bill for the same pur
pose, in that it would not require
approval by the president. It
seeks to remove as a cause for
war the ittiiiry of any American
on an armed belligerent shlpt
Senator dote sought to intro
duce his resolution? and bill by
unanimous consent, but Senator
Brandegee, republican, of Con
necticut, objected and shut out
the proposal. Gore will try again
tomorrow.
Washington, Feb. 24.—Congress as
sembled today with agitation for ac
tion warning Americans off belliger
ent ships overshadowing all other
questions.
President Wilson's supporters work
ed to hold the administration forces
In line and keep the question from the
floor of congress, apprehensive that
smouldering sentiment might sudden
ly blaze up to embarrass diplomatic
negotiations with Germany. The legis
lative situation in both houses favor
ed the administration forces. The sen
ate was in the legislative day of yes
terday, which prevented the subject
from coming up without unanimous
consent. The situation in the house is
similar, but not so secure. Word went
to the capltol again that the presi
dent's opposition to any action by
congress is unshaken. Administration
officials outside of congress expressed
confidence that the president's posi
tion would be supported. It is appar
ent that much of the chafing in con
gress is due to lack of information of
the president's attitude.
Canvass Sentiment.
The foreign affairs committee be
ran a canvass of sentiment in the
fiouse to devetop the extent Jta which
.resolution^ of w^frthrg wottlA ^ej#!®^^

that the democrats had given the pres
ident a certain time, 48 hours, it is
stated, to change his policy, also is
denied by everyone to whom they
were attributed.
No Surrender of Rights.
One possibility that the whole prop
osition might be reduced to a proposal
is that congress express sentiment
that Americans should not bring their
country into danger of war by travel
ing on ships which Germany had an
nounced she will sink without warn
ing. It is pointed out that such action
would be quite different than legisla
tion prohibiting Americans from .tak
ing passage on such ships, and could
not be viewed as a surrender of rights.
Democrats of the house foreign af
fairs committee have agreed that the
technical question of the right of
Americans to travel on armed ships is
not worth risking war over.

The business session of the asso

Captain Barney Boyd of Company L,
stationed at Hillsboro, president of
the association, presiding.
Capt. C. I). locklin, Sr., chaplain of
the First North Dakota regiment of

upon the meeting and the national
guard of North Dakota. He expressed
a wish that the present convention
would do much toward the solving of
the problem for defense.
Mayor Extends Welcome.
Mayor James A. Dinnie followed
with an address of welcome on be
half of the citizens of Grand Forks.
Mr. Dinnie said, in his address, that
the members of the national guard
were those who had come to the front
for the good of the nation. Many, he
said, from this state, had' already giv
en their lives for their country, and
others would do it if necessary.
On behalf of the North Dakota Na

of Bismarck responded to the mayor's
address. The association, he said,
was glad to assemble in this energetic
and progressive oity. The militia of
this state, said the speaker, stands
for the defense of the flag, and all
that it means. The national guard,
said Major Henry, is not anxious for
war, but for the day when peace can
be permanent. But the day ot peace
for the nations has hot yet arrived
and, until it does, these faithful men
will continue to uphold our country's
ffag. The guardsmen stand for the
uplift of humanity the advancement
of the nation, righteousness, civiliza

stood, said the speaker, for the ad

they outnumbered his crew.
lng to the speaker, the plan Is im
practical, and this was agreed to
unanimously at the San Francisco
convention.
The National Guard association of
the United States, said Col. Fralne, is
the biggest force for protection in the
country, but needs to be made much
more effective. The constitution
should be amended, so as to put the
national guard on a federal basis, and
in order that they may be taken any
where in or out of the country at the
will of the war department. The as
sociation should also have better
equipment and training.
The first thought of the citizen sol
dier is for the service of his country,
said the speaker, and with the en
larging. of the regular army and the
development of the national guard,
adequate defense will be supplied this
country.
Needs of the Nation.
Several' things which must be ac
complished by the present congress,
if the country is to be given adequate
defense, said Col. Fralne, are:
1. Increase in the standing army.
2. Amendment, of federal consti
tution to federalize the national
guard.
3. Congress must make the change
at once to better the condition exist
ing.
4. Must increase the efficiency and
make adequate compensation to the
members of the national guard.
5. The association must take stents
to secure the passage of .these laws*
and if/necessary, a special meeting of.
the national association will be called.
Against Continental Army.
The continental army plan has no
supporters among the officials of the
national guard. The plan, if mater

TOO LATE SAY
MENOFSWEDEN
ana 111 wcav
Stockholm, Sweden, Feb. 24.—The
British blockade of Germany has fail
ed. because it came too late, according
to the Swedish press and business
men.
As far as Sweden and other Scan
dinavian countries are concerned, the
blockade only became really effective
last April. For eight months prior
to that time,or since the very start of
the war, the Germans, anticipating
England's tactics, were purchasing
enormous quantities of military sup
plies, especially copper, antimony and
tin, through Sweden, Denmark and
Norway. Importers here are convinc
ed that by the time the blockade was
perfected, Germany had stored up.
such quantities of these and other war
materials as to meet all her needs for
possibly two years.
Claims Resented.
The claims made by the British
government that .great quantities -of
war material have been smuggled into
Germany through Sweden are bitterly
resented by Swedish merchants. These
claims, which have been given as a
reason for placing all sorts of re
strictions on Swedish mercantile
trade, are based on statistics showing
great increases in Sweden's importa
tions from England and America. The
Swedish merchants point out, how
ever, that prior to the war, Sweden
was a heavy purchaser of German
goods.
War Paralyzed Trade.
The war has practically paralysed
this trade, and the country has had
to turn to other markets.
In addition, moreover, it is point
ed out that Russia has placed enor
mous orders for war supplies in Swe
den and that much of the raw materi
al to All these orders had to be im
ported from England or the United
States. The blockade has seriously
interfered with this industry. In
fact, it has forced the price of many
sorts of metals here higher than they
are in Germany. For example, $1.40
a pound is being paid here for tin,
$2.37 a pound for antimony and $1.26
for aluminum.
An opinion frequently expressed
here is that as far as the Scandinavian
countries are concerned, England has
only succeeded In creating ill-feeling
among the neutrals by her blockade
without seriously injuring Germany.

SHIELDS DAM BILL
ATTACKED BY SENATE
Washington, Feb. 24.—The Shields
dam bill was attacked In the senate
yesterday by Senator Cummins, who
declared it would encourage develop
ment by big enterprises to the detri
ment of small ones.
"Great enterprises can adopt the
plans of the secretary of war for the
improvement of the navigation of
streams, but small ones cannot go to
the expense," said the Iowa senator.
"Every grist mill owner on a naviga
ble stream, designated as such in the
law, must come to Washington and
comply with the hard and costly re
quirements of a secretary of war of

Colliers Engaged Brandeis
to Protect "Interests of
the Public."
Washington, Feb. 24.—Mark Sulli
van, editor of Collier's Weekly, told
the senate committee investigating the
nomination of Louis D. Brandeis for
the supreme court, that Brandeis was
employed by Collier's as attorney in
the Ballinger-Pinchot investigation
"to protect its interests and those of
the public."
Austin G. Fox, attorney for those
opposing Brandeis, had told the com
mittee that Brandeis appeared as
counsel for L. R. Glavis, former of
ficial of the land office, about whom
charges against former Secretary Bal
llnger centered.
Sullivan said Norman Hapgood,
editor of Collier's, employed Brandeis,
and no attempt was made to conceal
his employment.
Fox asked the committee to aub
poenae Charles B. Kelly, a New York
attorney, whom he claimed had been
attorney for Collier's during the Bal
linger-Pinchot inquiry.
Fox said he would shotr that Bran
deis told Kelly he did' not wish the
fact of his employment by Collier's
to be disclosed, and did not wish
Kelly to be in the hearing room ex
cept as a spectator.
final analysis, he will pay the rent to
himself. This rent will always be
large enough to leave him no "un
earned increment" in the land. In case
of its transfer, he will simply sell his
Improvements to the new possessor.
Some of the oldest ideals of the
Hebrew race are associated with this
idea of democratizing the benefits de
rived from land. Thus we read in Ex
odus that Jehovah gave the land to
the children of Israel, "one as much
as another."
There is also provision in the an
cient Jewish law for a year of jubilee,
following seventh sabbaths of years,
which means once in fifty years. At
the year of jubilee, all land held by
the people was supposed to revert to
the tribe for redistribution. It is a
question how long this law was ob
served, but it shows the democracy of
the law giver and his recognition that
unlimited private property in land
meant class rule.
There is also this injunction attri
buted to Jehovah, "the land shall not
be bought and sold forever the land
is mine."
The Hebrew people have shaped the
moral concepts of the world more
than any race. It is an interesting pos
sibility that the Jewish National fond
may be instrumental in showing a so
itetton to the, land question whioh still
-vexes civilisation.

With a quarter million Germans hurling themselves at
the French lines in a great effort to break through the west

their stronghold.
The great battle is raging with fury, both sides keep
