"Preparedness"
Isjiscussed
Rev. Green Has Tacked House at The
Itnptist Church.
Rev. O. Olin Green, pastor of the
Mexico Baptist Church, discussed
"Preparedness" in his sermon Sunday
night. He had a large hearing
every seat in the building taken.
Some of the thoughts heN presented
were:
His general text was from Mat.l6:3.
"Ye know how to discern the face
of the heoaveu; but ye cannot dis
cern the signs of the times."
Scripture reading Mat. 24:44
"Therefore, be ye also ready; for In
such, an hour as yethhik not the Son
of man cometh John 18:11," Je
sus saith unto Peter, put . up the
sword into the sheath."
It is well that we try to understand
the times In which we live. God
has placed us here just at this period
in the world's history and that for a
specific purpose. We do well to en
deavor to see the events that are tak
ing place. One event portends anoth
er if we could only see the relation
that exists. It Is a fact that when
there are volcanic disturbances in
one part of the world there is evi
dence of the same in other parts.
What are we to conclude? That there
is - some relation that these volca
noes have a common center of activ
ity somewhere. When we hear rumb
lings of war in Europe, Asia, Africa,
in Australia, in China, and Japan,
and then not only hear but all but
smell the fumes of volcanic eruption
in nearby Mexico, what are we to
conclude? That the fires may
break out in the United States.
Honce our plea for Preparedness.
In the light of present conditions
preparedness in pur Christian duty.
There is much pious talk about Jesus
telling Peter to put up his sword.
But Peter believed in preparedness.
He took his sword with -him to prayer
meeting. His Lord must have known
that Peter had the sword. He did
not command him not to take it.
When the time came that Peter
thought he ought to use it he went
jfor his sword. He used it, too. If
that fellow hadn't dodged he would
J have cut off his head Instead of his
ear.
' Ideals govern the life of a people.
Our Ideals have ever been those of
peace as opposed to aggressive mili
taryism. Because, our Ideals are so
very different "from those of the old
world "America has been cruelly
misjudged", says our President. We
are despised, even hated by the great
nations of Europe, if we are to be
lieve those who have recently come
from v those - countries. Germany
hates us because she thinks we have
favored the Allies. The Allies hate
us because we have taken so much
off Germany. We have talked so
liiueh of peace that they do not think
there is any fight in us.
War for this nation is a possibility.'
To be forewarned is to be fore armed.
We know that war is a possibility
because we have had such a hard
time keeping out of it.
, Preparedness is but the common,
natural law of the universe. Why
did God make the cow with horns,
the dog .with teeth, the cat with
claws, the eagle with talons, the wasp
with a sting, the mule with a hoof, a
mar. with fists if 'He did not mean
hat these were for our protection?
All law recognizes the right .of
self-defense. The New ' Testament
nowhere condemns' the use of force
in civil government of wrong-doers.
"For he beareth not the sword in
vain". -
If til y form of preparedness is jus
tlliable then it should be adequate.
Every city has its police force. This
is essential for protection. Law
against criminals Is not unchristian.
See what the Turks have done to
Armenans! All because they were
not prepared to defend. Unless we
have adequate force better none at
all. Let us either disband our army,
sink our men of war or let us make
them strong enough to defend our
nation.
P. J.DUPONT INJURED.
P. J. Dupont, 26 years old, of Sla
ter, a brakeman on the C. &. A., was
crushed between to cars at Curry
ville Tuesday morning. He was
seriously hurt. He was brought to
the Mexico Hospital for quick
attention.
The Message regrets the deaths of
John Kesler and John Thomas Watts
this week southeast of Mexico. Both
were good men and fine citizens.
They will be greatly missed in their
homes and in the community.
J. G. Ford, Churchill B. Kennan
and J. W. Peck are announced as
candidates for Sheriff. All three
are mighty fine fellows and each
will "have a strong following.
Why, no, the Message is not op
posed to building the new jail if we
have the money. And we understand
the county has the money, and to
spare. Let's have the new jail right
away without any more patient
waiting, for prices might go higher,
"while you wait."
Benton City will vote on the ques
tion of school consolidation soon. We
believe it would be a step forward
that good community would never
regret. . " "'.

Rural School Notes
By CLYDE JOHNSON.
The pupils of E.E.Shay at Benton
City have organized an interesting
literary and debating society. It was
with pleasure that D. M.Clayton, as
sistant to Mr. Gass, and I, listened to
a warm discussion of the quetion. Re
solvpd: That the mule is a more use
ful animal than the horse. It was fine
to see one boy after anotherchampion
the cause of his favorite. This is
experience and training the right
kind of education . .that will be use
ful to thenf all their lives.
The other people of the community
have also organized a society that
meets Friday night. Last Friday they
invited Mr. Clayton and the writer to
expjain Consolidation. Large crowd
present spite of bad roads. There
were representatives from most of
the surrounding districts present
The literary program was interesting
and well applauded. Next Friday will
be a slander suit "Barley Arvis vs
Emil Jungbluth et al publishers of
the Benton Gazette." It seems the
publishers stated that Arvin had
been bootlegging. A very interesting
fight is assured.
Tho half the audience was children
and young people, and the hour late
Mr. Clayton received close attention
for fully an hour, as he explained
the question of consolidation. Ques
tions were aksed, showing, too, the
interest they take in the question.
It did not suit many to come out
at night, we remained in Benton and
held another meeting 2:00 p.m. Sat
urday. At least 75 leading farmers
and business men of the community
were present and again the deepest
interest in the question was shown
It was five o'clock before the last
had left. There was some opposition,
but this was on points that if they
were fully understood would leave
little basis for opposition.
It looks now very favorable for the
organization of a large and wealthy
district at Benton. The proposed plan
includes the districts: Erlsman, Eu
reka Prairie Chapel, Chapel Grove,
Sun Rise, Liberty, Stauffer, and Ben
ton City. This will give them more
than 53 square miles of territory,
nearly 300 school children, and a val
uation of $554,000. This makes a
strong and wealthy district, one that
can ,have a very suitable building,
a first class four year high school
that will prepare their children for
college or university entrance with
out examination, but best of all we
give them a first-class practical edu
cation suited to farmers and all that
at a reasonable cost. Then, too, the
children will be at home. Now who
can estimate' the value of that?
Last summer at the farmers' picnic
at Gant Champ Clark said that he
was in favor of consolidation, and
that, too, after he had made a plea
for better work in our rural schools.
Surely, then, this is a step in the
right direction, and deserves the
assistance and best wishes of all who
are Interested in the best welfare of
the community.
