IK NON-PARTISAN
LEAGUE GETS BUSY
TOWNSHIP CONVENTIONS HELD
THRUOUT THE STATE TUES­
DAY-SOME OF THE THINGS
THE LEAGUE PLANS TO DO.
Township conventions of the Non­
partisan League were held thruout
the county and state Tuesday. The
meeting at the McKinley school build­
ing in this city was quite largely at­
tended and considerable interest man­
ifested. Anthony Walton was selected
as a delegate to the county convention
to be held at Minot some time
March. After the county conventions
are held, a big state convention will
be in order.
From what the Independent can
learn, the League will make recom­
mendations only as to legislative can­
didates and the candidate for gover­
nor. They may possibly take some ac­
tion concerning the candidate for
United States Senator, but will prob­
ably not take much part in the Con­
gressional fights.
They will ask each candidate for tne
legislature to outline his platform and
providing it meets with the require­
ments of the League, and thev deem
him an honest, capable candidate, he
is likely to receive the endorsement 01
the League, whether he be republican,
democrat or socialist. The League
does not desire to take part
d]®or"
panizing any particular party. Rather,
they would rather see the parties re­
main intact, but will
select
candidates
from the various parties who will en­
dorse the League platform. The or­
ganization will use care
and
endeavor
to support about as many democrats
as republicans. An Equity meeting will be held at
The League advocates the estabiisn-
ment of state-owned elevators, mil. ^ere
ago
it was or­
ganized. A man named Townley is
said to have outlined the plan of or­
ganization and he has been a promi
inent factor in building up the organ­
ization. The League now has 30,000
members and fifty automobiles will be
sent out soon to round up a few
thousand more. The membership fee
ting been increased from $6 to $9. ine
League workers say that it costs mon­
ey to send out speakers and besides
there are many other expenses and
they feel that they have to ask for
more money.
The Non-Partisan Leader, the offic­
ial organ of the League, is read with
deep interest thruout the state. The
editor is D. C. Coats, former Lieuten­
ant Governor of Colorado, and once
city commissioner of Seattle.
Speaking of candidates, a man who
lias been taking a good deal of inter­
est in the work of the League said:
"I do not think that the League will
endorse Burdick for Governor, altho
1 think that the body would back him
up for the United States Senate. I
think Burdick could be elected to the
Senate without leaving his home at
Williston. Some of the members of
the League would like to see him en­
dorsed for governor, but there are
others who believe we should elect a
'dark horse,' a man who has not had
•anything to do with the political man­
ipulations within the state. I believe
that the League is strong enough to
elect any man they back up for gov
ernor.
"There is a question whether John
Burke could get the support of the
League for the U. S. Senate, altho it
is possible that he will get the sup­
port of some of its members."

FRAUD TRIED TO FLEECE
RAILROADS.
Seattle, Wash., Feb. 14.—As a re­
sult of the operations of the Hewitt
Lea-Funck company, and G. C. Funk,
general manager, criminal indictments
were returned by the federal grand
jury here, which will bring the cor­
poration and Funck before the bar of
justice.
True bills were returned on ten sep­
arate and distinct counts, alleging de
liberately false misbilling. Mr. Funck
is charged in each case with having1 more water in the pail, he would have
made, out invoices certifying, that the' saved everything. The boy told his
shipment contained only lumber and parents that he had poured gasoline
shingles, although there was included on the fire to make it burn better,
:glazed windows, doors, nails, hard- mistaking it for kerosene.

ware and other building material.
Under section 10 of the act to reg­
ulate commerce, this is made a serious
offense. It especially provides that
anyone who delivers property for
transportation to any common carrier
who shall knowingly and wilfully by
false bills, false classification, false
weights, or false representation of the
contents of a package or the substance
of the property, snail be deemed as
guilty of a misdemeanor and upon
conviction thereof in any court of
the United States of competent juris­
diction, shall be subject to a fine not
exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment in
the penitentiary for a term not ex­
ceeding two years or both, according
to the discretion of the court, for each
offense.
In the language of the indictment
these parties are charged with at­
tempts to receive transportation at
less than lawful rates by means of
loading contraband with carload ship­
ments of lumber and not properly
billing the same to the railroads.
It has been current knowledge in
lumber circles for some time that the
Hewitt-Lea-Funck company were ab­
solutely disregarding all the rules and
regulations of the railroad companies
and defying the laws passed by con­
gress to regulate commerce. They
have persistently announced in adver­
tisements, circulars and personal let­
ters that they were able to save the
consumer exceedingly large sums of
money on mill work and such articles
as hardware, sash, doors, interior trim,
building paper and other specialties
because they incldued such shipments
with the order for lumber and did not
have to pay any higher rate on these
special articles.
The specific cases on which the in­
dictments were made were shipments
to Delta, Utah Norris, Mont. Bil­
lings, Mont. Dawspur, Mont. Far­
go, N. D. Elliott, N. D. Alden, Minn.
St. Paul, Minn. Spion Kop, Mont., and

are some Socialists who are not at all
favorable to the League, but it can be

What Cattle Are Worth.
The Independent, writing to a stock
commission firm in St. Paul, learns
that at present a good class of stock
cattle can be bought in South St. Paul
somewhere from $6 to $6.75 per hun­
dred and a good class of heifers from
$6 to $6.25. Every spring buyers
from this section of the state visit the
South St. Paul market to buy stockers
and young heifers.
F. C. Thornhill, of Joy, 111., who is
connected with the Brush-McWilliams
Co., arrived to spend several weeks
looking after business in this vicinity.
Mr. Thornhill states that several
farmers from Illinois who bought land
in this vicinity last year will soon ar­
rive with stock and other effects. Har­
ry McNall and Mr. Baer will arrive
Saturday wtih two emigrant cars.
They will farm together on land they
bought ten miles south of the city.
Mr. Thornhill reports a very severe
winter in Illinois. He says the ice has
nearly all disappeared from the Mis­
sissippi river.

NEW ROMFORD
CAPITAL FIGHT
CITIZENS CONFIDENT THAT 25
PER CENT OF THE VOTERS IN
50 PER CENT OF THE COUN­
TIES WILL SIGN PETITIONS.
Dr. McLaughlin and W. H. Carson,
prominent New Rockford citizens,
were in Minot Saturday. The doctor
is a brother-in-law of F. B. Lambert.
Thirty-five citizens of New Rock
ford have been touring the state dur­
ing the winter, getting signers on
their petitions for the capital remov­
al. In order to give the voters an op­
portunity to vote on the question in
November, 25 per cent of the voters
in 50 per cent of the counties of the
state must sign petitions and it ap­
pears that this will easily be done.
The petitions may be filed May 7. If
the proposition carries by a majority
vote in November, the matter is taken
before the legislature. If that body
refuses to pass a law providing for
the removal of the capitol to New
Rockford after July 1, 1922, the ques­
tion will be referred to the people,
who may vote again on the question
and in case it secures a majority vote,
the bill becomes a law.
New Rockford has raised about
$12,000 and the citizens are ready to
put in a much larger sum if neces­
sary.
NEW ROCKFORD FARMER
VICTIM OF BRUTAL MURDER.
Geo. Rottel, the New Rockford
farmer who was shot down in cold
blood by His hired man, Nick Chenros,
Feb. 10, died in the New Rockford
hospital. The murderer was arrested
ana will be tried this week. Mrs. Rit
tel, the only witness for the state, told
a gruesome tale of the murder from
the time her husband found the re­
volver in the pocket of the hired man
until the time of the shooting, which
occurred in the morning at half past
five. The doctor for some reason was
not called until shortly after dinner.
There will probably be some sensa­
tional developments, the story being
that the home life was not ideal.

LEGISLATION IS
RECOMMENDED BY THE
EQUITY CONVENTION
EMPHATIC ENDORSEMENT OF
RURAL CREDITS AND POSTAL
SAVINGS BANK EARNINGS
URGE REPEAL OF CANADIAN
RECIPROCITY LAW.
The recommendations of the legis­
lative committee of the Equity con­
vention reported to the convention late
Friday evening and the recommen­
dations were adopted without change.
The declaration on rural credits was
emphatic, both in its constructive pol­
icy and its opposition to the Moss bill.
Among the other prominent questions
upon which the committee spoke em­
phatically are government ware­
houses and the repeal of the Canad­
ian reciprocity law. The full text of
the report follows:
Whereas, No two authorities are
agreed as to what constitutes a fair
and just rural credits system and,
Whereas, the banking fraternity
will corrupt any legislation that might
have a tendency to furnish relief to
the farmers and,
Whereas, The national government
should function for the good of all by
owning and operating all the indus­
tries upon which the people as a whole
are dependent.
Therefore be it resolved:
First—That the functions of the
postal savings banks be extended so
as to do a general banking business,
and that the rates charged the public
be just high enough above the rate
paid depositors to cover the expenses
of handling the business.
Second—That we are absolutely op­
posed to the so-called preparedness
program now before congress. We op­
pose such preparedness because it in­
evitably leads to war, the very thing
which it is supposed to prevent, ana
we are especially opposed to the pres­
ent preparedness program because it
is an attempt to fasten a heavy tax
upon the public for the benefit of the
munition manufacturers.
Third—That we demand that the
government manufacture all muni­
tions of war.
Fourth—That we are opposed to the
'l'^ ^r^l'••li'"f' *. '1f„•'•V*"::T1 T'f
Moss rural credit bill now before con­
gress, because this bill is a deliberate
and premeditated attempt on the part
of Wall street bankers to fasten upon
the farmers a counterfeit rural credit
law, one that would retard the getting
of favorable rural credit laws for
years to come.
Fifth—That in so far as the market­
ing of farm products is a national
problem, we demand of the federal
government the establishment of pub­
lic warehouses in the different sec­
tions of the country, where the pro­
ducts of the farm can be stored and
handled, thus insuring farmers the
highest prices for their products and
at the same time offering to the con­
sumer his necessities at a greatly re­
duced cost, and we further demand
federal grading and inspection of
grain and farm products.
Sixth—That we are opposed to the
reciprocity law offering to grant free
entrance of grain from Canada into
the United States when said offer is
accepted by the Canadian government.
That we deem this law to be detrimen­
tal to the interests of our farmers in­
asmuch as it tends to depress grain
prices in our country so long as this
law is in force and the offer stands
open for acceptance by the Canadian
government, we, therefore, demand
that this law be immediately repealed.
Seventh—We demand that the gov­
ernment own and operate railroad,
telephone and telegraph systems.
Eighth—We recommend to our sen­
ators in congress the indorsement by
thm of Louis D. Brandeis for justice
of the supreme court.
We further recommend that in so
far as our attention has been called
by Congress to the fact that the rec­
ommendations of the farmers and oth­
er organizations of the producing class
would receive much closer attention,
if at the time the recommendations
are made, bills embodying the said
recommendations were submitted to
them. We therefore recommend to
this convention that the attorneys of
this society be employed to draft bills
for putting into opel'aion as soon as
possible he laws so recommended.
Respectfully submitted,
—Grant S. Youmans, Chairman.

MONTANA LAWYER OPENS OF­
FICES IN LEE BLOCK—RESID­
ED IN MINOT YEARS AGO.
Atty. L. M. Ellithorpe has opened
law offices in room 5 of the Lee block.
Mr. Ellithorpe is not a stranger in
the city, for years ago he lived here.
He attended the Minot schools, gradu­
ating with high honors in the class of
1905, the second graduating class
from the Minot High school. He then
attended the Union University of New
York, graduating from that institu­
tion. For four years he practiced "law
in Montana, where he was successful,
but he has always liked Minot, where
a great many of his friends reside.
Mr. Ellithorpe is a bright young at­
torney who is sure to make a success.
Spring Lake Park Pavilion Razed.
The old Hendrickson amusement pa­
vilion in Spring Lake Parjc has been
torn down. For years this mammoth
building has stood a monument to
man's futile efforts to maintain an
amusement resort too far from the
center of the city's activities. The
property was taken over some time
ago by a land company, who have
platted the fifteen acres of land in­
cluded in the original tract and now
offer splendid building lots for sale.
Already a dozen or more handsome
dwellings have been erected and the
lots are going rapidly. This is one of
the most desirable residence sections
of the city and as a consequence many
are taking advantage of this oppor­
tunity to secure a fine lot at a reas­
onable price. The Olson Land Co.,
who own the tract, offer to assist buy­
ers in financing the erection of a
home and the idea is meeting with
much favor.
More-Winters Wedding.
At the Presbyterian manse yester­
day afternoon the wedding of Mr. Al­
bert Moore and Miss Maude Winters

ficiated with the ring service. Miss
Winters was attended by Miss Stein
metzer and Mr. Moore was attended
by Mr. Ralph People, both of Ross.
Mr. Moore is connected with the Con­
sumers Power Co., of this city, and

ding trip.
Elsberry Has Fine Flock of Leghorns.
J. E. Elsberry has won fame as a
breeder of fine Holstein cattle, and
now he is getting to be one of the
large poultry growers of the state.
At present he has a flock of 400 pure­
bred S. C. White Leghorn chickens.
The hens are laying 60 eggs a day at
the present time and their entire out­
put of eggs is disposed of to the Shir­
ley Grocery Co. Mr. Elsberry guar­
antees his eggs to be perfectly fresh.

GAME WARDENS HAVE STRENU­
OUS TIMES—BAD ROADS, DEEP
SNOW AND SWOLLEN
STREAMS MAKE WORK DIFFI­
CULT.
E. B. McCutcheon, chief game war­
den, returned to Minot yesterday from
Walhalla and Langdon, where he has
been for the past week, investigating
some complaints regarding deer kill­
ing. It had been reported that deer
tracks were much in evidence as well
as many blood marks on the snow, and
a trail leading up the side of the
mountain, as if a deer had been kill­
ed and dragged along. The chief had
no difficulty, by following the river,
to locate the spot, and an examination
revealed plenty of deer hair along the
trail, as the ravines in the Pembina
mountains are filled with snow, in
many places ten feet deep. Horses
had to be abandoned and the trail fol­
lowed on snow shoes. It was follow­
ed about a mile, thru dense brush and
timber, finally fetching up at the home
of Alex Langie, where after a little
real Sherlock Holmes work, the deer
head was found, buried in the manure
pile at the barn. This resulted in the
arrest of Langie, and after following
the trail for two miles more, the chief
came to the home of Peter Sharette,
where the skin and remaining portion
of the venison were found.
Both men were taken to Walhalla,
and Langie was convicted and fined
$100, but it was found that Sharette
had to be taken to Lnngdon, as his of­
fense was committed in Cavalier coun­
ty. It was a long 35 mile drive to
Langdon, over very bad roads. At
Langdon Sharette pleaded guilty and
will serve out his sentence in the coun­
ty jail.
Deputy Sull also arrived in the city
yesterday and reports the arrest and
conviction of a party in McKenzie
county for killing beaver. His source
of operations were down along the
Little Missouri, about 30 miles south
of Schafer. This was also a hard trip
to make, as the coulees are filled with
water, and the party got into several
bad holes, once the whole party, war­
den, driver and prisoner, getting a
bad soaking as the water came up to
the top of the sleigh box, when the
sleigh broke thru the ice on the Lit­
tle Missouri. The prisoner, Rodericks,
pleaded guilty and will be sentenced
today by Judge Fisk.
Attended Democratic Love Feast at
Fargo.
The democrats of North Dakota
held their annual "achievement ban­
quet" at Fargo Tuesday night, about
400 men and women gathering. Atty.
V. R. Lovell of Fargo presided. Mes­
sages from President Wilson, John
Burke, W. G. McAdoo, Thos. R. Mar­
shall, Oscar W. Underwood, Postmas­
ter General Burleson and Wm. C.
Bloodfield were read. One of the prin­
cipal speakers was I. J. Dunn, the
man who nominated W. J. Bryan at
the Denver convention. He paid a
glowing tribute to La Follette, saying
he would take off his hat to him, even
tho he were a republican.
Among those from this section of
the state attending were Halvor L.
Halvorson, E. H. Stenvick and Geo.
McClure of this city, and P. M. Clark
and W. B. McLaughlin of Kenmare.
Atty. Beardsley to Locate at Wilton.
Atty. Wade Beardsley, who has been
connected with the F. B. Lambert law
offices for the past five years, will
open law offices at Wilton, N. D.,
March 1. The citizens of that thriv­
ing town have given Mr. Beardsley
some tempting inducements to locate
there and these, connected with his
ability, assures him a nice practice.
Mr. Beardsley is one of Minot's clean
cut citizens and the Independent joins
his many friends in expressing re­
grets upon his departure.
SENIS FARMERS
AT WASH!!
MINOT MAN OFF FOR CAPITOL
CITY TO HEAD FIGHT AGAINST
PASSAGE OF MOSS RURAL
CREDITS BILL.
Grant S. Youmans, who was selected
by the American Society of Equity of
the state of North Dakota to go to
Washington, to represent that body in
its fight against the Moss rural cred­
it bill, left Tuesday afternoon for the
Capitol City. He is also representa­
tive of the Equity society of Montana
and Wisconsin, besides the representa­
tive of the Non-partisan League. Mr.
Youmans thus represents about 40,000
farmers and will at least get a re­
spectable hearing. He will have an
opportunity of placing tho members of
the House and the Senate from the
northwest on record and goes with
strong letters from representative
businessmen of the northwest.
The Moss bill is said to be not at all
what the farmers desire, being vicious
in more than one particular.
