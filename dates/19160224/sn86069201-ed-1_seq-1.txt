A cony of the Chirk County Republi
can, the first i?ur published by the
new management, has just reached our

ing paper und if a republican paper can
succeed in that good live town, Win
chester, Lucien lleckner is the man to
turn the trick. We are glad to have it
among our exchanges und hope for it a
prosperous future. The only possible
objection we could find with it, is its
politics. Luck to you brother lleckner.
QUEEN ROSA.
Owned By W. B. Burton Brings $725.
Men who are posted on tho value of
such animals think that when Queen
Kosa was "knocked down" at the Lex
ington sales last week, for $725, the
purchaser got a big bargain. She was
one of the besl mares our last season
and good judges predicted that she
would bring at least $1500. She was
purchased early lust season by Mr. W.
U. liurton and was handled through the
season by Mr. Mat Cohen, winning
something over $1800 during the circuit,
Taken as a whole the sale was con
sidered the best that has been held In
Lexington for a number of years, good
prices being realized for both saddlers
and trotters.
LANDRAM'S CLAIM
Passes House and Now Looks Like A Cinch
lteprcsentative Mann, of Illinois, Re
publican leader in the House, made an
ineffectual fight on the floor to prevent
the passage of a bill to carry out the
findings of the United States Court of
Claims in the case of Louis Landram
administrator of the estate of William
J. Landrum, who was collector of in
ternal revenue in the Eighth Kentucky
district from 1875 to 18S4.
The bill was passed after the minor
ity leader had resorted to every par
liamentary tactic to delay and defeut
it. The Kentuckian's claim was cov
ered by a bill by Representative liar'
vey Helm and favorably reported by
the Committee on Claims. It seeks to
reimburse the former collector's estute
for commissions on internal revenue
collections for the last four years of his
term of oflice, the claim for the lljrst
lour Having ueer, uiiuweu. me ciuun
for the commission of 1SS1 to 1SSI pre
viously was disallowed by a decision of
the Supreme Court of the United States
under the statute of limitations.
PRICES SOARING
Paper Increase Causes Worry in Printing
Trade Inks and Coloring Materials Up.
Uncertainty us to the future price of
printing paper is caiHing uneasiness in
the printing business. Scarcity of both
dyestulfs and other material used in the
manufacture of paper has driven the
price of paper upward from 25 to 50
per cent., according to deulers, und
printing ink is also much higher. Some
paper mills have stopped making cer
tain kinds of paper altogether because
they aie nimble to secure the proper
coloring material. This is especially
true with regard to blue, yellow and
red paper. Paper mills are refusing to
quote prics for tin future und have
withdrawn nil pi ice lists. In addition
to the lack of dyes the scarcity of rags
it making itself felt. As in to many
other instances the Kiiropeun wur is
being blamed fur the situation. I
Immense stores of rugs in warehouse!

tlie Kentucky Pilot Shop liolli said
printing Ink of certain cjlors cannot be

20 to 300 per cent more than formerly.
A number of laundries are notifying

IIAMLETT DROPS
HIS CONTEST.
In
Headauarters For a
ows and Plow Bear.
An agreement was reached last Sat
urday night between Secretary of State
James P. Lewis, Republican, and Ilarks
dale llumlett. the Democratic candidate
for the ollice in the Ncvcinber election,
whereby the contest for Lewis' seat,
instituted hy Humlutt und now in tho
courts, will be dropped.
A statement made by Mr. Ilarnlett
Saturday night recites that lie still be
lieves th it he wai rightfully elected to
tlie orhce, but tln.t tlie unfortunate de
velopments in Ins family airulrs, the
heavy expense he incurred in the pri
mary and general election ur.d "the
hostile conditions in and out ol the
party," huve made it imjioshible tor
him to continue Ins contest without im
pusing upon his friends und lie with
draws out uf u sense of loyalty to his
family and fur the preservation of par
ty harmony.
It is the oniiiiori in Frankfurt political
circles that Ilamlett's decision lu drop
his contest und make terms with Lewis
was due to Uie luck of encouragement
he received trom the Democratic party
organization, und the formidable in
crease in the expense of gathering
evidence ill (he innumerable ekcliot;
precincts of the State.
Mr. llumlett. who has been working
on his contest since the first of the
year, announced that he would take a
long vacation at Dawson or some otlur'
resort and would later return to Frank
fort to practice law.
COLONIAL TEA GIVEN BY
WOMAN'S CLUB A GREAT
SUCCESS.
One of the prettiest, as well as one
of the most unique, entertainments
ever given in Lancaster was the one
given by the Woman's club in their
beautiful club room in the Graded
school building, Tuesday evening,
for the the benefit of the Library.
Invitations had been sent out asking
friends to come en-costume, "with
powder and patches and gowns of old
times" and many came dressed and in
the spirit of the entertainment. The
room had been decorated most beauti
fully with red, white and blue bunting,
streamers, pictures of Martha and
George Washington and flags galore.
The tea table, set in colonial silver
and white and gold china, where cotTee,
tea, sandwiches und old-time peper
mints were served was presided over
by Mrs. McRoberts and Mrs. Elkin.
The silhouettes, drawn by Mrs.
John Storms, were the most attractive
feature of the evening, evincingnrtistic
skill, many of thu counterfeit present
mets said to be speaking likeness.
These shadow pictures were numbered
and eight guessed the original of every
number correctly. The two first prizes,
u picture of George Washington and a
hatchet went to Miss Elsie Morrow and
Mrs. J. S. Gilbert. The second prizes
went to Mesdames Denny, Davidson,
Miss Kute Kinnaird and Miss Sue
Shelby .Mason. Mrs. George Robinson
received the "booby" prize, u toy
pistol.
In the receiving line was this years
President, Mrs. Robert Elkin, and the
Vice President, Mrs. Frank Marltsbury,
they were assisted in leceiving and en
tertaining by the Presidents ex-oflicio.
Mesdames Kautfman, Kinnaird, Mc
Roberts, Geo. Robinson, Joe Robinson,
Currey und Cook. These ludies looked
and acted the part of colonial dames.
Unique features of the entertainment
were some of the gowns worn. Mrs.
Maltie Duncan woie Mrs. Rebecca
West's wedding gown, while Miss Al
berta Anderson wore that of Mrs. Dor-
ca.i Dabney. Mrs. Cabel Denny looked
quaint with powdered curls, wearing a
large pluid silK of Miss Annie Goodloe'i.
Mrs. Fred Frisbie wore un exquisite
lace mantilla of Mrs. Martha Frisbie,
these costumes, together with those
that had bten made for the occasion
made it one longto be remembered in
the Woman Club.
The Library of this club is growing
daily ur.d the silver offering received
will place books on the bookshelves
that will be n joy to many for years to
come.
