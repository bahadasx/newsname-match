THE "NEW YORK WORLD'S''
COMMENT ON WELSH SINOERS
Sylvester Rowling, musical critic of
the New York Evening World has the
following to say of the concert given
by "The Gwent Welsh Male Singers''
in Aeolian Hall of New York City:
The Gwent Welsh Male Singers scor
ed antoher success last night at Aeol
ian Hall. A large audience enjoyed
their lovely singing and demanded sev
eral extra numbers. The name Gwent
is Welsh for Monmouthshire, the coun
ty in Wales from which the singers
come.
While some of the choruses were in
Welsh far the greater part were in
English, and admirably sung they were
too. The individual voices were of ex
cellent quality and the choir disclosed
splendid unison, fine precision and bal
ance, clean cut attack and delightful
nuance
This is the same organization which
will appear at High School Auditorium
Blackfoot, Idaho, on the evening of
Feb. 25th, with the exception of the
vacancies which were cap sod by the
Lusitania disaster in which several, of
the singers and former conductor Mr.
George F. Davis, lost their lives. Mr.
David Johns, one of the most success
ful conductors in Wales succeeds Mr.
Davis. An entire new program is a
feature of their forthcoming engage
ment.

The news item published in this paper
on the 10th inst., stating that the
Aberdeen Times had been sold and that
D. W. Davis of American Falls was
one of the purchasers, and Commission
er Fugate of Aberdeen, was another,
seems to have been either a political
canard, or the imagination of a Demo
cratic editor. Col. Fugate of Aberdeen
denied this alleged guilt in connection
with the reported newspaper sale be
article was published, and now
after the article has been widely cir
culated by the newspapers of the state,
for political purposes, no doubt, comes
Air. Davis, the Republican farmer
banker candidate for governor, an<l em
phatically declares his innocence of the
charge made against him. We know
Mr. Davis socially and commercially
as a man of unquestioned veracity, and

PROPERTY BRINGS GOOD PRICE
Last Saturday the resilience proper
ty on the southwest corner of Pacific
and Taylor streets, which was the pro
perty of W. E. Barnhart of Spokane,
Wash., was sold for $6000, to Messrs.
W. E. ami B. W. Hopkins, the well
known butchers. While most people
seem to think that the price was high
for residence property, the new owners
do not agree with them and think the
property which is soon destined to be
come business property, was very rea
sonable. The sale was made by J. II.
McDonald. Mr. Barnhart, who is an
ex-resident of Blaekfoot where he was
in the renl estate business with .1. H.
McDonald, bought this property twen
ty-seven, years ago for $200, and it has
been a revenue produced ever since.
The lot is 50x125, and the improve
ments consist of a residence and barn.
It is rumored that the Hopkins broth
ers will build an up-to-date market and
cold storage plant on the property in
the near future.
Numerous Would-BeSheriffs
The county political pot has suddenly
commenced to boil quite strenuously.
The sheriff's office seems to be a great
magnet for office seekers, as there are
about a half dozen whose political am
bition prompts them to a desire to suc
ceed Sheriff Simmons, who we are in
formed is not seriously opposed to a
second term. One of the rumored
aspirants when interviewed said,
"maybe,'' and another denied the ul
legation. All of them seem to be quiet
ly feeling the public pulse as to their
chances of success. We have also been
informed that one of these would-be
sheriffs again hails from Shelley, he is
a Republican and his name is Packer.
He is politically inclined, and we be
lieve would take a long chance to reach
to reach the sheriff's salary. ;
