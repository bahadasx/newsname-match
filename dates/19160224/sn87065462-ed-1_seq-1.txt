Missionary Notes
In explanation of the absence
of any Missionary Notes for the
two nreceeding weeks we will
say that the space was taken up
with other articles. We regret
thi3 as we were anxious for the
public to know of a most delight
ful social meeting: wHiclrtook
place at Mrs. W. 0. Harbour's
Feb. 7th. We were glad to
have our pastor with us. There
were, including visitors, twenty
five or thirty ladies present.
Two of the visitors, Mrs. Boyd
and. Mrs. Brewster joined us.
Another visitor was Miss Beetles.
Another visitor to whom we
wish to call attention was Dr.
Keller's mother, whose every
lineament of her face bespeaks
her christian character. She
sets great store by the old time
class meeting and so do I and
regret so much that the M. E.
church South has relinquished it
We think it good to be at least
occasionally here on earth ar-
rangedf before that great Tribu
nal and confess our sins to Him
and one another.
-Back to our subject, proper.
The house was called to order by
the president, then singing,
scripture reading by Pres. and
Draver bv Bro. Meyers. Busi
ness propositions were brought
i r 1
Hip and discussed, several in
teresting papers and talks were
riven. One paper by Sister
Meyers on 'How we should treat
the immigrant" was enjoyed by
all.
We learned from minutes of
January meeting that Mesdames
Keller, Harbour and Miller had
orcranized a Missionary Society
inVardaman. Such good work
as this puts, the Aberdeen Dis
trict ahead. We hope soon to
to be able to say hurrah for
Okolona who is in the lead.
With God as our guide, so ' good
a pastor and wife to assist us
and such an excellent body of
women to follow how can we
fail?
