ANTI-AIRCRAFT
GUNS OF FRENCH
REACH ZEPPELIN
EYE WITNESS DESCRIBES THRILL.
ING BATTLE IN WHICH GER.
MAN SHIP FELL.
Paris, Feb. 23.—An eye witness of
the destruction of Zeppelin LZ-77 by
French gunners on Monday near Rev
igny, a town nine miles northwest of
Bar-le-Duc, thus describes the exploit:
"Two Zeppelins were signalled at
10:25 o'clock at night by an artillery
officer in a listening post in the first
line trenches of the Argonne.. The
night was clear and the wind mod
erate. The officer could not see the
airships but he heatd the noise of
their engines and telephoned to the
battery base, whence the news was
forwarded to the army corps headquar
ters. All the batteries of the district
were at once on. the alert and within
five minutes searchlights were sweep
ing the heavens in all directions.
"The Zeppelins were first sighted
by an officer commanding a battery of
75 millimeter guns. The nearest was
then about two miles off, flying at an
altitude of about 5,000 feet and rising
rapidly. The second Zeppelin was
some three miles behind the first. The
officer was unable to get the elevation
necessary to hit the airship, but he
gave the exact position to the search
light -operators. From that moment
until it was destroyed the first dirig
ible was never lost to view and the
searchlights never left it. As it was
moving against the wind its progress
was relatively slow.
"As soon as the warning reached
Revigny, five automobiles, with search
lights and with special anti-aircraft
guns manned by naval gunners, start
ed in pursuit. These guns throw a
shell which is expressly designed to
explode on contact with the alumin
um painted covering of the Zeppelins
and to burst into flames once it is in
side. As the car rushes along the road
officer standing in the back of the car
gives the range and directs the fire of
the gun'by the members of the crew,
nfho works the gun lying on the flat of
their backs.
"The guns on the' moving automo
biles opened fire as soon as they came
within range.. A shell burst just be
hind the Zeppelin, throwing it into
strong relief, and immediately the
gunners seized their opportunity. An
other shell passed over the target, but
the next, of the Inflammable type, hit
the mark squarely about seventy-five
feet from the stern! There was a
shout of triumph from the Frenchmen
as the shell appeared to go through
the body of the airship and to adhere
to the right side of the framework,
which it set aflre. A few secondB lat
er two other shells went through the
rear of the car, badly damaging the
steering and elevating mechanism.
"For an instant nothing seemed to
have happened and then a thin red line
crept along the side of the airship,
which shone with a bright ruddy glow.
Then the flames spread and moved up
ward. No explosion was heard as the
Zeppelin began to fall. The great
mass, now blazing more and more
fiercely, descended slowly, while burn
ing fragments of the cover fluttered
away in the wind and all the onlookers
expressed surprise that the airship
took so long to come down.
"The cargo of bombs, which there is
reason to believe were to have been
dropped on the inhabitants of Paris,
exploded with a terrific roar as the
Zeppelin struck the ground. Frag
ments of its car were hurled over 2,000
feet away and the remainder of the
huge framework collapsed in a heap,
the fire continuing to burn for several
hours.
"The second Zeppelin, which had
witnessed the disaster to its compan
ion, turned tail and hurried back to
the German lines.
"It is believed that the Zeppelins
belonged to the croyn prince's army.
The commanders had hoped to steal
across the French lines unperceived,
all lights in the gondolas having been
extinguished, but the head wind prov
ed an obstacle to the speed which is
so essential to the success of an under
taking of the kind and gave the de
fense time to bring up its guns."
The gun crew which fired the shot
that proved fatal to the Zeppelin will
receive prizes amounting to 15,000
francs, 10,000 francs being awarded
by a leading Paris newspaper and
5,000 by Marquis Ornano. Checks for
these sums have already been sent to
the minister of war for distribution.

Intends to Insist on Right
of Americans to Travel
on Armed Vessels
Washington, D. C., Feb. 23.—Heary
Prather Fletcher's nomination as am
bassador to Mexico was ordered re
ported to the senate today by the for
eign relations committee with the re
commendation that it be confirmed as
soon as possible. Senator Borah and
Senator Smith of Michigan, republi
cans, voted against the recommenda
tion.
Chairman Stone will submit the re
port in executive session late today
and an effort will be made to get an
immediate vote on confirmation.
Senators Borah and Smith opposed
the recommendation on the ground
that the United States senate should
not participate in recognition of
Gen. Carranza by confirming an am
bassador.
TO INSIST ON RIGHTS.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 23.—Presi
dent Wilson is unchanged in his op
position to having congress pass any
resolution warning Americans to keep
off armed merchantmen of the Evro
pean belligerents and congress lead
ers have been so advised.
Congressmen who were at the white
house today said there was consider
able discussion of Senator Gore's res
olution to warn Americans off bel
ligerent merchantmen, but that there
was very little prospect of passing it
unless desired by the administration.
TRAINED MEN NEEDED.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 23.—"The
military affairs committee Is of the
opinion that we do not need a large
standing army In this country but that
we do need at all times a large body
of our young men well trained and
educated," said Representative McKel
lar of Tennessee, submitting to the
house today a favorable report on his
bill to establish and maintain mill
tary training schools in the various
states.
"Physical bravery and training
should go hand In hand," said the re
port. "Train 4,800 boys a year as pro
vided in this bill, graduating 100 a
year in each state, and in a few years
such would be the military spirit cre
ated in all parts of the country that
a call for volunteers in times of
trouble would easily bring forth
1,000,000 men."
OBREGON NOT IN JAIL.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 23.—Official
state department advices received to
day, Secretary Lansing said, clearly
disproved reports that Gen. Carranza
practically had imprisoned Gen. Obre
gon or that friendly relations between

for Mazatlan en route to Hermosillo to
be married. Gen. Carranza was said
to be returning to the interior from
his visit to the west coast.
HUNGARIANS ARE
LOYAL TO THE U.S.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 23.—Presi
dent Wilson told a committee of Hun
garians today he had never doubted
the allegiance to the United States of
the great proportion of foreign born
American citizens and that he rero??
nized that they were just as much
Americans as anyone born in the
United States.
Headed by Alexander Konta of New
York, the committee presented reso
lutions passed at a mass meeting of
Hungarians in New York last month
urging allegiance to the United States
and declaring they had been misrep
resented and slandered by attacks on
their loyalty.
Mr. Konta told the president he rep
resented citizens of Hungarian birth
in all parts of the country and that
the Hungarians in the United States
were absolutely loyal to the nation
of their adoption.
The committee told the president
the mass meeting in New York was
a protest against the denial to them
of the right of opinion and the right
of freedom of speech. They said their
ancestors in Hungary fought long for
those rights.
"We claim them," said Mr. Konta to
the president, "and we know that we
shall have them. America is tow to
its fundamental principles."

II. S. ATTITUDE IS
PLEASING TO THE
RUSSIAN PEOPLE
BELIEF EXPRESSED BY CABINET
MEMBER THAT RELATIONS
WILL BE IMPROVED.
Petrograd, Feb. 23. —Addressing the
dtima today. Foreign Minister Sazonoff
reviewed the war situation optimistic
ally although he declared it more diffi
cult now than ever to forsee the end
of the world struggle.
"The Imperial government remains
unshaken in its determination to con
tinue the struggle to conquer the
enemy," he said. "This war is the
greatest crime of high treason against
humanity. Those who provoked it
bear a heavy responsibility and today
stand entirely unmasked.
"We know who it was that let loose
the misfortunes without number with
which Europe is oppressed. Even
German public opinion is beginning to
realise that the German people have
been dupes of those who thought the
hour had come to realize the dreams
of plunder and rapine they had cher
ished so long."
M. Sazonoff, discussing the Russian
American relations, said:
"The interest which American in
dustry has in our markets," he said,
"permits us to hope that in addition to
the friendly political relations now
existing between the two countries, an
economic rapprochment may be
brought about which would be of the
greatest benefit to both nations. In any
case the Russian government will put
forth all Its efforts to this end."
The foreign minister also referred to
the "maladroit and importunate propa
ganda of German agents in America,"
which he said "not only failed in its
object but provoked a certain irrita
tion and appreciably chilled American
sympathies for Germany."
In regard to Russia's relations with
Sweden the foreign minister said:
"Our only sentiment toward the
Swedes is one of sincere friendship.
Any pretext of conflicting interests
could only bo artificial. Russia's his
tory does not Impel her towards the
coast of Scandinavia. She must obtain
an outlet In a free sea in quite another
direction."
M. Sazonoff then turned to Rumania,
saying:
"Rumania will not betray her own
interests and when the hour strikes
she will know how to realize her na
tional unity at the cost of her own
blood. She may be certain that in de
fending herself against the attempts of
a common enemy to interfere with the
independence of her decisions she will
find real support."
The speech of Emperor Nicholas be
fore the duma was devoted principally
to the victory of the Russians at
Erzerum.
"I rejoice that I am able to join you
In thanksgiving for the brilliant vic
tory of our army of the Caucasus," the
emperor said. "I pray for God's bless
ing on your labors in this time of trial
and am convinced you will use all your
experience and knowledge and be guid
ed by love of your country in the work
for which you are responsible to this
country and to me."
