COMMERCIAL CLUB MEETING
Club Adopts Band Signs Road
Petition Sets Date for First
Road Meeting
The Commercial Club meeting last
Wednesday night was well attended
and several important matters were
taken up
The report of the by laws committee
was adopted and that committee ap
pointed to draft n by law showing who
has a right to sit in a meeting of the
club cither us a member or a visitor
The Jasper City Band was adopted
as the official baud of the club and it

Commercial Club Bund
A road petition was laid befors the
club asking for n contribution to the
improvement of the public roads be
tween sections 29 and i2 in Sheridan
Township Secretary Webb was in
structed by the club to subscribe 25
it is to be hoped that the public will
understand t lie position the club has
taken on the question of load petitions
It is not the intention of the club that
these petitions shall conic up in the
regular meetings but will be handed
outside the meeting by a committee
appointed for that purpose This is
necessary in order that the business
meetings may not interfered with by
road petitions Xot tint such petitions
lack importance but that they can and
be more equitably handled in com
mittee The club expects to recognize
these petitions from time lo time and
will make propercontrlbution to them
but the one big objective point to which
the club will work this summer will be
the Jefferson Highway and that is
where they will spend the bulk of their
money IIKCAUSE THE JEFFER
SON HIGHWAY IS A MATTER OF
THHGRHATESTIMPORTAXCETO
ALL und its benellts arc not confined
to one section or one township but to
the whole county and to counties
north and south
On motion of Mr Thomas Wednes

the first load meeting of the spring
campaign The meeting will be held
at Pleasant Hill Schoolhousc
