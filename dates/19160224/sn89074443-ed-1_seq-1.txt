The Biggest Circus That Ever Came to Town
the advance agents of the biggest circus that ever hit this state began advertising its
coming. The advance ticket sale has been good. The indications now are that the big tent will be packed to the
buUt's therule*6
There were a lot of wise guys who hooted at the advance agents' announcements. They wouldn't even agree
to carry water to .the elephants. Now there is real alarm among these wise ones. The reserved seats are practically
all sold and it looks as though the free parade is about all that some of them will get to see.
»-A. When the big tent arrives and the circus opens there will be a wild scramble on the part of some who believe
^hticalarcuses should be shown for their particular benefit and be entitled to free front seats, to crawl under the
tent. But thereTlbe nothin' domV Guards will be on duty and those who tiy such tricks will come to grief and
"WWtmwt
tickets. That's hard luck for those who want to beat their way through life,
