'. in the territory ef Hawaii.
Under the terms of this bill, the

Anti-Saloon league members were
not certain today whether or not the
bill Introduced by Representative Ran
;. lall is that for which Dr. J. W. Wad
man, superintendent of the league,
rent to Washington a few weeks ago
- to - support. While the Gronna - bill,
providing f;" prohibition In Hawaii, is
before Congress, it was fe4 here that
a stronger measure might be success
full ndvocated, and Dr. W adman went
to - Washington prepared to support
such a bill. It is thought probable

The same people will be at the army

trary to the rules in the states, where

That the house Is taking action oa

of Senator James L. Coke of Oahn,
who is in Washington on business.
Coke's Interest in seeing the measure
considered helped to get it reported
out; of committee. ' . , .
'In a Tetter received by Judge A. A.
Wilder, who saw that the bill was in
troduced and gave it a flying start
when' he was in Washington, some
weeks ago. Coke tells how the measure
is progressing. ' , - . !; '
He nodestly claims no credit or
himself; but relates that he found the
bill in a sort of comatose state. In the

S. C. HUBER ENJOYS
TRAVEL, SO HE IS TO
BE U. S. ATTORNEY
Now . Hawaii may know why S; C.
Huber of Tama, Iowa,, wants -to be
U. S.. district attorney for Havali.
When the Star-Bulletin's Washington'
correspondent cabled tne tip that Hu
ber naa tne inside track for the fed
eral Job, everybody wanted to know
who Huber was and why he should be
chosen. The secret Is told by the Star-
cupper, a newspaper or the town of
Traer, Iowa. Here Is the Star-Clipper's
explanation: , ,
-It seems pretty well settled at this
date that S. C. Huber of Tama ia to
get the appointment of district attor
ney for Hawaii. This is a Job he 'has
sought, as he enjoys travel and does
not need the money. . A lot of others
sought it, too, but Mr. Huber's claims
and qualifications both were so for
midable he was considered a likely
winner from the start We consider
the appointment one of the best the
democrats ever made in Iowa. Huber
Is a conscientious. , high-minded and
broad-minded fellow, an able lawyer, a
perfect gentleman. He has in a politi
cal way earned the Job twice over.
With little or 10 hope of success he
has ? repeatedly made : political fights
to uphold the party."!' v-, . -

25th Infantry made the fastest time
for the 100-yard dash ever recorded in
Hawaii. hen he breasted the Upe in
a burst Cf speed in 9 4-5 seconds. This
mark equals the army record, although
no official records are kept. -; -
This race was the banner one or
the day in the preliminaries of: the
military athletic meet at Alexander
field this morning. Gilbert was out of
the holes fast, and showed a burst of
speed at he arose in the first few
stride!.' He took the lead from the
start end was running In. pretty, form.
After the 50-yard mark waa reached
the 25th representative seemed to in
crease nis speed ; witn every , striae
and hurled himself into the cord five
yards ahead of Smithy 1st Infantry.. In

Lleuts, Schneider: Pepin and Martin

es caught the colored flyr ta the re
corded time. J The mother watch showr
ed 9 3-5 for the distance.. Gilbert is a
great sprinter, and, although many be
lieved that the time was too fast, still
the watches recorded the. time under
even mark: and It is certain that tne
cinder tfath expert is at all times
close to A flat runner. j '.
He Runs Llk Morse.
Gilbert's form closely resembles
that ef Morse, the colored runner who
was last year's national champion in
the furlong. He has a long stride, and
gets sway fast off the mark. His first
few strides are carefully taken and he
rises np for, his spurt In excellent
form. Gilbert is destined to be the
favorite in the finals, despite the fact
that Mills is picked by many to finish
ahead In the century. ' V
"Mills, who is the present champion
of 'the service, was pushed by Bray, of
the 1st Infantry In the 220-yard run.
Rounding the turn the 25th man and
Bray, were running together. ' At the
100-yard mark Mills was leading, but
in the last 40 yards Bray made a great
finish and Mills breasted the tape less
than one yard to the good. The time
as announced was. 22. 4, which should
be lowered In the' final event Van
Pelt of the 2d Infantry was third, with
Herzog of the Coast Defense fourth.
Were Many Favorites. x
Spectators lined the fields as the
sprint events were run off and each
one had a favorite in the field.: Mills
naturally was picked as a star by
many : of, the athletic fans, but both
Bray and Gilbert had many friends
who expected them to finish In the
lead. Mills and Gilbert should fur
nish a great race in the sprints. They
are both about . the same, size and
have an abundance of speed. Of the
two speed burners, Gilbert showed
the best form today, and In the ahorter

American travel on vessels of the belligerents. .. .
He. sought to introduce under "unanimous consent" a resolution
expressing that it shall be the sense of Congress that American should
not travel on armed belligerent vessels. This differs from his previ
ous bill because it docs not require the approval of the president. .. .-.

to any American on a belligerent vessel.
