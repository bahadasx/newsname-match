A NATION-WIDE BABY
WEEKJABGH 4-11
During the past year and a half,
many baby weeks have been held
in cities and towns thruout the
United States.
The success of these campaigns
has been so great that Baby Week
will be celebrated all over the
country this year and will be a
permanent feature each year hence
forth. And why not? Are not the
babies the men and women of the
future? If you haven't children
yourself you are interested in other
people's children. If you are not
parents' physically, you are spirit
ually. And since our brothers are
slaying each other across the sea,
we have greater need to save our
babies.
We are conserving our forests,
our mines, our water power. What
are we doing to conserve human
life, our greatest national asset?
' Do you know that 300,000 babies
died last year in our country? Do
you realize that half of these would
now be living had they been pro
perly fed and clothed? This high
infant mortality means a waste of
money, pain and sorrow, which we
can and must prevent.
v Dr. Ve Vries who has devoted
many years of her life to specializ
ing upon the needs of children,
says: "Do you know what a serious
and dangerous thing it is to be a
baby?" The baby needs fresh air
and sunlight as much as any plant.
Like a plant, the baby will droop
and die if kept inthe house.
Cleanliness in and about the
house is even more important to
the baby than to the adult. BABY
: CANNOT protect ITSELF against
DUST and FLIES.

BOUND OVER TO
SUPERIOR COURT
The case of the state vs. Hanford
Scott and Bill Morfian, . on the
charge of stealing cattle, was given
a preliminary hearing before Judge
Twitty on Wednesday afternoon.
Sufficient evidence wa3 introduced
in the opinion of the judge, to
justify binding both over to the
Superior Court. The bond was
fixed at $1000 each.
The complaint against Morgan
and Scott was signed by Ed Ham
ilton. Both were arrested last Sat
urday and released pending a hear
ing, under a thousand dollar bond.
The evidence leading to the arrest
was found by inspector Eakins and
Mr. Hamilton while the two were
out at Morgan's ranch at Bull
Tanks, to get a horse claimed by
Hamilton. Pieces of two partly
burned cattle hides, hoof bones and
other evidence was found which led
the inspector to believe that beeves
had been killed there without being
properly accounted for. A long
eared calf was found also. This
calf was seized by the sanitary
board and is being held while own
ership is being established.
The horse in question was claim
ed by both Hanford Scott and Mr.
Hamilton. It had formerly belong
ed to Scott's mother. Mr. Hamil
ton seized the horse. It was brand
ed K. A. and had a T Diamond
brand which proved to be only a
hair brand. Scott claimed that
his mother4had given this horse to
him but since Mr. Hamilton, has
shown a clear bill of sale for it from
Mrs. Kay, it is understood that he
will not contest the ownership.
- .The case against Scott and , Mor
gan will be heard before the next
term of the suqerior court.

F. M. Geld was in Flagstaff the
first of the week, on legal business.
Chas. Emerson left Monday, for
a short vacation in Los Angeles
and San Francisco.
S. O. Miller left Saturday, for
Prescott. He has converted his
touring car into a truck. He
shipped it ahead of him and will
use it to haul ore from his mine.
45 LIGHTS FOR
Councilman Kirkpatrick has just
distinguished himself by the effic
ient work which he has done as a
committee of one, on lights. The
Council appointed him on this com
mittee at the regular meeting a
month ago.
Heretofore the Town has not had
a long term contract with the com
pany. This was unsatisfactory for
both parties. The Town was forced
to pay more for lights ihan should
have been necessary under a long
term contract, and the Company
had no assurance that the town
would continue to use their
service.
The new contract is for ten years
and calls for 45 lights at a monthly
cost of $100. Formerly, 23 lights
frequently cost more than this
amount. BABBITT'S
BUY
CATUN
GARAGE
Babbitt-Poison Company last
week bought out the W. W. Cat
lin garage, one of the largest in
Phoenix. They will now consol
idate the state agencies for the
Chevrolet and Buick and make
this their head-quarters. They
will run a public garage and gen
eral repairshop. This gives them
one of the largest if not the
largest establishment in the
state.
W. E. Gardner, formerly of
Williams, has been put in charge
of the garage and J. M. Holub,
has been offered the position of
bookkeeper. Mr. Holub is loathe
to leave Williams and has not yet
decided whether to accept the
position or not. 1
THE NEWJLLI1S
BY MRS. A. SINE
(Continued from Feb, 10) '
On the North side of the railroad
tracks, the United States govern
ment have established a school for
military training and in connection
therewith' an aeroplane manufac
tory. This was deemed advisable
because the location of Williams is
ideal for the concealment of opera
tions, enemies of the country being
unable to spy upon the plans of the
government. Adjacent to this mil
itary reservation is a fine riding and
driving pork in which are hand
some pavilioBS for county fair pur
poses. Coconino county l.al tean
divided in 1917 and Williams had
become the county seat. The fair
is eminently successful, principally
by reason of the immense herds of
cattle, . bands of sheep, splendid
breed of horses and other livestock
upon the ranges in close proximity
to the city.
The county officers for the first
term of the new county may be
found in the Williams Daily Chron
icle of November the 10th, 1917.
This paper is a worthy successor of
the Weekly News, and numbers
among its editors those of the old
News staff.
After a ride in an auto for a mile
to the West, they entered the cir
cular driveway of the Silent City.
Its flower-bordered paths, green
lawns, and large pine trees, make
it as beautiful a resting place for
the living, as for those gone from
mortal ken. A mile further and
they learned something of the work
of the Forest Ranger. A mile and.
a half to the Northwest and Ele
phant park was in view. How?
When? By what wonderful ero
sion were these monuments shaped?
How wae a large boulder of lava
firmly balanced on a pedestal of
an entirely different formation?
