If War Were Waged on Sea, American
Commerce Would Be Paralyzed
By Dr. EMORY R. JOHNSON. Professor Transportation, UraVensty
of Pennsylvania T
THE effect of the present war, severe ss it is, is slight in comparison
with what the result would be were not the seas controlled by one
of the belligerents and the theater of war thereby limited to re
stricted areas of the ocean near the coast of Europe.- The flag of the
belligerent that has thus limited the theater of marine warfare happens
to bo the flag under which more than two-fifths of ths> total deep sea
tonnage of the world is operated, and in spite of the destruction of ship
ping that has occurred during the last year and of the withdrawal of
merchant vessels for military and naval uses, the commerce of the world
is able to employ a large tonnage of vessels under the flag of belligerent
nations. If the European war were being waged upon the ses as widely
as iff is beine fought upon land AMERICAN FOREIGN COMMERCE
WOULD BE PRACTICALLY PARALYZED AT THE PRESENT
TIME.
NO ONE WILL. SERIOUSLY QUEBTION THE ECONOMIC NECESSITY
OF HAVING A LARGE MERCHANT MARINE UNDER THE NATIONAL
FLAG DURING SUCH A WAR AS IS NOW IN PROGRESS, BUT THERE
ARE MANY WHO STILL DOUBT THAT THERE IS ANY SPECIAL NEED
OTHER THAN A NAVAL ONE FOR HAVING A LARGE MERCHANT MA
RINE UNDER THE NATIONAL FLAG. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE
MERCHANT VESBELS OF ALL NATIONS COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER
TO BECURE THE TRAFFIC OF ALL COUNTRIES, AND THAT OCEAN
FREIGHT RATES, BEING CONTROLLED BY THIB COMPETITION, IT
MATTERS NOT TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES WHETHER
THEIR COMMERCE BE HANDLED IN SHIPS OF AMERICAN OR FOR
EIGN REGISTRY. THE ARGUMENT, HOWEVER, IS NOT CONVINCING.

LYNDEN TEAM TO MEET
LAUREL IN LAST DEBATE
The last debate of the school year
will take place on Friday evening,
March 3 at the high school auditor
ium. Lynden will meet Laurel and
will again uphold the affirmative of
the Monroe Doctrine question.
From the four debates to be held
during tbe year Lynden has already
won three and by detesting Laurel
might gain the District Champion
ship.
It might be of interest at (his
time to notice to notice the man
ner of awarding the championship.
Each of the four debates of the
season is decided by three Judges;
each judge's decision counts one
point toward the championship.
From this it will be seen that the
greatest number of possible votes
would be twelve which would mean
four unanimous decisions. In other
words, Lynden might win four de
bates each by a 2 to 1 decision and
still lose to a school which won
three unanimous decisions and lost
one entirely.
Lynden has two seniors on the
team: Cliff Worthen and Albert
Booman. This will be their last hig
school debate and *' erefore the last
oiportunlty to hear them. All
speeches are being revised so that
an Interesting contest Is assured.
Many people of the Lynden dis
trict felt the earthquake that shook
the county Tuesday morning at 3:40

most severe noted in this district for

ably, but no damage was recorded.
