Geo. A. Comerer in Ayr town
ship on Thursday morning, Feb

years, 5 months, and 12 days.
The funeral, conducted by her
pastor, Rev. R. E. Peterman, of
the Lutheran church, took place

Bhe took grippe a few weeks ago,
and she did not possess sufficient
vitality to withstand the attack.
The deceased was born near
Waynesboro, and on Valentine
Day, 18G0, she was united in
marriage to J. George Tritle, of
Ayr township, this county, and
they went to housekeeping on
the farm at present owned by. the
McGoverns, and lived there until
about twenty years ago, when
they moved to McConnellsburg,
where the husband died on the
14th day of March, 1906.
To Mr. and Mrs. Tritle were
born nine children, six of whom
are living, namely, Scott,
Arnie wife of James Fryman,
Fn.nk, Jacob Walter, Allen Win
ter, and Etha May, wife of Geo.
A. Comerer. There are, also, 13

original Akers farm 1 mile from

months, and 28 days. He was a
direct descendant of Ephraim
Akers, Sr., the first of the name
to settle in Brush Creek Valley.
On this farm he was reared, and
with his wife Mary A. Akers, he
resided there until 1898, when
his family were well grown, when
he removed with his family to
Keyser, W. Va., where he spent
tthe remainder of his days. To
Oaleb and Mary Akers were born
ileven children, all of whom are
iving, as is also the mother.
The deceased was a man of un
mpeachable character, and pos
tessed high aspiration for the
welfare of his family. His one
thought seemed to be for their
comfort and advancement With
his fellow-men, he was the soul
of honor, and his word, always
as good as his bond. He had so
lived, that when he came to the
close of almost fourscore years,
he could say with a smile light
ing his face, "I am ready to go."

Note. There are two reasons
why Mr. Reisner's article does
not appear in the News this week
one is, there is no cotton being
cultivated in this county; the oth

WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.
Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin F. Wible Spared
to Complete Sixty Years of
Harried Life.
On Saturday last, Mr. and Mrs
Benjamin F. Wible, of Todd
township, quietly celebrated their
sixtieth wedding anniversary,
Benjamin F. Wible and Matilda
Heck were married February 19,
1856, at Three Springs, Huntings
don county. Mr. Wible bought
a farm and erected a house be
fore his marriage. They lived in
the same house all these years up
to July last, when they disposed
of their property and left the old
homestead to make their future
home with their son Frank in the
neighboring village of Knobs
ville.
Mr. Wible is now in his eighty
sevenin year ana Mrs. wible, in
her eighty-fourth. This aged
1 1 1 M
coupie are tne parents or nine
children as follows: Mrs. W. S
Brant Mrs. R. B. Cline deceas
ed, Lincoln, Frank, Lewis, Mrs
E. J. Hamil deceased. David.
Harvey and Olin. All the mem
bers of the family living, reside
in Fulton county, except Lewis
H. Wible, who is the Statistician,
Department of Agriculture, Har
risburg, and H. Olin Wible,
teaching in the Pennsylvania In
dustrial Reformatory at Hunting'
don. There are thirty-four grand
children of which twenty-nine
are living, and thirty-seven great-grand-children.
Thus it will be
seen that Mr. and Mrs. Wible
have a progeny of eighty linea!
descendants.
Mr. and Mrs. Wible both came
from large families; but, in this
connection, we note that Mr.
Wible is the only member of his
parents' family living, except
one sister who is two years older
than he. Mrs. Wible is the only
remaining member of her par
ents' family. They have always
enjoyed simple life and, no doubt,
to this in a large measure is due
their good health and long life.
However, their ancestors were
noted tor their longevity.
Mr. Wible is a veteran of the
Civil War, having been mustered
into the service on November 4,
1862, private, Co. H. Regiment
158, Penna. Infantry, and hon
orably discharged August 12,
1863.
He was again mustered into the
service November 28, 1864, pri
vate, Co. K. Reg. 67 Penna. Vol.
Inf., and honorably discharged,
at Armory Square Hospital,
Washington, D. C, July 3, 1865.
He was present at Lee's surrend
er at Appomattox Court House,
Va., April 9, 1865. .
During the time that Mr. Wi
ble was in the service of his
country, Mrs. Wible was at home
with her four babies overseeing
the farm work and, 1 ike many
other good mothers, she en
dured many inconveniences and
great hardships.
Her Fifty-First.
Last Sunday was the 51st birth
day anniversary of Mrs. James
Mellott, Pleasant Ridge, and
in some way or other her neigh
bors found it out, and her home
was filled with friends extending
congratulations, and bringi n g
with them gifts as tokens of
their good will. Of course, no
body went home hungry. Those
present were: Rev. John Mellott;
ames B., Lizzie, George, Hester
Lucy, Mabel, Earl, Lester, Fran
ces, Flora, Laura, Viola, Mary
and Lue Mellott; Jordan, George,
Ally, Henry, Melford, Mabel,
thel, Lenora, Mrs. Ally, Rich
ard, Judson, Floyd, Thesta, Eth
el, Gladys, Edna, Jane, and Ella
Deshong; Florence, Martha, and
Jane Wink; Dayton Shives and
Mary Morton.
Mrs. Bertha Ramsey and son
Frank went to Philadelphia Mon
day! Her sons Roy and Paul,
and her daughter Beulah, have
been in that city for some time,
and Mrs. Ramsey expects to lo
cate permanently there.
Country Churches.
Is the number of country
churches disproportionately large
when compared with the popula
tion of the community in which
the respective churches are to'
cated? Is the membership of
our rural churches increasing
Are denominational differences
as strongly marked as they were
a half century ago? Is not the
sentiment of federated effort
among protestant denominations
growing rapidly? These and
many other questions have been
submitted by Franklin Repository
(Chambersburg) to active rura!
pastors and laymen, and their
answers published in that paper.
The following from a former
pastor of the Presbyterian church,
McConnellsburg, and published
in last Friday's Repository wit
De reaa witn interest ty our
home people.
"Your communication in refer
ence to the rural churches came
a few days ago. I will discuss
the questions in order, basing my
remarks on what I have seen and
read.
"No. 1 I believe that two
thirds of rural churches are di
minishing in membership, yet I
am fully convinced that a better
dav will soon dawn.
'No. 2 There are a number of
reasons, lhere are too many
struggling churches, too many
denominations, where one or two
churches could well serve the
community, and command a re
spectful hearing. Then, too, the
more active blood flows into the
city, leaving the more satisfied,
yet less active blood, to maintain
the country. I was raised in the
country, hence no disrespect in
ferred. The automobile, while
taking some rural people to the
town church, has, as a means of
pleasure, made great inroads in
to the rural church. Also the
country minister, in many cases,
does not understand the needs
and the lives and the problems
of the country and its people. In
some cases the country minister
is not an able man. He is poorly
equipped for his work. This is
an age of doing things in a prac
tical way. In many cases the
rural church has failed here.
'No. 3 Church membership
in our community is holding its
own. bmce April hrst we have
received fifty-eight new members
by profession of faith. The local
Brethren church, known by many
as the Dunkard Church, is strong
and prosperous. Other churches
in our district have become weak
ened through discord.
No. 4 Consolidation wbere
possible. This is a hard problem.
A capable, efficient minister, re
siding on the field.
1 have only touched on the
above questions, but trust I have
been of service to you.
John Maclay Diehl."
Fractured Limbs.
On Monday of last week, Jo
seph Strait Needmore R R 2,
had the misfortune to break one
of his legs about four inches
above the ankle. Our informant
did not know just how it happen
ed. Mr. Strait and his son had
been cutting cord wood and they
were returning to their work aft
er dinner when the accident oc
curred. Will Strait son of Edward
Strait, near Sipes Mills, fell off,
or was thrown off, a horse last
Saturday, and one of his arms
broken.
Batch for Winter Eggs.
Taking it for granted that
proper winter quarters and feed
will be provided, the only other
'secret" for-winter egg produc
tion is the age of the pullets. If
hatched too soon, they may lay
or a short time in early winter
and then moult If hatched too
ate, they will not mature before
winter. In our latitude, for Leg
horns, April 15th to May .1st is
right time to hatch the peeps.
arger breeds, such as the Rocks
Rhode Island Reds, Wyandotts,
&c, should be hatched in March
and early April.
SCHOOL DIRECTORS CONVENTION.
The Most Largely Attended, and the
Host Instructive and Enthusiastic
Gathering Yet Held.
The school directors of this
county met in annual convention
in the Court House last Thurs
day, at 1:30 p. m. The meeting
was called to order by the chair
man ievi Keeter, ana it was
found that 41 directors werepres
ent.
The first subject "School Visi
tation by Directors" was ably dis
cussed by U. G. Humbert, G. A,
Harris, Lewis D. Wible, M. A,
Barkman, Clem Chesnut and oth
ers. The feeling is, that schoo!
visitation by directors is an ab
solute necessity, and that no di
rector who has had an opportu
nity, and has not visited the
schools has a moral right to vote
for any of the applicants for
school at the next school letting,
Dr. C. H. Gordonier was in
troduced and he spoke on "Ru
ral School Problems." In this
discussion he showed plainly that
the poorer school districts are at
ways kept at a financial disad
vantage by our law-making bod
ies. After this discussion the
convention adjourned to 7:30
the evening.
Thursday Evening. "
in
The audience was treated to
some fine instrumental and vocal
music. Space prohibits the enu
meration of the selections used
but, at least, one half hour was
devoted to musical entertainment
by Miss Emily Greathead, Miss
Minnie Reisner, Mrs. George W.
r n .ii S
ueisner, bcott Kunyan and
George W. Reisner. It is suffi
cent to say that this feature of
the evening exercises was highly
entertaining and highly appre
ciated.
Dr. Gordonier then gave his
Fire lecture." It is needless to
say that the Doctor's nice easy
way of presenting such a prac
ticai discussion containing so
much good humor was well re
ceived by a delighted audience of
nearly four hundred people.
Friday Morning.
The subject "School Sanita
tion" was opened by Prof. Clem
Chesnut followed by T. S. Her-
shey, Harry Henry, Erby Booth,
M. A. Barkman and many oth
ers, and it was well discussed
from two principal view points
the school room, and the out
buildings. We believe that this
discussion will better some un
sanitary conditions in present
existence.
Dr. Gordonier occupied the
next period with a lively discus
sion. His subject was Public
Sentiment After Dr. Gordonier
had finished his address, Prof.
Chesnut offered the following
resolutions which were unani
mously dopted:
Realizing, as we do, the need
of more professionally trained
teachers for our district schools :-
Resolved, that we respectful
ly ask the Board of Normal school
Principals to offer a course of
study especially suited to rural
school needs.
Resolved, That we petition
the members of ourtate Legis
lature to so readjust the distribu
tion of public school funds that
our smaller counties and school
districts financially weak, shall
receive a larger proportionate
share than we now receive under
the present plan.
A. D. Hohman, M. A. Bark
man and C. L. Henry appointed
to secure an organization for the
succeeding year made the follow
ing recomendations:
President, Levi Keefer; First
Vice-president Clem Chesnut;
Second Vice-president C. T. Lay
ton; Secretary, Scott Hershey;
Treasurer, Geo. A. Harris.
Committee on Programs: Dr.
J. W. Mosser, U. G. Humbert
and Lewis D. Wible.
We wish in conclusion to thank
all who contributed to the suc
cess of our convention and es
pecially do we thank the musical
entertainers for the excellent
music on Thursday evening.
Committee on Program,
FEDERAL AID IN SIGHT.
James A. Stewart Reviews Congress'
ional Action Toward United States
Going Into Road Building.
Dear Editor. Kindly allow
space to tell your readers of good
things coming. The writer has
always thought that federal aid
should be given to build and main
tain post roads: but for some nar
row, 'stinted, and political rea
sons, it has always heretofore
been refused. The good news
has at last come that a bill has
been introduced in Congress, cal
ed the Shackelford bill, carrying
an appropriation of $25,000,000
to aid all the states to improve
their post roads, each state to
share the appropriation on the
basis of its population and the
numberjof miles of these road3,
every dollar to be disbursed on
actual building and maintenance
of post roads, and not to be di
verted to any other purpose.
Our congressman, B. K. Focht
informs the writer that the new
Shackelford road bill passed the
House with but little opposition,
and that he is hopeful of its pas
sage by the Senate. Of course,
the present appropriation even
if passed will not go very far
in each state, but it will be grand
and glorious beginning, and sub
sequent appropriations will, in a
few years, make and maintain
all post roads in every, state.
Hon. B. K. Focht wrote: "This
additional helpfulness from the
government would greatly stimu
late road building and materially
aid quality and durability of con
struction." He hopes this desir
able piece of legislation will pass
at this session of Congress.
The government and the peo
ple of the United States expect
rapid delivery and collection of
mails, which can only be done by
making and maintaining good
roads so that carriers could use
automobiles and other rapid ways
of travel.
The Senate should have enough
public spirited and fair-minded
men to pass this important bill.
Hope all the citizens of Fulton
county will write our Senators,
Hon. Boise Penrose, and Hon.
Geo. T. Oliver, at Washington,
D. C, urging them to use all
their influence in getting this
bill passed at this session of Con
gress, bvery man will see its
great importance if he will but
think of the many miles of post
roads.
Met Fifty Years Ago.
Mr. P. D. Calhoun, of Harris-
burg, and Mr. Jacob Hatz, of
Lancaster, representing the W.
U. telegraph company, attended
the funeral of Thomas F. Sloan
ast Friday. Fifty years ago Mr
Hatz with a light gang of repair
men passed through McConnells
burg inspecting the lines of the
Company. It was at that time
that Mr. Sloan and Mr. Hatz met
for the first time, and for the
ast for while both remained in
the service, they never again
met Just a few days before
Mr. Sloan's death, he spoke to
his family of the time Mr. Hatz
and his men were in McConnells
burg. Mr. Hatz remembered Mr
Sloan very well. Mr. Hatz is
now on the retired list on half
pay.
Goes to Cuba.
After having spent ten days in
this place nursing a severe attack
of rheumatism, as noted by the
News last week, Emory Booth
eft on last Monday for Altoona.
His physician has recommended
a complete change of climate for
him Florida and Cuba. The
ennsylvania Railroad Company,
by which Mr. Booth is employed,
generously gave him a pass by
way of southern Florida to Cuba,
and he started for the former
state yenterday, to be away for
an indefinite period. A trip like
that ought to help him regain
his lost seventy-five pounds avoir

HEALTH AND TAXES.
Little Talks on Health and Hjgiene by
Samnel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of, Health.
Individual illness places a tax
upon the entire community. The
prolonged sickness of wage earn
ers is apt to result in poverty for
themselves and their families.
Indigency and crime itself are of
ten lurking in the trail of dis
ease. National efficiency must rc6t
upon the sound foundation of
health. The reduction of sick
ness and death from preventable
disease should be the firdt step in
our preparation for self-defense.
Lord Beaconsfield said, "The pub
lie health is the foundation on
which reposes the happiness of
the people and the power of a
country. The care of the public
health is the first duty of a states
man." In some States in the Union
there has been an increasing per
centage of dependents as they
have become more thickly popu
lated. In addition to the enor
mous losses from death due to
preventable disease when health
laws are enforced, there is a tre
mendous annual expenditure ne
cessitated by this growing num
ber of those who are unable to
bear their part in the world's
work.
The insane, the feeble-minded
the consumptive and the pauper
are a heavy burden upon the
tax payer.
Provisions and expenditures
which will aid in the reduction of
those things which sap the vital
ity of the Nation, will aid in pre
venting the increased taxation
for the support of the growing
army of the unfit
Take Notice, Motorists.
Judge Davis of Philadelphia
has just made a few very impor
tant remarks on the subject of
what constitutes reasonable care
in the conduct of drivers of au
tomobiles. In the case before
him a young man ran down and
killed a woman and the sentence
was one year in prison.
The driver explained that he
had lost control of the wheel and
that the car ran up on the side
walk and struck the woman be
fore he could stop it But the
judge pointed out that inability
of the driver to control the car
was not a mitigating circum
stance, since he jeopardized the
ives of pedestrians by his igno
rance.
Everybody who assumes .o run
a motor-car does so at his own
risk. Even though proof of com
petence and proficiency is not
exacted by the State as a prere
quisite to license, the law pre
sumes that the operator is quali
fied, and if he is not he must be
prepared to stand the consequen
ces of his acts. Ignorance of
how to run a machine is no more
excuse than ignorance of the law
itself.
Half-Pay 175 Weeks. .
Charles, the sixteen-year-old
son of W. H. Truett of Cham
bersburg, met with an accident
the shops of the Melville
Woollen company last week which
necessitated the amputation of
all fingers on one hand except
the little finger. Part of the
thumb was also removed. Ac
cording to the Workman's Com
pensation act the lad will be en
titled to half pay for 175 weeks
by the company in which the
Melville Woollen Mills are insur
ed, with the exception of the
first fourteen days, during which
time he will be cared for by the
employers, under the act The
injury is classed as "permanent;"
hence the liberal allowance which
is the same as for the loss of one
hand.
James Seibert, of Path Valley,
aged 21 years, accidently shot
and killed himself while in the
mountains hunting foxes last
week. I-
