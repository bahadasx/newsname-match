ASSOCIATION
CITY ATTORNEY STATES THAT
CITY CANNOTGIVE LEASE, BUT
CAN GIVE GRANT FOR NUMBER
OF YEARS.
At a recent meeting of the city
commissioners, the secretary of the
Carter County Free Fair association
appeared before that body and asked
ithe city officials 40 give the associa
tion a louse on the old fair grounds
for n number of years. This matter
was referred to the city attorney to
investigate the validity of such ac-
j Hon, and lie is ready to report at the
; next meeting; of the city commission-
ers tlie result of his investigation.
He staled this morning that under
; ,,1P ci,v rmiia not ?rant
lease on this property, but that they
could give a grant for a term of years,
or indefinitely, for the benefit of the
fair association, and he further stated
that in his opinion there would be
no opposition to the suggestion by the
mayor or any of the commissioners.
The officers of the fair association
are very anxious to have this matter
settled, as they want to Issue their
catalogue and premium list in the
j near future, and want to know just
I what the attitude of the city will be
, in the premises. The association has
a big job cut out for themselves this
summer, in order to get ready for the
fair in September. The necessary
buildings must be erected, the track
repaired, and the grandstand erected.
All this will take time, and the of
ficers are anxious to have the ques

APPROPRIATION FROM FEDERAL
TREASURY PROPOSED TO SET
TLE WITH THEM ROLLS MAY
NOT BE REOPENED.
Washington, Feb. 2:!. Congress
may terminate the fight long-waged
by represertatives of the Mississippi
''hortiw.- tor participation in l!ie
funds of lie C!'oetaws in Oklahoui i
in making a m itlement by an appro
priation from the federal tr.v.si.:.'.
agreeable to a suggestion made be
for the senate committee on Indian
affairs today. Senator Ashurst has
indicated to Senator Williams of
Mississippi that .such a course might
meet with approval, and Senator
Grnnnn, member of the committee,
eNprcsst d a similar view.
The quesiton arose during consid
eration, of the Choctaw and Chicka
saw per capita payment item in the
Indian appropriation bill. The oppo
sition of the Mississippi members to
the per capita item has always been
seized by representatives of claim
ants to enrollment a:- a method to
secure reopening of the rolls which
were closed by act of congress years
ago. While many members of con
gress believe the Mississippi Choc
laws should be dealt with, they are
opposed to tampering with the citi
zenship rolls.
Action on the per capita item was
delayed until Monday, owing" to the
absence of Senator La Follette, who
has opposed payments to the Indians
and favored reoponing the Choctaw
and Chickasaw rolls.
Senator Owen will draft an amend
ment for the bill, which would re
move every competent Indian from
the restricted class. There are 3T.,00i
restricted Indians in Oklahoma, and
the Indian office reports but few of
them would be subject to the transfer.
Senator Owen said if it was thought
best to retain control of their prop
erty, the Indians ought to be given
their money.
