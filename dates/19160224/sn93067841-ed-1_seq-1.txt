and in the dining room yellow predominated.
The bride's table was
outlined with yellow daffodils, and a
huge basket in the center was filled
to overflowing with the same flowers,
the choicest of the Edgefield gardens
at this season. The shade over the
plectrolier was a yellow shower effect,
shedding the soft light about
the room. After the guests' arrival
they were entertained with several
musical numbers. Then, - to the
strains of Mendelssohn's wedding
march, the bridal party descended
from the upper hall in the following
order: First the flower girls, Katherine

from various parts of the State. A
buffet luncheon was served by old
* i 1 :
family servants, ionowsa uy ice
cream and cake, the color scheme,
yellow and white, being reflected in
the cream.
Clad in a rich gown of white satin
with train, the bride never appeared
more beautiful than she did on this
occasion. The grace of her slender
form was heightened by the conventional
veil. Later in the evening she
donned a handsome traveling suit
ready for the departure upon their
wedding journey of several weeks in
New York and other Northern cities.
Among the guests were: Mr P G
Gourdin and Miss Martha Gourdin !

concourse of sorrowing friends and
relatives attended the funeral of Mr
Thomas A McCrea at Cedar Grove
Baptist church Friday afternoon. Mr
McCrea, who had reached the age of
52 years, by his perseverance, energy
and strictly business principles
and a predominantly honest character
had accumulated enough earthly
property to live at ease tne remainder
of an ordinary life when the
grim reaper, death, summoned him
to his future home. He leaves a
widow, eight children, one brother,
Mr W A McCrea, one sister, Mrs
Sallie Brown, two half-brothers,
Messrs S T and J V Brown, and two
half-sisters, Mesdames Ben McClary
and Sylvester Mitchum.to mourn his
death.

KILLED IN JACKSONVILLE.
J VV Plowden Victim of Collision
of Auto and Street Car.
J W Plowden, a native of South
Carolina, who was traveling salesman
out of Charleston, for the Carolina
Portland Cement Company, of
that city, died in Jacksonville, Fla,
Sunday as the result of injuries re
ceived in an automobile accident in
the Florida metropolis Saturday night
According to an account of the
accident in a Jacksonville newspaper
of Sunday, Mr Plowden was riding
in an automobile with Miss Bessie
Bent, stenographer for a law firm un
in Jacksonville, when their machine
crashed into a trolley car. George
Frierson, a negro, who it is alleged
j was the chauffeur, but who denied
! that he was, was also injured.
Both Mr Plowden and Miss Bent
j were taken to a hospital, the former
suffering from a fractured skull,
and the young woman from injuries
about the shoulders and jaw. The j
condition, of both, the Jacksonville j
paper said, was pronounced serious.
Sunday a telegram was received by
a Charleston friend, stating that Mr
Plowden had died and that his remains
had been shipped to his home
in Atlanta for burial. He is survived
by a widow, who was Miss
Lila Mouzon of this county, and six
children. He was about thirty-eight
years old. I
Mr Plowden was a nephew of Mr ! B
S A Nettles and had many warm I I
friends in Kinsrstree, by whom his |
untimely death is deeply mourned. I
