WIS OF ARIZONA WILL
LOSE $1700 THIS YEA
The framers of Arizona
will lose $1700 this year and
$3100 next year, according to
a recent ruling or the Attorney-General
in connection
with Senate Bill 34. Senate
Bill' 34, which was drafted for
the purpose of accepting the
provisions of the Federal
Smith-Lever Act, which pro
vides funds for co-operative
extension work in agriculture
and home economics in the
Staf: of Arizona, passed
through the hands of a com
mittee in the last State Leg
islature an demerged from it
changed in two important
particulars. The intent of
this bill was to meet the in
crease in the Federal Smith
Lever fund, which is automa
tic each year providing the
State appropriate an equal
amount. For the year 1915
15 the State of Arizona was
supposed to provide the sum
of $1715.47, and the follow
ing year and everv vear there-'
after this fund is increased by
$1,429.56 until the year 1921,
when no further increases
are made but the final sum
-continues to be distributed i
annually. The Attorney-General
states that this bill is so
worded that mention of this
appropriation was omitted in
the title, hence causing it to
carry no appropriation. The
other undesirable feature of
this bill which was changed
by the legislative committee
was making the amount of
money which could be leg
ally appropriated by counties
for helpin gdefray the ex
penses of county farm advi
sors, $1,000. In several in
stances this is greatly handi
capping this line of work,
wnich is proving so benefi
cial to the agriculture- of the
State.
The loss of the anticipated
$1,700 for this year and the
additional sum for next year
is a serious one to the far
mers of the State. The Agri
cultural extension Service,
through which these funds
are expended, is carrying on
this work entirely for the
benefit of the farmers and at
their request, and is at pres
ent unable to meet the con
stant demands of the farmers
for information, advice and
assistance. If the farmers of
the State wish the agircultur
al extension work carired on
so as to meet their require
ments, they Will have to see
to it that the next legisla
ture provides ample funds for
this work.

FOUND IN KITCHEN;
STABBED THRU NECK
(By B. F. Fly)
Death laid its icy hand on
one of the best known citi
zens of Yuma last night,
when- Jose Mendevil was
called to his final rest. Just
what , his age was no one
knows, for he never knew
himself, nor did he ever
know who his mother and
father were, never having
had any recollection of hav
ing seen either.
It is certain, however, that
he was well past 70 years of
age, having spent the better
part of the last fortv-odd
years here in Yuma.
1 he story of his strand
ife reads like a novel.
Indeed it would take several novels
to tell of his career. The first that
he learned of civilization was when
he was captured by Gen. Cook's
troops when they captured a band of
savages from Mexico.
Joe could speak no other than the
Indian tongue, intermixed with Mexi
can. Interpreters ascertained that he
was not really one of the tribe, but
that he had been captured by them
when an infant, his father and mother
having been killed at that time. Just
how many years he was with this
tribe he had no way of telling, except
that he was in captivity many, many
I years.
In due course of time he became
I a valuable adjunct to Gen. Cook's
troops, but finally drifted into civilian
life.
J In this latter capacity he was al
i ways known as a hard worker at what
ever he undertook, nor did it matter
i with him what kind of work he eng
gaged in, so long as it was honest,
' hard work. He lived at various times
in the larger cities of California, such
, as Los Angeles, San Diego and San
Francisco; but he always considered
I Yuma his home.
I Here he was known sa a man of
j sterling character, whose word was as
good as the bond of a bank. Honesty
was his guiding star. No man ever
knew Joe Mandevil to be deceitful
! or to misrepresent the facts.
In the later vears of his iff a Tip nl.
ways expected to "strike -it rich'1 in
his mine near Picaohn. hut Tip diHnv
j live long enough to see his dream
The tales he used to tell his many
friends of what occurred when he was
in captivity with the Indians In Mexi
; co were calculated to make one's hair
, stand on end, and those who knew
him best never doubted the absolute
correctness of his narratives.
But poor old Joe Is gone. His
friends deeply mourn his death, and
here in Yuma that means everybody
who knew him.
Peace to his ashes.
Several sons survive and will be
present at the funeral which will take
place tomorrow.

EL PASO, Feb. 25. Francisco Villa
I today burned several houses at San
( Buenaventura, and then occupied El
j Valle, according to official reports re-
ceived by General Gavira, the Carran-
za commandant at Juarea.
1 A passenger train was wrecked at
Santa Sofia, Chihuahua.
J. H. McCormick, who with a part
ner named Halpin, has been stoppin
for the past week with Sheriff Green-
lead, had two trials before Judge J. C
Jones this morning, and was stuck in
each case.
McCormick and Halpin are the two
individuals who last week reached
Yuma with a Ford jitney loaded with
whiskey. They had a falling out, the
result being that McCormick dumped
all the whiskey out on the sidewalk,
notified the officers where it was and
then went back to the Bard side of
the river,( where he camped all night
at Billy Horn's camp, left there the
next day when Billy was absent, and
on the next day was caught by Sheriff
Greenleaf at Done.
When the jitney was searched, in
stead of finding a "blind pig," the
sheriff fonud a dead pig that was so
oderiferous that he and the Dome con
stable rolled it into the Gila river, but
not until McCormick had said Billy
Horn had given it to him.
In the case against him this morn
ing, wherein he was charged with
having brought whiskey into the state
for other than "personal use." he was
very prompetly held to the superior
court in $400 bonds.
Then came the charge of having
brought stolen property into the slate.
Billy Horn was on hand and testified
that he had neither given, sold nor
exchanged the pig to McCormick. The
defendant, noting that Judge Jones
was about to hold him guilty on this
charge also, asked to be allowed to
tell all about the pig. He was listen
ed to with interest; but his story
sounded so "fishy" that everybody
had to smile. The more he talked
the more he wound a web of guilt
about himself.
But, to cap the climax, he swore
he had just that day received a tele
gram from a friend in Ajo advising
him to come there at once to protect
his mining claim. It was difficult for
him to remember his friend's name,
but he finally did so. He had torn
up the telegram, "however. The court
took a recess long enough to get Mgr.
Dave Inman of the Western Union to
appear with his record. This proved
that McCormick had not received any
such telegram. And that settled his
hash. He had said, he was taking the
undressed pig to Ajo because "fresh
meat is scarce in Ajo," and the reason
why he had not cleaned the pig was
because he didn't want to "mess up";
tiie jitney, under the rear seat of I
which the sheriff found the dead ani-'
mal. i i
McCormick didn't have a word to I
say when Judge Jones pronounced '
him guilty and gave him 90 days or
90 dollars.
