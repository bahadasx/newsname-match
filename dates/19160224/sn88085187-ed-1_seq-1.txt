ATTACK TRAIN IN TACOMA YARDS
Diva or Vaudeville
Star: Which, Think
You Has It Right?
By Edgar
Have we Americans drifted to
a point where we fail to take life
seriously?
Hsve we forgotten our homes
and firesides, our interest In
higher arts and sciences to revel
in one grand roughhouae of low
brow pleasure and jituey enjoy
<ment?
Grace Cameron, looking out at
her audiences night after night
from behind the footlights, says
we have.
Opera to Vaudeville
Grace, as a girl of 17, found
herself endowed with a beauti
• ful voice. She spent thousands
of dollars training It. By hard
work she became an opera singer
and one of a circle of distin
guished eastern artists and mus
icians.
She began to see a realization
t of her dreams of highest artistic
'triumphs.
Today she Is delighting her au
diences at Pantages theater with
hilarious rough and tumble
stunts.
Just Wistful
She puts her act across by
staging a "take off" of heavy
grand opera and Willie Shakes
.penre tragedy stuff, the stuff
that her girlhood dreams were
made of. She bounces around
on a mild rampage of heavy death
scenes.
And she gets hy. The audi
ence laughs.
"I had to do it? I had to drift
along with my audiences and give
them what they wanted. I had
to make my living," she says.
But she's not hitter about It;
only a little wistful
"I'm just like a rubber hall.
You can't keep me still. And if
the audiences want me to raise
the ceiling rather than have me
.sing them sweet little songs, why
not give them what they want?
It's good fun, anyway," she adds.
Sees (treat Change
From her place behind the
footlights, she says she has seen
a remarkable change come over
IT. S. people in the last five years.
And she's in a position to know.
"Only a short time ago mjff au
diences were delighted when I
sang some simple, artistic song.
•Now such a song falls flat.
"Nobody is serious any more.
What people want nowadays is
excitement and fun.
Women in Cafes
"Our women have forgotten
about their homes and firesides.
Every evening, from 5 to 7 you
* can see them in the cafes, instead.
If I were their husbands, I'd
want them to come home.
"And so gradually ln the last
few years the demands of audi
ences have forced me to drift
from grand opera to musical com
edy, then to high price vaude
ville and now finally to the low
briced vaudeville.
"There Is no telling where the
end will be.
Seriousness Back Number
"But I'm not kicking. I'm
earning a living. The halls of
grand opera are empty. High price
vaudeville houses have closed
their, doors.
■■ "Today hundreds of musicians
and artists are walking the streets
of New York, just because they
think they're too good to drift
along, satisfying the demands of
modern audiences.
"Seriousness is a back number
ln America."

Never before have Americans
been so serious as they are today.
Never before have they shown
such keen appreciation of the
highest forms of serious art.
Never before have audiences
listened with such intelligent un
derstanding to the best there Is
in music.
Emmy Destlnn, prima donna of
the grand opera, known to the
world as probably its greatest
dramatic soprano, said today that
since she came to the U. S. seven
years ago she has seen Americans
take big strides in seriousness.
Will Heroine Citizen.
And to show that she means it,
she expects to become a full
fledged U. S. citizen next year.
She took out her first papers two
years ago and is only awaiting the
time for the second to arrive.
We wish to apologize to
madame for calling her a prima
donna. She despises the name,
she says.
Anything in the way of "tem
peramental" or "flashy" prima
donnism doesn't go with her.
She's an all-round good Ameri
can fellow and loves America.
She says this "temperamental"
stuff usually is nothing more than
plain "temper."
Want Heal Art.
"It was not many years ago
that ■ fellow with mediocre abil
ity could let his hair grow, put
on a 'temperament,' acquire a
good advertising manager and get
away with it," she said this morn
ing at the Tacoma hotel.
"But that kind of stuff doesn't
go with American audiences any
more. They have no use for
sham. They want real art and
real artists, or they don't want
any at all.
"This to me Is one of the must
convincing signs of growing
American seriousness."
The fact that it has been a bad
season for grand opera managers
is no sign that serious American
interest is lagging, she declared.
"The truth is that the mana
gers have been unable to get the
singers. And without the best
artists they cannot draw their
audiences.
Why She'll Become Yankee.
"I myslf like the concert work
better than grand opera because
there Is more chance to assert my
own individuality. I don't like
the paint and powder and cos
tumes which are destroyers of in
dividuality."
"Why do I want to become a
IT. S. citizen? In the first place,
because we foreigners should not
come to America, make our
money here and then de_ert
America. In the second place,
because 1 find Americans appreci
ate the best things.
"And then, Just because I love
America."

Mystery in
. Attempt
On Slavic
Munition
Carrier
Sam Rusky, age 2.1, and John
Ross, age 23, both Austrians, arc
held incommunicado at the TacQ
nia city jail today, and officers
are scouring the city for 15 other
Austrians, as the result of a bold
attack made at 7:30 o'clock this
morning on a Great Northern
train, loaded with war munitions,
as it passed through the Tacoma
yards.
Although extreme secrecy has
been maintained about the attack,
railroad officials admit that a
gang succeeded in cutting an air
hose connection between two cars,
thus effectively stopping the trait,
as it was aproaching the 15th
street viaduct.
iiiiu<i-i<<-li:iiifl Buttle.
Railroad trainmen rushed on
the group just as the men were
boarding the stalled train.
A hand-to-hand battle followed,
resulting in the trainmen's cap
turing Rusky and Ross.
The other men, estimated to
number at least 15, made their
escape.
The prisoners were turned over
to Policeman Mines, and taken to
jail.
They were roughly dressed, but
unarmed. Both spoke English.
The freight had come from the
east, and contained several cars of
automobiles consigned to the
Russian army, to be delivered at
Vladivostok, and a number of oth
er cars said to contain clothing
and other munitions.
Great Secrecy Observed.
Tlie train was bound for Seat
tle. Because of the Great North
ern's traffic difficulties in tho
Cascade mountains, the heavy
freight had been detoured via
Spokane and Vancouver, Wash.
The munitions were to be dis
charged into steamers ol the Hill
line.
Railroad detectives, with Ta
coma city detectives, are working
secretly on the case.
No one has been allowed to in
terview or even see the two
Austrians.
Looking for Others.
"All we can say now is that the
attack was made," said Special
Agent Montgomery of the North
ern Pacific detective department.
"We do not know whether the
group of men intended to dyna
mite the train or planned to beat
off the trainmen and take posses
sion of the cars. All we know is
that these two men are in jail and
we are looking for the others."
The train was reported later to
have arrived safely at Smith's
Cove.

Letters On Decollete!
C'Editor The Times: ln one of
yiour interesting articles on decol
lete gowns you say that you know
of cases where girls in restaurants
and ice cream parlors lost their
jobs because they refused to dress
more modestly.
Well, I wouldn't doubt your
word, but let me tell you, Mr.
Editor', that 1 know of other girls
—several of them —who have
beep FIUED from their jobs be
cause they wouldn't expose as
much of their persons as their
employers wanted them to.
And I think you are familiar
enough with what is going on In
Tacoma so that you won't doubt
my word on that either.
A WORKING GIRL.
A NEW PROPOSAL
J__ a{ Editor The Times: Opin
ions appear to agree that the
question of lowness or highness
of women's dress depends a good
deal on what we're accustomed to.
Arlsa, that the only possible im
moral effect of "the descending
ffepths of the decollete" would lie
In their suggestlvenesa—in what
tljejr conceal to the imaginations
ot tha evil-minded, rather than
In what they actually expose to
view.
If all this la true, why not set
tle the whole question by having
a decree Issued that all women's
gowns ahall be worn beginning
from the waist down, at least dur
ing the warm months of the year?
la winter, no gowns lower than
the Adam's apple?
Once accustomed to this Btyl°,
I believe the judges of women's
dress would find no cause of com
plaining against American im
morality iv dress.
Of course there would have to
be a rule against any form of
decollete sklrta.
