.and from some cause the letter
was delayed and was not receiv
ved until the day after our arrival
there. Nevertheless we had the
priviledge of talking to several,
and we ujust say that our labors

Sister Mattie a Martha great;
All you, I would love to greet.
The shoes and tacks are very good,

And we are. cutting wood;
We go thru mud and wind and storm:
And we write Creation and Formation good.
The Cresset will come regular out,
And good tiJings bring to all:
The Ed's- shoes are very stout;
Our friends they answered the call;
And our feet are warm.
