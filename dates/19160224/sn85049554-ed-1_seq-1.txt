f, .••• No -Reply From Germany.
Germany has not yet replied to the
lateBt request from Washington that
previous-assurances (or the safety of
unresisting liners apply to the conduct
of the new submarine- campaign.
She has indicated she wants to dis
cuss what properly may be defensive
armament.
There are indications in Germany
that the consequence of more deatruc-_
tion of American lives is fully realized.
Private dispatches tell how the civil
ian element of Germany, headed by the
chancellor, Von -.Bethmann-Hollweg,
which has contended ftfr preserving
friendly .^.relations with the United
States has been overshadowed by a
new political force headed by Baron
von Falkenhayn, chief of the staff of
the army, who has Emperor William's
fullest confidence. Von Falkenhayn, it
is said, does not consider that a break
with the United States would affect
Germany's success in the war.
These views are understood to have
been communicated to President Wil
son.
Situation Calming Dowft.
As mefrrb^rs of both houses assem
bled the stiuation appeared to have
calmed considerably. The exact status
of the stiuation was as follows:
Many members of tho house and
some in the senate, being much in the

and carrying 206 prisoners taken from
various vessels captured by a German

received today in a message from
Santa Orusl After landing their pris

put to sea again in the West'burn and,
sank their prise, the message staled.
Advices received last night from
Santa Cruz stated that the British

had put in there for repairs, flying the
German flag and with a German prize
crew of one officer and seven men
