Honesty and Efficiency by the
Municipal Voters League.
i)n this coming Tuesday April 4th,
:ir our o'clock the aldermanic election
m Hn various wards throughout the
i-iH will -wind up or come to a close,
in 'ii.iny of the wards the fight between
tin . (intending candidates has been
.r bitter and will continue to be so
until the polls close on that date.
Mayor "William Hale Thompson, just
to s-how that he is still on eath and
is still to do some political fighting has
on the home stretch jumped or plunged
headlong into the contest in an effort
to defeat or punish some of the alder
men who have in the past bitterly
fought him, whom ho regards as his
deadly enemies in the City Council.
It remains to be seen whether or not
his Honor the Mayor will succeed in
routing his political enemies if he does
then he will have the Hon. Charles S.
Deneen and his forces on the dead run
and they will be forced to run so fact
that they will not be able to stop run
umg and land anywhere on Tuesday,
.jinl 11, and Mayor Thompson very
jinlly proclaims it from the house tops
tkt "he is still in the saddle and be
iii mounted on the lucky or the win
ning horM, that he will ride rough
shod over the Hon. Charles S. Deneen
and Ins rebel army and drive him and
them off the face of the earth."
As the old Colored man once said:
"-o moiit it be so if the good Lord
in the high heavens is willing."
A Merman Hugh Norris and his many
friends and supporters are more than
confident that for the third time he
will be returned to the City Council
from the second ward; Alderman Nor
ris is a member of the Judiciary, Lo
cal Industries, License and several
other committees of the City Council
and without any noise or fuss or feath
0fs he is always hustling around the
city hall in the interest of the White
and Colored citizens hailing from the
Second Ward, if it is possible for him
to do any favors for any one he has
never been known to draw the color
line nor to raiso the race issue which
greatly to his credit; it must further
bo said to the credit of Alderman Nor
tls that he turns many "good tricks for
mjny of his deserving constituents
which never comes to the light of day
fnd in which the general public is not
interested.
That clas 0f voters in the Second
ard who cannot see their way clear
Voto for Alderman Norris, should
Jr y to th support of Harry Hiiareth,
00 is a first elnsn (iim'nuM man.
U ton0rabl0 cntcrPrisinS citizen, who
resent all the people in the Second
Ward in the City Council.
Alderman Thomas A. Doyle, who has
been highly commended by the Muni
cipal Voters League will and should be
returned to the City Council from the
Fifth Ward, by all of its voters regard
less of their politics; for Alderman
Doyle is full of life and is one of the
youngest and best Alderman to be
found in any part of Chicago.
Alderman Joseph Higgins Smith who
is one of the very best friends that the
Colored -people have ever had in the
City Council and all the Colored voters
residing in the 14th Ward should on
Tuesday, April 4th, assist to boost him
back into it.
Alderman William J. Healy is slated
to be returned to the city council from
the 18th Ward for with a the business
men and his solid army of friends push
ing him along he must and will not be
permitted to fall by the wayside.
It goes without saying that Aldermen
John A. Richert; Henry P. Bergen, Wil
liam E. O 'Toole and John Toman, will
all come in under the wire far ahead
of their rivals and be re-elected to the
City Council on Tuesday, April 4th,
from their respective wards.
Lawyer Augustus L. Williams, is still
fighting to be elected one ofthe dele
gates to the Republican National Con
vention, June 7, from the first Congres
sional district of Illinois.
Mr. Williams states that many Col
ored Republicans, as well as White
ones, have come out in the open and
boldly declared their adherence to him
and that they will stand by him until
the polls close, Tuesday, April 11.
The thing that greatly surprised
many of the wise politicians this week
around the city hall was that the
Municipal Voters' League came out
flat-footed and indorsed Harry Hildreth,
Jr., for alderman of the Second Ward,
and Rev. John P. Thomas, Pastor of the
Ebenezer Baptist Church, 35th and
Dearborn streets, who is an honored
member of the Grand Army of the
Republic, who bravely fought in the
War of the Rebellion, has also wheeled
in line for Mr. Hildreth for Alderman
of that ward, and Rev. Thomas states
that in his opinion "ho is the very best
man that could bo trotted out for that
position, that ho does not know how
the majority of the Colored men and
women in that ward will voto on Tues
day, April 4th, but as far as he is con
cerned he will cast his vote in favor
The leading citizens of the eighteenth
ward, both Democrats and Republicans,
are and will continue to work awfully
hard from now until the polls close on
Tuesday evening for the re-election of
Alderman William J. Healy to the city
council from that ward.
His many friends and supporters in
sist that the honor of the ward demands
that an Alderman with the conspic
uously good record of Alderman Healy
should be returned to the Council. Busi
ness men, big and little, professional
men, active politicians and citizens in
general have interested themselves in
the campaign of the Republican Alder
man who is Tunning in a Democratic
ward. For eight years Alderman Healy
has won over Democratic odds in the
ward, and his friends arc convinced
that he will do the same thing this year.
Following are some of the Alder
man's achievements that his citizen
supporters are pointing to in arguing
that he should be re-elected:
Alderman Healy was on the sub-committee
which drew the surface lin uni
fication ordinance.
He is the author of the universal
transfer section of the surface line uni
fication ordinance.
He headed the subcommittee which
drew the elevated railroads' unification
ordinance.
He was a member of the Council com
mittee which helped settle the street
car strike and secured for the men the
big increase in pay.
Protects Streets.
He is chairman of the committee on
municipal improvements which is now
directing the building in Canal street
of the first subway gallefy for pipe and
conduits of public utilities which will
make unnecessary the tearng up of
streets.
He s chairman of the Committee on
Streets and Alleys, which abolished
duplicate and confusing street names.
He was acting chairman of the rail
way terminals committee at the time
the Union Depot ordinance was passed
an ordinance which this year will
give work to 20,000 men, a large num
ber of them hailing from the Eight
eenth Ward.
As chairman of the committee on
streets and alleys he called up and
caused to be passed by the Council last
.. s
ALDEEMAN JOSEPH HIGGINS SMITH.
The peoples candidate for re-election to the city council from the 14th ward.
Julius P. Taylor, Editor of The Broad
Ax, please allow me space in your fear
less and valuable paper, I want to turn
the light on the Aldermanic question.
There is an Alderman to be elected in
the 14th Ward. Our present Alderman
Joseph Higgins Smith stands for
justice. His opponent is a Ken
tuckian, with his parents living in
Kentucky. Wouldn't it. be a question
in your mind whether he would give
the black man justice. Has the light
been turned on to see whether he is a
lilly white Republican or not. We must
use our ballot as our gun in order to
move all obstacles that stand in our
way, so after a careful consideration
it is best not to change the old for the
new. We don't want Kentucky ideas
drafted into Illinois. Let's rally as
men to that faithful servant who has
been so loyal to us. With his open door
and return him to the Council with the
largest majority of any Alderman ever
sent to the Council from tho 14th Ward.
Our neighbor and our friend, Alderman
Joseph Higgins Smith.
Yours respectfully,
Samuel S. Taylor,
1728 Pulton street.

In an article headed "Pythians Will
Not Endorse Segregation," the Chicago
Defender, of March 18, publishes a
series of the most infamous fabrica
tions ever perpetratefTon any city. The
article refers to St. Louis segregation
and is so maliciously absurd that its
reproduction in whole would be only
adding insult to injury. The communi
cation appears to be written by the
Defender's St. Louis correspondent and
says Supreme Chancellor S. W. Green
will call off the Supreme Lodge 1917
meeting of the K. of P. because race
leaders will not journey to this city
where they are shut off from civiliza
tion. To make the article odious the
writer says, "Since this law of segre
gation, has. passed, Negroes have not
been permitted to go outside of their
district unless policemen have their
eyes on themj" "have one rear seat
in street cars;" "have a line limit
after 9 p. m.;" and mentions terrible
punishments for violations. The article
closes by appealing to Chancellor Green
to do his duty and save the Pythians
from such a place.
Of course, everyone in St. Louis, and
every sensible person anywhere else,
knows that these statements are all
pure lies. Segregation is not yet in
force here and may never be. There
is no Jim Crow, no curfew, in fact St.
Louis today is tho St. Louis of old.
Thousands of dollars have been sub
scribed by the whites to entertain the
Pythians and a royal reception will be
the effect. The Defender has fallen
entirely off the pinnacle of modern
journalism in permitting so base an
article to disgrace its columns. The
Argus, St. Louis, Mo., March 25th,
