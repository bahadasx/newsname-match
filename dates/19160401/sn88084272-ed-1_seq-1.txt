Gen. George Bell, commanding the

naturally elated over the wonderful
drive made by the Seventh cavalry after
Villa. Commenting -upon the fact that
the horsemen had gone over a cir
cuitous route of more than (0 miles in
17 hours, the average per mile, he
stated. Inclusive of the rests, was five
miles an hour.
A Great Cavalry JUdc.
The general thought it a great ride
by the American cavalry, who started
six and a half days behind Villa, known
himself as a hard rider., and overtook
him in exactly two weeks. Villa raided
Columbus on the morning of Thursday,
March ' and the American troops did
not take the field until noon of the fol
lowing Wednesda Two weeks later
the or er took and de'feated him in bat
tle, although he is reported to have
traveled very fast.
Asked what would be done if Villa
should be wounded and hide out In the
mountains. Gen Bell straightened up
and with determination said "We have
gone down after tlla and have no in
tention of coming out until we have
him, lock, stock and barrel
lilla -"t In Fight.
"From the many confirmations of ths
fact that he was wounded, I feel confi
dent that he had no share in the fight
Wednesday morning It is interesting
to knovy that the Vtllistaa did not know
that our troops were so near We have
wanted to locate the bandits and now
that wo have, the rest will not be a dif
ficult matter to solve "
The general took considerable inter
est in discussing the engagement, but
stated positively he would not antici
pate any army move in advance, as the
information, was often used to tae em
barrassment of the troop movements.

Americans acquainted with the coun
try predicted Frlda night that Villa
would head southwest towards San An

ride on horseback The mountains in
every other direction, it la declared, are
too rough to permit of a carriage be

The road to San Andres would permit
of the movement of a carriage. Tho
