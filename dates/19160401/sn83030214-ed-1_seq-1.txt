Cotonel Dodd'a troopen gwooped down on Villa's main force it
Guerrero at dawn yeaterday. The flying column, made up of
400 pickod men of tho 7th Cavalry, attacked the 600 bandits.
Taken completely by Burpriao, th?i Mexkaiu made ? biitf
stand and then broko from the town. A running fight for ten
miles followed. The ViUiatai left thirty dead in their tracks, in
cluding their command^r, General Kliseo Hernandez. They car
lied away more doad and many wounded.
Only four Americans were wounded, nonc of them seri
ously.
Yilla himeelf was not present at the fiprht. With n broken
leg and a wound in the hip, he was fleeing ovcr rough mountain
trails in a light carriage. Dodd's men arc pressing hard after
him.
Many prisoners were taken by Colonel Dodd's troopers
[and several Carranzistas who were being held by V'illa pending
execution were releaaed by the Amerirans.
Defeat of the Villistas followed a surprise attack. Rush
ing their horses over fifty-five miles of mountain trail in seven
teen hours. the Americans camo upon the outlaws botwoan <>
! and 7 o'elock Wcdnesday morning. The advance guard had
paased tho enemy outposts before they were diecovered.
Panic struck the camp of the outlaws. They fought had-.
desperately for a time, but the accuracy of the American rifle
fire prevailod.
Within anhourthebands were in flight, and for five hours
a running fight kept up,
By noon the Villista defeat was a rompleto rout. Casting
away rifles, cartridge belts and provisions and abandoning two
of their machine guns the bandits Kattered in mad flight to the
mountains.
