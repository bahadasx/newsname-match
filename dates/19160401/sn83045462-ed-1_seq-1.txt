shifted the point of his attack i
upon Verdun, delivering an cffectixe
blow to the northeast of
ihc stronghold, gaining a footing
in the village of Yaux. and thawing
the net still closer about the
fortress.
German artillery continued to
deluge the French positions with
shells in the region of Malanct
>urt.
German forces delivered two heavy
attacks last night east of the Meuse.
The French war office admits that one
rtack gained the Germans a footing
in the village of Vaux. The other
attack was repulsed, says Paris.
Teutons Driven Back.
The Germans, in a fierce attack on
French positions northeast of hill 295
in the Le Mort Homme region, some
three miles east of Malancourt, early
yesterday gained a footing in some of
the French first line trenches, but were
immediately driven out in a vigorous
counter attack, according to the French
official communication issued last evening.
The Germans have made no attempt
to debouch from Malancourt,
which they hold.
French Communication.
The text of today's communication
follows:
"North.of the River Aisne there has
been considerable activity on the part
or the opposing artillery forces in the
vicinity of Moulin-Sous-Touvent and
Fontenoy.
"In the Argonne district we have directed
a destructive fire on the highways
and railroad lines of the enemy
to the north of Haute Chevauchee.
"West of the Meuse there has been
an intermittent bombardment In the
region of Malancourt. but without any
infantry engagements.
Bombardment Violent.
East of the Meuse the bombardment
became exceedingly violent yesterday
evening and last night along the sector
between the wood south of Haudremont
and the region of Vaux. Against
this latter point the Germans delivered
two sudden attacks, in which large
numbers of men took part. The first,
from both the north and the south at
the same time, was checked by our cur- |
lain of fire and the fire of our infantry
before it could get as far as our lines. I
"During the course of the second at- I
tack, the enemy, after a very spirited
fight, was able to secure a footing in
i he western part of the village of Vaux,
occupied by our forces.
"In the W'oevre district there has been
oine active artillery firing against the
villages at the base of the heights of
the Meuse.
From the rest of the front there is
nothing to report."

ZEPPELIN RAIDER .
SEIZED BY BRITISH
Airship Comes Down Off
Thames Estuary and Surrenders
to Patrol Boat.
NINETY BOMBS DROPPED
IN NIGHT EXPEDITION
Five Aerial Craft Are Believed to
Have Participated?Results
Not Fully Known.
LONDON. April 1.?One <?f five Zeppelins
which visited the eastern counties
of England during the night, dropping
some ninety bombs, was damaged,
presumably by British anti-aircraft
guns, ami came down off the Thames
estuary. It surrendered to British patrol
boats. The crew was saved, but
the airship broke up and sank while
being towed in.
Twenty-eight persons were killed
and forty-four injured in last night's
air raid, according to official figures
given but today.
The raid of last night was the twenty-second
of the war. The lost Zep
pelin was the third of her class 10
come to grief in these raids. The official
statement says:
"During the night a damaged Zeppelin
was observed to come down off the
Thames estuary. On being approached
by one of our patrol boats she surrendered.
The crew was taken off her
and she was taken in tow, but she subsequently
broke up and sank."
Ninety Bombs Dropped.
Five Zeppelin airships participated
in the raid. Thus far it has been ascertained
that about ninety bombs
were dropped by the invaders. An official
statement regarding the raid
says:
"An air raid took place last night
over the eastern counties in which
five Zeppelins are believed to have
taken part. All the raiders crossed the
coast at different places and times,
and steered different courses.
"At present about ninety bombs are
reported to have been dropped in various
localities in the eastern counties,
but the results are not known.
"It is further reported that hostile
aircraft visited the northeast coast, but
no details have yet been received."
Advance Signs of Raid.
Although no formal warning was issued
to the population, the usual signs
of an approaching air raids were manifested
in London by the calling out of
special constables, by the darkening
of the streets and by the stopping of
train service above ground. Even the
omnibuses and street cars in many sections
either discontinued service or ran
in a limited way. Thousands of persons
were unable to reach their homes, and
for the greater part of the night the
police stations were crowded with wayfarers
seeking shelter.
Weather Fine and Clear.
An exceptional feature of the raid
was the fact that the weather was fine
and clear: there was no moon, but the

TODAY FROM THE BORDER

Satisfaction bordering on iubi!
lation. describes the mood of
I army and administration officials
today, following the receipt yesterday
of news of the defeat of
Villa forces by Col. Dodd and the
advance guard of United States
] cavalrymen. Officials today
i awaited report of the actual capture
of Villa, and word to that
effect was expected momentarily.
May Now Be Prisoner.
It is possible that before this time
Col. Dodd and his cavalrymen have
trapped the bandit. It was pointed out
that the news of the actual fight with
Villa bandits did not reach "Washington
until two days after the fight.
The War Department had no further
advices today on 4*Dodd's dash" at
Guerrero. It was said that it frequently
happens that the department
receives nothing from the border for
three or four days.
Secretary Baker expressed anxiety to
learn the names and condition of the
four privates reported slightly wounded
in the clash at Guerrero.
Border rumors that Carranza troops
were massing opposite Douglas. Ariz.,
were without confirmation at the War
stars were bright. Toward midnight a
.slight haze came up. but it was not
sufficient to obscure the landscape
from the view of aviators or anti-aircraft
gunners. It was such a night as
the experts thought would oblige the
airships to keep at a very high altitude,
if they hoped to escape damage.
The handling of precautionary measures
in London worked more smoothly
than ever before, showing that the machinery
for the protection of the metropolis
was in efficient shape. Small
crowds in the streets watched the skies
in a quiet, expectant manner.
At 9:30 p.m. one Zeppelin was reported
seen over London, traveling
slowly at a great, height. A telegram
from a correspondent on the east coast
said that a Zeppelin was seen soon
after 9 o'clock sailing in a northeasterly
direction.
Guns Fire on Raider.
An eyewitness of a Zeppelin in flight
and its encounter with anti-aircraft
guns describes the scene as a most
thrilling one. The Zeppelin, which appeared
to be of a larger type than that
of previous visitors, flew at a considerable
height. The glitter of Its
surface as it passed overhead attracted
the attention of hundreds of persons,
who came out of doors to gaze
upward despite the instructions given
to remain under cover.
rne searcnjignts mat played on the
raider illuminated it effectively and
shells from the guns that opened fire
could be seen bursting all around it.
One gunner claimed that he had secured
a hit. the Zeppelin thereupon
being seen to turn about and proceed
toward the coast, apparently damaged.
REPORT GERMANS CHECKED

Railroad Situation Unchanged.
Officials still are unadvised of progress
toward commercial use of the
Mexican Northwestern railway by Gen.
Funston. The general has not reported
since advising the department
that Gen. Gavira, Carranza commander
at Juarez, was awaiting instructions
from Gen. Carranza ratifying the commercial
shljyping arrangement proposed.
The last instructions, to. Gen.
Funston were to tender supply shipments
to the railroad authorities. ?
Navy Department dispatches today reported
conditions quiet at Vera Cruz,
Tampico, Puerto Mexico, and on the
Mexican west coast.
Sent to Fight Bandits.
A detachment of Mexican infantry has
been sent from Piedras Negras to Monclova
to operate against a small number
of bandits recently reported to have been
I active in that district, according to adI
vices received at the State Department
today from Ragle Pass. The bandits are
said to have been seen in the foothills
near Menclova.
"There has been no change iri the military
forces in the Piedras Negras district."
the 3?ate Department announcement
says, "and the situation there is
reported to be satisfactory."
Success Causes Satisfaction.
Word of the smashing bloty delivered
at the Villa raiders by United States
troops at Guerrero was received everywhere
with satisfaction. Congress
stopped business and cheered. President
Wilson sent congratulations to Secretary
Raker and the Secretary dispatched
congratulatory messages to
Maj. (Jen. Funston to be conveyed to
Brig. (Jen. Pershing and Col. Dodd.
Officials believe that Dodo's victory, if
followed by the capture or the death of
: Villa, would go far toward restoring peace
j in Mexico, because it would discourage
j outlaws generally and stop desertions
' from Carranza's army.
Statement by Secretary Baker.
Secretary Baker issued the following
statement on the subject:
"The success of Col. Dodd in catching
up with the retreating bandits and disI
persing them shows ihe value arid ef'
fectiveness of the careful preparation
! ma.lo V. iMlNUtni. si u uall u a tin. .loci.
and vigor with which Col. Dodd himself
and the members of his command have
| undertaken their task.
"It Is a matter of great satisfaction
to us all that the first encounter is so
I decisive and that our own troops have
J suffered so slightly. The effect on both
sides of the border will undoubtedly be
| good. It will allay apprehension on the
(American side 1>;. showing the rapidity
! and effectiveness with which our army
i act.", and among the Mexican people it
I will show the singleness of our purpose
i and discourage other bandits from sympathetic
demonstration.
Hope for Speedy Results.
I ' This comes as a very adequate
answer to those who feared that if
I would he a long and painful pursuit
[ before we overtook these marauders,
land gives strong ground to hope that
the entire object of the expedition can
be speedily accomplished."
The War Department was not advised
officially' regarding the troops in
Col. Podd's command, although the 7th.
10th and Kith Cavalry were understood
to be the nucleus of the column picked
for the raid. The 7th Cavalry is
famous as the regiment which was
| wiped out in the Custer massacre and
cut to pieces in the Wounded Knee affair
in 1801, the last of the big Indian
fights.
PROBLEMS IN MEXICO.
U. S. Debating as to Disposal of Captured
Men and Guns.
Official# of th#? War Department today
said it had not been settled what disposition
shall be made of the machine
guus. etc., captured b> Dodd's flying brigade
from the Villa forces in the tieroniiiio
engagement, but it is intimated in
some quarters that probably they will he
turned over to the representatives of the
de facto government, as Mexican property.
A more important problem which may
have to be solved before very long is
what shall be done with Villa and the
members of his marauding band in case
of capture. If turned over to the <*arranzaistas

executed.

iSTOP-WATCHSYSTEM
MAY CAUSE PROBE
Hint of Lobby in Fight Against
Tavenner Bill jor, It?
r
Abolition.
The Taylor stop-watch system, which
employes of the Washington navy yard
are opposing-, may become the center of
another little "Mulhall lobby investigation"
following the developments before
the House committee on labor today.
Representative Tavenner of Illinois,
author of the anti-Taylor system
bill, presented to the committee a
letter written by W. B. Richards, an
engineer of Xew York city, to John W.
Powell of 531 Harvard street northwest.
tlus city, in which an appeal for
funds to tight the Tavenner bill was
made.
"In view of the fact that this letter
states frankly that money is being collected
to fight this legislation," Representative
Tavenner said to the committee.
"and in view of the fact that the
National Association of Manufacturers
is interested in opposing the legislation:
also, in view of the fact that a
previous Congress saw fit to investigate
very thoroughly some of the methods
j of the National Association of Manufacturers.
I believe this committee
! should know what is being done with
the money thus collected."
. .lames A. Emery, counsel for the association
named, asked that W. B. Richards
be allowed to appear and answer
' an A charges that are made against him.
Members of the committee understand
that Mr. Richards, whose address is
j 43 Wall street. New York, will appear
| before them Tuesday.
Extract From the Letter.
The letter from W. B. Richards, appealing
for funds to fight the Tavenner
bill to prevent stop-watch speeding up
systems in government plants contained
the following paragraph:
"The next step planned by the proponents
of this legislation is an act to
j restrict the government officials from
| uuviiig any inaienais or supplies wnicn
' have been manufactured by any shop
i employing" modern effiicency methods."

who has been actively engaged for
several years past In the fight for the
Tavenner bill, appeared again before
the committee and gave a mass 'of details
concerning the way the Taylor
stop-watch system is viewed by all
classes of laboring men. v He said that
the War Department had fo^nd several
ways of evading the spirit of the law
against the use of speeding-up systems.
"The Taylor system," he said, "in its
every element is arranged to speed up
the workmen: it tends to the gradual
elimination of men who cannot stand
the pace. It is beside the question to
argue that this has not happened.
Dabor does not expect to wait for that
to happen. We propose to stop it be

The Tavenner btll has been ordered
reported to the Mouse, but has not
actually been reported.

he rode off in a carriage, or that he
was hiding in a cave of a mountain c
overlooking the battle between his men (
and those of Col. Dodd were character- *
i
ized at headquarters as guesses.
No report to Gen. Funston has stated
specifically just where he was on that

day nor where he is now. Even the ^
report that he is injured was not defl- f

Unofficial reports early today indi- a

his wounded condition. One of these
reports, which was from a Mexican
source, was thai he was uninjured and ^
that his own men had spread the report
of his broken leg in order to dis- ^
tract the attention of the Americans. a

The feverish excitement caused along: ^
the border by yesterday's news of Col.
Dodd's victory at San Geronimo ranch a
had far from subsided today. The fact
that three days have elapsed since the in
smashing: blow delivered at the Villa tc
band in the valley of thp Santa Maria A
without any further news from Gen.
Pershing has given birth to the most
extravagant speculation and rumors. ,
The chief argument of the pessimists
is that if Villa was as desperately injured
as reported he should by now be ta
in the hands of his pursuers. But the M
optimists retort by pointing out the
wild character of the country in which
he is hiding and the fact that most of m
the natives of the mountains are sure th
to do all they can to baffle the Amer- v

Everything apparently depends upon j

o seek safety in the mountains of the
iivide it is believed that he cannot escape
capture, although he may elude
lis enemies for many days yet. On the

to have reached a country where travding
is comparatively easy, water a*d

No Trains Are Moving.
In the height of the excitement
:aused by the news of the battle of
>an Geronimo, interest has temporarily
aded here In the question of the use of
he Mexican railroads for transporting
upplies to Gen. Pershing's columns.
Apparently, the solution of this prob- i
em is still far from found.
A good deal of curiosity has been
roused over the failure of any train \
o arrive at Juarez over the Northwestrn
railroad for a week. No train has !
eft the Mexican town in the same
ime. A train from Casas Grandes due
lere yesterday morning has not yet
tut in an appearance.. The Mexican
fficials offer no reason for its nonrrival,
but insist there has been n?
nisbap. a claim that is supported by
he fact that the Mexican railroad tele:raph
is working without interruption.
Food Awaits Transportation.

hree Mexico Northwestern engines,
vhich were in the El I'asb and Southwestern
railroad yards here, have been

While Gen. Bell refuses to discuss the
ituation. it is said here that the quesion
of transporting supplies by rail
will be held in abeyance for a few days
n the hope that the present efforts of

will he successful.
