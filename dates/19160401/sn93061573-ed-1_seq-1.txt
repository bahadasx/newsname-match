V liatón. S. G. Gilkey, the Iledlliv
or trapper and hunter, came in this
morning from the lied River coun
try with the prize catch of the sea
son, the same being "Old Gray," the
largo lobo wolf that has been prey
ing on the cattle ranges of that sec
tion for many years, mid w hich has
been bunted and sought for by nu
merous hunters and trappers lie
cause of the price sei on the head
of the old stock murderor.vMr. Gil
key secured his catch n a No. 3 trap,
and was somewhat surprised to
find that at last he had captured
the large lobo. The old fellow had
marks indicating that he has been
in the trap before, the toes of bis
right front foot being missing.vThe
pelt shows the wolf to be fully as
large as has been represented, and
is said to be one of the largest tak
en in this section. , Cattlemen in
the lied ltiver sectioi, estimate their
losses from' thf ravages of the old
brute to be in the neighborhood of
i 10,000.00 the past live years. V(Only
two days ago the brute attacked
and destroyed a line yearling for
the Adams Cattle company, and
then walked into the trap. Mr. Gil
key also brought along 18 coyote
pelts and 7 bob cats as a result of
bis month's trapping.
Au(o Causes Runaway v'
lloht. Martin, well-known ranch
man living on the Mlmarrou above
Kenton, was painfully injured and
Mrs. Martin narrowly escaped ser
ious injury. when tlie mules they
were driving became frightened a
few miles out of Clayton and ran
away. ('.. J. Kaho, or the Mission
theatre driving a cur Hying an ad
vertising banner is reported to have
frightened the nuiles causing them
to whirl and to tip the wagon to
a sufficient angle, to throw .Mr. Mar
tin to the ground. Mrs. .Martin was
not thrown out but was forced to
stay with the wagon for a perilous
ride until the mules ran down, a
distance of more than a mile. V
Mr. Martin was brought to the
home of his sister-in-law, Mrs. A.
C. Loveless. He sustained ugly
cuts about the head and a wrenched
back, but is reported recover
ing. Financial Agent Inspection Fnrni

company spent this week making a
tour of tho county in company with
the local agent, Claire Roberts, for
the purpose of inspecting real es
tate loans of which his company

Mr. Roberts took advantage of the
trip to get acquainted with folks
needing -life insurance u be is mak
ing strenuous efforts to be at the
top of the list in life insurance line
in the state.
Cur of Trees Arrive
Union county farmers evidently
have faith in the fruit tree growing
elements in oirr soil if we are to
judge by the number of fruit trees
that came in one shipment this
week. T. J. Brook", local agent for
the Ottawa Star nursery announced
the car load arrival of fruit and
shade trees and shrubbery valued
at more than $2,500. The shipment

ed rib resulting from a fall from a
transfer wagon from which he was
assisting to remove a box of trees,
Friday afternoon. The transfer
man, it is reported, started,, to shove
tho box from the wagon. . Tho box
in its course struck the edge of the
gang plank on which Mr. Brooks
was standing, tripping him, causing
the fall to the cement sidewalk.

BOOSTING BUSINESS MEN
NOMINATEOJBY DEMOCRATS
The democratic, city convention,
Tuesday evening was well attend
ed The convention organized by
electing Capt. T. S. Snyder as chair
man, and C. O. Dunn, secretary, A.
C. Miera and Elíseo Martinez, inter
preters. Captain Snyder in a vig
orous and well received address,
outlined the object of th conven
tion anil suggested that it get to bus
iness. It was moved and seconded that
a committee of live be appointed
by the chair to suggest to the con
vention names for candidates for
the various offices to he filled and
while the motion was open b dis
cussion Mr. Owen was recognized
by the chair.
Mr. Owen pointed out to the con
vention the neressily of placing on
ly men who were, known and tried
Democrats and men of sterling
worth on the ticket.
"There are," he said, "Democrats
in this town capable of running the
affairs of the city better than they
were ever run before, and we want
these men. We want new blond."
He then went on to state that the
credit of I he city had been ruined
by a previous board and was not,
even to this day, as substantial and
unassailable as it might he.
"Why," he said, "I have been told
that under the regime of a former
board when a man wanted a meter
put in bis bouse be hud to pay for
the meter so the city could get it
from the factory. If he wanted a
motor in his business ho had to pay
for it before the city could get it
from the manufacturer. I under
stand that even tho siren fire
whistle was shipped to Clayton C.
O. D."
Dr. Charlton was granted the
lloor and corrected the speaker. He
explained that competent engineers
had been employed by the board to
which Mr. Owen referred and that,
as is ever the case, the estimule of
these, engineers was exceeded when
the actual work of pulling in the
plant was finished.
"The board saw," said Dr. Charl
ton, "that the estimate would be
exceeded before the jitant was fin
ished and to prevent the purchas
ing committee to exceed tho amount
set aside for the purpose tho board
met and passed a resolution to tíic
effect that all material should be
paid for as purchased."
"And," he concluded, "if it is true
that the lire whistle came to Clay
ton C. O. D., it was not becauso the
credit of the town had been squand
ered and ruined, but because tho
board, wishing to maintain tho cred
it for Clayton, had so ordered it."
John Spring corroborated the
statement of Dr. Clrarllon and ad
ded that the credit of the city was
as good during that regime as now,
and that while tho noard in ques
tion had run short of funds the dis
crepancy had been mado up by
members of tho volunteer flro de
partment at the time, who had, as
an association, some nine hundred
dollars.

Sec. Modestly Admits
He's the Whole Show
Santa Fe, N. M, March 27. For
the first time in many years United
States Senator Thomas Benign Cat
ron isn't coming homo to Santa Fo
for the coming spring municipal
election. That may be explained on
the ground that Mr. Catron doesn't
think the opposition has any chance
of moking a dent in tho city Repub
lican organization. I'he fact that ho
isn't coming back to New Mexico
for several weeks yet, however, has
given riso to some speculation on
another score, as it is increasingly
evident Mr. Catron will have to do
some lively scrimmaging if he is go
ing to be renominated by the Repub
lican party of the state.
"I'ncle Tom" Says Nothing
Frank A. Huhbell started out with
being a formidable candidato for
the senatorial nomination. His cam
paign has progressed to tho stage
where he appears to bo absolutely
confident of the nomination. So far
practically not a word has been
spread around of the progress of
the Catron light, as to whether he
is going to tight, whether he think3
he has the nomination sewed up or
not; no one has even heard semi
officially what "Undo Tom" thinks
of the Hubbell candidacy.
No Rets by Those Who Know
Mr. Catron's silenco and apparent
inactivity have conduced lo tho con
fidence of the Hubbell forces; but
those acquainted with Mr. Catron's
long political career and conversant
with his political perspicacity aro
not laying any strong bets as to tho
outcome, even though on tho faco
of the situation he appears to bo
almost out of the running. Appar
ently only the alleged weakness of
Hubbell with the general voting
public or a prompt combination
with Secundino Romero and tho
San Miguel contingent, to secure tho
the powerful backing of that Re
publican faction can bring home
the bacon for Mr. Catron. Mean
while the silence and alleged inac
tion of the senatoe are puzzling to
Republicans.
Seciiudiiio Romero in Earnest
i Secundino Romero continues to
j give daily demonstrations of tho
I truth of his claim that his candid
jacy for the governorship is no
"stall." He continues to warn Re
publicans that the nomination of
Bursuin will spell dereat with a
big I) and it will bo absolutely fatal
to repeat the "error of 1911."
"Tho Republican party," ho Bays
in the last issue of his El Independ
ente, "learned a costly lesson in tho
first state election, and It is not
reasonable to suppose that it will
again make the mistako that gavo
the Democrats a partial victory in
1911. We arc sure that tho Repub
lican party is not disposed lo re
peat an action that has been proved
contrary to its interests and wel
fare, and contrary, likewise, lo the
interests and welfare or tho people.
By reason of which, wo repeat, wo
are absolutely confident that the
Republican candidate for governor
of New Mexico will bo tho only man
who can carry the party to the
most complete victory tho, Hon.
Secundino Romero."
Must Reckon With Sun Miguel
In an article dealing with last
Monday's meeting of Guadalupe
county Republicans at Santa Rosa,
El Independente says:
"A very interesting feature is
that tho Republicans of Guadalupe
county have agreed to support
whatever candidate for United
States senator may be selected by
the Republicans of San Miguel, and
the 1,800 Republican majority in
this county cannot bo discounted.
San Miguel county holds in its
hands the balance of power, and it
is entitled to the greatest consideration."
