I "May I seem to speak with
particular sincerity and
ncss to the people of tj»« ..great
South ? Although 1 was born
and raised in New Eu»land, iny
mother taught school in Alabama,'thought
before I was born, and learned to
I ve the South in a way that was
imparted to her soil. Again while
J at Dartmouth College in New
j llainspliire, 1 came South during !
I my college course and attended
j" ie term at Vanderbilt Univers
jity, Nashville, for the sipecial
uirposc of studying the South
and meeting Southern men. Tu
lane University at New Orleans
gave me my tirst honorary degree 1
of Doctor of Laws. Always, in
my diploatie service of tiic last
twenty years, whether as your
Minister to Asia or South Amer- ;
ira or as Director General of the
! Pan American Union iu Washing
I ton, I have faithfully striven to
i represent and remember the com
men ial and political interests of
the South as well as of the North,
East and West,
"Without speaking iu the
slightest degree officially for the
Latin American governments, In t
ying to interpret Latin Ameri-jed
can popular sentiment with which
I have been possibly in closer
touch,
years,
during the last fifteen
than any other officiai of
this country, let me emphasize
that all Latin America from Cuba
find Guatemala on the north to
Argentina and Chile on the south
re watching this Mexican situa
tion more carefully than any oth
er international crisis that has
arisen in the last fifty years.
They are even more concerned
with ils final issue than they are
with the conclusion of the Eu
rojiean war. They are following
the development of events on the
border and their possible out
line with an unavoidable tend
ency to decide from such outcome
what is the real and permanent
purpose and attitude of the Unit
ed States toward Latin America
and the much discussed policy of
the new* Pan Americanism.
"It is not my intention to sug
gest for a moment that Latin
America has not sympathy with
the United States as well as Mex
ico in this crisis or that Latin
America is openly opposed to the
' nited States in the organizing
and conducting of the punitive ex
pedition against Villa. It is
rather my desire to suggest that
Latin America will scan with
wa y toe
dosest scrutiny the

which will weld the Amern, m

cal interests, an interdependence
of coinnierce, and a unity of pur
pose and action, and which will
make Pan America the Lader in
world civilization, in worl,| com
Imerée, and in world peace.
'While many men, in undue
earnest-[excitement, call,for the seitle

ganlless of Latin American senti
incut, they cannot deny on second
that the United States
f ernment and people by flag
rantly disregarding Latin Ameri
eau publie opinion might wreck
'and completely destroy the l'an
! American ship of state which
they have been so carefully* con
strueting with the cooperation of
Latin America, and which now
under the 'unprecedented favor
able conditions brought about l»v
the European war, is about to set
1 } on the Pan American seas
without fear of the mines ami snli
marines of international distrust,
envy and competition, and which,
; if the Mexican situation works
out all right, will be welcomed
with acclaim in every port, so to
speak, of North, Central and
South America from the G.df of
Mexico to the Straits of Magellan !
"In other words, let the Unit
|ed States strive to so shape and
settle the Mexican <|ucstion and
bring permanent order, peace and
stability to Mexico that the Unif
States will win forever the
[confidence and commerce of its
,twenty sister neighboring Ann ri

(ran republics having a population
Jof eighty millions of souls, an area
'of nine millions of sip.arc miles,
and au annual foreign trade with
the United States already valued
in excess of eight hundred mil
lions of dollars and destined, if the
Mexican problem is successfully
solved, to double itself, with di
rect effect on the industrial « nd
agricultural prosperity of the en
tire iSouth, within the next live
or ten years.
"If what I have said here
awakens your further interest in
Pan American possibilities, I beg
of you to communicate with me
the Pan American Union in
Washington which is the great in
ternational bureau of Pan Ameri
can information, always ready to
do anything in its power to pro
mote Pan American commerce,
Pan American friendship and Pan
American peace."
