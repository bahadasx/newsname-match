experienced man in this line and is
the owner of several of the best
race horses in the state. He has
three of them now in training at
the-Wallior park, and they are be
ing taken care of by Mr. E. K.
Wallior of this city.
The Opelnusas section has always
had the reputatio, of producing
some of the best race horses, not
only in Louisiana, but in the whole
country.
Mr. J. H. Barnett, circuit.ecre
tar, Alexandria, has given out the
following conditions governing the
meet:
"Every heat a race, one-third of

reject any entry for 'cause. One
horse may be entered in two classes
and only pay for the'one that starts.
Must pay ,on entry fee whether
started or not. Two horses from

The Frisco has again inaugurated
regular service between Houston

runs, was covered by the recen
overflow. However, since the wa

DEMOCRATS WELL RECEIVED BY
VOTERS OF OPELOUSAS SECTION
Pleasant, Coco Thomas and Local Orators Speak In
Name of Democracy To People of Opelousas
At Enthusiastic Meeting Last Saturday
On last Saturday night the local
courthouse was packed to its full
capacity to hear Attorney General
Ruflin G. Pleasant, Speaker Thomas,
Judge Coco and a number of local
orators in the intereset of fhe
Democratic nominees.
The meeting of Saturday night
was said to be one of the largest in
the campaign. The courtroom
was jammed and many were stand
ing the 'ailes and doornays.
The speakers were all liberally re
ceived and enthusiastically ap
plauded at all telling points. It was
nearly midnight when Mr. Thomas
concluded his address, and the court
house was just as well packed at
the close o the meeting as at the
beginning. Not more than ten or
twelve persons leaving the meeting.
Hon. John W. Lewis, who has
taken much interest in the candida
cy of Col. Pleasant, since the be
ginning of the primary campaign,
called the meeting to order and pre
sided. Mr. Lewis' remarks in open
ing were well received. b
The first speaker introduced was
Charles Williams of Lake Charles.
Mr. Williams is a good speaker. He
was one of the leaders of the Hall
forces in Calcasieu in 1912. Mr. Wil
liams devoted his time principally
to the moral obligation of one who
participated in a pimary. His ad
dressed was closed with reference
to. the Wilson administration. He
peaised the Democrratic adminis
tration very highly and said that it
was ode of the best that the nation I
has had in years.
Judge Coco followed Mr. Willaims,
speaking in English. After discus
sing some of the issues of the cam
paign, the Judge paid much atten
tion to the Independent Democrats.
He said 'that there was no such a
thing,,as an Independent Democrat.
There should be two things on the
ticket, he said, one to be a rooster,
the gamest thing that ever lived,
and the other the bull moose, and
about the most cowardly.
Judge Coco said that Mr. Parker
was suffering from an attack of
inflated egoism and was ging about
Louisiana in an effort to make the
people of the state believe that their
prosperity depended upon his elec
MRS. CLARA VOORRIES
EDWARDS
This community was greatly
shocked to learn of the death of
this estimable lady, which occurred
on Sunday night, the 26th inst.
Clara Voorhies, as she was called
by her friends and intimates, was
born in this parish, and lived in
New Orleans during her childhood
and young womanhood. She was
the daughter of Estelle Dupre and
Major Octave Voorhies. On her
mother's side, she was connected
with the Dupre family, being a
granddaughter of the late Cyprien
Dupre, and a first cousin of the
numerous relatives springing from
this. parent tree.
Her father was, before and after
the war, a merchant in affluent cir
cumstances. He gave his daughter
the education her station in life de
manded. She was an accomplished
musician and possessed a magnifi
cent voice. Her French was the
language of the elite of her city.
She was a woman of surpassing
beauty,--indeed, she was reputed
one of the handsomest women of
her day.
Quite early in life she married a
magnificent gentleman, Mr. Louis
Renaud, a Belgian by birth and ed
ucation. Very soon after their
marriage, they removed to Texas,
where Mr. Renaud contracted yel
low fever from w~ich he died.
Soon thereafter, the family moved
to Opelousas where Major Voor
hies secured employment in the
Clerk's office, which position he oc
cupied until his death in the year
of 1880.
It was while living in Opelousas,
she met and married a second time
to D. S. Edwards, a prominent
planter of the Bayou Boeuf neigh
borhood.
When Hildevert Deshotels was
elected sheriff in 1896, the family
movd to Opelousas, where they
tion as Governor. The judge created
a little laughter in paying his com
pliments to Mr. Dubuisson, who was
seated near him. His explanation of
Mr. Dubuisson's withdrawal from
the race was illustrated by he story
of the negro and the mule. While
riding the bucking mule the negro
was throw-n down on the plowed
ground. He got up, wiped his eyes
and said: "Now, dat's de way to do
it. When you see you is 'bout to
be throwed, jes' get off." He said
that Mr. D~ibuisson got off before he
was thrown off. He referred to those
who are going to vote for Parker,
saying: "They are traitors to Dem
ocracy and should be shot--out of
the party."
Judge Coco-still insisted that the
negro issue is a live one. He said
that it is a dangefous issue; that if
both white parties were equally di
vided the negroes would register
and pay poll taxes and would be
hard to contend with. He paid
much attention to Crum and Terrel.
Parker's platform was severely de
nounced by Judge Coco. He said
that it meant the abolition of the
white primary. He then asked his
hearers whether they were in fa
vor of abolishing the primary. He
said that Mr. Parker's main issue
was Mr. Ewing. He then praised
Mr. Ewing very higily, saying that
he had always been loyal to the
party; that his two papers waged
the battles of Democracy at every
crucial period, and that Mr. Ewing
was worthy of the. highest conme
mendation. He closed with an ap
peal to his hearers to stick to the
Democratic party.
Dr. Fred Meyer, who stumped the
state for Mr. Barret, was called on
to present Col. Pleasant. In re
sponding to the request he said that
he was paying a debt of honor, be
cause he had supported Mr. Barret
to the end and held that he was
bound to support the winner in the
primary, in which he had part:ci
pated. He said that to accept the
contrary view would mean the
Mexicanization of the State of Lou
isiana. In reviewing the career of
Col. Pleasant he said that he had
been successful and tr'ue in every
relation in life; that he had giren
have since resided. Mr. Edwards
was first employed in the Tax-Col
lector's office, then was Postmaster
of this city, which position he held
until -coppelled to resign on ac
count of ill health.
Mrs. Edwards since her husband's
death, has lived with her children
in Opelousas. She appeared to be
in good health. The writer
met her frequently. Her ge
niality had never departed.
Always pleasant, always amiable,
one would never havre imagined she
had had her full measure of trials,
of tribulations, and had borne her
cross.
The writer missed her. Upon in
quiring,he learned she was very
sick. After a short illness, she
passed away, surrounded by a
devoted family and- troops of
friends of the days that are no
more.
As the sun gathered Nis glory for
a grand repose, she was laid to rest
by the side of her husband who had
preceded hei to the undiscovered
country, from 'whose bourne no
traveler returns.
Let us hope that after life's fitftl
~fever, she sleeps well.
She is survived by four sons,
Gteorge T. of the- city of New Or
leans, Hubert, Roy and Clifford of
this city, and two daughters, Miss
Daisy, a ,alued attache of this
paper, and Mrs. Russel B. Chachere.
The Clarion extends to her be
reaved family its full measure of
sympathy.

as Attorney General and that no son
of Louisiana would ever haave cause
to regret Col. Pleasant'e election as
Governor.
Te ovation given Col. Pleasant
when he advanced to speak lasted
several minutes. He made one of
the best speeches in the pra'ent
campaign, covering all the essen
tial points made in previous ad
dresses. After emphatically deny
ing that he had ever accepted the
challenge to meet Mr. Parker in
joint debate and explaining the
platform upon which he was run
ning he told his hearers that the
Republicans were attempting to re
gain control of the state through
the election of Mr. Parker. He said
that, although denouncing the boss
es, Mr. Parker was advocating a
greater boss system through the
short ballot." As did Judge Coco,
Col. Pleasant maintained that the
negro issue was one of much .im -
portance; that if Louisiana had two
parties Of equal strength that the
negro would be the balance of pow
er, and trouble would surely en
sue; that it would mean turmoil and
uerhaps bloodshed; that the motto,
of the white people, politically,
should be that of the railroad nran
-"safety first." Col. Pleasant's ap
peal to the voters in behalf of the
party aroused much enthusiasm.
Judge Dupre introduced Mr
Thomas. The statement of Mr.
'Thomas that CoL Pleasant wbuld
carry every parish composing the
fourth, fifth and eighth, districts-
twenty-nine in number--elicited
much applause. He said that if
Louisiana had two parties we Wouldt
have the negro to contend , with
whether we wanted him or not.
He referred to the negro registra
tion in the different parishes, and
stated that while Mr. Parker did not
want. them that he would get them
just the same. Mr. Thomas further
stated that Mr. Roosevetl was not
a friend to the South, as was' indi
cated by his denunciation of Jeffer
son Davis as an arch traitor -and
repudiator. He concluded with a
pretty tribute to Col. Pleasant as a
school boy, a soldier and a public
official.
