Elect Pettit and
McGregor; City
Needs Efficiency
McGregor
Henry .1. MsOMfJW stands
for a more progressive de
velopment of Tacoma.
And lor a practical ecoii-
omy in Ihe operation of mu
nicipal Koveniinent.
In a life spent in large con
tracting projects, he has continu
ally practiced economy from ■
business standpoint - achieving
the gTMteet results at the least
possible expense -and h" believfli
thai the same principle should bo
followed in all city work.
I'ost Increases 50 I'd.
McOrvCOr declares that the city
of Tnctima has not be n operated
on 11 business basis. Daring -lie
last six years, when business in
the Northwest has advanced at a
Miail-liUe pace, and ull luiHlness
establishment.- have cut expenses
to the hone, the cob! of operating
Taeonia V municipal machinery
lihh increased practically .10 per
cent.
"Thefp has been no Juatlflca
tion for this increase," says the
candidate. The city should bare
practiced retrenchment.
"If a city is man;i!;ed )>\ com
petent men. it can be conducted
with tlie same economy and busi
ness sense as a private corpora
tion."
Where lle'il Save.
In one department at the city
hall, McGregor declares that at
least $40d a month can lie elim
inated in Mlariea of superintend
ents, if the commissioner were
only a practical man.
■.Since I have .spent all my life
in the practical construction and
operation of public works utili
ties. I can see where this expense
1b wasteful. If I were elected, 1
would do everything in my power
lo cttt out unnc'issan cost in not
only my own, but all other de
partments."
\V«uI«l Pay Off Unit,
McQragof believes fin:ily in
municipal ownership of public
Utilities, but his |n>t—l desire Is
to see Tacoma's present municipal
projects placed on a sound btisi
ness basis.
He would favor the setting
aside of as much money each year
as tlie city could possibly afford.
for the purpose of paying off
our immense municipal debt
McGregor bases his appeal for
votes on the solid foundation of
practical experience, and his
former record as commissioner of
]ulilic works.

PETTIT
I (illy as important us a
man's character and ability
lit hold public office is his
viewpoint tin puiilu affairs,
uliitli ummis and directs
his actions.
Ai\y, perhon who lias read the
! answers of !■'. H. l'ettit to the va
rious qutltloni of putilir interest
' which The TtSMa imt to the can
didates, has learned that Pettit
has I viewpoint which Is definite!
jand unwavering, drawn in lines I
that are char ami sharp.
His record in buslaesi life and '
as a public officiiil of Tacoui has:
shown tliat tills outlook on af
fairs luis governed every detail in I
his a< tions.
Not < li<|iie Candidate.
It is the view point of t.ie '
masses of people, rather than j
I hat of any clique, gnliK, M«t
or party.
The people's interest tops all;
other considerations with him. I
When Ills friends urged him to j
run for the office of city com-!
mission'r, l'ettit told them that'
if they should find ■ stronger and
more capable man with views
similar to his for the oftice, lie
stood ready to withdraw at any (
time.
Ills simple campaign promise
has been "more consideration lor |
the people."
Not Hi.i \ii', Cither.
Hut being a "servant of tlie
peniile" does not mean limply I
empty words and hot air with'
him. It BMMM definite, vital ion- i
siructive effort on his part. It!
menus hard work and the exer
cise of tlie very best tliere Is in
him.
The city lias no record of the
money it is spending, he finds.
Therefore he goes out to give the
City the benefit 01' his Inn*. :ind
successful experience in the busi
ness world, tivsteniatising the
etty'l business just as ho would
his own luisiii'ss.
Would Cut Waste.
The way to lower taxes is to
cut out waste, systematize and
reduce tiie cost of government,
lie belimes. To obtain greater
efficiency at less expense, he Is
ready to Rive detailed, personal
supervision to his department.
On the question of franchises,
everybody knows that Petit
stands unalterably opposed to
voting away the rights of the
people. lie is not the man to use
the pfople's money to pay politi
cal debts.
