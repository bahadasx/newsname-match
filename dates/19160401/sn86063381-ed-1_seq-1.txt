VOLUME XIV, NO. 82.
LARGE VOTE FAVORS
THE CONSOLIDATION
OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS
Bemidji School Board May Hold Spe
cial Meeting to Accept
Village.
EXPECT VOTE SOON
ON SCHOOL BONDS
Expected That New School Building
Will Be Constructed in
Nymore.
One hundred and twenty citizens of
Nymore expressed their approval of
the annexation of Nymore to Bemidji
and but thirty-three cast a negative
vote in the election held at Nymore
yesterday on the question of the dis
solving of the village of Nymore.
This is the first step towards annexa
tion.
To Consolidate Schools.
In the election on the question of
the consolidation of school districts
number four and number seven, 157
votes were cast for consolidation
while twenty votes were cast oppos
ing it. Independent school district
number seven is the Bemidji school
district and number four is composed
of Nymore.
The total ballots cast in the school
election was 177, being the largest
vote ever polled. This is attributed
to the fact that a number of women
cast votes. One hundred and fifty
three votes were cast on the dissolu
tion question.
Much Interest Shown.
There was much interest in the
election.
As a result of the decision of the
Nymore citizens to consolidate the
school districts and the signifying of
their intention of consolidating the
village of Nymore and the city of Be
midji, the Bemidji school board will
hold a speeial meeting soon to accept
the Nymore school district. By the
consolidation the district will receive
$2,000 and six cents a mile transpor
tation for every student who has over
one-half mile to go to school.
Preparing Plans.
The Bemidji board has been hold
ing special meetings and plans have
already been made to give Nymore
a school if bonds are voted. It is
believed that bonds will be voted for
a $40,000 school, the school to be
constructed this summer and ready
for occupancy late next fall.
By consolidating the two school
districts, the Bemidji school board
will have charge of the district. Ny
more will be given an opportunity of
selecting two members when the
terms of the present members are
ended this year.
Given Six Months.
By the voting to dissolve the vil
lage, Nymore will be given six months
to disposeof the village debts. The
debts, it is expected, will be spread
over a period of twenty years to be
paid by special assessments.
After the question of debts is taken
care of, an election will be held on
annexation to Bemidji and if ap
proved will be reported to the
council.

NO APRIL FOOL
JOKES IN BEMIDJI
Brick Covered Hats and Elusive
Pocketbooks as Well as Loaded
Candy and Cigars Missing.
April fool jokes were decidedly in
the minority in Bemidji today. At
least the practical joker whose
tricks inconvenience the many and
please the few has been more or less
a minus quantity.
Up to a late hour this afternoon
the fire department has not been call
ed out nor has there been a riot call
sent in to the police department.
Hat covered bricks, elusive pock
etbooks and loaded cigars were few
and far between. The "kick me"
sign pinned on the tail of a coat was
conspicuous by its absence.
Some few small children in nu
merous places fed their playmates
cotton candy but Outside of a few
small infractions, peace and order
seemed to be the order of-the day.

SKELETON OF
UNKNOWN MAN
FOUND AT HAUPT
Head Completely Severed as if by an
Axe Believed Man Was
Murdered.
WOLVES EAT FLESH
FROM BODY NO CLUES
Lumberjack While on Wolf Hunt
Finds Bones Covered by Brush
Pile.
A skeletoa with the head com
pletely severed from the body as if
hacked off with an axe, found under
a brush pile in the woods near Haupt
last Wednesday, is expected to re
veal one of the most atrocious mur
ders ever committed in this part of
the state.
Found by Lumberjack.
The skeleton was found partially
covered with brush near the head
quaters of the Backus & Brooks lum
ber camp by a lumberjack who wa*
tracking a wounded wolf. The: lum
berjack was skiing and one-of the
skis became entangled with the bones
of the skeleton and brush covering
ing the skeleton.
The skeleton was dug up and it
was found that the head was detached
from the rest of the bones. Bones
.gave appearance of being hacked
with an axe. A .22 calibre rifle fully
loaded was found lying near the
skeleton.
Wolves Eat Flesh.
No clothes, papers or letters were
found to identify the remains. Ac
cording to reports, the flesh may
have been torn from the bones by
wolves. Many wolves have been
seen in the vicinity during the past
few months.
Lumbermen and homesteaders be-
44evfr rthat the skeleton is that of a
man who was formerly connected
wftfr th eantp. It^"tbelleve**hit
he was killed in an attempted rob
bery.
Not a Suicide.
It is not believed that the skeleton
is that of a suicide as the bones were
completely covered by brush, the
head was severed from the rest of the
body and the gun found nearby was
loaded to its fullest capacity.

Mexicans Killed During

Washington, April 1.With Villa's
personal command smashed follow
ing yesterday's clash, officials here be
lieve that it is possible that his cap
ture is imminent. Without prestige
Villa will not find support among
the peons. Some of them will suc
cumb to the temptation of the 150,000
reward for Villa's body, it is be
lieved.
Enemy Swept From Field.
El Paso, Tex., April 1.Four hun
dred American cavalrymen under
command of Colonel George A. Dodds,
whirling down from the Granite
slope of the great continental divide,
have fallen like a thunder bolt on
the main body of Francisco Villa's
bandits at the San Geronino ranch.
Scattering them like chaff in the wind
and driving the bandit chief, wound
ed and crippled, to seek a hiding
place in the mountains over which
he has ruled for so many years.
Villa Escapes.
Villa was hurried from danger in
a carriage. The battle opened at 6
o'clock in the morning of March 29.
For seventeen hours the veteran.
Colonel -Dodd, and his rough riders of
the Seventh and Tenth cavalry, rode'
down the valley of the Santa Maria 'K
river*,= Atf^a^eTMT of a ^&^nli^ild^
they b.urst7 upon^, the unsuspecting .v
Villa camp, where 500 Mexican ban- *x
dits were celebrating the massacre of
172 Carranzistas two days previously
at Guerrero. Villai shot through the
leg and with one hip shattered was
hurried from the scene barely in time
to escape the onslaught of the Amer
ican soldiers.
Stand Attempted.
The bandits made a brief but help
less stand before the fierce charge of
Colonel Dodd and his troopers. Then
they broke and fled, leaving 31 dead
on the field, including their com
mander, General Eliseo Hernandez.
Two machine guns, a number of hor
ses, rifle, ammunition and equipment
fell into the hands of the victors.
Among the known wounded is
Pablo Lopez, Villa's lieutenant in the
Columbus raid. The American cas
ualties were four slightly wounded.
Power is Broken.
Villa's career has ended. His
power has been broken. His death or
capture is.only a question of days,
perhaps only hours.
Such is the inevitable conclusion
reached here as little by little the
detail of "Dodd's Tide" seep across the
border. It seems impossible that the
crippled, defeated bandit can long
remain hidden eyen in the mountain
ous waste in which he has sought
refuge.
Thirty Killed,
San Antonio, Tex., April
Thirty of Villa's soldiers killed, four
American, soldiers wounded and more
than 450 Mexicans dispersed, after a
running fight that extended over 10
miles, is the condensed summary of
the story of the first engagement be
tween forces of the American puni
tive expedition and Francisco Villa.
Col. George Dodd surprised 500 of
