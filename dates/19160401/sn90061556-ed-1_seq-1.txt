Geo. H. Edwards and
A B C's OF THE CAMPAIGN.
J. A. Harzfeld Explains New Charter
Union Station Civil Service
Public Service Corporations
Extravagance and Graft.
(By J. A. Harzfeld.)
The apologists for the Shannon-Jost
ticket have attempted to avoid so
much that Is an Issue in this campaign
and gain the public's ear about so
many things that never were Issues,
that a simple statement In A. B. C.
form may clear the atmosphere.
A. . What Is the principal Issue?
A more simple charter for Kansas
City.
B. .What Is proposed?
To reduce the number of aldermen
from thirty-two to not more than the
necessary heads of Departments, in
no event more than ten, each alder
man to be the head of a department,
and responsible for that department,
and devote all of his time to the city's
business, nnd receive an adequate sal
ary for his services. One-half these
men shall be elected at large, and the
other half shall be elected from the
districts, but elected at large. The
mayor and the council shall be the
only elected officers. They shall serve
four years, but the mayor shall not be
eligible to re-election. The right to
recall these officers, and the right to
elect them under a non-partisan plan
shall be submitted to the people.
Business Methods for City.
For the purpose of economy and ef
ficiency the number of departments
shall be reduced to the number of al
dermen. The council shall meet every
lay to avoid the long delays now
necessary to obtain simple improve
ments. No general franchise shall be
valid until ratified by the people.
How will such a plan improve con
ditions? It will expedite public business; It
Trill cause it to be more efficiently
done; it will abolish useless offices
and make government economical; it
-will make possible a general plan of
government by the co-operation of all
responsible men. It will MAKE THE
COUNCIL A BUSINESS INSTITU
TION INSTEAD OF A SCHOOL OF
ORATORY. ,
Union Station Proposal.
C. WHAT IS OUR POSITION ON
THE UNION STATION ROADS?
To re-submit this question to the
people.
D. WHY RESUBMITTED.
The proposal, when submitted to the
people, was written In such mislead
ing language that different men re
ceived different impressions concern-,
ing what was proposed to be done. In
one paragraph we are told that ade
quate streets and approaches are ' to
le provided for, and in another that
-ALL the land Is to be taken, so that
some citizens though only wider
streets were to be provided, and oth
ers, that the plaza was to be estab
lished. Those who believed we were
to merely widen streets would not
vote money for a plaza, and those who
"wished to beautify the station sur
roundings would not have voted $700,
O00 merely to establish streets.
E. IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE
PROPOSAL CONFUSING ONLY TO
THE UNTRAINED PUBLIC?
No. Judge Dillon, Judge Evans, and
scores of lawyers differ as to the mean
ing of the proposal.
F. Can the question be legally re
submitted? Yes. The best lawyers say so arid
Mayor Jost himself proposed this plan.
G. WILL IT COST THE TAXPAY
ERS' ANYTHING TO RE-SUBMIT
THIS JUESTION? -
No. This can be done at the time
of the election of the Freeholders who
are to draw the new Charter.
Sixth Street Plan.
H. What about the Sixth street
widening?
There is no ambiguity about the
proposal but the project should not be
begun until the case in the Supreme
Court Is decided.
Civil Service Violations.
I. Has Jost violated the Civil Ser
vice and turned the City over to Shan
non? Shortly after- he became mayor he
removed J. W. S. Peters, Democrat,
and John Thatcher, Republican, from
the Civil Service Board because they
passed a resolution to investigate the
mayor's violations of the Civil Ser
vices, immediately after the removal,
hundreds of employes were discharged
who" -won their places by practical ex
aminations given by disinterested pub
lic spirited citizens, and their places
were filled with Shannon's followers.
The examinations were farcical, dis
honest and given either by the Shan
non Secretary, or unknown men.
Public Funds.
J. Mayor Jost claims to have care
fully expended public funds. Is this
true?
He has collected two million dollars
more in. general taxes during his four
years than in the four years immedi
ately preceding, and claims to have
icaved out of this $295,000, but he has
reduced the police fund so that lives
and property have been unsafe, and re
duced the Board of Public Works
funds bo that every visitor to Kansas
City leavers with the impression that
we have fine boulevards, but filthy
pavementless streets. The balance of
this two million dollars has been used
to pay political debts to useless, work
less, employes, for he used 53 per cent
of all his funds to pay employes where
previous administrations used 41 per
cent, an. increase of Pie for Shannon's
boys of 12 per cent.
With all this tremendous Increase
of opportunity he has not built one
public Improvement.
Public Utilities.
K. Has Jost conserved the City's
rights against Public Service Corpor
ations? All of these corporations were fop
him In the Primary Election, and
these votes elected him.
Ho abolished the Utilities Commls
slon, which had gathered all lnforma
tlon concerning what, was owing the
city by these various corporations.
He appointed In their place a com
mittee from the Council that never
met a Secretary, at a large salary,
whose hardest work was to sign the
payroll. Not satisfied with removing
the possibility of gaining new infor
mation, he allowed the old reports and
tabulated statements to be destroyed,
nnd the index to all information to
disappear.
He has not Insisted that additional
storage tanks for natural gas be built,
although the previous administration
had obtained one holding 3,000,000
cubic feet, nnd had the promise of
others.
Removals from Boards.
L. Why are there practically no
men ot ability on the Charter Boards?
Because Jost Insultingly has remov
ed or forced the resignation of all who
disagree with him, and the city has
thus lost, the services of such men as
J. W. S. Peters, John Thatcher, D. J.
Huff, A. C. Stowell, William Bucholtz.
J. J. Rieger, John Tlllhoff and George
Hale.
The Charter provides that the May
or shall not have a vote on these
boards, so that they should be free
from his domination, but he has al
lowed no man to remain who would
not obey his slightest whim.
M. Have there been charges of
graft?
Yes. Many inlstances of graft have
been cited in the selling of insurance,
the purchase of supplies, the conduct
of the municipal garage, the accept
ance of worthless water pipe and oth
er materials.
N. Where were these charges
made?
In the Common Council, by a Coun
cil Committee -report, backed by Affi
davits.
O. HAS THE MAYOR EVER IN
VESTIGATED ANY OF THE
CHARGES?
No. His position in this respect was
the same as when the attempt was
made to investigate the mayor in re
gard to the Civil' Service. The men
who made the charge of grafe were
discharged, and the charges ignored.

Undaunted by the threatening
weather of last Friday evening, the
full quota of men expected met to dis
cuss and organize for the annual
spring campaign of the Reds and
Blues, April 27 to March 4. After the
opening preliminaries the secretary re
viewed the fine results of the finan
cial campaign which had reached
'$1,51)1.50 in subscriptions, and placed
before the men present the opportu
nity for another line of service through
the membership campaign. Rev. J. ,C.
C. Owens, presiding elder of the Oma
ha district of the A. M. E. church, made
the principal address of the evening.
The young men were unusually im
pressed with the kindly words of ad
vice coming from one of such broad
experience and deeply interested in
them. Lieutenants Jay Dallas Bowser,
H. O. Cook, R." P. Jackson and L. H.
Rohe made short snappy talks on the
democracy and fellowship of the Y.
M. C. A. The captains then called the
men to arms. The enthusiastic, point
ed and eloquent talks by the two
young men, Frank B. Meyes of the
Bludb and Thos. A. Lothlen of the Reds
raised the campaign spirit to feVer
heat. The teams are lined up as fol

To the Public
A circular has been published and
circulated' among the Negroes of Kan
sas City advocating the re-election of
Mayor Henry L. Jost, on which my
name appears as one of the men en
dorsing this course. I want all my
friends and acquaintances and the pub
lic generally to know that my name
was used in the matter without my
knowledge or consent, and toat I am a
Republican abvocatlng the election of
Geo. H. Edwards and the entire Repub
lican ticket
RICHARD FULBRIGHT.
COLORED VOTERS.
Tho signing of my name to a circu
lar recounting the alleged achieve
ments ot the present Jost administra
tion and urging the colored voters to
suport him was absolutely without my
knowledge and consent, and is hereby
bitterly repudiated by me.

The Next Mayor of Kansas City.
DEMOCRATIC TESTIMONY.
John H. Atwood: "Henry and his
conscience are audited once each week
by Joe Shannon."
R. J. Ingraham: "Since I came to
Kansas City when I was a young attor.
ney and Joe Shannon was a deputy
constable, I have not known him to
do a day's work. Under the law he
might have been convicted at any time
as a vagrant. This is the man who
presumes to dictate to Kansas City."
E. E. Yates: "Joe Shannon fattens
where honest men starve. He is the
creation and embodiment of corrupt
politics. He taints wherever he
touches."
Ben E. Todd: "It the majority of
the people vote this hand picked. Shan
non dictated ticket It means the fail
ure of popular government, the remov
al of the city hall and the court house
to a law office in the Scarr't building
where Joe Shannon has a law office
In which he does not practice law.
The election of this alleged Demo
cratic ticket, although in fact this boss
created ticket, means the end of the
pure Democracy, the triumph of t)
demagogues, the perpetuation of boss
ism. Is it not true that every sug
gestion and inference here raised ex
ists in the common knowledge of every
thinking man in the community. . . .
Honest Democrats, independent voters,
Nonpartisan, Progressive and Social
ist should disown the methods of boss
ism and rise in the majesty and might
of their righteous indignation to de
throne Shannonism, discredit the ma-
1 chine, destroy the boss and break the
slate, for therein lies the safety of
' the city. ... A Democrat. Joseph
1 Folk, once said: 'A boss man some
times develops into a boodler.' A
boodler Is not a Democrat, he is not
a Republican; he is neither a Progress
ive nor a Socialist, he Is a croot
whose only motive and guiding prin
cipal is the dollar mark."

FACTS ABOUT THE NEW '
HOSPITAL.
A poster featuring the statement
that the Negro Hospital is the first
actual benefit the Negroes of this city
have been granted. Is now in circula
tion, his poster is attractively gotten
up. On it are the pictures of the Insti
tution together with an array of hand
some nurses and it will be carefully
examined by any Negro under whose
eye it happens to fall.
The impression the poster is intend
ed to create, however, is that this
splendid institution and its staff ot
competent nurses and physicians were
given to the Negroes of Kansas City
by tho Democratic party, headed by
the present Mayor,
Now Get the Truth.
In 1910, during the administration
of Darius A. Brown, McWlllIam C.
Hueston called a meeting of all the
Negro physicians in Kansas City at
the Undertaking establishment . of
Watkln Bros, and Hueston, on Lydla
avenue, and. took up with them the
need of a general hospital for 'Negroes.
Participating In that meeting, and
one of the most active advocates of
the need of such an Institution, was
the man who Is now at Its head, Dr.
W. J. Thompklns. That meeting,
through the activity Dr. T. C. Un
thank and Wm. Hueston, resulted in
arousing Mayor Brown's Interest to
the end that $15,000 was appropriate
out or tne general fund Tor whipping
the Institution Into such shape that It
PRICE, 5c.
would be a credit not only to the Ne
groes of Kansas City, but to the city
as well.
In October. 1911, the old Hospital
was turned over to Negro Internes
and nurses by the Republican Mayor,
Darius A. Brown.
The only addition that the Demo
crats have made was to appoint Dr.
W. J. Thompklns superintendent, as
a reward to him personally for sup
porting the Democratic ticket. And
another thing:
The poster bears the signature ot
two men, Richard Fulbright and C. H.
Pendleton, who claim that it was
brought into being without either their
knowledge or consent.
COLORED OFFICERS IN THE REG
ULAR ARMY.
In the regular army there are three

NEGRO PRAISES EDWARDS.
At a political meeting one of our
Colored citizens was making a speech.
In which he reminded his hearers ot
Geo. H. Edwards' fight against "Jim
Crowism" in Kansas City. This citi
zen said:
You remember atfew years back,
during Crittenden's administration,
that they were trying to pass In the
council the Jim Crow Law in Kansas
City. Mr. Edwards, at that time, was
an alderman and bitterly fought
against that bill, and by his persistent
fighting to defeat the bill, which he
did, and to defend the dignity of the
Colored citizens marked him as a man
whose honest morals made him unde
sirable for this fraudulent and dishon
est administration.
Gentlemen: Mr. Edwards has been
In business in Kansas City for more
than twenty-five years and in all these
years had had Colored men In his em
ploy, and today he has three Colored
men, one of whom has been in his em
ploy for more than twelve years; one
four years and one a lettle better than
one year, and in all he says he has no
reason to regret having had them jn
his employ and they are in responsible
positions, i: e:. shipping clerk, head
packers and mail packer.
Now, gentlemen, is it not reasona
ble to assume that, if Mr. Edwards in
his private life has this regard for the
Colored citizens ot Kansas City, that
if he is elected mayor of Kansas City
on the fourth of April next, that the
Colored citizens will have a govern
ment such as Kansas City has never
seen?
A great waiters' mass meeting will
be held In St. James church. lftr
