SAINT PAUL'S COLLEGE
A WIRELESS STATION ERECTED
IN SCIENCE DEPT. OF ST. PAUL'S
A College That Is Winning an Enviable Reputation as an
Institution of Learning and Whose .Record inAth
letic Fields Was One of Unpiecedented Success.
The very newest thing in the
science department at St. Paul's Col
lege is the Wireless Staion. For the
past two months, under direction of
Rev. Father Martin, O. S. B., the
station, has been in process of erec
tion, and only .the past two weeks.
bringing the last pieces of the set
found it Complete. A description of
the station follows:
The Aeriel is of the inverted L
type, consisting of two strands of
No. -4 B. and S. copper wire, which
is sodn to be replaced by an Aeriel ao
four wires of superior material.
This will .,be composed of fine an
tennum wi:e of seven strands of
No. 2,. The height of the Aeriel
is 82 fbet, with a length of 90 feet.
The transmitting set consists of a
rotary converter, which, run on city
current, furnishes alternating car
rent, 150 volts to a 1-4 K. W. "Blit
sen" Step-Up Transformer, a high
potential condenser of the glass
plate type, .01 M. F. capacity; 1-4'
K. W.; stationary spark gap; 1-4 K
4 W. "Blitzen'' oscillation transformer.
The receiving set includes a "Blit
l ;sen" receiving transformer; fixed
condenser; rotary variable condens
er, mounted in a cabinet; a Ferron
detector, and high grade 2000 ohm
head set.
The radio set is complete and of
the latest and most approved design.
It is expected when the station i
aense is applied for, that the limit
range allowed amateur stations
two hundred meter-wave length
will be required, giving sufficient
wave-length to carry to New Orleans
and points in the vicinity. Mes
sages may be caught from all partr
of the division, and a favorite diver
sion has been to daily catch Stand
ard time from the air. This is giv
en out from central stations at 11
o'clock each day, and is designated
by a long series of dots, followec'
by a pause, and then one long dash
at eleven o'clock sharp.
The radio set, as installed, is com
plete, and only awaits the verdict
of the State Inspector, and the grant
ing of a license before operation.
We would like to get in touch wit"
any amateurs in the vicinity, as com
munication via wireless will be tc
our mutual benefit in such a case.
The Literary Societies and Debat
Breakwater Meeting, Mandeville Today
Mandeville citizens will hold a
meeting at the town hall Saturday
evening for the purpose of settling
the question of the release of the
contract for the building of the
breakwater. At a former meeting
this matter was supposed to be set
tied, legal advice having been given
that there was no obstacle in the way
of such a proceduTe. Since then the
question seems to have arisen as tc
whether the notes, which it is saWl'
Meridian Oil and Gas Co. Confident it
Will Strike Oil at Sulphur Springs.
The drilling crew of the Meridian
Oil abd Ga:s Company arrived fron
Meridian last Sunday afternoon, and
immediately took their places at th
4di illing rig.
It is claimed that this drilling
crew has been trained like a base
ball team, and that they are all hon
est, sober, and competent persons.
The officers of the company sai
they will maintain military-like dis
clpl!ne while the well is being drill
ed. No member of the team will be
permitted to lo any drinking dth
any violation of the rule will bt
cause for immediate discharge.
The drill has started and the man.
Ing Clubs furnish :entertainment
weekly, and from the quality of ar
gumentation, and the piquant with
and repartee that presides at every
session, one readily believes that in
some of the speakers he sees future
celebrities. A bPicture of the Senate
or Congress arises before the mind'r
eye when beholding some youthfu'
orator declaiming for or against
"Government Owudrship'" or for or
against "Government Control of the
Missiseippi," 'etc.' Much good ma
terial is being developed, and Louisi
ana, will not suffer from a scarcity of
barristers, if indications count.
The baseball team of St. Paul's
has been organized, and under the
able management 'of Coach Bruce
Hayes, formerly connected with Tu
lane University, and whose reputar
tion as a baseball man is too well
known to necessitate comment, the
boys have been working hard and
are now just rounding into form.
Three games have been played to
date, two being with the St. Joseph
Seminary of St. Benedict, resulting
in an even break, one .won and one
lost. The last game played on Sun
day, March 26th, against Viccaro's
Semi-Pro. team out of New Orleans,
resulted in a defeat for the collegi
ans. The New Orleans aggregation
was made up of a l14t of the best
baseball players in New Orleans, and
added to this, the pitching of Brock
man, of the Viccaro's, was sensation
al at times. The score was 7 to 1.
The schedule of games is now
practically complete, and includer
most of the prep. schools in the vi
cinity, particularly New Orleans, and
many good games are anticipated.
The next game will be Sunday, April
2 (to-morrow), at St. Paul's stadium
against the team of Loyola Universt
ty of New Orleans.
Wednesday, the 29th instant, the
St. Paul Juniors journeyed to St
Benedict to play a return game with
the Juniors of that institution. They
determined to wipe otit the stain-. a
defeat suffered in a previous game
The Paulites won by a big score
18 to 10--thus evening things up

this matter seems easily to he settled
it is probable that these will be nc

When the Association of Com

was only a partial comprehension of
the greatness of this* question.
There has been a realization, in a
general way, that slow train service
was keeping people away from Cov
ington, but the great extent to which
this inadequate service was respon
sible for fewer people of New Or
leans establishing residences in Cov

more comprehensive when the com

of Commerce got to work in the in

A SLIDELL FIRE
BURNS FOUR
BUILDINGS
Woman Rescued From the
Flaming Building by
D. S. Cleveland.
LOSS ESTIMATED TO
BE ABOUT $20,000.00
Contents of Buildings Most
ly Saved by Work of Sev
eral Hundred Citizens.
Slidell, March 29.--Fire originat
ing from unknown causes in the
Headley Hotel and restaurant, a
two-story building, at 4 a. in., to
day, destroyed this and three other
buildings, causing a loss estimated at
$20,000. All the buildings were in.
sured.
A Mrs. Jopes narrowly escaped
death in the hotel building. She
was overcome by smoke soon after
the blaze was discovered by D. 8
Cleveland. The latter brought he:
out of the doomed structure to safet)
and she was revived.
Cleveland asserts that if he could
have obtained a bucket of water
when he first discovered the fire he
might have been able to extinguish
it at once, but that he could find noni
and it wa.s whi'e looking in a rootr
nearest the blaze that he found the
woman overcome by smoke. Bt th,
time he had placed her in safety
the fire was beyond control, an-'
within a short while the Headley
building was wrapped in flames
which were communicated to a one
story building occupied by Joe Pro
vata as fruit store and barber shop.
The fire spread until it destroyed the
two-story building owned and occu
pied by C. L. Baker as saloon, and
the two-story dwelling of Henry Cor
nibe was burned also. This late
building, also the Headley Hotel ant
Provata place, were owned by O. R
Brugier.
The fire occurred in the vicin it:
of the recent Hoyle saloon fire. / Thb
hard work of several hundred ct'
sens saved most of the contents o
all the buildlngs.

Mr. Domergue wrote thirty-two
letters to prominent businessmen of
New Orleans, receiving replies from
eighteen with the announcement that
if such a train were put on they
would gladly rebide in Covington.
Most of these people said the only
reason why they have not come to
Covington wa sth. length of time
it took to go to agd from New Or
leans, and that they were pleased to
learn of the probability of a faster
train.
Mr. J. Louis Smith received six
favorable replies from ten letters,
with somewhat the same comment as
above, and one man said be knew of
ten others who would be glad to live
in Covington, if the fast train was
put on. Other leters will be -writ
ten by both Mr. Domergue and Mr.
Smith, and Mr. Davis and Mr. Haller
will also write letters. It is expect
ed in a short time an estimate may
be made of the number who will take
advantage of the "Bankers' Special,"
if it is put on.

i PEOPLE IN AUDIENCE
Parker Warmly Applauded
and Considerable Enthu
siasm by Parker Men.
The Parker meeting at the Park
view Theatre. Frida. week, drew a
crowd estimated at from four to five
hundred people. It was. the tfrst
time the people of this section had
had an opportunity to hear Parker
speak, and there were a large number
of Pleasant people in the audience.
Parker was frequently applauded.
He roasted Bob Ewing as a boss. HE
denied that he was in favor of put
ting the negro in politics, spoke of
his plan for rural credit system, out
lined the manner in which he wouki
,form. the constitutional convention,
spoke in support of his short ballo4
and declared for the abolition
of the fee system. His speech cov
ered matters that he has gone re
peatedly over and that has been re
ported in his various speeches. HF
also declared for abolishing the pri
mary law, and he seemed to be par
ticularly displeased with lawyers and
newspaper men.
Harry W. Fitzpatrick and Gas. J.
Labarre aslo spoke. MLr. Labarre
said that he had been informed tha
he was the only man in the United
States that positively refused to hirt
a negro to work in his timber camps
That he refused to have a negro i,
the village in which his home wa:
located.
Nothing was said that has not
been brought out in his other
speeches.
He wanted to ask the editor of the
St. Tammany Farmer some question!
about the constitutional amendments
but the editor was busy getting the
paper to press and could not be
present.
Taken altogether the meeting maR
be said to have been an enthusiastic
Parker meeting. Probably every
Parker man in this section w·ho coulad
be present was present. There werr
about twenty on the platform, and
Mr. B. O. Davis introduced the
sapeakers.

APPEAL FOR
M. C.B. LIBRARY
If Covington had no public library
and the question was brought qp of
its need in the community, it would
be considered a good thing; and if
the proposal was made by some
wdalthy philanthropist to donate a
library to the town on condition that
the upkeepl of the library would be
-provided for by the citizeins of the
town, the proposition would be
grabbed up in a hurry. If this ktate
ment is true, and it certainly is un
less we are the most unprogressive
people on earth, then is it not a
shame that the efforts of the young
women who have by their energy
and perseverence provided us with
such a library should be rewarded
by a flat failure of the people to ap
preciate the work, and that not
enough money can be raised in be
half of the library to pay the sma11
salary of the librarian?
This is the situation, and if some
thing is not done the ibrary will
have to be abandoned. The sub
scription is but one dollar a year. If
there are any who desire to become
subscribers, now is the time to send
the subscription in. There are many
good books in the library. Surely
there are people enough who read,
in and around Covington, to make
up a sufficient fund to meet the 11
'brarian's salary and the few expens
es of the library. We appeal to the
people to come forward and show
some appreciation of the benefits of
fered by the library and reading
room that is frequently the resort of
visitors to Covington. In fact vie
itors seem to appreciate it more than
home folks, who should be proud
of it.
At the Parkview
Theatre.
The program for this Saturday
night will include Mme. Olga Pe
trova in one of Metro's big features
entitled "What Will People Say."
This feature is in six parts and wil'
be presented at the advance prices
of 10 and 15 cents. Doors open, at
6 p. m.
Sunday's program will consist of
a five-part Paramount feature, starr
ing Elsie Janis, entitled "Betty in
Search of a Thrill." The prices on
this night will be 5 and 10 cents.
Wednesday, April 5th, there wil'
be a six-part feature of the Para
mount program with two subjects
on it. This feature will prove of
special delight to the children.
Sarah Bernhart is coming in
"Jeane Dore," and "Undine," Easter
Sunday.
Addison Robbery
Tuesday afternoon Miss Angle Ad
dison, who was to attend the three
o'clock silver tea at Mrs. L. M. Bour
geois' went into her room and took
some silver from her purse and Ire
turned the purse to its place on the
bureau. She did not again ehter
the room until about 7 p. m.' It then
preugnted an alarming appearance.
Bureau drawers were opened and the
contents were tumbled about; the
wardrobe was in a similar plight and
the condition of the whole room
showed that thieves had visited it
during her absence. Jewelry was
left undisturbed. A watch was still
lying in its place on the bureau. The
contents of the purse, some three or
four dollars, was missing. The au
thorities -were notifed immediately,

AUTO ACCIDENT AT
TALISHEEK CAUSES
INJURY TO SEV
ERALINPARITY
Car Plunges Into Excava
tion at Curve and Turns
Over Three Times.
INJURED SENT TO THE
TOURO, NEW ORLEANS
No One Was Killed and the
Most Seriously Injured
Will Soon Be Out.
Talisheek, 'La., March 27.-TaIl
sheek staged one of the most spec
tacular, unsusal and fortunate of
automobile accidents Sunday after
noon, when a seven-apssenger auto
mobile, carrying six persons, dived
almost headlong into a waater-filled
hole in the road, turned three som
ersaults, scattering the occupants on
every side, and piled up on the side
of the road badly broken and batter-'
ed-and not a serious injury was
suffered by any one of the .ix per
sons. One passenger knufeed. minor
fracture of the skull and aswiund on
the knee, and most of the others
were bruised, but two escaped with
out scratch. Miisses, Mary Dunham
and Sallie Halley were brought to
Touro Infirmary Sunday night.
The party was composed of Bur
dett Russ, W. W. Pope, Miss .Mary
Dunham, fifteen years old; Miss Sal
lie Hailey, seventeen years of age,
and a lifteen-year-old son, all resi
dents of Slidell. Russ, who is a cou
sin of Miss Dunham' was driving the
machine. None of the passengers,
say the two young men, was ac
quainted with the road. Russ said
to a reporter Sunday night at Touro
Infirmary that he was driving the
car at a good speed along the public
road, and that they had arrived at
Talisheek, a flag statio twenty-five
miles above Slidell, when they came
to the junction of the new road with
the old. *
Trap at Junction Point.
He explained that the new road
leads northwestward from the old
one, and that, unknown to any one
of the paFy in the car, a large hole
had been dug just above the poinl
of juncture, and in the center of the
old road, the dirt from It having
been used in the building up of the
embankment forming the crotch of
the two highways. As the car ap
proached rapidly, he says, he could
not see this hole; and, seeing the old
road continued uninterrupted be
yond, he did not suspect the exist
ence' of the liit until he was toc
close to it to avert the accident.
When the car dived into the hole.
it rolled over three times, finally
settling, in a badly battered condi.
tion, on the side of the road. Rusr
and Pope, both of whom were inter
viewed, are of the opin~ion that the
absence of fatality or serious in
jury was due largely to the fact that
the top of the car was down, instead
of being pinned beneath it.
Passengers bpperred Dead.
