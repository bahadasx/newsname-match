Infantry Attacks and Bambaid
ment Slackens.
London, April 1. The Crown Prince
has again shifted the attack of his
army to the east bank of the Meuse
and in a vigorous assault has gained
a footing in the village of Vaux.
Paris reports an attack by German in
fantry in the Malancourt salient.
London, March 31. Having cap.
trod the villain of Malancourt, the
Germans have now shifted their offen
sive eastward to tho sector around
Le Mort Homme. With heavy forces
the Teutons have attacked the French
line between hill 2H5 and Le Mort
Homme and succeeded in entering
French firt line trenches. A vigorous
counter attack by the French, how
ever, almost immediately expelled the
invaders and another attack by the
Teutons, delivered a little later, is
declared by Paris to have been put
down completely.
The Germans have made no attempt
to debouch from Malancourt since
their occupation of the village. The
heavy borbardmcnt3 of preceding
days in the region northwest of Ver
dun have greatly slackened, and there
also has been only moderate activity
by the big guns to the north and the
east of the fortress.
Paris reports the failure of a Ger
man Infantry Attack against the
French to tho south of the Somme
river, near Dornpierre, the shelling by
the French of German troops on the
march in the Argonne "forest and the
battering of German positions in the
forest of Agremont. Violent artillery
duels have been in progress between
the llelgians ami Germans in the reg
ion of Dixmude.
London, April 1. lioth houses of
the Dutch parliament have been called

received from Merlin that the German
government has no knowledge of the
sinking of the liner.

Detectives Fear Attempt to Res

V
Says He Was. Arrested at Hull and
Humiliated by Imprisonment in
a Dirty Jail.
Lewes, Del., March 31. Fearing
that attompts would be made to res
cue Ernest Schiller, tho young Ger
man stowaway who single-handed
captured the British steamer Matop-
po and terrorized her crew of fifty-
six men on the high seas lust Wed
nesday night, detectives tonight took
Schiller from the town jail and hur-
lied him by automobile to Harring
ton, from where lie was to he taken
by train tonight. The detectives de
clared they had received positive in
formation that attempts would be
made to rescue the prisoner.
Schiller himself readily consented
to go, saying he would do anything to
keep out of the hands of the British
officials.
During the afternoon Schiller had a
hearing and made a detailed state
ment as to his motive in starting
what he termed a privateering expedl
tion. Revenge aginst England for ar
resting him as a spy as well as tin
spoils he expected to secure, he de
clared, were the impelling motives
He was uncertain, he said, whethei
the four men he had picked to accom
pany htm had hidden on another ves
sel or had abandoned the enterprise
"They were not Germans," Schillci
declared. "I was the only Germai
concerned and only for my hard lutl
I would have turned a better tricl
than even the Moewe did when slit
captured the Appam. I was terriblj
handicapped by deponding ou bums
and crooks to assist nie.
"In making war on England I air
guilty of nothing more than a bread
of the neutrality laws of this country.
1 was peacefully practicing my pro
fession of textile engineer in Hull,
England, when the war broke out. A
friend of mine was arrested charger
with signalling with calcium lights tc
the raiding Zeppelins. He was shol
and 1 was arrested. 1 had committer
no offonse, but 1 was shut up in f
dirty Jail and greatly humiliated, al
though there was no evidence against
me."

BY COL. ILM'S
Bandit Leader Wounded And Fie: s

rHIRIY MEXICANS WERE KILLED
Running Battle of Five Hours Ended
In Complete Route of
Bandits.
El Paso, Tex., April 1. Rumors that
Villa, the bandit leader who made his
escape following the attack on his
camp by American cavalry, had been
aptured were rife along the border
but these reports have been ofllcially
denied.
The possibility that Villa 'might
succumb to his injuries because of
ack of medical attendance is one of
he possibilities being discussed in
army circles today. Villa has a bul
let wound through the leg and his hip
is badly crushed as the result of a
full from his horse.
El Paso, Tex., April 1. Four hun
dred American cavalrymen under the
command of t'ol Goorso A. Dodd, gal
oping down from the granite slopes of
he great continental divide, have fal-
tn on tho main body of Francisco

wounded is Pablo I,opi-z, Villa's lieu

Viuerican casualties were four pri

The American soldiers did not ling
or on the field of victory. For five
hours they drove-the enemy before
them into the wilderness of moiintaii
peak, desert and canyon, where road;
or even trails are unknown and whop
i misstep means death to horse and
rider. They halted only after th
:hase had led them 10 miles and the
fugitives were scattered into little
bands of half a dozen men each.
From the meager details which have
reached El Paso from Mexican and
Ameiican military sources Col Dodd'f
men made their way unnoticed
through the arroyoa, or deep gulches
which split up the foothills in all di
rections, and were almost In the camr
before the alarm was given. Villa i
reported to have been in a small tent
nursing his injuries when the crash
of the American volley fire awoke th
bandit to panic-stricken action. The
extraordinary hold the bandit cliio'
chief has on his followers is shown by
the fact that their first thought was V
save him. Unable to walk or ride, hr
was placed in a light wagon and driv

Col. Dodd attacked the Mexicans at
6 o'clcok, according to Pershing's re
port, but whether in the morning o
in tho afternoon, was not stated. Ir
San Antonio it was regarded as prob
able that it was in the morning, for
the action which followed continucc'
five hours and included a cross-coun
try chase that could not well have
been made after dark.
Of the four men wounded of Col
Dodd's force, none was injured seri
ously. No mention of woundott Mexl
cans was made in the brief official
report. The report added that a nuni
her of horses, saddles and arms had
been captured.
Several Villa prisoners were taker
in the engagement, the exact numbe
not being indicated in reports received
in Columbus, N. M. A number o
Carranza soldiers who were held by

in the pursuit. The Villa flight after

T. R. AND ROOT PUT
LEGS UNDER
SAME TABLE
Colonel and His Nemesis at Chi-
cago Dine With Eobart Bacon
TALKED ABOUT OUR D-FENCES
Reporters Informed That Politics
Had No Part in the
Conversation.
New York, Marcli 31. Senator
Elihu Root, Senator Henry Cabot
..odge, Robert Bacon, Major General
eonard Wood and Theodore Roose
velt had luncheon together at Mr. Ba
con's home, 1 Park avenue today.
Behind the mere record of the lunch
ng together of these men iurks a por
tentous political significance. It
means the meeting of Root and Roose-
elt for the first time since the Re-
lublicans and Progressives fell apart
in 1912, and it strengthens the grow
ing belief that the Republicans, as well
as the Progressives, will nominate
oloiiel Roosevelt for presideut this
year.
This is the way Colonel Roosevelt
explained the meal:
'I've been lunching at Mr. .lacon's
house with Mr. Root, Senator Lodge
and General Wood. Mr. Bacon is the
head of various defence organizations
and is bringing them together. He
told nie he got Mr. Lodge to come on
from Washington so that I could meet
:im, Mr. Root anil General Wood, to
talk over the question of preparedness
or self-denfense and as a means of se
curing the peace and honor of this
ountry, and to consider how best to
iroceed to waken all our citizens to
the vital need of this movement for
uational preparedness,"
The Colonel stopped right there, but
only for a moment. Then a genial
fleam came to his eye and he added:
"1 shall anticipate your next quest
ion by saying that we did not discuss
politics at all. The entire conversa
tion related to the matter I have sel
OIK.
This was tho first public intimation
that Senator Root and Colonel Roose
velt would ever come together again
o end the political estrangement
which followed on the split of the Re-
uiblican party in 1912.
Whether the ralson de'etre was pre
paredness or politics did not need to
je set forth in so many words, for the
jonference only shed more light on
the fight that Colonel Roosevelt is go
ing to make to stir up the country to
an heroic mood, for preparedness and
olitics are one and the same thing as
the Colonel's lriends see it, and milit
ant Americanism and Rooseveltism
are synonymous to these same wise
acre?.
REAL SIGNS OF SPRING
Grass Beginning to Show Green and
Daffodills Coming Through
March went out like a Iamb and to
day, the first of April, looks like real
spring. The grass is beginning to
;hov green and tulips, hyacinths, cro
cuses, daffodills and other spring
flowers are crowding through the
jrcund.
Continuous sunshine for eight or
more days has rapidly and steadily cut
down the great body of snow. The
surface of the ground as soon as the
snow disappears is likewise showing
tho effects of Old Sol's rays and mud
is appearing in spots. Although the
:ast winter was marked by more than
the usual amount of cold weather the
ground was so completely nnd thickly
blanketed witli snow that the frost did
not penetrate to any great depth and
hi some localities has already entirely
lisappeared.
Some farmers, who make a study of
weather conditions predict that the
coming season will be one of largo
;rors, basing their opinion on the ex
periences of previous years when win
ters with deep snow have been follow
ed J;y summers of unusually large pro
ductions of grain and vegetables.

TO TRY COMMISSION PLAN
Watervliet To Again Act on Proposal
Next Fall.
Watervliet voters at the election
next fall will vote on proposition for
a commission form of government.
Two petitions are in circulation and
they have been signed by nearly three
hundred voters. The proposition last
fall was defeated by only a few votes,
and the agitators for tho new form of
city government feel confident that
the proposition will be carried. One
of the advocates says that when tho
total number of signers had been ob
tained with the circulation of the peti
tions, the leaders of both the Demo
cratic and Republican parties would
be surprised.
