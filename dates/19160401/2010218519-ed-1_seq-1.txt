Real Preparedness
MUCH is being said
in our country
v,, nowadays about pre-f''-
paredness, and the av
erage person naturally
construes that to mean
to so fix things as to be
able to meet an attack,
come it in what form
it may, from the out
side. It is not much of a
feat for a great people
to learn the manuel of
arms and to prepare a
great store of war mu
nitions. But that is but
a branch of that thing
which is called prepar
edness. There is as much
need of prepared
ness for peace as for
war, for the former in
volves so much that
1 when achieved, it is but
a single step to the
accomplishment of the
latter.
In aristocratic Eng
land great stress is laid
upon the sacredness of
British citizenship. A
few years ago the Brit
ish government sent an
army under one of its
foremost generals into
the heart of a barbar
ous empire, to rescue
an imprisoned British
citizen and to punish
the dusky savage who
had insulted and mal
treated him. It was a
splendid deed; but the
I T' chances are ten to one
i
that the citizen, after
having 'been rescued
and brougnt home,
might have starved to
death for want of a
place to work.
In Democratic Amer
ica the citizen has a
perfect right to do any
legitimate thing, to as

QFINE, big-hearted, public-spirited citizen is P. J. Moran of Salt Lake. Few men have been
more closely associated with the upbuilding of the city and the state, and no man has con
tributed more largely of brains and enterprise to the splendid public improvements which
have been made in Zion during the last fifteen years.
"With great love for his home ctty, wonderful strength of character, and tremendous popularity
among his fellows, ho has built many enduring monuments to his genius, which will stand for gen
erations to come. lie is, in every sense of the word, an industrial captain.
Born in Yorkshire, England, January 23, 18G4, the son of Laurence Moran, of Mayo county, Ire
land, and of Bridget (Durkin) Moran, of County Sligo, Ireland; he was left fatherless at the age of
seven, and began the struggle in the battle of life in a work shop at the age of ten. From that
time until now his industrial efforts have been indefatigable. At fourteen he emigrated to this coun
try, arriving at Baltimore in April 18(78. From there he went to Cincinnati and was an apprentice
to a steam fitter. He mastered his trade and worked in Chicago until 1887, when he removed to
Omaha. There he stayed but a few months, and then came to Salt Lake, which has been his home
ever since. He married Dolly Shoebridge of Salt Lake in 1891 and there are six children, four
boys and two girls.
(Continued on Page 3.)
of late has been to H
send him or them word H
that he or they had bet-
tor come home. Then H
on arriving the former
message is related to H
"go out and rustle." H
But in inspired Ger- H
many affairs are man- H
aged differently. H
The thought that gov-
erns there is, that pre- H
paredness must 'begin H
in the cradle, that H
there must be sanitary H
surroundings for the M
child and sufficient H
food, that it may be H
physically perfect.
When, school age be- M
gins all children must M
be sent to school and M
by stringent laws em- M
ployes are compelled to M
grant all lads and M
lasses between the ages M
of fourteen and eigh- M
teen years attendance M
in continuation schools. M
By this method the M
German child gets far M
more schooling than H
the American child. H
The children of the H
very poor are red. An H
essential thing is to see H
that work is provided H
for all the people. The H
Bismarck idea is fol- H
lowed. Said he: "A man H
is entitled to say: 'Give H
me work!' and the state H
is bound to give him H
work." H
This is secured large- H
ly through co-operative H
labor exchanges H
throughout the empire. H
The result of this for H
the eight years ending H
in 1911 was that the un- H
employed in Germany H
ranged from 1.1 per H
cent to 2.9 per cent of H
the total wage-earning H
population, while in
New York and Massa- H
chusetts for a like per- I
iod, it ranged from G.8 I
per cent to 28.1 per
cent. H
Of course in citing I
the above one does not B
forget that Germany's I
industries are thor- I
oughly organized and ;H
no 1,500,000 new people I
enter there annually,
most of whom need I
work. fl
