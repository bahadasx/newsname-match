El Paso, Texaa, March 31. Four
hundred American cavalrymen under
the command of colonel ueorse a.
Todd, gilloping down from the gran
ite slopes of the great continental di
vide, hae fnilen on tha main body
of Francisco Villa's bandits at the San
Geronimo ranch, scattering them in
many directions and driving the ban
uit chief, wounded and crij-'Pied, to
teek a hiding place in the mountains.
Villa wr.s hurried from danarer in a
carriage. The fisht opened at 6 o'clock
lr. the morning of March 29 and con
tinued for several hours.
Sent a Thrill Around the Border. !
The news of the exploit was flashed
Into Juarez today and sent a thrill
B'.on? the border. For seventeen hour
the veteran colonel with his picked
troops of the Seventh and Tenth Cav
elry, drove Town the valley of the
Fcnta Maia river. At the end of a
Si-mile ride they fell upon the unsus
tecting Villa camp where 500 bandits

Eandits Made Brief but Hopeless
Stand.
Villa shot through the leg and with
one hip shattered, was hurried from
the scene barely in time to escape the
rmslaught of the Americans. The ban
dits made R brief but hopeless stand
before the charge of Colonel Dodd and
his troopers. Then they broke and
fled, leaving 31 dead on the field. In
cluding their commander. General Eil
seo Heraandez. Two machine guns a
number of horses, rifles, ammunition
irhd equipment fell into the hands of
the Americans. .
Among the known wounded Is Pablo
Lopez Villa's lieutenant in the Colum
bus raid. The American casualties
were four privates wounded.
Drove Outlaws Into the Mountains.
The American soldiers did not lin
ger on the field of victory. For five
hours they drove the enemy before
them Into the wilderness of mountain
peaks, desert and canyon, where roads
or even trails are unknown and where
a misstep means death to horse and
rider. Thev halted only after the chase
had led them ten miles and the fugi
tives were scattered into little bands
of half a dozen men each.
Villa Power Has Been Broken.
Villa's career has ended; his power
has been broken. His death or cap'
ture Is only a question of days, per
haps onlv hours. Sucn is tne inevit
able conclusion reached here as little
by little the details of 'Todd's ride"
reach the border.
To Remain Hidden Seems Impossible.
It seems Impossible that the crippled
bandit can long remain hidden, even
In the mountainous wastes in which
he has sought refuge. Among the
scene of Colonel Dodd's victory is a
broad valley lying at the head of the
Santa Maria river. On the west, side
rise the barren foothills of the conti
nental divide and to the east Is a trail,
made famous bv Villa, which loads
through the Laguna de Castilla dis
trict to Santa Ysabel. It was at the
latter place that Villa killed 18 Amer
ican mining men, a crime which sent
a thrlH of horror throughout the Unit
ed States and marked the beginning
of what many beieve to be the end
of hia bloodstained career. It was to
ward Santa Ysabel that he was be
lieved to be heading when the troop
er of the United States swept down
from the north upon his camp.
Troops Moved With Stealth.
From the meagre details which have
reached here from Mexican and Amer
ican military sources Colonel Dodd's
men made their way unnoticed through
the arroyos, or deep gulches, which
split up the foothills In all directions,
and were almost in the camp before
the alarm was given.
Villa is reported to have been in a
email tent nursing his Injuries when
the crash of the American volley lire
awoke tha bandits to panic-stricken
action.
Outlaw Loyal to Chief.
Tha extraordinary hold the bandit
chief has on his followers Is shown by
the fact that their first thought was

While thirty-one of the bandits are
known to have been ktled. it is said
the number may have been consider

it la presumably In proportion to the
dead.
Villa'a Latest Out rags.
The last outrage credited ta Villa
occurred at Minaca, a town about ten

It is not certain that Villa himself
took part in these murders, as it is
thought improbable that he could have

northeast, in the time elapsing between
the murder of the foreigners and the

Creates a Selling Atmosphere
At a convention of merchants held in the middle west one of the
speakers, the head of a successful business house said: "If you can't
advertise, quit your business. The purpose o advertising is to create
a selling atmosphere." Certain big mail order houses causo much anx
iety to many merchants throughout the country, but when ono of
them declares an annual dividend of $20,000,000 there is a good and
sufficient answer to the question: "Does it pay to advertise?"
If the merchants of a town ore interested enough in increasing
their trade to let the people know that they are in business ar.d that
they can satisfy their wants, the people will trade at home, but where
no advertising is done it is presumed that there is nothing to adver
tise, and trade goes where It is solicited.
In this part of Connecticut it is The Bulletin which shorld be
used for creating; the selling atmosphere because it goes into the
homes, is read by 45,000 or more and reaches the people who want to
buy. Bulletin advertlrin?: brings results.

Those lands cost us about fifteen
cents an acre," he said, "and we sold
them for $5 an acre on the install

1901, when he was a member of the
New Tork stock exchange under his
