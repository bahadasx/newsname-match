EL PASO, March 31. Four hundred
American cavalrymen under the com
mand of Colonel George A. Dodd, whirl
in? down from thp pro niti nlnnoa nf th
great Continental Divide have fallen
like a thunderbolt on the main bodv of .
Francisco Villa's bandits at the San
Geronimo ranch, scattering them like
chaff in the wind and driving the ban
dit chief wounded and crippled, to seek
a hiding place in the mountains over
which he has ruled for so many years.
Villa was hurried from danger in a
carriage.
The battle opened at six o'clock on
the morning of March 29.
, The news of. the brilliant exploit of
the American troopers was flashed over
the Mexican wires into Juarez today
and sent a thrill along the border. For
seventeen hours the veteran Colonel
Dodd and his picked riders of the Sev
enth and-Tenth cavalry drove down the
valley of the Santa Maria river. At the
end of a fifty-five mile ride they burst
upon the unsuspecting Villista camp
where 600 bandits were celebrating the
massacre of 172 Carranzlstas, two days
previously, at Guerrero. Villa, shot
through the leg and with one hip shat
tered, was hurried from the scene
barely in time to escape the onslaught
of the soldier of the "north. '
The bandits made a brief but hope
less stand before the fierce charge of
Col. Dodd and his troopers. Then they
broke and fled .leaving 31 dead on the
field, including their commander. Gen
eral Elisco Hernandez. Two machine
guns, a number of horses, rifles, ant
munition and equipment fell into the
hands of the victors. Among the known
wounded is Pablo Lopez, .Villa's lieu
tenant in the Columbus raid. The
American casualties were four privates
wounded. .
The American soldiers did not linger
on the field of victory. For five hours
they drove the enemy before them on
the wilderness of mountain peak, desert
and canyon where roads or even trails
.are unknown and where a mistep means
-death to horse and rider. They halted
only -after the chase had led them ten
miles from the battlefield and the fu
gitives were scattered far. and wide
in little bands of half a dozen men each.
Villa's career has ended. His power
has been broken. His death or -capture
is only a question of days, perhaps only
hours. Such is the inevitable conclu
sion reached here as little by little de
tails of "Dodd's ride" seep across tha
border. It seems impossible that the
crippled, defeated bandit can long re-
main hidden in the mountains wastes
in which he has sought refuge.
The scene of CoL Dodd's victory is
a broad valley lying at the head of the
Rio Santa Maria. On the west, rise the
barren foothills of the Continental Di
vide and to the east is a trail made fa
mous by Villa which leads through the
Laguna de Castilla district to the ill
famed Santa Ysabel. It was at the
latter place that Villa killed eighteen
American mining men, a crime which
sent a thrill of horror throughout the
United States and marked the begin
ning of what many befieve to be the
end of his bloodstained career,- It was
toward Santa Y Babel that he was be
lieved to be heading when the troopers
of the U. S. swept down from the north
upon his camp. '' . . .
From the meageY details which have
reached here from Mexican military
sources. Colonel Dodd's men made their
way unnoticed through the arroyos, or
deep gulches, which .split the foothills
in all - directions, and were almost in
the camp before the alarm was given.
Villa is reported to have been in a

WASHINGTON HEARS
WITH SATISFACTION
Republican A. P. Leased Wirt
WASHINGTON, March 31. With
Villa's main command shattered by
Colonel Dodd's cavalry dash, the war
department expects that the death or
capture of the bandit leader himself
and the successful conclusion of the
American punitive expedition to rid
northern Mexico of his raiders will
follow more quickly than it had at
first been anticipated.
Every where tonight satisfaction
over the exploit of Colonel Dodd and
his men was expressed. Secretary
Baker's congratulations were sent in
this message from Major 1 General
Scott, chief of staff, to Major Gen
eral Funston on the border: "Secre
tary of War desires you to convey to
General Pershing and Colonel Dodd
and command his nearly congraiuia-
tions on your exploit."
On behalf of the president, the
White House authorized a similar
expression. In congress the news
caused a demontration of cheers and
applause in the house when Speaker
Clark interrupted the proceedings for
the reading of General Pershing's
dispatch. The debate, on the army in-1
crease bill was halted for the reading
of the dispatch in the senate sent
to .the vice president's desk by Sen-;
ator Warren of Wyoming, General
Pershing's , father-in-law.
Officials anxiously waited further
news. Army officers believed It prob
able that in the forty-eight hours
since the fight, there had been further
skirmishes with the hard pressed out
laws, and possibly that even Villa
himself had been captured. -
Belief was expressed tonight in all
quarters that the successful end of
the American expedition was in sight
Officials believed that Colonel Dodd's
victory, if followed promptly, would
result in the death of Villa, or his
capture and would go far toward aid
ing in the restoration of peace in
Mexico. They believed the rout would
discourage outlaws' generally.
Tonight Secretary Baker issued the
following statement: "The suecces of
Colonel Dodd in catching up with the
retreating bandits and dispersing them
shows the value and effectiveness of
the preparations made by General
Funston, as well as the dash and vig
or with which Colonel Dodd himself
and the members of his command
have undertaken their task."
"It is a matter of great gratifica
tion to us all that the first encount
er is so decisive and that our own
troops have suffered so slightly. The
effect on both sides of the border will
undoubtedly be great. ' It will allay
apprehension on the American side
by showing the rapidity and effec
tiveness with which our army acts,
and among the Mexican people it will
show the singleness of our purpose
and discourage other bandits from
sympathetic demonstration.
"This .comes as a very adequate
lesson to those who feared that It
would be a long and painful pursuit
before we overtook the marauders,
and give strong ground, to hope that
the object of Jhe expedition can be
accomplished speedily."

WASHINGTON? March 31. At-'
tacks on the provisions for raising
a federal volunteer force and for the
federalization of the 'national guard
featured the debate in the senate to
day on the army increase bill.
Senator Cummins, Republican, of
fered an amendment to strike out the
federal, volunteer section and 'was
joined by Senator Hoke Smith, demo
crat, in championing the state troops
as the man force to be relied upon as
a. reserve for the regular army. 'Sen
ator Gallinger, the republican leader,
tivate the land or it will be forfeited
to the government. All the land in
cluded formerly belonged to the Mo
rales and Camou estate as did the
townsite of Agua Prieta, which has
also been seized by the state govern
ment. The funds obtained from the sale
will be used In construction of a
school house and municipal build -Ings
in Agua Prieta, the consul said.
While General Carranza,- head of
the de facto government has not fin
ally approved the recnt decre of
Gen. Calles confiscating air lands of
'enlmles of the government," such
lands have been seized and are being
held by the state.
' Unstinted praise was given in all
quarters to Colonel Dodd, the veter
an cavalry officer who rode with his
command continuously for 17 hours,
covered 55 miles, and then engaged in
a five hour fight. Colonel Dodd is
64 years of age and has been in the
saddle practically ever since the
troops were ordered to the border.
He will retire on account of age
next July.
Appointed to the military academy
from Pennsylvania, he -graduated in
1876. He commanded the Third cav
alry during the Apache outbreak in
Arizona, fought during the Indian
campaign in Oklahoma, in the Chi
cago riots In 1894 and distinguished
himself during the Spanish-American
war, participating in the battle of
San Juan and in many fights in the
Philippines. He is declared to have
been the first to suggest the now
famous "monkey drill" of cavalry
training. .
"The Monkey ' Drill" is a type of
mounted gymnastics used in "winter
time to keep men and horses in good
condition. That is carried out in
riding halls and includes a number of
circus stunts performed on bareback
horses.
In addition to exercising the mus
cles on which the cavalry man may
have to place dependence in actual
service, the drill is considered as ot
special value in teaching recruits not
to be afraid of horses and in training
their mounts to know they have noth
ing to fear from the men that harfdle
them, jump oyer them, crawl under
them and otherwise submit them to
what an uninitiated horse might re
gard as unconventional treatment.
For some time Colonel Dodd had
been charge of recruiting at Colum
bus .Barracks, Ohio, -and is credited by
Adjutant General McCain with having
done much to reduce army deser
tions, although a strict disciplinar
ian. Among the West Point classmates
of Colonel Dodd ' were Colonel Slo
cum, commanding the Thirteenth cav
alry which was raided by Villa at
Columbus, N. M., and who it v.'ith the
United States expedition. Inspector
General Garlington, another classmate,
said tonight Dodd was celebrated in
the army for fearlessness.
The war department was not ad
vised of this tonight regarding the
troops in Colonel Dodd's command,
although the Seventh and Tenth cav
alry were understood to be the nu
cleus of the column picked for the
raid. The Seventh cavalry Is fam
ous as the regiment which was wip
ed out in the Custer massacre, and
was Cut to pieces in the Wounded
Knee affair In 1891, the last of the
big Indian fights. ----- -
That the Villa prisoners taken and
the Carranza soldiers released by
Colonel Dodd's victory might aid Gen
eral Pershing in trapping Villa was
generally believed among army offi
cers.
State department officials were
hopeful tonight that there ' would be
little further delay in concluding the

ed federalization of the national

Onj-the other hand. Senator Wads-

the Chamberlain substitute for the
house measure as "without doubt the
best military legislation that has ever
been presented In the history of the
United States." Senator Wadsworth

posed of national guard officers of

staff. ,
Senator Thomas, democrat, spoke at
length on the question of national
defense, approving real preparedness.
but belittling the expressed fears of
so-called militarists in America.
Senator Cummins conmmended the
provisions for increasing the , stand
ing army, because present .relations
with Mexico necessitated a great mil
itary force. "I think we ought to
increase the regular army as much
as possible," he said. "I am fearful,
however, that the increase provided
for will not be voted for. The army
is not attractive to young men. The
compensation Is small, the duties are
repugnant, except In times of grave
danger when a high pitch of patriot
ism is aroused, I am afraid we will
not be able to recruit any consider
ably army."
' Senator Nelson, republican, insisted
that constitutional limitations would
nrevent the national guard ever being
the force on which the central gov,'
ernment could depend.

Republican A. P. Leased Wirel
Having captured the village of Mal-
ancourt, the Germans have now shifted
their offensive eastward to the sector
around Le Mort Homme, with heavy
forces the Teutons attacked the French
line and succeeded in entering French
first line trenches. A vigorous coun
ter attack by the French, howere, al
most immediately expelled the invaders
and another attack by the Teutons de
livered a little later is declared by Paris
to have been put down completely.
The Germans have made no attempt
to debouch from Malancourt since their
occupation of the. village. The heavy
bombardments of preceding days in the
region northewest of Verdun have
greatly slackened and there also has
been only moderate activity by the big
guns to the north and the east of the
fortress.
Paris reports the failure of a Ger
man infantry attack against the French
to the south of the Somme river near
Dompierre, the shelling by the French
of German troops on the march in the
Argonne forest and the battering of
German positions in the forest of Apre
mont. Violent artillery duels have been
in progress between the Belgians and
the Germans in the region of Dixmude.
There has been a noticable decrease
In the infantry fighting on the Russian
fornt, probably owing to the soggy
ground in the sprang thaw. The ar
tillery on both sides, huivever, has been
carrying on bombardments at various
points from the region of Riga south
ward. Bad weather also is hampering
the fighting between the Austraisn and
Italians.
A torpedo boat or submarine has
sunk in the Black sea the Russian hos
pital snip fourtugai, according to a
French official press bureau. The ves
sel Is said to have had a large number
of wounded men aboard.
The American ambassador in Berlin
has asked the German government
whether a German submarine torpe
doed the. steamers Sussex, Englishman
and Manchester Engineer. President
Wilson and his cabinet have again dis
cussed the situation arising from the
sinking of the Englishman and Man
Chester Engineer and the injury to the
steamer Sussex, all of which had Amer
icans aboard when the explosion oc
curred, but the American government
will take no definite action in the pre
mises pending the receipt of conclusive
proof that a submarine or submarines
were responsible.
. Again the eastern counties of Eng
land have been visited by Zeppelins,
which dropped ,a large number of
bombs at various points.
A Flight of Zeppelins.
LONDON, April 1. Five Zeppelin
airships raided the eastern counties
of England last night, according to
an official announcement just is
sued. Thus far it has been asserted
that about ninety bombs were drop

An official report regarding the
raid says: "An air raid took place
last night over the eastern counties
in which five Zeppelins are believed
to have taken part. All the raiders
crossed the coast at different places

"At present about ninety bombs are

Complaints; Possibility of

Attempted Dictation of
Vote
One arrest has already been made,
another is promised for early this
morning, and nearly two hundred ad
ditional sworn complaints are in the
process of preparation, charging il
legal registration and illegal voting
before and at the recent city primary
election. Fred Gardiner, city hall
janitor under the old city administra
tion before the commission form of
government went into effect, is cred
ited with "procuring" the majority of
those whise names are alleged to be
illegally on the registration books, and
he is further credited with having
instructed the majority of those for
whom warrants are to be issued, as
to how they should vote and for
whom they should vote. Late yester
day afternoon a sworn complaint was
filed with City Magistrate McBHde
charging Gardiner with having pro
cured the illegal registration of Sa
vannah Robinson, an eighteen year
old negro girl, who is now held ih the
city jail, serving a ten days sentence
for vagrancy. A warrant was forth
with issued on this complaint and
will probably be served early today.
Savannah Robinson, just eighteen
and not long out of the state reform
.school, was arrested several days ago,
when after examination of the papers
committing her to the reform school
less . than a year ago it was found
that she was nt that time but seven
teen years old. - In order that a case
could he prepared against her, she
was charged with vagrancy and given
ten days in the city Jail.
Immediately following her arrest she
was taken before the mayor, city at
torney and chief of police and in their
presence related how she had regist
ered and voted at the instance of
Fred Gardiner. It was her story upon
which was based the issuance of a
complaint against her charging illegal
registration and illegal voting. The
wan-ants are being held for service
as soon as she emerges from the city
Jail.
City Attorney George D. Christy
stated that the Robinson girl in his
office and in the presence of the
mayor and chief of police said that
Fred Gardiner had met her while the
original registration was proceeding
and had insisted that she register.
"But I'm only eighteen years old"
the girl is quoted as having replied.
That won't make any difference.

tary Daniels touched on all sides of
the naval preparedness program in
continuing his testimony today before
the house naval program. ' He pro
posed various modifications in and
addition to the five year building
program endorsed by President Wil
son, including the eliminating entirely
of the provisions of great sea going
submarines in the 1917 estimate.
Instead of a program for larger
vessels, the secretary suggested build
Ing three 800 ton type "boats for this
purpose three 1,000 ton Schley type
craft already having been authorized.
The remainder of the submarine fund,
he urged, should go Into coast de
fense boats of a standard type that
could be quickly secured. Thirty L
type of K type boats may be the
number agreed upon.
Other new features proposed by Mr.
Daniels were:
Construction of a great drydock at
Norfolk and possibly at Philadelphia;
establishment of a .marine, aviation
and submarine nase at San Diego,
Cal.; a study of the Pacific Coast to
determine the best location for an
additional navy yard there, probably
at . Los Angeles or San Diego; the
expenditure of $175,000 to clear the
approach to the Charleston, S. C.
yard for heavy draft ships, and, au
thorizing the rank of full admiral
for the chief of operations and fixing
his powers by law on an equality
with those of chiefs of bureaus.
The board proposed that the fleet
built and authorized should be com
posed as follows by 1919 Battleships'
48; armored cruisers, 24; protected
cruisers, 48; scout cruisers, 48; de
stroyers 48; gunboats, 6 additional.

LEWES, Del., March 31. Fearing
that attempts would be made to res
cue Ernest Schiller, the young Ger
man stowawav who single handed
captured the British steamer Matoppo
and terrorized her crew of 56 men
on the high seas last Wednesday
night, detectives tonight took Schil
ler from his cell In the town jail and
hurried him by automobile to Har
rington, whence he will be taken by
train to New York.
The detectives declared they had
received positive information that at
tempts would be made to rescue the
prisoner and with the consent of the
local authorities they decided that he
would be safer in New York. Schil
ler himself readily consented to go,
saying that he would do anything to
keep out of the hands of the officials.
During the afternoon Schiller was
given a heaHng before Justice of the
Peace Register and made a detailed
statement as to his motives in start
ing what he termed privateering ex
pedition. Revenge against England
for arresting him as a spy as well as
the spoils he expected to secure, he
declared, were the impelling motives.
He was uncertain, he said, whether
the four men he had picked to ac
company him had abandoned the en
terprise. - '
"They were not Germans," Schiller
declared. "I was the only German
concerned and only for my hard luck
I would have turned a better trick
than the Woewe.'did when she cap
tured the Appam. I was terribly han
dicapped by depending on bums and
crooks to assist me.
"In making war on England I am
guilty of nothing more than a breach
of the neutrality laws of this coun
try, i was peacefully practicing my
profession of textile engineer in Hull,
England, when the war broke out. A
friend of mine was arrested charged
with signalling with calcium lights to
the raiding Zeppelins. He was shot
and I was arrested. I had committed
no : offense but I was put in a dirty
jail and humiliated although there
was no evidence against me."
Schiller here halted his recital long
enough to request assurances that
this . government would take charge
of the case and that he would not
be surrendered to Great Britain. He
was told that was a matter to be
decided later.
Continuing, he said: "I told the
Hull officials that If they persisted in
persecuting me on account of my
German nativity they would pay for
it -dearly. They could find no ex
cuse for shooting me so they pun
ished me by exiling me from tha
country and so I came to America. I
spent, some lime in Danbury, New
Haven and Bridgeport, Conn.; and
finally went to Boston where I se
cured employment with a textile com
pany. "All Hie time I was thirsty for re
venge on the English and I used to
lie awake at night studying how to
get square and doing something for
Germany at the same time. Then it
occurred to me that it would be much
simpler for a prize crew to stow away
on British ships over here than for
prize crews to run the British block
ade. I went to Hoboken with my
plans formulated and there got my
gang, picking out four of the most
likely looking fellows to accompany
me on the expedition. I told them I
was out to capture a British steamer
and make it my yacht and explained

was accurate. According to the story
told by Waite, he also gave Kane a
check for $9,400 which Kane admitted
having accepted. This check has not
been located.
Tonight District Attorney Swann
said that Waite, who. is a prisonor at
Bellevue hospital, .where he is recov
ering from the effects of drugs taken
just before his arrest, probably will
be arraigned Monday on the indict
ment which charges him with murder
in the first degree
When told by his attorney, Walter
Deuel, that he had been indicted,
Waite exclaimed: "That's what I ex
pected." .
Deuel said that when be suggested
an' insanity defense to him, Waite
answered: "I am just as sane as you
are. You can't help me In that way.
I'n not afraid of the electric chair,"
