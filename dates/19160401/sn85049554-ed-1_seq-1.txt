but none brought additional details of
the fighting. All bore dates of Thurs
day or' early Friday, giving, officers
here hope that Villa may have been

t6at he was quite sound in mind and

It' was said that Just before Colonel

From Bachineva "a trail extends in a

For seventeen hours the veteran
Colonel Dodd and his picked jrlders of

down the valley of the Santa Mans

At the end of a fifty-ftve mile ride
they burst upon the unsuspecting

celebrating the massacre of 172 Oar

SCHILLER BOASTS
tv /OF HIS EXPLOITS
German Who, Unaided, Held Up Ship
Tells of His Various Plans, Which
Contemplated Seizure of Ship City
City of Sparta.
New York, April 1.—Accompanied by
a detective Ernest Schiller, the Ger
man stowaway, who, unaided, took
possession of the British steamer
M&poppo at sea Wednesday night, ar
rived at police headauarters here to
day from Lowes, Del.
Schiller was questioned regarding
the identity of the four men ^ho he
said were to have assisted him in an
alleged plan to capture the freight
steamship City of Sparta, scheduled
to salivate today for Vlad{ptok.
Statements by Schiller that the City
of Sparta was to carry a large amount
of Money were denied by the captain,
Japiies MceKllar, who, he .said, never
heard of Schiller.
"As for those four German friends of
his," added the captain, "they must be
masquerading as Chinamen, as I have
nobody but collies in my crew."
The police stated they desired to
question Schiller also regarding an al
leged plot to blow up a Cun&rd line
steamship ln New York. This plot
they believe, was formulated in
Hoboken, N. J. Schiller was In a
cheerful mood when hi? arrived at
headquarters.
"Why, the captain seemed to have
the idea' that I was a ferooious giant,"
he exclaimed, laughing. "When I met
-the captain I simply pointed my fore
finger at hi mand said, 'Sit Down,' he
he sat down very suddenly. I didn't
show my pistol to him nor his mate,
who-come in soon after."
Schiller turned over to the police
the ship's papers and 966 in money he
had taken from .the captain.
He declared he had planned, with
liner. The Cunard plot- was not car
ried out, he Baid. because his confed
erates "got cold feet.'*
Schiller said his real name was
Clarence Hudson, that his father was
an Englishman and had married a
German woman, and that he was born
in Petrograd. There his parents sepa
rated, he said, and\he went to Ger
many to live with his mother.
At the' outbreak of the war he said

position at a submarine plant at Cum

University of Michigan, died at his

As one of the foremost educators of
his time Dr. James Burrlll Angell had
the incidental distinction of being the
oldest coHege president in point of
service in the United States. With his
combined terms as head of the Uni^|_
versity of Vermont and the University
of 'Michigan he had been a college
president for forty-eight years. He
was a pioneer in the great system of

uates, 2,000 of whom were women.
Born ln Soiuate, R. I., Jan. 182S»
James Angell served during his early
manhood as a farm hand on his fath-r ^1
er's estate and attended' Brown Uni
versity. At 24 years he was invited to
become a professor of modern lan
•guages in the university. Among stu
dents ln his classes were Richard
Olney and John Hay. %-,
Engsgsd in Educational Work.T^^
During the later years of his work
at Brown, Professor Angell wrote edi
torials for the Providence Journal and
found this so much .to his liking that
he abandoned hla academic work to -.
become editor of the paper.
An incident occurred at ttila-:-ttB» :'J
that demonstrated his Insistence trpott'''
"plain, unvarnished truth." His for*'
mer student, John Hay, upon gradua
tloh, from coMtfge, had taken up

colored and refusing to print earagger-*

"Give us the facts," he demande#J|%'
"without embellishment."
Angell remained ln rharge of the'
Journal during the civil war period,
unfailingly loyal to the government,,
but at the conclusion of the strife he
accepted a call from the University of
Vermont to become its president. This,
in 1R66, was two years before Dr.
Charles W. Elliot received his appoint*""^
ment to Harvard.
Becomes President of Michigan.
After five years in Vermont Dr.
Angell gave way to Insistent calls from
Michigan and accepted the presidency
of the state university there in 1871.

dent body Increased from 1,207 to 6.188.
The annual appropriations rose from
33,000 to $660,000. The faculty grew
from thirty-nine members to 400. 1
"I am frequently asked how I sc- 'i?M
count for this phenomena! jrrnwfb,"
explained President Angell modestly?*
"It Is due In large measure, I think,
to the excellcnce of our faculty."
His fellow-educators. hov«ver. be
stow a larger measures of credit upon
Dr. Angell. Dr. Flnley, of the New
Tork state board of education, says:
"President Angell has put the lower
rung of the college within reach of
every high school graduate in Mich
igan, to give him every incentive to
climb for higher education. The
mechanism has grown under his hands
until it has become the largest and
most complete of its kind."
Angell a* a Diplomatiat.
As a diplomat. Dr. Angell gained in*
ternatlonal distinction. He was sent
by president Hay as minister to
China ln 1680-31. During this time he
acted as commissioner in negotiating
important treaties. He was appointed
by President McKlnley as minister to
Turkey in 1897. His public serrica,
also Included appointment* to the in-'.Vr

deed waterways from the great lake*
to tho sea.
Mr. Angell haa been in frall health
for more than a year. For several
months he had been almost blind. On
