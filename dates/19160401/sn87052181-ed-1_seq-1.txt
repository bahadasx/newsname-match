County Old Trails Meeting.
James C. Wonders of the depart

tho United States Department of Agri
culture has completed a survey for a
system of roads In Howard county

of a 16-foot macadam highway from
Fayette to Stelnmctz on the Chicago
& Alton Railroad. This road will bo
about eight miles long. Ho will fur
thor recommend a rock road from this
road to Glasglow and to Armstrong,
these two roads to be sjnglo track
rock roads, about nine feet'ln width.
The other rock roads to bo recom
mended will be tho crossstate high
Way from Fayette to Rocheport, a dis

CONFESSED AN OLD CRIME
Dying Missourlan Tells Preacher of
Murder and Robbery Committed
Thirty-Four Years Ago.
Tho confession of James Ambrose,
who is said to bo on his death bed at
his homo six miles south of New
Franklin, that ho robbed and killed a
fisherman of tho name of Totem in
1881, lias caused much surprise in that
community. Ambroso called n local
preacher to his bedside the other
night and confided his secret, which
ho had guarded theso thirty-five years.
When asked why ho killed the man
It is said he told the following story:
"Toters sent for me one day and
asked that I write a letter to his
bi other, who was In nn Eastern state.
Teters was living on that island out
there in tho river. He had been mak
ing his living by fishing. I told him
that I could not write, but that I
would tako tho letter to my home and
have It written for him." The letter
to tho brother contained a sum ot
money.
"On the way over the money became
too great a temptation for me and .1
returned and killed Teters. After get
ting about $3,000, I placed him In his
home and burned everything."
The coroner's jury returned tho ver
dict that Teters met his death by ac
cidental flro and no search was ever
made.

Three hundred mechanics and car
builders employed by the United Rail
ways, the St. Louis traction company,

wago Increase of 5 cents an hour had
been lefused by tho company.
Lead at Highest Mark.
Lead ore reached tho highest mark
on record recently when It sold for a
$95 basis SO per cent metallic lead.
This will mean a settlement figuro of

guuon, aro outer than is generally
thought. Leaving out of account tho
early attempts of a Duteh nlivHtrfot
In 1620 and tho Englishman Symons
in liii it will come as a surprlso
to many that tho Americans in tho
War of Independence, In 1773, endeav
ored to mako tho first submarine at
tack. Though this attempt was not suc
cessful, tho Idea was never since lost
sight of. Fulton offered Napoleon a
submarine ot his Invention for tho
contemplated invasion of Great Bri
tain, and a German engineer, Wil
helm Bauer, In 1850, camo forth with
plans for a submarine by which, as
stated by Burgoync, an English writer
on marltimo subjects, "tho solution of
tho problem ot submarlno navigation
was promoted to a higher degreo than
by any other inventor."
Germany Held Back.
Bauer's attempt to attack tho Dan
ish Act with his "brandtaucher" ("firo
diver"), it is true, proved a failure, tho
craft foundering in Kiel harbor. How
over, his boat was rescued in 18S7 and
now stands in the courtyard of tho
Berlin Museum ot Oceanography, a
lasting monument of Bauer's inven
tive genius. Tho Swedish engineer
Nordenfeldt. about thirty years ago,
completed tho Invention of tho mod
orn submarlno In Its leading lines.
Tho problem ot submarlno naviga
tion has ever slnco been on the order
of tho day, tho French marine being
tho first to undertake methodical tests
Intended to promoto tho development

Germany (In 1905) among tho last
wero slow in following suit. As long
nB there wero no really sultablo sub
marines nvailablo, thero was In fact
no harm In observing a wlso reserve,
wbllo other nations wero spending
tlmo and money on costly experi
ments. Events go to show that the
German navy has known how to mako
up for any delay In this respect.
Many Problems Involved.
A submarlno to bo really suitable,
should be especially seaworthy, being
able not only to sail on tho surfneo,
but to stand tho enormous water pres
sure at considerable depth. Its hull,
therefore. Is mado ot highly resistant
steel plates. An ovotdal or lengthy
olllpsoldal shnpo Is most convenient.
Tho problem of propulsion is ono of
tho most Important. Whilo tho uso of
tho snmo typo of motor for submarlno
navigation and sailing at tho surface
would bo satisfactory, It Is for many
reasons preferred to propel the craft
by mean- of nn electric motor (fed
from accumulators) when submerged,
using a steam engine, gasollno or.
preferably, a Diesel (oil) motor for
surfaco navigation. A speed ot 10-11
knots Is all that Is required below wa-

ter, whereas at tho surface, 18-20
knots per hour aro reached by modern
submarines, the radius of action,
without replenishing tho olltanks, be
ing 5,000 to 7..000 miles.
Tho torpedo Is to tho submarlno
what tho projectile Is to tho gun. Each
ot tho Inter typo ot German subma
rine is fitted with ten to twelvo tor
pedoes nnd six torpedo tubea (four
ahead and two astern) thus allowing
tho torpedoes to bo fired, it desired, in
quick succession.
Fearful Strain on Men.
Tho diving power of tho submarine
of courso Is ot tho highest Importance
Sufficient water having been admitted
to immerso tho boat and causo only
tho conning tower to protrude from
tho surface, tho horizontal rudders aro
acted on, thus overcoming the last
traces of buoyancy. In order again
to rise to the surfneo, the water Is
driven out by compressed air and tho
horizontal rudders are set working.
Tho most difficult problem, how
over, is tho problem ot seeing and ob

LUXURY IN PURITAN DAYS
At no time, of courso, was luxury
completely absent from America. Men
spend when tho purso Is full, oven
though tho purso be small. Not all
tho sumptuary laws of seventeenth
century Massachusetts could prevent
sober Puritans from launching Into
extravagance; from purchasing ap
parel "woolen, silko or lynnen. with
laco on it, silver, goldo. silko or

Into embroidered doublets with slashed
sleeves, into "gold or silver girdles,

disapproval of John Hancock's "show
and extravagance In living," of his
French nnd English furniture, his
dances, dinners, carriages, wlne-cel-lars
and lino clothes. Washington
