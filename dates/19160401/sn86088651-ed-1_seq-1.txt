Incorporated at Albany, N. Y.
By Associated press
New York. April 1 Manufacturers
of automobiles connected with the na
tional automobile chamber of com
merce announced Friday their decis
ion to Inc orporate a Company with an
"ultimate capital of from IS.Oon.iinn
to IIO.ooO.iioO" to produce gasoline
and other products of petroleum, with
the purpose of "demonstrating that
gasoline can be produced and sold at
a profit at a price somewhat lower
than now prevailing and within the
means of all users of automobiles and
motor boats."
Conferences of automobile manufac
turers and men engaged In oil produc
tion have been held here during Mie
past few daya and have been attended
by Alfred Reives, general manager of
the automobile chamber; S. I. Miles,
manager of the New York and Chica
go attomoblle shows, and John A. Roy
si. an oil man.
In a statement given out at the r.f
flees of the automobile chamber ot
commerce today, Mr. Royal sail:
"We shall at the very least demon
strate that no further Increase In the
price of oil is necessary and so pro
tect the business of the automobile
makera and their millions of Invested
capital."
The new venture had a good reason
for existence, according to Mr. Miles,
who said consumers are paying at the
rate of H57,H.0'iO a year more for oil
than they were paying In August. 1!'1.
The proposed company filed Incor
l4ration papers In Albany rrlday.
