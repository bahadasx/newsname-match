tisans working for thera and getting

One of the pleasant features of the
day was the work of the domestic
science department in the high school.

table refreshments for the election
officers. The lunch consisted of cream
of clam soup, tuna fish salad, birds
in nests, asparagus tips in timbals and

The third meeting of the Art club
of the eight grade was held last even
ing in the eighth grade school room.
It was largely attended and eight new
members were admitted.
There was no program owing to the
school meeting held last time. To
occupy spare time they had ten min
utes parlimentary practice. Those pre
sent decided that they would have a
debate. The question was, resolved:
"That a cabbage patch Is of more
value than a carrot patch." The Judges
were Rhoda Lamb, Rita McVeigh and
Louis Merver. Those on the negative 1
side put up the best argument and
therefore won the debate. j
A business meeting was held next
to prepare for the meeting next month. I
Those who are to edit the "Weakly j
Worry Knot" for the next meeting are i
Cornelious Murphy and Clifford Bris-j
sell. The president of the organiza
tion also arranged the program for
next time. Part of the time will be
occupied In sketching on the hoards.
It is assured that the next meeting
will be the most interesting of any
yet held by this club. It is almost
needless to announce that an indoor
baseball game is to be played by the
pupils of the eighth grade next Tues
day evening. All the business people
ot Tonopah knew It last night, and
very few escaped buying tickets. After
the meeting the teams of the grade
spent an hour and a half In hard practising.
