By Associated t'rc.'S
El Paso, Texas, April l.J —The cap
ture of Francisco Villa by the flying
squadrons of Americas cavalry
searching the Sierra Madre mountains
is believed by army officers at For'
Rliss to be only a question of days.
His forces scattered into smai
lands after their smashing defeat c
Wednesday by forces led by Colonel
Dodd, Villa is reported to-day to havj
sought, safety in hiding in some re
cesses of the continental divide. Th
bandit's injured leg, said to have bee>
broken by a gunshot wound, or a fa
from a horse, will doubtless preveit
him from making any long flight ov.
the rugged mountains.
Rc|x>rte<l Captured
That Villa already had been cai
tured and was being brought back t
he army base at Casas Grandes, w:
report heard here to-day but it w
ot credited in official quartet
T exican Consul Andres Garcia had 1
rtord of any further engagements b>
tween the American troops and ?')!
forces.
While the hunt for Villa contlnuf
General Pershing will continue h
operations against the tleeing bands ■
Villa men to prevent their concentr;-
.ion and to destroy them.
The fact that three days ha
elapsed since the smashing blow d
tivered at the Villa band in the vail
of Santa Mara, without any furth
news from General Pershing, h
given birth to the most cxtravaga'
speculation and rumors.
The chief argument of time is th
If Villa was as desperately injur
as reported he should be by now
the ban Is of his pursuers. Hut oth<
retort by pointing out the w
character of the country in which
is hiding and the fact that mosi
the natives of the mountains arc si
to do all they can to baffle the Am
ican soldiers by giving them false
formation.
All Depends on Speed
Everything apparently depe
upon the speed witli which Villa
able to move. If his injuries h;
forced him to seek safety in the moi
tains of the divide, it is believed tl; .
he cannot escape capture although o
may elude his enemies for many d. s
yet. On the other liands, if he has
been able to push east or southeast, t>e
ought by this time to have reachen a
country where traveling is com
paratively easy, water and food plein
ful and his adherents numerous.
The one thing that seems reas"
nbly certain is that before the cl
of to-day or to-morrow at the lat
it must be definitely known if Vill
a disabled and deserted fugitive m
the mountains, or if he has again v >
freedorp from the. cordon thriyr
about him and is maintaining
flight southward. In the height o
excitement caused by the news ot •
battle of Pan Geronime, interest. I is
temporarily faded here in the questi ~.
of the use of the Mexican railroads
for transporting supplies to General
Pershing's columns. Apparently the
solution of this problem is still far
from found. A good deal of curiosity
has been aroused over the failure of
any train to arrive at Juarez o\ei the
Northwestern Railroad for a >veef No
