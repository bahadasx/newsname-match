EL PASO, April 1?The capture of Francisco'-Villa
by the flying squadron of American cavalry searching the
Sierra Madra mountains is believed by army officers at
Fort Bliss to be only a question of days.
His forces scattered into small bands after their, smash!-,
ing defeat on Wednesday by forces led by Colonel Dodd,
Villa is reported today to have sought safety in hidingin
some recesses o f the continental divide. The bandit's|mi
jured leg, said to have been broken by a gun shot wouni
or a fall from a horse will doubtless prevent him fronS
making any long flight over long mountains.
That Villa had already been captured and was being!
brought back to the army base as Casas Grandes wasTjf^
port heard here today but it was not credited in. official
quarters.
Mexican consul Garcia had no word of any further'eiij!
gagements between the American troops and Villa force's*
While the hunt for Villa continues General Pershii?g
will continue his operations against the fleeing band of
Villa men to prevent their concentration and to destroy
them- General George Bell, Jr., commanding the'ajrm$
base here meanwhile is moving forward supplies to t
front via Columbus so that the American army may

tails of the brush between American
cavalrymen and a-.band of Villa follow
ers. Bhow that Col. Dodcl led bis Sev
enth and Tenth cavalry In a smashing
ride from the north towards Guerrero
when he learned of the presence thtru
of the Villa forces, covering the 56
m:iee Intervening in 17 hours. Gen
?ral Pershing said he arrived there at
6 o'clock, going into action immediate
ly.
Several Villa prisoners were taken
in the engagement, the exact number
not being indicated in reports receiv
ed here.
The Villa flight after the engage
ment was an utter rout, arms and
equpment being thrown away. The
dead and wounded Villa soldlerB were
lying about the field over which the
Americana fought, and Col. Dodd's
report said that perhaps the estimate
of 80 killed was low.
Late rsports indicate that Villa had
separated his 500 men into small
bands, each fleeing in a different di
rection, and that the bandit himself,
with a few chosen followers, was. be
ing Jolted over the mountain roads In
an attempt to reach a hiding place.
It was asserted In the dispatches
that despite the ardous mountain
march of the Americans, the advance
guard crept up through arroyas be
yond the Villa outposts before they
were discovered and that the Ameri
can Springfield rifles mowed down the
Mexicans as they sprang from their
pallets.
Villa himself was In a llttlo tent
In the rear of the encampment and
took no activo part In the engage
ment, leaving direction of his troops to
General Hernandez.
The desolation of the country in
which the engagement was fought,
and. the difficulties in communicating
are shown in the fact that Col.
Dodd's report did not reach headquar
ters of General Pershing at Colonia
for more than 48 hours.
It was a complete surprise to the
VUla force, which had entered into a
celebration of Its victory over the
Carranza garrison the <lay/before.
Soon sfcsr the action began the
Mexlcons were breaking for cover. For
10 miles the running fight that began
at Guerrero was continued and aban
doned only when the division of the
retriatlng forces into numerous small
bodies made pursuit impossible.
Col. Dodd reported that he had cap
