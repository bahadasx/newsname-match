Our Parish Rally
By Abbeville High School Students.
In this age of enlightenment
when civilization is making such
rapid progress, everything depends
upon education, the importance of
which increases with the flight of
years. It has been conceded by
the leading men of this State that
the salvation of Louisiana or the
future standing of any State de.
pends upon education. Therefore
any thing that tends to advance
the cause of education is of the
greatest value to the State. Today
the states that have the most in
fluence in national affairs are those
that are making the most progress
along educational lines. The par
ochial interest in schools should
be paramount to that of the State
after careful consideration the
Parish rally has been determined
as the most efficient means for ac
quiring a higher educational stand
ard. The advantages of our Par.
ish rally are numerous, some of
which I will endeavor to enumerate
in the following paragraphs.
Competition is created among
the pupils, thereby causing them
to take more interest not only in
one but every branch of their
school work. It causes them to
take a review of all the practical
subjects. They become more em.
cient in Mathematics. Spelling and
English as well as Athletics. This
competition inspires each partici
pant with a desire to do better than
I any other and at least causes them
to do their very best. The teachers
also, in order to keep up the stand
ard of the school.' make every
effort though it may require a good
0 deal of extra work, to obtain the
best results and win out in the
0 end. It also serves to show the
y teachers and pupils in one section
h of the Parish what the teachers
0 and pupils in the other section are
doing. Above all it increases the
d scholarship, causing each and every
d one to be more skillful in their
work. This incentive is apt to
g awaken the inert and stupid to
'o their real position in the class and
cause them to endeavor to do better.
From a social standpoint, the
