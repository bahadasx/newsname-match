LEWES, Del., March 31. Ernest

tured the British steamer Matoppo
and terrorized Us crew of fifty-six
men on Wednesday night shortly
efter th ship had sailed out of New
York harbor for Vladlvoitock with
railroad supplies for the Russian gov
ernment, declared today that he was
a spy for the German government.
Weary from excitement undergone
In his efforts to escape from the
steamer yesterday after he had held
the crew In his power with pistols
ell of Wednesday night, he threw
himself upon a cot in the Lewes jail
early today and sought sleep.
"Tea, I am a spy for the German gov

It or not- il makea no difference to ire.
I a-ot my Instructions from the German
government to go aboard the ship and
to prevent Its cargo from reaching
Ruasla. I could have blown it up, but
the captan'a plea for his wife and daugh
ter was too much for me and I hadn t
the heart to do it. I am ready to take
the consequences, but I ask that they
keep me ashore Instead of sending me
back to the ship for the raptaln to take
me in charge."

Hchlller had been told that as his dar
ing exploit occurred outside the thre

aken to British possessions In the West
Indies for trial for piracy. Federal au

Schiller was reluctant to tell his history.

mesiafcp from Lieutenant Colonel P.
C. Cabell, General Pershing's chief
of staff, said Villa was carried away
In a carriage after the hattle,

Colonel Cabell In his inesoauo con

under Colonel George A. Podd had de
cisively defeated 600 VUllstas. killing 31,
Including General Klineo Hernandex.
Pablo Ixipex, Villa's lieutenant, who was
reported to have been killed In the Co

riously wounded.
ttlark at Dunn.
Colonel Dodd attacked the Villa camp
with 400 members of the Seventh and
Tenth cavalry at dawn, completely sur
prising the Mexicans and forcing them
Immediately on the defensive. A five
hour running fiitht follawed and Inst re
ports from Colonel lHdd were that the
American troopers were close behind the
Vlllistss. who were fleeing further Into
the mountains.
It was Indicated that the Mexican
forces were somewhere northwest of the
railroad at the last reporta to General
Perslilng'a headquarters. Before the bat
tle the American forces marched through
out the late day and all night, making a
march of fifty-five miles through the
chill mountain night In seventeen hours.
Several Takea Prisoners.
Several Villa prisoners were taken in
the engagement, the exact number not
being Indicated In reports received here.
Also a number of Carranxa soldiers, who
were being held with the bandits' forces
awaiting execution, were liberated and
are assisting the American forces In tho
pursuit.
The Villa flight after the engagement
was an utter rout, arms and equipment
being thrown away by the Mexicans In
their haate. Two maehlne guns, a quan
tity of ammunition and supplies were
captured by Colonel Dodds' forces.
The dead and woundecUaf.'llllstas were
lying about the fl?ld over which the
Americana fought and Colonel Dodds' re
ports said that perhna. the estimate of
thirty killed wss low. The names of the
Americans wounded were not contlnod
In the dispatch, but 1 was reported that
none of the men mi in a dangerous
condition. 4
Later reporta indicate that Villa ha
separated his W men Into small banda
each, fleeing in a different direction nnd
that the bandit hlrrwelf with a few
chosen followers were helnr Jolted, over
mountain roads in a light carriage in an
attempt to reach a hiding place.
entrlea Are Borprlsed.
While few details were given in the
dlspatchej it was asserted that, despite
the arduous mountain march of the
Americans, the advance guard crept up
through arroyos beyond the Villa out
pocts before they were discovered and
that tha American Sprinfle d ilflea mowjd
the Mexicans down as they sprang from
their pallets.
Villa, himself, was In a little tent on a
knoll In the rear of the encampment and
It was asserted took no active part In the
engagement, leaving the direction of his
troops to General Hernandes.
The dispatches did not state definitely
that Villa was wounded In the engage
ment, but rather intimated that ho bad
t een wounded previously and was nursing
his injuries at the time of the attack.
This Is taken here to mean either that
he was wounded, ns has been reported In
the attack on Columbus, or In the minor
skirmish with the Carransa forces In tho
vicinity of Namaqulpa early Inst week.
The isolation of the country In which
tho engagement was fought and the dif
ficulties in communication and trans
Hon are iliovtn by the fact that Colonel
Dodds' report did not reach the heal
qi:arters of General Pershing at Colonla
for more than forty-eight hours.
