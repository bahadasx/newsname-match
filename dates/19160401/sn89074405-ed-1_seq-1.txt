(Herald Special Service.)
Crookston, Mian., April 1.—More
than half the width of weat Robert
street, near the Sampson's addition
bridge over the Red Lake river, slid
into the river this morning, closing
the street to all traffic.
The slide Is ten rods long and re
pairs will necessitate the extension
of the piling and several train loads
of stone for anchoring. The street
will be closed for', weeks and perhaps
months as it will take thousands of
yards of dirt to bring the street up to
grade again.
Fears are entertained that the slide
is not ended and that two buildings
but a few feet away may also slide
into the river. The underlying qulok
sand and much water caused the dis
astrous slide.
Alarm at num.
Fargo, N. D., April l.—With a rise
of 13 inches over night, flooding a
big added area in both Moorhead and
Fargo. Red river flood conditions here
today assumed more alarming propor
tions.
There is no hope for the crest be
ing reached for several days.
Removed in Boats.
In Moorhead many families in the
flat dlstriot were removed from their
homes in boats this morning, the
rapid rise of water during the night
catching them unaware of danger.
In Ffergo, street car traffic in one
section has been disrupted, and a big
portion of southern residence district
has been cut off, except by a olrcuitl
ous route, from the business section.
The ice is being dynamited near the
Alteration plant to prevent a gorge
forming.
Tracks Washed Out.
Wahpeton, N. D., April 1.—Flood
conditions unprecedented prevail in
the Red river here, with the flood
waters washing over the rails of the
Northern Pacific bridge, and Just two
or three feet below the Great North
ern bridge rails with twelve miles
of the Milwaukee line between White
Rock and Fairipountinun

Last night.aralasofbetweenebt

flood tide has not yet been attained,
because both the Ottertall and Bols
du Sioux rivers are carrying a tre
mendous flood of water into the Red
river.
The flats east of Breckenridge,
Minn., have been flooded for miles, a
veritable lake being created there.
Local observers see no hope for the
receding flood till Sunday night or
Monday,! with the river hourly attain

Extensive dynamiting was resorted
to last night between Abercromble

tVould lfave to be Total fail
ure to Injure Business in
... State Says Finch.
That North Dakota will enjoy one
of the most prosperous yean in the
history of the state is the opinion of
BL B. Finch of this city, who has Just
returned by way of Edmonton, Alta.,
and Winnipeg, Man., from Pasadena,
Cal., where he has spent the past win
ter.
"Last year," said Mr. Finch, "North
Dakota farmers began the season un
der very unfavorable conditions. But
they harvested a bumper crop last
fall, and received a good price for
their produce.
"On account of this they are be
ginning this season under very favor
able conditions, and unless there is a
total crop failure, this will be a splen
did year.
Don't Need Iaige Crop.
"We don't need the large crop or
the hlgh prlcea we received'last year
to make it a. suooessful season," he
declared.
Conditions in California and In the
south generally have been good this
winter, he declared. A large number
of tourists from North Dakota and
Minnesota spent the winter there,
with the result that business received
a stimulus from their presence.
"Tourist Crop" Good.
"Pasadena arid places of that de
scription depend largely on the hum
ber of tourists who-visit there, and
the tourist crop' this year was excep
tionally good."
Throughout the whole of western
Canada prospects are fine for a very
successful season, he declares. Al
though the war has to a slight extent,
left its mark on business, it has im
proved greatly during the past few
months.
Conditions In that part of Canada
have never been better for the raising
of a bumper crop, he states. Heavy
snows the. past winter will result in
plenty of moisture to aid in the grow
ing season. Fanners and busln
men in general are all optimistic.

WORD OE CHASE
fOROUTLAWS
Official Washington Pleased
With Work of Colonel
Dodd's Men.
COMMANDER IS
FEARLESS MAN
Congratulations Sent Persh
ing and Dodd—Baker
Makes Statement.
Washington, April 1.—Officials
anxiously await further news from
Funston anent Dodd's pursuit of Villa.
Army officers believed it probable that
In the forty-eight hours since the
fight there had been further skirmish
es with the hard-pressed outlaws, and
possibly that even Villa himself, had
been found.
Delay In receipt of General Persh
ing's report was ascribed by war de
partment heads to the great distance
trom the border and difficulties or
communication. The scene of the
fight waa about 225 miles south of
Juares. While on the railroad line,
General Pershing was thought to have
forwarded his dispatch by courier to
the signal corps telegraph lines.
End In Sight.
Belief was expressed in all quarters
that the successful end of the Ameri
can expedition was in sight. Officials
believed that Dodd's victory, if fol
lowed promptly by the death or cap
ture of Villa himself, would go far
toward aiding in restoration of peace
in Mexico. They believed the rout
would discourage outlaws generally
and deter further desertion from Car
ranza's army.
In his telegram to General Funston,
forwarded here by the latter from
Fort -Sam Houston, Texas, General
Pershing indicated probable results of
the American victory.
"-With VUla pexnianeaUy«44aafcled,
Lopes wounded and Hecnandes dead,
the, blow administered la a serious one
to Villa's band/*, he said.
The Lopes referred to was believed
here to be Pablo Lopez, leader of the
Santa Ysabel massacre," in which sev
enteen Americans were,killed.
Baker's Statement.
Secretary Baker issued the follow
ing statement:
"The success of Colonel Dodd in
catching up with the retreating ban
dits and dispersing them shows the
value and effectiveness of the careful
preparations made by General
Funston, as well as the dash and vigor
with which Colonel Dodd himself, and
the members of his command have
undertaken their task.
"It is a matter of great gratification
to us all that the first encounter is
so decisive and that our own troops
have suffered so slightly. The effect
on both sides of the border will un
doubtedly be great, it will allay ap
prehension on the American side by
showing the rapidity and effectiveness
with which our army act, and
among the Mexican people it will
show the singleness of our purpose
and discourage other bandits from
sympathetic demonstration.
"This comes as a very adequate
answer to those who feared that It
would be a long and painful pursuit
before we overtook the marauders
and give strong ground to hope that
the object of the expedition can be
accomplished speedily."
Unstinted Praise,
Unstinted praise was given in all
quarters to Col. Dodd, the veteran
cavalry officer, who rode with his
command continuously for seventeen
hours, covered fifty-five miles and
then engaged in a five-hour fight.
Colonel Dodd is 64 years of age, and
has been in the saddle practically ever
since the troops were ordered to the
border. He will retire on account of
age next July. Appointed to the mili
tary academy from Pennsylvania he
graduated in 1876. He joined the
Third cavalry during the Apache out
break in Arizona, fought during the
Indian campaign in Oklahoma, in the
Chicago riots in 1864 and distinguish
ed himself during the Spanish-Amer
ican war, participating in the battle
of San Juan and in many fights in the
Philippines.' He Is declared to have
been the first to suggest the now
famous "Monkey drill"' for cavalry
training.
For some time Colonel Dodd had
charge «f recruiting at Columbus bar
racks, Ohio, and Is credited by
Adjutant General McCain with hav
ing done much to reduce army deser
tions, although a strict disciplinarian.
Among the classmates at West
Point of Col. Dodd. were Col. Slocum,
commanding the Thirteenth cavalry,
which was raided by Villa at Colum

AIR RAD ON
ENGLAND 28
ARE KILED
Zeppelin Comes Down and
Crew is Captured—Ma
chines are Larger.
London, April 1—Twenty-eight were
killed and four wounded in an air raid
on England last night, officials stated
late this afternoon.
It also was officially announced that
a Zeppelin that raided the eastern
coast last night came down oft the
mouth of the Thames and was cap
tured by a British patrol.
There were five aircraft in the
squadron, all said to be bigger than
those in any previous raids. They
flew too high to be reached with guns.
They dropped about 90 bombs, but no
damage was reported.
PAVtNGPlAN
Improvement of Streets with
Gravel Instead of Cement
Endorsed.
The Grand Forks Commercial club
has at last agreed upon a paving
scheme which it is believed will be of
great benefit to the city if adopted.
The directors of the Commercial
club have discussed from time to
time the matter of using a new
method of treating the streets of the
city, namely the installing of con
crete curbs and gutters and paving
the streets with gravel instead of
cement and other hard paving.
Believed Cheaper.
The Commercial club men have
decided that it would not only be
cheaper to make such improvements
but that such improvement* would
be even superior in the residence por
tions. It is pointed out that the in
stalling of concrete curbs and gutters
would establish the berm space and
make a neat road line, while for auto
mobiles and other vehicles the grav
eled roads cannot be surpassed.
The committee having charge of
this- work is composed of Casper
Olson, W. H. Kelsey and W. H.
Shulze. The directors met with Sec
retary C. W. Graves a week ago and
instructed the good roads committee
to interview property owners in the
city and And some section interested
enough to try out the plan and the
committee would then co-operate with
that section in preparing a 'necessary
petition to be presented to the city
council.
Find Some Interested.
In compliance with these sugges
tions the good roads committee found
that residents of Vernon and Belmont
avenues between Eighth and Boule
vard avenues are interested in the
paving proposition and the committee
has secured from the city attorney a
proper petition and the same is now
being circulated.
If enough signatures are obtained
it will go to the city council asking
the city to establish grades, build
concrete gutters and curbs and pave
those two streets with gravel.
Graves Commends Plan.
Mr. Graves said today:
"This system of improving the
roads is much less expensive than
using concrete or blocks and if adopt
ed will enable us to have streets with
a good appearance and will give first
class paving for the residence dis
tricts."

El Paso. April 1.—A Chi

officials at Juarez states that
there is a report in Chihua
hua that Villa was captured
at Minaca. Confirmation is
impossible. American troops
are thought to be in that lo
cality.
San Antonio. April 1.—With
only a brief rest, Colonel Dodd's
cavalry, which Wednesday scat
tered Villa's band, has resumed
the hunt for the bandit leader.
No further reports were received
here of the actual fighting, al
though messages filed nbuirisy
and Friday have arrived.
DOUBT CONCERNING VILLA.
Some doubt la innasod con
cerning Villa. Pershing's reports
fail to state definitely. It Is rumor
ed here, that reports of his injury
were started to distract attention.
That Ms hand was spHt Wednes
day and that a m-ornniaUioa
will be hard with Dodi*a cavalry
trailing him, is conceded.
No supplies have yet been seufc
over tJw Mexican North ivesfc^n.
notwithstanding permission baa
been granted by Cairaaaa.
IMMEDIATE CAPTURE EXPECTED
El Paso. April 1.—Tbe captnro
of Villa is believed by army offi
cers to be only a matter of days.
Villa is reported seeking safety...
in the mountain fastness, follow
ing the scattering of Us tones.
The bandit's injured leg 'will
doubtless hinder a long flight.
That he is already captured is
rumored here.
Supplies continue to move by
automobile.
VILLA LOOTED TOWN.
El Paso. April 1.—Consul Gaswis
announced the receipt of a telegram
telling of a battle at Qaumu on
Monday. It says Villa waa shot
through the leg at that time, and
later looted the town. CkmWes
were heavy on both skies. The ap
proach of the American troops sav
ed the defeat of the Carranxa
troops.
El Paso. April l.-^Ths scene of Col
onel Dodd's victory is a broad valley
lying at the head of ths Rio Santa
Maria. On the west rise ths barren
foothills of the continental divide and
to the east is a trail made famous by
Villa, which leads through ths La
guna de Castilla dlstriot to ths 111
famed Stana Ysabel. It wu at the
latter place that Villa killed eighteen
American mining men. a crime which
sent a thrill of horror throughout the
United States and marked the begin
ning of what may be the end of his
blood-stained oaresr. It was toward
Santa Tsabel that he was believed to
