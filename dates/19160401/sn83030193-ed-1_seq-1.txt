PLOT TO BLOW UP
SHIP AT PIER HERE
Maioppo's Captor Tells of Bold.
Conspiracy to Wreck
Munitions Vessel.
PLANNED TO SINK LINER.
Schiller Says Aides Backed
Down in Plot to Capture
Big Ciinarder.
To save himself from deportation
to Great Rrttaln and execution ns a
plrnte and a spy, Ernest Schilling,
who took the British freighter
Matoppo from lier crew of flfty-six
and.cpmnwuidtd.hjirfor a day, made
a' clean ,breast to-day to the Federal
and city authorities of his knowledge'
of bomb plots In this country and
their perpetrators.
Among other things he confessed
planning a nearly successful effort to
blow up a munition ship at a Man
hattan pier. When he Is arraigned
In Jefforson Market Court to-morrow
this is tho charge which will prob
ably be pressed against htm. Deputy
Commissioner Scull sent out several
men In a hurry this aftornoon to find
some of tho men mentioned In Schill
er's confession.
Included In tho "Lono Pirate's"
statement Is his regretful admission
that the capturo of the Mntoppo was
an afterthought, by way of consola
tion for the failure of his subordinate
conspirators to back him up In cap
turing tho big Cunard liner.
The statement that the plot to take
and blow up a Cunardcr failed was a
grent relief to the authorities. They
had some Information three weeks
ngo of such a plot, In which' Schiller
was concerned, and at Intervals had
him shadowed. Then they lost track
of him and, until his statement to
day, they have feared word .would
come thnt a Cunarder hud been de
stroyed at sea, especially since there
was a report the conspirators had
sailed on a Urltlsh ship last Sat
urday. Schiller was allowed to spin his
yarn of tho capture of the Matoppo
to reporters to-day, but ncft to tell
anything of his other movements or
plots. Ho sat in his shirt-sleeves on
a bench in tho trial room at Head
quarters making the recital. At dra
matic points', as, for Instance, where
he told how he, with four days' beard
and bloodshot eyes and two revolvers,
confronted the captain, ho stood up
and enacted tho scene.
3AY8 SHIP'S OFFICERS OBEYED
HIM MEEKLY.
In substance his tale was as It has
been told before, but there were Illumi
nating new details. When he hod tho
officers all gathered In tho captain's
room, ho said, he could not And the
key. He told them to stay there on
pain of death and went out to explore
the ship. They all obeyed ordors
meekly.
"I mi", on officer on deck," he Bald,
"told him the ship waa now a Gor
man prize and asked for his revolver.
He gave It to mo at once, and at my
roquest led me to the wireless room.
We waked the operator and had him
disconnect tho apparatus, I thon
sent both operators to the captain's
room. I sent the officer for an axe,
which ho brought promptly, I told
him to smash tho apparatus, He was
so nervous he couldn't swing tho axe
and I had to do It myself. When I
went back to the chart room, I found
tho boys shivering, so I ordered the

Embalmer Kane, Who Says
He Buried All, Only
Digs Up $7,800.
All the activities of the District At
torney's office were devoted to-day to
searching for the $1,100 which disap
peared from tho $9,000 roll of bills
handed to Embalmer Eugene O. Kane
by Dr. Arthur Warren Walte, the
poisoner, on March 20. The roll of
mqney when dug up from a holo
under a tree on William Gillette's
estate at Orient Point, L. I., yestor
day by Detective Cunnlffe counted
up only $7,800.
Kane, Insists he never counted the
money after Dr. Walto handed It to
him and that the $7,800 roll Is the
Idontlcal roll he received. Dr. Walto
assorts he gave Kano $9,000 and there
Is no doubt about his cashing a check
for $9,300 shortly boforo ho mot Kano
on Marcli 20.
Kane, at tho request of the District
Attorney, produced alt his account
books and bank books at the Criminal
Courts Building' to-day. His employer,
John S. Potter, the undertaker, also
produced all his books and records.
Theso throw no light on tho mlBslng
$1,200 which, for some unexplained
reason, appears to be a matter of
great ImiKrtanco In tho District At
torney's office.
It was learned to-day that tho In
vestigation of Walto's action has led
Into suspected attacks upon tho llfo
of his wife. Detective Schlndler has
gone to Grand Ruplds to question
Mrs. Walte about certain attacks of
Illness which she suffered during the
winter and to seo If these attacks
had any relation to certain purcbuses
of candy mado by tho doctor In the
vicinity of his home.
Outsldo of the hunt fur the miss
Ipg $1,200 there was a slacking up of
work on the Walto case In tho Dis
trict Attorney's ofllco to-day. Cun
nlffe brought Kane and tho munuy
In at 10 o'clock and told about dig
ging up the hidden bankroll yester
day. On reaching Greenport the detec
tive and embalmer started for Orlunt
Point In an automobile. It got stuck
three miles out and they had to walk
back and hire a boat. Starting by
water they had to put tiack to Groon
port because the boat had no rudder.
They succeeded In getting a sea
worthy launch, and on landing walked
some distance Inland. Thero was an
old shack used as a dressing room
for bathers In summer. Nearby was
a grove of trees, oni conspicuously
tall. Under the sod a few paces from
the tree they found the sardine can
with tho money 'Inside wrapped In

FOUND ONLY $7,800 IN THE
BURIED ROLL.
Cunnlffe counted the roll three times
and could make but $7,800,
"You'ro 8hy, whore's tho other

"I told Judge Swann I mjver counted
