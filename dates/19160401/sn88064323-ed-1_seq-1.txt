CO,
"I never allow my children to
bring tales home from school,"
the mo her of a pupil once told
me. 4 I expect them to do as
they are t tdden and the teachei
will do t In rest ''
No, dear mother, teacher can
not, do the rest u n aid » d by you
She needs ycui help, and all the
h ![) your child's confidences can
give you. x
1 heaid another mother de
c'ai » :
"It's no use for Abel to bring
boota home. I've foigorten ail I
ever knew, and if I hadn't I've no
ume to help him Besides, I
think six hours of school work
enough for any boy or girl below
High School il tl ey and the
teacher m ike good use of school
hours, I'll risk any deficiency."
But that mother might have en
couraged Abel to bring books
home, if only to follow his prog
ress with pride, leaf by leaf.
She would not have wasted any
precious minutes talking ovei the
lessons while she made him
ready for bed. His interest, the
vital feature of school life, coil'd
have been ongagi d for ail time by
her interested sympathy in his
1 1 tt 1»! doing and achievements.
"Sonic say this is a fine teacher
we have now," a rural housew fe
was heard to remark to a neigh
bor. "1 don'-t know. Others cry
her down I never meddle with
school affairs. L bring up my
children to go to school and mind
he teacher, and my husband
votes for as good a Hiipetiruemi
tut as can be had. If our boyi
and girls grow up dunces, it's no
fault of ours. VVe do our duty by
them When I was young, my
fat.her aud mother told us if we
got punished at school we'd get
more when we got home. John
and I don't go as far as that, tail
we do plan to let the proper an
thorities look after educational;
matters."
Result: No sympathy betwern
parent and teacher, child and
school, pei imps little bet wem
teacher and that child and his
home. The parent knows noth
tug of the child's school life, ami
if pernicious, it is not remedied.
Superintendents are not infatli
ble, nor teachers. The parents
certainly have a duty —From
