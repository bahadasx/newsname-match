OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
The colonel's hat is in the ring,
but to most of us it looks too much
like a helmet.—Charleston News
and Courier.
When 2 per cent of the people
of the United States own 60 per
cent of the wealth, why should
the 60 per cent be taxed by a
high republican tariff to favor the
ownings of the 2 per cent?
James Bernard, of Bossburg,
one of the Colviile Indian chiefs,
after reading Congressman Dill's
speech in the house on the Indian
question, says that it is the first
instance he has found of a word
uttered by a white man in favor
of the Indian, and that it shows up
the workings of the Indian depart
ment correctly.
An appeal made to women in
1801 by New England paper man
ufacturers to save their rags is
recalled today by the department
of commerce in a circular urging
the country to hoard both paper
and rags to avert a threatened
shortage of paper-making mater
ials. It is declared the need is as
urgent now as then. A great
part of the paper thrown away
every day should be used over
again, the circular declares. The
paper saving crusade was sug
gested by paper manufacturers
themselves. Old paper brings
$11 per tun F. 0. B. Spokane.
Senator Lodge, who is consider
ably a standpatter, and a friend
of the big interests of the east,
says: "In my own opinion, with
the exception of the administra
tion of Buchanan, there has been
no administration in power which
has been so injurious to the United
States, both.at home and abroad,
as that now in control in Wash
ington."
Which shows that the passage
of the banking bill which pre
vents panics, and the change in
the tariff law which favors no
special industries, are keenly felt
by the men whose swollen for
tunes were gained at the expense
of the producing public. They
hated to go back to legitimate
competition again.
The democrats of Stevens coun
ty will observe Jefferson day,
April 13, by holding their county
convention in Colville, to select
24 delegates to attend the state
convention in North Yakima. May
2. The county convention will be
called to order at 2 p. m. After
the convention, a meeting of the
central committee will be held.
At 6:30 the annual Jefferson
dinner will be held at Masonic
temple, with seats for 150. County
Chairman P. Y. Wilson and Sec
retary P. L, Stonehouse, with sev
eral committees, have matters in
charge, and it is expected that
every precinct in the county will
he represented. The magnificent
success of the Jefferson dinner
last year, with its novel forms of
entertainment, and with good
speaking, will be hard to equal,
but it is said that several new
stunts are under way which will
please all who attend.
Republican newspapers are
combing the land with a fine
tooth comb in an effort to find a
"favorite son to run against P;P
in the coming campaign. They're
finding plenty who are willing to
tackle the job but none of a cali
bre to compare with Dill.
In the face of what Dill has
done and is doing there are none
who dare discredit him and it is
am using, to say the least, to note
liow the republican press exeilM
themselves for not supporting hin/
for re-election. Regardless of
polities, 0. 0. Dill is the best rep
resentative that the sth district
of Washington ever sent to th"
national eapitol. It should be
rioted that one lone democrat from
tlie republican state of Washing
ton has accomplished more in
The Friend
(Frank Cnn<)
A friend is a person who is "for you"
always, under any suspicions.
He never investigates you.
When charges are made against you,
he does not ask for proof; he asks the
accuser to clear out.
He likes you just as you are. He
does not want to alter you.
He likes your success, and your fail
ures endear you to him the more.
He is better than a lover, because he
is never jealous.
He wants nothing from you, except
that you be yourself.
He is the one thing with whom you
can feel safe. With him you can utter
your heart—its badness and its good
neas. You don't have to be careful.
There are many faithful wives and
husbands; there are few faithful friends.
Friendship is the most admirable,
amazing and rare article among human
beings.
Anybody may stand by you when you
are right; a friend stands by you when
you are wrong.
. The highest known form of friend
ship is that of the dog to his master.
You are in luck if you can find one man
or one woman on earth who has that
kind of friendship for you and fidelity
to you.
Like the shade of a great tree in the
noonday heat is a friend.
Like the home port, with your coun
try's flag flying, after long journeys, is
a friend.
A friend is an impregnable citadel of
refuge in the strife of existence.
It is he that keeps alive your faith in
human nature, that makes you believe
it is a good universe.
He is the antidote for despair, the
elixir of life, the tonic for depression,
the medicine to cure suicide.
When you are vigorous and spirited
you like to take your pleasures with
him, when you are in trouble you want
to tell him, when you are sick you want
to see him, when you are dying you
want him near.
You give to him without relunctance
and borrow from him without embar
rassment.
If you can live 50 years and find one
absolute friend, you are fortunate. For
of the thousands of human beings that
walk the earth, few are such stuff as
friends are made of.

cans in both houses have been ablt

stcr Review.
Chris McDonell, the well
known rancher north of Colville,
states that his experience with
democratic hard times has been
a severe lesson to him. Years
ago, under benificent republican
rule, he says that freight cars
were always available, and travel
ing freight agents were ready and
anxious to send freight cars of
any kind to the siding or station
for use of shippers, But now, af
ter three years of democratic ad
ministration, a freight car seems
to be harder to get than fine rai
ment or jewels, and while the
roads are busily carrying automo
biles and pianos to the down
trodden farmer, the man who has
wood to sell can haul it to Spokane
mi teams if ha wants to get it
there —for there are no freight
cars to be had.
In order to extend the facilities
of the parcel post service as rapid
ly as possible, and to give the pub
lic every possible advantage in
connection therewith, the post
offioe department is at present en
gaged in working out a system
whereby the producer and con
sumer of farm and dairy products
can be brought in direct communi
cation.
The Seattle postoffice has bean
designated by the department to
compile a list of names and ad
dresses of producers who desire
to sell country produce direct to
the consumer. Such a list will be
revised and reprinted at frequent
intervals, will be kept posted in
all pottoflet stations, and will be
delivered by carrier to any one
who desires to secure it.
Thi' list will contain tin' names
ami addresses of all persons who
have indicated to the postmaster
al Seattle that they are in a posi
tion to handle produce in this
manner, and wish to do so, to
gether with the character of the
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
produce they can furnish (under
appropriate headings such as
"butter,"' "eggs," "fruit," and
"general produce"), the prices
mid terms of payment, change of
price, and such other descriptive
matter or information it may be
necessary to furnish.
The list will be printed on or
about the first of each month, and
if a producer wishes his name to
remain on the list he shall so ad
vise tlu' postmaster not later than
the 20th of the month; otherwise
his name will not be reprinted.
'Phis is necessary in order that the
list shall not be encumbered with
unavailable names.
All parcel post mail received
during the morning is delivered
before night; all received during
the afternoon is delivered the
next morning. These facts must
be borne in mind by shippers so
that they may time their ship
ments to the best advantage, more
particularly when a shipment of
perishable goods is due to arrive
in the city on Saturday.
The idea is spreading that the
year 1916 will lie suimnerless.
The year 1816, the year after the
disastrous end of Napoleonic wars,
had scarcely enough summer to he
worth mentioning, and the theory
seemed to he that tile terrific
bombardments on European bat
lie fields are bound to have a sim
ilar effect upon weather condi
tions* next year. .June of lHlfi so
the story goes was a month of
IVosf and ice. Xew England,
Ohio and Pennsylvania were cov
ered with snow. .June 17 then
was a great snow storm, and flocks
of sheep were overwhelmed and
suffocated. The ice was an inch
thick on the Fourth of .Inly, and
■August 30th witnessed a heavy
Call of snow. Xot until after
September were the climatic con
ditions restored. The mil inn is
that history will repeal itself alt
er the passage of a century, and
tin' alarming thought in iliis con
nection is that if the Napoleonic
w;irs caused all the derangemeni
of meteorological conditions, then
the amount used in the present
war is likely to keep the tempera
ture iit 40 below zero at least all
next summer.- -Ex.

Wrighi Jr. of the division of
dairying at the Washington Stale
College, which is convincing evi
dence of the high quality of but

minion Creamery. The butter
made by the Old Dominion Cream
ery scored among the highest on
exhibition at the recent show of
the Northwest Dairy Products As
sociation held in Spokane. The
letter, in part, reads: "You will
note that your butter scored quite
high on quality, color and compo
sition. Your butter was one of
the high five which were counted
in determining which state won
the trophy for the best butter ex
hibit. This trophy, as you prob
ably know, was won by the state
of Washington, and we wish to
congratulate you oh making such
a high score. We were glad to
have had so many entries from the
state of Washington, and hope
that you will be with us again
next year at Pullman." In but

for that state. Following is the
