Germany Tries
To Get Italy To
Quit Her Allies
Information Comes
Out at Super War
Council Which Is
BeingHeld in Paris
BIG PLANS MADE
PARIS, March 30.—Germany
has been making desperate ef
forts to detach Italy from the
ranks of the allies. This was
learned today when the super
war council of the al ie«, one of
the most important canferences
in history, met for its first ses
sion at the foreign office today.
The information carne from a
most reliable Italian source. The
Germans, it was learned, plan
ned by shrewd propaganda and
by a triumph at Verdun to cre
ate such dissatisfaction in Italy
that the government would re
consider its play to help "dose
the steel ring" around the cen
trai empires, by joining in the
Paris program for concerted ac
tion.
Some hint of this German ef
fort evidently already has reach
ed the Paris public. The Italian
prime minister and foreign min
ister consequently received tre
mendous ovations en route to
the foreign office today.
The Germans learned of plans
for the super war council several
weeks ago. Alarmed at the pros
pects that the allies would frame
a program for the closest mil
itary, diplomatic and economie
collaboration for maximum of
fensive efficiency, the Kaiser de
cided on an attempt to take Ver
dun, believing the moral effect
of such a defeat on the allies
would halt the conference.
At the same time he sent a
shrewd bàiìù Of prùpàg&ùuiótS i
into Italy and began a campaign
designed to foment trouble in
Italv, in the German newspap
ers. The Germans particularly
feared that an important result
of the Paris conference would be
the appearance of Italian troops
How Liniment Agent "Worked"
Some Indiana County Residents
BLAIRSVILLE, March 30.
About three months ago a
smooth agent for a patent cure
ali liniment made a farm-to-farm
canvass of East Mahoning and
adjoining townships, and victim
ized nearly every farmer he vis
ited.
His pian was to leave a $1 bot
tle of liniment at each house.
East bottle had a little mark on
the label. The recipient was
permitted to use the liniment
down to the label mark free, but
if more was used, then the full
price of $1 was to be paid.
Of course everybody used
some of the liniment and recent
who plead guilty on the same
charge. Eva and Joe Cipriano,
who were found guilty of selling
liquor without a license, were
not sentenced, their case being
held over.
The March term of civil court
is now over. Judge Bautan, of
McKean Co., has been assisting
Judge Langham in a long list of
cases.
on other fronts, knowing that
the mountainous nature of much
of the Austro-Italian front pre
vents the use of ali Italy's forc
es.
The Italian government was
on the alert and took quick steps
to counteract the effect of this
German propaganda. The Ger
mans' failure to take Verdun
dealt a final blow to the scheme,
i
one of the most ambitious at
tempts to create a breach in the
ranks of the allies since the be
ginning of the war.
What will come out of the all
important conference that open
ed here today cannot be guessed.
It seems certain, however, that
one of the first public state
ments issued will inform the
world that the allies stand as
a unit against rejecting any
peace suggestions coming from
Berlin at the present time.
The conference of the entente
allies began this morning in the
great salon of the ministry of
foreign affairs where many oth
er historic meetings of diplo
matists have taken place.
The subject of the first sitting
is the military situation. That
is ali which may be said defin
itely, but it is probable that Gen.
Joffre, Earl Kitchener, Gen. Sir
Douglas Haig, Lieut. Gen. Count
Cadorna, Gen. Castelnau and
Gen. Roques, the new French
war minister, addressed the con
ference.
The entire company took lunch
at the ministry at noon. The af
ternoon session will be devoted
to consideration of the econom
ie resources of the allies.
VILLA WOUNDED AND NOT
WITH MEN, AIRMAN SAYS.
EL PASO. TEX., March 30.
Panello Villa was wounded in the
hip in the fight with the Ameri
can soldiers after the raid on
Columbus. He is now nursing his
wound somewhere in Mexico, not
far from the Mexican border,
liiuueii in the house of a fi lenti.
He is not with the band of his
followers that General Pershing
is hunting in the interior among
the fastnesses of the Sierra Ma
dre.
This information was brought
to E 1 Paso by F. W. Perez., Vii-
ly a collector visited the lini
ment samplers and requested
pavment. Ali who did not pay
will now visit Squire Steele Mc-
Ginity at Marion Center and pay
the dollar with added costs. Not
having a written contract and
having used some of the lini
ment makes the user liable for
pavment.
The farmers will pay the dol
lars rather than lose time and
money fighting the claims, but
it is a safe prediction that the
next patent medicine agent who
visits them will get a warm re
ception—Johnstown Leader.

[ln an endeavor to overcome the difficulty caused by the shortage of men for farm work the Brftish government has decided,
says the London Daily News, to inaugurate a campaign to recruit women for this work. It is proposed that an armlet
be issued to women willing to undertake farm work and that they also be entitled to wear a special uniform. Every
village in the country will be canvassed by committees of women, and it is hoped by the canvass to raise a body of 400,-
000 women who are ready to engagé in agricultural work. Our photo shows women feeding a threshing machine on an

gers, special agent of the United

the line. Omcials here assumed

ceed to use the railroad on a
commercial basis, which is con

CLEVELAND, 0., March 30.
—With a toll of at least thirty
persons dead, for forty or moro
injured, federai and state offi
ciate of the railroad company be
gan today an investigation into
the cause that led early Jiis
morning to one of the most di»*»
astrous wrecks that has occur-t
red in this state in a dozen yeara
and one of the worst in the his
tory of the New York Central
system.
Three trains, including the
Twentieth Century Limited,

trali palatial Hyer, and two seo
tions of No. 86, known as the
Chicago-Pittsburgh Limited,

collision near Amherst, 0., thir
ty-seven miles west of Cleveland.
Reports generally credited
were that the first and second
sections of No. 86 were proceed
ing at a rapid rate and some
points were only a mile or so
apart. When the second section
crashed into the first section, the
Twentieth Century plowed into
the wreckage of the first two
trains which buJ.ged over from
the parallel tracks and the three
were thrown into an indescrib
able mass.
