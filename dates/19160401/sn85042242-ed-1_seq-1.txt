Fargo, MarjU '!1.—The first day
of the Non-Parti&iu League state
convention has closed and a ticket
lias been placed in the Hold jr. the
various oiQccs. Soai-i of tlie eandi
dales will run by bticker, some in
republicans and ethe.'.i :ar, democrats.
For OnVR'nor.
Yynn J. Frasser, graduate of Grand
Forks university, and who lives -n
farm noar Hoopl?, was chosen a*
llit1 standard bearer of the leaguers
for the office of governor. 1 fe was

Senatorial Situat'en.
At present writing, no effort had
been made to oiidoi'.-to or nomiuate
a man to rur. Or :tie United States
senate. There seems to be a general
belief that this matter will not be
taken up at this mseing.
Attendance Fair.
There are between 1,000 and 1.100
•people attending the meetings, out
many are local. The exact number
•of outsiders inu'»t be exactly givm
out unless a repj made ay tne cre­
dentials committee is turned over to
the press.
Dissatisfaction Shnjvn.
Dissatisfaction with the Farmers'
Non-Partisan League method of do­
ing business, its nomination of can­
didates for state offices and its at­
tempt to cram that ticket down the
throats of its members prevails
among the league members.
Leaders Hold Down Matters.
That such dissatisfaction will burst
forth, not at this convention, but in
the form of general opposition to
the league movement throughout the
state on the part of the men who
have heretofore been more or less
favorable to the organization, is the
general sentiment in evidence now.
Skillful Manipulation.
There were no league sessions to­
night, adjournment beeing taken till
tomorrow morning. Throughout the
morning and afternoon, skillful hand­
ling of the platform program, elim­
inated any possible dissension and
thefe is little likelihood that the
league members who have become
thoroughly disgusted with the organ­
ization, will attempt anything here.
They are unwilling to subject, them­
selves to any condition that might
be created through open objection
here. The nomination of a ticket
by "hand picked" delegates is now
generally accepted on every hand as
bearing out assertions .long made
that the league's ticket would be
selected by the big five. The regu­
larly electcdm delegates to the state
convention arrived to find everything
had already been done. Stenmo, of
iMerrifleld announced as a candidate
for lieutenant, governor, declared em­
phatically that he would not make

Hush Money
Was Buried
Under Tree
New York, March 31.—Buried under
a tree at the extreme Up of Long .Is­
land, a detective today found a roll of
bills which Eugene Oliver Kane, the
embalmer, asserted was forced upon
him by Dr. Arthur Warren Waite, in
an effort to induce him to swear there
was arsenic in the embalming fluid
used on the body of Dr. Waite's fath­
er-in-law John E. Pack, for whose
murder the young man was indicted
today.
The roll the detective told District
Attorney Swann totaled only $7,800
when found by the detective. Kane
said he did npt count tne ljioney and
did not' know whether Waite's count
was accurate.
District Attorney Swann said to­
night that Waite, who is a prisoner
at Bellevue hospital, where he is re­
covering from the effects of drugs
taken just, before his arrest, probably
will be arraigned tomorrow on the
indictment which charges him with
murder in the first degree.

4pMITS HI3 DEALS
WERE RATHER 'TRICKY"
Minot, March SI.—Grant Youmans
who is suing state officials and Minot
bankers for $355,000 damages for al­
leged conspiracy in closing a bank
owned by him, admitted on the stand
today that when his institution was
closed there was $25,000 in worthless
paper.
Under the gruelling cross examina­
tion of Francis J. Murphy, assistant
attorney general, he was vsably shak­
en, shifting in his seat and evading
questions until soundly rebuked from
the bench to answer properly.
Most of the poor paper executed in
three days was signed by men practi­
cally unknown in that' section of the
.state and admitted by Youmans as
being strangers to him.
He admitted further that he deeded
lands to various men, mostly trans­
ients and took heavy mortgages back
as a consideration for the transaction
and then took a deed back to himself
without a dollar of real money chang­
ing hands. He also took affidavits
from these men saying that the tran­
saction was in good faith.
Witness even characterized these
transactions as trickey and that he
had made them in order to trick some
one.
It was admitted on all sides here
this evening that Youmans has weak­
ened his case and has failed to make
even as good a showing as before the
legislative investigating committee.
March, which came in like a lion,
went out meekly as a lamb. The air
was fine and balmy and the sky clear,
on every side the echoes of the
roar could be traced by the deep
drifts of snow and the mud puddles
in the middle yf the streets.

Wqttest March in History.
That March, 1010, was the •wettest
ever recorded for this section of the
state is borne out by the following fig­
ures contained in a statement: issued
from the weather observatory by
Orris W. Roberts, observer:
The weather at Bismarck during
March was characterized by sudden
changes in temperature and by exces­
sive precipitation. The temperature
for the month, however, averaged
slightly above the normal. The high­
est temperature was 59 degrees on
the 11th the lowest was -23 on the
2d. The sunshine was nearly normal.
The total precipitation, 3.35 inches,
was the highest of record for March
since the station was established in
1S74. The nearest approach to this

Washington, March 31.—With Vil­
la's main command shattered by Col.
Dodd'.s cavalry, the war department
expects that the death or the capture
of the bandit leader himself, and the
successful conclusion of the American
punitive expedition to rid northern
Mexico of the raiders will follow
more rapidly than had first been inti­
mated.
Congress Cheers Dash.
Congress stopped business and
cheered the dash of the American
troopers. President Wilson sent word
of congratulation 10 Secretary Baker,
and the secretary sent messages of
congratulations to Major General
Funston to be conveyed to Brigadier
General Pershing and Col. Dodd. The
first smashing blow at the bandits
was what officials had expected of
Pershing's seasoned troopers, but
few of them had hoped it would come
so soon.
General Pershing's dispatch with
the news of the fight reached the war
department late this afternoon. It re­
ported the results in terse sentences,
giving few details.
Desperately Wounded.
Desperately wounded, and perma­
nently crippled with a broken leg and
lame hip, Villa was reported to have
left his men before the fight to hide in
the nearby mountains. His force,
broken into small bands, was report­
ed attempting reformation in the
Santa Maria valley, pressed 011 all
sides by American and Carranza col­

General Funs-

President Sends Congratulations.
"Secretary of war desires you to
convey to General Pershing and Col.
Dodd and command his hearty con­
gratulations on exploit."
On behalf of the president, the
president, the White House authoriz­
ed a similar expression.
Belief as expressed tonight in all
quarters that the successful end of
the American expedition was in sight.
Officials believe that Dodd victory,
if followed promptly by the capture or
death of Villa himself, would go far
toward restoration of peace in Mexico.
In his telegram to General Funston,
forwarded here by the latter from
Fort Sam Houston, General Pershing
indicated probable results of the
American victory.
"With Villa permanently disabled,
Lopez wounded, and Hernandos dead,
the blow administered is a serious
one to Villa's band," he said.
Praise Col. Dodd.
Unstinted praise was given in all
quarters to Col. Dodd. He is 64 years
of age, and has been in the saddle
practically ever since the troops were
ordered to the border. He will retire
on account of age next July. Ap­
pointed 1o the military academy from
Pennsylvania, in 1876, he distinguish­
ed himself during the Spanish-Ameri­
can war, participating in the battle of
San Juan, and in many fights in the
Philippines.
RUSH WORK ON ROAD.
Seward, Alaska, March SI.—Track

force of more than 1,000 men. Trains
are running from Anchorage as far
as Eklutna, and will be operated as
soon as the bridge over the Knick
river is completed, which will be
within the next three weeks.
Reports from the inlet indicated
that navigation to Anchorage may be
resumed by the middle of April.

Bandit Chief Carried to Hid­

Carriage
THIRTY MEXICAN DEAD
WERE LEFT ON FIELD
Leaders Prestige Over Peons If
Said to Have Been
Shattered
El Paso, .March 31.—Four hundred
American cavalrymen under the com.-,
niand of Col. George A. 'Dodd, whirl­
ing down from the granite slopes of
the great Continental diivide, have
fallen like a thunderbolt on the main
body of Francisco Villa's bandits at
the Santa Geronimo ranch, scatter
ing them like chaff in the driving
winds and wounding the bandit
chief. He was left crippled to seek
a hiding place in the mountains over
which he has roamed.
Hurried in Carriage.
Villa was hurried from danger in a
carriage. The battle opened at 6
o'clock in the morning of March 29.
For seventeen hours, the veteran
Col. Dodd and his picked riders of
valley of the ftanta Maria river. At
the end of a fifty-five mile ride,
they burst upon the unsuspecting
Villa camp, where 500 Mexican ban­
dits were celebrating the massacre
of 172 G'arranzaistas, two days pre­
viously at Guerro. Villa was shot
through the leg and with one hip
shattered, was hurried from the
scene barely in time to escape the
onslaught of the American soldiers.
Helpless Stand.
The bandits made a brief, but
helpless, stand before the troopers of
Col. Dodd. Then they broke and
fled, leaving 31 dead on the field, in*
eluding their commander, General
Eliso Herandez. Two machine guns,
a number of horses, rifles, ammuni­
tion and equipment, fell into thq
hands of the victors.
Lopez Wounded.
Among the known wounded, is
Pablo Lopez, Villa's lieutenant in the
Columbus raid. The American cas­
ualties were four privates wounded.
Villa's career has ended, his power
has been broken. His death or cap­
ture is only a question of days, per­
haps only hours.
Such is the inevitable conclusion
here, as little by little, comes news
of Dodd's ride across the border.
Scene of Victor/.
The scene of Col. Dodd's victory
is a broad valley, lying at the head
of the Santa Maria. On the west,
rise the barren foothills of the Con­
tinental divide, and to the east is a
trail made famous by Villa, which
leads through the Laguna de Castille
district, to the ill-famed Santa Ysa
bel. It was at the latter place that
Villa killed 18 American mining men,
a crime which sent a thrill of horror
throughout the United States and
marked the beginning of what may
be the end of his blood stained ca­
reer. It was toward Santa Ysable
that he was believed to be heading
when the troops swept down from
the north on his camp.
Took Villa by Siirprise,
From the meagre details which
have reached here from Mexican and
American military sources, Col. Dodd
and his men made their way unno­
ticed through the arroyes, or deep
gulches, which split the foothills in
all directions, and were almost in the
camp before the alarm was given.
is reported to have .been In
a small tent nursing his injuries
when the crash of the A#terjteail vol­
leys awakened the Mexictnfe to panic
stricken action.
The extraordinary hold the bandit
chief has over his followers is shown
by the fact that their first thought
was to save him.
Carried to Secrat Place.
Unable to walk or ride, he ~*a*
hurriedly placed in a light wagon
and driven over the rough
trails to some secret place.
The one great factor that is re
lied upon to bring about bii end, is
the practical certainty that his prest­
ige is shattered. The ignorance of
the peons who clung to Villa as their
leader and hero is said to have been
his strongest card. It, is certabi that
the majority of them were satisfied
that their hero bad won A
