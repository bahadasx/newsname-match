SAN ANTONIO, Texas, .March 31. Thirty, of Villa's
sold ids killed, four American soldiers wounded and more
than 430 Mexicans dispersed after a running fight that
extended over ten miles is the condensed summary of the
story of the first engagement between forces of the Amer
ican punitive expedition and Francisco Villa. Colonel
George Dodd surprised five hundred of Villa's men at
Guerrero, March 29. His was the smaller force, compris
ing detachments of the Seventh and Tenth cavalry, but
without waiting he began the attack that finished five
hours later when the Villa l'orce had been chased into the
hills northeast of Guerrero and broken into small bands.
General Pershing's report reached General Funston
today and by him was transmitted immediately to the
war department. It was filed at San (Jcroninio, but
whether General Pershing was still there today was re
garded as unlikely by army officers here, and less likely
that Colonel Dodd was yet at Guerrero.
Villa is Injured.
Villa was not with the defeated force and Colonel
I)o(Ulyvs believed to be forcing his cavalry to its utmost
exertion to run him down before an opportunity, was
found for him to reconcentrate his scattered men. It was
reported to army headquarters here that Villa was
wounded; that one of his legs was broken and one of his
hips badly bruised. The character of his reported in jur
ies suggested that perhaps he had been injured in falling
from his horse rather than by a gunshot, as had been un
officially reported.
Surprised the Bandits.
Colonel Dodd attacked the Mexicans at ( o'clock, ac
cording to General Pershing's report, but whether in the
forenoon or in the afternoon was not stated. Here it was
regarded as probable that it. was in the morning for the
action which followed continued five hours and included
a cross-country chase that could not well have been made
after dark.
The four United States troopers injured were en
listed meu.
Jt was known at General Funston's headquarters
that Villa and a considerable force of his men were in that
part of the country. Jteports.that he attacked the small
garrison at Guerrero and had killed more than 170 of Car
rana 's soldiers had been confirmed, and it also was re
liably reported that he had occupied Minaca, a short dis
tance south of Guerrero. General Cavazos, commander
"of the Carranza forces operating in that district, had re
ported to his government a skirmish with Villa's men at
. Guerrero.
Hide in the Mountains.
Scouts had brought to General Pershing information
that made him believe that the concentration Villa had
" under way had resulted in the gathering of several hun
dred men and the hope that he was prepared to make a
staud was high When the news of Colonel Dodd's attack
was received.
Details of the action were not sent by General Per
shiug, but the I'act that it was continued for five hours
indicated a stiff resistance, although a great part of t'nat
time was employed in the chase of the flethig Mexican;
into the hills.
North and east of Guerrero there is a cluster of
mountains that the Mexicans appear to have been trying

WILSON IS ELATED
Messages Congratulating
Dodd and Pershing Sent
by. Secretary.
WASHINGTON, March 31. With
Villa's main command shat
tered by Colonel Dodd's ravulry dash,
the war department expects that the
death or capture of the bandit leader
himself and the successful conclusion
of the American punitive expedition
to rid northern Mexico of his raiders
will follow more quickly than It had
at first been anticipated.
The five-hour running fight in
which Dodd's outnumbered troopers
killed Villa's chief lieutenant and
many of his men with only four of
their own number slightly wounded,
occurred forty-eight hours before the
news reached Washington. Army of
ficers are sure that since the fight
heavier forces have come up to sup
port the flying columns and another
actlen may have followed of which
nothing was known here tonight.
Kveiywbere jatlsfaction over the
exploit of Colonel Dodd nnd his men
was expressed. Secretary Maker's
congratulations were sent In this mes
sage from Major-General Scott, chief
of staff to MaJ'ir-General Funston on
the border:
Congratulates Conininiiilcrs.
"Secretary of war desires you to
convey to General Pershing and
Colonel Dodd and command Ills
heurty congratulations on exploit."
On behalf of tho president, the
While House authorized a siinilur eA
pression.
In congress the news caused a dein.
onst ration of cheers and applause In
the house when Speaker Clark inter
rupted proceedings for the reading of
General Pershing's dispatch. Debate
on the army Increase hill was halted
for the reading of the telegram In
the senate, sent to the vice president's
desk by Senator Warren of Wyoming,
General Pershing's father-in-law.
Delay in receipt of General Per
shing's report was ascribed by war
department heads to the great dis
tance from the border Hnd difficulties
of communication. The scene of the
fight was about 22 5 miles south of
Juhioz.

"Certainly," wo retorted, dcflintly.
"Why?"
"Thrn I was right. I tcld my
mother that some of your Jokes are

So far as can be learned there is
absolutely no warrant of law for this
method of registration and the indica
tions are that what promised to be a
quiet and orderly election will turn
out to be one of tho most turbulent
and strenuous the city has ever wil.
nessed. The Idea of securing regis
trations by mail was never before
heard of or even dreamed of and
there is no way of determining tho
extent to which a scheme of this char
acter could be worked. The discov.
cry came like a clap of thunder from
a clear sky and aroused the greatest
Indignation among the Democrats as
well as Kcpulilicuiis who are standing
for a fuir and honest election. It
strikes down every vestige of honrsty
in elections and If successful would
absolutely control the result and the
votes of holiest citizens would be off
set by the wholesale. Any man who
ever lived in Tulsa could mail in onn
ot these cards and claim tho right to
vote on election day without the for
mality of a i en ti In i' registration, .ro

Aside from this discovery the day
was uneventful in the registration
