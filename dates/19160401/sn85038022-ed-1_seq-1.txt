VILLA WOUNDED
BY CAVALRYMEN
Amerlrniis I'mlw Col. llodd Scatter
Villa's Hand and Almost Cnplure
llnndlt Villa's Career Kndcd
HI Paso, Texas, April 1. Four hun
dred American cavalrymen, under the
command of Colonel Ocorgo A. Dodd,
galloping down from tho granite
slopes of tho great continental divide,
havo fallen In with tho main body of
t.-V.,.,l.. V'lllo'a I. n nt Mm Sfllb
Qeronlmo ranch, scattering Iticnt In
many directions and driving the ban
dlt chief wounded nnd crippled to
seek a hiding placo In tho moun
tains. Villa wns hurried from danger
In a carriage. The fight opened nt 6
o'clock In tho morning of March 29,
and continued for several hours. -
Tho news of tho oxplolt was Hashed
Into Junrcz yesterday and sent a thrill
J along tho border. For seventeen hours
the veteran colonel witn nis pickcu
trooucrs of the Seventh and Tenth
Cavalry, drove down the valley of the
Santa Maria rlvor. At the end or n
flfty-flvo mllo ride they fell upon the
unsuspecting Villa camp, where COO
bandits were celebrating tho massacre
of 172 Carranza.soldlcr8 two days pre
vious at Guerrero.
Villa shot through the hip nnd with
ono limb shattered, was hurried from
the scene, barely In time to cscapo the
onslaught of tho Americans. The ban
dits made a brief but hopeless stand
before a charge of Colonel Dodd nnd
his troopers. Then they broke nnd
after leaving thlrty-thrco dead on the
field, Including their commander, Gen.
Ellsco Hcrnnndcz. Three machine
guns, n number of horses, rifles, am
munition and equipment fell Into the
hands of tho Americans.
Among the known wounded Is Pablo
Lopez, Villa's lieutenant in the Colum
bus raid. Tho American casualties
were four privates wounded.
The American soldiers did not lln
ger on the field of victory. For five
hours they drove the enemy before
them Into the wlndernoss of mountain
peak, desert and canyon, where roads
or even trails tiro unknown and whore
n misstep means death to horso and
rider. They halted only after the
chaEu had led them ten miles and the
fugitives were scattered Into little
bauds of half a dozen men each.
Villa's career hns ended: ills power
has been broken. His death or cap
turo is only a question of days, per
haps only hours. Such Is tho Inev
itablc conclusion reached hero ns
little by little tho details of "Dodd's
ride" reach the border. It seems lm
possible that tho crippled bandit can
remain hidden, even in tho mountain
ous wastes in which he hns sought
rofugc.
