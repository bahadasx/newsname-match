opened up and by the indications
and the rock which is exhibited
it looks as if they have struck
it right. People from Los An

ATTENTION "TEXICANS.'
Douglas, Ariz., March 27, 1910.
The Border Vidette, Nogales,
Arizona.
The former Texans of Arizona
will hold their annual San Jacin
to Day celebration at McNeal,
Arizona, April 22nd, Saturday.
Doubtless many of your readers
are "Texicans" and we desire,
through tne columns 01 your
paper, to extend to each of them
a cordial invitation to be present
and meet their old friends from
the Lone Star State and hear
once more their "mother tongue"
just as she is " spoke" on the
Trinity and the Brazos.
A prize will be given for the
best composition on "Texas"
written by a school child under
sixteen and the speakers will
include Gov. Hunt, Hon. Tom
W. Nealon,ot Phoenix, and Hon.
Dan M. Jackson, district judge
at El Paso. The former need
no introduction ia Arizona. The
latter, Judge Jackson, is one of
the most noted- speakers in
Texas, being famous throughout
the state for his brilliant ora
tory. His address at the State
Bar Association meeting at Dal
las, was the sensation of the
meeting.
There will be fancy roping
and riding and other s(orts and
a geneial good time for all. We
expect to have the First Cavalry
Concert Band, which played for a
year at the San Francisco Fair.
We are endeavoring to obtain
low railroad rates but can make
no definite announcement regard
ing this at the present time.
"Texicans" are expected to be
present or offer a legal excuse
for absence. All other nation
alities are invited as guests and
will be made welcome.
If some of your readers will
take the trouble to send me a
list of their friends who former
ly lived in Texas I shall .be glad
to send detailed information to
each one. My address is Doug

OUR MEXICAN POLICY.
There could be no better guar j
antee of the sincerity of Ame
rica's intentions in regard to
Mexico, than the action of con
gress in adoptin-g the La Follette
resolution. It is to Mexico, to
all Latin America and the world
in general an assurance of our
perfect good faith in the oft re
peated statement that we have
no desire to seize any portion of
Mexican territory.
After indorsing the president's
policy in sending a punitive ex
pedition in pursuit of Villa and
his gang of brigands, the reso
lution goes on to say that "con
gress extends its assurance to
the de facto government of Mex-.
ico and to the Mexican people
that the pursuit of said lawless
band of armed men across the
international boundary line into
Mexico is for the simple purpose
of arresting and punishing the
fugitive bands of outlaws; that
the congress in approving the
use of the armed forces of the
United States for the purposes
announced joins with the presi
dent in declaring that such mili
tary expedition shall not be per
mitted to encroach in any degree
upon the sovereignity of Mexico
or to interfere in any manner
with the domestic affairs of the
Mexican people."
It should be manifest to all
that a nation so great and so
powerful and one having stood
up so often for the principles of
international justice could not
possibly go back upon a promise
made with such explicitness.
We are not a military nation
using diplomatic tactics in order
to gain a strategic advantage
over an adversary, and for the
reason that in the military sense
we have no present enemy.
If congress did not mean every
word of that resolution it would
not have said anything bearing
on the matter. A strong nation
faced with the possibility of a
conflict with a smaller one does
not begin by making promises
the very opoosite of its inten
tions. Ouite apart from flagrant
dishonesty, such a course would
be both unnecessary ,and absurd.
But, assuming that there can
be -'no:- question of America's
friendliness for Mexico, it was a
wisely conceived move to pass
the La Follette resolution, be
cause in that way the president's
policy becomes openly indorsed
as that of all our representatives
and of the people themselves.
Latin America will see in that
declaration a manifest desire on
the part of the United States to
preserve the integrity of the
territory of all the republics of
the western hemisphere.
The patience shown by the
United States in regard to the
border raids may be taken as a
further evidence of our sincerity
in making at this stage a bold
proclamation of our friendship
for Mexico. San Francisco
Chronicle.
SOME COPPER.
A shipment of 4,464,800 pounds
of copper in 49 cars, left Globe
Wednesday afternoon over the
Arizona Eastern Railroad, pass
ing through Safford Wenesday
night, the destination being Perth
Amboy, New Jersey, where are
located some of the largest metal
refiners of the world.
This trainload of copper is the
largest single shipment of the
red metal ever made from Ariz
ona, and reduced to fine copper,
its value, at 27 cents per pound,
is approximately 1,105,000.00.
Maintained at the above rate of
protection, the output of the In
ternational and Old Dominion
smelters for one year would be
231,169,600 pounds, and would
far exceed the production of
copper from any other district
in Arizona. Graham Guardian.
Figures compiled by the Dis
trict Forester at Albuquerque
show a total production of lum
ber in Arizona in 1915 of 75,000,-
000 board feet. Similar figures
for New Mexico show a total of
06,000,000 feet. In addition,
some 25,000,000 feet of lath and
shingles were produced in the
two states last year. 55 mills
were reported as in operation.
WHAT IT WOULD MEAN.
The following article from the
Arizona Record gives a good
idea of what peace, without pre
paredness, would mean to our
country :
"Can nothing save us from
this impending burden of pre
paredness?" asks a pacifist con
gressman. "Can't we have peace with
our neighbors without toting a
a big pistol?" Beyond all man
ner of doubt, yes, it wUl meet a
number of conditions which the
American people seem strongly
disinclined to meet. Give up the
Monroe doctrine; say to Ger
many, Great Britain, France,
Italy, Japan and all other pow
ers, big, little, and intermediate,
that we wash our hands forever
of the protection we have main
tained for ninety years over the
young republics to the south.
Dismantle the fortifications at
the Panama canal and let the
powerful nation that -wants it
take it.
Get out of the Philippines
and Hawaii.
Yield to the wishes of Japan
with respect to Japanese immi
gration. Japanese ownership of
land and admission of Japanese
to our public schools.
Abandon the historic Amer
ican doctrine that American
lives and American interests will
be protected abroad in their just
rights.
Give up the John Hay doctrine
of the open door in China.
Let other countries, with their
rival interests do what they
please with American commerce.
Proclaim to the world, in short,
that we are "too proud to fight,"
too steeped in commercialism to
contend for justice and honor,
too wedded to slothful peace to
resent insult or wrong. In sort,
that henceforth and forever we
are to be devoted to the Chinese
philosophy of life and the Chin
ese brand of patriotism and love
of country. It is all as simple
and easy as that.
GREATERVILLE PLACERS.
A. W. Larrson, who recently
leased 150 acres of placer
ground from Col. R. R. Richard
son, in the Greaterville district,
about 23 from Patagonia, was
down Saturday, and well pleased
with the outlook so far. Mr. Larr
son has a late improved dredger,
so constructed as to require very
little water and by means of a re
servoir attachment, is able to
use the same water over and
over again, liy means of this
machine he expects to work
ground that has been too ex
pensive to work by other me
thods. Mr. Larrson brought to town
with him the first button of gold
taken from his ground, which
he sent to his wife as a present.
The button was worth about $25
or 30 and a remarkably pretty
specimen, of very fine quality
gold. When he gets the well
down which he is now digging,
and his machine started in earn
est, he expects to be able to take
out many such valuable buttons.

MINERAL HILL.
A' new shaft is being sunk at
the Mineral Hill mine, south of
the Twin Buttes district, and
promising ore has beeu located
from the surface to the 6r foot
level, according to Judge Charlus
Blenman of Tucson, who made a
trip to the mine Sunday in com
pany with Theodore Ahrans, an
eastern capitalist.
The main shift is supplying
most of the ore, averaging 100
tons per day, but it is expected
that ore from the new shaft will
greatly increase the output. Ore
in the main shaft is produced on
the 330-foot level, and the pro
duct here is first class, Mr. Blen
man states. About 85 men are
employed at present.
Mining men in this district
and in the Paymaster section
are hoping that work on the
railroad will be started in the
near future. This railroad would
tap a rich ore district and add
to the total production at Miner
al Hill, San Xavter and the Pay
master properties. The railroad
survey is being made.
