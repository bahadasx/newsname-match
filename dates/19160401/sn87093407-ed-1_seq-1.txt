BOMBS KILL 28
LONDON, April 1. —One of five Zeppe
lins which raided the east coast of England
last night, the L-15, was shot down by anti
air craft guns and fell into the water off
Thames Estuary, it was learned today.
Twenty-eight were killed and 40 injured
by Zeppelins in their raid, the admiralty an
nounced.
Two Zeppelin squadrons raided the
eastern counties while a lone Zeppelin
visited the northeast region. A total of 74
bombs were dropped.
The airship brought down in Thames
Estuary was one of the latest models.
The raider was wrecked 35 miles east of
London.
Patrol boats immediately surrounded the
floating Zeppelin. Its crew surrendered.
Just as the last German was taken off,
the great airship broke up and sank.

A single bomb killed an entire
family of three persons and wound

reported.
