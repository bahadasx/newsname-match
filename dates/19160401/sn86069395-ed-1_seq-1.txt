BALD-HEADED
CLUB MEETS
Reorganization of The Old
Time Club at Virginia
Park.
CHAMPLIN'S MODESTY
Voluntarily Lays Down The
Scepter and Will Surren
der The Presidency.
Promptly as the clock in the town
above the Fire department tolled the
solemn hour of midnight, the "Old
Guard" of the ancient order of twenty
years ago known as "The Baldheaded
Club" were seen emerging from
many houses and wending their way
towards the assembly roojn in the
pavilion at Virginia Park, which had
been designated as the place for the
meeting for reorganization. Quietly
the word had been passed along that
the old organization was to be revived
and placed upon a permanent and
enduring basis.
Ten long years had rolled around
since Col. Green H. Champlin,
angered by the audacity of Col. Bob
Wooldridge in daring to announce
himself a candidate for President, had
rapped upon the marble stand and
declared 1 adjourn, disband, pro
rogue and disperse this club forever,
or until such bine as it can meet
without my being annoyed by such
contests as this. I am President of
this club and in the words of Wade
Hampton, 'By the Eternal Gods, I'll
be President' as long as I live or un
til I get tired of the job."
Not since then had a meeting been
held. Ten new calendars one by one
have been hung upon the wall. The
seasons have come and gone. Ten
times the fruitful soil of God's Coun
try has yielded its bountiful crops.
Night riders have had their day, base
ball has flourished and passed away.
Hopkinsville has grown and pros
pered, floods have risen and subsided,
a new generation of children have
filled the grammar grades in the
public schools. Strange things have
happened. Banquet speakers have
even found a new joke or two as the
wheels of time have revolved. Even
the landmarks have disappeared and
the beautiful Park toward which all
wended their way marks the site of
one of them. One by t,:..;. the "Old
Guard" entered and too.. ;!ieir seats.
As they removed their hatj a glance
was enough to show that every man
had been true to his utth. Not an
additional hair marred tho polished
dome of any member there. With a
contempt for hair restorers, dandruff
cures, wigs and tupees, every moth
er's son of them had stood by his
colors and was even balder than of
yore.
Col. Champlin called tho meeting
to order, but there was meekness In
his manner. Ten years had softened
tho words he onco had uttered.
Time had dulled the sharpness of his
tongue. Taking from the lapel of his
coat an American Beauty rose, whoso
eleven mates had been sent south on
the 5:30 train, he used its glowing
petals for tho hammer ho onco
wielded as a gavel, and softly tapped
for order.
"In tho beginning, Colonels, let inb
say," were his opening words, "that
I shall occupy tills office temporarily,
or at your pleasure. Thero must be
no strife in this revivified order. It
Is bad enough to liave members of tho
Legislature fussing and fighting at
Frankfort. Wo must start out by
enscribing upon our banner the mot
to 'Peace at any Price.' If Bob
Wooldridgo wants to run for Presi
dent, if Joo Twyman ylolds to the call
of ambition, if even Lem McKco

But-Is Beaten Off In the Nick
of Time to
Him.
Save
San Antonio, March 31. After kill
ing every one of the 172 men in the
garrison at Guerrero, Francisco Villa
moved northward Wednesday and is
now somewhere near the headwaters
of the Santa Maria river, according to
unofficial information secured by Gen.
Funston last night.'
At the head of a considerable force,
Villa was reported to be on the San
Geronimo ranch or the Quemada
ranch and troops of both the United
States and Mexico were believed to
be closing in on him.
It has been learned that Villa nearly
lost his life a few days ago on the
Corralitos ranch, a short distance from
Dublan, where he tortured and put to
death five Mexicans. One of his vic
tims leaped upon him and was strang
ling Villa when officers boat his
assailant senseloss with the butts of
their guns.
Mucio Polanco was the name of the
Mexican who almost succeeded in
ending Villa's career.
The murder of five membors of the
Polanco family was said to have been
intended as a warning to other Mexi
cans against having dealings with
Americans. Invcstitration showed that
the Polanco family was involved with
nd political faction in Mexico but they
had a record of honesty and reliability
in dealing with the American mana
gers of the Corralitos ranch, where
they were born and reared.
COULD NOT FIND DAUGHTERS.
When Villa, retreating from Colum
bus, arrived at the ranch, he had a
list of all the Polancos, six men. the
mother and two daughters. He seized
the men and hunted for the daugh
ters, but the young women had been
hidden so well that he never found
them.
To five of the men, Grecorio and
his two sons, and Mucio and his one
son, villa said: "lam going to kill
you because you are too American
ized. You are "rintro lovers."
But instead of killing them outrieht.
Villa had them partly stripped and
then beaten with the flats of heavy
swords. Mucio Polanco broke awav
from his captors and got one hand
locked about Villa's throat before he
was beaten off. Next Villa ordered
the five stood up beneath a huge arch
way, where he told them he would
hang them. Ropes were placed about
their necks and they were jerked into
the air. but not nnrmiltpr! fn fliV .IiiQf
when loss of consciousness approach

with demands that thev reveal the

horses, so far as investigation lias dis
closed. Tho prisoners also were of

where money was hidden or point
