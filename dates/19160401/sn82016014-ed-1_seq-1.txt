Washinerton. April 1. In the belief

hard pressed Villa outlaws, and that
possibly Francisco Villa himself re

government officials today anxiously

shattering Villa's main column.

DONS WAR TOGS?
Holland Deeply Incensed Over
Sinking Dutch Ships.
Cancel Military Vacations; Spe
cial Call for Parliament.
London. April 1.- Private dis
patches received in Copenhagen from
Rotterdam and wireless messages
from German sources say that consid
erable uneasiness prevails in Holland
and that the Dutch military and na
val authorities are taking various pre
cautions. All leaves for naval and
military officers have been cancelled.
Railway cars which were placed at
the disposal of the military authori
ties on the outbreak of the war and
subsequently were released temporar
ily hive been requisitioned. There
have been significant meetings of
those in high command in the army
and navy. One report says both
nouses 01 parliament nave oeen sum-
monea.
The dispatches do not disclose the
cause of the feeling or insecurity but
it presumably is connected with the
sinking of Dutch steamships and con
sequent interference with trade be
tween Holland and her colonies.

tween England and Holland is still in

With F'resident Wilson out of town

London, April 1. German artillery
has opened the bombardment of the
Verdun-Paris railway from Avocourt
woods, 6 miles to the north, Paris dis
patches reported today.
The bombardment is believed to 'oe
a prelude to a German drive south
ward toward the railway and a gen
eral assault on French positions north
west of Verdun.
The cannonade is being accom
panied by hourly air battles. Convoyed
by armored aeroplanes. German ma
chines are speeding along the rail
way, signaling the range to the crown
prince's batteries. French airmen
drive off the German fliers as each
fresh squadron appears.
Important Victory.
The German victory at Malancourt,
it was emphasized here, renews the
menace to all the French fortified po
sitions on the west bank of the Meuse.
The Germans are expected to follow
up their advantage by a massed at
tack on Bethincourt, and another
drive in the Avocourt region as soon
as the artillery can be brought up.
Malancourt, though only a small
group of houses, was an important
feature of the French defense north
west of Verdun since it dominated
important highways. The French
only relinquished possession under a
terrific assault when three-fourths
surrounded.
Make Fierce Night Assault.
Paris. April 1. German forces de

in the Verdun region east of the
Meuse. The war office announced this

Germans a footing in the village of
Vaux. The other attack was repulsed.
West of the river there was a violent
bombardment in 'he region of Malan

TO ADVERTISERS:
Some newspapers in the larger cities
are suggesting to their big advertisers
that they reduce the size of their ad
vertisements. The State Journal suggests this to
its Topeka advertisers. Where the
advertiser has been in the habit of
using seven columns, he might reduce j
his space to five or six columns; cut
a five column space to three or four j
columns, and a four column space to
three columns; four half columns ,
might be put into three halve?; and
where a double ten is planned, the 1
space might be reduced to a double j
nine: or a single ten to eight inches.
The Chicago News is now not only
suggesting to its large advertisers that
they cut down their space, but is per-
emptorily saying to them that they ,
cannot permit them to use more than
i a certain limited number of inches on ;
i certain days.
Other daily newspapers are catering
I to the small advertisers, those who
run a two inch space, or three or four i
or f,ve. inches, on the theory that it is i
of more value to carry a large number !
of small display ads than a few big
ones. Among the papers pursuing ;
this method are the Springfield, Mass.,
Republican and the Bloomington. llli- j
nois, Pantagraph. Both these papers
belong to the high grade in the daily '
newspaper field.

this, of course, will be on Saturday
twentv oages equivalent to twenty
three pages of the old size. On Sat
urday, it is intended to print the usual
double number with colors, although
colored inks are on a stiff upgrade.
The fourteen page paper, eight col
umns to the paRe. is really the ideal

size. This was the size of the State
Journal yesterday. Advertising ami
reading matter were well balanced;

local merchants, could hardly have

The advertisements were indeed most !
attractive and the merchants are reap- :
ing a business harvest today, follow- j
ing their splendid announcements of)
attractive values in ihese columns last ;
evening.
To be sure, yesterday, even with the
fourteen big pages, the State Journal
was obliged to leave out about three
columns of reading matter: in fact, for
the last week, there has been an aver
age of three columns of reading mat
ter in type that was crowded out. Of
course. the important news was
printed.
At this time it is pertinent to refer
to the new noon edition, established
over a year ago. The sales of this
edition now exceed the sales of all j
the other three editions put out by the
State Journal.
The popularity of the paper is some
what difficult to understand, several
elements entering into it. There is
nearly always some good news that
has developed during the morning, or
too late at night for the morning pa
pers; then, too, the edition is available
at the mid-day rest and luncheon hour
when the business man has more time
to read, during his noonday respite
from work, than he had at the break- ;
fast table.
Another point, of course, in its fa- i
vor is the price, one cent. People do
not miss the penny. Then, too, ths
comic page is a factor.
The paper is popular, too, on all th- ,

It is to be hoped that the State Jour
nal will not be compelled to advance
the priee of its noon edition from one
cent to two cents, except for the dou
ble number in colors on Saturday, r
to
five cents, as was announced this !
week by a Houston paper.

British Vice Consul Ford, who went
to Lewes yesterday but who arrived
after Schiller had been taken away,
stated that he was at a loss to explain
the action of the detectives and local
authorities who agreed to let the man
go. Mr. Ford said he believed Schil
ler will have to be returned to Dela
ware for trial.
Schiller talked freely on the train
to New York and was anxious to learn
whether the four accomplices who he
i-aid had agreed to issist him in what
he termed a privateering expedition
had gotten on board another steamer.
He had arranged with these men, h
raid, to capture the steamer Kl Sparto,
which he belie ved was to sa il from
New York for Mediterranean ports
with passengers and several thousand
pounds in Knglish money.
It was his intention, he said, after
see jring the booty to turn the ship
into a commerce raider and thereby
ain revenge aganst Kngland for his
expulsion
the -same
from thai count ry and at
time do something fur thm
'fatherland."
