28 Killed by
Zeppelins in
English Raid
London. April 1. TVenfy-eight
persons were killed and 44 injured
in last night's air raid, according
to official fiirnres given out today.
It was officially announced this
afternoon that the Zeppelin dirigi.
ble balioon which fell Into the sea
was the 1.15. ..
London, April 1, (11 a. m.) It Is of
ficially announced that one of the Zep
pelins that raided the eastern coun
ties last night came down off the
mouth of the Thames and was cap
tured by a British patrol boat. The
official statement says:
"During the night a damaged Zep
pelin was observed to come down off
the Thames estuary. On being ap
proached by one of cur patrol vessels,
she surrendered. The crew was taken
off her and she was taken In tow but
she subsequently broke up and sank."
The raid of last night was the 22nd
of the war. The lost Zeppelin was the
third of her class to come to grief in
these raids.
Details of the attack have not been
published as yet by the authorities.
From unofficial sources it is learned
that many of the bombs were dropped
either into the sea or in places where
no damage was done.
It was an ideal night for the raid.
Everything was in favor of the Zep
pelins, including the atmospheric pres
sure and the lightness of the wind. The
dirigibles came in over the coast early
in the evening and sailing high, divided
their forces. Those who saw them say
they were larger than the dirgibles
used on previous visits. They kept at
such a height that they were out of
range of anti-aircraft gTThs as they
passed inland.
During the evening Zeppelins were
reported at various points. It was not
until after midnight that announce
ment was made of their departure.
Until the official report was issued this
morning it was not known that one
Zeppelin-had come down and up to
that time the public believed they had
escaped as Zeppelins had done so often
before.
An eye witness of a Zeppelin in
flight and it3 encounter with anti-air-
craft, puns describpq the rpptip an a
' a foo,ine ntmost thrilling one. The Zeppelin,
whicl
hich appeared to be of a larger type;tion as received here says in part:
jthan that of previous visitors, flew atj
ia considerable height. The glitter of !
its surface as it passed overhead at-
traded the attention of hundreds of;
people.
The searchlights which played on
the raider illuminated! it effectively
and shells from the guns that opened
fire could be seen burst ing all around
it. One gunner claime 1 that he had
secured a hit, the Zepp elin thereupon
being seen to turn abot it and proceed
towards the coast apparently
aged.
Disptches received from points on
the southeast, the eapt and the north
east coasts and in Jthe eastern coun
ties indicate that latt night's Zeppelin
raid or raids forXhere were several
separate ventures north and south
were the mostxtetsive yet under
take.
THE? WAR TODAY
With the village of Malancourt
in their possession, the (iermans
haTe tjnrned their attention to the
region of Le Mort Homme on the
west front. By a vigorons at
tack (in the French line between
Hill 2ij5 and le Mort Homme, the
Germans succeeded In entering
the French first line trenches.
By a n

drove them out.
Thejheavy bombardment which

Washington, AWl 1. Ambassador
Gerard cabled the jstate department to
day that he had en informed by the
German governmit that nothing was
known officially tljere of the attack on
the steamers Sussex and Englishman
but that an investigation was being
made. He said the German govern
ment informed him it had only received
newspaper report on the two cases
up to the present.
The contents of Ambassador Ger
ard's dispatch, the first received from
him since inquiries, about the two ships
i were iorwaraea to Benin several days
ago, was immediately sent by wireless
to President Wilson, who is taking a
week-end trip dowjn the Potomac river
on the naval yachi Mayflower.
The investigation promised may take
a week or more. Submarine com
manders at sea will have to report be
fore the German government will be
in a position to say definitely whether
one of its submarines attacked the
Sussex or Englishri.
Itcitbstag Adl SuK View.' '
Amsterdam, Hoind, March 30 (via
London, April l, 1 p. m.) A dispatch
received here from Berlin says that the
resolution regarding submarine war
rare which was adopted in the reich
stag is to be presented to Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg. The resolu-
"Seeing that the submarine has
proved to be an active weapon against
English methods of warfare, based on
the starvation of Germany the reich-
stag expresses the conviction that it
is necessary to make such use of our
military means as will guarantee the
peace and safeguard the future of
Germany."
The foregoing translation puts a dif
ferent aspect on the situation of the
dam-',reichstag than that implied in the
translation of the resolution sent by
wireless last night from the Overseas
News agency of Berlin. The wireless
version contained "these words:
"The reichstag expresses certitude
that it is necessary, to use all military
means, exclusive or submarines, in
such a way as to insure a peace which
guarantees Germany's future."

TO ARRAIGN WAITE
MONDAY MORNING
Then
-Al
i urn, April 1. ur. Arthur
Waite will be placed on trial
.rder of his wealthy father
john E. Peck, the district at-
expects, within a month. If
condition permits, Waite will be
arraigned next Monday morning on
the two indictments found against
him yesterday. The first count in the
indictment, which is for murder in
the first degree, charges Waite with
killing Peck by arsenic. The second
count charges the murder of Peck by
the administration of some poison un
known. Waite's attorney, after the arraign
ment, expects to petition the court to
recommit his client to Bellevue hos
pital, so that he may be examined
there by an alienist engaged by tha
defense. The attorney said that the
process of determining Waite's men
tal condition would require at least
six weeks. The prisoner, according
to reports, is not in agreement with
the plan of trying to prove him in
sane. "I'm just as sane as you are.
You can't help me that way," he is
said to have told his attorneys yester
day. '
A private detective employed by the
Peck family delivered to the district
attorney today 180 slides made for
use under the microscope and 100
test tubes which are believed to con
tain disease germs. The detective
found them in Waite's apartment.
Eugene O. Kane, the embalmer, and
a detective arrived here today from
Orient Point, L. I., bringing $7,800
in currency, part of the $9,000 which
Kane says White gave him as a bribe
to make him swear that the embalm
ing fluid used on the body of Mr. Peck
contained arsenic. Kane yesterday
guided the detective to the spot where
he had buried this money in a grove
of trees. - '

Efforts to confirm the report!
here were without result
El Paso, April 1. The capture ot
Francisco Villa by the flying squad
rons of American cavalry searching1
the Sierra Madre today is believed by
army officers at Fort Bliss to be only
a matter of days.
His forces scattered into small
bands after their smashing defeat by
Colonel Dodd and his cavalrymen on,
March 29, Villa is reported to navs
sought safety in hiding in some re

That Villa was already captured and
being brought back to the army base
at Casas Grandes was a report heard
here today, but it is not credited lh of
ficial quarters. While the hunt is on.
General Pershing, it is said, will con-'
tlnue his onerations aeainst -tha flee. 1

their concentration and to destroy .

General George Bell. ' commanding . N
the army base, is meanwhile moving
forward supplies to the front by way
of Columbus, that the American army
may be prepared for a possible pro
tracted campaign. '
Soldiers Combing; Country.
Somewhere in the barren mountains
of the continental divide, Francisco
Villa, wounded and crippled and with
but a handful of his followers, is be- -lieved
to be lurking today. Hard on :
his trail American troopers are comb-
ing every valley and ravine, searching '
every ranch house and adobe hut In -the
hope of ending the career of the
bandit. . - .
The feverish excitement caused
along the border by yesterday's news
of Colonel Dodd's victory at San Ger
onimo ranch had far from subsided
today. The fact that three days have
elapsed since the smashing blow de
livered at tho Villistas in the valley of j'
the Santa Maria, without any further t
news from General Pershing, has .
given birth to the most extravagant i
speculation anl rumors. ( ' j'

country in which he is hidinf and the
fact that most of the natives, of the
mountains are sure to do all they can'
to baffle the. American soldiers by
giving them false information and
leading them on wild goose chases. .
Everything apparently depends -noon
thespeed with which Villa is able
to move. If his Injuries have forced
him to seek safety in the mountains" of .
the divide, it is believed that. ; he Is
doomed although he may; elude, his:
enemies for many daya yet,- On the
