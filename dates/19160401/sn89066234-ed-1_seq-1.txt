SCOTT COUNTY
Vol. XV
BENTON, MO., APRIL 1, 1916.
No. 9,
The Circuit Court.
Prosecutor Daugherty Quits and Mc
Williams on Job.Other Doings.
The conduct of Prosecutor
'Daugherty in the court rootfl Inst
week w.ih such tlmt Mo was re
quested to unit the room. Hi"
isignatlon was secured and the
Kovernorappointed John McWil
t in ins. the former prosecutor, to
fill out the unexpired term.
Here is Another Instance of how
'the people" rule. In years gone
by, -when there wn a vacancy to
fill tor Office, there was nt least a
pretense At popular action. Peti
tions' were circulated for signa
tures askinR the governor to np
point thlsor that innn. or course
the petitions were only a blind to
mAke the people believe they had
something to say In government
The governor appointed whoever
was recommended by the little
group of politicians that control
tlie county. Now they have even
done away with the pretense of
letting the people have any ear.
This explains why locul capital
ists and politician! are so intense
ly active In the election of S gov
ernor. Capitalists and their pol
iticians are divided Into groups
one labelled Democracy and the
other Republican, In case of a
vacancy the group that controls
at Jefferson City names the suc
cessor. Federal jobs arc secured
In the Mine way.
The Kicker res rets the mi-
fortune that befell Mr. Daugherty
fecp down he has many good
qualities that have been smother
ed by his political affiliations
In point of ability I believe it will
le conceded that he outranks any
w ho have filled the office or pros
ecuting attorney since Marsh Ar
nold. n began life as a poor boy
and climbed, step by step, while
carina for a. Ml rearing a lnrj:"
family. He has no wealthy rela-
lives and, did not receUe the usu
al "protection" when trouble nt
peared, A few years ago a public
xrt.' ctal lay here in hi home for
weeks with delerlum tremens, it
was raid, and wns wholly Incapcl
tated for duty. But there was no
bint at removal. On the contra
ry, the thing was kept so quiet
that even the town people knew
it tie ol it.
Perhaps it cannot ie otherwise
under the existing crazy order of
-things, but the proceedings of
v hat we call courts have dwin
dled to a mere farce.. Of the -
aset on the criminal docket, ten
were dismissed last week by tin
prosecuting attorney and ten
were continued, The ten that
v.eie continued may be dismissed
1 1 the next term.
Either there was something In
these cases that were dismissed.
r
there was notning ii iw
as
i,(.iiii!ii in tnem, tnen
should eltliens be, compeueci to
lure lawyers and prepare to de
fend themselves? if. m the oth-
or
hand. Ul-iv was an' .l.-l 1 "
mm,
v hy
;lng the prosecutions,
were they dismissed';
then
s the Kicker w ent to i rest last
,eek V Lambert and lbert
ul longer were having a little
ouacI. it seems that Mr. Sullen-
er claims to 1-ic insolvent and
that Mr. Lambert la having to
a seeurlty debts for him, Mr.
Lambert brought an action to
try to find out ir Mr. Sullenger
was hiding any property, The ef
fort eeems rather unsuccessful 80
far. '
Thursday morning the civil
docked was called and nobody
seemed ready for action The
moot important cases for that
day were Howard Lev an vs. Win.
D. MoBrlde and M. V. Harris for
damages for a whipping admin
istered to Lev an at Blodgett, and
tin-case of the county aaainst ex
County Clerk McPheeters for the
tecovery of the shortage reported
to huc been found by the state
auditor's investigators. Both cas
es were continued.
The case of A. J. Hawn vs. An
ton lllattel for damages was set
lor trial next Monday. This ii
the case where Hawn was Injur
ed in a collision with liluttcl's
wagon on the Hock Levee. Hawn
was riding a motor cycle.
Then the docket for Friday was
tailed to see If anybody would be
ready in the cases for that day.
Everybody seemed to have "cold
reet, and the Jury was discharg
ed until Monday, Which practical
ly ended the court business for
the week.
A petit jury of 24 men alone
eosts the taxpayers 72 per day.
or something like a thousand dol
lars per term of court. Yet the
Jury was used In only three eases
ast week. Two of these cases
were so unimportant as to scarce
ly warrant the killina of time in
a Justice court Vera Watklns for
disturbing the peace and Jess Ha
ger for getting in somebody's
ben roost. The third was that or
Ton' Schott for feloneous assault
But the gentlemen who manipu
late "law and order" for their
own convenience and profit, do
not seem to care for expenses.
The workers in the fields and
shops foot the bills.
However, iso far as litigation is
concerned, the working class has
little to do with It. They have
nothing to "law" over. But It Is
the middle class that is now be
ginning to nell the ratchin- th.'
class that has yet a home and n
little property, These nre sub
jected to damage suits, and
Whether they Win or lose, they
nre nearly stripped by "the law."
Never, in the history of the
county, were there so many flam
ace suits in court, and thc in-
creaee with each term, But they
vote for it. To have the adminis
tration of Justice as Tree as edu
cation Would be Socialistic And
they don't want any "f that.
To have justice administered
rree would do away with nil the
Jugglery, trickery and delays
that now disgrace our courts
There would be no private profit,
caIIC'1 "fees." for anybody. The
humblest citizen would have the
same rights as the Hi -a; Pocket
Book the snme ns in our public
Schools, But. of course, such a
system would be detrimental to
class government and. therefore.
wouldn't work under capitalism
But, Mr. Free Born American
citizen, you get a little huffy at
the Kicker at times because it
telle yo i the unvarnished truth. I
am now going to tell you some
thing in a way that none of the
other papers will tell it.
All of your life yon have noticed
that the county court selected
the grand Jury, This was so a-
long as tne utile group wno can
themselves the Democratic part,
controlled the court.
Two years nao you selected B
county court and a clerk that is
not under the control of this par
ticular group, The law requires
a grand Jury once a year, The
county court may select thi
grand jury for either of the three
terms during the year, but thi
court usually waits until the last
term of the year unless a grand
Jury Is asked for earlier b,i the
prosecuting attorney, lint In case
the court neglects to select a
grand jury, for the last term of
the year, or if nny emergency
arises, then the prosecuting attor
ney may request the circuit judge
to order the sheriff to lelect one.
Last year was the first year in
which the new law changing the
terms of court went Into effect,
and the first regular term was In
July, The county court had not
been requested to provide a grand
jury, and did not do so But the
circuit judge ordered the sherl 'f
to select a grand Jury and for
what purpose no on? outside off
the Inner circle know.- to tills da.i
j The only thing that grand Jur.t
became noted for was it- nonm n
steal report about th "unbonded
I Assistant in the Highway engi
neers office.
I thought that was tif Km i
i "gall," tv nie now in the midst
I of the fiist term of court I u
1016, Tie county court provid
ed no grand Jury beca u n n
had been asked for. The county
court was in session Tuesday of
last week, and could have provid
ed a grand jury u requested t i
,;l so, Vet Wednesday morning,
Just after the county court ha :
adjourned, another grand Jurj
was ordered by the circuit court
-the some trick that was worked
last year.
Why? What are the Democrat
afraid of that they use such high
banded methods of controlling
the selection of gram! Juries1.' l
not a grand jury drawn from
I among hundreds Of names from
leach township more apt to be fair
and Impartial than a grand Jurj
selected by ne man'.'
Monday morning
went lnt(
the court'
i the court room as
i was insttuctlng the
grand jury
I It was the most beautifully Demo
cratic grand jury ever assembled
1 However, there w ere a few whose
! polities I did not know.
As I cnu rod, the judge w as in
structing them on the awful con
sequences of gaming, No matter
how innocent the game might ap
pear, it was harmful and it was
the grand jury's duty to take no
tice. He cautioned the grand j n
however, that business bouses
used punch boards and that tbej .
perhaps did not know this to be a
violation of law, Therefore the
soft pedal should be put on an I
the keepers of these gambling de
vices merely "warned."
While I felt like it, yet 1 feared
a fine, l felt that, as a law
abiding citizen, I ouaht to get up
and inform the court and the
grand jury that 1 still held a lot
tery ticket for which I paid a
dollar last summer, and that Fa
ther Helinbacher and Theon Ileis
serer won the automobile at the
Oran church picnic that I had
planned to ride In. But you hay
loft crap shooters had better
hide out. Criminal court business
is gettlmr a little dull.
Monday and up to Tuesday fore
noon the case of Claud Patterson
aaainst the Frisco railroad for
personal injury was on trial.
Patterson was ruptured in alight
ing from a train. A sudden jolt
as lie was leaving the train is al
leged to have thrown him and
caused the injury. The jury
awarded him $2,000.
TAKKN AT HIS WORD.

WH AT WE D' VT KN W
From Milwaukee Leader
The United States has the most
extensive and expensive organisa
tion for the collection of statis
tics In the wield it gathers
more facts that are of no use,
with many that a re useful, than
any other private or government
al body on earth.
But a fine discrimination is
shown In the collection and publi
cation of tnese fact.-. We know
exactly how many chickCnH there
are In the United States also how
many goats and pigs, We even
know the number of cattle at tin
various ages, ri well as the sex
But, according to the children's
bureau of the United states de
partment of labor. ''No one knows
how many mothers are at work
outside their homes."
We know exactly how many
persons have moved from any one
state In the union to another.
But we do not know how many
babies moved out of tiiis world
before they were one year old, or
any other age. or anything aba it
the ci onomlo conditions that ca -
ed t elr death.
We know to a c :it the val is of
e i ry article s: ippeo to a Foreign
country or Imported Into this one
It.it we have no figure" telling
how much money was extracted
from the prod icts of the working
class of this i ountry.
We are Informed, In great de
tails, iis to the exat number of
bushels of wheat, corn ol' potatoes
raised by the farmer but no
facts have been colli ted that
will tell how much of this pro
duct Is wasted or absoi d b
- it ts Idlers on the way
th
in.
consumers.
These omissions have been ma le
not by accident. Their .-elect on or
neglect was not made by any hit-
or-mlss method, Oi
Invariable
rule has been followed, and this
is the -rule: Whatever facts
would how the xploitatlou Ol
labor or condition- of labor due
to exploitations are not gathered,
or, if gathered, are not printed
The obverse of this rule, which is
always followed i-: Whatever
f;'cts will increase the power of
the exploiting class and add to
rent, interest and profits will be
collected and published regardless
of expense,
There are times when close dis
crimination Is necessary In order
to publish what the exploiters
need to know and not tell fact
or alue to labor, The census sta
tistics on manufacturing are an
illustration of the exercise oT thi
cautious judgment. These statis
tics go into detail on the amount
of products and the cost of pro
duction. But the figures are so
presented that it Is Impossible to
discover the shares received '.)
labor and capital, Lest someone
mia'it use th, in for this purposi
the tables are accompanied by a
footnote warning the reader that
the information he seek- on thl
point is not to be found in the ta
bles. The statistics on immigration
ofTer another illustration. Fig
ures are published giving the age,
nationality and destination and
present residence of all immi
grants. IJut nowhere is any in
formation given on the wages re
ceived by these immigrants or the
conditions under which they live.
It is because the commission on
industrial relations broke the
rules of the exploiters' union and
hunted up a lot of "undesirable
facts" that so strenuous an ef
fort is being made to prevent th?
publication of Its report.
DODGING ARGUMENT.
Crawfor How do you get your
wife to believe what you say
when you come home late?
Crabshaw I first listen to
what she accuses me of doing,
and then I own up to it. Judge.
Read the unmuzzled Kicker.

presides over the circuit Just
south of us. knows how to make
people be "good." While he maj
be a very aood man. he has a
Kith century mind. His cure for
evil Is to Compel people to go to
Church and Sunday school, For
him to sentence people to ao to
church is quite common, it wa
he who tri'd the New Madrid
county night riders.
The Melting pot, of St Lo is has
investigated the night rider affair
and prints its findings In the April
number, Among other things it
found that ' of the s arrested
farmers were Democrats, There
was but one Socialist and one Re
publican, J'et the kept newspa
pers howled that they were uii
clples of I'hil Ha f tier."
The Melting Pot contends that
when the officials of the landlord
arrested these farmers they were
believed to be Socialists, but that
when it was found they were
Democrats the soft pedal w as put
on and they were paroled, "The
party'- could not afford to lose
so many votes, in passing sen
tence Judge McCarty is quoted as
saying :
"1 will parole you on certain
conditions I want ,o; to ao
home nnd make good cltlfens
The co ;rt asks you to report le re
at each regular term, attend
Sunday school and church every
Sunday, have some good citizen
write the court at the l '(Inning

tend write the court and tell if

school, ir you do not comply
with thes" conditions the court
win revoke your parole nnd n '.
you to the penitentiary, The
s.ate's attorney Is Instructed to
watch that you comply w Ith
these conditions,"
That sure ought to make these
slaves be good. When the Church
and state co-operate in making
people be aood. there is no get
ting away from it D it th
trouble is. they have been at It
for nearly two thousand years
and the result are i. t encour
aging, Besides if the ch ireh is a

ABOUT FREE .SCHOOL BOOKS
The annual school meetings

of the districts the directors haw

true in the town, and it might b
a good idea for the voters nexi
T lesdaytoask for an expllnatlon
I can discover but one reason
Why the directors of any tow n
should fail to give the notice
That reason is that they are
more Interested in the town get

At present the money goes into
the town treasury, 14 the people

money would ao to supply the
books
The money comes from the for
eign insurance tax and is sent to
each county every year and then
distributed by the county court
to the various Incorporated towns
in proportion to the number of
school children, it was evidently
the original intention of the au
thor of the law to use the money
for school purposes, but it was
juanled until it got no furthci
than the town or city treasury,
so the legislature later amended
the law and made it possible forj

the abstractions, and yet v hat a
monstrous Inequality in the prl es
Inasmuch as aood tnings

1 all such things by riaiit belong ti
I those whose labor has produced
them. But it has so hapj encd, In
'all ages of the w n id. that som

I proportion of the fruits. This i
I wrong and should not continue.
To secure to each laborer the
j whole product of his labor, or as
I nearly as possible, is a worthy
object of any co. m.i government.

. CURIOUS CONTRIDUTTIONS,
' illia. rir... Mare!: s. v ruling
Hf eonsldernble ,nii"rt has been
rei cred by the supren e court 'if
1 Prisons, in sustaining an ArlsonQ
law permitting the infliction oJ a
days' Jail Imprisonment for each
ii t-- of unpaid fine, l was the
contention of the plaintiffs tnac
'tiiis was equivalent to Imprison
meat for debt and therefore ille
gal. The court upheld the right
of the state to Impose icb penalty-it
is the contradiction! of capi
talist law that makes it ridicu
lous and beyond understanding.
Imprisonment for debt Ii suppose 1
to have been abolished in this
country a century fiffo. Yet the
state, or town can jail you for
failure to pay a fine, or a hotel
keeper in Missouri can have you
Jailed for failure to pay a board
bill, if the principle is rijht in
one ease, why is it not riffht in
every ease?
Likewise the state has a law
making 0 per cent the legal rate
of interest, and interest In excess
of 8 per cent is illegal, let the
state violates this law continually
Let your taxes become delinquent
and you must pay the illegal rate
of 12 per cent.
And with our lawyer-made laws
all balled up until no one under
stands them, we are told that
only lawyers know how to make
laws. And they do know bow to
make laws for the beneiit of
lawyers.
