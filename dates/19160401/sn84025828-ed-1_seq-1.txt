ASK FOR WATER METERS
City Club Engineers Say They
Are Only Solution of Chicago
Water Problem,
City Club engineers have made a
report urging Immediate steps to rem
edy the city's water system.
Nearly half .the water pumped, ac
cording to the engineers, 1b wasted
through leaks, carelessness of con
sumers, and widespread extravagance
In the use of the water.
The report la signed by E.W. Bemla,
publlo utility engineer; Ray Palmer,
former city electrician, and Henry W.
Clausen, assistant city engineer.
Their principal recommendation Is to
mako the Installation of meters com
pulsory all over tho city.
"A serious problem confronts Chi
cago," tho report says. "During the
months of largest water waste hi tho
very cold and In very hot weather tho
pressure Is insufficient for the fourth
floors of apartment houses, the num
bor of which is rapidly increasing.
"In any considerable fire at somo
dtstanco from a largo main enough
water might not be obtained for effi
cient servlco by several engines pump-

lng at once. Most large cities main
tain a much higher pressure In resi
dence districts than does Chicago."
The engineers recommend that three
preliminary steps bo taken at once:
"The city council should appropriate
$10,000 for the construction of meter
vaults at the curb where they, cannot
be aet In basements.
"All unmetered premises devoted In
whole or part to business and all pub
llo buildings should be metered.
"The city water department should
havo the authority to set meters not
only as now, whero tito frontage rate
Is $100 per year and more, but whoro
It Is 50 per year. Later the limit
should bo reduced to $25 a year."
' In Chicago the per capita putnpage
of water1 Is 354 gallons, or twice as
much as most largo cities where me
tcrs are universal.
