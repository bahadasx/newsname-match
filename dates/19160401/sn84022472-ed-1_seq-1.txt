Visited toy a. fpair of -desperate rob
bers for the second time withintwo
weeks, Nathan Glasner, "pawnbroker of
497 Water street, was the victim of a
murderous assault 'at 9:30 this morn
ing. The robbery was performed with
two policemen within one blocs" of the
store at the time. Money .and stock
worth $300 was stolen. :. -- ,
Glasner was arranging & show case
in his store when two- men, apparently
about 2 and -2 5 years .of-age; well
dressed, and of American descenti en
tered the place. They asked to be
shown a pair of second hand knives.
' Glasner was . opening a drawer con
taining the knives when he was sud
denly blinded by a handful of pepper;
The prwnbroker pulled a. revolver from
the drawer and .fired a shot at the men.
They both ducked behind the counter
and Glasner, temporarily blinded by
the burning pepper, was unable to see
them when they rushed towards him.
-' One of the young men who had a
revolver in his hand, struck the pawn
broker over the head with ... the
weapon and Glasner. fell to the floor
Jn a semi-conscious state. Both rob
bers grabbed him and ' one held the
proprietor while the other bound and
gagged him. A handful of waste cot
ton was placed in-his ; mouth -and
bound with a leather ' strap. Glasner
was then trussed up with some pieces
of hawser rope. The robbers . picked
him up and . carried him -to a rear
room where one stood guard over him
while the other ransacked the safe.
The revolver shot was not heard by
pedestrians on the streets and the rob
bers were unmolested Jn their work;
A gang of street" cleaners under the
direction of Florence Farace, working
outside the store,' failed to hear the
revolver shot. '
While . one young man ; kept watch
ove Glasner the other ' opened the
door of the old fashioned safe, which
is in the xear end of the dark, gloomy
pawn shop. He extracted. $70 in
small bills and $50 in $5 bills, and
then took a dozen or more gold filled
watches. The loot was placed in the
robbers potckets.
By this time Glasner -had regain
ed consciousness .and he began to
scream for help. He ceased yelling
when one of the robbers thrust a
revolver into his mouth and half
way down hia throat, threatening to
shoot if Glasner did not cease calling
jfor help.' , i-7 "- , s- -- - V kj,
-With a loot valued at approximate
ly $300 the robbers left the -place
while Glasner lay groaning in pain.
His hands had been bound in front
of his body and ' after half an hour
he was able to extricate himself.
Rushing to the street he screamed
for the police.
Policeman Edward C. Wheeler ran
to the pawn shop. Wheeler had been
in there 10 minutes before the rob
bery occurred. He and Policeman
John McCarthy left thq shop, each
going 'in a' different direction. . On
reaching the nearest corner each- po
liceman stopped" and was ' standing
near at the time of the raid. '
The pawn-shop has a gloomy in
terior and pedestrians on the sidte
walk cannot see farther than 10 ffleet
inside the entrance. Glasner was the
. victim of robbers who assaulted him

ago. Tuesday morning at . the same

More than a 'score of the business
men of Bridgeport and -the upper, end
of Fairfield -county besides, hundreds
of . men - now ' prominent in business
from all over the eastern part of the
country, received the solid' foundations
of instruction upon which their suc

brain. For the past decade he has not
been actively engaged in teaching but
lived peacefully on his estate in Trum

FINE PHYSICIANS
WHO BROKE NEW
FEDERAL RULINGS
Four Bridgeport Doctors As
sessed Amounts Varying
From $25 to $100.
SEVEN MEDICOS IN
TROUBLE OVER DOPE
Men Who Helped Victims
Get Narcotics Settle and
Avoid Publicity.
-
Six Bridgeport physicians, and one
In an adjacent town have run afoul of
the United States revenue department.
Within the last few days fines varying
from 25 to $100 have been meted out
by the Federal authorities to four of
the local jnedicps, and to the physi
cian in an adjacent town.
Four of these physicians have paid
their fines. Two, one of whom hasn't
been fined, but warned, are expected
to settle their difficult' es by explana
tion, one case is so serious that it will
be prosecuted in the United States dis
trict court in May.
Violations bf the Harrison narcotic
law are alleged. In four of these
cases, supplying drug victims lies at
the bottom of the investigations made
by the revenue department. By pay
ment of the fines without protest, the
physicians avoid tthe publicity of trial
in the federal courts, and their names
and offences remain secrets In the fed
era! archives.
Every physician involved is among
the prominent men of the profession
Two men of especially good repute in
the profession violated the Harrison
law unintentionally, it is thought,
either through carelessness ' or unfa-
miliarity with the Federal ruling on
narcotics. One of these physicians.
who, was fined, failed to record the
name and address of the person for
whom he wrote a prescription. He
expects to get his fine remitted. The
other, who was merely warned, gave a
narcotic prescription to a trained
nurse without obtaining and recording
the name of the patient for which it
was intended.
Two more physicians .are under
surveillance.
The warning of Judge E. S. Thom
as last February when he fined a
Stamford physician, is being taken, to
heart by physicians here today. Judge

Commissioners Will Report
More. Than Ten Millions
Worth of Construction
Permits For Fiscal Year
Ending Yesterday.
t
Permits For More Than One
Million Dollars Issued
Durinsr One Week New
Construction Work Here
Will Boost Next Tax List
permits for-buildings to cost more
than ten million dollars were granted
by Bridgeport's board of building com
missioners for their fiscal year ter
minating on April 1. V
This surpasses by far the largest
records in the city's history. 'Scrutiny
of the records of the building commis-
raonera shows that in all there were
1,818 building perrmits granted, the
aggregate cost of the buildings being
510,363,165.
The valuation for 1915-1916 Is almost
three times the total valuation of 1914
1915, It indicates that the tax list for
1916. which' is made up as of Septem
ber 1, 1916, will show an Increase of
several millions from new buildings
alone. The building boom did not
swell the tax list for 1915 greatly be
cause the, new building work, by Sept.
1, 1915,, had not progressed to such a
stage as to give the physical Valua
tions to the proposed plants, for pur
pose of taxation.
The report of the building commis
sioners- is not yet ready for the com
mon council, but it is expected at the
next meeting of the common council.
Much of this enormous sum which
has been spent here during the past
fiscal year hag. been -for factory con
struction Including' the great works
of the Remington Arms and Ammuni
tion" Co. north of Boston avenue, the
additions to the Union Metallic Cart
ridge Co. plant, Bridgeport Brass Co.',
Harvey Hubbell Co. and other fac
tories. In , addition many costly
houses have been erected in what is
known as "Remington City." - A num
ber of ' business blocks have been
erected during the year. '
During the week of ApriK17 there
were issued 18 building permits. The
estimated cost of the buildings was
$1,103,640. j This was the . record
week of the year. There is consider
able difference between the figures
for this week and that of January
7, when but 13 permits was issued
and the estimated cost was $17,190,

BRIBE FUND IS
$1,200 SHORT
New York, April 1 The, discrep
ancy between the $9,000 which Dr.
Arthur Warren Waite declares he gave
Eugene C, Kane, an embalmer, to
swear falsely that there was arsenic
in the. embalming fluid he used on
the body of John E. Peck, of Grand
Rapids, for whose murder Waite is
indicted,-and the $7,800 which Kane
dug up from its hiding place on Long
Island yesterday, was made the sub
ject of an investigation by District
Attorney Edward Swann today. -
According - to Kane's story, the
large roll of bills, which Waite said
contained $9,000, was forced into hia
hands at an appointed meeting place
and he never counted the money dur
ing the time it was in his possession.
Therefore, he said, he did not know
the value of the roll when he buried
it.
Otherswho were called to the dis

with the case today were three young
women whose names are said to have
been found in Waite's memorandum
