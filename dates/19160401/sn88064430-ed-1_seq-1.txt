The Supreme Court decided agamass
the jitney drivers of New Orleans
when they handed down a decision
declaring the city ordinance impos
ing an indemnity bond of $n,000 upon
each machine to be constitutional. As
the case now stands, it indicates that
the jitney business is doomed. The
only recourse now of the jitney owner
N- is the Federal Court, to which an ap
peal will be taken from the decision
of the state court.
Cost of a $5,000 Indemnity bond
would be so great that the operating
of a jitney would be unprofitable, the
'E Jitney drivers declare.
Practically all of the machines are
individually owned, that is, one or
two men owning one machine. In.
stances are few of where one man or
company owns more than one automo
bile. Most of them are operated in
partnership, one man running the car
from 6 o'clock in the morning until
late in the afternoon and being re.
lieved by the other who drives until
te after midnight.
)n- The premium on an indemnity bond
to is necessarily high, it is said, because
ar the insurance company faces the prob
'x- ability of paying out the entire
!ul amount of the policy on one accident.
he The case was decided in a test case
id made by the city againt Hoa LeBlane,
ra who was fined $10 or eleven days in
CS, jail for refusing to comply with city
er ordinance 2346, which required the
v- $5,000 bond. This is the second time
Il- the Supreme Court has passed on the

an Chief Justice Frank A. Monroe and

PROTECTION.
td
11 New York.-Charges of collusion
between agents of the internal reve
nue department and manufacturers of
cigars and cigarettes, who are alleged
° to have been evading the law, have
L, been brought to the attention of gov
n ernment officials, it became known in
" connection with the wholesale ar
rests here of manufacturers accused
n of misusing or failing to use internal
revenue stamps. Government omcials
t. who are conducting the crusade so
- mitted that such charges were being
I- investigated.
Ninety warrants had been issued for
e alleged violators of the Internal reve
nue laws and 47 persons had been ar
rested. Each of the accused was held
t in $1,500 ball for the federal grand
II jury.
a The charges of collusion have come
I principally from the accused manu
facturers, some of whom are said to
have declared they had been paying
r from $1 to $10 a week to revenue
agents for "protection" against prose
cution.
Officials of the department of Inter
nal revenue and of the Department
of Justice asserted that violations of
the law had been going on for years
5 and declared the government had been
defrauded of millions of dollars In
fees.
Not only the government but the
consumers have been defrauded, ac
cording to L. G. Nott, collector of in
ternal revenue. At some of the fac
tories raided boxes were found, he
said, which originally had contained
expensive imported cigars, but which
had been refilled with an inferior imi.
tation made on the East Side. These
cigars, he said, were sold over the
counter as the genuine imported
product. Most of them bore clever
imitations of the bands of popular
high-class cigars.
Lincoln to Leave Soon.
Washington.-Department of Jas
tice officials have about decided that
Ignatius T. T. Lincoln, the confessed
German spy locked up In New York
pending extradition to England, on
the charge of forgery, possesse little
Information of use in prosecuting nen
trality cases. His deportation proba
bly will not be long delayed. Lincoln,
who escaped from a deputy marshal
soon after this first arrest, sent word 4
to the department he intended to 1
break jail. He declares the charge of I
forgery against him is merely a sun
terfuge of the British government to
secure his return to England that be I
may be executed as a spy.
Gold Found In Florida.
Tampa, Fla.-Gold in Florida is re
realed by assay certificates made by I
a Cripple Creek (Colo.) assayer or I
Pred Renner of Valrico, about 11 1
miles from Tampa. Renner, who is 4
an old prospector, came across the I
ledge while digging a well near a lake. e
It bore the marks of gold-bearing rock
and he sent three samples to an as
sayer. The samples showed gold
values of $3.20, $11.20 and $17.60 a 1
ton. So far as known this is the first I
discovery of gold in Florida.
"JItney" Law Is Upheld.
New Orleans, La.-The State Su. s
preme Court in a decision reversed its I
decision of last November and held
the New Orleans jitney ordinance to
be valid. The ordinance requires a
$5,000 indemnity bond for each il- A
ehine operated. Attorneys for the t

the Supreme Court of the United fI

San Antonio, Texas.-Francisco Vil
e la has escaped from the Mexican
r troops that had checked him near
Id Namiquipa, and three columns of
American cavalry are pursuing him.
Already they are almost 250 miles
e south of the border, and unless Mexi
. can forces bring the elusive bandit to
another stand this distance will be
g greatly increased by the close of the
e week.
L Villa's success in extricating him
self from the dangerous posltion into
r. which he had been driven by the
it American punitive force was related
It in a detailed report of Gen. Pershing
x that reached Gen. Funston. Gen.
n Funston forwarded the report to
n Washington without making public
any but the essential features.
e Col. Dodd is commanding the ad
vanced columns that are riding hard
t. after Villa and his men, and Gen.
-- Pershing has divided his forces so as
e to provide supporting columns along
I the thinly stretched lines of commu
h nications from his most advanced
I. base at El Valle. From El Valle an
e other line is being maintained back
e to Casas Grandes, from where com
I munication with the border is main
r tained. Gen. Pershing himself is
r somewhere south of Casas Grandes di
recting the work of holding together
his forces and directing as far as pos
sible the operations of Col. Dodd. Ca
r valry is being used along the lines
t communicating with El Valle, where
I a detachment of infantry is sta
k tioned.
I Three aeroplanes are at El Valle
e and will be used in scouting as soon
as the high winds that have been
r sweeping that part of Mexico for Al
most a week subside, and which, a
I cording to Gen. Pershing, have made
I effective assistance by them impossi
ble. Of the eight machines that went
I into Mexico, two are still out of com
mission. They were damaged in the
lights from Columbus to Casas
Grsndes.
To Hold Civilian Camp.
Washington.-The score or more of
military training camps throughout
r the country planned for the next few

ed that the camps woumd be held.
2,000 Ships Off Seas.
Washington.-The Euqopean war
has taken from the seas more than
2.000 merchant vessels of nearly 4,
000,000 tons, according to figures pub- a
lished by the Department of Com- i
merce. Germany, with 600 vessels
sunk, captured or interned, heads the t
list of losers.

ARMY INCREASE
MEASURE PASSED
HAY MEASURE PROVIDES FOR
140,000 FIGHTING MEN, IN
STEAD OF 100,000.
Washington.-The Hay army In
crease bill, providing for a regular
army peace strength of 140.000 fight
ing men instead of the present 100,
000, passed the House by a vote of
402 to two. It goes to the Senate
for immediate consideration virtual*
ly as drafted by the House committee.
The negative votes were cast by
Representatives Britten, Republican,
of Illinois, and London, Socialist, of
New York. Mr. Britten opposed the
bill because he favored a still further
increase in the army and Mr. London
because he favored no increase.
The bill is the first of the great na.
tlonal preparedness measures urged
by President Wilson to pass either
House, although various related meas
urea have been approved. It was final
ly adopted only after Representative
Kahn, ranking Republican member of
the military committee, had again met
defeat, this time 213 to 191, in his ef
fort to increase the authorized
strength of the regulars to 220,000.
During the debate Chairman Hay
of the committee which drew the bill
referred to it as "the president's own
bill." It was explained at the White
House, however, that while the presi
dent approved the ground plan of the
measure, he was not committed to its
details. The conference on the Sen
ate and House plans, to come after
the Senate acts, is expected by the
administration officials to produce a
bill which will have the president's
full support.
Carranza Troops Rebel.
Douglas, Ariz.-Numerous reports
have reached the United States mill
tary authorities that open rebellion
has broken out among the Carranza
troops at Cabullona, 18 miles south of
here. Americans here are seriously

five words.
