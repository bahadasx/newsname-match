Onirage ut Minaca.
The last outrage placed to (he ac
count of Villa, and pi nimbly the final
murderous exploit of which he will
ever hoist, occurred at Minaca, it
town about ten miles southeast of
Guerrero on the Mexico Air Ot lent rail
road. Here the Villlstas are reported
to have murdered u mine foreman
named Herman I slankenburg and two
other foreigners. It Is feared that
the two unknown victims were Amer
icans. Four Americans, Acklin, Dr.
Still, IletlipU' nnd Locke, are known
'to have been recently In or near
Minaca. It is not certain that Villa.
1 himself took part in these murders
-as it is hardly possible that he could
'have made his way from Miiiiiim to
the San Geionimo ranch, thirty miles
to the northeast, in the time elapsing;
! between the murder of the three for
eigners and the battle on the ranch,
j Sometime before the crime of Mi
, mii'ii, Villa descended on Guerrero
i where he slaughtered all the C.ir-
I ruiicistas he could find. After lhc
lie suggested j battle on the Sail Geroninio rancn tho
him, , Waite American .soldiers rclciised a lal'tpf
sane as yon number of General Currnnza's men
whom the ban. Ill chief was holding L
murder at his leisure. Jt is probablo
that it was at the Guerrero massacre
