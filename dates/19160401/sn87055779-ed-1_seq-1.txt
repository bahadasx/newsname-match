SGH LLER VOWS
HE IS !0T PIRATE
Stowaway Who Captured
British Ship Brought to N.
Y. For Safe Keeping.
International News Service:
NEW YOIiK. April 1. Ernest P.
Schiller, the "2Hh century Captain
Kidd." who singlehanded captured
and held for 1A hour the Hritish
vessel Matopho with her ,"T men.
w-as brought to New York today hy
federal officers for safekeeping". In
formation that an attempt would he
made to rescue him if he was kept
at Ixnvcs, Iel.. caused the authori
ties to bring him here, Schiller
talked freely upon his arrival.
"They can't say I didn't warn
them." he declared. "Why. I wrote
a letter from Hobokcn to the Hritish
consul-general. Sir Clive Bay ley,
telling him I wan oing to capture
one of his ships."
'"But. even then," he continued.
"thewe ".7 Britishers couldn't handle
me It took Americans to do that."
Dorla it's Mo i Not Pirate.
Schiller's chief concern seemed to
!e what disposition will lie made of
him by this government. He ei
lently fears he will be turned over
to the British authorities as a pirate
to meet a pirate's fate.
"The British want me for piracy."
he declared. "I am not a pirate.
Those .7 Britishers couldn't capture
me. so the British don't deserve to
nave me. The United States should
treat me as a prisoner of war. To
the victor should go the spoils, and
the victor in this rase is not the
British, but the Fnited States coast
guard service."
Schiller had little of the heroic
about his appearance upon his arri
val here. His1 face and frame were
emaciated, hi.s clothing torn and
stained and he walked with a mark
ed stoop. He looked like the last
person on earth to carry through
on" of the meist dare-devil exploits
in recent maritime historv.

WASHINGTON. April 1. Two
bright new buds were added today
to Washington's growing crop of re

were:
Maj. (Jen. Leonard Wood, former

Prof. Edmund Janes James, pres

Both of the new additions to the
lonp list of republican possibilities
were trotted out by representatives
of the same brands of republicans.
Both have supporters among the
progressive element of the party
and are satisfactory to many of the
"preparedness" group among th
republicans. Furthermore, word h.ls
come to republicans in "Washington,
on reliable, hat underground au
thority, that either Gen. Wood or
Prof. James will be satisfactory t
Col. Theodore Roosevelt. If condi

Four U. S. Troopers Wounded in Battle
After Traveling 55 Miles in l 7
Hours on Hard Roads.
FAMOUS ITH CAVALRY
Intorna'icn.il New Sorvi.-e:
HL PASO. Texas. April 1. That
Francisco "ilia, his fori es routed by
Ii. Americans in the battle at ,?an
Ceroninio and himself wounded, will
be unable to escape capture or death
for many days was the belief ex
pressed by United States officers at
Fort Bliss and Gen'. Gaviera. eom
mander at Juarez Friday. Three
days have passed since Wednesday's
conflict, which the Americans won
after traveling miles in IT hour
along a difficult road, and it is ex
pected that the rvews coming from
Gen. Pershing will io more
thrilling details of the battle.
The outstanding fact is that illas
I ower has been smashed.
Defeated by a force numerically
smaller, and fleeing before the 'grin
goes,'1 for whose fighting power h
had often expressed contempt, it is
believed here that most of his fol
lowers will desert and that if he at
tempts to hide in one of his moun
tain h ns. his betrayal is certain.
Co!. Dodtl Hero of Hour.
The border is still ringing with
praise of Col. George A. Dodd. who
led the American troops in their
dash to San Geronimo. Though
Pershing directed the plan of am
I ait:n. it is understood that th
movement which resulted in Villa's
defeat was made by Dodd upon his
own initiativ, he having been out of
communication with his superior for
t vv o days.
The famous seventh cavalry. 'lis
ter's old command, responded in
aide fashion to the colonel's call for
more speed in the dash to get Villa,
and their marksmanship in the
battle that ended the dash resulted
in heavy lof-s to tha Villistas.
Of the Americans in the battle
none was killed outright. Four v ere
wounded and Gen. Bell, the com
mander at Fort Bliss, lias received
word that one of them w ;is fatally
injured.
Border Tears I)tellel.
Fears- that have prevailed along
the uorrter since the p'. nit ive expedi
tion entered Mexico have been pret
tc rffcr'u. illy dispelled by the victory
von '.v the American troop- in their
til st clash with the Villistas. Mor
bid if..ensi on the border state. that
feared that any rev eise for the
Americans would be the signal for a
general Mexican uprising that woabl
(Xtend even to the Mexican sections
on the frontier town;'. This danger
has b n ompletely av oide.J. accord
ing to observers here, by Fol. Dodd's

The daily rumor of a raid by Mex
icans into American territory reach

effect that a small hand of bandit.-
had e rosse 1 the border le miles east
of Fl Paso ;itid robbed an American
