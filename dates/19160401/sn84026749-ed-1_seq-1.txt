Information that the Dutch govern

sinking of the Dutch liner Tubantla has
created a profound sensation In official
quarters here.
Whether the mobilisation signifies an
Intention on the part of Holland to

or Is Intended to serve as a warning to
Germany against a repetition of sub
marine attacks on Dutch merchantmen.
Is not disclosed.
All the American Government has to
go on thus far are the Dress dispatches
today from London.
These dispatches say Queen Wllhel
mlna has sumohtd both houses of the
Dutch Parliament to meet In special
session on Hunday to consider the sink
ing of the Tubantla.
From thi alt Is Inferred the official In
vestigation by the Dutch government
has convinced Queen Wllhelmlna that
a German submaiino was responsible;
although the German minister t The
ItSEUd Is reported to have Insisted a
German submarine could not have been
responsible.
Thus far the State Detmrtment has
not received from Minister Von Dyke
at The Hague & report on the Dutch
Investigation. It is realized, however,
that If tho evidence adduced by that In
ventlgatlon is conclusive. It may have
an Important bearing on the course or

AMBULANCE LIKELY
TO BE EXEMPTED IN
Chairman of House Subcom

Restrict Vehicles.
ONLY FOR COMMON SENSE
Says Drivers Should Be Careful
But Should Be Allowed to
Go Fast.
It became probable today that when
the Judiciary subcommittee of tne
House District Committee considers the
Miller bill, regulating the speed of auto
mobiles In the District, an amendment
will be offered exempting hospital am
bulances from the speed laws.
Congressman Carl Vinson, chairman
of the subcommittee, said today he was
entirely out of sympathy with the cam
paign of the Police Department to hold
ambulances down to the present speed
limits.
"It Is foolish." sold Mr. Vinson. "In
talk of nnibulunccs going nt twolvo or
fifteen miles un hour In emergency
cases. An ambulance should rave the
ilpht-of-wny and should travel at what
ever speed may b necesoary to save
the II fo of an Injured man or to get
him tn the hospital (illicitly.
"If I should lv Inti-red on th strets

twelve miles an hour and to wait for

"I would not be nrrrsn to an amend
ment to tho Miller bill which would
exempt ambulances from tho orwratlDn
of the proposed now speed law.
"I do not think that a definite limit
of speed r.hould be put on ambulances,
although I would expect them to re
spond to calls In n common-sense
manner and In a life and death case
I a greater speed Is excusable than In
a minnr injury case
Tho Miller bill, which proposes to
fix an elgtheen-mlle maximum apeod
for the operation of automobiles In

committee of which Mr. Vinson Is

EL PASO, April 1. Villa, the
bandit, terror of the Sierras, today
is believed to be but a step in ad
vance of the troopers of Colonel
Dodd's Seventh Cavalry, bent upon
his capture, dead or alive.
Villa and the remnants of his
band, scattered by the engagement
with the American forces at San
Geronimo, were believed to be hid
ing in the fastness of thty Continent
al Divide. They are probably mak
ing (heir way by slow stages to
some stronghold known only to
Villa.
RUMORS OF CAPTURE. '
Reports of Villa having been cap
tured have circulated since Dodd's
victory, and Carranza Consul Uarcla
today denied one Mich rumor, attrib
uted to Juarez officials.
Garcia reported a concentration cf
Carranzista troops in Torreon to wipe
out banditry In the Laguna district.

they will be sold to the army. W hen
the train left Juarez It contained no
military guard and one American vias
aboard.
Stripped for Action.
Colonel Dodd's command is literally
"stripped for action' Tho four men
wo.mded in tho ungagoment in which
thlrty-cno VJlllstas wero killed, have
been sent to tho rear. Dodd and his
men are living off the country. They
are foraging for food for their hoi sen.
They have but one object in mind
to brlrK Jjnck. Villa.
