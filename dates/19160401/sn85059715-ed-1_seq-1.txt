successful meeting In that city:
One of the most eloquent, logical
and captivating preachers, who has
ever appeared here is the Rev. Frank
Jackson, of Bluefield, W. Va., who has
just concluded a two weeks' meeting
at the State street Methodist church.
Mr. Jackson Is a man- of great earnestnes
sand his preaching created great
Interest and: accomplished {nuch .good.
He Is. a man of striking personality,
has an excellent voice, graceful and
easy gestures and withal is a model
in all that which ^inspires confidence
and appeals to the best there Is In
man.
No man since Sam Jones was here
uu ou uruubeti wviuir tfrwn ana
Its community as did the preaching ot
the Her. Mr. Jackson. H< Is scrlpural,
evangelical; and with all very plain
and practical. His sermons go right
to the hearts of hla hearers. He is not
sensational and usee no Questionable
bethods to get people to profess conversion.
He preaches the plain gospel
out o fa warm heart and calls for
penitents In the old-fashioned way.
There wa sa number of converts. The
meeting has left an Impression for
righteousness on Howling Green that
will tell in years to come.

From unofficial sources it-Is
earned that many of the bombs'were
trapped either into the sea or in
places where no damage was done.
It was an ideal night for the raid,
everything was in favor of the Zeppelins.
Including the atmospheric
pressure and'the lightness of the
