One of the features of the
campaign during the present
week was the appearance on the
stump of Lieutenant Governor
Barret, defeated in the recent
primary, who spoke at Leesville
Vernon parish, Monday night, in'
behalf of his successful opponent
He dwelt largely upon the obli
gation of the primary, declaring
that the man 'who participated
could not with honor refuse to
support the nominee. Mr. Barret's
splendid example will have a
splendid effect upon those who
followed him in the primary con
test. The Louisiana supreme
court, in a decision on this point
said, in the case of LaBauve vs.
Michel, 121 Louisiana:
"That the voter, by parti
cipating in a primary, im
pliedly promises and BINDS
HIMSELF IN HONOR to
support the nominee, and
thata statute which exacts
'rom him an express promise
to that effect adds nothing to
his moral obligation and does
not undertake to add any
thing to his legal obligation."
In other words, the man who
I wl' tot pay a debt unless he isH
forced to do so by law, falling to
consider his moral obligation in
the matter, is in much the same
category as the man who refuses
to. carry out his political obliga
tion simply because there is no
law to compel hqn to do so.
Moral obligation is much higher
and strrnger than legal obliga
tion with a ecruopufualy honest
man, and no sort of argument.
can convince an honest man toe
the contrary. This is the senti
ment expressed by Ieut. Gover
nor Barret in his Leesyvtle speech

We cannot but comment very unfavor
ably on the condition of the Reserve
Edgard Ferry, and we behieve that our
Police Jury should sre at once that
conditions there be improved to meet
E the demands of the contract. We cape
elaily recommend that the said ferry
provide at once suitable landuigs o-.
carry safely at least 25 p.asengers, and
have a regular scheoule in operati.on.
said schedule to be published in the ta
rich papers, and on a schedule table da

galton the ferries at Garyvide and La
Place are giving satisfactory service.
Public Roads
We have examined the public roanf
in District No 1, and whilp we fbut
improvements, we are of the opmilit
jiha' the roads are not c'ragged otter
enough, and the road commissioner.
should see that they are dragged at
l teast after each rain. The tracuon en
Sgue should be kept in working at at
times and not allow the roads to get ful.
of holes and deep ruts because the en
gine it out of order for as long am fite
consecutive weeks. We are of the opi
nion that the road man should devot.
his entire time and attention to the pub
lic roads
we have examined the public roads in
Distriot No. 2, and while we also fino
improveueuts, we believe that more at
tention should be given to the roads bj
the road man, who should also devote
all his time to the work. The bridged
requiro some grading and should be
attended to at eece.
Jail
We have examined the rail, and we
are of the opinion that same should be
given a thorough cleaning out, new
bedding installed, and that disinfectant r
should not be used in such strong quant- i
Lity. Some places in the walls shoul'd
be repaired immediately; II
RBeommendatioone "
We earnestly request that our police
Jury give immediate attention to the C
following very important recommend- "1
tione.,
I We recommend that means be
devised towards improving the very
dangerous curves ac Voisin's at Re
serve and at Bougere's Woodland-Ge
belin at La lacoe
2 We recommend that the police jury `
exert its best effort towards getting toe
S& M. V. R R to place signals or oells t
No 21 crossing at Belle poinat and at
Woodland Orossing. .
' We strongly recommend that the
police Jury furnish the different officr s
aid court room of the court house with
up to date furniture provide suitable d.
eots fot jurymen who at ti as have to i
remain lockad up over night; and give .
sddiuonal room tor the proper and PI
mte fling of imnportant records in the ;.
:lark's office. . d
4 We recommend that the bord of .e
.a'ish I'reaeu-er be increnawd t. 4104
10 00 as we c ,usider his preseut bond
f $5000 entirely too low
We recommenend that a system of
economy he adopted by our polleoe jury
which system shuld include among o h.er
things a reluction aw the salary of the
Secretary of the police jury, whose pre
seat salary is 137 60, and we recomrmend
that said salary be cut to the sum of $25
as it was tn the past, We also reaom
Imend proportional cuts in salaries of of
Hler, who received an increase in recen
years.
6.. We reoommend that the jailer be
instructed to keep a regular time ac.
count of each prisoner, which account
Sis to be seperate and distinct from the
one kept by the sheriff.
7. We recommend that the police Ju
ry get bids on our parish deposits, and
that sme be placed in bank giving the
best Daeneial inducements.
i8 We recommend that for the acconmoda
tion of wote and commissIoners and
