"My object in bringing up the lhaU

with the regular election of aldermen,
on whether or not the city council

lire department to your minds, la tot
enlighten the general public on tho(
nature of such election, as there 13 a"
certain amount of misunderstanding;
pn'ong tho voters and general paBIIc.
tn regard to such election.
"First, I desire to inform the V0ter3
and tax payers that this is not a bond
ssue, but is merely a vote, giving tof
iho city council the power to expend,
i rum of approximately $10,000 for th
purpose of purchasing one) motors
pumping engine and one roadster to!
bf3 used by the fire chief.
"This matter has been discusseff aft
length by the city council and all thef
members of the council have TOted to?
have the proiosltion up to you. voters
Wo believo that the city needs uuclil
improvement Li fire department, &'
F.ome o. the horses now serving on the
department are old and we will bor
compelled to buy more horses land",
owing to the searcrty of such hurses
wo would have to have, caused by
the war, they would cost about J500!
or 5000. We must. make some Im
provemenhi, either horses or motor
apparatus and we believe It Is mora
economy in the long run to purchase
motor equ'pniont. and by doing bo wa
c an dispose of four horses. Our book
show that this item, alone la saving
at least $tn) per year as it costs about;
$500 to feed four horses one year,
while tho reports from other . cities
which have more fires than Chicka
sha has. show that the upkeep of mo
tor machln-33 is not more than fifty;
dollars per year each. All citizens)
know- that when motor apparatus 13
standing idle there is no expense
while the expense of horse drawn apj
pnratus is i;oing ou continually regard
less of fire calls.
"Second, I wish to state the propc
sition as to how we Intend to pay for;
such apparatus, If the election is in'
favor of same. We will have funds;
available that can lawfully be applied;
upon such improvements to make a!
substantial payment down at time oC
receipt of machines. In other words
we can pay approximately one-halt
down when equipment is received, and,
can pay the remainder on the Ieas3
purchase plan; that is, we can pay,
?t.0 per month, or $1800 per year, anl
if the valuation of city remains as ilj
is at present the city can pay for bucU
ecjuipmsnt In a very few years and nc
one will ever miss the amount it cost
"The inquiry is often made, Low?
much will this machine reduce the in
siii-ance rates? In reply to same wilt,
ray that we have letters from that
state rating bureau which states that
by the purchase of such improve'
meDts the rates will be cut betweert
four and five thousand dollar per)
yer.r. Howevjr we can not guarantee
that the rates will be cut as there M
1:0 guarantee to us from the rating
l-ureau, but regardless of Insuranc
rates we need the Improvement.
"I want to close by saying that T
as mayor of your city, am heartily id
favor of making the purchase as I bo
lieve the city need the improvements
"Thanking you for your consider'
tion in this matter. I am ;'ours toi
