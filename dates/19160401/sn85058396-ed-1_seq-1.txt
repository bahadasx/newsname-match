El Paso, Texas, April 1. The cap
ture of Francisco Villa by the flying
squadrons of American cavalry search

I March 29, Villa is reported to have
sought safety In hiding In some re

broken by a gunshot wound, or a fall

KILLED IN RAID
British Report Casualties of
Zeppelin Flight Over Eng
land's Eastern Countries.
MANY BOMBS DROPPED
Anti-aircraft Guns Damage
"One Dirigible, the" C-15,
Which Falls Into the Sea.
London, April 1, 3 59 p. m. Twenty
eight persons were killed and forty
four injured in last night's air raid,
according to official figures given out
today.
It was officially announced this af
ternoon that the Zeppelin dirigible
balloon which fell into the sea was
the L-15.
One of the five Zeppelins which vis
ited tho eastern counties of England
during the night dropping some nine
ty bombs, was damaged, presumably
by British anti-aircraft guns, and same
down off the Thames estuary. It sur
rendered to British patrol boats. Tho
crew was saved but the airship broke
up and sank while being towed In.
Twenty-Second Air Raid.
The raid of last night was the twen
ty-second of the war. The lost Zeppe
lin was the third of her class to como
to grief In these raids.
Details of the attack have not been
published by the authorities. From
unofficial sources It Is learned that
many of the bombs were dropped
either into the sea or in places where
no damage was done.
It was an ideal night for the raid.
"Everything was in favor of tho Zeppe
lins, including tho atmospheric pres
sure and tho lightness of the wind.
The dirigibles came In over the coast
early in the evening and, sailing high,
divided their forces. Those who saw
them say thoy were larger than tho
dirigibles used on previous visits.
They kept at such a height that they
wero out of range of anti-aircraft guns
no iiiov TvisRod inland.
During the evening Zeppelins were
reported at various points. It was
not until after midnight that an
nouncement was made of their depart
ure. ..,,...
Zeppelins at Great Height.
The Zeppelins remained at much
greater heights than during previous
Visits and consequently very few per
sons saw them except when they
were picked out by the British search
Hchts. Their great height also had
the effect of preventing the accurate
selection of their targets and their
bombs dropped Indiscriminately.
Some places were passed over wltn
out being nttacked while in other in
stances a number of bombs fell with
in a melius of a couple hundred yards
information at present at hand indi
cates that the damage done was
chiefly in the smaller towns.
The Zeppelins first made their pres
ence known by dropping bombs snort
lv after 9 o'clock and at some points
the aerial bombardment was still
.
CARRANZA AND OBREGON AT BATTLEFIELD
WHERE LATTER ROUTED VILLA'S FORCES
proceeding at 1:80 o'clock this morn
ing. The identity of the wrecked Zeppe
lin wns disclosed in the .folowing
statement: " "
"Fifty-four explosive and incendiary
bombs were dropped over the eastern
counties and twenty-two over tho
northeast coast. The L-15 was hit
near tho tall by gunfire over the east
ern counties. She dropped off Kent
A machine gun, some ammunition
and a petrol tank were dropped bV
this or another airship."
The pilot of a steamer which was
passing at the time of the surrender
of the Zeppelin which came down in
the Thames estuary, says that the
airship was surrounded by British pa
trol boats. The crow came one by
one, sold the pilot, holding up their
hands as token of surrender.

Germans Bring Up Fresh Troops.
At about 11 o'clock the Germans
brought up a fresh brigade and at
tacked furiously on all aides but were
again thrown back by rifle fire and
bayonets.
At one o'clock another charge was
made. It was directed principally
against the flanks, and the column

what remained of the defending for

of the village but a pile of smoking
ruins.
The Germans remained quiet along
that part of the line during the day,
but made heavy attacks against tho
advanced French positions In the reg

German infantry attacked In mass for
mation and penetrated the first line

London, April 1, 12:50 p. m. Pri

sages from German sources say that
considerable uneasiness prevails In
Holland and that the Dutch military

cancelled. Railway cars which were
placed at the disposal of the military

There have been significant meetings
of those high in command in the army

The question of repairing the curb
