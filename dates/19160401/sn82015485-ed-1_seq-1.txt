now the cow is sold and Mr. ttntft.or

cotton wood rees hauled fn from-the

every evening. I doubt if there is a

Surveyor Harlan was called to Ellis
last week to do some surveying for
the city. When our neighbor coun
ties need any assistance in surveying
they call on Prof. Harlan. He lias

stick him when it comes to figures,

Mr. and Mrs. Fred Cross this week

Sheep and lambs sold 10 lower to

and their appears no reason to expect
much decline but on the contrary
there are reasons for continued
