ULTIMATE TRIUMPH OVER ENE?
MY IS AIM OF ENTENTE
POWERS.
Paris Conference Adopts Resolution
Affirming Unity of Views of Nations
in Matters of Military, Economic
and Diplomatic Relations.
Paris, March 28.?The conference
of the entente allies, which ended to?
day, adopted the following resolutions
just prior to adjournment:
"The representatives of the allied
governments, In conference at Paris,
March 27 and 28, 1916, affirm the
complete community of views and
solidarity of the allies. They confirm
all the measures taken to realize unity
of action or unity of front.
"They understand by that, at the
same time, unity of military action,
assured by the entente concluded be?
tween the general staffs, unity of eco?
nomic action, the organization of
which the present conference have
regulated, and unity of diplomatic
action, which is guaranteed, by their
unshaken will to continue the strug?
gle to victory for the common cause.
"The allied governments declined to
put into practice in the economic do?
main their solidarity of views and
Interests. They charge the economic
conference, which is to be held short?
ly at Paris, to propose for them ap?
propriate measures for the realization
of this solidarity.
"With a view to strengthen, coordi?
nate and unify the diplomatic action
to be exercised to prevent the re
vlctualling of the enemy, the confer?
ence has decided to establish at Paris
a permanent committee in which all
the allies will be represented.
"The conference has decided: First,
to continue the organization already
begun, at London, of an international
central bureau of freight; second, to
proceed in common and with the
briefest delay to seek practical means
to apportion equitably between the
allied nations the charges for mari?
time transportation and check the
rise In freight rates."
The decisions of the conference
have the force of the decisions of the
respective governments because each,
with the exception of Russia, was rep?
resented by its principal ministers and
generals.
. The delegates will leave tonight and
tomorrow in the same silent and un?
obtrusive way that they assembled.
Premier AsquIth and Field Marshal
Earl Kitchener will visit Italy before
returning to London.
tends of Railway Workers' Adjust?
ment Boards Will Act Together To?

New York, March 28.?The 30
chairmen of the division adjustment
boards of the four unions comprising
400,000 locomotive engineers, fire?
men, conductors and trainmen, met
I here today and arranged to present
their demands for an eight hour day
and higher wages to the railroad
managers of the country on Thurs?
day. The railroads will have until
April 29 to consider the demands. If
they refuse them the union delegates
must resubmit the proposition to a
vote of their members in order to
get authority to declare a strike.
SENDS VAUGHN TO ASYLUM.
Former Head of Odd Fellows' Or?
phan Home is Under Observation.
Columbia, March 29.?Thurston U.
Vaughn, uader death sentence for
abuses he has confessed to having
committed upon girls who were in
his care when he was superintendent
of the Odd Fellows' Orphan home at
Greenville, was yesterday removed
from the State penitentiary and com?
mitted to the State Hospital for the
Insane for treatment and for obser?
vation.
Orders providing for the transfer
were issued by Frank B. 'Gary of Ab?
beville, circuit judge, upon the appli?
cation of Proctor A. Bonham, solicitor,
counsel for Vaughan concurring. Last
October Vaughn was taken back to
Greenville to bo resentenced, the su?
preme court having denied his peti?
tion for a new trial, but a stay of
execution was obtained by his at?
torneys, pending an examination as to
his sanity.
Recently a Columbia physician, J.
Heyward Gibbes, M. D., has been |
studying Vaughan's case, by request
of Solicitor Bonham and Gov. Man
nihg. Dr. Glbbcs thought that condi?
tions for a fair and clear determina?
tion would be better at the asylum
and it was on Gov. Manning's sug?
gestion that Judge Gary was asked to
authorize tho transfer.
Dr. Gibbes will treat and observe
the patient at the asylum in coopera?
tion with members of the staff and in
time will report his conclusions.
Writing not Ions ago to Solicitor Bon?
ham he advanced the surmise that
Vauhgan was "malingering," but said
this opinion was subject to revision
under conditions more favorable to
observation.

There were twenty-one bids placed

COUNTY HEALTH SURVEY.
State Beard of Health Will Send Com?
munity Unit to Make Thorough In?
spection of Sumter county.
Dr, J. A. Hayne, Secretary State
Board of Health, has confirmed in a
letter to Secretary Reardon, printed
below, his promise to have a health
survey of Sumter township made at
an early date.
Dr. HaymVs Letter.
State Board of Health of South Caro?
lina,
Columbia, S. C, March 27, lffl6.
E. I. Reardon, Secretary, Chamber of
Commerce, Sumter, s. C.
Dear Sir: Pursuant to our con versa*
tion over 'phone, I am desirous of
sending one of the community units
employed by the State Board of
Health, to Sumter to do intensive
community work. The purpose of
tho spread of typhoid fever, ''''hiowFT
worm disease, tuberculosis, dlarrhoe
al diseases, etc.
The plan pursued is to send one di?
rector, a physician skilled in this
work, and three health inspectors.
They will remain in a county for
three months and visit every home
in the community in which they work,
and by personal conversation, bulle?
tins and illustrated lectures at tho
school house, strive to drive home tho
lessons of modern sanitation.
The ultimate object of this work
13 to educate a county to the necessi?
ty of employing a whole-time county
' health officer who will, carry on the
work begun by these units.
So far, there are only two counties
in South Carolina which have whole
time health officers: viz, Greenville
and Rlchland counties.
I am enclosing herewith copy of
Bill, passed by the last General As?
sembly, for county health officer for
Greenville county. I believe that
such a Bill passed for a whole-time
health officer for Sumter county,
would pay many times over the coat
cf such an officer, both In improving
the health conditions In Sumter coun?
ty and in advertising Sumter city and
i county, as a progressive city in a pro?
gressive county, and 1 believe that
your Chamber of Commerce could
take up no better advertising cam?
paign for the city and county than a
propaganda for a whole-time county
health officer. Yours truly,
(Signed) James A. Hayne,
Secretary State Board of Health,
Chairman J. A. McKnlght of the
local board of health Informed Sec?
retary Reardon that he approves of
the proposed township health survey,
and believed that the Sumter health
board would request that the city of
Sumter be included in this survey by
the State Board of Health unit. How?
ever, no regular action has been tak?
en as yet by the local health board.
The Sumter Chamber of Commerce is
working for a whole-time county
health officer, and cooperating with
Sumter health board and health offi?
cer for the best possible sanitary con?
ditions in this city.
