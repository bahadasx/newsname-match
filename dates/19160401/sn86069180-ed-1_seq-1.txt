INTOLERANCE
Father O'llcrn Discusses Tills
Topic in Evening Lecture
at Buffalo.
Justice and Lovo Are Two First
Duties of Man to Ills
Fellows.
Never lias Catholic Public En
couraged Either Hatred or
Suspicion.
PROUDLY POINT TO THE PAST
Rev. Thomas J.- O'Hem, Buffalo
Apostolate, spoke as follows at the
Teck Theater Sunday evening, his
subject being "Intolerance:" "Tol
erance may be described as an In
dulgence or forbearance shown to
ward persons, principles and opin
ions which one holds very sacred
and intensely dear. Intolerance, on
tho other hand, Is an uncompromis
ing attitude, unyielding, Inflexible,
severe toward all persons, princi
ples and opinions differing from
those one cherishes or subscribes to
oneself. Too often It Is a refusal
of all charity and lenience to oth
ers who may happen not to bo In
accord with our views and our
Judgment. Justice and love are tho
two first duties of a man to his fel
low men. Tolerance Is nowhere
mentioned in tho law. Mere toler
ance does not go far enough. Tho
Catholic church does not merely
tolerate those outside her fold; sho
loves them with a divine charity
and that is more than tolerance.
"There are forms of intolerance
not only justifiable, but necessary
as well. No one who esteems virtue,
could be tolerant of vice. Wo must
here make another distinction. It
Is one thing to abhor vice -and
quite another to hate the vicious.
Catholics are not Intolerant of -tho-erring,
but toward their error there
can bo no such thing as tolerance.
If a man says that black Is white
or that two and two make five, wo
may pity him, but we do not say,
'My good sir, you may bo quite
right, your opinion is as good as
mine.' Truth is intolerant of error.
Tho Catholic church claims to bo a
teacher of truth. She claims a di
vine commission to teach only what
is true. Any tchihxh- .within claims
to teach tho truth can not throw
the mantel of false charity over all
the vagaries of opinion within its
pale. If this is intolerance, tho
Catholic church must plead guilty,
for she claims to be tho messenger
to mankind of the whole truth of
God.
"Did Christ ever accommodate
his teachings to the whim or
prejudices of his hearers? Consider
that scene In tho desert when He
was teaching tho necessity of tho
reception of tho heavenly food
which He would give them. 'Ex
cept you eat tho flesh of tho Son
of Man and drink his blood, you
shall not have life In you.' Many
of his followers objected to this
part of his teaching, and they
walked not more with Him. Now if
Ho had been tolerant Ho would
mve said to them: 'I am sorry that
you can not accept this part of my
teaching. But do not go away; it
would bo intolerant to oblige you
to accept that which you do not
like.' Tho line of conduct which
Ho followed Himself Ho prescribed
with even greater strictness for his
representatives. 'Whosoever,' Ho
said to them, 'shall not receive you
nor hear your words, going forth
from that house or city, shake off
tho dust from your feet. Amon I
say to you, It shall be more toler
ablo for the land of Sodom and
Gomorrah in tho day of judgment
than for that city.' For tho rejec
tion of his doctrine, made known
by their word, there was to bo no
toleration. It Is not my purpose
to explain or apologize for condi
tions in other countries in ages
past. Wo regret tho severity and
persecutions of the past and thank
God that they have passed away
forever. To understand them wo
must put ourselves In the place of
tho people of the time. Heresy was
a crime that tho State considered
worso than treason and punished
with death. Tho reformers did not
hold different views. Rousseau de
clared: 'The reformation was intol
erant from its cradle, and its auth
ors universal persecutors.' Tho his
torian Hallam bears tho same testi
mony: 'Persecution Is the deadly
original sin of tho reformed
churches, which cools overy honest
man's zeal for their cause, in pro
portion as his reading becomes
moro extensive.'
"Having In view tho history of
our own country, vo can say with
out fear or contradltion that the
Catholic is the most tolerant of
American citizens. Never once
from tho colonization of this fair
land to the present day havo Cath
olics given an example of intoler
ance toward those not of thoir
faith. It was a Catholic, George
Calvert, tho first Lord Baltimore,
who first conceived the idea of es
tablishing a colony where ovoryone
might worship God according to the
dictates of his own conscience. Ho
became the pioneer of religious tol
eration. His son and successor fol
lowed in the footsteps of his father
and established on tho shores of
Maryland the first government in
modern times where all men might
worship God unmolested by intoler
ance. The principle of religious
toleration embodied In the constitu
tion is the self-same which guided
the Maryland Catholic one and one
half centuries earlier. That prin
ciple hag never been violated by
the Catholics of this land. Nker
hava they been guilty of exciting
religious animosities. Never has a
Catholic Bishop used the pulpit to
Inflame the dying embers of relig
ious bigotry. Never has the Cath
olic public encouraged hatred and
suspicion of their fellows by sup
porting magazines and newspapers
rlfo with misrepresentation and
calumny. Toward Knownothlng
Ism and A. P. Alsm of every form
they have presented a 'manly atti
tude of determined courage, and
when these un-American and un
christian attempts to stir up strife
have died away no effort has been
made by Catholics for retaliation
or revenge. What will be the at
titude of Catholics in the future?
Wo proudly point to the past. The
Catholics of America can bo rolled
upon to maintain the principles
first proclaimed by Lord Baltimore)
and afterward embodied In the con
stitution of the United States."
APPROVE THK CILNflE.
Division 1, A. 0. H., held its reg
ular meeting on Thursday night of
last week and It was tho largest and
most encouraging assembly of Hiber
nians that had met in Llcdcrkranz
Hall for months. President Mark
Ryan occupied tho chair, with all the
officers present and seemingly de
lighted with tho grand turnout of
numbers of old Division 1. Minutes
cf tho preceding meeting, wherein it
was decided to meet only on tho
fourth Thursday of each month until
further notice, were well received
and given unanimous approval. Dan
O'Keefe, Secretary of tho County
Board, was a visitor and spoko In
glowing terms of tho St. Patrick's
day entertainment and the pleasing
results, 11 of which was a source of
great satisfaction to Division 4, un
der whose auspices' the celebration
took plado. President Ryan ex

thus gave all present ample time to
speak for the good of tho order. The
veteran Hibernian, Hon John Ryan,

GREAT Y. M. I. BOOM.
Grand President Robert T. Burke,
of this city, and Secretary Francis J,
Carroll, of Brazil, Ind., have been
doing some strenuous work in Chi
cago for tho Young Men's Institute,
where they expect to place at least
six now councils before the end of
tho year. They havo been In con
ference with priests and laymen of
the Windy City and received every
possible encouragement, and have
reason to believe they will have the
earnest support of Archbishop Mun
dcleln. Rev. Father Murphy Is tak
ing active Interest In this movement,
which would prov!d6 for Catholic
boys and young men an organization
similar to tho Y. M. C. A. for Prot
estant youth. Tho Y. M. I. has a
firm foundation and provides what
has been long needed. It wouHd bring
the Catholic boys into ono strong
society whero their wants would be
provided for and their moral charac
ter .safeguarded. For yeara tho
Kentucky Irish American has advo
cated more general recognition of
the Y. M. I., the best young mtm's
society In this country.

PASSIONTIDE
The Time Set For Preparation
For the Great Enster
Festival.
Opens With Fiftli Sunday of Lent
and Has Its Peculiar
Features.
Church Expresses the Grief That
Should Now Fill All
) Hearts.
HONORED FORMULAS REMAIN
Tho end of tho Lenten season is
fast approaching. Next Sunday
week, April 9, is Passion Sunday.
Tho two weeks immediately prpced
iflg Eas'ter have lfeeh'rset apiut as
a more special preparation for the
great festival and havo received
the general appelation of Passion
tide. Although the second week is dis
tinguished by its particularly im
pressive rites, yet that which opens
with the fifth Sunday of Lent, com
monly known as Passion Sunday,
has also Its peculiar features. All
through Lent the altar has been
draped in purple and denuded of
its floral decorations, unless some
saint's feast called for more joyful
surroundings. During Passiontide
the gloom of the sanctuary is to
deepen. From the first' vespers of
Sunday tho crucifix, which has
hitherto formed tho prominent feat
ure of every altar, Is to disappear
from view. Tho gospel of tho Sun
day related that terrible scene in
the Templo of Jerusalem, when an
Infuriated peoplo hardened against
their Redeemer, not content with
blaspheming Him as a samarltan
nnd demoniac, actually tried to
stone Him to deatn. But Jesus hid
himself, says tho gospel.
In remembrance of his humilia
tion of tho Son of God withdrawing
from the gaze of men till the time
should como for tho carrying out of
his work of redemption the church
veils the crucifix until Good Friday.
The Images of tho saints likewise
disappear, that tho glory of the
servants may be hidden when that
of the Master Is eclipsed. Through
out this mournful time the church
suppresses the "Gloria Patrl" in
many portions of her public offices.
By this sho would express the grief
which should fill all hearts at the
contemplation of the sufferings of
Christ and render such songs of
joy distasteful. For tho three last
days of Holy Week this sacred
formula will bo entirely hushed, and
tho church would gradually attune
the minds of her children to tho
spirit which ought then to possess
them.
It will help toward tho under
standing of various portions of the
liturgy during Passiontide If we
bear in mind the other objects
which tho church of the early ages
had in view in subordination to the
one great subject of contemplation.
These were tho preparation of
catechumens for baptism on Holy
Saturday and reconciliation of pub
lic penitents on Maundy Thursday.
The various formulas of the lit
urgy, when not referring directly
to the Passion, will be found to
touch upon ono or other of these
subjects.
Although the discipline of tho
church had undergono no change
with regard to both catechumens
and penitents, still the so time-honored
formulas have been allowed to
remain, as affording matter for
mediation to tho church's children,
who though washed from sin In the
waters of baptism have yet need
of penance for further offences.
CATHOLIC PROtfttESS.
One Christian out of 300 pagans
Is the proportion today in most of
China, and we recall that only ten
years ago tho figures were one out
of 400. Peking has made a record
nothing short of marvellous during
the past year. The Procurator of
that mission, Father Planchet, a
Vincentian, writing to the American
Foreign Mission Seminary at Mary
knoll, states that his mission reg
istered 3S,2fJ0 adult baptisms

TWO POINTS TO BE EMPHASIZED
The tendency of governmental
agencies to favor the public schools
in various ways, particularly in the
education ef-4thei-lmmigraat,ha8
been"' pointed outT ronf" "time- ' to
time. That this partial attitude
is deserving of condemnation has
also been emphatically declared.
The Buieau of Education of the
Departmetn of the Interior has been
particularly conspicuous in Its of
fences In this regard, and wo now
note that the Bureau of Naturaliza
tion of tho Department of Labor is
doing the same thing. In the March
report of Labor Statistics of that
department wo read:
"About a year ago the Bureau of
Naturalization, after consultation
with various school authorities,
worked' out a comprehensho plan
for the education of candidates for
citizenship. Under this plan tho
bureau arranges to send to tho
public school authorities a state
ment showing the namo, address
and nationality of each alien resi
dent who has declared his intention
to becomo a citizen or of each peti
tioner to be naturalized. At tho
samo time it advises the declarant
or petitioner of its action and of the
public school advantages. It then
lests with tho school authorities to
encourago tho prospective citizens
to enroll in the schools and, if nec
essary, to establish special schools
for their accommodation."
This is indeed Interesting; but
further facts reveal tho real situa
tion oven tho moro clearly. "During
the year 1915 tho Bureau of Natur
alization received approximately
350,000 applications for citlzon
shlp." About 150,000 of these men
wero married, 122,000 names were
sent to the Bureau "to the various
public schools of the communities
whero tho various residents re
sided." "The public schools," it is
pointed out, "have shown an earnest
spirit of co-operation. With tho
opening of the present scholastic
year fifty cities and towns were co
operating. At the end of December
this number had grown to 450 and
by the end of January to 566 cities
and towns, representing forty-four
States. Hundreds of other locali
ties have expressed their interest,
but have been deterred from co-operation
by local conditions which
render such work impracticable." It
is interesting to add that In Aug
ust, 1915, tho Bureau of Naturaliza
tion sont out a news letter in which
tho following statement was made:
"Tho Bureau of Naturalization
has extended its efforts throughout
tho United States and brought its
educational movement to tho atten
tion of all Superintendents of pub
lic schools wherever there Is any
foreign population for tho purposo
of enlisting these educators in car
rying forward this movement. Por
sonal letters havo been addressed to
tho Superihtendents of schools of
the cities and count!e3 In each
Stato, bringing to their attention
this great activity, in an effort to
stimulate interest In this work in
every locality whero foreigners re
side. The bureau has also dis
cussed its plan personally with the
Superintendents of schools and
Presidents of boards of education
in the various Eastern cities and
they have agreed unanimously to
end their support in opening the
doors of the public schools for the
Instruction of tho foreigners where
there are no schools in existence,
and to extend the activities of the
schools established for this purpose
so as Io meet with the desires of
the Bureau of Naturalization."
So the whole matter is revealed.
The bureau has been systematically
encouraging tho education of tho
Immigrant In the public schools to
the exclusion of tho parochial and
other schools of tho country. Why
was not tho samo Information
tho names of prospective citizens
given to them also? It may be
said that tho parochial schools have
not taken up this matter to a great
degree, but this does not proporly
answer tho question, for It is to be
expressly noted that the bureau's
AffnrtR worn Infnnrlnrl tn fnrlunn Vm
'public school authorities to "estab
lish special schools for their (the
immigrants') 'accommodations."
There aro two points to bo em
phasized In this regard. Ono of
them Is that our Catholic societies
should make a special effort to ren
der it possible for our parochial
schools to take tip this work of Im
migrant training for citizenship.
With their heavy burdens now, this
added work would be certainly most
onerous. A great per cent, of tho
newly arrived Immigrants are of our
faith and must bo cared for by us.
The societies should discover means
of co-operation with tho parochial
schools for the maintenance of this
activity. At tho same time and
this is the second point we must
continue to emphatically object to
tho favoritism shown by our Gov
ernment bureaus to tho public
schools. If information is to bo dis
pensed on educational subjects, it
should be dispensed to all alike. It
Is to be hoped that the various de
partments will soon perceive tho
wisdom of such a course of action.
C. B. of C. V.
APRIL INTENTION.
The general Intention for April
recommended by His Holiness Popo
Benedict XV. Is tho widows and
orphans of tho war. Tho saddest
victims of tho almost world-wide
war that has been raging for over
eighteen months aro tho widows and
orphans whom tho bullet or tho
bayonet or the shrapnel has robbed
of their natural protectors and sup
port Hundreds of thousands of un
fortunate women and children have
been driven from their homes to
languish in foreign lands, depend
ent on the charity of strangers. Tho
little ones cried for bread and there
wero none to share it with them.
A first object of our prayers
for them must bo that God will
touch tho hearts of those whose
means will allow them to feed tho
hungry and to clothe the naked.
Their appeal for help must not bo
made in vain. Let us not forget to
pray that proper provision may be
made to safeguard tho faith of those
Catholic children who may bo car
ried to lands where our holy re
ligion is often an object of hatred
and bitter opposition. Sadder fat
than the death of their fathors
would be the loss "of their Catholic
faith.

FURTHER OUTRAGE.
A telegram from Mexico City,
mado public by the Mexican Con
sultate at San Antonio, Texas, last
Saturday, states that tho Governor
of Sonora has Issued an order ex
pelling all priests.
The Associated Press reports that
tho published announcement that
tho Mexican Government is consider
ing tho advisability of taking over
all tho personal and realty holdings
of tho Catholic clergy throughout
tho republic created somewhat of a
sensation in Moxico City on Monday.
In a special dispatch from Querre
taro. El Domocrata, tho official Gov
ernment organ, quotes both Secre
tary of tho Treasury Cabrera and
Dr. Slurob, Governor of tho State of
Guanajuato, as saying that the
measure would bo mado offectivo un
der the old law dating back moro
than half a century, whon church
edifices wero seized during the ad
ministration of Benito Juarez.
Tho clergy In tho States of
MIchoacan, Puebla, Quorotaro and
Jalisco aro reputed to bo immensely
wealthy in jewels, lands and works
of art which are held In trust for
tho church. It is said that tho ap
propriation of these by the Govern
ment for conversion into gold with
which to swell tho reserve to bo ac
cumulated for tho redemption of the
paper money lssuo mado necessary
by the revolution, would solvo Mex
ico's present economic difficulties.

place tho present paper issue at
500,000,000 pesos with an insignifi
cant metallic reserve for its redemp
tion. THINKS nE'S OLDEST.

A REVIEW OF THE 1914 BETRAYAL
Day by day Democrats aro be
coming more enthused over tho
outlook from a national standpoint,
while on tho other hand the Repub
licans are becoming much discour
aged over the prospects of tho G.
O. P. Strange to Bay, both owo
their piesent feeling to the actions
of ono man. The Democrats aro
satisfied that Rooscvolt, If not given
the nomination by tho Republican
and Progressive conventions at Chi
cago on June 7, intends to see that
tho one who receives It will llvo
to rue the day. The Republican
leaders havo begun to turn to Jus
tice Hughes, not because they really
want him, but because they think
ho would be aceptable to the Bull
Moosers. From the standpoint of
Republican leaders like Barnes,
Penrose, etc., they rate Hughes and
Rosevelt as tho two lowest of their
personal choices, Hughes because
thoy don't think they can use him
If elected, and If tho Rough Rider
should beat them In the convention
they would take tho greatest pleas
ure in knifing him in tho general
election. In a conference this past
week at the homo of his son-ln-law,
Dr. Richard Derby, in Now
York, Roosevelt announced that ho
would lead the fight against tho
Wilson administration, If tho people
showed they wanted him and wero
willing to back up his policies.
Those in the conference who wero
former Progressive leaders con
vinced him (which was easy) that
the people wore demanding him to
lead the fight.
If Roosevelt could have been
eliminated or his withdrawal an
nouncement secured the Republican
leaders would havo tendered the
nomination to McCall, Burton or
Cummins, and at this late date if
Hughes refuses to allow his namo
used McCall will be selected as tho
man to beat Roosevelt. But this
much can be taken for granted
Hughes, McCall or no ono else is ac
ceptable to our ex-President and ho
will only support ono candidate In
tho Republican or Progressive con
ventions, and that man is Roose
velt. Tho nomination given to an
other wlll'llnd him playing tho dog
in the manger policy and tho raco
of 1912 will bo enacted again, Wil
son opposed by a divided Republi
can narty. Another ruature pioas-
ing to the Democrats Is that Hughes
Is losing ground daily, principally
because of his SDhtnx-liKe attitude
on tho questions of tho day, and
his nomination will drive tho German-American
vote Into the Wilson
camp as is predicted in tho follow
ing, taken from tho Fatherland:
"It Is admitted mat u no canui-
date develops strength enough to
get tho nomination on tho first or
second ballot, Justice Jtiugnes wm
be the nominee. In this calculation
the 3,000,000 Gorman-American
voters are complacontly Ignored.
They aro to havo no voice in tho
councils of that party. If they
don't Uko Hughes thoy can vote for
Wilson." Thus tho Gorman-American
vote, which is 80 per cent, lie
publican, will support Wilson In
preference to Roosevelt or Hughes.
Turning to Stato politics, tho
fight for control in tho coming
State Democratic convention Is a
timely topic, as it Is an effort of
Haly and Beckham to stage a come
back in tho political arena, their
move to make Rufus VanBant, of
Ashland, Stato Chairman, to bo a
test of their strength. Against
them will be pitted Gov. Stanley
and Senator Ollto aJmes. Against
Mr. Vansant tho average Democrat
can say no word, but support of
Haly and Beckham Is impossible.
In 1914, after a bitter primary, tho
Stanley and McCreary supporters
rallied to Beckham in his raco for
United States Senator, although ho
was a bitter pill to swallow and his
Republican opponent, ex-Gov. Will
son, was well thought of by many
Democrats. Hero In Louisville,
Wlllson's home town, tho Demo
cratic organization scored a splendid
victory for Beckham, over one-third
of his majority bolng registered in
this district. On tho night of the
election Beckham said in tho pres
ence of the writer: "I don't know
how I ever can repay Louisville for
Its showing today." In addition he
expressed his gratitude to one of tho.

tificate of election when, like a
thunderbolt from tho sky, camo the
announcement that McChesney on a
prohibition platform was tho pro
gramme for Haly and Beckham.

to espouse tho Haly-Beckhara slate
for tho coming Stato convention,
and above all, not the Louisville
Democracy, who 'wore openly and
shamefully betrayed by these politi
cal buccaneers.
