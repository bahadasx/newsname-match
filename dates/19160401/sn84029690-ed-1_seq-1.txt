During this period the water commis
sioner inspected 61 sewer connections,
made 26 taps for water consumers besides
the other and various duties that came
under his supervision. The City Clerk
was also acting assistant water commis
sioner. His duties were to read meters and
collect water rentals- For this service he
was allowed $35.00 per month, so that the
combined salaries of the water cornmis
siones and assistant-equaled that paid the
former commissioner. This arrangement
proved very efficient and allowed us to keep
an accurate record of meter readings in a
record kept for that purpose, and facilitat
ed the collection of water centals.
SEWER
"This service is destined to be" a source of
considerable expense to the City from the
fact that the septic tank is filled to over
flowing and for five years no attempt had
been made to pump it until last fall when,
about 52 feet was pumped leaving the
solids which cannot be moved. Grant
Hornady, the sewer contractor writes me
in reply to my letter as follows: The expect-
, ed has happened, I warned you people at
th time that unless the tank was pumped
once a year or 18 months at the most it
would give you trouble. Now I see no
way out except to inject a large quantity
of water at high pressure and possibly it
may be pumped. That failing, it must
be bailed out by hand. Therefore, I be
lieve our entire sewer system is manaced
bv this neglect.

" Does Osteopathy Cure?
It is a very common thing to hear
someone say, ies, usteopathy-relieves
while taking treatment, but it
does not cure. You are as bad as ever
soon after discontinuing treatment."
The reason for this statement is this:
These cases are of the chronic variety
and have tried every conceivable reme
dy, and many of them resorted to sur
gery, and getting no relief they at la3t
turn to osteopathy . lney take a month,
perhaps two months treatment, they
feel much better and against the advice
of their osteopathic physician they stop
treatment. Ui course the old trouble
returns because they have not contin
ued long enough to get at the founda
tion af the disease. !
Is it fair to the Osteopathic to expect
him to remove in a few days - or weeks
a disorder or illness that has been under
the care and advice of the other schools
of medicine for perhaps years and
years with no results other than occas
sional relief for briet penocs: Many
cases have grown steadily worse with
no relief whatsoever. No one will de
ny that in a large measure this is the
class of patients the Osteopath gets,
and because of the fact that they have
tried so many remedies and doctors,
honest and otherwise, these people ex
pect only one more failure and one
more bunch of hard earned cash gone.
Consequently the Osteopath has more
than the disease to overcome. The
very hardest task the doctor of Osteo- j
pathy has before him is to get these
long standing cases to stay with him
for a period of time sufficient to give
him a chance to romove the cause.
Osteopathy can and does cure from
sixty to seventy-five per cent of chronic
ailments, and greatly benefits the rest
of them. This statement i3 based on
the experience of Osteopathic physi
cians eighty per cent of whose cases
are the incurables, discards, or rather
the failure of others of the medical pro
fession. This being true and consider
ing the frame of mind and condition of
pocket-book, it is no wonder that many
qnit before they have given the Osteo
path a fair trial.
Osteopathy ia new to many, and hav
ing been taught before the dawn of
history, and very persistently since, to
swallow something when they have a
pain, people, cannot readily forsake
tradition and take up with , so simple
ana understandable an idea aa that all
abnormal conditions or diseases origi
nate from some disorder within the
body itself,

Feed Oat Your Hog Six Wctki Earlier.
In every lot of hogs on feed two or
three weeks quickly and actually eat
less than others. If all would fatten
like these, the entire drove would be
ready for the market six weeks earlier
and to save six weeks feed is an item
that you fully understand.
The hog that fattens easily must be
in prime physical condition. The B. A.
Thomas Hog Powder is a conditioner
for hogs. It keeps their system clean
and healthy and enables them to fatten
quickly without falling a prey to the
usual diseases of hogs. The B A.
Thomss Hog Powder is not stock food.
It's straight medicine, and we took the
agency because it enables jou to feed
