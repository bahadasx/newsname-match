York Hotel Made Over to Represent
Military Reservation on the Hudson.
New York.From the Atlantic to the
Pacific West Pointers recently celebrat
ed the one hundred and fourteenth an
niversary of the founding of the Mili
tary academy at West Point. In New
York more than 300 dined at the Hotel
Astor, as many more dined in San
Francisco, while about 200 sat about
the tables in Chicago. In lesser num
bers the sons of the Point gathered In
St Louis, in New Orleans, in Galves
ton, in San Antonio, while in far away
Honolulu and Manila other hundreds
assembled and sang the anthem "Hail,
Alma Mater, Dear," and yelled the fa
mous "Rah! rah! rah!" of the "armay."
Through the courtesy of the Ameri
can Telephone company the diners in
New York, Chicago and San Francisco
were linked together, and in the course
of the evening generals and colonels
and majors and captains and lieuten
ants exchanged greetings and cracked
jokes at one another's expense across
the continent. For instance, Colonel

sympathized with his old cadet chum
Holabird in Chicago because of the
latter's thinning locks, while Holabird
retorted by asking the South Carolina
colonel why it was that his forty odd
summers did not make him "less noisy
than was tbe case when you were the
noisiest youngster at West Point."
Major General J. Franklin Bell, com
manding the western department of
the army, with headquarters in San
Trancisco. who wus the ranking offi
cer at the Pacific coast function, talked
with Colonel J. C. F. Tillson in New
York and was surprised to learn that
the colonel was not one of the "lucky
chaps" chasing Villa. Had the United
States kept Vera Cruz and had Freder
ick Funston remained in command
there, General Bell, who was relieved
a year ago of the border command by
the little Kansan, would probably be
directing operations from San Antonio.
Brigadier General E. C. Young, who
was also in San Francisco, asked Colo
nel W. H. Hart, who dined in New
York, some very personal questions,
while General Charles King, the fa
mous army novelist, who dined with
the crowd in Chicago, was overheard
by the New Yorkers to tell Colonel W.
H. Hunter, who was in Chicago, that
he might write a story based on the
pursuit of Pancho Villa. Lieutenant
Phil Mathews of Fort Totten also got
a word in and told Lieutenant A. J.
Davis, who was in San Francisco, that
West Point was sure to beat Annapolis
again next fall.
The grand ballroom of the Hotel As
tor, In which the New York dinner was
served, was made over to represent
West Point
Among those at the dinner were Colo

COWS WEAR DRESSES.
Made of Hemp Cloth to Protect Them
From the Cold.
San Francisco. An authority on
dress and its cut for dairy cows is a
guest at the St. Francis, in the person
of Sir Francis Webster of Glasgow, a
wealthy manufacturer of hemp goods
In Scotland and the owner of a stock
range in Texas embracing 1,500,000
acres and thousands of head of stock.
Sir Francis' cows are dressed regu
larly every winter in suits of hemp
cloth made at his own manufacturing
establishment, to protect them from
the cold and snow, minimize the dan
gers from tuberculosis and increase
their daily yield of milk.
Each cow has two suits a week.
They are not elaborate dress affairs
by any means, with lingerie and all
that It is a man made dress of one
piece, or simply a coverall blanket that
fits loosely.
This, of course, means added ex
pense, but the yield of milk during the
cold weather is about 27 per cent
.larger than from cows not similarly
protected.
OLD INDIAN LEAVES HOSPITAL
Chief, Over 100, Was More Comfort
able on Floor Than In Cot.
Cass Lake. Minn.Captain John
Smith, the aged Chippewa Indian
chief, a well know* character in this
portion of Minnesota, who was struck
and badly Injured by a Great Northern
locomotive in the yards here recently,
has left the hospital and gone to the
home of a son.
The venerable Indian, reputed to be
117 years old, making him by far the
oldest man in Minnesota, If not in the
United States, grew better from the
very day he was carried in an uncon
scious condition to the hospital.
As soon as he collected his senses he
declined to remain on a hospital cot
and made the nurse fix up a bed for
him on a blanket on thefloor,where he
found contentment. He also called for
his pipe and tobacco and, because of
his age, was humored. He smoked
constantly and rapidly grew better, as
it developed that while he had been
bruised and shocked, he had not been
seriously injured.
ATTRIBUTES HER LONG
LIFE TO SWEET DIET
Woman, Ninety, Begins Meals
With Dessert.
Melrose, Mass. Mrs. James Bodie
celebrated her ninetieth birthday an
niversary several days ago. She is in
excellent health and attributes this
fact to an astonishing diet that con
sists largely of chocolates, puddings,
fruits and other sweetmeats.
Mrs. Rodie was personally conduct
ing the frying of a batch of five dozen
doughnuts when the reporter called at
her home. While In conversation with
him she ate several hot doughnuts, and
upon being asked if she was troubled
with indigestion she replied that she
had relished dainty foods more in her
old age than when she was young.
She is known as the "spry old lady
of Melrose," and every morning during
good weather she takes a walk of two
miles or more just for a "little exer-
cise," as she terms It. Mrs. Rodie is a
zealous worker and exhibited for the
reporter's benefit over twenty-five fan
cy woven knit table pieces that she had
completed since last fall. She also as
sists her daughter-in-law, with whom
she lives, in the general housework,
and twice a week she dusts all the fur
niture in the house.
Mrs. Rodie has an excellent appetite.
Every morning she has cake and cof
fee for breakfast, sometimes eating a
little oatmeal. Her daughter-in-law
told the reporter that Mrs. Rodie al
ways eats her dessert first and that If
she is hungry she will eat a little meat
She eats on the average a box of choc
olates a week.
Mrs. Rodie is a fresh air enthusiast
and has not slept In a room with any
of the windows closed for over sixty
years. She Is also a firm follower of
the "early to bed and early to rise"
rule, for she retires every evening at 7
o'clock and is up bright and early at 6
o'cloek the next morning.
PROPOSE MARRIAGE TRUST.
Indiana Juetieee of the Peace May Qet
Together Upon Ceremonies.
Jeffersonville, Ind.Some of the six
justices of the peace of Jefferson, who
fight among themselves for "marriage
couples," are proposing a combination
whereby all six would establish cen
tral marrying parlors and would pool
and divide equally all their earnings.
The chief benefit would be the elim
ination of the "runners," with whom
the justices now split their fees, which
only in exceptional cases amount to
more than $3. One result of the com
petition has been the cutting of fees.
Many eloping couples now get married
for $1. Secret weddings generally cost
the elopers a little more, and a twenty
five dollar fee shows up once In awhile.
Sends Wilson 60 Cente For a DJvorce.
Washington. President Wilson re
ceived a plea from a citizen of Georgia
asking for a divorce. A money order
for 0 cents as a fee or for expenses
was inclosed in the letter. The Geor
gian explained that he had been desert
ed by his wife. "We did not fall out,"
he wrote "she stepped out."
TAMES WILD DUCKS.
Madison (Wis.) Resident Has a Floek
of Nearly 200 of Them.
Madison, Wis.Wild ducks may be
domesticated and raised on the farm
as well as tame ones. The plan has
been tried by J. C. Halpin of this city
for the past three years with success.
Last fall he had a flock of nearly 200,
and when the cold weather came dh^
they took their regular "spin" in the
skies and then returned to the yards.
The wild duck sells for more than the
tame variety because of the flavor of
the meat.
The first birds were kept in captivity
by clipping the wings, but the young
ducks are as easily handled as domes-'
tic ones.
These domesticated mallards retain
many of the instincts peculiar to wild
nature. Let one mallard start limping
and in less than ten minutes, unless
something is done to attract attention
elsewhere, a majority will be limping.
TWINS AND BURGLARS.
Latter Left When They Found the
Stork Had Come to the House.
Kansas City, Mo.Because the stork
and burglars selected the same time to
visit M. H. Brotherson of No. 644 Ohio
avenue, Kansas side, the burglars had
to withdraw and postpone their visit.
The stork left twin boys. Mr. Brother
son now is the father of six children.
Mr. Brotherson hastened to his store
next door to summon a doctor at 5
a. m. He hurried in, picked up the
telephone, and as he jiggled the receiv
er nervously he heard a noise in the
rear of the store.
"Come quick!" he said over the wire.
The noise increased, and something
fell. He stepped out the front door,
quickly locked it and hurried home.
The twins having arrived safe and
sound and tbe excitement abated, he
went back to the store. The back door
was open, some sacks gone and a pile
of boxes overturned.
WILL TRY TO ABOLISH
OFFICE IF HE GETS IT
Platform of Alabama Man Who
Seeks Election.
Birmingham, Ala.Dr. John S. Gil
lespie, who was court clerk in this
county for twenty years, is out as can
didate for county treasurer, announc
ing as the chief plank in his plat
form conviction of the uselessness of
the office and declaring his purpose to
do everything in his power for its
abolishment. It is the first time in the
history of the country, so far as known
here, that a candidate for public office
has run on a platform to abolish it.
Mrs. Floribel Brown Ohme, one of
the best known educators in the state,
is a candidate for membership on the
Jefferson county board of education.
She is the first woman in the south,
so far as known here, to become a can
didate for an elective public office.
Women cannot vote in this state. She
is relying on the men to elect her, and
her prospects for success are generally
regarded as highly favorable.
James A. Mitchell, a prominent law
yer of Birmingham, recently published
an article severely criticising the state
supreme court for its ruling on a case
he had conducted before that tribunal,
and strongly intimated that the court
was unduly influenced. For this he
was cited to appear before the court
and show why his license to practice
before it should not be canceled. He
answered this summons by announcing
himself a candidate for chief justice
of the supreme court, which is filled
in this state by popular election.

MLITARYTRAINING
FOR SCHOOLBOYS
Youngest ArmyEver Called Mo
bilized In New York.
OFFICERS TALK TO YOUTHS
Preparations Being Made by Associa
tion to Accommodate 15.000 Boys at
a Camp During the SummerMany
Prominent Men Have Their Sons En-
rolledGeneral Wood Co-operatee.
New York.The youngest army ever
called together was mobilized recently.
One thousand New York schoolboys,
aged twelve and up, met at national
guard armories in Manhattan and
Brooklyn to enroll for the big summer
camp which is being organized by the
National School Camp association of
1 Broadway.
The regiment which answered the
call to the colors is but the first group
of what is expected to be the largest
schoolboy organization in the city.
Preparations are being made by the
association to accommodate as many
as 15,000 boys at the camp during the
summer.
The meetings were held with the ap
proval and co-operation of Major Gen
eral Leonard Wood, who detailed of
fleers under his command to be present
at the armories and talk to the boys
enlisting.
The largest and most enthusiastic
meeting was held at the Twenty-third
Infantry Regiment armory on Bedford
avenue, Brooklyn. Fully 600 boys en
rolled, and cheered Captain T. E. Mur
phy of Fort Wadsworth, who spoke to
them. The officer told them of the ad
vantages of preparedness. He nar
rated the military history of the coun
try, giving examples of how heavy a
price was paid for lack of prepared
ness.
Many prominent men attended the
meeting to enroll their sons. Colonel
Chamberlain of General Wood's staff
brought his boy to stand in line with
the sons of Colonel Mitcham, also of
General Wood's staff, and of Lieuten
ant Commander Jessup of the Brook
lyn navy yard.
A number of the faculty of the
Brooklyn Polytechnic institute also
was present There is a plan under
way to organize a battalion in the in
stitute to attend the camp.
The idea of a great camp within
trolley distance of New York has prov
ed a most popular one. Hundreds of
boys have had their applications filed
a considerable time, while hundreds of
parents have also* written the associa
tion asking permission to enroll their
boys.
The camp will probably be located
on Staten Island, though the site has
not yet been definitely picked. It will
be a gunless camp but, aside from
this detail, the work will follow close
ly that done in grownups' organiza
tions. Any boy over twelve in public
school, high school or college is eligi
ble to join. It is expected that a corps
will be formed of medical students,
who will have a splendid opportunity
to study the important subject of camp
sanitation.
The camp will open July 1 and will
be held for two months. Boys may re
main there from two weeks to the en
tire two months if they choose. The
entire cost to each boy will be about
20 cents a day. Each young soldier
will have to supply his own uniform,
which will be similar to that of the
boy scouts.
The incipient soldiers will be put
through a stiff course of training in
general field work, open order work
and the other regulation army drills.
In the meantime, before the camp is
opened, the enrolled members of the
camp will drill several days every
week in the city armories.

SAY HIDDEN GOLD IS MYTH.
California Travelers Find No Treasure
In Patagonia.
San Francisco.Hidden gold in Pata
gonia, to which Captain Thomas Owens
was to lead the band of adventurers
on the schooner Academy, was a myth,
according to four members of the ill
fated expedition, who returned to San
Francisco on the Pacific mailer New
port from Balboa. They said that
Owens' real name is John Owen Whof
fer, that he was a poor navigator and
that for three and a half months they
sailed aimlessly around the Pacific un
til they finally reached the Colombian
coast
The Academy left San Francisco
June 21 of last year bound for Pata
gonia, where Captain Owens said there
was gold that rivaled the wealth of
the Incas. With him were several
Californians who had invested in the
enterprise with hopes of great gain.
Eugene L. Halle, H. E. Schuck, Wil
liam Slmms and. H. F. Radke, who
came home on the Newport, were au
thority for the statement that Owens
was incompetent, that he tried to turn
the Academy back to. San Francisco
and that he proposed to sell the schoon

them to the fabulous mines.

RELATES HARDSHIPS
IN PURSUIT OF VILLA
Indian Scout Says Difficulties
Face U. S. Army.
Denver.Some of the difficulties that
face the United States army in its
pursuit of Villa were told here by
James H. Cook, who in 1885 was chief
scout for the Eighth United States
cavalry that crossed into Mexico and
captured Geronimo, tbe Apache chief.
He led the American soldiers over
much of the country the United States
soldiers must cover to get Villa. He
said:
"A veritable zone of death will have
to be traversed by the American troop
ers. They will have to go over some
of the worst country in the world. If
Villa chooses he can fight as Geronimo
and his followers didgo back into the
mountains, kill his horses, scatter on
foot and pick our soldiers off one by
one from behind rocks. It may take
us months, even years, to get Villa.
"But no men on earth are better for
the task than the officers in charge of
the American expedition. I personally
know Lieutenant Colonel D. C. Cabell,
now chief of staff to General Pershing.
He was with me on the Geronimo ex
pedition and knows the country as
well as any white man.
"The aeroplane will assist our troops
in the campaign, but it cannot match
with all the difficulties of the region.
Between the peaks are deep canyons,
sometimes 1,000 feet deep and less
than forty feet wide. These ravines
cannot be crossed by any except the
old Indians of the country. They can
get over on foot.
"The only thing that makes the ex
pedition look hopeful to me is my faith
in the men who command it"

FIRE DRILL SAVES VILLAGE.
Sag Harbor Watch Case Factory Men
Aid Inadequate Force.
Sag Harbor, N. Y.Fire drill in the
watch case factory of Fahys & Co. is
believed to have saved the village from
destruction by fire. Nine business
buildings were destroyed at a loss esti
mated at $75,000.
The village water supply proved in
adequate, so the alarm at the watch
case factory was sounded, the opera
tives' hurried from their homes, organ
ized as taught in the fire drill, manned
a big pump in the factory, helped the
firemen with hose and saved the rest
of the village after a hard four hour
fight
Water froze on thefiremen'sclothes,
and several were overcome by expo

Oatmeal, but Went Crazy.
Clayoquot, B. CMarooned for thir
ty-four days on a small island in the
Pacific ocean is the experience of Ev

island, according to word received here.
He left Ahousat, where he had pur
chased provisions, alone in a canoe, and
when near a small uninhabited island
he was caught in a squall and his ca
noe was swamped.
Fitzpatrick managed to save a sack
of flour, a package of oatmeal and a
few matches. A case of coal oil also
was washed ashore. On these provi
sions he existed for more than a month.
Big waves washed over the small is
land, but by lashing himself to one of
the trees he managed to hold on. He
was found by two Pesquoit Indians in
a demented condition.

East, west, north or south of Kansas
City there are cars loaded with walnut
logs on the sidings and more logs piled

BECOMES BRIDE AFTER
PHONE INTRODUCTION
Theater Party Culminates in
Bachelor Girl's Marriage.
Boston.Whatever may be the status
of the telephone introduction in books
of etiquetteformal, informal or dis
tinctly bohemianit has led to at least
one recent betrothal and marriage in
high social circles. Recently Alfred
Borden, son of Mr. and Mrs. Spencer
Borden of Fall River, was content with
his bachelorhood.
That was before he had heard over
the wire the sweet voice of Miss Susan
B. Ellis of Surrey, England.
He came to hear it in this way: One
night he had "called up" from his
father's cotton mills his friend, Mrs.
Humphreys, and asked her to go with
him to a theater. Mrs. Humphreys had
a headache, or a previous engagement,
or something of equal importance, and
couldn't go.
It was a pity, though, to leave Mr.
Borden a prey to the ennui of a lonely
bachelor evening, and then the seats
too! Mrs. Humphreys would do her
best to fix it
Not many moments later Mr. Borden
was being introduced through the re
ceiver to Mrs. Humphreys' sister, Miss
Ellis, whom Mr. Borden had, strangely
enough, never met, in spite of her suc
cess as "the bachelor girl" of South
ampton, N. Y., last summer.
To make a long story short. Miss
Ellis and Mr. Borden went to the thea
ter, taking Cupid along as a supercargo
in the taxi. The little fellow did the
work well. Only a few weeks later
their engagement was announced, and
the couple were married in the chapel
of St. George's church, fetuyvesant
square. New York.
The bride's father was present, hav
ing come over from England for the
ceremony. After their wedding trip
Mr. and Mrs. Borden will live at Short
Hills, N. J.

WANTED, A POSTMASTER.
Office Discontinued Beeauee No One
For the Job Could Be Found.
Marinette, Wis. The postoffice at
Washington Harbor, Door county, has
been discontinued for the reason that
ill health prevented the postmaster,
L. P. Ottosen, from performing his du
ties, and he resigned.
Uncle Sam made every effort to get
a man to replace the postmaster, with
out success. The job was not only of
fered to several, but advertisements
were inserted in Door county papers,
offering the place to any one who de
sired it, but without success.
The postoffice, which literally went
begging, had to be discontinued be
cause no one would take it The mail
patrons will be supplied by rural de
livery from Detroit Harbor, but the
people are parting with their postoffice
ruefully, because it gate them a gath
ering place and, as one man pat it
"lent dignity to the village."
