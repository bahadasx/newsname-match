El Paso, Tex.. March 31.—The
American expeditionary force into
Mexico in search of Francisco
Villa has fought and won its first
battle and the first blood lost by
American troops has been spilled
at San Geronlmo In the Guerrero
district, according to official Mexi
can reports received here today.
San Antonio, Tex., March 31.—
Villa's .force, estimated at 500, was
severely defeated at Guerrero on
March 29, by Col. Dodd. according
to a report from Gen. Pershing to
Gen. Funston, sent from the San
Geronimo ranch.
Washington, D. C., March 31.—Gen.
Pershing, through Gen. Funston, .^re
ported today *~to the war department
that he had found Gen. Villa with 500
troops near Guerrero.
In a fight with Villa's troops thirty
Mexicans were killed, Gen. Pershing
reported. Four American privates
were injured but none seriously. Two
machine guns, many cavalry horses
and much ammunition was captured
by the Americans. The attack was
a surprise on the Villa forces and cul
minated in a running flght in which
they were driven for ten miles into
the mountains northeast of the rail
way where they separated into small
bands.
The flght occurred about 6 p. m.
March 29 near Guerrero and the re
port came from the San Gerotilmo
ranch. Villa was not present during
the encounter and is reported to be
Buffering from a broken leg and a
lame hip.
Col. Dodd led his seventh and tenth
Cavalry in a. smashing ride from the
north toward Guerrero when he learn
ed of the presence there of the Villa
lorces, covering the fifty-five miles in
tervening in seventeen hours. Gen.
Pershing said he arrived there at 6
o'clock, going into action immediate
ly, but whether it was 6 o'clock in the
morning or in the afternoon the re
port did not indicate.
It was a complete surprise to the
Villa force which had entered into a
celebration of its victory over the gar
rison the day before.
Soon after the action began the Mex
icans werfe breaking for cover and be
ginning to disappear along the trail3
that lead to the mountains northeast
of the railway. For ten miles the run-
uing light that began at Guerrero was
continued and abandoned only when

two ovens, each nearly the size of a
garage, are capable of turning out
5,400 one pound loaves of bread a day.
A one pound loaf of army bread is a
day's ration for a soldier in the field.
It is about the size of a derby hat but
not so symmetrical.
Whatever the outcome of the chase
for Villa* the army is being given an
actual test of the military inventions
under service conditions. All the way
from cook's outfit up to auto trucks
and aeroplanes, hundreds of officers
are acquiring a vast amount of serv
iceable information.
More than one type of motor truck
is in use among the flfty-four machines
of this class doing transport duty.
These trucks are under test in a coun
try without roads, where hill and
mountain climbing on rocky trails are
necessary if the army is to subsist.
The big trucks have done all that was
expected of them.
The aviation service is working un
der conditions calculated to bring out
sharply every necessity which may be
considered in increasing the aero
plane establishment.
The army in the fleld already has
met the probiem of living in a country
which is practically without food. With
the expectation that it would in part
live off the country through which it is
passing, paying for what it consumed,
even the scanty food supplies which
were anticipated in the devastated
Chihuahua districts have not all ma
terialized. Most of the available
pork, for example, has been found

Adaptability of the troops to em

NOTHING TO BE DONE
PENDING INQUIRY
Officials Awaiting Report
From Ambassador at
Germany's Capital
Washington, D. C., March 31.—Fol
lowing today's cabinet meeting, offi
cials said complete evidence had not
been received in the cases of vessels
carrying Americans attacked recently,
that no action would be taken by the
American government until such facts
had been received and that no action
leading to seriouB consequences would
be taken at all unless conclusive evi
dence was established that an attack!
had been made by a German subma
rine contrary to international law.
Awaiting Report.
Government officials admitted today
that they are puzzled over Ambassa
dor Gerard's failure to make response
to instructions Bent him four days ago
to inquire of the German government
whether any of its submarines at
tacked the steamer Sussex and sev
eral other merchant ships carrying
American citizens.
It was hoped that the ambassador
would be heard from before the cabi
net meeting today when it was expect
ed President Wilson would go over the
submarine situation with his advisers.
It is assumed that Germany is with
holding any statement pending reports
from its submarine commanders.
Ordinary delay in communication
with Berlin was one reason advanced
for the failure to receive any response
from Ambassador Gerard. Officials
explained that it usually requires
from thirty-six to forty-eight hours
for a message to reach Mr. Gerard and
{\bout the same time for an answer.'
American Ambassador Page at Lon
don cabled the department today that
he was forwarding by mail additional
affidavits of Americans involved in the
Sussex disaster.
LEADERS SEE LANSING.
Washington, D. C., March 31.—Chair
man Stone of the senate foreign rela
tions committee and Chairman Flood
of the house foreign affairs committee
went over the submarine situation
fully with Secretary Lansing today at
an early conference.
The situation with Germany was de
scribed officially as not being "immi
nent" and it was said that the two
committee chairmen had not come to
the state department by appointment
but had come separately seeking in
formation for the guidance of mem
bers of congress.
The situation may accurately be de
scribed as a waiting one.
Aside from the slowness of commu
nication between Washington and
Berlin, it was pointed out today that
the American ambassador may not
have carried his request to the for
eign office while it was engaged in
the delicate situation in the German
reichstag over the submarine policy.
Chairman Stone said that no coin
plications in the situation inspired his
call upon Secretary Lansing.
"The fact that Chairman Flood of
the house committee was also at the
department was a mere coincidence,1'
said he, explaining that he had gone
to the department only to secure any
additional information on the situa
tion.
GERMANS UNINFORMED.
Berlin, Tuesday, March 28.—(De
layed)— Inquiries in government
circles developed the statement that
nothing is known here concerning the
explosion which damaged the cross
channel steamer Sussex beyond the
newspaper reports from abroad. Of
ficials are refraining from comment iu
the absence of definite information.

GERMAN SOY SPY

PLEA OF CAPTAIN FOR LIFE AND

VENT8 SEA TRAGEDY.
Lewis, Del., March 31.—The young
German who by threatening tlhe use of
a bomb, captured the British steamer
Matoppo and terrorized her crew of
fifty-six men on Wednesday night,
shortly after the ship had sailed out
of New York harbor for Vladivostok
with railroad supplies for the Russian
government, declared today that he
was a spy for the German government.
The ship came back to the United
States under threat of destruction by
its captor. Ernest Schiller, the pris
oner, weary from all the excitement he
had undergone, sought sleep in the
Lewes jail early today.
"Yes, I am a spy for the German
government," he said. "You can be
lieve it or not—it makes no difference
to me. I got my instructions from the
German government to go aboard the
ship and blow her up to prevent her
cargo from reaching Russia. I could
have blown her up but the captain's
plea for his wife and daughter was too
much for me and I hadn't the heart
to do it. I am ready to take the con
sequences but I ask that they keep me
ashore instead of sending me back to
the ship for the captain to take me in
charge."
Schiller had been told that as his
daring exploit occurred outside the
three mile limit, he would in all likeli
hood be taken to British possessions
in the West Indies for trial for piracy.
Federal authorities and representa
tives from the British government
came here today to examine Schiller
and to decide what to do with him.
An examination into Schiller's men
tal condition will be made. Those
who have talked with him believe he
Is Irresponsible and that his story of
his career is not true.
Schiller was reluctant to tell his
history.

Russian Offensive in East
Seems to Have Stopped
Without Success
London, March 31. —German pres
sure on the Malancourt-Bethincourt
salient northwest of Verdun has prov
ed too much for the French on the
westerly end of the position and they
have been forced out of Malancourt
village.
The charge at Malancourt was only
one of three operations against the
Verdun stronghold which the Germans
have put into motion within the space
of a day. Northeast of the fortress
they twice attacked at Douaumont
with liquid fire, but according to the
French war office, were both times
beaten off.
Last night they developed renewed
activity on the edge of the Woevre
plain beginning a drive against the
French right flank and attempting to
take the fortification east of Haudio
mont, about nine miles southeast of
Verdun. They were unsuccessful,
Paris declares.
Berlin announces that in the capture
of the village of Malancourt, which it
declares was carried by storm, 328
prisoners were taken. Defensive po
sitions on both sides of the village al^o
fell intp German hands.
British Aviators Beateh.
In a notable aerial battle near Arras
between German and British aviators,
three British biplanes were brought
down.
The British and Germans are fight
ing around St. Eloi, where German
hand grenades succeeded in reaching a
portion of a mine crater held by the
British. Near Boesinghe the British
repulsed an attack by the Germans.
Many battles in the air have occur
red recently on the western front.
Five German aeroplanes were brought
to earth in the region of Verdun^ two
in the Champagne district and one in
the Somme district. All of the French
machines returned safely, the war of
fice says.
Russian Attack Ends.
The big Russian offensive around
Postavy and Lake Narocz has ceased,
according to the German official report
but in the region of Jacobstadt artil
lery duels are still In progress.
The Austrians and Italians are en
gaded in a big battle in the neighbor,

FRENCH CONFIDENT
OF SUCCESS IN WAR
Paris, March 31. —"We are neglect
ing no means of overcoming tie dif

shall overcome them, because we have
the inflexible will to do so," said Alex
andre Ribot, minister of finance, in
speaking in the senate yesterday in
favor of the votes of credit for the
second quarter of 1916, already approv
ed by the chamber of deputies.
"At the conference of the allies
which has Just been held here," the
minister continued, "the fullest confi
dence was expressed by all that victory
is certain. We shall arrive at a peace
which will restore right and justice
and will deliver the world from a
nightmare which too long has burdened
it." The creditB were passed by unan
imous vote of the senate.
DEATH OF SPANISH
COMPOSER FEARED
Paris, March 31. —The^Spanish em
bassy states that, although Enrique
Granados, the Spanish composer, and
his wife are reported missing, no posi
tive confirmation of their death was
received. The embassy has just been
informed that one of the hospital ships
which picked up some of the injured
from the Sussex has on board a man
and a woman whose identity Is un
known and whose condition is such
that they are still unable to speak.
Hopes are entertained at the embassy
that these persons may be the Spanish
composer and his wife.
Enrique Granados, composer of the
opera Goyescas, the first performance
of which he attended 'at the Metropoli
tan opera house in New York on Jan
uary 27, was reported by survivors of
the channel steamer Sussex as last
seen with his wife clinging to a small
raft. A boat was sent out to search
for the couple but could find no trace
of them.

LITERACY TEST
BILL IS ASSURED
HOUSE PA8SES MEAURE ON TO
THE 8ENATE ALREADY
VETOED TWICE.
Washington, D. C., March 31.—The
flght against the house immigration
bill prescribing a literacy test for the
admission of aliens was today trans
ferred to the senate, although its pas
sage there also is fully expected.
As it went to the senate following
its passage by the house by a vote of
308 to 87 late yesterday, the bill con
tained provisions for a literacy test
and Asiatic exclusion. Opponents of
the measure in the house centered
their efforts on having the Jlteracy
test feature eliminated but in this
they were unsuccessful.
The literacy test was sustained
284
to 107. This provision has been the
cause of vetoes of similar immigra
tion bills by Presidents Cleveland,
Taft and Wilson. The house passed
the bill over the Cleveland veto, but
it failed in the senate. Motions to
override the vetoes of Presidents Taft
and Wilson were lost in the house by
narrow margins.
Representative Burnett, chairman of
the immigration committee, predicted
last night that there was sufficient
strength to repass the bill in the event
of another veto. The president has not
indicated liis purpose to the house
leaders.
Both record votes—on the literacy
test, and on the passage of the bill—
were without regard to party lines.
Majority Leader Kltchin voted for the
literacy test and for the bill. Minority
Leader Mann voted against the liter
acy test and then for the bill.
EXPLORER'S SHIP

A wireless from the Aurora, the aux

INVESTIGATORS OF NEW YORK
CENTRAL WRECK TURN TO
SECOND ENGINEER.
Cleveland, O., March 31.—With the
main issue before them whether man
failure or machine failure caused the
wreck of three New York Central
trains near Amherst, Ohio, early Wed
nesday. federal and state investigators
planned today to go to the bottom in
an inquiry that was expected to last
throughout the day.
Previous to the convening this
morning of the representatives of the
interstate commerce commission and
the Ohio utilities commission, It was
understood that A. H.* Ernst, the sig
nal towennan, had been tentatively
absolved from blame for the wreck,
the death list from which stood at
twenty-eight.
With Ernst out of it as the cause of
the wreck, the inquiry was expected
to simmer down to these two ques
tions
Did Engineer Hermann Hess, To
ledo, pilot of the second section *of
New York Central 86 run by two sig
nals, one ordering him to proceed
wiflk caution and the other ordering
him ro stop hiB train? or
Did the elaborate, costly .signal
mechanism, designed to prevent such
disasters, fall in the final test?
Ernst and HeBs were to appear as
principal witnesses at the examination
today.
