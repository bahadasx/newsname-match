Millions in Damage in Holocaust
Which Swept Over Defense­

LOSS RUNS INTO
ENORMOUS SUM
Flames Still Raing in City, and
No Power Can Stop Them
Till Every Building Burns.
Paris, Tex., March 21.—Fire which
started in the warehouse of the Long
Transportation company, in the south­
ern part of the city, and which quick­
ly spread to the Paris Cotton Com­
press, shortly after 5 o'clock this af­
ternoon had done damage estimated
at almost' «2,00 up to 9 o'clock to­
night and was no under control at
that time.
Thirty blocks of residences and bus­
iness buildings lay in ruins with the
lire raging.
Sixty Percent Burned.
At midnight, at least 60 percent of
the residential and busiess district of
Paris, Tex., thirty miles from here,
had been destroyed by the rapid
spread of a great wall of flames,
which made almost a clean sweep of
thai city in about six hours late this
afternoon and tonight, according to
reports here.
As far as is known here, I here were
no casualties in the Paris lire. This
is regarded as unusual, but the theory
is offered that the conflagration came
at such time as would allow everyone
to leave the danger zone.
Fifteen Houses Standing.
A hurried survey of 111sj businessi
district of Paris at 10:4u tonight
showed only 15 out of more than 140
business buildings still standihg and
Unis far. unmolested by the lire which
swept over the city late this after­
noon and tonight. The lire was still
burning at that, hour, having passed
the public, square into ihe northside
residential district.
Many Heavy Losses.'
On the east side of the public
square the Merrick hotel was gutted
by the flames, and the fire v/is extend­
ed to (he north side of thefyiuare by

Hotel Threatened.
The Gibraltar hotel, a newer struc­
ture htan the Merrick, which cost
about $300,000 was threatened early
tonight. This is about two blocks
east of the Merrick hotel, and has a
chance, it is said, of escaping the
flames.
Borton-Tell Drygoods company, an­
other large wholesale concern, lost its
plant and stock, valued at about $200,
000. The Smiley apartment in the
residential district, completed last
fall at a cost of $300,000, was a total
loss. The palatial home of R. A.
Scott, completed about three weeks
ago, was completely destroyed.
Large residences in the fashionable
part of the city, small houses in the
factory and residence districts,, and
substantial buildings were razed by
the fire, which was fanned by a brisk
south wind.
This section has been without rain
for more than fifty days and the frame
buildings weje quickly consumed. The
Paris fire department was powerless
to stop the onrushing flames. Scarcity
of water was also an impdent.

Utica, in western Arkansas, has been

Scott City has received reports that
the town of Modoc, west of Utica, has

FAMOUS BANDIT OF CIVIL WAR
DAYS, DEAD IN MISSOURI HONE
Lees Summit, Mo., March 21.—Cole
Younger, famous outlaw of border
days, but of late years a devout
church attendant and good citizen,
died tonight on the farm where ,he
was born, 71 years ago. For several
weeks he had been hovering between
life and death and the end came to­
night.
Younger had been out of prison 13
years, after serving a quarter of a
century behind the bars of the Min­
nesota penitentiary for the 'Xorthfield
bank robbery in 1876. His brother,
iEob, died in the prison.
Thomas Coleman Younger, to give
his full name, became an outlaw be­
cause this father was killed as a re­
sult. of his opposition to the war. He
joined Quantrell's band of guerillas
and was present in the memorable
raid on Lawrence, Kan., in which its
garrison of federal troops was put
to death by the guerillas.
The depredations of the James
boys were attracting attention about
the time the war ended and as feel­
ing against the Youngers was still
running high as a result of their ac­
tivities, they were blamed for many
of the acts of the James' gang. Prior
to this time, ihowever, neighbors had
started a story that the Youngers had
been implicated in an Iowa bank rob­
bery. Cole Younger went to Florida
and lived under an assumed name,
in order to get away from a reputa­
tion he had not earned. Unable to
obtain amnesty for what he had done
during the war, Cole Younger finally
conceived the robbery of the North
field, Minn., bank as a means of oh-

VOTED ON FORMER
MEASURE TODAY
Many Ammendments Made to the
Matter Which Is Up for
Consideration.
Washington, March 21.—Although
rapid progress was made in the house
today with the Hay army increases
bill, it was found impossible to reach
a vote before adjournment. It may
be passed tomorrow, it having been
set on Wednesday's calendar for un­
interrupted consideration.
In the senate, Chairman Chamber­
lain of the military committee, now
plans to call up his army bill tomor­
row. He had expected the house bill
to be completed today, and was wati
ing for it, but concluded tonight' that
time would be saved by attempting to
take up the senate measure at once.
Several Important Amendments.
Several important amendments
were made to the Hay bill during the
day. With one exception, they were
approved by Chairman Hay of the mil­
itary committee. After defeating a
proposal by Representative Kahn,
ranking minority member of the com­
mittee, to permit eflicienl, regular sol­
diers to be discharged into the re­
serves in one year on recommenda­
tion of their commanders or in two
years on their own mot ion, the house
reversed its action and put through a
similar amendment by Representative
Gardner of Massachusetts, over Repro
sentative Hay's opposition.
Reserve Officers Training.
The most important amendment
•was th«, tns^rllMt bt the frserve. bffl
cers' training scheme, proposed by
Representative (lard of Ohio, demo
crat, which already has been included
in the senate bill. It provides 1hat
military instructors be supplied by the
war department to any civil educa
tional institution, with an able stud
cnt body of 100 or more and, where a
military course, satisfactory to the
war department is established. A suf
ficient number of graduates would be
designated for six months' additional
training with the regular army to
maintain a corps of 50,000 reserve ofli
cers. The provision wan approved by
the Association of Military Colleges
and Schools..
Give President Gre?t Power.
Another amendment accepted
which was offered by Representative
Kahn, would permit the president to
order out the regular army reserves
without going to congress for author­
ity. The contemplated strength of the
reserve is 60,000, and as the bill now
stands, the president could increase
the regular army from its peace
strength of 140,000 to a strength of
235,000 by executive order, if war
seemed imminent. The last amend­
ment adopted as offered by Repre
sentative of Kentucky, a member of
the committee. It would authorize the
war department to have constructed
all the tools and fixtures necessary
to convert private munition plants for

taining the money he sorely needed.
The robbery failed and three of the
Youngers' gang were taken alive.
Th§ other six met death. Younger
never would admit, the other crimes
charged to him, although there is ev­
idence he participated in many of the
famous raids of those days.

THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR, NO. 70 (NEWS OF THE WORLD) BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA, WEDNESDAY MORNING, MARCH 22, 1916. (BY ASSOCIATED PRESS) mm
Anxiety Prevails Here for the
.. Punitive Expedition Now
Far in Mexico.
FUNSTON ASKS, FOR
"AN ADEQUATE FORCE"
Wires Laid by Advancing Column
Have Been Pestvoyed. Wire­
less Failed at Six Last Night.
Antonio, March 21.—General Fred­
erick Funston asked the war depart­
ment today for more troops to send in­
to Mexico, only after long considera­
tion of the advisability of continuing
the operation against Francasco Villa
with the forces now commanded by
General Pershing General Pershing
yesterday suggested that another reg­
iment be sent to him. and today Gen­
eral Funston asked the department
for what he characterized as an ade
quate force.
Wants More Troops.
It was announced at. General Funs
ton's headquarters that the Fifth cav­
alry, of which one-squadron-is at Ft.
Jlyer, Va., and another at Ft. Leaven­
worth, and the third at. Sheridan
would be brought to the border at
once and bruoght to General Per­
shing's line of communication.
Whether he had asked for more
troops, General Funston would not
say.
Gave As Reason "Lines Weakened."
The only reason given for strength­
ening General Pershing's force, which
is known by the public generally, to
be considerably more than 4.IHI0, was
that his field of operation had become
so extended that his main line of com­
munication and I lie subsidiary lines
were much weaker than they should
be.
A Precautionary Move.
"Merely a prec/iink-nary move," was
tli»r\va,y"tiuiiT0ra)i tt'rl
suggestions to his motives, other than
that it was to strengthen the line. He
was asked if tlie reported movement
of troops of the defaclo government
of the garrison in the interior to posts
on the border and the failure of Car­
ranza troops in one or two instances
to show active co-operation in the
pursuit'of Villa had anything to with
his decision to ask for more strength,
but he declined to answer.
"Wire Cut" Is Report.
Some little uneasiness was display­
ed for a moment, at' his headquarters
today, when it was reported that the
telegraph wires between Casas Gran
des and the border had been cut, but
an official report stating that the line
cut' was a "buzzer" line, General Per­
shing had laid that it had been brok­
en accidentally by some of the Amer­
ican forces crossing it allayed appre
pension.
It is not believed here that General
Funston is worried to any extent by
reports of alleged growing antagon­
ism among Carranza troops, although
he is carefully studying all reports un­
official and official on that phase of
the situation.
-Communication Cut.
Reports emanating from Columbus,
N. M., state wire communication be­
tween the United States and General
Pershing's punitive expedition in nor­
thern Chihuahua was at a standstill
tonight, it was announced from mili­
tary quarters. It was asserted that
the army wireless station at Casas
Grandes failed shortly before 6 o'clock
the only remaining line of communi­
cation into Mexico being by an army
field telegraph wire, which has been
practically useless for several days be­
cause it has been cut in a number of
places between Columbus and its ter­
minus, thirty miles south of the bor­
der.
-El Paso reports state Mexican offi­
cials at Juarez practically conceded
tonight that the cutting of the tele­
phone and telegraph wires between
Juarez and Casas Grandes was the re­
sult of a raid by Villa bandits on the
Mexican Northwestern railroad. The
extent of the raid and the amount of
damage done was not learned.
Only Conjecture.
In the absence of any news from
either General Pershing or General
Gavira, there was nothing left but
conjecture as to the result of the
fighting between Villa and the Carran­
za troops, said to have occurred near
Namiquipa. There was a strong be­
lief that. Villa was not personally in­
volved in whatever fighting had oc­
curred. It seemed reasonably certain
that the bandit chief could not have
been at. Namiquipa and at the various
places at which lie was located in ad­
vices to General Gavira during tho
last week.
Villa Defeated?
If it is true that. Villa had clashed
at Namiquipa with Carranza troops
in a general battle in which he had
been defeated, it appears highly prob­
able that bv this time his followers
have come in contact with the Ameri­
can columns. The advance guard of
the Americans was reported yester­
day at Valle. only 35 miles from Cam
iquipa. It is not believed, however,
that Villa would risk an open fight

GENERAL BELIEF
Douglas, Ariz., March 21.—Slate-ofli*
ciills of Sonora w«r« itrepariag at,
niosillo today with the assistance of
J. luis, tho new attorney general of
the de facto state government, a draft
of the decree ordered yesterday by
General P. Elias Calles to revoke all
state concessions.
Until the draft is iinally completed
and accepted by the military gover­
nor, the full extent to which it will
affect many of the mining corpora­
tions and other concerns operating in
Sonora will not be known.
It Is Confiscation.
Izesg Levier, consul of the Carran­
za government, and officers of Monte­
zuma, Cananea and other mining com­
panies stated, however, that the de­
cree would not act as a confiscation of
the large copper and gold mines in the
state, as the mines and also the rail­
roads leading to the United States
border were held under grants of the
federal Mexican governments. Meth­
ods of operation, taxes paid by the
companies and other laws regulating
the employment of men and condi
tons in general will be changed, they
said.
Will Not Go to Mines.
Plans made by the Montezuma Cop­
per company to return a number of
American workmen to the mines
south of Sonora were changed today
and the men were informed they
would not be needed probably for sev­
eral days.
At the office here of the company,
however, it was stated that no intima­
tion of trouble had been received, but
that those in charge of the mines de­
sired to wait a few days to watch the
trend of events in Chihuahua before
taking any action.
The American employees of the
mines in Montezuma region were
brought to the border last week after
United States troops had been order­
ed into Mexico to capture Francisco
Villa and his bandits. The mines con­
tinued operating with Mexican em­
ployees.

North Dakota's second presidential

H. H. Perry Leads Demos.
H. H. Perry is running away "with

over the Williston man. The Germans
in Stark county turned on Bruegger
and went to Perry—that is, the ones
who did not leave the democratic
primaries and vote as republicans.
Stark For Estabrook by 150.
In Dickinson, for instance, the Ger­
mans on the South Side voted almost
solidly with the republicans, as a pro*
test against Wilson's foreign policy.
Estabrook will carry iStark county byi
150, or more.
All over the Slope it was impossi­
ble to get returns because of the
storm. In the northern tier of coun­
ties a fierce storm is raging and it
was reported from IMinot that in a
large number of precincts not a vote
was polled. It is estimated that
hardly a 25 per cent vote was cast
by the republicans.
