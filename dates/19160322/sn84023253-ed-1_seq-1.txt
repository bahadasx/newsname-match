NO MAPLE SUGAR WAR
George ,C. Cary Not Selling Oil and
Standard Oil Is Not Buying1 Sugar.
Rumors have been current in this
section of Vermont for several weeks
past that the Standard Oil company
in an attempt t punish George C.
Cary, the largest dealer in maple
sugar in Vermont, if not in the world,
for acting as manager of the inde
pendent oil concern in St. Johnsbury
known as the Crew-Levick company
was going into the maple sugar busi
ness in Vermont and pay fabulous
prices to the farmers and put Mr.
Cary out of business. Knowing that
Mr. Cary is not easily driven in his
business methods everyone was look
ing for sensational developments.
Inquiry of persons in a position to
know the situation developed the fact
that the rumors are unfounded. Mr.
Cary several weeks ago voluntarily
resigned the management of the oil
company and it is now conducted by
the Philadelphia office with H. W.
Allen as resident manager. No trace
of an agent to buy sugar for the
Standard Oil company has been found
in Vermont and there is no evidence
they intend to enter the maple sugar
business here this season.

Public Service Commission
INDUSTRIAL EXPOSITION
Guarantee Fund Being Raised Pros
pect of Many Exhibits.
Preparations for the St. Johnsbury
Industrial Exposition are being pushed
and the workers are receiving much
encouragement. Already there are
many applications for space at the
exhibit and the prospect is the space
will all be taken. The sale of spaces
will be opened Saturday morning.
There will be a meeting Ffiday night
at the Avenue House of all commit
tees working on the exposition and the
entire plans will be explained and
plans for operation perfected. The fi
nance committee of the Commercial
club went out yesterday and secured
a guarantee fund of over $200.
The St. Johnsbury U. C. T. have
given their unqualified approval of the
project and will work for its success.
Each local merchant should have a
space and get a jobber to show some
special line with him.
The Public Service Commission of
Vermont was here yesterday to hear
the petition of the Essex Storage and
Electric company for the right to In
corporate under the laws of the state
of Vermont. Some opposition was
made by attorneys for different parties
and the matter was taken under ad
visement by the commission.
The petitioners, Theodore W. Chase
of Passumpsic, Fred D. Gilman, Har
ry H. Carr, Freeman A. Pierce and
Charles G. Braley of St. Johnsbury.
were represented by Alexander Dun
nett. Porter, Witters and Harvey ap
peared for the town of Victory, the
estate of O. M. Gallup, Judge Har
land B. Howe and , the East Haven
Timber company. Elisha May ap
peared for John Lynaugh and N. A.
Norton for the state of Vermont.
Dunnett said that in Victory there
was the bed of an ancient lake now
known as the Victory Bog which pre
sented an opportunity to store an im
mense amount of water. The com
pany that was asking for the right to
incorporate plans to build a dam about
50 feet high and impound about 30,
000,000 cubic feet of water. It wants
to develop this storage and build such
electric plants as it desires on the
Moose river.
Chairman Bacon of the commission
said they wished to know what terri
tory the company proposed to furnish
electricity and Mr. Dunnett said in
Essex and Caledonia counties. The
commission said they also required
an agreement that in the sale of power
people in Vermont should have a pre
ference and Mr. Dunnett said the com
pany would agree to that.
Then the opposition began. Mr.
Porter said he thought it necessary to
show that the public good warranted
such an incorporation and that his
clients wanted to know who owned the
property, what property it wants to
take and where it wanted to build
electric plants. There are five or six
dams along the river and they may be
seriously affected by this company.
His people want to know who is really
back of the company. He under
stood it was not the incorporators
whose names appeared on the petition.
Judge Howe said lie was interested
In a water power on the river and he
wanted to know wh.t this Incorpora
tion means.
Mr. Porter said that the East Haven
Timber company objected because tht
building of this storage lake would in
terfere with their getting out the pulp
wood on their land. He thought the
new company would be a monopoly.
The commissioners said they would
like to know more about the project
and Edward H. Moody, an engineer
from Turners Falls, Mass., was called
as a witness. He said the company
planned to construct a dam 50 feet
high to retain the flood waters from
a water shed covering 72 square miles.
The storage lake would cover about
four square miles and hold 2,500,000,
000 cubic feet of water. The expense
of building the dam would be approx
imately $100,000. The land flooded
is mostly low swampy land and but
little timber would be affected. The
company has already bought about
2,500 acres of land and would have to
buy 1,200 or 1,300 acres more. Not
all of this land will be flowed. The
company had considered the power
possibilities along the river.
Questioned by Mr. Porter, Mr.
Moody said he was employed by the
Turners Falls Power and Electric
company and he thought Chase and
Harriman might be interested in the
project. If the company is incorpor
ated the lands already purchased
would be turned over to it. The work
and expense, rom $8,000 to $10,000
has been borne by the Turners Falls
company. This company owns a pow
er plant on the Conecticut and is in
terested in storing the headwaters of
that river so more water power could
be used in dry times. It would also
like to build electric plants for locai
iise to utilize the water as it passes
down the stream and to sell its in
creased supply of water to owners of
water powers along the Connecticut.
A state fish hatchery is to be estab
lished at Burlington the coming sum
mer according to a statement given
out recently by H. N. Rowley, Chit
tenden county fish and game warden.
It will be located either in the bag
gage room of the old railway station
or on the dock of the Champlain
Transportation company.

FIRST AJD MEETING
New England Telephone Company
Men Gavo Address Before Local
Audience.
A company of about 50 men attend
ed a first-aid meeting at Odd Fellows
hall Thursday evening as guests of
the Passumpsic Telephone company.
Besides the employes of the company
there were present representatives of
the town and village officers, the elec
tric companies at St. Johnsbury, Lyn
donville and Barnet. and the officials
and foremen of E. & T. Fairbanks &
Co. The speakers were D. R. Hawley,
electrical engineer for the New Eng
land Telephone company, and Dr. E.
W. Bullock of Manchester, N. II.
Mr. Hawley who has made extensive
investigation of the cause of accidents
gave a summarized report of the
causes and suggested ways to avoid
them. He said that the majority of
accidents of which record Is kept are
of a minor nature and largely pre
ventable. He referred to other large
corporations which have instituted a
"Safety First" campaign and as a re
sult accidents to employes have been
reduced 70 per cent.
Dr. Bullock demonstrated the plac
ing of bandages, splints and tourni
quets, especially the Prone method,
.nd gave instructions as to the treat
ment of hemorrhages, shocks, burns,
fractures and sunstroke. He said that
the first requirement in an emergency
is a cool head together with a work
ing knowledge of the principles of
first aid to the injured. The telephone
company furnishes a Red Cross first
aid outfit to the various exchanges
and this talk would show the men how
to make the best use of it. The audi
ence listened withe the' closest atten
tion and speak with enthusiasm of the
practical benefit derived.

IN HONOR OF ST. PATRICK
Large Banquet Held At Pythian Hull
Friday Evening.
Over 500 people attended the annual
St. Patrick's day banquet and concert
in Pythian hall Thursday night. Al
though all were fed the limited space
worked against good service and more
or less confusion resulted. Father
Dwyer in his opening remarks sug
gested that the next St. Patrick's day
event be postponed to July 4th ana
held on the fairground. The size of
the crowd and good feeling display;;d
showed the popularity of this annual
event and although it may be post
poned there is little likelihood cf its
being given up entirely. The tables
were decorated with yellow jonquils
and tiny pots of shamrock while harps
and shamrocks adorned the walls of
the banquet hall. Chicken pies in
abundance were furnished by ihe
ladies of the parish and the banquet
was built up around these.
The concert was varied and ex
tremely well rendered. Miss Eliza
beth Peck gave an exquisite rendition
of Irish folk songs and her hearers
were reluctant to let her go, forcing
her to respond to several encores. For
the first time a St. Johnsbury audience
was privileged to hear Mrs. Arthur
Liberty, who sang "Mother Machree"
and "I Hear You Calling Me," two
songs made famous by John McCor
mack. That her offerings were we'l
received was apparent from the ap
plause and she was called back twice.
Other numbers were rendered by Wal
ter Cox, Miss Bessie McEncroe and a
quartet composed of Misses Helena
Brown, Alice Roach, Angelina Sten
son and Mary Cox. The "sympathy"
orchestra, under the direction of John
Pryor Cox elicited both laughter and
tears from the crowd.
MARRIED FIFTY YEARS
Dr. and Mrs. II. C. Newell Quietly Ob
served the Anniversary Monday.
On March 20. 1866 Dr. H. C. Newell
and. Maria H. Hazen were married In

versary of that event and their two
sons, Selim Newell of Holyoke, and
Downer H. of Philadelphia came home
to spend the day with their parents
and sister, Mrs Margaret N. Hey
wood. But the friends knew of the
anniversary and many called during
the afternoon and evening to extend
congratulations. Many presents were
left, telegrams received and quanti
ties of flowers sent by their wide cir
cle of friends.
With the exception of five years in
Barnet Dr. and Mrs. Newell have spent
their married life in St. Johnsbury
and have an unusually large circle of

WORKING FOR SOLDIERS
Ladies Sleet Every Tuesday Afternoon
At the Methodist Church.
The sewing meetings for the sol
diers will be held during March and
April in the vestry of the Methodist
church on Tuesday afternoons at two
o'clock. Seventy-six ladies were pres
ent at the meeting on March 14th and
the silver contribution netted over 56.
The TJ. C. T. have generously con
tributed $25 toward the work and
smaller sums have come in through
other sources. Special collections are
to be taken at the several churches on
Sunday. It is absolutely necessary
that there should be generous financial
support if the work is to be carried on.
Two boxes of knitted sponges have
already been sent. This week one
large box of bandages rolled by the
ladies and knitted sponges goes to
the French wounded, a box of sur
gical dressings, comfort pillows, etc.,
to the Red Cross and a box containing
over 60 bags for the soldiers to the
English hospitals.
