335,000 Paid Out for Hogs.
The hog market in Adair county
county has been exceedingly brisk for
the last' six weeks, and a vast tota
sum of money has been paid for them.
One fine has purchased about $15,000
worth, and summing up what has
been paid by other dealers, the sum
total reaches $35,000. This informa
tion we get from the two banks of Co
lumbia. The hogs were all sold on the
Louisville market, and it is our infor
mation that the dealers are well satis
fied with prices realized, the market
at this time being active.
This money all remains at home,
which is an evidence that Adair coun
ty is not on the verge of starvation,
but stands ready to loan meal to
friends at any time.

Will Return Home Soon;
A letter from Mr. J. P. Dohoney,
Sr., who is in St. Anthony Hospital,
Louisville, to his family, states that
he feim'provlng nfpldly. He is now

home in a very few days. He' is In

Not Now, But Later.
The people of Green county would
like to have a new court house, but at
present, with the railroad tax question
unsettled, it would be impossible to
get the fiscal court to levy a tax for a
public building. There are many cit
izens who are living in the hope that
some day the county will be relieved
of its burden, and that day many
think will come before, a great while.
In our judgment, if Green county
could arrange to settle, by compro
mise, the railroad debt, the historic
town of Greensburg would take on
new life Not only a court house
would be erected, but many business
houses and handsome residences would
go up. But when you think of the
present temple of justice, in the
hearts of the oldest citizens, there is a
tender feeling thatjingers for many
men, now dead, who became prom
inent, and who commenced the prac
tice of law in the old historic building.
There were Wm. P. Willis, Aaron
Harding, the Barnetts, the Buckners
and Ward's, who as attorneys, gained
reputations all over Kentucky.

Mountain Dare.
Wilson Bros., of Care City, recent
ly sold to G. L. Jones, Hatcher, Tay
lor county, the show stallion, Moun
tain Dare, by Chester Dare, dam by
Montrose.' Mountain Dare is a show
horse that has to his credit many
blues won in some of the best gather
ings of show horses that meet oh the
show grounds throughout the-State.
He holds as high rank as a breeder as
his aristocratic blood warrants, having
sired Mauk, the show horse that won
many premiums in the East last year,
and sold for $2,350 00. We did not ob
tain the price paid for Mountain Dare,
but understand that it was no small
sum. Mr. Jones is to be congratulat
ed in securing this horse and will
doubtless be rewarded by a most liber
al patronage It is a good sign to see
our stockmen retaining the best stall
ions produced in this section a'hd add
ing to the stud some of the most fash
ionable breeds produced in other sec
tions. High class horses are the ones
that it pays to raise. Wilson Bros.
say, in their opinion, they never
owned a finer horse or better breeder
than Mountain Dare.
Married in Casey County.
Wednesday of last week, Mrs Ten
nie Smith, of this county, was mar
ried to Mr. Thos Miller, of near
Dannville. Mrs. Smith has been a
saleslady in a dry goods store, in Ca
sey county, for some time, and it was
at the store, where the couple first
met. Mr. Miller is said to be a very
prosperous farmer. Mrs Smith's rel
atives and friends in Adair extend
their bestwishes.
The Greensburg Loose Leaf House
will close for the season in a very few
days. The management informed a
News man last week that the business
for this year had been satisfactory,
but not quite so good as last season.
They handled many thousand pounds,
and secured as good prices for the
farmers as any other house in this
part of the State. The profits to the
company were not as great as in the
past, due in a measure to tobacco be
ing too dry most of the season. It is
well enough that we have only one
loose leaf house in this part of the
State, as dividing the profits would
make the business undesirable.
Miss Grace Hobson and Mr. Shirley
Finnell, both of Campbellsville, sur
prised their friends by going to Leba

married. The bride is a daughter of
Mr.m. Hobson. Only a short time

the Federal grand jury, court being in
session at Louisville,
The business interests of every
town should be interested in having
large crowds to attend the county
courts, once a month. People make
business, and when three to five hun
dred farmers come to town, they are
sure to leave a goodly some of money
in it. Our observation is that Satur
day is the best business day for Camp
bellsville, and that court day is noth
ing more than an ordinary day, In
fact, many people of the town would
not know that county court was In
session were thev not told If the
business men of Campbellsville want
to see trade lively on court days, let
them induce the farmers of Taylor
county to bring the stock they have
