Journal. The Journal's account i8-
eludes the following:
Many stirring episodes incidental to
the attack on Columbus . are told ta
newspaper despatches, and among
them are the following: Mrs. Ryan,
wife of Capt. Thomas F. Ryan."of
Troop R, and Capt. Rudolph E. Smy
ser of Troop H, with Mrs. Smyser and
her little children, had narrow escapes
from the bandits. The Ryan house,
near regimental headquarters, was
riddled with ballets. Mrs. Ryau was
in bed in line with a front window .
facing the ditch in which Villa opened
the attack. Bullets shattered the
glass and struck through her clothing
arranged t!n a chair near the bed. Pt
Fred Griffin. Troop K. 13th Cavalry,
was on sentry duty ; In front of the"
headquarters and opened lire on a
party of Mexicans attacking the quar
ters of Lieut. John P. "Lucas, com
manding the machine-gun troop. Grif
fin fell mortally wounded under a vol--ley
of bullets, but killed two Mexi
cans. Mrs. Ryan ran around the side
of the house,, under fire of the Mexi
cans, to an adobe garage. A party of
bandits was standing about Griffin.
She opened the garage, -when. a Mexi
can grasped her- arn and demanded
where she was going. She answered
calmly that she was going into the
buildins to get a motor car. The Mex
ican let her go, and during the fight
ing in the camp she remained injthe
automobile unhurt. Every .piece of
furniture in the Ryan home was rid
dled. The Smyser home, north of the rail
road track, was surrounded on three
sides. Capt. Smyser. gathering his
wife and children together in their
night clothes, emerged from the: back
door and reached the barn. The pan
dits looted the house and were pre
paring to set fire to the barn when the
American forces opened fire. Leaving
