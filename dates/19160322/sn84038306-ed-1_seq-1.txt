-1 gentle, refined In taste. During her
later girlhood and, her early married
life, she was one of the, most active
workers in the Congregational church

1895. When later thi responsibilities
of motherhood came to her. her home
became the center of her life and
thought, and she gave herself to its
demands with unstinted devotion.
She was a woman of fine mind, fond
of good literature, and given to much
quiet study and reflection, but ready
at the same time to give what time
and strength she could spare to every
form, of helpful enterprise undertaken
in the community.

His Manchester friends deeply re

their sincere sympathy to his bereav

and three sons and a daughter.
It was Mr. Johnson's ability and en

up to its present high rank and de
velopment. He was the first supr
intendent and took charge on Jan
uary 18th, 1S97, remaining until the
fall of 1910. He came here before the
original construction work was finish
ed. Few of the buildings were then
complete and but a few ponds had
been constructed. It was his task to
initiate the work for which the sta
tion was established. After success

of the most rigid and thorough type.,
The club lays particular emphasis
upon rich and reiined quality of tone,
purity of intonation, flexibility of ex- j"1

singing which is one of the chief!
charms of a male chorus.
Perhaps there are college glee I

individual voices are good and they
have been trained to remarkable pre

and the perfection of. style with which
each song was presented, made the
concert a genuine pleasure. The or

DUFFY HOME DESTROYED BY
FOE.
Last Frdiay evening fire destroyed
the house on the R. j..Duffy farm, two
and one-^ialf miles south af Manches
ter. The fire is thought to have
started on the roof from a spark from
the chimney. It was not discovered
until the bhize gained such headway
that there was no chance to save the
building. Most of the household goods
on the first floor, were removed, but
on the house and $260 on the con
tents. The home was large and well
furnished and equipped with modern
improvements and conveniences. The
building cannot be replaced, it is esti
mated for less than $4,000. The loss
on personal property considerably ex
ceeds the insurance carried.

tutions.
Officers of administration are mak
ing preparations to handle a big en
rollment. Last summer they found
themselves called upon to care for an
attendance of 883, after having had

the attendance may pass the thousand
mark and plans are being made so
that all who come will be properly
treated.
The experiment of last year with
the ten weeks' session divided into pe
iods of six weeks and four weeks
proved highly- satisfactory, and this
year the work will again be extend
over ten weeks.
