E. II. Chaffee Dies at Pownal
Edwin H. Chaffee, nearly a life long
resident of the west part of Morristown,
died at the home of his daughter and
husband, Mr. and Mrs. Clyde Peckham,
in Pownal, last Saturday, after a long
period of ill health, death being due to
general debility due to advanced age.
The funeral was held from the home
Monday afternoon, interment taking
place in Pownal. Glenn A. Wilkins, who
is a nephew of the deceased, left Saturday
night for Pownal to attend the funeral.
The deceased was a prosperous and
highly respected farmer in the west part
of town for many years and moved to
Pownal with Mrs. Chaffee in 1905,
where they have since resided. He was
a son of Horace and Matilda Reed Chaf
fee and was born in Morristown 77
years ago next June. He is survived by
a wife, whose maiden name was Mary
Ling, the one daughter mentioned above,
a sister, Mrs. Austin Wilkins, of Morris
ville, and one granddaughter, Miss
Rachel Peckham.
Death of Former Resident
Anstin Wilkins and son, Glenn A. Wil
kins. were in St. ohnsbury last week
Tuesdav to attend the funeral of Walter
D. Wilcomb. who died Saturday, March
11, at Brightlook hospital from the ef-
fects of a second operation tor tiernia.
Walter Davis Wilcomb was born in St.
Johnsbury. June 2, 1866. He attended
the public schools in St. Johnsbury and
in early manhood went to Swanton to
engage in railroad work. Mr. Wilcomb
was a conductor on the St. Johnsbury &
Lake Champlain for twenty years, and
during that time made his home in Mor
risville and Swanton. He went from
here to St. Johnsbury twenty-two years
ago. He retired from railroad work
some time ago and for several years had
been engaged in the grocery business and
had lately purchased a meat business.
He is survived by a widow and one son.
Archie D. Wilcomb.
The Sugar Season Approaches
The sugar season is near at hand, in
fact word comes from all sections that
the farmers are making preparations for
the first run. Every indication points
to one of the best seasons in years and
as the unusual depth of snow will make
gathering difficult in many places, break-
ng roads is an important part of the
work at the beginning of the season.
There is the smallest amount of old
sugar on the market known to dealers
for years and for this reason as well as
others, it is predicted that the prices
will start high.
The annual report of the Commis
sioner of Agriculture of Vermont shows
the total value of the maple sugar pro-
uct in Vermont was $1,356,526, prac-
ically 26 cents per tree tapped. There
were also, it is figured, 4,721,737 maple
trees available that were not tapped in
the State. This shows that the maple
ugar production of the State might be
nearly doubled. Figured at 26 cents a
tree, it would give an annual income of
$1,227,651, a sum that would seem
worth while to the maple sugar maker.
The local wholesale dealer, H. Waite
& Son, give the above figures in tons
and fisure that there were 250 15-ton
cars of sugir and 200 cars of syrup pro
duced in Vermont last year. Let La
moille County do her full share this year.
The Waites already have orders tor a
large amount. "
D. A. R. Entertained
Mrs. T. C. Cheney entertained the D.
A. R. at her home on Harrison Avenue
last week Tuesday. The occasion had
been designated as "guest day" and each
member was requested to bring a guest.
Mrs. Howe, who was to havehadcharge
of the meeting, prepared a paper, which
was read by Mrs. Harriet Ide, who had
charge in her absence. Other members
of thesbapter read articles upon the sub
ject, "The New Hampshire Grants."
Victrola music was enjoyed and light re
freshments were served.
Entertainment of Rare Merit
A large and appreciative Audience
gathered to hear the entertainment,
"The Cotter's Saturday Night", given
by the Scotch Musical Comedy Company
at town hall last Thursday evening and
it is safe to say that no one regretted his
presence. The program was one of the
most enjoyable presented here in many
years, and the walls rang with merri
ment and applause as the actors made
their jests and sang their songs. Each
member of the oompany was a soloist of
marked ability, and the ensemble work
was excellent, while the staging and cos
tuming was such as to take one straight
back to the peasant's cottage of the
eighteenth century.
The poem which furnished the basis of
the entertainment is supposed to have
been intended by B'urns to depict a scene
of his own youth, and from the moment
that the curtain rose upon the humble
living room with Margaret, the farmer's
wife, singing at her knitting, until the
last "Gude nicht" had been said, the au
dience was transported to the land of
Bonnie Prince Charlie, where a "A Man's
a Man for a' That." Special mention -should
be given to the rendering of "An-
I nie Laurie" by the entire company,
My
, Laddie" by Margaret Alexander, "John
Anderson, My Jo by Jeanne Tanner,
UUUUKi uy
and "Bonnie.
Mr.
Springer.
This entertainment formed the closing
number of the course, given under the
auspices of the Woman's Club. The club
reports a most gratifying year financial
ly, $60.00 having been cleared, and re
quest this paper to thank all who have
contributed to the success of the project.
