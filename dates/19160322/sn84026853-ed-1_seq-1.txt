VILLA HEMMED IN <
BY U. S. TROOPS
PERSHING BEGINS DISPOSITION I
OF TROOPS UNDER HIS COMMAND
TO CAPTURE BANDITS
EI Paso, Texas, March 19.?Francisco
Villa has been driven into trap <
by the rapid advance of the Ameri- 1
can troops, according to the informa- 1
tion received to-day in wireless dis- <
patches from the front and in telegraphic
dispatches to Gen. Gavira,
the Carranza commander, at Juarez.
Everything seems now to depend
on the ability of the Carranza garrisons
to hold their end of the net. On
three sides the bandit chief he is
hemmed in by strong Carranza columns,
while on the fourth the Americans
are driving forward with amaz- ?
ing speed. J
Villa was reported in the Babricora j
Lake region to-night on the ranch of j
Mrs Phoebe Hearst, which he has j
ravaged several times in the past, j
Babricora .is about fifty-five miles (
south of Galeana, where one section
of the American expeditionary force j
has arrived, and is pushing forward
at the rate of thirty-three miles a
day- A few miles to the west of J
the bandit's positions is Namiquapa, J
which is held by a powerful Carranza *
garrison. On the east are the frown- J
ing barriers of the Sierra Madre *
Mountains, barring the way to Son- J
ora. Gen. Luis Guitierrez, Carran- 1
za's field chief, declares that he holds 1
all the passes to Sonora.
Hangs on Carranza.
On the south Villa's way is blocked i
oy me carranza garrison <x\, jinucia, i
a town of considerable importance, i
as the headauarters of the Madera <
Company, Ltd, an American concern, 5
which has vast lumber, mining and <
railroad interests. On account of the 1
importance of this town an excep- s
tionally heavy Carranza force is said J
to hold it. The whole situation seems
to hang tonight on the Carranza j
forces. If they remain loyal to the
first chief, which up to the present
time they have shown every indication
of doing, Villa appears trapped.
It is, of course, realized that he is on
ground of his own choosing and a
country admirably suited for guer- !
rilla warfare and surprise attacks.
While Carranza leaders and the
United States military authorities 1
have succeeded so far in avoiding ^
any friction there is one serieus ques- 1
tion which may arise at any time to (
threaten the entire situation. As the .
lines of commutation of the Ameri- 1
can force lengthen the problem of ,
bringing up supplies becomes increasingly
more pressing. j
To errant the United States Dermis
gion to use the Mexican railroads for
shipping supplies it is thought here
may be misconstrued by many Mexicans.
On the other hand a refusal
would scarcely harmonize with the
professed desire of the Carranza
Government to co-operate in every
way with the American authorities.
The arrival of this crisis is being anxiously
awaited on both sides of the
border.
Wireless From the Army.
With the American Army, March
18?(Via Wireless to Columbus, N.
M.)?After marching more than 110
miles into Mexico in forty-two hours
the American punitive expedition today
received information apparently
locating Rancho Villa, the object of
their chase. Disposition of the troops
began to-night for the task of hunting
him down. Meanwhile Villa was
reported continuing his outrages upon
Americans.
The exDedition reached (name
deleted by censor.) They were in- '
formed that the Mexican leader pass- j
ed through this place only a few days
ago. The latest information of Villa's !
present whereabouts placed him on ]
the ranch of Candelarlo Hernandez, 1
one of the sub-chiefs with him on the j
raid against Columbus.
Gen. Pershing personally led the
flying cavalry column in the 110-mile
dash. Every man in his command was '
mounted. They passed through a section
of Mexico where water was ]
scarce. For such a large body of men '
the speed maintained was remarkable
and the good condition in which 1
they came through was inspiring. ,
Only a few cavalry horses and ;
pack mules were lost, the victims of
- ? ? mt 1 i ,
a bard riaaen trail. ine men reai-neu
the camp thirsty and hungry, but '
otherwise in good condition, fit for
action and eager for the pursuit of
Villa to begin in earnest. Here they
were met with reports that Villa had
raided the American colonies in the
vicinity of his mountain retreats and
that he had killed residents of these
colonies.

The house completed more tha
lalf of its set schedule of ten hour!
general debate on the army increas

jxpressed their views. The great mj
iority favored the committee bil

Fected army bill taken up Monday
The water power bill must be dis
placed to permit this. President Wi

The failure of any organized oppc

DETROIT WOMAN
ESCAPES BANDITS
DETROIT WOMAN HID IN MINE
WITH HER BABY FROM
MEXICAN BANDITS.
ElPaso, March 19.? Mrs. Wallace
Rogers of Detroit, arrived here
today with her 15-months old infant,
and told how she had hidden with her
baby for two days in the shaft of an
abandoned mine near Cananea from
Mexican bandits.
.Mi$. Rogers' husband is interested
in'mining property near Cananea but
was away from home when tne little
colony fied on the approach of the
oanaits.
"The whole country around where
[ was living," said Mrs. Rogers was
filled with abandoned mines, the
3hafts of some of which had been
sunk 2,000 feet or more. Most of the
American men were away when we
aeard of the approach of the bandits
We fled to one of the abandoned minis
carrying whatever food we could
match up. One of the men took my
jaby and we crawled down an abandjned
shaft by ladder until we reached
:he 1,000 foot level. Here we renamed
.for 24 hours*
"Finally, as we heard no shooting
>ne of the men ventured to the surface.
He reported everything quiet
ind we returned to our homes. We
lad hardly reached there however,
when we again heard that the bandits
were coming. This time we went
iown to the 1,500 foot level where we
remained another day. We were
n a little slope about 10 feet square.
(Ve had no lights of any kind, and
[ had only a couple of cans of coniensed
milk to feed my baby. We
ust sat there on the floor in the blackness
and prayed. At last we could
stand it no longer. I think we w6uld
lave all gone mad if we had stayed
:here . We crawled up into the sunshine.
There was no sign of the baniits
and we made our way safely to
3ananea where we got a train."
Mrs. Rogers declared that the
Mexican bandits not only had no respect
for the American flag but that
t actually incited them to outrages,
;he only flag that offered any proaction
was the British flag, she said.
"I am bitterly .ashamed to admit
t," she said, " but whenever trouble
started we began to hunt for a
Union Jack.' It was by no means
i bullet proof shield but it was the
>nly flag that I ever saw that the Mexicans
paid any deference to. There
was a young Englishman who commit?d
suicide where I was. The Mexicans
thought he was an American
ind they hurriedly dug a shallow hole
and were going to put him away
without ceremony when the officer in
command overheard someone say:|
I wish we knew where his mother is
so we could notify her. She is somewhere
in England but I do not know
where.' The officer stopped the burial
and asked if the suicide was an
Englishman. When he learned that
he was, he ordered the body preserved
and tried for four days to get
in touch with an English consul."
Another refugee who reached here
today had traveled 200 miles on a
motorcycle in search of safety.
IF VAUGHN IS CRAZY
HE MAY MISS DEATH
Spartanburg, March 19.?Special:
Thurston U. Vaughn, who is in the
State Penitentiary under death sentence
fo* heinous crimes which he
confessed to have committed while
he was superintendent of the South
Carolina Odd Fellows Orphanage
here, is to be incarcerated in the
State Hospital for the Insane. Solicitor
P. A. Bonham stated to-day that
he will apply next week for an order
from the Circuit Court to transfer
Vaughn. A test of Vaughn's sanity
will be made while he is in the State
Hospital.
If the tests show Vaughn to be insane
he will escape the death penalty.
Vaughn was convicted on October 26,
1912, and was sentenced to be electrocuted.
His attorneys have appealed
his case to the State Supreme
Court and to the United States Supreme
Court, which tribunals sustained
the judgment of the Circuit
Court. A decree of insanity is the
only thing that can now save Vaughn
from the chair.
Solicitor Bonham decided to take
the step to have Vaughn placed in
the Hospital ,after correspondence
with Governor Manning ana Dr. J.
Heyward Gibbs, of Columbia.

nor Manning, who is in Florida, Senator
McLaurin went to New York on
Friday night to confer with prominent
insurance men, in response to a
wire from them to Senator McLaurin,
which seems to hold out some promise
of a satisfactory adjustment of
the insurance situation in this State.
Advices received from New York
on Sunday are to the effect that Senator
McLuarin was in a conference
on Saturday night, which was also
attended by Insurance Commissioner
McMaster, and that there is not the
slightest friction between Commissioners
McLaurin and McMaster, but
on the contrary they are working in
harmony. Commissioner McLaurin

U. S. AND MEXICO I
TO CRUSH VILLA
PROTOCOL BETWEEN COUN- C
TRIES SUGGESTED BY MEXI
CAN AMBASSADOR.
Washington, March 20.?The Carranza
government today proposed to i*
the United States the drafting of a 81
protocol, under which American and 11
Mexican troops may co-operate in ei
hunting Villa. The terms of such a S(
formal convention would be designed
to meet all questions which arise in a:
the future, setting forth the rights of ?
American troops now in Mexico and b;
the nature of co-operation expected tl
of the Carranza forces. The fact was ti
suggested to the state department to- u
day by Eliseo Arredondo, the Mexi- fi'
can ambassador. Negotiations of details
are expected to be in progress
several days, but the two ' govern- B
ment were said to agree on the prin- bi
ciples involved. *
While the protocol is expected to
take care of such details as use of r<
Mexican railroads by Americans,
General Funston's recent request to P
allow supplies to go forward now
from El Paso is to be handled separately
and at once.
CERTAIN NATIONS WOULD "
HELP MEXICO IN WAR J]
Washington, March 15.?On re- gc
quest of the state department orders ej
have been sent to collectors of cus- l
toms at seaports of the United States p
and along the Mexican border to hold B
up all shipments of arms, ammunition a<
or explosives consigned to Mexico ex- 0i
cept such as it is clearly established zc
are designed for the de facto government.

shipments to mining companies or
other persons not officially represent- ~
ing the Carranza government. How 0
long they will remain in force was c]
not known tonight.
Officials tonight refused to discuss ^
the subject but there was reason to .
believe some credence had been
placed in recent reports that friends .
of certain European nations had been
willing to put munitions of war at "
the disposal of Villa.

COTTON MEASURE ^
i v
Washington, March 14?Representative
Lever today introduced his o
cotton standards bill, which provides a
for th e establishment of uniform tl
standards of classification for cot- p
ton and provides for the application, a
enforcement and use of such stand- T
ards in transactions in interstate and
foreign commerce and provides for n
protection against the misuse of the r<
standards. E
Standards of grades for cotton
have already been Established and p
promulgated. This bill undertakes to

the machinery for proper grades and
classifying of cotton through licensed
graders that goes into interstate d

"This bill," said Mr. Lever, "is j
one of several which go to make up c;
what I am pleased to term the ajrricultural
end of the administration ?]
preparedness programme. The other d
bills included in this programme are
the reenactment of the cotton fu- p
tures act to overcome the technical b
decision of a New York federal judge n
declaring the act unconstitution- y
al, the federal warehouse bill, which s,
will furnish a uniform warehouse ^
receipt issued from federally super- d
vised and bonded warehouse, the
grain bill, providing for a federal
system of supervision of grain grad- e
ing, and the land mortagage credit y
bill, which undertakes to set up a 5
ing cheaper credit for long terms on n
the amortization plan of repayment j-j
for farmers. This constitutes the jj
most ambitious programme of legis- v
lation in behalf of agriculture ever ^
proposed in any legislative body, a
but complete preparedness can not C('
exist unless it takes into considerat- ^
ion agriculture and economic preparedness
as well as military and a
naval preparedness. The fact is that C(
the latter kind of preparedness can ^
not be greater than the former, for r)
military and naval preparedness are
agriculture and economic prepared- p

RITAIN TO LAY
BAN ON LUXURIES
.
London, March 17.?A coming or- , 'l
er in council which will totally jproibit
importation into the United
[ingdom of a large number of artiles
which come under the general
eading of luxuries, will be issued by
ie British government at an early
ate.
Among the things which will be,
laced under the ban will be automoiles
for private use, musical instrulents,
cutlery of all kinds, hardware,
arns, chinaware, fancy goods and
Dans. The order will apply equally
> all countries, including the British
ominions and colonies.
This forecast of the coming order
1 council was given to the Associate
d Press today in an interview tiy
Palter Runciman, president of the
oard of trade. Mr. Runciman adkitted
that articles in addition 'to
lose named would be placed on the
st of prohibited imports, but in adance
of the issuance of the order
e declined to say what they are. He
greed that the decree would have
onsiderable effect on exports from
le United States but pointed out
lat it applied to all countries alike,
nd declared it was absolutely neessary
to limit the shipment of
ulky luxuries in order to provide
som on ships for necessities.
"But, please remember," said Mr.
:unciman, "that.the issue of this orer
is forced on the country?not as
matter of policy, but entirely beause
of a shortage in tonnage. We
rant exports from the United States;
re want your wheat, cotton and meat
nd we need other things which we
annot get if the space aboard vessels
i taken up with luxuries.
"Everything possible is being done
) relieve tne shortage in snips, rjvry
ship flying the British flag is now
ontrolled by the government. Imlense
numbers of them have been
equisitioned; others are subject to
irection by way of licenses. Whethr
it will be necessary to requisition
lore vessels, I can not say, but I
ope this will not be done."
