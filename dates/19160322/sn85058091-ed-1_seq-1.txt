HOW TO AVOID L08INQ
YOUR MONEY.
Excellent suggcstlona on thrift are
Issued by tho Ainorlcan JUankoru as
boclation, In weoKly lottora to tho
press.
Willi Uio coming of prosporlty,
thoro is a warning agalntt tho pro
moter who promises groat wealth ou
small iuvostuiont. When an offer Is
too roHoato, constdor It more carefully
than If tho returns aro within a legi
timate margin of protlt. Here Is a
suggestion:
Tho roally big things aro not
liawkod tvbout tho stroots llko vogo
tables. Tho big deals aro not for tho
"dear public." Honry Ford uovor of
fered his stock broadcast. A cortaln
Now York undertaker, now bankrupt,
did. Standard Oil novor wont with
hat In hand, Booking thoso who would
buy. Dig things aro for the few;
llttlo things for tho rauuy.
Harry Lauder, who has saved,
though In tho company of spend
thrifts, has a, few homoly maxims:
Dohavo toward your purso as you
would to your best frlond.
View tho reckless spending of
money as criminal and shun tho com
pany of tho reckless spondor.
Dress neatly, but not lavishly. A
bank pays a higher rate of interest
than your back.
Tako your atausemoDts Judiciously.
You will onjoy tuom better.
Don't throw away tlio crusts oat
