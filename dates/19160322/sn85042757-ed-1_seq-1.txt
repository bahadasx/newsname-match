NEW SHEEP NAME
The Name proves a Very Fitting One as
the Experience of Harry Martin,
Here Related, Conclusively
Shows Read Carefully
The Golden Hoof is the new name
given to sheep, and a good and proper
name it is ; for when sheep are kept
and properly managed they are great
est source of revenue that a farm can
produce. They improve the soil faster
than any other of our domestic animals.
DO WELL HERE.

several good reasons why they should
be raised on every farm in the county.
It costs very little to start a flock.

tained and the most laportant feature
of ail is they yield a revenue twice a
year : a clip ot wool each spring and a
crop of lambs for tall sales. The wool
will pay any farmer for maintaining a
flock ot ewei and the lambs can be
made clear profit.
MAKING A START.
In 1912 I decided to make my start
in sheep. I bought a bunch of 19 head
that had been running arond my place.
I paid 250.00 for them. 1 bought a
grade buck tor $4.00 and arother ewe,
that had strayed here, for $2.50 mak
ing a total of $56.50. I sold one small
lamb for mutton, $2.00, leaving my in
itial cost $54.50.
Jan 1st, 1913, my invoice was 15 ewes
at $8.00; 1 buck, 5.00; 2 wethers, at
$2.50 each, making a total of $55.00
Loss for 1912 was one ewe and one
wether strayed or killed, $5.00.
1913 sold wool amounting to $16.50

Ewes that raise lambs do not shear
as heavy fleece as wethers, and some

lambs will not bring any lambs this
year.
COST VERY LITTLE.
1 let my sheep run on the range nine

during September, October and part
months in the year. I keep- them up
November. This is done to prevent
ewes from getting with scrub bucks
that run on the range and to keep them
from breeding too early.
TIME OF BREEDING.
1 do not breed my sheep until No
vember as 1 think it much better to
'have lambs come in April as there is
i grass then and it is easy to raise the
lambs. Early lambs are hard to raise
in this cilmate and are very costly as

weeks at lambing tune. You will :ilso
note hat I make no charge for pas
ture. They leave enough manure on
the ground to pay for that. You will
also see 1 have made no charge for la
bor, which is a considerable part of
keeping sheep, for they require a good
deal of attention and should be looked
after carefully. That is where most
men make their mistake with sheep, in
thinking they can take care of them
selves, but iu stock I have ever ban
died yield more for good care than
sheep.
1 do not il alter my sheep any at all.
The ones 1 I ve raised have never laid
under a root a their lives, but I think
good roomy i .en sheds should be pro
vided for tlx i and I intend to provide
some for nr ie.
You will ??e my loss has been light
and the dog h ' not been in my sheep
but one time. though one lives in
daily fear of tU... destroying the flock.
I owe BMtGii ui my success to my
friend, R. R. Dunbar, who has been
raising sheep much 'nnger than I have
and is very successtul with them. He
furnisned me much information on how
he succeeded and also sold me some
valuable stock to build my herd on.
Now, to succeed with sheep, 1 do not
believe in large herds, but each farmer
to keep what he can handle : from 10
to 100 head.
Large herds of sheep have not done
i well here. The stomach worm be
I comes troublesome when they graze
! continually over the same ground. In
i small groups they change their grazing
ground of their own accord.
We have great need of a law to pre
I vent bucks from running at large on
i the range, as one would not have to
; keep up ewes in fall ana then one could
j raise the kind of sheep they wanted to
and have their lambs come when want
ed. j 1 raise Shropshires. I have bred to
a registered buck for two years and
j now have some splendid bred sheep,
i There is no question about a good uni
form flock being more valuable than a
: mixed one.
We iiave one advantage here at
' Lodendale Stock Farm that many parts
of the county do not have. That is, a
' good winter range. Winter grass
I grows very plentiful here and in many
; places over the county it is to be found
1 in abundance. It is fine tor sheep and
I when there is no such grass, people
1 have to feed moie, but sheep can be
J ranged more in stock fields and to clean
j up waste places.
i 1 consider that to be successful, one
! ought to have some pasture and, ot
course, the more pasture the bettei,
and where sheep are raised in largt
flocks pastures are imperative, but
i every farmer in this county can raise
1 some sheep at a profit.
Harry Martin.
A few days ago one of the leading
sheep men of the county stated to the
Chronicle editor that he had a small
bunch of ten ewes that he had recently
refused to sell tor $9 00 a head. When
we expressed surprise at his refusing
" large a price he explained that each
ot them would shear $2.00 in wool,
would likely raise a lamb that he could
sell this fall for $6.00 and he did not
consider it good business to part with
an animal tor nine dollars that would
j bring him eight dollars profit. He fur
ther stated that he would have refused
j $12.00 a head had it been offered. The
buyer told him they were the best
sheep he had ever seen. The owner
said he had been eight years bringing
his sheep to that point of excellence
I and that he bad done it by using pure
i blood bucks. There is a striking lesson
j in this that should be of great value to
our farmers generally. Editor Chronicle.

Herbert Whittaker, Aged 18.
Monterey, March 21. (Special.)
Alvin H. Countis, night policeman
here, was shot and instantly killed at
2:05 o'clock Sunday morning by Her
bert Whittaker, aged 18. Young Whit
taker, it is alleged, was under the in-
UL a -
of . "uence OI whiskey and was ordered by
Doilceinan Countis to go home or sub
mit to arrest. This order by Countis
only angered Whittaker, whereupon he
was felled to the ground twice by
Countis with a "billy "
Whittaker quickly arose to his feet
and Countis hred a couple of shots on
the ground, but near Whittaker's feet.
Whittaker then drew a gun and shot
Countis twice, the first shot striking
his nead and the second penetrating
B
the left side near the heart. Countis
leaves a wife and 5 children. The in
terrment took place at Cookeville.
Young Whittaker has not been appre
hended.
The board of mayor and aldermen of
Monterey, have offered a reward of
$50.00 for the body of Whittaker.
He belonges to the family of Whit
takers that have made much trouble
through dealing in illicit whiskey.
Members of the family have been un
der arrest as moonshiners and are gen
erally considered a dangerous set of
people.
W. B. Hamilton, of Harrmian, was
here on business Monday.
Mrs. Fred Cate and children visited
friends in Crab Orchard from Thurs
day to Sunday.
Mr. and Mrs. A. J. McGuire and Mr.
and Mrs. F. G. Walton went to Crab
Orchard Sunday and had a splendid
view from the mountain top.
Miss Antoinette Jackson assisted
Heed & Burnett during their spring
opening Monday and Tuesday.
Carlisle Toliett, who has been at

The Southard Lumber Company has
recently sold 100,000 railroad ties, the
larger part of which they expect to se
cure from a 3,000-acre tract of timber
recently purchased near Pleasant Hill.
The Southard company has mills and
men working on the tract now turning
out ties at a rapid rate. The ties will
be shipped from this point.
Nearly 140 head of hogs fattened in
the woods were purchased Saturday by
Arthur Woody for Nashville parties
and loaded here. The day of the famed
razor back hog is passed in this section,
in looking over the shipment Saturday
we were pleasantly surprised to see
the evidences of good blood. There
was a slight sprinkling ot the razor
back type, but he was very much in the
minority. His place has been .taken
by the Berkshire, Poland China, Duroc,
Essex and other good breeds. It used
to be thought, that the cutting of the
timber for railroad ties and staves
wouid practically destroy the acorn
crop until hogs would cease to be pro
fitable on the range, but that has
proven t he a mistake as the crop of
acorns grows larger than otherwise by
thinning out the timber. It bas been
estimated by persons well informed
that fully $30,000 has been realized
from hogs out ot the woods this year
and it is claimed that the raising of the
hogs did not entail a cash outlay of 50
cents a head. Many hogs that were so
fat as to be unable to walk, have been
hauled to market, and not a grain ot
corn had been fed to make them so ;
they had fattened on the acorns alone.
In this issue appears the announce
ment or Lin W. Martin as a candidate
for Tax Assessor, subject to the action
of the people at the August election.
Mr. Martin is so well known to our
people generally that we feel little
need of introducing him to the voters
of the county. There is, however, one
point on which Mr. Martin is particu
larly strong and we feel that the public
should be fully apprized of It; He is
especially well informed as to the val
ue of live stock, knows as well as any
man in the county who has live stock,
how many, what tools and machinery
he has, their value and is at the same
time well versed in the value ot land. 1
It is generally admitted that the coun-1
ty loses many dollars in taxes because ;
people fail to report their personal
property correctly, rar. Martin wouia
be able to overcome this omission to a
very great extent. That be would do
the fair and right thing, and do it fear
lessly, we fully believe. His well
known energy and business push fur
ther commend him as being a man who
would give bis best efforts to the duties
ot the office.
BI6 WAGE INCREASE.
Demand IS More
Railroads Claim the
Than Roads Can Stand.
Washington, D. C "The Railways
of toe Southeast are facing a critical
situation iu the proposed demands of
the Engineer's, Firemen's, Conduct
or's and Trainmen s Brotherhoods
which have joined in a nation-wide
j 8ttort to force the railways of ine
country to grant further wage conces
sions, which woula aud millions of
dollars to the payrolls of the railways
without enabling thsm to earn a cent
more than under present, conditions or
to in any way give better service to
the pubile," declares the Executive
Committee of the Southeastern Rail
ways in a statement given out recently.
"The demands ot the Brotherhoods
are generally referreu to as demands
lor an eight hour day and time and a
hail lor overtime, but tney are not in
reality for an eight hour day in the
sense in which that teim is commonly
understood, the statement continues.
' Ine employees are not asking that
they be relieved from service at the
end ot eight hours, as they realize that
this is not practicable in road service,
and the form in which the demands
have been made clearly shows this.
Thus the language of their own pro
posed demands is that on runs of one
hundred miles or less overtime will be
gin at the expiration of eight hours.
This simply means that if a freight
train requires, as it usually does, at
least 10 hours to run 100 miles, the
train and engine employees shall re
ceive their day's pay tor eight hours
of work and shall -eceive time and a
half for the two additional hours
"There is not a line in the proposals
concerning road service that in any
way limits the number of hours the
employees are to work, and their
proposition simply resolves itself into
fixing the period at which overtime
begins to acrue and after which they
shall receive time and a half insteaa of
the regular hourly rate.
"In a discussion of the proposed
demands in the official journal ot the
Trainmen s organization, the tollowing
explanation of the demands is given
by one of the vice-presidents of that
Brotherhood.
" 'There appears to be some differ
ence of opinion as to what such a pro
posal involves, therefore it may be sea
sonable to say that there is quite a
difference between an eight-hour work
day and an eight-hour basic work-day.
" 'The first contemplates that eight
hours shall be the maximum working
time, and as a rule where the eight-
hour work-day obtains through con
tract relations between employer and
employes, it is the contsant endeavor
to prevent working overtime except in
cases of necessity. It appears that
some of the men in the train service
are of the opinion that this is the
prupesal of the organizations. How
ever, this is not the case. The second,
the eight-hour basic work-day contem
plates that eight hours shall be the
basis for a day s work and any time in
excess thereof shall he paid for as
overtime, consequently under such a
provision there is no limit to the hours
worked. The latter system is the one
proposed by the train service Brother
hoods and is in accord with the action
taken by the delegates, at the Eleventh
Biennial Convention of the Brother
hood of Kailruad Trainmen. '
"The proposals of the employees,
as in reality formulated and officially
explained in the above citation, simply
mean that they shall be paid more
money than at present for the same
work they are now doing. The mat
ter, therefore, resolves itself primarily
into a question of wages and conse
quently of increased cost.
"Applying the proposed demands to
the present conditions of work would
mean an increase ranging from 12 to
40 per cent in cost, as the roads would
be compelled in mosc cases to con
tinue the present hours ot operations,
since changes to escape the payment ot
overtime would cause a higher percent
age ot increase than the tigares already
given.
"The railways of the Southeast are
in no condition to stand any increase
in their operating expenses, much lets
such increases as would result from
granting these demands. They
already pay higher wages to train aad
, engine employees than are paid in
'other sections of the country whera
I traffic is much more dense, and their
'have had no part in the rate increases
, which recently have been granted by
ine interstate commerce Commission
j to railways in other territories.
. "Preliminary estimates show that oa
i some lines the increases asked
j hy the employees would more than
wipe ot all income after payment f
operating expenses, fixed charges and
' taxes. The railways wou'd be forcep
either o secure increases in their ratea
or to lower their cost of operation by
curtailment of train service and rtduc
: ing the outlay for maintenance and im
provements necessary to meet the
transportation needs of the rapidly
developing southeastern territory.
"It is understood that the members
of the Brotherhoods have voted over
whelmingly in favor of the demanns,
and that announcement of the vote will
be made in a few days. This is
question in which the whole public haa
a direct and vital interest. The rail
ways of the Southeast merely ask of
the public that it inform itself of the
real nature of the proposed demands,
and of the ability of the roads to meat
them. ';

George T. Renfro was here yesterday
selling J. E. Burnett & Bons their fall
and winter stock of shoes known as
Dittman's Nine O'clock School shoes.
He was accompanied by Mrs . Nina
O'clock Barker, who is the advertising
representative of the Dittman Shoe

The demonstration will be held this
fall.
Miss Mabel Cram, whonas been here

Sunday Prof. Frank March cele
brated his forty-fifth birthday with a
dinner, the guests present were:
Rev. M. A. Martin, Prof. John Rose,
Miss Frances Waters and Miss Ethel
Jackson, of Harnman, aside from the
regular dormitory boarders. The
Thanksgiving bird was in evidence and
WW hi much the same condition after
the repast that the French army was
after the battle of Waterloo : There
was little left except the Bonaparte.
It is doubtful if the farmer of this
county fully realize the splendrl charce
they have for improving tboir borne
stock, for work, saddle and driving
purposes. The big Percheron horse
"Joseph W" that is owned by the
Crossville Horse Company, presents a
splendid chance tor improving our
work stock. "Fire King," owned by
Graham Melvin, Waldensia, ia a very
fine animal tor driving and saddle pur
poses and for our people to miss using
him is a great mistake. Many will
take advantage of the opportunity and
as a result of the presence of these two
nurses in the county there will soon be
marked evidences of great improve
ment in the quality of the horse stock
of this county. It is very encouraging
to note with what interest our farmers
are turning to blooded stock ot all
kinds, even to poultry. O. B. Rector
has as line a strain of Plymouth Rock
chickens as can ne found anywhere.
Other persons over the countv have the
same or other breeds of fowls that
come from ihe best pure bloods ot
their kind. Cumberland county cer
tainly is moving forward in all agri
cultural lines with gratifying rapidity.
Esq. U. S. Rose expects to have a
car of crushed lime rock here today for
delivery to farmers ot this section at
the rate of two tons to each man, on
payment of the freight alone. The
county furnishes the lime and has
authorized Mr. Rose to distribute it on
the basis named with the understand
ing that the two tons of lime is to be
used on not more than one acre of
ground and a report made to the court
as to the results obtained from its use.
Mrs. Leuisa Potter, who has been
