ELMER H. HENJUM.
On Tuesday of last week, March
14, the entire community became en
shrouded in a deep gloom of profound
sadness, when it was learned that the
most horrible and heart-rending
deed had been committed by Elmer
Henjum, whose lifeless body was
found by his brother, John, suspended
by a rope in an old cow barn.
He had been missing since some
time in the forenoon but no thoughts
were taken of his whereabouts until
his absence was conspicuous at the
dinner table. A search was made
with the above stated painful and
startling discovery. The shock to the
family can better be imagined than
described. No motive, whatever, is
known that might have prompted the
rash deed. He had not been in the
best of health during the last few
weeks, having complained of a head
ache which was aggravated consider
ably the previous Sunday when he re
ceived a seemingly slight injury un
der his right eye from a butt of a
cow's horn. Thinking this affected
his brain, Dr. Hanson of New London
was summoned, who upon examina
tion, found a slight hemmorhage on
same which was thought to have caus
ed the painful headache and might
have affected it otherwise though
nothing definite could be told then.
Deceased was born at the Hans
Henjum home in Town of Arctander
on Nov. 12, 1878, where he has very
faithfully spent the rest of his life.
He was of a rather quiet disposition,
though always cheerful. Always at
his post, never complaining in the
least. His devotion to the home, his
aged father and the rest of the fam
I lly was truly remarkable. What fat
al state of mind had overtaken him
will always remain a mystery.
The funeral took place on Friday at
the East Norway Lake church where
Rev. Sotendahl delivered a masterly
sermon to an audience that filled the
edifice to its entire capacity, on the
last verse of the 13th chapter of Mark
after which interment took place in
said cemetery.
The sympathy of the entire com
munity goes out to the bereaved fam
lly. May the blessing and comfort of
Him who is the source of all that's
to our good, descend to them in abund
I ance in this hour of affliction, and as
time rolls on may we look back upon
the past with a fuller realization and
better understanding of God's won
derful plans.—Contributed.

R. J. HALL WRITES
TWINE HISTORY
View of Yucatan Mooopoly
Recommends That Flax
Straw Be Tried.
On receipt of the letter which ap
pears on page seven, the editor ad*
dressed inquiries regarding the early
history of twine-making at the State'a
prison, especially regarding making
twine from flax straw, to a number ot
the leaders of the old-time Farmers'
Alliance. We have received the fol
lowing from Mr. R. J. Hall, of Morris,
who was president of the State Alli
ance at the time:
Morris, Minn., March 20, 1916.
Editor Willmar Tribune:
Dear Sir:
Replying to your letter of March 18,
my recollection is, that about twenty
five years ago, there was an effort
made by the Farmers' Alliance to have
the State manufacture twine at the
State Prison at Stillwater, and there
were a good many farmers who advo
cated that the twine be made from
flax straw or jute. I think: it was H.
E. Boen of Otter Tail county, then a
member of the Minnesota House of
Representatives, who introduced a
resolution in the House requesting the
Governor to investigate the twine in
dustry with a view of putting wn"*j^
ery in the Stillwater Prison.
Wm. R. Merriam was then Gover
nor. He appointed members of the
Prison board to go east and make the
investigation. In 1890 I was elected
President of the State Farmers' A nt.
ance and I, at once, undertook by cor
respondence to get information) as to
the twine industry. Mr. Joseph Todd
of New York, who owned a plant for
the manufacture of twine machinery
at Patterson, N. J., was the man I was
corresponding with.
On the return of the Prison board,
after visiting various manufacturing
plants of Chicago, Albany, N. Y., and
Philadelphia, they reported against
the manufacturing plant. Governor
Merriam forwarded' a copy of the re
port to me and requested me to criti
cize it. I wrote the Governor and
asked for a hearing, and told him I
wished to have the members of the
Prison board present as I wished to
criticize their report which claimed
.that it woulo cost featt & miBftonr-doll.
ars to start a twine plant, and that
the manufanrnring of twine was not
adapted to prison labor. I h.jj for.
warded a copy of this report to Mr.
Joseph Todd and asked him to write
me a letter that I could use publicly.
Mr. Todd in his reply stated that as
to the work not being adapted to
prison labor, if they were old and
decrepit, that might be true, but if
the prisoners were young and active
men who could handle fibre, move
cans from one machine to another,
and bale the balls of twine, they could
do the work. It did not require skill.
ed labor. As to the cost of the plant,
Mr. Todd offered to put in a system
of machinery that would manufacture
10,000 pounds of twine per day equal
to the sample he forwarded to me at
a cost to the state of $22,000. When
I finished reading this letter to the
Governor and the Prison board. GOT.
Merriam at once ordered a re-investi
gation and requested me to go and
help get the facts. The result was a
report favoring a twine plant but
when the machinery was purchased
by the Old Prison Board, they bought
imported machinery. They would not
purchase the Todd machinery.
The agitation of the question of
cheaper twine, and a twine plant at
Stillwater by members of the Farm
ers' Alliance resulted in the manufac
turing of twine at the Prison, and the
great success of that industry has led
to the manufacturing of farm machin
ery at Stillwater by the State, with
prison labor.
According to a report of the Board
of Control, the state has been reim
bursed all of the money it has ex
pended, and the manufacturing of
twine has resulted in a saving to the
farmers of the state of over two mil
lion dollars in the cost of twine. The
members of the Farmers' Alliance
were urged to stand loyally by the
twine plant, and this and the fact that
the state was furnishing a good qua£
ity of twine at a reasonable cost was
the reason the proposal to manufac
ture twine from flax straw was aban
doned.
The sudden raise in the cost of fibre
from Yucatan this year is not be
cause of a shortage in the fibre crop,
but is because of a combination that
can put the price up or down at their
pleasure.
It is time the question of mniring
twine from flax straw was investigat
ed, and if it is found that good twine
can be made—twine that can be used
in the self-binders—its manufacture
should commence at once. I have
written at some length because I be
lieve that, it is only by agitation and
public discussion of matters of public
interest that we get the people to act.
The Willmar Tribune can help.
Yours very truly,
R. J. HALL,
Vice President of the Farmers'
Home Mutual Tornado and O
