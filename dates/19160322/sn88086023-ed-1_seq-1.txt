Gentlemen:
Replying to yours of fhe 13th. We

be a very good one, however, and we
are not making this statement mere

the work later in a more direct way,
should we be called on to supply any
of the needed nursery stock. Many
cities are planting trees and shrubs In
their parks and streets. The syca-

very well adapted to such work, espec-
Lilly the sycamore, both

Since I came home from our meet

found out that the only road measure
that will have any chance of carrying

fore the people.
The people argue that the mlllage

at any one time, with which to accom
plish any permanent results They
argue that the money coming from u
mlllage tax would only amount to
1100.000 a year which would be spent
In patch work, and at the end of 14
years when our bonds would be dtie
wo would be In the same condition as

I am still of the opinion from what
I have learned from the people since
