London, March 21.-By what is
hailed in Berlin as the greatest gain
since the first days of the battle, the
Germans have driven forward to with
in two and one-half miles of the Ver
dun-Paris railway, main artery for
troops and ammunition supplying the
fortresses.
They officially claim to have stormed
the entire strongly fortified French
positions in and near the Forest of
Avocourt. southeast of Malancourt,
capturing thirty-two officers and 2.500
men and repulsing counter-attacks
with bloody losses to the French.
In this direction they have pushe

The new drive from the northwest
marks the opening of the second month
of the campaign against Verdun. The
Germans during that period have gained
from five to ten miles on all sides of
the fortress and have captured more than
30.000 prisoners and a large number of
cannon. Their losses, according to
French estimates, approximate 200,000.
though Berlin officially asserts that they

losses are about one-third of the Ger

More than 1.000,t0% men are engaged in

Special to The Wushington Herai.
New York, March 21-Th-Evening Post
publishes the following from David Law
rence. its correspondent in Washington:
Washington. March .1-Germany is
seeking to make peace with her enemies
and bring the great war in Europe to an
early end.
The imperial government has gone so
far as to intimate to the United States
government that the time may be ripe
for the services of the largest neutral
nation in the beginning of peace negotia
tions.
Some general idea even of the terms
under which the Teutonic empire would
be willing to make peace have been given
within the last four days to the Ameri
can Ambassador. Jamen W. Glerard. by
Dr. von Bethmann-Htollweg, the impe

of Emperor William.
The Evening Post's correspondent

State Department
Aid Was Soug
The State Department yesterday made
a flat categorical denial of the story
which hinted that Germany sought the
aid of the United States in launching
peace proposals. The State Department
said:
"First-That Germany has not intimated
to the United States that the time is
ripe for peace negotiations, nor suggested
that this is the opportune time for the
United States to renew its friendly

CAUSES CRISIS
Germany Passes Through
Critical Period of Internal
Political Combat.
CHANCELLOR WILL ASK
VOTE OF CONFIDENCE NOW
Kaiser's Spokesian Seems to Have
Won Over Majority of Reichstag
on U-Boat Question.
By AUGUSTUS F. BEACH.
Special Cable to The Washington HeniLd.
Berlin. March 20 (via The Hague, March
1.1--There is every indication today that
the victory of (hancellor von Bethmann
Holweg over Admiral von Tirpitz will
be maintained when the chancellor asks
for a vote of confidence by the Reich
stag. The plan now is that this vote
shall be taken on Wednesday after a set
speech by the chancellor.
There is a remote possibility that the
climax will be postponed, not later than
Friday.
For the last few days public opinion
has been divided, while behind the scenes
the political combat has been waged with
the utmost vigor. The situation at all
times has been serious.
Today, however, it is clear that the
preponderance of opinion is with the
chancellor and the emperor, and the war
will be prosecuted to the end under the
same administrative heads with the ex
ception, of course, that Admiral von Ca
pelle will be at the head of the navy.
Looks Beyond End of War.
Von Tirditz. since the beginning of the
war, has tried unceastigly to induce the
government to prosecute a ruthless sub
marine campaign against England. This
the chancellor was unwilling to do, be
cause he foresaw complications with neu
trals which would probably draw the
United States and other neutrals into
the war and would not only prolong the
conflict at the expense of Germany but,
after the war, would leave Germany with
out a friend or a trade connection on the
face of the globe.
In this attitude the chancellor was sup
ported by the most intelligent classes
and especially by the sttong business
interests which were looking to Germany's
commercial future as much as to the con
dict in progress.

Senate Decides That Govern

Costing $11,000,000.
FINAL VOTE IS 58 TO 23;
REED UPBRAIDS CORPORATION
M1easure Now Goes to House Where
Its Passage Is Considered
a Certainty.
The Senate passed a bill authorizing the
construction or purchase of a govern
ment armor plant at a cost of $11,000.0O0
yesterday afternoon. The vote was A
to "3.
Every Democratic Senator who voted
was recorded in favor of the new plan
of government ownership. The follow
ing Progressive Republicans also voted
for the bill: Borah, Clapp, Cummins,
Gronna, Kenyon, Norris, Poindexter,
Sterling and Works.
Senator R1eed, of Missouri, in course
of the debate, upbraided Senator Oliver,
of Pennsylvania, for possessing 1.O0
shares of United States Steel Corporation
stock, which, Mr. Reed averred, was
worth V50,000. Senator Oliver sought to
interrupt on a question of personal privi
lege, but Mr. Reed had the floor and
would not yield. Mr. Reed upbraided the
Steel Corporation for the alleged short
comings of "its subsidIary," the Beth
lehem Steel Company. Nobody tried to
correct Senator Reed because he would
not permit It, and perhaps they thought
it hardly worth the while.
By a vote of 47 to 33 the Senate refused
to direct the Secretary of the Navy to
enil in accountants to open a set of books
and keep a record of the expenses of
plans, site, construction and other ex
penses leading up to the establishment of
the government plant, and finally to re
port on the cost per ton of making armor
in a government plant.
Ashurs Attacks Weeks.
The Senate had determined to go
through with the government armor plant
and no price proposed for armor could
check them. Senator Hitchcock explained
that the government ought not to be
at the mercy of the armor makers.
Senator Ashurst closed the debate by
attacktng Senator Weeks and other
"presidential candidates" for defendIng
the "most outrageous monopoly in the
United States."

GEN. FUNSTON MAY BE UNEASY
!Troopers Rounded Up in Theaters of
Washington and Are Ready to
Go by Midnight.
By JOSEPH P. ANNIN.
Moving in three sections, the third
squadron and regimental headquarters of
the Fifth Ca valry are pulling out of Ross
lyn, Va., this morning, bound for Colum
bus, N. MrS.. and possibly the interior.
Along with the Twenty-fourth Infantry,
stationed in Wyoming, the Fifth was or
dered out at the request of Gen. Persh
ing. in command of the expeditionary
forces.
At 8 o'clock lst night, bound for the
theaters, movie houses and other bright
lights of the city, troopers of the Fifth
were still pouring across the Aqueduct
Bridge at Georgetown. pleasure bent and
without a thought of Mexico. By 8:30
o'clock olive drab messengers, mounted
on motorcycles, horses and in street cars.
were dashing rapidly through the famil
iar city haunts of soldiers, picketing thea
ters and movie houses, and spreading the
word to all that the regiment had been
placed under orders to move out immedi
ately.
Secrecy Surrounds Cause.
At midnight. the last of the odd jobs
incidental to the movement of a regi
ment had been wound up and troopers
had turned In to get what sleep they
could befor e 4 o'clock reveille. By 6
o'clock this mornirex, the ".rst section
of fifteen cars, bearing Troops I and
K. was pulling out. Absolute secrecy
as to the reazons for the move was
maintained by the War Department.
At a. late hour last night, many of
the officers were unaware of their
destination. And, although the War
Department knew of the projected
move early in the afternoon, the or
ders did not reach Fort Myer until
5:70 1). in.
From that time things were on the
jump. Had the orders been received
Immediately after the move was deter
mined upon, the Fifth could have en
trained before nightfall. Officers and
men have been packed up and ready to
load since a week ago Sunday. But
there was plenty of activity and sat
isfactory results, despite the handicap
of the dark. While it was not
thought wise to attempt to load the
horses in the dark, all wagons were
packed, full field equipment fastened
on saddles, commissary and guartermas
ter arrangements made, and every
thing prepared for an early start this
morning. Col. Wilder's orders were
that the post should be cleared by 5
o'clock.
The first and second squadrons of the
Fifth stationed at Fort Sheridan and Fort
Leavenworth, will Join the third squad
ron and headquarters en route to the
border.
Fuaston May Jie Uneasy.
A battalion of the Third Field Artillery
remains at Fort Myer. with Maj. McClos
key post commandant in the absence of
Col. Wilder. A squadron of cavalry from
Fort Ethan Allen has been ordered to
Fort Myer for garrison duty.
In view of Gen. Funston's statement
to the department last week that the
Fifth would not be called for unless ab
solutely necessary, the orders of yes
terday are taken to indicate at least
a pressing shortage of troops. The gen
erally accepted explanation was that Gen.
Funston is becotning uncomfortable be
cause 'of the concentration of Carranzista
troops between Pershing's column and
the border, so situated that the line of
communications can be cut at any time.
The call for the Twenty-fourth Infantry
is taken to indicate that infantry will
be used to strengthen the lines of com
municatIons in the event that the br'eak
reported last night is purely "wire
trouble," In the event that the lines
of communication-transport and mes
senger servioe--actually have been cut
by hostile Carransistas, the work of res
cue will devolve largely upon mounted
forces.
