Pursuing Villa.
Both Mexican and American
Soldiers Have. Orders to
Get Bandit Chief.
United Stuten troops are now
in Mexico pursuing Pancho
Villa, the Mexican bandit chief
who with a force of between
1.600 and 2,000 mull crossed in
to;Columbus, N. M., where he
kiIi<'ii ten civilians and seven
Ammicuti soldiers, after sotting
tire to the town. Citizens at?
tempting to escape from burn?
ing buildings worn shot by
snipers. With Villa's troops
was .Mrs. Maud llawko Wright,
wlm had been held captive by
Villa and who for nine days
had suffered terrible hardships
on the march of the bandits to
Columbus. The Mexicans had
killed her husband ami had al
so taken her baby. The latter
has been recovered.
Immediately after the raid.
Villa tied across the border and
was followed by a small detach
men! of American troops under
command of Major Krank
Totripkins. With .va ollicers
and men Major Tompkiiis chas?
ed '.100 Villa men for title >n
miles, killing T? of ihem and
siilTcring 110 casualties. He
w;is linally compelled to return
to the American side.
While lielieral Kreil K?nsten,
known as "Fighting Kreil,"'
will he in full command of the
expeditionary forces, the actual
lead will he under Brigadier
General J. ,f. Pershingi Both
of these ollicers have Seen ser?
vice in Cuba and in the Phillip.
pities.
Kirst Chief Cirran/.a has giv?
en bis consent to llio pursuit of
the bandits, ami President Wil?
son has itutiliod Oarranzu that
Mexican troops may cross into
American territory when n'ccCs
sary to chase outlaws. The or
tier has boon given to take Villa
dead or alive, and the troops
will make every 1 ll'ort to "giil"
him. Large rewards have heen
ottered for his capture by both
American and the Mexican
governments
The American force numbers
about 12,000, till branches of
llio serviee heilig represillted.
Arrangements have heen made
to replace 1I10 troops on the
border who have been dispatch?
ed to Mexico. People living on
the boundary line are fearful of
Mexican uprisings, as there are
more Mexicans than Americans
at several points.
Hundreds of Americans have
already reached safety on the
American side of the Bio
Grande. The large Smelting
and mining companies have
closet! down ami have advised
their employes to seid; refuge in
the United Slates. Many .Mex?
icans are also refugoeing to the
United States.
Although Oarrauza has con
sealed to the entry of American
troops into Mexico, Presidi hi
Wilson firmly giving as?
surance that the expedition is
stiicily for punitive purposes, ii
is feared disgruntled leaders
opposing t liirruuz 1 may attempt
to unite the Mexicans to resist
the Americans. The army of
invasion will therefore see thai
no hostile forces are in its rear
Oarrauza is said to have
changed hH cabinet so that he
may be a candidate for election
as president. It is known thill
many Mexicans oppose Carraii
/.a and they may incite opposi?
tion to the United Slates l>>
claiming that Oarrauza has no
right to allow American troops
oil Mexican soil. However, in
limes past, American troops
have crossed into Mexico in
pursuit of Indians, and Mexi-1
cans have also been allowed to
cross into this country when
chasing outlaws.
The greater part of the expo
ditiohury forces is made tip of
cavalry well supplied with
equipment necessary to cam?
paigning in a rough and semi
desert country. Mountain ,iiiiis
and aeroplanes win be used by
the Americans on 1 he campaign,
which it is feared may be a long
and aril nous one.
-Vt San Antonio and K.I Paso,
Texas, as well as at Columbus,
N. M., ami army stations in
Arizona, tliore is great military
activity and troop trains have
moved rapidly, bringing largo
quantities of supplies of all;
kinds to military bases. The

Governor
Stuart
Well Pleased Will? Work of
Recent Legislature.
Kiclnnond, Vd., March. 20.?
Summing tip ihe work of tin
recent session of the General
Aesembly, Governor Stuart ox
preciaos much saiisfactisn at the
emphatic endorseiiiont given to
tho segregation plan of taxa?
tion, at the laws passed looking
to uniformity in udministriition
of the assessment of property,
and is particularly pleased be
cause it was found possible to
provide a greater increase for
the public SCllOol8 in one year
than has been accorded in the
past ten years all put together,
l.arn?' majorities were given
to t In- hills intended to perfect
segregation. The hands of the
State Advisory Board on Taxa?
tion, now to be the State Tax
Hoard, have been strengthened.
A limit, both as to State and
local taxes, was put on the as?
sessment of intangible personal
property not heretofore gl veil
in by the owners, so that Hid
Operation of this law will bo
uniform and fair. The tax on
inheritances, the tax on manu?
facturers' capital, and on water,
heat, light and power com?
panies will give an equitable
and nee.|. c| revenue.
Schools benefit most of all,
for the increases aeeorded tlicit!
amount to $ilii2,t)?? in the first
year of segregation, ?5(52,00(l of
which conies from intangible
property which has never been
heretofore taxed.
The rale at which the State
gooa back on omitted iii
thngibicfi is less than the rate
now resting oh the same class
of property for tlld present and
future, und is a smaller burden
on intangibles Oltimillcd during
the the past t welve \ ears illUU
that which has actually been
paid on ii-a'. estate assessed at
one third of its value for lln
same period, Considering that
the lax on real estate was ae.
tuully paid year by year, where
as the seventy cents on the j loo
paid by the intangible owner
under the new arrangement
may be paid now without the
interest charge, which of nec?
essity has been running against
the citizen who has been pay?
ing his taxes as they accrued,
even though paid on property
greatly underassessed. It must
also be remembered that real
estate has paid regularly a State
and local tax not only back to
iflOU, but for and indefinite
period beyond that, au.I has
asked for and received no relief
as to any period.
Governor Stuart points out
that the 70 cent rate compared
with the rate paid on property
owned by estates, is less than
one third considering the inter
ast in taxes already paid. "It
is unbelievable," said the GpVi
erh?r, "that any man who has
failed to pay the tax due IIii
State and localities could coin
plain oi the just dumttud now
made upon him at a rate which
bears less harshly upon hi in
than any rale paid by any tax?
payer who met his obligations
as they accrued."
L. M. U; Defeats EWing.
Hubert Totter and Lilburn
I'M- enor went to Kwing Satur?
day to assist llui Kwing basi
hall team against llio Lincoln
Memorial University team, of
Cumberland Uup; T. mi., in
which they were badly defeat?
ed by a scorn of 11 to 2 The
defeat, was mostly due to the
good pitching of Holden, who
na I a tryout with the league
team at (his place last summer,
ill lowing the Kwing boys, barely
three hits, one of which was a
three base hit by Potter. Be
sides his invincible work in tin
box he featured at the bat, get.
ling three extra base clouts. A
southpaw started in the box
for tho L M. U. boys, but was
hit rather freely and had to re
tiro in favor of Holden, tticii
IllOIld was on the mound for
Kwing and was hit hard
throughout ihe game. How
ever the diamond was in bad
condition and the inflelders were
unuhlo to give proper support.

Kocoiirageil with the idea that

triumphantly elected, the party
workers took the view in to
day's conference that the situa?
tion gives promise of victory!
in this district, li was argued
that with a strong, determined
organization it would bo more
than possible to break Slump's
hold and elect a Democrat to

along this line were made by I
it. T. Irvine, lohn W. Chalkloy
and others. Resolutions were
adopted paying high tribute to

to the president's foreign policy
and his policy in dealing with
Mexico, and recommending a

would make an ideal candidate
from the standpoint of organi?
zation;
It was voted that a nomina?
tion for congress should hot bo
made until after tin- national
con volition.

They were immediately trans?
ferred id lilt) court bouse.one on
each side of the building, whore

came hopeless at that lime. Km
several days ho lay in a semi,
comatose condition and during
these trying hours Of care ami
anguish, his devoted wife neviii
left his bedside, waiting lor one
gleam of recognition before the
