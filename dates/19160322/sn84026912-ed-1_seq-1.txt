Worth Careful Thought
Do you read the label to know whether
your baking powder is made from cream
of tartar or, on the other hand, from alum
or phosphate ?
Royal Baking Powder is made from
cream of tartar, derived from grapes, and
adds to the food only wholesome qualities.
Other baking powders contain alum or
phosphate, both of mineral origin, and
used as substitutes for cream of tartar
because of their cheapness.
Never sacrifice quality and healthful
ness for low price.

WILL EXAMINE T. U. VAUGHN.
Thorough Test of Sanity Ul Ho Made
ut Hie State Hospital.
(The State, 20th.)
Thurston U. Vaughn, formerly su
perintendent Of the Odd Fellows' Or
phan Home at Greenville, who was
sentenced to death in 1012 for abus
ing a girl in his care, and who has
been in the State penitentiary most
of the time during the succeeding
four years, will likely be sent to thc
State Hospita] for the Insane shortly
in order that a determination may
be reached ?us lo whether he is in
sane. Vaughn at his trial made a
full and highly sensational confes
sion.
Last October Vaughn was taken to
Greenville to bo rosen te need, the Su
preme Court having denied Iiis appli
cation tor <a new trial, but his coun
sel procured a stay of execution,
pending inquiry into his sanity. Gov
ernor .Manning and Solicitor Bonham
have had the prisoner examined at
the penitentiary by J. Hcywnrd
Gibbes, ?VI. H., of Columbia, and So
licitor Bonlia'in has made public, let
ters received by him from Dr.
Gibbes and Governor Manning. Mr.
Bonham on the Governor's advice
will apply soon to the Circuit Court
for an order transferring Vaughn to
the asylum for observation. Dr.
Gibbes' letter to uhe Solicitor is, ill
part, as follows:
"Governor Manning and 1 did have
a conference concerning Thurston H.
Vaughn some time in January, and I
told him that in my opinion the fair
and just thing for the State to do
would be to commit him to the State
Hospital tor the Insane for a period
of some months so that the most ad
vantageous circumstances possible
could bc obtained for determining
his exact mental condition. This ad
vice wtas based upon the 'assumption
that the State was desirous of deter
mining the verity or falsity of
Vaughn's mental aberration, and not
concerning itself simply with the
problem of prosecution with the sole
idea of consummating his execution.
"My observations of Vaughn in the
peni teni ia ry have firmly established
in my mind the belief that every
phase of his condition can be ex
plained upon the basis of malinger
ing, and tihat the mental manifesta
tions which he presents do not accord
with any recognized type of mental
disorder. However, I feel that a
definite conclusion of this kind ls
scarcely 'warranted upon the basis
of examinations conducted in the en
vironment of a penitentiary, and it
was upon this feeling that 1 based
my advice to Mr. Manning.
"1 am glad to know that you are In
sympathy with these views. I am
sure that both you and I shall be
much better satisfied wltin the final
result of the case in spite of the tem
porary delay that this arrangement
necessitates.
"I shall ask Dr. Williams to let me
know as soon as Vaughn enters the
hospital for the insane, 'and shall
continue my investigations in con
nection with the physicians there "

age and had never married. These
bro fibers had never been separated,
had been together almost continu
ously all these years, and it is said
of them that they were never known
to speak a cross word or got thc
least out of patience.
"Uncle Staten" Cantrell had never
joined any church, but before his
death expressed lils desire to be bap
tized In the Catholic faith, and on
Monday a prlost baptized him.
These two devoted brothers wero

all reports brought to his desk, but
this had no hearing on his re-piest
for additional troops, he said. Tho
cutting ol' wires, south of 181 Paso
had not been reported to him elli
da I ly.
The request for more troops came
simply because Gen. Pershing has
lound it necessary to stretch his line
of communications so thin that u i
less reinforced soon, operations must
be restricted to a limited area.
The detachments of cavalry sent in
different directions south of Catfas
Grande? has made advisable the sta
tioning of troops nlong those lines to
support the mobile forces sweeping

the seven aviators selected for the
task ol' scouting for Villa, who is ex
pected lo scatter his bandits rather
than risk an engagement with che
American troops, who are said to bar
his way to the north.

almost impossible to capture him.
