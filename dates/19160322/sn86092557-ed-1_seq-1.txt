jority of the voters in favor of the

where the new roads would be built.

trict Is In fnvor of good roads and de
sires to help build good roads. Many
if the voters who were against tho
bond issue in its first form have said
that they would support another bond
issue if it Is prpearod In a more sat
isfactory manner to the entire dis
trict.

Trial of J. R. Linn
Begins in Court
ABSENCE OF IMPORTANT WIT
NESS WAS NOT PERMITED
TO STOP IT
Trial on the second indictment found
against James H. Linn was begun to
day in the Circuit Court before Judge
W S Haymond. This indictment is
the strongest one of the eleven found
against Linn at the last session of
the Grand Jury and Is practically the
same as the one in which issue was
joined at the previous term ot court.
The state's attorneys this morning ap
peared to ileslre a speedy trial and
the defense Imposed no objections. The
list of witnesses summoned by the de
fendant was called and one of the prin
cipal ones, Harry F. Smith, of the
Simth-Race Grocery company was not
present. It is thought ihit Simth left
the city Monday with the intention of
going to Oklahoma. A rule was Usued
by Judge Haymond this morning to en
force the presence of Smith. J. A.
Meredith and W. S. Meredith, attor
neys for tbo dofendant, asked for a
continuance of the case cn the ground
tbat Smith was an important witness
for their defendant. An affidavit to
this effect was Bled by the defense.
Walter Haggorty and Tusca Morris,
attorneys for the. state, argued that
the defense had had sufficient time
to prepare their case as this indict
ment was practically the same as the
one In the previous case which was
continued from the last tenn of court.
Two affidavits were filed by the
state'H attorneys to secure an immedi
ate trial and the arguments on both,
sides of the motion to continue, con
sumed the bettor part of the after
noon. Judge Haymond finally grant
ed the defense a few days' delay dur
ing the present term to secure their
important witnesses. It Is likely that
an early date will be decided upon by
a conference of the attorneys on each
side and that the trial will be complet
ed at this term.
Other important witnesses for the
state and defense were also absent
but had received notice, of tliolr sum
mons and will he present as needed.
John. A. Clark, one Qt the witnesses
summoned by the defendant will re
turn to Falrmont.the latter part of. the
^hTMi |T *'* n tome
up as soon as the'Linn care ts dispos
ed ot and the result of the Linn trial
Will' determine to a great extent the
action the indictments- against Race.
Both Race and Linn were, present in
the crowded court room today and each
appeared confident and- hopeful.
