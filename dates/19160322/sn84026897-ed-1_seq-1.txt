A splendid meeting: of the W.

4 the New Century club on Tuesday
afternoon with Mrs. W. P. Cas
sells and many points of interest
pertinent tu club welfare were dis-i
cussed. One was the free library.
The club has on hand about two
hundred volumes, but they hope to
increase this to be more instructive
for the members and for the use of
the general public. They have the
promised co-operation of the other
organization?. The patriotic organi
' zations will supply books of this
nature. The VV. C. T. U. eau put

all business Miss Mallie Waters
took charge of the lesson study

occupying the time. "One hundred
years ago, when a woman wrote a
book men applauded her as they
would a dancing bear, not because

no branch of literature which she
does not adorn," so says Foster.

Southern Bestows Medals Upon
Faithful Employees.
. Washington, D. C., March 17.
One thousand, seven hundred and
fifty-eight men in the employ of
of Southern Railway Comoany,
representing all ranks and all classes
from general officei to blacksmith
helper, who have exceeded twenty
five.years of continuous service on
the road, will shortly be awarded
a medal by President Fairfax Har
rison in recognition of their achieve
ment and to commemorate their
honorable record. The presenta
tion of the medals will be made per
sonally by Mr. Harrison to all those
entitled to them during the next
two weeks. In announcing the
plan, the following statement was
issued b" President Harrison:
"Southern Railway Company has
in its service 1,758 men of all ranks
and classes, from general officer to
blacksmith helper, who have ex
ceeded twenty-five years of contin
uous service on the road. There
are, indeed, thirty-four men who
have exceeded fifty years of such
service, and it is also of interest
j that there are 235 negroes on the
list. These men are best men the
Company carries on its rolls, for
they have proven their loyalty and
their fitness for tlnir several respon
sibilities in thb hard school of ex
perience and by survival of the
strict discipline which is necessary
in the administration of a railroad.
To recognize their achievement and
to commemorate their honorable
record, the Company has arranged
to award each one of them a medal
which they can wear so long as they
live and hand down aj an heirloom
of'their families."
The medal is of bronze, of highly
artistic and successfal design. It is
the work of the distinguished sculp
tor Victor Brenner of New York, j
who wat< recommended to the Com-)
pany by the United Stater Direc
tor of the Mint. -The artist is best
known, perhaps, for his design of i
the current Lincoln penny.
The obverse of the medal bears
the inscription "Southern Railway
Company. For Loyalty," and shows
an actual scene on the road, a sec
tion of modern double track equip
ped with automatic signals, with
an all steel passeuger train running
through the mountains of North
Georgia. President Harrison's plan
was to show a typical industrial ;
scene with a factory in the back- i
ground, but the sculptor would not
agree that a factory was capable
of artistic treatment and insisted
on mountains. It is, however, for
tunate for the Company and for
those who will wear the medals that
there are factories on line as well
as scenery.
The reverse of the medal shows
three symbols of modern railroad
ing: a telephone dispatcher at his
switch-board, a section gang en
gaged in maintenance and a large
heavy-power press to represent the
shop crafts. Thus each principal
branch of the service is indicated.
On the reverse is also engraved the
name of the man to whom the
medal is awarded, with the dates
of his service record.
mingling of friends the hostess
served a tempting repast.
Miss Sara Stevens who is teach
ing at McCormick spent Saturday
and Sunday here at her home, hav
ing attended the teacher's convention

The Angeline Bacon chapter, D.

ing on Saturday afternnoon with
Misses Sadie Lee and Jamie Bruce,
Miss Jessie Edwards conducting the
meeting. There were two new mem
bers gained, Misses Caro bel Ste
vens and Leola Moifett. Miss Fran
ces Turner, historian had an inter
esting program arranged and the
meeting proved very interesting.
While chatting and making plans
for an Easter party and a camping
party during tie summer days all
enjoyed delightful refreshments

Dear Old Advertiser:
We people of Cl eora are so ranch
elated over the good work being
done around here by the ehaingang,
with Capt. Barrett in charge, that
we are just obliged to whoop up
our town a little bit. Capt. Bar
rett, with his genial smile and ac
commodating disposition, has won
the friendship of all our people, lt
is being said that he is doing more
and better work, with less fuss and
less help than has ever been done
in this section before. Yes, and
Charlie Broadwater, the Old Rock
of Gibraltar, stands pat and is god
father for the whole crew.
Now, Mr. Editor, we want you to
get in your new six-forty Paige car
and come up to see us, taking a spin
up Bartley street to Cleora, clown
McClendon street to Williams street,
then to Red Land farm. Then take
down Bruuson street to the Vienna
road and back to Cleora through
Reel's Southside avenue and if this
fails to make you smile, I will pay
the fiddler.
Now, if the supervisor wants to
complete the happiness of all of the
people of this burg, just let him
put Capt. Barrett and his gang on
Morgan street. This is a new street
and road leading from Cleora to
Berea church. We are not expect
ing that this road be put in thorough
repair at this time buta few days
work on it now would give us a
better way to get to Berea church
and would be highly appreciated by
us all.
Mr. Editoi, just let rae speak of a
few more things and 1 am done for
this time. You know we can boa*?-.
^tne largest country store in the
county, if not in the State, run by
men of a high order of business
qualities. They put on a bargain;
sale some time ago and you can bet
that our town has been thronged
with people from far and near, car
rying off bargains by the armful,
by buggy loads and wagon loads.
You see, when Albert Reel, one of
the best business boys in the coun
ty, puts a cut price on an article
you may be sure it is down. Yes,
down below zero and you safely
take it in.
Furthermore, we have got one of ?
the best hors? shoers and wheel
wrights to be found anywhere. So
if your horse's feet need a doctor,
or your wagon or buggy goes
crazy, just bring them to Doolit
tle's asylum at Cleora. He stands
at his forge ready and willing to
make you .hapy.V.
Brunson school is progressing
finely under the guidance of two of
the best teachers to be found any
where, Miss Sara Stevens and Miss
Carrie Collins. They have 50 pu
pils, all of whom are sound and
healthy, without a single defect of
any kind.
Grain is looking fairly well around
here, but I hear some complaint of
the fly being in it. More diversifi
cation is being practiced by our
farmers than was ever known be
fore and less guano is being used
than ever.

^Better say nothing, than noth

Seeing facts as they present them
selves, as we read of current events,
andifche progress of science, brought
abo? by the development of our
rajBces, the demand upon us as a
peowe makes us feel that no time
should he lost on all lines of educa
tion*; How can anybody say "they
haV&ho part" in that which is for
the Stterment of mankind. Some
say,*what is done at Washington
does-not come before me and mine."
Why,not? Each family despite its
huin?ieness, helps rorud the nura
bers.pf this great nation. So no
maher the position in life, our
greatest asset is the children of our
land.f* To our mind the foundation
workftegins at the fireside. Dis
cuss Wfi business world and its do
ings-filth the children, teach them
by heaping thuin to see the right
and r?srxmg of affairs. True patriot
ism isi'keeping ourselves spiritually
and intelle-jtually informed. Tile
yoanjf should be encouraged to
equip^themselves to encounter the
great?robleais which progress of
time r?ill advance. Life is full of
perpemies and grows as time ad
vanoej?, To keep anywhere in ad
vancer can be done, only by an
education, and a trust, in Him who
rules over all. Comts to my mind
right here, an incident of my child
hood: A young man of bright
ideahvbut of poor parentage said,
"I desire above riches, an educa
tioii/' ij! father to encourage bim
said, * you have a dic tionary, study
that, ao?read your Bible to keep
.you. V-Wk'&J i* voa trv< ;vaui
will succeed." Those were words of
encourageaient, so expressed to me
few years ago, the person having
reached to sucess as a business man
and a man of usefulness. To keep
good company is a means of educa
tion. Some writer bas made this
assertion. "To keep bad company
is like playing with dirt, some is
sure to stick to you."
On the 11th inst., near Modoc
the unidentified body of a young
man with one foot severed entirely
just above the shoe the other limb
at the hip almost from the body and
an ugly gash in forehead was found
by engineer early freight going
down. The railroad officials had
inquest over the body, and upon
examination, decided the killing
was accidental. In the shoe on the
severed foot was foilnd some money
both silver and bills so crushed that
could not determine the amount,
also a telegram in his coat pocket
from Centrai S. C., to Augusta,
Ga., by name Wiley McCalliban.
Soon the railroad wai in communi
cation with the unfortunate family.
In meantime the body was arranged
for burial, the good people of
Modoc rendering assistance, feeling
that it must be done orderly, say
ing it waa 'some mother's boy."
A brother came the next day and
carried the remains to Central. The
father was ill, hence the telegram,
but died day of accident.
Our farmers are busy now. Some
are using guano, bat not much.
The timely waruing of National
President of Farmers Union should
be, food for thought, for the entire

Court of Common Pleas.
At the time of our going to press
last week the court was engaged
with the suit brought by Dr. J. R.
Timmerman against Mr. 0. 0. Po
sey to recover 28 acres of land and
damages, the sum of $1,000 being
involved. A verdict was rendered
in favor of the plaintiff, restoring
to him the 23 acres of land and
awarding damages to the amount of
$25.
The case that has attracted most
attention since the convening of the
court oTtftfrnmon pleas was the suit
brought by Mr. John 0. Scott
against the Georgia-Carolina Power
Company for $2,500 damages. Mr.
Scott alleged that the impounded
water resulting from the dam which
the Georgia-carolina Power Com
pany constructed across Savannah
river has caused a stream near his
home to overflow and that has
created sickness in his family, and
because of this damage to his prop
erty and meuace to the health of
his family he sought redress in the
courts.
The testimony in the case was com
pleted Saturday, and Monday morn
ing the sheriff, following the order
of the court, secured four automo
biles and carried the jury down to
view the property in order that
they may act more intelligently.
After being in the roora several
hours the jury rendered a verdict
Tuesday afternoon for $500 in fa
vor of Mr. Scott. The plaintiff was
represented by J. Wra. Thurmond
and B. E. Nicholson and the de
fendant by Sheppard Bros, Elliot
and Herbert of Columbia and Boy
kin Wright of Augusta.
The next case called Tuesday was
similar to the abovf, being a suit
for damages in the sum of $10 ,200
against the Georgia-Carolina Power
Company by Mr. Walter Cheatham.
The jury will be taken in automo
biles to view the property Thurs
day. There are about 16 other cases
against the Georgia.-Caroliua Power
Company but these were continued
to the next term of court. As the
suit of Mr. Cheatham will be the
last for this term, all petit jurors
except those drawn on this case
were discharged Tuesday afternoon.

Sunday was a lovely soring day,
warra, bright and very little wind
in comparison with what we have
been having. We have h id more
wind and harder wind this season
than for years it seems tn me The
trees ought surely to gn?w well af
ter such work as the wind bas given
them.
We wpre truly sorry to hear of
the extreme illness of little James
McClain, son of Mr. and Mrs. Mc
Clain, Sr., who have recently moved
to the Cooper neighborhood. He
bas pneumonia and was taken to bis
aunt's Mrs. Will Walker's to be
treated by Dr. Moore, the child
specialist. We hope to hear to-day
L? his being much better.
Glad to see Mrs. Luther Reese ap
again after her severe spell of chills,
she and Miss Georgia R^e.*e. Mrs.
Reese spent a few days with her
sister, Mrs. Gertie Shaw, hoping to
gain some strength and get rid of
some of the malaria. She certainly
shows what malaria has done for
her. She guarantees us a fall sap
ply of malaria if we will come spend
one night with her. Of coarse we
promised not to come.
We are glad to report that we
have just beard that little James
McClain is a little better, his fever
being less this morning.
Miss Mary Towues left this morn
ing for Shelton, S. C., where she
will take a school for a short term.
Last Tuesday the equalization
board of Meriwether township met
at Mr. John Scott's and we were in
vited to spend the dav also with
the ladies. Mrs. Scott and Alisa Ines
'have their cousins, a bright' pretty
young lady from Grovetown, Ga.,
Miss Nina Blackstone, visiting
there, also the teacher a sweet little
creature Miss Kitty Link. Mrs. H.
F. Cooper and Miss Lilla Bunch,
Herbert Bunch, Mr. H. F. Cooper,
Mr. Wiley Glover, Mr. Will Far
ris and Mr. Eu Spires were all there
to dine that day, and enjoyed the
entire day with Mr. Scott's hospita
ble family.
Since Miss Irene Scott married
we have lost our organist at Har
dy's, and we missed her Sunday
very much as no one else would play
j for us. There were not so many oat
i as should have been as pretty a day
j as it was. There was a fairly good
attendance at Sunday school at
Sweetwater we were told, and after
it was over the young folks motor
ed to Augusta for a joy ride.
We were very sorry to Lear of
Mrs. T. J. Briggs being so sick.
Hope she will soon be up again and
be able to attend the missionary
meeting which will be at Hardy's
church, owing to Mrs. Townes not
being at home. Sorry to hear Mr.
Will Briggs is not at all well.
