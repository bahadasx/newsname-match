North Star College, as it marked the
close of a year's campaign to raise
$36,000 for paying the indebtedness
on the new college building. A year
ago, Rev. F. N. Anderson obtained a
written promise from Hon. James J.
Hill, of St Paul, to the effect that he
would donate $9,000 toward paying
the debt, if the remaining $27,000 be
raised by the college in other ways
on or before March 18, 1916. A
campaign was immediately started
with a view of raising the $27,000 re
quired to meet the conditions of Mr.
Hill's generous offer. Rev. F. N.
Anderson was placed in charge of the
work as field secretary and has de
voted most of his time since then to
soliciting funds A committee was
appointed by the Warren Commer
cial Club to assist Rev Anderson in
canvassing the citv for funds This
committee consisted of O. Taral

and Aug A Johnson, and thru their
efforts $8,000 was raised in a few

CORN OF 100 PER CENT
GERMINATION RAISED HERE.
The Spaulding farm has just made
a germination test of some seed
rorn of the Northwestern Dent var
iety, raised on the farm last year,
and the result showed a germination
of 100 per cent. The field of corn
that this was gathered from got ripe
and made over 50 bushels to the acre.
It is a well known fact that Northern
Minnesota is becoming a corn
country, and we believe that it will
not be manys years until each farm
will have its corn crib, the same as
the states farther south.
Wee have seen a great deal in the
papers this winter about the
scarcity of seed corn all over the
country and the low germination test
of what was offered for sale. In
fact, most of the corn in the great
corn growing states was nipped by
the early frost last fall The fact

SHORT COURSE
WAT A SUCCESS
Able Instructors Discuss Live Sub-
jects in a Practical Way. Great
Interest was Manifest.
The Farmers' Short Course last
week, although not as well attended
as it should have been, nevertheless
made up in interest and valuable
practical work for what was lacking
in numbers. The speakers provided
by the state are experts in their lines
and the information disseminated is
sure to bring results Mr Lathrop,
Mr. Bower and Mr. McCall discussed
subjects pertaining to farm manage
ment, stock raising, horticulture and
other subjects, while Miss Rowe by
her lectures and demonstration work
gave the ladies something useful to
thing about.
On Saturday afternoon Dr J. H.
Worst, former president of the N. D.
Agricultural College, delivered a
splendid address on economy.
One practical result of the short
course was the organization of a
cow testing association, of which C.
Spaulding was chosen president.
The association will employ an ex
nerienced man to go from farm to
farm making tests of milk for but
ter fat and keep records of feed con
sumed with a view of weeding out
unprofitable cows Twenty farmers
signed as members of the associa
tion, their names and the number of
cows owned by each being as follows*
