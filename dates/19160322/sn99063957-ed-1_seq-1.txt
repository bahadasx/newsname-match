Supposed Bandits Have Cut
Wires, and Wireless Is Out
J cf Communication
REPORTED VILLA HAS
FLED TO MOUNTAINS
Texas Rangers Round Up
Villa Sympathizers Who
Send Him Munitions
i:i Paso, Texas, Mar. 22. All efforts
to get in communication with General
J, Pershing's American columns failed
early today. The field telegraph. Cut
in 2S places, and the light wireless
outfit carried by tho expedition both
luoved useless. It is believed certain
that tho wire was cut by roving bandits
or Villa sympathizers who got between
the Americnins and the border. The ex
ait trouble with the wireless has not
been ascertained, but efforts are stili
being made at army headquarters to
communicate with the expedition by
radio.
(ieneral Gnvirn at Juarez made an ef
fort to get in touch with the column by
using the railroad wire to Casas Gran
iles. This also failed. It is supposed
the line was broken by bandits in a
raid on railway communications. No
word of the amount of damage done
was to be had, however, constitutional
ist officials protesting ignorance.
Meanwhile, somewnere deep in Mex
ico behind this curtain of silence the
American are supposedly pursuing
their task of running down Francisco
Villa and his men. There is a report
current here that Villa . himself has not
participated in any fighting yet, the
conclusion being that. he. left it to
some of his followers, while he himself
hurried toward one of . his lurking
places in the inountiuns. If it is true
that Villa wan present at the skirmish
ing around Kamiquipn, army men be
lieve it reasonable to suppose that he
and his men have already clashed with
the Americans somewhere in that re
gion. At last accounls, before communica
tions failed, the expedition vanguard
was only Ho miles from Namiquipa.
Should it have come 'face to face with
"I'nncho" nnd his outlaws those who
know Villa believes he would have split
his army into many small bodies and
would have spread out in all directions,
making the American forces divide into
groups nnd fight him guerilla fashion.
CaiTanza Troops Unreliable.
Border reports today stili had it that
there was moro or less serious-disaffection
among sumo of Onrranzn's troops.
While fnilli wns manifested in C'arranza
many doubted his army would obey him
in all things. American women, wives
of officers, schol teachers and others
who live in smnll towns around El Taso
have come here so a, o be on the safe
side in case of a break.
Texas rangers are rounding up all
border Mexicans suspected of being Vil
la sympathizers. Many of the suspects
have admittedly been" engaged in ship
ping ammunition across the Rio Grande.

EAST NASHVILLE FIRE

MAY WIPE OUT CITY
Nashville, Tenn., Mar. 22.
East Nashville, including some
of the finest residences, is
threatened with destruction by
fire this afternoon. The blaze
originated in a negro's cabin.
Over 20 houses have been burn
ed, and two blocks razed. The
fire department appears pow
erless. Outside aid has tieea
asked. 'High winds are spread
ing the flames.
The early damage was confin
ed mostly to shacks and a few
cheap buildings,! but insurance
experts said that even if the
wind should cease 15,000 would
be made homeless.
N'nshville, Tenn., Mar. 22. Although
every available piece of fire fighting
apparatus in Nashville and adjoining
eilies was battling tiie flames sweep
ing East Nashville this afternoon, the
blaze continued to gain. Governor Tom
('. Rye called out state militia to aid
police and firemen.
At 4 p. m. tiie conflagration showed
no signs of nbatin;;. Only tiie Cumber
land river, separating tho business dis
trict from the portion now wrapped in
flames can save the whole city from de
struction, it is feared.
Neighboring cities even some dis
tance away are sending engines on spe
cial trains, but every dydraut is busy
now, and the additional apparatus will
be of little use.
Traveling with terrifying speed, the
flames have already eaten a pathway
three blocks wide and a mile long
through the heart of the best residence
district. Three churches were engulfed
in the fire.
Market Was Stagnant
Prices Took a Tumble
New York, Mar. 22 The New York
Evening Sun's financial review today
said :
Trices were irregular and uncertain
during the first three hours, but during
that, perioil Reactionary tendencies pre-1
dominated. Peace discussions contin
ued to make their influence felt.
Tiie heavy opening wherein war stocks
lost ground was clearly the result of
overnight reports that Germany had in
timated the time for pence negotiations
had arrived. Despite the state depart-!
nient s denial the wide circulation or
these rumors confused the public, and
restrained trading.
The extreme narrowness of the mar
ket was indicated by such declines as
10 points in General Motors, fifteen in
liethlehem Steel and the almost com
plete neglect of railways. Coppers were
mostly dull. Mercantile Marine pre
ferred was the only conspicuously
strong stock this forenoon. I. ate trad

of business, and speculative conditions
remained unchanged.

Paris, Texas, Mar. 22. Threo
arc dead, 10,000 homeless and
from $7,000,000 to $10,000,000
damage has been caused by a
fire which devastated two
thirds of the city. The flames
were finally extinguished to
any. One hundred business blocks
were destroyed including 25
dynamited to checlt the blaze.
Between 1,500 and 2,000 dwell
ings were burned. Many were
injured, some probably fatally.
Tour are known dead. The
body of James Rector was
found buried in the wreckage of
his home at Monon. At Mont
pelier, Gertrude Alspneh, aged
4, was killed.
Paris, Texas, Mar. 22. With two
thirds of the city's residential and
business districts wiped out by 'flames
which left a funnel shaped wake from
two to 10 blocks wide across the city,
the total loss as the result of the fire
which raged all night was estimated
today from $2,000,000 to $.'!,000,000,
with 10,000 homeless. One man, John
Straub, was burned to death in his
home.
Homeless and destitute families are
being relieved by the crty. Half the
population of Furis is without shelter.
Thousands went without breakfast this
morning. Urgent appeals for groceries
and money have been sent to neigh
boring cities.
There is not a dry goods store, drug
store, hotel or wholesale grocery left in
the city. Among the buildings destroyed
were two newspaper plants, the court
house, postoffice, Telegraph office,
high school, three churches, scVerall
apartment houses, two hotels and many
costlv dwellings.
The fire started in the Long Trans
portation company warehouse and
spread with great rapidity to the Paris
Cotton compress. While thousands 'fled
from their homes, throwing furniture
and valuables into the street, the blaze
swept over the public square and ate
into the north side residence district.
Tire fighting apparatus was rushed
from Dallas, Honey Grove, Bonham and
from Hugo, Okla. Every citizen wns
pressed into service. Many bucket bri
gades were formed. The water supply
was none too plentiful, nnd at midnight
the fire had taken a:! but 15 of the
citv's 140 business blocks.

and look "new"
Travelers who have seen the fight
ing men of Europe, passing through
camps of the "new" army, place it on
a par if not above any army now at
war. But every one of these observers
remark upon the insignificance of the
force.
"A wonderful mnchtne," they say,
"but hopelessly small."
Residents of these border places take
a similar view of the situation. They
appreciate the fighting quality of the
men. but have a fear of Mexico which
an adequate army they say would allev
iate. Judge A. A. Richardson, legal repre
sentative for the de facto government
of Mcxico,( an American who learned
the Mexican language before he master
ed English, declared that it took him
40 vears to learn the Mexican eharne
ter, to find only when war came that
he did not know it at all.
"I am afraid for our boys down
theref" he said, "when the first blood
is shed, American also will learn thej
Mexican character."
GREAT FIRE IN KANSAS
Kansas City, yo., Mar. 22.
Prairie fires driven by strong
winds did heavy damage in
Kansas today. The Cushing oil
field reported more than $1,-
000,00 loss there alone.
Reports from Wichita said
flames were sweeping over miles
of grass lands, killing livestock
and destroying farm build-
ings.
No casualties have been re-
corded.
Are Needed to Guard Lines of
Communication With
Armies In Mexico
Washington. Mar. 22. From all sec
tions of tho United States troops sped
to the border today in instant response
to Major General Fred Funston's ap
peal for reinforcements.
At 4 a. in. Colonel Wilder and four
troops of the Fifth cavalry from Fort
Meyer, across the Potomac from Wash
ington, started for Columbus, N. M. on
a special train.
Squadrons will be en route to the bor
der from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas;
Fort Sheridan, III., and Fort D. A.
Russell, Wyo., this afternoon.
Funston 's latest dispatches indicated
that (ieneral Pershing was nearing the
Villista fighting line. Reports that
Pershing's communications ha J beea
cut were disturbing, though the break
was believed due to military difficul
ties rather than to treachery.
More supplies are being urged for
Pershing. Officials admitted that if
they diii not reach him in a few days
the condition might become serious.
The stato department and Carranzis
ta representatives are rushing work on
the protocol under which further oper
ations in Mexico are to be conducted.
Its essential features have been agreed
upon, nnd the u'f.iil are now beijig
worked out. '
May Raid In Army's Rear.
San Antonio. Tex., Mar. 22. With
General Pershing's men reported at
Lake Babricosa, Colonel Dodd betwen
El V.ille and Namiquipa and a third
American column near Carmen, contact
with Francisco Villa was regarded as
inevitable today, if the bandit is still
hemmed in between the fast moving ex
peditionary force and Carranzistas to
the southward.
If Villa has given them the slip and
won his goal in the Guerrero fastness,
it is conceded the chase will last weeks
and perhaps months.
The significance of Major General
Fred Funston's e ill for reinforcements
was admittedly due to a necessity of
strengthening the American lines of
communication. Army men tear vn
listas may have been purposely left be
hind when their leader fled, suddenly
to raid in Pershing's rear and leave
the Americans isolated in a pro-Villa
district.
Extension of the censorship to El
Paso was hinted if Carranza permits
use of Mexican railways for military
purposes. The American base may then
be transferred from Columbus to El
Paso.
Pneumonia Thins Ranks.
El Pasi, Tex., Mar. 22. Sickness is
thinning the American ranks in Mexico.
Several soldiers arrived here for
treatment today. They said soldiers are
dropping most from pneumonia. By day
they suffer from intense heat. At night
they almost freeze. This, say the ar
rivals, has produced a pneumonia epi
demic of serious proportions.
A week's hard marching on meagre
rations from following months of hearty
feeding in camps caused many to fall
by the wayside. The worst cases are
being sent back to the border.
Private K. J. Harding, Company A,
Sixtenth infantry said pneumonia was
the most prevalent complaint.

The rescue scene wns dramatic. For

Her parents had sworn that sho was
at home on those dates, (lertrudo her
self testified she visited the Sluughtor

Mrs. Whiilden fixed the dates of Ger

so a member of Slaughter's congrega
tion, came on those dates, to give her
a sponge bath as she was sick in bed.
Gertrude heated the water and aided
Mrs. Grein, she testified.
Judge Gregory strongly admonished
Defense Attorney Schooler for asking
alleged insulting questions. Schooler
asked Mrs. Whidden if she remembered

Whidden 's husband threatened to
"have a settlement" witii Schooler.
Mrs. Whidden was so overcome she

(United Press staff correspondent.)
London, Mar, 22. Liquid fire playeil
its most successful role since the war
began when it enabled German troops
to make an advance at a point 10 miles
northeast of Verdun.
Reports received in London today
said that German artillery showered
shrapnel and high explosives on the
French positions in tho Avoeourt wood
without success. But jets of liquid flam
and billows of smoke drove the French,
from several hundred yards of trenches
southeast of Malancourt,
This now success menaced nevcrat
sqnaro miles of French positions north
west of Verdun. Latest Paris dispatches
however, insist that the shifting Ger
man attack is n confession of failure.
Russian victories have convinced P
critics that the Vcraun offensive will
soon be abandoned.
By their gain at Avoeourt. the Ger
mans arrived within seven miles of the
St. Menehould railway, over which sup
plies are carried for most o'f the French
positions around Verdun. If the (!o--mans
fail to squeeze the French out

may suddenly change front and smnMi
