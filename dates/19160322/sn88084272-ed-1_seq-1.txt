th.it the tracks are so laid as to leave
too little space on tho north side for

CRUISER TI0.S.
The United States Cruiser
Brooklyn Will Convoy the
Cormorant From Guam.
Washington. D. C, March 22. The
United States cruiser Brooklyn, which
sailed from Manila last Thursday is due
to arrive at Guam, Samoan Islands, to
dny from which port, it Is understood,
she will convoy to San Francisco the
German cruiser' Cormorant which sought
refuge there when she was pursued by
a Japanese warship some months ago.
The Brooklyn left Manila under sealed
orders and her destination had been the
subject of more or less conjecture.
During the flight the Cormorant's
crew tore up the wooden dock floors for
fuel and the exposed iron radiated so
much heat that several of them devel
oped symptoms of Insanity.
After the
Cormorant had interned at Guam it be-
came apparent that the extreme tropical
heat and necessary restrictions imposed
made living conditions aboard the ves
sel unsatisfactory for the crew.
As a result, it was decided by the
naval authorities to bring the Cormo
rant and her crew to the United States.

e:
Ii PASO, since the announcement of
battle In progress on Monday
evening between the Yilhstas and
Carrancistas at Namlquipa has been on
the alert to learn whether or not the
American troops forming the column
under CoL G. A. Dodd were anywhere
near Namlquipa when the engagement
is supposed to have occurred; and if he
was near, what part that Intrepid colo
nol and his command may have had in
the combat.
If there have been any developments
of an adverse character against the
Carrancistas. that fa has not been
permitted to reach, the American side.
If there bad been JWiyceejs, It is cer
tain that It W0uld-.hjp.ben heralded

problem.
Villa -Hemmed Up."
It Is known that by now they ai e
somewhere near the scene of the re
ported battle, for it has been several
dps since the column of CoL Dodd left
Cawas Grandes for the Galeana valley.
Mormons acquainted with the coun
try south of Casas Grandes say that
the rerahlng column should have been
able to reach Bavlcora last night, in
which event they are able to head Villa
off from a retreat over the 'Bavlcora
trail towards Madera. With the Dodd
column north of Villa, he Is hemmed
in completely It the Carrancistas are
in sufficient strength about Namlquipa
to prevent Villa, breaking through that
section towards Guerrero. V.
1'erNhIng Close to A'llla.
That Gen. Pershing and some of bis
forces are close upon Villa is certain.
The hurried departure of the aeroplanes
from Columbus, during which flight
two of the machines disappeared, clear
ly Indicates that a time has come in the
campaign where the "sk eyes" are
necessary. Nor has word come through
the stiff censorship in Juarez or in Co
lumbus to reveal whether or not the
crescent supposedly shutting In tho
bandit leader from the south has been
strong enough to withstand Villa's cun
ning and craft.

Hachita, N. M As part of the 12th Is
still at Columbus, the Inference is that
another column may follow the wake
of the Seventh and Tenth cavalries
from Highlonesome, over tho same
route followed by Col. Dodd.
So tlgbtlv drawn is the news censor
ship, so little probability Is there of one
correspondent developing a news chanp
nel not equally open to another, that
regularly at 10 oclock and 3 oclock each
day the Mexican consulate Is visited by
the press correspondents who have not
been included In the list to go to the
front.
Expecting some report from tho
Namlquipa engagement, a group of
these corespondents wore at the con
sulate Wednesday at daybreak. Consul
Garcia arrived at 9 oclock, assured
them there was nothing new, and at
0.30 entered a waiting automobile and
crossed to Juarez for his morning con
ference with Gen. Gavlra. It was .said
In Juarez that the wires are, still down'
somewhere south of Guzman.
Villa "Mut Stay Xenr J'uud.
"Villa will not leaic the country
where he Is now said to be," said a
business man of Chihuahua, Wednes
day. "He never carries with him so
much as a day's supply of food and de
pends entirely upon forays. To go up
Into the mountains for any time would
mean starvation, so I am confident that
he will operate along the fertile valleys
around Namlquipa, Bachinlvt and as far
west as Bablcora.
"The valleys thereabouts are all nar
row and in less than two hours he could
get up Into the mountains and elude
capture. That either American or Mexi
can troops should bo near him Is not
surprising. He might elude both for a
long while and never leave the zone
where he Is now operating.
"I have never speculated upon what
complexion the airplanes would give to
the pursuit If anything, It would tend
td break the Vtlllstas up Into small
groups, to avoid detection. I can con
ceive that the flight of the airships
would have a greater moral effect upon
tio- Villistas than that they could, in
themselves, impose any physical suffer
ing In fact It would do much toward
putting the fear of God Into tho hearts
of the Villistas, and which few of them
have It any longer."

courier to Columbus, N. M.. Mar.
22. The trail along which Pancho Villa
retreated from Columbus, less than
two weks ago. Is today a broad, well
worn highway, visible at some points
for miles as it winds over and around
the hills In northern Chihuahua. The
road Is an evidence of the efficiency of
the American army, which. In a week's
time, has converted the trail across a
semi-dMiert into a military road, the
main artery for supplies to Gen. J. J.
Pershing's punitive column.
This new road is not an Ideal high,
way. but it serves the purpose. The
big grey auto trucks which carry the
supplies by the ton, have cut ruts so
deeply In the bottomless sand and
gravel that at some places there is no
longer clearance for the axles, and
parallel roads have been laid out along
side the old trail.
Great Cloud Of Dust.
At intervals of a few miles each, all
day. can be seen what appear to be
huge clouds of grey smoke. These
mark the positions of the moving sup
ply trains, or cavalry patrols, squads of
signal corps men or military automo
biles. On the individual initiative and
skill Of the American soldier and his
officers depends the success of moving
supplies over these Mexican roads.
Motorcycle dispatch riders aid their
machines by vigorous use of their legs.
As the motorcycles plunge into the ruts,
or dip into sand piles, their riders

official advices from the American ex

Pershing and his men are close to Villa
and his bandits. All dispatches told of
the cooperation of the Carranza soldiers
in the bandit chase.
Despite unofficial reports of unset

In response .to a request from Gent

squadrons at Fort Meyer. Va., Fort
Sheridan, 111., and Fort Leavenworth,
Kas.. nnd the 21th Infantry, at Fort D.

start south today.
In official circles It was said today
that the protocol proposed by Gen. Car
ranza to govern the pursuit of Villa by
the international forces, will undoubt
edly be In force within, a few days..
Would Ilrnew Agreement.
This protocol, according to Tuesday's
Mexico City advices, will be practically
a repetition of the agreement of 1882,
between the United States and Mexico,
for tbn joint pursuit of savage Indians,
the chief difference being that the word
"bandits" will likely be substituted for
"Indians." The agreement would, re
strict the limits of search, prevent tho
occupation of towns, and obligate the
Invading party to return to its own
countr as soon as possible after the
purpose of the expedition has been defi
nitely accomplished or had failed.
