, -; Wood,
London, March 22. The Germans,
resuming their strong attack at Ver
dun, have made further progress to the
west of the Meuse in a violent hattle
that still continues. They are making
a strong drive at the French left flank,
well toward the border of the neigh
boring Argonne region, and have
gained ground south of Malancourt,
some 10 miles northwest of Verdun.
Their first attacks took them into
the Malancourt wood and yesterday's
official statement from Paris showca
them Blnce to have pushed some dis
tance further southward, occupying
the Avocourt wood, the southern sec
tion of the Malancourt wooded dis
trict. The Germans officially claim
the capture of 2500 prisoners. The
attacks have been made with impor
tant forces, with the support of a
heavy bombardment of shells of Urge
caliber and the throwing of liquid
fire by detachments carrying special
devices for the purpose. The Ger
mans attempted a further advance
southward, but, according to Paris,,
their attempts to debouch from lue
Avocourt wood were failures.
A dispatch from Paris last night
said . that a heavy German bomhnrd
men t on the left bank of the Meuae is
reported In the official communication
Issued by the war office. This opera
tion was carried out against the vil
lage of Esneos and hill 304, which lie
from one to two miles east of the
AVocdurt-Ma'lancourt line. The French
guns replied vigorously to the shell
ing and no attempt to assault with in
fantry was made.

PROF. HILL EG AS APPOINTED
Commissioner of Education to Succeed
Mason S. Stone.
Professor Milo B. Hillegas of the
Teacher's College, Coiumoia Universi
ty, has been appointed stute commis
sioner of education to succeed Mason
S. Stone. He will begin his duties
'ne 1. The appointment was made
fiaf n State board or euucatlon, which
;. ,, James wariness or apring
held, v Krank H. Brooks of St.
Johnsuur. ' v. A. W. Hewitt or
Piaiuiieid, Lii- J B. Johnson of Kan
doipn, Wallace H. Gilpin of Barton,
and Marvehe C. Webber of Kutlaud.
When an announcement of the ap
pointment of froiessor Hillegas was
sought last evening irom one of the
meuiDers or the board he declined to
speak for publication, but did not.
cieny the appointment had been made.
1-Tevlously, Mason S. Stone, at Mont
petier, had declared no appointment
had been made so' tar as he knew.
Mr. Stone resigned as commissioner
several months ago, but consented to
continue to serve as commissioner for
a time. Protessor Hillegas, his suc
cessor, is well known In Vermont, as
he made the detailed examination ot
the elementary schools of the State
lor the Carnegie foundation, whose re
port of the study of education in the
atate was published In 11)14. Profes
sor Hillegas spent many weeks in Ver
mont in gathering material for his
study oi' tne elementary schools. He is
unquestionably well qualified for this
Important work.
Some idea of his recommendations
for. the elementary schools can be gain
ed from the tollowing extract reprint
ed from the Educational Survey con
ducted under the Carnegie foundation.
A new course of study Is needed.
The steps that have been taken in this
matter are mainly in the right direc
tion. It is not possible for any one
person to be so fully acquainted with
all parts of the State that he can make
a course suited to all conditions
Since the course of study is such an
important factor in instruction It
should be made by those primarily
concerned with instruction; namely,
the teachers and superintendents with
the advice and direction of the State
board of education. For this purpose
experienced teachers and superintend
ents from all parts of the State shoulu
be organized into committees and
brought together at an early date, in
order that the general principle thai
shall govern the making of the course
may be fully explained and illustrated
Not less than two years should be al
lowed these committees in which t-
prepare a tentative course, which
should then be published and tried In
the schools for a year in order to rem
edy its eflects before final adoption
There should be at least two separatt
courses, one for the rural schools ana
one for the graded schools. Much oi

DEVELOPEMENT f.i
BETTERMENT
This Department Edited by Secretary
Willard W. Bartlett of the County
Improvement Association
Patrol the Roads.
Think this over:
To repair a road is to fix it after It
is bad.
To maintain a road is to keep it
from getting bad.
It is cheaper to maintain our roads
than to repair them.
The best and cheapest way to main
tain our principal highways is by the
patrol system and the State pays a big
share of the bills.
For the following article by State
Highway Commissioner, Stoddard B,
Bates, wf are Indebted to "The Ver
monter" published at White River
Junction.
To the average person who has not
thought much in a practical way about
the subject of good roads, the question
is naturally limited to the ' field of
mathematics we have so many miles
of roads, can build so many miles a
year, hence it will take so many years
to complete the work. 'To those who
have made a study of the subject, the
question of construction assumes a
secondary position and that of main
teuance the primary. When Vermont
inaugurated its road policy, little at
tention was paid to anything but con
struction. Funds were appropriated
ror construction only, and the main
taining of the" roads did not seem to be
a question for immediate considera
tion. Vermont was by no means alone
in taking this position. Later, how
ever, she was among the first to see
the immediate importance of the ques
tion of methods of maintenance.
As the years have gone by, we have
learned new tilings, and conditions
have greatly changed. We have im
proved some 2,000 miles of road, and
some of them are rather old at this
time. Some of them have needed lit
tle, if any, attention. Some have
needed more. We have learned this
and it is a good lesson for any road
man to learn at the outset that the
time to. begin to maintain a road is as
soon as the improvement or construc
tion of it is completed. This is more
seriously true at this time and under
present conditions than ever before.
When Vermont began to build roads,
an automobile was a luxury, to say the
least, and by no means a common
sight Its destructive work upon the
.loads was not seen or thought of. It
is now . apparent to , all. Gonerally
speaking, a road - begins a .process of
ieterioration the moment the improve
ment.ls ended- Little defects appear
that grow into; bad' places. A , little
-tg develops into a mudhole, and a lit
tle rut forms a channel for running
water that soon washes tho road bed.
We are now Bpenlilng of the type of
road wo have in Vermont. A gravel
read develops a rut in tho. w heel track
that will shortly be shunned by the
driver, who then proceeds to make a
new one, and soon the road surface is
badly rutted. The old statement that
a stitch in time saves nine was never
more true than when applied to road
maintenance. Some very destructive
washouts have resulted from inatten
tion at the proper time to a little water
running in a wheel track, or failure to
clean out a culvert in the fall or
spring.
Now in the road law of Vermont,
even as it stands today, the road com
missioners of the 246 towns arc the
ones who carry the responsibility of
the proper, maintenance of the roads,
and the state has only an indirect in
fluence. " The road commissioner' who
Is a natural road man will be of
greatest benefit to his town. But,' at
the best, the commissioner has many
miles of road requiring ' his attention
of which the State roads constitute
only about one quarter, and ho cannot
always give the immediate attention
to the defects in the main ' highways
that the public Is demanding.
As a result of the above situation,
the Legislature of 1912 passed a law
making It possible for the town and
State to unite in the work of mainten
ance, whenever the two agree upon
the details of the union, this measure
tends to relieve the town of some of
its burden, and to give to the State
more than a passing influence. In
every town there are selected high
ways, or State roads, upon which
State money can be expended. The
patrol system provides that the State
and the town may select a certain
number of miles of these State roads
to be maintained for the season by the
State. This maintenance by the State
covers only, ordinary ., maintenance,
and not those special items as . resur
facing,. .repairing or, replacing .of cul
verts, etc. The State secures the pa
trolman, establishes tho price to be
paid him and his help, and gives infor
mation, and instructions as to methods
to be used by:him. .... '..
In the agreement, the funds are sup
plledtby bptli town and State. The
town'apportlons such a sum of money
as seems to be equitable to both par
ties,' taking into consideration all the
circumstances involved, and an order
is drawn in favor of the State for the
amount. The latter then pays all of
the bills, and supplies all the funds
needed above the amount supplied by
tho town.
Weekly reports are sent by the pa
trolman to the County Supervisor for
his approval, after which they are for
warded to the State Commissioner

who upnrlR rhprk for the work re
ported, if the same is found in . due
lorm. This completes the chain. The
agreement is simple, but its results to j
the public are most beneficial. The j
patrolman stands in a position entirely
dissimilar to that of the road commis
sioner. He has a definite object in
view with the means to secure it He
has a personal employer. While the
methods of others are Bhown him, his
own Initiative is continually called up
on, and he becomes resourceful and, in
dependent. He takes pride in having
his road in the best possible condition.
He ceases to think he is engaged in lo
cal work merely, and begins to real
lzedie is engaged in a county wide,
State wide and world wide movement
of pVogress. It is almost needless to
sav that this attitude of an able' and
conscientious patrolman will be im
mediately reflected In 'his roads.
Stones will be removed, ruts tilled up,
water turned off, bags filled and the
road smoothed. '
This plan of maintenance is still
young. Vermont towns ftre nai swui
to change their methods. - Neverthe
less,) in 1913 there were some seventy
milos taken 611 by the State under the ;
patrol system. This mileago was in?
creased in 1914 to 286 miles, and , in
1915 to 455 miles. We have not. been
able yet to get very long continuous
routes, but have some fairiy well do
volopod. For illustration: We huvfc
routes from St. Albans to llichford,
nurlinnton to Wrhite River Junction
via Montpelior and Williamstown Gulf,
St. Johnsbury to Guildhall via Con
cord, and St. Johnsbury to Durke.
Kvery county Is represented by patrol
routes, thcugh these are not all well
connected in all the counties as yet.
We anticipate the- coming year will
show much advance along this line.
The routes above descriled are the
most continuous ones in tho State.
Thus far, we have endeavored to cover
as much as possible of tho arterial or
so-called trunk lines. It is upon these
that the most wear comes, causing
damage that tho towns will not be
likely to properly care for, as It would
take away too much money from : the
other roads of the town. We have to
remember that the town read tax Iuib
to maintain some 15,000 miles of road,
and it would be a hardly fair, proposi
tion to ask the town to expend .upon
special roads an amount too much in
excess of the pro rata. This is one of
the road problems Ave have to solve in
the best manner possible. Many times
the main thorofares or trunk lines
pass through a corner or-' side of a
town which does not use the road it
self to any appreciable extent, and It
would not seem consistent to ask for
more money per mile from the town
than is expended upon the roads used
by the town In the transaction of its
daily business. Hero is where . the
patrol system meets the emergency, a
the expense of the route can be appor
tioned between the state and the town
as the equity of the case may warrant,
causing no excessive burden upon eith
er. The average length of the routes
is about seven miles, which is about
what will make up continuous work
for the season.
The plan seems to be working out
successfully. The present routes, both
those that are connected ' and those
that are not, will be seen to lie in the
central and northern part of the
state. This is explained by tho dif
ference in the view of the plan taken
by the different towns. The plan is
open to all sections alike, but many
towns have not seen fit to avail them
selves of the advantages to be obtain
ed under the law. Unless present indi
cations fail, the applications from the
towns for the establishment of patrol
routes will be more numerous than be
fore and the connected routes will be
longer, as well as more numerous. !
The towns will see that better roads at
a reasonable cost is a better proposi
tion than poor roads at any price, and
that it is for their especial advantage
to have the state assist them, in work
ing out this plan maintenance. t

ATTACKED BY MUSK RAT
State Official Has Strange Experience
on Bennington's Main Thoroughfare
" Hon. Amos J. Eaton of South Royal
ton a member of the state board of
forestry who assisted Tax Commis
sioner Charles A. Pluniley at the an
nual meeting of the Bennington county
listers yesterday, was attacked by a
muskrat on Main street while taking
a morning walk. The big rodent bit
holes in Mr. Eaton's rubbers and gave
Other evidence of an aggressive dis
position. H'' ' '' '
1 Mr. Enton first noticed the rat In the
center of tho road neaf tho mill of thd
Cooper Manufacturing company.' The
nnlmal was traveling1 between the two
banks made by the : snow shoveled
frcm the trolley tracks. When he ap
proached from the side of the street
thus placing hfmseif between tho rat
and Its natural habitat, the river, the
animal immediately relented the inter
ference and showed fisht. With his
foot Mr. Eaton pushed the animal into
the snow where It was captured by
some boys from the mill.
The fact of a man being attacked by
a wild animal on the Main street of
Bennington Is so unusual that the Ban
ner is almost afraid to tell the story.
U. S. HONORS SPANISH DEAD

"Washington, March " 20. Having
learned that Spain contemplated send
ing a transport to Portsmouth, N. 11.,
to bring back the bodies of thirty-one
Spanish seamen who died in the naval
hospital there President, Wilson has in
formed the Spanish. Ambdctsn.Ior Senor
Itiano. that he would feel hone red it
permitted, to undertake disinterment
and removal of the bodies to the trans
pore
Tbe President took this action as a
mark of respect for the bravery of the
men belonging to Admiral Cervera's
squadron and the Spanish Government
has accepted the proposal. The letter
which Secretary Lansing wrote to the
Spanish Ambassador and the Ambas
sador's reply were made public today.
The transport, now in New York,, will
leave Portsmouth March 31.

commissioners and selectmen will hold
their annual gathering in Bennington,
arrangements have been made with
the Rutland Railroad company to run
a special train which will leave North
Dorset at 8.30 in the morning.
The experiment was tried a year ago
without largely increasing the atten

Battle,

General Perishing, in his operations
against Francisco Villa, suggested yes
terday that another regiment be sent
to him, and today General Funston ask
ed the War Department for what be
characterized as an adequate force.
The only reason given for strength
ening General Perlshing's force, known
by the public generally to be consider
ably more than 4,0u0 men, was that
Perlshing's field of operations bad be
come so extended that his main line of
communication and the subsidiary lines
were weaker than they should be.
"Merely a precautionary move," was
tbe way General Funston answered all
questions as to his motives in asking
more troops.
El Paso, Texas, March 21. American
troops have been dispatched in a sep
arate flying column to Las Cruces to
aid in fighting Francisco Villa and his
band of outlaws, who have been forced
Into another battle with the. Carranza
troops near that point. This informa
tion was in a wireless report received
early today at the United States Army
station in Columbus, N. M. Later wire
less communication was interrupted
With the Carranza troops pushing
steadily to the north and the two
American columns moving southward,
Villa can only turn into the mountain
ranges on his flanks should he try to
avoid battle. If the outlaw decides to
flee Into the mountains he probably will
break up his command into small bands
and enter the puzzling trails of the
Sierra Madres which he knows so well.
COLUMBUS WIRES HUM
Little New Mexico Town Suddenly Be
'" comes a News-Center. '1-
; Coliimbus, N.'M. -" has ' become ' al
most over night one of the most im
portant telegraph centers in the United
States. Before the Villa raid the send
lng or receipt of telegraphic messages
at Columbus was infrequent . Now the
town is the distributing point for prac
tically all of the news which cpfnes
from the punitive expedition. ; :
To meet the suddenly increased .de
mands on the telegraph service many
new wires have been strung from Co
lumbus to El Paso, a distance of about
Bevenly miles. El Paso already had
a large telegraph branch, but even that
was taxed beyond its capacity as a re
sult of the developments within the
last ten days. It was necessary, there
fore, to Install new equipment to get
all of the messages out.
An important part of the new equip
ment is an automatic device which has
been in use for several years by tele
graph companies and which makes pos
sible the sending of eight different
messages over one wire simultaneous
ly. The use of this device has made
it unnecessary to string any new wires
from El Paso. , . . ;
Scores of operators have been rush
ed to both Columbus and El Paso from
nearby points and other operators
have been sent from greater distances
to take their places. : :. ;
Columbus is the nearest point in
the United States to the route which
the American troops are taking. The
messages arrive from there by courier
and are relayed to El Paso, whence

Rumania's Attitude Affects Sentiment,
Also Verdun Defence.
Athens, March 20. A change in tho
Greek policy of non-intervention is be
lieved likely if Rumania enters the
war on the side of the Allies.
Already In political circles and in
the press the attitude toward the entry
of Greece Into the war Is slowly chang
ing in favor of intervention on the side
of the Allies. This change is due to
the gradual inclination of Rumania tow
ard the Entente's cause.
Another cause for the pro-Ally senti
ment is the failure of the Germans to
take Verdun after many weeks of
fighting.
The general feeling among the allied
Powers Is that If Greece wishes ' to
join the Allies at this stage of the
war she must do so without urging
and without the promise of territorial
reward for her action.

DOGS RUNNING DEER
Young Buck Killed in Broad Brook
Region In Pownai.
County Game Warden Edward ' S.
Hlggins was called to Pownai yester
day to investigate the killing of a
young buck which had been run dawn
by dogs in the Broad brook region.
The heavy snow on the mountains has
forced the deer from the high landfrto
the valleys along the ' streams and
some of the animals are seen-nearly
every day in the narrow pass known
as the Dugway. It has been- a' hard
winter for the deer and Warden Hlg
gins says that they are not in condi
tion to protect themselves from aogs.
Inasmuch as all hunting: seasons for
any kind of game, even rabbits, closed
several weeks ago, it is Incumbent ip-
011 dog owners to keep their dogs Un
der restraint and allow the deer an
opportunity to ccme through the re
mainder of the winter without annoy
ance, omctaiiy spring was supposed
to have arrived on March 20, but so
long as there is anywhere from three
to seven feet of snow in the woods
winter conditions still prevail. Once
the snow disappears the deer will have
a better chapce, but at the present
time it is an easy matter for a dog to
run down and kill a deer, especially a
yearling. '
