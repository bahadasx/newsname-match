MEETING LAST NIGHT.
Last night at a meeting of the
stockholders of the Dornick Hills
Country Club, it was voted to issue
$7,300 worth of bonds for the pur
pose of making additional improve
ments to the property.
This question was brought up at
the last regular meeting and deferred
until last night, in order to test the
sentiment of all the members on this
question and also on other questions
that were raised at that time.
President Maxwell told the stock
holders at that time that with addi
tional cash he could make a vast im
provement in the club, and his sug
gestions were acted upon at last
night's meeting. Mr. Maxwell, who
is considered the father of the coun
try club, will have entire charge of
the Improvements, as he has the
confidence of every member, each of
whom believe he knows best what is
needed.
It was voted that a different method
be adopted of selecting directors, in
future. The names of prospective
candidates will he posted at the club
house for a certain time before elec
tion in order to let the members
know who are slated.
Tho niioKtinn nf admitting SSB.T
ciate members was also voted upon, I
and it was decided that twenty-five
could be admitted upon payment of
an initiation fee of $23 and the pn-
ment of twice the amount of mantl.lv
dues of the regular charter members.
The affairs of the club under the
able direction of Mr. Maxwoll are in
most excellent shape, and the stoM-
holders congratulate themselves that
they have a man or his cnlibr.-s to
direct the affairs of the institution.
FRUIT FROM FLORIDA
Fresh Shipment from the Dunn & Gil
lam Ranch in That State Arrived
J. Robert Gi'.lam is taking a special
pride today in exhibiting some fine
fruit and vegetables that have ar
rived by express from the Dunn & Gil
lam ranch in Florida. In the ship
ment were some healthy looking well
developed ripe tomatoes, some green
peppers and a fruit called the kumquat
which is a species of the desert lemon.
It has the color of the orange or
lemon and the flavor is more of the
lemon than of the orange. The ranch
also grows oranges, lemons and limes
and Mr. Gillam Is dreaming ' ;Hs
days when he shall have amassed a
great fortune in Oklahoma oil lands !
and shall retire to Florida and live on i
that fruit farm when he gets ready to j
retire from life's activities. But Bob
is made of the mettle that will not I
retire and if he should add a few mil-
liens to the fortune he already has, he
would still remain here and be more
active than ever in developing wild
cat territory which he is making a
specialty of in southren Oklahoma.
It must be a great relief for on?e
for the girls to be able to pop the
question without having to question I

TUESDAY EVENING EIGHT
THOUSAND HOMELESS.
NO LBSS OF LIFE
Estimates Today Place the Total Loss
at Five Million Dollars, Although
Accurate Accounting of the Losses
is Impossibility.
Paris, Tex., March 22. A toll of
three lives and property damage esti
mated by Mayor McGuistion at be
tween eight and ten million dollars,
was done in last night's fire here.
The dead are:
JOHN SCHAUB, negro, burned to
death in his home,
MRS. W. J. BAILEY, aged 60, died
of fright.
MRS. A. G. POUL, an aged woman,
supposed to have been burned in her
home.
Talis. Tex., March 22. Conserva
tive estimates of the number of peo
ple rendered homeless by last night's
fire in the business and residential
districts here were eight thousand,
according to Mayor McGuistion this
morning. The monetary damage is
estimated at five million dollars, al
though it is impossible to get an ac
curate accounting.
An unusual feature was that no
lives were lost and no one was ser
iously injured.
Although the city is without food,
all business houses having been burn
ed, there is apparently little suffering,
and a good natured, though dazed
view is being taken of the disaster
today.
Women and children were cared for
in the buildings that remained, and
the men who did not spend the night
fighting the fire, slept on lawns and
in the open.
The clearing of the streets started
this morning, hut the job will prob
ably take several days.
Tiio few remaining smaller build
ings are occupied today by shops and
stores of all kinds. The merchants
are dealing in commodities sent from
cities nearby by special train.
Sixty per cent of the residence and
business section of the city was de
st roved by the fire, which started at

REASONS WHY IT IS NECESSARY
TO ENLARGE WARD BUILDINGS
Following is a statement made (o
the people of Ardmore by members
of the board of education:
The board of education regrets that
it is necessary to ask the people of
Ardmore to vote an additional bond
issue. .It is imperative that the ca
pacity of the wards be increased, for
the following reasons:
First The census enrollment shows
that we have 650 children of scholas
tic age more than we had a year ago.
This increase has largely come dur
ing the last six months, or an aver
age of something like 100 pupils per
month. Doubtless before September
there will bo 1,000 children more
than there were last September.
Second At the present time there
are a number of rooms where the
teachers have in regular attendance
from C3 to 75 children. Such crowded
conditions endanger the health of the
children and make it impossible for
the teacher to give the children the
instruction which they deserve.
Third Our experience during the
year has shown that some of the
rooms based on the present scholastic
population do not have enough seats
in them to actually accommodate the
students in that particular grade, and
all the seats are placed in the rooms
that can be. Our present buildings
are therefore inadequate for the scho
lastic' population as it exists today
without taking into consideration any
increased population that may come
from month to month or year to year.
We have considered tho various
ways in which additional room might
be given and the board has decided
that it. is better and moro economical
to add additions to tho four ward
buildings than to undertake to build
a new building.
In the first place, we already own
(lie ground on which the additions
will be built and the expense of a
site is therefore eliminated, and also
the expense of one of the walls. In
addi'.on to this it wiii not require
an extra principal for a ward build
ing and the ruMitiiu should be at
tached to the present school buildings
because it makes the location at the
proper places in the various wards.
The idea of the board is to build
four additional rooms to each of the
ward buildings together with ap
proaches, hallways and stairways,
two rooms below and two rooms
above. Also, when this addition is
made to so construct two of the
rooms in each of the wards so that
a sliding door of some kind will be
provided for to form a partition in
such a way that it can be removed,
throwing the two rooms together for
auditorium purposes.
The architect has been at work on
these additions for quite a while
and the least amount that will pro
vide for the additions. togUher with
the heating system, Man-ways ana
furniture, is approximately $10,000.
He was instructed to use every econ
omy possible in making the plans in
order that all money might be saved
that could be in the construction of
the additions. Th"se additions will j
increase the seating capacity of the 1
ward buildings 00 per cent.

THE YOUNGER BOYS.
Lee's Summit, Mo., March 22. Cole
Younger, the last member of the no
torious outlaw band which infested
western Missouri during and after the
Civil War, died ut his home here last
night. He was a member of Quan
trell's bund of guerillas and with bis
two brothers .took part with the James
Boys in bank and train robberies in
Missouri land adjoining states that
netted the looters more than one hun
dred thousand dollars. After a long
term in prison Cole Younger became
a law-abiding Missouri citizen. He was
the oldest of the throe "Younger Hoys"
After the Civil War, the Younger
and the James boys pulled off many
sensational robberies, among them be
ing the following:
The raid on the Liberty, Mo., bank
In 1 StiO. One bank defender shot dead
and $72,000 stolen.
The looting of a Hussellville, Ky.,
bank in 1S0S for $17,000.

while 1,000 persons looked on.
The Corydon, La., bank robbed of
j 10,000 the same year.
A dozen other .sensational robberies
for which the Younger and James boys
w ere blamed, were carried out success
fully before the three Younger broth
ers were captured in Minnesota af
ter a raid on a hank at Xorthlield,
Minn., in lS7ti in the course of which
Cashier Haywood was killed.
In August, I'Jl.'S, Younger was con
verted to religion at a revival meeting
and became an active church worker.
"I've led an adventurous, turbulent
life," he said. "The war brought on
hate and .strife and killing around
here. 1 have been blamed for a lot of
it with which I bad nothing to do.
They murdered my father and I was
launched in to a life of shooting and
reprisals and rough riding, winding up
with 25 years in the penitentiary. I
was brought up in a Christian home.
Now I'm an old man and I've come by
God's mercy hack to the place of my
childhood to end my days.'"
