PEACE MAY BE
INSIGHT
Latest Dispatches From Europs
Lead Students of the War to
So 'Believe.
Events of the grentest significance
which may be taken as fore-casting
the early termination of tho Euro
pean war are contained in news dis
patches, chiof of which is one from
Galveston, Texas, contained in a
cablegram snid to linvo been re
ceived by a Galveston shipping firm
in which the sentence "immediate
peace is in sight," is included. Tho
cnblegram was one in which ar
rangements made for chartering si
large nmount of ship tonnage is
cancelled.
1 Other straws which lend a sem
blance of confinnation of this very
significant statement, are dispatches
from Paris and Athens. From tho
French Capital comes a story qf
the assembling of a great confer
ence of political and military lead
ers of the Entente Powers, nt which
joint policies to be pursued are to
be discussed. From thc Greek cap
ital comes reports 'that every indi
cation points to tho early ending of
the hcutrnlity of Rumania in favor
of thc Allies. Coupled with this
may
be tho Allied announcement
Greece hns wavered too long
iking sides with the Entente
id that she mnv no- longer look
forward to territorial or other con
cessipns as the uricofor her align
ment against the Teutonic Powers.
- Other indications- that Gormany
inay bo hard-pressed nro found -in
thc new food regulations at Berlin,
whore further restrictions are plac
ed upon tho civilian population and
very meager quantities of some of
the essentials arc allowed each per
son. Coupled with what is gener
ally believed in well-informed cir-
eles to bo thJ fwiIuro of thc Sniia
cr,unu operations against Verdun
and militnry occurrences in other
thentors of war, includiug persistent
rumors that Tuikey is anxious to
conclude a soparntc peace, it is pos
sible that tho greatest war in tho
world's history may moro nearly bo
approaching its last stages than
heretofore has been generally
thought.
