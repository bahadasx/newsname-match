The request was made at the sts^
I gestion of General Pershinw, > om
maiidcr of the expedition. who ureed
I that another regiment be sent to him.
| In his message to th-> War Oepartm nt.
General Kunston asked for what ita
! termed an "adequate force."
It was announced at ??enera! Knus
ton's headquarters that the Kir-i ?W
alry. of w hich one squadron is at Kort
I Mver. Va.. another at I'ort l-eawn
| worth, Kaiis., and the tiiird at l'ort
j Sheridan. U'yo . would be brought 10
I the border at once and sent forw "d
along General Pershing's line of coin
munieatlon to Casas lirande? Whether
he asked for other troops. General
' Kunston would not say.

The only reason given for strength
eninc General Pershing's force, 1%nowa
to lie considerably more than w.is
[that his tield of operations '..ad 'er ?
'?oiiic s<> extended that his main lina
of communication and the subsidiary

"Merely a precautionary move." was
the way General Kunston answered all
inquiries lie was asked if the re
ported movement of ttooos of the ?ie
facto government from garrisons in
the interior to posts on the border aful
reported failure of the f',n r;in/.a truopa
in one or two instances to show avtie'e
co-operation m .he pursuit of Villi*
had anything t-> do with his deoi^ioa
to nsU for more strength, but hi up
dined to answer
Some uneasiness was ? 1 jj?l.?>"<? ?i for
a moment at department headquarters
to-day when :t was reported that ilie
telegraph wires between Casus Grande*
and the border had been cut. hut :>n
oflicini report statiir-r that the lint eti?
was a "buzzer" line General PerrdnnCf
had laid, and that it had been broken

forces ? rossins it alia, ed apprehension.
It is j.ot believed here that General
Kunston is worried by reports of al

carefully studx in^; that phase of tii.i
