Berlin, March 22. The German
army has opened hostilities on a
new foe women's fashions. The
large consumption of cloth under
the prevailing styles has inspired
the .army authorities to call a con
ference to deliberate measures
designed to influence future fash
ions in the direction of greater
economy in materials.
The ministry of war, with true
military astuteness, is not at
tempting to affect styles already
in vogue or to forbid women

Paris, March 22. -With approxi-
mately 8,000 persons homeless, the
entire business section of Paris wiped j
out bv fire and fifteen hundred to two
thousand dwellings destroyed, the
flames which started shortly after 5
o'clock yesterday afternoon still were
burning at different points in the city
at daybreak today. The property loss,
from the most authentic sources,
stands at from two and a half to five
ami a half millions of dollars. Ru
mors, vague but persistent, were that
from 1 0 to 30 persons had lost their
lives in the holocaust.
Confirmation, however, was lacking
and while, considering the property
damage, it seemed miraculous there
should have been no deaths, the opin
ion of those best informed was that no
person had met death.

Thousands of homeless men, women
and children were being cared for as
best possible early today in private
residences, railway stations and the
few remaining public buildings. The
question of making definite arrange

was expected to be taken up by the
city authorities early in the morning.
Food supplies will be the most seri

and grocery in the city having been

London, March 22. The battle for
Verdun now well in its fourth week
continues with intensity but at present
the infantry is held in leash while the
big guns prepare for further assaults.
The powerful German thrust west of
the Meuse, which developed eariy this
week, halted when it reached the
southern edge of Avocourt wood. But
the activity of the German artillery in
this sector which Paris reports today
particularly violent, indicates the Ger
man intention probably is to make
further determined attempts to ad
vance this important flanking opera
tion. The situation on the eastern
bank of the Meuse is unchanged, but
here too the artillery' fire continues
near Vaux and Damloup.
