Oen. Pershing's forces moved with
such rapidity following the battle
between Francisco Villa's bandits
and Carrarzlsta.s at 11.- Oruces that
VilLa'.s retreat toward l?abi -ora was
cut off, according to the meagre re
ports received at (im. Oaviera's
headquarters in Juarez today. The
bandit leader ami his demoralized
followers were compelled to leave
the trail they were following and
take to the Sierra Madre mountains.
A rumor in Juarez today said that
Villa's American pursuers had had a
clash with the bandit le-ader's pa
trols', but no official confirmation
wuls obtainable. If the United States
troopers hae been fighting the Yil
listas the details probably will not
arrive for several days owing to the
rapidity, of (ien. Pershing's move
ments. Oen. Oaviera understands that the
t'arranzistas who defeated Villa at
Iwm Cruces are pursuing the outlaws
Into tho mountains.

According to dispatches received

Villa' men are approximately ''
miles southeast of Namiquipa and
within 10 miles of a great plateau
stretch which make a prent Kittle
uround almost In the clouds.
The exact location of the Amer
ican troops has not boon revealed,
but, It 1 believed that at least one
( nliiiun 1st within a, few hours" march
of actual hostilities, if the fighting
li;s not already begun. The Amer
ican officers have been on tho alert
for one of Villa's typical swift moves.
Villa's men are now believed to be
in three croups. It was considered
possible that the band bring pur
sued by the ("aria nzista fortes from
Namiquipa might be drawing the
Oarranzlta forces to a fighting
(ground of Villa's own choosing,
where the other two 1 ! i,-s of Villa's
galloping cavalry might join their
chieftain to turn back the pn-s uit.
Villa, (ien Oaviera believes, will
hae to make a decided stand within
a few hours. He has gathered fre-h
recruit on his bo. est that he could
whip the American ar:n and all tho
other forces again-t him. IVrhap
