Paris, Tex March 22 A state
ment Issued by Mayor McQuistion
today placed the damage in last
nfchtN tire at between $8,000,000
and 1UMWUMH. The known deaths
are three. The first casualty

failure caused by excitement. Mrs,
A. ('. ltould, an aged woman, whose
tintie on South Main street, was
burned, is missing. It is feared
that she was burned to death.
At one o'clock the fire had extended
to the west side of the public square
anJ was consuming the courthouse,
the new federal building and the new
high school. From that time until
morning the flames spread, burning
an additional twenty-odd blocks and
eight or nine hundred residences.
Paris, Tex., March 22. With ap
proximately 10,000 persons homeless
the entire business section of Paris
wiped out by fire and from 1,500 to 2,
000 dwellings destroyed, the flames,
which started shortly after 5 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, still were burning
at different points in the city at day
break today. The property loss, from
the most authentic sources, stands at
from two and a half to three and a half
millions of dollars.
Rumors vague but persistent, were
that from 10 to 30 persons had lost
their lives. Confirmation, however,
was lacking, and while considering the
property damage, it seemed miraculous
there should have been no deaths, the
opinion of those best informed was
that no person had met death.
Food Problem Serious.
Thousands of homeless men, women
and children were being cared for as
best possible early today in private
residences, railway stations and the
few remaining public buildings. The
question of making definite arrange
ments to care for these unfortunates
was expected to be taken up by the
tity authorities early. Food supplies

Chicago, March 22. Northeastern
gales bearing with them rain, sleet,
hail and snow accompanied by fre
quent lightning flashes swept over
eastern Indiana, northern Illinois and
southern Wisconsin today. The storm,
which was of unusual violence cost
one life, caused many injuries and
great property damage. In Logansport
buildings were unroofed and the flying
wreckage caused the only fatality re
ported. Several Illinois cities, among
them Kankakee and Beaversville, suf
fered severely while Chicago sus
tained all the ill effects of a blizzard
except low temperatures. Not for
20 years had the waters of Lake Mich
igan piled so high against the Chi
cago breakwater as today. Wave after
wave driven by the northeast gale
surged into the harbor and against
the piers. Railroad transportation
was delayed, street cars were held up,
windows were broken and shade trees
uprooted in various sections of the
city. The steampship Arizona, in
bound from Manitowac, was reported
safely headed with the wind toward
harbor. The Bteamer Puritan which
was on the lake when the storm was
at its height reached port at Holland,
Mich., in safety. Before 9 a. m. the
storm abated in Chicago and hundreds
of men began removing the snow from
the streets.
One Fatality at Logansport
Logansport, Ind., March 22. Re
ports received early today from the
region swept by a tornado last night
disclosed one man killed and probably
twenty persons injured. Some of them
seriously, and many thousands of dol
lars worth of damage done. The storm,
which did not last more than ten min
utes, swept across the city in a nar
row path. In the business district
roofs were torn off, windows broken
and trees uprooted. Trees falling
across telegraph and telephone wires
severed wire communication. Street
car traffic was blocked by debris
heaped upon the tracks and the de
struction of electric light wires left
the city in darkness.
The roof of the SIder Broom fac
tory was blown off and crashed
against the side of the home of Ben
jamin Ricketts, killing W. J. Ricketts
and injuring other members of the
family. The west front gable of the
old high school building was blown
down and the slate from the roof was
blown across the street, wrecking the
windows of the Baptist church.

Two American Aviators Still

Are Uneasy.
San Antonio, March 22. Al
though it was 60 hours at noon
toduy since General Pershing filed
his last message regarding the
disposition of United States cav
alry south of Casas Grandes, Gen
eral Funston professed no anxiety
as to the welfare of any of the
troops.
General Funston believed it not
unlikely that by this time the
Americans and Villa's men had
met.
San Antonio, Tex., March 22. One
of the aviators missing from the
squadron that went to join General
Pershing's column, descended some
where south of Casas Grandes, it was
learned at General Funston's head
quarters today. Hi3 name was not
given.
Reports today explained that one
reached Casas Grandes and was sent
south over the country in which the
three detachments of cavalry are op
erating. No details relative to his dis
appearance were received.
El Paso, Texas, March 22. News
that communication had been re
established with the American and
Carranza forces operating against
Francisco Villa was being awaited
with intense interest today, aa was
also information regarding the fate
of Lieutenants Robert H. Willis and
Edgar S. Gorrell, flying men of the
first aero squadron, who disappeared
while attempting flight from Colum
bus, N. M., to General Pershing's field
base at Casas Grandes.
Early this morning, according to
dispatches from Columbus, the wire
less station there was in communica
tion with the field station at Casas
Grandes, transmission soon failed.
Mexican officials have conceded that
the severing of telegraphic service be
tween Juarez and Casas Grandes
probably was accomplished by a ban
dit raid on the Mexican Northwest
ern railroad. In some quarters here
there has been a disposition that Villa
sympathizers may have cut the ground
wire laid by General Pershing in hi3
march southward from Columbus. If
this is the case; it is pointed out, there
would be good reason to fear for the
safety of Lieutenants Willis and Gor
rell. Nothing is known regarding the
place at which the two officers dis
appeared. If they lost their bearings
and got out of their scheduled course,
it Is pointed out, they may have been
compelled to descend and may have
fallen into the hands of some of the
wandering bandit squads. Drivers of
motor trucks carrying supplies south
from Columbus were instructed to
watch for every possible trace of the
two flyers.
The fact that Willis and Gorrell car
ried only three days' ratiens and two
small canteens of water added to the
anxiety, over their mishap,

RAILROADS CAUSE
WORRY AT BORDER
El Paso, March 22. The Mexican
railroad situation took first place in
public interest on the border today,
following a report that the American
military authorities were contemplat
ing sending a new column into Mexi
co from Fabens, a village 30 miles east
of here. It was stated that this plan
was under consideration as an alter
nate should Carranza refuse the re
quest of the Washington government
for the use of the Mexican Northwest
ern railroad over which to transport
supplies.
From Guadalupe, across the border
from Fabens, one of the best wagon
roads in northern Mexico leads south,
almost to El Vallo.
That the railroad problem will bring
a real crisis in the relations between
the Carranzistas and Americans is
