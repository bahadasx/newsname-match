Farm
A Farm with an unpainted
house standing in an open field
in the glaring sunshine, with
cottoA rows running up near it,
no green grass, no trees nor
shrubbery, and not a flower

the boys and girls of the family
will embrace the first opportuni
ty to escape from.
Especially will this be the case
with the girls if the interior of
the house corresponds with the
exterior, for much of the beauty
and comfort of the home depends
on the woman having a
chance to beautify the interior.
The farmer in such a place as I
have described may by most rigid
economy accumulate money,
and may get a reputation among
nis neighbors as a good farmer,
simply because he has made
some money. But he has missed
life, real life, and has simply
been grubbing after filthy lucre.
He has failed to make a home,
and from the old house that was
simply a shelter, the boys and
girls will leave him to himself
after awhile and would not be
manly boys nor womanly women
if they did not. For the boys
and girls are catching the spirit
that is abroad in the South, and
will leave the old shelter and be
making real homes for themselves.
Painting the house is not only
adding to its appearance, but is
important in adding durability
to the woodwork. A dwelling
should be painted every three
years at least.
Thpn molrp a nr^Mu nrrace
lawn about the house, especially
a good sweep of grass showing
from the front windows. While
> trees and shrubbery are important
and desirable, do not smother
the whole front with trees but
keep some open lawn there and
plant trees and shrubbery as a
framework for the lawn. In
our Southern homes we use the
porches more for shade than the
trees, and we do not want the
breeze smothered out by too
thick planting of trees.
Flowering shrubbery along
the base of the house greatly
helps the appearance of the
house itself, and with a variety
that bloom in succession from
early spring till late supimer the
shrubbery can be made very attractive
and interesting. Then
10 ine siaes 01 me dwelling nave
some flower beds, largely of the
hardy herbaceous plants that
come up and bloom every year
with some of the summerflowering
bulbs like the old Madonna
lily and gladiolus, and on the
shady side ot the he use a bed of
the lily of the valley.
Then keep the grass in the
lawn good and neat with the
lawn mower and an annual top
dressing of bone meal, and do
not use it for a horse pasture.
Stock of no kind should be allowed
on the lawn. Have a
good pasture elsewhere, so that
thprp h; ill Ko nrv "

turn the horses on tiie lawn to
tear up the shrubbery and bite
the trees.
Then make a drive to the
house that will not be used by
the farm wagons, and make this
drive of good material, rock, if
at hand, for the foundation, and
close packing gravel for the sur
inv^t
See that the rooms inside are
made homelike with neat wall
paper and good pictures and
good books and plenty of papers
ami magazines. Get a good
lighting system, if you can af- J
ford it; and above all provide
the house with running water
and a good bath and drainage.

Americans Are 11U Miles Below
The Border ]
With the American Army
March 18.?Via Wireless to
Columbus, N. M.?After marching
more than 110 miles into
Mexico,i in 42 hours, the American
punitive expedition today
received information apparently
locating Pancho Villa, the object
of their chase. Disposition of
the troops began tonight for the
task of hunting him down.
Meanwhile, Villa was reported
continuing his outrages upon
Americans.
The expedition reached?

were informed that the Mexican
leader passed through this place ,
only a few days ago. The latest
information of Villa's present
whereabouts placed him on the 1
ranch of Candelario Hernandez,

mounted. They pressed through
a section of Mexico where water ,
was scarce. For such i large >
body of men the speed main- <
tained was remarkable and the 1
good condition in which they '
came through was inspiring. 1
Only a few cavalry horses and '
pack mules were lost, the vie- <
tims of a hard ridden trail. The
men reached the camp thirsty (
and hungry but otherwise in \
good condition, fit for action and j
eager for the pursuit of Villa to
begin in earnest.' ttere" thev 1
were met with reports that Villa !
had raided the American colon 1

tain retreats and that he had killed
residents of these colonies.

Curative Value of Wheat Bran
Perhaps if ordinary wheat
Dran, which anyo >e can secure
[or a few pennies, were put up
r 4
in iancy pouna pacxages as a '
valuable laxative, and a fancy .
price charged for it. more peo- j
pie would use it. Like so many j
other things in the world, hecause
it is cheap, people fail to '
place a proper valuation on it. !
As a laxative wheat bran has 1
few equals writes Dr. A. M.
Hughes in Farm and Home. It ,
leaves no bad* results if taken
properly, and seldom fails to re
lieve constipation and the very '
many ailcnts that result directly
and indirectly from constipation. :
Bran taken properly, will i
clear up the so-called 'liver-spot- ]
ted" skin, remove the ordinary j
indigestion, remedy dry skin,
and, it is claimed by many, prove
a help in anemia.
Nothing comes in boxes, jars, !
or bottles, that is much a skin i
beautifior n?? whpnt Kran \
r>oor skin, as most people know ,
now, is due to impure blood, and
impure blood is generally a 1
stomach condition. Constipation,
indigestion and other ail- 1
ments cause sallow, blotched,
pimply and otherwise unlovely (
complexions. The use of wheat
bran will help to correct these,
relieve the constipation, improve
the blood, and, this done, the
skin becomes once more good <
to look upon. No beauty doc- j
tor can begin to work such a
miracle of beautifying the skin
with mere cosmetics and instruments.
It is especially good for
skin eruptions, noted so frequent- 1
ly with young people. One 1
jood way to take it is to stir it
in a glass of cold?not ice water,
irid drink it.

his manner, mix it with the
norning cereal.
For children, invalids or anyone
else who likes it that wav,
nix a good quantity of bran
with marmalade, honey or some
Mher syrup, and spread it on
Dead.
Or it may be eaten clear, as a <
;ereal, with cream and a little 1
sugar. i
As to the quantity, it all defends
upon your need of a laxa- <
ive. Anywhere from one to
ive heaping tablespoons may 1
:>e taken daily. The morning is i
i good time to take this, as it is
lot a severe physic when han- i

N. C. The shooting occurred a
at a road house in Carroll County,
near the Virginia-North Carolina
line, where the two men
had secured lodging for the ^
night.
Allen, it is said, resented a
a
statement made by McGraw, ^
that Wesley Edwards, one of the
clan who is now serving a 27- tl
year term in the Virginia peni- c
tentiary, "does not have the ^
nerve people give him credit *

A fist fight ensued, the men (
clinched, two shots were fired in c
rapid succession, and Allen fell
with a bullet through the brain. a
The dead man was the father ,
c
of Friel Allen, serving 15 years ^
in the Virginia penitentiary for
participation in the Hillsville e
tragedy, and brother of Floyd ^
Allen, who died in the electric
chair two years ago in expiation
of his part in the court house ^
shooting. v .
Jasper Allen was famed in the
mountains for his fearlessness, .
arid was said to be the "brains" \
of the Allen clan. ^
McGraw fled to the mountains,
where it is believed he is

in hiding. He is wanted bv Fed
