of the spot where Francisco Villa was
last reported."
Captain Chandler, wireless expert,
was sent to Columbus to Investigate
the radio difficulties. The field tele
graph between Columbus and South
Ascension haa been reported cut in
many places, according to headquar
ters statements. ;
General Pershing has sufficient men
to fight any Vllllsla bunds that may
be encountered, officers believe.
Headquarters recommended thai the
war department purchase, more auto
tractor wireless equipments, so as to
minimise danger of the forces being
lost track of. . -. .
At army headquarters It was stated
that Carranxlstas were not known to
be actively aiding the Americans at
any point, though they were supposed
to be co-operating. , Mexicans are not
given any Information regarding the
whereabouts of Cerranslsta troops.

stitutionalist troops were not con

ed troops has been ordered to Col
umbus from Fort D. A. Russell. Two

thinning the American rank in
Mexico.' . $
Seven soldiers arrived .'. here for
treatment today, They said Ameri

and, dysentery. By day they Buffered

cases are being sent back to the bor
der. ' .

Sixteenth infantry, said , pneumonia
waa the moat prevalent complaint.'
When dysentery, waa discovered, the

bad army water la hold to be it prin
cipal cause, Boiling drinking water
Is the commonest precaution.

BIG AG8EAGE
OF BEETS AT
SUIRI
Farmers Take Kmdly to New
Industry, and 8 Seeders,
With Seed. Are Ordered
by the Field Saperhtendent
A hurry-up call came to the Oregon
Utah Sugar company Tuesday from
F. S. Bramwell, at 8utherlln, In Doug
las county, for eight seeder and beet
seed to be shipped to that point. Ex
cellent success Is being met in that
district in the signing up of acreage,
and It Is expected that every acre that
the Medfordites failed to meei their
obligations upon will be covered with
two acres by the Umpqua valley farm
ers. The beets grown In the Suther
lln district this' season are to be ship
ped to the Grants Pass factory, but It
teems assured that next year a factory
will be built there, this having been
agreed 'to by the sugar 'company if
sufficient acreage Is signed'. "
The seeding of beets throughout
the Rogue valley Is now progressing,
and will be pressed as rapidly as pos
sible till the crop Is all In the ground.
The river bottom soils, and some of
the banch lands are in excellent con
dition for seeding, though the show
ers of the past tew days have retard
ed the work somewhat. ' Tracts in
the heavier soils are not all yet ready
for workf and seeding will no doubt
be continued well through April. ; -Work
' upon the factory is being
crowded now with all possible speed.
and more materials are arri ving daily,
so that the erection 'of the structures
will progress without delay for steel,
etc.

arduous , fatigue duty,, uniforms are
alwaya.presBed and look "new." ,
Travelers who have seen the fight
ing men ot Europe, passing through
camps ot the "new"4 army, place it
on a par, if not above, any array
now at war. But every one ot these
observers remark upon the insigni
ficance of the force.,..
"A wonderful machine," they say,
"but hopelessly small."
Residents of these border places
take a similar view of the situation.
They appreciate the fighting quality
ot the men, but have a fear ot Mex
ico which an adequate army, they
say, would alleviate.
Judge D. A. Richardson, legal rep
resentative for the tlo facto govern
ment of Moxlco, an American who
loarned tbe Mexican language before
he mastered English, declared that
It took him 40 years to learn' the
Mexican character, to find only when
war came that ho did not know it .all.
. "I am afraid for our boys down
there," he said, "when the first blood
Is shed Americans also will learn the
Mexican character."
