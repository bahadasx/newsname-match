Proposed Order.
London, March 17.?A far-reaching
order in council, which will totally
prohibit importation Into the United
Kingdom of a large number of art*r
else which oomo under the general
heading of luxuries will he issued, by
the British government at an early
date. <
Among the thlnge which will he
placed under the ban will ho autome*
"biles for private use, musical Inatrjft
ments, cutlery of all kinds, hardwai*
yarns, chlnaware, fancy foods and
soap. The order will apply equal}} to
all countries, including the Britia>
dominions and colonies.
The forecast of the coming- ordtr hv
council was given to the Associated
Press today in an Interview by Wal?
ter Runciman, president of the hoard
of trade. Mr. Runclman admitted that
articles In addition to those named
would he placed on the list of prohi?
bited imports, hut in advance of the
issuance of the order he declined to
say what they are. He agreed that
the decree would; have considerable of ?
eat on exports from the United
States, but pointed out that it applied
to all countries alike, and declared It
wae absolutely necessary to limit. &e
Shipment df bulky luxuries in ordert?
provide room on ships for necessities.
"But please remember," said Mr.
Runclman, "that the iasuance of U?s

ORDER WILL AFFECT AMERICA.
However, it is Claimed Undo 8am
Will Have no Ground for Protest.
Washington, March 17.?American
trade will be seriously affected by
Issuance of far reaching British or?
ders in council, but \t is realized that'
Since there is to be no discrimination
there will be no ground for protest by
the United States.
While the urgent need of Great
Britain for ships to carry necessaries
is recognised, it is generally believed
here * that another important factor
In the situation is the desire of Brit?
ish Interests to equalise the rate of
exchange between London and New
Tork. With imports from the United
States limited to articles and products
Imperatively needed the balance of
trade In favor of America necessarily
will bo reduced and tho value of a
pound sterling on this side of the wa?
ter might get back to near normal
again.
One of the most serious aspects of
the situation in the view of officials
here is the probability that Great
Britain's ever increasing demands up?
on her merchant marine will with?
draw British ships now plying between1
North and South America. With few
American or other neutral vessels
available, this would have a disas?
trous effect upon the plans of mer?
chants and manufacturers of the
United States to develop their trade
with the Southern countries.
PUSHING PREPAREDNESS PRO?
GRAM.
Washington, March 17.?Under
forced draft and gag rule congress
today began to grind out the admin?
istration's preparedness program. In
the house debate began on the Hay
bill, providing for a standing army of
one hundred and forty thousand and
the federallzation of the militia. The
house will work night and day and it
is hoped by the leaders to force a
vote in two weeks. Meantime the sen?
ate committee will put the finishing
touches on the Chamberlan hill pro?
viding for a standing army of two
hunded and fifty thousand. The sen?
ate also expects to pass the measure
in two weeks. It then goes to con?
ference where tho two hills will be
combined Into what will probably be
its final form, which will call for an
army of one hundred and seventy-five
or two hundred thousand.

that the policemen were attacked and
that Lee was killed as they were de?
fending themselves. The State at?
tempts to show that the officers ex?
ceeded their authority and that Sam
and Oley Lee were acting as peace
makers In the difficulty.

testified and the case for the defense
is being rapidly presented. The cause
Is being hard fought. The jurors
were put on their volr dire and many
talesmen were challenged. The jury
as finally composed Is made up of able
Citizens.
When this case is concluded It is
pobable that cases will be called,
charging Carson Lee, Oley Lee and
others of the family with assault and
battery and resisting an officer.

families of the county and has always
b^en prominent in its public affairs.

COURT REQUIRjfes PAYMENT OF
APPROPRIATION.
Comptroller General to Honor War?
rants on Fond of $100,000?Render
Unanimous Decision.
Columbia, March 17.?The supreme
court yesterday issued a writ of man?
damus requiring the comptroller gen?
eral to Issue warrants on the fund of
$100,000 appropriated by the laat gen?
eral assembly for repair work at the
State Hospital for the Insane. The
opinion in the case was written by
Chief Justice Gary and concurred in
by all of the associate justices.
The action to secure the appropria?
tion was brought by the board of re?
gents. The attorney general held that
the money could not be paid out by
the comptroller general because the
item of $100,000 was not contained in
{the general appropriation bill and it
! was suggested that the matter ho car?
ried to the court for a decision.
'The recapitulation of the various
items in the act, which provides for
en . appropriation of $418,000 to the
hospital,'* says the decision, "also
tends to show that it was the inten?
tion'of the legislature to appropriate
$318,000 for maintenance and salaries
land $100,000 for rebuilding, other
[wise the item in the recapitulation
would have been only $818,000."
.Worlt on the proposed improve?
ments outlined by the board of re?
gents Will, be resumed immediately.
C. Fred Williams, M. D., superinten?
dent, said yesterday that the plans
call for the completion of all male

LAST OF THE ALLEN S.
Roauoke, Va,, March 18.?Jack
Allen, last of the famous AUen clan
of Carroll county, was shot and killed
last night in the home of Mrs. Ro?
berta Martin, five miles from Mount
Airy, N. C, by Will McCraw. On his
way home from Mount Airy, where
he sold a wagon load of lumber, Allen
stopped at Mrs. Martin's home to
spend the night After supper he and
Mrs. Martin and Mrs. Hattle House?
man, a neighbor, were sitting before
the fire talking. McCraw came in and
took part in the conversation. The
Allen trials were discussed. McCraw
asserted, it is said by the women, that
in his opinion Wesley Edwards, one of
ehe gang sent to the penitentiary for
shooting up the Carroll county sher?
iff, was not as courageous as people
thought he was. Angered by this state?
ment, Jack Allen is said to have re?
torted angrily, charging McCraw
with defaming a man behind his
back. Fearing trouble Mrs. Martin
cried out: "Don't, dont' have any
trouble here."
The words were scarcely spoken
when the two men rushed together,
gripping at each other's throat. The
women and their children ran from
the room screaming. Immediately af?
terwards a shot rang out followed by
another. McCraw, hatless and without
his overcoat, it is said, plunged from
the house and disappeared. Accompa?
nied by wagoners who were camping
in the neighborhood the family return?
ed to the house and there found Jack
Allen lying on the floor with a bullet
hole through his head.
Officers are hunting for McCraw,
who Is believed to be hiding with
friends in the mountains.
Allen was a brother of Floyd Allen,
who died in the electric chair, and of
Sidna Allen, now in the penitentiary.
After a coroner's jury this afternoon
had held McCraw responsible for the
shooting he was reported to have
sent word to the authorities that he
would surrender.
