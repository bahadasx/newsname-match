Conditions Point to Near Resump

The Jong-wished for movement,
of the ice iu the river began .Sun
day, and yesterday and today has
been so heavy that nobody ventur
ed into it. The water is up to the
high mark, again floating the old
ferryboat and the two new barges.
These are being saved from dam
age by the ice piling up on the
shore around them
The high water has been a lucky
thing for the new ferryboat, it hav
ing been left iri the water at the
bend above town. The ice has
been flowing past it several feet
away
But little timber or driftwood is
coming down and the ice is too
heavy for anybody to get any of it.
There was no eastern mail for
us Saturday evening, which oper
ated to deprive the Agcncy people
of their mail from that time to
this (Wed.) evening, an unusual

the one trip that the mail boat has
made in the last four days, viz: on
Monday, to get over to his job of
painting at the Agency.

get over to his clerkship at the
Agency owing to the break-up.
He missed his chance Monday aft
ernoon by being employed to as

'M call upon the schools and all
educational institutions the
stale to obscrye the day in spirit
and in fact by such appropriate
ceremonies and exercises as will
iittingly recognize its practical,
historic and esthetic significance,
and by actual planting in all con
venient places."

As it was, the ice and wind was
too much to be ventured. .into
Monday morning, and the quanti
ty of ice running since kept the
party on this side of the river till
Weduesdav afternoon.

antiseptic and healing. (Jet a 50c bottle
