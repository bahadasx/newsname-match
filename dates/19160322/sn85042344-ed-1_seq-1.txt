tiNlny t;cmral l'linsloii asked the department for what lie clmincteiliea nn an
"udeqiiule" fore'. '
It wu.s aiiiioiini'ed at General Fmistoii's headquarters that the Fifth cav
alry of whieh one squuclron Is at Fort Meyer, Va unother at Fort eaveu-'
iith, Kan., and tho third at Fort .Sheridan, Wyo., woull lw hiiuht to lliu
holder at mic-e and sent forward iilon ticneral IVrshiiiK's line of coimuuniea
tlon to t'asns (iia mil's. Whether he Iwd tthkod for inore tr.Kips (.eneral Fun
slon would not say.
The only reason given for Htrenictheiiine General TershliiR'n forfv, known
hy the public Kenerally to lie rousiileralily niori: than four thousand, was that
hi Held of operations had Ix-come ho extend' d t'lat his main line of comniind
caiion and the subsidiary linen were much weaker than they should he.
PHIXWL'TIOXARY MOV I".
'Merely a precautinnury move," was the way General Fiuistoii answered
all siiKlfestions as to his motives oilier tlian It was desired to strcnictlien the
lines, lie was asked If the rcHirted movement of troop of the de facto itov.
erninent from Kflrrisons in the Interior to posts on the border, and the failure
of the Carranzu troops In one or two Instances to show active co-oeration in
the pursuit of Villa, had anythiiiK to do with his decision to ask for more
strength, hut lie declined to answer.
Sonic little uneasiness was displayed for a moment at his headquarter
today when it was reported that the telegraph wlrrt between tiis;M Grandest
and the border had been cut, but an official rciwrt Plating that the line cut
was "a bn..cr" line General Pershing had laid, and that It had been broken
accidentally by some of the American forces crossing it, allayed apprehension.
VI1.MSTAS AIIK Xl MFKOl'S.
It Is not iH'lieved here that General Fnnston is "oirlcil to any extent by
reports of alleged growing antagonism among t'arrauxii troops although lio
Is carefully studying all reHrts, official am! unofficial, on that phase of the
situation. It lias not been forgotten at his headquarters, however, that Villa
has many more troops somewhere In norihcrn Mexico than the few hundred
said to lie riding with him in his flight Itcforc the pursuing troops of the two
countries. Iteall.ing the mobile character of Villa's bands it was not consid
ered wise to cKsc too much General Pershing's lines.
LuUe rtabicoru
towards which one
of his columns was reported yesterday
to be moving It utmost two hundred
miles from the border and hy the time
the columns directed towards Carmen
and Namaquipa arrive at their desti
nations they also will be almost as
far south. South of Casas Urandes
the cavalry detachments that are fol
lowing the trails Into the heart of the
country where Villa is Itnown to have
gone, are operating In a triangle of
approximately three thousand square
miles area.
May Take Kntire Army
The chase for Villa has grown
larger than evon military men who
.had studied the situation carefully,
helieved It would. It has assumed
the proportions of a campaign and It
Mas pointed out that if it became nec
essary to extend the operations much
more it might be necessary to move
into the field almost all tho remain
ing available forces of the regular
urmy. Thut statement eliminates
mine twenty thousand men now in the
southern department, the greater part
on duty In Texas. New Mexico and
Arizona along the Mexican border.
Oencral FuiiRton explained today that
ho could not well spare any of those
for tho operations In Mexico because
It was equally necessary to guard the
frontier. Scores of demands for pro
tection are being made at hlB heud
quarters by farmers and committees
from towns along the Mextco-Amcr
lean border.
These petitioners have earnestly In
sisted that they feared raiders fro'ii
across the boundary line, many of
them offering what appeared to them
as evidence that raids mWht be ex
pected. It has been Impossible In al
most all cases to shift the l'orvcs in
order to give them special protection,
hut General Funston does not care to
remove tho troops from their stations
that are within reach of the moro
populous centers along the frontier.
Kesimeiits in the f. S.
With tho exception of four and
one-third regiments of infantry, two
regiments of cavaliy and wlut
amounts to about a regiment and a
half of Held artillery, all troops of
the I'nlted Slates army ure either al
ready In the border territory and n
Mexico or are on foreign service. This
does not include the coast artillery
-corps or all engineer troops, signal
corps companies and field hospitals
and ambulance- companies.
Regiments left in tho I'nlted States,
exclusive of those in the southern de
partment and Mexico or on foreign
tours, are;
Second cavalry, Fort Ethan Allen
Vt.; Fifth cavalry, Fort Sheridan, Fort
Mever, Va., and Fort Leavenworth,
Kail.: Third Infantry, Madison bar-
- racks. N. Y., and Fort Ontario, N. Y.:
Fourteenth infantry, one battalion at
Fort Lawton, Wash.; Twenty-first in

Money for Funston.
General Funston was advised from
Washington today that $20,000 had
been placed to his credit for the pay
ment for tho services of guides, scouts,
interpreters and other civilians tt
might become advisable to employ. Al
ready General t'ershing is using many
Americans as scouts. They are men
said to be familiar with every trail and
waterhole in that part of Mexico.
The work of the scouts. It was ex
pected, would be supplemented by the
aviators, six of whom have arrived at
Casas Grandes. Lieutenant T. it.
Bowen who fell with his machine on
the flight from the border to Casas
Urandes, was only slightly injured,
according to an official report to Gen
eral Funston.
It was stated late today at General
Funston'a headquarters that no re
port from General Pershing regarding
tho operations against Villa south of
Casas Urandes, was received today.
Unofficial reports regarding Villa's
fight with Carranza's forces at Cruces
and Namaquipa south of (lalenna,
were vague nnd contradictory.
Whether the American column of
cavalry that was advancing south
ward on the trail leading to Cruces
encountered Vnla was merely a guess
at headquarters. '
Failure of the field wireless at
Casas Grandes was not regarded at
headquarters here as significant since
It has been "In trouble" a largo part
of the time. Frequently there have
been long intervals when tho oper
ators were unable to reach the station
on the frontier ond officers here to
night were inclined to believe that
this Interruption was due like the
others, to asmospherle conditions and
the weakness of the wireless set.
Late tonight It was stated at Gen
eral Funston's headquarters that. he
had not yet received any message
from I'ershing relative to the opera
tions beyond Casus Grandes.
