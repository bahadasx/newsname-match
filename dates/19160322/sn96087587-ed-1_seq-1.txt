Tennyson or Longfellow could take n worthless shoot of
paper, write a poem on it and make it worth :$G5,0J0 thnt's
gonitis. There nre some men who can write a tew words on
a sheot of paper and make it worth $5,000,000- that's capi
tal. The United States can take nn ounce nnd a quarter of
gold and stamp upon it an "ongle bird" and make it worth
$20 that's money. A mechanic can take material worth ?5
nnd mke it into watch springs worth JI. 000. 00 that's skill.
A merchant can take an article worth 75c and sell it for SI
that's business. A woman can purchase a 75c hat hut
prefers one that costs ?27. that's foolishness. A ditch dig
ger woiks 10 hours a day and handles several tons of earth
for $1.50-that's labor. The writer of this enn make out n
check for $90,000,000 hut it wouldn't he worth a dime--that's
rough. There ure lumber and hardware men in
