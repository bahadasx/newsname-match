THE NEGATIVE MR/STOEVER
Tacoma has had enough trimmers in its city council. What it
wants now is men of conviction—positive men—builders pur
poseful, do-something men.
That ii why the Rev. Mr. Stocvei' is peculiarly NOT the man
for the place he seeks.
Rev. Stoevev is purely a negative candidate. He has no pro
grab He has no ideas on city government, except the idea, "X
want office."
He refuses to commit himself on any subject. He has spoken
to many audiences this spring, and Wf defy any of his hearers to
RUSH MORE TROOPS TO BORDER
STONE & WEBSTER
MAKE A NEW DEAL
WITH TEXAS CITY
DALLAS, Tex., March 22.—Stone & Webster have agreed in
principle here 10 the idea of public MTVlce at <OHt.
This means that instead of striving further to make out of the
patrons of the street cars and of the electric li«ht company ALL that
they can make, they are willing to lie limited here by the city to a
fair return!
Dallas has heen handicapped for years by the fact that Its utili
ties were under limited term franchises which were drawing near
a close.
Stone & Webster would invest no further money because they
said they could not get It back.
TIIH STRKKT CAR SYSTEM STOOD PRACTICALLY STILL
WHILI THE TOWN DOVBLBO IN POPULATION.
Mayor Lindsley, who was elected in a utility regulation
< iitiipiii^n. inuile only one pledge. It MTfll ih.ii if he were

utilities d\ tb.> ablest iude|>endeiit <'\pcrt the city could en-
KiiKc- Hi* choice fell MM Prof. K. W. Iteinis, formerly hsso
i laird with Mayor Tom .lolinsoii ol Cleveland in Hie IriMW
reform activities.
Hemis' report fixed the value today of the Dallas street cur lines
east of the river and of the electric plant ut some seven millions of
dollars. His figures and those of Stone & Webster agreed us to unit
values and quantities.
He rluii I'd off 25 per cent for depreciation. Stone & Webster
would not allow a cent for depreciation though the supreme court
In the Knoxvtlle water and other cases said a "substantial" amount
should be charged off on this account.
Stone & Webster Have 13y 2 Million in
Securities Outsanding Against Plants
THIS MADK A DIFFERKNCIO OK AHOI'T TWO MILLIONS OK
DOLLARS BETWEEN HK.MIS AND BTONI & WEBSTER.
The latter also wanted to charge 8 per cent on the total for the
cost of raising the money with which they went into business in
Dallas, and in all .'lt! per cent for 'overhead."
Dr. Beinls would not allow them a cent for the cost of raising
the money and fixed all their "overhead" at IB per cent.
Stone it Webster control the utilities through the Dallas Electric
Co. of Maine, a holding company. It has against the utilities no less
than 13V4 million dollars of securities.
Mayor I.indsley proposed that on the seven million dollars value
Stone ft Webster should be allowed to earn annually se\eu per cent
on the light plant values and six per cent on the traction values, the
return to be cumulative as to one per cent annually.
With this return on this capital allowance and upon all new
money put in, he offered them an indeterminable franchise, deter
minate for in years, with the general clause that as net profits in
creased rates wete to go down. IN OTIIKR WORDS, SERVICE AT
COST.
Notice That City in S. & W.s Control
Has to Pay 10 Cents a Kilowatt for Light
As to lights this meant an immediate reduction to the average
householder from 1(1 cents a kilowatt to eight cents, with further
rapid reductions likely.
As to street cars, it means six for a quarter tickets at the start
as against straight five cent fare, and fare reductions down as low
as two cents, if profits warranted it.
Of course the city Is to control both utilities. Extensions and
developments are taken care of in the ordinance, aB well ns character
of service, and there is a clause governing purchase by the city or by
outsiders.
At any rate, Italia* voters on April I undoubtedly will
wfile Into their city charter the principle* of awvtat for cost
' TTn against the present archaic font* per cent uross receipt*
cljiiisc and other out of date protective rtaMM against fran
chise grabbers.
Mayor Liudsley says of the Dallas situation:
"We propose to protect capital as it exists ami as it will he in
vested. We propose a reasonable rate of return on this capital. We
propose to protect this capital when it quits. WE PROPOSE ALSO
THAT, AS THE PROFITS FROM THE EMPLOYMENT OF THIS
CAPITAL INCREASE, THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES SHALL REAP
THE BENEFIT.

LIQUID FIRE DRIVES
FRENCH LINES BACK
LONDON, March If.—-Liquid
fire played its most Important i
role since the war began when it
enabled the Germans to advance
10 miles toward Verdun.
Reports reaching London to
day said that Herman artillery
showered shrapnell and high ex
plosives on the Flench position*
at Avocourt unsuccessfully.
,/ets of liquid flame and billows
of smoke drove the French from
several hundred yards of trenches
southeast of Miilincourt. This
menaced several square miles of
French position northwest of Ver
dun.

Both the Tacoma and the In
dianapolis are running on sched

said.

"I sent Reveral of the men to
Seattle, because there Is more
trouble over there and they
might need the men. As far as

convenience to the public. It is
impossible for me to predict when
the strike will end."
