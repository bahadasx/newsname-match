Federalization of National
Guard
is the Question
Discussed.
Washington, March 32.—Senator
Lawrence Y. Sherman, of Illinois, re
publican, introduced. the resolution to
authorize and direct the president im
mediately to call for 50,000 volunteers
for service in Mexico.
Under the rules, the resolution lies
on the table until, tomorrow.
House Debate.
The debate in the house on the army
ttill immediately developed opposition
.o the proposal to put the national
guard under federal control. Repre
sentative Fields, democrat, of Ken
tucky, asserted. that the court deci
sions showed the guard could not be
federalized without a constitutional
amendment. Representative Wilson,
republican, of Connecticut^ a mem
ber of the committee, offered an
amendment specifying oaths of en
listment for officers, men of national
guard, and providing obligation to
both federal and state governments,
and the federal right to their service
to precede that of the state. The com
mittee believed, he said, that this
would accomplish the measure of fed
eralization sought.

Paris, Tex., March 22.—A conser
vative estimate of the number of .peo
ple made homeless by last night's fire
In the business districts, here was
8,000.. This estimate was made by
Mayor Ed McCulstion.
Although the city is without food
there is apparently little suffering.
The property loss is approximately
$3,000,000. Between 1,500 and 2,000
dwellings are destroyed, in addition
to the big business blocks.
Rumors are vague but persistent,
that a' number of pieople have lost
their lives. Confirmation, however,
is lacking and while, considering the
property damage, it seemed miracul
ous there should -have been no deaths.
The opinion of those best informed
is that no person met death.
Homeless Cared For.
Thousands of homeless men, wom
en and Children are' being cared tor
as best as possible, irt the remaining
residences, railway stations and the
few remaining public buildings. The
question of making- definite arrange
ments for handling the large number
of unfortunates was.-taken up by the
city authorities and an emergency
committee of leading citizens. The
food supply is the most .serious prob
lem.' Every hotel, restaurant and
grocery In the city has been destroyed.
The wind, which wm blowing a
gale when the fire started, and which
abated considerably shortly after,
midnight, shifted at daylight, and the
fire Is slowly traveling in a southerly
direction spreading, -the. flames
throughout the southern residenoe
district, but in a freakish manner,
they are Jumping whole blocks in its
progress.
Help Arrives.'
Fire fighting apparatus from Dallas,
Greenville and other- nearby cities is',
assisting the local department in
bringing the flames under control.
$&,OOe,OOO Damage.
The recapitulation ..of the damage
done by the fire is indicated that the
total .would pass the five million dol
Jar mark.
