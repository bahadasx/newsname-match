March Chill Will Not Last
Many Hours, Weather
Man Prophesies.
STIFF WIND BLOWS
High Velocity Is Due to Rap
id Movement of Low
Pressure Center.
.March became leonine yesterday
and continued so this morning.
Early today the wind at one time
reached a elocity of forty-four mifes
an hour. This was during the five
minute period, r:2.". to .1:30 o'clock,
when the wind blew at the rate of
forty miles or more.
The high velocity was due to an
unusually rapid movement of a low
pressure center, said the weather bu
reau today. The low pressure center
fell from Wyoming on the west to Penn
sylvania on the east. It passed Co
lumbia about 0:20 o'clock last night,
ending at 7 o'clock this morning. At
midnight last night it had reached a
speed of about thirty miles an hour.
Velocitj Near a Record.
The velocity of the wind today was
the highest registered here since April
10, 1515, when it reached forty miles
an hour. February 2S, 1914, the wind
blew forty-two miles an hour for a
five-minute period. On an average of
about once a year the wind blows at
this speed here, usually during the
winter months.
Some damage was done to the Co
lumbia telephone sj.stem last night,
most of it being on the lines out of
Columbia. The St. Louis and Jeffer
son City toll lines were out of com
mission for a while this morning, but
they are operating now. The Mc
Baine toll line is out of service to
day, owing to breaks. Telegraph serv
ice received no damage.
TeniiK-rature Hits High Mark.
The temperature also came close to
hanging up a record for March yes
terday. The highest degree registered
was SG, this being the highest since
Marcii 27. 1907, when the mercury
soared to 92 degrees. Only one other
time in the twenty-six year history of
the weather bureau here has the rec
ord of yesterday been equaled. This
was on March 22, lS'JO, when the 90
degree mark was reached.
The weather bureau said today that
the present cold spell would be of
short duration, ending as soon as the
low pressure center had completely
passed.
