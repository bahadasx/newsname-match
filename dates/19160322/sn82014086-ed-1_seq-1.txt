Austro-Italian Line Are in Progress, With No Important
Changes Chronicled.
In their attempts to flank Verdun on

Malancourt wood and the Avocourt
wood have begun a heavy bombard
ment of the village of Esnes, about
eight miles northwest of Verdun and
Hill 304 which lies about a mile and a
half north of Esnes.
The French, however, are vigorously
contesting a further advance eastward,
which not alone would bring the
German line nearer the fortress, but,
spreading fan-like northeastward,
would put in jeopardy the French in
the region of Le Mort Homme.
So great has been the counter of
fensive of the French guns thatk after
debouching fro mthe woods, the" Ger
mans were unable to launch an In
fantry attack and presumably are be
ing held hard to their newly gained
lines.
To the north and east of Verdun
the cannonading has been only inter
mittent. In the Argonne Forest, in
Lorraine and in upper Alsace the
French guns have been active against
Germa n positions and marching
columns. On the river Somme the
Germans entered a" British trench but
immediately were driven out.
There has been lively fighting be

SERIOUSNESS OF THE
FREIGHT BLOCKADE
New England Factories Closing Un-
able to Get Supplies.
New York, March 21. Because of
the seriousness of the freight block
ade in New England, where factories
are reported to be closing because of

cities tomorrow to study the situatoin
at close range and devise remdias.

every railroad in the eastern congest
ed territory, showing the condition of
their lines as of midnight on Monday.
It is expected that this information

meeting of the full committee, called
for Thursday.
To relieve the shortage of box crrs

greatly needed, for the movement of
empties has begun from eastern poi-its.
It is hoped to release a large propor
tion of the 100,000 cars owned by west
ern roads now tied up in' eastern ter
Itorty. To aid in raising the blockade, which
the association says is seriously inter
fering with the foreign commerce of
this port, an appeal has been issued to
all shippers to use combmon sense in
dealing with the situation and not to
complicate matters by demanding more
cars than they need.

A FURTHER ADVANCE
Dvinak and Vilna with the Russians
generally on the offensive.
While Berlin reports these attacks
as having been repulsed with heavy
losses, the admission Is made that a
German salient near Lake Naroche
was withdrawn in order to escape the
encircling of the Russians.
Near Butzitisxskt, midway between
Dvinsk and Vilna, the Russians have
capturd advanced German trenches
and Just south of Dvinsk, in the region
of Novo Alexandrovsk, have repulsed
a German counter-attack on positions
taken at Velikoieselo.
Jetrograd says that in the capture of
the Austrian bridgehead near the vil
lage of Mlkhalche, in Galicia, most of
its defenders were killed in hand-to-hand
fighting.
The Russians in the Caucasus have
thrown their line several miles nearer
Trebizond on the Black Sea const
after further fighting with the Turks.
Ispaham, Persia, is reported to have
been taken by the Russians.
Heavy fighting continues between
th Austrians and Itaians along the
greater part of the Austro-Italian line,
especially on the front from Roverto
to the Gorizia heights. No important
chances in positions have taken pluee.
A successful night attack by Austro
Hungarlan aviators has been enrried
out against the port and barracks of
Avlona, Albania, according to Vienna.
I NO NEWS FROM
TROOPS IN MEXICO.
Nothing Known of Result of Battle
Between Carranza and Villa Forces.
El Paso, Tex., March 21. In the ab
sence of any news from either General
Pershing or General Gavira, there was
nothing left today but conjecture as
to the result of the fighting between
Carranza and Villa forces, said to have
occurred near Namiquipa. There was
a strong belief that Villa was not per
sonally involved in whatever fighting
had occurred. It seemed reasonably
certain that the bandit chief could not
have been at Namiquipa and at the
various places at wmcn ne was placed
in aavices to uenerai uavira during
the task.
If it is true that Villa clashed at
Namiquipa with Carranaz troops in a
general oattle in which he was de
feated. It appears highly probable that
by this time his followers have come
m contact with the American columns.
tne advance guard or the Americans '
was reported at El Valleia, only 35 I
miles from Namiquipa. It is not be- !
lieved. however, that Villa would rik
an open fight with General Pershing's I
troops, but instead would split his men
into small parties and indulge in his ;
ftavorite guerilla tactics. i
