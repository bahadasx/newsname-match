The terrors of the Villa hunt were

dropping dead from exhaustion.
Other members of the aeroplane

cause of their mishaps or the fate ot
the two aviators was unknown here.
The American cavalry rushing to

ed to have passed El Valle within
twenty-four hours forced march of
Villa. If the outlaw has not escaped
Into the wild Santa Clara mountains,
United States troops ought to be In

[By Chas. P. Stewart. United Press
Staff Correspondent]
LONDON, March 22.—'Liquid Are
played its most successful role since
the beginning of the war in the com
bats In which the Germans pushed*
forward, ten miles northwest of Ver
dun, according to dispatches received
here today.
The German artillery bombardment
in Avoc a if In
effective, Paris reported. It was the
Jets of flame bursting In long red
tongues from billows of smoke that
drove the French from several hun
dred yards of positions In the woods
southwest of Malaneourt.
The success of the Germans In this
new offensive. It Is admitted here,
menaces several square miles of
French positions northwest of Ver
dun. The latest dispatches from Paris,
however, Insist that the shifting of
the German attack is only a confes
sion of failure. The news of the Rus
sian victories on the eastern front
convinces the Paris critics that the
Verdun offensive of the crown prlnoo
must soon be abandoned.
In their rush Into ^rocourt wood,
the Germans fought their way to with
in seven miles of St. Mtenehould, Ver
dun railway, over which the French
Verdun armies obtain most of their
supplies. The German front at this
point now links up with the Argonne
front around Vauquols. If the Ger
mans fail to squeeze the French out
of the northwestern positions of Ver
dun, they may smash southward In an
attempt to seize this railroad.
Infantry fighting around Malan
eourt and Avocourt came to a halt
yesterday morning. The Germans
continued a heavy bombardment,
shelling the village of Esnes, a hlgh
vmy junction, and leaving little doubt
as to their intentions of renewing
the attack.
Dispatches from the correspondent
of the cologne Gazette offer what
may be an explanation of the dispute
between the French and German war
offices over possession of Dead Man
hill. The German correspondent as
serted that the Germans hold Hill
265 and Hill 295, but he admitted that
since the publication of French war
maps, the French may have erected
new defenses on the ridge behind
these hills, designating the position
••Dead Man hill."

Dton's request for more troops. The
army's field telegraph constructed
along the line of march has repeatedly
been cut and rendered practically
worthless. These repairs have taken
so much of the signal corps time that
the wire have only been strung for a
distance of thirty or forty miles,
Villistas had cut the Mexico North
western's telegraph lines In nearly
thirty different places, leaving the
Juarez authorities without word of
the movement of the United States
troops or the battle reported raging
near Namiqulpa yesterday between
Colonel Cano's Carranza forces and
Villa's men. A brief wireless from
Pershing yesterday reported the Vil
listas beaten and retreating to the
Santa Clara canyon.
If two other American columns on
either side of the forces which left
El Valle were racing toward the bat
tlefield to engage Villa, as reported,
the three American cavalry squadrons
were out of sight and touch with each
other. The column reported going to

from the El Valle squadron by the
Oriental range of the Sierra Madres,
while the Santa Clara range cut off
