EL PASO, Mar. 22. Although It la sixty hours since General Pershing
reported regarding the disposition of the cavalry south of Casas (Irandes, Gen

WASHINGTON, Mar. 22. The pre

ful of the stories that Ambassador

about to make a move for peace. A
White House statement is given out:
"The president, through Seccrtary
Tumulty, has authorized the denial of
stories appearing In the newspapers
to the effect that the purpose of Ger

Germany's proposal for peace. There
is no Justification for that inference
being drawn."
The "stale department also denied
that Germany had Intimated it de
sired the United States to act as a
mediator for peace or in anyway sug
gested that the United States' should
take up the question with other
powers. Confidential reHrts to the
president from ambassadors to belli
gerent countries are understood to in
dicate no more prospects of peace
than at any time in bIx monthH. All
the belligerents, it is understood, are
ready for peace on their own terms.

A second time within a few months the commissioners of Nye '
county, who had a year ago a fat treasury, find they have expended all j
the county's money In the funds below specified and must have more
at once, "great necessity" having arisen. When they secured perrala-
sion last fall to borrow $17,600 they spent a considerable fraction of
that amount sending the editor and manager of this paper to Jail for
telling the public about it. Now they have run the county out of
money again and want $20,000 more. This paper will, in its future com-
ments on the episode, be very careful to use the word "alleged" and
make no reference to any oleagenous substance being employed. . It
will also "except" to any legal proceedings that may be employed to
separate the taxpayers of Nye from any portion of this $20,000 that is
not used for the benefit of the people. Following is the resolution

CANTON, China, Mar. 22. Not
withstanding the reports of revolu
tionary victories in Szechuen which
are reaching Canton, this city is
very quiet and at present there is
little to indicate that Kwantung pro

Chl-kwang, the military governor, has
a tight grip on affairs and is loyal
to the Peking government. As long
as he remains bo, there seems to be
little danger of any extensive trou
ble In Canton. Halt of the troops
commanded by General Lung are
Huanese. He has kept these
separated from the other troops
which make up the rest of his forces
and so far the Uunnnese have not
made .any decided move to Join the
movement against th Peking govern
ment Instituted by Yunnan province.
Canton, even In normal times, is a
turbulent center. Uomb-throwing Is
common In this city, and the govern
ment Is constantly on the look-out for
smugglers, who bring In explosives.
Consequently General Lung lives In
a bomb-proof yamen and Is practically
a prisoner, as he does not dare to
move about the cl'y without taking
every precaution to protect himself
against persona in sympathy with the
movement against Yuan Shl-kal.
Canton is the great trading center
of south China, and the opinions of
the merchants may generally be Judg

PARIS, Mar. 22 All the known

at the outset of the war, but the
prolongation of hostilities has proven
too much for the patience of sporting

petty gambling now taking larger
