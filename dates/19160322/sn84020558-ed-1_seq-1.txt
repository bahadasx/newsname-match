WASHINGTON, March 21 Although
rapid progress was made in the house
today with the Hay army increase bill,
it was found impossible to reach a vote
before adjournment. It may be passed
tomorrow "calendar Wednesday," hav
ing been set aside to permit its unin
terrupted consideration.
In the senate Chairman Chamberlain
of the military committee, now plans
to call up his army bill tomorrow. He
had expected the house bill to be com
pleted today and was waiting for it,
but concluded tonight that they would
be saved by attempting to take up the
senate measure at once.
Several important amendments were
made to the Hay bill during the day.
With one exception, they were approved
by Chairman Hay of the military com
mittee. After defeating a proposal by
Representative Kahn, ranking minority
member of the committee, to permit ef
ficient regular soldiers be discharged
into the reserve in one year on recom
mendation of their commanders or in
two years on their own motion, the
house reversed its action and put
through a similar amendment by Rep
resentative Gardner, republican of Mas
sachusetts, over Representative Hay's
opposition. The senate bill contains
such a provision
The most important amendment was
, the insertion of the reserve officers'
training scheme proposed by Repre
sentative Card, of Ohio, democrat,
which has been increased in the sen
ate bill. It provides that military in
structors be supplied by the war de
partment to any civil educational in
stitution with an available student
body of 100 or more and where a mil
itary course satisfactory to the war de
partment is established. A sufficient
number of graduates would be desig
nated for six months additional train
ing were the regular army to main
tain a corps of fifty thousand reserve
officers.
Another amendment accepted, offer
ed by Representative Kahn would per
mit the president to order out the reg
ular army reserve without going to con
gress for authority. The contemplated
strength of the reserve is 60,000 and as
the bill now stands, the president could
increase the regular army from its
peace strength of 140,000 to a strength
of 235,000 by executive order if war
seemed imminent.
The last amendment adopted was

eight miles northwest of Verdun and
Hill 304 which lies about a mile and

The French, however, are vigorous

not alone would bring the German

WASHINGTON, March 21. The Till
man bill to provide for the erection or
purchase by the government of an ar
mor plate factory at a cost not to ex
ceed $11,000,000 was passed by the sen
ate late today by a vote of 58 to 23. The
house naval committee has set aside
tomorrow for consideration of the
measure with a view to reporting it to
the house promptly.
Democratic senators supported the
bill solidly, regarding it as one of the
important measures included in the na- '
tional preparedness program now being
hastened to completion. Nine progres
sive republicans joined with the major
ity in voting for the bill. They were
Senators Borah, Clapp, Cummins, Gro
na, Kenyan, Norris, I'oindexter, Sterl
ing and Works.
Passage of the measure in the house
is regarded as assurred. Administra-,
tion leaders are planning to bring it
up soon after passage of the army re
organization and immigration bills.
The bill, which has the approval of
the administration and Secretary Dan

publican senators. At committee hear

Bethlehem and Midvale Steel compan

furnished armor to the government, ap

their plants would have to be disman

in upon the business, leaving no source
of supply for the navy's immediate
needs. The opposition in the senate
was led by Senators Penrose, Oliver,
Lippitt and Lodge.
As general debate closed today the
test vote on the issue came when Sen

BONHAM, Tex., March 21. At least '
sixty per cent of the residential and
business district of Paris, Tex., 30
miles from here had been destroyed at
midnight tonight by the fire which
started late this afternoon, according
to reports here. No casualties have
been reported.
The fire which started shortly after
5 o'clock in the extreme southern por
tion of the city, has left a funnel shaped
wake of destruction, two blocks wide at
the start, and from eight to ten bloks
wide where the fire was raging at mid
night. The suffering in Paris is great, ac
cording to reports from there. The de
struction of practically every mercan
tile establishment has cut off the food
supply and unless food and clothing is
sent in from outside points there will
be keen distress.
Paris has a population of about 20,000
of which forty percent are negroes. It
was estimated that at least 5,000 per
sons were without shelter or food.
Residents have been so busy in com
batting the flames, according to word
here, that they have given little thought
to succoring the homeless and desti
tute. The damage is estimated at be
tween l,7.r0,000 and $2,000,000.
Every able-bodied citizen was at
work tonight in a fireman's role, either
participating in bucket brigades with
a none too plentiful water supply, or as
sisting in manning fire fighting appar
atus rushed there from Dallas, Honey
Grove and Bonham, Tex., and Hugo,

Prospects of getting the fire under
control before early morning were con
sidered slight at midnight.
By regular channels of communica
tion, Paris was entirely isolated to
night except for one railroad telegraph
wire.
The structures of two national and
one state bank, the Paris postoffice,
the Lamar county court house, the
Paris high school building, three
churches, the two Paris newspapers

to the list of destroyed buildings late
tonight.

S. Expeditionary Force
Republtcan A. P. Leased Wire
SAN ANToNIO, March 21. General
Frederick Funston asked the war de
partment today for more troops to
send into Mexico, only after lung con
sideration of the advisability of eon-
inuing the operations against Fran-
isco Villa with the forces now com
manded by General Pershing. Gen
eral Pershing suggested yesterday
hat another regiment be sent to him
nd today General Funston asked the
department for what lie character
ized as an adequate force.
It was announced at General Fun
ston s headquarters that the nrtn
cavalry, of which one squadron is at
Fort Meyer, Va., another at Fort
Leavenworth, Kris., and the third at
"ort Sheridan, 111., would tie brought
to the border at once and sent for
ward along General Pershing's line
communication to. Casas Grandes.
The only reason given for strength-
ning General Persuing s iorces.
tiotvn by the public generally to lie
considerably more th:in 4,0011, was that
is field of operations had become so
extended that his main line of com
munication and the subsidiary lines
ere much weaker than they
should he.
"Merely a precautionary measure,"
was the way General funston an
swered all questions.
Some uneasiness was displayed for
moment at his headquarters today
when it was reported that the tele
graph wires between Casas Grandes
nd the border had been cut, but an
fficial report stating that the line
cut was a "buzzer" line General Per
shing had laid, and that it had been
broken accidentally by some of the
American forces crossing it, allayed
pprehension.
It is not believed here that General
Funston is worried to any great ex
tent by reports of alleged growing
antagonism among Cnrrnnza troops,
although he is carefully studying all
reports, official and unofficial, on
that phase of the situation.
It has not been forgotten at his
headquarters, however, that Villa ha
many more troops somewhere in
northern Mexico than the few hun
dred said to be riding with him on
his flight before the pursuing troops
of the two countries. Realizing the
mobile character of Villa's bands, it
was not considered wise to expose too
much of General Pershing's lines.
Lifke Babricoca, towards which one
of his columns was reported yester
day to be moving, is almost 200 miles
from the border, and by the time
the columns directed towards Carmen
and Namiquipa arrive at their destin
ations they also will be almost as far
south. South of Casas Grandes the
cavalry detachments thaf are follow
ing the trails into the heart of the
country where Villa is knowfi to have
gone are operating in a triangle of
approximately 3,000 square miles area
The chase for Villa has assumed the
proportions of a campaign and it was
pointed out that if it became neces
cary to extend the ope.ntions much
more, it might be necessary to move
into the field almost all the remaining
available forces of the regular army.

WASHINGTON, March 21.
General Pershing, leading the
American expeditionary forces in
Mexico, reported to the war de
partment today that he had
reached a point near Villa and
his outlaws. It was made clear
in the dispatch that General
Pershing believed the troops of
the de facto government were co
operating in the bandit hunt and
that it is quite possible Villa may
be trapped. Officials continued to
assert today that all dispatches
to the war and state departments
told of cooperation between the
American and Carranza forces,
and of generally favorable condi
tions in the interior of Mexico and
along the border.
Unofficial dispatches which pic
tured a very different situation
were brought to the attention of
Secretary Baker, who said that
while the situation was fraught
with many possibilities, so far
there had been no unfortunate de
velopments. One of General Pershing's reports
tonight said the attitude of the na
tives continued friendly. Mr. Baker,
in referring to this, explained that
the department had no information to
indicate that a single hostile shot had
been fired against or by the the
American troops since they entered
Mexico.
While acting Secretary Polk of the
state department and Ellseo Arredon
do, Mexican ambassador-designate,
were conferring during the day over
the terms of the protocol proposed
by General Carranza to govern the
joint pursuit of Villa, the war depart
ment was ordering additional troops
to the border in response to a request
from General Funston. The Fifth
cavalry, the squadrons of which are
stationed at Fort Myer, Va.; Fort
Sheridan, 111., and Fort Leavenworth,
Kas., and the Twenty-fourth infantry
at Fort D. A. Russell, Wyo., were or
dered to entrain immediately. The
point to which the troops will move
was not disclosed.
A squadron of the Second cavalry
at Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont, will
he sent to Fort Myer to supplement
the garrison there.
Mr. Arredondo conferred at length
with Mr. Polk after President Wilson
and his cabinet had decided to accept
the proposal for a protocol. Later it
was said that the terms of the pro
posed convention virtually had been
agreed upon and that it was quite,
probable it would be in force within
a few days.
It is understood that it is proposed
to have the agreement cover questions
as to how many American troops
shall enter Mexico, how far into Hie
country they shall penetrate, methods
of co-operation and the use of rail
roads for military purposes. Mr. Ar

given complete instructions by his
government and for that reason it is
