DENISON FAVOR
ABLY CONSIDERED
Committee Representing Interests
Baptists of Iowa Visits Den
ison and Views College.
reprei
A committee Representing the col
lege interests of the Baptists of Iowa
visited Denison on Friday morning
with a view of canvassing Denison as
a suitable place for the location of a
college, which is to be located at
some point in Iowa in the near future.
Not long ago the Baptist colleges at
Pella and Des Moines were consolidat
ed with the understanding that the
assets of the two colleges were to be
combined and a college located at
some point in Iowa to be selected by
a committee representing the Des
Moines and Pella interests, in con
junction with a committee from the
American Baptist association.
These three interests were repre
sented by the committee which visit
ed Denison on Friday morning. A
committee from the Commercial club,
made up of eight or ten active mem
bers of the club, met the visiting com
mittee and took* charge of them on the
arrival of the early morning train
Automobiles were provided and a con
siderable time spent in driving about
the city and out to the college grounds
and other points of interest, aftei
which the members of the several com
mittees returned to the Commercial
club rooms and spent an hour or more
in considering the merits of the prop
ositions which Denison offers in the
way of buildings and grounds for |0'
eating the' Baptist college.
Our people were told by the commit
tee that the object was not to! secure
money alone and indeed, that was
:tJ
(not
to be the chief consideration in gov
crning the committee in its determi
nation to locate the prospective col
lege, but
that
the prime object was to
flrfd a location' Where the largest num
ber of people could be accommodated
Denison seems to offer inducements
growing out of the fact that a large
territory, embracing Minnesota, South
Dakota and eastern Nebraska, as well
as the state of Iowa, could be accom
modated here and no other point in
Iowa which has been considered of
fers superior inducements to Deni
son in these respects.
The fact of the large number of
churches in Denison and the amicable
relations between the several church
es. apueAled to the committee, and the

ison and the general moral standing
are what they are, also impressed the
committee. -The college grounds and
'buildings are offered to the Baptist
association free of charge and we
think, on the whole, the committee
left Denison with a very favorable Im
pression of our city and community
and the feeling prevails that, if the
considerations which the committee
claimed is to govern in the selection
of a place for the college, that Denison
will stand a fair show to win the
school.

DENISON STANDS PAIR CHANCE
Offers College, aiid Grounds to Com
mittee Seeking! Location—General
Moral Standing Commented Upon
The Des' Moines interests were rep
resented by Mr. Hunn, a prominent
lawper'of Des Moines tire Pella Inter
ests by Mr. Dunn, of Central City,
Iowa, and the general interests of the
church by Mr. F. Peleford, of Boston.
This committee, after viewing the sev
eral points offered for the location of
the college, will make a report to the
general committee at Des Moines,
whep the matter will be disposed of
and «-fcite selected.
We cherish the hope that Denison
will win in the contest because the
arguments in favor of the city aru
conclusive and unanswerable.
SPECIAL SESSION OF COURT
A special session of the court-was
held on yesterday, Judge Albert com
ing in the mortilng and spending the
day in disposing, of matters which
were left over at the close of the Jan
uary term. Practically a full day was
occupied in dealing with propositions
growing out of the sale of the farm of
Christian Suhr under foreclosure of a
mortgage had a year ago or more by
the Dunlap State bank, of Dunlap,
Iowa, vs Christian 'Suhr and wife. The
property was sold under execution on
the 24th of March, 1915, and the de
fendants were in court seeking .to have
annulled the proceedings In the case
from the beginning. Motion after
motion had btten filed of late attack
ing the proceedings at every stage
since the inception of the case. Af
ter a full and complete hearing by the
court, the regularity of the proceed
ings were sustained and* the various
motions interposed by the defendants
were overruled.
During the day the court found time
to consider the motion for a new trial
in the case of Charles J. Johnson vs
The City of,Denison et al and before
adjournment overruled the motion and
judgment wilt therefore be rendered
in favor of the plaintiff, from which
an appeal is likely to follow. The case
from the beginning has' presented
some/ novel questions and questiritis
that really should be passed upon by
the supreme court.
Some other matters of less import
ance were disposed of by the court
and an adjournment was had at five
o'clock and the judge returned to his
home at Jefferson on the evening
train.

Mr!. Tobin's lecture was illustrated
with lantern slides, he having more

however.
It was explained that the govern

facts oil tha. people of Iowa, namely:
the benefits to be derived from good
roads, and the methods of financing v,„
the improvement. He told of the
three
and disadvantages of each. Mr. To

The train was made up of a bag

The government representatives ex

The Geo. Menagh company are an
nouncing a review of spring styles,
displayed by pretty models, together
with a musical program, which will be
carried out at the Germania opera

nings of next week. A style show is
has been the custom for the big de
partment stores in the cities to put
on such an exhibition for the past few
years, the expense connected with
such a show has always beqn consid
ei*ed too large for the merchants in
towns the size of Denison to under
take. Not so for the Geo. Menagh
company, however, for they only re
cently put on a big style show at the
Brandeis theater in Oniaha, which
|^^"ended by^Imosf three. thousand
common methods of bonding for good *n nnn
roads, and explained the advantages Jce&s
that the5, have
decided to con-
duct a similar one here in Denison.
The style show in Omaha was a most
novel one and unlike anything ever
held in that city before.
Mr. James Menagh, manager of the
Denison store, informs us that the
jshotv in Denison will equal that put
on in Omaha in every respect. A. num
ber cf beautiful young ladies who act
cd as models for the show in Omaha
will take part in the style show in
Denison Monday and Tuesday eve
nings, and the women of Denison and
surrounding territory will have an op
portunity to see the latest styles of
women's wearing apparel. Originals
and copies from the following famous
dressmakers will be, shown: Worth,
Armand, Jenny, Brandt, Caillot, Lan
vin and others. All of the garments,
dresses, will be taken from the stock
of the Denison store and the shoes
and millinery worn will be matched
from the departments of the store.
The entertainment will be. free to
all ladies who wish to attend. Tickets
for the entertainment can be secured

Plans and Specifications for Pump
House, Pump, Water Mains, Etc.
The city dads met at the city hall
Monday evening to discuss the new
deep wfell and the purchasing of the
necessary pumps and equipment. for
getting the water into the standpipe.
Consulting engineer J. G. Thorne, of
Clinton, has recommended to the coun
cil that an.air lift be used to raise
the water from the deep well. He ad
vises the using of the two shallow
wells for reservoir purposes, and
that a water main be laid from
reservoir on the lots belonging to the
city just north of the municiple plant
and that a' water main be laid from
this reservoir up Washington Ave.,
to the standpipe. It is estimated that
the-air lift, water pump, electric mo
tors, concrete reservoir, pump house,
including water mains, fire hydrants
and pump pits will cost. about
W. H. Gray & Bros., who had the
contract for drilling the new deep
well have rendered a bill for the. work

amount is in accordance with the con
tract entered into by the city and W.

These scales will be used to weigh the

scales.they will be-able to tell which

A rare treat is in store for our citi

when Hon. Leslie M. Shaw \yill ad-'

always been Mr. Shaw's good fortune,

to have a crowd limited only by the
capacity of the hall where he has spok

Saturday night will be delivered to
such an audience. On another page
of this paper will be found an edi

which reference is made to Shaw's
