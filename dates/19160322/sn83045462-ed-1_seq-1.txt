.
"V'-h grt your wife t-? make out a
statement of what it cost to keep house
when you two were first married." lie
said, "and then have her mark down
the prices of some of the things you
need now."
Beans and Hominy Cheapest.
"The cheapest thing we ran get to
eat to bring tip the children." said the
gravedigger, "is navy beans and
hominy. I remember when beans were
v rents a quart, and now they are
rents a quart."
Krorn bis forty a month the gravedigger
pays $* a . for a "house"
near Falls t'hurrh: because it is a long
dista ore to ins w ork of digging graves
he pays a month for carfare. < >ut
of the remainder. SL'T a month, he has
to get the beans and loon in y - never
meat?and the cloth'*:- and the education
a.jid the fun for his wife and his
two children, a boy and a girl.
"Ho you have a carden?" asked one
of the members of the committee.
"Yes." said the big gravedigger. "f
have, but there is little time left for
gardening after I have gone to work
at a quarter to 7 and corne home after
"> o'clock. And a fellow hasn't much
strength left, digging in that hard
clay."
He looked down, unconsciously, at
his shoes, which were in reality no
shops a? all just leakine- leather i.oln
from vvhi'h The seams had gone long
ago.
Eight Years Without Raise.
'Those Arlington graves are hard
craves." he said, "and in winter the;.
* re awful hard. We have five graves
there today to dig: look at it raining
r?ut there. I have been up to m> knees
in mud and water mai*y and many a
time, digging graves, for the sake of
my Two ?.-hildren and the wife. What
1-hame.is there for gardening?
Jod knows if it were not for tip* w ife
taking m a bit of sewing we would not
liave lived. Eight years I ha\e been
there, and when I would ask them for a
raise they would say to mm 'Well, you
ktiow what you ran do f you don't like
it." '*
He said a "rich lady" had helped "the
wife" for the past two years.
He spoke for all the employes of the
Arlington cemetery, although a committee
had already appeared and made
brief statement, and had left a petition.
Somehow this big. raw boned
<.oung man. w;th the strength of a giant,
it appeared, got beneath the surface of
the committee.
"It would seem pretty had." mused
Representative Nolan in t'a corridor
after the hearing. "That this great lug
