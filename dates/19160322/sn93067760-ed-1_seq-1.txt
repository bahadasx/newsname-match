ants Found Not Guilty. Court Ad.
journed Naturday Morning.
The court of general sessions ad
journed sine die Saturday after hav
ing a busy week in which fifteen cases
were tried and fourteen convictions re
suilted.
Stobo Bailey, charged with the mur
der of the Barksdale woman in Youngs
township several weeks ago when such
acommotion was created among the
negro population, was tried the lat
ter part of the week, found guilty and
sentenced to the electric chair on
Friday, April 28th.
The case of Will Martin, principal
and John Martin, accessory, on the
charge of the murder of John K. Mc
Pherson near Wtfforloo last July, was
completed Wednesday morning when
the jury returned a verdict of not
guilty. It will be remembered that the
McPherson family and the Martins
fell out over an alleged improper re
mark to Miss Sue McPherson, a (augh
ter of the deceased, by John Martin, an
uncle of Will Martin. John McPher
son accosted Will Martin about the
matter in front of the Martin house
and a passage of words followed. John
Martin denied that he had used im
proper language to the little girl and
the lie followed. John McPherson drew
a knife and Will Martin interceded in
behalf of his uncle, drawing his pistol.
Will Martin claimed that he replaced
his pistol in his pocket and did not
pull it again until John McPherson
again advanced upon John Martin with
his open knife. He said that he shot
first at the ground to brighten McPher
son and then at his leg to cripple him.
After this the Martins left. They de
nied testimony to the effect that Will
Martin had made threats against John
McPherson. John McPherson died as
a result of the wounds several (lays
after the shooting.

Final Presentment of the Grand Jury,
To the Presiding Judge:
We have passed on all bills handed
us by the solicitor.
We have been informed by the
sup~ervisor that the recommendations
of last grand jury in reference to pub
lie road fromt Lanford Station to Bur
dette's will be considered by the coin
missioners and carriegl out as tar as
-practical, That it is impossible to
carry out former recommendations -in
freference to improvinag jail property on
account of failure of the general as
sembly to make the necessary, provi
sions therefor. We earnestly recomn
mend that provision be made by the
general assembly for the carryIng out
of these recommendations to the end
that a safe and sanitary jail buildlng
be provided for the county.

"Advices received from New York
today are to the effect that Senator
McLaurin was in a conference Satur
day night, which was also atended by
Insurance Commissioner McMaster,

they are working in harmony. Com

and love in which he is, and will ever

derstood to be an anti-administration
man. was re-elected in Ward 6. 1 [ci
