Home Economics School Great Success.
The extension school in home econom
ics closed Friday evening after four
successful days. The attendance, al
though good at first, kept increasing,
showing an increase of interest as the
school continued. Miss Bessie M.
Thayer gave all the lectures and
demonstrations except those on Wed
nesday and a part of Friday evening,
these were given by Mrs J. W. Dana.
The main thing Miss Thayer tried to
teach was the principle of food selec
tion, its effect upon health and vigor,
especially th3t of the growing child.
Under the topic, "Greater Variety in
Common Foods," simple ways of cook
ing and combining rice, peas and beans
with other foods to give greater variety
in our everyday diet were shown. A
more common use of milk and eggs
was recommended, especially for chil
dren. She spoke of nuts and cheese as
available sources of protein and ex
plained that they supplied the same
nutriment in the diet as meat and
should be used in place of it instead of
with it.
Mrs. Dana gave the lecture and
demonstrations Wednesday evening.
The main points in her talk were that
people, especially children, should avoid
eating too much meat and that the
more expensive meats contain less
nourishment than the inexpensive
ones. She demonstrated ways of cook
ing the cheaper cuts.. Miss Thayer
said in connection with her talk on
"Fruits and Vegetables.," that people
need an abundance of green vegeta
bles, fruits and water to offset the had
effects of meat. In speaking of fond
functions, she emphasized the necessity
of food supplying energy, building
tissue and regulating body processes.
The meeting in which the ways of
making housework easier were dis
cussed, was perhaps the most interest
ir,g to housekeepers, more took part in
this meeting than in any of the others
i ii i. j l i - ,
ana ine rneeung uevejopea into a
general discussion. The final lecture
was on the furnishing and sanitation in
the home.
Preliminary to the lectures on sew
ing, Miss Thayer demonstrated ways
of detecting adulteration in fabrics.
Her suggestions in regard to cutting
and making shirt waists and skirts
were practical and helpful. Not only
did all enjoy Miss Thayer's lectures,
but all felt the influence of her strong
personality. The average attendance
was about 75. Great credit is due the
local committee, Mrs. F. D. Thompson,
Mrs. F. D. Pierce and Miss Fanny
May, for securing the school and for
their careful attention to the
many
aeraiis necessary to make it a
success.

W. E. Hanson, who owns the Pills-bury-Baldwin
mills and yard here, is

day and a night shift for some time.

the stock in tbe yard and the growth
of the sawed lumber piles presage
more, business at this place than in any
season for several years. The late
snowfalls and cold weather bave helped

recent date, of the marriage of Miss

olis, Minn. The bride is well known
in Minnesota in the nursing profession
At the Methodist Church.
The subject for the morning was,
"The Unanswered Prayer." Text
found in Mark 5:19. A wonderful
change always follows Christ's pres
ence in a life or in a community.
There are many people today who are
asking Christ to depart from them
because his presence means an entire
change in their home life, in their
business. The Gospel must be lived,
writing of it or telling about it is
insufficient. Each new power, each
fresh experience carries with it new
responsibilities. The call to be a home
missionary, to serve Christ in the
home, is not less important than to be
a foreign missionary or a great evan
gelist. Character must sustain the
testimony or it were better to say
nothing. If there be love behind the
words they will not be lost.
The evening talk was upon "Abra
ham Lincoln, the Man Who Made Our
History." A program issued by the
Freedmen's Aid society was followed
in part. There is nothing new we can
say about this great man, yet like the
life of the Christ in whose steps he
followed, the story of his life never
loses its interest and gains luster year
after year. That God raised up Lincoln
for a special purpose, ftw men will dare
dispute In seeking for ihe secret of
Lincoln's greatness we are not com
pelled to go far It was a natural out
growth of his goodness The Bible did
mere than any oLher book to shape Lin
coln's life. He always carried one in
his pocket and studied as opportunity
offered. He always weighed things in
the balance of the Almighty. We
naturally think of Lincoln in conrvfc
tion wiih the emancipation of the
negro, for with a stroke of the pen he
pave liberty to the race which had
been in bondage for a century. If he
had lived he would have made wise
plans for the care of this race. He was
not permitted to do this and some one
else has had to do this.

B. A. NOTES
Here we
our school
body was
are again ! Did you miss
notes last week? Every
so busy on the days that
school reopened
our usual school
that we did not issue
column. A Conversa
tion which ran something like this
was overheard in the school library a
few days since, "Why, there aren't any
school notes in the Monitor, are
there?" "No, I looked for them but
couldn't find any. And what a differ
ence it makes in the paper.
'Oh, I
do miss the school notes, they're tbe
best part of the p3per." (With apolo
gies to the editor.) And perhaps you
missed the school notes in last week's
paper, too. Mr. Reader, did you?
School work has been progressing in
a business-like fashion since the re
opening of school on Tuesday morning,
March 14, for the spring term of 12
weeks. It is taken for granted that
the pupils enjoyed the recent vacation
of two weeks, but after that vacation
everybody was glad to begin school
work again this last week.
The seniors held a meeting last week
and chose their class colors, garnet
and white. "Better late than never."
The magazine and newspaper de
partment of the school library has
recently been increased by the sub
scription to several more magazines
and the following periodicals and
newspapers are now on file : Literary
Digest, Scribner's, Outlook, System,
Orleans County Monitor, Christian
Science Monitor, Vermont Advance,
and the University of Vermont Cynic.

when he came to West Burke to reside.
He married Mary Ellen Silsby of West
Burke Jan. 1, 1871, and to them four
children were born. One son died in
early childhood, and another, Frank,
left the home circle when about 18
years old. The daughter, Celia, is a
higbschool' teacher in Waltham.Mass.,
and the son, Ray, has a good business
position in Boston. Mr. Spencer was
a member of Company K, 8th Vt.
regiment, and will be greatly missed by
the few remaining comrades. He was
a member of the M. E. church, where
he has been a faithful worker for many
years. He was a good neighbor, a
kind and loving husband and father,
and a true fiiend, and his going leaves
a vacancy that will be hard to fill. He
has been ill since September, being
confined to his bed much of the time.
The end came Thursday morning and
the funeral occurred Saturday after
noon at his late home. Rev. J. Q.
Angell officiated and selections were
sung by a male quartet from St.
Johnsbury. Many beautiful flowers
told of the love and esteem felt for
him by a large circle of friends and
aqcuaintances. "Taps" were sounded,
at tbe cemetery, just as he was laid to
rest, mustered out from the ranks of
this Grand Army to join that grander
army above. Aside from his immedi
ate family, Mr. Spencer leaves one
brother, Hiram Spencer, now of West
Burke, and several other relatives.
Mrs. Spencer, and the other members
of the stricken family have the heart
felt sympathy of the whole community
in their loneliness and grief. Those
from "out of town who attended the
funeral were Mrs. Ada Silsby, Mrs.
Louise Silsby, Mrs. Annie French,
Mrs. Lougee and Mrs. Flora Washburn
of St. Johnsbury, and Bert Davis of
Newport.
WHEN I SAW SWEET NELLIE
HOME.
In the sky the bright stars glit
tered. On the grass the moonlight
fell;
Hushed the sound of daylight's
bustle.
Closed the "pink eyed pimper
nell," As down the mossgrown wood
path,
Where the cattle love to roam.
From Aunt Patty's quilting
party
I was seeing Nellie home.
When the autumn tinged the
greenwood.
Turning all its leaves to gold;
In tbe lane by alders shaded,
I my love to Nellie told;
As we stood together gazing
On the star bespangled dome,
How I blessed the August even
ing When I saw. sweet Nellie,
home.
White hairs mingle with her
tresses,
Furrows steal upon my brow.
But a love smile cheers and
blesses
Life's declining moments now;
Matron in thy snowy 'kerchief
Closer to my bosom come;
Tell. me, dost thou still remem
ber When 1 saw sweet Nellie
home?
