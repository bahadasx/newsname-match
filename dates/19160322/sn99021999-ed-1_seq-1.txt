was reached at a conference today
between President Wilson and 8en
atora Walsh, Kern, Martin. Swan
son, James, Myers and Stone. H wag
agreed that water power legislation
should be passed by this congress
but that It should not Interfere with
progress of the army bill.
The form ot the water power bill wiih
discussed exhaustively at the conference.
Opposition has been expressed to some
features of the Myers bill, now pending
In the senate, providing for the leasing
of water power sites on public lands.
Some senators thought the bill glvea too
much authority to the federal govern
ment. '
The president has expressed deep In
terest In the water bill.
Army ' P Hens.
The house today continued work on
the Hay army reorganisation bill with
about two-thirds of the measure remain
ing to be disposed of. Among the Sec
tions awaiting conshleretlon were those
relating to the National guard, the Indus
trial reserve, and providing for a nitrate
plant. s
The first action of the house today
was to adopt without debate an ameul
ment to give the president absolute con
trol over the reserve ot w.ow men.
The. bill, erlglnslly provided that author
ity must he granted bycotigress before
"the" reservists" Could he moWHafel. "An
amendment offered by Representative
Kahn of the committee end accepted by
Chairman May, puts reservists under the
orders of the secrets ry of war to be sent
to any point when the call to the colors
goes out. t
The amendment Is the most Important
addition to the bill yet made. As the
measure now stands the president would
have authority without consulting con
gress, to Increase the army from 140,000
fighting troops to 175,000 and also to sum
mon to the colors the 00,000 reservists
which the hill contemplates will be pro
vided within four years.
Aathoay Amendment ftejeeted
The house rejected a proposal by Rep
resentative Anthony, republican, of Kan
sag, to reorult an additional Infantry
regtment In Porto Rico for service In the
Panama Canal sons or elsewhere.
Mr. Kahn then proposed as an amend
ment a provision In the senate bill that
while the enlistment period should re
main fixed at three years with the colors
and four years in reserve, commanding
officers might discharge peculiarly effi
cient men Into the reserve after one year
of training and that any well trained
man could go Into the reserve on his own
application at the end of twe years' ac
tive service.
The amendment was defeated, lis to 10S.
The question will come up again in the
conference oommlttee. as the senate bill
is almost certain to retain its provision.
First Defeat lor Hay.
Encoursged by the narrow margin
which defeated the Kahn amendment.
Representative Gardner re-offered the
first proposition of that amendment In
new language. It was carried. 131 to 11T,
being the first defeat for Chairman Hay
during the consideration of the bill.
The amendment as agreed to provides
soldiers may bo discharged Into the
reserve at the end of one year's service
with the colors on approval of their
commanding officers.
Chairman Hay argued that the effect
of the provision was to reduce the term
of enlistment with tho colors to such a
degree that the efficiency of the army
as a whole would be Impaired. Repre
sentative Gardner contended that It
would encourage eullstment and tend to
build up quickly a well trained reserve,
since no man discharged Into the reserve
under the provision could re-enlist In the
army until he had completed six years'
service in the reserve.
