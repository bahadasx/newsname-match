DIGGER OF GRAVES GERMAN OFFENSIVE "IE SQUAD" MEN
TELLS OF STRUGGLE AT VERDUN ENDS IN ARE READYTOSTAND
ON SMALL WAGE FAILURE, PARIS SAYS TRIAL ON SATURDAY
Arlington Cemotery Employe
Before House Committee
Hearing on Nolan Bill.
UVES ON $40 A MONTH
Lilts Expenses at Request of
Committee Wife Takes in
Sewing to Help.
Trom Arlington Cemetery where
eosUy monument tower above the rest
to places of a nation' heroes, where
patrtotlo speeches occasionally Inspire
crest multitudes to cheers, and where
ths pomp and corcmony of military
burials are staged there came today,
before a House committee, an humble
gravedigger with a story of how he
tries to support a family on J40 a month.
This gravedlgger, paid from the Treas
ury of the United Mates, had, 'clinging
to a worn-out suit and rundown shoes,
the clay from nowmado graves. It was
raining without but graves must be
dug whatever the weather 'may be,
Daring his faltering story he told the
ilouse Committee that there were five
graves to be dug at Arlington today
by men who get f 40 a month.
Crushed and Discouraged.
The grave digger was a big man phy
Ivally. Ills mud bespattered form was
the conspicuous thing In a committee
room filled with the' advocates of the
Nolan bill whch requires that the rich
United' States Government shall pay no
employe less man w per day.
Despite the physical strength of this
fravedlgger, however, he was at heart
crushed and discouraged Ills story was
Interrupted by a choking feeling In the
throat: his lips quivered and the tears
came to his eyes.
Congressman Nolant at this juncture,
aided tho witness to regain his com
posure by talking to him of the com
parative cost of housekeeping now and a
Jew years ago.
The scene reminded some of Shake
speare's "Hamlet," but even In this
melancholy pta the gravedlggcr was a
man of Jest and an easy-going philoso
pher. The gTavedlggcr who told nil
unusual, siory toaay to ine iiouso sud-
1 it J4 JWUW-'fflmire.'"; H6' told of life's
struggle on a salary of 140 a month.
Story of Struggle,
Out of. this 140 a month, he testified,
there must be paid W per month for
what Is called a house near Kails
Church. An additional J5 per month
goes for car fare for the Journeys to
and from his home. Out of tho re
mainder must be furnished food, cloth
ing, and medicine for a family of rour.
"The cheapest thing we can get to
cat," said the gravedlgger when Mr.
Ptclon questioned him. "is navy beans
and hominy. That Is what we art
bringing up the children on. I remem
ber when beans were 8 cents a quart;
now thoy aro 20 cents per quart."
"Get your wife to make out a state
ment of what It coct to keep house
whrn you were first mnrrled." said Mr.
Nolan. "Then havo her mark down tho
price of some of tho thing sou huv
ana some of the things you need now."
Near Breakdown.
It was this request from Mr. Nolan
that enabled the cemetery laborer to
continue his story when ho was ubaut
to break down.
"Do you have a garden?" ho was
asked.
"I have one," ho replied, ' tut I have
little time left for gardening. I fro to
work at a quaiter tc 7 nnd get home
after S o'clock. A fellow hasn't much,

SHORT RATIONS.
Anxiety over the fato of the two

The fact that two aviators ahd their

Captain Foulols, to whom the missing
men were to havi- tor.orted early Mon

him of the failure of the two licuttn
ants to report and asking that an in

Immediate Steps Taken.
Realising that tho two lieutenants
were doomed to starvation in the burn
ing desert, if thny had not already
perished by accidents. Major Sample
took lmmcdlnto steps looking tn thetr
rescue.
A number of motor trucks vere dis
patched Into MoxIcl with ordors to run
at top speed to participate in the ienrch
for the missing men Hcoren of cavalry
scouts also were dispatched to partici
pate In tho search
Captain Fnu!ols. after communicating
with Major Sample, sent un three avla
tori from the advance base In the field
with Instruction to remain aloft as
long as daylight lasted and make every
effort to locate the missing acropicnes
and lieutenants. The scouttner aviators
returned to the base last night without
having found anv trace ot LleuUnnnts
Wills and Gorrell or their machines.
Lost in Bad Country.
The country In which the two missing
men are bolieved to have disappeared
Is one of the worst localities in a!l of
Mexico.
The route followed bv the other six
aeroplanes which left here with Lieu
tenants Willis and Gorrell waa over 110
miles of desert and mountains throuah
the Casas Oiandes valley, from which
point the expeditionary forces are ope
rating. Tho aero ecouts. motor truck drivers
and members of the Infantry and ca
cli' squadrons searching for the tntss
Inx men are carrying rations and water
with which to relieve tho Buffering of
the lieutenants should thev be found.
Neither of the men was accompanied
by a mechanician. This was cause for
further suspense, for even though tbo
rren merely descended to repair their
machines or correct defects, the fact
that they were alone may have pre
cluded their being able to copo with
the situation wmen conironiea mem
and compelled them to remain helpless
in the desert or mountains.
