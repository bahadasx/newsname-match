Police Arrest William Kaholakai
' Who Says Drink Was Cause
of Escapade
Confessing to all the detaUs of his
escapade on Saturday night, when,
with another man, -he stole a hacK
from a Japanese on Vineyard and
River streets and rode over town de
fying citizens and members of th
police force until finally driven into
the bushes near Kapiolani Park bv
Officers Barry and Sizemore, Wil
liam Kaholokai, Hawaiian-Chinese,
was taken into custody today by, de
tectives. " Today's arrest and confession is the
result of persistent work by the de
tective department and with the ar
rest Acting Chief Kellett's promise of
two days ago Is made good.
John Andrews, Portuguese, was
taken into j custody yesterday, and
though he refuses yet to admit the
theft, Kaholokai's testimony is
against him.
Both Andrews and Kaholokai bave
served terms in Oahu prison. An
drews was sent up for robbing an old
Portuguese man in 1910 and was out
on parole. Kaholokai was convicted
in Maul of first degree robbery In
1914 fcnd was paroled on July 23, 1914.
His terra expired last January.
Drink Given Blame.
Drink, according to Kaholokai,
caused their escapade on Saturday
night They had been drinking to
gether in the early part of the even
ing and after paying a visit to Camp
2 started .back to town.
Finding a hack standing on the cor
ner alone, the two jumped into it
and began ' their ride, which ; finally
led them out Beretania street to Kai
muki From ther? they went toward
Waikiki, planning to steal chickens
from one Yong Yin. The Chinese
fired at them, however, and thev
turned back, going around Diamond
Head by Fort Ruger.
Near the publieSoaths they planned
to leave the hack, when they saw
the officers approaching on motor
cycles. At the call of halt they
jumped out axed ran for the brush .
Neither, of them was wounded by the
officers' bullets and neither fired,
though Kaholokai says he had a re
volver, which he threw away when
ihe chase began. They will appear
in the police icourt tomorrow.
