Methodist Ladies Satisfy
inner Man"
Tlie second monthly meeting of the
Chickasha Men's Dinner club, with the
accompanying eats, several gallons of
ice water, a few smokes and the cua
toiurry number of good, bad, tolerably
Lad and very .bud speeches, occurred
yesterduy evening, together with some
tiky-piercins flights of oratorical avia
tors. Tlie dinner was served by the ladies
of the Good Samaritan society of the
Methodist church and was a nior t ex
cellent one, heartily enjoyed by all
present and fn every way worthy of
the appreciation of all who delighted
Jr. delectable things !u the gastrono
mic line.
Covers had been laid for S6, that
r.umber of the club's membership hav
ing expressed their intention of at-t'-nding
the "feed." However, owing
tc stress of 'business and non-acquaint-ai
re with the rules laid down by
Georgie Washington on the famous
evening when he sacrificed the win
ter's sui ply of canned cherries in the
interests of the family woodpile and
the. cause of the anti-Ananias society,
some thlry-9 of numW failed
ti report when the tune of "Eighty
Cents Per" wk played by tlie orches
tra. Following altercation between
F resident D 11. Roche of the cluo
and the toaslmaster as to who was to
act as official mailer of ceremonies
and as to whether the toasts should
proc"ed or follow in the wakt of the
dinner, a compromise was rearhed
whereby, at! tl.e suggestion of Dr.
Thrailklll, the president delivered hi?
inaugural address.
Between courser, tlie guests of the
c lining were entertained by argu
ments between, the toa:;t mutter and
the majority of the guests as to wheth.
cr J. W. Speake at.d Oscar Simpson
should torture those present with a
song apiec. The majority rule being
applied, the toaj-lmaster won, white

After the dishes ot each succeeding
cikrse had been depleted to the sur
feiting of thcfce present, the real bus
iness cf the evening happened and
ijinny and nutneious were those who
unburdened their chests of pent up
oratory and sweat and swelled and
roared in an effort to-make one pair
ol maculino lungs dron' the noiso
made by a couple dozens of sufl'ra
feites, all working in harmony and
unison in the rear of the building.
With rare forethought some one
had provided a rule whereby none
should be perm'tted to devote over

This rule worked a hardship on manj

The rule also prevented, through
Us hanU application, P. I). Shaffer
from finishing his explanation of
'Why Gas Meters are Ever Busy,"
and wrought everlasting wreck and
liiin and instruction, to. a number of
other orators of the evening, includ
ing J. E. Sehow. who was billed to
expound "Neutrality."
However, there wero a nnmhrr ofj
good speeches made. Notable anioi.i
those was the speech of Rev. I-aw
fence L. Ci.hen, Ir . the new Methodist
minister, who, even though ha wan
dered far from the field of thought
which the tonstmaslcr had ordered
him to fo'.I&w in his discourse, man
aged to reach his final period without
too greatly mystifying ills auditors.
Tossibly the best .ipeech of the even
ins was that of Mayor Coffman, who
stated he was proud of the fact that
ho lived In Chickasha and that he did
not care to pay any more. The mayor
stopped well within his minute and a
bnlf limit.
Jonas Cook made inother good
t-peech, hut when he wandered from
the paths of fact and entered the
realms of fiction by stating that he
expected; to live in Chickasha for a
hundred years to come, he was
promptly sat upon and time was ctill
ed.
And then every one went home, fol
lowing adjournment in due and ancient
form, there to remain and nurse their
appetitles until the next regular
monthly dinner.
In the course of his Inaugural ad
dress President Roeha reviewed the
crinciules uDon which the club Is
founded, stating that tho organiza-
tion had no rules or regulations, be
ing designed chief!'' to promote good
fllovshlp and provide good times for
the men of the city, and that the doors
were always wide open to weleouu
new mera'iers, who needed no Invita
tion to enter therein.

said J. T. Hill as he handed to the
newspaper man for publication his
announcement for the Democratic

me and what kind of man I am," said
Mr. Hill. "All that I promise them
is that if they elect me as their county
clerk, I will do my best; to see that
the office Is honestly and economi
cally conducted and you may also
tiate that I will never again be a can
didate for public of.'ice."
