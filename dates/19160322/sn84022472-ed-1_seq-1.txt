STEEL CO. READY
TO CHOP PRICES
ON ARMOR PLATE
Fear of Government Plant
Causes Company to Offer
a Reduction.
PROFFER A CUT
OF$30ONATQN
President Grace Says Fed
eral Factory Would Close
Steel Plant.
Washington, March. 22 When the
House naval committee today receiv
ed the Tillman bill for a' government
armor plate plant, which passed the
Senate yesterday, it also received a
proposal from the Bethlehem Steel
Co. to cut the price of armor from
the present pric4 of $425 a ton to
$395.
This offer previously was made 'to
the Senate committee' and ignored. In
the face of threats i after the Seriate
committee's, refusal' to entertain the
proposal that the armor makers
would raise the price if the bill pass
ed, the company's renewed ofreK caus
ed much surprise.
The proposal was submitted by
President Grace, of. the Bethlehem Co
who' repeated his statement that if
the government erected a plant private
w.orks worth more than $20,000,000
would be made useless. President
Grace's proposal , continued:
"The Bethlehem Steel Co., altogetn
er aside from its financial interests,
recognized its obligation as a citizen
and, in order that its position may be
clearly' understood, now desires for
mally toNsu-bmit tits following proposi
tion to the federal government:
"We will manufacture one-third or
such additional quantity as may be
awarded to us, of the armor plate
required for the. contemplated five
year naval program, estimated at ap
proximately 120,000 tons, at a price
of $395 per ton as compared wltn
the price of $425 now obtaining.
"The proposed price is lower than
has been paid by the government for
more than ten years. ;
'If the foregoing price is not satis-
factory' we will agree to permit any
well known firm of chartered account
ants or the feleral trade commission.
to inventory our plant and make care
ful estimates of the cost of manufac
ture, wlth that data in hand we will
meet tne secretary oi uw aavj.iiuu
guarantee-to-iwanufacture armor at a
price which will be entirely satisfae
toi-yVta him ai being quite as low as
the lowest price at which the govern
ment could, possibly tnannfrVure ar
mor on its own account, after taking
into aoount all proper charges.
; "We make the foregoing proposition
rather than have our plant put out of
existence. We have invested, as ac
tually inventoried today ,Over $7,000,009
in that plant. This figure does not
take into account the large expendi
tures, certainly $2,000 wv0.: for the plants
and equipment which have been aban
doned on account of becoming obso
lete. ' .. x '
"We i are today selling armor ta the
United States government at a lower
price than England, Germany, France
Austria and - Japan are paying, even
where the- government itself (Japan)
has embarked in' the business. Not
only' is that, true, but . the specifications
of the United States are much more
rigid and the wages paid are very
much higher than those prevailing in
any foreign country.
"Steel prices are continually going
up and they are today much higher
than has been the case for many
years. In spite of that we offer to
make armor at a lower' price than the
United States has paid for 29 years
and we agree to accept this price for
the next five years. We also call at
tention to the fact that though since
the war ' began we have been able to
Europe to get almost , any price we
chose jto ask for ordnance, he have
during the period made no addition
whatever to the selling price to the
United . States government for any of
the . ordnance products which we man

County Commissioners Re

'Officers and members of the Young
Emmet club- testified before the
county commissioners this morning at
a hearing on the remonstrance against
the club's application for a liquor li
cense. Treasurer James Lynch de
clared the organization was a bona
fide one. He said the club had been
in existence for many years and that
only members in good standing were
allowed to enter on Sunday. He pro
duced bank books showing the ' club
had $452 in the treasury. All money
received from the sale of liquor is
deposited in the club treasury and no
individual profits, from the sale, de
clared the treasurer.
Former President Patrick Coleman
of the club produced some of the club
record books but said he could not
find the minute book which contained
records of recent meetings. He said
this volume had been taken by the
police or had been mislaid by one of
the officers.
Dog and Liquor Agent John Brown;
Jr., told . of raiding the club last
month upon complaint of people who
had been annoyed by intoxicated men
coming from the lobby of the build
ing at Main and Congress streets. The
witnees said the Loyal Order, of
Moose had quarters in the same build
ing and dispensed liquor on Sunday.
He didn't know how it was discovered
whether the intoxicated men came
from the Young Emmet club or the
Moose.
The witness declared that when the
raiding party entered they found
about 25 men there drinking. The
club furniture consisted of about 24
chairs, three tables, a bar and a cash
register. -At the time of the raid two
men were playing cards and the rest
were drinking.
The commissioners reserved decis
