Quite a number of Democrat

Anyway, there wasn't any

The unearned increment of
wealth is not doing it share of
bearing the burden ef public ex

form should strike first. Men
who are exploiting the natural
resources of wealth and laying
up fortunes whose immensity be
comes appalling, should be com
pelled to disgorge for the beaeSt
of the public. The natural re
courses of wealth are of no man's
making and therefore nil society
shoald have a share in its enjoyment.
