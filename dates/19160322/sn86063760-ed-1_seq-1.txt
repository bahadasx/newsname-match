REACHES VILLA TERRITORi
Details of Pursuit Are Withheld Bu
All Reports Indicate That Bandit
Is Not Very Far Ahead.
San Antonio, Texas.-General Persh
ing led the greatest part of his fore
beyond Cases Grandes and personall
began the direction of operations :tha
it is hoped at headquarters would ter
minate in the capture of Francisc<
Villa, according to army headquarter
here . All. the evidence secured 4ndi
cated that Villa' was niot 'ixadiymif.e
away but whether he intended to con
tinue his flight or stop and. fight- stil
remained unknown to the Americpns
General Funston withheld all infor
mation as to the details for the activ
pursuit of Villa.
Two troops of the Twelfth Cavalr
arrived at Columbus and have. bee
sent forward to patrol this line aldnl
which detachments of infantry' alsi
have been stationed. From Columba:
to Cases Grandes supplies will bi
moved by automobile trucks and wag
ons, and, if permission 'is secured
that means of transportatiqn will be
supplemented by shipments over. -thk
Mexican Northwestern Railway. fros
El Paso. -
The negotiations looking -to .the
uses of the railroad as far south a,
Casas Grandes had. not been tremi
nated, according to General Funster
who pointed out what great assistaneo
t permission to make shipments b
.nil would be.
General Pershing's wireless -equim
ment was operated to better advant
age. Trouble in communicating b!
that means had been experienced -bu
messages are now arriving at gener
headquarters with less delay and great
er frequency.
None of General Funston's infor
.mation indicated the -exact where
abouts of Villa but there was a die
position at his headquarters to regarc
as perhaps -true the reports comin
from official Mexican sources that -h4
had- reached Babicora in the distrie
of Guerrero, near his boyhood home

Washington.-Natlonal def ,nse I
islation overshadowed every other 1E

sharply from a whole day of deba

McLaurin Offers :.. Protection.
State warehouse commissioner John
L. McLaurin has given out a state
ment in which he said that "in antici
pation of the action of the Southeast
em Underwriters' Association in get
ting companies to withdraw- from
South Carolina, and especially the
threats as to insurance upon property
upon which loans are outstanding in
the attempt to force the calling -of.the
loans," he went to New York. and had.
made arrangements tahere which were,
ample to take care of all such insur
ance. He stated that he believes
the number of the withdrawals. by
companies from this state has been
exaggerated and that after this ex
citement is over it will be found that
there are plenty of companies in
c South Carolina to do the business.
- "But if any one desires to place in
surance, which is necessary on ac
count of the present situation as thaj
. result of cancellations or refusals to
renew; if they will write to. me I will
place the Insurance in New York
through the channels which I have
ari-anged," he said.
"The policies," said Mr. McLaurin,
"will be written in companies whose
1 standing is acceptable to the life In
surance or mortgage companies mak
ing loans in South Carolina. I wish
r to reiterate emphatically that if any
one is threatened with the calling of
loans or in any other manner to the
detriment of the business interests. of
South Carolina by the cancellation..or
failure to renew fire insurance poll
cies, I can place this insurance in
some of the best companies *in the
United States, and this talk about
calling loans is mere moonshine.'
"I have been flooded with -letters
from insurance agents requesting that
I furnish them the names of -the com
panies in order that- they may -form.
connections with them. I desire to
say that I have not felt called- upon
to seek insurance connections for
agents of companies which are with
drawing or may withdraw, but :at
I am simply seeking to protect 'the
business interests, of: the people of
South Carolina from threatened dis
arrangement by the Sogtheastern Un
derwriters' Association and have per
fected arrangements to this end.".

GET BEST PRICE FOR BUTTER
Important to Have Flavor Pleasing-to
Senses of Smell and Tate-Put
in Neat Package.
In order to secure the best price for
butter it must have a flavor which s
so pleasant to the sense of smell and
so sweet to the taste that it will cre=
ate a desire for more. The texture,
grain and closeness should be waxy.
and firm, and not salvy, greasy or
crumbly. It should be close in body,
not spongy, and contain not-too much,
nor too little, moisture.
The color should be uniforui and.ac
cording to the requirements -of the
market. Salting according to- the de-,
mand of the market for which. the but-.
ter is intended is an. importait: fea
ture. Too much salt destroys --the
sweet taste, and too little salt::makes f
the butter insipid and tasteless.
The package in which the butter is.
marketed demands careful considera
tion. The appearance of the package
when the .butter goes to marset.is-one
of the things that helps to All, that
butter. The package ought to ibe-eat,
clean and attractive- The ono-pouind
brick print is the style most used- and
is superior'to the plan of. putting the
butter up' in rolls or otherwise; for
it can be handfed at less cost -and with
less waste. .- -
The~ butter, of course, should. be -
wrapped in parchment or butter 'pa
per, which should be of-good quality,
of proper size and dipped in-'cold wa=.
ter before being used. It pays well to
have some special brand printed on
the wrapper in fancy letters -withthe -
name of the maker or the name of the
farm. The prints ought to-weigh not
less than 16% ounces each, the, extra
weight being for shrinkage before
reaching the consumer. TheAtine of r
marketing deponds on local conditions, 1
