COURT ORDER
AGAINST STAR
IS WIPED OUT
The order secured by Attorney John F. Murphy Tuesdav
from Judge Ronald, directed against publication in The Mar
the so-called Oayburg article*, was promptly knocked out
Wednesday morning on motion of Attorney John 11 Perry
for The Star.
I he court dissolved the order on the ground* advanced
by Attorney Perry: First, that no bond was put up, and
secondly, because the order is illegal, unlawful and in con
travention to the constitution of the state of Washington.
1 he ca*e was not to come up for hearing until Friday,
hut the order issued was so unusual and, in the opinion of
The Star, so clearly unconstitutional, that this paper lost no
time in moving to have the order withdrawn.

SENATOR ASKS
CALL TO ARMS
IN VILLA HUNT
WASHINGTON, March 22.—Sen. Sherman introduced
a resolution today asking President Wilson to call 50.0C0
volunteers for service in Mexico.
He asked that it be passed immediately.
Sherman declared development* indicated the army was
not prepared to pursue Villa. His resolution stipulated that
the volunteers lie used only fur punitive purposes, and not
for intervention, and that they would have to be mustered
out when Villa was captured or killed.
The Hay army increase bill, it is expected, will be passed
by the house today, several amendments having been adopted
yesterday, *
At the same time, the -enate passed Sen. Tillman's bill,
providing for government owned armor plate factory to cost
not more than $1 I.OfJO.fXX).
The bill passed l»y a vote of 5S to 2.V
In addition to the democratic support, nine republican*
voted for the measure, as follows: Borah, Clapp, Cummins,
Gronna, Kenyon, Xorris, Poindexter, Sterling and Works.
Probably the most important amendment adopted to the
Hay bill was the proposal of Hep. (iard of Ohio for the re
serve officers' training scheme.
It provides military instruction by the war depart
ment in educational institutions with an available student
body o( 100 or more
After first defeating an amendment by Hep. Kahn, the
house later reversed itself and adopted a similar amendment
by Rep. < »ardner to permit efficient regular soldiers to be dis
charged into the reserve in one year on recommendation of
their commanders or in two years on their own motion.

SWISS COMMANDER
DISCUSSES U. S. ARMY
BERXF., Switzerland. March 22— To handle the Mexican
problem, the I. nited States need- border commanders with
the power to act on their own initiative in crises such as
the Villa raid, Col. Sprecher Von Bernegg, chief of the Sw'.ss
general -taff, told the United Press today..
To meet other more serious international crises that
may arise at any hour, the United States needs a stronger
navy than Japan, a large standing army to guard her coasts
and borders, and military training for her youths, he added.
The Swiss military leader is one of the mpst expert mili
tary men in all Europe.
lie shows evidence of having made the closest study of
American military problems.
An earnest advocate of the "Swiss System" for his own
republic, he believes the system should be modified if intro
duced in the United States.
"Switzerland Is small," Col.
Sprecher said. "Our troops move
quickly. You would be obliged to
modify the system to suit your size.
For example, you need commanders
along Ihe border writh power to act
on their own Initiative In such a
situation as the Villa Incident.
"The Swiss system, If Introduced
In America, needs a hundred
changes, but the first thing is to
get military training started. Other
questions can be settled as you go
along.
"In America you will always need
a large standing army to guard
your coasts and borders. To this
you must udd a stronger navy than
Japan's to keep you safe.
"You ought to have Immense mili
tary supplies along your coasts and
borders, but not close enough to
allow enemy landing forces to cap
ture them.
"A large force ought to guard
the Panama canal and you ought
to be able to augment your troops

I was glad, the other day, therefore, when 1 read a geological
survey bulletin, telling of the oil-bearing shales of Colorado, Utah
and Wyoming
I)o you know what shale Is? It Is that sort of rotten stone which
splits ap and which Is culled in many parts of the country "slate."
Slate, however. Is only one kind of shale
Much of It Is brown, yellow or slate-color, and the latter In soma
canes comes pretty near being coal.
There are billions of ton* of shale In these Weitern states, which
It literally soaked with oil and gas.
There is enough of it in Colorado alone to furnish 20,000,000,000
barrels of crude oil, which by ordinary methors will yield 2,000,000,000
barrels of gasoline, and by the Rittmann method will yield not lea*
than 10,000.000,000 barrels.
And the shale Isn't owned by Standard Oil —yet.
WHY DOESN'T SOME ONE DEVELOP THIS NEW MINE OF
OIL, AND DO IT QUICKLY?
There are gas engines In use amounting to 60,000.000 horse
power in the I'nlted States
This Is perhaps twice the power of all sleam engines.
Next to the breakdown of the farming Interests, the depression
of the gas engine business will be felt keenest
Let us hope that they will find ways by which the scarcity may
be cured.
And, Incidentally, that Ritttnannprocess Is said to obtain from
crude oil two or three times the amount of gasoline obtainable by
ordinary method*.
