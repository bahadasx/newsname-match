On Line of .March of American Army,
Mexico, March 22, via Courier to Co
lumbus, N. M„ March 22.—The trail
along which Fancho Villa retreated
from Columbus less than two weeks
ago is today a broad, well worn high
way, visible at some points for miles
as It winda over and around the hilla
In northern Chihuahua. The road ia
an evidence of the efficiencyt. of the
American army, which has in a week's
time converted the traik Into a military
road, the main artery for. supplies to
General, Pershing'^ punitive column.
Tills new road Is not an ideal high
way but it serves the purpose. The
big gray auto trucks which carry sup
plies by the ton have cut ruts so deep
in the bottomless sand and gravel that
at some places there is no longer clear
ance for the axles and parallel roads
have beep laid out alongside the old
trails.
8upply Traina Dot Trail.
At intervals of a tew miles each can
be seen what appears to be huge clouds
of gray smoke. Those mark the po
sitions of moving supply trains, cavalry
patrols, squads of signal corps men ori
military automobiles.
On the Individual Initiative and skill
of the American soldier and his officer
depends the suseeps of moving supplies
over these Mexican roads.
Motorcycle .dispatch riders aid their
machines by. vigorous use of their legs.
As the motorcycles plunge into the ruts,
or dip Into sand piles, their riders stick
out a leg on each side as a prop,' choke
the engine, and as the machine topples
inevitably to one side or the other,
they give a, kick with whichever foot
comes most handy to straighten up the
machine and then go roaring ahead

TRANSFER GERMAN CRUI8ER.
Cormorant and Crew Interned at
Guam, to Cems to United States.
Washington,, March 22.——'The United
States cruiser Brooklyn, which sailed
from Manila last Thursday, is due to
arrive at Guam today, from which
port, lt Is understood, she will convey
to San Francisco the German, .cruiser
Cormorant, which sought refuge there
whwi she was pursued by a JannnpsA
warship some month's ago. The Brook
lyn left Manila under sealed orders aind
her destination had been the subject
of more or lesa conjecture,
During her flight the Cormorant's
crew tore up the wooden deck floors
for fuel and the exposed Iron radiated
so much heat that several of them
developed symptoms of insanity.
After
i-
the Cormorant interned at
Guam it became apparent that the
tropical heat and the necessary restric
tions -made living conditions unbear
able to the crew, As a result it was
decided to bring the vessel and her
crew to the United States.
