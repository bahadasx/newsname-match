TRAILING VILLA
Assisted By a Bunch Of
Carranza Men.
VILLA IS DOUBLING (ROUND
-But Uncle Sam's Men Seem To
Have Him Quite Certainly
Located.
CLASH NOW SEEMS IMMINENT
El Paso, Tex., March 20. Villa
lias doubled cast and south to Nam
lquipa, according to a telegram re
ceived by Gen. Gavlra at Juarez to
day. Ho reports that Carranza
" troops are advancing from the south,
while the Americans are continuing
their march from the north In an ef
fort to close the net around the ban-
dlt.
Gen. Gavlra said he knew nothing
of the American troops except that
they are hard on the chase. Nor
has he any details of the Carranzls
ta troops co-operating In the move
ment. Col. Cano was the closest to
Villa's fleeing rear guard at El Valle.
After leaving El Valle, where he
had abandoned thirty of his wound
ed, Villa turned directly west to San
Miguel Babrlcora, said Gavlra, who
explained that he had learned that
the Babrlcora where Villa was re
ported yesterday was San Miguel
Babrlcora and not the Babrlcora
near the lake of that name, some
miles further to the south of Mrs.
Phoebe Hearst3 ranch. San Miguel
Babrlcora Is about twenty miles west
of El Valle. Prom that point Villa
made a sudden twist and struck to--ward
Namlquipa. forty miles south.
A clash botween the Villista and
Carranzisfa forces is imminent, ac
cording to advices received to-day
through Gen. Vavlra. Villa, fleeing
south before the rapidly advancing
American troops, is apparently try
ing to break through the Mexican
American cordon closing in on him.
He is seeking a doopholo in the di
rection of Namlquipa through which
he can escape into the mountains
1 around Guerrero and Santa Ana, the
f familiar ground where ho began ills
'bandit career.
The Carranzlstas are advancing
north from Namlquipa forty miles
tIrom San Miguel Babrlcora, twenty
mlles west of El Valle, where Villa
was reported yesterday. As the
bandit is traveling south, a few
hours should decide whether he can
ovade the troops of Gen. Carranza
or bo forced into either fighting
them or doubling on his tracks.
Cnrranza After Raiders.
Mexico City, March 20. Tho Mln.
Ister of War, Gen. Obregon, has is
sued a decree declaring all partici
pants In tho Columbus raid outside
the law. Tho decree gives the right
to any citizen to apprehend and kill,
It necessary, the followers of Villa
who crossed tho American frontier.
The first victim of this decree was
summarily executed to-day In tho
city of Hermoslllo, near which placo
he was captured by men who de
nounced him as one of tho raiding
party. Tho execution was carried
out on direct orders of tho Minister
of War, who personally sent instruc
tions to Gen. P. Ellas Calles, Mili
tary Governor of Sonora, to that of
fect. Another suspect, Carlos Reza, a
former reactionary leader, was ta
ken into custody but was not execut
ed, owing to lack of ovidenco. Ho
will be taken to Satlllo, where ho
will bo tried by court-martial.
Tho authorities declare that tho
efforts to run down tho bandits will
Increase with time, and that the
Government will not rest until all
tlioso guilty of crime against tho
United States have been run to
earth. Gen. Pesquelra, Assistant
Mlnlster.of War, has been In confer
ence with his chief on the subject.
M Villa Still At LnrKC.
San Antonio, Tex., March 20.
Francisco Villa may be forced into
the fight with American troops with
fitiho next thlrty-slx hours, if re
ports coming to Gen, Fttnston's
headquarters, both from Gen. Per
shing and from Mexican sources, are
correct.
Gen. Pershing reported
to-day j
that Villa had been reported defeat
ed by Mexican Government troops
near Cruces, and that he was march
ing northward In retreat. Gen, Per
shing's report, howover, was follow
ed by tho unofficial report thnt Villa
was still lighting at Namlquipa,
south of Cruces.
Cnrrnnza's Poor Support.
El Paso, Tex., March 20. Tho
forces of Col. Cano were engaged In
battlo at 4:30 o'clock this afternoon
With bandits led by Villa In Naml
quipa, according to a dispatch re
ceived this afternoon by Gen. Gavlra,
Carranza commandnnt at Juarez.
Namlquipa Is In the district of Guer
rero, State of Chihuahua. Col. Cano
Is In command of a force of 000 cav
alry which came In contact two days
ago at El Vallo with Villa forces,
which on this occasion, fled without
giving battle. ,
Persons well Informed hero ex
pressed the opinion to-night that
tho Carranza forces had failed to
hold up their end of the net by which
It was proposed to capture tho
chieftain. There Were confirmatory
reports of the news received for the
last week that tho Mexican troops
were not only falling to co-operate
with tho American troops, but in
certain Instances, at least, were ac
tually withdrawing.
