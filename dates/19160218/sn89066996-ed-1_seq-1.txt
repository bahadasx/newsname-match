FURTHER DISCUSSION
OF IMPROVED ROADS
Now is Offered the Golden Opportunity
to Secure Improved Roads to the
Taxpayers' Infinite Profit.
Last week The Times published the
first installment of of arti
cles which will be published in this
paper, from time to time. The pur
pose of these articles will be for
arousing the interest of the public
to the absorbing importance that im
proved roads would be to every per
son within the confines of St. Fran
cois county, as well as to all others
who come into the county.
The advantages of pulling the roads
up out of the mud and giving them a
good, solid foundation, that will not
only shed the water, but will neither
sag, nor mire, arc practically exhaust
haustless; therefore the need of num
berless articles for the proper dis
cussion of this great problem. We
earnestly invite contributions on this
subject, which we will be pleased to
publish.
When the actual conditions and
facts are considered, however, the
question of bringing the roads of St.
Francois county up to a high state of
excellence is not nearly so puzzling
as it proves to be in almost every
other county in the State. When it
is taken into consideration that about
75 per cent, of the taxes of this
county are paid by interests whose
business it is to take from, rather
than to add to, the taxable value of
this county, and whose holdings here
are consequently diminishing from
year to year in this county, should
make it apparent to all that the soon
er the question of permanent good
roads throughout this county is pre
pared for the better it will be for ev
ery resident tax-payer.
Did you ever stop to think that
more than 3,000 men are constantly
employed underground in St. Fran
cois county, taking from the bowels
of the earth resources of the county,
which are immediately shipped out of
the county, thereby depreciating the
actual wealth of this county to the
value of such mineral? A mere su
perficial observer might say that all
this industry results to the advan
tage of this county. But does it?
After this wealth is all removed
from the mines, as it is certain to be
some time, of what value will those
mines be to the county then? They
will he only immense caverns down
under the earth's surface, making
practically valueless the crust above
them.
But The Times has been informed
that these great mining corporations
would perhaps offer no strenuous op
position to paying their part of the
taxes in this county for permanent
road improvement, at least in ac
cordance with their present assessed
valuation. But whether they would
oppose such improvement or not, this
paper believes tkat this matter should
not longer be delayed, as the mineral
wealth is daily being diminished, and
if such holdings can now be made
to pay 75 per cent, of the taxes for
such purpose, does it not, at. best,
appear to be a criminal lack of ini
tiative to longer delay this most im
portant work for the county's good?
court house supplies, $1.25; Deputy
Constable Sam Thompson, quaran
tine services, $6; Morris Bros., book
case for Circuit rooms, $175; A. J.
Hawn, pumping water from court
house basement, $10.65; Missouri Re
formatory, $154.66; D. J. Doughty,
repairs at Inf., $3.65; Constable J. W.
Schaeffer, services, $6; W. T. Haile,
services appertaining to school fund,
$143.33; J. C. Williams, Sheriff, at
tendance on Proabate Court, $18;
J. S. Jarnagin, road overseer, $24.67;
G. Brune, repairing book case, $6.50;
W. T. Haile, County Treasurer, coun
ty criminal cost fee bills, $2,402.73;
While The Times has no desire to
exploit any man, or set of men, to
their advantage or disadvantage, nor
will it consent to do so, it does not be
lieve that the gigantic mining compan
ies are paying their just proportion of
taxes in this county, even though
they are paying 75 per cent, of the
total. They still are not paying to
exceed half as much, according to
their capitalization, as are the town
and country property owners. And
yet their enormous earnings repre
sent wealth that is being taken out
of this county; while the farmer,
merchant and others, when they make
any improvement, add thereby to the
taxable valuation of their property.
Then can you not see and under
stand that, in all fairness, it would
be treating the mine owners fair
yea, more than fair if they were
made to pay at the same rate on their
actual holdings as are the other tax
payers of the county ? If they should
enter any objection to such splendid
treatment, then it might not be amiss
to inject a little of their own medi
cine, and force them to pay an abso
lutely just tax rate, based on the fact
that they get their wealth within this
county and transport it elsewhere.
Can you figure out what rate of tax
ation that would be? We will let
you figure on that.
In the meantime, every citizen of
St. Francois county should get busy
in the interest of permanent improve
ment of every public road within the
confines of the county, while an un
told quantity of the mineral wealth
is still intact. For such improvement
the amount that the average taxpay
er would bp called on to pay would
be almost infinitesimal. There would
be absolutely no comparing such a
small amount to the great and ever
lasting good that must result to ev
ery citizen of the county from per
manent good roads. Get busy NOW,
AND KEEP UP THE AGITATION
UNTIL THIS GREAT GOOD IS AC
TUALLY ACCOMPLISHED.
In this connection, wo want to call
your attention to the manner in which
St. Louis county disposed of a $3,
000,000 bond proposition on Tuesday
of this week, the bonds carrying by a
majority of about six to one. And
this result was secured after a
thorough and painstaking search and
discussion of this important question,
in all its various aspects and ramifica
tions. Practically the same condi
tions are in existence in St. Louis
county as exist in St. Francois coun
ty, except that the county roads there
are not nearly so bad are they are
generally in this county. Neither
has St. Louis county the abundance
of material for road improvement that
St. Francois county has here it
lies practically at the roadside, ready
for use. If St. Louis county's over
whelming verdict in favor of perma
nent good roads was just, then is it
not plainly apparent that the verdict
should be unanimous in this county,
if this proposition is ever put to a
vote?
