PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
No progress on all fronts. During our
Civil War when there had been no tight
ing the headlines of the daily papers us
ed to repeat' All quiet on the Potomac."
These words which then' passed into a
sort of proverb, would however not be
applicable to the present war. Then ar
tillery and trench fighting were ttien of
little importance. To-day these are the
mighty arms of war. Everyday the guns
roar along hundreds of miles of battle
front, every day a few scores of yards

trenches are taken by one side or the
other, every day mines are exploded un
der trenches full of men, every day aero
planes drop bombs, and sea mines and
submarines get in there deadly work.
All this work of "attrition" and "irri
tation" and
ufrightfulness"
is using up
human life at a fearful rate. Battles are
but few, but blood continually flows in
torrents.
Every yard of trenches taken costs the
victors more than it is worth, to them in
sratigecal value. The advantage is ai
most purely local.
England has worked a new plan of
"•voluntary conscription." Under a
plea of patriotism they got nearly all the
men of fighting age to enroll under a de
claration that they would enlist if the
country needed them.
Now the Government has informed all
the young single men that the country
needs
them now. The Empire of late
has been rushing soldiers to the front
and with volunteers in eamp and in the
field it now has a very large army, and
as one result has takan over some forty
miles of battle front formerly occupied
by the French.
The "Lusitana" case has gotten down
to about. this basis Germany says it is
aorry, will not do it again, but Will not
admit that it had no right to do it.
That big operations will occur in the
spring seems certain, but when and
where no one seems to know. Perhaps
even the generals do not know. The
break-up is very likely to be the result
ofacoident.

PRIVATEERS.
During the 16th, 17tb and 18th cent
uries a large part of the "navies" of the
nations of the world were composed of
"privateers". A privateer proper is an
armed vessel owned by private indivi
duals but which fights for its own coun
try and
prey9
on the merchant vessels
owned by the enemy, which prizes be
long to ths captors. In the revolution
ary
war the United States had many of
these privateers and some of the owners
and crew made fortunes.
History informs us however, hat at
least in the older days, that these pri
vateers many times were little better
than pirates and preyed on any com
merce they might come across. Any
way, it is easy to see that any such ships
would not be under the control of their
own governments as they would have
been if they were under regular naval
officers and rules.
As most of these ships were small and
pooriy armed, it was then common for
merchant ships to carry guns for de
fence purposes and perhaps occasionaily
when meeting a weaker ship to become
privatees for the occasion.
The abuses of power made by priva
teersuien at last roused the nations to
make "privateers" and privateering on a
par with piracy. That is, no ship
should be considered as a regulation
lighting ship unless regularly commis
sioned by the government and be mann
ed by officers and crews of the regular
navy, and this has become general inter
national law.
Now, because of the danger from sub
marines, some ocean liners have mount
ed one, two or three guns for defense
purposes only, as they say. It is true
that an ocean going liner with a rifled
gun or two could stand quite a chance
of sinking a submarine as the latter has
generally either no guns or but one or
two.
Now comes [Germany and proclaims,
that hereafter she will treat all ships so
armed as regular naval vessels, which of
course means that she can sink them
without warning if the submarines get
the opportunity.
Further, if these armed merchant
ships come into neutral ports like those
of the United States, then the Unit
ed States should treat them just as if
they were naval vessels of a warring
country, which would mean, that they
could not take passengers or freight and
not remain more .than twenty-four bours
under pehslty of being interned during
the remainder of the war.
It will be seen from this explanation
that the Washington authorities have
another nut added to their collection, to
crack. Also, for the gentlemen who sit
on the boxes at the country grocery
stores and solve the war issues along
with tobacco juice.
NATIONAL COMMITTEEMAN.
Gunder Olson of Grafton is out with
an announcement as a candidate for na
tional committeeman for the Republi
cans of the state. Mr. Olson is one of
the best known businessmen of the state,
having served' as state treasurer for
many years and a resident of Grafton
since that city was placed on the map.
He has been identified with the Republi
can party ever since we learned to know
him, which was in the early 80's and we
never knew him to desert bis colors in
the various political upheavals during
that time and he never allowed himself to
be carried away by extremists in his
own party. With these qualifications
in his favor we see no reason why he
should not represent the Republicans of
North Dakota on the national commit
tee, if he wants to.
Hugh Young, once an employ of this
office has bought a half interest in the
4Neche Chronotype from Editor R. H.
will Fadden. The two, being practical prin-
have to take off their hate for F. A. Will-Iters, will make a good team and giveNe.

STATE CENTRAL COMMITTEE.
THE NEW COLLECTOR
Not a little surprise was sprung in the
district when Washington dispatches
announced the appointment of Alexand
er Morrison as collector of customs of
this district, which includes North and
South Dakota and Noyes, Minnesota.
Only few days before reports came
through the same source tbnt Mr. Me
Arthur chairman of the Democratic
state central committee was slated for
the place and would be appointed forth
with. Although considerable rivalry
had been created through the several as
pirants for the office, the news that Mr.
Morrison had the appointment gave uni
versal satisfaction. Mr. Morrison has
been a staunch Democrat since that par
ty was organized in this county and al
ways ready to promote the interest of
the cause.
The office of collector of customs car
ries a salary of $3,500 and is good for
four years—and longer if the party is
successful at the polls.
Judson LaMoure Jr., the retiring col
lector, has held the office for eight years,
and retires with a clean record and good
wishes of those who have had business
with the office and his subordinates in
the service.
The newly appointed collector was in
Pembina Wednesday, and viewed the
situation before moving here which will
be as soon as he gets his commission
and other matters arranged.
Attorney Percy Hngel who has return
ed to his practice in Winnipeg after ser
ving a two years' sentence at Stony
Mountain for complicity in the Kraf
chenko case,is taking the platform in fa
vor of prohibition ana it i* said be is do
ing good work. It will be remembered
that Mr. Hagel assisted Krafchenko in
making bis sensational escape from the
Winnipeg police. The celebrated attor
ney's plead for prohibition is based on
bis downfall which he claims was due to
drinking.
It begins to look as though Col. Roes
veldt is going to shy his hat into the
ring for the Republican nomination
for president, and if be does there will
be something doing, whethei it will be
to the interest of the party and people or
not.

NATURAL BORN HUNTERS.
Brazilian Nativea Are Only Rivaled by
Those of Auatralia.
If you want to find a thoroughbred
sportsman you must look among the
natives of the Brazilian forests. Eape
"clally among the Botocudo, to whom
tracking game Is the chief business of
his life. He does It with such skill
that be fills the white man with awe
and wonder.
However enthusiastic a huntsman
r°u are you will feel yourself a poor
sportsman after watching him for a
tyttle while. The Botocudo hunter
glides stealthily through the forest
He understands every sign and habit
of bird and beast. He knows
bow
high up an armadillo displaces the
leaves of a tree in passing. He can
distinguish the tracks of the snake
and the tortoise. He can follow the
tortoise to Its burrow by the scratches
of its scaly armor on the mud. His
sense of smell Is so keen that It helps
him a great deal in bunting. Hidden
bfliind the trunk of a tree be can Im
itate the cries of birds and beasts to
bring them within range of bis deadly
poisoned arrow. He can even entice
the alligator by making her rough eggs
grate together where they lie under
leaves on the river bank. If he shoots
at an ape and the animal does not fall
be will climb up after the animal by a
hanging creeper where no white man
would climb. However dark the for
est. he is indifferent to this darkness.
Lnden with bis bag of game be finds
bis way back to his hut by the sun
and the lay of the ground.
His only rival Is the Australian na
tive. He will lie in wait behind a
screen of boughs. He waits until the
kangaroo comes to drink, or he will
track him for days in the open. He
will camp by his fire to be ready for
bis pursuit at early dawn. He keeps
unseen to leeward.
When a number hunt together they
will put up a brush fence in two long
wings, converging toward a pit. and so
drive the kangaroos into it They also
form great hunting parties for a bat
tue surrounding half a mile of busb
laiid. and with shouts and clatter they
drive all the game to the oentpr. where
they can close round and dispatcli
them with spears and waddies. In
fowling the.v show the same adroit
ness. A native will swim under wa
ter. breathing through a reed. He
merely covers his head with water
weed till he gets among a flock of
ducks, which one by one he pulls un
der and tucks into his belt. They
ra|-^lyneed to make use of dogs In
hifsting. though*they had learned this
w:fv of hunting long before the white
man knew anything about it. They
used the dingo or native dog.—Chicago
Herald.
Never Deceive an Animal.
In Farm and Fireside appears the
following advice as to the training ot
animals:
"You never can train a colt, a calf,
or any aniipal, wild or tame, unless
you gain its entire confidence and af
fection. To do this you must never
deceive it. not even for fun. and al
ways protect it and show that you
love it.
'The way to a man's heart is
through bis stomach,' and the road to
the affection of an animal is by way
of Its taste.
"An apple, a bit of tender grass or
some tasty bit will soon make friends
with It, and kind words and petting
will make it a loving and obedient
friend."
The River Jordan.
Religion, history and nature conspire
to make the Jordan the most famous
river of the earth. Accross it the hosts
of Israel weiv led into the Promised
Land In its waters l!ie Christian rite
oi' baptism hr its li'rth: up and down
its valley many civilizations in the
morning of history rose and fell. Per
haps the strangest thing about this fa
mous river is that none of the ancients
ever guessed that its mouth was be
low the level of the sea. It was not
until 1874 that accurate measurements
were made and the mouth of the river
was found 1,292 feet below the Medi
terranean, less than sixty miles away.
The Karroo Bush of 8outh Africa.
The karroo bush provides against
drought by roots of enormous length
stretching under ground to a depth of
many feet At the end of a ten months'
droughty when the earth is baked brick
dust for two feet from the surface, if
you break the dried stalk of a karroo
bush three Inches high you will find
running down the center a tiny thread
of pale green tinted tissue still alive
with sap.
