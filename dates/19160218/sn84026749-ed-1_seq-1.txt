Turk, according to advices from

The Post's Petrogrid correspondent
today attributes the capture ot Erwrum
to the "cyclonic rush of the Incom
parable Siberian troops."
Within 100 Miles.
Erzerum Is only 100 miles from
Trebizond, over the projected railway
line between the two places. Work on
this new railway, It Is understood, was
commenced early In 1914, and was a
'part of the general Turkish scheme for
l ' moving .troops from the Bosphorus by
water to the Erzerum region. The pos-
sesslpn of Treottond will place the Rus
sians within ninety miles of Uatum
This last named port Is connected by
railway with Baku and thence with
Rostov and the entire system of rail
roads In southern Russia. Trebizond
can hardly withstand an advance of a
Russian army from the south suppler
inemeu uy iiosaiuia ueoi builck. irom
seaward.
.Erzerum Is distant from Angora' 265
mile.
Between Angora and Erzerum the pro
jected line runs parallel with the coast
line, the avorago distance Inland being
abount seventy-five miles. The Russians
from their position at Erzerum are at
the base of one of three projected rati
wajv lines, which have been Intended to
fsaect the main coast line with the
sck Sea.
Possible Effects.
If Trebizond falls Into the hands of
the Russians It will be possible to trans
port supplies rapidly from Datum. So
far the Russians have been compelled to
carry supplies up from the Kara region
over the mountains separating Kara
from Erzerum. This portion of the
'Russian advance, It Is declared, has been
the most trying In their experience up
to now. Between Erzerum and Trebl
sond the selected railway rrndlent af
fords favorable facilities for forwarding
purpose.
By. April 25 the River Don, It Is de
clared, will be open to navigation, and
barge traffic from Southern Russia to
Baku can be commented by that ilate.
By April IS navigation will be open
through the Kelch Straits and Sea ot
Asor to. Taganrog, from which last
named place there is railway connection
with all Russia. From Treblxoml to
Taganrog tho distance by wator la 2?u
miles and from Trebizond to Sebastopol
tho water route distance' Is 830 miles.
The port of Sebvstopol Is connected up
by the Crimea railways with the rail

Statement Unexpected.
The dying statement of Schmidt, made
from directly In front ot the chair, was
entirely unexpected. He waa going-to
his death for having killed Anna Au

Into the Hudson river.
Through his attorney he Issued a
statement last night denying that he
had killed the Aumueller girl and as
serting that she died from the effects

SHARP DEBATE! IS MEAUD
"Plraoy," Says Lodge Stool
Promises to Defend PoKcy
of "Administration.
Discussion of tho "armed meft
chantmen'' question, bearing di
rectly on the present controversy
with Germany as to whether sab
marines, without warning, stall at
tack armed liners, flamed up in the1
Senate today.
Senators Sterling and Ledge in
vigorous speeches supported ths;
resolution of Senator Sterling, ofM
posing acquiescence in the notifi
cations of tho Germanic powers M
to future submarine 'activities.
Criticism of the Atainistration'4
foreign policy and unqualified co4
de'mnation of the attitude of ths
central powers ran through both
addresses.
STONE TO REPLY.
Senator Btone, chairman of the IYr
gn notations Committee, who spoke
Hefty-. eiW Benaters SterHnr and
m
fljodgetnalsted the question of.itr4
ImerchHritrrfeh was at least "debatable."
He said he. would discuss IL.xi-week
in a. speech on iueUona ot foreign;
policy and that he would also reply ta
the Root speeclu.
Senator Thomas read Into the, Record
the recent reports that no approval,
of the submarine policy waa Intended
He charged the attacks had been made
tor political effect and not based on
facta or a sincere deslro to. better- tne
nation's International relations.
Senator Sterling charged the Admin
istration with "delaying and hesitating
while the world waa wondering" over
what course would be taken. Ho de
clared acquiescence In the German po
sition "involved consequences more serU
ous than nny that have yet disturbed,
us. grave as some of them have been."
He said it was no remote Inference
that the present uttltude of the German
admiralty "was encouraged, If not In
vited, by the memorandum of our State
Department to the entente powers." He
3uoted a paragraph from the memoran
um Indicating that the department waa
Impressed with the reasonableness of
tho Idea that an armed merchantman,
should be considered an auxiliary cml
scr, and asserted this to be "a danger
ous and vicious principle."
Right of Defense
Senator .Sterling then proceeded to
argue for the right of merchantmen to
arm for defensive purposes and to pro
test emphatically against the proposed
altering of InternaUonal law. . .
Senator Sterling cmphailxed the dan
ger, to American commerce of tha pV.
poed German action.
"Tho vice of the suggestion of the
State Department," ho said, " lies In
this, that because the deadly submarine
Is not strong on dcfMue you must,
therefore, make the merchant ship ab
solutely helpless against tho subma
rine." Criticising the reasoning of the Stats
Departnvent in Its memorandum to the
cntento powers, Senator Sterling In
conclusion said:
"Admit that such reasoning Is right
and that such a principle should pre-'
vail, nnd yoa go haqk to the middle
ages or beyond end set nt naught, tha
work of all the conventions and treaUes
and all the labors of all the interna
tional Jurist for the protection of neu
tral tradn from Grntlus down to the
present time. No. Instead of ylelatnr
to the claims ot tho admiralty, their
very mention should meet with vigor-?
ous protest
Right of Seas.
"Instead of denying this old right ot
the seas we should now, of all times;
vie with her or any other nation la ,
seeking to uphold It. It Is possible
some danger will be Incurred, but I do
not much fear dangers will be mereassa'
beyond what they are at present.
"But I do 'know that let another sea
horror occur tn which American lives
are Involved and this AdmtnlstraUoa
and the world will know that there is
a real America, not supine, apathetic
nnd hesitating, but strong, militant. If
need be and ready to respond to those
noble Impulses of liberty and humanity
which have been our heritage from the
Beginning.
''If perchanca wantonness and lafcu
manlry shall yet cost- ua something, the
sacrlflco may not have been In vain,
"To prohibit forever the destruction ot
commerce and passenger-carrying ves
sels by means and at risks that shock
humanity and shame our civilisation."
he said, would, be the new problem ot
peace commissioners. International Jur
ists and others
ttcnator Lodge called the German
program nothing less than piracy.
Atter citing precedents that arming
merchantmen for dorense has been al
lowed since the days of Uarbary pi
rates and that It has been approved by
thn United States during the present
war, he declared that to change this
policy now wotnd be to commit aa un
neutral act- :n favpr of, Germany.
"The abandonment of. the right of
merchant vessels to arm. or of the right
of Americana to travel or ship cargo
on theso ships. 1h "Utterly Incredible
Such abandonment could rest only on
the ground that the rights of neutrals,
centuries old, must be thrown aside so
