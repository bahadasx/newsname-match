Why Elsie Was Sent f Bed.
While littlf Elmo's older sister,
May, was enter! nining her latent ac
quisition, li mnut dignified und cn
teel young num. in the parlor ) ?
was relofntfd to the dining room to
play with her doll.
This J nrf ietilnr one, the possessor
of a kid hod and a bisque hoad, had
been somewuat ailing of lato,. wring
to the fact that its head was grad
ually becoming detached a. id its
pivotal eyes refused to perform
their functions of opening and
closing.

Elsie made the discovery that there
was something inside of it and final
ly succeeded in extracting a large
roll of tightly curled hair. A mo
ment later she burst into the par
lor in a great state of excitement
and shouted:

Second Thoughts,
"It cannot bo," sighed the maid.
"1 rpect you highly, Mr. Hunter,
but we are compatible."
"Wei?, 1 suppose it cannot be
helped' the young man replied,
pocketing his chagrin and looking
tbout for In hat, "but it defeats all
my cherished hopes. I had planned
a house in which I fondly in gined
we might be happy. It was to have
had a pantry twice as large rj the
ordinary size, with a roomy closet in
which to stow away the new cooking
utensils and thing that a woman
naturally buys when a peddle
comes around."

Oliver Wendtll Holmes, it will be
recalled, remarked that the axis of
the earth nticks out in every man's
back yard. A bonmot of not dis
limilar kind is recorded of Wash
ington Irving.
The conversation was turned on
the pomposity of a certain Ameri
can diplomatist.
"Ah, he is a great man," said
Irving, "and in his own estimation
a very groat man a man of great

Not Afraid of a Ghost.
In a Kliatre in England a man
went running into an nxm, at 8
o'clock at night and criei tftti tiba
there was a ghost in his htuck jaitf
There wore fourteen men in trr
Inn, and not one of them dared to
go home with fhe man and investi
gate. Thre was a person who
dared, however, and that was the
landlord's daughter, a girl of four
teen. Some of the men followed
her at a distance, and she went into
the yard and up to the ghost, flap
ping its arms about, and discovered
i man's white shirt flapping on tho
clothesline in a strong breeze.

A Sure Investment.
You have never yet made an investment
Where you didn't expect to win,
But you sometime have found to your sorrow
You've beautifully taken in.
You may have laid down your good money
For a brick which you found wasn't gold,
Or met the Bohemian oats swindler,
When you, with yoaroats, have been sold.
If asked by a friend to play poker,
You'd experience, no doubt quite a shock;
Then never join hands with a fellow
Who makes money by watering stock.
Now if you would like an investment
