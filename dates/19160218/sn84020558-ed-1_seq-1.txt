WILSON, THROUGH LANSING, TELLS
OF RECOGNITION OF CARRANZA
In Response to Fall Resolution President Sends to Sen
ate Report on Facts Leading Up to Recognition By
United States of De Facto Government of Mexico
It Is In Form of Long Letter from Secretary Lansing
Summarizing Events Which Preceded Recognition and
Transmitting Great Volume of Data, Including List
of All Americans Killed
During the Past Six Years
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17. President Wilson sent to
the senate today his response to the Fall resolution
adopted last month requesting him to report on facts
leading up to recognition by the United States of the de
facto government of Mexico headed by General Venus
tiano Carranza. It was ju the foiyn of a long letter from
Secretary Lansing, summarizing the events which pre
ceded recognition and transmitting a great volume of
data, including a list of all Americans killed in Mexico
and along the border during the past six years.
The president, through Mr. Lansing, declined to
comply with that part of the Fall resolution asking for
diplomatic and consular reports on political conditions
and events in Mexico. The senate was informed that it
was not compatible with public interests to furnish this
correspondence inasmuch as it was of a highly confi
dential nature, and "submitted by consular officers of
the United States, by diplomatic or consular officers of
other governments, which have graciously consented
that their officers might supply this government with in
formation during the necessary absence of American
representatives, and by other persons residing in Mexico.
As to the ability of Carranza to ful-j '
fill his promises to protect foreign sing called attention to the fact that.
lives anil property,
Mr.
Lansing said .
that under the circumstances the de
facto government, which at the time made representations for the appre
of recognition controlled more than I tension and punishment of the assail
75 per cent of Mexico's territory, was ' ,nts
affording "reasonably adequate pro
tection to the lives and property of
American citizens."
The data disclosed that seventy-six
Americans were killed in Mexico in the
years 1913, 1914, 1915, as compared with
forty-seven in the three years pieced-
ing, and that twenty civilian Americans
and sixteen soldiers were killed on
American soil in the last three years
as a result of Mexican troubles.
When the 'report was received. Sen
ator Stone, chairman of the foreign
relations committee, moved that it lie
on the table and be printed as a public
document, lie made no comment on
its contents. Senator Fall expressed

dent-ial correspondence.
The response to the resolution is ex
pected to stir up a new discussion of
the situation in the senate and to bring
a vote quickly on the nomination of
ltenry I'rather Fletcher as amhassa-
dor to Mexico. Senator Fall intro
duced his resolution when the nomi
nation was sent in. Republican mem
bers of the foreign relations commit
tee held that the senate should not
conesnt to sending an ambassador to
Mexico until it was thoroughly in
formedTas to the character of the gov
ernment to which he was to be accred
ited. In view of the report it is prob
able that the foreign relations commit
tee will pass on Mr. Fletcher's nomi
nation next Wednesday.
Included in the documents sent to
the senate were copies of President
Wilson's appeal to the Mexican fac
tions last June, urging them to get
together; data regarding the- Pan
American conference; a copy of the ap
peal to the factions issued by the Pan
American conference; correspondence
between the state department and
Carranza: communications from Eliseo
Arredondo, the Mexican ambassador -designate
to the United States, rela
tive to guarantees of protection to for
eigners, indemnities and "individual
freedom of worship;" copies of tele
grams regarding war department
operations during border troubles, and
reports on the taking and evacuation
of Vera Cruz, and many other sub
jects. The correspondence also included a
letter from former Secretary Garrison
to Secretary Lansing, dated January
26, 1918, containing a general report of
the army operations to suppress bor
der uprisings last fall.

CHICAGO, Feb. 17. Warning was
sent to Chicago churches today by the
l.olice to establish a guard about their
premises "as the result of evidence
disclosed in the hunt for Jean Crones,
the University Club chef, who is al
leged to have poisoned soup served at
the bamiuet last Thursday night to
Archbishop George W. Mundelein.
The evidence disclosed both by let
ters and agents working with the an
urchists, the police declared, indicated
that an anti-clerical demonstration of
wide extent ad been planned by a
group of anarchists known as the
"sympathizers." Details of the plot
were withheld by the police, but it
was said their information disclosed
that the torch had been suggested foi
t number of churches, as well as the
use of -bombs.
Photographs aind drawings of
churches in other large cities, the po-
l lice said, were found in the raid On
Crone's room and subsequent investi
gation had disclosed an anti-clerical
plot of wide ramifications.
The nation-wide search for Crones
continued today.
The letter signed with the missins
man's name which was received yes
terday by a New York newspaper,
found confirmation in two particulars.
Th nrli,.p here admitted that asbes-
and not gun,.oUon, was found in
two cans in Crones' room, just as the
letter stated, and city chemists re
I ported that their tests had revealed a
, second mineral poison in the soup
: samples, as the letter indicated. The
J recond poison, according to the health
department analysists, would tend to
act as an antidote for the stronger
' i,niarn inflnriner ereat nausea.
Government officials who have
scrutinized the mass of letters seized
by the police in the poison plot took
the view that indications of a wide
spread anti-governmefit sonspiracy
had been brought to light and advo
cated immediate steps to defeat it.
A plan to utilize a force of fifty se
cret service men In raids on anar
chistic centers was discussed.
Crones Sends Finger Prints
NEW YORK, Feb. 17. Another 1 et
Ifr purporting to be signed by Jean
Crones was received tonight by th
New York Times. It was mailed in
this city late in the afternoon, and is
believed by the police to be genuine.
The writer of the letter taunts the
police, encloses his "finger prints" to
aid them, welcomes the coming of Chi
cago detectives to assist in his cap
ture, tells why he attempted to poison
300 men, and hints of something he
will "let go" when Chicago detectives
reach the city. .

battle cruisers were more urgently
needed than battleships and recom
mended the construction of four such
vessels tl.is year if congress would
authorize no more capital ships rath
er than two battleships and two bat
tle cruisers as proposed
Captain McKean told the committee
that the proposed five year building
plan was based on the best judgment
of the naval department; that it was
the only definite navy increase pro-
i gram ever presented for approval of
I congress, and that it was calculated
to give the country's ship builders
an idea of what they might look for
ward to.
Admiral Grant supplemented his
previous statement urging the con
struction of only 800 tons submarines
in the future, abandoning present
smaller types altogether and discon
tinuing building the fleet submarine
class of 1200 to 1300 tons until the
first of these! boats, the Schley, has
been tried out. As to the need of
small craft for harbor work, be in
sisted the place for submarine oper-
ations was outside, not inside a
harbor.
In response to questions by Rep
resentative Kelly, Captain McKean
said he thought the plan outlined by
the general board of establishing a
navy second to none by 1925 was the
wisest one, as the nation might have
to face several enemies at once.
Captain McKean disclosed the fact
I that a far reaching scheme for mo-
I bilizing the navy yards is being

SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Feb. 17.
Testimony that the plaintiffs had failed
to do assessment work on about two
thirds of the potash claims at Searles
Lake, San Bernardino county, during
1911 and 1912, was given today by L.
D. Rasor, a witness in the suit to eject
the California Trona company from the
property.
The evidence was brought during the
questioning of the witness by Judge H.
T. Devvhirst, of the superior court, in
whose department the case is being
tried.
Rasor testified that assessment work
was done on only 55 or 56 claims dur
ing 1911 and 1912. He said a lack of
funds made it impossible" to do the
woik on the other claims during that
period. The testimony was given by
Rasor over the objections of the attor
neys for the plaintiffs, R. Waymire and
E. Thompson, who originally called the
man ab a witness.
FEEL EFFECTS OF
RED LIGHT LAW
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 17 The full
penalties of the state red light abate
ment act were imposed for the first
time here today when Superior Judge
G. A. Sturtevant closed four tenderloin
resorts, ordered the confiscation of the
personal property of the tenants and of
the furnishings and furniture in the
houses and decreed that the places
must r;main vacant lor one year.
The confiscated property, according
to the court's decree, will be sold by
the police to defiay the cost of the
prosecution.
It was charged that the places were
used for immoral purposes and the de
cree, according to legal authorities
here, will have the effect, if sustained
by the higher courts, of closing every
immoral resort in the state.

on as a witness for the contestants and
ths defense took him in hand and
forced the admission regarding the fee.
Judge Thomas testified he believed
Mr. Beale of unsound mind because he
went -.round to women asking them
about the inheritance tax.
When the court remarked this cir
cumstance did not impress him. Judge
Thomas interrupted "I would say it
was proof that he was certainly de
mented." The taking of testimony was con

WASHINGTON, Feb. 17. The
United States in its submarine con-
1 troversy with Germany will accept
nothing short of a full and complete
agreement covering all the points for
which it has contended as to assur
ances that the warfare in the future
I will be conducted in accordance with
the established principles of inter
national law
1 In announcing that fact today. Sec
i retary Lansing let it be known that
the state department considers Ger
many's declaration of its intention to
sink without warning after February
2'J all armed merchant ships of the
entente allies to be inconsistent with
j the assurances previously given this
J government by the Berlin foreign of
. fice.
The tentative communication de
signed to end the Lusitania case,
I still in the possession of Secretary
Lansing, will not be formally accepted
until such assurances regarding the
future are given, although the com
munication insofar as it relates to the
Lusitania itself is acceptable.
! State department officials also con
: sider that the Austro-Hungarian
memorandum regarding armed ships
is not in accord with the assurances
given by that government in the ne
gotiations over the sinking of the
Italian steamship Ancona. Conse
quently final settlement of the An
'ona case, once postponed because of
. Oie doubt regarding the circumstances
of the sinking of the British steam
ship Persia, probably will be with
held until Austria gives similar as
surances to those now requested from
Germany.
The views of the United Slates
were explained in detail today by
Secretary Lansing to Count von Bern
storff, the German ambassador, who
was informed, it was indicated at the
i state department, that, the l'nited
j States desires the German declaration
t regarding armed merchant ships-to be
modified.
Later in the day the ambassador
sent a long dispatch to his govern
ment explaining the position and, re
quirements of the United States. It
was understood that the ambassador
informed his ' government that the I
United States wanted particularly to j
know whether the assurances prev
iously given in the Lusitania and the
Arabic eases still were in force.
Tonight it was said emphatically in
Teutonic diplomatic circles that the
Berlin foreign office would not mod
ify the declaration of intention to sink
armed ships, or inform the United
States the previous assurances still
were binding, unless Great Britain
should give assurances of some kind
that a submarine which warns a
British steamship, armed ostensibly
for defensive purposec, would not he
fired" upon.
In this connection it was explained
nt the state department that the
United States considers unarmed mer
chant ships and ships armed for de
fensive purposes to be in identically
the same class. Furthermore, it is
held that the word "liners" as em
ployed in the previous assurances
from Germany regarding the conduct
of submarine.' warfare. Includes freight
as well as passenger ships.
It was declared at the department
that no suggestions have been made
to the German government which
would have led it to issue its latest
memorandum. This answered state
ments made by German officials that
the American memorandum to the en
tente allies suggesting a modus Vi
vendi for the disarming of merchant
ships was the direct cause of Ger
many issuing her declaration.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 Two
views of Louis D. Brandeis was
placed today before the judiciary
sub-committee of the senate investi
gating his fitness to be a supreme
court justice.
The first witness. Moorfield Storey,
a .Boston lawyer, said Mr. Brandeis'
reputation at the Boston bar was
that he was a "very capable, very en
ergetic and if necessary to advance
his objects, he is not scrupulous as
to his methods, or is he to be
trusted."
The second witness. Sherman L.
Whipple of Boston, described Mr.
Brandeis as a man with sincere, high
minded motives, intensely centered in
carrying out his own ideas and
ideals: in love with the idea that he
was "looking after the situation;"
possibly a bit careless in his con
nection with one of his cases, and
as holding himself aloof with the
result that he had been misjudged.
Moses J. Stroock, a New York law
yer, testified briefly. He quoted Mr.
Brandeis as having said that every
one should get a square deal in the
James T. Lennox bankruptcy case,
which has been much discussed at the
hearing.
Mr. Storey told the committee he
thought Mr. Brandeis had been un
ethical in bringing ten suits against
the New England railroad in 1S92 for
interests other than the actual, com
plainants, which preceded by a year
the bankruptcy of the New England
road from which it emerged in pos
session of the New Haven road. He
was unwilling, however, to give his
opinion that Mr. Brandeis was em
ployed to wreck the New England
road. In the Warren will case, Mr.
Storey thought -Mr. .Brandeis had
. acted as he himself would have done.
I After expressing his opinion that as
I a lawyer, Mr. Brandeis was "able and
learned; as a man, conscientious and
j high minded," Mr. Whipple said he
j thought that Mr. Brandeis had pos
I sibly been careless in the Warren
I case in not making clear to Edward
Warren all the effects of the tran
saction. He added that he had cross
examined Samuel Warren and was
convinced that "there was no taint of
dishonesty in the ease."
'I think they have misjudged - Mr.
Brandeis," Mr. Whipple said. "If he
had been different, had not ' so held
aloof, had mingled more with the bar,
discussed doubtful points with other
lawyers, they would not have mis-

Estimates at Petrograd place the
number of troops in the Turkish gar.

has been announced, at 100,000. The
guns numbered more than 1,000. But
it has not yet been officially stated
that all of these troops and guns were
taken by the Russians.
That the fighting before the fortress
fell was terrific' is indicated by a
Constntinople dispatch, which although
not announcing the capture of Erzer
um, says that in the last three days
before the communication was issued,
the Russians had lost 5,000 men killed.
Both Berlin and Paris report that
there have been flo important devel
opments on the battle line in Prance
and Belgium. .On the Russian front
their have been artillery engagements
and isolate infantry actions at vari
ous points. In east Galicia hostilities
l-ave almost ceased for the present.
The Italians are still engaged in
shelling the positions taken from them
recently by the Austrians on the Rom
lion sector, and also are keeping up
their military actions against the
bridgeheads at Tolmino and Gorizia.
An infantry attack against Mont San
Michele is reported by Vienna to have
been repulsed.
LONDON, Feb. 18. There is still no
reliable data on the number of Turks
captured, at the fall of Erzerum, ac
cording to the Petrograd correspond
ent of the Times. General Judenich
is now confronted with the difficult
task of intercepting the remnants
of the Turkish defenders, who prob
ably are retreating westward of the
mountain plateau, and so prevent them
from joining other units of the third
Turkish army1.
In an account of the siege, General
Judenich says the advance toward
Erzerum was conducted on threa
routes, namely, on the northern flank
ly way of Olti, by a frontal and
shorter route along the Kars-Erzer-
um road by way of Sarl Kamish and
on the southeastern flank by way
of Melazghert and Khynisskala. The
downfall of the fortress, however,
was mainly the result of the frontal
attack, although the heavy artillery

tilo marine, which is limited in size,
has to carry out task far greater
than in time of peace. The shipping
problem has become' the greatest ec-
jonomic problem of the day. Where

"You see we are dependent to an
enormous extent on the services of
neutral shipping, and if we drive it
away by any system of low maximum
rates, or a similar device, we shall
starve. If we fix maximum rates be
low the world level, we shall drive
neutral shipping to ports where high
er rates are obtainable."
