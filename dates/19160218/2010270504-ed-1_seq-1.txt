guosts wore ontortnlneil lu regal
stylo at the Lloyd Inst evening on tho
j occasion of tho second annual bnnqum
of that organization. Viewed as an
entertaining proposition, It could not
nnvo uren improved. The menu served
by Caterer Hupfer was very satisfying,
the music by Stamp's orchestra splen
did, tho addresses by Colonol Griffith
and Dr Somors of Omaha and M. Keith
Neville Interesting and tho cabaret
Btunts projected by Col. J. "llclnsco"
McDonald and produced by his eight
vory clever specialists proved n
screnm.
It was nearly nine o'clock when
nearly two hundred men surrounded
tho llower bedecked banquot tablos
and drank n toast proposed by Dr.
Fred J, Wurtele. A seven course nlco
ly prepared and well served dinner
followed, nnd tho toastmaster then In
troduced Colonel Griffith, district dep

of the wonderful growth of tho Mooso
order now with a membership of
700,000 and gave a summary of tins

hart, 111., In taking care of GOO or
phans of Moose members, giving
these ehnrgos a splondltl education
and teaching them tho several voca
tions of life. Dr. Somors, state dicta
tor, followed with an address tolling
of the good work the Mooso are doing,
and advising those who nrc not mem
bers to investigate the many advan
tages offered by the order. M. Keith
Neville, wns Introduced as tho "next
governor of Nebraska," and it was a
couple of minutes before the applause
quieted and Mr. Neville could bo hoard.
He slated thnt ho had announced his
candidacy for the nomination for gov
ern cr nfter he had convinced himself
that lit' stood a good show of securing
it and was sanguine of success. Though
a total abstainer he did not favor pro
hibition, though if elected and the dry
element voted ngalnst license his ac
tions us governor would bo fully In
accord with tho will of tho people.
And then the Colonel's company of
entertainers wore Introduced. First,
a quartette Messrs. Clinton McGov

tcrtahicd thnt the laugh of the audi
tors was of tho continuous disconnect
ed kind. "Safety First," a parody on
a popular song as well as on the slo
gan wns enacted by the male quartet.
The first verso related to "safety
Ilrst" on tho part of tho engineer and

the stage of a good-sized well made
locomotive with drlvo wheels revolv
ing, sldo rods In motion nnd tho on
gneer In tho cab working his mov
able jJirottlo and revcrso lover. As
tho engine reached tho center of the
stage the red light (lashed ami tho
emergency brake applledv Another
verso told of the autoist who attempt
ed, in passing over tho crossing, to
beat tho fast moving trnln, nnd this
was enacted by the appearance 03 an
nuto driven by Dave Day. Tho con
cluding verse told of the highwayman
who' lnld in wnit for you, but to foil
him you should rde an aeroplane In
stead of walking, and nt this juncture
a (lying machine with Will Friend In
the enr came sliding down a wire
which ran from the celling on th"
south ond of the hall to the stage. Kn
routo inflated hog bladders wore drop
ped as bombs. ,

We are now in a position to show yon the New Buick
Model D-6-'15, which has been the one real sensation in the
automobile world since January first.
Gome In and See It
See for yourself how really wonderful this model is,
with its six cylinder Buick valve-in-head motor; its Buick
cantilever springs; its cellular radiator; its silk mohair one
man top; its genuine leather upholstering; its new style elec
tric headlamps, and its many other superiorities as compared
with other cars.
With its crown fenders and 34x4 inch wheels.and tires,
this model is truly the superior of any car in its class, and the
equal of any car in any class in appearance and performance.
Place Your Order Now
Thousands were disappointed last fall by not being able
to get a Buick, and the demand for early spring deliver)' is
even' now greater than experienced last fall. Make sure of
your Buick before it is too late. We are now in position to
