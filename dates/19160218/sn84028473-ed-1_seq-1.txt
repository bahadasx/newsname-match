Lincoln heard their story then said
Why gentlemen Uncle Sam is now
borrowing millions of money from
Wall Street at 12 per cent and wo
cant afford It but if I were as rich
as you arc and as badly scared as you
pretend to bo I would go homo and
build a few gunboats of my own and
not call upon a bankrupt government
for uefense What we now need Is
good roads and plenty of them and
noi rapid firing guns Give us some
thing constructive and not destructive
Ten years ago Lt Hobson had so scar
ed congress over tho Yellow peril

ton and San Francisco tu tako up a
collection
I am with president Grant at tho
close of the rebellion when he said
Let us havo peace I am for peace

any price Yet in buslucss and do
mestic affairs It is as plain as letters
on a box car that we must have a lit
tle preparedness mixed in with our
soup It would bo foolish for tho
Dispatch after this weeks issuo not
lo prepare for the next for tho busi
ness man who aavertises not to pre
pare for business for tho Erie not lo
prepare for the big crowds at the Can
Held fair for the good housewife not
to preparo for dinner evon if the old
man should remain out all night play
ing poker the school boy or girl not
to preparo for examination the doc
tor and undertaker not to proparo for
tho grip to bit the town or for sin
ners to meet God Yet If lt is a crime
for a single citizen to carry a revolver
or for ono man to kill another Is lt
not wrong for a nation to go loaded
or for one nation to stand up and
shoot at another nutlon slmpy be
cause ono side makes mouths at tho
other Let those who favor war do
the fighting and not have those who
wear wooden shoes fight to keep the
golden crown upon a favored few
It may appear strange though nev
ertheless true that Samuel Morgan
who wroto his Freemasonry Expos
ed and was supposed by many to
havo been thrown over Niagara Falls

yard located upon tho farm of Biugloy
Kussell thergrave yard fence being
the lino which separates Carroll from
Columbiana county near Salluovllle
Morgan being an uncle of jny wife I
visited his grave and gave the sub

book In my library and from the pub
Ushers introduction I quote the follow
Ing from the first paragraph In tho
absence of the author or rather com

Morgan bad been living a pollgamous
