'WITHDRAWS AS A CANDIDATE
FOR GOVERNOR
Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh
of this city, the first man to file as a
candidate for the republican nomina
tion for governor of Minnesota, has
withdrawn from the race in favor of
Governor Burnquist. The decision was
reached at a conference between the
congressman and the governor the lat
ter part of last week.
In answer to numerous inquiries as
to the truth of the statement issued
by Governor Burnquist in regard to
his resignation, Mo*. Lindbergh con
firmed th& statement and stated that
he had taken this action only after
satisfying himself that the present
governor was generally favorable to
the same progressive government that
he was.
A full statement will be given by
Mr. Lindbergh concerning his with
drawal from the gubernatorial race.
TAXES COMINb IN FASTER
County Treasurer Renick stat^s that
the personal property taxes are com
ing in much faster this wepk^ a gain
of more than a hundred receipts hav
ing been made the last week/' Tues
day, February 29, is the, last day on
which to pay: the. personal ptbperty
tax to escape penalty, as the ten per
cent increase is made on March 1. The
public examiner has notified the treas
urere that the law in regard to this
must be complied with.
A meeting of the board' of public
works will be held Thursday evening
of next week for the purpose of acting
on the petition for a sewer on Broad
way east, from the site for the feder
al building to connect with the old

Rev. John-Watson was in Randall
yesterday to officiate at a wedding. ...
Tonight the local high school basket
ball team tackles the Sauk Centre
high school squad on the local floor.
The game will begin at 8:15 p. in. A
big crowd should turn out and help
the local 'boys to victory.
Little Falls won from Sauk Centre
high in the second game of the season
at that plaoe, and this is a return
game. While the Sauk Centerites have
no doubt strengthened considerably
since that time the local boys have
done likewise and hope to capture the
visitors' scalp again.
Next Tuesday the locals play Bemid
ji high on the local floor. This will
also be a" return game, the locals be
ing defeated by-the up-state quint on
February 5*" This game promises to
be a fast "one as the locals are anx
ious to administer, .a defeat to the vis
itors "that willbe even more one-sided
than that handed them by Bemidji. If
the locals can win this game by a larg
er score than the score of the game
they lost, they will still have a chance
to win the district championship.

STA®E INSPECTOR PHILLIPS
MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO
i, SCHOOL BOARD
As the result of the visit of E. M.
Phillips, state school inspector, to this
city Tuesday, several needed improve
ments will no doubt be made in the
public schools here before long. Mr.
Phillips examined the school property
particularly from the point of physical
betterment and made several recom
mendations to the school board. It is
anticipated that he will" write the
board a letter naming the changes and
improvements that he has recommend
ed. Mr. Phillips was well pleased with
the work done in the schools here and
expressed satisfaction at the manner
in which the public schools here are
run.
Mir. Phillip's plan is, to have the
school bpard map out a definite plan
of work for a number of years to come
so as to have something to work on
each year. His first suggestion or re
commendation is that a fan ventilat
ing system be installed in the Lincoln
school on the West side. The cost of
installing the system there would not
be very great, he says, as the flues are
already there and practically all that
is needed is the fan and the motive
power to operate it. He stated that
it would not pay to install, ventilating
systems in the Columbia or Hawthorne
buildings as the buildings are too old.
He. recommended that the plumbing
system at the Central building be ov
erhauled thoroughly. He also recom
mended that shades similar to those
used in the high school building be
placed in the rooms in all the grade
buildings, in place of the opaque
shades now in use.
These matters will probably be tak
en up at a meeting of the school board
in the hear future.
A light rain fell here early yester
day morning and also yesterday after
noon. The temperature was above the
50 mark yesterday afternoon and the
snow melted fast but as vet the sleigh
ing has not been, affected materially as
the snow was unusually deep.
P. J. Vasaly, editor of the Herald,
went to Minneapolis yesterday morn
ing to attend the annual meeting of
the Minnesota Editorial association.
The convention began yesterday and
closes tomorrow. The organization is
celebrating its golden jubilee at this
meeting, having been organized for 50
years.
