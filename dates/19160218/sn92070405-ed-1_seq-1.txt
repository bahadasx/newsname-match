MAY IMPORT LIQUOR
INTO ARIZONA FOR
PERSONAL
USE
The state supreme court of Ari
zona has decided the the importa
tion of liquor for "personal use"
was not in violation of state pro
hibition. The decision was made in thf
case of W. J. Sturgeon, convictet1
in Yuma county on the charge of
introducing a quart of wine inte
the state. Sturgeon contended he
brought it in for personal use. Su
perior Court Judge Baxter held
that his act was in violation of the
law. ,
The supreme court held that
Baxter erred in refusing the appel
lant's offer of evidence that he
brought the liquor in the stajte for
personal use.
"It Í3 not unlawful in Arizona to
have or to personally use intoxi
cating liquors," the opinion stated
The court's opinion stated:
"The introduction of liquor in
to the state for personal use is no1
prohibited by the Webb-Kenyor
act. The prohibition amendment in
so far as it attempts to interdict
the shipment, transportation of, or
introduction of liquor in the state
for lawful purposes is ineffectual
as it is an attempt to regulate in
terstate commerce."
. Hundreds of orders for liquor
we're telegraphed outside of the
state following the decision, it is
reported.-

AT THE CHURCHES
- Rev. E. C. Morgan of the Metho
dist church of Deming exchanged
pulpits with Rev. W. S. Kuggett
Sunday and delivered two excel
lent termons whicn were heard by
;.rre congregations. Rev. Mor
gan is a fluent speaker and has a
captivating delivery in "putting
over" his big truths. Both of his
sermons here Sunday were ' of
great benefit to those who attended
and all appreciate having him here
for the occasion.
Sunday evening" at the Baptist
church Rev. J. A. Land delivered
one of the most interesting and
"hard hitting sermons ever
preached in Lordsburg and one
that the entire community would
have received much benefit from
The theme of Rev. Land's sermon
was "Indifference," giving the var
ious reasons for religious stagna
tion in Lordsburg, which has failed
to be revived after many, many
evangelistic meetings. "The trru.
ble is with too many people saying
'Let them do it,' when they them
selves are the ones who should take
action first," said Rev. Land. The
sermon was one not only for the
members of the Baptist church,
but every church member in Lords
burg, and it should be repeated at
a mass meeting.
MINES AND MINING
OLD TIMER HERE
James T. Wing, of Johnson,
Ariz., was here last Friday greet
lng his many friends and renewing
old acquaintances. Mr. Wing is
well known in Lordsburg and in
southern Grant county, where he
has been interested in mining for
the past half century.. At one
time Mr. Wing . was master-me
chanic at the old Carlisle mine at
Steeplerock during the height of
its activity. He predicts that the
property will "come back" and that
when unwatered the high grade
ores will be found as well as im
mense bodies of milling ores.
Mr. Wing is an interesting con
versationalist and will always find
the latch string out at the Liberal
office. ,
George H. Utter, owner of the
Carlisle. Jim Crow and other pro
perties at Steeplerock, was here on
Saturday en route to his home in
Silver City. Mr. Utter reports the
Carlisle nearly unwatered. The
400 foot level has been reached and
by the end of the week the winze
from the 4U0 to the duo iooi levei
is expected to be from under water.
Immense bodies of complex ores
have been found during the unwa
tering and every indication points
to a revival of big things at the
famous Carlisle.
Six men on each division of the
S. P. and in each general shop who
rank highest in safety points scor
ed will be presented with an at
tractive watch fob with a rolled
gold charm at the end of the fiscal
year closing June 80, 1916.
On the fa-e of the charm wiil be
inscribed the company's safety em
blem and on the reverse side the
name of the employe to whom
awarded will be inscribed. The
1 points are computed from the Hum
I ber of safety suggestions offered,
I the character and importance of
the suggestions being considered.
