Work has been Started.
II. W. Elliott begun drilling his
deep vi 11 tceiy i Hi- ranch
east of town. Ho fs sinking a ten
inch hole and has scoured the
service of at export driller and-
the work will proceed very rap
Idly if the unexpected doas not
happen in the way of a break
down, or something.
It is Mr. Elliott's intention to
drill until lie gets a good supply
of water If ho has to go 1000 feet
or deeper, though he does not
figure on stopping before ho rea
ches the 1000 foot level. The
drilling means much to the fut
ure of tiie valley and the outcome
will be watched with Interest.
Donations are being solicited
and the business men of Colum
bus with only one exception have
expressed themselves as willing
to assist. Four different men
have offered to give $1 when a
depth of 500 feet has been reach
ed: $2 at the GOO foot level; $1 at
the 700 foot level; $8 at the 800
foot level; and $10 at the 000 foot
level; providing that the other 100
foot is to be sunk. This would
make a total of $31, and if the
rest of the business people of
Columbus will agree to do this
the amount necessary tomake up
the balance required can be re
ceived without much trouble
from non-rc&idsnts.
This opportunity of gotting a
deep test well should not be pass
ed up. Mr. Elliott is agreeing
to stand the large part of the ex
puiiai', and the pi'iilmijhitics aiu
that we will never have another
opportunity ' to-get a test well
down with so small cost to the
other peoplo of the valley.
Small Fire In Home
Last Friday evening at a late
hour at the home of G. W. Far
rar a gasolene lamp almost
caused a destructive tire. The
residence was built of adobe,
which fact probably saved tho
building. . It took some very
rapid work to extinguish the
flames, Mr. F.irrar's daughter
was very badly burned on the
hands and face and ono of tho
boys also suffered numerous
bums. Very little property
loss was realized.

Somebody said that it could'nt be done.
But he with a chuckle replied:
That "maybe it couldjnt," but he would be one
Who would'nt say so till he'd tried.
So he buckled right in, with a trace of grin
On his face. If he worried, he hid it.
He started to sing as he tackled the thing
That could'nt be done and he did it.
Somebody scoffed: "Oh, you'll never do that
At least no one has ever done it;"
But he took off his coat and he took off his hat,
And the first thing we knew he'd begun it,
With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,
Without any doubting or quit it.
He started to sing as he tackled the thing
That could'nt be done and he did it.
There arc thousands who'll tcllyou it cannot be
done
There are thousands who phophesy failure;
There arc thousands to, point out to you, one
by one,
The dangers that wait to assail you.
But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,
Then take off your coat and go to it,
Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing
That "cannot be done" and you'll do it.

Good advice for New Mexico
Farmers.
"Get a cow, get a pig, get a lot
hens," is the way out of tho wild
erness of debt fo good folks who
have been croppers instead of
real farmers. Tho Chickasha
Star tells of one farmer in Grady
county, central Oklahoma, who
got a pig. Hero is tho sto ry,
"Last spring I bought a young
sow from a neighbor for $15.00.
She brought pigs and we saved
nine. Yesterday we sold the sow
and five of her pigs to a local deal
er for $107.03. We have four left
and are still in the hog business.
This is the hruest dividend I ev
er received on such a small am
ount of money Invested."
Growing into live stock farm
Ing Is always safe. Jumping in
to It Is always risky. One cow
soon develops into two, ono sow
into 10, one hen into 100. Milk
and butter, eggs and fried chick
en, all produced for homo con
sumption, with enough surofood
crops to take good care of tho an
Iraals that produce them are al
ways safe. They are the found
ation of safe farming everywhere.

The Town Wells.
T.ie public well in the Rice ad
dition is having some very badly
needed repairs made this week.
Tho well has not supplied any
water for several weoks and now
a new pump and pipe has been
installed, and the water question
in that part of town will not be
of so serious a nature.
The city pump has bean in fine
working condition for the past
two weeks and a good supply of
water has been kept at all times.
J. H. Cox, tho present pumper,
has overhauled the engine and
put it in good working condition.
The fuel bill has been cut in half
and the water service i s
now satisfactory. Tho well tho
ugn, is of small capacity and it
keeps the engine going all the
tlmo during tho day to supply
the uemand, When the summer
season arrives this well will not
snpply a sufficient amount of
water ana some otnor means
should now be considered. The
new city well should bo equipped
by some means or other, Tho'
only solution seems to be bonds,
and if this Is what the people
want they should make arrange
ments to call an election.
One of the most notlcablo feat
ures of the recent state fair in
Now Mexico was the surpriso ex
pressed by the people of di Heron t
sections of the state at the vari
ety, excellence and cheapness of
products of other sections. Nov
or before, It seemed, had thosuv
oral parts of tho state como so
olose together. Each section
had subsisted on its own pro
ducts and those imported from
oVuer states. As a result of this
new knowledge a state commor
oial body is forming, having for
its ohlof purposo the bringing
about of closer trado relations a
inong tho different parts of the
commonwealth.
Plant a Tree
Many of the citizens of Co
lumbus, arc netting out trees
this spring, T. A. Hulsey has
planted a large number of shade
trees already and others are
making preparations to plant
trees. A. G. Beck will plant an
orchard this spring on his place,
and many of the ranchers aro
setting out a few fruit treos.
We are of tho opinion that the
town board will devise some
means of furnishing water for
trees planted in town, and ad
vise that trees be planted in
front of the business houses
along the streets. The trees
planted last year and year be
fore in town have done very well
and more should be planted.
Thero is nothing that adds more
to the value of the property,
considering the cost.
Announce In The Courier.
It appears to us that you fel
lows who are figuring of run
ning for ofiico had better be get
tingyour names before the peo
ple, so that they may be taking
our number to be used in mak
ing up their ballot at tho prim
ary. A few nave already announ
ced and several are talking of
announcing soon. Why not get
n the car now and ride right on
to the primaries?. It wont cost
any more to announce now than
later, ahd us country editors
need the money awfully bad.
Come on boys and let's all get in
the race. The moro the mer
rier. If you want tho county
peoplo to vote for you, announce
n the country papers.
A Dinner Party
List Friday evening at 0:iiO
o'clock, the Sunday School of
the M. E. church tendered to the
retiring Superintendent, Mrs.
T. Dean a most delicious
dinner. Mesdamcs Stivison,
Elliott and English were the
caterers and proved themselves
worthy of tho trust reposed in
them. Covers wero laid for
twelve and there was not a vacant
seat. Prof. Stivison, at whose
cozy home tho dinner was served
presented tho compliments of
tho occasion to Mrs. Dean, and
in a very graceful mainer, pa d
glowing tribute to her exceeding
faithfulness during the two and
a half years of her work as sup
rientendent of the Columbus
Sunday School, Mrs. Deun re
plied brielly, but feelingly,
thanking him for his commenda
tlon and the board for its thought-
fulness. Thoso presont wero:
Mesdamcs Dean, Stivison,
Burkhead, Elliott, Boddington,
English, and Page; Misses Hester
Page, and Ritchie, and Messrs
Stivison, Boddington and Page
After tho dinner, tho board
held Its regular monthly bus!
ness meeting, and later discuss
ed methods by which thoy
might increase the attendance at
Sunday School.
The Pastor has been trying
very earnestly for the past mon
th to induce the men of the town
to como into the school, and it is
to be hoped ho will have abund
ant success. Schools and chur
ches build up a town more rapid
ly than any other factors, and we
cannot have successful schools
or churches unless they are well
attonded.
Chaplain Lutzof tho Thirteenth
Oavulry, occupied the pulpit at
tho M E. Church last Sunday.
Mr. Boddington was unable to
tilt tne appointment on account
of sickness.
Columbus on Chautaqua Circuit
Columbus is to have a regular
Chautaqua this summer. Mr.
Nowkirk, of the Pecos Valley
Newsf Artesia, New Mexico,
arrived hero Tuesday evening
and succeeded in interesting a
suflloicnb number of tho busi
ness men to guarantee that
Columbus will be placed on the
circuit this summer. The peo
ple of Columbus agree to buy
season tickets to the amount of
$250 before the opening, which
will be in Juno or July, and
furnish a hall and piano and also
take care of the local advertising.
There will be eleven people in
the program and some very un
usual attractlods will be offered
tho people of Columbus and
vicinity.
Suppressing The Fly
In the early spring, before the
eggs have been laid, is tho time
to start the crusade against our
old enemy the fly.
Begin this spring with a clean
up campaign in your locality.
Interest the boys' and. girls'
clubs, the agricultural and home
economics clubs, in the move
ment. Tho old saying, "An
ounco of prevention is worth a
pound of cure," surely holds
true In tho case of the liy. How
much safer and easier it is to
keep ilies out of our homes by
proper screening, trapping, and
destroying their breeding places,
than to get them out when they
are once in. Various methods
have been proponed to rid us of
these pests. The slogan of'Swat
the fly" has gone over the count
ry. Fly puper, some sticky and
some poisonous, unu various
sorts of fly poisons, are sold in
mrge quantities in our drug
stores. All these help some
what, bub the only rational and
and suro way is to prevent
breeding. Clean up. Do not
allow manure or filth of any sort
to stand around the yards or
stables. Keep all out houses In
clean and sanitary condition.
The garbage can is a breeding
place relished by the fly. Con
struct it so flies cannot gain
entrance.
Tho government spends ann
ually over one million dollars for
tho prevention of epidemics and
the betterment of the public
health. Lets help in the good
work by preventing the fly. Tho
citizen who fails to recognize his
responsibility toward health Is a
handicap to progress. Commun
ity action is necessary for a
successfully wuged warfare a
gainst the fly. Set a date for
clean up day this spring. Make
it early. Prevent the fly.
