S"filH.ll. FRANCIS. Island Pond, Vt.
Men's Christian Associations, and
this year the day will be observed
not only by the boys of the associa
tion, but also by the boys of the
c'uhs, Knights of King Arthur, Boy
Scouts and similar organizations.
Tne idea of the day is to select teams
of boys who go out with subscrip
tion papers and secure what money
they can for the work with boys.
Most of the money is secured in small
amounts, and they will try to see
everyone for a smr-dl sum. The
money will all be used for work
with boys, divided as follows: Fifty
per cent to the local organization;
thirty per cent to the state coin-
niiuee; twenty per cent to tne inter
national committee. The boys hope
for a cordial reception and a little
help from all.
Card of Thanks.
We wish in this way to extend our
since1 rest appreciation and heartfelt
thanks to each and everyone who in
any way assisted us in our tim? of
need and for the many kindly words
of sympathy to alleviate our sorrow
during our recent bereavement.
