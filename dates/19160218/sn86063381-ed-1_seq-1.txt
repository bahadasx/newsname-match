Visit Schools.
Yesterday the visiting teachers at
tended the Bemidji schools, gave new
ideas and received new ideas.
Last evening the convention was
formally called to order by R.
Ross of Walker, president of the as
sociation
Virginia Educator Talks.
Superintendent P. Colgrove of
Virginia was the first speaker on the
program. His subject was "The Ef
fective Teacher."
"The most effective teacher," said
Superintendent Colgrove," is one who
can make a lasting impression. What
is looked for in the teaching profes
sion is results, results in boys and
girls Most boys and girls are see
ing how little they can be driven to
do An effective teacher is one who
can make the student do the driving.".
Tesls of Experiences.
Superintendent Colgrove told of his
experiences in Virginia and of the
teachers and students he has met. He
advised the teachers not to stand
off and drive the children but that
they should mingle with the children
and become acquainted with them
Ambition Main Point.
"A teacher who impresses a stu
dent with some great ambition," said
Superintendent Colgrove, "is worth
infinitely more than the teacher who
just teaches arithmetic, geography,
etc If we want to turn out a boy
or girl whom the world will respect
we must in some way reach the will
o* the individual Don't let it worry
you what the boys or girls want to
be for the time being Don't hold
it up to the bov or girl that one job
is better than another The thing
that should worry the most is when
the boy or girl does not desire to
be anything
Must Inspire Student.
"Teachers must inspire the boy or
girl to stir up the desire to become
something The teacher who can do
that is an effective teacher
Dr Lotus Coffman, dean of the
college of education at the univer
sity, gave a talk on "The Three Pur
poses of the Public Schools
The three purposes of the public
schools are protection, education and
selection, according to Dr Coffman
Protection Necessary.
"Protection comes in the primary
grade," said Dr Coffman "The stu
dents then are noT able to take care
of themselves and must necessarily i
have protection Protection extends
through the entire schooling and is I
gradually extending Today we have
medical inspection in a great many
schools There are 450 cities in the

country whose schools have medical
inspectors. This is an increase of
430 cities since 1902.
"Open air schools are also another
form of protection. There are over
100,000 students in the public schools
at present who are doomed to die be
fore they reach the age of 18 years
on account of tuberculosis, unless
conditions are met and improved.
Educational machines must be recon
structed to meet the conditions
Must Feed Students.
"Other forms of protection," said
Dr Coffman, "are playgrounds, pro
vision for feeding the children, school
baths, etc There are 150 cities in
the country that must feed children
It is a condition which must be met.
"Another protection is the removal
of the broom and the feather duster
and the installing of modern systems
for cleaning the buildings Protec
tion must be given not only to pre
vent the students from bad physical
environment alone, but also bad so
cial and moral environment."
Education Fundamental.
Dr. Coffman pointed out that edu
cation comes during the secondary
period of schooling He stated that
education was fundamental to "pre
paredness." He described the differ
ent methods used during the second
ary period and stated the public
school system was primarily intellec
tual.
Selection, the third purpose of the
public schools, according to Dr. Coff
man, extends from one end of the
school work to the other.
Advertises Ability.
"The public school system is the
agent for the child to advertise what
ability he has," said Dr Coffman
"The school system gives the child
the idea of what he desires to be
come It should give him an ambi
tion
"Schools, to be educative, must
train workers and leaders

WRITES LETTER

Bemidji Man on Visit to Southern
1 State Tells of Minnesota
Celebration.
BEMIDJI RESIDENTS
ATTEND BIG MEETING
Describes Orange Groves and Gar
dens Summer Appears
Advanced.
A. A. Warfield of Bemidji who is
visiting in California, has written
an interesting letter to the Pioneer
in which he describes the Minnesota
celebration held Feb. 12, at which
a large number of Bemidji people
were present.
Kellogg Speaks.
Mr. War field's letter is as follows:
"Each year the visiting people at Los
Angeles have a picnic from their re
spective states. Feb. 12 was picnic
for all Minnesotans, which was held
at East Lake Park, a beautiful park
about three miles from Los Angeles.
About 3,000 people, all from Minne
sota, attended, each one bringing
their own lunch and by buying a but
ton for 10 'cents entitled you to a
cup of coffee. All were required to
register from their home county in a
b^ok nailed to a tree with posters
above each book stating the counties.
Each book contained people from 5
or 6 counties. Beltrami county head
ed the list from the northern part of
the state Nine were registered
from the city of Bemidji. After
lunch speeches were in order. Frank
Kellogg of St. Paul gave the open
ing address. After complimenting
the crowd for such a large represen
tation, he told a few good stories
and called to attention that this was
Lincoln's birthday. He ended up by
saying Minnesota and California were
good enough for him. Other speech
es followed and all were well re
ceived.
Good, Hot Day.
It was what you might call a good,
hot, comfortable day with plenty
shade trees and green grass. Made
me feel from Minnesota, their sum
mer was about three months ahead
of time
Since Jan. 31 there has been no
ram and sunshine every day. Gar
dening is in full swing plenty of
fresh vegetables already. The nights
are fogg\ and damp and I under
stand it will the same for a month
longer Lots of roses in bloom and
oranges looming up from the trees in
hundreds of back yards, besides
groves of many acres. It makes a
beautiful sight, looking east about
30 miles, where on a clear day can
be seen Old Baldy mountain, covered
with snow nearly the year around.
The railroad to San Diego will not
oe opened until about March 1 on
account of a big bridge being washed
out All travel goes by boat from
the beach The opening day for the
fair at San Diego will be March 18.
They are expecting a big attendance
on account of the war reverting
travel within the United States.
Thinking the letter may be of inter
est to you, I remain yours very truly,
A. A. WARFIELD.
We receive the Pioneer regularly
and enjoy it.

SCHMIDT,
HANSx
FORMER PRIEST,
IS ELECTROCUTED
Confessed Murderer of Girl Calmly
and Boldly Walks to His
Death.
ASKS FORGIVENESS
INTERRUPTS PEAYEE
Fall Mass Said in Death House
for First Time in
History.
Ossining, N. Y Feb. 18.Hans
Schmidt, the unfrocked priest con
victed of murdering his sweetheart,
Anna Aumueller, and throwing her
body in the Hudson river after dis
membering it, was electrocuted in
the death house of Sing Sing peni
tentiary here today.
Makes Death Statement.
He walked boldly ahead of his at
tendants, telling his fellow convicts
in the death house good bye as he
passed their cells. When he reached
the death chair he stopped, calmly
brushing aside the attendants who
were fastening the wires and holding
aloft a silver crucifix turned to the
spectators and said:
"Pardon me. I beg forgiveness of
all whom I have offended and scan
dalized. I forgive all who have of
fended me."
"My Lord and my God," inter
rupted Father Cashion, but the con
demned priest continued:
"Please give my mother my last
good wish."
Full Mass Said.
Again Father Cashin interrupted
with prayer. The condemned priest
repeated it, the straps were adjusted
and 1,880 volts were shot, instantly
killing the condemned man.
Father Cashin claimed the body
for burial in behalf of tCe mother
who is in Germany. A crucifix, two
candles and a cross were placed upon
an improvised altar in the death
house and full mass was said.
It is the first time that full mass
has been said in the history of the
death house.
Confesses to Murder.
Schmidt is the man who told his
attorney he wanted to die in the elec
tric chair in the hope that his inno
cence would afterward be established
and capital punishment thereby
would be stopped.
It was on Sept. 5, 1913, that the
upper part of Anna Aumueller's dis
membered body was found in the
river off Woodcliff, N. J.
The body was identified as that of
a former servant in the rectory of St
Boniface's church, and Schmidt, who
for three years had been performing
the functions of a priest in New
York, was arrested in the rectory of
St. Joseph's church.
On the day of his arrest the priest
made a full confession, in which he
admitted that he killed the girl and
cut her body into nine pieces
86,000 ACRES OF LAND
ADDED TO TAX LIST
Eighty-six thousand additional

taken hold of under the Volstead act.
John Wilcox, agent for the Over
land cars, left last evening for a
short stay in Minneapolis on busi
ness.

FORTY CENTS FEE MONTH
MUSTAGREE WITH
ALL POINTS IS
CLAIM OF U. S.
Secretary Lansing States That the
Attitude of Germany is
Inconsistent.
LUSITANIA CASE
AGAIN HELD UP
Teutons Demand That Great Britaia
Make Concession in Sub
marine War.
Washington, Feb. 18.The United
States in its submarine controversy
with Germany will accept nothing
short of a full and complete agree
ment covering all the points for
which it has contended as to assur
ances that the warfare in the future
will be conducted in accordance with
the established principles of interna
tional law.
In announcing that fact late yes
terday, Secretary Lansing let it be
known that the state department con
siders Germany's declaration of its
intention" to sink without warning
after February 29, all armed mer
chant vessels of the entente allies, to
be inconsistent with the assurances
given previously by the Berlin gov
ernment.
Hold Up Lusitania Case.
The tentative communication, de
signed to end the Lusitania case, still
in the possession of Secretary Lan
sing, will not be accepted formally
until such assurances regarding the
future are given, although the com
munication, insofar as it relates to
the Lusitania itself is acceptable.
State department officials also con
sider that the Austro-Hungarian
memorandum regarding armed ships
is not in accord with the assurances
given by the government in the nego
tiations over the sinking of the Ital
ian steamship Ancona.
Ancona Matter Also Held.
Consequently final settlement of
the Ancona case probably will be
withheld until Austria gives similar
assurances to those now requested
from Germany.
The views of the United States were
explained in detail today by Secre
tary Lansing to Count Von Bernstorff,
the German ambassador. The am
bassador was informed, it was indi
cated at the state department, that
the United States desires the German
declaration regarding armed mer
chant ships to be modified
Britain Must Make Concession.
Today it was stated emphatically
in Teutonic diplomatic circles that
the Berlin foreign office would not
modify the declaration of their in
tention to sink armed ships, or in
form the United States the previous
assurances still were binding unless
Great Britain should give assurances
of some kind that a submarine which
warns a British steamship, armed
ostensibly for defensive purposes,
-would not be fired upon
