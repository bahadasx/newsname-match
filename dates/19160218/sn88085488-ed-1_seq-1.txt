•
The mooted case of Albert 11. !
Laney versus David M. Haynes, in !
which .Mr. Laney seeks to recover
$25,000 for alleged alienation of the
affections of his former wife, is now
being heard in the superior court
and much interest is being taken in
the proceedings by Pullman peo
ple, as all the parties interested in
the suit are known here.
The case went to the jury at noon
Thursday, and up to the time of go
ing to press the jurors were still
deliberating.
Anent the case the Colfax Pa
lcuser of Wednesday has the follow
ing to say:
For the past two days the court
room has been crowded with inter
ested spectators, the case having at
tracted widespread attention by rea
son of the fact that the same action
was tried before the superior court
two years ago and was continued
when the jury failed to agree.
Shortly prior to this action it is
understood that the defendant se
cured legal separation from his wife,
and last, year Mrs. Laney brought
action to secure a divorce from her
husband. The latter fought the case
and, while a divorce was granted, he
was given the custody of the minor
children, of which there are four.
Several months later Haynes and
Mrs. Laney were married.
A mild sensation was caused yes
terday when it was shown on the
witness stand that, the Peddicord ho
tel register of Spokane and two
pages from the register of a hotel at
The Dalles. Ore., entered as exhibits
in the former trial, had disappeared.
it appears that the jury in the form
er trial was dismissed on a Sunday
morning by .lodge Jackson of Col
ville, before whom the case was
tried, and that the foreman of
the jury turned over the exhibits in
the case to Bailiff Brown. Contrary
to tho usual custom. County Clerk
B. F. Manring was not called when
the Jury was dismissed, consequent
ly it was not possible to place the
exhibits in the vault in the clerk's
office, and Mr. Brown placed them
in the judge's desk. On the follow
ing Monday morning, when the ex
hibits were turned Over to Clerk
Manring, the latter noticed that the
Peddicord register was gone. He
did not notice the absence of the two
Pages In the other register until

PULLMAN. WASHINGTON. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1916
Survey Board Drops Dr. Claxton
j Will Investigate (educational System
i •l State Without Help of U. S.
llureaii of Education
At a meeting of the Washington
educational survey commission held
last week, a' .Seattle, at which all
members save one were present, it
was decided to sever all connection
With the United States bureau of
education and conduct the survey of
the stale Institutions independently.
The action comes, say members of
the commission, as a result of the
slowness of the United States bureau
to act, and also because the state
commission was not in favor of the
advisors and investigators selected
;by Dr. P. P. Claxton bead of the
federal bureau.
The survey commission was ap
pointed as the result ol a bill passed
by the state legislature, on the.
recommendation of Dr. Claxton. The
' purpose of the commission is to
; make a thorough investigation of the
state institutions in order to see
whether there are needless duplica
tions of courses, and also to find out
what changes, if any, would serve to
] increase the efficiency of the schools.
| The understanding was that the
United States bureau of education
would name a number of leading
educational experts of the country,
and out of that number the state
commission was to select three, who
were to outline their ideas of the
scope and funcaions of the ideal state
university, state college and normal
I school. Dr. Claxton was asked to
send Dr. S. P. Capen, specialist in
higher education, to collect the- data.
Victor Zednick, a member of the
commission, explained its action as
follows:
"The commission and the heads
of the institution of higher learning
| of the state have been in conference
on special phases of the- educational
survey. We have been in tele
graphic communication with the
j United States commissioner of edu
cation and other prominent educa
tors of national reputation.
"Further work of the commission
will not be carried on under the su
pervision of the United States bureau
of education. Dr. S. P. Capen, spe
cialist in higher education, of the
bureau, will not assemble the- data
concerning the higher institutions of
learning, nor will Dr. P. P. Claxton,
United States commissioner of edu
cation, be engaged in any part of the
work. For this work, together with
the gathering of facts concerning the
common and secondary schools, and
for all other co-operation, the com
mission will name independent ex
perts of note, and the active survey
will begin us soon as the experts can
get to this state.
"There are several reasons for this
decision. At the last meeting of the
commission, December 18 and 19,
it was decided to call to Washington
Music Lovers Awaiting Lecture
Lecture-Muslcale on Friday Evening
Arouses Interest among Many
Music Lovers
Music lovers of Pullman are
manifesting growing Interest in the
lecture-musicale to be given in the
auditorium Friday evening, Febru
ary 18. by Dr. Alma Webster Powell.
Dr. Powell is at the head of a
school of music in Brooklyn, N. V.,
where, for 15 years she has been con
ducting experiments to show the ef
fects of music upon people of differ
ent classes, different nationalities
and ages. As a grand opera singer
she appeared with Caruso. She was
a leading court singer in Berlin,
where she was followed by Geraldine
Farrar.
Dr. Powell has lived abroad for
several years and now sings and
speaks in eight different lan
guages. Besides having been In
Germany, Italy and France, she
has made three trips across Russia,
singing in grand opera roles. She Is
a very Interesting woman. Her
wealth is being devoted to impress
upon the public the need for music
in human affairs. After " writing a
"' -111 advisory capacity President A.
Ross Hill of ihe University of .Mis
souri; President Pearson of the lowa
Stale College, and President Henry
H. Seoriej of tbe Cedar Fails normal
school of lowa. Dr. Claxton was
notified of his decision and empow
ered, provided these could not act,
to select any other three men agree
able to the presidents of the univer
sity and state college and the prin
cipals of the normal schools. These
men were nol to make a detailed sur
vey of local conditions, but rather
to appear before the commission and
outline the scope and functions of
an ideal university, state college and
normal school. Dr. Claxton was
asked to send Dr. Capen to assemble
the facts.
"This letter was sent December IS
and no answer received until Janu
ary 25, although Dr. Claxton prom
ised to have Dr. Capen on the ground
not later than January 15. When ho
did answer it was to state that Dr.
Capen could not begin his work here
until February 20, and would be as
sisted by Dr. Hill, president of the
University of Missouri. He further
declared the bureau could give no
assistance tor the common school
work until next fall. The law re
quires that the report shall be made
and presented to the governor not
later than April 30.
The commission opposed Dr.
Hill, and Dr. Claxton replied Dr. Ca
pen would not do the work without
him. The commission believed Dr.
Hill thoroughly competent and ab
solutely fair, but did not feel it de
sirable, to have this work done by
one of the three determined upon
under a tri-party agreement. In
view of the fact that Dr. Claxton was
resolute in his determination to have
Dr. Dill, and could not make the
common school survey in time, the
commission, being determined to
give tin! public school question dee
consideration, was forced to discon
tinue negotiations ami look for ex
perts elsewhere.
"The commission is in communi
cation with Dr. E. P. lubberly, of
Columbia university, who is an ex
pert in common school administra
tion and investigation. it is hoped
he will guide the survey work in con
nection with the public school prob
lem. We are also in communication
with Dr. Chas. 11. .luelil of Chicago,
Commissioner David Sneddon of
Massachusetts; Chancellor Edward
C. Eliott of Montana, and W. C. Bag
ley of the University of Illinois, to
assist the members In securing all
of the necessary information relative
to all of tho state institutions of
higher education.
"It is the desire of the commission
to have a complete examination made
appertaining to our educational sys
tem, both common schools and In
stitutions of higher learning, and we
are using every means to start the
work at once."
thesis on the subject, "Music is a
Human Need," she received her doc
tor's degree from Columbia univers
ity. Her appearance here will in
clude a lecture on the necessity of
music in human affairs, followed by
a program of vocal selections.

NUMBER 18
HOLLANDiiHONOREO
AT U. OF W. BANQUET
Several Speakers Predict Harmonious
Relations Between Two Rig Edu
cational Institutions in
Future
President D, O. Holland and his
sister, Mrs. Gifford, returned Sun
day from Seattle, where they attend
ed a banquet given by members of
tho faculty of the U. of W. They
and President and Mrs. Suzzallo
were the guests Of honor. Accord
ing to reports published in the Se
attle papers, the banquet resolved it
belf Into a sort of love feast at which
the two presidents burled tho toma
hawk, which has hitherto been much
in evidence in the relations existing
between the University and State
College. Judging by the published
reports of his address President Hol
land did not commit himself further
than to express the sincere hope that
the- two institutions may work in
harmony and that both may be able
to look over the Cascade mountains
and realize that they belong to the
whole state and not to western and
eastern Washington respectively.
President Suzzallo was more pro
fuse in his predictions of harmony
and the substitution of co-operation
for Individualism and provincialism,
which, he asserted, had been respon
sible for the past rivalry between
the two institutions.
During the evening, Erastus Bral
nard, formerly editor of the Post-
Intelligencer, presented a handsome
bronze paperweight to President
Holland, a duplicate of one already
given to President Suzzallo. The
keynote struck in all the speeches
was confidence that the long per
sonal friendship between the new
presidents will result in harmonizing
all differences between the Univers
ity and State College.
