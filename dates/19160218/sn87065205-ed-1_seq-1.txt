STOIi PROGRESSIVE LEAGUE
HMD LAST MOflDJIY HIT.
A. GREATER HOUSTON, now five days young, was
born Inst Monday evening in the Court House. All the
fathers are doing well and it is a certain fact that they
will make this young hummer grow and prosper in the ad
monition of the Lord. The little man is robust, radiant
and rustling addition to the progressive family and he will
be dressed and fed with all that goes to make Houston a
bigger, better and greater town. Progress will be his pro
fession and his education will be advanced by a new
school building, his bodily health attended to by a better
sewer system, his religious life made happy by a general
get together of Sunday Schools and churches, his pleas
ures of transportation made easier by better rords and bis
habits formed by boosting, lushing, pulling and helping
Houston hump, hustle and hum. He will fight and lick
any kicker, knocker, gloomer or groucher. He will oust
old Hard Times into the tall and uncut and will establish
workers to GET BUSY-NESS or bust. He has a vision of
better days a vision of less gossip and scandal a vision
of community cooperation that will make business and so
cial life blossom and bloom like the rippling breezes of
eternal summertime. He is here to stay to WORK TO
HELP THE OTHER FELLOW!
' The genial and progressive proprietor of the Houston
Hotel, the distinguished old time Southern Gentleman, A.
J. Dorman, said bring a smoking appetite along and the
professional and business men of the town brought it. As
u was the birth of A. GREATER HOUSTON, the guests
will never forget the evening, for then, really and t uly,
i he town was born anew. It was rejuvenated-it was
born again it received the spirit of GET TOGETHER
and was baptized in the curly ringed smoke of the pleas
ant Havaiinas that tilted the GET BUSY si UP and
AT IT-DO AND DARE IT-HUMP AND HUSTLE,
WE'RE ON THE JOB!!!
About. 75 jjicn were present and it was evident from
t e talks given by A. J. Dorman, Dr. E. P. Wilson, Dr.
l ox, Jeff Busby and R. S. Mil -hell that PROGRESS must
prevail in Houston and Chickasaw County. It was a
meeting of men to DO THINGS for they knew the time had
cdiiie to entertain OPPORTUNITY and its running mate
PROSPERITY. They knew that they MUST woo and win
ihese pals that are hunting for a home and they BELIEVE
HOUSTON IS' THE PLACE. They knew something had
to be. done they knew old selfishness had to be banished
from the laud and they knew that by concerted action the
town of Houston could prosper as other urojressive towns.
it was a meeting that means much for Houston and The
Hummer is happy that at last the business men have come
together to BOOST-TOOT'EM UP and GET ON THE JOB!
All the talks were in keeping with the idea set forth
by Bolster Dorman, go d roads, more school facilities, bet
ter farming, better sewerage system, better community
get fogetlier and a general upbuilding of Houston and
Chickasaw. Wit and windom fell i.ito hearts ready to
pump the well of prosperity, and the general flow of good
spirits, human and not liquid, made the BOOSTERS feel
that they could handle the situation and keep the well
from, going dry. They want this well to burst forth into
artesian sprays and to let it sprinkle PROSPERITY on
everybody in the town and county. Boiling it down, they
mean to PREPARE and P-R-E-P-A-R-E-D MM!
Ashes that held on for an inch or more were flecked
nssunder by the nappy fingers of the BOOSTING BAND
and sulphuric bursts of blue tip.ied wood fired the little
submarines into action and a little more light on the sub
ject at hand. So from the curls of mingled smoke that
blended the good followship
(.LI lUbtlMLK the nomination for officers joyfully filter
- I'd thru aad the result progressively reads like this: A. J.
Dorman, President, Dr. L. T. Fox, Vice President. , Walter
Alexander, Jeff Busby, J. E. Ford, J. E. Hill aad Rush H.
Knox were chosen Directors. A secretary will be secured
to look after the boosting in the proper way and tell the
v..,rhi that Houston CAN DELIVER THE GOODS!
To the Voters of Chickasaw County: -
I take this method of thanking each of you for the
support you gave n;e in the First Primary Election held
February lOih, for the offu e of Circuit Clerk, there is no
one that appreciates this mark of .-onfidence more than I
do. I feel that the vote given me was truly a very com
plimentary one, and I certainly appreciate it. To those
who saw fit to vote again ;t me, I have nothing but the
kindest of feeling.
Very ratei'ufully,
and the friendly feeling of
Again thanking you, I be to remain,
JNO. CLIFTON WILLIAMS.'
