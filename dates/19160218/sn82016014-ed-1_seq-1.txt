EXECUTED
TODAY AT

Meets Death Like a Stoic, Ask
ing Forgiveness.
Last Word Is Good-Bye to,
"Dear Old Mother."
DEAD WITHIN A MINUTE
Spent Part of Night With Priest
In Prayer.
Electrocuted for Murder
Anna Aumuelier.
of
Ossining, Feb. 18. Striding
boldly ahead of his attendants,
but stopping abruptly on the
brink of death to express his last
good wishes to his mother, Hans
Schmidt, the unfrocked New
York priest was shocked to
death in the electric chair at
Sing Sing at dawn today.
Seldom have more dramatic
scenes been witnessed in the fa
mous death chamber than that
presented as Schmidt stood be
fore the chair, an ebony and sil
ver crucifix held before him, ad
dressing the witnesses of his ex
ecution in a last farewell to his
mother.
Last Wishes.
"Please give my mother my last
good wishes. It is for her," were the
condemned man's last words, except
for the repetition of a prayer a the
deadly electrodes were adjusted-.
The dying statement of Schmidt,
made from directly in front of the
chair, was entirely unexpected. He
was going to his death for having
killed Anna Aumuelier, cutting her
body to pieces and casting it into the
Kast river.
Denies Murder Charge.
Through his attorneys he had is
sued a statement last night denying
that he had killed the Aumuelier girl
and asserting that she died from the
effects of an illegal operation.
Scarcely had the seventeen wit
nesses seated themselves when Keep
er Fred Dorner stepped through the
little green door and strode to where
Schmidt, crucifix in hand, jaw set.
walked beside his spiritual aid. Father
C'ashin.
Mingled with Father Ca shin's slow, j
deep toned prayer were the loud cries
of -4-ichmidt to the other condemned
men.
"Goodbye, goodbye. One and all,
goodbye," he called.
"And goodbye especially to Wat-
son."
Watson is doomed to die next for
wife murder.
Scattered replies came from the
hidden condemned men: "Goodbye,
goodbye, Schmidt, goodbye."
Hurried to Ienth Chair.
Schmidt was calm and collected as
he walked to the chair shouting good
bye to twenty other condemned men
in the death house. Father Cashin,
the prison chaplain, the sruards and
Keeper Dorney, who directed the exe
cution, were astounded at Schmidt's
hurried movements and disregard for
the measured pace of the death
march, when he suddenly turned as
the rubber mat in front of the chair
was reached.
With the long ebony and sirver
crucifix held aloft before him,
Schmidt swept aside the reaching
arms of waiting guards and rasped
sharply:
"One minute, please, one minute
until I say my say."
The guards, at first mistaking
Schmidt's action for a struggle
against seating himself for death,
stepped back in surprise at the sound
of the condemned man's voice.
Ignoring them, Schmidt addressed
the men sitting on the witness
benches restless with expectancy.
Ho Forgives All.
"Pardon me," he said. "I ask the
forgiveness of all whom I have of
fended and of all who I have scandal
ized. I forgive all- who offended
against me."
"My Lord and my God, I must '
interrupted Father Cashin in an ad
monishing tone, but Schmidt, repeat
ing the words hurriedly after the
priest, hastened on with his dying
statement :
"My last thought is for my mother,"
rang his voice, sharp and clear against
the silence of the little room.
"Please give my mother my last
good wishes. It is for her. I "
"My Lord and my God," again in
terrupted Father Ca hin. Schmidt
then began quietly repeating the pray
er, pat down at the conclusion and
died without uttering another sound.
Within a minutes he was dead. He
had spent the night up to midnight
in praying and talking with Father
C'ashin and sIPt 'fj001 midnight to 6

'If You Don't Like It What
Will You Do About It?"
Sheriff Then Informed Her of
the Waiting Warrant.
I. ate this afternoon Hazel Gard
ner, the 17-year-old girl who ran
away from home, masquerading
as a man, was released on iier own
recognizance.
Complaint charging Hazel Gardner,
the 17-year-old girl who ran away
from her home in Topeka in company
with Pearl Higginbottom, age 13. last
Tuesday and was found at Grove
Thursday dressed in boy's clothes,
with inducing the Higginbottom girl
to run away with her for immoral pur
poses, has been filed in the court of
Topeka. The complaint is sworn to
by Sheriff L. L. Kiene. When found
the Higginbottom girl wag also dressed
as a boy. Miss Gardner is 17 years
old and was a student at Dougherty's
Business college.
She isunder the care of the matron
at the jail. Pearl is still at the de
tention home. The two girls were
brought back to Topeka late Thursday
evening by Hugh Larimer, undersher
iff, following their apprehension at
Grove.
The Gardner girl. Sheriff Kiene says,
does not look to be as old as she is.
During a conversation Thursday even
ing, the sheriff in an effort to be pleas
ant remarked to Miss Gardner that she
did not appear to be seventeen years
old.
"Well, I am," she returned. "And if
you don't like it, what are you going
to do about it?" (
Sheriff Kiene then informed the
girl that the warrant would be issued.
The girl said nothing.
Their Stories Conflict.
Stories told by the two girls as to
who was responsible for the escapade
conflict. Pearl, the 13-year-old girl,
according to officials, says Miss Gard
ner was responsible, in the matron s
ward at the county jail the Gardner
girl claims that the Higginbottom girl
was responsible. She claimed to Mrs.
Abbott that Pearl induced her to start
out. She also told Mrs. Abbott that
she wasn't satisfied with things at her
home. ,
Both girls tell an exciting story of
their experiences. Miss Gardner claims
that they were without anything to
eat for two days. At nights they made
their beds in ptraw stacks and claim"
that they were pursued by coyotes,
despite the fact that coyotes are the
moat timid of prairie animals so far
as their relation to human being is
concerned.
At the detention home. Miss Higgin
bottom is the picture of despair. The
other girl, officials say, does not pro
fess to be so sorry about it.
County officials in issuing the com
plaint for Miss Gardner accuse her of
inducing the younger girl to run away
for immoral purposes.

PETITIONS FOR
NEW AUDITORIUM
OUT NEXT WEEK
Special Election to Remodel
Building Will Be Asked.
President Webb of Commercial
Club Pushes Move.
GIVE EVERY ONE THEIR VIEW
'Explanatory Campaign"
Give People All Facts.
to
Commissioners To Be Governed
by Desires of Voter.
Special election petitions for a $75.
000 bond issue for a remodeled audi
torium will be circulated in Topeka
next week, according to an announce
ment made this noon by W. W. Webb,
president of the Commercial club.
While no official call has been mads
upon the city commissioners, Mr.
Webb has ascertained that the com
missioners will be governed by the de
sires of the people and action in call
ing a boffid election will certainly bt
taken if the 25 per cent of the voters
who turned out at the last election
sign the petitions.
"So we will go right ahead with our
petitions," said Mr. Webb today, "and
it is probable the commissioners will
not be asked to take any action offi
cial or unofficial, until we present
them with the petitions. The com
mittee which will have direct charge
of the campaign comprises S. E. Cobb.
J. S. Dean, Carroll Merriam, J. Will
Kelley and myself."
Explanatory Campaign.
At the same time the petitions are
beirg circulated an educational, or
explanatory, campaign will be carried
on throughout the city. The first gun
in this campaign will he fired Mon
day noon at the regular meeting of
President Webb's "Clearing House of
Ideas." At that time Commissioner
Wasson will explain to the Commer
cial club the exact financial status of
Topeka and the condition she will
find herseli in should the small Dona
issue carry.
Speakers, on request, will be sent
to a meeting of any organization, any
place or any time, to explain the Audi
torium project. J. C. Holland, the
architect, hits expressed a willingness
to explain his plans at any time.
"While -it Is probable we will hear
little opposition to this plan," said
Mr. Webb today, "we wish to give
every organization, social, political or
labor, an opportunity to express itself
and listen to our plan. In all fair
ness I btlieve any organization that
might be opposed should give us a
hearing before taking any concerted
action against it."
To Seat 6,000.
It is pointed out by the leading busi
ness men of Topeka who have dis
cussed the auditorium proposition
from every angle that in accepting
Mr. Holland's plan, Topeka is getting
a 6.000 capacity auditoriuhm, just as
good from an acoustic or fireproof
standpoint, as could be obtained with
a $200,000 bond issue for a new audi
torium. Nor should the people forget
that at the same time they are going
to acquire a new banquet hall, kitch
en, equipment and the like as large as
that at the Masonic temple.

A HANGING IN KANSAS
State Anti-Oeath Penalty Law Not Ap
ply in Prison Murder Case.
Leavenworth, Kan., Feb. 18. If the
United States government convicts J.
S Jones, a convict serving a term in
the federal prison here of killing
Henry Schmidt, another prisoner,
Kansas will see its first legal hanging
in its history as a state. Jones will
be arraigned on a murder charge be
fore a United States commissioner
next Thursday. Heattacked and stabbed
Schmidt because the latter had spilled
saU on bread Jones was eating.
The crime was committed on gov
ernment land and the federal statute
provides hanging and no other penalty
for such cases. If Jones is convicted
ths federal judge before whom he is
tried will have no alternative but to
sentence him to hang. Such a sen
tence would be carried out at the
penitentiary by the United States mar
shal's ofiices.
The case recalls the fact that there
never has been a hanging under state
law in Kansas.

of them went over. After two hours
