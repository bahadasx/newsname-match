we thought that February 2nd

makes any difference which day
the ground hog celebrates, but we
would very much like to have-this
matter settled. Let Jim Maret
settkMhe question. t We failed to
have a letter frehr this-point last
week, but the reason - was- the
writer and better half were in
Cincinnati and did not get back
in time to write one. We will
atone for this by telling all we
know this week. Old Uncle
Johnie McDaniels, living near
Livingston, died Monday. He

his life in this county, and had

one of the best, as well as the
most successful in business, and
had accumulated quite a fortune,
and even at the time of his death
owned 3000 acres of land, some of
which is the most valuable in the
county, and a few years ago was
considered the wealthiest citizen
in the county. In the past few
years he was less active in busi

ed his efforts as formerly. He is
survived by three sons, Tilden,

Ohio have called ray attention to
Section 4,954 of the General Code
of Ohio, as amended in lgl4 with
regards to primary elections, and
have requested that 1 indicate my
willingness to have my nameused
"I accordingly take the liberty
of sending you the enclosed letter
as formal permission under the
statute."
TEXT OF LETTER "
The letter the President inclos
ed was as follows:
"While I am entirely unwilling
to enter into any contest for the
presidential nomination of the
Democratic party, I am willing to
permit the use of my name that
the Democrats in Ohio may ,make
known their preference in regard
to that nomination.
"In order, therefore, to satisfy
the technical requirements of the
statutes of the State of Ohio I
consent to the use of my name as
a candidate for the presidency by
any candidate who seeks to be
elected a delegate to the national
Democratic convention which is to
assemble in June next."
This was the first time the Pres
ident has consented formally to
have his name used in connection
with the nomination. His name
has been placed on primary bal
lots in several states, however
through the activities of friends.
The President takes thejposition
that the voters will have to deter
mine whether he will make the
race for the Presidency in I9IG
as the Democratic candidate. In
a letter written to A Mitchell
Palmer, then a Representative
from Pennsylvania, before his in
auguration, Mr. Wilson made it
plain that Ue would only be a can
didate again it the Democratic vo
ters desired it.

To kilLthe nerve pains of sciat

Sloan's Lineament. It penetrates
to the seat of pain and brings
ease as soon as it is applied. A
grrafc comfort too with Sloan's
is that no rubbing is required.
Sloan's Lineament is invaluable
for stopping muscular or nerve
pain of ony kind. Try it at once
if you suffer with rheumatism,
lumbago, sore throat, pains in
chest, sprains, bruises, etc. It is
excellent for neuralgia aud head
ache. 25c at all druggists.
Washington, Feb. 14. Presi
dent Wilson to-day formally gave
his consent that his name be used

1 contest for the nomination, but
