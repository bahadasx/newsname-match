NEW LAW

Labor Yields to Inevitable
UNION REGULATIONS
THROWN OVERBOARD
Sacrifice Ideal for Sake ot Victory; Pack

By ED L. KEEN.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
NEW YORK, Feb. 18. It would be
'ho greatest possible mistake for any
one to assume that the recent wrangle
in England ever the question of con
scription indicated a lack of interest
on the part ot the antls in the success
t j 1 prosecution of the war.
The whole row might It ; a been pre
vented had tiie government i;een fit to
lake the British people into its con
fidence and show them in detail just
why a modified form of conscription
was necessary. But there were mili
tary reasons, so it was said, why such
a course was inadvisable.
Rather than impart any possible use
ful information to the enemy, the Brit
ish administration actually prepared
to run the risk of itself being over
turned. So there was an awful squabble, and
for a time it seemed as of the gov
ernment would surely collapse. The
I anti-coilscriptionists finally yielded,
but without surrendering their prin
ples. Having once become convinced that
seme degree of compulsory military
service was necessary in order to win
the war, they promptly put their prin
ciples on the shelf.
Wherefore there Is presented the
amazing spectacle of what is now a
conscriptfonist cabinet containing
among Its ablest and most conscien
tious members three men who had' al
ways been fundamentally opposed to
conscription In any form.
Organized labor, although as a mat
ter of principle still arguing against
compulsion, has acecpted the, inevita
ble. But more than that the leaders
have entered Into a solemn compact
with Premier Asquith whereby the or
dinary trade union regulation have
been thrown overboard for the period
of the war so that women and un
skilled laborers may perform certain
tasks hitherto allotted only to skilled
workmen, thus releasing the latter for
the more difficult and technical jobs
in the munitions industry.
There will be no anti-conscription
riots in England. It is one of the
Britisher's peculiar traits that he does
his revolutiug before an unpopular law
goes on the statute books. Thereafter
he always submits, although sometimes
I wilh a wry face,
! It was so in that case ot Lloyd
George's national insurance scheme,
and more recently when under the
defense of the realm act public drink
ing hoursl were cut from 18 to 5 Ms a
day and treating was prohibited.
True, the bill as finally pased pro
vided for only a sort of sugarcoated
conscription. A lot of exempt ions were
arranged, so that the law yill actual
ly bring into the army only about half
a million additional men; but the b!g
outstanding fact is that the anti-con-scriptionists
temporarily sacrificed one
ideal fo rthe sake of one they believed
to be a greater Victory for the allies.
H was the finest demonstration yet
afforded of the present fighting spirit
cf England.
