Swanze
Pest of
Teutons
By Mary Boyle O'Reilly
LONDON' Feb. 18.—There Is
a certain kind of joking In Bel
gium called SWANZE.
It Is neither humor nor wit but
a kind of mockery which is in
tended to rankle.
Since the occupation of Bel
gium by the Germans, swanae
has become almost entirely con
fined to the children, but they
have not fallen short of the ;ie
<•iili.ii' national standard which
was established ages ago.
I'rchliis Lenin How.
When motor car tooting was
limited by special decree to Ger
man military machines, with pre
scribed modulations of toots,
every street arab in Brussels in
atantly commandeered a horn,
whistle or trumpet.
This instrument of torture he
carried at considerable risk in
der a torn shirt or within his
woeful trousers. And the In
stant a German officer ventured
into the street regulation "toots"
followed him in taunting itera
tion.
Can't Pennlige It.
Probably the most irritating
awanze was Invented by. little
boys who, making a hole in the
middle of their caps and sticking
carrots "plcklehaub" - wise
through the crowns, would se
riously execute the goose step
until a leader ordered "Quick
march to Paris" when the ras
cals would walk backwards!
That performance was hard to
atop for the German military
governor could fix no penalty
upon children for putting carrots
on their heads.

Child's
Scream
With his leg badly crushed by
the heavy wheels of a lumbsr
truck, which ran over him, Ern
est Alvera, three years old, lay
screaming in the street while the
driver of the truck stepped on
the accelerator and speeded down
the street at 10 o'clock this
morning.
R. E. Bailey, a roomer at 1001
South J street, heard the little
boy's screams and dashed out of
the house in time to see the huge ;
machine speeding down J strest.
Mrs. Agnes Alvera, the boy's
mother, picked up the little body
while Bailey summoned a physi
cian. At a late hour today phy
sicians thought they would be
able to save the boy's leg.
Had Gone to Play.
The child had just run out of
the house to play, according to
Bailey.
"No one except some small
children saw the accident," he
said, "but it ia impossible the
driver did not know he had run
over the youngster, because his
screams could be heard in the.
house."
The truck was one of the large,

driver and the number are un
known. Police officers are mak
ing every effort to locate the
man.

Schthidt was the unfrocked
priest convicted of murdering his
sweeilicin i. Anna Aumueller; and
-throwfoty her body In the Hudson
after dismembering it.
He told his attorney he wanted
to die tv the electric chair in the
hope that his Innocence would
afterward be established and
capital punishment thereby
would be stopped.
Body of Servant.
It iwas on Sept. 5, 1913, that
the upper part of Anna Aumuel
ler'* dismembered body was
found In the river off Woodcl'.ff,
N.M. .
The body was identified aa
that of a former servant In the
rectory ef St. Boniface's church,
and Schmidt who for three years
had been performing the func
tions of a priest In New York,
waa arrested.
On tlie day of his arrest the
prleft made a full confession, in
whl_.li he admitted that he killed
the girl and cut her body Into
nine pieces.
His statements on that ivch
slon were as startling that his
sanity . was questioned, and >>x

they pronounced him aane and
shamming Insanity.

At fhe first trial two of the
Jurors held that he was insane

he had been shamming insanity

He then proceeded to tell Mr.

HUH Another Version.
Schmidt's contradictions final

affidavit which he made on Oct
30, i in., and which was used as
the basis for a motion for a new
trial.
This was to the effect that a
