KILLED ANNA AUML'LLER
Ends Career of Crime of Which
Sordid Infatuation For Girl
Was Climax
Ry Associated Press
Ossining, N. V., Feb. 18. Hans
Schmidt was electrocuted at Sing Sing
Prison to-day tor the murder of Anna
Aumuiler, September 2, 1913.
Schmidt went quietly to the death
chamber, accompanied by the princi
pal keeper and the Rev. Father Cashin,
the prison chaplain. Leaving the
death house he said good-by to those
who remained.
When he entered the chamber the
guards attempted to direct him toward
the chair, but Schmidt gently shook
them off and insisted upon addressing
Ihe seventeen witnesses. The guards
desisted from their efforts and with
Father Cashin standing at one side and
the keeper at the other Schmidt said:
Seats Himsetf in Chair
"Gentlemen: 1 ask forgiveness of all
those I have Injured or scandalized. I
forgive all who have injured me. My
last wish is to say good-by to my dear
old mother."
Schmidt then seated himself in the
electric chair and the current was
applied three times. Within a minute
he was dead, lie had spent the night
up to midnight in praying and talking
With Father Cashin and slept from
midnight to 3 o'clock, when he was
awakened for breakfast. He would
take only a cup of coffee.
When the torso of Anna Aumuller's
body was washed up on the New
Jersey shore of the Hudson river there
started a search which has had few
parallels in the annals of New York
crime. There was but one faint clue,
a pillow slip, on which was embroid
ered the letter "A," hilt it was just
such a pillow slip as might be found in
hundreds of homes or siores. There
was not even a laundry mark to aid
the police.
Arrests Priest
With this slender clew Inspector
Faurot took personal charge of the
rase and on September 14, 1913. twelve I
days after the murder, Hans Schmidt, ;
an assistant priest at an uptown
■ •hureh, was arrested, charged with the I
crime. An hour before the arrest .then
inspector had broken into a flat and
found a long-bladed butcher's knife
and other evidence that the murder
had been committed there. Schmidt'
confessed and his sole defense was
that it was a "blood sacrifice murder."
The body had been dismembered and
presumably all of it was thrown into
the river, although the head was never
found. Schmidt was twice placed on
trial, the first Jury, in December, 1913,
falling to reach a verdict. In Feb
ruary, 1914, he was found guilty.
Sordid Story
Resides the sordid story of Anna
Aumuller's infatuation for Schmidt,
the trials revealed that his was a ca
rper of crime. He was engaged in a
counterfeiting scheme at the time the
murder was committed, it developed,
and "Dr." A. Muret. who posed as a
dentist, was sent to prison for seven
'ears as Schmidt's accomplice in the
la tier's scheme. It was found that
Schmidt also had posed as a physician,
that he had committed forgery on nu
merous occasions, and that he had
been guiltv of various other acts of
fraud. His attorneys pleaded their
client was insane. The slayer, how
ever, always contended that he was
sane. He took no active part in his
own defense. When he was sentenced
he.thanked .the court and expressed a
desire to he excuted at once. He main
tained the same stolid composure
through all the various stages of his
case.

SARI PETRASS
Sari Petrass, the beautiful Hungarian actress, has been shot in Budapest
as a British spy. according to cable dispatches received by residents of Cleve
land who knew her.
Allss Petrass was put to death, the dispatches said, almost immediately
after the court-martial found her guilty of luring military secrets from high
army officials and communicating them to the British War Office by means
of smuggled letters.
i'ntil she was executed the public was unaware that Miss Petrass was
even a prisoner, and the official announcement of the execution was a na
tional shock. Miss Petrass was not only a regning favorite of the Hungarian
theatergoers, but of a family of famous Hungarian patriots.
When war was declared the actress was starring in "The Marriage Mar
ket," a Hungarian operetta, at Daly's Theater in London. She immediately
returned to Budapest, but instead of continuing on the stage began an elabo
rate round of social activities.
