Fiction will be had. The old plan
of the Btoolplgeon work was to
pretend to be sick, or if not sick
himself some member of his
family was, and in this way he
would get the sympathy of the
doctor or druggist, get the whis
key, and then he would have
them pulled. What is meaner
or more despicable, than such
actions? You could hot see such
a man's soul with a spy glass it
would be so little. This kind of
work will cost the county not
less than $1200 or $1500. I
don't see why the county officers
could not handle this kind of
business, and save the people
that much money. The lawmay
be bad, and the District Attor
ney should be reasonably cer
taln of getting a conviction be
fore bringing the case. The
open Beason for stool pigeons
"begins next Saturday and some
of the pigeons may get Into
trouble If they continue this kind
of work.

beautiful. The women of the

director, is a master in the
