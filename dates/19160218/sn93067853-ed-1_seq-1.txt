UNION COUNTY
VOT
Bill Providing For Good Roads
Bond Issue Introduced by
Senator J. 0. Hughes?
Provides for Election
Next June.
A bill calling for an election in
Union county upon the question of a
quarter million dollar bond issue for
the building of good roads has been
introduced by Senator Hughes. It is
probable that the bill will be passed
and that there will be an election this
spring for good roads in this county.
The following is the full text of the
bill introduced by Senator Hughes:
A Bill to Authorize the Holding of
an Election vin Union County on the
Issuing of $230,000.00 of Coupon
Bonds for Building Permanent Roads,
to Name Seven Commissioners to Exbend
the Proceeds of Said Bonds and
Otherwise Define Their Duties, Powers
and Terms of Office.
Be it enacted by the General Assembly

INO MEASURE
ells Why He Can't Support
Proposal, Calling it Invasion
. of State Rights?Smyth
and Other Mill Men
Oppose Bill.
Washington, Feb. 15.?Capt. Ellison
l. Smyth and other leading cotton
lill men in South Carolina today apeared
before the senate committee
n commerce in opposition to the
of tho Kpotinir rhilrl labor
ill.
While much of the ground heretoore
gone over was covered again toay,
an interesting feature of the
learing was the fact that it developed
hat the Pelzer mill is probably the
riodel cotton mill of the country in
ts relation to the child labor question.
Questions were asked Capt. Smyth
vhich showed that while members of
he committee were well pleased with
chat they heard about the Pelzer mill
hey believed this one was far above
he general average.
In connection with this matter,
senator Tillman today said:
"I have received so many letters in
pgard to the Keating child labor bill,
ill of a similar character, that I have
lecided to prepare a statement of my
josition on the subject.
"I am opposed to any national child
abor law, because the subject matter
)f any such measure ought to be left
:o the States. The police powers of
jovernment?that is, matters affecting
the public health, public morals and
public safety?were reserved to the
States by the founders of the United
States government, who sought, thereby,
to safeguard the principle of local
self-government.
"It will be a sad day for us all when
the ordinary civil rights, privileges
and liabilities are defined and fixed
by' the central government at Washintgon.
Child labor is bad?all decent
people know that?but the destruction
of local self-government is worse.
Atiaolf nn Stalos
I "The Keating U."1, while ostensibly
^ry.lxerciM of UUfci*?wers of congress .
the States. If enacted Tnto~IawTTOi'
held constitutional, it will establish a
precedent which, when carried to its
logical conclusion, will reduce the
States to mere departments of the
general government. If congress can
use its delegated powers to accomplish
objects entirely foreign to those
for which they were granted, there is
no civil right or relation too sacred
for the United States government to
lay unhallowed hands on. The Keating
bill is too broad and sweeping, but
this is only on incidental objection:
.fundamental reason for opposing
it is that it is an attempt to usurp
the vital powers of the States. T can
not stand idly by and see local selfgovernment
torpedoed without warning.
"As to child labor in itself. I am
opposed to it, and am glad that the
South Carolina legislature has at last
taken action that will in a measure
abolish it. The new statute, as I understand
it, forbids the employment
of children under 1" years of age after
next July, and raises the age limit
' of employment toll years after July
1917. This is good in the main, but
' there should be an amendment pro^
vi'ding for the employment of children
under these ages when a widowed
mother is dependent upon their wov'*
. for support. ISucli cases are ran
. comparatively speaking, Init they do
. accur and should be provided for
s thought proper means should he tak
en to prevent abuse of the exception
il by collusion between heartless mill
- owners and worthless parents.
Favors Prohibiting It.
"With this one exception, I am
heartily in favor of prohibiting the
n employment of any child in cotton
i- mills or other manufacturing instii**
tutions. Indeed, in some respects T
would go farther than the legislature
Jr has gone. I would have the State for^
bid employment of any child under
10 1<? years of age who can not read and
write. This, in effect, would be an
excellent compulsory education clause:
? for parents, instead of being forced
e|. by the State to educate their children
^ ?which is, at best, a doubtful ex n.
pedient?would of their (own accord
place their children in school in order
to make them eligible for employ
' ment. I hope the legislature will approve
this idea and incorporate it in
l0e the new statute, if possible."
Capt. Smyth, who is president of
the South Carolina Textile Manufacrs
turers' association, today told the senate
