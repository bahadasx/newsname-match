ERRIFIC FIGHTING
ERE ERZERUM FELL
Petrograd Places the Number of Turkish Troops Cap
tured at 100,000 Men
GUNS TAKEN NUMBERED MORE THAN 1 ,000
Constantinople Report That the Russians Lost 5,000 MEN
Killed in Three Days at Erzerum There Have Been
No Important Developments in France and Belgium -Only
Isolated Infantry Attacks on the Russian Front
Italians Are Still Shelling Positions Taken by the Aus
trian in the Rombon Sector.
- Estimates from Petrograd place the
number of troops in the Turkish gar
rison at Erzerum, the capture of which
has been announced, at 100,000 men.
The guns numbered more than 1,000.
But it has not been yet officially stated
that all of these troops and guns were
taken by the Russians.
That the fighting- before the fortress
fell was terrific is indicated by a Con
stantinople report which, although not
announcing the capture of Edzerum,
says that In the three days before the
communication was issued the Rus
sians had lost 5,000 men killed.
'Both Berlin . and 'Paris report that
there have been no important develop
ments on the battlefield in France and
Belgium. Ob the Russian front there
have heen artillery engagements and
isolated infantry actions at various
points. In East Gallcia hostilities have
almost ceased for the present.
The Italians are still engaged in
shelling the positions taken from them
recently by the Austrians on the Rom
bon sector and also are keeping up
their artillery actions against the
bridgeheads at Tolmino and Gorizia,
An infantry attack against Monte San
Michele is reported by Vienna to have
been repulsed.
Germany has apologized to the
Dutch government and offered to pay
an indemnity for the torpedoing re
cently of the 'Dutch motor vessel Are
mis. The torpedoing is characterized
by Germany as a blunder on the part
of the commander of the torpedo boat.
. King Peter. Ait.. Serbia, at. present Jn
virtual exile on 'the island of Euboea,
in the Aegean sea, in a notable state
ment to an Associated Press corre
spondent, expresses his great grati
tude to the people of the United States
for the relief work done by Americans
among the sick and wounded and
starving Serbian people.
King Peter also took occasion to
say that for those of Serbia's allies
who had remained faithful he had no
reproach. "They came to our aid too
late to save us," he said, "but they
came."
That one of the Zeppelins in the
recent raid on 'England was damaged
by the British gunfire and later lost at
sea, and that there is good reason to
believe another had been damaged and
put out of action, was the statement
made in the house of lords by Earl
Kitchener, the British war secretary.

MRS LEONTINE LYMAN
TELLS OF MARRIED LIFE.
Witness in Bankruptcy Proceeding
Against Her Husband.
New York, Feb. 17. Mrs. Leontine
Lyman, wife of J. ' Grant Lyman, who
is being sought by the federal authori
ties on the charge of using the mails
in an oil stock swindle, appeared here
today 'before a United States commis
sioner as a witness in the bankruptcy
proceedings against her husband.
Mrs. Lyman, said she met Lyman for
the first time in 1914 in Paris, where
she was living with her first husband,
a British officer. She was divorced
soon afterward and came to this coun
try in February, 1915. She said Ly
man never told her much about his
business affairs and gave her little
money.
Mrs. Lyman returned only last Tues
day from a trip to England and declar
ed that the news of her husband's dis
appearance, which was first communi
cated to her upon her arrival here,
was a great shock. She heard from
him only twice while abroad, she add
ed. Lyman left behind a sable over
coat for which he was said to have
paid $15,000.

Hanged' for Wife Murder.
Concord, N. H, Feb. 18. Oscar B.
Comery was hanged at the state pris
on early today for the murder of his
wife. The trap was sprung' at 12.32.
He was officially pronounced dead at
12.45. ' ,
bishops in convocation today at Can
terbury cathedral adopted a resolution
against air raids "which have as a
deliberate object the killing -or wound
ing of non-combatants."
The Archbishop of Canterburs', in
moving the resolution, said the bish
ops desired to encourage all possible
energy in the prosecution of the ar,
but that there was danger of drifting
into ways which would have unhesi
tatingly been condemned as dishonor
able a few -years ago. There was
daneer, the archbishop added, when
proposals were made in the newspa
pers to put to death innocent persons
in retaliation for gross and outrageous
wrongs, that the moral currency might
be debased.
"We feel," said the archbishop, "that
one of our foremost desire.s surely is
that, when by the mercy of God this
fearful conflict comes to an end we
should enter upon a discussion of a
settlement with clean hands that we
should have nothing whereof to be
ashamed."
The Bishop of Bangor alone opposed
the resolution. "In a war like this,"
said the bishop, "we cannot separate
combatants from non-combatants. The
strengthening of the blockake against
Germany involves the ' making of war
on women and children. ' If we could
send a hundred aeroplanes to drop
bombs on the rich business part of
Frankfort the effect produced would
be felt from end to end of German
and the .sending of Zeppelins to this
country, -would -be-xienetmced-afl a blun
Uer, an inexcusable as a crime. If a
son of mine were asked to join in a
punitive expedition on a German town
I would advise him to go and do his
duty."

NEW ICE BREAKER FOR
HARBOR OF ARCHANGEL.
Is Expected to Release Nearly 100 Ves
sels Frozen in There.
St. John, N. F., Feb. 17. Nearly one
hundred vessels that have been froz
en up in the. harbor of Archangel,
Russia, may be released if the new
ice breaker, built in England and
shortly expected there fulfills expecta
tions, according to Captain Palk of
the steamer J3eothic who returned with
his crew from Russia today. The
Beothic, formerly a Newfoundland
sealer, was purchased by the Russian
admiralty and taken around the North
Cape to Archangel for ice breaking
service. Captain Polk reported that
in her trip over the Boethic was un
able to get within five miles of Arch
angel owing to the enormous Quantity
of ice. Other steamers landed their
cargoes, he said, at harbors near the
chief Russian centers of military and
naval importance.

tion of cabled reports that work on
the new Russian railroad from Petro
grad to Katherine Harbor, near the
Arctic coast, had been abandoned for
the winter because of severe weather
and lack of material.
KING PETER OF SERBIA
IN PHYSICALLY BROKEN
.
Hidden Away in Aedepose, Island of
Euboea.
Aedepose, Island of Euboea, Feb. 16,
5 p. m.. via Paris, Feb. 17, 8.25 p. m.
King Peter of Serbia received a corre.
spondent of The Associated Press this
morning. Hidden away in this almost
inaccessible spot, bent under his 72
years, disillusionments and sufferings,
physically broken, virtually blind, his
crown gone, his native . land overrun
by ancient enemies, the exiled sove
reign grimly clings to life in hope of
participating in the ultimate triumph
or his countrymen.
The severest trials have not dimmed
the spirit nor clouded the intellect of
the king. He spoke with the same
determined courage as characterized
him when he led his soldjers to victory
over the Turks and analyzed the
causes and meaning of the war with
the cold logic of the man who trans
lated John Stuart Mill into Serbian.
Though still feeble from the effects
of heart-breaking marches through
Albania and unable to walk without
assistance, he retains the keenest
mental activity and a striking cheeri
ness in the faec of the disaster which
has overtaken his country and family.

that the work of clearing the ruins will
follow within a short time. No at
tempt will 'be made to rebuild any of
the structures until the insurance has
been adjusted.

Strikers Rampant
in Ansonia Mills
MEN WHO REMAINED AT WORK
CARRIED OUT BODILY
ABOUT 4,500 IN NUMBER
After Closing the Mill the Mob March
Hilariously Up and Down the Main
Streets Aid Requested from New
Haven and Waterbury Police.
Ansonia. Conn., Feb. 17. The city
of Ansonia is in the throes of its larg
est and most, extraordinary labor trou
ble tonight. The peculiarities of the
strike which closed all the mills here
of the American Brass company are
that the strikers, about 4,500 in num
ber, are mostly of foreign birth, are
unskilled and although speaking a
dozen European languages, and many
of the men very little English, have
been secretly welded into one organi
zation without the assistance of an
officer of a recognized labor union. The
strikers are not and probably Jnve
not been members of any union, but
the mill officials, who were taken com
pletely by surprise, have as yet been
unable to find the agency through
which the great body of men was sud
denly moved into action.
Mob Made Everyone Stop Work.
The strike began late yesterday
when eight hundred laborers employ
ed in the brass mill struck for higher
wages. Today men began to dribble
out of the other mills of the American
Brass company until shortly afternoon
when suddenly hundreds of men swept
through the wire mill of the company,
making everyone stop work, not per
mitting men to dispose of molten met
al that they had in bottles, or even to
change their working clothes. The
onrush of humanity swelled into the
power plant and the engineers had to
shut down their engines. The crowd
then rushed through the mill yard and
across to the Tremont street entrance
of the copper mill, drivinsr everyone
before it and not permitting a single
person to remain at work.
Swept Through Coe Brass Plant.
The strikers, recruited to thousands,
then marched up the railroad tracks
to the plant of the Coe Brass company,
a subsidiary of the American Brass
company, and securing entrance by
breaking down some doors, swept into
all parts of the mills, ordering every
body to leave. There were a number
of young women who suddenly found
themselves surrounded by the strikers
and several threatened to jump out of
windows lr molested. .None of the
strikers offered violence to them but
no one was ggjjjd to remain al his
Threw Wrenches at Man on a Crane.
Martin Flood was aloft on a crane
in one of the rooms. The crowr; or
dered him down and because he did
not move fast enough wrenches were
tnrown at him. The crane had been
loading barrels on a truck and as the
crane chain was swung loose from the
truck Flood secured hold of a ladder
on the side wall, by which he made his
descent amid showers of missiles
which, however, did not hit him. Once
on the ground Flood had to run tosave
himself from injury.
General Manager Moody Assaulted
General Manager John Moody, of
the plant, was in his office and he
sought to barricade himself against
the crowd. But the office doors were
broken in and Moody ordered out,
someone hitting him during the strug
gle. . He was only painfully bruispd.
The crowd completely cleared out the
Coe Brass Mills, not permitting men
who were handling metal in hot air
furnaces to save it.
Marched Hilariously Through Streets.
After closing the mills the crowd
marched hilariously up and down the
main streets, the several nationalities
singing and shouting in their own ton
gues. At a later hour a mass meeting of
the strikers decided to appoint a com
mittee to wait upon the mill manage
ment tomorrow and make demands for
higher wages.
Differ as to What They Want.
The matter of formulating demands
immediately became a source of trou
ble to the committee as the strikers
have no one line of trade but are help,
ers to moulders, roller makers, casters
and the diversified skilled trades in
the metal industry. Some of the strik
ers want 25 cents a day increase"! oth
ers a dollar increase and still others
the eight-hour day, a minimum wane
of $2 and Saturday half holidays. The
company has already posted a notice
of a wage increase of 25 cents a dr.y
to unskilled labor which has received
$2.SO or less, and a 10 per cent, in
crease to all over $2.50 a day.
Discord at Mass Meeting.
The mass meeting showed signs of
discord when a proposition was made
to try and "run out" strikebreakers
who have been separately housed and
fed by the Farrel Foundry company
since its moulders' strike early last
summer. These men have been living
in a new mill of the company and go
to work through a covered way. The
mass meeting discussed making an ef
fort to try and get at these strike
breakers and induce them to leave
work. There are also in the Farrell
foundry many men who are not strike
breakers who are of the same nation
ality as many of the strikers and the
latter are most urgent in their de
mands that efforts be made to get
these workers out.
Mayor Asks Police Aid from Other
Cities.
Mayor Schumaker tonight began
swearing in volunteer firemen as spe
cial police officers and assigned them
to duty in the several mills to protect
property. He also made requests of
the chief of police of New Haven and
Waterbury for a detail of officers,
asking for 25 from Waterbury and 15
or 20 from New Haven.
Mayor Asked to Close Saloons.
The mayor also was requested to
close the liquor saloons to prevent any
unruliness but the mayor wash of the
opinion that he could not do this un
less martial law was proclaimed. It
was noticeable that tonight many
strikers who were on the street were
showing- signs of indulgence in liquor,
although no reports had come to the
police that citizens had been molested
or property damaged outside' of the
mill yards.
Men Carried Out Bodily. .- -

the mills brooked no interference. Sev

Two Views of
Louis D. Brandeis
PLACED BEFORE SENATE SUB-
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
HONEST.UNSCRUPULOUS
Moses J. Stroock Testified That Bran
deis Had Been Unethical in Bringing
Ten Suits Against the New England
Railroad in 1892.
Washington. Feb. 17. Two views of
Louis D. Brandeis were' placed today
before the judiciary sub-committee of
the senate Investigating his fitness to
be supreme court justice.
Capable but Unscrupulous.
Moorfleld Storey, a Boston lawyer,
said Mr. Brandeis' reputation at the
Boston bar was that he was a "very
capable, very energetic man and if ne
cessary to advance his objects is not
scrupulous as to his methods, nor is
he to be trusted.
Sincere but Careless.
Sherman L. Whipple, of Boston, de
scribed Mr. Brandeis as a man with
sincere, high-minded motives; intense
ly centered in carrying out his own
ideas and ideals: in love with the idVa
that he was "looking after the situa
tion"; possibly a bit careless in his
connection with one of his cases: and
as holding himself aloof with the re
suit that he had been misjudged.
Moses J. Stroock, a New York law
yer, testified briefly. He quoted Mr.
Brandeis as having said that everyone
should get a square deal in the James
T. Lennox bankruptcy case, which
has been much discussed at the hear
ing.
Charged With .Being Unethical.
Mr. Storey told the committee he
thought Mr. Brandeis had been un
ethical in bringing ten suits against
the New England railroad in 1892, for
interests other than the actual com
plainants, which preceded by a year
the bankruptcy of the New England
road from which it emerged in posses
sion of the New Haven railroad. He
was unwilling, however, to give his
opinion that Mr. Brandeis was em
ployed to wreck the New Haven road.
In the Warren will case. Mr. Storey
thought that Mr. Brandeis had acted
as he himself would have done.
A CONSTRUCTIVE POLICY
FOR THE UNITED STATES
Outlined by Senator Newlands to New
Haven Chamber of Commerce.
New Haven, Conn.. Feb. 17. Out
lining "a constructive policy for the
united States to the members of the
New Haven Chamber of Commerce at
its annual dinner tonight, United
estates Senator F. G. Newlands of Ne
vada, the chief guest, eaid there was a
two-fold peril to America in the fu
ture, namely, possible inability to back
up with force of arms, if necessary, the
insistence of our government regarding
neutral rights, and possible inability
to meet economic eonditions which the
termination of the European war may
bring. The great questions to be con
eidered, the senator said, relate to
military and industrial preparedness.
Military strength may be required "be
cause we have aroused the antagonism
of the peoples of the warring nations,
and industrial strength because of the
military forces to industrial pursuits,
reinforcing vast numbers of women
and children who have been developed
to the highest degree of industrial ef
ficiency, may insure a spirited con
test with us not only for international
but domestic markets, the loss of the
latter meaning domestic unemployment
and want."
NAVAL SECRETS IMPARTED TO
HOUSE NAVAL COMMITTEE
Programmes of European Navies and
Weaknesses of the American Fleet.
Washington, Feb. 17. Confidential
information about the building pro
grammes of European navies, weak
nesses of the American fleet and re
sults of recent manoeuvres and war
college games was given to the house
naval committee today by Rear Ad
miral Grst, commanding the sub
marine flotilla, and Captain Josiah
McKean, assistant for material in the
office of the chief of operations. Both
officers expressed the opinion that even
with the administration's five year
building programme completed the
United States would be poor third
among naval powers.
The committee spent most of the
day behind closed doors, taking up
with the officers questions considered
confidential by the navy department.
The witnesses agreed that battle
cruisers were most urgently needed
than battleships and recommended the
construction of four such vessels this
year, if congress would authorize no
more capital ships, rather than two
battleships and two battle cruisers, as
proposed.

German Note
Not Acceptable
LANSING WANTS AGREEMENT
COVERING ALL POINTS
PLAN IS INCONSISTENT
Tentative Agreement Designed to Set
tle the Lueitania Case Will Not be
Formally Accepted Until Germany
Recedes from Her Present Plan.
Washington. Feb. 17. Th T"nitH
States in its. submarine controversy
with Germany will accept nothing
short of a full and complete agreement
covering all the points for. which it
nas contended as to assurances that
the warfare in the future will vbe con
ducted in accordance with the estab
lished principles of the international
law.
German Attitude Inconsistent.
In announcing this fact today Sec
retary Lansing let it be known that
the state department considers Ger
many's declaration of its intention to
sink without warning after Feb. 2,
all armed merchant ships of the en
tente allies to be inconsistent with the
assurances previously given by this
government by the Berlin foreign gov
ernment. Holds Up Lusitania Agreement.
The tentative agreement designed to
end the Lusitania case, still in the
possession of Secretary Iansing, will
not be formally accepted until such
assurances regarding the future are
given, although the communication
in so far as it relates to the Lusitania
itself, is acceptable.
State department officials also con
sider that the Austro-Hungarian mem
orandum regarding armed ships is not
in accord with the assurances given
by the government in the negotiations
over the sinking of the Italian steam
ship Ancora. Consequently final set
tlement of the Ancona case, once post
poned because of doubt regarding the
circumstances of the sinking of the
British steamship Persia, probablv
will be withheld, until Austria gives
assurances similar to those now re
quired from Germany.
Views Explained to Von Bernstorff.
The views of the United States were
explained in detail today by Secretary
Lansing to Count Von Bernstorff,- the
flermnn .imhacaHnr TVla a mfea aa,4n.
was informed it was indicated at the
state department that the Unitea
States desires the German declaration
regarding armed merchant ships to be
modified.
Later in the day the ambassador
sent a long despatch to his government
explaining the position and require
ments of the United States. It was
understood the ambassador informed
his government that the United States
wanted .particularly to know whether
the assurances previously given in the
Lusitania and the Arabic cases still
were in force.
Germany Wants Assurance from Brit-
Tonight it was stated emphatically
in Teutonic diplomatic circles that the
Berlin foreign office would not modify
the declaration intention to sink arm
ed ships or inform the United States
the previous assurances still 'were
binding unless Great Britain should
give assurances of some kind that a'
submarine which warns a British
steamship armed, ostensibly for defen
sive purposes, would not be fired upon.
In this connection it was explained
at the state department that the Unit
ed States considers unarmed merchant
ships and ships armed for defensive
purposes to be in identically the sarao
class. Furthermore, it . is held that
the word "liner" as employed in the
.previous assurances from Germany re
garding the conduct of - submarine
warfare includes freight . as well as
passenger ships. , . , -
It was declared at the department
that at no time had suggestions been
made to the German government
which would have led it to issue its
latest memorandum.
MASSACHUSETTS DAIRYMEN
COMPLAIN OF CAR SYSTEM.
Has Resulted in a Monopoly of Milk
Supply t a Combination of Dealers.
Boston. Feb. 17. Disadvantages to
Massachusetts dairymen through the
operation of the leased car system for
brinping milk to this city were con
sidered at an investigation of milk and
cream transportation rates begun to
day. by. Chairman C. C. McCord of the
Interstate Commerce commission.
This system, .dairymen of the state
contend, has resulted in a monopoly
of ; milk and cream supply by dealers
who have been enabled to divide amfng
themselves territory distant from Bos
ton, to the vir'-iial exclusion of dairy
men whose plants are near the local
market. The ' maximum charge . of
$18,000 a year for a car, imposed by the
railroads for milk carriers running any
distance beyond 165 miles from- this
city, was the object of ' special "criti
cism. Most of the dairymen ear.d ' were
from points north of Boston.
