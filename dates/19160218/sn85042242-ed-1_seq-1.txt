ADDRESS TONIGHT AT

Bill Before Congress an Outrage
and Betrayal of Our
Trust.
"From rio point of view," said Dr.
Rader last evening, "are the Filipinos
ready for self government. They are
making splendid progress along every
line. If we can only coach them
awhile longer, there is every reason
to believe that they will present such
an effective type of democracy in the
Orient that all the surrounding people
will demand thai form of government.
Democracy to Break Down.
"If there is a decrease in efficiency
and purpose just now, democracy ill
the Philippines cannot help breaking
down. There are two score or more
of dialects in the Philippines that
have divided the people into clans or
tribes that have been more or less
warlike toward each other. Under
the American government, all these
•people are learning English and are
therefore wiping out racial differ­
ences. But they have not progressed
far enough as ytit.
Just Beginning.
"The English speaking generation
is just beginning to come into promi­
nence. There is no question but that
the Spanish reactionaries will endeav­
or to undo all that our democracy h£js
accomplished thus far. The Philip­
pines have reached the stage of the
i5-year-old boy.' A boy might-be turn­
ed loose at that age and make a suc­
cess of life, but the chances are all
against him.
Japan Would Benefit.
"It is the conviction of not only all
the Americans in the Philippines, but
of a large number of the iFilipinos
themselves, that Immediate Independ­
ence would result In their speedy ab­
sorption by Japan.
"There is a strong national spirit
among the people. If It were not for
that, there would be very little hope
for the future."
Dr. Rader is connected with the
Methodist Episcopal work. He has
been district superintendent at Manila
for nine years. The work of the
church there has grown very rapidly.
The church has now nearly 40,000
members in the Philippines.
"The Filipinos are a spiritual
minded people," he continued, "and
very susceptible to the influence of
the gospel. They are a very musical
people also.
Stamped Out Disease.
"The death rate in the islands has
•been reduced 60 per cent, a record un­
excelled in any country. They have
stamped out smallpox, cholera plague
and other tropical diseases. The pro­
gress along this line has been remark­
able.
"Thirteen years ago there were
more than 6,000 lepers ?.t large, ylr.
Taft said that the first thing to be
done was to segregate them. They
were collected from all of the islands
and taken to Culion, a small Island
that was given over ,to them-. "They
have a republic of their own and
every comfort is given, them. The
department of science at Manila has
performed wonders in experimenting
in leprosy. The germ has been sep­
arated and for the first, time treat­
ment has been applied and cures ef­
fected in several instances. For in­
stance, more than 200 cases were
cured and sent home.

Six Battleships Will Be Used to
Take Civilians on One Month
Cruise.
NEW PLAN WILL HELP
ESTABLISH A RESERVE
Washington, Feb. 17.—.Secretary
Daniels and his advisers today decid­
ed to inaugurate a system of civilian
naval training similar to that on
which training camps have been es­
tablished at :Plattsburg, N. Y., and
elsewhere. It is planned to use six
battleships to take those who present
themselves for training for a month's
cruise, beginning about August 15.
The vessels' to be utilized as train­
ing ship will take on their student
personnel along the Atlantic coast.
It is estimated that the six battle­
ships .will make possible the training
of 2,500 men.
The plan proposes that' the cost to
the men shall be sufficiently low to
enable those in moderate circum­
stances to join. The only compulsory
requirement is that each volunteer
declare his intention of giving his
services to the navy in case of war.
The object of the plan is to estab­
lish a naval reserve of civilians, ex­
clusive of former enlisted men and
those of the professional seafaring
classes.
Aedesos, Island of Euboea, via Par­

bent under his 72 years by disilluslon
ments and sufferings, physically brok­
en, virtually blind, his crown gone,
his native land overrun by ancient
enemies, the exiled sovereign clings
to life in the hope of participating
in the ultimate triumph of his coun­
try. tHe spoke with the same deter­
mined courage which characterized
him when he led his soldiers to vic­
tory over the Turks and analyzed the
causes and meaning of the war with
the cold logic of the man who trans­
lated the works of John Stuart Mill
into Serbian.

"I have long wanted very mu6h to

is so deeply moved over the fajte oi

ON MEXICO IS
President Wilson Refuses to Send
Confidential Matter to
Senate.
LANSING IN LETTER
SUMMARIZES EVENTS
Seventy-Six Americans Killed in
Mexico During Last Three
Years.
Washington, 'Feb. 17.—President
Wilson sent to the senate today his
response to the Fall resolution, adopt­
ed last month, requesting him to re­
port on facts leading up to recogni­
tion by the United States of the de
facto government of IMexico, headed
by General Carranza.
It was in the form of a long letter
from Secretary Lansing, summarizing
the events which preceded recogni­
tion and transmitting a great volume
of data, including a list of all Ameri­
cans killed in Mexico and along the
border during the past six years.
Declines to Comply.
The President declined to comply
with that part of the Fall resolution
asking for diplomatic and consular re­
ports on political conditions and
events in fMexico. The senate was in­
formed that it was not compatible
with public interests to furnish this
correspondence, inasmuch as it was
of a highly confidential nature, and
"submitted to consular officers of the
United States by diplomatic or con­
sular officer^ of other governments,
which have gratuitously consented
that their officers might supply this
government with information during
the necessary absence of American
lopresentatives and by other persons
residing in Mexico."
Says Carranza Controls.
As to the ability of Carranza to
fulfill his promises to protect foreign
LanBlnflWMi®
man^e'T^rrmR^rmimstances, flie
do facto gbvernmeht', which at the
Lime of recognition' controlled more
than 75 per cent of Mexico's territory,
was affording "reasonably adequate
protection to the lives and property
of American citizens."
The data disclosed that 7G Ameri
cans were killed in Mexico in the
^years IMS, 1»14 and 1015, as compar­
ed with 47 in the three years preced
ing, and that 20 civilian Americana
and 16 soldiers were killed on Ameri
can soil in the last three years as a
result of Mexican troubles.
Senator Fall Disappointed.
When the report was received, /Sen­
ator Stone, chairman of the foreign
relations committee, moved that it lie
on the table and be printed as a pub
lie document. iHe made no comment
on its contents. Senator .Fall ex
pressed himself as 'disappointed be
cause the president had not included
the confidential correspondence.
The response to the resolution is
expected to stir up a new discussion
of the situation in the senate and to
bring a vote quickly in the nomina
tion of iHenry Prather Fletcher as am­
bassador to Mexico.
Senator Fall introduced his resolu­
tion when the nomination was sent
in. Republican members of the for­
eign relations committee held that
the senate should not consent to send­
ing an ambassador to Mexico until it
was informed as to the character of
the government to which he was to
toe accredited.
In view of the report, it is prob­
able the foreign relations committee
will pass on 'Mr. Fletcher's nomina­
tion next Wednesday.
Exiled King of Serbia
Now Blind and Uncrowned
Praises the Americans
so gladly given their young lives to
fight typhus and the sickening ef­
fects of shells and epidemics, of
whom not a few rest forever in Ser­
bian soils—was it not they who
brought to us the soul of a kindred
people from America?"
The aged king leaned forward, fix­
ed the correspondent with wide open,
almost sightless eyes.
"May God in His mercy reward
your country!" he cried.
Does iNot Blame Allies.
Then he was silent a long time.
"I know what you are thinking."
he continued finally. "You are wrong.
For those of our allies who have re­
mained faithful we have no reproach.
They cajne to our aid too late to
save us.' But they came. They were
not organized for war, nor ruled over
by soldiers. Had they been so organ­
ized, so ruled, perhaps they would
have been able to save us.
"Civilization cannot be made an en­
gine of war and perfected to force
every contingency. It is inherent in
liberty that it acts slowly, clumsily,
perhaps, but this very slowness and
clumsiness constitutes the strength
of a free people. It is slow coming,
but none the less sure."

it has contended af' to assurances
that' the warfare in the future will be
conducted in accordance with the es­
tablished principles of international
law.
In announcing tjrat. fact today, Sec­
retary Lansing let it be known that
the state department considers Ger­
many's declaration of its intention to
sink, without warning, after February
29, all armed merchant vessels of
the Entente allies, to be inconsistent
with the assurances given previously
by the 'Berlin government.
Won't Accept Terms.
The tentative communication de­
signed to end the Lusitania case, still
in the possession of Secretary Lan­
sing, will not be accepted formally
until such assurances regarding the
future are given, although the com­
munication in -so far as it relates to
the Lusitania itself is acceptable.

sider that the Austro-Hungarian mem­
orandum regarding armed ships is
not in accord with the assurances
given by that government in the ne­
gotiations over the sinking of
Italian steamship. At'

Views Explained.
The views of the United States
were explained in detail today by
Secretary Lansing to Count von Bern
storff, the German ambassador. The
ambassador was informed, if was in­
dicated at the stale department, that
the United States desires the Ccr
man declaration regarding merchant
ships to be modified.
Tonight it was slated emphatically
in Teutonic diplomatic circles that
the Berlin foreign office would not
modify the decimal ion of their in­
tention to sink armed ships or inform
the United States the previous assur­
ances still were binding, unless Great
Britain should give assurances of
some kind that a submarine which
warns a lEritish steamship armed os­
tensibly for defensive purposes would
not be fired upon.
Another note from Sweden has
been addressed to the state depart­
ment through Minister Ekengren, ap­
pealing to the United States for co­
operation with the Swedish govern­
ment and other neutral nations to
maintain the preservation of rules of
international law, concerning the pro­
tection of neutral commerce and navi­
gation.
Action is proposed particularly
against Great Britain because of the
detention of mail by that country and
other aggressions against trade re­
garded by Sweden as unwarranted.
Secretary Lansing informed the min
ister, it was learned today, that he
could not answer the note until the
controversy with Germany over the
Lusitania case was settled.

Xew York, Feb. 17.—Hans Schmidt,
the former priest, who is to be execut­
ed at Sing Sing prison tomorrow
morning for the murder of Anna Muel­
ler, issued a statement tonight
through his attorney, Alphonse G.
Koelle, declaring he was "fully'recon­
ciled to die and willing to accept
death as retribution for his frailty."
Schmidt asserted, however, that he
will be executed for "Heine and not
for murder," because Miss Mueller's
death resulted from an operation, and
adds:
"I felt wholly responsible for the
girl's death, and in honor could not
drag those to ruin who took part in
the operation at my solicitation."

located the work-shop and assembly
department, equipped with modern
machinery and appliances and oper­

will be the first of its type erected in
Bismarck's rapidly growing wholesale

will exceed $.H),0(IO.
Has Had Rapid Growth.
The .Missouri Valley Motor Co., now
less than two years old, has enjoyed
a very rapid and substantial growth.
First incorporated October 8, 1914, by
L. A. Tavis, J. P. Hess and H. H.
Moore, the company was reorganized
and its capital increased August 4,
1915, when I'. C. Remington, B. C.
Marks and Carl Pederson of Bismarck,
and H. R. Lyons of Minneapolis acquir­
ed an interest. Mr. .Pederson, who
had previously represented the Deere
Webber Plow Co. in this territory for
a period of eleven years, and one of
the most successful and popular sales­
men in the Bismarck district, was
made manager.
The company has the agency for
the Chalmers automobile in two-thirds
of North Dakota, and for the Dodge in
the southwestern quarter. It also

break of the war, and later taken to
Germany, has been liberated and

The military governor of Brussels
announced the arrest of Burgomaster

1914, in a public poster, which said:
"I have found myself obliged to

fcXpert9 Organization.
"Service" has from the fiifet been a
fetish with the Missouri Valley Co.,
and to this fact, as much as to the
popularity of the lines handled, is due
the organization's truly remarkable
development. Recently there has
been added to the staff 'R. A. Iloorn,
for seven years engaged in a large
automobile repair business in Fergus
Falls, Minn., and who is an expert
machinist and automobile specialist.
The company has adopted the rule of
placing each service department in
charge of an expert and the result has
been as satisfactory to the organiza­
tion as il has to its clients.
In the sales department are W. E.
Welch and B. (5. Whit lock, both of
whom are specialists in their line. C.
R. Dalrymple otllciates as cashier and
is in charge of the bookkeeping de­
partment. No detail of the compact
ami smooth-running organization has
been slighted.
To Deliver 600 Cars.
This year the company has contract­
ed to deliver (500 cars, and it is not
one car behind its schedule today. A
recent order consisted of a carload of
Chalmers for Towner. Every day
buyers are arriving from points
throughout the Bismarck territory. In
the course of a year, this one sales or­
ganization will bring to Bismarck
hundreds of people, eyospective car
owners anxious to personally inspect
before they buy purchasers who
come to drive home their cars, small­
er dealers who wish to gain the bene­
fit of the company's sales and service
departments.
Bismarck is daily gaining prestige
as an automobile sales center. This
year it will distribute not less than
2,a0ft cars. No one commercial inter­
est brings to the city more people or
places in circulation here more money.
The permanent intrenchment of so
substantial an organization as the
Missouri Valley Motor Co. in an at­
tractive, up-to-the-minute plant locat­
ed on the Red Trail will serve to call
attention to the capital cjiv's promi­
nence in this respect, and will, it is
predicted, lead to similar expansion
upon the part of other automobile dis­
tributors.

London, Feb. 17—The case of a
woman spy who was recently sen­
tenced to death, but whose sentence
was commuted to penal servitude for
life, was announced in the house of
commons today by Herbert 'L. Sam­

affairs.
The woman was found guilty in
criminal court, the home secretary
staled. She was not a British sub­
ject.
This is the first time since the be­
ginning of the war, it was stated, that
a woman has been given so severe a
prison sentence in England for espi­
onage.

Walter Runciman, president of the
board of trade, replied to the attacks
explaining that while the situation
was far from balng satisfactory, the
