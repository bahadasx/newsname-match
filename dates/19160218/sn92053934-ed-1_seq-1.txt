Murderer Delivers a Fare
well Talk Before His
Prison Execution.
KILLED ANNA AUMULLER
Grewsome Butchery of His
Sweetheart Is Atoned
With Own Life.
Osfining, N". Y., Feb. 18. Hans
Schmidt was electrocuted at Sing Sing
prison today for the murder of Anna
Aumuller Sept. 2. 1913.
Schmidt went quietly to the death
chamber, accompanied by the princi-1
pal keeper and the Rev. Father Cashin,
th prison chaplain. Leaving the
death house, he said good-bye to those
who remained. When he entered the
chamber, the guards attempted to di
rect him toward the chair but Schmidt
gently shook them off and insisted on
addressing the 17 witnesses. The
guards desisted from their efforts, and
with Father Cashin standing at one
Bide and the keeper at the other,
Schmidt said:
Asks Forgiveness.
"Gentlemen, I ask forgiveness of all
those I have injured or scandalized. I
forgive all those who have injured me.
My last wish is to say good-bye to my
dear old mother."
Schmidt then seated himself in the
electric chair and the current was ap
plied three times. Within, a minute he
ww dead. He had spent the night up
to midnight in praying and talking
with Father CasaiD,- and slept from
midnight to 6 o'clock, when he was
awakened for breakfast. He would
tike only a cup of coffee.
Body Washed lp on Shore.
New York, Feb. 18. When the torso
of Anna Aumuller's body was washed
up on the New Jersey shore of the
Hudson river there started a search
which has had but few parallels in the
Minals of New York crime. There was
but one faint clue, a pillowslip on
which was embroidered the letter "A,"
but it was just such a pillow slip as
might be found in hundreds of homes
or stores. There was not even a laun
dry mark to aid the police. With this
Blender clew,. Inspector Faurot took
personal charge of the case, and on
Sept 14, 1913, 12 days after the murder,
Hans Schmidt, an assistant priest at
an uptown church, was arrested, charg
ed with the crime. An hour before
the arrest the inspector had broken
Into a flat and found a long bladed
butcher's knife and other evidence
that the murder had been committed
there. Schmidt confessed and his sole
defense was that it was a "blood sacri
fice murder." The body had been dis
membered and presumably all of it
was thrown into the river, although
the head was never found. Schmidt
was twice placed on trial, the first
jury, in December, 1913, failing to
reach a verdict. In February, 1914,
be was found guilty.
Had Career of Crime.
Besides the sordid story of Anna
Aamuller's infatuation for Schmidt,
tint tjials revealed that his was a ca
reer of crime. He was engaged in a
counterfeiting scheme at the time the
murder was committed, and "Dr." A.
Muret, who posed as a dentist, waa
ent to the penitentiary for seven years
m Schmidt's accomplice in the Iatter's
scheme. It was found that Schmidt
!o had posed as a physician, that he
bad committed numerous forgeries and
had been guilty of other frauds. His
morn era pleaded their client was in
ane. The slayer, however, always
contended that he was sane. He took
no active part In his own defense.
When he was sentenced he thanked the
court and expressed a desire to be exe
cuted at once. He maintained the same
stolid composure through all the va
rious stages of bis case.

THE WAR
TODAY
Artillery exchanges are In prog

Austro-Itallan fronts, but from
none of these fronts has a report
come of a notable chancre in the
position of any of the belliger
ents. Mneh speculation regarding the
prohnble fnture course of the
events In the campaign about Kr

there Is little positive Information
regarding the numbers and posi

report says the Russians have
pushed a force northwest from
Erzernm and that this body of
troops already has reached Baihnrt,
"5 miles away on the road to Treb
Izond, the important Turkish port
on the Black sea.
Reports of a mutiny of Hindu
troops in Egypt come today
through (ierman channels. A cir

Cologne newspaper declared that
an entire regiment mutinied after
an Australian officer had shot two
Mohammedan servants who had
made some mistake. TwelTe Brit

the account, and it was only after
two hours of righting by Austral

LODGE BACKS
POLICY USED
ASANEUTRAL
Senator Urges Administra
tion tovKeep to Course
Being Pursued.
DANGER IN ANY CHANGE
Sees Trouble in Any Altera
tion of United States'
Present Stand.
Washington, Feh IS. Senator
Lodge, ranking minority member of
the foreign relations committee, made
a speech in the senate today declaring
that abandonment by the United States
at this time of the principle that its
ports were open to and its citizens
free to travel upon merchantmen of
belligerent nations armed solely for
defensive purposes, would be an un
neutral act and a step toward war. He
said 4t would make the United States
the ally of the belligerent whose mer
chant marine had been swept from the
seas.
Forsees Tronble In Policy Change.
The senator spoke at length, dwell
ing on the history of international law
relating to the arming of merchant
men for defense and citing precedents
In the record of the United States. He
referred to reports that the adminis
tration was preparing to change its
policy, which have been denied by
Secretary Lansing since the issuance
of the German and Austrian memoran
dums announcing their intention to
treat armed merchant ships as war
vessels after Feb. 29. As late as the
by Mr. Bryan',' Senator Lodge said, this
government recognized that "Ameri
can citizens were within their undis
puted rights in taking their ships and
in traveling wherever their legitimate
business calls them on the high seas.
"The abandonment of those rights by
any neutral government on the ground
that the invention of submarines with
the necessary limitations on the pow
ers of capture possessed by those
boats "is inconceivable. Such aban
donment could only rest on the ground
that the rights of neutrals, the rules
which for centuries have been agreed
upon by all nations for the protection
of innocent lives on vessels captured
in war, must be thrown aside and dis
carded in order that a new instrument
of maritime destruction must not be
impeded in Its work of death and mur
der. Two Sides to Matter.
"There is, however, another side to
this matter which is of even graver
importance. There can be no question
that any act by a neutral which alters
conditions created by the war is an
unneutral act and places the neutral
on the side of one belligerent or th"e
other.
"This is eminently true of any form
of embargo, and there is no need that
I should repeat the unanswerable ar
gument on this point embodied by Mr.
Lansing in his note of last August to
the government of Austria-Hungary.
The war and the war alone has also
created conditions under which any
change at this time in the attitude
which we took officially at the outset
of the war in regard to armed mer
chantmen would be an unneutral act.
"I cannot believe that the adminis
tration thinks for a moment of alter
ing the well defined position which it
took at the outset of the European war
and I believe that it must stand as

RAT IS USED TO SOLVE
CANTON WIRE RIDDLE
Canton, 111., Feb. 18. Success crown
ed the week old efforts of two local
rural telephone company managers
yesterday when they established phys
ical connection between their ex
changes here, in compliance with an
order of the public utilities commis
sion. It was necessary to run the line
through a conduit 434 feet long, but
of narrow diameter. A week ago a rat
with a silk fishline to his tail was
started through the small passage. A
ferret sent after him to hurry him up
was too ambitious and caught the rat.
The entire collection of rats gathered
through the medium of a newspaper
want ad were sent through the conduit,
but the managers were never able to
judge properly the ferret's handicap.
Yesterday a local inventive genius
suggested tying a bell on a rat. This
was done. The fish line was dragged
through by the rat and then in turn a
fine copper wire was drawn through
liand-over-hand. The rat neglected to
stop and as a reward for faithful ser
vice he was permitted to escape.

RUSSIAN TROOPS
ARE PRAISED AT
FALLOF ERZERUM
Jetrogra"d" B'eb." IS, (via London,
2:20p. m.) The fall of Erzerum, the
most important Turkish stronghold in
Asia Minor, and for a long time con
sidered impregnable, offers the unpre
cedented spectacle of a first class fort
ress built on a steep mountain ridge
nearly a mile above sea level yielding
to bayonet attack after only 36 hours
bombardment.
The operations were conducted un
der the most severe weather condi
tions, the snow being deep and the
thermometer registering at times more
than 30 degrees below zero.
The Turkish army defending Er
zerum, taken by surprise under the
methods, adopted by the Russians, is
now said to be in disorderly flight on
the roads leading to Sivas. As the gar
rison apparently scattered in all di
rections, it is assumed here that large
numbers of menwere taken prisoner,
although official figures are still lack
ing1. After the taking of Niskala, it ap
peared that the Russian attack would
be directed on the Turkish right flank,
and by rapidly transferring troops, the
Turks made all plans to resist the
main assault from this quarter. Ap
parently they had little fear of the suc
cess of this attack because of the
strong character of the fortifications
in that direction and even less appre
hension of danger from a frontal at
tack. Nevertheless, after the Russians
took by storm the first line forts Feb.
2, there began a persistent bombard
ment of the Turkish center, followed
by a bayonet charge, which swept the
defenders off their feet. The highest
tribute is paid to the bravery of the
Caucasian troops, whose charge is con
sidered one of the most brilliant feats
of the war.
It is recognized here that the suc
cess of the assault was due almost en
tirely to the bayonet work of these
troops, since the artillery preparation
was insufficient in intensity and dura
tion, according to military experts, to
reduce even a strong field position.
The wiping out of this Turkish base
tends to disrupt the whole Caucasus
campaign of the Turks, as it not only
served as a base of operations in the
Caucasus, but also of those in Meso
potamia. Its fall leaves no strongly
fortified point between Erzerum and Si
vas, about 230 miles to the west, and
brings more to the front consideration
of an eventful attack on Constanti
nople from the east
An attempt to retake Erzerum is an
ticipated, but there are enormous dif
ficulties attending the bringing up of
Turkish reinforcements, as it is as
sumed that Turkish forces in Meso
potamia cannot be spared. The al
ternative for the Turks seems to be
to draw on those at Constantinople
from which all possible routes towards
Erzerum are long and arduous. The
most practicable is by railway to Urfa,
whence it would be necessary to march
overland more than 200 mileB. The
Black sea route to Trebizond has be
come impracticable because of the
Russian dumiuation of the Black sea
littoral
QMQPUA PHiO SOPHY-
Charge That
Harvester Is
Behind War
Washington, Feb. 18. Charges that
the International Harvester company
had furnished money for arms and am
munition for the Ortez-Argimedo rev
olution against the Carranza govern
ment in Yucatan, Mexico, were made
today by Levy Mayer of Chicago in
the senate agriculture committee's in
vestigation into an alleged monopoly
for control of the sisal market.
Walter L. Fisher, former secretary
of the interior, counsel for the har
vester company, displayed to the com
mittee a bundle of bills, part of 3,500,
000 pesos issued by the Yucatan com
mission, formed for controlling the
sisal crop. He was undertaking to
explain that the bills had come into
the possession of the harvester com
pany from a draft for $480,000 gold is
sued to Angelino Montes, a sisal pur
chaser, who the Yucatan planters as
sert represented solely the harvester
company, when he was interrupted by
Mayer, who declared they gave the
draft to raise money for stirring up
a revolution.
"That's just talk," retorted Mr.
Fisher.
The Ortez-Argimedo government
had control of Yucatan for a short
time in 1915 and was overcome by
the Carranza army.
Testimony given by H. L. Daniels,
manager of the fibre department of the
International Harvester company. In
the government's anti-trust suit was
read to show that the International in
1909, after having bought 220,000 bales
of sisal at 4 to ib cents a pound, put
the prices up to 6 cents to prevent
the Plymouth Cordage company, which
it then was fighting, from making a
profit that year.
Mr. Fisher declared the harvester
company in spite of purchasing its
sisal at a low figure, had not taken ad
vantage of the increase in price to
raise its price of twine to the dealer,
Its profit that year being an average of
only 24 per cent, the lowest of any
year's twine business.

SUBMARINE CASE
IS DISCUSSED AT
CABINET MEETING
Washington, Feb. 18. The subma
rine situation with it3 new develop
ments was discussed at today's cabinet
meeting. Secretary Lansing went to
the White House before the cabinet as
sembled and discussed the question with
the president at some length. It was
indicated today that Austria, too, will
be notified of the assurances which the
United States is asking for the future,
so that the position of this government
may be fully and uniformly known to
the Germanic allies.
A long dispatch from Ambassador
Bernstorff was on its way to Berlin to
day explaining that in its negotiations
with Germany over submarine warfare
the United States will accept nothing
short of a complete agreement cover
ing all points for which it .has con
tended as to assurance that the war
fare in the future .will.be. conducted
with the established principals of in
ternational law.
It is understood that the ambassador
informed his. government .that the
United States considers Germany's
declaration' of ' its intention to sink
armed merchantmen without warning
after Feb. 29, inconsistent with the as
surances given in the Arabic case. It
was said that he told the Berlin for
eign office that Secretary Lansing has
informed him that .the United States
desires the German declaration regard
ing armed merchant ships be modified
and that the tentative communication
designed to end the Lusitania case will
not be formally accepted by this coun
try until assurances regarding the fu
ture conduct ' of German submarine
warfare is given
In Teutonic diplomatic circles it was
stated that the Berlin foreign office
would not modify the declaration of in
tention to sink armed ships or inform
this country that previous assurances
were binding unless Great Britain
should give assurances that a subma
rine which warns a British ship car
rying defense armament would not be
fired on.

"WhyHeDidlt.",
POLICE SCOURING CITY
Burden of Chase Is Thrown i
on Sleuths of Eastern
Metropolis.
Chicago, Feb. 18. Following the
publication this morning in New York
newspapers of another letter believed
to have been written by Jean Crones,
former chef at the University Club of
Chicago, local police officials put on
the New York authorities the burden
of responsibility for Crones' arrest
Crones is charged with putting poison
in the soup served at the Mundelela
banquet.
The federal government operatives
here today continued to assist local au
thorities in tracing reports that the
poisoning was the result of an anti
clerical plot of nation-wide proper
tions. It was learned today that sec
ret service agents received warning
of such a conspiracy more than three
months ago. At that time It was re
ported that anarchistic leaders bad
been holding secret meetings at Sallda,
Colo., discussing plans for a "reign, of
terror" to be created throughout the
United States by the destruction of
churches and public buildings. It was
reported that the new $2,500,000 fed
eral building at .Darter, Col, was
among those slated Ic" , destruction.
Letters from Sallda, L,. were found
among Crones' belongings.
Officials of a correspondence school
have identified the signature of Jean
Crones on an application for their
chemistry course as the same attached
to the letters published in a New York i
paper, In which Crones confessed pois
oning soup served at the Archbishop
Mundelein banquet here last week. The '
identification removes all doubt, ac-'
cording to Captain Hunt, that Crones
wrote the first New York letter and the
captain believes he also wrote the sec-j
wind, published today. i
Letters Mailed in Jfew York. T
New York, Feb. 18. Believing that,
Jean Crones, the Chicago chef accused i
of poisoning the soup at a dinner of
Catholic clergymen and laymen In that
city, is in New York city or nearby, the
police made every effort today to run
him down. The authorities think
Crones Is the author of two letters
mailed in this city to the New York
Times, in which the writer boasts that
he has escaped arrest and makes veiled
threats.
The identification by John M. Mc
Court, assistant United States district
attorney at Scranton, Pa., of the fac
simile of the first Crones letter re
ceived here as the handwriting of the
man wanted in Chicago stimulated po
lice efforts here. Crones' writing was
identified by examination papers he
had sent to a correspondence school in
Scranton.
The second letter, apparently signed
by Crones, received by the New York
paper last night, contained what pur
ported to bs his finger prints. The po
lice are endeavoring to learn by these
prints whether Crones had a record in
the police bureau of Identification.
Attacks Social Conditions.
In this letter the writer attempted
to tell in an incoherent manner man
ner "why I did it." Many of the words
are misspelled as was the case In the
previous letter. The writer asserted
that "while at Europe millions of
Christians are schlaucbterlng each
other in the most bloddy massacre,
and in these free country thousands
of men and women are tramping the
streets without food and shelter at the
