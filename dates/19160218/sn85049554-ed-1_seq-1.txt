GERMANS ACCUSED OF PLOT.
Charged With Planning Overthrow of
French in Madagascar.
Paris, Feb. 18.—The Paris Journal's
'correspondent at Tananarlvo says that
German agents financed and otherwise
encouraged a native plot to overthrow
the government of Madagascar on Dec.
13 last. The seat of the conspiracy
was at Fianarantsoa and it was
planned to poison the French officers
and soldiers on 'New Tear's and either
gain the native troops to the cause of
the conspirators or obtain from them
military weapons. The white officials
and colonists were then to have been
massacred. The plot was revealed to
the authorities and already over 200
persons have been arrested and others
are expected to be arrested.
Tb® great bulk of the population re
'mains loyal to France, and has not
been affected by the propaganda of
the conspirators. The correspondent
adds that the documents discovered at
the German consulate show that the
plans were made for fomenting an in
surrection even before the war broke
out.
The great island of Madagascar in
the Indian ocean, lying off the east
coast of Africa, was officially recog
nized as a French colony In 1896, after
a war of occupation. The total popu
was more than 2,500,000 in 1901.

A
Capture of Erzerum
Accomplished By Russia
In Unprecedented Time
Petrograd, via London, Feb. 18.
—The fall of Erzerum, the most
important Turkish stronghold in
Asia Minor, and for a long time
considered impregnable, offers the
unprecedented spectacle of a first
class fortress built on a steep
mountain ridge, nearly a mile
above sea level, yielding to bayonet
attack aftei only thirty-six hours'
bombardment.
The operations were conducted
under the most severe weather
conditions, the snow being deep,
and- the thermometer registered
sometimes more than 30 degrees
below zero Fahrenheit.
The Turkish army defending
Erzerum, taken by surprise under
the methods adopted by the Rus
sians, is said to be in disorderly
flight on the roads leading to Sivas.
As the garrison apparently scat
tered in all directions, it Is as
sumed here that large numbers of
men were taken prisoners.
After the taking -3f Nlksala It
appeared the Russian attack would
be directed upon the Turkish right
flank, an1 by rapidly transferring
troops the Turks made all plans to
resist the main assault from this
quarter. Apparently they had
little fear of the success of this at
tack because of the strong charac
ter of the fortifications in that
direction, and even less apprehen
sion of danger from a frontal at
tack.
Nevertheless after the Russians
took by storm the first line forts
on Feb. 2, there began a persist
ent bombardment of the Turkish
center, followed ty a bayonet
charge. The highest tribute is
paid to the bravery of the Cau
casian troops, whose charge is
considered likely to go down into
history as one of the most bril
liant feats of the war.
It is recognized here that the
success of the assault was due al
most entirely to the bayonet work
of these troops, since the artillery
preparation was insufficient In
intensity and duration, according
to military experts to reduce even
a strong field position.

CHANGE OF POLICY
AN UNNEUTRAL ACT
Americans Free to Travel on Mer
chantmen of Belligerent Nationa,
Armed For Defense—To Deny Citi
zens Such Right Would Be to Court
War Would Make United States
Ally.
Washington, Fe(b. 18.—Senator Lodge,
ranking minority member of the for
eign relations committee, made a
speech in the senate today, declaring
that abandonment by tfhe United
States at this time, of the 'principle
that its ports were open to and its
citizens free to travel upon merchant
men of belligerent nations, armed sole
ly for defensive purposes, would be an
unneutral aot and a step toward war.
He sadd It would make the United
States the ally of the belligerent whose
merchant marine had been swept from
the high seas.
As late as the president's note of
May 13, 1915, signed by Mr. Bryan,
Senator Lodge said, this government
retcognized that "American citizens
were in their undisputed rights In tak
ing their ships and traveling wherever
their business calls them uipon t(he
high seae."
Practice For Two Centuries.
"Such," he added, "has ibeen the
practice of aJl nations in regard to
the armed merchantmen. It seems ut
terly incredible that this position
should foe in any way altered now, or
that our government should /be ready
to surrender the unquestioned rights
of Americans to travel or ship goods
on a belligerent merchantman, subject
to all the rules which have been es
tablished by all the courts and by all
international authorities for at leasf
two centuries. The abandonment of
those rights toy any neutral government
on the ground that the intention of
submarines, with the necessary 'limita*
tions ppon the power of ^capture (pos-*
sessed by those boats, is lnconvelv
able.
"There is,' however, another side to
this matter which is of even graver
importance. There can be po ques
tion that any act by a neutral which
alters conditions created by the war
is an unneutral act and places the
neutral upon the side of one (belliger
ent or the other.
"This is eminently true of any form
of embargo and there is no need that
I should repeat the unanswerable ar
gument on this point embodied by Mr.
Lansing in his note of last August to
the government of Austria-Hungary.
The war and the war alone has also
created conditions under which any
change at this time in tlhe afrtitude we
took officially at the outset of the war
in regard to armed merchantmen
would 'be an unneutral act
"I can not believe that the admin
istration thinks for a moment of al
tering the well defined position which
it took at the outset of the European
war and ibelieve that it must stand
as firmly on this question as it has
on the question of the embargo.'Should
it act otherwise. It would accept a hu
miliation and inour a danger of war
from which even the boldest would
shrink."
AUSTRIA TO BE NOTIFIED.
Position of United States on Sub
mar Situation to Be Made Clear.
Washington, Feb. 18.—The sub
marine situation with its new develop
ments was discussed at today's cabi
net meeting. Secretary Lansing went
to the White House before the cabi

It was indicated today that Austria

AVIATION SERVICE
CALLED DEFECTIVE
Senator Robinson Offers Photographic
Copies of Letters to Prove Conten

Washington, Feb. 18.—Photographio
copies of correspondence between offi
cers of the army aviation corps,
which Senator Robinson, of Arkansas
declared established beyond doubt the
defective condition of the aviation ser
vice were shown by him to the senate
military committee today.
A letter presented to the committen
purported to be from 'Colonel Reber,
head of the service, to Captain Cowan,
in charge at San Diego, under date of
June 2, 1915, and read:
"I wish you would have your engi
neering department get me out some
drawings for the size of sheets to bo
placed under the seats of avlatorsi for
alleged armor protection. I will have
several of these plates made so we can
say we have armored aeroplanes, not
that I think it vitally essential, but In
order that we can meet any charge
that our machines are not armored."
Captain Cowan in a letter to Colonel
Reber declared that "If the service ever
came under investigation by any one
outside our own corps It would be im
possible to explain the rotten way in
Which the' work has been handled."
Senator Robinson declared that the
defective equipment of the service at
San Diego could be established beyond
doubt and that Colonel Reber had In
structed Captain Cowan to keep it a
secret.

Control of Sisal Crop—Attorney For
Harvester Company Makee Denial,
Mayer Says He Has Evidenoe—Mex

Washington, Feb. 18—Charges that
the International Harvester Company
had furnished money for arms and
ammunition for the Ortes-Argumedo
revolution against the Carranza gov
ernment in Yucatan, Mexico, were
made today by Levy Mayer, of Chi
cago, In the senate's agricultural com
mittee's investigation into an alleged
monopoly for control of the sisal mar
ket.
N
Walter L. Fisher, former secretary
of the interior, counsel for the har
vestor company, displayed to the com
mittee a bundle of bills, part of 3,600,
000 pesos issued by the Yucatan com
mission, formed for controlling the
sisal crop. He was undertaking to ex
plain that the bills had come into the
possession of the harvester company
from a draft of $480,000 in gold issued
to Angelino iMontes, a sisal purchaser,
who the Yucatan planters asserted
represented solely the harvester com
pany, when he was interrupted by
Mayer, who declared they gave the
draft to raise money for stirring up a
revolution.
Says He 'Has Evidence.
"That's Just talk," retorted Mr.
Fisher.
"We will be able to show and In
troduce into the record the invoices
and bills showing that at least part of
the money went to an arms purchas
ing company of.New York to buy
rifles and ammunition," replied Mayer.
Mr. Blsher^asserted the money from
the draft was.given the Yucatan gov
ernment in exchange for the .commis
sion's moneyf In order to have cur
rency to pay the sisal planters.
The Ortez-Argumedo government
had control of Yucatan for a short
time ltr 1936 and was overcome by,-the
Carranza army.
Fletcher Nomination Up Soon.
Renewed discussion of the Mexican
situation in the senate and a quick
vote on the nomination of Henry P.

were forecast today as a result of
President Wilson's response to a
senate resolution calling for the facts
leading up to the recognition by the
United States of the de facto govern
ment In Mexico headed by Venustlano
Carranza.
The president's reply was submitted
in a letter from Secretary Lansing,
summarizing conditions which pre
ceded recognition of of 'Carranza. It
gave a list of seventy-six Americans
who lost their lives in Mexico in the
years 1913, 191'4 and 191'5.
Secretary Lansing in his letter said
that in the territory controled by the
Carranza government it was affording
"reasonably adequate protection to the
lives and property of Americans."
The senate foreign relations com
mittee is expected to meet next
Wednesday to take up Mr. Fletcher's
nomination.-

hundreds of thousands of dollars, said
to have been confiscated and buried by
Francisco Villa is being sought by
Mexican government authorities, ac
cording to Andreas Garcia, Mexican
consul here, who stated further that if
recovered the treasure would be for

"We have done all the work and
taken all the risk to secure it, there

American mining men Interested In
Chihuahua state properties construed
Garoia'a statement to mean that con

Garcia defended the action of the de

hua in selling for exports hides bear
ing brands of American owners, who
declared they had not been consulted
and received nothing from the sale.
"Th® o' hides or beef Is a
right of the de facto government of

Captain Hunt, Chief of Chioago De

Hesitate to Sacrifice His Own Life
to Destroy Police—New York Au
thorities Take Great Precautions
Against Attempt on Lives at Ball.
Chicago, Feb. 18.—Officials of a cor
respondence school have Identified the
signature of Jean Crones on an appli
cation for their chemistry course as the
same attached to the letter published
in a New York paper in which Crones
confessed poisoning soup served at a
banquet to Archbishop Mundelin here
last week, It was announced today by
Captain Hunt, chief of detectives. The
captain believes Crones also wrote the
second letter published today.
Crones was serious in his threats
against the police, contained in the
second letter, according to Hunt.
"I believe he is carrying an infernal
machine and that he would sacrifice
his own life to whip out any policeman
who may try to capture him," Captain
Hunt said.
The detective chief is expecting a
photographic copy of the ftrst letter
from Police Commissioner Woods, of
New York, and today received official
notice of the receipt of the second.
Safeguard Guests at Ball.
New York, Feb. lS.-JThe fact that
Jean Crones, the anarchist chef, ac
cused of poisoning soup at a dinner
given to Archbishop Mundelein in Chi
cago, is supposed to be in tills city,
caused the police today to take extra
ordinary precautions to safeguard
guests at a ball to be given In Madi
son Square Garden tonight by the
Knights of Columbus.
Governor Whitman, high city offi
cials and many dignitaries of the Cath
olic church, are expected to be pres
ent.
Detectives have been ordered to
watch every section of the auditorium
and another large detail will patrol the
garden.
The police have been spurred to re
newed activity by the definite estab
lishment of the fact that two letters,
received by the New York Times and
purporting to have been written by
Crones were mailed In Mew York. The
second letter, which was received by
the Times "last night and published to

Schmidt Is Deolsred Dead in One
Minute—Declared He Died For Lis,
and Not For Murder—Calls Exeeu*
tion Judicial Murder—Admita Moral
Responsibility For Girl's Death.
Osarfnlng, N. Y., Feb. 18. (Hani
Schmidt, former priest, was electro*'*
cuted at 'Sin# Sing prison this mOTnlng
for the murder of Anna Aumuller,
fiept. 2, 1913.
Schmidt went quietly to the detfth
chamber, accompanied by the principal
keeper and the Rev. Father Cashin, the
prison chaplain. Leaving the .death
house, he said goodbye to those who
remained.
When he entered the chamber the
guards attempted to dlreot him toward
the chair, but Schmidt gently Shook
them off and insisted upon addressing
the seventeen witnesses. The guards
desisted from their efforts and with'
Father Cashin, standing on one side
and the keeper at the other, Schmidt
said: t.
"Gentlemen, I ask forgiveness of all
those I have injured or scandalised. I
forgive all who have Injured me. My
last wish is to say goodbye to my dear
old mother."
Schmidt then seated himself1 In ths
electric chair and^the current was ap
plied three times. Within a minute he
was dead. He had spent the night up
to midnight In praying and talking
with Father Cashin and alept from
midnight to 5 o'cloek, when he was
awakened for breakfast He would
take only a cup'of coffee.
Reconciled to Fats.
Schmidt Issued a statement Thurs
day night thru his. attorney declaring*
he was "fully reconciled to die and
willingly accepted death as retribution'
for his frailties." Schmidt-'
however, that he will be .,
"lying an® not for jiii**#*^
Miss AUmuller's. death J«*«roi8»t#*
an operation, hut add^ "CM!?!
responsible for the
Ktrl'm
could not in honor drag thoaS
who took part ^ln the operation at my
solicitation."
"The court of appeals admitted thS
court below had made a grievous er
ror, the statement continued, "but
they said I admitted I had lied and.
therefore, could not get a new trial.
The court of appeals also decided on
my affidavit that I had not been In
sane at the time of my tTlal, altho the
affidavit in question was made two
years after the girl died.
'1 declined at all times to appeal' to
Governor Whitman for clemency be
cause he had been the district attor
ney who had prosecuted me and be
cause 1 wanted Justice, not clemency.*'
The doctors he called to investigate my
story seemed to miss the whole point
of my contention.
"I hope and pray that time will prove
every one of my contentions and that
my Judicial murder will help to abol-•
ish executions, for not one-third of the
men have been in the death chamber
with me, including Eeoker, w$£e guilty''V
of murder."
