AUTOMOBILE IS DEMOLISHED
Boys Did Not See Train and
Drove Car Acrota Tracks in
Front of Engine
Ope of the most horrible trage
dies that ever occurred in this sec
tion happened Saturday afternoon
about 435 oclock when the north
bound passenger train No 20
struck an automobile which had
been driven across the tracks at
Lone Star crossing about one and
one half miles north of Solomon-
villc
Two bovs Voris Buckley Hor
ene aired 15 years and Arthur
OBryan aged 12 years were rid
ing in the car the Horene boy
driving
The force of the impact threw
the OBryan boy out of the car for
a distance of 50 yards The Hor
ene boy was killed and the car
completely demolished
The train was on its way to Saf
Jord having left Solomonville sta
tion a few minutes before and
coming down the grade about 40
miles an hour The boys were
coming down the road toward the
tracks from the foothills and ap
parently did not see the train and
kept on at slow speed until within
150 yards of the track when the
OBryan boy looked up Evidently
from the track at this point the
Horene boy tried to turn the car
but for some reason which may
never be known the car went
acrossjthe track in front of thcjcn
gine
Billy Zimmerman the fireman
on the engine saw the car when
it was about 150 yards from the
tracks but thought the driver
would turn from the tracks But
when he saw the car getting nearer
he gave the signal to the engineer
who put on the emergency brakes
but the train was too close and the
car had almost crossed the tracks
when the engine struck it with
such force that it shot up in the
air about eight feet throwing the
OBryan boy out for a distance of
50 yards The car turned over
before descending the Horene boy
falling and striking with his head
on the beam post of the cow
catcher cutting a fearfull gash in
the scalp over the right side of the
head and cracking the skull down
the center of the head to the fore
head
The body was carried on the
cowcatcher a short distance when
the train stopped and the body
fell off and rolled to the ground on
the north side of the track
As soon as the train stopped
the trainmen and passengers
rushed to the front of the train
They picked up Arthur OBryan
who was unconscious The body
of young Horene was then found
and an examination gave the be
lief that he was still alive
The two boys were placed on
stretchers and carried to the train
which continued the journey to
Safford the Horene boy died on
the way
When the train reached here
the OBryan boy was taken off and
carried in the stretcher to his home
on Tenth street where he was at
tended by Drs Martin and Mc
Whirt who found that he was suf
fering from shock but no bones
were broken
The body of young Horene was
carried in the stretcher to the
Ijams building corner of Tenth
and M streets where it was viewed
by the coroners jury
Examination showed a deep gash
on the right side of the head and
the skull cracked down the center
to the forehead and scalp torn
away
The inquest was held Sunday
afternoon about 200 oclock by
the coroners jury consisting of J
R Welker L W Samuel E W
Clayton CS Conway E H Roach
and H J Dowdle
From the testimony brought out
at the inquest it appeared that the
boys in the car didtnot see the
train The fireman taSttfied that
he saw the boys when within 50
yards of the crossing but as the
car was traveling slow thought
that they were going to stop but
instead of stopping drove in front
of the train
The jury rendered a verdict that
Voris Buckley Horene aged 15
fiSi years
was killed by the Arizona
TWENTY SECOND YEAR
AROUSE PATRIOTISM
By Observing the National
Week of Song in the
Public Schools
It has been suggested that the
week of Washingtons birthday
February 21st to 26th be kept as
the National Week of Sons
This is a befitting opportunity for
us to develop in our children a pro
per love for our country and to
also restimulate in our grown folks
that feeling of patriotism which
needs rekindling from time to time
By proper observance by the schools
of the National Week of Song a
good opportunity will thus present
itself to bring parent and school in
a closer relationship with each other
Every school should have the flag
flying during the week and if possi
ble flags should be secured to de
corate the school room Encourage
parents to have flags flying at their
homes If your school has no flag
remind the clerk of the board of
trustees at once and urge that a flag
be secured as the law requires that
all schools be furnished with n flag
Also if possible have an Arizona
pennant Teach oiir children to love
this big country of ours and com
pare our State as to area popula
tion and resources with the middle
Atlantic states and some of the
European countries Teach them
about the vast amount of unde
veloped resources in our State and
the necessity of their being well
trained in order to grasp the op
portunities awaiting them
Set aside at least one half hour
each day to the singing of some of
the songs suggested herewith The
children should also be urged to get
the parents to join with them in
singing the songs at home
Would suggest that you have a
Washingtons birthday program in
viting the people of the community
to attend On Friday evening get
the whole neighborhood to join you
in having a Song Festival At
this Song Festival it might be well
to have refreshments Try and get
allto jofnln singing
For further information concern
ing The Week of Songs read
Mary C C Bradfords article in the
January number of the Normal In
structor also the February number
of the same magazine
Trusting that this Week of Song
will be observed in your district I
am
Yours truly

A New Device to
Save River Land
F N Holmquist representing the
River Current Control Co of San
Crancisco Cal arrived here Wed
nesday night from Phoenix
Mr Holmquist started yesterday
afternoon to install several Dean de
flectors on the land of Z C Prina
bordering on the Gila river for the
purpose of turning the current
away from the bank of the river
and form a new bank line
This work will be watched with
interest by the farmers who have
lands bordering on the river
The Dean deflector was success
fully installed at the head of the
Buckeye canal near Phoenix and
alsoat Roy on the Gilu rivur
bama and many others that were
known all over the United States
for their proficiency n drill work
It was these troops that whipped
the regular army at Bull Run and
came very near winding the Civil
War for the Confederacy
This is one of the greatest argu
ments for the militia and its effect
ive training
After the Civil War and recon
struction was over many of the old
companies of the South re-organized
and became celebrated all over
the world for their11 proficiency
Such companies as the Chickasaw
Guards of Memphis the Houston
Light Guard Rifles Sealy
Rifles and Trezevant Rifles of Tex
as the Mobile Rifles and Montgom
ery Greys of Alabama the Wash
ington Light Infantry National
Rifles Corcoran Cadets and Morton
Cadets of Washiggton D C and
the Thurston Rifles of Omaha
Sixty ninth and Seventy first Regi
ments of New York all were known
to be well organized equipped and
disciplined and it was such com
panies as these that gave the back
bone to the army at the time of
the Spanish American War in 1898
Our regular armyat t that time
consisted of scarcely 25000 men
and though Spain was a very weak
power it was absolutely necessary
for be militia andivlunteers o
fight this war
When the Spanish War was over
and the Phillipine insurrection be
gan the militia was in an excellent
state of preparation by reason of
their recent service in the Spanish
American War and as a conse
quence the United states was en
abled to travel across theJ Pacific
ocean invade an unknown country
and complete a conquest in less
than two years that would have
taken five years with untrained
troops regardless of their numbers
and by reason of their training the
loss by disease in the Phillipines was
50 per cent less than losses from
the same causes in the Spanish
American War when the majority
of our troops were camped in our
own country during the greater
part of the wars duration
With these facts before congress
it is not a surprise that they are in
favor of the National Guard as
against a Continental Army or any
other scheme that does not contem
plate the constant training of men
physically and mentally
As an indication of the recognized
value of National Guard training as
an aid to health the Omaha Nebr
Chapter of the American Institute
of Banking composed of sixty
bankers of Omaha has arranged
for uniforms and rifles and the use
of the National Guard Armory of
that city for the purpose of drilling
once a week as a physical benefit to
the membership s
The Safford company ot
Guard has completed the nec
essary membership and as soon as
the War Department can detail an
officer to inspect the company it
will be mustered into service and
become part of the Arizona National
Guard It is expected that this
will be done in the next week and
an active course of drills will begin
immediately and it is hoped by the
next Fourth of July that Safford
can have a real military celebration
of our national holiday
The company is meeting once
each week in Briers Hall and wel
comes all citizens to witness the
drills

FARMERS MEETINGS
Mass Meeting Held Here Sat
urday Results in
eral Organizations
The mass meeting of farmers and
business men of the valley which
was held at the court house Satur
day afternoon for the purpose of
organizing farm improvement asso
ciations was largely attended Be
sides the farmers there were pres
ent business men bankers and
members of boards of supervisors
from Gila Greenlee and this county
Prof Stanley F Morse Director
of the Extension Service of the
State University was the principal
speaker
Prof Morse explained that the
United States government is now
offering a great deal of assistance
to the farmer One of the most
successful methods is through the
seryice of the farm advisor who
in addition to being a practical and
successful farmer has also had a
great deal of scientific training and
a wide experience with other farms
and localities Such a man is to be
placed in this district and his entire
time and ability will be at the call
of the farmers
All this work and many other im
portant helps are secured by the
people through farm improvement
associations These associations are
organized in each town and the
presidentsof the town organizations
make up the County Farm Improve
ment Association which affiliates
with the State University and with
the Department of Agriculture All
this makes a very strong organiza
tion of the farmers whereby they
can get a great deal of assistance in
better farming better markets and
more profits
Immediately after the mass meet
ing a Farm Improvement Associa
tion was organized for Safford and
vicinity with the following officers
Joseph Greenhalgh and J R
