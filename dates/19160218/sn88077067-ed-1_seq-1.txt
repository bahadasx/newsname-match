nut just recently that an old copy of the
St. Marys Leader states that in 1XX1
Hon. Hen Lel'ovre procurred a consign

the German carp did not take well. Thev

of the luscious catlish and the finely flav

MEN DON TO HAVE CHAUTAUQUA
A representative of the Central Com
munity Chautauqua System, of Indlanu-
f lolls, was in our town, last week, work
tig up the Chautauqua idea among u;..
It has come to the point "where about ev
ery town has its own Chautauqua now-a
days.
This representative, asked for 20 per
sons to get buck of the project, but as
there were more names than that on tlie
paper, and still getting more, the thing is
a certainity. That means that Mendon
will be the center of attraction In these
parts for live days. Just think! there will
be eighteen numbers of a good wholesome
nature put on In that time. For instance
one will be a first class band, and there
will be splendid lectures on community
Interests. Two programs will ne render
ed each day, afternoon and ev ning. Wit'
the reputation our community has for
supporting a good thing, we anticipate
that the people will get behind this move
ment and make It a decided success.

Davod W. Bowman, in Lima Times
Democrat Candidates for the post of delegate to
;lie national convention at St. Louis are
beginning to come to the front, the first
boom being tliut of an out-and-out Wll-
(in man prepared to support the adminis
tration hi the preparedness program In
case a light develops over the Insertion
of that plank of the platform. Ho Is
Howard Amos, chulrmun of the Shelby
county central committee, son of Col. J.
G. Amos, editor of the Sidney News and
Ihe Shelby County Democrat.
lOininelt R. Curtin, of Lima, has con
scnlcd to stand as a Wilson delegute
along with .Mr. Amos. Allen county, as
the largest In the Fourth district, Is en
tilled to the representation which she
was denied In 11)12, according to friends
of Mr. Curtin, und the latter expects
to
make the race us a. supporter of the pres
Ideal throughout. As Mercer und Aug
laize have not Jet presented candldutes.
it is reported that .Miami and Dai ke will
diyide tlie alternate positions.
Dr. Gaynor Jennings, ol West Milton
is touted us the -Miami alternate. Dark,
has not yet been heard from, but as that
county is always active the chances ur
that plenty ol names win no meiiiioneu
within a few days. Tlie short time limit
ten days, offers little chance for cam
paigmug, but only live signatures in eacn
county are reiiuired. or 30 in ull.
One lact lavors .Mr. Amos above the
other possible opponents. As his name

t. the odds ure ins way. u peni" u wt
known failing of the voters to take the
t man in every case where they are
unfamiliar with all. Another factor fay
oriug mil n is that he anu Ml', i m ini ure
to stand siiuaielv on the admimsiia
lion's record, being Wilson men in ull
particulars. Any who would oppose them
must take another angle, and the Wilson
scnlinioiil is strong enough to prelude any
denunciation lroni any quarter.
The Fourth and Fifth Ohio districts,
composed of tlie Northwest tiers of coun
ties, make up the strongest democratic
section of the state. This is the basis of
Well dellned sentiment for the election
of one delegute-ut-lurgo from this section
ol the state. Itarmun, cumpbell und cox
have been mentioned, also Pomerene, but
the stale convention will tuke care of the
geographical distribution.. Ihe big four
is supposed to represent the entire stale
and is composed of tlie blgest men avail
able. This quartet is always, or nearly
always, chosen to unite ull factions and
all sections and as Northwestern Ohio is
the bulwark of Ohio democracy, there ap
pears to be a demand about the section
to force the selection of a uelegate-at-large
from either the Fourth or tlie f ilth
district.

George W. Mannix, jr., of Greenville,
is the latest addition to the list of con
grcssionul possibilities. The Durke coun

tlie same boat as each of the other as
pirants thinking It over, not ready to
announce and wanting lo see just what
half a dozen others do.
There is no doubt that he has his
lightning rod out, and his friends say he
is tlie one proposition with tiie power to
heal the split between the Murker-Muher
and the U lliams-Brow ne tactions, tor
personalities have done much to impair
the regularity witli which that county
oilers democratic majorities. I ie form

Darke county s last offering was the
late A. C. Robeson, lormerly speuner pro

the six on tlie ticket in 1010. With that
exception nothing has been heard from
that corner of tlie district since Harvey

Just how much trouble will result in
the G. O. P. ranks by the ditching of
State Central Committee Chairman Will
iam L. l'armenter is an open question",
but the repudiation of the Wapukoneta

as a bonehend play on tiie part of the men
who steered it and this with all respect
to the affable James W. Halthill. On the
same evening that saw the endorsement

counties lined up behind the state chair

quarters that the Lima crowd is groom

uring the nomination ot Hamuli, but to

though somebody was going to get even.
Hamuli s statewide posibilitles have
not been noised abroad with a mega

Firday evening has been taken In some
quarters to indicate that aim. That Wil

not totally absent in Allen county. How
many of the Lima crowd are making any
