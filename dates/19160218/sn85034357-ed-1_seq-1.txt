ESTABLISHED 1845.
WHEN WAS THE
'OLD INN' BUILT?
Indications Are That Building is
94 Years Old and Was Built
With Brick Made By Hand.
Changed Hands Often.
"One generation builds, the next
tears down." In this day of prog?
ress and new things land-marks ruth?
lessly disappear and a chapter in his?
tory closes and another begins, built
upon the ruins thereof. Tazewell is
not an "old town" in years, but there
is not perhaps a single building stand?
ing jiow that' is as old as the town.
Necessarily the first buildings erect?
ed were cheap, wooden buildings,
which have long ago been removed
and replaced by others.
The oldest building in town is said
. to be a part of the May building on
Main Street. Perhaps the next old?
est is the "Old Inn," now being torn
away to make room for another and
more modern building. The eastern
part of the Joffersonvilie hotel v^as
built in the early days of Jcfferson
yille. The pld "Julia Moore" build?
ing on Main Street is one of Tazc
well's land-marks. This building was
erected by Mr. Cox, the father of the
late Captain Cox, of Gratton. There
are a number of old, brick buildings
in the community which have a his?
tory. The George Peery residence
west of town is one of them.
The Old Brick Church.
One of the earliest brick structures
erected here was the Methodist church
which stood just south of town nnd
near the residence of Judge S. C. Gra?
ham. This building was never com?
pleted entirely. The church was lat?
er removed to what is now lower
West Main Street. In'- the church
yard of the first Methodist church
near Judge Graham's sleep the re?
mains of a number of Tazewell's pion?
eer citizens.
Who Built the Old Inn?
The writer of this sketch has gath?
ered some facts and data here and
there, and records here what he finds.
The Old Inn was built by Captain
Kobert Crockett, great uncle of our
townsman, R. O. Crockett, the attor?
ney, and a close relative of E. K.
Crockett, Charles Crockett and other
present day people of this community.
The property has changed hands fre?
quently. L. R. Dodd purchased the
property from Mr. Crockett in Sep?
tember, 1870 for ijlG?O. Dodd sold to
Wm. Li. Wutkins. Watklns sold to
A. J. May Jr., in April, 1890. May
sold to Dr.-Hufford. After Dr. Huff
ord's death, Jeff H?ge and J. W. Moss
bought the property, and Coffee ran
another hotel, H?ge and Moss sold
to J. W. and R. C. Chapman. Chap?
man sold to George: R. Surface and
Surface sold to the Methodist church
people, who recently sold to the pres?
ent owners, Witten & Steele.
Built 93 Years Ago (7)
There is this data as to when the
house was built: John P. Suthers, of
this town, says that he heard his
father, who was a carpeter, say fre?
quently that his first work as a car?
penter was done on this building.
Suthers came to Tazewell when he
was 18 years old. He died here. Reck?
oning back, he worked on this build?
ing in the year 1822, which would
make the building now about IM years
old. This is the nearest, we can come
at it and is evidenuy about correct.
Who worked on the buutlnig besides
Suthsrs, or who was the contractor,
cannot be known. Reuben L?dge,
, Ilulford and perhaps others, were
great brick layers, hut this building
was erected before their day.
Mr. Elgin Wlutley now about 83
years of age, whom the writer inter?
viewed on Tuesday, could give no help
along this line. Whoever these men
were they did their work well, as the
present condition of the wails now.
Other Data.
Mr. M. F. Wynn, who has the con?
tract to remove the building, found a
brick in the west wall which had the
number 1820 cut into it. If this date
was cut in the brick when it was laid
the buidling is 90 years old. So,
there you are. ? The date may have
been put in when the brick was made
in the yard.
THE Old Whip Saw.
Mr. Wynn says that the sills, joist,
etc., were sawed by old whipsaw and
the laths were ripped out by hand. In
those days there were no saw mills
or brick machines. Mortar for brick
was made by horses tramping and
working it up. Mr. Elgin Whitley
says, that as a boy, he rode a horse
many a day around in a brick mor?
tar bed,, and nil the bricks were made
by hand, one at a time.
The nails used in the original con?
struction of the building w?re of
wrought iron, made in the blacksmith
shop.
And so it goes. It is a long cry
from those days and methods to the
present.
In Memoriam.
In loving remembrance of Mrs. Eliz?
abeth McGuire, wife of the late Jas.
Mathias McGuire, and daughter of the
late W. D. Hurt and Elizabeth Mc?
Guire Hurt Cecil, born August 27,
1853 and depared this life January
30, 1910, at 8 a. m. in a Richmond hos?
pital where she had undergone an op?
eration for gall stones about four
weeks previous, age 02 years, five
months and three days.
Besides a host of relatives and of
friends, she is survived by four sons,
Dr. J. A. McGuire, and James W. Mc
"Guire, of Princeton, W. Va.; Marvin
H. McGuire, of Pilot Mountain, Tenn.;
and Dr. John McGuire, of Richmond;
'three daughters, Mrs. Maude L. Fu
gatc, Pilot Mountain, Tenn.; Mrs. Car?
rie Peery, of North Tazewell and Miss
Sadie McGuire, of Cedar Bulff; three
sisters, Mrs. Theresa Repass, of Ce?
dar Bluff; Mrs. Louisa McFarland, of
Blnckford, Va.; Mrs. Columbia Cecil,
of Ezel, Ky.; one brother, Mrs. Chas.
G. Hurt, of Cedar Bluff and one half
brother, Mr. William M. Cecil, of Hot
Springs, Ark., all of whom were pres?
ent nt the funeral except Mr. and Mrs.
Cecil, of Arkansas and Kentucky, re
spectively.
She was preceded to the grave by
her husband on September 3, 1894
and the following children:
Ella, October 8, 1880.
Charles M., December 8, 1894.
Mrs. Lena EJizabeth Reed, August1
10, 1898. \
Miss Mayo McGuire, June 23, 1900,
ulso by three brothers, Messrs. Thom?
as, George U. and John B. Hurt, whose
deaths occurred at or near Cedar
Bluff. She is nlso survived by nine
grand children. She was converted
at Steelc's chapel at the age of 17 and
lived a beautiful, Christian life; was a
member of the Methodist church,
South, also of tho Home Missionary
Society and Woman's Christian Tem?
perance Union and will be greatly
missed. Her death came as a shock
to ail. as she was expected home
on the following Wednesday. The
real cause of her death was the clot?
ting of an artery near the heart, and
in a few moments lifter partaking of
a hearty breakfast and walking across
the floor, complained of a severe pain
around her heart, and asked the nurse
to call her son, Dr. John McGuire, and
in a few moments life was extinct.
The funeral was held at her beau?
tiful, now lonely residence, at Cedar
Blulf at 11 o'clock on February 1st.
Rev. N. B. Watcrhouse, and B. M.
Buhrman, of Richlunds and Cedar
Blutf circuit, respectively, of the M.
E. Church, officiated. The flowers
were many and beautiful, there being
two blankets, one of Enstern lilies,
which represented so truly the purity
of a beautiful life. Besides the flow?
ers tha covered the graves of the wife 1
and husband there were flowers in
profusion, which showed the great
love and esteem of her relatives and !
friends.
The pall-bearers were Messrs. Wm.
Grinstead, John Fox, J. Ed. McGuire, :
Harry W. Bane, Chnpmnn H. Peery
and George R. McCall. Mny all of j
her children, brothers and sisters live
such Christian lives ns they can
meet her in Heaven. C. L. S. 1

MR. SCHIFF TALKS.
(Marion Democrat.)
At the banquet of the Republican
Club of New York the other day, Mr.
Jacob H. Schiff, a well known banker
of that city and a shrewd business
man who has the country's best wel?
fare at heart, said something which
Republicans generally should ponder
seriously. We quote him:
"I am a Republican-Democrat. 1
voted for President Wilson, the first
Democrat for whom I cast my vote
for President for fifty years. I want
to explain that my heart is for the
Republican party, but my common
sense makes ine a Democrat.
"I didn't .pxpect that much," Mr.
Schiff said in response to tho single
handclap that greeted his roniarks,
"but I want to explain further that
nothing can stop that great pros?
perity we have now except a renewal
of tariff agitation in the next cam?
paign.
"Standing here on holy Republican
ground, I say without fear or favor,
if you renew in the next enmpaign
the tariff agitation of the past; if you
threaten the country and show it you
want a renewal of special privilege
and high protection, the people will |
have none of it. The pepole have
1learned; the workmen have learned
and the farmers have learned, and
they cannot be misled any longer,"
TAZEWELL, VII
VIRGINIANS GLAD
GARRISON IS OUT
General Gratification Expressed1
Over Result of Resignation of
Secretary of War?Makes
Wilson's Chances Better.
Washington, Feb. 14.?The greatest
effect that the resignation of Secre?
tary of War Garrison has had upon
the President's preparedness program
has been to sotten the opposition to
it in the house of representatives and
to create a sentiment in favor of af?
fecting a compromise and quickly
putting through a bill that will satis?
fy the President.
It has also created a feeling among
the men who have heretofore strong?
ly opposed the bill and stood stunch
iy by Majority Leader Claude Kitch
iu that it is now time for the Demo?
unts to get together, and for Mr.
Kitchen to either lead the Democrat?
ic party in the. house or turn to some
one else the leadership upon this
n ensure.
Virginian Pleased Over Wilson's Con?
sent for Use of Name on Ballot.
? The Virginia delegation expressed
general gratification today upon the
?eceipt of the news that President
Wilson had consented to allow his
mine to be used in Ohio as a presiden- (
ial candidate.
It was aforegone conclusion, they
seemed to think, that, the president
vould again agree to become ncandi- j
late. Sentiment all over the country
.hey declared, is strongly in favor of
lis re-election, and he will be renomi- '
mted by acclamation, regardless of 1
vhother he puts himself forward. 1
"1 am pleased to see the president 1
las granted permission for the uao !
>f his name as a candidate for re- 1
tlection," said Senator Swanson. '"I 1
vould have been greatly disappointed '
f he had done otherwise."
Congressman Flood said:
"The Democrats of the country ami
he people of the country generally :
buna ml that the prcfident should be
i candidate to succeed himself and 1
here was no way in which he could j
iscape the popular demand, lie will 1
lie renominated without opposition,
md will undoubtedly be re-elected."
Senator Matrin and tho other Vir- 1
rinans made expressions similar to 1
hose of Senator Swanson and Repre
entntive Flood. In fact, almost every
Democratic congressman thought it
vas the proper thing for the presi?
dent to do. There were a few excep
ions. however, and two of these were '
Speaker Champ Clark and Congress- \
nan Fitzgerald, chairman of the ap
iropriations committee. ?
Speaker Clark said: "I don't know 1
inylhing about it, and I don't care 1
mything about it, either,"
Chairman Fitzgerald, who has been \
it loggerheads with the president for 1
wo years over anointments in
Brooklyn, said: "You had better get
ome politicians to discus it; I'm not 1
n politics."

AN APPRECIATION
Some one has said, "I would rath?

by a friend while I'm living, than to
have all the flowers of all tho gardens
in the world heaped upon my grave
when I'm dead."
During the revival at North Taze?
well, I referred to the above quota?
tion, and I take the opportunity of
expressing to all the people my sin?
cere thanks for their kindness to me
and my family. I canot forget the
editor for the nice things he said
about the meeting, and also my good

for me. God's richest blessings on

BUSTLE AND STIR.
It is a very common phrase among
Lhe unconverted and even some pro?
fessing Christians that "The church
lloesn't save anybody." Then, in the
name of truth, what is the church
Tor?
It cost so much to establish the
:hurcb, and it has cost so much to
maintain it, and it will cost much to
'onlinue it, and the cost is not simply
money. It costs thought, time and
lervico, cares, prayers, anil tears, love
Old blood anil life. And this enor
nous price is paid by Cod, angels and
lien. Then, if it be true that "The
ihurcll doesn't save anybody," why all
his sacrifice. Where the condemna?
tion if men stay out? Does the cburch
tanction this untruth, this slogan of
icll? Certainly not. How can any
nan who knows what the church of
lesus Christ is, or what its mission
s, subscribe to such a statement?
The church must win the world, not
ly false statements of her weakness
ind insufficiency, but by true state
ncnts of her power and sufficiency.

Sir. Editor:
For years the Anti-Saloon League
)f Virginia has been fighting for an
ihsolutoly dry state. At no time has
he League ever said that anything
ihort of that would be satisfactory,
n accepting the Map bill the League
>y no means takes it as final, but only
'or the much good that it has in it,
ind as all that can be obtained at this
ime, with the public declaration and
ivowed purpose that the fight Is still
m for a complete victory?an abso
utely dry Virginia.
1 have heard a number of people
express regrets that the Mnpp bill
vas not sweeping enough, and object
ispecially to the drug store feature
>f the bill. This bill as it now is be?
fore the Senate has been greatly im?
proved and the safe-guards thrown
irouiid the sale of liquor by druggists
>rc very drastic; in addition to these
,ve will have a commissioner of prohl
>ition, his assistants nnd the ouster
law; in view of these conditions I enn
inrdly conceive how n druggist dare
?dolutc the law, knowing that detec?
tion in one offense would suspend
lim from business nnd the second or
third violntion takes his license and
ilrives him out of the business in
Virginia. A druggist can only sell
ane-half pint and that on prescrip?
tion of a reputable physician after
he has made a physical examination
af the patient, and further the doc?
tor must make oath that the liquor
Is necessary for the patient's afflic?
tion.
Whv permit liquor to be sold for
nny purpose: First, because the en?
abling act promised that liquor could
be sold for medicinal purposes nnd in
the second place enough Sonntors de?
mand that this clause bo incorporated
in the bill, or they will defent it with?
out it.
The Mapp bill is a very long one;
few people have seen it, nnd fewer
have road it. I have read and stud?
ied it carefully and while it is not
all .we hoped it would be, it is so
near what we want, that I beg and
entreat prohibition people to stand
for it and by it with enthusiasm. Our
leaders are composed of the best and
most intelligent people of the State,
lets trust them. "Don't rock tho
boot." The fight goes on, keep the
bnnner unfurled, Virginia will be dry.
Many of the wet people of the State
hnvc suddenly become dry, a sthe dry
est among us. This hns created sus?
picion in my mind, nnd I advise all
dry people to wipe their "spccks"'and
look out. C. R. BROWN.

taken by town councils to compel the
owner of tlogs to either muzzle them
or compel owners to keep them con?
fined.
In a certain town in Virginin, four
persons were bitten by a mad dog
before he was killed. The county is
full of sorry dogs thnt should be shot
on sight, but not only the worthless

cat may have rabies, and with little
or no warning. The authorities arc
urged to Uike some steps. Twenty-six
people in the sanitariums being treat?

The colored Odd Fellows hall, mid
way between this city and Nortli Taze?
well was the scene of n fracas last
Saturday night be'ween one William
Moatman and William Webster, both
colored. Moaltman was charged with
slapping Webster and otherwise beat?
ing him up. Mayor Hnwthorno as?
sessed i fine of ten and costs, amount?
ing t) some thirteen bones. Moalt
mnn's wife, rather than seo her "hub?
by" doing manual labor on the streets,
hustled ubout nnd got up the money
and paid the fine. According to Ser?
geant Thompson, Moaltman is a man
who has no particular calling, in fact,
work is not what ho is looking for.
Tho sergennt advises that thcro aro

blacks, who spend most of ^hcir time
lonfing around, and th ,t hereafter tho
vagrancy law will bo put in force,
and th sports put to work on tho
