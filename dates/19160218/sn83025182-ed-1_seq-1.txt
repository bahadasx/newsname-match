Seldom have more dramatlo scenes

Schmidt stood before the chair, an

him, addressing the witnesses of his

"Please give my mother my last

I was going to his death for having
killed Anna Aumuller, cutting her
body to places and oastlng it into the

Through his attorney he bad issued
a statement last night denying that
he had killed the Aumuller girl and as
serting that she died from the effects

Schmidt was calm and collected as
he walked to the chair, shouting good
bye to twenty other condemned men

Father Cashln. the prison chaplain,
the guards and Keeper Fred Dorner,

WILL INSIST ON OBSERVANCE
OF THE INTERNATIONAL LAWS
Germany, though displeased by (hi*
government's delay in accepting the
Lusitania's concessions is not likely
to withdraw her last note and terms
of settlement, it is thought.
Delay of the entente allies in for
mally advising the United States of
their proposed course regarding mer
chantmen, is hampering American
negotiations with Berlin.
The joint note from the allies,
promised by British Amba^?ador
Spring-Rice, has not yet been trans
mitted.
Independent of any position the
allies may assume, however, the ad
ministration is now practically com
mitted to the demand for a pledge
from Germany that all future subma
rine warfare comply with established
International code.
The state department was today
preparing to begin an inquiry into al
