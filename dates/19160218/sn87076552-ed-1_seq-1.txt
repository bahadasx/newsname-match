From additional notes taken on the
lecture by Mr. L. P. Bailey on "Feeding-
tne uairy Cow", which was in
tensely practical, we glean the follow
ing: A balanced ration la important, but
a wider ration than formerly used has
been proven efficient; a ration of from
1-tt to 1-9 may be used; in making
the ration we should consider the
cost. When protein feeds are high
in price and carbo-hydrates are low
in price aa wide a ration as one part
portein to nine parts carbo-hydrates
may be used. Cottonseed and linseed
meal, gluten feed and brewer's or dis
tillers dried grains are the highest
carriers of grain protein: Corn, bar
ley, wheat and rye are all high car
riers of carbo-hydrates. '
Alfalfa and clover . hay, bean and
cow pea hay all are high carriers of
protein. Timothy hay, corn stover
and silage are high carriers of casbo
hydrates. Bulletins and agricultural
papers should be consulted for analy
sis of feeds.
The cow is a creature of habit and
rather particular about the quality
of feed; so it must be palatable and
can be made so by mixing two or three
ounces of salt per cow per day with
the feed, also try molasses.
Cows should be fed well duing their
dry period ao as to lay on plenty of
fat to draw from during the two or
three weeks after calving when they
should be fed sparingly and with high
coo'ing feeds such as wheat bran,
oats crop and linseed meal; this char
acter of feed should also be fed dur
ing the two weeks preceding calving.
Corn and oats chop, wheat bran, cot
tonseed meal, linseed meal and brew
ers grains are all excelent feeds,
though care shou'd be taken not to
feed more than 2 pounds of cottonseed
menl to a cow per day. As a rule one
pound of gTain "hou'd be fed for every
three pounds of milk, tho this rule
doe not sopl? to all cows. How much
fain to feed is a matter that must
r"t on the judgment of the feeder,
who shou'd stud the likes, dislikes
and needs of each cow.
fir some succulent feed
inuld be fed every day in the year.
Ronts will take the p'ace of silage and
in the summer green rouehage or pas
ture should he fed always bearing In
mind that silage is just as needful in
drv summers as in the winter.
Wednesday morning Mr. Bachtell
took up the subject of "Corn", show
ing that soil fertility is a large fac
tor in growing corrt and going into
detail concernng the planting and
growing this grain. He stated that
improvement in com could me made
by careful selection of seed; in plant
ing, the hills should be three feet and
eight inches apart, making 3241 hills
to the acre. Three plants to the hill
making 8723 plants to the- acre, witlr
one ear weignmg one pound to each
plant the yield would be 143 bushels
from the acre. Corn ahould have shal
low cultivation.
Mr. Bailey on "Bacteria in Milk"
iu iimt uacierm could De controlled
by cooling the milk to 65 degrees and
by cleanliness. Mr. Waid brought
two ssmp'es of milk from the conden-
sory which were used by Mr. Bailey
in demonstrating; the samples strain
ed through cotton showed some quite
visible results. " ,
Mr. Bachtell followed with a very
practical lecture of the subject of
manure and was in turn followed by
Mr. Bai'ev on the subject of "Testing
. Milk." Much interest was shown in
this subject; twelve samples of milk
were brought by different members of
the school and tested. The sample
brounht by Mr. Chas. Leist tested the
highest, 6.1 per cent, the other sam
p'es tested from 2.9 per cent, to 4.6
per cent. One sample of skimmed or
spparated milk testing a small frac
tion of one per cent. Mr. Bailey
showed that various conditions in
which the cow was placed, such as
changing stalls, feed and etc. made a
marked difference in the tests of milk.
. Thursday morning Mr. Bachtell
presented the subject of "Commercial
Fertiliser" recommending that for
potash organic matter be placed in
the soil; grow clover for amonia and
buy acid phosphate in some form.
Mr. Bailey on the subject of
"Dairy Barns" related his own ex
perience In building and changing cow
tables on rented farms; he also de
scribed the arrangement of hit cow
stables, with 30 inch pit directly be
hind cows,, covered with wooden slats
which keeps his cows clean and sani
tary. A gasoline engine is used to
scrape manure from this pit directly
into manure spreader. Feeding ar
anjrements are such that one man can
feed silage to 50 cows in three minutes
and bbth silage and grain to this
same number of cows in nine minutes.

Continued from last week
The lesson on Thursday morning
was given to the preparation of vege
tables, the principles being given and
demonstrated witn a number of vege
tables, especially the potato in a
variety of ways. The aiternoon was
given largely to salads, four kinds of
ja ads being prepared and served to
the pupils. Ihen followed an address
on Food Standards.
The leading thought was that all
must have ideals they wish to attain
if any progress is made.
On Friday morning Miss Sharpies
gave a fine address on Home Furnish
ings. She said we should aim to
please but not to dazzle. There are
a few principles that should be follow
ed:
1. Line. Slanting rugs do not sug
gest repose; pictures should be hung
.lat against the wall; window frames
ihould be parallel to the edge of teh
walls; table covers should be parrallel
to the edge of the table.
2. Proportions are followed in na
ture and should be in architicture;
Houses should not be top heavy, the
rooms should have proper proportions
and the furniture should be in , pro
portion to the room.
3. Color. A test of civilization.
Savagfs choose the bright primary
colors' We should choose neutral
tints' makinr one .dominant, and an.
other subordinant. Bright colors ef
fect the nerves. Blue is a cold color
and should not be used in a north
room. Yellow and red are warm col
ors but red makes a room look small
er. Green is the most restful color
and is used as the foundation color in
nature.
The best way to follow nature in
which the ground is dark, , the trees
light, and the sky light. Most rooms
are overcrowded as people do not. have
courage enough to remove superfluoos

to hasten the departure of guests.
Valuable advice was given on floor

showing advantage and disadvantages
of each. Body Brussels and Wiltens
were most highly recommended and
the audience were advised to buy (rood
rugs even if part of the floors must
ro bare. A number of samples of
wall paper and draperies were shown
nd their merits for an artistic stand
point discussed.
Balanced Rations was the subject
of Miss Horst's final address. She
iaid it is time the housewife considers
the bodily needs of the family as
nuch as the scientific farmer does
that of his stock. The five food nutrt
ents and the office of each in building
up the different parts of the body
were given. These five nutrients
should be represented, if not at every

Last week Harry Yarn ell received
a copy of an invitation and a menu
card which told how the birthday of
his cousin Barney Oldfield the great
Speed King of the World was cele
brated, January 29th, at his home at
Los Angeles, California, and which
will be of special interest to the peo
ple of Wauseon and vicinity who re
member not only the boy, Barney, but
as well his father and grandfather be

The invitation card bore the follow
ing inscription printed in gold letters:

The' Master Driver of The World.
Br Fred Inwnon Rnnks
Of all the men we see or know,
Who pass us by, who come or go,
Few ever make the world aware
They're on the earth or living there;
How few achieve great things of note
Or get beyond a chance to vote. .
Consider what it means to own
A name by every mortal known.
Some gain their fame in stateman
ship; Some ride there with the horseman's
' whip;
Some paint, some carve a noted name;
Some build or gild their way to fame;
Some fight their way, some sing their
way;
Some climb by what they write or say
And while we note how few succeed
We find 'tis not in birth nor breed.
But free life of the country boy
Of meager want and simpler joy,
Whose sinews . grow with outdoor
needs
His courage by heroic deeds;
From each as these all great men
spring
As Barney did, the Speedway King,
Who won the banner Fame unfurl
ed:
"The Master Driver of the World."
From every land great drivers come
To win the world's encomium;
Great Britian, Germany and France
And Italy nave poised the lance;
Dare-devils come with fleetest car
To meet the man with the cigar;
But none of them can supercede
Our Barney Oldfield, King of Speed.
They come and go like summer rains,
but sunshine Barney still remains
With all the records great and small,
the peerless rider of them all;
But one great record he has made
Puts other champions in the shade:
1 he only champion of renown
Throughout his life to hold his crown,
What single song records his worth?
The great pacemaker of the earth.
All people know him, near and far
And cheer for Barney's stub cigar;
They love his grimy, goggled face,
His matchless daring in the race;
But greater than his record mile
Is his great heart and record smile.

gives some idea of the scope and
value of Mr. Mikesell's services as a
voluntary observer and an appreci
ation of what Mr. Mikesell has done
for this country and for the cause
of practical scientific research.
It has been a matter of common
knowledge among the citizens of
Wauseon and vicinity that Mr. Mike
sell has for years been taking syste
matic observations of the weather
and 'recording and transmit tine
these observations to the Federal
Weather Bureau, as well as furnish
ing the monthly weather reports to
the local press: but few, if any of
Mr. Mikesell's neighbors and friends
have been aware of the significance
and extent of his observations and
the true value of the records he has
made; in consequence the publication
referred to above, comes, as a revela
tion to those who have known Mr.
Mikesell for many years and will en
able them to appreciate this quiet
unostintations fellow citizen of ours
at his true worth
Professoc Talman calls attention
to the fact that phenological obser
vations have been generally neglect
ed in the United States while in the
Old World such, observations are col
lected systematically in several coun
tries; notably in Germany, Austria,
Lngland, Kussia, and Spam; this,
says. Prof. Talman, makes the
length and completness of Mr.
Mikesell s observations at Wauseon,
Ohio, of unusual interest and value.
A brief sketch of Mr. Mikesell's
life and activities is given with em
phasis placed upon his record as an
observer. In I860 he began to be
particularly interested in the weather
and began the study of meteorology,
In 1869 he secured a few instruments
and began the systematic observa
tions which he has maintained un
til the present time with scarcely
an observation lost during a period
of 45 vears.
He continued to read extensively
in science and in history and in the
early summer of 1870 decided to en
list in the weather service of the
United States Signal Corps, just
starting under Gen. A. J. Myer, but
finally he gave up that plan. In
1875 he began the study of birds and
since 1883 he has kept a very com
plete record of the migrations of a
large number of birds. Beginning in
1884 he sent reports of bird migra
tions to the American Ornitholigist's
Union and later to the Division of
Economic Ornithology of the Unit
ed States Department? of Agricul
ture.
He was elected an associate mem
ber of Orinthologisfs Union in Nov
ember 1885.
When the Ohio Meteorological
Bureau was first organized in 1882,
Mr. Mikesell became one of its first
observers. In the Annual Report of
that bureau for 1889 he published an
article under the title of "Notable
Meteorological Events," . wherein he
eave well authenticated accounts of
important weather conditions from
the earliest settlement of Fulton
County in 1834.
His nhenological . observations
were beeun in 1883. Mr. Mikesell be
gan to keep the records for his own
satisfaction, but as he continued
came to think that some day they
might be of some use to others and
has found pleasure in keeping these
because of the feeling that thereby
he has helped to increase knowledge
of this world of ours.
We quote herewith the concluding
paragraph of Prof. Talman's refer
ence to Mr. Mikesell: "The obser
vations published m this present
supplement are but a portion of the
records that this one man has main
tained during his busy life. They
constitute one of the most complete
and reliable local records of which
we have knowledge, as to the de
velopment of plant life and the mi
erations of birds and animals. Quiet
ly, carefully, conscientiously, this
man has merely kept his eyes open
to see and systematically recorded
the movements of nature about him
year by year. He has done what
sideration of child welfare.
It has already ereated wide-spread
interest, many cities spending thous
timber, wild fruits and vegetables
and grains cultivated; also a descrip
tion of the instruments used by Mr.
Mikesell and a - half-tone reproduc
tion of a photograph of these instru
ments in place at' Mr. Mikesell's
home in Wauseon.
Asregards the utility of the data
fu.'ucjied by Mr. Mikesell's records,
Prof. Talman states that they have
been and are being used in the study
of crops and that it is the belief of
the Weather Bureau that as tabulat
ed by the Bureau they furnish rare
and closely related facts for the use
of plant physiologists and agricul
tural meteorologists.

forest trees, shrubs, and vines. Dates

H. B. BROWN.
It seems to us that Mr. Brown
overlooks some conditions that pre
vailed during both the Clinton Farm
ers and Educational Institute and
sessions of tne Extension School:
there never was a time in our know
ledge of Wauseon and vicinity when
more people were confined to their
homes by prevalent crip, than there
were during the : past and present
months, and we know . that many
were prevented from , attending both
of the above gatherings by this
coming very much interested in the
spelling contests the schedules of
which are as follows: Township con
tests must close . by April 8tliL To
each of these township-contests -each
rural school shall be entitled to send .
contestants. Each township, each villas-;
elmentary school and each vil
lage high school shall be entitled to
one contestant to the county contest
which is to be held at Wauseon May
10th. The state contest is to be held
at Columbus June 2nd.
It is hoped that each township and
each' village will offer a substantial
prize to their best spellers. A good

the best speller of the county, both
