GUNMEN KILL MAN ON STREET IN A LOCAL GAMBLING WAR

GRIFFITHS
SEATTLK approaches the municipal primary next Monday
with three rather average candidates seeking the position of
mayor. The choice lies among Austin K. Griffiths, Hi (Jill
and Oliver T. Erickson.
Seattle has met these men as candidates many times. Seattle
knows each of them like a book. Seattle has fought over some
bloody political battlefields with these candidates. But the is
sues of those battles are practically all settled sri far as the present
campaign is concerned.
True, these candidates—or some of them, at least—have tried,
by resurrecting these old issues, to get the people into a sham battle,
but the voters haven't responded to the call.
Frankly, The Star ran sec no excuse whatever for the candi
dacy of either Gill or Erickson AT THIS TIME. Erickson. as
president of the city council, is ima position fully as responsible
and important as that of mayor. He gives no good reason why his
municipal job should be changed.
Gill has absolutely no issues to offer that are worth consider
ing. He ran two years ago for vindication and got it. He an
nounced then that he would not run again. He has been fust as
good a mayor as The Star expected he would be when this paper
supported him two years ago.
< Austin E. Griffiths, alone of the three candidates, offers a
reason why he should be elected mayor. These reasohs
are worthy of the voters' attention.
As The Star sees it, none of the old issues over which
Seattle has fought are at stake in this campaign. There
should be just one issue in Seattle at this time, and that
issue should be the matter of putting our municipal gov
ernment on an efficient, economical and sound basis.
THE MUNICIPALITY Of SEATTLE IS WASTING A
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.
If Seattle were a private corporation its business could be,
and would be, managed for a million a year less than our public
officials spend.
During the past few years every successful business institu
tion has been compelled to adapt itself to new conditions. Any
Seattle business institution that has not geared itself in a more ef
ficient manner than heretofore has gone bankrupt.
Our city government alone has had none of this natural
pressure of competition forced upon it. It has gone gleefully
along, following the same old slipshod, /tap-hazard, tnoney-to
burn policy.
The Star does not believe Austin F. Griffiths can save Seattle
a million dollars a year. It doesn't believe he can save a half mil
lion, nor a quarter of a million. Hut The Star does believe that his
election will tend to bury bunk "issues," and will tend to start the
city definitely and deliberately toward the point where a dollar of
public money will bring a dollar's worth of public service.
For these reasons, The Star urges the nomination of
Austin E. Griffiths in the primary next Monday.
Voters will have little difficulty in picking three good men
for the council from among these six: Thomson, Moore, Case,
Marble, Fitzgerald and Paysse.
For corporation counsel, Thomas /•'. Murphine should be
nominated.

Seattle police are working on the

The mvatery surrounding the

Four men are believed to have had

ahots fired, four took effect.
