He Declares Consent to Dis

Humiliate the United States.
STANDS BY PRECEDENT.
Change of Rule Now Could
Be Construed as an Un
neutral Act.
WASHINGTON, Feb. IS, Ger
many nnd Austria proposo piracy,
Senator I.odgo declared In tho Sen
ate to-day. It Is Iticoncelvablo, ho
said, that the United States should
accept their plan to sink armed mer
chantmen without warning.
After citing precedents that arm
ing merchantmen for defense has
been allowed ever since tho days of
'Uarbnry plrutes, u..J to how l has
been approved by tho United States
during tho present war, he declared
that to change this policy now would
bo to commit an tmnoutral act in
favor of Germany.
Lodge and Senator Sterling spoke
on the latter'H resolution, declaring
the United States cannot accept tho
prlnclplo proposed by Germany and
Austria.
"The abandonment of tho right of'
merchant vessels to arm, or of the
right of Americans to travel or ship
cargo on these ships," he said, "Is
utterly Incredible. Such abandonment
could rest only on tho ground that
the rights of neutrals, centuries old,
must be thrown aside o that a now
instrument of maritime destruction
must not be Impeded In its work of
death and murder. Such a doctrine
Is revolting to every Instinct of hu
manity, to every principle of law and
Justice
"The merchantmen o ono belliger
ent have been swept from the seas,
Thcreforo if wc should abandon all
tho prlnolplcs for which wo havo
stood it would inako ua the ally of
the belligerent whoso merchantmen
havo been nwept from tlio ocean. P
would put us In a position of hostility
to thoso belligerents ivhoso merchant
men still sail tho seas. It would be a
stop toward war.
"For these reasons I cannot believe
tho administration thinks of altering
our well-defined position. Should It
act othcrwlso It would accept a humil
iation and Incur n danger of war from
which oven the boldest and most un
scrupulous would shrink, and there
fore such a e-ottrso as has been dis
cussed In tho newspapers seems wholly
Inconceivable."
Senator Sterling of South Dakota
upoke on his resolution to declare the
Senate's concern at the recent Ger
man naval ordei to sink all armed
aUled merchant ships. Uo kiWI the
issue brought the United Bute Its
"gravest Intel national crisis."
"Instead of yielding to tin- cU ais
nf the Germun Admiralty." caul n
"Iheli ory mrntiun should meet w.t'u

this old right of the seas we should
now ot .ill times vie with any other

At the conclusion of the ad

to-day'i announcement that the

Mr. Shonts protested against the inclusion of the letter in the record,
saying he did not think it a necessary procedure. But Mr. Colby read it,
nevertheless.
The letter related the willingness of the Morgan firm, the National

Mr. Shouts, who referred to Mr.

as "Andy." urged tho latter to hasten
back from Now Hampshire, "as the
situation requires tho earliest and
most careful consideration."
"What had you In mind," Counsel
Colby asked Mr. Shouts of tha Inter7

think It prudent to wrlto moru than
is contained In this letter.'?"
"When you read that this inurnlntf
I tried to think nnd couldn't remem

these negotiations, I suppose; but I
don't remember."
When pressed, Mr. Shunts said ho
may have meant his action In golng
to Morgan without consulting Mr.
Iielmont, who was chairman of the
Hoard.
Mr. Shonts was asked the meaning
of "slush fund." "If you are opposed
to me," he utd, "and I think you ara
vulnerable and fuse money to change
your mind, that money Is a 'slush
fund.' It Is something I wouldn't ap
