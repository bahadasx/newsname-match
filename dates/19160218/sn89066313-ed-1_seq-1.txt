Connnittec of lioy Scouts Will
Deliver Alessajjc to the
Maor on Feb. 22.
I'.ui i I ncle Sum's preparedness
program "ill ! carried out in Colum
bia ii' t Monday. An experimental
call loi help, sent out Irom the I'nited
Staler Aisenal at I Jock Island, 111., to
Davenport, la., will be relayed to all
the amateur wireless operators in the
I'nited States. This message is to be
delivered hy the Hoy Scouts to the gov
ernor of every state, to mayors, and
the newspapers. The commercial and
(iovernmeiit stations are supposed to
he out of working order and the am
ateur stations the only means
of communication. This is to
test the ability of the operators in case
of emergency.
Tliete aro three licensed wireless
stations in Columbia to assist in this
call to the colors. They are the sta
tion of the physics department, of
which V A. Hunt, assistant in physics,
is operator: the station owned by K.
A. White, instructor in English, and
the station owned by Lawrence Stew
art, son of Dr. O. M. Stewart of the
physics department. If all goes well
the message should be heard from four
stations Daenport, Springfield, 111.,
the Iowa State I'niversity at Iowa City
and Washington rniversity at St.
lxmis. There are about ten receiving
stations in Columbia that may hear
the message, but only the three
licensed ones may assist in the relay.
Only sending stations aro required to
have a license and a licensed opera
tor in charge.
(.'m eminent Issues Licenses.
The licenses ate issued by the bu
reau of navigation of the Department
of Commerce. An applicant for a li
cense must pass an examination in the
laws regarding wireless and the Morse
continental code and be able to receive
five live-letter words a minute. The
officer at the nearest Government sta
tion gives the examinations. The ap
plicants in the Columbia territory are
examined by the officer of the Govern
ment station at Fort Leavenworth,
Kan. The amateur is restricted in his
use of power and his wave length.
The experiment station, such as the
one in the Physics Iiuilding, has more
freedom in the use of power and wave
length. This is the only countiy
which permits amateurs to operate
licensed wireless stations. There are
."..000 in the I'nited States.
I.awrenco Stewart of Westmount has
had his station about two years and
has probably talked to more stations
than any of the other operators in
Columbia. lie has a sending range of
J'OO miles. He has sent messages to
the North Dakota Agricultural College,
"Hl miles: West Lima. Ohio, ".00 miles;
Whitewater. Wis., 400 miles; .Milton,
Wis, :;.-.o miles, and Christian Broth
ers' College. St Louis. 12.". miles.
Hears .Message From Brazil.
Young Stewart has heard stations in
ttrazll and Chile and often gets the
messages sent to ships. He frequent
ly hears the press news sent over the
count rj He is not allowed, however,
to gie out any of the news that he
may hear.
Every night, from 7 o'clock until 12
o'clock, the amateurs work. Law
rence usually spends the week-ends at
his station, sending and receiving mes
sages it is in the basement of the
house, the situation causing the in
strument to be more sensitive. The
aerial pole is fifty feet high. Law
rence is a member of the American
Itadio Helay League and the Wireless
flub of the Fniversity.
The l!o Scouts will deliver to the
mayor the message that is received
n Columbia February 22. A boy from

"Lincoln and Missouri" Published.
The January number of the MIs
"ri Historical Review, published
quarterly by the State Historical So
My of Missouri, has just been issued.
Tl'e leading article is "Lincoln and
Missouri," hv Walter H. Stevens.
Mrs. Emily Hockaday Wells, widow
of the late Colonel Henry C. Wells,
died at noon today at the home of her
daughter, .Mrs. T. O. Robinson, 1213
Hroadway. She was S2 years old.
.Mrs. Wells was born In Callaway
County, May :!, IS";!, one of sixteen
children of John and Evaline (War
ren) Dyer. She united with Old Aux
vasse Presbyterian church at the age
of 1 1 years. She married March .".,
isr.fi. Her husband, for years propri
etor of the F'owers House, died in Co
lumbia suddenly October 12, ISilS.
Since his death Mrs. Wells had for
seventeen years mane her home with
her daughter, Mrs. Mary Wells Robin
son, wife of T. O. Robinson, a Broad
way merchant. This home was for
several years at Centralia, but more
recently in Columbia.
Five children were born to Mrs.
Wells two who died in infancy; two
sons, James and John, who died in
manhood, and one daughter. Mary,
survives her. Mrs. Wells, though
feeble, was in excellent health until a
few weeks ago when an attack of grip
added to the infirmities of age, caused
illness and death.
Mrs. Wells will be best remembered
as the mistress of the Powers Ho-
long the leading hotel of Columbia.
Here she presided with dignity ana
graciousnes.i. Here she sought m
every way that genuine Southern hos
pitality and kindliness could suggest
to make a home for her "boys" as
she was fond of calling them towns
folk and traveling men who were
guests at the hotel. Her interests
were ever in home and church and
charity. She railed, on occasion, in
good-humored way at the aggressive
spirit of modern feminism. She would
reform the world by mothering men.
Of striking personality, a Southern
gentlewoman in very truth, she re
tained until the last her generous in
terest in the many friends in Calla
way and Boone county whom she had
won during a long, useful and unsel
fish life. She was a faithful member
of the Presbyterian church for more
than seventy years.
Her funeral, at the residence of her
daughter, at 3 o'clock Sunday after
noon, will bo conducted by the pas
tor of that church, the Rev. W. W.
Elwang. Burial will be in the Colum
bia cemetery.
The pallbearers will be John Samp
son, Joseph Paxton. E. M. Watson, W.
R. Nelson, Newton Hickman and Dr.
Hugh K. Stephenson.

Plans submitted by C. L. Brewer,
director of athletics, for the erection
of a grandstand and bleachers around
the new baseball diamond on the south
part of Rollins Field, were adopted at
a meeting of the Committee on Inter
collegiate Athletics last night. These
plans will complete the three years'
work on the new south field which is
designed primarily for intramural ath
letics.
Specifications for the new grand
stand provide for a frontage of C5 feet,
beginning at the northwest corner of
the south field and extending around
home plate. The stand will be con
structed of wood, with a roof support
ed by iron posts, and will have a ce
ment foundation. It will be twelve
rows high and the rear will extend
120 feet. Folding chairs will be used
in the stand.
Nine sections of the wooden bleach
ers now on the north side of Rollins
Field will be moved to the west side
of the new field. Both the grandstand
and bleachers will be well-built and
permanent.
Three entrances will be provided
for the grandstand. The stand and
bleachers together will have a seating
capacity of 2,300.
Work was begun this morning on
the assembling of materials for the
new improvements. It is believed that
the stands will be finished not later
than April 10.
"The completion of the new south
field will give the University one of the
best play-fields in the West," said Mr.
Brewer today. "The work on this
field has been under way for three
years and the total cost of grading,
drainage, fencing and the new stands I
will approximate $12,000. This entire'
sum will he taken from the athletic
fund surplus.
"We intend that the new field shall '
be used primarily for inter-class ath
letics. It will provide an athletic
field for the use of the entire student
body. Baseball is the only intercol
legiate sport for which the new field
is to be used." .
Besides the baseball diamond, the
south field contains two complete foot
ball gridirons and a field for soccer.

He said that It

er's private papers by the doctor's rel
jatives and that he did not care to
(make it public at this time.
Xeiv Theory Advanced.
People in Centralia who know of
the letter say that it warned the phy
sician that lie had better leave town;
that he might find to Ills disadvan
tage if he remained. There are also
persons in Centralia who say that
Iialdridge and Doctor Cooper had had
trouble before the shooting. This is
in contradiction to the first belief that
I the morning of the shooting was the
I first time that the men had ever had
'any difficulty.
, With Prosecuting Attorney Dinwid
die and his assistant, J. S. Rollins,
busy gathering evidence in the case,
Baldridge, the accused officer, is at
liberty, on -W.OOO bond. He left here
Wednesday for Centralia, but it was
learned that he did not Intend to re
main long in his home town, where
there is strong sentiment against him.
"I expect he will spend a couple of
weeks visiting his brother in Kansas
City," said E. C. Anderson, his attor-
1'iity, this morning.
"The charge of first-degree murder
against Baldridge has never been
changed," Prosecuting Attorney Din
widdie declared this morning in speak
ing of the reports that the charge had
been changed to second degree.
Explains Release on Bond.
Mr. Dinwiddie explained the fact
that Baldridge, accused of first-degree
murder, had been freed on bond, by
saying that the facts in a case, rather
than the charge, decided whether a
person was bailable.
In Section 24, Article 2 of the Con
stitution or Missouri, under the Bill
of Rights,. it is stated that "all per
sons shall be. bailed by sufficient
sureties, except for capital offenses
when the proof is evident or presump
tion great."
Four of the best-known citizens of
Centralia, three of them reputed to be
wealthy, signed their names to Bald
ridge's bond. They are J. H. Starr.
