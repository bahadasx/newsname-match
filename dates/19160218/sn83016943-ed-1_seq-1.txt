Bryan's Criticism.
In this free and enlightened
country any one has the right to
say what he thinks. . The freedom
of thought is declared in our nat
ional constitution. Sometimes we
abuse the privilege of speech.
Sometimes we talk too much.
Sometimes we say things that aft
er a moment of serious thoucht
vre regret that we have said.
Down in Florida, on his grape
fruit farm, Col. Bryan is a dan
gerous man, but if he follows the
instincts of the animals, and we
are all of us or more or less resem
ble the animal in many ways, he
will not stand on his own dung
hill and bay at the moon, but he
will come out in the clear and
fight as nature intended men and
animals to light.
Col. Bryan is opposed to the
presidential policy of prepared
ness. He is opposed to auythiug
that President Wilson may recom
mend. Col. Bryan did not do
himself any good when hequitthe
diplomatic ship at a stage when
everything was dangerous. At
the time he left the cabinet ood
row Wilson was handling the grav
est situation. lie needed the help
and co operation of every friend of !
the nation. Ihi3 was the time
when Col. Bryan quit. His con
science may have justified the act.
The nation hates a quitter, and
cannot justify his conscience.
Col. Bryan is now satisfied to
sit comfortably an his grape fruit
farm and speiik in beautiful rheto
ric about the faults in President
Wilson's policy.
This must be remembered, Pres
ident Wilson has the cause of the
government to account for. lie
has pledged the people for peace.
He will be held responsible in case
of war. "We do uot think for a
moment that war is possible, but
we must agree with President Wil
son that war is liable to occur at
any time, and the best thing is to
be prepared to meet the crisis
whenever precipitated.
Our southern brothers do not
realize the danger. If they vill
reckon back to our fathers' days
and recollect that the south en
tered into war totally unprepar
ed, and think of that magnificent
fight they made they will consid
er differently about the fore
thought and comprehensive view
that President Wilson takes of
the national situation. Commer-
cial-Appeal.

Cibbens-Douglaaa.
In the presence of the immediate
family and a few close friends assem
bled at the Douglass 'home, near Vin
Dome, the marriage of Miss Annie M.
Douglass and Mr. Ernest Gibbens, of
Allenville, was solcmizcd Wednesday
afternoon, Jan. 19th, at 5:30 o'clock,
the bride and groom leaving immediate
ly on the west bound train for New
Orleans and other western points. '
Miss Annie M. Douglass is the daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. C. T. Douglass, of
Van Dome, a very prominent prairie
farmer and stock raiser, having been
connected for a number of vears with
Mr. Reynolds in the management of
the Cotton Wood plantation near Allen
ville. Mr. Ernest Gibbens came to this
section from his home in Kerrville,
Texas, about two years ago in the em
ploy of the Alabama Polytechnic Insti
tute to conduct beef cattle experi
ments on the farm of Mr. B. M. Allen
at Allenville.
Mr. Gibbens is a graduate of the A.
and M. college of Texas-class of 1914
and a most estimable young man
in every respect. To quote the state
ment of his employer: "A man high
in the agricultural department of the
state." It would be a difficult matter
to find a man his superior in any of the
attributes which go to make character
and manhood mentally, morally or
physically. His work has been very
thorough and satisfying to his employ
ers, and all who know him predict a
brillant, successful and useful career
for h'.m.

Mayor James G. Horton.
No opponent announcing against him,
Mayor Horton will next January begin
his fourth consecutive term as Mayor
of Macon. Under his administrations
all the sidewa'k paving, except tint on
the westside of Main street, has been
put down, and the asphalting of the
street to che depot, part of Main street
and the street leading to the cemetery
effected. The' city water works and
electric plant has been greatly increas
ed in tfficiency and product, and is now
on a sound and pay in ' ws s a busi
ness proposition. The sinking fund of
the city has been increased from ?ii.5t)0
to $2 ,000, ai.d now brings in an an
nual income of about $1,700, against
$170 when he first entered office.
This physical growth and improvement
of the city under his administrations as
mayor is a matter of great and pardon
able pride to Mr. Horton. He has been
a loyal, efficient and able public serv
ant and constantly worked for the bet
terment of the city which has thrice
honored him by electing him its chief
executive officer and lakes pleasure in
so honoring him again.
Another great improvement that has
taken place in Macon since Mr. Ilor
ton's incumbency as Mayor has been in
the matter of law and order. It is be
lieved that no city in Mississippi is
more orderly and law-abiding than Ma
coi i.ow is. Aii iniuxicatuiTTiian is
never seen on the streets, nor profani
ty heard there, and blind tigerism is
reduced to a minimum.
Of course Mr. Horion nor his friends
claim all the credit to him for the
things above set out, but it is believed
that in the upward and onward pro
gress Macon has made in the last five
years, His ll.-nor, The Mayor, has been
an active, strong and leading factor, a
belief that is shared by the great ma
jority of the people of Macon. '
High Honor to Noxubee.
Noxubee's distinguished record in ed
ucational matters has been honorably
maintained and increased by one of her
brilliant daughters, as will be seen by
the following report of the scholarship
committee of the Federated Women's
clubs of the state. This award places
upon Miss Augustus the distinction of
being the most scholarly woman in
Mississippi, a distinction well deserved
and worthily won:
To the l-'ederation Clubs of Mississippi:
After carefully considering tne ap
plications for the Hebron scholorshio,
your committee has awarded same to
Miss Annie Augustus of the depart
ment of English of the State Normal
college at Hattiesburg. Miss Augustus
claims Macon as her home. Some years
ago she graduated with honor from the
I, I. & C and pursued her studies
further at the State University, re
ceiving the M. A. degree. She was in
structor at three summer sessions and
has taught four years at the State Nor
mal. In 1910 Dr. Bishop said she was
the best equipped scholar in English the
University had turned out since his
connection with the institution. We
believe Miss Augustus will win other
laureU at the University of Chicago
and reflect great credit upon the Fed
eration and the State. It is gratifying
to know that in her position at the
State Normal she w'ill bring back to
those in training the newest and best
idea3 in teaching. Those other fortu
nate teachers who have held this schol
arship are now teaching in the Indus
trial Institute and College, and we are
glad the Normal College is coming in
f jr its share of the benefit too.
