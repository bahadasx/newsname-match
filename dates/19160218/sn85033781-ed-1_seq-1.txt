Adrian Fencing
A cheap pig fence will catch the eye, but it won't hold the pig.
A dog could run against many of the advertised hog fences and bend the wires.
What's a No. 15 wire against a pig who is itching to get on the other side. It would
make good chicken fence if the wires were close enough together. When it comes to stop
ping hogs you want a real fence. Those who expect something for nothing, usually get
nothing and pay almost as much as the good article costs.
We will not offer for sale any of this cheap fencing, but we do expect a sample roll
soon, ordered for your inspection. We want you to see how it's made. We want you to see
why it's sold cheaper. You can see yourself after a minutes inspection.
Compare it with the ADRIAN notice the locks, measure up the spacing, put a wire
guage on each fence. You can see that when ADRIAN is put up, it's up to stay.
One fence is made to turn stock; the other just to sell.
The ADRIAN hog fence with 6 inch stays, until March 1st.
28 cents a rod
y With wire rods advancing $2 a ton every few days, you must not expect the price to
remain at this figure.

and belter because of bis presence in it."
A Christian citizen, second to none,

successfully that tine combination of
religion and life.
He was unsurpassed in bis love of
youth, and in his passionate eagerness
and centering 1 tforts for tbe things that
advance the moral, social and education
al standards of the community in which
