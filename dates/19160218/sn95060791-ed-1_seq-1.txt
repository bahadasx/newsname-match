Booze May Be Brought In
That one' may bring liquor
into the state of Arizona for
personal use was held by the
' personal USe : Trial Jurors Drawn
"From what has been said, Last Saturday afternoon
it must not be understood in open court a list of 48
that the mere claim that in-1 jurors were drawn for the
supreme court last Saturday , toxicating liquor .has been term of superior court which

The list follows
gainst the state, respondent,
from Yuma county. The de
fendant had been tried for
introducing a bottle of wine
across the line at Yuma
His demurrer on the ground
that the liquor was introduc
ed for his personal use was
overruled. At the trial he
sought to prove that the
liquor was brought in for the
purpose, but proof was de
nied. That was held to be
error and the case was re
versed and remanded for a
new trial.
After quoting section 1 of
the prohibition amendment,
the court finds that three
crimes are defined and de
nounced: The traffic in in
toxicating liquors, the man
ufacture of intoxicating liqu
ors, and introducing or at
tempting to introduce intoxi
cating liquors.
Coming: to the cniei issue I
in the case, the court says:
"The appellant sought to
show, by evidence, that the
liquor with which he was
charged with introducing in
to the state was for his per
sonal use, upon the theory
that the prohibition amend
ment to the constitution does
not denounce or define per
sonal use of intoxicating liqu
ors as a crime. He contends
that it is not unlawful in this
state to have in possession or
to drink intoxicating liquors;
that the Webb-Kenvon act
does not divest or attempt to
divest intoxicating liquors of
their interstate character
when shipped, transported or
introduced into the state
from without the state to be
possessed or used for a law
ful purpose.
"Search the prohibtion a
mendment as you will, there
is no suggestion or intima
tion in any form contained
therein, prohibiting the pos
session or individual con
sumption of intoxicating
liquors in Arizona. - Indeed,
it was freely admitted upon
the argument by counsel who
appeared as amici curio that
it is not a crime to possess
or drink intoxicating liquors
in Arizona, and while the at
torney general, at least in
his brief, insists that the use
or possession is a crime, he
fails to cite us to a single in
stance where a prosecution
has been begun in any coun
ty of the state against any
person for drinking intoxicat
ing liquors or having it in
his possession."
After passing upon other
phases of the trial in the
lower court, the supreme
court adds the following,
rather for the guidance of
those who may hasten to
avail themselves of the privi-
tion. Any one bringing in
toxicating liquor into Ari
zona from outside the limits
of the state does so at his
peril. Whether he subjects
himself to punishment or not
depends on the use to which
the intoxicating liquor is in
tended to be put. If the
jury, under approriate in
structions as to what use
would be a violation of the
law of this state, are con
vinced beyond a reasonable
doubt from all the evidence
and circumstances in the case
that such intoxicating liquor
is intended by any person in
terested therein to be "re
ceived, possessed, sold, or in
any manner used," in viola
tion of any law of Arizona it
would be their duty to con
vict.
If the use intended violates
no law in this state, then no
offense has beencommited."

Large Crowd at Ball Game
A large crowd of people
assembled at the ball park
last Sunday afternoon to
witness the opening game of
the season. The game was
a contest between two local
teams, the Regulars and In
surrectos. The score was 16
to 15 in favor of the Regu
lars. The lineup of the two
teams was as follows:
Regulars: Pitchers, E.
Gardner, H. Carpenter; c,
E. Mineer; lb, J. Patterson;
2b, L. H. Burke; 3b, Cahoon,
Calvert; ss, H. Carpenter;
If, Q. Gardner; cf, C. Woods;
rf, E. Carrón.
Insurrectos: Pitcher, J.
Overson; c, W. Brinkerhoff;
lb, 0. Marty; 2b, C. Gard
ner; so, J. bnider; ss, L. Z.
Bates; rf, L. E. Bates; cf,
D. McLaws; rf, L Bates.
Umpire, C. Osborne.
Considering the fact that
none of the players had any
practice, the game was a
good one, and it demonstra
ted the fact that there is
good material here for a
splendid team. With the
proper encouragement and
support there is no question
but that a championship
team can be developed, and
a number of games can be
arranged with outside towns.
Another game between the
same clubs has been called
for next Sunday at 2 p. m.,
and it is hoped that the at
tendance will be large; also
that all who witness the
game will pay 25 cents for
the privilege whether they
take seats in the grandstand
or not.
The Holbrook band was
on the ball ground last Sun
day and rendered some very
creditable music. The band
will play again next Sunday

hence they watch closely for fin
ish and quality.

Severe Cold Quickly Cured.
"On December first I had a
very severe cold or attack of the
grip as it may be, and was near
ly down sick in bed," writes O.
J. Metcalf, Weatherby, Mo. "I
bought two bottles of Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy and it was
only a few days until I was com
pletely restored to health. I
firmly believe that Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy is one of the very
best medicines and will know
what to do when I have another
cold." Obtainable everywhere.
Field Notes from the Office of the
County Engineer
Material has been ordered for
the repair of the bridges which
were damaged by the recent
floods. Until this arrives pre
paratory work has been delayed.
Surveys of the several changes
in county roads made in 1915
have been taking the attention
of this office for some time.
The roads are now in excellent
condition, perhaps never before
in better, and will no doubt re
main so until the next rains.
The only exception to this is in
the mountains.
The drags have done excellent
service within the past month
and when the new road tractor
and machines arrive this county
will be well equipped for do
ing more and economical work.
The advertisement for the sale
of bridge bonds will appear early
in March.
The disbursement of the coun
ty road funds for 1916 for the
i - i i ,
airrerem county roaas win ap
pear under the proceedings oí
th Board of Supervisors.
Ihe economical location of
bridges is the most important pre-
íminary work for their construc
tion. The county engineer will
gladly meet with the people of
the different localities concerning
this matter.
