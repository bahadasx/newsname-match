STATE FIELD LIBRARIAN
WRITES.
Lois Spencer Desires to Straighten
Out Matter Concerning Recent
Visit Here.
Two weeks ago the Lkadbk re
ceived a number of items from a
friend among which was one that
spoke of the visit of the state tield li
brarian which some one tried to make
out was a "knock" against the library
by this paper, even going so far as to
send Miss Spencer the clipping. She
says newspapers and libraries are al
ways good friends and they know
they caii always depend upon them to
boost any good thing. Since the li
brary was opened the writer has giv
en at least 35 books and there is no
one in Canton that wishes more to
see this public Institution prosper
than we du. Miss Spencer's letter fol
lows:
Pierre, S P., Feb. 11, 191(.
My first Impression, as 1 came up
to the library from the street, was
one of pleasure in the attractive ex
terior of the building. As 1 entered I
was charmed by the inviting openness
or the rooms, the low desk, and good
lighting. My professional eye Im
mediately grasped the advantages in
supervision, and convenience for work.
Miss Gehon, the librarian, was at
tending club meeting that afternoon,
as she should have been, since an im
portant part of a librarian's work
must be done outside the walls. I
took advantage of this time to look
over the books o,n the shelves, and
found a most excellent collection,
both in the adult sectionand the chil
dren's room. The little group of
books for youngest readers set off by
themselves Is a point worth mention
ing.
The building has been planned with
good opportunltes for expansion. As
the work grows more books are need
ed. It is well to have the shelves
planned so that there are places for
them. No library ever has too many
books, unless there are too many of
the trashy kind, and of that sort Can
ton is happily quite free. In the ear
ly stages of the development of a li
brary two things are essential, a good,
enthusiastic, self-sacrificing librarian,
and all the money for books which can
possibly be had. The good .librarian
sees that the right books are pur
chased and used. Canton has done
splendidly in these matters In the
two years of existence.
There Is, moreover, a good collection
oooooooooooooooooooooooooo
of magazines both for current reading
and for reference. This Is a founda
tlon for one of the most Important
departs of public library work. Our
Ideal Is to make the libraries of South
Dakota continuation schools, free to
all. Libraries are often spoken of as
the "Poor man's university." Miss
tie hon can give you Bgures at any
time on the amount of reference work
being done now In the library.
Canton has occasion to be proud of
her library, but It will take more
than pride to make it grow as it
should. It is the duty of every citi
zen to boost for the library, to use
the library, and give it the moral and
financial support which such an edu
cational institution needs.
County Officials Have a Surprise
Party at Worthing.
Last Saturday evening States At
torney A. H. Carlson, Sheriff Clias.
Kundert and his deputies A. J. Tate
and Tlios. Thackery sprung a neat
surprise on a bunch of Wcrthlng men
who were indulging In a quiet game.
The officers were entirely unexpected
and walked right in and took every
thing in sight needed as evidence,
even about 9100 in cash that was on
the table. ). Crogan was arrested for
operating a gambling place, S. II.
Curts who ownes the building and
was in the game was also arrested as
well as Casey lvraayenbrink who was
charged with selling intoxicating li
quors, and brought them all to the
county seat where they will probably
"get thelr's" at the coming term of
court.
Protect The Birds.
"It has been estimated," says Presi
dent Perisho of State College, "by
the U. S. Department of Agriculture,
also by Investigations In Iowa, that
one field sparrow will eat one half
ounce of wead seed a day an astound
ing amount for a season. It has also
been calculated that one quail is
worth from $10 to $20 a year to any
farmer who is fortunate to have this
bird on his land. The prairie chicken
is still more valuable as an insect de
stroyer. Professor Severin of our en
tomology department has stated that
each year fully ten per cent of all our
grain crops in South Dakota is de
stroyed by worms, grubs and various
Insects. To prevent this millions of
dollars of waste annually our farmers
could easily afford to feed and pro
tect during the winter months the
weed-seed and insect-eating birds."

THE PAPER with the
A PRIZE SKATER.
Canton Young Man Wins Medals in
Skating Contests in Minneapolis.
Had it not been for one of our busi
ness men we probably would never
have heard of a nineteen year eld Lin
coln county boy who went to the
Twin Cities last week to enter the
skating contests held by the Minne
apolis Park Commission on the Lake of
the Isles the young man being reluc
tant In speaking of himself.
Trygve Larson, who makes Iiis
home with Mr. Holter, south of this
city and who came from Norway
about two years ago is the young man.
The Minneapolis people knowing ok
some of his work on skates in Norway
invited him to come there and par
ticipate in the contests which lie did
with much credit to himself. His
specialty is in the longer distances.
Out of 52 entries in the three mile
race he finished third In less thai.. 1:32
and nearly beat the record of i:.'il:20
which has stood since 189: For this
he received a handsome bronze medal.
There were thirteen entries iu the
25 mile race and the world's record of
1 15 was broken by the winner, a
man 42 years old, and Mr. Larson also
won the third prize, a bronze medal,
in this race, The Sunday Journal had
a picture of him only a few strokes
back of the head man.
The Northwestern Speed Associa
tion of which Mr. Larson is now a
member is holding these contests
every year and we will no doubt be
able to tell next year of even better
time made by the local skater. He
was one of the contestants in the ski
tournament last year.
Good Seed Corn.
EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS
PIERRE, SOUTH DAKOTA
A
PROCLAMATION BY Til« ÜOVKBNOR.
Whereas, much of the 1915 corn crop
did not fully mature, is of light
weigh and Inferior quality and, as
a cotisequence, unfit for seed and
Whereas, this condition makes the
selection of seed corn for the season
of 1910 a matter of unusual import
ance to the people of the »täte, as
good seed is absolutey, essential to a
full crop
Now, Therefore, I, Frank M. Byrne,
Governor of the State of South Da
kota, do hereby declare and proclaim
that the week beginning Monday,
February 21, and ending Saturday,
February 26, shall be known as
SEED CORN WEEK
and I admonish and urge farmers to
give, during that week, Icareful at
tention to their seed corn supply for
the spring planting. This proclama
tion is Issued to remind those inter
ested of the seriousness of. .the condi
tion, and to name a particular time
during whlcn attention throughout
the state .mayi.be centered on the
question. I am reliably informed
that In many instances the seed corn
supply secured and supposed to be
good is proving on examination to be
valueless. This is true to.such an ex
tent that there is grave danger that
many people will be seriously disap
pointed in their 1916 crop unless
every precaution is taken to make
sure that the seed planted is of good
Quality. I trust that during the
week named the seed corn supply
may be carefully examined and tested,
and prompt measures taken to secure
the seed needed of the very best qual
ity. In this connection it is well to
remember that other things being
any where near equal, home grown
seed, seed grown in the near locality,
is much better and safer to plant
than that imported from elsewhere.
I especially ask and urge seed men
and seed houses to make very sure
that the corn they offer for sale to
the farmers for seed be of perfect ger
minating quality and suitable for the
locality where it is sold. I venture to
express the hope that all those inter
ested, indirectly as well as directly,
In a first class corn crop for 1916, will
lend encouragement and aid in this
Important matter.

Are You Patriotic?
If we are not mistaken It was Gold
smith that said
"Such is the patriot's boast,
where'er we roam
His first, best country, ever is at
home."
There is need of more patriotism
right here at home and the Women's
Relief Corps and Grand Army are do
ing all In their power to increase It
and they now oiler a chance for all
patriots to make a demonstration of
their love for the country by attend-
George Washington
lng a program to be given celebrating
the anniversaries of the births of
Washington and Lincoln on Tuesday
afternoon, Feb. 22. at 2:30 in the
Opera House under the direction of
these two societies.
Judge Asa Forrest will deliver an
address, there will be singing, music,
drills, readings and recitations by the
College, High School and grade stu
dents and followed by a two reel mov
ing picture show. College and Public
Abraham Lincoln
School students will be admitted
free, while all others will be charged
15 cents admission to help defray the
expenses.
This is not to be a money making
affair, its object solely being to pro

your patriotism on next Tuesday af

SKI TOURNAMENT.
Fine Day Brings Out an Immense
Crowd to this Annual Event.
Last Monday being the date set for
the annual ski tournament given un
der the auspices of the Augustana
College Athletic Association a crowd
of about 1200 gathered at the big hill
on the Thorson farm east of town to
witness the sport. The lilll was lined
with spectators and many of the trees
along the course held good loads of
younger people and the flat below was
packed with Dobs and cutters tilled
with those who did not want to stand
in the snow.
Many hard falls were sustained by
the entrants in the contests but no
hones were broken which was a won
der when you think of a man or lady
going down the hill at express train
speed and lumping off a blulT and
sailing through the air ninety feet or
more and then striking the ground

grown products coming to America. Any effort to minimize this economic!
waste ought to be encouraged.
But as a farmer and friend of the manufacturer and merchant I want toil
suggest an "Advertise It in America" movement. The manufacturer and
jobber may blow loud blasts on the horn of patriotism but if they will put)
an "ad" in the newspapers in their trade territory, making a business presen-j
tation of their goods, they will find it far more effective than waving the!
Star-Spangled Banner. The farmer is as much interested in the price of the
things he has to buy as in the price of the things he has for sale and the
advertising columns of his newspaper are his price list. The price is the thing
and the farmer wants the figures in cold type. The politicians give him all
the patriotic buncombe he cares for. Business enterprise is a far more suc
cessful salesman than business patriotism.
There are many most worthy organizations working to promote commerce!
and trade but we seldom find organized effort to promote the press, yet it is
recognized as the most powerful agency for progress the world has ever pro
duced. We have all sorts of days calculated to promote business and honor
Industry such as Trades Days, Bargain Days, Labor Days, etc. why not
have a press day and all business concerns advertise the things they have
to sell and everybody subscribe for the local paper and all delinquents pay a
year in advance? There Is nothing so elevating in civilization as the smile
of an editor and nothing will contribute more toward the welfare of a com
munity thaq^the prosperity of the press.
The farmer is a friend and patron of the newspapers. He subscribes for
the local paper and reads every line in it and it Is the best investment he'
can make. There is no news so valuable as store news no information so
interesting as market demands no tragedy so entertaining as the rise and
fall of prices and no page more closely studied by the farmers than the adver
tising columns of the press.
