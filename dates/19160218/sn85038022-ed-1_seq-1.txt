At the last meeting of tho City
Council tho matter of paving KaRt
Second street, among other streets,
camo up for consideration. Tho City
Council decided to pavo East Second
street with brick from tho brldgo to
Union street, nnd from thence to Cnr
mel street with nBphnlt on tho pros
cntatlon of n petition signed by n ma
Jorlty of tho property owners.
There Is n unanimous opinion thnt
tho' street should bo paved, paved
within tho means of tho property own
ers. Wo bollovo wo uuoto Mr. Carlylo
president of tho Carlylo Paving Brick
Company of Portsmouth, O., that ho
thought "It should not cost over $3.2
or $3.75 per front foot to pavo East
Second street with brick." Again it
has been said by.thoso who profess to
know that Huntington, W. Va., Is
putting down brick at $1.90 per lineal
foot. Gentlemen, If you know this to
be true or nnythlng else relating to
tho business of paving streets, now Is
tho time to mako It known.
In this connection wo print a letter
from tho engineer of the city of Lex
Ington In reference to asphalt. We
call attention to this part of tho letter:
"We lime not had much trouble,
vtltlt cither brick or" usphalt; one of
our hratlcst tnuelcd asphalt streets
is showing wear and has been re
paired by the contractor. This street
Is Ave years old nnd cnrrlcs approxi
mately 7,."i(l0 i chicles of all kinds per
day."
When does Maysville, or what street
in Mnysvlllo averages 7,500 vehicles
nor day? Again:
"We hint' ncu-r had any trouble
whatever on streets with more mod
erate truffle, snv hp to 3.000 vehicles
per day; we luue only two blocks of
brick In the heavy trafllc district,
which nrc about nine years old, and
nre showing considerable wear."
How docs two blocks compare with
all brick In tho business section of
Maysville? Again:
"An asphalt street Is easily aiid
cheaply maintained, continuously to
iret best results."
Tho objections being urged aro the
need of repair, cost of keeping clean,
a granite block, and n double row of
brick along the street car track and
tho cement gutter. Why a granite
block? We think some other block
would do Just as well, but this Is an
other story.
Hero is the full text, of tho com
munication from Loxlngton. Read It
nnd study It until you understand It.
By tho way, Lexington has twenty
miles of asphalt. It must not bo so
bad or olso Lexington would not put
down so much of It.
Asphalt streets hero aro subdivided
into thred classes, A. B. and C. ClaBS
A being two Inch sheet asphalt sur
faco, ono Inch binder and six Inches
concrete.
Class B, V,i Inches asphalt surface.
ono inch binder and six Inches con
crete.
Class C, 2 inches asphalt concrete
over six Inches concrete. No binder.
Cost of Contract.
A $1.30 per squaro yard surface;
$4.50 to $5.10 per cubic yard; prices
lucludo grading.
B $1.20 per square yard asphalt
surface, $4.50 to $5.10 per cubic yard;
prices Includo' cost of grading.
C $1 per squaro yard asphalt sur
faco, $4.60 per cubic yard concrcto;
prices include grading.
Brick Hi inch sand cushlou, six
Inches concrete base, cost by contract
from $1.38 to $1.80 per squaro yard
for brlek surface: $4.5ti to $5.50 per
cubic yard concreto baso; prices In
clude grading.
Wo havo not had much troublo,
with elthor brick or asphalt, ono of
our heaviest traveled asphalt streets
Is showing wear and has been repaired
by contractor; this street Is live years
old nud carries 7,500 vehlcloB per day
of all kinds.
Wo havo never had any troublo
whalover on streets with moro mod-
orato tralllc, say up to 3,000 vehicles
per day. Wo havo only two blocks of
brick In heavy trafllc district, which
aro about nine years old, and aro
showing considerable wear; other
brick streets showing good results on
moro modornto tralllc BtroetB.
Warm weathor will not materially
affect asphalt surfaco If mixed prop
erly. What markings aro mado shift
and disappear. Tho right kind of
markings In an asphalt street usually
shqws good qualities and no bad re
sults. An asphalt street Is easily and
cheaply maintained, and should bo re
paired and maintained, continuously
to get best rcsultB. It la dlfllcult to
give coBt data for maintenance duo
to ago of streets, amount of traffic,
amount of cleaning It receives, etc
