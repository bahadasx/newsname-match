H
AS the magnitude of our indepen
dence occurred to you lately? Has
the fact that Tuesday is an anni
versary than which there is none
other comparable? . H4 it been in your
mind to read again the farewell address of
Washington to Congres to guide you in
your deliberation on paparedness? West
ward the Star of Empire) has made its way.
Do you realize that the kolonies have ex
panded to the Greatest Empire of Freedom
and Force on Earth, anci your right to the
declaration that you arej an American citi
zen is the one of which you should be
proudest? Is our mind dear on the ques
tion of whether you should prepare for
defense to the point 6 aggressiveness or
equip sufficiently for resistance only ?
Would you change the attitude of the
present and future generations from that
of Washington, Adams 'and Patrick Henry?
Would you put yourself in the way of
preparation to meet any and all who would
disregard our rights anywhere and every
where on earth ? Think of some of these
questions for a moment, if no longer, Tues
day, February 22nd, the anniversary of the
birth of the greatest American.
All parties interested in the
road leading west from the Mus
Bel Fork bridge to the Atterbury
farm are requested to meet at
the Court House Monday, Feb.

Brunswick Enterprise
The merchants and other
citizens of Brunswick have made
another step forward and in the
direction of something which
will pay, this time.
Last week the whole town, so
to speak, met and voted unani
mously to bave a ferry, estab-
jshed connecting Brunswick with
Saline county, and the owner of
a ferry boat and barge being on
band, no time was lost in con
tracting with him to open up
the way for commerce between
the city and a rich territory
which was. except for the Mis
souri river, contiguous to Bruns
wick.
Capt Charles H. Smith of Kan
sas City, the owner of a number
one boat and barge, was con
tracted with to make trips across
the Missouri river, beginning in
April, and twice each week the
crossing would be free to all
foot passengers, Brunswickers
paying Capt Smith for this free
. A 4 ar A t
service tne sum oi $iou eacn
month he operates the boat, for
a specified time. The balance of
the time and for other traffic,
the captain will collect and be
entitled to, the proceeds of what
ever business he may Becure.
There is no question but what
this will prove a popular route
to Kansas City from St Louis
by automobile, the trail being
good between Moberly and
Brunswick and much shorter
than via Glasgow, and the
crossing of the river much safer
and more " convenient and no
more expensive, and the long
stretch of sand south of Glasgow
avoided.
Nearly every kind of advertis
ing pays if you have the goods
when those attracted snow up,
and if Brunswick does not meet
all requirmenta, or at least what
can be reasonably expected of
her, we miss our guess, and
the advancement of the ""sugges
tion or prediction is not made
for individual selfish purposes
nor to spread any of the afore
said for private gain.
Misses Frances Dempsey and
Geraldine Hooper, of Triplett,
were the guests of Miss Chris
Hershey Saturday and Sunday.
Mrs. Geo. Stotts and little
daughter, Jack, of Cody, Neb.;
who have been visiting relatives
ia Brunswick and Carrollton,
visited friends here the first of
the week.
ROAD MEETING
Screen Struck Girls
Through an arrangement just
consumated, Miss Beajriz Miche
lena, the operatic star who has
achieved fame in the motion
picture world as the heroine of
such feauture photo plays as
"Salomy Jane," "Mignon,"
"Salvation NelL" etc. will be
come a regular contributor to
the Courier.
Miss Michelena's articles wil
appear under the title, "Talks
With Screen-Struck Girls," and
will endeavor to give an uncolored
insight into the conditions and
difficulties surrounding the aver
age girl's first endeavor to break
into the motion picture profession
The hints and advice which she
will give are founded on actua
experience. They will tell the
screen-struck girl some of the
things she should do, and, quite
as many, perhaps, which she
should not do. They will also
try to correct for her many of
the delusions about the motion
picture case with which motion
picture acting may be mastered
and the fabulous salaries which
are, said to be at cnce in waiting.
Unlike many other articles
like nature, Miss Micnelena wi
keep as far as possible away
from generalities. She proposes
to make each talk short and
poignant and confined to the one
definite purpose of giving advice
and information to the girl with
motion picture aspirations.
The first "Talk With Screen
Struck Girls" will appear
this issue.
Ground Hog Day
The attempt on the part of
a lot of alleged progressives to
change the date for the appear
ance oi the ground hog will
prove abortive and fail to affect
in the least the habits of these
weather prophets and old timers
who have been intimately ac
quainted with their mode of
living, their delicacy when ser
ved with sweet potatoes hot and
their business habits ever since
Hec was a pup.
February 14 is ground hog
day, that is, his day for coming
out and taking a look at weather
conditions, preparatory to going
to bed again and having a nap
or, if the sign is right, shaking
himself, returning to his domestic
quarters, rousing his family and
getting all in order for camping
outside until the next winter.
Monday was both kinds of a
day started in threatening bad
weather and cleared off and re
mained fine throughout the re
mainder of the day and night.
f Mr. G. Hog turned out early,
we will have good weather from
this on until Nov. 1, but if he
slept late as did a number of
other business people, the deter
mination of the date for his
pearance for settling the state of
the weather for six weeks is
badly disarranged, for the day
was similar in all respects to the
second of the month, after 10 a.
m. and no conclusive evidence
can be offered at this time as to
the fallacy of the contention of
the newfanglers. Then the whole
solution of the question at this
time, if it is to be solved now,
rests on the habit of the hog in
respect to sleeping late on the
day he is booked to prophecy.
We will interview some of the
old time darkies on this point
and hold their testimony in readi
ness for next year and confront
unbelievers with it and other
unanswerable testimony.
CIRCUIT COURT CONT'D
Docket Cleared, Few Transfers.
Only One for Pen.
Jail Full.
Mr. and Mrs. O. L Hatler
Rothville were the guests of Mr.
and Mrs. W. G. Wright Saturday
and Sunday.
Miss Avis Wright entertained
the seventh grade pupils at her
home ons evening last week with
a party. Miss Avis is popular
with not only her class and
teachers, but with all the young
and old folks in town. The
evening was highly enjoyed and
all departed with high opinions
of the young lady's entertaining
qualities. ,
Juvenile Party
Little Louise Wilson enter
tained how many of her little
riends with a party on her
birthday it is hard to say. They
were not still long enough, even
at the dainties set before them,
for anyone to make a correct
count. Louise was four years
old Saturday and was a delight
ful hostess and all those favored
with an invitation enjoyed the
fine things Louise gave them to
eat and the plays to the utmost
Billy tried to act like they were
kids" too small tor his atten
tion, but he was in the game all
thru just the same.

Surprise Birthday Party

pretty and useful presents, be
sides each lady brought with her
a big basket filled with every
thing good. Fried chicken,
roast chicken, ham, jellies, salads,
p:es, cakes, cookies, etc.
The big diningroom table fairly
grodiied under the weight of to
many good things to eat Mrs.

happy da long to be remembered
