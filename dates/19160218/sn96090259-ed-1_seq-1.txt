Washington, D. C., Feb. 18.—The

cannot be closed until the United
States has fully considered ttTe possi
ble effect of the declared intention of
the Qermanio powers to sink all armed
merohantships of the enemies without
warning after February 29.
The Lusitania agreement oannot be

RARE CASES
Two Rare Medical Cases at the Clinic
Drs. Geyerman & Wheeler
By strange coinoidenoe two very rare
and yet similar oases appeared last
week at the well known olinio of Drs.
Geyerman and Wheeler in this oity#
Both patients are suffering with ser
ious complications arising from the
presence of foreigo bodies in the lung.
The first patient was Gus Park
er, of Upton, Wyoming, a young man
about twenty- nine years old. He was
brought in on a stretcher because of
his desperate condition. He gave thi«
account of his own case: Iu 1906 when
nineteen-years CM he had su attack of
pneumonia from which he recovered
slowly that his father took him in a
dovered wagon to New Nexico, thinking
he might be benefitted (hereby. How*
ever after a year he developed
empyeme of the lung. Two ribs were
removed and a rubber tube put in for
drainage. After wearing this tube for
some time it became lost and the wound
healed. The patient gradually lost in
strength. He went to physicians far
and wide who pronounoed him suffer
ing with tuberoulosis. His father
again made the attempt to benefit his
health by a ohange in climate, and in
the winter of 1912 took him to the
mountains of Eouador, South America.
There was a rapid deoline in his oon
dition and for the last three years he
was given up as a hopeless consump
tive.
Last week he was taken to the olinio
in this oity and although he was hardly
able to sit up long enough to undergo
an examination the powerful X-Ray
was turned jpon his lungs. The dis
oovery was then made (hit a rubber
drainage tube existed in bis lung which
of course was the one whioh had been
ost ten years previously.
The seoond case was that of Glen
Pierce of this oity, aged twenty-two,
who ten years previously while holding
a brass upholstery tack between his
teeth had been seized with, a fit of
coughing. The taok dissappeared down
his throat. A few days later he was
taken down with an attack of pneu
monia from whioh he has never re
covered.
He
haB
of
BO
been treated by many phy-
sloians for consumption and says he
has taken a b&rrell of medicine, The
X-Ray however showed the presenoe of
the tack in bis luu£, whereas everyoue
had claimed it must have been swal
lowed and passed along the intestinal
tract, and had been forgotten for years
The first case, Gus Parker, was oper
ated upon today under local anaesthesia
in connection with nitrous oxide gas
and the tube was recovered. The
patient experienced immediate relief
and is getting on nioely.
The 6eoond case is being prepared
for operation and the final outcome of
both is being Watched with a great deal
of interest both by physicians and the
laity.

ANOTHER ENDORSEMENT
Sjoux Falls Man Says to See Black Hills
Fine Scenery
Reoently there appeared in the Sioux
Fills Journal a write-up of the new
spirit which has been awakened in the
Black Hills written by George Sohloss
er and this week another Sioux Falls
man comes out with the following en
dorsement iu the same paper:
"I waut to add my endorsement to
what George Sohlosser said last week
about seeing your own oountry first,
and naturally the Black Hills," said E
D, Moroom. "We are always looking
for something we oannot find, yet for
scenery and olimate and hospitality
the Black Hills presents all the quali
fications any scenic locality oan boast
of. A visit to the Hills in the summer
is inexpensive, the scenery is not ex
celled anywhere on the continent, and
la the Spearflsh oanyon one needs
blankets every night, no matter what
the day might be, but it never gets hot
in there. There are hundreds of miles
of mountain streams swarming with
trout, the woods are filled with flowers
and there is wild fruit in abundance.
For rugged soenery there is nothing
more inspiring than these great mount*
ains, olothed in mantles of green up to
the timber line, and while there is no
Matterhorn, yet there are peaks still
unsealed. The Hills people have been
spending thousands in {the construct
ion of mountain roads, so it is possible
to oover most of the soenio routes with
autos, but where this isn't possible
there is the sure-footed quadruped and
if not in a hurry pedestrianism oan
have full opportunity for its ability,
with rest houses conveniently located
so one need never fear of having to lay
out under the blue oanopy during the
night or go long stretches without a
substantial meal, And why spend large
sums in railroad travel to see some
thing not nearly as pleasing and in
spiring as we have right in our own
door yard."

WfllUflODGAME
LOCAL BASKET BALL TEAM
DISPLAYED GREAT SKILL
THE SCORE WAS 2923
ADDED ANOTHER VICTORY TO THEIR
LONG LIST LAST FRIDAY
EVENING
Before an appreoiative audienoe of
royal fans, our olassy high sohool
basket ball team, took the measure of
the fast aggregation
a
Belle Fourohe started the game by
sooring three field baskets, in the first
two minutes of play but their fast
plays were soon broken by the locale.
A.Eastman for the looals made the first
point, by a perfeot throw for foul bas
ket. Soore G-l for the visitors. With
several olever passes, Susie, Magowan
and Art scored three perfeot
field baskets, followed quickly by Belle
Fourohe with a foul basket. The game
was getting close now and each team
was fighting their hardeBt. Belle
Fourohe got away for three more good
clean field baskets, whioh gave them a
good lead over the looals however
again our looal boys came back with
some of their brilliant team work and
Magowan and Eastman added two
more field basketB and Belle Fourohe
followed in the last minute of play, of
Uis flratihalf, wHb «nother field basket.
First half ended score 11-15 favor of
the visitors.
It was now apparent to the fans, that
the last half would be a bitter oontest,
for with only four points between
them, it was nobodys game yet
Referee KeiBter blew the whistle for
the beginning of the seoond half—the
teams lost no time in finding their re
spective positions on the floor and the
play started, snappy and full of vim.
Again, with their whirlwind plays,
Belle Fourohe made two field baskets
in less than a minute of play, followed
by a suocessful free tnrow. Soore 20-11.
Now began the team work of the looals.
Belle Fourohe found themselves chas
ing the looal players baok and forth on
the field, with no apparent hope of se
curing the ball again but a foal on the
looals, gave Belle Foarohe another free
throw, followed quiokly by a free throw
for Hot Springs, boore now 12-21. Like
greased lightning the looals began their
smashing team work, with the telling
results, that A. Eastman seoured tbne
sensational long field shots, followed
by D. Eastman with a field basket and
A. Eastman with another free throw,
whioh tied the soore 21-21.
For the next few minutes neither
team Boored a point, but displayed
some olever head and team work, in try
ing to prevent eaoh other from sooring
but the looals succeeded in securing
the ball once again and Hot Spriigs
scored with a long field shot. The
visitors, not to be taken in yet, turned
about and their speedy right forward,
Steinhauer. tied the score with a per
feot field basket, soore again being tied
23-23. With the soore again tied, the
enthusiastio crowd went wild with joy,
for only a few minutes of play were
left and it was nobodys game. Referee
Keister, had to stop the playing for a
minute to silenoe the awful din, as his
decisions could not be heard by the
players.
The game proceeded, both teams de
termined to win at all hazards, when
A. Eastman, under most trying oon
ditions took a ohanoe shot from the
middle of the floor and scored a per
feot field basket, plaoing the local*
two points in the lead. After a series of
passes, in olose formation, Hot Springs
shot another field basket and in the
last minute of play, duplicated the per
formance whioh gave the team a soore
of 29. ThuB ended the fastest game
ever exhibited on the looal floor, amid
the cheering of of the large crowd of
fans.
This game, was the game of all games
to be won, for Belle Fourohe bad not
lost a game thie season, and would
have been the champions of the Black
Hills oould they have hung the ecalps
of the looal boys on their belt but
kind Providence had decreed other
wise.

from Belle

sensational plays, olever team work,

mnoh oredit is due them in their hard
fight. Sherman and Steinhauer scored
for the visitors and Baboook as left
guard, starred in preventing the locals
from runuing up a larger soore.
Bruce and Gibson, as guards, for the
looals, assisted their team mates ma
terially in their game, and like the re
mainder of the team, play basket ball
at all times.
The line up of the two teams were aa

The Hot Springs team will leave on
Thursday, the 17th, for a trip in the
upper Hills, at whioh time they will
play Rapid OHy aud Belle Foarohe
thus finishing their high Sohool baeket
ball schedule for the Hills, and un
doubtedly plaoe themselves in line to
attend the state tournament to be held
at Huron, during the month of March.
The looals have two more games, in
addition to their Hills trip, with New
castle, Wyoming, one at this plaoe and
one at Newoastle.
Should this team be so fortunate as
to attend the Btate tournament, we
are sure a good showing will be made*
for it is Beldom that suoh wonderful
team work oan be equalled anywhere
either in high schools or oolleges.
