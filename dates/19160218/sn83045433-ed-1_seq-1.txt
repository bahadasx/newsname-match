th? narrow window, In Sina Sina-?? death
houaa early thia morning a tiny shaft of
licht wu gleaming. Under the light a
fear-nnrabed man waa preparing to die.
On September ?. 1*11. thla stricken man
murdered Anna Aumueller. a girl who
lived tor and trusted him. He wu a priest,
Hans Schmidt. She was ona of his flock.

?as forsaken, unforgiven by man, un
frocked, unwept, friendless and alone,
this man who once hsd preached in beau
tiful phrases the word of God. He was
to die at ito this morning.
Four prison guards had been detailed
to prevent him cheating the State of the
price !t demands for murder. Thrice
within the week Schmidt had threatened
suicide. I?ast night he was raring.

This morning his keepers said he might
walk to his death calmly, or he might
ti-*ht ilk? a madman. Such was this con
demned man.
Mis conduct had changed with the day?

and rave?! through the following day. He

Schmidt's was a hideous crime. And as

it was thought possible that he would
leave a statement behind him. He had

lie knew and prayed with.
He was asked last night whether he
? ished to leave a On?! statement to the
world. He sent back word that he had
said all that he would.
There was no sleep tn the house of hor
ror tonight. The curuuns were drawn In
front of the cells wherein the other
twenty condemned are living their final
weeks of life. Now and then a sneering
farewell was bawled In th? corridor.
Now and then a hopeless man asked
Schmidt whether he was watching the
clock. And every one? In a while some
one asked the doomed murderer srhether
"they had slit his trousers yet."
Hears Hoara Tolled.
But steadily, all through this, th?
prayers of the blue-eyed prison chaplain
arose.
Now and then a train rushed through tb?
tunnel that undermines the death house.
Every hour a gong rang In the concrete
corridor that leads to the cell block. And
there, kneeling on the floor, Schmidt
heard th? hours tolled away.
There was no sympathy for this man

war bordered Germany, a very old man
and a very old woman?the mother and

"Death Warrants" Omitted.
At least nln?ty-three Americans have
been Killed In Mexico since President Wil
son entered the White House.
A statement submitted to the Senate
yesterday by Secretary Lansing In re
sponse to a resolution gives a list of
seventy-six Ameritan? who lost their
lives in the southern republi** In the
years 1913. 1914 and 1915.
This, of course, does not Include the
seventeen Americans massacred by Villa
bandits early In January, so that th?
known list now totals ninety-three.
In addition to this. Secretary Lans
ing discloses that twenty civilian Amer
icans in those three years ??nd sixteen
American soldiers were killed on Amer
ican soil as the result of border troubles.
Thus the total number of Americans who
are officially acknowledged to have per
ished Is 13.
Tl?? statement submitted by Mr. Lans
ing to the Senate yesterday Is the first
list that the Wilson administration ever
has made public of the loss of American
life In Mexico. The resolution which
called forth the disclosure was introduc
ed by Senator Fall, of New Mexico, a Re
publican.
Many Paris Withheld.
Many had expected a full snd frank
statement of the entire Mexican sit
uation from the administration, but
Mr. Lansing, acting on the President's
orders, dealt with the situation only
in a general way and replied that
much of the detailed matter called for
could not be furnished because it
would not be "compatible with the
public Interest" to give it
Among the significant omissions
from the report were the naval order?
which Senator Fall insists were Issued
to tb? United States marines who
landed at Vera Crus. Senator Fall
haa described these orders as "death

Another notable omission was the
correspondence which passed between
the Brazilian ambassador in Mexico
City while he waa representing the
United States and the State Depart

la Ireland ? pathetic toward the war. but
evidences of a seditious anti-government
campaign ru-ve been unearthed.
With a freedom which is regarded as
most unusual, the censor is allowing the
publication of certain facts pointing to
deep political unrest in Ireland. The
anti-government campaign apparently has
its headquarters in Dublin, from which
city the activities are b?"ing directed.
The police have raided a number of
houses and have suppressed at least t<*n
newspapers within the past few week.?.

Already considerable drafts from Eng

put into some of th? Irish battalions.
More than 100 English cavalrymen are
now serving in one of the most famous
of the Irish regiments uf the line. An
other great Irl?h battalion, which had
distinguished itself in past wars. Is 300

Although Ireland has a male popula

FIRM STAND OF
?. S. RESULT OF
POLITICAL PLAN
Hinted That Wilson Is Assum
ing Bold Front Against Teu
tons to Aid Candidacy.
SEEKS GREAT VICTORY
Granting of Requested Assur
ances Would Mean Diplo
matic Laurels.
Th* suggestion wa? made I?.-! night
In diplomatic circles that the present
attitude of the United State? on the
Lusitania ?-ontroversy and the whole
question of sut-marine warfare Is based
on politi???* expediency. There are three
reason? influencing the administration
In It, changed couree, according to thla
diplomatic opinion. These are:
1. If Germany can be induced to
consent to embody in her reply to the
Lusitania note the assurances for the
future conduct of submarine warfare
he demands. President Wilson may
claim a diplomatic victory.
2. If Germany insists on confining
the Lusitania controversy strictly to
the facts of that Issue alone, negotia
tions can be drawn out until after the
election next November.
3. The speech by Ellhu Root, at the
Republican State convention In New
York, attacking the administration, has
Influenced the President to put on ft
bold front against the central empires.
Meantime negotiationa looking to ft
settlement of the case have come to ?n
abrupt halt. For the first time in the
nine months that have elapsed since
the dispatch. May IS, 1915, of the first
Lusitania note officiala of the German
Kmbassy have felt justified In assum
ing a frankly dilatory attitude. One
of these officials expressed the em
bassy's point of view as follows:
"Until today Germany has supposed
that the United States was sincerely
anxious to settle th?? Lusitania case
with the least possible delay. Now,
however, it is apparent that this is not
the situation. The United States has
taken the view that an immediate set
tlement would be a favor to Germany.
Hon.- Krirrst 1? Trae.
"Quite the reverse is true. Indefinite
postponement would put Germany In
the tenth heaven of delight. Th? United
States, now that it has made Its posi
tion clear, can count on all the delay
imaginable, so far as ?Sermany la con
cerned."
Confirming this sentiment ?-ame the
announcement last night by Count von
Bernstorff that he had not only not
transmitted to his government the
new demands of the United States, but
that he could not say definitely when
he would do so. It Is probable the
i;-rman ambassador will delay cabling
Berlin the new revisions demanded by
the State Department until tomorrow,
and perhaps until Monday.

State Department Prefer? to Continue
Policy of Acting Alone in Dip
lomatic Matter?.
Secretary of State Lan-nng \esterday
declined to commit the United States gov
ernment to a reply to proposala of the
Swedish government for Joint action
against British interference with com
merce and the mail*.
The Swedish Minister, W. A F. Eken
gren, two weeks ago presented a not*?
from his government appealing to the
United States to "take appropriate ac
tion" In co-operation with Sweden and
other neutrals to end violation? of Inter
national law by Great Britain.
At that time Secretan' 1-Anstng told
Minister Kkengren that tho negotiation?
between the United States and Germany
over the Lufitania case ?ere pending and
the United State? did not ?iah to make
an immediate, reply to the Swedish pro
posais.
Yesterday Minister Ekengren railed at
the State Department to ask Secretary
l*an?ing for ft reply to the Swedish pro
posals. He was told that th*- I-usitania
negotiations still are pending and that
the United States Is not prepared to re
ply.
State Department official? say that th??
United Statea has not accepted any of
the numerous propesale made by neutral*
nations sinee the b- ginning of tl*e war to
join in protests against British restriction
of commerce and communication prefer
ring to follow Its customary course of
aeting Independently.
*>vredlah Kney Dlaappolntrd.
In diplomatic ?quarters it is known that
the Swedish Minister is disappointed by
the attitude the United States has
adopted.
The British interference with the maila,
particularly the usurpation of the right
to censor first-class mail, is regarded by

A strong indictment against British ag

says that "only a few rules serving as

and It fears that Vheae remaining few

P-adal G??? to Tt? Wsahiartoa Heratl
London. Feb. 17.?All the belligerents
are bleeding to death and assurances that
our enemies are bleeding faster than wa.
do not meet the ?ase. because no sane
person Imagines that the death of an
Englishman is a final gain to Oermftny.
or that tbe death of a German Is a final
gain to England.
If the whole population of Oermany
had been wiped out In lftt try an earth
quake, all Europe?Including these Isl
ands?would hav? been poorer and the
same Germane who send Zeppelins to
drop bombs on London would nave bean
dismayed If Ludgate Hill had become an
active volcano at the same time.
It Is a paradox of war that eelf-preaar
vatlon becomes sul.'lde and suicida be
comes self-preservation.
