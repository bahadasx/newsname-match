The History Of Influenza,
... '- Or Grip ... . , . ,
Furnished" by the Department of Pre
ventive Medicine, University of
: , ' Missouri, Columbia,, Mo.
Influenza, " commonly . called
grip, is one of the oldest diseases
known. A disease whioh Was
probably the grip was described
by Hippocrates 412 years before
ths birth of Christ. Many great
outbreaks of the grip affecting a
part of the known world have
since ooourrsd. ' Four great epi
demics ocourred In the Seven-
Jwevth Century, en in .the Eujht-
eenth Century and four pandem
ics in the Nineteenth Century.
Its presenoe in Amerioa is us
ually dated 1889 when the first
great epidemio for many years
affeoted us. Since that time few
years have passed without some
oases of the disease.
The study of these outbreaka
has taught us a great deal. Like
ail epidemics, the grip progress
es along routes of travel and no
faster ttmn human beings do.
Large oommeroial centers are
first affeoted, scattered cases
occurring before the general
outbreak takes place. Next ths
small (owns beome affeoted, and
lastly the entire country. The
disease appears on board hip
only after they have touched at
affeoted ports. Institutions which
are more or less out off from, the
oomraunity in whioh they are
boated, like hospitals for ths in
sane, convents and prisons,
often esoape more or lees.
Grip Infection Is from person to
person, and the oloser the con
tact the greater ths danger.
Forty peroent of the entire pop
ulation fall victim of the grip
during epidemics. Infants and
old people are less likely to take
it thai) those of middle age. It is
markedly a disease ef the winter
months. Fifty epidemios have
been voted , during the winter
months, thirty-five during the
spring months arid twenty-four
during the fall months.
As infeotion is from person 1
person directly, the prevention of
the grip Is clear, but it is dim
oult to carry out, according to
Dr. M. P. Ravenel of the depart
met of preventive" medicine of
ths University of Missouri -at
Columbia, All persons should
aveid contact with those showing
symptoms of the disease. Dur
log epidemics of the grip, crowd
ed, nieces, like . theaters, halls
snd assembling places of all
kinds, Bhouid be avoided. There
is no specific cure 'or the disease
and no specific which will pre
vent It.-
It is not a disease to be trifled
with. Persons who have been
infeoted with tuberculosis, but
who have resisted illness, often
seooumb to the disease after
having ths grit. Owing to this
fact, it has been a popular belief
that the grip often- immediately
nreoedes the declaration of t.:e
symptoms of tuberoulosis,
Getting A Stand of Clover.
O. B. Hutchison, Vnlverilty of Ml-
aourl, College ol Agriculture.
Our recent dry seasons have
discouraged many who had diffi
culty in getting stands of clover,
but if proper methods of seeding
are used, there should be little
difficulty on most of the farms In
this section. If it were possible
to- prediot a very dry year at sow
ing time, it would be better not
to use a nurse' crop whioh takes
up the moisture needed by the
olover, but as this cannot be pre
dicted it is better to have a thin
stand of some nurne crop whioh
will keep down the weeds, with
out taking too muoh moisture
from the slover or sh&iing it to
much. ,
A stand of olover is dependent
upon many faotora, su o h as
weather conditions soil, quality
of the seed, and weeds. If a
nurse crop is used, rye, wheat,
and oats are usually ranked for
their effbienoy as nurse oropa in
the order given, but farmers re
verse this order because they
would rather have oats and wheat
in their bins. The nurse crop of
oourse, does not directly, aid the
olover, but is used to keep down
the growth vt wild grasses and
weeds wfeioh tend to orowd out
and destroy the young plants. In
many cases where weeds do not
bother, the olover will often make
a better growth alone than where
it must compete with the grain
crop. Ou thin lands and In dry
seasons, a nurse orop is generally
a.disadvantage, but under favor
able conditions a stand oan usu
ally be secured with a nurse crop
and the use of the land for the
season is not entirely lost. ,
If a nurse crop is sowed in the
fall, the olover may be broadcas
ted on the meadow the following
February or early Maroh on a
frosty morning when the ground
is nicely "honeyoombed" with
frost. With Uie soil in this con
dition, the cbver seed lodges in
small cracks or crevices and is
covered when the ground thaws.
The usual rate of seeding the
clover at this time is about six or
eight pounds.
Some prefer to drill the olover
seed with a diek drill, crossing
the rows of wheat or rye at right
angles. Ths eeed should be run
into the main hoes of the drill so
it wiU be covered. Rn the disks
shallow and the wheat or timothy
plants will not be disturbed to
any great extent.
Another method which is pre
ferred by some is to sow the clov
er and timothy on ths wheat af
ter the ground is dry enough to
work and eover by light bar-
rowing.
Timothy and olover may also
be sowed alone in the spring, but
if ths land is foul with weeds, a
light seeding of grain, to be out
for hay when it is In the soft
dough or milk stage, will help to
keep the weeds under oontroL
