after prohibition (1908-13), ono to

Tho arrests for drunkenness in the

show an even greater decrease. In re

MUSIOALE OF WOMAN'S CLUB.
Much Pleasure Afforded Good Sized Au
dionco by Four Artists, Including
Miss Esther E. Dale.
It was with great enjoyment and sat
isfaction thnt n good sized audience in
the Baptist church Wednesday night
listened to the rendition of tho program
at tho Woman's club's annual musicalo.
The most appreciative expressions of
ongratuiatiou aro due those responsi
ble for the selection of the musicians
for tho event, Miss Esther E. Dale, so
nrano; Miss Rebecca Wilder Holmes,
violinist; Miss Katharine Frazicr,
harpist, and Mrs. Robert E. S. Olmsted,
iccompanist. Each proved herself to
oo really notaulo m her own particular
sphere an artist, in praise of whoso
vont no reservation needs to be made.
It is not a disparacemcnt of the work
if the other musicians to sav that in-
crest nnturallv centered in the appear-
nee or .miss uaio, who is well Known

vho has studied in Berlin nnd is makinir
i success as n member of tho Smith
ollege faculty. Her many friends
toted with pleasure her breadth of style
i nd interpretation ns well as the de-
lehtiul quality of her voico and her
harm of expression and clear cnuncia
on. She sang three groups of songs be
ides the French aria, II est doux, il est
on, from Herodiade, by Massenet;
' ve Maria, Haeh-Gounod, with piano,
nrp antt vioim accompaniment, and the
losing number, Unto Thy Heart, by

Miss Holmes, violinist, who is an
hstructor of music in Mt, Holyoke col
ego and conductor of the Smith col

tized that she possessed a musical tem
perament far above the ordinary. Be
sides fully meeting tho technical le
uircments of her selections she brought
nit a tonal quality and wealth of ex

In full sympathy with the soloists

tumorous responses to encores.
LTJSITANIA CASE ACCEPTABLE.
But United States Opposes Policy of
Sinking Armed Merchant Ships With
out Warning.
Secretary Lansing yesterday accepted
he Lu&itania agreement ns acceptable to
United States in so fnr as it relates to
that case, but asks Count Von Born
ttorff, the German ambassador, for as
surances that Germany will not carry its
policy of sinking merchant ships with
out warning to liners, even if they car
ry defensive armament.
The question of whnt constitutes de
fensive armament is to be determined
Inter in a way not ngreed upon. It is
suggested that tho United States may
proposo that guns mounted on the stern
if ships nnd capablo of being swung
from lo to 30 degrees in either diiec
tion might como within that class.
It was stated authoritatively that
Germany, because of its unusual posi
tion, cannot and will not accept tho
suggestion of tho United States ns it
now stands thnt liners carrying guns
shall bo immune from attacks under
previous assurances.

might have been argued were other

Tho Westminster case of D. 1'.

for the plaintiff and Gibson and Daley
for the defendants.
In the suit of George Tudor and A.
Crosby Kenuett agninst Herbert S.
Mudgett and in the suit of A. Crosby
Kcnnctt and Herbert S. Mudgett
against George A. and Ernest Tudor
motions were filed that the cases bo
sent back pro forma with a mandate
that the Tudors be allowed .to plead
their discharge in bankruptcy in de
fpnse of these actions. Those suits grow
out of a lumber deal nnd went to tho
supreme court on the question of tho
admissibility of somo evidence and on
law questions involved.
The case of Carl S. Hopkins, trustee,
appellant, against the estate of John P.
i "getii oi nest urauicuoro, waiter
Sylvester, executor, a suit over the di

for the plaintiff.
Attorney General Horbo 't G. Barber
called the attention of tli'i court Tues
day to the case of the state against
George Warner of Simo.isvillo, in tho
town of Andovcr, who. in ovembor,
1914, killed Mr. nnd 14 rs. Henry F.

cd a claim that the court' had' erred i.i
admitting certain testimony and again
that there had been nn error of law in
the charge to the jury. As tho law
makes it discretionary with the court
whether a defendant shall be prcsenc
in court when questions of law aro be
ing argued the attorney general called
the case to the attention of the court,
that they might decide ns to whether
to require Warner's presence.
It was the decision of the court that
Warner should bo present in court and
Sheriff J. H. Kiniry of Windsor county
was notified imme'diately to have fio
prisoner in court Wcd-iesdny.
The case of Gibson & Waterman, at
