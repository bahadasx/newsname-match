1ST SENT

As the Ohio Authorities Accepted
His Version ofthe Death
of Samuel Kline.
Mrs. Henrlotta J. West, of Big
(Isaac, was here Friday on her return
from Canton, 0., where her son,
j Clarence aged 22 years, was given an !
Indeterminate sentence to the rnformntnrv
at Mansfleld. O.
\ Young West was indicted for scc1
ond degree murder in connection
with the death of Samuel Kline, a:
! Jitney bus driver, at Barberton, near
1 Canton. October 7, last. West had
1 been working In a factory at Canton,
but was on the way homo at the
I time of Kline's death. He had missed
| n train at Harmon and Had hired
Kline to convey htm through. Young
! West had a ride which he Intended
to bring home with him. lie had
been out hunting shortly before he
concluded to return to West Virginia
and he thought it best to extract the
contents of the gun before bringing
It back. As he was doing thin, he
says, one bullet entered Kline's back
and he fell on his face. West Immediately
rushed to the nearest
neighbor's house to toll what had
happened and the woman of the
house stated that he was crying at
the time. However, before telling
what happened, he changed ills mind,
coming to the hasty conclusion that
ho could escape In the automobile
and not be connected so far as the
public knew with the death or
Kline.
When the news of Kline's death
and West's escape in the automobile
became known, feeling ran high and
all kinds of stories were told. One
siory was that highway robbery had
been done in connection with the accident
and thatWest had taken tlOO
In mnnev from Kline. That nroved
untrue as he had only $1 and a
watch on him when found. Another
published story was that he had shot
Kline twice. That proved untrue.
When the case came up for trial
1 Tuesday of this week. West's attorj
neys. Will E. Morris, of this city, and
I A. F. McCue, of West Union, found
1 that there had been quite a change
; of sentiment In Canton and the state
authorities vory readily accepted
West's version of the shooting. How
ever, a charge of theft of the automobile
hung over West also, and after
consultation It was agreed upon
that a sentenco to the t-eform school
should be given him. Had he stood
trial and been convicted of second
degree murder, as charged In the Indictment,
he would have had to serve
a life term, as that Is the penalty.
The sentence to the reform school
closed the charges against him. Including
that of the theft of the au

THE CONVERTS ARE MANY,
Hearers Are Impressed with
Preaching of New Pastor
Who Flays Sin and Evil.
Last evening In the First Methodist
church, Dr. King, the new pastor,
delivered a sermon which was
pronounced the equal of anything _
which was heard during the great nor- .
ies of revival talks given by Dr. Mor- i
rison. J
The membership is greatly pleased
with Dr. King's work here and fools
that before he closes the meeting
there will be one of the greatest outpotirlug
of religious blessing that has
contoupon the church in many years.
The main auditorium was filled last
night and the interest grew to the extent
that practically every person .
present took some pari in me serv-;ic
ices.
The principal theme of Dr. King's!
sermon was the consequences following
a sinful life and the fact that one
cannot hope for future happiness un-j
less there Is a remission and a turn- w
Ing away from our waywardness.-The w
pastor cited numerous Instances ai
where the fact that."sin lleth at the In
door" brought about ruin and the ut- hi
ter downfall. He exhorted his hear- w
ers In ablest terms to turn from ei
things evilxand follow after those
which are pure. b;
The meeting was proof positive b:
that with the deparlure of Dn. Mor- j hi
rlson the revival spirit did not abate.!
It is present in all the vital force I
which marked the past, and continues
to become moro and more pronounced.

There will be a great meeting for pi
men on Sunday afternoon, with the vregular
services announced as far as m
Tuesday night. fr
