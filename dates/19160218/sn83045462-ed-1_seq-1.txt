QUICK VOTE IS DUE I

Early Action by Senate Ex- ,

Ambassador to Mexico.
SENATOR FALL CONDEMNS
'CUTTLEFISH DIPLOMACY'
Disappointed in President's Report <
of Conditions Preceding Carranza
Regime.
Renewed discussion of the
Mexican situation in the Senate 1
and a quick vote on the noniina- ,
tion of Henry Prather Fletcher 1
as ambassador to Mexico were t
forecast today as a result of i
President Wilson's response to a '
Senate resolution calling for, the
facts leading up to the recognition
by the United States of the
de facto government in Mexico,
headed by Venustiano Carranza.
The President's reply was submitted
in a letter from Secretary
Lansing summarizing conditions
which preceded recognition of
Uarranza. It gave a list of sev- t
cnty-six Americans who lost 8
their lives in Mexico in the years (
1913. 1914 and 1915. In addition l
it showed that twenty civilian 1
Americans in those three years
and sixteen soldiers were killed <
on American soil as the result of i
Mexican troubles.
Secretary Lansing, in his letter, said ;
that in the territory controlled by the
Carranza government, it was affording ,
"reasonably adequate protection to the i
lives and property of Americans." J
Senator Fall Disappointed. \
Senator Fall, author of the resolution, !
today expressed disappointment that
the President did not include official
reports on political conditions and i
events in Mexico called for in his resolution.
The President held it to be incompatible
with public interests to
divulge correspondence of a highly
confidential nature, f 1
Senator Fall said that he thought he i:
would be a Me to supply the Senate e
'with some of the missing links" in
the circumstances which led up to 1
'he recognition of the Carranza gov- i
emment
"T will study the report before I
undertake to do anything," said Sen- 1
i*tor Fail. "But I know enough of the 1
report already to declare that my pur- J
pose in calling upon the administration j
for information regarding the reasons J
for recognition of the Carranza gov- |
emment was justified. The report :
tiialfM it arinarAnt that tJioro utqq nn f*
earthly reason for such recognition.
"The fact that political correspondence J
was withheld from the American p?o t
pie demonstrates that there was some ,
mystery about that recognition which
iell like a bombshell Mexico and the
L'nited States. |
Scores "Cuttlefish Diplomacy."
*1 cannot understand why the American
public is still kept in the dark. I
object seriously to this cuttlefish diplomacy
of the administration, this
throwing out a lot of ink to conceal Its
movements."
The Senate foreign* relations committee
is expected to meet Wednesday
to take up Mr. Fletcher's nomination.
Action oii/-the nomination had been de^
laved by republicans pending the receipt
of the President's response contending
that it would show there was
no responsible government in Mexico.
The President, through Mr. Lansing,
declined to comply with that part of
the Fall resolution asking for diplomatic
and consular reports on political
conditions and events in Mexico. The
Senate was informed that it was not
compatible with nubile lnto.?c<. I
furnish this correspondence.
Reasons for Recognition.
The Une of reasoning which led the 1
pan-American conferees to decide upu^ f
the recognition of Gen. t'arranza's gov- \
ernment as the de facto government in 1
Mexico last fall is given in the letter *
of Secretary Lansing, as follows: \
"The attempt to bring the factions <
together for a conference failed. Sub- *
alantially all the commanders and j
others in authority who were associ- \
ated with Gen. Villa replied directly
and independently in varied language, .
accepting the suggestion for a conference.
On the other hand, all the commanders
and others in authority who
were affiliated with (Jen. t'arranza re.
plied briefly to the effect that the appeal
had been referred to Gen. t.'arranza,
whose superior authority they
acknowledged and who would make
such reply as he deemed proper. The
inference to be drawn was plain. On
the one hand there seemed to he no
central organization among the Villista
forces, while on the other hand submission
to a central authority was evi
denced in the repftes of the Carranzistas.
"The unity and loyalty of the Carranzistas
appeared to indicate the ultimate
triumph of that faction, especially
as the Carranzista fnrr?? w?

control of approximately 76 per cent of
ibe territory of Mexi*o. Accordingly
the conferees, after careful and Impartial
consideration of all the circumstances.
decided unanimously to recommend
severally to their respective governments
that in their opinion the gov trnmeni
of which Gen. Oarranza was
the leader should be recognized as the
de facto government of Mexico."
Ability to Protect Americans.
Regarding the ability of the t'arranza
government to give protection to
Americans and other foreigners In Mexico.
Mr. Lansing's letter said:
"As to the ability of the de facto
government to fulfill its promises to
protect lives and properties along the
border the undersigned has the honor
to call your attention to the fact that
since assurances in this respect were
given to this government by the de
facto government the disturbances

CABINET CONSIDERS
FLOOD MINNS
Active Assistance in Control,

Planned.
PRESIDENT WILL URGE
CONGRESS TO GIVE AID
Secretaries Lane, Redfield and
Houston Will Decide on What
Steps Are Necessary.
I
Active assistance in controlling # and
preventing floods on the Mississippi and
pther rivers is being planned by the
federal government. The question was
:aken up fully at today's cabinet meetng
and after Secretary Redfleld had
ead a telegram appealing for assistance
'rom Walter Parker, secretary of the
S>w Orleans civic organization.
The cabinet decided that Secretary
Redfleld should send a telegram to Parker
promising action and that Secretaries
Lane, Redfleld and Houston, who
iave been studying the question for
several months, should meet in the near
uture and decide on steps which should
t>e taken by the federal government.
As a result of the projected conference
of the three cabinet members.
:he President is expected to send
ecommendations to Congress for legisation
for flood control.
Committee Now Investigating.
These recommendations will be taken
lp by the special House committee on
food control, which is now on an inipection
tour In the Mississippi valley
nvestigating flood conditions. This
jommittee, headed by Representative
lumphries, is expected back in Washngton
next week.
Loss of life and property from floods
in the Mississippi and other valleys in
the last few years was laid before the
cabinet In detail and it was agreed
that the government should take stens
is quickly as possible to control the
Bltuatlon. The co-operation of states
lirectly concerned in the question probably
will be sought.
Exactly what legislation will be recommended
to Congress by the Presilent
was not decided on at today's cabnet
meeting. Subordinate bureaus in
:he Departments of Agriculture, Comnerce
and Interior are now engaged in
naking a very thorough investigation
of the question. Among plans considered
is the reforestation of the watersheds
of rivers.

Tells Senate Abandonment of

URGES RIGHT TO TRAVEL
I ON ARMED MERCHANTMEN
Says Change of Policy Would Make

Senator Lodge, ranking minority
member of the foreign relations
committee, made a speech
in the Senate today declaring that
abandonment by the United
States at this time of the principle
that its ports .were open to
and its citizens free to travel
upon, merchantmen of belligerent
nations armed solely for defensive
purposes would be an unneutral

said it woufd make the United

whose merchant marine had been
swept from the seas.
Ths senator spoke at length, dwell,
ing upon the history of International
law relating to the arming of merchantmen
for defense and citing precedents
In the record of the United
States.
Denied by Secretary Lansing.
He referred to reports that the administration
was preparing to change
its policy, which have been denied by
Secretary Lansing since the issuance
of the German and Austrian memorandums
announcing their Intention to
treat armed merchant ships as war Teasels
after February ?9. As late as the
President's note of May 13, 1916, signed
by Mr. Bryan, Senator Lodge said,
this government recognized that
"American citizens were within theit
undisputed rights in taking their ships
and in traveling -wherever their legitimate
business calls them upon the high
seas."
"Such." he added, "has been the practice
of all nations in regard to the
armed merchantmen." It seems utterly
tncreditable that this position should
be in any way altered now or that our
government should be ready to sur

American? to travel or ship rood? on a
belligerent merchantman subject to all
the rules which have been established
by the courts and by all international
authorities for at least two centuries.
Not Ground for Abandonment.
"The abandonment of those rights by
any neutral government on the ground
that the invention of submarines with
the necessary limitations upon the
I powers of capture possessed by those
boats Is inconceivable. Such abandon!
ment could only rest on the ground
that the rights of neutrals, the rule?
which for centuries have been agreed
upon by all nations for the protection
t of innocent lives upon vessels captured
in war, must be thrown aside and discarded,
in order that a new instrument
I of maritime destruction must not be
| impeded in its work of death and murder.
Such a doctrine is revolting to
j every Instinct of humanity, to every
principle of law and justice.
"There is, however, another side to
i this matter which is of even graver
; importance. There can be no question
that any act by a neutral which alters
j conditions created by the war is an unneutral
act and places the neutral upon
I the side of one belligerent or the other.
. Calls Lansing Note Unanswerable.
"This is eminently true of any form
| of embargo, and there is no need that
I should repeat the unanswerable arI
srument on this point embodied by Mr.
Lansing: In his note of last August to
the government of Austria-Hungary.
The war, and the war alone, has also
created conditions under which any
change at this time in the attitude
which we took officially at the outset
of the war in regard to armed merchantmen
would be an unneutral act.
The merchantmen of one belligerent
have been swept from the seas. Therefore,
if we should abandon all the
principles on this subject that we have
ever sustained, if we should abandon
the rules laid down by Mr. Lansing in
his circular of September, 1914, and declare
that our ports were closed to
armed merchantmen, or that goods and
passengers from the United States
could not be placed on an uncommissioned
^merchantmen, armed solely for
bcl i uciciibc, uui a<;iiun wuuia fincki
only on# belligerent; it would alter
conditions created by th e war and
would, therefore, be unneutral. It
would make ub at once the ally of the
belligerent whose merchant marine haa
been driven from the ocean.
"I cannot believe that the administration
thinks for a moment of altering
the well defined position which it
took at the outset of the European war,
and I believe that it must stand as
firmly on this question as it has on the
question of the embargo. Should it act
otherwise it would accept a humiliation
and incur a danger of war from
which even the boldest and the most
unscrupulous would shrink."
Senator Sterling Denies
Germany Has Right to Sink
Armed Merchant Vessels
"The principle of the right of merchantmen
to arm for defensive purposes
is too old. too well established,
and has proven too wholesome in the
interests of commerce for this government
now. in the interests of a new and
terrible engine of war, but which hai

of the principle," Senator Sterling ol

in an address condemning the proposed

of any right of Germany tc

Senate.
In liis address Senator Sterling said
that the developments of the last few
days indicated that it was not the purpose

the right of Germany to sink!

as they would war vessels. He criticfsed

der in connection wltn the killing of
1 her husband, Robert A. Milstead, at
their home, 1211 C street southeast,
July 15 last, announced its inability to

been reported to the court at the convening
hour this morning, but Chief
Justice Covington sent the Jurors back

ment, and the chief Justice discharged
the Jurors and remanded Mrs. Milstead
to Jail.
Attorneys M. E. O'Brien and J. H.
Zabel for the prisoner gave notice of
an application to admit the prisoner to

early date, and it "is considered likely
that the woman will be released on

Democratic members of the ways and

DOUBT AS TO REPORT
ON SIMMON
Fate of Excite Board Member Will
Be Decided at Meeting
Next Week.
Senator Phelan of California, chairman
of the subcommittee of the District
committee In charge of the nomination
of Gen. "Robert G. Smith as a
Tiember of the excise board of the District,
said today that after the hearings
on the Smith nomination had been
printed he would call his committee
together to take action on the nomination.
He said that he hoped the subcommittee
would be able to report to
the full District committee at its meeting
next Friday. It is expected that
the hearings before the subcommittee
will be printed by the first of next
week.
With the testimony all in, the nomination
of Gen. Smith occupies a very
precarious situation.
It was admitted today that Gen.
Smith in his defense before the committee
yesterday had made a good impression.
but it is not believed that it
is sufficient to overcome the report of
the Senate committee which investigated
excise conditions here last
spring. Senators Jones and Works of
the subcommittee (republicans) have
already stated that they are opposed to
the confirmation of Gen. Smith. The
sther members of the subcommittee are
Senators Phelan, Martin and Saulsbury,
all democrats. The appointment will
not be made a party issue, however,
it is believed, for there are a number
of democrats, including Senator Sheppard
of Texas, who are bitterly opposed
to the confirmation of Oen. Smith.

Austria, too, will be notified of
the assurances which the United
States is asking for the future, so
that the position of this government
may be fully and uniformly
known to the Germanic allies.
Dispatch on Way to Berlin.
A long dispatch from Ambassador
Bernstorff was .on its way
to Berlin today explaining that
in its negotiations with Germany
over submarine warfare the
United States will accept nothing
short of a complete agreement
covering all points for which it
has contended as to assurance
that the warfare in the future will
be conducted in accordance with
the established principles of international
law.
It la understood that the ambassador
informed his government that the
United States considers Germany's declaration
of Its Intention to sink armed
merchant ships without warning after
February 29 inconsistent with the assurances
given in the Arabic case. It
was said that he told the Berlin foreign
office that Secretary Lansing has
Informed him that the United States
desires the German declaration regard
ing ?rmoa mercnn.ni snips m uo muaifled
and that the tentative communication
designed to end the Lusitania
case will not be formally accepted by
this country until assurances regarding
the future conduct of German submarine
warfare ie given.
Berlin Seeks Assurances.
In Teutonic diplomatic circles it was
stated that the Berlin foreign office
would not modify the declaration of intention
to sink armed ships or inform
this country* that previous assurances
were binding unless Great Britain
should give assurances that a submarine
which warns a British ship
carrying defense armament would not
be fired upon.
Secretary T^ansing said the United
States considered the announcement of
The new German-Austrian naval policy
inconsistent with assurances previously
given and that the United States considered
a merchant ship with defensive armament
and one without guns at all in the
same class. Assurances were wanted, he

mil merchant ships.
Officials today declined to say exactly
'what the State Department would regard
as defensive armament. This
question will enter into future negotiations
regarding the conduct of submarine
warfare. The assertion is madin
Teutonic quarters that under prevail
ing conditions a merchant ship could
not use any armament for defensive
purposes that could not also be used
for offensive purposes. '
It was suggested at the State Department
that if a merchant ship, it:
response to a warning shot from a submarine,
flees, is bombarded during
flight, later comes to a stop and the
bombardment is not immediately stopped
she is Justified in defending herself.

London Timet Speaks of "Grave Difficulties
Besetting Him."
LONDON, February 18.?The Times
in an editorial today concerning Germany's
recent memorandum as to the
status of armed merchantmen after
February 29, says:
"England learns with gratification,
but with no surprise, that America declines
to recognize Germany's monstrous
pretention to the right to sink
armed merchantmen at sight. * It was
inconceivable that under any President
America should acquiesce in such a
policy."
The article then proceeds: to a general
defense of President Wilson, and
declares that the British people fully
understand and make allowance for the
grave difficulties Resetting him asd his
administration.
The Times incidentally deprecav?s
such attacks on President Wilson as
that made by Puneh this week. r
