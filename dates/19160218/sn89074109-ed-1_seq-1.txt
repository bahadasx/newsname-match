Legions of Snow
Balmy Weather Results in a
Speedy Disappearance of
the "Beautiful."
All this week a balmy Chi
nook. aided by a smiling sun
has been assailing the legions
of winter's snows. As a result
of the rapid thaw, many low
places are sheets of water, anc
country roads formerly in
passable because of the deep
drafts, are now almost itrtpass
able because of the wiater
slush and mud. A few more
days of continued wai
weather will witness the dis
appearance of the "beautiful"
In the city, the thawing of
iihe packed and frozen snc
wihich impeded the pedestrian
in his peregrinations about the
city has given many property
owners the opportunity to
clear their premises and walks
of the accumulation, which in
many instances wtas as much
as two to four feet. The walks
in all but a few instances aire
now clear.
In order to facilitate tihe
clearing of the streets of the
rapid accumulation of water,
Chief of Police McNiece. act
ing in his dual capacity of
street commissioner, has had
a force of men busily engaged
with pick and shovel remov
ing snow from the curbs, in
order to make a free channel,
and clearing away the ice
which closed the sewer inlets.
As a result, the Water is being
rapidly taken off through the
sewer to tihe outskirts of the
city. A vast amount of Water
being daily taken off, and
is
wiith a continuance of present
weather city streets wall soon
be in fair condition.
As itlhe ground froze with
about five ifeet of moisture, the
iirfarcense amount which will
be available for the coming
crowing season augurs splen

The Feast
The
of
Little Lanterns
Chinese Operetta by a Home
Talent Cast of Twenty-five
Was a Brilliant Success.
Probably the most preten
tious honte tal: nt production
occurring in this end of the
state took place at the opera
house yesterday evening when
"The Feast of the Little Lan
terns", a Chinese operetta in
acts, w"as given by a bevy
of twenty-five fair maids of
'.he 'city schools, undsr the
capable direction of Miss Al
ice Kohlars, of the English de
partment.
The production revealed ex
cellent histriorrc talent on the
part of the performers, which
was especially evident in the
nkndid fashion in w'hioh the
rrAin characters, Irene Eide as
Princess Chan Eleanor Wall
as Mai Ku L.ilas McColeiwan
Wee Ling and Freda
Brault as Ow Long, handled
their difficult parts. Each
proved herself a youthful pri
rrh donna in the making.1
They were supported by a
chorus ensemlble of twenty-one
dainty "Chinese" rrfaiids, and
all were arrayed in picturesque
hinese costume. Individual
make-ups were perfect, even
to the oblique eyebrows and
'peculiar hairdress, giving a
most realistic effect. Each
•member of the chorus carried
a Chinese lantern and fan,
wihich were waved in rythmic
unison in the chorus response.
All played their parts with a
rare zest and symjpathy espe
cially praiseworthy.The stage
was appropriately decorated
fn Oriental style. Foster's or
chestra rendered several num
bers and accompanied the
chorus.
The operetta was the direct
result of much real and con
scientious work on the part of
both directress and cast.
FolkivMing is the prologue in
brief:
"The ancestral estate of
Prince Chan is held in trust
until the night of the Feast of
the Little Lanterns, when it
shall be given over to any two
surviving children. Princess
Chan, having lost her brother
and sister When they were all
children at play in the moun
tain summer-home of the
Prince, is in great sorrow at
the thought of losing her home
wihich, however, is saved for
her.
"The first act opens with
iihe celebration of the Feast of
f.he Little Lanterns, various
legends being Woven into the
f.ext
of the songs. The Gov
erness who would regulate af
fairs of children in China, and
the little maid wflic- adores her
n^stress. cause some am*use
ment and entertainment.
Then the surprise for the
Princess is introduced in the
person of the little Japanese
juggler girl, who pleases them
mightily until summoned to
the palace. The chorus de
parts and the curtain falls
with the sorrowing Princess
alone in the garden.
"In the second act the Prin
cess is discovered still alone
'and lamenting. The chorus
comes back with Lee Wing
