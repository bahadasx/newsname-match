W. H. Fitts Reports Outlook Good
In Upper Country—Rigors of
Hard Winter.
Toe Mackav Miner rep rt» an inter
esting interview witn ;v. H Fitts,
the Custer Slid.^mining man, who re
ren ly arrived in that town after a
120 mile journey. The minets on,
Jo-dan creek. Mr. Fitts was five
day- making the trip out from 8un
b-ain and relate an Interesting ac
count uf winter-real winter, in fact,
the hardest winter, old-timers the
earliest inhabitants, are willing to
admit, tiiat lias visited that section
since the white men took up his
abode there.
Une whole dav was spent In fighlng
the drifts from Sunbeam to Bonanza,
on snowshoes, ttien another day pas
sed going from there to Robinson
far on the stage. He reports eight
teet of snow on the level at Sunbeam,
six at Bonanza arjtl five at Robinson
Bar, with the depth gradually lessen
ing on down to Clayton and Cbailis.
The thermometer lias registered bo
below at S'anley during the winter,
while it dropped to 5ô at Bonanza
and 2» at Sunbeam.
Mr. Kitts lias been fighting winter
for four months and though winter
came in that country a month earlier
than usual, setting in in October, tie
managed to have tiie new mile aerial
tram almost completely installed,
us hut two more weeks work will tie
n cessary to put in running condition
in the spring. The eotlre power
plant has been rebuilt and is in first
class running condition and is dellv -1
ering 23 000 volts over the long tra"s
mi-sion line. All that now remains!
to be done before active operations
of the entite plant is the general
overhauling of the hig mill and the
installation of some new machinery
in tiie mill. •
The Montana mine has been tiie
center uf operations during tiie win
ter months and Mr..Fitts says it Is
looking fine. This is Hie property
from which the duilar-a-pound ship
ment of ore was taken, which was
freighted to Muckay last fall.
With the record fall of snow .In tiie
.Salmon counry Mr. Fitts calculates
that tiie country will be mighty
lucky in the sprng, when Hie higii
wate' comes down, if ail the bridges
on Salmon river are not washed
away.
Mr. Fitts informed Hie Miner that
the whole country began moving with
the thaw last Monday and the slides
will endanger travel for weeks to
come.
The company will begin operations
of the mines, mills and power plant
as early In the spring as Hie weather
will permit, working a large crew.
This is one of the big gold mines of
Idaho and will make the world sit up
and take notice during tiie coming
summer.

i
President. Wilson paid «.tribute of re- j
«pect to Congressman Maun and ;
sought to impress uis audience with
the fact that all partisau. feeling
ahould*'be excluded In dealing with
the question of National .Prepared
ness. Mr Mann Is the Republican
leader in the House, lie! has patri
otically taken his stand with the
Democratic president In behalf of
Preparedness, and his noble speech
Is published in The Recorder because
It affords so much food f.r reflection
in the serious situation In which the
President finds the country. With ut
regard to partisan politics or exped
iency Mr. Mann ia supporting Mr.
Wilson.
Mr.Mann tells why it Is wise for
us now to begin our preparation - "
He makes ttie point that, "if Eu
rope's fighting nations can wipe out
party lines to prosecute war, so can
the United States to prevent war,"
and that "home Industries should
be strengthened jus part of oui Na
tional Defense plan "
Mr. Mann. Mr. Speaker, in the
quietude of my garden last summer
and autumn 1 reached certain conclu
slons which 1 have hesitated to ex
press, thinking that 1 night modify
tlaem. But as time has gone on
aru j j
events have occurred it has seemed
to me more eeitain that my conclu
sions were right than een when 1
first readied them, and 1 think, in
justice to uiyself, ami I hope with
some slight benefit to the country, I
ought to express those conclusions to
the House.
It Is well known In the House that
I never have lieen a believer in a
large standing am y, and 1 suppose
that 1 have« been, probably properly
classed in what Is sometimes referred
to as ttie "little Navy men." But
wise men ought to he able to peer,
maybe indistinctly, Into the future,
and to prepare today fur what may
come tomorrow. The world is in the
most anomalous condition which
m (»kind has ever seen. The great
est struggle of all Hie ages is going i
on now between the most powerful
forces of the human race, between j
great nations and combinations of
nations, until we are the only large,
powerful nation not yet Involved In
tiiat struggle. It Is a breakup In the
world, each side nor merely fighting
for Its own existence as It believes,
but as it seems to rue, each side
fighting with the determination to
put tbe other side, as it were, out of
business. We have never had such a
thlng in the world before, with the |
same powerful Infiutnces at work.
. The laws of civilization, Interna
tlonal laws, the laws of humanity,
; are usually disregarded, at le ist more
or less, when two gieat force* are
fighting for mastery With two men
fighting, each believing that he is
fighting for his life, each determined
j to take the life of the other, neither
pays much attention to the desires,
the requests or the demands of some
less powerful person not engaged in
the conflict.
I do not knew, and no one knows.
what will result from the present
war. No one knows whether tbe ag
gression of one side or tiie other
against our interests, may possibly,
agalost our désir» and contrary to
our wishes now, finally lead us. per
haps riot into this struggle but Into
some struggle which 1« the outcome
of this one. 1 doubt whether a paper
peace betw«?en the two struggling
parties now, even *f It could lie eD
tered Into would be even Hie begin
nlng of the end. I think ttie present
cofifitet is likely to last for many
years before It is definitely deter
mined either that one side or the
other i* toe master or that neither
can beco ue ttie master. Ann it
seems to me that the part ( m tali
for us I» to fairly prepare ourselves
fur any possible trouble whicu may
come. Loud applause.
It may be that we will have nu
trouble. 1 hope not. In this war I
an, neutral 1 think we ought to
maintain peace at all hazard*. And
yet the time may come when we win
not ha*e the déterminât! ,n whether
«e can maintain pea<e or not. be
carte, however much we may d*-»fre
peace, it is cot wlthiu our power,
with me feelings wnich we have, to
stand aggression too far. It will be
expensive prepare peace.
years ago a billion dollar* seemed a
very large sum of money. No one
would have believed two ye ire ago
that either England or Germany
could carry on a war at the expense
already involved, amounting to bll
liens of dollar», an expense so great
that Hie interest on the indebtedness
would be sufficient ordinarily to
maintain the Government work.
And the end of that Indebtedness Is
not in sight. What may come out of
such Immense burdens of debt In
these countries, even when peace
may be declared, no one can tell.
Revolutions are not improbable, and
revolutions In the history of the
world ha«e usually lead to aggression
and disputes, and often to war with
other countries. We can better af
ford today to »pend hundreds of mil
lions of dollars, or a few billions of
dollars, in ample preparations f <r
trouble, and avoid it if poss.hle, than
we can to wait for trouble and then
spend untold billions before we are
finally victors, as we would be. (Ap
plause.) If we are involved in no
trouble we will be getting oil cheaply
with tiie expenditures for prepaia
Lion. II we should he involved In
trouble the money we spend uow will
he worth many fold that which we
would spend after the trouble began.
( Applause. )
1 know the gentlemen are slncen
in their belief that there will he on
trouble. 1 sympathize with those
who ureter to spend the money of ttie
peopie in the way of Investment and
aid of our own Deople at home rather
than for the support of Idle armies or
navies. But when trouble does Come,
if ILshould come, LJiere would, be no
•lis-eiifing voice against «pending all
our mean», if necessary, to defend
our country and our homes, and it
were wise for us now, it seems to me,
to begin our preparation.
1 do not intend to discuss the de
tails, though 1 have reached the con
clusion myself that It were well, as
an emergency measure, to increase
oui regular army to 250,000 or 300, -
000, or even half a million meu (ap
plause on tbe Republican side.) that
v e should Increase or provide our
fortifications so tiiat our cists may tie
fairly, amply protected, and that we
should provide a navy which will be
able to defend us on the sea. I have
much more fear In the end of war
with England th»n 1 nave of war
with Germany. (Applau«e.)
Events are comlug rapidly In the
world. We u ay vit by and wait in
contentment, and yet it 1» our duty,
as the managers uf a great country
and a powerful people, to provide for
their projection against possibilities
as well as against c> t lain lies. 1
think then, that ws ought to provide
ti ese great forces; that it ought to
be considered as an emergency Ulst
er entirely apart from Hie ordinary
routine or expense of Government,
wit, boot regard to partisanship m
pirty hues. (Applause.) If England
and France sod Germany and Italy
can consider their problems without
party lines, a country Ilka ours
ljU « ht * ble to M,,,e
partisan considerations and try all to
stsnd together, loyal to ttie country,
In the effort to aid the Administra
tlon of tne Government.
I think, (urtner, that we ought to
provide in some way for Hie building
op and the strengthening of our
home Industrie«, so that If *e shall
i«com Involved Id war we may be
able to live within ourseDes. (Ap
plause., And 1 think as 1er as po*
»Ihle that question sbouiu be consid
-rei entirely apart from former par
tlsin opinion, In the hope thsl
sume way we may get together in the
Interest of ou r country. H w* should
become Involved in a «truggle with
foreign power.
1 have sp ken thus very briefly, not
with rhetoric or fancy phrase, be
cause it seerus to me tiiat It there

Country when we ought to Invite and
receive <»xpr<?s*ioni« of opinion from

Club.
The meeting of the woman's club
was held on Wednesday afternoon at
the home of Mr* Fred Crandall.
Roy B. Herndon appeared before the
club and discussed some of he ids
lurica! lealures of Lemhi countv and
ths Importance of their being
brought before the state historical so
clety through the historical depart
ment of the state federation of wom
an's clubs. This department Is do
ing a great work in preserving and
recording the landmarks or valuable
historical events of Idaho and as
Lemhi is an Important county iu tin*
respect, and as there are at least two
! iisLn le» of Idaho being wri'ten at
the present time, It 1» especially Im
portant that this work be aueuded
to at once iu order to get proper rec

REV. E.N. QUIST
ON JUSTIFICATION
I
Kor bis Sunday eveunlg discourse
Rev. E. N. (gulst spoke ou justifica
tion, in wnich he enumerated four
elements.
First, grace the source "Belüg
justified freely by his grace through
the redemption that Is ln Christ
Jeans." Rom 3:23. This grace Is a
free gift of God, regardless of our uu
worthiness. We could not begin to
merit grace. "For if by grace, ihen
is It no more work»; otherwise grace
Is no more grace."
Secondly, "blood" is the esuse.
Much more then, being now justi
fied by his blood, we shah be saved
from «rath through him!" Rum.
5:U. We are told In Hebrew« U:'22
that "Without sheddlug of blood
there is no remission." Therefore
we must make much of the blood ul
Christ.
Thirdly, fi»llh Is the appropriation
uf Hiis great gift. "And by him all
that believe are justified from all
things, from which ye could not be
justified by • lie law of Moses." Acts
13.3k. Not feeling but faith Is re
quired. il U simply believing God
land his promises In tthe same way
that we believe one of our most
trustworthy friends. Ws believe that
He has forgiven our sins just because
we have Ids word for It.
l-ourthly, works Is the mauifesta
tion of our faith. "But wilt tnou
know. O «alu man. Hint faith with
out works Is dead'" Jas. 2 2b No
man can serve the Lord acceptably
until he accepts Christ as his Savior.
All service after Hist Is a service of
love, and out of necessity. "If ye
love me ye will keep my command
mente" said Christ to Ids followers.
W« strive to do His wilt because we
love him. "We love God because he
first loved us." Let us remember,
however, that this work of love due«
not help to »ave us "W> are saved
by grace through faith: sud that not
of yourselves ; It Is the gift of God."
Eph. 2:8.

SALMON IS BEST
STOCK COUNTRY
Advantage of Location to Make
This a Great Sheep Shippinf
Point-From Rang* to Cars.
Salmon I« destined to become one
of tue greatest shipping points In all
ttie country, In the opinion of well
Informed dock masters livre The
cm at n, cion of a short railroad gap is
what will make it, so, t- ey »ay
Vast ranges on tue U -cky Moun
tains are «till unappropriated, except
bv cattle, which use not all of the
range* by any means Thee» ranges
extend both ea*t and west all along
the Stimuli and Lemhi riven and
their trlhutart s. For bund.eds o t
mile* they are still untrodden except
by wild mountain sheep and goeta,
irgely uuadspted to [Cattle hut well
suited for the u* of domestic sheep.
Forage and underbrush as well as
gra»« afford i scellent feed for sheep
and abounds right down to the limits
>>f Salmon and the nearby valleys
What is required to make this feed
available I» that little connecting
link of railroad track to book up the
Gilmore and Pittsburg, which Is a
holding of lb* Northern Pacific with
the Northern Pacific's transrontlnnn
tal line.
This road extends nearly from end
to end of Lemhi county with a spur
acru»s the continental divide connect
ing with the Union Pacific system
at Armstead. The two roads do not
w rk together In harmony, however,
i* I» not expected they should. In
fact they have xcpaiate depots at
Armstead a mile wpart. but iron:
that place on to Twin Bridges la only
forty odd miles and at that place the
Northern Pscific tracks could be
Joined. The building of this missing
link would distinctively place Salmon
on tiie railroad map uf the country
ami work an luimrnse saving iu time
in getting sheep to Hie eastern mark
ets. at least a day or two early than
by through the Pocatello gateway
over the Short Line. To thla advan
tage would come also the further and
greater consideration of taking sheep
almost directly from their ranges for
loading without the long and wear
ing drives across desert» ur along con
gested trails. From this uolnt with
ibe»e advantages sheep would start
iway in mudi laitier condition than
Is possible from almost ail other Ida
ho point» of shipment.
Drive over a desert or a starved off
trail has always been the dread of
the dock masters.
Farmer here In all the Salmon and
Lemhi river valleys are turning their
attention to tbe production of hay In
anticipation of Hie growing demand
