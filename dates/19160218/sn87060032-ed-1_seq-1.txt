George Washington
"The great Republic had its birth
That hour beneath the Army's
wing,
Whose leader taught by native
worth
The man is grander than the
King." Wallace Brace.
There never has been a time
since the days of the great com
prehensive Washington when it
was not good for us to remember
him and his preeminent charac
ter and to treasure the memory
of the part he and our ancestors
bore in their united struggle for
National Independence.
It is well that this day, (the
22. of February) has been set
aDart as a national holiday
f-or

mlmlanml c,mvincrnurdoon sense '
of the value and importance 0fjd
their achievments. i
It is well to remember it with i
thnnkc n fl Oivor of .-ill ffood ,
gifts, to the Ruler of the desti
nies of nations, from whose wis
dom George Washington and the
patroits received guidance and
power to inspire each-other.
His was a day when true politics
was enlarged morality. His was
a day When the hearts of the
people beat as one. ' 'Agression
began the Revolution, necessity
unsheltered the sword and victory
returned it."
An act of congress made George
Washington the commander of
the American Army. He became
our bulwark and nur fortress.
He took upon his shoulden, in
the possible and very probable
case of disaster and ruin, our
ignominy and punishment. His
'great Honest and self sacrificing
nature his spotless character and
true nobility inspired his coun
trymen with the best and first
sentiments of their own natures,
How glorious it is lo recall the
eventful history and hear the in
spired voice of James Otis sound
the key note of resistence when
he says, "I will resist to the hour
of death such injustice." To hear
the call to arms of Patrick Henry
when he says, 'Our brothers of
thd North are already in the field
aa for me-Give me liberty or
give me death. ' I have it hand
ed down to me by word of mouth
from myforefathers who were

that speech (one of the seven
greatest of oratorical achevement
there radiated from his head
sparks of moving light. Let ir
reverent people jeer at this, let
them jeer at the infant lips of
George Washington when he
said, "I cannot speak a lie" hut
they are truths that children can
understand
To speak as these
men spoke
was to defy their mother country
and the! -by rend their own hearts
and it meant apparently nothing
less than death but their words
had to come. Each and every
t one lived up to the best in their
' nature and if it was only one deed
one hour or one day they served
' their makers purpose and their
Country's need, let us be chari
table to all and remember them
with love for the good
they did

who to iraiianuy roue me oiac

ed from the top of the steeps to
his General below "Saratoga is
saved." How glorious to hear
the voice of Webster exclaim
"Give me a country, at least the
hope ofa country, and that a
Free country."
It remained to George Wash
ington to combine all the separ
ate virtues into one and present
to the world a character which
was above political temptation, a
character which was a blessing
to humanity and mutely declared
to the world It is better to be a
man than a king. It was then
that the starry eyed goddess of
Democracy was born and the Re
publican form of- Government
arose above the battle smoke of
the valleys and the mountains
and the clear starry heavens de
clared the brotherhood of of man.
The words of Henry Lee declare
of Washington, "Tho first in war
the first in peace and the first in
the' hearts of his Countrymen."
I repeat there has never been a
time that it was not good for us
to remember George Washington
and there never has been a time
when we need his example and
advice more than to day. War
enveloped Europe in front of us,
war enveloped Canada above us,
war enveloped Mixico south of
us; this is assuredly a time when I

SallieLyttle Hutton,
Discusses Prohibition
Knoxfork, K.v.
February 12, HUG
To tho renders of the Advocate:
The editor has requested a
general discussion through tho
colums of our paper, of the li
quor traffic with reference to
state-wide prohibition, and if my
few remarks are printable 1 will
say that I am not the least bit
embarrassed to stand upon, not
only state-w'de, but national pro
hibition. Not that I am condeming tho
"county-unit"; no sir, far from
it, but a child has to crawl be
fore it can wiiik. So we must
let that be our first step toward
something better, and while the
county unit bill was a grett
stride towaid eliminating thib
great curse yet we mus- not sit
down and bay ait is done, but let
us strive to get our legislators to
pass an act, submitting to the
people the question of State-wide
prohibition.
I do not see what argument
those who advocate the manfac
turc and sale of intoxicants can
bring to their defense, for it
seems to me a very one sided
question.
Some of those on the other
side say that it iff the medical
properties that makes it useful,
but NO, the medical fraternities
and societies of the United
States have marked alcohol and
whiskey off their list as medicine
claiming that it has no medical
value whatever.
Also some people say that we
should keep the "booze" with
us, because of the revenues it
j pays to the State. Well let's see
about that. Figures show that I
the cost of keeping our prisons, '
asylums, and criminal institu
tions, together with criminal
prosecutions of the courts, 1.
500,000 each year. And great!
judges and jurists sa that at I
least SO per cent of the c. imes,
insanity and pauperism cai. be
traced to the "liquor traffic", i
that he true, it can be readily
seen that to take SO per cent of
$1,500,000 would equal to $1,200,
000 extra expense incured to the
State. And as the whiskey and '
liquor revenue from all souices,
is only $000,000 1 fail to sec
where the revenue is that would
be on tho credit side of the.
State treasury. t
The saloon men say that State
prohibition will not eradicate all '
illicit distilling and moonshining; :
neither does sending a person to
the gallows or electric chair pro
hibit an occasional murder being!
committed. Yet we do kuow
that State wide prohibition '
would reduce all lawlessness to a
minimum, and our executive
officials would have more time
and could more easily locate, all
blind tigers and bootleggers.

Court at Williamsburg Monday.
Judge Sampson Almost Continually
on the Job as Judge of this District
This week completes a twelve
days session of Circuit Court at
Whitley City, McCreary County,
and court will convene at Wil
liamsburg next Monday. At the
close of our court here in Kncx
County, February 5th, Judge
Sampson went on the Monday
following and convened court in
McCreary County for a two weeks
Term, finishing his court there
this week.
The docket of each of his
courts is being rapidly cleard up.
There are no important murder
cases as of former days, and
very few felony charges to try.
The Judge with the assistance of
our able and fearless Common
wealth's Attorney, with the as
sistance also of a good County
ttorney in each of the Counties
of the District is gradually but
surely reducing the number of
petit crimes and misdemeanors.
Judge Sampson is a terror to law
violators, yet as everyone knows,
who has been in his courts, he is
just as vigilent to see that the
innocent man escapes punish
ment as he is to have the guilty

This clearing the docket is a'
great advantage to the whole
people, not only in the getting
rid of so much crime and lawless
ness which has been so common,
and the lessening of which re
sults in a great moral uplift to
the community, this affords also
more time in the courts for the
trial and disposition of civil suits.
Thelpeople who have cases in
court are entitled to have them
tried.
