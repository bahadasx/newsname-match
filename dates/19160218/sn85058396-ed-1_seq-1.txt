attempt to retake the position south
west of Ypres, Belgium, recently .cap
tured by the Germans, but were beat

Review of War Situation.
1 The Russian war office has offi
cially announced 4thc capture of
Erzerum from the Turks, but has fur
nished no details. . .
In the major fields ot war, west
i' and east, there has been no activity
r of an important" nature, so far as of
- ficial reports show.
j Much speculation regarding, the
U probable further course of events in
gl the campaign about Erzerum is being
Indulged in. One report says the
Russians have pushed a force north
west from Erzerum and that this
boilv of troops already has reached
Daiburt, 75 miles away on the road
lo Trebizond.
Mutiny of Hindus.
Reports of a mutiny of Hindu
troops In Egypt came today through
German channels. A circumstantial
account publishes in a Cologne news-
paper declares that an entire regi
' ment mutinied. Twelve British offi
cers, including the commander of the
lesimeiu and a major were killed, ac
cording to the account.
The reports add that the British
command In Egypt has ordered the
withdrawal from the Suez canal of
all Mohammedan troops.
The British evidently are restive
under the continued occupation by
the Germans of the several hundred
yards of a first line trench south of
Ypres, Belgium, lost in recent fight
ing. Berlin today reports another at
tempt by the British to retake the po
sition but declares the effort failed
with heavy losses.
South of the Somme a fresh altacK
by the French also failed, according
to Berlin.
It is announced that Premier As
qullh will ask a new vote of credit of
400,000,000 pounds in the British house
9 of commons next Monday.

northern Holland. Last night the

MOST BRILLIANT
FEAT OF THE WAR
Capture of First Class Fortress,
Erzerum, by Bayonet At
tack an Unprecedented
Spectacle.
TURKS ARE SURPRISED
Highest Tribute Paid to Brav
ery of Caucasian Troops
Name Will Go Down in
History.
Petrograd, Feb 18, via I-ondon,
2:20 p. m. The fall of Erzerum, the
most important Turkish stronghold in
Asia Minor and for a long time con
sidered Impregnable, offers the un
precedented spectacle of a first class
fortress built on a steep mountain
ridge nearly a mile above sea level
ielding to bayonet attack after only
thirty-six hours bombardment
The operations were conducted un
der the most severe weather condi
tions, the snow being deep and the
thermometer registering at times
more than thirty degrees below zero
Fahrenheit
Russians Surprise Turks.
The Turkish army defending
Erzerum, taken by surprise under the
methods adopted by the Russians, is
now said to be in disorderly flight on
the roads leading to Sivas. As the
garrison apparently scattered In all
directions, it is assumed here that
large numbers of men were taken
prisoner, although official figures
still are lacking.
After the taking of Niksala, It ap
peared that the Russian attack would
be directed upon the Turkish right
flank, and, by rapidly transforming
troops, the Turks made all plans to
resist the main assault from this quar
ter Apparently they had little fear
of the success of this attack because
of the strong character of the fortifi
cations in thut direction and even less
i.pprehension of danger from a front
al attack.
Most Brilliant Feat of War.
Nevertheless, after the Russians
took by storm the first lino forts on
February 2 there began a persistent
bombardment of the Turkish center,
followed by a. bayonet charge, the im
petuosity of which swept the defend
ers off their feet. The highest trib
ute is paid to the bravery of the Cau
casian troops, whose charge is consid
ered likely to go down in history as
one of the most brilliant feats of the
It' is recognized here that the suc
cess of the assault was due. almost en
tirely to the bayonet work of these
troops, since the artillery prepara
tion was insufficient in intensity and
duration, according to military ex
perts, to reduce even a strong field
position.
Turkish Campaign Disrupted.
The wiping out of this Turkish base
tends to disrupt the whole Caucasus
campaign of the Turks as It not only
served as a base of the operations n
the Caucasus but also of those In
Mesopotamia. Its fall leaves no
s rongly fortified point between
ErTenim and Slvas, about 230 miles
to the west, and brings more to the
front consideration of an eventual
attack upon Constantinople from the
eaAn attempt to retake Erzerum "is
anticipated, but there are enormous
difficulties attending the bringing up
of Turkish reinforcements, as it is
assumed that Turkish forces i In Meso
potamia cannot bo spared. The alter
SaUvo for the Turks seems to be to
Saw upon those at Constantinople,
from which all possible routes to
S?rds Erzerum are long and arduous
Tl e most practicable is by railway to
Sfa whence it would be necessary
to march overland more than 200
miles The Black sea route to Tre
bteond has become impracticable be
cause o" the Russian domination of
the Black sea littoral. .
Sivaa is regarded as the next prob-
k
able objective of, the Russian armies.
The capture of Erzerum has had the
effect of making more secure the
Russian positions along the Black sea
coast and those of the southern flank
at Alashgerd, while the possibility of
a successful Russian thrust towards
the British expeditionary force in
Mesopotamia seehis to be increasing.
The victory is taken by the Russian
military authorities as the first signal
idken of successful co-operation
among the allies. This belief Is ex
pressed in interviews by diplomats
of the allied powers in Petrograd.
Although the official bulletin men
lions 70 guns captured, it Is known
that the fortress contained 300 new
pattern Krupp heavy guns, besides an
equal number of an older pattern. It
is assumed these were abandoned
and, from the precipitate nature of
the' evacuation, it is not believed the
Turks took time seriously to disable
them.
Emperor Nicholas Congratulated.
London, Feb. 18, 10: -15 a. m. On
receipt of the news of the capture of
Erzerum by the Russians, King
George dispatched the following mess
age to Emperor Nicholas:
'My heartiest congratulations upon
the splendid achievement of your gal

Berlin Confirms Erzerum's Fall.
Berlin, Feb. IS, via London, 1:48 p.
m. The Berlin newspapers of this
afternoon generally accept as true
the announcement from Petrograd of
the capture of Erzerum although it
has not been confirmed from Turk
ish sources. The press is inclined to
minimize the importance of tho Rus
sian success.
The Lokal Anzeiger says the forts
a Erzerum were old and probably
contained no guns that were not built
more than twenty years ago. It points
out that the mountain ous district to
'the west of Erzerum makes possible
effective opposition by the Turks to
pursuing Russians.
The Tageblat thinks the political
results may be more important than
the military consequences. It believes
the effect on the military situation
will not bo great as the fortress can
serve the Russians for only unim
portant local operations.

Strict Watch Kept Along AH

to be directed against Danish merch
