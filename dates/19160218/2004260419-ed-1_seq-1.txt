Ho was born In Chicago Heights, Illi
nois, October 2ti, 1859, and in 1 Still,
when nearly seven years of age, came

JAMES A. KAKIN
grow up on tho farm, attending the
county school nearby. Afterwards,
bo attended High School and college
at Kugeno for six years, working on
the farm during vacations. After
completing tho college courue, he
went to I n Ion and entered the law
oftlco of Ills brother, Robert Kukln,
now ono of tho Justices of the Su
premo court where he studied and
practiced law for livo years.
In 1887 lie was married to Clara
M. Adams of Portland, a mimihcr of
one of the leading pioneer families of

and is regarded highly by the mem

lighted to have your votes. The next

There Is nothing worth while ob
tained in this world without energetic
and thoughtful effort and to become
the victor in this contest and receive
the reward that goes with It Is worth

make it continuous and determined.

ered out of the running as all have
been doing some work and will make
the contest interesting for those who
already have a good start.

ing merchants are Interested in this
