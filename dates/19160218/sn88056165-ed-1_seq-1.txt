TO CANALIZE •
THE RIVERS
Congressman McCracken In
troduces Bill to Engineer
Snake and Clearwater Riv
ers for Later Development.
The Commercial club-is in re
ceipt of a copy of a bill introduc
ed by Congressman McCracken,
of Idaho, dealing with the im
provement of the Snake and Co
lumbia rivers for navigation as
well as power purposes. The bill
is the one approved by wate, ways
adv cat as of the northwest as af
fording the next logical step in
ths improvement of the rivers
follo^ÿng the completion of The
Dalies-Celilo canal. By its terms
a commission of five engineers
will be appointed to make a thor
ough examination of the Colum
bia and Snake rivers from Celilo
to Pittsburg Landing, 70 miles
above Lewistan, and of the Clear
water from Lewiston to Orofino.
These engineers will gather ex
tensive data in connection with
the proposed canalization of the
Snake and Columbia rivers
through the construction of a
system of dams which will flood
out the rapids and as well develop
a large water power which can
be used for miscellaneous pur
poses. This was the plan advo
cated by Joseph N. Teal, of Port
land, who is so well known in
connection with his long and ef
fective work in behalf of an open
river to the sea. The govern
ment now has extensive prelimi
nary data on the subject and the
commission authorized*by the bill
will be able to complete their
work in order to make a report
by the time of the next session.
The preliminary investigation has
indicated that there will be ten
dams installed between Lewiston
and Celilo and that one of these
will be located at Dry Gulch a
bout four miles below Lewiston
where a dam would develop 50,
0 0 horsepower and as well flood
oit several rapids between the
city and that point.
C ngressman McCracken writes
that he has included the Clear
wa er river in the bill so that full
data might be secured as to that
stream, leaving no doubt as toits
advailability or non-availibility
after the engineers have made
the thorough investigation that
tl e bill contemplates.
Congressman McCracken also
advises that he has received let
ters from all the members of the
Washington and Oregon delega
tions assuring their support for
the measure with expressions of
their confidence that the bill will
pass. ' The bill on February 3 was
referred to the committee on
rivers and harbors.
The introduction of this meas
ure can be received with rejoic
ing by the friends of the open
river movement because it initi
• ates a work more extensive in its
character than The Dalies-Celilo
canal which was completed last
year after an outlay of $5,000,000
had been made. With the canal
ization scheme completed as plan
ned United States engineers state
that boats of two to four hundred
tons capacity can conveniently
maintain the run between Lewis
ton and the sea at all seasons of
the year.
The class of work to be done
by the engineering comission
provided in the McCracken bill is
suggested by the fact that $50,
000 is to be allotted for the work
independent of salaries of $6,000
each which the engineers shall
receive. These engineers are to
be selected from the United
States engineer corps, the United
States reclamation service and

Ice Gorges
All of the smaller streams that
enter in the South Fork from the
west are at a high water mark
and for the past two days have
been disgorging large quantities
of ice. Yesterday morning a
larger gorge than usual broke
loose from Cottonwood creek
came into the Clearwater, bring
ing down what ice had formed in
that stream as far as the bridge
where it gorged for a short time,
raising the water to some extent
but doing no damage. This gorge
broke early in thé morning and
went down below the slaughter
1 ojse where it again gorged
This time it raised the water on
the west side of the river until
Laurance Howard's house had
three feet of water on the floors
and Mrs. Earl Steen's, two feet.
Both families had left before the
water reached them. In the aft
ernoon the gorge broke, moving
down to about the Brown place
where it is still gorged. Railroad
officials say this gorge is about 12
feet deep, 200 feet wide and a
quarter of a mile long. It is
feared that much damage will be
done when it breaks as the ice is
solid in the Middle Fork and seri
ous gorges may occur there.—
Stites Enterprise.
Speaking of the break-up on
the lower river, Saturday's Lew
iston Tribune says: Ice jams be
tween Kooskia and Agatha held
the flood waters in check for
hours and at some points the rail
road track was threatened but
the reports last night indicated
all of the jams have broken and
the water is running freely and
receding at all points. The ferry,
between Kooskia and Kamiah
was carried out, the ferry at
Myrtle was crushed by ice and
the ferry at Fir Bluff is reported
missing.
The passing of the ice yester
day presented a wonderful spec
tacle for the Lewiston citizens
and large numbers gathered along
the railroad dyke and at the
Clearwater bridge. At one time
the entire channel was a mass of
moving ice for as far as the eye
could see. The ice was forced
upward for about four feet above
the natural level of the water
and was jammed so closely to
gether that no water, was to be
seen.

Mr.
Parents-Teachers Asso
ciation Formed
The second meeting of the par
ents-teachers association was
held last Friday afternoon at the
high school and was quite well
attended, resulting in the organi
zation of the association and the
election of the following officers:
Mrs. R. A. Nims, president; Mrs.
A. MacMaster, vice president;
Mrs. E. M. Parker, secretary
treasurer; Mrs. Nims, Miss Elva
Gray and Mrs. Fred Simon, pro
gram committee. The regular
meetings of the association will
be held on the first and third Fri
days of each month at the school
house at 3 o'clock p. m., the first
meeting to be a business session
and the last a literary or educa
tional meeting. At the latter a
program will be rendered, con
sisting of readings, papers, round
table talks, etc. Quite a bit of
interest is being shown in the as
sociation and it is probable that
an affiliation will later be made
with the national association.
Anyone interested in the welfare
of the school is eligible to mem
bership.

Ferdinand Farmer Says
Silage is the Ideal Ration
a
A short time since the editor
wrote to Mr. Herman Hanson, of
Ferdinand, asking for informa
tion regarding the latter's experi
ence with the silo which he erect
ed last summer and what results
he had obtained from feeding
ensilage to his farm stock during
the winter season. Mr. Hanson's
reply, under date of Feb. 12, fol
lows:
Your letter of dan. 24th at
hand and in reply will say that I
have had so much to do that I
have not been able to get at your
request sooner, however, it cef
tainly was a pleasure to me to
have some one ask for such a re
port, as it makes me feel that
there are others who are inter
ested in the silo.
"My silo was filled with a com
bination of peas and oats, which
certainly makes Borne feed, how
ever, I had some oats alone for a
test and the stock did not like it
as well as the peas and oats. I
seeded the peas and oats with ar.
ordinary grain drill, sowing 65
pounds of peas and 35 pounds of
oats to the acre, which made a
very nice proportion as there was
just enough oats to make some
thing for the peas to climb on, so
it was no trouble to cut the crop
with an ordinary binder and made
the harvesting very easy. I seed
ed 5i acres, measured ground,
and, as my silo is a 10x24 foot
structure with a 34-ton corn silage
capacity. I have placed the ton
nage of peas and oats at 32 tons,
this ensilage being lighter than
corn, which would make the yield
a strong six tons per acre. From
this one can plainly see that they
are able to get a great deal more
feed per acre by using the silo
method, to say nothing of the
quality of the feed as compared
with dry hay. The cost of cut
ting my crop with the binder and
putting it into the silo did not
Another Business Change
It is with pleasure that we are
able to announce this week an
other slight business change in
our city whereby Mr. Thos. J.
'Parker becomes affiliated with his
brother, E. L. Parker, in the
mercantile life of Cottonwood.
Mr. Parker came here last fall
from Nebraska with a view of
locating somewhere in this part
of the westland, after spending
the winter here and acquainting
himself;with r local conditions, de
cided.he'couldldo'aslwell in Cot

exceed 90 cents per ton.
"When I was ready to start
feeding the ensilage I had to re
move about 17 inches of the sur
face which had spoiled, but have
found nothing more that I have
had to throw away, so the loss
from molding or - other causes
was practically nothing. In fact,
the top layer which I did throw
away was almost entirely cleaned
up by the hogs so that I can
figure not to exceed 500 pounds
of loss all told. We have been
feeding stock cattle, milk cows,
stock hogs and fattening hogs on
the ensilage and it has proven
very good in every instance
The stock cattle were fed about
10 pounds per head twice a day
for grown stock, younger stock
in proportion, and the milk cows
about 30 pounds per day. and I
want to say that my stock cattle
have come along far better this
winter than ever before, and
always fed good hay, too. My
milk cows have given about one
third to one-half better quality
of milk and 25 to 30 per cent
more in quantity, so you can plain
ly see there is nothing against
the silo but everything is in its
favor. I feel that as soon as the
farmers on the prairie see what
the silo means they will no more
try to get along without one than
they would without a plow.
"There is no doubt in my mind
but that the silo business in this
country will be very good the
coming summer and I feel that
this is one thing the farmer can
buy without going wrong, as
they can put any kind of feed in
one and have from 40 to 50 per
cent better and more feed per
acre than they can the old way.

little of the information desired,
I remain,
Yours very truly,
HERMAN I. HANSON."

stead.
The change in the firm name
will be practically the only change
noticeable in the Parker store
and people of this locality will
receive the same courteous treat
ment and value for their money
as they have in the past.
We are glad to see Mr. Parker
become a permanent resident of
our city and feel certain he will
prove a man of real worth to this
community.
