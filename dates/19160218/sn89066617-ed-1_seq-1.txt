Arthur Ives and Dela Long
Ran Away From Chaonia
Home to Marry
GIRL TO RETURN
TO UNCLE TODAY
Walked Ties From Homes
Mingo to Catch Train
For Cape
to
Thirteen-year-old Dola Long and
seventeen-year-old Arthur Ives, who '.
ran away from their homes in Chaonia,
Wayne County, to get married, last
night were taken into custody by the J
police and after one night in the Cape
they will be started on their return
trip today. They did not cuccoed in
getting married.
They told their story to Chief Uni
son last night after tl.cy had b en
taken to police headquarters. Ti e
girl last night was taken to the home
of Mrs. William Uhl, who acts as a
police matron, and Ives was placed in
the hold-over.
Ives is a tie-chopper and has been
working near his home town. He has
been living with his parents. His
father is a tie-cutter also. The Long
girl's father, also is a tie-cutter living
in Chaonia.
They had known each other for sev
eral years and a few days ago, they
determined to gt married. Their
courtship had been marred sometime
ago when the girl's father announced
that young Ives had to stop visiting
his daughter.
It was this announcement that in
duced thr-m ti run off to get married.
When they had collected their val
uables together they met Tuesday
night and without loading themselves
r.ith much c!cthir.,' they started t
walk the railroad track for Mingo in
Stoddard County on the Hoxie line.
During the night, they stopped and
built a fire when the girl got cold,
and after resting for a while at the
side of the track, they walked on to
Mingo, arriving there early yester- j
day morning. There they purchased
tickets for the Cape.
They arrived in the Cape at 6 o'clock
last night and almost immediately aft
er treating his proposed bride to sup
per, Ives bought her a pair, of new
shoes.
He subsequently became separated
from her and was taken into custody
by a patrolman who took him to the
police station. At the police station,
he said that he had the girl to look
after and explained that the couple
had come to the Cape to get married.
He carried a photograph of the
girl in his pocket, so that the police
identified the girl wandering about on
the streets a few minutes later by the
use of the boy's photograph.
When the girl was brought to the
police station, she corroborated the
boy's story that they intended to be
married. She said that her parents
had no objections to her marriage, al
though she subsequently told how her
father had denied young Ives permis
sion to come to her house to call up
on her.
She also told Hutson that she would
rather die than be forced to return
to her home and she said -that she
would be willing to return to the home
of her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Loves, who live near Chaonia.
She will be placed on a Hoxie train
and started for her aunt's place this
morning.
When Ives was taken into custody
he had ?12 in his pockets. He also
had a slight bullet wund in the right
arm near the elbow which he told the
police had been inflicted when he got
into a tussle several days ago with
some companions over the possession
of a jmall rifle.
Ives declared that when they started
out, they had intended to go to More
house to be married. Last night he
became convinced that it would do no
good to attempt to get married in the
Cape and consented to a plan for his
return to Chaonia.

5 Cent Loaf Of
Bread Doomed Is
Belief Of Bakers
Convention at Salt Lake Is
Expected to Fix Price at
10 Cents Straight, Is Belief
of Bread Expert.
Columbus, 0., Feb. 1C That the
most important topic of discussion at
the national bakers' convention to be
held at Salt Lake City in August will
be the proposed abandonment of the
five cent loaf of bread, is the statement
of Harry Myers, one of the city's larg
est bakers, who has just returned from
a meeting of the bakers' executive
committee at Atlanta.
"Most of those who were in attend
ance upon the executive committee
meeting favor an effort at populariz
ing the ten-cent loaf of bread," said
Mi. Myers. To an outsider it may
se-i;i Ltrmjc- that it is impossible to
sell twit? the weight of bread for a
dime and make a profit when it is not
possible to sell half the weight for a
nickel and come out even. The reason
is that all the items that properly
come under the head of overhead cost
and also the labor, are no higher for
the larger loaf than for the smaller
one.
"Practically all of the manual labor
in the preparation of bread has come
to be done by machinery. Delivery
salesmanship have to be performed by
men and paid for, but the expense is
no greater for a large loaf than a
small one. It costs no more to adver
tise a large loaf than a small one.
Larger loaves also are healthier, for
the reason that they bake better and
the purchaser is more apt to eat bread
that is not warm. No warm bread is
so healthful as the same loaf when it
is twenty-four hours old."

CRAMER REBUKES
DEMOCRATS FOR
POLITICAL TRICK
Efforts to Line Up Bar Assn.
Behind Lane, Denounced
By Judge
REPUBLICAN LAWYERS
STRONG FOR SNIDER
AH Sign Statement, Urging Voters
to Elect Mr. Snider
Judge
The Republican members of th
Cape County Bar Association yester
day denounced the efforts of the Dem
ocratic members of the organization t
use the association for the benelit of
Tom Lane's candidacy for Judge of th
Common Pleas Court.
A statement, circulated by H. U.
Alexander, intimated that the mem
bers of the Bar Association, without
regard for politics, were supporting
Lane, but every signature attached to
the document was that of a Democrat.
Judge Wilson Cramer was incensed
at the unfair methods used by th
"gum drop" party, and wrote a state
ment, signed by all of the Republican
members of the Bar Association,
heartily indorsing Judge John A. Sni
der. Democrats had even circulated the
report that Judge Cramer hud an
nounced he would cast his vote for
Lane. Mr. Cramri's indorsement of
Juelge Snider's candidacy fell as a
bomb in the Democratic camp when it
became known yesterday.
The statement drafted by Mr. Cra
mer follows:
A word to the Republican voters
of Cape Girardeau County in rela
tion to the special election to be held
on the 19inst:
In an article adressed to the
voters of Cape Girardeau County
appearing in the Daily Republican
of February 15, and signed by a
number of attorneys advocating the
election of the Hon. Thomas F.
Lane, the Democratic nominee for
the office of Judge of the Cape Gir
ardeau Court of Common Pleas, ap
pears the following:
"The judicial offices of the stat
have seldom been considered or
looked upon as partisan political
positions. The law prescribes cer
tain ejualifications that a judge
mu-t have, and by reaon of the
fact meniLers of the bar come in
closer contact with judges and the
tourt thvn do any other class of
citizens, it is not unreasonable or
unusual that the member of tin
bar should express their endorse
ment of one of the soevral candi
dates in the coming election.
"As members of the bar of Cape
Girareleau County, we take this
means of endorsing the candidacy
of the Hon. Thomas F. Lane for
the office of Judge of the Capo
Girardeau Court of Common Pleas
to fill out the unexpired term of
the late Hon. Robert G. Ranney."
Which apparently depricating the
considering of judicial offices as
partisan, political positions, the
signers of this article are not frank
enough to say to the voters that
they, each and every one of them
are Democrats and make their ap
peal to the Voters of the County,
as such. ;
Since this political aspect is giv
en to the matter, we, the Repub
lican members of the bar, call up
on the Republican voters to stand
ty their nominee, the Hon. John A.
Snider. Why did you hold a con
vention to nominate a candidate
unless you intended to support him ?
There was no legal compulsion
forcing you to do so. Having nom
inated Judge Snieler as your can
didate, we think you should turn
out in full force anel vote for him if
for no other reason than to demon
strate the growing strength of the
Republican spirit. This is a parti
san appeal anel intended as such.
You all know Judge Snider. He
has serveel the County before faith
fully and well as Judge of said
Court and is a fair minded man, '
free from any kind :' of fads or
"isms." We know ofium what we
knew of Judge' RanneJ' . that he is.
honest and his heart1 is at the right
