SECOND LETTER
SEIT BY PLOTTE
Chicago Police Believe Man's
Boastfulness Will Lead
to His Arrest.
International New s Service :
CHICAGO, Feb. IS. With the
publication here today of a second
letter sent by Jean Crones to a New
York newspaper, the Chicago police
officials prosecuting the search for
the poisoner of the soup served at
the Arclvbishop Mundelein banquet,
expressed conlidence that. Crones'
hoastfulnes would be his own un
doing. They believed that the two
letters mailed in New York would
result in his capture by the Gotham
detectives.
Capt. Nicholas Hunt of the Chi
cago detective bureau, said- today
that he had positive proof that
Crones went east from here shortly
after the poisoned soup incident, but
that he gave out a statement that he
believed the poisoner and anarchbt
plotter was in Chicago in order to
mislead Crones whose only source
cf Information as to the police ac
tivity in searching for him was the
newspapers.
"From two sources." said ('apt.
Hunt, "information hr.s been brought,
to me that Crones is in New York
and that he was in Poston as recent
ly as last Wednesday night. The
I.'oston detective chief told me over
the long distanct that a waiter ree
o'Tnized Crones there, and that the
waiter begged thathis name tie kepi
secret for fear that anarchists would i
kill him. Last night, Capt. Tunney
of the New York police, telephoned
me that h had authoritative in
formation that Cones is now in or
near New York."
The writer of the letter taunts the
police. Incloses his "linger prints"
to aid thm. welcomes the coming
of Chicago detectives to assist in his
capture, tells why he attempted to
poison ."oo men and hints of some
thing he will "let go" when Chicago
detectives reach this city.
New Y'Tk city police aided by
federal serret service agents scoured
that city today "in a search for

International New Sen !:
WASHINGTON. Feb. Is. Dobian
warning that the Fnited States may
In- drawn into the war if it ac
quiesces in the German admiralty's
newly announced submuine pd;e.
wa.s deliverd on the senate üoi.r to
day by SVn. Lodgo of Massachusetts,
ranking republican member of the
foreign relations committee.
Sen. lvodge urged the administra
tion "to stand firm in its determina
tion to uphold the principle f the
right of merchantmen to arm for
defensive purpose"
The German admiralty's avowed
intention to torpedo without warn
ing armed enemy merchant vessel
after Feb. 29, is "revolting to every
instinet of humanity, to every prin
ciple of law and justice," Sea. Iodge
dei la red.
"I cannot believe that he admin
istration thinks for a moment of
altering the well de:im-d position
which it took at the outset of the
Luropean war, and I believe that It
must stand as tirmly on this ques
tion as it has n the question of
embargo," continued the Massachu
setts senator. "Should it act other
wise, it would accept a humiliation,
and incur a danger f war from
which even the boldest and the most
unscrupulous would shrink. and
therefore such a course a.s has Wn
discussed in tho newspapers seems
to l.e wholly inconceivable."
Ab andonment of the principle of
the right of a merchantman to arm
for defense- at this stage of the war
also would be a distinctly unneutral
act and would place the Fnited
States clearly in the position of mi
ally of Germany. Sen. I.dg de
clared. LONDON. Feb. v. ourt in
trigue at Perlin has arisen to mak
more serious the situation Utween
tho Fnited States and Germany.
The information concerning the in
ner jealousies of the Ib-rlin court
comes in a dispatch to the Indon
Times from a Scandinavian corre
spondent. The correspondent sas that Dr.
Solf. the colonial secretary, has am
bition to suceed to the foreign of
fice after the. war. He finds in
Count J. H. von Fernst orff, the Ger
man ambassador at Washington, the:
chief rival. Out of this situation,
tho difficulties of the Washington
negotiations grow. The efforts of
Count ven Pernstorff luve to
ward keeping pea- and good rela
tions with the Fnit'.d States. His
rivals at home are said to be mak
ing his pathway hard by interposing
objections to such concessions as
the ambassador asks Perlin to make
in the interest of harmony.
"The intrigues of the von Tirpitr
party have been and still are a
danger cloud thre.tter.ing tho chan
cellor," says the correspondent.
