Chicago) III., Feb.15. Search was
started today for the principals In
what is believed by the police to have
beep a plot to destroy buildings and
kill members of the clergy, bankers
and others, in a dozen cities In var
ious sections of the United States.
Discovery of tho alleged plot, accord
ing1 to the police, resulted from ex
amination ot the personal effects ot
John Allegrlnl, confidant of Jean
Crones, who is charged by the au
thorities with putting poison In soup
qt the banquet given Archbishop
George W. Mundelelnn at the Univer
sity Club Thursday night, and caus
ing, the Illness of 100 of the guests.

At first It was believed that tho lll -
ness ot tho banqueters was caused
from ptomaine poison, but discovery
ot the plot, to poison guests at the
Mundelelh dinner has given strength
to the belief that tho Illness ot the
other banqueters may have been due
to a slmtmlar plot.
In connection with the alleged
plans of tho conspirators to destroy
public buildings and church proper
ty, police records show that two
score or more Chicago churches have
suffered losses within the last two
years. At the Moody church it was
said, no less than six fires said to
have been ot incendiary orgin, have
been extinguished with small loss
during thelast year.

dfary fires hare been discovered In

was destroyed September 26 last.

One of tho Interesting develop
ments in the case yesterday was the
finding of a letter in Allegrlni'a
pocket In which reference was made
to a fund colected for the widow of
Gaotano Brescl, who assassinated
King Humbert of Italy. Subsequent
developments have led the police to
believe that Crones and Allegrlnl
may have had, knowledge of the plot
to assassinate the Italian monarch.
That an attempt to blow up the
State penitentiary at Jolfet, II., was
one of the plans of the alleged plot
ters, tho police said today, was Indi
cated by one ot the Allegrlnl let
ters. Recently It became known that
dynamite sufficient to wreck many
bulldlngB had been found secreted In
the-penitenttary.
-The letter, which was not signed,
read:
"There are many good men pen
ned up like dogs In Jollet. What a
wonderful thing It would be if we
could free them. It would be hard.
You know F Is there."
