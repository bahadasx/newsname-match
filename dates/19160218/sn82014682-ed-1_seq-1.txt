In opening this 1 latter report, he
,cays: : .
'" "Conditions after my arrival, and
' vntll recently, may be summarized as
follows:. The organization was large
ly a political one; this was especially
true of -the 2nd Battalion of the regi

drills 'n pre. often than, the rest and

lolitical .nai Ciine, mosVeff icient at the
polls, but Mrh indifferent and ineffi
cient officers at the head, and with
men eeKlcpi seen at the drill hall. "' It
was aifrrjQst impossible to secure the
removal pfv these inefficient officers;

representative, or had some local Ini

the first year. Some of the 'dead tim
ber' was gotten rid of, but with such
- a handicap as a political head and
body. Indifference and inattention to
duty spread as a dry rot through the
entire organization? :
Lieut , Whitener then goes on to
quote from the report of May 12, 1915.
Ir. this he again emphasizes "the
lolitical character of the present or
ganization,! and while' crediting the
Hawalians with making good soldiers,
i-ays that fit, is believed that the Ha
waiian officer In command of a Ha-
vaiian company is a failure, with two
or three-exceptions.- and added that
tbe elimination: of politics from the
guard would result "in as increased
efficiency as can be hoped for." ,
November, Report Refers to Past
This ends his quotation from "the
report of May 12, 1915.-and he con
tinues with a much longer discussion
oi the situation as viewed by him last
November. . v
The past ; Inefficiency ' of the Na

nays, "or to notable and exceptional

An Investment of from $100,000 to

house in Honolulu is. planned by Rob
ert A. Fowler of Los Angeles, a capi
talist who has mad? a fortune in the
California city in the book- business
and by apartment house building.
' That Is what I have in mind In
fact I came, here especially to size up
Honolulu as a field for such an Invest
ment" says Mr. Fowler, who Is stop
ping at the Hale Kal hotel.
"So far Honolulu looks to me very
promising fcr such a venture. I am
going to stay about two months, and
when the big Carnival crowd has de
parted I shall be better able to ar
rive at a definite conclusion."
Mr. Fowler is the! owner of Fowler's
Bookstore, : ch ' South . Broadway, Loe
Angeles. He has built four big apart
ment houses, the Trebor, in the West-
lake park district; the Corola, at Pico
and Hill streets; the Elslnore, at Pico

what he declares is violation of the
law in the feeding of Filipino members
of the National Guard at public ; ex
pense.-';.
This is the latest step in the issue
raised, a few days ago by Attorney
Wilder, when he declared that Filipi

feed them . from . the immigration
board's funds Is both Illegal and' un
necessary. -
The Star-Bulletin asked Judge Ash
ford shortly before noon if he would
bring the letter ; to the attention of
the grand jury today. VI am not able
to say definitely whether I shall or
shall not" the judge, replied. "I am
engaged In a trial which may prevent
my being able to meet, with the grand
jury, and furthermore, I have not had
time to read Mr. Wilder's letter. Be
fore deciding whether or not to pre
sent it I should take time to read it

In his letter Jlr. Wilder repeats,
citing the territorial laws, the charges
of illegality he has already made.
