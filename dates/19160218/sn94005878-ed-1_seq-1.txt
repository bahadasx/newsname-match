I'residi-ut Wil.itm would not ,irreoc
ably" support the Continental army
pluu and because he opposes the ad
ministrations program of Letting a
definite time it- Philippine Inde
pendence.
l'ri-sluetit Wilsou accepted the re'
ignation and has not selected a suc
cessor. The President himself prob
ably will take personal charg of the
administration's national defense
plans in Congress. f
Assistant Secretary l!re keuridg)
also resigned cs a murk of loyulty to
his chief whose views be shared. The
President accepted his resignation.
Both take effect Immediately. Major
Geiieral ltui;h I- Scott, cbli f of staff
ot the army, automatically becomes
secretary of war sd Interim.
The retilgnation came as a distinct
surprise not only to Washington gen
erally, but to members of the Cabinet.
One Cabinet officer said that while he
knew there was a difference of opin
ion hetwein the President and Mr
Garrison over handling the army
plans, he bad not the slightest suspi
clou that an actual break wus impend'
ing. Although Mr. Garrison first sug
gested thut he leave the Cabinet last
mouth, Mr. Wilson did not formally
accept his resignation until late
Thursday afternoon, when Informed
thut Mr. Gurrison had left for New
York nnd that a rumor of his resigna
tion were current. The President then
dictated the letter of acceptance und
dispatched it immediately.
It was not until 8 o'clock Thursday
night that formal announcement of tht
Garrison and llrecken'idge rw'ejna
lions wus at the White House.
It is known that one of SeenMary
Gai.lson's principal reasons for hi
conviction th.it ony a federal rentl
nenlal" Rfiny, minead of n reirganuet
national giuird, could be the main n.il
Itnry dependeiiro of the nation, wai
his belief that some day the I'nitet
States mav be called upon o defcm
the Monroe doctrine, nnd lu thu'
event he foresaw the naiional guarí
might not be available for use oiitsht
of the liiiteil Slates before a declara
tlim of war.
t'pon the contention on th" on(
hand thut the continent.il unity ' ultl
mutely universal service was the na
tiou's only reliance, the position, ot
the othir. that no one plan could hi
enforced upon Congress:, Presiden
Wilson and his secretary of war part
ed official company.
Mr. Carrison's resignation wan t
complete surprise to official Washing
ton generally. Ho made no pe'sona
explanation.
Several hours before the official an
nouncement Ivi had h.iarded a trait
with his wife for New York, nnd wort
had lieen passed ut the depurtmen
that he had gone for au imletlnitt
stay.
The acute differences of opinio!
which led to the break began earlv It
the year when opposition to the con
tinental iirmy pluu befan developinj
in Congress.
The circumstances which led up t(
the resignation are detailed In the sec
retury's correspondence with the Pres
ident, which was made public tor.lglr
by the White House. .
