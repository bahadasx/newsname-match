LONDON, Feb. 18. The Times'
naval correspondent expresses the
belief that the recent increased activ
ity of the German fleet is due to the
appointment of a new commander in
chief whose name has not been di
vulged, and the passing into service
of new vessels.
The Tonopah relief committee Is
not merely devoted to charitable
work within the city limits. Yester
day word came that a family was in
distress at Nyala and a big bunch of
clothing and provisions was imme
diately dispatched on this long 'trip.
There is no need for any worthy per
sons to suffer. All that in neces
sary Is for their cases to be reported
and Investigated, after which imme
diate relief will be given.
