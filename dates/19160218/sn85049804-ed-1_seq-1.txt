BATTLE HYMN OF THE NEGRO.
Davis Writes Thrilling Poem in Mem
ory of Dr. Washington.
The "Battle Hymn of the Negro"
was written by William H. "Davis of
Washington and is dedicated to the
memory of the late Dr. Booker T.
Washington. Mr. Davis is the official
stenographer for the National Negro
Business League, in which position
he has rendered valuable service.
The "Battle Hymn of the Negro" is
to be sung to the tune of Julia Ward
Howe's "Battle Hymn ofthe Repub
lic." The hpmn:
Our eyes have seen the glory of a
Booker Washington.
He has fought a swordless battle for
the cause of right and won.
He has made his race respected,
though his life on earth is done
His truth is marching on!
CHORUS.
Glory,
glory,,
hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
"Our Booker Washington."
We have seen him in the watchiires
of our race's bitter woes
Beating down the flames of prejudice
and making friends of foes. ,,
We have h«ard his forceful pleadings,
and our racial progress, shows
ThS wcrk of Washington.
jgipr
•w' t-.' --r
We have heard his loving gospel urg
ing "Brotherhood of Men,"
"Mutual helpfulness" his doctrine,
preached by action, tongue and
pen.
Whites and blacks should live togeth
er—not as enemies, but friends,
For God is marching on.
He has sounded forth the trumpet
that would never call retreat,
Prove yourselves useful Americans
and never fear defeat.
Oh, be swift our souls to answer,
make the victory complete
Of Booker Washington.
In the hills of "old Virginia' he "was
born.in poverty,
With ambition in his bosom, even "up
from slavery."
As he died to lift men higher, teach
our children then to see
The truths of Washington.
WEAVER FOR THE HOUSE.
The candidacy of James B. Weaver
for the legislature from Polk county
will be received with satisfaction by
everybody who wishes to contribute
something from Polk county to state
leadership in the things that go to
the making of a great state.
Mr. Weaver inherited from his
father a taste for public affairs which
study and travel have not taken away
from him, and he will come to the
legislature with a real zeal for the
cause.
The Evening Tribune does not
know of a man better qualified for
distinguished service in the house,
nor one who will work more untir
ingly.
It is a fortunate thing that such
men are offering themselves to the
people. The most formidable com
plaint against the primary system is
answered by every such candidacy,
and the best guaranty is given of the
effectiveness of popular government.

FARMERS CONFERENCE A SUC-
(Special.)
The annual Missouri and western
states Negro fair and conference
closed a splendid three days' session
Saturday, February 12th—Lincoln's
birthday—at the Bartlett Industrial
school, which originated these yearly
meetings for country life colored peo
ple of these western states.
The conference is growing in favor
ar.d great usefulness to the communi
ties where these colored people live,
as well as to the states at large.

talks.
The feature of this conference was
a great address mqfde by Hon. Fred
D. Gardner of St. Louis, Mo., who is
author of the Gardner land bank
credit movement, which is sweeping
the entire state, and seems to be
truly the greatest blessing that ever
came in sight of and for the Missouri
farmers. This speech and the man
behind it carried representat've and
thoughtful colored men from all over
the state as no democrat has ever
carried them. They expressed them
selves as Gardner men, come what
may.
Those who won blue ribbon premi
ums for their exhibits were: The
Bartlett Agricultural and Industrial
School for largest and best white corn
exhibit and for 100 per cent germin
ated and growing corn—Boone Coun
ty White also first prizes in cooking,

Principal N. C. Bruce kept the
farmers to practical subjects of fewer
acres, better cultivation, purer seed,
stock. Especial emphasis was laid on
better home influences, cleaner prem
ises and mora intelligent care of
good quiet bshavior of children and
less aping, and straining after dress
and setyle, more heed to the thorough
training of colored girls and boys to
useful work in the kitchens and on
the farms.
