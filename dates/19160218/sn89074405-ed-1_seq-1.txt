GERMANY'S ORDER
DISCUSSED TODAY
Must Make Teutons Realize
the Indisputable Rights of
America, They Say.
.-. Washington, Feb. 18.—Senator
Tjodge, ranking minority member
of the foreign relations commit
tee, made a sjieeeh In the senate
declaring that the abandonment
by the United States at this time
of the principle that its ports
were open and Its citizens free to
travel upon merchantmen of bel
ligerent nations armed solely for
defensive purposes would be an
'unneutral act and a step toward
war. He said It would make the
United States an ally of belliger
ent* whose merchant marine had
been swept from the seas.
RECOGNIZE RIGHTS.
The senator spoke at length,
dwelling upon the history of in
ternational law relating to the
arming of merchantmen for de
fense and citing precedents In the
record of the United States. He
referred to reports that the ad
ministration

the issuancetM German
Austrian memoranda announcing

said,- this government recognized
"that American citizens were with
In their Indisputable rights In tak
ing their ships and In traveling
wherever their legitimate bus!
lioss culls ilium upon the high
seas."
PRACTICE OF AIjIJ NATIONS.
"Such." he added, "has been
the practice of all nations in re
gard to tlie armed merchantmen.
It seems utterly lncredltable that
this position should be In any way
altered 'now or that our govern
ment should be ready to surren
der the questions of rights of
Americans to travel or ship goods
on a belligerent merchantman
.subject to nil the rules which
liave lx
*n established by the
courts and by all international
authorities for at least two cen
turies."
"GRAVEST CRISIS."
Senator Sterling of South Da
kota spoke on his resolution to
declare the senate's concern at
the recent German naval order to
sink all armed allied merchant
ships. Ho said the Issue brought
the United States to Its "gravest
international crisis."
"Instead of yielding to the
claims of tlie German admiralty,"
said Sterling, "their very men
tion should meet with vigorous
protest."

Generally, the delegates who ad

PROTEST TO
STAJEBOARD
Objects to Divided Authori
ty at State Agricultural
College.
President J. H. Worst of the state
agricultural college appeared- 'before
the board of regents of the state edu
cational institutions at Bismarck thla
morning and reiterated his position
that the institution of which he is
president should have one head, in
stead of two, according to word re
ceived here.
According to a statement published
In the Fargo Courier-News this morn
ing, the president's protest to the
board was due to the situation creat
ed at the college by the former board
of trustees which makes Thomas
Cooper, head of the extension depart
ment of the school, and in charge of
the state agricultural experiment sta
tion. independent of the authority of
the president.
Twlchell Rumor Denied.
The Bismarck dispatch states that
the matter of the election of Tread
well Twichell to the presidency of the
college, which has been persistently
r„mored, has never been considered
or even put up to the board in any
manner.
Members of the board claim there
is absolutely no foundation to the ru
mor, and those near to the board
claim that the appointment of Twich
ell is neither possible nor probable.
Worst Makes Statement.
Before leaving Fargo Thursday
evening to attend the meeting of th'ejlv
appearing before the board to ask that
new board of regents has never ex-
pressed Its policy in regard to the
matter and with this fact in mind, he
simply asks for its attitude. When
questioned if he would resign if the
board rejected his' suggestion, he de
clared in the negative, but asserted
that he had the charter of the institu
tion, laws of the state and the federal
government with him, adding that the
federal government provides that the
president of every state agricultural
college shall be the chief executive of
the institution and that the other offi
cials shall be subordinates.
President Worst was asked if his
trip to Bismarck had anything to do
with the rumors current of late that
a general shakeup was expected at the
state agricultural college. He stated
that he had heard rumors to this ef
fect, but his mission was not to that
end. For several weeks it has been re
ported that the state board of regents
has been directing considerable at
tention to the affairs of the college in
an. effort to effect a complete
ganization through which it has been
intimated that the president would be
asked to resign besides most of the
department heads and professors.
board President Worst said: "I am
leaving Fargo inclined to be peaceable, It IS assumed tllat large num
but I am also inclined to prepared-i
ness," thus defining his position when'
the administrative policy of the school ...
be restored to what it was two years
ago, before the old board of trustees
appointed Thomas A. Cooper head of
the extension department and experi
ment station, giving him authority
equal to that of the president, and
thus creating a situation of divided
leadership which is alleged to be
harmful to the best interests of the
college, according to the Courier
News.
Will Not Resign.

Petrograd, Feb. 18.—The
fall of Erzerum, the most im
portant Turkish stronghold
in Asia Minor, for a long
time considered impregna
ble, offers an unprecedented
spectacle of the first class
fortress built on the steep
mountani ridge nearly a Tjiile
above the sea level yielding
to bayonet attack after 36
hours of bombardment.
Operations were conduct
ed under the most severe
weather conditions, the snow
being deep and the thermom
eter registering at times
more than 30 degrees below

The Turkish army was
taken by surprise under the
methods adopted by the Rus
