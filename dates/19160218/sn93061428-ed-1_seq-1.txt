BAD AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT
Joe Cunningham, Billy Hughes and
Will McBryde narrowly escaped- with
their lives last Saturday nighc about
twelve o'clock by striking a wagon
driven by Candelario Cano in front
of the Kernodle residence on Canal
avenut. Joe was drifig his new
Franklin, one of the finest cars in
Carlsbad, and was traveling about the
middle of the street He says he ran
into the wagon before he saw it,
though hia lights were working well.
Both the wagon and car wire going
north, both being in the middle of
the road, the car coming up behind.
When the car struck the wagon it
turned a cat over the wagon and
killed a mule but from some unac
countable cause the Mexican, Cano
or his son, who were in the wagon,
were mu injured senuusiy. nncn joe i
pulled himself out from under the
steering wheel he found that Will Mo
Bryde had a very had shoulder, dis
located from the car crushing him.
but Joe was oplv slightly bruised
It seems when the car struck . it
throwed the Mexicans, Cano and son
who was with him, so high that
lit outside the wagon on the grou

no worse and paid for the mule and
all damage, which will probably oe
near 11.000 to the car and Mexican
outfit, he having settled with the Mex-
lean for $176.00. Mr. McBryde Is at
the Anderson Sanatarium, where he
will make headquarters until he re-
covers from his injuries, though he
is able to be out on the streets at pre-
stnt.
