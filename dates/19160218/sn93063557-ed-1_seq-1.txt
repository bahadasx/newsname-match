mittee composed of I3ruce, Ferguson

jrganizp drills and arrange other do
tails. A committee of Adams, Danolds

the advertising department of the
boards qn the various college publica
tions so that the business men of tho

times during the year in regard to ad
vertising. Several plans wero discussed
for raising money for tho coming base
ball seaaon, among them a masquerade
dance, a vaudeville, a gym exhibit, an
entertainment by the college quartet
and mandolin club, a baaket ball game
between U. V. M. freshmen and Midd.
freshmen, and a special movie at the
opera house. Some of these plana will
bo carried out in the near future. It
was voted to have a committee of the
three varsity managers and four othera
tend to getting up a vaudeville show to

FIRE IN CORNWALL.
Fire on Saturday morning would have
destroyed tho old homestead of Peter
Tulley in Cornwall had it not been for
the timely assistnnce of neighbors who
were summoncd by telephone. Tho
cause of the fire was the burning out of
a chininey which set fire to planks
which encnsed it. The planks had to be
cut away and also part of the attic floor
so that the fire could bo reached and
then by the use of plenty of water the
firc was extinguished. The house was
occupied by Andrew and George Tulley
and their sister, Miss Elizabeth Tulley.
The loss is covered by insurance.

KEI'OItT OF THE UDUAKIAN.
Tho circulation of books and maga-
zines for the year ending January 31,
1910, has been 23,970. Of thc circula
tion of books, 00 per cent waa fictirn,
13 per cent non-fiction and 27 per cent
juvenile, of which one-fourth was not
stories. The average dnily circulation
has been 79.
The number of now patrons has been
233, making a total of 2144 since 1911.
Tho reading tablo has been supplied
with fourteen monthly magazinea and
fivc wcekly papers, three of which were
gifts.
The number of books added aince
February 1, 1915, is 259. Of this num
ber 45 were gifts and 10 were the vol
urnea of magazinea bound.
The number of books mended during
tho year is 895, rebound 48. The last
accession number is 9040.
Some of the teachers have availed
themselvea of the privilege of taking
aa many books as desired for the use of
pupils and teachers.
This is the fiftieth anniversary of
the founding of the library and it
seems an appropriate time for some
body to do something to benefit the
boya and girla of Middlebury bv in-
creasing the usefulnesa of the librnry.
The most euectual way to do this is to
provide a building where one room can
be devoted to the children and another
can be used for reading. Our reading
table is so well patronized that twice
this winter the librarian has been
obliged to say to boys, "There is no
room for you."
Susan E. Akciiibald,
Librarian.
