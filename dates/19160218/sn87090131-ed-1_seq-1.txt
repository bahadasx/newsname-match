DOLLARS AND SENSE. EDUCATION FOR tEVELOPMENT.
DOLLARS AND SENSE. ED
Dollars count. Without them we I
cannot procure food to eat, clothes to grr
wear or a roof to shelter us. ing
Dollars by themselves, however, are is
worth mighty little, even in the mart the
of trade; for mere money, unaccom- ly,
panied by a distributing agent, is as is
valueless as would be a work of art an'
covered with burlap and stored in a wh
cellar. for
Men of mark, taking them as they dir
run, and barring the few who are only cal
financially successful, have something lac
besides money, have done something I
which money cannot do. They owe to
their reputations in business, and out wh
of it, not wholly to the fact that they an
are financially rich or commercially
influential. pr1
Dollars without sense are as badly ed
off as would be sense without dollars th4
to provide for its wants. the
The power of money, great as it Is, wI
is not vested wholly in money itself we
Its value is dependent upon what aso- pe
companies it . . cal
The miser, even though his store- asi
house is filled with ready cash, has no mi
standing in the community and is not qu
I on good terms even with himself. He tel
has accumulated, but he has not dis- te<
tributed. He has made money and ha
done nothing else. in
Good sense, common sense, is wortn w
more than money, even assuming that trl
money can be obtained without it he
The man of sense stands higher ev
erywhere than does the -an of dol- Ou
lars. ri(
Common sense is to be prized above st
all financial riches. With it all things inj
are possible. ithout it nothing of
worth while can be accomplished.
Men today are reckoned by their to
sense, not by their dollars. Their Pr
positions in business, in the profes- t
sions, in the community, are depend
ent upon the amount of common sense w
they possess, with or without accom- ic
panying money. n
Don't imagine, young man, that the ce
mere accumulation of money is going hi
to give you any position of which you if
may be proud, even among men of er
money.
When men die they leave only one
heritage which is remembered, and of
that is what they have done for the
benefit of humanity, whether or not
this good has been accomplished by
willing money to schools, libraries, f
and charities, or is obtained because w
they left behind them an example al
worthy to be followed. m
Remember that a draft drawn on I
the Bank -of Earth is not payable at bi
the Bank of Heaven. tr
If you would have your money do 01
you and others any good, mix sense
with It.
If you wopld have your business of ai
benefit to you and to your community,
or to those who labor .under you, use al
sense in conducting it. 01
Sense has a value in every market- w
Dollars are not good everywhere. y
Sense and gumption are marketable tl
commodities. Without them the rich- bh
est money man' is poor indeed. 8
Money is worth having. Without it a
we cannot eat or live; but lonesome 01
money is barren as a desert plain. W
By itself alone it cannot sow or har
vest. It is a drag which prevents the tl
rudder of the Ship of Life from mak- I1
inf a straight course. et
A diet of dollars results in mental
starvation. Sense is the food which
nourishes both the mind and the body.
Get sense first, and money after
ward.
Animals at Play.
"That the lower animals do not
laugh, that they have no sense of u
humor, is hard to understand when we c
think how thoroughly they love to t
play. From the highest to the hum- i,
blest, they show the keenest joy in 1i
sport, but they cannot laugh! If they is
could, perhaps the power would bring o
with it other mental gifts, such as *
to upset the whole order of things. Be
that as it may, the watcher of wild c
life never kets used to the sight of h
their mirthless sport, for in all other e
respects their play is entirely hu
man. 1
"A great deal of human play is se
- rious-desperately serious on the foot
ball field and at the card table, espe
cially when a lonely player at soli- ii
taire, for instance, is trying to 'kill
time.'
"I have watched a great, ungainly
hippopotamus trying by the hour to
do the same solemn thing: cuffing a ,
croquet ball back and forth from one t
end of his cage to the other. His
keepers said that without the play
thing the poor caged giant would fret t
and worry himself to death. It was
his game of solitaire."-Dallas Lore
Sharp in St. Nicholas.
Farmers Use Phone. t
A farm report shows that one
fourth of the telephones operated by
a leading company are located in farm
houses. The spriad of the telephone z
in the last five years has been surpris
ingly swift, but hardly outstrips the
use of electrical appliances in the t
home, in the factory, on the farm-ln t
fact, in nearly every phase of lifa 1
Education may be divided into three
grand divisions: First, a school train
ing in the so-called three R's. This
is fundamental, and, without it, fur
ther. education is impossible. Second
ly, broad or liberal education, such as
is given in our high schools, colleges,
and other institutions of learning,
which do not specifically prepare one
for his vocation. Thirdly, education
directly bearing upon one's selected
calling, like that given by the medical,
law, and technical schools.
In this article I shall confine myself
to the second class, that of education
which stands between fundamental
and vocational training.
Authorities are divided. Some over
practical men claim that this cultural
education is not necessary, and that
the boy should jump immediately from
the fundamentals into a training -
which would directly assist him in the
work of his life; other educational ex
perts strongly advocate a liberal edu
cation, like that given in our colleges,
asserting that it will broaden the
mind and fit it better to grasp the re
quirements of the future. These lat
ter authorities do not object to the
technical training, but they would
have the young man ground himself
in general culture, if I may put it that
way, before he obtains a vocational
training, or during the time in which
he is obtaining it.
Many of the colleges are following
out this idea, and adapting their cur
ricula to it, allowing the student to
study general subjects while he is tak
ing up one or more directly in the line
of his future work.
It has been said that one cannot be
too broadly educated. This is true.
provided this education can be ob
tained without too great a sacrifice.
If a boy is going to enter a business
where he cannot directly use the class
Ice or other cultural subjects, and can
not obtain a knowledge of them ex
cept at enormous sacrifice, I advise
him to forego a college education; but,
if he is in a position to become lib
erally educated, irrespective of his
coming calling, I suggest for him a
university course, or any other form
of broad education, which will un
doubtedly better fit his mind to absorb
the technique of his trade.
If, however, one is to enter a pro
fession, this general broad education
will be found of direct value to him,
although he may not use all of it. His
minA then becomes his working tools,
and it should be trained along the
broadest and most liberal lines, a
training which is not as necessary if
one is to enter business.
It is the man, more than the educa
tion. The education at best can only
assist him in his development.
In summing up, I would say: Get
all the education you can, cultural and
otherwise, provided you can do so
without injury to your health or to
your prospects. If you are so situated
that you cannot well afford the time,
because it is necessary for you to be
self-supporting at an early age, I
would suggest that you forego much
of this education, which otherwise I
would advise you to obtain.
When in doubt, get more education
than you think you need, rather than
less. It is simply a question of wheth
er you can afford to pay the price.
MAKING HOUSEWORK EASIER
Modern Devices That Have Found a
Place in Most of the Homes of
the Country.
The sale of household and kitchen
utensils is subject to all sorts of
chances and changes from the fluctua
tions in public taste and the march of
improvement. Wood bowls and mino
1 ing knives were once staples, but the
invention of food choppers has serl
ously diminished their usefulness.
The growing popularity of aluminum
utensils has had some setback be
cause housekeepers find the metal
harder to keep clean and bright than
Senamel ware.
The old-fashioned castiron pots, skil
lets and frying pans are out of date
save in remote country districts, and
have given place to wrought-steel
utensils, much lighter and more last
ing. Every modern kitchen has like
Swise up-to-date small conveniences.
such as mechanical lighters in place
Sof matches, asbestos mats to keep
Sthings hot, soap containers for dish
a washing, cool handled stove lifters, and
Sthe like. One of the great changes
Sthat has come in the household is the
vacuum cleaner, taking the place of
Sthe broom, the carpet sweeper and
Sthe carpet beater, and saving all this
Shard hand labor, since the best and
most efficient cleaner is electrically
run and needs only to be attached to
the electric lighting plug.
