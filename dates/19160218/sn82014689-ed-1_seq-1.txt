NUMBER 52
Board Reimburses McKay
For Fees Paid Twice
At Its last meeting, the board of
supervisors voted the sura of $44 to
reimburse Judge W. A. McKay for
fees collected by him on process pa
pers served, which he turned over to
the county treasurer, and which he re
cently had to pay over again to police
men who claimed these foes.
The case was one of those brought
through Attorney Eugene Murphy
against the district magistrate, and
which he won in the local courts. It
is claimed that there is a conflict in
the statutes as to the disposition to be
made of the fees for serving papers.
It has been the custom to turn them
as county realization, here on Maui,
but under another law, It would seem
that the police are entitled to them.
This is claimed to he the course taken
in Honolulu. The matter may be car
ried to the supreme court for decis
ion. Board May Soon Pass
Sunday Movies Bill
The matter of Sunday movies
will again be considered by the
supervisors at their March meeting,
and it is possible that this time the
privilege will be granted. A peti
tion of 145 names of Lahaina citi
zens was received at last week's
meeting. Some of the members
who previously voted against the
proposition, have stated that they
will not oppose it, if convinced that
the people demand the Sunday
shows.
COUNTY TO IMPROVE ARMORY.
The sum of $950 was appropriat
ed by the supervisors, at their meet
ing last week, for alterations to be
made to the Wailuku armory
These will include a messanine
floor above a portion of the main
floor of the building, upon which
lockers and storage space will be
provided. The work is to be done
by the Wailuku Sugar Company.
AUTO LIGHTS MUST BE DIMMED.
Without specifying how the ob
ject is tobeaccomplished, the board
of supervisors passed a light-dimm
ing amendment to the automobile
ordinance at itsl ast wesk meeting.
After the fijst of March any head
lights not provided with means for
eliminating the objectionable glare,
will be cause for arrest and fine.
- o
GRADE LINES TO BE FIXED.
Permanent street lines and grades
are to be established in the towns of
Wailuku and Lahaina, as soon as
the surveys can be made, and after
this is done no new buildings will
be permitted which do not conform
to these lines. This was decided
upon by the board of supervisors at
its meeting last meeting last week,
when the county engineer was
authorized to employ au assistant
engineer in order that the work
may be put through promptly.

Tlans for the annual Fourth of July
race meeting took definite shape last
Tuesday evening, when, at a well at
tended meeting of the Maui Racing

ecution. Messrs. McPhee and Locey
are required to frame the program for
the days events in conjunction with

no opposition to the plan to entrust
to McPhee and Locey the management
