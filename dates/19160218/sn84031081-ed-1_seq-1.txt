merchant shipping,
A score of members attacked th''
government's method of dealing with
merchant marine. Arthur J, Balfour,
first lord of the ilmiralty, and Walter
Hunciinan. president of the board of
trade, replied to the attacks, explain
ing in much the same manner as was
used yesterday in connection with the
air defense criticisms that while the
situation was admitted to be far from
satisfactory, the goveynent. was doing
ils utmost to make things bettor.
The complaints of the members of
Parliament were mainly to the effect
that tho high freight rates were, large
ly duo to waste ot tonnage caused by
governmoid mismanagement. Mr.
Kuneininii In reply said:
The shipping difficulties of the
I present time arc due not to misman
agement but to our trying to pour u
quart into a pint pot. This and noth
ing else. The general upward ton
d'eiioy of ocan freights is caused by
the fact that the mercantile murine,
which Is limited in size, has to carry
out a task far greater than In time of
peace. The shipping problem has be-
