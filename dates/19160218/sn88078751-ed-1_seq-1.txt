Stronghold
After Fierce
British And Germans Fighting For
The Trenches Near Ypres
London. Feb. 17. Erzerum, tlio
great Armenian fortress, where the
main Turkish Caucasus army, esti
mated at 1CO.000 men, has been bo
sieged, has fallen into the hands ol
tho Hussions. The Turkish army is
fleeing westward.
This was officially announced by
tho Russian war office. Grand Duke
Nicholas, commander of tho Russian
forces, telegraphed to tho emperor as
follows: "God has granted to the
brave tioops of tho army of the Cau
casus sucn great power that Erzerum
has been taken after Ave days of un
precedented assaults."
The c.ipture of Erzerum is consid
ered of great strategic importance.
From it tudiate roods leading in all
directions. Over those to the south
cast and south, it will be possible for
the Russians to fight their way to
ward their compatriots operating
against the Persians and Turks in
northwest and west Persia, or pro
ceed south toward Bagdad, to tho re
lief of the British bottled up in Kut-el-Amara,
on tho Tigris, southeast of
Bagdad. Tho immediate effect of the
Russian victory on tho situation in
Persia and Mesopotamia is problemat
leal, however, for, despite the roads,
tho country is mountainous ord theie
la still much ground to be covered.

THE DECREE
OFJERLIN
Is Taken Up By Secretary
Lansing
Reopens !!:e Whole Question of
Submarine Warfare.
WRITTEN DISCLAIMER SOUGH!
Secretary of State Would Have Ger
many Make Declaration Tnat Msr
chantmen Armed Tor Defense Will
Not Be Attacked Without Warning.
New Development Interrupts Settle
ment of the Lusitanla Controversy.
Washington, Feb. 17. German) 's
declared Intention of attacking armed
enemy merchantmen without warning:
after March 1 has Interrupted a set
tlement of tho Lusitania controversj.
Moro than that, it has reopened the
whole question of submarine warfare.
The German government. If it is to.
give the United StatPs tho satisfac
tion it demands, must practically re
voke Its recently .proclaimed decree
that armed enemy merchant ships
are. In fact, to be regarded as auxil
iary ships of war.
Before accepting the satisfaction
which Germany has agreed to glvo
for a settlement of the Lusitania con
troversy tho United States, It was au
thoritatively stated at the state de
partment, Drobably will insist on hav
ing a written statement from Berlin
that Cermnny in Its new submarine,
campaign will not attack without
warning enemy merchant ships armed
for defense.
Whether Germany is to accept this
new dictum is a matter of doubt. In
any event, the prediction was made In
German embassy quarters that pro
longed correspondence betwean tho
two governments Is bound to ensue.
In the meantime, however, there Is a.
possibility that Germany may post
pone the operation of her new sub
marine warfare. This the ambassa
dor himself suggested In his confer
ence with Secretary Lansing.
But for this new development. It
was stated both at the department
and at the embassy, the latest com
rounlcation from Germany In the Lusi
tania dlspr.te would probably have'
brought about an immediate settle
ment When Count Von Bernstorfr
called at the state department he had
with him a memorandum from Berlin
containing a draft of the proposed
Lusitania agreement. This draft, it
U authoritatively stated embodied all
the changes In phraseology which Mr
Lansing had asked for. Instead or
"assuming" liability for reparation la
the case of the Americans who werer
killed. Germany, in this new memor
andum expressed a willingness to
''recognire" such liability.
