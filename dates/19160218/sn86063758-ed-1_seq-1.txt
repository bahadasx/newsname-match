(By Jno K. Aull.)
^P^cial to The Herald and News.
Columbia, Feb. 16.?-The finance
committee of tne senate reported the
' ? a..
general appropriation bill to tnai uouv
on 'Wednesday, and both houses are
aiow hard at work trying to get
tkrough the work of the session in order
to adjourn Saturday night or Sunday
morning. Of course, final adjournment
may not be reached until next
week, but most of the members are
Anxious to wind up the session and
get home.
Elected Judge and Declines.
Mr. George Warren, member of the
house from Hampton, was elected on
1-1 ? > 4 + Vi
Tuesday, judge 01 ine new n,.u JUv^
1 ial circuit over his protest, and on
Tuesday night he send a comunication
to the general assembly thanking
the legislature for the honor, but
slating that his duty to 'his family
would not permit him to make the
financial sacrifice. Mr. Warren is one
af the younger members of the house,
and he evidenlv thought that the salary
of a circuit judge did not nold
much attraction.
Kt noon the house and senate met
i? joint assembly for the purpose of
electing a judge cf the Fourteenth judicial
circuit. which ' includes the
counties of Hamj'ioi:, Coileton, Beau:'.>n
ami Jasper.

senator rau^u
Jx Peurifoy of Walterboro; Mr. Dantzler
nominated George Warren of
Hampton; Mr. Moore nominated W.
B. Gruber of Walterboro.
Mr. Warren tried earnestly to
* withdraw his name as a nominee and
mads a short speech in favor of Mr.
Peiurifoy.
The result of the first ballot was
Warren 67, Peurifoy 49, Gruber 30,
(W. R. Hubbard 1.
While the balloting was in progress
Mr. Warren withdrew from the hall
t.hp house, returning in time to
<vote for Mr. Peurifoy. A number of
"nis friends surrounded him. urging
him to stay in 'the race and not to
withdraw his name, as he had twice
attempted before balloting was ordered.
While the first ballot was being
iabulated he was again urged to refrain
from withdrawing his name. He
spoke informally of his embarrassing
position, inasmuch as he had been the
godfather of the bill creating the new
circuit.
Mr. Warren made a statement in
which he spoke of his gratification and
i surprise at being nominated. He i
that he from the nrst uau suypui tcu
Mr. Gruber. who has since indorsed
Mir. Peurifoy. He pointed out <
that the members of the bar had endorsed
Mr. Peurifoy. He said, too,
that to take the judgeship would be
at a financial loss to himself. He
i thanked the general assembly for its
support, but made it evident that ne
did not want the proffered position.
He pointed out that at the time of the
passage of the bill he had said that Jbe
sought no office; he said toat he still
did not want the position. He was
r
courteous and insistent in his request
to "have Mr. Peurifoy elected and main
- * !
tained that his own eiecuim wuuiu uc
misunderstood. He was applauded on
taking his seat. j
Xo election resulting from the flfst i
ballot, the joint assembly proceeded I
to a second ballot, which resulted asj
follows: Warren SI, Peurifoy 46, Gruber

and the amount of beer to 60 pints per

score the amount to one gallon and
I opposing amendments to reduce the

,The senate drove another nail into
the prohibition structure by passing a
bill making it unlawful for a person
J to act as the go-between in securing
| whiskey. The bill prohibits any ppr
j son in tnis State, witn or wunoui

Nickels' Amendment.
The senate on Tuesday refused to
! give second reading to Senator Nick'
els's proposed constitutional amend
ment prohibiting members of the genI
eral assembly from being candidates
for offices filled by the legislature,
j The proposal failed of receiving the
| necessary two-thirds majority and was
! lost by a vote of 20 to 17.
j The senator from Newberry voted
! against the amendment,
i IMcCormick County.
Both bouse and senate have passed
; the bill by Mr. Robinson to create Mc!
Cormick county with an amendment
| tnat the act shall not go into effect
! until after the supreme court has faj
vorably decided on the case now be;

:
Mr. Robinson pointed out the inconvenience
of reaching either Abbeville,
Greenwood or Edgefield from the
neigrborhood of the town of McCormick.
He said that the proposed
c.oiiiKv came within the prowsions of
I the constitution in area, population
1 and amount of taxable property. He
1 pointed out that there has been a fight
' for the county for 20 years, during
i which time there have been three eleci
: tions. all favorable to the formation
, of the new county.
Senator MeLaurin Endorsed.

duced the following resolution in the
i house of representatives:
I
I "Whereas, In the development of
i the State warehouse system, the Hon.
John L. McLaurin, State warehouse
j commissioner, has revealed the won-j
i derful possibiliries which have lain
i dormant in the fie'd of agriculture,
the result of his efforts in South Carolina
inuring to the benefit not only
of rhp npnnlp of thic State, but of the
: entire South; and,
"Whereas. The need for a national
warehouse system, patterned after the.
system of this State, has been stressed
by Democratic leaders in congress,
and it is apparent that an extension
of the system, under the control of
the States, but with the assistance of
the National government, would materially
aid agricultural development
and the conservation of agricultural
resources throughout the nation: and,
"Whereas, There seems to be a
I
strong possibility that the secretary i
i
cf agriculture in tne presidents cab- j
::iet may be promoted to the portfolio!
of war; therefore, be it
"Resolved, That in the event of a
vacancy in rhe position of secretary
of agriculture in the president's cab-S
ir.et, the Hon. Jno. L. McLaurin, State
warehouse commissioner of South
Carolina, is commended to President j
Wilson by this house as a man whose |
ability as shown by his groat work in ;
South Carolina, and whose construc-!
tive genius coupled with his devotion
to the cause of agriculture, eminently
. i
qualify him for this important post in |
this time of wor'dlwide upheaval." j
$108 000 Added 1?t Senate Committee, j
Chairman Christensen. of the sen-J
ate finance committee last night re- i
ported rhe appropriation bill. The j
committee has worked industriously j
nd carefully on this bill for several I
days. i
Raise Levy One-fourth Jfill.
The senate will advise a levy of six
and one-quarter mills for general
Si ate purposes and one-half of one
mill for the*improvement of >he State
Hospital for tne Insane, il his will
mean a total levy of six and three-'
quarters mills, against a seven-mill,
levy last year. The senate bill shows
a total of $2,.")14,652.22. This is an increase
over the house bill of $106 000.,
The most important and influencing
i= tVint thp senate raised the
[ : j:v.i tucv
amount to be expended on the ^eyli:m
$50,000.
Increase for Asylum.
In a word, the senate committee felt
that tne State was committed to a
po'icy of improvement at the asylum
and it did not wish to go backward in
that direction at this time. In addition
to this increase for the asylum
there was an addition made for the
State Industrial School at Florence of
Si 4.000. These two items are the larg
j. .t1
est increases in the senate report, uait:
senate leaves the appropriation bill
practically as it came from the house
except tbat it adds these Items:
These Additions.
{Expenses for the new circuit, $5,425;
repairs State house roof, $2,000;
increase for tuberculosis camp, $5000;
increase for Winthrop college,
$3,000; University of South Carolina,
$3,000; Medical college, Charleston,
$4 000; State board of charities and
corrections, $2,500; miscellaneous,
mostly claims, $11,000.
. a ?1.\?. &C AAA
?Miwry ^1.^^111111 u^u vv^wvf
The senate committee recommends a
salary of $6,000 for the superintendent
of the State Hospital for the Insane.
The house placed this salary at
$5 000. The senate committee recommends
$125,000 to be expended on consolidated
graded schools. This is a
substantial increase for this item.
The finance committee feels that^'it
has kept the appropriations just as
low as is possible, and that the only
substantial increase over the housQ
bill is in the continuation of the policy
with reierence lo me nuapnai ?ui

Rural ( redits Bead for Present
In spite of earnest efforts from Senator
Sherard to get his rural credits
bill through, the senate adopted an!
amendment. proposed by Senator D.
Reece Williams, providing for a commission
to be created to study the
question cf rural credits and to report
their findings to the general assem-j
bly in 1917. Tnis means that there will j
be no rural cretins lesisiauuu at mis
session, a majority of the senate j
thinking that it would be better to
get all the information possible before
enacting this legislation. Senators
Sherard and Banks thought that the
J rural credits legislation ought to be
j enacted immediately.
The senator from Newberry voted
( aeofnet t'na amendment.
j u^amot V^AV
Torrcns System Passed.

system of land registration passed

I was reading the other day an article
in some magazine written by
Andrew Carnegie on "The Principle

j to those who are willing to help themj
selves, and. generally speaking, that
j is a very correct rule to follow. It
1 is 1 it tie use to keep giving to a feli
low who is too lazv and trifling to try
. | to help himself. Among other things
! that he enumerates as being the right
j direction to place money is in the
'; building of parks. My. purpose in re,:
ferring to this article is to quote what
; | he says about parks and the giving |
to them. Here it is:
. I ?o? !
. | "Public parks are in the very front

| lN9autify and preserve them inviolate.
jis there a more useful or beautiful
: ir.onument thai could be left by any
; man than a park for the city in which
i j he was born or in which he has long
j lived? Or how could the community
pay a more graceful tribute to the
>;citizcn who presents it than to give
?! his name to such a gift?"
i ?o?
! 'That is very true, and if I had the
5; money I would long ago have built and
| given to this city that park of which
j I ha> e been writting lo, these many
i1 moons. I suggested a long time ago
j that there was a family in Newberry
j that owned a beautiful place that
3 i would make an ideal park, and that
-1 they could erect no more beamiful trii
bute to their forebear than to give
a sufficient portion of this property
; to the city for a park, and it is true
i also that the city and county has hon-1
ored many of the members of this fam
ilv with high honor, and it would be
1 not only a fitting tribute to their fore
bear to erect such a monument to his
> memory, but it would in some measure
be an act of appreciation for the
' many honors bestowed upon them. But
- I suppose they take a different view
of the matter, and will not act upon
my suggestion. But I am sure that
while I have no money with which to
hm'M a nark that some day Newberry
I j will recognize the hard work that I
i have done to get a park here, and that
L there will be somewhere along the
shady sides of Scott's creek a beau
tiful park in which the children will
; gambol and where the young folk will
1 tell again the old, old story, and where
' the old folk may spend an hour of
? rest, and the name of the park will be
' The Idler's Park. Not for the money
that I have put in it, but for the long
and faitnful work I have done to
arouse the people to build it, and it
will be built by the people, and not
by any one or two individuals. It will
be a tribute from the people of the
' community to the unselfish service of
1 i one of their obscure and humble citj
izens. And no better monument could

now I have been writing for this co;'
limn, and nor many times have I written
that I did not hav^ something to
say about a park for Newberry. I

have thought that I have said some
things that were not so pleasant. Be
that as it may, I had but one purpose
and that purpose was to get the people
aroused to the necessity of buildI
ing a park. It will come. There
never has been any doubt in my mind
about that. The only thing is I wanted
it to ccme while I might be here
to enjoy at least an occasional evening
beneath its shady bowers and
along side the babbling brook that
flowed .right through the center
thereof.
?o?
And this reminds me to ask if you
hr.ve e'er read that beautiful little
poem called "Two Kinds of People?''!
Well if j'ou bave not you should do
so right now, and here it is.
Two Kinds of People.
Tnere are two kinds of people on
earth today;
? 11 - ???
Just two kinds of people, no more X
ay.
Not tne saint and the sinner, for 'tis
well understood
The good are iialf bad, and the bad
me lialf good;
Not the ricb and the poor, for the
count of man's wealth .
Ymi must first know tfte state of his
conscience and health;
Xot. the h'imbie and proud, for in
life's little span
Who puts on vain jiirs is not counted
a man;
Nol the happy and the sad, for the
swift-flying years
Bring each man his laughter and each.
mannis tears.
No! the two kinds of people on earth
' that I mean
Are the people who lift and the people
who lean.
Where'er you go you will find the
world's masses
Are always divided into just these two
classes;
And, Oddly enough, you find, too, I
mean,
There is only one lifter to twenty '/ho
lean.
Tn which class are you? Are -yon
easing the load
Of overtaxed lifters who toil down
the road?
Or, are you a leaner, who lets others
bear
care?
?o?
And that reminds me to remark further
that I belong to that class where
"There is only one lifter to twenty
who lean
j I am and have always been a lifiter
1 and expect to continue in that role to
i the end. I want you to come along
| and join my band and let us all lift
| together and the lifting will be.
I much the easier for me and for you.
i And you can never realize and appre
I eiate tne good mat win come 10 you
by being a member of the lifter band
until you really do -some lifting. Torn
know that you can't pull yourself very
high by lifting at your own boot
straps, but if you take hold of tht'
! ot'ner fellow's boot straps you may to*
j able to lift him ever so high. Really,
j there is no telling how much we might
i lift th's town :f we wou'd all take holA
of each other's boot 6traps, and not
. be polling so hard ot our own. I
'neard there were those in the com,
munity who are now very much inter,
ested in the laymen's movement, and
1 that this county of Newberry is to &e
I organized and a great big m.-eting is"
to be ireld at Xewberry sometime soon,
j and great big speeches are-to be made.
,1 hat's all r<*fcr ip a way. I believe is
these meetings an<3 in getting up the *
i i
| enthusiasm, but I like to see so&e or
t'ne enthusiasm spent in the way of
helping the Other fellow, not only bj
wise counsel, but by that which takes
hold of his boot straps and helps to
lift hi mup ojc oT the mire. And
helps him to stand alone and to walk.
Talk and conventions won't accomplish
this by themselves. It is all
right to have them but they must be (
followed up by that class wmcn -Delongs
to the lifters.
By George, I see that the house has
passed the bill allowing them there
60 pints of beer a month, but it is not
to have but five per cent, of alcohol.
i
I really have been much amused at
the action of the present legislature in
some matters that they have discuss
ed, and undertook to deal witn, dui
it is all right, I reckon, or it wouldn't
