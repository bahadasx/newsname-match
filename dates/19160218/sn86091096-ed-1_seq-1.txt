H.S. Boy's Essay
on Light Plant
Plant Will Start Soon
The electric light system of Ken
drick is now on the road to comple
tion. The field was entered by the
Potlatch Electric Co., Aug. 25, 1915.
JThey secured a franchise from the
Village Council Oct. 29,1915. Their
next consideration was to find a
sufficient amount of water power,
and with that idea in view, the
Potlatch creek between Kendrick
and the mouth of Cedar creek was
surveyed, and the available water
was measured. By placing a dam
three miles and a half above Ken
drick, it was found that there would
be sufficient power for all the needs
of Kendrick. The weather condi
tions were the next question to be
considered and upon investigation
the management was warmed by
"Oldtimers" against a water power
plant. They said that spring flood
would probly cause damage and
break downs for the plant. It was
finially decided to build a plant in
the town of Kendrick, and to use
«rude-oil engines as the prime
movers. The engines and generat
ing equipment were ordered on
October 20th. The engines have
100 horse power of electrical energy.
The tank, which holds 1000 gallons
«f oil, is buried in the ground
The company decided to extend
its lines to any point where sufficient
current could be sold to warrant
expenditure of money invested. So
they have extended their line to
Troy.
On account of war condition in
the east and the scarcity of all steel
products the machinery has been
delayed up to the present time, but
the plant will be in operation by the
first of March. The street lights
will be 100 candle power each and
be hung in the middle of the street
at each intersection.
The rates as issued by the author
ity of Public Utilities Commission
of the State of Idaho, on January
15th, 1916 shall be as follows.

Although Peck played their best
and put up a good game, Kendrick
was able to out class them. A num

the Kendrick players to have pre- \

Lincoln Day Banquet - Moscow
Big Republican Ralley — Over One Hundred and

Fifty
-- i
More than a hundred and fifty
north Idaho Republican gathered
at Moscow Saturday at a Lincoln
Day banquet and Republican love
feast. Party harmony and the re
uniting of the fragments into which
the party was divided in 1912 were
topics of interest, and many ex
cellent speeches were heard.
Following the banquet, a little
farce, "The Nominating of a Candi
date for Governor," written by W.
E. Lee and M. E. Lewis was given
by Homer David, impersonatinig ;

Music was furnished by the Uni
versity quartet.
In dealing with his subject, "The
Republican Party," F. S. Randall
of Lewiston sketched the history of
the party briefly, and pointed out
not only the specfic issues that lead
to the establishment of the party
but the principles for which the
party was to stand. Efficiency and
the practice of doing the thing at
hand, he said, characterized Lincoln
and the party. Success of the party
depends upon looking forward, not
backward, the speaker said, and he
gave as t j, e reason f or the defection
1912 the failure of theconserva
tives to advance as conditions de
mandcd and tne inc i inat ion of the
progressives to run ahead of the
spirit of the times. That fact has
been realized, and a reunited and
rejuvenated party will result.
Other speakers of the evening
were Messrs. Potts of Coeur d'Alene,
Buck of Lewiston, Becker of Orofi

Wallace, Elliott of Bonners Ferry,
McGowan of Moscow, Schulte of
St. Maries, Munson of Moscow,
Barton of Coeur d'Alene, Truitt of
Moscow, Crum of Lewiston, Porter

Grant of Elk River, and Hagen and
Lewis of Moscow.
The principle address of the even
ing was made by Hon. James F.
Ailshie of Coeur d'Alene.
After references to Lincoln Judge
Ailshie said: "For years we here
in Idaho have been promised and
promising better and a more econo
mically administered government, a
reduction of taxes and a restoration
of public confidence. We have
elected administration after adminis
tration committed to these pledges
and promises and all the while taxes
have been soaring higher, revenues
have been dissipated and the public
credit and good name of Idaho have
steadily depreciated. In the mean
while, great private foreign corpora
tion have been allowed to come in
and acquire large holdings of our
school and other public land grants

under the false promise of making
extensive public improvements and
constructing public utilities. In
almost every instance the state has
stood the loser.
"It seems to me that the processes
for the elimination of the evils
which now beset us must begin at
home and within ourselves. If we
would stand erect in the majesty of
our own integrity, refuse to tempo-
rize or corn-promise with wrong and
questionable practices, if we would
turn an absolutely deaf ear to the
insidious suggestions that the 'ends
justify the means,' we would effectu
ally block the operations that have
discredited the republican party in
Idaho and tarnished the good name
of the state.
"When some time ago Senator
Borah appealed to our 'state pride'
and amonished us to be aroused over
the aspect of things, he undoubtedly
had in mind something more than
the mere matter of our reputation
and d name abroad. He must
have been keenly alive to our condi
tion and needs here at home and he
knew that our character at home is
the matter of prime importance and
that when it is above reproach we
will have no need to fear for our
reputation abroad. I think our need
is to acquire into the underlying
and procuring cause of this political
unrest, lay bare its idenity and na
ture and then apply the remedy.
Judging from some of the things
that transpired nationally in 1912
this condition must have prevailed
in the republican party throughout
the country. We then even had
protracted debates and controversies
as to what really were the principles
teachings and doctrines of the great
emancipator.
"Here in Idaho there is enough
of the red blood of honesty and
courage to force the impurities to
the surface and free the body politic
of them and we should not be
frightened by the repulsiveness of
the operation. In some respects it
may take heroic treatment for noth
ing else will kill the the obnoxious
microbes but the sooner the life
giving germs get to working, the
sooner they will rid themselves of
the enemy.
We cannot avoid the self-evident
fact that we are in the path of pro
gress means that we shall all move
forward together and those who re
fuse to move are going to be moved.
The state is the social and political
unit through which we act collecti
vely and it is just as much the state
—the duty of Idaho, if you please—
to remove the handicaps and hind
rances and cause of wrong and
corruption as it is its duty to ad
minister justice and punish crime.
The Idaho character and the Idaho
reputation is going to be the aggre
gate results of the individual charac
ters and individual reputations of
her citizens—the qualities of the
elements are going to determine the
qualities of the mass.
"Let me appeal to you, my fellow
citizens of Idaho, to sound the call
to duty and clear the camps of the
Achans and Jonahs and restore to
power and authority the time-hon
ored party that Lincoln led to.its
first victory. Let the people of Ida
ho and the country as well learn
that the republican party^of this
state can survive both a donkey «
kick and a Caesarian operation and
come back chastened and purified,
and administer economical and
honest and righteous government."

Woody for Sheriff
We notice that John L. Woody
Commissioner of the third district
and chairman of the boaid is being
talked of as a possible candidate
for the office of Sheriff on the Re
publican ticket. Mr. Woody is
serving the people of the county
as a commissioner and has made
good in the office and has taken care
of his district in a very creditable
manner regardless of the condition»
of affairs that he has had placed be
f 0 re him. He has worked hard to
meet the demands of the people in
the county as a whole and is always
willing to meet any proposition on
an equal basis. It would be to our
minds better for the people to place
him again in the position he now
holds. He is thoroughly acquainted
with the workings of the county
and knows the need» of the differ
ent localities better than any new
officer would and it would take time
and expense to the county to get
another man into the harness as he
