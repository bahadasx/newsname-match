most Insistent.
"Youthful Is tho keynote of the

Waistline temlenres will lie lurgely
elllliloyed with rlpule effect below Hie
wnlat. Another style will be quite
loose and full, anil a shorter typo,
showing hip IctiKlli will be known as
the Colo.
Turn-liver collars mill sel-ln sleeves
will bo used on plainer models.
rtleevea with bell er wide ollect at
the wrlsl will also lie employed. Hells
will bo a feature of certain types of
suits. Knibnildery will nilil to Ihe nl
trnctlveliess of some designs.
Tlio new styles will lend them
selves lo production in silk or com
binations ot silk mid cloth. With
dressy types, cfti fleets and stiiiid-
ItiK soft fliirlng collar effects will be
used.
The new reals lire made on loose
lines, with Hie fullness slurtlim from

reach 111 the knees or BllBlillS below.
Much nlteiiliell Is being given lo Ihe

form.
Hells iippcnr on many models ami
tmrtteiilnny on inoliir and spurt routs
and are pliiced al tho raised, normal
or slluhlty lirnlipeil waistline. Pockets
of various kinds often give a smarl
finishing touch.
While a few hlah collars are being
shown In coats, many of these are
.onvertlble, as the tendency Is In
favor of the low, flat collar, or a
collar that Is high In the back and
sides, and opens at tho throat. A
few of Ihe high collars button
atralght down the front In a contiiin
oua line with tho bodice.
Cape collars nro being featured to
some oxtent and oblong collara. sllg

shown In many of the new Spring
garmenta. Variallona of the shawl
collar are looked upon with favor.
