Work, to Start Imme
diately
Formal call for bids for construction
of Aberdeen's new federal building is
sued this week from the U. S. treas
ury department, and Postmaster John
J. Carney within a day or two will
have the plans and specifications in
his hands. «
The building will cost $150,000, and
$45,000 bf this sum likely will be
available immediately. Additional
money for work most probably will
be included in the sundry civil service
bill, so that construction may be
pushed right on through this year and
next.
This action effectually stops all
further squabling over the federal
building site, which remains where
first selected at the corner of Second
and G streets.

MAY TRADE CHURCHES
The First Baptist and Swed
ish Baptist churches of Ho
quiam are dickering over terms
of a trade of edifices, according
to reports in the daily press.
The First Baptist structure is
too small, the Swedish too
large for the congregations;
which seems to make the trade
an easy matter of arranging.
The point that is hanging up
the deal, however, is that a $2,-
000 mortgage on the Swedish
church must be assumed by the
other congregation, to make a
trade.

COMMISSION
DEBATE GETS
HUGE CROWD
Large Audience Jams the
Bijou for Debate Held
Wednesday
INTERESTS WOMEN
Speakers Hold Attention
of Crowd by Good
Arguments
Temper and convictions of the audi
ence in the Bijou theater, Wednesday
night, that listened to a debate on the
commission form of city government,
were not demonstrated by the occa
sional bursts of applause, but the in
terest felt by the assemblage certain
ly was proven, by the close attention
paid speakers as well as by the
plaudits and queries volleyed a time
or two at the platform.
Upholding the present councilmanic
government, J. W. Clark and W. J.
Patterson were precise and pungent
in their challenges to opponents to
show cause for change. Clark em
phasized the 28 years' municipal his
tory since incorporation of the town,
with never a charge of graft. Patter
son, while admitting that change to
commission form would be a step in
progress, yet believed that Aberdeen
might better wait a year or two until,
with 20,000 population and ranking as
a city of the first class, it could pick
its own charter and take the final
step to city manager form.
Neither T. B. Bruener nor John J.
Carney, in their arguments for the
commission form, criticized present or
past councils, but each boldly assert
ed that the councilmanic system was
utterly indefensible for a city of Ab
erdeen's position. Bruener devoted
his time to exposition of the com
mission plan applied to any city. Car
ney plunged into "cases" and drew
comparisons between Hoquiam and
Aberdeen, in the past four years, to
the distinct disadvantage of the lat
ter city. Hoquiam's present financial
embarrassment, he said, was due to
the saturnalia of extravagance pre
vailing there before the city adopt
ed commission form.

One more of the series of damage
[ claims on account of frozen pipes was.
| presented to the city council, Wednes
day night, by D. C. Crivyear, 2206 Sum
! ner avenue, Hoquiam. He asked for
$35 compensation for his house st
2709 Sumner avenue, this city, being
flooded, declaring that he had notified,
the water department to shut the wat
er off and that failure to do so was
cause of pipes' bursting. Claim was
referred to the water committee and.
city attorney.
On motion of Councilman John Fr»-
ser, the auditing committee was in
structed to report on extra expendl
tures which caused the higher tax
rate this year, such as purchase of
West bridge, bond interest, loss of Bfr
loon licenses and other reasons.
Final payment for work on the
Wishkah road was ordered made to
A. H. Moulton, of $878. Contract for
furnishing 17,500 feet of iron pipe

ment was set ahead a week.
The West bridge was ordered closed
from March 1 to April 1 for permanent
repairs.
Rev. Charles McDermoth, as char

SHIPYARDS HERE
MEANS MUCH TO

The decision, arrived at last Mon

more to Aberdeen than has any bust
i ncss announcement, likely, in tJlft past'
,*car or two. The yards will be located
on the Wishkah rivt-r near the end
of the B street car Hne, on property
secured from Carl Gylling.
Laying of the keel of the first ves- -1
sel, for the Wilson Bros mill company,
will be started March 1, the craft to
have a 1,000,000-feet capacity. Sever
al other contracts are to be secured,
it is understood, immediately by Pet
erson, and the shipyards will employ
about 100 men as soon as they are
running at full blast, which will be by
the end of next month.
Peterson's reputation is high as a
shipbuilder, the steamer Mulkiteo, one
of the largest wooden vessels on the
coast, having been turned out by him.
Shipyard supplies which he has at
