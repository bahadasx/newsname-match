Oklahoma Cl. 16.- Tho cor
respondent of L . juallas Nqwh has
the following In his fripor today re
garding tho proceedings of tho Legis
lature: "Wo now have a record In, the Jour
nal that will bo used beforo long to
wfpo.out or modify tho prosent form
of tho Legislature." .
Senator J. EImor 'Thomas made
this declaration to tho preBS tablojif
tcr tho Sonato had refused by a con
siderable majority to adopt a joint
resolution Introduced by Suthorlln of I
Wagoner purouant to recommenda
tions of the Governor limiting special
sessions of tho Legislature to thirty
days and to subjects contained In tho
'proclamation.
The resolution has boon on tho cal
endar since tho early days of the ses
sion. When it was called up therfe
wuB a.clamor to postpone It or kill it
by some sort o flegtslattvo tactics.
Mr. Barrett of Pottowatomle de
clared that tho Legislature needed
Jots of time, that Its liberty of action
should not bo curtailed; that whllo
this Is his last term, he would not
hampor future lawmakers by any In
fringements of their rights. He then
pointed to tho .fact that this is the
thirty-second day of this session and
that tho Legislature is not yet fin
ished with Its work.
"Thojpeople would glvo thanks If
the Constitution prohibited tho call
ing of any extraordinary sessions,"
declared Mr. Davis of Creek.
"Would you not also got plaudits
If you-proposed to abolish tho Leg
islature altogether?" Inquired Mr.
Blckel of Woods.
"That would be a very popular
movement," was tho reply.
A tempest wasMarted in the Houst
by Mr, Sams of' Nowata moving that
tho Commltteo on Elections be requir
ed to report to the Houso how many
signatures hafi been received on the
hundreds of petitions that have boon
sent in from th'o several counties
making that no restriction on suf
frage bo attempted by the Legislature
now in session He said that his In
formation is that 130,000 signatures
are oh these petitions. Ho sent up
one with four hundred names on it
and said that it was froiw Bryan
county, tho homo of tho Governor,
and the floor leader of tho Demo
cratic party, Mr, Durant.
A motion by Mr. SItton of Steph
ens to lay on the tablo was followed
by debate and then adopted. A num
ber of Democrats declared that they
had examined tho signatures on pe
titions from their home counties and
that they could not find the names of
any persons whom they knew, al
though they wore well acquainted in
their districts. They declared that
many of the names must bo fictitious.
Mr. Durant of Bryan said that
early in the session when, it was de
cided thnt such petitions would not
be read in the Houso his suggestion
to this effect' was in behalf of econ
omy and that the time of tho Houso
ouyht not to be taken 'up In this way
every day hearing potltlpns, and that
mention of their receipt In tho Jour
nal wis compliance with the doctrine
that the right of petition shall bo
preserved to tho poople.
The House killed the penitentiary
coal mine bill. Its exocutlon is u
blow to tho administration, but It
was oxpocted. The labor Influence
that has been opposing this bill was
nctive and energetic. This disposes
adversely of one more of the matters
submitted as important in the opin
ion of tho Governor,
Tho Senate adopted the much
nmonded usury law. It has gone to
the Houso and may there have some
consideration. This bill makes It
possible to plead usury and tho
claim ifor tho penalty undor existing
laws is a cross petition Instead of re
quiring a separate action to recover.
It provides that tender of principal
and legal interest shall discharge tho
dobt; that tho transferee of a note
t oan Innocent purchaser shall be li
able to tho maker forall the usurious
interest taken thoreln; that action
may bo brought to forfeit charters of
banks making idans at usurious rates
of interest upon instruction by the
Governor. An amendment by Mr,
Keller of- Lovo making usurious con
tracts void as to principal And inter
est, vwas killed. Tho Senate paused
the bill by Mr. Bickcl of Woods 'de
fining potlt money-landers, providing
for foes in excess of interest and li
censing loan-sharks who operated la
"sums of less than $300 on chattel se
curities, salaries and furniture.
Tho bill by Mr, Mcintosh, creating
the office of Eighth Assistant Attor
ney General, was also passed by tho
Senate,
Tho Houso killed tho poll tax bill
by Mr. Gardner of Choctaw. It pass
ed the bill appropriating $25,000 for
equipping roa.d camps for prisoners
sof tho Stafe, andthe bill, making
appropriation lot purchase of lands

Tho United States, It was said by
tho Statu" Department at Washington
yesterday, concedes the entente al
liesard within their rights undor prevailing-international
law In arming
merchant Bhlps for dofenslvo purpqs
os, no Matter what conditions exist
on tho BoaB. Consequently it is ad
mitted that should the- allies decline
,to "adopt the American suggestion to
disarm merchantmen found primar
ily upon a desire to savo tho lives of
juuuueni non-comoatants tins gov-
ommeht cannot announce Its approv
al of tho lntontlons of the Teutonic
powors to torpedo without warning
aftor February 29 all armed vossels,
although various high officials aro
convinced that tho position of Gor
many nnd Austria is Justified.
State Department officials aro now
engaged In trying to dotormlno what
will happon, when tho commanders
of German and. Austrian submarines
begin to pu their now Instructions
Into effect It Is said, too, that tho
United States In tho near futuro may
ntako some .Inquiries as to how tho
central powers Intend to determino
whether marchantmen encountered
by their submarines aro armefl.
In response to inquiries regarding
this aspect It was said by a high Ger
nfan authority today thafthe German
and Austrian govornm,a8 would un
der no circumstances disregard Ihe
assurances which have been given to
tho United States . In regard to the
conduct pf submarine warfare.
Attention was called particularly
to tho fact that that the German gov
ernment had assured the United
States that passenger liners would
not bo attacked without warning. It
is said that theso assurances had not
and would not be repudiated and for
that reason liners In Bervlce between
tjie United States and Western Eu
rope would not be attacked without
warning, eVen If they had defensive
armament aboard.
. Toutonlc officials were inclined to
believe that such an Issue would not
arlso.sGroat Britain has agreed
thaTshlps entering American waters
shall not be armed. In- botll dlplb
matle and official circles doubt oven
was expressed that the new policy
would in tho slightest way affect con
ditions on the Atlantic, although it
was admitted that should the Italian
government persist In arming its
merchantmen difficulty might arise
in the Mediterranean.
Stato Denartment officials recog
nize that the action of the German
and Austrian governments Is a de
velopment of the recent American
suggestions'. Tho department, how
ever, does not feel obligated to take
any action in rogard to tho broad
questions involved, at least until It
received replies to Us own memoran
dum to Lie entente alliances regard
ing the disarming of merchantmen.
Consideration Is being given to the
advisability. of v amending the Instruc
tions to port authorities In regard to
the rights of merchantmen to arm. for
defensive purposes and the limita
tions of the armament.

Front Lino Trench Over Distance of
' KightHundrcd Yards Near Ypres
is Occupied by tho Germans Oth
er News From drcat War.
Switching tholr offensive from the
Artols and Champagne regions In
France to tho Belgian sector around
Ypres hold by the British, the Ger
mans have smashed their way by an
tlllery bombardment and Infantry at
tacks into a British front line trench
over a distance of 800 yards, tho dis
tance given by tho Berlin advices on
the advance, British offltilals, whllo
admitting tho gain on the part of tho
Teutons, say that It was for only 600
yards. Berlin says that the majority
of the dofonders of tho trench were
killed and that ono officer and sevor
al dozens of soldiers were takon pris
oners of war.
In tho Artols region, between Lens
and Bothuno, 'tho crater of a mlno
blown up by the Qormans was occu
pied by them, while tho French guns
have been busy shelling German or
ganizations in the neighborhood of
the road to Lille. The French also
bombarded German positions north
of Vlc-Sur-Alsno and northeast of Sol
ssons and In the Argonno, exploding
a mine, and occupied the crater.
In Champagne, Berlin nsserts the
French Infantry attempts to regain
lost positions north of Tahure were
repulsed, as likewise was a similar
attack n the Vosges near Ober Sept.
There has been a considerable re
newal of tho activity on the Russian
front around Dvinsk to tho south of
the Prlpet River and along the Upper
and Middle Stripe River, but no Im
portant changes have occurred.
Tho Italians are still using tholr
guns and Infantry in attempting to
retake from tho AuBtro-Hungarlans
the positions recently recaptured on
Monte Rombon, but all attempts so
far have been repulsed with heavy
losses.
The Russlas are still on the offen
sive against the Turks in the Cau
casus region, but Constantinople re
ports that tholr attacks have, been
halted by counter-attacks. In Meso
potamia the situation around Kut-El-Amara
and Felahlo, where tho
British aro operating against the
Turks, Is unchanged.
Important Russian Victory
From Petrograd the official an
nouncement was made Thursday of
this week that tho Russian army un
der Grand Duke Nicholas, has "grant
ed the army of the Caucasus such
great holp that Erzerum has been
taken afjtor iflvo days of unprece
dented assault."
The capture of Erzerum Is consid
ered of great strategic Importance.
From It radiate reads leading In all
directions. Over those to the south
east and south It will be possible for
tho Russians- to fight tholr way to
ward their compatriots operating
against the Persians and Turks In
Northwest and West Persia or pro
ceed so'uth toward Bagdad to the re
lief of the Brltlnh bottled up at Kut-El-Amara,
on the Tigris, southeast
of Bagdad.
END OF THE LUSITANIA
CAC i. NOW IN SIGHT
Washington, Feb. 16. Germany
is understood to have agreed to tho
suggestion of the United States that
she substitute the words "recognizes
liability" for tho words "assumes li
ability" In the tentative draft of the
communication designed to setlJQthe
Lusitania case. The revised draft
was received here last night from
Berlin. It Is to bo submitted to all
officials concerned, both of this coun
try and Gormauy, today, and will In
all Jlkollhood settle definitely the
long drawn but controversy over the
matter .
Several other changes doslred by
the United States and described as
being of minor importance, are also
said to have been made. In one In
stance, however, Gormany U under
stood to have proposed a ohango In
the language suggested by the Amer
ican government.
From high oflclal authority ha3
come'the statement that It Is thought
the mattor will bo fully settled to the
complete satisfaction of the United
States government nnd of Gormany
at the conference to be held today or
tomorrow between Secretary Lansing
and Count von Bernstorf f.
American officials have already as
serted that tho two governments are
"substantially in accord."
Settlement May We DcluYed
Washington. Feb. 18. The sub
marine controversy with Go;Jaihny
cannot bo closed until tho United
States has fully considered tho possi
ble effect of tho Intention of the
Germanic powors to sing all unarmed
merchant ships of their enemies with
no warning after the 29th o? this
month.
This announcement was made by
Secretary Lansing today Instead of
the lone expected announcement of
1a' satisfactory settlement of vtbb Lu
sltanlaV mattor. .- '.N .
Balky Democrats In tho Houso. Arc
anld to bo lilocklng Action on Ono
of tho Chief Objects of tho Spcc
inl-Scsslo of tho Legislature.
Thero Is an outlook for tho defeat
of the omorge'ncy clause of the elec
tion bill that had Us first hearing in
tho House Tuesday. The bill had
been passed by tho Senate, two Dem
ocrats In that body voting against
It, thoy being Mr. Cr i-pontor of Gioev,
nnd Mr. Kline of Kayf TJSe bill must
pass both houses with the emergency
section in it if it is to bo available
for tho coming olcctionB or at all,
for tho Intention of tho Republicans
and Socialists is to circulate petitions
for a referendum in case the act shall
not become Iminedhitely effective.
In order to secure a two-thirds
jyoto In the House tho bill must re
ceive alxty-slx votes on final roll
call. The Houso as elected had seventy-six
Democratic members. Thero
aro four vacancies nnd ono member
has been absent throughout the ses
sion, too HI to attend. This leaves
seventy-one Democrats. Opponents
of tho, election bill aro pointing to fif
teen names of Democrats who are
opposed to this law. They do not be
lieve In tho plan. No Republican or
Socialist votes will be cast for the
bill. Six Democrats can. defeat the
bill, bo far as making It Immediately
effective Is concerned.
The House Democrats have cau
cused and caucused In an endeavor
to framo plans to propitiate tho re
calcitrant mombors of that body, pos
sibly with the bait of getting thorn to
help out on the usury law. Tho out
look for a two-thirds majority on tho
olecllon bill la bad, though possibly,
nt the eleventh hour, some argument
made be made to get the necessary
number of Democrats.
The House killed the resolution of
the Senate for an amendment to tho
Constitution affixing a tax of 4 per
cent on the gross production of petro
leum. This was a Russel resolution.
It is understood that the weight of
tip Administration was not thrown
in Bup'port of the measure, 'as it was
In the'ease of the taxing bill that be
came a law Monday fixing the rate
of this tax at 3 per cent.
The House killed the deficiency
appropriation of $85,000 for the pen
itentiary at McAlester, the fight on
this Item, having been led by Mr.
Simpson of Custer. Several smaller
appropriation bills were passed fi
nally by the House, Including the
support of the University medlval
department and the $10,000 for ex
penses and pay of tho Legislature.
This bill has yet to reach tho Senate
and the Governor. Tuesday was pay
day for tho Legislature and the em
ployes, they receiving the last of tho
money mado available for thirty
days, Tuesday being the thirtieth.
day.
Tho House adopted the joint res
olution by Mr. Harrison of Hughes,
which authorizes settlement of the
gross production tax tangle, so far
as tho producers are concerned, by
paying back to them, tho amount of
the tax collected on the royalty In
terest. This amounts to about $100,-
000. This compromise was arranged
by State Auditor Howard. The Sen
ate likewise passed a declaratory act
that Is cauculated to adjust the liti
gated question as to the distribution
of the revenues that are in hand to
the amount of a million or more dol
lars by allowing the portion that Is
payable to the Bchool funds go to the
counties from which it was collected
in-proportion as they paid it, Instead
of per capita to all tho scholastics,
as tho original Intention of tho law
was assum,ed by Its author to bo.
Representative Ball, In the course
of remarks In opposition to tho ap
propriation bill, took occasion to
criticise the course which he alleged
was followed by Governor Williams
lu calling on members to vote for the
RubsoII tax bill.
