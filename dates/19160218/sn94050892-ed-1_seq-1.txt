MAY SHIP LIQUOR
NTQ ARIZONA FOR
PERSONAL-USE
Holds No drime to Drink or Possess
Liquor, Therefore Unconstitutional
to Prohibit Introduction for Person
al Use.
That one may bring liquor Into the
state of Arizona for personal use was
held by the supreme court last Sat
urday in an opinion reversing the
court below in the case of W. J.
SturgeoDv appellant against the state
respondent, from Yuma county. The
defendant had been tried for introducing-
a bottle of wine across the line
at Yuma. -His demurrer on the
ground that the liquor was introduced
for his personal use was overruled.
At the trial he sought to prove that
the liquor was brought in for that pur
pose, but proof was denied. That
was held v to be error and the case
was reversed and remanded for a
new trial.
After quoting section 1 of the prohi
bition amendment, the court finds that
three crimea defined sand de
nounced: The traffic in intoxicating
liquors, the manufacture of intoxicat
ing liquors,and introducing or attempt
ing to introduce intoxicating liquors..
The opinion then deals with the
contention of the appellant it his trial
(that the rTO-'.on of the constitution
against the introduction of liquor is
unconstitutional as an attempt to regu
late interstate commerce. The various
latL-a rolatinir tn Hrfimr in interstate
commerce were then cited, with de
cisions bearing upon them up to the
Webb-Kenyon law, "an act divesting
intoxicating liquors of their interstate
character in certain cases." That act
state, "to be received, possessed, sold
or in any manner used either in the
original package or otherwise, in vio
lation of any law of such state."
A quotation is made from Justice
Day's opinion in the case of the Adams
Express company vs. Kentucky, show
ing to what extent congress has ex
tended prohibition of the act with ref
erence to interstate shipments and a
quotation is also made from the
court's own decision . in the Gherna
j case last spring,', upholding the right
of the -state to enact such legislation
as had been enacted in the prohibition
amendment.
The opinion continues:
"It being settled that traffic in in
toxicating liquor in this state is a
crime, it follows that fhe shipment,
transportation or introduction of in
toxicating liquor into- the state with
. the intention to sell, barter, exchange
give away, or dispose of, divests, under
the Webb-Kenyon act, such intoxicat
ing liquor of its interstate commerce
character and leaves the state free in
' the exercise of its police powers to de
nounce such introduction as a crime
and to prescribe penalties for its com-
mission. In other -words, one who in
troduces intoxicaiting liquor into the
state with the purpose ' and Intention
. of violating the laws of the state by
disposing of the same may not now
Interpose the defense that he is en
gaged in Interstate commerce, for the
- reason that- the article that he Is
handling has been invested of . its
Interstate .character by1 -the Webb
, Kenyan act. Intoxicating liquor. in
the aspect of .being 'received, possess--ed,
or kept, or in some way used in
a manner prohibited by the laws of
the state to which it is to be, or is da
fact, imported," is an outlaw, and di
vested of its interstate character and
withdrawn from interstate protection
at the hands 'of the federal govern
ment. "
Coming to the chief issue In the
same, the court says: .
The appellant sought to show, by
- preference, that the liquor with which
he is charged with introducing dnto
the state was for his personal use,
upon the theory that the prohibition
amendment to the constitution does
not denounce or define personal use
of Indicating liquors as a crime. He
contends that it is not unlawful in this
state to have in possession or rto
drink Intoxicating 'liquors; that the
Webb-Kenyon act does not divest or
attempt to divest intoxicating liquors
of their interstate character when
shipped, transported or inrtoduced
into the state from without the state
to be possessed or used for a lawful
purpose.
Search the prohibition amendment
and you will. there is no suggestion or
information in any form contained
therein, prohibiting the possession or
individual consumpoitn of intoxicating
liquors in Arzona. Indeed, it was
freely admitted upon the argument
by counsel who appealed as amici
curio that It is not a crime to possess
or drink intoxicating liquors, in Arir
zona, -and while the attorney general,
at least in a brief, insists that the
use or possession is a crime, he fails
to cite us to a single instance where a
prosecution has been begun in any
county of the' state against any per
son for drinking intoxicating liquors
or having it in his possession.
The records of the courts through
out the state evidence many prosecu
tions for the sale of intoxicating li
quors since the prohibition amend
ment tt-pnt into Affor.t. it is common
knowledge that personal use has
been more or less prevalent through
out the state and the effort has been
not to punish the user, but the seller
thereof. The bootlegger and not his
patrons have had the attention of the

Collision Between Automobile and
Globe Train in Gila Valley Ends
Fatally for Fifteen Year Old Boy.
SAFFORD, Feb. 16. Voris Horem,
15 year old son of Reverend Horem
cf Safford was killed and Oscar O'
Brien, son of Mrs. O'Brien, propriet
oress of the Gila Valley Furinshing
company, also of Safford, was pain
fully injured last night when the
Globe-bound passenger train struck an
automobile in which the boys were
riding, one mile and a half south of
Lone Star station.
The tragedy occurred so swiftly
that no steps could be taken to avoid
it. Just as the speedjng train ap
proached a crossing. Fireman Zim
merman saw an automobile drive into
the circle of light thrown by the loco
motive. Before the engineer could
apply the brakes the machine and Its
occupants- had been hurled from the
tracks. The train was brought to a
halt as quickly as possible and the
passengers streamed forth to discover
the cause of the abrupt halt.
Deputy Sheriff Gilmer was the first
to reach young Horem who was found
fully a hundred yards from the spot
where the accident occurred. The
boy had a terrible gash in the side
of his head, believed to have been
caused by striking a wheel of the
automobile, which was lying near
him and he was bleeding profusely.
Examination disclosed that the lad
was still living. O'Brien was found
to be badly shaken up and bruised,
having been thrown about forty yards,
but was not seriously injured.
Both unfortunates were placed on
stretchers, and -without waiting to
clear up the track, the train made a
record run to Safford to obtain medi
cal aid. However, the efforts of the
railroad men .were of no avail, , as
young Horem passed away a few mo
ments after he was placed on the car.
A doctor, who examined the body at
Safford gave it as his opinion that
the boy's neck was broken.
Oscar O'Brien who is but thirteen
years of age, was unconscious but a
few moments. When he was able to
speak coherently, he stated that nei
ther he ncr his comrade had seen
or heard the train before the acci
dent and that until he was revived
on the train, he was not aware what
had struck the automobile.

g.o p: leaders put
forth slate for
Von Campbell Has Bsen Decided
Upon For Gubernatorial Nomination
Wi'i Hon. Jos. H. Kibbey For U.
Si Senate.
A dispatch from Phoenix headed
'Arizona G. O. P. :ate Prepared;
Tentative State Ticket Is Selected as
Feeler, But Is Subject to Changes,"
says:
Here is just about the way the Ari
zona Republican ticket is going to
look this year:
IT. S. Senator, Joseph H. Kibbey,
Phoenix.
Congressman, J. Knox Corbett,
Tucson. (,
Governor, Thomas E. Campbell,
Prescott.
Secretary of State, Ralph G. Whit
marsh, Phoenix.
Auditor, Joe V. Prochaska, Miami.
Treasurer, J. -Myron Allred, Saf
ford. Corporation commissioner, Thomas
Maddock, Williams.
Attorney general, E. S. Clark, Pres
cott.
School superintendent, Charles F.
Philbrook, Bisbee.
Tax Commissioner, Rudolph Kuch
ler, Glendale.
Supreme judge, Frank O. Smith,
Prescott. .
Mine inspector, J. M. Smith, Bis
bee. This is the slate. It is tent-Hive
and several changes are almost sure
to be made. Butthe leaders, in or
ganizing the G. O. P. throughout the
State, are going on the theory that
these men will be candidates at the
primaries. They are accepting sug
gestions from no matter what source.
They accepted and considered many
suggestions before they decided to put
forth the above ticket-as a "feeler."
Care Ttaken to Pick Good Ones
The greatest of care has been exer
cised to select men who are not
only popular and good campaigners,
but who are competent to fill the offi
ces. A number of disinterested par
ties, perponally acquainted with prac
tically all the candidates, are of the
opinion that it would be hard to put
forth a ticket more likely to get the
support of voters. Kibbey, Campbell,
Prochaska, Philbrook, . and the two
Smiths are perhaps the strongest men
on the suggested ticket but not one
i3 a "weak sister."
One Question Settled
The leaders debated long and earn
estly whether it would be wiser to
run Kibbey or Campbell for gov
ernor. This matter was decided by
the men themselves. Kibbey was
governor of Arizona in territorial
days and would rather go to Wash
ington than back to that office.
Campbell believes that he would have
little opportunity to serve Arizona in
the senate and stated positively that
he would be a candidate for governor
or nothing. So it was settled.
It is quite possible that Kibbey will
not be the only person to go before
the Republican voters at the primaries
as a candidate for senator. Robert E.
Morrison, of Prescott, has . announced
that he would like very much (to be
, senator.
i- Kibbey is willing. "We want the
strongest candidates we can -get and
if Mr. Morrison can get more votes
'at . the primaries It is likely that he
can get more at the election," re-
' marked Kibbey. .
I , Campbell Wants Clear Field
I Campbell, on the other hand, In
: sists that he 'be not opposed at the
I primaries. He wants to feel sure that
there is a general demand for his
.services in the governor's chair,
i J. Knox Corbett has not figured un
1 til recently in the plans of the Re
publicans. For a number of years
he was postmaster of Tucson and he
is strong- throughout the southern
counties. In the north he is not so
w,ell known, but he is a good cam
paigner and a first-class "mixer."

SCHOOL IMPROVEMENTS
Trustees Propose Bond Issue For
Better Accommodation of Children.
For some time past the Board of
Trustees of this District felt the
necessity of additional room at 'the
grammar school building in Hill's Ad
dition. Although the eighth grade
pupils were this year moved to the
High School building, some of the
grammar school rooms are overcrowd
ed. After giving the matter careful
consideration the Board of Trustees,
Messrs: Alt, Coffee and Risdon, at a
special meeting held on February 14,
decided to relieve the congested con
dition at the Hill's Addition school,
and at the same time provide for a
gymnasium building to be used also
as an Auditorium, manual training
and domestic science building, By the
erection of this building the sixth
and seventh grades can be transfer
red from the grammar school to the
High School building.
It is estimated that the total cost
will be in the neighborhood of $25,
000 and a bond issue will be propos
ed for the following purposes:
1. To purchase lots In Chase
Creek.
2. To purchase lots in rear of
High School.
3. To build and equip a manual
training, domestic science and art,
gymnasium and auditorium building.
4 To improve the High School lots,
and South Clifton School and grounds
and building in North Clifton and
place fire escapes on all buildings.
The plan proposed by the trustees
is meeting with popular favor among
the patrons of the school and the
idea of a school gymnasium is one
heartily rommended. It is probable
that the bond election for this pur
pose will be held some time in March

In accordance with that statement
the mine managers invited a com

with them for that purpose . this

on Thursday morning at ten o'clock in
the general offices of the Arizona Cop

When the committee made its first
appearance it was made up of

number of committeemen too large
(and suggested that the number be

yet. " According to reports emanat

joying most pleasant,, relations and
the sessions so far have been marked
by good feeling on both Bides.
It is leATOAfl that mnM nrrvo-rafia
was made oh Thursday afternoon
in disposing of some questions, A
mutual agreement was made that
uiv nnii.mmm. wttge iu .uu .aiBinci lor
common labor should never drop be
low two dollars a day for eight hours,
regardless of any 'sliding scale that
might be introduced. Also it was
mutually agreed that there would be
no discrimination' on 'account - of
membership In any labor organiza

part of employees against any em
ployee who was not a member of
any organization.
According to reports very little prog
ress was made by the conference on
Friday, most of the session being
spent in a discussion of the sliding
scale and the policy of the compan
ies in this district in paying for
seven and -one-half hours work un
derground instead of eight, the de
duction of thirty minutes being nbde
for the lunch hour. The conferees
are contending for eight hours pay
maintaining that the eight hour law
contemplates pay for all time the
men actually spend under ground.
The sliding scale under discussion
provides for a different rate of In
crease for different classes of labor
as copper advances one cent per
pound. It is stated that the con
ferees are advocating the same rate
of Increase for all classes of labor. -
Every Indication points to an ami
cable adjustment of all mattters un
der discussion, all rumors of a dead
lock and open split to the contrary,
notwithstanding.
