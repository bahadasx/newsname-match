ATTACKS ADMINISTRATION
With Split in Democratic Ranks G.
O. P. Leaders See Victory in
November Elections.
Throughout the nation and state
of Montana the republican forces are
being martialled for the coming cam- '
paign, and never before has there J
been more enthusiasm displayed or (
prospects brighter for a nation-wide
victory.
On Saturday, February 12, Lin
coln's birthday, the republican state
central committee was in session in
Helena. Not in many years had they
held such an enthusiastic meeting,
and while there was hot much for the
committee to do, the meeting was
characterized by enthusiasm and a
confidence that the November returns i
will place the party back in power
Delegates to the meeting reported
conditions very favorable throughout
the state. Judge C. L. Crum of For
syth stated that he had been holding
court the last three years in practic
ally every eastern Montana county
and that from a republican standpoint
conditions were infinitely better than
in the last two general elections; that
practically all the progressives have
returned to the fold and that a solid
front will be presented to the demo
crats.
One candidate, whose election east
ern Montana republicans feel is an
absolute certainty, continued Judge
Crum, is Senator Edwards, a candi
date to succeed H. L. Myers in the
United States senate. He said the
rank and file of the voters are al
most unanimously behind his candi
dacy.
He referred to the great influx of
settlers during the last few years.
They have come from republican
states "and they won't do the demo
cratic party one bit of food this fall,"
he added.
General satisfaction was expressed
by republicans in attendance over the
announcement of the return to the re
publican party of Joseph M. Dixon.
"The republicans and progressives
united can control Montana," said F.
A. Hazelbaker of Dillon.
"Conces- j
sions on both sides should be made,
fo. at heart the two parties stand
for the same principles and the
same policies."
The keynote of the G. O. P. nation
al campaign was sounded Tuesday in
the meeting of the New York repub
lican state central committee by for
mer United States Senator Elihu
Root. In a speech that fired the first
gun in the battle on the democratic
rufe in Washington, Elihu Root de
clared that the democrats have made
threats to Mexico and failed to make
them good, that the return of the re
publican party to power would bring
new life to business and that the re
publicans promise prosperity and
honor in the administration of the pa
tional affairs.
, j
Mr. Root charged the present
ministration "with the lack of fore
sight to make timely provision for
backing up American diplomacy by
actual or assured military force;
with "the forfeiture of the worlds
respect for our assertion of rights by
pursuing the policy of making threats
and failing to make them good," and
with "a loss of moral forces of the
civilized world through failure to tru
ly interpret to the world the spirit
of American democracy in its atti
administration's 'three fundamental
errors.'"
If the republican party is returned
to power, Mr. Root stated that the
people of the United States may ex
pect that their government will meet
the economic situation with which
must deal immediately upon the close
of the war, with a policy of moderate,
but adequate protection to American
industry, based upon ascertained and
established facts and inspired byi
sympathy with all honest American
enterprise and a desire for the pros-,
perity and happiness of Americans of
every calling and in every state.
"They may expect that the best
possible course for the preservation
of peace will be followed by a for
eign policy, which, with courtesy and
'"»ndliness to all nations if frank
anu irless and honest in its asser
tion Oi American rights, will leave
no doubt anywhere in the world of
America's purpose and courage to
protect and defend her independence,
her territory and lives and just rights
of her citizens under the law of na
tions. They may expect that their
government will stand for full and
adequate preparation by the Ameri
can people for their own defense."

self in the head. Before turning the
gun on himself, Conrad sent a bul
let crashing into the head of Mrs.
Elizabeth Coulter.
TRAGEDY AT HAVRE.
Preston L. Conrad, a well known
railway conductor, committed suicide
That Conrad was insane is the gen
eral opinion of those who have ob
served his actions the past few
months. About seven months ago he
was knocked from the top of a freight
train and railroad men say that he
never entirely recovered from the ac
cident.
Conrad died instantly, but Mrs.
Coulter withstood the shock and will,
probably recover.

about every little bunch now met with

Whether or not Glasgow is to con

eastern Montana in the pastime is of,
much importance. If a good team is
to be had for the 1916 season, now i
is the time for laying plans and
"preparedness" being the password,
to all things at the present, let us get
to work at once.
A meeting will be held in the Com
night February 23, at 8 o'clock for
the purpose of discussing the coming
season and. to find out if Glasgow
will have a team this year.
Come out and let your opinion of
the subject be heard. This will be

If no team

NEW SAVINGS SYSTEM.
A n&v system of teaching the
school children of the city to save
will be introduced in the Glasgow
public schools. It is called the
"System Bank" way and its practic
ability assures it of success.
Mr. Carlton A. Grier of Coeur j
d'Alene, Idaho was in the city this
given a very cordial reception by.

ad-.both bankers and school officials and|
expects to have the system m op-.
«ration during the early part of
March.
State Superintendent H ..A. Davee
i s very enthusiastic over the new idea
and in this regard says: |
"The Helena schoofs have just in-1
I
troduced school savings banks using '
the "System Ban*" way. This system]
has many advantages over the plan
generally used; no expense to the
schools; no financial responsibility to
f to pupil and parent.
! "Thrift is one of the great needs
j of the nation. There is an old Ger
man maxim to the effect that what
| ever you wish to come out in the life
of the nation should be put into the
we-public schools. We are fast becoming
! a nation of spendthrifts. Why not
put a school savings bank in your
j school this year?"

JOHNSON ALIVE,
The report that Carl Johnson had
mysteriously disappeared and it was
feared that he had frozen to death,
|Was incorrect, says the Opheim Op
timist. The report had geen gener

Johnson was hibernating at the home
of his brother.
WILL FURNISH
FREE BEET SEED
Commercial Club to Supply the
Farmers for Making Tests.
FARMERS TO CO-OPERATE
Successful Tests Will be • Big Fac
tor in Getting a Sugar Beet
Factory Located Here.
The Glasgow Commercial club will
have a limited quantity of sugar beet
seed this year to distribute among!
farmers for experimental work.
It is the intention of the club to,
place the sugar beet seed in the hands
of farmers owning land under irri
gation when water will be turned ini
the ditch. No beets will be grown on!
bench lands as this is of no benefit !
to the development of sugar beets
commercially in the district.
Owing to the scarcity of sugar beet
seed in America it is a very difficult
matter to secure enough to make a
practical test as was done in 1915.
The Commercial club has managed
to get a limited amount of seed and
it will be given out only in small
quantities and every farmer securing
the seed must be willing to grow the
beets according to direction furnished.
No greater work for the benefit of
the farmers and business men can be
accomplished than that of developing.
the real facts about sugar beet grow
ing i n Lower Milk River Valley. Peo- ^
le locally are satisfied the beets ca n i
be grown here to profitable advant- j
age but the work cannot stop wit
that assurance alone. It must be
demonstrated to the satisfaction of
those who can and will invest their
money in a plant before the work can
be called complete. The only way to,
do this is by growing the sugar beets
on the.farm according to the methods
required by a factory so that the
very best results may be produced. It
is the percentage of sugar, the purity
! of the beet grown, and not the big
ness of the beet that is essential. To
get the proper results, extra work i.
required. The Commercial club is
wiling to spend money and time t»<
help develop this industry *Jb*
farmer will do his share thoroughly
and as required, the battle will be
I .. u ir
a;more than half won.
I Farmers willing to assist in this
^ ^
the vaU should communi .
with the Commercial club at once.
The seed will be distributed about,
J March 15, and the club wishes to
know just how many farmers will co
operate in this work.

Prairie—Found in Drifts
Five Days Later.
Tom Benedick, the ten-year-old son
of N. Benedick, an Austro-Russian,
near the Canadian line, and Alex Hun
jak, a brother of Mrs. Benedick,
were found frozen to death on Friday,
February 3, between the Roanwood
store and the Benedick claim.
The Benedicks ran short of pro
visions during the blizzard, which
raged for several days during the
first part of the month, and Hunjak
and the boy walked over to the
Roanwood store Sunday afternoon to
get some groceries. They started
back home about four o'clock in the
afternoon, each carrying a load of the
purchases they had made. Mr. Ros
holt, the storekeeper, advised them
to remain there until the storm abat
but they thought they could make
ed, but they thought they could make
it back without any trouble, as there
were three houses between the store
and the Benedick claim where they
could stop for shelter. However,
they lost their way in the storm and
missed all the houses, and, unable to
find shelter on the open prairie, per
ished from cold and exposure.
Mrs. Benedick was not worried for
a couple of days, and, as there were
no men in the house, both her hus
band and two sons being held by the
county authorities at Glasgow, she
was unable to even send word to the
neighbors that the men were miss
ing, until Wednesday.
A search was made and the bodies
were found, the body of Tom Bene
dick being discovered about a mile
and a half from the Benedick place.
The little fellow had apparently lost
this direction and was going away
from of toward „ home when
finally too exhausted to go any
further, he dropped in the snow for
his last sleep t ^
Hunjak was found by his sister
about a mile nearer home. He still
had the parcels of groceries in his
arms when he gave up the terrible
struggle against the blizzard, only a
half-mile from the house.
Alex Hunjak was about 40 years

left to mourn his loss. j

titles by purchase from "Andy" Tor
gerson, who left last week for the
west. While "Blyck" knows more
about selling knot-holes than rolling
- « yet he hopes by the patron
1 of the (ila8Jf0W smokers to build
up the local factory until some day
it will be housed under a three-story
shack with big plate glass windows
all around, and with the words Pn

W. F. Shoecraft will be "Blyck's"
foreman and "Shoey" will undoubted
ly be able to handle the force of men
under him, composed of "Shorty."
When it comes to taking some leaves
of the Havana plant and dexterously
entwining them into slender cylindri
cal shapes for the edification of the
"particular ones," who like to spend
a half-hour in Havana, "Shoey" is
there, and with "Shorty" to hold him
down and assist him with calm judg
ment, "Blyck" invites every local
smoker to try one of the new "La
Medallas." They're certainly "la
las," and whenever you buy one of
these cigars you're boosting Glasgow.
Not wishing "Blyck" any bad luck,
we hope that hell get so much busi
ness that itIL keep "Shoey" working
32 hours a day to fill the orders of
one customer. Here's Ho, "Blyck."
FAIR DATE SET.
At a special meeting of the board
of directors of the Valley County
Fair association, held yesterday, the
dates for the 1916 fair were set for
Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Sep
tember 14, 15 and 16. By having the
fair on these dates it will give the
farmers plenty of time to get their
exhibits ready and at the same time
give the fair board an opportunity
to get ready for the State fair. The
racing program for this year's fair
will be even better than last year and
a daredevil aeronaut will be hired to
make flights during the three days.
CHINOOK CAUSES
FLOOD AT HAVRE
Bull
Banks
Hook Creek Overflows
—Property Damaged.
The Chinook winds which visited
this section the first of the week and
melted the snow which lay to the
depth of two feet on the level, caused
Bull Hook creek at Havre to over
flow its banks and part of the Gas
city is now under water.
The flood waters came down with a
rush Tuesday afternoon, and so un
expected was it that the children in
the schools on the south side were
marooned and wagons and automo
biles were pressed into service to iake
them to their homes.
The city pumping station was flood
ed and put out of commission and the
water plant cannot be operated, leav
ing the citizens out of water for do
mestic use.
A gas shortage was reported, due
to the breaking of a gas main and
coal could not be brought in front th«
mines near the city because of the
high water. As a result many people
are without fuel of any kind. All the
families that remained on the south
side Tuesday night were removed to
the downtown hotels by automobiles
j and wagons.
j Many of the houses in the Hooded
j district are standing in three feet of
j water and the people of the city ex
press fears that if the ice in the Milk
river breaks up and causes an ice
j blockade the flood may grow much
worse.
An idea of how rapidly the waters
rose can be ascertained when it was
learned that the water rose four and
a half feet in a period of a little
more than three hours.
The damage from the flood cannot
be estimated, but it amounts to sev
eral thousand dollars.
