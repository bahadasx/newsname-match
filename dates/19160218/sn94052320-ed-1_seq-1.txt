Chicago "I do not wish to create a
panic In Chicago," waa the cryptic
reply of First Deputy Superintendent
of Police Schuettler, when asked Mon
day to live bia viewa of th plot to
poiaon several hundred prominent Chi
caroan.
Schuettler spoke testily and In the
too of a man who ia harboring th
secret of a arrest calamity. At tha
earn time he refused to admit that he
believed Jean Crone, missing assist-
ant chef at th University Club, who
eerved th banquet, wa th only man
who figured In th plot.
Two hundred of th dlaunguiaaaa
list of 400 banqueter who attended a
dinner given to Chicago new lawoue
archbishop. Moat Keverend beorg
William Munderlein, were taken III or
poisoning after th aoup coarse. Th
archbishop did not partak of th aoup,
nor did Governor Dunn, who waa
among those present.
Indications ar that ScttiMtuar t
hot on Crone' trail and ia gathering
evidence of a plot io which Crone waa
only wilt among a gang of anarchists
who planned to kill th distinguished
group of men. This waa born out by
the activities of bia atsuT of detec
tive.
Two hours before Health Commis
sioner Robertson gave out th report
of F. O. Tonney. city chemist, that
8.7 arraina of white oxida of ananie
had bean found In an analysis of
pint of th poisoned aoup aerved at tn
banouet, two anarchist were taken
Into Scboettler'a office.
Both of th anarchists were quea-
tioned for more than an hour. .When
they had gone Schuettler, in an inter
view, adrrrkted ha bad report on
Crone for several month. Ha knows
th aaawtinn Cronee ha attended,
what h aaid at those gatherings. He
admitted Crone waa a red hot "dyed-
in-the-wool" anarchist, that n knew
Cronee' aaalociatea, that hia detective
hav questioned thee men.
Schuettler made known in ran mat
Crone at meetnig of anarchists last
May asked tha speaker if hi study of
chemistry he is an amateur chemist
would injur hi standing in tha an
archist movement. Th speaker' re
ply throws soms light on th motive
of th poiaon plot It waa this:
"No, a chemist, could do great
deal In the anarchist movement."
