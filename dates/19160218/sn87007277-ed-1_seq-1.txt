London. Alexandra palace. Eng
land's largest single Internment camp
for civilian prisoners of war, corre
sponding to Germany's Ruhleben, near
Berlin, is the fascinating Interesting
British military city I was permitted
to visit today. No other press repre
sentatives were there; and this is the
first time a press man has been per
mitted to enter this camp.
More thai 3,000 enemy aliens, rich
and poor, from all parts of the world,
are living at Alexandra palace, North
London. Hundreds of Croats and
Poles from Pittsburgh and Detroit,
captured on their way home to ngnt;
well-known European musical artists,
interned while performing in England;
Germans and Austrians taken; from
ships in the Atlantic and the North
sea. and Austro-German directors of
big British firms, together with alien
inhabitants of England, some of 30
years' residence, make a unique and
remarkable colony for the duration
of the war.
There is no social distinction in the
three battalions of a thousand men

worker alike. A company of British
soldiers guards tho palace, which in
peace time serves as a London Coney

and does what he can.
Twice weekly the commandant per
sonally Inspects every one of the 2,000
beds housed under the great roofs of
the palace. These beds are neat and
clean, with four blankets and a soft
mattress for each.
There are olgL. cooks for every
thousand prisoners. The food Is pre
pared and taken to three great mess
rooms, each of which can compare
In floor space to the main lobby of
New Yorlt'a Grand Central station.
Here is the food allowance, per man
per day: One and one-half pounds of
white bread, one-half pound of meat,
one-half pound of potatoes, two ounces
of peas, lentils, beans or rice; two
ounces of sugar, one-half ounce of tea
or two ounces of coffee, one ounce of
margarine or two ounces of cheese,
tinned milk, salt and pepper. There
Is afternoon tea with bread and but
ter. Each battalion has a large canteen
where a prisoner may augment his
fobd supply. The wealthier internes
freely patronize the canteens, but the
ordinary fare is better than the av
erage Pittsburgh steel worker ever,
had In his life. These Plttsburghers
aren't anxious for the war to close.
They're satisfied.
The American embassy, godfather of
all enemy aliens in the British isles,
works hand in hand with a special
committee of the wealthier interned
men to care for the special wants of
the poor.
Almost every prisoner looks for
ward eagerly to the weekly theater.
Here artists, some high in the pro
fession, perform vaudeville stunts.
Professional actors present the latest
plays. The theater will seat 1,500
persons. The scenery was painted by
artists who rank high Im British and
German art circles, and Is Infinitely
better than that found in the average
London playhouse. '
A smaller hail, for 500 persons, Is
set aside for the evening musicals.
This hall is always crowded. At a
night concert Herr P. Lorant, an
Austrian violinist, who will be heard
In America after the war, was the star

Jack Coombs of Brooklyn Dodgers,
Says Game Helps Ball Player
In Securing Control.
"I cannot agree with these men
who say golf is bad for a ball player,"
says Jack Coombs of the Brooklyn
Dodgers. "It helps him more than
an ordinary man realizes. One of the
greatest assets of the game Is abso
lute control of oneself, in which
confidence plays an Important part.
Thus, the mind being under control,
one thinks of the Importance resting
upon him. There only Is one thought
succeed.
"It is true the swing in golf is far
different from that used in baseball.
There are few ball players, however,
who do not bring that stroke ot their
profession into golf. If you will look
back to the games I pitched for the
Athletics on Mondays, you will notice
from the box scores that my batting
was far superior to that on other
