GIRL LEPER BATTLES
FOR NEW LIFE
Authorities Experiment to Save Her Lepers Not
Isolated Until Disease Is Far Advanced Ride
in Street Cars and On "L" Trains.
' BY IDAH McGLONE GIBSON
New York, Feb. 18. I have seen
and talked to a 17-year-old girl af
flicted with leprosy, that 'ancient dis
ease supposed to be the curse of God.
Magellen McLean, isolated in a
room at the Hudson County (N. J.)
Hospital for Contagious Diseases, has
leprosy in its advanced stages.
When I entered the room I saw,
huddled in an arm chair next to the
radiator between the .two windows,
a slight form whose face was buried
in a book.
"Magellen; I have brought a friend
of mine to see you," said Supt Mc
Donough. Instantly the girl arose and smiled
yes, with full knowledge of her
condition she could still smile. The
ravages of her disease had begun to
show in her face, which quickly set
tled back into a wistful questioning.
"What are you reading?" I aslted.
"A romantic novel, all about kings
and conspiracies."
"Do you read your bible?" asked'
the superintendent. "Do you like to
teadit?"
