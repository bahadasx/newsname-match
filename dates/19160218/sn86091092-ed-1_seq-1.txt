LINCOLN DAY BANQUET
GREAT SUCCESS IN
ALL RESPECTS
REPUBLICANS OF IDAHO ARE
MORE HARMONIUS, UNITED
AND ENTHUSIASTIC THAN
IN MANY YEARS.
Candidates Failed to Materialize at
Boise Gathering—Speakers Did
Themselves Proud—Col. Thos. R.
Hamer Splendid Toastmaster —At
tendance Greater than Expected.
(Special to Caldwell Tribune.)
Boise, Feb. 16.—The Lincoln Day
gathering of Republicans at Boise was
an event full of significance. The old
time vim of the party was in evidence
on every hand—a vim that used to
spell victory and will spell victory
again in this year of 1916. The at
tendance was much larger than was
anticipated. The committee made ar
rangements for 175 guests but when
the hour arrived there were 300 to be
seated at the banquet tables, taxing
the capacity of the Owyhee to ac
comodate the throng. Many others
were prevented from being present
owing to the conditions of travel, and
particularly was this true with refer
ence to representatives from the
north. Only those who left their
northern homes several days in ad
vance were able to reach Boise for
the occasion.
The Lincoln Day gathering at Boise
had been looked forward to this year
as an event of great importance to
the Republican party and it was re
gretted that the north did not have its
full representation. It was to be an
occasion for consultation as well as
a reunion. It was expected that some
concentration of sentiment might de
velope relative to candidates, but the
absence of a more complete represen
tation from the north admitted of lit
tle progress along this line.
Borah for President
For the first time in many years
there seemed to be complete accord
in the ranks of the Republican party
and there was not a discordant note
sounded during the entire program of
oratory. President Frank Wyman of
the Lincoln Dav Association, a man of
strong progressive tendencies, selected
and introduced Col. Thomas R. Hamer
equally well-known for his stand-pat
Republicanism, as the toastmaster of
the evening. There was no suppressed
anxiety that any speaker might over
step the bounds of propriety and say
something that would bring up un
pleasant memories of 1912. It was
a Republican meeting. The mention
of the name of Borah for president al
ways brought cheers .and showed un
bounded enthusiasm for Idaho's great
senator. There was no mistaking the
feelings of the Republicans of this
state toward Borah—a feeling of pride
in the commanding position that he
has attained in the national councils
of his party and a hope that his great
talents may result in his nomination
and election to the presidency.
Candidates for Governor.
While it is in no wise the province
of a Lincoln Dav gathering to name
candidates, it was expectcd that some
headway would be made in at least
finding out who was who in that in
teresting and many sided contest, the
fight for the gubernatorial nomina
tion. Those who entertained such ex
pectations were doomed to disappoint
ment as little or no headway was made
along that line.
Especial interest seemed to center
around the candidacies of E. H. Dewcv
and George Crum. It was observed
that both men had many friends in
common, friends who would be satis
tied with either but who would dis
like to see the one arrayed against
the other. Neither of these men have
yet announced 'heir candidacies.
Dewey authorized an interview last
fall in which he declared himself out
of the race but since that time there
has been a great pressure brought to
bear to have him reconsider his decis
ion and the Canyon county man has
been almost persuaded, although Iiis
announcement was not forthcoming as
a result of conferences held on Lin
coln Day. It is understood that either
Crum or Dewey will announce his
candidacy in a very few days, but that
both will enter the ranee is not al all
likely.
The southeastern representatives
were divided between Dewey and D
W. Davis, with George E. Crum as a
second choice among the Dewey ad
vocates. It was noted that some of
the men who attended the famous
Pocatello conference last fall and
agreed upon D. W. Davis were not
adhering to the agreement which was
giving the Davis people some con
cern. Davis was not without numer
«us advocates around the hotel lob
bies, however. Capt. Davis aopeared
to be playing a lone hand, but this is
not especially significant in view of
the fact that he opposes conferences
and combinations and proposes to take
his case direct to the people. Goyer
nor Haines was spoken of ver • kind
ly on all sides and it was reajized that
there was no telling where lightening
might strike in view of the great num
ber of candidates now in evidence. The
intentions of Lieutenant Governor
Taylor were frequently inciuired after
but nothing was learned beyond lus
previous declaration that he would be
a candidate. ,
A most favorable and significant
sentiment seemed to prevail on all
sides and that was a determination to
nominate a strong, clean ticket, one
that would merit and receive the un
ited support of a reunited party. 1"
this determination results in an ac
complished fact next September, the
rçsult can easily be foretold when it
is remembered that the normal Re
publican majority in Idaho is esti
mated to be 15,000.
The great success of the Lincoln
Day banquet, not only in the number
in attendance, but in the enthusiasm
displayed, is regarded as a favorable
omen for Republican success in Idaho.
FARMERS* SOCIETY OF EQUITY
OPENS CALDWELL BRANCH
R. A. Johnson May Have Charge of
Caldwell Branch of Society
R. A. Johnson, formerly of Caldwell,
now located at Nampa, was in the
city Thursday. Mr. Johnson is em
ployed by the Farmers' Society of
'quity at the Nampa branch.
Mr. Johnson states that the So
ciety will open a branch in Caldwell at
once. The building formerly used by
the Caldwell Water Lifter Co., on
Seventh street across the O. S. L., has
been leased. Mr. Johnson will es
tablish the business and may remain
in charge as local manager. The So
cjety will handle implements, ve
hicles of all kinds, seeds, hogs and
other products used and produced by
the farmers.
Mr. Johnson states that there are
15 locals in Canyon county. Last year
the Society did business to the amount
of $140,000.00 at Nampa. He thinks
that Caldwell will do as much busi
ness this year.
Birthday Dinner Party.
o
Mrs. Ada F. Riddle reached another
milestone on the journey of life Wed
nesday, the 16th inst. Her daughter,
Miss Louise assisted by the young
women who are accustomed to meet
two or three times a day around the
table of Mrs. Stauber, conspired to
make it a memorable event. A few
other friends were invited to join In
dispatching the excellent birthday
dinner provided by Mrs. Stauber, who
delights to humor her boarders and
who always sets before them the best
cooked and the best planned of meals.
The first notification the honored
guest received was upon opening the
door of the dining room to find it
lighted only by the sixteen little pink
candles, which decorated the birthday
cake in the center of the table, In
token of the fact that a woman is al
ways "sweet sixteen." A bunch of
fragrant and beautiful flowers mark
er place at the table. After the din
ner the party adjourned to the home
of the Riddles and an enjoyable even
ing was spent. Such bright spots In
life are long remembered not only by
the recepient alone, but by the donors
as well.
Mr. Severn Likes Idaho Best.
Mr. Severn of Boise visited with a
number of his friends here Sunday.
Mr. Severn is one one who likes the
climate of Idaho so well that he pre
fers to live here rather than in the
east. He has reached the age when
he does not care to enter uoon any un
dertaking for himself but he says It
he were a young man he thinks he
could succeed on a ranch here. He
has some sons who are successful
business men in New York, who urge
him to make his home with them, but
he prefers Idaho. He went east about
three years ago thinking to remain,
but after a year or so returned to
Idaho. One of his sons has just gone
to South America to superintend the
introduction of machinery from the
United States into Argentina. Mr.
Severn was accompanied to Caldwell
by little William Biddle.
Trying Out Montessori System.
Miss Cordelia Farrer is introducing
the Montessori system of teaching,
limited by circumstances, and a par
tial supply of necessary apparatus. It
is an experimental attempt to raise
the proficiency of backward pupils of
the first grade through the sense of
touch in addition to that of sight and
hearing. The Montessori method Is
being introduced into many or the pub.
lie schools throughout this country. It
tends to develop originality of thought
and action. A guiding of head and
heart as well as of hands and feet Is
aimed at, and a freedom from restraint
which many think strikes at the ef
ficiency of our present public school
system.
Tea For Mountain Home Teachers.
The visiting teachers from Moun
tain Home were given « farewell tea
bv Miss Burns at her hor».e at the
residence of Dr. and Mrs. Farrer os
the bolevard, Sunday afternoon. There
were persent the Misses Buchanan,
Watts and Charlotte Steeleman from
Mountain Home, and Misses Steele
man, Reed, Farrer, Mrs. Miller and
Mrs. Farrer. A few musical selections
rendered on the piano by Miss Uldine
Garten were an addition to the pleasure
of the occasion. Several of the guests
accompanied the visiting teachers to
their train immediately after the party,
Mrs. Ruby and Mrs. Shelby have
made arrangements for the placement
of trapeze, swings and teeter boards
at the Washington school house.

TURNER FINDS CALIFOR
NIA READY FOR REVIV
AL IN BUSINESS
CROSS RAILWAY INTERSECT
ING SOUTHERN PACIFIC AT
SOUTH IS VERY BADLY
NEEDED.
Former Mayor Finds Republican
Party United on the Co*st—Hughes
is Great Favorite—Root and Burton
Have Friends— Taft and Roosevelt
Are in the Discard.
Former Mayor C. H. Turner, one
of the leading horse and mule dealers
of the northwest, has just returned
from a four weeks' trip through Cal
ifornia. He visited San Francisco,
Oakland, Santa Rosa, and Los Banos,
where he purchased horses for the
Allies, turning them over to their
agent at Ogden, Utah.
_ Mr. Turner states that he was in
sight of snow every day he was in
California. On the summit between
Sacramento and Reno there are 20
feet of snow. The Secramento Valley
wag practically a lake of water. The
winter wheat has been badly damaged.
Outlook Hopeful.
"Business men seem hopeful of a
revival jn business," continued Mr.
Turner. "The indications are that
they have had their portion of busi
ness depression. A revival in all in
dustries may be looked forward to this
coming year. In fact it has already
started.
"California has many fine features
but for a man of modest means I
think the chances are two to one in
his favor in Idaho. Here the soil is in
its youth and vigor, the climate is
just as good, and opportunity awaits
every one who has the energy and in
dustry to try.
"The interests of both states could
be greatly facilitated by a cross rail
road from the Boise Valley intersect
ing the Southern Pacific at a point
south. The present roundabout line
of transportation almost prohibits
commerce between the two sections.
The present freight rates to Missouri
River points are one-third less than
to San Francisco, and the distance by
xross railroad would be one-third less.
Untarnished Material Wanted.
"I found the people talking politics
to more or less extent. It was all
Republican politics. The candidate of
the Republican party is the question of
supreme interest. The general im
jression, as I received it, was that the
Republicans should this year unite
on some untarnished new material for
the ticket. A man who has not been
too closely mixed up in the fight of
1912 is needed. Neither Taft nor
Roosevelt should be considered. A
man like Justice Hughes would be the
ideal leader. Senator Root has a
reat many friends and admirers,
enator Burton is a favorite in some
quarters. Any new man of strength
will fill the bill.
"The Republicans of the west are
ready to unite in order to restore
prosperity, dignity and security."
Mr. Turner was accompanied home
by his son, Lee Turner, who has been
in California for several months. He
state« that he had a pleasant trip and
secured a great many horses for the
Allies.

DU COLE HINDUNGES
RMSEEFCIROIDIIt
FOR H
POPULAR CITIZEN RESPONDS
TO DEMANDS OF FRIENDS
THROUGHOUT COUNTY
THAT HE WILL RUN.
Details of Views and Platform Will
be Given the Public Later in Cam
Saign—Dr. Cole is One of the Best
len in the Community in Every
Respect—Should be Elected.
Dr. F. M. Cole, one of the leading
physicians of this city, and a man
active in the social, commercial and
civic affairs of Caldwell, announces
that he will be a candidate for the Re
publican nomination for state sena
tor. Dr. Cole is one of our most pub
lic spirited citizens and a man of great
force of character. If elected he will
prove one of the best and most effici
ent men Canyon county has ever sent
to the state legislature.
It is expected that Dr. Cole will
have the practically unanimous sup
port of Caldwell and tributary terri
tory. He has become a candidate at
the solicitation of the business and
professional men of Caldwell and or
the farmers living near this city.
While his election will necessarily
mean a loss financially Dr. Cole has
consented to become a candidate.
Later Dr. Cole will announce defi
nitely and specifically his position on
every issue with which he will have to
deal as a member of the legislature.
He will also make knowh the things
he will try to accomplish for Caldwell,
Canyon county and Idaho. He be
lieves that the people have a right to
know exactly where he stands and is
perfectly willing that they should
enow.
The announcement is not made with
a view of starting a' campaign at this
time but simply that the people of
the county may know that he will be
candidate. In due time Dr. Cole
will give out all information concern
ing his candidacy and purposes.
Statement of Candidacy
Dr. Cole stated yesterday, in re
sponse to an inquiry from The Tri
bune. as to his candidacy:
"I have decided to become a candi
date for the Republican nomination
for state senator subject to the action
of the Republicans of Canyon county
at the August primary election. I
have been urged to become a candi
date by a great many friends in dif
ferent parts of the county, friends in
whose judgment I have the utmost
confidence. I have received pledges
of support from a great many. All of
this is highly gratifying.
"I believe that every citizen is In
duty bound to do his share of the
public work. While the state senator
ship is a great honor I do not believe
that any one can accuse me of selfish
ness nor ulterior purposes in becoming
a candidate for this office. I have a
few ideas on matters of legislation
which I believe will, if enacted into
law, be of the greatest benefit to the
public I shall do my utmost to look
after the legitimate interests of my
constituents.
"At a later date I will give the pub
lic my views on all issues which can
come before me if elected."
OAKES BROS. HAVE
NOVEL WINDOW DISPLAY
Oakes Bros, have a novel display in
their windows this week. To one leg
a pair of trousers is suspended a keg
of nails weighing 108 pounds—a con
siderable test to prove the anti-rip
ping qualities of this particular brand
of pants. One rip brings in the pos
sessor one dollar, a button coming off
will net ten cents, etc.—all guaran
teed.
Receive Palmer Buttons
Eleven pupils of the Washington
school received the Palmer buttons
that arc sent out by the A. N. Palmer

ADVANCE WATER PAYMENT
PLAN IS RESCINDED
Reclamation Commission Hastily Re
calls Objectionable Mandate.
Settlers on government projects will
not be required to pay their water
charges in advancc this season as was
recently ordered by the reclamation
commission. The order to this ef
fect has been rescinded.
The new ruling, which was sent out
in the form of a circular letter to
which Comptroller Rryan's signature
was attached, drew forth vehemcnent
protest at the February meeting of di
rectors of the Payette-Boise Water
Users' association. Resolutions con
demning the advance payment plan
and ordering a protest sent at once to
headquarters by night letter, were
passed.
Protest Wired In.
Over the names of President Keim
and Secretary Girard of the associa
tion the text of the resolution was
forwarded by wire to Washington.
Since Comptroller Ryan's name was
attached to the circular, criticism of
the plan was in a measure directed at
him. -From the answer received it
now seems that he was not to blame
any more than other members of the
commission.
It now appears that the order was
considered ill-advised and rescinded,
even before the protest from the
Boise project was received in Wash
ington.
Advance Payment Dropped.
In reply to the message sent from
here Secretary Girard is now in re
ceipt of a telegram from First Assis
tant Secretary of the Interior Jones.
This reply reads as follows:
"Circular 533, issued by authority
of all members of the reclamation
commission, was amended February 5,
eliminating provision for advance pay
ment water service charges."
This news will be received with re
joicing by settlers on the project,
many of whom saw a serious condi
tion facing them, were it necessary to
pay water charges twice within a
period of five months.
