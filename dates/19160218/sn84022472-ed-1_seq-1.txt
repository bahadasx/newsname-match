FRANK INVENTS s
HYDRANT DEVICE
TO THA PIPES
Revolutionary Method For
Use In Fire Departments
Discovered Here.
Chief Edward Mo ran of the Hart
ford fire department, visited Bridge
port yesterday to inspect a device for
thawing out fire hydrants constructed
by a Bridgeport fireman, which may
revolutionize the pumping systems of
departments throughout the country. '
Walter F.-' Frank, engineer on 'No.
2 steamer, living at 848 Noble avenue,
is the fireman whose genius has made
the gasoline pumping cftigines practi
cable for use where hydrants are
frozen. - . .
He has devised a flexible steel hose
connection for use with the engine
exhaust which is said by the experts
who heave looked at its operation to
far excel tha. pteam apparatus in the
work of thawing frozen street hy
drants. Because of the lack of this equip
ment the gasoline pumping engines
have heretofore been of questionable
use In cold weather.' " It is said that
New York city' had refused to enter
tain their use for - this reason and
Hartford was undecided as to their
merits.-. Having heard of the applica
tion used in Bridgeport, chiefs 'from
all sections of New England have
taken notice and are investigating
here. "

that when the accused are finally

ESS OF
IN T
There was not even a laundry mark
to aid the police.;
With this slender clue. Inspector
Faurot took personal charge of the
case and on Sept. 14, 1913, 12 days
after the murder, Hans Schmidt, ,an
assistant priest at an uptown church;
was arrested, charged with the crime.
An . hour before the arrest the in.
soector had broken into a flat and
found a long-bladed -butcher's knife
and other evidence that the murder
had been committed .there. Schmidt
confessed and his sole defense was
that it was a "blood sacrifice murder."
" The ' body -had been dismembered
and presumably all of it was thrown
into the river, although the head was
never found.; Schmidt was twice plac
ed on trial, the first jury, in Decem
ber, J913, failing to reach a verdict.
In 1914, he was found guilty.
Besides the,- sordid story of Anna
A.umuller's infatuation for Schmidt,
the. trials revealed that his was a -career
of crime. He was engagedxih a
counterfeiting scheme the day the
crime was committed, it was stated,
and "Dr." Amurt, . who posed as a
dentist, was sent to prison for seven
years as Schmidt's accomplice in the
latter's scheme. It was found that
Schmidt- also had posed vas a physi
cian, that he had committed forgery
on numerous"1 occasions and that " he
had been guilty of various other acta
of fraud. "
. His attorneys . pleaded their client
was insane. The slayer, however, al
ways contended that , he was sane. He
took no active part in his own defense,
When he was convicted? he thanked
the court and expressed a desire to
be executed at once. .

Fire losses in Bridgeport are result

alarmed and the most drastic enforce

.State Factory .Inspector John R.
Doughan arrived in this city today and
investigations,, the v nature of which is
not disclosed are being made. It is
likely that he. will demand elevator

absolutely free from, refuse. - Small
quantities of paper, rags, and like
waste has recently been discovered in
the elevator pits of several factories
here. ' ' ' ,.'
Capt. Thomas J.- Broderick, Inspector

still remains a mystery to the , steel

THREATEN TO CALL
GENERAL STRIKE
What's to Be Done Depends
Upon Developments of
New Litigation.
A strike among the machinists in

ed, if developments in the ' disagree
ment with the Max Ams Machine Co.
warrant the, step, according to George
J. Bowen, business agent of the In
ternational Association of Machinists,
local, No. 30. '
"We'll call a general strike, if neces
sary," said. Mr. Bowen, today. "The
Manufacturers' association is backing
the Max Ams Co. in this matter. They
are advertising ' for machinists and
when they , get them they send them
to the Max Ams Co.
"If we are pressed, we'll call out
every man in the city.
"All this shows that it is" time la
bor men entered the field of politics
to obtain what we think are our
rights. . If things have come to the
pass where manufacturers can re
strain, labor men from doing what ia
legal, and may be punished on the
allegation that they did that which it
is manifestly impossible for - them to
do, and which is fllegal anyway, it is
time we entered the game of obtaining
things -by politics." K
i The allegations of the plaintiffs are
ridiculous, according .to Mr. Bowen.
He says the machinists', pickets are
charged with doing things which they
cannot do; because policemen and
guards are there to see that they do
not.
The Machinists local sent in a call
to the general executive board at
Washington today, for Frank J.- Mul

will- come here if the conditions ap

STRIKERS SEND
PROPOSALS TOv
REMINGTON GO,
Settlement of Drop Forgets
and Die Workers Trouble
Seems Likely.-
The first step looking toward a set
tlement of the strike of the l drop
forgers and die sinkers at the Reming
ton Arms & Ammunition ; Co. was,
taken this afternoon when the strikers
sent a messenger to the company of
ficials saying that the workman are
ready to meet the officials for a dis
cussion of ah adjustment.
Acscording to the strikers, certain
requests will be made of the officials
and if they are granted, tle men will
return to work. , . ' . -,'-.
A settlement seems not far off be
cause of the. attitude of the pVsons
at odds. The company's officials
statement today said. "We are pleas
ed " at the disposition of the strikers
shown in their statement which was
printed yesterday in. The Farmer The
tone of the statement indicated $hat
good feeling prevails."
Both sides persisted today on "their
contention concerning the charges.
The strikers again denied that the
company had made an offer to charge
only half the cost of the material to
the men, after it had been spoiled.
On this matter, the following was is
sued from the company office today:
"This offer positively was made, but
the men wcjuldn't wait for the shop
order puttting it into effect. The offer
was made the same day the demands
were presented the company by the
men.
"We are at a . loss to . understand
why the men walked out so precipi
tately. . We maintain an expensive
Welfare Bureau forthe men and are
doing everything ' to adjust matters
such as these. .Sometimes a foreman
may discharge a man. The workers
have their grievance committee that
can rfiort to Joseph Page, head- of
the Welfare Bureau. " ) -
sje "will investigate and then take
lip the matter with the officials of the
plant. If the foreman was wrong, the
discharged man will be reinstated
"All other grievances may hp ad
justed this way, but the men doSi't
seem to take advantage of them. Regarding-
the complaint about the con
dition of the floor, these things are al
ways remedied. You can't prevent
accidents. We have a man who spends
all his time Inventing and installing
safety devices to prevent injury to the
men, but. they won't take advantage
of them. For instance, in the grind
ing room, we ruled that all must wear
goggles to safeguard their eyes
against the dust. Then t7iey are not

throng seemed to view yester
day's rush through the wire ,
and copper mills of the - An
sonia Brass & popper Company
and -Jhe, Brass mill, of the Coe
Brass Company, as a Kuge; di-.
version with its himorous as
pects in, high relief.
Tie strikers' did no parading
this morning; and congregating
on the city's streets bad no dis
agreeable features;
No person was actually, injured In i
yesterday's rush , arid tne property!
damage, sifted down to a definite ba-,
sis, was trifling,' chiefly to doors in ,
the mills which the crowd bore down
with as much eagerness as a football j
backfield shows in hitting the line of!
its opponents. Knots of strikers were
in happy mood and while their lan
guage was not intelligible to many
others the gesticulations and roars of
laughter seemed to indicate that in
dividuals were relating their experi
ences, i It is estimated that twenty ;
different tongues or dialects are
spoken among the strikers who for ;
the larger , part are what is termed
unskilled labor. ' V,." ;
Mayor Schumacher said - he would ;
probably, order saloons jio . cross; ua;
til further notice as a precautionarlt
measure., i He had a , conferences." with
the of ficers .of the brass company and
afterwards said that he" had asked i
High Sheriff Hugo, of New Haven, if j
he could have Troop A sent here, not ;
because the troop was needed at this
time but to have it in reserve in "case j
there was a fight. He thought tho
troopers ',could reinforce his special! ;
officers and control ' any situation I
which ' might," arise. 1 . ' j
Word came here that a message i
had been sent to Captain Wolf, of j
Troop A, to warn his men to be ready i
in case orders were issued for strike j
duty. . Adjutant General George M. i
Cole, who gave a. personal message to
Captain Wolf, says that no orders have I
been issued for the cavalry. At the j
armory it was stated that no orders ;
had been received to march, but May- ;
or Schumacher was " under the im-
pression at noon that the troop would)1
be here later in the day.
- The strikers held mass meetings
during the morning when committees i
were named to present demands ,to
the mill officials.. The demands were :
not all the same 'and it was s evident '
that many of the strikers had not ;
decided just -what they--wanted. ..:
The chief concern Is felt by the
police over - the demand of a few '
strikers that an effort .be made to call
out or take out, 1.25 men employed:
by the-. Farrell Foundry since the
moulders' strike there last summer-.
These men are housed and fed ori
the premises. The' foundry is also
guarded and it is understood that the
crowd, if it attempted to make at rush
there Would meet with resistance.
The High School Glee club was to
have given a concert tonight but Rich
ard Tobin, the schobl superintendent,'
postponed the affair as he did not
think it best to have the students
on the streets tonigit. ."".'".
