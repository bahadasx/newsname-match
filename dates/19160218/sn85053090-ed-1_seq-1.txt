THE FIREMEN'S BALL
To be Held Tuesday Evening
at The Play House
Now for the Firemen's Semi
annual ball. Of course you will
attend if there is any possible
chance to do so, but, by the wav,
isn't there a friend or neighbor
of yours who may have overlook
ed this opportunity, and especi
ally the date, to have one of the
best times of the season and
more so to help us dedicate the
Play House which has been se
cured for the occasion. Ekalaka
property owners should each pur
chase a ticket, regardless of
whether they dance or not. The
fire department is not a paid or
ganization, all services possible
for them to render always come
free and for them to meet their
necessary monthly expenses is
the only reason for their giving
these semi-annual social dances.
The real active ticket selling
campaign will commence Satur
day, all members of the depart
ment having a few for sale. Buy
one and he'p the boys, then if
you dance come out next Tuesday
evening at the Play House and
enjoy yourself. Elliott's five
piece orchestra will furnish the
music, and as for the floor, leave
it to the hall managers—they've
got the best ever.
Roller Skating.
The Amusement company op
ened up the "Play House" last
Saturday to the public, the eve
ning being enjoyed by many at
roller skating. During the week
special hours have been devoted
to the ladies and children and
also to the "brones" for practice.
r l he skating fad is taking well
and affords much exercise and
amusement. So far R. V. Fuqua
carries all medals for floor clean
ing and no doubt a number of
slightly colored remembrance
marks about his person. The first
evening to be devoted to dancing
will be next Tuesday, when the
firemen have their dance. The
balancOof the electric lighting
apparatus and machines for the
moving pictures are on the way
and should arrive any day.
Woodrow Wilson a Candidate
That President Wilson will be
come a candidate to succeed him
self in office was officially an
of the 14th inst. The president
made known his position in order
to comply with the Ohio primary
law which requires candidates

that candidates for delegates,

The president's announcement
says:- '"While I am entirely un

Leading republicans have been
loss to ascertain who is at the
head of the procession but as we
understand their slogan will be
"to elect a republican to every
office from public administrator

we assume it might be a few of

While a number of towns in
the state, many of which are on
the railroads, have been com-'
plaining of food and fuel short-!
ages throughout the past severe
cold spell which extended practi
cally fu>m the first of the year,
until a week ago, no kick ' has
been registered in Ekalaka. For
a few merchants to carry through
the many people of this section,
forty-two miles from a railroad
through such a speil as we had
without noting any great short
age of fuel, groceries, oil or cold
weather clothing is no small un
dertaking, especially when one
consuieis that »or many days, in
fact weeks, the merchants were
unable to get freighters to the
railroad for supplies. We believe
that a good deal of credit is due
the Ekalaka merchants for their
foresight in this matter.
Frozen to Death.
On Friday, January 21st, the
body of Win. McCarthy was dis
covered in the Gus Aronson cab
in on the bank of the Big Powder
river about a mile from the
L>roadus bridge. As the story
reaches us McCarthy was last
seen on Wednesday, January
lUth, at the Broadus store and
, „„„
| was not seen again until Friday
! ^gated and gazed through the
| window at the body, and after
I discussing the matter it was de
when a homesteader who was
passing stopped at the Aronson
cabin found it locked, looked
.hrough the window and seen the
body lying on the floor, the newsj
rapidly spread and within a few
urs a number of men had con
eided to communicate with the
coroner, in Miles City, before
forcing the door. The coroner
was notified on Saturday, Janu
ary 22nd and up to Sunday, Jan-1
uary 30 no word had been receiv
ed from him concerning the mat
ter, and at that date the body of
the unfortunate man was still ly
ing in the same position on the
floor as when first discovered,

country last August and was em

been a sheep herder for a num
ber of years and that he walked
from Miles City to the Broadus
ployed on the Daut ranch for a
few weeks during haying, after
wards working for the B. P. Tel
ephone company. He appeared
to be a man in the neighborhood
of fifty years of age.
Much criticism of Custer coun
ty's coroner has been indulged in
by the residents of that section
c "" c e rnin £ his inactivity in this
matter. People look upon it as
an outrageous act upon his part
in not ordering the body attended 1
to instead of allowing eight days
to

lapse and the body still lying

Should the good weather con

D. D. Stanton returned [from
Baker yesterday where he had
been with a load of grain. He
reports the roads as being fierce,
no sledding and about as bad for
wagons.
Ben Hamilton failed to make it
"per schedule" Wednesday eve
ning, arriving about 10 p. m. The
cause of the delay was given as
high water and a tip-over near
the North ranch. Ben did not
make the trip with the mail yes
terday on account of the high
water, the several draws and
creeks on the road being over
flowed, which would do more ;
harm than good to cur daily mail
supply.
Fred Martens returned from
Baker Tuesday evening where he
had been with a load of grain. A
number of other grain haulers
left here Tuesday neon but after
reaching the Beaver creek bridge
and having heard a non-political
speech from Mr. Martens on the
conditions of the roads they un- >
loaded and pulled back to town.
It seems that sledding is a thing
of the past for some time, espec
ially until another heavy fall of
snow arrives which we hope is
not until next winter.
Jess Grant hands us the fol
lowing bit of news for this week's
issue: "There is going to be an
inspection of war horses in Eka- :
laka about the first of June and
it might be well to advise all
horsemen to get in their horses, j
get them halter broke and ready '
to show by that date. As to the
prices, weights, etc., this will be |
announced later. A combination
sale is also scheduled for March
11th at the sale yards of the Eka
laka sales company which prom
ises to be one of the largest to be
held this year.
As will be noticed elsewhere in
this issue on March 6th there is
to be held at Ekalaka an open
democratic mass meeting at
which time county, state and
national political issues will be,
discussed and plans made for the
coming campaigns. This will be
a rousing meeting and it is de
sired that the old guard turn out
en masse and assist the central
committee in getting all things,
lined up for the coming primar
ies and if you feel just a little
out of place in the attempted
amalgamation of the republican
and bull moose parties, come in
and join the followers of Wood
row Wilson in their discussion of
future activities. Remember
the date and place -at Ekalaka
on March 6th at 2:00 p. m.
