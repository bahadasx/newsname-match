London, Feb. 18. Following upon the capture of
Erzerum, Grand Duke Nicholas' Russian forces are aim

120 miles distant.
Already the Russian right wing is within 50 miles of

fall of Trebizond is expected within a fortnight.
While this new drive is on, an investigation of Turkish
atrocities in Armenia will begin immediately at Erzerum
and the extcution of Turkish officials responsible for
them is predicted.
The registration of prisoners and booty in Erzerum
has only begun, but it was revealed today that 25 more
guns and 1500 prisoners had been taken in the outer

Yet shipping circled were not

the infrequency of submarine attacks

German Admiral Von Tirpitz made

Word From England About

Washington, Feb, 18. With the sub
marine warfare negotiations between
the state department and German Am

rary standstill, the cabinet and senate
today debated the future course of this
government.
Nonpartisan congressional support
was promised for the administration

and Germany announcing their inten
tion to attack armed merchantmen
without warning. The cabinet was ex
pected to consider whether to protest
formally aguinst the German anil Aus
trian pronouncements, though it was
believed the government would decide
to await actual developments before
making such a move.
The delay of the allies in advising the
administration as to their course toward
the decrees is hampering the state de
partment negotiations with Berlin.
Though British Ambassador Sir Cecil
Spring-Rice promised a joint allied note
on the subject, this has not been forth
coming.
Independent of any position the allies
may assume, however, the administra
tion is committed to a demand that Ger
many shall pledge that her future sub
marine efforts sliull conform to the es
tablished international code.

bullet in his leg, but smilingly assured
officers that it was nil an accident.
Louie Quon was in jail. He cheerful

Louie Quon is a San Francisco member
of the consolidated Bow Leong tong.

Senator Lodge Insists Attack
ing Armed Merchantmen
Is Unlawful
Washington, Feb. IS. Austria and
Germany were charged by Senator
Lodge of Massachusetts today with pro
posing piracy in their plans to atteck
armed merchantmen without warning.
Discussing the Sterling resolution
against recognition of their plans,
ldge said it is inconceivable that tho
United States would accept the Teuton
ic decree. He cited precedents to show
that arming of ships tor defense nad
been allowed since the days of the Bar
bary pirates. He recalled that Amcrici
had approved such armament during the
present war and declared that any
change from this position now would bo
un unneutral act.
"The abandonment of the right of
merchantmen to arm themselves or the
right of Americans to travel or Bhip
their goods on them," said Lodge,
"could rest only on the ground that the
centuries-old right of neutrals must bo
cast aside so that a new instrument of
maritime destruction should out be im
peded in its work of death nnd mur
der. Such a doctrine is revolting to
everv instinct of humanity and to ev
ery principle of law and justice."
He said nb.indoiinieiit of the present
system would be a warlike step against
the allies, which at the same time
would make the United States Ger
nianv's allv.
Senator Sterling, who introduced the
resolution several days ago followed
Lodge.
Denouncing the Teuton decree a-s a
reversion to the ideas of the Dark
Ages and as creating a situation which
constitutes 'our gravest international
crisis," Sterling declared:
"Let another sea horror occur in
which Americans are involved nnd the
administration mid the world will know
Hint there is a real America, not supine,
not apathetic and hesitating, but strong
ami militant.
Referring to the Lusitania ease, Ster
ling snid that the administration "at
first appeared bold and uncompromising
in behalr of a great principle, but in
the end yielded the substnucc for the
wont."
"The vice in the stnte departments
suggestion that the nllies disurm mer
chantmen," snid Sterling, "lies in the
idea that because the deadly submarine
is not strong on defense itself, we must
muke merchantmen helpless against
it."
Mcrling urgeu issuance or a very
strong protest to Germany against her
new plans.
Following Lodge nnd Sterling, Sen
ator Thomas rend into the record ro
cent reports that the administration in
tends no approval of the decree, as tho
two previous speakers suggested. He
charged that the republican attacks
were for political effect and were not
based on facts or upon a sincere de
sire to better the diplomatic relations
ot the nation.
