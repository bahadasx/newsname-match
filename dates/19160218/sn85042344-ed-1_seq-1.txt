OUOLIIS have been given to clear
I he one hundred by ninety-foot
tract at the intersection of Kourtll
Mid Main streets, preparatory to the
erection ofa ten-story office and bus
iness building by K. I'. Harwell. This
work will reipiire only a few days,
after which the ground will be made
ready for assault at the hands of
hundreds of laborers and mechanics
who will install u foundation which
will be one of the deepest In the city
and capible of holding a structure of
even more thin ten stories.
All hour h plans for this superb
ilruciurc have not yet been completed
they lire understood now to he in tliu
hands of an architect wiio has orders
to make all haste, that actual oper
ations may begin at the earliest pos
sible date, which probably will bo
April 1. The building will have a
.Main strict frontage of u hundred
feet and extend along Kourth street
for a distance of ninety feet. Steel,
concrete, brick and cut stone will ho
used, making It absolutely fireproof.
Mr. Ilarwill has infinite confidence
in Tulsa's future, therefore will de
sign his new building in such a way
that substantial additions may lie
made any time. Therefore, when tho
city's progress necessitates more room
in the Ihn well building, it will lie pro
vided by taking the structure up as
many stories us necessary.
Mores n ml Off ices
i in the ground floor of this splen
did building, which will be situated
at the intersection of two of the most
important business thoroughfares, will
lie a group of the largest and best
store rooms In the city. They will
be faced with huge plate gluss win
dows which have become so necessary
in displaying merchandise, while spe
cial attention will be given by the
architects to ventilation and lighting.
The elevator corridor will be fin
inshed in solid marble while the ele
vator cages on the ground floor will
be heavy bronze in artistic scroll.
There probably will be four passenger
clevutois, but nt the rear of the build
ing will he two lifts designed for
handlinir heavy freight, furniture and
luggage. The elevator mechanism
will be of the latest Improved type
combining high speed with a mini
mum of daneer.
Kountains of running water will he
installed on all floors, while It Is not
improbable the roof will be used as a
summer garden. The ventilating, sani
tation and heating systems will insure
perfect comfort nnd health for all oc
cupants of the big structure.
If work on this building Is started
April 1, It should he completed within
eight months, which Insures the form
al opening in the early winter of this
year. . .
