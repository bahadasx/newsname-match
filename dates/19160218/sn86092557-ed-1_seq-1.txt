fully Revived.
JOHN CJON THE LOSER
Rode Into Town and Tied |
His Animal at the Usual
Place.
A return to the good old days in
this county Is Indicated by the revival
of the great outdoor sport of horse
stealing. A real old-fashioned "Hoss
Thief" visited Monongah last night,
and left with an excellent Enddle mare.
Neither hide nor hoof of either the
thief or the mare have as yet been
seen. The horse and rider passed away
into the darkness and fog and the
silence of the rainy night, and no one
noticed the way of their going.
John C. Koon, who lives a few miles
from Monongah, in Grant district,'
last night saddled up a bay mare be
longing to his father and. rode into
Monongah. John dismounted and hitch
ed the mare near the end o? the Booths
ville bridge, which is the usual hitch
ing place for horses in Monongah.
About 9 o'clock John went to the
hitching post to get bis mare, but she
was not there. The Monongah officials
were notified, but as yet no trace ot
the mare or thief has been found.

Feat of Russian Infantry-j
men One of War's
Wonders.
Petrograd, Feb. 18.?The fall of Er
zerum, the most Important Turkish
stronghold in Asia Minor, and for a
long time considered impregnable, of
fers an unprecedented spectacle of a
first-class fortress built on a steep
mountain ridge nearly a mile above
sea level, yielding to a bayonet attack
after only 3 hours bombardment. The
operations were conducted under the
most serere weather conditions, the
snow being deep and the thermometer
registering at times more than 30 de
grees below zero Fahrenheit.
The Turkish army defending Er-'
zerum, taken by surprise under the
method adopted by the Russians, Is
now said to be in disorderly flight on
the road leading to Slvas. As the
garrison, apparently is scattered In
air directions it is assumed here that
large numbers of men were taken pris
oners, although official figures are
lacking.
After the taking of NIskala It ap
pears that the Russian attack would
be directed upon the Turkish right
flank and by rapidly transferring
troops the Turks'made all plans to
resist-the main assault from this quar
ter. Apparently they had little fear
of success sOf this attack because of
the strong character of the fortifica
tions in that direction and even less
apprehension of danger from a frontal
attack.'
Nevertheless after the Russian sue-'
ceeded In taking by. storm the flriBt
line forts on February 2, they, began
a persistant bombardment of the Turk*
Ish center followed 'by a bayonet
charg?, the Impetuosity of which swept
the. defenders off their defeat.
The highest, tribute is paid to the
bravery of the Caucasian troops whose
charja Is conslderedilkely to go down
,ln history as one of the most brilliant
feaTs of the war.
It is recognized here, that the suc
cess ot.the.assault was due almost en

WASHINGTON, Fob. 18.?Senator
Lodge, ranking minority member ot
the Foreign relations committee, made
a speech in the Senate today declaring
that abandonment by the United StateB
at this time of the principal that its
ports are open to, and Its citizens free
to travel on, merchantmen of belliger
ent nations armed solely for defensive
purposes, would be an unneutral act
and a step toward war. He said it
would make the United States the al
ly ot belligerents whose merchantmen
had been swept from the seas.
Senator Sterling, of South Dakota,
spoke on his resolution to declare the
Senate's concern at the recent German
naval order to sink all armed allied
merchantshlps. He said the issue
brought the United States to its grav
est International, crisis. Instead^ of
yielding to the claim, of the, German
admiralty, said he, "Their very men

test. Instead ot denying this old right
of the sea, we should now-of all times
