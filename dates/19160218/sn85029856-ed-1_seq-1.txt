It Was Some Race
The much talked of automobile
race was finally held Wednesday. It
came up to specifications and expecta
tions in every wav, and that the big
crowd (tot its money's worth Is not
doubted. There were eleven entries,
the first car leaving the high school
building promptly at 9 o'clock, and
the balance following at Intervals of
five minutes. II. II. Kldson, driving
a Bulck-six, who left at 9 20, was the
first car back, returning at 2:27; John
Miller of Garden City, also driving a
Buick, left at' 9:1C and returned at
2:55, and Guy Grable of Guytuon, who
drove the HoDkins Ford, left at 9:15
and returned at 3:33. The crowd was
lined up about "three deep" along
each side of the rod for nearly two
miles, and by the time the cars got
out of sight they were several miles
from town and hitting the high
placet In ttie road. The pur-e of
$300 was divided 60, 30, and 10 per
cent, to the winners in the order
above named. The biggest crowd
since circus day last fall was in town
to see the si art and finish or tne race,
and every conceivable bet was made
on the result . Some terrific driving
was done over various sireiches of
good road, but the roads as a whole
were not in racing condition by a big
shot. The report came to town about
1 o'clock that the Buick driven by
Billy Orr had met with an accident
and one man was killed, but reports!
yesterday from Garden City were to
the effect that the car -met with an
accident but no one was hurt. The
whole day was celebrated as a holi
day by the farmers and people of sur
rounding towns, and the merchants
and business houses report an excel
lent trade from the people who came
to see the race.

SPRING
GOO
DS
During our BIG ANNUAL SALE which we
held from January 29 to February 5, we cleaned
up on our Fall and winter goods now we have
a clean slate to work on, and every day v we are,
receiving large shipments of SPRING and
SUMMER merchandise tor every one of our
departments.
Our buyers for our three large stores have been
very busy the past two weeks in Eastern mar
kets, selecting the cream for our stocks. Our
purchases are absolutely for SPOT CASH, and
that, together with buying for three large stores,
gives us a great advantage over the smaller or
one store merchant.
We have made a big change in our store we are al
ways improving, progressing, so that the needs of our
thousands of customers may be better served, Step in
and see the change.
An old customer remarked to us the other day, UI have
traded with you folks for over twenty years, and if a
thing isn't right, you make it right; that's what I like."

Going Up
The Democrat is in receipt of
notices from five different wholesale
houses informing us of an increase
in price in every brand of paper car
ried in stock by them. The increase
in white paper is from 10 to 50 per
cent, and the blue sky is the limit on
colored stock. All existing quota
tions have been withdrawn on every
thing, and the only ray of hope ex
tended the craft is that their
orders will be filled at the very low
est terms possible. Yes, you guessed
it right the first time. The war is
considered responsible for all this,
but why the war should make any
difference in the cost of white paper
deponent knoweth not. The fact
that the importation of dye-stuff
from Germany is cut off is explana
tion for the cost of colored sotck,
and we suppose the other stuff trot
along with it "through sympathy."
Hence, if your next job of work
comes a little higher than formerly
you will know it is the paper manu
facturers' fault and not ours.
Found This on Our Desk
We suggest that instead of taking
someone else'a auto and riding
about until after lip. m., that young
girls and boys repair to their own
homes immediately after church.
This would enable the owners of
said car to follow their inclinations
of going home at a respectable hour
and place girls and boys under par
ental care where they belong. Hope
this doesn't occur agaiff.
