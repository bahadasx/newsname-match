THE RIGHT AND DUTY
OF ORGANIZATION
* Regarding the right, and duty ot
organization of wage earners into
unions, the Manly Report well says:
Organization is fundamental and
necessary for the freedom and well
being of the workers. For it is obvious
that "people can free themselves
from oppression only by organized
, force. No people could gain or main
tain their rights or liberties acting
singly, and any class of citizens in
the state subject to unjust burdens
. or oppression can gain relief only by
combined action."
Collective action on the part of the
workers has been rendered difficult
• and in many cases impossible because
when they have sought by organizing
to lift themselves from helplessness,
to bring living wages from their em
ployers, they have found arrayed
" against them not only the massed
power of capital, but every arm of
- the government that was created to
enforce guarantees of equality and
justice.
It is a first duty, therefore, not. only
' of the workers, but of all citizens
who sympathize with them In theif
struggles, to utilize their civic pow
ers to clear away the many obstacles
which today prevent organization and
collective action. To break down the
laws and court decisions which makes
unlawful for groups of men, not seek
ing profits, actions which would be
lawful for Individuals, which limit or
l* deny the right of free speech, free
press and free assemblage, to abol

mills recently gave a "we-are-part-
ners" banquet to their employes,
during which festivities the wage
earning "partners" were assured by
their justice-loving bosses that unions
were all right, in some industries, but
neither needed nor practical so far
as shingle mills in Washington are
concerned. The interests of capital
ists and wage earners being identical,
why of course collective bargaining
tor the sale of labor-power is un
necessary, as the employers know
how much wages ought to be paid
anyhow. Leave it to them, eh, what?
Sounds pretty smooth, all right, but
somehow this principle of mutual in
terests between bosses and bossed
has not worked out right in other
places, so we cannot but wonder why
unions of mill men are not necessary
in Everett. At any rate, If the inter
ests of capitalists and wage earners
are identical, whal ever unions are
formed in the Interest of the employes
will, of course, redound to the ad
vantage of the employers, on their
principle of mutualism. So the
bosses cannot consistently oppose or
ganization of the employes as the
counterpart of the organization of the
mill owners. That is, if what is good
for one is good for the other. Let's
see, now, if the organized bosses real
ly believe in "fair play."

If you want to see organized labor
continue to grow in strength and num

INDUSTRY'S "PEACE" TOLL
"PREPAREDNESS" NEEDED AT HOME
RISKS OF WORKERS
IN INDUSTRY
(From Geo. P. West, Committee on
Industrial Relations, Washington,
D. C.)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14.—Two hun
dred and fifty thousand men, women
and children are killed each year in
the United States, and 4,700,000 are
wounded because our statesmen re
main silent in the face of the daily
atrocities wrought In times of "peace"
by our system of economic and indus
trial exploitation,
Such is the toll each year in the
United States of poverty and its off-!
spring -preventable disease. The fig- 1
ures are ultra-conservative, being but
half the total number of deaths and j
illness, which, according to the high
est medical authority, could be pre-:
vented by stamping out poverty or
merely by appropriating a third the
cost of one battleship for the public
health. |
They do not include the 100,000
American babies killed by poverty i
each year before they reach their first
birthday. These and the Quarter 11111-'
lion older persons die annually as vic-j
tims of a system by which the few
are protected by the government in
the ownership and arbitrary control
of the land, natural resources and ma
chinery that should be a source of
life and well-being to all.
No president or ex-president lifts
his voice against the ceaseless slaugh
ter wrought by "peace" in America.'
Yet of babies alone, the toll is one I
thousand times greater each year than !
that of the Lusitania torpedoing.
STATESMEN IGNORE ISSUE
Instead of attacking the injustice
and dishonor and cruelty of exploita
tion at home, or appropriating money
with which the death-toll could be cut
in half, our statesmen propose to
spend hundreds of millions to defend
principles and ideals that have been
openly and repeatedly violated here
at home without protest, and that are |
flouted and crucified by men who pose
its our leading citizens.
Nor can anything else be expected
until the victims, the workers and
producers, awake, organize and match
their power against that of those who
now exploit them unchecked.
The Committee on Industrial Rela
tions has used figures at the head of
this column which have been care
fully computed from United States
Census Reports by competent officials
who aided the committee. Surgeon-
General Rupert Blue of the United,
Stales Public Health Service is au-j
thority for the statement that fifty
per cent, of deaths from preventable
disease' can be prevented.
The figures help to explain why
those who see the struggle to con
quer the world for humanity and jus
tice as the only real struggle refuse
to let the issue be clouded by wrang
ling between diplomats over points of
honor that are raised only when the
exploiting classes of two nations come
into conflict, and that are ignored
when these classes are committing
atrocities on the workers of the same
country.
The committee in the present bulle
tin will present evidence showing that

THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE EVERETT TRADES COUNCIL
DEVOTED TO THE INTEREST OF ORGANIZED LABOR.
Labor Temple
EVERYBODY WELCOME
EVERETT, WASH., FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1916.
( poverty is the direct cause of a peace
f I toll of misery, suffering and death in
this country surpassing that suffered
by the armed forces of any belliger
-1 ent country in Europe.
Governmental neglect is the second
cause, and the facts about it will be
'disclosed in a second bulletin. But if
l j the money now piling up in New York
1 banks to the credit of men who are
• preparing an imperialistic campaign
' of world exploitation were distributed
t in higher wages, cheap credits, and
( lower rents, there would be no need
' for governmental action.
WHAT GORGAS SAYS
j .Major General Wm. C. Gorgas is tlie
man who cleaned up Panama and
made possible the digging ot tlie canal.
'He is the highest medical officer of
(the United States army, and a scien
,tist of world reputation. He said:
•'The preventable mortality in this
country is greater than the mortality
caused by the European war. Science
I knows that the chief cause of disease
is poverty: that disease can never be
eliminated so lor>g as people are forc
ed to live poorly and close together."
| Here are the figures compiled in co
operation with government experts
| and endorsed by them, shewing how
poverty kills.
In Brookline, Mass., live the well-to
, do, and the rich of Boston. Babies die
in Brookline at the rate of T'i PER
I THOUSAND. In South Bethlehem,
where live the steel workers, whose!
i brawn and brain produce tlie wealth
I that has glutted Wall Street banks
i and the coffers of Broadway wlne|
I merchants, babies die <tt the rate of I
i 233 PER THOUSAND.
1 Where the people work the hardest,
their babies die the fastest. Poverty
kills them. It is fair to say that the
net result of the American steel in
dustry is killing babies and making
millionaires.
1 East Orange, New Jersey, is an-1
I other wealthy suburban town, wherej
no one works very hard and most of l
I the residents work not at all. Babies
' die there at the rate of 7S PER THOU
SAND.
THREE TO ONE
1 Pall River, Mass., is a center of the
1 textile industry of New England. The
people there produce the wealth that
is spent In towns like Brookline and
East Orange, or on Fifth Avenue in
New York. And their babies die at
the rate of 229 PER THOUSAND.
For every baby of the well-to-do
that dies in East Orange or Brook
line, THREE babies of the POOR,
who .ire also the most industrious, die
'in Fall River cr Sout'i Bethlehem.
[ "in Fall River wages are so low that
many mothers work in the mills
Among 833 infants In Fall River, ii
was found that the infant mortality
I rate among families with non-working
mothers was 160.5, and that among
, families with working mothers was
303.6.
But the rate of 7ti deaths per thou
sand in Brookline or 78 per thousand
in East Orange is far too high. Even
in those towns there are many poor
people, for even there, ihere is some
• work to be done. And the Children's
Bureau of the Department of Labor
■ found that the death rate for Tallies
:| in Montclair. N. J., was only It PER
THOUSAND in a well-to-do ward, as
against 130 PER THOUSAND in 3
ward where the workers live.
The slaughter goes on at two and
three times the Brookline or East Or
ange rate not only in Fall River,
in every factory town in the country.
Everywhere poverty, disease, and
death are greatest in towns where
people work the hardest and produce
the most wealth.
For instance, the infant deat rates |
are 22S per thousand for McKeeßi
Rocks, Pa.; 17G.4 per thousand for
Homestead, Pa.: 190.8 per thousand
for Youngstown, Ohio, and 245 per
thousand for Manchester, N. H.
THE ROLL OF DISHONOR
There is no reason why the death
rates for Brookline and East Orange
should not prevail for the whole Unit
ed States. They would prevail If the!
people were given a chance to live.
According to the United States cen-i
sus, the infant mortality rate for the
United States as a whole is 124 per,
thousand and the total number of
children who died in 1910 was approxi
mately 266,016. If the rate had been
77 per thousand the total number of
deaths would have been reduced by
100.82S babies for that year.
100.COO BABIES WERE KILLED BY
POVERTY
In making the above 'comparison.!
the same method has been used for i
computing the death rates in Brook
line and East Orange as for South
Bethlehem, Fall River. Homestead.
McKecs Rocks, and the other towns
named. The rate was computed in
the only way possible, because of the
lack of birth statistics, by taking the
total number of children under one I
year living when the census of 1910
was taken and total number of deaths
of children under one year in the same
year. The method used when birth
statistics are available, is to take the
total number born during a year and
the total number who dieil during the
same year. This gives a slightly low
er rate and it is on this basis that the J
estimate of a rate of 124 per thousand
for the whole United States is figured
by the United States Census Bureau. [
So that the number that could be 1
saved is really greater than the total
of 100,828 here given.
In California, the infant mortality
rate In Berkeley, a well-to-do suburb
of San Francisco, was ."7.1 per thou
sand. In Los Angeles where an anti
picket ing ordinance and government
by the .Merchants and Manufacturers'
Association prevent the workers from
organizing, and there are many slums
and factories, the rate was 110. Cli
mate In each case cuts down the rate,
but the proportion as between eco
nomic comfort and economic want re
mains the same.
In New York City the United States
Public Health Service found that
among garment workers with annual
earnings of $i>6o or more the child
mortality rate was 114: while among
garment workers with annual earn
ings of $4.st> or less, it was 200.
THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR GOV
ERNMENT
In a second bulletin the committee
will show how poverty takes its toll
in death and suffering among the old

COPPER STRIKE ENDS:
WORKERS MAKE GAINS
i PHOENIX, Ariz —The strike of 5,-
I 000 copper miners in the Clifton, Mor-
I enci and Metcalf district has been
I declared off. Substantial wage in-
I creases have been secured and the
| companies will meet a grievance com
| mittee of employes every month to
adjust difference. The settlement
I was secured through efforts Of Com
missioners Davies and Myers, of the
federal department of labor.
The strike started Sept. 11 last
year, when 6000 employes In the cop
per district suspended work to force
the reinstatement of men discharged
between that date and September 1
for joining the Western Federation of
Miners. The companies refused to
arbitrate this and other demands,
which included higher wages and bet-,
ter working conditions.
The attitude of these companies is
shown In the following signed state
ment by copper operators, shortly aft
er the strike started:
"When it shall appear that condi
tions In this section warrant it and
the companies are satisfied that the i
general sentiment of the community
and their former employes is unani
mous in favor of a resumption of op
erations on the basis of wages and
conditions that have prevailed here
tofore in this district, the companies
reserve to themselves the right to
decide whether or not they will again
start up their plants."
This arrogant attitude was again
shown when Gov. Hunt barred strike
breakers from the copper district.
The operators then started a recall
movement to oust him from office.
The A. F. of L. convention at San
Francisco indorsed the strike and the
appeal for funds to aid these work
ers, whose solidarity has been reward
ed by better working conditions,
higher wages and a knowledge that
through unity they can secure a voice
in the disposal of their labor power.

COPPER STRIKERS WIN!
Publicity a Powerful Aid
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12--The Ari
zona copper strikers have won their
fight.
With copper at the highest price
lor nine years and Gov. George W.
I. Hunt refusing them the use of
armed guards, gunmen and strike
breakers, the copper magnates of
I New York. Boston and Arizona at
|last gave up their attempt to starve
5000 miners and their families into
submission.
The strikers returned to work on
Monday. Jan. 31, under an agreement
by which the companies agree to pay
higher wages and to meet once a
month with grievance committees se
lected by the men.
The victory marks a triumph for
labor of the greatest importance, de
monstrating as it does that labor can
win its battles for industrial democ
racy when the government does its
[duty and protects the workers against
hired thugs and professional strike
Mediators navies and Myers of the
• United States Department of Labor
deserve much of the credit for mak
ing the mine owners see the light.
For months the latter refused to make
any concessions to redress grievances
which the government's investigation
had proved to be real and serious.
They insisted that the strikers first
so back to work. But with copper at
26 cents and with organized labor all
iover the country rallying to the min
erS' support, the mine owners' desire
' for big 1 profits gradually overcame
their opposition to giving their em
ployes a voice in determining the con
ditions of employment.
Substantial wage Increases were
granted. Laborers are to be paid
$2.50 a day instead of $1.62. and mm
ers will receive, at the present price
of copper. $3.41 a day. in accordance
with a sliding scale. Carpenters will
be paid $5 per day. machinists and
boilermakers $5.31.
The settlement followed widespread
publication of the facts of 'the strike
by the Committee on Industrial Re
lations, including publication of ar
ticles in the New York Call and in

which brought the arbitrary conduct
