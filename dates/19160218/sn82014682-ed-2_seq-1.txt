"deliberately false, malicious and de

Joavlnr read the report are acquainted
vith its contents and. who for years
bate been members of the Hawaiian
militia.
. CoL Jones has taken the matter hp
with Delegate Kuhlo at Washington
and asked that documentary evidence
to refute Ueut Whitener's charges be
aubmitted to the. war department.
In this documentary evidence which
is being forwarded, Ueut Whitener's
report Is asserted to be not only, thor
oughly inaccurate as to fact but un
fair and malignant as to conclusion.,
' Ueut Whitener came' to Honolulu
about May 1, 1914, as inspector-general
of the National Guard, remaining
In this pcf'Mi r?1 a. ricrt time ago,
when he w. u.cui to rejoin the reg
ular lnr&ntry, la Kay, 1815, he Blade
a report to the chief cf the division
of military, affairs, war department,
which report he reiterated In the re
port of latt Kovember and largely ex
panded in the statement which is sub
mitted as the results of 1ils observa
tions "for the cent Iteration of the war
department" . ' 1 " V - - V ..
Charge of Polities Made.
In opening this latter report be
cayst .' : -. . M
"Conditions after my arrival, and
until recently, may be summarized as
follows:- The crf&nlzation was large
lv a political one I this wa especially
true of the 2nd ; ttalion bt the regi
ment composed of Hawtllans, with
the exception of one Chinese company.
This one company (Chinese) attended
drills more often than' the .rest and
was more efficient and was hardly a
rrt of the political machine. '
"With the adjutant-general at the
head, the Hawaiian, portion of the Na
tional Guard constituted .' powerful
political machine, most efficient at the
polls, but with indifferent and Ineffi
cient officers at the head, and with
men seldom seen at the drill halL It
was almost Impossible to secure, the
removal of these Inefficient officers;
each was related to Borne senator or
representative, or had, some local in
fiuence that prevented his removal.
However, by resignations and the ap
pointment of some few better men, the
personnel improved slightly during
the first year. Some of the 'dead tlm
. ber was gotten rid of, but with such
a handicap as a political head and
body; indifference and inattention to
duty spread as a dry rot through the
entire organisation." .
Lieut Whitener then goes on to
quote from the report of May 12, 1915. j
lr. this he again emphasizes "the
political character of the present or
ganization, ' and while crediting the
me i
Hawallans with making good soldiers,
says that lt is believed that the Ha-
t-alian officer in command of a Ha
waiian company is a failure, with two
or three exceptions, and added that
the elimination of politics from the
guard would result "In as increased
efficiency as can be hoped for."
November Report Refers to Past
This ends his quotation from the
report of May 12, 1915, and he con
tinues with a much longer discussion
ot the situation as viewed by him last
November.
TThe past Inefficiency of the Na
tional Guard of Hawaii as an organi
zation has not, been due to the char
acter of the officers and men," he
Kays, "or to notable and exceptional
local conditions. The fault has been
at the head. To inefficiency, and poli
tics at the head may be traced all the
other evils that have made efficiency
unattainable. - To this fountain source
may be traced directly the appoint-

Have Been Murdered
' Floating In the water above Wahi
awa dam, two soldiers from the Fort
Castner yesterday afternoon found the
body of Pvt Frank Jackson, Company
u, zstn miantry. -
Deputy Sheriff H. H. Plemer, who Is
making an Investigation, found no

suspicion exists (hat Jackson may
have been thrown In the water and
drowned. Plemer will hold a coroner's
Inquest sometime next week.
; MaJ. Horace D. Bloombergh, Medical
Corps, made an examination . of. the
body and decided. that Jackson was
probably drowned at least five days
ago. . ;
Jackson has been absent from post

Saturday, February 12. For the last
three pay days, his comrades say, he
has been coming to Honolulu and
drinking heavily and one theory la
that he had been drinking and fell In
the water while on his way back to
post
Following closely after the murder
of Pvt Jesse Ector, 25th Infantry, who
was murdered at the top of Kole Kole
pass, the finding of Jackson's body,
evenwith no evidence of foul play,
will bring a close investigation. Ec
tor's death is still shrouded in mys
tery, out Sheriff Plemer and Hono
lulu detectives, as well as army offi
cers, are still trvinr to find a. rlna tn
his murderers. .

ment has reached its greatest exempli
fication in Ithe world's history, effec
tually disposes of the fear that this

America's present Immense material
wealth and. present military helpless
ness makes her an inviting field for

adequately prepared for any crisis
that may arise.

don a principle hitherto recognized and observed by America, that its
