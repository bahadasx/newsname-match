Kditok Ikuepkudknt:
Among the many privileges of ray
stay of many years in the city -of
Washington was that, of seeing and
hearing Dwight L. Moody, Ira D! San
key and T. Dewitt Talmage, men who
. left undying fame in the domain of
American religious life,
The greatest of these was. Moody.
The very goodness of the man and the
kindness of his heart streamed forth
like electric currents from a dynamo.
He got close to the people, was a
counselor and friend and his good
deeds follow him. He was an enor
mously large man, weighing perhaps
not less than 300 pounds, and he
looked like the tall stump of an old
treo in the midst o his Immense audi
ences. I heard him in .the great
convention Hall at Washington in
1894. Sankey conducted the music
service. Will we ever see another gos-
pel singer like Sankey? ' I think not.
He was six feet three inches tall, and
large in proportion, and his voice filled
that hall, where ten thousand eager
listeners were swept over by the sweet
thunders of his tones. He sang only
his own compositions, such a3 "There
are Loriely Hearts to Cherish, While
the Days are Going By," and his own
rendition of "Rock of Ages." The
closing notes sounded as if he were
singing double notes an octave apart.
I never heard anything like it. And
he was an old man then. What must
he have been ' in his prime Then
lloody arose, and when that melodi
ous, pleading voice touched the ears
of the listeners, and his gigantic arms
Btreached out that voice which,
though not loud, penetrated to every
nook of the immense hall you could
feel the warm thrill of religious mag
netism go through the multitude, ard
the swarms of people, the thousands,
who gathered and knelt- with him
around the altar, attested his power,
for to move a Washington congrega
tion like that means a great deal.
His words were simple , and easily
understood; there were no poetic
flights, and no attempts to stir the
-pecpla by any but a plain appeal to
their hearts and understanding. I
believe most of his converts were
steadfast, and that he did a great deal
of good. . .Moody and Sankey have
long since! gone to their eternal re
ward; but their work lives after them.
The. Moody Institute at Northfield,
Mass., is a permanent monument to
one of the greatest preachers . the
world ' has seen. My wife's niece
graduated from there, and she cannot
praise the institution enough for its
good work for girls, in useful educa
tion and religious training. . " '
We now come to that remarkable
man, Thomas Dewitt Talmage. No
preacher since St. Paul has had a
wider hearing for his sermons. They
were published in thousands of papers,
in many languages, and reached ' mil
lions of readers each week. . He came
to Washington in the early nineties
as assistant pastor Of the First Pres
byterian church, having had his
Brooklyn Tabernacle three times
burned, and taking that as a sign that
the Lord wanted him elsewhere. The
baseball phrase of "three strikes and
out" appealed to him as correct. I
think he had become somewhat soured
by the time he reached Washington,
for his heart did not seem to be in
the work. Still there was no fallicg
off in that wonderful flow of poetic
imagery and religious fire that made
his name a household word over half
. the earth. But, although the rainbow
is an object of beauty, it does not
warm us, nor do the fairest flowers
of earth serve us as food. His beau
tiful words and earnest gestures were
impressive in the extreme, but how
many weary souls did he lead to the
feet ot the Savior! I do not wish to
epeak uncharitably of this great man,
nor rcb him of one ray of the. glory
that gilds bis tomb, but I am going
to say, as a truth in every word, that
"what cornea from the heart goes to
the heart," and that the great preach
er Talmage appealed more to our
eense of art and sublimity than to the
aoula wbVwere hungry for spiritual
bread.- He was the unrivaled poet of
the pulpit, and when I say tbafcj give
him the highest praise that is coming! i ' 1 '.. 1 , '"" 1 " 1 " .m n, j . .,, ' ",
him the highest praise that is coming
to him. For I came in close personal
contact with the , man, and know
whereof I speak. He who had supped
at the table of the Russian Czar by
special invitation, and had the largest
congregation of any preacher living
or dead, and the largest vocabulary
of English employed by any man since
Shakespere, was not the man to lead
a Christian Endeavor meeting, or to
sit down by the bedside of a dying
man in. sweet comradeship. It was
too much to expect of him, no doubt,
put I did expect it.
An old gentleman named Sneden
was on his death bed. I sat and told
him of Talmage's wonderful words
spoken the Sunday before. The ser
mon was about children, and the great
preacher, extending his long arm out
ward, pointed into' the air, and said:
"Do you see that little child there,
happy in its careless play," (and when
Talmage told you something was
there, you could almost see it.) "If
that young life were to close tomor
row, you would not weep, but would
only tiiluk of it as-one baby less in
this world of sorrow. But I tell you,"
(and his voice rang with a mighty
emphasis that carried his tones far
out to the street.) "that the soul of
that child shall blossom in glory a
quadrillion years 'after the sun," moon
and stars shall have been swept like
chaff from the threshing floor of eter
nity." 0, what a magnificent sent
ence, and what a magnetic thrill
swept the audience upon its delivery!
But my poor old friend Sneden was
nearing that sad hour where he, too,
was to be swept like chaff from the
floor of earthly existence, and it took
something more than beautiful phrases
to touch and comfort him. With a
pleading look in bis eyes, he said to
me: "If Dr. Talmage is in this town I
want him to come and let me take
his hand just once before I cross over
the river, and thank him for all the
beautiful sermons I used to hear him
preach in Brooklyn. I believe if you
will go and tell him about me, he will
come and do ma that favor, for I do
admire him'so much."
I had no desire to push myself into
the society of the great, but that ap
peal was too much for me, and I sought
out Dr, Talmage at his very palatial
home on Massachusetts avenue. A
snarl uexrir ralei in uniform met me
and escorted ma into one of the sev
eral beautiful apartments, all .hung
with rich tapestry, and carpeted with
crimson velvet that yielded no sound
to the footstep. The 'darkey went
upstairs to see the noted divine, and
soon a tall figure descended the stair
case, "grand, gloomy and peculiar,"
one hand in his bosom, and jttie other
by his side. ' Did he come forward,
extend his hand and say "howdy" like
one of our good old McNairy preach
ers? No, indeed. "What can I do
for you?" was all he said. In a few
few words I told him about my old
friend Sneden, who wanted so much
to see him before crossing the dark
river. Talmage looked at his heavi
ly jewelled watch, and said with a
British drawl, totally unlike his preach
ing voice: "I am very, very sorry, but
I cahnt help your oM friend. I have
to go out driving this offternoon, and
then, as you may know, I must pre
pare my sermon for Sunday and am
editing a weekly paper, and a book
besides." I told him, how easy it
would be, while be was out driving, to
step in for a few minutes, and make
this old man happy in his last hours,
even if only by taking him by the hand
and saying-a word or two. "Too
busy, too busy. Very, very sorry
Good afternoon, good afternoon!" and
the famous preacher was gone. 1 It
was hard to have to tell the poor old
dying man that the great preacher
was too busy to see him. As a mat
ter of fact, Talmage took the address
J gave him, No, 1633 Marion street,
but he never called. Every word of
this is strictly true. It may have
been very hard for hira to see all who
called for him, but I have always
thought he made a mistake there.
President McKinley once went to 'the
humble dwelling of an old army com
rade in Washington, and sat some
time talking with him. in tire midst
of cares of atate (it was daring the
Spanish war) and found time to make
one poor soul happy. Sometime the
big things of this life look small and
little things become of serious mo
ment.' . , . i

To all Parents and Teachers
Recently, samewhere along the line
of railroad which runs through your
town, the lives of two innocent boys
and one innoceut little girl have been
crushed out by an engine, or cars.
The loss of these innocent children's
lives was due to their lack of knowl
edga of the danger of going upon a
railroad track, or on and about cars
on a railroad track. y '
This paper is sent you with a view
of interesting all school teachers and
parents in the "Safety First" move
ment, and in the hope that you. will
bring pointedly to the attention of
your children and your scholars the
danger of going upon a railroad track.
It is important to educate children
against doing the things - that will
likely result in harm to them.' , The
number of children killed or maimed
on railroads in the United States in a
year is staggering. ,
Will you not please caution the
children under your care, not once,
but frequently, against walking or
playfflg upon a railroad track, or
against crossing a railroad track at
any place except a public crossing,
and against crossing at any place
without stopping to look and listen?
Particularly warn them against jump
ing on or off of moving or standing
cars. ' - ' ,
If you will ask the children under
your charge as to how many of them
go upon or play upon railroad tracks
or cars you will be surprised to find
out the. number that do so, wholly un
conscious of the great and constant
danger they subject themselves to.
It is too late after the accident has
happened.
We ask your aid and co-operation
in the "Safety First" movement. '

MUST QUIT EATING
CROP BEFORE MADE
South Must Stop Time-Honored Sys
tem Of Economio Suicide,
Say H. G. Haatingt
Atlanta., Ga. (Special.) "The peo
ple of the south must ault eatinc ttt(r
cotton or other so-called 'cash crop"
before it is made if they ever expect
to accumulate wealth and bare the
comforts and luxuries of life due
them," says H. O. Hastings, agricul
tural vice president of the Atlanta
Chamber of Commerce, and a tore
most authority oa farm conditions la
the southeast.
"The south must stop forever Its
time-honored system of economic sui
cide," says Mr. Hastings. "Advance
steps were made last year toward a
condition of farm independence ia the
Cotton Bolt They were forced steps,
it is true, but they marked an advance
just the same, and more bread aqd
meat, more grain, forage and other
food and feed stuffs were made in
1915 than ever before, with the result
there are tens of thousands of farm
ers better off than in past years,
despite short crops and business de
areHsion. "With higher cotton prices, It Is
going to be a great temptation to
drop back into the old habit ot put
ting cotton, or whatever other cash
crop one may be growing, in pawn
for bread and meat. We are suffer
ing today from the old system forc
ed pn us by conditions following the
Civil war, necessary then, but unnec
essary now. ..,
"Year after year we have stayed in
the same old rut as a matter ot habit,
eating our . crops, so to speak, before
they were made, a financially suicidal
policy for the farmer, each year put
ting his nose a little closer to the
credit grindstone.
"It the south had not been so rich
In natural resources, this system
would have bankrupted us long ago.
Wh&t's the answer? It is home pro
duction by each farmer of every dol
lar's worth of food and grain supplies
needed on his farm that it is possi
ble to grow on his own acres. This
means good big home gardens; bogs,
cliiken, cows and something to feed
them on through the year." .
