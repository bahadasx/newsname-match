SPRAYED ORCHARD BEATS
BAD MARKET CONDITIONS
Missouri Farmer Gets 600 Bushels of
Apples From Trees Previously
of Little Value
It cost a farmer of DeKalb County,
Missouri, $100 to spray an apple or
chard of less than one acre. This far
mer had heard of a man who lived
several miles away who had made
money spraying his orchard. The lat
ter had two sons who had attended
the Short Course in Agriculture at the
University of Missouri at Columbia.
The. boys were pruning and spraying
the home orchard, and the results they
obtained gave their work a wide pub
licity. . . - j
The farmer who had the following
experience in spraying owned a small :
family orchard of only 77 trees. He
had obtained no first class, unblem-'
ished fruit from it, so he asked the
Short Course men to show him how to
spray the trees. The boys agreed to '
furnish the material and to do the1
Work for one-half of the marketable
apples. . , ; . - j
The arrangements were made so
late that only two of the three requir
ed applications of spray were made.
Lime sulphur and lead arsenate was
the spray used and it was applied in j
six and one-half days. They used1
$7.25 worth of spray material. About
600 bushels of marketable apples were
harvested. The boys took home 35
bushels for family use and sold the
rest of their one-half share back to
the owner of the orchard for $85, far
below market price, for the apples
were sold in the orchard. Thus six
and one-half days work plus $7.25 in
spray material netted a good return
for the boys. While it cost the far-
I mer about $100 for the care of his or
chard, it was well worth while to him
p-
as a business venture, because had
I the orchard not been sprayed the fruit
would have been almost worthless
with the market as it was last year.
This DeKalb County farmgr believes
in spraying now. He will do bis own
work after this but the Short Course
boys made almost enough put of his
orchard to pay for their way through
one term of the course.

A Word of Warning
Are you sure the Mattresses you are now offering
for sale contain new, clean material thruout?
Don t attempt to answer this question until you have
ripped open a couple of the .Mattresses now in your
Warehouse. Settle it in your own mind NOW.
The abnormal conditions prevailing at present war
rant the most rigid inspection of all so-called Cotton
Felt Mattresses.
If no Sanitary Bedding Law is applicable to your
State, you may be paying regular prices for Mattress
containing unsanitary material, possibly laden with
disease germs, and ore, therefore, deceiving yourself
and impairing the health of your customers.
Look out for flashy tick patterns showy r open-end
samples the inside of the Mattress' will tell the
story as never before.

Ike above warning was mailed to mattress dealers
in states where there were no sanitary bedding laws. So well
does it present the danger of buying ordinary mattresses that
