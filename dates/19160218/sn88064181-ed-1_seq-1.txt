SCOFFINS, CASKETS
AND
BURIAL ROBES
I have on hand a complete line of Coffins, Caskets and Burial Robes,
Swhich I will Sell at the very lowest possib!e prices in conformity to the
class of goods that I handle.
When the Grim Resyer visits the home, those bowed down in grief are unable to attend
to the details and I make a specialty of the work of supplying everything that is needed
and at reasonable prices.

HOW TO SAY "SALONIKI."
As to Saloniki, the people on the
spot put the stress on the "on," and
make the penultimate syllable short.
And in this case the Italians seem
to be at fault, for the spelling in
their newspapers is "Salonicea," and
the Italian double eonsonant imnplies
a very strong elnmjllasis. Beware,
too, of lerzegovina when that name
colies forward, as it probably will;
its penultimate syllable is short

1DON'T LIKE TO SEE
THEIR ACTS PICTURED
"The Birth of A Nation" Not
True, Says Erudite At
torney of the North.
'The Birth of A Nation,"
Tlhonmas Dixon's masLerpiece.
which has but recently been
I)icturized, is held in bad repute
by a learned district attorney
of New York, who has interven
ed to prevent the showing of the
l)icture in that state, saying that
the picture is untrue and'an in
sult to the north, and as a re
sult the matter is hung up in the
curts for a final decision.
"The Birth of A Nation" is
the true story of the rise and
fill of the Southern Confederacy
from the versatile pen of Dixie's
,ost distinguished writer, Rev.
Thomas Dixon, who is one of
tue unregenerated sons of the
Old South, one who is familiar
with her customes and who
loves her traditions, and in this
work he has but told the truth
which grates severely upon the
nerves of the aforesaid district
atterney. Truth is sometimes
stranger than fiction, and of
times harsher, too,
Those who have read any of
Mr. Dixon's works, will have
no trouble in guessing just what
part of the truths told by this
writer "got the goat" of the
district attorney, but for the
benefit of those who have not
read "The Clansman" or "The
Birth of A Nation," we will say
that what hurts the aforesaid
district attorney is the vivid
and true portrayal of the hellish,
fiendish and raping u
Carpet-a-gger ,.:-i
close of the war.
The civil war has passee into
history, the brave and generous
souls in blue and gray who
fought and fell under the colors
they loved so well are re-united
in a mansion not built by hands
beyond the clouds of battle while
the few remaining veterans of
blue and gray have long agoi
shook hands across the blood
stained hills of Gettysburg, but
tie rule of the carpet-hagger in
the South will never be forgotten
or forgiven
Mr. Dixon's story is true-too
true-and as a result it is to be
suppressed by one of the very
states responsible for such hor
rible truth. The writer has
read all of Mr. Dixon's works,
has seen "The Clansman" and
"The Leopard's Spots " pre
sented and also had the pleasure
several weeks ago of seeing
"The Birth of A Nation" and
every son and daughter of the
South should read these books
and see these plays.
RUJR4I CREDITS BILL
iMAY PASS CONGRESS
Will rovide for Land Mort
gage Banks that will be
Most Beneficial to South
A al credits law is likely to
me onf the results of this ses
sior. The admni;ntration is
pres g for action along the
lines ' a bill reported by the
Joini; Committee of the House
and nate which was created
last 5ion. This bill provides
for d mortgage banks, twelve
in n hber, known as federal
land £ks, each in a separate
dist . ter the manner of the
feder .leserve system. Tilese
bau Would have a pail up Cap
ital not less than $0i0,O000 and
wou e authorized to issue ie
bentu bonds based on land
mor ges to an amount not ex
cee twenty times their capi- 1
tal surplus. The mortages
wou be a first lien on improv
ed f s occupied by .he own
ers for not exceeding fifty
per. 6t. of-the appraised value
of property. The loan must I
be , expenditures upon the
farm ch as the purchase of the,
far ,r improvemetts, stock, '
ors isnvestmeilt. Every mort
gag uld run for at least five
year s nd thereafter -could be
pai V.hole or part on any in
tere, $te. They would pro
vi a egular payment of
not ' than one per cent. on
the nipal would extinguish
the 'ti"o 36 years. The bill
pro d .;for local associations
kno as atlonal farm loan
au ' stQ be composed of
"c borrower, must
the ttent of five per cent. of
his loan, and there are other co
opertive features. The capital
emp1oyed would, be in the begin
ning government, capital, but
govfrnmentmoney, it is not pro
vided, would make way for pri
vate money as the farmers them
selves entered into the co-opera
tive investment and furnished
their own money.
The Department of Labor has
a large mark to its credit in the
part it took in settling the Ari
zona copper strike. Secretary
of Labor Wm. B. Wilson seat
two mediators, Messrs. Myers
and Davies, in accordance with a
provision in the law creating the
Department of Labor. These
men traveled between Arizona
and New York investigating and
acting intermediaries between
the union miners and the New
York corporation directors, and
finally the latter were persuad
ed to act along the line of en
lightened selfishness and to re
sume their profits by dividing a
small share of them with their
employee3.
The Governodof Arizona, W.
P. Hunt, is entitled likewise to
a great deal of credit for his re
fusal to allow the importation of
gunmen as th3 mine ow-ners de
sired. There was no violence or
bloodshed in this strike, in great
contrast with the C:lorado troub
les where Governor Ammons was
not so wise or courageous as
Governor Hunt.
Representative Wmin. Kent of
California expects to oontribute
substantial help to the cmpf'en,
for mitigating tuberculosi3 by
the passage of a bill "to stand
dize the treatment of tubercul
osis in the United States an]
piovide ifde: al aid f'r caringl
for inlig~ent tuberculous per
son''. Certain hospitais and
samltariuij)s are to be designated
which may receive aid from the
federal t'eawuiy for earing fir
hepless tuberculosis patie,!iT,
under the :sutpervision of the PI't!b
lic-Health Service. A hearing
on his bill was recently held ,e

know, but n:t having time to
dig through thi vast volume of
the Con:.;r.~ -,;o:.I 1c,,rlJ. For
instance, the liC'st uunber sets
down the illuminating fact that
the total nl,, ;' of biils introduc
ed between December 6, whenCon
gress convened a,:d Dec 17, when
it adjomr'ncd for the holidays,
was 6,483, and of these all but
265 were private pork biils.
There were 4,1 44 private pension
bills introducee in these eleven
days; there were 191 bills to
change military records (preliin
inary to pentions;) there were
1;037 private claims bills, there

being a national legislature, is
really a machine for grinding out
prepared pork for private politi
cal purposes.
EXCELLENT SERBIAN CUSTOM.
One of the unusual Serbian insti
tutions which bids fair to vanish un
der the conqueror's hands is the Za
druga, a glorified family system said
to have saved the Serbians from pov
erty and all its attendant evils, and
left them one of the gayeat races of
mankind. In the Zadruga one house
grows from another until a little
community is established on some
thing like socialistic principles. The
stareshine, or headsman, and his
wife live in the biggest house and
direct the industries of the satellite
h~usn.

HOG CHOLERA
Th' alarm :raches me that
th:at much dreaded disease of
hogs. cholera, is causing great
loss agoain in our parish. Why?
Twenl y-1iv., years ago we might
tnt have answered th!s question
but now every farmer ought to
be able to stop it. It costs
about 20c per hundred to abso
lutely prevent this disease by
use of anti-toxin serum, injected
hypodermically. The agricul
turalist at Grayson is equipped
for the business and willing to
go when and wherever possible.
lie charges nothing for the o0
erat ion, you supply an automo
biue for him or railroad fare and
let hiim know two days before
he is to immune your hogs, how
many you have and approxi
mately their weights. . He will
telegraph for the serum and it
will come c. o. d. Don't wait
till the cholera gets in your
ierd, the risk is too great. Burn
or bury all dead hogs. quaran
tine all sick ones or kill them if
they have cholera. Keep well
hogs in a sanitary place, give
eklan water and food. Don't
carry cholera germs on your
shoes from dead or sick hogs to
well ones.
The vaccination will keep the
hogs immune from cholera for
six months, but if they are
treated and then exposed to
cholera they will take a mild
form of cholera that is not se
vere at all and then be immune
from it for life.
Write, phone or come to see
me. I will come if I can leave
the school, sometimes I can.
Yours sincerely,
KARL TREEN,
Agriculturist.
PANTS AND TROUSERS WANTWI
A great lady in France wants
300 pairs of pants. Of course we
know that "trousers" is the proper
word, but that shorter and uglier
word is so neatly rhythmic in associ
ation with the name of our great asis
ter republic that we simply couldn't
resist. The lady in question is
Madame Waddington, author of
charming and interesting books; and
the trousers so devoutly desired are
for convalescent French soldiers. A
friend of Madame Waddington's has
arranged to take to Paris all the good
American trousers offered for the
good cause and there is a dim hope
that before very long there will be at
least a few Frenchmen visible on the
streets of Paris attired in nether gar
iments that give the impression of
having been made for a human be.
