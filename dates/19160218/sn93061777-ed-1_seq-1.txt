Peanuts a Money Crop
R. C. Hatch, who formerly re
sided )' Clovia, was here the
first of the week and" in conver
sation with a News reporter
stated that he had shipped out
40 cars of peanuts in Howard
County Texas the past season
and that as much as eighty cars
had been shipped from there this
year. The peanut raisins indus
try there is just in its infancy,
he stated, and that those who
have planted the crop are well
pleased with the experiment and
are going in heavy from now on.
He believes that the sandy loam
soil, to be found in this county,
will grow peanuts better than
the country where he now re
sides. He says that there is just
as much rainfall here and that
the soil is, if anything, richer
than that of Howard county, of
which Big Springs is the chief
marketing point. There is just
as much wind there as here and
as he farmed here for several
years he sees no reason why the
sandy loam soil of Curry county
cannot be made more valuable
by growing peanuts, than the
tight wheat land north of town,
which now is generally consider
ed of greater value. The pea
nut market is strong and is get
ting better every year and the
demand is greatly increasing.
There is more nutrition in a
pound of peanuts than in two
pounds of the very best steak.
The percentage of portein matter
is mueh greater and they are not
injurious to the health. W. C.
Parish of Clovis, alone consumed
eight or ten barrels of shelled
peanuts last year, which would
indicate something of the de
mand right here at home. Mr,
Parish states that the best pea
nuts that he bought were raised
by S. J. llobbs on sandy land
near Blacktower and that when
Mr. Hobbs planted peanuts he
also planted watermelons and
pumpkins on the same land and
that in this manner the vines lie
came interwoven and the soil did
not blow. The nuts were of the
jumbo variety and were excep
tionally large and fine. These
however do not command the
highest market prices. The
News would suggest to the
farmers in the sandy loam dis
trict to try a few acres of pea
nuts this year and ascertain how
they pay as a money crop. It is
possible that it will bring better
returns than the best wheat
land of the northern part of the
county which last year produced
over forty bushels of wheat to
the acre.
Money in Beans
J. W. Leagan, of Bellview,
was in Clovia Monday with a big
load of Mexican beans which he
readily disposed of at 41 2 cents
wr pound. According to Mr.
Leagan' d figures his beans will
bring him about $32 per acre.
This is not a bad showing on $10
per acre land. Last year was
an off year for the bean growers
of Mr. Legan's section. Said
he: "The average is about 1000
pounds to the acre, and this is a
sure crop. The acreage will be
much larger than ever before
this year."
Land Wanted

quarter sections in Curry or
Knosevelt Counties; don't write

New Church Building
Quite rapidly is Curry county
pushing to the front along all
lines of legitimate endeavor,
materially, educationally, spiritually.
Monday Rev. J. T. Lewis was
in the city circulating a petition
for funds with which to erect a
Methodist church building five
miles south and four miles east
of town, of which J. R. Webb
is pastor. This building is to
cost $1500. Will be frame,
twenty eight by forty two feet,
with a Beating capacity of 800.
The walls are to be twelve feet
high, with aich ceiling. There
is to be a solid concrete founda
tion. The corner stone will be laid
Sunday at 2 p. m. February 27.
Kev. Messer, of Clovis and Rev.
Allison, of Roswell, will officiate
at this service. A splendid pro
gram will be rendered at that
time. A very cordial invitation
is extended to the public to at
tend this service.
Dame Rumor
We hear it rumored that ithe
Methodist of Clovis are prepar
ing to erect a $10,000 or 12,000
church edifice. The Methodist
folks are a people who do large
things, and while this is mere
rumor, we snould not be sur
prised to see this building go up.
Such a building would be a
credit to that church and to our
city. Let the goou work go on.
Who said when Clovis went dry
it would kill the town?
Remodeling His Building
J. R. Walker has a force of
men at work this week remodel
ing the Highway Garage build
ing that he recently purchased.
A concrete floor will be put in
and the building remodeled
throughout. When finished this
will be one of the very best meat
market establishments in he
city. There are twelve rooms
on the second floor. These will
all be put in the best condition
for housekeeping purposes.
Mr. Walker is a hustler, a
successful business man and a
splendid citizen, who believes
that Clovis is to continue to
grow bigger and better. And
is helping along the good work.
New Auto Agency
This week E. M. Johnson, of
the Chalmers Motor Co., visited
several sections of Curry county,
and was so well pleased with
the county as a farming and
stock proposition, that he de
cided to establish an agency here
for his company. "We are go
ing to help the farmers," was
about the way Mr. Johnson put
it. Mr. Claud Miller will be in
active charge of the Chalmers
Motor Car Company's business
here. Mr. Miller is an old timer
in Clovis, being here when the
town of Clovis was platted He
was formerly actiyely connected
with the W. I. Luikart & Co.
store. He wondered off into
Oklahoma, where he really tried
hard to be satisfied, for about
eight years, but it was no go, so
Mr. Miller came back to Clovis
to stay. And as he has fully re
pented of his error, we gladly
welcome him as a citizen and in
to the business activities of our
busy, bustling little city.

Prosperous Condition
Mr. A. Mandell of the Mandell
Clothing and Dry Goods Co., re
turned Wednesday from St
Louis, where he went to buy
the summer stock of goods for
his house. Mr. Maadell is very
enthusiastic over the financial
outlook for the whole country.
He says that conditions never
appeared better. Most of the
factories of the entire country
are working day and night to
supply the un precedent demand
fur thtir products. Mr. Mandell
predicts that conditions will con
tinue to grow even better with
tne coming months. In view ot
the present excellent financial

has purchased an extra large
and well selected stock of goods,
some of which he is having
rushed in by express.

A Social Success
One of the greatest social
successes of the ytar was the
Leap year ball given by the
ladies of Clovis, of which Mes
dames Drs. Miller, Chapman and
W. B. Mersfelder were special
arrangement committee.
At shortly after nine the music
began for the grand march,
which was led by Mrs. Herod
and Dr. Chapman, couples
gradually filling in the circle un
til the spacious hall was a solid
unit. At the head of the isle
little Misses Montel Mansfield
and Margaret Fleming handed
out the programs for the even
ing, which bore very appropriate
symbols of the occasion. The
programs for the gentlemen
bore a crimson cupid, while
those of the ladies had affixed
the trey 'o Hearts. The gentle
men, who had observed the an
nouncement of this very singular
affair, were most curious less
the ladies might not carry out
their contemplation to the letter,
but such curiosity was dispelled,
we have no hesitation in saying,
ere the evening was over; the
arrangements for their company,
escorting, and securing dances,
all were theirs, and that they
made the best of their privilege,
is now admitted.
The hall was appropriately
decorated for the occasion. Fes
toons were strung from the
center to the eves of the room,
and pendant hearts of varying
sizes were everywhere in evi
dence. Luncheon of coffee and
sandwiches were served.
R. E. Brown For Treasurer
Mr. R. E. Brown, whose an
nouncement appears in this
paper for the office of Treasurer
of Curry county, is go well
known hire that we deem it al
most euperflous to add more.
However, for the benefit of the
new comers who might not know
Mr. Brown, we will say, that he
has lived in Clovis for the past
seven years, has ever been ac
tive in the advancement of the
town and county and is a lifelong
Democrat. He is now filling
successfully the Treasurers of
fice, to which he was appointed
in September, 1914, by the
County Commissioners upon the
resignation of Mr. Taylor, It is
stated, by those who know, that
his books are in perfect con
dition. Mr, Brown is careful
and painstaking in the discharge
of his duty. He it always on
the job,
Good Material for Office.
Miss Sallie G. Bryant, of Por
tales, paHsed through Clovis
Thursday motning enroute to
LaLande to attend a teachers
meeting there. Miss Bryant is
a candidate for the office of
county superintendent of R)ose
velt county. Sue is one of the
most capable women in this part
of the state, and if elected to
the office to which she aspires,
tioosevelt county can well be
oroud of her superintendent.
Miss Bryant is a sister to Ex
Representative R. G. Bryant
who will bo the next Senator
from Roosevelt county, Mr.
Bryant u a man who stands
four square for everything that
is best for the people. With him
in the Senate from Roosevelt
county, and Mr. Mersfelder in
the Senate from Curry county,
this part of eastern New Mexico
will be mighty well represented,
it appears to the present quill
pusher of the News.
A Near Blaze
What came near being a real
bad fire was nipped in the bud
by the quick work of J. A. Mc
Farlin and the fire department
about ten o'clnck Monday morn
ing. It is supposed that some
campers, who had occupied the
McFarlin camp house during the
night, in taking the ashes out of
the stove got some live coals of
fire also. All was dumped into
a wooden box. This was burned
through, also the floor and some
time later a fire was discovered
under the floor. As there was a
great deal of dry feed in the
adjoining building it looked for
a short time like a disasterous
fire wa3 certain.
Mexican Killed.
Francisco Martinez, a Mexi
can, was run over by passenger
train No. 22 early Monday morn
ing and instantly killed. We

L. C. Mersfelder For Senator
It is with no little pleasure
that the News calls attention to
the announcement of Ex-County
Superintendent L. C. Mersfelder
for the State Senate subject to
the Democracy of Curry county.
For many years Mr. Mersfelder
filled, successfully and satisfac
torily the office of County School
Superintendent of this county,
retiring from that office of his
own accord, and he is too well
known in this entire section to
need any words of commenda

to say for the benefit of the new"
settlers in the county, that Mr.
Mersfelder is a man of superior
business acumen; a man of un
questioned integrity; a man who
will be a tower of strength and
do much good for this county,
if elected to the office for which
he aspires. We know of no one
better fitted for the office

We Like Him
We like the fellow who has a
conscience, who regards his ob
ligations sacredly, whose word
is as good as his bond. If this
were true of everyone, this
special National Pay Up Week,
would be unnecessary, for the
simple reason that every week,
every day would be rounded out
right.
A certain man in Clovis bought
a milk cow, some months since
from one of our citizens, on the
monthly installment plan, Every

met. Either the day before or
the day the note falls due, this
man telephones the man from
whom the cow was bought,
'come and get your money.'
Just at the peep o' day Tues
day, and while the oforemention

mentioned cow, was sweetly
snoozing with naught to disturb
his dreams, jing-a-ling. jing-a-ling,
bang! went the telephone
for about one long minute. Fire,
murder, earthquake, or what
under heavens could it be. After
bumping our shins against a half

phone. "Well, who is it, and

what do you want?" "This is
