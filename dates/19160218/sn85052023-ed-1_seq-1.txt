MURDER CASES Xx
ON DOCKET
For Trial At February Term of Cir
cuit Court Which Begins Here
jv, Next Monday Morning
Circuit Court begins Monday next
and the indications are that this will
prove one of the busiest sessions that
has been- held here in some time.
There are only two weeks allowed
for court here during the February
term and there is a lot of business on
both the criminal and civil dockets.
Two murder cases are set for trial
at the present term of court. The
trial of Ethridge Alford who shot
Oliver Smith to death near McKinney
last summer is docketed for the pre
sent term and Joe Hocker who killed
Bob Gardner, another negro, in the
Hubble section a few months ago, is
also to be tried. There are some 10
or a dozen felony cases on the dock
et, which will also be hard fought
and occupy much of the court's time.
A number of civil actions have Deen
file'd also so that Judge Kardin and
the other court officials will probably
be kept very busy every day of the
two weeks' session.
Peter Goss, of Whitley county,
through his attorneys Morrow &
Morrow and Robert B. Waddle, of
Somerset, has filed suit against the

Cincinnati Southern railroad for $1,
000 damages to his property alleged

present term of court. Through At

wife Ellen Smith. Alfred Coffman
V.lio afks legal reparation from his

ELECTION CALL ANNULLED
Petitions Asking For Vote On Road
Bonds Lacking in Names
The road bond election called by
Judge Bailey Monday for April 15th,
has been called off. Th order of the
county court fiixing the date for the
election, was set aside when it was
found that the petitions filed here
Monday do not comply with the law.
It was found that the names of "free
holders" on the petitions were not
sufficient in number under the law
to call an election. The law requires
that a petition shall be signed by at
least 150 "freeholders," and by that
is meant property owners, to make
legal a call for such an election, and
the petitions filed here Monday did
not contain the. names, of 150 prop-j
erty owners, over iou names were
on the petitions but many of them
were not property owners, which was
discovered when the officials went
over the petitions preparatory to is
suing the necessary call for an elec
tion. Those who have been advocat
ing the calling of another road bond
election say that this oversight can
and will be promptly remedied and
that petitions containing more than
the required 150 property owners'
names will be filed with the county
court on March court day.

SHORTAGE IN TOBACCO PREDICTED
Fertilizer Scarcity May Affect Other States
Figures Take Upward-Jump at Danville.
A tobacco shortage, the like of
which has not existed in a generation
will probably face 'the United States
next year. Now that the present
season is nearing the close it has been
discovered that not more than half a
crop was produced in Kentucky the
past year. This alone would not
have been sufficient to cause anxie
ty but consternation was thrown into
the tobacco raising sections of Vir
ginia and North and South Sarolina
the past month when fertilizer com
panies announced an increase of over
200 per centum in all kinds of ferti
lizers due to war conditions and oth
er influences which have served to
produce a scarcity. Potash, one of
the principal ingredients of first class
fertilizers, has jumped to $500 per
ton. A South Carolina warehouse
man, who has been in Danville this
week, states that in the three states
named not over half a crop can be
produced the coming season, and
that tobacco growers will increase
other crops and cut in half their to
bacco acreage. This situation, com
bined with the short Kentucky crop
this year, is calculated to produce a
great shortage next year. In the light
of these developments there has been
in the past few days a decided ten
dency to higher prices already. The
indications are that this year will be
the most profitable for the Kentucky
growers in the history of the state,
and it goes without saying that when
the facts become well known a great
ly increased acreage will be planted.
Tobacco cannot be grown in North
and South Carolina and Virginia un
less from 600 to 800 pounds of fer
tilizer is used on each acre of land.
The Danville breaks have been the
scenes of much activity this week,
and many splendid averages have
been realized. The Walnut Street
House, under the splendid manage
ment of .Jesse Overstreet and Allen
Hieatt, has been making some sensa
tional sales, as well as the People's
House, under the direction of Col.
Ike Dunn. These houses do a strict
ly commission business and the man
agers use their best energies to se
cure the biggest prices for the grow
ers. Growers are warned to use
great care in selecting their tobacco
"seed this year so that good, strong
plants may be produced. Local
warehousemen advise the planting of
seeds sold bv B. F. Kelly, of .Lancas
"fer; 2f. DLake, of Springrelu? oT
Dr. Halley, of Lexington. A change
in tobacco seed is as essential as a
change in wheat, and corn. About
one-half million pounds of tobacco
have been sold on the Danville breaks
this week. Herewith are given a few
of the high averages received:

ACCIDENT ON ICE
PROVES FATAC
Little Jesse Dunn Succumbs to In
jury to His Head Which Baf
fled Physicians.
Jesse Dunn, the 12-year-old son
of Mr. and Mrs. Owsley Dunn, died
at their home, north of Stanford,
Wednesday after several weeks suf
fering from the injury which he re
ceived when he fell on Ice while skat
ing a few weeks ago. The little fel
low's brain was affected in some way,
and at times he suffered excruciating
agony. Everything in the power of
medical science was done for him to
no avail, and death came at last and
put an end to his pain. His par
ents, have the deepest sympathy of
a host of friends in their great be
reavement. Funeral services were
conducted Friday over the remains
of the little fellow who was a great
favorite with his playmates and all
who knew him. He was in the fourth
grade at school and was doing fine in
his studies. The accident which
: caused the lad's death was a most pe
culiar one. Together with some
playmates he was skating on a pond
near his father's farm a few weeks
ago, during a cold spell. He fell
and struck the back of his head upon
a ridge of ice. For a day or so he
paid little attention to the injury, but
soon the most agonizing pains began
to develop, and physicians came to
the conclusion that some structure
of the brain had been broken by
the jar. They did what they could,
but were unable to relieve him of
suffering in any way except through
the use of opiates.
