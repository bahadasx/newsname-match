TWIN-STATE TOWNS IN CIRCUIT
Brattleboro, Bellows Falls, Northamp
ton, Plttsfield, Greenfield and
North Adams Selected.
John A. Zeller, who managed the
Plttsfield eastern association club
and John F. O'Hara, are planning to
form, a new six-club league of the
smaller towns of western Massachus
etts and southern Vermont. The new
league, it is planned, will be com
posed of teams representing Brattle
boro and Bellows Falls of the Twin
State league of last season and North
ampton, Plttsfield, Greenfield and
North Adams. The territory has been
carefully gone over by Zeller and
O'Hara and both feel confident that
all citieB are ripe for the proposed
league. A meeting will be held in
this city "within 10 days" to which
all interested parties are invited,
when further plans will be talked
ove..
The league promoters plan to oper
ate under the national agreement,
and protection will bo requested from
the national board. It is felt that a
class C rating may be allowed.
Mr. Zeller said last night that It
had been erroneously given out the
league would be a reorganized Twin
State circuit. ' That is not the idea
of Messers Zeller and O'Hara It
seems that some little hitch over cer
tain officers of last year's Twin State
circuit kept some of the four Massa
chusetts cities out of the circuit. The
proposed league will have nothing
whatsoever to do with the Twin
State circuit, but will be an entirely
ne,w one composed ol the towns men
tioned above. . , . '.. .

of Columbus Minstrel entertataiment
at Harte'l theatre, Wednesday even

It Is a pleasure to announce that af
ter much persuasion, that old time
minstrel favorite of years and years
ago, Collins Millard Graves, has con
sented to make one more farewell ap
pearance on the minstrel stage.
In the good old days the hearts of
our parents and grandparents were
gladdened by the sweet melodious
tones and happy jokes of .this old
minstrel hoy, and tradition has it
that with, a few, sweet strains of
Music' he could sway his entire audi
ence from the depths of, a , vale of
tears to the heights of joy and laugh
ter, and, it,i8 said that his voice still
retains much-of that old magnetic
power and sweetness, which we hope
and trust will never wholly pass
away. t " . -
Since retiring from the minlstrel
stage Mr. Graves' has made his home
amidst the scenes of bis childhood,
happy to pass . his , reclining years,
which will naturally' be numerous, in
his beautiful home in Gilson Park,
surrounded by a large and growing
family of big and little boys.
Mr. Graves desires us to say that
ft was with great reluctance that he
hastily consented to favor the good
people of Bennington once again, and
to please him we do so say.
In casting about his miiBlcal library
for one of the old songs, and to please
Charley Firth, who seems to be the
Only one who remembers Mr. Graves
in his best minstrel 'flays, he has fin
ally determined upon that-grand old
home and fireside melody entitled,
"They all .had a Finger in the Pie."
, Mr. Graves will be on the stage but
a.short time as he feels that he must"
conserve his strength and retire ear
ly, so it behooves al.to be on hand at
the rising, of the curtain, prepared for
a. good time. .. Adv. , . , , .

Killed on This Side of the "" '

Washington, i Feb. 17. President
Wilson sent to jthe Senate today his
response to the Fall resolution adopt
ed last month Requesting him to re
port on facts leading up to recogni
tion by the United States o fthe de
facto government of Mexico headed
by Gen. Venustiano Carranzd. It was
in the form of a, long letter from Sec
retary Lansing, summarizing the
events which preceded recognition,
and transmitting - a great volume of
data, including ia list of all Americans
killed in Mexico and along the border
during the past six years.
The President through Mr. Lansing
declined to comply with that part of
the Fall resolution asking for diplo
matic and consular reports on politi
cal conditions and events tn Mexico.
The Senate was Informed that It was
not compatible with public Interests
to furnish this correspondence inas
much as It was of a highly confidenti
al nature, and "submitted by consular
officers of the United States, by dip
lomatic or consular officers of other
governments which have graciously
consented that their officers ' might

As to the ability of. Carraffea to ful

that under all the circumstances, the

time of recfcgjjitlpn controlled, more

WANTS PROHIBITION
Eber L. Taylor Thinks It Would Be a
Step Ahead.
Editor of The Banner I under
stand you favor "letting well enough
alone" in regard to the proposed new
law prohibiting the sale of ' intoxicat
ing liquors in Vermont. As I under
stand the case this movement Is with
us, citizens of Vermont, a showing
what our sentiments are toward Na
tion Wide prohibition. When I read
the names of prominent and influent
ial Vermonters In the leaflet put out
with the heading "A Better Vermont"
I cannot think that their judgment is
so much at fault that the act passed
by the general assembly at the last
session of our legislature, is without
merit. I believe that this Country and
nation will be benefitted In just as
great a measure by prohibition as
either England or Russia and the
statesman of those countries saw fit
to decree that intoxicating liquors
should not be sold in their realms
during the war, and from what I read
tho result is highly eatisfactory.
If the measure is of so much im
portance in time of war why is it not
of equally great importance with us
in times of peace? The money spent
for strong drink is worse than wasted
and this talk about the revenue from
licenses is the most senseless kind of
poppy cock. You are In the habit of bet
ting red apples. I will bet a barrel of
red apples that every voter, who has
hitherto roted for license In Vermont
will .vote No on this question at March
meeting. If that doesn't give a good
reason why every man of temperance
principles should vote for this meas
ure, then my judgment is at fault I
believe In going ahead, not stand ellll
and let other communities lead the
way all of the time. I believe this act
is an improvement on the local option
law now in force and let us have 'Ms
ions" and try to imagine the condition
of our country in ten or twenty years,
the result of nation wide prohibi
tion. When the legislature, composed
of the best men in the state, enacted
this law and one of the most sensible
I - -
faforma-fcsvernor8 Vermont ever elected,
signea it, i am confident mat I can
not be far in the wrong when I shall
vote for Its becoming the law In Ver
mont. I notice writers declare "it
cannot be enforced," the present law
isn't enforced, the old prohibition
law wasn't enforced. Strictly speak
ing I do not expect this act. If it be
comes law. can be literary enforced,
but if it reduces the use of mmjas a
beverage, a 'reasonable per ''cent.' ! I
shall-be satisfied. i'. 'J"J 1 - ' " )
,v,We talk- abont taking away a roan's

himself" har-nj and, we declare positive
ly that 'lie has no right to act In such
ha way that others may suffer from
tils actions.1 If we have' beneficial
laws and then we fail to elect men
who are qualified and capable of exe
cuting those laws that is no fault of
the law.
I fail to see any force to the argu
ment that "the present law is good
enough." It looks to me as though
the liquor interests realize that this
act would draw the lines a little
tighter ' and consequently ' they
are anxious to hold all they have
now and as the case is
at present,
they see their influence' slipping away
from thefn:' ' I could not consistently

GREAT BRITIAN WORST OFFENDER
United States Will Protest - to Allied
Nations Against Seizure of
Securities In Transit
Washington Feb. 17. Another
note from Sweden has been addressed
to the State Department through Min
ister Ekengren, appealing to the
United States for co-operation with
the Swedish government and other
neutral nations, to maintain the pres
ervation of rules of International law
concerning the protection of neutral
commerce and navigation. Action Js
proposed particularly against. Great
Britain because of the detention of
mail by that country and other ag
gressions against trade ' which are
regarded by Sweden as unwarranted.
Secretary Lansing informed the
minister, it was learned todaythat ho
could not answer the note until the .
controversy with Germany over the
Lusitanla case was settled. .
This latest communication, address
ed to Secretary Lansing and signed
by Mr. Ekengren, was presented re

A Device Of Satan
Alexander Wells, an old citizen of
Wellsville, O., has a copy of an Inter
esting and novel document issued by
the school board of the town of Lan
caster, O., in 1828. The question of
steam railroads was in its incipient
stage and a club of young men had
been formed for the purpose of dis
cussing the point at issue. They de
sired to use the schoolhouse for the
purposes of debate. This was looked
upon by the members of the school
board as an innovation bordering up
on sacrilege, as indicated, which is the
document in the possession of Mr.
Wells. It reads as follows:
.. "You are welcome to the use of the
schoolhouse to debate all proper ques
tions in, but such things as railroads
and telegraphs are Impossibilities and
rank infidelity. There Is nothing In
the Word of God about them.' If God
had designed that his . intelligent
creatures should travel at the fright
ful speed of fifteen miles an hour, by
steam he would clearly have foretold
it- through his holy prophets.- t. is a
device of Satan to lead immortal souls
to hell." ;
Such Bentlments possibly reflected,
the feeling, to some extent, in the days
of sixty-five years ago, but they sound
strange at the present time, when the
"device of Satan" is carrying people
over the land at the rate
of sixty or Beventy miles an hour. i
