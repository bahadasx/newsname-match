GRANGE MAY EXPEL
WEST FOR SLANDER
COMMITTEE IS REPORTED TO
HAVE RECOMMENDED SUCH
ACTION TO POMONA.
Members of the Thurston County
Pomona Grange, at their March
meeting at the South Bay Grange
hall, will vote upon the recommenda
tion it is reported was made to the
February meeting in this city last
Tuesday, that A. G. West, former
master of Brighton Park Grange and
supervisor of Road District No. 6,
be expelled from the order, the rec
ommendation coming from the com
mittee which recently heard the
charges that West had maliciously
slandered former County Agent O. C.
Van Houten, also a Grange member,
during the recent campaign involving
that office.
The report was submitted at a
cloßed session of the Pomona Grange
and no official statement as to the
recommendation is forthcoming, al
though reports after the meeting
agreed that the committee proposed
West should be expelled. The
Grange riles provide that both West
and Van Houten be notified of the
committee's recommendation and
given another hearing at the next Po
mona meeting, before final action is
taken.
Had to Postpone Trip.
The meeting last Tuesday was to
have been held in the new hall of the
Skookumchuck Grange, southwest of
Tenino, but the Grangers were un
able to make the trip there on ac
count of the condition of the roads.
The meeting was therefore held in
Olympla and was attended by some
50 farmers, representing the Alert,
Boulevard, Brighton Park, Cham
bers' Prairie, Pleasant Glade, Spur
geon Creek and South Bay subordi
nates.
One of the features of the day'a
meeting was the presentation of a
past master's Jewel to H. P. Briggs
as a token of his work for the Po
mona during the five years he was
master. The presentation was made
by the present master, L. L. Snow,
who was elected last month when
Briggs declined to accept the office
again this year.
Three Resolutions Adopted.
Among the resolutions adopted was
one favoring rural credit legislation
by congress, one favoring closer rela
tions and co-operation between the
Pomona and the trades unions of the
county, as the State Orange and State
Federation of Labor co-operate, and
one renewing the protest voiced at
the January meeting to Congressman
Johnson's scheme to get money for
building a road along the Olympic
peninsula.
In connection with this latter sub
ject, the Pomona had Johnson's ex
planation of the plan, to the effect
that only four counties instead of 29
would be affected, but renewed the
protest on the ground that Johnson's
plan would rob Mason county of both
its school and highway funds drawn
from the forest reserves, and would
give it no part of the proposed high
way. while in the other three penin
sulnr counties the school funds would
be depleted and the money would all
go to a special road instead of the
general road fund.
GILLIES CASE CLOSING.
Motion to Dismiss Being Denied, De
fense Begins Submitting Evidence.
With the denial Thursday noon by
Superior Judge Wright of the motion
to dismiss the charge, offered by At
torney Thos, M. Vance on behalf of
J. F. Gillies, the task of presenting
testimony for the defense in the sec
ond trial of Gillies in connection with
the Industrial insurance frauds, this
time for grand larceny, was begun
Thursday afternoon.
The state rested its case Thursday
morning and, the Jury being retired,
arguments were Immediately begun
on the defense's motion to dismiss
the case. These occupied the entire
morning. The evidence to be sub
mitted by the defense will probably
be completed by some time Friday,
so that the case will be in the hands
of the jury Saturday.
The eviditoce offered by the prose
cution in this second trial is very
similar to that of the first, as the re
sult of which Gillies was convicted
of forgery.

FOUR INITIATIVE
BILLS ARE FILED
NON-PARTISAN ELECTIONS, HOME
RULE. FIRST AID AND FISH
ERIES LAWS PROPOSED.
Four initiative measures, the first
proposed this year, were filed with
Secretary of State Howell this week
by Miss Lucy Case, secretary of the
joint legislative committee of three
organizations—the State Orange, the
State Federation of Labor and the
Direct Legislation League.
The bills are:
A non-partisan primary and elec
tion bill.
A home rule bill, proposing the
abolition of state regulation of public
utilities.
A first aid bill, as an adjunct to the
workmen's compensation law,
A fisheries code, proposing a grad
uated scale of taxation on fish caught
in the state.
Of these the first aid bill and the
fish bill were defeated in the fall elec
tion of IHI4. The new measures pro
posed, however, offer some variations
from the ones defeated.
The non-partisan election bill pro
poses to do away with party politics
in the state. It provides for prefer
ential presidential primaries in May
of presidential years, and for Septem
ber primaries and fall elections, all
candidates to be without party desig
nation.
Second Choice Voting Optional.
The measure has a section making
the voting of the second choice pro
vision optional instead of compul
sory, as it is under the present law
It provides for elimination of par
ties in state and county elections and
primaries, but parties are retained
for congressional offices, which in
clude United States senators and rep
resentatives, and for party com
mitteemen and delegates to the na
tional conventions. Delegates to the
national contentions are to be elect
ed at the May presidential primaries.
The party committeemen meet one
week after the September primary,
draft a national platform and choose
presidential electors whose names
shall go on the November ballot.
Fifty days before the primaries
parties shall filed a petition with the
secretary of state setting forth their
principles. This so-called platform
must be signed by 1 per cent of the
vote at the preceding election. An
organisation may be designated as a
party under the act if one of its can
didates received 3 per cent of the
vote cast at the previous election, or
if the combined vote of its candidate?
for congress was more than 3 per
cent of the total vote.
The filing fee for candidates shall

Did you ever sign a contract like
the above? You probably did if you

that our solicitors called on during
the last five years, for a big percent

cities we "worked" promptly put
their name on the dotted line.
The special edition referred to,
when it appeared, consisted solely of
from 12 to 24 pages of solid reading
matter loudly proclaiming the virtue,
the progressiveness, the enterprise,
the honesty, the aggressiveness, etc.,
of every merchant who could be in
duced to order anywhere from 25 to
500 copies of the special edition. It
also contained several illustrations
and a stereotyped review of the city

that were out of date.

the value or the worthlessness of the

at my discomfiture and you may rest

NEXT WEEK IS
PAY-VP WEEK ALL
OVER UNITED STATES
With nearly 100 merchants co
operating, Olympia, along with
many other cities in the state of
Washington and throughout the
United States will celebrate Pay-
Up Week from next Monday until
next Saturday, the object being to
persuade as many people as pos
sible to pay as many bills as pos
sible, so that more money will be
put into circulation. "Let's pass
prosperity around" is the slogan
for the week.
The objects of the campaign and
and the merchants and firms par
ticipating in it are set forth on
another page of this issue, while
bulletin boards, telephone poles,
and billboards scattered through
out the city are plastered with
placards emphasizing the Pay-Up
Week idea. Every package that
has gone out of an Olympia store
during the past week, also, has
borne upon it somewhere a pretty
little Pay-Up Week poster stamp,
while special letters have been
written, enclosing statements of
accounts, and in each of these
have been the poster stamps and
special literature regarding the
campaign.
From an educational stand
point, educational in that it tends
to reduce the abuse of credit, as
well as in the amount of money
that will be put into circulation
here next week, local merchants
expect Pay-Up Week to be a big
success. The campaign has been
given more publicity than any re
cently undertaken by the mer
chants, all have co-operated heart
ily in the work and the Pay-Up
Week idea has been popularized
to such an extent that everyone
in the city and cour.ty now knows
the objects and purposes of it un
til the people generally have
caught the spirit of the campaign
with that enthusiasm which as
sures its success.
mitted, "I do like to see my name in
print."
The special edition man is a firm
believer in the old maxim that
"There's one born every minute," and
that is the reason why the souvenir
edition publisher, or the special
edition man, or the publicity repre
sentative or the town booster or
whatever title he may possess, thrives
and A-ill continue to thrive. His
work is becoming more difficult, how
ever, for of late years most retail
firms have organized local commer
cial bodies, and it is frequently the
rule that any advertising solicitor
must first secure the indorsement of
this body. Then, too, the merchant
is apt to remember past experiences,
and when approached he may state
that "The paper got out such an edi
tion last year. I was in it, too, but
I can't see where it did me any good."
ETCH Chambers of Commerce Help.
The fact that the solicitor must
first obtain permission from the sec
retary of the local Chamber of Com
merce or of some commercial organi
zatim did not prove detrimental to
our work. For instance, in Belling
ham, Wash., we anticipated the sec
retary's objection. So we prepared
a brief description of the city and
its advantages and took it in person
to him. We told him we were going
to publish a booklet and asked him
kindly to correct the article as to

COMPLETE PROBE
IS TO BE MADE,
GOVERNOR SAYS
"In regard to the article in a
Seattle weekly paper accusing me
of irregularities in my expense ac
count, the matter is now in the
hands of Mr. Claussen, state audi
tor, who is making an investiga
tion. Until he is ready to make
his report 1 have no statement to
make except that I have not de
frauded the state out of one single
cent."
This was the emphatic com
ment made this week by Chair
man Floyd L. Daggett of the in
dustrial insurance commission,
prompted by allegations made by
a Republican newspaper last week
that he had "padded" his ex
pense accounts. Governor Lister
also issued a statement saying
that a full and complete investi
gation of the department would
be made, and that it "will not stop
with the conviction of those re
sponsible for the issuance of the
fraudulent claims. Every line
wherein there is or may possibly
have been a violation of the law,
will be investigated."
Then, after pointing out that
the department vouchers are
audited and approved by the state
auditor, that the bureau of in
spection is charged with the ex
amination of the state offices, and
that such an examination is in
progress, he added:
"I may say also that in addi
tion to this investigation the at
torney general and myself intend
to continue the investigation until
we are satisfied everything that
may be wrong or in violation of
the law will have been discov
ered."

HUM PERMITS USE If
■S DUE IS EMMIE
President Formally Consents So Ohio
Supporters May Declare for
Him at Primaries.
For the first time President Wil
son formally consented this week to
the use of his name as a presidential
candidate in the coming campaign,
though at the same time he declared
he "was entirely unwilling to enter
into any contest" for renomination.
Mr. Wilson's declaration was made
in a letter to the Ohio secretary of
state, who had written that candi
dates for delegates from that state
to the national convention must sig
nify choices for president by Febru
ary 25, and that no presidential can
didates could be named in that con
nection without their consent.
In several other states in which
no such requirements are imposed,
Mr. Wilson's name already has been
placed on primary ballots, and his
friends generally have taken it for
granted that he would be a candi
date if convinced there was any con
siderable popular demand for it. In
a letter written before his inaugura
tion to A. Mitchell Palmer, then a
representative from Pennsylvania,
Mr. Wilson made it plain that he
would be a candidate again only in
case Democratic voters desired it.
SHS STATE SHOULD

MRS. A. E. SHELDON WOULD EN
TIRELY ABOLISH PRESENT
COMPETITIVE SYSTEM.
Editor Standard:
In your editorial of February 4th
issue you invite discussion of the sub
ject under consideration from the
constructive side. At the risk of a
threadbare welcome I beg leave to
give my views from this standpoint.
An iconoclast who is not also a
builder has little to recommend him,
or her, but we must begin with the
foundation if the structure is to
stand; to me this seems to be, "The
greatest good to the greatest num
ber."
Mr. Rogers well says, "that selfish
ness is largely the root of existing
evils," yet it may also be the source
of the greatest good. The acme of
selfishness may be that which seeks
the good of all as a means to the
greatest individual welfare, but it is
a selfishness we all must learn. I
believe this "greatest good" can best
be brought about by the complete
abolishment of the whole competi
tive system.
i Big business finds its strength in
combination, not competition. When
our local business men work together
to overcome their troubles it is co
operation, not competition; but when
business men combine to fix the price
of the farmer's products and leave
him out of the reckoning it is not co
operation with the farmer.
Here is where the farmer falls
down hardest, and here, also, is
j where business and the farmer can
never agree, for the making of prices
I is claimed by business as its exclu
; sive right which it will not surrender
I without a struggle.
I agree that "if the average mer
! chant would run his business the way
' the average farmer runs his farm he
would go broke in sixty days," but
I would add that if the average busi
ness man would run his own business
as he advises the farmer to run his
he would go broke in half that time,
i Stimulating Production.
If it is "folly to stimulate produc
tion beyond the market's demand,"
why does the Chamber of Commerce
bob up several times a year with a
brand-new plan for "more and bet
ter" this and that? "More and bet
ter" dairy stock with the price of
butter-fat lower than at this time in
years? "The Potato club wants to
include in its marketing plans all
the acreage it can get." If other
clubs are doing the same, what will
be the result? Yet. as I understand
it, the organizer and director of the
aforesaid club is not a farmer,

TIONED TO SUCCEED LINDLEY
M. GARRISON.
Colonel Ooethals, builder of the
Panama canal, Secretary of the Inte
rior Lane, Newton D. Baker, former
mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, Jadson
Harmon, former governor of Ohlow
H. M. Pindell of Illinois, Ambassador
Morganthau, Counsellor Polk of th»
state department and Carter Har
rison, former mayor of Chicago, are
among the prominent persons who
have been mentioned this week as
successors to Lindley M. Garrison,
who resigned the. portfolio of secre
tary of war in President Wilson's
cabinet the latter part of last week-
No intimation has yet been given
by the president as to the appointee,
though it had been expected Gar
rison's successor would have been
chosen by this time. It is reported
from Washington that the president
lis considering the qualifications of
all likely candidates with the view of
selecting one familiar with the duties
of the department, and that the ap
pointment will be made on the basis
of fitness and not of politics.
The resignation of Garrison and
Breckenridge was announced the lat
ter part of last week and came as •
complete surprise to official Wash
ington generally. Upon the contend
tlon by Garrison that the continental
army or eventually universal service
was the nation's only reliance, and
the position taken by the president
that no one plan could be enforced
upon congress, President Wilson and
his secretary of war parted official
company.
Far from putting the administra
tion "In the hole," Garrison's resign**
tlon has had far-reaching res alts oir
Ccongress. When the excitement fol
lowing the unexpected development
subsided it was apparent that it had
clarified the atmosphere with regard
to national defense and Philippine
Independence and had served to bring
congress and the president closer to
gether than they had been for many
months.
Evidence of the fact that Garrison's
withdrawal had served to cement the
bonds of sympathy between congress
and the president came in the adop
tion by the house military affair*
committee of a resolution, proposed
by the ranking Republican member.
Representative Katan of California,
thanking the president for his ex
pression of confidence in congress
disclosed in his correspondence with
Garrison. It also was demonstrated
in comments of many senators and
representatives, who declared they
saw in President Wilson's determina
tion not to stand irrevocably for any
one plan of creating an army reserve
a purpose to place more reliance in
the Judgment of the legislative
branch of the government than he
had in the past.
It is known that one of Secretary
Garrison's principal reasons for his
conviction that only a federal conti
nental army, instead of a reorganised
national guard, could be the main
military dependence of the nation
was hiß belief that some day the
United States may be called upon to
defend the Monroe doctrine, and in
that event he foresaw the national
guard might not be available for use
outside of the United States before a
declaration of war. Members of con
gress, however, believe that body has
the constitutional authority to feder
alise the national guard in such •
way that it will be immediately avail
able, and both houses of congress are
now working on such a plan.
The difference of opinion which led
to the break between the president
and Garrison began early In the year
when opposition to the continental
army plan began developing in con
gress. The circumstances which led
up to the resignation are detailed in
the secretary's correspondence with
the president, which was made public
recently by the White House. The
president, the letters disclose, be
lieves that the training, organization
and control of a military reserve
should be under immediate federal
direction, but is not "irrevocably or
dogmatically committed to any one
plan." He wrote Mr. Garrison that
