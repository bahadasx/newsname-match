There is a Real Difference
Cream of tartar, derived from grapes,
; is used in Royal Baking Powder because
it is the best and most healthful ingredient
- known for the purpose.
Phosphate and alum, which are de-
rived from mineral sources, are used in
; some baking powders, instead of cream of
tartar, because they are cheaper.
If you have been induced to use baking
powders made from alum or phosphate,
use Royal Baking Powder instead. You
will be pleased with the results and the
difference in the quality of the food.
