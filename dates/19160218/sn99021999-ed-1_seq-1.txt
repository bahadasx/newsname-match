COMPARATIVE FIGURES GIVEN

Slain in Period Pre

WASHINGTON. Feb. 17. All of
the State department's data on the
Mexican situation, asked for by Sen
ator Fall, was transmitted to the
senate today by President Wilson.
On motion of Chairman Stone of the
foreign relations committee it was
ordered printed as a public docu
ment. It had been expected that
some of it would be held confiden
tial. In a letter from Secretary Lansing,
accompanying the report, .it is said
that seventy -six American citizens
were killed In Mexico in the years
1913, 1914 and 1916. as against
forty-seven In the three years pre
ceding it. and that twenty-six civilian
Americans and sixteen soldiers were
killed on American soil in the same
three years as a result of Mexican
troubles.
In describing the Carranza gov
ernment, Secretary Lansing wrote in
the report:
"It cannot he said that the defacto

Referring to the efforts of the recent
Pan-American conference to get Mexican
factions together. Secretary Lansing
wrote:
"The attempt to bring the factiona to
gether for a conference failed. On the
oee hand there seemed Jo be no central
organisation among the Villlata. forcea.
while on the other band, submission to
the central. authority wai evidenced in
the replies ot the CarrunsloUs. The unity
and loyalty of the Carransistas appeared
to indicate the ultimate triumph of that
faction.".
der along the Mexican border was grad
ually being reatored. . The-report slated
that it would be incompatible with the
public Interest to disclose correspondence
between the United States and the Bra
slllan minister at Mexico City, who acted
for the United States, and also the cor
respondence with representatives of this
government In Mexico.

Stockholm Sends Another Note Seek

LANSING WILL NOT ACT YET
Says He Won't Answer Communica

Settled.
COMPLAINT OF MAIL HELD UP
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17. An
other note from Sweden has been ad
dressed to the State department,
through Minister Ekengrln, appeal
ing to the United States for co-operation
with the Swedish govern
ment and other neutral nations to
maintain the preservation ot rules of
International law concerning the
protection of neutral commerce and
navigation. Action Is proposed par
ticularly against Great Britain be
cause of the detention of mail by
that country and other aggressions
against trade regarded by Sweden as
unwarranted.
Secretary Lansing informed the
minister, it wss learned today,, that
he could not answer the note until
the controversy with Germany over
the Lusitania csbo was settled .
This latest communit atlon, addressed to
Secretary Lansing and signed by Mr.
Ekengren, was presented recently after
such a proposal had ben advanced anJ
discussed from time to time, but until
today the fact did not become known.
Text of Note.
Following is the text of the note:
I have .been Instructed by his excellency,
the minister for foreign affairs at Block
holm to address the following to your
excellency:
"The royal government lias, during the
present wsr, from time to maintain and
preserve certain Important rules of inter
national war, which concern protection
of neutral commerce and navigation, ant
which are being violated by Great Bri
tain. .
"The violation of , existing rules or
International law has, regardless of pro
tests, increased until at preaent only a
few rules, serving as protection to neu
tral commercial Intercourse, are observed
by Great Brits In and It Is feared that
also these remaining few will be violated.
- His majesty's government 4 which ia
deeply conscious of Its responsibility, to
not omit any measure- tending tf prevent
auqhv an. eveutuallty end wl -aware ,jf
the danger lor the future ir these ruies,
wbloh are cf Infinite worth to civilisation
as a whole, are not preserved, des'res. to
herewith make jl renewed presentation
to your excellency, in this respect
Have. Violated Mall -Traffic.
'Of late the Brltinh authorities have
violated the mall ' txnfftc. Parcel post
from one neutral country to snother Is
being unloaded In British ports and the
contents are being seised. While parcel
Is not protected through The Hague
postal convention, it, nevertheless, seems
to his majesty's government that the
British procedure, in the form and ex
tensiveness practiced, would be Invalid
even with regsrd to ordinary express
goods, snd that' this seems particularly
evident when the seisure of parcel post
Is directed against j. means of convey
ance . under guarantee of sovereign
powers. Besides, grunt personal Incon
venience Is connected with seisure of this
kind.
"However, England's present practice
of cenaor.lng also fiiat-class mall,' sent
by neutral vessels from one neutral coun
try to another, is an even greater viola
tion of the rights accorded neutral powers
by the rules of international law. -It is
necessary to particularly point out how
contrary this practice. Is to the stipula
tions in the above mentioned Hague con
vention, which stipulations or rules must
be considered to have been in existence
even before the promulgation of this con
vention.
appeal for Co-operation,
"The roysl government, therefore, sp
peals to the government of the United
States for co-operatlou. for the purpose
of seeking to bring about a discontinue
tlon of the violations of international law.
at leaat so far as the same concerns first
class mall, and It solicits as early an
snswer as possible whether your excel
lency Is willing to take appropriate action
In co-operation with the royal govern
ment and eventually the governments of
other neutral countries for the purpose
of causing that the nne which the ques
tion Involves and which is one of tb
fundamental stipulations of International
law be observed."

NEW YORK, Feb. IT The government

New Tork bankers, who estimate that
175.008,000 of Greek funds are now on de

This action Is regarded by bankers as
a precautionary move In case of a break

Kaiser's Position Well Founded, but
U. S. Insists Rules Cannot Bo

SETTLEMENT IS PROBABLE SOON
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17, Secre
tary Lansing said late today that the
United S'ates wouldr accept nothing
short of a full and complete agree
ment, in. the submarine controversy
with Germany covering the pointa
for which it has contended as to tha
past and assurances for the future.
Secretary Lansing said the United
States considered the announcement
ot the new submarine campaign in
consistent with assurances previ
ously given and that tha United
States considered a merchant ship
with defensive armament and one
without guns all In tbe same class.
Assurances were wanted, he said, to
extend Immunity from "linera" to all
merchant ships.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17, Secre
tary Ianslng today accepted tha
Lusitania agreement as satisfactory
to the United Statea insofar aa It
relates to that rase, but asked Count
Von Bernstorff, the German amas
anuur, ror assurances that Germany
will not carry out Us policy of sink
ing merchant ships without warning
to liners, even If tbey carry defen
sive armament.
Tha question of what constitutes
defensive armament is to be deter
mined later in a way not yet agreed
upon. It Is suggested that tha
United States may propose that guna
mounted oc the stern of ehlpa and
capable of being swung from fif
teen to thirty degrees In either di
rection might come withta that
class.
It was stated authoritatively that Ger
many, because ot its- unusual position,
cannot and will, not accept the suggestion
ot the United States ss it now star.de
that liners carrying arras shall be immune
from attack under previous assurances.
Caaaot rhaagro Ir Nw. .
Secretary Lansing is understood to have
told the ambassador that while Qtrmui'i
position Is recognised ss well founded the
I nlted States must Insist that Oennsnv
couform all its practices to International
law. Inasmuch as the entente allies have
declined to make any changes.
The Lulstanta acreement will H fc.n
by Becretary Umslng and later will
published with the assuranoes which the
united Slates hopes to receive from Ger
many covering the points brought up by
tho new submarine campaign.
Meanwhile It waa aald the United
would make efforts to have the entente
allies agree not to out a-uns of in, kind
on passenger carrying liners.
Ambaaaador Von Bernstorff when ha
returned to his embassy sent a long dis
patch to his government setting forth
fully the position of the United Statea
as the secretary had outlined It to him
