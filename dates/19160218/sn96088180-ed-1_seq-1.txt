The matter of a restricted district for

Osslnlng, N. Y., Feb. 18. Hans
Schmidt gave his life In tho electric
chair here at dawn today for the

mueller. He went to death as calmly
as be would have conducted religious
services In the days when he mas

words were for his old mother in
Germany. Down the dark chambers
of the death row sounded his good
byes to 20 other condemned men as
he vanlsned out through the "little
green door" on his last Journey.
Father .Cashln, prison chaplain,
who had prayed with .him through
the night hours, accompanied him to
the chair. Both the chaplain and
the guards were surprised at the con
demned man's haste. Disregarding
the usual measured tread of the dead
march, Schmidt, erect and unfalter

calm and collected.

The witnesses, In breathless ex

rang sharp and clear in the little
room:

Senator Lodge Tells Seixte
His Idea of tie Geriiki.
and Austrian Scheme cf
Attack cn MercH Ships
Washington, Feb. 18. -Austria and
Germany were charged by Senator
Lodge of Massachusetts today with
proposing piracy in their plans to
attack armed merchant vessels with
out warning.
Discussing the Sterling resolution
against recognition of their plans,
Lodge said it Is Inconceivable that
the United States would accept the
Teutonic decree. ,. He cited precedent
to show that arming of merchant
ships for defense had been allowed
since the days of the Barbery pirates.
He recalled that America had ap
proved such armament during the
present war, and declared that any
change from this position now would
be an unneutral act.
"The abandonment of the right of
merchantmen to arm themselves or
the right ot Americans to travel or
ship their goods on them," said
Lodge, "could rest only on the
ground that the centurles-old right
ot neutrals mast be coat aside so that
a new Instrument ot maritime de
struction should not be Impeded In
Its work of death and murder. ; 8nch
a doctrine to revolting; to. every In
stinct of humanity and to every prin
ciple of law and Justice."
Re said abandonment of the pre
sent system would be a warlike step
against the allies which at the same
time .would make, thp United States
Germany's ally.,
Senator Sterling, who introduced
the resolution several days ago, fol
lowed Lodge. . -v- fV
Denouncing the Teuton decree as
a reversion to the ldeaa of the Dark
Ages and . as creating a sltnation
which constitutes "our gravest Inter
national crisis," Sterling declared:
"Let another sea horror occur In
which Americans are Involved and
the administration and the world will
know that there is a. real America,
not supine, not apathetic and hesi
tating, but strong and militant"
Referring to the Lusitanla case.
Sterling said that the administration
"at first appeared bold and uncom
promising in behalf ot Feat Prln"
ciple, but In the end yielded the sub
stance for the word. ' " r
"The vice in the state department's
suggestion that the allies disarm
merchant vessels," said Sterling, "lies
In the. idea that. because the deadly
submarine is not strong on defense
ltseir, we must maKe mercnant snips
helpless "against It." i i ;.
Sterling urged Issuance ot a very
strong, protest to Germany against
her new plans. . 1 - i , .," '
Following . Lodge and Sterling,
Senator Thomas read Into the record
recent reports that the administration
intends no approval of the decree, as
the two previous speakers suggested.
He charged that the republican at
tacks were for nolltical effect and
were not 'based on facts nor upon a
sincere desire to better the diplomatic
relations of the nation. . u
