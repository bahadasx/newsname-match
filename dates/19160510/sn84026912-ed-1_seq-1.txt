MEXICANS MAKE ANOTHER RAID
Three Troopers Killed and Several
Wounded in Surprise Autark.
El Paso, Texas, May 7.-Three
American soldiers and a ten-year-old
boy have lost their lives and two
American citizens have been kidnap
ped and carried south of the interna
tional boundary to almost certain
death in another raid of Mexican
bandits that takes rank with Francis
co Villa's- famous attack on Colum
bus, N. M. Whether the marauders
were Villa bandits or Carranza forces
is not known.
The bandits' foray, carrying them
through the southern limits of Brew
ster county in the Big Bend district
of Texas, and taking in three little
settlements near the border-Glenn
Springs, Boquillas and Deemers
took place on Friday night and Satur
day morning, but news of lt did not
reach here until to-day.
The detachment of American sold
iers forming the patrol at Clean
Springs was almost destroyed. Three
of the soldiers were killed and live
wounded.
U. S. Troops in Pursuit.
Within an hour preparations had
been.begun for adequate action. Ma
jor Gen. Funston ordered that four
troops of cavalry should proceed to
the raided districts to reinforce small
detachments already on their way to
the scene from Presidio, Alpine and
other points.
These troops got under way to
night, lt is said here that if the exi
gencies of the case demand such ac
tion they will cross the border in or
der to run down and disperse the
bandits.
The two detachments are expected
to detrain to-morrow morning-Ma
jor Langhorne's at Alpine, and Col.
Sibley's at Marathon. From these
points they will march 90 miles to
the border.
Scott and Obregon Discuss Raid.
While military events were devel
oping with such rapidity the confer
ence over the co-operation of Ameri
can and Mexican soldiers in Mexico
which had been expected to reach a
culmination to-day came to an abrupt
halt.
Gens. Scott and Funston met Gen.
Obregon at Juan Immigration station
at the American end of the Interna
tional bridge shortly after ll o'clock
this morning for what had been ex
pected to be their final conference, lt
developed later, however, that practi
cally the only matter discussed was
the bandit raid at Glenn Springs.
What was said at the meeting was
not divulged. Immediately after
ward Gen. Obregon and Secretary
Amador hurried to Juarez, where
they entered Gen. Obregon's private
car and began a conference which
lasted three hours.
To-night Gen. Obregon was in tele
graphic communication with Gen.
Carranza, and it was understood he
was acquainting the first chief with
the new developments and suggesting
action that would have to be taken.
Details of the Raid.
Practically all the details of the
raid reaching here to-day came to
Gen. Funston from Major O.B. Meyer,
of the 14th cavalry, stationed at
Marfa. According to Major Meyer,
the bandits, about 7 5 in number,
crossed the Rio Grande late Friday
afternoon at a point south of Ter
lingua, Texas, where there is a guard
of about 30 men.
From there they proceeded east
ward through the desolate reaches of
the Big Bend country over an old
wagon road toward Glenn Springs, a
small ranch settlement.
A few miles west of Glenn Springs
an American party of eight men
from Troop A of tho 14th cavalry,
under command of Sergt. Smith, was
stationed. The bandits began an at
tack on the little temporary shack In
which the eight troopers woro quar
tered before the single sentinel could
raise an alarm. The Gmo was about
ll o'clock.
The attackers rushed toward the
shack shouting "Viva Villa," and
"Viva Carranza." They were met by
a sturdy del ease from tho half
asleep Americans, however, and fail
ed in their evident attempt to make
a quick capturo of the patrol guard.
Fought M ev lea ns for Hours.
From ll o'clock that night until
after 2 o'clock in the morning Sergt.
Smith fought the Mexicans from the
shelter of the patrol house. In that
time three of his men, Privates Co
hen, Coloe and Rogers, had been kill
ed and he and all the rest were
wounded. Then the shack caught
Uro.
It was Impossible to stay longer,
BO Sergt. Smith ordered a retreat.

Story of tho Raid.
Compton, whose little son Garnett
was riddled with bullets in the raid,
told how the Mexicans surrounded
the little settlement with the appar
ent object of killing all the soldiers
and then sacking the place at their
leisure.
"I heard the sound of many feet
upon the rocks," said Compton, "and
then two Mexicans with handker
chiefs tied across their faces stuck
their heads in the front door and
asked if any soldiers were there. I
answered them and looked out and
saw Mexicans coming in all direc
l,Uom?; yelling as lou di y as they
could,
"They opened fire on tho adobe
bouse and I went and got my rifle
and counted my cartridges. 1 had
only a hundred. Sitting at tho win
dow, 1 waited for them to attack.
"My eight-year-old girl Louise,
with her two brothers, Howard and
Garnett, tumbled out of bed. Louise
put her arms around my neck and
said she was afraid. I picked her
up, and, Heaving the two boys be
hind, carried her out of the back
door to the shack of a Mexican wash
erwoman, who took care of her.
"I started back to the house to
get Garnett and 'Howard. Garnett
was only four and his brother six
years old. But I could not make it.
The Mexicans wore too thick, and I
could not shoot my way through
them. I emptied my gun, but they
crowded me and I had to head away
to the creek and slip behind a rock.
In the morning I found Tyree, with
his feet and arms burned, wandering
in the creek bottom."
