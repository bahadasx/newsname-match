Paris, May 9.-The latest offensive of

failed. according to the French official
statement issued late tonight.
This attack. one of the most desperate
and powerful yet made. began on Sunday
simultaneously on both sides of the
Meuse, then shifted to and contralised
on the west. The great German aim was
to smash the Hill 304-Deadman Hill line.
The assault here ulminated in the ad
vance on Monday night and Tuesday
morning of three tremendous bodies of
German infantry. One was throwr
against the trenches northeast of Hill
:4; the seond against the French posi
tions on hill , about a mile and a halt
to the west, and the third against the
woods of .Avoco irt, a mile further to the
southwest. The attack on 11111 304 was
made at 3 o'clock this morning, the
others followed in quick succession. and
all three, it is officially reported. were
,rushed by the French artillery fire, and
to the Germans resulted only in very se
rious losses.

the Germans against a trench west of
Hill No. 3P was stopped short by our

So far as the German Embassy is con

submarine warfare is now a closed book.
The embassy is said to believe that Pres
ident Wilson's note was not calculated
to affect the situation one way or an
other, but was primarily intended for
placing the President on record before the
American people.
It is also believed by embassy officials
that the Lusitania case will be closed at

El Paso. May 9.-The Obregon-Scott
conference was unexpectedly renewed at
the suggestion of Mexican Minister of
War Obregon this evening in an effort
to prevent immediate hostilities between
the military forces of the Carranza gov
ernment and the United States.
The conferees were together three hours
and thirty minutes. At the conclusion of
the meeting Gen. Scott announced there
would probably be another meeting to
morrow. To counteract the false report
that Mondays meeting ended with ex
preesiona of bitterness on both rides and
an ultimatum from Obregon. ten. Scott
invited the Mexican official to remain for
dinner at the private car. The invitation
was accepted.
Notwithstanding this new move, indi
cative of peace, an authoritative state
ment was obtained that the punitive es
pedition and such additional forch as
may be required will remain in Northern
Mexico until outrages have been avenged
and order is restored.
The orders received by Gen. Funaton

that Gen. Trevino had concentrated 13.000

against a surprise attack. The plan to
