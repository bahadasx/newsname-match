outnumbered by ten to one, gave or

On the dash from their tent Smith

TO RAISE THREE TIMES
AMOUNT FIR8T FIXED.
Big Maw Meeting Held in Interest of
Enterprise More Than Half of
Capital Has Already Been Subscrib?

Orangeburg, May 6.?An enthusias?
tic meeting of representative business
men and farmers of this section was
held at the court house today to con?
sider the matter of increasing the cap?
ital stock of the packing house to be
established here from $50,000 to $150,
000.' The committee of fifteen men
appointed some time ago to solicit
subscriptions to the stock reported
that they had met with success on ev?
ery hand and recommended that the
rapltal he Increased to $150,000. Fol?
lowing this Robert lade and James M.
Albergottl spoke In very favorable
terms, showing the advantages of a
well equipped plant of this kind to
the community, pr. W. W. Long, of
the department of agriculture, made
an' address; which was very interest?
ing, and contained several reasons
why such a plant should be establish -
led. - He said that there are more hogs
I within a radius of seventy miles from
Orangeburg than In any other section
of the State. This statement is based
on an actual census taken to ascertain
Just what amount of stock would be
available tor the use of the plant. Dr.
Long also stated that freight rates
are very favorable. In short. It Is
hie opinion that Orangeburg is the
logical location for the packing plant.
J. W. Drehr, of Moultrle, Qa.; was
present and ssade an address, telling
of the success the plant at Moultrle

the kind in the South.
When subscriptions 'ere called for
many former subscribers multiplied
their subacHptiona, and withm a very
short time about $15,000 additional

remainder, wm hs subscribed in a
short .time. So confident are the pro?
moters that. the committee has been
instructed to apply for a charter and
proceed.to make the necessary, ar?
rangements for .the organisation of
the stock company. As soon as these
are completed preparations will be
made for the erection of the plant so
as to wests no time in getting ready

For three long hours ths fight went
on. "Just a little while more, boys,
and daylight will be with us," urged
Smith, who knew the bandits would
. retreat once they became good targets
in Ute light of dawn. ; \ l
The Mexicans fought In skirmish
formation. That was proof to Smith's
eyas that he was dealing with a mili?
tary body. The attackers' horses were
tethered some distance to the rear
and ,the brigands maintained their at?
tacks on three sides of the house,
from which there was no escape ex?
cept the door and the single window.
Unable to route the Americans from
their mud-walled fort, the' leader of
the Mexicn band gave orders to
throw fire balls on the roof
"I can't stand it any longer," cried
Private William Cohen when the
biasing thatch began falling. "I'll take
another shot and then try and mako It
through the window."
Cohen leaped into the window
frame to mako his dash for tho open.
A bullet split his skull and he fell
back dead. Outside the voice of a
Mexican was heard to say: "Line up
on each side of the door. They
must come out
Smith told his men that. the time
had come to make a dash.
The heat had burned the tops of
their heads. Private Stephen J. Co
lock dashed out. His body was found
next morning not far away riddled
with bullets. j
Smith, leading the other cavalry?
men, turned to the left and made for
the corral, the Mexicans firing at
them. The body of Private Lawrence
K. Rogers was found not far from
the burned house, but Tyrce could
apt be accounted for when Smith
and his men, who reached the hills
In safety Investigated next morning.
Tyrce may have been made prisoner,
but if so the Holdlcrs here think he
has probably been killed by now.
After the attack on the American
troops the bandits rushed to tho wax
factory of W. K. Ellis and destroyed
It, besides seettlng fire to the factory
store. Ellis' home was ransacked. A
cross that hung hero Is believed to
have saved the house from being
burned.
When morning came the American

GERMAN DEFENDS WILSON.
MAXIMILIAN HARDEN PRAISES
THE PRESIDENT OF UNITED
STATES FOR MORAL .
COURAGE.
He Contends That Germany Should be
Ashamed of Those Who Slander
America's Chief Executive.
Berlin, Friday, May 5?(Via Lon-]
don, May 6.)?After figuratively tak?
ing the public's breath away two
weeks ago by a daring article cap
tioned, "If I Were Wilson," Maximil
lian Harden today returns to an ex?
haustive defence of President Wilson,
his policy and the entire American
standpoint.
In a leader in the Zukunft entitled
"The Heal Wilson,4' Herr Harden
praises President Wilson as a "man
of high moral and high spiritual char?
acter of whom we might be proud if
he were ours." What the writer
characterizes as "lazy ignorance" is
represented as "shattering from the
mantle of would-be patriotism, which
in reality has nothing In common
with genuine patriotism when Presi?
dent Wilson is assailed as he fre?
quently has been.
"Ninety-nine one-hundredths of all
the so-called war literature," Herr
Harden continues, "should be sent to
where it belongs?to the paper mills?
and the public should return to hooks
from which a wide-awake spirit
speaks. Including President Wilson's
The New Freedom.' Then perhaps
pure common sense will return to you
and awaken you to the duty of re
fspecting the dignity of foreign peo?
ples." , .
I Herr Harden follows with a brief
character sketch of President-Wilson,
in which he calls the president a
brave "opponent of evil and abases"
and alludes to him as "actuated by a
devp for - his people and possessed of
the will tojead them to'the heights-or
" fo??J?v*ft** th*y nad gotten into
f because they have* read calumny In
newspapers."
In all his controversies with Ger?
many, says Herr Harden, President
Wilson has acted from absolute con?
viction. "Dare we measure by the
standard of a student's squabble the
complaints of a great free nation led
by a man of the weight and, impor?
tance of President Wilson?" asks the
writer,
"If President Wilson, after a thor?
ough investigation, is convinced that
warlike activities of Germany have
broken the laws of humanity it was
f not only his right but it was his duty
to talk with clearness. He owes this
not only as a duty to himself but to
us."
Turning to the position of Chancel?
lor Von Bcthmann-Hollweg in the
present controversy Herr Harden
said: "The chancellor must not ap?
proximate that his authority is equal
to that of the entire Reichstag." In
alluding to Herr Von Heybraud's as?
sertion that America stood In close
connection with England before the
war, Herr Harden points out that Ger?
many also did so with Italy, Russia,
lpan, Portugal and England.
Herr Von Hey brand's statement
that America was first secretly and
then openly on the side of Germany's
enemies, Herr Harden claims not to
have been proved, and he declared
that America has never violated neu?
trality.

WILLING TO ADOPT IDEAS FOR?
MULATED BY SCOTT AND
OBREGON.
Decision Clears Way for Full Co-oper?
ation of Americans and Mexicans in
Campaign Against Bandits?Final
Conference Today to Determine Fu?
ture Use of Railroads by American
Troops.
Washington, May 6.?Gen. Car
ranza's approval of the Scott-Obregon
agreement, announced in news dis?
patches tonight, is said to clear the
way for more thorough cooperation
j between the American and Mexican
i troops in the campaign against Villa.
I It already has been approved by Pres?
ident Wilson.
Details of the agreement never
have been made public, hut it is uit
derstood to provide for more exte
slve use of the railroads by the
American forces and to establish a
definite understanding on many ques?
tions which officials here and in Mex?
ico City have feared might lead to
clashes between the Americans and
the Carranza soldiers. Reports that a
j definite date had been set for with?
drawal of Gen. Pershlng's expedition
have been officially denied.
No official notification of Gen. Car
ranza's decision had reached Wash?
ington late tonight and officials were
in ingorance as to the minor points
of the plan on which the first chief
was reported as reserving decision. No
real obstacles to an agreement Is be?
lieved to have been interposed.
Negotiations, for a formal protocbl
covering the subject of the expedition
.are expected to be resumed here af
jter the Scott-Obregon agreement has
ben ratified. While the latter deals
with the military features, It is
thought necessary to work out diplo?
matic features through regular diplo?
matic channels. Gen. Carranza*s note
of April 12, suggesting that discus?
sion of the withdrawal of the Ameri
rUau forees be taken up, suspended ne
tocol.
Administration officials were elated
at the success of Major Howse and his
men In surprising a Villa band, pun?
ishing it severely and coming off
without any casualties. It is expected
to lend to the prestige of the Ameri?
can troops among the Mexicans.
Gen. Pershing's report, forwarded
by Gen. Funston to the war depart?
ment today, says the latest attack on
tl. > Villa bandits was made by his
small force after a night march of
thirty-six miles. Tho text of Gen.
j Pershing's report, dated at San An?
tonio, in Mexico, was as follows:
"A band of 140 Villia bandits,
which attacked our garrison yesterday
at Ojo-Azules, remained there in camp
last night. Leaders of the band, Cruz
Dominguez, Guilio Acosta and Anton?
io Angeles, were captured, the latter
being severly wounded. Numbers of
wounded unknown but must be many.
"Several prisoners taken, also sev?
enty-five ponies and mules. Our cav?
alry rode them down and killed many,
using pistols/'
Minor Objections.
El Paso, May 6.?First Chief Car?
ranza sent a message to Gen. Alvaro
Obregon tonight Informing the Mex?
ican minister of war that he had
found the agreement with the United
States satisfactory with the exception
of a few minor points. It is believed
that the final conference will be '.eld
tomorrow, when the protocol will be
signed. Gen. Jacinto Trevino, com
mander of the department of the
northeast of Mexico, departed for his
home in Torreon tonight.
The Alvarado Mining and Milling
Company and the La Boquilla Com?
pany, which operate in the neighbor?
hood of Parral, have arranged to start
men and supplies south next Tues?
day to resume working their proper?
ties, a move, it was suid, they hardly
would make if they were not assured
of the tranquil conditions.
Notwithstanding Gen. Obregon's
declaration that there has been no
split between himself and Gen. Car?
ranza, persons here in close touch
with the Mexican situation pointed
out that there is hardly likely to be
an increase in the cordiality of the
two men's relations after Gen. Car
ranza's failure to immediately endorse
Gen. Obregon's action in the confer?
ence with Gen. Scott. Tho border is
beginning to take as much interest in
the future relations of the two lead?
ers as in the relations between the
United States and Mexico and the
present negotiations between Scott and
