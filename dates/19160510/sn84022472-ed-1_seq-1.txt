Cora P. . Dayton, better known as

a chauffeur living at 154 Gregory St
Mrs.; Dayton, whose maiden name was
Cora Stultts, has -had a sensational
history during the last few years. In
November, J.910, whenshe was scarce
ly - out of her teens, she . eloped one
night with, Sherman Hill, clerk at the
Atlantic hotel who robbed 7the safe
of the hostelry of several hundreds of
dollars before leaving the town.' Be
cause of his unusual height of 6 feet
and 7 inches and his slenderness, Hill
was easily traced and was arrested in
Washington, D. C, a few weeks later,
in the company of " his attractive
brunnette . companion.- -,'(''.
He was sentenced to a year in. the
county jail and while there, because
of his ability as a bookkeper was put
to work as a clerk in the office.
Here he had access to the telephone.
Mrs. Dayton's persistency in calling
him up, proving" that her', love for
him did not wane while he was in
carcerated, caused him . to be remov
ed from the", place in the office.
Several week sago, the woman's
husband. Arthur W. Dayton, Jr., a
store clerk in this city, obtained a di
vorce upon the grounds of deser
tion. . In obtaining the license to wed
again, Mrs. Dayton gave her age as
24 and her residence at 1647 Barnum
avenue. Mr. McHugh is not listed
in, the directory, but he. also is re

Mrs. Dayton's career here has been
