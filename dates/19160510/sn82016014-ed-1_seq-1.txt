BY E. T. CONKLE.
El Paso, May 10. General
Scott held the whip hand today
in his negotiations with War
Minister Obregon. For the first
time the American forces avail
able for duty along the border
and in Mexico were numerically
superior to the Mexican forces,
and military officials believed
Obregon's bluff has been called.
Another conference between the
war heads is expected today and
authorities confidently expected
full agreement on the details of
the original plan.
While Scot refused to listen to any
plan involving a time limit on the ex
pedition. Amfriaa- military prepara
tions were progressing rapidly to
hrow 7,1)00 more men within striking
distance of Mexico. Neither Scott nor
Funston underestimates the danger of
an explosion which no diplomatic ac
tion could repair.
l'unstoii Still at El Paso.
General Funston still is here and
said he had no idea when he would be
back to his headquarters at San An
tonio. This was taken to indicate
that today's conference may not be
the last.
From Juarez came reports that
General Obregon and his advisers
were optimistic regarding the outcome
of the conference. It is not expected
that A. .1. McQuatters, the mining man
who withdrew from last night's meet
ing, will take further part in the dis
cussions. General Scott explained to
day that in view of the attitude of
General Obregon, he had not thought
It proper to insist on Mr. icQuattors
attendance, especially as mf-tauer uau
no official standing.
No answer had been received early
todav from Washington to General
.-Vott's message reporting General
Obregon's proposal for a joint patrol
of the international boundary. Gen
eral Scott said the conference sched
uled for today was to be held regard
less of whether a reply was received te
the plan of the Mexican minister of
war.
Pershing Pmws Lines Closer.
General Pershing has been ordered
to begin a greater concentration of
his troops. Those detachments still
operating as far south as San Antonio,
it was reported, will be withdrawn to
Colonia lJublan.
Keott Is Hopeful.
Washington, May 10. Secretary
Baker informed President Wilson to
day that the conference between Gen
eral Scott and General Obregon last
night was not conclusive and it would
be continued today. He indicated that
the outlook was more favorable for an
agreement being reached. The exact
points of difference were not revealed.
Confide In Conferees.
El Paso, May 10. Increasing con
fidence in the ability of Generals Scott
and Obregon to effect an agreement,
was evident on both sides of the I'io
Grande today. The situation, how
ever was not materially altered by the
conferees in their thre hours talk last
night. The optimism appeared based
largely upon admission that another
conference would be held perhaps to
fi day, and that General Obregon and his
associates maintain attitudes of hope-
associates maintain attitudes of hope
fulness.
The Mexican representatives yester
day insisted upon placing the question
of withdrawal of General Pershing's
forces ahead of the question of co
operation. Wants Co-operative Border Patrol.
General Scott was expected to re

Cymric were given today by members
of the crew, who were landed here.
They say that the torpedo which de
stroyed the ship struck the engine
room. The explosion blew all the sky
lights off and extinguished the lights
throughout the vessel. Foui- men
were killed by the explosion and the
chief steward was drowned.
One hundred and seven members
of the crew took to the boats shortly
after the liner was torpedoed but re
turned when it was seen that the
steamer was not in immediate danger
of sinking. They remained on board
for two hours, when a sloop which had
heard the Cymric's wireless calls for
help one hundred miles away, arrived
and took them off. The sloop stood
by the stricken liner until she sank at
3:30 in the morning.
All of the crew were British sub
jects except one Russian and two Bel

on board, members of British consular
service, all of whom were saved.

Montgomery, .Ala., May 10. Ala
bama's representation in congress
probably will not be .changed as a re
sult of today's ' Democratic primaries,
although with less . than one-third of
the vote counted eartly today it was
impossible to give anything approach
ing a definite result. A long ballot and
second choice voting employed for the
first time caused the delay.
Former Representative Hobson was
running slightly behind Wm. B. Bank
hoad for representative from the new
Tenth district in the face of scatter
ing returns.
President Wilson, unopposed on the
presidential preference ballot, received
all but one of the votes counted in
Montgomery. Henry Ford's name was

BERLIN TO ACCEPT
Wilson's Answer Is O. K.
Lokal Anzeiger.

American Jfote Is Same as Was
Expected There.
CONTAIIiED NO CONDITIONS
Germany Has No Strings Tied
to Concessions Made.
Too Much Stress on Condi-
Honed Sub War Change,
BY CARL W. ACKERMAN.
Berlin. May 10. President Wilson's
brief reply, accepting Germany's sub
marine concessions, bnt rejecting the
conditions with reference to England,
will prove acceptable to Germany, the
Lokal Anzeiger stated today.
The Lokal Anzeiger did not have
the exact text of the latest communi
cation from Washington before today's
editorial comment was written but
was guided by apparently reliable re
ports of its contents. The Berlin
newspapersi took the view that Presi
dent Wilson laid too much stress on
the alleged conditions , attached to
Germany's concessions and declared
that in reality there was no condition
at all. Germany merely. reserving the
right to change her mind if the United
States did not succeed in its negotia
tions with England-. -
"li advance reports .we have re
ceived are true," said the Lokal An
zeiger, "President Wilson's answer is
what was expected. If he emphati
cally declares that he will not ac
knowledge any conditions attached to
the the change in. submarine. warfare,
then he is knowingly opening a door
aireaay open, because the German
note contains no such condition."
BANKERS SCARED
Fear Bankruptcy Unless Peace
Is Made Soon.
Verdun Deadlock Suggests Pos
sibility of Settlement.
London, May 10. London's busi
ness leaders are turning to the prob
lem whether the war can be ended
by diplomacy before insolvency on the
continent becomes unavoidable. Such
insolvency would fall heavily a Lon
don as tne center or credit. The nrm
tary deadlock in the west after the
Verdun failure and the stiff attitude
of President Wilson toward German
submarine atrocities suggest the pos
sibility or a settlement favorable to
the allies in the west and south and
favorable to the central powers In the
near east and in Russia in the Black
sea region.
But a statement by Lord Curzon
that he has never heard the cabinet
discuss peace has caused some sur
prise. The Westminster Gazette to
day is politely skeptical concerning
the real, as distinct from the face
value of the German submarine note.
The Dublin executions are .arousing
criticism and the policy of Irish ad
ministration will be arraigned to
morrow in the house of lords. The
Northcliffe press has now switched off
its army agitation to . another panic
about food and ships its two last
policies being characteristically con
tradictory. Even the coalition govern
ment cannot concentrate all its en
ergy into the army, navy, merchant
marine, munitions and finance at one
and the same time.
The stock market was mildly unde
cided. Very little business was trans
acted in any class of securities. The
Morning Post, a sound banking au
thority, considers the recent small
break in our New York exchange
could be corrected, considering the re
sources on hand.
BLAMES GIRLS' DRESS
W. C. T. U. Says New Clothes Respon
sible for Trouble.
Modern dress received a knockout at
a meeting of the Oakland chapter W.
C. T. II. at the home of Mrs. George
Hutson. 4S4 Sumner street, Tuesday
afternoon.
It was decided by the- club tnat tne
modern insufficient styles are respon
sible for girls being approached and
accosted on the streets.
One of the members remarked:
"Why I heard a young man say, "Gee,
Sixth street is sure a good place to get
your eyes full.' " The remark failed
to score as several women immediately
said. "Yes, the wind sure blows the
dust in vour eyes there."
The club decided that the present
styles are an injury to society. Oak
land girls will not be allowed to romp
on Oakland playgrounds in bloomers
next vesr. if the W. C. T. U.has any
influence. They can participate in
their athletics just as well in skirts,
according to the members.
The next meeting of the society will
be held at the home of Mrs. C. H.
Buck 428 Sumner street. May 23.
DIES IN CALIFORNIA
Body of Geo. A. Hancock Will Pass
Through Topeka Thursday.
The body of George A. Hancock, a
railroad official who died recently in
Los Angeles, Cal., will pass through
Topeka on Atchison, Topeka & Santa
Fe train No. 4, Thursday, enroute to
Port Huron, Mich., where funeral ser
vice will be held Saturday afternoon.
The body will be accompanied by Mrs.
Hancock and her daughter.
George Hancock was well known in
Topeka and over the Atchison, Topeka

number of years superintendent of
motive power for the road. At the
time of his death, he was superinten
dent of the same department of the

Bull Moose Leaders Unite for
. Roosevelt at X. Y. Session.
New York, May 10. ;"I haven't any
interest in ultimatums that fail to ul
timate," remarked Colonel Roosevelt
today, commenting on the Wilson re
Joinder to the German submarine con
cessions. jl -
"The latest Wilson note is up to its
usual standard," he continued.
"Whether they apply to Villa, Obre
gon, Carranza or the German empire,
I don't care for ultimatums that don't
ultimate. It Is peculiar that we
adopt one stand toward Haiti, be
cause it is small, and another toward
Mexico, because it is bigger."
The colo lei spent the dav at "lit
erary labors" which means he saw a
score or more visiters at the Metro
politan magazine offices. Late this
afternoon he was to join with the
executive committee of the national
progressive party which met to select
a temporary chairman for the Chicago
convention June 7 and to make other

Among the progressive national
committeemen in attendance were:
Icks of Illinois, Brown of Ohio, Gardi
ner of Maine, Hale of Massachusetts,
cnairman Perkins, E. R. Hooker of
Connecticut and Chllds of New York.
The progressive leaders are a unit
for Roosevelt as the nominee. None
would discuss the Roosevelt nomina
tion for publication but privately the
belief was expressed that, if Hughes
were nominated by the Republicans
and the G. O. P. convention conceded
certain reforms along the lines of
Americanism" in its platform, Roose
velt and the third party probably
would amalgamate. To this belief was
added the opinion that Hughes now
was at a disadvantage, having re.

Col. Natividad Alvarez, outwitted and
captured by his seven American pris
oners, has confessed that the main
forces of Mexicans who raided Glenn
Springs were Carranzistas from San
Pedro, 20 miles north of Torreon.
They are led by Gen. Pablo Uroas, a
Carranza commander.
Capt. O. C. Dow. of the customs
service, and Capt. Monroe Fox. noted
throughout the Big Bend country as
the hardiest and squarest of the
frontiersmen, came up to Marathon

days for the express purpose of cross
ing the river and robbing and killing
"gringoes."

Colonel Alvarez and two other bandit
guards at daybreak Monday and made
them prisoners.
The Mexicans are prisoners of Sher
iff Walton at Boquillas. Tuesday night
some of the border men wanted to
give them "Villa Justice," but the In
fluence and authority of the sheriff
saved them. They are being held for
the twofold purpose of getting further
information from them or making
nosiages or tnem to compel the safe
return of Deemer and Payne.
