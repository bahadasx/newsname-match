TOMATO CLUBS
READY FOR 11
CANNING CLUB WORK GROWING
GIRLS DOING WELL WITH
THEIR GARDENS.
During the last two weeks the
County Agent for the Girls' Canning
dabs has visited each one of her
clubs and we are interested to learn
that the girls are at work and are
doing even better work than last year
The girls who were in the work last
year are adding beans, cucumbers,
peppers, and many other vegetables
to their gardens. Two are trying to
grow celery. Most of the girls had
a oart of their tomatoes in the field
and all have an abundance of nice
plants and a nicely prepared garden
to plant them in.
The following clubs are now at
work:
1. Abbeville Canning Club. 21
members, President, Mary Graydon;
Vice-President, Gladys Wham; Sect'y
Maude Hawthorne.
2. Antreville Canning Club. 6
members; Pres. Eunice Ferguson;
Secretary, Elizabeth Mc Carter.
3. Cold Spring Canning Club, 8
members. Pres. Rubv Uldrick: Vice
Pres. Bertha Stone; Sect'y, Ola
Winn.
4. Bethia Canning Club, 5 members.
Pres. Julia Link.
5. Due West Canning Club. Six
members. Pres. Belle Nance; VicePresident,
Edith Todd; Secretary,
Willie Caldwell.
6. Monterey Canning Club?Five
members.
7. Lebanon Canning Club?Four
members.
8. Donalds Canning Club?Two
members.
9. Warrenton Canning Club?Two
members.
10. McCormick Canning Club?
Seven members. Pres., Willie Mae
Furqueron; Vice-President, Martha
BelL _
Of this number, 45 are trying the
whole 1-10 acre, while the others are
taking 25 plants along with other
vegetables intending to specialize on
pickles and fancy canning. In some
cases the girls are not able to secure
the 1-10 acre, and sometimes the
agent advises smaller gardens where
the girls are too small to attempt
more.

niflhed some of the most, brilliant'' %
ministers in the A. R. P. church. The V 5 -M
Sloans furnished some of the most
distinguished ministers and theological
instructors in the A. R. P. church.
One Sloan was a speaker on the anti-slavery
platform with Wendell
Phillins and Garrison. Dr. Sloan's
one great regret was that Phillips 5
and Garrison neither of whom were
orthodox believers could hold the
church up as the bulwark of hdman
slavery. The Reids whose names are
found in local graveyards furnished
a descendant, Whitelaw Reid to be
the distinguished editor of the New
York Tribune and be an ambassador
to England. The Renwicks came of
a family that furnished the last Covenanters
martyr for the scaffold in
Scotland. His successor had to be
ordained by the Calvinistic church in
Holland. 7;;%

Such is the history of a people, a
faith, a church represented in the

church should erect monuments in

are buried a people who always stood

feared not the wrath of earthly kings
but feared him who is Immanuel. In
short the Covenanters dissented frqm
voting, holding office, etc., because
they held the United States constitution
in its failure to recognize, Christ
as king of kings to be immortal and
of an atheistic-infidel order, also because
it says government is ordained
of we the people when the Bibls
says all government is ordained of
God. They hold that the Bible should
be the supreme guide in governmental
affairs; they will not tolerate
members of secret orders in their
communion and they hold to the
Psalmody of Uncle David as the only
manual of praise.
Mr. White has been a newspaper
reporter for twenty-seven years on
the Republican and Democratic papers
in his city. From here he goes
to Xenia and Cedarville, Ohio, where
later generations of the Boyd-Chalmers
and Reid families are buried
Mr. White is not a member of the
Covenanter church though both his
parents were once in the church and
lis father was a minister of the denomination,
but is now in the Presbyterian
church, North.
