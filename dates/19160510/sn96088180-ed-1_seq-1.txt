strong Indication here that the United
States will take no action 'in the case
of the British liner Cymric, destroy

where Americans were not Jeopard
ised has been not to protest.

In, the situation yet. On the other
hand, it was explained that the ad
ministration would, as in the past,
continue to consider unwarned sub
marine attacks illegal, according to
this government's interpretation of
International law. Such attacks will
be considered cumulative evidence of
the German attitude toward submar

German Government Makes
Good on First Part of tbe
Agreement in Controversy
and Disavows Attack
Washington, May 10. Germany's
admission that a Teuton submarine
attacked the British steamer Sussex
was received at the state department
today. The note said that the sub
marine cqrotnaoder had already been
punished, hut did not state what pen
alty had been Inflicted.
In part the note said:
"The further investigation mado
by German naval authorities on the
basis of American material baa been
concluded. The assumption express
ed in the note of tbe tenth ultimo
that damage to the Sussex was trace
able to causes other than attack by
a German submarine ran not be main
tained." "On the basis of this material,
Germany ran not withhold its con
viction that the ship torpedoed by a
German submarine is In fact iden
tical with the Sussex," the communi
cation said. "There can no longer
be any question of the possibility of
two Independent similar occurrences.
Additional reason for this belief Is
constituted by the fact that officers of
the American navy found fragments
of an explosive in the Sussex hold de
scribed by them on firm grounds as
parts of a German torpedo."

DEFEND VERDUN
Berlin, via Wireless to Sayvllle,
May 10. "While It Is generally con
sidered that, attacks on fortified posi
tions must be made with forces four
times superior to those of the de
fenders, the Germans assaulting' Ver
dun are really less than half as num
erous as the French army, which has
at that point not less than 800,000
men," said a Beml-officlal war office
statement today. "This is half of
the entire force which France still
has at its disposal for active fighting.
The second German attack on Ver
dun Is based on the crushing effect
of heavy German artillery. The
French are unable to compete with
Germany In artillery and ammuni
tion. The enormous French losses
are due partly to the effect of the
artillery and partly to the tenacity of
the French, who refuse to abandon
their trenches." . '
Major Moraht, in reviewing the
situation, pointed out that Teuton
successes had been against armies
numerically superior. The Austrlans,
he said, held an Italian force of twice
their strength helpless in the
trenches.

STATE HllfE
DELEGATES TO SEE
EM
The sessions of the state grange
today have .been given largely to
routine business, reports, resolu
tions, etc., bat this afternoon the
election of officers will occur before
the closing hour. There has not
been a great deal of political maneu
vering for the offices noticeable to the
layman, but the naming of the place
for the next convention is expected
to produce something of a contest.
Astoria is making a lively bid for the
honor of entertaining the grange in
1917, and its supporters seem to
think they have more than an even
break to. bring their entry in a win
ner. The Thursday program will be
broken at 11 o'clock In the morning,
at which time United States 8enator
Albert C. Cummins will speak in this
city, his initial speech upon his cam
paign in the west In the afternoon
at four o'clock the visiting grangers
will be the guests of the city upon
an auto ride around the valley, tak
ing in the sugar factory, the city, the
orchard districts, the fields of beets,
hop yards, etc. The start will be
made from the Kerley block, where
the grange sessions are being held.
PLAV SAFE III DEAL
WITH CARRAII2A
Washington, May 10. The ad
ministration will take no chances on
Carranca, This is the inner signi
ficance of the move in rushing mili
tia and additional infantry to the
border. Supplementary orders last
night dispatched eleven coast artil
lery companies and five field artillery
batteries to San Antonio, Texas.
While officials .assume that Car
ranza Is acting In good faith, they
admit that his attitude is surprising,
in view of his making a demand for
a time limit on the presence of
American soldiers in Mexico after
President Wilson had informally ap
proved the agreement which Generals
; Scott and Obregon reached several
days ago. Officials say that the situ
ation has been made more grave by
Carranza'8 tactics. The administra
tion supposed the agreement to be
practically in effect, but Carranza has
not yet approved It, so far as has
been officially reported.
Reinforcing of the border troops Is

'persuade General Obregon to aban
.don his time limit demands, and put
a stop to plotting on the American
side of the line. Officials discounted
the possibility of this move inflaming
the Mexicans. The administration
believes that this reinforcement will
tend to prevent intervention. It is
evident also that the administration
has reached a point where it is not
inclined to temporize much further,
but It is still optimistic regarding the
future. It does not regard the Scott
Obregon conference situation as hope
less. ,

troops, said this afternoon that he
had received all the men he asked
for. He expects to concentrate upon
the militia, starting . today. Most

points where there are no regular
army border patrols.
There have been numerous requests
