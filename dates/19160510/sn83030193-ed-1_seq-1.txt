BKrtLI.V (via wireless to Sayvllle,
V. I.), May 10. More, than a million
men are now engaged on both aides
in the renewal of heavy ttRlitlnt;
around the fortress of Verdun, it was
aeml-offlclally stated here to-day.
"While It Is generally considered
that the attacking forces must he
four times superior to the dcfond,lng,
the German troops really number less
than one-hnlf the French forces en
gaged, which ore not lens than 800,
0'0," said the statement. "These
figures represent half of the entire
force which Trance still has at hsr
disposal for active lighting.
"The second German attack agatint
Verdun Is based on the crushing ef
fect of heuvv German artiller). The
taking of small Western fortresses at
tho beginning of the war by heavy
artillery was onlv a prelude to the
artillery results being attained to-day.
At inv rate, the I'ronch have bem
unable to compete with German artil
lery and ammunition. The enormous
French losses are due paillv to the
effect of German artillery and partly
1 the tenacity of the French, who
will not abandon their trenches."
German troops, continuing their
successes northwest of Verdun, have
driven the French further bock south
west of Hill 301, aid to-day's official
statement, which says:
"In tho Atgonne, the enemy, after
a mining operation, attempted to en

".Southwest of Hill Oul advanced de
tachments of tho enemy wero driven
further back. Ono detachment was

"German airmen dropped numerous

AS WOMAN IS HELD
Hartford Officials to Exhume
Bodies I'ell of Evidence
Against Mrs. Gilligan.
SHE BOUGHT ARSENIC.
Relatives Take Inmates From
Archer Home Sue to
Get Money Back.
(Special from a Staff Correspondent
of The Evening World.)
HAItTFOIU), May 10. WUU Mrs.
Amy Archcr-Galllgan of Windsor safe
In tho Hartford County Jail here,
State's Attorney Hugh M. Alcorn and
Capt. Robert T. Hurley of the Con-
signed by Dr. H. F. King, Medical
! Rxa,1,lnt'r Windsor, stated that
Andiews died of gastilc ulcers, but a
secret autopsy conducted by lantern
light In a tool house In tho Cheshire
cemetery, where tho body was ex
humed a week ago last night, revealed
a deadly quantity of arsenic In tho
stomach, according to tho report of
Dr. Arthur J. Wolff of Hartford, who
analyzed Its contents. When Capt.
Hurley, Dr. Wolff and two usslstants
opened the casket they wcio amazed
to find the body of Andrews In an al
most perfect slate of preservation.
They believe this was accounted for
In large measure by tho amount of
arsenic found when the vital organs
were examined.
Willi this discovery, confirming sus
picions aroused by more than a year's
qulot Investigation, tho State's Attor
ney caused Mrs. Gilllgan's at rest and
arraignment beforn Justice of the
Peace Ralph M. Grant In Windsor.
She waived examination and was held
for the ,Iuuo Grand Jury In tho Su
perior Court, it Is understood, how
ever, sho will not go to trial then, as
State's Attorney Alcorn desires to
gather other cvldenco to form tho
basis for a superseding Indictment
which he hopes to procuro from tho
September Grand Jury,
"OTHER POISON THAN ARSENIC"
IN SECOND BODY.
This evidence, In all probability,
will ciimu from other bodies of per
sons who died in tho Archer Home,
Ono such body has been exhumed al
ready and .according to State's At
torney Alcorn, It contained "a poison
other than arsenic." He declines to
reveal the Identity of tho iecond body
which was examined.
It la expected Mrs. Gilligan may
claim that Andrews was a suicide,
and tho Stuto desires to head off such
a defctLso by piling up, If possible,
a damning array of autopsies to show
that Inmates of tho A ichor Homo died
of poison too frequently to make the
theory of sulcldo tenable. When the
news of Mr.. Gllllgan'a attest was
madii public, Thomas I.ec, Miss Mary
C. Wagner, George Foster and n .Mrs.
I'arnsleud, Inmates of thu Archer
Home, were hastily temoved by iola-
lives. Othuis of thu sixteen remaining
