Lecture by Blind Chaplain.
Rev. M. W. Farman of Westfield,
chaplain of the Vermont senate, gave
a lecture before an open session of
Crystal Lake grange on Friday evening,
May 5. The subject of the lecture was
"Light in Darkness." Mr. Farman is
a veteran speaker, having been on the
public platform for more than a quar
ter of a century. He portrayed the
darkness which envelopes the blind and
also the light which illumines their
lives. As he is totally blind, he spoke
from personal experience. This was
the first time that he ever spoke in
public on this subject. He showed that
blindness is a condition of comparative
ly minor consequence, which does not
really reach down to the fundamentals
of life. He told not only the depriva
tions of the blind but also of the pleas-
REV. M. W. FARMAN
ures that they enjoy. He showed
that they are not a helpless class of
people but are able to engage in trades,
professions and business successfully.
He showed tnat success or taiiure is
not determined by sight or by the lack
of it where the individual possesses
a sufficient amount of grit and good
sense. He gave an exhibition of touch
reading and told of many wonderfu
things that the blind are able to do,
He held the close attention of an ap
preciative audience for more than an
hour. No one having an opportunity
should fail to hear Mr. Farman deliver
this intensely interesting lecture. He
was master both of himself and his au
dience.

An unsightly rubbish dump has been
started a short distance outside the
village on the South Barton road which
has been commented upon very unfavo
rably by townspeople as well as stran
gers. It is a fact that a suitable
dumping-ground is a difficult thing to
find but the public does not seem to ap
prove of this spot.

ally approved by our citizens and the
quicker it is applied this year the bet
ter it will please the public
The Woman's Literary club met with
Mrs. Erwin Wednesday evening, May

The Boy Scouts are just starting out

of wood, aside from fruit trees. Al
bert Wakeman has secured thirty-two
kinds with Roland Tripp as a close
second with twenty-seven. Several of
the boys have seventeen. They have
formed a baseball team with Henry
Cutler 's s captain and George Carter as

A few years ago St2te Fish and Game
Commissioner Titccmb had placed in
Crystal lake a consignment of Chinook
salmon fry. Last fall a fish weighing
several pounds was found at the outlet
of the lake and was discovered to be
one of this species of salmon. This
encouragement has led Mr. Titcomb to
take considerable interest in Crystal
lake as a ground for this particular
salmon. Few bodies of water in this
state have been stocked with this fish
and the fact that a consignment of
nearly 20 cans of fingerlings were sent
here last week by Mr. Titcomb and
placed in the lake is particularly pleas
ing to local fishermen. This is a Pa
cific salmon and a very gamey fish
which presages some of the best of
fishing here in the near future.
Mrs. W. E. Hanson entertained the
Afternoon Study club at her home
Thursday. Seventeen ladies were

Room in Heaven," and "Elder Lamb's
Donation." The next meeting of the
club is the annual business meeting.
The W. C. T. U. met with Mrs. E.

time tonight. This fair which prom
ises to be one of the most unique and
novel entertainments ever held in Bar

"Ten cents to get in but a dollar to
get out."
BARTON ACADEMY 22, CRAFTS
BURY 2.
With a changed line-up, Barton acad
emy played the best ball they have
shown this season, decisively defeating
Craftsbury 22 to 2 in Saturday's game
at Roaring Brook Park. Emerson,
pitching his first game for the home
team, struck out 14, walked six and al
lowed only four hits. Wallace Abbott
caught a strong game and Parker was
back on first base after having been
out of the game because of sickness.
At no time was the outcome of the
game in doubt and the game was more
interesting to watch than the one-sided
score would indicate. The all-around
work of the Barton boys and the play
ing of Emerson, W. Abbott and Cutler
were features of the game. In the
fourth inning Craftsbury had three
men on bases with none out and
seemed likely to score but a fast double
play took away all chances. There
was a good attendance at the game.

Isn't it a nobby one,
Just the proper style."

tified byFrark W. Nicholson, secretary
of the New England College En
trance certificate board that Barton
academy has been approved by the
board for a period of three years, until
Dec. 31, 1919. This approval speaks
well of the academy and attests to the
high standing of our school.
The boys of the baseball team were
made happy last week by the arrival
from the firm of William Read & Sons,
Boston, of new baseball supplies such
as catcher's mitt, catcher's mask, first
baseman's mitt, baseballs, set of
bases, etc. These goods are the best
that can be bought and the boys are
pleased to have such good material.
The game between Barton and Or

Saturday had to be postponed on ac
count of rain, until Thursday afternoon
when the Barton boys, accompanied by
a large crowd or high-school pupils.
journeyed to Orleans, where they met
their Waterloo, being defeated by the
score of 27-3. As a matter of fact.
Orleans made so many runs tbat we
lost count of them. In the first inning
Barton made one run and Orleans in
the same inning piled nine runs across
the plate, said runs being due to
errors, hits and four passes by Abbott.
The game was loosely played on both
sides because of the poor condition of
the field, which was simply a field of
mud and puddles. For Orleans, Mann
and LaCourse, the battery, excelled
while Cutler at second base, played a
good game for Barton. The battery
for Barton was W. Abbott, Comstock
and Emerson.
