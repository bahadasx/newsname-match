London, Eng., May 9.—Tlie French
and German forces fighting to- the
northwest of Verdun apparently are
deadlocked, the Germans being un­
able to advance farther and French
attempts to expel the invaders from
captured positions being unavailable.
The only infantry engagement re­
ported anywhene along the French
fronts was launched by the Germans
against a French trench to the west
of Hill No. 304, northwest of Verdun.
The French, however, brought into
play their curtain of fire, and the
Germans were unable to debouch.
The shelling by the Germans' of the
Russians at the Jkskul bridgehead on
tlie eastern battle line continues.
The Russians, in Armenia, however,
have put down with heavy casualties
a stubborn Turkish attack and south­
east ward in the region of Mush, driv­
ing the Ottoman forces from their
defenses in a mountain chase. In
addition, the Russians, operating
westward from the Persian frontier
toward Bagdad have dislodged the
Turks from fortified positions, and
driven them farther westward.
The Goiizia bridgehead and the
regjon around San Martino in the

SIMMS IEET
Minneapolis. Minn., 'May 9.—
Churches which fail to extend to
women members the right to vote in
their affairs were criticized by dele­
gates to the Mississippi Valley Suf­
frage conference today, during an ad­
dress on church co-operation, by Kate
Schritsmier of Wisconsin. The speak­
er was saying that many of the
churches offer women first lessons in
government by giving them voice and
vote? in church affairs. The dele­
gates from all sides of the hall in­
terrupted and demanded to know why
this had .been the case. A delegate
from Missouri said "his preacher had
gone so far as to preach every Sun­
day night against suffrage."
"What did you do aibout it?" in­
quired the delegates.
VQuit the church," was the reply,
and the hall rang with clapping of
hands.

O. J. Sorlie Will Run for
Lieutenant Governor, Making
N, P. League the Chief Issue
O. J. Sorlie, Buxton, one of the: first
farmers to break with the Non-Part­
isan League has sent out his peti­
tions for lieutenant governor.
He will make the issue the Non­
partisan Leasue and will fight
Kraabel on that issue. Mr. Kraabel
has received the endorsement of the
'Non-Partisan League.
Mr. Sorlie Is one of the original
insurgents of the state. He served
tferee terms as a member of the state
legislature and was chairman of the
railroad ^committee when the anil
pass hill was passed.
Telegrams ha-- been dispatched to
Kraabel to ascertain whether he has
adopted the entire program of the
Nonpartisan League. It is believed
that he will make a statement soon
as to the meaning of the Non-Part­
isan League endorsement.

buildings of the Atlas Powder com­
pany plant at Landing were ilernpl
ished by dynamite explosion's. An­
other mixing house was destroyed by
fire resulting from the explosion.
Many persons here, at banding,
Dover and other points miles distant,
were cut by flying glass from broken
windows as the result of the explo­
sion. lie roar of the explosion was
heard for a distance df ten mllcB in
every direction. Buildings a ldJtg dis­
tance away were shaken, windows
were shattered and dishes were
thrown from shelves.
The explosion was attributed by
Superintendent. R. I. Rierer to one of
Lhe "unexplainable accidents" which
sometimes occur in the manufacture
of explosives. The only explanation
he could offer as to the cause was
that some one of the men killed made
a mistake in the "mixing."

DECIDE FtllHG SUE
St. Paul, Minn., May 9.—The con­
ference of railroad managers and
trainmen brotherhood leaders in New
York June 1 will have an important
bearing on the outcome of the wage
dispute that ma- develop into a coun­
try-wide strike. There will be no
backing down on the part of the rail­
way managers and it remains to be
seen whether the trainmen leaders
will finally be induced
(to
see that
arbitration is the better way out of
tie difficulty.
Pressure is now being brought to
bear upon these brotherhood leaders
to accept arbitration rather than to
call a strike. Trainmen themselves,
it1 is declared, are growing weary of
the struggle. Many of them feel sat­
isfied with present wages and are
urging their representatives not to
hazard present schedules should a
deadlock follow.
That the temper of the public has
had a great deal to do in bringing
tibnut this feeling on the part of the
trainmen is acknowledged in many
quarters. A spirit of fairness among
the older employes is also asserting
itself. The men. them,selves are be­
ginning to see that a strike would
not meet uith public approval and
tbey are, therefore, casting about for
a »ietter way out cf the difficulty.

Going to Hjort.
It is said that Thomas Hall's en­
dorsement by the Non-Partisan Lea­
gue had swung the support of the
Republican organization over to Mr.
Hjort. The report also is that there
will be a working agreement among
11 Republican candidates to assist in
defeating any Republican who has ac­
cepted the Non-Partisan League en­
dorsement and has swallowed the so­
cialistic platform. This applies with
equal force to William Langer who
together with Mr Hall is hand and
glove with the I. W. W. and Socialist
agitators behind the .Non-Partisan
League.
In a recent number of the Non-Part­
isan Leader, there was a statement
from Mr. Hall in which he said that
one of the p.ondesf. moments of his
life was when he received the en­
dorsement of thh socialistic league.

best available figures here.

lElisio Arredondo Mexican anabas-'
sador designate, took to the state. de-v
partment today a wrlten Statement pt.
the information upon which hie badps
charges that the Glenn- Springs raid
was planned and probably carried out
from the American side of the line.
Because of this, he presented a re­
quest that, the United States take ad­
ditional precautions on its own side
of the boundary.
This added to the confusion of offi­
cials here as to General Obregon's
object in delaying proceedings at iEl
Paso.
Mr. Arredondo's statement was tel­
egraphed to General Funston for hts
information in meeting the situation'
on tlie border. It asserted that An-'
tonio Villareal, a presept exile from
Mexico, was responsible for the Glenn
Springs tragedy, and bad sought to
incite Mexicans on both sides of the
line to engage in other raids. The
statement told of two dynamite plots
said to be forming no*. General
Funston will direct the niustering in1
of the National Guardsmen and also
assign them to such posts as he de­
sires.
Ten companies of coast artillery
stationed at Gulf and Atlantic coast
points were ordered to Sali Antonio,
Texas, tonight, to serve as infantry
with the border patrol.
Mobilization Pointy
It was announced at headquarters
this afternoon that General Funston
had designated Ft. Sam Houston as
the mobilization point for the organ­
ized militia of Texas. He has named
Douglas, as the mobiliiation point
for the Arizona National Guard, and
the New Mexico militia will be mobi-.
lized at Columbus, New Mexico.
Officers at headquarters estimated
that the mobilization at all three
point's should be completed within a
week.
It is the duty of the governors of
the states affected to order the militia
of their respective states to the desig­
nated points at once, subject to the
orders of General Funston.
The movement should fce well under
way, it was said, within the next day

NATIONAL GUARD CALLED .BY WILSON
Washington, May 9.—Administration officials interpret the military
law, by virtue of which guardsmen of three states were ordered into tedr:
eral service today, to mean that the president has full authority to pireia'
the militia into service, and each state so affected is required to recruit.•
its militia to full war strength immediately and to follow recruits to the
base of operations as fast as they are sworn in.
•Army officers believe that there will be no difficulty In fettioc out
the full strength. They anticipate instead a great Bptirt of enlistment in
the :National Guard of the three states, because of the chance for active
service.
'President Wilson specified no time of service in his call. The law
