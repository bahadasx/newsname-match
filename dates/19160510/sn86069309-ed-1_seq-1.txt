The selection of Senator Beckham ns
a member of the Conference Committee
on the part uf the Senate of the military
bill is a distinct tribute to his ability
and services in Congress The bill is
the most important measure before

Since he became a member of the

Practical Economy
Baking powders made from alum or
phosphate may be bought for a trifle less
than Royal Baking Powder, which is made
from cream of tartar, derived from grapes.
Alum powders are not only cheap, but
they differ greatly in leavening power.
If a cheap baking powder is used for a
fine cake and the cake turns out a failure
there is a waste of costly materials worth
more than a whole can of the cheap bak
ing powder.
Royal Baking Powdor produces the
finest food, and its use therefore, results in
an actual saving.
