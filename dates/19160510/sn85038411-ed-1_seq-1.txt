Field Artillery Getting Ready For Service; National

PROPOSED MILITARY AGREEMENT BETWEEN
CARRANZA AND U. S. IS STILL UNSIGNED
Three Hours' Conference Last Night Ends Without Definite
Decision; Continuing Today; Pennsylvania Troops
Will Probably Be Among Next Detachment to Be
Called Out; Men Are Splendidly Drilled and Fully
Equipped
Washington. May 10.—Virtually the
last American troops In the United
States were being mohilized to-day
for Mexican border service. With the
National Guard of three states, they
were under orders 10 hasten to rein
force General Funston's army. The
total of between nine thousand and
ten thousand Included eleven com
panies of coast artillery ordered out
last night by Secretary Baker.
The proposed military agreement
between the C'arranza and American
governments remained unsigned and
General Obregon, Mexican war minis
ter, after a three-hours discussion with
General Scott last night, arranged for
still another conference to-day.
If the situation warrants. National
Guards of other States will lie called
out for border patrol duty, officials de
clared. Secretary Baker stated, how
ever, that no further mobilization or
ders are contemplated immediately.
In addition to the 4,000 United
States soldiers and an equal number
of militiamen from Texas, New Mex
ico and Arizona ordered to the border
yesterday. Secretary Baker announced
that 1,000 soldiers, comprising eleven
companies of coast artillery stationed
at Gulf and Atlantic seaboard po3ts.
had been ordered to San Antonio to
serve as infantry with the border pa
trol.
The secretary also said five bat
teries of the Fifth Field Artillery had
been ordered from -Fort Sill. Okla
homa. Three additional batteries of
the third tield artillery were held in
readiness at Tobyhanna, Pa., under
orders to-day.
'15,000 Troops Ready
Unofficial estimates placed the num
ber of troops now on Mexican duty or
under mobilization at about 45,000.
Admiral Winslow, commanding on
the West Mexican coast, reported to
the Navy Department to-day that the
steamer Sajt Juan had taken <lB Amer
ican refugees front Manzanillo and 23
from Mazatlan. and was proceeding
with Ihent to San Diego. Cal. The
admiral made no reference in his dis
patch to new disturbances on the
coast but said there was a general
feeling among Americans to leave
Mexico.
■May Delay on Pennsylvania
It is believed that troops called yes
terday were selected because they can
be more easily acclimated to the hot
climate of northern Mexico than the
troops of the States further removed
from the border. In all likelihood
the next step of the War Department
w'M i:>e to complete the Fifteenth divi
sion, and it may be that the National
Guard of Pennsylvania. Ohio and New
York, the best trained troops of the
National Guard, will not be called for
several weeks, even if intervention is
decided upon.
In Splendid Condition
Colonel Mctver. Chief of the Divi
sion of Militia Affairs, said:
"The Pennsylvania National Guard
comprises a.n efficient and well-drilled
division of the organized militia. As
to equipment and property, the Penn
sylvania Guard is in splendid condi
tion. The same applies to the Na
tional Guard of Ohio, where the mili
tia is well equipped for service.
"According to the report made on
December 31, 1915, by Governor
Brumbaugh and corrected to May 23,
the militia of Pennsylvania consists
of "46 officers and 10,164 enlisted
men. Governor Willis' report for
Ohio shows 543 officers and 6.9.53 en
listed men. West Virginia has 113
officers and 1.643 enlisted men.
"As to whether the militia of these
States will be called into service along
the border or in Mexico, we cannot
say at this time. So far as I know,
no orders have been s*nt to them to
get in readiness for active duty. De
velopments will determine this, no
doubt. But we all know that with
large detachments of the reßtilar army

in the Philippines, in the Canal Zone

For Militia and Regulars
Called For Border Duty
Snn Antonio, May 10. A board of
army officers to-day began laying out

In addition General Kunston has
ordered the five batteries of the Fifth
field artillery at Fort Sill to move to

quarters that the batteries probably
would be sent direct to El Paso front
Fort Sill to join the one battery of
the same regiment now on duty there.
The coast artillery companies will
be held at Kort Sam Huston tor dis
tribution along the border as the

Believe Early Agreement
on Army Reorganization
Bill Will Be Reached
By Associated Press
Washington. D. C.. May 10. —Work
on the army reorganization bill was
resumed to-day by the conference
committee of the House and Senate
with indications of un agreement be
ing near at hand. It was expected that
virtually a new bill, the result ot a
compromise, would be readv to be laid
before President Wilson next week.
Prospects are that the Senate con
ferees will have to irive up the volun
teer army provision for a reserve of
261,000 men in view of its repudiation
by the House. Senate conferees hope,
however, to strengthen the-House pro
vision authorizing citizen instruction
camps which would afford tile nucleus
of a volunteer army.
It was expected that a regular army
with a peace footing of approximately
3 75,000 men with the Senate expansive
organization system for 220,000 men
in time of need would be agreed to.
The House provision for reorganization
and federalization of tho national
guard, which would provide for a de
fense reserve of about 400,000 men,
also probably will be approved. It
was regarded as likely that the House
amendment for a nitrate plant to -ost
$20,000,000 would be accepted.

The school board this afternoon took

tee, adopted yesterday afternoon, In

President. Stain m, when asked by a

it he reason for the increase, .said that
it is absolutely necessary. "What else
is there to do," said he. "The board
finds itself with deficit of between
$95,000 and SIOO,OOO, and with an in
jcome of $25,000 or $30,000 too little
at the old rate to meet current ex
penses. This deficit has been accumu

with the arbitrary and unlooked for
addition by the School Code of one

rate for that year had been fixed long

along from year to year without in

less, that either the assessments would
increase or the expenses would de
crease and enable it to get through
without increasing the taxes, but
