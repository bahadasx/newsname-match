ANOTHER FURIOUS
RAID BY BANDITS
Of Villa's Force This
Time Into Texas.
AMERICAN SOLDIERS BATTLED
Bravely For Hours Against Great
Odds Three Soldiers and
Boy Killed.
.AMERICAN CITIZENS KIDNAPED
Alpine, Tex., May 7. Villa ban--dlts,
some seventy In number, forded
tthe Rio Orande Friday night and,
.sweeping ..fifteen miles Inland on
American soil, raided the little set
tlement of Glenn Springs and at
tacked a detachment of American
cavalry, consisting of nine men of
Troop A, the Fourteenth Cavalry.
. Three troopers and a ten-year-old
boy were killed, two cavalrymen
"Were wounded and another is miss
ing. ' He Is believed to be a prisoner
of the bandits, who are now fleeing
southward into Coahulla, Hex.
Two American citizens, J. Dee
mer, and a man named Compton,
according to reports received here,
were carried across the Rio Grande
and reports have it that their
throats were cut. A po3se of fifty
citizens of Marathon to-night are in
pursuit of the Vllllstas.
The missing trooper Is Private
iRoscoe Tyree. The little boy Is the
son of Compton. He was deaf and
dumb, and bandits are thought to
liave killed him because he could
not answer their questions.
The two wounded troopers, Pri
vates J. Blrck and Frsik. Defree,
"were brought here this afternoon,
"badly. youndqdv Blrck's body was j
' mieu wun smaii Drass pieces or
'tacks tired from a shotgun. Defree
was burned about the head and
shoulders.
In a little adobe house, nine cav
alrymen made their fight for life
against the seventy or more Villlsta
bandits at Glenn Springs. A hall
of shot poured for more than two
hours "into the single window of the
aUobo house, but the cavalrymen
licpt up a steady rifle fire in defiant
answer. Then the Mexican leader
ordered fire balls to be thrown on
the roof, thickly thatched with can
d.Jarla. The blazing roof tortured the
soldiers below and burnt their heads
and bodies. Smashing the door, the
troopers broke for the open, firing
as they ran. Two were shot and
Irfllari na tliav flari Hna la mtaolnv
"killed as they fled. One is missing
and It is believed he Is dead. An
other wa3 kUled as he tried to climb
through a window
According to tho story brought
liere the Mexican bandits first at
tacked a store, and one or two
houses In Roqutllas, where they
made Deomer and Compton prison
ers and then sped fifteen miles
northward to make their attack oa
Glenn Springs which Is fringed by
russed hills. At Glenn Springs they
wrecked a wax factory belonging to
"William Ellis, his store and rest
dence, besides one or two other
small buildings.
At 5:30 Thursday evening the
main body of fifty to seventy mount
ed Mexican bandits forded the Rio
Grande at Boqulllas and swept Into
the little settlement, shouting
"death to tho Grlngoes." The ban
dits looted the store of J. Deomer
and set 'it on fire. Deemer and a
clerk named Compton were seized
and bound. The bandits packed
.their loot on their horses and after
setting one or two small frame
houses ablaze, galloped away north
ward. Heading toward Marathon, Tex.,
the bandits in their night ride camo
upon Glenn Springs, whero a small
detachment of nine cavalrymen un
der command of Sergt. Bmyth, of
Troop A, Fourteenth Cavalry, was
Rfifloned.
The Mexicans- appeared suddenly
on the tpp of a li tit beneath which
Glenn gprings nestle. Noting their
numbers, Private Dlrck, on outpost
duty, emptied his revolver tp rouse
the camp and then dashed back to
the tent, Sergt. Smyth and Prlvato
Croskeniyjumpod to the fly of tho
tent. Observing numbers of Mexi-(
cans at hand, they ran to an adoba,
iut, wnero tne six other cavalrymen
wero Preparing to make their de
fense. The door of the house, which had
only one window, was barred, and
Sergt. Smyth, seeing that his men
were outnumbered by ten to one,
gave orders to shoot carefully and
not waste the ammunition.
The bandits poured a constant fu
slllade of shots at the window and
door of the adobe house. Not an
American cavalryman fell In the exchange.
The little band took turns shoot
ing from the window. Dlood stains
In the dry ground around the house
was the only evidence that the ban
dits suffered In the attack, but
Sergt. Smyth believes that seven or
eight bandits were killed and, some
were wounded.'
For threo long hours the fight
wention.
"Just a little while more, boys,
and daylight will be with us,'" urged
Smyth, who knew the bandits would
retreat once they became good tar
gets In the light of dawn.
The Mexicans fought In skirmish
formation. That was proof to
Smyth's eyes that he was dealing
with a military body. The attack
ers' horses were tethered some dis
tance to the rear and the brigands
maintained their attack on threo
sides of the house from which there
was no escape except the door and
the single window.
Unable to route the Americans
from their mud-walled fort, the
leader of the Mexican band gave or
ders to throw fire balls on the roof
which was thatched partly with tin
and partly with candalaria weed.
Flaring torches made of torn cloth
and weeds were dropped upon the
roof, which started to burn. There
was no water In the house to check
the flames. The heat In the house
became Intense and the faces and
backs of the soldiers still firing spir
itedly through the window, became
blistered and burnt.
"I can't stand It any longer,"
cried Private William Cohen. "I'll
take another shot and then try and
make It through the window," Co
hen leaped into the window frame to
make his dash for the open. A bul
let split his skull and he fell back
dead into the house. Outside the
voice of a Mexican was beard to
say: "Line up on each side of the
door. They must come out."
' Smyth told his men that the time
had come to make a dash.
The heat had burned the tops of
their heads. Private Stephen J. Co
lock stepped forward to the door
and smashed the boards with his
gunstock. The gun broke, but the
door gave way and Colock dashed
out. His body was found next
morning not far away, riddled with
many bullets. Ho probably ran into
the main band of Mexicans.
Smyth, leading the other cavalry
men, turned to the left and made
for the corral, the Mexicans firing at
ih 11 n m. . . .- .
them ns they fled. The body of PrI
vate Hudson Rogers was found not
far from the burned house, but Ty
ree could not be accounted for when
Smyth and his men, who reached tho
hills In safety, Investigated next
morning. Tyree may have been
made prisoner, but if so tho soldiers
hero think he has probably been
killed by now.
After the attack on the American
troops the bandits rushed to the wax
factory of W. K. Ellis and destroyed
It, besides setting Are to the factory
store. Ellis' home was ransacked.
A cross that hung In one room Is
believed to have saved the house
from being burned.
When morning camo the Ameri
can troopers crept back to tho set
tlement and saw tho main body of
some fifty Mexicans packing their
loot upon their horses and on the
nine American mounts which thoy
had captured. Then the bandits
turned towards tho Rio Grande and
started for Boqulllas. Here, tho
brlkands carried Deemor and Comp
ton across the river and It Is report
ed here to-night that their throats
had been cut. Tho Mexicans carried
their dead and wounded., away,

MINE OPERATORS
WILL NOT INSIST
On
a Cut In Wages In
Agreement.
A PROPOSITION IS SUBMITTED
Will Be Laid Before Convention
In Central City On
May II.
MODIFIED CONDITIONS NAMED
Negotiations between the commit
tees representing the miners and op
erators of the Western Kentucky
field were broken off Friday when
the operators submitted a final Prop
osition agreeing to last year's wnge
scale under certain changed work
ing conditions favorable to the op
erators and not unfavorable, accord
ing to the latter, to the miners.
The sub-committee representing
the miners, composed of Richard
Baker, W. O. Smith and J. T. Main,
stating that the committee was un
able to accept the terms under Us
present authority, received Mie prop
osition and agreed to lay It before a
convention of District No. 23, Unit
ed Mine Workers of America, to be
called In Central City. Both sides

it for tho filing of a reply.
F. P. Wright, chairman of the
Joint Scale Committee which lui
been striving to agree on the 1916
scale since March, In announcing
the terms of the proposition, stnted
that the miners practically were
willing to accept last year's scale,
but were holding back on proposed
changes In the rules governing
working conditions. One of these
changes Is the limitation of the
nilno "rooms" to bo operated by'fwo"
miners, from four to three. Accord
ing to Mr. Wright a saving of 23 per
cent, in the amount of material nec
essary to operate such "rooms" will
result to the operators, while the
earning power of the miners .will
not be decreased. The other changes
proposed are declared not to be ns
Important, although the miners' or
ganization will have to act upon
them.

operators follows:

HORRIBLE DEATH OF A
IiAD AT CENTRAL CITY
Central City, May C Basil Dy
ers, the lS-year-old son of Ranee
Byers, was Instantly killed In the
yards of the L. and N. railroad In
this city. Accompanied by his broth
er Bryant Byers, he was walking
through the yards when It is sup
posed that he decided to make a
short cut to his home which was
Just across the track and distant
southerly about 100 yards. Edging
sideways between the cars, as the
distance between them was too
small to permit of his walking di
rectly through the opening between
the cars, he had gotten exactly be
tween the bumpers on the cars when
a car that rolled down by gravity
struck tho car directly north of him
and he was pinned between the two.
his life being crushed out at once.
His brother Bryant, who. It Is
said, was afraid to pass between tho
cars, walked around jand did not
know of liis brother's death until ho
came to the place where the body
was suspended between the cirs.
Running to his home he called to
his mother to come at once, as Basil
was dead. The mother, who had
been with Basil all the morning in
town, thought Bryunt wip mista
ken, that Basil could not be dead.
Bryant, however, clung to her dress
and hurried her to the place where
Ills brother wns suspended with his
hands pushing agaiust the car in an
effort to save himself. The screams
of the mother aroused the town and
quickly willing hands pushed the
cars apart and carried the boy to his
home. Undoubtedly the child never
knew what happened to him, for he
never made the sliglie3t sound and
the brother was close enough to him
to havo heard the faintest outcry.
Tlio death os greatly regretted, as
tlie child was a good, hardworking
Jipywjvojielpe'd his mother to sup-
ponnne lamny.

With England.
OCR FINAL WORD IN PREMISES
Washington, May S. A note to
Germany has been practically com
pleted nnd probably will go forward
to Berlin to-day. It will be made
public soon afterward. It is under
stood it will be brief, informing Ger
many that .73 long as tlie new iiv
stritctions to submarine commanders
nre observed diplomatic relations
will be continued, but that the Unit
ed States cannot allow Germany to
dictate Its negotiations vlth Great

Tlie President worked on the pro
posed coinmunlca'tion early to-day,

will not be necessary to wait for the
Cabinet meeting to-morrow.
"While the German note has avert
ed, for the present at least, a break
In diplomatic relations, It was said
to-day that tho President was not
satisfied with ,he apparent condi
tions attached by Germany. Tlie
United States stands by Us demands
that Germany cease her attacks on
vessels In violation of international
law, regardless of negotiations which
may be carried on with Gieat Brit
ain over the food blockade.
Some of liis advisers wanted him
to make no reply to tlie German note
and only wait developments, but lie
Is understood to have decided to
send the new communication.
It was authoritatively stated that
should another ship carrying Amer
ican citizens be sunk by a German
submarine in violation of tho prin
ciples of International law diplomat
ic relations would be severed Just as
soon as the facts were established
and without any further exchange
of communications.

exact meaning of tlie words employ
ed. Secretary Lansing also had ex
amined tho note In detail at Annap
olis, where he went to spend the

moned to tlie White House.
In connection with the peace sug

tention of officials has been attract
ed here by a passage In a statement
given out In London Saturday by
Lord Robert Cecil. Minister of War
Trade, In which lie mentioned tlie
discussion of peace by Germany, and
added that "our attitude, at any
rate, is unchanged." This statement
was regarded as meaning that the
Allies were not ready to discuss
peace on Germany's terms.

RURAL CARRIER'S WORK
SAMPLE OF IMS DUTIES

start out f i om Hartford every morn
ing excopt Sunday and there arc
two loop routes a few miles out. The
following report of Mr. A. M. Pal
