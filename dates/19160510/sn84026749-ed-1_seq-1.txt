East of the Meuae, and In the
Woevre region there Was only Inter

Halted In repeated assaults against
the Hill 304 positions the Germans did
not return to the attack on the north
western front of Verdun last night.
The only Infantry fighting on tho
Verdun front' occurred In Avocourt
wood, where there were unimportant
grenade struggles.
In upper Alsace, a German recon
naissance, attempting to capture a
French post at Hlnbech. was repulsed.
French Are Driven Back
Northwest of Verdun
BHRI.IN fvla wlrelcns to Sayvllle),
May 10 German troops, continuing
their successes northwest or Verdun,
have driven the French further back
southwest of Hill 304. It Is officially
announced.
The Germans hava oxlendod their
positions on the hill itself,
"In the Argonue, the enemy after
blasting, attempted to enter our lines
but wa icpulseri." suld the official
statement, "rfouthwett of Hill 3IH,

"On the east front a Russian attack

Berlin Says 1,000,000
Men Are in Battle
BERLIN (via wireless to Sayvllle),
May 10. More than a million men are
now engaged on both siflqea in the re
newal of heavy lighting around the
fortress of Verdun, it Is seml-offlclally
siaioa nere toaay.
"While It Is generally considered that
the attacking forces must be four times
superior to the defending, the German
troop really number less than one-half
the French forces engaged, which are
not less than 800,000: said the statement.
"These figures reoresent half the en
tire force which France still has at her
disposal for active nghtln
i ne second German attack against
Verdun 1 based on tho crushing effect
of heavy German artillery. The taking
of small western fortresses at the be
ginning of the war by heavy artillery
was only a prelude to the artillery re
sults being attained today. At any rate
the French have been unable to com
pete with German artillery and am
munition. The enormous French losses
are due partly to the effect of (German
artillery and partly to the tenacity of
the French, who will not abandon their
trenches." '
Major Moraht, German military critic,
pointed out today that all the German
successes on the east and west front
were gained against enemy forces
numerically superior, and that the Aus
trlaris. for a ear, have held back an
Italian force twice as strong numeric
ally. Large German Squadron

Germany, the Lokal Anzelger stated
today.
The Lokal Anzelger did not have, the
exact text o fthe latest communica

Berlin newspaper took the. view that
President Wilson laid too much stress
on the alleged condition attached to
the German concessions and declared
that In reality there was no condi
tion at all, Germany merely reserving
the right to change her mind If the
United States did not succeed In Its
negotiations with England.
"If advance reports wo have received

Consul Frost Confirms
Torpedoing of Cymric
LONDON, May 10. American Consul
Frost at Queenstown today wired con
flrmatlon of preos reports that the
White Star liner Cymric, torpedoed on
Monday afternoon with the loss of
five lives, was attacked without
warning.
Frost also confirmed the statement
that there were no Americans aboard
the Cymric and that she was not
armed.
It was authoritatively stated today
that the Cymric was not In the ad
miralty service,
As an ordinary merchantman, It Is
contended, she was entitled to all the
Immunities granted by Germany In
her pledges to the United States In
the reply to the. American note.
Captain Beadnell was Quoted as ay
Inc that the Cymric was torpedoed
without warning and that no subma
rine was seen, though several of the
crew saw the wake of the torpeds.
One or two officers, however, declared
they saw a submarine, which sub
merged Just before a torpedo crashed
through the englno room, killing four
men outright. A fifth wa drowned In
attempting to enter a boat.
War munitions valued at more than
$1,000,000 went down with the ship.
Special dispatches all agree that the
Cymric did, not attempt to oncapc.

MEN ARE EAGER TO GO SOUTH
Organization Here Is. Only One
Under Direct Control of the
President.
"The national guard of the District
Is ready.
"We hope tho President will call on
us."
This is the statement of Brig. Gen.
William H. Harvey In reply to an in
quiry as to whether or not the District
of Columbia National Guard had any
Instructions regarding the probability of
border duty.
"I have heard nothing from the War
Department or from any other official
regarding the probability of the District
mllltla being called Into service," said
General Harvey: "We hope It Is true
that we are to be called out. We are
all ready to go."
The District of Columbia national

gsnixed mllltla whlcn tbe President
could order directly to the border or
Into Mexico as a part of Oencral Kuns
rbn's force without going through the
formalltlesvthat would be required in
other' lections" of the country , ..
. Tho national auard of th District Is
the only organisation directly under the
orders of the President, .to do as ha
wills, except the regular iirmy? These,
jscui wrre mans piain oy ucnerai nar-
vey. Mllltla organizations trt the SUtes
are under the direct control or the gov
ernors or tnose states, and under
nres
em conditions canopiy oe used in
those
aiaica.
Mllltla experts at the War Depart
ment do not believe other national
guard organizations will bo needed Im
mediately on the border. The natlonat
guard of California will probably bo
the next organization ordered Into the
field. But, as Is the case of the mllltla
organisations of Texas, Arizona, and
Mew Mexico, it will be used within the
confines of the State to which it be
longs. The oranlzatlons of the three
States brought' Into the service by Pres
idential order yesterday are to be used
In those three States.
This leaves the Natlonat Guard of the
District to be reckoned with as a possi
ble factor In backing up the border
patrol if there Is need for more troops,
because the President can send It where
he needs It most. The organization that
could be put Into the field on short no
tice from the District Includes:
One regiment or Infantry, with ma
chine gun company.
Two batteries ot field artillery.
One signal company.
One field hospital company.

i
COLUMBUS. N. M May lO.-The
American expeditionary forces were
hastily redistributed and points along
the lines of communication strengthened
today, following receipt ot Inljortant
communications by General Ijfirshlng
from General Funston last nlghj
Troops were moving all along the line,
carrying out new plans, and the base
camp became unusually alert to guard
against unforeseen Incidents.
Throughout the night 'casuals" sol
diers detached from their regiments tor
various reasons-were being Issued guns
and equipment under orders to go Into
Mexico early today, and one company
of the Sixth Cavalry win ordered across
the border without horses or motor
trucks. These troops had returned for
remounts, but authorities here decided
not to give them new horses for tho.
time being'. '
A heavy guard was thrown about the
camo last night, while the wireless
crackled with a constant flow of com
munications between Funston and
Pershing, Outposts were moyed far
ther from town and every passerby was
halted. A triple guard was thrown
about the big gasolene t.inka containing
thousands of gallons ot tho explosive
fluid.
Arrangement were made today for
mobilization here of the New Mexico
mllltla. It was not known definitely
when tho first troops will arrive, but
part At least, were expected today.
Columbus spent a sleepless night due
to rumors that at large body of Mexi
cans were approaching. Daybreak
found the town'a guard trebled In aomo
places and outposts stationed far be
yond customary limits.
Apprehension continued thin morning
until Capt. F, F, Dodd, in a new aero
plane, hastily assembled, scoured the
country for seventy-five miles and re-
riorted there wero no Mexicans moving

ALL DEPENDS
CONFERENCE
Concessions Must Come From
. Mexican GovernmentNo
Time Limit to Be Considered
OUTLOOK IS NOT PROMISING
Administration Officials Hope,
However, That War Chiefs
May Get Together Today.
Upon Alvaro Obregon, Mexican
minister of war, depends the char
acter of the military operations
which the United States army will
undertake for the better protection
of the American border. Keenest
interest centers here in his final
attitude.
The outlook is not over-promising.
The War Department this,
morningo-received from General
Scott an overnight report that the
conference which the latter had
last night with Obregon had ac
complished nothing in the way of
an agreement.
General Scott added, however,
that there would be another con
ference today, and Administration'
officials here still are hopeful that
the two military men will get to
gether ;on a settlement.
OBREGON MUST YIELD.
The concessions must come from Obre
gon. The United States will not agree
to a time limit.
The seriousness with which the Ad
ministration has taken into considera
tion the possibility of trouble with
Carranra la emphasised by the liberality
with which Bceretary Baker has re
sponded to Funston's request for more
troops.
Not only has the rest of the United
Btatcs been stripped of mobile army
orces to meet the border situation, but
the War Department has done the two
things which the general staff has been
extremely anxious to avoid.
it has drawn heavllv on the coast
artillery corps, and to that ctftcnt weak
'JlT.?..,ne coa,t defenses against the po
Ability of an attack from across the
Atlantic: and It has taken almost the
last soldier from the patrol that hah
been posted along tho Canadian border
ever since the war In Europe began.
All That Is Left.
. The Second Cavalry, part of it at
Fort Ethan Allen, Vt.. the only Can
adian border post now with a garri
sonand a part at Fort Myer, Va.;
and a battalion of the Third Field
Artillery, now at Tobyhanna, Pa., art
practically the only mobile forces left
north of the border, and the Third
Field Artillery battalion Is under or
ders to hold Itself In readiness to pro
ceed to the border.
With these stens taken armv nfrtrr
declare that If more troops are need
ed by Funston the President will,
have to call out more mllltla. The
division of mllltla affairs Is preparM
for such a contingency.
That the action of the President hag
struck a responsive chord was strikingly
Illustrated this morning when Secretary
Baker received from Gov. Lucius E.
Plnkham of Hawaii a-cablegram advis
ing him that tho national guard of
Hawaii offers Its services "for such as
signment an the War Department be
lieves the present exigencies may re
quire." Ready To Back Wilson.
Congress, according to the sentiment
exprfssod by Its members. Is ready to
back up the President aa far as he goes,
The prospect Is that their aid will .be
called for In tho near ruture.
..TJl?Aenl0IB'!Pc.y appropriation of
f 8,000,000 allotted last March for the ex
penses of thn pursuit of Villa, Is nearly
exhausted. Mora money will bo needed
In the near future, nnd. In view of the
participation of the national guard in
tho border operations, will probably bo
required In larger amount.
"I am confident," said Secretary
Baker, "that Congress will give us the
money needed, though I cannot at this
time estimate tho amount which will bo
required."
Itcss dlsnatches from Mexico r.llv
state the feeling there la optimistic, but
Intimate this Is due to the fact thai the
general Impression prevails that the
Foaeo pact provides for the withdrawal
of United States troops.
General Scott s renort is understand In
have disclosed a condition more serious ,
than a mere deadlock with Obregon.
He told the Secretary of War that
