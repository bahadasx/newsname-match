WASHINGTON. May 8. Thedc
facto government's new mining de
cree contains only slight modifica
tions from the original draft although
representations were made by the
State department to have it altered in
various ways before it became ef
fective. The department gave out a state
ment today, saying:
"The department is in receipt of
advices from Mexico City stating that
the mining law effective May 1, is
practically the same as that recently
referred to in reports sent to the de
partment of State. The law, as pass
ed, in effect, contains minor modifica
tions only."
The new law was devised with the
object of forcing the development of
idle properties and to make holders
of large numbers of claims pay heav
ier taxes than small operators.
American interests operating in
Mexico objected and through Special
Agent Rogers at Mexico City the
State department urged modification.

Party Recognizes
Rendered It By
The honor accorded LcRoy Ander
son at the Republican State convctv
tion at Tucson last Saturday by his
selection as a delegate to the Republi
can national convention, was a richly
deserved one and meets with the ap
probation of the Republicans not only
of Yavapai county, but of the State as
well. There was not a dissenting vote
in the district caucus wnich nominat
ed the Prescott attorney for the posi
tion and the action thus taken was un
animously approved by the conven
tion. Mr. Anderson1 has been an ardent
and loyal worker in Republican ranks
for many years. He has given freeh
and cheerfully of Ms time, service
and money and has asked nothing in
return. It was therefore but fitting
and proper that the party should rec
ognize his efforts.
"I have never before sought or re-
rpivoil ant' rernfrnitinn frnm tht R-
publican party." said Mr. Anderson
yesterday. "My work in its bcnalf
was not actuated by a hope of favors
of any kind or character. Whatever
small part I have played has never
been with any idea in mind but Re
publican success, which means pros
perity for the American people. It
was therefore gratifying to mc when
my friends urged that I should be a
candidate for this honor and the fact
that I was unanimously elected. I
consider a compliment than which no
mgher could have been paid mc. I
leave Wednesday for my old home in
Kentucky and will end by vacation
by participating in the nomination ot
the next president and vice-president
of the United States."

ARIZONAN'S ATTEMPT TO
HANDLE LAW SINGLE
HANDED FURNISHES
FOOD FOR CHUCKLES.
The following Washington dispatch,
regarding the amusing activities of
Senator Henry F. Ashurst, of Ari
zona, was carried in the last Satur
day edition of the Los Angeles Times:
"Henry Ashurst. the cowboy orator
from Arizona, was sat upon with
force and violence in the senate to
day. Senator Ashurst is of the smart
Aleck type and is forever announcing
with a movie actor gesture, ot deh
ance that no senator shall censor his
remarks.
"But on this occasion the illustrious
Henry was scored until at the close
of the incident lie was .sitting down
behind his desk pale and confused.
He looked like a bad little. bpy who
had been spanked.
"The fuss came up over the Indian
committee renort. Tuie senator is
chairman of the senate committee on
Indian affairs. When the Indian bill
came before the senate there was add
ed on motion of Senator Jones of
Washington an amendment to have
the books of the Indian bureau gone
over bv a board of government effici
ency experts. The house having also
passed a bill, each legislative body
sopointed conferees. Ashurst was
one of the conferees of the senate, his
iob. of course, being to insist that all
the senate provisions be made into
law.
"When the bill -was brought back to
the senate this morning it was dis
covered that the efficiency experts ha!
been eliminated. Chagrined at the
elimination of this important amend-"
nicnt. one of the senators asked if the
house conferees had refused to con
sent to the senate amendment.
Nerve of Ashurst.
"'Oh. no.' said Senator Ashurst in
a top loftv manner. 'Those conferees
were eager to have the amendment
retained.' Hcnrv covly confessed that
lie had reversed the action of the
senate and cut the amendment out
himself. He had vetoed the senate.

SENATE
BERLIN IS NOTIFIED NO
OTHERS ARE INVOLVED
American Acceptance of Answer Made
In Firm Manner, With No Oppor
tunity For Any Misunderstanding,
WASHINGTON, May 8. A note was cabled Berlin today in
forming Germany that the United States accepts the "declaration of
abandonment" of the former German submarine policy but gives
formal notice that the United States cannot entertain, much less
discuss, the suggestion that the conduct of German naval command
ers be contingent with the conduct of any other government. Secre
tary Lansing issued a statement tonight saying there was no rea
son for a quarrel with Germany as long as the altered policy is
lived up to.
Following is a text of the United States' acceptance of Ger
many's reply:
"The note of the imperial German government has re
ceived careful consideration by the government of the United
States. It is especially noted as indicating the purpose of
the imperial government in the future, that it is 'prepared to
do the utmost to confine the operation of war for the rest of
its duration to fighting the forces of belligerents' and that
it is determined to impose upon all commanders at sea the
limitations recognized by the rules of international law, up
on which the government of the United States has insisted.
"Throughout the months which have elapsed .since the
imperial government announced February 4, 1915, its sub
marine policy, now happily abandoned, the government of
the- United States has been constantly guided and restrained
by motives of friendship in its patient efforts to bring to an
amicable settlement the critical questions arising from that
policy. In accepting the imperial government's declarations
to abandon the policy which has so seriously menaced the
good relations of the two countries, the government of the
United States will rely upon the scrupulous execution hence
forth of the now altered policy of the imperial government,
such as will remove the principal danger of an interruption
of the good relations between the United States and
Germany.
"The government of the United States feels it neces
sary to state that it takes it for granted that the imperial
German government does not intend to imply that the main
tenance of its newly announced policy is in any way contin
gent upon the course or result of diplomatic negotiations of
the United States and any other diplomatic government, not
withstanding the fact that certain passages of the imperial
government's note might appear susceptible to that con
struction. "In order, however, to avoid a possible misunderstand
ing, the government of the United States has notified the
imperial German government that it cannot for a moment
entertain, much less discuss the suggestion that respect by
German naval authorities for the rights of the United States
upon the high seas should in any way, or in the slightest
edgree, be made contingent upon the conduct of any other
gvernment affecting the rights of neutrals and non-com-tatants.
The responsibility in such matters is single, not
joint and absolute but not relative."
