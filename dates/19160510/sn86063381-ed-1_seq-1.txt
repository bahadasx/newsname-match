VOLUME XIV, NO. 115:
KOOCHICHINGCOUNTY
INFINANCIALTANGLE
EXAMINERTORESCUE
Expectation of State Aid in Meeting
Bond Issues is Given as
Cause.
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND
PUBLIC EXAMINER INVESTIGATE
Reported That the Debt of the County
is More Than $2,000,000
Bonded to Individuals.
Koochiching county is practically
bankrupt.
So serious are the financial affairs
of the county that Attorney General
Smith and Public Examiner Fritz
will go to International Falls tonight
to investigate and if possible straight
en out the tangle.
This condition is said to have been
brought about by excessive expendi
tures through bond issues for good
roads and other internal improve
ments.
Bonds to Individuals.
It is reported that the debt of the
county is more than $2,000,000, for
which bonds have been sold to pri
vate purchasers.
As one of the new counties of the
state, Koochiching county has been
constructing numerous ditches and
roads, and in doing so has bonded it
self to the limit. While exact figures
are not available, the belief is that
the bonding limit has even been ex
ceeded.
Much of the money obtained has
been at a high rate of interest and
in disposing of bonds excessive agent
commissions have been paid. Under
the law county bonds cannot be sold
below par, but agents may be em
ployed in selling and in doing so the
law has practically been violated.
Case of Misjudgement.
"We have been asked to inquire
into the financial affairs of Koochi
ching county," said Attorney General
Smith at St. Paul today, "and from
all accounts the conditions there are
most distressing. Of course, the first
thing in mind would be some crim
inal act on the part of those in
charge, but I believe the whole thing
is more a case of misjudgment than
anything else. Expected state aid,
I think, is at the bottom of the trou
ble. Another things is, the county
is new, and in all such cases there
is generally more or less laxity on
the part of those who have charge of
its affairs. I am going up there in
an effort to straighten out the tangle
and I hope to be successful."
Misunderstanding Cause.
From what Attorney General
Smith can learn the county officials
are either laboring under the impres
sion that state aid is available or will
be granted by some future legislation
and have been building numerous
ditches and charging much of the cost
against state lands benefited. In ad
dition to the ditches many miles of
road have been built under the El
well act and these also have been
charged against the property bene
fited. According to the attorney gen
eral, state lands cannot be assessed
and, while this might be met by
charging the cost to purchasers of
these lands, the assessments only tend
to keep them off the market. Seekers
of state land, he says, will not buy
in Koochiching county because of the
incumbrances named. As to the con
struction of roads they are strictly
an internal improvement and no part
of their cost can be met by tax on
the state treasury.
Some Have Grown Rich.
Practically all the bonds issued by
Koochiching county are in the hands
of private investors. Very little mon
ey has been secured from the state
trust fund. Much of this bonded in
debtedness from all accounts has
been quoted at a high rate of inter
est and at a cost that has greatly en
riched those instrumental in bring
ing about the issue and securing its
sale. There are said to be other ir
regularities, but they are of a minor
nature. There are thousands of acres
of state land in the county, but be
cause of the encumbrances mention
ed sales of these lands have been few.
In the opinion of the attorney gen
eral it may be necessary for the next
legislature to come to the rescue not
only of Koochiching county but of
other counties similarly situated.
273 ACRES SOLD AT
STATE LAND SALE
Two hundred and seventy-three
acres of state land were sold at a
land sale conducted at the court
house this morning by State Auditor
J. A. O. Preus. The proceeds of the
sale were ?1,078.62.
Mr. Preus arrived in Bemidji this
morning and left on the noon train.

THE BEMIDtKr
SEEK SUNDAY TRAINS
ON DULUTH LINE
Grand Forks, N. D., May 10.The
Grand Forks Commercial club has re
newed efforts to have the Great
Northern put on a daily train ser
vice between this city and Duluth.
Over a year ago the Great North
ern discontinued running Nos. 34 and
33 on Sunday and despite all efforts
of commercial bodies and residents
along the road from Grand Forks to
Duluth, they refused to again run
trains on Sunday.
The Sunday service is desired dur
ing the summer season as many local
residents prefer to go to their cot
tages at Maple Lake or Bemidji on
Sunday morning.
M. & I. MOBILIZES
LEGAL FORCES TO
FIGHT NEW ROAD
W. H. Gemmell, General Manager,
Prepares Action to Oppose
Nymore Highway.
WHEN WAR IS DECLARED
WORDS ARE FUTILE, HE SAYS
States That He Believes That the
Citi ,ens of Bemidji Do Not
Understand.
"When war is declared, words are
futuile," said W. H. Gemmell, gen
eral manager of the M. & I. railway
company, last evening while a visitor
in the city. This was his reply to
a question by a Pioneer representa
tive asking him whether or not he
had anything to say about the action
of the city council in deciding to con
struct the Nymore highway up to the
lake shore and to open up Second
street.
"It is for us to act," said Mr. Gem
mell. He stated that the M. & I.
legal forces were mobilized and that
when the city unlawfully interfered
in any way with the company's prop
erty, the railroad company would act
quickly and effectively.
Mr. Gemmell stated that he did not
believe that the citizens of "Bemidji
understood the merits of the contro
versy.
Against Project.
"If the people understood the con
troversy they would certainly not ap
prove of the action of the city coun
cil which will involve the city in
needless delay and expense," said
Mr. Gemmell.
The M. & I., according to a pro
posal made at the council meeting are
willing that the lake shore highway
be constructed on Third street as per
their plans, but will refuse to allow
the opening of Second street. They
prefer the repairing of the present
crossing, which is admittedly dan
gerous.

LAND MENCOMBINE:
BONUSES ARE SMALL
Sale of Government Lands Under
Volstead Act Continues at
Court House.
Land buyers have formed a "com-
bine," or have a "gentlemen's agree
ment" not to bid against one another
for government land under the Vol
stead act, therefore the bonuses paid
at the sale being conducted at the
court house are small.
Lands are being sold for the ditch
liens. ^Practically all the-Jaad is be
ing sold, however. Bonusses go to
the federal government.
This morning the combine was
threatened when an individual buyer
from Minneapolis bid on each piece.
His bidding brought bonuses of from
$10 to $15. A piece of land was
sold to the Minneapolis man and he
then retired from the bidding and
the work of the "combine" continued.
The sale will continue for several
days.

Merchant! association Tuesday
afternoon^ the merchants de
cided thai they would offer spe
cial bargains during the time
that "The Birth of a Nation"
shows in Bemidji. Special ad
vertisements will be prepared
and the bargains will be such
as will attract many people to
this city- Watch this paper for
further announcements.
"The Birth of a Nation" with its
wonderful symphony orchestra of 30
high class artists will be the attrac
tion at the Grand theater in Bemidji
for five days starting on Sunday, May
21, witli matinees daily at 2:30
o'clock and nights at 8:15 o'clock.
The prices for the matinees will be
50c, 75c and $1.00, and for the night
performances 50c, $1.00 and $1.50.
"The Birth of a Nation" may be
generally "covered" as follows:
There are twelve reels of vivid,
realistic spectacles which tell the
story of a double romance, which ex
plains the attitude of the North and
the defense of the stubborn South
over the slave issue, and which carry
one through scenes of the long, cruel
war, its message to the world being
"Liberty and Union, one and insep
erable."
Col. Stoneman of the North is in
love with the sister of Col. Cameron
of the South. And Col. Cameron is
infatuated with the sister of- Col.
Stoneman. These romances are de
picted before the war and the views
show how the drawing of lines and
the commencement of war worked
esstrangemeni^distress and hardship
on the young lovers and members of
their families.
Brave young men embrace their
mothers, sisters and sweethearts and
depart for army service, their emo
tions being depicted in their resolute
faces. The pictures also show pa
triotic women at home sewing and
knitting for the soldiers.
The magic films reveal the inter
iors of Northern and Southern homes.
One sees vast armies mustered to
march away to war.
In a twinkling the scene changes
and the sun shines brightly on a
snowy cotton field in the south, with
scores of negroes of all ages pluck
ing the white blossoms. Festive lit
tle picaninnies caper about and at
nightfall in cabin quarters singing
and dancing are indulged in by the
slaves. Bondage is visualized with its
sorrows and its joys. As the war
progresses great battles are fought
and the thrilling action from rifle fire
to cavalry clashes and artillery duels
is depicted in pictorial form as true
to life as it is possible for human
agency to simulate.
Scenes are unfolded in which fully
18,000 soldiers and 3,000 cavalry, the
largest theatrical army ever assem
bled, are active in the performance
of the good and bad deeds of war
fare. One sees a bayonet charge
with a quiver of excitement and
closes his eyes at the sight of the
dying and dead. Ambulance drivers
arrive to carry away the fallen and
hospitals throw doors open to re
ceive the injured. Gentle burses flit
from cot to cot to minister to the
wants of the patients.
Historic scenes are depicted with
realistic effect, ranging from battle
engagements, such as the battle of
Gettysburg, the siege of Petersburg,
Sherman's march to the sea and the
fall of Atlanta, to events in Wash
ington.
In the pictures Gen. Robert E. Lee
strides forth to clasp the hand of

and according to law is condemned
to die unless he can pay his fine be
fore sundown. Aegeon has come to
Ephesus in seach of his wife, his twin
sons, both named Antipholus, and
their twin servants, the Dromios, who
had all been separated in a ship
wreck years before.
It happens at this same time that
Antipholus of Syracuse, who had un
til a short time before been with his
father, arrives in Ephesus. He is ac
companied by his servant Dromis.
Ephesus is the hom i of the other An
tipholus, and now that the twin
brothers and their twin servants are
both in the same town unknown to
each other, strange mixups result.
Adriana, wife of Antipholus of
Ephesus, mistakes the other brother
for her husband, the twin servants
confuse their masters, and a series of
amusing complications follow.
Finally the twins meet, Antipholus
of Syracuse recognizes his father
Aegeon the abbess is recognized as
Aemilia, the wife of Aegeon and all
ends happily.
