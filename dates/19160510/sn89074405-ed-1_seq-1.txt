Berlin, May 10.—In an engage

between German and British tor
lo *aft, a British destroyer waa
damaged by artillery lire, ac
ig to an official announce
ment by the German artillery.
Bertih, May 10.—"The German
attack on Verdun Is based on the
crushing effect of German licavy
artillery," writes Major Morahl,
military critic of The Tageblatt.
"The capture of the smaller fort
resses in the west at the beginnlr^
of the war by the use of heavy ar
tillery waa only a yretndo to the
artillery operations now In prog
ress. The French have not been
equipped to compete with German
artillery and ammunition. The en
ormous losses of the French are
due partly to the effect of the Ger
man artillery and partly to the ten
acity of the French who will not
leave their trenches. Although it Is
generally considered that the at
tacking forces must be four times
superior to those of the defense, in
the Verdun campaign, the number
of German troops engaged Is much
leas than half that of the FVrench.
Ue number of French troopa may
be calculated at not less than 800,
000, and this Upon represents half
of the entire forces wUch France
«tfl has at her disposal for active
fighting."

This is the Declaration. of
French Journalists, who
Laud Wilson.
IGNORES ALLUSION
TO PEACE SPEECHES
Describe Note as "Master
piece of Diplomacy"—Is
Firm in Tone. '"r
Paris, May 10.—Great prominence
is given by newspapers of' Paris this
morning to the latest American note
to Germany, replying to the German
communication respecting submarine
warfare.
The American note is spoken of as
a masterpiece of diplomacy.
"With conciseness, firmness and
clarity which is in strong contrast to
the pathos with which Wilhelm
strasse announced its backdown,
President Wilson maintains the po
sition he took in the preceding, note,"
writes Stephen Plchon, former minis
ter, in The Petit Journal.
The Matin says that the American
note places Germany in a cruel di
lemma, her suggestions having been
rejected, but her promise restricted
so that they will have to be kept.
"It must be clear to all neutrals
that Germany has suffered ah unpre
cedented diplomatic defeat." it says.
"It will be interesting to see how the
German government explains to the
public that It has consented radically
to modify submarine warfare with
out obtaining the slightest compen
sation in exchange."
One of the most Important points
noted in regard to the American re
ply, in the opinion of The Petit.Pa
risian, is that it ignores the allusion
in the German note to the chancel
lor'a two declarations in the reichstag
in regard to peace negotiations. This
paper says:
"If Emperor William desired to
catch President Wilson in a trap, the
emperor is caught in his own toils.
He has met his master. There re
mains nothing for him to do except
either to'accept the American note at
the risk of loosing the fury of the
German governmental parties or to
take upon himself the initiative in
bringing about a rupttfre which would
entail serious consequences for Ger
niany."v' ..

WILLISTON MAY
GRAVEL STREETS
WHliston. N. D., May 10.—Plans are
being considered by the members of
the city commission for the graveling
of all the Important streets of Willis
ton. First avenue east and other
streets were graveled last season
with excellent results, and the mem
bers of the. commission feel that this
plan will be the best for the main
thoroughfares of the city at the pres
ent time.
The graveling can be done by the
eity at a comparatively low figure
and it is the plan to apportion the
charges against the property directly
benefited. The extent to which the
street improvement work will be car
ried on is not definitely determined,
but all the main business and reel*,
dence streets in' the' central portion
of the city are being' considered.

TROOPS TO
The voyage of the Russians consti
tutes a record in military transport
history for distance and diversity of
route. The soldiers, as already
known, are men specially chosen from
every division of the Russian army.
They were concentrated in Moscow
under the supervision of General
Lochwitzky. who landed with the first
contingent last Thursday and at Mos
cow. entrained for carriage by the
trans-Siberian railroad across nearly
7,500 miles of country to Port Dalyn,
near Port Arthur, whence they were
to start on a sea journey of about
10,000 miles. In time of peace they
would have followed a route in an al
most opposite direction, via Archangel
and westward by the North Sea and
the Atlantic to the Mediterranean.
On this occasion they voyaged
along the coasts of half the eastern
world, the route being from Dalny,
along the Korean shore, then through
the Yellow and Chinese seas and then
reaching Singapore where the trans
ports entered the Indian ocean by the
straits of Malacca. They made their
way by Aden and the Red sea to the
Sues canal and Port .Said,
Otice in the Mediterranean, the
route to: Marseilles was a straight one
as cautionary measures against enemy
submarining would admit. There was
bad weather at one or two periods of,
the voyage but on- the whole, ,th*
transit was unmarked by exciting, in
cidenta The arrival of the 'RusslatU
was a great. surprise to the general'
public in France, their coming- being
known only to officials and to a- few
journalists in-Parte. On the other
hand, the sending .of the contingent
was in all probabilities perfectly well
kriown to the German authorities..
