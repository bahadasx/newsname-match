VOTE "YES" ON THIS ONE
The hard coal miners it is said
are likely to go on a strike. Some
time ago it was announced that
there would be no summer reduc
tion in coal prices such as general
ly applies. With a strike on top
of this it is easy to be seen where
South Dakotans will land when
the coal man gets them next fall.
This ou*ht to be another boost for
the constitutional amendment to
be submitted this fall providing
for giving the state authority to
develop the lignite coal fields of
South Dakota. Every voter should
keep this in mind—especially the
fellow who has to buy coal—and
vote yes next fall.

The Oood Roads bill is probably
postponed for the rest of the pre-
*ont congies?, a*
it came
other legislation. Congress is all
favorable to some good roads leg
islation, but the proposition of a
plan is something there has been
division on. One of the peiui'.i^
measures carried $75.00I\0(IO. The
Shackelford bill provided
0()(i and other measures dill'erei:t
amounts. There can be no don!
as to some kind of measure pass
ing at the next session, if not :t
the prerent. It is up to the people
of So. Dakota to be ready to accept
the provisions of such a measure
when it becomes a law and vote
yes on the amendment this fall
for good roads.—PieneCap.-Jour
nal.
South Dakota may perhaps not
be in the same plight as the bird
with a broken wing," but the effect
of a constitutional provision
which prohibits the State from
engaging in any public work is
practically about the same.
Let us have a constitution that
is up in line with that of other
Progressive States.
II LET THE PEOPLE RULE
R. O. Richards is certainly right
in his primary election law idea,
in making principles instead of
persons the issue, in providing for
abolition of the official spoils sys
tem. in providing for public, joint
debates, so that the people can
hear both sides before thev vote,
in proyiding for minority aud ma-
Judge Roland jority representation to foster a
line-up on the ballot under a prin
ciple so the people can see what
they vote for, as well as to estab
lish majority rule. The primary
election law in government is like
the first corn row in a corn field.
"Get it straight first before we
can straighten what has to follow."
Richards is right—vote "yes"'
for the Richards Primary law at
next November election, and vote
for Richards for Governor at the
Primaries, May 23rd. —(Adv.)

AnpropHntions Lowered.
Touching upon the subject of
state finances the lieutenant, govern
or said he felt that a comparatively
new state such as South Dakota de
manded a broad gauged policy and
a businesslike administration in ev
ery respect and that the legislature
acted wisely in retrenching on ex
penses resulting in a lowering of ap
propriations by over $00,000, and
speaking further upon ihc matter ol
finances, said:
"The other candidate has re
vamped his features used in the two
former unsuccessful campaigns and
is making an active canvass of the
state but seems to be meeting with
but little encouragement. He claims
that there has been a great increase
in state expenditures aud this in the
face of published reports of State
Auditor H. B. Anderson and State
Historian Doane Robinson, both of
which show a remarkable reduction
and a consistent lowering of the per
capita state tax until for 1915 it it
but $2.2 8. He further says there
are 600 useless state officials that
he would dispense with and thus
save to the state $600,000 per year.
As there are less than 200 state of
ficials and the legislature appropriat
ed but $300,230 for their salary and
maintenance In 1915 do not Bee
how he can make this good, but this
is what he promised his audicnce
in
a speech recently delivered in
Falls."
