International News Service:
LONDON, May 10. That German
tubmarines are extending their oper
ations farther and farther into the
Atlantic is shown by the fact that
the White Star freighter Cymric was
torpedoed l:'S miles west of Ireland.
Four men were killed by the ex
plosion of the torpedo. A fifth vic
tim was drowned while leaving the
snip. j
All on board the Cymric were
I'lrlish c itizens, excepting two Bel
gians and a Kussian.
The dx consular passengers on
hoard, .ill of whom were saved, were.
British citizens whose admittance
into the United .-'tates had been re
fused by the immigration authori
ties. They were being- sent back to
Kngland by the British consul in
New York City.

Ireland, where the survivors were
landed, that the attack was without
warning and that the submarine
made no effort to save those on
board the Cymric.
.Captain's Itciort.
Capt. Beadnell's report says:
" n Monday afternoon at 12:r,o
o'clock, when we were eight days
out from New York and Lis miles
trom land, the ship was torpedoed
without warning. The track of the
torpedo was seen by several, but
the submarine was not seen. The ,
torpedo struck the en-'ine room and j
went through the side of the shir, j
exploding- at the far side of the null.
All the skylights were blow n out and
all the lights were blown away. Four
men were killed by the explosion.
They were: H. Morton, sixth stoker;
F. J. Kenney, an oiler; J. B. Watts,
third stoker, ami D. Hergrcn, a
trimmer.
"The chief steward. J. R. Mal
colm, was drowned while leaving
the ship. The balance of the crew,
number 100, were saved. All the
survivors left the ship by taking to
the boats. At S:30 in the afternoon
the seamen returned to the Cymric
and a wireless call for help was sent
cut on an emergency gear which
was ringed up. At ':Z a sloop ar
rived and took off all the survivors.
The sloop stood by until the Cymric
snk. There were no passengers on
the Cymric and all the members of
the crew were British except the
t;.o Belgians and a Kussian. The
Cymric had no gun of any kind
trounted."

The United .States embassy has
legun an investigation into the de
struction of the Cymric. It is con
tended here that Germany cannot
clim that the vessel was attacked
in the "war zone" waters because
the freighter was K'v miles from
land when the torpedo was fired.
