MOBILIZED FOR SERVICE IN
"PROUD DFTHE
GOSPEL" IDEE

ANOTHER OF DR. WILLIAMS'
POWERFUL SERMONS DELIVER
ED TO LARGE CONGREGATION
AT TABERNACLE LAST NIGHT.
"Proud of the Gospel," was the
theme of Dr. Williams' sermon at th?
tabernacle last night, based on Rom
ans 1:16. Some people seem to think
that the Gospel has lost its force to
day. This however is a very narrow,
superficial view. The writer of the
text was one of the most richly en
dowed men in the history of the
world. He was great every wav in
character and most liberally edu
cated. He was a scholar, philosopher,
theologian, religionist, church offi
cial of the highest rank and a great
missionary. Both as a Jew and a
Christian he was intensely aggres
sive and practical. For him to change
from his ancestral faith to that of the
despised Nazarine was the most amaz
ing thing to his friends and corelig
ionists. Likewise the disciple; of
the new faith wondered at his trans
formation, were suspicious of his con
version and were looking for some
new ruse on his part to catch them.
But his conduct proved him to be
sincere in defending the way he once
persecuted. He suffered the loss of
all things and endeared countless
hardships and persecutions. People
thought him crazy to throw overboard
all the prospects that he enjoyed as a
member of the Sunhediim. a mo.-t
brilliant future, sacrifice all his pos
sessions and friends and to devote
his peerless abilities to such a cause
as "Preaching the Gospel." But. he
proudly replied, "I am not ashamed
of the Gospel." Then they demanded
of him that he show cause why he
was not ashamed. He replied that
"It is the power of God unto Salva
tion to every one that believeth."
Men are asking the same question
today and they have a right to do so.
We must answer. We must show
cause why, and this we do by show
ing what the gospel has done in the
past, what it is doing now, and what
it promises to do in the future. The
world had never seen or heard any
thing like the matter, manner or mo
tive of the gospel before it came.
The tender mercies of the heathen
were cruel. An eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth, was the standard
when Jesus came. An oppressive
phariseeism was the prevailing type
of religion when he began to preach.
But he uttered a new gospel of love
and mercy, the forgiveness of our
sins through the grace of our Cod.
Do good unto all men as ye have op
portunity was the spirit of the new
message. This was the highest teach
ing and practice even known. Bear

ALLEGED THAT HE WAS THE
ONE WHO BROKE CLASS IN

JEWELRY TO AMOUNT OF $100.
Since the window in the jewelry
store of J. W. Dorrah was smashed a
few nights ago and a quantity of
jewelry taken the officers have been
on the watch for the perpetrator of
the deed, and yesterday afternoon
their efforts were, rewarded when of
ficer Dow Braziel succeeded in locat
ing and recovered a part of the stolen

lows: It seems that young Morgan

THIS IS TRE
LAST DAY YOU
CAN REGISTER
UNLESS VOTERS GET NAMES EN
ROLLED BEFORE MIDNIGHT,
THEY WILL BE DISFRANCHISED.
DEMOCRATS IN CITY SLOW.
When the hour of midnight arrives
tonight all who have failed to register
their names according to the provi
sions of the last legislature, will be
denied the ballot in the primary and
the gpnwal election this fall. Reports
from the country precincts state that
the democrats have registered nearly
all the voters of that party, but the
same cannot bo said of the city pre
cincts, as t he registers report that It
seems to be a matter of the slightest
indifference to many democrats us to
whether they register or not, and they
will only realize their mistake when
they attempt to vote this fail and the
ballot Is denied them.
The precinct registers have not on
ly worked hard, but' they have made
many sacrifices to get the voters to
register, they have succeeded in some
instances to find parties who were at
work and getting their names, while
in many instances they have failed
to find their men and as the men will
not come to them, the chances are
that they will be disfranchised.
"I think this registration law Is a
joke," said one party man yesterday,
but this same man will not find it to
'be a joke when he attempts to cast a
ballot this fall unless he changes ills
mind and registers before midnight to
night.. "Tell the voters through the paper
that I want them to register tonight
before it is too late, we are going to
need every democratic vote this fall,
and I want Carter county to roll up a
bigger majority than ever before," said
Mr. Dunlap this morning, and his
warning should be heeded by all who
have the Interest of the party at heart.
