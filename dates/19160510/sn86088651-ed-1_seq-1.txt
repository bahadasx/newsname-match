SPOKE IN PALESTINE
On Motion of Mayor Speech Ordered
Printed and a Copy 8ent to
Every Farmer.
Probably a hundred or more of An
derson County's most progressive
farmers were here today, guests of
local business men at a luncheon at
tbe Redlands hotel from 12 to 2:30
o'clock. Tbe object of tbe meeting
and luncheon was to get tbe people
of the town and county together and
discuss the advisability of bringing
farmers' short course to this county
the last week In June.
Hon. W. C. Campbell was toast
master and also made a good talk on
harmonizing the Interests of the town
and country, and his remarks were
to the point and were fully appre
ciated, The toaatmaster then introduced Tl.
L. McKnlght of the extension depart
ment of the A- k M. College, who ex
plained the Ideas Involved In the short
course program, and who also spoke
of the relations of the farmers to the
towns and to the work the A. ft M.
Is doing. Mr. McKnlght Is not an
orator; he does not need to be. The
man who really bas a message Just
needs to dllver his message. And
Mr. McKnlght certainly has a message
snd knows how to make It effective.
He knows exactly what he is talking
about He doesn't lose a lot of time
sympathizing with the "poor down
trodden farmer," for tbe simple rea
son, we are sure, that he does not be
lieve there Is any such thing. But his
message Is optimistic and helpful, and
full of Inspiration.
It Is planned to have a fire days'
short course, giving one day to each
of five county communities. And
from the interest indicated today by
the men present it Is going to be ex
ceedingly hard to decide on any par
tlcular five communities.
A number of other gentlemen spoke
on relative subjects, but the lateness
of the hour prevents a more detailed
report of the meeting at this time.
Palestine Herald.
At the close of Mr. McKnlght's ad
dress the mayor of Palestine, Mr.
Ceo. A. Wright made a motion, and
the name carried, that the apeerh be
printed In full and mailed to every
farmer In the county.
