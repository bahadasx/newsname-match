Break Averted
President May Accept Kai
H scr's Assurance ami
Await Outcome.
Washington. May, ? ;.?The
probability that a diplomatic
break with ''Germany has been
Evened, at least temporarily,
was strengthlioljd today when
.the official ttbet of 11?*? German
Rite, laid la l'oie President Wil?
son and secretary Lansing, was
found to tie almost iudenticul
with the unollicial version pub?
lished yesterday.
?' OMicials bad indicated that
Bhunhi the ollicial lOXl le'tir Otlt
the unollicial version, they
thought it improbable diplo?
matic relations would have to
be severed, unless further til
tacks upon merch'anl shijis
Violated the new pledges.
Disappointment has boon in?
dicated, however, over certain
features of the Uormtlil reply
and some high olllcittls believe
that, it at least cannot he accept
cd unconditionally,
Opinion as to whether the
note requires tin nnswer Beems
divided. Decisions rests with
the president, who so far has
not indicated to any one his
liuul judgment in the matter. It
is entirely possihle that no re?
ply will he sent, for the present
tit least, and that the President
will mantain complete Biloucc
for a time, allowing Germany
to demonstrate the good faith
of her intention to carry out the
policy indicated hi her new or?
ders to submarine commanders,
Although the president real?
izes that the promises given arc
the cardinal elements Of the
note, he is understood to be dis?
pleased over the language used
and the conditions apparent!)
attached.
.-ie.nl I the note he accepted
as satisfactory and reply sent
it is expected id take the form
of a notification t<> Germany
that the United States has de
cided not to sever diplomatic
relations as long as the now
submarine orders remain effec?
tive and are observed.
Secretary Lansing left to?
night to spend the week end at
Annapolis, taking with him an
ollicial copy of the Geriunh
note, lie expects to have full)
digested its statements by the
time of his return Monday.
Persons close to all'airsnt the
White House, today described
President Wilson as feeling he
could not question Germany'^
good faith unless the declara?

fective.

The official text of the Ger?

day by the State Department.
Atnbnssubor Gerard, in trans
milting the document said be
had received copies in hoth

APP?LACHIA WINS BASE
BALL PENNANT.
By Defeating Big Stone Gap
Arc Declared Champions
ol Wise County.
In the final game of the In
tiTseholustic League of Wise
County, Appnlucbiii badly do
fedted Big Stone (lap here Sat
urday afternoon by a score of
12 to I, thereby winning the
base ball pennant, having won
all games played. The defeat
was a severe one and in fact it
was a surprise, as a close game
was expected by everybody.
The home team hud borne the
reputation of having the faster I
fielding team in the league, hut
ill this particular game they
fell down completely, misjudg?
ing several fly balls which went
for extra liases. However, this
wtis not duo to their defeat, as
Appdlncliid'a pitcher, Cress,
hurled a masterly game, being
extremely effective in pinches.
Big Stone (lap tilled the l>a.-es
with runners several times in
the early part of the game, hut
were unable to score only one
time. The bases were still full
and two out in the second in
ning after making this score,
the next hatter bad three balls
and no strikes. un? Cress punch,
ed him. dress featured also
with a home run to center field
in the ninth with a man on
base. Tin) ball went straight
for tile center fielder, but was
misjudged and it rolled far into
deep center. Brown, Wakin
and P?lly secured extra base
hits, which figured heavily in
the scoring. Although there
were about twelve errors piled
up by the home team, CarneS
and Fleelior featured at second
and third bases by their fast
fielding, accepting several diill
cult chancos.
The Norton girls won the vol?
ley ball pennant, defeating
their opponents in every game.

Il lias long been known that
Utes breed in manure hut pre?

One half pound of powdered

of water is s'uflicicnt to kilt the

should be sprinkled carefully

llhakes thi) cost of tin.' treat?

the output of manure is two
Uusiiels a day per horse. The

In larger quantities, however,
or when the manure itself, is

to crops may result. Large
quantities of manure are often
used by market gardeners and
others, and there is always dan

therefore recounnenod for the

Good Coal Year
In Virginia.
The production of codi in
Virginia in 1915, according to
figures compiled by the I'nitoil
States Geological Suijv'ay in co?
operation with tho Virginia
Geological Survey, was 8,122,
:>:?< short tons, valued at $7,
D03,93l. This is an increase
compared^ with 101-1 of I03,u<;i
tons, or 2 per cent, in qunillity,
but a decrease of $G9,5l4, or loss
than l per cent, in value. With
the exception of the "banner
your,'1 1913, when the produc?
tion was more than 8,800,000
tons, the Output in 1916 was the
highest rocordeil for Virginia,
Wi.-e Goiihty, the largest pro?
ducer, showed a decrease of
more than 100,000 tons, bill all
the other counties recorded in
c reuses.
During tlio early months of
the year coal mining was in?
active, but in August the de?
mand for'both coal and coke
became stronger, and by tho
end of the year the production
was reported up to capacity
and limited only by shot tage of
labor and cars. The completion
of the Southern Railway's
modern coal-loading pier at the
port of Charleston, S. C, and
(he establishment of rates and
port charges for coal from
southwestern Virginia equal to
those for coal from the I'oca
hontns field ?f w est Virginia
to Hampton Bunds piers gave
an additional impetus to pro
duct ion in that part of the
State.
Tin re was a decreased in the
number of moil employed, from
9,18 t in 191 1 to 8,909! in 1915,
but the average number of days
for each man, 2:10, was the same
in both years. 'The average
number of tons produced per
man during the year was 907,
compared with 607 in 191 I, and
the average output per man per
day increased from 3.09 to 3.89
tons. Tlio proportion of coal
mined by band decreased from
is to :l per cent, but tho propor?
tion mined by machines in?
creased from .'d to i;:! per cent.
Tho quantity of washed coal in?
creased from ,M,'.i71 tons in I'.'ll
to 1781525 tons in 1915;

ness.
Tbero is a state license re?
quired of all such dealers and
the Judge of tin- District t'oe.rl

lion 09 of the general tax law
defines the business and states
tin- requirements.
There must be a. sign "Licens?
ed Junk Dealer" above the
door; there must bo no busi?
ness done between the hours of
sunset and sunrise; a complete
record must be kept of each
transaction made a.id the of?
ficers of the law are permitted
to search the place at all hours
without seareli warrants.
There is also a corporation
license tax of J?b.OU a year

town, and any person conduct
iug such business within the
town limits without license is
subject to a lino of $25.00 to

Tho more common articles

and it is unlawful to deal in
them without a junk dealer's

Humorous
Verdicts.
Many verdicts of a strange
curious and humorous nature
dud hirth, not infrequently, in
coroner's juries and juries in
tho justice courts.
Uncommonly intelligent aro
t he coroner's juries in Mississip?
pi. Twelve men in Warren
county, in that state, returned a
verdict several years ago which
rend: 'The deceased died by tho
will of (led or some other di
sense unknown to the jury."
Another verdict equally as
solemn reads as follows: "Wo
are of A Pinion that the dccosl
mot her death from Violent In
fir mat ion of tho Arm, producest
from Tunau CaUJS."
An old story, often repeated,
is that and Knglish jury, in a
criminal case, one brought in
the following: "Guilty, with
i imo little doubt as to whethor
he is the tnntt."
Another is told of a Welsh
jury which reads: "We lind the
man who stold the mare not
guilty."
In a Southwest Virginin
court some yours ago tho case
in question involved a mill site
and dam in a small stream.
Tho jury's verdict was that:
"Brown has a dam by a mill
site; but Jones has no mill dam
site."
A case was once tried in a
certain county court, which in?
volved the character of a bull.
11 w is charged that the bull had
gored and killed a valuable
horse, After hoaring the testi?
mony, the jury retired, and nf
tet' a few moments' consulta?
tion returned and rendered tho
following: "We the jury, find a
vredict in favor of the bull,
and believe him to be a highly
respectatdo animal." Thus, the
bull was acquitted and plaintiff
lost his case.
A Western judge is said to
have once in the pioneer days
addressed a jury: "Von kin,, go
out now and lind a verdict. If
you can't lind one of your own,
got the one the last jury lihcd."
When the jury returned, tho
verdict was read by the fore?
man as follows: "Suicide in tho
ninth degree."
Probably the most amusing
is that one from Alabama. A
man named Smith became
liungiy and to!e his neighbor's
pig. Ilo was caught and tried
later. The jury brought in a
verdict of "guilty of hog sleilin'
in fust degree." The judge
told them to go back and assess
the value of t he stolen property.
They returned with tho follow?
ing verdict. "We, the jury,
pusilanimously find the defend?
ant gilty in the sum of 1 dollar
and 1 in favor of the hog."?
