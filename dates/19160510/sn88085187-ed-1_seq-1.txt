EXPLOSION STARTS
MYSTERIOUS FIRE
The police and fire marshal to
day are investigating a myster
ious fire which destroyed the
North Star apartment house,
191 9 *_: South Tacoma avenue,
last night owned by .Mrs. Violet
Miller.
Tlie fire immediately followed
an explosion in tlie building and
did $i;,.i"mi damage.
Mrs. Milier spent the night
with her mother at Milton and
did not know of tlie fire, she
says, until this morning.
A few paint cans were found
near the switch box on the second
floor. It is impossible to determ
ine if the fire started from spon
taneous combustion from oil
soaked rags, or from faulty wir
ing.
Fire Marshal ('haulier said th.
fire wasrayjdently not of incen
diary nature. He was at a loaa,
however, to explain the explo
sion. A gas meter would not
make a report as loud as the one
which the neighbors heard, he
said. One small hoy told Detec
tive Smith that there were a
number of reports.
Mrs. Miller said she owned the
furniture in the building and had
It covered by $2,000 insurance.

lng. He is in Idaho.
Six families moved out of the
apartment house two weeks ago
while the place was heing repair
ed, and Mrs. Miller was the only
person who had heen living there.
She had planned to reopen the
place today.
The cause of the explosion and
the fire is a mystery. It is
thought perhaps the gas meter
blew up. The flames spread rap-
Idly and were beyond control
when Ihe fire apparatus arrived.
Nearby buildings were threat
ened for a time. The doors of
the building were locked. The
explosion occurred at 9:li">.
H. J. McGregor, superintend.'.it
of streets, who visited the place
at 8:30 to repair the sidewalk,
says he tried to get into tlie
building, but found the doors
locked and the shades pulled
down.

LAWYERS
WOMEN
Today's session of the. state's
case against Joseph Md'askey,
mayor of Wllkeson, charged with
violating the dry law, developed
into a fight between attorneys for
McCaskev and the state as to
whether the characters ot three
women, who testified ihey
bought li.-uor from the defendant
could lie attacked or not. The
state won.
Judge Gordon, attorney for
McCaskev, claimed that two of
the women had lived at the Pal
ace hotel under various names,
lie said that It was necessary
that the defense be allowed to
show the characters of the wom
en to impeach their veracity as
witnesses. I
Unearth
Vicious
System
Sending his first message to
the city council, Controller Fred
Shoemaker today notified the
commission that he had unearth
ed a "vicious and dangerous"
practice indulged In by the Pierce
county auditor and authorized by
a recent state law. - ;•'
Shoemaker declared that thW
county had deducted $1,179.7 ft
from the tax money sent to the
city hall as the city's share of the
county tax. Of this sum |r,l__
was for the salary of expert ac
countants who checked the city
books at $S a day, and $11.75
was for the railroad fare of a
state accountant from Spokane to
Tacoma.
"This vicious and dangerous
law allows the county officials to
make charges against the city*
and to collect the money, without
any notice to us, or any author
ity for the action," said Shoe
maker. "The city is powerless.
The money is simply taken away
from us without our consent."
The council placed the matter
in the hands of City Attorney
Harmon, with request that he
determine whether or not the
city can put an end to the prac
tice. The city had already infus
ed to pay the railroad bill, but
the county arbitrarily forced It
lo pay. City officials knew noth
ing of it until a month or mora
after the money, had been paid.
