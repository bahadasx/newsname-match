Curtain of Fire Teutons Continue toShell Russians at
Ikskull Bridgehead A Stubborn Turkish Attack in Ar
menia Was Put Down by the Russian Forces With Heavy
Casualties Vigorous Artillery Activity on the Macedon
ian Front is Reported.
The French . and German for ceo
fighting northwest of Verdun appar
ently for the moment at least are
deadlocked, the Germans being unable
to advance further and French at
tempts to expel the invaders from
captured positions being unavailing.
East and northeast of Verdun, where
respectively violent infantry attacks
and bombardments have character
ized the recent fighting, only intermit
tent cannonading is now going on.
The only Infantry engagement re
ported anywhere along the French
front was launched by the Germans
against a French trench to the west
of Hill S04, northwest of Verdun. The
French, however, brought into play
their curtain of fire arid the Germans
were unable to debouch.
The shelling by the Germans of the
Russians at the Ikskull bridgehead on
the eastern battle line, which has been
in progress for many- days, still con
tinues. There has been artillery ac
tivity on various other sectors of the
Russian front, but no important in
fantry manoeuvers have been report
ed. - -
The Russians in Armenia, however,
have put down with heavy casualties
a stubborn Turk attack and south
eastward, in the region of Mush, driv
en the- Ottoman forces from their de
fences in a mountain chain. In addi
tion the Russians operating westward
from the Persian frontier toward Bag

The Gorizia bridgehead and the re

theatre have been heavily
bombarded. At San Martino, Vienna
asserts that the Italians suffered
heavy losses through the explosion of
an Austrian mine. Bombardments
have featured the fighting on -the oth
er sectors of this front.
Despatches received in Paris from
Saloniki are to tho effect that there
haa been vigorous artillery activity
on the Macedonian front. An Athens

Federal Trade Commission Threatens
to Make Investigation.
Washington. May 9. -The federal
trade commission announced today that
if there was any further raise in the
price of anthracite coal the commis
sion would take up with the depart
ment of Justice the question of an in
vestigation of the anthracite industry.
The department had suggested the in
quiry If prices are raised following the
wage advance just given to anthracite
workers. -. :
The commission made public in con
nection with its announcement a letter
deplying to the department's sugges
tion for an investigation. - This sug
gestion, signed by Attorney General
Gregory, called attention to price raises
that - have followed other wage ad
vances in the past, and said: v ,
In view of these facts. I take tne
liberty of sueeestinar that if the ad
vance In wasrea lust atrreed on shall be
followed, as in the' post, by an increase
in the price of coal to the consumers,
the federal trade commission will, under
authority of section 6 of the act cre
ating it, institute a searching investi
gation in the operations and accounts
or the .great producing companies for
the purpose of ascertaining all the
facts - upon which such increase in
price may be based. Including the re
lation between any increase in the cost
of production due to advance of wages
and the increase of profits caused by
the increase in price.
The trade commission replied:
"If the situation should develop as
you suggest, the commission will be
glad to take the matter tip with you
further, with a view to making such
investigation as the public interest may
require. . . .
It ' has been stated in ' the public
press,, with apparent authority," the at
torney general wrote the commission,
that, having agreed to an advance in
wages, the railroad - coal companies
will now use thait as- an excuse for
materially increasing the' price of an
thracite coal to the consumers. '
It has been bt.erht out in various
legal proceedings against-the anthra
cite roads that on similar occasions in
the past, when wages have been ad
vanced, the railroad coal companies, on
the pretext or Increasing prices for the
purpose of meeting the increased cost
of production resulting from higher
wages, have made much greater in
creases than were necessary for that
purpose. " ; - -

COMPROMISE LOOKED FOR
ON ARMY REORGANIZATION.
Conferees of Senate nad House Will
Renew Deliberations Today.
Washington, May 9. Agreement on
the army reorganization bm was in
sight tonight. Conferees of the senate
and house, who will renew delibera
tions tomorrow, expect to be able to
reach "a compromise eo that the first
of the big defense measures may be
on the president s aesk next week.
That the senate conferees would
have to surrender the volunteer army
reserve of 261,000 men, which the
house so strongly repudiated yester-
aay, was admitted tonight by senate
leaders, but they hope to strengthen
the provision of the house bill author
izing, citizen instruction camps so that
military training for thousands of citi
zens may be afforded and a nucleus of
a volunteer army thus be built up. The
senate conferees believe it would be
useless to hold out longer for the vol
unteer army in view of the house in
sistence that the national guard should
constitute the main reserve military
defence force.
Under the house bill as it stands
thousand of civilian training camps
must be instituted under direction of
the secretary of war.

tonight praised President Wilson and
uis aanunisirauon - ana assailed in
caustic language' those who have cri
ticised the president and his acts.
: ' Slandering Public Officials.
Mr. Cummings said that "such are
the necessities of partisanship that
politicians who placed party and- not
America first are criticising the ad
ministration, maligning the president,
slandering our public officials and hys
terically calling for a change in lead
ership." - , - , . -
He said that a characteristic form
of criticism . was to be found in the

republican convention an address
which he thought was not a piece of
"constructive statesmanship." -
' Analyzed McLean's Address.
' Mr. Cummings analyzed Senator
McLean's address and paragraph by
paragraph, replied to it, claiming that
the senator from this state gave voice
to "destructive criticisms" and offered
"no definite policy indicating what al
ternative course the administration
could have pursued which would have
more completely accorded with,, the
dignity and traditions of America."
' Praised President Wilson. "
The president, was praised for keep
ing lthe nation out of war and the
speaker pointed out that America's
mission is one of humanity and peace.
"As the white hot events of today
pass into the cool of yesterday's his
tory," Mr. Cummings said, "it will be
found that when a crisis again came
to America and men were distraught
and ' counsels confused, an all-wise
Providence gave to the nation another
Lincoln; and that amid a world of
turbulent spirits and swift and sur
passing change, he stood undisturbed
and steadfast, with no rival who could
hope to reach the serene heights of his
intellectual and moral power-tower
ing above them all the first citizen of
the civilized world." t
The convention in Music Hall was
late , in starting. - The speaker's desk
was Sag-draped and over it was sus
pended a large portrait of President
Wilson. State Chairman David E,
Fitzgerald called to order and intro
duced . Mr. Cummings. At the outset
and repeatedly during his address Mr.
Cummings was heartily a.pplauded.
Many of his references to President
Wilson brought out cheers as well as
handclapping. Spontaneous laughter
followed : the speaker's references to
Theodore Roosevelt and his discover
ies and . ripples of laughter ran
through the hali when the names of
John T. King and J. Henry Roraback
were mentioned. - '
Upon concluding the audience burst
