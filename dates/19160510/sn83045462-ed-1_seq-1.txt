FLURRY IS CAUSED
IN RIGGS BANK TRIAL
Important Papers Taken From
Clerk's Office Contrary to
Rules, Is Claim. '
SEVERAL APPEALS MADE
TO COURT FOR RULINGS
Contentions of Defendant Attorneys
Invariably Sustained?Stanchfield
Many Times Interrupted.
Joint trial of three officials of the
T;isr s>- National Bank on perjury
charges in Criminal Division 1, Justice
Kredorick K. Siddons presiding, was enliveiled
today by several appeals to the
court for ruling. Invariably the contentions
of the defendant attorneys
v ere sustained.
An interesting flurry was caused by
Attorney William G. Johnson, for the
defense, who, in questioning a witness,
brought out the fart that papers in relation
to the case, including the affidavits
of the defendant officials, which
are a basis for the trial, were taken
l'rom the clerk's office, which is contrary
to rules, unless receipted for.
This trial of Charles J. Glover, president;
William J. Flather. vice presi-!
dent, and Henry H. Flather. former
cashier, respectively, of the Kiggs National
Bank, on individual and joint indictments
of perjury, is attracting j
widespread attention and the court- |
room is crowded at each session.
With the conclusion by Attorney John
II. Stanchfield of his presentation of the j
cast; to the jury, for the defense, at
11 :-5 a.m.. and the swearing in of four
witnesses, including Milton E. Ailes, a |
vice president of the Riggs National
Bank, the trial gained headway.
Several times during his address to the
jury Attorney Stanchfield was interrupted
by protests from the government attorneys,
who claimed he was arguing the
case instead of making a statement of
what the defense hopes to prove. After
argument, he was allowed by the court
to proceed.
Mr. Statu hfield's principal contention
was that the affidavits as drawn, which
are a basis for the perjury charges under
trial were intended to convey that the
Kiggs National Bank?for itself?djd not
MU} UI Sell SIUCK9.
Called by Government.
The witnesses railed by the government
H:id sworn, each l>ejng asked if he had
brought certain papers as required in the
subpoenas are:
Herbert A. Hand, CS Wall street. New
York.
Henry L. Fullerton, 100 Broadway, New
"Fork.
Milton H Ailes, a vice president of the
ICiggs National Bank.
Frauk E. Cunningham, assistant clerk
of the District Court of Appeals.
Messrs. Hand and Fullerton had been
asked in the subpoena duces tecum to
produce certain shares of stock and original
letters from Eewis Johnson & Co. to
ih?- stock brokerage firms in New York
of Post & Flagg and Thomas .L. Manson.
etc.
Mr Ailes was asked if he had produced
all of the records as required by sub- ;
poena. He replied that he had produced j
all that could be found, stating that he I
thought an error had been made in ask-j
ing for some, as they do not exist.
Asked to Identify Kecords.
Mr. Cunningham was asked to identify
U'.K Kei anu recoras in me equity suit, ne |
said it was all there except one paper. !
Assistant United States Attorney James
K Archer handed him a paper and asked
if that was not the missing paj>er. He
identified it. It was the affidavits of the
defendant bankers.
Attorney William 'I. Johnson, for
the defense, challenged Mr. Cunningham
as to his recollections regarding
the filing of the affidavit and who had
delivered it to the clerk for filing arid
a:- to where the files are kept. Mr.
Johnson questions showing that the
g jvemment attorneys had had these
papers outside of the clerk's office. He
asked if there was not a rule against
taking an> official papers outside the
clerk's office.
Assistant United States Attorney
Archer asked the court that the hill in
? i iit\ he allowed in court that it might
h?- read to the jury.
Utoincv Johnson objected to the admission
of this bill in equity if it is
t.? he *'Iiinit'*d in effect." He contended
that if it is brought in ir must be in
videncc for reference and use by the
defense as well as the prosecution. He
said h?- takes this as an appropriate
time to ask the jury that this or other
papers presented are not in evidence of
i h?- facts stated therein and only that
papers containing these statements have
>?< ? !) filed. The court thus advised the
j : ; . Tii" toll iri equity was admitted.
j,wor*- .vi . \r?-ner hail finished readi
^ papers, court was adjourned
at ) ;u to reconvene at 1:15. The ent
.:? afternoon session was consumed in
reading the bill in equity.
Stopped Stock Transactions.
John H. StanchfieJd, in resuming hi*
opening statement to the jury this
morning, said the Rlggs National Bank
voluntarily stopped all transactions in
stocks, bonds and real estate loans for
its customers on the passage of the
federal reaerve bank law. This referred
to the metho'ls of buying and
selling for depositors which was criti
is? d b> I'nited States Attorney I-aske*
in his opening statement. This
cessation, he said, was not because
such bus%t ess was improper, but the
whole matter was gone over in interMews
with the controller.
He said that in spring of 1915 Controller
J. S Williams had "threatened"
to impose upon this bank fines amounting
to $150,000 In addition to these
flues this hank had been obliged to de
posit 111 in* ' :11' e?i .naii-H i real!ury
certain government bonds securing
I h:ik/ notes On these bonds were paid
interest. Th-re were on these bonds
J .*>.000 interest due. The controller
threatened to confiscate this $.'>,000 for
the United Stares Treasury.
"In an ir terview in the office of the
controller the officials were told the
Treasury intended to withdraw from
the Kiggs National Bank all deposit!
then* bills of I'anarna funds and other
deposits.
"i'out roller Williams also effected a
withdrawal of the lied < Toss funds.
' J n spite of the stress of the wintei
\ hen ? onditions in Kurope caused uneasiness
regarding financial affairs?
notwithstanding these heavy withhrawals.
this fUggs National Bank waa
able to stand on its own yesources.
"That action caused the officials of thi
bank to l>elieve the controller was deliberately
endeavoring to wreck this greal
financial institution.
"Therefore, on advice of counsel. tin
fh'ials had recourse to the courts to ol>
lain relief through an injunction restrain

hOXDON. May 10.?The execution of
the leaders of the Sinn Fein revolt continues
to exercise gravely the minds of
tlie nationalists. Arthur Lynch, nationalist
member of parliament for the county
of Clare, in a statement today on behalf
of his party, says:
"In the best interests of the allies and
the conduct of war Englishmen should
put aside everv other feeling and recognize
the harm already done by shootings
after the insurrection has been entirely
quelled. Not only should the shootings
entirely cease, but the proclamation of
martial law should be immediately revoked
and matters allowed to resume
normal conditions as soon as possible.''
Shaw Defends Irish Rebels.
George Bernard Shaw*, discussing the
executions of the Sinn Feiners, in an
open letter today, says:
"My view is that men who were shot
in cold blood after their capture or surj

therefore entirely incorrect to slaughter
them.

COAL PRICE PROBE
NOWIH PROSPECT
Federal Trade Commission
Promises Inquiry if Anthracite
Quotations Go Higher.
OPERATORS ANNOUNCE
INCREASE FOR JUNE 1
Give Granting of Wage Demands
and Other Adjustments as
Reasons for Action.
Why hard coal goes up in price to
the consumer every time the miners
get a raise in pay will be the subject
of an inquiry by the federal trade commission.
The commission has served
notice to all whom it may concern.
In an announcement the commission
declares that if there is a further rise
in the price of anthracite coal it will
take up with the Department of Justice
the question of an investigation of the
anthracite industry. The Attorney
General Is responsible for the suggestion
that an inquiry be made if prices
are raised following the wage advance
just granted to the anthracite workers.
Inquiry Is Suggested.
The commission has made public the
communication of the Attorney General,
which calls attention to price advances
that have followed wage increases
in the past. He then sugggests
the inquiry under the authority of section
6 of the act creating the commission,
proposing:
"A searching investigation into the
operations and accounts of the great
producing companies, for the purpose
ui d.vri idiiiuig aii uic jai i.i u|?/ii
such increase in price may be based,
including the relation between any increase
in the cost of production due to
advance of wages and the increase of
profits caused by the increase in price."
Anthracite producers have put a surtax
of $12,000,000 annually on consumers
since the 1912 wage .increase, the
Attorney General wrote, through a price
increase of 16 cents a ton over cost increase.
The letter called attention to
three wage increases in sixteen years
and resulting price increases. A wage
increase of 10 per cent in October. 1900,
the Attorney General said, increased
cost of production to the Philadelphia
and Heading Coal and Iron Company
15.6 cents a ton. but its coal prices were
raised soon afterward 23.2 cents a ton.
Other Increases Cited.
A general wage advance of 14 per
cent in November, 1902, which increased
cost of production, according to
the Attorney General, only 13.3 cents a
ton, was followed by a raise in prices
of 49.4 cents a ton. Prices immediately
following this wage increase were influenced
by a scarcity of coal, due to a
long strike, said the Attorney General,
but prices two years later still were
24.3 cents higher than the cost increase
that came w ith the wage advance.
In 1912 a wage increase of 9 cents a
ton was followed by a rise of 25 rents a
ton in prices. In response to a House
resolution the Department of I,abor in\estigated
this increase and reported
that "the prices realized by the coal
mining companies were increased about
16 cents a ton more than was required
by the new scale of wages alone."
Prices to Go Higher.
NEW YORK. May 10.?Circulars announcing
advances in the wholesale
price of anthracite coal have been approved
by anthracite operators, and
were sent to retail dealers today.
The increases, which, according to
one circular, range from 15 cents a ton
for egg to 50 cents a ton for pea coal,
follow upon the announcement by the
operators that they would advance the
price of coal to meet the additional
cost of wage increases and other adjustments
recently allowed the miners,
other than to express surprise, none
of the operators here would comment
upon the announcement of the federal
trade commission.
In Effect June 1.
According to the circular, a first advance
goes into effect June 1. and the
final increase becomes effective September
1 and throughout the fall and
winter. The June I prices show advsirweM
u t tirlpu'ntpr N!ni? Vnrl, nf i :
cc-nts a ton for e?R coal, 20 cents for
chestnut, 20 cents for buckwheat No. 1,
40 cents for stove and 50 cents for pea.
The schedule follows:
Broken coal, $4.95; eg", $5.05; stove,
$5.30; chestnut. $5.35; pea, $3.65; buckwheat.
No. 1, $2.95. and boiler, $2.25.
Ten cents per ton will be added to
the prices of egg, stove, chestnut and
pea coals on the 1st of June, July, August
and September, making the winter
schedule as follows:
Egg, $5.45; stove, $5.70; chestnut,
$5.75. and pea, $4.09.
The price for the other coals remains
stationary.

BERLIN, May 10, by wireless to Sayville.?The
Germans have made further
progress on Hill 304, on the Verdun
front, and have driven back French detachments
southeast of the hill, the war
office statement of today says. The
text of the official statement follows:
"In the Argonne the enemy, after a
mining operation, attempted to enter
our lines, but was repulsed.
"Southwest of Hill 304 advanced detachments
of the enemy were driven
farther back. One detachment was captured.
The new German positions on
Hill 304 were extended.
"German airmen dropped numerous
bombs on factories at Dombasle (Argonne)
and Raon l'Etape (Vosges)."
*
Big Guns Clear Way.
"The German attack on Verdun is
based t>n the crushing effect of German
heavy artillery," writes Maj. Moraht,
military critic of the Tageblatt. "The
capture of the smaller fortresses in the
west at the beginning of the war by
the use of heavy artillery was only a
preiuae to me aruuery operations now
in progress.
"The French have not been able to
compete with German artillery and ammunition.
The enormous losses of the
French are due partly to the effect of
the German artillery and partly to the
tenacity of the French, who will not
abandon their trenches.
Germans Greatly Outnumbered.
"Although it is generally considered
)that attacking forces must be four
times superior to those of the defense,
in the Verdun campaign the number
of German troops engaged Is much less
JO than half that of the French. The numltl
ber of French troops may be calculated
at not less than 800,000. This figure
represents half of the entire forces
which France still has at her disposal
me for active fighting.
"All the German successes on the
eastern and western fronts were gained
with numerically inferior forces. Moreover,
the Austro-Hungarian troops for
a year have been holding back twice
their number of the enemy. The principal
elements in victory?quality of
rt~ troops and courage ? are steadily
up working to our advantage."

CONFIDENT ON BORDER
OF EARLY AGREEMENT
Obregon and Scott Expected to Make
Arrangement Ignoring Time
Limit for Withdrawal.
TO HOLD ANOTHER SESSION
At San Antonio and Columbus Acttv
ity Is Renewed in Preparation
for Additional Troops Authorized
by President.
EL PASO, Tex., May 10 ?
Gen. Pershing has been ordered
to begin a greater concentration
of his troops. Those detashments
still operating as far south
as San Antonio, it was reported,
will be withdrawn to Colonia
Dublan.
No answer had been received
early today from Washington to
Gen. Scott's message reporting
Gen. Obregon's proposal for a
joint patrol of the internatioanl
boundary.
Gen. Scott said today's conference will
be held regardless of whether a reply
was received to the plan of the Mexican
minister of war.
Increasing confidence in the ability of
Gens. Scott and Obregon to effect an
agreement as to the status of the
American punitive expedition in Mexico
was evident on both sides of the Rio
Grande, notwithstanding the situation
was not materially altered by the conferees
in their three-hour talk last
night.
Basis for the Optimism.
The optimism appeared based largely
upon the admission that another conference
would be held, and that Gen.
Obregon and his military advisers maintained
attitudes of hopefulness.
The net result of the conferences already
held is that the Mexican representatives
yet insist upon placing the
question of the withdrawal of Gen.
Pershing's forces ahead of the question
of co-operation.
Gen. Scott was expected to receive
from the War Department a communl
i - ?nmiM ho Aa.
livered to Gen. Obregon's counter-proposal
for a joint patrol of the border
by the troops of each country on Its
own side of the line. With this agreed
to Gen. Obregon believed that co-operation
in the running down of bandits
that raided across the line might be
more effective.
Obregon May Consult Carranza.
When the conference will take place
today was unknown either at Gen.
Obregon's headquarters or at Gen.
Scott's. Because of the new phases
suggested by Gen. Obregon it was believed
probable that he would consult
with Carranza, and that delays in communicating
with the Mexican capital
might make the holding of the conference
before tomorrow impossible.
The ordering into the border country
of more regular troops and militia appeared
not to worry Gen. Obregon and
those military men with him, nor did
Juan N. Amador, subsecretary of foreign
affairs, appear perturbed. They
assumed that the increasing of the
forces along the border to an army of
almost 50,000 to be solely for the protection
of towns on the American side,
and laughed at suggestions that any*
thing more serious might be contemplated.
Renewed Activity at Columbus.
COLUMBIA'S, N. M? May JO.?Renewed
activity in almost every department of the
expeditionary base was apparent here today.
Men are being sent forward to the
field, preparations are being made for the
mobilization here of the New Mexico National
Guard and supply motor truck
trains, carrying ammunition, supplies and
equipment, are being sent to the front.
| .Last night a heavier guard than is cuaJ
tomary was thrown about the military
j reservation, gasoline supply uinns anci
store depots being guarded closely. With
no aeroplanes in the field tests of new
planes are being hurried by army aviators.
"Casuals'' Sent Back to Duty.
The first companies of the National
Guardsmen are expected to arrive in
Columbus late in the week. Maj. W. B.
Sample, base commander, detailed several
regular army officers to muster the
troops into the United States service
immediately upon their arrival. This
was said, however, to be merely a precautionary
measure in the event it
should become necessary to send tho
men over the state line.
About one' hundred "casuals" or soldiers
who have become detached from
their commands were ordered today to
join their organizations. One hundred
and fifty men of the 6th Cavalry, who
arrived recently to obtain remounts,
were sent back to the field by motor
truck, the animals being left here.
Unofficial reports from the field indicated
tension among the detachments
I along the line of communication similar
to that which seemed manifest
here. At military headquarters, however,
it was stated that there had been
ino large new movements of troops in
the expeditionary command.
I Gen. Pershing and his staff at San
| Antonio, Chihuahua, continued to keep
[in touch with the Mexican situation.
A number of messages and all availaIble
news are being transmitted to him
| by wireless.
