PRACTICAL WORK
PROVES
OPEN Tins EVENING.
Owing lo tbe fart that many people
were unable to rHt the school during
the day Principal Gninbcc annoum"!
this afternoon that the high school
will ho kept open from 7:30 until II
thla evening and that all tlie evIiiWr
and demonstrations of the various de
partments will be open to visitors. All
are Invited to attend, then- being no
charges Imposed.
For those not closely familiar with
Pendleton high school work there
have been genuine revelations today
In the form of the exhlbiis and dem
onstrations at the school. Instead of
having the exhibit down town as was
done during the past few years the
high school has been made use of so
as to depict the work more fully.
In the manual training department
there Is well built furniture of the
highest grade that will defy the clos
est Inspection. In addition to the
woodwork which has always been ex
ceedingly creditable to the school and
to Mr. t'hloupek, head of the depart
ment, forge work Is to be seen this
year and there are many products of
the forge work testifying to the skill
of the students In that line of effort.
A fact many people are unaware ol
Is that the manual training course

also includes much besides woodwork
and forging. The industrial arts ex
hibit shows excellent work in clay,
bookbinding, envelope making, weav
ing, etc. It is the belief of Mr. Chlou
pek that this work would be much
more efficient If the schools had an
art teacher who could cooperate In
this line of work.
The domestic science department
under Miss Alice Butler and Miss
Mildred Wilson, assistant, has been a
ery popular place today. This de
partment Is able to and does train
girl student In cook'ng, sewing and
general domestic economy. Kitchen
work is taught Upon u distinctly prac
tical yet scientific basis and the tame
is true of sewing, (lirls. whether
from fumilles of the rich, poor or
moderate circumstances financially
learn dressmaking, millinery and
needle work of all grades. The girls
ure allowed to make such garments
us the; desire for their own use and
hence the department will give in
atr UOtlon that fills a very practical
need In many cases.
In the agricultural department Mr.
(ianibee today has been carrying on
milk tests using the Bnbcock test
which determines the percentage of
butter fat In milk and constitutes the
basis on which cream Is sold to
INTO MSXICQ,
! creameries. The tests have been very
, interesting to visitor?.
I There is a pure food exhibit in the
! chemistry room thu" pauses astonish
ment to many. By novel means visi
ters are shown the injurious coloring
material used in some sorts of cann
ed goods.
The high school work has been con
ducted as usual today but a number
of students have been detailed to as
sist in showing visitors through the
: institution. Many took occasion to
; visit the school during the forenoon
'and this afternoon the attendance Is
even larger. A light luncheon Is be
ing served in the domestic science
room this afternoon, the proceeds be
ing used for the benefit of the track
team.

BERLIN, May 10. The Lokal An

reply will be acceptable. It said: '"If
he emphatically declares he will not
acknowledge the conditions attached
to a change in our submarining
methods, he knowingly is kicking

Protest Will Not
be Made in Case
ot liner Cymric
AMERICA, HOWEVER, WILL CON
SIDER UNWARNED ATTACKS
AS ILLEGAL.
WASHINGTON, May 10. It was
strongly indicated today that America
will not take action In the Cymric
case. Lansing's policy heretofore has
been not to protest in cases where
Americans were not jeopardized. It
was stated on high authority that
there was no change in the situation
et u was explained however, that
the administration will continue to
consider unwarned submarine at
tacks as Illegal, according to the gov
ernment's interpretation of the law.
Such attacks will be considered in
the cumulative evidence on the Ger
man attitude toward its submarine
acthrtty.
Germany Will Admit Guilt in

WASHINGTON. May 10. Gerard

was en route to Washington
Officials could not forecast the
probable punishment of the subma
rine commander. It was pointed out
that the maintenance of discipline In
the German navy was Important to
neutrals. Indemnities will await the
American claims. If the coming mes
sage does not give assurances of a

Obregon to Withdraw IBs) Tlaae
Limtt Demands; Washington la Not
Inclined to Temporise.
WASHINGTON. May 10 - The ad
ministration will not cake any chance
with Carranza. This is the Inner sig
nificance of the move in rushing' mi
litia and additional Infantry to tbe
border Although officials assume that
Carranza is acting in good faitb they
admit that his attitude is surprising
in view of his making a demand for
a time limit after Wilson had inform
ally approved the Sc0tt-Obregon
agreement several days ago.
It is believed that Carranza 'a tactics
have made the situation more grave
The administration had supposed that
the agreement was practically effec
tive. Reinforcing the border troops la ex
pected to prevent further raids and
to persuade Obregon to abandon the
time limit demands and stop plotting
on the American side of the line. Of
ficials discounted the possibility of
this move inflaming the Mexicans.
The administration believes that the
reinforcements will tend to prevent
intervention. It was evident that the
administration had reached a point
where it is not inclined to temporise
much further, but la still optimistic
regarding the future.
EL PASO, May It. Scott sent to
Washington today the suggestion ot
Obregon that Americans and Mex
icans cooperate In patrolling the bor
der, each remaining on their own aMie
of the line. Scott and Funstoa

Ing of the conference
Scott held the wnlp hand la the
Mexican situation today. For the
first time the American troop are
numerically superior to tbe Mexicans.
Scott remains obdurate against fixing
a time limit to the expedition.
MEXICO CITT. May 10. Strong
optimism toward a satisfactory out
come of the Seott-ODregon confer
ences was manifest today despite the
indications of friction. It Is under
stood that a final agreement will pro
vide for the withdrawal of the Am
erican troops and a Joint patrol of the
International boundary. Carranza
will insist that Mexican troops receive
the reciprocal privilege of crossing the
border in pursuit of bandits raiding
Mexico from the American side.
