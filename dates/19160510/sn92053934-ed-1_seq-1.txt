DIFFERENCES SECRET
Officials Fail to Disclose
Points That Are Halt-
ing Settlement
Washinsrton. May 10. Secretary
Fakir informed President Wilson
today that the conference between
t.encral Scott and General Obre
gon last night was not conclusive
and that it would be continued to
day. He indicated that the outlook
was more favorable for an agree
ment heine reached. The exact
points of difference were not re
vealed. General Scott has advised Secretary
Baker that no formal counter pro
posals have been submitted by Gen
eral Obregon. but that Obregon ar
ranged to submit a paper containing
his views today. General Scott did
not advise the department what coun
ter proposals were under considera
tion. Secretary Baker today received an
offer from Governor Finkham of Ha
waii, tendering the services of the Ha
waiian national guard.
With on t Answer.
El Taso, Texas, May 10. No answer
had been received early today from
Washington to General Scott's mes
sage reporting General Obregon's
proposal for a joint patrol of tbe in
ternational boundary. General Scott
said today's conference was to be held
regardless of whether a reply was re
ceived to the plan of the Mexican min
ister of war.
General Funston said he had no idea
when he would get back to his head
quarters at San Antonio. This was
taken to indicate that today's confer
ence may not be the last.
Obregon Optimistic.
From Juarez came reports that.
General Obregon and his advisors
were optimistic regarding the outcome
of the conference.
It was not expected that A. J. Mc
Quatters, the minir.g man who with
drew from last night's meeting, will
take no further part in the discus
sions. General Funston said tbe coast
guard ordered to the border would be
assigned to towns, which it could best
protect. The militia will be divided
among towns, bridges and easily ac
cessible points with close communi
cation, relieving the cavalry now doing
patrol duty, for service in the isolated
sections of the border.
Washington, May 10. VrrtnaTry the
last regular troops in the United
States were being mobilized today for
Mexican border service. With tbe na
tional guard of three states, they were
under orders to hasten to reinforce
General Funston's army. The total of
between nine and ten thousand includ
ed 11 companies of coast artillery or
dered out last night by Secretary
Baker.
The proposed military agreement
between the Carranza and American
government remained unsigned and
General Obregon, Mexican war minis
ter, after a three-hour discussion witli
General Scott last night arranged for
still another conference today.
If the situation warrants, national
guards of other states will be called
out for border patrol duty, officials de
clared. Secretary Baker stated, how
ever, that no further mobilization or
ders are contemplated immediately.
Threaten Big Revolt.
rnnffirial reports have been received
that Mexicans along the entire border
had planned for today a concerted up
rising. From Mazatlan, on the west
coast of Mexico came word that the
consul there had been warned by
anonymous letters that the consulate

THE WAR TODAY
There appears to be a deadlock
tn the fighting between the Or
mans and French, northwest of
'erdnn, neither side being able
to make much train. In other di
rection from Verdun fighting is
still going on. but it is somewhat
less violent than, for a few days
past.
On the Rirssfem front tbe Ger
mans continue to shell Ikskull
bridgehead and there is artillery
activity at other points.
In Armenia tlie Russians have
driven the Turks from their de
fenses in flie reirion of Mush and
have also dislodged them from
fortified positions near Bagdad.
Berlin advices say the Turks
are building a railroad through
the desert, preparatory to mating
another advance on Lgypt.
The Italians and Austrian are
still engaired in violent artillery
batik's in the region of San Mar
tino, and Vienna claims the Ital
ians suffered heavy losses by the
explosion of an Austrmn mine.
Parts advices from Salonikl say
that there has beon vigorons ar
tillery activity on the Macedonian
front. The Germans and Bulgar
ians have bombarded the village
of Mayada, causing much damage.
Secretary of War Raker last
night ordered 11 coast artillery
companies to the Mexican border,
in addition to the militia of Texas,
Kew Mexico and Arizona and three
regiments of I'nitcd States infan
try. A new note on the Sussex rase

Paris, May 10, (2:30 p. m.) Activity

German War Report.
Berlin, May 10, (by wireless to Say
ville). The Germans have made fur
ther progress on Hill 304 on the Ver
dun front and have driven back French
detachments southwest of the hill, the
war office statement of today.tsays. The
text follows:
"In the Argtrane the enemy, after a
mining operation, attempted to enter
our lines but was repulsed.
"Sot. th west of Hill 304 advanced de
tachments of the enemy were driven
further back. One detachment was
captured. The new German positions
on Hill 304 were extended.
"F-astern front A Russian attack
south of Garbunovkaalong a small
front was repulsed. The enemy suf
fered heavy losses."
Heavy Guns Win Gains.
Berlin, May 10. "The German at
tack on Verdun is based on the crush
ing elTort of German heavy artillery,"
writes Major Moraht, military critic
of the TageblatL "The capture of the
smaller fortresses in the west at the
beginning of the war by the use of
heavy artillery was only a prelude to
the artillery operations now in prog
ress. "The French have not been able to
compete with German artillery and
ammunition. The enormous losses of
the French are due partly to the effect
of the German artillery and partly to
the tenacity of the French, who will
not abandon their trenches.
Germans Outnumbered.
"Although it is generally consid
ered that attacking forces must be
four times superior to those of the
defense, in the Verdun campaign the
number of German troops engaged is
much less than half that of the French.
The number of French troops may be
calculated at not less than 800,000.
This figure represents half of the en
tire forces which France still has at
her disposal for active fighting.
"All tbe German successes on the
eastern and western fronts were
gained with numerically inferior for
ces. Moreover the Austro-Hungarian
troops for a year have been holding
back twice their number of enemy. The
principal elements in victory quality
of troops and courage are steadily
working to our advantage."

JAPAN CENTERS
EYE UPON CHINA
Situation Grows .More Intense With
Refusal of Salt Revenue Surplus
and Exodus of Chinese,
Tokio, April 13 (Correspondence of
The Associated Press.) The Chinese
question is increasingly the topicof
the day in Japan. Visitors returning
fr9lSjdBiPrt that interest there
is centered as much in what Japan
will do as in what the revolutionists
are accomplishing in the south. The
refusal of Japan to hand over the salt
revenue surplus to the government of
Yuan Shi Kai and the exodus of fright
ened Chinamen from Peking are con
sidered here as evidences of the grow
ing tenseness and danger of the Chi
nese situation.
With Japanese officials constantly
voicing their policy of non-interference
in Chinese domestic affairs, the
opinion is heard among representative
Japanese and among well informed
foreigners and even diplomats, that
the movement against Yuan Shi Kai
has gone so far that there is even a
probability that he will be unable to
hold his office as president
The political groups, hostile to the
present Japanese government, are in
active. Takashi Hara, leader of the
Seiyukai party, has recently severely
criticized the government's Chinese
policy, believing it responsible for the
present estrangement, between the
people of Japan and China. He urged
the importance of cultivating rela
tions of utmost cordiality and mutual
confidence between the two nations
and declared that the only way out of
the present problem of Japan's rela
tions with China was for Premier
Count Okunia and his fellow minis
ters to get out of office.
Insistent reports in the Japanese
press that Russia would soon conclude
an agreement wiih Japan, recognizing
Japan's special position in China have
created the impression that the en
tente allies, in consideration of
Japan's aid in the present war, may be
disposed to cede some of their own in
terests in China without in any way
encroaching upon the integrity of that
country, or make concessions on long
pending questions, general in nature,
touching upon the relations of the
powers generally in the far east.
The peace policy of the entente
powers is believed here to be very far
reaching and it is thought that at the
conclusion of the present war an effort
will be made to eliminate China and
the far east generally as a seat of pos
sible future trouble.
An indication that the China situa
tion may be approaching a climax is
found in the words of Tan Jen-Feng, a
revolutionary leader who has been
staying in Tokio several months and
has Just left for the revolutionary cen
ter of Kwang-Tung.
"My visit to Tokio was to consult
Sun Yat Sen, Chan Chung-Huen and
other revolutionary leaders on an im
portant question," he is quoted as say
ing. "I am going shortly, to a certain
designation to make a formal declara
tion about the attitude of the revolu
tionists toward the existing situation.
The formation of a new government to
control the provinces which have de
clared their independence will be real
ized sooner or later. The candidate for
the head of the new government Is not
yet selected."

WHEN PEACE COMES
FAMOUS WRITER
PLEADS FOR IRISH
George Bernard Shaw Itecries Execu
tions of Rebels of Ireland Up
rising by the British.
London, May 10. George Bernard
Shaw, discussing the executions of the
Sinn Feiners, in an open letter today,
says: , .'
"My view Is, that the men who were
shot in cold blood after their capture
or surrender were prisoners of war,
and it was therefore entirely incorrect
to slaughter them. The relation of
Ireland to Dublin castle is in this re
spect precisely the same as the Bal
kan states toward Turkey, or Belgium
toward the kaiser, or of the United
States to Great Eritain. Until Dublin
castle is superseded by a national
parliament and Ireland is voluntarily
incorporated with the British empire
like Canada, Australia or South Af
rica, an Irishman resorting to arms
to achieve the independence of his
country is doing only what English
men will do if invaded and conquered
by the Germans. Such an Irishman
is as much in order morally in ac
cepting assistance from the Germans
as England is in accepting the as
sistance of Russia in a struggle with
Germany.
"The fact that he knows that his
enemies will not respect his rights if
they catch him, and that he must fight
with a rope around his neck, adds in
some measure to his glory in the
eyes of his compatriots and in the
eyes of disinterested admirers of pa
triotism throughout the world. The
slaughter of a man in this position
makes him a martyr and a hero. The
shot Irishmen will now take their
places beside Emmet and the Man
chester martyrs in Ireland and beside
the heroes of Poland, Serbia and Bel
gium in Europe. Nothing in heaven
or earth can prevent it.
"I am not a Sinn Feiner. I have al
ways insisted it is the duty of Ireland
to throw herself with all her force
against the Germans and Austrians.
But I remain an Irishman arfd will
fight for Irish independence against
British government."
THAT GOLD TOOTH IS
NO LONGER STYLISH
Springfield, 111., May 10. A display
of jrold in the human mouth, thought
very attractive 20 years ago, is abso
lutely prohibited today by the ethical
dentist, says Dr. J. W. Conzett of Du
buque, Iowa, who will speak on "The
Present Trend Operative Dentistry"
before the annual meeting of the Illi
nois State Dental society, which is in
convention here. "The dentistry of
the past had a narrow perspective,
simply the saving of the individual
tooth," says Dr. Conzett. "Today we
have a larger outlok and see in the
preservation of the tooth not only the
saving of it but the restoration of its
function."
The convention will not adjourn
until Friday. Clinics will be held to
day and Friday.

Carrington, N. D., May 10. When
Anfield Shiflet, 24 years old, commit-,
ted suicide yesterday when cornered,
by a sheriff's posse seeking his arrest,
for the murder of his father, Joseph
Shiflet, two weeks ago, he ended a ca
reer of crime in which he killed his
father, mother and a brother, accord
ing to statements of the Foster county
officials.
Two weeks ago the body of Joseph
Shiflet was found in a burning straw
stack.
Two years ago, Mrs. JoseDh Shiflet
was found dead at the foot of the base
ment stairs in her home, killed by a
gunshot wound. Anfield Shiflet was
the only person on the farm at the
time. Following invesBications. the
coroner's jury returned a verdict of
suicide.
Nine years ago a brother of Anfield
Shiflet disappeared. When last seen
he was with Shiflet.
Circumstances surrounding the
death of Joseph Shiflet led the au
thorities to believe that Antiold was
responsible for his death. When the
sheriff went to arrest the man, he fled
and was later surrounded in a corn
field where he killed himself.
