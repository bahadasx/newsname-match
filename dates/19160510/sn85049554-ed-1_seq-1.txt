INSISTING ON WITHORAWAL.
bregen "Vant* Question of 8tay of
tops 8ettied First.
B1 Paso, Tex., May 10.—Increasing
onfldence in the ability of Generals
cott and Obregon to effect an agreem
ent as to the status of the American
iltlve expedition In Mexico was ert
on both sides of the Rio Grande,
iday, notwithstanding the situation
not" materially altered by the
nferees last night. The optimism ap
peared based- largely on the admis
sion that another conference would be
held, perhaps today, and that'General
Obregon and his military adviiers
maintained an attitude of hopefulness.
The hot result of the conferences al
ready held is that the Mexican re pie
sentatives insist upon placing the
question of the withdrawal of General
Pershing's 'forces ahead of the ques
tion of co-operation.'
General Scott was expected Jo re
ceive from the war department a com
munication on which a reply could be
proposed to General Obregon. With
this General Obregon believed that co
operation in the running down of ban
dits that raided across the line might
bfi^ effected,
Whether the "conference will take
1/lace before late today was unknown
either at General. Obregon's headquar
ters or at General Scott's. Because -of
the new* phases suggested by General
Obregon* It was believed probable that
he.woqld consult with Carranza and
..thai delays- in communicating with
the. Mclean capital might make the
holding :of the' conference before to
morrow Impossible.
Troop Moverrent Not Disturbing.
The ordering into, the border coun
try of more regular troops and militia
appeared not to Worry General Obre
gon, and military men with him, iior
did Juan N. Armador, sub-secretary
,of foreign affairs, appear perturbed.
They Msiimed that the Increasing of

general jT^nston said he hid no Mea
quarters at San Antonio. This was
taken to indicate th»t today's confer
ence may not be the last.
Prom Juares came reports that
General Obregon and his advisers
were optimistic regarding the outcome
of the conference. It is not expected'
that A. J. McQuatter, the mining man
who .Withdrew from last night's meet
ing, will take further part In the dis
cussions.
/General Scott explained today that
in view of the attitude of General
Obregon he had not thought it proper
to insist on, Mr. McQuatter's attend
ance, especially as the latter had no
official standing.
To Divide Militia.
General Funston said the coast
guard ordered to the border would be
assigned to towns which it could best
protect. The militia will be divided
among towns, easily accessible points
with close communication, relieving
the. cavalry now doing patrol duty for
service In the isolated sections of the
border. Two troops of the Twenty
first infantry left El Paao today to
guard the big bridge near Del Rio on
tjie Southern Paciflc line.
General Pershing has been ordered
to begin a greater concentration of his
troops. Those detachments operating
as far south as San Antonio will be
withdrawn to Colonia Dublan.
American military men^today said
they could not accfept the fact that a

Said to Have Been Gained by Numer
ioally Inferior Force*—British De
stroyer Damaged Off Belgian Coast
Berlin, wireless to SayVille^ May 10.
'The German attack on Verdun is
based on the crushing effect of German
heavy artillery," writes Major iMoraht,
military critic of the Tageblatt. "The
capture of the smaller fortresses in the
west at the beginning of the war by
the use of heavy artillery was only a
prelude to the artillery operations now
in progress.
.' The French have not been able to
compete with German artillery and
ammunition. The enormous losses of
the French are partly due to the Ger
man artillery and partly due to the
tenacity of the French, who will not
abandon their trenches.
"While it is generally considered
that attacking forces must be four
times superior to the defending troops
at Verdun, it .is true that the German
force is not half that of the French.
The French force is estimated at 800,
000. This represents half the entire
force France still has for active fight
ing.
"All the German successes on the
eastern and western fronts were
gained with numerically inferior
forces. Moreover,- the Austro-Hun
garlan forces for more than a year
have been holding back twice their
number. The principal elements in
victory—quality of troops and courage
—-are steadily working to our advan
tage."

written three additional contingents
of Russian troops have landed at Mar
seilles. On the basis of the size of the
first two contingents, something like
25,000 Russians are now in camp or
in the field on the western front.)
The voyage of the Russians con
stitutes a record in military transport
history for distance and diversity of
route. The soldiers were concentrated
in Moscow under the supervision of
General Lochwltsky, and entrained for
carriage by the Trans-Siberian rail
road. across nearly 7.500 miles of coun
try to Dalny, near Port Arthur,
whence they were to start, on a sea
voyage of about 10,000 miles.
Arriving at Port Dalny the. Russians
voyaged along the coasts of half the
eastern world, the route being from
Dalny along the Korean shore, then
thru the Yellow and Chinese seaa fcnd
then, reaching Singapore, whjre the
"transports. entered the Indian" Qcean
by the Straite- of Malacca. The troops
then made thpir'way by Aden and the
Red sea to the Suez -Canal and Port
Said, thence to Marseilles thru tfce
Mediterranean.
The arrival of the Russians was a
great surprise to the general public in
France. On the other hand, the send
ing of the contingent in all prob
ability was perfectly well known to
the German authorities.
Indeed it is practically certain,
since, as the Russian general com
manding the contingent told the As
sociated Press correspondent, two at
tempts were made by the Germans to
attack the transports while on their
way by sea from Port Dalny to Mar
seilles.
