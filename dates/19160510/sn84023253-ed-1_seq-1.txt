The French and German forces ap
parently are deadlocked on the front
in the Verdun section. The Ger
mans seemingly are unable to ad
vance and the French are unable to
expel them from the positions they
hold. To the east and northeast of
Verdun there are respectively artil
lery battles and bombardments. An
intermittent cannonading is going on.
The only infantry engagement report
ed today was launched by the Ger
mans against the French trenches
around the foot of Hill 304. The
French brought into play their cur
tain of fire and the Germans were
unable to debauch.
The shelling of the German posi
tions at Ikskull by the Russians on
the eastern battle line is still in prog
ress. The artillery activity on the
other sectors of the Russian front are
not important. The Rusians in Ar
menia have put down the Turkish at
tack to the southeast in the region of
Mush and driven their entire line
from the mountain chain. In addi
tion Russia is operating westward
from the Persian fort at Bagdad and
have dislodged the Turks from five
positions and driven them to Gorizia
bridge head around San Martino.
On the Austrian-Italian front there
are heavy bombardments. At San
Martino the tlalians suffered heavy
losses from the exploison of mines.
There is also bombarding on other
sectors.
A dispatch to Paris from Salonlkl
says that vigorous artillery battle is
going on on the Macedonian front.
An Athens dispatch says the German
Bulgarian forces are bombarding
Nayada, their shells causing much
damage.
Semi-omical advices from Berlin
state that the Turks are constructing
a railroad across the desert prepara
tory to an advance on Egypt.. Five
battalions of sick and wounded Brit
ish soldiers from Kut-El-Mara cen
Blsting of 1,073 men have reached
Bridgehead.

Lightning Wrecks House.
During the first electrical storm of
the season about 4 o'clock Sunday
afternoon lightning played queer
pranks and did hundreds of dollars
damage at the home of G. L. Colburn
in Mount Holly, two bolts striking
the house. Mrs. Colburn and her
guest, Mrs. A. W. Cook, also Allen
Burton, who were in the house, es
caped injury though all weer severe
ly stunned. The first bolt entered the
top of the chimney and made its ap
pearance in a chamber by leaving
the stovepipe at a tee. From "the
chamber the bolt passed downward
to the living room where it demol
ished a gasoline lamp which stood on
a table, tore rugs and carpets into
shreds and splintered the floor, leav
ing the room by way of the telephone
wires which were broken by the cur
rent. The second, and most severe
bolt struck a tree west of the Colburn
home and jumped to the house, com
pletely tearing away the northwest
corner of the building. The bolt fol
lowed a cross sill in the cellar for
about 10 feet when it divided and
tore up carpets and floors in two bed
rooms on the first floor.
Mileage Nuisance Abolished.
(Special to the Caledonian.)
Montpelier, May 9. A circular is
sued by the Central Vermont railroad
today announces that Montpelier and
Wells River, St. Johnsbury and Lake
Champlain and Boston and Maine
mileages will be accepted in payment
f fare on the Central Vermont line
between White River Junction and
Windsor and between Brattleboro and
East Northfleld, Mass. Central Ver
mont mileages will be accepted on
the Boston and Maine sections of the
road between White River Junction
and Greenfield, Mass. This does
away with a great inconvenience to
through passengers who have had to
pay fare or buy two mileages to get
over this strip of road.
Nasol is not a secret.
BERLIN SHORT OF MEAT

London, May 9. A Copenhagen dis

evered that Berlin has but a few days'

lem there is very serious.
GERMAN" PLOTTERS GUILTY.
Jury Asked Clemency for an Employe
of Robert Fay.
New York, May 9. The Jury which
for 10 days heard testimony at the
trial of Robert Fay, a former lieu
tenant in the German army, Walter
Scholz and Paul Daeche, ' charged
with conspiracy to destroy munitions
shops through bomb contrivances.
returned a .verdict of guilty last
night against all of the defendants.
The Jury deliberated on the case for
five hours and in reaching a verdict
asked for clemency in behalf of
Daeche who, according to his own
statements and those of Fay and
Scholz, was an employe of Fay and
knew little of the details of the "fire
bomb" plots.
The defendants each are liable to
a maximum sentence of 12 years im
prisonment and the payment of a
$10,000 fine. Judge Howe announced
he would impose sentence this morn
ing. The defendants were found
guilty on two indictments.
Fay heard the verdict unmoved;
Scholz straightened up in his chair,
while tears welled in the eyes of
Daeche. Fay and Scholz were re
turned to the Tombs, but Daeche was
released under $25,000 bail.
Fay declared his lawyers would ap
peal from the verdict. It was learned
that Fay was found guilty on one
ballot, Scholz, on two ballots, while
there were eight ballots before an
agreement on Daeche was reached.
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS
Commissioner of Education Stone Ex
plained Their Purpose to St.
Johnsbury People.
State Commissioner of Education
M. S. Stone was in town last evening
and addressed the people at the town
hall on the plan and provisions of the
junior high schools provided for un
der the new educational law.
He said that under the present law
the elementary course in the public
schools provides a six years' course
for boys and girls between six and 12
years of age, and covers the last
years of childhood. The Junior high
school course is for four years, de
signed for children from 12 to 16
year sof age, and covers the youth
period. The youth period Is entirely
different from the childhood period
and the content of instruction as well
as methods of Instruction are entirely
different. In the youth period the
boy grows faster physically than men
tally and should have some vocation
al subject, or physical expenditure.
The state of Vermont aids the Jun
ior high school, but will not aid the
ordinary high school, tl does this be
cause the junior high school is an
agency for the development of Ver
mont, while the ordinary high school
is an agency for the depletion of
Vermont. Vermont must build up by
building up its young men and wom
en to see the opportunities and do the
necessary work.
The subjects taught in the Junior
high school function not only in the
lives of the boys and girls but In
the life of industry and the com
munity. The ordinary high school
does not function in either the com
munity or the lives of the students to
any large degree. The ordinary high
school fits for college but only five
per cent, of the children go to college.
The junior high school fits the 95
per cent who do not go to college to
be prepared for life.
The colleges are adjusting their
curriclum to the new system so that
any boy who has compelted the sen
ior junior high school period will be
able to find a place in the college.
St. Johnsbury must settle its own
problems and consider carefully
whether it wants to make an invest
ment or pay a tax.
At the close of the address a large
number of questions were asked by
different members of the audience
which showed their Interest In the
subject.
ADVANCE PRICE OF COAL.
Federal Board of Trade May Make an
Investigation.
New York, May 9. Circulars an
nouncing an advanec in the price of
hard coal was approved by the
wholesale dealers in anthracite coal
today. It is planned to send the cir
culars to the retail delars tomorrow.
The operators would not comment on
the announcement of the federal
board of trade that if the prices of
coal were advanced it would make an
Investigation.
Stowe Physician Injured.
Dr. J. C. Morgan, a prominent
physician of Stowe village, was se
riously injured Monday afternoon
when thrown from his carriage. He
was driving on Maple street when the
horse shied suddenly at an automo
bile, the carriage striking a hydrant.
Dr. Morgan was dragged over the
dashboard and thrown to the ground
with such violence that one hip was
badly fractured. He was taken to the
Fanny Allen hospital.
Present to Their Pastor.
The last session of the class for
Bible study that has met weekly at
the Baptist parsonage for the last
four months, was held Monday even
ing. The class presented the pastor.
Rev. F. S. Tolman, with a gold
watch and chain and a purse of mon
ey, as an expression of the apprecia
tion for the help received in the
study of the Gospel of Mark. The
presentation was made by Mr. Mar
shall of the City Mission and Mr.
Tolman made a fitting response.
Congregational Preachers.
The Caledonia Union of Congrega
tional ministers met at the South
church Tuesday with a good attend
ance. The morning speaker was Rev.
E. F. French of Hardwlck, whose
subject was "Exposition of Ephesians."
In the afternoon Rev. A. H. Rose of
East Burke spoke on "The Three
Prophets of Exile Jeremiah, Isaiah
and Ezeklel." Both talks were fol
lowed by discussion in which many
of tbe ministers joined.
The 25 cent piece was made famous
by the American Liver Tablets, the
perfect laxative.
MAY CALL XATIOXAL ilTAUI.
More Soldiers Wunlcd Along the
Mexican Frontier.
Washington, May 9. Recommend
ations from Major-Gen. Kunston
looking to a redispoaltion of forces
for the better protection of the Amer
ican border from badit raids are un
derstood to have been discussed at a
conference at the White House last
evening between President Wilson
and Secretary Baker.
Both the White House officials and
the secretary declined to disclose the
purpose of the interview. Mr. Baker
also refused to say whether Gen.
Funston has recommended the utiliza
tion of all or part of the National
Guard as a border patrol. It is un
derstood, however, that such a sug
gestion has been made.
With the exception of 4,000 to 5,000
members of cavalry, field artillery and
Infantry all the regular mobilized
army of 48,000 men, including 5,000
recruits enlisted under the Hay reso
lution are now on the border or In
Mexico. The force actually on the
border numbers approximately 22,000
and with this force, army officers de
clare, it Is impossible effectually to
protect the border.
Gov. Ferguson of Texas Is report
ed here to have summoned the Na
tional Guard of that state to the col
ors and to have sent several com
panies of state militia Into the Big
Bend country to co-operate with the
regular army.
Members of the Texas delegation In
Congress are receiving telegrams urg
ing that some action be taken and
sentiment In favor of calling out the
National Guard is said to be growing
generally among members of Con
gress from the border states.
Secretary Lansing, while admitting
that Carranza In his note demanding
a withdrawal of the American forces
had repudiated this government's un
derstanding that he had agreed to
the pursuit of the Columbus raiders,
insisted that so much of the original
agreement as referred to raids that
migh follow that at Columbus was
still In effect. Thus, he Indicate, the
United States would be acting entire
ly within its rights If a new expedi
tion were sent on a "hot trail" after
the Glen Spring3 and Boquillas raid
ers. Formal representations informing
Carranza of the attacks oa the two
Texas towns, but demanding nothing
particularly In the way of redress,
were sent to Special Agent James
Lynn Rodgers in Mexico City last
night, Secretary Lansing says.
Secretary Baker has received no
information that any troops have been
sent across the line to pursue the
raiders. He said last evening:
"The situation is wholly In Gen.
Funston's hands. His orders are to
protect the border. All the troops in
Mexico and on the border are under
Gen. Funston's Immediate command,
and he can do with them as he sees
fit."
"Goodness, Man! I Never Saw
You Looking So Well
Been Away?"
"No, sirree! I've just ordered my
summer Coal and told the dealer to
put it in as soon as be can, at the
best price possible I feel like a
new man."
Moral: Go thou and do likewise.
