WILL TAKE NO CHANCES
IN DEAL WITH CARRANZA
Courtesy CompeV Apparent Belief la His Good Faith But
Those Dealii p With Him Prepare to Check Any Move
On His Part- forcing Border Troops Sets Obregon
Thinking and I sed Him to Hurriedly Seek Another
Conference it, ico Mast Yield, or Fight
By Carl D. Groat
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Washington, May 10. The administration will take no
chances on Carranza. This is the inner significance of
the move in rushing militia and additional inf antrv to the
border. Supplementary orders last night dispatched
eleven coast artillery companies and five field artillery
batteries to San Antonia, Texas.
While officials assume that Carranza is acting in good
faith they admit that his attitude is surprising in view
of his making a demand for a time limit on the presence
. of American soldiers in Mexico after President Wilson
had informally approved the agreement which Generals
Scott and Obregon reached several days ago." Officials
say that the situation has been made more grave by Car
ranza's tactics. The administration supposed the agree
ment to be practically in effect, but Carranza has not yet
approved it, so far as has been officially reported.
Reinforceing of the border troops is expected to pre
vent further raids, persuade General Obregon to abandon
his time limit demands and put a stop to plotting on the
'American side of the line. Officials discounted the possi
bility of this move inflaming the Mexicans.
The administration believes that this reinforcement
will tend to prevent intervention. It is evident also that
. .the administration has reached a point where it is not in
clined to temporarize much further, but still optimistic
regarding the future. It does not regard the Scott
Obregon conference situation as hopeless. ,

289. (By courier to Columbus, N. M.)
Manuel Baca, famed Villista colonel,
is de.vd again. His demise "took"
this time, however. He may be rated
as permanent IJv, no-doubt-about-itly
dead. American officers of Colonel
Dodd's command officially pronounced
him so and the old story a woman
was told in connection with his end.
Baca rode into Santo Tomas on
April 23, a fugitive seeking a hiding
plice, after Dodd's men had cut his
command to shreds in tho fight at To
maehie. His big white horse was
wounded in the neck, a reminder of
the engagement.
Manuel Baca must take a woman in
to hiding with him and he made a mis
take in picking tho woman.
The pretty daughter of Tenndo Alvt
rez caught his eye and the Vilista lead
er slipped from his horse and advonced
to where she stood in the doorway of
her father's home.
He seized her aim; she screamed. Al
varez rushed to the door with a rifle,
firing twice ns he ran, and Baca fell
deid.
Alvarez received 20 pesos from the
government as an ndvuuce on the re
ward for Baca's death.

There was nothing in the overnight
news to modify the general uncertainty
of the situation and prices were irreg

maintained a waiting attitude showing
no disposition to buy or sell so the deal

Even professionals appeared at a loss
to determine a course of action. In
fact, the indications were that the
market had reached a dead center.
Cross movements and mixed changes
featured the day and tho tone was
heavy at times, particularly in railways
in the early afternoon. Vague and in

Not So Great As Armies

Berlin, by wireless via Sayville, Stay
10. "While it is generally considered
that attacks on fortified, positions must
be made w ith forces four times superior
to those of tho defenders, the Germans
assaulting Verdun are really less than
half as numerous as the French army,
which has at that point not less than
800,000 men," said a semi-official war
office statement toduy.
"This is half of tho entire force
which France still has at its disposal
for active fighting. The second Ger
man attack on Verdun is based on tho
crushing effect of heavy German artil
lery. The French are unable to com
pete with Germuny in artillery and
ammunition. The enormous French
losses are due partly to the effect of
the artillery and partly -to the tenacity
of tho French who refuse to abandon

Via New Orleans
Seattle, Wash., May 10. Chairman
Charles A. Keynohls, of the Washing
ton stnte public service commission, to
day charged by inference at the rate
hearing to eliminate a $17.50 differen
tial in tourist fines favoring the South
ern Pacific and allied lines as against
the northwest, that various railroads
are continuously aim openly violating
the Sherman nuti trust law.
The second day's session of the hear
ing was opened by Examiner Wilbur La
Rose, Jr., of tho interstate commerce
commission at 10 o'clock this morn
ing. Keynohls asked that the constitution
and by-laws of tho Transcontinental
Pnssenger association, which meets in
Chicago each yenr to agree upon rates
and fares for the various railroads with
in its membership bo admitted in evi
dence. They would show, he said he be
lieved, that the carriers' rates were
governed by the acts of that body.
'I find nothing in the by-laws to
indicate that," said La Itoe. "The by
luws sav 'each carrier Miall fix its own
fares.' S
"That provision," declared Rey
nolds, "is merely to eliminate tho
chance of prosecution for violating the
Sherman anti trust net. Tney know it.
We know it. Everybody knows it."
Attorney Durbow, of Sun Francisco,
counsel for the Southern Pucific, jump
ed to his feet and shouted:
"I move that those impertient re
marks about infractions of tho anti
trust law be stricken from the record
of this hearing."
"They will not be stricken," re
plied Examiner La Jtoc.
L. M. Lepper, of Portland, represent-
jig the Business Men's club of that city
anu a score or commercial organizations
of Oregon, testified the differential
rate acted us a means of diverting tour
ist travel from the northwest.
He, and other witnesses, including
Gordon C. Corbnley, secretary of the
Spokane chamber of commerce, und Dnl
Smith, ucting secretary of the Tacomn
Commercial cluli, and chamber of com
merce, gave evidence showing enormous
sums of money hud been spent in a vain
effort to get tourists to travel through
the northwest.
The gist of their testimony was that
tourist traffic remuined outside the
northwest because of the higher rate
travelers are forced to pay over north
ern routes on the round trip from Chi
cago to San Francisco.
F. E. Batters, general passenger agent
for the Southern Pnciric, testified that
the excess charge was made to provide
revenue for the lino between d'ortlund
and San Francisco.
Evidence indicating the enormity of
the volume of tourist traffic divert
ed at Chicago from the northwest by
reason of n $17.50 lower fare over the
Southern Pucific and its allied lines was
brought out on cross examination of
the railroad's witnesses during tho
morning session today,
W. J. Cannon, assistant general pas
senger agent of the Chicago, Milwaukee
4 St. Paul railway, of Chicago, testified
on direct examination that his office
last year booked only 50 pea cent of ap
plicant tourists over its own rails via
the northwest to Sun irancisco and re
turn. What you mean to say," said Chair
man Keynohls, of the Washington pub
lic, service commission, cross questioning
the witness, "is that 50 per cent of the
people who came tu the Milwaukee
ticket office at Chicago to buy tickets
to the Pacific const were diverted, bo
cause of a $17.."0 lower rate, to other
liues the southern routet"
"I answered the question," said Can
non. "Generally the person seeking your
office does so to buy a ticket over your
road, does he not!" Reynolds asked.
The witness admitted that such wus
the fact.
"Thou you testify," said Reynolds,
"that haff the people who came to the
Milwaukee office to buy tickets in 1015
didn't do so, but were routed over other
rondst"
'.'Yes," replied C;-non.
"The other 50 per cent chose the
southern and central ryutes?"
"Yes."
Tho history of the differential wns
shown by other witnesses for the mil

By Bobert X Bender.
(United Press stuff correspondent.)
Washington, May 10. Germany to
day made good on its first promise in
the kaiser's note accepting America's
submnrino position. Ambassador Gerard
cablod that the government had form- '
ally admitted tho torpedoing of tha
channel packet oussex by a Gc.rmun
submarine, but his communication td
the state department did not say wheth
er the Teuton messnge contained any
thing but acceptance of responsibility.
It was learned thnt if the present mes
sngo does not givo assurance of repara
tion for victims and ample punishment
for tho of funding subi-urine ccamnnd
er, another communication containing .
such assurances will hi sent to !?eie
tary Lansing.
Full disavowal for the Sussex attack,
ample reparation for the victims and
satisfactory punishment, to thp subma
rine commander will bo given, the Ger
man embassy stated vrncn it learned
that the Berlin government had admit
ted guilt. Tho pledge in the last Ger
man note mado it self evident that .
there would be no hesitating in dis
avowing such an act.
No official could forecast the punish
ment to be imposed upon the commuud
er. It was pointed out that mainten
ance of discipline in the German navy
for violation of instructions was im
portant. Tho matter of giving indemn
ity will await the filing of American
claims.
Tho note said that the submarine
commander had already been punished.
Tho nnture of the penalty was not mnda
public. '
In part the note suit
"The furthor investigation made ly
German navnl authorities on the bnsi
of Americnn material has boon conclud
ed. The assumption expressed in the
noto of the 10th ultimo that damage to
the Sussex was traceable to causes
other than attack by a German subma
rine cannot bo maintained."
"On the basis of American material
Gormany cannot withhold its convietio-
that tho ship torpedoed by a German
submarine is in fact identical with tho
Sussex hold described by them upon
"There can no longer bo any queat;ui
of the possibility of two independe.it
similar occurences. Additional reason
for this belief is constituted by tho
fnct that officers of tho American navy
found fragments of nn explosive in the
Susses hold described by them vpon
firm grounds ns parts of a German tor
pedo." "Counter evidence deducted in the
previous note from the difference: in th
appearance of the vessel which the sub
marine commander described and the
only reproduction of tho Sussex then
available has proven untenable. In view
of the general impression of all th
facts at hand the German govermrent
considers beyond a doubt thnt the com
mander acted in bona fide belief 'hat hs
