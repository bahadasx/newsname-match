State Pepartment officals are not im
pressed with the argument that thej
Cymrie was ehartered to the British i
Admiralty, and therefore a nav_l

I.ansing believes, is not affected hy its j

no right to clear from an American
port with a careo of munitions had II

REVOLT HASTENS
IRISH HOME RULE
Manifesto Expeeted To?
morrow?Draft for Ire?
land Project Defeated.
London. May 9. That Home Ru!e
for I'eland is deflnitcly in sight and
may be foreshadowed in a manifesto to
the Tribh people to be published this
week is almost certain to prove to be
the result ot yosterday'a eonferenca
between John Redmond, the Nation
alist leader, and Sir Kdward Carson,
. chief of thc Ulatarfta I'nionisti.
It is understood that the tcrtns of
: the manifesto ha-e been agreed upon,
but that its publication has been arith
i held until Thursday, r=o as to serure its
simultaneous appearance in all parts
of Ireland. Various rumors were rur
rcnt in the lobbies of Parliament to
night eoncrrning tiegotiations between
the (.overnment and the Irish partic*.
but nothing is likely to be decided
upon by the lattcr until after I'remier
Asquith's pronouncement on the Irish
situation, whtch la expeeted to-morrow.
Thus it looks as though Ireland's
unfortunate experience of the last few
weeks might become the indirect means
of adjusting in a manner satisfactory
to all parties the difticult Homc l.til*
probiem, whieh ??? hung up with the
outbrrak of the war.
Against Irish ( onerrlplion.
Speaking in the House of f ommons
to-day on a motion to Include Ireland
in the rompulsory service bill. John
Redmond besought. the House not only
for the sake of Ireland but for the sake
of the empire, to reject the proposal.
He opposed conscription for Ireland,
he said, ln the belief that compulsion
would be the worst possible way to get
men in Ireland. adding that after re?
cent events his deliberate opinion was
that it would be not only wrong. but
wellnigh insane to attempt to enforce
compulsory eervice. It would be a
fearful responsibility, he pofnted out,
if in the face of this deliberate opinion
I'lstermen should persist in the at?
tempt.
"Nobody is more anxious than I." he
continued. "to respond to the Ulatar
appeal for cooperation. I have hoped
