Mexican Bandits Again Raid
American Soil
Alpine, Texas., May 7.?Villa
bandits, some 70 in number,
forded the Rio Grande Friday
night and sweeping 15 miles in
land on American soil, raided
the little settlement of Glenn
Springs and attacked a detachment
of American cavalry consisting
of nine men of Troop A,
the Fourteenth Cavalry.
Three troopers and a little 10year-old
boy were kiled, two cavalrymen
were wounded and an
other is missing. He is believed
to be a prisoner of the bandits
who are now fleeing southward
into Coahuila, Mexico.
Two American citizens, J.
Deemer. and a man named
Compton, according to reports
received here, were carried
across the Rio Grande and repoits
have it that their throats
were cut. A posse of 50 citizens
of Marrthon tonight are in pursuit
of the Villistas.
El Paso, Texas, May 7.?Three
American soldiers and a 10-yearold
boy have lost their lives and
two American citizens have
been kidnapped and carried
south of the international line to
almost certain death in another
raid of Mexican bandits that
takes rank with Francisco Villa's
famous attack on Columbus, N.
M. whether the marauders were
Villa bandits or Carranza forces
is not known.
The bandits* foray, carrying
them through the Southern lim
its of Brewster County in the
Big Bend district of Texas, and
taking in three little settlements
near the border?Glenn Springs,
Boquillas and Deemers? took
place on Friday night and Saturday
morning, but news of it
did not reach here until today.
Within an hour preparations
had begun for adequate action.
Major General Funston ordered
four troops of cavalry to the
raided section to reinforce small
detachments already on their
way to the scene from Presidio,
Alpine and other points. These
troops got under way tonight.
It is said here that as the exigen
cies of the case demand such ac
tion they will cross the border in
order to run down and disperse
the bandits. The forces consist
of two troops of the Eighth Cavalry
from Fort Bliss, El Paso,
under Major Langhorne. and
two troops of the Fourteenth

morning, Major Langhorne's at
Alpine and Colonel Sibley's at
Marathon, From these points
they will march south 90 miles
to the border.
While military events were
developing with such rapidity,
the conference over the co-operation
of American and Mexican
soldiers in Mexico which had
been expected to reach a culmination
today, came to an abrupt
halt.

Whew! !
The Cheraw Chronicle tells
the following:
Mr. J. H. Lavina. who lives
over in Marlboro county, just
about six miles from Cheraw,
had a most unusual experience
last Friday. Mr. Lavina is a
paralytic and was sitting out on
the piazza at his home* when,
;? - *
wiuiuui wuiuiiiK a large wild
turkey* flew down right into
his lap. Mr. Lavina tnrew his
arms around the turkey and
held onto him until help arrived
when his tuikeyship was landed
in a coop, where, at last accounts,
he was getting on nicely.
A German had an explosion
in his shop, and was blown
tnrougn the door out into the
street. He was stunned, but not
hurt. Upon being congratulated
by a passer by on bis escape, he
answered:
"Ya, ya; I shust got oudt in
time."
Your Newspaper Costs More
A recent issue of the J Fourth
Estate, a publisher's periodical,
gives the following facts in regard
to the increased cost of the
newspaper:
The price of practically every
item employed in making newspapers
has gone up since the
European war started in August,
1914, the increases ranging from
one per cent in some cases to
3,000 in others. The making of
war munitions and clothing for
.1 I_ .L - . 1 1
iut; iul'u in uie irencnt's nas
taken so nuch material necessary
for printing out of the domestic
trade that uncertain and prohibitive
prices are now the rule.
Here are some examples:
One of the first eiements of
newspaper printing to feel the
pressure of war demands was the
metal supply. Lead is produced
chiefly in the United States, but
the foreign demand has been far
stronger than the domestic market,
and lead has jumped from
$4.25 per hundred-weight before
thf* war to f7 W now
The tin used in type metal is
to a great extent under English
control, and is exported only
with the permission of the British
Government. In 1914 block
tin was quoted in New York at
an average price of $40. Today
limited quantities of the same
tin bring $55 in hundred pound
lots.
Antimony, the hardening con
stituent of type metal, is also
used in shrapnel and in the as*
phyxialing gases used by the
belligerents. The most careful
ly smelted varieties of this metal
came from Europe before the
war, and were quoted at $8 to $9
per hundred weight. The present
supply is being imported from
the Far East, because the European
metal is unabtainable, and
is priced at about $44.
Gum arabic, used in making
sterotype matrices, has increased
100 per cent since 1914.
Wraoninor rwnpr QnH twino
used in the circulation work
have also doubled in price, due
to the increased difficulty in
shipping.
News ink has gradually moved
up ten to 25 per cent over
former prices, so that a quality
which sold for $80 18 months
ago now brings $100.
Raw material has also advanc
ed in even greater proportions.
Dry carbon black, which was
plentiful until a short time ago
at 4 1-2 to 5 cents per pound,
now is sold in the open marktt
for 25 cents.

Reminds Us of Some Folks We
Know
In a lawsuit in which Abraham
Lincoln represented one
party, the lawyer on the other
side was an extremely glib talker,
but not reckoned as deeply
profound or much ot a thinker.
He would say anything to a jury
which happened to enter his
head. Lincoln, in his address to
the jury, referring to this said:
"My triend on the other side is
all right, or would be all right
were it not for the peculiarity I
am about to chronicle. He can't
l 1- :i r? - '
ueip it. ror reasons which, gen
tlemen of the jury, you and I
have no time to study here, as
deplorable as they are surprising,
the oratory of the gentleman
completely suspends all action
of his mind. The moment he
begins to talk his mental operations
cease. I never knew of
but one thing which compared
with my friend in this particular.
That was a small steamboat.
Back in the days when I persormed
my part as a boatman I
made the acquaintance of a little
steamboat which used to bustle
and puff and wheeze about in
the Sangamon river. It had a
five-foot boiler and a seven-foot
whistle, and every time it whistled
it stopped."?Selected.

Tommy was undergoing chastisement
at the hands of his outraged
mother for eating the jam.
"Tommy," she said, "this hurts
me more than it does you."
And when Tommy was alone
he produced a square piece of
wood which he had placed
where it was needed, and murmured
reflectively: "I thought
that board wouldn't do her hand
any good."
Too Much Work
The "one-gallus" customer
drifted into a country store in
Arkansas.
"Gimme a nickel's worth of
asafetida," he drawled.
The clerk poured it out and
pushed it across the counter.
"Charge it," said the customer.
"What's your name?" asked
the clerk.
"Honeyfunkel."
"Take it for nothing," said the
shopman. I wouldn't write 4asa

five cents."
Airman Breaks World's Record
Newport News, V., May 4.?
Records for duration and dis
tance with six passengers were
established today before pilot E.
T. McCauley, flying the Curtis ;
hydroaeroplane, the largest in
the world, was forced to aban
don the flight to Baltimore and
back, on account of rain.
The machine had reached the
mouth of the Potomac River a
distance of 85 miles from the
city when a heavy rainstorm
broke as Point Lookout was being
passed.
The total distance of 170 miles
was covered in two hours and
23 minutes. The machine lefi
here at 1:35 o'clock and returned
at 3:58. McCauley stated that
there was not the slightest mis
hap during the flight and that he
is confident he could have made
the trip had not rain interfered.
McCauley's flight was the first
of its kind ever attempted in
America. Until today the
worlk's record for duration and
distance with six passengers was
held by a French aviator.

"But." protested .he patient,
"your sign reads: i'ainless extracting

a dollar."
"Certainly," replied the dentist.
"You remember that you
yelled a bit, so this does not apply
in your case. I do painles

not nninless nnd 1 ir?nlr?? o

One of the questions in an examination
on the subject of stock
raising was: "Name four different
kinds of sheep."
An aspiring youth gave this
for the answer:
"Black sheep, white sheep,
Marv's little lamb and the hydraulic
ram."
Little Eunice was attending
her first class in domestic science
and was asked to tell briefly the
surest way to keep milk from
souring. And Lunice, wlio was
an exceedingly practical child,
gave this recipe: "Leave it in the
cow."
