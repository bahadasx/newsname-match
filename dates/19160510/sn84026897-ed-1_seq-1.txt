pretty was the table of bouquets of
all kinds of flowers.
The judges for the show were
Mesdames P. X. Lott and James

put on the blue and red ribbons in
a way that show .1 they well knew
flowers and loved them. After the
flowers had been viewed,the Confed

many interesting things were seen.

vlife of Mr. B. W. Wright; ibis was

The Resurrection of the Flowers
Quadrupeds and Creeping
Things.
Editor The Advertiser: This is
the first day of May and I ara stand
ing at the foot hills of the Blue
Ridge mountains, looking-down up
on the Keowee river as it flows
through the beautiful valley, alonsr
whose banks the Ked men would
angle the trout and shad. Oconee
county has some of the prettiest
natural scenery that I have ever
seen: the rollins: hills, the bublirg
springs, the flowing brooks, the
beautiful waterfalls and the verdant
valleys. This is one of nature's open
books, like the Blue Ridge moun
tains, new every morning and fresh
every evening. If there was nothing
in the Bi ole to teach me that there
is a resurrection, this great open
book of nature would tell me that,
"if a man dies he shall live again."
The green foliage ol' the trees tells
me that, tile nuts, acorns and small
est seed tells me that there will be
a resurrection. They have been lay
ing dormant all the winter in their
icy beds and the brown leaves their
mantle, now as the gentle rays of
the sun warm them into life their
little shells will burst forth down
iii their leafy bed and you will see
the little bud peeping out of its
dark winter grave and as the gen
tle rays of the sun strike the bud
it is kissed into a beautiful flower
throwing into the air its sweet fra
grance, so much so that it attracts
the attention of the humming bird
and the honey bei;, and they suck
the sweet nectar from its little
bosom, and all "the while the little
birds are singing their sweetest car
ols. And all the four-footed quad
rupeds, reptiles and creeping tilings
are now waking up and coming out
from their long sleep. Nature teils ?
them that spring time is their res '
urrection morning. <
Mr. Editor if* any one wants to 1
know who hit Billy Patterson tell |1
them he is in Seneca city.But if the ''
I sheriff wants to know, tell bim .1

The New Courf House.
The following account of the com- I
pletion of the present court house i
was taken from an old copy of The I
Advertiser dated February 21, <
18:'.'.). Dr. LaBordeand Mr. William <
F. Durisoe were editors at that time: I
"The new court house is now corn- '
pie ted and we invite the citizens of <
the district and strangers to come 1
ami see it. It is a large and noble J
looking building, standing on the ?
western side of the great road lead- 1
ing to the upper country, and but I
a few yards distant from thc site of ;
the old court house.
The building is of brick and is
two stories in height. In the lower
story lhere are six looms, the sher
ill's office, the clerk's, tile cominis- I
sioners in equity, the ordinary's a .'
jury room, and a small apartment 1
adjacent to the clerk's office. A '
large and spacious passage runs be
tween the rooms. ]
The front of the edifice is at the '
southern end, and is painted so as (
to resemble granite. By a noble I
flight of granite steps, protected by '
block iron railings, the visitor as- I
cends into the porlieo which is sup- 1
ported by four massy columns. '
From thence he enters the court '
room, which is large and spacious, I
and contains a sufficient number of i
windows. Besides the seat for the 1
judge which is neat and those for I
the jury, there are others arranged (
conveniently for spectators. In the 1
court room there is a large semi- '
circular table for the gentlemen of
the bar. In the western end of the ?
upper story there are two jury roorni ;
and a small retiring room situated 1
immediately in the rear of the !
judges seat. As the visitor enters
the village by either of the great ?
thoroughfares the court house pre- ?
sents a commanding appearance,
and immediately attracts his atten
tion. In conclusion, it may be truly
said, that the style of the building
is chaste, and that it is an ornament
to the village.

"UNCLE IV" AGAIN.
His Letters Always Easily Read.
Georgia Farmers Suffering
From Drought and Cold
Winds.
It has bppn quite a while since I
have written yon, and am afraid
this will be rather a kind of sickly
note, as I am not feelinir at all well
this morning but don't think it is
because Geargia has gone dry on
the liquor question but may be
from inhaling 30 much sand and
dust. v
With the exception of a light
rain on the 3rd and 7th of Inst
month there has been none since the
last week in February. Those who
planted their cotton 4 weeks asro
have a fairly good stand but it is
so dry now that seed planted with
in the last two weeks will not come
up until it rains. The early planted
L*orn has about all been worked ever
hut it is growing very little. The
oats are not very high and I am
afraid will not be very full grained.
Some wheat sown early and manured
looks like it will make a line crup.
The wind has until the last few
lays been blowing since the last
week in February and has been real
jool weather, too cool for cotton to
io an.\ growing.
What am I doing? Well not
much of anything, as I ara but little
account in the farm, but I still set
the hens and build the coops for the
little chicks and take off the brood
when they hatch out and then see
them droop and die and if they
keep on dying'it will be no use for
any preacher to come to see us
thinking that fried chicken will be
Dn the table. Now don't want the
cacher that should chance to read
this to thin!; I mean tint all they
;ome for is to eat fried chichen. Oh
no but I have yet got to see one
.hat was not fond of fried chicken
and not at all partial to any breed.
Speaking of preachers, the fi rat
iveek in March 1 visited my chil
dren down in Emanuel county and
while waiting for the train I made
the acquaintance of a preacher
White and his father on their way
Lo visit a son and brother at St.
Clair. Since then I see an account
in Tho Advertiser of the death of
the old man. I certainly enjoy
id talking with the preach
er and during our conversation I
found ont that he was pastor of
little Stevens Creek church. The
t-hurch that your father was onee a
member of and il l make no mistake
pour mother and one or two of her
children united with the church at
:\u: same time and I shall never for
get the letter your father wrote Geo.
Hussey and he knowing how much
[ thought of Hanny, brought, me
the letter to read, a joyful letter
from a happy father.
Yes. I like to think of those days,
it does the old man good to recall
some things that happened or took
place years ayo, but there are some
things I would like to forget.
As I came home after my vist to
Emanuel who should I run up.on
but Nick Broadwater on his way to
Grovetown to visit his brother Hob
and what do you suppose was about
he first the first thing he said to
me. "Iv why don't you write more
lo The Advertiser." And my reply
was, "Well Nick I don't know that
what I write is worth the space it
takes up in the paper." And his re
ply to that was ' 'The first thing I
look for when my paper comes is
to see if there is anything from un
tjle Iv." We sat together on the
train till he got off and I had no
ticed just across the aisle two girls
who kept looking at Nick and I and
after he left the train one of the
girls said to me, you and the other
old gentleman were Confederate
soldiers were you not? And I told
her that we were and she then said
all the old soldiers seem to love one
another and I told her yes and as
we grew older the love for each
other grew stronger for all were
getting to be old men now and
whenever we meet each other we
need not expect to see each other
again in this life, especially if we
live some distance apart.
I visited my children in South
Carolina the first week in April and
went to the old Red Oak Grove on
the first Sunday feeling in ali
probability it would be the last
time,and I heard a sermon that does
rae good even now while I write.
The preacher's subject was "Jesus

Drought Hurtful to AH Crops.
Big Fish Fry on Turkey
(> Creek. School En
tertainment.
The dry weather has about put
farn>|vork at a stand-still. Cotton
hasn't come up and the ground is
too df.v to plant corn, except in bot
tom land. We had fine prospects
for a.grain crop two weeks ago, but
owing- to the dry weather it is voty
short;-* Some too low to cut. Mr.
Joe Brunson was up last week for
his annual fish on Turkey creek.
HP, with Mr. W. P. Brunson and
Mr. Steve Morgan, spent too nights
and one day on Moultrie's pond.
Had several ladies to take fish din
ner wi?h them on Saturday. Caught
aboiitT'what they could eat.
Mr. M. A. Mims spent Saturday
and Sunday with his daughter Mrs.
L. R;?Brnnson, recuperating from a
case of,grippe.
Judge N. L. and Mr. Joe Brim
son spent Sunday with Mr. L. R.
Bninsbn, Sr.
Mr? B. R. Thomas has been sick
for some time but is improving
now.
Mrsy'Georc e Strom has been on
the siesk list for a week but is bet
ter now.
Dr.'T. J. Pattison is living with
Mr. Bpnch Timmerman and is do
ing afgood jjpr?ctioe around hore.
It is a->great advantage to the com
munity'to have a doctor so conve
nient. We hope he will decide to
make tips his permanent home.
The Brunson school will close
next Friday the 12th and will have
an entertainment at night, will
charge a small admittance fee of
25cts fe. grown people to raise
funds fj)/ improving our school
building which we expect to re
modei'TOis . summer. All children
ande?^'admitted free. We hope to
have ???*,gc eiowd.
Mr." Edmunds and Mr. Barrett
have made wonderful improvements
in our roads. Straightening: the
crooks and changing the road-beds
where they had worn down until
they were nothing more than gullies
and could not be drained. A man
that saw them Saturday for the first I
time since they were worked, -said :
he didn't recognize them as the ?ame
road. Mr. Barrett certainly under- i
derstands his business, and can i
make a good road out of a bad one 1
with a minimum amount of work.
..lr. W. T. Reel will go to Bal- "
ti more soon to consult a specialist '
about his eyes. We hope he will '.
be benetitted.
We will soon begin to arrange
for our farmers institute which we 1
expect to hold about the first of
August. We expect to make this
an annual gathering.

Edgefield School Letter.
We were delighted to have Rev.
C. II. Dicky visit the school Mon
day morning and conduct the chapel
exercises. Rev. Dicky is a graduate
of Carson-Newman college, and a
very ? lose friend of Mr. Ross and
Mr. Copenbaver- Ile made a very
interesting talk, telling us some
thing of the work which Mr. Ross
is doing this year, and, also, of the
splendid record which Mr. Copen
haven made while at Carson-New
man col leg 3.
Mr. Lyon presented Diomede Hol
lingsworth with the bronze medal
which he won in Columbia. It was
more of a watch fob than a medal,
and bore the seal of South Caro
lina. We feel very proud of Dio
mede, and wish him success in all
future contests.
We are very sorry to report the
illness of Miss Ida Folk. We miss
her joviality considerably, and hope
she will soon be back with us.

And another thing that did me
so much good (Little preacher that
is what his young friends call him)
was to sit in the Bible class and
hear Geo. Bussey, Jr., teach it, and
my mind wandered back again to
days gone by, pleasant, happy days.
As far back as I can remember the
Bussey family have been leaders
and workers in the Red Oak Grove
church.
