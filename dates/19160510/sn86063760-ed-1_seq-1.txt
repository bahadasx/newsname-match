and sweeping 15 miles inland on Am
erican soil, raided the little settlement
of Glenn Springs and attacked a -de
tachment of American cavalry consist
ing of nine men of Troop A, the Four
teenth Cavalry.
Three troopers and a little 10-year
old boy were killed, two cavalrymen
were wounded and another is miss
ing. He is believed to be a prisoner
of the bandits who are now fleeing
southward into Coahuila, Mexico.
Two American citizens, J. Deemer,
and a man named Compton, accord
ing to reports received here, were
carried across the Rio Grande and re
ports have it that their throats were
cut. A posse of 50 citizens of Mara
thon are in pursuit of the Villistas.
The bandits' foray, carrying them
through the southern limits of Brew
stern county in the Big Bend district
of Texas, and taking in three little
settlements near the border-Glann
Springs, Boquillas and Deemers-took
place on Friday night and Saturday
morning, but news of it did not reach
here for several days.
Within an hour ' preparations had
begun for adequate action. Major
General Funston ordered four troops
of cavalry to the raided section to
reinforce small detachments already
on their way to the scene from Presi
dio, Alpine and other points. It is
said that if the exgienties of the case
demand such action they will cross the
border in order to run down and dis
perse the bandits. The forces consist
of two troops of the Eighth Cavalry
from Fort Bliss, El Paso, under Major
Langhorne ,and two troops of the
Fourteenth Cavalry from Fort Clark
under Colonel Sibley, commander bi
the Fourteenth.
General Scott and Funston met
General Obregon and Juan Amador,
Mexican Sub-Secretary of Foreign Af
fairs, in the immigration station at
the American end of the international
bridge for what had been expected to
be their final' conference. It develop
ed later, however, that practically the
only matter discussed wa sthe bandit

GERMAN RAIDERS FIRE ON
AND CHASE BIG LINER
Forty American Citizens Aboard.
News Alarms Shipping Circles.
New York-The steamship Venizia,
arriving here from Bordeaux, France,
with 40 American citizens abroad. was
only matter discussed was the bandit
by two commerce raiders, while off the
Azores, according to a story related
when the vessel docked.
Reports had been in circulation for
more than a week that at least one
sea raider was again operating In the
western Atlantic, and todays news
has alarmed shipping circles.
Captain Boniface and members of
the crew were reticent but the Amer
idans on board, who were employed in
caring for horses transported on the
* Venizia's last voyage eastward,
Touched for the story.
According to these men, the Veni
zia encountered the commerce raiders
April 28, three days out from Bor
deaux. The hostile craft, they said,
loomed up without any flags showing
and bore down upon the venizia. Cap
tain Boniface at once o.ecame suspi
cious and prepared for a sudden dash.
The raiders signalled to the Venizia
to slow down, but Captain Boniface's
answer was an order for full speed
ahead.
As the Venizla started away, ac
cording to the story, a shot passed
over her, this was followed by an
other which dropped close to the Ven
izia, but the efforts of the raiders to
overhaul her proved unsuccessful.
BRITISH SUBMARINE SUNK
*BY GERMAN GIUNFIRE.
Berlin, via wireless.-The British
submarine F,31 was sunk by the gun
fire of a German warship to the west
of Horns Reefs, off the west coast of
Denmark, on the morning of May 5, it
was announced by the German ad
miral. The admiralty report also an
nounces the destruction of a hostile
aeroplane by German airmen with the
help of a torpedo boat off the Flan
ders coast and the capture of another
aeroplane by torpedo boats.
Charlotte Observer :-Germany has
made frank admission, adequate sub
mission and just contention.
Richmond (Ya.) News-Leader:
Germany's reply to the American de
mands is a disingenuous effort to have
internation petty larceny put on the
same place as international murder
and visited with the same punishment.
Savannah (Ga.) Press:-The note
Is a document stamped with the
"Made in Germany" brand of diplo
macy. It is a play for further time
and t carries small assurance not
given before and promptly disre
,garded._________

UNITED STATES TO
ACCEPT ASSURANGE
WILL AWAIT FULFILLMENT OF
PROMISES CONTAINED IN
NOTE.
AVERT DIPLOMATIC BREAK
Imperial Government's Reply Has at
Least Postponed Any Diplomatic
Rupture With Teutons.
Washington.-It was stated authori
tatively that if the official text of Ger
many's note beards out the unoffclal
copy transmitted in news despatches,
the United States will accept the as
surance it contains and await a fulfill
ment of its promises.
Germany's note has postponed U1
it actually has not averted a diplo
matic break with the 'United States.
It was stated authoritatively after
the cabinet meeting that if the official
text bore out the unofficial version
transmitted in the Berlin news dis
patches. Germany's assurances un
doubtedly would be accepted and be
fore taking another step the United
States would await the fulfillment of
her latest promises.
In such cases the United States
might not reply to the note and would
await evidence of the actual abandon
ment of Germany's present practices
of submarine warfare which is declar
ed. President Wilson is described by
those close about him as being in a
position where he cannot question the
good faith of Germany's assurances
which must stand or fall by the future
conduct of her submarine command
ers.
The German Embassy view is that
the note gives all President Wilson
asked for; that it signalizes a return
to "cruiser warfare"-the use of sub
marines as regular naval cruisers in
tercepting commerce with visit and
search, and that inasmuch as It makes
no mention of the armed ship ques
tion. that perplexing feature of the
controversy is not involved.
Congress took the note quietly and
although members expressed a vs
riety of views the general sentimeni
seemed to be in favor of leaving the
situation in the hands of President
Wilson.

Columbia,
The mill village demonstration
work is to be resumed in South Car
lina under the leadership of James
L. Carbery. the originator of the plan
to improve conditions in mill villages.
the work was begun several years
ago at Rock Hill by Mr. Carbery.
When the Smith-Lever act went into
effect the appropriation was cut off by
te United States department of agri
ulture on the ground that the work
ould not be classed under the head
)f agriculture. From Rock Hill the
work spread to 20 mills in the state.
Following the withdrawal of fed
aral support Gov. Manning in a mes
sage to the legislature urged that a
state bureau of welfare work be creat
d. Bills were introduced in the
ouse and senate. The house bill
passed without a dissenting vote and
he measure was sent to second read
ng in the senate. Before the bill
was finally passed the legislature ad
ourned. The measure was to have
)een taken up at the last session of
he legislature, but word came that
ederal aid was to be extended and
hat the state bureau was unneces
;ary.
When the federal government with
irew support from the work Mr. Car
ery went to Beaufort as county farm
lemonstrator. Several weeks ago he
-eturned to Rock Hill and is actively
ngaged in organizing the clubs in the
ills of South Carolina.
The objects of the mill village dem
nstration work are as follows: Home
,ardens. summer and winter; home
anning. horticulture. fruit, shrub
yery, flowers, planting and propaga
:ion. landscape work, home sanita
ion, elimination of breeding places of
lies and mosquitoes, club work, jun
ors from 8 to 1S years of age, sen
ors over 18 years old, Irish potatoes,
torn and pig, plant diseases and in
ect pests. The allied interests are:
:llustrated lectures. agricultural
;chools. field meetings. night meet
ngs and mill village fairs. The gov
trnmen' is prepared to furnish ex
erts on the above subjects for the
)enefit of the people of the mill vil
.ages.
Several prizes will be offered to the
nembers of the junior tomato club

"It is hoped that it will ha" possible

f organizing two troops of cavalry,"
says Gen. A. L. Mills. chief of staff of

alina.
Petitions have been fiied by cavalry
troops from Charleston and Columbia.
snd the militia council several days
sgo recommended that both be ac
~epted if possible. The letter from!
he war department gives assurance
hat b:>th troops will be mustered into
ie service. provided they have proper
ocal backing.
"If a troop of cavalry is to be author
zed in Columbia, the people must give
:he proper financial support," said
Adt. General Moore. "and per-sonally
will contributC $10 toward the sur
port of the troop."
"Whie only one troop is alotted
to South Carolina," said Gen. Mills.
"the war department will be pleased
o have the State or-ga:nize and main
tain two troops; the Ninth militia di
rision of which the organized militiaI
af Soth Carolina forms a part. is de
fient in cavalry, and a remedy for

Urges Better System of Distributing. a
and Marketing of Farm Products t
In South and West.
Washington.-E. J. Watson of South d
Carolina was elected president and Dr. d
Clarence J. Owens of Washington ex- al
ecutive secretary of the National As
sociation of Commissioners of Agricul- bi
ture, inaugurated at a meeting here.
Resolutions indorsing the bill for
the proposed national chamber of ag
riculture were adopted. in
Dr. Owens, who is enthusiastic con-;
cerning what he hopes will be accom- ac
plished along this line said that this
was the first time that commissioners ei
of all the 48 states had been present. C
to discuss the needs of the farmer. re
"It is indeed worthy of note," he
said, "when the commissioners of ag- al
riculture from all of the states come P1
together in the interest of the farmers in
of their respective states and the na- at
tion. It means that there is a quick- yE
ening of the mind as to the require- Iy
ments of our biggest undertaking-ag- W
riculture."
It is good for South Carolina that
both of the officers elected tonight are
Palmetto state men. Mr. Watson is c
well known throughout the country, nE
and Dr. Owens is originally from in
Orangeburg. The latter's work along of
industrial and agricultural lines during tr
the past few years has been rast suc
essful.
The sessiorns will continue another p
day, af:er which Mr. Watson will pro- pi
eed to New York in his autombile. of
Commissioner Watson addressed the ot
association at the first session after: tu
the organization. He spoke in behalf bt
of a better system of distributing or al
marketing farm products, and present- to
ed some of the features incorporated bi
by the German system of distribution. tu
The association is planning a cam- ca
paign to provide for the organization
of a National Chamber of Agriculture ca
under Federal charter. The basic gr
purpose of the national chamber will al
be to solve the problems of distribu- M
tion. The organization resembles a H
part of the Landwirtschaftsrat of Ger- Yj
many. which regenerated the rural
life of Germany to the extent that 86
per cent of the farmers are land own-1
ers in contrast yith 64 per cent in the iye

r State Gives Aid to Weak Schools.
The state department of education
completed the payment of state aid
from the contingent fund of $40,000
appropriated by the legislature. Dis
bursements were made to 311 schools
in 32 counties. Amounts ranged from
2 $6 to buy blackboards at Fingerville
I In Spartanburg county to $750 to help
run the Antioch Industrial school sey
en months. The Antioch district en
rolls 325 pupils and pays a local school
tax of 16 mills. The patrons contrib
uted $500 additional in order to secure
V this allotment of state aid for their
t seven months' term.
"The appropriation has been used
mainly," said J. E. Swearingen, state
superintendent of education, "to se
cure a minimum. In order to stimu
late local taxation or private contri
2 butions, state contingent aid has been
given in rare instances for a term of
seven months. To catalogue the va
rious items in the 311 schools would
be to make a list of the school activi
ties of the state. The appropriation
has been used as far as possible to
equalize facilities in ~ the various dis
tricts. These minor deficiencies have
been too long overlooked. The first
attempt to remedy them was made in
1914, when representatives from some
of the country districts secured an ap
propriation of $45,000 for equalizing
purposes. In 1915 this appropriation
was raised to $60,000; but the legisla
ture of 1916 reduced the amount to
$40,000.

EVOLUTION OF SPEED
WRITER HAS TRACED ITS PROG
RESS THROUGH CENTURIES.
All of Man's Ingenuity, However, Has
Not Caused Him to Devise Means
to Travel Faster Than
the Little Swallow.
Those twittering swallows have
something to twit about. Until an
hour ago I thought of them only as
friendly decorations in the sky. Now
I see them in their true light, as
man's rivals in the struggle for speed
supremacy.
I was sitting by a sunny bay win
dow, overlooking a stretch of the main
street in a sleepy Southern village. In
all the landscape nothing had stirred
for half an hour but the swallows, a
passing motor car, and a schoolboy
racing An its wake in the vain hope of
"b ,sing" a ride. Motion, however
even so little of it as this-has a way
of monopolizing our attention from
everything else. It set me to thinking
about speed; wondering, In particu
lar, how motor cars and swallows and
self-propelled humans compared in
the world's record. I got down a
newspaper almanac, a pad of paper,
and a pencil, and began to enliven
some slow moments by tracing the
dizzy evolution of speed.
The standing of the self-propelled
human, I soon enough discovered, was
pitifully low in the averages. In his
lightest apparel and favored with
spiked shoes and a well-rolled track of
cinders, the best that the best man
among us can run a mile in is at a
rate that would carry him only 14
miles an hour. Even If human mus
e could maintain for an hour the
ae of a world's championshIp 100
yard dash, our record would be only
1miles and a small fraction.
But see how man's pride and his
st for speed have urged him to ex
edents. Mounted on the best of race
borses he has managed to have him
sef propelled for a mile at a rate of
iarly 40 miles an hour.
By inventing the bicycle he then
rzised the rate at which he could
over a mile at a speed of 54 1-3 miles
n hour. The motor cycle almost
ucceeded In doubling this pace. Its
te for the mile is 100.
Meanwhile, man was developing
Dther inventions. In a locomotive he
ttained a speed, over a short course,
f120 miles an hour. He experiment
adwith flying machines, until in the
astest monoplanes he managed to hurl
timself through the air at a rate of
31 and one-half more miles an hour
han he had been able to force out of
a.railway engine. This rate is enough

Elwks and vultures, our scientists
ay, can attain a speed of 150 miles

apin short-distanlce swoops and
purts they also can maintain their
reater speed over long courses. On

.2 miles an hour. No world's chain

hi for such a distance.
Man is swiftly progressing; he can

OLD COURT PROCEDURE
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM
THAT OF THE MODERN DAY.
Elaborate Ceremonial and Dignified
Proceedings Were Frequently Die
pensed With In the Early Days
of the Country.
"Oyes! Oyes! Oyez! Know ys
all that the honorable circuit court
of Peoria county now stands convened.
pursuant to adjournment."
This is the impressive ceremony
used and the words spoken aloud when:
circuit court judges step to the bench.
In federal courts all spectators and at
taches are required to arise and re
main standing until the coart has been
seated.
In the days of 1818 to 1830 things
were different, as early historical rec
ords show, observes the Peoria Trib
une. Records of those days-show one
incident in which Judge John Rey
nolds was seated on the circuit bench
in Washington county when the fol
lowing procedure was followed:
"Boys, come in. Our John is going
to hold court," the sheriff said to the
spectators, jurors and attorneys who
had gathered on the grass in the court
house yard.
The courts in those days were held
mostly- in log houses or.in barrooms
of village taverns fitted un for the par.
pose, with a temporary bench for the
court and benches and chairs arranged
for the jurors, lawyers and spectators.
In general, the judges were adverse
to rendering decisions on points of law
and preferred to submit all questions
to the jurors for a decision.
One instance is cited when attorneys
requested the court to instruct the ju
rors on questions of law. The judge
after rubbing his head and face with
his hands and reflecting a few mo
ments, said to the lawyers:
"Why, gentlemen, the jury under-.
stands It; they need no Instructions;
no doubt they will do justice in this
case."
The same justice presided In a case
of a man named Green who was con
victed of murder. It became the un
pleant duty of the judge to pass sen
tence upon the- man.. He called the
prisoner before him and said:
"Mr. Green, the jury says you are
guilty of murder and the law says you
are to be hung. I want you and all of
your friends down on Indian creek to
know that It Is not I who condemn you.
It Is the jury and the law. Mr. Green,
what time would you like to be hung?
The law allows you time for prepared
ness."
"I am ready at any time, your honor.
Those who kill the body have no power
to kill the soul. My preparation Is
made and I am ready," was the reply
of the prisoner at the bar.
"Mr. Green, It is a very serious mat
ter to be hung; It can't happen to a
man but once in his life. You had bet
ter take all the time allowed. I will
give you until this day four weeks."
was the sentence of the court.
James Turney, attorney general,
who was prosecuting the case, remind
ed the court that it was the duty of the
judge to warn the prisoner of the con
sequences he was facing, to reprove
him for his guilt, and to warn him
against the judgment in the world to
come. The court replied:
"Oh, Mr. Turney, Mr. Green under
stands the whole matter; he knows he
has got to be hung; you understand
it, don't you, Mr. Green?"
No Wonder She Chuckled.
In a name there was embarrass
ment for one woman. Her name was
Mrs. Fish. In the lobby of a Broad
way hotel she met Mrs. Roach, and
while she was conversing with her
along came Mrs. Crabb. "Why, this
Is a pleasure, Mrs. Fish," breezily said
Mrs. Crabb. Mrs. Fish saw the em
barrassment of the situation and hesl
tated before Introducing M.rs. Crabb
to Mrs. Roach. And when she did Mrs
Crbb, who was a youthful matron,
saw the humor of the situation and
gave vent to a loud chuckle. Mrs.
Roach was a dignified woman who had
crossed-the Rubicon of life. she froze
up Immediately. "Who Is this bols
terous person, Mrs. Fish?" she asked, 7
at the same time giving Mrs. Crabb
the Icy stare. "I must be going, any
way; so glad to have met you." And
as Mrs. Roach departed Mrs. Fish
and Mrs. Crabb, who were both young
enuhto be in the swim, laughed up
roariously.
