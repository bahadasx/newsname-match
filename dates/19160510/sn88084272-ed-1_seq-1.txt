Moraht, military critic of the Tage

war by the use of Heavy artillery was
only a prelude to the artillery opera

"The French have no been able to
compete with German artlllerj and

the Trench are due partly to the ef

to the tenacity of the French, who will
not abandon their trenches
"Although it Is generallj considered
that attacking forces must be four
times superior to those of the defence.
In the Verdun campaign the number of
German troops engaged Is much less
than half that of the French. The
number of French troops may be cal
