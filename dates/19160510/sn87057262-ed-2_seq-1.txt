EL PASO, Texa9, May 10.—General
Bcott held the whip hand today la
kk negotiations with War Minister
Obregon. For the first time the
Jtavericaa forcee available for duty
along the border In Mexico were
Bumerioally superior to the Mexican
troops and military officials believed
Obregon'a Whiff has 3een called. An
other conference between the war
heads is expected today and autJhor
tfJeg confidently expected full agree
ment of details of the original plan.
While Scott obdurately refused to
listen to any plan involving a time
limit on the expedition, American
military preparations were PTOgrees
ln* rapidly to th«ow seven thousand
additional men within striking dk»
tanoe «f Mmx&eo. Neither Soott nor
General Finurton underestimatea the
danger ot an explosion which no
diplomatic, action ooold repair. Obre"
gon is imderstood to 'be directing mili
tary movements in ChihtMbua state,
and both commanders are dispersing
to avert, if possible, a sudden clash
between Americans and Carranziatas.
Obregon lost no time seeking a con
ference, after President Wilson or
dered the Texas, Arizona and New
Mexioo militia to the border. Juan
Amador, under secretary of foreign
relations, motored to E3 Paso soon
after the news was received in Juarez
and asked a resumption of the con
ferences on behalf of Obregon.
The meeting lasted two hours.
Obregon submitted a proposition for
the Americans to return to Che border
and from their own soil oo-operate
with an equal number of Carranzistas
In wiping out the bandits. Scott
promptly turned the proposition
down. When the meeting ended, the
conferees accepted Scott's invitation
to lnnch in his private car and,
parting, the men appeared entirely
friendly, promising resumption of
negotiations today.
American officials were confident
today that an agreement will be
reached, possibly in this afternoon's
meeting. The American attitude is
plain. Obregon knows what Scott
wlli concede.
In view of these facts, military
authorities could foresee but one
outcome if the negotiations continue,
namely, an agreement granting the
points the Americans have con
tended for. .V'-v.

force the border patrol, supplemented
by orders late last night dispatching
eleven coast artillery companies and
five field artillery batteries to San
Antonio.
While offlclalB assume Carranza is
acting in good faith, they admit his
attitude is surprising in view of the
fact that several days ago, Obreg#n
and Scott reached an agreement
which President Wilson later infor
mally approved.
They cannot explain why. In these
circumstances, new demands for a
time limit on the American expedi
tion have been made. They say
frankly the situation has become
graver, suddenly In the past few
days by Carranza "manana" tactics
But they see in Obregon's latest re
fcorUd compcomise plau, a fti8P. ihat
the Carranza regime is impressed by
the new troop orders aAd is perhaps
preparing to yield ultimately to the
American terms.
The situation as outlined reliably
to the United Press is this:
This government had supposed the
Scott-Obregon agreement practically
in effect and that Carranka would
approve it in as much as it was con
tracted by his chief military officer.
Border raids occurred In the mean
time. These bad to be oftecked. More
over, there are evidences of manipu
lation of such actives from th*
American side. For this reason,
these additional troops were sent.
Stripping the eleven coast, artllery
companies from Oalveston to Dela
ware and sending the field artillery
from Fort Sill, Okla., was discussed
yesterday, but not actually deter
mined until nearly midnight last
•night.
The effect of moving fresh forces
to the boundary will be according
to the administration view:
Prevention of border raids.
Possibly persuasion of Obregon to
give up his time limit demands and
to stand on the agreement made sev
eral days ago.
Stopping of plotting on the Ameri
can side.
Possibility that the additional
troops would inflame the Mexicans is
discounted by officials. They think,
to the contrary, that it will quell any
post trouble.
As for intervention, the administra
tion believes these very steps are
preventing it and while taking a
grave view of the situation, tempor
arily, officials told the United Press
that they are optimistic as to the fu
ture.

BERLIN, (via wireles* to 8ayville)
May 10.—More than a million men
are now engaged on both sides 'n the
renewal of heavy fighting around the
fortress of Verdun, it was semi-offi
cially statsd here today.
"While It Is generally, considered
that the attacking forces must be four
times' superior to the defending, the
German troops really number- less
than one-half the French forces en
gaged, which are not leas than 800,
000," said the statement. "These fig
ures represent half of the entire
force which France still has at her
disposal for active fighting.
"The second Germsn attack against
Verdun is based on the crushing ef
fect of heavy German artillery. The
taking of small western fortresses at
the beginning of the war by heavy
artillery was only a prelude to the
artillery results being attained today.
At any rate the French have been un
able to compete with German artil
lery and ammunition. The enormous
French losses are due partly to the
effect of German artillery and partly
to the tenacity of the French who
will not abandon their trenches."
Major Morant, German military
critic, pointed, out today that all the
German successes on the east and
west front were gained sgalnst enemy
forces numerically superior and that
the Austrlana, for a year, have held
back an Italian foroe twice as strong
numerically/'
"In the Argonne, the enemy, after
blasting, attempted to enter our lines,
but was repulsed," slaid the official
statement. "Southwest of Hill 304
the enemy's advanced detachments
were driven farther back and one en
emy picket was captured. The new
German positions on 'Hill 304 were ex
tended. German flyere copiously
bombarded factories at Dombasle and
Raon-Le-Tape.
"On the east front, a Russian at
tack aouth of Garbunovka on a small
front was repuleed. The enemy suf
fered heavy losses. No events of
spec)*! Importance have .occurred «n
the Balkan front."

BERLIN, May 10. (Via wire lees to

Lansing's position heretofore fre

"If advance reports we have receiv

"President Wilson's answer is what
was expected. If he emphatically de
clares that he will not acknowledge
any conditions attached to the change
in submarine warfare, then he is
knowingly kicking open a door al

contained no such conditions.
"The German note only expressed':
the Idea that Germany did not doubt:
that after settling the submarine dis
pute, America would induce England
to preserve international law. Ger-.
many merely reserved freedom of de
cision in the event America failed.
The result is that even President Wil

President Wilson, who always main-,

Attacked Without Warning.
LONDON, May 10.—American Con
sul Frost at Queenstown today wired
confirmation of press reports that the
White Star liner Cymric, torpedoed
Monday afternoon with the loss of
five lives, was attacked without warn
ing.
Frost also confirmed the statement
that there were no Americans aboard
the Cymric and that she was not
armed.
It was authoritatively stated today
that the Cymric was not in admiralty
service. As an ordinary merchantman,
she was entitled to all the immuni
ties granted by Germany in her
pledges to the United States in the
reply to the American note. Special
despatches all agree that the Cymric
did not attempt to escape.
Captain Beadnell was quoted as
saying that the Cymric was torpedoed
without, warning and that no subma
rine was seen though several of the
crew saw the wake of the torpedo.
One or two officers, however, declared
they saw a submarine which sub
merged just before a torpedo crashed
through the engine room, killing four
men outright. A fifth was drowned in
attempting to enter a boat.
War munitions valued at more than
$1,000,000 went down with the ship.
