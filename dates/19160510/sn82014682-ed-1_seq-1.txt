CENTRAL SUGAR
I
IS SUCCESSFUL
Hawaiian Plan as Adopted in
Philippines is Working
Satisfactorily
That the adoption of central sugar
grinding plants in the Philippines, fol
lowing the methods used in Hawaii
sod' On the mainland, has resulted in
notable success, making a higher
grade of sugar possible, and enabling
planters to realize better prices for
their product, was stated today by
Christian J. Hedemann, manager of
the Honolulu Iron Works, who return
ed this morning on the China Mail
liner China, after passing four months
in the Orient and studying the Phil
ippine sugar industry carefully while
away.
"In-the beginning. Philippine sugar,
planters were a little reluctant to con-
plants, said Mr. Hedemann. 'How
ever, the centrals built. at San' Carlos
and Calamba have enabled them to
stop the old antiquated mills and dis
pose of their cane to the centrals.
"The Calamba central is now offer,
ed far more cane than it can grind
with its present milling plant and
this will be still more the case next
year. The principal reason for the
centrals has been that with the high
cost of transporting Philippine sugar
to New York, with freight rates up to
Unprecedented figures, it does not pay
to export a low quality of sugar to the
mainland. The sugar must be of a
higher grade and of a higher value t
