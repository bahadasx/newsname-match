MEREDITH ON ROADS.
I do not assume to anticipate the
action of the Democratic State Con
vention which in July will express
In its platform the crystalled sen
timent of the Democracy of Iowa up
on the question of good roads as well
as upon other live issues but as a
candidate in the primaries for the
office of Governor, 1 do wish to
state my position that the people of
Iowa may know exactly where I
stand.
I am for better roads than we
now have in Iowa, both because of
what it moans to the state in de
velopment along social lines, and be
cause good roads are real money
makers ftr the farmers who live
upon them and bring a real advance
In the value of lands adjacent to the
highways.
I do not advocate that roads be
built of brick, cement, asphalt or
other costly materials, hut I do
urge the us© of gravel whenever
available or can be procured at a
reasonable cost. 1 am In finer of
having the roads so graded and sur
faced that they pay be 3«5
a a
tax /levies: local .nr. dollar.
This ibonejr now paid to taxes wat
ft spenl properly and under a com
prehensive plan, pay lor permanent
roa^s without increasing the burdens
of taxation.
The people of the communities to
be served by the road must have a
voice in determining by their votes
first whether they want the Improv
ed road and second what kind of a
road they shall have. I am net in
favor of forcing improved roads
upon any community that does not

Are we going to be forced to forfeit our place among
the accredited schools of the state? By erecting there new
buildings, we will relieve the condemned conditions and
still hold our enviable position among the best schools, giv
ing to our children advantages equal to those of the chil
dren in other communities of this size. That the voters
may have presented to them every material fact before
election day, the following information is furnished and
vouched for:
The Wkst Side school has been declared by the state
inspector to be insanitary, and badly constructed for school
purposes. The West Side is entitled to consideration, at
thin time, and should have as good school facilities as the
rest of the city, which it has not had in the past.
Upon the petition of 160 voters of the school district
the board of directors have called an election to be held
at the Council Chamber In the city of Manchester, Iowa,
