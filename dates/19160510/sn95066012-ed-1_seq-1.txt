of the crew of the Cymric arrived at
Bantry this evening. Several, suffering
from broken limbs, were sent to the
hospital.
Officers of the Cymric declare the
vessel was torpedoed without warning.
A submarine was seen, but it dis
appeared immediately after firing the
torpedo.
The Cymric, although badly damag
ed, proceeded for some hours but final

Many of the crew, on their arrival
here, were bare footed and only partly

Has 24 Strike-Outs ' In a Nine Inning
Game to His Record.
The record of 24 strike-outs in a
nine Inning game, credited to Pitcher
Davis of Killeen, Texas, high school
team in the contest against the Bolton
H. S. nine, appears .to rank with any
pitching feat now recorded in the an
nals of baseball. So far as it is shown
by the leading complications on base
.ball, the feat stands iu a class by it
self. Whether It is a w orld's record is
hard to determine because unusual
pitching exhibitions by amateur,
school and college teams are not kept
with the same care that is devoted to
those of the major and minor leagues.
So far as the records show it is the
best strike-out performance for a nine
inning game to be found among the
available data in existence today. A
careful search disclosed that the Na
tional league record of strike outs, un
der similar conditions, is 19, made by
Charles Sweeney in the Providence
Boston game of June 7, 1884. The
American league record was made by
the late George (Rube) Waddell who
fanned 16 in the contest between St.
Louis and the Athletics on July 29,
1908.
Pitcher Dailey struck out 19 in a
Union association game between
Chicago and Boston on July '7, 1884;
Tom Ramsey turned 17 batters back
'to the bench in an American associa
tion contest between Louisville and
Cleveland on June 2, 1887 and this
was a remarkable performance as at
that time the four strike rule was in
existence. On Aug. 21, 1909 Wil
liam Mitchell fanned 20 batters in a
Texas league game involving San An
tonio and Galveston. During the
year 1912 Frank Davis of the Knox-
vllle, Appalachian league club and
Fred Applegate of the Blue Grass
league, also fanned 20 batters. A
A. Stagg, now coach of the University
of Chclago, while a student at Yale
struck out 20 Princeton batters in the
Yale-Princeton game of May 2C, 1888,
and this is probably the best college
record to date.

GREEN MOUNTAIN CLUB
Sixth Annual Meeting at Brandon
&7- ' 'Miual meeting
Miual meeting of the
Green M
'ub of Vermont will
be held at tlit
" Inn on Friday.
May 19,
with the section of
the club.
There will be a meeting of the coun
cil at 9 o'clock in the forenoon, the gen
eral business meeting comes at 11 and
will be continued at the afternoon ses
sion. Several proposed amendments
to the constitution are to be acted up
on. Notification of attendance should be
made to E. S. Marsh, president of the
Brandon section.
With the notices announcing the ann
ual meeting the following circular let-'
ter describing the work of the club
during the year was inclosed:
The Johnson section, which has done
such splendid work in building a trail
over Sterling mountain, continued
their good work toward Sterling Pond.
Much trail over Sterling mountain was
destroyed by lumbering operations, and
in the summer of 1915 Mr. F. W. Mould
of Morrisville spent one day in about
very two weeks personally working
with an axe on Sterling mountain
trails, and also put up many arrows
of his own manufacture, for which the
special thanks of the club are due hira.
Hamcs' Camp in Smugglers Notch,
beloved by every hiker who was ever
welcomed there by its former genial
host, Willis M. Barnes (now engaged in
lumbering operations a few miles dis
tant) was managed very successfully
from July 13 to September 21st by
three students from the University of
ermont, Roderick M. Olzendam, Per-
y H. Slayton, Leroy M. Anderson, wno
furnished meals, lodging, and guides
at reasonable rates. Their cooking,
courtesy and especially their imma
culate house-keeping were praised
without stint by all house-wives and
prospective house-wives who were so
fortunate as to ba entertained by them.
It is expected that this camp will be
onducted by university students this
oming summer.
The Camels Hump club of Water-
bury kept their building near the sum
mit of the Hump open from July un
til the middle of November. Louis A.
Babcock, an experienced traveler, was
in charge and rendered himself most
agreeable to the guests.. About one
mile of the new trail from Callahan's
to the summit was relocated on higher
and dryer ground. The State forestry
tfoiwrtroent built a new trail up th
Hump from Jonesville, yia Honey Hol
low and the slide on the west side of
the mountain intersecting tho Hunt
ington trail 3-4 mile west of the sum
mi;.
Many parties visited the Hump dur
ing the'summer and on February 22
party of seven women and seven
men from Burlington made the ascent
on snowshoes from North Duxbury.
Other smaller snowshoo parties also
made the ascent.
The Bennington section have the
Long Trail completed from the Massa-
husetts line to the summit of Strat-
ton Mountain, a distance of 3t miles
from the Massachusetts line, and by
July 1st will have the trail extended
6 miles fuither north to Irospect Rock,
about two miles east of Manchester.
The state forestry department have
built a very comfortable shelter camp
short distance below the summit of
Stratton mountain. The Stratton
mountain club and the state forestry
department erected a steel observa
tion tower in 1914 on the summit of
Stratton mountain.
Prof. Will S. Monroe of the Slate
Normal school at Montclair, N. J., a
very extensive traveller and tho auth
or of several books, was a teacher at
the summer school at tho University of
Vermont in the summer of 1915, and
made many week end excursions into
the Green mountains. During the
holidays he joined a large party of the
Appalachian club people from New
York and Boston who spent several
days snowshoelng. skiing und skating
and coasting nt Manchester, and se
cured ten of their members as nicni
bers of our club. This summer he
plans to come to Vermont June 20th
and spend two weeks before the Uni
versity Summer school opens in cut
ting new trail for the club In company
with three other club members him

REQUEST NOT CONSIDERED
Protocol Halted for Another Confer
ence Which is Probably Being
Held Today.
El Paso, Texas, May 9. Fear of a
break between the United States and
Mexico over American troop disposi
tions in Mexico was allayed tonight
when, after a three and a half hours'
discussion. Generals Scott and Obre-
gon, the American and Mexican con
ferees, agreed to hold another confer
ence, probably tomorrow.
The conference today began shortly
after 5 o'clock, with Generals Scott,
Funston, and General Alvaro Obregon
and Juan Amador, Mexican sub-sec
tary of foreign affairs, taking part.
A. J. McQuatters. mining man, who
has participated in three other confer
ences, was present at the beginning,
but withdrew on complaint of the
Mexican representatives that his busi
ness connections rendered his pres
ence undesirable.
It is understood that General Obre
gon again brought up the subject of a
definite date for American troop with
drawal from Mexico. He again was in
formed, it was said, that the American
government was firm in Its refusal to
make this concession. It was suggest
ed to him that in view of the Big Bend
raid, under the nose of Carranza
troops, the United States scarcely
could consider the do facto Govern
ment fully capable of coping with the
bandits.
In the face of this statement General
Obregon is understood to have asked
for more time to consult with General
Carranza.
FOREST FIRES LAST YEAR
Unusually Exposed Season but Dam
age Lest Than Usual.
Forest fires burned over not uiiitc
300,000 acres of national forest land
in 1915, according to official reports
just compiled, or less than two acres
per thousand. Out of a total of 0,324
tires, 346 or 5 12 per cent, did dam
age to the amount of $100 or more.
The timber loss was 156.000.0ft0
board feet, valued at 1190,000. Ah
though the season was regarded as ono
of unusual exposure, owing to delayed
fall rains, the loss was materially be
low the average of the last five years.
Over 87 per cent of this Iofs occurred
in the states of Oregon, Washington
and Idaho, whilo more than 72 per
cent was in Oregon alone. Besides the
timber loss, fire destroyed reproduc
tion, or young tree growth, of an esti
mated value of $160,000. and $S,407.
worth of forests. The loss per fire In
1915 was $60.41, which is $14.06 loss
than the five-year uverage, while the
cost of fighting each fire was $20.83
less.
Lightning figures as the chief cause
of forest fires in 1915, as it does In the
average year. Twenty-eight . and a
half per cent of the fires were duo to
this cause. Campers caused 18 per
cent, which is 2 1-2 per cent higher
than the average. Eleven ier cent
were caused by brush burning. Near
ly 11 per cent were of incendiary
origin. Railroads were responsible for
nearly 9 per cent of the fires of 1915,
against 14 1-2 per cent duo to this
cause in the average year. The causes
of over 15 per cent were unknown.
Lumbering operations caused less than
3 per cent.

EXPLAINS PRIMARY LAW
Republican
Committee Urges
To Turn Out.
Voters
Chelsea, May 9. That the value of
"any nominating or election machin
ery depends upon the actual use made
of it by the voters themselves" is the
declaration of the republican state
committee in auf announcement deal
ing with the application of the new
primary law, signed by Stanley C.
Wilson, of this place, chairman, and J.
Rolfe Searles, ot St. Johnsbury, sec
retary, and addressed to the Republi
cans of Vermont. The state commit
tee announces its desire to do any
thing it may, "consistent with an im
partial attitude, to assist the Republi
can voters and Republican committees
to fui ther the true intent of the pri
mary law by securing as full a vote
with as fair an expression of prefer
ence for president as possible on May
16." The committee urges members
of the party to attend the polls on that
day. The statement of the committee
reads as follows:
"There appears to be so much mis
understanding with reference to the
application of the new primary law
and the relation between the primar
ies, caucuses, and conventions to be
held next month, that the state com
mittee deem advisable a few, sugges
tions which are In effect answers to
questions that have already been
raised.
"The primaries to be held on May
16 are unlike the primaries to be
held in September. The presidential
primaries to be held in May are pref
erential only, thus giving tho voters
an opportunity to express their pref
erence for a candidate for president
but not doing away with the custom
ary caucuses ana conventions. Cau
cuses will be held as usual at which
delegates will be elected to attend the
state convention, where delegates to
the national convention will bo elec
ted. One change, however, should be
noted, viz., that all of the delegates
from Vermont to the national conven
tion will be elected at the state con
vention instead of there being four elec
ted at such contention and two each at
strict conventions in the respective
congressional districts, as heretofore.
"The primaries to be held on May
16 will be under the state law and in
charge of election officers the same
as at a regular election. The cau
cuses are purely a party affair and
held exactly as In former years.
'The state primaries to be held in
September will be direct primaries
and tho voters at those primaries
will nominate, their candidates for
state and county officers and town
representative. The'rc will be no cau
cuses culled for in September, as the
faLo convention for the formation of
platform will bo then made up of
the nominees of the party for state
and county officers and town repre
sentatives throughout the state.
Town committees should therefore, be
lected at the caucuses in May.
"The value of any nominating or
election machinery depends upon tho
actual use made of it by the voters
themselves. The state committee
stands ready to do anything it may,
consistent with an impartial attitude,
to assist the Republican voters and
Republican committees to further
the true Intent of the primary law by
securing as full a vote with as fair
an expression of preference for pros
ident as possible on May 16. This
committee urges that local commit
tees use their efforts to get out the
Republican voters both to the prlinar
ies and to tho caucuses which will be
held on the same day, there to record
their ral wishes. The state commit
tee expects later to Issue a pamphlet
briefly summarizing tho law which
will bear on the September nominn
tlons and November elections. Mean
while we hope local committees will
examine published copies of the law
and familiarize themselves with this
provision so far as they can."

GAME WARDEN 15 YEARS
Arthur M. Nichols Has Seen Long
Term of Service in Berkshlres.
Arthur M. Nichols of North Adams,
who Is well known in this village, re
cently completed his 15th year as
deputy game warden for northern
Berkshire and a part of Franklin coun
ties, Mass. As a recognition of his
long service in the fish and game de
partment he was given a surpriso
I arty at his home by a number of his
friends who presented him a handsome
gold game warden's badge.
AVriting of Mr. Nichols unusual
term of service in Massachusetts fish
and Rame iiepartinent, the editor, of
the North Adams Transcript says:
"For fifteen years, Arthur M. Nic
hols has held the olnce of deputy gamo
warden for northern Berkshire and a
part of Franklin counties. The first
paid deputy warden in the state, he
has "grow n up with the service.
Starting at a tlnio when there were
few if any game laws, he has seen tho
service grow to its present state of
efficiency. He has aided very material
ly in the framing of some ot the better
laws for the protection of iisli and
gamo by his timely suggestions. Ho
has enforced the law without fear or
favor, and yet, withal, fewer men in
the state can boast of more friends
than Arthur M. Nichols.
"Fifteen years of service in a posi
tion like this means a lot to any com
munity and northern Berkshire sports
men are indeed fortunate in having
Mr. Nichols to protect their interests
and to enforce those laws which make
for better sportsmanship, better hunt
ing and tlslilng and hotter conditions
for the birds and game and fish that
have no other protector. I
"Mr. Nichols has time and ,agaiu
proven that he is the right man in tho
right place. He knows the laws, hav'
Ing grown with them in their making,
und ho enforces them as they should
be enforced.
"Northern Berkshire Is properly pro
tooted and always will be properly
protected as long as Atthur M. Nichols
Is game warden.

SILVER KING CAPTURED '
Long Sought Leader of Wild Horse
Hrd in Idaho
The New York Herald of Sunday
contained the following:
"Pancho Villa is still free, but Silver
King, long sought leader of the great
herd of wild horses of Idaho, has
been captured. The fact was an
nounced yesterday by W. E. Hawks,
owner of the Two Bar 70 Ranch, on
Snake River, Idaho. Silver King's
stock by some persons is said to date
back to the days of the Spanish con
quest and Pizzaro's flight from Mexico.
His cunning, speed and endurance
have made him as famous in the South
west as Villa is in Mexico.
"The reason for this interest in Sil
ver King is that Mr. Hawks was com
missioned several years ago by Guy
Weadick, director general of the
Stampede, a big cowboy and festival
contest for the world's championships
which will be held in Sheepshead Bay
next August, to get the stallion.
This affair will be held under the
patronage of wealthy sportsmen. Sil
ver King was, discovered with several
other fine horses and was caught by
Indians led by Chief High Moon. Sil
ver King will be shipped to this city
with three hundred other horses.''
"IN OLD VERMONT" REPEATED
Second Performance of Local Play Re
peated Last Evening
The second performance of Dorothy
Canfield Fisher's local play "In Old
Vermont" was put on in Library hall
last evening to an audience w-hlch once
more filled the house. The cast was
piacticaliy the same as the first pro
duction with the exception of the part
played by Paul C. Howe, who was un
able to give the recitation "Ho To the
Borders" on account of illness.
The second rendition passed off
smoother than the first because the no
table actors and actresses present had
become acclimated to the flash of foot
lights. Among the good work done by indi
vidual members of the cast was that
of Judge Bennett and Mrs. L. H. Ross;
Laurence Griswold's description of the
Battle of Bennington; Dean Martin as
a soloist rendering the stirring strains
of Yankee Doodle; G. Phil Endress,
Mrs. W. H. Wills; E. E. Bottum and
others. .
A gocd slzed sum considerable over
$50 was netted from the second per
formance. INCORPORATION FAILED
Electric Light Proposal for Village of
South Shaftsbury Rejected.
The proposal to incorporate the
village of South Shaftsbury for the
purpose of installing electric lights
was lost at a meeting held in that
village Tuesday evening by the close
vote of 47 to 44.
There were not many arguments ad
vanced on either side and the meet

faction to all in attendance.
CANAL UNDER MOUNTAIN
New Waterbury Links Marseilles with
Interior of France
The canal under he mountain be
tween Marseilles and the River Rhone,
constituting one of the most notable
engineering achievements of modern
times, was officially opened Sunday in
the presence of a distinguished gather
ing of members of the cabinet and oth
er officials, including Marcel Sembat.
minister of public works; Etienne
Clejnentel, minister of commerce, and
Joseph Thierry, under secretary of
wa.
Hitherto Marseilles, although a great
port of entry for the Mediterranean,
has been walled in from Central
France by a mountainous ridge that
sweeps around the northern side of the
city. The canal is chiefly remarkable
in that it pierces this barrier, the wat
erway running for five miles in a tun
nel under a mountain. It thus has tho
effect of linking Marseilles with inland
cities such as Lyons, Avignon, and Val
ence, and putting it in touch with the
extensive inland commerce along the
River Rhone, it will also give Mar
seilles a direct water connection with
Harve and the North Sea.
That an engineering work of such
magnitude should have been carried to
completion when France is in tho
throes of a war Is considered a tribute
to the stability of her enterprise.
The canal and its tunnel have been
under discussion for nearly 100 years,
but actual work on them was not be
gun until 19U4. The length of the can
al Is sixty miles, and the five-mile sec
tion under the mountain Is seventy-five
feet wide and seventy feet high, con
stituting what is declared to be the
largest tunnel interior in tho. world.
Barges and vessels up to 600 tons can
navigate tho canal, which, like the
Kiel canal, it is believed, will have
strategic value In permitting the move
ment of destroyers and small warcraft
between the Mediterranean and the
North Sea. The cost, of th6 work has
been about 100,000,000 francs.

Paris Says German Bombardment
FRENCH TRENCHES C1PTURED
German Headquarters States Attempts
to Retake Lost Ground Were
Repulsed with Heavy Loss.
Paris, May 10. A slackening of tho
German bombardment northwest of
Verdun is reported by the war office
today. The French are reported to
have halted a German attack on hill

trenches during the night
Berlin, May 9, (by Wireless to Say

In connection with our successes at
Hill 304 we took, south of Termlten
Hill, to the south of Haucourt, sev
eral trenches by storm. Attempts by
the enemy to recapture with strong
forces the terrain lost on Hill 304
failed. The enemy's losses were
heavy.
Other attacks by the French on the
east bank of the Meuse, in the district
of Thiaumont farm, were equally un
successful. The number of French
