BOY OF FOURTEEN
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT
Philip Lohri in Burbank Found
Dead From Gun Shot
Wound.
A most distressing fatal shooting
accident took place last Thursday in
Burbank township, when Philip Will
iam Lohn, fourteen-} ear old son of
Amund and Anne Lohn, accidentally
shot himself when out trying to shoot
crows.
The boy left in the morning and the
parents took no notice of his absence
until in the evening, as they assumed
that he had gone to school. When he
did not return in the evening, a hunt
was made and his body was found
with the head frightfully mangled
from a charge from the gun It is as
sumed that the boy had dragged the
gun behind him when the hammer
was struck in some way and the load
discharged. The lad had discovered
on his trip to school a place wheie
crows were nesting and had made up
his mind to shoot them and therefore
took the gun with him that fatal morn
ing
Coroner Branton was summoned
and arrived on the scene the same
evening.
The deceased boy was born April
2, 1902, in Burbank township. He was
attending parochial school at the Crow
River church He is mourned by his
parents, three sisters—Mabel, Minnie
and Laila and four brothers—Oscar,
Silas, Burton and Eddy.
The funeral occurred Saturday,
Rev T. O. Tolo officiating, and the
interment took place at the Crow
River church cemetery The grief
stricken family has the sincere sym
pathy of the entire community in this
dark hour of trial

INTERESTING LETTER FROM
WOODMEN SANITORIUM
Facts Concerning One of the Finest
Institutions of Its Kind In
the World.
A prominent Woodman of this
county is sojourning at the Woodmen
Sanitonum, in Colorado, and the fol
lowing extracts from a recent letter
to the Willmar Tribune, will no doubt,
be read with interest by the many
Woodmen of this county, who have
contributed towards establishing this
institution:
"This is one of the grandest insti
tutions of its kind in the country.
With the many improvements that are
now in progress fully completed, it
will be safe to say that the Sanitor
lum will rank with the very best in
the world. The service in all lines
is of the best that can be had and
everyone connected with the place is
so courteous and thoughtful of the
welfare of others that life here is a
pleasure for those who are so fortun
ate as not to be among the hopeless
cases under* treatment. In fact, there
are very few such here, and when a
hopeless case is discovered his stay
is not prolonged.
We are located 12 miles from Colo
rado Springs, but as we have a post
office here on the grounds my mail is
sent to Woodmen, Colo, which is the
name given this office at this inland
\own.' The mail comes out here from
the Springs twice a day by automo
bile. It is a 'stage* line, also carrying
passengers. With several hundred
people to serve—180 patients and a
large force of nurses, physicians, em
ployees, etc, we are given first class
service in all respects and the Wood
men post office does considerable
business during the year. Presume it
gets its name from the fact that there
are so many Woodmen here.
"A sunny disposition and implicit
trust in the better and higher things
of life are a good equipment to battle
this foe, which it seems has laid its
'claim' upon so many. Ever looking
upward and living 'on top', as the
common expression goes.
"The cure here, speaking from a
material standpoint, is not what might
be termed a permanent one, but it is
certainly a very good starter for one
who is determined to continue caring
for himself with the rules and instruc
tions laid down here to follow out.
Again I say it is a grand institution
and all Woodmen ought to feel proud
of it.
"Each patient has his own little
cottage, which is steam heated and
electric lighted and otherwise equip
ped in the most modern way. I for
one have no complaint to make, for I
have been treated most royally here
both by the 'powers that be' and those
in their employ. We patients are all
like one family of 'boys' grown-up
'boys', who are bound together in a
most fraternal spirit. This is where
the true brotherhood is exemplified.
There is no distinction here, and we
have all callings and professions rep
resented. Illness makes us all alike
and we are together for one common
purpose. An enforced rest of this

BIG CO-OPERATIVE
PACKING PLANT
President Chryst Tells Fanners
About This Largest Of
Enterprises.
Ira M. J. Chryst, a national figure
in the farmers' co-operative move
ment, four years national president
of the Society of Equity, and president
of the largest co-operative enterprise
ever launched in the Northwest, a
million dollar terminal packing plant,
now being established at South St.
Paul, addressed a representative gath
ering of farmers in the schoolhouse in
Disk 48 last Saturday evening. By
special invitation representatives of
the press of Willmar were present.
Mr. Chryst, owner of the Fairview
farm, on R. F. D. No. 1, Hudson, Wis.,
has a pleasing personality, is fair and
reasonable in his utterances, and
knows the co-operative movement
from a to z. He is a good speaker
and he held the floor Saturday eve
ning for two hours, with his listen
ers interested thruout.
In his introductory remarks, Mr
Chryst showed the great need of the
farmers taking more decided interest
in the marketing of their products
He quoted Government statistics to
show that the consumers in some in
stances pay as high as eight times the
amount paid the producers for pro
ducts. He quoted the report of the
Country Life Commission, a body of
men who began their investigation of
the "high cost of living" with the idea
that the principal cause was the
somewhat higher prices received by
farmers, to the effect that there ex
isted "too many unnecessary toll
gates" which the farmer's products
must pass before they reached the ul
timate consumer. Mr. Chryst denied
that the purpose of the Equity Society
was to place added taxes to the con*
sumer. They recognize that the in
terests of the consumer are vital to
the welfare of the producer. The ob
ject of the farmers' co-operative en
terprises as to do away with "the un
necessary tollgates" for the benefit of
both producer and consumer.
The speaker had no quarrel with
members of the Chambers of Com
merce or owners of packing plants as
individuals. They had provided the
necessary marketing facilities which
the farmers had neglected or so far
have been unable to provide for
themselves, and were simply taking
advantage of the situation as they
found it.
Mr. Chryst next discussed the grain
markets showing how they were
manipulated by those in control to
the detriment of the farmer as well
as the consumer. He quoted figures
from reports filed with the Railroad
& Warehouse Commission showing
how the terminal elevators were re
ceiving little or no No. 1 hard wheat,
but were shipping out thousands of
bushels of such grade. How they re
ceived immense quantities of No. 4,
no grade, and rejected grain but had
none to ship, it apparently all ending
its way out improved in grade. Far*
mers have established co-operative
elevators all over the Northwest to
correct the local markets, and now
the next logical step was to establish
co-operative terminal elevators to cor
rect abuses at the big markets.
But the main subject of Mr. Chryst's
address was the stock markets. He
gave a graphic analysis of the method
used to hold down the prices to the
stock raisers at the stock yards, us
ing a return report blank of the local
shipping association as a text. South
St. Paul, Sioux City, Omaha, Kansas
City and other markets are but tribu
tary to Chicago, a good safe margin
being maintained to enable the oper
ators to re-ship surplus stock to Chi
cago at a profit. The capacity of the
Swift packing plant at South St. Paul
is often times less than one-fourth of
the receipts. Buyers never act at St.
Paul, before receiving the ruling pric
es of the day at Chicago.
The co-operative packing plant is
no longer an experiment. Wisconsin
has several, in the erection of which
Mr. Chryst has been active. Their
capitalization range from $250,000 to
$500,000. They supply local require
ments, but their operation has given
the co-operators many valuable les
sons which have encouraged them to
undertake this greater enterprise.
The new St. Paul packing plant is
capitalized at $1,000,000. It is incor
porated under the Wisconsin law, be
cause the "wise" legislators of Min
nesota saw a "danger" in permitting
co-operative enterprises of large cap
italization. The Wisconsin! law is
truly co-operative. It recognizes the
individual as the unit instead of the
dollar. No stockholder is permitted
to hold more than $1,000 in stock and
no stockholder has more than one
vote. The company has acquired one
hundred and sixty acres on the Mis*
sissippi river opposite the Swift
plant. It is reached by the main lines
of the Burlington, Milwaukee and
Northwestern railways, and the
switching charges from other roads
has been fixed the same as for the
Swift plant. The first block of $200,
000 in stock has been taken by the
farmers and the sale of stock is pro
gressing rapidly. The organization
expense is taken care of by charg
ing a premium for the stock, it now
being sold at $105, and this will be in
creased when the second block of
$200,000 is subscribed. The maximum
dividend to be paid is eight per cent.
The articles provide for a deduction
from receipts for a surplus fund un
til the same reaches one-third of the
capitalization. Any earnings beyond
that will be returned to the men who
sold the stock thru their local ship
ping associations. The organization
of local shipping associations through
out the Northwest was a necessary
preliminary step to the larger project.
Those associations will insure that the
new plant will secure the stock ne
cessary and their operation has been
educational among the farmers.
Mr. Chryst was heartily applauded
at the close of his remarks, the lat-
ional
It is expected that a more general
meeting will be arranged for at Will
mar in the near future, which Mr.
Chryst will be .invited to address.

What the Engineers are Doing
IHIRTY thousand American engineers are
making a card index survey of American in
dustry so that it may be prepared for its vital
part in defending the Country, if need comes.
The past eighteen months have taught us here in
America what lack of industrial preparedness has meant
to some of the countries now at war. These nations
had the ships and they had the men but when the hour
struck, their factories were not able to furnish the colors
with arms and shells and powder. Their factories were
not prepared. And our factories are not prepared.
But it not enough to draw a choral. In the United States five
great Engineering Societies Civil, Mining, Mechanical, Electrical
and Chemical—have pledged their services to the Government of the
United States, and are already working hand in hand with the Govern
ment to prepare industry for the national defense. They receive no
pay and will accept no pay. All they seek is opportunity to serve their
country, that she may have her industries mobilized for defense.
All elements of the nation's life the manufacturers, the business
men, and the workingmen—should support this patriotic and demo
cratic work of the engineers, and assist them cheerfully when asked
There can be no better national insurance against war.
It is euatomary for the differ
ent municipalities to designate
one Sunday in every year as a
"Go to Church Sunday." I there
fore designate next Sunday,
May 14, as an appropriate Sun
day for every one to attend their
respective churches out of re
spect to the Motherhood of our
country.
The Associated Advertising Clubs of the World, representing
all advertising interests have offered their free and heartyservice to the
President of the United States, in close co-operation with these five
Engineering Societies, to the end that the Country may know what the
Engineers are doing. The President has accepted the offer. The
Engineers have welcomed the co-operation.
This advertisement, published without cost to the United States, is
the first in a -nation-wide series to call the country to the duty of co
operating promptly and fully with the Engineers.

The ladies have felt repaid for the
efforts they have made and the in
terest taken in the cemetery and will
continue the work this year. They
earnestly hope for the hearty co-op
eration of all the people who own lots
in tip cemetery and care to have
SaikeTcept in an attractive way. Mr.
O. Rasmusson was appointed care
taker of the cemetery and has al
ready commenced work. The price
of the care of the lots will be from
$1.50 to $2.00 according to size of lots.
This money can be paid to Mr. Ras
musson to any any one of the follow
ing committees: Mesdames L. Rod
lun, Andrew Larson, A. Crosby, A. N.
Lewis, H. S. Peterson, Nellie Norin
and I. Cramer. Parties who desire to
clean and care for their own lots are
requested to remove all rubbish from
the grounds.
There will be an additional im
provement made this season in the
shape of a large flower bed, 20 feet in

CIVIC ACTIVITIES IN
WILLMARSCHOOLS
As Outlined By Superintendent
Foster in Report to
Government.
The following article was prepared
for the Bureau of Education at Wash
ington, as an outline of civic work
done in the grades of the Willmar
schools:
We have recently been asked if the
Willmar Public Schools offered a
course in civics in the elementary
grades. If civics in this connection
is to be defined as "The Science of
Civil Government," I must answer
no but if we are to understand civics
in a grade to mean the dynamics of
right conduct, I should answer yes.
We have no course, which covers more
than one month, which is spoken of
in connection with the word civics
but we have work which is regularly
outlined by the year, which is intend
ed to inform our grade boys and girls
regarding their civic environment in
such a way as to stimulate their nat
ural desire for action, and lead them
to grow into a civic consciousness.
Beginning with the first month of
the school year, some general topic
is given for study by aU of the grade
rooms of the system each month. For
instance
In the fall a County Fair with its
exhibits by young and old is taken for
September's work.
Following closely along this line of
work, fall flowers and vegetables are
taken for the month of October.
This, in turn, is followed with the
study of trees of the city just as they
are losing their leaves in the fall
and reported upon at the regular
teachers' and pupils' meeting in No
vember.
For later November and December,
story telling, relating especially to
the Pilgrims, Thanksgiving and
Christmas, is studied throughout the
system.
For the winter month of January,
great people of today, local, state, na
tional, and international are consid
ered with relation to the effect which
their life's work is having upon us.
February* the month of great birth
days, is devoted to storing the mind
with beautiful and appropriate mem
ory gems.
March and April are devoted to the
work of bulbs and what is especially
called civic helpfulness closing the
year's work in May with a final study
of birds.
These topics are given intensive
study by each grade room during the
month for which it is the special or
der of the day but is not wholly
dropped or confined to that month's
work alone. At the end of the period
of study the grade teachers, together
with several representatives from
each grade room, appear in the as
sembly room of the high school build
ing for a report of the month's work,
and a final discussion of what has
been done. In these discussions and
reports the pupils of all of the grades
take an active part. The representa
tives from each room outlining to the
rest of the audience in detail what
their room has done. These reports
and discussions include means of rec
ognizing, classifying, and growing
fruits, trees and vegetables, together
with comparisons and discussions of
varieties, adaptability to local condi
tions, and means of propagation. In
the story telling meeting, the children
from each room reproduce several
stories which they have learned dur
ing the month. Beside the content
of the story, considerable effort is ex
pended in preparing the pupils to be
able to stand before an audience and
deliver a message in an effective man
ner. This same end is carried out in
regard to memory gems in the month
of February.
One of the very interesting months
of the year, is the month of Janu
ary when the pupils are searching
their own minds, questioning their
parents and friends, and reviewing
the magazines in school, and library,
and home in order to become familiar
with the World's workers of today,
and with the work which they are
doing, and its effect upon the people
of the World, especially our own com
munity.
In March and April the thought is
more specifically—civic helpfulness,
and in this the pupils first study and
memorize a civic creed discuss prob
lems of local civic administration
and then organize into a Junior Civic
League or Civic Clubs in the various
rooms plan lines of effective civic
activity, which they endeavor to car
ry out. In this work they strive to
enlist the sympathies and co-operation
of other rooms in the buildings of the
system, the private property owners
in the city, the school board, com
mercial club, and city council. In
this connection the following activ
ities are among those which have
been undertaken by the pupils of the
Willmar schools this year:
One ward building organized two
teams of boys, during the winter
months, for the purpose of competing
with each other in keeping the walks
free of snow on two sides of the
school block. .These teams were
faithful to the undertaking, and after
every snowfall strove faithfully to
free the walks on their side of the
block before the other team could
clear the opposite side. This work
was conceived by the pupils, And the
idea was organized, and the work was
done through the initiative of the pu
pils. Following this good work thru
the winter the pupils decided that
they wanted a large flag for their
grounds. The school was organized
and each pupil of the building agreed
to earn whatever money he was able
to put into the fund, and that not one
cent should go into the fund which
was not earned by the pupil's own en
deavors. Lower grade pupils contrib
uted one penny or so each, while the
upper grades contributed ten cents.
A fund of fifteen dollars was secured
in this way and a flag for that amount
was purchased. It was then discov
ered that the flag pole upon the
school house was not adequate to the

RIN6UNG BROTHERS
CIRCUS IS COMING
July 22 Is Day Set fir Visit
to This City Of 'Urattst
Show Ofl Eartta."
It had seemed a foregone conclus
ion that a circus of more than ordl*
nary size was to visit this city, dur
ing the coming season, as Willmar
was omitted from the routing of the
Yankee-Robinson shows, which ex
hibited at many points in this vicin
ity, and thus the announcement made
the first of the week that Ringling
Brothers' circus, the biggest and best
of them all, will show here on July
22nd comes as no great surprise.
When Barnum and Bailey's circus
was here last summer, and the capac
ity of the big tent was taxed to the
limit, at the afternoon performance, a
crowd estimated at between fifteen
and twenty thousand persons, attend
ing, and about eight thousand more
at the evening performance, Willmar
was put on the circus map to stay.
Ringling Brothers have for many
years past been recognized as having
the greatest show of its kind, and it
is said to be better than ever this
year. With fair weather on Satur
day, July 22, the largest crowd which
ever gathered in this city will un
doubtedly be on hand to welcome this
"Greatest Show on Earth."
