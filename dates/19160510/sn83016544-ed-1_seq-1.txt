The Village Council is digging a
well in the alley adjoining the Tof­
tey & Co. steel garage building with
the intention of renting quarters in
the garage for the fire engine and
hose cart if the well proves suffi­
cient to supply the fire engine
which will pump 350 gallons per
minute. The well will be so situa­
ted that it will be possible to get
water without moving the engine at
all.
If it is successful it will prove of
great benefit to the entire business
section of the village in giving them
better fire protection. It should al­
so result in lower insurance rates for
the section of the village that can be
reached from the well.
