The house described by this -writer
is the old Cartwlght home at Glen
ville: One summer while visiting my
grandfather, my uncle took me to a
small village to visit my birthplace
I found it to be a large, -old-fashioned
frame house, setting back a. short dis
tance from the road, and presenting a
very forlorn, neglected appearance.
Standing guard over the" entrance
were two giant locust trees, nodding
and whispering together of -ihe ghosts
of the past. A stone walk: led up to a
small portico'that was overrun with
vines, while on either side, under the
iroijifeiS&indows, were remnants of for-
e)i1Jower beds. The front yard,
'Cotila- hardly be called a, lawn, was
grown over with crab grass and field
daisies, and one side had even develop
ed a blackberry patch. i
As I stood in the quiet summer aft
ernoon listening to the gentle' murmur
of the trees, and gazing uponithe scene
before me, all the memories of the
stories mother had told me of the past,
came crowding back upon me. Walk
ing slowly up the walk, I parted the
vines, and stepped upon the portico.
From here to the back of the house
ran a large hall. The scene from the
back door showed the ruins of the old
chimney, directly at the left, but be
yond that was an orchard, a beautiful,
peaceful orchard that rolled gently to
ward the creek in the distance
Walking around on the other side, I
found a gigantic sycamore tree, under
which mother had spent many a joyful
hour. Continuing my. walk,-1 stopped
under the locust trees, and gazing out
upon the hills beyond, tried to listen
to what the old family sentinels had
to tell me, and as I listened, my shoul
ders grew straighter, and my head
higher and I was glad proud that I
had been born a Kentuckian.

The pike from here to the Taylor

Three months ago if a person could
have looked into the future, telling
what old junk would be worth at this
time, he could have made a, great
many dollars by picking up old copper,
brass, zinc, gumshoes, etc, as it brings
good money per pound. This office
has sold forty dollars worth to Mr.
Sam Lewis that was considered worth
less. This does not include old type
and metal, as we knew that it had a
value.
Mr. Campbell Hutchison, who is a
