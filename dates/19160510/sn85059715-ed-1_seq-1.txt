ROBINSON GIVEN
SIGNAL OVATION
In Fayette County, Where He is
Making a Whirlwind Cam
paign of Three Days.
MOiNTGOMBRY, .May 10.?A nlgnnl
ovation from early morning until late
at night was the experience of Judge
Ira 13. Robinson in Fayette county
Tuesday where he began a whirlwind
three days' tour of the county begin
ning at Fayettelllle and concluding
with a great demonstration at night at
Montgomery.
In this great industrial county where
Judge Robinson's name is revered by
the laboring people for his known atti
tude of "fair deal" toward them as a
member of the supreme court of ap
peals. he was given a splendid demon
stration Tuesday of the loyalty of the
masses of the people toward him and
his reception exceeded the fondest an
ticipations of a Robinson manager's
county. At this place there was no
room large enough to hear the crowd
assembled to greet the Grafton jurist
and it was necessary to hold the meet
ing in the open. Judge Robinson was
in fine vim and spoke feelingly of the
inagnaminous reception which was ac-!
corded him. The local meeting was
presided over by Prof. A. S. Thorn and
Judge Robinson was introduced by
Mayor D. S. Hastings. He made a
dignified, able address expounding the
principals for which he stood and de
clared that his opponent was making j
his campaign through attempts to
prejudice the minds of the people of
the state against him because he was
receiving the support of the Republi
can state administration. Judge Rob
inson declared that ho was glad to be
a receipient of that support and was
now and he has always been unswerv-1
ing in his allegiance to the principles
of the Republican parties in both state
and nation. He further declared that
he wanted to try to continue the splen
did record of the Republican party in
West Virginia and not to tear down
its many valued accomplishments.
At the Fayette meeting earlier In the
day?Charles W. Dillon, former candi
date for governor and an ardent sup
porter of Judge Robinson, presided and
gave Judge Robinson a flattering in
troduction. On his way to Fayette
ville, Judge Robinson was met by an
escort of prominent citizens In twenty
five automobiles gaily decorated an*
was accompanied into the Fayette i
county seat with great acclaim. Judge
Robinson was highly pleased when he
learned of the Republican victory In |
the Second district and declared that
it Indicated a sweeping victory in the
state and nation next November. He I

noon and his trip will end tonight at

case of desertion, a husband leaving
a young wife less than 20 years old
with a sweet baby eleven months old
The young wife and mother heart
broken and sick appealed to the asso

diately taken up by the araoclaHpn.
An Investigation was made and It wns
found that the husband had left the
city for parts unknown and that the
r.other bad no friends or relatives to
rhom she might go.
A temporary home was found for
the mother and babe for a few days,
while the association were using its
cfTorts to run down the miscreant
husband, and to devise ways and
means to relieve the heartbroken aud
sick mother.
A good Christian family was found
that agred to care for the baby. In
the meantime the mother was placed
in a local hospital that she might
have a chance to recuperate. While
this is a sad case it is only one of
many like cases that the association

and acquitted himself like an old
campaigner. The mayor introduced
former Mayor L. C. Crlle, who made
