Expert from Factory Will Be Here
To Touch Them Off.
Fair Will Be Held July 3, 4 and 5
and Will Be a Hummer.
The Marshall County Fair to be
held July 3, 4, and 5, will be a blaze
of glory at night, as the fair man

of the largest manufacturer in this
country $400 worth of fireworks to
be touched off on the evenings of
the fair. Never before in the his
ovy of Marshall county has such a
magnificent display of fire-works
been seen as may be gazed on at
that time. To make sure that it
-"shall not be a fizzle, a man from
the factory will be here to fire the
explosives. Not even the battle of
Verdun where considerable fireworks
have been exploded, will be in it
with the Marshall county fair, and
don't you forget it.
Young Peoples Meeting in Mission
Church.
The Young Peoples society of the
Mission church in Warren held
their meeting Thursday evening,
May 4. It being a beautiful even
ing there was a good attendance.
The program committee had suc
ceded in getting some splendid num
bers for the evening. The meeting
opened with a song, bible reading
and prayer, and continued with
declamations, songs by the choir,
Reading, and a song by a quartet.
he subject debated was about the
rights of women as to speaking in
the church. The negative side will
have a chance to take it up at our
next meeting. Rev. Olson spoke
a while about the necesity of enter
ing upon the narrow way that leads
to eternal life, and about winning
comrades for Him who alone
can give this life. After the pro
gram refreshments were served.

turned to Warren, which, after dis
posing of their personal property,
they left about two months ago with
the idea of making their home some
where 'else. They went first to Illi
nois to visit with Mrs. Hirst's par
ents and after that they travelled
around considerably in said state and
in the states of Indiana, Ohio, West
Virginia and New York. At Buffa
bx N. Y., they crossed over to the
^Canadian side and looked over a
large part of the dominion, travel-
*jf* ling by rail and stopping off where
they wanted, finally arriving at Win
nipeg. There they turned south and
were soon back again in Warren, the
place that looks best to them after
all. Mr. Hirst says that in all their
travels ,they have not seen a farm
ing country that can compare at all
with the Red River Valley in Min
nesota. One who has farmed the
rich level prairie land here does not
like to go back to grubbing and
clearing land and picking stones on
steep hillsides in other states.

WARREN ORATORIO CHORUS
TO GIVE CONCERT
MONDAY, MAY 22.
The Warren Oratorio Chorus an
nounces a Sacred concert to be held
at the College on Monday evening,
May 22. The chorus consists of
some exceptional talent in the city
and promises to be one of the best
concerts ever rendered in the city.
The program will consist of selec
tions from West's Faith and Praise,
and from Handel's Messiah. Both
of these oratorios are so well known
to all our people, and such are their
merits that the name alone should
mean a packed house. Besides the
chorus work a number of solos will
be rendered from the above orator
ios. The soloists this year are Miss
X.illie Anderson, soprano, Miss Nora
Bakke, contralto, Mr. N. E. Bystrom,

that all desire to hear them. Miss
Hermanson will preside at the piano.

but we have no expenses to meet.

3 YEAR OLD CHILD LOST
PARENTS GRIEF STRICKEN.
One of the sadest affairs that has
ever happened in this county occur
red on Thursday afternoon of last
week when the three year old child
of Mr. and Mrs. James Winter, liv
ing on the old Higgens place six
miles east of Hallock, became lost
and has not yet been found. The
little one had been out of his
mother's sight only a few minutes
when all traces of him were lost.
Immediately an alarm was given and
the entire neighborhood turned out
to hunt for him, but up to going to
press last evening the search was
without result. The river, in its
flooded condition, flows near the
house, and it is now supposed that
the little fellow might have fallen in
and was drowned. The river was
dragged and searched for many
miles, but this was also without
avail. -The grief-stricken parents
are in a state of collapse as a result
of the sad occurence.

NOW WHERE WERE THEY?
Happy Hikers Have Early Breakfast
Out doors.
The morning winds wafted the
delicious odors of sizzling bacon,
browning eggs and crisping toast to
Warren's early risers on Tuesday
morning last. At first they thot
themselves, still, wrapped in dreams
of istBsfr pierced nights of the c&rap'
life and* the awakening in the spicy
woods to hear the crackling camp
fire and the sputtering bacon and
eggs, but second thot told them that
somewhere in the greening woods
the Happy Hikers were sitting
around the morning camp fire.
The breakfast committee of the
club: Delia, Sylvia and Ahaliba,
were missing on the hike, but when
the hikers were led to a glowing fire
and scented the delicious coffee, the
secretary at once cancelled the fines
and all the hikers were soon fitting
hot slices of bacon, dripping rich
ness, between newly crisped slices
of buttered toast. But how much or
how many, that the club won't tell.
Its one of the secrets.
The evening before was spent in
the transaction of weighty business,
we are told. A wee corner mouse
heard something about dress, hats,
and neck-ties, but the young ladies
say "just wait till we're ready some
morning". Perhaps the delicious
cakes and ice served by the president
and treasurer would not be counted
as business by outsiders, but the
Happy Hikers are sure that it is a
part of their business to find some
of the sweetness and joy of life
along the road.

Warroad, Minn., May 8.Four-
persons were burned to death and
five others seriously injured when
the- home of D. A. Inman, two and
one-half miles from here was com
pletely destroyed by fire at 2:30
Sunday morning.
The dead:
D. A. Inman, aged 58.
Mrs. Inman, his mother, aged 92.
Nancy Underkoffer, sister, aged
60.
George Inman, son, aged 20.
The injured: Mrs. Inman and
four children.
Mrs. Inman, mother of D. A. Ia
man, Mrs. Underkoffer, and George
Inman slept on the first floor
George on a cot in the living room,
and the two women in an adjoining
bedroom. The rest of the family
slept upstairs. The cry of .fire was
given by Mrs. Underkoffer. Mi-, and
Mrs. Inman and four children on the
second floor, all managed to fight

man carrying an 11-year old boy.
Upon reaching the outside door he
flung the boy out and turned intend
ing to enter and render assistance to
his aged mother, at the same time
calling to his wife to break open the
bedroom window from the outside.
This she did, burning and cutting
her hands in the act.
Inman Suffocated.
It is thought Mr. Inman was
quickly suffocated upon entering the
house as he failed to reappear and
repeated calls from Mrs. Inman, at
the window failed to bring a re
sponse. Later his charred remains
were found at the door where he
had appai'ently fallen out backward.
The four bodies were all burned be
yond recognition. The survivors,
Mi-s. Inman and four children, Lois,
age
18 da
12 Hallie, 11, and the
youngest a girl of 6, received medi
cal aid as soon as possible. While
they are severely burned and suffer
ing untold agonies, there is hopes of
their recovering. One of the young
er children as soon as she was safe
outside, ran to home of Howard In
man, a brother, living half a mile
away, but he reached the scene too
late to render any help.
The cause of the fire is unknown,
but there was an incubator in one
corner of the living rocn, and tl'e
supposition is that the dog had upset
the lighted lamp under it in ikmg
a bed 'for himself.
MOST FERTILE SECTION
OF THE UNITED STATES.
New Farm Manager on Polk County
Farm Praises the Red River
Valley.
"I believe this is the most fei*tile
section in the entire United States,"
was the statement of L. J. Nye,
formerly of Decatur, Illinois, but
now manager of the big Kiewel
stock farm near this city. Contin
uing Mr. Nye said, "I have travelled
from the east to the west and from
the north to the south, but never
have I found a place so ideal, wea
ther, soil, society and business all
considered."
Mr. Nye is a practical dairyman
as well as a college farmer. He has
taken a course in the agricultural
department of the University of
Illinois and followed this with prac
tical work on the farm. He speaks
enthusiastically of the future of the
dairying business in this section and
is especially well pleased with the
chance for development offered him
at the Kiewel farm.
The Kiewel farm is one of the fin
est and largest in this section
Over 600 acres on the home place
and a section for pasture and hay.
Not a spear of wheat is raised and
all the corn, rye, oats, alfalfa and
barley is consumed on the place.
Holstein and Shorthorn cattle are
kept in modern dairy barns and
milked by the latest thing in milking
machinery. Duroc Jersey hogs to
the number of 130 are now on the
place and it is expected to increase
this herd shortly. Four big silos
provide accomodation for the stow
ing away of 600 tons of ensilage for
winter use and all buildings are
warm, well lighted and ventilated.
Everything possible is done in the
way of keeping the place clean and
it is the aim and intention of both
Mr. Kiewel and Mr. Nye to make
this one of the show places of Polk
county, and at the same time prove
that money can be made from such
venture.Crookstoii Times.!"'
