She is broken in two just abreast
of the' bridge, and her forward holds
and bow can be seen many feet be
low the bridge and the after part of
the liner.
"The Chiyo's stern is in 30 feet of
water," said Capt. Dobson. "She ran
aground at the only place in miles
where there was shallow water and
anything like a beach. If she had
gone 40 feet to one side or the other,
she would have crumpled against the
rock cliffs and gone down in deep
water probably with great loss of
life." -

shows a tide race to exist exactly at

The senate sulM-omualttee on judiciary
will reopen the hearings on Friday
upon the nomination of Louis D. Bran
deis for a?sociate justice of the su
preme court The fight against him
is being waged bitterly.
The committee announces that it
will inquire into Brandeis' connection,
as an attorney, with the merger of
the United Cigars Stores, and the
Rlker-Hegeman chain of drug stores;
their product, was stated today, by
Christian J. Hedemann, manager of
the Honolulu Iron Works, who return
ed this morning on the China Mail
liner China, after passing four months
in the Orient and studying the Phil
ippine sugar industry carefully while
away.
"In the beginning. Philippine sugar
planters were a little reluctant to con
sider installing central grinding
plants," said Mr. Hedemann. ''How
ever, the centrals built at San Carlos
and Calamba have enabled them to
stop the old antiquated mills and dis
pose of their cane to the centrals.
-The Calamba central is now offer
ed far more cane than it can grind
with its present milling plant, and
this will be still more the case next
year. The principal reason for; the
centrals has been that with the, high
cost of transporting Philippine sugar
to New York, with freight rates up to
unprecedented figures. It does not pay
to export a low quality of sugar to the"
mainland. The sugar must be of a
higher grade and of a higher value to
