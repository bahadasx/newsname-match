Our Demoeiatic friends will
have a greater interest in the re
suit of the Progressive party
convention this year than in the
outcome of irither the otljer big
party gatherings.
Wo haven't "got" Villa jet,

Tho state offcoials refuse, to
let anyone see the present con
dition of the state treasjry.
We don't Maine 'tin, the present
condition of the treasury is trx
Kudo to be paraded with decency.
tlov. Major maintains that the'
state treasury is all right, Th
difficulty seems merely to b'
that there insn't inor.ey enough
in it for other things after tliv
families on tlie payroll Lave got
their's.
Martial law haw been de -lured

The Maxim Munitions Corpor
ation has haught the exclusive
manufacturing rights to r.
Khricht's gasoline substitute.
This means we'll have a fat
ohauoo of getting it cheap motor
fuel. Wo wonder bow far the
Standard Oil directorate over
laps that of the Maxim Corpora
tion Year I'nclo Hamual has
been aslep at the switch again.
The time for holding the grat
national party conventions Is
drawing near. What the Ik-mo-rrats
will 4o at their'a Is already
settled, so tho main interest of
the public will be ceatered ou
the Kepwblican convention nl
Chicago and Ivoosevelt. The
Progrtssivo party will meet t
Chicago on the saint date tha
lias bueii snlcoUd by the Repub
licans. There will be nothing to
the Progressive gathering but
Roosevelt. So far tha country
is still at sea as to the man the
Republicans will name lor presi
dent, except that it will not be
Koosevlt. That seems to bo
pretty wall settled by tha cow
plaxion af the Republican dele
gates already selected. The )hs
aibility tha; this convactiou will
be stampeded to tho Colonel is
too remato to be seriously enter
taiaed. Hut who is the man the
man the Republican can nomi
nate that the Colonel would en
dorse in his convent ion? That's
tho rub. The Colonel's conven
tion ta alaiply goiog to mark

approval on the Jodge. If the
Republican nominee don't suit
Colonel he wilt probably newi
nate himself on the Progressive
ticket. But maybe tbe Repnbll
canu cob gat along without him.
There iasomethiag wrong with
the "grandest prosperity the
C0l,ntry Las ever known" when
thot8aBd, upon tbounands of
wor.linginen go out on strikes
for better wages whllo that
"prosperity" prevails. The
wage earner thus announces that
he hasn't besa sharing in it so
far, and that hp is going to make
an effort to get it. The war in
Europe ha, boomed certain lines
of industry in this country and
great profits have been made for
the stockholders in thosi' indus
tries, bat labor has gained ooth-
ing from it. In fact, in spite fcf
the whge inerrasfs in some lines,
labor is roally worse off today
thiin it was before the war busi
ness boom began, for aloDjr with
this boom tho priee of pretty
nearly all the necessaries of life
has um gone a-boo-a ing. The
-0 or 'Ti er cunt wage advances
that Late been granted to some
of tite industrial workers has
been ir.ore than offset by the
rise ; the cost ot living. Our
growing list of multi-millionairps
lias grown richer from this pecu
liar brand of prosperity, herald
ed by the Democratic press ss
bearing the copyright label it
that party (not genuine without
the signature of Wood row Wilt!,
but the masses havo foandtheui-
selves growing cooier. Why
riaf tho joybelis jrilng tiding of
of a 10 per O'ut wage jjain when
tho bt-neficiarj- is held up
and i vlivd of it as jub as he
steps cut of his ilooi withtl.e;
market basket.' The "grand.,t
prosperity the country has ever
k nown." is a calamity to Ue mass
es, instead ef beneficence, under
such conditions.
The price of sugar kK-ep on
going np, tho small corsamer
now paying abost p.ieeats pennd
for ordinary grannlated, and
therfl is no indication in sight
that ha is going to get it ekoaper
very toon". Meanwhile he keeps
on aslting the cause cf this ad
vance. A circalsr letter (rata

worth of raw sugar (Cuban canet
was ooneeutrated ta New York.
te!d up there by order of the
S(j i"Oard refiners waiting for the

Hrewive that Demaeratle tariff
tinkering has directly affected
your pocketbooli in a way quite
the reverse from that promised
you ia tho Democratic platform.
There is (something else t be
gathered, freai this hold up of
raw sugar by the refiners, It
gives tb lie to the contention
that sagar prices havo been
forced ap by a alwrtage of sup
ply and the demand ia Bit rope.
There is enough illumination in
those facts to guide the Auieri-i-in
e-onsunier to the conviction
teat he is the victim of a strong
arm holdup, not ouly on bis su
gsr purchases alone, but ia
wvarything else he has to buy,
by tlm price fixing combinations

President Wilson sud the Demo
cratic congress shut their eyes
