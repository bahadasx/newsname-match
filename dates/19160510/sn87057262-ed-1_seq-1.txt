American Forces Along the Border
Numerically Superior to Mexican
Troops Under Obregon.
^By EJ. T. Conkle, United Press Staff
Cor respondent.
BIj PASO, Texas, May 10.—General
Bcott held the whip band today in
bit negotiations with War Minister
Obregon. For the first time the
American forces available for duty
along the border In Merico were
numerically superior to the Mexican
troops and military officials believed
Obregon's bluff has been called. An
other conference between the war
beads is expected today and author
ises confidently expected full agree
ment of details of the original plan.
While Scott obdurately refused to

General Funston underestimates the
I danger of an explosion which no
diplomatic action could repair. Obre
gon is understood to 'be directing mili
tary movements ln Chihoaboa state,
and both commanders are dispersing
to avert, if possible, a sudden clash
between Americans and Garranzlataa.
Cbregon lost no time seeking a con
ference, after President Wilson or
dered the Texas, Arizona and New
Qlexioo militia to the border. Juan
Amador, under secretary of foreign
relations, motored to EJ Paso soon
after the news was received in Juarez
and asked a resumption of the con
ferences on behalf of Obregon.
The meeting lasted two hours.
Obregon submitted a proposition for
the Americans to return to the border
and from their own soil co-operate
with an equal number of Carranzistas
In wiping out the bandits. Scott
promptly turned the proposition
down. When the meeting ended, the
conferees accepted Scott's invitation
to lunch in his private car and,
Parting, the men appeared entirely
friendly, promising resumption of
xiegotiations today.
American officials were confident
today that an agreement will be
reached, possibly in this afternoon's
meeting. The American attitude is
plain. Obregon knows what Scott
*ill concede.
In view of these facts, military
authorities could foresee but one
outcome if the negotiations continue,
namely, an agreement granting the
points the Americans have con
tended for.

The situation as outlined reliably
to the United Press is this:
This government had supposed the
ScottObregon agreement practically
ln effect and that Carranza would
approve it in as much as it was con
tracted by his chief military officer.
Border raids occurred In the mean
time. These had to be oftecked. More
over, there are evidences of manipu
lation of such actives from th^
American side. For this reason,
these additional troops were sent.
Stripping the eleven coast artilery
companies from Galveston to Dela
ware and sending the field artillery
from Fort Sill, Okla.. was discussed
yesterday, but not actually deter
mined until nearly midnight last
•night.
The effect of moving fresh forces
to the boundary will be according
to the administration view:
Prevention of border raids.
Possibly persuasion of Obregon to
give up his time limit demands and
to stand on the agreement made sev
eral days ago.
Stopping of plotting on the Ameri
can side.
Possibility that the additional
troops would inflame the Mexicans is
discounted by officials. They think,
to the contrary, that it will quell any
post trouble.
As for intervention, the administra
tion believes these very steps are
preventing it and while taking a
grave view of the situation tempor
arily, officials told the United Press
that they are optimistic as to the fu
ture.

BERLIN, (via wireless to 8ayville)
May 10.—More than a million men
are now engaged on both aides 'n the
renewal of heavy fighting around khe
fortress of Verdun, it was semi-offi
cially stated here today.
"While it is generally, considered
that the attacking forces must be four
times' superior to the defending, the
German troops really number- less
than one-half the French forcea en
gaged, which are not lesa than 800,
000," said the statement. "These fig
ures represent half of the entire
force which France still has at her
disposal for active fighting.
"The second German attack against
Verdun is based on the crushing ef
fect of heavy German artillery. The
taking of small western fortresses at
the beginning of the war by heavy
artillery was only a prelude to the
artillery results being attained today.
At any rate the French have been un
able to compete with German artil
lery and ammunition. The enormous
French losses are due partly to the
affect of German artillery and partly
to the tenacity of the French who
will not abandon their trenches."
Major Morant, German military
critic, pointed out today that all the
German aucceases on the east and
west front were gained against enemy
forces numerically superior and that
the Austrians, for a year, have held
back an Italian force twice as strong
numerically."

Frost also confirmed the statement
that there were no Americans aboard
the Cymric and that she was not
armed.
It was authoritatively stated todav
that the Cymric was not in admiralty
service. As an ordinary merchantman
she was entitled to all the immuni
ties granted by Germany in her
pledges to the United States in the
reply to the American note. Special
despatches all agree that the Cymric
did not attempt to escape.
Captain Beadnell was quoted as
saying that the Cymric was torpedoed
without, warning and that no subma
rine was seen though several of the
crew saw the wake of the torpedo.
One or two officers, however, declared
they saw a submarine which sub
merged just before a torpedo crashed
through the engine room, killing four
men outright. A fifth was drowned in
