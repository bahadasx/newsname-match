ROBBERS TAKE
JITNEOR'S CASH
BY AID OF GUN
James Clifford Held Up and
Taken to Lonely Spot Near
Greens Farms. ,
Forced, with a gun, to drive from
Greens Farms to this city after he
had been relieved of what money he
had, James Clifford, 'a young jitney
driver, residing at 818 Lafayette street,
had an adventure last night. Clifford
was piloting his own car along State
street about 10 o'clock last night when
at Hancock avenue, two men stepped
to the machine and asked him - how
much he would charge to drive them
to South Norwalk. A price was agreed
upon! andv a start made toward the
designated town. Clifford became
suspicious when he " noticed that the
two men in the back seat did not talk
at all, but he kept driving.
When a wooded section of the road
was reached near Greens Farms, a
gun was suddenly, poked to. the young
V an's head ' and he was commanded
to hand over all his money to the
men. He had only six dollars with
him, which they took. : He was then
told to drive toward Bridgeport, and
with the gun constantly, behind him,
the trip was made to this city. At
State street the men got out of the
car after first 'warning him not to
breathe a word of the occurrence to
anyone. According to Clifford, the
men are American-born, and are per

Stratford Native, Accused of
Embezzlement in Ansonia,
Is Given Three to Ten
Years Sentence.
Pleads Guilty t to Five
Counts, Two Being Omit
ted Had Recently Been
Employed in Bridgeport.
New Haven, Feb. 11 Frank
lin G. Burton, former treasurer
of the Savings Bank of Ansonia,
was sentenced to not less than
three years nor more than 10
years in state prison, by Judge
Jqel Reed of the superior court
today, after pleading guilty to
embezzlement of funds, forger
ies of notes and mortgages and
making false: entries on the
bank's book lo deceive the bank
commissioner and 'fee officers
of the bank.
Burton took the sentence
without any outward show of
emotion.-
The imposition of sentence was pre
ceded by presentation of the state's
case hjj State's Attorney Haines, of
Middlesex ' county;- a reply by. Mr.
Holden, of Ansonia, attorney' for the
defendant, who also made a plea for
clemency, and a review of the crime
by Judge Reed, who referring feel
ingly to the painful position he was
in in being obliged to impose penalty
upon one whom in, years past he -had
personally known as a friend and a
man for whom he had had the high
est regard.
Burton ; -was arraigned on seven
counts but Mr. Haines, explaining that
two covered incidents specifically re
ferred to in - the others, struck them
out;, with- the court's -permission.' One.
the third count, Mr. Haines said, was
greatly involved. The seventh one
was to have "been one covering all
Others. , . V
The information as read by the
clerk charged as follows: First, that
on Sept. 30, 1911, Burton took $7,008
tnr-nioneyfrom the bank; second, th-t
on May 1, 1914, he used a certificate,
later described as an interest pay
ment on an obligation held by tho
bank, sent by the city of New York
for $700; fourth,' that on Sept. 16,
1915, he took $4,300 cash; fifth, that
Sept. 1 1915, he took $7,253 in cash;
sixth, that on May 1, 1915, he 'made
false entries on the books concerning
certain notes, mortgages, etc., to the
amdUnt of $35,300' with intent to de
ceive the : bank commissioner and the
bank's officers.
Burton, called .pb the bar,, pleaded
guilty. Mr. Haines then related the
circumstances,, 'during which he
showed how Burton's acts were .re
vealed. This was under the fourth
count. He had taken $4,300 from the
till. The - bank commissioner was
making an examination. The count
ing of cash had been done in the
evening. ' " The ' clerk counting - had
found a slip of paper calling for
$4,300 cash which was supposed to be
in a tin box in the vault. . The next
day the clerk' wanted to see the tin
box. - When it was taken out the
$4,300 was not there.
Burton then confessed his short
ages. ..... x
Mr. Haines prefaced his remarks'
with an expression of the painf ulness
of the duty before him. The accused,
he said, had been, regarded as an up
right, respected citizen until Sept. JL6,
last, when his misdoings stood re
vealed. He had been upright in all
his acts in the eyes of the law, hon
ored by citizens of his town, had
twice , held the highest office; in the
gift of ! his fellow townsmen, repre-'
sented his district in the Senate and
as a bank officer and church member
had been a model citizen. His bank
connections extended through 25 years.
His peculations -began many years
ago, so , far back that it " is impossible
to determine when they? began.
Mr. Haines explained each count.
The first theft of $7,000 was made by
taking bonds entrusted to his carej,
placing them in the bank's assets and
using the equivalent in cash. The
bank makes no claim to title to these
bonds. The $600 taken was ah interest
draft. The $4,300 was cash taken to
use ' in an outside transaction and it
was covered toy use of a slip purport
ing to show the equivalent of cash in
the vault. The theft of $7,253 did not
at first appear, but 'Mr. Haines said
it was found that for many , years
there had been an overdraft. In the
stealing of $34,300 shown by false en
tries; Mr, Haines ; said the system of
forgery was as clever as any he had
seen during his twelve years' service
as a state's attorney. The bank ac
cepted notes for money loaned with
mortgages as security. Many of these
were copied ex active the notes and the
mortgages with the endorsement of
town clerks on the cover being accu
rately made.
In course of time the original notes
were paid and mortgages discharged
but Burton placed the copies he had
made in the bank's assets and took
the equivalent i cash for his own use.
Mr. Haines asked what punishment
should be given for- these acts. He
said that a sneak thief who steals a
woman's purse on the street corner is
Justly condemned. One person only
suffers loss, however, and only in les
ser degree is it an offense against so
ciety. A bank treasurer is custodian
of trust funds; he -deals with thou
sands; he protects the life savings of
rhe young and old"; men, women and
children. The state must deal with
things as they are, without sympathy
and without antipathy.
Mr. Holden made a plea for Burton,
saying that Mr. Haines' statement of
the case was fair except in regard tn
forgery of town clerks' endorsement.

ADOPT MID-YEAR
EXAMINATIONS IN
SCHOOL SYSTEM
Board of Education Admits
Students to High School -In
February.
S. P. WILLIAMS TO
HEAD HIGH GRADES
Prospect School Principal
Will Be Placed in Charge
At Old High School.
F"or the first time in the history of
the school system in Bridgeport, mid-school-year
examinations are being al
lowed1 for graduation from the grade
schools to the High school.
Most, of the examinations were given
in the grade schools Monday of last
week, and more are being held this
week. Some of the parochial school
children are, taking them today in
Franklin, school. ...
' About 30 pupils will be admitted
now to the High school under the new
IjBystem. They will enter the freshman
class and. if they advance yearby year
they will have saved four months at
the time of their graduation.
According to ..Superintendent Sam
uel J. Slawson there are many ad
vantages in the new system. Time
will be saved, congestion will . be les
sened, pupils who litherto have been
dropped in the February of their first
year will . have another half year in
which , to make good,, and opportunity
for rapid advancement is greater.
"The entering class in- February, at
no time will be more than 75 or 80
per cent. . the numbers of the June
class," said Superintendent Slawson to
day. j
. "We gave the examinations at the
call of the principals, but most were
held Monday of last week. Some of
the parochial children have expressed
a desire to adopt the system and we
are giving some examinations today
to pupils of those schools in the
Franklin school'
Mr. Slawson announced today that"
S. P. Williams,' principal of Prospect
street school, will be principal of the
old high school building, while .the
Eighth and Seventh, grades are there.
His salary will remain the same, it is
said.- ' .
','Mr. Williams will divide his time
betweenhis school and the old High
school," said Mr. Slawson.
"Someone called my attention to a
rumor that Miss Fannie A. Hurley,
supervisor of the grade schools, was
to be given another position, and her
place was to be taken by Mr Scliaffer.
That is absolutely what we, will not do.
"Miss Hurley will stay where she
is. We are looking for a man to take
charge . of the old High school when
the pre-vocational work is"' begun.
We want the best man in the country
in that line of work, if, we can get
him." , ' ' .

MURDER CASE
WITNESS LIED,
HE CONFESSES
. ... -. .. . -
Admission in Bridgeport
Lawyer's Office May Save '
, Williams' Life.
That Norman Morey, one of the
important witnesses in the Williams
Roe trial for murder, came- to Bridge
port Dec. 23, and in the office of
Charles ' H. Shapiro; Meigs building,
confessed that his testimony had been
untrue, is the allegation on which a
claim for a new trial is based. -
Isaac Williams, who lived on Gil
bert street, this- city, and Harry Roe,
of Poughkeepsie, have been convicted
of the murder of County Commis
sioner Hubert Case of Barkhamstead.
Asserting that Morey admits his
statements were false, Attorney Shap
iro, of .counsel for Williams," is de
manding a new hearing.
A hearing on the state's demurrer
was held yesterday, before Judge
Howard J. jurtis.
Attorney Bernard Higgins, of coun
sel for the defendants, told of the
meeting in the Bridgeport office.
Morey) went there voluntarily and
unsolicited and made the statement,
saying that his testimony in court !to
the burning of Williams' letters was
untrue; that they were at his sister's
in New Milford. Morey said ha could
tell a lot of things about Wifliams;
that he was willing to go before Gov
ornor Holcomb or a judge of the su
perior court and tell them, and that
was all he would do.
Mr. Higgins said he made no hesi
tancy in saying that he believed that
the statements made by Morey in
Litchfield and in Bridgeport were lies.
The question was, was that testimony
material? And did it turn the opin
ion of the jury?
'No human being can tell, said Mr.
Higgins whether the withdrawal of
the testimony of one witness would
have affected the verdict. He did not
know what effect it did have, but he
believed the result of the trial might
have been different. One of te
state's own witnesses, continued Mr.
Higgins, contradicts his own tesWjjpony
a id we say that his testimony was
material.
, If a new trial is granted it must be
rranted in favor of one as lTnuch as
the other, as they were tried together.
"Having heard Morey's statement,
counsel for the defense were forced to
make the application for a new trial.

, Inadequacy of the facilities provided by the New Haven)
road t& handle the constantly increasing volume of shipments in !
Bridgeport became more apparent than ever today in the lodal !
freight sheds. ' ,
That there is not enough help to unload the freight ship- i
ments on the big freighters running between New York and!
Bridgeport and that as, a result a shipment of many tons of I
copper, lost for several days, has been left on the ship for many!
trips were among the revelations of an-investigation at the i
kfreight yards and docks here today. , . '
The Fall River and the Maine, big freight steamers, have j
taken the place of the steamer Na'wgatuck. These boats on their'
trips to Bridgeport last night brought a total tonnage of 1,042, .
and railroad men said today that the greatest tonnage for one
day's shipments into Bridgeport, prior to yesterday, was 528.
Today the ,two ships went back to New York, with only ,
parts of their cargoes removed.; But it is not o unusual as to ;
command special attention. The condition vhas become. so hope- ;
less that the return of shipments for several trips has not caused "
any great commotion in railroad circles. v . ,, ' ,
The great growth in shipments of freight here and the in- .

Nestor E. Wedge, freight agent of,
thl taSlP line' free'y admitted
the fact that the doclc was overcrowd -

Special s Agent JRobert Teller, both
were engaged in seeing that no frieght !

Of freight here," said Mr. Wedge, "but I
it is not just that we are criticized for "
the fact. We are. in fact, the sav
ours of Bridgeport and I mean this !
JE- 2 I10 aPPJication of the wbrds

applies. These carload lots cannot
mov over the railroads. Our com-
pany has heretofore accepied ship
ments, across the city of New York by
truck without question as to previous
destination . of the goods. We v art
bringing it here-and throwing it upon
the docks as a favor to manufacturers,
crowded beyond anything ever record
ed in this city' ourselves.
"Blame is then put upon us for
freight congestion, which is partly due
to truckers and factories after we (
have got goods here that in themselves j
are of little intrinsic value, yeti mean j
thousands of dollars to Bridgeporters i
in the embargo emergency. ;
"See-those wheels there,'' said Mr.!
Wedge, pointing to a pile of cast iron, i
"Those came in day before yesterday. :
The truckman was notified yesterday ;
morning of their arrival. The factory ;
wants them, but because we have a :
line of cars that cannot be taken from ;
the doorways until loaded the truck
man refuses, with our help, to take
them through the doorway of a car
and put them on his truck. That is
the thanks we get for aiding the man
ufacturer." Special Agent Teller later disclosed
the fact that the old Naugatuck dock
was being placed in shape to receive
steamers and from other official
sources it was learned that the Inter
state Commerce commission had been
asked to permit the boat lines in con
junction with the New Tork, New IT a- "
ven & Hartford railroad to be con
tinued that Bridgeport might be the
big terminal for trans-shipment of
transcontinental goods to and from "
New "Fork. "Our aim is to make this
point the terminal of the Naugatuck
valley as it once was," said another
official whose name he did not wish
disclosed." It has again been found
that emergency mimes boat lines to
New "Fork an absolute necessity to
New England and- Bridgeport is the
only city along the coast available for
that purpose. I believe Bridgeport
will be one of the greatest freight ex
changes and terminals of the country
before a decade has passed. I pre
dict that within a year the. entire wa
terfront will be lined with freight
docks of the New Haven road- as far aa
the Ijocomobile plant."
