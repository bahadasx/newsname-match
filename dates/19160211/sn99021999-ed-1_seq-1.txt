SECRETARY OF
WAR QUITS AS
HIS PLAN FAILS
Garrison Hands in Resignation
When Wilson Refuses to Force
Continental Army Scheme
Through Conpress.
ACCEPTED BY THE PRESIDENT
Cabinet Official Also Opposed to
Giving Filipinos Inde
pendence. ALWAYS CLOSE TO HIS CHIEF
WASHINGTON.. Feb. 1 0. Llndley
M. Garrison, secretary of war, today
tendered his resignation to President
Wilson and it was accepted. Refusal
of the president to insist upon ac
ceptance of the continental army
plan, generally opposed In congress,
and Mrl Garrison's disapproval of
the Philippine Independence bill as
it passed the senate are understood
to have been responsible for his de
cision to quit the cabinet.
It was officially announced at the
White' House tonight at 8 o'clock
that Secretary Garrison's resignation
had been accepted by the president.
Reports of the resignation were circu
lated. Inte today after the secretary had
announced that ha would not deliver an
address on nntlonal defense before the
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States a had been expected.
Leaves for Sew lork.
Immediately afterward he and Mrs.
iarrlson left for New York and It was
said at the War department that It would
be for an Indefinite stay.
Peeretsry Garrtoon' objected strongly to
tne iarae amenomm,. .m.u, i..ii-u ...
tne rniuppme dim, providing iui ...un-
pcndence for the Islands within two to
four years. -
Tno president took the position that he
could not dictate details of an army plan
to congress. He conferred today with re-
publican members of the house military
committee, who Informed him thst demo
crats and republicans alike on the com
mittee were opposed to the contlnentsl
army scheme and that It had no chance
of being; approved. "Secretary Garrison
would not admit that there properly could
be modifications of the plan.
' The, president and Secretary Garrison
have hftn clone personal friends at
the administration came Jnto office and
. have Stood together on practically every
question.
President Wilson has supported the con-1
llnental army scheme and continues to
believe that It Ia the best plan for
strengthening the army. He hss msde It
Plain, however. In speeches and in talks
with congressional leaders, that the main
thing- Is to get a large reserve for the
United States army and that the details
must be worked out through "common
counsel.'"
I rare Toar of Coaalry,
Secretary Garrison hss been a leading

T
figure In President Wilson's official fam
ily ever since the administration began.
To his urging has boen ascribed in part
Mr. Wilson's determination to carry to
ihe country his plea for adequate na
tional defense.
Mr. Garrison began a close study of the
inilittary situation nearly two years ago.
Ha hss devoted days and nights to the
subject, beginning his inquiry,' he hss
himself declared, with only . a vague
knowledge of the military history of the
nation or of the problems presented In
planning for defense against any possible
enemy. ,
For months 1t has been a common
sight at the War department when he
was In the city to seo the lights In his
office biasing far into the night. Bur
rounded by his bureau chiefs and officers
on staff duty, the secretary went Into
every aspect of the case with all the con-
centratton he developed as a lawyer and
a member of the New Jersey judiciary.

Out of that study came the plan for the
continental army and co-related increases 1
in the regular army and proposals for
coast defenses snd a huge reserve of war

NOVEL QUESTIONS
IN PETROLITE CASE
Lansing Asks Austria About Taking
of Supplies from American Ship
by Submarine.
NOTE NOT IN FORM OF DEMAND
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10. Secre
...
UrJr Lansing announced today that
be had sent to the Austro-Hungar-
jan government, through Ambassa-
.. , . ,,
dor Pcnfleld. a dispatch asking for
an investigation and an explanation
o? the ttack by an Austrian sub
narlne on the American tank
steamer Petrollte.
The secretary said published state
ments that demands had been made
upon the. Vienna government were
4utiuty" buMbat. U.wa -within
iuc range 01 poHsioimy mat de
mands of aome sort might .be made
la the future should, the Investiga
tion and explanation asked for war
rant them. "
The secretary's dispatch called atten
tion to affidavits from members of the
crew of the Petrollte and to Information
from other source to the effect that the
ship was stopped In the Mediterranean,
near Alexandria, by an Austrian subma
rine, which fired upon It and wounded
one man in the engine room.
The submarine commander asked for
food, which Captain Thompson of the
Petrollte refused. He thereupon sent
boat din party, on the American ship
and removed one American member of
Its crew,, who was held as a hostage
while the Austrian took the food they
required from the Petrolite'a stores.
Novel questions are involved In the
esse. Warships under certain stress may
take food from merchantmen If they
give proper receipts or payment, but It
la realised that If submarines are to be
permitted to do so, every neutral ship
might be made a base for their opera
tions. x

Out Inut! western part of Wyom

Green River and Rock Springs, one
lone bandit, a man about 20 yeara
of age, smooth-faced, wearing a
soft black hat and a suit of light
colored clothes, boavded Union Pa
cific train No. if, the eastbound
Oregon and Washington limited,
gathered In $75 from six men, se
cured a nold watch, pulled the bell
cold, stopped the train, jumped off
and escaped.
The Oregon and Washington lim
ited pulled out of Green River at
9:30 Wednesday night and, as It was
leaving the station, a young man
swung himself up over the vestibule
rail of the observation far. He re
ir.alned on the platform until the
train was well out of the station and
entering the car was confronted by
M. Taylor, the rear brakeinan. Tay
lor asked him why he was there and
ws at once confronted by a revolver.
Without preliminaries, Taylor was
told to take off his cap, and at about
the same time the passengers In the
observation car were commanded to
shell out.
Keeping his revolver pointed hi the di
rection of the passengers, the bsndll
drove them Into the front end of the car
and ordered them to drop their cash and
watches Into Taylor's csp as they pssied.
They all responded without offering any
objections snd dropped one of thou,
giving up a gold watch.

Cleaning out the passengers (n the ob
servation car, the bandit ordered Taylor
into the sleeper ahead, following closely
behind. Entering the sleeper, the bandit
met Conductor Fltsgerald and linme
iliately appeared to lose his nerve. He
llred a couple of shots through the roof
c? the sleeper, reachsd up and pulled the
bell cora and as the train rsme to a stop,
backed out, ran through tho observation
car and dropped off the rear.
Reports to Union Pacific headquarters
