asked. '
"That, my friend, is a war secret.
Do you think a vessel with guns fore
and aft, with mines, torpedoes and
ammunition of many kinds on board,
could got by many enemy warships?
If you believe It Is possible to do that,
then I will say wo camo from Kiel.
We did not grow In the Atlantic
ocean. Wo did not find guns on tho
shores around the Canary Islands,
and what ammunition wo got off
captured ships would not have sunk
one of the, vessels we captured.:. v
"Wo were In tho Atlantic long-before
we sank the seven ships you
have heard of. You will hear of oth
er's that havo gone down from shells
fired by tho Moowo.
But don't you think tho British
flect will capture ana sinic lU0
Moewe?"
"They will not know her. Sho has
flown tho British flag anu passeu
British warships before. Sho has
.answered their signals. Sho has told
them thnt there were no uerman
-ships around. Sho can give any name
;she likes. She has no namo that they
can see.
"If tnoy chase ner It will bo a flno
-race. I would like to see It. She will
run them perhaps all the way to
America. She is so fast she could
have captured the Appam If we had
.advised Capt. Harrison ten miles
-away that we -were coming after him.
"We had the most excitement on
January 11, when we sighted the
Brjtish steamers Corbrldgo and Far
rlngford almost at tho samo time. Wo
decided to tako both shlpB at once,
. nnd wo started first for the Cor
brldgo. Wo signaled the vessel to
atop nnd fired at her. Wo went for
tho Farrlngford. Wo kept our for
ward guns trained on her and after
uns lm the Corbrldgo. Tho Corbrldgo
was nearer and we were sure of tak
ing her. Tho Farrlngford tried to
;get away, but wo ran her down
nbout 4 o'clock In the afternoon. Wo
wero dropping shells near tho Cor
hrlilge all during tho chase, and did
not stop until site hoisted a signal
of surrender.
Wo brought both vessels near nnd
sent a boarding party to each. Wo
blew up the Farrlngford with a fow
mines. The Corbrldgo was still
afloat when I last saw her. Sho had
a good supply of coal and we need
ed It.
"Tho capture of. t'ao other steam
bers was not Important. We were
disappointed in most of them and
lost one of tho ships wo .wanted
most.
"We sighted tho Clan McTavish on
Sunday night. January 10. It was
.warm and the sea -was not rough. We
-showed no lights and sho was easy
:to overtake, We had tho Appam then
And we darkened all lights on her.
The McTavish appeared about five
miles off our starboard bow when
we first slgted her. We had heard
r .;, wireless long before that. She

but It was short. We shot away the

first two shells. The Moewe did not
have much to fear. Sho Is too well j

McTavIsh bounced away. ,
"Wo dropped halt a dozen shells
near the guns on the McTavls's
afterdeck and silenced them before
Wy Bhots wero fired. We had
planned to give her a torpedo In case
we did not sink her by shell fire,
"The McTavish could have been
saved but for her own crew. Wo
wanted the vessel for the cargo she
carried, and wo requested that she
surrender without a fight. Had she
done this her officers and crew would
have been landed here with the oth-

J from" Cnptaln Franz Von Papen, the
former German military atacho at

The only reVelatIon historically
jmportant Is that Admiral Von HIn-

Captatn Karl Boy-Ed, the former
German naval attache at Washington

SOCIETY WOMEN WHO
GAMBLE "LOOK OUT"
Madlsonvllle, Ky., Feb. 8. So
ciety was "slapped right in the face
yesterday. HopkinB Circuit Court
convened in Madlsonvlllo and Judge
Carl Henderson, of Marlon, In giving
his Instruction to the grand Jury,
urged that body to investigate so
ciety gambling.
He said much gambling was car
ried on in tho homes and members
of bridge clubs tako home prizes
won in tho game. Judge Henderson
said this was gambling and told the
grand Jury to investigate every case
and to "Indict every woman found
guilty of tho act.'
The Judge told the grand Jury too
much was wasted on petty cases of
the poor negro crap shooter while
society gambling was passed over. It
was the society woman who could In
fluence the citizenship more than the
other clasa and it was the card table
in the home that should be tabooed,
"Investigate this, Indict them, and
then go after the poor negro, and
this UwleMBttjM will be stopped,"

Hunt, Robert Paul, J. J. Richards,
W. S. Scott, officers of the Mongolia,
as well as fifteen Chinese, were
among those indicted.
While the Indictments against the

ed today over the largo number of

government had completed the San
Francisco investigation of the con
spiracy plots. The following were
among those against whom indict

Boston Used As Base.
Boston, Feb. 9, Federal authori
ties were engaged today with re
ports that Boston was being used by
German sympathizers as a base for
tho direction of hostile activities in
Canada.
Reports of this character have
been current for a long time, but
lacked official confirmation. Today
for the first time It was admitted by
a government employe that typewrit
ten copies were made of dictagraph
records alleged to have been obtain
ed at a meeting place of men under
suspicion. This admission was cou
pled with the asurance that It would
be denied If the Identity of tho au
thor was made public.
George' W. Anderson, United
States District Attorney, went, to
Washington on Monday, Yesterday
Edmund BlllBgi, collector of the
port, followed Mr. Anderson to the
etfpltol. - Their loeal 'oSeea would-
not. disclose the nature of their mis
sions. According to the reports which led
to the admission regarding the dic
tagraph records, the movements of
about 100 men havo been watched
with the result that a dictagraph was
installed In a Milk-street office to de
termine if any of these men were
conspiring to commit or influence the
commission of acta of war against
Canada.
