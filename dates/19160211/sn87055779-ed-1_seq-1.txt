Local Police to
Carry Guns Where
They'll be Handy
Conforming to the agitation
sweeping over the country for out
side gun pockets for policemen, the
board of safety Friday morning de
cided that the new u.iiforniH which
will Le ordered soon must be pro
vided with the new revolver pockets.
In Chicago during the past few
weeks half a dozen policemen have
been killed and wounded because
they were unable to draw their guns
from their hip pockets promptly,
while hampered with the heavy
overcoats. Police in other eitlen have
also met with the same difficulty and
the local department ha many timeg
spoken of the danger involved in
carrying guns in back pockets.
Uniform companies will be in
structed by the board to mako pock
ets on both sides of the heavy coats
for revolvers when the new suits and
overcoats are ordered. The board
members believe that lives may pos
sibly be saved by this step. The
board and a committee from the
department is now negotiating with
several companies for the nev-' uniforms.

RUSSIAN WHO NEVER
WORKED IS ALSO HELD
Accused Employe Had Been in
Home Office 20 Years
s-ftd Reputation
Was Good. , .
luternatlor.el News Serrlt e:
LONDON". Feb. 11. Government
agents are conducting an investiga
tion which may rovcal one of the
most serious German plots in Eng
land since the war began. This case,
which grew out of two arrests last
month, is marked by the utmost
secrecy, and has already involved
one employe of the home office.
Those under arrest, so far aa
known now, are:
John McPherson Mitchell Dallas,
a clerk to the inspector of aliens
in the oflice of the secretary of state
for home affairs; and Noi Joachim
Altani. alias Altshuler. a Russian,
who is described upon the records
at Scotland Yard as a professional
singer.
The police charge against the men
is that they conspired between Dec.
1 and Jan. 15 that money should be
corruptly given to and accepted by
Dallas "as an inducement to him to
do divers acts in violation of public
duty and welfare."
Tho police have found that Al
tani has been in this country seven
years and has been employed at very
infrequent intervals, although was
always we'l supplied with money.
He made it a point to cultivate tho
friendship of government clerks and
Dallas became an intimate.
Since the war began Dallas has
been in a position which gave hlru
peculiar opportunities to assist enemy
aliens if he had been disposed. IIa
has had access to the safe-conduct
letters issued by the home secretary
and in addition was able to supply
aluable information.
Tho arrest of suspected German
agents in the numerous espionage
cases which have developed within
the past year have led on more than
one occasion to the suspicion that
enemy aliens were being assisted by
an employe of the government. De
tectives of the special branch of the
criminal investigation department of
Scotland Yard were iet to shadow
ing various employes and suspicion
fell upon Dallas, but his supporters
were loath to accuse him for he had
been in the home ottice for 20 years
with no blemish upon his reputa
tion. However, the evidence was of
such character that the arrest was
made and at the same time the Rus
sian was taken Into custody.
