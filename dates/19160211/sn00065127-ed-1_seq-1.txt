Art Professor Will Help Make
South Dakota Farms More
Attractive.
Vermillion, Feb. 10.—The rural
homes of South Dakota should be at
tractive as well as comfortable, says
Professor Rossiter Howard ot the art
department of the University of
South Dakota, who si nee joining the
University last fall, has been devot
ing lime to the study of the rural
architecture of South Dakola. He is
planning a campaign of education in
the stale for rural buildings that will
combine the qualities of usefulness
and beauty and that will adapt them
selves to South Dakota conditions.
With tliis end in view Professor Ho
ward is working on a series of stere
optieon lectures on rural architecture
which lie intends to give in the state.
The art department will not under
take single-handed the task of develop
ing the rural architecture of South
Dakota. The department of home
economics and the College of En
gineering are giving assistance on
questions of house planning and the
structural problems of house building.
Professor Howard has been getting
material also from Washington and
the east, and from neighboring
states,
where work along these lines has
been done.
Professor Howard has recently re
turned to the United States from
France, where he spent several years
as art lecturer for the Bureau of Un
iversity Travel. An art department,
he says, should not tie merely concern
ed with pictures, it should get in
touch with the state where there Is
the greatest need. He feels there is a
great field in South Dakota in help
ing plan more attractive homes.
Early Settler Passes Awayi.
Oliver A. Red field was born in War
ren county, New York, and on Sept.
17,1840 he moved to Cayuga county,
N. Y., then to Dubuque, Iowa, and
from there to Jackson county, Iowa,
where he was united in marriage to
Jane Anu Ganges In 1858. They lived
at Jessup, Iowa until 1873 when they
came to Lincoln county and located
on a homestead on the banks of Sad
dle Creek iu Lincoln township. About
ten years ago they moved to Be res
ford where he died Feb. 4, 1916 of
apoplexy at the age of 75 years, 4
months and 18 days, Funeral services
were held in the Beresford church,
Rev. Dibble olticiating after which
the undertaker, J. M. Wass, brought
the remains over to Forest Hill ceme
tery for interment.
His father, Wm. Red Seid died in
Buchanon Co., Iowa, in 18Ö7, his
mother on July 5, 1895, his brother
and sister-in-law L. Red Held and
wife, In July and November last year
and are all buried in Forest Hill.
Mr. Red field is survived by bis wife
and seven daughters: Mrs. Mattle
Willis, Yankton Mrs. Lottie Pierce
and Mrs. Millie Landon, both of
Beresford Mrs. Lizzie Northrupt,
Wakonda Mrs. Edna Mlllage of
Beresford Mrs. Ruby Mlllage of Sioux
Falls Mrs.' Alma Kline of Minne
apolis also one-half brother Rev. W.
O. Redfleld of Tripp and one half sis
ter, Mrs. W. N. Parke of Lincoln
township. He was an uncle of Dr.
Roy Parke of Canton.
Rev. A. W. Thurston officiated at
the burial. Mr. and Mrs Redfleld
went through all the trials of having
the grasshoppers take their crops
through the five years of hopper
scourge and all the other trials and
hardships of pioneer life here in our
Dakota of early days, the ups and
downs of which all the old settlers of
the early 70's know what it was to en
dure. Thus our hardy pioneers pass
away one by one to a fairer land.
Easter Late This Year.
Easter Sunday will appear on the
latest possible date this year-April
25. Ash Wednesday and Easter Sun
day were established by the council of
Nice, A. D. 325, the former always to
occur forty-six days in advance of
Easter Sunday and the latter to be
fixed by solar and lunar calculations.
Easter day shall occur, according to
the Nicene laws, annually on the first
Sunday on or after the first full moon
on or after the vernal equinox, which
always is March 21.
This indicates that the earliest date
on which Easter may fall is March 21.
The latest date is April 25. Ash
Wednesday this year will fall on
March 8 and Easter Sunday on April
25. The next period on which Ash
Wednesday will fall an late as March
8 is the year 2106 A. D.
Another event noteworthy because
of its uniqueness this year is the be
ginning of the year on Saturday and
ending on Sunday, This gives the
year fifty-three Saturdays. This
would occur regularly every twenty
eight years except that the compilers
of the Gregorian calendar provided
that centuries not divisible evenly by
four shall not be leap years. Hence
when such a century occurs, as did
1900, there is a lapse of forty years
between leap years that begin on
Saturday and end on Sunday.

St. Olaf Concert Band Never Fails
To Please.
The St. Olaf Concert Band which is
to appear at the Lyric, Canton, on
Saturday evening, Feb. 12th, always
delights Its hearers as Is abundantly
shown by numerous flattering press
comments, some of which are repro
duced herewith:
"A St. Olaf Band Concert Is never
a disappointment. It is a treat rath
er a rare musical treat. Austin could
support two concerts each season
from this band "—Daily Herald.
"The St. Olaf Hand Concert which
was given in the Mankato Theatre
last evening was very well attended
and was a very pleasing event. "-Free
Press.
"The concert, by the St. Olaf Band
was one of the finest musical enter
tainments ever given in this city."—

Farmers' Letters Should Be Busi
nesslike.
Farming is a business farm cor
respondence should therefore be busi
nesslike. An effective business letter
is written upon printed stationery,
preferably with a typewriter.
Some advantage for printed farm:
letterheads are: (1) they force a favor
able impression upon the recipient
(2) they advertise the farmstead more
than unheaded letters (3) they create
family pride in the farm (4) tliey
identify the writer even though his
signature may not be legible and (5)
tliey are just as cheap as any other
sort and more convenient.
Good letterheads may be obtained
of any town printer at reasonable cost..
Local printers are always ready to
offer suggestions in the way of head
ings, choice of paper, color of ink, etc.
No farmer who expects to succeed in
expanding his market can afford to
pass up the services his local editor
has to offer in the way of printing or
advertising.-Geo. A. Starring, State
College.
The high school classes under the
direction of Miss Young are about to
issue a monthly newspaper in order to
make practical use of their work in
English.—Sioux galley News. We
were told last week that the con
tract that had been signed with an
out-of town printing concern without^
the knowledge of the school board had
been ordered cancelled. The matter
will probably be taken up latter.
A change in the two cent stamped
envelope is soon to be made by the
post office department. The new de-1
sign will be printed In red ink. It
will be a circle 1 1-16 inches in di
ameter. In the center will be the
head of George Washington in profile,
looking to the left. The words
"United States Postage" will be.
printed in white letters above and at
the side of the circle. Within the
border and under the head will be
the words "Cents." The numeral "2"
will appear at each side enclosed in a
small white circle.
