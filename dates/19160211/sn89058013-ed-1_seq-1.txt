ON GOOD ROADS
ROADS ONE LONQ HUD HOLE
Editor 13. C. Ilix of the Macon
Couuty News is a real live good
roads booster of the superlative
degree quality, and never loses au
opportunity to put in a hard' lick
for better roads. If Macon Coun
ty does Dot get a system of good
roads,, it Will not be Editor Hix'
fault. In addition to a full column
of editorial paragraphs on the road
question, last week's issue of the
News contained the following argu
ment for better roads, which is ap
plicable to all counties:
"There is something radically
wrong with the road system in
Macon Comity. For a hundred
years we have moped along, filling
tip a few mndholes, shoveling a
little dirt, digging down banks,
piling poles across the road and
this week our roads are practically
one big, long, deep, disgraceful
mudhole. It is true that some
good work has been done in the
last four years. The road officials
and the county court deserve credit
for what has been done- A num
ber of progressive communities
have very materially assisted in
this praiseworthy work. But at
the present rate of building roads
this bunch of folks will be dead
and forgotten before Macon Coun
ty has a decent system of roads.
Something mast be done if we
ever get roads. There is no need
to deny it, nor any need to wait.
Let us offer a proposition :.
1. Borrow $100,000 by issuing
bonds. Some of them to be paid
each year and payment completed
in twenty years.
2. Employ a-competent road en
gineer to survey the roads, taking
tii em out of the creeks and locating
them permanently.
S Elect three or five honest and
competent men- to- control the ex
penditure of the money.
4 See that roads are so built
that the greatest number of peoplo
will be benefited by them.
6i Make ample provisions for the
maintenance of- all the roads con
structed. 1
Here is what it will dor
1. In one year we will have bet
ter roads than will have in twenty
years under the present system.
2; Nearly $100,000 in cold cash
will be brought from other places
and turned loose in this county
to the farmers, haulers, merchants-,
blacksmiths and day laborers.
3. Wealthy men from other
places will move in, bringing fcheir
money and property and help de
velop this great country.
4. Our best citizens will quit
leaving old Macon and going where
they can find more progress we
will have it right here at home.-
i Jackson County has voted $150,
006 16 build, roads and is more than
pleased with it action. The assess
ed valuation of Macon- County's
land is 50 per cent greater than
Jackson. '
Cheatham (Jouuty appropriated
$10,000 to buy the only toll pike
in the couuty, and called an elec
tion for voting $150,000 to build
more roads. The assessed valua
tion of Macon County's land is 40
per cent more than Cheatham.
' Greene Couuty a year ago had a
bonded' indebtedness of $600,000
lot roads and other improvements.
Since then k the people have voted
another $200;000 for more roads.
Just 4hiuk of that!: One little
mountainous couuty has borrowed
$800,000 for public improvements,
which it is enjoying while paying
the cost, and then we are afraid of
$100,000. The assessed value of
Green County's laud is only a trifle
more than Macou County.
What other counties can do, we
can do. If it is good for them, it
is good fop'ns. Xf they are pleased
with it, we will be.
We have slept long enough.
Wake up and get to work. Don't
let every other county in the State
leave us behind.
Talk this proposition over with
your neighbors. If1 you know a
better one, tell us- about it. If you
don't know a- better one, support
this one.
i This paper has always boosted
good' roads of all shapes, forms and
fashions. We believe the above
plan is by far the best for Macon
Couuty,. and the -News expects to
support it.-'

WELL AND IN GOOD HEALTH
Since Taking Cardui, After Seven
Years of Suffering.
Columbia;S. C Mrs. L. C. Hein
mann of 331 Washington Street of
this city says: "I have received so
much benefit from Cardui, I feel
like speaking a good word for it to
every lady I come in contact with,
that I think needs it, hoping to
help someone to get well, as I did.
I had been sick in bed for a loug
time with the change of life. The
doctor tended me all along, and
finally one morning when he came
he said he believed I would have to
go to the hospital yet. I said No!
I then read the testimonials in the
Ladies' Birthday Almanac and then
I phoned for a bottle of Cardui and
commenced taking it, I began to
improve from then on. I took five
bottles continuously, then off and
on for awhile, and I was well
and-have had good health ever
since, I am glad to say. I have
recommended it to a lot of my
friends. I was troubled for seven
or eight years before I took Cardui.
I think it is the best medicine on
earth for female troubles. If this
testimonial will help someone else
you are at liberty to use it if you
like."
Begin takiug Carduf today. It
may be the very medicine you need.
Your druggist sells it. Get a bot
tle from him' today. Adv.

She went down the beautiful
old oak staircase, which is one of
the glories of Oxford, crossed the
hall and eutered the drawing-room.
As she went in, old Casley, the but
ler, was arranging the tea equipage
and pulling a big armchair to the
side of the glowing fire.
The door closed, aud the girl sat
alone in the big, dim drawing-room.
A few tall candles in their massive
silver holders made a little oasis of
light, and the red glow of the fire
was comforting. She was feeling
perhaps a little more reassured in
her mind, when the door of the
drawing-room opened.
"Lady Came," said Casley in his
his-resouudiug voice.
Julia rose from her seat trem

felt upon the eve some extraordiua
