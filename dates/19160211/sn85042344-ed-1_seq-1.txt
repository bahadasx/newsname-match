WASHINGTON, Feb. 10. Secretarj Garrison resigned today
because President Wilson would ni "irrevocably" sup-1
porl the continental army ilnn anil bectiuse he opposes the
administration's program of Betting a definite time for Philippine
independence,
President Wilson acoepted the resignation and lias noi selected
a successor. The president himself probably will take personal
charge of the administration's national defense plans in congress.
Assist ant Secretary Breckenridge also resigned as a mark of
loyalty to 1 1 i - chief, whose views he Bhared. The president accepted
his resignation. Both take effect immediately. Major General
Scott, chief of staff of the army, automatically becomes secretary
of war ad interim.
It is known that one of Secretary Garrison's principal reasons
for liis conviction that only a federal continental army instead of
a reorganized national guard could be the main military depend
ence l the nation was liis belief that sonic day the United States!
may be called upon to defend the .Monroe doctrine and in that I
event he foresaw the national guard might not be available lor use
outside of the United states before a declaration of war.
