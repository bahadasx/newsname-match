TREAT ARMED
AS
Germany and Austria Will Place
New Order in Effect After
February 29.
WASHINGTON NOTIFIED
OF NEW GERMAN PLANS
Will End All Chance of Dispute
Over Submarine Warfare
in Future.
Berlin, Feb. 10.—Germany and Aus­
tria-Hungary purpose to treat as war
ships after February 29, all armed
merchantmen of countries at war
with the Teutonic allies. Germany
already has issued a memoranda to
the neutral governments to this effect
and Austria-Hungary immediately
will do likewise.
Neutral nations are informed of the
ned order of things in the Greek
memorandum "that they may warn
their citizens against further entrust­
ing their persons or property to arm­
ed merchantment -belonging to pow­
ers at. war with the German Umpire."
'Alleged secret instruction by the
British admiralty l'or merchant ships
1o lire on submarines is made the
basis for Germany putting ariu°d
.merchantmen in the*category of war
craft.
Washington Notified.
Germany and Austria formally have
notified the United States that begin­
ning March 1, commanders of their
submarines will consider armed mer­
chant shiys of tfee Entente allies io
be warships and will treat thajn ac­
cordingly.
Under such instructions, a com­
mander would lie at liberty to sink,
without warning, any armed vessel
whether passenger or freight carry
ing.
lligli' btllcia'ls of the state depart­
ment seemed disposed to consider
the development broad enough to war­
rant the claim that the fundamental
questions involved in the conduct of
submarine warfare have been settled
in accordance with the contentions
of the United States.
This is based on the belief that
with Germany and Austria-Hungary
giving notice that they will sink,
without warning, all armed ships, the
government cannot legally claim the
right to sink unarmed vessels. That
is the principle for which the United
•States has contended so vigorously
since the beginning of the negotia­
tions over the conduct of the submar­
ine warfare.
Will Not Create Issue.
In view of this situation, American
citizens, it is stated, by high author­
ity, now may be warned that they
will take passage aboard armed mer­
chant ships at their own risk, and be
entitled to no more protection from
the United States than if they had
embarked upon a belligerent warship.
Officials today seemed not' to be
able to concede that any issue could
arise in the future from a submarine
warfare conducted under these rules.

New York, Feb. 10.—Dr. M. S. In
gils, a Canadian army surgeon, who
arrived today on the Anchor liner,
Cameronia, from Liverpool, declared
that he had knowledge of the capture,
in the British nets, of 17 German sub­
marines and told how the crew ol
tine of them had been found shot to
death, after it had been towed ashore.
Dr. Ingils said he had been allowed to
descend in this submarine and had
seen the bodies.
"To save them from death by suffo­
cation," he said, "the commander had
shot all his men and then himself, ap­
parently."
Dr. Ingils added that the British
are now making use of glass bottom
boats in scouting for submarines in
conncction with a hydrogen air fleet.
GOVERNMENT CLAIM

cording to an announcement made to­

Washington, Feb. 10.—Republicans
of the house military committee as­
sured President Wilson today that a
strong army increase bill drafted in
a non-partisan spirit and accomplish­
ing all the main objects sought by the

Headed by Representative Kalin of
California, ranking minority member
of the committee, the republicans
called at the White House at the Pres­
ident's invitation.
Exchange of Views.
Today's conference was described
l'-iter as friendly exchange of views.
The only difference of opinion was on
the question of the continental army
proposed by Secretary Garrison as a
substitute for the .National Guard irf
Uie lirst line of defense. The presi­
dent was informed that while the
committee opposed the .secretary's
idea, scheme was in process of for
jnuhititin, by which Hie mem tiers felt
|-ei*t.uin the ..National Guard could he
'/e^ded into- an effective instrument
of Rational defense and brought, up to
the strength believed necessary by
military experts.

remarks, it was slated, was his plea
for quick congressional action to put
the country in an adequate state of
defense. He found his hearers in

for the explosion upon the submarine

which resulted in five deaths, was
placed upon the Edison Storage Bat­

company by Lieutenant C.
Commander McGrann' argued that
the real issue 'was whether the Edison
company misrepresented its battery
-or failed to disclose anything it had
reason to believe the navy department
should know in regard to. possible
danger. He held that if naval official*
failed to determine the fact, it was1
not' the manufacturer's fault. He held
the explosion was "anavoidable acci­

ALSO RESIGNS.
MAJOR GENERAL HUGH L. SCOTT
NOW SECRETARY AD INTERIM
GARRISON WAS ALSO OPPOSED TO ADMINISTRATION AT­
TITUDE ON INDEPENDENCE FOR THE PHILIPPINE
Washington, Feb. 10.—Secretary Lindley M. Garrison resigned
today because President Wilson would not "irrevocably" support
the continental army plan, and because lie# opposes the adminis­
tration's program of setting* a definite time for Philippine inde­
pendence. President Wilson accepted the resignation and has not
selected a successor.
The president probably will take personal charge of tile na­
tional defense plans in Congress.
ASSISTANT ALSO RESIGNS
Assistant Secretary Brcckcinidge also resigned as a mark of
loyalty to his chief, whose views he shared. The President aj^
ccpted his resignation. Both take effect immediately. Major Hugh
L. Scott, chief of staff of the anny, automatically becomes Secretary
ol' War, ad interim.
It is known that one. of Secretary Garrison's principal reasons?
for his conviction that only a Federal continental army, instead of'
a reorganized National Guard, could 'be the main militaiy depend-1
encc of the nation was his belief that some day the United States
may be_ called ujwn to defend the Monroe. Doctrine, and in tht&»
event he foresaw that the National Guard might liatixe available,
for use outside of the United States, before a declaration of war.

WILSON
Held Different Views.
Upon the contention on the one
hand that the continental army or ul-,
timately universal service was the naer,
lion's Only reliance^and the position
on the other that no one plan could
be forced upon congress, President
Wilson and his secretary of war part­
ed official company.
Mr. Garrison's resignation was ar
complete surprise to official Wash­
ington generally. He made no per*
sonal explanation. Several hours be­
fore the official announcement he had
boarded a train with his wife for Newi
York, and word had been passed at
the department that he had gone for
an indefinite stay.
The acute differences of opinion
which led to the break began early in
the year, when opposition to the con­
tinental army plan began developing
in congress. There had teen indefi­
nite rumors of the possibility of the:
secretary of war leaving the cabinet,
but they never were continent in offi­
cial quarters. The secretary every­
where was regarded as one of the
strong men of the administration, up­
on whom the president leaned in the
difficult situations, both domestic and
international, which have marked bis
administration.
Correspondence Made Public.
The circumstances which led up to
the resignation are detailed in the
secretary's correspondence with the
president, which was made public to
night by the White House. The pres­
ident, the letters disclosed, belieVed
the training, organization and control
of a military reserve should be under
immediate federal direction, but is
not "irrevocably or dogmatically com­
mitted to any one plan." He wrote
Mr. iGarrison that he could not force
any specific plan on congress, and
added: "I must welcome a frank ex­
change of views and a patient and
thorough comparison of all the meth­
ods proposed for obtaining the object
we all have in view."
Mr. Garrison's contention that only
the plans of the war department
could be considered seemed to the
president "wholly unjustifiable." (Mr.
Garrison considered "reliance upon
the militia for national defense an
unjustifiable imperiling of the na
tion's safety."
Opposea Philippine Bill.
In resigning, he wrote the presli
dent:
"It is evident that we hopelessly
disagree upon what conceive to b«
fundamental principles."
iMr. Garrison characterised tlM
Clark amendment to the Philippine
bill, providing conditionally for the
independence of the Islands within
four years, an "abandonment of the
duty of this nation—a breach of trust
toward the Filipinos." The president'
replied it was his judgment that tho
Clark amendment was "unwise at
this time," bat added: "It wouM
clearly be most inadvisable for me to
take the position that I must disaent
from that action should both hooea:
of congress concur in a bill niiftodj]
ing that amendment"
He said he must withhold Jaig^
