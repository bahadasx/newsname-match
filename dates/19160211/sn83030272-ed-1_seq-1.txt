rcsiunntion has been accepted.
Differences lietween the 1'i'esiilent anil the Secretary over the ipics.
tion of prepurcilness and the Philippine independence legislation were
responsible for the break.
At the same time that he accepted the Garrison reMi:nulioii tho
President received and accepted the resignation of Henry S. Ilreckinridge
of Kentucky, Assistant Secretary of War. Mr. Hrockinridk-e irave as hn
reason for retirinn the firct that he indorses absolutely the position as
sumed liy Mr. Garrison, and, like tlie latter, regarded the differences ni
hcing irreconcilable.
Action by the President in virtually withdrawing; Administration
support from the Garrison continental army plan, mid manifesting a
willingness to treat with its opponents on the basis of a proposal to in
crease the National Guard nt the expense of the proposed continental
army, is understood to have precipitated the break.
Although it has been rumored for some time that Secietary GaiTi-on
felt that the President was not giving his army prepared ne.ss programme
the support to which it was entitled, news of the resignation struck oflicial
Washington almost dumb with surprise.
Successor! Not Picked.
So far as is known, the President has not decided upon the sihci.- or
to Secretary Garrison and Assistant Secretary Ilieckint idge.
By the advocates of national defence ami preparedness the Garrison
resignation is regarded as the scvetest blow that could he struck at their
cause. Secretary Garrison was regarded by them as the most forceful
advocate of national defence. Krom the time he entered the Cabinet and
became acquainted with the weaknesses of the present army system he
has been a consistent cbumpion of a bigger military establishment and
an atlequatc reserve under Federal conttol.
President Wilson, on the-other hand, it is realized, has nut m-pi , I
an equal degree of confidence. At Jim opposed to any incieaso in the
military establishment whatsoever and a pronounced believer in the eilict--.
iveness of the emergency volunteer system, it is felt that his change of

war to the possible dangers threatening the nation.
To a certain extent the same has been said about Sccretnix. nl' the
Navy Daniels.
It is feared therefore that the retirement of Secietary Garn-ot, f,oin
the Cabinet will not only result in n general lack of confidence- in the
Administration's plans, but may result in a cleusage in Congress between
ine e.xireiue militarists aim ine extreme pacilists which will be haul
