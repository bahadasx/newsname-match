College Street Will Be Paved.
Councilmen Deserve Highest
Praise.
The city council in regular
monthly session Monday night
passed an ordinance, which in im
portance will be as far reaching
in the betterment of street con
ditions in Lexington, as any ever
passed by the council ; that of es
tablishing the grade and paving
Sixteenth street from the north
line of South street to the north
line of State street. This street
has long been in a very bad con
dition, but owing to the absence
of a sewer under this street, no
effort had been made to im
prove it. Last summer the sew
er was put down and as a natural
consequence the street was left
in a worse condition than ever.
The sewer problem being solved

could be raised for its improve-
German Sentenced
Paroled.
The young German, Fred Mill
er, who was arrested several
days ago in Kansas City on a
charge of forgery, plead guilty
Tuesday in the criminal court
and was sentenced to two years
in the penitentiary and paroled.
He was paroled to Rev. J. C.
Bierbaum, pastor of the German
Evangelical Church.
The action of ti.e authorities
in the young man's case is very
commedablc, as, no doubt, the
forgery was committed more
through ignorance and bad influ
ence than any intent on his part
to do wrong.

The old-time songs by the

The profusion of flowers was

On Advice From Columbia Two
Young Men Are Arrested
And Lodged in Jail.
The local police received word
a few days ago to keep a look
out for two young men who were
wanted in Columbia, Mo., to an
swer to the charge of highway
robbery. Tuesday afternoon
Marshall Kinkead and Policeman
Pollard found two youngsters in
a saloon answering to the de
scription, took them in charge
and on searching them found
several things indicating that
they had the right parties. The
articles found were two pawn
tickets, one showing where five
dollars had been received on a
gold watch and the other where
fifty cents had been given on a
chain.
The young men gave their
names as Charles Stagsdale and
Dink Reece. They are accused of
holding up a man in Columbia,
and relieving him of a gold watch
and chain. It is said that they are
also'wanted for forgery.
Marshall Kinkead telephoned
