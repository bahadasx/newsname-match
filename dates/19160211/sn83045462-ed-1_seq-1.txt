Surprise to Cfficial Washington. |
Serrotary 'larrison's resictiat ion took ;
official Washington by complete sur- !
prise. Even members of the President's .
official family were unaware of the!
Secretary's contempla'ed adion. al- i
though one of them said that he Knew j
Mr. -Wilson and Mr. Oarris >n differed
over the handling: of the army ;>tans. |
When the President went into the j
middle west recently to speak on national
defense, it was understood that :
he undertook the trip partially at the !
suggestion of Mr. -tiarrison. During!
the tour the President spoke at every J
meeting: in favor of the Garrison army i
plan, but said lie was not particular f
about details as long as a reserve of j
approximately 500.000 trained men was i
secured. It was said today that Mr. ;
Wilson's failure to refuse any compromise
on the subject in his speeches was
the direct cause of Mr. Garrison's
resignation.
Yesterday. Mr. Garrison's last day as
a member of the cabinet, almost passed
without any outward evidence of the
step be was contemplating. fie was
throughout the morning busily occupied
with ordinary routine affairs.
I^ater he dictated a speech which he
had promised to deliver yesterday afternoon
before the annual meeting of
the Chamber of Commerce of the
T'nited Stsli-s in defense of his continental
army plan.
Cancels Hh> Engagement.
It was not until he announced sud- 1
I nl\ late yesterday afternoon that lie;
as leaving the city and would not j
i'-.iver the address that there was the!
' ghtest suspicion that anything un-i
usual had happened. !
The Secretary left the State. War and]
N'avy building with Assistant Secre- j
tary Breckinridge. Inquiry as to |
? where he was goiig and how long he j
would remain brought only the reply j
that he would be "out of town for an;
indefinite stay/' i
The' reason for Secretary Harrison's ,
resignation and its acceptance by the j
President are disclosed in lengthy cor- j
respondence between them which >
has been made public. The cor- i
" respo'ndence revealed that while the
secretary left the cabinet principally .
Itecaiise the president would not "irrevocably"
supfxwt tie* continental army j
plan, his opposition to the administration's ;
program for setting a definite time for
Filipino indejtendence. a'-- outlined in Sen- j
ator Clarke's amendment to the Philip- '
pine bill, was an important factor. The ;
Secretary characterized the amendment j
as "an abandonment of the duty of this j
nation and a breach of trust for the Kili- I
pinoe."
Secretary Garrison contended that]
only a federal continental army, in-{
stead of a recognized Naiofial Guard, j
could be the main military dependence .
of the country, while the 1'residenti
eoniend'-i that no one plan could be
forced upon Congress. It was upon
these two contentions that the break
between the President and his Secretarv
of War came. Mr. Garrison considered
reliance upon the militia for
nat;onal defense an "unjustifiable imperiling
of the nation's safety."
It is expected that the President will
appoint a successor to Secretary Garj
isotj immediately. It is understood
that he wants a man already familiar
w ith the general details of the military
situation of the country#so that plans
? for national defense may be carried
forward witthout delay.
Breckinridge Shares Chief's View.
Assistant Secretary Breckinridge,
? who shared Secretary Garrison's views,
resigned because of loyalty to his chief.
His resignation also was accepted.
Ma}. Gen. Scott, chief of staff of the
army, automatically became Secretary
of War ad interim.
While Secretary I?atie was being considered
in official circles as a likely
choice it was understood that the j
President has under consideration the!
names of two or three other, men, and
will not make an appointment before
weighing their qualifications carefully.
The President has already made up
his mind to appoint a democrat to the
place. it was said in well informed
circles that he will not he from New

chair for the first time since Mr. "Bryan's
resignation. The departure of Mr.
Garrison, with its possible effects on
the administration and the preparedness
program, was discussed thoroughly.
Reports that there might be other
resignations from the cabinet were
met with general denials.
Supporters of the President declared
that he and Mr. Garrison agreed on the
underlying principles of both the military
and Philippine questions, but differed
on the methods of carrying out
their policies. They pointed out that
since Mr. Garrison wrote his first letter,
in Janrary. urging vigorous support
of the continental army the President
had toured the middle west in its
advocacy and was sti'l trying to get
Congress to adopt it.
Policy of Concession.
The President, his friends said,
worked with congressional leaders on
the currency, tariffs and other bills, and
through making some concessions was
able to get bills which he finally approved.
He still feels that it is best
to pursue the same policy in dealing
with the army and Philinpine qucs
Members of the President's cabinet
generally expressed regret today at Mr.
Garrison's resignation. He was very
popular with his colleagues.
Confusion at War Department.
Things at the War Department early
today were all at sixes and sevens in
eons qu<?nce of the unexpected . resignations
or Secretary Harrison and Assistant
Secretary Breckinridge. For
several hours there was no responsible
head of the department. It had l>een
supposed that Maj. Gen. Hugh L*. Scott,
chief of staff, automatically would become
acting secretary of war, but an
examination of the laws on the subject
by Brig. Gen. f'rowder. judge advocate
general of the army, showed that there
was considerable doubt of his authorit
y to do so.
That doubt was based on the language
of an executive order issued by President
Wilson November 12. 191.".. directing Maj.
don. Scott "to jjorform the duties of Secretary
of War during the illness or
temporary absence from the s"nt of government
of the Secretary of War, whenever
during sue'? illness or absence the
assistant secretary of war is also absent."
.Judge Advocate General Growder held
that such authorization did not apply to
a case like the present, when there is no
Secretary of War or assistant secretary
of war either ill or temporarily absent.
Gen. Scott Put in Charge.
A brief statement of the situation
was forwarded to the White House
early in the afternoon by Gen. Scott
for the purpose of ascertaining the
wishes of the President in the matter
and the President issued a new executive
order authorizing Gen. Scott
specifically to act as Secretary of War
at this time pending the appointment
of a Secretary of War and an assistant
secretary of war.
Gen. Scott remained in his own office
all day and attended to all routine
business, but did not sign any official
mail.
Former Assistant Secretary Breckinridge
visited the department this morning
and spent an hour or so clearing up
bis desk and arranging for the removal
of his private correspondence and his
personal effects. He is not in the best
of health at present, not having fully
recovered from a recent attack of grip,
which incapacitated him for duty for
a day or two. He declined today to
discuss his resignation, saying hat the
storv was contained in his correspondence
with the President.

NKW YORK, February 11.?Lindley
Al. Garrison, former Secretary of War,
announced here today that he intended
to retire "absolutely" from politics and ?
public life. He said he would not dis
cuss ms resignanon irom any political
angle. * C
Mr. Garrison intinjated, however, tha-t
he might "do something" in the matter
of giving support to the movement in
favor of a continental army, the issue
1 upon \vhict%p his resignation hinged.
| This intimation came in response to a
[ rmestion put by newspaper men as to
whether he would "give his moral
support to those who continue urging ^
the policy of a continental army." .
Cannot Discuss Politics. [
"I cannot answer that question," ^
said the former Secretary of War, "bet

"I will not discuss my resignation (J
from the cabinet." he said, "from any i

"Absolutely not," was the reply. p

Mr. Garrison- in response to further
1 questions said that he had no knowl

In respect to his own resignation, he .

his intention.
"I assumed," he said, "if Mr. Brcckin- J*
1 ridge remained in the same state of
mind he would resign also." 11
, Mr. Garrison declined lo give a definite
answer as to when his decision to

commanders o( their submarines
; will consider armed merchant
| ships of the entente allies to be
I warships and will treat them aci
cordingly. Under such instructions
commanders would be at j
liberty to sink without warning
any armed vessel, whether pas- i
sender or freight carrying.
The notifications were presented
orally to Secretary Lansing
by Count von Hernstorfi' and
llaron Erich Swiedinek. charge of
the Austro-Hungarian embassy
here.
Notes from their governments
are to follow.
Development of U. S. Memorandum.
The intention of the Teutonic allies
is considered in official and diplomatic
circles here to be a development of the
memorandum proposing the disarming
of merchant ships whicrh Secretary Lansing
recently sent to the entente pow*
ers.
High officials of the State Department
seemed disposed to consider the developmegt
broad enough to warrant the
claim that the fundamental questions
involved in the conduct of submarine
warfare, have been settled in accordance
with the contention of the United
States. That is based on the belief that
with Germany and Austria giving notice
that they will sink without warning
all armed ships, the two govern!
ments cannot legally claim the right
to sink unarmed vessels. That is the
principle for which the United States
has so vigorously contended since the 1
beginning of the negotiations over the
conduct of submarine warfare.
T - ???** ?ftii*atinn American
i citizen8 now may be warned that they
will take pas&age aboard armed merchant
ships at their own risk and be
entitled to no more protection from
' the United States than if they had embarked
upon a belligerent warship.
Give Ships Time to Disarm.
It was said in Teutonic diplomatic
circles that the effective date of the injstructions
was postponed solely for the ''
{reason that the central powers desired
jto give enemy merchant ships an op- {
portunity to disarm and so that the en- j
tente allies might have the chance to ;
make their views conform to the sug- ,
gestions put forward by the Cnited
1 States in its memorandum.
This memorandum declared it was desirable
that merchant ships should be
unarmed, and contained an intimation
' of an intention to regard as warships
armed merchantmen which come into
(American waters.
j The United States acted on the assumption
that no war vessels of the '
I central powers, except submarines. 5
{were at sea. and that a single shell, of
- even a small caliber, fired from a gun
{aboard a merchant ship might sink any
j submarine which attempted to warn <
; her. It was recognized that submarines
had a right to operate in accord , ,
(with international law, but that their i
'commanders could not be expected toil
endanger their vessels and crews in j
dealing with armed ships. ;
Little Opposition Expected. '
While officials of the State Department
declined to discuss the notiflca- 1
tions received, it was admitted in va- '
rious quarters that the question prob- 1
ably would receive little opposition (
j from the State Department. it was 1
| considered that the immediate effect 1
of the notification would be to cause <
the department to announce more <
i quickly than had been deemed advis- c
j able its intention to abandon the old j
| ruling:, made before German cruisers <
j were driven from the seas, which per- f
i mitted merchant ships to carry arms *
for defensive purposes.
The department is known to have
hoped to secure an agreement for all
i of the entente allies to disarm their
merchant ships and then to secure a ^
pledge from the central powers to refrain
absolutely from attacking such *
unarmed ships without warning. These <
undertakings, it was believed, would f
be crystallized into a new principle of j
international law.
a
No Replies From Allies.
| Secretary Lansing said that none of t
the allies had replied to his note. Other i
I officials suggerted that the announced
intentions of the German and Austrian 1
! governments would force the hands of ^
I their enemies. 1
! Confronted with the virtual threat of c
j the I'nited States to classify armed ^
j iTierchatrt snips as war vessels, and s
therefore not entitled to enter Amen- c
can waters more than once in every
six months or to remain more then
twenty-four hours, it was said at one
of the embassies here that if the United
States, in face of the desperate need n
of ships to carry its products abroad, j.
could afTord to exclude from its ports
allied merchantmen, the governments n
owning: them could afford to send in *
only enough to take out goods con- o
signed to themselves. There seemed ti
reason to believe that the view obtain- D
ed at that embassy fairly reflected at \
this time the position of other allied c
governments.
It was said at the embassy, that such s
action virtually would amount to a c
boycott of American ports. It was also 0
contended that such a course would t
be far-reaching and disturbing to u
American trade in general. Jt was
suggested that the -unarmed merchant ii
ships which did enter American ports u
would be met outside the three-mile t
limit by warships and convoyed to I s
their destination, or thst Ahe ships I p
themselves might be armed m sea. 1

the German memorandum is as follows:
"Memorandum of the imperial German
government regarding treatment
>f armed merchantmen.
"Section 1?Already before the outbreak
of the present war the British
government had given British shipping
companies an opportunity to arm
merchantmen with guns. Churchill,
then first lord of the admiralty, on
March 26, 1913, gave in the British
parliament a declaration (text in appendix)
that the admiralty required
(hipping companies to arm a number
>f first-class passenger ships and
liners for protection against dangers
;hreatening under certain circumstances
from swift auxiliary cruisers
>f other powers. These liners, however,
were not to assume thereby the
'haracter of auxiliary cruisers.
"The government was willing to
iiaoc nt the disnosal of the companies
jwning these ships necessary Runs,
idequate mmunition and personnel
suitable for training Run crews.
Based on Admiralty Statement.
"The English companies already acted
>n the requests of the admiralty: The
(resident of the Royal Mail Steam Packet
Company, Sir Owen Philipps, could inorm
the stockholders of his company in

iteamers had been equipped with guns.
"The British admiralty further pubished
in January, 1914, a list showing
hat twenty-nine steamers of various EngIsh

merchantmen according to international
aw:-The British government for its own
merchantmen has taken the standpoint
hat such ships maintain the character
f peaceful mercantile vessels so long as
hey carry armament only for defensive
urposes. The British ambassador at
Washington accordingly gave the Amerian
government, in a communication
ated August 25, 1S14 (exhibit 2). most
weeping assurances that British me?hantmen
were never armed for purposes
f offense, only defense, and that they
herefore would never fire unless tired
pon first.
"The British government, on the other
land, had in the case of armed ships
inder other flags adopted the principle
hat they were to be treated as warhips
and expressly ordered in the
