DEVELOPMENT
WORK^ BEGINS
Commercial Club Directors See
Wide Field for Activity.
WANT FIRE DEPARTMENT
Playground, Federal Building, House
Track' and Other Matterg
Are Taken Up.
Considerable work was outlined by
the board of directors of the Glas
gow Commercial club at the regular
meeting Friday evening, covering a
wide field of activity. The board
plans to keep up the excellent record
for doing things maintained by the
club since its organization.
One of the important matters taken
up by the club is the establishment
of a municipal play ground. This
movement was first directed toward
furnishing an athletic club for the
younger boys of Glasgow, but it was
found that it could not, at this time,
be practically launched. It was de
cided by the committee having the
work in charge to extend the plan
and try to arrange for a wider bene
fit to reach all the children of the
city. The committee is now working
out a plan whereby it is expected a
municipal play ground will be estab
lished, giving all children an equal
opportunity of enjoying outdoor
amusement.
Re-organization of the volunteer
fire department of the city was also
taken up with a committee, of which
W. W. Hurd is chairman. The com
mittee has outlined a proposition
which was laid before the mayor and
council last Wednesday at the council
meeting, which will, if carried out,
give our fire fighting facilities much
greater ability to combat any dan
ger which might arise. With an ex
cellent water system, good appara
tus and plenty of willing volunteer
firemen, Glasgow only needs adequate
quarters and some little changes in
the working methods of the depart
ment to boast the best department in
the state.
F. D. Alvord was appointed the
chairman of a committee to continue
the work of obtaining a proper freight
house and industrial track from the
Great Northern railway. This im
provement has been promised to the
club by the officials of the railroad
and it is known that plans and speci
fications have been submitted to the
St. Paul offices recommending the
work be done. The committee will
bring the necessity of a new freight
house to the attention of officials at
St. Paul and endeavor to secure the
desired improvement at an early date
in the spring.
Another commendable move made
by the club will be the execution of
every effort to secure the passage
of House Bill No. 206, introduced in
congress by Tom Stout. It provides
for the appropriation of $100,000 for
the erection of a federal building in
Glasgow and is a repetition of the bill
introduced at the former session. The
Montana delegation is all favorable
to this measure and the club will use
its influence and exert every effort
to assipt them in putting the bill
through. Prospects are favorable for
Glasgow securing this much desired
appropriation.
Changes in rural routes and star
routes eminating from Glasgow, de
sired by the farmers who receive the
service, will be worked out by the
club. This has been asked for by the
farmers and the club will do its best
to aid them in getting what they
want.
Sugar beets will be grown again
in the Milk river valley by fanners
this year, as was done last. The
club has ordered seed to be delivered
at an early date and this will be
placed among the fanners who are
willing to help by raising a small
amount of sugar beets under direc
tions. The result will be of great ben
efit not only to the farmers but to
everyone in the county, which will be
realized when a factory is built here.
The club will assist the schools of
the county in holding a county grade
track meet in Glasgow the latter part
of the school year. The plans con
template building a circular track and
athletic field where events can be
pulled off and competitive field
events will be staged, covering pos
sibly two or three days. The grade
schools of the county will have rep
resentatives in every competition and
possibly high school students will also
b« provided for. This will be a gala
event for the county students and of
interest to everyone.
Discussion of the new 640-acre
homestead bill and its effects on the
public lands resulted in action being
taken to make it available to all per
sons desiring to take land.
Other matters considered made the
meeting of the board interesting and
demonstrated the club will have plen
ty of work to take up during the en
suing year.
LANDS RESTORED.
The local land office has received
notice from the interior department
j at Washington- that several tracts em
braced in the Malta survey have been
restored and will be opened to entry.
{The lands will be subject to settle
, ment on and after March 6, 1916, at
19 a. m., and will be subject to entry
on April 5, 1916, at 9 a. m., at the
United States land office at Glasgow.
A list of the lands affected follows:
NW 1-4, NE 1-4 and W 1-2 SW 1-4
of section 29, township 31 north.,
range 31 east, and N 1-2, NE 1-4 of
section 31, township 31 north., range

FIRE STARTED WITH
KEROSENE FATAL
Farmer Near Chinook Terribly
Burned—Died Next Day.
Burned from head to foot, with his
clothing hanging in shreds, his hair
and whiskers burned from his head,
J. K. M. Ejsing, a homesteader liv
ing near Chinook, stumbled and ran
through the snow for half a mile to
neighbors for help, says the Chinook
Opinion.
Last Wednesday morning, Ejsing,
who lives about four miles from the
Korn postoffice, got up to build the
fire in the stove in his small shack
where he was living alone. He threw
some kerosene on the fire to kindle
the blaze and there was an explo
sion that filled the room with flames.
The shack was small and was soon
burning all over. Ejsing only had on
a suit of underwear and this became
aflame. Half blinded, he barely man
aged to get out of the burning build
ing, Which was totally destroyed
a few minutes. All of his clothing
and everything in the shack was
burned and by the time he extin
guished the fire in his underwear
there was nothing left of it but a
few shreds of cloth. Naked, his body
chaired, blistered and burned, with,
the Emery home. The neighbors
were hardly able to recognize him,
with his long hair and whiskers
burned off.
Making him as comfortable as pos
sible, Mr. Emery sent a team at once
for a physician and in the evening one
arrived from town. Ejsing was still
conscious, but in terrible agony.
After a night of frightful suffering
Ejsing passed away Friday morning.
The deceased was living alone on his
claim. His wife is in Germany and
intended to come to this country, but
the war prevented her leaving the
old country.
In relating his account of the ex
plosion, Ejsing stated that it was un
like kerosene and thinks he may have
secured gasoline at the store by mis
take.
patches of loose skin hanging from
his body, with one eye closed and
suffering terrible pain, he started
lmrefoot for the nearest neighbor, E.
W. Emery, a half-mile away. He
stumbled and fell in the snow repeat
edly, but finally managed to reach
FREEZING STORY UNTRUE.
The story of the freezing of the
Misses Moore, two sisters, on a home
stead near Havre last, week, is evi
dently without foundation. So far as
can be learned there is nothing to
the yarn that was given out by aj
Butte traveling man, which was pub
lished in all the dailies and many of
the weekly papers in the state. An
investigation was conducted by sev
era) papers, but none were able
confirm the story.
The story was first sent out in
special wire dispatches and was later
told of and enlarged upon by a trav
eling man of Butte, who claimed to
a little town near Havre, where
have seen the bodies of the women in
was calling upon his customers. It j
is believed that the writers of the
special dispatches and later the Butte j
traveling man were misinformed
somewhere along the line.
STATE FAIR DATE SET.
At the recent meeting of the North
Pacific Fair association in Seattle last
week, the dates for the state fairs
in the northwest for the coming year
were set. The Montana state fair
Helena will be held at Heiena from ]
September 25 to September 30.

the Best—Expect to Open
About February 20.
About February 20 the firm of
Vornholt & Smith will openi up a
modern, up-to-date drug store in the
Burke building on south Fifth street,
Realizing that Glasgow is going to
experience greater prosperity than
ever in its history, and that with the
settlement of the surrounding coun
try the business of the city will in
crease by leaps and bounds, Paul
Vornholt and Frank Smith decided to
go into this new venture.
The fixtures and stock were pur
chased by Mr. Vornholt on his recent
trip east and have already been
shipped. The store will open with a
complete line of drug merchandise
and will be complete in every detail.
The fixtures selected by Mr. Vorn
holt are of the very best, every case
and shelf being enclosed in glass. The
fixtures are finished in a silver gray,
which will harmonize perfectly with
the rest of the interior finishings.
_ ,
For the past two months skilled
workmen have been making altera
tions about the building and a beau
tiful front has been put in with spac
ious display windows. Large plate
glass windows, with beautiful Tennes
see marble around the bottom and
prism glass above make the front of
the building the finest and most im

No expense has been spared in get
ting the best fixtures and cases ob
uvtainable and under the able manage
ment of Paul Vornholt, a druggist of
many years experience, the venture
should be a success from the start,
The prescription department of the
store will b one of the main features
| and will be a model of efficiency.
Carl Vornholt, a brother of Paul's,
j will be associated with him in the
j management of the business.
• \ solid marble soda fountain of the
| best m ake and latest design will be

[ outfit in connection. A white sani
tary refrigerator for the storage of
fluid extracts and tinctures has been
ordered from the H. K. Mulförd com
pany of Philadelphia. This will be
used for keeping serums, which con
tain their potency in this great deal,
better than if kept in an even low
temperature. A fine stock of cigars
will be kept on hand and the new
firm will feature the sale of John
ston's and Morse's candies in their
confectionery department.
Paul Vornholt, who will have the
active management of the store, is
well and favorably known in the
city, having managed the Mabee drug
store until about a year ago. His
the article which follows:
"P. C. Vornholt of Glasgow, Mon
tana was in the city for a few hours
on Wednesday en route home from
large acquaintance in the city and
county will be a big asset and "his rare
business judgment and ability spells
success for the enterprise.. >-•.
An interesting article appeared in
the Leeds (N. D.) Newa of February
3, commenting on the new enter
prise. Mr. Vornholt was formerly in
business there and the esteem in
which he is held there is xeflepted in
a business trip to Minneapolis and
St. Paul. Paul, as he is familiarly
totalled by his Leeds friends, is about
to open a drug store at Glasgow and
his trip to the Twin Cities was for
the purpose of purchasing his stock,
furniture and fixtures. His intention
is to put in a first-class stock of
he'drugs and such goods as are gener
ally handled by a drug firm, and
although Glasgow now boasts of two
drug stores, he is confident that he
can get a share of the business. Tudtr
: "g from our knowledge of his ability
to draw and hold business we are sure
that Paul will do this, that he will
give the people of Glasgow a first
. . ,
class store with an up-to-date stock
and that he will make a success of his
venture in the Montana city. He ex -j

of their business venture. Mr. Vorn
courteous manner, together with
keen knowledge of the business, won
him many friends, and his business
career here was marked with won
derful success. His brother, Carl,
clerked for him here and since leav
ing Leeds has finished his pharmaceu
tical course and for some time has
been employed at Beach. We are con
fident that we voice the sentiment of
the people of Leeds in saying, "Good

Living on beans for a week and
with every piece of furniture in the
claim shack chopped up to make fire
wood, with all the books, magazines
and newspapers burned to keep them
from freezing to death in the big bliz
zard that raged in the northern part
of the county for ten days, is the
experience of Ned Bohan, a home
steader living six miles east of Glen
tana, who staggered through the
blizzard, with soft snow to his waist,
to the home of Frank hart, his near
est neighbor, and enlisted his aid in
bringing himself and family to Glen
tana.
Mr. Bohan, his wife and two girls
moved out onto their homestead about
three weeks ago. They left their
horse in Glentana as they had no
barn on their claim. The weather was
fine at that time, so they laid in a
supply of lignite only sufficient to
last them for a couple of weeks, as
most of the farmers in the neighbor
hood who have teams were busy haul
ing grain to market at that time.
Their food supply was also short, as
they never dreamed but what they
could come to town any day to re
plenish the claim shack larder.
Shortly after moving onto their
homestead, the big blizzard, the worst
ever known in this part of the state,
was raging over the north country
and the mercury flirted around the 50
degree below zero mark day after
day. The trails were obliterated and
traveling almost impossible. It was
not long before their scant supply of
lignite coal was exhausted and it was
then that the furniture began to be

LOCAL TEAM WINS
TWO MORE GAMES
Culbertson and Chinook Taken Into
Camp by Local Boys.
By decisively defeating the Cul
bertson and Chinook basketball teams
the Glasgow high school team moved
several rungs up the ladder towards
the championship of northern Mon
tana, and are strong contenders for
the state honors. If the basketball
season in this part of the state were
to come to a close now, Glasgow
would be the undisputed champion of
this district, having defeated every
team which has opposed it. Malta,
Havre, Culbertson and Chinook all
came to conquer, but they returned
sadly disappointed. The local quintet
showed no quarter in any of the
games, but with a determination to
win despite odds, and by resorting to
team work, rather than individual
brilliancy, they are now the leaders
in the race for the highest honors.
Friday evening the local boys took
the Culbertson quintet into camp,
and thereby eliminated them from
participating in the Havre tourney.
