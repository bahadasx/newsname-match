Accidents liavo taken queer forms,
but the trick of Kismet, circumstance,
or whatever It may bo best called,
which destroyed the life of Captain
L. C. Blair of the towboat Sam Drown,
"tjast week, removed a $3,000 life Insur-
mice policy from tho captain's pocket
w and blew It high and dry on the shore
' of tho river hundreds of feet from the
scene of the tragedy.
The policy, supposed by his relatives
to have been lost or at tho bottom of
tho river with the captain's body, was
found by Charles Hcnson, a tenant on
tho farm of Dr. II. A. Drandebury
near Chesapeake. Hcnson took the
policy to the storo of Glllcn & Hicks
at Chesapeake, and it will soon bo re
stored to tho relatives of the unfor
tunate rlverman.
Friends of Captain Dlalr, whoso
homo was at Pittsburg, declare that
ho always carried the Insurance pol
icy In his pocket. Tho force of the
explosion evidently tore away a part
of Captain Illnlr's clothing and car
ried the policy ashore.
The papers were practically undam
aged and had not been In the water,
according to the finder.

When the purchase was made he re

Several days ago he was Informed
by Mr. Evnns that the bale was stll
