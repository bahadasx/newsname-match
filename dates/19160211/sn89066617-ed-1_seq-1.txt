. LAKE IN PARK
V WILL BE HOME
W TWO SWANS
Herman Loeffel Promises
Mayor He Will Obtain
Birds for the Park.
CHAS MOEDER MAY GET
LIVE DEER FROM TEXAS
One Man Offers Eagle To Park
Many Zoo Animals
Available.
The Fairgrounds Park will be the
home of two swans as soon as the
weather becomes warm enough for
them to be kept outdoors regularly.
Herman Loeffel building contractor,
last night annuonced that he expects
to furnish the swans. The m-omise
was made to Mayor Kage and the
proper arrangements to care for the
graceful birds will be made this rprin.
Mr. Loeffel's promise was made when
helearned that the Fairgrounds Park
had been taken over by the City yes
terday afternoon, and simultaneously,
the Mayor discussed plans for the fu
ture of the park.
Interest in the Zoo as one of the
principal features of the park has be
come active in recent weeks and the
Mayor has received many offers of
animals. Many business men in the
Cape have made offers to furnish ani
mals for the Zoo and many farmers
living throughout the county have read
of the Zoo plans in The Tribune and
have spoken to the Mayor, offering na
tive wild animals that they have trap
ped. "I think that one thing to make the
Fairgrounds a real park would be to
have a coup!? cf .rvan. at home on
the bosom of the little .lakes there,"
Herman Loeffel said. "They can keep
themselves and it would be very lit
tle work to look after them. The
only- thing to be guarded against in
my opinion, would be to see that pone
of our amateur or enterprising hunts
men go out there and shoot them."
It is quite probable, the Mayor de
clared, that the City will be able to
obtain a couple of deer from Texas.
Charles Moeder, who returned from
Eig Wells and other Texas points last
week, recently told the Mayor that his
son, who is located in Texas, may be
able to furnish the City with deer
for the park.
There is a law against shipping
: them out of the state, Mr. Moeder
said, but his son declared that he be
lieves if the deer are to be used
for park purposes, the shipment would
be allowed by the state authorities.
Mr. Moeder told the Mayor that the
deer in certain parts of Texas are
slaughtered and left to lie on the
ground without the venison even being
taken care of.
A farmer living near the Cape sev
eral days ago called upon the Mayor
to offer to sell to the City a bald eagle,
which had been trapped in the hills in
the northwestern part of the county.
Several offers of possums and coons
have been made as well as foxes and
other animals that live in this section
of Missouri.
The Mayor last night declared that
the plans for widening the street
along West Broadway from the Boule
vard to the City Limits, skirting the
southern boundary line of the park,
will be carried to a conclusion at an
early date. A new fence will be
erected in place of the high board
fence that now is in place and the
work of improving the interior of the
park will be done by a landscape gard
ener. "The City will have to employ a
man who is expert in the knowledge
of landscape making," the Mayor said,
"and it will be economy to get a good
man who will know what to do with
the natural advantages we have in our
park. Now that we have the Fair
grounds park in our possession, the
City shall endeavor to make it a place
that people from all parts of South
east Missouri will come to view."

Pressman Finds
Three Mice In
His Right Boot
Albert Runnels Uncovers Foot
On Street and Lets Rodents
Out After They Had Tick
led His Toes.
Albert Runnels, a colored pressman
at The Tribune office,' yesterday morn
ing unintentionally took three mice
away from his home on South Sprigg
street in his right boot.
It happened this way: Albert's
alarm clock fell asleep during the
night and when the hour came for it
to awaken the head of the house, there
was nothing doing. Thirty minutes
later, his eyes opened without any
persuader and he glanced at the clock.
The half hour that he had overslept
had to be made up in dressing and get-
ting away.
i;;g K';3 a
He slipped into his cloth -
city fireman, snatched a
few biles of breakfast and started for
h: office.
He was walking rapidly and had
gone more than a block from his hoirie
when' he was startled by a wiggling
sensation in the toe of his right boot.
He pasucd, moved his toes, and actually
jumped when he felt something fid
dling with his large toe. It felt like a
cockleburr.
He leaned against the fence and re
moved the boot. He looked at his
toes, but discovered nothing. A glance
down the boot revealed a mouse.
"Get .out of there, you liittle rascal,"
said Albert as he tipped the leg of the
boot. The mouse complied. The little
rodent hopped out and scurried away
under the sidewalk.
Albert then started to draw on the
boot and saw another mouse. "Beat
it!" he shouted down his leg, and
mouse No. two jumped out and ran as
hard as it could for a hole under the
walk.
Once more the pi'essnian started to
shove his foot back into the boot when
he saw the third mouse "Hey! What
do you want down there?" he demand
ed. "Get out and take all -of your
friends with you."
Mr. Mouse leaped out and landed cn
the walk. Albert hurled a club at the
little rodent as it dived into a hole. He
then turned his boot upside down and
shook it vigorously. Then he shoved
his foot in to it and hurried to the
office.
He believes the mice would have
remained quiet, if the air in the boot
had not become contaminated.

ARRESTS T. TATUM
AT PORTAGEVILLE
W. J. Seagraves Goes After Boy
Wanted For Check Job
In Cape.
Tom Tatum, scion of a family form
erly well known in Southeast Missouri,
yesterday was arrested in Portageville
and held for the authorities in the
Cape on a charge of obtaining money
under false pretenses, by cashing two
checks in the Cape when he had no ac
count in the bank against which he
checked.
Deputy Sheriff W. J. Seagraves
early this morning departed for Por
tagevillo to bring Tatum back to the
Cape. Seagraves has a warrant for
Tatum's arrest issued on the complaint
of H. H. Haas, of the St. Charles
Pharmacy, where one of Tatum's
checks was cashed.
He is expected to arrive in the Cape
this afternoon with his prisoner. Sea
graves received word of Tatum's ar
rest late yesterday afternoon from the
police in Portageville.
Tatum had entered a store in Por
tageville toTmake some purchases. He
offered in payment for his bill of
goods a check for $15 on the Sturdi
vant bank in the Cape.
The proprietor of the store took the
check to the cashier of the Portageville
bank, who in turn called the Sturdivant
bank by long distance telephone and
asked if the check was good.
Mr. Haas had given all the Cape
banks notification of the check he had
received and when' the call from Por
tageville came, the banker there was
told to have the marshal arrest Tatum
for the Cape police. .
The merchant returned to his store
with the marshal and found Tatum.
Tatum submitted to his arrest without
a word.
He arrived in the Cape on January
31 and registered at the St. Charles
Hotel, where he ran up a bill of $14.50.
Monday he ordered a fifty cent pre
scription at the St Charles Pharmacy
and paid for it with a check for $2.50,
receiving $2 change.
He then cashed a check at the
American Clothing Store for $4 and
when he prepared to depart, he offered
Joe Moore, night clerk at the St.
Charles Hotel, a check for $14.50 to
cover the amount of hia bill. Moore
refused to accept the check after learn
ing that the man had no account in
the Sturdivant Eank, on which it was
drawn, and held his baggage, a suit
case and a traveling bag.
Tatum departed without endeavor
ing to take his bagagge and disap
peared from the Cape. His luggage
contained four suits of clothing of
FAIR ASSN. WILL
CUT A $30,000
MELON MONDAY
Deal For Sale of Fairgrounds
Park Closed Kage
Gets Deed.
NO STRINGS ARE TIED
TO CITY'S OWNERSHIP
Fair Board Wil! Declare First
Dividend v200 Per Cent at
Once 2nd In July.
A $30,000-melon will be cut next
Monday afternoon by the Board of Di
rectors ofthe Fair and Park Associa
tion, it was announced last night aft
er the final steps had been taken in the
purchase of the fairgrounds as a city
park.
The deed for the property, signed by
President Charles Blattner and Secre
tary Herman Bremermann, yesterday
was delivered to Mayor Kage in re
turn for which, the Mayor tossed
Clyde Vanclivort and Mr. Bremermann
one of the city's saffron colored war
rants good for only $30,000.
That ended the campaign for a city
park that began more than two years
ago and was won only after the matter
was carried through court litigation
and finally received the approval of
the voters of the Cape by a majority
of near!y three to one.
The money with which to buy the
park had been lying in the First Nat
ional Bank to the City's credit for
three days and the final closing of the
deal awaited the adjustment of some
financial matters by the Fair Associa
tion. A series of $4,000 worth of bonds
had been issued against the park
property which constituted the only
lien upon the park and President Blatt
ner removed that incumbrance before
closing the deal for the sale of the
land to the City, so that the property
vhich the City received i3 clear.
The deed relates briefly the proceed
ings of the Council leading to the issue
of the park bonds. It bears a $30
stamp and covers several typewritten
pages.
The announcement of the meeting
) the directors of the Fair Associa
ion was made last night by Clyde
Vandirort, one of the heavy stock
holders in the association.
Treasurer John L. Miller a couple of
days ago declared that the first divi
dend that will be paid on the stocks
nrobably will amount to 200 per cent
and a balance of about $3,000 will be
he'd in the bank to take care of any
expenses that may arise within the
next few months!
The final wind-up of the Associa
tion's affairs will be made about July,
when the second dividend will be paid
-,nd all the stocks cancelled.
President Charles Blattner has been
;11 at his home on the Bloomfield road
with a severe attack of grip and bron
. hitis for several days and the final
teps in the park sale were conducted
from his home to a great etxent. He
has not been able to come to the Cape
for some time, but it is anticipated
hat he will be able to make the trip
to town for the meeting planned.
It is also understood that Harry L.
Machen, one of the directors of the as
sociation, will return to the Cape from
the South to attend the meeting.

POTTIE WILLER
DIES AFTER ONE
NIGHT'S ILLNESS
Stricken With Pneumonia In
Afternoon, He Becomes De
lirius and Succumbs.
TWO MEN BATTLED TO
KEEP HIM IN HOUSE
Son of Veteran Justice Was the
Largest Man In The
City.
William F. (Pottie) Willtr, son of
Judge - and .Mrs. W. H. Wilier died
shortly after 5 o'clock this morning of
pneumonia, after an illness of but a
fcAV days. He became seriously ill
only- yesterday afternoon and died
without removing his clothing.
Early last night his fever developed
to a dangerous degree and he became
delirious. His mother and two men
battled with him for several hours to
prevent him from leaving the house.
He became quieted shortly before 4
o'clock and fell asleep. He awakened
about an hour later and suffered a
sinking spell. In spite of heroic ef
forts to revive him, he ditd without re
gaining consciousness.
It required the strength of two men
to hold William F. Wilier, son of Judge
and Mrs. W. H. Wilier, in his bed at
his home on Good Hope street, early
this morning, when, in a delirium that
accompanied a severe sinking spell
from pneumonia, he get up,
dressed and started to leave the house.
In his delirium, he believed that ho
was not at home and he declared that
he was going home.
Mr. W-iller is the biggest and prob
ably the strongest man in the Cape
and the struggles of two men who
were aided by his mother, Mrs. Helena
Wilier, in keeping him inside the
house, were supplemented by contin
ual arguments with the delirious man,
attempting to restore him to normal
condition.
He failed to recognize the mei
who worked with his as well as his
mother. At 3 o'clock this morning,
however, the three had succeeded in
keeping him inside the house and he
was contented to sit on the side of his
bed not allowing any of the clothing to
ne removed.
To have permitted the man to leave
the house, would have been exremely
dangerous to his condition, according
to the physician in attendance.
Mr. Wilier became ill several days
ago when he was confined to his hona
at 43SG ood Hope street, with a severe
cold and sb'ght touch of the grip.
Last week he was forced to go to be I
and he gradually became worse.
It was not believed that his illness
would be dangerdus, but yesterday, the
doctor announced that one of his lung
was affected with pneumonia and that
his condition was critical. He suffered
from hemorrhages of the lungs vir
tually all day long and last night at C
o'clock, he went into the f.rm delirium.
Mrs. Wilier was attending her son
alone at the time the first delirious
attack began, and she ran to the tele
phone to summon aid. Charles Wer
ner and A. companion ran to the Wil
ier home from Haarig and aided in
holding him in bed. The first attac't
lasted for nearly three hours and it
was after 9 o'clock that he went o
sleep.
Arrangements were made for the
two men to watch overnight at th;
bedside of the sick man and early th?3
morning, he was seized with the sec
ond attack of delirium. He woke an-i
the struggle began immediately to
keep him from getting out side the
house where he would be exposed to
the cold night air.
Owing to Mr. Willer's great weight,
the physician declared, it is very dif
ficult to administer the medicines
properly to him, for doses that wokUI
be given to others, wouM be exceed
ingly dangerous to Mr. Wilier.
