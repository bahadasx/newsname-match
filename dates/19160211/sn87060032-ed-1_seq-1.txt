Circuit court adjourned here
last week and convened this week
at Whitley City, McCreary Coun
ty, with Judge Flem D. Sampson
presiding. The Judge has little
time between court terms, and he
is a tireless worker. It is said
by lawyers at the Bar in his courts
that he tries and disposes of more
case3 than any other judge in
Kentucky. During the last few
days of our court it was presided
oyer by a Special Judge. Judge
Sampson desiring to be away in
trie interest of his candidacy for
Appellate Judge, it was agreed
by party litigants that Hon. Thos
D. Tinsley preside. Judge Samp
son thus relieved, took advantage
of the time, and visited quite a
!number of the twenty seven coun
ties composing the 7th Appellate
District. He returned to his cir
cuit court district elated over the
encouragement received. The Re
publican voters are going to no
minate Judge Sampson at the
August Primary for their "candi
date. When the entire membership
of the Knox County Bar endorsed
Judge Sampson for this high off
ice, as was heretofore published
in our columns, it was a tribute
' to his high legal attainments and
his ability as a judge. When the
Pflfi of Knox County endorsed

ing as a jurist, but was an en
dowment of him as a man and
good citizen, and a candidate
- worthy of their votes.
When the Sunday Schools and
Churches of his home town of
'Bwbourville all joined in endors
ing him, and as a. token of their
appreciation of his services on the
.Bench as their Circuit Judge,

Now comes the news through
the press and by personal can
vass and inquiry that his candi.
dacy is being received favorably
among the good people through
out the 7th Kentucky Appellate
District generally.
Store Broken Into
Last Tuesday night the store
of P. J. Wyrick was broken into
and a great deal of goods and
money was taken, and when Mr.
Wyrick discovered the theft, he
at once called the Advocate man
for information as to where he
could get some Blood Hounds
with which to chase the criminals
and we at once telephoned to
Middlesboro, where we procured
the services of James Farmer
who came on Train No. 22 and
he at once went to the place,
and put the dogs on the trail and
it is said that they ran down the
fellow who did the work, but we
have failed to this time to find
out who the party is.
Hays-Golden
Wednesday morning at 9;30
o'clock Capt. B. B. Golden and
Miss Lila Hays were quietly mar
ried at the home of the bride's
father, J. N. Hays, on Main St.
Those present were only a few of
the close friends of the parties.
The ceremony was performed by
Rev. J. W. Ligon, pastor of the
First Christian Church.
After the ceremony the happy
pair left on the 10 o'clock train
on their honeymoon. They will
make a tour of the Eastern States
and will not return for several
days.
Captain Golden is a member of
the Knox County Bar, and is one
of the best lawyers in the state,
and has a lucrative practice.
Miss Hays is the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs, James N. Hays of this
city, she is one of Barbourville's
best and sweetest girls.
We wish these people much
happineas. ,

Sayings by Lincoln
No man is good enough to gov
ern another man 'without that
other's consent.
When the white man governs
himself, that is self government,
but whenhe governs himself and
also governs another man, that
is more than self government
that is despotism.
This government cannot en
dure permanently half slave and
half free.
I have always thought that all
men should be free, but if any
should be slaves it should be,
first, those who desire it for
themselves and, secondly, those
who desire it for others.
Let us have faith that right
makes might, and in that faith
let us dare to do our duty as we
understand it.
Public sentiment is everything
With public sentiment nothing
can fail: without it nothing can
succeed. Consequently he who
molds public sentiment goes
deeper than he who enacts stat
utes or pronounces decisions.
He makes statutes and decisions
possible or impossible to be exe
cuted. Our fathers brought forth a
nation conceived in liberty and
dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal.
If there be those who would
not save the Union unless they
could at the same time save sla
very, I do not agree with them.
I do not agree with them. If
there be those who would not
save the Union unless they could
at the same time destroy slavery,
I do not agree with them. My
paramount object in this strug
gle is to save the Union and is
not either to save or to destroy
slavery.
The Underwood Tariff law did
not succeed in reducing the cost
of living, but it certainly re-
duced the revenues.

-Taylor In Los Anal Tlmtt,
Tariff Out of Politics
Take the worship from religion.
Or nutrition out of food;
Take the wetness out of ocean,
Or all virtue out of good.
Take all saltiness out of brine,
Or the bitterness from galls;
From the sun take all the shine,
From Niagra take the falls.
From the mules the bray infernal,
From the elephant the trunk,
From Bull Moosers take the Colonel-Let
steam rollers roll, kerplunk
But the doctrine of Protection
We'll emasculate? Oh, no!
Though the Free-Trade politician
Storm and rave and sweat and
blow.
Not an academic question
To be bandied by "professors"
'Tis the glory of protection
Its denfiers are aggressors.
Fighting for our own home mar
kets
Is a fight for the red-blooded;
Prosperous markets, shining
targets.
Not with smokeless chimneys
studded.
Out of politics? The folly!
Out of fumbling, out of blun
der! Ho, wage earners! Charpe and
rally!
Save your jobs and live, by
thunder!
Live on Yankee scale, not
Europe's;
Independent, busy, free.
Why should any think that
you're dupes
To Free-Traders' sophistry?
Out of Politics? Protection?
Then a church without a creed
A republic sans election
Rouse, ye people, think and
rend!
A good way to take the Tariff
'out of politics would be to take
it out and keep it out of the
Frteyirftftewgrewmtn's hands.

Indict Women Who Play
at Card Tables for Prizes
New Jurist Denounces So
ciety Methods in His
Charge to Hopkins
County Grand Jury
Madisonville, Ky., Feb. S.--1
Judge Carl Henderson, of Mar
ion, gave some specific instruc
tions to the grand jury yesterday
when the Hopkins Circuit Court
convened in Madisonville, rela
tive to the society gambling that
was being carried on in all cities
and towns, and urged the grand
jury to investigate all bridge par
ties and indict every society wo
man that was a player of cards
and winning prizes. He stated
that you might read in any paper
where a card game had been
played in higher society and
some prize had bad been won.
He said these society woman
had much more influence on the
city, and town than a lower class
had, and it was the duty of the
grand jury to probe the caul
games and stop this terrible crime
He told the grand jury in the
charge that too much time was
taken up with the poor negro and
n class of that nature, where it
was a game for something to eat
and wear, and the higher society
ladies piayeu tor the booty as
W9ll as the poor negro, and" they
this wonderful
m
&

were never molested. "Indict
every woman, no matter who she
is. if she is causrht nlavinor cards
for booty, and stop this terrible
crime of teaching boys to be ram
blers and then drunkards."
The card table is the ruination
of many a boy, and that card ta
ble is in the home, and in after
years the mother wants to know
how her son ever learned to be
such a notorious wreck. Investi
gate the society gambling first
and then go after poor negro and
the ignorant class of people.
Underwood to Oppose)
Tariff Commission
Senator Underwood, of Ala
bama, author of the Underwood
Tariff bill, announced to-day that
he will oppose President Wil
son's plan for a Tariff commis
sion. Mr. Underwood intimated
that his opposition would be of
an active character.
Mr. Underwood is not the only
important Democratic leader
who is out of sympathy with
this new proposal by the Presi
dent. Representative Kicthin,
majority leader in the House, '
does not favor the Tariff commie
sion idea, but probably will not
actively oppose it.
