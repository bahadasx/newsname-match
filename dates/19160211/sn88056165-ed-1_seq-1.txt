OFFICER HAS
NARROW ESCAPE
Deputy Sheriff Eller Fell Over
Cliff and Came Near to Go
ing Over Another—Injuries
Only Slight.
Deputy Sheriff Bill Eller was
in town last Friday evening and
told us of a rather hair-raising
experience that befell him the
night before as he was trying to
get down to the George Bargund
home on Salmon river through
the'deep snow. He left Grange
ville in the afternoon on horse
back and started down the Gill
point just about dusk. The first
part of the descent was accom
plished without trouble but, on
reaching a point where one of
two ridges was to be taken, he
chose the wrong ridge in the
fading daylight and with every
thing covered with a deep blank
et of snow, and his horse soon
refused to travel and Bill had to
get offjand lead the animal by
the bridle reins. -They slid over
a little rock ledge a few feet high
that was hidden by the snow and
a few feet farther Bill suddenly
stepped off into space. His grasp
on the bridle reins straightened
Bill up and saved him from going
down head first to certain death
but as it was he fell fully twenty
feet and shot down the steep hill
side for some distance through
the soft snow. In the fall his head
and shoulders came in violent
contact with the earth and he
was knocked s'il y f <r some time.
After regaining his faculties he
saw some one in the canyon be
low strike a match and called to
them for help. The parties prov
ed to be John Burgund and Wal
ter Larson, who had been breast
ing the deep snow all day in
walking from this place to the
Burgund home, and were almost
exhausted at the time. They
could not climb the steep canyon
side but went on to the cabin and
sent George Burgund back with
a lantern to the aid of the officer.
After a couple of hours George
Burgund appeared in sight and
called that he was almost ex
h&u ited and asked Eller to try to
get down where he was. The
latter started and went only
few feet when he almost stepped
off of a 40-foot bluff, falling back
just in time to save himself.
After some time Burgund got up
t > where he was and they then
wc rk d b ick up the hillside to
the horse, which was still stand
ing on top of the c'iff where Eller
had fallen over and had not mov
ed out of its tracks. With the aid
of the lantern they finally worked
down the hill to tl e Burgund
iabin, arriving there at midnight
and mighty glad to be on level
ground again.
Eller he has put
Deputy Eller says he has put
in considerable time on Salmon
river and knows the country
p etty well in that particular lc
cality but will leave it strictly
alone in future at night and with
snow on the ground. He was so
sore the morning after the acci
dent he could hardly get out of
bed but considers himself very
fortunate in escaping as easily as
he did.
H. H. Nuxoll came up from
Clarkston Wednesday evening to
look after business matters for a
few days.
Fred McKinney dropped off
here Tuesday evening for a short
visit with his father while en
route home to Grangeville from
a trip to Wallace. Fred has taken
a contract to furnish pork for the
Ht rcu'es mine at Burke and is
shipping a car of fat hogs to Wal
lace about every sixty days.
Stockmen On The Move
B. F. Taylor moved most of his
cattle over onto the Doumecq the
first of the week where he secur
ed a supply of feed for them.
Jones & Platt are reported to
have moved quite a bunch of
their cattle down onto Salmon
river during the week where they
can get feed for the animals.
George Behean, the Salmon
river stockman, has contracted
for between 300 and 400 tons of
timothy and wild hay on the
Walter Hickerson ranch west of
town, and is expected to arrive
tonight with a large bunch of his
cattle from the Whitebird ranch
to consume the same. The hay
will be fed right on the ranch.—
Grangeville Globe.
Carl Flynn, perhaps the big
gest stockman on the east side of
the Salmon, is said to be feeding
about 800 head;[of his cattle in
the Forest country and the bunch
is consuminglfrom ten to |fifteen
tons of hay per day. While Mr.
Flynn still has quite a lot of hay
on hand it takes a great deal to
run him and he"will gladly wel
come a .thaw that will remove
the snow andienable him to take
the cattle back to the river range
again.
Name Farm and
Have Letterheads
The farmer canlsell his annual
receipts by using I good printing
and by occasional advertising in
the weeklies of his county, says
D. W. Morton, dean of the new
school of commerce of the Uni
versity of Oregon.
A farm letterhead should carry
the name of the farm, the name
of the owner, the location of the
farm and perhaps a small picture
of some feature of the place, says
Dean Morton, who regards the
farmer as a business man with
substantial investment upon
which he should make every ef
fort to pay interest.
"It gives the farmer a certain
business standing if he has neat
letterheads of good stock, and it
improves the value of his farm
to have a name and something of
an individuality," he said.
"There is some initial-expense in
having a picture taken and a cut
made, but the publisher of the
nearest country paper will attend
to the details and afterward will
do the printing reasonably.
"If the farmer raises high class
animals, his letterhead may con
tain a picture of a prize animal
with its record; or if he has a
stock farm, a picture of a bunch
of stock; or if he has the best
house or barn in the neighbor
hood, a picture of that; or a pict
ure of a grove or a stream is
usually effective on stationery.
There are few farms not worth
naming, and few that do not pro
vide something worth a perma
nent picture.

"Adwr.ising nts are very
low in country papers and a farm
er at a cost of from 10 to 50 cents
may often sell a horse, a second
hand machine, or some other
thing about the place he does not
need by putting a small adver
tisement in his weekly paper.
"A farmer's advertising should
of course conform to the best ad
vertising standards; it should be
very definite and absolutely
truthful."
The bills for the Washington's
birthday ball, to be given Feb. 22
^y the Pythian Sisters, say to
come dressed in Colonial style
but this is by no means obliga
tory. It is desired to have as
many as possible dress in this
style but those who do not care
to go to this trouble are urged to
attend the dance just the same
and wi(l be shown a fine time by
the management.
Had Exciting Encounter
With A Canadian Lynx
C. W. Bird, who resides at the
old Hoene sawmill northwest of
town, had quite an exciting en
counter with a big Canadian lynx
last Saturday morning and, while
he succeeded in killing the ani
mal without coming in close con
tact with it, does not care to re
peat the encounter. Mr. Bird
heard his dog making a commo
tion early Saturday morning but
thought little of it as he had the
dog shut up in the hen house to
keep intruders away from the
fowls. A few minutes later he
heard the chickens squacking
and on going to investigate saw
what he thought to be a bob cat
in the house. The dog was giv
ing the intruder as wide a birth
as possible and made his escape
from the building as soon as the
door opened. Mr. Bird was arm
ed with a single shot srnali gauge
shot gun and gave the lynx a
charge of shot in the side of the
neck. The animal retreated to
the far end of the building and
Mrs. Bird then came in with a
Reports on Lumber v
Conditions on Outside

W. B. Hussman returned Tues
day from a trip to outside points
including Spokane and Coeur d'
Alene, and reports the lumber
industry has taken a decided
turn for the better in the last
sixty days. The large mills in
the Inland Empire and on the
coast have all advanced their
prices and find themselves con
fronted with a serious car short
age in supplying their trade.
This should be good news to all
the local mill men for they will no
doubt realize better prices locally
and for their shop in future. At
Coeur d'Alene he found the
Blackwell Lumber company ar
ranging for a large silo trade in
the middle western states, Min
nesota, Montana and the Dakotas.
This company is a subsidary of
the Weyerhauser syndicate and
an idea of the magnitude of their
operations may be gleaned from
the fact that they ordered silo
irons to the amount, approximat
ing $25,000 and were unloading,
at the time he was there, five
carloads of hoops, one of lugs
and another of door irons. This
company is making the same silo,
the Eureka, that Mr. Hussman is
interested in, and such evidence
of faith on the part of such
large company has given him new
faith in the merits of thio silo.

lamp, when the animal sprang at
them and received another charge
of shot. It then got into a hole
under a manger and Mr. Bird lay
down to get a shot at it. As Mrs.
Bird held the light down so her
husband could see to shoot the
lynx charged them and received
the finishing shot full in the
mouth, blowing away its entire
lower jaw and killing it on the
spot.
When hauled out into the day
light the lynx was found to be
an extra large one and, although
very poor, w iighed 40 pounds
and stood almost as high as a
good sized dog. It had killed
several chickens during the short
time it was in the house and
showed absolutely no fear of the
dog (in fact the fear w as entirely
on the dog's part), and Mr. Bird
feels very well pleased in killing
the animal without getting any
closer acquainted with it. He
has preserved the fine skin and
will sell it.
Stock Doing Well
on Upper Salmon
Fet Rhoades came out Wed
nesday from the upper Salmon
river, where he has been for the
past few months assisting his
brother Jay on the ranch, and
dropped off here for a day's visit
with, relatives and old friends be
fore going on to Lewiston where
his family resides. Fet says the
firm of Holt & Rhoades is feed
ing about 900 head of cattle on
the upper river this winter and
the stock is all doing well as they
have plenty of feed to see them
through, no matter how long the
snow may last. Only about six
inches of snow fell at the Jay
Rhoades place on Rapid river and
this was all off the low ground
before he left. At the Holt
ranch about fourteen inches of
snow fell and the farther this
way he came the deeper the fall
seemed to have been. Hardly
any losses have been sustained
by the stockmen along the upper
river, although the snow fell
there deeper and the cold was
more intense than it has been
for years, and Mr. Rhoades does
not look for any losses in that
section as most of the stockmen
have feed enough to last until
the stock can get out onto the
range again.
