DISAGREES WITH
WILSON OVER PLANS
President's Failure to Agra* Insist
on Continental Army Program as
Against All Others Brings About Res
ignation—Garrison Also Opposed to
Plans For Philippine Independence—
Wilson to Bess Job of Successor.
Washington, "Feb. 11.—Secretary
Jr, Garrison has resigned from the caibi
net because President Wilson declined
to insist without compromise on the
J^T* adoption of the continental army plan
by congress. The resignation was!
tendered and accepted last night, and ^h"a®tr,ts: Secretary Houston former
louuczcu •n.wp Governor Harmon, of Ohio, and former

president, who had made a careful
study of the problem, will continue to
handle the preparedness plans himself
to a great extent.
Why He Quit.
The reason for the secretary's resig
nation and its acceptance are dis
closed in lengthy correspondence made
public between them. The secretary
resigned principally because the presi
dent wotild not "irrevocably" support
the continental army plan. His op
position to the program for setting a
definite plan for Philippine independ
ence, also outlined In Senator Clark's
amendment to the bill was an im
portant factor,
Secretary Garrison contended that
oply a continental army instead of a
ii recognized. natfonal guard could te the
main military dependence of the coun
try, wlille the president contended that
no pne plan could toe forced upon con
gress: wr.s. npon two con

Assistant Secretary Breckenridge,
who shared Secretary Garrison's views,

His resignation was also accepted.

licans alike on the committee were op-
posed to the continental army scheme
and that ^t had no ohance of being ap
proved.
1^. Secretary Garrison would not admit
that there properly could be modiflca
tions of the plan.
The president and Secretary Garrl
0on have been close personal friends
since the administration came into of
flee and have stood together on prac
tically every question.
It was officially announced at the
White House last night at. 8 'o'clock
that Secretary Garrison's resignation
had been accepted by the president
and a few moments later the resig
nation of Henry C. Breckenridge, as
sistant secretary 6f war, was an
nounced.
Wils^tv Still Favors Plan.
President'Wilson has supported the
continental-army scheme and con
tinues
ito believe that it is the best plan
for stf-engthteftlftr the army. He has
made it plaliii however, in speeches
and in talks with congressional leaders',
that the main thing is
sented in planning for defense against
any possible enemy.
Busy Far Into Night.
For months it has been a common
Bight at the war department when he
"has been in the city, to see the lights
in his office blazing far into the night,
Surrounded by his bureau chiefs and
officers on staff duty, the secretary
went into every aspect of the case with
all the concentration he developed as a
lawyer and a member of the New Jer
sey judiciary.
Out of that study came the plan for
the continental army and the corre
lated increases in tlie regular army and
proposals for coast defense and a huge
reserve for war material which con
stitutes the administration prepared
ness1 plan, so far as the army is con
cerned. Behind that plan the presi
dent has stood.
Mr. Garrison recently declared for
universal military training as a doc
trine of democracy, altho he said he
thought the nation not ready for such a
proposal at this time. He has re*
peatedly said both publicly and In pri
vate that he was so full of the subject
of preparedness and of the need for it
as a result of his studies, that he
dreamed of it at night and it was with
him every waking moment.

"While Secretary Lane was being
considered in official circles as a likely
choice, it was understood that the
president has under consideration the
names of two or three other men and
will not make an appointment before
weighing their qualifications carefully.

his mind to appoint a democrat to the

before the Chamber of Commerce of

Mrs. Garrison left for New York, and
It was said at the war department that

Mr. Garrison, with its possible effects
on the preparedness program, was dis
cussed thoroughly.
Reports that there might be other
resignations from the cabinet were
met with denials.
Not Far Apart:
Supporters of the president declared
that he and Mr. Garrison agreed on
the underlying principles of both the
military and Philippine questions but
differed on the methods of carrying out
the policies.
The president, his friends said,
worked with congressional leaders on
the currency, tariff and other bills,
and tho making some concessions, was
able to get bills which he finally ap

Austria Holds British War

Deolares British Government Has In
cited Merchantmen to Commit Illegal
Acts—British Admiralty Caused Lin
ers to Be Armed in 1913—Neutrals
Warned Against Danger of Exposing
Themselves or Good* on Allied 8hips.
Vienna, via London, Feb. 11.—The
text of the memorandum communicated
by the Austro-Hungarian foreign office
today to representatives of neutral
countries announcing the decision of
the government to treat as warships
armed merchantmen of nations at war
with this country. Is as follows:
"It is not known to neutrals powers
that the British admirality during the
year 1913 caused a large number of
The first
lord of the admiralty declared In the
house of commons In 1013 that the
armament of the vessels In question
was only to proteot them from dangers
threatening them from hostile ships

serve exclusively for defense.
"Experiences gained In the present
war show that a considerable number
of merchantment used the guns In
stalled aboard against hostile warships
and not solely with the Intention to es
cape exercise of the prize right but also
to attack and destroy enemy warships.
Government Inoites Illegal Acts.
"As is evident from the memorandum
which the imperial German government
today, communicated to neutral states,
instructions have been found aboard
British cruisers which prove that the
British government Itself inoited Brit
ish merchantment to illegal acts, and
thla in complete contradiction to assur
ances whieh it communicated to the
state department at Washing* m. Its
allies, particularly France and Italy,
fotleire-d~ the exti&jrie of Great .Britain
divlnr.thVcdtfrm of hostllltlea.
"Without wishing to enter Into an
examination of the surprising claim ad
vanced by the British government, ac
cording to which lihefs armed by that
government, retain their inoffensive
character, while merchantment armed
by the enemy are regarded by the
British naval forces as auxiliary cruis
ers^ the Austro-Hungarian government
limits itself to establishing that every
merchantman provided for any purpose
whatever with cannon loses thru this
fact alone the character of a noncom
batant ship.
Warning Neutral Nations.
"Under these conditions the order has
been given to the Austro-Hungarian
Indefinitely naval forces to treat such ships as com
as German batants—an order, which, however, will
be In force only from Feb. 29, 1916.
This delay In granted in the interests
of neutral powers, in order that they
may be .placed in it position to warn
their nationals of the danger to which
they will expose themselves if they en
trust their persons or property to armed
merchantmen of states at war with
Austria-Hungary, and also to notify
those of their nationals who may al
ready be aboard ships of the above
mentioned character.
"The ministry of foreign affairs has
the honor to request the embassy (or
legation) to bring the above to the at
tention of its government."
PLACES ENGLAND IN PILLORY.
Berlin' Newspsper Deolares German
Memorandum Has Unmasked Enemy.
Berlin, via London, Feb. 11.—The
Germanla, commening on the German
government's announcement that it In
tends to treat armed merchantmen as
warships, declares that It places Eng
land In a pillory before the world, and
continues:
"The manner In which England has
been unmasked by the publication of
the German memorandum Is more
striking than anything else heretofore,
made known. The British method of
warfare has been exposed as treatch
erous to' her enemies and to neutrals."
The Germanla asserts the course de
cided upon represents German's duty,
which must lead to a sharpening of na
val warfare. Responsibility for new
developments, it contends, will rest
uoon the British government alone.
