THE SHAME OF IT
l Ohio State Journul
m wo en mi- out of n leading theatre
where there wiih a inoviu show of mout
ii-i u I iful and taintless quality, we said to
llio manager, "Why eun't yon have u
show liku that all tho lime? Then) wus
not n ntuin on It from beginning to end.
He threw up his hands und suld ' ,dy
dear sir. If I kept up a show of this kind
for tlireojnonths 1 would break up. This
is not the kind of a show the people want.
They want murders seductions and dnub
le-loves. Why, If I had that sort of show
here today, instead of the clean one now
exhibited, ull the standing room would be
taken."
When we knew that the manager was
stating (he naked truth, we wondered iiow
such a thing could lie in a i lly of such
Intelligence, moral worth and iiinunier-
hle churches as Columbus Is. There
uihl be only one explanation and that
nn that all this intelligence, morality

is an imullf fence to the virtues of hlc
among people who ought to know better.
I lie re is an Ignorance ol the true values
of every-day living.
The managers of the sIkiw houses don't
want it this way. They are all intelli
gent, respectable and honest men. They
wish the people would tike only the clean
.-hows, for they would rather furnish that
kinrt. So, dear, pure, angelic creature,
when you blame the manager. better
blame yourself. And w hen the preachers

should jump Ohio themselves just as
hard. It is the good people or rather
the alleged good people that encourage
the tainted shows.

A telephone message from the parents

young son had died Wednesday and
ked that efforts to find the daughter

Cleota Hierholzer Is a daughter of Mrs.

Oxplanalioii of the young girl's disap

DRUG FIEND
Arrested at Toledo Giving Name
of Dee Miller, Believed to be
Doremni Wells
A man who suys he is Dee Miller, of
Celina was arrested in Toledo Saturday
by deputy internal revenue collectors and
w ill be held on a charge of peddling nar
cotic drugs. Several days ago the rev
enue collectors raided three places on
east Wayne street In Lima und found a
quantity of naroctics, altho the owners
of the dope could not be found. These
drugs were supplied by Miller, it was
said.
The Toledo authorities say that one
nan has supplied drugs nil over Ohio and
has extended his 'beat' to Chicago and
Canada. The sales in this state are
charged to Aliller, on whom they found
morphine which would have brought him
r0U the officers say. The drugs found
on Aliller were the first discovered In To
ledo for some time and the authorities
were of the belief that the drug habit
had been stamped out in that vicinity.
Since Aliller s arrest, jonn m. jviiuer,
Heimtv internal revenue collector In San
dusky, and Ralph Oyler and Charles H.
Gelst, special agents ior me loieuo um
triet. have been trailing AUIler's associa
tes. The trail led them to Wauseon, Sy
ivtinlii I tils eilv. and then back to To
ledo hotel, where they found $500 In
'checks' or small Dackages of morphine,
worth $1 each and a line set of scales for
weighing the drugs. Lima uany inows.
The foregoing article and similar write-
ups in the Toledo papers, have very Just
ly incurred the wrath of the real Dee Mil
ler, of this city, oldest son of Drayman
Pet Aliller, iind who for some time past
has been employed at the Tavern hotel
and restaurant.
It is understood here that the man un
der arrest at Toledo Is no other than the
shrewd Dremus Wells, with many aliases,
well known in police circles here and in
other cities over the country.
