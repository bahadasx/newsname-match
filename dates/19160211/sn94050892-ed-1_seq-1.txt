I nvcinai An nf fir-! v-5n- rt Om AAn
ducted Saturday Afternoon By Joint
committee or tmpioyees ana com
pany Officials.
A walk out of the employees of the
Detroit Copper Company at Morencl
In all operating departments, includ
ing smeltermen, miilmen, and miners,
occurred this (Friday) afternoon be
tween four and five o'clock.
Tne shut down was complete for a
few hours but at ten o'clock Friday
night it was announced that the men
would return to work on the se..
o'clock shift Saturday morning.
The wall; crt was tha result of the
refusal of Mine Foreman Chesterfield
to reinstate two discharged employees'
a Mexican and a Spaniard, members
of Morenci Miners Union, who had
been accused by a non-union miner,
an Italian, a late arrival from Ty
rone, X. M., but who had formerly
worked in Morenci, of employing
threats and, Intimidation against him
for accepting employment in the
Ryerson mine when former strikers
were still on the waiting list. '
' The Italian also accused the dis
charged men of coercion and intimi
dation in their efforts to have'-' him
join the union.
On Thursday the complaining Ital
ian reported the matter to Mine
Foreman Chesterfield and .the, two
men, pointed out by the complainant,
were suspended from employment for
fifteen days. The discharged' men
went to Superintendent of Mines,
Frank McLean, who upheld the' action
of the mine foreman. The inatt!j
was reported -to union headquarts
and shortly after three o'clock this
afternoon a delegation of union men,
accompanied the two discharged men
went to the Ryerson mine and demand
ed that they be reinstated.The demand
was refused. The employees in the
mine were then ordered out by the
executive committee and the mine
was closed down. A few minutes
later the men in the concentrator
and at the smelter were ordered out
and operations ceased.
, Vice President Donnelly was at Met
alf when he heard of the action of
the men at Morenci and hurried to
that camp. A meeting - was called
in the evening and after listening to
the grievance submitted Mr. Don
nelly advised the men to return to
work pending an investigation. The
aaaeiteniien' and mlHoaen left the hall
immediately and reported for ork
but It was decided not to resume
operations until seven o'clock Sat
urday morning.
At the meeting Friday night a com
mittee of three was also appointed to
wait on Manager Milton McLean.
Tha committee met Mr. McLean at
the general office of the .company the
same evening and an investigation of
the grievance wn:s promised, the in
vestigation to be started at four o'
clock Saturday afternoon, all interest
ed parties to be represented. In the
event that the charges preferred
.against (the two discharged men were
proven before the Investigating com
irittee their discharge was to be per
manent, otherwise they would be re
instated. Union men claim that no threats or
intimidation were used against the
Italian and that they were not af
forded an opportunity for a hearing
before Superintendent McLean at the
time they were discharged a
Speaking of the flare-up at Morenci
Vice President Donnelly, of the State
Federation of Labor, said:
"I am of the firm opinion that the
three mine managers of the district
meant every word in their statement
to employees issued on January 8,
'which statement was accepted in good
faith by the men on strike, and which
led to a resumption . of operations,
but day by day I have discovered that
the foremen, and bosses are not im
bued with the spirit of that agreement
and are practicing discrimination and
showing partiality between former
strikers, refugees and new comers,
which has been the principal cause of
friction and misunderstandings during
the past few days.
"The minor officials should under
stand that in order to secure harmony
between the employer and employee
there must at least be a tacit under
standing that the workers are pos
sessed of some rights and are deserv
ing of being treated in a tolerant and
forbearing manner. The bull dozing
tactics of former years must be
eliminated if the best results are ob
tained in the organization of modern
industry .
"I have now thirty grievance com
flaints which I have tabulated and
some of which I have personally inr
vestigated and found absolutely true
which I am holding in readiness to
present at the approaching conference

Miss Frances Thornton, popularly
called "Bunny," has sprung into prom
inence through her sensational driving
of speed cars on mile dirt tracks. Miss
Thornton is a Brooklyn girl and so
cially prominent in that borough.
ONLY 933 iLES OF
NEW RAILROADS
BUILT 11915
-Total - Mileage- In:;. the- Country is
242,000, of Which 28,661 Miles are
in Hands of Receiver. ''
In the United States in 1915 only
933 miles of new railroad were con
structed, as against 1,532 in 1914 and
3,071 in 1913. The total was the
smallest since 1864. - The longest new
construction for ' any one state was
Pennsylvania with 98 miles. There
are now about 242,000 miles of rail
road Ixa the whole country. Of this
38,C61 .miles were in receivership at
the close of the year. The statistics
have been ' compiled by the Railway
Age Gazette.
The number of freight cars built in
the year was 74,112, against 104,541 in
1911 and 207,684 in 1913, and the
number of locomotives and passenger
cars built " was smaller than In any
recent year except 1908.
Tne length -; of - railroads r in the
United States operated under the
block signal system on Jan. 1 of this
yew was 97,809 miles, an increase of
9,677 ' in the year. The - automatic
block signal mileage was 31,160, an
increase of 1,471 miles since" 1914.
Limiting of income by Government
regulation is blamed by the Railway
Age Gazette for the small expendi
tures for extensions and improve
ments, and it adds that the situation
is improving, owing to a change in
public and official sentiment toward
the reads.
The new railroad construction in
Canada last year was 718 miles, as
against 1,978 in 1914, and in Mexico
it was 36.5 miles as compared with
none in 1914.
oewoen the committees and the -managers,
and I am of the opinion that
this promised conference should be
held at the earliest date possible in
order that better relations may be
obtained between the employers and
thei? employees."
In conclusion Mr. Donnelly added:
"It is self evident that this district
cannot remain eighty per cent union
and twenty per cent non-union."
Shannon Mill Closed
On Thursday the concentrator and
leucher .at the Shannon plant were
ordered closed clown by General Man
ager P.enn:e when the foremen re
ported thai the men threatened to
walk out unless certain men, p?r
sona grata to the union, were dis
charged. The mines and smelter of
this company are still in operation.
Non Union Men Complain
Company officials state that non
union men daily complain that they
are made the siib'ect of assaults by
former strikers. That rocks are
thrown at the:r while on their ' way
to and from work and intimidating
methods are used in an endeavor to
induce tjem to jcin the union.

IT IS
FOUND IN FRISCO
THIS WEEK
Body of Baby Which Was Drowned
in Blue River With Its Mother on
January 16th Discovered After
Lapse of Twenty-Two Days.
The infant body of the girl baby,
nineteen months old, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Delia Reynolds, who with
its mother was drowned in the Blue
river on January 16th, was discovered
on Monday of this -week lodged in
the forks of a tree on the banks of
the Frisco river, forty miles ' below
the scene of the accident.
The body was discovered near the
Shannon pump station, was complete
ly dressed and showed very little
sign of bruises or mutilation as a
result of traveling such a long dis
tance on the crest of the river flood
which reached Clifton on the 19th.
Upon word being received in Clif
ton that the. body of the baby girl
had been found Arthur Slaughter and
J. C. G-atti went immediately to the
scene and brought it to Clifton. Fun
eral services were held at Pascoe's
Undertaking Parlors on Tuesday.
At the time of the accident Mr.
and Mrs. Reynolds, with their two
children, were traveling up the Blue
river on horseback . At a point three
miles below the Cosper ranch the
horse ridden by Mrs. Reynolds and
the baby, was washed off of its feet by
the high water and mother and baby
swept away in the flood before Mr.
Reynolds who was riding in advance
could render assistance. The husband
proceeded to the Cosper ranch where
a searching party was formed and a
few hours1 later the body of Mrs. Rey
nolds was found but continued seach
for the baby was futile. It is -remarkable
that after a lapse of twenty
two days the body of the baby was
discovered a few miles north of Clif
ton. .
Mrs. Reynolds was the daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. J. N. isaccs, of Ani
mas, New Mexico, who came here at
the time of the accident.
MINING COMPANIES
CONTRIBUTE TO
Generous Copper Companies Contrib
ute Over $100,000 to State Univer
sity. Copper companies operating in Ari
zona have generously contributed
over $100,000 for the construction of
a. school of mines at the State Uni
versity at' Tucson, and this handsome
sum is now available, and will be
added to the appropriation of $75,000
made- by the last legislature for this
purpose. '
The movement wa.s crystalized re
cently when the- Inspiration Cppner
Company of the Globe-Miami field
took' the initiative, and which wai
concurred in by three of the largest
1 producers in the State. Several others
joined, and the big fund will be ready
when desired. The contributing cop
per companies are now figuring out
a plan- by which to divide the sum of
$100,000, and which will probably be
apportioned on the basis of produc
tion of copper. As soon as the con
tributors can figure out just how
much each is to pay, which will not
require more than a few weeks, plans
for the building will be advertised
for. Dr. Von Klein Smid, president of
I the University, praised the fine boost
ing spirit snown Dy tne copper com
panies, mentioning especially Dr. L.
D. Ricketts, a member of the State
board of regents, and an authority on
copper mining.
- Dr. von KleinSmid also stated that
all of the big mining companies of
Arizona are very much interested in
the welfare of the university, and are
willing to help develop the mining
department by material aid. Although
the point was brought out In confer
ences that Arizona had not been quite
fair in enactment of laws to mining
companies, this question was not per
mitted to be injected into a general
discussion of the proposition and the
handsome fund was freely subscribed.
EXTENDING SOMERS SYSTEM
NOGALES For the purpose of In
stalling the Somers system of valua
tion. Tax Commissioners Thomas E.
Campbell and C. M . Zander are at No
gales. This system of valuation,
which is spreading rapidly throughout
the southwest, has been installed at
Phoenix, Tucson, Bisbee, Douglas,
Globe, Miami and Prescott. Its adop
tion at Flagstaff, Winslow and King
man is contemplated.
HIGH SCHOOL RIFLE CLUBS
PHOENIX Falling in line with oth
er schools of the state in the general
preparedness movement. Phoenix high
school is preparing to organize a rifle
club. Tucson, Bisbee, Benson and No
gales high schools already have rifle
clubs. Plans are on foot for the or
ganization of similar clubs at Prescott
and Winslow.

MINING ENGINEERS TO
CONVENE IN NEW' YORK
NEW YORK, Feb. 10. When the
112th meeting of the American Insti
tute of Mining Engineers convenes
here next Monday (Feb. 14) it is ex
pected that in addition to discussing
questions of vital importance to min
ing circles of the country the engin
eers will have before them the
y-hole question of military prepared
ness.. General Leonard Wood will
address one of the first meetings on
behalf of a Reserve Corps of Engin
eers to serve in time of emergency;
Secretary Daniels will co-operate by
sending the engineers around New
York harbor on a naval vessel; and a
letter has just been received from
President Wilson calling upon . the
engineers to aid in "organizing the
manufacturing resources of the coun
try ror a case or emergency.
' It is expected that next week's
meeting of the mining engineers will
be as vital, from the standpoint of
conistructive work, as any that has
yet been held. Some of the addresses
which are expected to excite a na
tionwide discussion among mining
engineers are Notes on Flotation, by
J. M. Callow; Substitutes for Plati
num, by F. A. Fahrenwald; and Me
tallography for Steel for li. S. Na
val Ordnance, by H. E. Cook.
There are at- present some 5,800
members of the Mining Engineers In
stitute and it is expected that a large
number of these will be in attend
ance. IRRIGATION COM MISSION--Wanted

GLOBE, Feb. 7. With the reckless

invaded the soft-drink emrjoriuma -
long Broad street Saturday; that is to
say those places that were formerly

KISSES COME
HIGH
IN KANSAS CITY
KANSAS CITY , Feb. 4. The Met-
tropolitan Street Railway Company
today under a settlement reached in
the .circuit court here, agreed to pay
Miss Evelyn Whittington, 16 years
old, $500 for a kiss administered by
one of the company's conductors.
Miss Whittington and her cousin
were the only passengers on a car
one night in January, 1915, she told
the court. . When, her cousin left the"
car. Miss . Whittington laughed be
cause her relative's descent from the
car steps was impeded by a tight
skirt. The conductor, too laughed. A
few blocks further on the conductor
kissed her, Miss Whittington de
clared. "Did you get hurt?" asked her at
torney.
"Well, he kissed me," came the an
swer. The young woman sued the com
pany for $25,000.
U is understoodthat the "Progres
sivo" committee's greeting to T. R.
as the first American and the fore
most statesman of the world found
the Colonel would be speedily unde
ceived if they'd go to Charleston and
try to get a drink.
