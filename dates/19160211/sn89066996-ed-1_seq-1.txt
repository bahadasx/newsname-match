The success of these proposed gath

St. Francois county, as such result
means the increase of interest in agri
cultural pursuits, which is the very
foundation of life's success. This pa
per believes that the people of the
county generally understand the pur

meetings sufficiently well to make each
gathering highly successful.
The meetings in this city will close
with a banquet on Friday evening,

W. T. Haile
W. T. Haile, the present incumbent,
is a candidate for re-election to the
office of County Treasurer, subject to
the nomination of the Democratic par
ty at the August Primary election.
Mr. Haile, who is so well and favorably
known throughout the county, needs
no commendation at our hands. Every
body knows "Tom" Haile, as ho is fa
miliarly called by his army of friends,
and that they will be glad to hand the
office to him again there is little doubt.
He has been faithful over the trust
imposed in him when the people elect
ed him, and has not only kept guai'd
over the county's strong box, but has
been uniformly courteous and accom
modating to all who had dealings with
the Treasurer's office.
Mr. Hailc is the scion of one of the
oldest and best families of this county
and a son of that venerable and be
loved old citizen, Thomas Harvey
Haile, now in his 96th year, and who
represented thi3 county in the General
Assembly of the State in his younger
days, so long ago that few now living
recall it. "Tom" appreciates the sup
port which his friends have given here
tofore and hopes that they will extend
to him aguin the favor of their sup
port for the Democratic nomination
of County Treasurer.
Will Karsch, who has been in St.
Louis for several years, has returned
to Farmington and will be associated
with the old established Karsch Shoe
Co. His furniture arrived this week
and they will go to house-keeping in
the east part of town.

CaughtThem Alive;
Covey of Ducks
Linn Clardy and Fred Isenman had
enjoyed the picture show last Wed
nesday night, dallied awhile at the
hotel and near midnight on their way
home strolled by the Post Office.
There, huddled in the door, they sur
prised a covey of wild ducks. The
ducks, possibly being tired out, may
have been waiting there to take up
their flight southward by parcel post
j Be that as it may, they flushed on the
j approach of Linn and Fred, who gave
i them chase and succeeded in catching!
I all five three hens and two drakes.
Don't smile and assume that this is
a joke, or that these young gentlemen
were indulging in some sort of a pipe
dream it's a fact. The ducks were
all run down by them and caught
alive, and they had them in a coop
Thursday morning as indisputable ev
idence of the strange catch.

Additional Plea for
dition for Every
and Child in
So much has been said in years
past about the very great advantages
of improved roads to every communi
ty, that The Times cannot believe
there is a normal man, woman or child
of school age but realizes, and to
some extent, at leant, appreciates, the
unspeakable comforts, conveniences
and advantages that well improved
roads would be to every community.
Therefore we are not going to at
tempt in the following to bring any
additional pressure to bear on the
subject of bettering road conditions in
St. Francois County, feeling as we do
that all have long since become con
vinced of the worthiness of the best
possible road conditions.
However, more as a reminder, we
feel that this is a most opportune
time to again bring to public atten
tion the lamentable condition of many
of the roads in this county, which is
very largely due to the recent higs j
water and flood conditions, that have
been general throughout the country, j
While the damage from high waters ,
have, perhaps, been greater this sea-1
Aon than usual, there is never a year j
passes but many country roads are I
made to suffer much from an excess of
Water, thereby causing damage even
the temporary repairing of which In
a very few years would pay the cost
of permanent good roads.
Does it not appeal to you that the
poll tax and all other moneys that are
now being, and have for years past
been spent in temporarily scraping
over and patching up the roads, has
practically been wasted? In fact,
would no, a few figures convince you
that the money that has been so spent
has, in reality, been worse than wast-!
ed, in view of our present knowledge
of permanent road work. Think of the
hard work that has been performed,
for instance, by the farmer, as well as
by the farmer'! team, in getting their

Old Place Sells
The John Carnell farm, perhaps bet
ter known as the old Burks place, six ;
miles northeast of Farmington, on the ;
Burks road, was sold Wednesday to
James Ryan, for $10,000, or $25.00 per
acre, there being 400 acres in the
farm. This is- one of the oldest set
tled places in this section of Missouri.

crops to market, especially when the
weather chanced to be bad (and of
ten when the weather is not bad, the
roads are.). All of which hard work
would have been eliminated with m
proved roads.
Would you like to know a feasible'
way in which to secure permanent
good roads throughout St. FrancoU
county T We would say, issue long
time bonds. In that way we people
now on earth would be enabled to en
joy the infinite pleasure that good
roads bring, and at the same time we
would not be called upon to pay the
total cost of same, but could hand
down to posterity a part of the cost
therefor, as well as the good roads.
Can you think that posterity would
have the slightest cause to conplain
at assuming a part of such burden, in
view of what they would inherit there
by? At this point there arc many off
shoots from the main question of good
roads, but over each off-shoot there is
a brilliant illuminated sign, which
reads PERMANENT GOOD ROADS.
One of these side-lines is that the
value of your lands would be largely
increased perhaps doubled great
saving of teams, wagons and vehicles,
comings and goings as your needs or
pleasure required. Would not these
things alone make it a splendid in
vestment to you for the almost infini
tesimal increase in your tax rate that
good roads bonds would levy upon
you? It is estimated that $500,000
will build 150 miles of rock road and
necessary bridges. Do you think that
would be too burdensome for St.
Francois c 'nty, with her large as
sessed valuation ?
All that The Times asks or desires
is that the property owners think
this matter over carefully. The best
interests of the people is what this
paper will always be found struggling
for.

Farmington people have learned to
look forward with keen anticipation
of pleasure to any concert given by
Barroll's Orchestra. This talented
organization plays music in a way
quite worthy of professionals or of the
orchestras in towns far larger than
Farmington. And with so excellent a
program as the one promised for the
14th, an overflowing house should,
and we believe will, greet them.
Mr. Wagner, of Columbia, Secretary
of the State Board of Charities, was

No. 4, where he was well entertained
and edified with an inspection of that
spelndid institution.
