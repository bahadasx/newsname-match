SMITH MAKES PUBLIC
STATEMENT OF CASE
High Life Blamed for Downfall of
Investment Board Clerk by
Friends.
BULLETIN.
St. Paul, Minn., Feb. 11.
Treasurer Smith is expected to
resign late this afternoon.
Friends say that although he is
not guilty it would be delicate
for him to continue under the
shadow. St. Paul, Minn., Feb. 11.Two in
dictments were returned by the Ram
sey county grand jury yesterday af
ternoon against R. C. Pickit, former
clerk of the state investment board,
charging forgery in the second de
gree in connection with the recently
discovered irregularities in the hand
ling of certain trust funds of the
state.
Three Secret Indictments.
Three secret indictments, under
stood to charge Walter J. Smith,
state treasurer, with first degree lar
ceny, were also returned.
Pickit has been formally arrested.
Bench warrants have been issued for
Smith.
Charged With Forgery.
Pickit is charged with forgery in
connection with two warrants on
school districts which were cashed at
the office of the state treasurer, Wal
ter J. Smith, after the endorsement
of the school treasurers had been
forged.
One was for $18,000, under date of
May 29, 1915, and the other for $6,-
000, under date of August 21.
Protests Innocence.
Walter J. Smith, state treasurer,
lying fn a bed in a room on the sec
ond floor of a sanatorium at 403
Seventh street south, Minneapolis,
late yesterday talked to a newspaper
representative. "I am innocent," he
said, "and, I can explain everything
satisfactorily. Take these warrants
for instance"
At this point G. C. Cardoff, a close
friend of Mr. Smith's, interrupted and
advised him to make no further
statement. "You are a sick man,"
he said, "and the physician has re
fused to permit you to talk."
Smith took the advice of Mr.
Cardoff. That he is ill is indicated
by his appearance. He is thin and
pale and his hands shook as he tried
to tell his story.
Not TtakJng "Cure."
Mr. Cardoff made the following
statement concerning Smith's condi
tion:
"Mr. Smith is not taking a liquor
cure. He is here because he is a
personal friend of mine. I have
known him for a long time and he is
under medical taertment for a con
dition bordering on a nervous pros
tration and pneumonia.
"I have talked over the matter to
some extent with him and I am sure
he can explain it. The public should
suspend judgment. He is in no con
dition to make a statement at this
time." SECOND SCANDAL
IN STATE OFFICE
This is the second time in the his
tory of Minnesota that a state treas
urer has been involved In a scandal
relating to alleged misuse of state
funds. In 1873 William Seeger, then
state treasurer, resigned while the
state legislature was preparing to
impeach him for alleged defalcation
of $180,000. It was shown that
Seeger was not at fault and the
shortage was made good.
PICKIT REPORTED
TO HAVE LIVED HIGH
"High life" is one of the causes of
the downfall of R. C. Pickit, say his
friends. He is 32 years old. Joy

SECRETARY OF WAR
GARRISON RESIGNS
FROMWILSON CABINET
Action is Due on Account of Dif
ference on Preparedness
Flans.
OPPOSED TO GRANTING OF
FREEDOM TO PHILIPPINES
Successor to Be Appointed Within
24 Hours, Report Officials in
Washington.
Washington, Feb. 11.Secretary
of War Lindlay M. Garrison resigned
late yesterday because President Wil
son would not "irrevocably" support
the continental army plan, and be
cause he opposed the administration
plan of setting a definite date for the
freedom of the Philippines.
President Wilson accepted the res
igation, but has not selected a suc
cessor. The president himself prob
ably will take personal charge of
the administration's national defense
plans in congress.
Assistant Secretary Breckenridge
also resigned as a mark of loyalty to
his chief, whose views he shared. The
president accepted his resignation.
Both take effect immediately.
Temporary Head.
Major General Hugh L. Scott,
chief of staff of the army, automatic
ally becomes secretary of war ad in
terim.
It is known that one of Secretary
Garrison's principal reasons for the
conviction that only a federal con
tinental army, instead of a reorgan
ized national guard should be made
the main military dependant of the
nation, was his belief that some day
the United States may be called up
on to defend the Monroe doctrine and
in that event, he says the prospect
is that the national guard not be
coming available fo ruse outside the
United States before a war declara
tion.
Upon the contention on -the one
hand that the continental plan which
meant ultimately universal service,
was the nation's reliance, _ancL the
position on the part of the president
that no one plan could be enforced
upon congress, President Wilson and
his secretary parted official company.
General Surprise.
Mr. Garrison's resignation was a
complete surprise to official Washing
ton geneally. He made no personal
explanation.
Several hours before the official
announcement, he had boarded a
train with his wife, for New York,
and word had been passed at the
department that he would be absent
indefinitely.
The acute differences of opinion
which led to the break began early in
the year, when opposition to the con
tinental army plan began developing
in ocngress. There had been inde
finite rumors of the possibility of the
secretary of war leaving the cabinet,
but they were never counteracted
in official quarters.
Was Strong Man.
The secretary everywhere was re
garded as one of the strong men of
the Wilson cabinet, upon whom the
president leaned in the difficult situa
tions both domestic and international,
which have marked his administra
tion. GARRISON THROUGH
WITH POLITICS
New York, Feb. 11.Former Sec
retary Garrison this afternoon made
the first statement since he resigned
from the war office. He stated that
he had quit politics and that he
would never take the stump against
Wilson. SUCCESSOR TO BE
NAMED IN 24 HOURS
Washington, Feb. 11.A successor
will be named to Secretary Garrison
within 24 hours. He will be a Demo
crat dark horse. None who have
been mentioned so far will really be
considered.

WHY CHANGE?
Mayor William McCuaig is
one of the most efficient execu
tives that Bemidji has ever had.
He has an excellent record and
has taken a commendable in
terest in the city's business. He
has well discharged the obliga
tions of his office. There is no
need in change of mayor this
year.
The Daily Pioneer endorses
Mayor McCuaig for re-election.
There is not a single good busi
ness reason why Mayor McCuaig
should be retired at this time.
He is the people's candidate. He
has by his past service to the
city earned the right to re-elec
tion and the people can choose
no better man next Tuesday
Why change?
Think it over.
Vote for Mayor William Mc
Cuaig for re-election.
ARMORY GRANT
UP NEXT TUESDAY
Bemidji to Petition for Building
Stillwater and Eveleth Also
Make Application.
St. Paul, Minn, Feb. 11.Build-
ing armories for Minnesota cities
will be the chief business before the
armory board, which meets at the
capitol Tuesday, Col. George C. Lam
bert, chairman of the state armory
*oard, told the United Press today
Gives $15,000.
A petition for building an armory
for the Bemidji division of the naval
militia is expected, he says. Accord
ing to state law, the local company
must secure a site suitable to the
board, and $1,000 or as much more
as the local company elects. When
the site and the money are accepted
the state adds $15,000 of its money
and the armory is built.
Few Hitches.
The process sounds simple. How
ever, there have been a few hitches
in meeting the letter of the law.
These instances may come before the
board also. One of these instances is
at Stillwater. Another involves an
interesting* situation at Eveleth, on
the Mesaba range.
"Mine Stops Building.
In this little mining town, the
local company of the state guard has
the site, the thousand and the de
sire for an armory. When the state
board examined the title, however, it
was found that the title was clouded
by mineral reservations. Under this
restriction, mining companies hold
ing the reservations could remove the
building on the site at any time.
Minnesota isn't raising armories to
be carted about, so the project balked.
There are forty armories in Min
nesota today. Col. Lambert said.
MUSICAL COMEDY
CAST IS NAMED
The cast of the musical comedy,
"Sinbad the Sailor," which will be
produced by members of the Episco
pal church next Thursday, was
