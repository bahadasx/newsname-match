WASHINGTON, Feb. 11. Former
Assistant Secretary ul War Breckin
ridge prepared a statement today ex
plaining his objection to building th
nation's military policy on the milrti'i
system. He condemned the system
not the personnel or the militia, but
declared the "most pernicious opposi
tion to the creation of a real national
force of citizen soldiers comes from
parsons purporting to represent the
rank and file Of the militia, but hav
ing selfish interests."
"In their effort tu conruse the pub
lic, they make believe the militia can
become a federal force. This pre
posterous er ha 1 will wllfuly fool tha
people Nearly every disaster of the
revolution and the war or 1412 was
due to dependence upon the militia
Washington's main dependence was
on the continental urmy, absolutely
under federal control. If any man
thinks an army should ne split intu
;n parts and separately governed, h
must believe the navy snould be di
vided in the same way." Hrecken
ridge said.
it is practically certain congress
will piusn the military pian on the
preparednt
and Cham

ause of the ap-
note from the president regarding the
' speech the secretary was scheduled
to deliver before the national chain
was decided upon suddenly Re
porters were receiving advance copies
of the speech Garrison Intended to
deliver when Garrison suddenly or
dered the speech stopped and an-
'Ynu should not feer any hesita
tion about expressing your personal
view of preparedness and Philippine
Independence, but 1 hope you will be
kind enough to draw very carefullt
.1 distinction between our IndJVtd
ual views and those or the adminis
tration." Immediately afterward Oarrlaon
and Breckenrldge conferred and sent
their resignations to the president
Garrison more keenly resented the
attitude of Hay than that of any
