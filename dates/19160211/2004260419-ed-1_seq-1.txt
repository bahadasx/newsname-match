LOCAL TEACHERS'
INSTITUTE
Teachers' Meeting at Iluiuier, Katur
luy, Jan. 2, 1910
About fifty ot the live teachers of
Columbia county assembled in the
new High School building at Rainier,
Saturday, for an all day session.
At meltings such as this, teachers
renew their professional batteries
charge themselves anew with energy
and determination to win as well as
give and receive plans that have been
tried successfully. ' Thus, they are
valuable both to the teacher new in
the work and to the experienced one,
who is liable to work in a groove. To
keep pace with progress in other vo
cations, teachers must plan to meet
new conditions.
The musical harmony of the pro
gram was furnished by the Rainier
High School quartet, a chorus of
twelve from tho eighth grade, and a
motion song by eight of Miss Bar
nett's pupils, who also gave a beauti
ful physical culture drill. In "The
Social Life of a Teacher," discussion
by J. H. McCoy, two classes of teach
ers were described who should
change their plans; the one who is
in the district only during school
hours, or as little as possible, and the
teacher who tries to do all and be
the social and religious center ot the
community. The first is of little so
cial value to the people, the second
Is apt to use too much of her energy
outside of school to do efficient class
work. Teachers and parents should
be in Intimate touch In order that
home and school conditions may har
monize. L. L. Baker reported a successful
organization ot teachers in a reading
circle at St. Helens.
Mrs. Bird B. Clarke described the
plan for hot lunch which she has in
troduced at Yankton, greatly to the
delight of the pupils and parents.
P. J. Kuntz, superintendent of
Rainier school, says that the devices
of corporations for saving time, are
valuable, and that the present teach
ing methods will become obsolete. If
a pupil knows a thing, why repeat it
In recitation? Better keep "busy" at
new work. Tell nothing to be un
learned. Call a noun a noun; be pre
pared to know and do things; pupils
should get something definite every
day, do something worth while; elim
inate worthless things.
L. L. Baker considers accuracy and
speed essential in arithmetic, especi
ally in reading problems. A pupil
should learn that two and three are
five and not count it. There is much
in our tests that is of no value to the
average child. The reasoning part of
a problem is four times as valuable
as the solution. Pupils must think
the relationship of the answers to the
given factors, state problems, and
test his own work. Problems in tests
should have the operations indicated.
"School Management." C. E. Lake.
The main factors in management are
efficiency and effort. Work should
begin the first day. School laws
should be enforced. Labor of other
kinds is specialized; that of teachers
must be. Plans for management vary
from mechanical organization to self
government.
L. F. Austin emphasized the idea
that athletics should be run for the
benefit of the pupils and not for the
purpose of winning games. Not all
pupils are primarily interested in
books; therefore, a proper use ot ath
letics may encourage good class work
and promote clean habits among the
boys.
II. E. Beck led the discussion in
history. The children should find
tho important points in the lesson,
and outline them. The toacber must
find out what the pupils should get
from the lesson and teach that. Il
lustrate events from the . experience
of some one if possible; also correlate
with current events. The reading of
historical books is Important and
credit may bo given for it.
Speaking on the subject "English,"
Miss Groshong endeavored to bridge
the gap botween the English as
taught in tho grades and High
School English. Pupils should have
a working knowledge of grammar,
should appreciate good literature,
and should have ability to express
their thoughts.
Supt. Allen supplied the other top-
FINED FOR KILLING
SONG BIRDS
l ined $20.00 and Cxmta and Gun is
Confiscated
James - Pooles, a Greek, was ar
rested Friday by Deputy Game War
den Brown on the charge of killing
wild birds and hunting without a li
cense. He was arraigned before
Judge Philip and fined $20 and costs,
which amounted to $3.85. Whether
he had the necessary coin or not is
not known, as he preferred to go to
Jail.
George Pappas, also a Greek, was
arrested for having a gun in his pos
session and the gun was confiscated.
It may not be generally known.
but according to the constitution of
the United States, a foreigner is not
allowed to carry fire arms of any kind
and the penalty includes both fine
and confiscation.
It is not tho intention ot the of
ficers of the game law to "cinch"
every violator, but their principal
aim is to prevent violation.
Alaska robins, also the native
robin, are very numerous and are
being well cared for. Some have
been trapped and placed in enclosures
and will be liberated. This is no vi
olation ot the law and is rather en
couraged. This also applies to the
sprightly little linnet that takes to
the cage like a canary.
SLOW, BUT SURE
Tho deep snow was too many for
the auto bus between the city and the
depot. J. H. Urie rigged up a bob
sled and with tour horses met all
trains sure and prompt. With the
melting snow when the runners cut
through, he resurrected the old bus
that did business In the days of yore,
and took care of the traveling pub
lic. The bus still bears the title ot
Morton & Stout.
ics of particular interest to teachers,
such as the placing of money obtain
ed from the land grant in the irreduc
ible school fund, thereby reducing
taxes; changes planned in the certi
fication of teachers; and the question
of holding the next annual Institute
in Portland in connection with Mult
nomah county and making it a joint
institute, for the reason that the
funds would be doublod and better
speakers could be obtained and a bet
ter program prepared. The teachers
present favored the plan. No action
was taken. Revoking of exemption
grades, attendance, truancy, tardi
ness, etc., were also taken up.
Not the least appreciated part of
the welcome given the teachers of
Rainier was the dinner and supper
served by the ladies of the Congrega
tional church in the basement of the
Methodist church.

HISTORIC
STORM
THE WINTER OF 1916
Sixty-Three Inches of Snow 87 Days
ot Storm
The great historic storm is over.
It continued from New Years until
Sunday, February 6, even Sunday
morning snow continued to fall.
The welcome Chinook came with
balmy breath Sunday forenoon and
the average Oregonlan wore a smile
that refused to blow off. Icicles
dropped from sagging wires by the
yard, and those who ventured out did
so at their peril. Icicles from build
ings endangered pedestrians but no
serious injuries resulted.
The awning in front ot George's
market, with its load ot snow, fell
with a crash and barely missed a pa
tron. The awning in front ot the
Llnvllle building was torn down as It
was a menace to the public. The
awning in front of Harris' is the only
one left in town.
While the mercury did not drop
as low as at some periods in the past,
the duration ot the storm holds first
place in the weather annals ot this
section. The fall of snow was exactly
63 inches by actual measurement.
Mr. John Philip kept a correct record
ot the fall and he is the authority for
the above statement.
The telephone and telegraph lines
Buffered heavy loss from broken poles
and wires. Tho loss ot the local
phone company of this city Is estim
ated at from $6000 to $8000. A force
of men have been at work all week.
A gang of the Pacific Telephone Co.
were here Sunday assisting in the
work.
The shipbuilding plant was unable
to work for just one week. The big
mill is shut down undergoing repairs,
but the little mill whistle announced
activities Monday morning.
In the hill country the snow ranged
from three feet to six and those com
munities were virtually "holed up."
However, stock suffered but little
and the loss to farmers was slight.
' Business In town was reduced to a
discouraging point but since the
weather clerk has adjusted matters
to a normal period, business has In
creased. Wood was at a premium and sold
for $4.60 per cord and not a very big
cord at that. As the mill was shut
down this source of wood supply was
therefore cut off.
Snow from roofs and porches had
to be shoveled off to prevent damage.
The interior of the Masonic hall Is
almost ruined from leaks and a new
roof will be necessary as soon as the
weather will permit.
The business portion ot the city
was in darkness only two nights fol
lowing the silver thaw. Others had
to resort to coal oil lamps and
candles. The suppTy of candles only
lasted a few days.
Orchards suffered greatly as many
trees were broken down entirely and
others almost ruined. English wal
nut trees being naturally "branchy,"
could not uphold the heavy coating
of ice and went crashing to earth.
