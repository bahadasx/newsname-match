CARRIZOZO, LINCOLN COUNTY. NEW MEXICO. FRIDAY. FEBRUARY II. 1916
FHICE $1.50 PER YEAH
TOWN HAS ENJOYED
STEADY GROWTH
Many Substantial Hcsidcnccs
and Important Business
Houses Have Boon Erected
Here in Past 18 Months
CRYING NEED OF AN ORGAN
IZED CITY GOVERNMENT
As for buck as wo can remember
Carrizozo ling been stoadlly unsmil
ing proportions-befitting a llttlo city
uf modern cullbro. I'erlmps there
was a time when Carrizozo could
havo been said to be a boom, when
slio emerged from tho shadow of
her present self Into an important
, railway dlviaiou point nnd becamo
tho logical countyseat, not because
-of a central location in Lincoln Co
but becnuso of its eaav access to
outside points and its superiority
lit all modern conveniences. This
ye should be justified in calling a
boom,, but the stonily substantial
growth which has characterized
Carrizozo'é development, both In
.the business and residential section
since tills stage In nor history, we
rcfuso to classify as a boom.
boom means a sudden nnd spasmodic
ferowth, and although there have
'.b&n no less than two or three ro
.-sidences In process of construction
at all times, the town's develop
mm- h .M liffu p mili.ir it. H coii
jeistent steadiness.
.. Tlie loiiowing aro among woe

months built residences which would
'do credit to any community; Ed

.remodelling has greatly improved
fhYir appearance both Internal nnd
external; Among. -those now under
process ot construction ,nra tifo root
pottages of Mrs, Chas. Jones and
f)an Tiffany and this form of acti
vity is not confined to any one
section of town
' Important business building has
lioeu dono in the erection of (ho
spacious' b'üjíding now occupied by
(ho. Western .Garage, tho modern
room occupied by Fatty & Hbbbs,
Zlegler Druthers' new building,
doubling their former space, Kelley
d Son's new sporting-good da
partmont, and many other improve
Bitnts without and within, .such ns
, the new awning nnd conorete bIiIb
walk in front of the Carrizozo Trad
ing Co,, n substantiel enlargement
of the buslnevs facilities of Hum
phrey Bros, nnd others too numer
diis.to mention.
What doen It all mean? The
answer Is easy. Level-headed busi
ness men prosperous ranchers nnd
thrifty railroad operatives have the
place alzed tip as a good one one
which they evidently believe is a
good place to invest their pite.
iien It appeals to men of every
Ik of Ufe, and tho growth has
this steady coiiBorvotlvo basis upon
which to operólo, thuro ia no use
talking the growth Is bound to con
tlnuo Indefinitely. Tlioro aro too
muny different interests centered In
Carrizozo for It to evor bo dependant
lor its exlstonce upon any one in
dustry, nnd tlioso towns which nro
so fortunuto as to feel this inde-
pendenco from tho caprico of for
tuno aro few and far botweon.
It Is tho merest folly or n full-
flodgod burg like Carrizozo to drift
nlong any longor without an organ
ized city government. Tho time
Is ripe for article? of Incorporation
to bo drawn up and duly parsed.
No business man ofnuy significance
will longer oppose tho movement

Docks nona. Ulvo too town n sure
enough chanco by giving it tho city
govorment It has long deserved and
watcli It prospor as it lias never
done befora.

DEFINITE PENALTY SHOULD

Last Sunday evening as tho shades
of night were falling, for they fall
with a thud sometimes on dark
towns; tho objective point of three
disgruntled hoboes was ovidenllv
tho office and resldonco of Dr. It.
T. Lucas, immediately adjoining
the business district of Carrizozo.
The transients made sevoral ap
proaches to the aforemontloned
premises passing and repassing ths
houso ropoatodly, finally hanging
out on Hie approach to the Fire
Department, apparently waiting
tho oxpco'cd departure of the family
to evening worship. Hut a counter
plot develops for tho dOclnr grdws
less and Ipss religious and more and
more suspicious. Deputy Sheriff
Uaird is summoned, cooks hiking
to the spot, nabs tho Willies, giv.es
them a night's lodging in tho county
jail, with orders to loavo fobvn
