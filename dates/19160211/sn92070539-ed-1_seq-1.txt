Our Delightful Climate
We often hoar people talking

dry season. There mny or may
not lie something in some or all
of said signs; but we do Itnow
there is evidence of u mild winter
when oeoplo hutch chickens

to the world that we have the
nicest climate known to man
kind. Many have eggs in incu
bators, and we Itnow 'several who
have hot beds und seed planted
in them now.
It is ii fact Unit we liuve mild
winters. We do not liuve extreme
summers. Wo who have lived
hero for a number of years, for
get the zero weather of the north
that we used to iudure, und the
oppressive heat of nlmost any
other state of the union. There
are thousands of piople in differ
ent states of our union that work
ull summer to prepare feed und
fuel for the winter which lusts
for from four to seven months.
Here, as all of our residents
know, stock lives all winter on
the grass, on the prairie. Many
Many a family has not burned
for fuel a ton of coal or Its value

Dabney For Road Commissioner
A petition praying that Dr.
T. II. Dabney bo upixiinU'd a
member of the Luna county road
board wus sent to Governor Mc
Donald llrst of the week. Mr.
llunth is n member of the board
but is willing to resign in favor
of tho Doctor. Tho petition wus
signed by u large number of the
residents of the vulley and no
doubt will be given duo consid
eration. A mass meeting was held for
thepurposuof naming u candi
date und und the result of tho
meeting about proved that Dr.
Dubny hud more enemies than
nny man in the valley, und he
Is to bo tho goat. It takes a
broad and liberal minded man to
accept a job of this kind, which
has a great deal of work attached
and no compensation, not even
expenses. Dr. Dabney was the
unanimous choice of the people
and tho Courier does not believe
a better man could bo found.

DRILLING A
Columbusj
To The Property Owners of The
Mimbrcs Valley:
Whereas, R. W. Elliott now has his well
rig at work sinking a deep well with the idea of
finding artesian water, and the expense of same
being too much for one man to bear when the
outcome of the drilling will benefit one property
owner as much as another, efforts are being
made to raise funds to assist him in the under
taking. The residents of the Valley arc all
donating very liberally, and we feel that those
who do not reside here but own real estate
should feel equally interested and should be
willing to help.
The cost of the well will be several thous
and dollars, and donations arc solicited in any
amount you may be able to give, and the depth
of the drilling depends upon your liberality.
Donations will be received by J. L. Greenwood
of the Columbus State Bank, and must be made
in cash or check.
Very Respectfully,
J L. Greenwood

hope of striking tho .nmo body
of wuter und in larger quantities.
Mr. Elliott Is asking for a small
amount of help in sinking the
deep well, nnd the business men
of Columbus nnd others arc
taking un interest und there
sonms to be no doubt that he
will receive what ho has request
ed. However, if tho nssistanco

A. C. Peterson was looking
after business interests in Col
umbus Wednesday.
Work on tho road south of
Doming bus been completed for
about thirteen miles. Last
Thursdny it was rumored that
a new road was to bo laid out on
the way to Columbus, cast nnd
west over the slope of the Tros
Hermunns mountains and go a
couple of miles south ot Waterloo,
so a number of our good looking
farmers hurried to Doming to
tell tho honorable road board
what they thought of being left
out in the cold cruel world. Wo
certainly hope they put up a
good argument for we don't in
tend to buy any thirteen cylinder
otomobil till our principal street
Is worked some. Just a Utile
work on thorn, and a conorote
ford ovor tho draw in the gap
is all we ask for tho prosont, for

Hey There Guy!
I moan you who have not yet
paid your subscriptions. Wo
have ovor $1100 duo us on sub
scriptions. You owo $1 .50 nnd
the fellow ovor here owes $1.50.
There are a largo number of
you and sonding statements to
all involvos n big expense, when
you pass them up from time to
time, wo nlmost bogin to doubt
your honesty. It costs money
to print a paper and credit alone
will not nlways buy white paper.
We try our best to give you your
money's worth, and we believe
that you should bo as fair toward
us as wo try to be towurd you.
Now these accounts uro small
und will not nffect anyone serious
ly nnd they moan much to us.
If you do not think tho paper is
wort tho money pay up nnd stop
it. But pny up any v;ay.
Church Attendance Increasing
We have noticed with much
satisfaction the very greatly
increased attendance at church
for the past 'ow Sundays. It is
most gratifying to those
connected with church service,
to see the church well filled at
every service. The Epworth
League is a very valuable acjunct
to the church people, and wo
would urge all those who really
have the tho religious welfare of
our town at heart to attend this
service and help out thosn wh
are laboring so faithfully to sus
tain it's interest. It can b
made of such intense and vital
Interest, if we have the coopera
tion of all church goers, bus it
must bo weak where only u few
have to bear tho burden of it's
support. Come out, everybody
and tako a part in this interest
ing Iseivke, m.d jou will eniii
by it yoursolvos, nnd aid tho
faithful workers.
Go-Tc-Church-Day
It has been decided by the
churches here to make Sunday,
March 5th, an Everybody-go-to
church, day". There was a sug
gestion of it in last week's Corn
ier, and in this issue we wish to
announce it as a certainty. Let
everyone in the entire commun
ity come out to church on that
day, and we think there will bo
much surprise at the size of tho
crowd which can be assembled
in Columbus, when there is n
"will".
Wo most cordially invito our
Waterloo neighbors to come and
join in with us, and most earnest
ly solicit the attendance of all
the ranches in tho vicinity of
Columbus.
Rev. J. A. Land will preach
in tho morning at 11 o'clock and
Rev. C. H. Boddmiiwn in tho
evening at 7;!10 o.clock. There
will bo special music at both
services.
