Election Bills Ar6 Prncu Com-
plcfipd in n Stormy Scsslo. of tlio
Democratic Members. Tho Usury
Bill Socms to Ijo About "Defunct."
Another joint session of the Demo
crats of the Houso and Senate was
bold at Oklahoma City Wednesday,
and an address by Governor Williams
-was the feature of tho occasion, and
perhaps the foature of the entire ses
sion of; thtTsolona. It Is understood
ihnt tho election mcasurots are now
couiploted, nil but tho primary, olec
tlon bill, 'Which Is now under consid
eration by both branchos. It Is now
thought probable that tho Governor
will submit tho election question in
a message after tho caucuses shall
have completed their labors. The cau
cus Wednesday waa a Btormy session
"and tho talks aro Bald to have been
vory frank. Governor Williams made
It very plain to the Democratic law
makers that they have tho responsi
bility and that they must act. His
determination not to approve a ses
sion of more than thirty days has nut
wavered, but there Is now a prospect
for tho Legislature remaining in ces
sion until, about February 19, "which
will be threo"or four days more than
thirty.
Tho registration law, the amend
ment to tho constitution limiting
suffrago, and a primary election law
that will not vary much from the
present statute aro oxpected to be in
troduced as soon as a message from
tho. Governor shall com authorizing
consideration of the election ques
tion. Tho ribbon baUot Beems to
have been lost in tho caucus. It was
subject to much debate, and tho op
position lasted longest.
, Tho Houso amended tho Glasco us
ury bill before recommitting to a
committee for redrafting to an ex
tent that ls snd to be vcry "Well like
the present ineffective law. Judge
Glasco was ready to move that fur
ther consideration of the bill be post
. poned indefinitely, but ho could not
got an opportunity. His idea of the-
amonded bill may be gathered from
his-attitude. This action by the
House seems pretty clearly to indi
cate that no real usury legislation Is
tq bo had at this session.
Rumors that friends of the usury
bill wiirrotalinte byrofualns to (sup
port any election law seemed to be
justified when several Democratic
representatives who have considered
if -usury tne most important issue in
tno senate waiKea out or me caucus
and did not participate. One of them
said that tho killing of the Glasco
bill will be1 tho death-knell of tho
Democratic party qouth of tho Rock
Island Railroad In Oklahoma.
Debate in tho House on tho usury
question was marked by frankness
of expression on the parts of Repre
sentatives who defended the collecy
tion of usury by small banks and
their assertion that If these banks
raust obey tho law as It is written,
there are hundreds rqf small cities
that will have to do without banks.
One o fthese speakers was Mr. Acton
of Logan another -was Mr. Hudson of
Tulsa, Mr. Durant of Bryan seemed
bold similar views, '
An, adverse report was made in tho
Houso an the senate bill that -repeals
the law prohibiting sale of narrow
tired wngonB after this year. A mi
nority report saxed the moasuro for
the calender.
A letter from former Lieutenant
Governor McAlestcr was read in the
Senate. It protested vigorously
against establishing a binder twine
f-.cto.ry at thp State "penitentiary on
tho ground that It would be opposed
by a big trust and that It wduld as
suredly be a losing venture. It was
suggested by Mr. McAlester that tho
-Stato establish- two fertilizer factories
that would employ nB many men and
do .as much good for the farmers. I
Attention waa called to tho fact, by
s6nator Barnott, that many tele
grams and other messages of this
kind had boon rocolvod from hard
ware firms opposing the twine prop
o8itlou, and It was suggested that
there Is a possibility of these having
beofl Inspired by this same big trust
Toforred to.
Tho Senate adopted tho minority
report on the gross production tax
bill which was mado by Mr, Russoll
of Muskogee. It provides scope for
the'' State Board of Equalization to
K !ncroaco tho assessments on Hielr
awn motion. Mr. Russell then of
fered an amendment to make tho tax
3 per cent instead of 2, and that the
extra 1 per cent bo returned, to tho
counties producing the tax. Tho iblll
was roferred to a special committee
tforv redrafting,

BONDS MET READY SALE
Tuesday, during the regular meet
ing of the County Commissioners,
tho $25,000 worth of bonds rccutly
voted by the citizens of Township 9
of this county, were sold to tho firm
of Spltzer, Rorlck & Co., of Toledo,
Ohio, bringing par, accrued Interest,
and a premium of $850. There were
representatives of eight other bond
buyers present nnd wanting to gotUne township, and persons having to

Only. two bids woro proposed. The

Sam'i Rose, representing the success
ful bidders, was 103Vj. Several

ground, and had been here for 6ev-
oral days, but filed no bids. After
the time advertised for tha closing
of the bids had arrived, and tho bids
received had been opened, three rep
resentatives of othor bond buyers,
It Is believed deliberately attempted
to ball up tho record of the proceed
ings, by proffering at that late date
to file thelftblds, which they were not
permitted to do, and which could not
havo been permitted If the records
were to do kept straight. The bidders

GIVE NAMES TO
THE TOWNSHIPS
Bt-ynn County to Have Eleven, in
Place of Twelve Municipal Town
ships ns Heretofore. Other Pro
ceedings of Commissioners.
Ono of tho most important pieces
of business transacted by tho Coun
ty Commissioners, in session this
week, was tho redisricting of the
municipal townships of tho county,
and giving them names by which
they will bo known in tho future'
Lack of time and space precludos tho
detailing of the boundaries of each
of the townships In this issue, and
the complete resolution will probab'ly
bo glvoa space noxt wook.
Tho prinolpal object of tho Com
mlsslonerB, according to their state
ments, is to facilitate tho work of
getting to tho voting boxes on the
part Of many people in several parts
of the COunty, who, on account of
the peculiar arrangement of the var
ious townships, woro many of thein
forced to go miles out of their way
to voto at tha polls where they worfe"
entitled to oast their ballot. One
township, that around tho town of
Blue, has beon completely absorbed
in other townships.
Townships formerly known by
their numbers, have been given
names as follows: TownShlp Ono Is'
now Bennington Township; Town-
Bhlp Two, Matoy Township; Town
ship Three, Bokchlto Township
Township Four, Cado Township ',1
Township Five, Spealrs Township;
Township Six, Brown Township;
Township Seven, Colbert Township;
TownBhlp 8, Komp Township; Town
ship Nine, Calora Township; Town
ship Ten, Albany Township. An ad
vantage In naming the townships is
the (act that the name, in most cases,
is taken from the largost town In
know the location of a township, Vrtll
know at onco from the name In what
part of the .county this particular
township is located.
Aside from this matter, and the
selling of the road bonds of Town
ship Nine, nothing 'was taken up by
tho Commissioners outside of the reg
ular routine of monthly business.

CRUSH PEANUTS ON LARGE

An article In the Greenville Ban

that the Greenville-Cotton Oil Coni
pany will next year go Into the bus
iness otcrushlng peanuts on a large
scale, selling the oil to packers for
food products, and the resultant cake
or meal for feeding purposes.
The Durant Cotton Oil Mill Com
pany of this city successfully crush
ed peanuts the past season, and
found a ready market for the oil, and
the cake and meal. It was an exper
iment on the part of the local com
pany, but Mr. W. F. Pendleton, man
ager of the company, says the ven
ture was entirely successful. So far
as Is known, the local company Is the'
first cotton oil company In the world
to work up peanuts on a large scale
with cotton mill machinery. Next
year Mr. Pendleton plans handling
tho nuts on a gigantic scale, and as
Burse the farmers of a ready market

r
TOO MUCH LEGISLATURE,
SAYS GOVERNOR WILLIAMS
Fnvor.4 Meeting Only Onco Each Year
nnd Then Only for Thirty Days,
Only Necessary Legislation,
' .'
Governor R. L. WilliasniifdciroBS-
ed tho Ministerial Association at Ok
lahoma City Tuesday and spoke of
the functions of government, telling
of somo of the troubles of the State
Government. He said that the main
trouble is that there is too much Leg
islature. That Governor Williams
has come to more fully believe this
since he convoked tho present ex
traordinary Besslon is generally be
lieved. "I advocate a law which will per
mit the meeting of the Stalo Legis
lature but onco a year," said the Gov
ernor, "and thon but for thirty days.
Onco in ten years, I would permit a
long session. During the short an
nual sessions such legislation as is
necessary could be enacted. During
the decennial term such of the laws
as had proven unsatisfactory could
bo repealed. A Legislature will pass
a good law once In a while, and often
before it has had time to prove its
worth it is repealed. I have given
much thought to the Ideas which I
advocate In this connection, and I
am cinvlnced that their adoption
would result In, better government
than we now have."
Tho Governor also discussed ' the
educational system of the Stato, the
penal system and the judiciary. The
judiciary, education and legislation
are the three most Important sub
jects in his opinion that confront the
State.
Discussing the penal system, Gov
ernor Williams said:
"As a part of our educational sys
tem I Include our Stato penitentiar
ies and institutions. My hobby is
the State asylum at Norman and the
State penitentiary at McAlester.
Whenever I can snatch off a few mln
utesfrom my work I visit one of the
two.
"And It Is my delight to tell any
of the 2,000-or more' inmates of the
McAlester penitentiary with whom I
nnma In o'nntnnt ffl ttiocxoi vlaltfl Hint
them. They must release themselves
by showing their own ability to
work and their willingness to sup
port the"mselves decently and hon
estly after they ledve the prison
Avails.
''I believe in paroling and pardon
ingprlsonerr" worthy rijfoners.
There Is nothing that gives me more
gratification than ito be able to lib
erate one of the unfortunates who is
compelled to spend his days within
tho gray prison wallB. I think that
the example of that convict's winning
his way back to freedom by his own
efforts encourages his felows to live
a better life.
"Then there Is the question of tax
es which conironts me as it con
fronts every State executive. I re
ceive letters every day from men in
other States with capital to Invest,
asking me why taxes in Oklahoma
are so high. I always reply that Ok
lahoma Is a new State, a baby State.
We have problems of building and
construction before "us that long since
have been solved by the older States.
Taxes are high In Oklahoma, but we
aro building out hore on the prairies
a magnificent commonwealth."
Tho Governor lauded denomina
tional schools and asserted that there
are too few of them and possibly too
many State Institutions of higher
learning. He continued:
"Ab the head of our State educa
tional system I am very proud of
what we have dono. We have ar
ranged things so as to have at least a
five-month term of school In evory
county In tho Stato, and eight and
nine-month terms In the majority.
But we have too few denominational
schools, and in any movement which
you gentlemen and the churches you
represent make for tho establishment
of schools I will heartily support as
long as I am Governor of Oklahoma."

In his talk, tho representative Gald:
"Our pooplo are in the gas business.
If a suitable franchise can be secured

LUSITANIA case is
NEARING SETTLEMENT
The latest Information from offi
cial "sources In Washington is to the
effect that tho Lusltanla matter Is
at last nearlng a settlement. In fact
that It is already practically settled,
though formalities have yet to be ob
served n finally closing the matter.
High government officials consider
that this government In prevailing
upon Germany to make the conces
sions and agree ments that are set
forth in tho document, has achieved
recognition of all the high principles
for which It has contended In con
nection with submarine warfare.
While the substance of tho pro
posed communication admittedly is
satisfactory, minor changes to clarify
the wording and In connection with
tho form which tho formal document
will take have been, suggested t to
Count "Bernstorff, the German Am
bassador, by Secretajry LanBlng.
--The situation may be summarized
in the following 'statement-made by
an administration official:
"A settlement of the LuBllanla
case is in sight, probably within tho
next few days. Tho United States
has not increased Its demands; It has
not reduced them. You can draw
your own conclusions as to the basis
of tho agreement. Tho wording pro
posed by Germany appears to cover
the position of tho United States. It
is not fair to assume that tliere win
be any further admissions or conces
sions from Berlin."
BELIEVE WILSON WILL
HAVE NO OPPOSITION
President Wilson will- be renom
inated without opposition, Is the con
census of opinion of the subcommit
tee of the National Democratic Com
mittee, which met In St. Louis Tues
day to arrange details for the Demo-
cratlc national convention.
The committee was not so certain,
however .that Vice President Mar
shall would be renominated,
The committee did not select a
temporary chairman, and this will
probably not be done until May. Sen
ator James . Reed of Missouri is
being discussed as a possibility for
this Important position, tne comnui
teo thinking It .fitting that the tem
porary presiding officer should bo
chosen from the State In which tho
convention Is to be held.
OPPOSITION TO LOUIS BRANDIES
Tho President of the United States
paved tho way for a row when he
nominated Louis D. Brandies, the
eminent Boston lawyer and econo
mist, for position on the bonoh of the
United States Supreme Court to take
tho place of Justice Lamar, deceased.
to'or the first time m nisiory, mw
Senate has conducted a public in
quiry as to Brandies' fitness, and
many prominent people havo been
called on to testify. Much testimony
has boon presented to show that
while Brandies was counsel ror me
Interstate Commerce Commission, he
gave way to the railroads on many
important points whloh ho could eas
ily havo avoided.
SENATE PASSES COAL

policies of Governor Williams In thla

corded In a roll call, occurred Tues-"
day evening when tho Senate passed
