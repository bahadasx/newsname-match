Gates let Down for New Members
For Next Six Months.
Three hundred members, all brim
ful of "peo" and ginger, up on their
toes and ready to push to a successful
conclusion any project that makes for
a bigger and better Caldwell is the
mark set for the membership com
mittee of the Commercial Club.
The club at their regular monthly
meeting decided to set aside for 60
days the initiation fee of $10 and al
low members to come in free of cost.
There are many who will make ex
ceedingly valuable workers who do
not care to pay out the fee and it is
the intention of the club to get them
all. .#
Members of the club will wear a rib
bon and woe be to the man who ap
pears in public without the color of
loyalty in his buttonhole.
Considerable matter of unusual im
portance came up for consideration
and was disposed of either by action
of the club or by reference to com
mittees.
Caldwell-Winnemucca Highway.
A letter from the Jordan Valley En
gineering Co. was read asking for the
active co-operation of the club in wag
ing a fight for an interstate highway
connecting Caldwell and Winnemucca,
passing through the rich and prosper
ous Jordan Valley country. The club
was urged to get the matter before
our representatives in Congress thai
they help push a bill to be introduced
calling for an appropriation of about
$300,000 to build the road,
The matter was referred to the
highway committee by President Zeh
The club was of unanimous opinion
that this road would be of inestimable
benefit to Caldwell,
Astoria presented their claims as
the only proper and fitting site for a
naval base of the first class on the
Pacific Coast and asked that the club
endorse their contention. On the mo
tion of T. S. Jackson the letter was
tabled.
Club For Preparedness
A resolution placing the club on
record as favoring an adequate pro
gram of preparedness and federaliz
ing the National Guard, making them
part of the first line defense, was pass
ed on a rising vote of the club.
Resolutions.
Whereas, at this time there
question which occurs with force to
the citizens of the United States as to
whether or not this nation is adequate
ly prepared for defense, therefore
Be it Resolved, by the Commercial
club of the city of Caldwell, State of
Idaho, that it does herebv place it
self on record as strongly favoring
the action by the Congress of the
United States which will insure the
following:
First: An efficient and larger navy.
Second: An increase in the regu
lar army that will insure the proper
preparedness of our nation in keeping
with our form of government.
Third: The adoption of such legis
lative measures as will improve the
efficiency of the national guard and
make- it available with the regular
army for a first line force.
Fourth: Practical provisions for a
system of reserves for the régula
army, navy and national guard.
Fifth: The organized militia under
the constitution as a part of our fed
eral military system should be the
basis for forming any force of citizen
soldiers. This action should be taken
from the standpoint of economy a
well as efficiency for the reason that
the several state* and nation have
expended millions of dollars in train
ing and equipping the national guard
Regular army officers support the con
tention that the national guard or
ganizations, as they exist today, are
efficient. Therefore, it appears that
the most feasible plan to secure »
force of citwenry trained in arms is to
give more federal aid to our present
militia organizations.
Be it further Resolved: That copies
of these resolutions be sent to the
President of the United States, the
Secretary of War the Chairman of
the Committee on Military Affairs of
the Senate and House, and to the sena
tors and representatives in Contres»
from this state, and that the latter be
speedily urged to use their best en
endeavors to accomplish there results.
The Weiser Commercial club con
sider the telephone rentals much too
high and asked that the club join
them in bringing the matter to the
attention of the public utlities com
mission. It was presented that the
commission lacked funds to make the
necessary investigations, and that sev
eral of the towns of this section could
well combine and raise the money
necessary—some $3,000.00—to procure
the data. The letter was referred to
the publicity committee.
Hon. John C. Rice read a very
comprehensive report on two bills now
before congress: the Ferris bill, pro
viding for the leasing of hydro-elec
tric sites, and a bill providing for the
leasing and title to certain mineral
and oil lands. The club went on re
cord as favoring the passage of these
bills and gave Mr. Rice a vote of
thanks for his report.
be
..... rc PO „.
W, G. Cowden reported that the
business men of the city had estab
lished a credit system patterned after
the Weiser system. The idea of the
system is not to draw credit lines
tighter, or in any way attempt to es
tablish a bill-collecting agency, but to
establish a plan whereby farmers
could enjoy a much larger credit, with
entire safety to all concerned, than
is possible under the system at pres
ent in vogue.
Mr. Cowden also reported the mat
ter of sanding of Johnson lane.
The Federal Building.
Walter Griffiths spoke of the mat
ter of bringing the necessity of an
office here for the fiduciary agent of
the p-overnment project, as well as the
project manager, to the attention of
Congress. If this office is thought of
in connection with the postoffice
building, Mr. Griffiths pointed out
that it would take the building out of
the regular class of postoffice build
ings and materially hasten action by
Congress.
Messrs. Wood, Mitchell, Kelly,
Kingston, Eldridge, Graceland, and
others, of Riverside, were present and
addressed the club, wishing them
God-ipeed in the matter of electrify
ing the Wilder branch, and asking
that the influence of the club be used
with Mr. Sebree that their section
be tapped in the near future. River
side is a very valuable adjunct to any
town, not only because of material
wealth but on account of the person
nel of its inhabitants, and the club
assured the representatives that they
would help in any way possible.
The Wilder Branch.
W. L. Hasbrouck, W. A. Stone and
Mr. Jordan spoke of the Wilder
branch. The meeting at Wilder Mon
day evening was enthusiastic and the
subscriptions were coming in satis
factorily. The members of the club
were urged to welcome the subscrip
tion committee when thev called and
be prepared to do their part without
wasting much time.

The meeting indicated that the best
of feeling prevailed among the Re
publicans of Caldwell. The speakers
stated that the former Progressives

Newspaper Aritcle Not Libelous.
The demurrer filed by the defend
ants, Drs. W. C. Hurd and A. V.
Strauss, in the case of which J. Wei
don is plaintiff, has been sustained by
District Judge Bryan. Berry brought
action against defendants for $50,000
damages, which he alleged he had
sustained as the result of an article
in Payette newspaper, which stated
that Berry had refused to turn over
$70 for tickets he had sold on a raffle
of an automobile, the proceeds of
which were to go the baseball team of
that city. Berry, who is a buyer and
shipper of poultry, was mentioned in
the article as Payette's heavy chicken
buyer. The plaintiff must now prove
that the aiticie was libelous.

CALDWELL HIGH SCHOOL
TO EMPHASIZE AG
RICULTUHE
SCHOOLS PLAN TO GIVE
ESPECIAL PROMINENCE TO
CHIEF INDUSTRY OF
COMMUNITY.
Will Endeavor to Aid in Determining
Vocational Proclivities—Co-opera
tion of Parents—Matters ot Inter
est in the Schools of City—Debate
Try-out Thursday Evening.
(By the School Correspondent.)
Being situated in the center of one
of the richest agricultural districts in
Idaho, Caldwell places her greatest
dependency upon the farming indus
try for future growth and expansion.
Agricultural education, then, in con
nection with learning in the branches
of manual and domestic arts are the
lines of attack that should naturally
be assumed by the public schools. The
desire of the newer education is to
prepare the young men or young wo
man to fit into the community in a
useful way so that he or she may at
once become a productive citizen com
petent to do the tasks of life without
an eternal personal feeling that some
thing else- might have been better.
Vocational Guidance Vital Question.
The crying need of every com
munity is a means of determining ac
curately what individuals are best fit
ted to do. Too many young men
have answered the call of the profes
sions such as engineering because on
the surface it seemed like a pleasant
life to lead. Little did he realize,
perhaps, that he must be an expert
mathematician, and that he must have
other qualities that he did not possess.
These facts are too often found out
when it is too late to alter conditions.
The individual fails—simply be
cause he chose a profession that look
ed good—without knowing the real re
quirements and demands that he
would be called upon to fill.
Parents Should Encourage Children.
Parents may be of great service to
the schools in encouraging their
children to read stories and articles
which deal intelligently with the dif
ferent vocations of life. To be a suc
cess in life is to be capable in one's
business. To choose the business for
which we are really fitted, is to have
an intimate acquaintance with many.
This is a vital problem, and every
child will eventually have to solve it
for himself or else close his eyes and
blindly leap into the vocational melt
ing pot to grasp what he can.
To Emphasize the Vocations.
The natural impulse of every indi
vidual is to answer the call to duty, by
responding to economic demands. Vo
cational impulses dominate all, but
that domination is not always of the
same sort. Consequently we must
cease attempting to mould all individ
uals into the same cast.
It is the plan of the Caldwell
school to place emphasis upon the vo
cational departments, and to allow
them to expand and grow as rapidly
as the community will permit. It is
not the plan to place less emphasis up
on the regular academic work, but on
the contrary to merge the work of
these departments in a way to secure
the greatest efficiency from both.
The department of agriculture
should be the largest in our schools.
Since Caldwell is so dependent upon
this vocation, and all of us are either
directly or indirectly involved in it,
education along this line is exceeding
ly practical.
Garden Clubs a Step.
The movement that is being under
taken to institute garden clubs in
Caldwell is a step in the right direc
tion. It leads boys and girls to real
living, and it interests them in the
things they need to know. It directs
them to be useful, and to be produc
ers. It teaches them to co-operate
and to be good citizens.
Van Buren Parent-Teachers' As'sn
Buys Victrola.
The members of the Parent-Teach
ers' association of the Van Buren
building got together on a scheme to
raise sufficient money to purchase a
school victrola for their ward. They
held a baked-goods sale and circulat
ed among the patrons of their com
munity and aroused some good sub
stantial interest. They secured what
they went after and their victrola ma
chine is on the way.
Nearly 100 Attended Afternoon Meet
The members of the Parent-Teach
ers' association of the Lincoln build
ing met a week ago and elected new
officers and perfected a complete re
organization. It was a thrilling meet
ing of the most co-operative sort. An
excellent program on the subject of
Thrift was provided. The officers
elected are: Mrs. H. R. Cleaver,
president; Mr. R. E. English, vice
president; Mrs. L. F. McNitt, secre
tary-treasurer.
From the spirit manifested at this
meeting, some very good things
should come from this association.
Debate Try-out Thursday Night,
The debate try-outs will be held in
the high school assembly on Thurs
day evening. The members of the
teams which will represent Caldwell
in the league debate this year will be
chosen at this time. The public Is
cordially invited to attend. The pro
gram commences at 8 o'clock.
Weiser to Play Here Friday Night.
The boys' basket ball team of the
Weiser High school will toss baskets
in competition with the Caldwell team
at the high school gymnasium next
Friday evening, February 11th. Cald

Be Raised At Once.
Will
The board of directors of the Suc
cor Creek Irrigation District met with
engineer, Guy C. McGee and about 25
or 30 landowners in the district in
this city Monday. The report of the
engineer was adopted. The board of
directors, composed of Messrs. Frank

At the meeting it was unanimously
decided not to water any land under
the A canal of the Gem Irrigation
District.
The land owners of this irrigation
district are well pleased with the pro
gress that has been made. The pro
ject will be financed without difficulty.
The normal flow of water is sufficient
for 12,000 acres of land. The project
includes 10,000 acres which insures am
ple water under any climatic condi

PIONEER WOMAN WAS
DELIGHTFULLY ENTERTAINED
Old
Friends Pay Tributes to Mrs.
Elijah Frost on Birthday.
Friday evening, January 28th, was
celebrated the 76th birthday of one
of the early pioneers of Idaho, that of
Mrs. Matilda Frost, at her home on
South Kimball. The felicitous affair
was arranged and the feast provided
by the daughters of Mrs. Frost, Mrs.
H. W. Dorman, Mrs. M. A. Roberts,
and Mrs. H. Frost, and was a com
plete surprise to the guest of honor.
The company arrived in a body each
person bringing some token of re
memberance. Soon a table of banquet
length was spread with all the good
things of the season appropriate to the
occasion, cooked and served in good
old Southern style, not the least o!
which was a beautiful birthdav cake.
Handsome place cards were used.
Some of the guests were pioneer
friends who had gathered around the
hospitable board of Mrs. Frost in
1883. Many letters and cards of con
gratulation from absent friends were
read while they lingered around the
table. Grandma Frost, as she is fam
iliarly called by all, was born in Mis
souri in 1840. She was married at the
age of sixteen and in 1862 with her
husband and one or two small child
ren. started on one of those memor
able journeys across the plains which
ment so much hardship and danger.
Mrs. Frost, herself drove a team of
oxen much of the way, her husband,
the late Elijah Frost, being occupied
with duties as captain and guide for
the whole party, a train of fifty
wagons. He was a veteran plainsman,
this being his fifth trip across. He
spent the winter of 1847 in Portland,
Oregon, which then consisted of one
log cabin. During the more than six
months while they slowly crept across
prairie mountain and desert, Mrs.
Frost was ever ready with a word of
cheer for her sisters in distress and
when danger threatened and was
always a comfort and help
times of sickness or
cident. Their destination was Cal
ifornia. In 1865 they came to Idaho,
settling in the Boise Valley, sixteen
miles below Boise. In 1883 they mov
ed from there to Caldwell and made a
new home on the estate where she
still lives. This home soon oecame a
gathering place for young and old
from far and near, and all received a
motherly welcome.
The day of the ox team and the emi
grant wagon is past. The day of the
pioneer is closing. Few remain to
tell of the sacrifices which opened the
■way for the comparative ease and
comfort of today and of the
prosperity of the future. May Grand
ma Frost long be spared to enjoy the
love and respect which her beautiful
Character has engendered in all who
know her best.
There were present: Mesdames
Beatty, Geo. Little^ Picard, M. A
Roberts, Hedden, F .d. Adam. Keller
Patton, Meek, Goldsmith, Cook
Bloomfield of Nampa, Calloway, Ro
berts, Dorman. H. Frost, and two
grandchildren.
Sheriff Has Busy Week.
Sheriff Froman and deputies had a
busy week. Tuesday evening they
handcuffed Samson at the Bungalow
and Wednesday they had an attach
•ment case. Samson was too much
for the sheriff's force but the attach
ment proceedings were properlv hand
led.
The Idaho Implement Co. attached
the property of Chas. Sharp for debt
A considerable portion of the property
was exempt. A sack of flour and
some second hand lumber was
tained by the sheriff.

Evening—Committee in City Wag
ing Whirlwind Campaign Time Up
February 15th.
The enthusiasm aroused over the
contemplated electrification of the
Wilder branch by the Caldwell Trac
tion Co. is steadily growing as the
time limit of February 15 draws near.
W. L. Hasbrouck was yesterday in
receipt of a letter from VV. H. Red
way in which he unqualifiedly endors
ed the plan, commended the security
offered by the bonds and—proved his
earnestness by subscribing $500.00.
Monday evening at the Odd Fellows
hall at Wilder, notwithstanding the
miserable state of the roads, a crowd
amended the meeting and several
more bonds were subscribed. C. F.
Smith, Chas. F. Oellien and H. F.
Hoadley, who live on the Caldwell
Traction Line, Deer Flat, spoke of
the excellent service and treatment ac
corded them by the Sebree road—and
the financial value of an electric line
passing through the country.
Messrs. Hasbrouck, E. H. Plowhead,
A. O. Christopher, and Jordan address
ed the meeting on various phases of
the proposition.
Col. Amos Miller added to the en
joyableness of the meeting with his
wit, and by adding to his subscription
for the bonds. Mr, C. R. Peckhain
also added two more bonds to his
allotment.
City Committee Now Busy.
The committee working in the city
is putting forth every effort to fill
their allotment of $12,500 before the

city—women not at all barred—will
be given an opportunity to invest in
one or more of the bonds.
Greenleaf Tomorrow Night.
A meeting is scheduled for tomor

FREE TRANSPORTATION FÖR
FAIR PROMOTERS ASKED
Hendershot and Glenn Think They
Need Railroad Passes.
The Caldwell Traction Co. is in
receipt of a request for free transpor
tation for a Mr. Glenn and Mr. O. P.
Hendershot. These ngentHemen are
connected with the Gem States Fair
association of Boise and their official
business is to promote that institu
tion.
Needless to say the request was
turned down. The Caldwell Traction
Co. could not see its obligation to
this private Boise enterprise.
D. W. COLE SUCCEEDS
F. E. WEYMOUTH ON PROJECT
New Man Took Charge Monday—
Weymouth is Chief of Construction.
C E. Weymouth has been succeeded
by D. W. Cole on the Boise recla
mation project. Mr. Cole arrived and
took charge of the local project Mon
day. Mr. Weymouth was recently ap
pointed chief of construction of the
service, with headquarters in Denver.
He will leave Boise soon for Califor
nia, where he will spend several weeks
recuperating from the illness which
has incapacitated him for several
weeks. C. C. Fisher, first assistant,
who has been acting project manager
during the illness of Mr. Weymouth,
will remain in Boise as assistant to
Mr. Cole, so far as the plans of the
department are known, and no other
changes are contemplated at the pres
ent time.
Veteran in Service.
Mr. Cole conies to Boise from Fal
lan. Nev., where he held a similar po
sition to his present one, as manager
of the Truckee-Carson project. He
has been in the reclamation service 12
years and was the builder of the Sho
shone dam in Wyoming, which was,
until the construction of the Arrow
rock dam, the highest in the world.
Both Mr. Weymouth and C. H. Paul
who was engineer in charge of con
struction during the building of the
Arrowrock dam, are old friends of the
new project manager, the three hav
ing worked together in Massachusetts
many years ago. Mr. Cole's only visit
to this city prior to his appointment
as project manager was a few years
ago, when he paid a visit to Mr. Paul
at Arrowrock.
Physicians Appeal to Supreme Court.
Drs. I. R. Woodward and J. C.
Woodward, defendants in a suit for
$50,000 damages, brought bv Dr. C.
A. Barton, have appealed to the su
preme court from the verdict of the
jury in the district court, whereby a
verdict amounting to $2,000 was
avvarded to Barton. The suit was in
stituted by Dr. Barton to obtain dam
ages on account of Drs. Woodward,
endeavoring to have Barton adjudged
insane, at another time charging him
with unlawful practice of medicine and
surgery without a license.
The case was tried in the district
court before Judge R. N. Dunn, last
December, and attracted much atten
tion from the medical profession in
the state. The parties all reside at
Payette.
