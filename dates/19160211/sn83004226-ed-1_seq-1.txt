ELKHORN COAL COMPANIES
ARE CONSOLIDATED
BIO SANDY'8 GREAT MINING COR
PORATIONS NOW UNDER
ONE HEAD.
Announcement here yesterday of the
dissolution of the well-known law firm
of Neat A Suickllng, following the sev
erance of their connection with sever
al big coal companies In eastern Ken
tucky, for which they naev been counsel
for several years, also brought to light
the cunsumation of a gigantic transac
tion In mining Interests and securities
which promise to play an Important
part In the future development of the
great eastern Kentucky fields. Neal A
Strlckling wea attorneys for the Min
eral Fuel company, the Klkhorn Fuel
company and the Klkhorn Mining cor
poration, all of which have transferred
their holdings to the Klkhorn Fuel cor
poration, the legal department of which
has been consolidated with that of the
Consolidation Coal company of Fair
mont. The Klkhorn Coal corporation
has at present no resident counsel In
Huntington.
There have beon rumors of this big
merger of eastern Kentucky companies
for some time but the announcement
In connection with the announcement
of the Neal A Hliickltng dissolution
was the first official word of its cun
sumation received In Huntington.
It Is reported here that the Rocke
feller Interests have beoome connected
with the Interests of the Consolidation
Coal company and that they made the
reorganization and recapitalization of
the eastern Kentucky companies pos
sible. The recapitalization was .effected
through the Issuance of 19,0(10,000 in
notes, which are supposed to have been
handled through the Rockefellers. This
money will be used to pay oft the out
standing Indebtedness against the prop
erties and to provide working capital
for the continued development of the
great field.
No definite announcement as to the
plans of the new corporation has been
received here, but all of the present
activities are taken to Indicate that op
eration Is to go on a larger and much
more extensive' scale and that the
probabilities are that there will be not
only new coal development as well. "
In this connection. It Is stated, not
through the officials or employes of the
railroad, but through sources which
have Information which bears every
earmark of reliability, that the Balti

the Baltimore A Ohio line , at Shelby
whloh leads to Jenkins, and then a
road to connect with the Norfolk A
Western at Louisa, or some other ex
tension to provide the Baltimore A
Ohio an outlet from the eastern Ken
tucky field.
The Milwaukee Coal company has
been operating In Kentucky for two
years at mines which are not adjacent
to any railroad and at which a great
coal tonnage has been stacked await
ing shipment. This Is said to be coal
of such a grads as to compare favor
ably with the best soft ooal In the
world, producing a minimum amount
of ashes.

ANOTHER LETTER
v OF REMINISCENSES
tON HUTCHI80N WRITES INTER.
; ESTINQLY OF OLD TIMES
IN LOUISA.
A few days ago Dr. Wroten received
a well-written letter from ' Mr. Lon
Hutchison, of Huntington so full of in
terestlng remtnjscence that the re
cipient of the epistle considers It wor
thy of a place In. the NEWS. Lon was
an old Masonic Academy boy, a bright.
Intelligent lad. The surviving "boys
and girls" who were his schoolmates
will read his letter with great pleasure.
Dr. O, W. Wroten, ."-
Louisa, Ky.
My Dear Old Teacher:
In glancing through a copy of one of
the dallies that I happened to run
across, in the Items from Louisa, I
read that "Dr. O. W. Wroten, who bas
been 111 for some time Is Improving.'
This Item called up a flood of mem
ories, and I decided to write you a let
ter. Let me say In the beginning, I
trust you have fully recovered, and
that you have many years of life yet
before you, although you must be well
up In vi.ire now, as I recently parsed
the 58th mile post myself. .
I I was called to Louisa hurriedly a
I year nr so ago, but found time before
I the train left to run up to the old -ia-sonlc
Academy to see If I could find
my father s "mark," my Ides being to
adopt that aa mine when I take the
Chapter. I hnve filled the chairs in the
Blue Uidtte, and am a 1'ast Muster.

girl's side,
I wonder if any of the boys ever
think over the old times. A history of
your scholars would no doubt make In
teresting and varied reading. I recall
studious times, all right, au well as the
wonderful stories Miss Mary Mont
gomery used to read us; the spirited
games of Prisoner's Base, Town Ball,
"Cat" ajid later Base Ball. Then there
were the excursions to Mill creel for
cedar for decorative purposes, the an
nual fishing trips to "Two Mile" and
the wonderful strings of three Inch and
less "sun pearchea" we would bring
home; the skating on Lick creek and
the Sunday afternoon trips to the hills
for "mountain tea."
Then the songs we used to sing
"Come where the Heather Bloometh,"
"The Moon is beaming o'er the Lake,"
"The Murseilaise" and "Johnny Smok
er," Then there was the "Exhibition"
at the end of the school year. My first
appearance, I believe, was as Col. Tom
Thumb, with Mary Belle Bowe, as La
vlnla Warren 1 Do you remember the
time when Bern. Marcum was thrilling
the audience with "Lochiel's Warning"
and forgot his lines and had to go off
the stage? I can see now the "8AP
IENTIA OMNIBUS PRAESTAT" done
In evergreen by the gifted Henry Stew
art, which graced the walls for months
after the exhibition. Do you remem
ber the ever-so-often blowing the soot
out of the stove pipe with powder,
which called for the services of two
of the larger boys to hold the top lid
down? And the wonderful experiments
In Chemistry you used to perform be
fore the class (with every scholar In
school paying attention) Happy, hap
py days. Every foot of the old town
from Green McHenry's wharf to the
Fort Hill, and from Grandma Jones' to
Wallace's Is dear to me. Pawpaws
were never so plentiful and luscious
as those that grew on Virginia Point,
and who ever saw such "punklns" as
grew in the field below John Plgg'a big
barn 7 The old loafing places, Ram
Berry Justice's shoe shop. Bill Troy's
paint shop, 'Nard Holt's brick yard.and
Bob Clear's Cabinet shop stand out. I
remember Bob's old fiddle and his sug
gestive rendering of the "Unfortunate
Dog." Then there were the games of
hand bait, as played by George John-1
son, Marlon Stone and others, at the
rear of the Jail. I
I can remember Dick Vinson's "belch
lng," Tip Moore's pigeon-toed walk,
and Doc. Shannon's "suttln and sure."
I also recall the time the "Eclampus
Vitus" were holding occasional ses
sions, and the admission made by old
Grandpnp Holt. I can name moat of
the men of the town, beginning with
the Hon. J. M. Rice, the leading citi
zen, Keene Prlchard, John Jones, Bill
Waldeck, Leo Frank, Judge Fergnson,
Levi Atkins, Georgo Murray, John
Ross, Dr. Yates, Dr. Swetnam, Roll

Clayton, Pitt Davenport, Jim O'Brien,
Billy Bowe, George Chapman, Milt

and dc-wn to Stud Parker,' Esq. Jake
Rice's bas singing stands out In my
recollection as being the finest 1 ever
heard, and 1 have had the privilege of
hearing some singers of a national rep
utntlon. This reminds me that I have
a Victor machine, and dan hear all the
great artists of the world, as well aa
any of the Bands or Orchestras, and
quits often when listening to Melba or
Tetraiinnl I have thought of you and
wished you could hear also, though no
doubt you have a machine of your own.
. We have two sons, both married ; one
here with us, an architect, the other a
bookkeeper in one of the Banks In
Albuquerque, New Mexico. I am in
business for, myself, doing very well,
own our own home, are well, content
ed and thankful.
I think J should like to hear from
you some time when you have the In
clination to write, aa I still think a
very great deal of John Godfrey.
Yours sincerely,
LON H. HUTCHISON.
I Just happened to remember Lewis
Dempsey's rendering of "We meet up
on the Level, and we part upon the
Square.". - He wore your apron and

FEAR FOR SANITY OF
KANAWHA PILOT.
Maysvllle, Ky., Jan. 27. It has been
reported that Pilot Brady Berry, who
had charge of the wheel on the ill
fated steamer Kanawha on the night
of the wreck, has been arrested by the
West Virginia authorities, but steam
boat men passing here say this Is un
true. They say that the Federal In
spector at PC Pleasant ordered Berry
to leave the steamer Dunbar at Pitta
burg and deliver to him his license,
which was surrendered, until the In
vestigation is completed and a decis
ion reached. It Is stated that friends of
pilot Berry are. fearful that he will be

. THE RECITAL,
The piano and vocal recital In the
courthouse by Prof. Umileet, assisted
by Miss Jeanne Adams, accompanist.
waa a success, and a treat to the mu
sical people of Louisa. The audience
was larger than usual for such enter
tainments here. Altho completely ex
hausted when be began. Prof. Umtleet
soon forgot his ailments and pleaaed
the audience so with the first group of
four piano selections that he had to
come back with an encore.
The second group consisted of four
well chosen songs. On the completion
of these the audience was enthusiastic
in their applause for more, and .the
Professor came back and sang the hu
morous song "O No John." This set
the audience all re, and then he sang
the "Village Maid" but that' did not
satisfy them, and he was recalled six
times before they let him rest.
The third group consisted of piano
classics, with one of Mr. Umtleet's own
compositions, completing the group and
making a favorable Impression as a
composer.
The fourth group were songs of more
serious nature but none the less inter
esting. We look forward to future re
citals to be given by this able young
man. . OBSERVER.
