SH-H-H! MORE GAS RUMBLINGS
COUNCIL ASKED TO EXTEND THE
FRANCHISE OF GAS COM
PANY ONCE MORE
Hello! What's this? A letter from
the Columbus Gas Construction com
pany? Oh yes, about two years ago a
company by that name was granted a
franchise to install a gas plant in Lit
tle Falls, which plant was to be. in
operation within a few months. But
what can they want now? Only an ex
tension of (the limit of the time re
quired to begin work on the installa
tion of the plant.
Letters containing this request have
been sent to the city mayor and the
city council and the local stockholders
of fbhe Little Falls-Darling Gas com
pany have also been notified of the re
quest. The matter probably will be
brought up at the next meeting of the
council. As the matter now stands,
the sum of $500 is due the city from
the bonding company, as a resuli of
ithe failure of the gas company to ful
fill the requirements of the franchise.
(No steps were ever taken to collect
the money, however.
The gas company also sent a state
ment showing the business done by it
during the last fiscal year, ending Jan
uary 31, 1916. This statement was no
doubt imtended to show that the com
pany is still doing business, in other
places.

instituted such schools or classes.
A few days ago Mr. Griffing, of the
Naturalization department, called on
the members of the board oi educa

the organization of a n.ight school for
the foreign born residents of this com
munity, especially those who had tak
en out their first papers and were anx
ious to prepare themselves to pass the
final examination, required for citizett
ship. This school would also include
any others who wish to improve them
selves in English or civil government,
by taking advantage of such a course.
This matter was brought up at the last
board meeting for consideration. The
members of the board feel that it
would be. a move in the right direction,
provided there was sufficient demand
on the part of those who desired such
a course, and -they would like to have
those interested, notify the sunerin
tehdent in regard to their, desires, in
order that he may report at the next)
board meeting. They would also

the citizens of the community on th«
feasibility of' organizing a night schop^
for foreign-born' men and women. The^i

the columns of the local papers, on the
feasibility of organizing a night school
for young men and women 16 years |»f
age or more, which would offer a more
extended course, including English,
spelling, penmanship, business corres
pondence, business arithmetic, elemen
tary bookkeeping, and any other sub
ject for which there was sufficient cfe
mand.
There are, without doubt, a large
number of young men and women In
Little Falls, who would do we±- to ta$te
advantage of such a course, and they
are earnestly reauested to file their ap
plication with Mr. Dobbyn, at once,, in
order that the board may know the ex

COUNTY TO BUY CLOCK SOON
ANDITOR MAKING INQUIRIES AS
TO DIFFERENT KINDS—WILL
COST 92,000
Morrison county will 'ere long be
the proud possessor of a clock which
will be located in the tower of the
court house building, where its face
will announce the time of the day and
the chimes will peal forth to announce
each passing hour to those who cannot
see it, always reminding them of the
late Josiah Page, through whose gen
erosity its purchase has "been made pos
sible.
Various kinds of clocks are manu
factured and County Auditor McNairy
has been instructed to write to the dif
ferent placeis where such clocks are in
use to inquire as to their cost, etc. At
the Catholic cathedral at Freeport a
clock was recently installed at a cost"
of $1,440, according to a letter from
the priest' at that place. This clock,
the writer states, is one of the latest
improved kinds, equipped with beauti
ful chimes and with semi-automatic
winding contrivance. It has proven
very satisfactory and the people are
well pleased with it.
Morrison county has $2,000 to spend
for a clock for the court house as the
result of the will of Mr. Page, and it
is likely that one costing that much
will be purchased as the bequest is a
specific one and the money could prob
ably not be used for any other pur
pose.

A regular monthly meeting was held
by /the city council Monday evening,
all members being present except
Johnson and Hall. Vice President
Moeglein acted as chairman in the ab
sence of Presid'ent Hall.
City Clerk Victor Schallem was in
structed to draw warrants each month
for the salary of Mrs. Amanda. Stedler,
who takes care "of the firemen's room
at the city hall. She is paid $15 per
month for her services.
The poor committee was instructed
to try and make the best arrangements
possible for the care of a feeble mind
ed girl at the hospital, until she can
be sent to the school for feeble minded
at Faribault. The girl was until re
cently under the care of Jacob Posch
of the West side.
Alderman Bell asked the council
what steps to take in regard to the
care of Mrs. Chas. Beauchaine, who is
ill. The aldermen were of the opinion
that the Civic league, having assumed
the care of the woman from the begin
ning of her illness, should continue to
care for her.
A resolution was passed authorizing
the Pine Tree Manufacturing company
to make the necessary repairs on the
north wagon -bridge. The company is
to pay one-third of the cost, the city
one-third and the county one-third, not
to exceed $500. The county has al
ready appropriated its share. It is be
lieved that by-having the work done
by the direct employment of labor and
the purchase of material that several
hundred dollars can be saved. Street
Commissioner LaFond will inspect the

is located at the corner of Third street
and Second avenue southwest.
As a result of the allowing of a
large bill for the care of city prisoners
at the county jail, Alderman Venners
called attention to the fact that a cer
tain ordinance of which he was the
father provided that city prisoners
should work on the streets, under the
supervision of the city street commis-'
sioner. He said that the provisions. of
some money saved the .city,
City Clerk Schallern was instructed
to publish a notice inviting all the
physicians of the city to come to the
city hall and get acquainted with the
working of the city lungmotor. This
was upon the suggestion of Alderman
Murphy. The salesman representing
the concern which has the sale of his
machine comes here quite often and
arrangements may be made to have all
physicians and city officials be present
at a demonstration of the use of the
machine.
Aldermen Venners and LaFond were
appointed as a committee to look up
the matter of getting liability insur
ance for the city employes. This is
being done in many of the larger cities

the injury or death from injury of a
city employe. The committee was giv
en power to act.
The chairman of the street commit
tee was authorized to purchase rub
ber boots for the city street commis
sioner.

(CONGRESSMAN C. A. LINDBERGH
TELLS ECONOMY COMMISSION
FLANS FOR REFORM
St. Paul Pioneer Press (9): "For the.
kind of service we are getting from
public officials, we should! pay no
itaxes," said Representative Charles A.
Lindbergh of the Sixth district bef re
the Efficiency and Economy commis
sion yesterday afternoon.
Denounces Government Waste
The congressman, who came from
Washington to appear before the com
mission, scathingly denounced the ex
travagances and waste of the'present
system of government, both. Federal
and state, and in his two-hour speech,
took occasion to discuss the Federal
reserve system, Panama canal tolls,
and ito advocate government owner
ship of railroads.
Legislature Too Large
"The legislature is altogether too
large and congress is also too large to
accomplish the best results,'' he said.
"A body of men no larger than this
committee would be preferable to as
large a body as the present Minnesota
legislature.''
Calls Roads National Evil
He ciited as examples of efficiency
the railroads and1 other corporations,
and later pointed out the railroads as
one of the evils of the nation, but he
digressed to declare, however, that he
believed St. Paul needs a ifew depot,
in which opinion the entire assemblage
concurred.
Favors Many Primaries
Through a different system of pri
maries, he declared the people would
be better informed as to policies and'
candidates. He suggested that instead
of holding one primary, a half dozen
should be held to inform voters of the
issues.
Attacks Federal Banks
The Federal reserve bank law was
criticized as establishing a' money
trust, and thus thwarting ithe purpose

CITY HIGH QUINT TOMOR
ROW NIGHT
St. Cloud high school's basketball
team is the next on the program for
the local high and they journey down
there tomorrow for a game. A number
of rooters expect to accompany the
team.
From all indications the contest will
be a good one, as both teams are about
equal and both are anxious to win. St.
Cloud has won the greater percentage
of games played this season. They
defeated Royalton by an overwhelm
ing score early in the season and the
local boys did likewise last Friday,
the score in Friday's gome being even
more one-sided than in the game be
tween St. Cloud and Royalton.
The schedule of the local team is as'
yet not half completed, eight gamed
yet remaining to be played. The sched*
ule closes March 18.
MUSICAL ART CLUB
At the meeting of the literary sec
tion of ithe club Tuesday evening at
the library parlors L. A. Snelling, wire
chief for the Northwestern Telephone
company here gave a paper on "The
Government Ownership of Tele
phones." He took the stand that
privately owned and controlled! tele
phone service is better than that to
be had by government ownership. One
reason for this, he said, is because the
telephone system, if it was owned by
the government, would be maintained
by appropriations.. If the funds appro
priated should prove inadequate, the
system would have to stop doing busi
ness until another appropriation could
be made, he said. Government owner
ship would also throw increased bur
dens onto the shoulders of the govern
ment, which is already overburdened,
and it would tend to increase the cor
ruption of politics. Mr. Snelling stat
ed that he believed it would bis better
for the people to have the regulation
of the. telephone system in their own
hands than to own them.
