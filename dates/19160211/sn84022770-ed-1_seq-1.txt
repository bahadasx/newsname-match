FEBRIMBY 2126 IS
PIMP WEEK HERE
PRACTIC ALLY EVERY LOCAL
MERCHANT JOINS IN NATION
WIDE CAMPAIGN.
National pay-up week for Olympia
and Thurston county, which is also
to be observed in all parts of the
United States from the 21st to the
26th of February, promises to prove
successful, as a great majority of the
business houses are enrolled in the
general campaign against obliga
tions.
Owing to the storms of the past
week, which have delayed all express,
the Olympla Chamber of Commerce
has not as yet received the campaign
literature ordered, but should this
(ail to arrive in time, the committee
in charge is determined to make the
campaign a success and is prepared
to start independent of the national
movement, should the material nec
esary fail to arrive by the first of the
week.
The Idea Behind It.
Pay-up campaigns have been high
ly successful in a great many cities
throughout the country and the
scheme is no longer a venture but
pronounced highly successful. The
object is to set aside the last week
in February as the general time for
liquidation. If each individual pays
his accounts, this act releases money
in all channels of trade with the re
sult that each is able to meet his bills
because the other fellow has or is
going to pay him.
National pay-up week had its be
ginning in the little city of Waukon,
lowa, a county seat of but little over
2,000 population at the end of a
little railway in the northeastern part
of the state of lowa. Waukon Is a
beautiful little city, and busy busi
ness center, but the people of that
community are like the people in
many another town and community
—that is, some of them during the
past years bought goods for which
they never paid, until the week of
January 9-15, 1915, the principal of
the high school, who happened to be
secretary of the Commercial club,
suggested that It would be a good
thing for Waukon to have a day of
reckoning, or rather, a week of reck-
onlng.
The Idea appealed to the business
men of Waukon, more particularly
to the merchants who had consider
able money In outstanding accounts.
So the week of January 9-15 was ad
vertised as pay-up week, and during
that time in this little city, more than
$50,000 in old acounts was wiped off
the books of the local business
houses.
Everybody seemed to join In the
spirit, and consequently all found it
easy to pay their debts. And it is
needless to say that prosperity
reigned in that town, for it means
something to a town of 2,000 popu
lation to lift a debt of $50,000 in one
week's time, and especially when
part of the debt is so old that it has
been considered uncollectible.
Credit Sometimes Abused.
Credit Is one of the great assets j
of the present-day system of busi- j
ness, but like many another good i
thing It Is sometimes abused and
overdone, and because so many
people are careless about paying
their accounts, there are millions j
upon millions of dollars in outstand-J
ing accounts in this country today J
that could be paid without Inconven
iencing the debtor, and If all these
millions of dollars were put Into cir
culation during one week, there
would be the greatest week of pros
perity the country had ever known.
Credit is national In its scope. The
manufacturer extends credit to the
Jobber, the jobber carries the retail
merchant, the merchant in turn ex
tends credit to his customers, and,
therefore, every business interest Is
Interested in National Pay-Up Week.
If local people make it a point to pay
the doctor, the preacher, the grocer
and nil other merchants, and the
merchant makes it a point to pay the
wholesaler and the Jobber, and the
wholesaler to pay the manufacturer
during this week, February 21-26.
more dollars will be put In circula
tion in this country than were ever
started moving during the same
length of time.

ARGUMENTS OF OTHER CON
TRIBUTORS.
Tumwater, Wash.,
February 7th, 1916.
Editor Standard.
Dear Sir:
I have been reading the various
articles which have been published in
your paper of late in relation to the
farm expert, Potato club, and kin
dred subjects, illustrating the differ
ent view-points of people whose in
terests lay along the same paths. To
commence with, I have no wish to
enter into a newspaper controversy,
or to gain any notoriety, as, being
somewhat of a stranger in this coun
ty, I may not be as well informed as
some as to all the causes leading up
to this discussion. Be that as it may,
having lived in several different
counties of this state and having
been engaged in farming for the last
18 years here in Washington, I am
vitally interested in anything per
taining to farming or farming life.
As to the farm expert, it is
charged that the county paid him
SI,BOO per year. As I understand it
the state paid about SI,OOO of that,
so, after all, all the county paid was
about SBOO or S9OO a year; the bal
ance, what the state paid, we have to
pay anyway whether we have the ex
pert or not; it comes out of the state
ta"*es. The question is, could we not
have found a better way to save S9OO
per year than to have given our
county such an advertisement? To
advertise to the rest of the state and
to the world in general that Thurs
ton county desires no advancement,
is to be classed among those who de
sire to be called .reactionary, old
timers and all the rest of the things
that this implies and will give us a
reputation out in the world that will
take us many years to overcome, and
all to save S9OO a year that the
county commissioners may squander
any day on some foolish thing and
none of those who have done so
much shouting will say a word.
Cites One Experience.
This season I raised and sold over,
400 broilers, taking them to market
in lots of about 75, when I could get
them in fit condition. My farm is
seven miles from Olympia. The first
time I went with a coop of chickens
I had not gone far before a man
stopped me. He was a stranger. He
told me I had better take my chick-.
ens home again, as he had just taken
some In and had been unable to get
anything for them, that one could
not sell anything in Olympia, and so |
on—the usual song of the knocker, i
Not being very well acquainted, I at
first thought I had best take them
home, as he told me to do, but on re-1
flection I determined to go on and,
see for myself. Before I reached i
Olympia three other parties whom 11
met had stopped me and told me the
same story about the bad place Olym
pia was to sell anything. I went on
however and sold the chickens to the
first man I asked to buy them for 16
cents a pound, which I considered a
very good price indeed. And every

OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1916.
INDIANS NEED LICENSES
Must Obey Hunting and Fishing
Laws, Supreme Court Rules.
The words "in common with the
citizens of the territory" in the fa
mous Indian treaty negotiated by
Washington's first territorial gover
nor, Isaac Ingalls Stevens, placed the
Indians upon the same plane as the
whites as to hunting and fishing,
while the enabling act which made
the territory a state abrogated the
treaty and gave the state full regu
lation through Its police powers, the
state supreme court has ruled in a
test case brought by State Pish Com
missioner L. H. Darwin, over-ruling
the Benton county superior court.
This means that Washington In
dians must have hunting and fishing
licenses and must obey the state
game laws, having no privileges not
accorded the white man. The issue
decided by the supreme court has
been in question for years, the In
dians claiming that the intent of the
Indian treaty of 1859 was that they
had the right to fish and hunt in
their "usual and accustomed haunts"
without restriction. The majority
decision was written by Judge Fred
erick Bausman, who holds that the
Indian has equal rights with the
white man. but no more. Judge
Holcomb dissented, maintaining that
the enabling act did not abrogate the
treaty.

E. G. Beley, superintendent of the
bottlehouse of the Olympia Brewing
company for the last 10 years, has
resigned that position and expects to
leave next Tuesday for Norristown,
Pa., to accept the management of a
new bottlehouse just erected by a
large brewery there. Henry Henius,
formerly brewmaster at the local
brewery, holds a similar position at
the Norristown brewery. Mr. Beley
will visit his parents at Livingston,
Mont., for a short time before pro
ceeding to Norristown, but Mrs. Beley
and young son will spend several
months there. The Beleys have many
friends in Olympia who extend them
best wishes for success in their new
home.
Originally set for hearing last Fri
day, the mandamus suit involving
the state capitol bond issue will be
argued before the state supreme
court Friday of this week.
JOHNSON SENDS BIG SUPPLY OF SEEDS
Seeds—all kinds of 'em —vegetable and flower and flower and
vegetable—beet, cucumber, lettuce, onion and radish—peas, beet,
lettuce, radish and muskmelon—candytuft, coreopsis, delphinium,
morning glory and poppy—dianthus, zinnia, candytuft, poppy and
morning glory—are scattered over one of the large tables in The
Washington Standard office, sent here by Congressman Albert John
son for free distribution to the gardeners of Thurston county.
They're yours for the asking—come in and get 'em.
The supply is not unlimited, but there's a lot of 'ein—four big
mail sacks full—and there'll doubtless be enough to go around.
They're good seeds, too —government seeds. Better have some.
PUTS BAN ON DICE GAMES
Prosecuting Attorney Yantis Notifies
Cigar Stores and Poolrooms to
Stop Gambling.
Notice that all dice games, punch
boards and similar devices must be
stopped Immediately was served upon
local cigar stores and poolrooms
Tuesday by Prosecuting Attorney
Geo. F. Yantis, as the result of nu
merous complaints made to him.
Several of the larger stores welcomed
the notice, stating that dice-shaking
was a nuisance they were glad to get
rid of, but some of the smaller es
tablishments raised a "holler."
Such forms of gambling are ta
booed by law and now that the offi
cial ban has been put on them it is
likely that other forms of gambling
reported to be prevalent in the city
will also be stopped.
Spud Club Meets Saturday.
Thurston county farmers who have
seed potatoes for sale are again par
ticularly urged to attend the meet
ing of the Potato club at the Cham

every farmer who expects to plant
potatoes this year, so that it can be
informed as to the acreage in spuds
and make the necessary marketing
arrangements.

"CHINOOK" MELTS DEEP SNOW.
Western Washington Experiences
Warm Weather and Rains.
Except for snow flurries Tuesday
afternoon, which simply added to the
slush on the sidewalks and streets,
Olympia and Western Washington
have been experiencing the predicted
"chinook" this week, much of the
snow is gone and, though there is
considerable remaining, the steady
rains each day are making big in
roads in it.
Though streets are slushy, roads
muddy and the situation generally is
unpleasant, fears of heavy floods
which would cause slides to block
railroad traffic, have not material
ized. Slides, however, have occurred
in various re-grade districts in Seat
tle, two people being killed in one in
stance, and quite a number of homes
being demolished.
MEN'S GLUB FAVORS
SANE PREPAREDNESS
CITIZEN SOLDIERY PLANS AP
PROVED AT MEETING OF
OLYMPIANS TUESDAY.
Preparedness for defense, not ag
gression; preparedness which will in
sure the maintenance of the nation's
honor and of the principles it cham
pions among the nations; prepared
ness of a reasonable nature, carried
out in a safe, sensible, "porkless"
manner; preparedness which will
produce a citizen soldiery, as Presi
dent Wilson proposes, not a large
standing army, and will afford a
physical and mental training as val
uable for the business world as for
military purposes preparedness
which doeß no more than prepare and
does not convert the United States
into a military camp, was indorsed
by practically every one of the 50
persons who attended the February
meeting of the Men's club of St.
John's Episcopal church Tuesday
evening.
Rt. Rev. Frederick W. Keator of
Tacoma, bishop of the diocese of
Olympia, was to have spoken at the
meeting, but was unable to attend on
account of illness. Governor Ernest
Lister was the principal speaker,
striking the keynote of the evening
when, after pointing out the need of
coast defenses on Puget Sound and
the Willapa and Gray's harbors and
declaring the greatest difficulty of the
present situation to be the lack of
efficient, trained men, he asserted thai
the nation should not go crazy over
preparedness, expressed the opinion
that the country would not be doomed
if the present congress did not act
upon the subject, and stated that
there were other features of govern
mental endeavor which should not bo
lost sight of.
Pastor and Judges Approve.
The first talk of the evening wa9
made by Rev. D. A. Thompson, pas
tor of the First Presbyterian church,
who indorsed preparedness as neces
sary not only for the defense of the
country but to maintain the prin
ciples the United States champions
before the world. Judges E. N. Par
ker and O. G. Ellis of the state su
preme court expressed themselves as
favoring and believing necessary a
reasonable preparedness, to the ex
tent that the nation would be ready
in case it ever had to go to war.
"I didn't raise my boy to be a sol
dier," said one of the speakers, quot
ing a popular song, "but if he's called
to fight, I want him to know how to
take care of himself," a thought that
was frequently emphasized during the
evening.
It was for this reason that practi
cally every speaker of the evening,
except Principal N. J. Aiken of the
high school, favored the plan of a
citizen soldiery and thought it most
essential, it being proposed that such
military training be given in the high
schools as well as the colleges.
Join in General Discussion.
The subject was generally discussed
by those present for more than two
hours, talks being made by W. T.
Cavanaugh, F. 6. Blakeslee, C. H.
Springer, Assistant Attorney General
Howard Waterman, Captain Lord,
State Librarian J. M. Hitt, Jesse T.

SECOND m OF
GILLIES GOHe ON
DEPOSED CLAIM AGENT, CON
VICTED OF FORGERY, FACING
GRAND LARCENY CHARGE.
After two days and a half spent la
obtaining a Jury—a longer time than
at the first trial—the taking of tes
timony in the second trial of J. P.
Gillies, deposed claim agent of the
Industrial insurance department, this
time on a charge of grand larceny In
connection with the alleged bogus
claim of one "Don L. Jones" amount*
ing to 11,064.60, began late Wednes
day afternoon with the placing on
the witness stand of Percy Gilbert,
secretary of the commission, as the
state's first witness. Superior Judge
D. P. Wright is hearing the case.
Gilbert's examination and cross
examination were completed shortly
before noon Thursday and was de
voted entirely to explanation of offlce
details. Chairman Floyd L. Daggett
of the commission followed him as a
witness, testifying as to departmental
routine and also as to particular
claims. The state's case, which ia
being conducted by Assistant Attor
ney General John M. Wilson and
Prosecuting Attorney Geo. P. Yantis,
probably will not be completed before
the middle of next week.
In delivering his opening state
ment to the jury Wednesday after
noon, Wilson made the first publio
allegation that the three saloon
keepers who cashed the fraudulent
industrial insurance warrants re
ceived a share of the loot, when he
said that the state will prove the
saloonkeepers received half of the 10
per cent rake-ofT Frank Stone testi
fied In the previous trial he was to
get on each warrant he cashed, that
they received, in other words, 5 per
cent of the face of the warrants.
Members of Jury.
The defense did not make an open
ing statement to the jury, reserving
it until later. The jury which is
hearing the case is composed of six
men and six women: Mrs. C. A.
Wiley, Mrs. R. A. Cook, Mrs. John
Carlson, H. A. Roberts, J. H. Saun
ders, A. P. Manke, E. C. Meyers, Mrs.
William Teets, Charles Sorenson, Mrs,
O. B. Fall, F. A. Lange and Mrs.
William Martin.
Gillies was convicted of the first
charge placed against him, first de
gree forgery, by a verdict given last
Friday, the decision being reached on
the third ballot and after the jurors
had reviewed the evidence and in
spected the numerous exhibits in the
case. The case went to the jury
about 8 o'clock Thursday night and
when the jury retired about 11
o'clock that night without agreeing,
various bets were made that a dis
agreement would be reported. The
first ballot .taken Friday morning,
however, after the evidence had been
gone over, was unanimous for con
viction.
Gillies did not seem particularly
perturbed when the verdict was an
nounced and, through his counsel.
Attorney Thos. M. Vance, immediate
ly filed a motion for new trial. If
this is denied, Gillies says he will ap
peal to the Btate supreme court.
In support of the motion for new
trial, Attorney Vance presented an
affidavit to the court Wednesday,
made by one Mary Evans, alleging
that Mrs. M. H. Ranney, one of the
Jurors in the first trial, was disqual
ified because she remarked prior to
the trial that "Jack Gillies was
guilty." Later that afternoon the
state presented, an affidavit from Mrs.
Ranney herself, in which she denied
having made such a statement and
stated that at the time she was sup
posed to have made it she was serv
j ing as a juror in another case.
Three More Trials.
After the present trial, in which
an attempt is being made to convict
Gillies of obtaining money on the
fraudulent warrants issued on the
bogus claims he was convicted of
passing through his department, he
will be tried on another grand lar
ceny charge. Then Gene Kearna, for
mer proprietor of a local saloon, 1B
to be tried for grand larceny, sono
of the bogus warrants having bet i
cashed in his saloon, while Art
Young, a Tacoma saloonkeeper who
cashed some of the warrants, is to be
