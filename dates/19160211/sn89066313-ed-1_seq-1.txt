NUMBER 139
W.C.MARTINBEFORE
THE STUDENT SENATE
Research Editor Called to
Answer Charges Made by
Three Fraternities.
WITHHOLDS DEFENSE
Declines to Present Evidence
Reserving it For Dis
cipline Committee.
The Student Senate met last night
in the junior law room to investigate
charges of untruthfulness brought
against V. C. Martin by the Delta
Tail Delta, l'hi Delta Theta and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternities and by the
Student Senate itself. The charges
were based on statements made in the
Research, of which Martin is editor.
The charge of the Delta Tal Delta
fraternity was first read by the presi
dent of the senate, W. K. Atwood. This
fraternity charged that Martin's state
ment concerning it was untrue and
demanded that ho either apologize in
the University Missourian or have his
case acted upon by the Committee on
Discipline.
Asked if e had anything to say In
his defense, Martin stated that he had
evidence to answer the charges made,
but that he would not present this
evidence before the Studnt Senate. He
claimed that the Student Senate was
not an unbiased body because mem
bers of some of the fraternities mak
ing the charges were also members of
the senate, and the senate was acting
as Jury In the case it was prosecuting.
He further stated that he preferred
to bring his evidence directly before
the Discipline Committee, since It
had final authority.
Atwood told Martin his statement
was out of order, and if that was all
he had to say he was dismissed. Mar
tin then left the room.
Upon a motion by J. P. Hannlgan
the senate went into secret session to
hear the evidence of the several groups
of fraternity men. Atwood said that
the senate's final report to the Com
mittee on Discipline would be based
upon last night's investigation.

3IAKES SEW SHOE STYLES HERE
Local Factory Hoard Jlects This Week
to Plan Summer Footwear.
This week the Hamilton-Brown shoe
factory is helping to decide the style
of your summer footwear. The fac
tory Is making samples both of work
shoes and of the shoes which are
destined to become a part of the
stylish man's wardrobe.
Shoe styles are decided by a board,
consisting of the directors of the
company, some of the best salesmen
and the managers of different branches
of the company. They meet once a
week and discuss nevr ideas for shoes
and shoe styles, as well as other
business. From time to time during
the year samples of new styles and
new brands of shoes are called for.
These are looked over and discussed
by the board, and if it decides to put
them on the'mark'et niore samples are
ordered.
Among the samples which are being
made this week are several new shoes
which are going on the market for
the first time.
The local factory turns out all of
the samples for this branch of the
business. This week it will make 1,765
cases, each case having twenty-four
pairs of shoes in it. About $100,000
is represented in the yearly output of
samples, which will be distributed to
1C0 salesmen at the St. Louis office.
Each salesman receives his share and
is gone until he needs new ones.
These are ordered during the year
and are sent to St. Louis from the
