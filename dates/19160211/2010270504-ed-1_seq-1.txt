Tovvnsciid Jfcady to Plead Guilty
Frank Townsond, the young man
who was nrrosted at Candy Monday
for stealing a horse of Harry Stevens,
of Maxwell, and is in jail In this city
is ready "to break into the pen" or In
other words to plead guilty to horse
stealing. There Is some question as
to Townsend's age. At one time he de
clared ho was nineteen, at another
time sixteen. If only sixteen ho could
not be sentenced to the penitentiary
but could be sent to the reform scliool.
Townsend's father and mother are
dead and Sheriff Salisbury has writ
ten to the family at Trenton, Neb.,
with whom the young man made his
home in hope that he may obtain his
true age.

The Cost of Automobiles.
To tho Editor: I notice by a Lin
coln paper that Lincoln county has
743 automobiles. Have you stopped
to consider the expenses of maintain
ing and operating 743 cars, the depre
ciation and tho interest on the Invest
ment? If money is not plentiful In
Lincoln county it is partially due to
tho enormous automobile expenditure.
Here are some figures: If these
cars cost an average of $700 each tho
total Is, $520,100; if the life of a car is
five years the depreciation each year
on these cars Is $104,025. On tho sup
position that eac'li car averages 3,000
mllefl during the year, tho total mile
age Is 2,222,900, and if they average
fifteen miles on a gallon of gas the
consumption nt a cost of fouif.een
cents n. gallon (last year's average
price) or a total of $20,804; If a car
runs 400 miles on a gallon of lubri
cnting oil 5,572 galons of that oil was
consumed at a cost of $2,78G. Count
ing tire cost at one cent a mile, which
is low, the total is $22,290; the yearly
license on tho cars Is $2,200, then in
addition each car will average a re
pair bill or other garage charge of $10,
or 7;4"Q the taxes amount to not less
tthan $5,000, the Insurance $7,500, and
tlio interest on. the original invest
ment of $520,000 is $30-000 per year.
Add all these figures together and
you have a total of $200,000 expenses
for a year. SAM FLOCK.

"The road has been built through an Indian country
with all the tribes banded together and hostile," From
speech of Gen. G. JIT. Dodge in Congress, 1868,
The men who built this road
fought and worked by turn
inspired with a great ideal.
They spanned a continent with a trail
of blood and iron for the sake of
the Union and their road is the
Union Pacific.
The spirit of the build
ers is alive today in the
hearts ot the men who
labor to improve this
railroad nnd to conduct
its operations. They
work tocether for this
great property as for a
national institution. This
esprit de corps affects
favorably everyone who
comes in contact with
the Union Pacific as
traveler or shipper.
