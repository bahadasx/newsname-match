The Woodfield was sunk Nov. 3 last.
A list of the crew aboard showed a

connected with armament, except in

THE WAR TODAY
In Yolbjnia the Russians report

Austrian reports claim that the
Russians have been held to their
old positions in (alicia and on the
Bessarabian frontier.
Belgian officials announce that
there is no foundation for the re
cent reports that Germany recent
ly made peace proposals to the
Belgian government.
On the western front there have
been furious battles between the
French and Germans in the Artols
region of France.
On the east Galicia frontier the
Russians are on the offensive, but

Students at
NavySchool
Washington, Feb. 11.
Daniels today approved the recom
mendations of the academic" board at
the naval academy dismissing 82 mid
shipmen for failure in their studies.
Their names may be- made public
later,
Of those dismissed three are of the
first class, 19 of the second, 20 of the
third, and 40 of the fourth class. In
announcing his decision, Secretary
Daniels said that while the navy need
ed more officers, only those who could
meet the high standards and qualify
by examination could be retained.
"To meet this need," he said, "the
63rd congress, tin the recommendation
of the navy department, continued the
cach nleraber of congress, and the 64th
congress, as the first act in larger pre
paredness, has passed the bill giving
three appointments to each senator
and representative. This makes possi
ble an increase of 531 midshipmen for
the coming year."
WOMAN, INVALID
50 YEARS, DEAD
New York, Feb. 11. Miss Mollie
Fancher, who celebrated her "golden
jubilee" as an invalid eight days ago,
died today at her home in Brooklyn.
Miss Fancher was known all over
the world through the extraordinary
correspondence she built up during the
half century of her invalidism. Al
though bedridden and only able to
move her right arm, she worked un
ceasingly at knitting and embroider
ing. In 1866, when Miss Fancher was 17
years old and noted for her beauty,
she was thrown from her horse and
injured. A year later she was the vic
tim of a street car accident which de
prived her of the use of all her limbs
except her right arm.

ment in a sick room, Miss Fancher's
chief nourishment was the Juice of
fruits.

NEED MERCHANT FLEET
Speaking to the Commercial
. Delegates He Tells the
Necessity of Marine.
Washington, Feb. 11. Delegates to
the annual convention of the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States left
for their homes today carrying with
them a message from President Wil
son, the feature of which was his de
termination to keep the United States
out of the European conflict, although
he declared that the nation merely
held that trouble at arms' length.
The president was speaklne on neu
trality at the annual banquet of the
chamber which was a concluding fea
ture of a three days convention. The
president also spoke of the need of a
real scientific tariff board and a mer
chant marine.
"It is a cruel thing," said the presi
dent, "to have it supposed, as it is in
many quarters, that we have kept out
of this war simply because we wanted
to keep out of trouble and simply be
cause we wanted to profit by the trou
ble of others. I am not afraid of the
slow verdict of history with regard to
the neutrality of the United States, and
I believe that we are justified in exer
cising every degree of patience in mak
ing It clear what our position is and
how sincerely we are determined not
to allow this quarrel to become part of
ours.
Trouble at Ann's Length.
"I have only this to say, though. We
hold this trouble at arm's length and
keep or attempt to keep our own judg-j
ments cool, but the rest oi tne worm is
hot and it may be that any time with
out our cooperation and without our
ability to stop it, the flame may ex
tend to us. And therefore I am glad
that the United States has been put in
a position to mobilize its financial re
sources and to get into the position
which it must at last get into, whether
, it wants to or not.
If only we can Keep tnis great na
tion at peace there is an infinite pros
pect of happy prosperity before the
United States, not because others have
suffered, but because the United States
is ready to help, because the United
States Is ready to serve."
The president spoke of the federal
reserve law, saying:
"When you reflect what might have
happened If our banking system had at
the outset of this war been the clumsy
and antiquated thing that it was three :
years ago, you will realize that not
only might we not have escaped dis
aster, but the disaster might have been
so prolonged that it would have been
impossible for the United States to oc
cupy the position she now occupies."
Tells "eed of Merchant Marine.
The president told of the necessity of
a scientific tariff board and said he
thought the nation would get it
The president expressed the confi
dent hope that legislation creating a
merchant marine would be passed by
congress as Boon as possible, and
added:
"At any rate, while all the rest of
the world is at war, we cannot deliver
our goods in other people's ships, and
we have hopefully expected that ships
would be built by Americans, but there
have been no violent symptoms of that
prospect being realized, and It is ab
solutely necessary that we should
jmake a beginning in some way.
A year ago when the original ship-
nine bill was Introduced I was told
that a revolution of some sort was be
ing proposed. I am not afraid of any
kind of a revolution that is useful. I
do not care by what honest process
the goods are delivered but they have
got to be delivered. We cannot hold
our whole economic life stagnant be
cause we are afraid to try an experi
ment. I am not afraid to try any ex
periment, provided you put the trying
of It Into competent hands."

SECRETARY OF WAR
WHO HAS RESIGNED
Liadley Murray GarrUoa.
(Special to The Argus).
Washington, Feb. 11. Secretary
Garrison's resignation caused little
sorrow among members of congress
who are fighting for government man
ufacture of war materials. The retir
ing secretary was opposed to govern
ment manufacture. He was also
friendly to the Taylor system of shop
management He believed in compul
sory military training and was friendly
to the viewpoints of General Crozier.
Henry M. Pindell of Peoria, who has
been mentioned for the place of secre
tary of war, is an enthusiastic sup
porter of Representative Tavenner's
campaign for government manufacture
of war materials, and should he be ap
pointed it would be a great boon for
the Rock Island arsenal.
GARRISON LETTER
AND WILSON REPLY
Washington, D. C, Feb. 11. Secre
tary Garrison's letter of resignation
and the letter of Mr. Wilson accepting
it follow:
' "War Dejartit Washlsgtpn.p, C.,
Feb. 10, 1916. My Dear Mr. President:
I am just In receipt of yours of Feb.
10 in reply to mine of Feb. 9. It is
evident that we hopelessly disagree
upon what I conceive to be fundament
al principles. This makes manifest
the impropriety of my longer remain
ing your seeming representative wth
respect to these matters. I hereby
tender my resignation as secretary of
war, to take effect at your convenience.
"Sincerely yours,
"LIXDLEY H. GARRISON."
The president's reply follows:
"The White House, Washington, D.
C, Feb. 11. My Dear Mr. Secretary:
I must confess to feeling a very great
surprise at your letter of today offer
ing your resignation as secretary of
war. There has been no definite action
taken yet in either of the matters to
which your letter of yesterday referred.
The whole matter is under debate, and
all the influences that work for clarity
and judgment ought to be available at
this very time.
"But since you have felt obliged to
take this action and since it is evident
that your feeling in the matter is very
great, indeed, I feel that I would be
only imposing a burden upon you
should I urge you to retain the secre
taryship of war while I am endeavoring
to find a successor. I ought to relieve
you at once, and do hereby accept your
resignation because it is so evidently
your desire that I should do so.
"I cannot take this important step,
however, without expressing to you my
very warm appreciation of the distin
guished service you have rendered as
secretary of war, and I am sure that in
expressing this appreciation I am only
putting into words the Judgment of
our fellow citizens far and wide.
"With sincere regret at the action
you have felt constrained to take,
"Sincerely yours,

President Assumes Guidance
of Office Pending New
Appointment.
Washington, Feb. 11. Secretary
Garrison has resigned from the cab
inet because President Wilson declin
ed to insist without compromise on the
adoption of the continental army plan
by congress. The resignation was ten
dered and accepted yesterday, and
with Mr. Garrison, the assistant sec
retary of war, Henry C. Breckinridge,
left4he service of the government
The president finds himself today
personally in charge of the adminis
tration's plans for strengthening the
army and working out a definite mili
tary policy. He has not selected a
successor to Mr. Garrison and it Is re
garded as probable that even after the
new head of the war department is
named, the president will continue to
handle the preparedness plans to a
great extent by himself.
Resignation a Surprise.
Secretary Garrison's resignation
took official Washington by complete
surprise. Even members of the pres
ident's official family were unaware
of the secretary's contemplated action,
although one of them said, however,
that he knew Mr. Wilson and Mr. Garrison-
differed over the handling of the
army plans.
The reasons for Secretary Garri
son's resignation and its acceptance
by the president are disclosed in
lengthy correspondence made public
between them. The correspondence
revealed that while the secretary left
the cabinet principally because the
president would not "Irrevocably" sup
port the continental army plan, his
opposition to the administration's pro
gram for setting a definite time for
Filipino Independence, as outlined in
Senator Clark's amendment to the
Philllplne bill, was an Important fac
tor. The secretary characterized the
amendment as "an abandonment of the
duty of this nation and a breach of
trust for the Filipinos."
Garrison Flan Causes Break.
Secretary Garrison contended that
only a federal continental army In
stead of a recognized national guard
could be the main military depend
ence of the country, while the presi
dent contended that no one plan could
be enforced on congress. It was on
these two contentions that the break
between the president and his secre
tary of war came.
Assistant Secretary Breckinridge,
who shared Mr. Garrison's views, re
signed because of loyalty to his chief.
Major General Scott, chief of staff of
the army, automatically became sec
retary of war ad interim.
There was considerable speculation
here today over the possible succes
sor to Secretary Garrison. Those talk
ed of most prominently in that con
nection included Representative Sher
ley of Kentucky, chairman of the house
fortifications sub-committee; Secre
tary Lane of the interior department,
and Assistant Secretary Roosevelt of
the navy department
It is expected that the president will
appoint a successor immediately. It
Is understood that he wants a man al
ready familiar with the general de
tails of the military situation of the
country, so that plans for national de-
