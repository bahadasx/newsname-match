Koitok Independent:
Following up Btoriea of Arkansas
life, and especially of the doing of the
religious fanatics Buch as the Holy
Rollers and Holy Jumpers out -there,
.the following will be of interest as
Bhowing how easily people can' be
fooled by false prophets. The Mor
mons, with, their folderal "Bible" had
nothing on the eupersanctified "Eli
jah the Third," known, in common
eve'ry-day lingo as. Elijah Scagg3, a
black-haired, black-browed, sallow
man who sailed into Fort Smith, Ark.,
about eight years ago, claiming to be
the King of the Gentiles. ' He had
with him the runaway wife of an Ok
lahoma lawyer, whom he fondly intro
duced as the Queen of the Gentiles.
This royal pair, having no occupation
but the crazy '"preaching," ard no cap
ital but thir absurd claims of domin
ion over the Gentiles, lived on the fat
of the land. Within a couple of
weeks they had gathered at least one
hundred "disciples," and the ridiculous
movemont was growing at a great
rate, when something happened; one
' of the most amazing of all my expe
riences, and hardly to be placed among
the doings of a sane people.
"The Queen" rushed into the office
of a justice of the peace in Fort Smith
one afternoon, her hair flying loose,
her clothing torn.and her appearance
Bhowing great agitation. She exclaim
ed between hysterical sobs, that "the
King" (Elijah Scaggs) had committed
a criminal assault upon her, - Had she
been a woman of ordinary standing,
Elijah would have needeed no trial,
' but ten feet of rope would have towed
him across the dark river in a hurry.
As ib was, no one got excited, and
Elijah was quietly arrested and lodged
in jail on the warrant sworn out by
the woman. The case came to trial.
I was there, and saw the alleged
prophet seated in his corner, his hands
folded and his eyes raised to heaven
in martyr fashion, while a self-satisfied
smirk covered his sallow features.
Then the Queen, placed on the Btand
as the only witness againt him, cre
ated a sensation. She swore that
Elijah was perfectly innocent; "had
never laid the weight of his hand up
on her," and the charge against him
was utterly false. Elijah's lips moved
as if in prayer; and his smirk was im
mense. The judge, gasping with astonish
ment, asked the woman why she had
charged the man with this awful
crime, if he was innocent. She then
replied in a calm, even voice:
, "You see, Elijah, being the 'same
prophet as of old, come back to the
flesh, saw th,e world was being de
stroyed by sin, and that a sacrifice
was needed to save it. Since the
atonement by Christ, the world had
not appreciated the sacrifice, and is
now m wicked that another atone
ment it needed, and Elijah and I made
a covenant with each other that I
Bhould accuse him of a capital crime
and have him hung so as to save the
world from sin again. That is why I
had him arrested. But I can't stand
to see him treateJ that way when he
is not to blame, and I have decided to
tell the truth." ; . : " '
There Was silence in the court-room
for a minute, or so, and there was
whispering among the officials as to
what to do. Elijah enjoyed the scene
imniensely, hia lips wobbling incess
antly and his thumbs twirling with
satisfaction. But his joy was soon
overcast, for the judge in a few sharp
words ordered his Queen held for per
jury, and sentenced Elijah himself to
imprisonment at hard labor for life in
the state penitentiary. Then Elijah's
Banctified smile gave way to a sorry
grin, and his face sunk lower t till no
ontfcould see it. The woman was
hi fried away to one coll and he to an
pr. I saw him a few minutes
FUelb'ard. He was crying like a
?;hipid child. ,
"I was ready to die for this here
sinful old world," he whispered, "be
cause hit needs regeneration hit
shorely does. They mought-a hung
roe, and I wouldn't-a said a word, but
this here hard labor for life boo-hoo
-hoo! Hit's more'n I can stand!"
After he had calmed down a little,
Elijah told me he had first gotten re
ligion while plowing in his father's
corn-field In Logan county, Arkansas!
twenty yean before. H beard
voice talking out of a cloud which
said to him: -"Elijah, 'be thou my
prophet as of old,go forth and preach
my gospel to every . creature." "And
I left my plow with the mules hitched
to it right there in the fields and have
been preachin' every since." He said
he knew every verse in the Bible, and
it was wonderful, when I tried him,
to see how much he did know of the
"letter" of the Scriptures; in the
spirit of that great book he was in
some ways sadly behind.
Scaggs was taken to the peni
tentiary." He did not believe he would
be put to hard labor till they began
to shear off his long black hair and
measure him for his convict stripes.
Then he bawled like a baby with the
colic, so the papers suid. The Elijah
of old was fed by the birds with the
manna of the Lord ; here was Elijah
the Third condemned to still his crav
ings with corn pone, sow-belly bacon
and black-strap molasses, and work
ten hours a day at breaking rock on
the Arkansas ' roads. Elijah called
down the thunders of Sinai on the
heads of the wicked authorities, and
at last his prayers were heard. Gov
ernor Donaghey was called out of the
state on some errand for a week or
two, and as soon as he was of, Lieu
tenant Governor Harameter signed an
order releasing Scaggs, and declaring
that his conviction and imprisonment
was "a blot on the state." Aud bo it
was, for the only witness against him
was the woman who afterward swore
that he was innocent.' But the Fort
Smith people were tired of his antics,
and took that way to get rid of him.
As soon as he got out of the peni
tentiary, Scaggs went to preaching
his "doctrines with redoubled yigor,
calling down the wrath of heaven
upon all who failed to help him and
his cause. Ona man who had refused
him shelter had a big barn. Scaggs
predicted the barn would burn down
within a week. The citizens saw the
dangerous trend of his ideas, and gave
him a tremendous flogging, with iron
trace-chains. Then the fiery prophet
shook the dust of the state from his
feet, and I never heard any more
about the doings of the luckless queen
and king of the Gentiles.
Civilization has advanced too far in
Arkansas for these loony evangelists
to make much headway. The metal
grass is not dry enough to take fire
from such religious zeal." But it is
not of the type that relishes the high
flown eloquence of the Eastern reviv
alists, either, and I doubt if Talmage
or Moody would have made much of
an impression at Fort Smith. I heard
the great evangelist, Torrey, deliver
a discourse there that was wonderful,
especially for its enlightening refer
ences to the revelations of modern
science. He said, among other things,
the following: '
"What is man, that God is mindful
of him? On this earth there are fif
teen hundred millions of human beings
today. This earth itself is so small
that one million, four hundred thous
and balls of its size could find room
inside the sun, if it were a hollow
ball. 'And there are at least a million
suns larger than ours, in the visible
universe, to say nothing of the invis
ible works of God-r-invisible to uf,
and yet there may be a thousand uni
verses of whose existence we do not
dream." Wonderful ideas, not idle
speculations, but the gleanings of
modern science! And yet he did not
draw big crowds. The people out
there are very conservative and prac
tical. I like them.
Sometime I may, ; If desired, tell
some interesting things about great
preachers and presidents I have seen.
When you get close to some of these
big people, they do not seem so big,
after all. A McNairy lady, on hear
ing Talmage preach, was much disap
pointed, and declared "she had heard
Brother Curry preach a much better
sermon than that, many a time.
When it came to pastoral visits, there
is no doubt whatever that Brother
Curry was far ahead of Dr. Talmage.
But that is another story. -

MODERN HOTEL
FOR SELMER.
Tentative steps are being taken to
build a modern two-story brick hotel
on the vacant lots adjoining the War
ren block. ' It will run back 105 feet
and be 110 feet front, with the front
reaching over the Warren block, giv
ing an entire block. A number of the
leading merchants and business men
are interested. Tho building is to be
complete with its own electric light
and water plant. We have long
needed a first class brick hotel in Sel
mer. The present hotel buildings
were built among the first buildings
of the town and are inadequate to
meet the demands of the traveling
public.
