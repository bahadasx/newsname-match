From New York to Cresco.
"Abe" Potash and "Mawruss" Perl
mutter come to "The Cresco" on Satur
day, Feb. 26th, when they will display
the latest designs in cloaks, suits and
laughs. They come direct from New
York where for two seasons they did a
rushing business at the Cohan Theatre
and on their staff are some of the
finest artists ever seen here.
"Abe" and "Mawruss," you know,
are the "fellers" that Montague Glass
who writes pieces for the Saturday
Evening Post made so famous. A
couple of million of people got to know
the boys well but it took A. H. Woods
to put them into business for them
selves and since then they've been work
ing over-time. The firm name is "Pot
ash & Perlmutter they got a designer
named Ruth Goldman who."has ahead
like Andrew Carnegie and a shape like
Lillian Russell a lawyer named Feld
man who would sue a plate of hash for
"unlawful combination," and incident
ally they have hearts of gold, which is
what causes all the trouble, and of
course if there wasn't trouble there
wouldn't be any play.
The story of "Potash and Perlmutter"
revolves about the efforts of the two
lovable partners to save their new book
keeper, Boris Andrieff, from the clutches
of the Russian Government. They
really know little about Boris except
that as a bookkeeper he is a great
musician and they quarrel incessantly
about him, but when there is danger
that the young man is to be sent back
to Russia and perhaps a Siberian prison
they risk every cent to save him. For
a time it looks as though the partners
would have to lose all through their
quixotic ideas, and Potash is going to
lose besides a desirable son-in-law—
when everything turns out happily.
Cupid has been busy, betimes, with
Potash's partner and so the ending is
doubly happy. There are tears as well
as laughter, tears that are quickly
chased away by smiles, for though
there is pathos in the play, there is also
a mine of mirth.
This delightful comedy will be pre
sented in Cresco by the splendid com
pany of artists who were seen in the
r.in New York, San Francisco,
now at
the Olympic in Chicago, and following
their Cresco appearance play week
stands at Minneapolis, St. Paul and
Milwaukee.
Potash & Perlmutter, in play-cast
and production, is equal, if not superior,
to any comedy on the road to-day.
See later papers for date of seat sale
which will be opened earlier than usual
on account of the interest and enthusi
asm manifested in this attraction.
Rani Carriers Do Big Business.
Few patrons of the postoffice de
partment realize the volume of busi
ness transacted by this branch of the
government nor do the patrons of a
postoffice appreciate the amount of
mail matter handled in the office or by
its carriers.
During the month of January all ru
ral carriers counted and weighed all
mail delivered and collected. The eight
carriers from the Cresco office deliver
ed a total of 62736 pieces, weighing
11,736 pounds and collected 7607 pieces
weighing 509 pounds, a total of 70343
pieces handled and a total weight of
12245 pounds. This is the normal
amount of mail handled for thi3 season
and included nothing out of the ordi
nary run of mail handled except about
300 pieces of parcel post which weigh
ed about 1350 pounds. The Cresco car
rier handling the smallest amount of
mail delivered 6066 pieces and collected
768 pieces with a total weight of 1348
pounds. The greatest number deliver
ed by any one carrier was 10551 pieces.
He collected 1329 pieces and the total
weight of mail handed was 1804 pounds.
Of the total pieces of mail handled,
there were 22237 letters and post cards,
32349 newspapers and magazines, 6515
pieces of third class matter and 9065
pieces of parcel post matter.

A Business Change.
A deal was closed last week in which
W. F. Allen sold his shoe store toCoun
ty Recorder Ed Weaklen and Elmer
Davis, and on Monday of this week the
work of invoicing was commenced. The
new proprietors are not new to the
business, Mr. Weaklen having for seve
ral years before his election as County
Recorder worked in different
Cresco stores, the last employer having
been Mr. O'Malley. Mr. Davis has for
several years been at work in the Hub
Clothing Store. Since Mr. Allen's ar
rival in Cresco about sixteen years ago
he has built up a fine business, and in
selling has nothing particularly in view
but an opportunity to secure a much
needed rest for a time from business,
and for the present at least will retain
his residence in Cresco.

Bishop Quayle to Lecture in Cresco
Pastor Kirwin announces that he has
secured Bishop Wm. A. Quayle, one of
the greatest Bishops of the Methodist
Church, to lecture in Cresco «n Wed

remember that the Bishop was here
several years ago at the Chautauqua

greatest lecturers ever heard here.
There is only one Quayle, the big,
square shouldered, curly haired Scot
ish man, bubbling over with fun and wit,
keen and clear in thought, with an elo
quence that holds you spellbound. You
feel that you have been to a feast of
seven courses when you have spent an
evening with him. You can't afford to
miss an fopportunity to sit under his
spell and drink in the inspiration that
he always brings. March 1st.

to Wm. Huckins in 1857 at Castalia,
Iowa, and came to Howard county to
live. She was baptised and joined the
Methodist church in 1892 at the Paris
church south of town. To Mr. and
Mrs. Huckins were born eleven chil
dren, five of whom have passed away.

Rural School Notes.
Following this week's twp. contests
will be held the county contest at the
High School, Friday, Feb. 18. Th©
Farmers' Institute Committee has ar
ranged to give the entire day of the
18th to different phases of rural educa
tion. Look at the Institute program.
Prof. H. H. Gibson from Ames will
lecture both morning and afternoon and
will act as judge of contest in the ev*
ening. He is intensely interested in
the subjects which he presents and, if
you will notice the Institute program,
you will see that his subjects are of vi
tal importance to the farmer and his
boys and girls.
I believe that every rural school with
in reach of Cresco should be closed on
that day and the teachers, parents and
pupils present at the Institute. If ft is
possible for only the teacher to be pres
ent it will pay to close the school. If
you are here at all you should be out
for the morning session. If the farm
ers of Howard County realize how much
the county agent is doing in some coun
ties, all counties that have an agent,
they would hesitate to miss Friday
morning's session.
Monday and Tuesday, Jan. 31 and

ard County selected the following text
