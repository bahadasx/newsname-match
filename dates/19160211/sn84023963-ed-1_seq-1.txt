Mary's Wedding.
A Maryland man recently mar
ried off his fourth daughter, the
ceremonies touching whose wedding
were given much attention by the
"society editors" of the country pa
pers in that region.
A week or two after the wedding
a friend who had been north for
some time met the father, to whom
he made some jocular reference in
regard to the recent "event."' "1
see by one paper," said he, "that

In South, America is to be found
a bird from which a species tit but
ttr can be obtained. This animal
ia known as th "oil bird," and ono
of its favorite haunts is the island
of Trinidad. It breeds in rocky
caves on the mainland, laying its
aggs in a nest constructed of mud.
The young birds are extraordinari
ly fat, and the fat, having been t
melted down in clay pots, producea j
a kma of butter, says .London ltt
Bits. This: butter is used by the
natives. T4he caves inhabited by
theso oil birids are usually accessible
only from the sea, and the hunting
of these feathered creatures fre
quently affords exciting sport to
toe advantums in spirit.

lived on atewed chops arid rice for
luncheon and dinner, wiüi tea, for
a couple of years, but ordinarily he
was a great feeder.
