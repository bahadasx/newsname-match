"Welborne, who was present, to ex
press his views on the subject.
Judge Welbourne said, in part, that

modern fire-fighting apparatus, but
that he believed It. behooved the

of the law in the manner In which

bolond the pale of legality In the

that tho supreme court of Oklahoma

CRUEL WAR -IS
NOW ON
Judging from the appearance of the
police court docket this morning, the
"war Is on." The ' Big Chief," it
seems has talked and given out inter
views and borne with patience the
speeding and jaying bug which seems
to have bitten the auto public of
Chickasha, with tha idea of permeat
ing the back partof his head that the
traffic ordinances would, in course of
time, be observed; intil at last ho
found, seemingly, that patience some
times ceases to be a virtue and, like
unto the fabled worm, has turned.
This morniirc'8 police record of
"fines and punishments" carries tha
following information : Howell, cut
ting corners, fine $3; Buie, joy cut

By luited Press.
NEW YORK, Feb. 11.
Former -Secretary of War Gar
rison, In tho first statement
he has Issued since he re
signed, says he has retired
from politics. He says he 4
"could not conceive of taking
thu .itump against Wilson."
By United Press.
WASHI'v'GTONT, D. C, Feb. 11.
"Garrison's resignation will have no
effect on congress."
This wjs the declaration today ot
Chairman Hay of the house committee
on military affairs.
Hay's conimitte was the storm cen
ter in the controversy which caused
the summary withdrawal of Garrison
from the cabinet.
Chairman Hay would not discuss
the disputes affectiag himself and
Garrison, but he said the committee
would go ahead with its own program
of army reorganization.
Announcement of the appointment
cf the successor of Garrison may be
made within 24 hours. It is certain
that he will be a Democrat. This in
formation comes from the White
House.
Those close to the president declare
that no man thus far mentioned will
be given the portfolio. The president
has decided, however, that, political
and legislative necessity requires the
promp filling of the vacancy.
A score of Democratic notables
have been mentioned in the gosaip
regarding the place. Prominent among
them are Secretary Lane, Henry Pin
dall, the Peoria editor; Congressman
Sherley of Kentucky, Assistant Sec
retary of Navy Roosevelt, former
Governor Walsh of Massachusetts
former Governor Harmon of Ohio and
former Governor Adams of Colorado.
It can be authoritatively stated that
Col. Goethals is not being considered
The next secretary must be a man
who can work with Chairman Hay, it
is asserted on authority.
t The question of a successor to As
sistant Secretary . Breckenridge, who
resigned in sympathy with his chief,
will also probably be settled soon.
President Wilson today Issued an
order designating Major General
Scott, chief of staff, to act as secre
tary ot war for a "period not to
exceed thirty days or until his suc
cessor is appointed and qualified."
The resignation of Secretary Gar
rison was announced late yesterday.
The reason iven was the refusal o
the president, to "irrevocably" sut.pnrt
the continental army plan to which
the secretary of war was committed
and opposition ot Garrison to the
plan of setting a' definite date for
granting independence to the Philip
pines. The resignation of both Garrison
and Assistant Secretary of War
Breckenridge were accepted by the
president.
Tho circumstances which led up to
the resignation are declared in the
secretary's correspondence with .the
president which was made public
Thursday night by the White House.
The president, the letters disclose, bo
lieves that the traxtng, organization
and control of a military reserve
Rhonld be tinder immediate federal di
rection, but Is not "irrevocably
dogmatically committed to any
or
on
plan."
He wrote Mr. Garrison that he could
,v cnoHfje- rlan on con
gress and added:
"I must welcome a frank Inter
change of views and a patient and
thorough comparison of 11 the meth
ods proposed for obtaining the ob
jects we all have In view." ,
Mr. Garrison's contentions that only
the plans of the war department
could be considered Eeemed to the
president "wholly unjustifiable." Mr.
Garrison considered "reliance upon
the militia for national defense an
unjustifiable and imperilling of the
nation's safety." In resigning he
wrote the president:
"It Is evident that we hopelessly
disagree upon what I conceive to hn
fundamental principles."

SUGGESTS RAISING
FUND OF 50 MILLIONS
Thinks Men Who Make Money Out of
Munitions Should Aid in Repairing
Ravages of War; Europe Would
Welcome Move
By CHARLES P. STEWART..
(United Press Star.' Correspondent.)
THK HAGUE, Jan. 20. (By Mail.)
Judge Ben LIndsey of Denver hm
split off from what is left of the Ford
party to start a war relief campaign
of his own. The judge went into de
tail about the plan today. Originally
it was Mrs. Lindsey's Idea but the
Judge has made it also his and they
will push it together. The Lindseys"
proposition is to find homeg for war
orphans.
Incidentally they hope to find an
tpportunKy to develop a movement to
ward ending the war itself. Quite
frankly, they came with the Ford
party mainly in the hope that associa
tion with Ford would give them an op
portunity to interest the automobile
maker in their enterprise.
"The end of tu Xinoleonic wars
found countless thousands of orphans
in institutions,'' says the Judge,
"doomed to grow up without home
Influence, alone In the world, often
ill-treated and unaer circumstances
genrally which could not but dwarf
development and embitter their -fives.
The present war Is so muich greater
that the situation must be still worse
unless remedial steps are taken oc
a huge scale.
"Already It Is terrible. The stories
1 have heard are almost beyond be
lief, yet most of them undoubtedly are
true. As I have not yet been able to
verify Individual cases I am not ready
to give them out, but my first work
will be to compile a long list of then',
fully authenticated, as proof of the
necessity for a vast home-finding cam
paign." The Lindseys will peek funds wher
ever they are to be had, but it is to
American munition makers, as the
war's chief beneficiaries, that they
look for their biggest contributions.
"I have never agreed," says the
judge, "with those who think our
munition . makers have done wrong.
It's my view that so long 83 there was
a war, they had a right to sell their
product to anyone who wanted It.
However, I do feel sure under the cii
eumstauces that they will be glad to
give freely to help the orphans the
war has made."
Fifty million dollars is the sum
Judge Dindnoy suggests tentatively
as an adequate fund for the home
finding plan.
"Probably it will take two or three
years," he admits, "to raise so much,
but it ought to be possible to,raiso
enough for a start on a large scale
within, say, six months. Naturally
our work will lead us into relations
with the belligerent governments and
I think it more than likely we may
thus find an opportunity to make
peace suggestions. It must be taken
into consideration that we will engage
in a concrete good work, which the
government unquestionably will ap
preciate, so we shall not be on the
same footing as the present expedi
tion. "Clearly, too, it is a move the war
ring countries must welcome, for with
the terrible burden of taxation they
will have to bear after the war It wi.i
be Impossible for them to do much
relief work of their own."
"The belligerents would never con
sent to the transfer of large numbers
of their children to other lands, nor
would it be for the good of the chil
dren or ot the world at large. Where
possible the aim must be to help war
widows keep their children together.
For little ones who have lost both
fathers and mothers, homes must be
found In other families. There will
have to bo close supervision, that e
may be sure our ward-i are wen careu
