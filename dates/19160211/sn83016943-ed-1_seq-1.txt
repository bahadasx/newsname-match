The Coming Canvass.
In less than six months the
voters of the country will know
who will be the two leading can
didates for the office of President
.of the United States.' Indeed,
they know now who one of them
will be, but as to the other there
is complete uncertainty, says an
exchange. ,
The known candidate of course
is that of the Democratic party.
No Democrat has croposed him
self, no Democrat h s been
"mentioned" by his friends, as
a possible opponent of the Presi
dent. Individual Democrats of
high standing have disagreed
with some of the President's pol
icies or disapproved some of his
actions; but none of them have
seriously opposed Wm. The ap
proval of Mr. Wil' 'n's course bv
his own party: as a whole has
been unusually siptere and hearty.
un tne Kepuoiican side ail is
obscure. It is not yet even
known whether there will be a
substantially complete reunion of
the forces that in 1912 fought
each other so savagely. There
may , be an artificial harmony;
there may be continued division
and rival candidates. Logically,
and in the. interest of. pure poli-
tics, there should be continued
division; for those who adhered
to the Republican party four
years ago, and those who broke
away from it, do not now, any
more than then, think alike on
public questions. ' If they should
act together on platform and can
didates, and should be successful
in the election, one wing or the
other would be doomed to disap
pointment. The alternative is
thit they should make a platform
and choose candidates so color-
jessas not to oitena eitner wing
ot 'tne party, in that case of
course neither wing would teful
ly content,
But logic is not going to de
termine the course of- Republi
cans and Progressives in the com
ing canvass. Political expedien
cy will govern the conduct of eacr
wing of the old Republican par
ty. No one knows to what ex
treme such expediency may lead,
There are many candidates for
the Republican nomination, some
eager and some reluctant. Five
of them are present members of
the Senate: Messrs. Borah,
Cummins, La Follette, Penrose
and Weeks. Others who have
been "mentioned" are former
Senators Burton and Root, form
er Vice-PresidentFairbanks, Gov
ernor Whitman and Mr. Justice
Hughes.
There is another name that
of one who can never be over
looked when the presidency is
discussed Theodore Roosevelt.
He would be a rash man who
should predict what part Mr.
Roosevelt will play in the coming
contest, for not even he , himself
knows what it will be. Neces
sarily his course will be governed
by circumstances; but no one who
has the slightest acquaintance
with the political history of the
last decade wili doubt that any
thing is possible except that Mr,
Roosevelt will become the Dem
ocratic candidate. That position
is pre-empted.
Thankful for John Sharp.
Every American caii thank his
stars that John Sharp Williams
sits in the. United States senate
today to tear awake the veil be
hind which Senator Hoke Smith
tries' to hide the motives that in
spire him, about which the truth
has not' been told in the senate
chamber. Senators Williams told
the naked truth when he laid the
blame for British infringement of
our neutral rights on the preced
ents we created during the civil
war. He also reminded us of the
futility of challenging the allies to
mortal combat with our scattered
little army of less than 90,000 men
and enough ammunition for our
coast defense guns to last three
quarters of an hour. T.7jw York

Thie Phase it Worth White.
Our new prohibition measures
proposes to limit the human
thirst to one quart every 15 con
secutive days a half gallon ship
mfnt each month.
Two years hence, perhaps, we
will have a prohibition bill put
ting the limit at one pint per
month. -
In 1920 we may expect a bill
fixing the limit at one drink per
week. And no doubt it will also
prescribe whether that drink
shall be taken straight or mixed.
We are not Drotestmcr acramst
this restrictive legislation, being
a total abstainer, but it does
seem that our prohibition friends,
while displaying so much zeal.
ought to consider some of the
common sense phases of the ques
tion,. ;.
For ' instance, why limit the
quantity and say nothing about
the quality?
Even a prohibitionist ought to
know that there's a vast differ
ence in brands of whiskey, and
that something ought to be done
towards improying the quality of
the stuff.
Why fix the limit at a half gal-

We are in receipt of the official pro
gram of the 25th Annual Reunion of
the Mississippi Division of the United
Confederate Veterans, held at Biloxi,
Mies., Sept. 28th, 1915, which contains
a resolution by the United Daughters
of the Confederacy, commanding Dr.
Dunbar Rowland and the trustees of
the Department of Archives and His
tory for the tribute paid to the private
"Mr. Bryan' conduct as head
of the State Department smack
ed of disloyalty." Cleveland

Oh, nb, just plain, k,ig-headed
and pig-headed vanity, and bow

ism. Pecksniff crossed on Amin-

Ion when it is possible to buy Confederate Soldier by giving a place
certain brands that, after imbib
ing just one drink, a man is seiz
ed with an irresistable yearning
to go out and chuck brickbats at
his grandmother's tombstone,
while one drink of another brand
makes him shed tears of grati
tude pp. the shirt-bosom of his
bitterest enemy.
In other words, gentlemen of
the Legislature, if you are going
to enact constructive legislation,
the question of quality is entitled
to just as much serious consider
ation as that of quantity. You
have been notoriously negligent
in dealing with this phase of the
matter. Pure food laws, feed
inspection statutes, and kindred
measures galore have been put
on the . law books, presumably
for the protection of the people
but nary a sylk-tye has been
written to improve the brand of
liquor consumed by the people of
our state. Persons who ought to
know whereof they speak solemn
ly, declare that, because of, vour
negligence in this regard, the
quality of liquor sold in Missis
sippi has been steadily growing
from bad to worse until it is now
next to impossible to buy a brand
that is not mixed with red ink,
furniture polish, hair oil and
aqua fortis. One drink of that
sort of stuff, if poured on a cou
ple of dead cats, would imme
diately set them to fighting each
other.
Get your minds off of the ques
tion of quantity, gentlemen, and
give some serious consideration
to the matter of quality, Jack
son News.
Mississippi Farm Notes.
Humus in a soil increases the
water holding capacity, improes
the tilth, prevents extremes in
temperature, makes a home for
the soil bacteria and is a store
house for plant food.
The object of terracing is to
get the water that is not needed
off the land and get it off slowly.
The terrace is a shallow ditch
with a bank that catches tke
water and conveys it to an out
let or open ditch.
Keep the farm machinery new
by paint and protection from
weather. Have new plows each
spring out of the old ones. It
costs little to paint the farm im
plements. Ordinary carriage
paints will serve excellent for
this purpose. They are inexpen
sive and can be bought in every
town.
Soybeans seem to be one of the
most promising crops before the
Southern farmer. Every parti
cle of the plant has economic
values, and a great number of
commercial products are produc
ed from the seed. It seems that
the machinery of our cottonseed
oil mills is suited to the manufac
ture, of soybean meal and oil.
The soybean straw is a good
stock food and the fertilizer re
sulting from feeding the plant is
of much value, The roots and
nodules left in the soil improves
the fertility. Millions of acres
of land hitherto barren and un
productive may be restored to its
virgin fertility by proper Use of
this plant and a nominal expense
for prosphatic fertilizers,
in the Hall of Fame to the portrait of
Private E. D. Cavett. The resolution
was heartily adopted by the U. C Vs.
Before accepting this portrait to rep
resent the private soldier of the Con
federacy, Dr. Dunbar Rowland examin
ed the' record and found Em met t in
every way worthy of this honor that
he participated in every march, skirm
ish and battle in which his command
had been engaged; that he never had a
furlough until after the battle of Get
tysburg; that he was faithful to the
end, and his chivalrous deeds had been
commented upon by his commanding
officers, H is furlough is in the Archives
of the State.
There have been many enconiums
written of Emmett; to Bay any more is
like carrying' "Coal to New Castle;"
this prestige, however, excels all oth
ers. Emmett is, perhaps, the best
known veteran in the state, and he is
. . v .. .. . .
mucii t'eijen.. v or several terms he
represented his county in the Legisla
ture, where he was considered by his
constituencies as a forcible and fear
less advocate far good.
In the days of reconstruction, when
the carpet baggers were in control of
our commonwealth, Emmett rendered
valiant service in restoring white su
premacy. At the last state reunion, Emmett,
although absent, was elected by his
comrades Brigadier-General in the or
ganization of the United Confederate
Veterans.
We do not want him to fall into a
state of desuetude; we want our poster
ity to know him,1 and his portrait in the
Hall of Fame will be a factor condu
cive to this; In the future, when our
grandchildren, some of whom are nat
ive Mississippians, may chance to be
in the Hall of Fame, will point to this
portrait and say, "He is a friend of our
grandparents, and we have in our pos
session a paper written by them, stat
ing his indubitable claims to this
honor."
"When the shadows lengthen, and
the evening comes, and the busy world
is hushed, and the fever of life is over,
and our work is done, and then, ah!
then, like other men we cease to wand
er, cease to weep," Emmett will go
hence with the Cross of Honor ion ;his
breast, and the drapery of Confeder
ate colors about him, he will be:
Like a warrior taking hii rest,
With his martial cloak around him."

classy appearance. It will go any place that any large automobile
can go and many places that the larger automobile can not go. Its
efficiency is proven by its highest power per weight ; its greater
strength per weight; its high speed with maxium safety, and its stand
ardized construction throughout. It is ideally "non-skid" and it
cannot overturn. It is unsurpassed in "get-about ability." This car
has made good in 44 different states and 7 foreign countries. It is the
best money value in the motor vehicle t eld.
Mobilette users are enthusiastic and report
45 to 52 miles per gallon of gasoline.
The Mobilette is the most economical automobile on the market
