GEN-SCOTT SUCCEEDS GARRISON
SENATE HABIT
OF SECRECY IS
UNDER ATTACK
By Gilson Gardner.
WASIIINC.TON.O. D. C Feb.
11. —A tremendous struggle to
overthrow the ancient method of
doing things in the dark la im
pending in the U, S. senate.
The "executive session is us?d
to prevent the public from hear

tioiiß of appointees selected by
the president, nnd the set-ret roll
call which determines whether :i

Is one method of dodging respon

tomes to Head in Kuhlce Matter.
The fight to abolish the secret
executive session has reached _
climax in the case of the appoint
ment of George Rublee to the fed
eral trade commission.
Rublee was selected by Presi
dent Wilson last summer whip*
congress was not in session. Now
the senate must confirm or reject
his appointment-
Senator Uallinger of New
Hampshire (the state from which
Rublee was appoiuted) has as
serted hie "rights'' as a senator
to oppose Rublee because the lat
ter is "personally objectionable.''
Under the pleasant fiction known
as "senatorial courtesy," It Is
usual to refuse confirmation to
any appointee who is "personally
objectionable" to another senator.
What Polls Shows.
If. however, a record roll call
vote could bo secured on any ap
pointee, senators would not date
to vote against a good appoint
ment merely because some sena
tor demanded It as a "courtesy."
Roller Skating Club's
Season, Like All Other
Good Things, Has End
By D'Loss Sutherland
The grand high jinks of the
Roller Skating club No. 4 of 'he
African Methodist Episcopal
church came to an end last night
amidst the soothing strains of
"Tipperary" on the concertino i,i
Marse Hall's rink.
The club had been skating all

A special night has been kept

Lee Rucker, Ray Robsen, Ever

Mali Lord, how them boys could

They arrived early to get the

prepare for the difficult task of
showing some of the feminine
members the Dutch Roll and oth

They cavorted around like
Pavlowa or Charlotte, the Teu

sometimes on two and sometimes
where their skates weren't. The
early gatherers congregated near
the large stove and from this

The Tacoma Times
I have just polled the entire
senate on the question of whether
the senators will favor making the

matter of public record, as was
done once before in the case of
W'lnthrop More Daniels through a
fight forced by a few progressive
senators who refused to be bourtl

She was dressed just like the

At eight bells, a gong was rung
and the skaters slipped into low.
The concertino banged into
"Tulip Time In Holland" and

Amidst much kidding and

The kaiser's son has just written a wonderful de

tremendous onslaught where, he says, French spirit

he left Tacoma. His wife is be
