fenses of Oahu can communicate with
other forts on the island. He said
Oahu's land defenses offer a fine field
for laying out an electrical communi

A feature of the system , planned is
that it will Include underground tele
phone lines to various points where
defending troops will be located in
the event ef an invading force landing
on the island. This division will con
sist of a modern field trench 'phone
aystem, a duplicate of that now being
used successfully in the European war
cone for trench communication by
both the Teutonic and Entente Allies.

This was the final word of, Paul
Super, former general secretary of the
local ; Y. M. C. A. in a speech made
At a noon luncheon in Cooke hall to
day, tendered in his honor by the as
sociation directors. V : . w
Stanch backing of the boys' vaca
tion school, the night school, and tha
coming trade school, was urged in Mr.
Super's talk, together with the adop
tion of the metropolitan plan of bring
ing all Y. M. C. A.-organizations of
the, city under , the control of a di
rectorate. , ' -''
"We have three great Industries ia
Hawaii," Super declared, "the. sugar
industry, the pineapple industry, and
the industry of making manhood.
Let's put ourselves into this last with
all the force we canV - . '
The speaker did not urge an ' in
crease over the present membershln
of 1 19, but emphasized the fact that
more of the present members should
be working on committees. There art
only 216 such men now, he said, when
there should be from 500 to 600., He
urged the directors to back the pres
ent reputation of the local association
for-training secretaries on the fello-v
ship plan.. -: : :' ' - . t -r ''
People ask me sometimes if our
staff Is cot large and if we could not
get alcng on a smaller one," Mr. Super
said. "My answer is that we could
get along on a smaller staff but the
Y. M. C A. is not a concrete building;
it is an investment of personality.
and should therefore, employ . many
men to engage in Its many activities."
super urged constant backing of his
staff, wuich he declared is, well train
ed in the technique of the association
well educated, and of much ability.
He aald that the present debt of
$7300 for the swimming pool and arte
sian well should be wiped out by April
30, the end of the fiscal year. .
