TENTATIVE IE FOR COMING CAMPAIGN
The List Looks Like a Good Strong One With Little
Possibility of There Being Any
Preliminary Fight
A dispatch from Phoenix headed
"Arizona G. 0. P. Slate , Prepared;
Tentative State Ticket Is Selected As
Feeler, But Is Subject to Changes,"
says:
Here is just about the way the Ari
zona Republican ticket is going to
look this year:
U. S. Senator, Joseph H. Kibbey,
Phoenix.
Congressman, J. Knox Corbett,
Tucson.
Governor, Thomas E. Campbell,
Prescott.
Secretary of State, Ralph G. Whit
marsh, Phoenix.
Auditor, Joe V. Prochaska, Miami.
Treasurer, J. Myron Alfred, Saf
ford. Corporation commissioner, Thomas
Mnddock, Williams. '
Attorney general, E. S Clark, Pres
cott. School superintendent, Charles F.
Philbrook, Bisbee.
Tax commissioner, Rudolph Kuch
ler, Glendale.
Supreme judge, Frank 0. Smith,
trescott.
Mine inspector, J. M. Smith, Bisbee.
This is the slate. It is tentative and
several changes are almost sure to be
made. But the leaders, in organizing
the G. 0. P. throughout the state, are
going on the theory that these men
will be candidates at the primaries.
They are accepting suggestions from
no matter what source. They accept
ed and considered many suggestions
before they decided to put forth the
above ticket as a 'feeler. 4
Care Taken to Pick Good Ones
The greatest of care has been exer
cised to select men who are not only
popular and good fampaignera, ljt
who are competent to fill the .offices.
A number of disinterested parties,
personaly acquainted with practically
all the candidates, are of the opinion
that it would be hard to put forth a
ticket more likely to get the support
of voters. Kibbey, Campbell, Procha
ska, Philbrook and the two Smiths are
perhaps the strongest men on the sug
gested ticket but not one is a ''weak
sister."
One Question Settled
The leaders debated long and earn
estly whether it would be wiser to run
Kibbey or Campbell for governor. This
matter was decided by the men them
selves, Kibbey was governor of Ari
zona in territorial days and would
rather go to Washington than back to
that office. Campbell believes that he
would have little opportunity to serve
Arizona in the senate and stated posi
tively that he would be a candidate
for governor or nothing. So it was
settled.
It is quite possible that Kibbey
will not be the only person to go be
fore the Republican voters at the pri
maries as a candidate for senator, Ro
bert E. Morrison, of Prescott, has an
nounced that he would like very much
to bo senator.
Kibbey is willing. "We want the
strongest candidates we can get and
If Mr. Morrison can get more votes
at the primaries it is likely that he
can get more at the election," re
marked Kibbey.
Campbell Wants Clear Tield
Campbell, on the other hand, in
sists that he be not opposed at the
primaries. He wants to feel sure that
there is a general demand for his
services in the governor's chairf
J. Knox Corbett has not figured un
til recently in the plans of the Repub
licans. Fqr a number of years he was
postmaster of Tucson and he is strong
throughout the southern counties. In
the north he is not so well known, but
he is a good CE.mpaigner and a first
class 'mixer."
Ralph G. Whitmarsh has been sug
gested frequently ever since the last
election as the most available candi
date for secretary of State. He is
handicaped by limited acquaintance
outside of Maricopa county but he is
well known here. For a long time he
was secretary of the Arizona Taxpay
ers' Association.
Joe V. Prochaska is probably as
popular as any nan in Arizona. He
has been postmaster of Miami and
president of the Elks' Reunion Asso
ciation of Arizona.
J. Myron Allred is assessor of Gra
ham county and his ability in financial
affairs Is generally recognized.
Maddock Not Eager
Thomas Maddock is a railroad con
tractor with a big business and does
not want to hold any state office. If
he is nominated for the corporation
commission he will make the race but
he would much rather havo the Re
publicans persuade Fred Breen, of
Flagstaff, or some other strong north
ern man to take his place on the tick
et. E. S. Clark was once United States
attorney for Arizona. He is progres
sive in his tendencies and enjoys a
wide acquaintance. Charles F. Phil
brook is superintendent of the Bisbee
schools and one of the leading edu
cators of Arizona. Rudolph Kuchler
has been president of the Taxpayers'
Association since its organization.
Frank 0. Smith is Superior judge of
Yavapai county. ' J. M. Smith is better
known as 'Fatty" Smith .He is a fore
man in the Copper Queen mine at Bis
bee. Prescott Journal Miner.
SEDONA NEWS NOTES
Oak Creek has been very high the
past few days', in fact past fording.
It is rccceding rapidly.
Mr. Frank Owenby Sr., is very ill
and it is thought he is suffering from
a paryletie stroke and rheumatism
jointly.
The Verde river is reported as be
ing higher on the 27th and 28th of
January thrfn ever before recorded.
Reports of heavy rain and snow have
come from all directions.
Frank Thompson returned Thurs
day from Clarkdale where he has
been for supplies. His whole outfit
was bogged down n couple of times
but finally got home 0. K.
Again the sun smiles on the rocky
towers, cliffs and verdure-clad hills of
Sedona and the natives arc much
pleased for there has been little or.no
sunshine here for the past five weeks.
Ira Hart but lately a benedict has
arrived from a brief honeymoon and
is making his home in the Joe Lay
residence below Mr. Ed Hart's. We
offer our congratulations and many
years of happiness. ,
Work is progressing very satisfact
oraly on the excavation for the west
bridge abutment. The depth is now
20 feet and it is planned to go four
feet deeper as bed rock will be en
countered about that depth. -
The recent storm of the 20th of
January was very ljeavy on the moun
tain as reports came from Munds
Park by phone. There were 37 inches
of new snow setting it about 14 inch
es. This leaves in all old and new
snow at Munds Park about 50 inches.
There is lots of water under the snow
and the remaining snow is massed
like ice.
The first steam whistle heard on
Oak Creek was Jthe whistle on the
steam engine used in running the
pump at the bridge site. On the
fifteenth of January the engine was
connected with the centrifugal pump
keeping the water out of the excava
tion for the west abutment, It was
then it shrieked and whistled arous
ing the natives in all directions. At
last the novelty wore off and it set
tled down to business, one toot for
stop, two for go ahead, and three to
go slow. It blows C:30 a. m. to rouse
the slcping workmen and at 7:15 a.
m. it calls to breakfast and at noon
and evening it blows. We arc proud
of our one steam whistle on Oak
Creek.
Road Breaking a Strenuous Job
Fred Garing, the Coconino Dairy
man, reports some hardships in break
ing road through the deep snow to the
main road and to Flagstaff from his
dairy. He says that it took him two
days to break through one-half mile
of road, then sent a man to town on
skis for help. Mr. Bceson with 11
men and 8 horses and the A. L. & T.
with two men and teams from the
east end with four men and teams
from the west end finally managed to
break the road through. It was some
deep snow that will go down in the
annals of local history as things are
dated from "the time of the big wind
in Ireland." Mr. Garing says it crip
pled his dairy business for a time but
fortunately he had plenty of feed for
his stock and from now on will be
there with the goods.
NEW OFFICERS ELECIEO
TO THE BOARD OF TRADE
The regular monthly meeting of the
Flagstaff Board of Trade was held in
the town hall Tuesday evening and
new officers for the ensuing year elect
ed. They are as follows: J. W. Fran
cis, president; Wm. Becson, vice-president;
R. A. Morse, treasurer; W. E.
Berg, secretary; J. D. Guthrie, 0. II.
John and E. T. McGonigle were elect
ed to the board of directors.
A short report of the year's work
was made by the secretary, among
other things showjngSSS communica
tions received and 345 comunications
answered. One of the most beneficial
achievements of the organization was
the securing of the new road from
Winona to the Cliff Dwpllings. This
route tends to bring the auto tourists
through out city as heretofore they
have been taking the Canyon road at
Cliffs an1 passing up Flagstaff entire
ly. In anticipating the work for the
coming year it is hoped that the
Grand Canyon road may be brought
through the town and out over Schulz
Pass.
New Majestic Theatre
The old Babbitt garage building is
being fitted ud to be used by the
Majestic theatre as a picture show
house. The building is of cement, fire
proof and will be a neat, cosy, com
fortable theatre building when it is
completed and ready for use.
Cattle Losses Not Great
Dr. Looney of Prescott, and Nick
and Ben Perkins of Williams, were in
Flagstaff yesterday. They are inter
ested in the cattle business together
southwest of Williams. Nick says
that he has been hunting up stock on
snow shoes for a couple weeks and
succeeded in capturing a number of
horses by that method though he is
not inclined to favor the scheme all
winter long. He does not believe
their losses will amount a great deal
from the snow as most cattle and
horses had drifted down into the lowr
country.
Jesus Chaves Drowned
James Chaves, who is employed at
Babbitt Bros, received word Wednes
day morning from Camp Verde ad
vising him of the drowning of his
brother Jesus Chavis, and left on No.
9 for his home on Oak Creek.
The little boy was 7 years of age
and .was attempting to get his little
sister across Oak Creek a couple
miles below the Schuerman ranch
when he was swept from his feet by
the high waters of the creek and
drowned, while his little sister could
do nothing but witness his struggles
as he was sw'ept away.
The funeral services were held at
Clarkdale yesterday.
Sen ices in Commemoration of George
Washington
The first service, under the auspices
of the Mens Club of the Federated
church will be held Sunday evening
Feb. 20th in the Methodist church at
7:30 o'clock in commemoration of Geo.
Washington. Attorney C. B. Wilson
will be the speaker of the evening, the
subject being George Washington.
Every one is cordially invited. It is
the desire of the club to extend spe
cial invitation to the Masonic lodge to
attend in a body because of George
Washington having been so prominent
in masonry.
Nic Scitz for City Clerk
Nic Scitz is the latest candidate to
announce himself for the office of city
clerk at the city election to he held on
May 22nd, 1916.
Nic is a live, energetic young man
with plenty of ability to handle the
work of the office and has a large fol
lowing of friends among the young
people especially. He has made his
home in Flagstaff for the past ten
years where he has made good from
boyhood.
He is out after the vote and is not
afraid to ask for them and he will be
one of the candidates to be seriously
reckoned with in the race for the
place. '
Just Live Ones Did It
Just wondering what started that
comprehensible campaign of adver
tising now on by dairymen in Flag
staff. It's the proper caper, but a
trifle unusual. Phoenix State Herald.
Dam Bad
Globe passengers for Phoenix, over
the Apache trail, were compelled to

CONSERVATIVE MEN
NVEST AT
Mr. J. T. Burns, secretary and
manager of the Oatman Amalgamated
Gold Mining Co., was in Flgastaff
Tuesday, on business connected with
the development of that property in
the Oatman district.
Having passed through many min
ing fevers, Mr. Burns is conservative
relative to his particular mining pro
perty and the district in general. He
has a real, abiding faith in the dis
trict as a big producing country, but
is much set against claiming "there's
millions and millions in it," rather
taking the honest, conscientious view
that mining is mining, not a mere
process of developing a bunch of stock
holders.
While he has confidence in his judg
ment from previous mining expe
riences, including a diploma or two as
a mining engineer, he realizes that
there has been no x-ray process yet
invented by which a person can tell
what they are going to encounter in
the earth before digging, he believes
that his company has a splendid out
look on their properties. Machinery
has been ordered jto start active de
velopment work and the company is
sufficiently financed to sec their way
clear in going deep enough into the
earth to uncover the values that were
evidenced from discoveries of gold ore
already made. Mr. Bums left Tues
day evening forOatman to supervise
the construction of a cement building
for company offices and other pur
poses. Many prominent Flagstaff
business men are interested in this
company.
Great "Scoop" Indian Stories
Some of the stories sent out of the
"Indian Outbreak" at Tuba are won
derfully constructed productions that
would do credit to the Chicago Blade.
While the outbreak of a few renegade
1 Indians might result seriously to a
few people it was not an uprising of
' the whole Navajo or Moqui tribe as
.described by "scoop" artists in state
I papers. The Sun is not guilty of
seending any such dope out.
New Church at Winslow
Rev. W. B. Cole and W. A. Parr, of
Winslow, were in Flagstaff Thursday
conferring with the mills in regard to
lumber for the new Methodist church
at Winslow. Dr. Thos. Hambly, of
the Flagstaff Federated church, will
deliver an add ess at the laying of the
corner stone for the new building oi
the" 17th of ihis .nontb.
"The Sen ant in the House"
So many requests have come for a
repetition of "The Servant in the
House," given last week, as a church
benefit performance at Emerson hall,
that Director Thorpe and his cast have
consented to stage the play again next
Wednesday evening, February 16 at
Emerson hall. This great drama,
which took the theatre world by storm
upon its appearance, a few years ago,
was admirably interpreted, last Wed
nesday night by a group of picked
Flagstaff amateur actors so success
fully that a chorus of enthusiastic
praise has echoed and reechoed
throughout our city, resulting in a
demand fpr a second production of the
play.
"The sen'ant in the House" is an
exceptionally thrilling piece. It is
full of laughter and tears. Every
workingman should see this play, for
in it the diginity of honest toil is ex
alted; every professional man should
see it, because it proclaims the hol
lowness of empty ambition and the
glory of real achievement; every man,
woman, and child who cares for real
entertainment should sec it, for the
story is gripping, vital, intense a
story that holds you spellbound
throughout the evening. Do not miss
this final performance. Tickets are
now on sale at Marlar's drug store.
. Train Kills Two Burros
Two burros belonging to a prospect
or were killed last Saturday morning
by No. 8 just west of town. The pros
pector was using the track because
other roads had not been broken
through and claims to have traveled
on the tracks for over a hundred
miles. The animals wer caught in a
cut and were unable to get out of the
way when No. 8 came along.
Frank Parent walked in from A. L.
& T. camp 1 last- week and left Fri
day for the coast. A logging engine
was ditched in the snow about six
miles out on the road in an effort to
clear the track with a snow plow,
'consequently walking was the "only
means of getting into Flagstaff for
a few dayb at least.
KILLING OF NAVAJO INDIAN CAUSES
MUCH ANXIETY AMONG WHITES AT TUBA
White Indian Police Kill Renegade Navajo Leader While
Resisting Arrest Brothers of Dead Man Threaten
to Burn Agency and Kill Superintendent
The little settlement at Tuba is
very much stirred up and dire disaster
has been threatened white settlers by
a bad bunch of renegade Navajos.
The break between the whites and
Indians resulted over the killing of a
bad Indian whos name as near as i
could be ascertained is Tuddy Tin
who was killed by white Indian police
men a couple weeks ago in his ho
gan some distance from Tuba. The
Indian was wanted for some offense,
but refused to submit to arrest by In
dian police. The white policemen went
after him and found him in his hogan.
He defied them and started .unwrap
ping his six-shoote-. In his hurry he
did not completely unwrap the weapon
before attempting to use it. The
wrapping of rags caught in the ham
mer and it refused to work, though he
aimed it plumb center at the officer at
close range. One officer shot him
through the shoulder, but that did not
stop him; another shot struck him
lower down but failed to make him
quit; a third shot through the head
killed him instantly.
W. Dubree, construction engineer
and G. A. Seltz came in by auto Sat
urday as far as they could and walked
cighteecn miles through the deep
snow to reach Flagstaff and imme
diately wired the Commissioner of
Indian affairs at Washington of the
seriousness of the situation at Tuba.
The dead Indian has several broth
ers and was considered the leader of
a bad bunch of Indians who were not
taken into camp the last time the U.
S. cavalry went out into that country
to police them, consequently they feel
that they can do about as they please
and not suffer for their crimes.
The wife of the dead Indian de
mands trjc scalp of a white man to
pay for the death of her husband and
threats have been made against the
life of Supt Walter Runke and the
white policeman. Reports also were
brought in by friendly Indians that
the school buildings at Tuba would be
destroyed to prevent their children
from being sent to school.
"Big Sings" have been held for
several days and it is problematical
as to how many followers the leaders
may secure for a raid on the white
settlement which numbers all told
about fifty people, mainly women and
children.
The town would be practically de
fenseless as there are but few seme
able rifles in the town, while the In
dians are well armed with rifles and
ammunition.
A "big talk" has been proposed b
the Indians and Supt. Runke has ad
vised them that he will not talk to
them if they come armed. So far
Supt. Runke has not admitted that
there is any serious danger from the
Indians, but many residents have
grave fears of trouble and if it did
come, it would come suddenly with all
residents practically cut off from out
side help for at least two days.
Mr. Dubree gave the board of su
pervisors a complete history of the
case, which was coroberated .by others.
County Attorney Wilson wired U. S.
Attorney Flynn as to .authority for
temporary protection. Attorney Flynn
took the matter up with the depart-
j ment of Justice.
People who have had dealings with
Indians in that country for years and
who arc acquainted with the special
bunch of Indians involved in the trou
ble have grave fears for the outcome
of the affair and are inclined to be
lieve that they will have to be thor
oughly cleaned up by federal troops
before any permanent settlement of
the trouble is reached.
The Indian killed was a large pow
erful man, who, according to report,
has been having his own way for a
number of years, committing depreda
tions and violating all laws with im
punity. There is at present no means of
communication with Tuba except by
sled or wagon eighteen miles out
through the snow; from there the road
is in good condition. Mr. Dubree came
as far as the snow line in his auto
and walked the rest of the way into
Flagstaff.
The question of protecting the
whites was taken up by County At
torney Wilson with U. S. Attorney
Flynn who in turn took it up
with the department of Justice at
Washington The department ordered
U. S. Marshal Joe Dillon and Supt.
Thackery of the Sacaton agency to
investigate the matter and they ar
rived in Flagstaff Tuesday night ac
companied by U. S. Attorney Flynn.
After a conference here with Mr. Du
bree and local authorities. Marshal
Dillon, Supt. Thackery with Mr. Du
bree, Seltz, Dr. A. F Switzer and Wm.
Conley, started to the reservation.
The first prrt of the trip through the
snow was made with a four horse
team and sled with an auto loaded on
it From a point eighteen miles out
the trip by auto can be made in a few
hours.
U. S. Attorney Flynn waited over
until yesterday for an Indian inter
preter from Ft Defiance and then left
for the scene of the trouble.
From letters written by Supt. Run
ke to authorities he does not fear any
general uprising of the Indians but
does fear that trouble may be caused
by this special bunch of renegade In
dians who have been giving trouble
for sometime, and he corroborated the
story told by Dubree in a general
way, but thought he would be able to
handle the situation. Others felt that
the situation was too grave to take
any chances when the lives of so
many women and children were .at
stake.
A "Spitum" Goes With Printing Plant
Mr. Baca at Albuquerque, adver
tises a printing plant for sale and in
the list of articles is included 1 spit
um, 6 families of wood type, 2 asen
tadores, 3 keys for wedges, 4 ingots
of iron for the paper, 1 key for bolts,
10 galleys for paper, 8 chests for type,
6 chases for enclosing type. However
it must be a bum printing office that
couldn't own and control more than
just one measley "spitum."

I Hazardous Trip From Tuba
! Rev. J. W. Butler came in from
Tuba last week Thursday with his
family. Rev. Butler says the trip was
an exceedingly hazardous one and
they were compelled to camp out dur-
I ing the cold night when it was. 25
below here in Flagstaff. They made
along further next day and camped in
a vacant ranch house where their food
j supply was reduced to flap jacks
. straight, before they could possibly
make their way into Flagstaff by
team. They took in the Indian mail
carrier from Tuba and assisted him
in with his mail. He had started on
believing he could make it through
but was gone about a half a day when
he returned to their camp, both man
and horse completely fagged out ,
Regardless of the hardships on the
I way in Rev. Butler turned his team
toward Tuba Friday morning again
and started on his way to Tuba.
