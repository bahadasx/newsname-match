Will Pick Man to Run Nation's Mili
tary Affairs Within a Day; Garrison,
Following Split With President, Says
He Is Thru With Politics. 1
WASHINGTON. Feb. 11.—With <>en. Scott, chief of the
army staff, at ting as secretary of war, President Wilson today
considered successors for Secretary of War I.indlcy M. Gar
rison ami Assistant Secretary Breckcnridge, who quit their
posts last evening as a result of a disagreement with the presi
dent on preparedness.
Among those considered arc Secretary I-ane; Henry M.
Pindell of Peoria, 111 . once named as ambassador to Russia
but not appointed; Chairman Sherley of the house fortifica
tions committer, ex < »ov. Walsh of Massachusetts, and ex-
( «ov. Harmon «,f Ohio. One rejn>rt said I-ane would get
the portfolio and Jos. "leal of Portland would succeed
lane.
The White House made it known today that Garrison's
successor will be a man of great ability.
This man will l»e appointed within a day. He is likely
to be a "dark horse." the White House indicated, tho a crop
of "possibilities" were mentioned in official quarters.
It is almost certain that congress siyill pass the militia
plan in its preparedness program the idea that caused Gar
rison's resignation.
Chairman Hay of the house military committee said so
today, and Chairman Chamberlain of the senate military com
mittee indicated the same thing.
President'a Note Cause* Resignation
Ihe secretary regarded hit differences with Wilvm as
difference# in principle*, not merely in method* of achieving
adequate national defense.
. Tho <!>«« t«*d ''ten riinn.k tliat < arrison intended t«>
(fiftCVtaewrtt ft Uw the cfrftttnfnm army
■ p4«n he advocated. tHe immedi;we e»u«e of hi* resignation is
believed to le a note from the president regarding she speech
the secretary \\;.s scheduled to make last nifjht before the
Chamber of Commerce of the t'nited States. The note read:!
"You should feel no hesitation about expressing your
personal views on both subjects (preparedness and Philippine
independence), but I hope you will be kind enough to draw
very carefully the distinction between your individual prin
ciples and those of the administration."
Correspondence between the president and Garrison, made
public bv the White House following (iarrison*s resignation,
revealed that the president was not "irrevocably" committed'
to the continental army plan,
Call* Hay's Army Plan a "Mocker^*
(iarrison, on the other hand, insi-ted this was the only
means <•{ providing proper defense. He also was opposed
to the Clarke amendment to the Philippine bill, whereby in
dependence would be j-ranted the islands in two to (our years.
(iarrison, too, objected to the plan of Chairman Hay of
the house military committee, whereby the militia would be
federalized.
This scheme he suggested to he "mockery." while at the
•same time declaring that most of the members of congress
did not have the vital interest in military affairs required for
proper consideration.
Breckenridge's retirement followed C.arrison's a* a matter
of loyally He entertained the same views of the continental
plan a* did Garrison.
Yeaterday the secretary »ent hi*
r»«liniatlon. saving It wa». manifest
!y Improper for him to continue
when there wa* such a difference
befveen him *nd the president on
"f.tnnamenul principle's"
The pre*ldent expressed "very
great *urprl*e" when he accepted
the real ([nation, but *all he felt he
would merely lmpote an uddl'lonal
burden on Oarrlaon If he Inaltted
ott hi* remaining In the cabinet.
The two resignations were de
cided on suddenly.

Continental Plan Explained
Garrison did not plan to elim
inate the mint In nor to auhstltute
the continental srmy plnn for It.
Hut he did believe that his plan
for 400.000 volunteers, controlled
from Washington, would attract
young men who would not Join the
militia.
He planned to enlist 133,000
yearly for three years nnd to train
them under regular army officers
In summer camps iiear their
homes.
They were to receive the pay of
regulars.
