FIRST ANNUAL MEETING
GUN CLUB LAST SUNDAY
After the Shooting a Lunch Was Served
and All Round Good Time
Was Had
One who was there sends us the fol
lowing report of last Sunday's meet of
the Leavenworth Gun Club:
That nothing can dampen the ardor
of a true sportsmen was fully exempli
fied last Sunday when a score of the
members of the Gun Club betook them
selves to the club grounds for their
first annual shoot. To open the season
in a fitting manner arrangements were
made for a hot lunch. To get to the
grounds it was necessary to break trail
for quite a distance thru a bank of snow
seven feet deep. Here was where one
could fully appreciate the enthusiasm
of the true sport. First in line was W.
Van Brocklin carrying a 60-pound box
of shells on each shoulder. Following
close at his heels came Joe Hearst with
a cookstove lashed securely on his
back. Next in line was seen Sam
Daly with a 10-gallon can of water
perched jauntily on the tip of a shoul
der. Our genial tax-collector, Charley
Buttles, hearing that "Lifestaff" was to
be tabooed on the grounds, staggered
under a huge cauldron of buttermilk.
As C. Eckhardt passed in line it was
easy to infer by his smile of anticipa
tion that the bulging gunnysack slung
across his shoulders contained things
that were soon to gladden the stomach
of the most fastidious. After excavat
ing some nine feet thru the snow the
trap house was located and cleared,
and "squad up!" was called.
The day was ideal for shooting and
a general average of good scores was
made. Lunch was served at 12 o'clock
and be it to the eternal glory of Chef
Jay Buttles and his staff of cooks, the
repast was simply delicious. After the
tables were cleared some of the boys
enjoyed a sociable game of cards. To
say that the day was enjoyed by all
puts it mildly. So much enthusiasm
was injected into the meet that a num
ber of the older members made the
floor of the club house ring with an ex
hibition of one of their good old-time,
way-down South clapperflap-breakdown
clog dances.
The Eight Cylinder Club Meets
The Eight Cylinder Club met at the
home of John Mclntosh Wednesday at
a quarter to eight and departed at —.
The early part of the evening was spent
in playing cards- The champion card
players of the evening were Carl, Nor
man, John and Clifford, who outclassed
their opponents in every game played.
About 10:40 the bunch elected Max
as chief cook and Norman as flunky.
While Max and Norman did the cook
ing Clifford, the renowned tenor, sang
a solo while Harry tried to keep pace
with him by playing something on the
piano that sounded a little like "Get
the Hook." After that Carl and Harold
sang a duet which was exceedingly
well rendered.
After this torture was over we found
that Max and Norman had cooked a
lot of saver kraut in a style only known
to experts. The way the boys ate kraut
tnd weinies wasn't slow because John
let us know that was all we were going
to get. They gave us about seventy
five of the best Parker House rolls ever
manufactured in this village; also some
swell coffee—with the distinct under
standing that we couldn't have any
thing stronger. John suggested that
he would find some dessert and, tho
we felt stuffed, when he brought forth
a large platter of strawberry jello whh
real strawberries and two bowls of
whipped cream, there was no difficulty
in finding extra room. Those present
were:
Clifford Hayes, Carl Andresen. Max
Andresen, Harry Woldenburg, Norman
Nelson, Leonard Wunder, Harold Wol
denberf, John Mclntosh.

County Roads Almost Impassible
How could it be otherwise with
seven feet of snow on a level and a
new fall of snow almost every day.
Since the weather turned warmer the
first of this week the roads have be
come worse. So long as it remained
cold the horses found solid footing but
since it turned warmer they often bog
down and have to be helped to their
feet. Young Mr. Horey came in from
the Hove ranch on the head of the
Churostick yesterday and said he was
almost half day coming the nine miles.
The south side Peshastin road is closed
by heavy slides and the north side road
is all but impassible.
THE GREAT NORTHERN
R. R. STILL TIED UP
Destruction of 400-Foot Bridge Wednes
day Near Scenic Further Delays
Opening of the Road
The taking out of a 400-foot bridge
one mile west of Scenic Hot Springs
Wednesday, about 12 o'clock, by a
monster slide will further delay the
opening of the road to traffic. Numer
ous slides are known to have occurred
yesterday on both sides, of the moun
tains. It is a mere guess when traffic
between Leavenworth and the coast is
reopened. Two trains have crossed
the mountains since Dec. 31st. A
fast mail train crossed the mountains
last Sunday night and the same day a
train of fuel oil came thru from the
west.
Railroad authorities expect to have
the road open inside of a week. Two
rotaries left early this morning with
boarding cars and a large crew, and it
is believed the road from Leavenworth
to the summit of the Cascades will be
opened by evenine. The rumor in
circulation this morning that the Wilson
Creek bridge had washed out, is denied
by the railroad company.

Leap Year —The custom which or
dains that a woman may propose mar
riage to a man in leap year dates back
seven or eight hundred years. An act
of the Scottish parliament, passed about
the year 1228, made it a crime pun
ishable by a fine, for an unattached
man to refuse to become the life part
ner of a woman who had the courage
to "speak ye mon she liked!"
The custom in a milder form is re
ferred to in a work published in 1606,
entitled, "Courtship, Love and Matri
mony."
Albeit it has now become a part of

Council Orders Them Cleaned Out—The
Immense of Snow Puts City to
Much Expense
Last Tuesday evening was the regu
lar meeting night of the city council
but only three members, Featherstone,
Kugelman and Seeley, and Mayor Day
made their appearance. In conse
quence the meeting adjourned to Wed
nesday evening when one more mem
ber braved the storm. The roll call
then showed FeatherstOLe, Kugelman,
Miller and Seeley present and as four
constitutes a quorum they proceeded
to do business. The session was a
long one and there was "heap much
talk" but not much business.
The first matter up was paymeut of
bills. There was a stack, as one mem
ber remarked, as high as the snow and
most of them were caused by the su
perabundance of snow. Since the first
of January 8144.20 has been spent for
snow shoveling. As this must be paid
out of the street and alley fund, and
as that fund has only $593 to its credit,
it leaves very little for street work this
coming summer.
A communication from Mr. Wolden
berg was read which asked that he be
excused from attendance at meetings
until he was sufficiently recovered from
his illness to attend. The communi
cation also urges the council to imme
diately take steps to bring its suit
against Seaman & Quigg.
The bond of Police Judge Graham
was approved.
The mayor appointed a committee
to revise the present license ordinance,
partly to increase the city's revenue
and also to afford some protection to
our home merchants from outside ped
dlers. There will, of course, be an
upward revision.
At the suggestion of council the
mayor gave Chief Potter instructions to
notify all those who have punch boards
that they will have to be taken out.
The city's suit against Seaman &
Quigg was next brought up and dis
cussed at some length. It was the
opinion of most of the members that
Nuzum & Nuzum's terms were too
high and that an effort should be made
to secure the services of an attorney
who would take the case on a contin
gent basis. Something definite will
probably be done at the next meeting.
After several ineffectual attempts a
motion to adjourn was finally carried.

face without, however, injury to his
eyes. Mr. Tvedt says the road to the

Ten Dollars an Ounce for Postage
The first settlement on the present
site of San Francisco dates back from
1776. It consisted of a Spanish
military post (presidio) and the Fran
ciscan mission of San Francisco de
Asis. In 1836 the settlement of
Yerba Buena Vista was established in
a little cove southeast of Telegraph
Hill. The name San Francisco, how
ever, was applied to all three settle
ments. The United States flag was
raised over the town in 1846, and the
population rapidly incieased, reaching
perhaps 900 in 1848. The news of
the gold discoveries was followed by
crowds of fortune seekers, so that by
the end of 1858 the city had an esti
mated population of 20,000. From
that time on San Francisco grew rap
idly. The first regular overland mail
communication with the east was es
tablished by pony express in 1860, the
charge for postage being $5 for half an
ounce. In 1869 the completion of
the Central Pacific railway to Oakland
marked the beginning of transconti
nental railway communication.

Congregational Pastor Resigns
In resigning the pastorate of the
church, Leavenworth loses a valuable

services of a man of ability and real
worth. From a somewhat intimate ac
quaintance with Rev. W. S. Came we
formed a high opinion of his character
as a man and his accomplishments as
an educated and refined gentleman. It
is understood the Corbin Park Congre
gational church of Spokane has under
consideration calling him. That or
any other church will be the gainer in
having his services. Leavenworth is
too small a field for him.
FAST MAIL IN THE DITCH
LAST SUNDAY AT MALAGA
Engine and Three Cars Left Track—En
gineer Dean Seriously Injured-
Switch Left Open
Last Sunday afternoon at 5;30 the
fast mail, following 43, the first train to
be sent thru to the west since the tie
up last Monday night, Jan. 31st, went
into the ditch at Malaga station, twelve
miles east of Wenatchee. The engine
and first three cars went off the track,
the engine turning over on the Side.
Engineer Harry Dean was quite se
verely jcalded, but is not believed to
be seriously hurt. Fireman Hanover
jumped and escaped injury. The cars
that went off the track were loaded
with fast freight, the mail cars remain
ing on the track. The track was
cleared by ten o'clock and an engine
sent from here brought the train to
Leavenworth, arriving by 12 o'clock
and started on its trip thru the canyon.
Harry Dean, one of the oldest en
gineers on the road, well known here
where he lived many years, was badly
scalded by escaping steam. He was
rushed to the Wenatchee hospital, suf
fering intense pain. On Tuesday of
this week he was resting easier and
considered out of danger. Fireman
Hanover jumped thru the cab window
and while considerably bruised, he es
caped injury. Two of the mail clerks
were badly shaken up, but not other
wise injured. The engine ran into
two empty fruit cars standing on the
siding and only left the tracks to show
that cars had been there. The fire
man detected the open switch and
called to Dean, then jumped. Dean
threw on the air brakes but too late to
avoid the wreck.
