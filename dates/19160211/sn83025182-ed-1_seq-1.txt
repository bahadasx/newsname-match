WASHINGTON, Feb. 11.—Major
neral Hugh Scott, chief of staff of
army, today la acting secretary
war, while President Wilson is
up his mind regarding a suc
nsor for Llndley M. Garrison, whose
eignatlon, announced last night,
Commerce, had not decided upon defi
nite action. He had even dictated a
speech which, he tried to make con
form to the president's wishes and
had announced to newspapermen that
advance copies of his speech would
be given out as soon as his stenogra
pher transcribed his notes.
The speech finally was transcribed,
copies were made and Secretary Gar
rison's private secretary had them
ready to give out, but as he was in
the very act of doing BO, another em
ploye in the secretary's office was
called suddenly Into Garrison's private
office. A moment later he dashed
out with, the order that "the speech
must be held up for Anal perusal by
the secretary."
There was a wait of over an hour.
During that time Secretary Garrison
called AMtstant Secretary Breckln-,

an hour Breckinridge went directly
to his own office aud returned a mom
ent later with his overcoat and hat
on. Secretary Gartlson himself ap
peared 1$ the outer corridor with
Breckinridge a moment later and It
was announced that the secretary and
Mrs. Garrison had been suddenly
called out of town.
The secretary earlier In the day had
told of the death of Mra. Joseph
Kuhn, wife of Colonel Kuhn, military
attache of tl»e American embassy In
Berlin, while she was standing in
the receiving line at Mrs. Garrison's
formal Wednesday reception. He had
said he had been terribly affected
and that Mrs. Garrison had been
thrown Into a highly nervous condi
tion because of the tragic event. His
private secretary let the report be
spread that Mrs. Garrison was in a
worse "state than the secretary nad
admitted and that it was necessary to
get her 'as far away from the scene
as possible.
Between the time Garrison an

and the time he announced the speech
would not be delivered, he had writ

ate the two chief objections to the
present militia system, he found In
the Hay bill actually entrenched the
conditions to which he objected.
First of all Garrison favored a plan
whereby officers of state guards
should be under a national board of
officers to teet their efficiency.
Appointment of officers by gover
nors for political favors or their se
lection by men In the ranks, he con
sidered fatal to any plan of military
effectiveness. He put this condition
up to the convention of national guard
officials in San Francisco, but his plan
was turned down. Later he found
Hay had decided to stand by the state
guardsmen and also to pay them. It
Is known that Gtarrlson considered
this whole proposition as unwise
spoils politics.
His second objection to the present
militia is that it la governed from
forty-eight different centers and has
forty-eight different standards of ef
ficiency. He wanted It all directed
from Washington.
Garrison did not propose to elim
inate the national guard or to substi
tute the continental army for it. But
he believed his plan of a volunteer
army of 400,000 controlled from Wash
ington would attract young men who
would not enlist in the militia. He
planned to enlist 133,000 men each
year for a term of three years, and
to retain them under regular officers
near their own homes In summer
camps. They would receive regulars'
pay while on duty. The estimated an
nual cost was 45,000,'000. State
guardsmen believed this plan surely
would encroach upon their preserves.

Retires From Public Uts.
N®W YORK. Feb. 11.—Making his
first statement as to his future plans
since his resignation as secretary of
war, Llndley M. Garrison today de
clared he had retired from politics,
and that he "could not conceive of
his taking the stump against Presi
dent Wilson."
The former secretary received news
per men early this afternoon at the
home of George Leary on Fifth Ave.
He went to the Leary home imme
diately on his arrival here last night
but during the morning all communi
cation with Garrison was denied and
it was first declared he would make
no statement whatever.
"Get It out of your head that there
Is anything political in my action,"
was one of Garrison's first statements
when word was finally sent ou,t that
he would meet the reporters.
"I am going to find some place
where I can pursue my vocation or
avocation, support myself and my
wife, and lay by a little for the fu
ture," he continued.
"I am out of politics. I am not a
candidate for the governorship of
New Jersey and would not accept the
governorship if I were handed a cer
tificate of election."
Asked If he Intended to carry his
opposition to President Wilson's
plans for the army In connection with

We Cannot Protest.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11.— Th«
United States, it was stated on high"
est official authority today, cannot
protest the announced sea policy of
the Teutonic powers to sink armed
merchantmen without warning.
That this government, believing the
Teutonic nations to be within their
rights in this respect, shortly will
issue a warning to all its nationals
not to travel on belligerent ships thai
carry guns of any kind, seemed cer
tain.
This position must be taken, many
officials declared today, if America's
attitude is to continue to be logically
followed out.
The American attitude regard'ng
aiming of merchantmen, it becama
known for the first time today, waa
clearly set forth in the informal aug
gestion it recently made to the en
tente allies concerning the "absence
of conditions now, which in earliel
times was the excuse for arming ol
merchantmen." These reasons wera
presence of privateers and pirates on
the high seas.
None of the powers addressed, Seo
retary Lansing said today, has replied
to these suggestions. He said ha
assumed their delay was caused by
the obvious necessity of joint delib
eration of the question. The English,
however, unofficially have expressed
themselves unalterably opposed to
any suggestion that would put theii
merchantmen at the mercy of the sub
marines. In informal statements, high
officials at tho British embassy hav^
indicated their belief that England
and her allies would never conseni
to this.
