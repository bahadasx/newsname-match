have been in progress for the past
three weeks closed. Sunday morn
ing about twenty-five young and
old persons were admitted to the

Meet After Thirty Years
N. W. Elliott of Oketa, Kansas, i
arrived in this city last week to !
visit his brothers on Big Bear ridge. !
This was the first time the brothe>s '
had met for thirty years. Mr. |
Elliott is a Kansas farmer and j
thinks there is no place like the
good old Sun F.ower stite. He
thinks the hiils of this country are
a little to steep to do much farm
ing, but in talking finally admitted
that it looked good to him at that.
The "Hot Air" merchants adver
tising "Hot Air" for sale had to
take ice the past two weeks.
The Kendrick Auto Company says
"they are so glad the snow is leaving
it looks like they will soon be able
to see a Ford roll over the hill to j
get their brakes relined. !
The editor was talking to a citi- j
zen of this city Monday morning I
about a man living in Lewiston and j
the fellow said the only time he ,
ever believed the Lewiston man, |
was, after he dffi what he said he ,
was going to do.
Where is the dog catcher? It is ■
time he was getting busy with his
dog tags and shot gun.
!
Last week an exchange was howl
ing because some other paper had
stolen his Editorials. That is good,
if that is all they took.
!
The Troy News claims the destine- i
tion of being the only Democrat :
paper in the county. Wonder what
column he puts the Star-Mirror in.

M. L. Koker of Frazer, is in this
city visiting at the home of John

The above is a photograph of the special train of forty-four cars of salmon which was shipped over the Northern Pacific Railway by the
P. E. Harris Company of Seattle a few days ago. The cargo consisted of fifty thousand cases, or one million, nine hundred and twinty thousand
cans, the largest shipment of salmon on record. It was consigned to Eastern markets and for export. The train was handled on fast schedule,
e'-'en-lowering the time agreed upon by the railway company. The demand for canned salmom is increasing each year, hut fortunately our
Pacific coast canneries are able to supply it.

One Hundred Perish
San Diago, Feb. 8 —- More
than one hundred lives have
been lost, as nearly as can he
ascertain, in the valleys near
San Diago as a result of the
most terrible cloudburst and
rain that that section of Cali
fornia has known for years.
Some of the victims lost their
lives when a dam,in the lower
Otay Valley went out. The
damage to property is =aid to
amount to millions of dollars,
h is . expected that the loss
will be still heavier.
Mysterious Airship Reported
Santa Barbara, Cal., Feb. 7.—Os
borne Coffey, a rancher, today re
poited having seen a mysterious air
ship Sunuay night when it flew in

shore. An automobile party report
ed having seen an aircraft late
Sunday, after flying two miles from

Ladies St"dy Club
i
! The Kendrick Study Club met
! Wednesday of this week, at the
' home of Mrs. J. T. Moser. The
| program consisted of a paper on
j "The Yellow Peril" by Mrs. J. E.
Hoyt, which was followed by a song
"The Tango Tokyo" rendered by
Mrs. Jessie Helpman. Mrs. Joday
Long in a very interesting paper,
told of the great influence the Dutch
have had upon the western states.
Mrs. Moser was assisted in enter
taining the ladies of the club by her
little daughters, Gwondolyn and
Lucile, dressed as Chinese maidens,
who sang a pretty song, after which
refreshments were served. This
program closed the study of Cali

Our National Pay-UP Week
February 21 to 26 Is The Week Set Aside For Everybody
to Get Straight With The World.
The idea of a national Pay-Up
Week, to be observed from Febru
ary 21 to February 26, is meeting
with favor? and it is probable that
in all the states a successful cam
paign will be conducted to induce
people to pay their honest debts
some time during those six business
days. The careless way in which
bills are allowed to go unpaid is a
serious loss and continal inconveni
ence to creditors: and there is not
often any justification in the fi
nancial circumstances of the debtor
for the dilatory method he practices
in regard to his monthly accounts.
Pay-Up week would be a bene
ficent institution if it succeeded in
doing nothing more than to make
heads of households realize that
they and their families are in many
cases living beyond their means, in
dulging in luxuries which their pay
envelopes do not warrant. When
the monthly collector is told to
"just leave the bill for the present,"
that bill is too likely never to come
to the surface again until his next j
visit thirty days later. j
The man who takes to Pay-Up j
week in an honest spirit may disco-;
ver that he has been giving his wife
.
hot house flowers for an annive rsary
present at the same time that he
still owes for his kitchen range or
for last winter's wood. He may
find that those carelessly offered
S. P. Railroad Under Water
Marshfield, Ore.. Feb. 7. Ten
miles of Southern Pacific railway
track is under water between Bea
ver Hill Junction and Myrtle Point,
and passengers between Coos Bay,at
and Coquille aFe being transferred
by launch at Coaledo. The water
in the Coquille river is still rising
and is higher than at any time since
1909. Between Arago and Myrtle
Point the tracks are under seven
feet of water.
Brewster Valley is isolated by the
flood and Ten Mile lakes are higher
than ever before. Coos river has
overflowed many dairy ranches.

Depend upon it, your grocer
would rather sell you only potatoes

promptly than to sell you grape I

you a soup bone once a .week than a J

Pay-Up week for all outstanding ;
accounts should commend itself to :
the mind of every honorable man.
If the cash is not at hand, you can
do what other honorable men do,
give a well secured, interest-bear
ing note. The good • faith of a
delinquent customer should be put
to the test during Pay-Up week.
