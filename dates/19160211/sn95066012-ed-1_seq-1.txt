19 Instances wherein it is charged
German submarines have been fired1

BITTER FIGHTING IN TRENCHES
Official Reports Indicate that Neither
Side Has Made Progress in -Its
Underground Warfare.
London, Feb. 11. French cavalry
attacks at Vlmy and in the Sonne
have failed to retake any of the posi
tions captured by the Germans. Paris
reports are tp the effect that no pro
gress has bet!i made in the lighting
during the paut 24 hours.
London, Fell 10. A terrific conflict
Is in progress on the war-toru area
near Neuvllle and Vlmy, in Artois. Ar
tillery are busy here, infantry ' are
making attacks, sappers are active,
and the men In the trenches and un
derground passages are In frequent
conflict, using hand grenades.
Judging from the olllcial reports,
neither French nor Germans have
made any decisive gain In this hotly
contested region. Berlin announces
that the Kaiser's troop3 have carried
a largo trench section northwest of
Vlmy and also regained a crater
close to Neuville. Puris tells of
steady , progress In underground pas
sages west of La Folie, and reports
the repulse of two German attacks
west of Hill 140.
Prom both sides come reports of re
newed 'activity. The German head
quarters report admits the success of
the FtBnch'ln obtaining a foothold in
the Gorman trendies north 'of ' Bee
qulncourt. Minor operations are In progress at
many other points on the western
front.

MYSTERIOUS BURGLAR
-Earl Darling Would Dash Out In
truder's Brains.
Mr. and Mrs. arl Darling, who
have lately moved into their new
bungalow on Weeks street, went
through an ordeal recently which has
become the best' burglar story told
in town in a decade.
Shortly after getting settled in
their new home, about 2 ' o'clock iu
tho morning an alarming smash
seemed to come from their cel
lar. The noise awakened them both
and Mr. Darling Jay In bed devoutly
wishing the gun,, which he uses in
Bottum's store on those who try to
reach their door without settling their
grocery bills, was wlthlu handy reach,
lly all manifestations an Individual
was in their cellar who emphatically
did not belong there. Also, In enter
ing In the dark (he had evldeutly
pushed over something on the collar
stairs.
If ho had not been made suddenly
nervous by the thought of an Intruder
prowling round the place iu the dark,
tho well-known grocery, clerk
would have turned over and . re
sumed his snoring.. But the more he
thought r.f tho crash in the collar tho
mere his hair begau to rise. Finally
he thrust two quaking knees out of
bed, donned his slippers and . bath
robe and being a young man full of
"sand" it was most natural that tho
Implement of chastisement ho should
reach for should be a "dust" mop, to
lay out that "dirty" burglar.
With this murderous weapon he
placed one foot before the other and
eventually reached tho kitchen. All
was quiet in the regions below. There
were no signs of intruders anywhere
in the house and when he switched
on the electric light In the cellar with
his knees bumping together like emp
ty gourds still no signs of anything
out of the way lay In tho regions be
neath. Long and carefully ho searched the
cellar but no windows had been tam
ored with, nor could he find anytlung
hich . seemed tO( have toppled over
nil,made the unearthly racket 5'uz
zltfcd he returned to bed, firmly i con-viik-edithe
noise had been'miije by
theViamier man Jwho live Jusff over
the yay wind frequently tliros the
furniture 'out of the window iu his
sleep. ' , , ' i
The story might end here, but H
does not.
The next' morning :i Mrs.. Darling,
who Is anexcellent housekeeper, be
gan leanln(t the kitchen. Moor and
reached th cellar stairs. Opening
the' obllar' door she was horrified to
find he upper landing and the utalrs
drenched with blood. ;. !.
Wood! . .
'She shut the door feoling much like
a party who suddenly sees forty-seven
thousand ghosts all at once aud
doesn't know which ono to single out
and become frightened at. With the
nocturnal adventure of a few hours
previous still vivid in her mind, she
was firmly convinced some awful
and bloody deed had been perpetrated
in the cellar which her husband had
overlooked in his investigations the
night before.
Before calling in the neighbors she
decided to learn whether tho blood
came up the stairs or led down
them. She found that the blood was
all over , the place, walls and stairs,
even to a shelf over the cellar laud
ing. Xct wishing her husband to be
known as braver than herself, r,he
procured a chair and investigated
that cellarwoy shelf.
Climax!
A large jar of grape-Juice placed on
the shelf had fermented and at two
' o'clock In the morning had exploded
with loud report, drenching the cellar
I way with gore.

Capture, of Uscieczko Threatens
Austrian Positions
FIGHTING ON 0VIN1 K FRONT
Vigorous Attacks on Teutonic Supply
Depots on East Gallcian
Frontier.
Petrograd, Feb. 10. Developments
in the Galician 'campaigni'whlch for a
fortnight ..have been mentioned only
briefly rn the ...offlchU statements,
figure prominently intoday's news.
Considerable importance is attached
to the occupation of Imeieczko. on the
Dniester, near the Buiowlna; frontier,
which now is securi'ly iu Russian
hands.. - J
After successfully , resisting energe
tic .efforts of the Teutonic, forces to
break their lines, the -Russians have
now resumed tho offensive. Their
object is the capture of Czeniowitz,
tho capital of Bukowina, 'which it Is
thought would exert powerful in
fluence on Rumania.
Uscieczko gives tho Russians a new
and important line of communication
and threatens the position of the Aus
trians in the region ' of Czernowitz.
Capture of this town is regarded as a
decided step in tho direction of the
Russian goal..
The unusual accuracy and effective
ness of tho Russian artillery is men
tioned In qll accounts of tho fighting,
which is continuing vigorously on thr
Dvinsk frnt. The German advance
guards, which have been '.ptiue
stubbornly to establish ne 'ions,
have beeh forced back r, 3ly,
while in the act of digging t,rei. "!s,
to their former lines. Notwithstand
ing their persistent efforts tho lino is
approximately the sanio as that held
by them last October.
The Austro-Hungarlan headquarters
reported received here today says:
The Russians are active against the
Austro-lluugarian advance depots In
VolUynia j and on the east Gallcian
frontier. There has been especially
bitter fighting in the district of Aus
trian Infantry Regiment No. 14,
which continued during the whole
night. The i enemy was finally com
pletely chased. At ono especially
strongly contended position 200 dead
Russians were counted. Besides nu
merous men were takmi prisoner.
There has been bitter fighting also
northwest of Tnrnopol. The Russians
again entered the trenches named In
the recent headquarters report, but
were ejected by a counterattack.
On tho Bessarablan frontier our
Croatian territorials drove back the
Russians from a 'well-fortified ad
vanced position to their main position.

At periods m most childrens lives
they fail to relish their meals and refuse

which causes anxiety and worry. '
To compel them to eat is a grave
mistake, because nutrition is impaired.
Healthful exercise in fresh airandsmv

ant is a spoonful of Scott's Emulsion
three times a day to feed the tissues

their blood, aid nutrition and sharpen

CABINET
War Secretary and President Dis
agree Cver National Defence
AT ODDSJCO.QVSa PHILIPPINES
Secretary Apparently Convinced Hit
Continental Army Scheme Was
Not Backed by Administration,
. Washington, Feb. 11. Secretary
Garrison "-resigned yesterday becausa
President Wilson would, not "Irrevo
cably" support ,the continental army ,
plan and because , ha opposed the ad
ministration's program - of setting a v
definite time for Philippine-indepen-dence.
President Wilson accepted the
resignation and has not selected a
successor. .Tho president himself pro
tably will take personal charge of the
administration's national defenBa
plans in Congress. Assistant Secre-
tary Breckenridge also resigned as a :-:
mark of loyalty to his chief, whose-,
views he shared. The president ac
cepted his resignation. Both take f- .
feet immediately. Maj-Gen Scott,
chief of staff of the army, automati
cally becomes secretary of war ad .
interim. It Is known that one of Sec
retary Garrison's principal reasons 1
for his conviction- that only a federal '
continental army instead of a reor
ganized naticnal guard could be the ,
mbin. military dependence of ' the na
tion was his belief that some '; day
the United States may be called upon
to defend the Monroe , doctrine and
in that 'event he. foresaw that the na- '
tional guard might not be V available
for use outside the iCnlted States he- "
fore a declaration of war. Upon the
contention, on the" one hand, that the '
continental army,, or ultimately uni
versal service, was the nation's only
reliance and the position on the other
that no'oiie plan could fce enforced up
on Congress, President Wilson and
his secretary of war parted official
company. ' -
