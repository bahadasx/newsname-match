i i ?..
Where He is Receiving Euthusiastio
Receptions at Some
Large Gatherings.
CHAULKSTON, Feb. 11?Former j
Judge In K. Kobinaon. of Ihe au-i
preinu court of appeals, is getting u|
warm reception in Fayette county, i
according to reports from Fqyottes-j
vllle ami Montgomery, wliero he
made speeches tills week?lit the for
mer place on Tuesday and at the
latter place Thursday?In the interests
of his candidacy for tlio llepublican
nominal Ion for the governorship.
The meeting at Montgomery was
a rousing one, beiug attended by a
large crowd of representative Republicans
of the eastern section of the
county. Among those present were
many representatives or tlie coal industry,
both operators and miners;
and the candidate was assured that
he was looked upon by both shies as
the harmony candidate whose election
to the governorship would mean
everythinglo the peace and prosperity
of all concerned In the mining of
coal.
Reports from Fayettevlllo declare
that the former Jurist has a following
in that Bection of the county that
will count heavily at the polls, and
that his strength is growing with
each suceedlng day.
Dwelling upon the admirable advancement
of West Virginia, Judge
Robinson at both these towns cited >
its increase in educational advantages,
its Hotter laws and the con-i
tinned aspirations of the people for.
the ideal commonwelalth. "We need," j
he said, "In this day, laws llttlng to1
our advanced age, and with these I
enacted, the people naturally evolute.
into standards that uphold and en-1
force them, The higher the type of I
manhood and the aspirations of the I
people the more nearly we arrive ati
tne solution or an tnose various problems
which confront our civic life.
Inspirations of sterling citizenship
will always assure good laws."
"Let nif Impress upon you," he
continued, "the good that comes from
the spirit of community building. It'
is the first spoke in the wheel of common
welfare. With community building
and the practice of brotherhood,
it then becomes easy to weld these
communities into a great stale."
Judge Itobinson then dwelt upon
the association of business and polltics,
and showing that the two wero
naturally related in a land where
the vote of the people was the rule
of the people, said "The stale needs
business more than It needs politics,
but good politics, pure politics and
real statesmanship prosperous business
conditions are promoted,"
It was in the conclusion of his address
that Judge Iioblnson, speaking
with measured words and deep
emphasis, turned the searchlight on
his own position as a caudldate. "My
candidacy," he said, "comes In answer
to an Insistent demand from the
plain and worthy citizens or this
state. No Individual, faction or interest
stands sponsor for my candidacy.
I am my own mun and my
own candidate, r.fy public career
vouches no other assumption. 1 am
not an ox and do not wear u yoke.!
I am happy In that Individual liberty
which is the heritage of every true;
American, and I shall make this campaign
on a plane of statesmanship
becoming the high office of governor.
If I can not be governor without in
any way depreciating mysoii aim violating
the principle of truth and honesty,
or stullir.ving my conscience, I
do not want to be the chief executive.
"My platform as a mere personal
candidate for the nomination Is only
the embodiment of those principled
of truth anil honor which I learned
in a plain farmhouse In the lillls of
this state years ago; my platform as
the nominee of the Republican party
will he that made by the party itself
in convention assembled; my platform
as governor of this Btnte will
be the constitution of West Virginia
nnd the laws made in pursuance
thereof."

Impossible for a district to assume ad- ,

this district, that portion of it can not
be improved. In addition property

this is possible, it is rarely the case
