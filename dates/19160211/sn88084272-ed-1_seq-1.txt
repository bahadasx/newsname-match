The War At a Glance
T
jHE western front is still the
central field of military in
terest. Latest renorts show
no signs of a lessening in the in
fensit of the violent struggle which
has been going on for several days
in the vicinity of Vimy and Neu-
ille, near the Belgian border, while
farther south along the line there
are signs of reawakening activity
on the part of both Germans anil
French.
Artillery Duel In Ilelclutn
In Belgium, according to unof
ficial reports, a notable artillery
battle has been In progress during
the last days near Ypres, but the
opinion appears to preall among
military observers that the Germans
have decided to postpone their pre
dicted offensive until more favor
able weather preiails They are
reported very busy, however, in
strengthening their lines.
Russians Cnptnre Hlllf
In Russia, the artillery plaj on
the Itlga-Dvinsk front is notably
heavy In character, but the infantry
does not appear to have been active.
In Yolhynla the Russians report a
forward movement In the capture
of a hill between the fortresses of
Rovna and Lutsk, but the latest
Austrian reports claim emperor
Nicholas's troops have been held
to their old positions in Galicia and'

A German Communication
Warns Neutrals to Keep
Off Armed Merchantmen.
Berlin. Germany, Feb 10 ia Lon
don. Hng., Feb 11.) James W Gerard,
American ambassador, received an of
ficial copy of the German memoran
dum on the treatment of armed enemy
merchantmen today. He was Informed
that the orders would go Into effect
February 29.
The memorandum is addressed to the
neutral governments and Informs them
that after February 29, armed enemy
merchantmen will be considered as war
vessels and dealt with accordingly.
The complaint is directed against
Great Britain, which is charged with
arming merchant vessels even before
the outbreak rf war. England's allies,
it says, have followed her example and
will receive the same treatment.
The memorandum contends that the
arming of merchantmen is in violation
of International laws. Copies of In
structions given crews for resisting
submarines are referred to In appen
dix form.
Ships Attack Submarines.
The communication adds.
"By this It Is rendered clear that
armed English merchants ships have
official orders treacherouslv to attacn
German submarines everywhere when
they come near them, that Is, to wage
war against them unscrupulously. In
asmuch as England's rules for naval
warfare are taken over by her allies as
a matter of course, it must be consid
ered that proof has also, been adduced
with respect to armed merchant ships
of other states
"Under the circumstances adduced
above, enemy merchant ships which are
armed with guns have no right longer
to be considered as peaceful merchant
ships The German sea forces will,
therefore, after a short period designed
to protect the rights of neutrals, re
ceive an order to treat such ships as
warships.
Neutrals Are Warned.
"The German government informs the
neutral powers or mis maie oi wmra
in order that they can wsrn their sub
jects from further entrusting their
persons or property to armed merchant
ships of the powers at war with the
German empire "
Austria Follows Snme Conrse.
Vienna, Austria. Feb. 11. The Aus-tro-Hungarian
foreign office today Is
sued a memorandum declaring that
armed enemv merchant vessels would
be dealt with as warships. Austria
Hungary follows the steps taken bv
Germanv. The memorandum charges
that the British admiralty in 1913
caused a number of large British liners
to be armei.
BELGIUM DENIES PEACE
PROPOSAL MADE BY FOE
Timlnn. Eng.. Feb. 11. The Belgian

OFFICER ADMITS NEGLECT
"BRITISH FLEET
REfflTJ FIGHT
Even Battered Cruisers,
Lion and Tiger, Show
Little Effect of War.
Somewhere In the North Sea. via lin
den, Eng., Fed 11. Great Britain s first
line offensive fleet, an incomparable
combination of speed and gun power
ready for instant action, was inspected
Thursday by a party of French and
American correspondents and a repre
sentative of tho Associated Press was
permitted to view from the bridge of
a torpedo boa,t the naval unit which is
expected to meet the first shock of
a German attack.
Upon boarding one of the large bat
tleslllns. the visitors were permitted to
inspect the ship.
Mod' Shows I.lttlc l'oumllng.
The party then lunched as guests of
the divisional rear admiral who was
using the cruiser as his flagship, then
were taken on board the cruiser Lion,
which was admiral Beatty's flagship
in the Doggerbank battle. 'With the
exception of a dent in her forward
turret armor and a similar scar Just
above the waterline this show vessel
of the British navy displays little sign
of the terrible hammering she got
when three German battle cruisers con
centrated their fire on' her
Exploded Shell Is Trophy.
Carefully mounted In the compan
lonway is an 11-inch exploded shell
which the Seydlltz hurled through the
Lion's armor below the waterline.
No sign was loft of the 12-inch shell
which blew in the bulkhead of the ad
miral's quarters after going through
the deck, except the casing and cap
occupying the place of honor among
the Lion's trophies.
The engine rooms of the Lion showed
no sign of the ship ever having been
In battle.
.Tiger Looks Like Xm Ship.
A. torpedo boat picked up a portion
of the party from the Lion and the
remainder from the almost equally cele
brated Tiger, which looked like a new
ly commissioned ship, despite the many
times she Is reported to have . bee
sunk.
The oil burning torpedo boat tore
along the impressive line of battle
cruisers in the battle formation In
which they expect to meet the Ger
man fleet.
Beyond the battle cruisers a long
line of light cruisers lost Itself In the
fog. Some of these vessels are veterans
and show signs of the rough patrol
work they are called upon constantly
to do, but many are newly commis
sioned and have yet to wear the scars
of service.
Speed Is Highly Developed.
Any of these light cruisers could
easily overhaul the fastest liner so far
built.
Beyond the light cruisers was a great
flotilla of colliers constantly feeding
the hungry stokeholds of the battle
cruisers, which even at anchor keep
up a full -head of steam.
Scattered about the fleet were sev
eral destroyer squadrons with light
cruiser leaders and with merchant ships
as parents
The personnel of the whole fleet
seemed to be remarkably fit and eager
ly interested In the work desnite the
uncomfortable conditions under which
their patrol work in the North sea is
done.
Two Injured At Football.
The battle cruiser Princess Royal
which was visited by the party, had
only two members of her crew in the
sick bay. Both of these men were
suffering from Injuries caused by foot
ball which is played with great zest
wheneer a field Is available. The of
ficers occasionally get some golf, but
both men and officers must depend
upon their ship board duties for their
chief means of exercise
