Senator Reed Correct
In the United States Senate re
cently in a debate on the Phili
pine bill, some were disposed
to ridicule the attitude of the
administration towards European
belligerents. Senator Jas. A.
Reed took a hand in the discussion
and addressing the President of
the Senate, said in part:
Mr. REED. Mr. President
We hear a good deal about
what the government ought to
do with reference to our foreign
relations with -other countries
than Mexico. Every once in a
while some gentleman gets up
and says, "We ought to enforce
our rights, we ought to preserve
our dignity as a Nation more
thoroughly than we are doing,"
the innuendo being that we ought
to go to war. Yet there is not
a man in this (Juamber who
would vote for a declaration of
war agafost any European power
today.
The truth is, there is a good
deal of cheap politics being played
by gentlemen who sit in the
grand stand and who say, in
effect, that if they were captain
of the team there would be
nothing but wonderful errorless
games, whereas, like most grand
stand critics, the probabilities
are if they were put into the
game they could not catch a ball
as big as a balloon and could not
"field" it home in a week.
I am getting just a little out
of patience with constant carp
ing criticism, upon the one hand,
because we have insisted too
strenuously upon our rights, and,
upon the other hand, because
we have not with fire and aword
enforced our demands. It is a
veryhappy thing for this country
that. the extremists to whom I
am referring have not been con
trolling the destinies of the
Nation. It is a very fortunate
thing that there has been by the
President a constant and deter
mined insistence upon the rights
of the American Republic so
that our rights have not been
surrendered. It is equally for
tunate that a hot-headed, ambi
tious demagogue, willing to
plunge the country into war in
order to further his politicaj for
tunes, has not occupied the White
House. There are a great many
valiant men who are brave when
they have no opportunity to put
their courage to the test of ex
ecution. The peaceful banks of
Oyster Bay are about the safest
place in the world from which to
issue a declaration of war.
I make no invidious comparison
when I call attention to what al
most every boy has observed,
namely, the difference between
the ferocity of a dog securely
chained in his own yard and one
that is at liberty upon the streets
where his challenge of battle can
be accepted.
Mr. FALL. Does the Senator
REED. In a moment I
once owned a fighting dog of
that variety. He was the best
I was able to accumulate. He
never manifested any great de
gree of courage until after he
was accused of stealing chickens
and I had tied him up to save
his worthless life, whereupon my
yellow animal was transformed
into a raging lion. Let a stray
canine pass along the streets,
instantly my warrior would drew
back , malicious , lips, displaying
dangerous, gleaming fangs; his
eyes glared like the headlights
of a locomotive; his red tongue
lapped out for. gore; his hair
stood on end and he filled the air
with roarings and growlings
typically Rooseveltian. But un
chain the brute and tabby cat
might twitch his tail with per
fect , impunity. Indeed, his
natural habitat was under the
porch." ,. j
AN OLD VALENTINE
When slumber first unclouds my brain
And thought is free
And sense, refreshed, renews her reigne,
I think of thee.
When next in prayer to God above
I bende my knee,
Then, when I pray for thoe I love,
I pray for thee.
And when the duties of the day
Demand of me
To rise and journey on life's way
I work for thee
Or if, perchance, I sing some lay,
Whate'er it be,
All thot the idle verses Bay
They say of thee.
For if an eye whose liquid light
Gleams like the sea
They sing, or tresses brown and bright,
They sing of thee.
And if a wearie mood, or sad,
Possessed me,
One thought can all times make me glad
The thought of thee.
And when once more upon my bed.
Full wearily,
In sweet repose I lay my head,
I dream of thee. i
In short, one only wish J. have
To live for thee, j
Or gladly if one pang 'twould save,
I'd die for thee.

Judge LammlOpposed
One Jones, alleged leader of
the anti-saloon forces in the
state, says: "we are out of the
trenches and on the firing line
ready to oppose Judge Lamm's
candidacy forgovernor." Jones
says the league has enough votes
to defeat any candidate, and of
course, per contra, enough to
elect any man. If so, and Jones
is "it" he will be much sought
after and very powerful in
politics.
In addition to being a high
class lawyer, Judge Lamm is a
republican of the first water,
and since the republicans first
began to flirt with prohibitionists,
"sick 'em, Jones."
Another Demand .
England asks that the ship
Appam, prize of a German scout
ship be returned to its owners.
The Appam is in harbor at Nor
folk, Va., and under all former
rules, should remain there in
terned until the war U over or
takes to its heels or keels and
scoots for whatever port it de
sires, but the injunction to the
United States from England is,
that no recruits shall.be, allowed
to go abroad, no provisions or
anything else which would serve
as equipment for further sea ser
vice against the Allies, failing to
observe which England will held
this country responsible for any
thing which the Appam may do.
At this time there is a crew of
only 22 and that number is said
to be entirely too small to sail so
large.a ship, and hence England
thinks that an effort may be
made to get more seamen and
arms and other equipment and
put out to sea on the trail of
more English merchantmen.
Many poor henpecked hubbvs
square old scores occasionally by
declaring in the presence of their
wives that "the man who isn't
'run' by his wife part of the
time amounts to nothing."

Be Good at Something
Editor B. P. Walker of the
Osborna County Farmer, a Kan
sas paper says:
"You will always have money
in the bank and credit at the
stores i you are the best in your
line. It makes no difference
whether you are working on the
section, digging in the ditch,
shoveling coal, shucking corn,
mowing weeds or shoveling
snow. If you are the most com
petent in town you will get the
most work. The day will come
when you will be boss and
from boss you will step to a man
who hires such work done. This
is the story over and over. The
fellows who didn't believe are
the fellows who are still soldier
ing in the ditch and in the field.
They will stick there because
they are not the best The fel
low who makes his work the best
in the field is the fellow who
gets the promotion. Rising in
the world is the easiest thing on
earth. But you must have the
goods. The black bass com
mands a bigger price on the
market than does the mud tur le.
You can be a mud turtle or you
can be a black bass. But you
can't be a black bass if you stick
to the habits of the mud turtle.
If you have the habits of the
black bass it will be impossible
for you to be a mud turtle. The
black bass succeeds and the mud
turtle fails."
Not every man who takes to
his heels is a coward. The mule
heels should enter into calcula
tion. "Of all excuses this it most for
bid; I did the thing because the
others did."
As the "tater has never been
improved on for keeping oil from
sloshing thru the snout of a can.
so has the evangelist never been
exceeded as a stopper of the
flow of cash into the pocket of
th local preacher. , , "' '
