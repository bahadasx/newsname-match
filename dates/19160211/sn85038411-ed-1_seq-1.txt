President are disclosed in lengthy cor
respondence made public between
' hem.
While Secretary Lane and Henry M.
Pindell, a Peoria editor, were being
onsidered in official circles as likely |
•lioices, it was understood that the
President has under consideration the
names of two or three other men. and
will not make an appointment before
weighing their qualifications carefully.
Democrat for Place
The President has already made up
bis mind to appoint a Democrat to the
place. It was said in well-informed
circles that he will not be from New
Jersey, nor from the South.
Ex-Governor Walsh, of Massachu
setts. Secretary Houston, ex-Governor
Harmon, of Ohio. ex-Mayor Baker, of
• "lev-eland, were added to the names
being discussed. Ex-Governor Adams,

by the President has not been men- I
tioned publicly for the position of Sec- ,
retary of War.

r-hant "hair for the first time since Mr.
Bryan's resignation. The departure of
Mr. Garrison with its possible effects

paredness program was discussed thor
oughly.
Reports that there might be other
resignations from the Cabinet were
met with genera! denials.
Methods Differed
Supporters of the President declared
that lie and Mr. Garrison agreed on
the underlying principles of both the
military and Philippines questions, but

Germany and Austria Issue
Memorandums to Neutral
Governments
Special to the Telegraph
I Berlin, Feb. 11.—The German and
Austro-Hungarian governments have
issued a memorandum to neutral gov
ernments announcing that after March
1 armed merchantmen belonging to
countries at war witli Germany will be
j considered and treated as warships. |
Dr. Alfred Zimmerman, under sec- '
retary of foreign affairs, said:
"We believe we can meet Secretary i
I«insing's ideas concerning submarine '
war.
He referred to the joint note on such i
warfare recently sent by the United
States to all the belligerents.
It is explained in the memorandum |
that Germany takes this step in view '
of what shf cites as secret instructions
of the British admiralty to merchant I
ships to open lire on submarines at !
sight. Germany further cites nineteen
instances wherein it is charged Ger- '
man submarines have been tired upon ■
by merchantmen. The text of the |
memorandum concludes:
"Under the enumerated eircum- I
stances, enemy merchantmen armed 1
with guns no longer have the right to i
be regarded as peaceful merchantmen. !
The German sea forces therefore will
be ordered to treat such vessels as i
warships after a short interval granted I
in the interest of neutrals. The Ger
man government makes neutral pow
ers aware of this situation that they
may warn their citizens against fur
ther entrusting their persons or prop
erty to armed merchantmen belonging
to powers at war with the German
empire."
Find Instructions
The government's action, it is stated 1
follows the finding of the British in
structions on board the British ship
Wood field.
Attached to the memorandum are
several appendices. The first is the
declaration in the house of commons
on March 26, 191?., of Winston Spencer
Churchill, then first lord of the British
admiralty. The second refers to the 1
communication of Sir Cecil Spring- i
Rice, British ambassador at Washing- 1
ton. to William J. Bryan, then Secre- '
tary of State, on August 25, 1914, as i I
appearing ;n the diplomatic corre- i

STATE RESTS IN
FIGHT TO SEND
SHUMAN TO CHAIR
Medical Experts Say "Pneumo-
Thorax Acutctissiums"
Caused Death
I
, AIR ESCAPED FROM LUNGS
Collapse of Organ Result of
, Blow—Father Begins
' I lis Defense
Pneumo-thorax acutetissimus —the
llllering of air front a rent in the
lungs into the pleural cavity—was the
direct cause of the death of Margaret
t E. Shunian.
That opinion was vouchsafed this
morning by Dr. J. Harvey Miller,
medical expert for the Commonwealth,
f shortly before the State closed its
prosecution against William Harvey
• Shunian, ex-police chauffeur for the
murder of his daughter.
, The defense opened this afternoon
after an effort had been made by the
I Commonwealth to amend its indict
ment by changing the time ' upon
which the kicks and blows, alleged to
have caused the girl's death, had been
inflicted.
District Attorney Michael E. St roup
, indicated in his examination of Dr.
R. L. Perkins and Dr. Miller and
Mrs. Sallie J. Bankes that, a change
i might be suggested as to the time
, the wounds were inflicted. Pointed
queries as to the appearance of the
girl shortly before her death and as
to the marks on various parts of the
body as disclosed by the autopsy led
i to this belief.
Plan of Defense
That the defense will endeavor to
show that the girl died—-not as a re
: suit of blows intiieted by her father
but from the effects of a diphtheric
, condition of the lungs, weakened by
• alcoholism was indicated by counsel
for defense in cross-examination.
The photographs showing the bruised
i and battered body of Margaret Shunian
. following the autopsy was finally got.
before I lie jury to-day by District
[ Attorney Stroup. The court ruled this
i evidence out yesterday but Judge
. : Kunkel permitted it this morning to
l help the jurors and court to under
' stand the physicians' descriptions of
, the wounds.
i Throughout the exhibition of the
I photographs Shunian listened intently
j with his elbows on the counsel table,
his head bowed in his cupped hands,
j Mrs. Shuman. clad In deep mourning,
didn't raise her heavy veil throughout
the morning session as she sat by his
I side.
The Emotions of tltc Jury
! Because the low forbids the exhi
i bition of anything lo the jury that
j might tend to sway the emotions or
| otherwise preclude a careful and un-
J biased consideration of the testimony
' only. President Judge Kunkel yester
[ day afternoon refused to permit Dis
' trict Attorney Stroup to introduce pho-
I tographs of pretty Margaret Shunian
' as she lay in bed.
! The pictures were taken of the girl
l as she lay on the hospital cot and
( were snapped in such a way as to show
' plainly the ugly wounds. The one in
i jury on her chest, which, according to
t physicians yesterday, caused a collapse
• of the lungs, showed plainly as a
t furious red bloteli against the clear
i whiteness of her skin.
II To Illustrate the Story
District Attorney Stroup meant to
•: show the pictures us an aid to the
• jury, but after a hitter legal struggle
between the Commonwealth and the
defense the court upheld the defense.
Accordingly Ihe story of the injuries
'to the girl hail to be recounted in
! detail by tbe physicians. Drs. R. T,.
I Perkins and H. It. Weiner were the
i physicians and they took the stand
■ during the late afternoon. Both went
. into detail as to the probable causes of
[ the girl's death on September 4. They
attributed it to injuries caused pre
[ sumably by the kicks and blows of her
' j father on August 27. And it is because
j of the girl's death that Shuman is now
j I fighting bitterly in the shadow of the
| electric chair.
• | In addition to the physicians. Colonel
| Joseph B. Hutchison, ex-chief of po
[! lice, and Coroner Eckinger were
among the witnesses on the stand yes
; terday for the State.
The Defense Opens
The closing of the Commonwealth's
testimony, the introduction of the
I I photographs of the dead girl as she
lay stretched upon her lied in readi-
I ness for the autopsy, the sudden
: switch in the time upon which the
I fatal wounds were alleged to have
been committed, and the opening of
the defense—these were the high
-1 lights of the third day of the trial.
Shuman actually began his battle
to save himself from paying the law's
( penalty for the highest crime against
i the State, with the opening of the
afternoon session. Whether or not he
I would be called lo the stand in his
| own defense neither Arthur 11. Hull
I nor Phillip S. Moyer, of counsel for
I the defense, would say.
Wife by Shuntan's Side
' The accused man to-day showed the 1
! evidences of the severe strain under
which he is waiting, more noticeably
perhaps, than ever before.
Just as she has always done since '
the trial began the little mourning
clad. heavily veiled wife of the ac
cused man this morning stepped
quietly from her seat way back among
■ the spectators in the courtroom and
■ took her place by Shuman's side at
the counsel table.
The belief among lawyers Is that:
the State will obtain a verdict of "sec- !
j ond degree." The penalty for murder
! in the second degree is from five to
| twenty years In the penitentiary.
Physicians Testify
Both Drs. Miller and R. I<. Perkins
, who conducted the autopsy testified
j a sto the condition of the dead girl's

In Belgium, according to unofficial
