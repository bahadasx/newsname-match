unteers, Gees Over Without Action.
Senate Urges Designation of Day
For Collection of Contributions For
Relief of Distressed Armenians.

lions of f 10 a month and places on a

General Sherwood renounced hi3
claim to a pension.
Another pension bill, designed to
benefit widows of Spanish volunteers
who Berved more than ninety days
aroused much discussion, and finally
went over until next Wednesday with
out action. It would grant widows
whose incomes do not exceed $250 a
year pensions of $12 a month, and $3
additional for each minor child, with
out regard to the causes of the sol
dier's death.
Republican Leader Mann urged the
passage of the bill to encourage volun
teer duty. "Especially at present, with
the possibility of war facing us," ho
caid, "it is appropriate that we should
say particularly to the young man,
'You offer ua your lives when you ea
11st, and, by the eternal, if you din
we will take care of your widows.' "
Representative Gardner insisted
that the measure was unfair to the
widows of regular army soldiers.

lng the president to set apart a day

sionary, who had escaped from Uru
mlah, in Turkish Persia, when threat
ened by the Kurds, told of the death
of a Dr. Shimmum, declared to be an
American missionary. The dispatch

portunity for "military caste" in this
country was uncovered in the house
naval nffalrs committee while Rear
Admiral Victor Blue, chief of the bu
reau of navigation, was explaining the
naval reserve proposals of the depart
ment. Admiral Blue stated that tho
navy would like to see a plan where
by an enlisted man who had served
sixteen years either actively or in the
reserve, should have preference In ob
taining government jobs under the
civil service. He recommended a sys
tem such as now gives first choice to
civil war and Spanish war veterans.
"That will never Jo in this coun
try," Interrupted Repiesentatlve Con
nelly of Kansas. "People will never
sland for giving preferenco to men
Who have never been to the front.
They will never stand for mere ser
vice ns a reason for preference."
"I don't liko this hero idea of mili
tary caste," added Representative Cal
laway of Texas "It gets countrle3
Into war unnecessarily."
Admiral Blue said the present re
serve law is not a success.
