LEHARDY AND DAVIS
CLASHJCOLLOQUY
And Turn Charter Mass
i Meeting into a Screem
ing Farce.
The mass meeting called to discuss
the proposed new Palatka charter,
and held at the board of trade rooms
on Monday night, will go down in
the history of the municipality as
one of the most enjoyable exclusive
ly male social functions of this generation.
The meeting started right. The
secretary was on motion requested to
read the charter, but when he ar
rived at 'steenthly, his vocal chords
became fuzzy and, he had turn the
document over to the chairman; v
the audience saw that the chairman
was also getting weak in tones and
his vocal chords needed lubrication,
they took pity and ordered that the
reading of the last 20 columns of the
charter be dispensed with, recom
mending instead that individuals in
the audience take the charter home
and read it on the installment plan.
It was then suggested that Mr. H.
O. Hamm, president of the charter
board, give a brief resume of the
charter's provisions. This Mr. Hamm
said he thought would be unnecessary
as most of the people present had
probably read the charter. He did,
however, explain the work of the
board, told how it had worked faith
fully and conscientiously and had per.
formed its best service without hope
of reward. If there were any pre visions
in the charter not fully un
derstood, he would be glad to explain
them if called to his attention. Mr.
Hanlm made a good impression, and
those, in the audience who heard him
are sure that no matter what the fate
of the charter, he has performed the
part of a patriotic Palatkan, giving
freely of his time and talent for what
he conscientiously believed would be
for the city's betterment.
J. H. Yelverton, Jr., also a mem
ber of the charter board, spoke of
the work of the board and his pur
pose to give the city a fundamental
law which, while differing from those
of many cities in the state, would
prove an advantage to the city of Pa
latka. Mr. Yelverton called atten
tion to several objections which had
been raised to the charter and ex
plaine3 them. He did not claim that
the board had tendered the people a
perfect document, but he did insist
that it was one that was a long way
ahead of our present unsatisfactory
jumble, one whose faults could easily
be remedied later.
Both Messrs. Hamm and Yelverton
made good impressions, and their
words carried weight.
There was a pause in the proceed
ings. Col. C. A. LeHardy slowly uncoiled.
He reached his feet and twisted
his gaze until it had penetrated al!
sections of the audience and finally
became glued to the chairman.
In his hand he held a copy of the
Postem Serial left over from a late
breakfast.
M-i-s-t-e-r Chair-m-a-n , he said,
this is a wonderful document; it is
one of the most wonderful documents
ever evolved from the mind of man.
If I could only get a clearly printed
copy, something that could be read,
I would send it to Washington and
have it placed in the national museum
of municipal documents. It is a lu
lu. It places the management of this
city in the hands of our "best citi
zens" men who can slap their chest
protectors and say "now we have you
plebes on the hips right where the
hair is short, and we will run this
town to suit ourselves." The initia
tive and referendum and recall have
been left out of this charter, and if
we adopt it the commissioners will
have us just where they want us.
0, they are some peaches, all right.
Mr. LeHardy talked in this strain fot
some 20 minutes and he was sarcas
tic, vindictive, smilingly so, every
second of the time. He had the
house in an uproar of laughter all the
time he was speaking. And let us
tell you it was some speech. It .was
LeHardvesaue to the core, and yet. an
appeal for real democracy as opposed
to autocracy..
The Honorable Howell Davis sat
hut a little distance from LeHardy
and his blood went bubbling toward
his head, making him angry.
He also arose deliberately, lootcea
the chairman in the eye and pointed
his index finger at that gentleman
just like a statesman on the half
shell does when he buys his first long
tailed coat with the purpoifa of break
ing into congress.
Mr. Davis was impressive. He
started in to use his peculiar nasal
twang, but as he warmed up forgot
to use.it, thus loosing much of his
power as a , platform debater. He
said that the charter board did not
place a recall plank in the proposed
charter; had they intended to do so
they would have elected a socialist
on the board.
Excuse us please: we could not do
that address justice, and neither could
we do the address of Mr. LeHardy
justice. They alternated made two
speeches each, ana in tne course oi
delivery each looked the other in the
eye. Davis was mad clear through;
LeHardy was provokingly good na-tured.
In Davis' last speech he told or
his knowledge of municipal matters;
he was an expert and he didnt ap
pear to care who knew it. "I have
given many years to the business of
the city," said he, "and there is no
man who kpows as much sbout the
business of managing a city as my-
EXECUTIVE
That the Obnoxious Resolu
', tions Should be Rescinded.
Pursuant to a call issued by Chair
man Julian C. Calhoun, the Putnam
county democratic executive commit
tee met at the court house ,at 11
o'clock on Wednesday. There were
some 20 members of the committee
present.
Chairman Calhoun told the commit
tee of the action of the Palatka mas3
meeting of democrats on Tuesday
night, and recommended that the
committee take some action on the
matter of the resolutions passed at
the recent meeting of the State Com
mittee. A committee consisting of W. M.
Williams, W. A. Russell and L. M.
Baldwin was appointed to prepare
resolutions for the committee. This
committee withdrew , and in a few
minutes reported the following:
Resolved that it is the sense of the
Putnam county democratic committee
that the Chairman of the State Com
mittee should immediately reconvene
his committee for the purpose of re
scinding sections 4 and 5 of the reso
lutions adopted at the January meet
ing and that Col. P. J. Becks, member
ot tne btate Uommittee from this
county be requested to attend the
reconvened meeting of the committee
and use his utmost endeavor for the
repeal of the obnoxious resolutions.
The resolutions were adopted with
but one dissenting vote, that of Mr. D.
J. Coughlin.
The committee decided to assess
candidates for county offices one-
half of one per cent, of their first
year's salary to defray the expenses
of the campaign.
Chairman Calhoun, who is to be a
candidate for county judge, tendered
his resignation, which was reluctant
ly accepted. The resignation of P.
M. Hagan who is a candidate for
sheriff was also tendered and ac
cepted for the same reason.
J. H. Haughton and Chas. Burt of
this city were elected chairman and
secretary of the county committee
respectfvely, for the ensuing two
years.
t Presbyterian Church.
Rev. William Gaston, D. D., LL. D.
formerly, of Cleveland, Ohio, but now
pastor or the San Mateo church will
exchange pulpits with Rev. C. M. Al
ford, D. D., pastor of the Palatka
Presbyterian church, next Sunday at
the morning service. In the evening
Dr. Alford will preach, using as his
theme, "There Wrested A man With
Him." Sunday school meets at 9:45
a. m. and midweek prayer service at
7:30 o'clock, Wednesday evening. A
cordial invitation to all.
The County Commissioners.
The February meeting of the board
of county commissioners had little at
its meeting beside routine work, of
which there was the usual large
amount. The board completed its la
bors early on Wednesday. It had
been the purpose to re-district the
county, but this was found to be im
possible except by a petition of
voters, to the number of two-thirds.
Several applicants were made for
admission to the poor farm and sev
eral were admitted.
Correction.
The Woman's Club begs to correct
the statement made in last week's
issue of The News that they would
hold a public reception at the Putnam
House on Friday afternoon, Feb. 11th.
for Mrs. W. J. Bryan.
ihe reception is for club members
only, as the club is not in a position
to entertain the number that would
be present at a general reception.
However, any club member may in
vite a guest to attend the meeting
and report to treasurer with the usual
fee and this will entitle them to re
main for the reception.
The Reciprocity Dance.
Wednesday evening the young men
of the town gave a delightful "re
turn" dance in the Putnam House to
thirty-one couples in compliment to
the young ladies who gave the charm
ing New Year, or Leap Year dance.
The banquet which was served at
nine o'clock was most delicious, the
tables being decorated with red car
nations and greens.
The menu included oyster cocktails,
turkey, mashed potatoes, creamed
peas, olives, celery, a salad course,
strawberry ice cream, .cake and cof
fee. The programs were dstributed at
the tables and dancing began at elev
en o'clock. There were 23 dances and
six extras.
The grand march was led by Mjss
Winnifred Haughton and James Wil
kinson, Miss Helen Cochrane and Geo.
Selden. Beautiful costumes were worn
by the ladies and it was a charming
picture to the onlookers. The young
men proved their ability to recipro
cate in the best style.
self, except one, and he is dead."
Then came Mr. LeHardy's turn and
he again turned loose his flood of
loose-jomted sarcasm and in a way
to plug up the holes Davis had made.
It was getting late however and the
people began to desert the hall, and
before LeHardy got through the hour
had arrived when honest married men
who desire peace in the family knew
they must get home and they got.

trict, W. R. O'Neal, Orlando.
The above is the result of the Re
publican State Convention at the
Howell Theater in this city on Wed
nesday. But it wasn't all; there were some
resolutions passed which stab at the
very vitals of the present democratic
administration, located both in Wash
ington, District of Columbia, and Tal
lahassee, Florida. They left a gap
ing, bleeding wound, but one that doc
tors of democracy tell us is not ne
cessarily fatal.
The convention was inclined to
nominate Geo. E. Gay of this city
for governor, but Mr. Gay said them
nay; he is too busy.
The balance of the State ticket is
to be made by the State Executive
Committee, and it is more than likely
that Mr. Gay will be named for one
of the leading places, either secre
tary of state, or state treasurer.
These do not carry with them all the
honor that attaches to a nomination
for governor, and neither is there so
much demand for lubricants.
Chairman Chubb of the State Ex
ecutive Committee called the meeting
to order, and in doing so made what
might be termed the ex-officio proc
lamation of the day. Mr. Chubb is
a thriller; he is a politician of high
order and upon whom the mantle of
some political prophet has fallen
name not given. He is the boss of his
partv in Florida, and he rules with
dignity and firmness. What he says
goes.
Jos. E. Lee (colored) of Jackson
ville was made temporary chairman.
and John Stoker and H. M. Bradley,
a nother nigger made secretaries. Lee
read the call to arms.
You must hand it to Joe Lee he is
a crack-a-jack chairman. While the
committeee on credentials was out.
speeches were made by "Judge" Go
ber of Ocala, W. R. O'Neal, and r
few others. Possibly the best speech
of the day at least the one to which
most interest attached was made by
a negro named Blodgett from Jack
sonville. He advised his Afro-American
fellow citizens to pocket any po
litical aspirations they may entertai
and turn them over, pockets and all,
to their posterity. He was a warm
number.
"Judge" Gober, who hails from
Ocala, and boasts a long line of dem
ocratic ancestors who are too dead t"
blush for their offspring, made a hit
He was only recently converted to re
publicanism, but the work of regen
eration was evidently thorough. . V'
told of how he had been brought into
the light; how that "once he was
blind, now he could see," and all men
looked alike to him. He had oblit
erated the color line which had for
merly confined this uniform resem
blance to niggers. The "Judge"
didn't say what he had up his sleeves,
but it is evidently some good federal
office which has been promised him
after this period of "Watchful Wait
ing" is passed and republicans are
again invited to sit at the table. Ma
rion county democrats have been de
nying "Judge" Gober a place at the
table; he has fain filled his belly with
husk lunches; these, however, appear
to have agreed with him. He had ?
look of physical culture, well-groomed.
But he had a soul-longing thai
could never be satisfied short of offi
cial pie. He hopes for a hand-out.
Most of the white men who attend
ed the convention from distant parts
of the state had been postmasters and
sich like things under the pre-Wilson
regime. They would return to offi
cial life, to which long service has
given them a special fitness, so t
speak. Earning a living in the sweat
of one's brow is not to their likeing.
If you should ask them why they
are so patriotic in their devotion to
their country and the flag, they would
tell you that it was because of their
devotion to protection and the party
of Lincoln. Also the uplift of the
negro.
Negto delegates were jgreatly in the
majority. They were most all ff'
wore canes and long-tailed coats and
smoked seegars. They had every
outer appearance of that political
ponderancy which goes to make np
the trade marks of statesmanship.
They looked some different from 'del
egates to an A. M. E. Confenence
the only similarity being the complex

"IHE EUROPEAN WAR
-ITS LESSON TO US"
Will be Theme of William
Jennings Bryan's Ad
dress To-night.
William Jennings Bryan, without
doubt the greatest orator on the Am
erican platform, is to deliver an ad
dress in the Howell Theater tonight
under the auspices of the Palatka Wo
man's Club.
There is something in the addresses
of Mr. Bryan that place him in a
class by himself as a Chautauqua
course lecturer. Boiled down, this
difference consists in the fact that
he is a man with a message. His ad
dresses are a inspiration to right
living and right action.
There is no man in public life in
this country so feared by the enemies
of the common people as Mr. Bryan.
For this reason there is no man in
public life who has been so greatly
misrepresented and maligned by the
partizan press. Independent of the
fact that he has been on three sep
arate occasions the candidate of the
democratic party for president of the
United States, independent of the
fact that it was his influence in the
Baltimore convention four years ago
that brought about the nomination
of President Wilson, and that he was
for more than two years Secretary
of State the American premier
Mr. Bryan will go down in history
as the greatest force of his genera
tion in American politics. His real
power springs from the fact that he
is everywhere recognized as the great
commoner. No citizen of. the repub
lic, even in a diplomatic capacity, ev
er received greater honors abroad
than Mr. Bryan, who was received
by monarchs and parliaments as a
private citizen of the United States,
a man who stood only as the repre
sentative of the great common peo
ple of his country.
This is the man Palatka will have
the privilege of hearing tonight. The
theater will be packed.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan with their
grandson will arrive in Palatka this
morning over the Florida East Coast
Railroad from their winter home in
Miami. About noon todsy Tom Rus
sell will take Mr. Bryan in his Max
well motor car to Crescent City,
where he will deliver an address in
the Auditorium at 3 o'clock. During
his stay of a few hours in Crescent
City Mr. Bryan will be entertained
at a luncheon given in his honor by
Miss Bessie A. Williams, president of
the Village Improvement Association.
He will return to Palatka in the same
motor that carried him to Crescent
City. On Saturday morning Mr. and
Mrs. Bryan will take the Ocklawaha
river trip and will spend Sunday in
Ocala.
