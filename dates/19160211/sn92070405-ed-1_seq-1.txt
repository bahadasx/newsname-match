BIG FIGHT SATURDAY
NIGHT GOES TO DRAW
In the best, pugilistic contest yet
staged in Lordsburg Al Salazar of
the Phillipines and Jack Lopez of
Santa Rita fought ten fast rounds
to a draw. Both boys were in ex
cellent condition and at all times
alert for the fatal blow. They eyed
each other constantly and few wild
blows ever got across. During the
first three rounds young Lopez had
the best of his opponent but the
last seven rounds belong'to Sala
zar. On actual count Salazar out
pointed the Santa Rita scrapper
but the decision of the referee in
calling it a draw was most satif
factory. Both fighters drew blood
early in the game- ep.c.h putting one
to the right eye simultaneously.
Lopez is a classy little boxer and
showed the skill of an old timer.
Sal delivered the goods in his usual
manner, using his science to ad
vantage. Kid Smith of the Liberal office
fought Kid Mack of Oklahoma City
a six round mill in which the for
mer was awarded the decision
Smith is coming out remarkably
and showing all the ear-marks of
a go-getier. He gave Mack a hard
run, but retarded a severe punish
ment or a knockout owing to the
boy's light weight. Smith has
challenged either Salazar or Lopez
for a ten round go and is receiv
ing hearty support.
There was a good crowd at the
fight and Promoter Mullarkey
made a good cleaning. There was
some betting, but not enough to
give one heart failure. The crowd
behaved well and a large number
of ladies saw the battles through.

W. E. Barnes Here Saturday
Like the old, old Sunday School
song:' "Scattering Smiles and
Sunshine" are tne trips of W. E.
Barnes, traveling freight and
passenger agent of the Southern
Pacific, one of which took place
Saturday when Mr. Barnes was
i i j. j.1
nere siraigntening out me
wrinkles collected during the
congested traffic while the big
flood in the Colorado river was
on creating havoc at Yuma and
the S. P. lines in and about that
city.
Mr. Barnes has begun a cam
paign of publicity, creating wide
sentiment in favor of flood pre
vention at Yuma. "It is plainly
the duty of the government to
safeguard the interests of this
important section of the country
by the proper control of the lower
Colorado and Gila said Mr.
Barnes. He ha3 set out to see
this accomplished, as he has
many other important things for
the Southwest.
While here Mr. Barnes secured
data of mines, cattle, farming
and town progress together with
cuts, for publication in news
papers, magazines and literature
pertaining to the advancement
of the Southwest. This material
will be prepared for publication
at an early date and it is certain
that Lordsburg will participate
in the good effects of such
publicity.
REDROCK
Two important real estate sales
were made this week, J. M.
Wright buying the 80-acre farm
of Roy Harper, taking possession
immediately, and Roy Harper
buying the farm of his mother,
Mrs. S. C. Harper, who with her
two younger children, J? rank and
John, will leave at once for Dem
ing, to make their future home.
' Mr and Mrs. F. R. Coon, Mr.
and Mrs. Walker of Lordsburg,
motored to the river last Sunday
for an outing. All went well till
they started home, when the
machine "bowed up" and all the
mild words and soft answers
failed to move the brute till late
in the afternoon Monday. The
members of the party were guests
at the Red Rock farm during
their enforced stay on the Gila.
The Clifton Game
In what was termed by all who
saw It, the best game of basket
ball ever played in Clifton, the
lordsburg Girls' Basket Ball
Team lost to the Arizona Sextette.
The local girls were clearly eclip
sed in size and weight by the
oppossingteam, but they made up
for this with speed and passing.
It was also the Lordsburgs girls'
initial appearance on an inside
court, so this with the bright
lights and the deafening cheering
was slightly against them.
One of the regular forwards-
having moved away the last week
there was no practiced player to
support the remaining forward.
To this we owe our defeat, if any
one reason can be given.
The guards Ruth Chase and
Inez Clay, after the first five
minutes, played an exceptionally
fine game, getting the ball back
to their fowards with swift pass
es. The girls, especially Ruth
Chase were against forwards
much larger and older than them
selves. The Clifton forwards
were Lydia Beck and Mildred
Cottey, both being very apt at
putting the ball in the basket,
Miss Beck wa3 very proficient at
shooting for goals.
In the center field, excellent
work was done by both sides,
especially rotable being the work
of the jumping centers, Dorothy
Citase, and Mildred Wise. The
side centers were Emma Reisden
for Clifton and Catherine Bailey
for Lordsburg. Miss Chase did
her usual fine playing. Miss
Wise easily shone as a star play
er, being, swift, clean and
accurate.
The work of Julia Beam, as
forward, was nothing less, than
spectacular, she was over the field
and back in a second. Her as
istants Dewey McGrath, substi
tuted by Mildred Tumble, were
well guarded by Lucile Merril.
Miss Beam, who took all of the
nineteen points, was guarded by
Margaret Cotty, who was the
superior in weight of her op
ponent by over fifty pounds.
This guard was, later, taken out
for roughness and Miss Reisden
put in her place.
The courtesy and kindness of
the Clifton people to our team is
to be commended. They rooted
and chéered for Lordsburg, as
well as for Clifton. Every girl
on the team was royally enter
tained, by members of the Clifton
team.
On Saturday, morning Feb
ruary 19, the Clifton team comes
down here to fight for the
championship over Lordsburg.
This will be the third and decid
ing game. The points at present
are 58 to 31 in favor of Lords
burg. Be sure and see that game.

Body of Prospector Found
The last of the clouds surround
ing the mysterious disappearance
of two of . Lordsburg's prospect-
orsand "good-fellows".have been
lifted upon the finding of the
body of A. W. Vanllouten,
pioneer of the Southwest, high
on the summit of Richolite moun
tain north of Red Rock on the
Gila River. A few weeks ago
the body of James Sterling, pros
pector, was found in Hodoo Canon
at Gold Hill, and now the record
of missing scouts and miners is
complete.
A. W. Vanllouten came to the
Richolite District near Red Rock
about a year ago and together
with F. W. Brakefield, located
some good looking copper claims
north of the Gila River. He is
said to have come from Magda
lena and Kelly, N. M. later drift
ing down to Socorro thence to El
Paso and Red Rock. In Novem
ber he made a sale of some of his
holdings in El Paso and with the
initial payment began a "celebra
tion" from which he never fully
recovered.
' On December 8th he left the
camp of his partner, Felix Brake
field, to go to the Red Rock post
office to buy postage stamps.
Prior to leaving he talked to his
"pard" of quitting liquor for
good at the time having appar
itions of forms moving about the
mountains. From the time of
leaving the door of his shack
nothing more was heard of him
until Sunday afternoon when his
body was found by F. M. Chap
man who was on a prospecting
trip near the summit of Richolite
Peak; one of the highest on the
Gila river. Cowboys and pros
pectors had scoured the country
but none believed the dazed man
would attempt the hazardous
task of climbing the steep moun
tains.
Mr. Chapman decended from
the mountain, abandoned his trip
and sent word to the officials in
Lordsburg of his grewsome find.
On Tuesday morning a coterie
composed of Justice of the Peace
C. W. Marsalis, Constable Oscar
Allen, Bramble B. Ownby andj
Fans V. Bush motored to the 1
Conner ranch east of Red Rock!
where a jury was formed by !
Messers Allen, 'Lige and Antony
Conner, Knox, Brakefield," and ,
Bush. Together they set out for:
the summit of Richolite peak.
For several hours the ragged
mountain was searched and finally
in one of the most inaccessible
points over five hundred feet
from the base of the mountain,
the body was discovered by Con
stable Allen. The aged prospect
or was lying beneath a cluster of
shaggy pine trees in a small gully,
his face upturned and his
fists clenched. One of the party
stooped over and picked up a card
on which was printed:
"I've noticed when a feHow dies, no nintter what '
he's been-
A saintly cluip or one whose life was darkly
steeiK-(i ill sin--IIU
friends Toruet the bitter wortls they Fpoke
but yester.lity.
And now they findainul'.itmleof pretty things
to say,
1 fancy when I no to rest some one will brinir to
linht.
Some kindly word or goodly deed Ions buried
out of sitjlit.
I'm quite alive nud well today, and while I linger
here
Lend me a helpinn h;md at llmrs--nnd Rive
, n word of cheer,
Just chnnue the minie of life a bit; just kindly
swah the decks.
For 1 will he no jtxlue of flowers when I cash
in my checks." ,
This poem had doubtless been
the dying prospector's last
reading. i
The decomposed body was
wrapped into blankets and taken j
by his partner down the broken
mountain side to the Red Rock
cemetery where it was interred.
Van Houten was a member of
the Moose lodge of El Paso. He
is survived by a sister in Canada
who ha3 been notified of the
finding of the body.
