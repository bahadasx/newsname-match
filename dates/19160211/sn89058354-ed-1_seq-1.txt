REPUBLICANS
GALL COUNTY
CONVENTION
Henry county's delegation to
the state Republican convention
will be instructed for D. M. No
bles for delegate to the National
convention and further than that
it will not be tied up.
This is a tip given a represen.
tative of The Parisian, by a lead
ing local Republican following
the meeting of the county G. 0.
P. committee Saturday.
It is possible, however, that
the county convention, which
was called for January 19,' may
instruct for Ben Hooper for vice
president according to a rumor
now current in county Republi
can circles.
The local leader who gave the
reporter his tip on the coming
convention also said that there
was very little; in the much
talked Beasley-Sanders fight.
He said that he did not believe
there would be much antagon
ism between the two factions.
According to his view former
Governor Hooper will be one of
the delegates from the state-at-large
to the national convention
and Congressman Sam R. Sells, .
y of the First district, will be thei

day was a very quiet affair and
continued only a' few "minutes.
Dr. E. M. Culley, county chair
man, called the gathering to or

adoption of a resolution calling
the county convention for Satur
day, January 19, for the purpose
of reorganizing the county com
mittee and electing delegates to
state, district and congressional
conventions. The motion was
seconded by W. 0. Hall and
unanimously adopted.
There is considerable senti

former Governor Hooper for the
vice-presidency. They might pre

HOSS TRADER PULLS
DEAL;MAKE OR LOSE?
Recently there has come to light the details of a "hoss" trade,
or rather several trades, in which two Henry county traders and a
, band of gypsies were participants. Owing to the prominence of
the parties thejnames are'withheld. However, the story is vouched
. for by a reliable citizen of the county.
A man traded a registered Duroc-Jersey sow and t en pigs
(pigs from a former litter sold at $5.00 each,) together with a 125
pound registered little-bone Berkshire shoat, to a band of gypsies
for a flea-bitten grey mare, 12 years old, and gave $15.00 as boot.
On t!he following day he hitched the mare to his buggy and
he proceeded to kick the buggy to pieces (repairs cost $4.95) be
sides painfully injuring his wife, who was in the.buggy at the time.
Becoming disgusted with the mare, the trader swapped her
back to the gypsies for a blind horse, 19 years old, (horse cost gyp
sies $4.50) and gave $10.00 as boot.
Later, he swapped the horse to another trader for a mule and
gave $2.00 as boot. When he started to put the mule in his past
ure, animal fell into a ditch about two feet in width and one foot in
depth. The first trader got the second trader to help pull the
mule out of the ditch, and when they had landed said mule on dry
J vid it died. The second trader was given the hide (which he later
Tanld for $2.00) in payment for his
trader paid a negro $1.50 to drag the mule's carcass away and
bury it.
The uroblem. which is yet unsolved, is how much did the first
trader lose by all of his trades
had he deposited the price of the
riven as boot and spent for repairs, in some bank at 4 per cent
interest? -

It was only by accident that
the attorneys learned of Mitch

startling reply.

It i3 probable that an effort will

The Bull Moose faction in the
county, which numbered around
500 in 1912 has indicated wheth
er or not they will enter the con
vention. If they should, it will
be with a view of controlling it.
The Moose are ' solidly behind
Roosevelt' for the Republican
nomination while the Republi
cans are inclined to support Jus
tice Hughes or some other lead
er from the East.
A hot time is likely in the Re
publican pow-wow Saturday
week, despite assertions to the
contrary, and the only sure bet
seems to be that Mr. Nobles will
get the county's instructions for
delegate from the Eighth, disr
trict to the National convention.
If an effort should be made to
endorse any candidate for presi

will be for Justice Hughes, who

watch for it in the future. It will be issued every two

I
Dorsey B. Thomas, of Camden,
has announced his candidacy for
the Democratic nomination for
Congress, making the race a
three-cornered affair as Dudley
Porter, of Paris, and Congress
man T. -W. Sims have already
signified their intention to make
the fight. - .
, Mr. Thomas is a former mem
ber of the State Senate and at
present is a clerk in the State
TreasUBer's ' office at Nash ville.
His entry into the Congressional
fight was not unexpected since
he attended the recent meeting
of the committee at Lexington.
and has - been conferring with
friends over the district for ten
days or two weeks.
His; friends believe that he
will Kl a strong candidate, al-
thoufcJ the friends of Mr. Porter
and Congressman Sims are
equally confident of the success
of their respective favorites.
Regardless of who wins the
nomination the race in the Eighth
district is going to be warm be
tween now and August 3, when
the primary will be held. It is
not expected that the candidates
will begin speaking before late
in March or early in April, but
from that time on no doubt Mr.
Porter and Mr. Thomas, at least,
will be on the hustlings.

One or more member of the
county road commission, holding
under the so-called Henry coun
ty road law, will resign the po
sitions they are supposed to
hold in the immediate future,
according to rumors now in cir
culation. The contention that the Rob
ertson and Haywood county
road act replaces the Henry
county law has been upheld by
the state Supreme Court in a
number of similar cases, and
there is very little doubt ex
pressed now but that Henry
county's : old law - bi ixbejen
knocked completely ouf and
that the other statute takes its
place.
Under the Henry county law
the county had five road commis
sioners W. F. Thompson, Geo
McGehee, John Richardson, J.
H. Blake and one other to be ap
pointed by the County Judge,
succeeding John T. Vandyck,
who resigned upon being elected
Road Supervisor.

members, to be chosen by the
