New and Handsome lllfh School of
Orcfon Is Formally
Dedicated.
The future of a city, Its moral and
material welfare ami It possibilities
of culture, advancement ami clvlllr.a
tlon, depend In a large measure on
the youth of today. Tlie bjysoftn
day will be the merchant, hanker;,
mechanics, minister!), Iaw)ers and
statesmen of tomorrow: tint girls will
become the mothers of generation'
)et unborn, and hath will transmit ti
their progeny their own traits, w belli
er natural or acquired, The learner
have been hoiured among all nation'
ancient and modern, but ll Is only o.
a comparatively late date that the
youth of the land have been provided
with the advantage Mich as an now
furnished In the curriculum of the
public school", which comprises a
course which a generation or two ago
was only attainable by the children of
the wealthy. In the nutter ot educa
tional facilities, Oregon ha not nnly
kept up with the march of progress,
ad
but ha outstripped cities of more
pretentious proportions, Her natural
facilities and advantages are not sur
pased. It Is within llftcen minutes'
ride of the main Hue of the C , II. ,V
) railroad, via The Oregon Interur
ban railroad, which was built by the
cltUent of Oregon.
No town In our great state has a
more Intelligent class of clti.eiis,
more rellned and cultured society (the
term Is used In Its broadest sense i In 1
treating of this subject, a prominent
gentleman recently sail: "Oregon
was originally founded by an Intolll-,
gent class of people, and during the
whole period of Uh history It his con-
tinned to draw unto Itself, under lht'be replaced for any sum less than lids,
law of alllnlty, as It were, residents of j The study hall and three diss

"tnliiently distinguished as a city
wherelnthestandardof Intellectuality,
rellnement, morality, and similar
qualities Is exceptionally high, The
evidence of the traits Is to be seen In ,
many ways In our city In the num
ber of her churches and the member-
hip of her congregations, In the cost.

In the whole tenor and tone of public
and private life In the community,
She maintains a Chautauqua saclety
with a strong membership. No city
of her sUe has a higher order of musi
cal talent."
During February, 11)15, a petition
numerously signed by the patrons of
the district was tiled with our Hoard
of Kducatlon, asking that they sub
mit a proposition to the voters of the
district to bond the district In the
sum of i'J'i.uoo, for the erection of
a new high school building. The
board granted the prayer of the peti
tioners, and at the April, lut.'i, school
election, the proposition canted by
the handsome vote ot I'd In favor of
the proposition and 40 against It.
Thus again showing their progressive
spirit, and registering t heir approval
of keeping their city In the first rank
of educational interest.
On the hearty approval of the pat
rons In favor of the proposition the
school board became "hustlers" at
once, and the result was plans and
specifications were at once prepared,
bids let, and by July the contract was
let to a Mr. Schragg, of St, Joseph,
for the erection of the building, and
work: was commenced at once, the
plumbing being let by separate con
tract, and with the coming of the
holiday season of 1010, the building
'was completed, and during the holl-
ilajs the furniture, desks, seats, etc.,
were placed In position, and, on Mon
day, January :id, the new structure
was occupied by the superintendent
and his aids and the students of the
high school, and their work began.
Three hundred and three of these
young men and women have none out
from this old school since .s7(l to
light life's battles, and have made
good In their chosen llelds of labor
the law, medicine, school, mercantile
and various kinds of business. The
women havu attained prominence as
iducators, and many have taken up
i)n themselves those responsibilities
that come to motherhood, ami have
raised families, that llielf children
night return to the old school and
take that training that came to them
n their school days.
"How deur to my heart are the
scenes of my childhood," ami so It
Koes on world without end.
! The building Is of brick, with stone
coping, niitVi feet, three stories, In-
'eluding the haemeiit. which has a
, It' foot celling. In thMthi' g) mnas.

The tlrl llnor above this has four
recitation moms, superlntetibnt's
otllce, ho-pltsl room, laboratory, etc,
J he second lluor Is occupied by a
study hall and gaPcry Its seating
capacl'y Is atoui .VM. It also has a,
library
The heating plant Is locattd In the
old bill ding.
i lie people or this district were
fortunate In having so substantial a
building as the present one, which Is
now used for the grades exclusively;
It Is inor'e nly equipped with lights,
heat and laboratory, ami by coot Inn
lug the use of this building, it means
a saving to the tx avers of some
M- K for we do not believe It could
and seats, and the rooms with arm
chairs and desks, the desks being In
cherry and chairs In oak
The walls and i-elllugs are In sand
II nisi In gray. The laboratory Is com-
plelo In Its equipment, with a large
bay window for prupagatlng purposes.
Kvery detail looking to the comfort
of faculty and students has been care
fully studied and carried out. There
may be larger high school structures
In our state but nowhere within Its
borders Is there a more complete one
In Its appointments, dimensions con
sldered, and It Is a source of pride to
every Individual cltlen of the school
district
In addition to this complete and
handsome structure the school board
has leased ground from Karl Kenton,
on the east side, and opposite side of
tie street, and erected a large and
commodious ;ii stall shelter barn for
the accommodation of outside stu
dents, who drive In and nut dally
It was the Intention of the school
board and teachers, and patrons to
hold becoming dedicatory exercises on
the occupancy of the new building,
but owing to the extreme weather
conditions, and an epidemic of the
grippe prevailing, and several of the
directors being sick, it was deemed
advisable to postpone these exercbes,
and this was done until Friday even-
lug of last week. 1'ebruar.v 4, when tl,u
exercises were hold, In the handsome
study hall of the building. Notwith
standing the Inclemency of the weath
er, the steady fall of snow through
out tho day, the study hall was well
tilled with patrons of the district, of
licors and members of tho board and
the school faculty, to show their ap,
preclatlon of having so splendid a
high school building, and manifest
their hearty approval and endorse
ment of the action of the school
board In their efforts to comply with
the wishes of the voters of the dis
trict In voting so heartily In favor of
this Important forward step.
The program furnished came from
local talent, with the exception of
Prof Ira Richardson, a 'Holt county
production, who Is now at the head of
the Maryvllle Normal school, and con-
slsted of Impromptu talks from sev
ers! of our cltl.ens, Judge S. F.
O'Killtli and Prof. Itlchardson, Joe
II. Murray, president of the board,
and charming musical numbers by
members of the High school senior
class.
Mr Murray, as president of the
bjtrd, gave an Interesting talk on the
history pertaining to the building of
the new High school structure from
lis very Inception to the completion
and acceptance of the building. He
also rendered an exhaustive account-
lug of the moiiejs expended, from
whet.ee derived, thusale of Hid bonds.

rrof. Ira lilchardsiin, presl.lent of
the Maryvllle Normal School, spoke
on educational lines, showing the
needs of a high school education -the
times demanded It-and the young
manor woman who expects to make
a success would (Ind a real help by"
having a high school education at
least The demands of the day In all
llelds of labor and profession were
men and women-true men and wo
men, ami the Impending changes de
manded this character of education,
audit was the duty of the fathers
and mothers of today to lend every
encouragement to their hovs and girls
to lie prepared for l he demands of to
morrow, and the sentiment of com
munities must get away from the old
Idea of things, and become In liar
mony witli the demaniN of the new
orderof things, and to do this a high
school education was essential. The
professor's talk was elevating, en
couraglng and wasgreatly appreciated
by the large audience
I'rof Itlchardson Is another of our
Holt county boys that has made good
every way In ids chosen Held of labor
He Is the son of S, V. Itlchardson
and wife, and was raised In Mound
City, and graduated from Its high
school In the class of 1mi, under the
superintendent of I'rof. V. S. Hear
moot. After teaching successfully
for several years In various schools of
the slate, he was made a member of
the faculty of the Maryvllle Normal
In lull, and In llil.l became Its presl
dent.
It was a happy thought on tho
part of the program makers for this
occasion, that Judge S. V. O'l-'allon
was selected to make an address, he
being the tlrst young man to gradu
ate from the Oregon High school-It
was then called a Normal school.
The Judge opened Ills remarks by
compll.nentlng the people for their
decision at the polls and the board for
their labor and ellorls In giving our
people so handsome a building and
for keeping their i'xpndllureswlthln
their revenue, lie spoke of the great
contrast between this building and
the early day struct tires here-of the
school accommodations when he was
a school lad with those nf today, and
of the great strides made along edu
cational lines. Thaltheconstrucllon
of the new building was only another
evidence of the advanced educational
spirit that hail ever characterized the
city of Oregon; and he believed this
spirit would ever predominate In our
people,
There were many here In our midst
who attended the eatly day schools
and gone along noting the changes
and wonderful advances that have
been made along educational lines
boys then whoyet remember the great
tight, here In 1873 for the new school
building which today stands and now
becomes the graded school building.

President Wilson's Swing.

Ills address at Kansas City last
