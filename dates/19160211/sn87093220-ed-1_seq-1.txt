Councilmen Decide Mc-
Dermoth Shall Buy
Food Wholesale
Disposition of garbage in Aberdeen j
provoked considerable discussion at
Wednesday night's city council ses
sion. It started from a complaint,
made through Councilman J. D. Walk
' «r, that garbage cans in many sec
, >ns had been knocked down and the ;
' v .itents scattered. It is practically .
to catch these offenders,
stated councilmen. Councilman An- ,
ton Pista declared that garbage col- ,
lections should be free, anyway, the .
cost of the work being included in
tlie tax levy. To this Councilman ,
James Empey objected that it would ]
be difficult to make some "fly by i
night" restaurants, here today, there ,
tomorrow, pay any such tax. Pista
retorted that the owner of the prop- j
crt.v could pay and add it to the rent. ]
Empey moved that future purchas- i
es of provisions for charity be made <
by Rev. Charles McDermoth in whole- ,
sale lots. Motion carried, after some
' discussion in which Empey picked
holes in choice of purchases recent
ly made from a local grocery to re
lieve a needy family. One purchase l
was of a 50-cent bottle of salad oil. i
The $43 paid by Mayor J. M. Phil
lips to unemployed men to clear snow t
from the streets, last week, was or- :
dered charged to the charity fund. !
Bids for the city printing, from the
Grays Harbor Post and Aberdeen i
World, were referred to the finance
committee. The Post bid 3 cents an
inch for first and 2 cents for sub
sequent insertions; the World 4 cents
each first and subsequent insertions, i
City Engineer L. D. ICc-lsoy was in- i
structed to furnish estimates for i
.street construction in the West End, i
likely to be started in the spring. Or- ,
dinance was passed providing for ]
making a 20-foot graveled roadway l
on the south side of East Market ,
street from C to P. Supt. Lind- (
strom's request that he be given a i
clerk in the water department was
referred to finance and auditing com
mittees. Bids from four firms for j
furnishing 17,500 feet of pipe to the j
water department were referred to 1
the water committee and superintend- 1
ent. The council decided to vifit the •

LINCOLN
WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT'S ODE FOR THE
MARTYRED PRESIDENT'S OBSEQUIES
READ IN NEW YORK, APRIL 25, 1865
Oh, slow to smite and swift to spare,
Gentle and merciful and just,
Who, in the fear of God, didst bear
The sword of power, a nation's trust.
In sorrow by thy bier we stand,
Amid the awe that hushes all,
And speak the anguish of a land
That shook with horror at thy fall.
Thy task is done; the bonds are free.
We bear thae to an honored grave,
Whose proudest monument shall be
The broken fetters of the .slave.
Pure was thy life; its bloody close
Hztth placed thee with the sons of light,
Among the noble host of those
Who perished in the cause of Right.

COMING INDUSTRY
Speakers Depict Condi
tions Here When Log
ging Is Done
! The dinner given by the Chamber
: of Commerce at the Washington Ho
tel on Tuesday night was a decided
success: the'repast itself was exceed
ingly good and finely served; the one
feature that was deplored was the
fact that so many of our storekeep
ers, business men and merchants
seem absolutely indifferent to the wel
fare of this city and were so largely
j conspicuous by their absence. Left
I to a whole let of them this city would
I oon be a whistling station. The
meeting was one to beaten and en
courage the dairy and farm interests
of this section. There was no en
deavor on the part of any of the
speakers to indulge in oratory, they
stuck to their text, got down to brass
tacks and' handed out a line of in
struction and information that if fol
| lowed would be certain to bear good
j results.
| The Northern Pacific railway, in
I taking these experts through this
j county on a special train, is surely
I doing a great work. The keynote of
; the evening was more dairying, more
! farming, more and better live stock.
■ C. E. Arney, western immigration
and industrial agent of the Northern
I Pacific, was the first speaker. He
said "that in order to succeed that
I the people must be interested in the
railroads and the railroads must b«3
interested in the people, any other
way would lead to injury all around.
The dairying and cattle industry was
of prime importance, live stock must
be in the land, if any improvement
Is to result. The barriers must be
broken down between the townspeople
and the farmer, the farmer covets the
friendship bond. In a reasonable way
credits must be extended to the farm
ers and loans must be made by the
banks. There must be more mutual
interest shown; the spirit of neglect
ing, ignoring and taking advantage of
the farmer has got to be eliminated if
this town is to shape proper growth.
The prices on land are altogether too
high aitd out of all proportion to its
real value. The agents will not send
us more farmers unless those who
are already here are doing well; they
will be sent to other sections where
conditions are reasonable and a farm
er has a fair show. Help the farm
er. do everything you can to encour
age him, for before many years you
will need him very badly."
Prof. D. E. Willard of St. Paul, gave
some very straight information. He
said, "the producing value of ou!
lands in this section has not been
fully-tested, and he found that they
were a good deal better than most
people thought they were. The senti
ment of a community in a large meas
ure makes that community good or
bad. Lots of the' land around here
should be offered as low as $10.00 an
acre on very long time payments.
The present prices drove all the pros
pective purchasers away. The rail
roads are hauling into Aberdeen clear
from the Mississippi valley cows,
bogs chickens, eggs, etc., whereas
this city ought to be growing enough
for our own consumption and have lots
of it to ship away. Get good stock
keep improving in the herds; the
better the grade of cows the more
re-enue you get. Scrub cows should
all be e'iminated. The people of the
towns must create the market and no
matter what the farmer brings in it
must find a sale at a proper price
if it is inferior, then a lower pric"
must be paid, but the farmer must
be shown how to market his product
in better shape so as to bring a high
er price. All hay and grain should
be grown here and not have to be
shipped in."
•T. M. Price, of the Washington
State College followed in the same
strain. He said: "A poor cow is an
absolute loss. She does not pay for
her keep. There was altogether too
much friction between the farmer and
the business men in the town. Every
owner of a cow must keep improving
the stock and go after high produc
ers, that is the way in which success
could be made."
C. F. Monroe, county agriculturist,
also spoke, saying he was ready and
willing to help in any way and on
every opportunity.
Mr. Addison Bennet, an old friend
of Grays Harbor, and representing
the Oregonian, said there was a great
future before this section if only we
would go at it right and he said he
| had seen enough to know that prac-
VOLUME 30.
tically everything would grow and.
prosper here. The Grays Harbor
country is the cow's paradise. Tfie"
time would soon come when for 20
to 30 miles of our timber would be
cleared off the lands around this city,
then he asked what are you going
to do if you do not have a farming and
dairying country.
It is useless for us to think that
success comes out of the blue sky
or that Aberdeen's lumber will alsQ
be here in abundance, other towns
will grow in the sections where it ia
cut and we will be left behind un
less more interest is taken in this
new and growing industry.
