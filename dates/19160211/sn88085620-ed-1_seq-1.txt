Shingleweavers Hold
Enthusiastic Meeting
New Organization Effected and Officers
Elected
Last Tuesday evening it seemed
something like old times in the Labor
Temple when a room full of erstwhile
timberworkers, >iow shingleweavers.
met to reorganize their union under
the old form, as per instructions from
the national office of the A. F. of L,
The timberworkers' union is dead.
Long live the revived shingleweavers!
Brother Robert Mills was elected
Secretary-Treasurer and —never mind,
just now, who the other officers are.
Suffice it to say that the turn-out
was big, full of promise, enthusiasm
and go!
In this connection it is encouraging
to note that President Marsh, oT the
State Federation of Labor, and Inter
national President Brown, of the
Shingleweavers' Union of America,
are meeting with success in Willapa
and Grays Harbor, reorganizing the
"timber wolves."
Secretary Mills will have a report of
furl her progress for next week's is
sue of The Labor Journal.
SHINGLEWEAVERS ARE
AGAIN ORGANIZING
CONDITIONS IMPROVING
Report of Sec.-Treas. Reid
Seattle, Wash.
To the Officers and Members of Lo
cal Unions —Greeting:
The unusual severe winter weather
on the Pacific Coast during the past
five weeks, with the attending cessa
tion of shingle manufacturing, has
necessitated an indefinite postpone
ment of the reorganization among the
shingleweavers, but it will be prose
cuted as soon as possible.
In a visit to Blame, Wash., the lat
ter part of January, President Brown
signed a trade agreement with the
Blame Manufacturing Co., Ihe co
operative shingle mill of that city.
Also, the members of the crew are
members of the union and will have
their coats off to keep the Belling
ham local, with which they are affili
ated, pushing the work of the shingle
• weavers during the year.
On the 2Sth ult., a reorganization
meeting was held in Marysville, the
second during the month. In spite
of the cold and snow, a good crowd
was In attendance. The local has se
cured the exclusive use of a store
building on the main street, to be
used for both a meeting place and a
. rendezvous for the members when
not working, (.'hairs, tables and lit
erature have been provided. A live
committee, consisting of one member
1 from each mill in the town, has been
appointed to canvass their respective
» working places. The local has de
clared its intention of having every
shingle weaver in its jurisdiction
"lined up" hy March 1.
International President Brown and
President Marsh of the Washington
State Federation of Labor are this
we ek working in Willapa and Grays
Harbor in the interests of the reor
ganization campaign that is taking
. shape in both those centers.
In addition to hiß duties at inter
national headquarters the undersigned
will devote as much time as possible
♦ In the organization field until condi
tions again become normal. This
•* will effect a considerable financial
saving to the organization. This plan,
of course, will necessitate the closing
} of headquarters while the writer Is
on the road, but not more than two
or three days at a time.
This office has been flooded with
letters from local unions and lay mem
ben strongly endorsing the reorgani
zation program. But one local reg
istered a protest, which, it appears,
' was offered under an misapprehen
sion. Many locals are holding largely
attended and enthusiastic meetings
* and delinquent members are fast re
instating.
As previously announced, the publi
cation of our official organ, The
' Shingle Weaver, will be resumed at
the earlteet possible date. Already
bids tor Its printing have been called
i
for. The management of the Seattle
Union Record, the official organ of
| the Central Labor Council of Seattle
and vicinity and one of the best, labor
papers published, has made a tenta
tive proposal to combine the two
periodicals. The proposition will be
carefully considered. Until the mail
ing list can completely be revised,
The Shingle Weaver will be sent in
bundles to local secretaries, stewards
and others. Due notice of the date of
the first issue will be given in an
other bulletin.
| Red cedar shingles are quoted, f.o.b.
mills: *A* $1.35, Clears $1.80, with
the prospect further advances soon.
The Redwood shingle market also is
in a healthy condition. The mills in
Humbolt county, California, many of
which have been closed during the
past two years, are resuming opera
tions.
It is the unanimous belief of the
manufacturers, wholesalers and re
tailers that 1910 will be a banner year
in the shingle industry. Shingle mill
operatives can benefit by such condi
tions only through organization.
Substantial wage increases have
been granted employes in other lines
of industry, in most cases without the
necessity of resorting to strikes. It
is not a coincidence that invariably
those who benefited were members of
organized labor, belonging to unions
of numerical and financial strength.
Last week the crew of the Allen
Shingle Co. mill, located near Tort
land, Ore, went on strike for a slight
increase of wages. As was to be ex
pected, within forty-eight hours their
places were filled by strike-breakers.
Even yet the members of the old
crew see no benefits in organization, j
Indeed, "Consistency, thou art a jew
el."
That possibilities also exist tor the
organization of the other branches of
the timber industry on the craft basis
is evidenced by the interest manifest
In different localities, particularly at
Marinette. Wis.; Menominee, Mich.;
ISraidwood, 111., and Maben, W. Va.
Needless to say, this international
will render all possible assistance in
the organization of the loggers and
sawmill workers, either by organiz
ing local unions with direct affilia
tion with the American Federation of
Labor, or separate international char
ters from the parent body. Communi
cations addressed to the undersigned
pertaining to the formation of local
unions of those branches will receive
careful attention.
Anyone knowing the whereabouts
of J. It. Manthy, for some time em
ployed in the vicinity of Littlerock,
Wash., will please notify Brother Jas.
P. Daly, secretary No. 25, Littlerock,

Report of President E. P. Marsh
of State Federation of Labor
(Continued From Last Week)
WAGE SCALE TELLS STORY
A partial survey made by the Com
mission and embodied in the first bi
ennial report, shows the following:
In 1913, 1758 girls in 24 mercantile
establishmets received less than $10
per week. In 1914, after the law be
came operative, but 561 received less
than that amount.
In 1913, in mercantile establish
ments, 370 females were receiving $10
per week. In 1914, 1323 females were
receiving that amount.
In mercantile establishments in
1913, 1431 females were receiving a
weekly wage running from $10 to $35.
In 1914 this number was increased to
2541 females.
The same report shows In 1913, 286
laundry workers receiving less than
$9 per week. In 1914 but 46 laundry
girls were receiving less than $9.
In 1913, 66 laundry girls were re
ceiving $9 per week, while in 1914, 267
were receiving that amount.
Three hundred seventy-nine female
laundry workers were receiving more
than $9 weekly in 1913, while in 1914,
589 were receiving more than $9.
In telephone employment 603 girls
were receiving less than $9 in 1913,
while in 1914 but 359 were receiving
less than that amount.
In 1913 but 64 telephone girls re
ceived $9 per week and this number
in 1914 was raised to 129.
In 1913, 437 telephone girls receiv
ed over $9 weekly, in 1914. 732 girls
received more than $9.
That the general wage rate of fe
male workers has been raised, seems
to be an established fact. It is al
most needless to add that females be
longing to labor organizations were
receiving the minimum wage rate or
better before the law was passed and
scarcely needed such legislation.
Many of the dire things predicted as
a result of this law did not happen,
the employers in most instances ap
pearing willing to give the law a fair
trial, hoping to raise the general stan
dard of efficiency.
In some establishments it is report
ed that a life-size imitation of the
"Taylor System" has been Inaugurat
ed and these will doubtless receive
the future attention of the commis-
sion.
After all is said and done, economic
organization on the industrial field
has no cause to take a back seat for
minimum wage legislation as an effi
cient method of bettering the condi
tions of women In industry.
UNEMPLOYMENT AND LAND
Two years ago the convention au
thorized the appointment of a com
mittee to study unemployment and re

committee was appointed, made its
report, and was continued another

YOUR OPPORTUNITY
A LAUDABLE ENTERPRISE \
One of the many laudable enter
prises launched by organised labor in
both Seattle and Tacoma last winter,
and continuing In Tacoma this win
, ter, was the course of lectures by
I professors of the University of Wash
ington, and other eminent scholars,
dealing with the history of labor or
ganizations, with social progress In
general, and with various biological
problems in relation to human bet
toruit nt.
Tlie natter of having this course ot
tree lectures given in Everett was
brought before the Trades Council
last year, but not sufficient interest
was manifested to warrant inaugurat
ing the course here under the aus
pices of organized labor.
However, a number of unionists
have joined forces with an organiza
tion of Everett students known as the
Social Science Study Club, most of
whose members are sens and daugh
ters of working people. Under the
auspices of this association of serious
minded wage workers, the course of
lectures given before the Central l.a
bor Council of Tacoma and Seattle
has been secured for Everett, and
ate being given each Sunday evening
at The Forum, Ml* California St.,
between Colby and Wetmore.
The first lecture of ihe course was
delivered by Prof. J N Bowman, and

white labor, women and girl workers
finding work in the canneries during
the rush season, lasting generally but
a few weeks. The past few years
j have been abnormally dull in the tim
ber industry, some of the mills being
closed entirely and others running on
part time. The white labor, finding
I unemployment prevalent, was forced
Into idleness, running heavy bills for
the necessities of life. The only hope
was employment in the canneries dur
ing the busy season. Disappointment
was keen when shortly before the ex
pected run of fish Japanese appeared
in large numbers. Various versions
of what followed have been given me
by both laboring and business men
of Anacortes. I interviewed labor
men. officers of the chamber of com
merce, city officials and merchants.
As near as I can ascertain the facts
. they are as follows.
THE ANACORTES FIGHT
The Japanese labor is responsible
tor the acute situation that arose.
White labor had become somewhat
used to Chinese in certain lines of
cannery work from long contact with
it. Tlie Japanese were said to be
more arrogant, harder to deal with
commercially. One business man told
me he would rather have the trade of
one Chinaman than a dozen Japs. The
rapid influx of Japanese, while the
whites stood around with their hands
in their pockets, enraged the public
to the danger point.
The storm center of the town was
Ed O'Grady, a union longshoreman
and j) resident of the local central
body. He sensed the impending trou
ble and it is agreed by prominent
business men of the town that he
tried hard to avert it. He appealed
personally to officials of the Chamber
of Commerce to get merchants, can
nerymen and laborers together in
conference looking toward a peaceful
solution of the labor problem. Noth
ing came of this effort and threats of
violence multiplied. Covert threats
to burn the canneries if the Japs were
not fired were said to have been
made. A mass meeting of protest
was called and on the night of July
20th, 1916, the council chamber was
packed with citizens. The council
meeting adjourned and the protest
meeting was organized, one of the
city councilmen acting as chairman
and the city clerk acting as secretary
Speeches were made by O'Grady and
Rev. Harry Ferguson. A motion pre
vailed that a committee wait imme
diately upon cannery managers and
acquaint them with the expression of
the townspeople that tip' Japs must
be replaced by white labor. O'Grady .

City (Kocefeller) Hank In the publi
cations with which it is flooding the
country.
This is the bank whose president,
F. A. Vanderlip, has organized a fifty
million dollar corporation to exploit
foreign markets and the natural re
sources of foreign lands.

the campaign of the Rockefeller bank
for unrestricted immigration and low

In the issue of "The Americas," just
published by the bank, appears a

control, as the best means of coping
with European competition. The
bank says:
"It is hardly necessary for anybody

of the German super-organibation of
industry ought to be attempted here
since it seems to be coming along
naturally. There appears to be a

There has never been a time in the
past when members of the working
class have not found fault with public
officials—these officials either did or
did not do things that were not ap
proved of.
One of the principal reasons why
these officials do or do not. do these
things that are not approved of is
that they are not in full understand
ing of any sympathy with the work
ers. Another is that the workers do
not express themselves to an extent
;to impress public officials with the
necessity of representing the working
class as well as the employing class

handled by the workers if they will

"Military' service, for labor, may
be analogous to higher education and
technical courses for business admin
