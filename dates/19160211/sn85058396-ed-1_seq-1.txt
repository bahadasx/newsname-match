developing unprecedented activity and
constantly shelling camps, artillery

trains in the name of the young
grand duke. A total of 33,000 testa
ments already have been distributed

Review of War Situation.
The western war front Is still the
central field of military interest. Lat
est reports show no signs of a lessen
ing in the Intensity of the violent
struggle which has been going on for
several days in the vicinity of Vimy
and Neuville, near the Belgian border,
while .farther south along the line
there are signs of reawakening activ
ity on the part of both Germans and
French
In Belgium, according to unofficial
reports, there has been a notable ar
tillery battle in progress during the
last ten days near Ypres, but the opin
ion appears to prevail among military
observers that the Germans have de
cided to postpone their predicted of
fensive until more favorable weather
prevails. They are reported very
busy, however, in strengthening their
lines.
In Russia the artillery play on the
Riga-Dvinsk front is notably heavy
in character, but the infantry does not
appear to have been active. In Vol
hynia the Russians report a forward
movement in the character of a hill
between the fortresses of Rovno and
Lutsk, but the latest Austrian reports
claim that Emperor Nicholas' troops
have been held to their old positions
in Galicia an'd on the Bessarabian
frontier.
Russia to Issue Loan.
Petrograd, Feb. 11, via London,
1:50 p. m. Newspapers of this city
report that the government has de
cided to issue in tho near future a
new interior loan of two billion rubles
at 5 per cent under the same condi
tions as the preceding one.
Under normal exchange conditions
the equivalent in American money
of two billion rubles would be ap
proximately 31,000.000,000. The pre
ceding Russian loan issued laBt No
vember was for one billion rubles. It
was sold at 95, pays 5 1-2 per cent
and runs for ten years.

244 feet long, was built In 1882 and
owned In Christiania.
Petrograd, via London, Feb. 11. A
dispatch from Teheran sayB that As

Russians some time ago.
Germany Claims Part of Belgium.
London, Feb. 11, 1:45 p. ra. Recent
Information gathered in government
circles In Berlin is that Germany
holds that a portion of Belgium should
be annexed to Germany In any settle
ment of tho war which is undertaken.
This view is directly the reverse of
tho recent report coming through It
aly that Germany had offered to evac
uate Belgium as a condition of a sep
arate peace.
There Is no confirmation of-th re-
uate Belgium, but the contrary view
that Germany desires to retain part
of that country probablj' will be made
known In confidential advices goingto
the American authorities, indicating a
less favorable outlook than had been
expected.
German Raid Report.

AUSTRIA SENDS
NOTE TO NATIONS
All Neutral Powers Are Noti
fied of Decision to Treat
Armed Merchantmen
as Warships.
BRITISH ILLEGAL ACTS
Vessels Use Guns Aboard to
Attack and Destroy Enemy
Warships in Contraven
tion of Law.
Vienna, Feb. 10, via London, Feb
11, 2 p. m The text of the memoran
dum communicated by the Austro
Hungarian foreign office today to tho
representatives of .neutral govern
ments, announcing the decision of
Austria-Hungary to treat as warships
armed merchantmen of countries nt
war with this nation, Is as follows:
"It is not unknown to tho govern
ments of neutral countries that the
British admiralty In the course of the
vear 1913 caused a number of large
British liners to be armed The first
lord of the admiralty declared In the
house of commons on March 26, 1913,
that the armament of the vessels In
question was only to protect them
from dangers threatening them from
hostile ships converted into auxiliary
cruisers, and to serve exclusively for
defense.
Merchantmen Attack Warships.
"Experiences gained in the present
war show that a considerable number
of British merchantmen used the guns
Installed aboard against hostile war
ship and not solely to escape legal
exercise of the prize right, but also
to attack and destroy enemy warships.
"As is evident from the memoran
dum which the imperial German gov
ernment today communicated to neu
tral states instructions have been
aboard British steamers which prove
that the British government Itself In
cited Us merchantmen to Illegal acts
and this Is complete contradiction to
assurances which it communicated to
the state department at Washington.
Its allies, particularly France and It
aly, followed the example of Great
Britain during the course of hostili
ties. 'Without wishing to enter into an
explanation of tho surprising claim
advanced, by the British, government,
according to which liners armed by
that government retain their inoffen
sive character, while merchantmen
armed by the enemy are regardable
by the British naval forces as auxili
ary cruisers, the Austro-Hungarian
government limits itself to establish
ing that every merchantman provided
for any purpose whatever with can
non loses through this fact alono the
character of a non-combatant ship.
"Under these conditions tho order
has been given to the Austro-Hungar-fan
naval forces to treat such ships
as combatants an order which, how
ever, will be in force only from Febru
ary 29, 1915.
This delay is granted In the Inter
ests of neutral powers, In order that
they may be placed in a position to
warn their nationals of the danger to
which they will expose themselves If
they entrust their persons or property
to armed merchantmen of'states at war
with Austria-Hungary and also to noti
fy those of their nationals who may
already bo aboard ships of the abovo
mentioned character.
The ministry of foreign affairs has
the honor to request the embassy (or
legation) to bring the abovo tele
graphically to the attention of Its gov
ernment." oo
WILSON TO KEEP
II. S. OUT OF WAR
President Determined to Avoid
Conflict, If Possible, But
Trouble Merely Held at
Arm's Length.
REST OF WORLD HOT
Flame May Spread to United
States Without Our Ability
to Stop It.
Washington, Feb. 11. Delegates to
the annual convention of the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States left
for their homo today- carrying with
them a message from President Wil
son, the outstanding feature of which
was his determination to keep the
United States out of the European
conflict, although declaring that the
nation merely held that trouble at
arm's length.
The president was speaking on neu
trality at the annual banquet of tho
chamber which was a concluding fea
ture of a three days' convention. The
president also spoke of the need of a
real scientific tariff board and a
merchnat marine.
Patience Justified.
"It Is a cruel thing," said tho presi
dent, "to hae it supposed, as it is in
many quarters, that we have kept out
of this war simply because we wanted
to keep out of trouble and simply be
cause we wanted to protit by the
trouble of others, and yet misunder
standings for the time being are not
to be reckoned as against tho con
sciousness that we must, ourselves,
have that we have pursued the right
and only serviceable course. I am
not afraid of the slow verdict of his
tory with regard to the neutrality of
the United States and I believe that
we are justified In exercising oven'
degree of patience in making it clear
what our position is and how sincere
ly we are determined not to allow this
quarrel to become part of ours.
"I have only this to say, though we
hold this trouble at arm's length and
keep up our attempt to keep our own
judgment, the rest of the world is
hot and it may be that any time, with
out our -co-operation and without our
ability to stop it, tho flame may ex
tend to us. And iherefore I am glad
that the United States has been put in
a position to mobilize its financial re
sources and to get into the position
which it must at least get into, wheth
er It wants to or not.
Peace Means Prosperity
"If only we can keep this great na
tion at peace there is an Infinite
prospect of happy prosperity before
the United States."
The president spoke of tho federal
reserve law saying-
"When you reflect what might have
happened if our banking system had,
at the outset of thiu war, been the
clumsy and antiquated thing that it
was three years ago, you will realize
that not only might we not have
escaped disaster, but that disaster
might have been so prolonged that It
would have been impossible for the
United States to occupy the position
sho now occupies."
scientific Tariff Board
The president told of the necessity
of a scientific tariff board nnd said ho
thought the nation would get It.
"I want to say," he continued, "hat
before the whole fact of affairs was
changed in the economies of the
world by the war, I was not in favor
of a tariff board because the purpose
of It then was apparently to keep
alive an unprofitable controversy. I
am not Interested In the doctrines of
protection; I am not interested in the
doctrine of free trade. I have been
a college professor and know why I
am not, because there is nothing in
either doctrine. The only thing that
is interesting is the facts of com
merce and Industry and the only thing
that it is right to deduce from the
facts is something that has nothing
properly to do with party politics at
The president said that he hoped
legislation creating a merchant marine
would bo passed by congress as soon
aa possible.
REPORTERS VISIT
NORTH-SEA FLEET
Great Britain's Incomparable
Combination of Speed and
Gun Power Inspected by
Press Correspondents.
VETERAN FIGHTERS
Pride of Navy Is in Big Battle
Cruisers Which Have Borne
Brunt of War.
Somewhere-In-The-North-Sea, Via
London, Feb. 11, 11 a. m. Great Brit
ain's first lino offensive fleet, an In
comparable combination of Bpeed and
gun power ready for constant action,
was inspected yesterday by a party of
French and American correspondents
and a representative of The Associat
ed Press was permitted to view from
the bridge of a torpedo boat the naval
unit which is expected to meet tho
first shock of a German attack.
In the fleet were virtually all the
veteran fighting craft which have
been in action in this war, but they
showed few scars with the exception
of an occasional dent in their armor.
The pride of place was held by batle
cruisers which in engagements from
the Falkland Isles to the Dardanelles
have borne the brunt of the sea fighting:.
Huge Ships Hold Premier Position.
Unpopular with officers and men
before the war, because they were
constantly coaling, and never more
than cautiously praised by the propo
nents of the super-dreadnought pol
icy these huge fighting machines hold
the premier position in the British
navy in which warship speed is now
regarded as the first and moBt import
ant principle of naval strategy.
The correspondents left the naval
base under a sunny sky and on reach
ing the outlining patrol of torpedo
boats found the water covered with
a light haze. There was no sea run
ning As the launches with the visit
ors on board turned toward the line
of battle cruisers against the horizon
they could see the "eyes" of the
fleet, in the form of a few prowling
destroyers which keep up incessant
watch, not only to protect their
mighty sisters from submarine attack
but to catch the first view of any
adventuresome German warship
which Wight poke Its nose Into the
open North sea.
Looming through the mist could be
seer the giant tripod masts which
identified the fleet as including tho
very latest type of battle cruisers,
and soon the launch was at the foot
of the boarding ladder of a huge" bat
tle cruiser which got its baptism of
fire at Helgoland Bight and later
bore an honorable share in the Dog
gerbank action
Visitors See Entire Ship.
Before lunch the visitors were per
mitted to enter any portion of the
ship they chose and those not too
heavy got through the trap door in
the top of a turret, the only entrance
left open in war time and occupied
themselves chiefly in watching the
youthful turret commander operate a
huge 13.5 inch gun with the same
ease that a man handles a sporting
rifle. From the time the charge and
the projectile leave the ammunition
hoist to the actual discharge of the
gun they watched tho operation
which makes the turret die most im
portant part of the fighting ship.
The party then lunched as guests
of tho divisional rear admiral who
was using the cruiser as his flagship,
then were taken on board the cruiser
Lion which was Admiral Beatty's
flagship in the Doggerbank battle.
With the exception of a dent in her
forward turret armor and a similar
scar just above the water line this
show vessel of the British navy dis
plays little sign of the terrific ham
mering she got when three German
battle cruisers concentrated their
lire on her.
Carefully mounted in the compan
ionway is an 11-inch unexploded shell
which the Seydlitz hurled through the
Lion's armor below the water line.
No evidence has ever been found
to justify the story that tho Lion was
torpedoed.
The shell which did the most dam
age did not penetrate the armor cas
ing of tho engine room, but dented In
so far that salt water got into a
broken feed pipe. This reduced her
speed from 27 to IS knots and forced
her to withdraw from the battle, In
which any vessel speeding less than
25 knots had no chance of keeping
the range of the fleeing Germans.
No sign was left of the 12-inch
shell which blew In the bulkhead of
the admiral's quarters after going
through the deck except the casing
and cap occupying the place of honor
among the Lion's trophies.
Even the captain's bath tub, which
was hurled overboard by the explo
sion of an eight-inch shell which prob
ably came from the Blucher, has
been replaced. Tho engine rooms of
the Lion showed no sign of tho ship
ever having been In battle.
Tho tripod masts with the control
bridge and the crowds nest had not
been subjected to a severe trial as
the secondary batteries of the Ger
man ships never had been within
range and the big guns devoted their
attention to the more vital parts of
the ship.
A torpedo boat picked up a portion
of the party from the Lion and the
remainder from the almost equally
celebrated Tiger which looked like
a newly commissioned ship, despito
the many times she Is reported to
have been sunk.
The oil burning torpedo boat tore
along tho impressive Hue of battle
cruisers in the battle formation in
which they expect to meet the Ger
man fleet.
Long Line of Cruisers.
Beyond the battle cruisers a long
line of light cruisers lost Itself in the
fog. Some of these vessels are vet
erans and show signs of tho rough
patrol work they are called upon con
stantly to do, but many are newly
commissioned and have yet to wear
the scars of service.
Speed, now the fetish of the navy,
reached the zenith with these light
cruisers. Any of them could easily
overhaul the fastest liner so far built.
Great Collier Flotilla.
Beyond the light cruisers was a
great flotilla of colliers constantly
feeding the hungry stokeholds, of the
battle cruisers, which even at anchor
keep up a full head of steam as
their turbines must be rested but nev
er allowed to grow cold.
Scattered about the fleet were sev
eral destroyer squadrons with light
cruiser leaders and merchant Bhips
as parents.
After sweeping around the destroy
ers the torpedo boat headed toward
a pre-dreadnought looking formidable
enough to the layman, but lightly re
ferred to by the officers accompany
ing the party as a third line unit or
bait to entice the German fleet Into
the North sea.
Fleet Personnel Remarkably Fit.
The personnel of the whole fleet
seemed to be remarkably fit and eag
erly interested in the work despite
tho uncomfortable conditions under
which their patrol work In the North
sea is done.
Tho battle cruiser Princess Royal
which was visited by the party, had
only two members of her crew in the
sick bay. Both of these men were
suffering from injuries caused by
football which is played with great
zest whenever a field is available.
The officers occasionally get some
golf but both men and officers must
depend upon their shipboard duties
for their chief means of exercise.
Raid News Rife.
Rumors of the possibility of Zeppe
lin raids on the fleet were rife and
the officers and crew still are mar
veling at the little harm done to the
vital parts by the rain of . heavy
shells In the naval action. The shell
which did the most damage did not
penetrate the armor casing of tho
englno room, but dented it In so far
that salt water got into a broken feed
pipe. This reduced the speed of the
Princess Royal from 27 to 18 knots
and forced the warship to withdraw.
The last glimpse the party caught
of the great fleet was an occasional
flash through tho darkening mist as
signals were exchanged between vari
ous divisions.

SWISS PEOPLE
ARE STIRRED UP
Discover That Federal Insur
ance Directorate Has Trans
ferred Funds Into Ger
man Stocks and Bonds.
Paris. Feb 11, 5.15 n. m A Geneva
dispatch to the Journal says that pub
lic opinion in Switzerland Is deeply
moved by the revelation that respon
sible officials of the federal insur
ance directorate transferred all the
federal insurance funds, with the ex
ception of six hundred thousand
francs, into German bonds and stocks
since the war began. This discovery,
the dispatch says, was made by the
board of auditors of the federal coun
cil during the periodical examination
of the insurance records.
The Swiss federal council in 1911
passed the federal Insurance law for
the purposes of which several million
francs were appropriated.
The Swls law alluded to was in two
parts, the first providing for Insur
ance against accident which involved
the establishment of an annual fund
of 8,000,000 -francs. Opposition was
made to the second part of the meas
ure on the ground that so large an
appropriation would endanger the na
tional treasury and that it was a
doubtful adventure for the state to
undertake a form of business which
had previously been regarded as tho
proper business in private companies.
Both parts of tho law were finally
adopted by 250,000 against 220,000 on
the referendum vote by the Swiss
people.

ENGLAND IN ON
WORLD PILLORY
Germans Claim British Method
of Warfare Is Treacherous
to Her Enemies.
Berlin, Feb. 11, via London, 2:20
p. m. The Germania, commenting on
the German government's announce
ment that It Intends to treat armed
merchantmen as warships, declares
that It places England in a pillory
before the world, and continues:
"The manner in which Eugland has
been unmasked by the publication of
tho German memorandum is more
striking than anything else hitherto
made known. The British method of
warfare has been exposed as dissimu
lating, as treacherous to her enemies
and to neutrals."
The Germania asserts the course
decided upon by Germany represents
her inescapable duty, which must lead
to a sharpening of naval warfare. Re
sponsibility for new developments, it
contends, will rest upon the British
government alone.

to allow her submarines to continue f
their piracy. The memorandum is a ij$
complaint against the perfectly legl- ',,
timate and long practiced right of our infj
merchantmen to carry guns for de- Bj
fense. Germany has thus raised nx
again the whole question of subma- (jit
rlne warfare, as affecting neutrals." jjjftj
The Express uses the headlines; wa
"Germany prepares world for new i
frightfulness."
The Daily Chronicle calls it. "Ger- Kl:
many's sink everything' policy." JJrS
"The Dally News, remarks in bold J J ' -
type across Its front page: Fit
"Immediately following the settle- jl jj
ment of her dispute with America on ml
the Lusitania, Germany has seized on ki
Ihe pretext for resuming her policy j
of submarine frightfulness."

CLEARS UP SITUATION
Abolishing Possibility of Pro-

Berlin, Feb. 11, via London, 4:40 j
p. m. The German government's de- jjj
cision to treat armed merchantmen jj . j)
of hostile countries as warships has jjl
been received with the heartiest ap- yXv
proval. The press of all parties ex- W i
presses the belief that neutrals will ,m
now be compelled to avoid all mer- tS '
chantmen of nations at war with Ger- jjpL
many and also to treat such vessels Jjjpjj
when in their harbors as warships
granting them only the usual right to Jjj;
a limited stay for taking on coal, etc H
Captain I, Persius says in tho Tage- liji
blatt that the copy of the British ad- jf
miralty instructions concerning the Mjf
operations against submarines will mi J
open the eyes of neutrals In regard Srli
to merchantmen armed "for defense 1H
only" and that neutrals will treat ji
them as warships The new proced- M'
urc, he says, will make the way easier j Jf
for" the submarine, although there is Ir
Still the possibility that Germany's Jl
enemies will fly false colors. w
The Kreuze Zeitung asserts the ffllj1
memorandum opens the way to a set- Bh
tlement of the Lusitania case and Wa
also abolishes the possibility of pro- ;
tecting hostile ships by placing m
Americans on board. jf
It refers to the flying of false col- M,
om and continues: qh
"America and other neutrals per- f
mlt this deceptive use of their colors. jjtf
No matter whether they cannot or IV
will not Btop it, they must bear the m
lesponsibility. If we are to treat all W
enemy merchantmen which are armed ml
as belligerents wo cannot stop be- -M
cause a neutral flag is used wrong- A
fully." K
