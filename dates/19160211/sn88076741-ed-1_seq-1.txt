A NON-PARTISAN LEAGUE?
There is in this state an organized
body of voters, said to be 30,000 in num
ber, wbo have each paid in the sum of
six dollars as a membership fee, which
organization goes by tbe name of the
"Non-Partiaan League." This body has
a board of directors and a presi
dent. The organization is political and
their expressed purpose is to hold cau
cuses and conventions and these con
ventions to select from such candidates
as may be nominated by the regular
parties and may seem to be the best in
the consideration and choice of these
non-partisan political conventions, and
uote for such selected candidates.
The platform planks of this new organ
ization might be condensed into the
statement, that bankers, railroads etc.,
are emenies to the farmers and that is
the duty and in the power of thefarmr-rs
to select and elect men to state and leg
islative positions that will take special
care of the interests of the farmers as a
class.
We suggest that the name of non-par
tisan" is in itself a misnomer.
The organization is self-evidently a
party and a political party. In fact it
has a far more complete organiz
ation and its purpos as a party more def
initely stated than has any other politi
cal party in tbe state.
Webster's dictionary defines a party—
"A number of persons united in opinion
or action as distinguished from or op
posed to tbe test of the community or
association. Especially one of tbe parts
into whioh a people is divided on opin
ions of questions of pnblio policy.''
Of course there is no law against any
number of citizens forming such an or*
'.gaaisation as that mentioned, but there
are laws whioh prevent persons who do
not belong to certain named or described
parties, from voting patty ballots at the
primaries.
Wo have not space to oopy all the pri
mary pravMoas In full but the ragula
tkmsaie to this effect.

elections are the democratic and re
publican parties, or any party that cast
5 per act of the vote at the preceding
election.
As the t'Non-Partisan League" did
not vote at all as an organisation at last
election it is clear that as such partisans,
members of the League cannot cast a
republican or democratic or that of any
other party that cast 5 per cent of the
vote at last election. Neither can they
truthfully register with the assessor as
required by law, as a republican, demo
crat. socailist, or prohibitionist.
When a voter wbo has joined the
'Non-Partisan League" and thereby re
pudiated at least a part of the candid
ates in be nominated by any party, at
tempts to vote at the primaries, in the
words of the statute. "The judges and
inspector of election when handing a
ballot to an elector shall inform him
that must vote f.ir the candidates of the
political partv such ballot represents
only and tbe voter shall call for the bal
lot representing the party or principle
with which he affiliates and shall receive
such ballot and no other/'

We do not know much about the met
hods practised at Annapolis, but we do
know something about school teaching,
and we make the assertion that in any
school wbe.her it be a university, a col
lege, a high school or a little country
district school, when one fourth of tbe
pupils fail, that the conclusion is inevit
able that the failure is due to the teach
ers.
It would be a very extraordinary mat
ter for any such wholesale failure of
pupils in any of the ordinary high schools
of .learning it is therefore all the more
extraordinary to hear this of such a
picked body as the students at the Na
val Academy. A large proportion of
them are selected by competitive ex
aminations, and the examination for
entrance is said to be difficult. Each
one admitted not only has to stand a
mental examination but must also be
physically perfect. Hence, such physi
cally and mental strength ought to be
more successful in their tasks than tbe
ordinary run of students.
We have the Secretary of War as
authority for the statement that just
now what the army needs most is train
ed officers and we suppose this is equally
true of the navy.
"The mills of the gods grind slowly
but they grind exceedingly tine." Pos
sibly, our two military and naval mills
in the attempt to grind out exceedingly
fine officers are grinding rather too slow
ly. If tbe meal were a bit coarser and
the quantity greater it might better fill
the vital needs of the bodies of the army
and navy.
The Mannheim Insurance Company
of Germany, pursuant to His Majesty's
proclamation, has been granted no re
newal of its license to carry on an inaur
ance business in the Province of Mani
toba, and the deposit, amounting to
910,605.04, in the hands of the provincial
treasurer, is being retained. He recom
mend that this deposit be confiscated.

Ftom tbe daily papers of.last week we
learn tbat one fourth of the cadets at
Annapolis Naval school which supplies
officers for the U. S. Navy, failed in their
examinations and will be asked to go
home unless the Secretary of tbe navy
interferes turi uives them another trial.

THE INSTITUTE.
We are'handicapped sombwhat in not
being able to give a fuller accountof the
prooeediogs at tbe Institute meeting
Wednesday as it occurred so near tbe
our day of publication.
Tbe hall was completely filled yester
day afternoon by farmers and citizens
and their wives, eons and daughters.
Tbe day was one of the finest we have
bad lately and therefore favorable to a
good attendance. A good number came
over from St. Vincent and that locality.
The morning session was given over to
informal talks and getting ready for
afternoon. In the afternoon Professor
Larson talked about silos and ensilage.
He is very favorable to.the silo and gave
many facte from bis own experience.
He spoke of several different forms of
construction all of which were good.
He said that for our kind of corn fodder
that it takes one year with another about
-thirty acres of corn to fill a 32 foot silo.
That !Q|Hfige is fine feed for all kinds
of stock W t1iie firib including
chickens. Tbat rii)|^wrn ha* far more
value than green isttrd. and makes the
sweeter ensilage. Ensilage properly
made will keep good indefinitely.
Mr. Delancy of Valley City then
spoke on horses in a very interesting
manner. He said the sire should be a
large horse, not merely heavy. Fait is
of no value, though our farmers have
spent thousands of dollars for surplus
fat on horses. It will not do to mix
the breeds. Each breed has its faults,
but the mixture only, perpetuates the
faults. Percberons and Ciydes do not
mix w?U. The raising of good colts on
a farm may do a lot helping to keep
tbe boy on the farui
Miss Ida Ratzlaff of Valley City, then
talked along the lines of woman's labor
on the farm. She spoke of tbe supply
of water both hard and sott, that it
should be plenty and convenient, and
pointed out tbe value of water for cook
ing, bath and toiletconveniences telling
of methods of installing cisterns, tanks
etc.
At 'be evening program the hall was
again filled to its full capneity. A very
large number of the visitors having re
mained over.
Prof. W. R. Porter gave and interest,
ing talk on alfalfa and according to his
ideas we have a better soil for alfalfa
than in [the western part of the state.
One observation is of particular value
—that all alfalfa being a small seed
needs a very firm seed bed and that it
should not be covered over a half inch.
Mr. Delancy then gave an interesting
talk about farm life in Scotland and
France in tbe localities where they breed
fine horses and cattle. His observation
waB that these particular communities
owed their great prosperity to the feet
tbat they had as a locality, given their
united attention to the breeding and
raising of finer stock and in this way had
made a name for tbe stock all over the
world.
Miss Hatzlaff then gave a demonbtra
tion of tbe proper manner of canning
meats, vegetables, and twite, ftie atat*
