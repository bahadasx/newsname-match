Washington, Feb. 10. flcpnblicuns
of the house iiiilitnry committee as
sured President Wilson today thnt a
strong- army increase bill, drafted in
a tion-purti.HUii spirit, and ttr.'ciiinpli.sti
f iiMT all the tiiHiu objects sought by
tin- war department plan, would bp
on the house calendar within three
weeks at most. They t'dd him, how
ever, tint the committee practically
was unanimously opposed to the de
partment's continental army scheme.
Headed by Pepresentat.ive Kahn, of
California, ranking minority member
of the committee, the republicans
called at the White House at the
president's invitation, following Chair,
man Hay and several of his demo
cratic colleagues who had carried the
wimp message to the chief executive
yesterday.
Friendly Kxohango of Vitus.
Today's conference was later de
scribed as a friendly exchange of
views. The only difference of opinion
was on the tiucslion of the continen
tal army proposed by Secretary fiar
rison as tt substitute for the national
guaid ill the first line of defense . :
The president was informed that!
w hile the committee opposed the sec- j
rrtury's idea, a scheme was in pro- j
cess ot formulation by winch ine
members of the national guard
could be welded into an effective in
strument of national defense and
brought, up to the strength believed
necessai v by military experts.
Wants I'll mil it Action.
Mr. "Wi'so-n stated ins own prefer- ;
civ tor the continental plan. He
made no effort, however, the White:
House visitors said later, to sway j
tli'em In their opinions beyond stat-
ing h'H oWn belief, based on that of!
his military advisers, that the state j
troops would not serve national needs j
us efficiently as. the proposed purely;
federal force would do. The only
urgency in the president's remarks, j
it was staled, was his plea for tiuiek i
congressional action to put the coun- i
try In a state of adequate defense,
bused on a sound military policy, and i
bis desire that party politics be not'
allowed to cloud what he considered
a vital national issue. He found
hearers in heartv accord with him
In both desires.
Why liii I !' Is Wanted.
The president is understood to have
outlined the underlying military rea
sons on which war department offi
cials have based their request for a
force of -11.111,11(111 men in addition to
the regulars, always under complete
federal control. The general t-taff of
the army has defined the abiding1
policies, of the n'ltion as being the
avoidance of entangling; alliances and
the maintenance of the Monroe doc
trine now broadened hy Mr.
1 'a n - A n icrlcji n d ecla.rn tion .
lenses except as lo personnel, nor over
the plan to amass a huge amount of
war supplies during; the next four
years to lie maintained as a reserve.
The fortifications committee bus been
at work in secret sessions on these
proposals for man weeks and is neur-
iug completion of its bill.
Industrial .Mobilization.
President Wilson discussed briefly
Willi his visitors the need of prepara
tion for an industrial mobilization of
civilian forces to secure the army's
supply lines and also private resources
for the production of war material and
army supplies, liotlr the army and
navy departments are at work now on i
investigations to show just what can
be expected in this way in lime of
war.
I i rtf r iL M .-M-creiary nannis, oi ine navy,
vised by Officers of the Na- sneaking before the n,ue,i states
i numiicr ol commerce session today,
.said :
j "Within a few weeks the civilian ad
Ivlsory board of the navy xvill be able
to tell us what c-ery factory in Amer
ica can make and lioxv much of it, If
the nation should have a sudden tall
to arms."
Admiral ltlue Continues.
llcfore the housp naval committee,
Kear Admiral Mine, chief of the navi
gation bureau of the navy, and Cap
tain Kassctt, head of the naval mili
tia division, unfolded departmental
plans for building- up and maintain
ing an adequate reserve force for
the navy which will include members
of the merchant marine, officers and
men, in its personnel under an elab
orate scheme that lias been devised.
An untiled bill dealing with the
whole subject will le worked out by
tile committee later.
As a direct step toward prepared
ness. Captain Passett disclosed that
the department is arranging for the
.first mobilization of the present naval
reserve that has ever been attempted.
More than ball' of the-present force of
'8,1100 men will be given two Weeks of
active .service at the fleets next sum
