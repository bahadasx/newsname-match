THE STIEFF PIANO SELLS WELL
The Graham Daily News had the fol
lowing in last Tuesdays issue:
"W. K. Graves, the well known
piano salesman, recently won two
prizes for selling more pianos than
any other salesman in the contest.
He got $50 as the premium. Mr.
Graves rarely falls to convince them
that music will be sweet to their
ear when he goes after a sale. He
is agent for the Stieff Piano Co."
Mr. Graves is evidently a good
salesman, but to sell the Stielf piano
to a party who wants an instrument
of real value and merit, is not such
a difficult task after all. Few if any
makers of pianos in the United States
are better known or stand higher
than the Stieff. This fine instrument
is advertised in the Clinch Valley
News, and has been for years. Read
the ad and write the company if
yon are thinking of buying a piano.

Till-: SAINT (AM) SI NN UUS) OF
NOlt'iTI TAZKWKLL.
I worshipped with the saints (and
sinners) of North Tazowoll, on Sun?
day morning during the revival which
lias just closed, and intciulod these
"few remarks" for Ihe last issue of
the paper, but upon returning home
from services I was siezed by the
grip, and up (o Ibis good hour have
foil in no very suitable mood for
writing, not CVCII about revivals. 1
don't wish to be understood as even
insinuating for a moment that
tllCt'C was any connect ion between the
services at N< rth Tazowoll here
referred to and my attack of the
grip, or more correctly speaking, tho
grip's attack of me. Most surely
1 didn't attack it. I wouldn't have
pestered if 1 bad met it in the road
but would have sidled off and pass?
ed by on the oilier side.
Bui the monstor slipped up un?
awares, mid struck me a solar plex?
us when I wits east oxpoiliuu an
attack?immediately upon return?
ing from a good warm rovlvr.I meet?
ing. But, about the insoMng: 1 al?
ways onjoy "goiu' to meotlu'" at
Nqrlii Tazev/oll, The folk.: there el
ways seem glad lo see me, and shake
bands, and give me cordial invita?
tion to ?Lauer, and of c< ill':..', tin y
treat every visitcr in the mine hourly
manner. Some churches remind one
of a great big cold storage room like
they nave over at the Packing House
across the river. There is a stiffness
and coldness in the atmosphere, from
the pulpit and choir all the way down
amen corner and all, which chills you.
tin this oceassion the atmosphere
was anything else than chilling.
The pastor, Bov. Mr. Platt, bad
been holding it series of meetings ful?
some time, Rev. W. C. Thompson
doing the preaching, and tin: meeting
was in full swing. The singing was
good?just a little draggy, perhaps,
lacking a little snap and life, but it
was good. When 1 went in they were
singing that fine suggestive old song,
"I want to go There." The sentiment
is line, but 1 noticed that some of the
brefbern who joined in wer.- not very
enthusiastic.
"1 heard a good man say once that
he always felt like singing tho re?
frain this way: 1 want to go there
I do, but I don't want to go just now."
I heard a preacher say once that be
believed there was a great deal of
lying done in singing. There are
some hynms that freeze?others burn
on the lip., flint attempt to utter them
But, I am wandering away. Rev. Mr.
Thompson, as we all know, is the
circuit rider on this Tazowoll circuit.
I believe they cnll the Methodist
preacher "circuit rider" yet, though
1 am not sure. That's what they
used lo bo, but I seldom hear the
designation these days.
They now say, I believe, "preacher
in charge of such and such circuit,
at any rate, Mr. Thompson has charge
of this Tazowoll circuit, embracing
churches in Burkes Garden, on Clinch,
in Thompson Valley anil in the Cove
He is an industrious, hard working
man and his work is telling. The
meeting at North Tazowoll resulted
I believe in about 80 or r.i re pro?
fessions. Last Sunday night some 10
odd jo;:ie<I the church. Several of
the older members said it was the
best meeting they kr.d had for .'(()
years.
Mr. Thompson's preaching is clear,
interesting and convincing. He speaks
with an earnestness that holds the
attention and forces conviction. Ho
doesn't claim, I believe, to be a
"professional" evangelist, yet be has
decided evangelistic gifts. His meet?
ing at North Tazowoll was devoid of
anything of the spectacular of sen?
sational.
On this particular occasion there
wore a number of the leading citizens,
heads of families, of the community,
who declared themselves for the bet?
ter and higher life.
I will not attempl to describe or re?
port the sermon. The subject was,
"Material and Worldly Things Cnn
Never Satisfy the Needs of The Soul."
Solomon, who had everything on
earth that he could think of, that mo?
ney would buy and power command
from the smallest wish to the highest
call of ambition and power, said at
last "Vanity and Vexation of Spirit."
And still there are some living now]
who are tools enough to think that
if they could have riches thoy could
bo satisfied.
'yiey might bo, but aot because of
mniurall possession. As mi expres?
sion of their appreei.ition I am
informed that the North Tazewell
people made up u purse of over $2tll)
for .Mr. Thompson and n nice suit
of clothes for Mr. l'lalt.
REVIVAL AT NORTH TA/KWE1.L
The revival at North Tazewell clos?
ed last, Sunday night. It had been in
progress four weeks. The first week
prayer meetings wore hold every
night at the church led by the pastor,
Rev. Ohas. R. brown and Mr. F. 11.
Korbes. The next three weeks, Rev.
W. I'. Thompson pronehed twice daily.
I'ho mcotinga roaulled in more than
one hundred conversions r.nd reclam?
ations and an addition to the Math
...Ii:-, church of forty-two members
besides some who joined other
churches. According I" well informed
opinion this was tho Ik-si meeting
Hi community has seen for many
years, the genuine i oikI accomplish?
ed can not bo slated in figures, The
house wo:; Idled to its capacity near?
ly every night, and tho morning ser?
vices were largely attended. Kor a
part of the time meetings were held
in the K. of I'. hall for men in the
church for women and proved to be
very helpful. The meeting was deep
in spiritual power and all those who
came forward to the alter seemed
deeply convinced of sin mid to express
a determined desire to lead differ?
ent lives. I may say personally that
it was the best, revival I have ever
attended. Till power of God seemed
lo be present at i very BOI'Vico from
the begiiiiug and the meeting pro
grossed mid ended without the slight?
est friction or criticism so far as is
known. There is every reason to be
Hove that (he comunity was lilted to

The people of North Til Z0 WO 11 prov?
ed their geilUinuHH of their famed bos
pilality and Brother Thompson and 1
fared siimpl ioiisly every day and
nicht. The opinion often voiced by
others is heartily endorsed by him as
well as myself, that no nunc cordial

found any where. Lust Sunday morn?
ing an olTuring was taken for llrothor
Thompson by llrothor Brown in his
inimitable manner ami it was hand?

suit of clothes WllH also provided
for the pastor; "a thing of beauty

We were glad to have lb,- presence
ami help of other pastors of Tazewell
and members of othor churches.
Brother Thompson deserve ; the ox
alted opinion of the people and pat Uir.
lie was almost a si l anger to us ex?
cept, by reputation but now we all fool
that we all know him ami we love
him for wdiat. he is and what he d.I,
We consider OUI'SulvoH very for?
tunate in securing the services of a
man of such exceptional ability as a
preacher and evangelist, and con?
gratulate the pcop.e of TuKOWoll cir?
cuit on having him as their pastor.
We bid him God-spoed ami wish him
well and are confident thai, the suc?
cess which has always attended his
ministry will increase and become
even more powerful.

RUSTLE AM) STIR.
This is a day of grant bustle and
stir in nil places at all limes, in all
departments and along nil lines. All
people are busy in some way. This
age is becoming more ami more a day
of specialist, the day for jack-of-all
Lrades is rapidly passing if not al?
ready gone.
"Every man to his trade" is a com?
mon saying, but is interesting and
sometimes amusing and often di.i
gustillg to hear the common tall;
around stations, stores, barber shops
and other places of gathering.
While we frankly and gladly ad?
mit that many of the beat men and
women of the land come lo these
places mid often do or say many
things that are noble and uplifting.
There are others. Every man feels
forced to say what, he thinks in re?
gard lo the bible, religion and the
church, and a man never gels too
wicked or ignorant or too drunk to
rattle ofT his biblical knowledge, his
religion conviction ,and his judge?
ment and criticism of the church, be?
ginning with preacher and ending
with the worst hypocrite in town.
The world has many experts and
specialists In religion und theology,
but many of them have a very imper?
fect standard. They measure! them?
selves by the hypocrite then boast?
"I am as good as he."
Both the hypocrite and ho who
measures himself by that standard
and finds himself just us good, need
to take a few doses of "God's Word,"
in a half glass of "genuine honesty"
before retiring, and follow with a
dose of self-examination and repent?
ance.
And the world could profit by their
example more than their precepts.

loafing ON TUB street
ai ri:u school nouns.
'The nttoution of Ibis paper has
been directed lo what a citizen calls
"a bad habit that should bo slopped."
lie refers to boys loafing on tho
streets after school hours instead
of going home und trying lo iiinko
themselves useful ubout tbu house.
It is not an uncommon thing lo sou
boys of almost nil ages and sizes,
going home anywhere from live to
six o'eloek in tllO afternoon.
They loaf, loan against brick walls,
loafing ill stop's, or BCUlllO oil the
sidewalks from 8i!IO until dnik drives
(hem home. Tills is a habit which
in pernicious in the olfoct, and should
bo stopped. Wholhor Prof. Qollolion
bus jurisdiction llftor school hours or
not is a question. It appears that
something should be done In many
instances these boys are needed lit
homo, Their mothers and sisters are
carrying coal, splitting the kindling
Wood und doing oilier OUtsido chorea
which those boys should do. At leasl
Lhoy should be pulling in their time
nl something more useful than loaf?
ing on I bo si reel s.
In nearly nil cases tliono boya won't
obey i heir mothers. Tlioy pay little
or no b.I lo what (hey uro bidden
io do, ami somebody should bo om
pomori d, if parents cunt manage their
own children somebody should bo
delegated to tho lank. All of us liava
seen boys, and men loo, loafing on
the streets, and mother ami daughter
driving cows, lugging tho weeks
wa hing home, spilling wood and do?
ing other work which thoSO idlers
should be doing. The school author?
ities may ho able lo say something,
or perhaps tho mayor and town Sor
gcillll may 1)0 able lo do something to
remedy an evil habit amongst us.
