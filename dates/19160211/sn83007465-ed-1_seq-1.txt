Prohibition measures were
further entrenched in South
Carolina Wednesday when the
senate by a vote of 26 to 18 reduced
the amount of liquors
that may be imported each
^ month from one gallon to two
quarts. Earlier in the morning
an amendment to limit monthly
shipments to one quart was rejected
by a vote of 21 to 23. Several
other amendments were offered,
among these being two
to allow the alternative of beer
shipments. One by Senator
Hughes of Union would provide
for 60 bottles or one-half
barrel of beer monthly. Senator
Sinkler of Charleston offered in
substitute an amendment to provide
for 30 bottles of beer. Vote
was not taken on the alternative
amendments during the morning
session.
in the evening session the
bill whs further modi fieri by tin
adoption of the Hughes amendment,
which provided for month
ly shipments of GO nint bottles
of beer lieu of the 2 quarts
of whiskey. The amendment was
adopted by a vote of 22 to 10
The Hughes amendment was
further modified to preclude
shipments of beer with a content
of alcohol greater than 5 pei
cent. Provision was also made te
have beer shipped in open cases
that rigid inspection might be
enforcerl. The bill in its entirety
was passed bv a vote of 28 tr
12.
Each sorctav fp his sea<
yesterday morning, and a com
nlete vote was polled on the tw<
amendments, calling for decisive

Senator Banks argued that nd
option of the amendment woulc
run counter to the exnressc
wish of the peonle. who had fa
vored prohibition, contingent ut>
on extension of the cahon month
law. Senior Carlisle empha
sized that the referendum re
ferred particularly to manu
facture and sale only, without
sentence, without the fine alter
relation to importation.
Senator Black of Bamberg bo
lieved the reduction of tht
amount would aid materially ii
eliminating blind tigers. StocV
for illicit selling, he said, coulr
be easily supplied when three
or four would pool their monthly
shipments.
Senator Kitchin argued foi
the retention of the law withoul
modification. Shipments could
be received from each express
office in the county, and reducing
the amount, he said, would onl.v
necessitate an increase in the
number of offices to which the
purchaser would have package
shipped.
Senator Brice argued for
the passage of the amendment,
expressing the belief that the
-reduction of the amount to one
quart would be mere effective in
ridding the State of illicit liquot
dealers than would the Liles bill,
which proposes imprisonment
sentence, without the fine alterv
native.
^ Senator Alan Jonstone, Sr.,
of Newberry characterized the
Sinkler amendment as a "dangerous
bill." Express packages,

out, could not be broken, and
