The western front still is the central

the intensity of the violent struggle
In the vicinity of Vimy and Neuvllle,
near the Belgian border,, while far
ther south along the line there are
signs of activity on the part of both
the Germans and French.
In Belgium, according to unofficial
reports, there has been a notable ar
tillery battle in progress during the
last ten days, near Ypres, but opinion
appears to prevail among military ob
servers that the Germans have decid
ed to postpone their predicted offen
sive until more favorable weather pre
vails. They are reported busy
strengthening their lines.
In Russia, the artillery play on the
Riga-Dvinsk front is notably heavy
in character, but the infantry does
mt appear to have been active.
In Volsynia, the Russians report a
forward movement in the capture of
a hill between the fortresses of Rovno

YOUNG UDS
Three Boys, Oldest 10 Years
of Age, Steal Pocketbook
With $75.
SAY THEY'RE SPORTS
—REFUSE CHANGE
Checks Hidden Under Edge
of Coal Shed Near North
ern Pacific Bridge.
One of the most daring robberies
committed in East Grand Forks for
many years was staged this morning,
shortly aftsr 9 o'clock, by three boys,
afed 8, 9 and 10, of this city.
The three young lads, Boyd Sc.
George, aged 9 Diamond Moen, pgod
10, and Orvllle Moen, aged 8, entered
the Parness confectionery store about
9 o'clock and engaged in conversation
with Mrs. William Parness, proprie
tor of the store.
A short time later Mrs. Parness
found It necessary to use the tele
phone for a short time, and turned
her back to the three boys. While
she used the phone, one of the boys
went behind a counter, opened a
drawer, and took out a pocketbook
containing $75, which had been kept
cn hand to make change.
The boys then said they were going
out t.o bring in some -wood for Mrs.
Parness. and immediately left the
place. She, however, knew that no
wood had been kept outside and be
came suspicious. She thought noth
ing more of the matter, however, un
ti! some time later, when she looked
for her pocketbook and found it miss
ing.
Hhe Immediately notified the East
Grand Forks police department, and
a search was made for the young lads.
The three boys, in the meantime, had
gone to the Northern Pacific railway
bridge, where they counted the mon
ey. $50 of which was in cash. The
rest, liich was in checks of small de
nominations, they hid under the edge
of a coal shed near the railroad bridge

Real Sports.
They then crossed the bridge and
went directly to a Grand Forks dry
goods ctore, and each one picked out
a pair of mittens for himself. The to
tal amount of the purchase was only
a trifle over a dollar, and they hand
ed the clerk a 6 bill in payment. When
tho clerk started to make change tor
the bill, ort&jof the boys spoke up:
"Keep the chfcng*—"fce're shorts—
we've got lots of moM," at the same
time, taking a wad of bills from his
pocket.
The clerk -became suspicious and In
vited the lads itato another depart
ment to sell them some "tossel caps."
IrKttad however, he escorted them
into the office and called the propri
etor ot' the establishment, who noti
fied the Grand Forks police depart
ment.
The East Grand Forks department
was notified and Chief Albert Hurst
made a hurried trip to thiB side and
arrested the boys.
The lads have been released from
custody on parole, and if their good
behavior warrants it, they will be al
lowed to remain free.

"I will not discuss my resignation

EVENING
EDITION
The circumstances which led up to
the resignation are detailed in the
secretary's correspondence with the
president which was made public
last night by the white house. The
president, the letters disclose, believes
that the training, organization and
control of a military reserve should
be under immediate federal direction,
but is not "irrevocably or dogmatical
ly committed to any one plan." He
wrote Mr. Garrison that he could not.
force any specific plan on congress'
and added: "I must welcome a frank
interchange of views, and a patient
and thorough comparison of all the
methods proposed for obtaining the
objects we all have in view."
Mr. Garrison's contentions that only
the plans of the war department
could be considered seemed to the
president "wholly unjustifiable." Mr.
Garrison considered "reliance upon
the militia for national defense an
unjustifiable and Imperiling of the
Mr. Garrison characterized the
Clarke amendment to the Philippine
bill providing conditionally for the
independence of the islands within
four years "an abandonment of the
duty of this nation and a breach of
trust for the Filipinos." The presi
dent replied it was his judgment that
the Clarke amendment "was unwise at
this time," but added "it would clear
ly be most inadvisable for me to take
the position that I must dissent from
that action should both houses of con
gress concur in a bill embodying that
amendment."
He said he must withhold judgment
until the final action was before him
in definite form.
On January 12 Secretary Garrison
wrote the president "we are facing a
critical juncture with respect to the
military part of the national defense
program," and declared he felt that
"unless the situation is dealt with
promptly and effectively, we can in
dulge in no reasonable expectation of
any acceptable result."
He insisted that there could be no
substantial solution which did not
result in national forces under the
exclusive control and authority of the
national goverment. Admitting that
there could be legitimate discussion
over the means of obtaining these
national forces, the secretary asserted
that from the beginning of the gov
ernment, the acknewledged weakness
of the situation arose out of the lack
of any system producing federal
forces.
"The situation was rendered worse"
he added, "by the presence of state
troops, raised, officered, trained and
governed by the states."
There is a distinct line of cleavage.
Mr. Garrison held, between reliance
upon a system of state troops and
reliance upon national forces. "Upon
this subject," he said in his letter to
the president, "there does not exist,
and there cannot legitimately exist
any difference of opinion among those
who are unbiased and we believe In
real national security and defense."
