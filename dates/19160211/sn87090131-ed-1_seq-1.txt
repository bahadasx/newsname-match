SAM WAS DISCOURAGED. j WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
(Lopyright, 091s. by tae MicL.
SAM WAS DISCOURAGED.
"'What's the matter, Sam?" asked
his friend WilL
"I'm discouraged,' replied Sam. "I
haven't been late for ' year, and I've
worked hard; but the boss doesn't
seem to appreciate me. Only yester
day he raised the pay of a fellow who
hasn't been there half as long as I
have."
"Kind of tough, I admit," replied
Will, consolingly. "How did it hap
pen? You say the other fellow got
his pay raised. There must be a rea
son for it"
"The only reason I can think of is
partiality. The boss always liked him
and just pushed him ahead."
"Let's talk it over," said Will. "Per
haps the boss was partial, but was
this partiality due to what the fel
low did? Think hard."
'-Not much," snapped Sam. "Wal
ter has always been fresh, putting
himself in the boss' way, and get
ting him to notice him, while I've
minded my business."
"Let's be fair, Sam," said his friend.
"Ycu say that Walter has made his
boss notice him. What has he done?"
"Well," replied Sam. "he's all the
time doing a lot of things that he
hasn't any business to do, things
which he isn't paid for doing."
"Such as what?"
"Well, he fixes up the boss' desk.
sees that the inkstand is filled, puts
on a new piece of blotting paper
once in a while, arranges the letters.
and a lot of other things which no
body asks him to do."
"Sam," said Will quietly, "you've hit
it. You've minded your own busi
ness, while Walter has done the same
thing and more. You're getting all
you are worth for what you're doing.
Walter hasn't neglected his regular
duties, has he?"
"No," snapped Sam.
"Now, you see, old boy, that Wal
ter has minded his own business as
well as you have. He hasn't neglect
i ed anything which he should do, but
he has gone beyond that and done a
lot of little things which the boss
particularly appreciates."
"How is a fellow going to do more
than his regular work when he is busy
all the time?"
"Isn't Walter busy all the time,
too? But he found a way, and so
can you, Sam, if you want to. Walter
has been interested. He has felt his
responsibility. You've not been par
ticularly interested, and you've not
realized your responsibility. You've
let well enough alone. Walter has
gone farther. My boss lectured as
the other day, and told us how he
became a member of the house be
cause he felt just as though he were
the firm himself, when he was get
ting five dollars a week; and he
Jooked out for the firm's interest
as well as he would have done if he
had owned it. I tell you, Sam, the
fellow who gets anywhere nowadays
has got to get out of the rut Stick
ing to your duties isn't enough. The
boss expects you to do that, but he
raises the pay of the man who does
what he doesn't have to do. provided.
of course, that he performs his regu
lar duties satisfactorily."
Was Sam convinced? I think not,
for at the end of the year he was
out of a job, and his friend-well, he
isn't a partner yet, and perhaps he
never will be. but he is the head of
a large department. He did what he
didn't have to do and "got there."
Slightly Different.
SSome little time ago a benevolent
lady read in the papers a paragraph
to the effect that, in an effort to save
his cat from being crushed by the
wheels of a passing omnibus, a small
boy had been knocked down and seri
ously injured by the vehicle, and had
been obliged to be taken to a London
hospital.
The lady. who kept cats herself,
greatly admired the boy's devotion to
the "poor dumb animal," and wrote
to the hospital, inclosing a handseme
sum "for the brave and humane suf
ferer."
By return of post came a letter from
the matron acknowledging the receipt
of the money, but alas! explaining
that the cat which had been the cause
of all the woe was an even dumber
thing that the lady had imagined it
was, in fact. that somewhat dangerous
toy, a tipcat.
True Sport.
"The manager of my store," declared
the merchant to a little coterie of
friends, "tis a peculiar genius. Why,
would you believe it, when he draws
his weekly salary he keeps out only
one dollar for spending money and
sends the rest to his wife in Indian
apollis!"
His listeners-with one exception,
who sat silent and reflective-gave
vent to loud murmurs of wonder and
admiratiJon.
"Now, it may sound thin." added
the speaker, but it is true, neverthe
less."
"Ok, 1 do't doubt tt at all!"
quickly rejotned the quiet one; "I was
oly woandering what he does with the
dollar"
WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
"I'1 never trade at Blank's any
more," exclaimed a friend.
"Why?"
"Look at this tult" he replied. "It's
all out of shalpe; -sf hbbi'f, Idt it
doesn't fit me."
"How long have you had it"
"Six months."
"Ever had it sponged and pressed?"
"No!"
"What did you pay for it?"
"Sixteen dollars, I think."
"John," I said soberly. "When you
buy a $16 suit at Blank's or anywhere
else, you may get $16 worth of cloth,
wear, style, and fit, and you don't get
any more. You've had the suit six
months, and no suit at any price looks
well if it isn't pressed as often as
once a month. I know Blank, and he
is about as honest as anybody else in
the business. He makes a specialty
of low-priced clothes, and he gives you
your money's worth."
But John went away disgruntled.
He had purchased a cheap suit, and
expected it to wear as well, and to
look as well. as one for double or
more the price.
You can't get more than you pay
for except by accident, and accidents
are not to be depended upon.
There is a restaurant not far from
my office, where they serve whole
some food at reasonable prices. The
food is good, but '"e servi is - ^r;
there are no finger -owls, and the
napkins are small; but everything is
scrupulously clean. The restaurant
gives you what you pay for, yet many
of the boarders are continually kick
ing. They expect the same quality
of food, and the same service, for
40 cents that they would receive if
they paid $1 or $1.50. The restaurant
serves a good 40-cent dinner. It is
worth all you pay for it. and no more.
On the train the other day 1 over
heard a stranger condemning the man
who sold him a watch. In the course
of the conversation It leaked out that
he had paid $10 for the timepiece and
didn't like it because it didn't run as
well as his brother's $50 watch.
The 10-cent moving picture house,
with vaudeville between the films,
isn't likely to give you as good an
acting show as you will receive where
the prices run from 50 cents to $1,
yet half of the audiences compare the
acts with those of higher priced
houses.
If'you don't get what you pay for,
kick and kick hard. If you get what
you pay for, no matter what it is,
keep your mouth shut.
The kicker is one of the pushers of
progress, provided he kicks at things
which should be kicked at,
Criticism is all right when you have
something to criticize, but this ever
lasting kicking and criticism, when
you are receiving all that you have
paid for, injures you and everybody
with whom you come in contact.
Take the weather, for example. It
doesn't seem to suit more than a
small portion of the people, and the
majority i re finding fault with it. I
have a s *';picion that kicking against
the weather doesn't change it. If it
did, I'd raise a fund for the establish
ment of a weather-kicking bureau.
When it rains, let it rain. Don't
try to stop it. Buy an umbrella, a
raincoat, and a pair of rubbers.
THE FARMER AS CONSUMER
Agriculturist Noted as a Good All
Around Customer of the Hard
ware Dealer.
The farmer is the greatest and most
universal consumer of goods in the
hardware line of any class in this
country. Not only does he use every
form of farming implement, but he
has likewise usually a complete as
sortment of carpenter's and mechan
Ic's tools.
He is by fur the best customer of
the hardware dealer in household and
kitehen utensils, and in these days of
sanitation has become a large user of
bathroom fixtures and plumbing sun
t dries He is the great cobbler of the
Sday. being a steady absorber of shoe
Ssoles. shoe nails, shoe hammers, shoe
Slasts, and rubber heels. He is about
the principal consumer now left in
Sthe harness and saddlery line, and
likewise buys heavily of automobile
and bicycle sundries. Of late he has
become a large user of electric light
fixtures and of telephone appliances
Besides that he is a liberal spender
in the way of pocket knives and cut
lery in general. Also he is the best
buyer of stores and stove flxings
known to the trade. :le is of more
value to the hardware dealer as an all
around customer than a dozen city
men livring in steamheated fiats and
Sapartments
Good Taste.
SPatience-It is said that rats are
- not only very cunning, but display
good taste.
SPatrice-i guess that's so. All the
a pictures I have seen o girl. being
e frightesed by mloe were good-looking
girls.
