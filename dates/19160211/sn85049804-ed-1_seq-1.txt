THE BIRTH OF A NATION.
We have been asked so often by
our white friends as to what is the
play called "The Birth of a Nation"
that so m&ny people are protesting
against its production here and else
where and perchance some of our
colored people many not know what
this play is based upon, I shall en-
Mrs. Daisy Atkins of Kansas City,
Ho., and sister Mrs. Mable Coleman of
Rock Island, 111., were called here this
week on account of the death of their deavor to enlighten all seeking more
light as to this immoral, race hatred
play, based upon Thomas Dixon's
book entitled "The Clansman,"
dramatized and pliotoized. We are
surprised that so many pretended in
telligent white people are so eager
to have this inferior picture played
which causes so much prejudice,
quarrels and friction between the
races, inflaming each with hatred
toward the other.
The play was written by Thomas
Dixon, author of "Leopard Spots"
and "The Clansman," and whose pur
pose is to degrade the Negro and the
Union soldier and boost the "lost
cause" of the rebels and portray to
the American people that Jeff Davis
and his gang were right. The Ku
Klux Klan, organized just after the
war in the southern states, was for
the purpose of overriding the emanci
pation of the Negro and the defeat of
the rebel army. Colored men were
suppressed and murdered by the Ku
Klux Klan because they wouldn't
bow to the indignities imposed upon
the ex-«laves. If. Mr. Dixon and his
crowd want to be fair about portray
ing the,"birth of a nation," they
should start Vut 'wltli^%Si?^la*rti'JCftFt
coin emancipating a race, thereby
making a new nation on this conti
nent, cementing the North and the
South and eradicating- slavery, and
thus display the rise of the colored
man as well as the rebel soldier who
held the slaves in bondage for years.
Both factions have improved wonder
fully since the war, and a picture of
this kind would have been appropri
ate. Instead of portraying the black
soldier trying to outrage a young
white girl, he could have pictured the
slaved protecting the wives and
families of the rebels when the lat
ter were fighting to keep them slaves.
Tnstead of portraying the colored
lieutenant governor trying to force a
white woman to marry him, he could
have pictured the thousands of slave
holders who were living in open
adultery and raising families by col
ored women. This shown upon the
screen would probably have had a
different effect upon the American
white man.
There never was a redeeming
feature about the whole disgraceful
Ku-Klux Klan system. In fact, it is

ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
T'was near the year 1620,
When the Dutchman, you remember,
Brought our forefathers, numbered
many
To America, yea, not a penny.
They were brought to serve as slaves,
On the hilltops, in the caves
They sowed the wheat, barley and
rye,
Harvested the hay, in due time when
dry.
So, as the weary years rolled by
They had visions that the time was
nigh
When freedom would exclaim
somebody's soul,
That slavery had reached its final
goal.
But at last was bom a noble
Firm and undaunted, he took a stand
"For liberty I live, for liberty I die
Then sacrificed all for you and I.

ENFORCE THE LAW.
Below we publish a criticism of Sen*
ator Cummins by the editor of Detroit
Leader:
Republicans We Want a Square Deal.
"Senator Cummins will not do our
race any real justice, in his idea of
cutting down the Southern Delegation.
Evidence shows that the Southern
white politician would be satisfied with f^ilj
much smaller power if he enjoyed
that power alone. Justice demands '(of"
that the black man of the South should
receive a franchise without any re- \i£y
strlctions.
Aricle XIV.
Section 1. All persons born or natu
ralized in the United States, and sub
ject to the jurisdiction thereof, are
citizens of the United States and of
the state wherein they reside. No
slate shall make or enforce any law
which shall abridge the privileges or
immunities of citizens of the United
States nor shall any state deprive any
person of life, liberty, or property,
without due proces of law, nor deny
to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws.
Sec. 2. Representatives shall be ap
portioned among the several states ac
cording to their respective numbers,
counting the whole number of persons
in each state excluding Indians not
taxed. But when the right to vote at
any election for the choice of electors
for president and vice-president of the
United States, representatives in con
gress, the executive and judicial offi
cers of a state, or the members of the
legislature thereof, is denied to any of
the male inhabitants of such state, be
ing twenty-one years of age and citi
zens of the United States or in any
way abridged, except for participation
in rebellion or other crime, the basis
of representation therein shall bear to
the whole number of male citizens
twenty-one years of age in such state.
Now, Mr. Editor, the duty of every
law abiding citizen and every officer
of our country is to enforce the laws
and inflict the punishment for its vio
lation that is upon our statute books,
if it is a bad law repeal it and rnako
a better law. I believe that the South
would protest if we would cut their
representation down one-half as it
should be.

I#
Why Is it that the Northern ilftmb
llcan cannot stand for right and jus
tice In this matter of polices relative
to the southern Negro? No such
remedy is attempted with any other Vt
big issue in this country. The idea &&
of trying to assist one class of people
at the expense of another. It is not T,
American, it is not good republican- $
Ism. We want full right of franchise,
we want to be unmolested by the *.
Southern people in the enjoyment of &
that franchise. If this is a country
for, by and of the people, we want a
republican party to give us legislation
that will bring about the same benefits,
the same privileges that are enjoyed
by any other class of Americans.
"Direct primary, tariff, states rights,
foreign policies, an devery other ism
or cism under the sun is dealt with in
no manner like that of the Negro and
His Vote in the South. Is the repub
lican statesman going backward? Is
this the same party of '65? Is this
