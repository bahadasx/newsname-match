nomination to the supreme bench.

sel for the Pittsburgh oCla company

commission, reflecting upon Mr. Bran
deis' conduct as counsel in the so
called Ave per cent. case. A third,

League, thought Mr. Brandeis had not
offered the "impregnable defense!'
against advances expected of him
when he was counsel for eastern ship
pers in the 1910 advance cases.
Another witness today was C. Wl
Barron, connected with the Wall
Street Journal and the Boston News
Bureau, who suggested that Mr. Bran
deis' connection with the Equitable
Life Assurance case, the New Haven
case and the Lennox bankruptcy case
be investigated and, that Charles S.
Mellen, Moorfield Storey and others be
called to testify. Committeemen said
they would consider the suggestions,
but reached no decision as to who,
If. anyone, would be summoned in con
nection with the cases named.

watches. When he entered the sleep
ing car he robbed the conductor, James
Fitzgerald, who then ran from the car.

Governor of New York on the Activi

that he had been active in promoting
the Hughes candidacy or had been as
sociated with Frank H. Hitchcock in
the interest of any presidential aspir
ant. Governor Whitman said:
"I am personally acquainted with
Mr, Hitchcock and, of course, have a
high regard for him, as do all his
friends. I know nothing whatevet
about his political activities and am in
no way "Jfennected with any movement
looking toward the nomination for the
presidency of any of the- persons whose
names have been mentioned in that
connection. I have stated repeatedly
that I believe Justice Hughes would be
by far the strongest candidate, and
that he is, in my opinion, the choice
of the vast majority of the republi
can voters of the country. I still be
lieve that this is true."
