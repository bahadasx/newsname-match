may be ordered uy u oi/um ^a.i vim
ian during any one month from one
gallon to two quarts. The senate
voted down an amendment to reduct
P The amount to one quart a month.
When the bill rc-enacting the gallon
a month law came up Senator Car- j
lisle offered an amendment cutting !
down the amount from one gallon to j
one quart a month. This was reject^
ed by a majority of two votes, 21 to
Hf i'3. Those who voted for the quart
P were: Beamguard, Black. Brice, Carlisle,

"How much liquor is necessary for
an ordinary person a day?" was a
question discussed in the senate dur^
ing the debate on this bill. Senator
Patterson suggested four tablespoonfuls
a day but Senator Carlisle disclaimed
the ability to qualify as an
* expert on this point and so this moor
ed and vexed problem remained un- i
solvefl. Senator Carlisle then propos-1
^ ' ed an amendment cutting the allow- j
! ance to two quarts a month. i
Senator Hughes proposed an j
^ amendment allowing a person to order
a kalf gallon of whiskey of five dozen
V bottles of beer a month. I
^ ft^nator Black thought the allow- j
Iance ought to be cut to naif a gallon |
per month. j
Senator K?tcl::n and Senator Banks |
thought the gallon a month law j
should stand and the Fairfield senator
thought it would be breaking

Senator Sii'kler put in an amendment
allowing a person to order naif
f a pra'ion of whiskey a month or five
doz-?n bottles of teer.
Senator Frice wanted the amount!
k reduced to a quart and thought this
would break up bMnd tigerism. He
B -?aid that not ten men voted for prohibition
because they wanted the gal7on

Beer Outlawed, Too.

A amendment cutting down the amount
of liquor which can be ordered for
personal rce to half a gallon a
month.

I efforts to au?erd the act so as to alW*

Scnaroi Wijrhtnran said it seemed to

* used as a aeccy to keep other impor:on:
measures I'rom coming before the
general assembly. "I thought we
were through with this liquor business,"
said iho Saluda senator, who
^ called wn rho<-e ihaf wanted real prohibition
to ?*oire out and make a law
prohibiting the oiaering of any wmskev
He challenged them to make it
"air tight.'*
In the course of his debate Senator
Wightman said he had "never taken
* ^
a drink of riquor, smoked a cigarette,
or taken a c'n?w of tobacco, but I realize
that thi? does not ?i/ye me a ticket

The illicit liquor seller and the
banker who evades the law by cliadgir.g
usury were yoked together by
Senior Verner, who wants all such '
violators stin to the chaingang, as- (
setting they would make "a beautiful |
rnir." The Oconee senator said the j i
governor was enforcing the law< |
aga;' T iiquor selling, but wanted to
know what he was doing on enforcing i
other laws. He charged that bankers I
who violate the law by charging usurious
rates of interest were at rhe top _
socially. The Oconee senator was J
debating his bill to prohibit the charging
of a greater rates of interest than J
allowed by law. '
