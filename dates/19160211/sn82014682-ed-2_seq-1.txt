This is Contention of Liliuoka-
lani in "Protest" Filed in '
; i Court Today, :
Unless Queen.LIlIuokalanlis proved
to be -Insane, and "mentally lncompef
tent, and thereby not capable of on
tectlng . her -Interests, her - motion - to
dismiss the suit brought by Delegate
Kuhio against the trustees of the Lili
uokalanl Trust should be granted. '
This Is the contention of . the queen
In an "Objection and Protest" filed in
Circuit Judge Stuart's court today by
Judge Antonio Perry, counsel for Lili
uokalanL The objection and protest
is based on three separate grounds,
the point objected to being "the con
sideration by this court of the merits
of this suit and of any demurrers, an
swers or other pleadings from the re
spondents . . . and to this court's re
ceiving or requiring any answer .or
pleadings from the respondents . . .
until after determination of the mo
tion to dismiss heretofore filed."
The ftrst ground of the. protest is
that the . queen is of sound mind and
mentally competent to discontinue the
suit filed by Kuhio as her "next
friend," and that she is entitled of
right to have the suit dismissed.
It Is further alleged that the court
is without any further steps in the
case other than to declare It discon
tinued, unless the queen's sanity and
mental competency to dismiss'tthe
matter la challenged. ; But thus .' far,
the protest continues, the queen's san
ity and mental competency to discon
tinue the suit has not been challenged,
and the legal presumptions remains
that LUiuokalani is sane.
At 2 o'clock next Monday afternoon
Judge Stuart will, set a date for the
taking of evidence as to the queen's
sanity and mental competency. As to
how the court will proceed In the hear
Ing also will be determined at this
time. The respondents have ; been
granted an additional. 10 days to plead
to the petition flledby the delegate. :
