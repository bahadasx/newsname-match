ENOUGH,

Upper Branch Would Re
dude by Half Quantity oi
Liquor South Carolinian
May Import Within Foui
Weeks.
Prohibition measures were furthei
entrenched in South Carolina yesterday
when the senate by a vote of 2t
to 18 reduced the amount of liquors
that may be imported each month
from one gallon to two quarts. Earliei
in uic uiisiiiiiiK an uiueuuiiieilt lu limn
monthly shipments to one quart was
rejected by a vote of 21 to 23. Several
other amendments were offered
among these being two to allow the
alternative of beer shipments. One by
Senator Hughes of Union would provide
for 600 bottles or one-half barrel
of beer monthly. Senator Sinklei
of Charleston offered in substitute an
amendment to provide for 30 bottles
of beer. Vote was not taken on the
alternative amendments during the
morning session.
In the evening session the bill was
further modified by the adoption ol
the Hughes amendment, which provided
for monthly shipments of 6C
pint bottles of beer in lieu of the twc
quarts of whiskey. The amendment
was adopted by a vote of 22 to 19,
The Hughes amendment was furthoi
modified - to preclude shipments ol
beer with a content of alcohol greatei
than 5 per cent. Provision was alsc
made to have beer shipped in oper
cases, that rigid inspection might be
enforced. The bill i'n its entirety was
passed by a vote of 28 to 12.
Each senator was in his seat yesterday
morning, and a complete vote
was polled on the two amendment
calling for decisive action. Onf
changed vote on the first amendment
would in all probability have cut the
shipments to one quart. Such change
would have divided the forces equally
thus compelling: the president of the
senate, who is an ardent prohibitionist,
to cast the deciding: vote.
Spirited debate was engaged ir
during the mprning, this arguments
following the age worn lines of cleavage
between legislation with loopholes
and that which knows no compromise.
Senator Banks argued that
adoption of the amendment would
run counter to the expressed wish ot
the people, who had favored prohibition,
contingent upon retention oi
the gallon a month law. Senator Carlisle
emphasized that the referendum
referred particularly to manufacture
and sale only, without relation to importation.
Senator Black of Bamberg believed
the reduction of the amount would
aid materially in eliminating blind
tigers. Stock for illicit selling, he
said, could be easily supplied when
three or four would pool their monthly
shipments.
Senator Ketchin argued for the retention
of the law without modification.
Shipments could be received
from each express office in the county,
and reducing the amount, he said,
would only necessitate an increase in
x 1 1 < * ... - -
me numoer 01 omces to winch the
purchaser would have packages
shipped.
Senator Brice argued for I he passage
of the amendment, expressing
the belief that the reduction of the
amount to on equart would be more
effective in ridding the State of illicit
liquor dealers than would the Liles
bill, which proposes imprisonment
sentence, without the fine alternative.
Senator Alan Johnstone, Sr., of
Newberry, characterized the Sinkler
amendment as a "dangerous bill."
Express packages, the Newberry senator
pointed out, could not be broken,
and bottles of whiskey could be easily
inserted when cases were made up in
liquor houses. Its passage, he predicted,
would open a gateway which
would "destroy the dignity and effectiveness"
of the senate's act and
that passed by the people.
Senator Wightman of Saluda saw a
greater peril in soft drinks, which
form "the stepping stones to drunkenness."
The Saluda senator said he
had "never taken a chew of tobacco,
smoked a cigarette or taken a drink of
whiskey." If he had to be debauched
ny euner sort drinks or beer he'd
prefer the beer. He pleaded for total
elimination or the retention of the aet
in present form.
Senator Ginn of Hampton favored
the passage of the amendment. His
chief objection to the beer proviso was
that percentages of alcohol in beer
could be readily increased until the
content was nearly all alcohol, and
yet retain the name beer.
The vote for the Carlisle amendment,
reducing the shipments to two
quarts, which is a duplication of the
laws in effect in Georgia and North
Carolina, was:

! LETTER FROM TEXAS.
Wortham, Texas, Jan. 31, 1916.
Kind Editor and Readers:
I doubt if many of you will remember
me and perhaps none of you,
though I see some names mentioned
, in The Union Times which sound fa[
miliar to me.
J was born in the northern part of
. Union district; it was called district
when I lived there, near- Draytonville,
_ and the Cheroflee Iron Works. I lived
j there until I was 14 years old, then I
( went to Union or about three and one.
half miles from Jonesville. I lived
there until I came to Texas in 1871.
! January 16, 1871, I boarded the
r train at Union for my future home
. in Texas. The first nipht I spent in
y Texas was at Galveston. We came on
Kossee, which was the terminus
. of the H. and T. C. railroad thon
! from there took ox wagons and went
to Springfield, Limestone county, and
there we separated and each went to
t their new homes. The families with
whom I came were as follows: Tom
, McDonald, Jeff Ward, John Scott,
' Savage and Gregory, Bill Lipsy and
[ Tom Harris were young men who also
J came with us. I was just a young in: n
then and I have lived right here
[ ever since.
But since that time we have each
had our ups and downs and some
hay* passed to the world beyond. Some
( few are still living here- Mrs. jHprris
(nee Martha Scott) lives nearer
' ''e than any of the rest of the crowd.
She lives about a mile from me. She
spent a week with us not long ago.
[ I am an ex-subscriber to The Union
, Times and I like the paper fine. I
took it awhile after I left there, but
, became negligent and let my time run
out, but have renewed my subscription.
( If the editor will be kind enough to
publish this I may write again. If
like for them to write me and give
any of my old friends see this would
I their address.

LOCK HART WINS.
The Lockhart High school basketball
team met the Wesley Chapel High
school team on last Friday afternoon.
After some star playing by both
teams, Lockhart got into the game
proper for the victory. The Lockhart
five soon demonstrated their ability
over the visitors and the game re
suited in a score of 8 to 34 in favor of
the locals. For the visitors, Vaughn
was easily a star, shooting six of the
points made by his team. Good and
Broom were the most consistent players
for the locals. It is a self-evident
1 fact that Good for Lockhart is a natural-born
athlete, and we are depending
upon him to feature in Lockhart's
future victories. The fast locals, having
taken Wesley's Chapel scalp on
Friday afternoon, were smarting for
another victory on Saturday afternoon
when they met the Union High school.
The game was called at 3:30 with a
snap. Both teams were on their toes
for victory. The Union boys played
hard ball to the end, but the star goalshooting
of Good and Worthy and the
fast work of Engle at right guard
proved too much for the Union lads.
The game resulted in a score of 7 to
37 in favor of the local sagain.
On next Saturday afternoon the
Lockhart five will meet the fast Union
High school again on the Union court.
Those who see the game will have an
opportunity of seeing some excellent
High school basket ball.

HIGH SCHOOL AID
MEASURE PASSES
Lower Branch Gives Bill Unusual Majority?Drawn
by Supt. Swearingen?Makes
Tuition Free in
Rural Districts.
A bill relating to the high schools
->f the State and providing for State
aid was passed in the house last night
by the overwhelming majority of 89
to 9. The bill regulates the disbursement
of the $35,000 appropriation for
the advancement of high schools and
does away with the charging of tuition
in certain instances. The bill
has been indorsed by practically all
those connected with the public school
system of South Carolina.
Mr. Mills, speaking for the bill, said
that its purpose was to establish in
each county a school where boys and
girls can get college preparation with
free tuition. Another object of the
measure is to unify the high schools
and to enable such high schools to
derive the benefit of State aid with
less "red tape." He said that the
bill was approved by many of thoBe
connected with the department of education,
the measure having been
drawn by Supt. Swearingen and W.
H. Hand.
Mr. Bradford objected to the bill
on the ground of the appropriation
feature, which originally proposed
$80,000, and also because he thought
it would involve and derange the
present system of high schools. He
later withdrew his objections.
Mr. Johnstone said that the bill
made the following changes: The
abolition of a tuition charge in high
schools for boys and girls living
side of the limit of a city, and th?
establishment of a training school for1
teachers. Mr. Johnstone also pointed
out that the bill does not carry art
appropriation, but would facilitate a
more equitable disposal of the funds
already appropriated.
Mr. Crum, supporting the theory of
local self-government, opposed the
measure, claiming that "the sole purpose
of the bill is to allow every high
school to put its finger in the State
treasury." He said that the bill would
jnjure the country schools. M
Mr. Graydon said that the bill
would extend aid in addition to km
'25 high schools in t' t State, airi
maintained that the present law if
unjust to those schools. He si id that
the bill had been indorsed by the
State Teachers' association, superintendents
of education, city superintendents
and many officials in the
State department of education.
Mr. McUullough said that the bill
would enable many country boys and
girls to get the benefits of a high
school training.
The house accepted an amendment
by J. J. M. Graham to allow residents
of an adjoining county to attend
a high school in a town in anfusother
county. -?
By a large majority the house refused
to strike out the enacting word"
and later sent the bill to a third reading
on a year and nay vote of 89 to 9.
one of the largest majorities given
this year to a contested bill.

GIVEN A RECEPTION.
Prof. F. E. Shuford, after making
thorough canvass of his patrons, deded
that there should exist a closer
dation between the patrons of Bufilo
Graded school and the teachers,
e, therefore, hit upon the unique
lan of having his teachers to coop-ate
with him in giving: to the pa ons
of the school a public reception
t the school building. All who at>nded
the reception last Friday night
re loud in their praises of its suc)8S.
About 100^ were present.
The program consisted of music,

At the close of the program Prof,
huford called attention to the fact
iat each teacher was waiting in her
torn to receive her patrons and to
itertain them further by serving

^paired to the respective class rooms,
