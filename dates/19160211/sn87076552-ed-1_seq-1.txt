Comparatively few of our citizens
realize the rich opportunity that is
neing given in our town this week.
Many a housewife has wished she
might have had the advantage of the
modern schools in Domestic Science,
ana that she might still have this ad
vantage, without attending college,
the Agricultural Extension School in
Home Economics has been instituted
Miss Horst and Miss Sharpies, two
bright and practical graduates of the
Ohio Mate University are condueting
a very interesting school in Home
Economics in the basement of the M.
E. church this week. While much of
the instruction is concerning food and
its preparation they wish it under
stood that the subject is much broad
er than that including all that goes
to make a successful home. They aim
to teach the principles that underlie
home making and request that no one
refer to their work as a "Cooking
School"
As feeding the family requires an

time, a large proportion of the work
of the school is given to that subject
The standard foods, as milk, eggs,
meat, bread and cereals are each con
sidered in a separate lesson. Not only
is instruction given regarding the
pa'atability, digestibility, food value
and eot of each, but several ways of
preparing each are demonstrated be
fore the class, and each member is
r'ven an opportunity to taste the dif
ferent dishes.
On Tuesday afternoon Miss Horst

dress, considering why It is needed
and the many common mistakes of
the modern women In choosing tex
tiles, colors and styles.
On Tuesday evening an open meet

gave a brief address on Agricutural
Sense and Nonsense, giving a brief
history of the work of the Agricultur

REPUBLICANS AT SEA?
We note by the last weeks issue of
the Exposure that the Republicans
were all at sea. Well, that is a bad
state of affairs but not quite at bad
as being at sea without a pilot and
mutiny aboard, the condition of the
Democrat party.
Every day good old Democrats are
following that Peerless Leader from
Nebraska and deserting the ship
Prcpardness. The Phantom Bark in
which the president who was once to
proud to fight expects to sail int oof
fice next November.
One can see this majestic ship
"Prepardness" steering boldly through
the waters of Foreign Affairs armed
to the teeth with a typewriter and be
hind the gun that bold warrior from
Washington, D. C, literally slaughter
ing the foe with ultimatums and dip
lomatic notes.
The trouble with the Democratic
Party, is, it has too many leaders, in
fact all are leaders anG no one left
to be led. There is Wilson and Clark
and Bryan and Gen. Isaac Sherwood
and Harmon, poor old uncle Judson
who was twice elected Governor and
who built up the Democrat Party in
Ohio only to have it torn to pieces by
Jimmie Cox with his Arcadian dream
of a Government all administered by
himself. Then there is Sandles, Old
Put, editor of a paper, and friend of
the farmer, ready to sacrifice himself
at the first faint crow of the Rooster.
The Republicans may be at sea but
they will come into port when the
time comes victoriously with all flags
flying.

empty cans at 10:07 in the evening.
There is no branch of farming so
profitable as dairy farming. It as
sures the farmer a sure and steady
cash income from the sale of milk
and surplus calves and at the same
time adds to and restores the fertility
of the soil. ,

around Wauseon and Delta have

HARD TO GET UP

Yes, it is hard to get up in the

especially hard, but it is well worth
while to get up and go to Sunday
School. It brings you peasure and
profit. But not only that. Your go
ing may induce another to go, and
the other may need it, and so you
unconsciously "lend a helping hand."

There is no phase of rural education
that is more fruitful in Its results
than that phase represented by the
well chosen readable school library.
The town schools have their public
libraries and school libraries but the
rural school has ready access to
neither.
When will the creators of rural
school libraries learn, that the names
of those men whose biographies fill
the most of the pages of a text book
on literature do not write books that
are readable by boys and girls, with.
ovit vary caretful (previous training
there are very lew boys and girls (and
these few come from the homes of re
finement where the true value of good
books is well known) who will or can
read Shakespeare, Milton,' Browning,
Eliot, Scott, Thackery, Thoreau and
Tennyson. A pupil will now and
then read some of the above but the
taste is inherited, rather than acquir
ed in school.
Then again there are very few pu
pils who can read much of Longfel
low, Irving, Hawthorne, Wordsworth
or Dickens. Although these men are
very much more readable, than the
formen group mentioned. For the
average pupil there seems to be no
vein of common interest in the above
mentioned writers.
The live, alert, wide-awake country
lad however, finds a good many things
"in common" with such authors as
James Otis, G. A. Henty, Oliver Optic
Horatio Alger, Gene Stratton Porter,
Harold Bell Wright, Jack London,
George Barr McCutcheon and a host
of others. Understand. I am not say-
ing this last list of authors contains
the best in literature for I know bet
ter than this. However I do sav that
country boys and girls have some
thing "in common" with these au
thors. The love of Nature and of
God's Big Out of Doors, is there, and
expressed in a way that they can un
derstand.
The authors in this last list I call
my starters. I use them on the pu
pils to start them to reading. It is
easier to change ' an acquired taste
for reading than it is to start a pupil
reading. I
The library should be the busiest
department in - the whole school.
Nicely bound books in orderly rows
do not constitute a working library.
Such a library is an "ornamental"
one.
After testing for four years the
likes and dislikes of boys and girls
in this interesting subject of reading
and compiling some interesting facts
of my own, I have found out that the
most popnlar good books in the rural
schools are the following: The most
popular book is named first, the next
in popularity is second, etc. And
am glad to say that the book that is
read, and loved the. most-is: Aesop's
Fables, Black Beauty, A Boy on a
Farm, , The Swiss Family Robinson,

Splendid Course in Agriculture Being Given at Court
House This Week Instructors tM. A. Bachtell and
L. P. Bailey from Columbus College of Agri
cultureJust A Fair Attendance.
The Fulton County Extension
School opened a little late Monday
morning. Sessions in the course of
Agriculture are being held in the
court house while the school in Home
Economics is being held in the Metho
dist church.
The attendance at the opening ses
sion of the Agriculture School was
small, but has increased until a fair
number are in the school receiving
valuable instructions, from the able
State instructors, M. A. Bachtell, and
L. P. Bailey of the Columbus College
of Agriculture.
First on the program Monday
morning Mr. Bachtell took up . "Plant
b ood Available and Unavailable.
The growing of legumes adds nitro
gen to the sou. Ihis is because of
bacteria which live in nodules on the
roots and take nitrogen from the soil
air and pass it on to the clover. The
nitrogen is then distributed . through
out the tops and roots. To make full
est use of nitrogen it is necessary to
plow the legume tops under or feed
them and return the manure produc
ed. Used in this way legume actual
ly builds up the soil. Theoretically,
the growing of two tons of clover in
a four or five year rotation will main
tain the supply of nitrogen in soils
but nevertheless an effort should be
made to grow as much clover as pos
sible because soils should contain
more nitrogen than they do at pres
ent. If this is balanced up by pur
chased phosphoric acid we have the
foundation for large yields of follow
ing crops. Nitrogen is too expensive
to be purchased for general use.
Next Mr. Bailey gave a splendid
talk on "Dairy Standards." He said
milk can be produced cheaper in Win
ter months than in Summer months;
that our forefathers could only pro
duce milk in Summer months and
then sold same at 4c per pound which
equals 40c per hundred. , The con-

densories, said Mr. -Bailey are doing
a good work for the dairymen, by
raising the standard of milk, while
the creameries do not improve. He
urged the production of good pro
ducts; raising the quality, then de
manding the price.
Mr. Bachtell took up the subject
of "Legumes and Soil Fertility,' he
said that bacteria of various kinds
were necessary for growth, and that
warmth, moisture, air, lime, etc., have
influence on their growth. ,
The lecture that followed by Mr.
Bailey was on Silos and Silage, who
advocates home made silos and to
have two or three for Summer feed
ing; he discourages keeping more
than one man in the silo when filling
until within a few feet of the top.
The first lecture on Tuesday morn
ing's program by Mr. Bachtell was
"Soil Moisture". The speaker said
that clay soil contains more water
than sandy soil but sandy soil will
give off more water than clay soil on
soils that are well drained crops do
not suffer from drouth as they do in
soil not well drained, by keeping wa
ter table near . the same level.
"Feeding the Dairy Cow" by Mr.
Bailey came next, among the prin
ciples enunciated on this subject were:
Producing milk on the most econ
omical feed. Regularity and patata
bility are equal to balanced ration.
Farmers should grow their own grain
and have it crushed or ground use
beets for feed.
- "Alfalfa". In a splendid treatment
of this subject Mr. Bachtell said to
grow alfalfa, soil should be drained to
three feet or more below the surface,
and that it should be well supplied
with organic matter to be sweet
(made so by the? use of lime). Seed
bed should be properly inoculated and
well prepared 15 to 20 pounds of seed
should be used to the acre.

Thomas Alva Edison will reach the
8ixty-nirfth milestone of his life on
February the eleventh. Ihe years
seem to rest lightly on the great in
ventor. He is still hale, hearty and
active and as deeply interested in
what the coming year has in store
as a youth with all of life ahead.
"The future means as much to me
at sixty-nine as it does to you at
twenty-five, young main, said Mr.
Edison to a young friend not long
ago.
In other words, Edison is "still go
ing strong" at sixty-nine. Not a day
passes that he does not spend from
twelve to eighteen hours in his labor
atory. He shows no signs of slowing
up the pace he has held for over fifty
years. He is alert and not a detail of
the business around him escapes his
eye and attention. To those who are
associated with him in business
he is "Our Old Man." Edison, white
haired, stepping briskly, is a familiar
figure in every laboratory at Orange
New Jersey.
It is a difficult matter to corner
Thomas A. Edison, to get him really
to the point where he will give up
a few minutes to an interview. He is
naturally averse to interviews, any
way. He has a distaste for publicity.
He is a poor press agent. Like Na
poleon, he will gladly give up almost
anything except time. And when a
visitor is lucky enough to corner him
somewhere in the laboratory, the in
ventor is usually occupied with some
thing that demands his attention
every minute.
"Where's the 'Old Man'?" asks
someone who just must see Mr. Edi
son on important business.
"In the Lab," is the usual answer.
"Well, I've just got to see him."
"Not a chance. He's been in the
Lab all morning and he'll be there all
afternoon and part of the night from
the way thines look. Left orders not
to disturb him."
That's the way Edison spends most
of his time. In the Lab. And that's
how he will spend his birthday.
"Where do you intend to spend your
birthday, Mr. Edison?" asked a friend
the other day.
"It just depends," replied the in
ventor with a smile. "Over in the new
Laboratory maybe."
Mr. Edison's new Recording Labor
atory is a place to which visitors are
not admitted, but from all accounts
is a curiously constructed place, built
according to the inventor's specifica
tions to overcome certain problems of
acoustics in recording large orches
tras. 1
"I think I am going to be able to
nve vou records of -the great sym.
phonies before the year is out," Mr;
Edison said. "We already have
record on which they can be record
ed and a phonograph and reproducer
that will re-create them. It is now
merely a problem of recording the
large number of instruments used in
a symphony concert. 1 believe we
can do this in the new Recording La
boratory." i
Asked for a little birthday talk,
Mr.' Edison replied: "The way to be
happy and healthy is to be busy all
the time. I find that as I approach
sixty-nine I have just begun to live,
If you are busy you don't have time
to grow old. I don't work by the
clock and accordingly I don't feel that
i am getting any older. 1 work till
I finish a thing, and then," here Mr,
Edison smiled, "If there is nothing
else to be done, 1 go home.
"I hope that everyone will feel as
young and as pleased with life as
do when their sixty-ninth birthday
comes along."
It is safe to say that no man on
earth has ever crowded so much use
fulness into a single lifetime. The
genius of Edison which evolved the
electric light a single invention
which practically turned night into
day throughout the world and did
more to suppress crime than all the
laws passed in the last century is
still undimmed. Just a few years ago
he gave to the world his latest and
favorite invention. The Diamond Disc
Phonograph, whidh actually Re.
Creates music, as distinguished from
a mere mechanical reproduction of
musical sounds.
Edison was born at Milan. Ohio, I
on February 11, 1847. He early evinc
ed a love for chemistry and its kind
red subjects. Few men have ever run
at a swifter pace up the stepping
stones to fame. His first employ
ments was as a newsboy on the Grand
Trunk Railway where he started a
small weekly paper which at one time
had four hundred paid subscribers. He
next took up telegraphy and soon
became an expert telegrapher. Af
ter five years of telegraphy he came
to New York where after a short time
he sold his first invention for about
$40,000. Then he plunged into the
realm of invention where his. genius
seemed to run riot. Take his major
inventions as they come:

February is blessed with three holi
days, days that will be celebrated in
numerous ways and by various
classes.
First, Lincoln's birthday, which
falls on Saturday February 12th;
though not a legal holiday in Ohio it
would be well for us all to do honor
by turning back for just a little
thought on the life of one of the su
premely great men. of his day. He
grows bigger and better all the time,
and in a thousand years from now his
fame will be immensely vaster than
it is at the present time. No man in
all the tide of time ever filled a
more difficult or trying place than he
held for four years, and the verdict of
history is that he measured squarely
up to his tremenduous responsibilities.
There are many : reasons why he
should be honored and why he has
justly been given the title of "Typical
American."
Second, the day when "love is
King", St. Valentine's day, comes on
Monday the 14th of February, and for
days past - the younger generations
have been, working with, colored card
boards, gay ribbons, tinsel and silken
flowers preparing to demonstrate the
present day customs of St. Valentine's
Day. This day has greatly degenerat
ed in recent years. There was a
time when it held an honored and
prominent place among its sister fes
tivals and was almost religiously ob
served."" So far as young people were
concerned, this festival in olden times
was the keystone of the years social
activities. It had a special signifi
cance understood by all, and was a
spendid means of matchmaiang or
promoting- early marriages. Surely
there is no reason why "the divine
passion" should not have a day dedi
cated to its celebration and diffusion.
On this day it behooves the unmated
to obey his unwritten but potent and
agreeable mandate.
Third, Washington's birthday
Tuesday February 22nd. At a sea
son like this it is good to turn DacK
to the hour of the nation's birth and
lav our e-arlands on the tomb of him
who made this republic possible by
his possession of just those qualities
of patience and magnanmity ana nope
which most we need in view of the
difficulties and perils of the present
hour. . . .

WAR UPON PAIN.
Pain is a visitor to every home and
usually it comes unexpectedly. But
you are prepared for every emergency
if you keep a small bottle of Sloan's
Liniment handy." It is the greatest
pain killer ever discovered. Simply
laid on the skin no rubbing requir
edit drives the pain away. It is
really wonderful. .' ,
Mervin H. Soister, Berkeley, CaL
writes: "Last Saturday, after tramp
ing around the . Panama Exposition
with wet feet, I came home with my
neck so stiff that I couldnt turn. I
applied Sloan's Liniment freely and
went to bed. To my surprise, next
morning the stiffness had almost dis
appeared, four hours after the second
application I was as good as new."

WAR-BOUND SWITZERLAND.
Little Switzerland is entirely sur
rounded by great nations at war, yet
the country which is only one-third as
large as 'New York, state hasn't been
picked on by any of its neighbors.
Why?,, Because Switzerland has a
first-rate army guardingMts borders.
You will find much of interest about
Switzerland in the special illustrated
