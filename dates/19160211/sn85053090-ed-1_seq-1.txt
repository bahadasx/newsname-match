EKALAKA, (FALLON COUNTY) MONTANA, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1916
NUMBER 6
Is Held at The Botner School
House Saturday.
A ROUSING MtETING
~~™
At the meeting held at the
Botner school house on little
Beaver creek last Saturday there
was a good attendance and the
spirit ran high. The purpose of
the meeting was to encourage
the construction of a railroad
from some < f the existing lines
into the Little Beaver creek val
ley and the Ekalaka country.
Invitations were sent to Baker
and Ekalaka, but owing to the
weather conditions the Baker
people were unable to attend.
Ekalaka had a representation at
the meeting and it was decide 1
to hold another meeting at tho
Botner school house on February
19th and in the meantime the
people of the several localities
from Kingmont, Fertile Prairie,
Minnesota Valley, Wi lard, Ba
ker, Webster Bisher, Knobs,
Medicine rocks, Cook's school
house, Ekalaka, Beaver Flat and
the Chalk Buttes country are ur
get to select representatives to
send to the meeting on the 19th,
at which time it can be depended
upon lhat some very definite
steps will be taken towards se
curing the building of a railroad
bewfiting these communities.
Everywhere one goes the talk
is for the construction of such a
line and there is no doubt as to
the earnestness of the farmers
and merchants in the several lo
calties regarding the matter. The
need of such a road is evident
when the possibilities of so large
an area of fertile lillable land!
and the rapidly increasing wealth
of the country through which
the road will pass are considered.
The urgent demand of the peo
ple is that something be done to
ware* a road at an early date and
every possible effort will be made
to get the proposition under way
as soon as conditions will per
mit.
Tuesday evening a meeting!
was held 'n Ekalaka when the.
railroad proposition was discuss
ed. The people of this section
who were in attendance express
ed as in hearty favor of the move
and signified their willingness to
aid in every possible manner the
railroad boosters. Other meet
ings are to beheld here, the next
one being scheduled for the eve
ning of Feb. 22nd. As to Baker's
attitude the following resolution
as recently passed by the Cham
ber of Commerce is self explana
tory
"Resolved, That realizing the
fact that the retardation of ans
part of Fallon county is a handi
cap to the county in its entirety,
desire offer such assistance

Conser Slated.
Speaking of political possibili
j ties in the local arena, it has
j been brought to our attention
I through various sources that
! our esteemed friend and brother,
L. A. Conser, editor of the Baker
jSentinal, has lately been bracing
; himself for a shock of republi
can lightning. Now, while it is
ja novel procedure for a democra
■ tic paper to endorse a man of
i such strong republican affiliations
as our good brother of the Lake
City, we doubt very much if an
inordinate sense of modesty
would permit the gentleman from
furthering his own personal in
terests to the extent of announc
ing himself as a candidate for
office through the regular chan
nels, notwithstanding the faci
that at the recent republican
love feast at Baker his symptoms
were diagnosed as a "superfluity
of verbosity".
Bu' not being cognizant of the
wishes and machinations of that
great body of G.O.P. warhorses,
Eddie Booth and John Oliver—or
rather we should say the Repub- j
lican Central Committee of Fall- i
on County —we are unable to !
mention Bro. Conser's name au- j
thoritatively in connection with j
any particular office. However. !
merely by way of suggestion ami !
to start the ball a'rolling, we I
d iff our lid and whisper, "Hoo !
ray for Conser, for Commission
er of Agriculture, Publicity ant

Concerning Subscriptions
Commencing April 1st even
subscriber to the Eagle who i.
in arrears will lie dropped frori
>ur list and thereafter the "pai<
n advance" policy will be strict
;y adhered to. You may ask
"why tins sudden change of oui
mind?" but were you to delve
lown into the depths of our sub
?i'iption books and go back ovei
he pages for the last sever,
years the facts found then,
would convince the most skepti
cal that 'that while a person's
ippearance may take a good pic
; ure i t d oe s n ' t pa v to t ake the
shot". While it might be a mat
ter of only a dollar or two with
each delinquent subscriber, when
you commence to add up the to
tals you wonder why we didn't
• hin k of it before. Fact of the
matter is we have been thinking,
md just as a gentle reminder,
about every thirty davs since the
inixup in
inixup over in Europe began we
have received notices from our
supply houses of increases in the
price of paper stock, inks, etc.,
and still the "high bid" is not
yet reached. Regardless of the
extra expense that we have been
subjected to, we have asked you
tor no raise, but unless we are
successful in putting the Eagle
subscription list on a cash basis,
it must come. If one-third or
even one-half of our subscribers
drop from our list and the rest
pay we will be many dollars to
the good, but we are going to
take the chance of getting the
money and still retain our splen
did list of readers.
When a prospective advertiser
looks over our list and we can
show him that each and every
subscriber has paid up and thus
signified himself as desiring the
paper, no doubt he will be
come a customer, but should he
find that we carry a list of non
pays he will become skeptical,
possibly accuse us of "padding"
our list to secure his patronage.
In truth there is success and in
getting paid for our labors in
sures as much.
Sixty and 30 days respective
ly before any subscription be :
comes due we will mail a state
ment of account and believe that
in nine cases out of ten an honest
renewal will reward our efforts.
Registration Information.
The registration law passed in
.911 provided that every elector
n the state should re-register,
)ut that after so registering, he
leai never register again, unless
ie failed to vote at a general
'lection held every two years in
November. However, in case a
'egistered elector moves from one
orecinct to another, he should
sign a change of registration, in
Jt'iler to get his name transferred
nb the proper precinct book.
All electors residing within ten
nibs of the court house must
'egister before the county clerk.
Per those residing a greater dis
ante, there has been a deputy
-egstrar appointed in each pre
cinct in the county. Every elec
tor must register before the dep
uty appointed fur his precinct in
.vhbh he resides, or, if he so de
sires, before the county cierk.
An elector moving from the coun
ty in which he is registered to
another county in this state
should, in registering in the
county to which he moved, in
form the county clerk or deputy
registrar that he is so registered,
and sign a form of change of
registration, as well as re-regis
tering as though he had never
been registered ; this for the pur
pose of cancelling his former
registration and advising the
clerk of the county of his former
residence thereof.
Electors may register at any
time up to 30 days before each
election, during which 30 days
the books are closed for that par
ticular election only. However,
during this 30-day period elec
tors may register and be qualified
to vote at the next ensuing elec
tion after the one for which the
registration is closed.
A large number of electors
have moved from precinct to pre
cinct and have failed to appear
at the county clerk's office and
transfer their registration. Some
of them will lose their votes by
neglecting to attend to this mat
ter. Also, a large number of
women who are qualified electors
have failed to register. Putting
this off until the last minute re
sults in swamping the registra
tion office and increasing the
likelihood of errors in compiling)
the books. It is therefore urged
that all electors who are not sure
whether they are correctly reg
istered make inquiry at the reg
istration office and satisfy them
selves that they are entitled to
vote.
"If by any reason of physical
infirmity the elector is unable to
appear before the county clerk
or any deputy registrar he may
send written notice to ihe county
clerk or to the deputy registrar,
of such disability with the re
quest that his registration be
made at his residence. Upon re
ceipt of such notice and request
it shall be the duty of the county
clerk or deputy registrar, as the
case may be, to make the regis
tration of such elector at his res
idence." — From 1915 Session
Laws.
When a notary public resides
wi thin the boundaries of a pre
cinct, he is appointed to act as
deputy registrar; and in precincts
where more than one notary re
sides, they can all act. In pre-j
cincts where there is no notary
oublie a deputy registrar must be
appointed by the county clerk.
This does not apply to notaries
living within a radius of 10 miles
of the county seat.
Far well's Term to Expire.
County Attorney Chas. Dous
man has issued an opinion setting
forth the fact that County Com
missioner George Farwell will
find his term of office as expired
on January 1, 1917. There has
been considerable discussion as
to Mr. Farwell's holding over
for the term to which his prede
cessor C. L. Wood was elected,
which would not have expired
until Jan. 1, 1919, but as Attor -j
ney Dousman secures his findings j
from decisions of the supreme '
court the question is settled. No '
doubt Commissioner Farwell will !
be the democratic nominee foi !
that office, and as his past record '
has been proven -Al his chances !
of being elected are very promis- !
ing.
Issues Statement.
Yesterday's daily Montana pa
pers carried the following an
nouncement as to the candidacy
of Governor S. V. Stewart foi

advance of the primary date in
order to answer the many inquir
ies that come to me from day to
