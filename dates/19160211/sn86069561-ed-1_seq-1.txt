of sickness in this neighborhood.
Master Thomas Wallen visited
friends in Btrea from Saturday
until Monday. Mrs. Ben Cum

She had been sick only, a few
days. She leaves a husband and
three children, also a father,
brothers and sisters to mourn the
loss of a devoted companion and
loving mother, wnose place can
never be filled. Funeral services
were held at the church by Rev.
J. G. Soward, after which the re
mains were laid to rest by the
side of the infant which preceded
her only four days. Thejhusband
and two of the children were sick
at time of Mrs. Cummins death
and unable to attend the funeral.

the parents, however, are inter
ested in the educational welfare
of their children. But one thing
is lacking on the part of the par
ents here as well as in other
places, they do not encourage the
teacher as they shouid. It takes
more than the teacher to have suc
cessful schools. If auy one on
earth needs encouragement, it is
the teacher. No one only those
who have experienced teaching
knows how much a word of praise
ora visit from the parent, helps
and encourages the teacher. Par
ents, if you have any flowers for
us, give them while we're h'ving,
don't save them lor our coffin lids.
and if you have a wcrd of praise
say it while we can hear.

Mt. Vernon, Ky., Feb. 7, 1916.
The Signal,
Mt Vernon, Ky.
Dear Sin
It may be of interest to the
Signal to know that the writer is
the owner of an old Cremona vio
lin. This violin was made some
240 years ago by Nicolaus Ama
tius, an Italian violin maker, and
has within it the following Latin
inscription- "Nicolaus Amatius
Hieronimi Filii Antoni Nepos
fecit in Cremonem A. D. 1676."
By some authorities Amatius
is considered the maker of the
world's best violins, while by oth
ers, his son; the maker of the
'Stradivarius," is claimed as the
champion. However this may be,
it is a well known fact amone
proficient violinist that the Cre
mona possesses that rare beauty,
tenderness and volume of tone
that no other make holds, and in
the hands of a master it is capa
ble of holding whole audiences
spell-bound. To the Famous Old
Master such a violin has no value
in dollars and cents but for com
mercial convenience they range in
price from $5000 to $75000.
According to tradition this vio
lin has been in the Bryant family
since the Revolutionary War; tak-
en, it is
claimed, Irom a Royal
prisoner. It is in an excellent
.tat - of nrrvatinn.
