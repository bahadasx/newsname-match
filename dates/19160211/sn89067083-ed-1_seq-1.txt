Outlook.
According to a statement made
by John T. Fritzpatriok, state
labor commissioner, 1915 is to be
the greatest year ever known
for labor in Missouri and the
United States. Fitzpatrick says
that there is an insistent demand
from the east upon the west for
labor. This demand, he says, is
principally from the railroads
and iron and steel industries.
Marshall John McAllister, who
shot and killed Jim Jones at
Bloomfield two weeks ago, was
aoquitted on preliminary trial at
Bloomfield on last Saturday, The
evidenoe was strong, showing
that it was a oase of eelf defense,
and that Jones attempted to shoot
McAllister and did snap hia pis
tol at him before MoAlliBter
fired. It was further proven that
Jones in his drinking period had
threatened the marshal and
stated he would kill him. -Dexter

may in the end benefit this com

large quanities. Besides the
large Chicago corporation re
cently organized with sufficient
oapital to take over the rich iron
lands in Butler and Wayne coun

million corporation has been
organized in St. Louis and will
take over the old St. Louis Blast
Furnace Co., and will enlarge
the plant and build more to it.
When the Pico Iron Mines near
this oity were operated a tew years

marks of exposure and bis clothes
were anything but clean or com

Congressman Russell, some
weeks ago introduced a bill in
congress to pay a claim of $128.
24 cents due Thomas R. Mason,
of Dexter, Stoddard oounty, for
services rendered 60 years ago,
while carrying the mail in Ken
tucky and Tennessee. On ao
oount of the outbreak of the civil
war the route was suspended and
the amount due him entered on
the Books of the postoffice depart
ment at Washington, but was
never paid. Mason afterwards
moved to Missouri and a bill has
passed the house three times to
pay this claim, but failed to
reach j fit- .Hfenatti.- Sinoe' Con
gressman Russell introduoed the
bill at this session, Mr. Mason
has died, but Mr. Russell hopes
to get the claim allowed for the
benefit of the widow, who sur
vives. Last year horses could hardly
be given away, while mules had
slumped about fifty per oent in
value, but now a big change has
taken place, especially regarding
mules, for well built animals are
in demand and are bringing
prices about like in "the good
old days." As evidence of this
assertion a number of sales made
in the last few days will serve.
Hez Estes bought a span of mules
from Russell Webb for $485, paid
C. C. Gladiah 1450 for a team
and $425 to John Oladish for a
span. On. Monday also he paid
Ferdinand Kuhle $400 for a team.
Wash Gladish sold one team to a
dealer for $390, while a number
of sales of single horses and
mules have been made at $150
and $160. There is a demand
from the warring countries, but
the big factor is that the south
again has money with which to
enter the market. Jackson

Not long ago the ' National
Forestry " Association of the
United States, gave a big tree
contest by whioh they made
effort to locate ail the extra large
trees in the United States. We
do not know of a tree around
here eligible in this contest but
on the farm of C. J. Sorrel east of
this oity, there is still the re
mains of what was at one time
undoubtedly one of the largest
trees in this seotion. Only the
stump now remains. Some twen
ty years ago Uncle Mart Cline
and a lumberman by the name
of Ah r en measured this tree,
which was a poplar, and found it
32 feet in ciroumferenoe. Some
time later the tree was out.
Several charges f dynamite
have been unsuccessfully fired
under it and It still resists all
attempts to burn it. Even now

U Grippe. ,
Furnished by the Deportment of Pre
tenure Medicine, UnWeralty of
, ' , Missouri, Columbia, Mo.
For the last five or six weeks,
the oountry, from one end to the
other has been experiencing an
epldemio of what is generally
known at grippe. , '
Symptoms are those of a se
vere' oold with more or less aore
tj(roat, aough, pains in the head
and about the body. In eome
eases the symptoms are quits
persistent.,, .
It sseme oertain that the great
majority, at least, of these oases
are not true grippe. Some bac
teriologists have reported finding
Streptococcus in the throat and
nok the baoillus , whioh causes
grppe. Nevertheless, the pre
vention is exaotly the same for
such a oase as for the true grippe.
, .The disease is .acutely conta-
Igious. Contagion takes place
most readily by direct oontaet.
The more intimate and prolong
ed Vtli is oontaet, the greater the
danger of ooutaglon. Persons
should avoid crowds as muoh as
possible, and if it is neoessary to
be with those suffering from the
symptoms wbioh hava been de
soribed, they should insist as far
as possible upon euoh persons
keeping at a respectful distance.
While coughing or sneezing, the
person afflioted should keep the
mouth and nose covered with a
handkerchief. Kissing, espec
ially, should be avoided. The
habit whioh many mothers have
of blowing the noees of a number
of children in the sains handker
chief should pot bo practiced., .
There ie no speeifio whioh will
prevent this cold. The best
methods of prevention are a good
diet, consisting of nutritious, but
light, foods,(the use of the oold
baths daily, sleeping with an
abundanoe of fresh air and the
avoidance of excesses of all kinds.
Especially to be avoided is pro
longed overheating in olose,
stuffy rooms and railroad trains.
Avoid patent medioines in the
treatment. Those reoommended
for the relief of such symptoms
almost invariably ocntain the
coal-tar preparations, moet of
which depress the heart and are
dangerous. Consult a good phy
sioian and do not fill the system
with dope.
Formalin Treatment of Seed
Uats.
C. B. Hutehlnon, Unlvewlty of Mil
souri, College of Agriculture.
Missouri farmers probably
loose about two million bushels
of oats a year from the decrease
in yield beoause of smut. At the
1915 farm prioe of about thirty
seven cents a bushel, this amounts
to a loss of $740,000 a year whioh
is easily prsvented by means of
the formalin trsatment of seed
oats.' The seedlike snore of
smut pass the winter in the grain
and when the untreated kernel
sprouts in the apring the spores
begin to row and develop a little
plant within the oat plant. The
smut plant remains near the top
of the growing oat plant and is
ready to replaoe the kernels with
black dustlike spores whioh givs
the heads the black appearanoe
whioh they present in the fields
and blow to other oat plants to
infect the young grain from whioh
next year's seed must be eeleot
- The best method that the Mis
souri College of Agriculture can
reoommend tor preventing this
loss i is the formalin treatment.
Mix with forty or fifty gallons of
water, a pint of formalin (forty
per oent formaldehyde), which
can be aeoured at any drug store.
The oats may be saoksd and dip
ped in a barrel of thia solution
until they are thoroly soaked, or
piled on the barn floor and thor
oly sprinkled with it. After treat
ment they should be covered with
blankets or saoks for four or five
houre so that the formalin will
not evaporate too quiokly, but
they must be stirred frequently
until thoroly dry in order that
they may not heat.
Some inexpensive machines
now on the market for treating
what and oats give very good
results. They pass the grain
thru a tank containing formalin
and dump it out on the floor to
dry.
Altho formalin has a very un
pleasant effect upon the eyes and
Is vry poisonous, it Is not really
dangerous to handle in such a
weak solution and any left over
seed may safely be fed to any
farm animal after it has been
thoroly aired for some time.
Tye Law of Diminishing
Returns.
Deep soil and sufficient plant
food are no more essential for
growing oorn than room. It we
had unlimited land at our dispo
sal and wanted to grow 100 bush
els of. corn, we could raise that
amount with the least effort by
planting a large number of aores.
But land is all oocupied. We
cannot have all we need to pro
duce the 100 bushels with the
least labor. Instead of planting
a large area in oorn, we reduoe
the number of acres and put on
more labor. One hundred bush
el! can be produced on two .acres
on most land in Southeast Mis
souri with a very moderate
amount of labor. One might pro-
duoe this amount on one acre If
be would give the neoessary la
bor. Suppose to produoe 60 bushels
of corn on one aore required 20
hours of labor. It does not fol
low that if we put 40 hours of la
bor on the same aore we could
grow 126 bushels. A total of 40
hours would probably produoe
only 80 bushels. That is, the
first 20 hours produced 60 bush
els and the second 20 hours pro
duoed only 20 bushels.
In an article last week we tried
to show how a system of renting
land could be devised that would
equitably distribute this last 20
bushels between the landlord and
tenant. If the landlord reoeived
only one-third up to 60 bushsls
and a smaller per cent or none at
all produoed above 60 bushels,
the tenant would be enoouraged
to do better farming.

Manure The Wheetfield.
There are few places where ma
nure shows better returne than
in top dressing wheat during the
fall and winter. This is particu
larly true on thin land where
wheat starts slowly in the spring
and where Mover and grass are
apt to fail. The readily available
plant food from the manure gives
a quiok thrifty growth, while the
surfaoe protection offered aids
materially in preventing freezing
out.
A top dressing of this kind al
most insures a grass or olover
stand on land where these crops
are inclined to fail. The manure
should be applied at the rate of
five to seven loads to the aore
with a manure spreader. It may
be soattered by hand but it ie
difficult to get it on evenly in
suoh small quantities. It is best
to set the manure spreader in the
lowest notch and make the sup
ply of manure cover aa much
ground as possible. M. F. Mil

HOLD BEAR HUNT IN PARK
Fireman Finally Kills Bad-Tempered
Pet Which Hid Been City Zoo
Attraction,
Elkhart, Ind. A real bear bunt ta
WUlowdale park followed the eecapol
of a two-year-old bear owned by Frasic;
Brumbaugh. The animal had been
sent to Mr. Brumbaugh when a cub:
by a friend In northern Michigan.' It
recently developed a bad temper and!
the owner decided to have It killed.
Brumbaugh and bis brother, Charles,;
led Babe, as the bear was known, out
of a barn. The animal broke away'
and resisted capture so strenuously
that both men suffered tooth and claw
wounds on their hands. They then
permitted the fugitive to trot to the
nearby park. .
Frank Little, a city fireman, who la
known as a good marksman, was sum
moned with his ride. His first ahot
only wounded the bear, which then
climbed to the top of a high oak, roar
ing defiance. Little's second shot
brought down the animal, the ball
piercing Its brain. The bear waa one
of the attractions In the city park too
during the summer.
