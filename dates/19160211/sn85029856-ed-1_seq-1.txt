effort to get. Be on hand about 8:110

A Sure Enough
Chief
of Police
Chief of Police McMurray blossomed
out Wednesday in full panoply of
war. Ills new suit arrived that dav
and he now patrols the streets In a
uniform that' can be seen a mile
away. Not only is he sporting a uni
form, but a regulation police hat with
the 'word "Chief" emblazoned there
on, and a metal sign with all the fan
cy frills necessary are part of the
equipment. The only thing missing
is the familiar "billey" and Mac. re
fuses to carry that. If the city coun
cil would now issue an order for the
other policemen to equip themselves
in like regalia Liberal would have a
bunch of officers that would command
respect whenever they appeared upon
a scene of disturbance, and wouldntbe
so hard to find when an officer is
wanted.
..Hon.
Eugene W. ,
i Chaf in to be Here
Hon Eugene W. Chatin, twice can
didate for president on the prohi
bition ticket, will be in Liberal to
morrow and lecture at the Christian
church in the evening at 8 o'clock.
Mr. Chafin Is a lecturer of ability and
will have an important message for
the people of Liberal. No admission
will be charged. Come out and hear
him.

Chased a Coyote
With His Jackson
John Eden, local agent for the
Jackson car, made a busimss trip to
Forgan last week and when about 5
miles west of that town on the re
turn trip a coyote crossed the road in
front of him. John immediately gave
chase and the radiator of the car was
i about, six feet from the wolf when he
slipped under a fence and John had
to abandon the race. 1 1 ai tie been
allowed ano.her hundred feet the coy
ote's mangltd remains would have
perhaps bftn scattered all over the
northern part of Beaver county In a
few seconds. The chase lasted about
half a mile and was made over rough
ground with six passenifrs in the car,
which is a good record for the "pick-Ing-up"
qualities of the Jackson-Four.
