BRITAIN'S FLEET READY
Is I Hi t of Pre mi rot! ness Awaiting
German's North Sea Dash.
Somewhere in the North Sea, Via
London, Feb. 11. Great Britain's
first line offensive fleet, an incom
parable combination of speed and gun
power ready for instant action, was in
spected yesterday by a party of French
and A merica n correspondents and a
representative of the Associated Preso
was permitted to view from the bridge
of a torpedo boat the naval unit which
is expected to meet the first shock of
a German attack.
In the fleet were virtua lly all the
veteran fiuhtlng craft which have
been in action in this war. but they
showed few scars except an occasional
dnt in their armor. The pride of
place was held by battle cruisers
which in engagements from the Falk
land I wles to the Dardanelles have
borne the brunt of the sea fighting.

BOOM FORJUDGES
Kansas Democrats Urge Ap
pointment Former Governor
To I'lace Made Vacant by
Resignation of Garrison.
SUPPORT IS UNSOLICITED
Olathe Man Has Tot Indicated
Desire for Office.
The Movement Originated in
the State House Today.
President Wilson was today urged
to appoint George H. Hodges of Ola
the, former governor, as secretary of
war to succeed Lindley M. Garrison,
resigned. Numerous telegrams urg
ing Hodges' appointment have been
sent by prominent Kansas Democrats.
The Hodges boom was started to
day among state house Democrats,
several of whom believe the former
governor may be a formidable candi
date for the important office. En
dorsements were solicited from a num
ber of prominent leaders and a real
campaign will be made to land the
well known Kansas man in the cabi
net. In addition to telegrams to Pres
ident Wilson, it is probable That mem
bers of the Kansas delegation in
Washington will be asked to urge the
Hodges appointment.
The unexpected resignation of Sec
retary Garrison gave Kjinsas Demo
crats a chance to push the appoint
ment of the former governor for a
cabinet position. Hodges was an orig
inal Wilson supporter and was for a
time strongly considered for a place
on the new federal trades commission.
Places on the commission carried sal
aries of 510,000 a year. Following his
term as governor, Hodges indicated
that he would like a place on the im
portant commission. The fact that
Senator Thompson swung his support
to Henry J. Waters, president of the
Htate Apricutural college, split the
Kansas delegation and probably pre
vented the state's receiving recognition
on the commission.
Telegrams Arc Sent.
Hodges has not indicated that he is
In any manner a candidate for the
big job held by Secretary Garrison.
Friends in Topeka and in other parts
of the state, however, have sent a
number of telegrams urging the ap
pointment One telegram today was signed by
W. K. Brooks, chairman and Stance
Myers, treasurer, of the stcte board
of control; Senator J. W. Howe, Abi
lene; C. F. Foley, member of the pub
lic utilities commission, and W. F.
Benson, state bank commissioner. The
telegram read :
"Many Kansas Democrats would he
pleased to have you appoir t George
H. Hodges, former governor; as sec
retary of war. Unquestionably he
would make an excellf nt secretary."
Col. William F. (Bill) Sapp, Demo
crat national committeeman, was In
Topeka today. He was urged to en
dorse the boom launched for Hodges
and it is probable that he will semi a
telegram to Washington late this aft
ernoon. GERMANS GOT MONEY
Swiss Find Federal Insurance Fund Is
Now in War Bonds.
Paris, Feb. 11. A Geneva dispatch
to the Journal says public opinion in
Switzerland is deeply moved by the
revelation that responsible officials of;
the federal insuranee directorate
transferred all the federal insurance j
funds, with the exception of six hun- j
dred thousand francs, into German
bonds and stocks since the war began.
This discovery, the dispatch says,
was made by the board of auditors of
the federal council during the period
ical examination of the insurance
records.
The Swiss federal council in 1911
passed thefederal insurance law for the
purpose of which several million
francs were appropiiated. The Swiss
law alluded to was in two parts, the
first providing for insurance against
illness and the second for insurance
against accident, which involved the
establishment of an annual fund of
8,000,000 francs.
Opposition was made to the second
part of the measure on the ground
that so large an appropriation would
endanger the national treasury and
that it was a doubtful adventure for
the state to undertake a form of busi
ness which had previously been re
garded as the proper domain of pri
vate companies. Both parts of the law
were fUially adopted by 250.000
against 220.000 on the referendum
vote by the Swiss people.
CHAINED U? 6 MONTHS

Atlanta. Ga.. Feb. 11. Chained to
the concrete "slipping post" at the
state prison at Milledgeville ever since
he made his murderous attack upon
Leo M. Frank, -William Green will
soon be released and put in a soli
tary confinement cell.
The prisoner has been fastened to

months After his attack upon Frank,
which stirred the country, the prison
authorities were obliged to take steps
to prevent him making attacks upon
other prisoners.
SANTA FE WILL
BUILD ADDITION
TOPEKA SHOPS
Railway Appropriates $70,000
for Xew Buildings.
Machinery for Construction of
Heavy Steel Forgings.
NEW MACHINE IS IN PLACE
It Weighs 150 Tons and Cost
$15,000 Set Up.
Largest Used in Any Railway
Shop in the Country.
Plans have been completed by thj
Santa Fe for the erection of a 162-foot
addition to the present blacksmith
shops in Topeka. The new structure
will be added to the north side of
the old building and when equipped
will cost $70,000. It will conform to
the present shop in construction and
appearance. The frame work will be
of heavy steel, the walls of brick and
the roof of red tile.
The new shop will be devoted ex
clusively to the making of heavy forg
ings and will contain besides five large
steam hammers, a forging machine,
said to be the largest used in any
railway shop in the country.
The machine which will cost $15,
000 when set up is already on the
ground and has been placed in the
location it will occupy in the new
building. It is thirty feet lor.g, fifteen
feet wide and twelve feet high and
weighs approximately 150 tons. A
special car used for shipping guns was
chartered to transport the machine to
Topeka.
The new "six-inch" forging machine
will be used principally to reclaim
material that is now finding its way
into the scrap piles.
A contract or the steel to be used
in constructing the new shep has al
ready been let. The material will cost
the Santa Fe just twice as much as
the steel used in the old shop, it is
said.
Work on the nt w building will com
mence just as soon as the weather
will permit, according to M. J. Drury,
superintendent of the Topeka shops.
It will be completed before summer,
although tho new forging machine
will be pressed into service while the
building is :n course of construction.

Girl's Death in Woods.
Coroner's Autopsy Repeals Poi
son Has Fatal Effect.
Chicago, Feb. 11. An autopsy per
formed late last night by the coroner's
physician on the body of Miss Marion
Frances Lambert, the 18-year-old
high school student which was found
last night in a wooded section of Lake
Forest, 111., served but to deepen the
mystery surrounding the death of the
girl. The body was found by the
girl's father.
A statement issued by the coroner
today said that enough poison had
been found in the girl's stomach to
cause death. The nature of the
poison has not been determined. De
tectives today continued their efforts
to find the man who accompanied
Miss Lambert into the woods. His
footprints were found paralleling hers
to the spot where the body was found.
From there the tracks led to the
tracks of the Chicago & Northwestern
railroad, where the trail was lost.
Peace officers have been unable to
find anything that might furnish a
motive to support either murder or
suicide theory.
MOHR HAD BIG PRACTICE
Slain Iootors Receipts fop Last Kight
Months Were $32,000.
Providence, R. I., Feb. 11. The ex
tensive practice of the late Dr. Charles
Franklin Mohr, netted him $32,225.88
from January 1, 1915, to August 81,
1915, when he was ambushed and
mortally shot in Washington road,
Barrington, while on hfs way to hid
Middletown estate with Miss Emily G.
Burger, who was also shot and ser
iously injured.
An examination of the only two
books in existence, a "red book" con
taining entries for 1914, and a "black
book" containing the receipts for 1915,
up to the time of his death, showed
that Doctor Mohr kept no record of
names of his patients and entered only
tho amounts.

KEEP WAR AT ARM'S LENGTH
But No Assurance That Flame
Won't Keach Us.
With Peace, Infinite Prosperity
Is With Us.
Washington, Feb. 11. Delegates to
the annual convention of the chamber
of commerce of the United States left
for their homes today, carrying with
them a message from President Wil
son. The outstanding feature was his
determination to keep the United
States out of the European conflict al
though he declared that the nation
merely held that trouble at arm's
length.
The president was speaking on neu
trality at the annual banquet of the
chamber, which was a concluding fea
ture of a three days convention. The
president also spoke of the need of a
real scientific tariff board and a mer
chant marine.
"It is a cruel thing, said the presi
dent, "to have it supposed, as it is in ,
many quarters, that we have kept out ;
of this war simply because we wanted
to keep out of trouble and simply be
cause we wanted to profit by the trou- j
ble of others, and yet misunderstand
ings for the time being are not to be ,
reckoned as against the consciousness
that we must ourselves have that we j
have pursued the right and only serv
iceable course. I am not afraid of the ,
slow verdict of history with regard to
the neutrality of the United States and
believe we are justified in exercising
every degree of patience in making it
clear what our position is and how
tincerely we are determined not to al
low this quarrel to become part of
ours.
Keep Judgments Cool.
"I have only this to nay, though: feVe
hold this trouble at arm's length And
keep or attempt to keep- our own
judgments cool, but the rest of the
world ie hot and it may be that any
time without our co-operation and
without . our ability to stop It, the
flame may extend to ,us. And there
fore I am glad that the United States
has been put in a position to mobilize
its1 financial resources and to get into
the position which it must at least get
into whether it wants to or not.
"If only we can keep this great na
tion at peace, there is an Infinite pros
pect of happy prosperity before the
United States."
The president spoke of the federal
reserve law saying:
"When you reflect what might have
happened if our banking system had
at the outset of this war been the
clumsy and antiquated thing that it
was three years ago. you will realize
that not only might we not have
escaped disaster, but that disaster
might have been so prolonged that it
would have been impossible for the
United States to occupy the position
she now occupies." The president
told of the necessity of a scientific
tariff board and said he thought the
nation would get it.
Once Opposed Tariff Board.
"I want to say," he continued, "that
before the whole face of affairs was
changed in the economics of the
world by the war, I was not in favor
of a tariff board because the purpose
of it then was to keep alive an un
profitable controversy. I am not in
terested in the doctrines of protec
tion; I am not interested in the doc
trine of free trade. I have been a
college professor and know why I am
not. because there is nothing in either
doctrine. The only thing that is in
teresting is the facts of commerce and
industry and the only thing that it Is
right to deduce from the fact? is some
thing" that has nothing properly to do
with party politics at all."
THREATEN TO STRIKE
Immediate Walkout of Clover Leaf
Telegraphers Is Ultimatum.
Toledo, Ohio, Feb. 11.- A strike of
all train dispatchers and telegraphers
on the Clover Leaf railroad is threat
ened within a few hours, unless the

of the Order of Railroad Telegraphers.
The strike, it is said, would include
many of the road's agents as well as
operators.
A readjustment of wages to conform

BrEtis fped to Protest
against i. Manu.
- Washington, Feb. 11. The United
States, it was stated on the highest
authority today, cannot protest the
announced sea policy of the Teutonic
powers to sink armed merchantmen
without warning.
That this government, believing the
Teutonic nations to be within their
rights in this respect, shortly will issue
a warning to all its nationals not to
travel on belligerent ships that carry
guns of any kind, seems certain.
This position must be taken, many
offiicals declared today, if America's
attitude is to continue to be logically
followed out. The American attitude
regarding arming of merchantmen, it
became known, for the first time to
day, was clearly set forth in the in
formal suggestion it recently made to
the entente powers concerning the
"absence of conditions now which in
earlier times was the excuse for arm
ing of merchantment."
How About Privates?
These reasons were, presence of
privateers and pirates on the high
seas.
None of the powers addressed. Sec
retary Lansing said today, have replied
to those suggestions. He said he as
sumed their delay was caused by ob
vious necessity of joint deliberation of
the question. The English, however,
unofficially have expressed them
selves unalterably opposed to any sug
gestion that would put their merchant
men at the mercy of the submarines.
In informal statements, high officials
of the British embassy have indicated
their belief that England and Ler
allies would never consent to this.
Despite this known opposition, it
was admitted at the state department
today one of the effects of the Teu
tonic decree will be announced that
this government will abandon its re
cent temporary ruling regarding arm
ed merchantmen, even in the event it
Is known a few German commerce
raiders are at large on the high seas,
LIVED NOT IN VAIN
Death Comes to Woman 50
Years Bedridden.
Helpless MoIIIe Fancher Gained
Wide Reputation.
New York, Feb. 11. Miss Mollie
Fancher, who celebrated her "Golden
Jubilee" as an invalid eight days ago
died today at her home in Brooklyn.
Miss Fancher was known to thousands
of people all over the world through
the extraordinary correspondence she
built up during the half century of
her invalidism. Although bedridden
and only able to move her right arm,
she worked unceasingly at knitting
and embroidery and is said to have
used up 100,000 pounds of worsted.
In 1866, when Miss Fancher was
17 years old and noted for her beauty,
she was thrown from her horse and
terribly injured. A year later she
was the victim of a street car acci
dent which deprived her of the use of
all her limbs except her right arm.
For nine years she remained in a
trance-like condition durir.g which
period her friends insisted she was a
clairvoyant. It was in these years
that she built up her correspondence,
dictating a total of 6,900 letters. Dur
ing the fifty years of her imprison
ment in a sick room Miss Fancher's
chief nourishment was the juice of
fruits.

TIMES OF STRESS
FIRE 82J1IDDIES
Secretary Daniels Indorses
Academy Board Order. ;
Xeed Men Badly,, hut Won't
Curtail Qualineations.
Washington, Feb. 1 1. Secretary
Daniels today approved the recom
mendations of the Academic board at
the naval academy dismissing 82 mid
shipmen for failure in their studies.
Their names may be made public
later.
Of those dismissed three are of the
first class, 19 of the second, 20 of the
third and 40 of the fourth class. Sec
retary Daniels said that while the
navy needed more officers, only those
who could meet the high standards
and qualify by the examination, could
be retained.
The secretary expressed regret that
the 82 students had been found "un
satisfactory in such degree as does
not justify the hope of their grad
uation and training as officers in the
navy."
Mr. Daniels said that he did not
think any midshipman should be al
lowed to graduate unless he could
make 62 Vz per cent the standard
average in his studies, and for that
reason he had refused to lower the
passing marks.
"The need of officers for the naval
service," he added "will not be met
by lowering the standard for grad
uation. New developments call for
varied ability and initiative and no
man should be commissioned who
does not meet the requirements of the
modern naval academy."

Pilot Preparedness Plan.
Washington, Feb. 1 1. Secretary
Garrison has resigned from the cabi
net because President Wilson declined
to insist without compromise upon the
adoption of the continental army plan
by congress.
The resignation was tendered and
accepted yesterday and with Mr. Gar
rison, the assistant secretary of war,
Henry C. Breckinridge, left the ser
vice of the government.
Today the president finds himself
personally in charge of the adminis
tration's plans for strengthening tho
army and working out a definite mili
tary policy. He has not selected a
successor to Mr. Garrison and it is re
garded as probable that even after
the new head of the war department
is named, the president, who has made
a careful study of the problem, will
continue to handle the prepnrednewjf
plans to a great extent himself. This
reasons for Secretary Garrison's res
ignation and its acceptance by tho
president are disclosed in lengthy cor
respondence made public between
them.
Kxtenslve Correspondence.
The correspondence revealed that
while the secretary left the cabinet
principally because the president
would not "irrevocably" support tho
continental army plan, his opposition
to the administration's program for
setting a definite time for Filipino In
dependence, as outlined In Senator
Clarke's amendment to the Philip
pine bill was an important factor.
Secretary Garrison contended that
only a federal continental army. In
stead of a recognized national guard,
could be the main military dependence
of the country while the president
contended that no one plan could be
forced upon congress. It was upon
these two contentions that the break,
between the president and the secre
tary of war came. Assistant Secretary
Breckinridge, who shared Secretary
Garrison's views, resigned because of
loyalty to his chief. His resignation
also was accepted.
Major General Scott, chief of ctaff
of the army, automatically became
secretary of war ad interim.
Prospeeta for Suecessor.
There was considerable speculation
here today over a popsible successor
to Secretary Garrison. Those talked of
most prominently in that connection
included Representative Sherley of
Kentucky, chairman of thehoue for-
Con tin iiea on 1'uge 2.
