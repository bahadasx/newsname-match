carry each week an educational
column furnished by the chair
man of education. This column
will contain terse and authorita

setting forth Lousiana's educa
tional shortcomings and the best
ways of remedying them.
The federation of Louisiana
has pledged itself to work for
edueation as a chief issue; it
should keep its pledge. Every
club in the Federation should
lend support to the chairman in
securing legislative enactment, in
awakening public sentiment. in

NOT LONG-DISTANCE JUMPERS
Fleas' Jumping Power Has Beon Ix.
aggerated, According to Recent
Investigators.
The jumping powers of fleas have
been much exaggerated. auecording to
a bulletin recently issued by the
United States department of agriculI
ture. The species known as the hu·
man Lfa (Pulex irritans) is proh
ably the host jnmper.
According to 1Mitzrnain. the maxi
mum horizontal distance this spe
cies can jump is 13 inches, and the
maximum vertical distance less than
ihei quetion of a flea's jumping
powers is of importance in connee
if tion with the spread of bubonit
s, plague and other diseases, of which
i* this insect is the carrier. The In
. dian plague commission, which has
Le investigated the habits of the Indian
dI rat flea, finds its maximum horizon
h tal jump to be only five inches, while
tU Mitzmain records the maximumn
i' height to which it can jump as 81
f, inches.
e One species of flea, the "sticl
I- tight," is nearly inoapabe of jump~
n ing.
