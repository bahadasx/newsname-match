Club Talks Over
the Coal Situation
Water Famine Also Under
Discussion at Club
Meeting
President P. B. Anderson
called a meeting of the Com
mercial Club on Monday after
noon to discuss the coal situa
tion. It seems that nothing
short of a new county division
scheme or a crisis of some kind
provides sufficient incentive for
a guod club meeting here. Mon
day's meeting was well attend
ed, by business interests and a
few ranchers. It was learned
at this meeting that the Great
North ;rn had a car of Fernie
coal which it offered to sell to
the club and after considerable
discussion John Miller was
asked to arranged to purchase
this coal and distribute a ton to
each person who made a re
quest, as long as it lasted. How
ever, Mr. Miller found it un
necessary to purchase this coal,
as a shipment came in for him
on the same evening and the
threatened famine has been
averted for the present. Secre
tary Frank VanDemark was
asked to wire the Great North
ern superintendent at Great
Falls, asking that coal shipments
to Cut Bank receive the road's
best attention hereafter.
The water situation was in
formally discussed. President
Potter and Alderman Anderson
gave it as their opinion that
persons whose hydiants were
not working at present were
free to use water from opB!iiry-|^
drants of their neighbors. Mr.
Potter stated that it would prob
ably be necessary to purchase a
new standpipe, as the pipe is
badly cracked in several places.
'The condition is extraordinary
and may not happen again for
forty years, so there is nothing
to do but be patient and strive
to make the best of conditions.
We are doing all we can for
water patrons, regardless of
cost," said Mayor Potter.

Snow, snow, beautiful snow!
What a relief from the 55 below.
Runners and sleds are in big
demand these days. And it is
hard sledging, too. But not
eearly so hard as it will be a
mong the politicians soon.
The losses among the stock
of the Reservation have been
remarkably low, considering the
severe weather. A number of
sheep and cattle however, have
succumbed.
Donnybrook fair is now being
pulled off in Washington, D. C.,
by the two antagonistic delega
tions from the reservation who
are entertaining your Uncle
Samuel with a good specimen of
a Donigal' scrap.
St. Patrick's Day in the "mar
nin" will be celebrated at the
Presbyterian Church on the
night of the 17th of March. So
it has been announced, anyway,
bugorra!
Isaac Whistler, our popular
Postmaster, has won the champ
ionship of Montana for domesti
cating of the wild. His domes
tic pet is a muskrat. Next.
The coal has arrived. The
fact accounts for the present
welcome thaw—by far more
welcome than Harry would be.
O. G. VanSenden began the
building of a barn about six
weeks ago, but lo! he is smoth
ered in the snow.
Mr. Street has returned from
Sun River to the office of the
Reclamation Service here and
will start soon to survey
around Two Medicine Lake.
He made a very impressive talk
t the Presbyterian Endeavor
Society Sunday evening.
Robert Walters and Charlie
Bust were out hunting lately,
and Charlie had part of his hand
shot away Dy an accidental dis
charge.
A son of Mr. Krieger of the
Reclamation service had both
feet badly frozen last week
while out hunting. It was thot
for a while that he might lose
his toes. The later reports are
more hopeful.
Angus Monroe is visiting at

In Rc Personal
Preparedness
There's another lesson in
what might be termed 'personal
preraredness" to be learned
from the unusual conditions
that have prevailed the past
month, due to the severity of
the winter. And it is rather
human to "pass the buck" as
the popular slang phrase ex
presses it, or in other words to
excuse our own thoughtlessness
and lay the blame elsewhere.
There has been much condem
nation of the Great Northern
for failure to make prompt coal
deliveries to different parts of
Montana, but after considering
all phases of the matter the
Pioneer Press feels in accord
with the following from the
Havre Plaindealer.
The Plaindealer holds no brief i
for the railway company, but j
its sympathy is broad enough :
to embrace that carrier as well i
as unfortunate residents along
it î line who suffer for want of
coal. Simply because the com
pany cannot perform a physical
impossibility is no just reason
why it should be universally
condemned. We live in a cold
country; ordinary winters are
sufficiently mild to permit sup
plying coal needs; until Christ- j
!
mas day the conditions were i
ideal for the laying in of a fuel
supply; and if there is suffering
now for lack of coal, it is more
the fault of the communities af
fected than of the Great North
ern railroad or any other human
agency. Whatever human suf
fering exists, could in most
cases have been avoided by due
preparation.

we received a letter from a Spo

of a raise. The writer said in
Why tke Papers
Are Getting Yellow
We all have noticed for some
time the yellow color of the
daily papers. The past week
we notice that a number of the
weeklies have turned yellow
also. This however, is not due
to cheap paper, as printers are
not guilty of cutting down ex
pense but to the fact that the
dye material is getting scarce.
On account of the war there
is no dye material being spipped
into the United States and it
cannot be obtained. However,
the poorly colored stock costs
the printer as much as the first
class goods of yesterday.—The
Browning review.
The increasing cost of print
paper, bohds, linens, envelopes
and ruled goods is one of the
grave problems confronting the
printer tdday. Print and other
papers hive recently advanced
part: "Only those directly in
the paper business can know
the tremendous difficulty that
the manufacturer is laboring
under. It seems to be getting
worse. We will try and keep
prices from going still higher
((
as long as possible,
Impossible!" Say
The Stockmen
A large number of stokmen
in the section north of Cut Bank
have called at the Pioneer Press
office within the past week to
look over the conditions of the
grazing jpermits on the Black
feet. After carefully reading
the conditions the invariable
declaratibn was "none of it in
mine." The stockmen declare
that the fencing provisions are
absurd, s^nce the fence must be
donated at the expiration of the
leasing period. A number have
stated that the only feasible
plan would be the organization
of a stoqk corporation for the
purpose of leasing and fencing
the land and for the mutual
protection of the stock.
Athletic Activity
Special Correspondence
About forty of the enterpris
ing citizens of Browning and vi
cinity have organized a night
school and are diligently study
ing the three "R's." An agri
cultural course will eventually
be added to the present course
of study. The movement is
being supported by Browning
merchants, who are offering a
number of substantial scholar
ship prizes, a complete list of
which will be published later.
On Friday evening, February
4, the Browning populace wit
nessed an interesting game of
basketball between the Black
foot town team and the Brown
ing Public School. The game
resulted in a hard earned vic
tory for Browning.
We are authorized to an
nounce the following schedule
of basketball games to be play
ed in Browning: Feb. 12, Girls'
Team. Blackfeet Boarding

JOHN S. TUCKER, Prmsidant F. H. WORDEN, CathUt
Perrine Sa>s Loss
To Date is Light
Rumors Concerning Loss
of Sheep Greatly
'Stretched'
"There is no foundation to
the rumor circulated here that
my sheep losses have been
heavy during the past week or
two" said Jas. A. Perrine to the
Pioneer Press Tuesday. 'T
credit the rumor to a herder
who left the band and came to
Cut Bank for a celebration. I
have lost a few older and weak
er animals, but the percentage
of loss to date is remarkably
light."
Mr. Perrine states that there
is plenty of feed on the reserva
tion and recently he purchased
a hundred tons of hay, as a
reserve in case the cold spell
should continue for a long
period. Those who put up a
large quantity of hay and have
a surplus are making good mon
ey this winter, he says.
Mr. Perrine seems inclined
to think that the Walsh bill, to
open the eastern edge of the
Reservation, will pass at the
coming session and appears to
have excellent reasons for this
belief. Two delegations from
the Reservation were recently
called to Washington, to present
the case, pro and con, before
Commissioner Sells. Bob Ham
ilton heads the "antis" and Mal
colm Clark is spokesman for
tho«e who favor the opening.
The Hamilton lieutenants are
Oliver Sanderville, Bird Rattler
and Chief Wolf Plume. The
Clark lieutenants are Dick San
derville, Jack Galbreath and
Mountain Chief.
"'It has always been claimed
heretofore that the agitation in
favor of this move was con
fined to a few mixed-bloods of
the more prosperous class" said
Perrine. "but this time each of
the delegations has a full-blood
Pigan chief to present the op
posing opinions and the Com
missioner ought to be able to
get a good angle on the situa
tion, from the standpoint of the
older Indians."
