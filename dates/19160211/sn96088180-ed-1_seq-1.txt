Renewed Offensive in Both
the Eastern and Western
Battle Fields, Though No
Important Resnlts Follow
Loudon, Feb. 11. Despite the
drawbacks of winter, the war Is flar
ing out anew on both the eastern and
western fronts.
Fighting that began with local at
tacks in the Artols and south of
Arras, la spreading on the western
line.
At tho same time, the Russians
have dispelled tho quiet of tho last
fow weeks and are strongly attacking
northwest of Czcrnowltz and on the
entire front from Bessarabia to Vol
hynla. The Berlin official statement today
claimed that, though the French
countered bravely northwest of Vlmy
and south of the Sommo, they had
not recaptured any more torrltory.
Tho Parla communique did not claim
any further gains last night, though
previously It had indicated the French
won considerable of the ground they
had lost,
"The French, after several hours of
artillery firing, tried four times to
regain their losses, hut failed," said
Berlin. ' .
Though both the Germans and
French attacked strongly, It was evi
dent from the official statements to
day that no Important results followed.

110 PROTEST FROM
O.S.
Washington, Feb. ll.--Th United
States can not protest the Teutonic
plan of torpedoing armed merchant
vessels, it was stated today on the
highest official authority.
. Believing that the central powers
are within their rights In pursuing
such a course, the administration
soon will warn Americana not to
travel on armed belligerent ships, it
seems certain.
. The American attitude toward arm
ing such ships was set forth in the
formal suggestion recently made to
the allies, noting the "absence of con
ditions now which in earlier times
was an excuse for arming merchant
men."
Diplomats of the central powers
here are understood to have informa
tion from the state department on
which they (base the hope that the
administration will soon disclaim re
sponsibility for Americans traveling
on armed helligerent ships.
It la believed that the British am
bassador, Sir Cecil Sprlng-RIce, will
soon take up the matter of the Ten
tonic plans Informally with Secretary
Lansing. There is no Indication in
allied diplomatic circles, however,
that the central powers' announce
ment has altered the allies' disinclin
ation to agree to disarmament
Ambassador Gerard reported to the
state department today that he had
received the proclamation of Ger
many's intention to war on armed
merchant Teasels.
TROUBLE FOR U. S.
(By United Press Leased Wire)
London, Feb. 11. Issues as grave
as the Lusitanla case may arise be
tween the United States and the cen
tral powers officials declared here to
day, as the result of the Teutonic
announcement of intent to attack
armed merchant vessels.
The entente allies do not yield the
right to arm such vessels for defen
sive purposes, a practice universally
recognized. Moreover, they do not
believe that, the United States having
recognized this right, will change her
policy in the midst of the war. though
she has suggested disarmament of
such ships to the entente allies.
Authorities here believe that the
United States would take prompt and
decisive action In the event that an
Austrian or German submarine tor
pedoed an armed allied liner carry
ing American passengers.
Uhder headings like "A New Plea
for Piracy," the British newspapers
today declared that the Germans, af
ter seeming to yield in the Lnsl-
tanla case, are embarking on a new
campaign o "frlghtfulness.' In dis
regard of law and humanity. They
expressed the view that the Teutonic
announcement r&upens the German-
American dispute.
