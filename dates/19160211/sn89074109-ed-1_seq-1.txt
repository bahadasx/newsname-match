An enthusiastic turn-out of'
iarmers. representing all por
tions of 4he Golden Valley
greeted H. E. Behrens and
8. Moore, of Fargo, Non-Par
tisan League lecturers, at a
big booster meeting which
jtook place in the Beach opera
house Tuesday afternoon.
Though the day wai3 disagre
eable and the roads all over the
county in many place nearly
iirjpassable because of the
heavy drifts of snow, the op
era house wias filled to capa
city, many comjing from a dis
tance of thirty miles to be pre
sent.
There is nothing that is vis
ionary or impracticable in the
tjbnets of the Norn-Partisan
league organization the speak
ers said unless a platform de
dicated to the code of human
justice, tihe cause of the peo
ple can be termed visionary.
It is visionary just so long as
present political conditions
are held in tolerance and en
dured by a class at present
w&thout adequate representa
tion in the legislation of the
state. It is to fill this need
that the League, now less than
six months old was organized.
jTioday. more than 40.000 far
mers are actively enrolled in
membership.
It was inevitable, of course,
that the league and its purpo
ses slhould be attacked by hos
tile inteests through a subsid
ized press, which saw the reins
of state government which they
controlled jeopardized by the
"pernicious" activity of the
farmer class. So bitter was
this opposition, and so insidi
ous were the methods employ
ed, that they had the opposite
effect of that which they
were intended, instead serving
to remove the cob-webs of un
certainty which fogged the vi
sion of doubting ones. Today
the membership is growing by
leaps and bounds, in some
counties comprising as high as
•ninety per cent of the farmers,
and the League has become a
very real factor to be reckoned
wftth the coir.fing state elec
tion and for the farmer his
"place in the sun," where
stalls legislation is concerned.
Tihe speakers impressed up
on their hearers that there was
no secret, no plans enshrouded
in mystery, involved in the
plans and purposes of the Lea
gue, which are.* briefly stated

Applause greeted the speak
er upon declaring that inas
/.much as the farmer numerical
ly pays three fourths of the tax
les of the state, he should be
entitled to at least three-fourths
representation in the legisla
tion of its laws. He declared
that the laws governing the
majority should be made by
the majority, with due res
pect for the rights of the min
ority, and the elimination of
mere "money-bags" politics
having for its purpose the pur
chase of immunity, and seek
ing to subsidize the public
counts.
The charge that the Non
partisan League Was being
built up by men who seek to
land themselves in office in
dignently refuted by the speak
er. wtho said that the men who
started and built up the or
ganization are at work to put
the government of North Da
kota in the hands of the peo
ple of North Dakota—not to
grab office for themselves.
The League has a greater mis
sion than that of chasing pub
lic office—that of breaking
up gang rule, and the build
ing up of a farmers' organi
zation to enable them to se
cure the legislation to which
they are en tolled. The Far
mers, he stated, will select
their candidates from among
themselves—not from Lea
gue officials, and the farmers'
candidates Will be the Leagues'
candidates. In the meantime
I'le league has not endorsed an
candidate and will not until its
members have met in state
convention, and made their
own selection.
It is interesting to note that

out the State who were active
in ridiculing the organization
•^e row actively for it, a not

State meetings are being

gue is conducting a vigorous
and aggressive campaign is

Cartier anid wife arrived from
the Zenith vicinity a few days
ago, and have commenced suit
against William Carleton of
Belfiield. on whose farm, lo
cated seven miles north of
Zenith, they have resided since

that he made a deal with Mr.
Carleton last fall to rent the
farm and moved there with
his wife. He was unable to
secure a contract, however,
although he requested one
weeks ago. It is alleged that
Carleton went out to the farm
and turned Mr. and Mrs. Car
ter cut of the place, and in go
ing to the house of a neighbor.
Mrs. Carter froze her feet
quite badly. Cartier also al
leges that his landlord turned
his chickens from the coop and
shut the door, leaving the
chickens out in the snow.
Now Mr. Cartier sues for
wages. Attorneys Murtha and

After Fortune
Bright and early this morn
ing the editor om the Monitor
received a telegram from New
York City sent by James Col
vin the Qlendive Saddlery
Co's manager, which read
as follows: "Keep cases on
Lapand."
Fom this short and pithy
message we take it that we are
expected to keep our report
orial eyes on the ship he is
traveling on to the old country,
no doubt the Lapland, one of
the Scandinavian liners. He
no doubt expects us to prom
ptly report to our readers any
accidents, mine catastrophies,
or submarine attacks which the
ship may meet (with in the
course of its tiavels to the for
eign shore and this we will sur
ely do.
Mr. Colvin left the city last
Saturday after having receiv
ed word from Scotland that he
had fallen heir to an extensive
estate through the death of a
wealthy relative in the war.
Whether or not the estate is
worth the trip in view of the
danger a vessel is in while trav
eling in the war zone, we are
not prepared to say. No doubt
Mr. Colvin thinks so, but as
for us. fortune or mo fortune,
the old USA would be by far
the best in these troublous

NUMBER 14
One of tihe saddest accidents
ZZZZTZTy
of this paper to chronicle oc
curred last Monday afternoon
when Harry Kranick lost his
life as the result of a cave-in
cf the coal mine on the John
Denton farm near Burkey.
Mr. Kranick was a well
known aind promiinent young
farmer in the Alpha-Burkey
country and had gone to the
mine to get a load of coal. We
understand that he was assist
ing the miners and others get
the coal out wlhen the acci
dent happened. It seems that
eit the time of the caveinhe was
in the mine alone and for that
reason Was the only victim of
the catastrophe. Although"
those present at the time put
forth every ounce of strength
and esnergy in their efforts to
get him out from, under the
immense amount of coal and
dirt that had buried him it took
them almost fifteen minutes
and wlhen they got to him he
was dead, death presumably
being caused by suffocation.
Harry Kranick was born at
Peildcan Rapids. Minn.. on the
20 of October 1888. He came
to North Dakota with his fath
er and brothers and sisters in
1903. He lived north of Beach
with his father until 911
when he was unObsd iin marri
age to Mayme White. In 1912
he moved to his farm twenty
Wiles south of Beach where
he has resided ever since.
Harry was a man among
men in the full sense cf the
word. He was highly respected
by all Viiho knew him and hiis
untimely death is mourned not
only by relatives but by scores
of friends and acquaintances
in this and other communities.
He leaves to mourn their
loss, a loving wife and a four
year-old son a fatfoer,Thomas
Kranick one brother, Rlalph
Kranick, and two sisters. Mrs.
Wm. Zabel and Mrs. Sam
Wise. They are all residents
of Golden Valley county.
Funeral services were con
ducted in the Methodist church
here this afternoon. Rev. Ira
Hammer officiating. Inter
ment was made in the city
cemetery. Out of respect for
the. deceased the business
places of the city closed their
doors at noon today and did
ndfc re open untfl after the
cbsepUies.
To the heart-broken wiie,
son and other relatives is' ex
tended the sympathy cf the
entire community in this their
hour of sorrow.
Reverend Treanklein, pastor
of the German Lutheran
•church, has been under the
weather for the past twio weeks
but is rapidly recovering at
this Writing.
Mr. and Mrs. A. D. Lo
