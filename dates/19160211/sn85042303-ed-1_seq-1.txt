CRIMINAL TERM OF DISTRICT
COURT WILL BE CONVENED.
HERE FEBRUARY 23 PEOPLE
"CHICKEN-HEARTED."
"The court of inquiry is still in ses
sion," said Judge Freeman of the dis
trict court, yesterday afi.'rnoon, "and
will remain in session as lung as the
Ht-ahttnn field is doin; business."
Continuing. Judge Freeman .-aid: "1
saw in l he p ipers where the people
of Wirt were appealing the gover
nor for protection in :h" field, an.!
I thought the civil authorities of this
county -.nre able to take care of the
affair.- of the ioumi.v and in gi.e pro
tection l.) the people, and I saw :i"
necessity ,f any declanr ion of mar
tial law :: Healdton "
The January term of district court
which was to have convened on the
sixMi of J.muarv, wa continued un
til an investigation was made of the
oil field violations. About 2". arrests
have be.-n mnl- growing out of the
iniuir. , and other arrests Mill be
made. The term of district court
will ! convened on the 2s'h of this
mop.'h. The court has ordered a jury
drawn and the regular criminal cases
for !. January term and also the
new case- arising since tha' time will
he tried.
Judge Freeman says he knows the
people of Carter county d not ap
prove law violations in the Healdton
field or at any oilier place, but since
he convened the court of inuuiry. not
a maj: has come to him to give ap
proval of his course, and he has de
cided if the people of the county are
for law enforcement that they are
mighty chicken-hearted about it. He
says the strong arm of the state has
been sent In Tulsa to try to clean up
that city, and the same conditions
w ill prevail here if the people do not
guard their own Interests and keep
down violations. Tulsa is enforcing
the law better. Oklahoma City has
become more active in prosecutions,
and those cities are driving an un
desirable element out of there, and if
the people here are lax they will
come fhis way, as the oil fields are
active, and many hundreds of men
are employed at good wages and
money is plentiful.

he would keep the roads which he
crosses in good condition. The peti
tion also asked for the right of build
ing a telephone line to run parallel
with the pipe lines and this right
was also granted.
It is understood that Mr. Hamon
has already made purchases of pipe
and other supplies, and he will soon
be at work on the construction of the
line. The oil and gas from the Ha-mon-Colcord
lease in section
will be run through the proposed

WITH RESIGN ATI ION OF GARRIS
ON AND HIS ASSISTANT, PRESI
DENT HAS ARMY PLANS.
scon is
Major General Scott Automatically Be
comes Secretary of War, Until Gar
rison's Successor is Named Looks
Like Lane or Rosevelt for Place.
Washington. IV C, Feb. 11 Presi
dent Wilson today finds himself per
sonally in charge of the administra
tion's plans for strengthening the ar
my, following the resignations last .
night of Secretary of War Garrison
and Assistant Secretary Breckenridge.
The reasons for Garrison's resigna
tion are disclosed in '.he lengthy cor
respondence which revealed his op
position to the Philippine measure,
in which a definite time was set for
independence and because President
Wilson would not "irrevocably" sup
port the continental plan, llreckeii
ridge resigned on account of loyalty to
his chief.
.Major General Hugh L. Scott, chief!
of staff, automatically becomes secre
tary of war ml interim. Secretary ot
Interior Lane, and Assistant Secretary
of Navy, ltoosevelt, are mentioned a
successors to Garrison. The presi
dent will probably make the appoint
ment of a successor immediately.
Garrison's resignation was a com
plete surprise to Washington officials
generally. Several hours before the of
ficials announcement, he had boarded
a train with bis wife for New York,
and word had been given out at tha
department that he had gone for an
Indefinite stay.
It is known that one of Secretary
Garrison's principal reasons for his
conviction that only a federal conti
nental army instead of a reorganized
national guard could be the main mili
tary dependence of the nation was his
belief that some day the United States
muy be called upon to defend the Mon
roe Doctrine, and in that event he fore
saw the national guard might not be
available for use outside of the United
States before a declaration of war.
Upou the contention on the one hand
that the continental army or ultimate
ly universal service was the nation's
only reliance, and the position on the
other that no one plan could be en
forced upon congress, President Wit
son and his Secretary of War parted,
official company.
Secretary of Agriculture Houston,
of Texa, is also considered as a
probable successor to Garrison.
Done With Public Life.
New York, Feb. 11. Former Secre.
tary of War Garrison announced here
today that he intended to retire abso
lutely from public life and politics,
lie would not discuss his resignation
from a political angle.
Garrison intimated that he might
"do something," in giving support to
the continental army movement. He
denied that he would oppose Wilson
like Ilryan did.
