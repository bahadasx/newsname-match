FLOOD DANCER RELIEVER
The kindness of the elements has
relieved to a great extent the danger
Of high water in Pullman, and It is
believed that not enough snow no*
remains on the ground to cause a
great amount of damage, even
should it melt rapidly. Much appre
hension was felt for several days, as
a sudden melting of the heavy blan
ket of snow would undoubtedly have
overtaxed the channel of the creek,
but the thaw was gentle and the
South Palouso has, iip to the pres
ent time, taken care of its added
burden without overflowing.
Yesterday morning the creek was
swollen to a considerable extent, but
the blowing out with dynamite of a
big ice jam relieved the situation,
Much of the frost has been drawn
from the ground under the moder
ated weather conditions, and it is
probable that the soil will absorb a
large amount of the moisture.
GRAIN PRICES DOWN.
drain quotations are steady, with
a downward tendency and no sales

score of 28 to 17 in favor of the

PULLMAN. WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY If, 1916
Six Cows Net $63 in One Month
Nearly One-third of Dairy Animals
in Honor list of Cow Testing
Association Owned by C. 11.
Barclay of Pullman
Six cows In the dairy herd of C.
11. Barclay, the Pullman dairyman,
produced over 16 pounds of butter
fat during the month of January, ac
cording to the tabulations of the
hitman County Cow Testing asso
ciation for that month, and each of
the six animals was given a place in
the association honor roll lor the
month, The average production of
the six cows was 5 4.8 pounds of fat,
which, taken at current market
prices, was worth over $16, while
the cost of feed averaged $5. 1 for
each animal, leaving the owner a
net profit of $10.03 for each cow, or
$63.78 for the six cows during the
month. This record is considered
an exceptional one for this time of
lie- year.
The ration for Mr. Barclay's herd
consisted of alfalfa hay, corn silage
and about lo pounds of a grain mix
ture, of equal parts rolled oats, brail
and shorts. This is a ration that
an he recommended to anyone feed
ing cows for profit, according to A.
J. Lashbrook. field agent in dairy
ing, ami tin: record made by the
Pullman dairyman would bear out
the statement. Numerous others of
Air. Barclay's cows were close to the
honor mark, and it is doubtful if a
better producing herd can be found
In Whitman county. All of the si
cows above the 45-pound mark were
llolsteins, although the local man
has several blooded Jerseys in his
herd.
Farmers who say winter dairying
does not pay and that cows can not
lie' mads to produce well in cold
weather, will do well to look over
the records made in the Whitman
County Cow Testing association dur
ing the month of January. Noel
Buchanan, official tester and "cow
detective" for the association, re
ports that a total of 39 cows pro
duced over 40 pounds of butter-fat
during the month, and the 20 listed
here above 4 5 pounds.
The "Honor Roll"
Buttercup, a Holstein, owned by
C. H. Barclay of Pullman, produced
1730 pounds of milk that tested 3.7
per cant butter-fat, amounting to 64
pounds.
Lady, a Jersey, owned by L. N.
Chase of Palouse, produced 1299
pounds of milk that tested 4.9 per
cent, or 63.6 pounds of butter-fat.
University Refuses 1916 Game
All Athletic Relations Between the
Schools Off as Result of Refusal
to Play
After the Washington State Col
lege had complied with every condi
tion demanded by the University of
Washington to secure a rootball game
between the two teams that rank as
the best on the Pacific coast, the uni
versity athletic board Saturday night
backed down in its position and re
fused to grant a game. The board
authorized the publishing as their
reason the declaration that to grant
I Washington State a game would con
flict with the university's policy of
limiting the number of games and
j trips on the schedule.
J. F. Bohler, athletic director, on
Sunday morning received the fol
lowing telegram carrying notice of
the university's refusal to play:
"J. F. Bohler, Pullman, Wash.:
Board of control declined offer of
Washington State College for foot
ball game on the ground that it
would not be In accord with our ath
letic policy of number of games and
trips. Letter follows. J. A. Young
er."
The action of the university board
and the advancing of such a reason
for their refusal to play the Pacific
coast champions is perfectly in line
with the schedule-petting policy of
the university during the past eight
years. Indignation over the policy
crystallized during the 1915 season

The association work for the first
year will conclude with the February
records, at which time the total year
ly records and costs of feeding can
be reckoned up. Much interest is
being shown in the work as there
are a number of cows competing for
high honors in the association. Most
of the memebrs feel well repaid for
the year's testing work and practic
ally all of them are expecting to con
tinue the work for another year.
Several other dairy linen of the
county are planning to join in the
good work for 1916.
among students at Seattle and fans
throughout the Northwest, but the
adverse sentiment appears to have
had little effect on the athletic board
of the Seattle school.
"All of our athletic relations with
Washingtoi: are off," stale! Ore"
Bohler, athletic director, following
his receipt of the telegram Horn
Younger. "Wo have gone more than
hall way in an attempt i.i g-ot the
game wPn th., university and iluy
have backe.l tit wn. We sl.ali do
nothing more to secur* i renewal
of relations. Our schedule shows
that we worn 1 be put under a far
greater handicap than the univers

offered to do it in order to stop the
bickering that has bee.i going on.
Th. university has shown its band.
They are :tli; i I to play us an I 1
have long realized it."
Keen disappointment and indigna
tion is felt on the- campus over tne
failure to secure the game with
Washington. W. S. C. students were
of the opinion that after the athletic
council had gone the limit, meeting
all demands of the Seattle school ami
agreeing to place the team under an
unpopular handicap to secure the
contest, the Washington manage
ment would lack the temerity »o le
fuse to schedule a game.

the college, spent the week-end with
Mr. and Mrs. Martin J. Maloney at
Colfax.
