CLOVIS. CURRY COUNTY, NEW MEXICO. FEBRUARY. 11. 1916.
$1.00 PER YEAR
NEW CHRISTIAN CHURCH HAS
GREAT DEDICATORY SERVICE
Last Sunday was the Greatest Day in the History of
Local Church. All-day Service with Luncheon
Draws Immense Throng. Nearly $1800 raised.
Thirteen Additions to the Church during day.
Sunday, February 6. 1916 will
be remembered by the members
of the Christian church of Clovis
so long as memory sets on her
throne. It was really, truely a
great day, a high day, a red
letter day, not only for the
members of that church but for
the whole of Clovis. The day
was ideal as to weather con
tlitions. Just warm enough to
he comfortable and cool enough
to be invigorating.
The services of the day began
promptly at 9:45 a. m. with a
rousing good Sunday-school.
This waa 3 fitting prelude to the
great services that were to fol
low, and did follow, joyously,
harmoniously, without a hitch.
At 11 a. m. Evangelist Arthur
W. Jcnes preached a soul-grip-;iing
and soul-stirring sermon on
"Why be a Christian." At the
conclusion of the sermon Reven
united with the church. Evan
gelist Jones then called for
money to finish paying for the
church edifice, and in a short
time about $t. W(J was subscrib
A lunch was served in the
larc'e baipment of the building
at the noon hour to a host of
members and friends in and out
of the city.
At 3 p. m. the communion and
a great social service was held.
This proved to be one of the
happy events of the day. Those
present were given an oppor
tunity to express their senti
ments with regard to the big
new church building and the
work in general. Many and
heartening were the addresses
by both the members and friends
present.
A large number of extra seats
were pressed into use for the
exooing sprvii'e. Even the
standing room was at a pre
mium. It is estimated that be-
hood, the higher and better
things of life.
The Christian church was or
ganized in 1908 by Frederick F.
Grimm. J. T. Webb was the
first pastor, followed by J. New
ton Cole, W. R. Quiggin, J. H.
Shepard and C. VV. Lambert,
the present minister, who de
serves the greatest credit pos
sible for bringing to a glorious
consumation this magnificent
enterprise. The new church
building has cost between $0000
and $7000, is modern in all its
appointments and would be a
credit to a town several times
the size of Clovis

V w
tween 500 and 00 people were
present. lOvangelist Jones de
livered a splendid sermon on
"Why we build this Church."
Five more united with the
church. A call was again made
fur more money with which to
finish p;iing f.r the building.
Ire necessary amount was
quickly raised and arranged for.
After which the dedicatory ser
vice proper followed. This was
a splendid culmination to all the
excellent services of this never
to be-forgotten day. The dedi
catory vows were read by the
congregation. Pastor Clark W.
Lambert leading in his own im
pressive way. Dr. Jeremiah
Moore, pastor of the Presby
terian church, offered a fei vent
dedicatory prayer. Rev. Messer

Ol. uiu uiriumiinb tnuri.il xpufte,
in thn mnt hmnv PhriKtian
spirit, words of greeting for his
and other churches of the city.
Hev. Milton Reese, of the Bap
tist church led the opening
prayer of the evening. All the
churches of Clovis dismissed
their evening services for the
occasion and it was truly a mag
nificent audience of men and
women, boys and girls, who, for
the most part, were reaching
out after those things that make
for real manhood and woman-
The above is a tairly good like
ness of Clark W. Lambert, min
ister of the Christian church of
this city. We use the word
"fairly" advisedly, for the
above picture does not d this
man of God justice. It makes
him appear a bit too boyish.
whereas he is every Inch a man,
in brain, brawn, muscle, heart,
soul and avoirdupois. ' He stands
six feet two in his sock feet, and
be it known unto all the people
that this minister has worn
socks mostly continuously since
the good New Year of our Lord
nineteen hundred and sixteen
made its advent, for it was about
this time that the members of
his congregation pounced down
upon him with a most unmerci
ful pounding. Among the ar
ticles hurled at him were four
teen, more or less, pairs of socks.
Minister Lambert is long and
stalwart in body, heart, soul and
mind, lie is careful, prudent,
determined; a plodder who gets
there; a dreamer who forces his
dreams to enme true; a man who
plans his work, then works his
plans: a man of courage in
domitable and faith sublime.
The impossible tasks are the
one he delighcs to tackle. As
evidence of this see the costly
church edifice just completed in
this city.
Clark W. Lambert was born
amidst the hills of Arkansas,
educated in the Blue Grass sec
tion of Kentucky, and is doing
his most wonderful work on the
sunkissed plains of New Mexico.
He is a man among men, a
prince, a sun-crowned Christian
gentleman.

CLOVIS SALOONS TO CLOSE
DOORS ON MARCH TENTH
At a Meeting of the City Council This Week it Was
Ordered that Clovis Thirst Parlors Go Out of
Business March 10th in Compliance With the
Wishes of the Majority of Our Citizens.
A Flourishing
Home Institution
We learn this week that the
New Mexico Mutual Life and
Aid Association is making good
and solid strides forward. The
membership is now about 500,
more than 100 being added since
the first of the year. As evi
dence that care is taken in the
selection of the members, it is
stated that not a death has oc
curred among the members
since the organization of the
Association some ten months
ago.
This is a home institution,
backed by home people, and for
home people. The purpose of
the organization is to furnish
protection, in the way of insur
ance at actual cost to the mem
bers.
Mr. C. C. Baker is the secre
tary and general manager and
Mr. H. E. Baker the general
organizer, it is believed that
this institution will prove a
great boon to many hundreds of
our people, because the protec
tion it affords is within the
reach of everyone, regardless of
his or her financial condition.
Mrs. Tucker Hostess
The Bridge Whist Club was
graciously entertained at the
home of Mrs. Joe Tucker Friday

journed all voting a word of
thanks to their hostess for her
pleasant hospitality.
John Boppenmeytr Dead
Mr. John Boppenmeyer, a
workman in the car repairing
department of the Santa Fe
shops, died suddenly at his home
in the west part of town last
Saturday night, February 5th.
Heart failure was the supposed
cause of his death. He was
nearly fifty nine years old but
apparently in good health. He
went about his work during the
day; read his paper until about
9:30 that night and retired with
out complaint. In a few minutes
there was a struggle for breath
and he was dead before a light
could be made.. Funeral ser
vices conducted at the home at
2:30 Monday afternoon by C. W.
Lambert were followed by in
terment at the Clovis Cemetery.
Mr. Boppenmeyer is survived by
two brothers, one sister, a wife,
and three children. The Modern
Woodmen of America, the Mac
cabees and a multitude of other
friends are extending their full
est sympathies to the bereaved
ones.
I. T. Moore, who recently pur
chased 25 head of good grade
white face heifers from Dunn
and Harrison of Farwell, Texas,
through J. H. Shepard of Clovis,
added a registered male to his
bunch this week, bought from
the same company.
Miss Daisy Rainbolt has re
turned to Clovis and will again
enter the millinery business.
Miss Rainbolt needs no intro
duction, having engaged in the
millinery business here before
and is well known. She will
display an unusual amount of
late nifty hats that will suit the
most fastidious. Miss Rainbolt
says she intends to make an at
tractive price on her hats as an
advertisement. Her establish
ment will be located in the
Reidoria Sample room.
At a meeting of the City
Council this week it was ordered
that the saloons should close
their doors here March 10 in
compliance with the recent pro
hibition election, which pat
Clovi9 in the dry ranks by a
majority of 64.
While we do not know, but we
believe the present saloon men
will, at least, show their good
sense and best judgement by
complying with the wishes of
the majority of Clovis citizen
ship.
When the Clovis saloons close
their doors here we naturally
expact, for a very short period
of time, a little ruffle cn thm
surface of the business here,
but it will be only momentary,
after which we confidently ex
pect all legitimate lines of busi
ness to become stronger.
We feel that it is the bounden
duty of every person who loves
Clovis, to not only see to it that
the prohibitory law is enforced
to the letter, but to lend his help
in making Clovis bigger and
oetttr than ever before, and to
this end each one should vie witli
everyother one in trying to have
every building made vacant on
March 10 by the going from us
forever of the open saloon, filled
at once with some line of legiti
mate business, or if the present
occupants of these several build
ings desire to remain with us
and go into some other line of
business, every citizen in our
fair city should give him, or
them, his hearty encouragement.
That we will have an occasion
al violation of the prohibitory
law, goes without saying. Every
law on the statute bosk is some
times violated. Several things
are necessary to the enforce
ment of any law, howeyer whole
some that law may be. We
must have officers who have the
courage and moral stamina to do
their whole duty. Then we
must have a strong sentiment on
the part of the citizenship in
favor of the law. These two
conditions certainly obtain here
in Clovis. Hence the bootlegger
who is expecting to ply his un
holy trade here had better hie
himself away to the tall timbers,
otherwise he is most apt to find
himself peeping through iron
bars. So mote to be.
Seed Station and Farm
J. M. Rozzell, who recently
moved to Clovis from Chilicothe,
Texas, contemplates putting in
a goverment seed station and
experiment farm at this place.
Mr. Rozzell is an experienced
seedsman and feels that he will
be able to make a great success
with the undertaking. He has
a number of varieties of seed
that he will test out and his ex
periments should prove of much
value to farmers of this section.
The man who can make two
blades of grass grow where only
one grew before, is a real bene
factor. This, as we understand
it, is somewhat of the character
of the work Mr, Rozzell will
undertake in our midst
