RESOLUTIONS OFFERED TO
AMEND PRIMARY LAW
MAY 23RD IS SUGGESTED
AS DATE FOR THE SPRING PRIMARY
TO BE HELD AND FILINGS WILL
BE MADE ACCORDINGLY
Pierre, S. D., Feb. 11.—The hoase
oonvened in speoial session at 10 a
m. Tuesday, and the senate went into
session at 10:30 a. m.
March of Hughes county offered a
resolution that the organization of the
hoase of the 1915 session be made per
manent for the special session, which
was adopted.
The hoase met in joint Mestion with
the senate at 11 a. m., to listen to the
reading of the message from the gov
ernor, which referred to the calling of
the special session, and stating that
the legislature might pass other mat
ters at the special session, other than
that specified in the oall.
A recess was taken until 9 p. m., in
order to give the committees time to
assemble.
At the evening session four bills
were introduced and passed to their
seoond reading.
In his message to the joint bodies
the governor, after having stated the
law empowering him to convene the
legislature in extraordinary session,
said, in part:
"The primary election law fixes the
date of the biennial primary election
as the first Tuesday in June, which this
year falls on the sixth. The National
convention of the republican party is
called to meet in Chioago on the 7th of
June, the day following the primary
election. The national convention of
the democratic party meets in St,
Louis on the 14th, one week later. It
is oertain that delegates cannot be
elected at our primary election on June
sixth, the resolt of the election ascer
tained and oertifled in time that such
delegates may be feeated in the con
vention held June 7th. It is very
doubtful if delegates can, on that date
be legally selected, oertifled, and ore
dentialed in time for the convention
which meets June 14th and it is oer
tain they cannot if it should happen
that there woald be a olose oontest in
the primary.
"Section 84 provides: "In oase the
national politioal convention of any
political party has been called to
meet at a date too early to allow the
delegates to the same from this state
to be eleoted at the Jane primary a
primary for the election of such dele
gates shall be held on the first Tuesday
in April.'
"In view of the provisions of the
primary election law and the date of
the national convention, it BeemB clear
that we are confronted with the
emergency contemplated by the law in
the provisions for holding a primary
eleotion in April for eleoting delegates
to national conventions. While the
terms of the law providing for
April primary in this emergency
clear and unequivocal, and, in
opinion, each that if the request
declaration found in subdivision of 3
of seotion 6 is offered, such request
and declaration will be accepted and
filed by the proper state officers,. the
filing certified to the oounty authorities
Mid the April primary invoked, the
provisions for holding such primary
•lection and the methods of prooedure
•re not so dear, There are defeots and
discrepancies in the law. I will not
say that any of these defects are neces
sarily fatal, bat they are such as to
render the holding of the April pri
mary at least doubtful and, aside
from and in addition to this, the wis
dom of holding two primaries, with the
attendant expense and inconvenience
to the voters, when one can be made to
answer better, is open to serious ques.
tlon. It is to remedy this situation I
have oalled you together.
"In addition to adjusting the date
for holding the primary eleotion, sub
division 1 of seotion 6. should be
•mended so as to make it clear that the
signatures required on petitions filed
for candidates for congress shall be
based on the vote oast in the congres
sional district in qaestlon and not the
entire state."

TO IMPROVE RURAL BUILDINGS
Art Professor Will Help Make South Dakota
Farms More Attractive
Vermillion, Feb. 11—The rural
homes of Sooth Dakota sboald be at-
\.w\ *0 ,v-V
tractive as well as oomfortable, says
Professor Rossiter Howard of the art
department of the University of South
Dakota, who since joining the Univer
sity last fall, has been devoting time to
the study of the rural arohiteoture of
South Dakota. He is planning a cam
paign of education in the state for
rural buildings that will combine the
qualities of usefulness and beauty and
that will adapt themselves to South
Dakota conditions. With this end in
view Professor Howard is working on a
series of stereoptioon lectures on rural
architecture whinh he intends to give
in the state.
The art department will not under
take single-handed the task of develop
ing the rural architecture of South
Dakota. The department of home
economics and the College of Engineer
ing are giving assistance on questions
of house planning and the structural
problems of house building. Professor
Howard has been getting material also
from Washington and the east, and
from neighboring states, where work
along these lines has been done,
Professor Howard has recently re
turned to the United States from
France, where he spent several years
as art lecturer for the Bureau of Uni
versity Travel. An art department, he
says, should not be merely concerned
with pictures. It 6hould get in touch
with the state where there is the
greatest need. He feels there is a great
field in South Dakota in helping plan
more attractive homes.

"If Mars the god of war is at all sen

Not one of the five speakers of the

to Bay of him and his methods. Franois
Case, of Hot Springs with his oration
entitled "Man to Man" took first plaoe
and Leslie Caldwell, of Alexandria,
with
hiB
oration entitled "America's
Opportunity" ranked seoond in the
contest. Mr. Case spoke of peace and
patriotism, saying that if a vote were
taken of the young men of the oountry
as to whether they wanted war or not
the majority would, undoubtedly vote
for peace, and yet should an invading
army land upon our shores tomorrow,
this same majority would enlist to de
fend their country's honor ."

Another hand is beckoning us,
Another oall is given
And gloom oijoe more with angel steps
The path wh'ioh reaches heaven.
The light of her young life went down,
As sinks behind the hill
The glory of a setting star
Suddenly and still.
As pure and sweet, her fair brow.
Seemed eternal BB the sky
And like the brook's low song, her voioe
A sound which could not die.
Fold her Father, in Thine arms
And let her henceforth be
A messenger of love between
Our human hearts and Thee.
—Whittier.
Mrs. Patterson leaves to mourn her

her husband, her father and mother,

THOROUGHLY AWAKE
George Schlosser While In the Hills Recently
Discovered a New Spirit Abroad
Interviewed by The Journal on bis
trip to the Black Hills. Mr. Schlosser
stated that there was a united de
termination from every quarter in the
Black Hills to get together and make
191G a reoord year. They are well or
ganized with a federated association of
Commercial clubs from all the towns
and are going to be in shape to show
the scenic beauty and to convince the
tourists of the wonderful and exhilarat
ing climate and curative value of the
numerous mineral waters Bowing so
bountifully from the mountains about
Hot Springs.
To do all this there is to be a plan
worked out for special side trips some
thing after the Wiley way of seeing
Yellowstone Park, so that when the
tourist leaves his home he can figure
exactly on the oost of his outing and
know that he is to be provided with a
guide thoroughly familiar with all the
points of interest and who wilt cee to
it that no one leaves dissatisfied, as
they propose to see that the rrice of
this service shall be within reach of
those with moderate means.
A complete set of colored slides have
been made for advertising purposes,
and these are to be 6ent cut free. Mr.
Schlosser has already filed application
for their exhibition in this city and
they will efford a pleesent evenitg's
entertainment, without cost when they
come to be 6hown here.
An innovation in the geccrel plan to
induce tourists is to be worked out
through a paid representative who will

and a special effort made to have South
Dakotanssee "South Dakota First."
The railroads will co-operate in the
movement and render a faultless, ser
vice. The hotels and rooming houses'^
will all slick up and give a first olass
service at moderate oost. The resorts,
of whioh there are many, will be brush
ed up, and those who from frequent
visits are familiar with the surround
ings and in the past may have had oo
oasion to complain, will be surprised'
this Meason to see the spirit of thrift
abroad throughout the Hills distriot
looking to the beautifying of one of
natures romatio play grounds. A spe
oial committee is already at work on
good roads leading into and through
the Hills oountry. Speoial county
funds are being raised and the work of
making it possible for auto tourists to
enjoy themselves forever after on
maoadem highway within the Hills is'
no idle dream."
To all of this The Journal would like
to say that eastern South Dakota owes
it to the Black Hills and a spirit of oo-'
operation should be manifest among'
those who anually take a short sum
mer outing to spend their time end
money at home. "Seeing South Da
kota First," is a pretty good slogan
for 1916.—Sioux Falls Journal.
