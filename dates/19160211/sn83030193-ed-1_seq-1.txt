I.indlcy M. Garrison, who suddenly
....tslgned us Secretary of War yestor
day and came Immediately to New
York City, broke hid self-imposed
nHcnco to-day noon vnd said to a
reptcscntntlvc of Tlio livening
Worlds '
"I do not intend to discus In anyj
way tho circumstances, mid conditions
that led up to my resignation. The let
tern that passed between tho I'rosl
dent nnd myself speak for themselves
and I am going to let tho case ro-t
upon them.
"My notion tt-.m based Hololy upon
principle and conviction. I would bo
Jiorry Indeed to 'have uny one think
that thoro was tho slightest degrco of
pique or personality entering Into It.
That certainly was furthest from my
thought.
"I have nothing to add or to tako
away from my views on tho subject
of national preparedness as expressed
In tho correspondence. They will
continue to bo my opinions on this
Important question. I have been
urged to becomo an nctlvo advocate
of tho cause1, but I have no desire to
press myself on tho public. I cannot
eoncolvo of my taking tho utump
ugalnst tho President.
"My intent nnd deslro Just now Is
to retlro from political life, become a
private citizen and resume the prac
ttco of law- I am out of politics.
Some persons have ivskod me whether
I am to bo a candldato for Governor
of Now Jersoy. My answer Is that I
am not. I am mX a candidate for
that otllce or any other olllce, and
would not aocept If eleoted.
"I have come over here to New
York without uny definite plans for
the future except to go to practic
ing law again after twelve yearn In
public office and try now to earn a
living for myself and wlfo nnd to lay
up aomethlng for tho future. I don't
know whero I shall set up my otflco,
whether In New York or In New
Jersey. Already several persona navo
been kind enough to tempt me with
Invitations and offers.
"I wish It were the month of May
fi. that I could go down to my
summer home nt Seabrlght. I love
that Jersey shore., and a tennis court
there la Just waiting for us. Hero l
am In Now York not ovon knowing
where I am going to tlvo. I um Just
camping out In tho house of my good
Wend George Leary."
Two moving picture men at this
moment sent In appeals for Mr. Oar
rtoon to please como out nnd give
them a shot at him. The ex-Secrotary
was In rare good humor and said:
Those boys havo been waiting for
me since 7 o'clock this morning. Tlioy

SOMUWHKRE IN THE NORTH
SEA (via London), Feb. 11. Great
Britain's first lino offcnslvo fleet, an
Incomparable combination of speed
and gun power ready for Instant ac
Hon, was Inspected yestorday by a
party of French and American cor
respondents. A representative of the
Associated' Press was permitted to
View from tho brldgo of a .torpedo boat
the naval unit which is expected to
meet the tlrst shock of a German
attack.
In tho fleet went virtually all the
veteran lighting craft which havo
been In action In thin war, but they
showed fow scars with the exception
of on occasional dent In their armor.
The prldo of placo was held by bat
tlo cruisers which In engagements
from the 1'alkland Isles to tho Dar
danelles havo borne the brunt of the
sea lighting.
Unpopular with officers and men
before tho war because they were
constantly coaling and never more
than cautiously praised by tho pro
poncnts of tho supcr-droadnought
policy, these hugo fighting machines
hold the premier position In the Brit
IhIi navy, In which warship speed Is
now regarded an tho first and most
Important principle of naval strategy.
As tho launch with tho visitors on
board turned toward tho lino of battle
cruisers against the horizon they
could see tho "eyes of tho fleet," In
tho form of a few prowling dostroy
ers, which keep up incessant watch
not only to protect tholr mighty sts-
ters from submarine attack but
catch tho first view of any adventure
somo German warship which might
poke its noso into the open North
Sea.
Tho correspondents wero taken on
board tho crusler Lion, which was Ad
mlral Beatty's flagship In tho Dogger
Bonk battle. With tho exception of
a dent In her forward turret armor
and a similar scar Just abovo the wa-
terllne, this show vessel of the British
Navy displays little sign Of the ter
rifle hammering she got when threo
German battle crulsors concentrated
their fire on her.
Carefully mounted In tho oompan
lonway Is nn 11-lnch uncxploded shell,
which the Seydlltr. hurled through the
Lion's armor below the waterllne.
Tho celebrated Tiger Is In the line
looking like a newly commissioned
ship despite tho many times she In
reported to have been sunk.
Iloyond tho battle cruisers a long
Hue of light cruisers lost Itself In
tho fog. Borne of those vessels ore
veterans and they show signs of tho
rough patrol Work they are called upon
constantly to do, but many are newly
commissioned and havo yet to wear
tho scars of service.
Beyond tho light cruisers was
flotilla of colliers constantly feeding
tho hungry stoke-holds of the battle
cruisers, which even at anchor keep
up a full head of steam as their tur
bines iiuiHt bo rested but must never
be allowed to grow cold.

Dr. Deady Defends His "Life
in Love" in Shadows of
Columbia University.
;INDS NO SOCIAL BAN.
Wins Another's Wife and Gives
Up Own as Unreal, De
fying Conventionality.
A legal fight for the possession of a
nine-year-old boy which was started
to-day In the Hupromc Court by Dr.
Gunnl J. Buuck. a wealthy physician
of Westflold, N. Y., revealed that
within the shadow of Columbia Uni
versity tho boy's mother. Mra. Char-
lotto Busck. Is living -with Dr. Hen
derson B. Deady, well known psycho-
anarr&t, as his "ptycho bride." She
Is known a such to some nf the
most prominent members of Columbia
faculty, and to an Evening World re
porter who called uptfn him Dr. Deady
Justified his idealistic existence.
Dr. Doady's Ideas of matrimony
aro so strange that Dr. Busck, who
divorced his wifo in 1911, feara his
son, Richard, as ho grows older will
bo Influenced by them.
Dr. Busck might havo spared him
self tho present litigation, Dr. Deady
says, If, when tho divorce was pond
lng In Suffolk County, the aggrieved
husband had consented to permit tho
psycho-analyst to visit his home
whonovor he liked. Dr. Busck would
not ngreo to this arrangement and
sued for divorce, naming Dr. Deady
as co-respondent.
Just beforo the cosu wan tried Dr.
Doady nnd Mrs. Busck and Richard,
the little son, sailed for Europo,
where Dr. Deady passed several
months studying undor Karl Jung.
When thu gossip attending the dl
vorco suit suUsldud Dr. Doady and
hlB psycho-bride nnd the boy rotumed
to this country nnd wont to live In ae
elusion at Brook Held. Conn., the sum
raor homo of Mrs. Busck. Later tho
couplo and Uttlo Dick came to Now
York and took separate apartmonts
at No. 434 West One Hundred and
Twentieth Street. Later they moved
Into a larger apartment together.
Thoro may bo something unusual
In my modo of living, In the eyes of
tho uninitiated," Dr. Doady aald to
an Evonlng World reporter at his
apartment last night, "but In the
enlightened circle In which Mrs.
Busck and I travel, we, along with our
Ideals, are accepted as miman beings
And that clrclo Includes some of the
best people connected with Columbia
Unlvoralty.
"The lady and I havo discarded the
sentimental and emotional things In
liro. we are living according to psy
cho-analysln.
"Psycho-analysis li the mental side
of medicine. Its province Is to cast
out the falso In life and lovo and make
uso of the real.
"Beforr Dr. Busok brought the di
vorce suit In Huffolk County, we had
a heart to heart talk and ho was
given every opportunity to fit a place
in our sohome. Wo offered to permit
him to pose as the worldly husband
of Mrs, Busck, but to maintain only
formal friendly relations with nor.
Wo woro porfoctly agreeable to his
dining with us, entertaining with us
and taking part In family conferences,
but beyond that, wo decided, he was
not to go. lie would not agree to
this. Mrs. Busck obtained her free
dom I couldn't. I am still married
In the eyes of the law to tho sister of
Dr. Busck.
"Tho Inevitable happened. I gave
up my wlfo who was unreal, accord
ing to tho psycho analyst.
"I bellevo In monogamy and am
not against murriago. I am opposed
to the conventions of marriage, A
psycho-analylBt cannot see where the
Stato and Church get their authority
to Interfere with love.
When Dr. Doady was told that his
fellow tenants In the hou.se regarded
him and Mrs, Itusek n- a brother and
slater. Dr. Deady bald:
"Why, thoy have no right to do
that. V live as ina:i and .vlfe It
In becaUHo VirM calls .no 'Uncle
Henny,' 1 guess, that thoy gut the
Idea I was the lady's brother."
