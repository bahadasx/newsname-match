Washington, Feb. 0. Berlin

provisional acceptance of Ger
many's latest proposals on tho
Lusitania. America's accep
tance will be msdo complete
when the German foreign office
substitutes a formal uote for the
informal memorandum presented
by Ambassodor Bernptorff last
week.
The informal memorandum
which President Wilson agreed
would be acceptable, when made
into a formal note, ie held to con
cede practicully every demand
made by the United States and
to assure safety of American
voyagers. It is regarded, in ef
fect, as a real disavowal of the
sinking of the vessel. Aud, what
tho President considers even of
greater importance, it forms a
diplomatic precedent and a basis
for international law regarding
submarine warfare.

GIRLS! GIRLS! TRY IT!
STOP DANDRUFF AND
BEAUTIFY YOUR HAIR
Hair stops falling out and
gets thick, wavy, strong
and beautiful
Your hair bocomos light, wavy
Huffy, abnndant and appears as
soft, lustrous and beantifnl as a
young girl's after a "Dandorino
hair cleanses." Just try thie
moisten a cloth with a little
Danderine and carefully draw it
through your hair, taking oue
small strand at a time, This
will cleanse the hair of dust, dirt
and excessivo oil and Jinjjuat a
few moments you have doubled
tho beauty of your hair.
Besides beautifying tho hair!
at once. Dandenno dissolves or.
ery particle of dnndruff; cleans-?
es, pnrifios and invigorates the
scalp, forever stopping itching
and falling hair.
But what will please yon most
will be after a few week's nso
when you will actually see new
hair fine and downy at first-
yes but really now hair grow
ing all over the scalp. If yon
care for pretty, soft hair and lots
of it surely get a 25-cent bottle
of ' Kriowlton's Dandorinec-itom
any druggist or" toilet counter,
and just try it! . '
ffii Interesting Adtfress
Tuesday evening 8th mat. St.
Bernard Lodge No. 240 I.O.O.F.
of this place, was treated to a
lecture on Odd Fellowship by the
past Grand Chaplain of the Grand
Lodge of Odd Fellows of Ken
tucky".
Bro. Goodsoon, (who by the
way is tho Presiding Elder of
tbe M. E. Church, south, in this
district) gave us the most prac
tical and instructive lecture that
has been our pleasure to hear in
many days.
We know a little about Odd-
fellowship by experience and ob
servation in Kentucky ; but wo
had no idea of, the beneficence
and good influence the Order ib
exerting throughout the State of
Kentucky.
The Lodge held an open meet-
iugandan invitation had been
given to the public to attend,
and a considerable number of
profanes attended.
The lecturer, besides giving us
splendid history of the workings
of the Grand Lodge of I.O.O.F.
in Kentucky, and its two "Homes
for Orphan Children" and "In
digent Odd Fellows" and their
wives, is an orator of the first
magnitude, aud we recommend
him heartily to the consideration
of the citizens of Eirliugton as a
public speaker.
Time works wonders. It may even
yet unearth acaudldate orj.two for
the vioe presidency.
Need of Contrast In Beauty.
An essential prerequisite to all beau
ty Is contrast. To obtain artUtlc ef
fect light must bo put In Juxtaposition
wltb Bhade, bright cojora with dull, a
fretted surfuco with a plain one. Forte
passages In music must have piano
passages to rollevo them, concerted
pieces need interspersing with solos,
and rich chords must not bo continu
ously repeated. This goneral princi
ple will, I think, explain the truns
formaUon of tho. bygone useful Into
tho present beautiful. It Is by virtue
of their contrast with our prommt
modes of life that past modes of life
look Interesting and romantic nor
bort Bponcor.
Tea tt)d:
Tea seeds resemble haxolnuts. They
aro sown in bods to grow thickly to
gether like cabbages.
BECAUSE HIS BUS

ADVERTISED
Letter Addressed to "The

Good Contract -,.-
Another proof that "it pays to
advertise." The way a letter
followed E. F. Dowdna froms
Madisonville to an address at Mat
new place of rosidonce some time
after he had moved, proves the
adage; The writer could not
think of Mr. Dowdna's name but
ho know that ho drilled wells and
a hole in tho gronnd was what ha
wanted. So ho addressed his
letter to
"The Well Digger Man,
Madisonville, Ky."
This letter was forwarded to
his new address, and Dowdnai
answered and got a three thous
and dollar job on the strength,
of it.

Christian hurch Notes
In a recent letter from Miss Alloa
Miller to tbe Sunday School, she?
tells of the "Giving Christmas" her
Sunday School enjoyed this year.
following tbe example of the Earl
lngton school last year, when they

She felt this to be the best Christ
mas these Japanese have enjoyed.
She continues to bo In splendid
health and asks for the prayers oC
her friends in Earllngton.
