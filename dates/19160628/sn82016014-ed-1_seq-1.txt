Washington. June 28. The govern

of the state, war and navy depart

used on those who insist on remaining
in Mexico "until the last minute."

Washington. June 28. The senate
this afternoon ordered its conferees1 on
the military draft resolution not to
recede from their position of refusing
pay to the dependent families of na
tional giiH!-d?inen drafted into the
service. The senate then sent the
whole controversy back to conference.
Earlier, despite a plea by Senator
Chamberlain, the senate this after
noon refused to lay aside the postal
appropriations bill to consider the con
ference report on the militia draft
resolution. This gave the deadlock
between the house and senate an in
creasingly serious aspect;
Stone said the purpose of the reso

Sapid Preparations on Border
for New Arrivals.
Chicago. June 28. Orders were Is
sued today by MaJ. Gen. Thomas H.
Barry, in command of the central de
partment of the United States army,
for the immediate movement to the
border of all units of the Illinois, Mis
souri, Kansas and Wisconsin national
guard which are "reasonably ready."
The following statement was issued
at General Barry's office:
"Orders have been issued directing
the dispatch of all units In Illinois,
Kansas, Missouri and Wisconsin, when
mustered in, examined and reasonably
ready. The Illinois cavalry will go to
Brownsville, Tex., all other Illinois
troops to San Antonio.
"Kansas troops will go to Eagle
Pass, Tex.
"Missouri troops will go to Laredo,
Tex. Wisconsin troops will go to San
Antonio, Tex. Other troops will be
dispatched whenever reported reason
ably ready."
Massachusetts on Way.
San Antonio, Tex., June 28. Gen
eral Wood notified General Funston
early today that the Massachusetts
National Guard started for the border.
Preparation for distributing and
maintaining the militia are being
made all along the border today.
Funston and his staff are believed to
be arranging the troops so that a
sweeping movement could be started
from several points simultaneously in
case invasion iff ordered, and at the
same time leave adequate protection
for border towns against raids.
There is a strict censorship on all
news of troop movements, even the
railroads of the state having adopted
the policy of divulging no movements
over their lines, without waiting for
the government to suggest 'secrecy in
that direction. Small detachments of
eastern guardsmen are known to have
reached Texas, but their exact destina
tions are not known.
Carranzistas Concentrate.
Concentration of Carranza troops
opposite Naco, Ariz., continued to be
a source of apprehension to United
States army officers today. The Mex
ican forces are said to be in much
larger numbers than at first reported
and advices early today said there are
6,000. A Carranza army ten times that
size is reported to be stationed at
Cananea, 9 7 miles south of Naco. The
American forces are understood to be
fully prepared for an attack on Naco
or Bisbee.
Only One Troop lft.
Niantic, Conn., June 28. All the
Connecticut troops ordered to the
Mexican bolder were moving south to
day with the exception of A troop cav
alry which remains in camp for the
present because of lack of equipment.
The last contingents left early today.
New York Has 40.000 More.
New York, June 2 8. Some 14,000
national guard troops from the de
partment of the east already are on
their way to the Mexican border to
day. Unwards of 40.000 more are in
state camps or armories waiting to be
sent away as soon as equipment and
transportation can be provided.
Responding to an urgent appeal
from General Funston for more
troops. Major General Wood is trying
to forward additional regiments as
quickly as possible. He hopes to be
able to start for the border today a
brigade of Pennsylvania troops, a regi
ment and a battalion of field artillery
and possibly a regiment of engineers
and a squadron of cavalry from New
York state, the New Hampshire con
tingent and cavalry and field artillery
from Massachusetts.
The Twelfth regiment of New York
and the Second regiment having had
quarters at Troy, but now at Camp
Whitman, expected to entrain at any
mrment. The First battalion of the
First field artillery, the Twenty-second
engineers, a squadron of the First cav
alry and a field hospital and ambu
lance company, all of New York, also
are ready to start today if the trans
portation Is provided. The Pennsyl
vania troops are under orders to pro-
ceea to c;i raso, wmie those rrom the
District of Columbia will go to Bis-
bee, Ariz.

Says Carranza's Eeply To Be
Handed to Him Today.
Washington, June 28. Special
Agent Rodgers at Mexico City, in a
brief telegram dated yesterday and
received at the state department early
today, said he expected to be handed
today Carranza's reply to the Ameri
can note demanding the release of
soldiers taken prisoner at Carrizal.
The message, containing but two
sentences, was1 the first word the de
partment had heard from Mr. Rodgers
since he reported the delivery of the
note. It said it was believed the Mexi
can authorities were investigating the
Carrizal affair, but gave no Indication
of what would be the reply to the
American demands.

If it should become necessary for
the United States to pacify and po
lice Mexico, the plans of operation
are all mapped out by the war col
lege at Washington. According to
these plans, there would be two main
troop movements into Mexico. One
would be through Texas and into
Mexico wholly by land. The second
would be over sea to Vera Cruz and
from there inland. This second
movement, to insure success, would
need at least 100,000 men. The pro
posed movements are shown by ar

El Paso, Tex.. June 28. The hope
of looting El Paso buoyed the half
starved and poorly clothed peons of
Carranza's northern army today. Re
ports from interior Mexico declare the
Chihuahua soldiers of the de facto
government have been told by officers
that just as soon as they reach El Paso
they will have plenty of food.
Four prominent American mining
men arrived In El Paso from Parrai
after narrowly escaping being mobbed
at Santa Rosalia and again at Chihua
hua. Anti-American demonstrations
were held in both towns as the Ameri
cans' train was passing through. The
presence of armed Carranista guards
prevented the mobs from dragging the
Americans off the train.
The refugees were T. G. Hawkins,
Jr., A. M. Morris, H. A. Buck and R.
C. Highley.
55,000 De Factos in Chihuahua.
They reported heavy Mexican troop
movements northward and intimated
that 10,000 Carranza soldiers were en
route to Chihuahua from southern
points. This would bring the total
strength of the de facto government's
armies in the ttate to over 56,000.
Plans have been made by the Amer
ican force in Fl Paso for spoiling the
reported looting party. Gen. George
Bell, Jr.. commanding 3.600 troops at
Fort Bli-s, .s known to have prepared
in the event of war, plans for crossing
the Rio Grande, seizing the two Mex
ican lines which terminate In Juarez
and moving on the Villa Ahamuda and
Chihuahua. If any opposition is of
fered by the small garrison left in the
Mexican town after the principal Car
ranista force has evacuated it, Juarez
will be leveled. American guns could
lay the town in ruins in thirty minutes,
American army officers say.

Villista leader, are reported to have
reached Chihuahua from exile in
Cuba. Reports say these men have
been given commands in the Carranza
army.
Villistas Gather at Juarez.
El Paso, June 28. Fresh cause for
apprehension was found today along
the border in news of the gathering
or strong forces of former Villa sol
diers under notorious chieftains in
the vicinity of Juarez and the close
surveillance by the civil and military
authorities on former adherents who
are now refugees in EI Paso.
Gen. Jose Flores. commanding 800
infantrymen, is reported In Juarez
after making peace with the de facto
government. Gen. Manuel Banda,

THE POINT TO WHICH KANSAS TROOPS HAVE BEEN ORDERED

Brewster Issues Ultimatum to
the Kansas Natural.
Receivers Must Submit Definite
Program, He Says.
WILL BE SETTLED THURSDAY
Conference Will Be Held in
Independence.
Representatives of All Interests
Expected to Attend.
Unless there is a positive, definite
program offered by the receivers for
the Kansas Natural Gas company, S.
M. Brewster, attorney general, will
seek to force the sale of til's com
pany's property. The matter will be
settled Thursday when a conference
is held in Independence.
This afternoon General Brewster
stated that he would insist on a defi
nite oroerram from the gas company
receivers. He will not delay this de
mand. Unless the receivers make a
real showing in Independence. Bie-.v-ster
proposes to ask for a dissolution
of the receiversnip. ne win men
to force the sale of the gas company
property.
John Hunt, assistant attorney gen
eral, wrill leave Topeka tonight for In
dependence. He will represnt the
state at the hearing. His course is
clearlv outlined and Brewster stated
this afternoon that one of two policies
must be positively followed. Brew
ster's statement was made when he
was shown a telegram from a Kansas
mayor in which it was stated that
Brewster had promised to move for
a dissolution of the receivership.
W'hat Brewster Said.
"I didn't say I would ask for a
dissolution of the receivership in In
dependence," said Brewster. "This Is
what I did say, though. I told the re
ceivers that unless they offered a defi
nite program for development and fi
nancing of the company, I would ask
the court for an order for the sale
of the property. That would, of
course, dissolve the receivership."
Representatives of the Dougherty
interests will appear in Independence.
They control the Wichita gas company
and have sought to secure control of
the Kansas Natural. Before their pro
gram is seriously considered. It was
stated that they would be examined as
to their plans and ability to handle the
proposition.
The move which may result in the
dissolution of the gas receivership is
one of the most drastic drives against
the gas company in the fight for more
gas in Kansas and Missouri. At a re
cent conference in Topeka, receivers
stated that creditors and bondholders
were expected to provide $2,000,000
for betterments and the develop
ment of the natural gas fields.
Rather vague statements were made,
however, concerning the security
which would be offered in return for
this investment. The entire matter is
to be fought out in Independence and
the future of the Kansas Natural and
its long drawn out receivership will
doubtless be settled before the end of
the week.

London. June 28. Interest in the
expected grand offensive of the allies
shifted temporarily today to the situa
tion in the Balkans, with the receipt
of reports that Rumania is prepar
ing to Join the allies.
A heavily censored Bucharest dis
patch telegraphed via Athens reported
that Bulgaria had closed her frontier
against Rumania. Bulgarian troops
were reported to be concentrating
along the Rumanian frontier.
The Evening News received a
Bucharest dispatch reporting that the
Rumania cabinet at a special ses
sion took certain steps as a result of
Bulgaria's movements. Rumanian
military chiefs participated in the cah-

Uneasy Over Greece.
Vienna reports received at Amster

cause 'Greece yielded to the demands
of the allies.
Berlin dispatches today were silent
on the latest Balkan developments,
but laid heavy emphasis on the con
tinued bombardment of German lines

believes, is an attempt to wreck Ger
man defensive works in preparation
for a great infantry onslaught.
Correspondents In Switzerland re
ported today that successes of Rus
sian and Italian offensives are caus
ing the greatest consternation in
ienna. The- Austrians are clamoring
for the abandonment of the Verdun of

ing of more troops to the Austrian
front.
British Headquarters in France,
Tuesday June 27 via London, June
'British guns continued today the
bombardment over a broad front
which was begun yesterday. The As
sociated Press correspondent riding
seventy miles behind the lines, found
the same regular pounding of posi
tions on both days, whether in the
Sommer region or along the Vimy
ridge. Going to a point on high
ground which allowed a broad sweep
of vision in a rolling country or for
ward observation posts in the trenches
the correspondent found the horizon
always bounded by shell bursts. There
might be a lull at one point for a
while but soon the inferno in that di
rection was renewed.
Under cover of the bombardment
the British made numerous trench
raids last night, bringing in groups
of prisoners. The British released
gas at certain points, but discontinued
this when the weather was found to
be unfavorable.

State Charter Board Approres
Application Street Railway
For a Big Increase in Its
Capital Stock.
The state charter board today ap
proved the application of the Topeka
Railway company for a million dol
alr increase in capitalization. The in
crease is from $1,250,000 to $2,250,000.
Plans of the street railway company
were not contained in the application
before the state charter board. At the
offices of Ferry, Doran & Cosgrove,
attorneys for the company, it was
stated that the money would be used
for local betterments and improve
ments and to meet outstanding bonds.
Members of the law firm denied that
they possessed knowledge of a plan to
build an interurban line to Lawrence.
Since the increase in capitalization
was announced, rumors have been cur
rent to the effect that the McKinley
interests propose to engage in the in
terurban game. One report was to the
( effect that a line from Topeka to
. Lawrence was considered. L. S. Ferry
a member of the law firm, stated that
the money would be used for local im

James W. Orr Wants Him Appointed
to Fill Hughes's Place.
James W. Orr of Atchison and other
Kansas Democrats may present the
name of William H. Thompson. United
States senator from Kansas, as a can
didate for justice of the United States
supreme court to succeed Justice
Charles Evans Hughes, resigned. It is
claimed President Wilson today grant
ed an audience to Orr and other Kan
sans and Senator Thompson's appoint
ment was urged.
The name of the Kansas senator was
mentioned recently when an appoint
ment was made by President Wilson
to succeed the late Justice Lamar. But
Kansas Democracy did not take the
suggestion kindly at that time. Since
the Brandeis appointment, however,
many of the difficulties of the Kansas
Democrats have been adjusted. Now
there is a real serious claim Senator
Thompson's name is to be presented as
one of the candidates for the life ap

Hughes, who resigned following his
nomination for the presidency by the
Republican national convention.

mission as a major general in th
event of war with Mexico and a call
by the president for volunteers, it has
been learned here from authoritative
sources. Elaborate plans have been
made quietly to recruit the organiza
tion from picked men throughout the
country, and it is said that Colonel
Roosevelt has worked out every de
tail that would expedite the mobiliza
tion of the large fighting unit. Even
the horses and mules necessary are
said to have been pledged.
The division will consist. It Is re

machine guns will accompany the
division.
Army Officials Approve Plan.
It is understood Colonel Rooeevelt
and his aides have consulted with his
friends in the regular army holding
high rank and the entire scheme has
been received with approval. If it is
possible the principal commanding of
