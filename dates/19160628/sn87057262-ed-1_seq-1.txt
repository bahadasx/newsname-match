Says Irish Rebellion Was Not
Hatched in Germany or
That He Wlas Paid.

LONDON, June 28.—Taking the
Witness (box in his own defense in
his trial on the charge of treason,
Sir Roger Casement this afternoon
denied that the Irish rebellion was in
Wy way inspired In Germany.
Casement made a formal statement
to the Jury. 'He denied that he had
received any money from Germany.
"The charge that the Irish rebel
lion was inspired in Germany is un
true," he said. "It was neither made
®or directed by Germans."
Sir Roger wag presented as a wit
ness after the presiding Justices had
overruled a motion to quash the in
dictment against him on technical
grounds. He fcspoke eafc-nestiy, taut

In New York, most interest cen

Trains Await In Yards.
CHICAGO, June 28.—'Forty-six
trains and crews waited in CHicagp
railway yards to speed eastern militia
southward to the border. Trainmen
are ready this morning to speed up
the trains from the eastern roads to
said the trains carrying New York
militia, the first expected to arrive
here, would not leave Toledo until
10:30 a. m.
Arrangements for handling forty
six trains within the next twenty
four hours were completed by a Joint
board of railway operating officials.
None of the trains so far as could be
learned were to be brought into the
city, all being transferred in outlying
yards, with as little delay as possible.
To relieve the trunk lines between
Chicago and the border of immediate
congestion, most of the eastern
troops were to be transferred here
first to Chicago-St. Louis and Chicago
Kansas City lines, for retransfer at
those points to the border trunk
roads.
In this way, the Santa Fe, Southern
Pacific and Rock Island were free in
Chicago to movo freight supplies
rapidly to tho border today and to
morrow before they were burdened
with troop trains.
Santa Fe officials sa!8 trainload
after trainload of meat, other provi
sions and equipment were being dis
patched from here direct to the bor
der today.
The Santa Fe does not expect to
have to handle a single troop train
until tomorrow .and then only from
St. Louis or Kansas City.
The troops were ordered to entrain
for the following destinations:
Illinois First cavalry—Browns
ville, Texas. All other Illinois troops
to San Antonio.
SIR ROGER CASEMENT DENIES

the reduction of rations and other
punishment inflicted upon Irish sol
diers who refused to Join the bri
gades he was organizing, declaring
such allegations to be "abominable
falsehoods."
His denial that he had ever re
ceived German money was most em
phatic.
"Those who know me, know that I
never sold myself to any man or any
government," he declared.
"I wish to refute this slander be
cause so often money was offered
me in liberal sums and I refused,"
added Casement. "I left Germany
poorer than I entered."
In his opening statement, Attorney
General Smith had denounced Case
ment for accepting knighthood and
a pension at the hands of the Brit
ish government and then playing into
the hands of British enemies.
Casement replied that it was not
in his power to refuse the of
fer of knighthood and that he ac
cepted the pension because he had
earned it through government serv
ice. The attorney general had made
a vague allusion to his connection
with the uprising in Ireland, he said,
but had produced no evidence to up
hold his statement. ,,

points yet to be named as soon as
"reasonably ready."
The Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin
and Kansas troops will not be de
layed in departure for lack of equip

border.
Several regiments In each of these
states are ready to move today, being
mustered in and examined.

midnight
tonight
Col. E. M. Lewis of the regular
army, received word from General
Barry of the central division at Chi
cago, to make an inventory of the
equipment of the regiments reason
ably prepared for service and to pre
pare these regiments for entrainment
orders which will be issued immedi
ately upon receipt of word that the
inventory has been completed. Colonel
Lewis stated the inventory of the First
regiment probably will ba completed
by noon, when the word will be sent
General Berry. Following the inven
tory of the First, the regular army
officers in charge of this work will
immediately start upon the inventory
of the Second and Seventh regiments.
Because these are the only three
regiments that have been mustered
into the federal service, it is likely
they will be the only units to leave
for several days. Following the com
pletion of inventory of three regi-
the lines that will transport the ments, the regular army officers will
mijitia another leg of their Journey
toward Texas. The trains from the
east, however, were moving slower
than ants and It appeared likely that
none of them would reach Chicago
before late afternoon. At 18:00 a.:"mr
the New York Central dispatcher
return to mustering in the Third,
Fourth and Eighth regiments, after
which they also will be ready for an
inventory and entrainment.
Word that at least part of the I. N.

day spread like wildfire through Camp
Dunne. Companies gathered about
yell leaders and the camp reverber
ated with their Joyful shouts. Col.
Joseph B. Sanborn of the First, an
nounced his men are ready. There
are approximately 1,115 men in the
regiment. Five percent were lost by
the physical, test, but the regiment is
still up to war strength.
Weather is Fierce.
EiL PASO, Texas, June 28.—Militia
men from northern and eastern states
at first will find the weather along
the border almost intolerable, unac
customed as they will be to the ter
rilio heat.
In the Brownsville district It is
law and today very hot. Leaving the
gulf country th© Mexican border ris
es gradually from sea level to 3,700
feet altitude at EH Paso. Farther
westward the heat becomes more in
tense, reaching its maximum along
the Arizona line where the thermom
eter seldom drops below 100 degrees
in the summer months.
A fairly accurate average of tem
perature along the border in June,
July and August is 95 degrees. In
low altitudes the combination of heat
and humidity saps the energy.
Illinois on the Move.
CHICAGO, June 28.—Tho first Illi
nois infantry -Rill entrain at 2 p. m.!
and the Second Illinois infantry to
night, it was stated. These troops
probably will reach th© border be
fore any eastern militia.
In addition to the general order to
the four states, three of them, Illi
nois, Missouri and Kansas, were giv
en authority to move for the border
at their own officers' direction, with
out reporting back to the central de
partment their readiness.
The First Illinois will go via the
Chicago and Alton to Higbee, Mo.,
and via the M. K. and T. to San

THj PASO, Texas, June S8.—The
hope of looting El Paso, buoyed tho
half starved and poorly clothed peons
of Carranza's northern army today.
Reports from interior Mexico declar
ed the Chihuahua soldiers of the
defacto government have been told
by officers that Just as soon as they
reach El Paso they will have plenty
of food. Four prominent .American
mining men arrived in El Paso from
Paral after having narrowly escaped
being mobbed at Santa Rosalia and
again at Chihuahua. AntijAmerican
demonstrations were held in both
towns as the Americans' train was
passing through. Presence of armed
Carranzlsta guards prevented the
mobs from dragging the Americans
off the train.
The refugees were T. G. "Hawkins,

Uighley. Tfiey" reported E6avy
Mexican troop movements northward,
estimating that 10,000 Carranza sol
diers were enroute to Chihuahua from
southern points.
This would bring the total strength
of the defacto government's armies
In the state to over 65,000 men.
Plans have been made by the Amer
ican force in El Paso for spoiling the
reported looting party. General
George Bell, Jr., commanding 3,500
troops at Fort Bliss, is known to
have prepared in the event of war,
plans for crossing the iftio Grande,
seizing the two Mexican lines which
terminate in Juarez and moving on
to Villa Ahumda and Chihuahua. If
any opposition is offered 'by the
small garrison left in the Mexican
town after the principal Carranzlsta
force evacuated it, Juares will be
leveled. The American 4.7 guns
overlooking Juarez from the mesa
bade of El Paso, oould lay the adobe
town in. ruins within thirty minutes,
army officers estimated.
The prospect of looting B1 Paso is
reported to
have
been.strongly held
out to former Villistas who were
urged to Join the Carranzlsta army.
With the promise of amnesty, re
cruiting officers are rallying every
possible element to Carranza's stand

General Maximo Castillo, who plan
ned the Cumbre tunnel disaster, in
which a score of American travelers
met their deaths General Manuel
Banda, who once sold out the Vil
llsta garrison in Juarez to the Car
ranzista generals, and Jose Flores,
another former Villlsta leader, are
reported to have reached Chihuahua
from exile In Cuba. Reports say the
men have been given commands in
the Carranzlsta army.
James Brown, an American negro,
who reached El Paso from Interior
Mexico, by telling tho Carranza sol
diers he was a Jamaica negro and
not an American resident, declared
General Trevino told him in Chi
huahua he would not release the
Americans captured in the Carrizal
fight. Brown's appearance In Juarez
yesterday afternoon led to the un
founded report that two other Ameri
can survivors of the Carrizal fight
were held prisoners there.

"Pan-Americanism, which Is vital
