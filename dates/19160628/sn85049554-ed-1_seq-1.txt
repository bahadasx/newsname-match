Washington, June 28.—Special Agent
Xtodgers at Mexico City, in a briefrmes
!. .sa^e dated, yesterday and received at
.the state department today, said he ex
pected to be handed today Carranza's
reply to this American note demanding
the release'of soldiers taken at Carrl
«at\'p|
The-meisage, containing but two sen
tences, was the first word the depart
ment had bad.from Mr. Rodgera since
he reported the delivery of the note. It
said If 4ras believed the (Mexican au
thorities were Investigating the Carrl
zal light but gave ne Indication «f what
would be th* reply to the Americande
mands.
CruoialDay at Hand.
Ss
is was regarded by twfcahlngton'of
as the crucial day in tbe negotia
tion With Hexico.
It is ^he last day probably allowed
Carransa. in, .wblek- to comply
ItedStates demands forre
_.. fPtfiitwenty-three troopers held
..^ai feriittfiera at Chihuahua (Ofty* If fcis,
"reply, either by act or in a eommutkfei
tlon, does not arrive by tonight or If It
is unsatisfactory, President Wilson Is
determined to go before congress prob
ably tomorrow and ask the authority to
rescue-the prisoners by force.
Muet-Release Prisoners.
Anything short of immediate-release
of the American troops now prisoners lives, recently returned to Mexico City
In Chihuahua City will be unsatisfac
tory. No suggestions or proposals of
negotiation or mediation will be ac
cepted.
It was said today that,Secretary Lan
sing's note prevents acceptance of any
plan to open discussion of the Carrl
zal incident. The fact that the men
were taken and are being held was
viewed as a hostile act requiring an act
of repudiation at once by the de facto
government.
Mr. Rodgers' statement that Carran
xa officers appear to be conducting an
Inquiry into the Carrizal' clash was in
terpreted here as indicating rather
that the reply would support the pre
vious assertions^hat American troops
were responsible than that a change
6t attitude was to be expeoted.
Elizeo Arredondo, the Carranza am
bassadctf designate, still had no word
today from his government about the
status of the diplomatic negotiations.
He has Informed General Carranza of
the determined sentiment In the United
States demanding the release of the'
troopers, but has had no answer.
Carraoaa Playing For Time.
Carransa's delay in replying to the
note is believed to be due largely to
his hopes to have South and Central
.America agree fully to his course'be
fore he takes, a final step.
President Wilson had a busy day to
day. He received a long line of sena
tors and representatives and shook
hands with more^than 100 persons.
John R. gilllman, consul at Saltillo,
who now is at Eagle Pass, Tex., kdviseg
the state department of the receipt by
Dr. Atl, editor of the Mexico City "la
bor papty, of a message from Carraiiza
saying h« was. prepared to do all pos
lble to avoid a break with the Unite*
States. Dr. Atl has been at Eagle Pase
participating in conferences designed
to aid in avoiding war and is expected
to come to Washington this week

NAON HOPE8 FOR PEACE.
South American Diplomat Says War in
America Is Inoonoeivfble.
New York, June 28.—Romulo S.
Naon, Argentina ambassadors to, the
United States, issued a statement here
in which he said1 that while lie^ had
made no offer of, mediation,—looking to
the settlement of the differences be
tween the United States and Mexico,
he was "In candor confident that the
crisis would be settfed peacefully."
The formal stateinent of the ambas
sador prompted, he sai.d, by public re
ports that he had offered mediation to
the United Stated says:
"I have made no offers but It Is
unnecessary to say that the Argentina
government- Is always- disposed to work
for the peace of America.
"Pan-Americanism, which is. vital for
all the countries of the continent,
whether great or small, strong or
weak, makes a war between two Aim
erican nations utterly Inconceivable. I
am, in candor, 'confident thfct' the crisis
will be settled peacefully. We mfast
make evidence- that no matter how
great the differences between two Am
erican governments, the continental
Interests of union and concord are su
preme and inconsistent with recourse
to violence as a means of settling in
ternational disputes In the Americas."
Ambassador Naon 'would not discuss
'what basis'he had for his feeling of
confidence.

The following statement -was issued
at General Berry's office:
"Orders have been issued directing

14,000 GUARDSMEN EN ROUTE.
Forty Thousand More, in Camp Ready
For Orders to Entrain.
New York, June 28.—More than 14,
000 National Guard troops of the de
partment of the east are on their way
to the border today. Upwards of 40,
000 more are in state camps or arm
ories waiting to be sent away as soon
as equipment and transportation can
be procured.

Brooklyn was ordered today to go 'to
the border as soon as it could entrain.
The regiment has been waiting in its

Troops May Be Ke)it at Camp Dodge
Until Ftflly Equipped..
Des Moines, June 28.—As far as
could be learned today no orders have
been received for troops of the Iowa
National Guard to entrain for the
border. No orders have be,en received
by the adjutant general today and
communication with Camp Dodge,
tw^tye miles outside the city, was cut
off because the single phone at the
camp was reserved for military pur
poses until other instruments could be
put in.
Officers said late last night that
permission had been given to advance
the age to which men can be enlisted
to 45 instead of 35, as formerly.
It was the" consensus of opinion
among officers of the guard that the
Iowa troops might be held in the
camp for some time. The fact that
ordnance equipment is being sent
here was said to indicate that the rar
department intends to equip the
troops for service at the cJmp and not
on the border, as had been believed.
Medical examination of enlisted men
continued today. About 1( per cent
were rejected for various reasons.
iRanks Thinned by Medioal Test.

Moines has shown the best record of
all companies mustered in up to now.
Only one man of the local company
was turned /down upon examination.
Company C, of Cedar llaplds, lost
heavily in men. They reached camp
with 104 men and twenty-one of that
number were turned down.

chief of mustering, said this afternoon
that th% First regiment is ready to go
to the border, that the Third and the
artillery would be ready tSnlght, and
that the Second regiment would be
ready Thursday. All of the infantry
men have been supplied with blankets
and rifles. They are now waiting for
shoes and* uniforms.

Waukegan, 111., June 28.—With a close

taken up again today. He is charged
with the murder of Marian Lambert,
his school girl sweetheart. Attorney
David R. Joslin resumed his cross ex

Marian on Dec. 15 last while Orpet was

"Did she return a letter to you un
opened at about that time?" asked
Joslin.
"Not then, nor at any other time," re

In Madison, for capsules.
"And didn't you say to Hassinger
that none of them was large enough?"
pursued Joslin.
"No."

"Yes."

Orpet what he said to her when she

PARKER SLAYERS KILLED?
Bandits Who Murdered Americans Re
ported to Have Been Puniahed.
Columbus, N. M., June 28.—Army of
ficers here are investigating a report
that the murderers of William Parker
and his wife, Americans, qti their ranch
southwest of Hachlta, were caught
early today on this side of the border
and killed. The report has not been
verified.
A message received by a relative of
the Parkers said that the bandits, six
In number, were wiped out.
It was said today that while em
ployes of the Diamond A ranch, nine
miles east of Hachltat were helping
hunt the slayers of the Parkers the
ranch was raided last night and a
number of horses taken.
Will Parker and his wife were mur
dered, presumably by Mexican bandits,
some time yesterday.
Parker and his wife were said ta
have been found by employes at th«
ranee house. Parker's place was vis
ited several days ago *o Mexican ban
dits and a number of horses and cattle
run off. A troop of cavalry followed
their trail at the time, but did not cross
the border.
Cow punchers of the Diamond A
ranch and U-Bar ranch outfit today
sent a courier to Hachlta with news
that they had uncovered a hot trail
and were following it into iMexico. It
was feared that fresh complications
may arise from this, as the? cowboys
probably are well Into the interior by
now.
Six (Mexicans were taken In Hachita
today on suspicion of being lnplicated
in the Parker murder and are being
held pending an Investigation.
Mexican^ Roughly Handled.
El Paso, June 28.—X number of com
plaints were filed with the Mexican
consulate today by Mexicans from the
neighborhood of Hachlta, N. M., who
alleged that they have been handled
roughly during the Investigation Into
the murder of Mr. and Mrs. W. Parker.
Some say they were beaten In a fight
on a train which they in no way pro
voked.
