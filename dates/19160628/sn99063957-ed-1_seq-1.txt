Her Ambassador Says Amer
ican Republics Should
Never Go To War
', 'w York, wJunc 2S. Hope for a
;ful settlement of the controversy
?en the United .States nnd Mexieo
; interests of Pau-Amricanism was
sscd by Dr. Komulo S. Naon, Ar-
ic ambassador to Washington.
2 a statement to the United Press
1 t- nbassador said lie had not made
t irmal offers of mediation on be
half of his governmeat, but expressed
the belief that wnr will yet be avoided.
His statement follows:
"I have made no offer, but it is un
necessary to say that tho Argentine
government is always disposed to work
for the peace of America.
"Pan-Americanism, which is vital for
all tho countries of the continent,
whether great or small, strong or weak,
makes wnr between two American na
tions utterly inconceivable. I am, in
candor, confident that the present crisis
will be peacefully settled. We must
make evident that no matter how great
the differences between two American
governments, the continental interests
or guion and concord are supreme aud
inconsistent without recourse to viol
ence as a means of settling interna
tional disputes in America.
"The Argentine people nnd govern
ment are following this conflict with
deepest concern and notwithstanding
the acuteness of tho crisis, I bolievc
that the inspiration of a sound, far
sighted political sense will prevail in
these hours so full of peril for the des
tinies of the continent."
Prices Were Irregular
and Trading Light
Now York, June 28 The New York
Evening Sun financial review today
said:
lkirelv more than a nominal market
prevailed in Wall Street for the great
er part- of the session on the stock ex
change today. Public buying was re
duced to n minimum', as a result of
the supposed imminence of General
Carranza's reply to the ultimatum de
manding the release oi the imprisoned
cavalrymen and the trading was left
entirely to the professionals, who
seemed unable ,t0 determine their spec
ulative course. .
Thus, while the traders appeared as
buyers at the outset, they shifted their
position and workedfor reaction in
the later dealings. Following a quiet i
slight and irregular price changes,
specialties moved up a point or so,
but. there was uo vigor in the trading.
Possibly because the general list
showed no signs of continuing the
race, the trading element reversed its
position around mid-day, utilizing an
unverified report that the Mexican re
ply had been received to depress the
Mexican issues and industrial special
ties. About the only exception" to the
general heaviness in the early after
noon was found in copper stocks. Re
actions aud lecoveries alternated in the!
Inter dealing.

How Militia Moves Today
Forty -Six Big Locomotives
Waiting In Chicago Yards
Chicago, June 28. -Fori y-six big loco
motives waited in Chicago railroad
yards today to speed eastern militia
regiment toward the border.
The train crews were ready to speed
up the remainder of the troop trains
from the eastern roads to the lines that
will transport the militia on another leg
of their journey toward Texas.
The trains from the east, however,
were moving more slowly than antici
pated and it appeared likely that none
would reach Chicago before late after
noon. At 1 a. m. the New York Central
dispatcher said the trains currying New
York militia, the first expected to ar
rive here, would not leave Toledo until
MulO a. m.
Arrangements for handling -Hi trains
within the next 2 hours were complet
ed by a joint board of railway operat
ing officials. None of the trains, so
far as c.oild be learned, were to be
brought into the city, all being trans
ferred in outlying yards with as little
delay ns possible. To relieve the trunk
lines between Chicago and the bonier of
immedinte congestion, most of the east
ern troops were to be transferred her
first to Chicago-Ht. Louis and Chicago
Kansas City lines for re-transfer at
those points to tho border trunk roads.

By Ed L. Keen.
(United Press stuff correspondent.)
London, June 28. Interest in the ex
pected grand offensive of the allies
shifted temporarily today to tho situa
tion in the Balkans, with the revival of
reports that Rumania is preparing to
join the allies.
A heavily censored Bucharest dis
patch, telegraphed via Athens, reported
that Bulgaria had closed her frontier
against Rumania. Bulgarian troops
were reported to be concentrating along
the Rumanian frontier.
The Kveuing News received ft Buch
arest dispatch reporting that the Ku
maniau cabinet, at a special sessiou,
took certain steps as a result of Bul
garia's movements. Kumanian mili
tary chiefs participated in the cabinet
conference.

of the allies. They fear not only thut
ex-Premier Venixelos will return to
power, swinging Greece to the sido of
the, ullies, hut that both the Ruman
ian and Greek army may turn against
Bulgaria, invading from opposite sides
while tho Austro-Gernians are busy on
other fronts.
Berlin dispatches today were silent
oa the latest Balkan developments, but
laid heavy emphasis on the continued
bombardment of Gorman lines opposite
the British front. The cannonade, Ber
lin believes, is a systematic attempt to
wreck German defensive works in pre
paration for a great infantry onslaught.
Correspondents in Switzerland report
ed today that the success of the Rus
sian and Italian offensive is causing the
direst consternation in Vienna. The
Austrians are clamoring for the aband
onment of the Verdun offensive by the
Germans and the sending of more troops
to the Austrian 'front.

SEVERAL BANDITS HAVE

Fourteen Refugees Stopped

Near Nogales
Fl Paso, Texas, June 28. -The hope of
looting El l'ni.o buoyed the half starved
and poorly clothed peons of Carranza's
northern army today. Reports from in
terior Mexico declare the Chihuahua
soldiers of the de facto government
have been told by officers thnt ns soon
as they reach El Taso they will have
plenty of food.
Several prominent mining men ar
rived in El Paso from Purrul, after nar
rowly escaping being mobbed nt Santa
Rosalia and again at Chihuahua. Anti
American demonstrations were held in
several towns as the Americans' train
was passing through. The presence of
armed Carranzista guards prevented the
mobs from dragging the Americans off
tho train.
The refugees were T. O. Hawkins,
Jr., A. M. Morris, H. A. Buick and II.
C. Highley.
They reported heavy .Mexican troop
movements northwnid estimating that
10,000 Cnrrunza soldiers were eu route
to I hihunhua from southern points. This
would bring the total strength of the
de facto government's armies in the
state to over !.", 000 men.
m Will Got Hot Welcome. .
Plans have been made by the Amer
ican force in El Paso for spoiling the re
ported looting party. General George
Bell, Jr., commanding .ViOO troops at
Fort Bliss, is known to have prepared,
iu the event of wur, plans for crossing
the ltio Grande, securing tho two Mex
ican lines which terminate iu Juarez
nnd moving on to Villa Ahumnda and
Chihuahua. If any opposition is offer
ed by the small garrison left in the
Mexican city after the principal Car
rnn.a forces evacuated it, Juarez will
be levelled. The American 4.7 guns
overlooking Juarez from the mesa back
of Kl Paso could lay the adobe town iu
ruins within 30 minutes, army officers
estimated.
The prospect of looting El Fnso is
reported to have been strongly held out
to former Villistas, who were urged to
join the Carranzista armv. With the
promise of amnesty, recruiting officers
are rallying every possible element to

Government Redoubles Ef
forts to Get Americans
Home Before War Starts
Washington, June 28. The govern
ment is redoubling its efforts to get
Americans out of Mexico before pos
sible trouble begins. Under direction
of the state, wnr and navy depart
ments, strongest persuasion is being
used in those who insist upon remain
ing in Mexico "until the last minute."
Administration officials today criti
cised the attitude of these Americans.
Hearts indicate most are on the west
ern const of Mexico. By remaining
contrary to the advice of President
jWilson, it is deelnred they are sub
jecting themselves to grave danger.
Orders have been sent by Secretnry
Baniels to Admiral Wiuslow to urge
those hesitating not to wait.
Tho reason for many Americans re
fusing to leave is the strong feeling
prevailing in many Mexican cities that
there will be no break between the
United Slates and Mexico.
Seventy Americans, including 21 de
tained in Guanajuato, left Mexico City
for Vera Cruz, in a special car yester
day, according to a message from Con
sul Rodgers to th state department
toibv. About seven hundred huve
left Mexico City and ,'!00 now remain.

A ruuner who had returned from one
of the posses stated thnt the bandits'
