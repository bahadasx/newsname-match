said: j
"In the last note forwarded to the

"The American jrovernment. prob

MOVES
Troop Arrangements Are Be

Heads in Texas
and Arizona.
STEP IS CONSIDERED
AS VERY SIGNIFICANT
Mysterious Mexican Wireless
Station is Heard Report
ing Activities of
Americans.
Intent iti n il News Service:
ill, PAO. Texas. June 2$. -Crn-sotship
hegan to close In on prepa
rations for the planned expedition in
Mexico by way of Juarez and de
tailed accounts of troop movements
was shielded with military secrecy.
At the same time it became known
that the ollicials of the American
army here, the tenter of the puls
inir situation, have already named
the censorship staff that will delete
the it-ports of vorrespondc-nts on tile
border.
At Columbus, x. M.. thore are to
day five censors, where, one, was suf
licif nt to pass all reports. The titrht
eiiiiiK of .information sources was
take a as a certain indication that
speedy action was contemplated,
see Vev Activities.
It is known that military activities
are :ihrH preceded by an applica
tion of censorship and today's re
strictpins promised an early move
ment, of troops. Army officers here
are certain that it will he their task
To ilsht their way to Chihuahua city
and secure the re-leasf of the Ameri
can troopers thero and they aro
eacer for tho task.
The rigors of censorship will be
espet ially hard on the "folks ba-ek
home" who will be anxious to hear
news of the pxperiences of the mil
itiamen. It is upon militia mov-
ments that the mailed list of censor -
ship first began to close.
Information reardin? the dis -
position of these bodies was refused
although it is known that all plans
fo.' the placing of the various
sru-irdsmen had been made. It was
expected that soon the first regi
ments from the east would be
brought to their posts in the Ml
Paso district, and at their posts
along the bonier. It is no secret
that the Mexican tie facto govern
ment has in operation a splendid
system of espionage. The danger
of spies may be more easily com
prehended when it is stated that
fully half of El Paso's population is
made up of Mexicans and in the
other border towns the proportion
i- even more over-whelming.
Wireless Wrkins.
Somewhere along the border
posits, arm;" officers are cerrtain.
there is a Mexican wireless in con
start communication with the Mexi
can ide. In fact, government operator-
have "listened in" on messages
sent from some mysterious station in
which military locations were re
vealed and revealed accurately.
If the American army has look
out station on the topn o" big- build
ings and the high mountain placAs
behind Ml Paso, the Mexican gov
ernment is no less represented. While
the Americans are survey Inp Juarez,
the Mexicans ar surveying the
American operations and the various
campt about the city.
Thus the news of the march of
the American command last week
when it was ordered out rf a prac
tice match was flashed to Mexico
! almost as t-oon as tlie nvve started
i:- the time th- troop.- had asKemi'- j

BULLETIN.
Inte: nntlon N vs Servi--:
WASHINGTON, June 28. An immediate declaration that a
state of war exists between the United States and Mexico was
demanded in an impassioned speech delivered in the house today
by "Uncle Joe" Cannon. The former speaker declared "the
status in Mexico should be recognized at once.' He asserted
that the republicans in the house would support legislation to
clarify the situation.
"The situation calls for action by congress,' he said, 'and
congress should act at once. A state of war exists between this
country and Mexico. It has existed for months. If we had
recognized it months ago we would not now be in the position
which we are in."
"Doesn't the gentleman think," interrupted Rep. E-tle of
Texas, "that the sooner we say so in plain words, and go in
there and clean up the better we will be off?"
"That is the very thing I'm trying to say," replied "Uncle
Joe."
