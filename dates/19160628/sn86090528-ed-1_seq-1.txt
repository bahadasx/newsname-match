DURBIN MAKES HIT
AS MOVIE PRODUCER
Presents "0. C. W." in Three Reels
Hamilton, Johnson and Dr. Wray
Give Entertaining Talks; Meet
Same Place Next Month
A grand rood, served by the Cut ho
llo ladies or the city, four grand talks
nnd a grand time of good fellowship
during both banquet and toasts, made
the Men's Dinner club meeting in the
dining hall of the Oklahoma College
for Women last night if possible a
greater success than any previous one.
Slightly less than one hundred busi
ness men of Chickasha attended, to be
exact. ii.".. One speaker stated that
ho hud traveled much hi the past few
years, touching ninny countries on
both hemispheres, and never before
hail he seen so many business men
of a city the size of Chickaslia at one
meeting, the purpose of which was
merely to meet and have a social good
time. j
President G. W. Austin was the )
' toastmastor. He was introduced by
D. II. Roche, president of the organl
zn ion. ,
President Austin demonstrated toj
Chickasfia people that happy faculty
lie possesses of putting an audience
perfectly at ease. He joked of the
method in which a number of business
men had clamored for places on the
program, and of how it had been nec
essary to limit the number to four
speakers, then limit them to speeches
of nine minutes each.
Attorney S. C. Durhin, t tie first speak
er, was introduced as one "who had
taken a greut interest in the College,
had been a frequent visitor in the halls
and had always been given a fitting
welcome by those whom ho had gone
out to see."
Three Reels by Durbin.
In a novel und interesting manner,
the speaker gave the response to his
(oust, "The Oklahoma College for Wo
men." It was a history of the college,
"in three reels." .
"The first reel of this picture Is
merely introductory," the speaker said,
"nn all first reels are. It is a picture
of the college as I first saw It. Com
ing from farther east and farther
north, I was prepared to hear creeks
called rivers and hills called moun
tains, but even then I was surprised
to find an institution which boarded
in the Ilohart Flats called a college."
After elaborating somewhat furth'T
on the humble beginning of the school.
Mr. Durbin presented the second reel' o clock this morning, was a com
of the picture, showing the institution I Plde surprise to their friends. Al
growing but struggling under heavy though it was known to many that the
odds, not the least of which was the event was scheduled for the near fu-
iinpression, first, that It was a place
for incorrigible girls, and second that
It was a school of no interest or profit
to the state, merely u plum the people
of Oklahoma thought Grady county
politicians obtained for their district.
During the second "reel," the politi
cians of the state themselves believed
that the school was a sort of cog in
the political machinery of Oklahoma,
places in which were to he used as
the exigencies of politics demanded.
"The third reel." the producer of
scenarios said, "takes us back to two
years ago. when the present head of
the institution took charge. We see
before us a real college, serving a real
purpose in the educational system of
the state and serving not just one lo
cality, but every section of the slate
Impartially."
"And it Is my hope that the third
leH be ml endless one." Toastmaster
Austin responded as Mr. Durbin con
cluded his toast.
The short talks made by President
Austin bett.-:en toasts were perhaps
t he most delightful of the entertain
re-nt "I have studiously avoided ail ; is a traveling salesman for the Dough
discussion of the matters treated in j ty-McDonald wholesale house, popular
the first two reels of the picture,"- he I with his associates and other triemis.
said, "but I can say for the third that
it does give a true picture of the col
lege as It Is today, an institution with
possibilities for this state that I fear
even none of you men realize."
Hamilton's Thunder Stolen.
Judge Eugene Hamilton was the next
speaker, introduced by the toastmas-
ter as one whose friendship he valued
very highly.
"I can't talk of war on such an oe-
casic-! us this because we would nol
agree. I can't speak of religion bo
cause I see there are two minister!
present, so I have decided to talk o
a subject on which we can all agree,"
the speaker began. - Ho spoke of the
Oklahoma College for Women, and its
relation to the educational system of !
the country.
Judge Hamilton first discussed
briefly the defects of a public school
education which has the preparation
of the student for the university in
view, though only one per cent of the
children ever reach college. He la
mented the lack of more vocational
and specialized training in the public
school system, and referred to the Ok-
lanoma college lor women as an liu
stitution that did correct these defects,
....... .
that did give a woman just tl train-
Ing that a woman s'uld have, and
that, above everything else,
taught
girls that work is not disgraceful, but
ennobling and elevating.
The Oklahoma College for Women
was referred to not only as the school
designed , to correct these evils, but
also as one that was actually accom
plishing the purpose, under the man
agement of President Ct. W. Austin.
Hands it to Austin.
The speaker here took occasion to
say that he had been very much op
posed to Mr. Austin when he came to
Chickaslia to take charge of the
school, but that after seeing his ac
complishments of two short years, he
could, with every other business man
in Chkkasha, "slap the president on
the back and tell him to go to it. old
man."
President Austin took this occasion
to tell the business men of Chickaslia
of his first year of struggle and deter
mination to show the possibilities of
the school, and of his Joy at being tak
en in by the men whose interests were
here, as a worker and as a friend
among them.
Ben F. Johnson's toast on "Thrift"
was followed by a twenty-minute en
tertainment by Itev. J. A. Wray on the
subject, "Travel and Kun." Dr. Wray
proved a master entertainer and his
talk was a fitting close to the banquet.
In speaking of the banquet this
morning, President Roche of the club
declared that il was so successful that
the next one would be held in the
same place, the Nellie Spsrks dining
hall, and that it would be held at the
regular date, the last Tuesday in the
mouth.
WEDDING IS
SURPRISE
Thy wedding of Miss Karle Turner
and Mr. James 15. Black, occurring at
ture, the date was not divulged, and
the wedding was kept secret until the
bridal couple had left Chickasha. Mar
riage announcements were sent out

The ceremony occurred at the home

I t01'ding t0 H,i"""'t8 lal th
' niw'tinB of 1,10 Dinner club Ist
night by Ben F. Johnson, of the First
National bank.
An outside capitalist is considering
erecting a six story building, IOOxIG.'i
feet, not the largest but absolutely the
best hotel in the state of Oklahoma
ii the, people of Chickasha want it
done, Mr. Johnson announced.
Rumors of the possibility of a new
hotel for this city have been circulat
ed freely on the streets for weeks, but
not until last night had any definite
statement been made on the matter
by anyone connected vith ' It. .To
sites for the hotel are being consid
ered. Mr. Johnson discussed briefly the
great need Tor a good hotel in Chick
asha. He stated that there were
many traveling people who never saw
Chickaslia because there were not ade
quate hotel accommodations here, that
the town was losing an immense
amount of revenue from this source
I alone. He then told of interesting an
outside man in the matter, and finally
of obtaining a proposition from him
to the people of Chickasha.
"Everything that a city obtains, it
must obtain at the expense of some
effort," he said. "The state, told us
that they would locate the Oklahoma
College for Women here if we would
deed them 100 acres of land, and this
same method of doing business is ex
tended clear down the scale of busi
ness transactions to the backyard de
partment, where the father tells his
son that if he will pick up the chips
around the wood pile, he will give him
i dime.
"This method of give and take has
become so prevalent that it is now al
most universal in deciding the loca
tion of large private enterprises," Mr.
Johnson continued. "Since there are
many cities willing and glad to give a
bonus for the location of large private
institutions of a quasi public charac
ter, it becomes necessary that others
meet the same conditions."
The proposition was this: The out
side capitalist wanted to build a ho
tel in Chickasha if the people were
willing to do their small part. For a
bonus of $l."i.000 he would erect the
building in this city, though two other
places were clamoring for a chance at
a similar offer.
Will Save City Money. f
"And it is a fitting topic to discuss
under the subject of Thrift,'" Mr.
Johnson continued in his talk. For
$1.".000you can get an investment of
$':,0.iMHi of outside capital in your
town. A few months ago we voted
bonds of $7.".0i0 to put up a junior
high school building. If this foreign
capital comes in, taxation revenues
from it will be nifficient to pay the
interest on these bonds and supply
the sinking fund necessary to redeem
them when they are due.
"In other words, by the payment of
$ 1 Ti.ttnO, the people of Chickasha can
obtain a tax revenue sufficient to buy
and pay for their new school building.
And the revenue vi!l continue after
the building is paid for."
Of the bonus, $7.rK is asked for
when work starts on the structure and
the remaining ST. "on when the hotel
is In operation.
It is understood that th develop
ment committee of the Commercial
and Farm bureau will consider ir.

OVER 8,000 TEACHERS
IN SUMMER SCHOOLS
Oklahoma City, June 2?. ( Special.)
Almost as many students are attend
ing the summer term of the state
schools this summer as there v. ere
teachers in Oklahoma five years ago.
Under date of June 2.1rd the registrars
reported the attendance for the Bum
mer terms as follows:
Fdniond Normal, Durant Nor-
nu'l, 9ifi: Weatherford Normal. 947;
Ada Normal. '07; Tahlequah Normal,
828; Alva Normal, 616; Tonkawa Pre
paratory school. 110; Claretnore Pt
paratory school, 1193; A. & M. Col
lege. 0'l7; State University, 902; U .al,
8,:!;7. All of these students are doing
credit work and practically all who
take the summer course will teacii in
some of Oklahoma's schools next year.
Five years ago the entire number of
(em bers In the state was :.2!5.
One of the first official ads of State
Superintendent Wilson was to organ
ize the summer schools on a credit
making basis, thus using the t ite's.
property eleven months in the year In
stead of K'.j months and giving those
who teach during the winter an oppor
tunity to attend school during the
Kumnicr as well as those students who
want to do advance standing work. It
((.ts but very little more to maintain
the schools with full summer term;
than for the regular term of nine
months.
