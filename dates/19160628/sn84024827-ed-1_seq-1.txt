be escected. It was dispatched yes-

gtrs has been unable to forecast the
action of the de facto government.
Prompt compliance by Congress to '
any recommendation the President

No Word From Carranza
Kliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambas
sador designate, said be had received
no intimation of the course his gov-
riiinent intended to pur3ue and had
not e-, en been advised of the receipt
of the American note. On his own
responsibil.ty. however, .he sent to the
State Deportment two communica
tions. One cr.mph'.ins against the en
forcement of a general embargo on :
shipments to Mexico; the other re
cites that Mexican citizens have been
arrested without cause in California
and Arizona. They warn Secretary
Lansing that the present situation be
tween the two governments cannot
fail to be gravely a?pr?vated by these
matters, although setting forth to the ;
ambassador that local authorities, not
ti e State Department, were responsi
ble. So far as is known the State De-.
partmt nt has not been advised of the
dotations of Mexicans. ,

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WA'"KFGANT, 111.. June 27. Wil-
lia-n H. Orpet, who elected to tell his
own story on the stand in refutation
of the charge of murdering Marion
l""tprt. completed a session today
winch left him pale and nervous.
The course of questions by David
R. Joselyn. for the state, abounded in
pitfalls and led the witness over a
route which twisted and turned and
dnut-'ed on itself with an insistence
which more than once caused the wit-
r,Pon to correct his testimony.
t
The young college student started i
the dav as if determined to retain his
COmp0sure at al! costs.
In an hoar, however, his composure
was eon. He , moved from side to
sife in his sept, twisted his fingers
and scarcely looked at his inquisitor.
For the most part his head was in
clined to one side, and he gazed out
nf corner of his eves in the gen
eral direction of the lawyer, but not
r.t him.
Orpet Nervous.
At one time one of the letters which
he wrote to Marion was left to his
rervous fincers. "Mr. Orpet," warned I
Attorney Joselyn, "please don't twist 1
t?!t letter as you 11 destroy it. The
courtroom was packed up to the very
edee of the judge's bench and on
either side of it mostly with women.
For the most part the testimony was
of an extremely embarrassing nature,
but ix did not ter the women from;
