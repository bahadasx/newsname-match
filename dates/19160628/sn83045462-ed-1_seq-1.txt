PRESIDENT WILLING
TO MEET CARRANZA
HALF WAYON ISSUE
Makes Condition That Reply
Due Today Must Show
Proper Spirit.
MAY MODIFY SLIGHTLY
STAND ON WITHDRAWAL
Concedes Presence of American
j
Troops Far in Interior Is Cause
For Irritation.
WAR DEPARTMENT IS BUSY
Army Heads. However, Are Grimly
Active, Despite Diplomatic Ex
changes and Outlook, Preparing
for Hostilities Across
Border.
Conditioned upon Carranza
showing the proper spirit in the
reply that is now believed to be
on the way to Washington to the
United States note of Sunday, and
that he does not take an inflexible
stand that will offend the sensibilities
of the American people,
President Wilson, it was indicated
in intelligent quarters today,
is willing to take up with
Carranza a plan of settlement of
the present differences that may
be effective.
The President, the Carranza people
now understand, will not consent to
the withdrawal of troops of this country
from Mexico, but the President Is
willing to concede, it is said, that the
presence of troops so far in the interior
of Mexico may be irritating, in
spite of the conditions under which
they went there.
Will Meet Garranza Half Way.
Assuming that Carranza will sincerely
oo-operate in efforts for
peace, after first conveying regrets
for the Carrlzal affair. President Wilson
will meet him half way and propose
plana that may bring a successful
settlement. The basis for this settlement
would, so far as the administration
Is conoerned, be the withdrawal of
United States soldiers to a peace zone
running along the entire border between
the United States and Mexico,
to a depth of something like forty
miles.
The soldiers of the United States
would patrol this zone, practically being
in possession of it, keeping out all
Mexicans except those upon legitimate
errands or authorised by the Mexican
government. This zone would remain
in possession of the United States until
the Carranza or some other government
had fully restored order in Mexico.
when it would again pass into the
hands of the Mexicans.
The administration is of the opinion
that public opinion all over the world
! would recognize this as fair and necessary
to the United States and as rej
moving the possibility of continued
| friction through the keeping at bay
of bandits trying to overrun the American
side of the border.
Note May Be on Way.
Believing that thare is now on the
way to Washington the answer of Gen.
Carranza to the last note of the State
Department demanding the release of
soldiers of the United States in a Mexican
prison and insisting that Carranza
make clear his purposes toward this
country. President Wilson today held
his hand as to Mexico and went on j
with much general executive business !
demanding his attention. He saw many J
visitors during the day.
At the War Department there was
no let up 'in activities. Officials high i
and low feverishly worked to the main
end of getting armed men to the Mex- '
lean border and to forward supplies to
thsas human fighting machines. The
wiraa hummed with orders and officials
? a.mere tnroughout the i
War Department conferring with one
another. Nothing was taken for granted
there.
Busy at War Department.
Acrose the etreet. in the executii'e office*.
and in the State Department there
was an easing up in the tension of the
!ast few days, due to the belief that
Carranza's answer is on the way.
There did not seem to be definite information
anywhere as to what the
Carranza answer will he, although there {
was an assumption that th?* Mexicanj
leader cannot afford to longer keep the
Americans in prison, and that his only i
wise course, if he really wants peace, is
to set these men at liberty.
Klesio Arredondo, the Carranza ambassador
designate, had received HO
word early this afternoon from his chief
about the status of the diplomatic negotiations
Mr. Arredondo has informed ;
Gen. Carranza of the determined senti- j
ment In the United States demanding'
the release of th? *
-? -- ?v troopers.
but had no reply.
Brief Telegram From Rodgers.
Special Agent Rodgers at Mexico City,
to a brief telegram received at the
State Department early today, said he !
expected to be handed today Carranza's 1
reply to the American note demanding
the release of the soldiers.
The message, containing but two1
sentences, was the first word the department
had heaid from Mr. Rodgers since
be reported the delivery of the United
States note.
Two cabinet officers and others close
to the President, although they had
not talked with him recently, expressed
opinions that the Carranza answer
would be here today and that it would
most likely be favorable.
That no official of the government,
was certain as to what the answer
will be, however. Is shown clearly in
the fa/t that the President has suaKidea
decision whether he will go to (
iladelphia tomorrow to address the ,
associated advertising men in annual j
convention there. The President In- j
landed to leave tomorrow morning and ,
nsek to the advertising men at 4;
hffeloek tomorrow afternoon. Ho ha 1
I4M at a lata hour today whether ,
he would make the trip. Everything
depended on the Mexican answer.
Much Depends on Answer.
Should Carranza have failed to meet
the demands the President, instead of
going to Philadelphia tomorrow, he will
go to Congress and lay the Mexican
situation before that body, with a request
for authority to proceed as he
thinks best to protect the interests and
honor of the United States. If the
answer is favorable, as many today believed
it would be, the President will
go to Philadelphia.
The President also has an engagement
to attend the annual banquet of
1 the New York Press Club in that city
| Friday night, but the filling of that
will also depend upon events.
The opinion was advanced today by
a well informed man who has talked
both with the President and Secretary
Lansing that Carranza's delay in sending
his answer to the note of last Sunday
is due to the fact that he has been
in communication with the Central and
South American republics, seeking to
line them up with Mexico in the pending
difficulty, and informing them of
his intentions that they may have opportunity
to express their views and
commit themselves to his policies, whatever
they may be. The same man was
of the opinion that Carranza will disavow
the Carrizal "incident," but at ,
the same time place the blame upon ,
the American soldiers to a large extent.
He is expected to indicate that Gen.
Trevino went farther than had been expected,
but that the aggravation to the
Mexican troops was severe.
Disavowal Must Carry Release.
This disavowal would carry with it
the release of the soldiers and go far
toward mollifying the relations of the
two countries. This man has also received
the impression that in seeking
to satisfy the United States Carranza
will plainly propose that American
troops now in Mexico be withdrawn
farther toward the border and may intimate
that he will be satisfied if the
troops are kept within a certain zone
just south of the border, thereby insuring
protection to American territory
and people.
in iaci, tnis idea of a zone of thirty
or forty miles below the American bolder
in which troops of the United
States may operate to prevent bandits
reaching: territory of the United States ,
is today looming: up as the possible
compromise for the settlement of the
troubles with Mexico. The administration
will not consent to the troops
leaving Mexican territory entirely, but
it would, according: to good information
today, probably agree to a plan
of settlement by which this country's
soldiers would practically police a zone
extending thirty or forty miles below 1
the border, thereby keeping off bandits
while Carranza is trying to bring 1
peace in other portions of his domain. (
Would Sacrifice Political Future.
The President is represented as so
keenly desirous of keeping peace with
Mexico that he is willing, if necessary,
to sacrifice his political future.
He has an abhorrence of settling the 1
difficulties with Mexico along lines that J
might benefit himself. In a talk he i
had today with Senator Lewis of Illinois,
he told the Illinois senator that he
sincerely hoped that whatever de- .
bates take place in Congress they 1
would be along non-partisan lines. He <
especially hoped that his particular
friends in Congress would elevate their *
remarks on this subject far above poll- i
tics, seeking no credit for what the ad- ?j
ministration has sought to do in Mex- I
ico and makinsr no attnrlr? * 12
opposing: party speakers. 1
Members of the foreign affair^ eoro* |
mittee of the House were studying
precedents today with a view to preparing
for an expected fight over what J
action Congress should take on the 1
Mexican situation. One resolution i
particularly favored in the informal <
discussion, and which may be presented <
to President Wilson for approval, would
declare that a state of war exists; that
the President's course with respect to
Mexico is approved by Congress and
authorize him to use the army, National
Guard, Navy and Marine Corps
and authorize him to call for volunteers.
This resolution, while not put
into final form, was talked over among
House leaders today without any final
conclusion.
Believe Carranza Will Evade .
Mr. Rodgers* message to the State Department,
dated yesterday, said that it
was believed that the Mexican authorities
are investigating the Carrizal affair. His
statement was interpreted here as indicating
rather that the reply wobld support
previous assertions that American troops
were responsible than that a change of
attitude was to be expected. Gen. Gomez,
commanding the Mexican detachment at
Carrizal, was killed in the fight. Lacking
his knowledge of what was said at his

w??w?vv mut XJVJU JUDl UC1UIC .
the tiring begain. it was deemed im- ,
probable that the de facto officials would
find anything in the reports of his sub- ;
ordinates Justifying a change in views. j
Report From Pershing Awaited. j
A final report on the Carrlzal fight 1
from Gen. Pershing is still awaited j
here. Capt. Morey's report was re- t
ceived last night. As coming from the
only American officer known to survive.
it has great weight with administration
officials. It was pointed out
today, however, that he did not know *
personally all that had happened. His t
account must be supplemented by that ,
of troopers who were with Capt. Boyd ?
at the conference with Gen. Gomez.
The War Department anticipates that t
Gen. Pershing will submit a formal ac- j
count, based on all the reports he has
obtained from survivors. A board of 1
officers may be assigned by the field ?
commander to assemble this account.
The position of the Washington government
as to responsibility for the 1
clash will be founded on this final re- i
port. Preliminary statements from <
Gen. Pershing have indicated that the
Mexicans will be held responsible for |
opening fire, since they had been ad- ,
vised in writing by Capt. Boyd of his ]
peaceful purposes.
CARRANZA IS REPORTED i
ANXIOUS TO AVOID WAR j
Said to Have Notified Editor of Mexican
Labor Paper He Will Do
Anything to Prevent Break.
John R. Silliman. consul at Saltillo,
who now is at Eagle Pass, Tex., today
advised the State Department of the
receipt by Dr. Atl. editor of a Mexico
City labor paper, of a telegram from
Gen. Carrarua saying he was prepared
to do everything possible to avoid a
break with the United States. Dr. Atl
has been at Eagle Pass participating in
conferences designed to aid in averting
war, and is expected to come to Washington
this week to confer with the
executive council of the Amerioan
Federation of Labor.
Samuel Gompers late yesterday telegraphed
Luis Marones and other Mexican
labor leaders at Eagle Pass that the
executive council of the American Federation
of Labor would be pleased to meet
here with a delegation of organized workers
of Mexico Saturday or before. Mr.
Gompers' message was sent In reply to
one saying Mexican workers wished to
meet the executive council for the realD
sation of its "pacifist program."

Blamed on Villa Followers.
The bandit raid near Hachita, which
resulted In the murder of William Parker
and his bride, still was a subject of
speculation today in connection with the
presence of the former Villa followers In
Juarez and the apparent lack of protection
afforded the border from bandit raids.
Their probable activities in the event of '
hostilities save rise to numerous alarmist
theories.
Although the embargo of munitions is
still enforced rigidly at points of entry,
that regarding food is not. Several wagon
loads of foodstuffs held up at the international
bridge were released today after
the consignors received permission from
Washington to send them across in re- I
sponse to protests against detention of
the goods. That the food shortage is becoming
more acute in the interior of
Mexico was declared by arrivals from the
south, who told of bread lines in Chihauhau
City, Durango and Torreon and
brought pictures to substantiate their ]
statements.
Organizing "Dynamite Squads."
Mexican refugees who reached the
border today from the mining districts
of southern Chihuahua brought stories
of the organization of "dynamite
squads" in Gen. Trevino's army. They
said it is planned that should it become
apparent in the event of war that
the de facto troops could not hold the
railroads, to destroy them, and the detachments
now stationed along the I
Mexican Central and the Mexican I
Northwestern will be concentrated at
Chihuahua City. Bombs and hand ;
grenades, it was said, were being made
by plugging the ends of small pipes
after filling them with powder, nails
and scrap iron.
Arrival of the first national guardsmen
is being awaited with interest.
Arrangements virtually have been com- '
pleted for their camp sites, provisioning
and drilling by regular army officers.
The largest guard since the present ^
crisis develoDed was stationed laRt
night at the international bridges, al- 1
though no fear was expressed that e
should an outbreak occur an attempt

It was believed that should a foray

POLITICAL FIGHT
SOON UNDER WAY
Appointment of National
Chairman Willcox Signal i
for the Opening.
EACH OF PARTIES TO HAVE
NEW YORK HEADQUARTERS
Progressives to Aid the Regular Republicans
in Framing Up and
Conducting Campaign.
With the selection yesterday of William
R. Willcox of New York as chairman
of the republican national committee,
following the previous naming by
the democrats of Vance McCormlck of
Pennsylvania as their national chairman,
the presidential campaign will
nrov Bnth rhnlrmen
will have headquarters in New York
city, and there will be branch headquarters
in Chicago.
The selection of Mr. Willcox was not
a surprise. He has long been a close
friend of Candidate Hughes and accompanied
Mr. Hughes when the latter
left Washington to take up his residence
in New York. Mr. Willcox was :
the first chairman of the public service <
commission of New York under appintment
of Gov. Hughes. President :
Roosevelt appointed him postmaster of ,
New York city, and he served from
1905 to 1907. He is a friend of Col.
Roosevelt, and his neighbor at Oyster
Bay. It is assumed by republicans here
that his appointment as national chairman
will be satisfactory to the progressive
republicans. Mr. Willcox is a .
lawyer, fifty-three years of age, and is
well known to politicians in New York
state.
Will Consult Freely.
It is understood here among republicans
that Mr. Willcox will be in con- ]
etant touch with such republican leaders
as former Senator Murray Crane,
former Senator Hemenway of Indiana,
Senator Penrose, Senator Gallinger (

the executive committee in the conduct
of the campaign.
Also it is said that leaders formerly
identified with the active management
of the progressive party will form part
of Chairman Willcox's "cabinet," and '

that in the determination of important
questions arising in the campaign the
progressives will be consulted as freely j
as the men hitherto affiliated with j
what is known as the "old guard." j
In republican circles emphasis is laid j
upon the statement that no occasion
will be offered for the suggestion that
the direction of the affairs of the republican
party in the coming campaign
is monopolized by any faction
or group of men. Attention is called
to the letter of Candidate Hughes to
Col. Roosevelt thanking him for his
support, in which he strongly urged
the colonel to give him all the support
and advice possible.
Gov. Johnson's Message Pleases.
Republican leaders in Washington e
were pleased today over the dispatch
from Sacramento quoting Gov. Hiram ]
W. Johnson, one <Jf the progressive \
leaders, as cordially supporting the j
candidacy of Mr. Hughes. "I believe
his record warrants it," Gov. Johnson <
was reported as saying !!

A dispatch from Seattle says that
Ole Hanson, one of the leading bull
moo8ers of the state of Washington
and candidate for United States sen- b
ator in 1914, has refused to follow Col. k
Roosevelt and has announced that he b
will vote for President Wilson. In a o:
