H by five candidates for Governor be1
fore an audience of between 2,000
H and 2,500 people, in which there
[ were many iaaies, mucu w
the old-time enthusiasm in Greenwood
today. There was a noticeable
lack of demonstrations as characterized
campaign metings here in the
past, and there was absolutely no
heckling, a reminder of the countyto-county
canvass of 1912 and 1914
Each speaker wa, with possibly a
slight exception of two, accorded the
very best attention. i
The Meeting Opens.
At 11 o'clock Dr. E. J. Smith
opened the meeting with prayer.
There was some delay on account
of a misundertanding either as to
the opening hour or who was to
speak first. Dr. Smith prayed that
the campaign "be one of high ideals."
Chairman W. H. Nicholson took
only a minute or two to say-that he
expected tKe audence to give every
candidate "a fair and square deal."
He asked, at the request of candidates,
that there be no disturbance
Jby cranking of machines, etc.
Cole L. Blame.
Former Gov. Blease, the first
speaker was received with a few
"hurrahs for Blease." He explained
that he was iate because an agreement
had been reached to have the
candidates for) Governor speak last.
He declared he is advocating several
ssues in his platform and mentioned
first the state wareshouse system
inaugurated when he was Governor.
Properly handled he declared
1 it is a benefit to the farmers. Mr.
Blease said he favors a 6 per cent
rate of interest for the ordinary citizen.
Corporations are able to get it
at a much less rate.
He wants the constitution so
amended that the Governor can call
an extra session of court "for certain
cases" and thus save the expense
of delays. He also favors
striking out the $2,000 to be paid in
"certain cases." Biennial sessions of
the Legislature are advocated. Under
the present system laws are passed
and judges and solicitors do not know
/what they are before they have to
pass on them.
Mr. Blease wants the common
school system built up and is opposed
to give the higher schools so much
money. "I wouldn't do a college
any harm," he says, "but they are
getting too much money in comparison
with the common schools, v In
many cases poor people derive no
benefit"

a pension only for "real, genuine
Confederate soldiers" and not to
"those who claim to have been in the
war and have not."
Turning around, the former Governor
asked: "Is the Governor here?'
When told Mr. Manning was not the

ing, and I will say nothing oernna
his back."
"He ought to be here,*' cried a
Blease admirer in the audience.
The speaker then said he would
take the court records ince Gov.
Manning has been at the head and
show that the administration has
been one of the most lawless in years
He cited instances of criminal
assaults and nots and as to blind
tigers said: "They may have run out
the blind one, but they say nothing
about those that can see." .* \
Mr. Blease ridiculed the claim that
the ^sylum has been improved, say- i
ing the work "Blease was trying to
do they have spent $300,000 in doing."
Mr. Blease began to "warm up"
part of his audience when he declared
that he was "Governor, the only
Governor four years." If elected
again he said he would be Governor
of all the people.
He criticized the creation of useless
offices, mentioning the Tax Commission,
with a chairman who pays
only a poll tax, the board of concilia- j
tion and the board of charities and ,
tion and the board of charities and |
correction. The only thing this board ,
has done has been to try to clean
up the penitentiary "when Blease
had already done that." He declared
he had no apologies to make and if
he gets back he won't pardon that
many again, "because there are not
that many left." j
As to why he didn't reduce taxes
Mr. Blease said: "You know if I had
sent a mesage to the Legislature <
saying the Ten Commandments were ,
good law the Legislature would have
said no it is not."
In closing Mr. Blease asked his |
hearers to take the record and vote |
for the men who will sustain thf
TlTOs. ' " ???
1 R. A. Cooper.
Mr. Cooper was received with considerable
applause. He opened by
referring to his conscientious work
as solicitor of this district. He declared
he asked no one's permission
to enter this rape and he believed the ,
people would vote for a man on his
merits. "If I have to win by pulling
down a man and if I have to get fav<jr
by criticizing another man I will
remain a private citizen. Measure
me by the Democratic standard."
Mr. Cooper said a governor could
promote the happiness of the people
or make it a land of chaos. "If elected
I will take an oath and so' help me
God I will keep it." He would not
set aside the verdicts of juries with- I
out a thorough investigation. ' He
favors one measure of punishment,
the law so administered that its very
administration shows it to be correct
in theory as well as in fact.
Education.
Mr Cooper said his most important
issue was education. Ninety per cent
of the children in South Carolina, he
said, would get education only in the
schools nearest them. He said it
ought to be the set policy of this
state to give these schools the same
training they get in the first two
years of college work.
It is unfair, said Mr. Cooper, for
the state colleges to give free tuition |
to 5 per cent of the boys and girls
while all the people pay the taxes.
He favors permitting young men to
go through college free and pay back
after they have finished. He declared

at a Business College at Columbia
and has come home. . He got here *
last Friday in the midst of the war ^
excitement and was resolved to do a

mother to allbw him to enlist for the
big fight. He had his speech made 1
up and he was going to speak it with
determination; he was going to use
all the persuasion he could muster, n
but he was-going 4a war or "bust." J
His ardor cooled down and the itch f<
in his heel ceased to worry him when
his mother told him that she thought a
to enlist and go to Mexico would be a
a "nice trip for him." v
