CITY WINS SUIT.
Tax Case With S. W. Potter Handed
Down Favorable to Corporation
of Crossville.
Last week the Court of Civil Apoeals
rendered its decision in the case of S.
W. Potter vs. Corporation of Crossville
in tavor ot the city.
It will be remembered that S. VV.
Potter sought to evade payment of
taxes claimed by the city and claimed
that the taxes were illegally assessed
in that the city charter made no provi
sion for the assessmnet and collection
of taxes.
The case was brought before Judge
a. H. Roberts in chambers seeking an
lnjuuction restraining the city from
collecting the taxes. Judge Roberts
declined to grant the injunction and
pending the time of taking proof in tne
case, tne city, on the advice ot attor
C. E. Keyes, passed an ordinance
specifying how taxes should be assess
ed and collected. When the case came
on for a hearing before Judge Roberta
he held that while the charter did not
set out specifically the authority for
levying and collecting taxes that such
authority was implied, and, further, in
the event the charter should prove to
be lame on the point of not especially
delegating to the city the power to
levy and collect taxes, that that detect
could be cured by ordinance, which had
been done. On those grounds Judge
Koberts decided the case adversely to
Mr. Potter. Mr. Potter then appealed
the case with the result that the high
er court, which is the one of last re
sort, decided against him also. That
settles the case from the point of iur
ther litigation, but there will be a bill
of cost for Mr. Potter to pay that will
amount to considerable.
WAR SITUATION,
Strong Indications That War Must Come
With Mexico Soon.
War bas not been formally declared
between the United States and Mexico
but the attitude of Mexico is such that
peace does not seem probable muck
longer.
President Wilson has demanded the
immediate surrender of the 17 negro
cavalrymen captured by the Mexicans
when they ambushed our men about a
weeq ago and killed close to 100, in
cluding the captain
President Carranza has been asked
to explain it the act was in conformity
with instructions ot the Mexican gov
ernment and if he proposed to assume
responsibility. An early answer was
demanded and that the answer come
through the regular diplomatic chan
nels and not throufig any subordinate
officer. The whole situation now rests
with Mexico whether there will be
peace or war.
The militia from all the states is be
ing gotten in shape to move as rapidly
as possible. New York will likely be
the first state to send troops to the
border. Tennessee troops are mobiliz
ing at Nashville and getting ready as
rapidly as possib e. Tension is strong
and fighting is likely to take place any
time.
Some of the Central and South
American countries are offering to act
as mediators but this government does
not think there is anything to mediate.
m Europe fighting is going on around
Verdun with its usual intensity with I
slight gams for the Germans. The
Germans have gone to the relief of the
Austrians, who were being pushed back
by the Russians, and the Rusaisn ad
vance has been brought to a halt. The
Turks have halted the advance of the
Russians also and little seems to be the
gains by any of tbe contending powers.
Citizens Will Urge City Fathers to Clean
Up and Improve Drainage
Conditions
In response to the movement inaug
urated by the Cumberland County
Business Association, a mass meeting;
of the citizens of Crossville was held
in the court house Monday night and
the question of fighting a threatened
typhoid epidemic was discussed.
Talks were made by numerous citi
zens led by Dr. V. L. Lewis with the
result that the following
RESOLUTION WAS PASSED:
Whcras, it is evident from the gen
eral discussions here tonight, that the
health and sanitary conditions of our
town are not what they should be, and
since the sanitary conditions and the
much dreaded housefly everywhere are
responsible for many diseases such as
typhoid fever tuberculosis, etc, there
for be it resolved :
First, that this meeting most urgent
ly request the City Board of Mayor and
Aldermen to take such steps as may be
n .cessary to improve these conditions.
Second, That the Chairman of tbis
meetng appoint a committee of throe
to confer witn the Board ot Mayor and
Aldermen as to ways and means to
bring about improved conditions, and
that the Chairma n of this meeting be
made ex-officio chairman of this com
mittee. Third, We recommend that this com
mittee arrange a meeting for as early
i a date as possible with tne Board of
: Mayor and Aldermen in order that lm
I mediate action be taken.
' While the response to tbe call for a
mass meeting was not so large as it
should have been, the best e.'ement of
the community was much in evidence
and manifested deep interest in the
question of improved sanitary condi
I tlona for our lowu.
The committee appointed to confer
with the Hoard of Mayor an Alder
men is: A. L. Garmson, Chairman,
V. L. Lewis, G. A. Haley, Sampson
DeKossett, J. L. Quails. Our people
may be sure that these gentlemen will
present the case with fairness and
force and that they will receive a cour
teous hearing and that action will be
practically sure to follow soon and
along the proper lines.
By some means a wrong understand
ing of the purpose ot the Cumberland
County Business Association has found
1 dgement in the minds of some people
of Crossville and over the county. The
feeling seems to be on the part ot
some that this organization is composed
soley of business men and that none
other are expected to join or take an
interest in its work and objects. That
is an entirely mistaken position. The
organization was created to fill a press
ing need that faces every town that
makes progress and accomplishes
things the mo&t useful for the public.
The organization meets the second
Mo-day night of each month at 8
o'clock and it wilt giadly welcome any
peison, man or woman, as a member
or with their counsels whether they
are a member or not. It is the object
of the Association to extend all possible
aia to every movement tsiat is for the
betterment of Crossville or the coun
ty, several who are not citizens of
Crossville are members and the Asso
ciation extends a cordial invitation to
all citizens of the county to either be
come members or give us their person
al aid and encouragement in every good
movement.
DROWNED IN EMORY KIVEK.
Two negro boys 12 and 14 years of
age were dro vned in Emory river at
Harriman Sunday afternoon while
bathing. Neither of them could swim
and when they got in water beyond
their depth they were unable to get out
and as no one was near to rescue them
they quickly drowned.
