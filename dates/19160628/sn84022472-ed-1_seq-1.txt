!New Inquiry Into Dairy Will
Ee Made, Now, By City's
Health Officer, Following
Report From State Bac
teriological Laboratory on
Milk Supply From Milf ord
1 Farm.
Ir. "E. A. McLellan, health officer of
ft&ridgepbrt. whose inspectors reported
ito him last week that the herd of
cows at Beaver Brook Dairy, Milford.
were free from infection that might
result in the glandular diseases that
have been fatal in Bridgeport, today
issued orders for another inspection
of the herd.
His order followed a telephone com
munication from. .."George" ;.JB:: HiH,
health officer of. Fairfield county. Mr.
Hill had "been in communication with
Ir. E. T. Conn, who has charge of the
i Connecticut bacteriological labora
tory. '
Dr. Conn's report was puhlished in
Associated . Press despatches - last
night. It was to the effect that sam
( i pies of milk sent from this vicinity
I had been examined and. found to in-
dicate the presence of streptococci."
Dr. Conn, the Beaver Brook Dairy
: and- others in ' interest today freely
t criticized the Bridgeport health au
jthorities for the situation that has re
j suited. The examination by the
j Bridgeport officials last week resulted
' ln announcement that the health de-
.' Ipartment had given , a clean bill of
health to the Milford farm. Now
the Milford farm has refused to sell
more milk, until the whole situation
has been gone over and there is abso
lutely no danger of disease from the
- -use of their milk supply.
The Beaver Brook farm takes the
i&ttitude that the safeguards for the
.public, ""in every instance, up to date,
'have been given through their own
initiative, while the Bridgeport health
authorities have failed to meet the
emergencies. ' - ...
v ; Dr. McLellan, defending the city
department, again points out the lack
of adequate facilities for such an
emergency, here, and emphasizes, the
.need jot a municipal pasteurization

bacteriologists agree with his attitude
arguing that the presence of disease

Is most difficult of detection.
Three new deaths are added to the
list of those due to glandular infec
tion. They are:
Mrs. K. Oscar Perry, Milford,
who died on Saturday.
An infant grandchild of Mrs.
Perry, who died yesterday.
Mrs. W. P. Grlppin, Devon, who.
died last night.
Although it was reported yesterday
'that samples of sputum of employes of
the dairy had been sent to Middletown,
for examination. Dr. Conn, on the tele
phone today told the' Farmer that no
jpuch samples- had been received there.
' He adds that he never has received di

PHYSICIAN, HEAD
OF HEALTH DEPT.
CALLEDTO ARMS
Dr. F. W.-Stevens. Former
Captain of Hospital Corps,
Leaves "For Duty.
An executive position in the munici
pality was vacated today through the
crisis in Mexico. Dr. F. W. Stevens,
president of the board of health, re
ceived a telephone call x this morning
from General Cole to report atr once in
Niantic. At 11:30 o'clock he was on
his way to camp.
The departure of the physician was
hurried. "With no warning, and con
sequently no time to make arrange
ments for the care of his city posi
tion and his practice, he was called
to the colors. He had to leave his
family and his patients for the press
ing call to dnty. ' " ' ,
As soon as he received the telephone
message, Dr. Stevens sent word to the
office; of Mayor Wilson that some ar
rangements should be made to take
his place as a member of the health
board, as- he didn't know how long
he'd be gone. , The likelihood that he
will soon start for the South is strong;
At the health department offices, he
left word with the attaches that if the
mayor made no other arrangements,
the board probably could conduct the
business of the department with three
members. ' v
He had time only to say good-bye
to. his family thereafter, and to prom
ise to write.r
Dr. Stevens was on the reserve. He
had. been a captain of the Hospital
Corps. All the reserve physicians
and surgeons were" called out this
morning. '- . ,

SCHULTZ'S PLEA

Lack of Harmony in City
Hall Office Displeases Re
publican Aldermen.
V
Town Clerk Joseph A. Schultz, who
recently caused much gossip in Re
publican circles by disagreements with
employes, which were followed by 'dis
charges, wants jtwo more women
clerks. Last night he cornered the
members of the ordinance committee
in the corridor of the city hall and
put in a plea for additional help. He'll
probably be turned down.
According to Mr. Schultz, he's over
burdened with city business. He told
the member? of the committee that an
ordinance should be proposed, provid
ing for two clerks at $700 each, in
addition to the prasent force.
Mr. Schultz didn't appear before the
regular meeting of the committee,
as many persons other than commute
members were at a hearing there, in
cluding , newspaper reporters. He
corralled the committee members near
the elevator shaft in the corridor and
told them to see what they could
dq.
The committee isn't favorable to the
plan. They let Mr. Schultz down
easy, but it isn't expected he will get
the clerks.
Persons who have had experience
about the office " of the town clerk,
through doing business there, assert
that all that is necessary is to hire
a couple of girls to work a month or
so, in order that the work may catch
up. Efficiency in the executive posi
tion, not more help, is needed, they
say.

John Flood, delegate from Fairfield
County to the recent Progressive na

will ship a large packing box to Col.
Theodore Roosevelt at Oyster Bay, L.
I. Among other things, the packing
box will contain:
Five bandannas, emblems of the
Bull Moose 'Party.
Seven assorted photographs of
the Big Bull Mooser.
A dozen Roosevelt campaign
banners. .
Miscellaneous collection of
Roosevelt buttons and badges.
Personal letters from the Colo
nel to John. ; ' ,
Roosevelt literature used by the
Progressive- campaign committees. ...
And a short. , expressive letter
from John to the Colonel.
The letter, in effect, will say that
Mr. Flood is "cured." Once a most
rabid Roosevelt follower, Mr. Flood
is back from the 'Progressive conven
tion, mad clean through. The con
duct of the convention byv which Mr.
Flood and some 900 other delegates
were jollied along for a week and then
dumped by the Colonel has changed
the Bridgeport Mooser.
He's going to tell the Colonel so, too,
in a few well-chosen words. The let
ter accompanying the aforementioned
packing box, will request that the con
tents of the box be used for a bonfire
to drive away' the mosquitoes . at
Oyster Bay, some one of these warm
summer evenings.

Camp Holcomb, Conn., ' June 28
This mobilization -camp for the Con
necticut National Guard, denuded of
infantry, cavalry, and supplementary
troops, except for Troop A. of New
Haven, was entirely given over to the
preliminary work of training recruits
today.
Major J. R. Richard North, second
infantry, a reserve officer, is in com
mand. To him began reporting today
the other reserve officers who will ben
assigned to the depot battalion of five
companies of infantry to be compos
ed almost wholly of recruits, most of
them very raw material. These re
cruits will be hardened and taughtN
military routine, then sent to the East
Haven range for rifle practice, and
when fit will be forwarded by de
tachments to the Connecticut com
mand wherever they may be along
the- Mexican border.
There are several hundred recruits
in camp. More than half are those
who recruited to fill companies to
war strength before the orders to go
into. camp came. These recruits ex

of buildings for the Remington inter
ests, is now the head of the entire
guard system of both plants.
All the uniformed guards of the

guards in both plants will have to
take their orders from Mr. Davies,

listed but those who joined the colors
afterwards will have to take a chance
of getting into the company in which
they desire to go as they will be chief
ly used to fill up ranks and equalize
commands which are below the maxi
mum strength. This assimilation
probably will not be for several weeks.
The recruits have a long and hard
period of training ahead.
The backbone of the commands
will be made by working in the three
hundred or more militiamen who re
main here to fill out short terms of
their enlistments under the Dick law.
Many of these well trained and sea-
soned men expect to be appointed to
feel keenly the circumstances which
keep them here.

James Haggerty, of Company C, who
was second in seniority in the regi
ment. Captain Carter beiivg his senior,
is the senior line officer among the
instructors.
The Yale batteries will come here
probably by Saturday under Major
Danrford, U. S. A., for a four weeks
drill period. There ' is plenty of room
here for field drill and it is not neces
sary ' for the batteries to go to East
Haven. The batteries need 12 .farriers
and 14 cooks, more supplies and equip
ment, but they witl move when these
are obtained without waiting for moVe
men, trusting to recruits coming here.
Upon the departure of the second
regiment the postal arrangements in
camp were left with Private Philip
Brady, who has been in the Tale post
office and who was assigned to work
under Chaplain Petty of the second
infantry in tlrat regiment. As Brady
is - "rookie" he stayed behind. Chap
lain Petty arranged that all mail for
the second regiment men arriving at
the camp wil be forwarded in closed
pouches direct to Nogales, Ariz., as it
would be impossible to handle it en
route and to have it following the reg
iment from station to station would
involve great labor and endless bother
and delay. The mails have included
quantities af parcel post matter. Sim
ilar arrangements have been made in
the first infantry. The letter box in
camp was obtained Sunday morning
by Chaplain Petty who m the rain
and before he preached a sermon went
into Niantic village, coi-.mandeered a
box which was in storage from the
postmaster, and, although it weighed

State Department Hears That Answer of De Facto
Government May Be Handed to Our Envoy
Today Hope For Mediation Said To Be Cans- ,
ing Carranza Delay No Change in Program j
Outlined By Administration For Next Step By j
United States.
'Washington, June 28 Special Agent Rodgers at Mexico
City, in a brief telegeram dated yesterday and received at the '
estate department today, said he
ranza s reply to the American note demanding .the release of,
soldiers taken prisoner at Carrizal.
The message, containing but two sentences, wes the first j
word the department had heard from Mr. Rodgers since he re- i
ported the delivery of the note.
Carranza's delay in replying is believed here to be due large-!
ly to his hope to have South and Central American countries!
agree fully to his course before he takes a final step.
There was nothing , today to indicate that the Washington!
government's position had undergone any change. ,
Officials still expected President Wilson" to go to Congress
tomorrow if Carranza failed to act or replied unfavorably. '
Any thing short of immediate release of the American itroop-ers-will
be unsatisfactory. -
No suggestions or proposal of negotiations in this regard
will be accepted. .
It was pointed out today that Secretary Lansing's note, pre
senting the demand sought to open no discussion of the Carrizal
incident. The fact that the men were captured and were being
held-was viewed as a hostile, act. requiring immediate repudia
tion by the de facto government through" the release of the pris
oners., .
Mr. Rodgers statement that Car
ranza officials appeared to be conduct
ing an inquiry into the. Carrizal clash
was interrupted here as indicating
rather that the reply would support
previous assentions that American
troops were responsible, than that a
change of attitude was to beexpect
ed. While it will not effect the general
p61icy of the government, a final re
port on the Carrizal fight from Gen
eral Pershing is awaited. j f
The . only actaal account of Captain
Morey must be supplemented by
troopers who were with Captain Boyd.
A board- of officers may be assigned
by General Pershing to assemble a re
port based on the stories of all com
manders. EUzeo Arredondo, the - Carranza
ambassador designate, still had re
ceived no word early today from his
chief about the status of the diplomat
ic negotiations. Mr. Arrendondo has
informed General Carranza of the de
termined sentiment in the United
States in demanding Ujie release of the
American troopers but has made no
reply.
President Wilson had a busy day.
He received a long line of Senators
and Representatives and shook hands
with more than a hundred persons.

problem.

Nogales' Ariz., June 28 American
occupation of Nogales, Sonora, loomed
close early today when eight Mexican
soldiers were driven back by a United
States sentry post as they tried to
cross to the American side. The Mex
icans withdrew and Major William
Brooke ordered his men to "drop

If a shot comes from over there we
will go straight across."
Shots were exchanged shortly be
fore midnight last night between .a

The corporal in charge of the post

cans, that they continued to advance

were well over the line they fired a

squad to fire, retreating to a point 150
yards north of the line to prevent be

There was no disagreement, how
ever, over the main feature of the res

guardsmen and the provision to per

more anxious for immediate action on
