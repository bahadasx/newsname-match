There will be a band concert in Acad

to ask parents of children who attend to
see that they are kept quiet during the
rendition of the several numbers. A re
quest of this nature should be sufficient.
Death of Mrs. J. J. Dillon
The many Lamoille County friends of
Mrs. John J. Dillon of Hardwick were

Kennedy officiating. Interment was in
St. Theresa's cemetery in Hyde Park.
The bearers were three brothers and
James Dillon of Quincy, Mass. Included
in the beautiful floral tributes was a
wreath of carnations and lillies from the
K. of C. lodge of Hard wick.

qualities and her death, where her pres
ence in the home seems so urgent.
greatly regretted by a very large circle of
friends. She was an untiring worker in
the church and will be greatly missed by
tne meniDers ot tt. Norbert s. I he sym

This Ice Box Saves You Money
Big ice bills indicate a poorly con
structed ice box. More than tHat,
they indicate that unless you contin
ually feed ice, you waste money in
food and risk the health of the family
by not properly protecting the food
in warm weather.
The ice boxes we will show you
are bu.lt to last lor years and give
perfect service. Their construction
makes the ice last longer, and a low
temperature is maintained in the
food chambers constantly. They
actually save you their cost many
is times over.
