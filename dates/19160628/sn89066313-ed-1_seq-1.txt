'iWOMEl MIKE PLANS'TO HAVE EXTRA GAME
J Mass Meeting Arranges for'
Social to Be Given Next
Monday Evening.
That every Summer Session wom
an should be helped to get all the
mental, physical and social training
possible during the remaining weeks
of school was the sentiment voiced
at the mass meeting of University
women at Read Hall jesterday. About
twcnty-fie attended.
Miss Gladys Baker was appointed
chairman of the meeting. She made
a plea for the girl who is studying too
hard and who does not take enough
exercise and recreation along with
her work.
Miss Dorothy Kaucher spoke on the
recreations offered in the Summer
Session. She mentioned tennis, swim
ming, gymnasium work and the pic
ture show. She urged that we set
aside one evening a week for an infor
mal, get-acquainted gathering of all
the women of the University.
Miss Eva Johnston, adviser of wom
en, suggested games, storj telling,
music, singing and domcing. She also
advised that all the girls be reminded
that the porch on the south side of
Read Hall is a cool, delightful place
to study.
"Generally speaking, two classes of
women come to the Summer Session
those who come to have a good time
and those who come to work, nnd
each class takes it too seriously," said
.Miss Anna Carney, who has attended
six summer sessions.
It was finally decided ta have the
next social at Read Hall next Mon-
day evening. An attempt will be made
to notify every girl in the University
by announcements and posters. Mag
azines will be ready, and a xictrola
will play for those who prefer to
dance.
rUH TO TALK OK i'OLT SHOW
Program Is Announced for Commer
cial Luncheon Tomorrow.
The fCOO mule-colt ring to be giv
en on Friday, August A, at the Boone
County Fair under the direction of
the Retail Merchants' Association
will be the subject for discussion at
the Commercial Club luncheon at 12
o'clock tomorrow- at Harris. Many
business men and fanners are inter
ested in this project, which is ex
pected to bring mule-colts from all
the counties in central Missouri.
Since the merchants have agreed
to arrange for this ring, the directors
of the Boone County Fair Association
have decided to publish its program
this year without any expense to Co
lumbia business men.
D. A. Robnett, chairman of the
committee in charge. Dr. W. P. Dy
sart and Tilford II. Murry will be the

3iAYOR SEMIS 3IILITIA A HA3r
Letter From City Engineer Draws an
Edible Answer.
Mayor J. M. Batterton received a l
letter from J. Paul Price, city engi
neer, who is now at Camp Clark, Ne-
vada, 3Io. 3Ir. Price says the mem
bers are all well and are enjoying
themselves so far as camp life goes.
3Ir. Price is second lieutenant of
the 3Iachine Gun Company, whicii was
organized in Columbia, and which will
leave Camp Clark for the 3lcxican
border soon. In his letter to the
mayor he says that the First regiment
is expected to leave camp todav-.

show his appreciation of the com

on the parkings and on vacant lots.
Prof. H. U, Kempster gave an ad
dress on the production and consump
tion of eggs. He urged that the mer
chants inspect the eggs that come
from the farmer. If they would de-
man,i g00n- quality they could afford
money.
Columbia Browns Will Play,
Mexico at Local Fair
grounds Tomorrow.
The Columbia Browns will attempt,
to get ecn with .Mexico for that af
fair laU Sunday when the two teams
meet at the fairgrounds here tomor
row afternoon. The boys think that
if they show something tomorrow it
may induce the moguls of the Central
Missouri League to reverse Umpire
Blackburn's ill-fated decision in the
ninth round of the last fray.
Manager Taylor will probably as
sign himself to do mound duty to
morrow. Last summer he was a mem
ber of the pitching staff of the St.
Joseph Club of the Western League,
and he went from there to the St.
Louis Browns, where he stayed till
school began last fall.
Mexico will bring Lancaster, a 19-year-old
left-hander. The first time
Columbia went to .Mexico this sea
son this young man fanned twenty
Brownies. Last Sunday, just before
the game, he grabbed the horsehide
and said he was going out for a rec
ord. He fanned seven and was touch
ed for eleven hits. Probably Lan
caster will attempt a come-back.
The contest will be an exhibition
game and has nothing to do with the
league pennant race. It will begin at
3:30 o'clock.

The Mexico baseball team will have

shoe before the ball lias touched the
ground.
Taj-lor sent in the protest as soon
after the game as possible. He ex
pects the answer U be here in a few
days. The rule book, Taj lor says, sup
ports his Wew that the batter is out
if the ball is caught in the hands of
the fielder before it touches the
ground. The umpire admits that the
ball was caught before it hit the
ground. All that George Taylor
needs now is a few favorable answers
from the sporting editors.
