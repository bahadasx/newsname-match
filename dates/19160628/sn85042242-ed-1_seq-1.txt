Incident Demonstrates Anew Inability of
De Facto Government to Afford
Frontier Protection
FEELING IN MEXICO IS
INTENSE AGAINST GRINGOES
El Paso, June 27.—Excitement along the border increased to­
night when news readied here of a new bandit forray with a
band at Hachito, N. M,, resulting in the murder of William Pack­
er, an American ranchman, and his wife.
American cavalrymen assisted by posses of ranchmen and resi­
dents of Hachito and nearby towns are pursuing the bandits who
today raided the rancli about 35 miles southwest, of Hachito, N.
M., killing William Parker, a ranchman, and his bride of live
months.
Because of the isolation of the district, no reports hail reached
Col. Sickel, commanding the border patrol here, at a late hour
tonight, but it was assumed that the raiders had crossed the
frontier, perhaps with the pursuers closely behind them.
Immediately the news of the raid became known, citizens ol:
Hachito and other towns in the neighborhood formed posses and
motored to the ranch to take up the trail of the bandits. Shortly
afterward, cavalry detachments were ordered out.
The general sentiment seemed to
be' that the incident demonstrating
anew the inability of the Carranza
government to offer any protection to
the American frontier would serve to
bring matters to a head, quickly.
•Military authorities here tonight
doubted that the marauders, who are
•Jjelieved to have been members of a
osind of Btock thieves known to have
a' lair in the fastnesses of the Slefra
Madres, south of the Mexican border,
would be overtaken before they cross­
ed! in
to.Mexico, poihting out that the
,1'Ancih Is but four miles from the line.
Ready For Hostilities.
-.(• Mexican reports tonight Indicated
thftt General Jacinto Trevino, com­
manding the Carranza army of the
north has practically, completed the
disposition of his troops in prepk*i\
tion for possible hostilities with the
United States. The strength of the
command is variously estimated at
from 25,000 to 40,000 men. For more
than a week, troops have been con­
centrated in force at strategic points
north of Chihuahua City, along the
line of the Mexican Central, running
directly south from Juarez.
Motor Trucks Gathered.
To offset the maneuvers, General
Pershing has gathered at Colonia
Dub tan more than 200 motor trucks,
with which in an emergency he cftn
transport infantry across country rap­
idly. The line of communication has
been shortened, the southern base be­
ing at El Valle, about 200 miles south
of the border. Mexicans traveling
over the motor truck trail occupied
by the Americans are subjected to the
'most rigid examination and the Amer­
ican fleet of aeroplanes recently sent
south from the base are making drilly
flights.
Hope Problem Will Be Solved.
The Mexican de facto government
still has hope, however, that the prob­
lem will be solved by the withdrawal
of the American troops from Mexico,
according to a telegram received to­
day at the local consulate at Mexico
City. It pointed out that a "very fa­
vorable impression" had been produc­
ed by General Trevino's report of the
withdrawal of the punitive forces
from Achinova and San Geronimo and
added the conclusion generally drawn
from General Trevino's report was
that the' Americans acted under or­
ders to return to the border for pa­
trol duty in their own territory.
"It is the opinion here," the dis­
patch continues, "that had proper vig­
ilance been used in the task and
warnings heeded, bandit raids could
have been minimized or otherwise
prevented.
Other dispatches to General Garsia,
at the capital, said that if the Ameri­
cans attempt to invade Mexico t'hey
will find facing them "45,000 full
blood Indians," that four centuries
ago resisted the march of Cortez.
Warship Fails to Salute.
"Indignation is felt over the report
from Mazatlan that an American war­
ship entered the harbor there and fail­
ed to give the customary salute.
It is hoped an explanation may be
tendered."
Rumored Report False.
Considerable excitement was caus­
ed today by rumors that American
troops had clashed with Carranzistas
In the Santa Maria River valley, east
of Colonia Dublan, and a number of
IMexican prisoners had been taken to
the American field headquarters.
However, the reports were denied by
both Mexican and American military
authorities here, and reports from the

DEPT TO
BUIEFOR (EM
Equipment Lacking Is. Hot Due
to Negligence of N. D.
Officials
Many queries have come from va­
rious sources during the past few
days as to the reason for the delay
In mobilizing the troops of the v.v
rious states and particularly the Na­
tional Guard of North Dakota.
It is generally known that the rea­
son for the delay has been due to the
fact that it has been impossible to
secure adequate equipment for the en­
listed men.
When asked last evening as to the
reason for this lack of equipment and
just who was responsible for the de­
lay in getting the men mobilized in
this state, due to the above mentioned
reason, Col. John H. Fraine stated
emphatically that the fault is not
with the national guard of the state
or any department of the militia offi­
cials. The commander also stated
that the blame can readily be attach­
ed to the war department of the Unit­
ed Sates.
"We are expected to have adequate
equipment for 65 men for each com­
pany," said Col. Fraine. "These or­
ders have been carried out to the
letter, but now that the call to arms
has been sounded by President 'Wil­
son, we find ourselves with more than
this number of men in practically
every company in our regiment and
no equipment forthcoming to care for
them.
"The equipment is issued by the ui
vision quartermaster and will un­
doubtedly come from the Rock Island
arsenal, located at /Rock Island, 111.
We are short tents, blankets, cloth­
ing, shoes and ponchos, the latter be­
ing the rubber blankets used by the
officers and men. Within the next
few days all extra equipment wiil be
on hand and the First Regiment'Na­
tional Guard of North Dakota will bo
ready for the call to the border."
Waukegon, 111-, June 27.—Wm. H.
Orpet, who elected to tell his own
story on the witness stand in refuta
tion of the charge of murdering Mar­
ion Lambert, completed a session of
cross examination today, which left
him pale and nervous.
Orpet will probably continue tomor­
row, and possibly the next day, and
there was little hope that the case
could go to the jury by the end of the
week. David R. Joslyn, state counsel,
dealt largely with Orpet's letters to­
day. The latter's friends expressed
much regret that much of his testi­
mony designed to get to one of the al­
leged motives for murder could not
be published. Mr. Joslyn lead him

COME TO BISMARCK'S BIG FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRAt
THIBTT-8IXTH YEAB, MO. 164 (NEWS OF THE WORLD) BISMARCK, NORTH DAKQTA, WEDNESDAY MORNING, JUNE 28, 1016. (BY ASSOCIATE!

EFi
Definite assurance that all of the
state troops who are stationed at Fort
Abraham Lincoln on July 4 will parti­
cipate in Bismarck's great Prepared­
ness Parade was received yesterday
from Col. J. H. Fraine, commanding
the First regiment infantry, North
Dakota national guard. .Nothing but
the possibility of interference with
the mustering in of the men—which is
an improbable contingency—can in­
terfere with the presence in line on
the morning of the Fourth of every
soldier who is quartered at the Bis­
marck concentration camp.
The question of transporting the
men from Fort Abraham Lincoln to
Bismarck—a distance of about seven
miles—is one which is now occupying
the attention of the Commercial club.
Colonel Fraine does not feel like ask­
ing his boys to hike that distance and
then to march the streets of Bismarck
for an hour, and it has been suggested
that the Northern Pacific could run a
string of cars—even "flats" would suf­
fice, as it will be in the nature of a
lark, anyway—out to the fort.
Local representatives of the North­
ern Pacific have been interviewed and
they are now at work on the problem,
which, it is trusted, may be solved
satisfactorily without too great diffi­
culty.

As the long day drew to a close, the
pale young witness looked at the clock
on the wall of the high ceiling of the
old fashioned courtroom. When the
hour arrived, he turned to Judge Don­
nelly:
"Are you through with your cross
examination," asked the Judge.
"There is a lot more, responded Mr.
Joslyn."
"We will adjourn," announced the
court.
Orpet tore himself from the chair,
strolled through those of the specta­
tors and fairly fell into one beside his
mother.

VERYjeVY VOTE
Interest in Results Intense Due
to Number of
.. ..
ALL FIGHTS ARE
MUCH IN DOUBT
All campaigns came to a close over
the state last night, bringing to
end one of the most remarkable politi­
cal battles in North Dakota.
Everyone is predicting a heavy vote.
'Never before in the history of the
state has there been so much effort on
the part of all factions to get out the
vote.
The strength ol" the Non-partisan
league and the cohesion of their vote
are two factors that the primary will
reveal. Seldom lias there been such
an air of apprehension. No one will
venture positive predictions.
Governor Harma and Senator Mc
Cumber wound up their contest last
evening. The chief executive motor­
ed to Wilton and made an address
there. He reports a successful meet­
ing. Hanna's friends last evening
were confident that he would be nomi­
nated.
Governor Hanna, upon the eve of
election, felt 'that his chances were
very bright.
Senator McOuinher spent the day in
Hanna's home town, Fargo, putting
the finishing touches to his campaign.
In that city he made the following
statement:
"I am confident that the people of
North Dakota will renominate me to­
morrow. I have been in every section
of the state and have received assur­
ance of support from every quarter
of the btate.
"The campaign has been one of un­
usual interest, and the people are thor­
oughly acquainted with the issues.
'I have every reason to feel confi­
dent of the outcome."
Discussing the Mexican situation,
Mr. McCumber stated that the devel
opments of the past few days must be
followed up by a determined move­
ment on the part of the United States
to rid itself of the Mexican problem by
making a clean sweep of the situation
and putting that country on its feet
Some of the candidates who have
l)een about the state are inclined to
think that R. A. Nestos will poll quite
a large vote. His strength, however,
is hard to estimate. In his section of
the state, however, Nestos is strongi
and in the past has been known as a
good vote getter.
Frazier's friends last evening were
claiming the state by a large plurality.
Some even went so far as to predict a
majority. Fraine and Burdick are also
confident, with George Smith assert­
ing his vote will run somewhere be­
tween 10,000 and 15,000-
It is impossible to get much of a
line on any of the other contests on
the state ticket.
The total vote two years ago on the
republican ticket for United States
senator was slightly over 58,000 votes:
for governor it ran more than 61,000.
Requisitions for ballots and the poll
lists indicate that many democrats
and socialists have registered this
year as republicans. So marked has
this been, that, in some precincts the

Large Crowd Witnesses Spectac­
ular Sight at Ft. Lincoln
Last Evening
COL. FRAINE REVIEWS
NORTH DAKOTA SOLDIERS
N, D. N. 6. Is Crack Regiment
—Other News From the
Camp
The people of North Dakota are
proud of the members of the National
Guard representing this slate. And
they have every reason to he. The
large crowd of Bismarck and out of
town people who visited the boys at
their camp at Fort Lincoln will bear
out this statement and it might also
be stated that those who were un­
able to visit the stale camp last even­
ing missed a sight that was well
worth traveling miles to see.
Practically every officer and enlist­
ed man participated in a dress pa­
rade on the parade grounds at the
fort, at (i o'clock last night, and it
was a magnificent sight. Headed by
the military band of 28 pieces, the
regiment, passed before their com­
mander, Col. .lohn H. Fraine, in
review, and the spectacle presented
thrilled the audience through and
through.
Proriiptly at 6 o'clock the men were
assembled into their various battal­
ions and matched onto the parade
•grounds, headed by their respective
liattaiion commanders. 'The military
band advanced, playing an appropri­
ate march, and were followed closely
by the field musicians, composed of
two buglers from each of the 12 com­
panies. The First battalion swung
along at a rapid march and came to
a halt. Battalions 2 and 3 came next,
and also came to a halt in perfect line
with the preceding battalion. When
all of the companies had gathered on
the parade ground, the band and field
musicians, the former organization
playing a spirited march, marched
past, the three battalions and to the
rear and then back to their places on
the right of the grounds. After per­
forming this ceremony, the band
"sounded off" and immediately after
the field musicians followed suit.
Old Glory is Lowered.
A thrill passed through the onlook­
ers as the band struck up the familiar
and inspiring air, "The Star Spangled
Fanner," and with the officers and
men at attention and the throng of
spectators in reverent silence, (fid
Glory, the sacred emblem of the Unit­
ed States of America, was lowered.
While speaking of this ceremony, it
may be interesting to the uneducated
in military matters to know that
the Stars and Stripes is lowered by a
special detailed body of soldiers and
is caught, by them, the flag never be­
ing permitted to touch the ground.
Col. Fraine Assumes Command.
During this portion of the drill Capt.
T. S. Henry of Valley City, adju­
tant to Col. Fraine, was in command
of the regiment. At this juncture he
formally turned over the command to
Col. Fraine, and the majors of the
three battalions and their adjutants
reported to the latter. After receiv­
ing orders, they returnd to the head
of their respective battalions.
Col. Fraine turned the regiment
over to Lieut. Col. Grafton, second in
command, and he took charge of the
troops while they marched from the
parade grounds. Col Fraine stood in
the center of the field while every
company marched by in reviw.
Crowd Pleased at Spectacle.
The hundreds of people who wit­
nessed the dress parade last evening
were highly pleased with the specta­
cle presented for their approval and
were loud in their prais of the officers
and men of the North Dakota Nation­
al Guard. It is likely that this cere­
mony will be performed every even­
ing, but no official orders to this ef­
fect have been issued to date. The
various companies were heartily ap­
plauded as they passed by on review
and every detail of the ceremony was
carried out to perfection.
The military mand is to be com­
mended for their work during fhe
above mentioned procedure and also
during the guard mount, which took
place at 5: SO. North Dakota has a
military band that is the equal of any
organization of its kind in the Unit­
ed States and the members are wor­
thy of much praise, both for their
ability along musical lines and also
for the able manner in which they
assisted in carrying out the program
as outlined above.
No New Developments.
Col. Fraine and Capt. Henry re­
ported last evening that to date there
are no new developments in the criti-

New Chairman of National Com­
mittee Is Close Friend
of Nominee
New York, June 27.—Developments
at the temporary headquarters of
Cliarls E. HugheB ranged today from
ratification by the national sub-com­
mittee on organization of the nomi­
nee's choice of William R. Willcox,
chairman of the Republican National
committee, to the announcement that
Theodore Roosvelt had accepted an
invitation to dine with Mr. Hughes to­
morrow night.
Mr. Willcox, lawyer, former post­
master at New York, and until 1!H3,
chairman of the Public Service com­
mission of New York, is a personal
and political friend of the nominee.
His selection results from Mr.
Hughes' desire to have as chairman
a resident of New York, known to him
personally, a man somewhat removed
from recent political developments,
not allied with any faction of the par­
ty, and acceptable to Republicans
and Progressives alike. The organi­
zation's sub-committee, which ratified
the nominee's choice, met at Mr.
Hughes' headquarters. Mr. Hughes
was present. Earlier in the day, the
sub-committee held an informal meet­
ing. Rports were current that the
selection of Mr. Willcox had met with
some opposition at the informal meetr
ing after the formal meeting. How­
ever, it was announced that all mem­
bers of th sub-committee had voted
for Mr. Willcox on the first ballot.
Chairman Willcox announced that
he soon would open headquarters in
New York, and would devote his en­
tire time to the campaign. The offi­
cers of the national committee and
the excutive committee will be ap
poined by the sub-committee, which
also will name the two vice chairmen
for the Chicago and Pacific coast of­
fices.
Col. 'Roosevelt's acceptance of Mr.
Hughes' dinner invitation followed an
exchange of personal notes. Col.
•Roosevelt also talked over the tele­
phone from Oyster Bay with Mr.
Hughes.
The dinner will be served in Mr.
Hughes' suite and there will be cov­
ers for only two.
Whether Col. Roosevelt would make
a tour in behalf of Mr. Hughes was
discussed at the headquarters today,
as well as the probability that former
Frsident Taft would be asked to make
a numberof speeches for the ticket

It has been very plainly indicatv
that unconditional surrender of the

General Carranza could take to avpid
hostilities.
The state department late today re­
ceived its first official news of Ike
cavalrymen prisoners from others
than Mexicans. The British consul
at Chihuahua City transmitted re­
port through the embassy, saying that
the 23 troopers and an interpreter
were being well treated, and that the
injuries of the two wounded men were
slight.
Whil the ambassador-designate con­

possibilities he sees in the present
