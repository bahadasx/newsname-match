Prompt Compliance by Congress 'Ex
pected. '
Prompt compliance by congress with
any request the president may make
as to Mexico was foreshadowed today
; by the calm which prevailed in both
houses. Although measures designed
to prepare for war were under consid
eration and the corridors "of the cap
Itol hummed with rumors, there' was
ro exciipment and discussion .of the
sublect on the floor was avoided. The
iPSiel.ilive branch of the. government
was -plainly awaiting to do its part
when what the majority regard as In
evitable should' come.
Protest Frorri Carranza Agent.
' Fllseo Arredondo, Mexican - ambassador-designate,
said he had received
no intimation of the course his gov- j
ernment intended to pursue and had
' rot even . been advised 6f the receipt
,of the American note. On his own
: responsibility, however, he sent -to the
I state department two communications,
i One complains against the enforce
. nient of a general embargo on ship-
ments to Mexico: the other recites
I that Mexican citizens have been - ar
I rested without cause in California and
i Arizona.
They warn Secretary Lansing that
! the present situation between the two
governments cannot fall to be gravely
aggravated by these matters, although
setting forth that the ambassador as
sumes .that local authorities, not the
state department, were responsible for
the trout-le.
So far as Is known, the state depart
ment has iot been advised of the de
tention of Mexicans. It Is an open
secret, however, that a practical em
bargo on commerce between the Unit
ed States and Mexico is being enforced
errectiveiy by customs and army offl-
cere, without the authority of a form
al proclamation.
Chilly Reception of Arbitration,
j Efforts to sound administration of
j llclals anew today as to their attitude
: toward some form of arbitration met
! with a chilling reception. Charles A.
Douglas, recently re-employed as
' General Carranza's legal advisor here,
. called on Counsellor Polk at the state
1 department He and Dr. Victor A.
: Penrton, head of the Yucatan Slsa
commission, had received word from
Louts Cabrera, the Mexican - finance
i minister that General Carranza was
; disposed to appeal to the arbitration
: provisions of the treaty of 1848, pro
vided the United States was willing to
submit the dispute to peaceful nego
tlations. Mr. Douglas Is understood to
have suggested that the arbitration
: provided under Section 21 of the
I treaty could well be employed to
: formulate a definite question as be
I tween the two governments which In
j turn might be settled by mediation. He
i lert tne conrerence wun xne ciear im
rression that the -Washington govern-
i ment would listen to no mediation
: suggestions.
Surrender of Prisoner Unconditional
, It has been very plainly indicated
, that unconditional surrender of the
I American prisoners held at Chihuahua
! would be the only immediate step Car
ranza could take to avoid hostilities
Whether a mediation proposal might
be considered after their release Is
matter of speculation. Officials have
.no desire even to talk matters over on
a hypothetical basis, founded o what
i might be possible If the prisoners were
given up. No person Interested In
. maintaining peace between the gov
; ernments has been able to obtain any
statements as to what might be ac
i complished toward mediation .of ' the
sltnatlon along the border.
' . There is reason to believe, however,
! that a plan which did not Involve a
! military status quo In Mexico and the
; consequent -hampering of General
f Ptmston's dispositions to guard the
: International line from raiders would
be considered at least if the captured
' troopers were freed first.

CRISIS OVER THE IRISH
, HOME RULE COMPROMISE
Rumored That Members of British i
Cabinet Have Resigned.
London, June Z7, 11.15 p. m.
Throughout today the air was charg
ed with rumors of a serious crisis over
the Irish home rule compromise. The
fact that there were two prolonged
cabinet councils, in addition to party
meetings, seemed to confirm this view.
An evening newspaper annoucjed that
the Marquis of Lansdowne, minister
without portfolio, and Walter Hume
Long, president of the local govern
ment board, had actually resigned,
but that their resignation had . not
been accepted. - Rumor also connect
1 the name of Lord Robert Cecil,
minister of war trade. with the minis
ters likely to resign.
The Earl of Selborne in the house
of lords explained that nothing- was
expected to be announced edefinitely
concerning the situation until after a
meeting of unioists tomorrow, at
which it was ' still hoped that the in
fluence of Andrew Bonar Law, secre
tary of state for colonies, who sup
ports Premier Asquith, and David
Lloyd George, the munitions minister.
wro framed the . Irish compromise,
might possibly avert a rupture. To
night, however, it was announced that
the unionist meeting had been post
poned until next week at the desire of
Mr. Boar Law and the government,
who wished further time for consider
ation for the Irish proposal. This post
ponement put a new complexion on
affairs and permits of the .hope that
the crisis will be avoided.

tion.
When it was apparent in the confer.
ence that an impasse had been reached
senator Chamberlain urged that bott
the relief appropriation inserted bj
the house and the senate substituti
providing for exemption from servic
of enlisted men with dependents b
eliminated. Representative Hay, chair
man or the house conferees, would nol
agree to the proposal, but it was re
ported tonight that administration
leaders would make another effort foi
agreement along those lines with at
understanding that relief be taken ui
later as a separate measure. 'A bi
already has been introduced by Sena

propriate 2,000,000 for relief of de

ization of the naval militia, including
federal pay on the scale of navy reg
ulars during active service and re
tainer pay not exceeding $120 a yeaj
for enlisted men and up to $500 foi
officers in time of peace.

Secretary Daniels wrote the naval
committee that the Padgett bill woull
greatly increase efficiency of the na
val militia as a reserve force. An
naval reserve force, he wrote, "wouli
be of little use to the naval service un
less it could be placed aboard navaj
vessels and sent to any destination
