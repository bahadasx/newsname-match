Otherwise Wilson Will Ask Congress for Per
mission to Take Them Back by Force
I
.
Washington, "June 28. Special
Agent Rodgers at Mexico City, in a
two-sentence telegram, dated yester
day, said he expected to receive Car
ranza's reply to the American note
today. Mr. Rodgers telegram was
received at the state department this
morning. The message was the first
word received from Rodgers , since
he reported delivering the American
note. He said it was believed the
Mexican authorities were investigat
ing the Carrizal affair. The message
gave no indication of the nature of
Carranza's reply v '
ONLY HONORABLE THING TO DO
Washington, June 28. Unless Gen
eral Carranza surrenders the twenty
three American troopers held at Chi
huahua City by tonight, President
Wilson will probably go before Con
gress tomorrow to ask for authority
to rescue them by force. Pending
their release, the United States gov
ernment will not consider any offer of
mediation or arbitration.
NO CHANGE IN WILSON'S AT
TITUDE Washington, June 28. There are
no indications that the administra
tion's position has changed. Officials
expect President Wilson to go before
Congress tomorrow if the reply of
Carranza to the American note is un
satisfactory. He will accept nothing
short of the immediate release of- the
American troopers captured at Car
rizal. There will be no negotiations.
The fact, that the men captured are
being held is viewed as a hostile act
requiring immediate repudiation thru
their release.
Special Agent Rodgers' statement
that an investigation of the Carrizal
clash is on is interpreted here as in
dicating a reply of renewed assertions
that the Americans were responsible
rather than that a change of attitude
bo expected.
Ambassador Designate Arredondo
has had no word from Carranza about
the status of negotiations. He has in
formed Carranza of the United States'
determination that the troops taken
prisoner at Carrizal must be released.
CAPTAIN COLLIER REMAINS
WITH HIS COMPANY
In war as in all other stern duties,
a man resolved to play his part, can
always find ways to do so, even as the
man who doesn't can generally find
excuses.
Captain W. A. Collier, of the War
rior Guards of Tuscaloosa, one of
the historical companies of Alabama,
and senior captain of . his regiment,
having almost broken himself down
with work incidental to getting his
company ready to go to the front,
was ordered by his physician to re
sign. He appealed to the adjutant
general, and by him was given per
mission to go to the state camp at
Montgomery, where "his health would
be cared for by his regiment."
Accompanied by a large number of
men, who would not go to the front
without him, he left Tuesday morning
for the camp at Montgomery intend
ing to recuperate if possible and at-
iciiu ia as many oi nis auues as pos
sible at the same time.
Captain Collier, tho suffering with
fever, had worked night and day for
bver a week, trying to get over a hun
tired raw recruits into shape, and
could neither eat nor take medicine.
Rest was imperatively demanded, and
the spirit that impelled him to take
t in camp rather than in his own
omfortable home is the same that
hiade southern armies so near invin-
ible fifty years ago.
Captain Collier is well known to
tany of our people". His two little
oys, William and James, are now in
,)cala, visiting their grandmother,
Irs. E. Van Hood.

GUARDS WONT
HAVE ANY GUNS
Organization, However, Will Probably
be Made at the Armory
this Evening
There are many persons in this
town who are hankering for a view of
the home guard at drill. These per
sons have the idea-' that the sight
would be similar to that of the policeJ
squads of a Charlie Chaplin picture.
The guard meets tonight in the arm
ory for the purpose, of organization.
But only for organization. There will
be ho drilling. No arms will be taken
to the armory, else there might be a
movie for certain. All these curious
folks might then have an opportunity
of seeing "Deck" Davis, George Mac-
Kay, Tom Sexton, Charlie Peyser,
Ben Condon, B. Goldman, et al, flying
down Fort King avenue, hotly pur
sued by the sheriff and deputies; with
possibly much tripping over the
brick paving and falling disgracefully
into sewer manholes.
It won't happen, however. Captain
elect; John M. Graham said this morn
ing that it would not be possible for
the guardsmen to bring out their
guns. Special permission would have
to be obtained from the courts. The
meeting will merely be to discuss the
situation and make plans to handle
any emergency that miht arise.

WORK HELD DACK
Sems to be Some Foundation for the
Report that the Site May Yet
.be Changed
The Star learns that-orders have
been issued by the railroads to hold
back the work on the union station,
and the report is substantiated by the
fact work has actually proceeded very
slowly during the last few days,, with
plenty of material on the ground.
This is taken to mean that the rail
roads are still considering means for
moving the station to a better site.
It is thought that the railroads
might be considering exchanging the
present site and the station as it
stands for the Masters site, the sta
tion now building to be converted into
a warehouse. Mr. B. A. Weathers,
vice president of the H. ,B. Masters
company, has no information as to
whether the railroads are still work
ing with a view to changing the sta
tion. - V-V

Mr. H. A. Fausett is now the local

lime to Ocala people for use on their
lawns before the carload of bags was
unloaded. - He thinks so well of the
soft phosphate as a fertilizer that he
will use it on his orange grove at
Lake Weir and on the next crops
planted. ; Mr. Fausett will make the
company a good agent and has fine
warehouse facilities for handling the
product. The Florida Soft Phosphate
& Lime company felt the need of a
local representative to handle Phos
lime and supply the retail demand for
it in quantities too small for ship
ment to advantage from the plant.

SCHOONERS ARE

Believed to be Loading in Florida
'Ports With Arms for

. (Associated Press)
Washington, June 28. The depart-,

watch on southern ports to prevent
the loading of arms for Mexico. Sev
eral schooners in Florida ports are
suspected.
POSTPONED
t-onvemion mai was to nave Ueen
1 j At .a -mtr . WW
Held in Ocala July 12, to Discuss
the PrnnosH RnnH Tssno
for Roads'
In order that there might be a
thoroughly understanding throughout
the county with regard to the propos
ed bond issue for permanent roads,
and as to the handling of the same, a
letter will be sent out asking that the
meeting in the various precincts be
postponed until as much information
as possible is furnished. This will
mean, also a postpontment of the
convention that was to have been held
in Ocala on July 12.
When the . members of the county
democratic executive committee were
asked last Saturday to call meetings
in their precincts for the purpose of
ascertaining the sentiment of each
precinct, and to select three or more
delegates to the convention here, the
committeemen were not thoroughly
informed as to the details of the pro
posed bond issue; and it has since
been thought that possibly the news
paper reports had not reached every
one. It 13 for the purpose of getting
this information to the committee
men, and hence to the people, that a
postponement has been . decided on.
The intention is to have every one un
derstand how the bond money is to
be spent, where it is to be spent, and
by whom.
It i3 believed that many who have
heretofore opposed a bond issue for
good roads in this county will favor
an issue on the basis proposed, which
is that made use. of in Polk county.
In that county the specifications were
prepared by competent enginers, bid3
were asked for, and the contracts for
the construction of the roads were
awarded subject to the vote of the
people. , Every voter in Polk county
know whether or not he would be
benefited by the bond issue, whether
his section of the countv would trt. n
road or not, and special pains were
taken to see that every part of the
c ounty was provided for. It was a
clean cut proposition.
As soon as possible the information
will be gotten out, and new dates set
foi the meetings.
