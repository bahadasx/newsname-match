Washington.-The official text of
the note to the Mexican de facto gov
ernment, transmitted to James Lynn
Rodgers, special representative of the
American government in Mexico City
follows:
"Mr. Arredondo delivered to this
government the following communica
tion: ?
"'I am directed by my government
to inform Your Excellency, with -ref
erence to the Carrizal incident, that
the Chief Executive, through the
Mexican war department, gave orders t
to Gen. Jacinto B. Trevino, not to
permit American forces from Gen
eral Pershing's column to advance
further South, nor to move either
East or West from the points where
they are located, and to oppose new
incursions of American soldiers into
Mexican territory. These orders were
brought by General Trevino to the
attention of General P= ging, who
acknowledged the recei- f the com
munication relative thc '. On the
22nd instant, as your eiflency knows er
an American force moved eastward
quite far from its base, notwithstand
ing the above orders and was engag
ed by Mexican troops at Carrizal, e
State of Chihuahua. As a result of
the encounter several men on both
sides were killed and wounded and 17
American soldiers were made prison
ers.
"You are hereby instructed to hand r
to the Minister of Foreign Relations
of the de facto government the fol
lowing:
"'The government of the United G
States can put no v her constuc .ca
upon the communication handed to
the secretary of state of the United
States on the 24th of June by Mr. Ar- a
redondo, under instruction of your
government, than that it is intended
an a formal avowal of deliberatey
hostlle action against the forces of
the United States now in Mexico and
of the purpose to attack them without
provocation whenever they move from a
their present position in pursuance of ti
the objects for which they were sent
there, notwithstanding the fact that 1
those objects not only involve no un- e
friendly intention towards the gov
ernment and people of Mexico, but
are on the contrary, intended only to a
assist that government in protecting i
itself and the territory and the peo
ple of the United States against irre
sponsible and insurgent bands of rebel
marauders.
"'I am instructed, therefore, by my
government to demand the immediate '
release of the prisoners taken in the
encounter at Carrizal, together with
any property of the United States
taken with them and to inform youe
that the government of the Unitedn
States expects an early stat ent from
your government as to te course of
action It wishes the government of
the United States to understand it has 0t
determined upon and that it also ex-a
pects that this statement be made
through the usual diplomatic channelsF
and not through subrodinate militaryL
commanders." a

Congress has contemplated to add tc
$20.000,000 to army appropriation bill

$6,000.000 is in the course of prepara- fe
tion. Congress is working hard to dis- rs
pose of the ro'utinc legislative pro- ci

[OTE IS RECEIVED FROM

Result of Soldiers Moving Other

Ordered by Carranza and Communi
cated to General Pershing.
38,000 MILITIAMEN IN t

New York.-More than 38,000
of the 128,000 National Guards
men of the Department of the
East, comprising 22 states cast
of the MPb.issippi and District
of Columbia, were in mobiliza

s
Washington.-A demand for the im
ediate release of the American troop
s taken prisoner at Carrizal coupled
ith a stern notification that the Unit
I States expects an early statement
the purposes of the Carranza Gov
-nment was telegraphed to Mexico
ty by Secretary Lansing.
The note discloses that the State
epartment received a communicatlon
om the de facto Government stating
at the Carrizal fight was the direct
>sult of orders to attack American
ldiers moving otherwise than to
ards the border personally issued by
eneral Carranza to General- Trevino
id by the latter communicated to
eneral Pershing.
In reply Secretary Lansing requires
t the de facto Government transmit
definite statement "as to the course
action it has determined upon,"
rough the usual diplomatic channels,
ad not through subordinate military
icers'."
The Mexican communication is con
rued, Secretary Lansing states, "as
formal avowal of deliberately hos
le action against the forces of the!
nited States now' in Mexico and of
te purpose to attack without prove
tion whenever they move from their
resent position despite the frieddly
ission on which they are engaged
ad which is re-affirmed in the Amer
an rejoinder.
White House Conference.
General Carranza is required to1
Lace himself on record formally and
1e plain intimation lies behind the
,strained language of Mr. Lans-ing's
>mmunication that force will be Iget
ith force. Apparently, however, the
ashington Government is determin
that the de facto Government shall
t evade responsibeility before the
orld if war is forced upon the United
tates
The note and the military situation
the United States were talked over
the White House by the President
Ith Chairman Stone, of the Senate
oreign Relations Committee. Senator
odge ranking Republican member,
id Chairman Flood of the House
ommittee on Foreign Affairs. Rep
~sentative Cooper, ranking minority
ember of the House Coinmittee, was
it of e cty.
After the conference which lasted
ore- than an hour. Senator Stone
dd the situation was "exceedingly
,ute." The President had felt it
cessary to acquaint Congress with
:e state of affairs and the action
,ken, through the Foreign Affairs
ymmittee. It was indlicated that he
ight desire to address a joint ses
on of the H-ouse and Senate in a
ty or two, but would not take this
aal step until the. Mexican Govern
.ent had been given an opportunity
>reply.
Warlike Says Stone.
The President told those at the con
rence of the note from General Cat
nza avowing the attack on Amer:
n troops at Carrizal, and of the re
ly that he had directed to be sent
nator Stone was very emphatic
Eterwards in regard to the demand
yr release of the prisoners.
"We must have those men." he said
ylemnly.1
The Senator made no effort to hide
s own belief that war virtually is
ere. A final report from Generai
ershing was Aeceessary, he said. in
-der that a clear knowledge or whia
ad happened at Carrizal should be at
"But if they are going to atta-k our
en without cause,'' he said. "there is
1y one thing to do. We will never1
ave peace down there until we use
>rce enough to compel it."
There is reason to believe that the
litary situation may be influencing
te Administration's diplomatic course.

It seems doubtful that a formal dip
omatic rupture will be forced before

;ible, particularly as it has been indi- 2
:ated that quick, drastic action, is t
?resident Wilson'p desire should Gen- t
,ral Carranza force the use of the c
trmy against him. n
Mr. Wilson's visitors sought light d
n these questions. Specific figures t
were not available as to the garrisons it
;t various border towns, the number t,
f guardsmen who have responded to s
:he President's call, or the time that b
,ould be required to get the entire n
orce to the border. These details c
ave been left to the War Department o
nd Secretary Baker was not present
.t the conference. The general situ- a
tion was presented. however, and C
here is reason to suppose that the For
ign Affairs Committeemen opprovei
:he President's course.
No Talk of Mediation.
One fact as to the conference is
significant. There was no discussion
)f the possibility of mediation. The E
subject was not mentioned either by
ho President or his callers. Senator
atone said.
This statement came in the face of
t formal notification to Eliseo Arre- S
ondo, Mexican ambassador designate, a
)y his government, that it approved t
he principle ef mediation as pro
osed by seceral Latin-American t
:ountries. Mr. Arrendondo expected
yarly authorization to begin conversa
ions with his Latin-Ameri-can col
eagues here, in an effort to divert a
:he crisis to p'eaceful channels.
There was no indication that any t
1-plomat had attempted to sound Sec
-etary Lansing in this respect. e
It is known, however, that he s
iolds that the United States has noth- 1
ng to mediate since its only object 2
s the protection of its own borders. b
e has formally notified all Latin. b
Ierican diplomats that the Washing- r
on government has no aggresive pur. t
yose toward Mexico. but is resolved t
:o free its citizens along the border o
f the danger of bandit raids. s

Col. Edgeworth Montague Blythe
commander of the First South Carc
ina infantry and ranking officer it
the state, came early to camp Styx it
order to superintend the workof preI
aration for the reception of the Firs
and the Second regiments.
"I anticipate no trouble in recruit
ing our regiments up to war strength,
said Col. Blythe. "There will be re
cruiting officers in each station afte
the troops leave and these, with the
assistance of medical examiners, wil
take care of all those who desire ti
enlist after the regiments are encamp
ed at Styx. Before being mustered
into service of the United States th:
men will stand a second physical ex
amination by medical officers of the
regular army.
i The tendency has been to localizi
the enlistment of troops. It should
be clearly understood that any person
in the state can enlist in any com
pany.
"I am glad to see the liberality with

Want Funds to Erect Hall.
An appeal to the patriotism 1
South Carolinians was issued by W
W. Moore, adjutant general, for fund
with which to erect a commodiou:
hall on the encampment grounds a
Styx for the comfort and welfare o
the enlisted men and officers. It i:
estimated that the assembly hall
which would be a permanent adjunc
of the camp, would cost $750. Con
tributns to the fund will be received
in the office of the adjutant general.
'There is not a sufficient amount a

Peepes Defines Status of Guard.
An opinion was given by Thomas
H. Peeples, attorney general, advising
that the authority over the National
Guard of South Carolina was trans
ferred to the president of the United
States, immediately upon their cal:
into service, according to the new mil
itary statute of the United States
passed Jun~e 3, 1916. Arguments offer
ed to substantiate federalization o1
the guard were that they were entitled
to the same pay, rations and allow
ances; that all vacancies are filled by
orders of the president; and all dis
missals confirmed by his action. "The
president is virtually given the entire
ontrol of the National Guard when
called into the service of the national
government."

URN OUT MILLIONS OF PIPES
lanufacturers in the United States
Supply a Very Large Part of
the World's Demand.
Over 20,000,000 pipes are manufac
ured annually in the United States.
'he wooden pipe is probably more
istinctly national than any which
Inds its way into the market. Rang
ig in between the aristocratic meer
chaum and the plebeian clay, it is
arely expensive, while at the same
ime its manufacture calls into exist
nce a considerable industry. The
oots of the mountain laurel and rho
odendron are most generally used for
pipe making, they being selected for
he purpose on account of their du
ability, hardness and the light polish
rhich they are capable of taking. They
re found throughout the southern
tates generally-the best material is
aid to come from North Carolina and
s sent to the market in large pieces,
which vary in size from that of a
an's fist to the dimensions of a good
ized keg. The material costs from
40 to $60 per ton, the price depend
g upon the quality of the wood. In ad
ition to the domestic material used
a pipe making, immense quantities of
rier root blocks are shipped into this
ountry annually from southern

Certain Path.
Those who think a habit is just
omething you remember-that Is, is
urely a mental proposition, are mis
aken. Habit is a question of mechan
es as much as the smooth drawing
f a piston rod.
Habit is the action of nerve mo
ions along a beaten path. A muscle
omewhere in the body contracts and
nerve moves because it cannot help
t, and so on until the process is
omplete, and-the thing we call habit
s done.
There are as many of these paths
a the nervous system as there are
habits. The impression which one
terve center receives awakens another

raveled over.
The first time the action is per

his reason some things are hard to

Lightning in Rural Districts.
Nine-tenths of the annual mortality

"Uncle Sam."
The application of the term "Uncle
lam" to the United States had its be
inning in Trcy, N. Y., during the war
f 1812. A commission contractor of
'roy, named Elbert Anderson, had-a
hop in which the siccks were always
xamined and passed by a government
aspector called Samuel Wilson, who
as generally known as "Uncle Sam."
Vhen the boxes were passed they1
rere always marked with the initials
f the contractor and the nation, "EA
ES." One day the man who was doing:
lie marking was a~sked what the ini-1
ials stood for, and replied, jokingly,
iat they were the initials of the con
ractor and of "Uncle Sam." The joke

nd long before the end of the war

TOM AND DICK
By ISABEL LEE.
Tom's wife sat before her dressing
able putting the fnishing touches to
ier afternoon toilet.
"ittle do you know how worried I
um," Tom's wife sighed- pathetically.
'But I won't bother you with my
troubles. You have so much to be
happy about and so many plans to
make for the wedding."
Dick's fiancee bit her pretty lips.
'Tm not at all sure there is going to
be any wedding," she said.
"I don't even know whether to go
Sown to shop or not," added. the
younger woman. "Whats the use of
getting the things when I don't know
whether I shall want the-the we4-l
ling veil and white satin and the
rest? But don't taL.. .. poor little:
me. Id so much r.her know wh
you -are worrying."
Tom's wife laughed softly. "First
it was the teacup," she said. "It was _:
the morning he asked me for a lem
an. The next evening he bad a mys
nerious little package when he came
Tome. It was a horrid, sticky, teacup.
"Well, the next night It happened
again-such a horrid old cup. That
kept on for several days. I asked hbn.
utrigh t what it was all about.
"'Wll, you have caught me, snook- :
ems, haven't you?' Those were the ,
very words he used, and then Om
laughed a little, rather sheepishly,
and tried to kiss me:' 'I didn't. want
to tell you at first,' he said. 'I thought
you'd make a fuss about It. But that
new English secretary-'
"That new English secretary-and.
that was the first time that I had
even heard of the creature-he said -'
had to have tea. They all do in Lon
ion, he said.
"'You've never had tea with me,' I
said, 'and now for this-brazen English
secretary. But why make a fool of
yourself by bringing the cups home-'"
"'Thats where the joke comes In,'
he said laughing 'I thought of get
ting Miss Stebbins to wash them, but
she rebelled.'
"'Just because I am a woman, I
suppose you think I must do the
drudgery. I never washed a dish in
my life. If you want a servant you -
should have hired one, and not- a
stenographer,' said Miss Stebbins.
"'I am sure I don't at all blamer
Miss Stebbins,' I said."
"You did perfectly right," .said
Dick's fiancee. "I know all about-It.

but two cups home at night-his and
the secr.etary's. He even brought :
them around to wash, and then be
told me, just as Tom did you, about
the creature. Only he wouldn't say.
much and I- said less. - I didn't want
him to tell you that I was jealous and
it is not -really that. Only, of course,
if that Is the kind of man Dicks,f
he is the sort wlho stoops to office flir
ations."
"Have you seen her?" iniuired
Tom's wife, patting away an Imagfin
ary tear through the meshes of her
veil.
"Heavens, no, and I don't 'want to.
Of course, she is a tall, 'willowy,
blonde. English women so ok~en are"
The idea seemed teoccur to theml
both at once of stealing unexpectedly
nto the office where Tom and Dick
beld their tea orgies every afternoon.
Anud in less than half an hour the two
women had started downtown with allI
the intense excitement of a real ad
enture.
"It isn't as-if we were doing any
ting underhanded," assured Tom's
wife. "For I am sure any 'wife has a
Ight to call at her husband's office.
Do you suppose they sent way to
London for her? I don't see why
tey couldn't have sgot some honest,
leserving American girl 'who would
save been quite satisfactory."
They had reached the office and
['om's wife went in first. Tom and
ick were both in and showed no end
>f pleasure at the visit. They took
hem right into Tom's big, roomy of
ce.
"'Stick around for a half hour
nore," Tom said, "and you can have
:ea with us. Its a great institution,
sn't it, Dick?"
Both Tom's wife and Dick's fiancee
miled coldly. But It was part of
heir plot to stay. They peered around
~very curve and listened for every
ound, expecting to see the 'willowy
onde appear. But the only petti- -
oats they saw were worn by the -
ourfaced Miss Stebbins, who sat
ounding away relentlessly at her
ypwriter.
"Maybe 'we can get the ladies- tor
ash up the dishes," suggested Tom,
'It's such a nuisance to have to cart
hem home with us."
Toms wife had her ceue and, while
)ick's fiancee fairly trembled at what
;he felt was bound to follow, she be
"It seems to -ee that the English
ecretary had better do the dishwash
ng, since it was the English secre
ry's idea to have tea."
Tom and Dick began to .laugh.
That's a good one," said Tom, and
hen, at his sumons, a tall, fine-look
ng middle-aged, well-tailored man
ppeared.
"The wife says you. ought to wash
he dishes," Tom repeated with a
ugh, and then he introduced them

ompany, whom Tom and Dick wanted
vorably to impress and not- that
