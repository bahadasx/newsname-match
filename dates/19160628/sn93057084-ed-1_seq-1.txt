TO DEVELOP SO. DAKOTA COAL
Everybody in So. Dakota ought
to be taking a lively interest in the
question of obtaining a market
for the immense deposits of lignite
coal in the northwest corner of the
state, and that interest needs to be
directed towards the legislature
body which should be having a
hand in the development of the
State. The Immigration Bureau
and Highway Commission we now
have are only ornamental institu
tions, directed mainly toward as
sisting local land agents and spec
ulators. What we want to see is
some legislation to advance the in
dustrial development of the State.
This would create a home market,
without which the farmer only has
half a chance.
Our present Immigration and
Highwa3T departments, too, are at
present only "Ornaments" because
their hands are practically tied for
the lack of funds with which to ac
complish anything for the direct
benefit of the majority of our cit
izens.
The manufacture of briquettes
out of lignite coal is the purpose
of a new corporation which has se
cured its charter from the state.
They incorporate under the name
of the Johnson Fuel Company of

Fairfax, Gregory county, and
claim thai they will saye the peo
ple of the state thousands of dollars
by their operations. They are
capitalized at §2"w00,000, and the
incorporators are Charles A. John
son, John N. Ellerman, William
A. Leach, and a number of others.
The Sioux Falls Press of June
20 gives the following account of
the proposed enterprise of the
above named company:
"•Utilization of the vast lignite
fields of South and North Dakota
to the great advantage of the peo
ple of the two states presents itself
as a commercial possibility soon to
be realized in the light of state
ments made by a party of men who
arrived in the city yesterday and
who are interested in the matter of
briquetting the product nnd fur
nishing fuel at a price that will
make winter a luxury and solve
many of the manufacturing prob
lems that have troubled enterpris
ing business organizers of the
state.
"The party is composed of Chas.
A. Johnson of Fairfax, this state.
Emil Fernholz and Frank D. Mc
Clure of Los Angeles, Cal, and M.
A. Clark of Minneapolis. Yester
da3T afternoon they had a confer
ence with officers of the commer
cial club and arrangements were
made for them to meet the indus
trial committee of the commercial
club at a luncheon this noon.
'This state can be furnishd with
coal from its own mines for thou
sands of years at a price per ton
which would make a savins of
many millions of dollars a year,
besides leaving in the state the
money which it cost to produce
it,'said Mr. Johnson to a reporter
for The Press when he interview
ed the members of the party in
their apartments at the Carpenter
hotel last evening. Mr. Johnson
is well known over the state from
his connection with a line of banks
in the Rosebud country, his aggres
sive promotion of alfalfa, and his
general development work in that
section.
'Within the last week we have
looked over a portion of the big
fields of lisrnite in South and North
Dakota and find the deposit un
limited.'' said Mr. Johnson. "It
is not a question of acres, but of
miles of coal deposits. We exam
ined mines that are in operation
where the veins are from 14 to 20
feet in depth of solid coal. The
coal on 1000 acres of land that we
estimated showed upwards of 40,
000,000 of tons in that locality.
"Plans are being made for the
organization of the Johnson Fuel
company. We have secured a
body of coal that contains 12,000,
000 tons that will cost an average
of one cent per ton. unmined.
This year we expect to build a six
unit plant on some of our South
Dakota holdings which will put out
420 tons of briquetts per day, and
we now control enough lignite to
supply the state for 40 ears.
"There is a possibility of the
headquarters of this concern being
located in Sioux Falls. I am con
fident that it can be put through
with South Dakota capital—I know
it can for I'll put it through my
self if it is necessary. These coal
fields belong to Dakotans and thev
should have the benefit. There
will be no water in the stock there
will be no money paid for promot
ers, and there will be no commis
sion charges for any stock that I
sell and 1 may sell a good share of
what is sold.
"This is a matter in which 1 can
enter with all my heart," continu
ed the speaker, "for it is strictly
a Dakota affair and I am a Dako
tan. I'd rather be president of a
''The Injury oj one ts the
f-oncern
concern that could utilize raw ma
terial in South Dakota for the
benefit of its people than to be
president of the United States."
Emil Fernholz. president of the
Fernholz Machinery i- nnpanv of
Los Angeles. Cal.. manufacturers
of clay and briquetting machinery,
has accompanied Mr. .Johnson and
other members of the party in
their investigations of the fields
and the exclusive right of his lui
quettintr machincrv has been secur
ed by Mr. uhnson for North and
South Dakota.
Products of the lignite beds of
this state have been shipt to the
Los Angeles plant for briquettinir
and will be on exhibition in the
city soon. In ^poakinir of the
manlier of putting the. lignite, in
shape for commercial use, Mr.
Fernholz said:
The averagev.oal contains from
to 45 per cent water. In order
to briquet we take out the water
and apply a pressure of 100,000 lbs
per square inch. It takes about 15
per cent of the ordinary coal to
iurn out the water and in a ton of
ordinary coal then one gels but
about o0 per cent of efficiency.
"In briquetting lignite the coal
as it comes from the mine is first
crushed in a coarse crusher and
then run into a pulverizer where it
is ground into line material. It is
then elevated and dumped on a
screen, the coarser parts automati
cally dropping back into the pul
verizer and the line coals fall into
a big steel bin of JO tons capacity.
From this bin it goes into a big
dryer wheel -.villi a surface of 2,040
square feet, and in the revolution
of this wheel, fed by exhaust from
the engine, a large amount of
moisture is taken out. From the
dryer wheel the coal leads into a
conveyer, thence into a big hopper
which automatically feeds into the
press and then J?tiito the cars.
"There is no stop in the process
of manufacture from the time the
coal is taken from the mine until
it is loaded in the car in the form
of the commercial briquet—a bri
quet containing no binder and ab
solutely no foreign material of any
kind, burning with a blue flame and
producing no smoke, odor or soot.
In short, the briquetting of coal
does in a fraction of a second what
it takes nature hundreds of thou
sands of years to do.
"Each briquet weighs one pound.
One press will make from 100 to
120 per minute, or 72 tons per 24
hours, and the product, will with
stand the action of water and
atmosphere and is equal to the
best bituminous coal."
