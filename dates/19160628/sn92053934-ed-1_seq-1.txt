WILSON FIRM
IN STAND ON
MEXICO CASE
Nothing Short of Immediate
Release of Americans
Will Be Accepted.
EXPECT REPLY TODAY
Special Agent Rodgers Be
lieves Carranaa Answer
Is Forthcoming.
Washington, Jnne 2S Special
Agent Rodgers at Mexico City in a
brief telegram dated yesterday and
received at the state department
early today, said he expected to be
handed today Carranza's reply to
the American note demanding the
release of soldiers taken prisoner
at Carrizal.
The message, containing but two
sentences, was the first word the de
partment had heard from Mr. Rodgers
since he reported the delivery of the
note. It said it was believed the Mex
ican authorities were investigating the
Carrizal affair but gave no indication
of what would be the reply to the
American demands.
Secretary Lansing announced late
today that nothing further had been
heard from Special Agent Rodgers at
Mexico City and that the state depart
ment had no intimation of when the
reply of Carranza would be sent nor
what would be its nature.
Thcye was nothing to indicate today
that the Washington government's pos
ition had undergone any change. Of
ficials still expected President Wilson
to go to congress tomorrow if Car
ranza failed to act or replied unfav
orably. Anything short of immediate
release of the American troopers will
be unsatisfactory. No suggestions or
proposal of negotiations in this re
gard will be accepted.
Indications Disappointing.
Mr. Rodgers' statement that Car
ranza officials appeared to be conduct
ing an inquiry into the Carrizal clash
was interpreted here as indicating that
the reply would support previous as
sertions that American troops were re
sponsible than that a change of atti
tude was to be expected.
Eliseo Arrendondo, the Carranza
ambassador designate, still had receive
ed no word early today from his chief.
Carranza's delay is believed here to
be due largely to his hope to have
South and Central American countries
agree fully to his course before he
takes a final step.
wijson Sees Congressmen.
President Wilson today received a
long line of senators and representa
tives. Senator Lewis of Illinois was
one of the callers who discussed the
Mexican problem.
"The president expressed the wish
to me," Senator Lewis said, "that what
ever discussion there might be in con
gress on the Mexican situation should
be conducted entirely in a non-partisan
manner."
John R. Silliman, consul at Saltillo,
who now is at Eagle Pass, Texas, ad
vised the state department of the re
ceipt by Dr. Atl, editor of a Mexico
City labor paper, of a telegram from
General Carranza saying he was pre
pared to do everything possible to
avoid a break with the United States.
Tillistas Concentrating.
El Paso, Tex., June 28 Fresh
cause for apprehension was found
along the border today in news of the
gathering of 6trong forces of former
Villistas under notorious chieftains in
the vicinity of Juarez.
fSeneral Jose Flores commanding
800 infantrymen is reported in Juarez
after making peace with the de facto
government. General Manuel Banda,
once a Villa subordinate, known to be
across the Rio Grande, and Manuel
Medinavietia and Jose Ysabel Robles,
also have taken advantage of the am
nesty granted by Carranza. Colonel
Maximo Calstillo, former Villa leader,
has joined General Gonzales' garrison
in Juarez.
Former Villa adherents, who are
now refugees in El Paso, are under
close surveillance by civil and mili
tary authorities.
Foodstuffs Released.
Although the embargo of munitions!
still is enforced rigidly at points of I
entry, several wagon loads of food-!
stuffs held up at the international'

signors having received permission
from Washington to send them across.

SOCIALIST BEING
TRIED IN BERLIN
Former Mmbf r of Reichstag on Trial
As Instigator of May Day Peace
Demonstration.
Berlin, June 28. The trial of Dr.
Karl Liebknecht, the socialist, leader,
begins today before a court martial
which will decide whether he was
guilty of attempted treason in time of
war in participating in a "May day
peace demonstration" in Berlin.
Dr. Liebknecht, whose criticisms of
the government in speeches in the
reichstag previously had led to his ex
pulsion from the socialist party in that
body, was arrested on May 1 during
the demonstration and since has been
held in custody. He has been accused
of arranging the demonstration at
which it is alleged cries of "down with
the war," and "down with the kaiser"
were raised by the excited demonstrat
ors. A report on his arrest asserted
that he resisted the police but finally
was knocked down and overpowered.
Parliamentary immunity for Dr.
Liebknecht was claimed but not al
lowed. It was announced he had denied
that he was guilty of treason but ad
mitted taking part in the demonstra
tion. It was at first understood that
he was to be brought before a court
martial he being a soldier as well as
a legislator on the charge of high
treason, conviction on which would
have carried with it the death penalty
but recently it was published that the
accusation had been modified to at
tempted treason in war time, the maxi
mum penalty for which is 15 years
penal servitude.
Four Berlin newspapers published
today the following from the semi
official Wolff bureau:
"In the course of a demonstration
last evening for Deputy Liebnecht, a
rather large crowd collected at I'ots
damcr Platz (Berlin). Some twenty
persons were taken into custody to es
tablish their identity. There were no
further incidents."

to do in caring for the parishes and it
is not much of a sacrifice for them to
give up all attendance on the theatre."
