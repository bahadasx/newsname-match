DENVER, ' June 27 Governor
George A. Carlson late today notified
M. P. Capp, warden of the state re
formatory at Buena Vista, that he
found him guilty of "neglect of duty,
malfeasance in office and incompe
tency," in the affairs of the- institution
and directed him to turn over the war
denship to R. L. Shaw.
Theactlon follows a hearing last
week before the governor which arose
out of Capp's refusal to comply with
demands several months ago that he
relinquish his position. The matter
was taken to the courts and Capp was
sustained in his contentions that the
charges upon which his removal was
sought were not sufficiently specific.
About two months ago Governor Carl
son had served upon Capp a complaint
setting forth the charges in detail.
In the governor's statement notify
ing Warden Capp of his dismissal, he
declares that Capp had permitted
twenty-four escapes from the Institu
tion in littls more than a year, cost
ing the state t'.t'JO; that he permitted
extreme and inhumane punishment of

In an hour, however, his composure !
was gone. He moved from side to
side in his .seat, twisted his fingers
nd scarcely iooked at iys inquisitor.
For the most part his head was in
clined to one side, and he gazed out
of the corner of his eyes in the gen
eral direction of the lawyer, but not
ut him.
At one time, one of the letters
which he wrote to Marion, was left to
his nervous fingers.
"Mr. Orpet." warned Attorney Jos
lyn. "Please don't twist that letter as
you II destroy it."
The e-ourt room was packed up to
the very edge of the judge's bench
and on either side of it mostly with
women. For the most part the tes
timony was of an extremely embar
rassing nature,' but it did not deter
the women from returning to the
afternoon session. luring the fore
noon, those close enough to hear hung
their heads most of the time but by
afternoon they-were used to it.
Orpet probably will continue under
cross-examination tomorrow and peis
sibly the next day and there was
little hope that the case would go to
the jury by the end of the week.
Mr. Joslyn dealt largely with Or
pet s letters today. The latter s
frii'nds express regret that much tif
his testimony, designed to disprove
one of j.he alleged motives for murder
uld not be published. Mr. Joslyn
led him through calm, waters, along
this line, emly to disclose whirlpools
and rapids in which Orpet's craft
tossed perilously but he clung' des
perately to his fundamental asser
tions. For a few fleeting moments Mr.
Joslyn turned from the letters to the
subject of cyanide of potassium the
n from which Marion died. This
was in connection with the purchase
of some brown "dope" as Oriet termed
it which he bought for Marion on
two occasions. This was one or the
places where he became confused and
under savage attack corrected himself.
He bought the "dope" at a drug
store at Madison. Wis., where he was
attending the University eif Wiscon
son. Mr. Joslyn in his most persuave
manner said that William Zink and
Charles Hassinger. friends of the de
fendant out of school, clerked in the
store and that Orpet and others made
it a rendezcouz.
Was there a soda fountain? Y'e.?
Cigars? Yes. Where were they?
Toilet accessories? Where were they?
Orpet was able to describe the con
tents and arrangement of the stock
with moderate confidence.

the tension that has held the border
since the Carrizal encounter.
William Parker and his wife. Alice,
belonging to a family well known along

were the victims of the raid. They
were killed in their ranch home south
west of Hachita, X. M., after a des
perate but unavailing fight by the
young husband.

WILSON TO CALL' '

PERHAPS TOI
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHIXGTOX, June 27. Unless
General Carranza surrenders the
twenty-three American troopers held
at Chihualuia City before tomorrow
night. President Wilson probably will
go before congress Thursday to ask
for authority to rescue them. Pending
their release, the United States gov
ernment will not consider any offer
of mediation or arbitration.
The state department had no inti
mation tonight as to when a reply to
the note sent Sunday demanding im
mediate release of the soldiers might
be expected. It was delivered yes
terday at 11 a. m. Special Agent
Rodgers has been unable to fosecast
the action of the de facto authorities.
Prompt compliance by congress with
any request the president may make
as to Mexico was foreshadowed today
by the calm which prevailed in both
houses. Although measures designed
to prepare for war were under con
sideration and the corridors of the
capitol hummed with rumors there
was no excitement and discussion of
the subject on the floor was avoided.
The legislative branch of the govern
ment was plainly waiting to do it 3
part when what the majority regard
ed as inevitable should come.
Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassador-designate,
said he had received
no intimation of the course his gov
ernment intended to pursue and had
not even been advised of the receipt
of the American note. On his own
responsibility, however, he sent to the
state department two communications.
One complains against the enforce
ment of a general embargo on ship
ments to Mexico: the other recites
that Mexican citizens have been ar
rested without cause in California ;nd
Arizona. They warn Secretary Lan
sing that the present situation be
tween the two governments cannot
fail to be gravely aggravated by these;
matters although setting forth that
the ambassador assumes that local
authorities, not the state department,
were responsible for the trouble.
So far as is known, the state de
partment has not been advised of the
detentions of Mexicans. It is an open
secret, however, that a partial em
bargo on commerce between the Unit
ed States and Mexico is being en
forced effectually by customs and
army officers without the authority
of a formal proclamation.
Efforts to sound administration of
ficials anew today, as to their atti
tude toward some form of arbitration
met with a chilling reception. Charles;
A. Douglas recently employed as Gen
eral Carranza's legal advisor here,
called on Counsellor Polk at the state
department. He and Dr. Victor A.
Pendon, head of the Yucatan sisal
commission, had received word from
Luis Cabrera, the Mexican finance
minister, that General Carranza was
disposed to appeal to the arbitration
I revisions of the treaty of 1S4S. pro
vided the United States was willing to
submit the dispute to peaceful nego
tiations. Mr. Douglas is understood to have
suggested that the arbitration provid
ed for under section 21, of the treaty,
could well be employed to formulate
a definiea question as between the
two governments, which In turn might
be settled by mediation. He left the
conference with the clear impression
that the Washington government
would listen to no mediation sugges
tions. "IM-M-
It has been very plainly indicated
that unconditional surrender of the
American prisoners held at Chihuahua.
City would be the only immediate step
General Carranza could take to avoid
hostilities. Whether a mediation pro
posal might be considered after their
release is a matter of speculation.
Officials have no desire even to talk
matters over on a hypothetical basis,
founded on what might be pissible if
the prisoners were giveti up. Xo per
son interested in maintaining peace
between the governments has been
able to obtain any statement as to
what might be accomplished toward
