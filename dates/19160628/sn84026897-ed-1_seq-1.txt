REMINISCENT VEIN.
Summary of Address Delivered
by Rev. R. G. Shannon
_ house at Monthly Union
Service June 18.
Ten years atro, in the month of
December, we arrived in Edgefield
to become the rector of the Episco
pal church. It was a cold, rainy,
dark night. We took a hack to
ride to our temporary home on the
outskirts of the village. That ride
always will be assjciated in mem
ory with a certain odor. Odors are
very strong agents for recalling
memories; and the odor that niirht
was very strong. It was the smell
of whiskey on the breath of our
driver.
As there were no street lights
then, and the streets were deep with
winter mud and holes, our first im
pressions of Edgefield were rather
disheartening. When I came down
town next morning it seemed that
the whiskey influence was even
worse than we feared, for it was
Saturday, and there was a great
crowd of country people in town,
and it seemed that every other man
was drinking, and a majority of
them were loaded down with bot
tles and jugs of the stuff. There
was also a great deal of rough talk
and swearing and a number of tisrhts
during that day, and on uutil after
Christmas.
But there were redeeming fea
tures. After meeting the men of
the county and town I learned that
the conditions were abnormal tem
poiarily. Whiskey was very much
in evidence for the time being sim
ply because the good people of
Edgefield had just voted out the
dispensary. It would in a few days
be closed up forever. Those who
patronized it, particularly the ne
groes were simply laying in a sup- j
ply for a dry lime. In a short;
time conditions would be greatly
improved.
$?~-?->w?8- tdd. And so I have
iiv?d to see the fmpToved conditions.
Likewise I found immediately that
Edgefield people as a class were the
warmest hearted, most cordially re
sponsive and most hospitable peo
ple in the world. She had and has
yet many fine men, and finer wo
men.
During these ten years I have ob
served many changes for good.
As a citizen of Ed<refield and as a
minister I can speak of such things
very plainly and without an.\ per
sonal thought whatever. In thc
line of improvement, therefore, the
most marked improvement has been
exhibited in the matter of temper
ance. We never see any more the
agonizing pictures of drunkenness
on the streets. The disorder of
profane language, fighting, even
bloodshed that used to be manifested
are things of the past. In place of
it we have a most wholesome public
sentiment for order, for temperance,
for education, for civic improve
ment as well as for religion.
And when I observe these things
I feel like taking off my hat to the
noble women of the W. C. T. U. of
Edgefield for having done more
than any other human agency for
bringing things to pass. With in
finite patience, hope and love rather
than the usual methods of worldly
force they have done their work as
the church does hers, as Christ did
His, by persuasion, by instruction,
by example ind by prayer. Ten
years ago they had seven or eight
brave and public spirited members.
To-day I understand that they have
over eighty. How much they have
had to do with engendering a pub
lic spirit for righteousness with all
tiiat it involves in community life
no one can estimate.
In education it has been mani
fested in more and better school
buildings, and' more teachers and
better teachers and methods.
In civic improvement it shows in
better and cleaner streets, in having
the town well lighted by an up-to
date electric system, in a well kept
and beautiful cemetery, in a public
library, in a great spirit of co-opera
tion in all public endeavors, such as
the celebrations of religious gather
ings, the Confederate veterans, the
chautauquas and public charities of
all kinds.
And it is shown chiefly by our
having regularly, once a month, a
union service of all the religious

To THE PEOPLE OF EDGEFIELD COUNTY:
A crisis confronts the American people.
The soil of our country has-been invaded, and the
blood of our citizens has been sfed by Mexican soldiers.
Our President has responded to the demands of patri
otism up to the full measure of Jhe best traditions of our
republic.
' The Governor of our State 'has issued his "CALL
FOR SERVICE," and the people of Edgefield will re
spond up to the full measure of the glorious example of our
fathers.
We are reminded of the Alamo and the heroic death
of Edgefield's sons-Bonham, Bouie, Crockett and Travis.
We recall the fame of the Palmetto Regiment at
Cherubusco, and rejoice in the memory that the flag of the
Palmetto Regiment was "FIRST OF ALL" seen to be
lifted above the wall of the Capital City of Mexico.
We recall the heroic days from 1865 to 1861, when the
sons of Edgefield "poured out their blood like water'' for
Southern Independence; and we are proud of the memory
of the services and sacrifices of .our fathers and brothers in
those days that tried men's son?|||;
"We are reminded that .w|???^he President issued his
call to rescue the oppressed Ci?baS frcm- Spanisn tyrannjv
the sons of Edgefield were among the first to offer their
services.
The Edgefield Rifles, among the oldest and most dis
tinguished commands of South Carolina, should be reorgan
ized at once, and tender their services to the Governor.
The memories of the achievements of the Edgefield
Rifles must be preserved and transmitted by their sons.
Therefore, we call upon thc sons of Edgefield county
to assemble in our Court House on next Saturday after
noon, the 1st day of July, at 5:00 P. M., to reorganize the
Edsefield Rifles.
Lovely Occasion.
Mrs. B. E. Nicholson and Mrs.
Lovick Minis were hostesses on
Wednesday afternoon from five to
seven o'clock at a reception. This
occasion was somewhat tinged with
a pleasant mystery, and Dickens
says that to surround any subject
with an atmosphere of mystery is to
give it wonderful attraction lo hu
man kind.
The beautiful veranda was filled
with lovely girls and guests coming
and going, and on one side fruit
punch from a handsome hand
painted punch bowl was dispensed
by Misses Natalie Padgett and May
Tompkins
Winthrop Scholarship.

There are no application blanks
to be used. Those who wish to
At the entrance was Miss Vir-! rakc lhe examination must write be
ginia Addison, Mrs. J. D. Holstein,
Mrs. Charles Griffin, Mrs. R. A.
Marsh, who greeted the guests and
ushered them into the parlor where
the receiving line stood.
Miss Lura Mims was the guest of
honor, and a line of beautiful girls
stood with her, and Mrs. Nicholson
and Mrs. Minis on each side as the
guests entered.
Refreshments of ice cream and
cake were served in the diuing room
and mints, the color scheme being
pink and white.
As the guests returned from the
place of refreshment, they were
greeted by Misses Rose Hill and
Sallie Dunovant, who presented
each one with a souvenir, which
solved the mystery which every one
was trying to explore. This was
the announcement of the marriage
of Miss Lura Minis to Mr. P. B.
Day on the 2d of August.
The idea was beautifully unfolded
and the afternoon was happily spent.

Another Wet Argument Punc
tured.
Federal officers who have been
quietly investigating in West Vir
ginia say that there is in that state
a marked reduction in the use of
habit forming drugs-cocaine,
opium, heroin and the like. They
declare that West Virginia-a pro
hibition state-is living up to the
anti-drug law more rigidly than any
other state in the union. How is
that for a reply to the contention of
the wets that state-wide prohibition
of the beverage liquor traffic inva
riably increases the use of habit
forming drugs?-Palmetto White
Ribbon.
MOUNTAIN CREEK.
Two Services. Children's Exer
cises in the Forenoon. Large
Attendance. Bountiful
Dinner Served.
While the old mother county,
Edgefield, has been cut to the bone
on three sides, supply in jr territory
for other counties, yet these lines
are largely imaginary and do not af ter
all separate our people. When there
is a gathering along the border in
either of the counties all of the peo
ple come together as one people,
there being no Greenwood people,
no Edgefield people, no Saluda peo
pie. A striking instance of this
continued oneness of our people
was found in the large congregation
that gathered at Mountain Creek
Creek church Sunday, the occasion
being the observance of chil
dren's day. While Mountain Creek
is located in Greenwood county, yet
the people of Edgefield have a deep
and abiding interest in the church
and community, and likewise many
who reside in Saluda county are ac
tively identified with the church.
The advent of the automobile
makes easily possible the mint ling
together of people from widely sep
arated communities. There were
probably thirty or forty cars upon
the churchyard Sunday, some hav
ing come from Greenwood, Ninety
Six. Saluda, and other places equal
ly as remote. When properly used,
automobiles can be made to serve a
high and holy parp?se on the Sab
bath but when mode a vehicle for
strenuous desecration they become to
that extent, a curse to their owners.
The forenoon was devoted to ex
ercises by the children, handsome
James Faulkner, a son of Mr. and
Mrs. Y. M. Faulkner, acting as mas
ter of ceremonies. The programme
w'as miscellaneous in character, be
ing composed of recitations, drills,
dialogues, songs and choruses. Not
many churches, owing to sparsely
settled rural communities, have such
i-a wealtli-of-bright boys and-girls-wbo*
are willing to take part in public
exercises. In this particular Moun
tain Creek is especially fortunate.
And the church is blessed also in
having capable and consecrated
leaders. Mrs. Y. M. Faulkner has
for a number of years been the zeal
ous leader of the missionary work
among the women and it was due
to her efforts, more than any other
individual member, that such an ex
cellent programme was presented
Sunday. A day thus spent is al
ways wholesome and helpful to all
who attend. In addition to dis
seminating information and arous
ing interest and enthusiasm through
the appropriate recitations, it is a
means of developing the boys and
young people for future service in
larger fields. The children and
young people were well supported
Sunday morning by the splendid
singing of the church choir and
these dozen or more singers were
accompanied by the organ and vio
lin. For good singing, as well as
decided talent along other lines,
Mountain Creek church is especially
blessed.
A collection was taken, just be
fore adjourning for dinner, for the
benefit of a resident of the commu
nity who owing to continued illness
has been largely dependent during
the past year upon the generous
people of the community for the
actual necessities of life. More than
*2U was contributed for this very
worthy purpose.
After an adjournment of two
hours, which time was spent in par
taking of the bountiful dinner and
in social intercourse, the people re
assembled iu the church for the af
ternoon service which was presided
over by Kev. Gr. S. Wells, who bas
been serving the church as pastor
since April and who is rapidly es
tablishing himself in the affections
of his Mock. Mrs. Mamie N. Till
man, the leader ot the Sunbeam
work in the Edgefield association,
was present by invitation and was
the first to speak in the afternoon.
Her remarks were- addressed chiefly
to the children and young people
of tim congregation, the interest be
ing intensified by the use of illus
trated charts upon which tho eyes
of the children were constantly fix
ed. Mrs. Tillman was followed by
Mrs. J. L. Minis who spoke of the
early founding of the woman's mis
sionary work at Mountain Creek,
giving a brief history of the organi
zation. She also urged the ladies

Editor Edenfield Advertiser:
As I have been so fortunate that
my past letters have not reached
the waste basket, I will continue to
write. We farmers are still having
war with "General Green," but he
is very rapidly surrendering to us.
We only wish we could say that
much about the Mexicans, so our
good boys would not be called off.
We wish to correct a missprint
in our last piece about our mission
ary meeting. We don't want oar
efood friends to think that we only
meet annually, we meet once a
month at the home of Mrs. S. B.
M ays.
The family and relatives of Mr.
Sam Roper, gave him quite a pleas
ant surprise last Wednesday by cel
ebrating his 77th birthday, each one
that came bringing a well-rilled bas
ket. Mr. Roper says he ate until
his capacity was exhausted.
