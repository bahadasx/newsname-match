threatened to destroy an'entire block
of business homes.
The flames started shortly after 12
o'clock this noon and spread so
rapidly that it was impossible to save
any of the mail or stock in the store.
The entire building burned to the

Favorable to Restriction of
Liquor Traffic, Says Anti
Saloon Speaker.
Indianapolis, June 28.—Charles Ev
ans Hughes, republican candidate for
president, while on the supreme bench
ottered opinions "that stamp him as
fusing favorable to restriction of the
liquor traffic," according to Wayne B.
Fheeler, of Washington, D. C„ gen
aral counsel of the anti-saloon league
6f-America, in ah address to the sev
enteenth convention of that organiza-
'•'•$. "llie courts," said Mr. Wheeler,

Mr. Wheeler asserted that the bur
den of pronouncement by the courts,
state and federal, was against the
liquor traffic. Speaking on the subject,
"The Court's Part in the Solution of
the Saloon Problem," Mr. Wheeler
continued:
"Federal laws prohibiting every
phase' bf the traffic doubtless will be
upheld, when our federal constitution
is given jurisdiction over the sale and
manufacture for sale of intoxicating
liquor.
"The court has done more than con
strue laws and establish rights. It has
pointed the way to civic duty. En
lightened citizenship cannot escape
the logic of these decisions
"In these days of appeal for patriot
ism and preparedness, let us listen to
the logic of the court. First kill the
liquor traffic. This will safeguard the
public health and morals, and protect
the wealth and happiness of the peo
ple. It will insure the perpetuity of a
great nation, a power ordained of God
to advance civilization."

Inoculation of the troops against
typhoid fever, will begin immediately
and continue, at the rate of about
three companies a day. It is proba
ble that •whatever physical examina

at that time. This will take three or
four days and if all is done here, it is
certain that the regiment will have to
stay over the remaining two days for
which rations have been issued.
The officers are reticent about what
will be done with the troops, although
they do say the camp here will not be
a long one.
Much gratification is being experi
enced by the officers over the appoint
ment of Dr. G. ... M. Williamson of
Grand Forks to the medical staff, and
the boys of the two companies of that
place are jubilant.
The first rain since the troops went
into camp Is falling, and it Is a heavy
one. It began while the regiment
was at drill, driving the 'Companies
in at double time and soaking them
to the skin.

CRUCIAL DAT IN CRISI6.

If a reply, either by act, or In a communication does not arrive by
tonight, or If It Is necessary. President Wilson Is determined to go be
fore congress, probably tomorrow, and ask authority to rescue the
prisoners by force.
Unofficial reports today said Carranza's reply was enroute to Wash

RESULTS IN
Rain general throughout North Da
kota is cutting down the vote materi
ally in the primary election today.
Although this is particularly the
case in the rural districts, the effect
Is also very noticeable in many of the
cities. In some sections the roads are
practically impassable, making it al
most impossible for the farmers to
reach the polls.
In Grand Forka the vote at 3
o'clock this afternoon appeared to be
moderately heavy in some precincts,
and light In others. As a general
rule, however, it appears that as far
as this city is concerned the. vote will
be at least sormal.
