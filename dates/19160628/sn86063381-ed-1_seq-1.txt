RECRUITING STATIONS
IN ST. PAUL CLOSED
St. Paul Civil War Veteran Says it
Will Take Army of 500,000
Five Years.
(By United Press)
St. Paul, Minn., June 28.Three
thousand one hundred fifty-eight
members of the Minnesota national
guard encamped at Fort Snelling to
day, are being mustered into Federal
service. The work of putting the
men under Federal enrollment ser
vice started with the Third regiment
late today. It may take two days
before the men are signed. The mus
ter is being made with the men in
regimental formation.
U. Men Take Oath.
The khaki clad state troops were
lined up in regimental streets and
mustering officers were assigned each
section. Each man took the oath and
signed the Federal papers separately.
That there might be some mur
muring against taking the federal
cath was admitted. But officials in
sisted that very few of these would
show themselves. One officer char
acterized these men who "didn't
want to go" as the "rats" of the
guard, and these, he said, would be
quietly eliminated. Officers, he
said, don't want them. When a re
port that a man has murmured
against taking the federal oath seems
founded, that man is simply and
quietly eliminated in the federal ex
amination, it is said. This elimina
tion, he said, would be "inspired"
and a "rat," he said, couldn't get in
to the service no matter how physic
ally fit he might be.
Stations CLeied.
Recruiting stations in St. Paul
were closed today and the men com
manding them moved to the state
concentration camp. "The joining of
Battery A and Battery of the ar
tillery brought this one amalgamated
battery to full strength and pre
vented necessity of further attempt
ing to get recruits.
That the United States needs 500,-
000 men to lick Mexico if she starts
such a stunt, was the statement of
Col. J. H. Davidson of St. Paul, Civil
war veteran, who has had military
experience in Mexico. He visited the
state camp, today, reviewing the boys
in camp and recalling his own blood
stained blue uniform of '61. He
says it will take five years to finish
the job. He described the border as
an actual line made of iron stakes.
Hour to Entrain.
It would take just about one hour,
to .get some of Minnesota's forces
started for the border if they were
ordered at once, army officers said.
There are a lot, of things to be done,
but just one thing would be done
if the order came and that would be
entrain.
Extended order drill, bayonet prac
tice and the manual of arms occu
pied the attention of the boys today.
Major Cook says there will be no
ceremonies: no dress parades no
guard mounts and nothing but good
hard work for the boys until they
entrain. Boiled shirt procedure is
barred. A special consignment of
government supplies to uniform some
recruits and furnish all the boys
with mess kitchens were enroute
here today. i
It's going to be hot in Mexico for
all the state guard. So Uncle Sam
is arranging for that. The Seeger
Refrigerator Co., St. Paul, today
shipped four carloads of refrigera
tors to the army on the border where
refrigerators are most needed.
qrookston's Co. I, Third infantry,
had %375 today, contributed by
Crookston citizens to buy luxuries.
Although W J. Bryan, prince of
peace, has declared that getting into
mediation without the administra
tion's consent would be inconsistent
with supporting the president, the
Woman's Welfare League Of St. Paul
was today on record favoring media
tion.
John E. Bobleter, son of the late
Gen. Bobleter, today thanked Gov
ernor J. A. A. Burnquist for naming
the state mobilization camp for his
father.
A bad cold, worry, overwork and
loss of sleep has placed Adj. Gen. F.
B. Wood in a bad physical condition
today, but he keeps right at it.
Every member of the Rochester,
machine gun company, now mobil
ized at Fort Snelling, will have a
neat pocket edition of the Bible for
use in Mexico. Citizens presented
them.
Just 3,158 members of the guard
were today searching through the
entire camp for a picture of Private
R. C. Mont's mother, which the sol
dier carried for years and lost.
Have 45,000 Indians.
Galveston, June 28.The Mexican
consulate today reported that 45,000

Asks for Arbitration.
