The Difficulties On the Path to Success Have Always Been There. Those Who Have Travelled That Road Had To Climb Over the Rocks

EE
JUDGE HOWE'S METHODS
Vermont Judge Is Popular ir
York. ; ' ..;
For the first time in me insiory o..
the Brooklyn Federal court the addi
tional services of a visiting judge were
required, during tho past two weeks to
prevent undue congestion of the court
calendar.
United States Judge llarland B.
Howe of Vermont was brought here
for this purpose and he has created a
profound impression by his informality
of manner, his willingness to unbend
1'rom the stiff dignity of his ofllce to
converse with attorneys though the
bench did not separate them, and by
this liberality and democratic methods
says the Brooklyn Eagle.
"I strive to make the atmosphere of
the courtroom free, Indulgent and con
siderate,' said Judge Howe. "I believe
that all persons coming to court should
go out feeling that they have been ac
corded courteous and considerate treat
ment and if they haven't won their
case they have had fair treatment.
"I liavo always maintained that tho
judges should be the most humble and
most tolerant persons about a court
house. Why should a man who has be
come a judge be otherwise? Why
shouldn't he be more considerate and
more humble than before?
"Just because a man is a judge and
has got a lot of power he should use
it very sparingly, and that in the plan
I try to follow."'
Direct from his native district where
as he expresses it, ho is a plain coun
try man, Judge Howe came to Brook
lyn at the request of the presiding jus
tice and the brief period on the Brook
lyn Bench that has just ended has re
vealed to the astonished and delighted
members of the bar that his honor prac
tices what he preaches.
Judge Howe's arrival banished that
fiigid and restrained atmosphere from
the courtroom at once. His informali
ty and pleasant manner in discussing
cases with lawyers and witnesses made
litigants and representatives in trials
feel at east, and the somber surround
ings of the trial room actually seemed
to brighten up as though sunshine had
been let in through the windows.
Had it not been for the fact that his
honor wore his judicial robes and that
the courtroom furniture and fittings
were part of the scene, the trial of
cases before him might have been tak
en for an impartial and friendly dis
cussion, free from restraint, due to the
elevation or rank of one of tho partlci'
jiants.
Yet with it all ho combines a dig
nity that in no way sacrifices the con
ception in the mind's eye among lay
men and members of tho bar and
bench of what a judge, In his outward
department, should stand for.
Chief among tho beneficiaries of the
jurist's friendly style of conducting
trials, have been the lawyers. Every
one familiar with courtroom procedure
knows how much the presiding judge's
attitude influences a lawyer's conduct
of a case. Under the informal spell of
Judge Howe's presence lawyers in
cases before him astonished even them
selves with the lack of restraint and
freedom with which they brought out
their cases.
"I have been shamefully abused dur
ing my twenty years as a member of
the bar practicing before judges," said
Judge Howe, "and I made up my mind
that if I ever was elevated to the
bench I would not tolerate such con
duct on my own part.
"In some instances I have known
young lawyers, at the very stage when
they needed the most encouragement,
to go into court and to be so abused
that in some cases they have gone out
of the courtroom never to return
"I always criticised the courts when
I was a practicing attorney, and I have
been the victim of sonic such shameful
treatment, A judge In my opinion,
should bo the most humble and most
tolerant person about a courthouse.
Not only in his attitude, but in his
manner from the legal standpoint, did
Judge Howe create surprises. When a
prisoner, after a trial, is to bo sentenc
ed, Judge Howe takes botli the District
Attorney and tho counsel for tho do
fenso into his confidence as to tho na
turo of the sentence, leaving nothing
to his own complete Judgment.
Asking first what penalty the govern
ment prosecutor thinks adequate and
then the same question of the convict
ed man's counsel, ho arrives at a con
elusion that brings satisfaction all
around.
"Why shouldn't I do this?" ho asked
"The District Attorney and the counsel
for the defense have both the snme
standing In court. Why shouldn't I
seek advice as much from one as tho
other? When I was practicing 1 sel
dom or never had a Judge ask mo what
1 thought would be an adequate fine or
penalty for my client, though ho ol
ways sought the opinion of tho govern
ment prosecutor, in pursuing my
present courso I believe I am going to

JAUSTRIAHS ill

Teuton and Slav War Offices Admit
Importance of Operations
HIMDENBURG MOVING ON RIGA
Petrograd Announces that Defences of
Seaport Are Holding Off
Attacks.
London, June 27. The most impor
tant action on the Eastern front during
the last twenty-four hours took place
southwest of Kolkl, in the section
where the Germans have concentrated
the bulk of their forces to bar the door
to Kovel and if possible to drive the
Russians out of Volhynla. Berlin this
afternoon announced olllcially that
Russian lines in this region were
stormed, the Germans taking several
hundred prisoners. Russian counter
attacks failed.
Both the Austrian and Russian War
Office statements tonight indicate that
the battle on the Kolki-Sokul front ov
er-shadows in violence and important
all other operations in the East at pres
en:.
Field Marshal von llindenburg for
the first time since Gen Brusiloff's of
fensive began, assumed the offensive
in the Riga section, which forms the
extreme left wing of the far (lung: Teu
ton battle line. He attacked the Rus
sians between Lakes Dolja and Yoltch
ino and to the northeast of Lake
Vygonovskoie. Tonight's Russian of
ficial report asserts the attacks were
repulsed.
get pretty nearly the right result."
Although tlo Vermont jurist has
plainly evidenced the fact that he is ex
ercising a bountiful degree of tolerance
and consideration in his trials he never
thclcss, keeps wisdom and common
sense to the foreground in his acts. Ho
never lets sympathy blind his sense
ol justice and it takes a shrewd pris
oner to fool the judge.
This was amply illustrated last week
when a man convicted of stealing eigh
teen pounds cf brass from the Navy
Yard came before him for sentence.
Why did you steal this material?"
his honor asked, beaming upon the
prisoner, in a kindly manner. His
friendly way evidently deceived the ac
cused man, who thought that a pathe
tic story would set him free.
I stole it," he answered "because I
wanted to make some toys lor my
eight months old child."
'For that story I shall give you thir
ty days In t ho city prison, Icily re
toited Judge Howe. "If you had told
me the truth I might have been leni
cut."
nother innovation that Judge Howe
has introduced in his sittings in Brook
lyn is to consult with lawyers on both
sides before making the charge to the
jury. This has been greatly uppreiiat
ed by both the District Attorney's of
lice and the counsel for the defense.
"1 always do this," said Judge Howe
I prepare the charge in writing before
counsel begin to sum up, and submit it
to them for their consideration, asking
them their opinion on it. Between the
throe of us we arrive at a conclusion
that will be known to us all. Either
they modify their plans to suit mine or
I change my charge."
Unlike most other Jurists Judge
Howe leads his cluirgo from a written
paper to t lu; jurymen, so as to prevent
error. Judge Howe is an ardent advo
cate of hard work as a sure road to
success.
For n young man I know of no bet
ter way to get started than to begin
practice in some small city or town,
alone. It will make a man self-reliant
and the necessity of making ends meet,
away from home, will make him get
out and do his utmost. I haven't much
consideration for genius, but I think a
whole lot of hard work."
Judge Howe Is a self-educated man
anil he believes this kind gives the best
and most lasting results. He began
practice In his home town In St. Johns
bury, when he was 21.
There are two kinds of education,"
he explained. "The one we get from
others, and the one that we get our
selves. The only kind that is good for
anything Is the kind we get ourselves."
Judge Howe was appointed to his
present position on the bench on
March 8. 1 1 5 by President Wilson. Ho
Is a democrat and was twice candidate
for governor of his native state. He
isn't even middle aged In appearance
wears 'dark hair long and has the
marks of a stateinan.

IT TROLLY NEAR
STATE LIKE
Man lying on Track When Hit By
Westbound Car
DRESSED LIKE LUMBERJACK
Victim cf Accident Evidently Died In
stantly as Spine and Other Bones
Were Broken.
An unknown man, apparently a lum
berjack, was killed by a trolley car
on the lloosick Falls division of the
Berkshire street railway system last
evening about one hundred yards west
of the New York state line. The ac
cident happened at 9.20 while the car
leaving here at 8.ui) was on its way to
lloosick. Falls in charge of Conductor
John James and Motorman John Flood
The man was lying on the track and
was mt observed by Motorman Flood
in time to check the speed of the car.
Drs. E. A. Tohin and V. A. Flood of
Noith Bennington were summoned by
telephone and went immediately to the
scene of the accident. Judging from
the condition of the body, which was
not badly mangled, Die physicians
were of tho opinion that the man was
killed instantly. The neck was brok
en as were several ribs. Acting upon
instructions from the coroner the bodv
was taken to lloosick Falls for the
necessary inquest required by the laws
of New York.
The man wore the clothing of a lum
berman and was unknown to any one
of the numerous persons who gathered
at the scene when the news of the ac
cident spread through the neighbor
hood. While no definite Information
to that effect was obtainable the opin
ion was advanced that he had been em
ployed by some of the lumber compan
ies operating in the vicinity of Man
chester.
Circumstances would Indicate that
the victim of the accident was intoxi
cated and that the fatality is one more
addition to the numerous killings of
the same nature that have resulted in
tliis locality from a similar cause.

Washington, June 2S. A reply to
President Wilson's demand for the
release of the American troopers held
as prisoners in Mexico is expected this
afternoon. The belief is based upon
a telegram received from Consul Hodg
ers at Mexico City.
Washington, June 27. Unless C.en.

troopers held at Chihuahua City before
tomorrow night President Wilson prob
ably will go betore Congress Thursday
to ask for authority to rescue them by
force. Pending their release the Unit
ed States government will not consid
er any offer of mediation or arbitra
tion The state department had no inti
mation tonight as to when a reply to
the note sent Sunday demanding im
mediate release of the soldiers might
be expected. It was delivered yester
day at 11 a. m-.-i Special Agent Rodg
ers has been Unable to forecast the ac
tion of the de fncto authorities.
Prompt compliance by Congress
with any request the president may
make as to Mexico was foreshadowed
today by tho calm which prevailed in
both houses. Although measures de
signed to prepare for war were under
consideration and the corridors of the
eapitol hummed with rumors, there
was no excitement and discussion of
tho subject on the floor -was avoided.
Tho legislative branch of the govern
ment was plainly waiting to do Its
part when what the majority regarded
as inevitable should come.
It has been very plainly indicated
that unconditional surrender of the
Americ an prisoners held at Chihuahua
would be the only immediate step Gen.
Carran.a could take to avoid hostili
ties. Whether a mediation proposal
might be considered after their re
leaso is n matter of speculation. Of
ficials have no desire even to talk mat
ters over on a hypothetical basis
founded on what might he possible if
the prisoners were given up.
There is reason to believe, however,
that a plan which did not involve a
military status quo in Mexico and the
consequent hampering of Gen. Funs
ton's dispositions to guard the Inter
national line from raiders would be
considered at least if the captured
troopers were freed first.
The state department late in the
day received Its first ollicial news of
the cavalrymen prisoners from other
than Mexican sources. Tim llrituh

CAMPAIGN FOK MEMBERS
Green Mountain Club Held Meeting to
Boost Membership,
The executive committee of tho
Green Mountain Club held a meeting
in Griswold's store Tuesday evening
and discussed plans for an increase in
the membership.
The club now numbers about 100
members and 150 is the goal set for
the campaign. Interest in the Green
Mountain club has waned somewhat
this year because bad weather has dis
couraged open air excursions. I-ast
year the club has six successful hikes.
To awaken interest in the organization
it is planned to get more members and
with t he arrival of better weather, get
something tangible started.
Membership in the club is $1 a year
and application should be made to any
or tlie oflicers. William I. Hare is
president this year, J. Lawrence Gris
wold. vice president and Miss Brigie
McGuirc, secretary and treasurer. Tho
objects of the club arc not so much
the individual benefits resulting to
members, but rather the continuation
of an organization to keep the moun
tain trails in good condition and aid
summer visitors in Uniting their way
through tho Green Mountains. Mem
bers, however, have the use of tho
Green Mountain Cabin in Hell Hollow
and also derive entertainment from
the club hikes w hich are planned about
a fortnight apart.
At the meeting last evening a report
of the trail committee was heard and
tho work of clearing and marking
about lo miles of trail between Strat
ton Mountain and Manchester ap
proved. The club Is to try the first hike o
t lie season Sunday afternoon. Mem
bers will meet at the end of tho Main
