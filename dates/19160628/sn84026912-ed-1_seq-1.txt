"Mr. Arredondo yesterday deliver
ed to this government tho following
om mu nica (ion:
" 'I am directed by my government
to inform your excellency, with refer
ence to the Carrizal Incident, that the
Chief Executive, through the Mexi
can war department, gave orders to
Gon. Jacinto B. Trevino not to per
mit American forces from Gon. Per
shing's column to advance further
south, nor to move either east or
west from the points where they are
located, and to oppose new incursions
of American soldiers into Mexican
territory. These orders were brought
by Gen. Trevino to the attention of
Gen. Pershing, who acknowledged the
receipt of the communication rela
tive thereto. On tho 22d instant, as
your excellency knows, an American
force moved eastward quite far from
its base, notwithstanding the above
orders, and was engaged by Mexican
troops at Carrizal, State of Chihua
hua. As a result of the encounter
several men on both sides were kill
ed and wounded, and 17 American
soldiers were made prisoners.'
Demands Made by U. S.
"You are hereby Instructed to hand
to the minister of foreign relations of
the de facto government the follow
ing:
" 'The government of the United
States can put no other construction
upon the communication handed to
the Secretary of State of the United
States on the 24th of June by Mr.
Arredondo, under instructions of
your government, than that it ls in
tended as a formal avowal of delib
erately hostile action against tho
forces of the United States now in
Mexico, and of tho purpose to attack
them without provocation whenever
they move from their present posi
tion in pursuance of the objects for
which they were sent there, notwith
standing the fact that those objects
not only involve no unfriendly inten
tion towards the government and
people of Mexico, but are on the con
trary, Intended only to assist that
government in protecting Itself and
the territory and people of the Uni
ted States against irresponsible and
insurgent bands of rebel marauders.
" 'I am instructed, therefore, by
my government to demand the imme
diate release of the prisoners taken
la the oncounter at Carrizal, together
with any property of the United
States taken with them, and to in
form you that tho government of tho
United States expects an early state
ment from your government as to
the course of action it wishes tho
government of tho United States to
understand lt has determined upon,
and that it also expects that this
statement bo made through tho usual
diplomatic channels, and not through
subordinate military commanders.' "

Report Reaches Washington.
Washington, June 26.-A report
that the American consulate at Torre

received at the State Department to

several days ago.
"TIMM IS INOPPORTUNE,
Suys Bolivian Diplomat-'May Yet
Suggesti Mediation, However,
Washington, June 20.-Efforts to
ward a Latin-American mediation lu
tho Mexican crisis, favored by Car
ranza officials, collapsed to-day with
out having reached tho stage of a
formal proposal to.tho United States.
lt was made plain by Secretary
Lansing to Ignacio Calderon, minis
ter of Bolivia, that tho Washington
government sees nothing in the situ
ation that would warrant arbitration
proceedings.
Mr. Lansing talked with the minis
ter for half an hour and is under
stood to have told him that the blame
for the grave outlook rested squarely
upon Cen. Carranza. The attitude of
the United States was so fully out
lined that Mr. Calderon did not men
tion directly tho original purpose of
his visit, which was to ask if the Uni
ted States would entertain an offer
of the services of its southern neigh
bors lo aid In averting war.
When the minister left the State
Department he said the time "seem
ed inopportune," and that for the
present tho diplomatic representa
tives of tho six South and Central
American countries who had ap
proached the Mexican embassy on the
subject of mediation and received as
surances that the Carranza govern
ment was favorable to the principle,
would not lender their good offices
to the United States, lie indicated
that the attempt to arrange media
tion might bo renewed If Cen. Gar?
ranza's reply to Secretary Lansing's
last noto furnished any basis on
which the proposal could bo founded.
Millions Nixxlod for Troops.
War Department activities during
the day covered a wide Held. Supple
mental orders to departmental com
manders called for greater haste in
getting the national guard to tho
border. Authorization went out to
accept men under tho physical ex
aminations on which they entered the
State service, postponing final exami
nation until they are on route or havo
reached the border. Those found un
fit will be sent back at once.
Estimates to cover the pay and
maintenance expenses of the State
troops, totaling $88,000,000 up to
January 1, were laid before Congress.
With them went figures of $13,000,
Out) for the purchase of horses and
mules for army use. The total esti
mates of the quartermaster general
alone pass the $1 00,000,000 mark.
Tho House passed the annual army
appropriation bill after adding $26,
000,000 for emergency purposes dur
ing tho brief d?bale that preceded
the vote. An urgent deficiency bill
carrying $25,000,000 for national

Musa lteleji.se by To-Night.
Washington, June 27-Unless Gen.
Carranza surrenders the 23 American
troopers held at Chihuahua City be
fore to-morrow night, President Wil
son probably will go beforo Congress
Thursday to ask for authority to res
cue them by force. Pending their
release, tho United States government
will not consider any offer of media
tion or arbitration.
The State Department had no inti
mation to-night as to when a reply to
the note sent Sunday demanding im
mediate release of tho soldiers might
he expected. It was delivered yester
day at ll a. m. Special Agent Rodg
ers has been unable to forecast tho
action of tho do facto authorities.
Prompt compliance by Congress
with any request the President may
make as to Mexico was foreshadowed
to-day by the calm which prevailed in
both Houses? Although measures de
signed to prepare for war were under
consideration and the corridors of
the Capitol hummed with rumors,
there was no excitement, and discus
sion of tho subject on the floor was
avoided. The legislative branch of
tho government was plainly walting
to do its part when what the major
ity regarded as inevitable should
come.
Mexican? Urged to Drink Blood.
El Paso, Texas, June 26.-Ameri
can refugees brought to tho border
Mexican newspapers to show to what
extent the anti-American feeling is
growing. An editorial in La Refor
ma, a semi-ofHcial paper published in
Saltillo, captioned "Blood," makes a
violent attack upon tho United States,
Its people and Its policies, and con
tinues:
"Above all, do not forget that at a
time of national need humanity is a
crime and frightfulness is a virtue.
"Pull put eyes, ?natch out hearts,
tear open breasts, drink-If you can

vaders from the cities of Yankee
land.
"In defense of liberty, be a Nero,
bo a Caligula-that is to be a good
patriot.
"Peace between Mexico and the
United States will be closed in throes
of terror and barbarism."
A refugee from Mexico City arriv
ing at tho border to-day, said that at
stations in Northern Durango men
and women who no longer had cloth
ing to cover themselves crowded
about the train and cried for food.
He said they fought over bits of or
