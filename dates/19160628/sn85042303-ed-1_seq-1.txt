American Officers be P :hed, and Steps be Taken to Pre

Policy of Washington r t Today and if Carranza
Fails to Act or Replies Untc , Break Between Two
Countries Appears Certainty . "Nfc "'oects Car.ranza's
Answer Some Time Today.
Washington, D. C, June 28.
A note protesting against
outrages against Mexicans, al
leged to have been committed
by the American force three
thousand strong, marching
from San Geronimo toward El
Valle, was sent to the state de
partment today by Arredondo
on instructions from Carranza.
He asks that the American
officers be punished and that
steps be taken to prevent a re
currence. There is nothing today to in
dicate any change of policy and
it is still expected that Wilson
will go before congress tomor
row, if Carranza fails to act or
replies unfavorably.
Nothing short of the imme
diate release of the prisoners
will be satisfactory and no pro
posals or suggestions on nego
tiations will be accepted.
Carranza's delay in replying
is believed here to be due large
ly to the hope of having South
American countries agree fully
to his course before he takes
the final step.
President Wilson told Sen
ator Lewis of Illinois today that
if he went to congress, he want
ed the situation discussed on a
non-partisan basis.

Expect Carranza's Reply
Washington, D. C, June 28.
Special Agent Rogers of
Mexico City advised the state
department today that he ex
pected to receive Carranza's
answer to the demand for the
release of the American pris
oners at Chihuahua some time
today. His brief message said
it was believed that the Mexi
cans are investigating the Car
rizal affair, but gave no indica
tions as to what would be the
nature of the reply.
Immense Troop Movement.
Chicago, 111., June 28. Orders were
issued today by General Varry, com
manding the central department, for
the immediate movement to the bor
der of all the units of Illinois, Mis
souri. Kansas, and Wisconsin national
juard, which are reasonably ready.
Ambassador Still Hopeful.
New York, June 28. Itomulo S.
Naton, the Argentine ambassador, is
sued a statement today in which he
said that although he had made media
tion offers, he has "confidence that
the present Mexico-United States crl
j sis will be peacefull settled."
Villa Story Denied.
Washington, D. C, June 28. The re
port that Villa and a' body of his fol
lowers have offered their services to
Carranza in the event of war with the
United States was denied here last
night by Eliseo Arredondo, Carranza's
Washington representative. He claims
to have been advised from Mexico
City that under no circumstances
would Villa or the bandits allied with
him be permitted to serve with the
Carranza troops.
Regardless of the fact that Arredon
do continues to preserve a calm front,
his family left Washington last night
en route to the Canadian border.

BE ACCEPTABLE
MERCHANTS Till
E FARE RE-
CO-OPERATIVE PLAN WILL. AF
FORD BUYING PUBLIC SPLEN
DID OPPORTUNITY TO DO THEIR
SHOPPING.
Twenty-eight of Ardmore's progres
sive merchants have already agreed
to co-operate with the Retailers' as
sociation's big co-operative sale, the
greatest trading eve-nt ever held in
this city, week of July 8 to July 15.
They are thoroughly enthused with
the plan to refund railroad fares on
the co-operative plan to 'their out-of-town
customers during this sale, and
when this in addition to the remark
able bargains in up to date merchan
dise, is taken into consideration, the
event will surpass any effort of its
kind ever made in Ardmore.
15y the plan, as previously announc
ed in The Ardmoreite, practically ev
ery merchant of importance in Ard
more is preparing to make a special
effort to draw people here to trade
during this big co-operative sale.
There will be special bafrgains at
nearly every store, and the wise, eco
nomical buyers can certainly save
money by 'taking advantage of the
unusual opportunity to do their shop
ping in Ardmore during the week of
July 8 to 15.
Not only are the merchants going
to make special inducements to the
buying public in the way of price9
and assortment of seasonable mer
chandise but in addition they have ar
ranged to refund the railroad fares.
The great feature of the eight days
co-operative sale is that during that
time, from July S to July 15, twenty
right merchants will all have their
merchandise, including some of the
greatest bargains ever offered, ready
for the shoppers.
Never before in the history of Ard
more have the merchants all got
ten together and made a joint salp,
but they figure that shoppers will be
wise enough to take advantage of the
occasion and that large numbers will
attend.
Don't forget that you can get your
photograph taken, get a "coke" or a
few new decorations for your hat,
small purchases and that you will
get credit for every penny and all
will be counted in so you can get
your fare refunded in cash. If you
do not reach the required amount to
get round trip allowed, you can get
your fare one way for half that
amount
And the beauty of It all is, you will
be paid this in cash by one of the
twenty-eight merchants with whom
you will trade.
A pleasing feature of this part of
the arrangement -as previously stated
is the fact that a person is not com
pelled to make his purchase all at
one store, but he can, on the con
trary, trade at as many different i
stores as he may like, the only pro-!
vision being that the aggregate
amount of his purchases equal the sum !
designated in the published schedule, j
Say, for instance, a person coming
from a town where the amount to
be purchased is $20, can, if desired,
trade at twenty different stores, I
spending $1 at each place and still i

GOOD ROADS
FEVER STRUCK
- CARTER CO.
AT MEETING FRIDAY NIGHT IT
IS EXPECTED THAT INTEREST
ING THINGS WILL DEVELOP
BOND ISSUE ALMOST CERTAIN.
The good roads fever has struck
Ardmore and Carter county and the
Ardmore and Carter county good
roads meeting on Friday promises to
be one of the biggest and most enthu
siastic ever held in the city. Farmers
from all over the county are expected
to attend, as they have been notified
that the meeting has been gotten up
for their benefit and that they will
be expected to have speakers at the
meeting to express themselves fully.
The committee of business men nrd
still at work and will have a com
plete report to make as to the status
of affairs In the county. The commit
tee will recommend a bond Issue, but
the amount will not be large at this
time, as they believe that the entire
county will be willing to vote bonds
of about one hundred thousand dol
lars, so that some roads can be built
which will settle the question of all
future road improvement.
It is being pointed out -that the
property owners of the city of Ard
more will have to pay three fifths of
the taxes to retire the bonds, but that
will not be necessary, as the oil tax
will get nearly seventy-ilve thousand
dollars every year on the present rate
of production, and the law provides
that th!j money can be used to re
fund the bonds. As the bonds will be
twenty-five years bonds, it moans that
less than ten thousand dollars per
year will be necessary to take care of
the bonds, and that the balance of
the oil money can be used eacli year
to extend the permanent roads and to
maintain others.
Altogether ithe outlook for real
roads In Carter county is at last very
good, and Friday's meeting will tell
the tale.

at Muskogee.
The Murray bill, which withdraws
the unallotted oil lands of the Creek
tribe, was also favo!ably reported.

in his other campaign the Colonel
