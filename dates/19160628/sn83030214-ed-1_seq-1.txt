In the rernrting of this forr-e
Colonel RooBerelt ha^s been baep for
the last ten days through age.nta in
this rrty and various parta of the
country. lt was deelared on hrgh |
authonty lnst night that the plans ,
wr-rr- so romple'e tr;ht mobilization of '
the division at a given point can be
gin at two hours' notiee, th" plans for
ita formation, itg officers, and rquip- (
ment having been completed to the
minutest detarl aome weeks ago.
This m siibatance ia the announce

in this city last night. At, the same

Colonel's plans for recrurtir.g th*

authoritiea, and received their ap

Kooaevelt's Plan for Dirlslon.
As outhned the Roosevelt plan ralls
for a drvia-.on of four brigades, one
infantry, one field artiilery and two
of cavalry, to be officered by men of
the regular service or men who have
aeen actual service. In addition it
will have an aero aouadron, a fully
equipped hospital section, the uaual
machine gun diviaion and an en
g-.neermg corps.
The deeiaioD of Colonel Rooaerelt
to take thia gtep waa reached, it is |
understood, ten days ago, when th*
President de.-ided to call out the Na?

time his mail had for weeks been
fillad with offers of service from men
who had served with him in the war

The bulk of these offera came from
Indivlduala, but in many eaaea whole

Humor and Seriousness
To get into The4 Trtbun** Magazine an article-or a
picture?doesn't have to b- ecreamingly funny. Nor
does it have to be grimly aerious. But it does have to be
out of the commonplace.
That is why you hnd Thi* Tribune Magazine'a humor
ro entertamins* and its seriousness so instructive. That
i* why you will usually find a note of humor in its senous
talk and an underruirent of seriousness beneath its
humor. The Tribune Magazine has proved that the two
are not incompatible. That is why so many folks turn
to it the first thing Sunday morninga?and why so many,
as you should, speak to their newsdealers in advance.
