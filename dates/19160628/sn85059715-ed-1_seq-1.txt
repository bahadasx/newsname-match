Washington government's position had
undergone any change. Officials still
expected President Wilson to go before
Congress tomorrow if Carranza
fails to act or replies unfavorably. Anything

The fact that the men were captured
and were being held was viewed as a
hostile net requiring Immediate repudiation

Carmnzn's delay in replying is believed
here to be due largely to his*
| hope to have South and Central American
countries agree fully to his course
before he takes n final step.
