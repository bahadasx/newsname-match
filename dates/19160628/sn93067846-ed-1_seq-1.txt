MANNING PRAISES SPIRIT.
GOVERNOR WILL VISIT CAMP
MOORE TOMORROW.
Chief Executive Interested in Health
Measures for Protection of Troops
at Styx.
Columbia. June 24.?"I expect to
spend Sunday at Camp Moore," said
Gov. Manning, who came to Columbia
yesterday on business. Important bus?
iness prevented the governor from at?
tending the campaign meeting yester?
day at Walhalla. The governor left
Columbia at 1 o'clock for Anderson
and will speak at the campaign meet?
ing there today.
Gov. Manning said that he was
[highly pleased with the excellent re?
sponse of the South Carolina National
Guard, but that more men will be
needed to place the two reglrnenets on
a war footing. Gov. Manning is urg?
ing the staff officers to take every pre?
caution to insure the health of the
men at Camp Moore.
Gov. Manning again urged the busi?
ness men of the State to bold open the
positions of the men who have volun?
teered their services In the defense of
the United States. He is making this
appeal at every campaign meeting.
Gov. Manning continues as com
mander-in-chief of the South. Casejina
forces until they are mustered, into
the service of the United States.
"I expect to spend as much- time as
possible with the men at Styxf" said
the governor.
to Go Before Joint
at Noon;
s Reply to Ultimatum?
WJiether He Will Aak Fe r
Lie* Army to En
Causing Trouble.
Washington, June 86.?Unless Car
ransa compiles with the terms of the
ultimatum, President Wilson will
place the Mexican situation before a
joint session of congress to be held
Wednesday at noon. It has not yet
been decided whether the president
will ask for a declaration of war or
the passage of a resolution, stich as
was adopted at the time of the Vera
Cruz Incident, permitting him to util?
ize the armed forces of the United
States to enforce the decrees of the
State department.
Party leaders say that congress will
follow any plan the president suggests.
The administration expects a reply to
the demand for the release of the
American troops not later than to?
morrow. Indications now are that it
will be a flat refusal or an evasion.
Latin-American diplomats are
bringing strong pressure to bear on
Caranza to release the troopers and
avert war.
As indicating the belief of congres?
sional leaders here that Carranza will
not back down, conferences were be?
ing held today arranging the details
for the joint session of congress on
W>dnesday.
Advocates of a flat declaration of
war tell the president that In order
to enforce a rigid blockade of Mexican
ports a complete break with Mexico
must come. They say that interna?
tional law will not recognize a block?
ade unless war is declared, and de?
clare that a blockade is necessary to
bring Carranza to terms.
The offer of mediation by Latin
American nations Is troubling the
president. Bolivian Minister Caldo
ron has arranged for a conference
with Secretary Lansing this afternoon,
at which It is expected he will make
a formal offer from all Latin-Ameri?
can nations to mediate with Mexico.
Minister Calderon said: "Our plans
all depend on the attitude of the Uni?
ted States. We cannot determine yet
whether or not there is a chance that
our offer will prove successful."
President Wilron and his advisers
havo taken the position that the situ?
ation is not one for mediation, but
they plan to use the utmost delicacy,
however, In handling the Latln-Amer
lean proposals.
WAR SPIRIT RAMPANT.
Report From Mexico Says Many Mex?
icans Res|M>nd to Call for Volun?
teer*.
Mexico City, June 26.?Carranza
has wired Oen. Trevlno at Chihuahua
city to forward Immediately u full
account of the Carrlzal buttle. It Is
understood that this action was taken
as the result of President Wilson's
demand for the release of the Ameri?
can troopers held prisoners at Chi?
huahua. The war spirit Is rampant
and large numbers are responding to
the government's call for volunteers.
DEFIANT REPLY PREDICTED.
L El Paso. June 2?.?The principal
newspaper of El Paso, Del Norte, the
official mouthpiece of the, Carranza
government In Juarez, says that Car
ranza's reply to the American ultimat?
um will be no less defiant than Gen.
Trevino'8 threats to Gen. Pershlng.
ed that the prediction is true and
ed that the prediction is true and
that war is unavoidable. Another great
body of Mexican troops have been
sent from Chihuahua toward Villa
Ahmuada. The Juarez Garrison is re?
ported to be entrenching near the city
against the expected Invasion by
Americans.

Secretary of State Lawrtng, Saerellry
of War Baker, and President TOfaen.
The fojlovving program waaeUwnsid
ered In view of Gen. Pershing's re?
ports, showing that American troops
were ambushed at Carrlzal.
Carranza will be asked to say im?
mediately whether the attack at Car?
rlzal will be upheld by his government.
If the attack is not approved then
the chief Mexican officers must be se?
verely punished. Carranza must re?
ply in a brief time. If his reply is
unsatisfactory President Wilson will
go before congress asking that war
be declared against Mexico. Then
the entire army and navy will be used
to crush the Mexican military power
Immediatey. A practical embargo
goes in effect on the border at once,
preventing food supplies reaching the
Carranza army. All supplies except
for American concerns In Mexico hava
been held up. Many Mexican railway
cars have been seized.
. President Wilson demands that Car?
ranza release the seventeen cavalry?
men captured at Carrlzal lmmedlate
lly. The note making the demand
is on the way to Carranza. The ulti?
matum It is beii^t^^reielaae^
declaration of war unfess the men are
returned safely to the American
lines within twenty-four hours.
Administration leaders in congress
held a conference this morning and
Representative Hay announces that a
measure will be rushed through con?
gress providing twenty million dollars
to meet the expenses of moving the
militia and additional money if more
is needed. Six million dollars will
also be provided for the expense of
the past few weeks. Congressional
leaders say they expect President
Wilson will ask for early joint session
of congress so. that he can ask for a
declaration of war. The war spirit is
high here.
When Gen. Pershing's final report
of the Carrlzal fight Is received,
which Is expected to show that the
Americans were not at fault for the
clash, President Wilson Is expected to
wait no longer.
The Ecudoran government has tak?
en the lead In trying to arrange for
mediation. The effort will be made to
get all the Latin-American govern?
ments to ask President Wilson to ac?
cept the mediation plan. The Ecu?
doran minister has aranged a confer?
ence of all Latin-American diplomats
la near future when it will be decid?
ed whether to officially ask President
Wilson to mediate. The offer would
certainly be rejected as the adminis?
tration takes the stand that the mur?
der of Americans Is not subject to
mediation.
