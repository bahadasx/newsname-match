livery druggist in town?
your druggist and everybody's
druggist has noticed a gruul
fulling ell' in the sale of calomel.
They all give the sumo reason.
Hudson's Liver Tone is taking
its place.
"Citlouiel is dangerous und
I.pie know it, while Hudson's
l.is .-i lone is perfectly aufu und
gives better results," said a
prominent local druggist. Hod
son's Liver Tone is personally
guaranteed by every druggist
who stdls it. A lurge bottle
cost 5U cents, and if it fails to
give easy relief iu every cueo of
of liver sluggishness and con?
stipation, you have only to ask
tor your money hack.
Hudson's Liver Tone is a
pleasant-tasting, purely vege?
table remedy, harmless to both
children and adults. Take u
spoonful at night and wake up
feeling tine; no biliousness, sick
headache, acid stomach or eon
stipatetl bowtds. It dousu't
gripe or cause inconvenience
all the next tlay like violent
calomel. Take a dose of calo?
mel today and tomorrow you
will feel weak, sick and nuu
seated. Don't lose a day's
work! Take Hudson's Liver
Tone instead und feel Hue, full
of vigor and uiubition.?adv.
