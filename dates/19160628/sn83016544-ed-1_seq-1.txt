in this critical period of our national
history I recognize that it is your
right to summon and that it is my
paramount duty to respond.

mands for a dominant, thorough going
American with first protective upbuild­
ing policies essential to our peace and
security and to that call, in this
crisis, I cannot fail to answer with
the pledge of all that is in me to the

MEXICAN BIND RAIDS
AMERICAN RANCHES
Laredo, Tex., June 12.—Fifteen
Mexican bandits attacked four white
persons on the T. A. Coleman ranch at
San Samuel, droye them to the brush
and escaped across the Rio Grande
with eighty-three horses.
The same party of Mexicans, it is
reported, attacked the Johnson and
Coleman ranch in the same vicinity.
American soldiers were sent in mo­
tor trucks to follow the trail of the
bandits.
An unverified report says the horses
had been recovered, but whether any
fighting had taken place was not
known.
Two American cowboys, George
Conover and Arthur Myers, were cap­
tured and carried off in the raid on
the Johnson and Coleman ranch.
They were released later and reach­
ed Palofox, Tex., fifty miles west of
Laredo, unharmed.
Luis de la Rosa, a notorious bandit
leader, is said to have been with the
party which raided this ranch. The
Mexicans had rounded up a bunch of
horses when they were discovered by
Conover and Myers and a Mexican
employe of the ranch, who stampeded
the animals.
