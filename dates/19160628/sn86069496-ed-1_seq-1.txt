There was a balance of 89,000 due

at Campbellsville, last Sunday fore-,
noon. That amount had to be paid
before the dedicatory sermon. The
members and other persons wh'o Vere
in sympathy with the denomination,
in a very short time, subscribed eleven
thousand dollars. While Mr. Geo. H.
Gowdy abhors notoriety of any kind,
it is well enough for the public to
know that he contributed 87,5oo
to the building of this edifice,
though he is nob a member of the
Christian Church nor any .other church
His mother was an ardent member of
-ihisenomlnation, and naturally Mr
Gowdy is in sympathy with Jt.

Editor "News:
I see in this week's issue an article
that made me feel personated, hence
you will find enclosed ?1 for the News.
I can't do without ib at all, as I see so
much about my dear ones in my na
tive county, where I spent my happy
childhood days, and I never shall for
get how kind the people of Columbia
were to me and my dear brother 3
years ago, when his spirit took its
flight to. the far away land, and some
of them have gone to join him since.
I often think of cousin Bill Walker
as good a boy as ever lived, who re
cently passed over the river, and two
lone sisters, but the guardian angel
and the good people of Columbia watch
over them. I could mention so many
who have endeared themselves to me,
but time and space won't admit.
I will say something about our won
derful crop of strawberries that we
have just shipped from here 370 cars
400 crates to the car $2 per crate.
You see quite a sum of money came
into our county and town. There
have been a great many more planted
this spring, and will be twice as many
next year. We've had good rains and
crops are fine Wheat and oats are
short. Gardens are bountiful.
I will close hoping Adair and News
success and the railroad a go.
Yours,
W. T. Flowers.

A Message From Senator James.
At the close of the St, Louis con
vention ab which the Presidenb and
Vice-President were re-nominated by
acclamation, a fact without parallel
in American history and which has
but one interpretation, "Well done
thou good and faithful servants,"
Senator James sent the following
message back to Kentucky through
the delegation from this state.
"When you get home boys," said
Ollie M. James to a number of Ken.
tucky delegates, who had appeared to
congratulate him on his speech; the
great denomstation that was accorded
him and the manner in which he had
acquitted himself as the permanent
chairman of the convention, "Tell ev
ery democrat you meet to lay aside
his fational feelings, if he is unfortu
nate enough to have any, and to get
on his toes for Wilson and Marshall
and his democratic candidate for Con
gress and remain on his toes, showing
no quarter and holding every advan
tage legitimately gained until the
fight is ended in victory on November
7th." Cincinnati Enquirer June 18.
This message ought to be heeded es
pecially by the Senator's friends in
,this district, where a contest is pend
ing for the Congressional nomination
against a man who has consistently ab
all times endeavored to uphold the
hands of the Presidenb and which
contest is not calculated to increase
Kentucky's majority or Insure her
electoral vote for Wilson. Adv.
If you want a good price for your
mules bring them to Columoia next
Monday. Harry Lazarus and Co., will
be Tiere.
