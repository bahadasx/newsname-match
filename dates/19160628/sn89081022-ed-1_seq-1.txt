Thus run the first and last 6tanzas
of a poem written by C. K. Solberg
and read the first time at the Minne
apolis Tronderlags banquet, May 14,
1916. It speaks of love for the old
motherland where the cradle rocked,
and at the same time breathes deep
loyalty to America and its institutions,
the home by adoption.
The Tronders, Norwegian-Americans
whose native places or antecedents are
found in Trondhjem's province of Nor
way, held their 1916 re-union at Will
mar last Saturday and Sunday. It was
one of the most successful meetings
the organization has had since its in
ception at Fergus Falls in 1908
There were approximately six hundred
visitors here, and they had a good
time, and left the city well pleased
with the entertainment that had been
accorded them.
The re-union had less set programs
than previous similar conventions
which have met here. The order of
the meetings was arranged after the
arrival of the members and were
therefore more or less informal in
character. Like the Stavangerlaget
which met here last year, the Sunday
meetings orere distinctly religious in
nature.
Three soloists of note were here to
Intersperse music among the speeches,
viz: C. Ferdinand Barene, Tenor of
Yankton Prof. John Dobdal, violinist
of Chicago and Miss Bertha Ask, pi
anlste of Minneapolis. Normaendenes
Sangforening of Willmar, the leader
of which, Olof Sundt, is himself an en
thusiastic Tronder, contributed selec
tions for the occasion which were
greatly appreciated. Sunday after
noon the Citizens' Military Band of
Willmar, gave a splendid open air con
cert at the auditorium park for the
benefit of the visitors.
The first session opened Saturday
afternoon at three o'clock, when the
president, Consul S. O. Hanger, of
Yankton, S. D., opened the meetings
The members marched in procession
from the headquarters at the Commer
cial Club rooms to the Willmar Semi
nary, where Saturday's sessions were
held The silk banner was carried by
Mr Fredrik Kavli of Minneapolis. The
business session was held when the
annual reports were heard and officers
elected. Consul Hanger was re-elect
ed president, and as secretary-treasur
er, Prof I. Dorrum of Fergus Falls was
re-elected.
Among other directors and officers
elected, Mr. Slvert S. Olarum of Will
mar was honored by the selection as
one of the vice presidents. Tronder
laget issues a handsomely printed year
book, which will contain the reports
and illustrated articles.
Saturday evening's session was an
enjoyable one, a number of speeches
being interspersed by selections of the
soloists.
Sunday morning regular services
were held at the Park Auditorium and
were conducted by Rev. J. N. Ander
sen of the local Synod church and
Rev. E. Ristad of Fergus Falls
There were no forenoon services in
the Lutheran churches of the city and
a very large crowd was in attendance
at the park. Rev. Ristad preached
over the text of the day, (The Rich
Man and Lazarus), and made a most
powerful and impressive discourse
Misses Sophia Tallakson and Evelyn
Grindeland sang two duets at the ser
vices.
In the afternoon there was a concert
on the grounds by the Citizens' Mili
tary Band. As the rain approached
the crowd went into the auditorium
whese a impromptu program was car
ried out. Rev. D. C. Jordahl of Ridge
way, la., spoke of old memories from
his boyhood days In the land of the
Midnight Sun.
Rev. E. E. Gyndld of Willmar was the
next speaker called on and he spoke
of the traits of the Tronders. The
chairman also called on a gentleman
from North Dakota and on Secretary
Dorrum for short talks.
The evening was devoted to a musi
cal program in which Prof. Dopdal,
the violinist, Miss1 Bertha Ask, pian
lste and C. Ferdinand Barene, tenor
took part There were short speeches
by Mayor Wellln and Hon. L. O.
Thorpe.

KAREN GLESNE.
Karen Glesne, wife of Even O. Gles
ne, after a sickness1 of about six weeks,
fell asleep at 4:30 o'clock yesterday
afternoon, June 22nd. Her death was
not unexpected, as she had been un
able to partake of any nourishment
for some time. The patience and good
nature which always was a strong
trait in her character never were more
pronounced than during her last days.
Mrs. Glesne was born in Halllng
dahl, Norway, October 27, 1839. She
came to America while a child, and,
losing her mother at an early age, was
taken care of by kind neighbors. When
twenty-two years of age she was unit
ed in the holy bonds of matrimony
with Even O. Glesne, who lives to
mourn her departure. Coming to this
part of the state from her early home
in Green county, Wis the Glesnes
found much to contend with. Being
amongst the early settlers of Norway
Lake, they found their courage often
taxed by great difficulties. Through
dangers of Indian attacks and the aw
ful seasons of the Minnesota weather
of the sixties and seventies, they
strove together, working faithfully to
gain a living and to bring up their
children in the way they should go.
How well they have succeeded, the
citizens of this locality well know. At
all times, in time of adversity as well
as In time to prosperity, the Glesne
home was a haven of rest for whoever
might seek refuge there, and no one
was ever turned away from their door
asi long as they had something to
share.
To bless their life together there
have been born twelve children, six
sons and six daughters. Together they
have suffered the loss of four sons and
two daughters. There are then, liv
ing, two sons and four daughters, who
have been blessed in being brought
up by a mother who set an example
of industry and practical Christianity
which was worth more than one can
measure. The children who live to
mourn her departure are Mrs. Ole
Stevens, Forada, Minn. Mrs. (Rev.)
J. Halvorson, Rockdale, Wis. Ole
Glesne, Belgrade, Minn. Mrs. M. F.
Lundqulst, New London, Minn. Ed
ward Glesne and Geoline Glesne, Nor
way Lake. Twenty-seven grandchild
ren and seven great grandchildren
trace their ancestry back to Mrs. Gles
ne. A great circle of friends join with
the husband and children in mourn
ing the loss of one who has been an
Inspiration to many and a credit to
the community.
Mrs. Glesne will be burled next
Monday, services being held at the
house at about ten thirty a. m., and at
the church at about one-thirty. Rev.
Sotendahl will ofllclate.—Sunburg En

Roller Skating Rink.
The roller skating craze has hit
many inhabitants of this city, and the
roller rink which opened for business
on the Rodlun lots on the corner of
Fourth street and Trott Ave. is doing
a big business each afternoon and eve
ning. The place is conducted in a
thoroly respectable manner, with a
floor manager always on hand. Pri
vate lessons in this difficult, but pop
ular sport will also be given those
wishing them.
