bandits who early today raided
tlie double adolie raneli about 3"i
miles southwest of llaehita.
N. M., killinjr William Packer, a
ranehniaii. and Mrs. Alice Packer,
his bride of five months.
P.eeause of the isolation of the
district no report had reached
Colonel H. Sickle, command
ing the border patrol here, at a
late hour tonight, but it was as
sumed that the raiders had
crossed the frontier perhaps with
the pursuers close behind.
Bandits Mexicans.
According to stories reaching
here, the bandits are believed to
have been Mexicans who recently
have committed numerous minor
depredations in the district. They
are supposed to have crossed the
frontier on a stock stealing foray.
Packer, from whom Mexican ban
dits stole a number of head of
stock last week, attempted to
drive them off, but was forced
to retreat to the ranchhous". The
marauders followed him, broke
through the door and murdered
Packer und his young wife. They
are said to have made their way
south, driving several head of cat
tle and horses before them.
rmmediately after the news of
the raid become known citizens
of llaehita and other communi
ties in the neighborhood formed
posses anil mot.'i.d to the ranch
to take up the, trail of the ban
dits. Shortly afterward cavalry
detachments were ordered from
lias Cinegas, Alamo, Ilueeo and
other outposts.

with the receipt of news of a new

llaehita. N. M., resulting In the mil der
of William l'lii-ker, an American
ranchman, and his wifo.
Coming on the heels of Cat rlzal and
the hostile attitude recently manifest

civil populace and the troops of the
da facto Kovernment, the new raid
'ouh'm! widespread rpceu titlnn. Tin
federal sentiment seems to ho that
he Incident demonstrate J iiiipw the
'Inability of the Carr.in.a government
to offer any protection to the Ameri
can frontier and would serve to bring
matters to a head quickly.
Military authorities here tonigh
doubted ihat the maraudeev. who arc
believed to have been members of i.
band of stock thieves known to have

that General Jacinto Trevino, com

the disposition of his troops In prep

the strength of which H variously
estimated from twenty-five thVusand
