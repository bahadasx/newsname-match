HOLT FARMER
MURDERED BYSON
Jdhn Hanson Shot by Son While
Cleaning AutomobileBody
Hid Behind Granary.
Louis Hanson, aged 26, shot and
Tailed his father, John Hanson, Mon
day evening while the later was in
the act of cleaning his automobile
in the farm yard. After having
comleted the shooting. Louis took
the body and hid it in the grass be
hind the granary. The weapon used
by the young Hanson was an old 22
rifle and was hid under the granary
floor after the murder. The empty
cartridges were hid near a post in
the pasture fence.
The murder took place about five
o'clock in the afternoon, while
George Hanson, another son was
working in the field. Upon return
ing from the day's work, George
asked his brother were the father
was The reply was that the "old
man is behind the granary". Not
thinking anything more about the
matter George went about the work
of doing the farm chores, while
Louis went after the cattle. In the
meanwhile a neighbor boy called
upon the young men and as he was
about to leave, Louis ealled him
back and said to him: "I want to
show you something funny". The
boy asked whs.t i* wan an-l Louis
told "him to go with him behind the
granary. At first the neighbor did
not see anything and asked Louis
again what it was. Louis then
pointed to his father, who was lay
ing huddled in the deep grass. Im
mediately upon seeing the dead man
the visiting boy ran and informed
the other brother George, who noti
fied the authorities in this city.
Sheiiff Hanson left yesterday for
Holt and brought the demented
young man to this city for exam
ination for insanity.
3"he bullet entered the dead man's
head from his neck and bored its
way thru to the forehead. This
evidence showed that the father
must have been in a stooped posi
tion while shot.
The deceased was a properous
farmer, who was well known in his
neighborhood and resided about
eigh miles north of Hdlt.
The boy, Louis, has been insane
for several years, but had never
shown signs of being dangerous un
til recently and does not realize
that he has killed his father, but
as he says "it is something funny."

WARREN
CITY AND VICINITY
VISITED BY HIGH WIND.
A high wind of no small propor
tion blew over this section of the
state, Thursday morning at about
nine o'clock and did a considerable
amount of damage. The wind des
troyed hundreds of trees and also
razed several small buildings on the
neighboring farms. At the fair
grounds in this city a great deal of
damage was done. The roof of the
large grand stand was lifted off and
was landed a distance of about a
hundred yards from its former lo
cation. The grand stand proper was
moved off its foundation a little over
a foot. A section of the stock barn
was also blown over. The roof was
blown off the large horse barn be
linging to the C. L. Spaulding farm.
At the Snake River farm, owned by
Andrew Melgard, the wind wrought
havoc with the buildings. With the
exception of two or three structures
on the farm all the rest were dam
aged to some extent by being moved
off their foundations.
In and around Grookston consid
erable more damage was done. The
elevator at Shirley was blown over
and totally destroyed. Many silos
and outbuildings were destroyed and
the damage in the immediate vicinity
of Crookston is estimated at $35,000.
COMPANY I OF CROOKSTON
LEAVES FOR TRAINING CAMP.
While at Crookston Sunday even
ing the writer witnessed the depart
ure of Company I, of the Grookston
militia, for Fort Snelling, where th-\v
will be trained prior to leaving for
Mexico. The parade of the boys thru
the principal streets headed by the
Crookston band was a very impress
ing sight, that one will not readily
forget. The citizens of Crookston
and the relatives of the members of
the militia were at the station en
masse and gave them a rousing
send off. It is estimated that the
crowd at the station exceeded three
thousand people.
Died at a Ripe Old Age.
John Mortenson, a well known
pioneer resident of this city, died
at 7:30 o'clock, on Monday morning,
June 26th, 1916, at the ripe old age
of 79 years 2 months and 25 days.
Deceased was born in Medaker,
Westmanland, Sweden, March 31,
1837. He was married to Anna
Selin, in 1874. He immigrated to
America and came to Marshall coun
ty in 1881, settling on a farm in
town of McCrea, where he was en
gaged in farming until 1891. Then
they sold the farm and moved into
Warren, where they engaged in the
hotel business for a number of
years. Mrs. Mortenson died in Feb
ruary 1909.
In 1910, Mr. Mortenson and his
only daughter and child, Miss
Martha Mortenson, made a trip to
Sweden to visit two brothers and
three sisters of deceased, who are
still living there. Returning from
Sweden they continued to make
their home in Warren. Miss Mor
tenson, who is a graduate of the
Warren High School and the Moor
head normal school and is a teacher
by profession, tenderly caring for
her father during his declining
years.
John Mortenson was a very kind
and pleasant old gentleman, courte
ous to everybody, always tipping his
hat to persons he met on the street,
in accordance with old country style.
He was a friend to everybody and
everybody was his friend.
The funeral was held from the
Swedish Lutheran church in this
city, this afternoon at 2 oclock and
was conducted by Rev. J. W. Lund
gren, of Alvarado, who preached an
impressive funeral sermon. An ap
propriate solo was sang by Nels E.
Bystrom. In ,spite of the rain there
was a good sized attendance of old
friends and neighbors of deceased.
The floral contributions were many
and beautiful, one or two set pieces
being contributed by friends in the,
village of Alvarado, 'where Miss
Mortenson has taught school for a
number of velars.
Peace to the memory of a good
man and noble pioneer. 4wv*.\s^
WARREN, MARSHALL COUNTY, MINNESOTA,
"THE BIRTH OF A NATION."
At the Warren Opera House, 3 Days,
Starting Monday, July 3rd.
Horrors of the 'Reconstruction' in
The Birth of a Nation.
The period of the 'reconstruction',
so vivedly brought back to the mem
ory of those who may have gone
through it and reproduced afresh for
those newer generations who now
view it for the first time, in Grif
fith's Birth of a Nation, shows the
time of Johnson's administration
and he, as the nation's executive, in
the hands of a ring of politicians
and power seekers, who are manip
ulating the affairs of the South to
suit their own ends. It turns to the
ruins of the flower decked South
Carolina village of ante bellum days,
the place where the blacks were
light hearted and care free, even
under the bonds of slaveryturns
back to the town that by war has
been left half in ruina, the streets
grass grown, the stately mansions
of the old days tottering and
crumbling to a town where those
once wealthy now are in direct pov
ertywhere the "black is as good
as a white man", as was the slogan
of the northern men of the Lynch
and Stoneman type.
Women are menaced by the black
minions of the northern whites, or
are attacked, whites are driven from
the streets, menaced by the colored
troops, or assaulted. Homes are in
vaded. Justice is a forgotten thing.
The land knows no law but that con
ceived by the race then in control.
Thenthe chivalry of the whites is
given new life. The Ku Klux Klan
is formed. These riders of the
night, in ghostly white, rally by
dozens, by scores, and hundreds of
thousands. They ride like the wind.
They strike without even the warn
ing the rattlesnake gives, but are far
more deadly.
This all, wonderful, soul stirring,
breath-taking as it is, is but another
of the innumerable 'dramas within
dramas' of which The Birth of a
Nation consists.
This glorious spectacle is to be
given here in its entirety, with its
accompanying symphony orchestra,
4$sV effect paraphernalia and its
trained mechanicians for that purpose
and is to be put on here in the
same fashion down to the smallest
Retail that amazed New York and
-the other cities.

JOHN CHENEY HAS
PASSED AWAY.
Well Known Foreman at the
Farm, Died Last Satur-
day.
Again the ranks of the old set
lers has been depleted, this time by
the -death of John Cheney, the well
known foreman on the March farm,
who passed from the land of the liv
ing, in this city, on June 24, 1916,
at 6:35 A. M., aged 60 years 6
months and 16 days. The cause of
death was cancer of the stomach
from which disease he had been a
sufferer since early last winter.
John Cheney was born Dec. 8,
1855, at Akron, N. Y. His parents
were Dudley Cheney and Christie
Ann Cheney. He was married in
1880 at Litchfield, Minn., to Hannah
Stanlon, the wife who now survives
him and mourns the loss of her life
companion. To this union was born
two sons, Dudley and George
Cheney, and one daughter, Miss Ann
Cheney, all living here and an honor
to the parents and to the commun
ity. Deceased is also mourned by
three brothers, Charles, Frank and
George, and two sisters, Clara and
Anna, all living in the east except
Charles Cheney, who resides in this
county. Brother George Cheney ar
rived from Akron, N. Y., to attend
the funeral.
John Cheney came to Marshall
county about 32 years ago. His
knowledge of farming and ability to
handle men made his services on
'demand on the big farms then open
ing up. He was employed as fore
man on the March Farm for some
25 years, holding that position at
his death, and he also held a similai
position on the Woodward farm for
a number of years. He was kind
aftd considerate in dealing with
workmen, mingled with them as one
of their number, and was in return
highly respected and beloved by all
men under his charge. No finer
tribute could be paid him than was
done by the laborers on the farm,
who in a body attended the funeral
and with tear filled eyes followed
the coffin to the grave. As a pro
gressive farmer, a useful and es
teemed citizen and a good neighbor
and friend John Cheney held an ex
alted place. By his death the
community has sustained a great
loss.
The funeral was held at the M.
E. church in this city on Monday af
ternoon at two o'clock and was
largely attended by old settlers and
neighbors who came to pay their last
tribute of respect and love to the
departed pioneer, who had finished
his work on earth. The funeral was
under the auspicies of the Warren
Masonic Lodge, of which the de
ceased was a member. He was also
a member of the M. E. church here.
Appropriate music was rendered by
the'choir and an impressive sermon
was preached by Rev. L. W. Bar
tholow. The floral tributes were
many and beautiful, and were con
tributed by employees, employers,
lodges and friends. S. A. March
Jr., of Minneapolis, C. L. Spaulding,
of this city, John Birkholz, of Grand
Forks, Mr. Holmes, manager, past
and present owners of the farm, were
in attendance at the funeral. At
the grave the beautiful masonic
funeral service was gracefully and
eloquently conducted by W. N. Pow
ell. The sturdy pioneer was laid at
rest. Long live his meuory.
To all who mourn, this community
extends most heartfelt sympathy.

WARREN WINS
FROM FERGUS
Fans, Band and Ball Team Journey
to Ada Sunday.Tie First
and Win Second.
Sunday was and will be an event
full day in the memory of the lovers
of the national game in this city.
On this day at ten o'clock, the fans
with their wives, femine rooters and
the Warren band left by special train,
for Ada, where the local nine met the
strong aggregation of ball players
from Fergus Falls in two splendid
exhibitions of the national past time.
Fergus Falls had sent a strong dele
gation of fans with their band to ac
company their team also, so during
the day one could listen to excellent
music at every hour.
The first game was played in a
drizzling rain on a grass diamond
and as the twirlers could not put the
iu S-+JC
curves on the spheres, there
was a good deal of heavy hitting
done which resulted in big score
for the two nines. The game proved
to be a hard fought battle and result
ed in a tie score of 10 and 10 ir tae
ninth frame. Foster threw during
the first four innings, but with a wet
ball was not able to do muc.i and was
relieved in the fifth by Haibenc. who
managed to hold the opposing 'oats
man down in the remainder of the
game.^ Cline as catcher and WT,ng
field first also exchanged pos.iti.jns
at this period of the game.

The second game was a moi'e in
teresting affair and was played under
a clear sky. This contest went only
five innings as the managers of the
two teams had decided to compl/
with the state Sunday base ball law
and called the game at 6 o'clock.
Deleburn threw for Warren in this
game and had the Fergus Falls bat
ters mystified by his curves. Wahl
strom was on the mound for Fergus
Falls. The resulting score was 1
to 0 in favor of Warren.
