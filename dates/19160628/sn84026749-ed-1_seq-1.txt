CASEMENT ON
STAND, DENIES
GERMAN PLOT
Imprisoned Peer Declares Irish
Rebellion Was Not Inspired
in Central Empires.
SAYS HE GOT NO MONEY
Alto Asserts He Did Not Ask
Prisoners to Fight With Ger
mans and Turks.
LONDON, June 28. Taking the
witness box in his own defense in
his trial on the charge of treason,
Sir Roger Casement this afternoon
i denied that the Irish rebellion was
' in any way inspired in Germany.
Casement made a formal state
ment'to the jury. He denied that
he had received any money from
Germany.
"The charge that the Irish re--.bellion
wirftftplred in Germany is
untrue," he said. "It was neither
made nor directed by Germans."
Sir Roger was presented as a wit
ness after the presiding justices
had overruled a motion to quash
the indictment against him on tech
nical grounds. He spoke earnest
ly, but with a slight show of nerv
ousness. "ABOMINABLE FALSEHOODS."
Casement denied he asked Irish pris
oners In German prison camps to fight
with the Turks and Germans.
He was not responsible, he said, for
the reduction of rations and other pun
ishment inflicted upon Irish soldiers who
refuged to Join the brigades he was
organising, declaring; such allegations
to be "abominable falsehoods."
His denial that ho had ever reoelved
German money was most emphatic.
"Those who know me know that I
never sold myself to any man or any
government," he declared.
"I wish to refute this slander because
so often money was offered me In lib
eral sums and I refused," added Case
ment "I left Germany poorer than I
entered."
, Couldn't Refuse Knighthood.
In his opening statement, Attorney
General Smith hod denounced Casement
for accepting knighthood and a pension
at the hands of the British government
and then playing Into the hands of
Britain's enemlss.
Casement replied that It was not In
his power to refuse the offer of knight
hood and that he accepted the pension
because he had earned It through gov
ernment service.
The attorney general had made a
vague allegation to his connection with
the uprising In Ireland, he said, but had
produced no evidence to uphold his
statement.

THINKS
IS "INCONCEIVABLE"
Argentine Ambassador Still
Hopes Clash With Mexico
Will Be Avoided.
NEW YORK. June . Hope for a
peaceful settlement of the controversy
between tho United 8tates and Mexico
In the Interests of Pan-Amerlcanlsm was
expressed today by Dr. Romulo S. Noon,
Argentine ambassador to Washington.
Dr. Naon Issued a statement denying
that he had made formal offers of
mediation on behalf of his government,
but expressing the belief that war will
yet be avoided. His statement follows:
"I hove mado no offer, but It Is un
necessary to say that the Argentine
government Is always disposed to work
for the peace of America.
"Pan-Amerlcanlsm, which Is vital for
all the countries of the continent,
whether great or small, strong or weak,
makes war between two American na
tions utterly Inconceivable. I am. In
candor, confident that the present crisis
will be peacefully settled. We must
make evident that no matter how great
the differences between two American
governments, tho continental Interests
of union and concord are supreme and
Inconsistent with recourse to violence
as a means of settling International dis
putes In America.
"The Argentine people and govern
ment are following this conflict with the
deepest concern and notwithstanding the
acuteness of the crisis trust that the In
spiration of a sound, far-sighted po
litical sense will prevail In these hours
so full of peril for the destinies of tho
continent."

ranza has sent another urgent appeal to
all Latin-American republics asking that
they to Insist that the United States
accept mediation, It was reported on
good authority today, though no official
announcement was made.
Tho appeal was sent after Constitu
tionalist officials had scanned American
newspapers carrying sensational reports
regarding border conditions.
Several officials said that in view of
the Democratio platform declarations
regarding Mexico and Pan-Amerlcanlsm
and his previous st and against tho In
terventionists, President Wilson will bo
compelled to accept mediation If It Is
formality proffered.
The foreign office was surprised to
learn today that certain American news
papers recently carried a report that
Carranxa had sent an ultimatum to
Washington, giving the American troops
soven days In which to withdraw, with
the alternative a declaration of war.
The newspapers added that a special
agent left here on Jun 19 with such a
mssage.

After announcing that the meetings

Dr. Jordan said the meetings might bo !
transferred to Pan Antonio, where tho
samo reason could not actuate tho

Addressing the University Club, Dr.
Jordan said:
"I am opposed to Mexican Interven

United States seems not to have been
able to see any way out. and I don't
see any other way. Wo could see a way

"If we Intervene It should bo for

He denied that he said "that tho anni

Justify Intervention."
Many think there will be no peaco

W. J. Bryan declined to attend an a

of Frank P. Walsh, of Kansas City,
based on a telegram from the Secretary
