Henry Carter Stuart last nifc-ht. LMSl
unlisted men and more than fifty of
ficers blew their candles out and
shuffled in the darkness to their cots
There was no sound then save that
coming from the patient sentry on his
beat and an occasional call to the cor
poral of the guard. In the sternest
sense, it is now a military encamp
ment. Officers and men sleep with
their arms near them. The commis
sary wagon train is ready to move to
the freight cars standing dly In the
yards of the Richmond, Fredericksburg
and Potomac Railroad. All is in readi
ness for the final call. Adjutant
General W. W. Sale can move two regi
ments. the Signal Corps and the Hos
pital Corps upon the morrow, if word
comes from the War Department.
Definite orders as to the time of
movement of the Virginia troops had
not been received by the Adjutant
General yesterday, but he has been
asked to have his organizations ready
to move upon a moment's notice. It is
understood at the office of the Ad
jutant-General that the Virginia sol
diers will be placed at El Paso. Tex.,
which lies just this side of the .Mexican
border, where turbulence and anxiety
have seethed since the first threat of
hostilities. Here the militiamen, if the
final summons comes, will be put
through camp routine until they are
fit for the field.
LIFE AT CAM I* STUART
NOT I'LAVlXC AT WAR
So the soldier who sleeps in Camp
Henry Carter Stuart dreams of that
southern border upon which soon ho
may pace through long hours of vigil,
of the charges he may make upon the
intrenched "greasers," and of the
hand-to-hand combat he may engage in
with some sallo / Mexican behind a
cactus. But from his dreams he
..wakens to a day's hard routine, to
policing the camp, to trench digging
and to the never-ending drilling. The
p lory of hie dreams fades with the
(.-lory of the. morning sun.
Every company in the State that has
been railed out, except the First Squad
jor.?The Richmond Blues ? end the
Howitzers, arrived in camp yesterday.
Ily 6 o'clock in tho afternoon the mi
litiamen from tho far Southwest had
criven their pins and pitched their
tentF-. Guard mount took place at 5
o'clock, and l.OftO citizens remained to
watch the guard go on duty. Guard
mount is one. of the most impressive
ceremonies in military life. It is tho
. r.rl o? the soldier's day. and until he
hears the mournful sounding of the last
bugle call the time is all his own
Keveille awakens him in the morning.
.,nd, after a dash of water in his face,
and a hasty buttoning of his uniform,
he proceeds to police tho camp, and
the day is well begun.

to drive them off, hut was forced to j

EXCITEMENT RENEWED
IIV CRIME OP I1ANDITS
i EL PASO, TEX., June 27. ? Excite
ment here over the Mexican controversy
was renewed to-night with the receipt
of news of a new bandit raid across the
border near Hachita. N' M.. resulting in
the murder of William M. Parker, an
j American ranchman, and his w ife.
The general sentiment seemed to be
'that the Incident demonstrated anew
j the inability of the Carranza govern
? ment to offer any protection 'o the
! American frontier and would serve to
bring matters to a head quickly.
: Military authorities here to-night
'doubted that the marauders, who are
! believed to have been mere stock
| thieves, known to have a lair in the
j fastness of the Sierra Madres, south of
i the New Mexico border, could he taken j
i before crossing to Mexico.
OFFICERS DO VOT KNOW
IF HOItDER IJ> CROSSED1
Officers of the American border pa-,
tro! had been unable to learn to-night
whether any of the cavalry detach-,
ments ordered in pursuit had crossed!
i t'ne border The conviction was ex-,
pressed, however, that if the troops
had discovered the raiders' trail, they
followed them Into Mexican territory.
: It is not believed that they would en
counter any Carranzist i troops, reports
here indlc*/inff that the larger Mcxi-j

Mexican report.' to-night Indicated
that General Trevino. commanding the
, Carranza army corps of tho north, prac
tlealiv has completed th-^ disposition of
his Troops in preparation for possible
hostilities with the United State.
The command. the strength of which
is estimated at from '<>!?:? to 4r?.rton
men. hay been distributed alone" the
;v .?? railroads to chihuahua, the Mexi
can Central and the Mexican North
western and in the Santa Maria River
Valley in such a way as to menace the
American line of communication and
present an obstacle to a possible Ameri
can drive toward Chihuahua City.
TllOOrS AlVK COMUXTKATKU
AT STRATEGIC POINTS
For more than weftk troops have
been concentrated in force at strategic
points north of Chihuahua City, along
the line of the Mexican Central, run
ning directly south from Juarez. Prep
arations to oppose any American at
tempt to use the Mexican Northwestern
Railroad, which extends in a sweeping
semicircle, the arc of which bends to
the west of Juarez, through Casas
Orandes. Madera and Santa Vsabel to
Chihuahua City, also have been made
by the stationing of large forces at
Kuslillos and Guzman. At each place
several thousand men are said to he
encamped, the palpable object at Guz
man, about tlve miles southwest of here,
being to block any effort to use the
road to transport supplies from the
border U.o General Pershing's cqlumn
and that at Bustillos, seventy miles
west of Chihuahua City, to prevent
General Pershing dispatching troops
bv rail to take the state capital.
Several thousand soldiers, including
some artillery, are said to be
bivouacked in the hills about the Santa
Clara Canyon, about twenty miles east
j of Namlqnipa. their guns commanding
the canyon through which passes the
j wagon road south toward Chihuahua
from General Pershing's chain of bases.
iI'EltSHINO IIAS (iATHKItKI)
FLEET OF MOTOR TKl'CKS
To offset these maneuvers General
[Pershing has gathered at Colonia Dub
Ian more than 200 motor trucks, with
which, in an emergency, he can trans
port infantry rapidly. The line of com
munication has been shortened, the
southern base being at K1 Valle, about
200 miles south of the border. Mexi
cans traveling over the motor-truck
trail in the zone occupied by the Ameri
cans are subjected to the most rigid
examinations, and the American fleet
of aeroplanes recently sent south from
the base are making daily reconnois
sance flights.
The Mexican de facto government
still has hopes, however, that the prob
lem will be solved by the withdrawal
of the American forces from Mexico,
according to a telegram received to
day at the local consulate from Mexico
City. It pointed out that a "very fa
vorable Impression" had been produced
)>y General Trevlno's report of the
withdrawal of the punitive forces from
Rachlnova and San Geronimo. and
added that the conclusion generally
drawn from General Tre.vino's report
was that the Americans acted under
orders to set urn to the border tor
patrol dut,\ in their own terrltorv
"It is the opinion h?.*?." the dispatch
continue?., 'that had proper vigilance
been use.-l and warning heeded, bandit'
raids could have been minimized or
altogether prevented."

Reports from General Pershing's
columns and from the forces along thb
border all had to do with the routine
of a big army, and carried no news of
clashes with Mexicans, either bandits
or troops of the do facto government.
Unless made necessary by some un
mistakable act of Carranzn's troops
the American army will take no hostile
steps towards Mexico until directed by
the War Department. Army officers
were eager for news from Washington
and Mexico City tint would determine
the character of the army's action.
Their own reports told of continued
concentration of Mexican forces with
in striking distance of the border, but
there appeared no Indication that Car
ranza was planning anything but a
defensive movement. The strongest,
garrison Carranza still has is that at
Ragle Pass, although a few men wera
? still held at other points.

as to Mexico was foreshadowed to-day
by the calm which prevailed in both
houses. Although measures designed to
prepare for war were under consldera
i tion and the corridors of the Capitol
hummed with rumors, there was no ex

on the floor was avoided. The legisla
