LAREDO, June 28.—American refugees from
Monterey brought here today a rumor that Japanese
officers are at the head of troops of Mexicans en route
from Monterey to Chihuahua to reinforce the Carranza
garrison there. The rumor, unconfirmed from any other
source, also said Japanese experts are directing work of
manufacturing munitions at the Monterey arsenal, which
lias been taken over by the Mexican government.
SAY U. S. PRISONERS EXECUTED
EAGLE PASS, Tex., June 28.—Unconfirmed but
persistent rumors from Mexican sources that the Ameri
can soldiers held as prisoners in Chihuahua City had
been executed, have aroused intense feeling here. The
reports which are being circulated in Piedras Negras,
across the river, say the Americans were shot to death
in prison at 11 o'clock Tuesday morning.
MEXICO CITY, June 28 (10 a. m.).—A confer
ence regarding President Wilson's demands for release
of soldiers at Chihuahua is now in progress. It is be
lieved a decision will be reached within a few hours.
Expect Reply Today
WASHINGTON, June 28.—The state department *
expects Carranza's reply by early afternoon. It is said
this belief is based on a telegram from Consul Rogers,
which reached the state department last night.
Funston Ready to Attack
SAN ANTONIO, June 28.—Preparations for distributing
and maintaining the militia are being made all along the
border today.
Funston and his staff are believed to be arranging the
troops so a sweeping movement could be started from several
points simultaneously in case invasion is ordered, and at the
same time leave adequate protection for the border.
There is a strict censorship on all news of troop move
ment. Even the railroads of the state have adopted the
policy of divulging no movements over their lines.
Small detachments of Eastern guardsmen are known
to have reached Texas but their destination is not known.
Concentration of Carranza troops opposite Naco is be- i
lieved to be a source of apprehension to army officers today.
The Mexican forces are said to be in much larger numbers
than at first reported and advices say there are 6.000.
A Carranza army ten times that size is reported at
Cananea. 90 miles south of Naco. The American forces are
understood to be fully prepared for an attack on Naco or
Bisbee.

Carranza's army today.
Reports from Interior Mexico de
clare the Chihuahua soldiers of the
de facto government have been told
by the officers that as soon as they
reach El l'aso they will have plenty
of food.
Several prominent mining men
arrived in El l'aso from Parral,
after narrowly escaping being
mobbed at Santa Rosalia and again
at Chihuahua.
They reported seeing Mexican
troop movements northward, esti
mating that 10,000 Mexicans were
en route to Chihuahua from south
ern points. This would bring the
total strength of the de facto gov
eminent In the state to over 65,000
men.
