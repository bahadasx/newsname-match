CARRIZAIJATTAGK
U. S. Demands Release of
Prisoners.
NOTE NEARLY IN ULTIMAT

is Intimation Behind
. Words.
SITUATION XOW VERY ACUTE
Washington, Juno 2G, A demand
for th"e immediate release of the
American troopers taken prisoners
at Carrizal, coupled with a stern
notification that the United States
expects an early statement of the
purposes of the Carranza Govern
ment, was telegraphed to Mexico
City to-day by Secretary Lansing.
The note discloses that the State
Department received yesterday a
communication from the de facto
Government stating that the Car
rizal fight was the direct result of
orders to attack American soldiers
-moving otherwise than toward the
border, personally"" issued by Gen.
Carranza to Gen. Trevlno, and by
the latter communicated to Gen.
Pershing.
The full text of the note to the
Mexican de facto government, trans
mitted to-day to James Linn Rodg
ers, special . representative of the
American Government in Mexico
City, says:
"Mr. Arredondo yesterday de
livered to this Government the fol
lowing communication:
" 'I am directed by my Govern
ment to inform Your Excellency,
wlfh reference to the Carrizal In
cldeatly, Jip, Chief t Executive,
through the Mexican War Depart
ment, gave orders to Gen. Jacinto B.
Trevlno not to permit American
forces from Gen. Pershing's column
to advance further South, from the
points where they are located, and
to oppose new incursions of Ameri
can soldiers into Mexican territory.
These orders were brought by Gen.
Trevlno to the attention of Gen.
Polling, who acknowledged the
receipt of the communication rel
ative thereto. On the 22d in
stant, as Your Excellency knows, an
American force moved eastward
quite far from its base, notwith
standing the above orders, and was
engaged by Mexican troops at Car
rizal, State of Chihuahua. As a
result of the encounter several
soldiers made prisoners."
"You are hereby instructed to
hand to the Minister of Foreign Re
lations of the de facto government
of Mexico the following:
" 'The Government af the United
"States can put no other construc
tion upon the communication handed
to the Secretary of State of the
"United States on the 24th of June,
by Mr. Arredondo, under instruc
tions of your government, than it Is
intended as a formal avowal of de
liberately hostile action against the
forces of the United States now In
Mexico and of the purpose to attack
them without provocation whenever
they move from their present posi
tion in pursuance of the objects for
which they were sent there, not
withstanding the fact those objects
not only involve no unrrlendly in
tentions toward the government
and people of Mexico, but are, on the
contrary, Intended only to assist that
government In protecting Itself and
the territory and people of the
United States against Irresponsible
and Insurgent bands of rebel ma
rauders. " 'I am Instructed, therefore, by
my Governn'ient to demand the im
mediate release of the prisoners
taken In the encounter at Carrizal,
iogether with any property of the
United States taken with them, and
to Inform you that the Government
of the United States expects an early
augment from your government as
to the course of action It wishes the
Government of the United States to
undesrtand it has determined upon,
and flhat It also expects that this
statement be made through the usual
diplomatic channels and not through
subordinate military commanders.' "
The President told those at the
conference, to-night of the note from
Gen. Carranza avowing the attack
on American troops at Carrizal, and
ofthe reply that he had directed to
be sent. Senator Stone was very em
phatic afterward in regard to the de
mand for release of tho prisoners.
"We must have those men," he
said, solemnly.
Tho Senator made no effort to
hide ills own belief that war virtual
ly Is here. A final report from Gen.
Pershing was necessary, he said In
order to get n clearer knowledge of
what has happened at Carrizal
should be nt hand.
"But If they are going to nttnek
our men without cause," he said,
"there is only one thing to do'. Wo
will never have peace down there
until we use force enough to com
pel It."

U. S. OFFICERS FELL IX ACTION
Field Headquarters, June 24 (via
wireless to Columbus, X. M.)
Trapped and flghtlns against heavy
odds, the troops of the Tenth Caval
ry engaged at Carrizal on Wednes
day, charged twice directly Into the
Jaws of the ambush which the Mex
icans had laid for them. With bul
lets in his arm and shoulder, Cnpt.
Charles T. Boyd, the commander, re
mained in the saddle, leading his ne
gro troopers until they had captured
the concealed Mexican machine gun
trend:, whor. he foil, mortally
wounded with a bullet in tho eye.
This was the gist of the first de
tailed account of tho engagement
from American sources which was
brought to Gen. Pershing to-day by
Corporal Green, of C Troop, who
was at Capt. Boyd's side until he
fell.
rue Americans were flanked on
both sides by the Carranzlstas, who
had partly surrounded the little
command during a conference be
tween Gen. Felix Gomez, the Mexi
can, leader, and Capt. Boyd. In
front was a concealed Mexican ma
chine gun trench, from which a
stream of bullets unexpectedly was
poured into the American ranks.
Corjioral Green said that Capt.
Boyd, although wounded in the arm
and shoulder by the first fire, Im
mediately gave the order to charge,
and the detachment rode at top
speed, In a hall of bullets, directly
at the trench, capturing it Just as
the American leader fell. The Mux
leans retreated to cover In a nearby
adobe shack.
Lieut. Henry Adair assumed com
mand and ordered a second charge,
which drove through the shack,
scattering the Mexican command.
Green said he did not see Lieut.
Adair after this charge, and believed
that he lost his life. In It.
Meanwhile Capt. Lewis S. Morey,
commanding K troops, which also
were partly surrounded during the
parley, occupied another adobe
house with his men, from which lie
engaged a second detachment of the
Mexican?. While It Is assumed here
that Capt. Morey was wounded in
the fight, neither Corporal Green
nor any of the other survivors reach
ing hero knew anything of the out
come of his part of the fight.
It Is believed here, however, that
he may have collected the shattered
remnants of the American command
and Is bringing them slowly, and
through obstacles, to Gen. Per
shing's lines. The survivors arriv
ing here said that the Carranzlstas
circled far around Carrizal after the
engagement, and overtook and cap
tured n number of soldiers who had
been holding horses hack beyond
sight of the point where the fight be
gan. Piecing together the fragmentary
reports which have reached field
headquarters, all except twenty-one
of the eighty-four men engaged In
the fight have been accounted for.
These reports indicate that thirteen
were killed, seventeen taken pris
oner. Thirty-three have come into
camp here in the last two days, most
of them coming afoot over a desert,
suffering the greatest hardships
from lack of water.
News dispatches from Chihuahua
City yesterday Indicate that with the
capture of five additional prisoners
the captives In tho hands of the Car
ranzlstas now number twenty-two,
leaving sixteen of the men engaged
at Crrrizal unaccounted for.

FREIGHT SHIPMENTS TO
MEXICO ABE PROHIBITED
Washington, June 20. Customs
officials along the Mexican border
have been ordered to hold up freight
shipments into Mexico and to advise
the railroads to keep their rolling
stock" on the Amprlcan side of tho
line.
Treasury officials said the collec
tors were acting under general In
structions to co-operate with the
military authorities and that no spe
cific embargo orders had been issued.
Efforts to keep rolling stock out
of Mexico have the double purpose
of protecting the railroads on their
own account and also guard against
the loss of equipment which might
be npfcded for the transportation of
American troops In the event of ac
tual war.

FIRST WE OF OUR TROGPS
Would Be To Dig Pershing Out,
Say Experts Tentative
Plans Are Outlined.
A BIG .IOII LIES JUST AHEAD
El Paso, Tex., June 24. "Tho
first thing we would have to do
would be to fight our way in to re
lieve Gen. Pershing, If Intervention
crnies and It looks like Interven
tion now."
That's what army men along the
border say and already El Paso Is
speculating on Just how and where
the relieving columns will "go in."
As soon as the punitive expedition
crossed at Columbus, 'military ofll-1
cials predicted that troops left on I
th border would ha? to lu-w (lit-ir
way Into Chihuahua to save Per-1
shlng's column from a "trap."
Here is the situation the way thoy'
see it here now in case of lntervon-1
tlon:
First American troops would'
cross the border at Fabens, Tex.,
thirty-nine miles east of here, where I
there is a good bridge, and swing ur
the river toward Juarez, thus get- j
ting behind the Juarez garrison andj
preventing a conflict to imperii Elj
Paso. ,
Second With Juarez occupied thel
Mexico Northwestern and Mexico
Central (Xationnl) railroads would
be seized and troops rushed over
them to Gen. Pershing's advance'
base, near Nnmlquipa and his line ot
communications through' Chihuahua1
State. I
Third Troops alo would cross
the border at Presidio and march i
westward toward Chihuahua to com-1
pel a falling back of any Mexicans!
that should seek to oppose the Amer
ican advance along the .Mexico Cen-j
tral Railroad. !
Fourth Advances would be made
Into Mexico through Brownsville,
Laredo, Eagle Pass, Douglas and i
Nogales, or near those places, to
prevent Mexican attacks on those
American cities.
Fifth The American fleet would
seize the principal northern sea-1
ports Tamplco, Tuxpan and Yera
Cruz on the Gulf of Mexico, and
Guaymas and Topolobampo on the
Gulf of California. More southern
seaports may bo seized later If need
arises, the border believes.
Sixth American forces would be
stationed In Chilhuahua, Cananea.
and other cities where there are
large populations of Americans, to,
police those cities and protect Amer
ican residents.
Seventh With the militia pro
tecting the border, the regular army ,
then would go nbout ridding tlioi
northern section of Mexico of its '
bandits and restoring peaceful con
ditions. Eighth Should Carranza attempt
any organized resistance, marines
and troops would march on Mexico
City from Vera Cruz and Tamplco,'
and perhaps from Manzanlllo, on the I
Pacific coast, seizing the capital and I
taking over the government until It
Is considered safe to restore the
country to the hands of the Mexi-.
cans. !
That is what tho army would face '
In case of real intervention.
Women and children, as well ns
peons ami soldiers, would 'opposu
their march. Water would be pois
oned. Shots would bo fired by hid
den iarksmen from the roofs of
houses in apparently peaceful vil
lages, their horses would be stam
peded at night with the cunning that
only a Mexican peon or vaquero
part Spaniard but mostly Indian '
knows. '
Military experts say It would take
500,000 men and five years or more
in fliiMuentw nnd narlfv Mexico. I
DECLARES JAPAN WILL
NOT HACK UP MEXICO
Toklo, June 26. "Of course any
claim that the Japanese Govern
ment win assist Mexicans with mu
nitions and arms is out ot the ques
tion and absurd," said Baron Ishll,
Foreign Minister, to a correspondent
of the Associated Press, who naked
him for his views on the Mexican
situation. The interview was sought
on account of declarations attribut
ed to Mexican that assistances tlmd
been received from Japan that muni
tions and other assistance would bo
given to Mexico In event of war with
the United States.
"As for private Japanese eohi'pan
ies selling arms to Mexicans," the
Foreign .Minister continued','' "I con
sider it extremely improbable. As
you know, all available rides and
puns are being furnished to Japan's
allies to assist In bringing the Eu
ropean W"ir to a successful Issue.
"Let rip say this with all the em
phasis and earnestness at my com
mand," said the Minister, swlnelng
around In his chair. "The Japanese
nation sincerely hope3 that armed
conflict between the United States
and Mexico may be avoided."
