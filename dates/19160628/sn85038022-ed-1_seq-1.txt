has not oven been advised of the re

own responsibility, however, he sent
to the State Department two com
intinications. One complained against
the enforcement of a general embargo
on shipments to Mexico; the other re
cites that Mexican cltizcnc have been
arrested without cause In California
and Arizona. Thoy warned Secretary
Lansing that the present situation be
tweon the two governments can not

tho ambassador assumed that local au
thorities, not tho State Department

nratioua for the placing nnd mainten

Dtndo today. While tho quartermaster
department was working out details
for caring for more than 35,000 addl
tlonal men, General Kunston and his
staff were engaged In revising and tlx
ing tho long list of troops stations
with a view to starting a big, sweep'
Ing army across tho border If ueccs
sary, luid nt tho same, time leave nilo
qiiato protection for tlio border towns
nnd ranches oiwtho American side ot
tho boundary line.
Reports from General l'crshlng's col-
lUitns and general forces along the bor
der reached headquarters more fro
(iiiently than on Other days, but near
ly all had to do with tho routine of
a big army and cnrrlcd no news of
clashes with Moxlcnns, cither bandits
or troops of tho do facto government
Unless mado necessary by some un
mistakable act of Carrnnza's troops,
tho American nrmy will tako no hos
tlio steps towards Mexico until direct'
cd by tho war department. Army ot-
llcers reports told of continued con
ccntratlou of Mexican forces within
striking distance of tuo border.
Tho apparent intention of Sonora
commanders to send a forco ot 1,500
through Xaco to lilsbeo presumably to
raid tho copper plants there, appeared
today to havo been abandoned. When
tho report wns received last night the
twonty-second regiment of Infantry
was sent from Douglas to Ulsbco on a
special train. Today thoro came re
ports of a strengthening of tho Mexi
can garrison opposite Nogales.
General Davis, reporting on tho sit
uation about Xaco, Bald thnt there had
been a marked concentration of Moxl
can troops south of there, especially
at Cananea, whero thoro Is "said to be
six thousand men.
