?I HI
Twenty-Fifth Annual Gath
ering of Society in Full
Swing.
! Tonight the Experts Will
Banquet at the
Y.M. C.A. .
The Silver Jubilee convention of
the West Virginia Christian Endeav
or Society in now in full swing, and
indicatoins point to the most suc
cessful convention in the history of
the organization.
The opening session was held last
evening at the M. P. Temple and was
largely attended by delegates, visi
tors and a representative gathering
of local Endeavorers and their
friends. f
. The feature of the opening session
was the inspiring address of Karl
Lehmann, all southern secretary of
Endeavor societies of the south, who
is well and favorably known in this
city, where he has lectured on vari
ous occasions. Mr. Lehmann is an
enthusiastic speaker and carries his;
audience with him throughout his!
address. His subject was "The Real!
Christian Endeavorer" and he drew
a realistic picture of his ideas con
cerning the real Endeavorer.
The session was opened last night
with a spirited song service conduct
ed by Prof. Ralph E. Mitchell, a
chorister than whom there are none
better. Mr. Mitchell fe* quite*-a-fav
orite with Fairmont people, he hav
ing spent several weeks here as chor
ister with the Lyon Evangelistic par
ty several years ago. Under Mr.
Mitchell's leadership the chorus
choir rapidly took up the refrains
and song after song was wafted from
the throats of the singers under his
efficient leadership.
Tho welcoming address was deliv
ered by Mrs. Robert C. Jones, who
for many years was the leader of the
Junior Endeavorers of this city. She
made a pleasing talk, and the re
sponse was made by Rev. George W.
Pollock, pastor of the Presbyterian
church of Duckhannon.
Following the program, tho dele
gates and visitors were entertained
in the social rooms of tho church
with an informal reception. Brick
ice cream and cake were served by
the younger Christian Endeavorers,
who wore the colors, red and white,
of the organization.
Delegates are here in large num
bers, representing Huntington, Par
kersburg, ? Charleston, Clarksburg,
Bluefield, Martinsburg, Wheeling
and intermediate points.
President Louis E. Black, of Par
kersburg, is here and is presiding
over the sessions.
A splendid song service featured
the morning session today of the
convention, with Prof. Ralph E.
Mitchell leading a genoral chorus.
The .Endeavorers entered with spirit
into the singing and some solo work
by Prof. Mitchell was heartily enjoy
ed.
One of the enjoyable features of
the morning session was the Bible
study hour, conducted by Rev. Ed
ward Bates Turner. Rev. Mr. Tur
ner is well and favorably known in
this city, having conducted a Bible
study class in this city a few years
ago. The delegates with pencil and
note book followed closely the les
son from the fifth chapter of Mat
thew, as taught by Mr. Turner and
gleaned many practical ideas from
the lesson. Thursday morning Mr.
Turner will teach another class from
some chapter of the Bible.
Following Mr. Turner's Bible les
son, music was furnished by Prof.

Leads Simple Life On Trip
From Indianapolis to Fairmont
Wirt 0. Fauat, a son of J. W. Faust
of thja city who is a graduate from the
University of Wisconsin, and who la
now teacher of manuel training in the
public schools of Indianapolis, Ind.,
is footing it to this cfty from Indian

where he is taking a rest at the home
of his sister, Mrs. A. M. Jones, before
again starting on the hike which will
bring him to his destination, his home
on Locust avenue.
Mr. Faust started about ten days
ago from Indianapolis to tramp in
true hobo style. En* route he played
the part of a tramp and begged his 11t

in a blanket which he carried. Mr.
Faust travelled the National pike
from Indianpolls to Wheeling. He la
expected to leave Slatersvllle thia
week and tramp to this city where he
will spend his vacation with his fath

The object of the trip undertaken
by Mr. Faust was to see the sights
along the road and for the expert

Second Regiment
May Start Tonight
(By Associated Preas)
-CHARLESTON. W. Va., June 28 ?
Refusal of some of the men of the Sec
ond infantry to take the oath prescrib
ed by the War department will not
disqualify them for service on the bor
der, it became known today. General
Bond discovered that so many sol
diers objected to entering the Fed
eral service because the oath provid
ed a straight three-year enlistment
and reserve service of three years
and took up the matter with Washing
ton authorities. He received word
this morning that those who desired
could be sworn in under the Dick law
which means they may serve only to
the.expiration of the present enlist
ment.
Unusual stir marked the camp this
morning, Colonel Morrison having an
nounced that as soon as the medical
examinations were completo and It
was known the number of men who
have been accepted the order would be
given to entrain.
Railroad men in charge of the move
men said they had their plans laid,
and the trains ^ould be supplied
when needed.
Excellent time was made by the
surgeons and as soon as they were
exempted they were sworn into the
Federal army.
There was no authentic news con
cerning the First Infantry but there
was a persistent rumor that before
nightfall a formal order for mobiliza
tion would be issued by General Bond.

Each One Will Get a Bit of
the County's
Funds.
All of the banks in Marion county
will be named as depositories for
county funds in the hands of the sher
iff under the new county depositors
act, which goes into effect July 1,
1916.
Sheriff Conaway announced this to
day and although it is likely that about
four or the banks in Fairmont will re
ceive the bulk of tile profits yet every
bank throughout the county will re
law requires that interest be pad the
county on the daily balance of the
funds and that a report be made as
to the amount of the fund with the
added interest each 30 days. This in
terest .of 3 per cent on th? dyiiy| mi.
anc* willi^MSh*a considerable saving
to Marion county although the matter
of keeping separate accounts at va
rious banks will entail a greater
amount of work for the sherlfT.
The county funds are classified un
der the four heads of teachers funds,
building funds, general county fund,
and road fund. To avoid confusion
these will likely each be deposited In
i separate bank as a unit to draw i
checks for that particular kind of pur
pose rather than deposit a small
amount of each of the four in a num
ber of the banks. I
Instructions have been received by i
Sheriff Conaway from the State tax i
commissioner, Fred O. Blue, as to the
method of procedure necessary to be i
followed in changing from the old
manner of handling the county funds :
to the new. Under the new plan the
sheriff will pay all bills allowed by the
court and other authorized officials by
check instead of the orders that are
now used. Under the present plan
the orders are usually cashed at the
banks and perhaps each two weeks
Dr other interval are returned by the
banks to the sheriff who then deposits
a balance with the bank sufficient to
cover the total. Under the new plan
the orders or checks will be drawn
on an existing fund in the banks that
is drawing three per cent interest on
the daily balance.
It will likoly require a month or
more for the new system to be tried
before the amount of the average sum
saved tn tho county by the three per
cent Interest clause can be estimated.

BIG PICNIC YESTERDAY
One of the Most Interesting
Events Ever Held in That
Town.
The Basket Picnic and celebration
enjoyed by the Knights of Pythias of
Rievesville-yesterday In honor of the
twenty-first anniversary of their I
lodge was, in the words of one 01
their citizens "The grandest thing that
Rievesville ever saw." The celebra
tion opened in the morning with a
talk by Rev. C. C. Jarvis aud Rev. C.
W. O'Dell which was held in the
qchool auditorium. Rev. Mr. Jarvis'
main point was, that if every one who
belonged to a secret organization
would live up to the obligations im
posed on them by the lodge it would
make this a good and glorious coun
try. Rev. C. W. O'Dell spoke on
brotherly love and the love of our
selves for our neighbors. One of the
largest that ever attended a celebra
tion in a town the size of Rlevesv..lo
was present, it being the estimate i;iat
over 800 people attended the event.
After the opening services in the
morning the picnickers went to the
ball grounds where oue of the most
amusing games of the day was held.
The contest waa between the Fats
and Leans of the lodge. Crowds lined
the slde lints and laughed themselves
sick watching a 225 pound man trying
mWtrtrWwg in
cident of the game was that the pitch
er for the Fats was Rev. O'Dell weigh
ing 205 pounds while-the pitches ot
the LeanB was Rev. Jarvis weighing
135 pounds. The catcher for the fats,
C. C. Arnett weighed 200 pounds
the catcher of the Leans, Jimmle Stew
art, weighed 118. The score was 5 to
1 in favor of the Leans. Right after
the game the people adjourned to the
orchard back of the school and en
joyed a big dinner which put the Fats
In a good humor.
At 1:30 another game of ball waa
played between the secret order nine
and the River Bend boys which re
sulted in a victory for the boys from
the Bend to the tune of 6 to 1. Next
In order came the throwing contest of
the ladies. This was won by little
Flora Benson with Ruth Thorn follow
ing close behind. The prizes for this
were $1 for first place and fifty cents
for second place.
Flora Benson also won the foot race
which again netted her $1. Now came
the Fat Man's race witji the puffing
o fthe heavy weights, and the holding
and tripping of the contestants. Lyle
Hall at last won the race.
Luclle Doll the ladies representative
in the swimming contest swam the
river in eight and one-half minuteB and
wimt three dollars and on-half.
After the contests the people went
to the schoool auditorium where they
litsened to addresses by Rev. O'Dell,
Rev. Jarvis and Robert Polllck. The
talks were very interesting and were
enjoyed by the people. The Grant
Town Band arrived on the 6:30 car
and gave concert which was of a very
high order.
At 7:00 the Grand Parade was held
headed b ythe Grant Town Brass
Band. The Pythian Sisters an organ
ization ust formed of the ladies of
Rlevesrllle with a membership of
twenty-five strong joined In the parado
and theBe with the Knights made a
grand total of 200 persons In line.
The lodge members all visited the
regular lodge hall which is a beauti
ful three story building bought and
fixed up by the local lodge at a cost
of $5,500. The lodge is adjoined by a
eight ro<#n flat which Is rented to two
families. At the meeting the mem
bers were given a talk by Sam R. Nu?
zum. past grand chancellor of the
Knights of Pythias.
One of the most Important proposi
tions decided on was that the regular
lodge would .look after the younger
members of the lodge who belonged
to the state guard and that they would
ay all their exenses while on duty In
defense of their country.
There were many people from Fair
mont In attendance at the celebration
and also from the surrounding towns.

rangements were: J; A. Hess, Esta

$7,500 GOAL F08 TODAY
fWomen of the Legion Have
Pledged An Additional
$2,000.
I ' , ?
Seven thousand five hundred dol
lars is the goal for which the congre
gation of the PreBbyterlan church of
this city is striving for today in the
$50,000 campaign which is boing wag
ed to secure that sum toward the erec
tion'of a $75,000 church In this city.
Leaders in the campaign are opti
mistic, today and believe that by eight
o'clock tonight, the hour at which tne
hands on the clock are moved up, that
thig sum will be pledged to the fund.
Good ground is held for this expec
tation because the fact that each
day's effort so far, have been reward
ed by the sum aimed for and consid
erable in access.
Last night at eight o'clock the sum
of $7,974 was secured by the teams
engaged in the campaign bringing the
auu total secured up to this hour, to
?.30,308 and being close to two thou
oand mere than was expected from j
yesterday's ennvass.
Tonight it /.b thought the figures on
tho dial of toe clock will be close to j
$40,000.
Last night the women of the Le
gion society of tho Presbyterian
church pledged $&?00 to the fund.
These same w?t>fen have already
