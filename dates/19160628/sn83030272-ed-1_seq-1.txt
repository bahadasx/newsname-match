Major-Gen. Leonard Wood, head of the
Department of the Hast, received orders
from the War Department last nlgnt
which left no doubt of the fact that the
demand for the National Guard on thj
border Is not only urgent but Immediate.
He was directed to send the organlzi-
lions in ills department without delay.
One of the orders from the War De-1
I partment In fact advised him that the
; need for cavalry Is so great that a
mounted unit is to be considered "rea
sonably prepared" even If It has ,io
homis, and is therefore to be sent to
the border at once.
