CARRANZISTAS WHIPPED
Unable to Give Exact Num

Made Captive. -
(My the Sun News Servise.)
El Paso, Tex., June 27.-Carrizal
has been avenged, at least in the
number of prisoners taken, if re
ports brought here today from the
Pershing base are true.
Americans who left Colonia Dub
Ian on Monday, reaching here this
afternoon, brought the report that
as they left the camp trucks were
arriving with Mexican prisoners.
One man said he counted forty pris
oners, all Carranza soldiers. He
said the escort in charge of the
trucks reported that one of the
American columns sent to the reli.:f
of Capt. Boyd's force, ambushed at
Carrizal, had encountered a force
of Carranzistas on the Santa Maria
River, and had killed a large num
ber and made many others prison
ers. The truck train coming to
the border was about to leave as
the prisoners arrived, the Ameri
cans said, and they had no time to
get any of the details.
we Repet F*em. Poramanw.
Gen Pershing had not reported the
matter officially tonight, so far as
Gen. George Bell. brigadier aemmand
er at this point. was aware, but it
was thought that he might have cen
sidered the engagement of minor k
nortance and was. hai=g -bak 8 V60
port until be could hear from the of
ficer in command of the Amerea
forces engaged.
Maj. John X. Jenkins was in com
mand of the expedition sent to the re
lief of the Tenth Cavalry victims of
the Carrizal fight, but it is not known
if his troops or another command of
American forces engaged the Mex
icans. It is known that Gen. Pershing
has thrown out a number of detach
ments along his line of communica
tion to prevent Carranza surprises
from the east, and it is thought pos
sible that one of these commands en
gaged the Carransistas in the act of
moving too close to the American
line.
Troopers Held at Juares.
Two more of the American com
mands at Carrizal were accounted for
today, when two negro soldiers of the
Tenth Cavalry were brought to Juarez
from Guzman. They are now being
held prisoners in the old Federal jail
in Juarez in charge of the military.
They are believed to have been strag
glers from the two troops engaged by
Carranza forces at Carrizal who es
caped, wandered on the desert, and
finally reached Guzman. where Mar
celo Caraveo and his 500 Carranza
troops are garrisoned.

PARIS DISPATCHES GIVE
BRIGHT VIEW OF CHANGE
(By the Intermational News Service.)
London, June 27.-Evidence of what Is
hoped here is the long-expected simul
taneous offensive of all the allies continue
today.
At the northern end of the western line,
from south of Artois to Flanders, the
Britlah and French guns are still pound
Ing the German positiont with especial
violence in the vicinity of the Somme.
At some points the bombardment has
been incessant for seventy-two hours.
In the Verdun sector, on this, the 127th
day of the battle, the French have made
a slight advance east of the Meuse in
a strong effort against the Thiaumont
works and, according to the Paris of
ficial, have repulsed a series of German
attacks on both sides of the river.
In the Tyrol, the retreat of the Austro
Hungarian army, according to late re
ports, has developed into a flight in which
wounded, guns and stores are abandoned.
For the first time since hostilities opened
Italy is using cavalry in its pursuit.
On the eastern line the*Rusians either
continue their pursuit of the Austrians
into the Carpathians or are fighting
pitched battles with the Germans in the
northern sections of the long line.
The hope felt here that the "great
drive" baa really msaterialized is brightly
reflected in dispatches from Paris, which
have assumed a tone of elation and con
fidence. The Germans are no longer the
masters, they assert.

ULTIMATUM, SAYS ENVOY
Eliseo Arredondo, the Mexican Ambas
sador-designate. addressed two commu
nications to the State Department yes
terday afternoon. one demanding the re
lease of certain Mexican civilians arrest
ed on the border by civilian authorities,
and the other requesting relief from an
embargo placed by American customs
authorities on the shipment of foodstuffs
and other merchandise into Mexico.
The communications, it was stated at
the Mexican Embassy, were not based
on any instructions from Mexico City,
and were not to be regarded as a part
of Carranza's reply to the American de
mand for the release of the American
troopers captured In the Carrizal engage
ment andtaken to Chihuahua.
Conce-ning the Mexican civilians ar
rested on this side of the border, the Am
bassador advises the State Department
that the Mexican consul at San Fran
cisco notified him yesterday that -at Red
ding, Cal., one group of fifteen Mexicans
was arrested last week and another of
fourteen on June 21 by the local aurnort
ties of that town without cause or justi
fication. The Ambassador further stated.
in addressing the department, that J. M.
