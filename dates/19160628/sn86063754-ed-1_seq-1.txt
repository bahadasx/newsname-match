Wilson Orders Carranza lo Release
Prisoners
Washington, June 25.?A demand
for the immediate release
of the American troopers taken
prisoner atCarrizal coupled with
a stern notification that the Uni
iea oiaies expects an early statement
of the purposes of the Carranza
Government was telegraphed
to Mexico City today
by Secretary Lansing.
The note discloses that the
State Department received yes
terday a communication from
the de facto Government stating
that the Carrizal fight was the
direct result of orders to attack
American soldiers moving otherwise
than towaids the border
personally issued by General
Parrarno Jn Connrnl ' I *^
xyunuubu IV VJ^UCim 1 ICVlllVI
and by the latter communicated
to General Pershing.
In reply Secretary Lansing requires
that the de facto Government
transmit a definite state
ment "as to the course of action
it has determined upon," through
the usual diplomatic channels,
*and not through subordinate
military officers."
The Mexican communication
is construed, Secretary Lansing
states, "as a formal avowal of deliberately
hostile action against
the forces of the United States
now in Mexico and of the purpose
to attack without provoca
tion whenever they move from
their present position* despite the
friendly mission on which they
are engaged and which is re affirmed
in the American rejoinder.
General Carranza is required
to place himself-on record formally
and the plain intimation
lies behind the restrained lan
guage of Mr. Lansing's communication
that force will be met
with force. Apparently, how
ever, the Washington Government
is determined that the de
tacto Government shall not
evade responsibility before the
world if war is forced upon the
United States.
Russians Take Austrian Land
Petrograd, June 25.?Occupation
ot the entire Austrian crown
land of Bukowina was aunounc
ed by the war office today. Possession
of the province was completed
by the capture of Kimpolung,
in southern part of Bukowina,
at the foot of the Carpathians.
1 f A1 AAA
more man z,uuu prisoners were
captured.
Russian troops further north
are pressing along the river
Pruth toward Kolomea and have
occupied the villages of Kilikhof
and Toulokhof.
The official statement says:
"Western front; West of Snia
tyn (on the Pruth 20 miles northwest
of Czernowitz) our troops,
fighting as thev advanced, occupied
the villages of Kilikhof and
Toulokhof.
"On the evening of June 23 ihe
a_ 0 % r
lown 01 Minpolung was taken
after intense fighting. Sixtv officers
and 2,000 men were made
prisoner and seven machine
guns were captured. In the rail
way station whole trains were
captured.
"Joe," said a newly married
man to an old friend whom he
met at the club, "what did you
can your wife's mother when
you were first married? I don't
like the idea of calling mine by
the endearing name of 'Mother.*
"
"Well,*' said Joe, "it was like
this with me: For a while I addressed
her as 'say,' but before 1
was married a year I called Jier
'Grandma,*"
Two Cavalry Troops Almost 1
Annihilated
San Antonio, Texas, June 23.
?The two troops of the Tenth 1
cavalry under Capt. Charles T.
Royd practically were wiped out
by the attack of Mexican forces
under Gen. Felix Gomez at Car
rizal June 21, according: to indications
g[iven in fragmentary re
ports received by Gen. Funston
from Gen. Pershing tonight.
Ger. Pershing's message stated t
that seven survivors in all, in- 1
eluding those who arrived last 1
night, have reached the main s
column. All were enlisted men. t
According to the stories of the i
survivors, as outlined in Gen. s
Pershing's report, a mounted i
force of Mexicans made a charge t
from the flank of the American 1
troops at the conclusion of a *
parley between Capt. Boyd and c
Gen. Gomez at the same time >
that a machine gun opened fire (
from the front as Gen. Gomez
reached his lines. i
Capt. Boyd had ordered his s
men to dismount as the machine 1
gun opened fire and the combin- <
ed effect of the Mexican charge, c
the machine gun fire and the
rifle fire from the Mexican gar- <
rison of Carrizal which had al- >
most surrounded the little Amer- t
ican force under cover of the i
parley sought by Gen. Gomez to t
discuss whether Capt. Boyd i
should be allowed to pass (
through the town, stampeded i
the horses. t
XT. 1 - ? -
ino aeiaus were made known t
to Gen. Pershing as to whether t
the Mexican charge was check c
ed. ]
With mounts gone, caught
without means of escape, ringed <
-about on three side with the fire 5
of an over-whelming force, the s
fate of the little detachment is 1
believed by officers here to have 1
been setled. It is feared that 1
only the most stupendous luck, <
backed by desperate valor, could
have extricated Capt. Boyd's
men from the trap.

How The School "Dipper? *
Spreads Disease W
In many counties the county J
>oards of health r equire individ- jo
ml drinking cups in the com e
non schools. In some instances j.
hey have required the use of :
water coolers, one in each room *
->( the building, while in other f
:ases they have required only s
inch family in school to secure -J
i drinking cup. ^
This is a long step in the right ?
lirection; something that should ?
lave been done in every county P
ong ago. How many of the di-|]fi
leases of school children are jp
raceable to the use of the com- &
non dipper? How often do we 1
;ee a "bad cold" spread until '
ivery child in school has con- I
racted the disease, and this i
argely due to the use of the <
'dipper." And not only are E
:olds and grip contracted in this f>
>vay, but many other contagious y
liseases.
Let the teachers leave no stone J|
inturned in their efforts to in- k
tall the individual drinking cup. j
bailing in this in any particular ^
:ase, let them endeavor to se- j,
iure the family drinking cup. B
The water cooler should be us- M
id in connection with the cups f|
vhere it is possible to obtain fj
hem. In case the funds for the T
)urchase of these can not be ob j<
ained in any other way, it J
vould be economy in the end to n
ievote enough of the school j-,
unds to this purpose. Where fa
hese cannot be installed, have
he pupils take the water from ^
he bucket with a dipper. Nev- ?
it in any case allow the pupil to tj
:>lace his cup. in the bucket. j]
As to how soon the "common $
iipper" is banished from the ^
ichoolToom depends almost ab- *
?olutely upon the interest of the ^
leachers and their activities in j
his direction. It will disappear .
