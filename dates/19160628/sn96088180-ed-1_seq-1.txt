RELEASE OF
PRISONERS
Wilson Says Soldiers at Chi
huahua City fet Have Li!
erty by Ifidsight or U. S.
Will Go After Them
Washington, Jane 28. General
Carrans must release the United
State prisoners held at Chihuahua
City by midnight or President Wil
son will go after them.
Those close to the president today
declared there will be no delay be
cause of demands from Carranza that
Mexican prisoners held In this conn
try be released and the embargo on
food supplies Into hi , country be
lifted.
That, according to administration
officials, is another . question. The
president, they declare, la solely in
terested In getting some 24 men
wesrlng V. 8. uniforms out of the
penitentiary at Chihuahua.
There is feeling here that Car
ranza will yield.. It Is known posi
tively that he bad Intended to re
lease tha United State prisoners.
.Should Carranza take tbe position
of delsying the freedom of the United
St tes prisoner, the president would
follow the course' of action already
determined pon. It would not In
clude a declaration of war. It would
'mean the rescue of the United States
soldiers by force. If necessary, bow
ever long and arduous the effort. The
president would outline bis intended
course to congress and ask support
. for tbe program.
PEACE III AMERICA
HOPE OF DR. IIAOII
New York, June 28. Hope for a
peaceful settlement between the
United States and Mexico In the In
terests of Pan-Americanism was ex
pressed today by . Dr. Romnlo 8.
Xaon, " Argentine ambassador to
Washington. In a statement to the
United Press, tbe ambassador said
he had not made any formal offers of
mediation on behalf of his govern
ment, but expressed the belief that
war will yet be avoided. His state
ment follows:
"I have made no offer, but It Is
unnecessary to say that the Argentine
government always Is disposed., to
work for the peace of America. Pan
Amerlcanlsm, which Is vital for all
the countries of the continent, wheth
er great or small, strong or weak,
makes war between two American
nations utterly Inconceivable. I am,
In candor, confident that the present
crlsla will be peacefully settled. We
mu8t make evident that no matter
how great tbe differences between
wo American governments, the con
ilnental interests of concord and
union are similar and Inconsistent
with recourse to violence. The Ar
gentine people and government are
fifllowlng this conflict with tbe
deepest concern, and notwithstand
ing th acutebess of the crisis, I be-
;iiVeib Inspiration of a sound, far-
HgbledVolltlcal sense will prevail
Is these bears o full of peril for the
8 Msttoies5 of 'the continent."
