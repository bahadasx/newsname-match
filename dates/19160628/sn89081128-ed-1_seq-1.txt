/Well,
^thought
they're gone and those who
the call to the militia would be
only a flash in the pan have found once
more that it is the unexpected that
happens. Like a bolt out of a clear sky
came the call to arms a week ago and it
was impossible to believe that withm
just one short week all the local guards
men would be on their way to the
mobilization camp at Fort Snelling with
the probability of being promptly pushed
on to the border. Those who have
studied the situation seem to feel that
the chances are against the militia
stopping long at Fort Snellmg and the
fact is that they are likely to see some
real service. However, the Mexican
situation has been an unsolvable puzzle
so long that no one can say what the
next day may bring forth and it is quite
within the limits of possibility that the
boys may come marching back home
j- without having left our own state.
Promptly at the appointed hour, 7:45
cNJ^lock Monday morning, the transport
cars were drawn up to receive the
waiting men after their march from the
armory to the Northwestern station.
Hundreds of friends of the boys who
were going, business men and their
employes, mothers, sisters and sweet
hearts thronged the approaches to the
station to give a cheering word to the
departing soldiers who at the last seemed
to realize the actual fact that they were
fc leaving for the front. The men made a
fine husky looking lot, showing strength
^o*^and health enough to carry them through
tlie* hardships of a summer the south
I provided they are thoroughly coached
in the proper care of themselves.
Major Pfaender was command of
j. the troops that entrained, Lieut. Burt
Hubbard acting as his battalion adjutant.
Lt. Hubbard had reached the city several
days ago and was of material assistance
in recruiting up the companies here.
Capt. B. Groebner was in command of
Co. "A" with 1st Lt. Adolf Klause and
3jtfd Lt. Alfred Puhlmann as platoon
^/commanders. Lt. Puhlmann was re
Jp cently elected and takes the place of Lt.
Amann who resigned some months ago.
The Machine Gun Company was in
charge of 1st Lieutenant Wm. H. Bier
baum and he was assisted by 2nd
Lieutenant John Dengler. Under the
army regulations the Machine Gun
Company will be under the command of
Capt. Quartermaster Frank Hubbard.
There is no provision for the election of
a captain and therefore no successor was
elected to Capt. Ed. Juni when he re
signed.
After the call came for the men to
prepare for orders to move at any time,
the streets of New Ulm were constantly
filled with the soldier boys in their khaki
uniforms, and the recruiting sergeants
were very busy, not only in the city but
in the vicinity and in other nearby
towns. However, the force as finally
completed was gathered practically all
in New Ulm, the only outsiders being
vth Hanska men and those who were
formerly located here. It was expected
hourly that the orders to leave would
be received and all was in readiness to
go Friday, again Saturday and when
the final telegram was received setting
the time at Monday at 7:45 A. M. the
suspense was over and everybody pre
pared to bid the boys a cheerful good
bye.
The Commercial Club arranged a
banquet for them at the Armory for
Saturday night which proved a most
pleasant affair, showing the enlisted
men that those who are staying behind
appreciate their services and expressing
"the hearty good wishes of all that the
isoldiers will soon be back among us
'at their tasks of peace. At the banquet,
Philip Liesch acted as toastmaster and
called upon a number of the military
men who responded. Major Pfaender,
Major Fntsche, Sergt. Pfeiffer and
Corp. Christenson were the principal
speakers and all the boys had a chance
to say a word when Sergt. Pfeiffer called
upon them to give three rousing cheers,
to which all responded with a vim.
[t was planned to have a dress parade
inday evening on North German
Park common but the storm coming
up prevented this and also the concert
which the band was to give in the park.
There is not a doubt that the park
•would have been jammed to the edges

had the concert been given and the
thousands of people were sadly" disap
pointed that they could not hear,their
favorites once more.
A farewell dance was given at the
Armory on Friday evening by mem
bers of the band and it was attended
by nearly three hundred couples. Each
evening crowds of people witnessed
the drills evidencing their keen interest.
Co. Auditor Vogel has offered his
services in raising a volunteer company
here to form one of a regiment to be

THREE ORDINANCES
ON CITY STATUTES
THIRSTY ONES CATCH IT GOING
AND COMING. NO RELIEF
IN SIGHT.
CITY ATT'Y. PFAENDER GIVEN
LEAVE OF ABSENCE WITH
HIS COMMAND.
More "protection" for the minor and
the irresponsible who is bent on making
himself still more irresponsible by licking
up all the "red eye" he can get hands on,
was the topic of the evening's discussion
at the City Hall Thursday evening when
the Council met in special session. In
other words, a new ordinance was passed
designed to keep youngsters young and
youngsters old from getting into trouble
by too free indulgence in the inebriating
beverage that has been flowing so freely
in New Ulm the past several days. This
ordinance in full appears elsewhere in
this issue of the Review and the sub
stance of its subject matter is that the
inebriate or the minor is equally liable
to be convicted of a misdemeanor with
the man who furnishes him the drink.
Heretofore it was the saloonkeeper who
was expected to act as his brother's
mentor and refuse to supply the irre
sponsible one with the longed-for thirst
cooling beverage. Now the man who
gets the benefit of aforesaid beverage is
likely to be called on the carpet before
the justice of the peace and asked to
explain his conduct if one of the guard
ians of the law happens to drop around
just in time to see, (and hear) the trans
action. However, the dealer can not
get off less than a ten dollar fine while
the thirsty individual can count his
change and if he has $5. in his jeans over
and above the price of the drink, can
take a chance for he will have enough
to keep him out of jail if he can make the
judge believe he is a "first-timer". The
ordinance also gives the extreme penal
ties, and those interested are referred to
page 2 of this issue.
A second ordinance also acted upon
at the same meeting provided for the
licensing of Moving Picture Houses.
Each house must pay a fee of $25.00.
The third new ordinance is for the con
trol of pool and billiard halls and pro
vides for a license fee of $5.00 for each
table per year.
City Attorney Pfaender asked for and
was granted leave of absence from his
duties for the period of one month by
which time it is devoutly hoped that the
men will all be back and going about
their jobs again.
Another matter that has recently been
settled quite to the satisfaction of the
City Fathers is the question of whether
the city can pay for work done with
warrants issued when there is no money
on deposit to cover said warrants. The
City Attorney was recently asked for an
opinion in the subject since there are no
funds to take care of certain improve
ments asked by residents of North State
Street. The City Attorney decided that
the City might issue such warrants
which would be good at the various banks
with the agreement that the City pay
six per cent interest on such advanced
moneys. Property owners along Front
Street between Center and Fifth North
will also come for a share of the im
provements to be made on borrowed
capital. Property owners are given ten
years to pay off their share of the in
debtedness which amounts to $1.30 per
running foot for the work on sewers,
balance to be paid by the city and the
grading work is paid in the proportion
of two thirds by the property holders
and one third by the city.
SONS OF HERMAN COMING.
Henry Herrian has received word that
the Order of the Sons of Herman will
picnic at New Ulm Sunday, July 16th.
The members of the Order in St. Paul
and Minneapolis will invade New Ulm
by way of a special train that will bring
about six hundred people and a great big
day is promised.

ATTEMPTS MURDER
GUILTY OF ATTEMPTED
SUICIDE.
BOY HELD FOR EXAMINATION.
—IS A SIBLEY COUNTY
PRISONER.
Sheriff Julius received into his custody
from Sibley County last Saturday Adolph
Anderson a prisoner who is a mere boy
and yet is charged with wilfull intent to
commit murder upon the person of his
father. The boy is but fifteen years old
and does not look in the least like a
desperate character but he has been
bound over to await examination and
the hearing will take place early in July.
The crime of which young Anderson
is accused is surrounded with mystery.
There is only the word of the father
against the boy and the boy quite as
earnestly claims that the father at
tempted to commit suicide and failing
regretted his rash act and then laid the
blame of his wounds at the hands of his
son. The father's name is Gustav An
derson and he is a farmer living in Sibley
County, Town of Severance. The son
since his arrival at the Brown County
bastile has written a pitiful letter to his
mother and other relatives begging them
to try to induce his father to tell the
truth about the gun shot wounds which
he received June 7th but nothing further
is known of the case.

MANKATO PREPARES
AGAINST INVADERS
HAS ARMORED AIR SHIP FOR
BIG CELEBRATION AND
HOME COMING.
EVERY THING IN READINESS
FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY
FESTIVITIES.
One of the interesting and instruc
tive Fourth of July attractions at Man
kato, aside from the historical pageant
of Southern Minnesota history, will be
an armored air ship, such as is used in
modern warfare. It will make flights
during the day. Undoubtedly it is the
first one of the kind to be seen in the
Northwest, for even the United States
government owns but very few, if any,
although it probably will soon have
squadrons of them along the Mexican
border, for they are proving indispens
able on the European fighting front.
Preparations are now completed for
the presentation of the pageant. The
weeks of drill and rehearsals are over,
and all that remains to do is to present
the finished scenes, which will be done
the afternoon of July Fourth, beauti
ful Sibley park, against the mound where
Gen Sibley and his troops camped at
the time of the Indian outbreak. The
pagean^ opens with a seventeenth cen
tu scene, with i*e Indians pooalaoii'-^

Oxen have been found for the early
immigrants, and all of the ether difficul
ties have been smoothed away.
A contract has been awarded for the
greatest fireworks display ever seen in
Mankato. Exciting ball games, fore
noon and afternoon, parades, band con
certs, etc., will help to feature the big
gest celebration Mankato has yet under
taken.
Special efforts are to be made to have
the roads in condition for. automobiles,
as it is realized that thousands will drive
to the city from a distance of sixty or
seventy miles in every direction.
We are assured that if the people from
this vicinity who will be in Mankato the
Fourth do not see what they want, all
they will have to do will be to ask for it.
Mankato's well known hospitality will
see that it is forthcoming.
The events of "home coming week''
in Mankato begin Saturday night,
July 1, with a competition of welcom
ing bonfires, to be lighted on the bluffs
surrounding the city. The person or
group having the biggest bonfire will
receive a prize of $15, and in this way
six cash prizes are to be offered for the
biggest and most illuminating bonfire.
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday are
to be filled with events of interest to
former residents, of whom many hun
dreds are expected. The invitations
to the home-coming have followed former
Mankato people into nearly every state
in the union, to nearly every part of
North America, to Asia and Europe, and
even to the trenches in France. They
have gone to 234 cities and villages in
Minnesota, 49 towns in North Dakota,
an equal number in South Dakota, 64
in California, 41 in Washington and so on.
OPENS NEW LAW OFFICE
Alfred W. Mueller, for the past few
years a member of the law firm of Som
sen, Dempsey & Mueller, has decided
to open a law office for himself and
will occupy the rooms in the Dietz
block formerly occupied by the late
Jos. A. Eckstein. Mr. Mueller has
purchased the law library and all fix
tures of Mr. Eckstein. Just as soon
as the new Weiser building is completed
he will move into a suite of rooms in
the new building.

DESPONDENT MAN
COMMITS SUICIDE
BURDEN OF ILL HEALTH PROVES
TOO GREAT FOR LONELY
FELLOW.
CHOOSES TEN MINUTES OF
AGONY RATHER THAN YEARS
OF SUFFERING.
Despondency caused by suffering and
ill health induced Joseph Bruckbauer
who lived alone at the north end of
State Street to commit suicide by hang
ing some time Sunday night or Monday
morning. The man had been unable
to find any relief from his sufferings and
finally became desperate and chose a
desperate remedy for his troubles.
The unhappy man was about 66 years
old. He had been a saloon keeper at
Sleepy Eye for a long time but four
years ago he removed to New Ulm. He
and his wife had decided to separate
and she remained at Sleepy Eye where
most of the children were living and he
came here and lived alone. His sons
came frequently to see their father and
looked after his needs but he had gradu
ally grown more and more ill until at
last he was so afflicted that he could not
rest in any way and in a letter he left
addressed to his neighbors he said that
he had not had a night's sleep in a year
and could bear it no longer. The letter
announced his intention of ending the
struggle, saying that the suffering could
last but a few minutes whereas if he
continued to live on he should have to
bear the pain and discomfort for years.
A neighbor woman who went to the
house to take the old man's daily supply
of milk Monday morning discovered the
body hanging by a small wash line from
a hook in the ceiling. One foot was still
on the chair which he had made use of to
carry out his design upon his life. The
sheriff and the county coroner were
called and the evidence- that he had
committed suicide was so plentiful that
no inquest was deemed necessary and
the relatives claimed the body and took
it to Sleepy Eye for burial.
The deceased was possessed of some
little funds in the form oi certificates of
deposit. The money amoanted to $750
and was in the name of a daughter,
Margaret, living in St. Paul. The
father directed the statement he left
that she keep this money except what
should be used to defray funeral
expenses. Other children of the family
are John J., Joseph, Jr., William and
Mrs. Jno. M. Schroepfer of Sleepy Eye.
TENNIS ACTIVITIES.
For the past few weeks tennis has been
one of the main topics talked about by
a certain group of New Ulmites, and
according to the present outlook tennis
will be one of the chief sporting events
in the city this summer and for all others
to follow. All the tennis enthusiasts
are practicing whenever they have a
chance and are trying to get into as
perfect form as possible for the tourna
ment to be held sometime during August.
Not being content with games between
themselves severaLef the boys have ar
ranged matches between out-of-town
players. Patrick Eibner and John Graff
met and defeated two boys from Sleepy
Eye, Kleinschmidt and Hoffenberger.
Each of these boys is about fourteen
years of age and they were evenly
matched. The New Ulm boys had
little trouble in beating their opponents
and after taking the first set 6-4 they
dropped the second set 6-3. In the
third set the boys again settled down
and took it 5-3. Eibner and Graff
announce that they will meet any two
players (in doubles) between the ages of
twelve and fourteen.
John Christoverson and Wm. Meusing
met two fellows from Madelia but were
unable to cope with the visitors and were
defeated in three straight sets. The first
set went to the visitors 6-2 the second
6-1 and the last 6-0. The visitors had
the advantage over the local boys In'
height and were thus able to meet the
high ones better. The names of the
visiting players were Olaf Larson and
Desmond Hale.
All tennis players who wish to have
a set of 1916 tennis rules should send
their names to the "Review" by the end
of the week and a copy will be sent them.
Check raisers are getting in considerable
of their fine work in this vicinity and it.
would pay all business people to be very
careful into whose hands their checks
are likely to fall and also to be% wary of
cashing any checks for persons who are
not known. Fairmont, Sleepy Eye and
Springfield have all been visited by the
