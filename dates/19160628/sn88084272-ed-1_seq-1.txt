as being favorable to restriction of
the liquor traffic,"' according to Wayne
B. Wheeler of 'Washington, D. O, gen

of America, in an address to the 17th
convention of that organization.
The courts," said Mr. Wheeler, "haTe
gradually come to the conclusion that
legislation necessary to enforce
statutes will be upheld if the original
statute prohibiting the evil was legal.
Justice Hughes speaking for the su
preme court laid aown this principle:
"'It is well established. said the
justice, that when a state exercising
its recognized authority, undertakes to
suppress what it is free to regard as
a public evil, it may adopt such meas
ures having reasonable relation to that
end. as it may deem necessary in or
der to make its action effective ' "
Mr. Wheeler asserted that the bur
den of pronouncement b the courts,
state and federal, was against the li
quor traffic.

pau.h from special .igeut Rodger jL
Mexico City hroaxbt only the laxersm
tion that a special car left Tuesday far
era Cruz, carrying 70 Americans, In
cluding 21 from Guanajuato
The message, containing two sen
tences, was the first word the depart
ment had heard from Mr Rodgers since
he reported the delivery of the note
It said it was believed the Mexican au
thorities were investigating the Carri
zal flrtit but save no intimation of
I what would be the reply to the Ameri
can demands.
Probably Carranza's Ijtmt Day.
This was regarded by Washington of
ficials as the crucial day in negotia
tions with Mexico.
It was probably the last day allowed
Gen- Carranxa in wh'ch tc comply with
the United States demand for release
of 23 troopers held as prisoners at Chi
huahua City. If his reply, either by
act or it a communication, doe not
arrive by tonight, or if it is unsatisfac
tory, president Wilson is determined te"
go before congress, probably tomorrow,
and ask authority to rescue the pris
oners by force.
INotblng Out Release Will Do.
Anything short of immediate release
of the American trojpers win be un
satisfactory. No suggestions or pro
posals of negotiations ir this regard
will be accepted.
It was pointed out today that secre
tary Lansing's note nresentiair the de-
unand sought to open no discussion of
tne carnsaj inciden Tne tact that
the men were captured and were be
ing held was viewed as a hostile act
-requiring immediate repudiation hy tha
de facto government.
3Iay Lay Blame on Americans.
Mr. Rodger- statement that Car
ranxa officials appeared i j be conduct
ing an inquiry Into the Carrlzal clash
was interpreted here as indicating
rather that the reply would support
previoa-t assertions that American
troops were responsible than that a
change of attitude was to be expected.
Eliseo Arrendondo. the Carranxa ambassador-designate,
had received no
word today from 's chie about the
status of the diplomatic negotiations,
Mr. Arredondo had informed Gen. Car
ransa of tha determined sentiment In
the United States demanding the re
lease of the American troopers but has
had no reply.
