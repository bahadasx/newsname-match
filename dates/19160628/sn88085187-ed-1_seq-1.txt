WILL 1916 BE SUMMERLESS YEAR SUCH AS WAS 1816
Wintry June —a countrywide fact—has inspired many
■weather prophets, scientific and otherwise, to predict there will
be no really warm season.
Sun spots of extraordinary size are blamed by the Hey.
Frederick L. Odenbach, scientist of St. Ignatius college, Cleve
land, according to a dispatch today.
"I have never seen so many sun spots," he says.
"These spots are enormouß. One Is large enough to cover
the whole eastern and southern part of the United States.
"The sun spots do not directly control the weather, but

SOLDIERS HUDDLE
LIKE HENS; ENFOLD
GIRLS IN PONCHOS
By Mabel Abbott
Camp Elmer E. Brown looked as if it were in American lake instead of
near American lake yesterday afternoon.
There were little lakes in the company streets, the long grass was full of
water, and the soldiers huddled like hens under every available shelter, or
paddled philosophically where duty called them, with their "ponchos" swing
ing toga like around them.
A poncho looks something like a moderate-aixed tablecloth made of silk
and rubber, with a hole cut In the middle for the soldier's head to go through.
It weight only about a pound, and is capable of numerous and surprising
draping*, causing the weaver to resemble an animated tent, or a closed umbrel
la, according to his girth.
It is also useful as a delicate compliment to visiting sweethearts.
They were proud girls, yesterday, whose soldier-boys met them at the
ear and enfolded them in the clammy circumference of ponchos.
A GIRL WOULD BATHER LOOK LIKE A LATH CABINET IN A
PONCHO WHICH HAS BEEN WRAPPED AROUND HER WITH -UN
NECESSARY DELIBERATION BY HER BOY IN KHAKI THAN LIKE A
FASHION PLATE IN ALL HER GLADDEST CLOTHES.
Tall white shoes are especially effective with a poncho.
The stream of visitors did not slacken today and yesterday because of
the rain.
Every car brought a capacity load of men, women ami children, who
sloshed around with enthusiasm unabated by wet feet and streaming umbrel
las.
WILL YOU DO YOUR PART?
If all reports arc true, it is only a mailer of
hours until Troop 11, Tacoma's own troop, will
lie on Its way to the Mexican border.
Troop 11, like the rest of the I'nited Htales
militia. Is a thoroughly democratic institution.
There are men ln it whose going will mean no
hardship to their families except anxiety and
loneliness; ami side hy side with them are men
whose families will dally miss the breadwin
ner's earnings aa well as his presence.
An organization Is being formed, "the Troop
B Beserves," to keep In touch with the men in
the field and with their families at home, for
tlie one pur|M>se of helping both.
A mess fund has already been begun.
A iiit*ss fund Is a good idea. Fvery normal
man likes good things to eat. Yakima, Cen
tralia and other eititas much smaller than Ta
coma have raised mess funds amounting to
thousands of dollars in a day or two. We can
send our boys an many nice tilings as anybody,
and we will.
But the average man who is good enough to
$500 Already Raised
An organization of Troop B
Reserves, consisting of honorably
discharged members of Troop B,
is at present in process, and was
announced by Gen. J. M. Asbton
at the Commercial dub reception
to Troop B last evening.
Cash and subscriptions amount
ing to $227.70 were raised with
in a few minutes, as the nucleus
of a mess fund. Later subscrip
tions have brought the total up
to $500.
"Our purpose and aim," said
Gen. Ashton, "will be to look
after the troopers and their fami
lies. We want the names of
every trooper and his relatives,
and we are going to make It our
business to take care ot those they
leave behind. If necessary, we
will go down where the troopers
are and look after their wants and
comforts, if it is necessary to
do some scrapping, we will be
there to help do it."
Subscriptions and money were
tendered at once, and President
Wheeler of the Commercial club
appointed a committee of five to
handle donations, consisting of
F. K. Jeffries, chairman; Roy D.
Pinkerton, C. B. Welch, S. 8.
Anderson and Oscar Thompson.
make a soldier out of, gives his wife the best
piece of the steak at dinner, and buys certified
milk for the babies even if he has to give up
cigars to do it.
He will sleep better in his tent on the hot,
dry, lonely, sandy, fleu-infested border If he
knows that there Is no danger of their falling
behind with the rent; ami he will eat "canned
Willie" and hardtack without indigestion, if be
isn't worrying about whether the kids are still
fat anil rosy.
A fund should be placed in the bands of the
"Troop B Keserves" once, which will properly
express Tacoma's pride in her soldiers and will
take off their minds all anxiety about those they
leave behind.
The men may go at any moment. They ought
to go with light hearts, so far as we can make
them so.
Send In your check right away. Mark it
"Mess Fund," or "Hepcndent Fund," as you
wish It used.
Let's "do our bit."
Checks, it was said, should be
made payable to F. #E. Jeffries.

morning. At 12:30 today the
list was as follows:

their electric and magnetic Influence, combined with local
weather conditions, has an effect on the weather. The large
number of spots indicates an exceptionally cool summer.
"THIS YEAR IS THE ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVER
SARY OF THE FAMOUS SUMMERLESS YEAR OF 1816,
WHEN CORN SEED COST $7 A BUSHEL. AT THIS RATE
IT WOULD COST $28 A BUSHEL THIS YEAR."
Prof. John T. Timmons, famous weather expert, says he
looks for a summer of strange weather, intense heat will
alternate with sharp cold spells.

the stand today for further grill

composed university boy who took
his place In the witness chair yes
terday to tell of his relations
with Marian Lambert, the slrl lie

The embarrassing nature of the
testimony did not prevent the
women from returning and fight
ing for seats in the court room,
although many of them hung
their heads while Orpet told tbe
story of his meetings with the ;,irl
and of her betrayal.
Under savage attack, Orpet be
came confused when he was ques
tioned concerning the cyanide of
potassium, the poison which
caused Marian's death.
In explaining the purpose of
some '"brown dope" whlcb he
bought for Marian on two occa
sions Orpet shrank ba-k in the

self repeatedly.
From Orpet's own lips the
court heard the story of his act'tal
betrayal of his school girl sweet
heart. Under sharp cross-exam
lnation he said his relations with
Marian Lambert overstepped the
bounds of propriety only once. •
Orpet then was asked about his
return from the university a year
ago and having called on Marian.
"Her parents were there 81
--ways, but sometimes I stayed over
after they had gone to bed," Or
pet said.
Attention was called to a letter
which Orpet wrote Marian last
September in which he suid:

Sheriff Longmlre took up head

nonnced that 20 or 30 specials

Police officers last nlg'it began
