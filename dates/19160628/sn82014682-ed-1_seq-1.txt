her- back yesterday and - the bogus
husband who subjwltated himself at a

The outraged husband was not out
raged enough in feeling to call Ms
countryman, Toyama, out for a duel,
and so far the immigration officials
have made no known move to arrest
Toyama for the ruse by which he stole
the pretty 19-year-old Ushl from the
U. S. station. ; 1
- Inspector ' Halsey would not say
this morning whether Toyama would
be arrested.
Toyama, who was the husband of
Ushi for about two days and a half,
is back at his plantation work at
Heeia, according to information form
Japanese sources today. Ishihara and
his wife were at the Komeya Hotel
this morning, friends said.
Ishihara told a Star-Bulletin report
er today that he-has taken back his
wife and they will live happily here
after. He says he will take her to
his home on Kauai. Though apparent
ly angry at Toyama, his wrath does
not appear to be sufficient either to
reject his wife or take steps to punish
the man who stole her before the
American ceremony was performed.
U. S. Officials Reticent.
When asked for a statement at noon
today, Richard L. Halsey, U. S. inspec
tor in charge of the federal Immigra
tion station, said he is not in a posi
tion to say anything about the case.
Halsey refused to say whether his
office has sworn out a warrant against
Toyama for falsifying the marriage
records. "The matter is still under
investigation," was all he would say
for publication.
According to federal authorities, the
U. S; Immigration station here has
positive evidence that the girl In the
case, Ushl Ishihara, wrote to Toyama
after she landed here, and that both
know each other very well. Ishihara
says Toyama is a relative of the girl.

New Angle to Story.
The girl, according to this version,
afterhe received the letter from the
intended husband telling her not to
come to Honolulu, wrote to Toyama
from her .home in Japan and told him
how matters were and that she did
not want to marry Ishihara, either. .
Toyama is said to have replied in a
letter advising the girl to come to
Honolulu anyway and marry him if
she did not like the idea of marrying

schedule.
The girl came to this city, after
which Toyama showed up at the im
migration station, claiming to be Ishi

rightful name and explained to the
immigration authorities how matters
stood, there would have been no trou

Major Cowl Arrives on Lurline
and Departs on Matsonia :
. For Mexican Border
He sailed Into 'Honolulu and; then
sailed right out again. Such was the
experience todayr Maj. Donald Cowl

ing rapidly back to San Francisco on

Two weeks ago MaJ. Cowl, a
wealthy New York business man, was
married and started for Honolulu to
spend his honeymoon. Everything
was lovely until three days out of San
Francisco when the God of War got
busy and started trouble down on the
Mexican border, and on the hels of
that President Wilson called the state
national guards to arms. Maj. Cowl
was rudely awakened from his dreams
by a wireless ordering him to join his
regiment on the border.
What Maj. Cowl said when he re
ceived the message has been strictly
censored by the war office, but orders
are orders and he was forced, to im
mediately get busy and arrange for
transportation back to San Francisco.
He wirelessed to the Canadian-Australasian
office here and to the T. K, K.
office out no boats were Jeavlng for
several days and then word came that
the Matsonia would leave the same
day that the Lurline arrived at Hono
lulu. Preparations were Immediate
ly made for the . transfer and as the
Lurline came steaming into the har
bor this morning the major and his
blushing bride were swung overboard
into a waiting launch and rushed
aboard the Matsonia as she slid from
her berth at Pier 15. It was estimated
by Purser IT H. Levey, that Cowl
spent over $100, in arranging for
transportation.
This sudden stopping of the honey
moon and the fact that they would
not be able to set foot on the island
of Oahu greatly amused but aroused
the sympathies of the other passen
gers on the Lurline and as Maj. Cowl
and his wife left the Lurline to catch
the Matsonia they were showered
with rice and confetti.
It Is hoped that Maj. Cowl will re
ceive many medals for bravery on the
border in compensation for the brok
en honeymoon.

WASHINGTON. 1). C. June 28 Officials of the administration
regard ..this as the crucial day in Mexico's relations with the United
States. ' ;''.';
Developments of today are exjneted to mean war or peace between
the two countries. This is probably the last !ay the Mexican tic facto
government will be allowed in which to act upon the peremptory de
mands of the United States for the release of the American troopers
taken in the fight at Carrizal and now held in jail at Chihuahua.
Unless Carranza complies with the demand for the release cf the
10th Cavalrymen, the president lias made it known that he will act.
, If no reply arrives tonight from the Carranza government, or if
the reply that does come is ttnsatisf acton-, the president is determinetl
to go to Congress, probably tomorrow, and ask authority to rescue the
men by force of arms. That, it is admitted, mean war with Mexico.
Anything short of 'immediate release for the men is declared lot be
unsatisfactory.' ' . ; ; ,; ;... .. .
Suggestions or pr6x:sals that there le mediation or negotiation
over tins matter of the release of the men will not be accepted, it is
declared in high government circles.
