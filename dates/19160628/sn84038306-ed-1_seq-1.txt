COUNCIL MEETING
Th® city council met in regular
session on Manday night, with Mayor
Richardson .and Councilmen Hockaday
Davis, Williams, Dorman and Cowles,
and City Manager Matthews present.
A number of grievances w«re pre
sented by Manchester citizens. E.
M, Carr called the Council's attention
to the fact that the use of the sani
tary sewer as a storm water sewer
was causing damage in the press
room ot the Manchester Democrat.
He contended that the sanitary sew
ers of this city were not designed or
Intended to cure for storm water
that his property and the property of
others Was being damaged by this
improper use Of th« sanitary sewer.
urged *he council to cease using
the sanitary sewers as storm water
sewers..-
Carl Kullberg and Geo. Slack com
plained because th^lr petition *or
curb and gutter on south &th, street,
filed last year
had not been ghr«natten
tlon. it was stated that there was1 no
established. grade .on that street and
that the work had been delayed
on
that account. ...
George Barr called the council at
tention to some of the numerous, de
fective walks left since tb« building
of furb and gutter last year.
Dr. H. M. Bradley called the atten
tion of the council to the condi
tion of the Hawkeye jHgfrwaji lead.
Inife through the city. He claimed that
It was in poorer condition than ®hy
section of this highway, which pass*
ss through any of our neighboring
cities. He urged that the ground at
the foot ot West Main street, be made
more presentable. Dr. Bradley's pro
test created some discussion.
Orln Greenwood, W. A. Maurer,
Solon Hapjblin, Wm. Mciatosh and
others, appeared be|ore the council
and complained about t^e recently
constructed curb and gutter on East
Main street. They 'contended
Tjie soil in the'section which this
system will drain ia a deep black, loam
and when properly drained will raise*
immense crops.' The farmers^who are
installing: the system will spend a
large sum of mo^ey.but when the sur
flacg water is.once ctirried off, we'll
wager that it will take a fancy price
to buy that land.
A SUCCESSFUL CHAUTAUQUA

Iq securing eighty signers, guaran

they succeeded in this there is ne

Don Ignacio Calderon, Bolivian min
ister and leader in the movement to
prevent open hostilities, admitted to
the International News Service that
the situation looks hopeless. He said
that he had received authentic Infor
mation that the Carranza reply Is com
plete and that it is in no way respond

'The mob spirit seems to be in
fluencing General Carranza and, hin
advisers," said the veteran diplomat.
"While I have no details of the note,
I am assured through Latin-AmeH
can diplomatic sources that the reply.
Instead of being conciliatory, will de
clare that the United States is to
blame and will adopt a position which,
I fear, will leave no alternative to the
United States but to use force. We of
the Latin-American diplomatic corps
are gravely disappointed."

the reports from General' Pershlnf:
dealing with the Carrizal battle were
considered. t-
They showed conclusively, It Is un
derstood, that the allegations of the-'
Mexicans that the American troop*
commander was the aggressor are ab-v
solutely without foundation. Tteese
reports have been published In the 'ac
counts from the border.
Secretary Lansing reported that
practically all of the American refu

Mexico.
Meanwhile some 12,000 National
Guardsmen are on their way to the
border. Fully that number will go for-

this week. They will flu the gaps itf
