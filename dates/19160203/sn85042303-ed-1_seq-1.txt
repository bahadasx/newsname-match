The committee from the chamber

half of the gross production tax bill
I returned yesterday afternoon as no
faction on the bill will be taken until
, after the usury bill is disposed of. The
chamber of commerce will meet this
afternoon at five o'clock and a perma
nent committee will be appointed to
i go to Oklahoma City and remain there
until after the bill is disposed of.
j Those who have been there, stated
upon their return that things looked
good for their side of the controversy,
although it was meeting with bitter op
! position from senators who were from
J counties where oil w as not produced,
j how ever, they believe that when it
I conies to a vote, they will win out.
j Willi favorable action on this bill, it
'will mean much to Carter county,
which produces a great quantity of oil
annually, the tax derived from this
source placed on the roads would soon
i make permanent highways all over the
! county and would add greatly to the
! taxable value of outlying farm lands.
The chamber is very anxious to have
good men on the ground to agitate the
favorable passage of the bill, and at
the meeting this afternoon a suitable
committee will be selected.

AT THE CALLED MEETING YES- QUESTION HAS ARISEN IN CITY
TERDAY AFTERNOON THE
QUESTION OF ISSUING BONDS
WAS DISCUSSED.
At the called meeting of the board
of city commissioners yesterday after
noon no action was taken toward Is
suing a call for a special election to
vote on the question of issuing bonds
for street purposes, and the matter re
mains in Its former state. The ques
tion was pretty thoroughly discussed
however, but no definite plan for fu
ture action was decided upon. The
mayor was called away early In the
session, on business to Dallas, and
nothing further will be done until he
returns.
The mayor and commissioner have
advar.ced several plans to tide over
the present situation, but no definite
action has been taken on any ot them
up to the present time. It was report
ed that the street gang was laid off
the first of the month, but superin
tendent Howell stated this morning
that they were still at work as he bad
received no orders to suspend opera
tions and until he did receive them, he
would continue to work as usual.
ADMINISTRATION CIRCLES IF IT
WOULD NOT BE ECONOMY FOR
CITY TO OWN POWER PLANT.
Liven tip your Tusroet try th
Want Ads.
The question of the city installing
their own electric power plant at the
city lake for the purpose of pumping
city water and discontinue using power
from the Ardmore Ice, Light and
Tower Company has been frequently
discussed by the city administration
of late, and the mayor and commis
sioners are seriously thinking of taking
the matter to the people for their judg
ment of the proposition.
One of the commissioners stated
this morning that the city was paying
the Ice, Light and I'ower Company ap
proximately five hundred dollars per
month for power and at that rate it
would be but a short time until the
city could install a plant of sufficient
power and soon have It paid for. An
other question that Is receiving serious
consideration is the incinerating plant
to dispose of the city garbage.
""Commissioner London hasmade a
thorough investigation into this mat
ter, and slates that for $5,000 a plant
can be installed here that will dispose
of all city refute and that there were
parties who wculd gladly pay enough
for the by products of this plant to
"Slick" Fielder, tried and convict
ed in the federal court here for In
troducing liquor and sentenced to
IS months in the federal prison at

bond pending a decision of the circuit
court of appeals, has been placed In
jail at Texlco, New Mexico, and will
be brought back here and turned over
to the federal authorities by Officer
Dow I!razel, who leaves for the man
tonight.
Fielder was tried and convicted.
He appealed his case to the circuit
court of appeals and furnished bond
for his appearance, local parties be
ing surety for him. Pending the
decision of the court he skipped and
has been on the dodge ever since.
His case was affirmed and the sure
ties wanted him badly in order to
save themselves, and they placed Bra
ziel on the job to get the man. lie
was traced to Memphis last week, but
was about six hours ahead of the
officer when he arrived. Officers all
over Ihe country were notified to be
on the watch for him, anil this morn
ing the local officers were notified
that their man was in the jail nt
Texico. Mr. Ttraziel will leave for
that place tonight, get the man, hnd
turn him over to the federal authori
ties. The local sureties have spent, sev
eral sleepless nights since Fielder's
disappearance, as they stood to lose
$:i..-ft0 if he was not apprehended.
'Fielder was convicfed of introduc
ing liquor in this city. He was a
well known character about town,
and since he has been nt large it
is alleged that he has been running
contraband "dope" into the state from
Mexico.

Little Hock, Ark., Feb. 3. Two hun
dred persons are still In peril at tho
town of Gould, In Desha county, twen
ty miles below Pine llluff. The Ar
kansas river Hood, pouring through
the breaks in the levees, engulfed
the little town, which is several miles
from the river, and the residents
were driven to the roofs of their
homes. The message said that if
help did not arrive today It would be
too late. The water was said to be
sweeping through the town so fierce
ly that no small boat could survive
in it. A special train carrying a bi
gasoline launch was sent out from
Pine ltliiff. The train will go as
far as possible and then the rescuers
will set out in the launch.

lias been disposed of, as that Is the

The condition of Judge C. M. Camp

little hopes are entertained for his
recovery. He has been suffering for
several days with a severe attack of
lagrippe, and his advanced age makes
his condition all the more serious.
Judge Campbell Is one of the best .
known citizens of the state and has
been a resident of this city for many
years. His many friends will leara
with regret of his serious condition,
and sympathize with the family. All
are hoping for a chance for the better
today, and that he will fully recover
his health.
