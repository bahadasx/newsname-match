"As I look at that flag I seem
to see many characters upon
It which are not visible to the
physical eye. There seem to
move ghoptly visions of devot
ed men who, looking to that
flag, thought only of liberty, of
the rights of mankind, of the
mission of America to show
the way to the world for the
realization of those rights.
And every grave of every
brave man in the country
would seem to have upon It t ho
colors of the flag If he were a
true American wculd seem
to have on it that "lain of red
which means the true pulse of
blood, that patch of pure white
which means the peace of the
soul.
"And then there seems to
rice over the graves of those
men and to hallow their me
nvn'cs that blue space of the
hkv, in which swim those stars
which exemplify for us the glor
ious galaxy of the States of
the Union which stand togeth

mankind." Woodrow Wilson.

BERLIN. Feb. 3. The capture of
the British liner Appam and raids on
British lnoustrial towns and Paris by
Zeppelins and the fresh activity of
submarines, it is believed, may be
accepted as the prelude of an ag
gressive campaign on sea and in the
air against Germany's1 enemies.
It is hinted that the German sea
and air forces may perform even more
startling feats than they have hither
to accomplished. It Is the plan to
use Zeppelins in destroying food and
everything of military importance to
England as long as England keeps up
l.er policy of starving German?.
Officials here also declare that it is
impossible to consent to any new reg
ulations In regard to submarine war
fare until England changes her star
vation policy. Zeppelin raids on Eng
land have been impossible for several
months because of the nature of the
air currents. Experts now say the
conditions are ideal for aerial raids.

APPAM IS
WAR PRIZE
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, I). C, Feb. 3.
Stcretary Lansing announced today
that the Bri ish liner Appam, which
was captured by German') and
brought to Norfolk, is a prize of war,
according to tho official view of the
V. S. government.
Two points are at issue, the dispo
sition of the ship and the refusal of
Lieutenant Berge to release British
soldiers whom he insists upon tho
r'.ght to hold as prisoners of war.
It is expected that the government,
will observe the Prussian treaty oC
1820, which allows either country to
tiike prizes into the other's ports.

at the said Roberts from a six-gun.
The Khooting occurred on Chickasha

In this rase the defendant was rep-

FOLLOWERS OF GROUND HOG DON'T
AGREE ON DATE OF APPEARANCE
(By GEO. H. WYATT.)
Beginning early yesterday morning,
shortly after the first crack of day,
in fact, the sun shone forth with a
most dazzling brilliancy. Casting
aside the draperies of the night from
about his perron, the sun climbed
from his couch and smiled upon the
face of the earth and the snow en
crnstments melted and fell aside be
fore that sti'ile, even as the coy
msiden melteh and smileth and
wilteh when the bashful swain sum
mons up his courage to ask, "Wilt
thou?"
And there was vceping and wailing
and gnashing of teeth in the camp of
the believers in the ground hog as
i weather prophet. Cot. Barefoot,
Judge Venab'.e, Councilman McKr.y
and numerous others mourned and
would not be comforted because the
sun shone and the winter is destin
ed to abate not for the next six
weeks.
"Walt o time in patience," counsell
ed Judge Venable, "it is early yet and
let us pray that the little rascal it
sleep'ng, that he may not awaken un
til late in the day and that by the
time he does awaken the sun will
have hidden his face behind some
nearby blanketing cloud?"
But no such thing happened. Tho
sun was very much in earnest about
tbining out on the particular day of
the year. As each succeeding minute
joined itit predecessor, rolling up into
li'virs, the sun climbed higher and
higher aloft into the bosom of the
azure heavens and the snow upon the
streets liquified more and more rap-

mpper. After tbe reassembling of
the jury in their consultation room
the case was considered until 11:15
o'clock last night, at which time an
agreement was reached and a verdict
found. At no- time, according to
statements given out this morning by
jurors, did the jury question the guilt
of the defendant, the only question to
be decided, following the first ballot,
being the punishment.
After the verdict has been returned
in open court this morning, Judge
Linn thanked the jurors for the con
scientious manner in which they had
each labored in the interests of the
enforcement of the laws during the
past few days, or while serving on the
jury, and ordered the discharge of the
panels for the term.
No more jury cases will be tried at
this term of court. All cases which
will require a jury will be reset a:
an early date to some future term.
The court w'ill probably reconvene at
a jury trial term some time during
the month of March. In the mean
while motions and non-Jury case.-:
ready for disposal will be heard' dur
ing the remainder of the week by the
court sitting in chambers.

on the early morning train from El
Reno, where they apent. yesterday
afternoon as guests of the government
of that city, and of thei El Reno fire
department, in witnessing the test of
the auto fire engine which El Reno
has just purchased and installed a:
a cost of $'J,0flO.
The test, the Chickasha . officials
who visited El Reno, stato was a hard
one and proved perfect. The engine
responded to every call until the
fourth line of hose was laid and then
the El Reno water mains proved in
adequate to meet the demands.
Councilman Hays, chairman of the
fire committee, stated this morning
that representatives were present at
the test from Chickasha, Kingfisher,
Oklahoma City, Anadarko and other
cities. Also representatives of the
insurance rating bureau were present.
Mr. Hays further stated that im
mediately following the test the repr-;-sentatives
of the rating bureau com
menced the work of rerating El Reno
and that a statement was given ouc
by the member of the bureau that the
rates in El Reno's business district
would probably be reduced in a to
tal sum of approximately $2,300 the
first year. The statement was also
made, Mr. Hays said the reduction for
Chickasha, should this city see fit to
modernize its fire fighting equipment,
would possibly run to not less than
M.500 per year.
"Chickasha needs a modern fir.?
equipment." said Mr. Hays. "It can
only be a short time at most, when
the fire insurance department will
compel this city to modernize the
ecuipmnt and pay cash for it, and It
seems to me to be in the interest of

matter will be taken up at the next
regular meeting of the city council,

System of Giving Credit for Home Work
Produces Gratifying Results, Declares
CaLrtrnia County Superintend

BRINGS PARENT AND

Dignity of Labor is Learned by Pupils;
Children Who Fail in Books Become
Proficient in Doinj Practi

Yv'lLLOWS. Cab. Feb. S.No Iornrer
do the boys of Glenn county schools
protest violently at taking their regu
lar Saturday night bath No longer
do the girls mope and complain be
cause tired mothers call on them to
wash the dishes. The family kind
ling is being split with regularity and
dispatch and the coal box Is always
full.
This near-millennium for the houBe
wife is the result of thb system es
tablished by S. M. Chaney, auperin
tendent of the county schools, of giv
. ing credits to pupils for activities
outside of the classroom, especially ,
their home activities. The system haj
been in operation for six months and
still is in the experimental slag',
out it has accomplished more than
its Inventor ever dreamed it would.
Prof. Chaney outlined these results
In a statement ur the United Press
today, which follows:
"In the installation of the method
of allowing credits for outside ac
tlvtt'wj, M1 .' mnd several pur-,
poses. Ferhaps the greatest benefit
we expected to derive from the plan
was to bring into closer relationship
the home and the school
"By thia method we hoped; to gei
the teacher more interested in what
the pupils were doing at home, and
likewise to get the parents to under
stand a little better what was be
ing done at school. Another Idea wa
to impress upon pupils the import
ance and dignity of labor.
"I find morn good coming from this
method than I had hoped. When the
boys and girls find that the teacher
is really Interested in what they do
at heme and talks to them about
:nanv seemingly little things connect
ed with their home life, they vegin
to regard their teacher aj a friend.
Thus the possibilities of that teacher
are increased many fold
"Then tl: boy or girl who finds it
almost impos sible to learn things that
are in books, and who are sometimes
led to feel they are a failure, but who
can do things with their hands, are
encouraged when they are given cred
it in their standing at school for doing
these things.
"In tho short time we have been
trvins this plan, I have had many
mothers thank me for the idea, say
ing that heretofore it was almost as
bard work to get the youngsters to
do chores and assist with the work at
noma as to do it themselves, but that
since credit is given at school for
these things, the work Is done cheer
fully and (better. Many girla who
did not wand to assist with the cook
ing are now anxious to learn so they
may be able to prepare a meal by
themselves.
"Not only has the work been im
proved, but hygienic conditions an
better. From a feeiing of personal
pride a pupil does not want to bring
in a 'credit slip' showing he has not
bad a bath for two or three weeks,
neither do his parents wsn such a
showing. The same thing applies
to several other items in the credit
llprtc.
"We have been trying out this pl.".n
for about rix months. We shall prob
ably have occasion to modify the ap
plications of the principle somewhat,
but I p.m sure the general Idea is cor
rfct. The amount of credit to ba
given for this ort of activity mutt
necessarily be limited, that is. It must
not be allowed to assume undue pro
portions in its relation to regular
school work, and at the present tirra
we place the maximum amount at i
per cent, but as the plan Is as yet in
the experimental stage, this may be
charged later on Each rupll i given
