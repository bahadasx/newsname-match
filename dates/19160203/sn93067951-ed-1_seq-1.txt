A Weekly Review
Of The Great War
Another week has past and
still the Teutonic and Bulgarian
armies show n?? signs of moving
on Salotrica. On the contrary,
it is reported that the 10,000
A natiin.OA?iv,. ~ ? I- - I- - -1

occupied Monastir on the Serbian
side of the Greek frontier
have been withdrawn because of
the difficulty of keeping up communications,
since the only railroad
from Monastir runs to.Sa'Jvnca.
The French and British
at Salonica are therefore able to
continue their work of fortifying
the hills about Salonica without
int*?ruption except from the flying
visits of the aeroplanes.
One of the most remarkable
y
campaigns in the war is that of
which the outside world has
heard the least, the British invasion
of Mesopotamia. General
Sir John Eccles Nixon, who
I was in command first, secured
I the head of the Bersion Gulf and
ft the oil field to the north and
A then dispatched two expeditions
B into Turkey, one up the Tigris
M ana the other up the EuphratesH
The former under General Townfihend
had got to the ancient
Persian capital of Otesiphon last
November and London was expecting
to hear it had reached^

Bagdad,only twenty-five miles 11
away, when it was met and de-li
feated by an overwhelming force ?
of Turks. The British beat a;

retreat, down stream a hundred
miles to Kut-el-Amara, a posi- '
tion on the northern side of the 1
Tigris which the Turks had entrenched
but had failed to hold, '
as the British advanced up '
the river. Iiere General Town- '
abend was compelled to stop.and
wait for enforcements to dome 1
up the river, for he was envel- I
oped on all sides by a force of 1
Turks said to number 00,000 and <
commanded by German officers. *
The British troops are probably s
less than 40,000. Two British 1
gunboats which tried to reach
the besieged garrison were stop- t
ped by the shallow water. The a
Turks were well provided with r
artillery under cover of which c
they made repeated attacks up 1
on the British trenchs. On 1
Christmas day they managed to s
eff ect an entrance on the north- f
ern side but were driven out
with heavy losses. / c
The relief expedition under c
General Aylmer came up the e
Tigris to Sheik Said, an Arab | f
village about twenty miles be- i
low lvut. Here they found the t
Turks entrenched on both sides c
of the liver, but disloged them t
on January 11, and pushed on t? c

a battle took place last week in
a heavy rainstorm. The losses
were heavy on both sides and
victory is uncertain. If the re- 1
lief expedition can break there 1
the Turkish ring and the two I
foreeR unite, the advance upon 1
Bagdad may be resumed, for it '
ihould be easier for the British <
to get supplies up the river from <
die Persian Gulf than for the I
Turks to get them from Oonstan- i
;inople, for the German railroad
irobably lacks at least three <

Wilson Speaking
On Preparedness !
President Wilson has taken
e stump and has this week
ide a number of speeches outling
his position on the ques>n
of preparedness.
A brief synopsis of his stateent
is here given.
President Wilson, speaking,
he said, "solemnly." is warng
the nation that the time
ay come when we cannot both
iep the United States out of
ir and maintain its honor. Lie
iclared that the country must
i prepared to defend itself and
epared at once.
"America is not afraid ot any
>dy," he said. "1 know I reset
your feeling and the feelg
of all of our citizens when I
y the only thing I am afraid of
not being ready to perform
y duty. I am afraid of the
mger of inadequacy; I am
raid of the danger of not being
>le to express the chief characr
of this country with tremen)us
might and effectiveness
henever we are called upon to
;t in the field of the world's af,irs."
The President is speaking with
ore gravity and force than he
is shown during any of his preious
addresses on preparedness.
"Let me tell you very solemn
r you cannot postpone this
ling," hj declared. "I do not
now what a single day may
ring forth. I do not wish to
iave you with the impression
rnt 1 am thinking of some parcular
danger.
"1 merely wish to tell you
lat we are daily treading
midst intricate dangers. The
angers that we are treading
ruongst are not of our own makig
and not under our control. I
link no man in the United
tates knows what a single
eek, a single day, may bring
>rth."
"It is very difficult for us to
old off and look with cool
ldgment upon such tremendus
matters. It has not been
isy for the Government at
Washington to avoid these enmglements
which seem to best
it on every side. It has needI
a great deal of watchfulness
id unremitting patience to do
>.
"You have laid upon me this
ouble obligation. 'We are rering
upon you, Mr. President,
> keep us out of this war, but
e are relying upon you to keep
le honor of the nation nnstaind.'
"You- may count upon my
eart and resolution to keep you
ut of the war, but you must be
jady if it is necessary that 1
lould maintain your honor.
"We are interested in knowlg
that there are men all over
lie United States prepared,
[pupped and ready to go out at
lie call of the National Govern
lent upon the shortest possible
otice. You will ask me, 'Why
o you say the shortest p ipsible
otice?' Bdcause, gentlemen,
it me tell you very solemnly,
on cannot alFord to pospcne til ie
hing. 1 do not know what a
ingle day may bring forth/'

Better Railroad (
Facilities at Cheraw
Rumors have been in circulation
for some time to the ell'ect p
that changes for the better were (.
scon to be made on the Chester- s
field and Lancaster Railroad. t
Nothing very definite could be
learned of the origin of these ^
stories or of the real intention of
the railroad in question concern- ?
ing the matter until last Satur- |
day when information was given
out by Senator G- K. Laney that v
he had received a proposition j
from the Seaboard indicating a
willingness on their part to run jthe
O. & L. tracks into the Sea- i
I
board station at Oheraw. t
It seems that Mr. Laney had j
introduced a bill in the senate j.
to require all the roads concern- ^
ed to build a union station in ^
Oheraw. f
The Seaboard has made the counter-proposal
that if Mr. Laney
will withdraw his bill de
manding the union station thev <
will voluntarily connect the C. 1
& L. with the Seabord in the <
manner described. I
Mr. Laney says he would like
to hear from the people of the
county on the subject before ac
cepting this compromise.
