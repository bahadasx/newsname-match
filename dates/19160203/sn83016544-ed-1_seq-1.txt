DESTROYED DY FIRE
A. S. Carlson, of Dig Day, Low
Home Last Saturday.
A. S. Carlson, of Big Bay, had
the misfortune to lose his residence
and its entire contents by fire on
Saturday, the 29th. He had gone
out to assist in shoveling snow op­
posite the Bernt Jaoobson residence,
about a quarter of a mile distant,
to open the road for the stage that
day. He supposed that the fire was
out when he left, and when he re­
turned later in the day it was to
find that his home was in ashes and
nothing was left to him but the
olothes he wore. He lost all his
household goods, supplies, clothing
and relics and about |25.00 in
cash.
It is supposed that the fire caught
from the stove pipe near the ceiling.
He is now staying temporarily at
the home of Theodore Olson. His
neighbors immediately started to
raise a purse to assist him in rebuild­
ing and about $50.00 has already
been contributed.
Mr. Carlson is one of the pioneer
settlers of Cook county, having
come to Grand Marais about 30
years ago. He has been a public
spirited citizen and has done much
toward opening up the resources of
the county.
Deputy Sheriff, John Jabobson,
has charge of the subscription list,

be permitted to dance until after
the grand marGh. Maskers are en­
titled to the floor until then. The
library board are not persistent so­
licitors, though representing a most
worthy and increasingly useful in­
stitution they hope tor liberal pa­
tronage of this, their only dance
event of the year. They promise
you a good time. Dress up and
oome.
Go to the Drug Store for Valen­
tines next week.
Don't forget the big dance 011
Saturday night.
One of Herman Helmerson's cows
presented him with twin calves a
short time ago.
The band boys will give a dance
in the Happy Hour Hall on next
Saturday night. Special music will
be provided and a good time is as­
sured.
Ed. Nunstedt is now engaged in
constructing a school house at Fin­
land on the Alger line. Albert
Gilbertson and George McCoy are
assisting him. This is the third
school house built by Mr. Nunstedt
in Lake county this winter and he
expects to complete it in about two
weeks.

Tie Road Problem
On account of the immense snow
fall this winter the matter of keep­
ing roads open and passible is a seri­
ous problem with which the authori­
ties haye to deal. It appears that
this duty rests entirely on the shoul­
ders of the several town boards,
as to this duty there has been some
misunderstanding, some of the town
representatives assuming that the
county, is solely responsible for the
condition of all state roads, includ­
ing the removal of snow therefrom.
As the entire lake shore road Con­
sists of state roads, and as this also
is the mail route through the coun­
ty, the duty of keeping it open is at
the present writing exceptionally
important. Under the law, it ap­
pears, all state roads are constructed,
maintained and kept in repair by
the county, but the cleaning up of
snow blockades is not covered by
this general duty because, by a
separate statute passed in 1913, it is
made the duty of town boards, so
far as funds are available for the
purpose, to keep all highways pas­
sing through their towns in a passi­
ble condition by ^the removal of
snow therefrom. No exception be­
ing made, this provision applies to
state highways, as well as to county
roads and town roads.
Some of the towns claim to be
handicapped by a shortage of funds
for the purpose. In vjew of the
movement launched recently for an
exclusively overland mail service,
the necessity of which is now under
investigation, it may be very unfor­
tunate if at this time the stage ser­
vice is crippled by bad road condi­
tions. It behooves us, therefore,
not to be easily discouraged from a
diligent ($£ort to 'cope with thfj em­
ergency.
A Kindly Word to tho
Different Town Officials
It seems to be the prevailing idea
that the towns have nothing to do
with the keeping of State Roads
open for travel in the winter, Now
this a mistaken notion as the law is
specific and that they shall keep the
road open. It should also be the
prevailing willingness of all good
citizens that have teams to let them
go out on this very necessary work.
A man that will not let his team
out to help keep the road open in
winter, should certainly not have
any consideration as to summer
work for his team.
Now as to the present method
of keeping the roads 111 good travel­
ing condition in winter some might
differ with me until the following
idea is tried out. Each town should
supply themselves with a rollev ten
or twelve feet long, six feet in dia­
meter, and drawn like a common
field roller, and the road should be
rolled with this to a width of about
tixteen feet. This would tend to
make a ridge in the center and
would smoothen it out so the snow
would not fill in as it does now
when ploughed with a snow plow.
In plowing a road a ridge is formed
on either side and it is dug out in
the center making a fine place for
more snow to settle in with every
passing wind, the more snow the
more ploughing and the higher the
ridge at the sides. My opinion is
that in the future the rolling of the
snow roads will be as necessary in
the winter as dragging the muddy
roads in the summer. Hoping that
this will be tried out in another
winter and in the meantime do not
forget to keep the roads open this
winter as it is the only way we have
to travel lor the next two and a half
months.

SEPARATE PEACE FOR
BELGIUM IS URGED
London, Jan. 23.—An Amsterdam
dispatch states that the Frankfurter
Zeitung, discussing the possibility of
a separate peace between Germany
and Belgium, says that as long as
Belgium has not signed the London
agreement regarding the making of a
separate peace she is free to do as
her interests ^command. The news­
paper is quoted 'aa adding that Bel­
gium until now has been considered
by the German chancellor as an ob­
ject of exchange and that sensible
Belgians ought to be told not to wait
too long or Belgium will be consider­
ed as a good prize.
The Amsterdam dispatch says that
this article has caused a sensation in
Germany and that it is believed to
have been inspired from official
sources.

Asa Hoyt has already made up bis

tbe ground is frozen and the snow is too

Arthur Saylor was at the post-office

N. P. Parsons has made up his mind

Mel Green attempted what is believeif
suicide by jumping out of a shade tree

Chas, Peterson took out his moose*

The rabbit, however, had a good start of
