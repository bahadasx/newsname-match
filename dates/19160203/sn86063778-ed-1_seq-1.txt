LOCAL SCHOOL BILL
BEFORE LEGISLATURE
Below is printed the bill introduced
some days ago in the
legislature by Representative
W. R. Bradford, the passage of
which is expected to give the
Fort Mill graded school a full
nine months' term without
tuition or other fees. If the bill
should pass, and it is fully expected
that it will, it will not,
however, become effective until
1917. The bill follows:
"Section 1. After the approval
of this Act, the County
Auditor of York county shall
levy and the County Treasurer
shall collect annually one mill on
the dollar of the assessed value
of all property within Fort Mill
School District, of York county,
for the purpose of paying the
interest and retiring at maturity
the bonds of said district heretofore
issued in aid of schools
therein, and six mills annually
for the maintenance of the
schools of said district: Provided,
That if at the expiration
of ten years, it becomes apparent
that the amount accumulating,
as such sinking fund, will not be
sufficient to retire said bonds at
maturity, the said levy shall be
increased to such amount as will
prove sufficient therefo-, an 1 the
levy for the maintenance of said
schools shall be proportionately
decreased.''
Worked Hard for Winthrop.
Says a Columbia special of
Tuesday to the Rock Hill Herald:
J. T. Liles, chairman of the
ways and means committee of
the house has sent the following
telegram to Dr. D. B. Johnson,
president of Winthrop College:
"I "feel impelled to wire you
that Bradford has made a magnificent
fight for the new dormitory.''
W. R. Bradford, a member of
the ways and means committee,
made a strong fight in the committee
to have an item of $100,000
included in the general ap
propriation bill. He lost simply
because the committee had determined
upon a policy of not
attempting any large undertakings
at this session. The
way seems well paved and action
will very probably be secured at
the next session.
However. Mr. Bradford and
the other members of the York
delegation have introduced a bill
in the house, and senate to provide
for the dormitory. Just
whether this bill will pass r< mains
to be seen. The bill has
been unfavorably reported in
the House.

APPROPRIATION BILL
GALLS FOR LESS MONEY
In keeping with a resolution
passed the first day of the
session, the ways and means
pommitfpp of fhpctnto )nrri<ln*-iifo
lias effected a considerable
saving to the people of the state
in practicing economy in making
appropriations. It is not believed,
however, that any of the
departments will be crippled by
this use of the pruning knife.
The appropriation bill was
introduced in the house Saturday
by the ways and means committee,
and it is said that the
bill will call for a state tax levy
of six and one half mills, against
a levy of seven mills last year.
All expensive undertakings were
excluded from the appropri.it ions
allowed.
The appropriation bill carries'
about $2,378,000. The various
institutions and departments of
the state government asked fori
$3,124,000. The special taxes,
raise about $400,000.
JNo provision was made in the
bill for a new dormitory at Win-'
thr??p college, all building projects
being eliminated by the com-!
millee. It was expected that
a fight would be put up in the;
house to have additional items
inserted but it was thought that
the bill would pass substantially
as it was introduced.
The House Friday morning
killed the bill by Mr. Moore, of
Abbeville, to define the liability
of various corporations to theiemployees
on a yea and nay
vote of 34 to 31. The bill was
on third reading and the motion
to recommit was carried after a
strong presentation or arguments.

GOODE'S DAYS NUMBERED
ET UtftTK SENTENCE
Israel Goode, a seventeen-yearold
negro boy, was Monday
found guilty of the charge of
criminally assaulting a white

seek to refute the testimony.
The arguments were begun and
at 1:51 the judge completed his
charge. At 2:00 the jury returned
and announced a verdict
of guilty.
After sentencing the negro,
