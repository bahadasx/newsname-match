touched land ubout 200 miles south of

ness and impairment of vision. The
State Hoard of Health is charged with

ing n teacher for this instruction, with
out charge to the institution, and it is
understood that the State Hoard of
Health is very willing to undertake
this educational work. The bill will
not carry an appropriation.

LANCASTER ROBBER CAUGHT
The identification of "J. W. Grant"
as J, W. Rice, a resident of Lexington,
was accomplished by the detectives of
Lexington late Friday afternoon.
After a long cross examination,
"Grant" confessed, according to Chief
Drown, that he was J. W. Rice, and
that he lived with his wife in Forest
Hill ut 820 Whitney avenue. He said
ne came there from Chuttanooga two
yeais ago.
The detectives say they believe that
they have established his connection
with the robbery of the safe in the
Louisville Nashville railroad station
and the burglary of McRoberts' drug
store hero at Lancaster last Wednesday
night, and the dynamiting of the sufe
in the L. L. Roberts' Furniture Com
pany of Lexington, lust summer.
The ticket ugent, Mr. Kirk, at Lan
caster, and the conductor on u Louis
ville & Nashville train were ut police
station Friday afternoon and accompan
ied the detectives to the county jail of
Lexington where Rice is confined. Mr.
Kirk, agent, stated to Chief Drown
that Itlce was the man who bought a
ticket for Lexington from him Thurs
day. The conductor stated that Itice
came to Lexington on his train that
morning from Lancaster. A sample of
soap ued in cracking the depot safe
was declared to be identical with the
large lump in the Kit,
The syringe and "dope" pellets found
fn the kit in possession of Rice when
arrested were identified by the detec
tives us Btolen from McRoberts' drug
store fn Lancaster, Chief Brown stated
that Rico has nevei denied complicity
in the robberies mentioned, but when
pressed with the accusation stated,
"Well, chief, you caught me with the
goods on in this Refining Company af
fair, so why worry about any others?"
Mrs. Rice visited her husband Satur
day morning in jail, lie said to a Lead,
er reporter Saturday that he felt very
badly. Physicians have visited him
since his confinement.
BIG CROWD IN
TOWN MONDAY.
Although the weather was what
might be called "unpropitious", to say
the lea.t of It, last Monday, the crowd
was one of the largest ever seen In
town. Every one was In a good humol
and made the best of a steady down
pour as well as mud and slush. Livery
stables did n land office business, as
every stall was full to over flowing.
while buggies and nutomobiles lined the
squsre and streets. Truly, Lancaster
looked like a metropolis and took care
of her visitors In a WBy that did her
proud. Come to see us again and the
oftener you come the better you will
like us. Amcrig the many happy
hearts that left town Ollie Koyse'a was
the happiest while James Dalton's was
a close second.
THE LAW WITH
THE BjlRK ON IT.
Many of our subscribers ask us each
dsy why wo do not publish a list of the
prizes that have been drawn at the two
contests recently held In our town.
ouch matter has been declared unmail
able by the authorities at Washington
and Postmaster Hrown has had his in
structions in very plain language from
llicse iowers that be.
Section 574 of the Postal Laws of
1913 says:
'Newspapers and other publica
tions in transit which contain lot
tery advertisements or lists of
prizes drawn at a lottery, shall be
held and a report made to the As
sistant Attorney General for the
Post Office Department forinstruc
tions .
Now this is the law with the 1 ark nn
it and Is the reason why we have never
published in detail a list of the drawings.
PROUD OF OUR
COURT HOUSE.
The work of remodeling the Court
House having been completed in the
most satisfactory manner, those who
will occupy offices in it are moving In

their new and beautiful quarters. The
first door on the right is that of Sheriff
Tom Ballard's, tin second door on the
right is the office of Circuit Clerk, Joe
A. Burnside, then comes County Clerk
Will Hamilton's office. On the left,
first door, is that of County Attorney.
G. C. Walker, on the same side, the
County Judge and Fiscal Court rooms.
Our court house had long needed re
modeling and repairing and now that it
is completed it is a thing of beauty and
will be the joy and the pride of our
county for years to come. It is more
commodious, is steam heated, well
lighted and ventilated, and the offices
together with the whole building are in
keeping with the time and place in
wuitu we live.

SUPERVISOR BOGIE RESIGNS.
I Accepts Posiliou With Culvert Company.
I Mr. John Bogie who hus been the
Road Supervisor for Garrard county for
I the past two years resigned this office
I lust week and has accepted a position
with the Newport Culvert Company, of
Newport, Ky., and nssumed his duties
, lust .Monday morning. This is a very
lucrative job. paying $1,800 a year and
his expenses. Mr. Bogie is admirably
fitted for the position and his friends
are proud of his promotion. His family
will remain In this city, as Mr. Bogie
will be on the road all of his time, but
I hopes to run in home every week.
, The resignation of Mr. Bogie will
I cause the appointment of his successor
and there is much speculation us to who
the lucky man will be. The position of
Road Supervisor is one of the most im-
'portent in the county, requiring thought
and experience, beside which a rigid
examination must be passed to obtain it.
County Judge C. A. Arnold makes
the annointment. which must 1m mtEHpil

applicants for the place and we trust u
good man will be chosen.

OVERCOME BY GAS.
Mrs. Steve K. Vuught, of Winches-
ter, was overcome by gas fumes and
found unconscious in the bath room of
her apartments last Monday, and for a
time it was thought she was in a serious
condition. She remained unconscious
for several hours. Mrs. Vaught enter
ed the bath room about noon and had
the gas turned very high and it is sup
posed that she was overcome very sud
denly. Friends called sever times over
the telephone and getting no answer
went to Investigate, and their timely
arrival probably saved her from death.
A WISE MEASURE.
A bill has been introduced in the
Kentucky Legislature to reduce the
number of pre-emptory challenges in
felony cases. This measure has had
the endorsement of the County Attor
neys Association and also of the Com
monwealth's Attorneys. It is a meas
ure which The News has always favor
ed. The large number of challenges
now granted the accused without cause
are not used to secure a fair and im
partial trial, as the best men summoned
for jury service are the ones excused,
in bud cases. They ure used generally
to get the worst jury possible in hopes
that by this means, if an acquittal is
impossible, that one or two men can be
found to hang the jury. Ifthenumber
of challenges are reduced the number
of guilty men who escape will be re
duced, but no person on trial for a
crime will have any of his just rights
taken from him, nor will the probability
of his conviction, if he is innocent, be
endangered. The change in the law
has always been defeated in the Leg
islature by a number of crimnal lawyers
in the Legislature who made their
money by defending criminals and
whose success is marked by a number
of guilty men they are able to acquit.

THE UNIVERSAL CAR j 111
EX-GARRARDITE
Celebrates Serentj-Six Anniversary.
A few of the older citizens of this
city will remember with pleasure Mr.
James W. Ramsey, formerly of this
county, but now long a resident of
Washington, Ind. He was an intimate
friend of Mr J. W. Pumphrey and was
his "best man" at the tatters wedding
nearly fifty years ago. Mr Ramsey
now ranks as one of the leading citi
zens of Washington and the following
from the Washington, Ind. Herald, at
tests his popularity:
"The beautiful home of fjames W.
Ramsey, city councilman and revered
civil war veteran, was the scene of an
enjoyable gathering Saturday night
when his charming wife, to celebrate
her husband's seventy-sixth birthday
anniversary, entertained the city coun
cil. Mayor McCarty, and a few invited
friends.
An impromptu program of toasts fol
lowed the serving of an elaborate sup
per, Mayor McCarty. in his usual pleas
ing manner, presiding as master of cei
monies. The responses, brief but to
the point, werelprofuse in congratula
tions to the honor guest, whose resi
dence in Washington since 1872 has
made him one of the city's most honor
ed and prominent citizens. As a climax
for the evening, Mayor McCarty pre
sented Mr. Ramsey with a gold-headed
umbrella, the gift of his colleagues in
council. Mr Ramsey's response, de
livered with an emotion that indicated
a deep feeling, was most appropriate."
