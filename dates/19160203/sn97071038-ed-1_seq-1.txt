Cumniercial Club Will M'ork to Di
vert Waters of Ditch Creek Into
Willow Creek Basin. Club
WU1 Hold Membership Ral
ly and Smoker,
Through the efforts of C. A. Minor
and other interested farmers of Wil
low creek, the Heppner Commercial
Club has taken up the work of put
ting through a ditch which will di
vert the water from Ditch creek, near
the upper end of Ditch creek prairie,
Into the Willow creek basin. The
new ditch will' follow the same sur
vey that was made a few years ago.
Mr. Minor estimates that the work
can be done for about $200 and he
will give $25 for the ditch. He is of
the opinion that this additional wa
ter In Willow creek will be sufficient
to supply farmers for irrigation the
year around, and believes that the
residents along the creek will give
liberally to the enterprise, since it
will mean so much for them. Upon
motion, president Wllktns appointed
C. A. Minor, L. E. McBee and L. M.
Turner as a committee to raise funds
and put the ditch through. These
men will have the assistance of the
executive committee and work will
probably start as soon as weather
conditions In the mountains will per
mit. At the regular meeting of the Club
last Friday evening, Secretary Sniead
was instructed to inform the Port
land Chamber of Commerce that the
local organization would stand ready
to pay a reasonable assessment tow
ard the payment of expenses incurred
by putting the Smith-Jones Irrigation
bill before Congress. S. E. Notson,
in speaking of this bill, said that it
would be the best thing yet done for
irrlgationlsts, inasmuch that the forty-year
bonds would be Issued by the
government, instead of individuals
as in the past, and the man who takes
up land on the projects will "be given
the best of terms permitting him to
give the land an opportunity to pay
for Itself.
The question of membership and
dues was taken up by the Club and
discussed at length. The plan pro
posed by a special committee the
previous work was finally looked up
on with disfavor and It was decided
to place the membership fee at $1.00'
per month, allowing the various bus
iness houses to take out as many
membership cards as they saw (It.
For the benefit of farmers and non
business men, such as clerks and
other wage earners, the fee will like
ly be put at fifty cents per month.
In order to get the membership com
mittee started off right, additional
members consisting of T. J. Ma
honey, M. D. Clark and J. F. Vaughn
were appointed to assist In the cam
paign which will be inaugurated at
the smoker and feed to be held in
the dining room of the Palace hotel
next Tuesday night.
The "feed" committee, Oscar Borg,
C. L. Sweek and Dr. R. J. Vaughn
have been busy the past few days
making preparations for this event
and they announce arrangements
have been made to handle a big
crowd. Since matters of importance
to the entire county will come up for
discussion at this time, the Club has
extended an invitation to all citizens
to attend. The program will open
at 6:30 when the "eats" will be
brought on. A charge of fifty cents
per plate will be made by the Club.
Kills Mad Coyote In House.
Standing on the bed on which lay
his wife and child, H. M. Spencer, a
Wasco rancher swung the butt end
of a shot gun against the snarling
jaws of a mad coyote and stunned
the beast, then beat It to death with
a club.
Spencer, who has a place about 5
miles northwest of Wasco, was awak
ened Friday night by the barking of
his dogs. Going outside with his
shot gun he found the dogs grappling
with a coyote. Spencer fired and
missed. Then the coyote headed for
the door of the Spencer cabin. Spen
cer beat him to it and fought the an
imal from the bed.
The head of the coyote was sent
to the State Hoard of Health which
replied by telegram that the coyote
had rabies. Spencer has killed his
two valuable dogs which fought the
coyote.
This Is the first case of rabies re
ported In Sherman county. Grass

Dry Salt Cured Hams.
Dry-salt hams and picnics should
be closely trimmed, and then sprin
kled with a solution of sugar and
saltpeter before treated to the salt,
explained Wm. Constantino during
his interesting meat-cutting demon
stration at O. A. C. The salt should
be thoroughly rubbed on and the
meat stacked In a suitable receptacle,
where it should remain for two or
three days less time in warm mur
ky weather and then be taken out,
new salt rubbed on, and repacked in
a different position. This process
should be renewed for a period of
about sixty days, gradually lengthen
ing the intervals of three days to five
or sixand so on to the end of the
peiod. The pieces are then taken
from the salt and well-smoked. If
well prepared the meat will keep
well arid" also have a tendency to re
tain its best flavor and to brown
nicely in frying.
Stiles Comes to Grief.
Rev. eon Stiles, preacher, insur
ancj..hi utfluquaworker and
what not, has finally run amuck in
California. Stiles is accused of beat
ing the insurance company for which
he had worked, jumping beard bills
at various towns and also obtaining
money under false pretenses. Rev.
Mr. Stiles got in bad several years
ago with the Christian church in
Colorado and after being ousted from
the clergy, took up other lines of
business as mentioned above. He was
in Heppner last June selling insur
ance and local people learned of his
methods to their own loss and sor
row. The newspaper report says' that
he is also In bad with the Ellison
White people for whom he had work
ed at one time.
Loses I'm in Home by Vint,
Coming as the second calamity to
'visit a Morrow county farmer within
ten days and of the same nature, was
the fire which destroyed the home of
Walter Drumm, on his mountain
ranch near Parkers Mill. The origin
of the fire is unknown. Mr. Drumm
was In Heppner at the time and re
ceived word of his loss by telephone.
George Glass of Clarks Canyon re
cently lost his farm home in the same
manner, and like the Glass lire, Mr.
Drumm lost a large store of provis
ions which were in the house. Com
ing In the middle of winter, the blow
is a severe one to Mr. Drumm and he
will not be able to rebuild before
Spring.
At the Christian Olwrcli.
Rev. T. S. Handsaker has returned
from Baker where he held a success
ful meeting which resulted in 47 ad
ditions to the church in that city.
Regular services will be held Sun
day when the pastor will take for his
morning sermon the subject, 'Pre
vailing Prayer." Sunday evening
evangelistic services will be held, al
though the subject of the evening
sermon has not yet been announced.
Whs Similar 30 Years Ago.
Thirty years ago this winter, Dep
uty Sheriff Willard Herren drove a
six-horse team across the Columbia
river with a load of wheat. Accord
ing to him, the present winter comes
the nearest to being equal in severity
of any winters which have come and
gone since then.
Helps Children to School.
W. D. Mikesell has been assisting
the many children who live up in
his neighborhood, to school during
the deep snow and every day now he
may be seen carrying several boys
and girls over the deep mantle in his
big wagon.
We have taken up on our farm 3
miles below Heppner 16 head of hogs,
for the most part sows and pigs.
Owner may have this stock by paying

PERU
Morrow County Fair Board Would Have Annual Show Main
tained By a Half-Mill Tax Which Would Raise Sufficient
Funds Each Year to Make Local Fair Best in State.
The year 1913 marked the opening
of the First Annual Morrow County
Fair and after the gates had closed
following a strenuous three days
spent by fair officials, exhibitors and
visitors, the unanimous opinion was
that the county's first fair was a big
success. The next year the fair
board purchased land and erected
buildings of their own and' the an
nual affair was launched forth on a
larger and more comprehensive scale.
The purchasing of grounds and the
cost of erecting buildings has placed
the Morrow County Fair Board in
debt considerable and the future out
look for the fair is not bright, ac
cording to the fair board, unless
means are devised for raising more
permanent funds for Us maintenance
and growth.
The Board has finally decided that
the most equitable plan on which to
conduct the fair in the future is as
follows:
By levying a half mill tax on the
taxable property of the county, the
sum of $6,000 may be raised.
The fair can then be thrown open
to the public each year entirely free
of charge.
By the half mill tax, sufficient
funds may be raised to extend the
Heppner High School Placed on Accredit
ed List of Case School of Applied Science
Supt. Hoffman has been corres
ponding with Pres. Howe of the Case
LSchool cX Applied Science, Cleveland,
Ohio, relative to having Heppner
high school placed on the Accredited
List of that institution. Last week
he received a letter from Pres. Howe
saying that this- had been done.
Case School of Applied Science Is
one of the foremost technical schools
in the United States and the require
ments for admission to its Freshman
class are as high as any college or
university in our country.
Some students of Heppner High
are thinking of taking engineering
courses at Case.
For the first time since 1903,
Heppner is this week cut off by rail
road or telephone communication
from the outside world. The local
train failed to make its regular trip
down the branch line Wednesday,
and had it made the journey, there
would have been no through trains
to connect with It there according to
railroad officials. Both East- and
West-bound trains have been held
up by the deep snow and as a result,
very little mail has reached this city
the past few days. Postmaster Rich
ardson says that Monday's mall, us
ually light anyway, consisted of only
two sacks when under normal con
ditions it is made up of about seven.
At the time of the Heppner flood
in 1903 the railroads, telephone and
telegraph wires were out of com
mission for several days, but this is
the first time in years that deefl snow
has caused such a tie-up in railroad
transportation.
According to Andy Cook, a pion
eer resident of this county, this is
the largest fall of snow he has ever
witnessed here for one continual
storm. He predicts the snow will
drift and pile up many feet deep in
the canyons before the storm finally
abates.

The Board contends that after the
second year the tax can in all proba
bility be reduced to a quarted of a
mill.
. President E. R. Huston, of the
Board, in speaking of the proposed
plan, states that the farmers in his
vicinity, In the Eight Mile section,
with whom he has talked are heartily
in favor of the measure.
Secretary Smead says that It
should appeal to the farmer inas
much as the tax would amount to far
less than that which the farmer and
his family would spend in paid ad
missions to the fair during the three
days.
The Fair Board, collectivpiv nnri
individually have assumed the re
sponsibility of the debt which now
nangs over tne county fair, but since
the fair is a county institution, the
Board feels that every taxpayer of
Morrow county should feel equally
interested in the success of its opera
tion. In order that the proposed tax levy
may be voted upon at the May elec
tion,, petitions will be circulated at
an early date.

AGAIN IN SIGHT
Ira M. Morgan, recently of Glen
wood, Wash., was in Heppner this
week looking over the field with a
view of establishing a creamery In
this city. Mr. Morgan's proposition
has been taken up by the Commercial
Club and will be gone into thorough
ly before Mr. Morgan's return here
next Tuesday. Mr. Morgan's plan is
a simple one, and as he outlined it to
us, the total cost of putting in the
plant would not exceed $1500. He
would organize a company, taking
some of the stock himself and put it
on a co-operative basis. Mr. Morgan
has a family and will make his home
in this city should the creamery be
established. He is a son of M. R.
Morgan, of lone, is a graduate of the
Oregon Agricultural College and has
had several years ot practical exper
ience In the creamery business. He
had charge of the creamery at Inde
pendence for several years and has
had previous experience in the work
of organizing creamery companies.

OREGON PIONEER DEAD
Oregonian.
Due to an illness of 10 days
brought on by an attack of acute in
digestion, Mrs. Maria Sweek, Ore
gon pioneer of 1853 and one of the
earliest settlers of the Tualdtin Val
ley, passed away at midnight Friday
at the old family home at Tualatin.
Death came rather unexpectedly in
spite of the fact that Mrs. Sweek was
nearly 83 years old and had been a
sufferer from heart trouble for 15
years.
Mrs. Sweek was of Missouri stock
and was born in Genevieve County,
that state, May 31, 1833. Her maid
en name was Beard. In 1852 she
married John Sweek. With a colony
of more than 100 families the young
couple set out overland by oxteam
train for Oregon in 1S52. The
Sweeks made this strenuous journey
a "honeymoon celebration," and in
the Spring of 1853 they settled on a
donation claim at Tualatin, where
the family has made its home ever
since. ,
Mr. Sweek died In February, 1890,
but the widow preferred to remain
at the old homestead to coining to
Portland, where some of her children
lived.
In all the 63 years of the residence
of the Sweek family in this state, the
founders of the family are the only
two members that have died. All
six of the children and scores of
grandchildren and great-grandchildren
survive. The children four
sons and two daughters are: Cy
rus A. Sweek, an attorney of Burns,
Or.; Mrs. Milton W. Smith, wife of
a well-known Portland attorney;
Lawrence Sweek, a stockman,, of
Monument, Or.jAlex Sweek, prom
inent attorney and Democrat, of
Portland; Mrs. Lillie Harding, of
Tualatin, and Thad T. Sweek, Mayor
of Tualatin.
Calvin L. Sweek, an attorney of
this city, is a grandson of the deceased.
PREPAREDNESS IS
CHEAPER III END
Sjeech of the Hon. James R. Mann,
Republican louder of the Honse
of Representatives in Congress,
Tuesday Afternoon, Jan. 23.
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, In the
quietude of my garden last summer
and autumn I reached certain conclu
sions which I have hesitated to ex
press, thinking that I might modify
them. But as time has gone on and
events have occurred It has seemed
to me more certain that my conclu
sions were right than even when I
first reached them, and I think, in
justice to myself, and I hope with
some slight benefit to the country, I
ought to express those conclusions
to the House.
It is well known in the House that
I never have been a believer in a
large standing Army, and I suppose
that I have been probably properly
classed in what 13 sometimes . re
ferred to as the "little Navy men."
But wise men ought to be able to
peer, maybe Indistinctly, into the fu
ture, and to prepare 'today for what
may come tomorrow. The world Is
in the most remarkable anomalous
condition which mankind has ever
seen. The greatest struggle of all
the ages is going on now between the
most powerful forces of the human
race, between great nations and com
binations of nations, until we are the
only large, powerful nation not yet
involved In that struggle. It is a
breakup in the world, each side not
merely fighting for its own existence,
as it believes, but, as it seems to me,
each side fighting with the determin
ation to put the other side, as it
were, out of business. We have never
had such a thing in the world before,
with the same powerful influences at
work.
The laws of civilization, interna
tional laws, the laws of humanity,
axe uually--disrgardedr at - least
more or less, when two great forces
are fighting for mastery. With two
men fighting, each believes that he is
fighting for his life, each determined
to take the life of the other, neither
pays much attention to the desires,
the requests or demands of some less .
powerful person not engaged In the
conflict.
I do not know, ana no one knows,
what will result from the present
war. Io one knows whether the ag
gression of one side or the other
against our interests, may possibly,
against our desires and contrary to
our wishes now, finally lead us, per
haps not into this struggle but into
some struggle which is the outcome
of this one. I doubt whether a
paper peare between the two strug
gling parties now, even if it could
be entered into, would be even the
beginning of the end. I think the
present conflict is likely to last for
many years before it Is definitely de
termined either that one side or the
other is the master or that neither
can become the master. And it seems
to me that the part of wisdom for us
is to fairly prepare ourselves for any
possible trouble which may come.
(Loud applause.)
It may be that we will have no
trouble. I hope not. In this war I
am neutral. I think we ought to
maintain peace at all hazards. And
yet the time may come when we will
not have the determination whether
we can maintain peace or not, be
cause, however much we may desire
peace, it is not within our power,
with the feelings which we have, to
stand aggression too far. It will be
expensive to prepare for peace. Two
years ago a billion dollars seemed a
very large sum of money. No one
would have believed two years ago
that either England or Germany
could carry on a war at the expense
already involved, amounting to bil
lions of dollars, an expense so great
that the interest on the indebtedness
would be sufficient ordinarily to
maintain the Government work. And
the end of that indebtedness is not
in sight. What may come out of
such immense burdens of debt in
these countries even when peace may
be declared, no one can tell. Revol
utions are not improbable, and revol
utions in the history of the world
have usually lead to aggression ami
disputes, and often to war with other
countries. We can better afford to
day to spend hundreds of millions of
dollurs, or a few billions of dollars,
in ample preparation for trouble, and
avoid it if possible, than we can to
wait for trouble and then spend un
told billions before we are finally vic
tors, as we would be. (Applause.)
If we are involved In no trouble wo
will be getting off cheaply with the
expenditures for preparation. If we
should be involved iu trouble the
money we spend now will be worth
manyfold that which we would spend
