I "America is not going to abide the
habitual or continual neglect" of its
I rights under international law, either
with respect to the safety of its clt
Uens or its foreign commerce.
"For one thing, it may be neces-
eary," the president said with a
gesture "to use the forces of the
United States to vindicate the rights
,of American cltliens. everywhere to
; enjoy the rights of international law.
1 "We must also Insist on the rlghta of
I Americans to trade with the world," ha
continued. "We hall respect any
blockade, but the world needs the prod
ucts of the United Ftates. and we will
Insist that the world seta thorn."
f The Philippines, the president said,
would be freed.
'That flag; will come down," he con
tinued, "when we feel that the Philip
pines can take over their own affairs
and no longer require our protection, and
it wilt be more honored In the lowering
than in the raising."

tertain the audience while waiting; for the

"American is a composite nation. Many

WITNESSES TELL
WHAT GUTTERY DID
Inquiry Into Conditions at Norfolk
Hospital Brings Out Alleged
Immoral Conditions.
ANXIOUS TO AVOID SCANDAL
NORFOLK. Neb., Feb. 2. Ne
braska State Board of Control today
began public and official investiga
tion of conditions at the state hos
pital for the insane in Norfolk.
The hearing follows an investiga
tion conducted by the Norfolk Dally
News several weeks ago. At that
time the state board removed Dr.
W. D. Guttery, superintendent, from
office and asked for his resignation.
He demanded a public hearing.
Mrs. Nina Hickerson, who re
cently voluntarily left the employ of
the Norfolk hospital as a nurse, tes
tified thai on one occaajon Dr Gut?
tery put his-arm around, her on the
stairway, and she struck him in the
stomach with her elbow. She named
one woman whom she said bore an
Immoral reputation, and declared
Dr. Guttery told her that he was
warned about this woman by her
own relatives before employing her.
She said that Dr. Guttery told a
clasa of women nurses that "most
men lose their manhood at 45, but
I'm 63 and Just as good as ever."
She told of a suggestive story which
she said be told the class.
P. F. Garvey, former deputy county
clerk of Boone county, testified that
when he went to work at the hospital
Dr. Guttory told him, 'girls will be
girls." and that he wanted employes to
have a good time, "but If you pull off
anything-, don't let it get to be a scan
dal." Ho named nuraes whose moral
reputation waa bad, he aald.
Reads Story He Told.
Garvey read an obscene story which
he said Dr. Guttery told a mixed claaa
of men and women. He corroborated
Mrs. Hlckerson'a story as to Dr. Gut-
tery's claims to vitality, adding; that Dr.
Guttery aald he kept in condition by eat
Ins egg's and drinking milk.
Garvey resigned three weeks ago and
testified Guttery In trying to persuade
him to sign a statement of recommenda
tion for the state board, promised im
mediate promotion, and aald: "Now will
you sign it," and Garvey said he re
fused.
Miss Lease, head nurse for six years,
testified that on one occasion a female
patient threatened to harm , the 'nurses,
and while Dr. Guttery looked on, one
nurse conquered the patient, after which
Dr. Guttery "strongarmed" or choked
the patient. She said she thought he waa
too severe. Miss Lease told of another
female patient who was put on a bread
and water diet for two days by . Dr.
Guttery to ' discipline' her. She named
five former nurses of Immoral reputation,
and aald Guttery had talked to her about
their reputations, but retained them In
the employ of the hospital.
Mies Lease aald Guttery told her he
employed one woman agalnat the wishes
of his wife on account of her reputation,
and stated that she Was bright and he
"could excuse anything but a lack of
bartna," and that he wanted to give her
a chance because he thought It -would
help her.
I'artlal to Good Looks.
She told of another woman who, ac
cording to Cutlery's statement to the
witness, told him of her past Immorali
ties, but he said she was large and pleas
ing in appearance and he thought ahe
would make a good girl If given a chance.
Mlsa Lease testified she received a re
port of the profanity of one woman, but
did not report It to Vt. Guttery because
ahe thought Guttery partial to this
woman, which, ahe aaid, was the general
Impression. She said shs had gone Into
nurses' rooms when they were til and
found Dr. Guttery there; that she found
him sitting on the edge of the bed In the
room of a woman of immoral reputation,
although there was a chair in the room.
She told of seeing one of tbeae nurses
walking ami in arm In the tunnel with a
male patient.
Judge Good sought to bring out atate
ments from witnesses thst the patients
were well treated, wcil fed. clothed, etc.
Miss Lease mid slid had never seen any
cruelly and considered I r. tiuttcry kinS

The manifesto declares that the Brlt

paying heavUy for their Ignorance. It
urges a reconstruction of the school sys

"The nation's auooess now and la ths

"He answers by monosylllbles snd I
doubt whether he pronounced to any

an Id's of the confidential mission en

Wilson to take the trouble to deny such

in Each Distriot
WASHINGTON. Feb. !. Repreaenta
tlves of the executive commute of tbe
National Guard association continued be
fore tbe house military committee today
arguments In behalf of recognising the
organised militia as the main atrength
of the countrya first Una army. General
W. F. Sadler of New Jersey said that If
congress would provide for the organisa
tion of the guard on the basts of 140 men
for every congressional district, the force
would total 20,000 on a peace footing,
which could be readily doubled for war.
General Sadler said tho annual total of
a militia pay bill would be about $3.G50.0OO.
Estimates on the continental army, he
added, ranged from $40,000,000 to $0,000,000.
General Sadler Insisted that guardsmen
went Into the service because they be
lieved thay would be sent to the front
In case of war. and If they were
now superaeded by a continental army,
he was certain he could not retain SO par
cent of his present force ninety days.
