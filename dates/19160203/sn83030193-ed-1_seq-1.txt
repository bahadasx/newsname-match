KAST HT. 1XHJI9, Keb. 3. Tho last
word of President Wilson to the

day won a rlnglnii cry for 1he greatest
navy In tho world. "Tho navy .C th
United Slates," lie said, "should bo

tho world,"
The Inland States of thn Mississippi
Valloy have shouted unanimous ap
proval to all tho President's sugges

led him finally to proclaim In confi
dence the policy of America, the sov
ereign of tho sea.
Prcsldont Wilson dashed in and out
of St. Louis this morning. Groat
throngs wolcomed him In the early
dawn and sped him on his way at
noon with whirlwinds of cheer. Not
oven a respite for a quiet breakfast
was given him. Klvo hundred of tho
city's foremost men sat down with
him for coffee. To thorn ho made a
ten-mlnuto address, more about busi
ness than nbout preparedness, win
ning tholr loud approval for a ro
newod confession of chango of mind
about a tariff commission.
As tho President entered his auto
mobllo nt tho Twentieth Street en
trance of tho Union Station a small
dark-halrod woman rushed to his sido
and thrust two letters Into his hands.
She was seized by detectives and
taken to Police Headquarters. Tho
letters wero found to bo religious ex

sist in simplifying religious doctrine.
Tho pollco said sho had no weapon.
