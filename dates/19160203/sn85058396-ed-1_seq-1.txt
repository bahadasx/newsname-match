LINER APPAM STEAMS UP STREAM
I AMID CHEERS OF BRITISH SAILORS
.
MU Newport News, Va., Feb. 3. When
M the former British liner Appam lifted
H her anchor off Old Point Comfort
H I early today and proceeded up the
H Names river to Newport News, there
Mi : -was much activity among 244 persons
Hii who had been held prisoners of the
9, Germans and who have been granted
1 jthe right to leave the ship. They
EM were anxious to get ashore and get
9 ! started on their way to England,
B : ' where they were bound when the Ap-
B ' -pam was captured.
H Pending a further decision by the
Hi state department as to the status of
Bl more than 200 others aboard the Ap-
Hf pam, theBO persons faced a longer con-
Hl' finement on the steamer. This de-
Hl clslon was anxiously awaited by all
HI but the members of the German prize
Hi, crew because of the Indications that
HI the government would rule the Ap-
Hf pam was a prize of war belonging to
HI Germany.
Hi Captain Harrison Detained.
H Captain Harrison of the Appam was
H ' detained aboard with all the mem-
H bers of his crew, the Germans rav-
H ing raised the point that the show of
H 'resistance they made when captured
H h forfeited their right to be liberated.
H .Twelve British subjects described by
H Lieutenant Berg in a telegram to Am-
H ! bassador Bernstorf f as "enemy sub-
H f I jects," also are to be kept aboard the
H : 'Appam. These men are believed to be
H .gun pointers removed from vossels
destroj'ed by the raider.
H : It is the German contention that
H . the Appam came into Hampton Koads
H under the terms of the Prussian-
H . American treaty which guarantees
H ; her to her captors. The British view
H ' is that the vessel should bo returned
H to her owners as a prize in accord-
H ance with article 21 of The Hague
H : convention.

m t British Cheer Appam.
S ; It was shortly after 9 o'clock this
i morning when the Appam got up an
M '- - cho'r and steamed away from Old
W'i Point Comfort, where she had been
M ; lying. She steamed slowly by Hamp
9 ton roads, passing several British
M merchantment as she neared Point
jjB Breeze. Loud cheers were exchanged
9 by the crews of the freighters and
3 ' the Englishmen on the Appam. The
H ' freighter saluted with three resound
H ing blasts of their whistles.
Hi Berg Makes No Response.
H Lieutenant Berg on the bridge made
Hi ' no response with the whistle of his
HI prize. I
H The, Appam anchored in the James.
H; Immigration Officer "Williams board
s' ed the vessel to pass upon the per
il i sons desiring to land. He wns ac
H companied by British Vice Consul

II troubles might otherwise . prevent
II them from landing.
I While passengers fretted over their
II inability to get ashore the six mas
II ters of the English vessels captured
It by the German raider, took a tug for
It Newport News.
It1 Collector Hamilton submitted a
II ! memorandum to Lieutenant Berg, the
HI prize officer, requesting the release
HI along the lines indicated, and the lieu
It; tenant said that he would comply
Hi with it.
Hi "You will release," the memoran-
H dum said, "from the steamship Ap-
H pam all those persons who desire to

Hi "Is this the decision of your gov-

GREAT GLEE IS
FELT IN BERLIN
II
II Cruiser Moewe Enrolled on
It Honor List With the Emden,
It Prinz Eitel and Karlsruhe.
I
Hr Berlin, Feb. 3, via London, 12:15
H p. in. News of the arrival of the Ap-
11 pam at Norfolk and of the daring
Hi) raids of a German cruiser In the main
Hi lane ofl sea traffic between South
HtJ Africa and Europe has aroused a new
Hll outburst of enthusiasm for the navy.
Hrj The cruiser Moewc in English, the
Hi Seagull was enrolled immediately
Hk upon the honor list with the Emden,
Hjj Prin Eltel Friedorlch and Karlsruhe.
Hk There is no little mystery here rc-
H (garding the identity of the Moewe.
Hf Admiralty officials evidently were not;
W: (Surprised at the news, but for obvi-
Hj ous reasons decline to give any infor-
H znatlon.
H' I A vessel named Moewe is given in
tho German navjr list as a sun'eying
ship. She formerly was engaged in
survey work at the East African sta
tion. It seems improbable that this
little steamer of 650 tons, with a
speed of only nine knots, could accom
plish the exploits in question.
It may have been that some larger
steamer, assuming the namo Moewe,
when converted into an auxiliary
cruiser, slipped through the British
hues.
The German survoying ship Moewe
was sunk by gunfire on August 9,
1914.
NEW STORY OF
GERMAN PROWESS
Fast Cruiser Roon Reported at
Large in the Atlantic As
sisted in Sinking Ships
Washington, Feb. 3. Secretary
Lansing stated today that there was
no question as to the Appam's stat
us as a prize, but that the question
of her disposition still Involved fur
ther consideration of The Hague con
vention and the Prussian-American
treaty. Lieutenant Berg's refusal to
land British seamen who were gun
pointers on British merchantmen will
be the subject of further considera
tion Possibility that a still more formid
able German sea raider than has been
reported the fast cruiser Roon is
at large in the Atlantic and the re
port that the Roon in fact was near
by and directed the operations, of
the raider, called the Moewe, which
sunk six ships and captured the Ap
pam within two hundred miles of the
coast of Spain, promises to add an
other chapter to the yet untold story
of the daring of German sailors.
The Roon is a fast, heavily armored
cruiser of nearly 10.000 tons, with
more than 18,000 horsepower, 400 feet
long and with both oil and coal boil
ers. She was built at Kiel in 1902,
has four funnels and extra high wire
less masts. She carries a Krupp ar
mor belt, four torpedo tubes which
give discharges forward, astern and
broadside and mounts 28 guns in all,
four S.2 inch, ten 5.9 inch and fourteen
3.4 inch.
The British embassy denies it has
information that the Roon is at large
and was reported off the Canary
islands, but the story that she accom
panied the Moewe is accredited to
British aboard the Appam.

GROSS OFFENSE
AGAINST AMERICA
Frankfurter Zeitung Makes
Vigorous Objection to Charg
ing United States With
Perfidy.
VEILED THREAT MADE
i
Writer Hopes No Breach of Re
lations Will Occur, But Ger
many Stands Ready
to Fight.
Frankfort-On-The-Maln, Feb. 3, via
London, 1:45 a. m. The Frankfurter
Zeitung, whose utterances on certain
subjects are regarded as Inspired,
publishes an "article in which vigorous
objection is expressed to the lone
adopted by the press of Berlin n dis
cussing Secretary Lansing's note on
submarine warfare and the arming of
merchantmen and in particular to tbe
statements made in Berlin that the
proposals are inacceptable to Ger
many. It dissents from the position
taken by the Kreuz Zeitung and Pro
fessor von Stengel that Germany has
no interest in negotiations regarding
the freedom of the seas since Eng
land, with America's assistance, is
only using the negotiations to wrest
from Germany's hands her submarine
weapons.
Gross Offense to U. S.
To this the Zeitung rejoins:
"It is a gross offense, not only
against international law but against
the most elementary conception of
good morals, to charge openly that
the United States, with which Ger
many is not at an enmity, Is putting
forth efforts in the sphere ot interna
tional law merely with the perfidious
purpose of helping England."
The newspaper also condemns
sweeping generalizations drawn from
the Baralong affair and regards It as
"disgusting" to make capital out of
the incident, as if it were typical ot
Gxeat Britain's method of (making
war or as if the British government
caused all German seamen who were
captured to bo murdered.
Lusltanla Case Unsatisfactory.
Turning to the present status of the
Lusltania case, the Zeitung says it
cannot be ignored, that tho negoila--,
tions have taken an unsatisfactory
form. "Apprehensions of this kind,''
it says, "must exist in America also,
as Washington evidently intends to
dispose of the Lusitania case at the
I same time as the general question of
submarine warfare and is using the
J Lusltania case to obtain Germany's
' consent on the general question."
It hints that this is a very objec
tionable procedure, Involving serious
possibilities.
: United States Threatened.
"That people in America are thlnk-
, ing of bringing the matter to a de
cision," adds the Zeitung, "Is evident
from the fact that Mr. Wilson has
sent Colonel House to Europe, pre
sumably to obtain information from
belligerents. We hope that no breach
of relations not to mention some
thing worse may follow between Ger
many and tho United States, but, if
the unexpected should happen, Ger
many will confront her new foe as
stoutly as she did the old. Bot we do
not want to be lulled by certain Jingo
heroes of the writing desk Into the
illusion that this foe is not danger
ous." The Frankfurter Zeitung then refers
to German's excellent military situa
tion and to the prospect that the mili
tary resources of the allies will be
exhausted and that Great Britain's
financial resources will fall. It con
tinues: "But all this might change sudden
ly and this is obviously England's
hope If the allies secured a new
helper, who would grant unlimited
loans and furthermore make contribu
tions of a warlike kind by supplying
our present enemies with all their
requirements in America."
The Frankfurter Zeitung concludes
by warning the German people that
they must consider the outcome of tho
war and that every other end, how
ever desirable, must be subordinated
to it

BATTLE SIGNAL
BOOK IS LOST
Washington, Feb 3. Naval officers
frankly admit they are alarmed at the
mysterious disappearance of the bat
tle signal book from the destroyer
Hull of tho Pacific fleet.
Admiral Winslow today reported
that all efforts to. find the highly con
fidential code book has been unavail
ing nnd naval officers said that it
probably would be at once replaced
by another to make useless the one
which has disappeared and which,
they admit, they fear may fall Into
the hands of some foreign govern
ment. Commanding Officer Arrested.
The battle signal book contains the
secret code used in war and in bat
tle practice in times of peace. The
copy on the Hull was In possession
of Lieutenant H. A. Jones, commander
of the Pacific reserve torpedo flotilla
and Ensign Robert D. Kirkpatrick.
Both officers have been court ninr
tlaled at Mare Island navy yard.
Navy officers express some satisfac
tion that the battle signal book and
not the secret code, which is used
when ships in foreign waters are com
municating with home, Is the one that
disappeared. The latter code is rec
ognized among nations as the best of
its kind in tho world and would be
difficult to replace.

CHEERING CROWD
St. Louis Coliseum Crowded
and 30,000 Overflow on
Outside City Employes
Given Half Holiday.
SCHOOLS ARE DISMISSED
Declares United States Navy
Should Be Unconquerable,
the Greatest Navy in
the World.
St. Louis, Mo., Feb. 3. President
Wilson today told an audience of 15,
000 cheering tumultously at his feet
that the United States should have
the greatest navy in the world.
"I advise, the navy of the United
States should be unconquerable," he
said, "the greatest in the world."
The president declared that subma
rine commanders abroad have instruc
tions which for the most part conform
with International law, but that the
act of one commander might set the
world afire, including America.
"Upon the ocean there are hun
dreds of cargoes of American goods"
he said, "cotton, grain and all tho
bountiful supplies America is sending
out to the Avorld and any one of
those cargoes, any one of those ships
may be the point of contact that will
bring America Jnto the war."
United States Really Neutral.
For the first time during the tour
tho president told of how one set of
belligerents was cut off from the
world. He said this kept the United
States from helping them as It would
like. Ho made the statement in try
ing to show that the United Stales
was really neutral.
There was an overflow of 30,000
persons on the outside while the pres
ident spoke in the coliseum.
,.S. Louis. Mo.,iFeb.-.3i-;-An-hour-be--fore
the time set for the president to
speak here today, the Coliseum was
crowded and the streets outside were
full. City employes had a half holi
day. All schools were dismissed for
the day. A school chorus of 1.500
tucked away in a corner of he hall,
sang national airs.
As the president entered the crowd
cheered wildly. The whole gathering,
with countless small flags fluttering!
stood up and sang "The Star Span
gled Banner," the president joining
in.
The president opened with the
statement that he had "come seeking
something in the middle west and
found it." lie said he had been told
the middle west was against pre
paredness but did not believe It.
"I did not come out to learn how
3'ou thought but to tell you what was
going on. I came out that there may
be absolute clarification of the issues
we are now confronting.
America Friend of World.
"America is at peace with all the
world because she is the friend of all
tho world. The friendship is gen
uine. We are the friends of all the
world because we are made up of all
the world and understand all the
world.
"We believe we can show our
friendship for the world better by
keeping out of this struggle than by
getting into It. I do not misread
the spirits of America.
"I have no Indictment of any form
of government.
"No man can lead America any
whither that her people do not de
sire to be led. I believe it to be my
duty to subordinate my individual
feelings to the conscientious attempt
to Interpret and express in these In
ternational affairs the .genuine spirit
of my fellow citizens.
Americans Disciples of Peace.
"So far as America is concerned,
no man need go among6t us preach
ing peace. Wo are disciples of peace
already and no man need preach that
gospel to us.
"Suppose my neighbor's house is on
fire nnd the roof is of combustible ma
terial, it is not my fault If the fire
spreads. The danger is not from
within, but from without.
Submarine Commanders.
"Tho commanders of submarines for
the most part are in accord with the
law of nations, but the act of one
commander may set tho world on fire.
"There are cargoes of whoat and
cotton and manufactured articles on
the sea and everyone of them may
cause trouble because they go Into
the zone of fire.
"America has drawn no fine points,
no now issues in her international re
lations; she has merely asserted tho
rights of mankind when the life of
mankind is threatened in a world
aflame with war. She has rested upon
what is already written plain on the
documents of international law."
Nations Will See American Justice.
The president said that some day
statesmen of the older countries
would have to admit that it was
America that kept burning the flame
of international law upon its altar,
when every other altar in the world
was swept by tho winds of passion.
"I am ready to make every patient
allowance," he continued, "for those
whoso tempers are upset by war.
"I am not in a critical frame of
mind, I am ready to yield everything
but tho vital points.
Makes Allowances for Both Slde3.
"I am ready to make allowances for
both sides.
Tou know hawr one. set -of bollig-l
orents is shut off from the rest of
the world. Therefore, the United
States is not able to express Itself
toward them as they would like. I
believo the United States is really
neutral.
"My fellow citizens, while we know
our own purpose, it does not follow
that other nations understand.
"Men press forward with a sort of
blind recklessness.1
Peace of the World.
"Tho peace of the world, including
America, rests with the remainder ot
the world and not with America.
"Here is the alternative:
"Either we shall sit still and wait
for the necessity for Immediate na
tional defense to come and then call
for volunteers who would be, for the
that few months, impotent as against
a trained and experienced enemy;
"Or, we shall adopt the ancient
American principle that the men ot
the country shall be ready to take
care of their own government"
Crowd Cheers President.
The crowd roared approval.
"You have either got to get the
men of this nation ready to withstand
the first onslaught, or you have got
to be ready to suffer from the first
disaster."
When the president said he was
only asking for a trained citizenship,
he was cheered. He said he did not
want to command a great army, but
to command the support of confidence
of his fellow citizens.
"The plans now before congress are
merely plans to save the lives of
American youths," he said.
"All those plans will go through.
"The modern fighting ship, subma
rine every instrument of modern
warfare must be handled by experts.
All we are asking for now is a suffi
cient number of experts and a suffi
cient number of vessels. There Is
no better service in the world than
the service of the United States navy
But the navy must have more ships
and we are going to give tho navj- the
ships it needs. We must have a pro
gram and then stick to it The navy
has a great task. No other navy has
such a task.
"We ought to have the greatest
navy In the world," ho declared amid
great applause. He explained that tho
coast line of the United States was
so long that many ships were needed.

- WH1CHISAGGEPTED
Arrangements for a wrestling bout
between Pete Yisser of Ogden and
George Nelson of Preston, Ida , were
virtually completed today, according
to W. L. Roe, Jr., of Preston. Mr.
Roe is Nelson's manager and came
to Ogden last night to witness the
Visser-Romanoff bout and to extend
the former Salt Lake fireman's chal
lenge to the winner.
Mr. Roe is manager of the Frank
lin County Citizen of Preston, one of
the most progressive newspapers of
southern Idaho, and through his in
terest in athletics was instrumental
in persuading Nelson to leave Salt
Lake City and locate at Preston. At
the present time, Nelson is manager
and instructor at the Preston gym
nasium and is keeping in constant
training for wrestling bouts when an
opportunity to meet a high class man
is offered.
According to Mr. Roe, his protege
has been keeping close track of Peto
Visser's work and, when the latter
closed his agreemet for tho bout with
Romanoff, decided that a match with
the winner of that argument would be
well worth his attention. Nelson is
also looking for a match with Joe
Stecher and his manager Is of tho
opinion that the winner of the pros
pective Nelson-Visser match will have
a good chance to meet the strong
easterner.
There is little question of Nelson's
class as a wrestler and with Visser's
firmly established through his victory
over Romanoff, a match between the
two should awaken wide interest.

D. D. McKay, of Huntsville, who re
turned from his sheep camp in tho
vicinity of Terrace this morning, re
ports that practically all of the herds
on the desert ranges are being sup
plied with corn and sheepmen expect
to prevent heavy losses by feeding.
The snow Is from 12 to 20 inches deep
and has drifted into ravines and low
places ten feet deep.
Only in a few places, says Mr. Mc
Kay, is the snow crusted. Sheep can
browse successfully on the ridges
where much of the snow has been
blown away,
A few days ago, Mr. McKay relates,
five hundred of his sheep and- the
herd dog were completely buried In
a snow drift and it was necessary to
dig them out The herd had taken
shelter in a hollow on the range when
a strong wind came up and blew the
snow so rapidly that tho sheep wero
covered before they could get away.
He says that when the snow was re
moved Borne of tho sheep were peace
fully chewing their cuds. However,
they would have perished in a- short

ticularly heavy in the vicinity of Neu
ville, where the Germans recently
made a considerable gain of ground.
English mine craters in the vicinity of
Ilulloch were occupied by German
troops.
The text of the statement follows:
"Western theater The enemy artil
lery has vigorously replied to the

grenades Into hostile trenches estab
lished at the northern end of Frlse.
"At about 11-30 o'clock this morn
ing the enemy attempted a surprise
attack aaglnst our trenches near
Ypres on the Pilkelm road. The at
tack was not preceded by an artillery
bombardment and was easily repulsed
by our fire."
Review of War Sttuation.
Expectation of another German at
tempt to blast a way to Calais, using
masses of infantry and artillery, is in
dicated by London press comment
Intense artillery activity along the
Franco-Belgian front reported in to
day's German official statement, may
presage another important offensive
movement in this field by one side or
the other.
Berlin indicates that the French
may have a plan in view to recoup
their losses of territory near Neuville,
which they sustained recently as their
artillery fire in this sector is report
ed as increasingly heavy.
The Germans are continuing their
submarine activities In the North sea,
according to a dispatch from The
Netherlands and report the torpedoing

PROSPECTIVE I
FLOOD I
Commissioner Chris Flygare, super- H
intendent of streets, states that he is H
making every preparation possible MM
to guard against floods in the city MM
and along the Ogden river that may MM
occur when the heavy snow begins to MM
Today men and teams are at work H
removing snow from street intersec- H
tions and gutters. So far, the gutters H
have been kept open only by remov- H
ing each layer of snow as it fell, which W
has been exery day the past week. H
Mr. Flygare states that there is so H
much snow that, if a sudden thaw W
came, it is questionable just how far MMt
the flood waters could be controlled H
The commissioner has arranged for IH
1000 sacks of sand to be placed at jmmM
convenient points along the Ogden H
river bank to be used in case the jH
stream should get so high as to threat- H
en an overflow. Tbe river bed has H
been dredged in a number of places jH
in the past two years and the banks IH
enlarged nnd strengthened. IH

temporaneous speaking, oratory, re- H
told story telling, male and mixed H
quartets and choruses. J
To determine the ward having the H

elation has a score-keeper whose duty H
Is to record the special features of tho H
preliminary programs of the weekly MmM
meetings. These records are mailed IH
to tho stake board once a month and IH
the points in tho contest are then IH
compiled. The plan has thus far giv- jH

tion to the presentation and accept- lH
ance of tho pennant, a violin solo by H
