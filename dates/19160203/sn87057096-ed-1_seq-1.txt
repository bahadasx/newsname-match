The railroad company is certainly

break in the dam repaired at great
expense. The recenty heavy rain and

only for the force of the water to

SEE ECLIPSE TODAY.
Partial eclipse of Sun Today—Begins
at 9:15 and Comes to Close
at 11:00 a. m.
There is to be a big free show here
this forenoon, the weather permit
ting. It will be a partial eclipse of
the sun, and if the sky is clear, the
phenomena will doubtless prove as
Interesting as if it were a complete
obstruction. As the show lasts about
two hours, there is no conceivable
reason why any one should miss
ana even the late risers ought to be
able to get out before the close. A
stargazer, who makes a specialty of
such events, writes as follows:
For about two hours this forenoon
a peculiar semi-twilight will cover
the middle west and the United
States. The sun will go into a total
eclipse, visible, however, in most of
the United States, only as a partial
eclipse. In this city it will appear as
partial.
The sun will begin to pass into the
shadow, as seen from here) about
9:15 and it will have entirely emerg
ed from the shadow by about 11
o'clock. The path of total eclpise
runs through northern South Ameri
ca and Cental America and on north
east through the ocean until it ends
near Ireland.
An astronomer's note on the eclipse
is as follows: A total eclipse of the
sun, Feb. 3, is visible as a partial
eclipse in the United States, Mexico,
and Central America. The path of the
central or total eclipse begins in the
Pacific ocean, moves eastward, cross
es the north portion of Colombia*
north of Caracas, over the island ol'
Guadaloupe, passes northwest of the
Azores and ends at sunset in the At
lantic ocean south of Ireland. The
most favorable places for observing
the total eclipse are in the islands of
Guadaloupe and Destrade, where the
duration of totality is nearly, two
and a half minutes. In the district
governed by Chicago time the eclipse
begins at 9:15 and ends at 1L:03.
If the day is cloudy, only the vary
ing light will indicate the eclipse. If
the sky is clear, the best way to ob
serve the phenomena is to smoke a
piece of glass over a lamp and watch
the eclipse through this. Some people
use the smoked glass in connection
with a pail of water using the water
as a reflector, thus dimming the di
rect rays of the sun in two ways. Nev
er try to see an eclipse of the sun
with the naked eye as eye strain is
sure! to follow.
W One on the Dog
Leon, Iowa, Jail. 28, 1916.
Editor Reporter:—I wish to thank
your for your editorial, not simply
because it commends my article- but
because I think it is of as much
value to our cause as the article in
question.
Your typesetter, probably on ac
count of my poor writing, failed to
catch the idea where he makes me
gay—"Do not "sick" or draw gore
on the man." Now I imagine draw
ing gore on a man would be a good
deal like drawing whiskey on a bar
rel. And the allusion to the poison
ed sponge that follows would be
CMfeVt BOIAM
Here is the idea: The farmer's
bull dog is named Drawgore. The
farmer sets Drawgore on the agent.
Drawgore seizes the agent by the
seat of the pants. Dogs use this
hold, exclusively, on agents.
A wise agent knows this and pads
his trouser seat with a sponge soak
ed in poison to kill the dog.
Respectfully yours,
A. M. Chrisman.
Who'll Do the Job For Us?
During the twenty-nine years we
have been editing The Reporter we
have written flowery obituaries for
hundreds of men and women, and
the thought has Just occurred to us,
which caused us to wonder who will
perform that duty for us when we
cash in our check. We have made
saints out of many a sinner, and
lauded men who even failed to pay
us for the paper they have read for
years, and we would just like to be
able to read what the fellow who
writes our obituary will have to say
about us. But we are hoping he
won't have to do it for several years
yet.
Time to Get Busy.
The presidential primary, which is
due in two months and a half now,
was cause for a special meeting of
the democratic state committee last
week. When it is considered that
for this primary fifty-two delegates'
and alternates' petitions must be fil
ed the same as for state candidates,
it is time to plan on getting things
ready, and this committee is doing it.
For county and district delegates
and alternates petitions must first be

can be printed on the primary bal

BUM CENSUS FIGURES
Figures Given Oat by Director of
Iowa State Census are Incorrect
and Grossly Misleading.
County auditor Walter Osborn haB
received the certified census figures
of the 1915 census from A. U. Swan,
census director in the state auditor's
office at Des Moines, and the Des
Moines papers have been publishing
his figures the past week. If they are
all as near correct as the figures re
turned to auditor Osborn for Decatur
county, they are absolutely worth
less, being both incorrect and mis
leading. The figures returned from
Des Moines show that Decatur coun
ty has a population of 17,148, while
the assessors" returns in the county
auditor's office show a population of
17,371, as against 16,347 for the
census of 1910. In the returns sent
from Des Moines which gave the pop
ulation of the cities and towns in De
catur county there are glaring inac
curacies. Lamoni is credited with a
population of only 778, while the
figures returned from that town to
the county auditor show a popula
tion of 1,991, and Lamoni sure has
a kick coming to have such figures
published.

Protested Change in Location of Post
Office.
It seems that trouble about the
Leon post office will not down, but
continues to bob up to disturb the
peace and tranquility of this city.
Last week the report was circulated
that a contract had been made for
the room in Geo. W. Baker's business
block on the north side of the square
at present occupied by Keller &
Pryor's millinery store, had been
leased for a term of years for the
post office and that it would be mov
ed. A number of the leading busi
ness men and citizens of Leon im
mediately got b.usy and' a lelegraur
was sent to Washington protesting
against the proposed removal which
was followed by mail by a big peti
tion. For many years Leon was di
vided by a bitter north and south
fight which was carried on to the
detriment of the. business interests
of the city, and the beBt business
interests of the city do not desire to
see a recurrence of this matter,
which has finally been dropped,
much to the satisfaction of every
body

In answer to a telegram of the
27 th instant, signed by yourself and
others, which the Postmaster Gen
eral has referred to me, protesting
against any action tending to remov
al of the post office at Leon to a new
site, you are informed that although
the case has recently been made the
Bubject of investigation with a view
to securing larger and better quar
ters if possible, a change in site is
not contemplated at this time. The
inspector has reported that two pro
posals were received, but the high
rentals demanded for the premises
precluded their favorable considera
tion. The owner of the room now
occupied declined to submit any pro
posal when advised £s to the De
partment's requirements.
Under the circumstances, the case
is considered as closed for.the pres
ent. ...

MUST GIVE FULL WEIGHT.
Dairy and Food Commissioner Insists
That The Consumer Must Get
What He Pays For.
It may have been unnecessary to
warn the Leon coal dealers, for it "is
believed that there has been no short
weight sold here in many years, but
while the state dairy and food com
missioner was at it, he sent notices
to all coal dealers in the state warn
ing them against short weight. The
letter follows:
Gentlemen:—Frequent complaints
of short weights are reaching the de
partment.. The inspectors have re
weighed many loads of coal and
found substantial shortages. Prose
cutions will follow.
There are several reasons for the
shortages. In some cases dishonesty
has been practiced. At times weigh
men have been been extremely care
ness. Wagons have been overloaded
and coal lost between the yard and
the place of delivery.
Short weights will not be tolerated.
Purchasers are entitled to receive all
the coal they pay for. The depart
ment must insist that coal be weigh
er more closely. The weighman
should break as close as ten pounds
rather than at fifty or one hundred,
as seems to be the practice in some
cities. Inspectors have found some
dealers receiving the advantage of
the breaks both on the gross and the
tare.

Do not overload your wagons. Driv

•Democratic Confeifwe at Creeton.
There was a conference of the dem
ocrats of the eighth congressional
distfirt held at Creston on last Fri
day, and several of the Decatur coun
ty democrats,.attended, expecting to
meet W. W. Marsh, the new national
committeeman, it having been an
nounced that Mr. Marsh would be
present, but he was called to Chicago
on business, and bis absence was a
keen disappointment to many who
attended this conference, as had they
known he would not have been there
they would not have gone. The con
ference was arranged and presided
over by chairman Reynolds, with the
aid and Assistance of Nick Reed, who
told him just how to run things and
who to call on for remarks, so you
can imagine the result. Reed is the
fellow who was kicked off the state
committee by his own district, the
Mxth, thefa managed to induce the
state committee to elect him chair
man, and when-he resigned he nam
ed Reynolds as his successor, and has
since tried to control the democratic
appointments in the
especially
in the eighth district. The quicker
the democratic party shakes loose
from men of the Reed-Reynolds
clique, the better it will be for the
party. Reed and Reynolds are re
sponsible for the appointment of a
republican as postmaster at Leon,
and democrats of prominence all over
the state have denounced their action
and say it was the rottenest deal ever
pulled off in the state.
The conference appointed a com
mittee of one from each county to
nominate candidates for delegates
and alternates to the national con
vention at St. Louis, and J. A. Brad
ley, of Centerville, and R. G. Welsell
of Corning, were selected as dele
gates and iieman C. Smith of Lamo
ni, and Dr. J. W. Coakley, of Creston,
as alternates. (Chairman Reynolds
was not named as a delegate.)
Received a Hard Fall.
Mr. Geo. P. Campbell, of Davis
City, received a very hard fall while
in Leon last Saturday, and for a
time he was in a very serious condi
tion, but is now getting along alL
right. Mr. Campbell was crossing
the street from Walker's restaurant
to the passenger station, and just as
lie stepped from the paved street to
the ground between the paving and
the sidewalk, he slipped and fell. Mr.
Campbell 1b a very heavy man, weigh
iuf 260 pounds and he fell with
great force, striking his head on the
frozen ground. He was badly dazed,
and persons who saw him fall assist
ed him to the depot and he returned
to Davis City on the evening train,
bt't after reaching his home he be
came unconscious and remained in
this condition for several hours. He
was considerably improved the fol
lbwing day and no serious resultsare
anticipated

Provided Program for P. E. O.'s.
The ladies of Chapter W, of the
P. E. O. society and their husbands
enjoyed the annual dinner party in
honor of the organization of the Leon
Chapter, which was organized twen
ty- six years ago, at the assembly room
of the library building on Tuesday
evening. One of their famous din
ners was served, and after a song by
a quartet composed of Mrs. O. M.
Gass, Mrs. O. E. Hull, Prof. O. M.
Gass and John Gates the entertain
ment for the evening was turned over
to the B. I. L.'s, the husbands of the
members, -and they put on a varied
program which kept the audience in
an uproar, as the gentlemen had
carefully guarded their plans and the
ladies had no idea of what was going
to be presented for their benefit.
O. E. Hull was in charge as direc
tor of the program and a long list
of noted artists were presented, thg
first being Paderewski impersonated
by J. R. Bowsher, and he had a make
up that was the real thing, arriving
in an auto accompanied by his valet,
and say, he put on some stunt, no
one ever dreaming that he was such
a musical artist. Next came "Blina
Boone," impersonated by P. F. Kopp,
and he was a dead ringer for Boone,
even to his unceasing body move
ment and his piano solos elicited
great applause. Then came Strict
land Gillihan, (Dr. B. L. Eiker) and
his humorous talk and an original
poem made a decided hit. Prof.
Kubilek (Dr. F. A. Bowman) played
an artistic violin solo, and as an en
core he played and sang "The Blind
Fiddler," and his audience showered
all the pennies they had with them
into his hat. Harry Lauder, the
Scotch ballad singer (Dr. H. R. Lay
ton) came in for his share of ap
plause, as did Prof. Arthur Castle
(L. P. VanWerden) in a graceful ex
hibition of the latest tango, fox and
turkey trot steps. John McCormack
and Jean Deriske (Prof. O. M. Gass
and John Gates) sang.a fine duet.
Sylvia Pankhurst (C. W. Hoffman)
made a stirring appeal for' suffrage
for her sex, and the members of the
P. E. O. society endorsed her position
by their applause.
Then came a real feature, the appear
ance of Pavola, the skirt dancer,
(Geo. T. Ogilvie) attired in a real
skirt dancer's costume with 987
yards of silk used in its making, and
the dancer had to respond to encore
after encore until he dropped to the
floor from sheer exhaustion. The
Closing number oh the program was
a three round boxing match between
Jess Willard, the heavy weight cham
pion (J. A. Caster) and-"Kid" Mor

One of tttb real big specials will
be shotfn at the Idle Hour theatre
on next Monday when the eight reel
feature play, "An Alien," adapted
from "The Sign of the Rose," will be

big feature we mean every word of it.
It is one of the greatest picture playB
ever produced, so don't miss a real
show.
The synopsis follows:
In order to fittingly celebrate an
expected inheritance from his late
father, Phil Griswold, a worthless
young roue, persuades his friend
Robbins to steal from his employer,
a fashionable florist, the funds neces
sary to make the revelry even great
er.
To his chagrin Phil learns next
day that he has. been cut off with
one dollar, and thus the two young
men are placed in a position from
which they realize it will be difficult
to extricate themselves.
On a visit to the home of his broth
er, William Griswold, Phil notices
his neice's fear of an Italian ditcb
digger, who has come bringing a
Christmas tree. He determines to
kidnap Dorothy, and manages to di
rect suspicion toward Pietro (Mr.
Beban).
Searohing the Italian quarter for
the Alien in his automobile, William
runs over Pietro's little daughter
Rosina and kills her. Pietro wan
ders to the flower shop at which
Robbins is employed, and entering to
buy a rose for the little girl's grave
he is seized by detectives, who think
him the writer of the mysterious
note which told their client to know
the kidnapper by the Sign of the
Rose.
