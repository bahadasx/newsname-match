EDWARD BURLING HEADS
LATEST CAPITAL COUP
Pray for Success of New Rock-
ford From Pulpits.
Ministers over the state are indig­
nant at the efforts of Edward Bur­
ling, Methodist minister at New Rock
l'ord, to have a day set aside in the
churches devoted entirely lo capital
removal.
Fargo, Grand Forks, Mi not clergy­
men and ministers in many other cit­
ies have received a three-page letter
from ltev. Burling, asking them to
set aside a day of prayer and preach­
ing in the interests of New llock
l'ord.
As far as the Tribune is apprised,
most of the ministers either replied
indignantly or else refused flatly to
assist 'Rev. Burling in his efforts to
have the iMothodist. churches of the
state dragged into a political fight.
The Tribune does not know wheth­
er ministers of any other denomina­
tions represented- at New Rockford
were weak enough to allow them­
selves to le used by the promoters of
I lie capital removal fight.
Investigation shows, however, that
the movement started by llov. Bur­
ling is purely personal and does not
have the sanction of the Methodist
church.
Several church leaders
iiave expressed intense regret that
Rev, Burling has used the cloth as a
stalking horse for the capital remov­
al venture.
New 'Rockford land speculators,
knowing that they have no chance to
win this capital removal light on
facts, have sought tp enlist the moral
forces of the state, especially .tho
prohibition workers? iti the fted Rlvfer
valley, by blackening tho good name
of Hie city of E'ismarck.
iFair-minded people over the state
resent the unfair tactics of 'New
Rockford in trying to inject the pro­
hibition issue into this contest. Lead­
ers of that movement are opposed to
having (lie cause of prohibition injur­
ed by allowing the 'New -Rockford pro­
moters lo use them in extracting
(heir chestinits from the embers.

Following Evening of Entertain­
ment Important Business Ques­
tions Come Up.
A meeting of the Bismarck retail
merchants was held in the Commer­
cial club rooms last evening at which
over 150 businessmen and members
of the organization were present. The
meeting was in the nature of a smok­
er and social session followed by a
business session.
The entertainment features of the
evening were in charge of W. L. Mil­
ler, advertising manager of the Tri­
bune, and were most heartily enjoyed
by those present. "The New Hock
ford Capital Band" was one of the
amusing features of the evening, their
music being as much out of tune as
Now Rockford's fight, for the Capital
is with public sentiment throughout
Ihe state.
A. W. lippinger's minstrel troupe
gave the merchants a half hour 0!'
real entertainment, featured by solos,
by Messrs. Reeves, Miller, lhtlvorson,
Humphreys and Arnot, and a recita­
tion by Mr. Davies. Selections by tlio
Kniglus of Pythias quartet were loud­
ly applauded, as- were the instrumen­
tal selections by Dr. Doherty.
Tho entertainment was wound up
with a burlesque boxing match, be­
tween Brooks "Willard" Hoskins and
Joe "Moran" ISreslow, which was de­
clared a draw by the referee, Breslow
stepping out of liis class by the use of
a stepladder, to deliver a, knockout,
blow to his opponent.
Keniston Makes Good Talk.
When the .nieC'tftig "resolved ilftetf
into a'Committee on the whole "on
Ihe good of Ihe community," Chair­
man A. W. Kfppinger introduced
George N. Keniston of Beach, travel­
ing representative of the National
Parks Highway association, who gave
a rattling good talk, which left every
one of his hearers better satisfied with
himself and his home city.
Mr. Keniston urged co-operation
and unanimity not only at home, but
Willi our neighbors, and declared that
Bismarck and Mandan are in a posi­
tion to do great things for themselves
and for the entire Slope county. He
called attention to the city's strategic
location to its wealth of natural re­
sources, and its excellent transporta­
tion facilities. He complimented the
city upon its enterprise and its pro­
gress, and declared it fortunate in the
possession of such live citizens as
those who attended last night's meet­
ing.

HIPPI BILL IS
PASSEDJY1 VOTE
Vice President Marshall Breaks
41-41 Tie and Casts Decid­
ing Vote.
Washington, Feb. 2.—A definite
policy contemplating Philippine inde­
pendence within four years was ap­
proved by the senate today when
Vice President Marshall cast the de­
ciding vote in favor of the Clarke
amendment to the Philippine bill, di­
recting the president to withdraw
American sovereignty within a four
year period.
The vote, which followed weeks of
debate, was 41 to 41.
An effort to recommit the bill was
defeated and final senate action on
the measure, which has not yet pass­
ed the house, was deferred until to­
morrow.
Administration senators in sup­
porting the Clarke amendment main­
tained that some definite provision
was necessary to square up with tin
independence declaration in the Balti­
more platform. Chairman Hitchcock
of the Philippine committee, who op­
posed the amendment, was supported
by eleven other Democrats. Five
Republican Senators, Borah, Clapp,
Kenyon, La Follette and Works, vot­
ed for the amendment.
By the terms of the amendment as
perfected, provision is made for ex­
tension of time for granting independ­
ence, if the president should deem it
advisable, until congress shall have
opportunity to further consider the
subject.

Washington, Feb. 2.—Indications that the British passenger

crow, will be hold by the United States to be a German prize of
war and not tin auxiliary cruiser, were given out tonight in high
ofTTieial quarters. Tho neutrality board, which advises the State de
partineut 011 such questions, announced today that the ship was a
prize, hut the announcement was recalled later, presumably he
cause Ihe State department itself, has not acted.
The real point to be decided is whether the Appam shall re

siaii-Aincrican treaty, or shall be returned to her British owners
under the Halite convention.

Until the status of the ship is de­

of Norfolk customs authorities, and
if turned over to Germany may be
kept in port, or sent to sea as the
German government chooses.
The state department' today re­

Passengers Well Treated.
Reports agree that all the passen­
gers were accorded the best treat­
ment possible by the prize crew under
the circumstances.
Versions of the identity of the Ger­
man raider which captured the Ap­
pam and other craft still differ.
Prince Hatfeldt of the German em­
bassy at Washington asserts that she
is the German cruiser, Moewe, built
in 1913 or 1914 for the imperial navy.
All of the captured British skip­
pers agree, however, that the raider
is a converted merchantman of about
'•5,000 tons, named Ponga, probably
completed a few months ago, mount­
ing six masked guns of near six-inch
caliber and having two torpedo tubes.

Indications were given that the

prize belongs to Germany.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, in a formal note 'to Sec­
retary Lansing, gave notice that' the
Appam came into Hampton Roads
under the treaty which guarantees
her to her captors. Sir Cecil Spring
Rice, the British ambassador, asked
that the ship be returned to her Brit­
ish owners as a prize recovered un­
der the Hague convention.
The Hague convention, under Ar­
ticle 21, provides for the internment
of the crew and the surrender of the
ship, but state department officials
