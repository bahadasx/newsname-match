Board Hearing
Legal representatives of L L. Mc

Improvement project for-Hotel street
from Nuuanu to River, which comes
before . the lcard of supervisors to
night in the form of a public hearing.
Though Mr. McCandless says that
he does not know of any other property-holders
on the street who will
bring in protests tonight, the feeling
is . expressed at the city hall today
that enough opposition may develop
at the hearing to hold up the entire
project. (
McCandless may not appear at the
meeting in person, he stated today to
the Star-Bullietin, but his representa
tives there know his feelings In re
gard to the proposed improvement
"I ccntend that the city should build
the street of Its own accord, said
McCandless In explanation, of. his
stand on the matter. "Our taxes ire
high enough now without bringing in
a frontage tax. , - ;
- ' We have paid taxes for years ' on
Hotel street and figures' go to show
that the total in jiive-y ear period
would build an entirely new street if
once applied that way. It is not fair
to ask property holders to make the
additional payment"
Mr. McCandless says that the argu
ment' relative to increased . value of
property , by street Improvement is of
tittle fayalL iivgoes vtn In value
taxes' will gd along with it he says,
and ievery property owner itlready
finds himself overburdened' with tax

'After all it's the city that gets the
good of these taxes," explains Mc
Candless, Mso the city, supervisors
should be glad to put in good streets
of ' their own accord if . the ; workr la
going to benefit he property.' -
King street extension is also due
for a hearing tonight but it is not be
lieved that any opposition Jo thiy pro.
Ject will arise.
City Engineer Collins will report on
the proposition of narrowing the pro

Haley's Report Shows 799 Per
sons In Territory Who Paid
Federal Tax Last Year
sixty-fourrIsidents
get more than $20,000
Hawaii Rank Fifty-first in List
of States and Territories
in BuIScReturns
Who is the wealthiest man (or wo
man! in the way of income in Hawaii?
Official figures contained in the
annual report of the Internal Revenue
Department' just jmade public show
that 'there is only one Individual in
this territory whtf has an annual net
Income of more ! than $150,000. The
only person in Hawaii who knows the
identity of that, person ia Collector
of Internal Revenue J. F. Haley, and
he won't tell.
The report shows that 799 persons
paid an individual income tax here
during 1915. Their net Incomes
ranged from $3000 up to $150,000 for
that "off- yenr. as it was called.
Those whose Income ranged between
$3000 and $4000 totaled 245, while
145 persons stowed net earnings of
between $4000 and $5000 each. Those
whose earnings were between $5000
and $10,000 for the year numbered 233,
while residents who cleared between
$10)00 and $15,000 for the year num
bered 79. ' '
The surtax Jegins at $20,000 and
those whose incomes ranged from thia
figure to $25,000 numbered 16Twelve
persons had incomes ranging from
$25,000 to $30,000, while 13 had in
comes from this figure up to $40,000.
Ten ranged, between $40,000 and $50,
000, while seven had a net saving
of between $500X ani.75,000. -

ritory who . had neat, little ' nest ; eggs
ranging from $75,000-' to $100,000 each
for ; the year's work, when business
closed for them last "year. 1
Then, comes the one whose net in
come for. the year amounted to more
than. $150,000. It is the identity of
this one that certain curious ones in
Hawaii would like to know, and
chances are they will not-find out
for those who do know would not dare
to tell.
Of the 43. stater, two territories and
one district in the Union, Hawaii
ranks 41st,in the list as to the total
number of returns filed. New York
has 83.405, Pennsylvania, 33,789; Illi
nois, 33,786; Massachusetts, 21,963.
In the whole United States 357,515
persons paid Income tax in 1915. Of
these 114 have an annual income be
tween $500,000 and $1,000,000 and 60
have incomes of more than $1,000,000.
One man in the United States pays
a tax of $2,500,000 on his income. This
means he has an income in excess of
$50,000,000 a year more than $9000 a
second. This man. Is believed to be

ST. LOUIS, Mo., Feb. 3. The greatest crowd that has heard pre
sident Wilson on his present "preparedness tout' today broke into
tremendous cheers when the nation's executive declared that America
should have the greatest navy in the world.
Straight from the shoulder the president today struck for his
national defense program, on behalf of which he planned this speech
making tour. His St. Louis address was made before a crowd that
jammed the big hall to the last limit of capacity, while outside 30,000
more people, unable to get inside the doors, const it uted a vast over
flow gathering.
The cheering was tumultuous as the president drove home his:
points. He declared that the American navy, to safeguard the nation,
should be the largest oh any ocean. It should be unconquerable, ha
emphasized. He asserted that the submarines mostly have, obeyed
international law in their under-water campaigns, but added that the
act of one commander might cause trouble against which the United
States must be fulo" prepared. '
Hundreds of Americans are at sea, he pointed out, and any one
of the ships that carry Americans aboard may be the point of contact
which will bring America into war. One belligerent, he continued,
cut off from the world, has kept America from helping them'as the
country would like. -
