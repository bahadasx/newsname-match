LET'S COMPROMISE
Great Interest Manifested in the
Selection of a Route for the
x'
Jefferson Highway.
Why Not Have A, and Routes
Between Elk River, St.
Cloud and Bemidji?
Several hundred people from north
ern Minnesota were' in attendance at
a meeting of the state highway com
mission in St. Paul last Thursday.
The cause of the large attendance was
the re-hearing on the location of the
Jefferson Highway, the great north
and south national highway from New
Orleans to the Canadian border, and
on to Winnipeg. As yet the "Great
National Highway" exists on paper
only. The name is all there is to it.
The road as mapped out enters the
state in Freeborn county and passes
through Albert Lea, Owatonna, Fari
bault, Northfield, St. Paul, Minneapo
lis, Anoka and Elk River. At Elk
River the trouble commences. As
originally planned by the highway
commission the route was from Elk
River northwesterly to St. Cloud, Lit
tle Falls, Wadena, Park Rapids, and
the state park, and northerly to Be
midji, and from that point in a west
erly direction to Crookston thence
north to St. Vincent.
Brainerd people claim that the Jef
ferson highway is supposed to be.a
scenic highway, and that the proper
route is north from Elk River to
Princeton and the queen of Minnesota
lakesunsurpassable Mille Lacs,
Brainerd, Gull lake, Leech lake and
a hundred other beautiful lakelets to
Bemidji. If scenic beauty is taken
into consideration the Mille Lacs lake
Gull lake and Leech lake route cannot
be surpassed.
But the people of Sauk Centre and
Long Prairie were also on hand to
iirge the claims of their section. They
are desirous of having the road branch
off at St. Cloud to Sauk Centre and
thence northward through Long Prai
rie to Wadena. Much can be said in
favor of this route as the road would
pass through a very rich farming
country, but for scenic-beauty it can
not compare with the Mille Lacs-Leech
Sake route.
Of course Little Falls people object
ed to both the Sauk Centre and Mille
Lacs lake routes, and wanted the orig
inal location to stand.
Something can be said in favor of
all the proposed routes, each has its
advantages and disadvantages, but, of
course, the Union thinks the Mille
Lacs lake route is by far and away
the best.
There is no dispute as to the loca
tion of the road as far as Elk River,
and no one dreams of not touching
Bemidji, it is the designation be
tween these two points that is worry
ing the highway commission and mul
tiplying the grey hairs of the heads
of the members thereof. The Union
suggests this compromise. Let there
be three Jefferson highways between
Elk River and Bemidji as follows:
Route A via Mille Lacs lake, Brainerd
and Leech lake route via St. Cloud,
Little Falls, Wadena and Park Rapids
route via St. Cloud, Sauk Centre,
Long Prairie, and Wadenathe and
routes would converge at Wadena.
If the compromise is adopted and
later on there is to be any additional
aid extended through the highway
commission other than the regular
apportionment from the state road and
bridge fund, let if be given to the most
deserving.
There is'nothing unfair in this prop
osition, and it is an easy way out of
the difficulty for the highway, com
mission.
Normal Convention.
A convention of normal instructors
and students of the Mora, Milaca and
Princeton schools was held in this vil
lage at the Armory Friday afternoon.
About 50 were, in attendance, and the
meeting should be productive of much
good.
N-
Miss Weiaend^of the Princeton nor
mal department presided, and inter
esting and instructive talks were given
along lines that will prove beneficial
to the students when they engage in
the teaching vocation by Supt. Mar
shall of Princeton, Supt. Thompson of
Milaca, and Miss Cassie Spencer of the
Milaca normal department., County
Superintendent Ewing was present,
and spoke in his usual happy vein. He
dwelt on the importance of maintain
ing harmonious relations with school
'boards, and imparted information
that will .be of much value to the
students when the timl for them to
lapply it arrives. Miss Deuel of Milaca
gave "paper on. "Modern School
Grounds," and it showed that much
study and careful preparation had
been given the subject. A class of 4th
graders in mental arithmetic was con
ducted by Miss Young of Princeton,
and the problems were solved in a
manner that reflected credit upon all
concerned.
After the session those in attend
ance visited the Princeton schools, and
the visitors from Milaca and Mora
partook of lunch with the Princeton
normal class at the Armory before
departure for home.
Self-Fed Pigs Show Like Tastes.
As interest increases in the use of
self-feeders for swine new questions
arise.,One such question is this, "Allow
a bunch of pigs to select their own ra
tions and eat at will do the different
pigs select similar rations?"
To secure some information on this
question-, we fed last summer ''at
University Farm 10 pigs on individual
self-feeders. In other words, each pig
had his own pen and his own self
feeder. No other pigs ate with him or
slept with him. Five of the pigs were
farrowed in March and five in May.
All were kept on self-feeders from
July 10 until November 15: a total of
128 days. At the close of the test the
March pigs were 237 days old and the
May pigs 191 days of age. The five
March pigs averaged 287.1 pounds
eacKand the May pigs 248.4 pounds
each.
The average daily gain for the five
March pigs was 1.8 pounds each, and
for the May pigs was 1.5 pounds. The
March group produced 100 pounds of
gain for each 392.4 pounds of grain,
while the May group consumed 392.54
pounds of grain for each 100 pounds
of pork. For the entire test the ration
selected by the March pigs contained
88.26 per cent of shelled corn, 9.02 per
cent of tankage and 27.2 per cent of
shorts. The May pigs took 86.99 per
cent of shelled corn, 10.82 per cent of
tankage and 2.19 per cent of shorts.
Each had available shelled corn, shorts
and tankage, each fed separate, with
water to drink. No other grains and
no pasture or milk was available to
them.
The individual rations as taken by
each pig are not yet available, but will
be published later.R.C. Ashby:, As

Milaca's Prosperous Creamery.
Milaca's Farmers' Co operative
creamery is in a flourishing condition,
the annual report shows that during
the year a total of $173,674.24 was paid
for butterfat, and that a dividend, of 2
cents per pound was also paid for but
terf at. The total receipts received for
butter was $200,954.33. There are few
creameries in the state can make a
better ..showing.
The officers elected for the ensuing
year are as follows: Carl Sholin,
president John G. Axell, vice-presi
dent Chas. Heilig, secretary Richard
Hamer, treasurer Frank Parmer, Jno.
Nelson and Otto Stadig, directors.
The creamery is well officered and
well managed and is deserving of the
support and patronage of ^he farm
ers. We hope that the annual report
next year will show an increase in the
volume of business transacted.
Foreston Creamery Elects Officers.
The following officers were elected
at the annual meeting of the Foreston
creamery held on the 22nd ult., in the
new school house of that village: F.
C. Peabody, president John A. Nelson,
vice-president Alfred Carlson, secre
tary K. E. Johnson, treasurer. H..G.
Krueger, Gust L. Nystrom and Ed
Johnson were chosen trustees, The
creamery^is in a flourishing condition,
and during 1915 manufactured 22,246
pounds of butter over the output of
1914. The average price paid for but
terfat was 28.05c, and 25.14c was the
average price received for butter. Dur
ing the year patrons were paid $37,-
798.36 in cash or butter for 134,741.31
pounds of butterf at. The total re
ceipts amounted to $41,095,56. -V
Proud of Its Electric Plant.
Last week's Star-News contained an
illustrated write-up of the new electric
power plant that has just been in
stalled at that place. The^ people of
Elk-River have reason io feel proud
of their electric plant, and they ought
to appreciate the enterprise and'pub
lic spiritedness of Mr. *F. D. Water
manthe man who gave it to them.
It was quite dark the other evening
when the Princeton train passed
through Elk River and one could not
help noticing how pleasant and cheer
ful the place looked with its brilliantly
lighted streets, stores and residences.
But the miserable old railroad depot
with its .smoky kerosene lamp was a
veritable cave of glooin. __ lX
MORA B0YS_ DOWNED
Princeton H. S. Plays a Clever Game
and Wins by a Count j.
of 14 to 7.
Princeton Girls Forced to Acknowl-
edge Athletic Supremacy of
the Mora Maids.
One of the largest crowds of the
season was on hand Friday evening
at the Armory to witness the basket
ball games between the Mora and
Princeton high schools
With two of their stars out of the
linecup the Princeton girls were at
considerable disadvantage, but even
at that during the first half they
battled on almost even terms with
their -opponents, the count being 2 to
0 in favor of-the visitors when the
period ended. The second half was
heart-breaking from a local view
point, however,- as the Mora maidens
propelled the ball through the net on
five different occasions, \yhi]e when
the Princeton girls attempted to
count, the basket had the unhappy
faculty of eluding the ball a.man
ner that was absolutely provoking.
The Princeton girls have one vic
tory to their credit over Mora this
season, which tends to soften the
grief. The two teams lined up as fol
lows:
Princeton ...:.Pos...v.... Mora
Janice Umbehocker R. .T.....Iva Peterson
Anita Davis L. Evelyn Olson
Sadie Penhallegon Hannah East
Myra Dickey g. ...Olgra Johnson
Grace Staples ....L. *G .Nora Selstead
Eunice Neely played left forward during
the second half.
The contest between the boy teams
was a sizzler, and the Princeton lads
played a particularly fast and aggres
sive article of basket ball. In every
department of the game their superi
ority over the visitors was so marked
as to leave no room for doubt as to
which was the better team. Superb
passing featured the work of the
locals, and their showing was most
gratifying, as they were opposed by
a team that from the exceptionally
husky center down had a considerable
advantage in weight and re&ch.^^he
final count was 14 to 7.
Mora scored first, befng awarded
a free throw shortly after play starts
ed. A few minutes thereafter the
referee called another foul on,Prince
ton and the visitors counted again.
The Kanabec county athletes did not
remain in the lead very long, however,
as Berg soon tied the store when he
stopped a rapid pass and brought the
crowd to its feet by negotiating a
basket from the center of the floor.
Raiche.. dropped one through the net
shortly thereafter, and when he fol
lowed this with a free throw Prince
ton had a lead of three points. Mora
secured its first field goal at -this
stage of the game, but Princeton held
its lead when Jesmer planted the ball
through the net. Before tne time
keeper's whistle sounded the visitors"
negotiated another free throw, and
the count at the end of this period
was 7 to 5 in favor of Princeton.
The clever defensive play of the
locals featured the second half, and
during, this round the Princeton de
fense was penetrated only once. Dur
ing the first few minutes of play
Mora secured its only goal of the half,
which tied the score temporarily. Grow
broke the tie by tossing the sphere
through the net, and then Raiche
added tathe gloom of the visitors by
taking two shots at the basket, count
ing upon each occasion. The scoring
ende when Raiche negotiated a free
throw, which was needed to make the
score stand at the ratio of 2 to V.

NOTES:
A gentleman from Elk River ref
ereed the game between the boys and
did satisfactory work.
Prof. Jacka and a Moraite each
refereed a half of the contest staged
by the gls and what they didn' see
featured.
The high school' orchestra favored
.those present with several selections
pleasingly rendered.
The locals are going particularly
fast at present, and right now can
make it interesting for any high
school team in this section. Their
work Friday evening was a pleasure
to witness.
A loyal band of rooters cheered the town."Washington Star
orange and black players, and added
to the enthusiasm.
The powerful Sandstone team will
be here next week, and if the Prince
ton, lads put up the same kind of a
game that they did Friday evening
some contest will ensue
There will be. no basket vball game
here this week, as Manager Hofflan
der has decided to give his stars a
rest, and neither Co. nor the high
scbjool will be seen in action.
In conclusion it might be well to
remark' that the Sandstone-Princeton
game bids fair to be one of those
contests you frequently read, of but
seldom, see.-

Receipts and Shipments Have Been
Extremely -Light at Princeton
During the Past Week.
Potato Holdings in the Nineteen Lead-
ing, Northern States 38 Per
Cent Short of a Year Ago.
"Nothing doing" sums up the local
potato situation, briefly but compre
hensively. Receipts have been ex
tremely light the past week, due to
the cold weather, and there have been
few shipments. The market has rang
ed from 65c to 70c on all varieties ex
cept Triumphs, which have been worth
from 90c to 95c.
The outside market is firm. The
Chicago market had an active trade
last week with limited offerings1.
The federal bureau of, Crop .-Esti-
mates, under date of Jan. 21, issued a
report of Irish potato holdings in the
19x leading northern producing states
son January 1. The report says stocks
were unusually small or just the re
verse of conditions of a year ago. The
report also says that southern potato
growers who compete in the spring
months with stocks carried over in
the northern states probably will not
meet the same conditions as prevailed
last spring. The report then says:
"Supplies on hand January 1, 1916,
for market, are estimated to be about
38 per cent smallerv than a year ago,
15 per cent smaller than two years
ago, 30 per cent smaller than three
years ago, but 16 per cent larger than
four years ago.
If, for the purpose of comparison,
the estimates in percentages of mar
ketable stocks of potatoes on January.
1 be appliedsto the estimates of total
production, it shows, in the states in
cluded (which produced 66 per cent of
the 1915 crops and 78 per cent of the
1914 crop of the United States), a to
tal of 105,345,000 bushels January 1,
1916, compared with 169,554,000 a
year ago, 123, 292,000 two years ago,
149,845,000 three years ago and 90,-
778,000 four years ago. the United
States seldom imports or exports
relatively a large quantity of potatoes.
^war has no
material direct influence upon the po
tato market of the United States."
According to the Chicago Packer the
potato situation in the east last week
was rather a puzzle. Conditions were
easy in New/York, prices'weaker in
Michigan, with Maine shipping sec
tions holding very firm. Western New
York potato growers are letting go at
$1.00 a bushel.
Fair Dates Will Not Conflict.
The dates of the Mille Lacs, Sher
burne, Anoka, Isanti, Kanabec and Pine
county fairs will not conflict the com
ing fall. At a meeting held in Minner
apolis yesterday representatives of the
agricultural societies ofthe above nam
ed counties agreed upon non-conflict
ing dates.
Mille. Lacs county was represented
at the meeting by Charles Keith, J. J.
Skahen and Ira G. Stanley of Prince
ton and J. A. Allen of Milaca, and this
year's fair will be held upon the dates
previously decided uponSeptember
13 to 16, inclusive.
This is a move in the right direc
tion, as these fairs have considerable
territory in common, and all will be
benefited.
Mr. Keith returned last evening,
the city being so full of auto show vis
itors, St. Paul Winter Carnival revel
lers and democrats as to make the se
curing of hotel accommodations^
problem. Messrs. Skahen and Allen
remained over for the democratic con
