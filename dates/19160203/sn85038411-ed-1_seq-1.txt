MOTHER FIGHTS
TIGERISHLY TO
KEEP HER BABY
Frantic at Loss of Child in
Habeas Corpus Hearing She
Electrifies Court
AN "UNDERWORLD" STORY
Marvin Wertz, Divorced Hus
band, Gels Daughter After
Pitched Rattle
Frantic at the prospect of losing her i
S-year-old daughter Katherine, pretty'
Mrs. Rose A. Wertz this morning le
gaily—then physically—fought the
Law in No. 1 courtroom to retain pos
session of the child.
The cries of the mother and child
drowned the pounding of Additional .
Law Judge McCarrell's gavel as Sheriff
W. W. Caldwell and Deputy William;
Hoffman struggled to separate the
mother and child.
Mrs. Wertz is the divorced wife of;
Marvin G. C. Wertz. He declared the
divorcee had lived in the "tenderloin"
district and that she was unfit to'
rear the child. To-day's legal battle \
was the hearing in a writ of habeas
• orpus which Wertz instituted to get
possession of Katherine.
And after a dramatic recital of the
iacts which led the youthful husband
to attempt to recover his child. Addi
tional Law Judge McCarrell turned
the youngster over to the custodv of
H'ertz's sister. Mrs. Mir.nie Dolbin,
»'ife of George Dolbin, 2135 Jefferson j
street.
Mother Runs Front Courtroom
Declaring wildly that she wouldn't
*"ow Mrs. Dolbin or anyone else to ■
"lay a hand on her child." Mrs. Wertz j
struggled in the grasp of Deputy Hoff
man and raced blindly out 'of the >
courthouse in her efforts to find Mrs. I
Dolbin and the little girl.
Luncheon-bound businessmen, sten
ographers and clerks crowded about
the courthouse while the despairing
young mother desperately tried to find
the little girl.
The Battle Begin*
That Mrs. Wertz was bitterly de-,
termined not to confine her struggle to
legal limits was indicated iust after
the hearing began. Time, and again
she conferred so audibly to her at
torney. Robert Stucker. that Judge
McCarrell bad to rap for order.
The small Katherine hugged her
mother tightly throughout the hear
ing except when the latter took her
place on the stand.

Schoolma'am Bride
Travels From Far
Colorado to Wed
Front faraway Pueblo. Colorado,
pretty Helen Margaret Heller, a school
teacher, traveled to this city this aft
ernoon to wed Lemuel Sliowall. The ;

Say Privation and
Pestilence in Poland
Exceed Darkest Picture
By Associated Press
Berlin, Feb. 3, via London. The
darkest pictures drawn by privation i
and pestilence in Poland have failed
to portray (he extent of misery of the
war sufferers there, it was said to-day
by two Americans who have made a
personal investigation. They are
Frederick C. Walcott, European rep-'
resentative of the Rockefeller Foun
dation and Caspar Whitney, of the
American Commission for Relief in
Belgium. These men have just re
turned from a fortnight's trip through
Poland for investigation of the need
of relief.
They say there is virtually no food
left, except, potatoes and a small
amount of flour. Little fuel remains.
Typhus and other diseases prevail.
Thousands of persons whose homes'
were destroyed during the Russian
retreat are without shelter. Little
livestock is left and accordingly there
is no meat or fat food for the people, i
The fact that they are living almost,
exclusively on potatoes have resulted
in stomach diseases. Black typhus
has broken out. There are now 301
cases daily in Warsaw. The general i
deathrate in Poland has risen from 19 j
to 30 per 1.000.

BRITISH EXPECT
FIERCE TEUTONIC
DRIVE ON CALAIS
Believe Germans Arc Planning
to Rlast Way Through to
Channel Port
NOW PLANNING CAMPAIGN
Are Preparing to Hurl Large
Masses of Artillery and
Men Into Flanders
By . Associated Press
Although military operations on
the western front, as well as in most
of the other main theaters of war, are
virtually at a halt, London apparently
i
is expecting a new move soon by the
Germans in Northern France and
Flanders.
Present comment indicates a belief
that an offensive movement on a large
scale is in course of preparation, the
Germans expecting by the use of
masses of artillery and infantry to
blast away to Calais on the English
channel.
Latest reports on the situatioii along
this front, however, show little hut
artillery firing, grenade fighting and
similar minor operations.
lilslroM in Poland
Great distress in Poland is reported
by representatives of American relief
organizations who have reached Ber
lin. The suffering is particularly from
lack of shelter and fuel, while typhus
and other diseases are prevalent. It
is declared that 30 per cent, of the
people are dependent upon relief.
Artillery Active
Intense artillery activity along the
Franco-Belgian front, reported in to
day's German official statement, may
presage another important offensive
movement in this field by one side or ,
the other. Ixmdon appears to hold
the view that the initiative just now
will be with the Germans, who may try
to break through and gain Calais.
I'-Boats Make Raid
Paris records a German attack on j
the French positions north of the Aisne
near the village of Boos.
The Germans are continuing their
submarine activities in the North Sea.
according to a dispatch from the Neth
erlands recording the torpedoing of
the Dutch motor vessel Artemis in
these waters. The Artemis put Into
the Hook of Holland leaking. From
London comes announcement of the
sinking- of the British steamer Belle of
France, last reported at a port In

British Press Intimates
Turk Prince Was Murdered
By Associated Press
London, Feb. 3. The report that
the heir to the Turkish throne, Yussof
Izzedin, committed suicide is received
with general incredulity by the British
press, althougn the report has been
accompanied by circumstantial de
tails.
The British press draws attention to
the fact that the prince's relations
with Knver Pasha had long been
strained to the breaking point, that
the prince was anti-German and that
his name had not been allowed to ap
pear in Turkish dispatches for a long
time.
The Graphic says: "The story that
he committed suicide may be true,
but other explanations are at least
possible. Enver Pasha has already
shown lack of scruples in employing
summary methods for the removal of
opponents."
Yussof Izzedin, who was born at
Constantinople October 9, 1857, was a
first cousin of the present Sultan.
Vahid Idin, who is mentioned as the
new heir apparent was born at Con
stantinople January 12. 1861. and is
the brother of the present Sultan.
