Attend Meeting in Toledo and are
Inspired With Work.
Members of tho Pcrrysburg
Troop of Boy Scouts were guests
at a banquet and social gathering
at the Y. W. C. A. building in To
ledo on Friday night last.
Tho little men were accom
panied by their fathers or "big
brothers" or a friend ,and after
enjoying the banquet they listened
to speeches by proirinent Scout
Masters and witnessed many
demonstrations of . efficiency
shown by the young Scouts.
The meeting proved a great in
spiration for the boys and their
"escorts" and tho entire evening's
program gave evidence of the
great good being accomplished in
the training of the boys in ways
of usefulness that will bo a great
uplift in their life's efficiency.
Among the men who accom
panied the Pcrrysburg Scouts
were Dr. Canfield, B. W. Caldwell,
Prof. R. L. Cole, C. P. Champney,
F. A. Witzler, Rev. Dr. Pheley,
James. Laing, Mr. Schuster,
Charles Bayer, R. R. Hartshorn,
Louis Marti and Wrfrd Hanson.
Four-Fifths of County Stoned.
Auditor Ralph Gillespie esti
mates that, if the roads now pe
titioned for were all built, Wood
county would have little more
than 100 lUiiles of unpiked road.
There are now about 1200 miles of
pike in the county; and seventy
petitions for additional roads cover
about 200 miles of the remaining
roads. Sentinel.
Although four-fifths of the roads
of the county may be of the so
called improved variety, it is a
deplorable fact that about half
that amount is in an abominable
condition and is a sad commen
tary on the bad management
that prevails in relation to stone
road building in Wood county.

Tho regular meeting of last
Wednesday night was attended by
tho mayor, the clerk, and all coun
cilmen. A proposal to imporve Walnut
street from Third street to Indiana
Ave., excavating a roadway 12
feet wide and filling with river
gravel was considered and on mo
tion of Mr. Leydorf, seconded by
Mr. Dibling, the improvement was
authorized.
The crossingsjit intersections of
Second and Pino streets, also Wal
nut and Sixth, are to be filled with
cinders so that "navigation" will
be possible at all times.
A petition of W. P. Scott and
others asking for the location of
an arc light at intersection of Wal
nut and Sixth street was read, and
by unanimous vote the light com
mittee was authorized to establish
the light in accordance with pro
visions of lighting ordinance.

AGRICULTURAL ITEMS
Ohio State University News Letters
to Farmers and Others,
'Cast your alfalfa before swine
and your wife will wear pearls," t
says the Kansas alfalfa expert,
Cobrun, in urging Ohio farmers to
begin growing this profitable'
legume. "Alfalfa is adapted to
almost any region but must have a!
soil sweetened with lime and inoc
ulated with soil from a successful
alfalfa field or sweet clover cor
ner." Many farmers have failed
with alfalfa because of poor seed
and careless methods in providing
a proper seed bed. Mr. (Joburn
points out the fact that alfalfa is
an ideal feed for horses, cattle,
sheep, swine and chickens. Land
that grows alfalfa is worth 50
more than land that has' not been!
made to grow
legumes he claims
this queen of
Home grown seed corn, repeat
edly found "best by test" will be
one of the most sought-for farm
commodities next spring. Those
who have high grade seed corn for
sale in fairly large quantities
should let others know about it.
Otherwise seed taken by faith from
other regions may bo planted and
not only the individual but also
the community will suffer. Ad
vertisements of seed corn in the
home paper, however modest will
surely bring results because they
will likely reach the men who will
be the most likely customers. If
the farmer has high-class seed corn
his advertisements will add to his
reputation as a good farmer and
business man and at tho same
time confer a benefit upon tho
community.
"Order your nursery stock now
if you want to get the best trees
for your young orchard" advises
Prof. Wendel Paddock of the hor
ticultural department, Ohio State
University. January is the time
to buy but the delivery may be
made later. Many of tho big
commercial orchard planters order
one-year "whips." ' Practically
none buy trees over two years old.
The older or larger tree loses more
roots in digging and it takes a
longer time for it to recover after
transplanting. One-year trees
may be headed exactly where de
sired while older trees are already
headed and must lose their buds
if they are cut back to tho lower
heads.
"Preparedness," defined in its
most appropriate term for the far
mer means a thoroughly equipped
outfit for combating tho pests
that attack tho garden and or
chard durincr tho spring months,
according to W. H. Mosier, assis
tant in horticulture, Ohio State
University. Plenty of spray ma
terial should bo gotten on hand at
once.
Concerning Nothing Very Serious
But Worthy of Thought.
By the way, what has become of
the man who was chief engineer of
the finance department of the
Peace Ship Oscar II?
A Toledo councilman proposes
to regulate (by ordinance) the
length of women's skirts. Will
the police department have a skirt
measuring squad of officers pa
troling the streets with yard sticks
measuring the skirts of tho fair
ones to make sure they are not too
short?
A Perrysburg councilman is re
ported as saying that "the Way
property should be made a village
Park or made to earn a better
rental." He is quite right. Keep
,fc UP) jjr Councilman, and
you
may be able to make that piece of
property of some value to the vil
lage some day
A Toledo zoo man has declared
the ground hog to be too everlast-
' ingly lazy to wake up and look for
his shadow on the 2nd of February
and thus Toledo is responsible for
the death of one of the most
ancient of pet theories.
The Blade paragrapher says the
"busy little bee" only works six
months of the year." By this evi
dence is proven that a country edi
tor has the bee beaten by six long
months.
Burbank," says the St. Louis
Globe-Democrat, "has been able
to do everything except denature
the prune." The prune should be
left alone As a prune it fulfills
its mission. Blade.
Right you are Bro. Blade. A
seedless orange, and a stingless bee
may be all right, but a pruneless
prune never!
Toledo telephone girls are now
taking voice culture so they can
sing it softly when they say "the
line is busy." This is done to
eliminate cuss words coming back
from the Phone user.
STICK!
You're like the rest of us, old scout
And swear each year you'll bo
A better chap ere the year runs out
Into eternity,
That's how you know you'll keep out
tront
Only you don't!
You're going to put a raw-hide brake
On all profanity,
An angel child, while you're nwake,
Asleep, from faults you're free!
You've made up your mind what to
do, and dont
Fine; But you wont!
On good intentions you aro strong,
A halo hangs ubovo
i Your head and you can think no
I wrong
Your heart is mleu with lovol
For a day, perhaps, you feel like
a saint
Only you ain't!
We've all been there don't think
you're queer,
It is the way of man
To try improvements every year
His faults to sternly scan.
But stick to the idea, just the same
It's some fine game!
Paragrafs
On Friday afternoon last a meet
ing was held at the town hall for
the purpose of perfecting the
organization of the Perrysburg
Grain and Sued Company, the new
co-operative company in which
ninny of the farmers of this
locality are taking an active inter
est with tho object in view of oper
ating a Perrysburg elevator in
which the grain producers will
share in tho profits obtained from
the sale of their crops.
In many other localities similar
organizations or companies have
proven the advantages to the pro
ducers who share in the profits
resulting from tho business.
The shares are sold at $100 and
each shareholder is entitled to
ONE VOTE ONLY in the election
of directors of the company, thus
eliminating tho possibility of the
control of the company passing
into the hands of a few men who
might seek to "run the business"
in their own interest.
The .stockholder will not only
receive a dividend on his stock,
but will also receive a share in the
profits above the running ex
penses, 'and -will also receive a
profit or premium in accordance
with the amount of produce ho de
livers to the company.
There are many similar com
panies in the state and all are
meeting with phenominal success,
and there is no apparent reason
why the same condition should not
prevail here.
After a preliminary meeting for
discussion there were many ad
ditional subscribers to the stock,
after which the hoard of directors
was elected as follows :
For three years George
Emerick, A. J. "Witzler, Henry F.
Limmer.
For two years George Kurfess,
"Wm. Moser, Conrad Kohl.
For one year John Snyder,
John Moser, George Eckle, Sr.
The directors will meet for the
purpose of electing officers.
The proposition looks good from
every point of view and will un
doubtedly prove a success.
There is room for more stock
holders and every producer is in
vited to come in and boost the new
co-operative company.
"In union there is strength."
Tho following officers were elec
ted for the year:
President Geo. Emerick.
Vice-Pres Conrad Kohl
Sec.-Treas. 11. It. Hartshorn.
Advisory Board Geo. Emerick,
A. J. Witzler and John Schneider.
Constipation.

stipution take Chamberlain's Tablets
