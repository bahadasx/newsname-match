N0R1H DAKOTA
ASSOCIATION
MISSION
Hold Gathering in Connec
tion With theyCorn and
Clover Convention.
FINE PROGRAM
GIVEN TODAY
Business to be Transacted
Tomorrow Night at An
nual Banquet.
The fourteenth annual meeting of
the North Dakota Live Stock associa
tion opened in this city this morning.
All of the convention sessions are
held in connection with the North Da
kota Corn and Clover 'convention and
Mid-Winter fair. Today's and tomor
row's sessions of the Corn and Clover
show have been given over entirely to
the Live Stock association and that
organization provides the program for
each meeting.
The annual business meeting of the
association will be held tomorrow
night following the banquet at the
Hotel Dacotah. The banquet will be
gin at 7 o'clock, after which a brief
informal program of toasts will be
given. The greater part of the even
ing will be devoted to the business
meeting, however, as there are a num
ber of Important things to be taken
up, including the election of officers
and the selection of the next meeting
place.
At the meeting this morning, W. B.
Richards of Ellendale. N. D., gave an
address on "Self-Feeder Method of
Orowing and Fattening Hogs," and
H. White of Cogswell, N. D., gave an
unusually interesting paper on "Stub
ble Orasing and Fattening Sheep la
North Dakota."
tTsher L. Burdlck ot Williston, N.
D.f president of the association, has
not reached the city as yet, but he li
expected to be here tomorrow morn
ing. W. H. Peters of the state agri
cultural society, is in charge of the'
meetings. ..
It. 7. Flint, commissioner of agri
culture and labor, is attending the
eetings and tonight will give an 11
ustrated address on "North Dakota's
lve Stock."
H. a. Van Pelt, editor of Kimball's
Dairy Farmer of Waterloo, la., is one
of the prominent live stock authorities
attending the convention, and during
the day he gives two addresses. He
speaks this afternoon on "Milk Pro
duction as a Side Line to Grain
Farming," and tonight he speaks on
"Future of the Dairy Industry in the
Northwest."
R. N. Cuykendahl of the Dakota
Farmer, Aberdeen, 8. D., is the other
speaker for the afternoon session. He
talks on "Live Stock Advertising and
Mall Order Selling." Thomas Cooper,
director of the North Dakota experi
ment station, and Mr. Flint complete
the evening program.
The meeting this morning was un
usually well attended, an evidence of
the ftict that live stock farming has
become one of the principal undertak
ings of North Dakota farmers. Every
phase of the live stock work is to be
taken up during the two days' sessions
and there is no-doubt that exoeption
ally good results will be attained.
Fattening Sheep.
Mr. White's address on "Stubble
Grazing and Fattening Sheep," proved
one of great interest and importance,
as it covered the sheep herding ques
tion in detail.and showed how the
farmers of the state can make It a
paying proposition.
The speaker spoke of the grain that
Is left on the stubble fleld, the lodged
grain and the grain that is scattered
about by various agencies. Hogs, cat
tle and horses will not solve the prob
lem and turn this waste into profit.
But with sheep it is different. They
are weed destroyers, and will turn
every weed, every head and kernel of
grain left on the stubble into profit.
Requires No Experience.
To stubble feed sheep requires no
experience, he said, no high priced
feed, no 'balanced ration and no In
vestment in extra buildings. With or
dinary attention, the sheep will make
from 78 cents to $1.60 per head in
sixty days. Next to hall Insurance,
he declared, sheep are the best pro
tection, as they will help the farmer
to realise considerable off his hailed
grain.
He recommended onel kind of sheep
for stubble grazing, although, if there
is plenty «f stubble, mixed herds do
well. The lamb flock ought to be
herded separately, he said.
Profit of $1,000.
Mr. White also devoted much time
to the marketing of sheep. If the
price remains the same the farmer
sells as when he bought, a profit in
dollars and .cents is assured, but, as is
generally the case, if the price ad
vances a good profit is shown on the
investment. He said that a flock of
I,500 should yield a profit of at least
11,000.
He, spoke of the decrease in the
sheep market, the falling off last year
amounting to 766,000. In purchasing
sheep, the farmer ought to buy range
bred sheep, as they can be purchased
cheaper and will save freight. They
Will do better on the stubble and will
bring a better price than eastern bred
sheep.
In1 concluding, he said:
"When your sheep first arrive, flu
them on hay and run them on t|ie

CHANGE IN
RBAH0NS
General Feeling in Germany
is That Crisis Has Been
Modified.
NEWSPAPERS ARE
KEEPING QUIET
Writer Doubts Whether
Wilson Will Get Good Re
suite From England.
Berlin, Feb. 3.—The feeling which
has been prevalent in German circles
that the crisis at hand in German
American relations, particularly in
regard to the Lusitanla case, has been
moderated, if only in a slight degree,
by the semi-official announcement re
garding the forwarding to Ambassa
dor von Bernstorff at Washington, of
Instructions which give hope of a defi
nite settlement.
Bourse, which has been depressed
by the situation, recovered somewhat
on the publication of the announce
ment.
Little Comment.
Newspapers have little to say re
garding the situation. The chief edi
torial writer of the Kreuz Zeitung
devotes a large part of his daily re
view to the dispassionate discussion
of the German-American affairs, rec
ognising that Washington cannot be
reproached for endeavoring to make
the best of America's favorable posi
tions in regards to German and Great
Britain by bringing pressure to bear
upon both, playing one against an
other. It gives a warning, however,
against the over-estimation of the im
portance of such "diplomatic ges
tures."
Writer In Doubt.
The writer doubts whether Presi
dent Wilson will "commit the fooliBh
act" of entering the world war, de
spite all his "bellicose utterances on
his preparedness tour through the
provinces." He doubts whether Wilson
will be able to obtain any definite re
sults by his protests against the Brit
ish interference with trade. There
fore, the writer says, Germany must
rely upon herself.

said, "the greatest in the world."
The president declared that sub
marine commanders abroad have in
structions which for the most part
conform with international law, but
that the act of one commander might

Many Cargoes Afloat.
"Upon the ocean there are hun
dreds of cargoes of American goods,"

the city.
The president was requested at this
