Death of Popu
lar Young Mar
M. Avery Looper aied at th
home of his mother in the Cro
Roads community, 'on Sundai
last, in the 87th year of ws life
after a l6ng illness. Duxg hiu
sickness all that could be' don
by physicians and wood nursing
by loving friends and relatives
availed not and his immortal
soirit burst the prison bars of
clay and winged its flight to the
realms of peace and joy.
Avery was a very popular
young man, with almost every
one who knew him. He had
pleasing manners, a good word
and a happy smile for all. SeV
eral years ago he went west and
spent about three years in Ab,
erdeen, Washington. His aged
mother being In Ibad health he
came back to be with, or near
her in her old age, to comfort
her by his presence and to help
do anything for her that she
might need. Little did ho or
others think that he would go
before his aged mother. For
some years past Avery had lived
in Greenville and worked in the
store with C. D. Stradley & Co.,
and also with Hobbs-Henderson
Co., and with both of these firni
he was very popular and they
had every confidence in his in
tegrity and business ability.
He leaves an aged mother,
Mrs. Jerry Looper, who was a
Miss Chastain before her mar
riage, two brothers, Thomas and
Edward, and two sisters, Mrs.
Wm. Turner and Miss - Loop
er, besides many near relatives,
and a host of friends to weep fr
him. .
His funeral services were held
by Rev. D. W. Hiott in the pres
ence of a very large concourse
of people at Cross Rodds church
on Monday afternoon. The peo
pie came *through the rain and
mud to sbow their love and ap
preciation for the dead and tc
offer their symipathy to the be.
teaved ones. Many beautiful
flowers were laid on the' caskel
as tributesof love.
May God comfort the heart
of all who grieve over his death,

The Sad Death
i, of Jimmy Gantt
Jimmy Gantt, the tiwelve-yea
old son of Mr. and Mrs. -John
Gantt of the Pickens mill village
who was taken to John Hopkine
hospital in BaltinoreThursday,
January20, died there Saturday,
January 29, five days after an
operation which vas made Mon
day, the 24th. The direct cause
of his'death was pneumonia.
The little fellow had been af
flicted with deformed feet since
bith and the people.of Pickens
made up money enough to send
him to Baltimore with the hope
of having his feet straidhtened.
The Southern railway furnished
free transportation for the boy
and a physician to accompany
him and the public subscription
money was used to defray hos
pital expenses. . Dr. F. S. Porter
.of-Pickens accompanied the pa
tient.
The difficult operation was
performed Monday and on one
foot was highly successful, but
a part of the other. foot had to
be amputated. In a few days
pneumonia set in and resulted
in the boy's, death. The best
medical -attention- the world
could afford was given and some
of the most famous surgeons at
tended him, but to no avail.
This was a particularly sad
death for many reasons and the
sympathy of thecommunity is
extended the bereaved family.
Jimmy wvas in high spirits when
he left B'ickens for the hospital,
but said whatever happened he
didu't want to come back with
his feet deformed. Dr. Porter
said he was the most optimistic
and patient little fellow he ever
saw and the doctor was greatly
unset over the death.
Funeral services were conduc
ducted 4t Secona church Monday
by Rev. L.. E. Wiggins and the
body was buried In the church
cemetery.
About two years a-o a broth
er~of the dead boy was suddenly
killed by liglytning in Pickens.
H; B. Hendricks, who had
charge of the public subscription
to defray expenses, wishes to
thank all of the people who con
tributed so liberally, and especi
ally the Southern railway com
pany and the officers of the Pick
ens mill.
A Wedding of
Much Interest
A wedding of considerable in
terest occurred at the home of
the bride's father, E. Frank
Looper, near Pickens, January
25th, when Mr. Ed F. Hendricks
and Miss Christine Looper be

was a quiet home wedding and
only a few near relatives and
.intimate friends of the con tract
ing parties were present. Mr.
Wade Williamns and Miss Mary
Henderson stood with the. couple
and Miss Pearl Hester played
the wvedding march. After the
ceremony the bride and groom
left for the home of his parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Jas. F. Hepdricks,
-where a reception was. tendered

couple and both have numerous
friends who wish for them the

Mr. Editor:-I will give your

The heath of the community Is
generally good 'at this writing.
Mr. and Mrs. Wash Chastain,
who have been living in our
community for the past three
years, have moved to Mr. Chas

We regret having this good
neighbor and family to leave us.

Mr. Green's family will not

Alexander Moody, of Marietta

Well. well, we wonder what
has become of Mr. Holder's goat.
Miss Lillie Fortner, who has
been on the sick list for some
time, is improving some at this

Pleasant Grove section Is on a
great wonder because the Pump
kintown correspondent wrote
through the columns of The
Sentinel some time ago of the
bad depredation that had com
mitted in this community and
left unwritten as bqd or worse
depredatioan that was commit
ted right in his own town, So
we ask the enthusiastic corres
pondent of Pumpkintown to
please write the news from his
own big town the next time he
writes and if they lack a little
on the tail-end to fill out their
news, why finish it from our
section and we clod-heads will
not be on such a wonder. But
always get'the mote out of thine
own eye and then you can see
clear to take it out of thy broth
er's eye also. So let us hear
from Pumpkintown again.

A Letter Frca t
Joel H. Miller
MR. EDITOR: Not seein. a
communication from any~farn- -'
er -in this county, if you lk d'
permit I will make a break
for 1916, and bring to mind a
few things that have passed and'.
some at present and also some
on the 20th ult., at which I was
requested to be present, apnonI
representatives of the State Fari
mers Uion, and other interest
ed farmers of the state, -*bo
met on above .date at Columbia.
The object of 'the meeting was
to draft some bills for the better
ment -of the farmers of., this
state. Now as space forbids,
will not give particulars, but will
say that if the farmers don't
ask for what they want and
need they will never get it.
At present we have a state
warehouse system that has been
i operation for about 14 ntoth6
and during this time 171 bonded
warehouses have been built with
several thousand bales stored in
them and many far.'ners are'us
ing warehouse certificates to
draw money on at 5 or 6 per
cent. Also the insurance has
been reduced from more than
$3.00 per bale to $1.50. Besides
this the cotton is kept from the
spinner. The state is guaran.
teeing the grade and weight.
Texas has nearly the same
system of warehouses- as this
state and are now arranging to
sell to Germany 1,000,000 bales
at 27c. Our Warehouse Com
missioner, Hon. Jno. L. McLau
rin, informed me that he had
been offered 25c.for a large quan
tity of cotton by Germany thro'
the Ambassador butlMr. McLau
rin had hesitated on account of
the war conditions and the in,
fancy of the warehouse system.
It is my belief that-very soon
all the cotton states will have
this sane system which was so
badly wanted twenty years ago.
The past causes the farmer. to
be greatly distressed when he
reflects on being robbed of from
$30 to $40 per bale or more than
$20,000,000 on our cotton in this
state in 1914. Had we been in
proper condition this loss would
not have been.
Twenty-six years ago the Far
mers's Alliance demanded the
Sub-Treasury and haven't got
it yet. Up to the present time
there have b3en over one hun
dred rural credit bills introduced
in the Federal Congress. The
warehouse system of this state
and Texas and the proper Rural
credit combined ist he Sub- Treas
urv in full.
Some of the things we want in
the way of legislation is a sim
plified or common sense Rural
credit system that wvill be of
benefit to all, both tenant as
well as landlord. We wvant our
Legislature to standardize the
gradling of cotton in confo'rmity
to the lawvs on the same subject
passed by Congress. By doing
this every body will get the same
for their cotton. As !t Is now,
from $1.25 to $5.00 is lost on each
hale by undergrading. Just
think of the farmers of this
state losing from a million to
two million dollars in one year
by undergradingt
This is nothing less than open
dlaylight robbery of the cotton
growers for no other reason than
because we have no laws for our
protection.
Now let us get together and
see why wye are not protected
fronm such condition. If the
present Legislature now in ses
sion, does not do~ something tq~
help us we will remember the~m
when it comes to the polls to
select their successors.
/ Now, in conclusion, will add,
that the farmers ot Pickens Co.,
are called to meet at Pickens C.
H., on the 16th day of February
at 11 o'clock and at Easley at 3
p. mi., on same day. In addi
tion to the Rural credit system
and warehouse, the fertilizer
question wvill be ably discussed,
also tlre advisability of reorgan
izing the Farmers' Union.
Now, Mr. Editor, it you see
cause to print this it will be
greatly appreciated, and I wvill
conme again if sonme other don't
comec and take my place.
Joel H. Miller.
