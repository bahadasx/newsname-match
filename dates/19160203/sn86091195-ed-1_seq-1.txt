Facing Death
On the Desert
K. M. Kennedy received word by
phone from Mr. Willecke this morning
that the residents of the desert in the
neighborhood of Taber where there is
four feet of snow on the level, that
there is much stock and a number of
isolated families who are in a serious
condition for want of food and fuel.
» posse has been organized to relieve
the destitute families by the use of
snow shoes, but as there is very little
food or fuel available at Taber, only
900 pounds of flour, the condition of
these people will be calamitous is some
relief is not soon afforded them. Rail
road communication is impossible.
These unfortunate people are only
«bout twenty-five miles from Black
foot, and our citizens should do every
thing iii their power to relieve their
Buffering . and possibly prevent their
deaths.

IDAHO PALLS AFTER
THE LAND OFFICE
The committee appointed by the
'.dub of Commerce some weeks ago
to make a survey of the lands within
the district covered by the Unite 1
States land office at Blaekfoot is
sca ly to make a report.
Engineer Fred Kiefer was employed
by the committee to go over the roc'
ords and to make a map and accurate
data of the lands. The report and
the map will go to show that a great
er portion of the land subject to en
try is nearer Idaho Falls than Black
foot, and that this is the logical loca
tion. In addition to this the handsome
and commodious new federal building
in Idaho Falls which will be ready
for occupancy the last of February is
sufficiently large to take care of the
land office officials and can be oper
ated with much less expense than can
the office at the present location at
Blaekfoot. The committee is convinced
as well as others who have looked into
the situation, that Idaho Falls is the
logical point for the land office, and
every legitimate effort will be made to
secure the change of location from
Blaekfoot to this city
The committee, which is composed
of W. H. Kiefer and C. E. Olefqkhas
done a good deal of work and are
ready to make their report to the Club
of Commerce and to present their plan«,
maps and proposal to the government
officials at Washington.
Pocatello will likely be a contender
for the location of the land ofliec, as
the federal building in that city is
nearly ready for use. The greater
amount of lands yet to be occupied will
be an advantage, however, tha^Idaiio
Falls will present.
The map will show that north of
the line between townships 2 and 3
south, the acreage of unappropriulc.l
lands is 1,960,708 acres, and the acre
age south of this line is 717,315 acres
This is the logical line of division,
Blaekfoot • being very near -the ^geo
graphical center of the district, and
the figures show that of the unappro
priated lands of the district to the
north of this line, 73 per cent as against
27 per cent south of the line.
In considering the work for the land
office the uupcrfected entries to the
north of this line are. 992,315 acres, or
61 per cent of the entire acreage, as
against 648,612 acres, or 39 per cent,
: of the entire acreage to the south of
I the line.
j These figures may be arrived at from
the following statement of acreage of
unappropriated lands and unperfected
entries apportioned to the various coun
ties a* follows:

BODY OT BLACKFOOT BOY
IS TAKEN TO HOME
Accompanied by the parents, Mr. ami
Mrs. O. N. Oherrington, of Blaekfoot,
the body of Roy Oherrington, the young
man who was found dead near the
Oregon Short Line tracks early Thurs
day morning, wag taken to Blaekfoot,
Idaho, today. Although they had not
heard from their son since last Novem
ber, the parents were at a loss to un
derstand why he should have been
without money and walking along the
railroad traeks.
They said he had never bees out of
employment and at the time he wrote
last November was at a construction
camp in Nevada. He wrote that he
expeeted to work during the winter at
Jerome, Idaho. The parents declared
that be could have obtained money
from them at any time had he written
that he was in need.
The funeral took place Sunday after
noon from the home of the grief
stricken parents, who have the sincere
sympathy of the entire city.
Loses His Bister.
Mr. Thomas Ferguson received the
sad new« this week of bis only sister
who died very suddenly in California.
Deceased, who was almost qighty years
of age, spent last summer in Blaekfoot
visiting her two brothers, and while
here made many friends who will re
gret to hear of her death which was
la natural incident, as the old must die,
(and the young may die.
a
To Open or Not to Open,
the Question.
Last Saturday a petition to the city
council to open the moving picture
houses on Sunday evening was circulat
ed and quite generally signed by many
who could see no harm in Sunday
movies, which would be a great help
to the two houses now operating in
Blaekfoot who have a difficult time pay
ing their expenses for the high class
of pictures they are exhibiting. This
attempt of the picture houses to operate
on Sunday aroused the ire of the entire
ministry of the Grove City and brought
them together regardless of denomina
tion, and they deluged the city with
petitions in opposition to Sunday pic
tures. One minister informed us that
every house in the city but twenty
four were visited and the great ma
jority of the occupants, especially the
fair sex. were almost unanimous pro
testants against Sabbatical amusement
of any kind, believing that the churches
(should be the only attraction on the
[holy Sabbath Day.
The operators of the two show houses
have also circulated petitions for Sun
day performances and claim to have
enlisted many in support of their desire
to entertain the public Sunday even
ings. They have also employed Attor
ney Beebe to manage their Sabbatual
opening campaign and represent them
in the city council.
Awhile petitions for and against Sun
day picture shows have been generously
signed, there are a number of citizens
who are non-committal in the matter,
alleging that they are neither patrons
of churches or show houses. There are
others who freely admit that they see
no harm to church or the public in
Sunday picture shows, but care not to
oppose the unanimous desire of the min
istry and tfieir flocks to keep show
houses closed Sunday nights. There
are a number of non-church members
who are opposed to the ministry 's
(solid and aggressive opposition to the
.proposed Sunday movies, as they be
lieve people should be allowed to spend
their Sunday evenings according to the
dictates of their own conscience and
[allow the churchman to attend his
house of worship, and the non-church
man to attend his house of pleasure.
without any compulsion or dictation
Oppose Movies
The Ministerial Alliance held a ses
sion yesterday in which the matter of
the proposed moving picture ordinance
came up for consideration, and it is un
derstood that rigid opposition of that
body will be made to the passage of
the measure, notwithstanding the fact
that the petition has been signed by
the majority of the voters of the city.
A committee of three was selected to
confer with the proprietors of the
six moving picture theatres of the city
and present a demand that the shows
remain closed, and after that time the
project will be fought out before tin
council.
DR. HYDE RECOGNIZED
The county commissioners by a ma
jority vote appointed Dr. George E.
Hyde as assistant physician to fill the
vacancy caused by the promotion ot
Dr. C. N. Ray to the offiee of county
physician. Dr. Hyde is a resident of
ther Sugar House district. Before
making his home in this city he was
a prominent physician of Idaho. Dr.
Hyde will care for the line of werk
formerly under the direction of Dr.
Ray.—Deseret News.
George, better known as ' * Scaley ' '
Monroe, one of the pioneer farmers of
Mud Lake, was in Blaekfoot last Tues
day. He says the reports of the Mud
Lake flood are somewhat exaggerated,
and that while the Lake is uncomfort
ably high, there is no fear of much
damage.

whatever. They believe that sincere
chur.-h members will not desert the re
ligious influences of their mimisters
for Sunday pleasure resorts, but that
hundreds of local non-church patrons,
transients and others who have no
comfortable firesides these cold nights,
and are compelled to pass their Sunday
evenings in more expensive and far less
enlightening places than picture shows
are worthy of some consideration.
It was generally supposed that the
petition for Sunday movies would be
presented to the city council last Tues
day night, but it was not, and there
for. the opposition petition did not
materialize, though the custodians or
both were present.
We are reliably informed that the
petition of the Sunday picture shows
is still in circulation, but that it is 150
rtgr.atitrcs shy of the requisite number
^ness, but will give each other credit
of signers to be recognized by the city
council, and Attorney Beebe on another
page of this issue is advertising for the
legal number of voters favoring the
proposed Sun.Tay shows. Attorney
Beebe predicts that ere the next meet
ing of the city council his petition will
be adequately signed to appear before
the city solons, when its fate will be
decided according Tto their conscient
ious scruples as to whether it is best
to open or not to open picture shows
Sunday evenings.
For the next two weeks both peti
tions will be in circulation, and as there
are many justifiable reasons for them
both, we hope their wielders and ad
vocates will not be actuated by harsh
for being honest and unprejudiced in
their convictions as to what is best for
the greatest good to the greatest nun;
b«ir, and. With malice to none.
, The cities north and south of Black
foot have been agitated over this
Sunday opening law for several weeks,
and while majority petitions for open
ing picture houses have been presented
to the city councils, these governing
bodies have not yet dared to- override
the ministerial protests of their cities
and let the majority rule, which is an
undisputed evidence that the preachers
and their flocks run these cities, espec
ially in regard to the manner in which
people shall spend their Sabbaths.

puty with 502 pints of tanglefoot in
his possession, which he is charged with
attempting to smuggle into Bingham
county by the auto route, will plead
guilty before Judge Cownn next Sat

clemency possible. Wc are told that
an effort will be made by the county
