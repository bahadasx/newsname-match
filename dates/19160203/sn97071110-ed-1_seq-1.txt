ANNUAL INSTI-
TUTEJS HELD
LNE GROVE PEOPLE PARTICIPATE
Third Mid-Winter Chautauqua Draws
Large Crowds Despite Inclement
Weather and is Big Success
The members of the fine Grove
Methodist Episcopal church have adopt
ed a plan whereby they may pass
pleasantly and profitably some of the
afternoons and long evenings of mid
winter. During the period of cold
weather the orchardist enjoys more
leisure moments tftan at any other
season of the year, and three wintera
ago the fruitgrowers and church-goers
of Pine Grove conceived the idea that
a kind of wintertime Chautauqua would
be a benefiting diversion. I he success
of the first institute was so marked
that the event has been made annual,
and the third Annual Pine Grove Com
munity Institute was brought to an
end with religious services Sunday
evening.
But one should not gather the idea
that the institute, because it is held
under the auspices of the church, is
entirely for the spiritual well being of
the. Pine Grove orchardists. Problems
of every activity of the progressive
community are touched upon. The
Grange, the orchardist, the school, the
Sunday school and the church, all are
granted places on the program. And
while the church is one of Methodist
denominatiabn, no narrowness prevails
In religious belief of Pine Grove folk.
It is the purpose of the annual Institute
to broaden the viewpoint of the.rural
residents.
The institute has in fact outgrown
the bounds of the Pine Grove district,
and despite the snow-covered earth and
unusually cold weather sleigh-loads of
the residents of other rural sections
d the city were in daily attendance.
the lectures were a drawing card to
the women as well as the men of the
section.
The first meeting was held Friday
afternoon at the Grange hall under the
auspices of the Pina Grove Grange.
Iruman Butler delivered an address on
the activities of the Growers' Council
during the past year. C. A. Reed pre
sided. At the close of the meeting A.
Mason urged the apple men to make
a study of by-products. He declared
that it would be safe to predict that in
the future the pulp, now going to waste
at the local vinegar factory would be
dried and used as food for hogs.
Ire chief speaker at Friday night s
session was Prof. J. F. Brumbaugh, of
the Oregon Agricultural College, on
Python tegs the Law of Habit.
His lecture was preceded by a violin
erio by Geo. A. Wuest.
Up. Saturday morning Prof. Brum
baugh talked to the ranchera on "Rural
Laws," and a comet solo was rendered
by A. J. Graff.
I he program for Saturday was as
follows: Songs by the school children ;,
address, "The Essentials of Life," Dr.
Carl G. Poney, president of Willamette
University; vocal solo, by Mrs. M.
Thrane; and an address. "Thinking
polks, H. U. Perry, superintendent
of Sunday schools of The Dallies dis
trict of the Methodist church.
Sunday was devoted to a musical pro
gram and religious services. The pro
gram for the morning was as follows:
Sunday school in charge of W. V.
Keck; instrumental solo, Francis Van
nier; violin deut, Misses Leila Radford
and Maud Fernn; institute sermon;
H. O. Perry ; and sung by the male
quartet of the church.
A feature ot the program, "rtutn,

weeks, when the following will partici

The closing address was delivered by
Mr. Perry.
A community basket luncheon was
enjoyed on Saturday noon. Prof. N.

day afternoon session, and on Sunday
evening, Russell A. McCully was chair
man.
VIRGINIA APPLE MAN
PRAISES FREDRICY
(By C. Purcell McCue, of Virginia, in
American Fruit Grower)
omcanied by a friend, I went to
railroad office in Portland, Oregon,
inauire about the trip 4o Hood
River. The agent gave us the infor
mation asked for, and also his card to
the railroad agent at Hood River, Mr
H. Fredncy, who, by the way, was
tvpical of the people we met in the
west a "booster" for the country and
its resources.
On our arrival at Hood River we
went to Mr. Fredricy, and he was most
courteous. He phoned for an automo
bile for us, and my friend and I went
to get dinner at the hotel, with the
understanding that be would accom
pany us on our trip if he could get
away. When we were almost through
dinner, Mr. Fredricy came up to say that
he would go with us, and, as he knew
the countrv and practically all of the
eiowers. his presence made it much
mnra interesting for US.
We took a drive up the left band side
Of the valley, then across, ana down
the right band side, lbe land on
which the orchards are planted is con
siderably above the Columbia river
about 200 feet and the drive up to this
elevation was on, good roads.
The first thing that attracted our
attention waa the fact that some of
the orchards were in red clover, and
when we asked bow this happened, we
were told that they did not always
clean cultivate their land. There were
hoes in aome of the orchards, and Mr,
Fredricv said to the driver, "That is
something you never saw a few years
,,
ago.
After tbia we came to a big eorooina
tion cold storage and packing house.
We met the manager, and be was very
kind, abowed us all over the plant and
answered a good many Questions for
The plant was an? air-cooled cold
storage, where the apples were run in
from the orchard as they came from
the trees. They packed as many as
they could as they were orougni n,
and then sorted the others as an or
chard run, and kept on packing them,
as the manager said, ometimea into
January.
There were about 86 Japs at work
sorting and packing, and two big ma-'
chines doing the siting, with a few
Americans aa foremen; bo nailers,
markers, etc. These Japs were fur
nished a bunk-bouse, and paid $2.50
per day if they could pack as many as
100 boxes per day. Their pay was
scaled down if they packed less.
Everyone waa busy and everything
was running aa smoothly as possible.
None but perfect apples were put in
the boxes. This requisite of good
packing is much easier to obtain there
than with us. The Japs who do the
packing have absolutely no interest in
ihe number of apples they discard.
They are told what to do and they do it
with an exactness that is remarkable.
Ihe result ia a fine pack which we do
not see in the East as often as we could
wish.
Now I feel that I must aay what
struck me most about western people
not as individuala but as a whole, they
all aaid they had a wonderful country
and wonderful apples. They believed
it, talked it. and boosted their country
on all occasions. You will see this by
the way this railroad man was glad to
show us over the valley, tell us ol the
advantages, and never mention one dis
advantage that the country had. He
was not interested in the orchards
except for what they furnished his
railroad to ship.
JACOB MERLE HON
ORED BY FELLOWS
Drawing bis inspiration, aa he savs
from Fred Dundee, of Portland, for
whom he was formerly employed, Jacob
uerie, oi me garage firm of r oust a
Merle, has returned from Portland
fully decided to equip in Hood River
one of the most up to date garages of
the state, in au days be and Mr. roust
will have installed cylinder grinding
machines and other apparatus that will
keep automobile repair business at
home.
"Fred Dundee," says Mr. Merle,
deserves unstinted praise for what he
has done in setting a pace for automo
bile repair and garage men of the
state. When I was with Mr. Dnudee
he was working but 10 men. Todav he
employs 200, and his work is of such an
ecxellent nature that be is drawing
work irom territory that has always
been patronizing the east."
Both Mr. Foust and Mr. Merle were
in Portland last week. The former
spent the first of the week at the auto
mobile show and the latter was there
the later part of the week. Mr. Merle
attended the organization meeting of
a u 10 mot He repair and garage men, and
was honored by election to the execu
tive board. He was the lucky guest at
the banquet of rubber men. drawing a
$35 electric born. Mr. Merle has al
ways been known to his friendB as
Lucky Jake."
Foust & Merle are local handlers of
the Studebaker automobile. On or
about March 15 they will receive a car
load of this popular make of automo
bile. The shipment will include fours.
sixes and one delivery wagon. - One of
the features of the Studebaker is that
the salesman give to each purchaser a
service card, guaranteeing inspection
and care of the machine for one year s
time. These cards are later sent to
other dealers, and naturally each local
agency is keen on making the best pos
sible service record.
We have received information,"
says Mr. Merle, "that an advance may
be expected in the prices of all auto
mobiles. There will possibly be a
small increase in the price in the Stud
ebaker. The gist of our advice in the
face of such information will be this:
"If you are going to buy a car, do so
at once. If you purchase now, you
will get your machine at the prevailing
price of today"
NOTED HUMORIST
WILL LECTURE HERE

pices of the Hood River schools.
Dr. Crothers is to the world of liter
ature what Maud Powell is to the

probably the foremost literary genius
who ever will have visited or spoken
in Hood River. The reserved seat
ticket sale will begin on Friday, .Febru
ary 4, at Clarke's drug store.

U
ELECTION INTER
EST SIMMERS
RE-ELECTIONS WILL BE SOUGHT
Shoemaker Will Again Make Race All
the Offices Except Two Will
Be Filled
While no aspirant to office has as yet
made formal tiling of his intentions the
local political pot is beginning to siml
mer and prospective candidates are
beginning to jockey for a start in the
preliminary races of the May primar
ies. Successors to all county ollicers
must be elected except in the case of
County Judge E. E. Stanton and As
sessor Jasper Wickham both of whom
will serve two more years.
The term of Circuit Judge W. L.
Bradshaw will expire at the end of this
year. While no expression has been
made by Judge Bradshaw himself, hm
friends here are of the opinion that ho
will be a candidate to succeed himself.
Judge Bradshaw is one of the most
popular circuit judges in Oregon and
has held office for four consecutive
terms.
County Clerk Kent Shoemaker aged
24 and the youngest clerk in the taste,
will be a candidate to succeed himself.
Mr. Shoemaker has been an efficient
and faithful officer and has won a wide
spread esteem and popularity.
1 nomas F. Johnson, too, will be a
candidate for re-election to the office of
sheriff. While Mr. Johnson is at the
present time in a sate of Bomewhat in
decision, be says that he will enter the
race if the people desire him. He is
now finishing his third term of office
and has grown stronger with the peo
ple .of the county each year. At the
election in 1914 he received the largest
number of votes of any candidate.
The terms of incumbents of the fol
lowing offices will expire with the end
of this year. Prof. C. D. Thompson,
county school superintendent; Consta
ble E. S. dinger and Justice of the
Peace A. C. Buck. Mr. dinger will
be a candidate for re-election. Judge
Buck, however, says that he does not
expect to again seek office.
Prof. Thompson, who received notice
of his appointment as county agricul
turist of Josephine county Monday,
will tender his resignation. Prof. L.
F. Henderson, Mrs. Mary Frazier, B.
L. Murphy and L. B. Gibson are being
mentioned for the place.
Terms of the county surveyor and
county treasurer will expire this year.
Both offices are now vacant. Mrs.
F. A. Bishop is mentioned as the logi
cal successor to her husband, and it is
probable that she will receive appoint
ment. DISLOYALTY WILL
BE DISCIPLINED
A step forward In the cooperative or
ganization of sales agencies seems
probable in all Northwestern fruit sec
tions the coming year. While disci
plining unloyal members of sales
agencies has been mentioned in the
past and in caseg has even been incor
porated in contracts between associa
tions and members, rules have never
been enforced. However, from the
present prevailing sentiment and the
expressions of local sales agency offi
cials, the Apple Growers Association
will probably begin the marketing of
next season's crop with its affiliated
members bound to the organization by
a contract, which will provide that the
member, in cae he violates the con
tract and ships independently or
through some other agency, will auto
matically be expelled.
Ihe hrst actual steps toward the
disciplining of assoication members
were tBken last week, when the 25
local unit organizations of the Yakima
Valley fruit Association adopted by
unanimous vote of their trustees to
summarily drop from their membership
list unloyal growers.
' Idaho and Wenachehe are taking
the eame point," says Wilmer Sieg,
sales manager of the local association.
and will undoubtedly take a similar
stand. The greatest drawback to the
Northwestern apple industry is the in
dependent shipper. Organizations base
their calculations on tonnage furnished
acording to contracts, and when the
tonnage of those who withdraw to ship
through other sources is deducted from
the total counted on in the first instance,
the ability of a sales agency to guage
its marketing machinery is cut short
proportionately. With the representa
tive shipping concerns bringingbout
these new rulings that will protect the
loyal member, independent shippers in
the future will have no chance.
"A contract is a valid document and
must be protected, and while organiza
tions do not want to cause or create
trouble they must do something to pro
tect the shipper who is loyal. '1 his
can only be done by the elimination of
the unloyal grower. Ihe action of the
Yakima association is one in the right
direction; it will create stability, 'the
movement has the support of tne gov
ernment committee that has been
working in the Northwest on an inves
tigation of marketing conditions and
who have asserted that they found the
biggest proportion of damage to mar
kets caused by growers who try to ship
and work independently."
SKI AND SLED
ENTHUSIASTS BOLD
With the long continued cold weather
and the .heavy snow blanket covering
the bills and valleys, local people have
been growing bolder and bolder in their
search for winter sports with an in
creasing thrill. For the first time the
East Side range was climbed Saturday
afternoon, Hans Hoerlein, a ski enthu
siast, scaling the bald top, where he
says the wind was blowing a gale that
cut like a razor. Mr. Hoerlein re
turned down the 30 per cent grade at a
terrific speed.
Dr. C. H. Jenkina was the first to
pilot a bob-sled down the tortuous way
of the East Side grade. Dr. Jenkins,
an enthusiastic devotee of coasting,
made the long run successfully Sunday
morning.
