WILL REDDOE RATES
(Mty Insurance Itate Will lower
When Supply of Water Is In
creased by New Heservolr
The question has recently been
raised regarding the lowering of In
surance rates In Alliance, predicted
by local Insurance men two years
ago, when the question of purchasing
a new auto chemical truck and new
pump for the city water department
was voted upon. The voters of the
city expressed themselves as being In
favor of both.
The state laws do not allow Insur
ance companies to agree on uniform
rates on property, and for that reason
It would not be lawful for the insur
ance men to make stated rates on any
building. However, it can be stated
on good authority that whenever the
city installs the new reservoir which
has been contemplated and the new
pump is placed In the plant, provid
ing a larger storage of water for fire
fighting purposes, that insurance
rates will come down.
The proposed "anti-discrimination
law" which was killed by the last leg
islature was designed to prevent dis
crimination and to lower the rates.
It is stated on good authority that
the law of this kind which was pass
ed in Iowa has reduced rates there
one-third. This law will undoubted
ly come up again this fall and stands
a good chance or carrying.

When a Mr. Dexter, from Oklaho
ma, asked the ticket agent at Denver

th na i e Alliance and he forthwith
told him that he meant Alliance, Ne
braska. "Ne. I don't," he said, "I mean
Lyons. Colorado."
"There is no such place in Colora
do," said the agent and he banded
him a ticket to Alliance, quoting the
pric of it. Dexter protested again
saying he knew it was only about fif
ty miles to Lyons but he accepted the
ticket, paid for it, boarded the Bur
lington train and landed In Alliance.
He remained here till Tuesday
when he returned to Denver determ
ined this time to buy a ticket to his

SCOTTSBLUFF BEET CROP
Company Pay 2,148,000 to Farm
ers Total Output of Factory
for 1H15 Is 700.000 HagM
The Scottsbluff Sugar Company of
Scottsbluff. Nebr.. paid $2,148,300 to
f(armers for sugar beets in the year
1915. In addition it paid over $60.-
000 to employes. The company ban
died 246.000 tons of beets at the
factory and manufactured 700,000
bags of sugar, each bag weighing 100
pounds. The company furnished 9,
784 cars of freight to shipment over
railroads. It paid an average of
f 5.65 a ton for beets for a crop that
averaged twelve tons to the acre. The
acreage planted was 32,000 and the
total yield was 382.000 tons. Of
that amount 118,000 tons were shin
ned to a factory in Colorado. The
company Is building a factory at Ger
ing, Nebr.. to care for the increasing
crop raised by farmers.
The company produced 100,000
tons of pulp which was fed to 3.070
head of cattle and 9.136 head of
sheep.
Sanford Stark, financial agent of
the company, shipped 1.400 cars of
sugar, 500 bags to the car. "We es
timate in working beets," said Mr.
Stark, "ten acres to a person, though
this is rather more than one should
work, but occasionally a farmer with
a small acreage works with his own
help. All this gives employment to
3,800 people during the crop. Thous
ands of teams are employed during
the crop, and this gives work to
many men. A good many beet work
ers are women and children. They
make good wages, as they receive $20
an acre for hand work on a crop and
between times they work In harvest
fields and at other work, aad many of
them are getting to be farmers them
selves, some renting and some are
buying land.

farmers from eastern Nebraska and
from some of the eastern states In
western Nebraska opportunities.
Mr. Lovelace met with officers of
the Comemrelal Club and with real
estate dealers of the city and various
plans were suggested to help settle

that a meeting will be called at an
early date to take up the matter In
an official way and to arrive at deft
nlte plans.
Mr. Lovelace stated that the com
mercial club of Sheridan, Wyo., has
raised a large fund to be used in
furthering the interests of their sec
tton of the country in this regard and
that a meeting has been called to be
held soon, at which they will meet
with H. B, Howard, of Omaha, Immi-

WAS NOT ROBERT WHISTON
Report Circulated BenVctlng o:i
Evangelist Who Held Meetings
Here Said to Be Erroneous
Members of the Alliance Christian
church feel that an Injustice has been
done them in the circulating of a im
port that Evangelist Robert Whlston.
who conducted a very successful re
vival meeting here a few years ar'.
at the time Rev. Woten was pHSior
of the church, figured as tbe defend
ant recently In a sensational divorce
case In Hamilton county. Nebraska.
It seems evident that the incorrect
report occurred through the fact that
dispatches la eastern papers report
ing the divorce proceedings used the
name Whlston without mentioning
the defendant's first name, and while
local parties have no first hand in
formation they think it Is probable
that the Whlston referred to It Bur
ton Whlston. a brother of Robert
Whtston. tbe evangelist who con
ducted the meetings here.
In recent Issues ef the Christ lau
Standard, published at Cincinnati,
and the Christian Evangelist, pub
lished at 8C Louis. J wo of the big
gest official publications of the Chris
tian church, repeated . reference la
made to Evangelist Robert Whlston
and the success he Is having In the
meetings he has been conducting at
various places. In the Christian
Standard of January 15, reference Is
made to meetings at Flint, Mich., at
which he was being assisted by Mrs.
Whlston. In a moro recent Issue of
one of the papers mention Is made
lhat owing to the cancellation of a
date in Michigan he will be available
for a proposed meeting In an eastern
Nebraska city some time during the
month of February.
Among the members of the local
church are quite a number who are
personally acquainted with Evangel
ist Whlston and his wife and they
state that Mrs. Robert Whlston's
Christian name Is "Ruby," whereas
the newspaper reports referring to
the divorce proceedings give the first
name of Mrs. Whlston, the plaintiff,
as "Maude."
Members of the church here feel
that there is no Justification In the
publication of reports which in a way
might reflect on the local Institution
without having accurate information
or without having tbe reports con
firmed.
HUNDREDS INQUIRING
Announcement of Opening at North
Platte Project Brings Flood of
Mall from over United States
Announcements made last week of
the restoration to entry of certain
lands reclaimed by the government
along the North Platte project has
resulted In a flood of mall into the
land office in this city from all over
the United States. Within two days
after the announcement was first
made in the Herald last week there
were nearly five hundred Inquiries
received at the land office and tbe
number has since then nearly dou
bled. As It Is almost impossible to an
swer each letter individually, Regis
ter T. J. O'Keefe has asked the de
partment at Washington for a supply
of tbe official notices originally sent
out. As these notices are a little bit
vague to the average citizen a clrcul

uas been prepared and will be n
closed with the official department

These notices, which are signed by
T. 1. O'Keefe, register, and J. C.

the following lsformatlon:
Relating to the lands to be opened
to entry through this office on March
24,-1916, the public press has adver
tised that 14,000 acres are opened
to homestead entry. The statement
la misleading to those who are not
familiar with the status of these
lands. An examination of the rec
ord shows about 4,000 acres open to
entry in the territory Involved. The
tracts are called "Farm Units' and
contain from 10 to 160 acres: most
of them contain 80 to 100 acres each
These lands are Just north of the
Platte river and the llui linfeion rr.il

northeast from Bayard, Nebraska, In
Township 21 N., Range 51, are 12 of

ADDRESS Oil DAIRYING
Dairy Extension Man visit Box Butte
County and Uve Instructive
and KntcrtAlning lectures
Very Interesting and instructive
addresses on the subject of dairying
were made at special meetings of the
Box Butte County Farmers' Associa
tion, on Tuesday and Wednesday of
this week, by Prof. D. H. Tropps, a
specialist who devotes his entire
time to the dairy interests, In the em
ploy of the federal government and
co-operating with the State Agricul
tural College of Nebraska.
F. M. Seidell, county agent of the
association, presided at the meetings
and Introduced the speaker. Twenty
five Interested farmers attended the
meeting Tuesday, which was held la
llemingford. Tbe meeting Wednes
day afternoon was held In the coun
cil chamber of tbe city hall in Alli
ance. The attendance was not large
but the Interest was fine, aa might be
expected for an address that was
both Instructive and practical.
Mr. Propps is a ready speaker and
adapts his talks to the audiences that
be faces. Some times they are made
up exclusively of farmers, and again
they are composed largely of business
men. He is loaded with Information
on the subject which be discusses.
While he does not, In one address,
tell all he knows on tbe subject, he
knows all he tells, that is, be Is sure
of the accuracy of his statements.
He began his lecture in Alliance by
referring to the great awakening In
Nebraska regarding tbe matter of
dairying the Interest now not being
confined to tbe eastern part of the
state but being evident In this part,
also. At a dairy meeting held In
Chadron last Suturd.iy, seventy were
present. He emphasised the fact that
conditions. in eastern and western
Nebraska are quite different, but
that western Nebraska may be a suc
cessful dairy country. the people
want it to be, as well as the eastern
part of the state.
Mr. Propps is au enthusiast on tne
subject of dairying, as might be ex
pected, but Is not an extremist. He
is rather conservative in bis state
ments, particularly when giving ad
vice to persons who contemplate go
ing Into dairying. His address was
marked thruout with the practical In
the Information, suggestions and ad
vice given. His advice to persons
who wish to enter tbe dairy business
was to "grow into U," rather than to
"go into It," beginning on a small
scale and enlarging as they learned.
Persons who like dairying can make
a great success or It; those who do
not like It will never succeed in It.
Co-operation Is "an Important ele
ment of success. --
In closing his address, Mr. Propps
called attention to tbe revival of In
terest In exhibits of dairy and farm
products at county fairs, which he
highly commended.' and the new In
terest that has beeu aroused by the
exhibits ut t:ilrs made by members
of boys' and glrln' clubs. He urged
farufr to consult the county farm
a cent regurclnv d.-.lry ii'iitters. as
well as to other Uiiuks relating to
agricultural matters, and ikcou
mended that Bleps be taken to hold
a county fair the coming season,
making exhibits of dairy and farm
products a strong feature.
Charles Eveland, who was brought
to St. Joseph's hospital in Alliance
Wednesday of last week, died at the
hospital Sunday niht. Pneumonia
was the c.iube of death. Two daugh
ters were at his beUnide at the time
of death. The remains were shipped
Monday night to Colorado Springs.
Colo., his former hom, for burial in
the family lot at Colorado Springs
cemetery.
