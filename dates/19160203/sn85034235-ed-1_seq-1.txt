SYNOPSIS.
Christopher BePew, a tenderfoot, starts
for the Klondike in a gold rush and pluck
ily works at the back breaking toil of
packing freight.
He meets a beautiful girl, Joy Gastell,
deserts his own party, and he and Shorty,
a new acquaintance, hire out to two
wealthy prospectors. Joy has nicknamed
him "Smoke "
Smoko and Shorty befriend a man nam
ed, Breck and nearly perish in attempting
to cross Lake Lebarge because of the
uselessness of their employers.
Smoke and Shorty take command by
force and get through to Dawson City,
where they are discharged. On Breck's
Up they stampede for Squaw creek.
They overtake Joy Gastell and her fa
ther. To help the Sea Lion crowd Joy
treacherously leads them away from
Squaw creek. •
Smoke saves the girl's feet from freez
ing. He and Shorty by mistake Jump a
miner's claim and lose it. Then Smoke
finds Surprise lake, the bottom of which
is covered with gold.
Smoke is shot at, witnesses the murder
of a miner by the unknown marksman
and is arrested for murder himself.
Breck shows a Surprise lake nugget,
the impromptu court is stampeded, and
Smoke's life is saved. Smoke wins money
at roulette.
He continues to win. and the gamblers
buy him off His system was based on
the discovery that the roulette wheel was
warped.
Prompted by Joy Gastell. Smoke enters
a race for a million dollar claim against
some of the best dog mushers.
At a critical moment Joy supplies Smoke
with a fresh dog team, and he runs a
dead heat with Big Olaf for the claim.
Smoke goes to Surprise lake. He falls
into a crevasse in a glacier, and a miner,
Carson, makes heroic efforts to rescue
him.
Smoke cuts a rope to save Carson, falls
himself and is caught in a pocket below,
from which he is rescued by Carson and
Joy.
CHAPTER XV.
The Starving Tribe.
T HE way led steeply up through
deep, powdery snow that was
unniarred by sled track or
moccasin Impression. Smoke,
in the lead, pressed the fragile crystals
down under his fat, short snowsboes.
The task required lungs and muscle,
and he flung himself into it with all his
strength.
Behind, on the surface he packed,
strained the string of six dogs, the
steam Jets of their breathing attesting
their labor and the lowness of the tem
perature. Between the wheel dog and
the sled toiled Shorty, his weight di
vlded between the guiding gee pole and
the haul, for he was pulling with the
dogs. Every half hour he and Smoke
exchanged places, for the snowshoe
work was even more arduous than that
of the gee pole.
This was their sixth day out from
the lively camp of Mucluc, on the Yu
kon And now they were breasting the
big divide past the Bald buttes, where
the way would lead them down Por
cupine creek to the middle reaches of
Milk river. Higher up Milk river, It
was fairly rumored, were deposits of
copper. And this was their goal—a
hill of pure copper half a mile to the
right and up the first creek after Milk
river issued from a deep gorge to flow
across a heavily timbered stretch of
bottom.
Smoke was tn the lead, and the small
scattered spruce trees were becoming
scarcer and smaller when he saw one.
drtid and l>one dry, that stood in their
path There was no need for speech
His glance to Shorty was aoknowl
edged by a stentorian "Whoa!" The
dogs stood in the traces till they saw
WRITE for the BANNER'S ad
vertising rates. They are within
reach of any man. Find out!
Shorty begin to undo the sled lashings
and Smoke attack the dead spruce with
on ax, whereupon the auimaJs dropped
In the snow and curled into balls, the
bush of each tail curved to cover four
padded feet and an ice rimmed muzzle.
In twenty minutes from the time they
halted the meal was ready to eat
"About forty below," Shorty mumbled
through a mouthful of beans. "Hope
it don't get colder—or warmer neither.
It's Just right for trail breakln'.''
Smoke did not answer. His own
mouth full of beans, be had chanced to
glance at the lead dog lying half a
dozen feet away. That gray, frosty
wolf was gazing at him with the In
finite wistfulness and yearning that
glimmer and haze so often In the eyes
of northlnud dogs. Smoke knew it
well, but never got over the unfathom
able wonder of it.
As if to shake off the hypnotism he
set down his plate and coffee cup, went
to the sled and began opening the dried
fish sack.
"Hey!" Shorty expostulated. "What
'r* you doin'?"
"Breaking ail law, custom, precedent
and trail usage," Smoke replied. 'T in
goiug to feed the dogs In the middle of
the day—just this once. Bright there
has been talking to me, telling me all
untenable things with those eyes of
him."
Shorty laughed skeptically. "Oh, if
it's a hunch, go to it A man's always
got to follow his hunches."
"It Isn't a bunch. Shorty. Bright Just
sort of got on my imagination for a
couple of twists. He told me more in
one minute with those eyes of ids than
I could read in the books in a thousand
years. His eyes were a-crawl with the
secrets of life. They were just squirm
ing and wriggling there. The trouble
is I almost got them, and then I didn't.
I'm no wiser than I was before, but I
was near them."
"Boiled down into simple American,
you got a hunch," Shorty insisted.
"Somethin's goin' to happen before
the day is out You'll see. An' them
dried fish'll have a bearin'."
'You've got to show me," said
Smoke.
"No, I ain't The day'll take care of
itself an' show you. Now, listen to
wbat I'm tellin' you. I got a hunch
myself out of your hunch. I'll bet
eleven ounces against three ornery
toothpicks I'm right"
'You bet the toothpicks, and I'll bet
the ounces," Smoke returned.
"Nope. That'd be plain robbery. I
win. I know a hunch when it tickles
me. Before the day's out somethin' 'll
happen, an' them fish'll have a mean
in'."
An hour later they cleared the divide,
dipped down past the Bald buttes
through a .sharp elbow canyon and
took the steep, open slope that drop
ped Into Porcupine creek. Shorty, in
the lead, stopped abruptly, and Smoke'
wboned the dogs. Bfeneath them, com
ing up, was a procession of humans,
scattered and draggled, a quarter of a
mile long.
'They move like It was a funeral,"
Shorty noted.
'They've no dogs," said Smoke.
'Yep; there's a couple of men pullin'
on a sled."
'See that fellow fall down? There's
something the matter, Shorty, and
there must be 200 of them."
"Look at 'em stagger ns If they was
soused. There goes another."
"It's a whole tribe. There are chil
dren there."
"Smoke, I win," Shorty proclaimed.
"A hunch is a hunch, an' you can't
beat it There she comes. Look at
her—surgin' up like a lot of corpses."
The mass of Indians at sight of the
two men had raised a weird cry of joy
and accelerated its pace.
"They're sure tolerable woozy," com
mented Shorty. "See 'em failin' down
in lumps an' bunches."
"Look at the face of that first one,"
Smoke said. "It's starvation—that's
what's the matter with them. Tbey've
eaten their dogs."
"What'11 we do? Run for it?"
"And leave the sled and dogs?"
Smoke demanded reproachfully.
"They'll sure eat us If we don't.
They look hungry enough for It Hello,
old skeeziks! What's wrong with you?
Don't look at that dog that way. No
cookin' pot for him—savvy?"
The forerunners were arriving and
crowding about them, moaning and
plainting in an unfamiliar Jargon. To
Smoke the picture was grotesque and
horrible. It was famine unmistakable.
Their faces, hollow cheeked and skin
stretched, were so many death's heads.
More and more arrived and crowded
about until Smoke and Shorty were
hemmed in by the wild crew. Their
ragged garments of skin and fur were
cut and slashed away, and Smoke
knew the reason for It when he saw a
wizened child on a squaw's back that
sucked and chewed a strip of filthy
fur.
"Keep off there—keep back!" Shorty
yelled, falling back on English after
futile attempts with the little Indian
lie did know.
Bucks and squaws and children tot
tered and swayed on shaking legs and
continued to urge in, their mad eyes
swimming with weakness and burning
with ravenous desire. A Woman,
moaning, staggered past Shorty and
fell with spread and grasping arms on
the sled. An old man followed her,
panting and gasping, with trembling
hands striving to cast off the sled lash
Ings and get at the grub sacks bo
oeath. A young man with a naked
jnlfe tried to rush in, but was flung
back by Smoke. The whole mass
pressed In upon them, and the fight
was on.
At first Smoke and Shorty shoved
and thrust and threw back. Then they
used the butt of the dog whip and
their-fists on the food mad crowd. And
all this against a background of moan
mg and wailing women and children
Here and there in a dozen places the
sled lashings were cut. Men crawled
in on their bellies, regardless of a rain
of kicks and blows, and tried to drag
out the grub. These had to be picked
up bodily and flung back. And such
was their weakness that they fell con
tinually under the slightest pressures
or shoves. Yet they made no attempt
to injure the two men who defended
the sled.
It was the utter weakness of the In
dians that saved Sinoße and Shorty
from being overborne. In five minutes
the wall of upstanding, on-struggling
Indians had been changed to heaps of
fallen ones, that moaned and gibbered
in the snow and cried and sniveled as
their staring, swimming eyes focused
on the grub that meant life to them
MX
r*
"Me Carluk. Me good Siwash."
and that brought the shiver to their
lips. And behind it all arose the wail
ing of the women and children.
"This is terrible," Smoke muttered.
"I'm all bet up," Shorty replied.
"I'm real sweaty. An' now what 'r'
we goin' to do with this ambulance
outfit?"
Smoke shook his head, and then the
problem was solved for JMtn. An In
eel on Smoke
and in it Smoke could see the struggle
of sanity to assert itself. Shorty re
membered having punched the other
eye, which was already swollen shut.
The Indian raised himself on his elbow
and spoke: ■
"Me Carluk. Me good Siwash. Me
savvy Boston man plenty. Me plenty
buugry. All people plenty hungry. All
people no savvy Boston man. Me sav
vy. Me eat grub now. All people eat
grub now. We buy 'm grub. Got'm
plenty gold. No got 'm grab. Sum
mer saimou no come Milk river. Win
ter caribou no come. No grab. Me
make 'm talk all people. Mo tell 'm
plenty Boston man come Yukon. Bos
ton man have plenty grub. Boston
man like 'm gold. We take 'm gold,
go Yukon, Boston man give 'm grub.
Plenty gold. Me savvy Boston man
like'm gold."
He began fumbling with wasted fin
gers at the drawstring of a pouch he
took from his belt.
"Too much make 'm noise," Shorty
broke in distractedly. "You tell 'm
squaw, you tell'm papoose, shut'm up
mouth."
Carluk turned and addressed the
wailing women. Other bucks, listen
ing, raised their voices authoritatively,
and slowly the squaws stilled and still
ed the children near to them. Carluk
paused from fumbling the drawstrings
and held up his fingers many times.
"Him people make 'm die," he said.
And Smoke, following the count,
knew that seventy-five of the tribe had
starved to death.
"Me buy 'm grub," Carluk said as
he got the pouch open and drew out a
large chunk of heavy metal. Others
were following his example, and on
every side appeared similar chunks.
Shorty stared.
"Great jiminy!" he cried. "Copper!
Raw, red eopperl An' they think it's
gold!"
"And the poor devils banked every
thing on it." Smoke muttered. "Look
at it. The chunk there weighs forty
pounds. They've got hundreds of
pounds of it, and they've 'carried It
when they didn't have strength enough
to drag themselves. Look here. Shorty.
We've got to feed them."
"Huh! Sounds easy. But how about
statistics? You an' me has a month's
grub, which is six meals times thirty,
which is ISO meals. Here's 200 In
dians. with real, full grown appetites.
How can we give'm one meal even?"
"There's the dog grab," Smoke an
swered. "A couple of hundred pounds
of dried salmon ought to help out
We've got to do it. They've pinned
their faith on the white man. you
know."
"Sure, an' we can't throw'm down,'
Shorty agreed. "An' we got two nasty
jobs cut out for us, each just about
twicet ns nasty as the other. One of
us has got to make a run of it to Muc
luc an' raise a relief. The other has to
stay here an' run the hospital an* most
likely be eaten. Don't let It slip yonr
noodle that we've been six days gettin*
here. an', travelln' light an* all played
ont. it can't be made back in less 'n
three days."
For a minute Smoke pondered the
rniies of the way they had come, vi
sioning the miles In terms of time
measured by bis capacity for exertion.
"I can get there tomorrow night," he
announced.
"All right," Shorty acquiesced cheer
fully. "An, I'll stay an' be eaten."
"But I'm going to take one fish each
for the dogs," Smoke explained, "and
one meal for myself."
"An' you'll sure need it if you make
Muclue tomorrow night."
Smoke, through the medium of Car
luk. strted the program. "Make fires,
long fires, plenty fires," he concluded.
"Plenty Boston man stop Mucluc. Bes
ten man much good. Boston man plen
ty grill). Five sleeps I come back
plenty grub. This man. his name
Shorty, very good friend of mine. He
stop here. He big boss—savvy?"
Carluk nodded and interpreted.
"All grub stop here. Shorty, he give
m grub. He boss—savvy?"
Carluk interpreted, and nods and gut
tural cries of agreement proceeded
from the men.
Smoke remained and managed until
the full swing of the arrangement was
under way. Those who were able
crawled or staggered in the collecting
of firewood. Long Indian fires were
built that accommodated all. Shorty,
aided by a dozen assistants, with a
short club bandy for the rapping of
hungry knuckles, plunged into the
cooking.
First, a tiny piece of bacon was dis
tributed all around and, next, n spoon
ful of sugar to cloy the edge of their
razor appetites. Soon on a circle of
fires drawn about Shorty many pots
of beans were boiling, and he, with a
wrathful eye for what he called the
renigers, was frying and apportioning
the thinnest of flapjacks.
"Me for the big cookin'," was his
farewell to Smoke. "You just keep
a-hikin'. Trot all the way there an'
run all the way .back. It'll take you
today an' tomorrow to get there, and
you can't be back inside three days
more. Tomorrow tbey'll eat the last
of the dogfish, an' then there'll be
nary a scrap for three days. You
gotta keep a-comin', Smoke; you gotta
keep a-comin'."
CHAPTER XVI.
The Hanging of Cultus George.
M IDNIGHT had gone a quarter
of an hour in the Annie
Mine. The main room was
comfortably crowded, while
roaring stoves, combined with lack of
ventilation, kept the big room iusaui
tarily warm. The click of chips and
the boisterous play at the craps table
furnished a monotonous background
of sound to the equally monotonous
rumble of men's voices where they sat
and stood about and talked iq groups
came the rollicking strains of a Vir
ginia reel played by a piano and a fid
dle.
Cultus George, a big, strapping Cir
cle City Indian, leaned distantly and
dourly against the log wall. He was
a civilized Indian, if living like a
white man connotes civilization, and
he was sorely offended, though the of
fense was of long standing.
For years he had done a white man's
work, had done it alongside of white
men and often had done it better than
they did. He wore the same pants
they wore, the same hearty woolens
and heavy shirts. He sported as good
a watch as they, parted his short hair
on the side and ate the same food
bacon, beaus and flour—and yet he was
denied their greatest diversion and re
ward—namely, whisky.
Cultus George was a money earner.
He had staked claims and bought and
sold claims. He had been grubstaked,
and he had accorded grubstakes. Just
now he was a dog mustier and freight
er, charging 28 cents a pound for the
winter haul from Sixty Mile to Muc
luc, and for bacon 33 cents, as was the
.custom. His poke was fat with dust.
He had the price of many drinks. Yet
no barkeeper would serve him. Whis
ky. the hottest, swiftest, eompletest
gratifier of civilization, was not for
him. And he resented this invidious
distinction, as he had resented it for
years, deeply. And he was especially
thirsty and resentful this night, while
the white men he had so sedulously
emulated he hated more bitterly than
ever before.
The Virginia reel in the dance room
wound to a wild close. "All couples
promenade to the bar!" was the call
er's last cry as the music stopped. And
the couples were so promenading
through the wide doorway into the
main room—the men in furs and moc
casins, the women In soft, fluffy
dresses, silk stockings and dancing
slippers—when the double storm doors
were thrust open, and Smoke Bellew
staggered wearily in.
Eyes centered on him, and silence
began to fall. He tried to speak, pull
ed off his mittens, which fell dangling
from their cords, and clawed at the
frozen moisture of his breath which
had formed in fifty miles of running.
Only the man fit the ernps table,
without turning his head, continued to
roll the dice and to cry: "Oh, you Joe!
Come on. you Joe!" The gamekeep
er's gaze, fixed on Smoke, caught the
player's attention, and be. too. with
suspended dice, turned and looked.
"What's up. Smoke?" Matson, the
owner of the Annie Mine, demanded.
With a last effort Smoke clawed his
mouth free. "I got some dogs out
there—dead beat," he said huskily.
"Somebody go and take care of them,
and I'll teil you what's the matter."
In a dozen brief sentences he outlin
ed the situation. The craps player, his
money still lying on the table and his
slippery Joe Cotton still uncaptured,
had come over to Smoke and was now
the first to speak.
"We gotta do something. That's
straight. But what? You've had time
to. think. What's yonr plan? Spit it
out!"
"Sure," Smoke assented. "We've get
to hustle light sleds on the jump. Say
100 pounds of grub on each sled. The
driver's outfit and dog grub will fetch
it up fifty more. But they can make
time. Say we start five of these sleds
pronto—best running teams, best mush
ers and trail eaters. On the soft trail
the sleds can take the lead turn about
They've got to start at ouce. At the
best by the time they can get "there
ail those Indians won't have had a
scrap to eat for three days.
"And then as soon as we've got those
sleds off we'll have to follow up with
heavy sleds. Figure it out yourself.
Two pounds a day is the very least we
can decently keep those Indians travel
ing on. That's 400 pound's a day, and,
with the old people and the children,
five days is the quickest time we can
bring them into Mucluc. Now, what
are yon going to do?"
"Take up a collection to buy all the
grub," said the craps player. "Fetch
a washbasin, somebody. It won't take
a minute. An' here's a starter."
He pulled a heavy gold sack from
his pocket, untied the mouth and pour
ed a stream of coarse dust and nug
gets into the basin. A man beside him
caught his hand up with a jerk and an
oath, elevating the mouth of the sack
so as to stop the run of the dust To a
casual eye six or eight ounces had al
ready run into the basin.
"Don't he a hawg!" cried the second
man. "You ain't the only one with a
poke. Gimme a chance at it"
Men crowded and jostled for the op
portunity to contribute, and when they
were satisfied Smoke hefted the heavy
basin with both hands and grinned.
"It will keep the whole tribe in grub
for the rest of the winter," he said.
"Now for the dogs. Five light teams
that have some run in them."
A dozen teams were volunteered, and
the camp, as a committee of the whole,
bickered and debated, accepted and re
jected.
As fast as a team was selected its
owner, with half a dozen aids, depart
ed to harness up and get ready.
One team was rejected because it had
come in tired that afternoon. One
owner contributed his team, but apolo
getically exposed a bandaged ankle that
prevented him from driving it. This
team Smoke took, overriding the objec
tion of the crowd that he was played
out.
Long Bill Haskell pointed out that,
while Fat Olsen's team was a cracker
jack, Fat Olsen himself was an ele
phant. Fat Olsen's 240 pounds of heart
iness was indignant. Tears of anger
came into his eyes, and his Teutonic
explosions could not be stopped until
he was given a place in the heavy di
-,
i-ision, the craps piayeUjumping at the'. *
being harnessed and loaded, but only
four drivers had satisfied the commit
tee of the whole.
"There's Cultus George," some one
cried. "He's a trail enter, nnd he's
fresh and rested."
All eyes turned upon the Indian, but
his face was expressionless, and he
said nothing.
"You'll take a team?" Smoke said to
him.
Still the big Indian made no answer.
As with an electric thrill it ran through
all of them that something untoward
was impending. A restless shifting of
the group took place, forming a circle
in which Smoke and Cultus George
faced each other. And Smoke realized
that by common consent he had been
made the representative of his fellows
in what was taking place.
Also he was angered. It was beyond
him that any human creature, a wit
fiess to the scramble of volunteers,
•should hang back. For another thing,
in what followed Smoke did not have
Cultus George's point of view—did not
dream that the Indian held back for
any reason save the selfish, mercenary
one.
"Of course you will take a team,"
Smoke said.
"How much?" Cultus George asked.
A snarl, spontaneous and general,
grated in the throats and twisted the
mouths of the miners.
"Wait a bit. boys," Smoke cried.
"Maybe he doesn't understand. Look
here, George. Don't you see, nobody is
charging anything. They're giving ev
erything to save 200 Indians from
starving to death." He paused to let
it sink home.
"How much?" said Cultus George.
"Wait you fellows! Now, listen,
George. We don't want you to make
any mistake. These starving people
are your kind of people. They're an
other tribe, but they're Indians just
the same. Now, you've seen what the
white men are doing-coughing up
their dust, giving their dogs and sleds,
falling over one another to bit the
trail. Only the best men can go with
the first sleds. Look at Fat Olsen,
there. He was ready to fight because
they wouldn't let him go. You ought
to be mighty proud because all men
think you a No. 1 masher. It isn't a
case of how much, but how quick."
"How much?" said Cultus George.
"Kill him!" "Bust his head!" "Tar
and feathers!" were several of the
cries in the wild medley that went up.
The spirit ef philanthropy and good
fellowship changed to brute savagery
pu the instant.
in the storm center Cultus George
stood imperturbable, while Smoke
thrust back the fiercest nnd shonted:
"Wait! Who's running this?" The
clamor died away. "Fetch a rope," be
added quietly.
Cultus George shrugged his sboul
ders. He knew this white man breed.
He had toiled on trail with it and eat
en its flour and bacon and beans too
long not to know it It was a law
abiding breed, ne knew that thor
oughly. It always punished the man
who broke the law. But he had bro
ken no law. He knew its law. He had
in

lived up to It He bad neither mur

There was nothing in the white
man's law against charging a price
and driving a bargain. They all charg
ed a price and drove bargains. He v.iia
doing nothing more than that, and it
was the thing they had taught him.
Besides, if he wasn't good enough to
drink with them, then he was not good
enough to be charitable with them nor
to join them in any of their foolish di
versions.
Neither Smoke nor any man there
glimpsed what lay in Cultus George's
brain, behind his attitude and prompt
ing his attitude. Though they did not
know it, they were as beclouded as he
in the matter of mutual understanding.
To them he was a selfish brute; to him
they were selfish brutes.
When the rope was brought Long
Bill Haskell, Fat Olsen and the craps
player, with much awkwardness and
angry haste, got the slipnoose around
the Indian's neck and rove the repe

they not buy and sell and make all
bargains with bluff? Yes; he had seen
a white man do Business with a look
on his face of four aces and in his
hand a busted straight.
"Wait," Smoke commanded. "Tie hig
hands. We don't want him climbing."
More bluff, Cultus George decided,
and passively permitted his hands to
be tied behind his back.
"Now it's your last chance. George,"
said Smoke. "Will you take out the
team?"
"How much?" said Cultus George.
Astounded at himself that ho should
be able to do such a thing and at the
same time nugered by the colossal self
ishness of the Indian, Smoke gave the
signal. Nor was Cultus George any
less astounded when he felt tbq, noose
tighten with a jerk and swing him off
the floor. His stolidity broke on the
instant. On his face, in quick succes
sion, appeared surprise, dismay and
pain.
Smoke watched anxiously. Having
never been hanged himself, he fuit a
tyro at the business. The body strug
gled convulsively, the tied hands strove
to buret their bonds, and from the
throat came unpleasant noises of
strangulation. Smoke held up his
hands.
"Slack away!" he ordered.
Grumbling at the shortness of the
punishment, the men on the rope low
ered Cultus George to the floor. Ilia
eyes were bulging, and he was tottery
on his feet, swaying from side to side
and still making a fight with his hands.
Smoke divined what was the matter,
thrust violent fingers between tile rope
and the neck and brought the noose
slack with a Jerk. With a great heave
of the chest Cultus George got his first
breath.
"Will you take that team out?"
Smoke demanded.
Cultus George did not answer. He
was too busy breathing.
"Oh, we white men are bogs." Smoke
filled in the interval, resentful himself
at the part he was compelled to play.
"We'd sell our souls for gold, and all
that. But once in awhile we forget
about it and turn loose and do some
thing without a thought of how much
there is in it And when we do that,
Cultus George, watch out. What wo
want to know is. are you going to take
out that team?"
Cultus George debated with himself.
He was no coward. Perhaps this was
the extent of their bluff, and if he gave
in now he was a fool. And while he
debated Smoke suffered from secret
worry lest this stubborn aborigine
would persist in being hanged.
"How much?" said Cultus George.
Smoke started to raise his hand for
the signal.
"Me go," Cultus George said very
quickly before the rope could tighten.
"An* when that rescue expedition
found me." Shorty told it in the Annie
Mine, "that ornery Cultus George was
