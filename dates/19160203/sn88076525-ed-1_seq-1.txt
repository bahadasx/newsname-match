NORTH DAKOTA
WILL OBSERVE
"BABY WEEK"
J. TAYLOR SENDS
TICE URGING THAT
JOIN MOVEMENT.
It is surely very proper for us to
direct the attention of our people to
this subject. There is nothing of
greater importance to bur state than
the children.
"Their welfare means the welfare of
the state. Wehave had our week for
studying the resources of our state
and devising ways and means of in
creasing the wealth of North Dakota.
The natural resources, live stock, man
ufacturing and commerce have had
our attention. It would seem that
our people should very properly set
aside one week for the children and
especially for the babies.
Endorses Movement.
"I endorse the movement and ask
that you co-operate with the officers
of the Federation of Women's clubs
and the committee of the state Edu
cation association (Minnie Neilson,
Valley City, and M. Beatrice John
stone, Grand Forks) in making the
-week of March 4-11 one devoted to the
^welfare of very young children."

While January was not a record
breaker, it was a real winter month,
and at times the thermometer was be
low 40 degrees. With the exceptions
of 1907 and 1912 it was the coldest
month on an average that we have had
since the local weather bureau was es
tablished. Doting the month 9% .in
dies of snow fell, and while there was
no real blizzards there were .many
stormy days.

ED TO THE GROUND.
Langdon, N. D., Jan. 31.—Fire dur
ing a bad storm burned the large barn
of Frank Hoffarthto the ground. The
cause of the fire is not definitely

great danger and consequent danger
that the horses and cattle were saved.
The barn was a fine structure with a
high stone wall rising above the foun

settlement. It has not been learned
to what extent, if any, the loss
covered by insurance.

INDEPENDENCE FOR
PHILIPPINE ISLE1'
Washington, D. C., February 3.—
Yesterday afternon the senate voted
to give the Phillippine Islands their
independence within fotir years. The
vote was a tie and the vice-president
cast the deciding ballot in favor of
the measure, carrying by a vote of 41
to 42.
TO ELECTRIFY
ITS SYSTEM
G. N. WILL CHANGE ITS POWER
FROM SPOKANE TO SEATLE.
ROAD MAY USE ELECTRICITY ON
ALL LINES IN WASHINGTON.
TheGreat Northern railroad propos.
es to electrify its system between Spo
kane and Seattle, a distance of ap
proximately 340 miles. This project
will, it is said, be on the road's list
of improvements to be proceded with
next year.
It is believed in Western railroad
circles that the Great Northern will
eventually use electric power on all its
lines in the state of Washington. En
gineers of the company have been for
some time going over the plans and
preparing estimates of the cost of the
work.
In view of the Milwaukee road's en
terprise in electrifying 440 miles of
line across Montana the possibility of
the Great Northern substituting elec
tricity for steam across Washington
has aroused deep interest. It is said
that the Great Northern's project
across the state of Washington would
be easier of accomplishment than the
Milwaukee's electrical extension.
MUST!"
The Great Northern would have to
electrify over only one mountain
"range, the Cascades, where the Mil
waukee has crossed three, the Belt,
Bitter Root and Rockies. It will cost
the Milwaukee road a total of about
$8,000,000 for electrifying 440 miles of
line and it is competently estimated
that it would cost the Great Northern
around 6,000,000 to electrify 340 miles
from Spokane to Seattle.
When the 440 miles across Montana
are completely equipped by the Mil
waukee, power would be drawn from
eight different stations, insuriug lon
tinuity of service and guarding ag
ainst a possible breakdown at any of
the stations. For this reason it is
suggested that if the Great Northern
should electrify across Washington, It
may buy power at Seattle and Spo
kane, as well as develop its ow.. power
at Lake Chelan.
IS SENTENCED
TO TWO YEARS
Last week Ignatz Youngwortli, who
has led a varied life in this city was
arrested on a charge of assault with a
dangerous wepon on the person of Mr,
DtYftney, a local mail clerk. He was
taken before Judge Buttz, and plead
guilty to the charge andwas Sentenced
to spend the next two years in the
penitentiary at Bismarck. Young
worth at one time was a most notor
ious bootlegger of this city, and later
was acting in the role of a spotter or
detective. He has been considered a
most worthless diameter and very few
will regret seing him go to the pen.

commonly called infectious pneumon
ia, in cattle being shipped from South

Veterinarian Dr. W. F. Crewe.- Out
breaks have been reported at Mer.o
ken, Wilton, Tagus and Arnegard.
The disease, which is a blood infec

Dr. Crewe is sending specimens of
the internal organs of infected ani
mals to the federal bureau of animal
industry at Washington for examina
tion. So far no cui*e for the disease
has been discovered and veterinarians
are at a loss as to how to treat "t. as
a general rule the animals infected
are seggregated and allowed to die.

BEAVERS MOVE
SHOCKS FOR A DAM
Mandan, N. D., Feb. 1.—"Go down
and chase those hogs out of Frank
Dettman's oat field," was the order
of G. D. Gunder, to his children.
The children obeyed, and in a
STATE PRESS
r?\v
minutes came running back
"They're not hogs, they're beav
ers!" they exclaimed,
I Then Frank Dettman and G. D.
Gunder, who are farmers near Jud
fSon, wont to Investigate.
They discovered that heave*'' jia(j
moved eight oat shock* *)f
ten buadks
each to the Sifeet Briar creek and
there used them in building a dam.
The beavers had moved the shocks
more than 700 feet to the bank of the
creek, there pushed them into the
stream and swam with them 100 feat
down stream to the beaver dam,
where, the oats were woven into the
obstruction.
Mr. Dettman previously had ap
pealed to game wardens for relief
from the beaver damage, but asserts
that he now will pretect the animals.
There are dozens of beavers in the
Sweet Briar creek along his farm,
and with closed season in North Dak
ota, until 1920, he expfects to develop
a full fledged beaver farm, and.then
make a "clean-up" on hides after
that date.
Protected for the past severnf years'
the beavers are becoming tame and
are increasing in great numbers. Mr
Dettman asserts that on his farm
there have been more than 200 trees
cut down, and other farmers report
big damage.
GUNDER OLSON FOR

The meeting of the North Dakota
rress Association was held in Grand
Forks Friday and Saturday last c.nd
proved to be a very pleasant and pro
fitable meeting. While there was not
as large a meeting as had been hoped
for, owing to the stormy weatl.er and
many trains being blocked, over fifty
members were present and many mat
ters of importance were taken up.
All clay Friday there was a business
meeting and at six oclock a splendid
banquet was given by the Giand
Forks Commercial Club, after which
there was a social dance, which wr.s
thoroughly enjoyed by those pesent.
Saturday there was another busi
ness, session, and before the close el
ection of officers took place and the
place for holding the summer meeting
was decided upon, as well as for the
next winter meeting. The summer
meeting will be held at Lake Mete
gosche, near Bottineau, and the Bot
tineau Commercial Club will have
charge of the affair. The winter meet
ing will be held at Bismarck. Among
the many important matters taken up
by the Association, and we believe the
most important matter, was .the or
ganization of the Publishers Mutual
Fire Insurance Company. The plan
was laid before the gathering by E.
M. Crary, and every member present
became very enthusiastic over the
project. Resolutions were passed fa
voring the organization of such a com
pany and a committee of which E. IL
Cr^ry is chairman, wr.s appointed to
push the proposition along.
The election of officers preceded the
selection of meeting places. Robert
Hughes, of Wahpeton, was chosen
president. The other offcers are:
First vice president, M. I. rkner,
Langdon second vice president, Geo.
A. Montieth, Finley third vi pres
dent, J. H. McGarry, Alexander sec
retary, D. R. Carlson, Towner treas
urer, J. H. Howard, McHenry ex
ecutive committee, E. F. Peterson,
Dickinson W. B. McLaughlin, Ken
mare H. P. Knappen, Bismarck.
The convention, which closed late
Saturday afternoon, was undoubtedly
one of the nu. successful in the his
tory of the association. Advertising
was the general theme of the conven
tion and many helpful discussions
brought out important ideas on all
phases of the question.
Some time ago a detective by the
name of Normal Luce was tried at
Minnewaukan, the charge being kid
napping a child which belonged to the
Michaels family. This family has been
in the lime-light for some time past
and among other things a divorce was
granted and the child was in the cus
tody of the father, when this detec
tive and the child's mother came from
Duluth and succeeded in g-ining po
session of the child and the outcome
was the arrest and conviction of young
Luce, the detective. He now seeks a
new trial and the argiunents were
heard before Judge Bnttz the latter
part of the week. Luce appears to be
a bright young man and his predica
ment is more the result of his ignor
ance of the law, than of any criminal
intent. Theverdkt of the jury in
convicting hin\ was a surprise to all
who heard the ease.
CLOOIOIE
Next Monday the Commercial Club
will hold a general meeting and smok
er. There will be short talks by
Rev. Oehler, Attorney R. V. Smythe,
Howard Maher, Prof, ^eal and also
Jerome Freeman, who will talk on
"What the traveling men think tf
Devils Lake." All traveling men, es
pecially, are invited .to attend this
meeting.
