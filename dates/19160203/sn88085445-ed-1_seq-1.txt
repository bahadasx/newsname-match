IN BIG DEBATE
One of the most important erect I
of the school year will take place
tomorrow night when Lynden and
Everett meet in debate at the High
School Auditorium. Tr is is tie
third debate in a series of four and
both teams should be well prepared.
Lar.t year Everett tied for the Dis
trict championship and is making a
close race for the honors this year.
Lynden is, so far, undefeated .his
year, which all points toward an in
to est ing contest.
It 1b always interesting to make a
brief survey of Lynden's success !n
debate for the past few years. Lyn
den has always entered all series
and has never yet forfeited a con
test. During the past four years a
total of eighteen debates have
held, Lynden ga'ning the victory in
fourteen case*.. It is doubtful 'f any
other school in the state has been
as successful for a like period of
years.
Every Lynden citizen should hear
this contest. The team is worthy
of support, and the evening will be
an interesting one.
The following are Night School

Need of Conservation of the Health of
Men of Middle Age
By Dr. E. H. LEWINSKI-CORWIN, New York Academy of Medicine
CAREFUL governmental and private statistical studies have estab
lished beyond doubt that the comparatively higher tendency of
mortality" begins in middle life AND IS ALREADY STRIK
INGLY NOTICEABLE AT THE AGE OF FORTY, AT THE PERI
OD OF GREATEST USEFULNESS AND EFFICIENCY OF THE
AVERAGE PERSON.
The experience of life insurance companies confirms the inferences
which are to be drawn from official mortality reports. Students of this
grave sociological phenomenon estimate that in the hist thirty years the
mortality rate of this country has increased at least 20 per cent among
people above the age of forty and that the increase has not yet reached
a culmination point, as deaths from degenerative maladies are increasing
from year to year.
A MILLION INSTANCES COULD BE CITED TO SHOW THAT A MAN
IS AT HIS BEST BETWEEN THE AGES OF FORTY AND SIXTY-FIVE.
The youngest president of the United States was forty-two when he
was inaugurated, and, with five exceptions, all the rest were between
fifty and sixty-five. The world's greatest writers, musicians and actors
have practically ail done their best work after forty. An ever increas
ing death rate at forty and over is a tremendously serious subject for
mankind to ponder.
Treaties Are Beneficial, but Not Securities
Against Greed
By LOUDON M. TOWNSEND, Columbia University
AMONG the many objects to which a wise and free poople find it nec
k essarv to direct their attention that of providing for their safety
seems to be the first This is no less true today than when Ham
ilton, at the tery beginning of the Union, PLEADED FOR SUCH
PREPAREDNESS AS WOULD NOT INVITE WAR, BUT DIS
COURAGE AND REPEL IT.
What has been our military history? Our navy has been called to
action eight times, or once every 17.3 years. Our victories over England
were due to timely distractions of her forces. In the cases of Spain and
Mexico our strength was superior. It cannot be expected in future that
our enemies will be inferior.
ON THE CONTRARY, THERE 13 REASON TO BELIEVE THAT AMER
ICA'B NEXT WAR WILL BE WITH AN EQUAL OR SUPERIOR ENEMY
AND FOUGHT TO THE FINISH.
The anti-preparationist arguments are fallacious. Treaties are ben
eficial, but they are not security against the warrior's g.-eed. Lack of
preparedness, furthermore, not only weakens an existing treaty, but
cripples the power to make satisfactory ones. The opponent of pre
paredness contend also that we have enough latent force to repel any
invasion. Do they recall that Washington was sacked and burned in
,1814?
LOCAL CLUB WANTS

A petition alone the following
lines v.'ill to pieoented for r-ig
nat •.-.res:
Whereas the 4S*th parallel fom
Bla ; ne and White Rock at the Sea
Coast to Sumas and Huntington
traverses a natural pass of even
grade nearly the entire distance of
twenty-five miles.
Ai d Wf ereas, the development c f
the country on both sides of the line
demands the construction here Of ■
highway.
And Whereas, the County Com
missioners <if Whatcom County in
the State of Washington and the
Municipal Council Of Masqui in Brit
ish Columbia, in Joint meeting,
held to arrange for the building of
this road in such a manner as to
avoid duplicating expense, found as
follows:
Ist. That the road would be of
equal value to both countries.
2nd. That connecting as it would
tbe Pacific Highway passing through
Blame from California to Br-tish
Columbia and the Inter-ProrlnclsJ
Highway passing through Hunting
tno and ChlUiwack, if properly con
structed, it would bo impressed n
the memories of tourtetl of many
countries who tise these highways.
3rd. That it would be an indis
putable evidence that British and
American ideals of government
make Boundary lines evidences of
good will and service, and therefore
a most striking means of commem
orating the Century of Peace.
Whereas, it Is beyond the means
of Whatcom County end the Canad
ian Municipalities adjacent to do
tl is work in a manner fitting the
pi eat circumstance which it would
commemorate.
Therefore, be it resolved, that We. j
the undersigned petition the Gov-
ernment of the United States to ne
gotiate with the Canadian authori
ties for the joint building and main
taining of this road and the placing
of tablets on the International
Boundary Posts, thereon, setting
out that the work was done tn com
memoration of One Hundred YearE

FRIENDSHIPS.
May tbe law of Sallust always
remain engraved on tbe beart of
your king. ".Not wltb tbe belp
of nrmies nor treasures do king
doms continue to flourish, but
with the help of friends, and
these cannot tie gained by force
nor bought with gold; Ibey are
won by acts of kiuduess and by
faithfulness." And, moreover,
"It Is necessary always to live
In unity with one's own; by con
cord the smallest things become
grent whilst by discord the
greatest are reduced to nought."
Let him remember the example
of M. Agrippa, who thought
much of this precept which alone
may make of your royal master
a good brother, a good comrade,
a good friend, a good king. Next
to God let nothing be dearer to
him than friendships. Let blm
always implicitly trust the man
he once found worthy of bis
friendship and, according to tbe
advice of Seneca, let him prove
his friends in all things, but take
care first to prove himself also.
• • • Slow in contracting
friendships, let him be even
more slow in breaking them
asunder and. If possible never
let him do so.—Petrarch,
