Naw Honors For Navy Accorded by
Officials and Public
Berlin, via London, Feb. 8.—News of
the arrival of the Appam at Norfolk
arid of the daring raids of a German
cruiser ln the main lane of sea traffic
between Southt Africa and Europe has
aroused a new outburst of enthusiasm
for the navy. The cruiser Moewe—in
English the Seagull—was enrolled Im
mediately on the'honor list with the
Emden, Prlnz EHtel Frledrich and
Karlsruhe. There is no little mastery
here regarding the Identity of the
Moewe admiralty officials not bolng
surprised at the news, but for obvious
reasons decline to give apy Informa
tion.
A vessel named Moewe is given ln
the German navy list as a surveying
ship. She was formerly engaged ln
survey work at the east Afrioan sta
tion. It seems improbale that this
little steamer of 650 tons,-with a speed
of only nine knots, could accomplish
the exploits in question.
It may have been that some larger
