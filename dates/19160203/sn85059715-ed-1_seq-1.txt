rav AtaociAiio rait*
LONDON, Feb. 0.?The London
newspapers this morning express the
conviction that the Germans are
planning a new offensive on a large
scale against the left wing o( the Allies.
It Is expected that they will attempt
to blast a way to Calais and
. Dunkirk by the use of strong bodies
of infantry, supported by enormous
.masses of artillery.
The following British official statement
has been Issued regarding the
operations on the western front:
"One of our patrols last night, after
shooting hostile sentries threw
hand grenades into hostile trenches
established at the northern end of
Frlae.
"At about 11:30 this morning the
men attempted a surprisp attack
against our irenenes near ipres on
the Pilkelm road. The attack waR not
preceded by any artlllpry bombardment
and was easily repulsed by our
lire."
The testimony of a resident of a
sea coast village in Norfolk In Monday's
Zeppelin raid Is given as follows
in the Manchester Guardian:
"About 5 o'clock In the evening I
heard a noise ill the sky above my
cottage and saw a Zeppelin coming
down rather slowly at a steep angle.
It then righted itself and cruised
about as if taking its bearings. It,
was of a grayish brown color. All
the'people of the village came out
to see the airship, which after a cir-,
cuiar movement along the coast,
dropped bombs near some farm village
In a field and then made off. It
was oyer our neighborhood altogether
for about three-quartera of an
' hour and seemed unable to find Its
course. A witness who saw a Zeppelin
over London in the last raid,
says that the present one seemed to
be twice as large."
ARRESTED

Known Cattle Man, on a
Bad Check Charge.
H. H. Broadwater, well known in

Pacific Northwest again today faced 1
the task of battling with an unpre- :

rail communication, disorgan- !

thousands of dollars damage to build- j

withstand the weight of more , than j

In Seattle and other cities street !

Stirring Sermon Dealing with n
Obedience to Laws of Home p
and Teaching Children. ?
TALK IS A PRACTICAL ONEjti
Interest Increases from Day to ?
Day in Great Revival and i
Many Come Forward. {j
One of the most practical as welli'1
as intensely interring sermons imuginable
was delivered last night in the ,,
First Methodist Episcopal church by p
Dr. Morrison. The real text was
taken from Romans. vi, 23, "The
Wages of Sin is Death." However, j
the great evangelist. Dr. Morrison, I
gave it a commonplace and every day .
ipplication for the body of his sermon,
closing with.tho religious phase
ivhlch he had by certain and sure decrees
worked up to. The chief;
[heme was 'obedience," and the j,
home was taken as the basis upon .
which to build the mighty argument
which followed. r
Dr. .Morrison gave some strikingly.
apt Illustrations of the manner in
which many persons permit their,
children to fall Into bad and dangerdus
habits through neglect of proper
training. Particularly is this true ''
in the matter of instant obedience.
[In devedoped the thought that too !
many young people are philosophers
tnd premature reasoners, demanding
to know "why" Instead of simply "
doing thalr parents' bidding. It was
further shown that multitude of parents
are sorely at fault in permitting 11
their children to question the right to ?
control. !
Dr. Morrison certainly displayed]0
wonderful tact in handling this sub-i p
icct, knowing full well that there aro s
paVents who are over sensitive and
easily offended, while there are many
others perhaps who leel a conscious p
sense of guilt or at least a knowledge ?
that they aro fu a measure practicing,?
Lite very tiling against which the I J]
evangelist was thundering his phllip-l^
pics. But a wave of contagious hu- .
mor running down and engulfing ev-i
cry frown brought the audience
quickly lo the closest sympathy and I
had It not been for the fact that the;
lacredness of the situation command
dod otherwise, it was evident repeated
applause would have followed. In I:
short. It was the ablest sermon of its;
kind that has been beard in this sec-:
Lion in many months.
In working up the connection between
obedience to the earthly parents
and obedience to God, Dr. Mor- a
rison said "by far the greatest means c
of grace Is the hickory limb and the ti
mourner's bench." Front that to
thought he tiulckly showed the great j c
need o:' obediencJi to the ever present I o
laws cf Jehovah and the bowing to
divine will, the cennon was so unique :e
and wonderful in 113 plan and execu-; |,
lion that those who heard it marveled
as they listened, asking seemingly, |,
"How can one come, into such close y
harmoa>' with the Creator as to talk of
His mysteries and wonders with n
such perfect knowledge?" It was a
marvelous indeed. 1
The meeting Is one of great results, ti
numbers coming forward nightly and c
confessing Christ as a personal Saviour.
The penitents have been a v
multitude and the conversions many, c

For All
*Impression
is That Most Aspi-i*
rants Will Wait until the c
Eleventh Hour. f
With only two days left in which to j
formally enter the race for city offices, j
there was today a dearth of candidates
for all offices, with the exception of,}'
councilman from the First ward, for 11
which post three njcn, two Republicans, a
and one Democrat, have declared (
themselves. John Flaherty, the Demo- r
cratlc candidate from that ward, Is the
only member of his party to yet enter f
the race for any city office. I,
According to the provisions of the i
ordinance regulating the city primary,1 (
recently passed by the city' council, t
all aspirants for . nomination for the
city offices must notify the city clerk jj
of their Intentions before 5 o'clocK11
Saturday afternoon, February 5. I c
Tho general Impression prevails e
that moat of the would-be eandldatcs t
are planning to wait until 'tho last 'c
minute to announce themselves, mean- n
time looking the situation over, endeavoring
to learn Just how strong'
they are.
Although he has not as yet made!
announcement of his candidacy, rumor | i
persists that J. T. Swagcr, city coun-'c
oilman from the Third ward,' will en-; i
tcr the race for the Republican noml- {s
nation for mayor. Mr.. Swoger'a!"
friends, It Is said, have been looking <
the situation over for sometime. Mayor! I
G. H. Gordon lias already announced |'
his candidacy for reelection. There |
may be a dark |iorse or two on the
Republican side for mayor. . j
Among the Democrats, n strong sen- j
tlmcnt In favor of Edgar F. Hood for /
the Democratic nomination for mayor,
is said to be crystallzlng. Mr. Hood, i
however, has not yet announced hlmneIf,
and Is said to be in a receptive
mood.
Chief of Police Harry I.. Brooks remains
the only avowed candidate fori?
chief of police. There Is much spec- ?
ulation as to whether he will have op- ''
position at the primaries. In Demo-,
cratlc circles, it is said that Kenneth ; J,
Sapplngton. who was the Democratic1.
candidate for chief of police in 1915,jj,
would enter the race for the.nomina-j r
tion at the hands of his party. c
For superintendent of streets only L

himself. He is 13d ward J. Doyle,
stroct supcrlnteodent for many years, j
who seeks the Republican nomination i
for this office. c
W. Clarence Xoon has entered the e
race for the Republican nomination for a
city aRsessor. r
Although a number of persons have s
been mentioned as prospective candl- 1

man has so tar formally entered the o
race, He is i^tvard W. Laubenatein.1 v
