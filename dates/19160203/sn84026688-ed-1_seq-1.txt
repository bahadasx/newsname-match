-a Crystal Gray’s Legacy faju
Notebook of an Old Detective
by Charles Edmonds Walk
And With Names and Places Hidden Published is a Proof That
Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction
It is not invariably that a detective
is called upon to match his wits
against criminal cunning. Many of
life’s most intricate and perplexing
complications flow out of acts that are
Innocent enough in themselves, or even
Inspired by the most praiseworthy of
motives; but, of course, whose distant
results could not possibly have been
imagined, much less anticipated
Cases like these form pleasant breaks
In the depressing, monotonous proces
sion of such as owe their orign to
criminal activity or illegitimate prac
tices.
At the same time the domestic prob
lems are often the most difficult to
cope with; all of the operatives re
sources of intelligence, skill and ex
perience are sometimes baffled; but
many of them offer phases of interest
that are quite as compelling as when
he is trying to solve, say, an unusual
murder. All sorts of eccentrics are
met with: queer trails of character
play their part; sometimes the partici
pants are plunged into tragedy, or else
tragedy is averted only in the nick of
time. The archives of the Sutherland
Detective agency conceal the records
of many cases of this description.
One of these unusual cases was
brought to the attention of Felix Haz
ard in a rather remarkable way.
Nearby the Sutherland offices was a
shabby little shop, whose proprietor
dealt in all sorts of curious odds and
ends, though his tastes ran chiefly to
old books. The shop, in truth, reflect
ed the proprietor's quaint character,
and most of his curios were so ex
tremely bizarre that they attracted
purchasers by their striking and fan
tastic oddity. Thus the old man,
whose name was Philo Godall, pros
pered.
One morning when Hazard was in
the shop Godall spread upon the dirty
showcase a bookseller’s trade journal
and pointed to a certain advertise
ment.
"Here is something peculiar,” said
he. "I have seen that advertisement,
or one just like it, in four or five dif
ferent papers during the past week.”
Hazard looked where the old man's
Anger was pointing, and read;
”1 WILL PAY SI,OOO FOR TWO CER
TAIN HOOKS.
“The title pages of the two books show
them to be:
”1, 'Prlncipall Navigations, Voiages
and Discoveries of the English Nation,’
by Richard Hakluyt, London, 1582.
”2. ’A Particular Discourse Concern
ing Western Discoveries,’ by Richard
Hakluyt, London, 1584,
"These two volumes are not genuine,
but spurious, first editions, and are
intrinsically worth only the paper upon
which they are printed.
"As heirlooms, however, they have
a value to the undersigned, who will
pay SI,OOO (SSOO for each volume) up
on delivery to him in an unmutilated
or otherwise undamaged condition
"When the library of the late H.
Sydenor Gray was disposed of in June,
1913, the two books specified were in
cluded In the catalogue by mistake. 1
am extremely anxious to recover them.
"Address: Edward S. Gray, R. F. D.
14, Unamlnee, 111.”
Hazard looked at the old dealer.
"Well,” said he, “what’s so peculiar
about that?”
Before replying. Godall stooped and
fished something from underneath the
counter. He laid two dingy, scratched
and battered leather-bound volumes
upon the showcase.
"There,” he announced, "are the
very books the young man is so eager
to get.”
The detective examined them curi
ously, and as the conversation pro
ceeded he ran through the pages with
deft fingers, now and then pausing to
examine one or another with more par
ticularity.
"Why young?” he asked. "Do you
know him?”
“I've seen him. It was I whp bought
most of old Sydenor Gray’s library—
these two among the rest of the books.
He had very little that was worth a
good deal, and so of course they didn’t
add much to the estate.
"But the funny part about it is that
several weeks ago I sold these very
same books, and after seeing the ad
vertisement for the first time, to save
my soul all I could remember of the
transaction was that I had accepted a
dollar apiece for them; I hadn’t the
faintest recollection of who had bought
them.
"I didn’t worry much about It,
though: 1 thought, ‘lf the purchaser
should chance upon this advertisement
he'll find he's made a good invest
ment,’ and dismissed the matter from
my mind.
"Well, sir, what do you think! Not
more than an hour ago he came blus
tering in hero and slammed them
down on the counter in a tpwprlng
rage—said I’d cheated him, and so on.
Tried to sell ’em, 1 guess, to some
body that knew more about old edi
tions than he did.
“I didn't argue with him; I gave
him back his two dollars and he went
away apparently satisfied.” Godall
chuckled in high good humor.
Hazard cr ngratulated him on his
windfall and thought no more of the

incident until, some hours later, it was
recalled to his mind in a surprising
manner.
A card was brought to his desk by
one of the young men whose duty it
was to Intercept callers the Instant
they stepped from the elevator into
the reception room. The card bore
the name, "Miss Crystal Gray,’ and in
a moment the name’s owner was ush
ered into Hazard’s presence.
He beheld a tall, slender blonde
woman, pretty and smartly gowned,
who carried herself with a quiet, as
sured air. He rose at her entrance
and indicated the chair where all call
ers were invited to sit; one that faced,
across Hazard’s wide table desk, two
high, uncurtained windows. Thus
were disingenuous persons placed at
a disadvantage, for the glare beat
upon them like a searchlight, while
Hazard, his back to the windows, was
in comparative shadow.
As he returned to his own seat the
girl gravely surveyed him
"This is a novel experience for me.”
she began, "and I hope 1 haven’t been
driven to calling on you because ot my
stupidity: but, really, I am at my wits’
end."
Hazard smilingly encouraged her.
"Suppose you tell me what is worry
ing you. Sometimes it is possible to
clear away another's troubles by a
word.”
The fair visitor appeared thoughtful
for a moment, then she asked:
“Is the name of H. Sydenor Gray
familiar to you?”
"I have heard the name," was his
reply, "but it is not familiar to me."
"Well," the girl pursued, "he was my
uncle. He was an active man of af
fairs until about eight years ago, when,
his health failing with advancing
years, he returned to the old family
home at Unaminee. where he remained
til! his death last May.
“Mr. Gray never married, but dur
ing his life he acquired a considerable
fortune—-or, at least, he was so reputed
and he led others to believe that he
had; but if he left any fortune nobody
has been able to find it.
"Before we go any further 1 want to
make my position clear. When Mr.
Gray returned to Unaminee I was thir
teen years old, living with my wid
owed mother in the old home place.
We were very poor and unable to
maintain the property in anything like
the style it was intended for, and it
had run down shamefully. Indeed,
mother made no attempt to keep it up.
It was much too grand and imposing
to attract a tenant in a small town like
Unaminee, and we were obliged to
cling to two or three of the smaller
rooms because we had now here else to
go.
"Well, all this was changed when Mr.
Gray appeared. A landscape gardener
and a host of assistants were hired
and the extensive grounds cleared and
beautified, and the house was repaired
and refurnished throughout. In short
he spent money lavishly to put every
thing in order, and 1 daresay there it
no country place anywhere more beau
tiful than 'Gray Gabies.'
"Poor mother enjoyed the restored
splendors of her old home little more
than a year, when she died. It was
then uncle informed me that I was to
be his heiress, Intimating that It was
in his power to make me rich. I have
much to be grateful for to my uncle.
He provided the best musical educa
tion available, so that I am now able
to make a fair living. I'm not a grand
opera star, nor ever shall be; but sum
mer chautauquas and lyceum engage
ments during the winter keep me em
ployed.
"During the last three years I have
been much away from home, and some
thing over a year ago a nephew of
Mr. Gray’s, Edward Gray, showed up
at 'Gray Gables.’ Years ago Edward
got Into some sort of trouble that in
volved uncle; but he must have given
promises of reformation and in some
way made amends so that uncle for
gave him.
"Uncle, however, repeatedly assured
me that Edward’s coming in no way
would affect my position: as a matter
of fact, he told me less than a year be
fore he died that he could provide suit
ably for his nephew without diminish
ing my inheritance.
"I am going into this so fully be
cause I want you to see clearly that
from the beginning I was imbued
with the idea that some day I should

establishment like his without ample
means.
"Now, to be entirely frank, uncle in
many respects was —well, queer, ec
centric. Practically nothing was
kndwu of his past life, and he always
avoided talking about it. He used to
rail at banks, a firm belief ol Ms being
that their chief aim was to defraud
their depositors.
“So where was h’s money?
"The sequel showed that his bank
balance was comparatively small.
"The rest I can tell you in a few
words. Four days before ho died he

everything into money and negotiable
securities; there's no use paying heavy

"Well, afler uncle was buried Ed

my contempt of his greed that made

else.
"As 1 say, I make a fair living; but
hero 1 am saddled with a huge man

an army of servants to keep it up.
something that is utterly beyond my
means. At the same time the idea of
parting with ,t is too repugnant to be
thought of. My grandfather built it;
my father was born and lived there till
he died: it is the only tome I ever
knew. And, oh, it is a paradise!
"However. I would have accepted the
situation, bitter as was the disappoint
ment. and been resigned to make the
best of it, had it not been for the con
duct of Edward Gray. On one pretext
and another he lias remained at Gray
Gables’ since uncle’s death. 1 don't
object to that, because under present
conditions I can’t be there much my
self: but whenever I have a day or
two I run down to Unamlnee, and at
such times 1 am being confronted on
every hand by evidences of Edward's
prying Inquisitiveness.
“This unpleasant trait first manifest
ed itself w hen lie revealed a desire for
the cancelled check which my uncle
had given me. Why in the world
should he want that? Purely out. of
sentiment, lie assured me; he wished
to keep it as a memento of his dead
uncle.
"To be perfectly candid, I dislike
Edward; I don't trust him. I believe
him to be sly and tricky; so 1 doubted
his motives. 1 told him that for the
same reason I might want to keep the
check myself, and reminded him that
he had one of his own that would
serve the same purpose. A day or
two later he again asked mo for the
check, tliis time declaring that he
wished to have both of them framed
and hung in the library. When I
again refused to give it to him he be
gan making love to me and finally
proposed marriage,
"But the climax revealed itself
about ten days ago. At that time 1
missed my check from the desk drawer
where 1 kept it. Edward was sup
posed to be In Chicago, so I couldn’t
speak about it to him. Yesterday I
went unexpectedly to 'Gray Gables'
and found the check back in its proper
place.”
“Have you the check with you/”
Hazard inquired.
Miss Gray opened her hand-nag and
produced it; it was precisely like any
other check that has been properly
drawn, Indorsed and presented for
payment. It appeared thus:
"To the Unaminee State Bank of
Unamlnee, Illinois.
June 9, 1913.
"Pay to the order of Crystal Gray
$086.55 (Six Hundred Eighty-six and
55-100 dollars).
"H. SYDENOR GRAY.”
Conspicuous upon the face of the
instrument was the bank's cancella
tion stamp, which show'ed that the
check had been paid June 21, 1913. As
it stood it represented nothing but a
record of the transaction; it was worth
just so much waste-paper, and no
more.
The detective, however, subjected
the slip to a careful examination. On
the back appeared merely the indorse
ment, "Crystal Gray;" but this side of
the paper he scrutinized for several
minutes through a magnifying lens.
By and by ho laid it aside and regard
ed the girl curiously.
“Well,” he said at last, "what do you
think about it?”
“I don’t know what to think —un-
less it is that Edward suspects a hid
den horde and is moving heaven and
earth to find it.”
"That’s obvious enough. But”—
Hazard’s eyes narrowed —“how did
Edward learn that your check—this
slip of paper—bore the secret of the
treasure’s hiding place?”
The expression of bewilderment and
uncomprehension that overspread
Miss Gray's countenance was too real
and convincing to have been assumed
Hazard added:
“If you did not know yourself that
the check bore such a message, how
could he have possibly discovered the
fact?”
"What do you mean?” returned the
girl blankly. "I—l don't understand.”
Smiling, Hazard pressed a button.
"I think I can make everything clear
in a few minutes," lie explained: a
rash declaration which subsequent de
velopments were to contradict so em
phatically that he was goaded to his
best endeavors to justify what was
tantamount to a promise.
He was hurriedly scribbling a note
when a youth appeared at the door.
He paused to direct: "Bring me the
alcohol-lamp," and by the time the
youth had fetched the lamp the note
was finished and scaled In an envelope
addressed to “Philo Goodall.”
“Deliver that and report Immediate
ly," wore his instructions as he handed
the message to the young man.
The door closed behind the messen
ger and Hazard lighted th - wick be
neath a metal plate.
Shortly he extinguished the flame
and spread the cancelled check face
down upon the heated plate. "Como
over here and watch," he invited.
Profoundly curious, Miss Gray came
round his desk and watched across his
shoulder. In a few seconds faint, red
disli lines begun to appear upon the
blank surface, and a litlle exclamation
of surprise burst from her lips as here
and there a letter became clear until
the lines resolved themselves into this
sentence:
Hakluyt's "Principall Navigations”
"Western Discoveries" are the
gateway to your inheritance.
"Sympathetic ink,” Hazard ex
plained. "The inference that the check
bore some sort of message was pretty
manifest and I looked for evidence of
it My lens brought to light numerous
slight abrasions where the pen-point
scratched the glaze.
“And now,” he added, as the mes
senger re-entered and laid a brown
paper parcel and a folded trade jour
nal upon the desk and at the sane
time handed hi;*i a note, “with the key
“Well,” He Said at Last, ‘♦What Do You Think About It?"
in our hands, let s see whether we
can’t unlock the gates. First, though,
look at this,” and he spread the jour
nal open at Edward Gray’s advertise
ment.
Miss Gray read her cousin’s extraor
dinary offer with growing wonder and
astonishment.
"Whatever in the world!” she pres
ently marveled, meeting the detec
tive’s grave regard. ‘How did Edward
know—where did he learn the check’s
secret, when I, the one most interest
ed, had no inkling of such a thing?”
Felix Hazard shook his head. “That’s
immaterial 1 ow. The important fact
is that ho did know about it, and his
efforts to unearth the hiding place
confirm our conclusion that the treas
ure does exist. We should try to find
it first —or, watch your cousin, and in
case he locates it get it away from
him somehow. Ho might be able,
though, to throw the matter into the
courts and exact a division.
“Here is our chance. I have a note
from the present owner of the books
in which he says he has answered the
advertisement and that if the offer is
genuine he expects to deliver them at
once and collect the thousand dollars.
“My suggestion is that I tr” to wrest
the hidden message from the books by
an application of my methods. 1 shall
devote this evening to it. Return here
tomorrow morning and perhaps I’H
have good news for you.”
Miss Gray was still standing close
to Hazard, and In a sudden burst of
enthusiasm she impulsively caught his
hands in both of hers.
“Oh, how splendid!" she cried de
lightedly. ‘.‘And I shall be generous—
Indeed, indeed I shall!”
At the sound of a soft voice In the
doorway both turned and beheld a tall,
lovely girl with a wealth of chestnut
hair and wide gray eyes, which just
now glanced with cool indifference
from one to the other of them.
“Pardon me,” she repeated; "1 didn’t
mean to intrude. Nobody seemed to
hear my knock, I —’’
Hazard interrupted.
"Come In, Helen. This is Miss Gray;
she has brought rather a pretty prob
lem for us to solve.” And to Miss
Gray lie explained: "Miss Bertel is one
of our operatives.”
But Miss Bertel did not seem very
curious respecting Miss Gray and her
problem and the latter, after promis
ing to return the next forenoon, gave
Helen Bertel a final doubtful, Inquir
ing glance, and departed.
"A very pretty girl,” Hazard com
mented.
"Was she?” was Miss Bertel’s indif
ferent response. "I didn't notice. 1
came to learn whether the papers ir
the Minch case—”
Hazard cut in
"l mailed them two hours ago. What
about them?"
"That’s all. The chief told me to
ask.”
She was moving toward the door
again when Hazard stayed her. He in
dicated the two shabby volumes and
began telling her about the enigma
whose elucidation he had undertaken.
By degrees professional zeal excited
the girl's interest and, sinking into
the chair recently vacated by Miss
Gray, she lent an attentive ear to the
recital.
And all that evening, and till the
small hours of morning, the two la
bored side by side over the two vol
umes. Thin, cunning instruments
searched the covers for hidden re
cesses; X-ray photographs were taken;
page by page, line by line, word by
word, the text w as gone over in search
of a cryptographic message; heat and
various acids were applied on the
chance that invisible ink might be
made visible, as had been accom
plished with the check; but ail to no
purpose. Tired, worn and sleepy after
hours of concentration and application.
Hazard impatiently pushed the books
away from him and owned himself
baffled, beaten.
Helen smiled at him slyly.
"Cheer up, Felix,” she encouraged:
"Miss Crystal Gray can come again
another day—and again and yet
again.”
Hut Hazard apparently did not hear
her. His hair was rumpled, and he
stared vacantly at the battered books.
“Anyhow, Felix,” Helen assured
him, with a change to seriousness,
“you have proved at least one thing
conclusively: you haven’t gone the
right way about to read the riddle "
“I wonder!” he said, staring hard at
her. All at once he seemed to be elec
trified. He shot forward in his chair
and looked at the memorandum of the
inscription on the check.
Hakluyt’s "Prlncipall Navigations”
and "Western Discoveries” are the
gateway to your inheritance.
“By heck!” he ejaculated after a mo
ment. “I believe you’re right! Well,
I’ll have some news for Miss
Gray after all. But I’ll make no more
rash assurances till I’m prepared to
substantiate them.” He smiled whim
sically.
“Say, I’d like to see Cousin Edward
when he tries his hand at finding the
hidden directions. Before he’s done
with it, if he doesn’t conclude he’s
bought a gold brick —two of ’em —I’ll
miss my guess a mile. But you may
enjoy the fun. I’ll arrange for you to
accompany Miss Gray to ’Gray Gables’
tor a day or two —”
"Really?” Helen broke in. "When
you might go yourself! Self-denial,
my dear Felix, was ever your cardinal
virtue."
Hazard ignored this dig.
"There’s the off-chance that Edward
holds the missing link, just as he knew
about the message on Miss Gray’s
check, and ho will bear watching.
My new theory promises to present
fresh difficulties, and as soon ns I’ve
had time to turn it over In my mind
I’ll run down to Unaminee and give It
a test. . . ■ Gateway—hmmm!”
Miss Helen Bertel of Chicago had
been Miss Crystal Gray’s guest for
tour days before Hazard showed up
at the little town, though she talked
with him daily over the telephone.
On the second day after her arrival,
Terms SI.OO in Advance
NO. 47.
Edward Gray had had a caller, an old
man, who brought with him a brown
paper parcel, which he did not carry
away again. Since the arrival of the
parcel Helen had seen Edward Gray
only at rare moments, and he was
growing so pale and haggard with
anxiety that she was beginning to feel
pity for him. Manifestly, he was no
more successful at digging out the
books’ secret than she and Felix had
been.
What little she had seen of Edward
Gray, however, confirmed Miss Bertel's
estimation of the young man's charac
ter; and thus a bond of sympathy and
understanding was created between
the two girls. To tell the truth, Helen
was thawing toward the other girl,
who, like 1 erself, was independent and
self-reliant, and undismayed by the
necessity of wresting a living from
tiie world. She sincerely hoped Miss
Crystal would find her inheritance!
On the fourth day Felix Hazard was
shown into the vast room at “Gray
Gables” that had once served as its
library, Hoth Helen and the pretty
mistress of the house greeted him.
His first words were addressed to the
latter.
“Where is your cousin?” he curtly
asked.
"Locked in his room, fighting with
the musty old books. I’m afraid he
will be ill unless his efforts are re
warded pretty soon.”
"He’ll gain nothing,” Hazard averred,
“if he pores over them till doomsday.
Meanwhile, we may get busy ourselves
without fear of interruption from him.
. . . This room was Mr. Sydenor
Gray’s library, I suppose?”
His glance skirted the walls, which
were bare save for a few pictures. The
proportions were large, the shape ir
regular; that is, its lines W'ere broken
by two wide and deep alcoves, an
enormous fireplace and three large
bay-window embrasures. The shelves
with their hundreds of queer and most
ly worthless old books were gone, and
the room and been redecorated and re
furnished.
"Yes,” Miss Gray acknowledged.
“Have you any recollection of where
the two Hakluyts stood on the shelves
—with reference to the wall, I mean?"
“Mercy goodness, no!” was the em
phatic reply. “Every inch of wall
space, almost to the ceiling, was com
pletely hidden by books; nobody, not
even uncle himself, could have told
you precisely where any particular
volume was.”
“Then," Hazard solemnly announced,
“if you want to secure your legacy,
you will have to wreck the walls till
you find it. And at that the labor may
be in vain; my theory may be wrong
again, you know."
Now, at Hazard's last question Helen
liertel's expressive eyes kindled, and
her pretty face grew animated with a
light of comprehension; but she waited
till he and Miss Gray got deep into a
discussion of probable expense, likely
damage to the house, structural dif
ficulties to be met and overcome, the
danger of following another false and
this time a costly trail, w hen she rose
and stole quietly from the room. By
and by she returned and interrupted
the colloquy by dumping a score or
more of large photographs upon the
library table.
Miss Gray and Hazard looked at
them inquiringly, and then at Helen
for an explanation.
“These pictures.” Helen began,
"were taken for the Suburban Home
magazine, so Miss Gray informed me
when I found them and asked about
them. There are two exceptionally
clear views of this very room as it was
before it was dismantled and the books
taken away.”
In a twinkling Hazard ran through
the pile until the views were found
The two did, in truth, prove to be un
usually sharp and clear cut. With his
pocket lens Hazard scanned them in
tently. At last he looked up with an
air of triumph.
"Eureka!” he cried. "Sufficient of
the titles is legible to obviate any
chance of error.”
He bounded to his feet, and, refer
ring to the photograph from time to
time, and comparing it with certain
definite points of the room, he walked
to the west wall and laid his hand
upon a spot on its surface.
"There,” said he, “if it is anywhere,
lies your legacy, Miss Gray. The two
books were, in very truth, the ‘gate
way’ to your fortune, and not the re
pository of the secret of its hiding
place.”
And this time they were not disap
pointed. When Hazard and Helen said
their farewells to Crystal Gray she
was richer by some SBOO,OOO in valu
able bonds and stock certificates, be
sides gold and currency. The reward
of the two operatives was commen
surate with the service rendered, and
the girl proved herself generous as
well as grateful.
To Helen, as Hazard and she rode
back together to the city, he ex
plained:
“Cousin Edward packed his belong
ings when he learned w hat was in the
wind, and quietly stole away. I had a
word with him, however, before he
left.”
“You discovered, I suppose, how he
learned the secret of the check,” said
Helen.
“Yes.” Hazard handed her a small
fragment of paper. In Sydenor
Gray’s handwriting was the direction:
"Preserve this cheque; it holds the
secret of your Inheritance.”
Hazard pursued:
"He meant to pin that to his niece’s
check, but pinned it to Edward’s in
stead. It puzzled him for a time: but
he finally arrived at the correct con
clusion, though like myself he failed
to consider the true meaning of the
word gateway;’ he believed the an
swer was to be found inside the books,
instead of behind them.”
