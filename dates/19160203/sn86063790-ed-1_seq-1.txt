*' Ehrhardt, Feb. 1.?Saturday afternoon,
Mrs. E. P. Copeland entertain-.,
ed a number of ladies in honor of
her grandmother, Mrs. N. J. Stewart.
| . The guests were met at the door by
- Mrs. Copeland, and were seated about
on the porch and in the parlor. Af- ?
$ "ter spending some time in pleasant
^ conversation, a delightful salad
' course, followed with cake and coffee,
was served by Mesdames Copeland,
E. D. Dannelly and H. W.
Ehrhardt. Each guest was given a
souvenir card, bearing the name and
address of the honored guest, and
was requested to send her greetings
j, on a postcard on her coming birth&
day, at which time she will be four
f score years.
' Mrs. Stewart, or "Mudder," as she
is well known, who was the guest of
honor on this enjoyable occasion^ has
many friends in Ehrhardt, and is loved
dearly for her kindness toward
everybody and her sunny disposition.

Mr. John Frank Chassereau had
on exhibition last week one of the
largest turnips that has been seen in
town this season. It was of the red
top variety and was grown on uis
f place south of Ehrhardt by a colored
tenant, Patrick Loadholt. The
/ turnip, weighed five and one-tenth
( pounds, after all dirt had been washed
off. It was perfectly round with
a slight taper at its roots, and measured
six inches in diameter. Some
turnip, eh? Providence has not forgotten
us, a very small cotton crop
last.year, but sugar cane, potatoes
> ^ and turnips have been record breakers.

Lived in Mecklenburg.
Gen. Jose Roderiguez, one of the
most prominent of the Villa generals,
ordered to be executed for being implicated
in the killing of 18 unarmed
Americans in the state of Chihuahua,
was a resident of Mecklenburg county
for two years,> relates a Charlotte
dispatch of last Friday. He came to
this county at the age of 13, to attend
school at Huntersville, in upper
* l-T
iUeCKitJIIUurs.
Rev. Dr. W. W. Orr, now pastor of
East Avenue Presbyterian Tabernacle,
was principal of the Huntersville
school at that time. Young
Roderiguez. came to Huntersville
through the influence of a friend of
Dr. Orr in Mexico, a friend who knew
the boy well. Young Roderiguez impressed
all who knew him as a youth
of fine qualities. He and his mother
were of the class of aristocrats, the
latter owTning 200 square miles of
land near Les Palmas, in eastern
Mexico. Their pride of birth was
strong. Coming to Mecklenburg
with Roderiguez was another boy,
Fritz Stussy, whose father was Swiss,
his mother German, and both Lutherans.
Roderiguez's mother was a
Catholic. Both boys joined the A. R.
P. church while at Huntersville. Between
Dr. Orr and family and young
Roderiguez there existed a strong attachment.
In the years intervening
between his leaving Huntersville and
up to a year ago Roderiguez frequently
remembered Dr. Orr and
family by sending them boxes of
fruit from Mexico.

RADIUM OUTPUT SIX GRAMS. Q
t
Pound of Precious Substance AVould ,
Cost $9,000,000. i
t
Washington, Jan. 31.?More than ^
$9,000,000 a pound would be the ,
nripQ aclrod for radium wprft that _
quantity of tbe valuable metal available
and for sale at one time. Late
in 1915 there was sold in this country
one and one-tenth grams of ra- 1
dium (element) at the rate of $120,000
a gram, according to a report issued
today by the United States geological
survey. The entire output of ]
the United States last year, however, c
was only six grams, or about 1-76 of ]
a pound avoirdupois. The European j
war caused a great slump in the pro- (
duction of radium, as in 1914 there t
were 22.3 grams produced. t
"The United States has the largest i
known radfcim-bearing deposits in c
the world," says the geological sur- f
vey, "but the market for radium is i
mostly in Europe, fc>f, although ]
Americans like to feel that they are
sufficiently progressive to take hold i
of and use to the full new discover- g
ies, inventions and processes, yet the t
European municipalities and hos- <
pitals have been buying amd utilizing |
most of the radium produced. When ]
the war began, therefore, causing \
European money to flow into other *
channels, the demand for radium fell t
off so greatly that there was prac- c
tically no market for racium or ura- }
! nium ores in the early part of 1915, e
and very little market during any g
part of /the year." j
As a result of the collapse of the t
radium market mining for radiumbearing
ores, except for such work as c
was necessary to hold claims, was 3
nearly stopped. Through the efforts i
of the experts of the United States c
bureau of mines a process has been g
developed by which radium has been
produced at a cost of $37,599 a gram.
The principal fields of the radiumbearing
ores are in Colorado and 1
Utah. 1

itocks left on hand to be sold in
ome of the "wet" States. The money

leducting expenses, will go into the

Spartanburg, Jan. 28.?Will J.

jharge of murdering his guard, ^
Robert Stephens, and who escaped 1
4 <
)ursuit by officers of this county-* in
October, 1914, is back in chains in '
;he county jail, having been landed '
;here last night by Sheriff W. J.
White and Capt. R. C. Hall, of the 1
iity police force, who brought him 1
torn New Orleans, where he was ar- {
*ested last week by Pinkerton and
3urns detectives. '
Hughes in jail here today talked to,
ep.orters freely, of his wanderings
>ince leaving Spartanburg, showing
;hat he had been in the West the .
greater part of the time,, but had ]
tone to New Orleans only recently.
n making his way out of Spartan-J
)urg county he said he walked, trav- \
ding only at night, and staying in j 1
he woods during the day. He first \ {
:ame to the railroad at Saluda, N. C., (
le said, forty-eight hours after his '
?cape, having had no food whatever,
ind there caught a freight train to
^.sheville. From that point he went 1
o Memphis.
"Life is just a card game," he
said, "and if you win all right. If 1
ou lose you lose and that is all there c
s to it. You are going to get what's 5
;oming to you in this world and I ^
juess I can take my medipine, what- *
?ver it may be." ^
Lobsters and shad are becoming i
ncreasinglv scarce. The decrease of 1
he former has aroused such uneasi- ?
less that a conference of fishing ex- j
)erts was held recently at Wood's j
lole, Mass.,to devise means for coun-i s
eracting it. The supply of shad is ?
jecoming rapidly depleted because (
he fish do not get adequate protec
ion on their way to the sea from the i
pawning grounds. The most se- t
'ious conditions are in the Chesa- (
)eake Basin, where last year's shad i
ishing yielded the poorest result i

(
Branchville, Jan. 27.?A most ^
laring robbery was pulled off at ,

3 111 vsCL 2\ O, CL O 111 CL 11 IU 11 AUUUt l it cn v j
niles south of here, this afternoon T
ibout 2 o'clock. While Cashier ^
rhomas, of the Smoaks Banking com- (
)any, was at work on his books two ,
nen entered. On looking up, Mr. ,
rhomas found that he was covered
)y a revolver. One man immediate- j
y jumped over the counter and seiz- ]
id him. Mr. Thomas resisted and ..
nanaged to keep this party between ,
limself and the other who held the j
'evolver. In a minute the other man
s said to have jumped over the
counter and struck Mr. Thomas a
severe blow over the right eye. It is 1
ilsb stated that he threw some liquid
drug in the cashier's face, which rendered
him unconscious.
The robbers, it is said, then placed
the cashier in the vault and made
Dff with about $2,000, mostly in currency.
The robbers are said to have been
riding in a Ford runabout, and when
the deed was discovered two hours
later, were traced going in the direction
of Bamberg. One was described
as being about six feet in
height, rather slender, dark complected
and wore a cap. The other
was not as tall, but a little stouter,
dark, and also wore cap. Cashier
rhomas recalled that the smaller of
these men came into the bank a
week ago today, at which time he
asked him to cash a Southern Railway
check for $400. He said to the
str?nger that he could not do it without
identification. The stranger is
said to have asked the cashier if any
others worked in the bank with him.
A reward of $100 has been offered
by the Smoaks Banking company for
the arrest of the robbers. ,
Xo Trace of the Robbers.
Walterboro, Jan. 28.?Careful investigation
by several officers today
in charge of Deputy Sheriff Lucas C.
Padgett has failed to reveal any clue
is to the identity of the two robbers
who in open daylight yesterday succeeded
in getting away with quite a
big sum of money from the Smoaks
Banking company. The two robbers
were not seen to enter the town of
Smoaks during the day at all and they
made their exit through a rear window
and from there to a nearby
swamp, where it is thought they had
in automobile concealed.
Taking advantage of a rainy day,
when very few people would be using
the streets of th.e small town of
Smoaks, the two robbers entered the
bank as the cashier was in the act of
getting one thousand dollars to be
sent here today. After drawing a gun
rm the rashier one of the robbers
grappled with him while the other
struck him with some instrument,
causing unconsciousness. He was
then sprayed with some kind of
drug.
A handkerchief, saturated with the
drug, was the only property left by
the robbers. It was fastened over
the mouth and nose of Mr. Thomas.
He owes his life to the fact that the
robbers failed to turn on the combination
to the vault lock. Had this
been done searchers would in all
probability have thought that Mr.
rhomas had closed up for the day
md left the bank. At any rate the
nnly other person in possession of the
2ombination was the president, Mr.
3moak, who was at the time in Bam-J
ierg. Mr. Thomas is at work again j
:oda\\ little the worse for his nerve-;
'acking experience.
A careful checking of the bank's
Dooks reveals the exact amount of
noney secured to be nineteen hunJred,
seventy-five dollars and eighty- 1
>ix cents. The bank carried burgary
insurance in such an amount as '
;o be protected. ;
Mr. .Thomas is positive in his iden;ification
of one of the robbers as the
nan who asked him to cash a four
lundred dollar check from the ;
Southern Railway about a week ago, '
md it appears that these men were '
somewhere in the community of '
Smoaks, waiting for a rainy day as 1
i cloak for their operations. Tin '
jfficers are still hopeful of securing 1
some results. Xo one has been
?ound who will definitely identify '
;he auto as a runabout or a touring 1
;ar, and very little of a definite (
1
lature can be secured as to the '
-oute taken by the car.

STOCKS FOR BRIDGE PRIZES.
Mrs. E. H. Gary Gives Steel Preferred
to Her Card Guests. j
The New York Times says: Jf||
Mrs. Elbbrt H. Gary entertaned J
with a bridge party at her residence,
856 Fifth avenue, on Saturday, the
guests including many well-known
members of society. The prize at
each table was one share of United
States Steel preferred stock.
Bridge parties are of ordinary occurrence
in society, and handsome t
prizes are given as a rule, but Mrs.
Gary's party will go down in social ii
history as something entirely new,
in this respect at least. The first intimation
that the stock had been
awarded as prizes was heard yesterday
in Wall street, and it was not , v
long before it was being talked about
on the stock exchange.
1 The stock given out in prizes, in - * ^
the aggregate, was worth about '
$702, as it is quoted at $117 a share.
Prizes of much greater value have - h
been awarded at society bridge par- f
ties, but it was the novelty that gave ;
significance to Mrs. Gary's awards.
There were six tables and twenty?
* A 1. _ J _ /> A 1 ' : *?
iour piayers. ai me ena or me < &%
game there was considerable speculation
as to the nature of the prizes, . M
as is always the case at any spirited
game of bridge." If the women win-* :t
ners expected to receive silver bonbon
dishes, powder puff boxes, or.
vanity cases they were no doubt ..
agreeably surprised when they re- ^
ceived the stock, indorsed in blank.
The stock draws dividends of 7 per
* "i
cent. The names of the winners are '
not known. '74
Mr. Gary, who is chairman of the
United States Steel Corporation, confirmed
the report yesterday of the
nature of the prizes at Mrs. Gary's
bridge party, but declined to comment
on it in any way, saying that it
was a private affair.
Mrs. Gary entertains frequently in
the winter season at her home, and
she gives a bridge party once a year.
Editing a Newspaper.
Editing a newspaper is a pleasing
business?if you can stand it. If
subscribers want to bawl out anybody
?the editor's the goat. If the town
is lagging behind and people won't
get out and mak-e things hum?it's
because the town paper is on the
bum. If business is bad?it's because
the editor wants too much
money for his advertising space. If
business is good?advertising hasn't
anything to do with it, but conditions
