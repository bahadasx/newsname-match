Capt. Mossman told Judge Gager

pany he was all right. . But when he
became a sergeant his" manner chang
ed. Gray had good knowledge of mil

critical about small things. An in

reported that a gun crew : of which
Gray had charge was not efficient and
Capt. Mossman notified Gray he would
be removed. This displeased Gray.

one of the speakers at the Civic. Night
of the Olivet Congregational church
tonight. A photograph which the
Men's league of the church had taken
for Mr. Leonard to use in connection
with advertising the meeting, will be
thrown away.
A week ago Mr. Leonard received
an invitationjto talk" on "The Fire De
partment" at the Civic meeting. He
accepted. ' .
This morning Mr. Leonard rescind
sd the acceptance; 'ho said he won't
speak: , .
Rev. Mr. ' Tamblyn was eating
luncheon at the Y. W; C. A. on Broad
Ktreet this afternoon. . He was called
at 1:10 o'clock by a Farmer reporter.
"You're going to have, a meeting to
night, Mr. Tamblyn?" he was asked.
"Yes, the regular Civic meetfhg will
be held tonight," he said.
"I understand that a change has
been made in the program, Mr. Tam

about that.". V
"Don't you know - if any -change
has been made in the program?' .
"There - have been none, to my
knowledge," said Mr. Tamblyn.
, Howard Wheale, prominent mem
ber of the committee- iri charge of the
Civic -meeting, was called at -once.
"Oh, yes," he said, when asked
about a change. ' "John A: Leonard,

SUSPEND DRIVER
OF AMBULANCE
PENDING TRIAL
'- ! i
Burlison Also Suspended As
Special Policeman, on
Leonard's Complaint.
Announcement of ' the suspension
of Aubrey Burlison as driver of the
emergency hospital automobile ambu
lance, and as a special policeman,
pending the - hearing of charges, was
made by the heads of the charities
and the police commissions this after
noon. ... -
Th e charges against Burlison grew
out of a clash that ensued when Presi
dent John A. Leonard of the fire board
unknown to him, questioned Burlison
as to the nature of the business of
the ambulance corps at the Broad
street fire last evening. -
"If I . get off this seat, I'll give you
the best punch in the face you ever re
ceived!" - f ' Is
"Well, you don't see me running
away, do you "
This was only part of the dialogue
between Aubrey Burlison, perched on
his seat on the automobile ambulance
of the department of charities, and
Leonard. .. ,
Leonard,, on his way to a meeting
of his board, ran into the fire. The
ambulance was on the scene. . He
stopped to inquire if a mem'ber of the
department had been injured. ,
Burlison and he didn't get on very
well, when the commissioner ques
tioned the driver.
When . Leonard's identity became
known to Burjlison, the latter made
overtures towards peace. But Leon
ard was distant- He told Burlison
that city officials, as a rule, were sure
of receiving courteous treatment from
the various department employes, but
that private .citizens were entitled to
equally . courteous treatment. For
that reason, he assured Burlison, he
would prefer charges. Leonard re
lated the incident to Police Sergeant
James Ramsay. Burlison is a special
policeman.
Toay President Leonard tiled
charges with both the police and the
charities board, against Burlison as a
special policeman and as an employe
of the charities department, accusing
him of conduct unbecoming a special
policeman and city employe.
"If a fireman acted as he did, I'd
break him almost without a hearing,"
declared Commissioner Leonard. v
Leonard added that he'd not accept
an apology from Burlison, either in
public or private.

"I suppose he was told not to come.
One or two of the boys passed the
word to him and he simply obeyed, I
suppose. Little petty feeling, you
-now.- You better call him up,
though, and talk to him.
"Another funny thing, we asked him
to come to, the hall to tell the admin
istration's part of the thing. We wanted
to know about the fire department
and we asked him to come because
he's a member of the administration."
Mr. Leonard was called at the Al
gonquin club. , ,
"Certainly," he said, "I was invited
to speak on the fire Sepa.rtm.ent and I
accepted in good faith. I didn't find
out until' Jpday that he's the man who
has been attacking the administration
under a nom-de-plume . in a Sunday
newspaper.
"I'm a Republican, I belong to the
administration and. I believe in the
principles and tenets of the Republi
can .a-dministration. I'm not going to
any church to speak, where the pastor
is making attacks on the administra
tion and tinder a mom-de-plume at
that.
"When I found that out, I called up
Mr. Tamblyn and' told him Just what
I told you." .
"Mr. Tamblyn said he didn't know
of any change in the .program," Mr.
Leonard was told.
"He's a liar- even if he is a 'minis-,
ter." .
Later Mr. Wheale said: "The story
has been passed around that some of
the other speakers. Gen. Bishop, Pres
ident John C. Stanley of the police
commissioners, and those fellows,
aren't coming. I've been trying to get
in touch with them and haven't sue
ceeded, but I know Gen. Bishop isn't
coming. ' . .
"We'll manage to get along some

they did attend. And you can make
it strong that maybe we'll have one
or two little surprises at the meet
