ASSEMBLY SPEAKERS
ON OPPOSITE SIOES
Doctor Frank Thilly Takes
Issue With Views of Dean
E. J. McCaustland.
THE NEW EDUCATION
Vocational Training Stressed
by Engineer Philosopher
Defends the Humanities.
Th opening convocation of the sec- us an accepted standard; the new
ond semester, held in the University evolves beauty from within and en
Auditonum at 10 o'clock this morn-,couraBes spontaneity in taste The
. , , . . , , . old is limited and esoteric; the new
ing, partook of the nature of a joint , . ... , , .
debate.
Dr Frank Thill , professor at Cornell
University and at one time professor
of philosophy in the University of
Missouri, took Issue with Dean E. J.
McCaustland on the address w hlch the
latter had just delivered. Dean Mc
Caustland took as his subject "The
New Education," and contrasted the
cul ural, or classical, tpe of educa
tion with the vocational, or scientific,
tvpe, much to the discredit of the
former.
Professor Thilly, in an informal
talk, half m humor and half seriously,
took up the main points of Dean Mc
Caustland's address and presented his
view that the two types of education
tould not be separated.
A Phalanx of Learning.
Visitors and students entering its
auditorium gazed almost in awe
at the solid phalanx of learning and
erudition which fronted them on the
platform Before them stretched row
upon row of professors, many of them
in caii and gown. Much of the chatter
and confusion which usually attend
such an occasion was missing.
The Rev. C. C. Grimes gave the in
vocation. The University string quar
tet played the Finale, Op. 39, Hadyn;
then President Hill introduced the
speaker of the day. Dean McCaust
land said in part:
"There was recently quoted in the
public press the opinion that the Eu
ropean War is In reality a conflict be
tween opposing ideals of efficiency and
of libery. This statement is vicious,
There is no such conflict, for liberty
Is the essence of eiliciency, and ef
ficiency is the very finest flower of
liberty.
"Efficienc is more than a mere
mathematical ratio It involves the
life and spirit of the people. We re
gard the great efficiency which the
Central Powers of Europe have shown
as a culmination of plans long organ
ized, and the failure of the Allies as a
sign of unpreparedness. An anal sis
shows two tjpes of education as the
primar reason for this difference.
The Germanic peoples exemplify the
vocational, or scientific, tpe of edu
cation; the Allies are adherents to
the classical, or cultural, type.
Quotes the Prcs'dcnt.
'President Wilson says: 'The great
voicf of America does not come from
the seats of learning. It comes in a
murmur from the hills and the farms
and the factories and the mills.' I
have no heard these murmurs in the
corridors of Universities.
"The conservative education exalts
and extols college ideas and ideals
without qualification or discrimina
tion. It frankly admits its inability
to catch the interests of virile youth,
and las the blame for this upon the
jouth. It sets up as a standard a
fixed tvpe of attainment, and arrogates
to 'his tvpe the title of higher learn
ing "Vocational education catches capa
ble men wherever they may be found.
Its definite purpose may be express
ed in the word 'usefulness,' and its
aim is to develop man for the best
that is in him, Including women In its
scheme. It furnishes more than an
intellectual training, and is not satis
fied with any training that does not
result in action. It encourages In
dividual initiative.
"The education of a democracy does
not mean that we shall be forced to a
standard or mediocity, it does not
mean equal opportunity to all, and it
does not limit attainment. Vocational
education places as its object some
definite end, and furnishes a specific
inspiration that would otherwise be
lacking. It is contemporaneous with
its environment, an essential part of
It. and in close smpathy with
its own age. It is, based on ascertain
ed fact, and not on opinion; on con
ditions of present living, and not of
byegone days.
Golden Rule Gnfns fci Favor.
"Today the term,'mankind' embraces
also 'womankind'. The menace of
crowded communities has given an
impetus to general sanitation and pro
tection of public health. Railway
managers hac become the most ef
fective agents of temperance; mill
mine and industrial superintendents
are preaching tiie doctrine of 'safetj
first'; manufacturers and emplojcs
realize the ethical aluc of a living
wage. The golden rule is in a fair
way to become a ital force in in
dustrial affairs All these advances
have been forced by the development
of practical Ideas among the common
people.
"The cultural education is concern
ed with the achievements of the past,
the vocational las foundations for
the futur; the old education ron
templates beauty, and imposes upon

from without; the new on clarifing
and summing up natural endowments.
Finally, the old education is fre
quently satisfied wi'h a mere discus
sion of abstract principles and human
traditions of beaut, wisdom, temper
ance, truth and justice, the new edu
cation endows these principles with
vital force by their constant applica
tion in the da's work."
Convocation closed with a selection

300 U. S. CITIES HAVE
M. U. Municipal Reference
Bureau Finds New Plan
a Success.
GIVES MORE SERVICE
Pettv Politics Is Eliminated,
As Ward "Pulling" Is
Done Away With.
About 3u0 cities in the United
States have adopted the commission
form of government and almost unan
imously have found it more success
ful than the old ma or and council
form.
Here are some of the was in which
the cities report the commission plan
superior to the old form:
It acts instead of deliberates.
It investigates instead of refers.
It is alwas in session.
It represents the people, not a
predominating party or faction.
Capable men, with the liberty
given them, are glad to serve on
the commission.
"Pull" for ward improvements,
to the neglect of the city as a
whole, is eliminated.
This information about commission
governed cities has been obtained by
the municipal reference bureau of the
University. Letters were sent to each
city that had adopted the commission
plan, asking about the success of the
new sstem. About 300 replies have
been received
Efficiency, the elimination of pett
politics and a practical business man
agement of the city are the chief ad
vantages reported. In some places
there is opposition, especially where
the system is et new, but the replies
show that in 93 per cent of the cities
the plan is satisfactory. Many oifi
cTals lmVe'replied tha their citizens
would have no other plan. There is
more service, activity and city pro
gress where the commission rule is
in use, according to the letters
The replies indicate that the loin
mission form gives nearer 100 cents of
service for each dollar spent by the
city than does the council and ma or
plan. Petty political "pulls" and log
rolling for ward advantages arp com
pletely eliminated.
WHY THE OTT GROWS
Schools Are the Greatest Asset
Here, E. W. Stephens
Tells Club.
Columbia people do not realize the
value of the town's educational insti
tutions as the vital thing which makes
Columbia grow, E W. Stephens, for
mer president of the Commercial Club,
told more than forty club members at
the weekly noonday luncheon at the
Virginia Grill today.
"The town is not awake to the fact
that more than $3,000,000 is spent
here annually by students in the Uni
versity and the two women's colleges,"
Mr. Stephens said. "We in Columbia
don't appreciate the fact that not only
do these schools bring money into the
tow n but they also bring us the moral
and intellectual benefits of associating
with the oung men and women of the
state. Columbia doesn't want an in
sane aslum or a penitentiary here."
Mr. Stephens said a cross-state rail
road would be a good thing to have,
but that it had its disadvantages
"It is not the railroads that make
a town grow. It Is what the town has
w ithin itself, this University and these.
women's colleges."
He suggested that the Commercial
Club turn its influence toward getting
a municipal building, "a place to loaf,"
for Columbia.
"There should be some place where
the clubs of the city can get together,
where the council can meet, where
people can loaf and discuss things of
interest," ho said. "A public build
ing as the get-together headquarters
for all organizations In Columbia is a
vital need. It would bring the peo
ple closer to each other. The petty
jealousies have died out here and co
operation and unity of purpose amor;
individuals is what is wanted."
Sprains Wrist In Fall on Walk.

Darkening of Sun This .Horning Has
According to Schedule.
Not man students skidding to and
from their 9 and 10 o'clock classes
this morning held in their hands a
smoked piece of glass and stopped
every few feet to look at the sun.
Nevertheless the partial eclipse, which
was scheduled to take place between
8:34 and 10:47 o'clock this morning,
happened just as the prediction an
nounced. The eclipse was observed by Prof.
R. II. Baker at Laws Observatory for
about an hour. His interest in partial
eclipses, however, is not so keen as
In the case of a total eclipse.
"Of course we like to take a look
at the sun and see that ever thing
is going off all right," said Professor
Baker. "But it takes a total eclipse
to make us sit up and use our tele
scopes. For when the sun is in total
eclipse we are able to observe many
parts of it that are not in evidence
otherwise.
"On occasions, like this we receive
some amusing telephone calls. One
man called me up this morning and
asked me what was on the sun. I
answered him by asking If he thought
it was a piece of pie. A woman called
this afternoon to ask when she could
see the eclipse. She was informed
that it had already come and gone."

TEXAS WOULD MAKE
VAN GENTITS COACH
Missouri Basketball Mentor
Considering Offer From
Southern Universitv.
HAS BEEN IN AUSTIN
Former Wisconsin Star Is
Wanted to Take Charge of
Football and Track.
"V .MlCIln FI.E OFFER,"
VA KEr MIS 0. KETUJM
"Tevas has made me a mighty
fine proposition," said C. E. Van
Gent this afternoon, "but I am not
prepared to say whether or not I
shall accept it.
"I found athletic affairs at Texas
in good shape. I was surprised at
the amount of information the pa
pers in that vicinity had concern
ing me. They even had my picture.
"Was I offered more money?
Ver naturall such a conclusion
may be drawn, I suppose, since the
job is a bigger one."
Rumors that C. E. Van Gent, Mis
souri's basketball coach, was consid
ering an opportunity to become head
football and track coach at Texas Uni
versity, were confirmed today by Ath
letic Director Chester L. Brewer at
P.othwell Gmnasiuin. Coach Van
Gent returned today from a
four-day visit at Texas University,
where lie met athletic officials and
looked into the conditions of athletics
at that school.
Mr. Van Gent's trip to Texas came
as the result of a visit made last week
by U T. Bellmont, graduate manager
of athletics at Texas, to Missouri.
"Manager Bellmont spent some time
with Director Brewer inspecting the
Tiger athletic camp, and meeting Mis
souri's athletic faculty. So favorably
was he impressed with Mr. Van Gent's
ability that before he returned to his
home he obtained the Tiger coach's'
promise to visit Austin, Texas, within
the next few das.
The rumor that Mr. Bellmont. who
is an old friend of Mr. Brewer, had
come to Columbia to offer the Texas
position to Brewer, himself, was de
nied b Missouri's athletic director
this morning.
Brewer Hopes 1o Keep Hlni.
"Coach Van Gent is a better man
than Missouri can hope to keep per
manently in so small a position as
mere freshman football coach," said
Mr. Brewer. "Besides what he has
been doing for Missouri in basketball,
his work with the freshman football
team has been excellent. I know Mr.
Van Gent is fond of Missouri, howev
er, and hope we may be able to keep!
him."
All Missouri students are familiar
with Van Gent's work as basketball
coach. Since he came here two years
ago he has introduced a new stIe of
play in basketball to the Tiger camp.
and his 1916 team, which is being
looked to by all the valley as a very
possible Valley Championship five, has
more than Justified the change from
the old to the new system. Both
Brewer and Van Gent are graduates
of Wisconsin University.
.News Printed in Texas.
"It Is only his acceptance of the
offer from the Texas authorities that
stands between his being the head of
next ear's Longhorns," says the Dai
ly Texan of last Tuesday.
Van Gent was brought to Missouri
for two big reasons first, to develop
a winning basketball team and in
crease the popularity of the Bport
here, and second, to train freshman
football candidates so that they would
have an advanced knowledge of the
game when they became eligible for
the Varsity.
While at Wisconsin, Van Gent was
one of the leading athletes of the OaJ
ger institution. He had three ears of
service in football, basketball and
track and was named captain of the
all-Western quintet his last jear in
school. He is C feet, 3 Inchej tall,
weighs 213 pounds and is 20 years old.
