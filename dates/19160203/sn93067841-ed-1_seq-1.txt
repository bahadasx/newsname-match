I WARNS THE NATION THAT NO |
TIME MUST BE LOST IN PRE- '
PARING ADEQUATE DEFENCE. 1
In his speech on preparedness at i j
Chicago Monday before an audience 1
A -Af several thousand people President ]
PV Filson said with reference to the ]
^ministration's policy. "We mean i
business." t
"We have given to the present t
fleet of the United States an organi- 1
zation such as it never had before, I <
am told by Admiral Fletcher," the ]
f President said. "And we have t
made preparation for immediate j
I^war, so far as the navy is concern- 1
ed." (

, at present constituted, "is not large i
enough even for the ordinary duties t
rof peace." <
The President repeated his warn- i
ings that no time must be lost in i
strengthening the defences of the <
Nation. He declared the Govern- 1
ment was doing everything it could !
for preparedness. 1
"When 1 see some of my fellow <
citizens spread tinder where the i
sparks are falling I wonder what
their ideal of Americanism is," the <
President said. 3
America, the President said, had
been cruelly misjudged by the Naif
tions now at war. }
^ "I know that on the other side of (
the water there has been a great s
deal of cruel misjudgment with re- t
gai'd to the reasons why America j
has remained neutral. Those look- {
ing at us from a distance do not j
feel the strong pulses of ideals and i
principles that are in us. t
"They do not feel the conviction
of America that our mission is a c
mission of peace and that righteous- <
ness cannot be maintained as a stand- i
ard in the midst -ms. They do f
not realize that U... of all of our r
B^^energy we are a body of idealists <
much more ready to lay down our t
lives for a thought than for a dollar. ?
"They suppose, some of them, that
we are holding off because we can ^
make money while others are dying, ?
the most cruel misunderstanding t
that any Nation has ever had to ^
face." {
Rulers,'not public opinion, brought r
about the present war, Mr Wilson {
declared. {
"I thank God there is no man in r
I the United States who has the au- t
thority[to bring on war without the ^
I consent of the Nation," he said,
p The task of the United States, he j
' said, has been to assert the princi- a
i pies of IjbEW in a world in which the t
* principles of law have broken down, j
H "We are not now thinking of in- (
J vasion of the territory of the United ]
States," the President declared. v
"We are not asking ourselves shall i
be prepared only to defend our
9/m homes and shores. We stand s

BY A VOTE OF 60 TO 37
Highway Commission Bill Killed
In the House Yesterday.
Columbia, February 2: ? Very
much to the surprise of every one,
the bill undertaken to create a highway
commission out of a fund to be
Jerived from automobile licenses
was killed today by a vote of 60
to 37. There were a great many
things that combined to impair the
possibility of the bill becoming law.
First, ^as the idea that a new commission
was to be established, and
the Legislature is actually afraid of
the word "commission" at this time.
Second, there were so many different
bills and many wanted their
particular view to be adopted. Third,
there was confusion as to the exact
force of the proposed bill. Fourth,
many members wanted the revenue
ierived from the automobile tax
spent immediately in the county
where the tax was collected. Fifth,
toqd fthio(?Hnn frn t)ip nprnnnnpl
UllWAV ni*u vvjvvvivM ww
)f the proposed commision. But
what's the use to figure on the reasons?
Sufficient to say to that the
jommittee and the different bills
ooking to the establishment of a
State highway commission were
tilled. There is a possibility later
)n in the session of another measure
ilong different lines being proposed.
The Williamsburg delegation vot?d
against the passage of the bill
yesterday.
IN THE SENATE YESTERDAY.
The Senate went on record by a
nore than two to one vote in favor
)f retaining the State tax commislion.
This bill seeking to repeal the
ict creating the commission was
tilled by a vote of 29 to 13, after
m extended debate for and against
fie commission. Senator Epps of
Williamsburg voted in favor of refining
the commission.
Senator Carlisle's bill prohibiting
:ock fighting anywhere in South
Carolina was passed and sent to the
louse. Under the old law cock
ighting was forbidden within three
* ? i i i rm
niles 01 any scnooi or cnurcn. ine
Spartanburg Senator said he wanted
o outlaw it entirely *ith its attendmt
"gamblers and toughs."
Other measures passed and sent
o the House were: The bill of Senitor
Nickles allowing municipalities
o enact laws confiscating concealed
veapons and contraband liquors, the
fill by Senator John F Williams pernitting
the Judges the right to im)ose
a fine instead of straight im)risonment
in cases of involuntary
nanslaughter, and the bill by Senaor
Carlisle re-enacting the Statevide
prohibition law.
A favorable report was made by the
udiciary committee on the bill creiting
the 14th judicial circuit out of
he counties of Colleton, Hampton,
asper and Beaufort and leaving
Charleston alone in the 9th circuit.
Che indications are that this measure
nil pass. It has already- passed the
louse.
The two-cent rate bill for pasenters
on railroads received a maority
unfavorable report from the
ailroad committee through Senator
ifcCown. A minority favorable retort
was made by Senator Earle.
