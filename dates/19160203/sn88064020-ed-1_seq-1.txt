The genius of past ages sought to
arouse the intellect and stir the soul
but the master minds of today are
seeking to serve. Civilization has as
signed to America the greatest task
of the greatest age, and the greatest
men that ever trod the greatest planet
are solving it. Their achievements
have astounded the whole world and
we challenge every age and nation
to name men or products that can
approach in creative genius or mas
terful skill in organization, the mar
velous achievements of the tremend
ous men of the present day. Edison
can press a button and turn a light
on multiplied millions of homes; Vail
can take down the receiver and talk
with fifty millions of people; Mc
Cormick's reaper can harvest the
world's crop, and Fulton's steam en
gine moves the commerce of land
and sea.
The greatest thing a human being
can do is to serve his fellow men;
Christ did it; Kings decree it, and
wise men teach it. It is the glory of
this practical age that Edison could
find no higher calling than to become
the Janitor to civilization; Vail the
messenger to mankind; McCormick
the hired hand to agriculture, and
Fulton the teamster to industry, and
blessed is the age that has such
masters for its servants.

SCHOOL NOTES. the
Acceding to a request of the Daugh-.
ters of the American Revolution, the
School Board decided Thursday to co
make Washington's Birthday a half ti
holiday in the schools. The petition be
from the Daughters was signed by cr
Mrs. Pendleton S. Morris, regent of
the Spirit of '76 Chapter, Mrs. Thomas lo
D. Stewart and Mrs. John Porter. na
Owing to time lost when the school in
was out of use because of storm dam
age the senior class of the Normal
School was given an extension of time
to complete its courses and the grad
uation exercises were fixed for Feb
ruary 23.
The abolishment of "Essential
Facts in History" as a reading text
in the evening schools and the sub
stitution of English Classics was sub
stituted. The classics cost 5 cents
per volume. nO
Classes in sewing were discontinued
in the eighth A grades and continued
in the seventh A, and cooking discon-M
tinued in the seventh A and continued
in the eighth A grades.
Permission was granted for a few
married women to attend cooking
classes in the high schools, provided
they comply with ail the requirements
of other pupils.
