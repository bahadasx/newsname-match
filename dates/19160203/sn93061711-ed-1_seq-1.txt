E THIEF CAP
TURED AT
The sheriff of Amarillo, Texas, wnH
hero this week on his way home from
Hoy where he captured a home thief.
It sccmi that Hoy Walker hired n
team of hordes and drove them away
from Amarillo a short time ago. He
disposed of one at Channing, Texas,
and continued his journey on horso
hnck, but Inter Hold the other horse,
lie was arrested at Hoy on another
ehargo and voluntarily told the offi
cers there thnt ho was wanted in Am
arillo. The following article taken
from the Spanish-American fully ex
plains itself:
"Deputy Sheriff It. C. Grunig met
up with an unusunl incident at the
beginning of his term of oft'ieo as
deputy sheriff. Monday morning he
was called on to tnko in custody one
Hoy Walker, who was charged with
having issued worthless checks and
getting a sum of money in change
when paying small bills with larger
checks.
When arrested Walker insisted that
he was ready to give up and quit the
game. Ho announced that he was a
horsethicf from Amarillo, Texas, and
was wanted badly there ho was tired
of the game and wanted to go back
and take his sentence. Hu talked
freely of his past, in fact so freely
that most of his hearers thought him
either romancing or demented, but ho
convinced the officer that there was
n lot of truth in his story and the
sheriff at Amarillo was wired regard
ing him nnd came back at once with
the request to hold the man till ho
enme for him.
Among the stories told by Walker
to the officers, was that hu had thirty
head of T. E. Mitchell's horses hidden
in a safe retreat and guarded by somo
of his men. He clnimed to have a
number of Americnn nnd Mexican as
sociates and to hu the head of a large
organized band of outlaws, that he
had been stealing horHes as a profes
sion for over five yenrs nnd that hu
gave up voluntarily becau.su hu was
tired of it.
It is too bad this man is not a writ
er. If his story is truu it is as strange
or stranger than any fiction and if
he iu dreaming it is still good fiction
with a moral to it in either case it
would be better reading than n lot of
the slush we get in the modern mag
azines." STEALS CLOTHES FROM II. S.
J. A. Carncr, who, it is said, came
here from Oklahoma, recently, was
arrested for stealing a coat and pair
of trousers from the High School
building. The coat was identified ns
belonging to Prof. Shadwick; while
the trousers belonged to Claude Fnits
nncht. Garner is a tall man and the gar
ments did not flit him, but his nerve
was strong and he appeared down
town wenring the combination, and
succeeded in securing a flO-dny sen
tence in the city calaboose anil hns
the cost to pay.
Carncr hns not been doing nil the
pilfering around the school buildings
but the officers are looking for some
of tho others with the expectation of
putting a few of them on tho street
gang to help grade them and other
wise improve our public thorough
fares. WHAT THEY THINK OF
REV. EVANS IN DENVER
In n special write-up by Mrs. W. L.
Stamper of tho St. Pnul's M.E. Church
South, of Denver, Cola., published in
tho St Louis Christian Advocate, ap
pears the nice compliment of Rev. A.
N. Evnns, formerly of this city, who
lately moved to Denver:
" Rev. A. N. Evans, our present pas
tor, is n worthy successor of our fore
going eminent divines. Ho came to
us nt the last session of our Confer
ence from New Mexico, ne first saw
tho light of day in tho good old State
of Texas. His father before him was
n preacher of no menn parts. Ho is
a worthy son of n noblo sire. He was
educated in the Southwestern Univer
sity nnd hns filled appointments
worthy of his merit. He is a young
man of splendid literary attainments,
pleasing manners and profound logic.
Ho is characterized by symmetry bnl
nnco and dcop-Hpirited earnestness.
Hin poiso is seldom equalled. He has
a broad vision nnd an analytical mind.
Ho plans largely, both for tho present
and tho future. His preaching is of
a very high order, nnd tho pcoplo who
wjt upon his ministry are well
plowed with 8nmo. In fact, it seems
thnt he is a man destined by Provi
dence in lead our struggling forces to
certnin victory, He is planning his
work nnd working his plnns. Ho
ensily takes rank with tho best
preachers of this city.
"As a pastor, Dro. Evans is cmi
ncntly successful. He rndiutcs cheer
fulness whercuver he goes, Ho is
fnlthful in looking nftcr tho material
welfare of his flock in their homes, ns
well n ministering to their spiritual
needs in tho church. Ho inspires
hope, faithfulness nnd optimism. Ho
is ably assisted in his work by his
accomplished and faithful wife."

of the car, an employe of Mr. Vnllan

ination it appears one ankle is bndly
mangled, onu arm is broken, and that
internal injuries were sustained. Mr.
Vullandigham, who was also in the
car, escaped with light cuts and
bruises. He was conscious when the

attention nt the local hospital.
The crossing tender clnims thnt he

A loaded coal car on the rear of tho

squarely and was derailed after pass
ing over a portion of the machine,
which was ground to bits. The young
i women were thrown clear, striking
the ground with such force that they
were instatly killed. Hoth men in
! the car were mixed up with the wreck
and wonder was expressed that onu of

injuries.
Miss Louise Vallandigham, the eld

"Salvation Nell," with Beatrix Michc

betterment of defective humnn nature.
"Salvation Nell" is a good advertise

Salvationism triumphs and the girl

CHARLEY AND GEORGE KOHN
PROMINENT QUAY COUNTIANS
The city was shocked a nuvor he
roic last Monday mo'ning when thu
word reached here of tho death of
Chas. Kohn, who only a lew days bo
f're had been mniiicd to Mia Han
nah Bonem onu of Tucumcnri's finest
young ladies.
Mr. Kohn died iu a hotel in Kansas
City Sunday night after only a short
illness. The immediate cnu.'-e as sent '
by the attending phy;cian, was raid
to bo oedema of the larynx, or serous
effusion of the cellular tissue of the
larynx. The surgeons operated upon
him to remove the trouble hut their
efforts were of no avail and thus the
hundreds of friends bach home were
soon notified of this untimely death
and Mnntoya, his home town is joined
by thu rest of the county and state
in mourning the death of one of our
most substantial ciluen.
The body was prepared for burial
in Kansas City and shipped to thh
city where the friend had gathered
to pay their lat sail tribute to hii
memory. Hi-s brothers and other mem
bers of the family came up from Mon-
toya to meet the funeral train. One
brother, George, was overcome with
grief and wai unable a stand tho aw
ful shock and during thu night physi
cians worked to faithfully to assist
him, but Wednesday morning about
eight o'clock his life r-a .-ed out.
This second shod; was about as
grunt as the fir.st and ilio citizens of
Tucumenri and, in fact. Quay county
were in deep grief. Instead of ono
funeral being held it was postponed
and a double funeral was conducted
by Rev. Dr. M. Zielanka. of El Paso,
the minister who united ('has. Kohn
in marriage to Miss Bonem only a
week before. The Masons and Elks
assisted in the funeral services and
thu church was crowded to its ut
most capacity by friends of thu de
ceased. Tlie funeral was held at the
Presbyterian church at 2 o'clock, nf
tcr which tho remains were taken to
the Sunnyside cemetery nnd laid to
rest.
The citizens of Mnntnyn feel tho
.shock much greuter than any other
community because Loth of tho men
were the life-pulse of thnt little town.
They were strong financially nnd the
citizens of that place relied upon them
to mnnngo everything pertaining to
public benefits, nllhough there aru a
number of others who may be able
to take up the duties, hut at the pres
ent thuy ure much discouraged be
cause of these untimely deaths.
It seems doubly sad to us to be re
quired to chronicle the deaths after
the flattering expectations we men
tioned in last week's paper in con
nection with thu marriage of the
younger brother. Charles, but the loss
to Quay county will be hard to recover
and his position will be hard to fill,.
The editor of this paper does not
feel capable to picture tho sadness oc
casioned by this double tragedy, and
will refrain from any attempt. The
following written by some of de
ceased's personal friends will show to
some extent how these men were held
in the esteem of all.

On Sunday night, January .'10, 1910.
Chnrlos H. Kohn. after onlv a few
hours illness, died of .sceptic pneumo-
nin, at Kansas i uy, .Missouri. At the
time of his death, besides thu medical
attendants, there was present at his
hedside Ills bride or a few nays anil
his brother-in-law. Albert Cnlisch.
Mr. Kohn was born at Las Vegas,
New Mexico, Juno fi, 187). and wns
onu of tho three sons of Snm and
Yetta Kohn. His education was ob
tained in the public schools of Lns
Vegas and the high school of Hobokcu
New Jersey. His business career be
gan at Las Vegas in 1000, and in 1902
ho, with his brothers George nnd How
nrd, removed to Montoyn in Quay
county, where they established and
built up ono of the best mercantile en
terprises nnd stock-raising industries
in Eastern New Mexico.
In politics Mr, Kohn was a republi
can, having served his party as chair
man of its Central Committee in this
county from 1910 until 1915. In 1910
he was elected on thu republican tick
et as one of tho five delcgntcs from
Quay county to the Constitutional Con
vention, having received tho next high

UBBENLY--BURIED TODAY
enri by fully two hundred members of
the Klks and .Masonic Lodges, by
whom thu ensket was escorted to the
undertaking parlors and later iu the
evening, to tho home of his father-in-law,
11. Bonem.
Funeral arrangements had been
made for tho interment at Sunnyside
cmetery, at two o'clock on Wednes
day afternoon, but about eight o'clock
Wednesday morning the funeral plans
were disarranged by thu death of tho
deceased's brother, George Kohn, who
died of heart failure, at the Vorenberg
Hotel and who, instead of being a
mourner at his brother's funeral, be
came ono of the mourned.
George Kohn, was born January 2fi,
Ifi'i.'J, at Las Vegas, and grew to man
hood theie. He was thu business mali
nger of thu well-known firm of Kohn
Brothers and gave to thu business
practically every moment of his at
tention. New Mexico has suffered the loss
of many of her most worthy citizens
during the past few months, but in
none has there been such a truce of
tragedy as that of the deaths of these
two brothers. The various communi
ties of the State have mourned the
loss of some of their most influential
men in whose (Untitling and character
the entire Statu took pride. Scarcely
had the crepe been removed from the
doors of those in Albuquerque who
mourned the loss of Hon. Harvey B.
rergusson when the people of the
same community were appalled by the
sudden death of Judge Edward a.
Mann and still before the soil above
his tomb was dry, the Hon. William
Mcintosh, who likewise was catalog
ued among prominent New Mexicans
wns gathered to his fathers and min
gled with the echoes of the hells toll
ing for funeral came the funeral dirg
es sung at the finul resting plnce of
Kx-Govcrnor William J. Mills, of Las
VcgUB.
But while all of these distinguished
persons were friends of the people of
Quny county, nnd beside whose biers
we mingled our tears, our own cup of
.sorrow hus been filled to the overflow
ing. In the late summer months the
pcoplo of Tucumenri were astounded
to learn that Doctor Richard Coulson
had died suddenly of heart trouble and
scarcely a month hnd passed before
news of tho same startling chnracter
caused badges of mourning to bo worn
because of the death of Henry Swan.
Several other untimely deaths occurcd
during the past few months, nnd while
the loss of these excellent men dis
tressed the community, thu death of
George and Charlus Kohn added trag
edy to sorrow, and ns men who had
known Kohn Brothers since their lo
catior in Quay county, met on the
streets and grasped hands, their tear
ful eyes manifested feelings that the
trembling lips could not express.
The esteem in which these brothers
wero held is best attested by the deep
sympnthy universally expressed by the
community. Every business house
was closed by common consent ns soon
its news of the death of Charles Kohn
was received and remained closed
while the bodies awaited tho last sor
rowful rites, and nt Tucumcari a great
host of friends sadly awaited an op
portunity to render the slightest kind
ly service to tho bereaved.
Last Wcdncsdny evening, ono week
before the day Charles Kohn wns ro
turned to Tucumcari in the repose of
death, his marriage to Miss Hannah
Bonem of this City, was celebrated at
the bride's homo amid universal joy,
and the richest blessings and good
wishes for the best of the good things
of a long nnd happy llfo together fol
lowed them ns they departed on their
first journey In the travels of llfo as
a happy brido and groom. No good
thing that love could provide, was
withheld from them ns they entered
together into tho joys and sorrows
which life holds. The marrlago wus
ono In which general interest and sat
isfaction was shared by a grcnt host
of friends on account of their wide
acquaintance and popularity, nnd It
seemed like a frost laid upon flowers
of June when death ctuno nnd lain
waste tho promise of their liven.
No more benutifu! tribute could bo
paid to tho life and memory of theso
brothers thnn wns manifested in the
sorrow of the native pcoplo with whom
their business had lurgely been trans
acted, and who came in numbers from
Montoyn and its vicinity, to Tucum
cari to unite tholr sorrows In ono com
mon grief nnd whoso expressions of
grief especially attest tho honor nnd
integrity of tho Kohn Brothers.
Upright, congenial and generous,
Charley nnd George Kohn endeared
themselves to all worthy persons with
whom thoy were acquainted, but it
wns to thoir intimate friends that they
wero best known nnd who alono can
fully realize tho blow occasioned by
their untimely deaths. Tho Kohn fam
ily, in Its homo relations, was looked
upon as idea!, considerate each one to
the other; the wish of ono was the
law of all. The joy of one was the
pleasure of tho others; the sorrow ot
onu was thu grief of all, and the death
of one wns at least thu death of one
other, it being sadly truo that at the
time of the death of Charles Kohn,
George Kohn was a man in tho bloom
of health and the full vigor of life,
and his own death was due to no other
cnuse save that of a broken henrt.
