KILLED BY FREIGHT TRAIN.
Fourteen-Year-Old Lafayette Lambert
Meets Horrible Death Boy Mangled
Almost Beyond Recognition.
Friday afternoon at 4:35 o'clock La
fayette Lambert, the 14-year old-eon of
Mr. and Mrs. J. G. Lambert, Jiving on
the corner of Virginia avenue and Broad
street, met a horrible death on the yards
of the Southern railway, in front of the
Bellevu hotel.
From eye witnesses it seems that
young Lambert jumped on freight No.
C5 at the passenger depot and. rode some
S3 or more feet, when he jumped off.
The train was moving slowly and he
again caught the iron rods on the side
o,f a box car, but his-feet failed to find
the foot rod, or axle box, when he lost
control and fell to the ground. Whether
he tried to roll out of the way or wheth
er the force of the fall caused his body
to roll is a matter of conjecture, but the
wheels caught his clothing and pulled
his body underneath the train, crushing
and mangling the form almost beyond
recognition.
When the train had passed over the
body on its way to the next station only
fragments of the i body were left to tell
the story of the crushing out of a yoiing
life so full of promise. Here and there
along the track were found fragments of
the body, an arm, parts of the skull
and bowels, twisted and mangled legs
and the major portion of the trunk of his
body, while the last thing to be found
further west was the head, completely
severed at the neck and one side of the
face crushed with enough of the head
left to show his facial .features.
When the editor arrived on the scene
the flesh on parts' of the body was
Pitching, showing that the accident had
just happened.
The fragments of the body were picked
up by Undertakers J. W. and R. H. Se
curest and carried to their parlors, to
be f prepared for burial.
.' ' Th4 young man was well and favora
bly known, a bright gentlemanly fellow
survived by a father and mother, five
sisters, Misses Bessie, -Emily, Cdrinna,
Lola and Esther, . and two brothers,
Messrs Gabriel and Fred.
The funeral services were conducted
from St. Mary's Episcopal church Sun
day afternoon at 3 o'clock, attended by a
large crowd of sympathizing friends. The
services were in charge of Rev. L. W.
Blackwelder, assisted by Archdeacon
Hardin, o,f Salisbury.
The floral offerings were very pretty.
The schoolmates, of the deceased attend
ed in a bedy. Lafayette had not missrd
a Sunday school lesson at his church in
five years
The pallbearers were: Messrs. M C.
Crowson, Ed. P. Parker, Robert Brock
et, Jr., H. I. Coffield, A.-D. Brockett and
P. S. Johnson.
The family have the sympathy of all
in iheir very sad bereavement.
Faints When Hears of Brother's Death.
Miss Bess Lambert, who is employed
at the office of Attorney T. J. Gold,
heard that her brother Lafayette was
kilted. Running down street to the store
of the Leonard-Beavans-Stamey Go., she
asked Miss Wilson, a clerk, if she could
tell her if the report was true. Miss
Wilson in order to break the news to her
replied that he was badly hurt, where
upon Miss Lambert fainted and it was
several, minutes before h regained
consciusness.
Mr. Beavans, the manager, rushed to
the drug store for restoratives while phy
sicians were summoned. Dr. Jackson took
Miss Lambert home in his auto and re
mained with her until out of danger.
Alleged High Pointers Skip
Court
Asheville, Feb. 2. Magistrate B.
L Lydia is looking for three men
claiming High Point as their home
who preferred to leave a Waltnam
gold watch, valued at about $30 and
two overcoats, in good condition
rather than pay fines into the court
last night which aggregated $14.55.
Five men: I. K. Greer, Floyd Reed,
Eugene Jether, John Nails, Jr., and
Albert Stencil, were arrested yester
day afternoon by railroad detectives
here on charges of trespassing on
the Southern railway by beating
their way on trains.
Two of the men paid the costs
which amounted to $485 in each
case. The other three begged the
court to be allowed time to wire
to their homes for the money, rather
than be locked in jail" all night.
This request was granted and it is
understood that the men received
the money this morning and pro
ceeded on their way without notify
ing the court of their plans.

SCREEN STRUCK GIRLS
Read What a Movie Star Has
to
Say Each Week in The Review
A Big Feature for this' Paper
Through an arrangement just con-
su mated, Miss Beatriz MicheleDa,
the operatic star who recectly
achieved fame in the motion picture
world as the heroine of such feature
photoplays as "Salomy Jane," "Mig
non." "Salvation Nell," etc., will be
come a regular contributor to th
HIGH POINT REVIEW.
Miss Michelena's articles will ap
pear under the title 'Talks With
Screen Struck Girls,1' andr will en
deavor to give an uncolored insight
into the conditio s and difficulties
surrounding the average girl's first
endeavor to break into the motion
picture profession. The hints and
advice that she has to offer . are
grounded on genuine experience.
They will tell the Bcreen struck girl
some of the things the should do,
and quite as many, perhaps, that
she should not do. They will also
try to correct for her ; many of the
delusions about the ease With Which
motion picture acting ma'ybe mas
tered and the fabulous salaries that
are said to be at once in waiting.
Unlike many other articles of like
nature, Miss. Michelena's will keep
as far as possible away from mere
generalities. She proposes to make
each talk short and poignant and
confined to one definite purpose of
giving advice and information to the
girl with motion picture aspirations.
Any letters to Miss Michelena
that you care to write will be for
warded if you will address thtm in
care of The Review, High Point,

TALKS WITH SCREEN-STRUCK
GIRLS
By Beatriz Michelena No. 1
(Copyrighted January, 1916. by Beatrix Miche
lena) Since this is the first ''talk" of
my new series, I shall use it as a
sort of preface for the?ones to follow.
The thing I would emphasize
above all others is that motion pic
ture acting is a genuinely worth
while profession from the artistic
as well as the financial standpoint
aad, as all worth while commodi
ties, can be achieved only through
hard work i patience and sacrifice.
There is no short cut nor smooth
broad road to success in it. There
is not always so much as.a plainly
blazed trail. Real ability plus a lot
of grit are the only things that may
eventually place a girl at the summit-:
'
My "talks" are not intended to
be sure receipes to an easy success,
Observation has convinced me that
there is no such thing in the motion
picture profession. I shall try, how
ever, to point oat some of the diffi
culties that the "screen struck girl"
is apt to encounter, hoping thereby
tohelp Ler avoid them, or if not al
together, ay oid, at least recognize
them when met .and therefore be
less prone to lose courage,
If a girl has not a good ; stock of
patience and a. heart for hard work

FRATERNALISff SPEAKS SUNDAY.
Tine AddressSome Great Truths Drove
Home Appreciable AudiencePower
of Brotherly Love.
Maj. J. G. Baird, grand chancellor of
the Knights of Pythias of North Caro--Una,
made a most impressive talk along
the line ctf the "Brotherhood of Man and
the Fatherhood of God" at the Firt
Baptist . church Sunday afternoon at'.'js' ,
o'clock. ' . .
Major Bt ,t)d has spent a life of servieeV
td his fellow man and his life is an ex
emplification of the principles of "dm
unto others as you would have them do .
unto you." He is principal of the Baird
school for boys at Charlotte, and has had .
the opportunity of watching develop
ments in All kinds of boys and his great:
ambition is to start them along the paths
of right thinking and right living. H .
is eincerely imbued with the principles
of brotherly love and would rather see
a monument erected to those who have
helped their fellowman and fought the
battles o,f life in a peaceful way rather
than those recording great achievements
on the battlefields. i .
Mr. Baird told, of the great work the
Knights of Pythias was doing for the
home and the' nation and what a great -help
such secret orders were to the work
of the church of the living God, which
was first of all. "If Europe had been
fraternalized like America the present
bloody war would not be in progress,"
said the speaker. "The day is coming
when the bonds of race and creed will be
severed and fraternity will sit enthroned
as the greatest lever against wars and
bloodshed the universal brotherhood of
man will be supreme." ; " V "
Grant, Lee and Jackson," were great
in their war achievements, but. their fine
manhood .displayed after the civil strife .
stand pre-eminently above their dcMs
of force and valor :on the battlefields."
His rendition of "Extending a J&elpUig
Hand" was a jem and his citations from
the classics showed him to be a master
of the art of oratory. There are xfoidull
moments in the hour spent in the rfes-
ence of this gifted platform, speaker .
ne ieaasms. nearer irwa.uie wwj'ui'
run -of things tothe highest;: form, of "
manhood and.-shows him what his maJet,.
would' have him be. One- moment you T
bask in the sunshine of beautiful,
thoughts and anticipated action, the next?"
your eyes are bathed in tears at your,
shortcomings of your inhumanity " tov
yota. fellow man and you resolve to doi
better in the future. , "
His is a great lesson to learn, the .
cup of ''right liviiig running over with ther
sweet ,f oam of joyousness to all those
who would drink and be made better . '
Those who missed the talk of MajorJ;
Baird's denied themselves of a ratre "
privilege to enjoy a blessing through hi"'
words of wisdom. &
