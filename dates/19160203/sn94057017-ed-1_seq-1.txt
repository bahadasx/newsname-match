There was a quilting party at
the home of Mrs. Roland Harwell
last Thursday, attended by a
number of ladies. Those pres
ent report a very pleasant social
time.
H. C. Wells, who now lives at
El Paso, was here last Thursday
attending to business matters.
He says his land near Estancia hi
not tor sale, tie thinks it is
good property. He has a run on
the E. P. S. W. between El Paao
and Carrizozo.
S. B. Oren has for a number
of years made tests for moisture
within a certain area of high
ground on his farm, from which
water drains in three directions.
Heretofore the extreme depth to
which he has found moisture
penetrating was 17 inches. He
made a test a few days ago, and
found moisture reaching a depth
of 39 1-2 inches. It certainly
looks more and more like beans
The subscription paper circu
lated here for contributions to
the county agent fund has sig
natures pledging nearly $400,
and the committee thinks the
$400 mark will certainly be
reached and probably passed. It
is thought that the commission
ers will pay part of the expense,
and with what can be raised in
other parts of the county the
committee believes it very likely
that the fund will reach a figure
making sure the retention of a
county agent.
The vicinity of Cedarvale is
filling up with settlers more rap
idly than any other part of the
county according to reports
reaching this office. In the past
three and one-half months forty
four families have settled in that
vicinity, and through relatives
and others it is known that
twelve or fifteen more are on the
way. The Varney neighborhood
also is getting a considerable in
flux of settlers. The farmers
around Cedarvale are feeling
good over the amount of moisture
in the ground, and are planning
to farm a much larger acreage
than ever bef jre. There will be
a large acreage of beans, and
also of forage crops. They are
also taking an interest in the silo
question, add it seems certain
that there will be a number of
silos made before next fall.
J. M. Milbourn and sons con
tinue to feel good over the silo
proposition. They are trying out
the steer feeding business this
winter have sixty head of steers
oft full feed. They get nothing
but ensilage, and are gaining at
an average rate of between three
and four pounds per day. A lit
tle figuring will show what this
means The gain in pounds does
not represent all the gain, either.
The finished steer is worth a
cent or two more a pound than
the stocker, so that this increase
in value is added on the original
weight of the steer. Mr. Mil
bourn thinks the silo is bound
to be one of the most important
items in making farming profit
able in the Estancia valley.
J. S. Corbett was arrested
where he was working about
nine miles west of Mountainair
about ten days ago, on informa
tion that he was wanted at Phoe
nix, Arizona, on a charge of em
bezzlement. Deputy Sheriff
Sears of Phoenix arrived last
Thursday with requisition papers,
identified the prisoner, and re
turned with him Friday. Cor
bett'a wife was with him where
he was working. She came over
here and left Friday in company
with her husband and the deputy.
The charge against Corbett is
made by a former employer, and
the amount involved is about
$100. Corbett claims that his
accuser is crooked and is trying
to shift the responsibility for
some of his own work.
Mr. Las well, the Otto real es
tate agent, was in Estancia Tues
day on business.

presumably looking after politi
cal fences.
The News-Herald is now in its
new quarters adjoining the old
Tuttle Btore building on the west.
Remember this when you have
business with the printer.
The almanac promised a total
eclipse of the sun this morning,
but the total part of it failed to
connect. Perhaps the planets
wobbled unexpectedly.
Kev. a. w. Means is still con
fined to his room on account of
his accident some time ago, but
is improving and hopes soon to
be able to resume his missionary
labors.
The last meeting of the Philo.
mathian Club was on Jan. 21
with Mrs. reck. Eight mem
bers and four visitors were pres
ent. The subject was Achieve
ments of Inventors," by Mrs.
Smith. The next meeting will
be with Mrs. Meador on Feb. 4.
J. H. Crawford, head of the
New Mexico Holiness School to
be established at Moriarty, came
in Tuesday to prepare for active
building operations. He says
that actual building will begin as
soon as the weather is fit.
The safe in the N. M. C. depot
at Willard was cracked Tuesday
night of last week. The robbers
got $50 in money and a few per
sonal belongings of the agent
The job was well done, and Sher
iff Meyer pronounces it the work
of professionals. There is no
clue to the robbers-
Deputy Sheriff John Baird of
Lincoln county was on the train
Tuesday with two prisoners for
the penitentiary at Santa Fe and
one for the reform school at
Springer. He says two postofflc.
es in Lincoln county have been
robbed recently. There seems
to have been an epidemic of bur
glaries throughout the state dur
ing the past month or two.
The county commissioners' pro
ceedings and other official news
matter which should have been
printed in last week's paper and
this, has been omitted on ac
count of the time consumed in
moving and resetting machinery.
We will catch up as soon as pos
sible, and meanwhile ask the in
dulgence of our readers.
Baptist Aid Society met at the
church building February 1st and
elected the following officers:
President, Mrs. Belle Wood; vice
president, Miss Chance Evans;
treasurer, Mrs. EllaFinley; secretary-press
correspondent, Mrs.
Nancy King, The day of meet
ing was changed to Tuesday at 2
o'clock, before the second and
fourth Sundays. The next meet
ing will be Tuesday, February
8th, with Mrs. Clark.
The weather has been a little
different during the past week.
There was 1 1-2 inches of snow
on the 26th of January, making
16 of an inch of moisture, and
rain on the 27th to the amount of
03 of an inch. This was fol
lowed by several days of thaw
ing, winding up with a snow
flurry and colder weather. The
snow in the valley is gone and
the freeze has made the roads
passable. The lowest tempera
tures were recorded on Jan. 31
and Feb. 1 three above zero.
The village council met last
Tuesday and took up the tree
planting question. The council
resolved to plant 200 trees in dif
ferent parts of town, and the
chool board will plant 50 trees
(in the school grounds. Private
persons who will plant trees are
requested to leave their orders
at the bank. The clerk has writ
ten to a nursery for a price on a
quantity of trees, and the small
est purchaser will get the benefit
of the price. No commiseion or
oroht will be charged to anybody.
The object is to get trees planted,
and it is hoped that the number
will reach at least 1,000. This
is not confined to Estancia.
Everybody, in and out of towns.
anywhere in the county, is invit
ed to join, and it is believed that
in this way a substantial reduc
tion in price will be obtained.

Sheriff Julius Meyer left Wed
nesday for the Imperial State
farm of Texas at Sartartia,
Texas, to arrest and bring here
Robert E. Howe, whose term of
imprisonment there will expire
February 7th.
There are six charges of bur
glary and one of murder against
Howe in this county.
The older sealers will remem
ber the case. The Howes, fath
er and two sons, resided in Abo
canyon.
For some time previous to the
occurrences to be related, which
took place in 1911, Santa re cars
containing merchandise were
broken open and goods stolen.
The cars would leave Belen all
ight, but at the next inspection
point would be found to have
been broken open and goods
stolen. J. A. McClure, a Santa
Fe detective, was put on the
case, and it is said learned that
the cara were robbed while pass
ing through Abo canyon, by the
Howes. They are said to have
boarded trains while pulling up
the heavy grades in the canyon
and running at a low rate of
speed, opened the cars and
threw out the merchandise which
was collected later.
McClure went to Abo canyon
and disappeared, and the Howes
also disappeared. A search re
vealed McClure's body in a well,
and it is charged that he was
murdered by the Howes and the
body thus disposed of.
A posse gavb chase to the
Howes, who were trailed into
Texas and cornered, when a bat
irle took place in which the elder
no we ana one oi tne sons, anu
iwo officers were killed as we
remember the story, a deputy
sheriff and a Texas Ranger.
Robert E. Howe was captured
alive. The Texas authorities
claimed him, and he was tried
and convicted in that state. Un
der the circumstances it was of
course impossible to prove that
he actually killed either or both
of the officers, and he was con
victed on a lesser degree charge.
The burglary charges against
him in this county are for break
ing open merchandise cars, and
the murder charge is for the
killing of McClure.
A SIX O'CLOCK DINNER
A delightful midwinter hos
pitality was that of Friday at the
ranch home of Berry Hues, when
invitations were issued to a few
young ladies and gentlemen to
be present at a six o'clock dinner
party in honor of his daughter,
Miss Pauline, and sister, Miss
Chance. The home was aglow
with the spirit of hospitality that
always abides in the Hues home,
and soon after the last guest ar
rived they were ushered into the
well appointed dining room.
The long table was most attrac
tive with arrangements of cherry
poinsettas and fern fronds, cov
ers being laid for Misses Annie
Porter, Ruth Crawford, Duanna
Johnston, Mamie Hayes, Delia
Means, Pauline Hues, and Chance
Evans, Mesdames M. M. Olive,
C. P. Means and R. A. Evans,
Messrs. Oscar Kemp, Jeese Mc
Ghee, Rube and Raymond Spruill,
Forest Mason,, Homer Berkshire,
Charlie Ellis, Wood Crawford,
C. P. Means, George and Ab
Engle and Berry Hues. The
menu included turkey with all
accessories and was served in
courses. After dinner, music,
both vocal and instrumental, was
enjoyed, and especially pleasing
was the duet by Misses Crawford
and Hues. It was altogether an
evening of unalloyed pleasure
and one that will long be remem
bered by those present.
SCHOOLJOTES
On last Friday we had the
regular meeting of our literary
society, which consisted of songs
recitations, etc Alt seemed to
enjoy it hugely.
School is moving on just fine
now. All stormy winds seem to
be perfectly calm or blowing in
other regions than "Alta Vista."
Our schoolmate, Pauline, had
several of us out to a six o'clock
dinner last Friday, which occa
sion was highly enjoyed.

The books in the library are
being gone over and renumbered
with the idea in view of adopting
the card and pocket method of
loaning out the books.
Mr. Stubbiefield made us a
very generous offer on his stock
of holiday books, which we pur
chased. Among them are sev
eral of the Campfire series,
which we hope will interest the
girls of the community. There
are a number of the boys' series.

us with a donation of "The
Wandering Jew" in two hand
some volumes, making with those
mentioned above eighteen new
volumes since the beginning of
the year.
We have on hand a number of
the government bulletins, which
are of especial interest to farm
ers, and will have new ones
from time to time. Among the
ones in the library are: Butter
Making on the Farm, Canning
vegetantes, roultry Manage
ment, curing and Keeping Meat,
and many more of interest.
Of course we know you may
have these for a two cent stamp
and the asking from the govern
ment, but many people neglect
to get them, so we are glad to
put them at your disposal.
In the purchase of books be
fore the last ones mentioned, we
placed three out of the number
on the self paying list, a plan
adopted by many libraries and
which generally meets with the
approval of the patrons. To
read any of the three a charge of
two cents is made. The books
on the list are: "Penrod," "In
side the Cup" and "Little Sir
Galahad." You will find them
good reading and at the same
time will be helping the public
library by giving the small sum
of two cents. Librarian.
