Many Candidates for Various
City Offices in the Field and
Other Possibilities Are Ru
mored. NEW ELEMENTS ENTER
THE POLITICAL RING
What will the Women Do?
Will the Bull Moose and
the Republicans Be Togeth-
er:
A
Some Predictions.
The city campaign has been launch
ed. It's every man for himst-lf and the
devil take the hindmost. That Is, there
are few party distinctions so early in
the city's bi-annual game of politics.
There is a particular scarcity of can
didates for the offices which mean all
work end no pay. On the other hand
there is an ample field of aspirants
for, practically, every office that has
my remuneration attached.
There are campaigns and campaigns
but this spring's performance promis
es to unearth many family skeletons,
r-any obscure places, all that is good
and, furthermore, a possible reconcili
ation of the Brotherhood of Standpat
ters and the Sisterhood of 'the Valiant
Moose. All of which does not mean to
imply that there will be any more per
sonalities indulged in than heretofore
but, considering the many varied and
perolexing elements, the affair has ev
ery indication of being the best billed;
the greatest feature of Chaplingesa
politics ever attempted in the City of
Bisbee.
In the first place, and that place
which does not vary much from year
to vear, the number of candidates has
neither decreased nor increased. It
a fact, perhaps, that there is a tri
fle more activity among the candidates
but the number is about stable.
On the other hand, however, there
are e'enients which will be encounter
ed this year that will bear heavily up
on the results and which will bear but
little prognosticating, inasmuch as
these elements are new and their ef
forts in a political campaign are un
known factors.
There's tl'O women!
As is true in art, literature, the sci
ence and even in war, the women in
politic? constitute a new factor and
though thpv voted at the last city
p'eMjon in Bisbee, yet their organiza
tions, their husbands, their sweet
hearts and their indignations had not
been utilized to the fullest extent,
either by themselves or their friends.
What will they do during the coming
spring campaign to "gum" the game,
as cherished and played by the an-,
cient and highly venered machine
system ?
The women, some say, and particu
li.'!y with reference to politics, have
n0 i Ift cf f ranization. Leave that
for the hort of platitudes Bprung at
'r t hr-ljer sessions of old time poli
ticians, for the showing made in the
general election, when the wet and
dry iFsue was under consideration
proved that either the women, or some
people who understood the feminine
mind, were extraordinary as organi
zers, i
It Is not expected that any of the
women's organizations in the city of
Bisbee will do any endorsing this
spring. But, mark us, you candidates
who may have decided opinions and
who happen to be Invited to attend
some conferences given by the fair I
sex, so prepared 'to "come through."
'There will be no equivocation with the
women. They want to know and the
man who tells then the most, and not
especially along the lines of hot air,
will get most of their support.
It is anticipated that the women
will go upon the one theory of law en
forcement. That they 'are a little un
reasonable and demand more than is
possible in this line may be conceded
but they want to know why. They de
serve to know why, and the ambitious
and self-preserving candidate will rack
his brain and, his encyclopedia for the
correct answer to the problems. There
are a few organizations, of women, al
ready making inquiries. They want
to know and, strange as it may seem,

Speaker Demands Active and
Substantial Support for His
Program During the Present
Month of the Year.
KANSAS CITY. Feb. 2 The Presi
dent demanded that steps be taken
during the present month to back him
up in defending American lives and
commerce, abroad. His demand was
met with shouts of applause from an
audience of 16.000.' The big crowd
was for the President from the start.
I assure you there is not a day to
be lost." Wilson exclaimed. "It is not
because of any special crisis, but be
cause I do not know twenty-four boors
ahead what will happen. The future
does not depend on us but upon tha
commanders of ships and submarines
and upon many other men, big and lit
tle." ' '
The crowd cheered itself hoarse in a'
three minute demonstration when th
President appeared; 16.000 beard him:
20.000 were turned away: 10.000 tried
to catch a glimpse of him as he left
his hotel for the hall. Wilson said th
time had come for him to ask bis fel
Icw citt&ens to "get up on your hind
legs, talk and tell the people who rep
resent you what the nation desires and
demands. I have come to ask you
what is back of me in this. task of pre
serving at once the peace and honor
of the country.
