this old reliable bunking institution

received with interest by the many
customers.
The Bank of Beaver City opened for
business iti Denver in 10Cr.. About a
do.-t-ir shares of stock were subscribed
by Beaver people and the remainder
was controlled by non-residents who
managed the bank. It will bo remem
bored that after a career of only a
few months, the bank was closed and
there was nothing to pay the deposit
ors. While there was no legal liabil
ity on the local stockholders to pay
mure than a few cents on the dollar to
depositors, yet these home people
those who are now stockholders In the
bank felt that there were many who
had perhaps placed their money In the
bank because of the fact that the local
stockholders were Interested in it, and
they determined to pay every depos
itor dollar fur dollar of their deposits.
These people nut only paid suillclent
money into the bank to pay oft'the
depositors in full but they also bore
the expense of re-organizing and plac
ing the bank on a substantial basis
Since that time it has been recognized
as oue of the strongest and safest
batiks In Okltihoma.
The stockholders of the Bank of
Heaver City are: Frank Laughrin.

LAWSON'S NEW. HOME BURNS.
John Lawson's new six-room bunga
low t o which the finishing touches
wore"just being added, tras burned to
the ground early Friday morning.
The fire was discovered about 1 :80 a.
m, being seen by Lynn Russell and
Harry Wood fill about the same time
and before the blaz had gained great
headway, delay In arousing help and
getting the hose cart to the scene of
the lire prevented the lire from being
controlled, and the nice new hotre, so
nearly completed and into which the
family expected to move the following
Monday, was burned to ashes. It
certainly was a great loss to Mr. Law-
son and family, not only from a finan
cial stand-point, which Ib no small Item,
the building probably being worth
at least $2500.00, but also because of
the scarcity of living apartments in
Beaver at this time.
The exact origin of the fire Is un
known. There is much conjecture as
to the probable caiiBe, some thinking
that it started from the outside and
was of incendiary origin, while others
are of the belief that It started from
stovps which were burning' on the in
side of the house to keep the plaster
ing from freezing We ore Inclined to
the latter opinion, at any rate, we
trust that that was the cause for we
would regret to think that our little
town harbored anyone who would
stoop to sucji a lowdown, dastardly
act. However, those on the isene aver
that the fire was burning from the
outside and not only the house but the
grass for some distance around was on
fire. Inasmuch a s the night was a
cold, sleety one and the grass was
covered with a coat of Ice it seems a
little singular that It would burn un
less It had been started with oil.
Mr. Lawson was fortunate In having
$1000.00 insurance on the building
which will help some toward re-building.
As a o o n as the insurance Is
adjusted 1 e expects to re-build.
6. S. Strong has been Buffering this
week with a badly sprained back, Injur
ing himself while shoveling sand at

with difficulty.
GLOBE THEATRE CHANCES HANDS.
A deal was closed the past week
whereby Kmbersou & Ileatty sold the
G!oSe theatre, to Joseph F. Spangler.
of Hlrmvood. The 11 o w proprietors
took charge of the business Monday.
Mr. Spangler had expected to build
on the lot south of the Herald oIHcp
and open a moving picture show there
but this deal will change his plnns and
Beaver will have only ono plcluro
show house for the present, which nt
this time would feem to he plenty
Since opening their theatre here
Mesar Kmbcrson it Beatty h a v e
enjoyed a good patronage and have
endeavored to give the public a good
picture show as well as special features
In the way of vaudeville and music.
We trust that the efllclent Servian
which they have given In the past will
be continued by the new proprietor
and we have no doubt but that It will
be. The Herald is glad to welcome Mr.
Spangler to the business circle of
Beaver and we bespeak for him a con
tinuation of the, liberal patronage
which the Globe has enjoyed In the
past.
' Messrs Kmberson & Beatty, who are
also engaged in the grain and coal
business will remain in Beaver. We
are indeed glad to note this fact for
they are valuable citizens a n d we
would be sorry to lose them.

addition to Mr. Taylor's advertisement
a large amount of space Is being used
by other advertisers and this, together
with our continued accounts of the
growth and developments In and
around Beaver, should certainly inter

age of the opportunity are going to he

Lands have bcen'advancing steadily in
