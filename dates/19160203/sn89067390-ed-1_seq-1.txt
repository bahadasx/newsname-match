Breaking Faith With The People
If there has ever been anvdnv.bt as
to President Wilson's attitude tow
the one-term p'ank f the B..Hinore
platform, that doubi wis dispelled by
his acceptance of the Iiidiam ballot
iominatii;K him on the Democratic
ticket for 1916, and resolved i'sslf in
to a certainty wiih the public-won re
cently of his letter of Ftburaty 1913
to A. Mitchell Palmer.
"Our platform is not molasses to
catch fl es, it means busir ess. It
mean; what it says", were the words
of Mr. Wilson spoken during his 1912
campaign. The Baltimore platform
declared for, a single presidential term
and favored the adoption of an amend
ment to the Constitution making the
President inelibible for re-election.
The plank concluded: "and we pledge
the candidate of this convention to
this principle". On that platform
Mr. Wilson accepted his nomination,
and on it he was elected in Novem
ber. 1912.
The Senate, on February 1, 1913,
adopted a joint resolution to amend
the Constitution so as to provide for a
single presidential term. In all can
dor it may be stated that the resolu
tion was not very popular with the Re
publicans who voted lor it. It was
intended so far as they were concern
ed to restrict if possible, the future
activities of Mr. Roosevi-it. But a
great many of the D'nuicrati? Senators,
relying on Mr. Wilson's sincerity,
voted for the measure, and it then
went over to the House for action.
What Mr. Wilson had privately con
sidered a jcke was in a fair way tc
become a reality, so his chief p-kes-in
the House A. Mitchell Palmer, was
called into conference, which resulted
in a letter from President-elect Wilson
to Mr. Palmer in which he said; "put
the present customary limitation of
two terms into the Constitution,
and give the President a chance to win
the full service by proving himself fit
for it". This letter was laid belore
the committee on the judiciary, which
had the resolution in charge, and the
resolution immediately became a fit
matter for reference to the commiUee
on the disposition of useless papers.
Thus it transpires that one mouth
before he took the oath of office as
President of the United States, Mr.
Wilson had broken faith with the
people who relied on the platform
promises and was a party to the vio
lation ol the one-term plank. He
stood before the great American tri
bunal on March 4, 1913, and took his
inaugural oath with unclean hands.
With such a beginning, by settirg
such an example to his followers, what
is there surprising in the fact that
every last plank in the Baltimore plat
form has since been smashed into
smithereens? It was but the natural
outcome of an Administration which
had its birth in duplicity, and which
will die "unwept, unhonored and un
sung".
New Low Record For Import Duties
For Christmas your Uncle Samuel
received from Mr. Uuderwcoci's near
free-tradd tariff law customs revenues
in the sura el Ao8S.ooo. lhis was
on imports to the value cf 830,799,-
642, or average rate of duty for that
week of 8.7 per cent. These are on
imports entered at the thirteen princi
pit customs districts of the United
States. His New Years gift for the
week ended January 1, 1916 was
S2.32S.002 of customs revenues on
(37,881,835 worth ol imports, or an
average rate of duty for the week of 7
.46 per cent, the lowest weekly aver
age rate of duty in our trade history
For the week ended January 8,1916
there entered these same thirteen
customs districts imorts to th" valuf
of 8S8.649.052 on -hich cusiotis

$3,406,356 or an average rate of duty

marked a new high record on weekly

Director Rogers of the Census Bu
reau has informed Representative Hef
in of Alabama that he will co operate
with him on his bill to require the
Census Bureau to gather and publish
additional statistics of cotton consum
ed. What in the world have those
749 special agents to gather cotton
statistics been been doing an tms
time? Simply cumbering the pay
roll? It required a force of about
740 to gather the manufacturing sta-
statistics of the recent census all over
the country. The cotton job must be
pretty soft one.
'The adverse effect of the conflict
in Europe" is the expression used by
one economic writer in reviewing the
past year. "Adverse", indeed! "Bene
ficial"' you should say. At the time
the war broke out the monthly bal
ance of trade was against us and had
been against us for four months. It
jok only 30 days to get war orders
enough to turn the balance in our favor
and since then we have enjoyed the
largest balance in our history. How
any man of both intelligence and in
tegrity can call the effect of the war
'adverse" is beyond comprehension
David Smithson Dead.

Senator Chamberlain, Democratic

U. S. Senator Lewis, Democrat, of
Indiana, has introcuced a resolution
suggesting that the Federal Reserve
Board increase the compensation of its
employees consistent with the service
done and "the increased cost of living
expenses". When a Democrat, elec
ted on a pledge of both economy and
and reduced cost of living asks (or an
increase of salaries on the ground that
cost of living has increased, there is
not much need for Republicans to hunt
for political arguments.
David Sm-.thson, one of the old set
tlers of this part of the country, died
at the home of his son, John, on Swan
creek, about three miles from Forsyth,
on Monday morning, January 31, at
the age of ninety-one years.
David Smithson was born in what
was then Warren county, Tennessee,
on the 28th day of May, 1825, where
hi lived during his boyhood. He was
a veteran of the Mexican war, having
enlisted in Co. F. 3rd Regiment, U.
S. Volunteer Infantry, serving all
all through the campaign including
the taking of Mexico City, and return
ed to his natie state after the war.
He removed with his family to Taney
county, Missouri, in 1876, settling on
what is now known as the Licklider
farm, up on Swan creek, and a few
years later moved on down the creek
and located at the farm where he died,
the place for the past several years
having belonged to his son, John.
Mr. Smithson was married Septem
ber 16, 1849, and has raised eight
children, six of whom are still living.
They are John, Mrs. J. H. Parrish and
Mrs. E. R. Everett of Forsyth, Mrs.
Ben Stone of near Forsyth, W. C.
Smithson of Keokuk Falls, Oklahoma,
and Mrs. Zine Reynolds of Nebraska.
His wife preceded hira to the Great
Beyond in July, 1890. All the six
living children were at his bedside
when the end came.
In 1878 Mr. Smithson suffered a
sun stroke, since which time he has
been afflicted with palsv, but man
aged to keep pretty active until along
last summer, when he seemed to break
down and has been steadily declining
until Monday morning when he was re
lieved of his suffering.
Funeral services were held at the
late home on Tuesday afternoon and
burul was made in the Ragsdale cem
etery. The members ol the lamily
have the sympathy of the entire com
munity in their bereavement.
A Hol'ow Plea.
Despite the fact that the exchange
rates show a heavy depreciation in the
value of the German mark and the
Austrian crown, Secretary McAdoo
and Director of the Mint Wooley, whose
function it is under the law to proclaim
foreign values every quarter, refuse to
take official notice of these falling val
ues. Jt is a matter of common know
ledge that the coins referred to have
depreciated in value, but Secretary
McAdoo denies that any depreciation
exists. The reason is simple, The
Treasury is in a horrible state, and
Secretary McAdoo is engaging in every
trickery known to a politician to raise
the greatest amount of revenue pos
sible, regardless of fair play. Import
ers of German and Austrian g ods
have repeatedly called attention of the
Treasury Department to the depreci
ated condition of the Central Powers,
as evidenced by the decline in the ex
change rates, but they are still subject
ed to the hardships accompanying the
liquidation of duties based on the
normal exchange values. Having in
s flawed the treasury balance, Mr. Mc-
false. Temror'rily cur'ail'd the Adoo finds it an easy matter to inflate
outbreak of the wax, .ti.i. ui now exebae rates.
As a matter of fact, however, there
is no prosperity in evidence aside from
that unstable prosperity that has its
rise solely in the great war. The
heavy demand for foodstuffs, horses,
motor trucks, munitions, and so on
has caused our export trade to mount
to extraordinary proportions and the
exodus of foreign reservists together
with the reduction of immigration,
have operated to eliminate the condi
tion of unemployment that otherwise
would be flagrant. When the World
asks us to believe that the people are
going to accept that kind of prosperity
as wholly satisfactory and to ascribe
the credit to the Democratic party, it
pays a poor tribute to the people's in
telligence.
We grant that prosperity is, and
should be, if it is actual and genuine City Star
prssperity, an aid to the party in power
but prosperity even of the most suo
stantial sort is far from affording com
plete assurance against political re
action. And when prosperity is of
the limited and superficial order now
in evidence, and is attended with a
rising scale of prices in flit defiance of
promises to obtain lower prices, it
comes near being an empty asset for
the dominant party. Moreover, the
trouble with our present tariff law is
not confined to its failure to bring
prosperity and to reduce the cost of
living. It has provedjwoefully defici-
Tha Federal Farm Loan Act.
Hvjsa and Stnite binking and c ur
r -icy committees are prompt with their
" port of a rural credits bill prepared
iy a j lint sub-committee, and probab
ly this one will have right of way over
any measure so far introduced, or in
the making. If the ultimate enact
ment is practically in the form of the
report it will be known as the Federal
Farm Loan Act.
With a bill actually on the fbor,
Congress and the country now have
something substantial to talk about in
the matter of rural credits legislation
Whatever merits or defcts this meas
uie possesses will be aired all in good
time. But, in one respect it may be
viewed with instant apprehension it
sets up a new commission. The fed
eral farm loan board is to be composed
ol five members, appointed for ten
year terms with salaries of twelve thous
and dollars sixty thousand dollars to
begin with.

"Without Regard"
The call for the Republican nationa!
convention has been issued. It in
vites persons who believe in Republi
can principles to participate in select
ing delegates without regard to past
affiliations." Thus is set the stamp of
the party's highest official approval on
the program of bringing back into line
the elements that in 1912 withdrew in
protest against the party crime of Chi
cago. There was more than political
need for such a sane endeavor. The
country faces new issues, new condi
tions, new problems. It is vitally im
portant that the result of an election
this year shall not be determined by
an unnatural division of the people
giving a minority the power to make a
policy lor the country. If ever there
was a time when a line-up and an hon
est verdict were needed, it is this year.
The conditions that rent the Republi
can party are of the past. New ones
have developed that make it vital that
the Republican party present its real
strength, Washington Times (Prog.)

P. H. Hill, Nebraska member of

has gazed into the crystal and predicts
that William Jennings Bryan will be at
the St. Louis convention and raise a
considerable disturbance. Shouldn't
wonder if Mr. Hall were right. On a
hasty survey one does not recall a
Democratic national convention at
which Mr. Bryan did not raise a con
siderable disturbance. Mr. Bryan is
