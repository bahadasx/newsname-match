Why
a Parent-Teacher
Association?
Because:
1. It establishes right rela
tion between parent and teacher,
changing criticism to coopers
tion.
2. Teaches each some vital
truth which both should know.
3. Forms the right kind of
public opinion and raises the
standard of borne life.
4. Cuts down discipline, reduces
friction and doubles the educa
tional efficiency of the school.
5. Makes the pupil more re
ceptive, the teacher more sympa
thetic, the parent more appre
ciative.
6. Makes the home and school
life of the child a unit.
7. Improves school conditions.
increases school apparatus, and
reforms school sanitation.
Last Friday afternoon about
30 of the school patrons met at
the High School room and or
ganized a Baxter Parent-Teacher
Association. - Mrs. A. L. Ying
ling presented the work as a rep
resentative of the National Con
gress of Mothers and made an
appeal for a deeper, more vital,
active interest on the part of par
ents in the growth and develop
ment of the child. Her address
was appreciated by all who were
present. The association elected
the following officers:
Pres. Mrs. R. C. Wear.
Vice Pres. Mrs. Ed. Covey,.
Vice Pres. Mrs. J. B. Opper
man.
Vice Pres. Mrs. M. I. Nichols
Vice Pres. Mrs. W, T. Greg
ory.
Sec Mrs. J. H. Boswell.
Treas. Mrs. O. N. Baldwin.
The next meeting will be held
Tuesday, Feb. 15, at the school
building, at which every patron
is urged to be present.
School Notes.
The attendance during the
past week has been excellent
The second semester opened
Jan. 24. A new class in general
science in the high chool has be
gun work.
Thursday and Friday of this
week the S. E. K. T. Association
will meet at Coffey ville. It may
be of interest to know that not
only teachers, but club women,
high school students, prospective
teachers, parents and profession
al men, will be welcome at Coffey
ville, and that this is a fine op
portunity to see and hear Helen
Keller at a trifling cost. Prof.
Clark's lecture-recital of Ulysses;
Prof. Scott's lecture on Dickens
and the ereat music contest
should induce many who are not
actively engaged in the teaching
profession to take part in this
great meeting.
Mr. C. II. Smith, a member of
the Board of Education, visited
the various grades last week. On
Friday morning he gave a very
appropriate address on education
al preparedness to the pupils of
the high school. He spoke of
the many schools as a long chain
and each grade a link in the
chain. He encouraged each to
be well prepared for the work
that they might take up in life.
Thoroughness in the grades was
especially emphasized. He placed
orderly conduct above book know-
edge and urged all to remember
that character building is the
most vital business in which we
are engaged.
