Passed Away.
David A. Garland.
David A. Garland, one of Bel
fast township's highly respected
citizens, passed away at his home
near Needmore, on Friday night,
January 28, 1916, aged 47 years
and 3 months. The funeral took
place on Monday, and interment
was made in the cemetery at
Pleasant Grove church. The ser
vices were conducted by Rev.
James Logue, assisted by Rev.
E. J. Croft, Kev. John Mellott
and Rev. J. C. Garland.
The deceased was a son of the
late ex-County Commissioner
Lemuel Garland, of fine physical
appearance, and apparently in
the best of health. On Tuesday,
January 18th, in using an axe,
he had the misfortune to hack
himself slightly on one of his
legs. This, almost at once,
showed signs of trouble, giving
him much pain, and swelling.
Drs. Fisher of Needmore, and
Swartzwelder, of Mercersburg,
met at Mr. Garland's home on
Wednesday of last week and
.performed a surgical operation;
but, from what information we
can gather, gangrene had devel
oped, and death resulted as be
fore mentioned.
Mr. Garland was married to
Miss Lizzie, a daughter of the
late Benjamin and Sarah Gar
land, who survives, together with
the following children, namely,
W. Blair, Levi H., Flora B., Ma
bel R. J. and Ruth V.
The funeral was attended by a
large number of sorrowing friends
whose sympathy goes out to the
bereaved wife and children.

township's oldest and most high
ly respected citizens died at the
home of his Bon-in-law and daugh

months, and 20 days. The
'uneral services conducted by his
astor, Rev. Robert E. Peter
man, of the Lutheran Church,
uook place on Friday, and inter
ment was made in Union Ceme
oery. On account of heart trouble,
Mr. Bivens had been in failing
health during the past five years,
but was only confined to his bed
for about ten weeks.
Sixty years ago, last November,
he was married to Miss Mary
Myers, eldest daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. David Myers, who lived
on Licking Creek, in the southern
part of Belfast township. Mrs.
Bivens is left to mourn the loss

A year ago Mary Roberts Rlnehart
was in the trenches on the battle
front. She Is the only woman writer
who has been granted that privilege.
She interviewed the king and queen
of Bolglum, Queen Mary of England
and General French, the commander
of the English forces. From her re
markable experiences she draws a
lesson for the patients In the State's
great tuberculosis sanatoria at Mont
Alto, Cresson and Hamburg, who are
fighting to regain their health.
Mrs. Rlnehart has contributed an
article to hid the amateur editors of
Spunk, a magazine publlshod by the
patients at Mont Alto. As she Is
the highest-paid woman writer in this
country, whose stories are worth more
than dollar a word, the Jubilation of
the editors can be easily understood.
The work of publishing the magazine
is done entirely by the patients.
Commissioner of Health Dixon has
encouraged the work, as It offers an
Interesting occupation for the pa
tients. The story Is as follows:
"To the PatieU at Mont Alto, Ham
burg and Cresson: I am sorry not
to be able to write a Christmas arti
cle for Spunk this year. One of
the things I promise mysolf, with great
regularity, Is to try to return to all
of you some of the messages of cheer
fulness and hope that you send me
each month.
But time goes by, and I grow busier,
and life presses very hard. So I
fall, and no one Is sorrlor than I
am..
It Is a great thing, this message busi
ness. There is some sort of a mes
sage In every printed word. I am
learning that every day. In the work

that I do. So It is odd to think that I,
who am well and strong, should be
looking now and then for a word of
cheerfulness from people not so fortu
nate. It la really great lesson. How
wise you all are, at Cresson and Ham
burg and Mont Altol How well you
know that of faith and hope and char
ity, the greatest of these is hope!
Hope and high courage, and battles
are won.'
There are worse things than ill
ness. There Is sickness of the heart,
which is despair, and there is sick
ness of the soul, which Is death. And
there is a very terrible thing, which
is the sickness of nations.
Last winter, Just a week or so later
than this, I was at the front in Flan
ders. The men were being changed
about in the trenches. Why? Be
cause of Christmas dayl
There had been a Christmas truce.
At midnight on Christmas eve, here
and there in the confronting trenches
men sang the hymns of the Nativity.
Eight hundred miles of armed men
singing.
The artillery duel ceased, and after
breakfast, where the trenches were
close enough together, the men held up
their Christmas gifts for the other
side to see.
The Germans, full of sentiment
about Christmas, bad many gifts. The
French and English were well pro
vided. Men stepped out of the
trenches onto the forbidden ground
between.
At first cautiously, then without
fear, the men mingled. What an ex
traordinary sight it must have been!
Men who had been trying to kill each

Miss Harriett Sloan returned
home a few days ago after hav
ing greatly enjoyed a two weeks'
visit to Washington and Mt Vernon.
other but a few hours before, and who
on the next day would again be kill
ing, meeting there between the lines,
and exchanging gifts, candy for cig
arettes, matches those luxuries of
the trenches for pipe tobacco.
All but the Belgians. Christmas
dawned a sorry day for them. They
were cut off from their homes. Not
even a card could come to them
through those lines that stretched
across their country.
But on Christmas morning came
gifts to the Belgians after all. An
Englishman had thought of them.
They got, every man of them, pipes,
pipe tobacco, cigarettes and matches.
All of that day, the strange truce
went on. When night fell, the sing
ing began again. They sang the day
out, as they had sung it in.
But the next day the men were
moved In the trenches. Hate had died
of a Christmas day, and war cannot
live without hate. The unseen enemy
across bad been seen and talked
to, and proved to be men, men
with famlllos who had sent them
gifts, men who smiled and who sang.
They were moved on, and the fight
ing began again.
So I say that there are worse things
than being ill. There Is hating, and
the business of war, and sickness of
nations.
And now, to those of you who are
so cheerfully and bravely fighting
your battle against tie enemy, dis
ease, and fighting, like the soldiers
at the front, away from your homes,
let me wish for all of you a ChrlBt
mas truce.

Law Complicated.
The farmers of Fulton county,
and, we presume, of other coun
ties, are very much at sea con
cerning the workings of the re
cent Employers' Liability Act.
They were told that they were
exempt But at least a dozen
perplexing situations have arisen
that have "stumped" not only
the farmers, but the Board and
its attorney acknowledge their
ignorance of the extent of the
law. Fulton county farmers
have asked the Board if they
would be liable for damage in
case one of tbeir regular hired
men was injured while he was
hauling lumber sometimes done
by farmers during slack seasons;
carpenters may be engaged for
a day or two on a farm and may
get hurt; threshers work for half
a day for pay and one is injured;
these and many more similar
questions have been submitted
to the Attorney for the Board
and he has frankly replied that
he either did not know the legal
answers or, "It is my opinion,"
neither of which conditions are
calculated to soothe the farmer in
to refreshing sleep. The only
tangible information gained by
inquiring farmers thus far is the
advice "When in doubt, take out
some insurance."
Druggist and Mrs. Leslie W.

Sunday evening enjoying a nice

SHOCKING AUTO ACCIDENT.
Three Women Killed on Railroad Cross
ing in Cumberland Count Last
Saturday Morning.
A special Bible Conference of
ten days is being conducted at
the Bible School of the Brethren
in Christ, which is maintained
by that denomination near Grant
ham, Cumberland county. At
5:30 o'clock last Saturday morn
ing, Daniel H. Wingert, Cham
bersburg, himself an auto sales
man, started from Chambersburg
in a Pullman touring car to at
tend this Conference. On the
front seat of the car was Mr.
Wingert's 18-year old son Nor
man; on the back seat were Mr.
Wingert's wife; Mrs. Cyrus Car-
baugh, of Chambersburg, and
Mrs. Jacob Myers and her little
three-year old child, near Green
castle. Mr. Wingert made the drive
without an incident worthy of
note, and reached the railroad
crossing at Grantham about 8:45.
Just after crossing the tracks,
they struck a heavy grade up a
steep narrow lane, which was so
muddy, that Mr. Wingert found
he could not make it, and start
ed to back the car down across
the tracks with a view to taking
another road and avoiding the
hill. It is said that both he and
his son were watching out care
fully for a train, but just as the
rear part of the car was on the
westbound track, a fast freight
bore down upon them at a 35
mile speed, caught the back part
of the automobile with the three
women and the child, sheared it
from the front end of the car as
with a sharp knife, and threw
the women and child high in the
air and the force of the fall caus
ed fractured skulls and broken
necks in the case of all the wo
men, causing death almost in
stantly. The child was thrown
a distance of forty feet, and
alighted upon a grassy bank,
practically uninjured. The fath
er and son were not greatly in
jured. The machine was of
course, a total wreck.
Mrs. Emma Wingert was a
daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs
John C. Rotz of Hamilton town
ship. She was 42 years old last
September 3 and was a devout
member of the Brethren in Christ
being a model mother and wife.
Funeral yesterday morning.
Mrs. Emma S., wife of Cyrus
Carbaugh, was 55 years, 8 mo.
and 8 days old. She also was an
active member of the church.
She is survived by her husband,
two Sons and a daughter. She
was buried Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Jacob Myers, who lived
with her family one mile north
of Greencastle, was and active
member of the Montgomery
Church of the Brethren in Christ
She was 49 years, 9 months and
29 days'old, and is survived by
her husband and six children.
Her funeral was held Tuesday
morning.
Farm Boys Get Preference.
The latest Rhodes scholar to be
sent to Oxford University from
Pennsylvania came from a farm.
He was the first member of his
family ever to have received a
college education, says Girard, in
the Public Ledger. But when it
came to keenness and intellect
and power to grasp new subjects,
this rural youth surpassed all oth
er applicants 'for this coveted
prize. W. W. Justice, Jr., who is
a large employer of labor, informs
me that,6ther things being equal,
he gives preference to country
boys. ' When I asked him why, he
Baid because they were more ob
servant, better able to rely upon
their own initiative and more re
sourceful than town boys.
Pennsylvania farms-have
reared a crop of men somewhat
bigger than their crops of grain
and fruit Philadelphia is filled
with them. Bankers, lawyers,
doctors, clergymen, railroaders,
engineers, teachers only, a few
years removed from their rural
surroundings.
WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR.
Little Talks on Health and Bjgiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL D.,
Commissioner of Beallh.
Few people would willingly jeop
ardize the life and health of a
fellow being. Yet many people,
who would emphatically deny in
tentionally doing harm will en
deavor to evade rational restric
tions necessary for the protection
of others.
In the enforcement of the laws
for the protection of the public
health, numerous instances occur
which show how the innocent are
made to suffer for the careless
ness of others. Rather than un
dergo a temporary restriction of
their usual activities, people will
often expose others to communi
cable disease, for instance, scar
let fever.
Parents in particular will of
ten assume the responsibility in
exposing their own and other
people's children which would
make them shudder if they ap
preciated the true seriousness of
it.
Measles, whooping cough and
a number of the common ail
ments of childhood are looked up
on as inevitable by people who
are ignorant of the dangers of
these diseases and the possibility
of avoiding them.
It is a crime to willingly ex
pose children to disease because
of the belief that they will even
tually fall a victim to it The
old idea that the diseases of child
hood are doubly serious to an
adult is untrue. An occasional
mild case of a disease in one in
stance may be responsible for a
serious and fatal illness from
this same disease if it is com
municated to another.
Douglass-Hess.
Avery pretty wedding took
place at the home of the bride's
mother and step-father, Mr. and
Mrs. Jacob Clouser, near Bix
Cove Tannery, on Wednesday,
January 19, 1916, when Miss Ber
tha A. Hess, daughter of Frank
Hess, late of Thompson township
deceased, became the bride of
Mr. Ira E. Douglass, son of Mr.
and Mrs. Watson W. Douglass,
near Hancock. The impressive
ceremony was performed by Rev
A. R. Garland, oi Belle Grove,
Md., in the presence of quite a
number of invited guests. A
sumptuous wedding dinner was
served, and the occasion was a
most felicitous one.
The bride and groom are most
excellent young people and pos
sess the qualifications of heart
and mind that will win success
in the battles of life. The News
extends congratulations.
Started a Cannery.
Newton Knable, of the Mea
dowgrounds, tried his hand at
the canning industry on a com
mercial scale last season; and he
is now marketing the product.
His first venture was with string
beans and corn. He found no
difficulty in disposing of his stock
right here in town to the mer
chants and hotels. 2-pound cans
neatly labeled with the word
' 'Meadowground" prominent 1 y
displayed give the can3 a real
business-like appearance. We
see no reason why "Meadow
ground" canned ' goods of all
kinds should not become a house
hold necessity in the near future
for Mr. Knable's products are
said to be fine, and can be sold
at two full pounds for ten cents.
He put up a thousand cans last
season.
Death of Infant.
Peter McEldowney Morton,
aged 6 months, and 11 days, died

and Mrs. Earl B. Morton, a short
distance west of McConnellsburg
on Thursday, January 27, 1916.
Cause of deathjwas inflammation
of the bowels. Interment was
made January. 29th in Union
Cemetery, services having been
conducted by Rev. J. L. Yeariek.
The parents have the sympathy
of their many friends.
