MORE SNOW. PREDICTS WEATHER MAN

Kven the weather man was all
disconcerted today.
" I buried my forecast with
the groundhog," he said. "1 give
up."
So it's up to the Indians and
, Taconians to make their own
weather predictions.
There was enough yesterday to
befuddle even the calmest weath
er man. But the last straw
which broke the back of his cal
culations this morning was the
fact that nearly every wire is
' down and Tacoma Is practically'
Isolated. And how can you tell
what the weather has up its
sleeve when you can't catch It on
its way?
It'» More Snow!
, But the weather man was
game. He was willing to risk
a guesM.
"I think it looks like inure
•now," he said.
And he smiled when he said It.
A steady drop in the barome
ter here is the basis for his off
hand prediction. Since yesterday
this weather indicator has drop
» ped .08 and is still on the de
cline.
Kven Old Sol was thrown out
of kilter by the record storm
which hit Tacoma. By the irony
of fate, Just as he was making a
brave effort to send down a few
warm rays, along came an eclipse
and smothered him.

Although street car service

will be clear and all cars run

stays bright. The last few cars
which were still trying to navi

last night and the freeze which
came with a 27 degree tempera

this morning out of the question.

GIVE THESE MEN THAT
BIG SNOW JOB, MR. IVSIN
Pshaw, folks, this isn't half bad! We aren't really suffering, you know; it's simply a case of incon
venience. A few of us have had to walk to work, and we've had to forego a few concerts and entertain
ments and a little curtailed business. But as soon as it's over business will be better than ever and the
I conveniences of everyday life will seem twice as valuable.
* ■ * *
Besides, the bother caused hy the snow can be mostly done away with if we each one does his part.
What we need today is a little co-operative community effort. Which brings us to our pomt —
Let's dig in tonight and tomorrow and clear every sidewalk in town, scrape the crossings clean and
put our town to rights. Don't say, Mr. Householder, that you can't clean your walk because you have
the grip, or are afraid you are going to have, or don't own a shovel, or aren't strong enough, or haven't
time enough, because—
* * A $
There are hundreds of men temporarily out of work who can do it for you. The mills, many of
them, have been obliged to close down and many lines of employment are blocked. So put one of these
men at shoveling snow. He won't charge much. You won't miss the change. It will help him tide over
a hard spell. And it will make our town ten times as convenient a place to get about in.

Don i know just where ft) lay your hand on a mnii. Well, we just fancied that fa Rood many of you
WOttld make that remark. But we do. Or, at least, we will as soon gi ihis edition liak been on tile streets
■ few minutes. For, The Times hereby volunteers to serve as a clearing house. We are going to help
mobilise the snow-shovel army and put it at your disposal, Mr. and .Mrs. Tacpman,
It's this way: You just call Main 12 (The Times' number) and give your name and address. Say
that you want one man or two men or however many men you can use. We'll put you on our list of folks
who want shovelers. Or, if you need a job and can shovel, call Main 12 and say so. You'll go down on
the other list. And the man who wants a shoveler will get him just as soon as we can tell Mr. Shoveler
so, and vice versa. We anticipate that Main 12 will be about the busiest phone in town for some hours,
and we hope it will. We hope it will be busy with about an equal number of the two kinds of calls.
Then watch the snow fly. With the city mobilizing another army to clear crossings and streets, a day or
so ought to see everything in apple pie order once more.

And one more thing, Mr. Householder. If the man does a good job on your walk and there is a vacant
lot next to you, have him tackle that, too. It will cost only the price of a cigar or two, and it will giv«
you a comfortable feeling to see all that walk bare.

All streets leading to the heart
of Tacoma at an early hour this
morning resembled a retreat
from Moscow. Business men
and women bent on being on the
Job at any cost, trudging along
the car tracks In one thin single
file, plowing through snowdrifts,
slipping on the Ice and hoping to
get there some way.
The first tie-up of street cars
in Tacoma occurred at 3:50
yesterday atfernoon, when South
Tacoma car No. 134 suddenly
"went dead on the Delin street

wind had chilled the snow and
formed a coating of ice on the
rails.

While street car men worked
frantically to make the wheels
grip the rails, other southbound
cars came up and stopped behind
the stranded car. Passengers
alighted and began "hiking."

From Recent

These outlying districts have grown up, depending upon ottc car
lines for a reliable, continuous service, irrespective of seasons or,
weather.
And we ask the public to remember, next summer, how the "Old
Reliable" stuck by the guns and how the little bounce buggy drivers
forgot their dear patrons and stayed home and toasted their shanks
In front of their respective fireplaces.
The public demands that this company run its cars regularly
and continuously; they hold it accountable for a satisfactory, con
tinuous and adequate transportation service at all times, no matter
what the weather.
We have bent every effort during the last few wekes to maintain
our schedules and "The Old Reliable" street car has not broken
faith with the people.
We're Proud of
Times Carriers
We take our hats oft today to
the red-blooded youngsters who
trudged along their routes in the
