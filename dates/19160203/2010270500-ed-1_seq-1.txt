PITTSBURG SPEECH,
'
Opposes Taking Advice of Profession
als on Some Questions.
Pittsburg, Pa. Tho president de
clared against the taking of advlco of
professional sailors and soldiers on
some questions in his Pittsburg ad
dress. "It Is time that we attempted, at any
rate, to apply the standards of our own
life to nation defense. What do we
want to defend? Need I answer? We
want to defend tho equal honor of a
nation against all other nations, and
we wish to maintain the peace of tho
western hemisphere.
"WJiere are our great needs of de
fense? "Did you over stop to reflect just
what it is that. America stands for?
She sianda for the sovereignty of tho
self governing peoples of the world.
Our assistance, our encouragement,
has thrilled two continents in this
western hemisphere. This is what wo
stand for.
"It seems to mo that America Is In
love with efficiency. Material effici
ency of which wo hear so much, only
underlies purpj3s.es, which Lmay- call
Epintual efficiency.
"I, for my part, have a gieat enthus
iasm for rendering America spiritually
efficient. The plans for our military
efficiency do not piovido for a gieat
army. Wo want only an army neces
sary for the use of peace, but we want
back of that an army of trained men.
These men should bo civilians, men
who know that tho arts of peace come
beforo the arts of war.
"Men should dread war and know
that everything on which the nation
depends come from peace.
"Tho details of the army plans do
not make any difference; perhaps
others have a better plan. Rut I do
want an adequato and efflcienct force
of at least 500,000 men trained in the
arts of war who will be ieady to pro
tect, the nation.
"So far we have held difficulty at
Tin's length by patience, and I hope
we will continue to do so.
"Peoplo tell men I must maintain
peace and also the honor of tho coun
try. Perhaps I shall not be able to do
both. I seo no Immediate danger, but
you must bo ready If trouble comes.
"I want every one of you to stand
behind the government In what It is
doing 'or the national defense."
Explaining IiIb army plans, the pres
ident said the nation must have a body
of civilians familiar with camp life
nnd sanitation, the use of arms and
the rudiments of military training.
WILSON WARNS NATION.
President Says Country Must Prepare
for Possible Trouble.
Cleveland, O. President Wilson,
speaking, as ho said, "solemnly,"
warned the nation that the timo may
come when he cannot keep the United
States out of war and maintain Its
honor and declared that tho country
must be perpared to defend Itself and
bo prepared at onco.
"America Is not afraid of anybody,"
ho said. "I know I reflect your feel
ing nnd tho feelings of nil our citizens
when I say that the only thing I tm
afraid of Is not being ready to per
form my duty. I am afraid of tho
danger of shame; I am afraid of the
danger of Inadequacy; I am afraid of
the danger of not being able to ex
press the correct charactor of this
country with tremendous might and
effectiveness, whenever wo are called
upon to act In the field of the world's
affairs."
The president spoke in Cleveland
Jan. 29 with more gravity and force
than he has shown during any of his
previous addresses oit preparedness.
He was applauded frequently and
when he Mioko of defending the na
tion's honor, the cheering was lie
mendous. Must Be Done Now.
"Lot me tell you very solemnly,
jou cannot postpone this thing," he
declared. "I do not know what a
single dtly may bring forth. I do not
wish to leave you with the impres
sion that I nm thinking of gome par
ticular clanger.
'I merely wish to toll you that we
are daily treading amidst intricate

Largo Audience Composed of Many
of Foreign Birth. .
Milwaukee, Win. President Wilson,
speaking bcfoio tho inrgost crowd of
hid present trip, doolnred tho mon who
nay Americans will not stand together
In timo of trouble "have shot, their
bolt." v
"I have not supposed that tho mon
whoso voices seomod to show a throat
against u represent oven tho people
they claimed to represent," ho snid.
The president spoke to an nudlonee,
many of whom were of foreign birth.
He declared ho. know tho men who
camo from forolgn lands to America
loved liberty nnd would stand b tho
idoals of America.
NAVY READY FOR WAR.
Sea Force Too Small, However, Says
Wll3on.
Chicago. The United States has
made preparations for Immediate war
as far as tho navy Is concerned, al
though tho present naval force Is In
adequate In size. President Wilson de
clared In an nddrcss beforo several
thousands of persons in tho audito
rium here "Wo mean business," ho
said, in speaking of the preparedness
plans of tho administration.
"Wo have given to the present fleet
of tho United Slates an organization
such as It never had before, I am told
by Admiral Fletcher," tho president
said. "And wo havo made prepara
tion for Immediate war so far as tho
navy is concerned."
The army, the president snid, as at
present constituted, "Is not large
enough even for the ordinary duties
of peace."
Tho president repeated his warnings
that no time must be lo3t in strength
ening tho defenses of the nation. Ke
declared the government was doing
everything lt could for piepajedness.
America Misunderstood. ,
America, the president said; had
been cruelly misjudged by the nations
now at war.
"I know that on the other side of
tho water there has been a great deal
of cruel mi3judgmpnt with regard to
tho reasons why America has icmain
ed neutral. Those looking at us from
a distance do not feel the strong pulses
of ideals and ptinciples that aro In
us.
"They do not feel ihe conviction
of America, that our mission Is a mis
sion of peace and that righteousness
cannot be maintained as a standard
In the midst of arms. They do not
rcliyo thatUack ,o all. flur cjiorsy'
wo'nro a body of idealists much mora
ready to lay down our lives for a
thought than for a dollar.
"They suppose, some of I hem, that
wo are holding off because we can
make money while others aro dyin.
tho most cruel misunderstanding that
any nation has over had to face so
wrong that lt seems almost useless
to try to correct it. because it shows
that tho very fundamentals of our life
are not comprehended or understood."
Rulers to Blame for War.
Rulers, not public opinion, brought
about the present war, Mr. Wilson de
clared. "I thank God there is no man In
the United States who has the author
ity to bring on war without the con
sent of tho nation."
The task of tho United States, he
said, has been to assort tho principles
of law in a world in which the prin
ciples of law have been broken down,
"We are not thinking of Invasion of
tho territory of the Unitod States,"
tho president declared. "That Is not
what Is making us think. We are not
asking ourselves shall we be prepared
not only to defend our own homes and
our own shoies.
"Is that all wo stand for? To keep
the door shut securely against our ene
mies? What about tho groat trustee
ship set up for liberty of national gov
ernment In the whole western hemis
phere? We stand pledged to see that
both the continents of America are
loft to be used by their peoplo as
those peoplo choose to use them un
der a system of national popular sov
eioignty as absolutely unchallenged as
our own."
WILSON GUEST OF IOWA.
An Enthusiastic Greeting Extended
b,'' Hawkeye People.
Des Moines, la. President Wilson,
speaking here February 1, dealt with
the futility of messages and words of
protest to meet breaches of interna
tional law.
"Do you want tho situation to bo
such that all the president can da Is
to write messages and uttor words of
protest?" he asked, In advocating pre
paredness beforo tho laigest audience
of his present trip.
"Why, to ask that question is to an
swer it," ho said.
"Whenever International law In vio,
lated by ono or the other belligerents,"
the president said, "American was
called upon to roglster a 'voice of pro
tost, of Insistence,'
"Do you want the situation to be
such that all tho president can do Is
to write messages and utter words of
protest? If these bleaches of Inter
national law, which aio In dally dan
ger of occurtlng, should touch the very
honor of tho United States, do jou
vlnh to do nothing about It? Do you
wish to havo all tho world say that
the flag of the United States that wc
have can bo stained with impunity''
"I know there is not a man or wom
an within the hearing of mj voice who
would wish poaee nt the expense of
the honor of the United Statos,"
Shortly before leadline Des Moines
