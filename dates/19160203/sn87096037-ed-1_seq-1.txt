Where to buy the BEST groceries
when every groceryman claims to

learn where the Really BEST goods
come from.

STREET CORNER SAGE,
Let Us Halt War.
The Sage stood in the post
office lobby, reading the war
news over the shoulder or a man
who had just received his daily
paper.
"The United States is shore
goin' to have to look out, 'er
they're goin' to git into this af
fair yet,'' he asserted. No one
seemed interest enough to start
an argument, but the old gentle
man was not daunted by the lack
of attention.
''It's a shame th' way we've
been lettin' these here other
powers tramp on our toes. Wish
I was president fer a while, er
somethin' where a feller could
put some real intelligence to
work. 11 I wuz we'd own Mexi

have the whole rest of the world
afraid to fer fear this country
wouldn't approve of 'cm usiii' so
much air. Why T'dhavn—"
The owner oj the d. '.!y paper
interrupted.
"Who'd do all the fighting
Uncle?" he queried. "I suppose
you and your sons are willing to
lay down your lives to keep other
'sWnons "&-6?a"f5e1ing free to^in
hale ozone."
"No sir-ee" replie the Sage.
"There is plenty of other fellers
