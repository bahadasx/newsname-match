TROOPS RAID ST. BER
NARD GAMBLING SALOONS
100 Arrested In Bagneris' and Zim=
merman Saloons By 25 Wash
ington Artillerymen.
Asquad of five men, under
command of Li. ut. Nathan of the
Washington Artillery raide: the
saloon of Alphonso Hassanbeei
ler, in North Peters street near
the i lInt of the American Sugar
Refinery, about 1 o'clock Sunday.
The place i; known as the Phoenix;
saloon and also as "Tne buceket
of Blood." The Iplace was closed
when Gov. Hall' militia approach
ed.
The troops broke open the
doors and confiscated Hassm
boehler's effects, which were
thrown in the street and burned.
No arrests were made at this
plac.
The raid by the troops into St.
Bernard followd an expose in the
States Wednesday in which Man
ual Estopinal of St. Bernard,
openly charged that the Govern
or ignored his charges that gamb
ling flourished there while, at the
same time, the chief executive
of the State sent troops into Jef*
ferson parish to "clean up" the
parish.
District Attorney N. H. Nunez'
own little raid was staged at 10
o'clock and ,with Constable J.
Serpas and Deputy Sheriff Hahn,
he entered the place of Peter
Lamich, saloon keeper, at An
gola and St. Claude Streets.
Four or five negroes got away,
but the troops caught seven ne
groes and confiscated several pair
of the dice and some money. The
saloon keeper, Lamich was ar*
rested.
Sheriff Estopinal, it was stated
by the district attorney, issued
orders during the week that every
means be used in crushing the
gambling houses in the parish.
"Some of the gamblers of St.
Bernard parish seemed to think
that my term as governor expired
with the holding of the primary
last Wednesday, but until Maiy 15
they are going to find tdat I am
very much governor so far as
obeying the law is concerried,'
said Uov. Hall to a Times"Pica
yune reporter Sunday afternoon,
when interviewed regarding the
gambling raids made by the
Washington Artillery in the
Stockyards neighborhood of St.
Bernard parish Saturday night.
"I have no intention of declar
ing martial law in St. Bernard
parish, as I have confidence in
Sheriff Estopinal, District Attor
ney Nunez and the courts of the
parish. It is true that Sheriff
Estopinal advised me that he
could not find gambling in his
parish, but he lives quite a dis
tance from the stockyards neigh.
borhood, and it is possible he was
misled by men working for him.
"There has been spasmodio
gambling going on in this section
but it was kept rather quiet until
after the primary. I learned from
reliable authority that Louis Bag
neris made the boast that as soon
as the primary was over he was
going to open up in full swing,
and I had my representatives to
look out for this. As soon as they
ascertained that gambling was in
existence I ordered the raid. Mr.
Hlaganeris had made his boast to
she wrong person."
