PIC FOR 1 DAYS
Men are benefited by this opportunity as well as women. This white sale will' draw the people.
I That is because of the great values.. We might fill columns with descnptiohs of items and we
would, but for the fact that mere description is not conclusive without personal inspection of the
Qualities. Only by handling the goods and subjecting them to the closest inspection can you fully
appreciate the lovrness of our prices. .
There are other white sales. There will be other white sales. The more the better for us. If there
were no competition, there would be no standard by which to estimate the superiority of these values.
