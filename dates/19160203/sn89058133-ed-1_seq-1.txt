Cookeville Camp held an ex-
, tra good meeting Tuesday night
- Feb. 1, with Consul Chas. Stan
ton presiding, and a splendid
crowd of. neighbors present
After the usual business had
been disposed of, trie new pass
word was given out by the
Consul, and neighbor E. ' B.
Duke, who has recently been
appointed as assistant' district
deputy, was present and spoke
a few words of encouragement
to the boosters of Woodcraft
, One applicant was 'taken in'
and shown the mysteries of
Woowcraft in va befitting man-
ner
The putting on of the degree
work is stimulating interest in
the order, and with the new
ritual the w ork is beautiful and
impressive. Several candida
tes stand awaiting adoption as
neighbors, so there are pros
pects of more of this work for
several weeks. , Every neigh -
bor should make it a point to
come out every Tuesday night
The year 1915 closed with a
bout one million members in
the M. W. A., and with a sur
plus in the benefit fund of over
twelve million dollars ($12,
000,000.00) an enormous sum,
and be it remembered that ev
ery penny of this is used for
paying the death claims of . its
membership. . The business
done by this society for -only
one month is vast. Take for
example, an average month,
last November, the sum of $1,
135,406.70 was received from
the members, .through more
than 14,000 camps; and 567
death claims were paid, amount
ing to $1,003, 836.00.
By reading the following edi
torial from the January Mod
ern Woodman Magazine, one
will clearly see that Wood
craft's message is one of ser-
vice: , ... .. . .
"Nlneteen-sixteen dawns bri
ght with promise for the on
ward march of Modern Wood
men of America in the great
field of benificent effort it has
.occupied for lo! these many
years. In no preceding twelve
month period has the world
been so awakened to the neces
sity of brotherhood among mer
The message of our Society is
one of service for mankind, and
that is the message that is Pul
sating today in all -parts of our
jurisdiction, as a new dawn is
ushered in upon us. Fraterni
ty, mutual help, man'sdepen
dance upon his kind, are some
of the things it stands for.
Then there is the genial, red
blooded glow pf its good fellow
ship. The new year will be
better, brighter with, less of
v sorrow, less of misery, becaus
the members of Modern Wood-
. men of America are good fel
lows, and because it is the mis
'Sion of our Society to live in a
house by the side of the road
and be a friend to man."

Health is very, good in "this
t community. , There has been
several cases of lagripPe.
Weddings seem to be the or
der of the day in this part
Rev. Jack Massa was married
Thursday, Squire Grundy Jack
son officiating. It seems that
there is not going to be any
one left for Sam Gentry and Ar
thur Stout, as they seem to be
uneasy.
Alf Maxwell has gone to
Nashville to have an operation
for appendicitis,
v Sam Gentry and Arthur
Stout visited Cookeville a few
days ago and say it is a good
place to go. - r
Business seems to be very
dull at W. H. Cqle's store, as
governor Frank Moss - chair
was vacant today President
D. Maxwell seems to be trans
acting a lot of business,, as his
chair is never vactnt at W. ' H.

MISSION STUDY CIRCLE
The Mission .Study Class met
at the First Presbyterian Chur
ch the last Tuesday in January
at 2:30 to discuss "Home Mis
sions as Sources of Power."
This chapter finished the Pres
ent book. To say that we have
all been greatly benefitted, and
inspired to deeper convictions,
and greater desires to do mis
sionary service, is telling the
effect that this book has had
upon the class. This last chap
ter was the climax of the whole
two months study, teaching us
of Christ as the Great Mission
ary, giving us greater desires
to seek a new realization and
understanding of His charac
ter and purpose; and for what
He lived.
Our next book will be a For
eign Missionary study "The
King's Highway." The first
lesson in this new book will be
had on Feb. 15, at 2:30, at the
First Presbyterian Church.

men or girls, who will, to join
the class. Mrs. O. D. Massa or

your book.

That Cheerful Friend
When all the world seems kind o' wrong,
Arid things dn't goin' right,
And when you've got the blues bo bad,
You'd most give up the fight,
Your cheerful friend comes down the street;
He greets you with these words:
Old chap, you're lookin' fine!"
You've simply got to tone up then,
No matter how you feel;
The world takes on a different look;
A smile begins to steal
Across your beaming countenance;
The very air is wine;
You pass on with the knowledge that
"By George, you're lookin' fine!"
You soon forget your aches an' pains;
It puts you back in tune;
If there's any better tonic,
It would be earth's greatest boon
The friend who slaps you on the back
With gusto half divine,
And says to you, "By George, old chap,
You're looking simply fine!"
FOUR-YEAR GARDEN
COURSE FOR GIRLS.
To meet the demands of
thousands of southern - girls
who have been successful in
raising a tenth-acre of toma
toes and who want to "go on,"
the representatives of the De
partment of Agriculture and
the State colleges in charge of
the canning clubs in the fifteen
Southern States have worked
out what might be called a pro
gressive, four-year practical
garden and canning course for
girls. The purpose of this
course is to start the girls with
one crop and from" year to year
add new annual crops, encour
age them to run winter apd
glass-frame gardens, and final
ly in the course of their work
to lead them to Plant perennial
small and orchard fruits. It
is hoped that under this system
the girl will gain knowledge of
how to, handle a wide variety
of garden vegetables and trees
and that the member by the
time she gets ready to go to
hish school or college will have
n. erarden of perennial fruits!
that readily can be cared for
by other members of her family
The first year of girls' club
work throughout the Southern
States consists in raising toma
toes in tenth-acre gardens. It
is believed by those in charge
that every girl should first mas
ter this plant and learn how to
utilize or Sell its products be
fore she takes up other vegeta
bles and fruits. !n sections
where tomatoes suffer ' from
blight and wilt, however, it is
sometimes necessary tb substi
tute another garden crop. .
The second-year girls con
tinue to stow tomatoes on one
half of their garden space and
devote the other half of the
space to one otner crop, orei-
" crops recummeuueu.
The third-year girls grow
three croPs, continuing the
two that have been, grown the
second year and adding cucum
jbers, eggplant, fi tomatoes,
right, to substitute rrom 5 to
.10 fruit trees for one of
the
vegetable , crops. The member

'By George,
perennial vegetables and fruits
is insisted on at the end of the
third year, and in many cases
the work is begun at the end of
the second year. The Peren
nials are substituted for some
of the annual vegetables and
the girls are given credit for
the condition of their bushes
or trees which are not yet bear
ing and therefore do not yet
yield a product that can be
counted in the canning score.
It is hoped that as a result of
this planting of, perennial fruit
and vegetables several thous
and gins, oerore many years
will have at the end of their
junior garden permanent gar
dens containing some such pro
fitable combinations as the fol
lowing:
Strawberries, asparagus, and
cherries. Raspberries, rhu
barb, and plums. Gooseber
ries, currants, - and peaches.
Strawberries, asparagus, and
quinces. Strawberries, rhu
barb, and pears. Dewberries,
figs, and pecans. Currants, as
paragus, and srapes. Black
berries, figs, and scuPpernongs,
Strawberries, figs, and oranges.
Asparagus, strawberries, and
kumquats.
To enable them to usfc the
products of these permanent
gardens, the agents give the
girls special instruction in mak
ing preserves, jelly, marmalad
es, pickles, etc. '
