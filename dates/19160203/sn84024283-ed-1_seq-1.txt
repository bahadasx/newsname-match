The war is still grinding tut is grist

- The following is taken from a letter
to the Bismarck Gazette by U. F.
Hunt of Bismarck:
Big day in MoAlester Sunday in the
churches. This is the fourth week of
the meeting. Sunday night the
churches were filled to overflow and
many souls were saved. Bro. Cul
peper has awakened MoAlester as
never before. ' He said card playing,
theater-going, dancing, picture shows,
the oil wells, gas fields1 and automo
biles were the. people's Gods, and
they were going to hell faster than
the speed limit. ;
I plead guilty to some of the fore
going allegations against the unregen-
. erate of MoAlester, but my skirts are
clear from oil wells, gas fields and
automobiles. , Poverty sometimes
damns, but it also frequently is a
shield against thedeil and his works.
It suits my taste, does the follow
lng pronouncement of the- Sikeston
Standard. "Beware the Greeks bear
lng gifts" of any sort, more especially
in the form of advice. It is a good
' tiling to reject the counsels,iot only
of the enemy, nut also of the dicta
tonal, so-called independent paper
which basks in the lime-light Of dis
turbance and disaffection. When the
Democratic party ceases to possess
intelligence and virtue necessary to
choose faithful and competent leaders
it should step down and out:
, The Standard isn't worried ao very
much about the personel of the next
Democratic ticket. The men wao are
to be chosen by the Democrats of
Missouri in the next State primary
are going, to be 'good men, because
Democrats don't nominate any other
kind; and they will be chosen by the
Democrats, too not by the Repub
lican newspapers of St. Louis and
Kansas Oity. Here and now, once and
for all, we beg to Btate (for the benefit
of onr journalistic brethren of the Re
publican party) that when the Demo
' cratio party places the seal of its
approval upon any candidate that
man will at once become the candid
ate of the Democratic newspapers of
Missouri. ' -
IN a debate with Congressman
Sliackleford last Week Congressman
Gardner of .Massachusetts heaped a
tirade of abuse upon Missouri. Gard
ner is a Republican leader, and an
agent of the steel trust. He denounced
' Missouri as a former slave-holding
State, and said that our people were
brought up "under the civilization of
the shotgun." It ia true that Missouri
was formerly a Blave State. The
younger generation may not know
that Northern states, too, a long time
ago were slave states and only ceased
. being so when it became more profit
able to thea t'2'' .ill their negroes to
the South than to retain them. More
than all, is not Massachusetts a slave
' state to-day? , The country has not
forgotten the recent labor riots at
Lowell, when the nation's hep.rt went
out In sympathy for the' white slaves
' of the Massachusetts cotton mills.1 In
view of the indUHtrial serfdom exist
lng In lila own' State, it 111 becomes
this New England yankee to taunt us
with the fact that we once, owned
Prince Albert
such friendly tobacco
that it just makes a man sorry he didn't get wind of this
pipe and cigarette smoke long, long ago. He counts it lost
time, quick as the goodness of Prince Albert gets firm set
in his life ! The patented process fixes that and cuts out '
bite and parch I
Get on the right-smoke-track 'soon as you know howl
Understand yourself how much youll.like

It stands to reason, doesn't it,

Rev. J. F, Milbank rector of St.
Paul's Episcopal Church at Eellington,
Kansas, writes as follQws in the St.
Joseph, Missouri, Observer:
"You-ask for my opinion in regard
to this great issue. First, let me say,
I dislike prohibition intensely. To my
mind it is all wrong, or at least it goes
about that which it UesireB to accom
plish altogether in the wrong way. To
my mind prohibition is tantamount to
moral weakness. 1 have seen a great
deal of it have watched its comings
and goings, and have even done my
best as a just-mindecj man, to see
reason in it. ' To me it stands weighed
in the balance, aud as a working fact
or, even in that which it desires to
accomplish or promote, found sadly
wanting. I believe a nation of pro
hibitionists would be a nation of
hypocrites. Prohibition breeds and
fosters suspicion among neighbors. It
means 'behind doors.' It means all
that is not open and above board. It
not only breeds a sort of secretiveness
of one's actions, but, worse still, it
introduces a condition repulsive to
any free English-speaking citizen. I
hate drunkenness; it is beastly, inex-
cuaable; but I fear and loathe pro
hibition still more. 'I would rather
see a son of mine come home drunk
(beastly as that would be) than to
think my boy was a sneak and a liar.
You can cure and sober a drunkard.
Many have been redeemed. But never
yet have I known a sneak or a liar
changed into a decent man. No, I
hate prohibition intensely; as I have
said, It breeds dishonesty and a lack
of candor, and were my churchthe
Episcopal to commit itself to sucn
an unscriptural platform (as many
churches' have) I would resign to
morrow, send in my vestments and
go.to work at something else. Tem
perance is one thing (and it applies to
all our appetites and desires); pro-
hiDition is quite anotner. The one is
strength the other weakness. After
living some years in an anti-saloon
state I have come to the conclusion
that the absence of the (licensed) sa
loon proper by no means abrogates or
does away with drinking or' drunken
ness. It only seems to me to help the
druggists grow rich on that pernicious
'signing a lie,' as I call It, when a man
sneaKS.lnto a drug store and wmspers
what he wants holds up his hand and
swears."

From Mr. Scoggln.
Editor Register It has has been
some time since you have heard from
me and I have something that I think
is very important for all farmers to
know in this part of Southeast Mis
souri, especially Iron, Reynolds, and
Wayne counties. In my judgment
there should be no more butter sold
tor iu ana cents. As we have no
regular payroles in our county, we
can make a regular payrole every
day, to consume the produce from
these counties. We have been tryin
it nere at Uiover. . We have some
good cows that we didn't care to sell
and my wife would have them at
tended to, and she made from 6 to
10
pouuds of butter per we ok. The lat
ter part of December, "I carried
pounds 'to Ironton, .as fine butter
a
you ever looked at, and I was offered
the full amount of 22) cents cash pe
pound for it. I said to the gentleman
"It is very kind of you to offer me
that, but I have none to solr at that
price." This made me go to thinkin
again, as you are aware that I have to
think more than a great many other
people, and I decided to get a Sepiira
tor and try the butterfat, and took
the matter up with the Fox Rive
Butter Co., in St. Louis, and they
quoted me butterfat at . 3.1 cents per
pound. This looked much better to
Mlosourlan than 22,VJ cents. I went
to investigating the matter furtho
and I found that the express compan
would carry 100 pounds of this cream
to St. Louis for 28 cents, and return
the cans. I must stop here and say to
you that the express company has in
sulted an express oflloe here at Glov
er, with your humble servant as
n.ent. f
We received the Soparator and our
cows glye' 10 gallons of cream
per
week that we want to sell, and we get
16 pounds butterfat out ot that cream.
I will say that our cows made 10
pounds of butter per week at 25 cents
per pound, which was equal to $2.50,
and we had either to carry that off or
send it by parcel post, or express,
that would cost more than the 10 gal
lons of cream at 28 cents. Now the
IS pounds of butterfat at 33 cents per
pound is $5.28, that wa get for the
same cream that created the same
butter that we got $2.50 for, and the
St. Louis Iron Mountain Railway has
a tariff in effect that they will carry
5 gallons of this cream by baggage for
14 cents to St. Louis, and the express
Company and Railroad Company will
return the cans free of charge.
I am just in receipt of a letter from
the Fox River Butter Company( of St,
Louis. They will pay from one cent
below the Elgin butter quotations to
one cent above for tho butterfat, and
as you know, the Elgin people claim
to make the best butter there is, so in
the summer time when we get an over
production of Cream, you see that we
get a reasonably good price anyway,
as they tell me they didn't pay less
than 25 cents a pound any time last
summer for butterfat. I want to sav
further, then, that we are raising two
calves and feed twe sows that have 15
pigs, on this skim milk, and by, mix
ing a little shorts with it. The sows
are in fine shape and so are the pigs
and calves.
We separate the milk from tmtter '
fat just as soon as it is milked and the
labor is less than one-third of the old
way of making bntter. This convinces
me of what I have urged a long time,
that our farmers here are not utilizj
ing this county for what it is adapted
to. The Iron Mountain railroad could
pick up from 10 to 50 dollars every
day, If the people would turn their at
tention to it, and with large profit to
the farmer. The intention of our
Government, when they created the
National Bank System was for the
farmer producer to get cheap money;
also Col. F. D. Gardener's Farm Bank
idea was under the same principle. So
you can see from what I say,' that this
is Correct, and if any of your readers
doubt it, I will send you the bill of
sale, for you to publish in the paper,
of what we receive for this cream. 1
have figured it out carefully and have
decided, by figures and by practical ex
perience, that anman can take 8600,
lease him a piece of land, buy $400
worth of Jersey cows, and buy his
equipment, such as Creanr Separator,
and cans, one good gentle sow with a
gang of pigs, and 2 to 3 doaen good
hens and he make clear of all expenses
per day, from $1.50 to $2.00, and
trust thut other people along the Iron
Mountain, and back in Reynolds coun
ty, to where we are making the good
road from County Seat to County
Seat, will see it as I do; that this but
terfat can be brought in 10 or 12 miles
in Missouri as it can in Illinois and
other states, and it would look nice to
me, and I think it would to you, Mr
Editor, to see an autotruck pull out of
Centerville, and gather up on this
road from Centerville, to Glover, with
every lady or gentleman that wishes
to go into the dairy business, from
to 20 gallons of cream from each fam
ily, but it would look greater to me
when I saw their returns and see that
every mother or every sister that has
to labor in way of taking care of the
farm. cows, start a little bank account
of their own and see our young men
that are hustling to the mines and
cities, be contented at home, reading
their farm papers, and studying the
history of their stock and see their
bank account crow week by week
This would please me, at least, great
er to see that, than to Bee him striv
ing in the mines and olties and road
ing the great sport news of baseball
and all vices of sin that our country
bovs are more apt to indulge in than
the boys that are raised with it.
