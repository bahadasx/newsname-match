*'I want to tell you what wonderful benefit I have re
ceived from the use of Thedford's Black-Draught," writes
Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky.
"It certainly has no equal for la grippe, bad colds,
liver and stomach troubles. I firmly believe Black-Draught
saved my little girl's life. When she had the measles,
they went in on her, but one good dose of Thedford's
Black-Draught made them break out, and she had no
more trouble. 1 shall never be without
Black
THEDFORD'S
in my home.** For constipation, Indigestion, headrche, dizzi- j
ness, malaria, chills and fever, biliousness, and all similar
ailments, Thedford's Black-Draught has proved itself a safe, ^
reliable, gentle and valuable remedy. *
If you suffer from any of these complaints, try Black- #
Draught It is a medicine of known merit Seventy-five j
years of splendid success proves its value. Good for j
young and old. For sale everywhere. Price 15 oents. ^ ^ g.
I have moved my office to the Natch -
itoches Compress and will be in the
City all of my time now, so will be in
better position than before to care for
all Insurance business intrusted tc me.
Take this occasion to thank my
friends for the nice business which
they have enabled me to build up, and
hoping to add numerous others to that
list of customers, I am yours to serve.
