Concerning Walter
Prize Seed
Rush Hill, Mo., Jan. 26, 1916.
Editor Message, Dear Sir: Your
kind Invitation to write a brief arti
cle for your valuable paper, how I
grow my corn, is very pleasing to me.
I fear, however, that your readers
will be disappointed to learn that
this corn was planted and cultiva
ted in the ordinary manner.
The soil was second year sod,
creek bottoir. I broke the ground
eight inches deep as early as the
ground was dry enough to plow.
When planting time came I worked
and pulverized the ground, first
using a heavy roller, disc and
smoothing harrow. After this the
corn was drilled about fourteen in
ches apart. One-third, however, was
destroyed by grub-worms, so I har
rowed the ground thoroly and plant-

Corn; The Cultivation
ed a second time. The second
planting was totally destroyed by
the worms, so I started to cultivate
the first planting, using a six-shovel
cultivator. This plow was also
used in the second cultivation. The
season being extremely wet I did
not get to cultivate any more, but
managed to lay this corn by, using
a disc cultivator and throwing
medium ridge. Owing to the thin
stand this corn made only 64 bushels
to the acre. The quality, however,
was good. The variety was Bone
County White.
The seed was selected with great
care. Every ear used was a show
ear. The selection of good seed
cannot be practiced with more vis
ible results than in the selection of
pure-bred seed corn.
