People are Behind Him and He
Will Be Returned
With more credit to their local pride
than to their political judgment Mt
Clemens papers are urging Mayor Nank
of that town as a candidate lor con
gress.
Forget it, brethren. Congressman
Cramton will be renominated and re
elected. He will be chosen the year
to succeed himself in congress because
be ought to be. He is a live wire, is
always on the job and doing things, and
the people of the district know it and
appreciate it. He Is independent or
dictation from any source but quick to
exert himself to serve the interests or
the district or a constituent.
He is no trimmer and faces legisla
tive questions without dodging
He has made good on the job. In
his first term he put this district once
again on the map and in his second he
is adding to his reputation.
He early identified himself in Con
gress with the CummiD6-Borah element
of progressive republicans and was one

Round about the cauldron go;
Mathematics we must know.
Let x equal the cold stone,

Drop that in the mystic pan;
Tell me, pray, how old is man?
Double, double, boil and bubble,
Mathematics make us trouble.
Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake.
Eye of nenet and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Biology makes 'em out and jab,
Thirteen hours a week In lab.
Latin, Hreek and German, too,
Fifty pages make a stew.
And to thicken up the mystery.
Take two chapters English History.
Physicp, French or English Lit.,
Spend an hour on each or git.
All night long from six to three,
Study math, and chemistry,
In the hours when you should dream
. Write an English 12-page theme.
Work at night and Sunday, too,
Outside reading you must do.
Next day, when you're on the bunk,
Teacher springs exam you flunk.
Double, double, boil and bubble, -Senior's

Cool it with a Freshmao's blood,
Then the charm is fresh and good.
By the pricking of mr thumbs,
Something wicked thh way comes.

the National Committee the proposed
plan for reform of representation in
National Conventions.
In his lirst term he was chosen by
the Michigan delegation of Republi
cans iu the house to represent them on
the Republican National Congressional
Campaign Committee and was appoint
ed by Chairman Woods as Chairman
or Its Advisory Committee.
In the present Congress he has gain
ed a place on the Committee on Public
Lands, which committee reports to the
house more legislation than any other
committee of the house except one.
Whether the wets or drys are In a
majority in this district is a question,
but there are many who are opposed to
National Prohibition who are not ready
to support a candidate for congress
simply because he is satisfactory to the
brewries. The liquor interests ia this
state will have enough to do this year
Mghting state prohibition without try
ing to dictate the choice of congress
men and other candidates.
On every hand one hears praise of
Cramton's work as congressman, and
there is no reason why the influence of
this district at Washington should be
nullified by starting a new mm. St.
Clair Republican, Jan. 27, 1916.
M. P. Church Re-opened
We are glad to report our church re
opening as a success in every way.
Even the rain did not hinder us from
haying a full house. Our church is
certainly decorated in a way that
pleases everyone, many remarking that
it was more beautiful than when com
pleted, ten years ago.
The choir rendered special anthems
both morning and evening. Rev. E.
L. Morrison and wife were present and
sang several duets, which were ap
preciated by all.
Rev. Saxbee took for his theme in
the morning the words .of Solomon
when he spoke of God filling the tem
ple, The lleaven of Heayens cannot
contain thee, much less this house
which we have built."
In the evening his theme was "The
authority to become the sons of God."
Rev. Bragg gave a report of the ex
pense which was over 9210 in cash, not
saying anything about the many willing
hands which donated their services in
cleaning the old paint and plaster from
the walls. There was money enough
in the treasury to pay all indebtedness,
but an appeal was made for funds and
the people responded liberally, a sum
being raised to the amount of $13(3.00,
which will be used in repairing the
outside of the church in the spring.
In the evening one soul accepted the
Lord, and special services were an
nounced to continue until Thursday
night.
Surely this was a day long to be re
membered by our people.
