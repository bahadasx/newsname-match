Rice, the British ambassador, asked
that the ship bo returned to the Brit
ish owners as a prize recovered under
The Hague convention.
- The Prussian-American treaty un
der which Germany claims the ship
SWjjvides as follows:
, "'-.vessels of war, public and
. ' . . . ..
prtvai.. y both parties, shall carry
freely wlicresoever they please, the
vessels and effects taken from their
enemies without being obliged to
pay any duties, charges or fees to
officers of admiralty, of the customs
or any others; nor shall such prizes
be arrested, searched or put under
legal process when they come to and
enter the ports of the other party,
but may freely be carried out again
at any time by their captors to the
places expressed In their conunis
sions which the commanding officer of
such vessel shall be obliged to show."
The Hague convention provides for
the Internment of the crew aud the
surrender of the ship but state de
partment officials are doubtful that
it can be applied to the case of the
Appam, because tho Prussian-Ameri
can treaty is believed to be biuding,
and because Great Britain signed but
never ratified this particular Hague
convention. ,
,.- London, Feb. 2. The British gov
ernment will hold that the Appam
must'be released under clauses 21 and
22 of The Hague convention of 1907, It
was stated 'today. These provide
that a merchantman cannot be con
verted into an' auxiliary crui3er on
the high sea and that a merchantman
prize can only be taken into a neu
tral port under certain circumstances
of distress, injury or lack of food, and
inai u it ones not i depart wunm a
stipulated time cannot be interne'd
but must be turned over to the origi
nal owners with all ber cargo.
According to the British contention,
under these clauses the prize crew
must be interned.

There is scarcely any fighting en

French tho aggressors. The French
guns also have shelled the town of
Lens.
London, Thursday, Feb. 3. As fur
ther details of the slaughter and de
struction wrought by ' Monday's Zep
pelin raid are made public the offici
al report now gives fifty-nine' as the
number of those killed, and : 101 ;as
that of. the injured insistent de
mands for reprisals are heard In quar'.
ers in which such a policy has hither
to .been depreciated. ; - ! ' :-,
When one considers the fact that
of the counties in which bombs were
dropped three, at least, of the six enu
merated Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Staf
fordshire, Suffolk, Leicestershire, and
Derbyshire contain a considerable
number of manufacturing towns, the
material damage done by the dropping
of 221) bombs was very small in extent
and importance.
As at the time of tho attack on Lon
don in October, when' most of the
bombs which ' might otherwise have
caused great loss cf life dropped in
the middle of broad streets, so, in the
course of Monday's invasion , many
great projectiles fell harmlessly in
fields, gardens and canals. The fact
that it required -approximately two
bombs to Inflict one death or injury is
pointed out as the measure of the fu
tility, from a military point of view,
of this random bombardment. .

DODGE BROTHERS OF DETROIT
What the Dodge Car Has to Offer for
the Season of 1916.
These men aftet years of associa
tion with The Ford Motor company de
eicjed. .o build and market a car to
dotnk futile "Under a thousand dol
lar" class." Their car at once met
with demand absolutely unequaled
by, the demand for any other car in
the world during its first season. The
"Trade" and the public had confi
dence in podge Bothers. The car
when it appeared showed itself to be
tho product of men of experience and
men with a determination to build a
quality car as a foundation for a Jong
lived and permanent motor car busi
ness. V ', - ; " ' '".''..:,'' ';.'..
The" prospective purchasers can see
quality and costly finish and equip
ment at every point In the car. The
record made the past season by
Dodge Cars in Bennington bas proved
the design and mechanical construe
tlon of The Dodge Car to so far put
class that or any of its competitors as
to remove it entirely, from , compari
son with earshot its price," for freedom
from defective and broken parts aud
need of repairs. , The Dodge ; has
proved itself to be a car able to do a
mileage without repairs three to fonr
times as great as ordinary cars of jtu
price. Iu this respect it has placed
itself in a class with cars of two aud
three times its price. -, ; v i !
, It is also with ears of this price
that Dodge finish, equipment, and up
holstering must be compared, as cars
of. the Dodge price, come no where
equalling It in these respects. Every
one knows that a car can be bought
for ?4 40.00. F. O. B. factory that has
all the go and wear and tear there is
in any car. If you spend a few hun
dred dollars "more for a car you Bpentt
it for comfort, quality of finish, style,
and riding qualities. The Dodge
gives you many times the ' most for
your money of these things you want.
The price of The Dodge Car is ?785.00
F. O. B. Detroit. This car is sold in
Bennington by E. W. Williams, The
Bennington Garage? - ; -This
local business Jbouse has now
completed five years of its activity in
Bennington, having sold, in that time
over two hundred motor car3, about
seventy five of which were sold dur
ing tho 1915 season. In the five years
of selling cars hundreds of dollars of
the profits have been returned to the
customers in the form of free service
to the end that they should get entire
Satisfaction from their purchases. A
reputation for adhering absolutely to
facts in representations and advertis
ing and for making good all promises
and claims has been firmly establish
ed.' E.' W. Williams had spent over
twelve years in the motor car busi
ness .before coming to . Bennington,
was thoroughly trained in all its num
erous branches and able to train his
employees. The Bennington 'Garage
has a more efficient service depart
ment than can be' found in most
places. It is constantly, being better
ed and 'money and effort not spared
in this department regardless of the
fact that such eervice as ours can aiot
