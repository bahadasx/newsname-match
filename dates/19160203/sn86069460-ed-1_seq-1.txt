Last week he received an order
for two ewes and one buck from
Sonor Don Manuel Luciaus Diaz,

Of course this was done by ad
vertising, which all wide awake
men, of business, believe in, and
there is really no telling the lim
its to which an ad will go.
These ewes are coming two
years old and the buck coming
one year old, and are beauties.
Mr. Bird, our county demonstra

lighted with them and that his
friends in other climes, when
they see this trio, will send oth
er orders to Crittenden county,
and further extend our refuta

did individuals, each of which
looked liks a picture, by Ameri
can Express to New Orleans,
Saturday the charges that for be
ing $.1.50 each. From there they
take a salt water voyage over
the Gulf of Mexico and, barring
delay or accident, have reached
their destination ere this.

Mith all counties in Western

cash winnings $11.50 as he won
second at the State Fair, he also
won a jersey bull calf at our
County Fair, given by Mr. J. E.
Crider & Co., of Fredonia. He
has 25 bushels of pure Boone

tested and will be graded he will
sell for $2.00 a bushel, and be
sides that the remaining 05 bush
els of his crop of one acre, with
which he will feed a bunch of
hogs this summer. All boys have
the same chance at these prizes
and it will help them on their
education at tho. same time.

BENNETT FERGUSON.
Cupid invaded our town Wed
nesday and claimed two of our
most popular young people, Miss
Anna Imogene Bennett and Mr.
Groce F. Ferguson.
Miss Bennett left for Smith-
land Monday where she was sup
posed to, in a few days enter
High School. Mr. Ferguson
boarded the steamer "Dispatch"
Tuesday and stepped at Smith
land where they were united in
marriage Wednesday A. M. at
10 o'clock at the I.tmeof Mr. and
Mr. J. R. Wells, the latter be
ing the sister of the bride.
Mr. Ferguson had been for the
past two years the devoted ad
mirer of the bride nd fr tiiio
fact l he now of tho wtuuitg
was not an entire rurtiisti to
their host of fiiemh.
The bride is a tall graceful
: blonde, with blue eyes and light
i hnir and is considered a beauty.
.She were a lovely blue silk dross
j which give her a most charming
appearance. She is the second
; daughter of the deceased H. B.
B. Bennett and is a sister-in-law
j of J. R. Wells, of Smithland, one
i of our most .accomplished and
! well-known attorney's at law
; Since her early girlhood she has
lived with her step-mother, Mrs
I f t r f
. ti. b. henneit, who r.a3 gt.va
i her the strictest devotion und
care.
The groom is a son of Mrs. Ida
Ferguson, and is one of the most
prominent young farmers in
Lyon county and has been very
fortunate in winning such an
accomplished young lady for a
wife. He wore a beautifully
tailored suit of blue.
Mrs. Bennett gave a reception
at her home in honor of the bridal
party, Wednesday evening at
seven o'clock, assisted by Mrs.
W. B. Wadlington, the bride's

Louis Brandies Made Justice
-Wilson Astonishes With Hii
Appointment Boston Hebrew.
Washington, Feb. 1. -President
Wilson today selected Louis
D. Brandeis, of Boston, as the
new Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court. The nomination
was sent to the Senate today. ;
There is surprise everywhere in
official circles. He hadn't even
been mentioned for the vacancy.
Brandeis is a lawyer who has
been much in the public life dur
ing the last three years, not only
in legal work, but in the varkwa
movements for social betterment
He is sixty years old, was born
and educated in Louisville, and
later entered Harvard. In 1813
he began practicing law in Bos
ton. He came most notably be
fore the public six years ago
through participation in the BaU
linger-Pinchot investigation of
Congress in which he was coun
sel for the forces who opposed
Secretary Ballinger. He partio
ipated in other notable cases,
and has been in the fore-front of
many important movements, such
as the Zionist movement in the
United States. He is the first
Jew to sit onthebench of the
Supreme Court
A Word lo Our Farmers.
Everyone will admit that car
County Agent Mr. Bird was a
great help tothe Crittenden
county farmers last year. He
can do more this year because he
has become acquainted with our
people, our farms and the needs
of the farms and individual far
mers. We cannot'afford to not employ
Mr. Bird for another year. lie
is on the field and at our service, ,
but I learn that th subscription
for his salary has not been com
pleted. As Mr. Bird will be in
Lexington for the next ten days
attending a farmer's meeting;
why not get busy and complete
this subscription by the time he
returns, so that his salary may
be assured?
I understand that a subscrip
tion paper has been sent to the
secretary of each farmer's club.
Now why can't we finish this
work and rerort what has been
done, not later than Feb. 15th?
I would suggest to those who
are willing to contribute not to
wait to Le called upon, but to
find ?omeor.e who has a raivr
and give him jour subscription.
l ours f,r better farming,
Jas. Alex Hill.
