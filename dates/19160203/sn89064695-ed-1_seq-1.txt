Senator A. J. Gronna.
The subject of this sketch, Sen
ator A. J. Gronna, is a plain,
everyday, level headed man, who
has had ranch experience on the
frontier, and who knows the needs
of Indians almost as well as th^e
of his white constituents in North
Dakota which he looks after with
the utmost care.
Senator Gronna is an approach
able man and easily makes the in
experienced feel at ease whenever
they call on him in his office at
Washington. He has spent much
of his lifetime in Minnesota, and
it is for this reason no doubt that
many Minnesotans call on him,
whenever "they are at Washing
ton, with regard to their mattars.
SENATOR A. J. GRONNA.
The senator is a member of the
Indian committee of the senate,
and for this reason the Chippewa
delegations never fail to call upon
him when they visit Washington,
and he always seems interested in
their matters since many Chippe
was in North Dakota have identi
cal interests with their Minnesota
brcthern.
Senator Gronna was born at
Elkader, Iowa, December 10,
1858 at the age of two years his
parents moved into this state,
where he was brought up on a
farm and educated at public
schools finishing at the Caledonia
Academy.

Justice and Fair Dealing for
every Indian who desires to
become a good Citizen,
Chippewa Delegation Ob
jects To $185,000
Appropriation.
The Chippewa delegation now
at Washington has filed objections
to the appropriation from the
tribal funds of the Chippewas of
Minnesota because the appropria
tions heretofore made have not
been for the use and benefit of the
Indians.
The Indian office asks for an ap
propriation of $185,000 this year
and the delegation opposes this on
the grounds that the money here
tofore appropriated was not ex
pended for the support and civili
zation of the Chippewas but for
other purposes that the appro
priation is also an unlawful diver
sion of tribal funds which the
United States holds in tiust for
the Chippewas.
The report of the Secretary of
the Interior d'lted December 6,
1915, contains a statement of the
moneys expended for the "Sup
port and Civilization" of the Chip
pewas of Minnesota during the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1915,
to be $215,197.40 paid as salaries
during the year to employees, and
$274,573.82 tor the "Support and
Civilization" of the Indians. This
mikes a total of nearly half a
million dollars.
Only a part of this amount was
appropriated by Congress direct.
The balance was expended irom
sources which the report does not

funds of the Indians and how
much, if any, came from the pub
lie treasury. The heading is
"DISBURSED FROM PUBLIC
OR TRUST FUNDS DURING
THE FISCAL YEAR 1915."
During the meeting of the Gen
eral Council of the Chippewas of
Minnesota last June here, the fol
lowing resolution was offered and
adopted by the council: "To urge
Congress to make a thorough and
complete investigation of the man
ner in which Chippewa tribal
funds are being used upon the
Chippewa reservations in Minne-
sota." If the delegation will urge
upon Congress to make the inves
tigation contained in the resolu
tion it is quite probable that such
an investigation would show that
tribal funds are being squandered
even more than the Chippewas are
aware of. It is undisputable that
the Indians did not personally re
ceive any benefit from the funds
expended upon this reservation.
It is true that some of them ob
tained employment from the gov
ernment digging trenches for
water works which was for the
benefit of the employees, and some
of the warehousers received ra
tions, but this could not have ag
gregated the sum of fifteen thous
and dollars.
It is only by a full and complete
investigation that Congress will
learn that som.i of the tribal funds
of the Chippewas of Minnesota are
being used for the payment of per
sons as employees who are not
employed upon any of the Chippe
wa reservations.
The Right Of Nomination
Bill.
The "Right of Nomination Bill"
[was introduced in Congress last
week, and if the wishes of the In
dians are consulted it would be
come a law before the expiration
Defective Page
White Earth, Becker County,
of this session of Congress.
The bill proposes to give Indian
tribes the right to designate by the
vote of a majority of each tribe
who shall be their Indian agents.
The Indian office at Washing
ton, it is learned, is opposed to it
on the grounds that the agents
would be taken completely away
from their jurisdiction. The In
dians throughout the country, it
is further learned, take the posi
tion that it is only in this way that
their troubles can be settled.
The Indian delegations at Wash
ington are making a thorough can
vass of the situation, and if the
R'ght of Nomination Bill cannot
be passed, they are going to make
a strong and united effort to se
cure the passage of a law which
will place them under the charge
of trustees in a manner suggested
by Representative Stephens of
Texas, chairman of the House In
dian committee.
If the Stephens proposition
should be passed by Congress,
this would practically abolish the
Indian office, something, it is be
lieved, Congress wauld not be
adverse to seeing.
Chippewas May BeTurned
Loose.
The House Indian committee at
Washington seems to be decidedly
in favor of turning the Chippewas
of Minnesota loose that they may
rely entirely upon their own efforts
in looking after their interests, at
least so far as those,wju ttfev&ftt
Detent to do so are concerned. It
is not the intention of the com
mittee to treat incompetents in this
way, but Chairman Stephens has
suggested the plan of turning the
Indians over, generally, in charge
of judges of United States district
courts in their respective states,
who shad appoint trustees and
plnce them under bonds to look
after incompetents.
It is also proposed that referees
shall be appointed by the judges
to take testimony as to those who
are competent to look after their
own affairs and those who are in
competent.
Another plan is to classify,
through a commission, all the
Chippewas of Minnesota into cotn
petents and incompetents, and to
immediately turn over to the com
petents their distributive shares of
tribal funds, and give them their
allotments in fee. Either of the
two plans should be acceptable to
the Chippewas, but they should
urge Congress to be permitted to
select one representative upon the
commission otherwise the same
cause of complaint might arise
that has arisen among those who
have been classified by the classifi
cation commission now in the
field, that the superintendents
have too much influence with the
commission, and a very small per
centage of these who are capable
of looking after their own affairs
and protecting their interests have
had all their restrictions raised.
THE TOMAHAWK suggests that in
turnii'g members of the Chippe
wa tribe of Minnesota loose to
look after their own interests, any
law that is passed should provide
that the alienation of allotments,
no matter bow well educated and
competent the allottee may be,
should be made either in the pres
ence of a representative of the
government, or before the judge
of a court of record with at least
two disinterested witnesses pres
ent.

That Commissioner of Indian
Affairs Cato Sells held the Osage
Indian tribal council under guard
in his room, making them take an
oath not to divulge any of the
proceedings that he required them
to sign an agreement to lease val
uable oil lands in Oklahoma to the
Indian Territory Illuminating
Company, and that when they pro
tested he told them their agree
meat, although giving them 500
per cent less than they had been
offered outside, was "sacred as the
Bible," was alleged in a sensation
al brief submitted to the Sanate
Committee on Indian Affairs.
George Albertie, an Indian, rep
resenting the Osage tribal council,
presented the brief. This latest
development in the fight between
the Indians of Oklahoma and the
Indian Bureau to force the tribe
into an agreement which they de
dare is seriously opposed to their
interests came after the commit
tee, two days ago, had heard the
stories of both sides over the reso
lution of Senator Oliver to hold
the proposed Indian gas leases un
til a full investigation of the sub
ject could be made by Congress.
The Indians have received, since
last June, when they met with the
commissioner, an offer from the
AtGe^ean Pipe Lino Company of
M#%*MM#WMMMMMMM*%MMN#WM*^*M^
3 cents a thousand fee*t for theM*
gas at the wells where the leises
approved by the Indian Bureau
provided for less than 1 cent and
the Barnsdall Oil Company, which
is the largest operator iu that field,
has offered them one fifth royalty
on the oil output, where the In
dian Bureau, it is siid, insist they
shall accept only one-sixth.
The.conditions alleged to have
been imposed by the Indian Bureau
are summed up in an agreement
with the tribal council, made June
17, 1915, which the Indians now
say was obtained from the tribal
council without their being allowed
time to study or understand it.
The Indian tribal council de
clares that through the action of
the Indian Bureau they are pro
eluded from entering the open
market for their gas leases, and
that Commissioner Sells insists
that their agreement of June 17,
is binding on them.
They affirm that only they and
Congress have the power to make
leases, and that this power cannot
be delegated to the Indian Bureau.
The controversy grows out of
the efforts of the Indian Bureau to
release the Indian oil and gas lands
in allotments of not more than
4.800 acres each, by auction, in
stead of in the wholesale manner
of the past.

Made.
The Indian office at Washington
and Congressman Elsworth, the
Minnesota representative on the
Indian committee of the Hou*e,
have practically agreed upon the
amendment, in the Indian appro
priation bill now pending before
Congress, to pay the Chippewas
of Minnesota one-fourth of their
fund per capita.
The payment to those who are
regarded as competent to look
after their own interests will be
to them as annuines are usually
paid, but those who are icgarded
us incompetents shall receive ih'ir
per capita shares as individual In
dian moneys are now being paid,
upon the recommendation ot the
Indian agents.
It is estimated that each person
will receive about #148.00.
An effort was made by the
Chippewa delegation from the
General Council nt at Washing
ton to have the payment made per
capita the same as annuities are
usually paid, but the Indian cilice
was oppoed to this on the groin
that many Indiuns would waste
their funds and receive practically
no benefit from them, and the del
egation did not pros the matter
especially as many Indians upon
this reservation have in substance
declared themselves incompetents.
The payment that will be made
is from the principal of the
amount now in the Treasury of the
