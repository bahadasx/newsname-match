MINIMUM WAGE
LAW CONTESTED
BOSTON.—At the hearing before
Supreme Court Judge DeCourcy to
compel laundry proprietors to produce
I books to prove they are paying the
the minimum wage, attorneys for the
defense announces they would te*t
the legality of the law creating the
state minimum wage commission. Dp-
Courcy suggested that this point br
waived for the present, as the United
States supreme court is considering
the Oregon minimum wage law.
Under the Massachusetts act the
decision of the wage commission is
not mandatory.
I LITTLE ROCK, Ark.—The decision
of the United States supreme court
in the Oregon minimum wage law
case will have a bearing on the mini
mum wage law passed by the last
state , legislature. This law provides
for a minimum wage of $1.25 for ex
perienced female workers and $1.00
a day for female workers having six
months' experience. The law was de
clared unconstitutional last ,'summer
by Judge Little of the Fort Smith cir
cuit court and the state officials have
appealed.

DEVOTED TO THE nCIWJSTRIAL, POLITICAL, AND EDUOATIONAL ADVANCEMENT OF THE WORKINO-OLASB
1 understand that you arc thinking
strongly about Joining I'ncle Sam's
army, or navy, or militia, since they
anl Offering such phenomenal induce
ments. Just think of It |18.00 per
month, three square meals a day and
oven embalmed beef and DMAMNI
every now nnd then for a change! Of
course I am just Itching to toll you
not to waste any timp. By all moans
Join. Join, Join, as noon as Ood will
lot you, that Ilia, llf you are so very
anxious to make a darned fool of
yourself.
Well, now. don't get Bore about It —
at least <iuit cursing until you have
read a few more linen. 1 don't blame
you, though, for getting a little Mt
peeved and for asking what business
I have calling you a fool. Nobody
likes to be called a fool, you know,
and it wouldn't be fair to expect that
you would be very much different
from other people. Hut anyway, what
would you think about a man who,
after he had been abused and robbed
of all his money and whatever other
valuables he happened to own, would
be so silly as to get right up and
fight for the very fellow who had
robbed him and abused him? You
would call him a fool, you say. Of
course, I knew you would.
But, 1 hear you say, what has all
this to do with joining the army, or
the navy, or the militia? Have pa
tience just one moment and, mean
while, listen carefully to what I have
to tell you. You might not like me
very well now, but I believe you will
think me half human before I am
through. At least I hope so.
To begin with, I take it for granted
that you are a working man —almost,
that is, a man who would like to
work in order to earn enough to live
decently and honestly and look like
a human being. But just now you
cannot, no matter how hard you try,
find what you are looking for; in
short, 1 take it for granted that you
are one of those thousands of mis
erable, disinherited ones who are
roaming from place to place —friend
less, homeless, hopeless—all over the
United States today. I do this be
cause I know that if you were not one
of those you would not be thinking
so strongly of joining the army or
navy or the militia. Nobody ever
thinks about anything like that ex
cept as a last resort.
But, you are saying now, a little
out of patience, what about the fool
you spoke about a few moments ago?
lam getting to that just now. Hear!
You know what a robber is, of course,
but I will tell you anyway just to
make sure. For, perhaps, my ideas
and yours are not exactly alike, after
all — e ven about robbers. A robber is
one who, somehow, takes something
that belongs to somebody else and
ueses that something for his own spe
cial benefit.
Ah, pshaw, you are now saying,
quite disgusted, that is nothing new

MASSACRE PROBE
The Turkish Ambassador at Berlin is
furiously angry because Dr. Lieb
knecht, the German Socialist, has an
nounced that he will press for an In
vestigation in the German rotehstag
of the Armenian atrocities, according
to advices received here today. T.ieb
knecht intends to ask the Chancellor
whether the German government has
made any request upon Turkey for the
punishment of the murderers.
STRIKE CASES DISMISSED
The indictments against Elizabeth
Gurley Plynn, I'atrick J. Quintan, Car

in the I'aterson, N. J., strike, have
beep dismissed. Miss Flynn was ac
quitted of one charge some time ago
and Pat Quinlau is serving from one
to seven years in Trenton prison on
a similar charge.
As all charges have been dismissed
an effort 'is now being made to have
Qulnlan liberated. A petition of over
100,000 names has already been se

THE
RVERKTT, WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, FEB. 3, 1916.
ARE YOU ONE?
Hy George P. Thompson, Oregon
to me. i knew all that before. Easy,
juat a moment, please. Yon are think
ing about enlisting. Hood and well.
Do as you please. I couldn't keep
you from it If I wanted,', to and I
wouldn't if I could anyway—unless I
could do ii by appealing tosomething
In you we arc in the habit of calling
"common sense." Only,', before you
really make up your mind to put on
khaki, 1 beseech you to study your
I self somewhat carefully.'' Look at
your shoes, your pants, your coat,
your hat. Try also, If possible)' to
find out what makes you want to
back up against every telephone pole
you pass by and scratch yourself on
the back. Take notice also of the
condition of your stomach and then
think about where you slept last night
—and the night before, and the. night
before that, and so on. Next, when
you reach town, determined to find
the recruiting officer as,soon as pos
sible, take good notice of the first
big automobile that comes puffing
around the corner, tooting 1 for YOU
to get out of the way. And when,
tired and hungry as' you ■ are, you
barely Ih^vo dime to step aside a
pace or two, It goes by like a streak
of lightening splashing mud and sand
all over you, try to get a glimpse of
Its occupants. You see smiling, con
tented faces, silk dresses and serge
suits and perhaps a "stove-pipe" or
two. Just note these things and put
them In your memorandum basket for
future reference, '
Now don't lose any time. Hurry as
fast as your tired limbs will permit
to | that, recruiting office. .j You'll have
no trouble in finding it—that part is
well , provided for. . Then, as. you get
near the place you will probably stop.
The flag with all the stars and stripes
looks so "splendid and pictures 'on
Uncle Sam's signs so beautiful that
you really must stop and feast your
eyes. . You feel ashamed of yourself
as you think of your rags and tatters
but you finally summon enough cour
age to start toward the door bent up
on offering yourself to serve Uncle
Sam and the flag through life unto
death.
Hold on, now, just a moment. Give
me a chance to say a few more words
before you go any farther. I solemn
ly promise to not detaiin you long.
Uncle Sam will have you, body and
soul, for the rest of your life or so
long that, what is left of you after he
is through with you will not be worth
mentioning, so you can well afford
to keep him waiting for a few minutes
longer. You remember what I said
about robbers a while back. I.,et us
see what more we can make out of it:
A working man wrote a book a short
time ago and In it among other things
he said that armies and navies are
the boxing gloves of the ruling class.
You know as well as I do, of course,
what is meant by the ruling class, so
I will not insult your intelligence by
HOW RUSSIA FIGHTS FOR
According to information from Co
penhagen, the fate of the exiled S. D.
P. deputies of the Duma is terriible.
They have sent a petition to the gov
ernment from Siberia saying that
they already tor some time do not
receive Iheir per diem allowances and
Hint actual starvation stares them in
the face. Although they are still for
mally members of the Duma, they
have been gradually robbed of all
lheir rights. They are on the same
plane now as common criminals.
MAYOR LUNN GETS IN BAD
George H. Lunn, Socialist mayor of
Schenectady, N. V., has got In bad
with the local and state executive
committee by his appointments.
It appears that lie appointed others
than Socialists to several offices in
the city administration when he
could have appointed Socialists. Lo
cal Schenectady brought charges
against Mayor lainii and the matter
was threshed; out before the Btate
executive committee who upheld the
local's complaint.
The committee, by unanimous vote,
decided to reject the appointments
made by Lunn and requests the may
or to declare the offices vacanl and
appoint party members.
HOLD ON NOW!
"LIBERTY"
hinting that you do not know. Some
very respectable citizens claim that
there Ih DO ruling class in America
or any classes of any kind, to be more
exact. I imagine you are much too
Intelligent to swallow any such non-
HOIIKe.
We agree, then, without any more
ado about what the term "ruling
cIaHH" Htando for just as wo agreed
about what a robber in a while back.
Isn't It really nice to talk when we
both see things bo near alike? It's so
harmonious, you know. But anyway,
Just, for clearness" sake, and, too,
though roughly, to assure ourselves
that our Ideas are, at bottom, as per
fectly in harmony as they appear to
be on the surface, permit me to make
one more statement. Listen:
The term "ruling class" means
those people who somehow have tak
en from those to whom It rightly be
longs, all the riches of this earth and
who are uaing those richeß for their
own special benefit.
Did you Hay that is equivalent to
nulling ull tbe people who belong to
the ruling class* thieves and robbers?
Supposing it is, what, about it? You
are not really disagreeing with me
now, are you, after we have been chat
ting socially for so long? Anyway,
what about that ugly frown on your
face? and why those terrible names
you are muttering between your
teeth? "Socialist?" "Anarchist?" For
Heaven's sake, partner, take it easy.
No matter what you do after you
leave me, please wait a bit longer
before you step across that sidewalk
and through that door. You really
have no idea how it is hurting me to
Bee you go away mad —so I do insist
upon your staying until I have had a
fair chance to explain and, if neces
sary, to apologize.
What was it anyway that made you
fly off the handle so suddenly? Did I
hurt your sense of patriotism and the
love you have for your country? If
so, that is too bad I don't like to
have anyone hurt my feelings, and I
don't want to hurt anybody else's—
that is, if I can help it. So let us
now—you and I —in all earnestness,
look at this a little closer and see if
we can't possibly learn tfi understand
each other a little better.
FOOD FOR THOUGHT
You are a young man, as yet not
thirty years of age. You came from
a good home. You are strong and
healthy and willing to work. You
would far rather work than to beg
or starve. You, you have worked, ev
ery summer and as often every win
ter as you could find something to
do, ever since you left home and be
gan to stand on your own feet. All
told, you have worked at almost ev
erything under the sun that offered
itself or that you knew anything
about. You have labored hundreds of
days—hard—in rain, snow and sun-

POWERFUL PICTURES

Headers of The Northwest Worker
who have seen Comrade Maynard
Shipley's stirring stereoptlcon views
depicting the true meaning of capital
ism will be interested to learn that
he has just had protographed an en
tirely new set of slides for campaign
purposes, dealing with ths evils of
the present system and depicting the
real import of "preparedness" and
war. It has taken three years for
Shipley to find just what he wanted
for use during the present presiden
tial campaign year, and he unhesitat
ingly asserts that the set of pictures
just, completed form the most power
ful argument against the continuance
of the present competitive system
that has ever been presented to any
audience in the form of pictures.
They will be shown at The Forum in
the near future. Comrade Shipley is
open for week-end engagements for a
lecture interpreting these pictures.
Some of them are terrible to behold,
others will provoke roars of laughter,
and some again are included for their
educational value. Terms: Expenses
and a certain number of subscription

PREPAREDNESS
Thieves' so well armed.
Assassins, detectives,
Manhunters
Must always be prepared
Against invasion —
A troublesome necessity
Of their calling.
Houses that shelter
Stolen goods,
Houses that sell
Women's bodies,
Homes of the insane.,
Jails and penitentiaries
Need guns, bars, and guards.
Violence always threatens.
Homes of billionaires,
Where are gathered
In monstrous superfluity
Wealth rended from
Countless broken lives
And homeless paupers—
Need a vast army
To protect them.

GREAT MEETING IN
NORTH YAKIMA
LANDS TEN NEW ONES
North Yak I ma, Wash.,
January 25, 1916.
Northwest Worker:
Comrades. —Emil Herman spoke to
225 people last Sunday afternoon fos
over two hours. We had ten appli
cations for membership to the party
signed up when he left and secured
two more since and the prospects are
good for four or five more by meeting
night.
Com. Herman delivers the goods.
As an organizer I have never seen his
equal and as a teacher I have never
heard scientific Socialism explained
in a more understandable manner.
Many of the strangers who attend
ed the Ulonska-Cope debate came to
this lecture and one man joined the
party who had never heard but two
lectures.
The annual convention of the state
federation of labor was held here last
week and, as usual, put the brakes
on anything progressive this demo
cratic body of workers (?) (those who
took the most active part in the con
vention were in the employ of the
A. F. of L., state federation of labor
or some international union) voted
2 to 1 to defeat a resolution that
called for the election of the officers
by referendum vote of the entire
membership.
Yours for Socialism,
