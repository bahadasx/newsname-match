HIS RESlINATIONJ
Asember ()f The Police
Jury from The Fourth
Ward
jii E5 PUC HIS REASONS
e Other Matters Then ('anne
Before Parish Fathers
On Tuesday
II EKeaton. who for the past Ext
ight years has represented this
ward on the Police Jury, tendered
his rsignation at the regular meet
ig beld Tuesday. Mr. Keaton did
. tcare to discuss his reason for M
ning but when pressed for a
statement said:
"For almost 8 years I have re
psented the citizens of this ward Bul
authe police jury. It is a known Sat
fact that any man who serves on the ing
jury makes a sacrifice to his per- Cit
Ssoalaffairs. For these eight I an
tried to please every citizen of the me
ward, made a big sacrafice to my ne
personal affairs and I do not feel for
that the vote I received in the cal
priaary, m the race for sheriff last rite
week, was the proper endorsement as
that I was entitled to by the citizens ev
of logalusa. I received votes of
aome of the best people in the city, the
*fwhich I am truly grateful, but in
Mview of the total vote I do not se
ti why I should continue to make
ucrafces that are not appreciated. un
You may also state that I will never for
-: in be a candidate for any office th
SO n Washington Parish." en
At the meeting Tuesday the police
jury decided that the cost of bui'd
Sia the bridge at Isabel would be in
the neighborhood of $4500 and they
decided that traffic would not war- de
rant the expenditure and it wa, hE
decided to operate a ferry. so
The question of finance was dis- a
cassed and it was finally decided to m
borrow only enough money to ec
; operate the affairs of the Parish for tc
three months at a time. In this w
manner the interest would be less gi
and if less money was required an
additional amount would be saved. L
SSeveral monthly reports were a
Smade, minor repairs on culverts
were ordered and the batch of claims
were presented.
Secretary Banister was unable to
attend the meeting as he is reported t
to be seriously ill in New Orleans. a

to The much heralded scrap be
