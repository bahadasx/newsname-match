TOPEKA, Kan., Feb. 2.—President

Americans to travel abroad and their

When the president arrived in To

Gov. Arthur Capper said frankly lie

posed great armaments. During his
speecli the president declared that if
Kansas were opposed to preparation

someone had misrepresented the ad-1
ministration's policy and the audience j
jumped to its feet to cheer.
When he left Topeka thousands
roc-ed a farewell.
The text of President Wilson's
speech, in part, follows:
"It is a genuine satisfaction on my
part to find myself in Kansas again.
I feel that every word that your gov
ernor lias said is true about Kansas.
It likes to know what the facts are
and it likes to give them an open and
frank consideration.
"For I have come not to plead a
cause—the cause I would speak for
does not need to be pleaded for—but
because I would assist, if I could, to
clarify judgment and to sweep away
those things irrelevant and untrue
which is likely to cloud the issue of
national defense, if they be not very
candidly spoken about.

situation every day of the year is
critical while this great contest con
tinues in Europe.
"America is a composite nation.
You do not realize it quite so much
in Kansas as it is realized in some
other parts of the Union. So over
whelming a portion of your popula
tion is native-born that you feel your
first consciousness to be of America
and things American, but I imagine
these communities which contain very
large bodies of men whose birth place,
whose memories, whose family con
nections are on the other side of the
sea, in places now swept by the flame
of war, their intimate sympathies
are with some of the places now most
affected by this titanic struggle.
"The majority of them are stead
fast Americans nevertheless. They
deliberately came to America. They
were told that this was a land of lib
erty and of opportunity, as it is.
"And the vast majority of them
have the passion of American liberty
in their hearts.
"Some men of foreign birth iiave
tried to stir up trouble in America,
but, gentlemen, some men ot American
birth have tried to stir up trouble in
America, too. If you were to listen i
to the counsels that are dinned into
my ears in tiie executive office in
Washington, you would find that some
of the most intemperate of them came
from the lips of men who had for
generations together been identified
with America, but who, for the time
lieing, are so carried away by the I
sweep of their sympathies that they !

American tradition and American pol- i

PRIZE SHIP
ON GERMAN
FREE TO LAND
_Tum ,^°^f s 'T C °MF°RT. Va., Feb. 2.
1wo hundredI andfoit.y-five persons,
held prisoners by a German prize crew,
on the former Brit'sh passenger liner,
Appam, were informed tonight that;
they were at liberty to land on Ameri
can soli. More than 200 others, includ
ing the German captors, the captain
and crew of the liner, and certain
passengers, alleged to belong to the
armed forces of Great Britain, will be
held on hoard until the United States
government definitely determines
their status and that of the ship itself.
This arrangement was reached on
orders from Washington after a con
ference between representatives of tiie
German and British governments on
the Old Point wharf with the Norfolk
collector of customs, Norman R. Ham

Tiie captured linor, at ant hor in
Hampton Roads, off Fortress Monroe,

ist, commanding Hie prize crew, still
malntains ful1 authority on board the
liner, but ho is acting under order?
from tiie United States government.
He has agreed to move the ship to
Newport News and hold tier there
pending further developments.
After the conference on .the wharf
the British representative told Collec
tor Hamilton that those aboard who
were free to depart had some uncer
taint.v about their right to go. He pre
vailed upon Mr. Hamilton to return to
the ship and make the same state
ment lie had made at the conference.
The passengers were assembled in
the dining saloon and Sir Edward
Merewother introduced Collector
Hamilton. The latter then explained
that all those aboard were free to
