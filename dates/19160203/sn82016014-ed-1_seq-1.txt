SNIPlCCABLES
Seven From Europe to Amer

German Submarines Did It, Is
British Charge.
BY WlTiBl'R S. FORRKST.
London, Feb. 3. Seven of Europe's
cables to America have been mysteri
ously put out of business. For more
than a month they have been lying at
the bottom of the ocean, temporarily
useless1, while the remaining ones are
overburdened with the great mass of
communications passing daily between
the two continents.
Satisfactory information is not ob
tainable here, but it was rumored to
day that a new type of German sub
marine, equipped for cable cutting,
may be working off Europe's western
coast.
Two French cables, stretching from
Brest for 3.000 miles to Cape Cod and
Miquelan. it was reported, have been
snipped off the French coast. Several
other lines connecting Ireland and
; Newfoundland and Nova Scotia,
over which much of the business be
I tween London and American cities
passes, are reported to have been cut.
The possibility that Europe might
ose of direct cable communication
from America, if the rumors prove to
be well founded, is not remote.

Washington. Feb. 3. Congress and
th diplomatic corps were deeply
stiired today by President Wilson's
speech at Topeka. Kan. Because of
the solemn warning that ''it mav be
necessary to use the force of the
United States to vindicate the rights of
American citizens everywhere to enioy
the protection of internati nal law."
the speech promised to become his
torical. The president's remarks were aimed
at Knsland, warning aciain?t continued
interference with United Slates com
merce as well as at the central powers,
was vlie common acceptation of the
speech among officials.
Ycilcl Fears Seen.
In all quarters today "the Topeka
declaration" was carefully studied.
Some officials saw in it a veiled fear
that serious difficulties may arise with
Knj-vland because of her refusal to let
American food, cotton, clothing and
manufactures pass to neutral ports.
Congressmen- who tmve been vit;or
ouly protesting again!-t Kngland's in
terference wit h cotton shipments,
were elated over, the president's spe
cial reference to this nation's right to
send cotton abroad.
While Mr. Wilson also referred to the
possible use of force in sustaining the
right to travel freely on the high seas,
bearing u pun the submarine dispute
with the Teutonic allies, most of those
analysing the Topeka speech believed
it was aimea at Knsland.
YOU FIRSTGASTON
Germans Extremely Friendly
Towards IT. S.
Insist President Move Next in
Lusitania Case.
BY CARL V. ACKEKMAX.
Berlin, Feb. 3.- President Wilson
must make the next move in the pres
ent Lusitania deadlock. The solution
of the new German-American con
troversy depends upon the decision
the president will make following the
receipt of a full report from Colonel
E. M. House, his confidential agent,
on the. result of his conference with
German officials. .
German officials desire that no in
timation of their attitude be cabled to
the United States until this report is
in President Wilson's hands. But the
United Press learned today that Col
onel House was apprised of a new
and recent change of sentiment in
Germany, regarding relations with
America. Germany, he was told, is
today a solid unit insofar as her for
eign relations are concerned.
Officials and other German leaders
are most earnest in their desire for
American friendship. They are pa
tiently and anxiously awaiting devel
opments, trusting that an agreement
mutually satisfactory is possible.
The Cologne Gazete points out that
there can be an adjustment If good
will exists on both sides. Germany,
the Gazette declares, is showing this
attitude.
ROBBERS BURN STORE?

Pratt, Kan.. Feb. 3. The highest
fire Pratt has ever known started
shortly after 1 o'clock this morning
when the store of the Jett Mercantile

Falling walls also crushed the Oxford

will reach $150,000. The buildings
were covered by insurance.
It is stated that fire was discove-ed
in twelve places when firemen arrived.
The door was found open and it is be
lieved that some one robbed the place
and started the fire. The warning
came first to the telephone office,
when a light on the board showed the
receiver taken from the hook in the
