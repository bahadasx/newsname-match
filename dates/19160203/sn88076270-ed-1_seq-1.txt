Third Annual Williams County Ag
ricultural Convention (alias Short
Course)
This should be the biggest week of
the winter, or of the year, to Wil
liams county. Annually there are
district and state conventions of
teachers, merchants, bankers, profes
sional men, editors,—people in every
line of endeavor, none of which is
of such vital importance to us as agri
culture, none of which offers such a
broad and fascinating field for study.
Through the tireless endeavor of
County Agent Hall and the other
members of the management commit
tee a most practical and interesting
program has been arranged and a
splendid array of leaders and speak
ers has been secured.
Success Depends on People
The vicious grip of winter has
loosened and it is devoutly hoped
that the convention days will be fav
ored with mild weather. The man
agement wishes to impress the fact
that the convention is an all-the
county gathering and earnestly urges
that farmers and their sons and
daughters from every township will,
so far as circumstances make it pos
sible and practical, make strong ef
fort to come and stay as many days
as they can. If you have not been in
the habit of attending such gather
ings let the fact not deter you now,
mike a start, come to this: convention,
you will be interested and repaid. Say
the managers: "You can make this
convention a success by being in at
tendance every day. Everyone should
feel free to ask questions at any time
and express his opinion at the close
of each talk. Discussions are essen
tial to a good meeting."
Held In Court House
The detailed program for the four
days will be found on this page.
Weather conditions having made it
impossible for the contractors to fin
ish the auditorium the convention will
be held in the court room. The who
is who of those secured to lead the
work is given below:

Approbation For
Judge F. E. Flsk
District court adjourned Friday.
Some half dozen cases remained on
the docket but with the consent of all
parties they were put over to the next
term. The jury and others in atten
dance at court were so anxious to go
to their homes on account of the con
tinued extreme weather that the court
decided on adjournment. It is pos
sible that a jury term will be held
in May.
The jurymen paid Judge Fisk a
high compliment by embodying their
appreciation of his constant consider
ation in the following resolution:
Williston, Jan. 28, 1916.
We, the jury empannelled to appear
at the regular December 1915 term
of the District Court, 11th Juicial Dis
trict, at Williston, N. D., desire to ex
... press our appreciation of the constant
courtesy and consideration accorded
them during said term of court, by
His Honor, Frank E. Fisk. judge of
the said district in allowing them at
all times, to return to their home",
and +o attend to such duties as might
require their attention, even when
such non-attendance worked an extra
hardship upon the court.
We fuirther acknowledge his unfail
ing courtesy to us, and each of us, at
all times during the the continuance
of said court, and hereby express our
appreciation therefor,
Signed by the Jury.

RULES FOR SCHOOLS
IN EMERGENCIES
VALUABLE SUGGESTIONS FROM
SUPERINTENDENT IN LETTER
TO TEACHERS
In a letter to all teachers under her
Supt. Anna M. Peterson takes up the
timely subject of rules of action and
drills in emergencies—house fires,
prairie fires, storms. Concerning fire
drills the superintendent says:
"I am enclosing a copy of rules
formulated by the State Fire Marshal.
They should be posted in the school
room and practiced when the weather
permits, according to the 1915 law of
which I am also enclosing a copy to be
posted. In the one-room school,
where the seats have been properly
arranged and the doors swing out
ward, an orderly, quick march upon
an unexpected signal is the only fire
drill necessary."
Regulations For Fire Drill
SIGNAL: One long ring on the
tardy bell.
LEAVING THE BUILDING: Every
student, member of the faculty and
others who may be in the building
when the alarm is given are required
to leave the same, leaving behind all
books, wraps, etc., and make it a point
to leave in the quickest, coolest and
most orderly way possible.
OUTSIDE: Once outside of the
building line up by classes at a dis
tance of twenty feet from the build
ing. Remain orderly and in line. Re
member our school is on exhibition
and the order we observe outside will
indicate our conduct within, to those
who see us only at fire drill.
IN GENERAL: The fire hose on
the racks nthe halls is for emer
gency only. No one is allowed to un
roll or tamper with this or any other
part of the fire aparatus, including
the fire extinguishers.
USING THE FIRE ESCAPE: The
iron stairway in thoroughly reliable
and strong. Do not look down only so
far as\the next step. When we be
become used to them it will not be
necessary to look toward the ground
at all.
ABOVE ALL: Keep your head.
Regard each fire drill as an actual
fire alarm and conduct yourselves ac
cordingly. We expect you to do your
part to give your school honorable
mention when the fire inspector calls
for a fire drill. To realize this each
one must do his part.
Storms
RURAL SCHOOLS: The above
rules can be made to apply to the ru
ral schools with the addition as made
below.
In case of prairie fires or blizzards,
teachers and pupils should remain cool
and collected and under no circum
stances leave the building. In case
of prairie fire, by remaining in the
building, there can be no possible
chance for disaster, as the fire will
have passed by before the building
would be so far consumed as to render
escape impossible. As in the Billings
County prairie fire case, had the
teachers and pupils remained in the
building, which was not even touched
by fire, seven lives would have been
spared from a terrible death, and- in
case of blizzards, remain in the build
ing until help arrives. Insist upon the
School Board complying with Section
3of Chapter 137, Session Laws 1915,
Fire Guards.
Drama That Appeals
To Every Heart
Occasionally some play strikes a
note that rings out clear and true in
the midst of the commonplace and im-
something to say
and he took this means of expression.
"The Shepherd of the Hills,"
Harold Bell Wright's dramatization
of his novel of the same name, is this
kind of a play. Mr. Wright had felt
within his soul the peace and beauty
-•f the hills and he wished to set down
their meaning before him. He mprti
nlay that in olot is compelling, one
that never fails in sincerity. The
neople who move in it are so human
-hat the auditor will pick them out
for like and dislike as if he really
knew them.
"The Shepherd of the Hills" will be
the attraction at the Orpheum Theatre
Saturday, February 5.
Seats can be secured at Kather's.

HOKE FEATURES OF THE WILLISTON
ARHORY-AUDTTORIUH BOND QUESTION
Does Williston need a building such as the new armoiy-audi
torium? Will the building be an asset to the business drawing and
business building attractions of the city For how many purposes
can the building be used and is it adapted to those purposes?
There can scarcely be any question of the great need for
a general purpose auditorium in a city like Williston. It will jnake
it possible to secure and entertain large gatherings of many kinds
and in this way advertise the city and draw business in our direc
tion. The building is admirably planned to serve as a gymnasium
for athletic classes, a convention hall, a playhouse that will prove
acceptable to the largest companies.
The main room of the Auditorium is 50 80 feet with a bal
cony. The actual seating capacity will be 896 and extra seats can
be arranged to accomodate 1,000 without crowding. The stage is
one of the largest in the state, 26 26 feet, 15 feet high, and pro
vided with an ample scene loft. The stage is high so that a per
formance can be seen from any seat in the house. The floor is flat
making it suitable for large dancing parties. ...
The gymnasium room is 35 60 feet with a 16 foot ceiling
and will be fully equipped with athletic apparatus, shower baths,
etc. There will be a swimming pool 17 30 feet and probably
Turkish bath rooms will be put in.
As explained in last week's article the city by lending its
credit in the way of bonds amounting to $13,500.00 can save the
enterprise from $6,570.00 to $8,760.00 in interest. In return, to
make it safe, the city will hold a deed to the property, worth not
less than $30,000.00. Against it will stand a loan from the state
of $5,000 that draws no interest. The bonds will begin to mature
at the end of the eleventh year. ™„Qi
Leased to the Training School Association for an annual
rental sufficient to meet the interest and create a smlangfundto
pay off the bonds the venture is not expected to cost the aty a
single dollar. A careful estimate showa that the building can
*500.00 which alone more than pays the interest.

LOCAL CONTRACTOR
AWARDED WORK
NEW WHITE WAY WILL BE CON
STRUCTED BY E. B. LINK
AT LOWEST FIGURES
At a meeting of the City Commis
sion held last night the contract for
the construction of the white way
lighting system was awarded to E. B.
Link of Williston who had made the
lowest bid on the work. When the
bids of seven contractors were open
ed last week Mr. Link was found to
have made the lowest figures. Mr.
Link's bid of $25,372.00 was in com
pliance with the specifications.
The contract was closed at the
above sum and Mr. Link will give a
bond for the full amount. The work
will begin as early in the spring as
possible and must be finished by July
1, next. The new system will be in
stalled along Main street, Broadway,
First avenue east and First avenue
west and includes 217 lights. Other
lights will be distributed over the
other parts of the city.
The light temporarily installed at
the Williams County State bank cor
ner represents approximately the
style of post and globe to be used.
THE LADIES DID THE HONORS
The second leap year party of the
winter was given Monday evening by
a number of lady dancers of the city
at Odd Fellows Hall. The result was
a delightful time for fortunate gentle
men. The lady escortes carried the
evening through in fine style, calling
for their company in sleighs, taking
them to supper, and taking them
home. It was a very pleasant party
indeed and the men are glad that there
are eleven more months in 1916.
BACK TO RIVER ROUTE
A prominent business man, who
recently returned from Minneapolis,
quotes President Pennington of the
Soo as having told him that the cross
country surveys have all been aban
doned and that the present plan is to
follow the Missouri river at least as
far as the mouth of Tobacco Garden
creek. No definite information was
given as to when building will begin
on this side.—McKenzie County Jour
nal.
AN ERROR CORRECTED
Through inadvertancy and being
misled by the court calendar an error
was made in the issue of January 6
concerning J. P. Mitchell. The charge
against him was mentioned as selling
intoxicating liquors and his sentence
as six months whereas the charge on
which he was convicted was main
taining a gambling place and the pen
alty imposed by the court was 30
days, $25. fine and $45.45 costs with
30 days additional in default of pay
ment.

Zepp Bombs Fall On
121 Noncombatants
London, Feb. 1.—Fifty-four per
sons were killed and 67 injured in last
night's Zeppelin raid over England.
The official statement says bombs
were dropped on a number of towns
and also in the rural districts of
Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincoln
shire and Staffordshire.
Some damage to property was caus
ed. Seven or eight Zeppelins partici
pated in the raid, which evidently was

WISCONSON CITY
The president spoke to an audience
many of whom were of foreign birth.
He declared he knew the men who
came from foreign lands to America
loved liberty and would stand by the
ideals of America.
He appealed to all America to sup
port the government in its national',
defense plans.
"This is Milwaukee's answer," was
the cry as President Wilson came
upon the stage. A tremendous roar
went up from the body of the hall.
For a moment the president seemed*
almost dumbfounded. Mrs. Wilson oc
cupied a box at the left of the hall.
Half an hour before the president
and Mrs. Wilson arrived, the hall was
packed. Eight thousand more jammed,
at the doors, but were kept out.
Thousands Stand in Streets
The streets were lined with thou
sands more in spite of the fact that
it was bitter cold.
It was the greatest ovation the
president has received thus far on his
trip.
It was 2:23 when the executive en
tered the hall. For several minutes
the din of. applause continued. The
audience then joined in singing "Amer

and plainly showing his emotion, the
president opened his address.
No Crisis, He Says
"I want at the outset to remove*
any misapprehension in your minds,"'
said the president. "There is ne

came to confer with you on a matter
which we should confer on in any
event.
"We should see that our house is
set in order. When all the world is

"It has been suggested that the
week of Washington's Birthday be set
aside as "A National Week of Song''
for the purpose of encouraging sing
ing in the school and in the commun

in your school and invite the neigh

also be found in the Meyer's School'

Our national melodies melt into
harmony discordant elements, stir the
hidden depths of feeling for home and'
country, and bind us together as a
nation. Therefore let us do all we
can to foster the love of song through

largest audience of his present trip,
today declared the men who say Amer

of trouble "have shot their bolt."
"I have not supposed that the menr
whose voices seemed to show a threat

said.
