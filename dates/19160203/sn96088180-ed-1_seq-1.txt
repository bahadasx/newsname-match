Acting upon tho ossuruuee that tho

baals of a single year, the committee,
from the Commercial club which has
been In charge of the campaign In
the Grants Pass district met In a
called session this forenoon and ar
ranged, for a renewal of tho campaign
along most energetic lines. When
the commUtoo was soliciting acreage
upon the basis of flvo-year contracts,
many farmers were found who could
' not meet tho long-period condition
which was necessary to gunranteo tho
coming of the factory, and It Is to
got theso men upon the roll of honor
that tho commlttoe will again tnke
off tholr coats and go to work. There
aro several hundred acres In the Im
mediate vicinity of Grants Toss that
can bo secured for planting within

country Is also a fertile field for tho
new campaign. The Hold will be
divided among siib-committoes, just
as It was originally for the long-time
contracts, and a whirlwind campaign
will be entered upon. It Is hoped
that the Grants Pass district can thus
ao Increase its acreage that there can
bo no question of doubt as to where
the factory will be built. There are
also several hundred acres that will
bo made ready for planting Just as
soon the definite location of the
factory is announced, though fow In
this torrltory are taking that attlttido
In the matter, and practically every
available acre will bo signed regard
less of the delay of the announce
ment. 1
In the monntlnie, farmers who wish
to add to tholr acreage or to havo
seed reserved for them, If they have
not already signed, can phone any
member of the old committee and

I more snow and cold Is predicted by

Newport News, Va., Feb. 3. Like
a phantom ship, covered with Ice and
sleet, the German captive vessel Ap-

BUSINESS AT TACQMA A! SEATTLE
ST
Tacoma, Feb. 3. Unlike the sol
diers In Europe, who are always "dig
ging themselves In," citizens of Ta
coma early today began the task ot
digging themselves out.
Snow drifts to the depth of six
feet or more were everywhere In evi
dence. The city was as silent as the dead.
An occasional -automobile could be
seen slipping or sliding through the
snow at a snail's pace.
The snow storm, which raged with
all the violence of & Dakota blizzard
yeeterday, put traction service out of
commission and crippled telephone
and telegraph communication and
transcontinental roads are unable to
get a single train over the Cascades.
No malls are being received from the
east.
Business la almost at a standstill,
owing to the condition of the streets,
although hundreds ot ehovelers are
busy today laboring with the vast
hills of snow.
' Schools were re-opened today, but
the attendance Is expected to be very
light. ,
The enow ceased early last night
but with its cessation the wind rose
and the two-foot mantle that covered
the ground was soon in motion. Drifts
wore plied up everywhere and traction
officials, after battling with the ele
ments tor several hours with snow
plows and gangs of men, Anally threw
up the sponge and admitted them
selves worsted.
A score of cars were off tho tracks
In various parts ot the elty.
Long linos ot early workers
trudged along abandoned street car
tracks from the outlying sections and
others wallowed and floundered
through billows of enow that lny
waist deep on less froquontod streets.
There was no wind this morning and
tho temperature was moderate, with
every Indication of moro snow during
the day.

At this announcement the immense
audience, partly composed of those ot
German descent, made the big hall
ring.
"I am ready," he said, "to make al
lowances on both" sides. I hare tried
to think as tar as possible from the
viewpoint of tho other side, for I
know how my own heart would burn
and my head whirl If I saw my coun

Speaking of the American navy, bo
said that to protect adequately our
coasts. "I think It should be the
greatest In tho world. It should be
unconquerable."
"There Is not a better navy than
ours," he explained, "but It must hare
ships enough, and we are going to
give them enough. It would tear thjs
heart strings of America to be at war
with any other nation. Yet if great

we had to defend ourselves, we would
not be at peace. But no man can lead

Seattle, Feb. 3. Five hundred
street car employes were kept work
ing all of last night and today In an
effort to make headway against the
snow and Ice-locked tracks.
On many lines the attempt was to
clear enough of trackage to get the
marooned cars through to the barns.
Because the cars were Isolated at
various parts of tho city it was prac
tically impossible to make headway
with snow plows.
Many of the cars have been brought
In today, but there were still enough
out to make clearing with snow plows
Impossible.
Many shovel gangs kept the cable

to use salt to keep the slots open.

JOY III GERMANY AT
CAPTURE Of APPAM
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
Berlin, Feb. 3. German capture of
the British liner Appam, Zeppelin
raids against England and Paris, and
renewed activity of German undersea
boats mark the prelude of an aggres
sive new campaign in the air and sea-
Experts suggested today that feats
more startling even than the events
ot the past few days may be on the
'books. , i . !...'..
The Appam capture has aroused
Germany to a high, pitch of enthu
siasm, while the prize crew that
guided the vessel into Norfolk are
hailed on every hand as heroes.
Reports of the Appam capture were
more prominently displayed in the
newspapers than anything incept the
successful Zeppelin attacks against
English manufacturing cities.
Plans for further prosecution of the
Zeppelin raids call . tor . attacking
everything of military or food value
in England as long as the British
policy or starving uorman women and
children continues. " ' !.
At the same time officials have map
ped a strong submarine campaign
and they declare that It will be im
possible to consent to any new regu
lations for submarine warfare while
the starvation blockade persists.
In connection with the aerial pro
gram, it was pointed . out that the
Monday night attack on big English
cities had0 accomplished one of Its
main objects, namely, destruction ot
grain elevators In Liverpool.
Meantime officials In charge of the
new air and sea moves are confident
that they can strike such terror to the
heart of England . and create such
ruin as to cause a relaxation of the
English hunger warfare. ,
