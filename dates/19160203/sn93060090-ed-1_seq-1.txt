The Capitalists say that PoUti
, cal Socialism will lake a way the
rights of the poor.working nun
The reason for them saving this
is, from the fact that it will take
from them their slave trade and
profit system. That is by the
.profit system they make slaves
.of men.
Der readers we wish to say
to you we have never written an
article, on Bible truths, nor we
never will write one, oniy under
the heading of Crpation and For i
tnation althounh there may ap
pear another heading to the
article, and this has been the
case miny times yet every arti
cle is written under our copy
right "Creation and Forma
tion Or The Jew Ana Tho Gen
tile The Sealed Book Onened
And The Word Of Truth Rightly
Divided Which explains All Mys
teries Therein." We will have
an article in next week, headpd
"Choose Ye this Day Whom Ye
Will Serve" which comes under
the beading of Creation and
Formation. We may drop the
big heading but at all times we
Lwrite under its folds because the
government gave us the right to
it.
WHEN WE LOOKED ON THE
PROFILE OF WASHINGTON.

We chanced to walk into a
neighbor's. house in the 90's and
as we seated ourself in an arm
chair we cast our eyes upward
to a picture hanging on the wall.
And our eyes rested on one of
the most honorable pictures and
profiles that we have ever had
the priviledge of looking upon
.except the Lord Christ eating
His last supper here on earth.
And tue picture and profile
now in question, was the profile
of President Washington walk
ing the checkered pavement. In
the Svmbolic Lodtre of Blue Ma
sons. What in emblem of the
checkered life of man, or in oth
er words man upon the checker
ed life of time.
We saw from the picture that

''And when he had opened the
fifth seal I saw under the alter
the souls of them that were slain
for the word nf God, and for the
testimony which they held.
And they cried with a loud
voice saying, now long, U L,oru
holy and true, dost tlu.u not
judge and avenge our blood on
them that dwell on the earth?"
(Rev.fi-9 -10)
1. Who was it ihat cried with
aloud voice?
2. Anil where were they when
they cried with aloud voice?
.'!, And when was it that they
cried oui,.'
4. And who did they cry to?
1. It viasthy souls that had
been slain for the word of God,
and the testimony which they
held. Those saints luu been
slain after Christ was here on
earth.
2. They were under the Alter
that is r.hder Christ, for christ
is the Aher. For God said.
"For bo hath put all things

We are proud to he number
ed with the 2x4's For God sayi-
"And I will give power unto
my two witnesses, and they
shall prophesy a thousand, two
hundered and threescore days,
clothed in sackcloth.
These are the two olive trees,
ami the two candlesticks stand
ing before the God of the earth
And if any man will hurt
them, fire proceeaeth out of
their mouth, and devoureth their
pnemies: and if any man wiil
hurt them, he. must in this
manner bo kilted. -(Rev. iVii 4 5
We are joyously proud of our as
sociations with the two witness
es of uod, they are good, his
twoolive trees are good, aiiu nis
two candlesticks are very good.
Then again He says.
"And I will feed the flock of
slaughter, even you, O poor .f
the flock: And I took unto me
two staves; the one I called
Beauty, and the other I called
Bands; and 1 fed the llocK.
Zeoh. 11-"
His two staves are
i'es friends, and readers ef
the Crsssut we . belong to tbe
2x1 class and we repeat again
that we are proud of it. For they
go to help make up the everlast
ing gospel which is being taugnt .
thru the Cresset in this day
and time. We wish our friends
would come and see us, and
watch us cut curd wood a half
day and how we live.
War of the rich.
Te::t: ' Thou sayest, (buttbey
are but vaiu words,) I have coun
sel and strength for the war.
Now on whom dost thou trust,
that thou rebellesb .against me?M
(2 Kings 18--2Q.)
Here is the kind p ..men who
love war. The same spirit that
rebelled in heaven controle these
men and make them say that we
have strength and council for
the war. This a'l have we con
sidered well, and we can only
say in the language of .me of old:
"Lo, this only have I found,

in this world, should teach us,
punctuality, to walk uprightly
and firmly upon the broad basis
of virtue, and religion, this les
son we learned in tbe modesty of
what our eyes beheld, in the
picture and also taught us to be
ready to give assistance, to our
nntortunate fellow creatures,
who are iu distress. For we
might become in the same need,
and we have. What a drama of
life, it sti 1 clings to us from the
picture of the character of a No
ble Mason,
since thi fall of the church,
up till this present time.
4. The main cry Las been made
to Christ the son of God as he i
has all things under him, and
will rule until he delivers the
kingdom up to the Father, thou
God will be ail and in nil. Some
people say mat when one dies
they sleep until the resurrection
morning, But this is pine hlanl.
proof that h". does not sltep wiih
the molding body until the re
surrection morn. This is a very
wrong idea this would of done
for tbe Gedliies the created peo
pie Before Christ came and
died on the cross, For before
Christ died the. created people
died and went down to silence
and was no .more But when
Christ died he created them a
new and brought them .from the
grave a now creature in him'
This ended their silence, forever.
I f the reader wauts any more
on this ask for more light.

NOTICE!!
We have given yon just a
few of the enod two's spoken
of in the word of God. And now
wo must find a justification in
thcnuniber 4. so please read.
"Daniel spake and said. I saw
in my vision by night, and, be
hold, the four winds of the heav
en strove upon the great sea.
Dan. 7-2
But wc shall not stop here on
the number; 4- Please read.
"And after these things I saw
four angels standing on the
four corners of the earth, hold
ing the four winds of the earth,
that the wind should not Imow
on the earth, nor on the sea.
nor on any tree. Jicv. 7 1
llerois iliq-t angels standing
on the I corners of the earth,
holding the 4 winds of the earth
i.hnan all arniiood. but just one
more proof and that is this-
"Ar.d before the throne there
was a sea of nlass like unto cry
stal' and in the midst of the
throne, and round about the
throne, were four beasts full of
eyes before and behind.
but they have sought out many
inventions.' (hcclc. 29.
And with a clear understand
ing we find that man has invent
ed all manner of weapons of war.
And for this reason wo again,
quote you;
"'A time to rend, and a 'time to
sew ; a time to keep silence, and
a time to speak;
A time to love, and a time to
hate; a time, of war. and a time of
peace.'' Fecle. 3 7-w.)
We must say that this is the
lime for one nation to rend all
that they can from another na
tion. Just like it is in Europe
today. And this cause the time
to speak and tell them that it is
satan that forces war upon the
people and not God, and that
there should be proparednesu for
peace and this peace must come
under the Leadership of God's
eternal Truths. For this reason
we speaK and say to our readers
in the place of going out into the
battlefield equipped with sword
and spear, shot and shell. Let
us put on the whole .armor of
God. Because the senteuce a
gainst an evil work, is not speedi
ly executed. But it will be ex
ecuted iu.cod's own time. And
so it will be with war. It smust
cease to be.
Any party or p-irtitw wishing
to ask questions through this
paper upon any subject, reli
giously o" olherwi-e shall be
treated a a friend. But in no
case "ill 'he Editor allow any
slang or slang phrases g j thru
its coukui s.
And the four beasts had each
of them six wings about him;
and they were full of eyes with
;:.: aod they ie.st not day and
night, saying, Holy, holy, holy
Lord God Almighty, which was.
and is, and is t come. F.sv. 4
