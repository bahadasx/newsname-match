CslAsary B!a!ock Writes.
The following inserestipg let
ter from Missionary Blalock has
Just been received by Mr. George
SherrUl, which, as requested, he
ends us for publication:
Deab Brother Shebr'ill: It
has been some time since I wrote
you or the Beaver Dam church,
and now the end of the year is
near when we hope to get off a
general letter to all our churches
and friends. But I will write a
short letter now and you can
have it published in your county
paper jf you like, and the editor
is willing. '
We have just closed one of the
most interesting Bible classes we
have ever held. The attendance
was above the average and the
interest good throughout the en
tire two weeks. Our next class is
to convene about the 20th of
i February of next year, 1916.
These Bible classes are very im
portant, for our newly-received
converts know but little of their
Bibles, and in order to be able to
stand alone and combat the ma
ny enemies of the truth, they
need above all else to be armed
with the Word of God which is
the sword of the spirit. This time
we studied First Corinthians and
James. It was interesting to note
in the study of First Corinthians
how very much1 alike the troub
les of the Corinthian church and
our recent ones here have been,
the difference being that those in
Corynth were caused by new con
verts from rank heathenism who
were not yet well established in
the truth, while the recent troub
les among us were caused and are
still being fomented by missiona
ries who set themselves up as
spiritual superiors and have come
to this land as missionaries and
leaders of new converts.
There is riothing in the entire
epistle of First Corinthians which
Paul condemns in the way of
schisms and flagrant sins among
the church ..members that is
worse than what has been done
or is being done by this defected
Pentacostal faction here in Tai
An Fu. And one sad thing about
it all is, that by their pious let
ters and spurious reports of mir
acles performed among the Chi
nese, good people at home are
being led astray by them.
1 have had but little time at
home this Autumn have been
traveling aid preaching over a
large section of country and
have been enabled to baptize
many converts.. Though I have
had more of bur own towns to
preach to than I could reach
I have had to visit some of the
places where our work and the
Board work are overlapping and
. and hold special meeting for some
of their evangelists and baptize
native converts. This work of
the Board in this region is car
ried on by the Shontung Bap
tist Chinese Association and is
supported .by; the Chinese Chur
ches of TSast Shontung. it is
largely a self support work such
as our Gospel Mission has been
laboring for ever since we came
to China. Bo in helping these
Chinese brethren I am glad to
feel that I am helping in an effort
af self support and Baptist
Church independence. But their
demands and Entreaties for me
to help them are bringing a bur
den upon me greater than hu
man flesh can bear. They will
need to send Missionaries to look
after this growing work of the
Baptist Shontung Native Asso
ciation, for my own work is en
tirely beyond my power of endu
-ranee and limitations of time.
. But notwithstanding, this, of all
years o my missionary life in
China has been the hardest,

It ment entering our mission) lam

In this moral tillage God culti
vates many flowers seemingly
for their beauty and fragrance,
for, when bathed in soft sunshine,
they buret into flower, then the
Divine hand gathers them from
the earthly fields to be kept in
crystal vases in the deathless
mansions above.
Thus the little children die,
some in the sweet bud, some in
the fullerflowerbut never tooear-
ty to make heaven fairer and
sweeter with their immortal
bloom.
When the Death Angel took
rora their home on Jan. 23, lit
tle Edna E. Bingham, daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Grover Bine-
ham, of Patterson, her short life's
work was done, she being only
seven years, tour montns and
burteen days old. All who knew
her loved her, and life is better,
riper, richer even in this hour of
bereavement than it was, and we
thank God for the light which He
indled and burned with so pure
a flame and taught so sweet a
lesson. Her earthly ministry was
well done, she has helped sancti
fy and lift heavenward our
hearts that break at the sad
words, "farewell Edna." She is
not dead, the child of our affec
tion, but she has gone to that
school where she no longer needs
our protection and Christ him
self doth rule. There is a pair of
ittle hands laid to rest forever
more, tnere are two dimpled
cheeks whose rich blossoming is
o'er. Death has sealed her little
eyes that will no more smile or
weep tiny windows of the soul.
Little Edna is only sleeping.

converts of any previous year

This is true in spite of the fact
that these seven missionaries in
their schismetic Penticostial Ton
gues Movement have done all in
their power to create divisions
and bring ruin to our Baptist
work here. Their conduct, views
and practices taken altogether
make up the biggest fraud I have
ever heard of being palmed off on
the public in the name of mission
work. Notwithstanding this they
claim to be filled with the Holy
Spirit and work wonderful mira
cles on the ladies of the Chinese.
They never seem to be able to
build up a work of theirown, but
depend for their success upon
tearing down and leading astray
the work of other missions. J ust
now they are leaving their own
work when there are dozens of
towns untouched by the Gospel
and going miles across the coun
try to a town where we have
a most prosperous work, for the
sole purpose of creating division
and leading our Christians astray
if possible. It is my purpose to
start to this town day after to
morrow for a protracted meet
ing. I am planning to be out
at this and other towns in our
work till Christmas. Continue
to pray for us.

President Wilson's speaking
tour of the Middle West will a
rouse interest in his plans for na
tional defense in a section of the
country that has displayed
strange indifference to this vital
question, Bryan and Roosevelt
may follow him. Between the
two extremists, the President's
modest recommendations are
likely to commend themselves to
the common sense of the whole
country. Publicity will help rea
sonable preparedness. We must
neither be too cock-sure of out
safety nor fall into a blue funk
and waste billions on a big ar
my and navy that we cannot
need for defense.
Congress is reasonably sure to
do something in spite of Mr.
Bryan's pacificism. The dan-
ger is that Congress will stick to
its flleshpots, the pork . barrel,
and grant money to the forty
eight states of the Union to be
spent by therr at their sweet will
on State militia or national
guards. Most of the money
would be wasted and the coun-
try would have nothing that
could be called an army. The
Federal government has no au
thority to call out State troops
or to order them to any point af
ter they are mobilized, and Con
gress cannot confer or assume
such powers until the Constitu
tion is changed. The Federal
governmentcould not rely solely
on a call for volunteers, though
that worked well in the war with
Spain as far as the number of
enlistments was concerned. If
the individual States are to be
subsidized by Congress to keep
up military organizations we
will have ah army with forty-
eight bosses whose petty jealous
ies could not be assuaged before
a modern war 'would be over.
Each state would have to decide
for itself whether it wanted war,
belore it sent its soldiers out to
defend the country and the flag.
Suppose Congress declared war
on the Teutonic powers, would
all the states approve and call
on their militiamen to volunteer
u n der Federal con trol? The Uni
ted States had little when the
Civil War broke out and would
not be much better off now. Lest
we forget; had a veteran army
from Europe faced the Union
troops at the first battle of Bull
Run, instead of raw levies, little
if any better drilled than the de
fenders of the capital of this
country, the enemy would have
occupied Washington before
nightfall; and every regular ar
my officer in this country will
say so. The Confederates did
not take Washington that day
because they were as disorgani
zed as their foes and lacked ini
tiative. We do not need a vast army
but we must have an efficient
one and behind it we must have
a reserve adequate for defense
for a few weeks with the machin
ery for recruiting and equipping
whatever forces may be needed
to prosecute any war to a suc
cessful conclusion. This is Pres
ident Wilson's" plan. He does
not pose as an authority on mil
itary and naval affairs, and ex
perts can no doubt suggest im
provements, but he is right in
his main idea that the United
States must have better defenses
and that they must be under
Federal control.

Dooghton Objocts to Revenue Stamos.
Washington Dispatch 25.
. Rep. Robert L.Doughton wrote
Chairman Claude Kitchin of the
Ways and Means Committee to
day saying that he would oppose
any revenue measures carrying
the stamp provision of the pres.
ent law. He described it as an
"odious vexation and burden
some." and said the people whom
he represents are tired of it and
want it repealed. Mr. Doughton
believes it possible to raise some
of the necessary revenue by an
increase in the income tax.
His letter to Mr. Kitchin fol
lows: "The question of a revenue bill
is now under consideration by
your committee. I trust you will
not consider it presumptioun on
my part to offer a few sugges
tions. . "In the last congress, owing to
the great faliing off in customs,
caused by the European war, the
Ways and .Means Committer
brought in a bill levying an ex
cise or special stamp tax on cer
tain articles, such as deeds, notes,
telegraph and telephone messa
ges, medicines, etc. This bill was
passed as an emergency measure
and with the understanding that
it was not to continue.
"When the present Congress
met it was found necessary to
continue the same measure tem
porarily, but now, in finding a
general revenue measure I trust
your committee will see both the
wisdom and the justice of provi
ding for the repeal of vhis por
tion of the present law, levying
these special stamp taxes. This
law is odious, vexatious and bur
densome, and the people whom 1
represent are wary under it and
want it repealed. .
"While I am anxious at all
times to be found. in line with our
party, I must say that I will not
again under any circumstances
support a measure carrying the
stamp provision of tho present
law, believing as I do, with my
whole heart, that it is wrong If
additional taxes must be levied
it can be done, in my judgment,
in some manner less burdensome
atid objectionable than by con
tinuing the present system of
stamp taxes and I trust your
committee will take this view of

Jackson ud Lei.
Wo are glad the time has come
when everywhere in the United
States the names of these great
heroes of a cause that was lost
are honored and revered. Each
of them was first and foremost a
Christian, and what they did was
based on the greater fact of what
they were. Robert E. Lee is all
but universally acknowledged by
friend and former foe, and by peo
ple at borne and across the sea,
to be the foremost military gen
ius of America. Stonewall Jack
son as r fighter occupies a posit
ion all his own and he has no ri
val in the annals of American
warfare. ,It is a rather unique
incident that tho birthday of
Jackson is the 21st and of Lee
the 1 9th of January. It is alto
gether appropriate and proper
that our people should have as
sembled, on some day selected
last week, to do honor to the
memory of these great sons of
the South. Taller and taller
they grow in the estimation of
the world as the years come and
go; and we have already said,
their moral grandeur overtops
their military achievements. Lee
although a matchless general,
was the gentlest of men. His
heart was as soft and tender as
a woman's, and his beautiful
character was without a blemish.
Washington had his faults. He
was a man of high temper, and
it is also said of him that be was
none too scrupulous in his finan
cial dealings with his fellows. But
Lee was wholly free from the per
sonal faults and foibles that so
often spoil an otherwise high
character. He was guileless,
transparent, generous, high-minded
and always open, honora
ble and true! He lived in times
of peace or in the storm of. war
above suspicion or reproach.
He not only professed religion
he lived it, and died at peace
withQod and man. Stonewall
Jackson, the turbulent and ter
rific warrior was a man of t h e
deepest spiritual power. He ask
ed and received direction and
wisdom from on high. Not' so gen
tie, so cultured or with the fine
special qualities that marked
Robert E. Lee, Jackson was the
Elijah of the Southern Confeder
acy, feared not the face of man,
but was a humble, trusting, faith
ful follower of the Lordl May we
not take off our hats and bow in
humble reverence today, that the
Lord graciously gave the 3outh
two men so completely good and
so gloriously great?-Charityand
