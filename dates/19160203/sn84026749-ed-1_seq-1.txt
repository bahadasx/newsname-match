MURDER

Near Automobile.
BUFFAU3, Feb. 3. The murder of
Mrs. Agnes M. Telper, wealthy widow
of a local steel manufacturer, and her
son Frederick, will be re-enacted for the
benefit of the county authorities on the
Orchard Park highway today.
John Edward Teiper mill demonstrate
so far as possible, exactly what tran
spired during tho assault upon the au
tomobile party, which he says was com
mitted bv n negro bandit. This pro
ceeding is 1 1 the suggestion of Telper's
counsel, E. It. O'Malley.
The condition of Oruee Telper became
more alarming today and an operation
to relieve pressure on her brain was
rerformed. Yountj Telper slept hut lit
tle during the night. He walked bacK
and forth In hh coll.
For tho llrst time since his mother and
sister were murdered Teiper Is lodged
in a cell. No charge has been placed
against him.
Edward K. O'Malley and ex-Judge
George A. Lewis, his counsel, havo
agreed to permit his detention without
u warrant. Grace Telper. a sister, who
has been unconscious slnco early Mon
day morning shows no slgna of re
gaining sonscioiisness.
Telner has admitted ownership of a
bloodstained pistol found near the
rcene nt the duul murder "Rlng that
ho had purc'iHed It ten d.-vs befoie
the crime Th" weapon, according to
District Attorney Dudley, undoubtedly
was the one used by the mutderer.
There were four empty chambers in
the pistol,
Telper's admission, the district at
torney added, is perhaps the most
startling piece of evidence obtained
since the Inquiry began, though he
claims to have other surprising dis
closures which have convinced the In
vestigators that they are on the right
track.
Telper was tnken to headquarters
after he had attended the funeral of
bis mother nnd brother under guard.
Though morbidly curious crowdn
gathered at the home and filled tho
little chnpcl of the Blessed Sacrament,
where services were held, there was
no lemblanc" of disorder.
Reproductions of rtnger prints on Tel
per's collar nnd the pistol nnd hammer
found near the scene of the murders
have proved unavailable for Identifica
tion purposes.

REPORTED SETTLED
ZURICH, Feb. 3. German
financiers have been assured by
their government that German
American controversies are
about to be settled, according to
dispatches from Frankfort to
day. As a result the German
bourse rallied sharply today.
Ambassadoi Eornstorff rocelved
fiom Ucrlin today a cable telling that
a memorandum from the foreign
office regarding the Lusitanla Is on
the way to him.
The ambassador's messaee was
dattd January 30 (Sunday). He bu
lelves, ho nald. the memorandum re
ferred to will reach here either Fri
day afternoon or Saturday morning.
In either event he will De able to
communicate its cuntents to the State
Department some tjme Saturday.
Tho ambassador was willing today
to forecast tho charactor of the com
ing message from Berlin. Other offi
cials expressed belief that It would ho
one calculated to bring to an end the
long dispute. None would sav defl
nltcly, however, that he expected It
to he drawn in conformity with the
exuet conditions laid down by thM
Government in the last exchnnse be

S O.S. TO
British Ambassador Wants All
Subjects on Board Released
By Germans.
Sir Cecil' Sprlng-Rlce. the British am
bassador, today appealed again to tho
State Deartment for the release of all
British subjects on board the liner Ap
pam. The renewal of the appeal was
made necessarv by the fact that the
German prize crew commander. Lieuten
ant Berge, has refused to permit some
of the Britishers to disembark, despite
tho request of the State Department.
Exactly which of the Englishmen are
being detained and upon what grounds
neither the State Department nor the
British embassy haa been clearly in
formed. There is a general understand
ing, however, that the German com
mander hns set up the claim to hold all
Brltlsr officers and men taken off the
Brttlsi transports that were sunk by
the German raider Moewe, as well as
the crews of British merchant fJ-'ps.
Including the Appam, which resisted
capture.
That the Appam is a war prize is the
official view taken by United States
authorities, according to the State De
partment todav.
Department At Sea.
The State Department is frankly at
sea as to where Its obligations lie. Un
tier a general principle of International
lav, a neutral port cannot bo made a
prison detention camp for a belligerent
Power. But the general principles of
International law. It Is admitted, would
require the United States to refuse asy
lum to the Appam as a prlre of war.
It Is under the special treaties between
the United States and Prussia of 1799
and 1828. that the United States Gov
ernment has about decided that It Is its
duty to permit the German prixe crew
comamnder to sequester the vessel at
Norfolk as a prlre of war.
Under the exceptional provisions of
thepe tratles the German' commander Is
entitled to extraordlnarv privileges not
recognized generally bv International
law. Whether now these samo privi
leges Include tho right to detain British
subjects on the vessel as prisoners of
war is the extremelv knotty and tech
nical question confronting tho depart
ment, Timo and again In the International
correspondence of the United 'States has
the broad principle been enunciated that
a neutral port cannot be nut to tho
war uses and needs of a belligerent
nowet. But even where snocinl treaties
have not existed, exceptions have been
made in the case of specific incidents.
Russian Ship Interned.
Fo- example In 1855, during the

Mystery in Identity of Sea Raid:
er Deepens Liner's Status

NORFOLK, Feb. 3. Confined
as German prisoners of war , for
nineteen days, 244 British civilians
and one American citizen were re
leased today from the liner Appam
now lying at Newport News, the
subject of an international dispatt
as to her status.
Still confined to their state
rooms by their German captors are
the British crew of the Appam
against whose release Lieutenant
Berge, commanding the vessel's
prize crew, has protested on the
ground that they are belligerents,
and twelve other British officers.
OTHER BELLIGERENTS.
Four members of the crow of the Clan
McTavish, Australian meat steamer,
whose gallant battle against the myste
rious sea raider, whose exploits in tho
east Atlantic resulted In the Appam's
capture, are also detained until their
htatus can be determined at Washing
ton. Also on board the Appam are the
twenty-two Germans who navigated the
vessel trom the sccno of its capture off
the. Canary Islands Into Norfolk, ana
twenty Germans who. at the time, were
being transported from West Africa to
England as British prisoners.
Collector of the Port Hamilton has
taken charge of the Appam pending
orders from Washington as to her dis
posal. Before leaving the Appam many of
the passengers, even tho British,

ST. LOUIS, Mo., Feb. 3. In a
stirring speech today President
Wilson told St. Louis that he in
tends the record of his Administra
tion to be one "of genuine neu
trality and not pretended neu
trality." The audience, several thousand
of whom were of German lineage,
applauded the declaration until the
Coliseum rang.
"I am ready to make allowances
for sboth sides," the President said.
"And I have tried to think so far
as is possible, from the point of
view of the othet; side.'
"I know," he added solemnly,
"how my own h,eart would burn
and how ray head would whirl ?f
I saw my country irt danger.'
WANTS BIGGEST NAVY.
In speaking of tho navy, the Presi
dent said that to adequately protect
this country's coast-lines, "I think our
navy should be the greatest in tho
world It should be unconquerable."
The President again nolnted out the
dangers to be encountered In maintain
ing this country's trade "There are
cargoes of wheat, flour, and manufac
tures." he said, "all of which come into
contact with the fires abroad all com
bustibles into which sparks from those.

President Wilson stirred his audience
of 8.000 when ho solemnly warned the
people of Missouri to prepare for the

The address was the final ono ho will
make on his Western trip. At noon
he leaves for Washington, confident
that the people of tho Mlddlo West will
urge their Congressmen to "do some
thing for a national defense within a
month."
The gallery was a regular army or
the "unemployed." President James
Eads How, of the "army." was on hand
on the floor of the hill with a resolu
tion to President Wilson, protesting
against "preparednes,"

"Preparedness never can and never

When the President and Mrs Wilson

them for two minutes. Mrs. AVllson
wore a handsome black gown, and vio

Before the President was Introduced
a chorus of 1.500 voices sang "The Star

"Not only Is It necessary that wo pre

"America will be efficiently nuccess

said. "Advertisers arc coming to realize

He predicted a wonderful future for

"I came into the Middle West to fin
