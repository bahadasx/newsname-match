The quarterly conference of the
L. D. S. Church of the St. Johns
Stake will convene next Saturday
and Sunday.
A. and B. Schuster Company
are preparing to start to build
their big store building by the
first of April. The old building
now standing on the lot, on the
corner of Commercial and Mc
Cormick streets, is being torn
down. Mr. Craig, a mason, of
Holbrook is in town this week
and has been out locating a rock
quarry. We are informed that
the building will be a stone one.
This week a number of enter
prising citizens living in the west
part of townhave gotten togeth
er and are grading the street run
ning east and west from the L.
R. Gibbons home to W. L. Piatt's
residence. This street has been
in need of repairs for a long time
and now the good work has eom
menced and from appearances
now it will soon be one of the
best streets in town.
All the work is being donated
by the people living in the west
part of town. Most all who have
been asked to help on it have re
sponded willingly.
It is a good move and should be
an incentive for others to take up
the good work in other parts of
our city.
. Frank A. Hubbell, of Albuquer
que, a brother of J. Lorenzo Hub
bell of this state, has announced
his candidacy for the republican
nomination for the U. 'S. senate.
He will be a strong candidate
against Senator Catron. While
the game is early many politicians
over in our neighbor state believe
he will win the fight. Coconino

TO THE PUBLIC.
The county board of health will
in the near future demand of St.
Johns residents,, some improve
ments for the benefit of the pub
lic health, and notice will be give
to every householder as to what
will be expected. But I would
suggest that as soon as weather
conditions permit, that all clean
their corrals and out houses, so
that they may not be burdened
when they are requested to im
prove sanitary conditions.
