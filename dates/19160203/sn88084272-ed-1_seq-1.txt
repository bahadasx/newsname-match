500 Illegal Poll Taxes Said

After Maying Investiga

IS El Paso to have an election scan
dal tike Corpus Chrlati and Terre
Haute?
The County and City Democratic clnb
has authorized the statement that there
are 600 Illegal poll taxes issued in El
Paso county to Mexicans, who were not
entitled to the vote because they are
neither American citizens nor met any
of the requirements necessary to be
come American citizens; and that thero
are also between 30 and 40 American
poll tax payers who would not be In
the county sufficiently long In July
to vote though entitled to do so in the
November election.
V. S. Investigation.
The department of justice has begun
an investigation of the reported 500
illegal votes. "I do not know that
any action could be taken or woulJ
ue taKen," said It E. Crawford, assls
J n United States district attorney.
3t the fa?se swearing to2atire the
vote was prompted b? the-fEdividual
poll tax lujpr. If, however. It can be
shown that the Illegal poll taxes were
secured through a conspiracy on the
part of one man or a group of men to
Influence the elections, then the man
or men would be subject to federal
prosecution."
Special Invmtixntlon.
In the absence of the officials of the
department of justice It was not pos
sible to secure a statement Thursday
morning as to how far the Investiga
tion had gone; but before the departure
of Stephen L. Pinckney, chief of the
bureau of lnvestizatinif. left th eitv
Wednesday, be stated that the matter
was being thoroughly gone into and
that If there were developments the
facts would be announced.
Poll Tax n 3Jeal Ticket.
An interesting fact that enters into
the illegal Issuance of the poll tax,
is that many Mexicans along the bor
der have come to look upon the poll
tax as a meal ticket and, before ap
plying for a Job of a public character
draw out their white slips and say: 'I
have my poll tax now give me a job."
In view of this knowledge among them
that there Is more chance for tho man
with a vote than the man without
it is generally conceded that many of
me supposeaiy uiegai pou taxes were
issued through the misrepresentation of
the Mexicans themselves.
Similar at Corpun ChrUtl.
The federal Investigation in Corpus
Chrlsti, whore the g vernment attempt
ed to establish that there was a con
spiracy of citizens to vote Mexicans not
entitled to citizenship, was given con
siderable publicity. Tho Investigation
at that point grew out of the fact that
a number of the elective places were
federal in nature and that there had
been an abuse of the federal power.
The same would hold good on the No
vember election in El Paso' county as
a congressman is to be elected in this
district
SOO Illegal 1'ollx.
In the report ot the County and City
Democratic club. It Is stated that there
are BOO Mexicans who are not entitled
to pay poll tax as they have not es

that the major part of these are from
the county points. It also sets forth
that there are from 30 to 40 American
voters, not entitled to vote in the pri
maries because of brief citizenship In
the county, but entitled to vote in tho
November election.
The total voting strength of the
county, as revised, amounts to SS35 and
the total vote In the county outside

as the Ponga or Moewe, landed here,
but most of them will be transferred to

Appam la Prize of War.
Washington, D. C, Feb. 3. Secre
tary of state Lansing stated today that
there was no question as to the Ap
pam's status as a prize of war, but that
the question of her disposition still In
volved further consideration of The
Hague convention and the Prussian
American treaty. Lieut Berg's refusal
to land British seamen who wero gun
pointers on British merchantmen will
he the subject of further consideration.
The British government, It Is under
stood, will hold that the Appam must
be released under clauses 21 and 22, of
The Hague convention of 1907. These
provide that a merchantman cannot be
converted into an auxiliary cruiser on
the high seas, and that a merchantman
prize can only be taken Into a port of
a neutral power under certain circum
stances of distress, injury or lack of
food, and if sbe does not depart within
a stipulated time, cannot be interned,
but must be turned over to the original
owners with all of her cargo.
According to the British contention,
under these clauses the prize crew must
be interned.

that the Boon In fast was. nenrbv and

The Boon is a fast heafilv armed
cruiser of nearly 10.000 tons, with, more
than 18,000 horsepower. 4M feet long
and with both oil and soal toilers. She

The British empassy denies It has

High School Orchestra
Editor El Paso Herald:
It would really be entirely discourteous and ungrateful cm nu part, as
well as that of the High School orchestra, not to addrp m The Herald a
word of thanks tor all the atvertiinjr that you were kind enough to give
the recent concert in which the High School orchestra appeared jointly with
Skovgaard and the-Metropolitan company of concert singers. To say that
The Herald was the main factor in making the concert the success it proved,
is putting it mildly. The fact of the case is that, without your hejp, the
public would have been nLle to get very little information as to the details
of the performance, and thug the management would have felt rather un
comfortably. Accept then my sincere appreciation for all you have done for us; for
the very successful result of our paid nerald advertisement; but abovenll
for your enthusiastic support of the sjmpuony orchestra project, which,
thanks to your loyal and faithful cooperation, is assuming encouraging pro
portions. .
I trust that you will not fail to lend your aid to tho" latter movement
until if, is .finally established on a firm basis.

Conductor and Manager of High School Oriln-itra.

Exiles From Mexico and

- ' "MEXICAN DESCENT."
The term, "of Mexican descent" In
cludes all who have any Mexican blood
in their veins) It Includes native born
Trxans and Sew Mexicans who are de
scended, no matter bow far back, from
residents of Mexico, even before Texas
became a republic, or New Mexico be
came a part of the United States. Nat
urally the classification Includes ninny
families who would not ordinarily be
thought of ns ot Mexican descent.
It had been thoucht that the propor
tion of white persons of Mexican de
scent wns In fact very much larger
than the census shows. The last Kl
Paso MChool census showed P141 chil
dren of Mexican families. 4022 or other
American families, 297 negroes, 245 of
other nationalities. From this it bait
been concluded that the "Mexican"
population vra about two-thirds the
total, lint the national census Just com
pleted shows conclusively tlint the pro
portion t only n fraction over half the
total. It l believed that the propor
tion of "Mexican" Is less todny than
It has been In past years, and that the
proportion Is not gaining.
