"He arose as if to leave the room.
As he started to pass me he turned
and pushed his hand against my
breast and fired. I was sitting in a
rocking chair and did not ae the gun
:n hia hand. As I ran from the room
I heard another shot That ia the
whole story." Thus did Mrs. Edna
Newberry sum up the tragedy in
which she was seriour.ly wounded and
her husband took hia life In this city
last Friday morning. Mrs. Newberry
is at the hospital recovering from her
wounds and not until Wednesday were
newspapermen admitted to her pres
ence, "Our marriage was a love match"
she said. "I am not only a cousin of
Mr. Newberry but my father was his
grandfather making me his aunt I
was married to him when I waa only
14 years old and we were always hap
py and contented until about three
weeks before the shooting. Then he
began to accuse me of things and I
ceased to care for him.
"The morning of the shooting, after
he returned from breakfast he con
tinued to urge me to return to him.
We did not fuss. I told him we could
not live happily together and said W.
finally, after another refuatl, he arose
and started apparently to leave the
room. I was seated in a rockingchair.
As he came abreast of me he suddenly
turned and pushing his hand close to
my right breast shot I had no sus
picion he was going to do anything of
the kind then, though he had threat
ened to take my life several times bo
fore. "As soon as he shot I jumped to my
feet and fled from the room. As I
passed through the door I heard an
other shot I think it was the one he
killed himself with. He did not shoot
at me but once and did not shoot at
the baby. I do not know what I am
going to do in the future. I have
made no plans. The gun waa one he
bought recently."

TO VOTE ON LIBRARY
MAINTENANCE SOON
At the coming city election the vot
ers of Mexico will be asked to vote
$1200 a year out of the city general
revenue for the maintenance of the
Carnegie' Library. The following
statement from the'library board ex
plains the matters thoroughly and the
matter should carry without a dissent-.
ing vote:
To all who desire the moral and in
tellectual welfare of Mexico at the
city election in April, the Library
Board and 100 friends of the library
will ask the voters of Mexico to vote
to the support of the library a portion
of the city's income.
There will be no increase of taxes.
The voters will be asked to vote how
a portion of the city's income shall
be applied. : f
The Library Board received from
the city funds more than the cost of
the building warranted, as the first
vote set aside a sum based on the ex
pectation of a $20,000 building.
The Board returned to the city $1,-
200 of the sum set aside by the firsfe
vote, made no objections to the vote
doing away with the first appropria
tion, and have invested for furniture,
shelving and fixtures about $1500, so
that the value of your property is a
bout $15,000. In addition to this there
are 5500 books obtained by purchase
and gifts serving 1,500 to 2,000 read
ers, half of them juvenile.
The readers have increased fourfold
in two years, and the future useful
ness of the library depends upon your
good will, and such a portion of the
city's income as will maintain it.
From the earliest times mankind
have recognized the usefulness" of a
library in building up the mental and
material welfare of the people. Our
country's welfare depends on the in
telligence of its citizens. We ask the
good will and help of all to increase
the usefulness of library, that it may
assist in making good citizens of the
youths of today,
We are in honour bound to maintain
this Library .having received the build
ing from Mr. Carnegie, with the clear
understanding that we would support
it ,
This is a call of both duty and honor.

OTIS'
Chicago, 111, F;. l.The United
States has made preparations for im
mediate war, as far as the navy is con
cerned, although foe-, present naval
force is inadequate in size, President
Wilson .declared !at night in an ad
dress before several thousand persona
in the auditorium. i ' t
We mean business," he said, in
speaking of the preparedness plans of
the administration. , ' '
"We have given to, the present fleet
of tjw United Sutes an organization
such as it never had before, I am told
by Admiral Fletcher," the President
said. "And we have made preparation
for immediate war so far as the navy
is concerned." i
The army, the President said, as at
present constituted, "is not large
enough even for the ordinary duties
of peace." '
The President repeated his warn
ings that no time must be lost in
strengthening tho defense of the na
tion. He declared the Government
was doing everything it could for
preparedness. '
"When I see some of my fellow cit
izens spread tinder where the sparks
are falling, I wonder what their ideal
of Americanism ia," the-President
said. . ,
America, the President said, had
been cruelly misjudged by the nations
now at war. J
"They do not feel the conviction of
America that our mission is a mission
of peace, and that lighteousness can
not be maintained jib a standard in
the midst of arms. They do not real
ize that back of all our energy we are
a body of idealists much more ready
to lay down our lives for a thought
than a dollar. "''.'
Rulers, not public opinion, brought
about the present war, Mr. Wilson de
clared. "I thank God there is no man in
uhe United States who has the auth
ority to bring on war without the con
sent of the nation," he said.

the breaking of several levees in the

No loss of life has been reported,
