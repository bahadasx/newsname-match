Has Solved the 16-to-l Puzzle
Sum Lloyd has come to bat with the
solution of the famous "16 to 1" puzzle
that has had thousands guessing since
Its publication In The West Virginian.
Many persisted'in seeking its solu
tion far into many nights?only to de
clare the puzzle impossible of being
solved, and then to try again.
Lloyd, famous maker and solver of
puzles, says the solution of tile "16
to 1" puzzle depends on a folding of
the paper on which the puizle is
drawn.
The puzzle 1b: Draw a continuous
line through each.of tho 16 lines in the
diagram shown, without passing
through any lino more than once.
The solution:' Fold lowe.- section
A so as touring the lower line of
sheet up to line 10-12-14-16. Start
from arrow and trace shore lino 13,
continuing the line over on the folded
end and carry line around to dot be
tween 10 and 12. Hold pencil on dot
and pull folded end down on levi.l with
line, 7-6-5. Draw pecll over short line
11, continue tho line on folded end
over to dot at bottom of short line
15. Pencil goes over line 15 to ilot be
tween 14 and 16. Again push folded
end up level with line 10-12-14-16. Pull
pencil back on folded end and carry
over to point between 4 and 3. Now
pull back folded .end of paper, It hav

ing served Its tricky purpose. We
have now described the short lines

Wi. f
Post Office Inspector C. M. Mensch
of Washington, D. C., aTrlved at the
post office at Rlvesville yesterday and
after a thorough investigation came
to the conclusion that the robbery
was committed by a band of profes
sionals which have been operating In
the towns in this section. Mr. Mensch
thinks that the robberies at Lumber
port and LJttleton post offices were
done by the'same gang.
The RIvesville post office was rob
bed some time Saturday night. .The
robbery was discovered Monday morn
ing and the county authorities sent
the Musgrove .bloodhounds to the
scene, but they were unable to pick
up a scent. The county officers went
to RIvesville at the same time, but
no trace of robbers could be found.
Postoffice Inspector Mensch left
last night for Lumberport and Little
ton. where he will investigate the rob
beries of both postofficee, after which
he will stay in this territory working
en the cases.

(By Associated Press)
BERLIN, > Feb. 3.?According to the
records of the sick Insurance office
of Berlin It appears that the with
drawals of workmen from employment
In shops and factories for war duty
last year were far less numerous than
had beon generally believed. Espe
cially was the reduction slight In the
youngest and the oldest classes of
men subject to military duty. Thus 1
workmen between 17 and 20 years old
represented on January 1, 1915, 16.2 j
per cent, of all the names on the lists,
but by October 1 they had been reduc
ed only to 14.6 per cent; The reduc
tion for the class between 41 and 45
years was from 8.8 to 7.5 per cent
Even for all the classes subject to
military" duly the average reduction
for the nine months was only about 3
per cent. ? It is a remarkable fact that
even now the class of young men be
tween' 21 and 25 is'! larger than variy
other one In the shops and factories
of Berlin, constituting 15.5 per cent
of all the names listed.

SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. 3.?The Pa
cific northwest again today faced the
task of battling with' an almost un
precedented snow storm which has
paralyzed rail communication, disor
ganized city life, held residents In
out lying sections, snow-bound, and
caused many thousands of dollars
damage to buildings which were not
strong enough to withstand the weight
of more than two and a half feet of
snow on their roofs.
With continued cold weather and
more snow In prospect the outlook
is not promising today for early re
sumption of normal conditions. All
roads are tied up by snow In the
mountain passes and railroad officials
have abandoned bope of raising the
blockade until the storm ends. In
Seattle and other cities, street car
lines are completely blocked by snow.
Schools have closed and business Is
practically suspended, awaiting the
end of the storm.
The greatest single losses from
the storm occurred in Seattle where
the dome of St. James'Catholic Cathe
dral collapsed under the weight of
snow yesterday causing damage to
the edifice of $75,000.'

COT THE CHEESE
Now the Right One Wants
the B. & O. To Pay
For It.
One hnudred and seventy-six pounds
of fragrant Rocquefort and cream
cheese was the interesting subject
under discussion in Judge Vincent's
court today.
The case of cheese seems to have
originally been shipped from New York
to Sam.Yquipto, who owned a store
in Bingamon. Bill Yqulnto at Worth
ingtoii took the cheese from the rail
road company's office and sold it.
Sam Yqulnto "is ?now suing' the B.
& O. for the value of the cheese,
which He claims he never received.
Sam Yqulnto is a tall swarthy Nea
politan, and said that1 he is no rela
tion to'Bill Yqulnto, who is short and
heavily built, and says he is a Cala
brian. Som3 of Bill's testimony caused
much laughter In the court room when
he said that each attorney had threat
ened to have him arrested if he (the
attorney) lost the case. Bill's efTort3
to please them both resulted in his
downfall and he appeared greatly re
lieved when he received permission
to leave the witness stand.
During the examination of Bill the
moon passed across the face of the
sun and the flight from the heavens
was shut off from the <!ourt room. The
witness for the railroad company was
then called and the sunlight returned
to the court room. This witness start
ed to make a speech in answer to one
qestion, but was stopped by. tho Court
before his address gained much mo
mentum. On? person in the court room,
however, missed all the diversion, and
the eclipse of the sun as well; this
individual who, sitting comfortably
in a chair by the door, slept noisily
throughout the morning.
H. S. Lively was the attorney for
the B. ft'O. while frank Amos repre
sented the plaintiff. ,
The jury in the case of the City
of Mannington vs. W. C. Johnson waB
composed of the following men: Sam
uel W. Linn,' Fletcher Piggott, Harry
Morgan, J. W. Provance, Chappy Nor
rls John C. Jacobs, Charles W. Rob
inson, William O. Bailey, ,M.. W. Nay,
Alph Curry, Walter Holbert and M.
L. Davison.
This Jury returned a verdict early
In the. morning la which they found
the defendant guilty, as charged in
the warrant issued by the Mannington
authorities. This decision upholds the
power of the Mannington municipal
authorities to enforce ordinances
which do not conflict' with the state
constitution.'
