in Question.
DISPOSITION A PUZZLE

essaryPassengers of
Boat Landed.
Washington, Feb. 3 Secretary Lan
sing stated today that there was no
Question as to the Appam's status as
i prize but, that the question of her
disposition still involved further con
jideration of The Hague convention
mi the Prussian-American treaty.
Lieutenant Berge's refusal to land
British seamen who were gun pointers
on British merchantmen will be the
subject of further consideration.
245 Given .Freedom.
Newport News, Va., Feb. 3. With
ier German prize commander on the
bridge, the British liner Appam moved
up from Old Point early today and
anchored off this port to discharge
the 245 persons on board given liber
ty to land in the United States.
"We are treating her as an English
ship which has put into an American
port flying the German naval ' ensign
ind under charge of a man who says
he is an officer of the German navy"
it Collector Hamilton's explanation of
the present attitude of the United
States.
Some of those who were passengers
on the Appam when she was captured
dt the German raider prepared to
land in Newport News but most of
them will be transferred with the
crews of other captured British ves
lels to Norfolk, there to board a
steamer to New York on their way to
England.
Sir Edward Meriwether and other
British colonial officers with large
Quantities of baggage have arranged
to place their property in customs
bond here and proceed directly to New
Tork to take the first available ship
for home.
200 Held On Board.
Lieutenant Berge still maintains his
determination to permit no one on
board the liner except those who have
official business. He is holding more
than 200 people aboard, including his
own prize crew of 22 men, some
twenty Germans who were prisoners
of war on the Appam, Captain Harri
mh and the entire crew of 155 of the
Appam and 12 of her passengers whom
he claims belong to the" British army
or navy.
Until the Washington government

Prince von Hatzfeldt, counsellor of

ad Captain Gaunt, the British naval
Ktache, reached here from Old Point

The prince is urging his claim that
to Appam is a prize of war, entitled
Irter an old Prussian-American

CITIZENS TELL OF
RAID BYZEPPELIN
London, Feb. 3, (10 a. m.) The tes
timony of a resident of a seacoast vil
lage In Norfolk during Monday's Zep
pelin raid Is given as follows in the
Manchester Guardian:
"About 5 o'clock In the evening I
heard a noise in the sky above my cot
tage and saw a Zeppelin coming down
rather slowly at a steep angle. It was
of a grayish brown color, li ks a rat.
All the people of the village came out
to see the airship, which, after a cir
cular movement, along the coast,
dripped bombs near some farm build
ings In a field and then made off. It
was over our neighborhood altogether
for about three-quarters of an hour
and seemed unable to find its course.
A witness who saw a Zeppelin over
London in the last raid, says that the
present one seemed twice as large."
Lord Northclife's newspapers con
tinue a vigorous campaign for better
protection of Great Britain against
Zeppelin attacks.
The Daily Mail declares that "every
great town should have a constant pa
trol of aeroplanes. It is useless to
think of aeroplanes in tens or twen
ties. We must have them in thou
sands. We want fast, high-power ma
chines carrying strong guns, to meet
the Zeppelins on superior terms aloft.
To beat Germany we must give her so
much to do on her soil that she will
have no time for raiding our territory."
Industrial Hospital Opened.
Des Moines, Iowa, Feb. 3. The new
Iowa miners' and industrial hospital
was opened for patients here today.
Seven thousand miners of .northern
Iowa will contribute 50 cents a month
to the hospital and in return will re
ceive hospital care for themselves and
families. A hospital for southern
Iowa miners is located at Albia.

AERO ATTACK ON
GREEK CITY PUTS
PEOPLE IN PANIC
Salonikl, Feb. 3, (via Paris, 4:55 a.
m.) Details of the Zeppelin raid over
Saloniki Tuesday, which resulted in
nine deaths and injury to a score of
persons, became public today. Bombs
weighing 100 pounds were rained down
from a height of 2,000 feet.
The Zeppelin, after making a wide
i detour of the city, began its operations
by dropping five bombs which fell into
the sea. Warships opened fire on It,
but after 14 shots, were obliged to
cease, for fear of wounding the pop
ulation which filled the streets.
The raiders missed the next target,
but tore a woman to pieces and wound
ed a small boy. Another bomb set fire
to warehouses filled with fats, oils,
benzine and sugar. The buildings
flared up like a torch and the popula
tion became wildly excited. A com
pany of French gendarmes and a picket
of Zouaves restored order and brought
a volunteer Are brigade with hand
pumps through the mob.
Meanwhile the Zeppelin continued to
rain down Its missiles of destruction,
one of which demolished the mosque
of Pussof Pasha, killing three and in
juring 11 Greek refugees from Asia
Minor who were sheltered in it. An
other bomb crashed the roof of a house,
killing five persons. Flames from the
blazing warehoues lit up the harbor
with a red glow.
Fast aeroplanes rose in pursuit of
the Zeppelin, while British, French,
Italian and Russian sailors operated
a fire boat at a wharf and poured tor
rents of water on the fire, preventing it
from spreading to surrounding build
ings. DATE FOR DEMOS

Creston, A. A. Balluff of Davenport
and H. H. Crenshaw of Adel. The
members said today that the date will
not be set at once.
Although it met especially for that
purpose, the conference failed to
select a delegate from the Seventh dis
trict to the St. Louis convention.
Seven men were talked of informally
for the gubernatorial nomination.

THAN IS PAINTED
Berlin, Feb. 3, (via London, 10:37 a.
m.) The darkest pictures drawn of
pestilence in Poland have failed to
portray the extent of misery of the
war sufferers there, it was said to
day by two Americans who have made
a personal investigation. They are
Frederick C. Walcott, European repre
sentative of the Rockefeller founda
tion, and Casper Whitney of the Amer
ican commission for relief in Belgium.
They have just returned from a fort
night's trip through Poland for inves
tigation of the need of relief.
Mr. Whitney and Mr. Walcott say
there is virtually no fool left except
DOtatoes and a nmnH amnunt nt fl,,-
j Little fuel remains. Typhus and other
au.eases prevail.
Thousands of persons whose homes
were destroyed during the Russian re
treat are without shelter. Thirty per
cent of the population is absolutely
dependent on relief.
The trip included visits to Warsaw,
Vilna, Kovno and points eastward up
to the fighting line. Everywhere was
encountered the urgent need for relief.
The urban population suffer , par
ticularly from lack of fuel and the in
habitants or rural districts from lack
of shelter. Countless villages were
burned by the Russians and the inhab
itants in many cases are living in
dugouts. Forty thousand persons who
sifted back through the Russian lines
are in concentration camps. Little
livestock Is left and accordingly there
is no meat or fat food for the people.
The fact that they are living almost
exclusively on potatoes has resulted
in stomach diseases.
Black typhus hag broken
I are now 30 cases daily in Warsaw. The
j general death rate in Poland has risen
j from 19 to 30 per 1,000.

fidential Matter of United

crets May Court Martial
the Men in Charge.
San Francisco, Feb. 3. A book con
taining the secret code of the United
States navy has been lost from the
torpedo boat destroyer Hull, and, ac
cording to advices received today, the
navy department has ordered the court
martial of Lieutenant Herbert A.
Jones, commander of the reserve tor
pedo flotilla and of the Hull, and of
Ensign Robert D. Kirkpatrick, execu
tive officer, in whose joint possession
the book was. If the book cannot be
found, or its destruction, unread by
outsiders, absolutely demonstrated, it
may be necessary, it was said by naval
officers here, to provide a new system
of secret communication for the navy.
Officials Are Worried.
Washington, Feb. 3. Naval officials
frankly admit they are alarmed at the
mysterious disappearance of the bat
tle signal book from the destroyer
Hull of the Pacific fleet.
Admiral Winslow today reported
that all efforts to find the highly con
fidential code have been unavailing
.and., jiavy officers -said that it prob
ably would at. once be replaced by-another
to make useless the one which
has disappeared and which they admit
they fear may fall into the hands of
some foreign government. i
Contains War Code.
The battle signal book contains the
secret code used in war and in battle
practice in times of peace. The copy
on the Hull was in possession of Lieu
tenant H. A. Jones, commander oij the
Pacific reserve torpedo flotilla, and
Ensign Robert D. Kirkpatrick. Both
officers have been court martialed.
Naval officers express some satis
faction that the battle signal book and
not the secret code which is used when
ships in foreign waters are communi
cating with home, is the one which
has disappeared. This latter code is
recognized among nation as the best
of its kind in the world and would be
difficult to replace.

HEIR TO THRONE
SLAIN, IS CLAIM
OF CHERIF PASHA
Paris, Feb. 3, (6:00 a. m.) "Yussof
Izzedin, whatever may be said, was
assassinated in his suite, by order of
the committee of Union and Progress,"
said Cherif Pasha, who, with Prince
Sabah Edin, directs the personal move
ment of the Turkish opposition, to the
Matin. "Lately Yussof had revolted
against the dictatorship of the Young
Turks. He became dangerous and he
I has been removed. His successor and
cousin, Vahid Edin, is even more hos
tile to the Young Turk than was Yus
sof. I should not like to make predic
tion regarding the length of his life."
A dispatch from Constantinople to
Reuter's Telegram company dated Feb.
2, announced the report that Yussof
Izzedin, heir apparent to the Turkish
throne, had committed suicide. Later
j , . , , .
de atls supplied from the same source
said the prince took his life by open
ing a vein in his left arm, that a state
ment declaring he had met his death
by suicide was signed by all the prin
cipal doctors in . Constantinpole and
that the prince was buried at Stamboul
on the day following his death.
Yussof Izzedin, who was born at
Constantinople, Oct. 9 1857 was a first
cousin of the present sultan Vahid
heir apparent, was born at Constant!
nople Jan. 12, 1881, and is the brother
of the present sultan.
MUNDAY IS FREED
ON APPEAL WRIT
Charles B. Munday, convicted of con
spiracy in connection with the wreck-
jing ot me L.a sane street Trust ana
Savings bank, is out of jail again and
i back in Chicago to look after his busi
I ness interests. He served five days of
the five year penitentiary sentence
given him in Morris Hast Saturday-byr;
Judge Samuel C. Stough, before whom
he was tried and convicted several
months ago.
, Munday secured his release yester
' day when the appellate court, sitting
! at Ottawa, granted him a writ of su
! persedeas and directed that he be set
at liberty on bonds of $15,000. He and
: his lawyers secured as bondsmen Rich
ard Curran and Richard Curran Jr.,
j signers of his bonds while his trial was
pending. Munday left the Grundy
! county jail at Morris and came to
j Chicago.
I It is not expected that Munday's
appeal will be reached until the Octo
ber term. Even if the verdict in the
circuit court is sustained, it probably
will be two years before Munday will
begin actually to serve the sentence
I imposed upon him, as his lawyers have
announced that they will fight ti e
case to the United States supreme
court.
Another delay in the trial of Wil
liam Lorimer, also charged with con
spiracy in connection with the La
Salle Street bank, is expected when
the case is called again before Judge
Dever on Feb. 14, because of another
case Judge Dever is trying.

POPE'S ACTION ON
PEACE A QUESTION
Rome, Feb. 3. The question as to
whether the pope will be authorized to
send delegates to the peace confer-
ence which Is effpected to be held at
the conclusion of the war is raised by
Count Soderini, a member of the Ital
ian chamber of deputies, to whom Pope

and intelligent, naturally seeks a solu

ently of foreign intervention. His par
ticipation, through delegates, in the
prospective peace conference as the
greatest spiritual power in existence,
would exercise an immense moral in

questions regarding Poland, Belgium,
Serbia and Armenia."
MAN WHO SHOT WIFE

LeMars. ..Iowa. -Feb, 3. Dr. J. L.
Reeves, who shot his wife last March
and who yesterday pleaded guilty and
was sentenced to one year in the state
penitentiary, probably will be taken
to Fort Madison last this week.
Mrs. Reeves recovered from her
wounds and has been living with her
husband again. Dr. Reeves has been a
practicing physician here for 20 years.
THE WAR TODAY
London apparently is expecting
a new move soon by the Germans
in northern France and Flanders.
Press comment indicates a belief
that an offensive movement on a
large scale is in course of prep
aration, the Germans expecting by
the use ,of masses of artillery and
Infantry to blast a way to Calais
on the English channel.
Great distress in Poland Is re
ported by representatives of Amer
ican relief organizations who have
reached Berlin. The suffering is
particularly from lack of shelter
and fuel, while typhus and other
diseases are prevalent. It is de
clared that 30 per cent of the peo
pie are dependent upon relief.
The fighting 'on the European
war fronts is chiefly artillery en
gagements without noteworthy
acliievements.
German air raids on England
and those of the Austrian on
Saloniki are still of absorbing in
terest, and British papers are
urging the government to greatly
increase its output of aeroplanes
in order to protect the country
against such attacks.
In the Champagne district of
France, the French have been the
aggressors in an artillery attack.
On the Russian front the Ger
mans claim to have defeated a
strong force of Russians between
the Stoohod and Stjr rivers, while
the Austrians report the with
drawal of the Russians from
their advanced trenches near
Usoieozk, in East Galicia.
In the Suuana valley both the
Austrians and Italians claim vic
tory in an infantry engagement.
Reports from Athens say that
the concentration of large num
ber of Germans, Bulgarians and
Turks along the Greek frontier Is
taken to mean that the Teutonic
allies intend soon to attiwk Sa
loniki. The British report says they
are continuing to make gains
against the Germans in the cap
ture of tonus and military posi
tions in east and west Africa.
Indications are that the state
department at Washington will
hold that the steamer Appam
broutrht into Hampton Roads
Tuesday by a German prize crew
is a German prize of war and be
longs to Germany. The point to
be decided Is whether the Appam
shall remain in the possession of
the prize crew under the terms of
the Prussian-American treaty, or
be returned to her British owners
under the Hague convention.

TALKS AT BREAKFAST
Is Guest of Business Men's
League at Formal Gath- ,
ering in Morning.
St. Louis, Feb. 3. President Wilson
today told an audience of 15,000 which
swayed with a tumult of cheering at
his feet, that the United States should
have the greatest navy jn the world.
"I believe the navy of the United
States should be unconquerable," he
said. "The greatest in the world."
The president declared that the sub
marine commanders abroad have in
structions which for the most part
conform with the international law,
but that the act of one commander
might set the world afire, including
America.
"On the ocean there are hundreds of
cargoes of American goods," he said,
"cotton, grain and all the bountiful
supplies America is sending out to the
world and any one of these cargoes,
any one of these ships may be the
point of contact that will bring Amer
ica into the war."
United States Really Neutral.
For the first time during the tour the
president told of how one set of bel
ligerents was cut off from the world.
He said that kept the United States
from helping them ag.it would like. Ha
made the statement In trying to short
that the United States was really neu
tral. St. Louis, Mo., Feb. 3. President
Wilson reached here today for the last
speech of his middle western tour.
The president was met by a commit
tee from the Business Men's league,
who escorted him to the hotel, where
he addressed the league briefly at a
formal breakfast. A platoon of mount
ed police swung into line at the rear.
A big and noisy crowd gave him an
effusive greeting at the station. The
day was clear and cold but the presi
dent waved aside the closed car await
ing him and made the short ride in an
open car almost hidden by red, white
and blue bunting. Mrs. Wilson sat be
side him. Scattering crowds applaud
ed enthusiastically as the president's
car passed.
After the breakfast address, the
president spoke to a crowd of about
fifteen thousand in the Coliseum.
Is Made Half Holiday.
An hour before the time set for the
president to speak, the hall was crowd
ed and the Jam of those outside ex
tended several blocks. The crowd at
the doors choked the streets. Many
thousands were turned away.
Five hundred policemen and 300 fire
men kept the crowd inside in order.
City employes had a half holiday and
all the schools were dismissed for the
day. A school chorus of 1,500 tucked
away in a corner, sang national airs.
As the president entered the crowd
cheered wildly. The band stilled the
applause with the strains of "The
Star Spangled Banner." The words of
i the song came from the big chorus and
the audience caught th air. The whole
gathered, with countless small flags
fluttering, stood and sang, the presi
dent joining in.
Found What He Sought.
The president opened with the state
ment that he had "come seeking some
thing in the middle west and found It."
He said he had been told the middle
west was against preparedness but did
not believe it.
"I know the people of the middl
west are just as patriotic as the rest
of the nation," he said.
"What is the situation? The situa-

STORM IN NORTHWEST
IS STILL ON RAMPAGE
Portland, Ore., Feb. 3. Portland and
a large part of Oregon continued to
day in the paralyzing grip of the worst
storm in their history. Sleet and
snow driven by high winds had cut oft
all railroad communication east and
severed wire communication on all
sides, save intermittent telegraph ser
vice to Spokane. Business remained
paralyzed and city traffic at a stand
still. Continued cold and snow was
forecast.
For 48 hours sleet has fallen, driven
by a fierce wind. Thousands of trees
have bent and broken under their
