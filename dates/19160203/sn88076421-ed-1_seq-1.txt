MRS. FRAHZ HERZK
MES DADO
FORMER TA8KER RESIDENT
SUCCUMBS TO PNEUMONIA AT
HOME OF DAUGHTER IN BON-
NERS FERRY, IDAHO.
The following, taken from the Her­
ald, published at Bonners Ferry, Ida.,
tells ol the death of former well be
~lc\ed resident of Taskcr, N. D.:
Mrs. Franz Herzig passed away
Monday evening at the home of her
daughter, Mrs. J. D. Riley, following
an attack of the la grippe wtiich de
eloped into pneumonia.
The funeral service" were held at
St. Ann's Catholic church yesterday
morning and were conducted by Rev.
Fr. Kelly. The services were attend­
ed ty a large company of friends and
relatives of the deceased. Cut flowers
and floral designs were laid high on
the }.Itar and about the bier, the tok­
ens of love and respect for a woman
who had lived a life of kindliness and
self sacrifice for her family and her
friends.
The burial services will .be held at
two o'clock this afternoon on account
of snow bound trains delaying the ar­
rival of relatives of the deceased.
The deceased was born in Austria
and with her husband came to the
United States some 25 years ago. She
was over 66 years old and had been
married some 42 years. With her
family she lived in the middle west
states until about two years ago when
she took up her home here with her
husband.
The deceased is the mother of seven
children, six of whom survive her and
with their father mourn her demise.
The deceased's daughter died in Spo­
kane a couple of years ago. Her hus­
band, William Snyder, arrived here
yesterday to attend the burial servi­
ces. Rudolph Heriig is on his honey­
moon trip and his relatives have been
unable to locate him to tell of his
mother's death. Louis H. Herzig, of
Bowman, N. D., the oldest son of the
deceased, Frank Herzig, of Naples,
Idaho Carl Herzig, of Minot, N. D.
ana Albert Herzig, of Provost, Alber­
ta, are here to attend their mother's
burial.
Mrs. Herzig was a devoted Chris
ti«j^ woman, zealous in looking .after
the, comforts of others and always
'"WtdyHo do a kind act or speak a
pleasant word. Although of a retir­
ing disposition she enjoyed a large ac­
quaintance in this city, all of whom
will miss her. The mourning relatives
have the sympathy of the entire com­
munity in their sad bereavement.
Will Marry at High Noon.
Invitations have been received to
the wedding of Miss Erma Alice
Jones, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. R.
W. Jones of this city and Mr. Day
Okes, of Minneapolis, which will oc­
cur at high noon, Wednesday, Feb. 9,
at the First Presbyterian church
this city. They will be at home after
March 25, at The Plaza, Minneapolis.
Miss Jones has lived in Minot all
her life. She is an unusually attrac­
tive young woman, a vocalist of rare
ability and no Minot young woman is
more popular. .The man of her choice
is a prominent young contractor. As­
sociated with his father, he installed
the street paving in this city several
years a^o and it was while here that
he met Miss Jones. The Independent
joins their many friends in extending
best wishes in advance.
Great Northern Short of Water.
The Great Northern has not been in
such shape during the past thirty
years as during the present time.
There are but two water tanks work­
ing between Minot and Williston.
There is no water in the reservoir at
Des Lacs. Tagus is short and there is
little water at Stanley. There is plen­
ty of water at White Earth and
Springbrook. Each train carries a
water car. The motive power is in
bad shape for the company never an­
ticipated a year such as this. Busi­
ness has been exceedingly heavy, as
the heaviest grain crop in the history
of the northwest is being moved. The
water condition is more serious than
that of the snow.
BIG DEMAND FOR NEW
SERIES 17 STUDEBAKER
FOLLOWS ANNOUNCEMENT
Record sales of the new Series 17
models are reported by_ the Studebak
er Corporation following the an­
nouncement of these care two weeks
ago. In fact, figures show that more
actual orders were received during the
past two weeks than in any similar
In anticipation of the big demand
for the new series 17 Studebaker Sixes
and Fours, the factory has been run­
ning full capacity, and more than 5,
000 of the latest models have been
shipped since January 1. Three thous­
and dealers are now showing the ser­
ies 17 cars and selling them as fast
as they come from the factory.
The production schedule for 1916
calls for 100,000 of the-newly an­
nounced models. It was originally
planned to build 60,000 cars, and the
schedule was later increased to 75,000.
The demand from dealers on the fir­
ing line forced the factory to still
further increase its contemplated out­
put to 100,000 machines.
From all over the country come re-
Cve
*r
rts that the salesrooms of dealers
been thronged since the introduc­
tion of the series 17 cars to the pub
lie. These models are noted for the
fact that they incorporate 11 added re­
finements, maintain their former me­
chanical quality, and in several in­
stances show reductions in price.
The custom "of buying cars at the
New York automobile show was re­
vived when more than 350 of the ser­
ies 17 Sfudebakers were sold at re­
tail during show week.
Dealers all over the country are Bu­
ying to the home office in Detroit
or increased allotments of cars, and
a shortage is feared, notwithstanding
the planned production of 100,000 dur­
ing this year.
Martin Aakrann Wins Two Prizes on
Grain.
Martin Aakrann of this city was one
of the prize winners of the North Da­
kota Improved Seed Growers contest
at Fargo last week. Mr. Aakrann
won two prizes on high scores for his
Swedish Select oats and barley grown
on his Norwich farm. Nearly five
hundred farmers entered exhibits in"
the contest, so this was a signal non
or for the Minot man. Mr. Aakrann
ha'' 5,000 bushels of the oats left
which he will sell for seed. Had Mr.
Aakrann produced the necessary vou­
cher as to the number of acres of the
oats he raised, which was 97 acres,
he would have caried off the cham­
pionship prize on the oats.
The meeting lasted four days with a
banquet on the evening of the last
day.
CEORCE H'FADDEN
PIONEER BARBER PASSED AWAY
WHILE WORKING AT HIS
CHAIR AT JENSEN'S BARBER
SHOP THIS AFTERNOON.
George McFadden, Minot's pioneer
barber, died suddenly of heart fail­
ure while working at his chair at Jen­
sen's barber shop located just north
of the Sqo track on .Main street at 2
o'clock thi$ afternoon. He was shav­
ing a customer and had stepped aside
to strop his razor when he fell dead.
Those who were in the shop hurried to
his side but death had been instan­
taneous.
The funeral will be held Monday af­
ternoon from the Hauges Lutheran
church and burial will take place in
Rose Hill cemetery.
George McFadden was born at
Plattsburg, N. Y., 58 years ago the
27th of last August. When a small
boy he moved with his parents to Aus­
tin, Minn. His father for years was
an engineer on the Milwaukee road.
He joined the U. S. army and served
at the post at Poplar, Mont., for five
years.. .While serving in that capac­
ity Wlearhed 'the&arber's trade.
Mr.' McFadden ca'jire td' Minot 23
years ago the first dfl&sl? September
and' opened a shop in the old Cooper
building, located where the Soo depot
now stands. He had been engaged at
his trade in this city ever since. He
was considered an especially able
workman.
He was married to Miss Bella Oen
in this city Sept. 21, 1892, and to this
union four children were born: Leon,
who is connected with a clothing store
at Avoka, la. Chester, Dora and Hel­
en. He is also survived by a brother,
Charlie, of Salt Lake City, Utah, a
former resident of this city.
Mr. McFadden had had heart trou­
ble some years ago but was enjoying
better health than usual this winter.
The deceased was a man greatly at­
tached to his family. He leaves a host
of friends who join the Independent in
extending sincere sympathy to those
bereaved.
Patent Will Make Farmer Boys Rich.
Roy Williams, the 17-year-old son
of T. M. Williams, the Des Lacs auc­
tioneer, has invented & steering ap­
paratus for the traction engine that
will make him a large sum of money.
Associated with him is Herschel Wag­
goner, the 17-year-old son of Hender­
son Waggoner, another prominent
farmer. The boys worked out the
experiment on Waggoner's engine be­
fore getting their patentT They have
been offered $10,000 for the Canadian
rights, which they may accept.
The steering device is said to work
perfectly. The wheels of the device
run in the same furrow, one behind the
other, and buckle, allowing the engine
to turn around in the shortest manner
possible. The wheels keep the furrow
without guidance and require atten­
tion only at the end of the rounds, al­
lowing one man to operate the out­
fit. Young Williams is a genius and
both boys have more than the ordi­
nary amount of business ability.
POULTRY EXHIBITS WANTED.
The committee in charge of the ar­
rangements for the Northwestern
Mid-winter Fair would like all poultry
raisers, not only of this part of the
state, but the city of Minot, to enter
their birds next week. Plans have been
made to have ample room for a good­
ly number of poultry exhibits, and
special care will be taken of the fowl.
Entrance is free.
The ladies of the United Lutheran
church will serve dinner and supper
for 35 cents Wednesday, Thursday and
possibly Friday of next week, during
the Mid-winter Fair. Farmers espec­
ially are invited. These ladies have
won a splendid reputation for serving
good meals.
V. A. Asplund of Glenburn shipped
a car of hogs to St. Paul last week.
THE WARD COUNTY INDEPENDENT
THE INDEPENDENT HAS THE LARGEST CIRCULATION OF ANY WEEKLY PAPER IN THE STATE
N. G. OLSON
BUYS THE GROW
CLOTHING STORE
BIG GRAND FORKS CONCERN
ADDS EMPORIUM IN MINOT TO
ITS LARGE CHAIN OF STORES.
M. G. Olson & Co., of Grand Forks,
have bought the store of the Grow
Clothing Co. and will take immediate
possession. Mr. Olson and W. E. Bor
ene, who will be the local manager,
are here this week assisting in taking
inventory and the store will be re
opened Friday of this week. Mr. Bor
ene is a member of the firm, having
been connected with the Olson line
of stores for the past twelve years.
Th M. G. Olson Co. operates cloth­
ing stores in the following cities:
Grand Forks, Minot, Sioux Falls, S.
D., Watertown, S. D., Brookings, S. D.,
Huron, S. D., Sisseton, S. D., Rapid
City, S. D., Montivideo, Minn., Mar­
shall, Minn., and Wheaton, Minn.
It is the intention of the new firm
to equip the Minot store similar to
that of their Grand Forks, store, giv­
ing Minot one of the very finest cloth­
ing emporiums in North Dakota.
The Grand Forks store was opened
eight years ago and the concern has
developed the greatest business of the
kind in the Northwest, by their meth­
ods of doing business and thru their
large purchasing power. With Minot
added to their list, the chain of stores
will be strengthened, for the company
soon expects to develop the Minot
store in such a way that it will head
the list. The growth of the Olson
stores has been little less than phe­
nomenal.
The present stock will be sold at
reduced prices to get them out of the
way for spring merchandise which is
being manufactured especially for the
Olson stores.
The Independent is pleased to learn
that Chas. A. Grow, who has managed
the Grow Clothing Co.„ will not leave
the city. Mr. Grow has extensive real
estate interests in Minot and vicinity
He will engage in the real estate bus­
iness, buila and sell houses and he
will most likely incorporate a com­
pany that will enable him to do busi­
ness on an exceedingly large scale.
Mr. Grow came to this city and en­
gaged in the clothing business four­
teen years ago and with the exception
of one year he has been engaged in
this business ever since. He has al­
ways conducted one of the highest
class stores in the Northwest. He is
one of Minot's most public spirited
citizens and one of the biggest heart­
ed fellows on earth. The Independent
trusts that he will be just,as success­
ful in the real estate business as he
has been in the clothing business and
we feel certain that he will.

CLERK OF COURT
COMMISSIONER FROM SECOND
DISTRICT WILL NOT BE CANDI­
DATE FOR RE-ELECTION
WILL TRY FOR HAGEN'S
PLACE.
B. J. Anderson, commissioner from
the Second district, Ward county, dur­
ing the past four years, will not be a
candidate for re-election, for he has
decided to enter the race for Clerk of
the District Court. Mr. Anderson has
been a faithful commissioner, is at
present chairman of the board and he
has done especially good work. He
states that he can no longer afford to
serve the county in the present capac­
ity, as much as he enjoys the work.
Mr. Anderson stands a good chance
of being elected Clerk of Court. He
enjoys a wide acquaintance over the
county and is well liked.
Predict Higher Price for July Wheat.
Myers & Co., the Minot grain com­
mission firm, predicts that July wheat
will sell a great deal higher than at
present. The people have watched
the results of the predictions of this
firm and in every instance they have
struck the market right. They state
that the high point for July wheat
on last year's crop was $1.45, when
prospects for a bumper yield were ap­
parent. This year prices are 20 cents
lower with a reduced acreage and con­
ditions not favorable for the coming
crop.
Arthur Church Died Relatives Un­
known.
Arthur Church, a young man about
25 years old, died at the hospital Jan.
28th from cerebral hemorrhage. The
young man was taken ill in October
while working on a farm north of the
city and he was brot to the hospital.
He had been unable to speak or write
since and died without telling the

cared for by the county and was bur­
ied in the potter's field.

yer for fourteen years, has rented his
farm and will go to Washburn in the
spring, where a brother lives. He owns
a 320 acre farm which will be tilled by
Fred Huber.

CLEARS
LINE-UP OF REPUBLICAN AND
PROGRESSIVE PRIMARY CAN­
DIDATES BECOMES DEFINITE
18 REPORT.
Grand Forks, N. D., Feb. 2.—The
week has been prolific of many inter­
esting movements politically in North
Dakota, and for the first time the
probable line-up of at least two par­
ties in the first, or presidential pri­
mary election, is made clear.
.. LaFollette and Estabrook.
In the republican party, LaFollette
wi!" run for the indorsement and the
No th Dakota Progressive Repubilcan
lea'lme will put forth a set of candi­
dates for delegates, seeking their elec­
tion.
The Estabrook people will place his
name on the primary ballot, but so
far as is now evident he will be the
only candidate opposing LaFollette,
since Hughes, Root, Roosevelt and
several others have declined to permit
the use of their names.
Cummins is Stronger.
United States Senator Cummins, by
giving way to LaFollette on the lat
ter's insistent demand, has strength­
ened his standing with a big portion
of the Republicans in North Dakota.
Senatorial Complications.
It is also evident that thffre are
Progresive Republicans in North Da­
kota who will not stand by passively
and watch Senator McCumber and
Governor Hanna fight alone for sena­
torial honors. The league is seeking
to bring August Johnson of McLean
county into the field. If that plan
fails, then R. A. Nestos of Minot may
take up the fight.
The Attorney Generalship.
II. J. Linde, attorney general, also
is promised vigorous opposition in the
coming primaries, for the society of
Equity forces this week joined hands
with the Progressives, declaring their
intention of backing William Langer
of Morton county, if the latter will
make the fight for the office.
This step is taken because of Linde's
activity in opposition to the society of
Equity, evidenced by his suit aganist
the organization last summer.
National Committeeman.
.The National committeeman situa­
tion in the Republican party took an
interesting turn when the Progres­
sive Republican league refused to in­
dorse H. N. Tucker of Courtenay, but
tendered its support to William Lemp
ke of Fargo instead. Considering the
fact that Thomas Marshall, the pres­
ent national committeeman, always
has been regarded as a strong Pro­
gressive, this attitude predicts that
Marshall will not be a candidate for
re-election.
MMOT WOMAN'S
RE­
COUNT IMHL
MRS. KERMOTT SURPRISES THE
CURLERS AT THE ST. PAUL
BONSPIEL BY HER CLASSY
WORK—ONLY WOMAN SKIP IN
CONTEST.
The following taken from the St.
Paul Dispatch, will prove interesting
to our readers. Mrs. Kermott is re­
garded as one of Minot's most en­
thusiastic sportswomen. She takes a
great deal of interest in out-of-door
sports and is an expert swimmer as
well as curler.
St. Paul's carnival bonspiel is to be
honored with the presence of the only
woman curler who skips a rink of men
and who, in the opinion of the other
curlers from Minot, N. D., is "some
skip."
The feminine expert is Mrs. L. H.
Kermott, wife of Dr. L. H. Kermott
of Minot, also an enthusiastic devotee
of the game.
Mrs. Kermott has been curling for
two years, and her devotion to the
game is such that she rarely lets the
sun go down on a winter day without
playing in from one to four games.
R. E. Barron, one of the four Minot
skips here for the bonspiel, says Mrs.
Kermott is a "corking good" curler,
and he should know, for he has been
playing with and against her for two
winters. Mrs. Kermott says she likes
the game, and in order to indulge her
fondness for the Scottish pastime she
has been obliged to play with the men,
because curling has not become popu­
lar with the women of Minot.
Mrs. Kermott uses forty-pound
rocks and has no difficulty in getting
them "in the house," even on sticky
ice. The gallantry of the curlers of
St. Paul will be put to the test when
they meet this feminine Dunbar, but
she says she asks no odds of any of
the men, and if they can beat her she
hopes they will try their best.
The four Minot rinks are registered
at The St. Paul.
The personnel of the rinks folows:
A. A. Robinson, Bert Stewart, R. A.
Piper, Dr. A. D. McCannell, skip F.
W. Roach, B. H. Bradford, J. C. Small
wood, R. E. Barron, skip: M. Mulroy,
C. Dierdorff, Dr. L. H. Kermott, Dr.
J. R. Pence, skip Hart Swalstead, W.
S. Shaw, T. N. Fuller, Mrs. L. H. Ker
mott, skip.
Mr. Shaw is president of the city
commission of Minot and Mr. Robinson
is the president of the curling club.
Coal Shortage at Des Lacs.
Bill Bergh, mayor of Des Lacs, was
in the city Monday. Altho his town
lies only four miles from a fine coal
mine, there has been a positive short­
age of fuel because teams could not
haul the lignite. The residents com­
mandeered a car of coal belonging to
the G. N., putting up their money in
the bank. Two cars of coal arrived
Saturday and instead of going to
church Sunday the residents laid in a
supply of coal, 800 pounds being sold
to a customer.
Better Baby Week Will Be Observed.
Better Baby Week, which will be
celebrated all over the United States
the week of March 5, will be observed
in Minot. The arrangements are in
the hands of the three federated clubs.
The following committees have been
appointed:
Woman's Club—Mrs. Weinrebe,
Mrs. Francis and Mrs. Ringo.
Art Club—Mrs. Davis, Mrs. R. Pip­
er and Mrs. Kennard.
Musical Club—Mrs. Coar, Mrs. Per­
son and Mrs. Boyer.
Special services will be held at the
churches Sunday, March 5. A mass
meeting will be held Monday, March
0 and exercises will be held in the
schools Tuesday, March 7. Doctors,
dentists and nurses will give lectures
on the care of children. Special mov­
ing pictures may be shown at the
theatres during the week.
