Sleeveless nighties, ankle short
Are the new alluring sort
In them Sue's so sweet a sight,
'Tis a shame to douse the light
The newest nighties are bound
to be a source of vexation
to those unfortunates whose
vaccinations thus laid bare,
either by the lack of sleeve
or the lack of length. But
who can cteny that they are ador
able? It takes little material
but lots o_f art to evolve them
and a little nerve and lots of
charm to wear 'em. About the
only way you can tell a nighties
from a chemise these days and
nights is by inches.
Nighties Blush
The chemise is cut just above
the knee and the nightie just be
low it. It is true that most of the
nighties actually blush for their
own shortcomings and this beaut
iful blush pink dyes them whether
they be of siheer batiste crepe de
chine of the new wash satin. It
takes lots of sibilants to describe
them and but little else—sheer,
short, sleeveless and simple will
do the work and there you have
it.
Sleeping Garments Dwindling

every respect the new nighties are
also short waisted and the empire

smartest models. Narrow row

holes and low neck line briar

gienic, allowing as they do for so
much fresh air, but one shudders
to think how soon these ducks of
nighties will became an extinct
species along- with the dodo bird
and other rare avis, if they keep
on dwindling away to nothing in
this reckless way they have bo
gun.
Caps Getting Reckless
As for caps to top the dishevel
ed matutinal looks of milady fair,
they are gelling reckless, too.
Time was when a boudior cap
meant a coquettish little morsel
of ribbon and lace and net, or at
most, pasted tinted bits of chif
fon or crepe do chine. Nowa
lihys one must lie coiffed like a

although not the largest.
NORTH DAKOTA BEST SEL

One of the strong points made
by the advertising experts at the
Press Association Convention at
Grand Forks recently was that
Advertisers in the North Dakota
newspapers get more for their
money than those in other parts
of the country.

the value of advertising. Its effic

many occasions to need a fresh
demonstration today. And the
men who have made the closest
study of the subject, and are most
conversant with it are united in
the opinion that the newspaper is
by all means the best advertising
medium known.
There is a special reason why
North Dakota newspaper publish
ers should just now pay more
