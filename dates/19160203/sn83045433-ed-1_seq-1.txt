"There are many good harbors and

Prohibition Bills Denounced
at Banquet of National

LANGUAGE IS BITTER
National Prohibition a Chim
era, Declares Representa
tive Meeker, of Missouri.
"When God so changes the forces of
nature that the Juices of fruit will not
ferment, then, and then only, will there
be national prohibition." declured Repre
sentative Meeker, of Missouri, in an ad
dress at the annual banquet of the Na
tional Retail liquor Dealers* Association
at the New National last night.
With voices that fairly quivered with
pent-up feelings and opinions which they
cannot express fully on the floor of the
House, nearly a score of Representatives
bitterly denounced the proposed Sheppard
bill and Hobson r?mcnilment. Each mem
ber of Congress ?iledged himself to light
vigorously not only against national pro
hibition, which they declared would be a
chimera, but also against prohibition for
the District.
Representative Meeker, after declaring
that the Anti-Saloon League is the most
corrupt political organization ln the
United Slates, said:
"The greatest danger to the United
States as a country today is the en
croachment of the church Into politics.
A state hais never existed yet where poli
tics was dominated by the church; lt has
always been destroyed."
Referring to tlie legislators who are
backing prohibition, he said:
?? "Dry" Leaders Denonnretl.
"What I want to see Is a bill thst win
make the buying of a drink a crime.
When that bill Is introduced you will
see the Capitol turn up-side down."
Slating that there were two "star" Anti
Saloon i-aeague leaders outside the banquet
door. Representative Gajtrtn. ot Mma
sachusets. In a voice that could be
heard all over the hotel, denounced the
members of the league in scathing words.
Concluding, Mr. Galvln declared that ?aa
always he would continue to stand by
the men of the District of Columbia on
the floor of the House.
Asserting that he knew something of
the troubles of the members of the as
sociation. Repreeentatlve Dyer, of Mis
souri, told the members that they could
trust the J'idlciary Committee to do what
they a-onsider best for the people and not
rob them of their liberty. The Hobson
amendment is at the Capitol now, he
said, and It will be there for a long
time to come.
The prohibition bills now before Con

and selfishness, and he declared that aa

Senate Passes Amendment
Promising Filipino Inde
pendence m Four Years.
Th? Senate yesterday by tie vote, the
Vice President voting affirmatively to
break the tic. adopted the Clarke amend
ment to the Philippin*? civil government
hill, overturning the report of the Sen
ate Committee on the Philippines and
coin:; on record ln favor of the absolute
Independency for the Filipinos after two
years from the passage of the act and not
Inter than four year.?.
The vate was not entirely a surprise.
Sentiment haa been growing since the
Philippines bill hai? been before the Sen
ate in favor of absolute and uncondi
tional independency. The Senate voted
Tuesday to retain a coaling station and
naval base In the islands so It is to be |
expected that when the bill la finally
perfected lt will reserve this as the onlv (
remrant of American authority In th* ?
archipelago. The Senate yeeterday struck ;
out of the Clarke amendment the autho- j
rization to th#? President to negotiate ha- ?
ternatlonal agreements looking to the re- ?
spect and recognition by the great power? j
of the independency and neutrality of the |
islands.
The effect of tlie two votes was to pro- j
vide for the reltnqulshment of Ameri
can sovereignty, the complete independen
ce- of the Philippines, but without any
guarantee by the United States for the
future.
A compromise amendment submitted
was voted down. It was the opinion thit j
this bill represented the last stand of
the administration ln the fight against ;
the Clarke amendment.
