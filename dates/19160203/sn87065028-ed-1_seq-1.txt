Although the atmosphere Tuesday
whs tlurk anil dismal the day was,

bright ami glorious one for local
adolesents, as citizens of Colirribus
and its vicinage then voted to issue
bonds in the sum of $50,000 for the

While the need for a new hirrh

cognized and generally conceded,
there was some opposition to the

opposition manifested itself at the
polls, there having been cast 304
votes in favor of the proposition and
228 against it, thus giving a clear
majority of 76 votes in favor of the
school.
Intense interest marked the cam
paign, which was brought to a dra
matic close Tuesday with a monster
parade in which more than one
thousand teachers and students par
ticipated. The parade, which was led
by Prof. W. V. Friersoh, Jr., super
intendent of the public schools,
formed at Franklin Academy at 10
o'clock Tuesday morning, and wend
ed its way majestically through the
business and residential section of
Columbus. The pageant was fully
five blocks long, the scholars in the
different grades having been led by
their respective instructors, and
many of the boys and girfs carried
banners on which were inscribed ur
gent appeals to citizens to vote for
the, issuance of the bonds.
In their efforts on behalf of the
bond issue the teachers and students
were ably assisted by members of the
Civic League and it is largely due to
the efficient and enthusiastic work on
the part of these public spirited la
dies that the fight was finally won.

Although the weather Tuesday af

in sheltered places near the city
hall, where the election was held,
and urged citizens as they passed by

The heaviest vote was polled in

it was possible for citizens to reach
the city hall without being subjected
to the fury of the elements, but in

It has been intimated in press dis
patches sent out from Washington
Jhat an effort would be made in the
Senate to prevent the confirmation
of Louis D. Brandies of Boston,
who was recently appointed by pres
dent Wilson to succeed the lateJudge
Lamar as associate justice of the
United States Supreme Court, but a
recent special to the New Orleans
Tinies-ricayune declares that hte
Mississippi and Louisiana Senators
will not participate in this effort.
The special follows:
"Louisiana and Mississippi sena
tors will offer no obstacle to the con
firmation of Louis D. Brandies as as
sociate justice of the Supreme Court.
While senators will not make any
statement as to how they will cast
their votes in executive session they
are not adverse to giving their per
sonal impressions of men who have
been nominated for office by the
President.
"Senator Vardaman said today
that he spent an hour reading every
thing that the newspapers had been
able to ascertain that might be used
n;,ainst the man. Each of these pos
sible objections recommended' Mr.
Brandies to him, he said.
"Senator RansdelJ is known

REVIVES RID K!ES!
PLAY WAS PRESENTED HERE i
THIRTY YEARS AGO
J. H. HUNTLEY.
BY
The presentation of Mr. Frances I
Hodg.,0.1 Burnett's'" rfrw old
romantic drama, "Esmaralda," on I
the screen at the Princess Theatre 1
Monday night awakened in the '
hearts of veteran theatra-goers
memories of J. H. Huntley, who, in
t:ifi old days of Concert Hall, vi.iii.ed '
Columbus nearly every season nd '
who, on several occasions, presented
the play here.
The action of the play takes place
during the decade between 1870 !
and 1880, and its scenes and c-oh- t
tumes are naturally supposed to re- j
fleet the customs of that period.
While Mary Pickford, who interpre
ted the title role, dressed the part
appropriately other members of the
cast exhibited little discretion in
the selection of their costumes. The
actor who played Dave Hary, "Es
meralda's sweetheart," wore a neg
ligee shirt with one of those trjan-gular-pointed
collars which are so
much in evidence these days but
which were unknown during the per
iod in which the action of the play
is supposed to take place. Other
members of the cast were inappro
priately dressed, but the most glar
ing inaccuracy was the introduction
of automobiles, which had not been
invented when Mrs. Bennett wrote
the play.
Moving picture directors claim to
devote special attention to details,
and it is therefore somewhat surpris
ing that these incongruities escaped
the notice of the mart vho supervis
ed the screen production of "Esmer
alda."

to the people of this section, as it
will not only show the extent to

report telling us how to eradicate
these eilments and how to prevent

In order to reap tho full benefits
of the survey it will be necessary for
local health officers to co-operate

WHISKETs HE TAKES AS APPEAL
PROMINENT MAIN STREET
MERCHANT CONVICTED ON

Mr. J. W. MoClung, a prominent
Main street merchant, was tried be
fore Actoig Mayor McClanuhan and
a jury yesterday afternoon on ths
charge of retailing and, upon eon vie
I .'i, was sentenced to pay a fine of
and serve UO days on the county
.'arm. An appeal w,i taken and thej
li; endant placed under bond in the
sum of $200 to appear before the
next term' of circuit court.
The testimony was conflicting, the
jury having been out more than a
hour before a verdict was reached,
and Mr. McClung has numerous
friends who hope that he can estab
lish his innocence when the case
comes up for trial in the circuit
court.
Mr. McClung was defended by

Sturdivant, Owen & Garnett, while
Hon. E. E. Callaway, of the firm of

The i nking differences I e' Ain
the new bill and the one whuh fail
ed in the Senate last year are mod
tfii ition of the government opera
'ion f- ,f i.i and broudeninif of th-i
powers of the shipping board which
it is joopo-vd to create. Government
cperatoin under the new bill would
be entered upon only as a last re
.it if private capital fails to re
spond to the enterprise. The ship
Vug board would he empowered to
regulate ail interstate and foreign
c .mmerce in American waters us the
interstate commerce commission reg
ulates interstate railway traffic.
livery effort has been made to
draw the bill so as to encourage Am
erican capital to help upbuild the
merchant marine and to protect it
rom unfair foreign competition, and
government vessels never would op
erate on lines where an American
company was furnishing satisfactory
ervice at fair rates. The out and
out government ownership feature
of the old bill aroused so much oppo
sition that it was generally conceded
to have been one of the primary
lau.sw for failure of the measure.
An initial appropriation of $50,
000,000 for the purchase of lease of
vessels to be obtained by the sale of '
Panama canal bonds and the appoint
ment of the shipping board of five
members are the first objects of the
new bill. The Secretary of the Navy
nnd the Secretary of Commerce will
be ex-ofiicio members of the board,
and the other three members would
he "men of large practical exper
ience" in foreign commerce. They
would be appointed by the President
arid receive $10,000 a year each. A
secretary would receive $5,000 a
year and the remainder of the board
employes, except an attorney, would
come from the civil service lists of
the federal government.
With the $50,000 the board would
nri.-anie a corporation to lease, buy
charter or build ships. It would be
restricted to the purchase of as
many American made vessels as pos
sible. Ships constructed in foreign
oMiitrii's would be limited to for-
!. n tnuie only, the tioant wouui
offer ttock to citizens of the United
nnU-:;, and if all were subscribed,
he board need never operate a snip.
Failing to interest private capital,,
however, the board could operate
vessels.
Both vessels controlled by the
board and those which had passed
into private hands by lease or char
ter, would be subject to the call at
all times of the president in case of
war. Members of the crew and offi
cers could volunteer at anytime for
service in the naval auxiliary and
would receive from $5 to $15 a
month from the time of enlistment.
