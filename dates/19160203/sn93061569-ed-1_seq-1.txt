MORTUARY
Henry, the oldest son of Mrs. Rose
of this place, died tn Monday of the
week, near their claim about six
miles northwest of Des Moines. He
was brought to Clayton by friends
and the body prepared for burial.
On Tuesday Mrs. Rose took his re
mains to their former home near
Pawnee Rock, Kansas, for burial.
Mrs. Rose seems to be having her
portion of grief. Six months before,
to the day, her husband was kicked
by a mule and lulled, while away
from home, leaving her with seven
(hildren to care for. She has been
doing the best that, could ne ex
pected and since coming here to
send the children to school has had
various things to oo to make a liv
ing, and at the present time was
keeping boarders in the west part
of town. On Sunday of tlie week she
was notified that the hoy was sick
with the rheumatism, and on Mon
day she was notified that he was
worse and for her to come. Upon
arriving at the home of Mr. Sam
Miller, where he had been staying,
she found to her grief that the Grim
Monster had come and taken away
the boy. She certainly has the sym
pathy of the entire city in this her
great bereavement. Ho died of
pneumonia.
The
Power of Advertising
By JOHN H. FAHEY
'President of the Chamher of Commerce of the
United States. .
If there are still extant men who ask
the question "Does it pay to advestise?"
I know their thinking is of the kind which
would lead them to light factories with
candles and insists upon the advantages
which would accrue if the residents of
modern cities still drew their water supply
by bucket from the town well.
When nations in the greatest struggle of
history adveatise for armies; when kings
and emperors and sultans come down from
their thrones to seek the attention of the
world and present their pleas and defen
ses through the press;when it has become
the daily bread of a large part of the
world's business, it is indeed a man of
limited mentality who still questions the
power of publicity. It's value, to society
has, in fact, so impressed itself that to-day
publicity is the light of the world- It may
be said, with little element of speculation
in t ie assertion, that if 'publicity had
characteiized dealings between the na
tions of Europe during the past 50 years
and secret-diplcfr.scy ltd teen eliminated
the present world wnr, with its terrorism
and threat to all civilization, would net t
now be raging.
t
The only daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Emmet Mock passed out of this life
last Wednesday. The cause of her
death was heart failure brought on
by the after effects of diptheria.
Drs. Daniels and Slack were the at
tending physicians. Little Edna was
a neighborhood pet in the commun
ity in which she lived and was an
exceptionally bright child. She was
the idol of her parents heart being
the only dahtep in a family. of five
children. She was the joy and sun
shine of every gathering and en
deared herself to everyone who
knew her. Her death leaves a vacan
cy that will not be easily nor soon
tilled.
She was laid away in the Creed
cemetery after a short hut impres
ive service conducted by the Rev.
Self. To the family and friends we
xtend pwv warmest sympathies and
hope that time and the Giver of all
Good will heal their hearts.
Sleep on Beloved, and take thy
rest,
Lay down thy burdens on the Sav
ior's breast,
We loved you well but Jesus loves
you best.
Sleep on, sleep on, sleep on."
tVrthur Ray P'airchilds of near
Thomas, died on Monday of this
week with Typhoid fever, and was
buried on Wednesday of the week
near Thomas, Rev. J. Q. Herrin, of
Clayton, ofllcialing at the ceremony
He was a member of the - Baptist
church, also of the I. O. 0. F. Lodge,
the members of the lodge taking
charge of the ceremonies at the
grave. .Mr. l-aírennos came Here
from Sawyer, Kans., about a year
ago, and located on a claim where
he died. He leaves a wife and small
son, Murline, to mourn his depart
ure. His parents, three sisters and
one brother were here from Kansas
to attend the funeral. He was about
30 years of age.
First Socialist Lecture
The Socialist lecture on last Sun
day was reasonably well attended
Only reasonably, we think, consid
ering the fact that we were being
addressed by a man who has had a
part in "doing" things in other parts
to the extent that he has acquired
for himself a nation-wide reputa
lion iinnj.'ii those w ith whom lie is
cssociat.ed. He had the personal
power niul ;bili!y to li;'k both par
ties at. ine time fix thi' first office
in a city of many thousand, and al
though we are frank lo say that in
our opinion it was not the popularity
of the party that turned the trick
but the individuality of the man
that put him over. YOU lose when
vou fail to hear lhe men.
James-Evans Nuptials '
Mr. J. M. James of Oklahoma, and
Miss Emma Evans of near Mount
Dora, were united in Holy wedlock

hood. The young people will make their

enjoyed wishing the young people
God speed we said goodby.

Railroad

g
Corporation Commission, and
C & S Officials meet with
Business Mens As's'n
As was previously announced, the
Corporation Commission and "some
of the, officials of the Colorado and.
Southern railroad met with somo
of the business men of the town at
the Palmer hall on last Saturday
P. M. More of the business men of
the town should have been present
its there were things discussed that
were of interest to them and to the
city and the business interests of
the town generally. This Is a .thing
that many of us have a 'habit of neg-'
lecting until such time-as there is
a proposition up to do some much
needed good for the town and then
we take a few hours off Jo attend to
duties that we do not care to relate.
It began to look for a while that we,
as audience, were going to be in
the minority and that the Star Per
formers were in the majority, both
as-to numbers and otherwise. The
meeting was congenial all through
but it did look that when a repre
sentative body of this nature came
to our town that had to do with
things and conditions every day that
are vital to the personal and general
interests of the town that we as a'
body of business men should be
THERE. If we don't do very much,
the effect and the impression is
worth while. As was previously an
nounced the rate question was un
der discussion, and to the best of
our ability, the sense of the meeting
so far as we were concerned was to
the effect that we were glad to let.
well enough 'alone,, so far as freight
rates were concerned. Some of us-
probably had thought before, other
had not and only found out just
where we were after we had taken
considerable time to kick aDout it.
The proposed rate isc not of in
terest to us here at Clayton at the
present time. This will be the con
clusion of every man that will take
the time to investigate the rates and
will compare them with the rates
proposed by the C. & S. ofllcials and
the Corporation Commission.
There are things that are vital
to the town that could and should
have been discussed, in our opinion,
and these are the things that we
have overlooked, and allowed to go
by almost un-noticed. One of these
is the street crossing question and
another is the matter of a new de
pot and some repairs around the
station and things of this sort, in
cluding track scales, should we have
met with these men eninasse and
presented in a reasonable and log
ical and emphatic manner, we might
have started something.
Withal, the. meeting, was a bene
llcial one, people and olllcials be
come better acquainted with each
others' need and wishes and we
make it easier to, get to "common
ground" when we get together the
next time.
