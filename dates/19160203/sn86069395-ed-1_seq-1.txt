THE APPAM
CAPTURED BY
GERMANS
Vessel Given Up for Lost
Reaches Port With German
Prize Crew Aboard.
LINER IN AMERICAN WATERS
Startling Story Told by Captain,
of British Passenger Sinks
Seven Ships.
Norfolk, Va., Feb. 2. Give up for
lost days ago, the British passenger
liner Appam, plying in the West Af
rican trade, appeared like an appari
tion in Hampton Roads yesterday,
flying thn German naval ensign and
with her ship's company under guard
of a German prize crew. She
brought word of a mysterious Ger
man commerce raider, the Moewe,
which now roams the seas, and had
on board the crews of seven British
merchantmen and admiralty trans
ports captured by the Moewe before
she seized the Appamand started her
across the Atlantic for an American
port with Lieut. Hans Berge of the
German naval reserve, and twenty
two men in charge.
According to the story told with
great reserve by Lieutenant Berge to
Collector Hamilton when he formally
reported his presence in American
territorial waters the Moewe raptured
the Appam, bound from Dakar, Brit
ish West Africa, foe Liverpool after a
brief show of resistance on January
16, sixty miles-Herjh of the Madeira
Islands. On board the Moewe, then
were the crews of five vessels, previ
ously captured,- all of whom were
transferred to the Appam.
These ships were Clan Mac Tavish,
sank Jan. 17 with a loss of 15 men;
Farringford sank Jan. 10; Corbridge
captured and converted into a collier
with 6,000 tons of coalJan. 10; Dro
mondy transport Jan. 13. The Au
thor, Trader and Ariadne, steamers
loaded with sugar, wheat and other
cargoes also met and sunk. All
Ql their crews arc aboard the Appam.
On board the Appam all told are
452 persons the prize crew of 23;
twenty German civilians who were
on their way la England for intern
ment; 188 seamen captured with the
British ships; 116 passengers and the
Appam's crew of 155.
Limit. Bcnre claims the Appam is a
prize of war
but government officials
have not yet accepted this view.
She had one' mounted rifle aboard
when captured, but this was removed
by the Moewo and there were -no ( er was then named to go to Frank
guns aboard when she reached port fort and urge thaT pinwngo of both
except small arms carried by the prize
crow.
No one knows where the Moowe
came from, oxcept the prize crew
aboard the Appam, nor whore she
went after the battlo with the Clan
McTavish. Apparently all of the
operations revealed by the arrival of
the Appam took placQjn the vicinity
of th6 Canary islands.
I The Appam now lies off Old Point
Comfort, under the guns. of Fortress
Monroe, waiting for the state dejwrt-
' ment at Washington to determine her
status whether liable to internment
or a German prize.

BASKET BALL
GAMES FRIDAY
Double Header at The McLean
Gym, Boys Playing Pa-
ducah Team.
FIRST GAME WITH RIVER TOWN
Locals Are Being Given a Special
Work-out In Basket
Shooting. Friday night at McLean Gym the
Hopkinsville High School will play
the Paducah High School. Paducah
has an unusually strong team this
year and they are coming confident of
victory. This is the first time the
High School has ever played Paducah
in basket ball. This year High School
plays Paducah twice. They will play
the second game in Paducah in about
two weeks,
Coach Mallory is giving his team a
good work-out in basket-shooting this
week. This seemed High School's
only trouble in the Guthrie game.
The team will have another advantage
over the one last Friday night in hav
ing Torian back in the game. Torian
is a splendid guard and has lots of
"pep," so his return to the game will
be a great advantage to Hopkinsville.
The line-up will probably be Brown,
center; Breathitt and Roberts, for
wards; Torian and Moscley, guards.
Another feature will be a girls'
game by the girls of the High School.
The game by the girls last Friday
night was much enjoyed and this one
will bo equally as good as the other.
Several out-of-town games for the
girls will be arranged later.

The President AtDes Moines
: When He Appealed For
Support.
WANTED PEACE WITH HONOR
President Wilson Asks People
What They Would Have
Him Do.
Des Moines, la., Feb. 2. President
Wilson, in addressing the largest au
dience of his present trip, in which he
is advocating preparedness, here last
night asked this question: "Do you
want the situation to be such that all
the President can do is to write mes
sages and utter words of protest?"
"Why, to ask that question is to an
swer, he said.
"When international law is violated
by one or the other of the belliger
ents," the President said, "America
was called upon to register a 'voice of
protest, of insistence.'
"Do you want the situation to be
such that all the President can do is
to write messages and utter words of
protest? If these breaches of inter
national law, which are in daily dan
ger of occurring, should touch the
very honor of the United States, do
you wisn to do notmng aooutr uo
you wish to have all the world say
that the flag of the United States can
be stained with impunity? Why, to
ask the question is to answer it.
1 know there is not a man or wo
man within the hearing of my voice
who would wish peace at the expense
of the honor of the United States."
I he 1'resident s address was punc
tuated with thunderous applause.
