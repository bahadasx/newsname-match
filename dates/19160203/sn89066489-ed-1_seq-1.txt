I V It Pays to Think.
Tfaterock road question ia at
- trading much interest . all over
the country.
. There are even people in Bates
County who think that it would
' be a good investment to build
"i. some.
- It is claimed that two hundred
' 'miles of .rock road would place
nearly every farm in Bates coun
ty within three miles of . one of
them. $800,000 would easily
' ' build these roads and probably
fifty miles more.
It does not cost anything to
think a little and" figger a little
In fact it pays.
.To prove that it pays two prizes
- are offered to the two persons in
Bates county, (no voter can com
pete) who will send in correct an
swers to the following four prob
7 lems in plain arithmetic. As- be
tween correct answers the pnes
- will be awarded to the first and
next plainest and neatest solu
tions.

Problem one i
The present assessed valuation
of Bates County for taxes is $13,
(52,260.81. Let it be supposed
" that taxes are collected upon only
$13,600,000 of this v amount and
that there will be no increase in
urooerty for taxation. - Then if
$800,000 in bonds were issued to
build good roads, these bonds pay :
able within twenty years and bear
ing five .per cent interest until
paid, what will be the indebted
ness of the county at the end of
the nineteenth year if a . levy of
forty-seven cents upon the $100 is
collected to pay interest and upon
principal for the first nineteen
years 1 And what levy will be re
quired for the twentieth year to
pay off the interest and all of the
balance of the debt at the end of
the twentieth yeart Remember
that the interest each year must be
paid off .before any payment is
made upon the principal. ' (That
all answers may be unif orm when
the interest figures in cents,
one dollar will be added instead
of odd amount. For instance if
the interest is $24,957.15 it will be
called $24,958.)
Problem two :
If a farmer owns 160 acres of
land assessed at $16 per acre, six
horses assessed at- $35 each, two
cows assessed at $20 each, thirty
Hogs assessed at $3 each and all
other property assessed at $200,
