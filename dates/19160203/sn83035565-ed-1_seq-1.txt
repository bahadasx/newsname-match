Letter from the South.
Punt- Gorda, Florida,
Jan. 21. 1916.
Editor Journal: Since. we were
here, two years airo, they have
built a sea wall and dredged in
sand, thus adding a long sea
front to the town. The added
ground (?) is about one half mile
in length and several hundred
feet wide, . It ould be a grea
improvement if the wall was
ever, half way right. The stones
show where the cement does not
cover, at low tide, and that is
the main drawback.
One of the pleasant events we
have enjoyed was an excursion
the Baptist Sunday school got up
to go down to Boca Grande. They
engaged the "Charles Wallace,"
a screw-propeller boat, of good
size and comfortable accommo
dations. The distance is about
24 miles and the boat made good
time. The day was truly ideal.
I wish I could make you see on
paper the lovely southern sky, so
brilliant and clear a blue, and the
dark green of the palms, . which
border every point and inlet.
The breeze was like a tonic, so
soft and fresh, and occasionally
a porpoise might be seen popping
up and down in the water. Lunch
was served on board and we land
ed at a dock from; which the
street led straight to the beach;
You get an unbroken view of the
Gulf of Mexico as far as the hor
izon, where the deep blue of the
sky aad the gulf water seem to
blend. The wonderful sight and
sound of its waves rolling in and
the beat of the surf on the sand
are among the most treasured
things of memory.
Well, we walked down the
beach all the way to South Boca
Grande, something over two
miles, but one does not notice the
distance. New things are to be
seen each step of the way. You
may gather shells until you Are
loaded down, then you see others
that look prettier and you pick
them up only to repeat the same
over and over.
We were permitted to go up in
the light house and were shown
the inside of the lamp and its
wonderful prismatic glass, and
we had a view of objects in gen
eral through field glasses. It, is
all so beautiful, that it fills one's
soul with a sense of grandeur al
most overpowering.
We rode back to Boca Grande
on a street car run by a storage
battery. The ride home in the
starlight was lovely. On each
side you could see the channel
lights, which, work automatically,
showing the path to be followed
by the boat.
One thing is certain, your ap
petite gets ravenous and you feel
like eating everything in sight.
The fish season opened on the
20th of January and it is worth
while to go down to the dock
when the fish boats come in. One
boat brought, in seventyfive thou
sand pounds last week. You can
buy almost any kind or size - of
fresh fish you want, and cheap,
too. .The bulk .of the fish are
shipped by freight to the north.
Those freight cars are scrubbed
perfectly clean, then the ice,
which is manufactured here, is
broken up into small pieces and
the fish are packed, so irany
thousand pounds to the car. It
is cleanly, all right. You can
buy fish, as 1 said, but why do so
when the men who fish, going
out in boats across the bay, get
so many that they sometimes put
them in carts and go around giv
ing them away. No tourist may
sell a fish without first paying
a $10 license. Last evening Mr
Wilson was out on the porch and
a neighbor tourist brought over
a dressed fish, saying they had a
surplus. Later, our friend on
the corner was heard outside in
quiring for Mr. Wilson and in
his absence, I answered the call,
and behold, he had two fish for
us that were each at least two
and a half feet in length and the
two weighed about 25 pounds. It
looked as if we were to be over
stocked with fish, but we in turn
gave one away and dressed the
other one for we four in the
house. Thty skin the fish here,
pulling skin and scales off with
pincers.
There is not fi large number of
tourists here this year and the
Punta Gorda Hotel is not open.
Many states are represented, but
there seems to .be mote" from
Ohio than any other state.
We never seen but one hard
rain in Florida, and that was a
bout two weeks ago, but it cer
tainly pours when it does come.
I wonder how many of you are
sitting outdoors this morning,
enjoying the lovely breeze, as I
am, and temperature at 72 de
grees?
With good wishes,
Mrs. Lorinda A. Wilson,

eases. If you are suffering from some ob
scure chronic disease, irom which you
have been unable to get relief, is it not
to your advantage to consult a skillful
specialist?
Dr. Kutchin's system of treatment
differs from many others. He only
employs pure herbal remedies, and
proceeds on principles which have
been thoroughly tested in the great
Hospitals of Europe and America.
Many diseases are benefited by his
methods. In chronic and obecure dis
eases he has achieved his most remark
able triumphs.
There are many cases in this county
that were given up to die, who have
been saved by his skill.
Why not go and see him and be ex-'

D. F. Gottschall and son of
Dayton gave Ye Scribe a social
call last Saturday night on his
way to visit his son-in-law, Cyrus
Hetzler, and family, over Sunday.
D. Moul and wife . of Pleasant
Hill visited relatives here last
Friday and Saturday.
I. M. Petersime's class of young
married people of our M. E. Sun
day school held, their class social
at the residence of their . teacher
last Friday night It is said a
goodly, number were present and
an enjoyable time was had.
Public sales seem to be the or
der of the day and attract large
attendance and stock generally
bringing good prices. About. this
time of year many changes take
place, which accounts for the
numerous sales. It seems that
we are not, for some reason, hav
ing the usual number of sales of
real estate, as compared with
other years. We , might have
more if our President were to
stop here on .bis itinerary and
convince our people that a , real
season of prosperity was on our
hands.
Madam Rumor has it that
Keith Canan of Cincinnati and
Anna Wilcox, teacher in our Ac
ademy, have been . secretly mar
ried. Probably she is correct in
her report as t people generally
accept, the report as true. May
their pajthwayi through life be one
of roses and sunshine.
January is going out with a
considerably elevated tempera
ture and plenty o( rain, giving
us very muddy roads, which, by
this time, are almost impassable.
The greater part of the month
has given us moderate tempera
ture, and if the remainder of the
winter shall be of the same kind
we will have no complaint of se
vere cold.
On last Friday morning Martin
Martindale, resident of our vic
inity d or about fifty years, died
very suddenly of the infirmities
of old age. Funeral services
were held onj Sunday afternoon
in our Presbyterian chureh, con
ducted by 'Rev. Furnace. Inter
ment, in cemetery nearby. He
was aged 77- years and 2 days. A
sister, of his immediate family,
and manyt more distant relatives,
survive him.

THE LURE OF MAGIC.
JVhy Ont Man Just Had to Rub El
br With a Conjurer.
Ambition takes men very differently.
One would enter puriinnu'iit and one
would have a play accepted at the
court; one would reacb the uortb pole.
and one would live ut Cblselburt.
while a fifth would lie happy If only
he had a motorcar. Speaking for my
self, my ambition lias always been to
have a conjuror perform under my
own roof, and it has Just happened. I
obtained him from the stores.
1 have never been so near magic bfr
fore. Like all great men when oue
comes closely in touch witb them, he
was quite human, quite like ourselves;
so much so Indeed that In addition to
bis fee be wanted bis cab fare both
ways. It is very human to want
things both ways.
I have been wondering bow long It
would take me to learn to be a con
jurer and If It Is not too late to begin
1 don't want to be a finished
conjurer. 1 merely waut to do three
tricks witb reasonable dexterity. Ot
course If one can do three tricks one
can do thirty, but It Is three, and three
only, i have in mind first. 1 want to
borrow a watch and put it In a pestle
and mortar and grind it to powder aud
then fire a pistol at a loaf of bread and
find the watch whole again in the
midst of the crumbs; second. I want to
borrow a tall hat and throw in flout
and break eggs into it and stir It all
up and bold it over a spirit lamp for
second and tben produce a beautiful
warm cake: third. I want to find bens
eggs In old men's beards and little
girls' hair.
Tricks with cards and money and so
forth I don't mind about, because 1
would always rather see them done
than do them, there is such fascination
in the clean, swift movement of the
conjurer with cards, his perfect mas
tery of his lingers, the supple beauty
of bis hands. And tricks witb machin
ery I would gladly forego.
My conjurer's most popular trick
was, of course, that which calls upon
the co-operation of a rabbit. I wrote
to him in advance to Insist on this
No man who at a children's party pro
duces a live rabbit, particularly when
It is very small and kicking and also
black and white. Is making a mistake.
No matter what has gone before, this
apparition will seal bis pogularitv.
The end crowns the work (as I could
say In Latin If I liked).
It was not only to the children that
this trick was welcome, but to an eld
erly literary friend of mine with whom
I have collaborated more than once
and into whose life 1 hoped to get a
little brightness by inducing him to
bring the tall bat which the wizard
should borrow. The thought filled him
with excitement It was bringing ra
diance Indeed Into his life to know
that this old hat, which had done
nothing more lomantlc than keep his
head warm all these years, was to be
used for magical purposes and have a
real rabbit extracted from It From
"Character and Comedy," by B. V
Lucas.
