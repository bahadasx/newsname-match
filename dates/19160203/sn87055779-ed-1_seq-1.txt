The suggestion that Pres't Wilson

made informally to .Sec'y of State

the German ambassador to the j

There is no Rood reason to doubt
that the German peace propaganda
has been extended to the United

peace emissaries of Germany have
been active in several of the neutral

Count von PcrnstortT's suggestion
that an envoy be sent abroad to
look into the possibilities for peace
was conveved to Pres'r Wilson bv
'ec'y Irnsing. The American
president, seeing a possible chance
for a. service to humanity, decided
to act be the outcome what it
might. Accordingly Col. K. M.
House, the confidant of Pres't Wil
son, was summoned to the whito
house and a long conference was
held.
Col. House accepted the mission
ami immediately the United States!
embassies in London. Perlin and j
Paris were entrusted with the task
of arranging conferences with the
various foreign ministers and other
influential members of the govern
ment. It is belieed that Col. House did
r.ot see Ambassador on Hernstorff
before his departure for Kurope on
Dec. 2s last, but that all arrange
ments were made through .Sec'y

Count von Hernstorff was given
