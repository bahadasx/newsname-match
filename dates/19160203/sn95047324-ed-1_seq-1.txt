who will be present at the Tampa
convention, ihese people alone
represent 24 States of the Union
and one South American country.
I believe this will be the great
est convention ever held in this
State. When these hundreds of
people see what Florida has to
offer the farmer and stock raiser,
it will not be long when many
millions of dollars will be invest
ed in those industries.
No county in Florida caii af

campaign started with one hun
dred letters addressed to the var

dividuals and companies, and to
stock journals, in which letters
was set forth the advantages of
Florida as an agricultural and
stock raising state. I made the
statement that Florida could easi
ly he made to support ten million
head of cattle on her-ranges, and
' that the cattle should be finished
for slaughter at home. That it
was a crime to send the cattle
from the state to be finished for
the market, I also stated that
live-stock of all kinds could be
.raised as cheap in Forida as in
any country in the world, and I
am sure the claim is not over
To impress upon the people of

this question and the convention
as well, the following statement
of the work of the State Depart
ment of Agriculture is offered:
... During the month of December
alone, there were 1,550 packages
of matter mailed out of the Agri
cultural and Immigration Divis
ion of this Department. Of the
above 1,045 packages related to
live-stock production and kindred
subjects; '505 of these packages
covered general questions of ag
riculture and horticulture. These
x packages contained 13,950 pieces
of mail matter covering a little
more than 30,000 subjects.
Of the 1,550 packages above
referred to, 362 packages aggre

The Cattle Conference will be
held during the South Florida
Fair and Gasparilla Carnival. It
will be held under the joint aus

Says Richard H. Edmouds of the Manufacturers' Record Does not
Believe that There is Any Other State in the Union of Such
Potential Value fo the Country Speaks Specifiically of the
State's Varied Resources : and Many Advantages. .
The farmer's bargaining power
is not in proportion to his econo
mic "importance. The value of
last year's crops was more than
six billion dollars. Suppose that
one half, or even one third, of this
vast sum were mobilized, organiz
ed, for the farmer's benefit. What
advantages could it wield for
farmers in the markets, of the
country!
Some forms of economy are ex
pensive. One man can do about
twice as much plowing with a
two-horse, as he can with a one-
horse, plow. The same is true of
cultivating. A two-horse culti
vator will cover more land and do
it better, than some of the primi
tive implements that are used.

The Case of Mr. Bob White
The Friend of the Farmer
Mr. Bob White, of Everywhere,
after working faithfully all sum
mer in the farmers' fields and po-
tato patch 4s to rid them of boll
weevils and chinch-bugs, potato
bugs and noxious weeds, is now
hiding to save his life from the
greedy American hunter. ,
No more does he care to send
his clear, cheerful " bob-bob-whits"
across the sunny summer
fields to his working mates. The
feathered toilers who survive the
awful onslaught of stinging shot
and yelping dogs, as they run
hither and thither seeking some
place of safety, call but faintly
and tremulously to their frightcn
ed companions, "Quiet, quiet,
quiet."
In some states the greedy ones
are trying to declare a migratory
bird law recently passed '"uncon
stitutional." A few states still
have no state laws to protect their
game from being ruthlessly
slaughtered for market at any
and all times of the year.
The cow which has provided
food for your family through
long years, the horse which has
toiled for you many weary sea
sons, are tenderly cared for in
their old no-ft. But vour most
tireless and cheerful helpers, who
saved your crops that make food
and provide every comfort for
your family, that worked most
faithfully for what little they
could eat, now that they can no
longer serve you are left to starve
or to become the prey of their
enemies.
Mr. Farmer, however alluring
as an object .of sport or dainty
tit-bit he may be on the table, we
want to show you that Bob White
is worth ever so much more alive
and sheltered on your farm.
Protected, he will faithfully pa
trol your fields, capture and
make away with your worst foes,
including the devesting army
worm, cotton boll weevil, chinch
bug and the potato bug which
others of his kind scorn to touch.
He is a splendid ranger and raids
close to the ground for the noxi
ous weed seeds which form more
than half of his diet.
One Bob White was found
with 400 pig-weed seed concealed
about his person. Another, 500
seeds of ragweed. A third, in ad
dition to other food, had consum
ed 550 seeds of sheep-sorrel, while
a fourth had 640 seeds of pigeon
grass, and several had from 50 to
100 seeds of jewel wepd Everv
quail tenant which lives on the
farmer's land has been estimated
to be worth$25.00 to him. This
would make a dressed quail
weighing four ounces worth $6.25
an ounce. Aglow with life, hap
py m his good service to you, the
amount of good cheer and good
fortune this mascot of the field
will bring you cannot be estimat
ed in dollars and cents. We ask
you, Mr. Farmer, whether you
are going to permit so good a
friend to you to be hunted to
death or left a helpless prey to
the elements until he disappears
from the earth, as the last wild
pigeon has vanished ? Lida May

Richard II. Edmonds, editor
and general manager of the Man
ufacturers' Record, the well
known Southern development
publication, who is stopping for
a few days at the Tampa Bay,
gives out a most interesting in
terview upon "Florida." . He
says he thinks this state is the
nation's "greatest asset. "Mr. Ed
monds is psending1 the winter
here. He has a home in Dayton a.
It is one of the most interesting
impressions ever related to a
newspaper man, regarding this
state,and his quotations are print
ed in the following:
"Florida is one of the nation's
greatest assets.
"Taking all things into consid
eration I do not believe that there
is any other stato in the Union of
such potential value to the coun
try as Florida.
The resources of other sec
tions in coal or iron or timber or
water powers are duplicated else
where in-the country. There is
no other state so unique in its ad
vantages that there could not be
found, at least to a large extent,
a counterpart in some other state.
But as to Florida, this is not true.
This state '8 potentialities in every
respect entirely unlike those of
any other state in the Union,
make it of supreme importance
to the nation from many points
ot view. Considered from that
of climate alone it is of vast na
tional importance, for year after
year the. number of people who
seek in the balmy climate of Flor
ida rest, recreation and health
from the biting, blasting blizzards
of the North and West, will stead
ily increase.
Population on Increase
The lives of many thousands
ot people of great importance to
tne nation's business interests
will be lengthened or saved bv
visits to Florida. Ultimately the
population of this state, drawn
largely by climate, will run into
the millions.
"It is a trite saying that Flori
da will become the great winter
playground of the nation. But
Honda will be far more than
that. It will be to the tired bus
inoss man needing rest, a winter
haven where he can regain
strength and vitality for the
great burdens that every business
man must carry. It will at the
same time be for the man of mod
erate means, likewise a haven of
rest, for as Florida becomes more
and more developed, it will pro
vide to a larger extent that is now
conceivable, opportunities for the
man of moderate means as well
as for the poor man and the rich
man.
"In this state will be built up
one of the greatest civilizations of
the age, for here will commingle
active virile men from all sections
and all classes, united in the up
building of what is practically a
new or virgin territory, but hav
ing the diversity of thought and
education and ambition which is
essential to the highest develop
ment of a country.
'All that has been done in the
development of Florida is merely
the pioneering work of making
ready the way for the hundreds
of thousands who in the near fu
ture will seek this state as a per
manent or a winter home. The
movement is already under way
but only in its infancy.
"The country at large has not
yet waked up to a full ' realiza
tion of Florida's climatic advan
tages and of the superb beauty
spots to be found in so many parts
Of this state.
'As the playground and the
health and recreation center of
the country for winter, Florida
possesses advantages from the
national standpoint unlike those
of any other state. In this re
spect alone, if it had nothing but
climate on which to build, it
would be one of the nation's most
priceless assets, and this climate,
according to those who spend
their summers here, is relatively
as good in summer as ui winter.
But Florida has more than cli
mate ; it is the ono state in the U
nion which can produce the limit
less supply of oranges and grape
fruit and early vegetables so es
sential to the nation's welfare.
Pacific Coast Inferior

coast some of these fruits can be
produced, but the advantages of
the Pacific coast in this respect
are far inferior to those of Flori-1 pa Tribune.

railroads of the South, have nev
er yet fully grasped the possibili
ties of this section and never tak
en hold of it as seriously as C. P.
Huntington and Harriman and
others took hold of the develop
ment of the Pacific coast.
"Whenever Florida is adver
tised as broadly, as intelligently
and as comprehensively as the Pa

the population ot the nation. That
ilone tremendously adds to its
strategic value as the health and
pleasure resort of the land, as
well as the center of production

foodstuffs needed by the nation.
"From much of New England
and of the Central West it is pos
sible to reach Florida by one
night's travel and the journey has
no disadvantages or discomforts
On the other hand, a trip to Cali
fornia means at the best four or
five days' journey, much of it
through a desert of intolerable
discomfort to travelers, or
through ice-bound, , snow-covered
regions of the northern routes
"The advantages are altogeth
er m favor of Florida
In the early days the romance
of California s development and
the marvelous advertising of the
railroads turned the trend of pop
ulation that way and brought a
bout the great wealth of the Pa
cific coast.
Ludicrous Advertising Blunders
"On the other hand, in the ear
ly days of Florida's development,
railroads made many serious
blunders in advertising this state.
The literature of many Florida
roads at that time carried as the
most striking scenes, alligators,
negro babies and swamps. The
nation was made to believe that
theywere the chief Vrducts of
Honda and there are millions of
people in this country who still
have an idea that alligators roam
the public roads hunting negro
babies as their food, and that
swamps and malaria are every
where in evidence.
Twenty-five years ago I ap
pealed to some of the railroads
that were flooding the land with
this sort of literature to stop it
and pointed out the tremendous
injury they were doing the state.
.hariy impressions are very
lanting and so the early impres
sions of Florida given to the na
tion by this unwise advertising
has left its lasting influence for
evil which is only now being re
moved by the broader knowledge
that the nation is gaining as to
Florida and by the more intelli
gent advirtising that the railroads
of this state are doing.
"There is still room, however,
for advertising Florida to a far
greater extent than has ever been
done. The work of advertising
this state through the campaign
recently inaugurated by the Pres
ident of the Tampa Board of
Trade, will give to the people of
this state and to the railroad offi
cials an illustration of the power
of intelligent, well-handled ad
vertising through the great daily
papers and magazines of the
North and West in arousing inter
est in the charms and advantages
of this Heaven-favored land. But
not until Florida is advertised as
California has been advertised
will the country fully understand
this state of infinite resources
and matchless attractions.
Railroads Aid State
'"The Union Pacific Railroad
annually spends about $800,000 in
advertising, very largely of Cali
fornia. As compared with what
Southern roads expend for adver
tising purposes this amount is
staggeringly great. I do not be
lieve that it is so much the fault
of the officials of the Southern
roads that their expenditures are
so much smaller than those of
California roads, but it is because
of the dominant influence of the
great banking houses and finan-
might properly
have restricted his remarks to ap
ply to South Florida all that
portion of the 6tate south of Ced
ar Key and Gainesville on the
west coast and south of San ford
and Daytona on the east coast, for
that comprises the real Florida.
North of the points named, the
state has no tropical or semi-tropical
features, and it resembles
southern Georgia . and Alabama
more than it does southern Flori
da. The winter garden of Amer
ica is here in the south, particu
larly along the Gulf Coast, where
both climate and soil contribute
to the production throughout the
winters not only of all tropical
fruits, but of everything in the
vegetable line., A great advan
tage of this region is the artesian
water supply', which not only
adds to the health of the people.
but turnishes the most inexpen
sive means of irrigation, thereby
making certain the production of
the vegetable and fruit crops.-

Health Agencies Working
to Prolong Human Life
The United- States Public
Health Service and the various
health agencies of this country
are working to prolong the aver
age duration of life. In this they
are obeying the desire for exist
ence which is the strongest in
stinct of mankind. Only a small
proportion of the human race
rounds out its tour of duty on
this earth. , Some people are born
with good bodies which they
treat well. Barring accidents,
they live a long time. Some peo
ple are born with poor bodies
which they treat well. Barring
accidents, they can live to a ripe
old age. Some people are born
with good bodies which they treat
badly and some people are born
with poor bodies which they treat
badly. They don't last long.
It is recorded that in Yorkshire
in 1501, Henry Jenkins was born.
He died in 1670, cut off at the age
of 169. He remembered well the
battle of Flodden Field. This oc-
cured in 1513, when he was 12
years of age. The Register of
Chancery and other courts show
the administration of oaths to
him 140 years prior to his death,
lie gave deposition as witness
when he was 157. In his young
manhood, when he was a little ov
er luu, he was a remarKaoic

The term "old age" too fre
quently is another name for the
falling due of the debts of youth.
Over-eating, over-drinking, over

drafts on the bank of Nature

oning can be putff a little bit,
but Dame Nature will, not be
wheedled out of her claim.
The remarkable thing about
Henry Jenkins is the fact that he
has left behind him no rules of
living which would enable one to
duplicate his feat. In this he
showed great self-repression. As
a matter of fact, there is no royal
road to old age and it is not to bo
attained by a particular dietary
or regimen of life. Perhaps tho
best rule may be expressed in ono
word, "Moderation." Moderation
in food, moderation in drink,
moderation in the joys and wor
ries of life, moderation in work,
moderation in recreation, equani
mity of the mind, the soul and
the body. These make for long

Many people are probably not
aware of the fact that there are
more military pensioners in Flori

receive the sum of $1,027,368.89.
In seventy-two foreign countries,
4,642 persons drew pensions for
