The Nellie Byers Case
Topeka, Jan. 25. Dr. E. H.
Dallou, the Dodge City dentist,
displayed bis collection of teeth,
teeth marks, and other exhibits
m the Byers murder case to S.
M.- Bpewster, attorney general,
this-morning. He bad made a
set of teeth, mounted, for both
Archibald Sweet and Clint Hen
son. Then there was a little
oval-sbaped drumhead, on which
he has drawn a picture of teeth
marks on the body of Nellie By
ers, the murdered schoolteach
er. There are also a dozen wax
records, replicas of the teeth
marks on the body, and those
made on wax by Sweet and Hen
son. 'Teeth marks on a body art
not reliable," Dr. Callou explain
ed again to Brewster. "Look
here."" He took the little drum
head and stretched it. The po
sition of the teeth marks was all
distorted. After the marks
were made on a human body, he
explained, the flesh straightens
out and does not give an accurate
replica of the marks made.
- Summed up however, and ad
mitting that the teeth marks on
the body of the girl might be
used as evidence. Dr. Balicu
sized the situation upas follows:
The teeth marks could have
been made by Henson.
Henson has an alibi to pro.-e
be wasn't there when the mir
der was committed.
. The teeth marks could not
' have been made by Arehie Sweet.
Sweet bus admitted that he
was in the neighborhood when
the crime was committed.
I Measurements of footprints
I coincide with measurements of
Sweet's shoes. Sweet says Hen
son wore a pair of his (Sweet's)
I shoes that day. There you are.
j The case against Sweet, charged
(with murder, is set for the April
( term of the Grant county district
fVourt. Nellie Byers was murder
led October 22. and there is fear
I that Sweet may be lynched if
taken to Grant countv for trial.

A Coming Attraction
The big attraction that Mr
H. B. Phelps, manager of the
Meade opera house has secured
through the New York booking
offices is Wm. Wamshcrs merry
musical comedy, The New Wiz
ard of Wiseland Abroad with a
company of all stars from differ
ent musical shows. Among the
leading ones are: Mr. Karl Bow
ds, Mr. Bob Homberg, Mr.
Wilbur George, Miss Babe Lee,
Miss Katherine L. Hoeger, Miss
Clara Wayne, and Mtss Dorothy
Kussell. These are the princi
ples i:i this big lun show and to
gether with eight dashing young
ladies who take an important
part as chorus ladies it makes
The New Wizard of Wiseland
Abroad one of the best musical
comedies on the road this season.
This is the same company that
played the Home Theatre in
Hutchinson Kansas at $1.50 top
prices. Mr. Phelps has arrang
ed with Mr. Wamsher to cut bis
prices here in Meade to 50, 75,
and $1.00. Children 25 cents.
The Wizard of Wiseland goes
from Meade to Pratt, then to
Dodge City, then to Garden City
and then jumps in to Denver,
Colorado for a run of two weeks,
; so the theatre going people of
I Meade will have a chance so sel
;dom seen when they witness
The Wizard of Wiseland as they
will see a big city show on the
night of their . engagement in
Meade Saturday evening, Feb
ruary 12th.

Moles eat worms, not corn,
'according to Dr., R. K. Nabours,
zoologist of the Kansas State
Agricultural college. Because
moles make their runs along
rows ot freshly planted corn
and then tbe corn fails to come
up, it is the common belief that
the moles have eaten it and are
therefore responsible for the
poor stand of corn. The imme
diate responsibility, Doctor Na
bours points out, rests on the
i tbe mole'sguests-meadow mice
wmte footed held mice, and com-
i mon house mice. The mole runs
furnish concealment acd lines of

their own. It has been found by
experiment that moles eat ear'h
worms, grubs, insects, and other
animal life but vegetable matter
scarcely at ail. To avoid the
damage it is easier to kill the
moles than the mice, and thus
destroy the hues of traflic.
Trapping is the best means of
extermination

: Several have remarked "I
tho.ight all of them were already

as ol such high standing and so
faithful to duty that people take
for granted that you have been
enroled under the banner and
already wear the colors of King
Immanjte)! What could be finer
praise than that?
