vice that will not soon be forgot

bestowed upon it.
Here
M.msfield was entirely cut off
f Pom wire communication with
the outside world for a time this
week as a result of one of the
mo-.t disastrous storms which
has ever visited this section of
the O.'.a rks.
Following a long period of
rainy weather, intermingled with'
an occasional fall of sleet, a cold
wave set in and the telephone,
telegraph and electric light wires
were covered with an ever-in
creasing coaling of ic the weight
of which caused the fall of many
poles, bringing the wires down
in 'a tangled mass.
Early .Sunday morning condi
tions had reached the climax, and
the local exchange of the Mans-'field-Ava
Telephone Co, was put
out of business, as was also the
power plant of the Mansfield
Light & Power Co. The Western
Union Telegraph Co.and the rail
road and long distance telephone
connections were broken, so that
all means of wire communication
was brought to a sudden halt.
The weight of ice caused much
damage to orchard and shade
trees, some trees being uprooted
and many large limbs being bro
ken. The crash of falling limbs
could be heard throughout the
day Sunday, and it was danger
ous to be abroad. On this account
religious services were badly in
terfered with, and in some cases
were called oil'.
Lamps and candles were much
in demand and the old-fashioned
method of lighting was in vogue.
Some of the stores closed as
soon as darkness set in Monday
on account of no lights.
Passenger traffic over theFris
co was delayed.on account of the
wires being down and the block
system being out of commission,
and Signal Maintainer C.E. Cath
cart and his force of men.togeth
er with tne section me.i aud flag
men, had pienty to do in order
that the trains might use the
tracks in safety. Mr. Cathcart
had to keep his motor car on the
hum.
In some places the Frisco also
suffered fioin high water and
land slides.
As soon as the wires could be
connected once more with the
Frisco depot two more operators
were placed here, Mansfield be
ing temporarily made a 24 hour
telegraph station. Ed.Abbott of
Cedar Cap and Scott Whittaker
have been acting as telegraphers
in adoption to Station Agent G.S.
Burney, who is also local uiana
ger for the Western Union Tele
graph Co.
Mrs. F. E. Weed, manager of
tho telephone company.took per
sonal charge of the work of re
pitiring the 'phone lines and put
a force of men at work Monday
morning under the direction of
M. E. .Stephens, and they have
been busy clearing the streets of
wires and poles, and putting
things in shape. Service will be
restored as soon as possible.
T.L. PI u miner, manager of the
Ava exchange, came up with his
force of men and are assisting in
the work. He reports very slight
damage at Ava.
W. C. Coday, manager of the
iight plant, was busy early Mon
day morning will! a force of men
repairing the damage to the light
wires, and within 12 hours from
the lime the work began, lights
were again shining in soineof the
homes and places of business,
but it was later before others
were supplied with light. The
street lights will be put into ser
vice again as soon as possible.
The total loss from the storm
is estimated in the neighborhood
of $3,000, the Mansfield-Afa Tel
ephone Co. being the heaviest
loser. Our people sympathize
with Mfs. Weed in her loss, and
are giving her all the encourage
ment possible in the rebuilding
of the lines.
The streets nnd roads were in
many places rendered impassa
bl! by the wreckage,
The rural and star route mail
service was also badly impaired
on account of the condition of the
A Disastrous Storm
Our Lead and Zinc Mines
West of Mansfield a short dis
tance are to be found many lead
and zinc mines and prospects.
About a mile from town stands
a large crusher building where
formerly was separated the min
eral that was taken from several
deep shafts one on the north
side of the Frisco tracks and
three or four on the south. The
deepest of these shafts is 320 feet
About of a mile west of
these shafts is another shaft on
the Deaver tract of land. This
shaft is down about 180 feet. We
find here fine mineral all through
the rock; also, a pile of lead, zinc
and silicate that has never been
shipped. There seeais to be sev
eral tons of it on the ground
Just south of this shaft about
15 or 20 rods is G, S. Burney's
prospect, on what is called the
Jones land. Mr. Burney has
started a shaft on a fissure, and
is down about seven feet. He
encountered some fine ore sam
ples in going down, and at the
bottom a nice vein of zinc ore
sets in nearly an inch thick.
Here's hoping Mr. Burney goes
down on this shaft and develops
a rich mine.
Rufus Chandler wants it un
derstood that the name of his
mine is the Gulch Mine. He is
starting a tunnel and is drifting
in a northwesterly direction.
Frank Scheuermann is sinking
a shaft in his cellar this week to
encounter the tunnel. This tun
nel was worked last summer and
contains some fine lead ore mixed
with flint rock.
There are many more mines in
this vicinity, mention of which
we hope to make later

The last storm here of this na
ture before this one took place in
1906 and some say it was worse
than this years, while others
claim the opposite. Be that as
it may, both were quite disas
trous. L Leatherman of the Mansfield
Art Studio took several excellent
views of the storm's havoc.
In a conversation with Mayor
F.H. Riley he highly commended
Mrs. F.E Weed and W.C. Coday
for the way they took immediate
hold of the work of repairing the
damage wrought to the telephone
and electric light equipment.
The managers of Mansfield's
public utilities are ever striving
to give their patrons the best ser
vice possible. The doctor also
says that as soon os the ice dis
appears the work of cleaning up
the park will be begun. The
park trees were badly damaged
and will require considerable
work.
Much damage is also reported
at Hartville, Seymour and
Marshfield .
From Texhoma, Oklahoma
Texboma, Okla., Jan. 30, 1919
Editor Mirror:
Just received my paper. I al
ways get it on Snnday. Ia look
ing it over I find my name and
five of my children recorded on
the honor roll. This makes me
feel glad to know so many of my
family are subscribers to your
good paper, I take a great many
papers and consider the Mirror
among the best and newsiest of
them all. I thank J. A. for hia
liberality in donating the paper
to so many of his father's family.
I am prond of him as a son, also
as one who is doing much good
in training the minds of the
young in education. May his life
be long in the world and strewn
with flowers in the way of bless
ings. Texhoma is on the line of the
Rock Island railroad, also on the
line of the Oklahoma and Texas.
Most of the city is in Oklahoma.
The depot is built across the
state line. Texhoma's population
is 2,000, and it is" the best town
between Liberal, Kans., and Dal
hart, Texas. The Rock Island
has the longest stretchof straight
road bed by this place there is In
the West, it being 72 miles of
perfectly straight track. This
Panhandle country is very level
and is fast developing into an ag
ricultural country, wheat being
the principal crop. This winter
has been favorable for farm work
several small snows which fur
nish moisture to growing wheat.
There are a number of Mis so
unpeople in these parts, all do
ing well seemingly well satis
fied with the change from the
Ozarks to the Panhandle or plains
country. At this time there is a
snow on the ground one inch in
depth, which makes the farmers-
rejoice in the hope of another
bumper crop for 1916.
Wisuinglhe Mirror and all our
relatives and friends of Mansfield
and vicinity much happiness and
great prosperity through the en
tire year, I am yours for success
