r-:esdent 'Wilson nddrefsed three
larse audiences yesterday, two In To
r.ek.i and one last night in Kunsas
My.
The President put a dramatic climax
n his Kansas City speech. He led
he audience of 15.000 In singing
America." He promised to make the
navy of the United Slates drat In the
world,
The Chief F.xeeutlvo In the course
of his remarks made some of the
strongest declarations he has yet ut-
lered.
One that received the greatest ap
plause was that he will use the army
and navy of the United States as fol
lows: ,
To maintain the right of Americans
to travel on the high seas on legiti
mate errands.
To maintain the rights of citizens
to carry on unrestricted commerce
wltti neutral nations.
To sell food und
clothing to peuceful populations
wherever conditions ot war muke It
o.ible under rulcs'of international
law.
To maintain the Monroe Doctrine.
Again the President Jumped upon
the pacifists.
He asserted that he did nut have
enough soldiers to patrol the Mexi
can border. Unable to do many things
he should have done because of lack of
troops.
He paid tribute to the National
Guard, but said the total of 129.00U is
too small, and beside, they are under t
P ate control
The President asserted that the
I'M.teij States surprised the world by
hulling down the flag in Cuba. He
de. lared that it would do likewise in
He Philippines.

he had found it neces.ury to enter Into
In connection with securing the contract
made for this work between the city und

1 Senator Thompson declared last night
that he would rail every one who had
; anything to do with the signing of the
1 duul hystem contracts. The Senator said
, that he would certainly ask Mr. Shouts
to tell what was the exact naturo of
i the "commitments and obligations" re
ferred to and why It was necessary to
Incur them.
Gardner M. l.atie Is dead. The orig

Wasiiinoton, Peb. 2. Germany's final
nnswer to tile Anicilcan demands re
garding the I.Usilnula Is expected to
reach Washington to-morrow. Whether
the answer Is to lead to a fiarmnl settle,
mem or to a break In the diplomatic re
lations between the two Governments Is
expti'tcd to be known definitely nfter
'resilient Wilson returns to Wiishln-iiori
"n Prldiiy.
The general belief heie, though. Is that
Germany, having gradually yielded no
many Impoitniit points In the Lusltanlii
case, will ilnally bow to the United
States demands on the remaining differ
ences. German Unibitssy officials also
profess strong confidence that the new
memoi nudum will meet the wishes of the
United States.
State Department officials were greatly I
Interested In newspaper despatches this i
afternoon containing what purports to be
a semi-official announcement made In
Herlln. It says Germany admits that
the friendly exchanges between the two
Governments had failed to reach a mu
tually satisfactory adjustment ; but that
yesterday the Foreign offlte had trans
milled instructions to Count von Hrn
stniif "which give reasonable hope for a
positive understanding "
lltipe St-cll In lleslinlflien,
According to State I lepartiueut offi
cials, the memorandum which Secretary
Lansing hambsl to the Ambassador last
week was of such a character us to re
quire Germany to yield to such an ex
tent on all vital points as to make It
possible to continue the minor confiden
tial negotiations. It Is thought from the
exprtsslou of "reasonable hope" In the
Herlln announcement that the Foreign
Offlte may have adopted this course.
It Is assumed at the German I'.m
bass) that the new Instructions are
coming by cable. In which event If they
left Herlln )iMerda), as stated, Iney
-houM re., eh Washington before late to
night or tarl) to-morrow. In order that
the exchanges by cable between Count
von llernstorn and his Government
