E. M. Phillips, State High School In
spector Reports Inspection to
Board of Education.
ENROLLMENT NOT
FOR GOOD SCHOOL WORK
Suggests Adding Two Grade and One
High School Teacher to
Present Force.
Bemidji schools are overcrowded
the enrollment is not consistent with
effective school work and the teach
ers of the school are generally over
ciowded with work, in some cases
prohibited, according to E Phil
lips, state high school inspector, who
has written a letter to the Bemidji
Board ot Education
Here Last Week.
Mr Phillips recently examined
the schools in Bemidji and he pointed
out then in an interview with a Pio
neer iepresentative that the schools
were overcrowded and that some
imiedy should be taken
In Ins Ittter to the school board he
suggests that in order to take care
ot the schools according to estab
lished standards, there should be at
least two giade teachers and one high
school teachei added to the present
force
Visits All Schools.
His letter to the board of educa
tion is as follows:
"In connection with my inspection
visit at Bemidji last week, certain
conditions were noted to which I
wish to call the attention of the
hoard
"I visited all your school buildings
except the two-room building east of
tht. lake, and found each one full and
overflowing except the 'North' biuld
nig, which is level full
"In the old 'Central' building,
there are ten grade rooms, each one
enrolling, up to this time, between
torty-hve and fifty-five pupils Such
enrollment is not consistent with
ttective school work
"The high school building is also
veiy much crowded and no longer
makes it possible for you to house
your childien there without such a
degree of crowding as interferes with
good school management and efficient
school work
Teachers Overworked.
"I also found that the high school
teachers are generally overloaded
with classes in which the enrollments
are always large and in some instan
cfs piolnbited
In older to properlv care for your
schools, according to very well es
tablished standards, there is need of
your adding at least two grade teach
ei and one high school teacher to
your present toice This would be
impossible except as you provide more
building space than you have at
piesent (Signed)

ber company and the City of Crook
ston by Alex E. Arnold, Elizabeth C.

tion was dismissed without cost.

GET MONEY
Walker, Minn., Feb. 3.Attorney
Ed Rogers returned from Washing
ton, D. yesterday, where he has
been spending the past month as rep
resentative of the Chippewa tribes of

principal will be distributed among

told to about $1,500,000, or $150 to
every Chippewa Indian, man, woman
or child, enrolled. This item has

bill and agreed to by the committees

tive Clarence B. Miller of Minne
sota yesterday pleaded before con

the purpose of enforcing the regula

among the Indians in Minnesota. He
supported the proposition to appro
priate $200,000 for the purpose of
keeping liquor away from the In
dians. He said that $150,000 was
entirely inadequate. He advocated
having hundreds of Indian agents.
Representative Chipperfield yes
terday introduced a bill forbidding
the expenditure of funds for the sup
pression of liquor traffic. He did this
to limit the activities of the Indian
agents in Minnesota.

Dooley, Mont, Feb. 3 With its
coal supply exhausted two weeks ago,
with food supplies low, no flour, no

Dooley's population of three hundred
faced today a most desperate situa
tion.
Lumber is being used for fuel,
and with the lumber supply running
low, the citizens will use the stock
yards timber On homesteads farm
ers are burning oats, straw and hay.
No casualties have been reported
but people are becoming desperate as
continued blizzards prevent relief be
ing brought overland. There has
been no mail for three weeks. Today
it was clear and warmer for the first
time in weeks, but roads are drifted
so deep that attempts to get pro

THE EEAL QUESTION

Landed.
THE SITUATION
"The Appam is our prize,"
says Ambassador Bernstorff.
"She is ours," says British
Ambassador Rice.
"She is a prize alright, but
who's? It remains unsolved,"
says Secretary Lansing.
"Look at the treaty of 1828
providing that Germany and
the United States may bring
their prizes into each others'
ports," says Bernstorff.
"Yes, look at The Hague
convention of 1907 which
provides that prizes in neut
ral ports surrender to own
ers"
"You never ratified that,"
answers Bernstorff
"We will hold her for. a
while and see," says Lansing
Washington, Feb. 3 Secretary
Lansing today officially announced
that the British passenger liner Ap
pam brought into Hampton Roads by
a German prize crew will be held by
the United States to be a German
prize of war and not an auxiliary
cruiser.
Who is Owner?
The real point to be decided is
whether the Appam shall remain in
possession of the prize crew under
the terms of the Prussian-American
treaty, or shall be returned to her
British owners under The Hague con
vention. Indications were given that
the state department will hold that
the prize belongs to Germany.
Note From Bernstorff.
Count Von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, in a formal note to Sec
retary Lansing, gave notice that the
Appam came into Hampton Roads
under the treaty which guarantees
her to her captors. Sir Cecil Spring
Rice, the British ambassador, asked
that the ship be returned to her Brit
ish owners as a prize recovered un
der The Hague convention.
The Hague convention, under arti
cle 21, provides for the internment of
the crew and the surrender of the
ship, but state department officials
are doubtful that it can be applied to
the case of the Appam, first, because
the Prussian-American treaty is be
lieved to be binding and second, be
cause Great Britain signed, but never
ratified this particular Hague con
vention.
To Remain There.
Until the status of the ship is de
cided, she will remain in the custody
of Norfolk customs authorities and
if turned over to Germany may be
kept in port or sent to sea as the
German government chooses.
The state department today re
quested the customs authorities to
land all passengers and non-combat
ants. Their case now goes to the im
migration authorities. Foreign con
suls will care for their own nationals
who are indigent. Those who can
afford to do so are free to go to Bur
ope. Those who wish to remain in
the United States must comply with
the usual immigration regulations.
To Land Today.
Old Point Comfort, Va., Feb. 3.
Two hundred and forty-flve persons
held prisoners by a German prize
crew on the former British passenger
liner Appam were informed that they
were at liberty to land on American
soil.
More than 200 others, including
the German captors, the captain and
crew of the liner and certain passen
gers alleged to belong to the armed
forces of Great Britain, will be held
on board until the United States gov
ernment definitely determines their
status and that of the ship itself.
