The mystery surrounding the sea

LONDON, Feb. 3.—Survivors of the
British steamer Woodfield, sunk by a
submarine off the Moroccan coast, ar
rived here today with a story of a
bloody fight with the boat's crew.
The submarine, one of the newest
and speediest of the German under
sea boats, overhauled the Woodfield
after a short chase and sent out a
boarding party. The Woodfieid's crew
attacked the submariners as they
clambered upon the deck and en
gaged them In a knife and pistol duel.
The boat was unable to bring her
guns Into play for fear of killing her
own men. The hand to hand combat
on the Woodfieid's decks lasted for
three hours. The steamer's crew,
poorly armed, were finally overcome
after eight sailors had been killed and
fourteen wounded. They were put
into small boats and pulled for the
Moroccan coast. Their troubles did
not end when they reached land, they
said. A party of bandit Moors noticed
their approach and made them pris
oners. They were released after the
Woodfield bhipplng company of Lon
don, the vessel's owner, paid ransom.
The survivors were landed at Ply
mouth yesterday and reported to the
company's office today.

Staff Correspondent.]
BERLIN, (via wireless) Feb. 3.—
Capture of the British liner Appam,
bombardment of English. Industrial
towns and of Paris by* Zeppelins and
fresh activity of the Von Tlrpitz
boats, may be accepted as a prelude
to an aggressive campaign on the sea
and In the air against Germany's ene
mies.
Germany's sea and air forces may
perform even more startling feats, It
was hinted today.
News of the audacious feat of the
German sailors who captured the Ap
pam, was received with the greatest
enthusiasm here. Lieutenant Berge
and his crew have befcome the popu
lar heroes of Berlin.
Reports of the Appam's dash Into
Norfolk, received mostly frcm Eng
lish sources have supplanted all| oth
er items of news Interest, exceptln3
poslbly the Monday night Zeppelin
raid on England.
The marine authorities stated to
day that they know exaotly how each
of the seven British ships was sunk
hi the operations off the African
coast, but they do not desire to give
out the information at this time, the
admiralty awaiting reports from
Washington as to whether the Appam
entered Norfolk as an auxiliary cruis
er or as a prize, pointing out that the
case will be handled differently by
the United States If the latter decis
ion is made. Offloials believe the Ap
pam is a German prize and expect to
begin negotiations with America un
der this assumption, unless Washing
ton's investigation disproves this
theory.
The Monday night Zeppelin raid on
England, according to English re
ports, the greatest air attack of the
war, may be considered as only the
beginning of a great air campaign.
Germany plans with her Zeppelins to
destroy everything of military Import
ance or of food value in England as
long as England co«|tfnUea. her policy
of starving Germany. Officials here
declare, too, that it Is impossible for
Germany to consent to any new regu
lations on submarine warfare in the
future, as long as England persists in
this starvation policy.
Zeppelin raids on England have
been impossible for several months
because of the air currents. Present
weather conditions, aeronautic ex
perts declare are ideal. According to
Zeppelin commanders, Monday night's
raid on England accomplished one of
its chief objects, the destruction of
grain elevators at Liverpool. Zeppe

attention to Liverpool, because a

[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON Feb. 3—The Brit
ish liner Appam held by a German
prize crew at Newport News, Is a
German "lawful prize of war"—tem
porarily at least.
Internment of the twenty-two Ger
mans of the prize crew aboard the
Appam appears to be required. Wheth
er the twenty German prisoners, found
on the Appam and impressed into
service by the prize crew, shall be
Interned, was more doubtful. These
Germans are said not to be military
or naval reservists, but German citi
zens taken from Africa to British de
tention camps.
Demands for release of the 140
odd members of the Appam's crew
have been made. It is expected that
they will be released although Lieu
tenant Berge contends that by resist
ing capture they identified them
selves with naval service. Captain
Harrison, however, denies his ship
made any resistance. The dozen
British army and navy men aboard
the Appam cannot be held as prison

whether they are subject to intern
