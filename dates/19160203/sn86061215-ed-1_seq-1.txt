APPAM CASE 10
PROVE STICKLER
Novel Phase of Neutrality
Presents Itself With
Captured Steamer
INTERN OR RETURN
IS THE QUESTION
Britons Claim Ownership
Germans Insist Boat
Is Prize of War
l^ondon, Feb. 2.—It I* under,
sto ^l here that the Appam carried
BOOAVO pounds sterling in bullion
jpr which probably will be claimed as
^. a prize, as bullion Is contraband.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 2. State
department officials Indicated today
that if the Appam finally is held to be
a prize the Prussian-American treaty
of 1828 is more likely to govern the
case than The Hague convention. This
would mean that the Appam would be
turned over to her German captors and
in that case some German officials ex
pressed the view that the prize crew,
rather than let her fall back into the
hands of the British, as would seem
inevitable if she left port, might take
the ship to the three mile limit and
sink her.
In case she is held to have become a
German fleet auxiliary, she will have
the choice of leaving port after a cer
tain time for supplies or repairs or in
terning for the war, as have the Prinz
Eltel Friedrich and the Kronprinz
Wilhelm.
Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the British
ambassador, formally asked Secretary
Lansing for the release of the Appam
American treaty. The secretary took
the ambassador's argument under con
sideration.
"Moewe" Ship of Mystery.
British officials here scout the theory
Kiel canal under Swedish colors and
got out into the Atlantic. They have
a theory she is a German merchant
man which got out of an Azores port
nearly a year ago and has been mis»
lng since.
Collector Hamilton's report, which
was placed before the neutrality board
any coal or provisions beyond food as
is necessary for the crew and prison
ers aboard for a short ^me.
Berge himself, the collector says,
considers the Appam a prize and not
a naval auxiliary. Mr. Hamilton thinks
that some other armed merchant ship
probably a little larger and faster than
the Moewe made the capture and 6ank
the seven merchantmen off the West
African coast. He reported that Lieut.
Berge would not reveal the name of
the ship, but said It was clear that a
submarine was not responsible for the
capture.
One factor which must be weighed
by the neutrality board is that several
of the Englishmen on the Appam were
gun tenders on the merchantmen
which fought the unknown commerce
raider before they submitted. Whether
they must be released is one of the
state department problems.
PRISONERS CL08ELY WATCHED.
Old Point Comfort, Va., Feb. 2.—
The British South African liner Ap
pam was riding at anchor In Hampton
roads today awaiting disposition by
the United States government of the
claim of the German naval reserve
officer in command that she Is a prize
of war.
1
It 1B expected that the status of the
vessel will be determined during the
day and that she will be moved to
either Norfolk or Newport News
where the British subjects comprising
the greater number of the- 452 per
sons aboard will be permitted to dis
embark. Probably most of them will
take immediate steps to secure pas
sage for Liverpool, where the Appam
was bound when she was captured by
the German raider Moewe on Janu
flve days out from Dakar,
West Africa.
[ans Berge, the stocky Ger
sr who brought the Appam
Atlantic from a point near
the Canary islands with a prize crew
of twenty-two men, waited further in
structions from Custom Collector
Hamilton, who ordered the ship kept
at Old Point pending action in Wash
ington.
The veil of silence by which he kept
the stories of his prisoners aboard
the Appam from the public yesterday
was still drawn over the vessel, and
armed German seamen kept close
watch that none should come aboard
except those with proper authority.

150,000 Turks, are likely to begin
an attack on the Franco-British
forces at Saloniki about February
15.
Berlin, Feb. 2. Rumors have been
circulated here that the Zeppelin raid
on England Monday night was in re
prisal for the Baralong affair but The
Associated Press correspondent is as
sured in authoritative quarters that
the attack did not come under that
head.
It is stated that the midland section
of England was selected for the raid
because it is the center of the muni
tions industry and because Liverpool
is the center of England's commerce
and that there was a purpose to bring
home to the people of Germany the
fact that the boasted defenses of Lon
don do not avail against Germany's
aircraft. It was intended also to inter
fere with the preparations being made
in England for the carrying on of the
British operations in France and Flan
ders.
The admiralty office reiterates that
not a single one of the raiding Zeppe
lins was injured.

ATTACK JUSTIFIED.
Berlin, Feb. 2.—The Lokal Anzeig
er publishes an editorial today on the
Zeppelin raid over England, saying
that everyone will be convinced that
military significance. It asserts that
Liverpool, which the German admir
alty announced was bombarded, is to
be considered as a port of entry of
American ammunition "whose de
struction is our sacred duty."
FLOODS 8TOP ADVANCE.
London, Feb. 2.—A Reuter dispatch
from Delhi transmits an official state
ment issued there regarding the light
ing in Mesopotamia, saying:
"Gen. Aylmer's forces hold a strong
position on the river Tigris. The
recent floods have hindered and made
a forward movement impracticable.
"Gen. Sir John E. Nixon who has
handed over the command of the
British forces in Mesopotamia to
Lieut. Gen. Sir Percy Lake, will start
homeward within a shor{. time."
RUSSIANS CLAIM GAINS.
London, Feb. 2.—Around Riga there
have been several Infantry engage
ments in which the Russians claim to
have worsted the Germans. There has
also been artillery fighting on this
front.
On the Austro-Italian front the
Italians repulsed the Austrlans In a
single infantry attack.
The Russians are still pursuing the
•Jurks around Lake Tortum in the
Caucasus, according to the report from
Petrograd.
On the western front in Flanders the
British and Germans were engaged
along the river Somme in an artillery
duel. In an official report the Ger
mans claim to have captured "some
British." The British report says the
capture consisted of five men, of whom
two escaped. The French and Germans
have engaged in artillery engagements
without decisive results.
TEXTILES SEIZED.
London, Feb. 2.—According to Ber
lin newspapers as quoted by Router's
Amsterdam correspondent, a new
order was put into force on Feb. 1,
under which the greater part of all
products of the textile industry was

The Tageblatt says it is highly sig
nificant that on this occasion the gov
ernment does not seize the raw mater
ial but finished articles.

the royal flying corps, died today as a
result of injuries sustained at Alder

MID-WEST FOR
President Finds This Part
of the Country Is Not
on Pacifists Side
KANSAS CAPITAL
GIVES HIM WELCOME
Wilson to Start on Return
to Washington Tour Is
Held Big Success
Topeka, Kan., Feb. 2. —President
Wilson reached Topeka, the turning
point of his middle western tour, at
10:10 a. m. today. He was greeted
with a salute of twenty-one guns and
escorted by state troops to the resi
dence of Gov. Capper, whose guest he
was until 1 o'clock when he addressed
an audience in the auditorium.
The president and Mrs. Wilson rode
over snow packed streets in zero
weather in open automobiles. A crowd
cheered them at the station, but most
of the city's 60,000 population lined
the sidewalks along the way to the
governor's residence.
American flags had been distributed
in advance to the crowds along the
way. Schools held no sessions and the
state house employes were given a dky
off. The city employes had a half
holiday.
Gov. Capper, a republican, who is
not in accord with the administration
preparedness program, introducing the
president to the 6,000 persons gathered
in the municipal auditorium, praised
him for keeping the United States out
of war and added that "many of us are
not in accord with the program of v»st
armament." He continued:
•"We welcome the fullest discussion.
The president had spoken for peace, as
we would speak for it. He has stead
fastly keep us out of the terrible con
flict in Europe. He has sat undismay
ed on the hottest lid that has sea.tyjfl.1
any president' since Lincoln" What
ever our opinions In regard to arma
ment. this day we Kansans, all, are
for President Wilson and for Mrs.
Wilson, too."
Suffragists Balked.
Suffrage leaders who had planned to
see the president to obtain his en
dorsement of a constitutional amend
ment enfranchising women, apparently
were balked by his going to Gov. Cap
per's home from the station.
"We cannot invade the governor's
home, of course," said Miss Mabel Ver
non, the representative of the Wo
men's Congressional union. "There
isn't a thing for us to do. The door
seems locked against us everywhere."
Gets Noisy Welcome.
Lawrence, Kan., Feb. 2. In spite
of zero weather, Lawrence gave Presi
dent Wilson the noisiest reception of
his trip when he arrived here at 9:20
a. m. today.
Half of the 13,000 people of the
town were at the station. Students
from Kansas university sang and gave
their yells and a band played patriotic
airs.
PLEASED WITH IOWA.
Des Moines, Feb. 2.—"Do you want
the situation to be such that all the
president can do is to write messages
and utter words, of protest?'' asked
President Wilson here last night, in
advocating preparedness before one of
the largest audiences of his present
trip.
"If these breaches of international
law," he continued, "which are in daily
danger of occurring, should touch the
very honor of the United States—do
you wish to do nothing about it? Do
you wish to have all the world say
that the flag of the United States that
we have can be stained with impunity?
Why, to ask the question is to answer
it.
"I know there is not a man or wom
an within the hearing of my voice who
would #ish for peace at the expense
of the honor of the United States."
Applause Is Generous.
The president's address was punc
tuated with thunderous applause. He
spoke slowly and gravely, with em
phatic gestures to enforce his words.
His declaration that the-United States
wanted peace drew a quick response
and his assertion that the self-respect
of the nation must be preserved elicit
ed another great demonstration. A
throng of 8,000 persons cheered him to
the echo.
The president declared he was try
ing to weigh carefully every word he
said. He reiterated that he had been
daily charged to keep the country out
of war and also to uphold its honor.
"And many, a night, when it has
seemed impossible for me to sleep," he
said, "because of the apparently inex
tricable difficulties into which our in
ternational relations were drifting, I
have said to myself, 'I wonder if the
people of the United States fully
know what that mandate means to
me.' And then sleep has come, be
cause I knew that there was not a
community in America that would not
stand behind me in maintaining the
honor of the United States.

that time it had beeln impossible to
adjust the Lusitanla case In a man
ner satisfactory to both sides by
friendly verbal exchanges of views.
On Tuesday Instructions were trans

American embassy at Berlin, which,
at the instruction of the state depart

POLICE TOLD OF
LIOUORJALES
Affidavits Made in Court
Charge Three Men With
Selling Whisky
rRIO ARRESTED IN
FIGHT EARLY TODAY
Bert Brown, Lew Fuller and
Blanche Mills Figure in
All Night Brawl
The police department broke up a
little fight early this morning that re
sulted in getting two affidavits In
police court, one against H. Splwak
and the other against A1 Dyer and
Dennis Maloney for selling whisky.
Officers Llghtner and Kapp were call
ed to the home of Lew Fuller on Bast
Main street about 1 o'clock this morn
ing where they arrested Bert Brown,
Lew Fuller and Blanche Wills for dis
turbing the peace.
Fuller said the-fight was caused by
Brown who wanted to see Blanche
after he had forbidden him. This
morning Fuller made an affidavit
stating that he had purchased during
the past six months from one to three
pints of whisky a week from H. Spl
wak, paying $1 a pint. Blanche Mills
then made an affidavit that In the past
month she has pnrchased about six
pints of whisky from Dennis Maloney
and about twelve pints from Al Dyer
in the last two months. She said that
she has spent about |200 with each
of the men.
Brown was asked if he was willing
to make an affidavit but he said that
he had not purchased any liquor In
Ottumwa. The trio was fined $25 and
costs each. Blanche Mills wanted to
leave town and was allowed her lib
erty. Fuller arranged to pay his fine
and Brown was committed to Jail.
COL. HOUSE HELD
MOST DISCREET MAN
Paris, Feb. 2.—The Paris press com
ments on the discretion of Col. EL M.
House, which Is described as being
impenetrable and admirable.
The Excelsior publishes an article
on Col. House and uses, as an illustrtu
tion for it, a composite photograph ofi
the colonel and the sphinx. It heads
the article, "A sphinx in a soft hat."
It says that the most experienced in
terviewers admit that Mr. Wilson's en
voy has baffled them as they had
never before been baffled.
A. Fltzmaurice, the foreign editor of
the Figaro, says:
"As Colonel House has only visited
the capitals of the belligerent nations
most directly interested In the ques
tions of the blockade and submarine
warfare, one would not be far wrong
in believing that those questions form
the principal object of his Journey.
That he did not go to Vienna and that
he is in a hurry to return to America
may be due to the fact that the Lusi
tanla situation has been growing more
acute."
SULTAN HONORED
BY GERMAN RULER
London, Feb. 2.—A dispatch from
Constantinople transmitted by the

says that Emperor William in an auto

"Your majesty's troops have proved
themselves worthy of the old. military
glory. They have accomplished deeds

and recently by a victorious attack
they repulsed the enemy in the Irak
district.
"Reviewing the great events that
have happened during my past life I
recall today, on my birthday, the
splendid performances of the Turkish
army, and, wishing to express my ap
preciation and close friendly relations
which personally connects with your
majesty's hour, I beg you to accept
the dignity of afield marshal In my
