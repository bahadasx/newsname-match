IRS SOCIETY OF
EQUITY MEET AT K. C
REPORTS FROM MANY STATES
SHOW AN IMMENSE GROWTH
IN BUSINESS THE PAST YEAR
The annual convention of the Far
.mers Society of Equity held in Kansas
City on December 14 and 15- was
thoroughly representative of the spirit
of real co-operation, and the unbound
ed enthusiasm and earnestness of the
delegates present was reflected in the
splendid work which was accomplished.
Over 1600 votes were represented
in the meeting, and due to the pres
sure of extra work the covention held
the better part of four days. Head
quarters for the meeting were estcb
lished in room four of the Muclebach
hotel. Forenoon, afternoon and night
seessions were necessary in order to
f Inibh the work for which the delegates
had assembled.
The report of accomplishment by
districts was an energetic endorsement
of the Equity plan in full.
L. H. Brechman, A. H. Gretchen and
President Bettermen of the Parkers
Prairie, Minn, organization developed
the xact that over half a million dollars
business was done in thoir district the
past year. They are thoroughly es
tablished and have gotten on a jobbing
basis for considerable of their business
being especially the salt distributers
for their territory. They handled in
their territory over 700 cars of cattle
and hogs. Other commodities claim
a large share of the tremendous bus
iness done.
E. M. Sweitzer of the Pennsylvania
district reported an immense handling
of fertilizer in carlots, also wheat
buck'-hest ,flmir, mill products, coal,
potatoes, fruits implements, machinery
twine, sacks, etc., and stated that
Pennsylvania is alive with the Equity
Bpirit and ripe everywhere for organ
- ization. Pennsylvania's business
reached into the hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
Frank Metcalf, representing the
Oneida Farmers Union, one of the
largest Equity districts of southern
Idaho, reported the large success of his
section, in handling grain especially.
They have a modern elevator plant
costing $17,000, and were successful
in paying their stockholders 10 per
cent on capital stock, and four per
cent to the members in proportion to
the business done by each with their
corporation during the year. The lat
ter is a trade or patronage dividend
and depends wholly upon the volume
of business the past year.
. Tho intermoutitain district has 30
siich cVaring houses with the central
power and control vested in the Cen
tral Clearing house at Pocatello, Idaho.
David Holmgren, of Tremonton,
Utah, reportad the same largo meas
ure of success in the Ubih district, es
pecially in the matter of handling lum
ber, coal, general farm supplies etc.
The farmers in their district have
gained sueh a degree .of strength that
they are forcing the great sugar com
praros to an agreement which is abso
lutely satisfactory to tho greatest com-
' bnations of capital in tho world, which
fact reflects te greater credit upon
' the ability' of the equity farmers to
gain such concessions.
L. F. Yoder, representing the West
ern Idaho- Eastern Oregon district,
reported a gross business of over $600,
000. They have attained signal suc
cess in marketing hogs especially. Mr.
Yoder stated that their chief'concern
is to educate their farmers to sell their
hogs on consignment, taking a com
mission sales account as a basis for fi
nal sttlement. In litis manner the
shipper gets all the profits over and
above the actual handling cost. They
have also handled huge quantities of
grain and have made the best poultry
market in the west by insisting upon
their members shipping only the best
and getting the top of the market in
return for them. Mr. Yoder's district
is in the heart of the fruit belt, but
the total loss of the fruit by frost this
year prohibited them from reaching
the $700,000 mark in business trans
acted this year. -'
II. Danforth of Missoula, Mont.,
made an extended report of the condi
tions in his territory. . They have
made a good showing considering the
ewness of that district and are ex
pecting to conduct a campaign for
. eapltal stock
a few weeks ndei
the direction of National Organizer,:
H. G. Morris. All delegates were ser
tainly convinced that our Montana!
district bids fair to become one of our
largest and best districts, and Mr.
Danforth's report was received en
thusiastically. J. A. McCune, manager of the UN
ION COUNTY, N. M., Clearing house
W. H. Lindaey and L. H. Morrison,
president and county delegate respect
ively, reported the facts concerning
the business in their district, which
was a distinct surprise to the con
vention. Union County surely got a
large place on the Equity map. They
were unable to state in dollars and
cents what the volume of business was
for the year, but not a delegate pres
ent doubted that New Mexico ulti
mately will be one of the greatest
Equity districts in the United States.
Broomcorn, maize, Kaffir and Pinto
Mexican beans are their chief crops,
and the margin they . have received
through the Equity over the old scale
of prices has set the farmers on fire
for the principles of the organization.
They gained over three cents a pound
on beans and as high as $25 per ton
more for broomcorn. These delegates
gave an excellent report of the work
of the National Organizer in their
territory.
The Oklahoma delegation was ably
represented by J. E. Henson, of Shaw
nee, who gave some very timely and
interesting reports on the benefits of
the Equity in their district. He told
how the National Organizer worked
with their farmers for six weeks in
May and June and expressed the desire
that theNational headguarters would
send Mr. Morris back to their district
as soon as possible in order that they
may become incorporated nad get on a
business basis akin to the other very
sucessful Equity districts. Arrange
ments were virtually made to comply
with Mr. Henson's request, and Mr.
Morris expects to go to Shawnee about
the first week inFebruary. Mr. Hen
son told of how their farmers netted
over $5.00 a ton for their watermelons
and$ 11.00 to $25.00 per bale for cot
ton more than was offered by the deal
ers. He stated that their crops had
been excellent, especially cotton, and
that their farmers are now ready to in
corporate and sell shares of stock tq
finance their organization.
Miss Jeanette Rankin of Montana,
congress-woman, elect had her proto
type in the Equity convention in the
person of Mrs.Harrison Danforth. Mrs.
Danforth was our only lady delegate
aside from our national secretary
treasurer, Mrs. M. A. Boyd. Mrs.
Danforth expects to aid materially in
the stock campaign soon to be conduct-
ed in Montana by the National Organ-
izer, and will make a specialty of tak -
ing the ladies' memberships.
C. B. Lezier of . the great Gulf
Coast Equity district was absent, but
a letter from him to H. G. Morris was
read to the convention in which he
extended felicitations and gave his
promise for full support of the work of
the convention. His district last year
did over $1,000,000 business, over half
of which was in tomatoes clone. Mr.
Lozier spends several weeks on the
large markets each year, and his bus-
iness is mostly in perishable products ganizer for tho ensuing year,
requiring extreme care in handling. By unanimous consent of the conven
A. Y. Satterfield and Allon Roche, tion & waB decided to adopt the Roch
manager and secretary, respectively, ; dale system of co-operation, so suc
of the intermountain district were un- cessful in Great Britain, as the future
able to be present on account of the I Dasis of operation, and to that end
pressure of business, but communica-
tions from them were read by David
Holmgren. Both expressed regrets
that they were unable to participate
in the atfairs of the convention, and
extended their best wishes for a suc
cessful meeting, promising support of
the work done by the assembled del
egates. Their district has built sever
al new modern elevators this year
and despite the hard business condi
tions they expect the most successful
year of all when they issue their an
nual report in February. , They have
expended over $42,0Q0 in new proper
ties and have handled hundreds of cars
of grain, hay twine, sacks implements,
machinery, potatoes, fruits and other
commodities. The Pocatello Central
Clearing House is incorporated and
capitalized at$150,000.
The national organization is repre-
lentated in 28 states, and other dis
tricts have accomplished great things,
but an extended notice of all in detail
is prohibited by lacli of space, and

tedious task comprising two weeks
time, has been very carefuly done and

give each and every child the best
that could be given them. vWe are al
