WILSON PAV tS WAY FOR PEACE NEGOTIATIONS
INQUIRIES NUMEROUS AT LOCAL
LAND OFFICE FOR THE EN
LARGED HOMESTEADS.
PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE IS NEEDED
The local United States land of
fice Is already beseiged with prospec
tive homesteaders who are determined
to become land owners upon the sig
nature of the 640-acre grazing home
stead bill by President Wilson, which
is expected at any time. The bill has
passed both house, as already stated
in these columns, and now needs only
to be signed by the president to make
~ - ....... .... ..................
it operative. Filings can then be made
without delay, the classification to be
determined later.
Expectations are for quit a rush of
filings as soon as the lands will be
open to this new law.
Even at present business is not at
all quiet at the local government of
fice, which deals with* the public do
main. In fact, new filings of various
kinds, proofs and contests are of daily
occurrence.
But with the operation of the graz
ing homestead law there will be re
newed activity. There are still many
thousands of acres of public lands left
in this district, which will come under
the new classification. Much of this
land will now pass into private owner
ship and the result should be an im
petus to stock development.
Residence according to the home
stead laws and the expenditure of
$1.25 per acre in permanent improve
ments, such as fencying, is required
by the so-called 640-acre law.
ROUNDUP BOOSTER HERE.
H. M. Robinson, secretary of the
Roundup Commercial club was in Lew

tion. Mr. Robinson represents one
of the live towns of the central part
of Montana and is a live wire himself.
While here Mr. Robinson interviewed
the county commissioners on the pos
sibility of securing their assistance
in the building of a state highway

REPLY TO
GERMANY
Great Britain's Answer
May Be Made Public
Before Christmas.
TO LEAVE DOOR OPEN
]
LONDON, Dec. 20.—(9:21 p. m.)
There is a strong probability that i
Great Britain's note in reply to the
German peace proposal will be made!
public before Christmas. This was In
the opinion in well informed govern- j
merit circles today where it is also
believed the reply will be brief and
will likely follow the lines of Mr.
Lloyd George's maiden speech as
prime minister insofar as it will leave
the door open for Germany to make
concrete peace proposals.
Great Britain's official reply to Ger
many, as prominent officials preferred
to term it, will be dispatched simul
taneously with that of her allies. Ever
since the German note was handed to
the foreign office by the American
ambassador it has been the subject
of discussions between Premier Lloyd
George and his cabinet council which
meets daily. The note and the nature
of the reply also have been discussed
with Great Britain's allies and it is
stated that these conversations have
progressed so rapidly that prelimi
nary drafts have already been made.
It would therefore not be surpris
ing if the allies' replies were ready
by the end of the week. Especially,
it is said, would this be true in the
case ot Great Britain's note when the
prime minister is declared to be anx
ious to dispatch without delay.
When the terms of the note are
definitely agreed upon and the docu
ment is signed by Lord Robert Cecil,
who is acting foreign secretary in the
absence of Mr. Balfour, it may be
handed to Ambassador Page with the
request that he forward it to the
state department at Washington for
transmission to Germany. This is
said to be the most likely method, in
asmuch as the United States repre
sents the allies' interests in Germany.
It is iust possible, however, that Great
Britain may decide to dispatch the
reply direct to the British ambassador
at Washington with instructions to

ATION SAYS SO AND PASSES
SET OF RESOLUTIONS.
LEGISLATORS ARE URGED TO ACT
At the annual banquet and talkfest
of the Fergus County Bar association
held last Monday at the Fergus hotel,
resolutions were unanimously adopted
urging the representatives in both
houses of'the"*state''leg'lfilature, from !
this county,' to exert thei7best"efforis ,
to secure the passage of enactments |
giving the Tenth Judicial district a j
to add To more

second judge, and to add two more
rt of this
state. * Several members presented |
conclusive arguments showing the j
wisdom and necessity for such action. I
Upwards of thirty attorneys and
several invited guests, including theiwar
representatives-elect from this county, t
were seated about the banquet table
when the serving began.
Following the feasting, President R.
von Tobel, who acted as chairman,
called upon the first speaker, William
M. Blackford, who referred to the
report of the legislative committee,
which was comprised of Mr. Black
ford, H. L. DeKalb and Alfred Blais
dell. The report as presented by Mr.
DeKalb aroused a storm of discussion.
It was finally referred back to the
committee to report at a meeting of
the bar to be held in this city on De
cember 29. The purpose was to in
corporate suggestions made during
the discussion and to allow all mem
bers to come forward with further
ideas.

NEW CONTESTS FILED.
In the local United States land of
fice Monday A1 V. Field of Winnett
brought a contest against the home
stead entry of Fred Homelen of Glen
Falls, N. Y., alleging abandonment.
] The land is located in 30-13-28. An
filed
,
i other contest was filed by Joseph
E. Summers of Roy against John W.
Schermerhorn, abandonment being the
allegation. This land is located in
j 6-15-28. Homer E. Geis of Winnett is
attorney for Mr. Field and J. W. Bar'
ker of this city is attorney for
Summers.
Additional Judges.
The resolution introduced by Mr.
Blackford stated that as it was the
belief of the association that an ad
ditional judge was imperatively need
ed in this district, the senator and
representatives from this county be
urged to help procure the necessary
legislation to secure such judge. This
and the recommendation for two more
judges on the state supreme bench
were the important developments of
the evening.
Shop talk was intermingled with
material of a lighter vein in the
speeches that followed. A number
of entertaining reminiscences of jus
tice as It was administered or mal
administered in earlier days in Mon
tana proved delightful, and the even
ing was one of merriment.
Judge Roy E. Ayers. E. K. Cheadle,
J. 0. Huntoon, E. C. Russel, J. E.
Wasson, E. G. Worden and O. W. Bel
den were called upon for responses
to toasts. Each had selected his
own subject, according to Chairman
von Tobel, and for that reason each
had something worth while to relate.
Mr. Wasson suggested that the Fer
gus county delegation use its influ
ence to have Montana divided into
two congressional districts, for rea
sons that are apparent.
SHIS GOOD DUDS HAVE A VITAL
EFFECT ON VALUE OF FAHIH LANDS
I
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.—The eco
nomic value of good roads was empha
sized today by speakers before the
annual convention of the American j
Civic association. I
Herbert Quick of the federal farm
loan board, explaining the relation be
tween improved highways and farm I
land values, said an efficient system ■
of country roads was cheaper and !
more valuable to the farmer than so- j
called tap line railroads spurs which
be constructed for less than
$75,000 a mile and the cost of which
must be paid by the communities they
serve
"Good roads have a vital effect on
the value of farm land," said Mr.
Quick. "If our board and country
banks are to loan money on farms
they must know the producing value
of the mortgage element and here is
where the value of good roads be
comes manifest."
Prof. Frank A. Waugh, of the Mas
sachusetts Agriclutural college and
last !
engineering, urged improvements and j
beautification of the country's roads. j
Prof. Albert D. Taylor of Ohio State
university outlined the relationship of
the landscape architect to country
planning.
j J. Horace McFarland of Harrisburg,
Pa., president of the association, in
: his annual address tonight declared
1 the war in Europe indirectly had been
responsible for civic advancement In
1 the United States. The horrors of
war, he said, had Impressed on the
American people their civic responsi
bility and their duties towards their
j fellow men.
The subject of national parks was
] presented tonight by H. B. Marshall
of Washington; Herbert W. Gleason
of Boston, and Enos Mills of Colo

Wholly without notice and entirely
contrary to what administration offi
cials have described as his course, the
president last night dispatched the
notes to all the belligerents and to
all the neutrals for their information.
This latest development In the rap
idly moving world events toward a
discussion of peace was not permitted
to become known until tonight when
the notes were well on their way to
the American ambassadors in the bel
ligerent capitals and probably already
in the hands of some of them.
It was a most distinct surprise to
ail official Washington, which had
been led to believe that with the for
mal transmittal of the proposals of
the central powers the officers of the
United States would await further
moves between the belligerents them
selves and that certainly, In view of
the speech of Premier Lloyd George
and the announcements in Russia and
France and Italy, further action by
neutrals would depend upon the next
careful and delicate moves of the bel
ligerents.
The whole tenor of official opinion
throughout Washington, when the
president's action became known, was
that it immeasurably Improved the
prospects for some sort of exchanges
looking toward an approach to peace
discussions between the belligerents,
without Impairing the position of the
United States should they finally he
unable to find a ground upon which
to approach one another.
At the White House no statement
whatever could be obtained as to
whether any of the powers even had
intimated how they would receive the
note, and there was every indication
that the same careful secrecy, which
prevented anything whatever becom
ing known about the president's action
until it had been taken, would sur
round any of the succeeding moves
British officials declared they were
utterly taken by surprise, were whol
ly unable to explain It, and were em
phatic in their statement that no ex
changes whatever had passed through
the embassy here as a preliminary
The wish and hope of the German
powers that President Wilson would
Intercede In some way has long been
tainly until recently In official ad
| vices to the American government, has
been that a peace offer by the United
I States would be considered almost the
next thing to unfriendly.
All that, however, was before the
German allies, of their own accord,
brought forward their proposals for
discussion of peace. President Wilson
specifically says in the notes he is
somewhat embarrassed in making the

The German embassy view, consist
ently hopeful that proposals of the
central allies would lead to a discus- j
sion of peace, was expressed in this
authorized statement by Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador.
"Now," said he, "I am perfectly con
vinced that there will be a confer
ence."
The nearest parallel in world his
had been assured his proposal would
not be disagreeable to either of the .
belligerents, and curiously enough, it :
was through Emperior William of Ger I
many that the preliminary soundings
crystallized into the suggestion that
President Roosevelt take the steps. j
' Those in official circles who would
discuss the notes thought It worthy
of attention that President Wilson,
after saying his action had long been
in mind, added: "The president can
only beg that his suggestion be con
sidered entirely on its own merits, and
as If It had been made in other cir
cumstances."

0 f „ conference, t
tore, to clear awa>
On Monday the higher officials of the
state department were taken into the
president's confidence uml the text
was sent to the public printer to make
copies for the diplomatic corps. The
fact that the lioto was completed not
later than Monday and its dispatch
Tuesday, indicate that It was sent re
gardless of anything that Lloyd Goorge
might say.
Officials expect the note to bo re
ceived with general favor In Germany,
but many believe the real test will
come with its arrival In the entente
countries, where many influential per
sons have feared and nought, to pre
vent any American Intervention until
the military situation changed. From
Jhe fact, however, that Lloyd George's
reply to the central powers was milder
than generally had been expected and
still loft the way open for further ne
gotiations, it is believed that the allies
will meet the present note In at least
a friendly Bpirit..
While Gorman officials thoroughly
understood that President Wilson
mado It clear that he wus not in any
sense offering mediation to the wnr
rimr governments, it was declared
that should the negotiations reach
that stage Germany, being anxious to
have (lie peace of Europe restored
willingly would agree to such pro
cedure. Neither does it make any dif
ference to Germany, it was said,
whether the conference is composed
of representatives of all the bolllger
e.nts or just, tile coalitions.
So far as Germany Is concerned the
view held here is that she would he
perfectly willing that a committee of
three, formed of a representative of
the central powers, a representative
of the entente and a representative
of the United Statos should hold pre
liminary discussions. The main idea
of Germany and her allies is te got
each set of belligerents Into direct i
personal communication with tho
other. Tile method is considered of
secondary importance.
Tho view prevails in German quart
ers that, all the belligerents will make
some definite statement in reply to
the United States. The very plmrse
ology of the American communica
tion, it is felt, calls for replies far
more definite than mere acknowledg
ments of receipt.
Bernstorff discuss
powers
Count von Bernstorff may discuss
the situation witli secretary Landsing
some time tomorrow.
The notes to ttic belligerents are i
prefaced with the instruction of Sec-,
rotary Lansing to tho Ameircan am
bassadors presenting them:
"The president directs me to semi
you the following communication to
lie presented immediately to tho min
ister of foreign affairs of tho govern
ment to which you arc accredited."
The texts of the notes themselves
then begin, identically as follows:
"Tlie president of the United States
has instructed me to suggest to the
(here is inserted a designation of the
government addressed), ft course of
action with regard to tlie present war,
which lie hopes that tlie government
will take under consideration as sug
gested in the most friendly spirit and
as coming not only from a friend, but
also as coming from tlie representa
tive of a neutrul nation whose inter
ests have been most seriously affected
by tho war and whose concern for its
early conclusion arises out of a mani
fest necessity to determine how best
to safeguard those Interests if the war
is to continue."
At this point the texts vary. In tlie
notes to the central powers this para
graph follows next:
"The suggestion which 1 am In
structed to make tlie president lias
long had it in mind to offer. He is
somewhat embarrassed to offer it at
this particular time because it may
now seem to have been prompted by

It has, in fact, been in
_
no way suggested by them in its ori
gin and the president would have de
layed offering it until those overtures
had been Independently answered, hut
for the fact that it also concerns tlie
question of peace, and may best be
considered in connection with other
proposals which have the same end in
view. The president can only beg
that his suggestion he considered en
tirely on its own merits, and as if it
had been made In other circum
stances."

Theory of Marketing.
At the Sherman house, in Chicago,
the philosophy of marketing farm
products at the least, expense, so iih
to benefit both the producer and con
sinner, was the subject carefully dis
cussed. College professors, hankers
and political economy experts parti
clpated, and the theory of farm-prod
uct. marketing was very thoroughly
threshed out. The sentiment was for
the elimination of useless middlemen,
although to entirely eliminate the mid
dleman does not seem practical or pos
Hilda.
Cheaper Products.
The sentiment among the consum
ers of the east is, of course, for cheap
products," said Mr. White to
Democrat representative. "Just
how this can lie brought about was
considered at the Chicago meeting
The reasons for the high cost of farm
products can he readily ascertained.
It is so evident to the traveler that
enHt of St. Paul sheep, liogs and cat
tie are not nearly as plentiful aH for
merly. it iH the shortage of livestock
and farm produce of all kinds, togetli
or with tho war demands, that Inn
brought on the present condition. Bad
crops have been a factor in the short
ago of grains. To overcome the con
sequent high prices tho east Is talking
of the embargo on farm products. This
does not meet with approval among
farmers, who say that tlio world mar
kot Ib thus taken away from them,
and that this Is not right. Their an
swer Is for some of tho city people to
go onto the farm lo go to work and
help IncrOuMi *; e production."
Equity Meeting.
Ill St. Paul, Mr. White attended the
Equity Exchange gathering, lining one
of the three delegates from Montana
Mr. While was invited to speak for
this state, and lie was prominent at
the convention, making one of the
notable address. Professor Wilson of
Bozeman and W. L. Beers of Great

gathes.
Country Is Prosperous.
Mr. White vlstod Boston, New York

Thrilled at Big Game.
It was Mr. White's good fortune to
witness the Army-Navy football game
at tho Polo grounds in New York,
when over 50,000 people wore madly
rooting for tills side or the other. It
wuh a thrilling spectacle, and Mr.
White enjoyed it very much.
Big Acreage Sowed.
Speaking of the Buffalo section, Mr.
White says that the heavy snow is
a good thing for the farmer. A larger
acreage of winter wheat was put In
the ground this fall than a yonr ugo,
and conditions are very good
MURDER MYSTERY DEVELOPS
IN DEATH OF HOMESTEADER
Word was received in this city yes
terday of the mysterious death near
Ityegate of a homesteader named An
derson. I-ato Thursday night his body
was found, half covered with snow,
near the outskirts of the little Mussel
shell town. A bullet wound, Indicat
ing that the man was shot from be
hind. was discovered, the course of
I lie bullet being through the back and
chest.
Together with two companions An
derson came to Ryegate about a week
ago from South Dakota to establish
residence on his homestead. How
ever, the trio stayed around town for
a few days and seemed in no hurry to
get away. Anderson was last seen
alive Saturday. His companions left
about that time, one for Broadview
and the other for South Dakota. Both
have been apprehended in an effort
to gain same information concerning
the man's death. Anderson was a
young fellow and unmarried. His body
was accidentally discovered by a Rye
gate man who was out hunting jack
rabbits. The officers of Roundup are
working on the mystery.

CRASH IN
MAMTS
AH War and Semi-War
Shares Drop From 5
to 72 Points.
WHEAT DROPS ALSO
NEW YORK, Dec. 20.—laisses of 5.
10 and 15 points for many stocks and
a 72-point drop for Bethlehem Steel
accompanied today's further sweeping
liquidation of stocks. Bethlehem
Steel fell to 500, a decline of exactly
200 points from its maximum of the
previous mouth.
Kails ngalus proved the only not
able exception to the general rever
sal. which took in virtually all war
and semi-war shares. Shipping stocks
were most seriously affected on the
notice served by England's prime min
ister yesterday that it is intended to
exercise supreme control over all ves
sels Hying the British flag.
Peace developments were again
made tlie ostensible weapon to bring
about further price recessions, which
not only effaced most gains of recent
months, hut sont some stocks down to
levels of a year ago.
A more powerful factor was found,
however, in the tremendous pressure
exerted by professional traders, now
largely committed to the boar or short
side of the market. This clique has
operated extensively ever since Ger
many's peace overtures became known.
Another powerful influence in the
direction of lower prices was that
wielded by leading financial Interests,
which continued to call loans and
mark down all but seasoned stocks of
fered as collateral, to the increased
embarrassment of brokers and their
clients, the latter being in turn forced
to strengthen impaired margins or
sell out.
According to board room gossip,
heaviest losses of the past week have
been sustained by a group of western
and southwestern operators, who took
the market out of the hands of local
professionals a few months ago.
Today's more extensive extreme re
cessions. in addition to the setback in
Bethlehem Steel, were: Mercantile
Marine 16 points, with 7 for the com
mon; Atlantic, Gulf & West Indies,
15; South Porto Rico sugar, 10; Amer
ican Beet Sugar, 6%; Utah Copper,
5 3-4; American zinc, 7; Central
Leather, 6 3-4; Sloss Sheffield Steel,
7; Crucible Steel, 5 3-4; Lackawanna
Steel, 6%; American Locomotive,
4 3-4, and as much for Pressed Steel
Car.
Despite these adverse service con
ditions, general news of the day indi
cated a continuance of the long sus
tained prosperity aside from reported
price concessions In copper.
