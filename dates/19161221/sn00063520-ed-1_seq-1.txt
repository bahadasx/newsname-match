What Is Ontario's Great
est Need In Your Opinion?
Get a Cannery Says Rancher
What Ontario needs most is cniinin"; fac
tory (r MM kind.
Tlierc is no nar. "ryinjr, to hrinji ranchers here
with the expectation that they can make a living
off fniit unless there is a market for what they
raise.
Soft fruits and apples cannot he sold to good
advantage as soon as they are ripe ami there is
an awful lot of waste, ami that means tin loss of
what might he th ranchers' profit if it could be
marketed.
Then a canning factory would not only help
the fruit rancher but it would help the city by
giving employment to many citizens duriiiL: the
tanning season. My adding a cold storage su
tion to the canniaag plant the rancher would be
certain that the crop which could DOi be earlj
disHtsed of could.be held until the market would
he favorable,
There is plenty of land here t" supply 1 1 -needed
crops for Both these institutions, ami
since they would aid both the rancher and tin
city they should he secured. They are Ontario's
greatest need at this time.
