The Woman's Club met at the
home of Mrs. H. C. Williams on
Friday afternoon with almost a
full membership and seven vis

their appreciation to the young

During the past three weeks
trips over the county have dis
closed the fact that winter plow
ing is making good progress
VVhile the area plowed at this
time in individual fields is not
necessarily large, it shows that
the right idea is being incorpor
ated by the farmers. Practically
ninety per cent of the people in
terviewed had either begun plow
ing or were planning to do so in
the very near future. This
statement hold as true in the
Spanish-American districts of
the foothills as it does through
out the central portion of the
valley.
Tractors are beginning to play
an interesting part in the pro
gram of fall and winter plowing.
Several purchases of machines
have been made recently, with
the sole idea of putting them to
this use.
Our labor problem is getting to
be acute. It seems to be impos
sible to get men to assist in plow
ing the large areas which will go
in next year's crops.
Most of the conditions for
plowing are ideal, and permit of
unusually deep plowing, where
necessary horse power is avail
able dn the farm. Judging from
various conversations with farm
ers, the idea tit what constitutes
deep plowing in this county is
not very well st tt l- d. In some
instances 4 to 6 inches was called
deep plowing; in other instances,
6 to 8 inches seems to be the
proper definition. Our plan is to
recommend plowing to a depth
of about 7 inches, with a gradual
increase in future seasons. This
furnishes the basis for good win
ter storage of moisture, by offer
ing the necessary capacity. Some
writers contend that the amount
of moisture which can be stored
in the ground is practically pro
portionate to the depth of plow
ing; that is, in a given season, a
4-inch plowing would store only
one-half as much moisture as is
stored in ground when plowed to
a depth of 8 inches. While we
do not claim that this statement
is altogether true, it is at least
worthy of consideration. Un
doubtedly larger amounts of
moisture can be stored in deeply
plowed ground than in shallow
plowed ground. If we are to
seriously consider our next year's
interest, we must necessarily pro
vide as early as possible for our
moisture. There is nothing par
ticularly new about this state
ment, though the benefits to be
derived from its application are
sometimes overlooked.
The manner in which deep
plowing furnishes more storage
capacity for moisture is found in
the following: When the soil is
turned deeply and left in the
rough state, it is more susceptible
to fully thawing after a freeze,
because of the deeper penetra
tion of warm air, and the freer
circulation of the same. Thus it
it will be seen, that at the time
our winter snows melt, the
moisture is able to penetrate the
spaces and crevices and become
absorbed, thereby bringing evap
oration to the minimum. The
snow fall is likewise less subject
to blowing, and is held in the
field where it can accomplish the
most good.
Contrast this method with the
method now practiced by some
of our farmers, who leave the
field as it remains after harvest
until warm weather opens in the
spring. Upon the hrst serious
drop in temperature the ground
freezes. .Being protected by a
thin blanket of more or less loose
dry soil, it remains in a frozen
state throughout the winter.
Following snow fall, when the
melting period arrives, we notice
that instead of penetrating the
soil, this moisture penetrates
only to the frozen earth under
the blanket, and thereafter forms
into a vapor cloud as it evapor
ates from the puddles of water
on the surface, or is drawn up
through the now compact blanket
through capillary attraction We
lose moat if it. Unless the
period of warm weather lasts for
some time, the light snows have
to all practical purposes, done us
no good. On such fields blowing
and drifting is decidedly evident.
Aside from the matter of the
conservation of moisture, plow
ing through the fall and winter
months is very advantageous.
The weathering of the soil in
this manner makes more avail
able plant food. In fact, this
weathering is the chief factor in
the formation of plant food. Also
the humus, which rests principal
ly in the upper few inches of soil.
is distributed to a greater depth
and deeper root growth is con
sequently encouraged. Any lit-
Iter which may cover the field is
placed in such position that it
may readily rot and add material
ly to the plant food in the soil
Vegetable matter left on the sur
face of the ground oxidizes read
ily, and to a certain extent its
most, useful elements are lost to
the plant world.
The matter of insect control
furnishes a very desirable object
for fall and winter plowing.
This is a preventative measure,
and as most of us have come to
realize, it is the true attitude to
have in combatting insect pests.
The first thing to do, where pos
sible, is to eliminate the trouble
through prevention. This is the
cheapest and most satisfactory
course to follow. The cure is of
necessity of secondary impor
tance. This phase of the ques-1
tion has been previously dis-
cussed and should be well under
stood. Our losses from the cut
worm during the last two years
should furnish a most conclusive
argument fur fall and winter
plowing.
The one objection most com
monly met in advocating fall
and winter plowing is that, in
the opinion of some, more blow
ing of the soil in the spring is
likely to occur. This opinion is
Hardly likely to be borne out in
experience. We can find yery
little justification of the same by
talking to men who have had fall
plowing experience, either here
Per elsewhere. Assuming that
the spring work be the same in
either case, it seems unreason
able to believe that the fields
which now rémain with the loose
mulch on the surface, which was
left by the last cultivation and
harvesting of crops, can be sub
ject to less blowing than the
fields which have been fall
plowed and left in' the rough.
Weathering of the soil on the
smooth fields also takes place,
and we find the light loose par
ticles of earth which are respon
sible for filling up about our
fences and roads where obstruc
tion is offered, when the spring
winds blow. Even at present
clouds of dust are noticeable
from these fields, while the fall
plowed fields are at rest.
Fall and winter plowing is now
practiced in practically every
successful district where crops
are grown under our conditions.
It seems most likely that our ad
vances along these lines have
been retarded rather by the lack
of horse power and funds than a
sincere question of the principles
involved.
To the new comer this subject
is important, and should receive
earnest consideration. If this
statement of the case is ques
tioned, it is suggested that the
people most successful and ex
perienced be closely questioned
before the matter is passed. In
vestigation will bear out the
shove. Roland Harwell, County
Agricultural Agent.
