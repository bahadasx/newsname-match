Ancient History affords excellent

training of the historic imagination.
The students absorbed all the informa
tion they could And aDd then repro
duced it as though they had lived in
that time. The following was handed
in by Dernice Evans, being a captive
Persian's letter to a friend after the
battle of Flataea, in which the Persians
were defeated.
Dear Datis:
Ob, how sad and cheerless this world
seems after the terrible massacre of
yesterday, and the vanishing of the last
hope of ever conquering the small but
valient country of Greece. Closing my
eyes, a vivid and weird picture comes
directly before me. The little town of j
Plataea nestled in a valley underneath
a clear, peaceful sky presenting a
striking contrast to the field of fierce
soldiery, with our glittering helmets
and spears as we rushed madly down
upon the foe. With a clash we came
together and immediately all became
confusion and riot as we swayed
back and forth, each gaining a little
ground and then losing it in turn. Our
brave leader, Mardonius, shouted words
of encouragement until we renewed our
efforts, fighting like demons, and slowly
before our triumphant eyes, the Greeks
retreated. Ob, what a glorious shout
went up when we thought we had won
the day. What glad songs and feasts
were prepared that night in honor of
our victory. Victory indeed I What a
bitter mockery it now sounds to my
ears. I now see our mistake which
proved instrumental in turning the
tables: we were over confident in our
strength and supremacy, while we under-estimated
the worth of the Greeks.
The next day (that day that will go
down in history as the mo6t disastrous
to Persia) we immediately attacked the
Greeks, confidently expecting to put
them to utter rout , but to our amazed
disappointment they held their ground
fighting only as people can who have a
great issue at stake. We kept up hope
until our noble Mardonius fell, but with
our leader gone we almost knew our
fate. Our camps wre broken into and
our men slaughtered like Bheep in a
fold, with only a few escaping. 1 seem
to be a little more fortunate than my
brothers for although I am held cap
tive, I am nobly treated.
You will never know the awf ulness
of the battle nor the hardships we en
dured in striving for the victory that
we longed for, yet if our defeat had to
be, we are only too fortunate in being
conquered by Greece, the very heart
and soul of which is Athens, whom
everyone of us cannot help but admire.
Hoping soon to be free and tell you
more fully the story, I remain
Your captive friend,
Parthens.

BATTLE CRY OF PEACE
Greatest War Drama Ever Seen -16,000
Cuardsmen In Pictures
"The Battle Cry of Peace" is modell
ed principally after Hudson Maxim's
book, "Defenseless America, but there
is a substantial vein of romance and a
strong human interest story running
thru it. It's author is J. Stuart Black
ston, who received many suggestions
as to the scenario from a number of
army and navy ofiicers and oflicials of
the Federal Government who were glad
to co-operate in its making. An or
chestra of twenty-live musicians had
been engaged as part of the production,
the whole being staged and arranged
by S. L. Ilotbapfel. The pictures were
made under the direction of Wilfrid
North.
In the same category with "The
Birth of a Nation," "The Battle Cry of
Peace" is a spectacular offering, bring
ing home to the general public some
astounding facts concerning the un
preparedness of this country in time of
war.
Some idea of the size of the offeriug
is gained when it is said that in support
of the company there was introduced
16,000 National Guardsmen, 800 G. A.
H. members, 5,000 horses and seventeen
aeroplanes with zeppelins, seaplanes,
submarines, dreadnoughts, battleships,
torpedo boats and armoured motor
cars. It was taken for granted that all
the above mentioned material was
used in picture, according to an an
nouncement of the producers, although
it was not at all apparent during the
progress of the picture.
This mammoth production will be
shown at the Princess Theatre Christ
mas day, afternoon and evening.
