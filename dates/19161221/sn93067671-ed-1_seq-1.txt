SCHOOL HOUSE BURNED
Incendiary Fire at Oolenoy-A
Serious Cutting Scrape
Oolenoy, Dec. 18.-Last Thursday
night at 3.30 o'clock the Oolenoy school
building was burned. There seems to
be no doubt but that the origin of the
fire was incendiary, as on Tuesday night
before an attempt was made to destroy
it.
The building was a two-story struc
ture, the top story being used by the
Woodmen of the World. The loss, all
told, was approximately $2,000. Insur
ance of $1,000 was carried.
The citizens of this usually peaceable
and law-abiding community are very
deeply aroused over this affair-the
destruction of this public institution
which has meant so much to this people.
They were proud of their school and
of their building. Besides an educa
tional it was al so a social center
for. the school entertainments, the ban
quets, the picnics, club meetings, etc.
Little wonder that everyone felt a per
sonal loss and resentment wOhen, in the
darkness of the night, beneath a leaden
sky. the guilty one accomplished this
dark deed.
Another serious affair happened 'ues
day night at Freeian's lumber mill on
the stroud piac-. some miles from here,
when Siilney McJuIinkin, member of a
vell-to-do family of this section, was
seriously cut hy a negro. The exact
cause of the trouble has not been stated.
Blows were firstexchanged and the negro
left, but soon returned with a knife and
inflicted nine wounds in the body of
young McJunkin, who finally ran some
distance with the knife sticking in his
back. Medical aid was at once sum
moned and the injured man is expected
to recover. "Gent" Brock, the negre
who did the cutting, was arrested at his
home near Daeuaville by Ollicers Roark
and LaBoon and is in the county jail.
The condition of Mrs. .1. 1). M. Keiti
is quite erious. Mi. and Mrs. 10
Keith of' Greenville and Mr. and Mrs.
Earl Keith of Pihkens were with her foi
f'or the week-end.
From Mt. Carmel
We are ail very hu'y just now on thi

crops at good prices and no bloody wai
to devastate our fair land.
We hear of a good many changes tha
are being made for another year. 0

1916, at the Presbyterian manse, Liber

J. Brackens and Miss Lillian Merrell.
Willlaihs-LaBoon.-On December 17,
1916, at the Presbyterian manse, Liber
ty, by Rev. John C. Bailey, Mr. Ray
mon Williams and Miss Lassie LaBoon,
daughter of Mrs. William LaBoon.
Married, at Salem, on Saturday, De
cember 9, Miss Eulii Head and E. F.
Freeman. Mr. Freeman is a sonof Mr.
and Mrs. J. M. Freeman, of Pickens,
and is a well-known and highly respect
ed young man. The bride is the eldest
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George Head
of the Flat Shoals section of Oconee,
and is one of the county's most popular
young ladies. The young couple have
the good wishes of a host of friends in
Oconee and Pickens. The marriage cei
emony was performed by Magistrate P1.
L. Green.-Keowee Courier.
Gilstrap-Perritt.-Last Sunday, the
17.th inst., about 1 )). in., the vehicles
began coming, some from the ast and
some from the west. and twice t'.:.t nianny
f rom the north. fly 3 p. i. there was
such a crowd at the residence of J.
Alonzo Brown that he began to wonder
whether it was a prayer meeting in
vogue or whether they had congregated
to help him and his better half celebrate
theile sixth wedding anniversary, but
when the latter thought presented itself
he then began to look around for baskets
and seeing none realized that was not
the object; at least he thought so on his
part, for he knew he could never feed
such a crowd by himself andovheat
bread $9.00 a barrel and corn bread $1.40
a bushel, saying nothing about the
shortening, etc. Well, our curiosity by
this time began to get stirred up, when
Mr) John W. Gilstrap) of Liberty route
3 and Miss Artie Perritt of Central
route 2 appe'ared at the doo'r and were
invited in, when'the former handed tie
olliciating officer a long envelope w'hich
looked very much like an express pack
age. After opening it slowly but care
fully we found that its content.; gave
Mr. Gilstrap the right to take unto him
self al lielimiate, provided he saw hi)
- way clear to forsake all other sweet
hearts for her and to support her if corn
was 81.150 a bushel. Aifter taking the
I. above oath His Honor pronounced them;
- man and wife, and now it is Mr. and
I Mrs. Gilstrap. The bridegroom is the
seventh son of Mi and Mrs. E 0. Gil
strap of Liberty, while the bride is the
t only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. ). A.
f Perritt of Central route 2. The happy
young couple have the congratulations
of their many friends. B.

Says Liberty Wants County Seat
- A member of the staff of the Green
1 ville News went to Liberty last week
and wrote the following story foir his
l paper:
, iberty, Dec. 13. -A movement thiit
is being talked of considerably hero is
- the effort that may be imade to remove
the county seat from Piekens to Liberty.
For the tine being no steps can be
taken as the outcome of the Williams
ton county proposition1 may alter some
whalt the tentative plans. Should \Vil
liamston fa;il to scure the new county,
(fort1 vi will be madIe to :Innex a orti m
of AIldersonl cout y to Pickens. In the
event of ihs -nexatiot carryia
i. exlpc)ted it will, LUberty will titen he
thc ceinter and thv logical plhe for the
court hou11 .
While. of cIure it is expected that
Pickens will, put uip a spirited fight to
maintain the court house, Libert y ex
pects to enter the fight to win. It is
'said t hatI a larg.: portion of persons
around Easlev favonr the removal and
would so express themselves iift~ iven
- the opportunity. Others be tween' here
andl iikens arc equally dis::atIisfied,
contending that the present county seat
is too greatly isolated to be conivenien~t.
As the election has been ordered on
.the new Williamston countyv, the pro.
muoters of the remiovail idiei arel( quietly
uaaiting toe result before announcine;
their plans). However, th1ey arec far
from iniactiv~e and wvillI tackl Iche prop
ositioni with vimn when thme time isdmeeim
ed proper.

. . J. C.'Garrett
A gloom that can never be forgotten
was cast over this section when it be
came known Friday evening, December
16, that Mr. J. C Garrett had breathed
his last at his home in Norris. Mr.
Garrett had only been sick since Tues
day night, and while 'was very sick no
one thought the end was so near until
the day he died. He died from con
gestion of the brain. The deceased
was a leading citizen of not only his
town and county, but was prominent all
aver the state. He was a member and
deacon of the Norris Baptist church.
Mr. G.arrett was a great factor in his
community, always ready and willing to
advise and console when it was nee ded.
Hie never turned the needy away empty
handed or without cheer when it lay in
his power to help them. Being left
without a father when quite young, and
As he often reniarked, had to plow an
ix to make bread, he knew what it was
to he in need. By hard work and good
anage lent ie accumulated some of
this yorlfs goods. being worth at the
time ot' his death, forty or fifty thous
mcd dolhIcs. lie and his ron, Thomas
"arrett:zid son-in-law, E. C. M cWhor
ter, had just recently installed a seven
thousand (1llar ginnery at Norris and
were doing a good business. Besides
they dealt in fertiizer, real estate an(d
cotton. Being just fifty seven years of
age and a mani of good health up to just
a few days before his death and seeing
him around Norris as of ten as the writer
saw and talked with him makes it sad
der to the writer to now pass his place
of business and not see him. M any were
the consoling words the deceased has
spoken to the writer when the road
looked rugged to us in our helpless con
dition trying to make a support,'and
not only did he console us by his friend
ly words, but did what he could to help
us get a job to follow to make bread
for ourself, wife and little children.
Truthfully we can stand and while we
drop a tear on his grave and can say a
friend is gone.
The detessed leaves a wife and four'
children, nairiy: Thoimas Garrett,
Mrs. E. C. MeW horter and Mrs. C. C.
Burroughs of' Norris, and Mrs. It, T.
lall umi o1' Pickens, besides scores of
friends to Inourn his denth. le was
buried at Six Mile the (lay following
his death, Revs J. L. Willis and W. C.
Seaborn conducting the fuineral services.
