NUMBER 100 PER CENT GREATER
AT CLOSE OF FISCAL YEAR
THAN IN 1914.
Bismarck, Spedal.—During the first
year of the present biennial period, the
North Dakota railroad commisdon li
censed 1,969 grain devators and re-r.
ceived in fees from this source $22,
230.10. Of the whole, number,. 227
were farmers' elector companies and
there were 219 co-operative and Equi
ty .devators, the latter class having
shown a gain of almost 100 per cent
oyer the total for the proceeding two
years, which was 108.
At the close of the first fiscal year
of the present period, 797 "line" eleva
tors were operating in North Dakota
and there were 543 independent ele
vators.
The commission reports that the
number of elevator companies con
trolled by farmers show a decided in
crease this year.
Many Being Organized.
A large number of companies of this
nature are now in course of organiza
tion. As a rule, the commission finds,
the fanflers are conducting thdr bun

that the eariy future will find in thdr.

ports that better business methods are
becoming general.
The commission in its annual report'"
again calls the attention of our legis

There is no Way, the commisdon
states, to prevent the overissue of

the bond. In every case a failure of

"Fortunately," says the board, "by
prompt and energetic action $49,000
of such losses have been collected
from the bond companies and other
sources without cost to the farmers
or to the sureties for court or other
proceedings."
The commisdon reports that it has
prohibited the practice of issuing
storage certificates as collateral for
loans. '"H
