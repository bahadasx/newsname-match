Mrs Belle Blakely and Miss Essie
1 Blakely informally entertained a
number of friends Tuesday evening
of last week from 8:00 to 11:00
o'clock in honor of Miss Jimmie Britton.
For about two hours the guests
were employed in making poinsettias
|| to be used as decorations at the
K Britton-Wa.son wedding this after~
noon. A delicious salad course, followed
by cake and wine, was served
by Miss Madge Blakely. Among
those present were: Misses Ora McFall
of Pick* is, Jimmie Britton, Lula
Brockington, Florence Jacobs,
Messrs J D O'Bryan, Harry Britton,
Cecil Jacobs, D M Montgomery, and
Robert Purdy of Sumter.
Last Friday evening at 8 o'clock
Miss Jimmie Britton was the surprised
hostess of a miscellaneous
kitchen shower at her home on Ashton
avenue. Promptly at 7:30 a host
of fun-loving friends gathered at the
ijr home of Mr and Mrs W W Hollidav
?r on Acaueiny sireta preparatory to
^ going en masse to Miss Britton's.
Each guest was armed with a kitchen
utensil varying from a kettle to
a meat fork. Upon arriving at Miss
Britton's home they gave an imitation
of a 50-piece band, judging
from the noise of the clashing pots,
pans, spoons, et cetera. After the
hostess had recovered from the
shock the guests were invited in,
* and began merry-making in earnest.
One thoughtful guest had provided
an abundance of applesand nuts of
every description, which all present
enjoyed immensely. After many oldfashioned
games and a few delightful
recitations by Miss Willouise
Cunningham,the crowd departed and
left Miss Britton the happy owner of
many serviceable gifts of aluminum,
agateware and tin.

Christmas decorations, consisting !
of garlands, holly wreaths and fesroons
of smilax, prevailed through-1.
out the rooms, the entire lower floor
being thrown into one. Christmas:
candles and red-shaded lights lent a 1
soft glow to the scene. The dining- {(
room was particularly attractive: ]
with its numbers o? red candles, j
Christmas garlands and bells, and '
holly. The table was laid with a
handsome lace cioth over red, with .
a centerpiece of cut flowers and
ferns. |f
Receiving at the door were Mes- ?

Miss Epps then gave a most interesting

handsome oil-paintings from nature. 1
At the conclusion of the address,

We understand that those we had
vere too expensive for these hard

We have a man who is such a beiever
in fresh air that he sleeps with
til windows and doors open, though
t gale be blowing. Tuesday mornng
he came out with a frost-bitten
>ar. It is supposed that he got
mough air on that ear to suit him
;or the present.
A salt famine seems to be threat
ning this community. The merihants
cannot get anything like
?nough to supply the demand, and
;he situation is really becoming se ious,
especially when it is consider?d
that now is the time for the fartiers
to cure their pork. What will
result, if they cannot get salt for
:his purpose? Also, there is no grist
;o be had. This, however, is a small
natter, so long as we have grist
nills. But the lack of salt, that's
mother matter.
,The graded and high schools closed
'ast. Fridav until after the holidays.
[t wa9 not originally the intention to

SRITA1N REJECTS PEACE OFFER.
Rotable Speech of British Prettier
on Germany's Proposition.
London, December 19:?The antouncement
in the House of Comnons
today by David Lloyd George,
he new prime, minister, that the
irst act of his administration was
he rejection of the proposal of the
Central Powers for a peace confer>nce
constituted one of the most
nomentous scenes which the oldest
Jarliementary veterans had ever
vitnessed.
The new premier declared that beore
the allies could give favorable
;onsideration to such invitation they
nust know that Germany wa3 pre>ared
to accede to the allies' terms,
'giving complete restitution, full
eparation and effectual guarantees"
md to enter a conference upon the
nvitation of Germany, proclaiming
lerself victorious, without any
cnowledge of her proposals would

i He announced that the note present-1 |
led through Washington contained '
j no proposals of terms, but was- a
j paraphrase of Chancellor von Beth- jj
' rnann-Hollweg's speech and that the ^
j allies had separately concluded to ?<

almost at the same moment Earl ; t

, the government would enter no con-, ^
I ference that did not guarantee for 1 ?
j Europe the free and independent I j
j existence of nations great and small. ' ?
i The Marquis of Crewe affirmed the q
approval of the members of the late y
government. 0
The day was a doubly important' n
one for the Commons because the i
new premier unfolded his pro-! a
gramme for wide reaching war i j,
measures and Mr Asquith closed the ' (
j last chapter of his nine years of j ^
I leadership with an accounting of his g
! war stewardship. C
The principal feature of Mr Lloyd
George's programme is a measure ^
for national service, matching Ger-;

citizen will be liable for enrollment
