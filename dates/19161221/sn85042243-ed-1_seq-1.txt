That person is N. A. Mason of Wim­

ance business. Mr. Masons appoint­
ment was firBt announced by the gov­
ernor last night in Fargo, whither his
private secretary accompanied him.
Messrs. Frazier and Mason reached

lated No. 1, and most of the day was

nor vetted various departments,

Mr. 1^0n hjmi'from Iowa original­
ly. He his been a resident of North
Dakota for more than 12 years, practi­
cally all of which'time has been spent
at Wimbledon. He retired from the
undertaking and Insurance business
some time ago, and he disposed of his
insurance business in order to accept
his present appointment.
Here Next Week.
Governor Frazier announced this
morning that he will install his fam­
ily in the executive mansion the lat­
ter part of next week. The family
will be one of the largest which has
occupied the governor's dwelling for
a number of years, the children con­
sisting of twin daughters, Unie and
Versie, christened in honor of the
state university from which their
father graduated shortly before their
birth Vernon, aged ten, and Willis,
aged sev^n. All of the young Fraziers
will enroll In the Bismarck public
schools with the opening of the next
semester.
Mr. and Mrs. Frazier are devout
Methodists and will immediately, af­
ter their arrival here, become mem­
bers of the McCabe Memorial Metho­
dist Episcopal church.
Other Appointments.
Governor-elect Frazier stated this
morning that he is not yet prepared to
announce his appointments as regards
his executive clerk and stenographer.
As to other state appointments, he
has nothing to say at the present. Nor
would he indicate anything that may
be contained in the inaugural address
which he has prepared for delivery
January 3. The inaugural ceremonies
are expected to take place, as usual,
in the house chamber, where Chief
Justice Andrew A. Bruce of the North
Dakota supreme court will administer
the oaths to Governor Frazier and
other elective officers.
Favors Compensation.
In the course of a conversation in
the secretary of state's office this
morning, the governor-elect let drop
the fact that he favors workmen's
compensation and that he anticipates
some legislation on this subject at the
next session. He intimated that he
would favor a state plan of indemnify­
ing employers and protecting employ­
es. He also spoke favorably of a gen­
eral minimum wage law and of a spe­
cial minimum wage law for women,
both of which measures, with the com­
pensation act, have the endorsement
of the North Dakota federation of lab
or.
The governor-elect and his private
secretary will return this evening to
Fargo.

MY PROVE FATAL
(Special to the Tribune.)
Jamestown, N. D., Dec. 21.—As the
result of an explosion, when he toss­
ed gasoline into a stove to "coax" the
fire, H. V. Cobb, a laborer, was
brought to Parkview hospital yester­
day afternoon from Robinson, suffer­
ing from injuries which might prove
fatal.
With a companion, whose name has
not been learned, Cobb was engaged
in carpenter work, finishing a school
building at Robinson, and was bach­
ing in a small shack. When the blaze
in the stove did not kindle fast
enough to suit Cobb he threw in a
quantity of gasoline.
The resultant explosion completely
destroyed the shack, scattering fire
over the interior of the building.
Cobb was badly burned about the
face. His companion received pain­
ful, but not serious burns.

the strength of recent peace talk

UNITED STATES INTERESTS
ARE NOW AT STAKE
TO SEND ANSWERS.
(United Press)
London, Dec. 21.—England will
send her reply to the German
peace proposals- within 24 hours,
it became known here this after­
noon. Various allied capitals will
send their answers at the same
time by way of neutral powers,
through whom the original Ger
man suggestions were sent.
(By Associated Press.)
Washington, Dec. 21.—In formal
notes to all the belligerents, Presi­
dent Wilson, without proposing peace
or offering mediation, has appealed
to them to discuss terms which may
end the war.
The president's notes had been
practically 48 hours on their way to­
day and officials believed they had
reached all the foreign capitals. All
official Washington is listening with
the keenest expectation to any indi­
cation of how the notes will be re­
ceived.
Diplomatists think that it is incred­
ible that President Wilson should
have hastened his action without
some belief that it would not be flatly
rejected without consideration by the
Entente Allies. The wish and a hope
of the German Allies that he take
some such step long has been well
known and there is no doubt of the
manner of its reception among them.
United States' Course.
Officials and diplomats here, an­
alyzing the president's note, find
something deeper than an appeal for
consideration of peace terms. They
see that the president, in acting, was
also considering what would have to
be the course of the United States to
conserve its interests as a neutral if
the war is to continue.
Coupled with the president's recent
declaration that the position of neu­
trals was becoming intolerable, they
attach much significance to his state­
ments in the notes that his sugges­
tions come from a neutral whose in­
terests have been seriously affected
by the war, and "whose concern for
its conclusion arises out of a manifest
necessity to determine how best to
safeguard those interests if the war
is to continue."
Bernstorff Satisfied.
In German quarters, a conviction
that the president's action would sure­
ly lead to some sort of a considera­
tion of peace terms was expressed in
the following authorized statement by
Count von Bernstorff, the German am­
bassador:
"Now I am perfectly convinced that
there will be a conference."

DANGER TO US.
Washington, Dec. 21.—Plainly
hinting that there is a danger of
the United States being drawn
into the European war, Secretary
Lansing said today that the real
object of President Wilson's note
at this time is to avoid such a
condition. He said that condU
tions are rapidly becoming intol
erable and that for that reason,
Wilson demanded a show down
at this time.
The most influential peace so­
ciety would be two million men
under arms, officers of the Na­
tional Defense league asserted to
day, in a propaganda arguing for
universal military training. They
said that the average man thinks
that the other fellow will go, and
is relying upon what they claim
to be a false statement that Am*
erica could raise one million, men
from sunup to sundown, if need*
ed.
Secretary Lansing today aifc
thorized the following statement:
"The reasons for sending the
npte were jm'follows:
"It isn't trur material interest
"wb had in mind when tTli liott"
was sent, but more and more our
own rights are becoming involved
by the belligerents on both sides,
so that the situation is becoming
increasingly critical.
"I mean by that we are draw
ing nearer the verge of war our­
selves, and therefore are entitled
to know exactly what each bellig­
erent seeks in order that we may
regulate our conduct in future."
(United Press)
Washington, Dec. 121.—In mak­
ing his first formal effort at get­
ting peace terms from belligerent
powers, President Wilson acted
with the knowledge that other
world neutrals would stay behind
him. This much became known
here today.
Greatest confidence that the
President's peace efforts wonld
succeed pervaded the Capital to­
day. The President's action
came as from the clear sky, of*
ficials said, but none wonld com­
ment other than to say that they
were surprised.
Mixed Feeling.
In diplomatic circles the note was
greeted with mixed feeling. Comment
at the German embassy was made on
the studied languarge of the note.
There it was said that the note seem­
ed to follow the outline of David
Lloyd George's address to the house
of commons.
British Satisfied.
On the other hand, the British em­
bassy expressed more satisfaction
with the Wilson note. It was pointed
note took cognizance of the fact that
note too kcognizance of the fact that
England is not so much interested in
territorial adjustment as is Prance
and Belgium, whose territory has
been taken by the Teutons.
Asks For Terms.
President Wilson, in his appeal to
ail warring nations asked them speci­
fically for the terms upon which they
would enter peace. His action was
utterly independent of any recent
peace moves, but was believed to have
been with the knowledge of all other
neutrals. The president's note was ad­
dressed to European belligerents,
through United States ambassadors,
and was duplicated to all. The plans
were kept secret until the note had
been dispatched and in the hands of
the various ambassadors. Some of
the salient paragraphs of the presi­
dent's note are:
Features of Note.
"If the contest must continae to
proceed toward undefined ends by
slow attrition until the one group of
belligerents or the other is exhausted,
if millions after millions of human
lives must continue to be offered up
until on the one side or the other
there are no more to offer, if resent­
ments must be kindled that can never
cool and despairs be engendered from
which there can be no recovery, hopes
of peace and the willing concert of
free peoples will be rendered vain
and idle. TIM
