NATURE IK WOODS AND FIELD

jie . '"X so blinded by selfieh-
round pieces of hard metal 4s they roll
aJon before his greedy eyes.. His head
is rarely ever lifted above or-beyond his
narrow vision and he fails to see the
beautiful panorama of nature unfolded
it all its beauty around him. .".Man who
in his primitive state was a very part
of this nature so lavishly bestowed has
almost completely severed the ties and
lives within his own personal house of
rreen and selfishness.
Nature, smiling and beckoning in every,
bud and flower in springtime ; blessing
the dew drop and the rose, nourishing
the wheat and the corn in the summer
and garlanding the harvest and the gold'-.
on rod in the autumn and pain-ting the
the litlds and woods with the colors of
the heavenly city in fall, one would think
there was nothing le.ft to interest in the
chilly blasts of winter. But not so, is
there anything prettier than the white
carpeted earth with its beautiful snow;
the lisiht, downy flakes as they fall gen
tly to mother earth from the heavens
above; nature's best and purest offering
for the protection of the "staff of life,"
and her symbol of purity and innocence.
The icicles, as they bang from tree and
house, glistening in the crisp air, rough,
uneven shapes of various lengths, but
fashioned in a way that no human hand
can imitate, looking like so many irre
descent lights.
Then take a stroll or a ride upon a
fair winter day, and what do you see.
You gaze upon- the fields and you see
everything apparently dead from the
wintry blasts, the stubble and the vines.
Look at the woods, the oak and the hick
ory stand shorn of ' their leaves, which
lie lightly on the ground, everything ap
parently lifeless, but in the trees the sap
of life still exists, and in the fields the
grass has been nipped, but the roots are
alive, ready to shoot the life currents
at the first call of spring Bv-t have you
noticed the pine and the cedar, yet re
taining their pretty coats of green lift
ing their smiling heads among the count
less thousands of brother trees t iat were
gay and pretty in the springtime. But
here stand these sentinels of spring, sum
mer, fall and winter with the same coat
of green neither heat nor cold affecting
them. If you will put your imagination
to working you can see a great city as
it were, inhabited by thousands. of rest
less, moving people, some in Irouble, oth
ers happy; the plaintive sighing of 4 the
oppressed; the joyful greetings of the
blessed. Their language is understood j
they perform their several duties and

ANENT OLD VIOLINS.
The editor also has an old violin bear
ing the same date as the one referred to
in The Enterprise of last Thursday and
the same "artist's" name appears on it
Antonius Stradinarius Cemenensis, at
one time Italy's greatest master of the
violin- and the same date, 1763. There
are several others in this section with the
same inscription. We purchased ours
from an old gentleman who deals in cu
rios, old money, Indian utensils, musi
cal instruments and his name, too, was
Barney. It seems that it was easy to
have tickets printed with the above in
scription and jasted to old violins. The
type ued is rather too modern for 1763,
too. We thought a fortune was awaiting
us and had it sent to New York under
registered express and instead it was
found that the old violin was worth
$1.98, and that the great Italian master
workman had nothing to do with its con
struction, having died one hundred or
more years before our violin was made.
Yes, we will sell our "Antonious" for
a small su-m. The music from its strings
are sweet, like unto the voice of the
nightingale or the bob-o-link, but ii
never came from sunny Italy.
But we ""have an old. musical instru
ment sure enough a delsimo, made in
Norway in the 17th century out of a
rare wood, a cross-cut saw being Used in
its construction. It was in the family
of a North Carolina product for three
generations. There are only three stririgs
to the old relic and you make musit by
bringing a reed into contact with the
strings.
A NEW DEPARTURE.
The paid members of the fire depart
ment of the city will make an hourly
inspection of the main business section,
running from English street on North
Main to Green street on South Main.
This new departure will give to High
Point a lower insurance rate. The idea
is a good one. -

LOFLIN'S
BASKETBALL GAME AT WINSTON.
(Reported for The Review.)
High Point made its initial debut into
the basketball circles in Winston -Salem
last week in a spirited contest between
the Y. M. C. A. representative team and
the Hjgh Point Athletic club.
It was evident after the first five min
utes of plajr that the Twin City quin
tet had the visiting team outclassed in
passing, if not in shooting, and the game
was much better than the score would
indicate.
The best advantage was the possession
of the ball on the .tip-off, Winston-Salem
securing the ball practically all of ihe
time, to the .detriment of the High
Pointers. This enabled the. winners to
retain possession of the ball much more
than their opponents and resulted in
many field goals, although the failure of
the Twin City team in locating the
basket lowered the score considerably.
For High Point, Rochelle played ex
cellent ball, as well as Hardee. These
two were clearly the best material on
the team, Hardee guarding Rector, one
of Winston-Saems- best forwards, and
considering the disadvantage ff playing
on a strange floor, did well in holding
his opponent to four goals. Morris, who
was substituted ;for. Rector in the sec
ond half, secured two goals on him iiv
15 minutes.
For Winston-Salem, Bazemore was the
shining light. On guard he netted six
goals while holding his opponent score
less and played fast ball the entire game.
The Twjn City team will probably play
here in a few weeks and a large attend
ance should greet them: -
