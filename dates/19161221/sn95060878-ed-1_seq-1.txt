MORE OSTRICHES
COMING TO YUMA
Two years ago there were more oc-
triches in the Salt River Valley than
anywhere else on earth ouside of Ar-
rica. They were considered as live
stock and about 8000 were listed on
the tax rolls. Today it is doubtful it
the valley contains much more than
1000 of the giant birds and the num
ber is growing less as fast as disposi
tion can be made of them. Ostrich
breeding has ceased and hundreds of
the birds have been sent to Yuma ana
disposed of at bargain prices as low
as $5 a head, to any buyer. A few hun
dred have been scattered around on
the ranchers of the Yuma Valley and
are cared for with the cattle.
Announcement has :just been made
that 100 octricb.es on the unanuier
ranches near Chandler, are to be kill
ed and fed to the hogs. The rest of
the band of 275 will be shipped to the
Yuma Valley. A band of 250 choice
birds will be retained in the hope that
the feather market may show some life
in the future.
One hundred and seventy-
three El Paso citizens were
sufficiently interested to get
out and vote yesterday on the
proposition to issue $225,000
bonds for city purposes, and
32 of them were against the
bonds. El Paso just natural
ly refuses to take any inter
est in sums less than a mil
lion. El Paso Times.

LONDON, Dec. 22. The
Hague dispatches today said
that it was semi-officially an
nounced that Germany
would state peace terms im
mediately if the allied replies
left the door open for nego
tiations.
(By Associated Press.)
LONDON, Dec. 22. Bo
nar Law told the house of
commons today that the Brit
ish should withhold comment
of President Wilson's note.
The British will deal with it
after a consultation with the
other allies.
(By Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22.
Diplomats here are eagerly
watching to see whether the
European neutrals will fol
low the American lead and
possibly send out a joint ap
peal. Spanish and Swiss re
presentatives have been to
the state department repeat
edly, and are probably fully
acquainted with the Ameri
can plans.
Surprise was general at the
president's increasingly sig
nificant move. Knowledge,
that the president counted on
an absolutely frank reply
which will lead to actual op
portunity for negotiations is
only less surprising than the
note itself.
Gratification over the indi
cations that the allied diplo
mats would advise their gov
ernments' reply in a friendly
spirit. Early London press
comment is that the note is
painful because it states to
the belligerents practically
the same as the other note
and was unexpected here,
where attention is directed to
that feature.
CANTU HOLDING
ALL HIS MEN
Calexico Chronicle: Emphatic de
nial is made by Governor Cantu of
the rumor in circulation a day of two
since, to the effect that he is rischarg
ing his soldiers in the interests of econ
omy. "My soldiers are a happy, contented
and very loyal force," the governor
is quoted as saying yesterday; "why
should they not be? They are soldiers
by profession, and they are the highest
paid soldiers in the world, each man
receiving $1.50 a day in cash not
promises."
Under the present conditions, Gov
ernor Cantu said he saw no necessity
for increasing his army, but he does
not contemplate reducing it for any
reason.
The state of New Mexico
spent $2,000,000 for educa
tion during the past year, and
the state superintendent of
public instruction recom
mends to the legislature that
next year's appropriation be
made $10,000,000r and that
free text books be provided
for all pupils. At the present
rate of progress, the New
Mexico school system, al
ready excellent, will soon be
among the best in the United
States.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 22.
Official copies of Secre
tary Lansing's two state
ments explaining the presi
dent's note were sent to the
American diplomats abroad
to show the foreign govern
ments and thus avoid miss-
construction or the presi
dent s purpose.
(By Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 22.
-Congressional investigation
of the state department's
conflicting interpretations of
the president's note to deter
mine if anyone high in the
administration or his rela
tives profited from the result
ant stock market fluctuations
was asked in Representative
Wood's resolution.
(By Associated Press.)
LONDON, Dec. 22. Par
liament prologued without
further announcement of the
British atitude on President
Wilson's note or the German
peace proposal. The king's
speech was read in both
houses and was the briefesc
Ion record. It expresed scon-
fidence of ultimate victory
and a determination that the
allies to prosecute the war
"until vindicated the rights
so ruthlessly violated by our
enemies and established the
security of Europe on a sure
foundation."
(By Associated Press.)
LONDON, Dec. 22. The
general public like the press
was taken aback by the note
having reached the conclu
sion that Lloyd George's
speech ended all peace talk
unless the Teutons defined
their terms.
NATIONAL PROHIBI
TION COMING.
Nation wide prohibition is
looming up in congress, as
will be seen from a bill intro
duced .in that body by the ju
diciary committee which rec
ommended it by a twelve to
seven vote in the house and
thirteen to three in the sen
ate. The bill reads:
Section 1. That the sale,
manufacture for sale, trans
portation for sale and impor
tation for sale of intoxicating
liquors for beverage purpose
in the United States and all
territories subject to the jur
isdiction thereof, and expor
tation thereof, are forever
prohibited.
Section 2. That the con
gress and the states shall have
power independently or con
currently to enforce this ar
ticle by all needful legisla
tion. A New Jesry preacher has
been suing his wife for di
vorce because she demanded
ten dollars each for her kisses.

TOM CAMPBELL
THIS III
That attorneys for Gover
nor Hunt and Governor-
elect Campbell will reach an
agreement on a stipulation
to hurry the contest, was
learned last night, says the
Republican. While no an
nouncement was permitted
to be made by either Senator
Ives or Judge Sloan, it was
learned on reliable authority
that all opposition to the is
sue of the certificate of elec
tion by Sidney Osborn would
vanish this morning.
Governor-elect Campbell
can qualify today, then take
the oath of office and be pre
pared, in case the contest is
not decided against him be
fore January 1, to sit as chief
executive of the state of Ari
zona.
Under the terms said to
have been agreed to in gen
eral last night, but not to be
signed until today, the con
testant will withdraw Bis ob
jection to the issuance by
the secretary of state of a
certificate of election, and
will dismiss his appeal in the
action brought by himself
against Sidney P. Osborn, as
secretary of state and will dis
miss such action.

MRS. MOORE, S. S. Supt.
Representative Stevens has
introduced a bill in congress
for the ouroose of securing
reimbursement to the state of
money expended in protect
ing the border and fighting
Indians by Texas rangers way
back in 1866-76. Congress
man Stevens was a scout in
those days and is well equip
ped to inform his colleagues
of the character of the serv
ices rendered by the Texans
against hostile Indians and
lawless Mexicans.
ludeins from utterances
of Premier Briand and Lloyd
Georee. the rumor that the
entente allies were ready for
oeace on Germany's terms
was just a trifle exaggerated.
Every little while someone
dishes up an article on "The
Passing of the Rube." And
the rube has been out of date
for so many years no one
even remembers what he
looked like.
The ways of some women
are past understanding, and
some have no ways at all.

YUMA LIGHT MANAGER
LEAVES FOR THE COAST
Is Optimistic Regarding Yuma and
Promises Yuma Up To Date Water,
Light and Power Service In Due
Time.
R. M. Moore, president and general
manager of the Yuma Light, Gas &
Water Company, who is here check
ing up the company business, will
leave tonight for his headquarters at
Los Angeles, where he is also identi
fied with the Continental Securities
Company, Angels Flight Railway Com
pany, Lompoc Light &Power Com
pany, Peeople's Water Company of
Palms, Realty Board Building, with
offices in the Union Oil Building. Mr.
Moore is most optimistic regarding the
prospects for a first class power and
light service here and when told this
evening that the Examiner plant had
been without power four hours of an
eight hour shift today he said his
company certainly regretted such a
condition and would make every pos
sible effort to give Yuma a service sec
ond to none, just as quickly as time
and available capital would permit.
The new company has now been in
charge about thirty days and has-plans
laid Tor many changes, including a
possible connection with the Sierra
Power Company of Southern Califor
nia, and when this connection is made
electric energy will be available for
Yuma's present and future needs. Mr.
Moore does not promise impossible
things but assures the Examiner that
his company is not indifferent to Yu
ma's welfare and urgent needs.
BILL TO PROHIBIT
ALL POLITICAL ADS.
Senator Owen of Oklahoma, who is
in charge of the bill known as the cor
rupt practices act, having for Its pur
pose the control and limiting of ex
penditures in political campaigns,
makes the rather startling proposition
that a limit should be placed upon po
litical advertising or that it should be
prevented altogether.
Senator Owen advanced this idea
when the suggestion was made to him
that newspapers ought to be compelled
to accept advertising from any political
party or candidate if it was not inde
cent or libelous.
He remarks that he thought politi
cal advertising ought to be suppressed
and instanced the large amount of ex
penditures for different parties in the
recent campaign. He spoke of page
advertisements at $1000 a page and
said that the editors and employes of
the papers were bound to be influ
enced by the business office of the
newspaper receiving such large adver
tising patronage.
