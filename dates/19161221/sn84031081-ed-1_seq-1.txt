Omaha, Neb., Dec -'0. Twelve
hundred wild horses, supposed to
range the government reservation in
Coconino county, Arizona, were sold
by John Sinclair, of Flagstaff, to J
Sidney Smith, of Omaha, for S3 1-3
cents a bead, Smith told a jury in
federal court here today. Witnesses
for the government previously testi
fied they paid $r.ll to 1 7 r, a head for
these horses, believing they were, as
ix presented, "bred up from imported
I'ercherons," or that "Morgan or
Hamblelonlan stallions hail been
turned loose In the wild Herds sev
eral years ago."
Smith was a witness In his own be
half In the government s suit against
lb.. I'nited Slates Livestock . ompany
and the Omaha I-und and Investment
company, charged with use of the
mails to defraud in sales of more wild
horses than existed in Coconino
county, by which, the government al
leges, a large number of persons were
swindled of sums totaling $ 1,000,000.
Smith is president of the Cnited
States livestock company, and is one
of the forty-four men indicted, eleven
of whom are now on trial.
Smith testified he bought IvS.'"'"
wild .horses, 4,000 of which he still
owned. He was of the opinion there
were 20,0011 wild horses on the reser
vation, although witnesses lor the
government testified it was known
there were at no time more than 4,
fdO, a majority of them mavericks
belonging t the state an,) to settlers.
None of the purchasers, the witness
said, insisted on the company catching
the horses. They could be corraled,
he told the jury, but it would be a
"man sized job."

Washington, Dec. -20. Independent
members of the, incoming house of
representatives are planning an' or
ennl' nion to work nnart from both
democrats and republicans with the
avowed purpose of enforcing radical
I changes in the rules.
Thus far no plans have been made
I for voting as a body in the speaker

I such an arrangement will be attempt
ed later. Informal conferences among
independents now in congress have re

Conferences have proceeded quietly,
usually on the floor of the house.
Participants are disinclined to talk,

however, the nature of the immediate
plans.
"We are anxious that the rules be
amended so that the people may
l.iiow what their representatives are
doing," he said. '"ITc" plvsTTh' x.V.tct;t
of voting in the committee of the
whole makes it possible for members
to frequently conceal their votes on
very important proposals. I think if
we can remedy this situation and
makii some changes in the method of
reporting bills from committees, an
independent organization will be
worth while."
Four InilclM-nileiits.
Four Independents, Representatives
Schall of Minnesota, ami Martin of
Louisiana, progressives; Randall of
California, prohibitionist, and London
of New York, socialist, are in the pres
ent house. They hope that Representative-elect
Fuller of Massachu
setts, and Kelly of Pennsylvania, and
Rankin of .Montana, will Join lheni.
Messrs. Fuller and Kelly were elected
as Independents. Miss Rankin is a
republican, but hope of her independ
ence Is based on the fact that she was
opposed by the republican organiza
tion In the primary.
The personnel of the coming house
is in doubt. Roth Speaker Clark and
Republican Leader Mann declared tq
day that their respective sides would
have at least 21 X votes, a majority, on
the speakership.
"We will 'control the house, unless
tho democrats buy it. and they are
trying to do that now," Representative
Mann said. Indicating his belief that
promises of organization favors were
being hold out to independents by the
present majority.
.speaker Clark said the democrats
already wire assured of 2 Ifi democrat
ic members, and that he is certain two
more will be seated in pending con
tests. THREE HELD FOR DEATH

When General Scott, before the
