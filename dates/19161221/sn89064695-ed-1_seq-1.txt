One Indian Agent For
Minnesota Chippewas.
If the suggestions of some mem
bers of this reservation are heeded
by tiie de'egafion from this reser
vatioh that is now at Washington
a bill will be introduced in eon
gress to create an Indian agency
which will take charge of all the
Chippewa Indians in this state.
There would be much advantage
not only to the Indians, who pay
the salaries of the numerous super
intendents who are now employ
ed in the Chippewa service, but to
the government.
Formerly one Indian agent had
charge of the White Earth, Red
Lake, Leech Lake, Winnebegosish,
Cass Lake 'ind White Oak Point
bands, but now these bands are
compelled to pay the salaries of
less than four superintendents
and an army of clerks and other
employees.
Formerly the Fond du ic,
Grand Portage and Boisforte bands
of Chippewas were under trie
charge of the LaPointe InJian
agent, but now they have three
superintendents who draw as large
salaries each as the former agent
did, and these salaries are all paid
from Ch'ppewa tribal funds.
If the present administration has
in view the interests of the Chip
pewas. the superintendencies in
this state among the Chippewas
should^ be abolished, and one In
dian agency established, and the
Chippewa dt'legatas IMSW at*Wa$lv
in^ton should try and accomplish
this.
DELE
GATES AT WASHING-
The Chippewa delegates who
are now at Washington have not
as yet taken any active steps to
urge certain legislation which the
recent council here instructed them
to urge.
Tne delegates had hoped they
would reach Washington in time
hive certain legislation put into
the Indian appropriation bill now
pending before the senate, but the
house of representatives lost no
t'.mo in passing the bill, so that
now all new legislation will be
subj- ct to a point of order, and for
thi- reison the delegates have not
much hopes to be able to accom
phsh mnch.
leers May Search for
Liquor at any Time.
Judge Page Morris in the United
States district court, has he!d that
the Indian agents, sub agents and
commanding officers of military
posts may search the premises of
those sn-mected of bringing liquor
into Indian territory without the
formality of the formal search
warrent, says the Duluth Herald.
Judge Morris denied a motion
for an order for the United States
district attorney to return certain
papers to Arthur Boppel of Brain
erd, which were taken from him
by Indian Agent Ivan G. Boyd
lat March.
Boppel, through his attorney,
M. E. Ryan, asserted that the
agent had no right to search with
out a warrant and asked for an
order requiring the United States
district attorney to return the
papers.

age of lands along the Red Lake
river by the officials of the Red
Like Indian reservation has been
assured land owners, according to
information received by Senator
D. P. O'Neill of this city. This
drainage will be of inestimable
value to a large number of people
in the eastern part of Pennington
county and those living on the
westerly border of the reserva
tion.
The two-mile strip through
Steiner, Star and Highkory town
ships, lying next to the reserva
tion, have been inundated practi
cally all the time this la&t season,
and the residents have been after
the county officials for some time
to put in a ditch along the divid
ing line between the dounty and
the reservation. The county hoard
recently agreed to do this if the
reservation authorities would stand
for half of the st but this is im
possible as there can be no assess
ment of Indian lands.
However, when the matter was
brought to the aitention of Indian
Agent Dickens he took the matter
up with the federal authorities
and secured their approval of a
ditch one mile within the reserva
tii running north and south.
This will no doubt be undertaken
in the spring.
The cost of fhe ditch wili fall
entirely on the Indians, as it will
be entirely within their reserva
tion, but the lands in Pennington
county will receive just as much
benefit Minneapolis Tribune.
Life Worth fern
ion.
Minnesota's annual wealth in
wild life assets, including game
birds and aninriK fish and com
merce and agricultural benefits
relative thereto, is $10,300,000
says the game and fish department,
in a report made public last week.
Commercial iishing has become an
important industry in the state,
the department says, and in its
biennial reoort it points out that
tourist tr?vel inspired by fishing
and hunting opportunities is in its
infancy and capable or great de
velopment.
Minnesott trappers and hunters
take about 3,000,000 muskrat, 75,-
000 skunks and 20,000 wolves an
nually, representing a value of $1,-
310,000, and various numbers of at
least 12 other fur-bearing animals.
Although about 8,000 deer were
killed by hunters in 1915, the de
partment see no danger of the ex
termination of deer. Moose are
more dependent for their preser
vation upon the Superior refuge,
the muntenance of which will
make the moose a permanent feat
ure of Minnesota wild life.
The game bird situation is less
satisfactory, the department says,
the dtpletion of grouse being
alarming. The scarcity of pat
ridges is noted and prairie chick
ens are becoming rarer. The mi
gratory bid law has protected the
migratory water fowl although
drainage has bad an adverse effect.
I Minnesota now has 1,000,000
acres set aside for wild life sane

Crow Indians Make $350,000
Raising Cattle.
The Crow Indians of Montana
went into the cattle raising busi
ness two years ago under the sup
ervision of the department of the
interior. The other day Cato
Sells, commissioner of Indian
affairs, announced that the venture
had netted the Indians $350,000.
Mr. S'lls personally aided in the
recent sale of 34 car*- of Crow cat
tle at the Chicago stockyards. The
day before the Chicago sale 17
other carloads of cattle had been
sold at Omaha,
It was in June 1914, that the In
dian commissioner persuaded the
Indians to make their cattle in
vestment. The funds for the ac
cumulation of a herd were obtained
by the sale of Crow lands, and for
the Indians the government agents
bought 7,000 young heifers, 2,000
yearling steers and 250 bulls. The
care of the herd was personally
supervised by government agents
in Montana.
The year the herd was purchased
the Indians took extraordinary
precautions to protect their bovine
charges from the rigors of a Mon
tana winter. The summer before
they cut and stacked no less than
7,000 tons of hay, and while star
vation and cold were cutting into
the profits of white stock raisers
at an alarming rate, the Indians
had the satisfaction of seeing only
2 per cent of their herds succumb
ing to the ravages of cold.
Tu^tbe go$ old days it was the
poliey of the Indian tribes on res
ervations to lease their grazing

lands to white cattle owners at
some ridiculously low figure with
the usual result that the white
man made most of the money.
Within the last three years, how
ever, the Indian office has been
encouraging Indian stock breed
ing.
Three years ago one Indian res
e.rvation in the northwest had 2,
800 acres under cultivation. As a
result of the interior department's
policy in urging the Indians to do
their own farming and stock rais
ing, this same reservation had
15,000 acres under cultivation last
year.
Back of the idea of encouraging
farming and stock raising, how
ever, is the basic idea of the de
partment of the interior to change
the western Indian from a plains
man into an extensive farmer.
Tnis change, of course, cannot be
made in a generation, and no such
rapid transformation is expected,
but the Indians have mot the in
tentions of the government more
than half way, it i3 declared
Many Indians on reservations are
now the most wealthy and pros
perous farmers in their section,
while as stockmen they are even
more successful.
The Indian of the plains, the In
dian office declares, is a natural
herdsman. He is a lover of horses,
and readily adapts himself to the
raising of cattle and sheep. Dur
ing the last three years the Indian
office has purchased, with fuuds
gathered by the Indians, more
than $2,000,000 worth of cattle,
horses and sheep, both for tribal
and individual herds.
In cases, however, where the
department agents have been un-
