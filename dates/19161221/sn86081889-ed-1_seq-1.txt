In addition to the notice given
in the News last week, the Bed
ford Gazette gives the following
additional information in refer
ence to the death of Mrs. George
Carbaugh (Nora Ritchey) in
Bedford last week. "Tripping
over a rug in the sitting room of
her home on Thomas street, Mon
day morning, Mrs. George Car
baugh fell, striking the back of
her head against a table, inflict
ing a wound which caused her
death a few moments later.
Mrs. Carbaugh had not been well
for several weeks and it is
thought by her physician that
she was seized with an attack of
heart trouble, causing the fall.
She was aged about 25 years and
was Miss Nora Ritchey, of near
Everett, before her marriage a
few years ago to George Car
baugh, a well known young
liveryman of this place. Besides
her husband and a small son
Harold, she is survived by her
mother.
Farmers' Institutes.
With Chairman Frank Ranck
and his able corps of State Work
ers, the Annual County Institutes
are in full swing this week. The
work began at Enid Monday aft
ernoon with an attendance of
about forty farmers and the at
tendance and interest increased
with each session until two hun
dred and twenty interested per
sons were present at the closing
session, Tuesday night The
State workers are all specialists
in their respective lines, and the
work of the entire time is a . real
feast of good things for the farm
er and home maker.
The institute in McConnells
burg opened yesterday afternoon
and a session was held last even
ing. The farmers in this sec
tion do not need any coaxing.
They have long ago, found out
that a Farmers' Institute is a
good place to get "sonething for
nothing" and they are on hands
from start to finish.
The Lincoln-Penn Way.
The above title is suggested by
one of our local motorists to be
applied to a cross-country boule
vard to connect the Lincoln High
way at McConnellsburg with the
William Penn Highway at Mount
Union. This is the only practica
ble cross-country route between
Harrisburg and Johnstown. It
would pass through Shirleysburg,
Orbisonia, Shade Gap, Burnt Cab
ins, Fort Littleton, and Knobs
ville. The grade is exceptional
ly fine and the distance only
forty miles. It would at once
become a thorofare for tourists
from the northern and western
part of the State to reach Get
tysburg, Baltimore, Washington
and all southern points.
Let everyone interested get
busy with the Highway Depart-
ment and arouse interest
along the whole lino.
Dr. Skinner Dead.
Very many Fulton County peo
ple will learn with real sorrow of
the death of Dr. William F. Skin

lar heart trouble. For several
years he had been on the medical
staff of the Chamborsburg hos
pital, and was a surgeon of rare
skill. He was a son of John and
Emmeline Skinner, and was born
at Dry Run, Franklin County on
the 23rd of December, 1867. He
was married to Lotta Blanche
Skinner, a sister of the late Cap
tain Geo. W. Shinner, who sur
vives together with two daugh
ters. The longest continuous flight
of any bird is made by the gold

A Family Reunion.
A most happy event occurred
on last Friday in the home of
Mrs. Margaret Kendall and her
daughter Miss Ruth in the South
Extension of McConnellsburg.
All her seven', together with all
the grandchildren, save five in
Tarkio, Mo., gathered in the

and fifteen grandchildren. As
they sat around the well furnish
ed table of their mother and look
ing into each other's fages.and
recalled the happenings of the
past 21 years since they similar
ly met, pleasures were theirs
rarely enjoyed. To enhance the
pleasures and profit of the
occasion the family pastor having
been called in, they once more
gathered around the old family
altar to render due praise and
gratitude to the gracious Bene
factor of their lives and to invoke
His continued care through all
the rest of the years.

OUR DISTANT FRIENDS.
Interesting Extracts from Letters Re
cently Received from Former Ful

Rev. C. W. Summey, Apollo,
Pa. "Enclosed find check for
$2.00 which you will please credit
to my subscription on the News.
Since I last wrote you my health'
has very much improved. So
much that I was looking forward
to making a trip to Fulton County
on the new rail road. But in that
it seems I will be disappointed.
But life is full of disappoint
ments." Mrs. C. A. McConnell, La
Harpe, III,, Dec. 7, 1916:-En-closed,

come the News as we would an
old friend. One short year ago
this evening, we arrived home
from a two months' visit among
brothers and sisters and many
other relatives and friends in
Pennsylvania. We are having
lovely fall weather.
Mrs. Adam Gress, York, Pa.
We are all tolerably well. Un
cle George keeps right well. We
were sorry to hear of the rail
road's going up. We had made
up our minds to go across the
mountain on the first train. Re
gards to all.
William Buterbaugh, Mar
shallton, Del. Here's three dol
lars to push our subscription
ahead. We certainly enjoy read
ing about our good old Fulton
County friends. Wish you all a
merry Christmas and a happy
New Year.
Dr. W. T. Grove, Eureka,
Kans. We had bad crop failures
again, and, "croply" speaking,
we are worse off than in 1913,
when one of the greatest
droughts within the recollection
of the old settlers visited us.
Then, we had a surplus, but three
years have depleted that ma
terially; but, we hope soon to be
an Oil County. Some 20 or 30
rigs are up or under process of
construction. Four wells in this
county are estimated at 200 to
300 barrels. Our belt seems to
run in a n. e. and s. w. direction,
and it is about 18 to 20 miles
in width. So, if we happen to
strike oil good, the corn will take
care of itself.
Mrs. C. R. Stunkard, He
lena, Mont., The News is one
of the most inportant papers that
comes into our house. We are
having fine winter weather. If
"A. W. C." of California had a
few days of Helena's zero weath

steps and aid his digestion.
C. H. Sipes. Wall, Pa. -Enclosed

which it is hoped, will pay my
subscription until normal condi
tions and prices again- prevail.
The Pittsburgh papers doubled
their price without giving any
such opportunity as The Fulton
County News has done.
Martin L. Fittman, Dayton,
O. I find I cannot get along
without the Fulton, County
News, so find enclosed three dol
lars for back subscription and
renewal. I always find in it
something about friends I would
not otherwise hear from, and
other news from my old home.
I want to say for the benefit of
old friends in Fulton County that
Job Hill is in very poor health
here in Dayton. Fulton County

We are hcving zero weather but
not much snow.
B. Frank Covalt, Johnstown,

are having very cold weather.
Nine degrees below zero this
morning and the roads are bad

"Clarence O. Barton, Forest
City.'Iowa, All of the farmers
here are thru shucking corn.
The crop is a good quality, but
not very much of it I raised
about 1600 bushels of corn on the
farm I am on. If some of the
Fulton county farmers would
raise that much, they would
think they had some crop, while
Educational Meeting.
The sixth local institute of Ayr
township was held at Rock Hill

Soy Bean A Promising Crop.
Notable progress has been made
in bringing about the commercial
utilization of the soybean seed
for the manufacture of oil, meal,
and various more or less complex
products, according to the annual
report to the Chief of the Bureau
of Plant Industry. The soy bean,
the report states, is well adapted
to the whole cotton belt and in
deed to the whole corn region.
In the cotton belt it promises to
be an important element wher
ever the acreage of cotton has
been reduced. The immature
bean seeds make a very delicious
vegetable and are canned with
ease. Inasmuch as soy beans
can be more cheaply produced
than any other bean seed, it is
believed that there is a large
field for the canning of green soy
beans. Efforts are now being
m ade to canning factories to put
the product on the market In
the growing of the soy bean and
in manufacturing products there
from the United States can suc
cessfully compete with the Orient.

Letter to the Editor
Homestead, Pa., Dec. 12
My Dear Mr. Peck: In extend
ing my subscription for the
News, I desire to Bay that, while
not a resident of your County
for many years, yet through the
columns of your good paper, I
have kept fairly well posted con
cerning your social and business
affairs and note with interest
your public improvements.
The reconstruction of the old
"pike" now the Lincoln High
way, has certainly facilitated
travel, besides being of much
benefit in general; and should the
construction of your proposed
railroad be carried to completion
as I trust it may, you will have
increased advantages for the
shipment of your produce.
However, whie we are mindful
of these improvements let us not
forget the glad tidings which
the good people of your adjoin
ing County, in the State of Mary
land conveyed to you through
the returns of the recent elec
tion. The voting of John Barleycorn
out of business will certainly
count in the interest of good,
for surely a business that will
in no way benefit its patrons,
but on the contrary destroy man
hood, fosters 'poverty and crime,
is a menace to the public weal
and should be denounced b y
every honorable man and woman.
Many of your people, especially
in the lower end of the County,
do much of their trading in Han
cock, hence, it can be readily
seen how the presence of a saloon
is a source of evil, for example,
the individual who is addicted to
the drink habit is influenced by
the presence of a saloon and
usually to the neglect of business
the bar-room becomes his retreat:
then we have the so-called tem
perate man and the personal lib
erty man who frequently find
their way into the bar-room that
they may indulge their boasted
liberty with a social glass and
friendly chat, but alas! soon the
alcohol has an exhilarating effect
and they become possessed of an
exalted imagination which us
ually suggests another drink
then the game of the bar-room
is on, and many times the would
be good citizen goes home intox
icated, when, but for the bar
room he would have gone home
sober.
It has been said: "The saloon
is a recruiting station, a training
school for the inebriate army,"
this is doubtless true, then let us
strive to eliminate this legalized
promoter of intemperance.
In this age of activity of stren
uous effort there is a growing
demand everywhere for greater
efficiency; this means men who
can see clearly, think quickiy
and correctly, do their work with
safety, with diligence and do it
rightly. By scientific investiga
tion and physical test, it is evi
dent that only the sober man
can possess these qualities, hence
there is no place for the drinking
man. Our great railroads will
not have him, our manufacturing
plants do not want him, our com
mercial interests reject him, and
now since it is well understood
that alcohol lessens physical en
durance the drinking man has
no standing even in the sporting
world it is the total abstainer
with cool judgment the clear
eye and physical endurance that
inspires you with confidence' on
the athletic field.
With our present knowledge of
the evil effects of alcohol upon
the human system there can be
but two reasons why intelligent
men should advocate its use as a
beverage: they either have learn
ed to like it and would seek an
excuse for its use, or else they
are interested in the traffic.

VENTILATORS.
Little Talks on DealtlTand tygiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, 51. D, LL D.,
Commissioner of Health.
The question of proper ventila
tion during the winter months
is one which it is quite difficult
for many people to solve.
It is apparent to almost every
body that the admission of pure
air is necessary if efficient work
is to be performed in office and
school and if refreshing sleep is
desired by night The fresh air
does not depend upon the tem
perature and can be supplied by
a proper heating and ventilating
system.
The opening of windows while
it admits the fresh air, often
causes drafts which are uncom
fortable, not to say injurious.
Where a number of people are
occupied in a room it is often a
cause of subjecting one or two to
exposure if the windows are
opened to secure ventilation.
This can be avoided by an ample
supply of warmed air.
Numerous devices, more or
less expensive, have been placed
on the market but are not always
satisfactory. The most econom
ical and at the same time prob
ably the most efficient ventilat
ing device is one made of glass
or wood eight or ten inches in
height and made the width of
the sash. This should be placed
under the sash with a slant from
the bottom to the top at an angle
of 45 degrees, leaving an open
ing at the top covered with
cheese cloth.
Ventilators of this sort are so
simple that they can be made at
small cost anywhere and the cov
ering can be readily replaced.
They are suitable for office and
school room, living rooms and
bedrooms. They permit reason
able ventilation without too great
a loss of heat and prevent that
stuffiness of atmosphere which is
dangerous to health and destruc-
tive to real comfort during the .
winter months. This device
leaves an opening between the
upper and lower sash through
which the used air of the room
may escape.
Why Bens Don't Lay.
Why don't hens lay at this time
of the year?
They do, if their owner is on
to his job. It is about as natural
for a hen to lay in the fall and
winter as it is for roses to bloom
at the same season.
But the expertpoultryman now
adays with his modern methods
of breeding, of feeding, of hous
ing and of handling haa his hens
to lay two hundred or more eggs
per year and to lay a goodly num
ber of these in the fall and win
ter. Can an ordinary farmer or
small poultry keeper get a good
fall and winter yield of eggs?
He can if he will have a prop
erly built house not meaning an
expensive one, but a house that
poultry use and live in and can't
be kept out of.
. He can if he will feed the mod
ern way or feed all grain in lit
ters; feed bee-scrap3, fish scraps
or milk animal protein heavily
feed dry mashes and perhaps wet
mashes.
Question like the above ars
now flooding the Pennsylvania
Department of Agriculture and
the replies are broadly like the
above.
Theoutstanding feature of most
of these letters is the fact that
these writers manifestly believe
that if they can learn what to
feed their hens, they must lay.
That feed, good feed, or plenty
of feed, will make hens lay ia a
great if popular fallacy.-
The Department wishes to
especially emphasize that fecun
dity and persistency in laying
are inherited factors and that us
ually, if a flock is to lay well it
must be out of a flock ahead of
it that has laid well. And that
this is the factor that means the
difference between hens not lay.
ing at all and laying well at this -season,
