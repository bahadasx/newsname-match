WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. President

COBWEB SALOON
The Cobweb saloon, in the State
Bank building,' at the corner of
Brotigher avenue and St. Patrick
street, was held up this morning
about 3 o'clock by two masked men
who got away with about $650, the
contents ot the cash register and
what money was on the tables.
When the robbery occurred, nine
men were in the saloon, with George
Dickson behind the bar. The side
door on St. Patrick street was locked
and the corner entrance was bolted.
The stick-ups came In by the doors
opening on the vestibule of the office
entrance of the building. One was
above medium height and the other
was short and stout. Both had bags
over their heads, with holes tor the
eyes and mouth. The men threw
down guns as they entered and
ordered the ' crowd to stand up
against the wall with hands elevated.
Then they proceeded to help them
selves to all the money In sight.
When this had been secured and
thrown Into a sack the men backed
out ot the door by which they
entered. As they made their exit
they warned their victims to remain
quiet, and, to impress th Injunction
more forcibly, fired one shot Into the
saloon.
Nothing is known of th men, al
though It la believed that they are
resident of Tonopah who were
familiar with local conditions.
After firing the only shot the
robber disappeared. Th street was

Wholly without notice and entirely

away In that direction. ,
Some minute elapsed before the
alarm was given and when the call
reached the police station both offi
cers. Bob Dalzell and Tom Griswold,
were inside. They responded imme
diately, but could not find any trace.
They are inclined to believe the men
came from Ooldfield, where a saloon
was held up three nights ago,as the
description tally.
The saloon patrons were not mo
lested. Dickson was ordered from
behind the bar to join his customers
Btanding against the wall and then
the register was ' emptied and the
money of the games wa quietly
packed off in the sack. '
Th Cobweb has. been unfortunate,
as only a year and a halt ago
a previous bold-up .occurred. At that
time the robbers secured $778, of
which $170 was taken front; cus

In a game at that time had a $300
diamond ring on on finger which he
succeeded in twisting around so that
when he raised his hand against the

to all the neutrals for their informa
tion. Summarised in the- president's own
words, as contained in the notes, his
attitude is as follows: '
Not Offering Mediation
"The president is not proposing
peace; he is not even offering media
tion. He is merely proposing that
soundings be taken in order that we
may learn, the neutral nations, with
the belligerent, how near the haven
neutrals and the United Statea itself
was being drawn near the verge of
war. "
Ambassador Ton Bernstorff con
ferred with Lansing today, when be
discussed the president's action.
Tbe German allies long, have hoped
tor such action, by the president.
Von Bernstorff declared: , "Now I am
perfectly convinced there will be a
conference."
The note are regarded of such a
nature as to compel tbe belligerents
to make more ot ' a reply than a
mere acknowledgement.
! Late this afternoon Secretary Lan
sing authorized a statement regard
ing the president' reason for the
note. "It isn't our material interest
we had in mind," he said, "but our
own rights are becoming Involved by
the belligerents on both sides, so the
situation is Increasingly critical. We
mean by that, we are drawing nearer
th verge of war ourselves. There
fore we are entitled to know exactly
what each belligerent seeks, in order
to regulate our conduct. No nation
was sounded before the note was
sent. The president in his notes
specifically denies this 1 a move
ment ' In aid of tbe German over
tures, a might be construed. The
only thing the overtures did was to
delay It for a few days."
Lansing said further: "The send
ing of this note will indicate the pos
sibility of our being forced Into war.
That possibility ought to serve as a
restraining, sobering force in safe
guarding American rights. It may
also serve to force an early conclu
sion of the war that neither tbe
president nor myself regard as a
peace note. The note is merely an
effort to get tbe belligerents to de-
une me ena tor which the are
fighting."

the spirit In which be speaks and the'
objects which be seeks will be undei
stood by all concerned, and be con-'
fidently hopes for a response which1
will bring a new light into th
affair of the world." ,
This latest development ; in th
rapidly moving world events toward
a discussion ot peace wa sot per
mitted to become known until' ntd-'
night, when the note were wall on
their way to the American am bas-,
sadors in the belligerent capital,
and probably already in the band ot
some of them.
Surprise to Washington
It was a moat distinct surprise to
I all official Washington, which had .
ES,
been led to believe that with th
formal transmission of the proposal
ot the central power the office of
the United States would await far-'
tber moves between the belligerent
themselves, and that . certainly. Ins
view of the' speech of Premier Lloyd ,
George and the announcement In
Russia, ' Franco and Udy, further'-"
action by neutral would depend upon '
the next careful and delicate move
of the belligerent. The whole tenor ?
ot official opinion, throughout. Wash-
ington, when the president' attitude
became known, was that It Immeasur
ably Improved the prospects for some
sort of exchanges looking toward an
approach to peace discussion - be
tween the belligerents, without im-
pairing tbe position of the United
Statea should they Anally be unable
to find a ground on which to ap
proach one another.
Surrounded by Secrecy
At the White House no statement
whatever could be obtained as to
whether any of the powers even had
Intimated how they would receive the ;
note, and there was every Indication
that the same careful secrecy which
prevented anything whatever becom-
ing known about the president' ac
tion, until it had been taken, would
surround any of tbe succeeding
moves..
Nowhere on the surface appear
any Indications of the history making
events which diplomats generally are -convinced
must have transpired, since
the German allies brought forth their
proposals to dispel the generally
prevalent belief that such an action
on the part of President Wilson '
would be unacceptable to the entente
powers.
British Unable to Explain
British embassy officials declared
thay were utterly taken by surprise,
were wholly unable to explain It, and
were emphatic In their statement '
that no exchanges whatever had
passed through the embassy here a
a preliminary.
