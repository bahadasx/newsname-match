Wnlth and Decay.
Roaie was once where the Uni
ted States is today the great
est, strongest, richest nation of
the known world. Rome rotted to
death from wealth, luxury and
sloth. The internal relation of her
people and her conduct towards
other people were directed by
the law of the jungle. We can
share Rome's fate only by imita
ting Rome. Because we are in a
world infinitely greater than
Rome knew we can hold it inpow
er and place far beyond the wild
est vision of the proudest Ro
mans if only we will learn from
the fate of the people who have
lived before us and have misera
bly failed; learn to regard the
highest ideals as real and power
ful things; accept as a firm con
viction the belief that as a na
tion Providence and circumstan
ces have entrusted us with an ex
alted mission.
Had the teachings of the great
Emperor Augustus been been fol
lowed Rome would have remain
ed unshaken. It is easy to know
that if this nation of ours is giv
en over to luxury and riot, to
huge wealth unevenly divided, to
effeminacy on the one hand and
misery and rags on the other,
ourdestruction will come surely,
swiftly and shamefully, without
even the alleviation of pity or
sympathy, with all the added ig
nominy of the world's contempt
and the knowledge that we will
ive in history not as an exam
ple of grandeur, but as another
nstanceof disgraceful failure.

troller of tne currency.

Thi Oni Assoranci.
Charlotte Obseraer,
The best that may he said of
the prospect for peace is that
the Washington Government,
through which channel the nego
tiations must pass, will surely be
disposed to take advantage of
any possible chauce the German
overture may afford of forward
ing the cause of peace. The Ob
server has entertained the be
lief that the rough proposal of
Germany may have that behind
it which will lead to the stage of
conference. That much accomp
lished the reasonable hope might
be entertained that the first ap
proach on the question of a ter
mination of the war and the es
tablishment of peace may happily
materialize. It is to be borne in
mind that the terms Germany
purposes to submit are not known
The first object was to secure a
conference. That being done, the
representations of the German
Government would be in ordpr,
and these representations being
made known, the public would be
in better position to speculate
upon the possible success of the
movement or its futility. Until
what Germany has to say on the
conditions for peace is forthcom
ing, there is ground for hope that
tqe outcome may be successful.
Neither England nor the United
States at this time has exact
knowledge of what Germany may
propose, and the duty devolves
upon them to await a definite
statement. It is for the Allies to
say that they would welcome
this statement, and that beinn
done Germany would be at liberty
to go into details of her proposi
tion. It is not a one-sided af
fair. Germany could not expect
to demand all, nor could the Al
lies ,be expected to concede all
that the German initial might
cover. If the German offer should
prove one whose acceptance could
not be discussed, the peace af
fair would be at an end. On the
contrary, should a conference be
arranged and the proposals take
ashapetbat would engage the
attention of the Allied powers, it
would invite the opening of a
long course diplomatic take-and-give
in the direction of a final a-
greement. The German proposal
could not be rejected until sub
mitted for consideration. Until
this is done, the world must live
in suspense and hope for the best.
The one assurance is that if, in
the present situation, a prospect
for peace can be found, thatpros-
pect will not be permitted to fail
unless the Washington Govern
ment itself should fail. However
feeble the prospects might be,
ib would receive the earnest at
tention of a resourceful and pow
erful Nation, one skilled in the
adminisration of diplomatic na
ture, and one whose good offices
would be welcomed and whose
recommendations would be re
spected. .Once the United States
mignt De permitted to take a
baud in beinging the warring peo
pie to terms there certainly would
be ground to nope tor a success
ful termination to a proposition
that at first may have looked so
doubtful
Now Lookout.
When a cold hangs on as often
bapppens, or when you have
nardly gotten over one cold be
fore you contract another, look
out for you are liable to contract
another, look out for you are li
aba to contract some very sen
ous disease. This succession of
colds weakens the system v and
lowers the vitality so that you
aie much more liable to coutract
chronic catarrh, pneumonia or
consumption. Cure your culd
wbile you can. Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy has a great repu
tation. It is relied upon by thou
sands of people and never dicap
poiuts tbeui. Try it. it ouly
costs a quarter. Obtainable every
