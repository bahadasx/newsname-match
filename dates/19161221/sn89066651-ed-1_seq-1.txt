The story we are about to tell
the'story of Hayti, Missouri
sounds like a fairy talc.
Twenty-three years ago the
site upon which Hayti stands,
was the Hayes and Oates
farms. Surrounding these was
a scattered settlement. A few
acres here and there were in
cultivation. Only the highest
lands were tilled. Ninety-percent
of the territory was an un
broken forest, filled lakes, la
goons and swamps. Blind roads,
from settlement to settlement,
ran through canebrakes, and the
overlapping branches of the tall
trees shut ouc the sun. Wild
animals ran at will across the
way. Wildcats and wolves fre
quently scampered into the
jungles with a threatening growl,
at the approach of man; deer ran
away only to look buck with
startled, staring eyes, as if
ashamed to be afraid; now and
then, a black bear, taken by
surprise, with a startled snort,
lunged into the tangled under
growth, and tore a new trail for
those who cared to follow. The
lakes and bayous were the home
of many a fowl of strange feath
er, and the waters were filled
with most every species of the
finny tribe. Under these con-
warmed one-room, log-built
homes, a soggy, blue smoke
lazily curled up and mingled into
the deep shade of towering trees.
But the wants of the people were
few and they were happy. Most
everybody had the chills and a
bottle of quinine. If they didn't
have one or both they were not
considered good livers, nor good
providers. There were no
screens upon the doors and win
dows, and the mosquitoes saw
that no one suffered with a sur
plus of blood. Those who object
ed to having their skins made a
sieve of by these myriads of
pestiferous insects, combatted
them with smokes and smudges
that filled the lungs to suffoca
tion. When night came, those
who did not sleep under mo
squito netting did not sleep at
all
These statements, of course,
refer mainly to the backwoods
district, but most of the districts
were backwoods, then, churches
and schools were few and far be
tween. On the Hayes farm
where now sits Hayti there was
a little one-room school building,
at which school was taught a few
months in the year. Preaching
was also held once a month.
Gayoso was the county seat, and
farm.
Levees, drainage canals and
railroads were practically un
thought of. Those who did
speak of such things verof call
ed dreamers and fanatics, or
were looked upon as harmless
sort of imbecils.
Then came a change. As if
touched with a magic wand, the
face of nature was transformed.
Aladdin with his wonderful
Arabian lamp, could not have
worked greater wonders than
did Louis Houck, when he
brought his railroad from the
Cotton Belt through the Little
swamp, stretched it across the
Hayti ridge, and tied it to the
Mississippi at uarutnersvine.
But before the railroad, came
the levee. That was the beginn
ing. Had it not been for the
levee there would have been no
railroads, no drainage canals, no
highly improved farms, no broad,
smooth highways. There would
have been no wheat Holds, no
broad acres of alfalfa Hayti
would have been a small forest
and lake surrounded, field, as it
was, instead of a city of nearly
3,000 people as it is today. In
stead of the $25,000 public school
building we have now today,
there would have been the little

ditlons hunting and traping was
a leading industry. Many were
satisfied if they had a ten-acre
farm, with a one room log cabin
on it, two coon-dogs and half a
dozen steel traps. A scent,
which only the primeval woods
yield, and which only the pioneer
citizens knows, filled the air with
a heavy miasmatic breath. From
the stick and dirt chimneys that
Hayti was on the county road.
That was about the only advant
age the locality had over other
neighborhoods.
Land, on the average, was
worth from $1.50 to $25,00 per
acao, More was to be had at
the latter price than at the form
er. A good coon dog was con
sldorad worth more than a small

stagnant lakes have boon tapped

and inseparable, have automatic

Our people are as healthy,
happy and prosperous, as peo

roaring, rushing giddy traffic
mad world.
Lands that could be bought for
$1.50 an acre, now, when for sale
at all, brings from $100.00 to
$200.00. Instead of small patch
es, and log huts with mud chim
neys, the scone streaches away
to the horizon, a dazzling picture
of modernized agriculture, with
barns, silos and farm homes of
commodious proportions. In
stead of the blind neighborhood
paths, are broad smooth high
ways, over which highpowered
automobiles spin, freighted with
happy, prosperous people.
Twenty three years ago there
was not a railroad in Pemiscot
county. Today we have the
main lino of the great St. Louis
and San Francisco system, with
its branch lines, and other local
lines, stretching over the land
like titantic spider web. Hayt;
besides being on the main sys
tern, also has a line of the east
and west division, and twenty
five or thirty trains pass daily
Twenty-three years ago if you
wanted to go from tiayn xo ol.
Louis, you went to Gayoso, and
waited there for a boat. Night
and day you peered up and down
the river for sight of the steamer
several days overdue. It finally
came between midnight ard
day that was generally the w.i,
of it. You -went aboard, nnd
when you looked out the next
morning you still found the
steamer tied to the bank putting
on and off freight, while the mate
bellowed like an enraged bovine
at the tired rousters, who roust
ed and sang something about the
RobLeeand the Natchez. About
midnight, after two or three
days, the steamer, finally dump
ed you at the St. Louis wharf,
under the shadow of the Eads
bridge. If you went to Mem
phis, Louisville or Cincinnati,
you had practically the same ex
perience. Now if you wish to go
to St. Louis you take a sleeper at
12 p. m., and eat your breakfast
In that city tho next morning.
According to the Federal cen
sus thero wero but 9,000 people
in Pemiscot county in 1900; in
1910 there wero 19,559, and ac
cording to this increase our pop
ulationnow is not less than 25,000.
There are on the tax books of
Pemiscot county 1111,845 acres of
the most fertile laud on the globe.
Tho Valley of the Nile does not
surpass It In fertility and pro
ductiveness. The total assessed
value of real and personal prop
erty in Pemiscot county, in tho
year 19111, was $3,702,503. And
that, of course, was threo years
ago, with a schedule of less than
half value,
Tho cotton crop of Pemiscot
county in 1914 was something
over 23,000 bales; in 1915, about
half that and it is estimated there
will be 20,000 bales this year. At
20 cents a pound this looks like
prosperity.
Cotton produces from a half to
a bale to the acre with ordinary
cultivation, but with proper at
tention should as easily yield two
bales. Corn produces from 25
to 75 bushels per aero; wheat, 15
to 35, and from four to five crops
of alfalfa hay is the usual harvest.
Anything that will grow in this
climate, in the way of fruits and
vegetables, grow hereto perfec
