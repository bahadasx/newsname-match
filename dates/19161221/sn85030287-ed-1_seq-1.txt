Government statistics
show that: v.
Every minute 21 persons
are accidentally injured.
Every 5 minutes one per
son is accidentally killed.
11.000,000 are killed and
injured yearly.
This means 30,000 each
day.
Five times as many per
sons are killed and injured each year as die from natural
causes.
Out of 20,000,000 cases of disability that occur each year
only five per cent are fatal. Just think of it! Life insur
ance only covers five per cent, and Health and Accident In
surance covers 95 per cent'.
Does Not the Law of Average Say Your turn is Next?

A MERRY CHRISTMAS
Departed
M A. Bird, one of the oldest
and best known citizens of this
county, was the victim tf a fatal
accident, Saturday, December
16th.
Mr. Bird had been in Dodge
City on business and was on his
way home. About-six. miles east
of Montezuma, something hap
pened, hut just what, will never
be known, as he was alone in
the car, a Ford, at the time.
Ta'O theories have been ad
vanced. One is that he had
a stroke of appoplexy, and that
the car did not leave the road
until life was extinct.
The other, and the more plaus
able is that he lost control of it,
and was caught beneath it when
it turned turtle.
The deceased was born in
Sullivan County Missouri, May
30, 1878. Came to Kansas in
1884 an 1 with bis parents locat
ed in Gray c6unty. Later he
proved up a claim in Meade
county. On January 29, 1905
he was married to Miss Luella
Cumback. ' To this uriion six
children were born
His wife two girls, three boys,
his mother, Mrs. Isabelle Bird,
who lives in Gray county, three
brothers, Rlwood, of Gray coun
to, Gilbert, who resides in this
county, and B , of Enid, Okla
homa, and three sisters, Mrs.
Pillsbury, of Enid, Oklahoma,
Mrs. Pugh, of Alva, Oklahoma,
and Mrs. Yount, of Haskell
county, survive.
Funeral services were held
Tuesday afternoon at the M. E
Church. After a short service,
conducted by Rev. S. M. Hunt,
the Masonic funeral service was
read, and concluded at the grave
in Graceland cemetery.
Mr. Bird was engaged in the
Mercantile business at Missler.
Winter
Meade people experienced a
decided change in the weather
Tuesday. It came on almost
without warning, and in a few
hours timeconditions had chang
ed from almost summer-like
weather to a real old time bliz
zard. The wind blew and some
snow fell. Tuesday andWed
nesday night the thermometer
hovered around ten below. Dur
ing the past two days it has
moderated to some extent.
There will be services at the
Catholic church Christmas morr
ing at six o clock. All are welcome.
Dr. Koush has moved to his
new office on West Carthage
Avenue. Saturday afternoon a
reception was given by Dr. and
Mrs. Roush to patients and
friends. More than three hun
dred invitations were issued.
The guests were shown through
the new building, which is mod
ern in every respect. Punch
was served and white carnations
given as favors. Dr. Roush has
been in Meade but a short time,
but has built up a big practice.
His new office building is a credit
to our city.
