Montana Youth Sends Engine
Running Wild After Reaching
Destination.
Bozeman, Mont.—"By George, I'm go
ing to that dance at Paxton's some
how!" an unknown young man declar
ed here when informed there would be
no trains going east for some time. He
walked over to a lone locomotive, en
tered the cab and started east, break
ing through a closed switch and going
out on the main line.
Engineer McVlcker in a locomotive
was traveling toward this city when he
noticed the block system registered
danger. He saw the smoke of an en
gine approaching and stopped his en
gine. His fireman jumped, and Mc
Vlcker reversed his engine. Fireman
tioehllng caught the approaching en
gine, climbed into the cab, found it
"driverless" and brought it to a stop a
short distance from McVicker'a engine.
No trace of the locomotive thief has
been found. He evidently jumped when
he saw the other engine approaching.

only one in a period of two hours dur
lug a thunderstorm here recently,
struck and completely demolished a
huge locust tree which was more than
a century old, and was a well known
landmark on the farm of E. F. Davis.
The tree was over a hundred feet high,
and there was not a branch withiu
forty feet of the ground.
Mr. Davis said that he not long ago
refused an offer of $100 for the tree
from a man who wanted the trunk for
a pole. He did not sell it, he said, as
his father had always argued that the
tree should be left where it stood be
cause it might some day be hit by
lightning which otherwise might hit
the barns close by.
TEMPLE OF DISHONESTY.
It Will Have the Form of House, and
All the Parts Are Stolen.
Los Angeles.—Somebody is building
a temple of dishonesty in the form of
a house, of which all the component
parts are stolen.
Now the thieves are stealing the
doors. The last case of such thievery
was reported to the police recently by
Mrs. W. H. Hill of 1414 Fedora street
When Mrs. Ilill left home the other
morning the back door was locked
safely on its hinges. When she re
turned two hours later the door was
gone. Other house parts have been
stolen in other neighborhoods recently.
The police are wondering what the
thieves will do when they get around
to making a basement and cement
walk for their homes.

Rail Board Tours Canada.
The railroad commission left recent
ly for a week's tour of Canada in the
prosecution of its investigation intc
the feasibility of terminal elevators,
a duty which was imposed upon the
board by the adoption of the terminal
elevator amendment at the recent gen
eral election.
The commission was to visit Winni
peg, Regina and Port Arthur and was
to then drop down through Wisconsin
and Minnesota to investigate terminal
elevator conditions there.
The board was also to consider the
question as it is affected by the feder
al inspection and grading of grain, and
it hopes to be in position to present
an intelligent and comprehensive re
port to the fifteenth general assem
bly.
Several important rate cases will be
left over for the new commissioners
to wrestle with. These will include
the express rates on cream, protested
by the Grand Forks-commercial club,
and the inter-state freight rates pro
test of the Fargo Commercial club,
both of which will be heard in Jan
uary.
Would Vindicate Worst.
A demand upon the legislature that
It "recognize John H. Worst, former
president of the North Dakota agricul
tural college by electing him president
emeritus of the college," is made by
the Co-operative Herald, th Society of
Equity paper.
Mr. Worst has twice been elected
president emeritus, each time by the
board's governing institution, but the
tender was made under conditions
"humiliating and unjustified," and
each time it was refused, says the
Herald.
The announcement by the publica
tion is taken as indicating Worst's
personal attitude on the question, and
the proposition practically is assured
of being given legislative attention.
Restrains Hanna's Order.
Holding that they had voted them
selves salary to which they were not
entitled, for services which were never
performed that they had rendered
bills in excess of the legal limit, in
favor of themselves and had voted
their payment that they had violated
the statutes in failing to advertise for
bids on bridge work whose cost ex
ceeded $100 and that they had voted
the county surveyor a larger salary
than the statutes provide, Governor
B. Hanna has ordered removed from
office Chairman William Colgrove and
Commissioners John A. Rieger and
Paul F. Schmidt of the Hettinger
county board.
To Change Regent's Law.
The Society of Equity interests her«
have launched propaganda for an
amendment to the state board of re
gents law that would increase the
membership to five and make the com
missioner of agriculture and the super
intendent of public instruction ex-offi
cio members.
Iir addition the creation of separate
educational boards to govern the ag
ricultural college and institutions
teaching industries and agriculture ii
proposed.
For City Ownership.
Comprehensive legislation to make
effective a more general establishment
of municipally-owned public utilities
will be presented to the North Dako
ta legislature this winter as a result
pf the action of the Fargo Trades and
Labor assembly, which has placed
under way in Fargo a movement for
the establishment by that city of a
municipally-owned electric power
plant. Preliminary steps have been
taken, it is announced.

Endorsement tor the Dickinson NOP

the educational survey conducted in
North Dakota a year ago by Comniis
Bioner of Education E. B. Craighead,
with the assistance of P. P. Claxton,
United States commissioner of educa
tion, and the latter's staff.
While the recognition conies too late
to have any effect on the recent elec

nearly 20,000 indicates that it was not
needed, it is gratifying to friends o(
the new institution to find its cstab I

ANNOUNCEMENT
We beg to annouuce the closing of our Local Office at Hope until March first next'
when, at that time, we will open up with a stronger force and a greater determination
than ever to sell lands tributary to Hope. We have had a splendid business, particular
ly so, considering the unfavorable year for selling land. We attribute a great deal of
our success to the loyal manner iu which the people of the town and the farmers in
general, stuck by and boosted the town, the country and this Company. We appreciate
these things as it helps more than hundreds of dollars worth of advertising, not only to
us but to your own community as well. We found no knocking in Hope among the farm
ers or business uieu, or any one else. This means something. It means better busi
ness, more business, more activity, in all lines and a pleasanter place to live.
You will have a number of good substantial farmers from other states move into
your community in the spring, tlnough the efforts ol' this Company, and we hope you
will receive them, which we know you will, with a glad hand and encouraging words,
which means much to the new-comer. If he feels the hand of encouragement he will
not get homesick after the first year but will send the word back home and scores of
others will follow him. The way to build up a country is to get good people and good
settlers into it.
Again thanking you for your loyal support and hoping next year will be the best
and grandest of all, and wishing you a Merry Christmas, we are,
Sincerely,
P. S. Immediately after January first, we will begin soliciting listings and pre
paring our field books for 1917 business. If you have land you desire to sell, we strong
ly urge listing early as the sooner we complete our lists, the sooner we can get them to
our agents, and your farm may be the one to attract their customer. Remember
