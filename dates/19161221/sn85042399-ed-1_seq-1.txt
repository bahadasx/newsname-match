Wheels Go Around
The council met in adjourned ses
sion Wednesday evening with two
vitally interested spectators, Mayor
elect Lamkln and Councilman-elect
Caldwell. Mayor Johnson was ab
sent during the early portion of the
meeting, but Mr. Lamkln refused an
offer to "practice up" by holding
down the chair, and Councilman Ash
craft, who Is president of the council,
called the meeting to order.
The minutes, recorder's report and
other routine business waft attended
to.
Two new street lights were or
dered. The street committee reported that
they had concluded to reject the pe
tition of a few North Ashland resi
dents for opening up Willow street.
Mr. Walker stated that the whole
matter evolved from a dispute over
whether the land had been deeded for
street purposes in order that a man's
property line could be established
and residents of the section wanted
to know whether they had to fence
thet street.
A lengthy report with pertinent
recommendations from the electric
light committee was read and filed.
An ordinance establishing sewer
district No. 18 and levying Bpecial
assessments was adopted.
The council then adjourned into a
canvassing board to canvass the elec
tion results.
Christmas Rush

mined "shop early" campaign has
lightened it con3lderably, Is here
again. The stores will be open even

wives should prepare for Sunday and
the Christmaa holiday In succession
by providing all needs Friday or Sat
urday. The schools will close Friday

The postoffice is the busiest place
of all. Most pf the outgoing parcels
have been mailed, but the Incoming
mail is growing heavier dally and the
postmen are unrecognizable , under
great stacks of packages as they start
out on their distribution rounds.

Who Found the Cupboard Hare
Career in Liquor
Business Is Brief
I. Spencer, who claims to hail from
Hilt, Cal., ventured briefly into the
retail liquor business in Ashland with
disastrous results this week. He is
now fifty dollars poorer and wiser.
Chief Porter got wind of his bootleg
ging operations before he had been
in the city more than a day or two.
Two men were sent down to buy
booze with marked money. Spencer
accommodated them, charging two
dollars for a "short quart," or one-
fifth gallon, and three dollars for a
full quart. He sold whiskey from
Warren's saloon at Hilt and from all
appearances good quality stuff, al
though the chief has not allowed any
tests as to Its taste. Chief Porter and
John Wimer then meandered down to
the man's room at the Depot hotel
and arrested him, finding the marked
money all in his pockets and three
more quarts of whiskey which re
mained unpeddled. After spending
Tuesday night in Jail Spencer plead
guilty and was fined fifty dollars, At
torney Kelly conducting the case. He
called upon northern California
friends for the money.
This fa the first bootlegger convict
ed in Ashland for some time, the
proximity to Hilt making the business
unprofitable as long as the roads
were good.
Bad Roads Fail To
Faze Booze Autos
A. L. Church and F. N. Thompson
of Los Angeles, representing the
Auto Club of America, were In this
city yesterday en route from Los An
geles to Seattle on a routing tour.
These gentlemen wjll give out the
report that the Siskiyou Highway is
closed for the winter. They them
selves got through only with the aid
of a team in one or two places.
Right on top of this statement
made yesterday, two cars heavily
loaded with that commodity known
"drinking liquor" arrived last
night and spent the night in a local
garage. They said they were bound
for Albany.

Will Discuss Fish
Problem Tonight
There will be a meeting at 8
o clock tonight at the city hall for
tlie purpose of considering the organ-
j Nation of a rod and gun club, a much
needed organization. The immediate
call for such a club is to enable con -
. certed action for the furthering of
tho sentiment toward the closing of
j Kogue river to commercial fishing.
Ioca' anglers claim that, the steel-
J lose one of its most valuable assets,
the Rogue river fishing, should the
commercial fishing be alowed to con
tinue. The state sportsmen's league
recently voted recommending that the
legislature close the river. C. M.
Thomas and others will probably
speak and every lover of hunting and
fishing Is ui god to attend.

Tie on Matter of
Street Widening
The nii'tter of a deal for a piece of
ground for the widening of Park av-
j enue at the Smith livery stable was
j brought up at Tuesday's council
I meeting. Councilman Banta made a
j strong appeal in favor of leaving the
matter over for the new council to
deal with, also stating that he did not
I favor the proportion.
Mr. Lamb and
Mr. Nlnlnger both voiced the opinion
that it ought to be settled by tho
council which had handled it. Mr.
Banta's motion to carry the matter
over lost. The matter was brought
up Immediately, Councllmen Ash
craft, Lamb and Cornelius voting In
favor of the purchase. Councllmen
Banta, Root and Nlnlnger voted
against the propoistlon, the latter
stating that since Mr. Greer was giv
ing the land necessary from his lot,
he did not see the consistency of pny
iig Mr. Smith for his. Since tho
mayor was not present the matter
remained as a tie and will go over
to the new council despite tho voto
to settle It immediately.
The proposed widening really did
not Include a cash payment to Mr.
Smith, but provided for a deal with
Mrs. Satterfield and Mrs. Leonard for
a strip to be added to the rear of tho
Smith lot of equal proportions with
that deeded to the city.
Those fM-Kuing In favor of the mat-
(ter urged the acceptance of the offer
obtained by the real estato commit
tee, as In their belief It would be tho
lowest possible for a strip of land for
street widening which many conges
tions on Sundays and celebration
days last summer had proved neces
sary. New Street Lights

A number of residents In the
Walker street neighborhood peti
tioned the city council that two

between Welghtman and the Boule

Boulevard. The electric light com
mittee was given power to act in re

were deemed necessary is the cost is
not too excessive.
