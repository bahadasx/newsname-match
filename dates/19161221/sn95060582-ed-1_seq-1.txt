his ice house filled with plenty of
good ice, some of it measuring

thickness, The St. Johns Drug

their ice-house.
Professor W. H Rishel, princi
pal of the Springerville Public
School is in the city attending the
Teachers' Institute. He gave the
Herald boys a pleasant call and
left a little coin for subscription i
to the Herald. He informed us
that on Thanksgiving Day the
pupils of the Springerville Schools
gave an entertainment that was
lai'gely attended by the patrons
and also that the entertainment
was of a very high and pleasing
order.
Benj. Standifird of Alpine has
been in the city for the past two
weeks attending court, while here
he called on the Herald force

crops of vegetables, etc. MostjJude Pei'kins thi"ks that we
of the people living there have a ! have a fine country here and that
few head of good cows and are
prospering. Their winter range,
on the Blue, is good and stock
come out in the spring looking
well. -They have no loco, and
anyone with a little ambition to
work can make things go in that
part of Apache county. Mr.
Standifird thinks that the coun
try in and around St. Johns is an
excellent one and that all it needs
for one to make good in this part
of our State is for them to go to
work with some energy. It some
times takes some one from the
outside of a community to see the
opportunities that surround one
in their own country.
Superior Court Notes.
Last Tussday morning the. Su
perior Court of Apache County
convened the greater part of the
day was taken up in securing the
jury to try the case of Apache
County vs, Fay Sheik for the kill
ing of Leonard Olsen of Houck,
Arizona. The case occupied about
five days and after remaining out
all night the jury returned a ver
dict of guilty of voluntary Man
slaughter and ask the mercy of
the court. The date for passing
sentence was set for Feb. 8, as
an appeal is ask for.
Saturday evening a jury was
empaneled for the case of J. 0.
Smith vs H. J. Piatt. ' The case
was turned over to the jury at 12
o'clock midnight and after re
maining out all night the jury re
turned a verdict of No Cause for

Baca was found guilty on two
charges.
Last Sunday morning Mr. and
Mrs. Joy B. Patterson were made
exceedingly happy by the arrival
of a big boy at their home. This
is their first boy so they are to be
excused for thinking that he is
the only boy in town. We have
experienced the same feelings.
Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Karnes were
also made to rejoice on the
evening of thf same day by the
arrival of a big boy at their home
so this goes to prove that Mr. and
Mrs. Patterson have only got one
boy among many others.

time and patience had been spent

The mail-carrier reports two
inches of snow at Eagar.
Just suppose, you patron of the
mail order house, "that for a per
iod of twelve month's every cit
izen of your county followed your
example and did all of his trading
away from home? Whatcondition
would your county be in? Would
there be a solvent merchant in it?
Not one. What of your schools,
your churches, and all the civiliz
inginstitutions of our land? They
might still survive if you bear all
the expense not otherwise.-Ex.

Danger Signal
If the fire: bell should ring
would you run and stop it or go
help to put out the fire? It "is
much the'saine way with a cough
A cough is a danger signal as
much as a fire bell. You should
no more try to supress it than - o
stop a fire bell when it is ringing
but should cure the disease that
causes the coughing. Thi.3 can
nearly always be done by taking
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy.
Many have used it with the most
beneficial results. It is especially
valuable for the persistent cough
that so often follows a bad cold
or an attack of the grip. Mrs.
Thomas Beeching, Andrews. Ind.
writes: "During the winter my
husband takes cold easily "and
coughs and coughs. Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy is the best
medicine for breaking up these
attacks and you cannot get him
to take any other." Obtainable

Congressman Hayden was suc

plete the diversion dam above
Florence and also obtained $75,-
000 to commence the construction
of the main canal which will car
ry the water from this dam to the
lands belonging "to Indians and
white men in Pinal county. His
request for $125,000 to complete
another diversion dam near Saca-
ton was likewise granted. This
dam will be constructed with- a
bridge superstructure thus pro
viding a much needed means of
crossing the Gila river. $98,000

Springerville,
'A Legitimate KicK.
Los Angeles Examiner.
Inspired by twenty per cent ad
vance in New York laundry bills.
Though food is soaring toward
the sky,
With not a prospect of the tum
ble
I take the grocer's alibi
And do my drendest not to
grumble.
But when the laundry charges me
Five cents for chewing up a
collar
It. formerly destroyed for three,
i think I really have a holler!
The butcher blames the boost in
meat
Upon the packer and the drover.
I still believe that HE'S the beat,
But yet I let him put it over.
But when the laundry asks a dime
For eight cents' worth of ma
ceration Of shirts and such, it's long past
time
For patience or for resignation.
The clothiers blame the jobbers,
for
The fact that things to wear
are higher,
And other merchants blame the
war
For other things that I desire.
But when the laundry asks more
pelf,
For devastating my apparel.
Why I'll destroy the stuff myself:
And save ti money by the barrel.
Everyone who comes in these
days and pay the printer is blessed
and in the kingdom to come he
He sins as much who "hold the
bag as he who puts into it.
