CIRCUIT COURT
Adjourns With Deckels Practically Cleaud
The three weeks term of the Novem
ber circuit court came to a close last
Saturday, which left the dockets prac
tically cleared. Hut for the case
against the 1. & N railroad which took
up about ten days of the session, the
docket could have been handled in
much less time. After serving the
alotted time of six days tho grand
jury adjourned returning in nil about
21 indictments mctttly for misdemean
ors. The jury in the case of George
Conn against tho L & N railroad who
sued for $2,000 damages caused by the
Hood of March 1913, it being charged
that on account of the butineuts of the I
bridge, the water was turned from!

Its original course, tnrouRii tne prop

The Christmas spirit in in the air and

Hundreds of sacks of candy, apples,

old and under will receive these gilts.
At this season of the year the one
great thought that thrums in Xhe heart
of every unselfish person is what can I
give my friends to increase their hap
piness? It is only a crabbed, sordid
soul at this crowning summit of the
year who asks what am I going to re
ceive. Children expect to receive and
are happv in the thought, but rightly
balanced adults find their chief pleasure
in giving.
.The glaoVjoyous, festal time draws
near and unnumbered hearts are beat
ing in delightful anticipation. The
holly and evergreen hang in festoons,
and the wonderful municipal tree has
been placed in the park with its count
less lights and decorations. Let hearts
expand, sympathies enlarge and good
will reign. Let the men, women and
children of Ijmcnster get together as
never before.
The south has long followed the cus
toms of Herrie England in the matter
of bringing in from wood and field the
beautiful Christmas greens with whicn
to give home and church festival air;
but from the pine lands of Maine to
the mistletoe haunts of California, from
the creeping ground-pines of northern
Wisconsin to the high parasite greens
down in Hawaii, we all have learned
how to keep Christmas, l'oor indeed is

The sale will be a big one and those
