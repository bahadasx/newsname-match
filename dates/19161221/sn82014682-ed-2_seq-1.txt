when Dr. 'Raymond expressed bitter
ness over a rebuff he said he had re
ceived at the governor's office, came
today in a signed statement, by Mrs.
EL p. Matson, stenographer, in the
governor's office.
The statement says:
"Dr. J. H. Raymond called on the
governor on Tuesday morning, De
cember 19, about 11 o'clock. The gov
ernor being engaged, Dr. Raymond
aald that he would wait As soon as
tbe governor was alone he was in
formed that the doctor was waiting
to 6ee him. He requested that the
doctor be Informed that, after having
been engaged with different persons
all morning, he was just attempting to

could see him on Wednesday morning
instead. This message was delivered
and Dr. Raymond said, 'Certainly, that
would be all right. or words to that
effect, and appeared to be quite agree
able. This incident occurred in the
absence of Mr. Wayne from the
office."

Recommendation that the city sew

property tax, will probably be passed
tonight at the special meeting of the

culcated in the report which that body
will make to the legislature.
. Charles H. Merriam, who has care
fully followed the work of the com

sounded the various members in re
gard to the abolishment of the indivi
dual sewer tax, expressed the belief
today that the recommendation will

'"Thin is (hp B vstpm hpinp- follovrpd
by most of the mainland states," said
Merriam, "and the general belief is
that it is proper. It is not fair to tax
persons specifically for a sanitary pre
caution. It Is possible that we may
bring up the Idea of a 'betterment'
tax. which will charge for installation
of the sewer line but for nothing afterward."';-.
Harry Murray, water works man
ager. Is heartily in favor of the plan
and expressed the hope today that it
will pass. He says It is fairer -for all
citizens to pay for seweYs than for
certain individuals, " who live where
cesspools cannot be substituted. The
general tax would not amount to more
than " 75 cents per $1000 a year, he
says.

fl REQUFEQIVEW
TVAIAHOLE FLOW
VELt AHEAD OF
EARLY FIGURES
Water Secured is More Than
" Twice Estimate When Pro
ject Was Undertaken
: For the past, few months reports
have persistently declared that the
water flow from the Walahole project
which irrigates the Oahu plantation
was not satisfactory and was a disap
pointment to the officers and directors
of the company.
'That the reports are absolutely un
true and that the flow far exceeds the
amount expected and eves hoped for,
was the statement made today by both
Georg Rodtek, treasurer, and J. F. C
Hagen. secretary, of the Walahole
Water Company. -
Charts of the flow each day for the
past six months, from June to No
vember inclusive, show that the flow
has averaged per month well over
30.000,000 gallon a day while on some
days It ran well up towards 60,000,000
gallons. For tbe entire system, in
eluding the Walahole. Walawa, Kt-
papa and Waikakalaua ditches, the
lowest monthly average during the six
months was 29,500,000 gallons and the
largest flow was 49,900,000 gallons. In
the Walahole ditch, the main artery.
the lowest flo pas 26.S0Q.0QO and
the highest 31.400.V09.
In speaking of the flow Rodiek said
that when the project was first under
taken tbe directors expected about
15.000.000 gallons a day. With this
statement and. the showing of the
charts it is evident that the Walahole
project is more than satisfactory and
capable of supplying all the water
needed. It was also pointed out that
the Oahu Sugar Company woujd not
increase its sugar cane area over w
per cent, whfeb it is. doing,' unless
there was sufficient water to handle
the increased acreage and unless that
That any persjn or firm may 'take
sand out of Kapiolani park providing
they return an equal amount of soil
but that the Honolulu Construction A
Drayln Company many times in place
of the roil has returned quarry stone
are the facts of the case which was
exposed by : Supervisor Hatch at the
last in33ting of the board of super
visors. . x:-:--s
Supervisor Ben Hollinger explained
the action of the Honolulu Construc
tion A Drayins Company by saying
that the rock was dumped in to pre
vent the soil from sinking down
through the sand and that the company
was not making any money out of the
exchange. The fact, however, that the
sand is selling for approximately $1.50
a cubic yard wiiile the quarry rock
brings CO cents, according to the fig
ures of the city purchasing agent, re
mains. : I
Most of the supervisors are greatly
worked, up over the action of the park
officials in permitting the sand to be
taken away. Judge Hatch said today
that he believed it is a violation of
the law. "Kapiolani park is held in
trust for the people," he said, "and no
one but the legislature has any power
to give permission to take away even
a stone. I am not objecting so much
to the fact that quarry rock is being
dumped into the park, which alone is
bad enough, but I believe that the
sand in the first place should not have
been carted away."
Supervisor Horner said that so
much sand has been taken away that
enormous holes are left which would
not have been the case if an equal
amount of soil had been returned.

Commissioner AValdron explains to
the Star-Bulletin that the board has
been given rulings by the judges

almost obligatory, to recommend : for

of coarse, to determine whether his
record in prison entitles him to con

The board also took tip with the

and it is following an -established pre

the parole of prisoners as soon as
they have served their minimum
time, counting time off for good con

PIER CONDITIONS
Says Engineers Will Present
Sworn Statements That
Nothing is Wrong
To thresh but completely the ques
tion of plans, specifications, and con
struction work on the new concrete
piers at-the foot of Fort street and
to air the matter to the satisfaction
of those interested. Charles R. Forbes,
chairman, has called a meetiaf-4he4
board tomorrow night in the Capitol
at 7:30 o'clock. - -
This is Forbes' answer to the ac
cusations made yesterday afternoon in
meeting by Ed Lord, president of the
Lord-Young Engineering Company,
contractors, that the plans he had
drawn were faulty a thing which
caused a near-fight at the meeting.
Today engineers of the. public
works department worked throughout
the forenoon on the new piers, taking
measurements and running lines.
Forbes said following their inspection
that they will submit their state
ments regarding the piers, sworn to
before a notary. ...
"If the commission wants an inves
tigation from outside engineers," said
the chairman today, "I am ready for
it, but it Is a useless expense, for these
men will give the exact data in the
matter. V .
v "I was sore yesterday when Lord
made his accusation," admitted
Forbes. "The whole thing is the re
sult of the trouble they had with our
inspector. If that had not come up
there nothing would have happened
yesterday. There is nothing wrong
with the piers." . '
It is understood that engineers to
day found Pier 9 out of line by one
fourth of an Inch this because . the
forms ' gave slightly , in pouring the
cement and not because of any set
tling. Lord alleged that they were
out by from two to five inches yester
day and would some day go out to
sea, I.
The He was freely passed between
the two men. yesterday when the sub
ject came up at the meeting, Lord hav
ing declared that the plans should be
changed to save a big future loss to
the territory. ; Commissioner Mc
Carthy today stood staunchly by the
sugggestlon that he made yesterday
for an investigation by outside people.
He said he believes this the right at
titude and fair to both parties.

WASHINOTOX, I). C., Dee. L'l. Presi.lent WiUon's move fast
niglit in calling upon the warrinj? nations to out lint, for each aide,
the possible terms of peace, was a move to avert possible war with
the Unitetl States involvetl. y 'y;'-; .'' ..
This statement was authorized tolay by Secretary of State
Lansing. :. y. . ' ' -
t was made plain, on behalf of the administration, that the
danger of the United 'States being drawn into the war, and the
increasingly critical position of this country as u neutral, constituted
one of the moving considerations for the president's notes.
Secretary Lansing, in his statement, declares that the material
rights of the United States have not been the paramount con
sideration. :yy . ; V V-';-V-
He says that America's rights were being more and more in
volved; that the United States was ' drawing nearer to the verge
of war," and that the country and the government are entitled to
know exactly what each belligerent seeks ' in order that we may
regulate our conduct in the future."
Mi. Lansing's statement continues that the president's move
-.'indicates the possibility . of 'our being forced .into the war:" ' That
possibility, he pointed out, ought to serve as a restraining and
sobering force in safeguarding American rights. It may also served
he emphasized, as a force for the earlier conclusion of the war.
"Neither the president nor myself regards .the note as a peace
note," he said significantly, f a It is merely an effort to get the
belligerents to define the end for which they are fighting.'' . . .
"All "Washington, every circle of diplomacy, legislation, busmess

FOREIGN CONSULS
HERE RETICENT
Of the statements given to the Star
Bulletin today regarding opinions on
President Wilson's . proposal to . war
ring nations that they outline terms
of peace, one of the most expressive
came from Dr. Charles F. Dole, the
famous pacifist now visiting here,
who is well pleased at the president's
actions. Several consuls here of the
various countries affected were gen
erally silent although most of them
admitted everyone wanted peace.
In the face of an interview 'given
the Star-Bulletin yesterday by Dr.
Dole In which he regretted the fact
that the United States and other neu
trals had not pushed Germany's peace
proposals, the doctor was especially
f Jubilant over the new turn in Inter
national affairs and laughed when he
was told the president had made quick
response to his suggestions yesterday
in the Star-Bulletin.
"I den't know how much good the
president's action will work," Dr. uole
said, ' tut certainly it will do no harm
and I can not helo hoDins that it is

MAINTENANCE BE GIVEN
(Associated Prsi by Federal WlrItts) j
SAN FRANCISCO. Cal., Dec 21.
John F. Haley, U. S. collector of Inter
nal revenue of Hawaii, was today
sued for a separate maintenance by
his wife, Mrs. Minnie Haley, who is
staying with friends in Oakland. She
asks for a separate maintenance of
$175 a month. She charges extreme
cruelty and says that for two years
the collector has shown his prefer
ence for Hawaiian women. She says
that, in April he urged her to return
to the states and that bis remittances
have been irregular. She say s, how
ever, that she does not desire a
divorce.
said: "As the consul-general of Ja
pan in this country I am sorry to say
that I am not In a position to express
all of my opinions upon such ques
tions as you ask, but I believe that
Pres! dent Wilson is a lover of worlU
peace and the one person In the world
able to be the proponent of peace to
the warring countries In Europe to
day. ' I admire his sincere" enaeavors
for the peace of the world and human
ity, but it Is doubtful If the request
of the president to the warring coun
tries In Europe be accepted at the pre
sent stage of war. I hardly think that
his proposals will be seriously consid
ered by them.
"As to the terms of peace proposed .
by Germany, I will not comment upon
them at present, except to say I think
that Premier Lloyd George's reply Is
correct." .
