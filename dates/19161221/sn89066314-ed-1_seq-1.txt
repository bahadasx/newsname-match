Bin NOTE
Invasion of Rights Makes Sit
uation of Neutral Power
Intolerable, Wilson Says, in
Demand for Showdown.
NATIONS ON BOTH
SIDES TO BLAME
German Peace Proposal and
Lloyd-George's Speech Do
Not Influence Decision,
Secretary Declares.
By United l'ress
WASHINGTON. Dec. 21. Plainly
hinting that there is danger of the
United States being drawn into war,
Secretary of State Lansing this after
noon said this was the real reason be
hind the message of President Wilson
to the belligerents. In this message
President 'Wilson asked each country
to state Its reasons for urging and
carrying on the war. ' '.
"The situation of the United States
as a neutral is rapidly becoming in
tolerable," Secretary Lansing said.
"Therefore. President Wilson has de
manded a showdown. Wilson's, note
was dispatched to the warring powers
last night.
Lansing said that foreign matters
could not continue to go on much
longer as they have and that the na
tion "has been drawn near to the
verge of war." The Secretary of State
authorized the following statement as
to the real purposes behind the note
Says U. S. Rights Are InTaded.
"The rights of the United States
have been Invaded, and the situation
has become so intolerable that It can
not continue long. More and more.
the rights of this nation are being in
vndod hv'tiellieerentson both sides,
so that the situation Is becoming more
and more critical. We are near the
crge of war and must know how each
belligerent stands in order to regu
late our conduct in the future.
"It was not our material interests
that were considered when we said
that the situation might become in
tolerable. We have prospered by the
war. but our rights have been in
vaded." Lansing emphasized positively that
the German peace proposal and Lloyd
Georges speech had nothing to do
with the dispatching of Wilson's note.
On this point he authorized the fol
lowing quotation:
'Peace OTertures So Factor."
'No nation has been sounded on this
matter, and we did not know in ad
vance what Lloyd-George would say.
There was no consideration of the
German overtures or the speech of the
British premier in connection with
the formation of this note. The only
thing the German overtures did was
to delay the note a few days.
"It was not fully decided to send
the note until last Monday, The dif
ficulty that faced the President was
that the note might be construed as a
movement for peace and as an aid to
the German peace proposal."
The Secretary specifically denied
that that was a factor In the com
munication itself.
o Change In Xentralltr.
By United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. The Unit
ed States is not considering any
change in its policy of neutrality to
ward the belligerent nations, Secre
tary of State Lansing declared today
in a formal statement which is ex
plained, supplementing one he made
earlier in the day. He said he made
the new statement because his first
statement appeared subject to various
interpretations he did not mean to Im
ply. Regarding the note to the bel
ligerents, the Secretary of State said:
"It might be necessary to send a sup
plementary or explanatory note to the
belligerents if It is found that Its mis
construction Is general."
The official copy of Lansing's sec
ond statement said:
,"l have learned from several quar
ters that a wrong Impression- was
made by the statement I made earl
ier and I wish to correct that impres
sion." "I am going to suggest every
direct and necessary interest which
this country has in the possible peace
terms which the belligerents hate in
mind and I did not intend to inUmate
that the government was considering
any change in its policy of neutrality,
which it has consistently pursued in

still stand?" "Why certainly." he re
plied, "the second note would be un
intelligible without the first."

SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS IS
COMMERCIALIZED HART
"We are keeping Christmas Day
alive focthe sake of gala; wo are cap-,
italizing religion for the sake of com
merce," said Rev. Madison A. Hart in
his address at the luncheon of the
Commercial Club today.
"The Grand Canon," continued the
speaker, "is probably the greatest
natural wonder in the world. The
great wound in mother earth is made
by the Colorado river as it flows
through the limestone at a speed of
25 miles an hour to its termlnue. It
would take a downpour of water like
that which lifted the ark to raise this
river out of Its channel. The average
business man is wearing for himself a
channel which it will be very difficult
for him to get out of."
There are men, continued the speak
er, who have their attention focused
day after day on their business, who
know Sunday from no other day of the.
week, and whose lives are an endless
routine of work.
"If there isn't something to lift us
out of this deep channel," declared'
Mr. Hart, "then we are in a pitiable
condition. Such men must have some
lifting power from above or a tremen
dous explosive within. The spirit of
Christmas is such an explosive.
"We think of Christmas too largely
in terms of what we do for others. I
wonder if it does not do far more for
us than for those whom we help. I
wonder if the spirit is not too much
that of charity. We are likely to"
commercialize the Christmas giving
too much to realize ourselves the spir
it which makes life worth living for
all of us.
"There is another element that we
are in danger of overlooking. The
matter of justice should be stressed
more. If there were more of justice
in the world, there would be less need
of charity.

BOWXTOWX ROBBER STEALS HAT
Miss E. L. Shepard Had Left Bundle
in Store Boor ay.
A grey velvet turban hat valued at
$7.50 was taken from the doorway of
Miss E. L. Shepard's Millinery store,
18 South Ninth street, at 3:15 o'clock
this morning.
Miss Shepard had a number of
bundles in her hands and had to lay
the hat down to open the door. She
caried her bundles to the rear of the
store and was there but a few minutes
when she remembered she had left the
bat in the doorway. It was gone when
she went back to the door. Miss Hut
sell, her assistant, came in immediate

recently, between 30 and 40 religious
bodies met together, with seventeen
and a fdurth mlllioiTprotestant peo
ple being represented. A committee
was named on International Peace and
Arbitration. It was felt that this name
was not inclusive enough, that it did
not represent what the committee
stood for. The name was suggested
the 'committee on good will and jus
tice,' but to this name also objections
were raised. Finally the committee
was named by unanimous agreement,
the 'committee on international jus
tice and good will.'
"It is easier to be charitable than
to be just to dole out the crumbs
which fall from our tables than to be
square and fair with our fellow be
ings. t, The high cost of living comes part
ly because of your spending and my
jjjjp spending. The corners on food
stuffs, too, mean that we are not big
enough as a people to demand Justice
between one another and the public.
"We must win the battles of justice
in this cpuntry; we,must look tothe
day when there can be no corners.
And, please God, the day is coming
when it will be held just as criminal
to get a corner on food stuffs as to
take a stilletto and go out and take
someone's life.
"It is a false philosophy of art for
art's sake, music for music's sake, or
business for busjness's sake. We are
all here for man's sake and for God's
sake. The Christmas spirit is one of
the grandest virtues of mankind. The
Wise Men did more for themselves
than they did fop tie Babe; they lifted
themselves by their loving kindness;
and their serving.
"The Christmas spirit is the spirit
of Almighty God speaking to you and
me, to lift us out. of the sordldness ar I
drudgery, into the larger life of love,
service and understanding of our fel
low men."

police station, shortly after the rob
bery of the Alpha Delta Pi house had
been reported.
The negro's shoes were removed
and taken to the scene of the robbery
where a fresh shoe print was in the
snow.
It didn't fit. The negro was re
leased. The thief robbed the Alpha
Delta Pi house last night between 6
and 7 o'clock by the same scheme he
used three weeks ago. While dinner
was being served and the young wom
en were not in their rooms he raised
a window on the second floor went
through the rooms which had been
