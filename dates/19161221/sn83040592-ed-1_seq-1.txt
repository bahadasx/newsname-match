Mr. Smith of the Joplin News
Herald Writes Encouraging
ly of Baxter Springs.
Forty-five years ago Baxter
Springs, Kans., was a thriring
little town of 7,500 population.
It was the gateway to the north
ern and eastern markets for a
vast territory, inclnding parts of
Oklahoma, Texas, Southern
Kansas, Arkansas and South
western Missouri, because it was
the southern terminal of the
Missouri River, Fort Scott &
Gulf railroad, the first steam line
to enter that section of the coun
try. The town's upkeep depend
ed on the cattle industry. This
industry faded and (he town
dwindled.
Picture Baxter Springs as a
thriring town of 10,000 in 1920,
four years hence. At its present
rate of growth it will boast that
population, for it now has a real
basic industry, a lasting one, yet
in the bud but ready to bloom
out. That industry is sine and
lead mining.
Its Citizbns Awakening.
Baxter Springs people are just
beginning to awaken to the fact
that their little town is in such
close proximity to the big zinc
fields of the Miami district, of
the Galena camp and the Joplin
field. For the last thirty-fire
years it has been nothing but a
farming section. Two years ago
the Miami district began to ex
pand to the north and northwest.
Years ago strikes were" made !
near the Oklahoma-Kansas state
line. It was not until then that
persons owning tracts of land in
and around Baxter awakened to
the realization to the fact that
their land was situated in a very
opportune location.
Even then more or less doubt
prevailed and outsiders had to
come in and open up the fields
that are right at the very doors
of the town. In the last five or
six months many drill holes have
been put down to the south,
southwest and west of Baxter
and vast deposits of zinc have
been revealed. It was then that
Baxter took on a new life, a
semblance of its early days when
the cattle industry was a big
factor.
That .Baxter has a future be
fore it cannot be denied. By
next spring it will be the center
of a new rich mining camp that
is being developed rapidly. At
the present time about 100 drills
are operating full blast on the
Kansas side and new strikes are
being reported daily. New shafts
have been started, but it will re
quire some little time to get them
under way.
Population Up 50 Pxt Cent
With the finding of zinc ore
on three aides of -Baxter, a big
change has come over the little
town. Within the last six months
it has gainad 50 percent in popu
lation. Whereas the latest, cen
sus placed Baxter Springs at
1,800, business men declare that
it now is 2,800 and growing very
rapidly.
The general volume of all
business in the town has jumped
100 per cent over a year ago.
The valuation vof real. estate in
the town proper has advanced
100 per cent, while that la the
residence section has increased
40 and 50 per cent More real
estate deals have been consum
mated within the last siJweeks
than within twenty-five years
prior to the recent boom.
For instance, one corner' lot
that was purchased for $1,800 six
raostes io last ttk asU 1st
.' AUen-Willard Nuptials.'
Baxter people tere pleasantly
g trprised recently when the news
haked out thai Mrs. Lee Allen
and Mr. Leon L. Willard were
married on Sunday, December. 10,
at Joplin. The ceremony was
performed by Ret. J. L. Coral
Mr. and Mrs. Willard are both
numbered among Baxter most
likeable people and the announce
ment, though it was tardy, .was
followed by a shower, ot con
gratulations and best wishes for
the happiness and success of the
couple. They will reside in the
Allen home.
This being popular surely
has its drawbacks, particularly
to the newly weds in Baxter. Mr.
and Mrs. Leon Willard and Mr.
and Mrs. E- K. Brown learned
that fact fully Monday . night
when they were chariv aried by a
crowd of more than a hundred
of their young fx lends. The
mob routed out the first named
couple first, brought them ont of
their home and made the bride
groom give his bride a ride In a
wheel barrow up and down the
main strest while fire arms, sky
rockets and other implements of
torture kept up a bombardment
that sounded like life in the Ver
don trenches. Having finished
their score with Willard the
gang marched over to the Brown
home, found the occupants re
tired, but hanled. them out and
put them through the same or
deal Both victims came across
to the entire satisfaction of the
gang and the charivari was pro
nounced the biggest kind of a
success.
Declared Insane
John Schmid, the eccentric
shoemaker wtaf has resided in
Baxter for the past three or four
years, was taken in last Friday
by Marshal Horton on account
jf his peculiar actions. Judge
Ellis was summoned and on ex
amination Schmid was pronounc
ed insane and was taken to
Columbus where he is held at
present awaiting the decision as
to what to do with the man.
Schmid was a typical miser. He
lived on a few cents a week in a
filthy hovel not fit for a hog.
He had a hobby that he was
saving his money to evangelize
the world and spent much of his
time distributing tracts written
by . himself. He was bitter
against the Roman Catholic
church. He came to America
from Germany 45 years ago and
is not known to have any rela
tives in this country. He is
known to be worth considerable
money, having $3349 in bank
deposits and mortgages already
discovered. He will likely be
sent to a private sanitarium for
treatment.
Leonard Smith, son of Post
master and Mrs. C. L. Smith, is
home from the Military school at
Mexico, Mo., to spend his Christ
mas with the family. Leonard
is in fine physique, straight as
an arrow, and set off with his
military togs sure makes a fine
looking chap. He likes ' the
school life and is going to take
another year.
Ye editor and his family have
finally got into their new home
pn East Sherman street, where
they feel secure from the incon
venience of having to move again
until they get good and ready.
Living in a rented house in
Baxter these days is an uncertain
matter it is liable to be sold out
front under you any time. Moral:
Buy a lot and build a house for
yourself.
For the.Sesf of meats, sanitary
handling and prompt service, go
to J. F. Hartley & Son's Market.

PROSPECTKIG
Work Progressing Fast as the
Weather Permits and Good
Strikes . Reported.
Little has been said of late
about the prospecting operations
under way west and north of this
city. The activity has not abated
in the least: however- and the
only rxaaon. there is not more
being done is that the demand
for drill rigs has exhausted the
supply. Reliable news of the
findings, however, is hard to get
foe the reason that lease holders
are loath to give out information
before they have secured all the
leases possible and none are ever
ready to quit leasing. The News
hss reasonably reliable informa
tion that another very good strike
was recently reported from the
Newalr land cornering on the
Ebenstein property just a short
distance northwest of town. The
drill is now 'in 30 feet of very
good ore. The lease is held bv
Grantham & Pratt A promising
zinc strata has just been en
countered on the Eli Kane farm
in that vicinity and on Will
Swalley's place indications are
that the drillers aregoing to get
into good stuff soon.
Grocery Firm Dissolves
The grocery firm of Faught &
McDonald vu dissolved this
week, Mr. McDonald retiring.
He sold his interest to Thos. N.
Faught who will conduct .the
business from now on under the
style of Thos. N. Faught, the
grocer. Mr. Faught has secured
as his assistant Mr. A. F. Babb,
of Fairland, where before coming
here he was in the employ of Mr.
Faught in the grocery business
for several years. Mr. McDonald
does not expect to leave Baxter,
The News is glad to aay, but
hopes to find a few acres of land
near town, suited to his tastes
and pocketbook, on which he
would establish a poultry raising
industry.
Higher Demurrage
The new ruling on demurrsge
charges recently put into effect
by the Inter State Commerce
Commission will cause shippers
and receivers of car lot merchan
dise to be more hasty in loading
and unloading. At least that is
the purpose of the commission in
increasing the rates. Henceforth
the customary two free days will
be given, but cars held longer
will cost the shipper or receiver
of freight as follows: First day,
$1.00; second day, $2.00; third
day, $3.00; fourth day, $5.00 and
for every day thereafter $5.00. H
