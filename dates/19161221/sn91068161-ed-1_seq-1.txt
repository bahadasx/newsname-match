WIDOWS RECEIVED
Pension vouchers for. the Confeder
ate veteransand widows of Confeder
ate veterans in Henderson county have
been received and are being distributed
bv C. M. Pace, clerk of court. The
; vouchers this year total of $5,024.
' There are no first or second class
pensioners in the county. Last yea
there was one first class Benjamin
West, but he passed to his reward dur
ing the year.
There are four third class pensioners
living and these received $48 each. In
the fourth class tlierc are 154 pension
ers, including 67 widows and these re
ceived $32 each.
' During the year the following fourth
Class ( pensioners have died: Willis
Floyd, R. B. Hipps, Allen E. Hill, C. M.
Justice, I. T. Laughter, K. D. McKar
son, R. A. Walker, Mrs. R.-M. Garren
Mrs.- Mary M. Hill, Mrs. Ttebecca Love
and Mrs. Mary Wilson . .
These small amounts are the instru
ments through, which many a heart is
made glad along about Cristmas and
vMle it is unfortunate that the state
cannot make the vouchers for a larger
amount it is peculiarly fitting that they
should be distributed at this time of
the year. The brave veterans who
fought for the lost cause, as welas the
widows of those who died during the
war or have passed away since, ara
rapidly declining in numbers and we
would like to see the annual checks
made much larger for those who re

Following action by th supreme
court Tuesday dismissing Represonta
tire Britt's appeal from the decision
of Judge J. Adams, wnb refused to
erant -a writ of alternatiTe mandamus
to compel the Buncombe county board
of canvassers to certify to file vote of
the county on j the face of re?TiTH.as

the certificate of election, to congress
from the Tenth district by the state
board dt elections. The certificate
was issued late in the day by Gorernor
Craig.
Simultaneously with the announce
ment of a decision of the Supreme
court, .Judge W. I. Bond dissolved a
temporary restraining order secured
recently by ewinsel. for Britt, enjoin
leg the state board f canvassers, the
secretary 0f state and XSovernor Crai
from certifying what., they designated
aB "aupplemental returns, and issuing
a certificate of election to Mr. Weaver.
While not definitely recognizing the
authority of Judge Bond to act in this
case, the state board had recessed un
til today, the last on which they couti
legally Issue a certificate of election,
in order that the Supreme court
might have an opportunity to pass on
the legal aspects of the affair.
With the temporary injunction dis
solved, and the appeal of Congressman
Britt from the decision by the Sonvf-ros
court, there was nothing left to hinder
the exercising of their legal duties by
the members of the state board of elec
tions and the returns were duly certi
fied to the secretary of state., who ' in
turn certified them to Governor Craig.
Governor Craig immediately issued the
certificate of election to Mr. Weaver.
The issuing of a certifio&te to Con-e-essman-Elect
Weaver by Governor
Crate todav brings one of the closesr
and hardest fought political latllea
ever known in the Tenth district to a
close, so far action in this state is

as standard bearer for the democratic
party in the Tenth district, the election
has been before four Superior court
judges an dthe Supreme court before
being finally settled within the state.
On the face of the returns as recejiv.
ed up to November 9 in Buncombe
county, -Congressman Britt was leading
in the Tenth district by thirteen vote.
The county board of canvsifisar ttqt
and canvasaed-the state returns, and
the vote for the county ticket, but
withheld action on the congressional
returns pending returns from three
missing precincts. When t&ese returns
were brought in, it was stated that
several unmarked ballots had been
counted for bolh candidates, and these
returns were enough in favOr of Mr.
Weaver to overcome the apparent
majority of Mr. Britt and give the elec

majority of nine votes.
