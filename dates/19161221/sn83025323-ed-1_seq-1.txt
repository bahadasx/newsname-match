('OMMITTEE.
During the past few months a cer
tain party in Malta has become very
busy getting parties from other
points to jump claims on which set
tlers have resided for six or seven
years. The people of Phillips county
have beewn very free from business of
this kind and it is to bad that a var-I
mint who would\ cause respectable
people trouble should be permitted
to live among us. There is no dang
er of those being jumped losing
their claims, but it in many cases
puts them to considerable trouble
and expense.
Business men use our Bank Ac
count Plan to protect and conserve
their income; to build the small sur
plus from each individual transac
tion into a lump sum which can be
used as a working force to earn
more money.
PEACE PROPOSALS RIEJE('TED).
The German peace proposals have
been rejected by all the entente allies
in strong terms. England has asked
what Germany's terms are, but vir

declares that Germany and her al

fore peace terms can be discussed.
"War will last forever if peace

At a meeting held last Monday

of eight and fourteen must attend
Q"hool throughout the entire term
that school is in sebsion. Also chil
rdreu I"etween fourteen and sixteen,
who have not completed the eighth

This law hae been disregarded by
many in the community. Several

SONG FOR MUNICIPAL TREE
We are printing this week the words of the song, "The Little Town of
T thlehem," which will be sung by all at the municipal Christmas tree
on Christmas day. Commit this to memory so that you will be able to
swell the chorus at that time:
Little Town of Bethlehenm.
0, little town of Bethlehem, how still we see the lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light;
The hopes and fears of all the years are set in thee tonight.
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above,
While mortals sleep the angles keep their watch of wand'ring love.
0, morning stars, together proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth.
How silently, how silently the wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming; but i n this world of sin.
Where wee souls will receive Him st ill, the dear Christ enters in.
0, holy child of Bethlehem. descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in---be born in us today.
We hear the Christmas angels the glad tidings tell,
Oh, come to us, abide with us our Lord Emanuel! Amen

who resides near Shelby, Mont. Mr.

in that body.' As it now is only the
coulnty seats which are generally the
largest towins in tl' counity are re
presented, or at least that is the case
in a lmajority of the count!iies. Cas
cade county, for insta.n.e, elects six
representatives to the legislature.
Every one of t hes, representatives
are residents of IGreat Falls. As a
consequelnce the greater area of the
county is without representation
whatsoever It is not fair to the
country comnmunities and the laws
should be righted.
The law as it now stands pro
vides one representative in the leg
islature for every 4,500 population.
According to that Cascade county is
shy ,about two representatives, as
the city of Great Falls claims a pop
ulation of over 25.000. But unless
the present la w is changed, one or
tw(o more representatives from this
county will not hell, the country
outside of the county seat, but will
only give that city the privilege of
taking care of two more office seek
ers. For the last elec'ti.on there were
in the neighborhood of 12.000 regis
toered voters in this county. Great
Falls alone had close to 7,000 of the
voters, so it can readily he seen why
