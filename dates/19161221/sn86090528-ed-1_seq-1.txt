PRESIDENT URGES PEACE IN
IN ORDER TO KEEP U. S.
Situation of United States as Neutral Becomes Intolerable and Administration Can
Brook No Further Indignities to American'Jlag; Entrance of This Country Into
Conflict Would Turn the Scale Definitely, Says Secretary Lansing
3y United PreB.
Washington, Doc. 21. In making
the first formal effort to get a state
ment of peace terms from the bellig
erents in Europe and to evolve from
tho war the means of preventing a sim
, ilar tragedy, President Wilson acted
with tho knowledge that other neutrals
would stand behind him, it was stated
today. He has the greatest confidence
that his efforts wjll succeed.
Officials in Washington today had
scarcely recovered from the startling
development of Wilson's sending a
peace note to all countries and they
awaited with anxiety the first response
from the belligerent nations to the
president's suggestion for peace defi
nitions. The president's action came like a
thunderstorm out of a Blear sky. He
had made it clear many times that he
would make no such move unless he
yraa assured ol Its definitely accom
plishing its purpose. His determina
tion to launch his pronouncement was
reached suddenly although he had con
templated such action.
The change in policy of the govern
ment of acting as a mere messenger
for the belligerents remained an euig-
ma today but it was assumed that the
president had received assurances
that such an "entering wedge" propos
al would not be received in an un
friendly manner by the belligerents
Bryan is Pleasi"!
By United Presa.
Miami, Florida, Dec. 21. "The pres
ident rendered a distinct service in
throwing tho great influence of this
country into the balance on the side
of peace," was the comment of Wil
liam J. Bryan on President Wilson's
note, to the belligerents.
By United Press.
Washington, Dec. 21. Plainly hint
ing that there is danger of the United
States being drawn into the European
war, Secreary Lansing today stated
that this was the real reason behind
the president's message to the bellig
erents, sent yesterday.
"The situation of the United States
as a neutral is rapidly becoming in
tolerable," the secretary said, '-'and
therefore the president has demanded
a show-down. Our rights have been
invaded and the situation is becoming
so intolerable that it cannot go on
long.
"More and more our rights are be
ing invaded by the belligerents on both
sides, so that the situation is becom
ing increasingly critical. I mean by
this that we are drawing nearer the
verge of war and therefore we are en
titled to know what each belligerent
seeks in order that we may regulate
our conduct in, the future.
"It was not material interests that
were considered when we said the sit
uation might become intolerable. We
havo prospered by the war but our
rights have been invaded."
Lansing emphasized positively that
the German peace proposal and the
speech of Lloyd-George bad nothing to
do with the dispatch of the Wilson
note except possibly to delay the send
ing of it. "It was not finally decided
till Monday to send this note," said he.
"The difficulty that faced the presi
dent was that the note might be con
strued as a movement for peace and
in aid of the German overtures. He
specifically denies in the note itself
that this was a factor in the commu
nication." It was suggested to Lansing that the
United States was in no position to
stop tho war unless the belligerents
nMIYMQRE

themselves desired to end it. In reply
to this suggestion he hinted that if the
United States were to enter the war
it would turn the scale definitely and
he emphasized that there was a feeling
of danger that this country would be
drawn into the struggle. Lansing's
whole talk emphasized the idea that
"We will have to do something" if
American rights are further invaded.
Ambassadors Get Notes.
By United Press.
Washington, Dec. 21. The British,
Italian, Japanese, German, Bulgarian,
Persian and Turkish ambassadurs call
ed on Secretary Lansing today, pre
sumably to receive the note that was
forwarded to the belligerent nations.

New York, Dec. 21. The cot-
ton market took another trip
downward today. The close
was $5 under the close yester-
day and represented a break of

REMEMBER THE BOYS ON THE
BORDER ON CHRISTMAS DAY
Help the boys on the border to have
a Merry Christmas. They will doubt

spell which has been upon them since
realizing that they were there for bor
der service and not for actual warfare.
The following letters have been re
ceived by the Daily Express from Cor
poral A. Noble Ladd, a Chickasha boy
of Co. M Oklahoma National Guard,
Rationed at San Benito, Tex., which
merits the consideration of public spir

"Will it be Christmas here on the
border just as it is everywhere else?
Many a mother's son will spend his
first Christmas away from home. It
w ill be a glad day or a sad day accord
ing to the folks at home.
"Every mother who has a boy on the
border; every sister of a guardsman,
and every sweetheart, too, should be
a member of a committee to see that
the boys on the "border" have a happy
Christmas.
"It isn't the value of the thing that

FOR SMALL
GRAIN SEED
County Agent Has Daily Inquiries for Seed
for Which Farmers Could Get
Cood Prices
Grady county farmers have an excel
lent opportunity to dispose of their
email grain seeds at a good price if
they will communicate at once ith
County Agent O. C. Cooper.
The county agent is daily receiving
inquiries by mail from outside of the
state, for kaffir. cane, niilo maize,
feterita and other small grain seed.
These insuiries come largely from A.
& M. colleges of the various states
which feel a shortage in such seeds.
If farmers will inform Mr. Cooper the
amount of seed which they have on
hand, the variety and prices he will
make an effuit to hulk the lots and sell
them to good advantage. Seed oats
are also in demand and he cannot lo
cate any white clover seed at all.
"The small grain seed question is an
important one," declared the county
agent today. He believes it wc-ld

ed kaffir to thresh it.

CHICKASHA'S
MAY BE EXHAUSTED BY
NIGHT LOCAL DEALERS SAY
Publication of Actual Condition in Daily
Express Yesterday Causes Big Run
on All Coal Yards
USE AS LITTLE COAL AS
POSSIBLE IS ADVICE
County Attorney Yenable Says City Has
Right to Seize Railroad Coal to Avert
Actual Suffering
. The coal famine was rendered more
acute this morning when, upon awak
ening after a night on which tho mer
cury descended to tho five degree
mark, the people ' of Chickasha en
countered a hhow storm and a
high north wind which sent them scur
rying to their coal bins to investigate
their supplies of fuel. An immediate
demand for coal on the part of scores
of housewives almost swamped local
dealers in tho morning but as the
weather i.9.(c,ated after a fall of be
tween two and three inches of snow
the situation became more hopeful.
Tho concensus of opinion of dealers,
however, was that a conservation of
coal supplies by all residents of Chick
asha would do much toward averting
an absolute famine in caso immediate
shipments of fuel are not forthcoming.
By using as little as possible Chicka
sha sh.'.-uM weather tho storm without
difficulty as many families have large
quantities of fuel on hand. Sales In
most cases today were restricted to a
ton or less.
Run on Coal Banks.
"When I said yesterday that I could
take care of our own customers under
normal conditions for seven or ten
days I did not mean that 1 could sup
ply the town for that long a period,"
declared V. N. Adamson, manager of
the Davidson-Caso Lumber Co., over
the phone at 9 o'clock this morning.
"That, however, seemed to bo the con
struction which the general public has
put upon tho statement which was
published in the Daily Express yester
day and we have been deluged with
orders this morning. Should tho do
mand continue at this rate throughout
tho day our supply of coal will be ex
haused by night."
Mr. Adamson stated that the people
of Chickasha were making a run on
the coal supplies of the city as they
-uld make a run on a bank and that
tnis might work to hardship on poorer
families later on, on those people who
perhaps cannot at this time afford to
replenish their scant supply and may
not find it here when they are ready
to buy.
"Our supply Is going down," he said,
"right down to nothing. And It is be
ing bought largely by people who have
no immediate need of coal. That is,
many are buying a ton and two ton
who have nearly that much in their
bins."
Mr. Adamson spoke of the obligation
of tho coal dealer to protect humanity
and with other dealers suggested the
advisability of cutting down all sales
to a minimum. In fact Biich sugges
tions were made to patrons this morn
ing. City Should Seize Coal.
. In a case of emergency such as is
likely to exist should the coal famine
continue and the necessities of the
public demand it, tha city council
should meet and pass an order seizing
coal on the tracks of th Rock Island
or any other road running into Chick
asha and reimburse the owner to tho
full value of the amount thus confis
cated," declared County Attorney Veu
ablo to a representative of the Daily
Express this morning after learning
the critical condition? which is therat
ened locally.
"Every city has a right to go into
tha coal business if it sees fit or in
'tny other way to interest itself in pub
lic utilities when public needs require,
such action. There Is seldom a day
that there are not at least five cars of

MEET IN CONFERENCE
Legislature Will Be Asked to Pass Ami
Premium Law, Oregon Peddler
and Other Laws
Okluhomu City, Dec. il.A call
signed by more than one hundred mer
chants and endorsed by U: Retail
Merchants association, tho Merchants
Alliance, the Hardware and Implement
dealers, the Pharmaceutical associa
tion and other state organizations of
merchants has been issued for a meet
ing at Oklahoma City, ut 10 a. m. De
cember 27.
The call contemplates a mass nicot
inic of all merchants interested in leg
islative matters to consider the meas
ures which will be asked by the mer
chants at the coming session and to
complete plans for effective opposition
to obnoxious measuresi which are be
ing agitated. While tho various state
organizations "v o-nriiz tn pro
mote the success of tho meeting, mer
chants' not affiliated with either or
ganization are cordially Invited to par
ticipate. The movement has ilie sup
port of the jobbers and manufacturers
of the state as well as tho retailers
and the merchants signing tho call
hope that it will not only result In an
effective campaign for necessary leg
islation but that a permanent organi
zation free from factionalism may bo
an outgrowth of the meeting.
Among the measures to bo consid
ered by tho conference will be the Or
egou Peddler law, the Washington.
Anti-Premium law, the Necessities bill,
an Itinerant Merchant law, modifica
tion of the Bulk Sales law and the
maximum hour and minimum wage
legislation. There Is pronounced op
position among the merchants to the
proposed attempt -to make an eight
hour law out of the nine hour law
passed by the lust session of the legis
lature, and to couple with it minimum
wago legislation. Tho merchants feel
that a fifty-four hour law would afford
ample protection to female employes
and would be better liked by women
who are employed than a flat nine
hour day while they assert that an
eight hour day would close many ave
nues of employment to women. The
proposed anti-premium law will un
doubtedly provoke spirited discussion
but those w ho are promoting the meet
ing feel confident that it will receive
practically unanimous) endorsement by
tho merchants of the statu.
The jobbers of Oklahoma City are
