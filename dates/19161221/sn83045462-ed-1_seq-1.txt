DEBATE ON BISIDICT
i MONEY GILL HALTS
Discontinued When Mr. Bor
land Offers an 8-Hour
Work Day Amendment.
MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL TOPIC
Debate on the District appropriation bill
was discontinued suddenly late this afternoon
when Representative Borland of
Missouri endeavored to throw in an
amendment providing that no salaries in
the District of Columbia government
should be paid unless an eight-hour
schedule was maintained at the Distric t
building. Immediately Representative
Mann of Illinois made a point of order
that there was not a quorum present.
After scurrying around the Capitol the
sergeant-at-arms and the pages could
produce only seventy-seven members, and
the roll call was demanded.
The Borland amendment was precisely
what he endeavored unsuccessfully last
year, and this year, to attach to the
legislative, executive and judicial bill.
Representative Mann, who has been
endeavoring to hasten matters on the
bill, said that if Representative Borland
wanted to delay passage of the bill by
stirring up another long debate on the
eight-hour question for clerks he, Mr.
Mann, would see to it that a full quorum
was present.
After a quorum had been obtained the
Borland amendment was voted down and
the House resumed discussion of the bill.
With the prospect of finishing the District
appropriation bill before adjournment
today, the Hou.v took up the measure
with a vim shortly before 1 o'clock
this afternoon, the first lively passage occurring
when Representative Bonnet of
New York stirred up the slumbering fire
In the municipal hospital question.
"There has been some criticism in the
press," said Representative Bennet, "as
to hospital facilities here. Can the gen- ,
tleman from North Carolina enlighten
me on that point?"
Representative I'age. of North. Carolina,
who has been the storm center of
the fight for and against the municipal ,
hospital and its proposed Upshur street
eite. replied:
"The hospital needs here are great,"
he said, "but a neighborhood strife prevents
th" building of one. The present
municipal hospital facilities at the old
workhou: are utterly inadequate. The
corridors are crowded with sick men
and the whole situation is disgraceful, i
Yet whenever any one in Congress endeavers
to relieve the situation the
citizens of any one neighborhood where
It is proposed to place the hospital
arise in protest.
"Let me say that the citizens of this
city are responsible -for the lack of
proper hospital facilities."
i xiru ic is huoui time rue people
of this city learned that they live in !
a city and they must take care of their ,
afek tn *a city/* said Representative ,
' * Bonnet. ,
Bays People Are Inhumane.
"*I will make it stronger yet," Representative
Page said. "I think the
people here are inhumane. And yet
they approach members of the House
in their endeavor to keep a municipal j
hospital away from some one particu- I
lar neighborhood.
"I would have favored bringing in a hill
with a municipal hospital item in it, but
I know for a fact that I am beaten before
I start and there is no use in trying
to get such an item through Congress
"
By the middle of the afternoon nearly
all of the bill had been read with no
changes made and no salary increases reduced
except that of the Commissioners,
which was done yesterday. The* question
of a horizontal raise for clerks probably
will be voted pn later today.
Assessments for Benefits.
A point of order killed the legislative
paragraph containing a provision
to extend the limits of the areas in
which condemnation juries may assess
property for benefits. Representative
Mann, who made the point, declared it is
not correct to bring in ruch provisions
on an appropriation bill, and that the
District committee should report such
legislation separately to the House. Rep4
resentative Page, while conceding the
point of order, said the paragraph was
intended to relieve a situation created
oy existing law, under which many j
minor streets and alleys could not be '
opened because there could not be found
within the legal assessment area
. enough benefits to pay for the opening.
Representative Kocht of Pennsylvania
also made points of order against the
provisions requiring street railway
companies to take down certain poles
on <Jeorgia avenue and on Water street.
They were taken from the bill without
.irgument. Several school items caused
discussion, and points of order against
minor items causeX^slight changes, but
nothing of generah importance was
changed. The building items, including
$300,000 for Kastern High School,
were approved.
Representative Carlin of Virginia endeavored
to increase the pay of the
engineers of the tire department, but
was unsuccessful. The pay of nearly
every one in the department except the
engineers is increased by the bill. A
point of order knocked out the pro
posed increases in the health department
fort!*, including a bacteriologist
at J2.500 a year instead of J7 a day, an
assistant bacteriologist and three inspectors.
Representative Mann also |
nosed out of the bill the section pro- j
viding that at least twelve inspectors
should be engaged in milk and pure |
food inspection.
AMERICAN CO-OPERATION
f IN CHINESE LOAN DESIRED
By the Associated Pr*-**.
PEKING, December 21.?The Russian,
Japanese, British and French legations
have indicated to the foreign office and
the American legation their desire for
American co-operation in the reorganization
loan of ?10,000,000.
The Chinese government is becoming
impatient at th< delay on the part of
the representatives of Great Britain,
France, Russia and Japan in concluding
the arrangements for the loan.
These representatives state that the
loan is being considered by the London
agents.

CONFIDENT SENATE =
WILL PASS'DRY'BILL
Senator Sheppard and Other
Friends of D. C. Prohibition
I
Measure Optimistic.
OPPOSITION IN THE HOUSE i
The passage of the District prohibition
bill by the Senate is regarded to- ?
day as absolutely assured by Senator i
Sheppard, Senator Jones and other j
friends of the measure. The fact that <
the Senate late yesterday granted ,
unanimous consent to vote finally on ]
that ftfieasure and all amendments on
January 1) was the basis for the opinion ,
expressed. ]
"The District prohibition bill will pass ]
by a majority of from live to ten votes, j
irrespective of whether it carries the ]
Underwood referendum amendment or ,
not,'' Senator Sheppard said. Senator ]
Jones thought the majority for the bill ,
might be even larger. J
May Defeat Amendment. \
Senator Sheppard said that he be- i
lieved the opponents of the referendum t
amendment would be able to defeat it t
when it comes to a vote in the Senate
again. The amendment was defeated c
in committee of the whole on Tnesdav ^
oy a vote of 38 to 38. It is known, |
however, that several of the senators j
who voted for the referendum may c
change their votes on the next roll 1
call and oppose it. Many of the senators
who voted for the referendum
will support the Sheppard bill with or
without the referendum, thereby in- r
suring the passage of the measure.
v
House Committee Hostile. : *
After the bill has been passed by the 1
Senate it will go to the House for consid- ''
eration. and will be eferred to the ^
House District committee. It has been n
reported that the House committee is t
hostile to the measure, and that every f
effort will be made to pigeonhole it. On r
the other hand, the supporters of prohi- f
bitlon will exert all their influence to n
get the bill reported to the House and v
have it passed. a
Filibuster Prevents Vote. /
The agreement to vote on the Shep- p
paid prohibition bill and all amend- s
merits mat mignt oe penamg, January v
9, was reached late yesterday after- *
noon. An active filibuster to prevent s
a vote before the Christmas recess had v
been under way for several hours, and *
the friends of the measure, led by
Senator Sheppard, conferred with its ii
apponenta and finally reached an c
igreement -for A vote January 5. This 1
late, however, was not acceptable to o
some of the senators who expected to J1
be out of the city, and January 9 was J
finally fixed for the vote. Under the *
unanimous consent agreement entered n
into, at 1 o'clock January 9 the Senate ?
will proceed to the consideration of the *
Sheppard bill, and after 2 o'clock no 1
senator shall speak more than five min- j J1
utes nor more than once on the bill, Sand
not more than three minutes on *
any amendment thereto. The final vote *
is to be taken on the calendar day of 1
January 9. .
The senators opposed to the Sheppard (
prohibition bill who are supporting an
amendment for a referendum of the
matter to the people of the District,
confident that they had enough votes
to put the proposed amendment through
if all their votes were present or acr?o'.inted
for. and knowing that thev
could not muster their full strength I j.
yesterday, early determined to prevent I
a vote on the bill before the holidays, j '
A tactical error on the part of one of'c
the supporters of the bill. Senator | 0
Ashurst, when he obtained unanimous
consent for consideration of a bill dealing
with the Choctaw Indians, aided r
the filibusters. Senator Ashhurst, as c
soon as he saty the purpose of the op- r
ponents of the Sheppard bill, attempted
to withdraw his measure, and Senator '
Sheppard moved to take up the 01s- i
trict prohibition bill. c
Prohibition Antis Act Quickly. c
The opponents of the prohibition bill J
were quick to take advantage of the ;
opportunity to contend that it had been
displaced before the Senate, and were i
supported by a ruling from the chair, i
Senator Ashurst then sought to with- '
draw*the bill, and did so physically by j
stepping to the desk and putting the ]
document in his pocket. Senator Heed <
of Missouri insisted that such a method ^
of withdrawing bills was not in par- j
liamentary procedure.
"If men are permitted to dispose of i
legislation by physically applying .
strong-arm methods and grabbing bills ,
out of the possession of the Senate," j
said Senator Reed, "legislative business ,
then will resolve itself to grabbing and
running. Under those circumstances ,
the man who can grab the most and ,
run the fastest would be the greatest ;
statesman. If we are proceeding under ,
Marquis of Queensbery rules, it is time |
we knew it. We may even descend to
packing-house rules, which, I under- '
stand, permit using the thumbs and j
even the feline method of scratching j
with the finger nails." '
Senator Ashurst Seniles.
Senator Ashurst declared he was not :
disturbed by Mr. Reed s attack.
"The senator from Missouri," he said,
"is incapable of carrying out here or
elsewhere any threat he makes against
j me or against any one else. He is fond
' of a joke against any one else, but
when it is on himself ho dances around
'like a rat on a griddle trying to get
off." He declared that if Senator Heed
were fair about the prohibition bill he
would allow it to come to a vote. <
"The saloon lost out in Arizona and
' elsewhere," he continued, "by such tactics
as these. It committed suicide
: when It spewed the slime of politics
; like this on itself. It ill becomes the
j senator from Missouri to rely on tcch!
nical ideas and motions against this
' bill, and It ill becomes him to insinuate
: I have purloined this bill."
| As he finished the Arizona senatof
: walked slowly through the aisle, wav?
| ing the bill over his head and restored
; it to the clerk's desk,
i "The Indians of Oklahoma may sufi
fer, but whisky will still reign in the
National Capital," said he.

TAMMANY "BRAVES"
ARETOBE IN LINE
Chief Murphy to Head His Followers
in the Inaugural
;
Parade.
REAL INDIANS TO MARCH
The "braves" of Tammany Hall, the
eldest political organization in the
united States, 2,000 strong, under the
personal leadership of their chief,
rharles F. Murphy, attended by a large
ielegation of real Indians, are to be a
feature of the inaugural parade.
This was made certain at a conference
yesterday between Representative
Daniel J. Riordan of New York and
Robert X. Harper, chairman of the
inaugural committee. Representative
Riordan, who is making the arrangenents
for Tammany Hall, assured Mr.
larper that this veteran political organization
will take even more promilent
place in the parade than at the
Irst induction into office of President
iVilson, and asked that arrangements i
>e made for the Indians to march with
hem, which was a striking feature of
he big parade in 1913.
Chairman Harper had already received
letters assuring him that the
ndian chiefs are ready to participate
n the parade, and asking that translocation
be arranged, so that he was
?repared to give Representative Ri?rdan
every assurance that this picuresque
feature would be provided.
Women May Be in Parade.
Another precedent in inaugural pa ades
is to be broken by allowing
c>rnen to participate in as large num ers
as they desire. This was admited
by Chairman Harper today when
luestioned regarding such arrange- I
nents. Mrs. James H. Boggs and Mrs. {
Vesley Martin Stoner. who have been j
lamed on the inaugural committee, are
o be allowed the privilege of arranging
or the participation of women.
"We did not bar them from the proession
to the ballot boxes," said Mr.
Tarper. "so it is perfectly proper, in
ay opinion, to admit them to parade
t'ith us in celebration of the election
nd the induction into office of a Preeient
they helped to return to the White ;
louse."
The voting women of the west are ]
lartlcularly anxious to make a demon- ,
tration on inauguration day, and the
rediction was made in suffrage circles
oday that women by the thousands
fill be seen in the inaugural procesion.
It is probable that Mrs. Boggs
fill organize a committee of women to
ake charge of this feature of the in- .
ugural celebration. ]
Through a clerical error in transcrib- i
ng the names of the general inaugural
ommittee. published in me 01 ar ;co- .
erday, the names of the three justices
f the Court of Appeals and the five
list ices of the District Supreme Court
rere omitted. Mr. Harper &nnoun<fcd$

line judges in the general Inaugural
ommittee: Court of Appeals, Chief Jusice

While President Wilson does not
actually propose peace or offer media

that "an early occasion be sought to

war might be concluded and the arrangements
which would be deemed
satisfactory as a guaranty against its
renewal or the kindling of any similar
conflict in the future, as would make
it possible frankly to compare them."
Instruction to Ambassadors.
The notes to the belligerents are prefaced
with this instruction by Secretary
Lansing to the American ambassadors
presenting them:
"The President directs me to send
you the following communication, to
be presented immediately to the minister
of foreign affairs of the govern.
. V
ment to wnicn you uic ?
The texts * of the notes themselves
then begin identically, as follows:
"The President of the United States
has Instructed me to Buggest to the
(here is inserted a designation of the
government addressed) a course of
action with regard to the presfent war
which he hopes that the government
will take under consideration as suggested
in the most friendly spirit and
as coming not only from a friend, but
also as coming from the representative
of a neutral nation whose interests
have been most seriously affected
by the war and whose concern for
its early conclusion arises out of a
manifest necessity to determine how
best to safeguard those iiHerests if
the war is to continue."
Variation in the Texts.
At this point the texts vary. In the
notes to the central powers this paragraph
follows next:
"The suggestion which I am instructed
to make the President has long had
it in mind to offer. He is somewhat
embarrassed to offer it at this particular
time, because it may now seem

In the note to the entente allies the
following- paragraph takes the place, i
01 the one just quoted:
"The suggestion which I am instructed
to make the President has long
had it in mind to offer. He is somewhat
embarrased to offer it at this

Proposals Are Identical.
Then, all the notes proceed identically 1
I as follows: '
j "The President suggests that an early 1

Mr. Lansing's Statement. i
Secretary Lansing's statement, upon ,
which the White House refused to
comment, was as follows:
"The reasons for the sending of the
note were as follows:
"It isn't our material interest we had
in mind when the note was sent, but
more and more our own rights are becoming
involved by the belligerents on
both sides, so that the situation is becoming
increasingly critical.
"I moan by that, that wo are drawing

Warring Nations Not Sounded.
"No nation has been sounded. No
consideration of the German overtures
or of the speech of Lloyd-George was
taken into account in the formulation
of the document. The only thing the
overtures did was to delay It a few
days. It was not decided to send it j
until Monday. Of course, the difficulties
that face the President were that
It might be construed as movement
toward peace and in aid of the German
overtures. He specifically denies that
that was the fact in the document
itself."
"The sending of this note will indicate
the possibility of our being forced
into the war. That possibility ought
to serve as a restraining and sobering
force, safeguarding American rights,
[t may also serve to force an earlier conclusion
of the war. Neither the ;
President nor myself regards this note

President Withholds Comment.
At the White House no effort was
nade to lessen the importance of Secretary
Lansing's statement. President
Wilson would make no comment.
The President's notes had been prac:ically
forty-eight hours on their way
oday, and officials believed they had
eached all the foreign capitals. Although
all official Washington is
istening with the keenest expectations
o any indications of how the notes will
ae received, diplomats think it is incredible
that President Wilson should
lave taken his action without some
relief that it would not be flatly rejected
without consideration by the
entente allies. The wish and hope of

abandonment of the theory of "splendid
isolation" which Washington bequeathed
to the country. Significance
is attached to the fact that the President
uses the word "insure" rather than
"enforce" as indicating: that he has not
committed himself to any one program
to accomplish that end, but that
he is open to whatever suggestions
may seem best to the other world nations.
First Official Proposal.
Repeated efforts have been made to
enlist the American government in
some sort of international agreement
involving responsibility, but always the
answer has been that the United States
would stand alone. Several months ago
President Wilson spoke most earnestly
before the League to Enforce Peace ot
his hope that the United States would
join in some new international arrangements,
but not until now is he
known to have made the proposal officially
to the nations of the world.
It is thought here that along these
lines President Wilson's note will And
its most ready reception abroad, for all
parties have indicated their belief that
the war will have been in vain unless
from it come guarantees against its
repetition. Former Foreign Minister
Sir Edward Gray, for England; Premier
Briand, for France, and Chancellor
Bethman Hollweg. for Germany, have
all committed their nations to some
sort of international reorganization to
secure the ends laid down in the President's
note, and the official offers of the
central powers, together with LloydGeorge's
speech in reply, have accentuated
that purpose. As yet, however,
the actual procedure which may be
adopted appears uncertain. Germany
apparently has given up her earlier opposition
to disarmament, which nearly
split the second Hague conference. No
official statement has come from either
England or France on this subject in
the present circumstances. It was England,
however, at The Hague conference,
second by France and the United
States, that insisted on stating its view
in iavor or disarmament.
Await Replies to Notes.
Deepest interest centered today In
the probable time and form of the beligerents'
reply. It is assumed that the
members of each group of allies will
;onsult one another and agree on a uniform
statement of views, but whether
that statement will be joint, identic or
lifferent in each case is not knowrft The
solidarity which has been so strikingly
shown, both by the central powers*
dentic proposal and the allies' pracically
simultaneous response is expected
to be continued here. It is thought
ilso that some time may elapse before
:he different groups can settle down to
m actual agreement on terms to bo
presented, in case It is decided to heed
he President's request by going into
hem fully.
Meanwhile the allied entente's responses
to the central powers' proposals
ire expected almost any time for transnission
through this country to their
rarious destinations.
Relies on Public Opinion.
President Wilson is relying upon
rnblic opinion in other neutral nations
o add force to his efforts to clarify the
ituation. While the American governnent
acted entirely on its own responibility,
President Wilson feels other
leutral nations, for economic reasons,
.re vitally interested in the outcome.
It was stated authoritatively today
hat the President acted without any
.ssuranc.es that his move would be favorably
received by the entente allies,
le took the position, it was said, howver,
that his note calls for replies, and
hat, even though unfavorable, the reponseB
would tend to make clear the
bjects of the belligerents and estabIsh
some common ground.
There is every indication that Present
Wilson is hopeful of the outlook
.nd he believes the way has been
pened for negotiations. What steps
ie takes in the future depend entirely
ipon the nature of the responses from
he belligerents.
The President already has made clear
hat while the American government
as no interest In the terms on which
eace is made between the belligerents
hemselves. It has a very profound liA
erest in bringing about an agreement f
or maintaining peace in the future.
