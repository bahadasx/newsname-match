President's Peace Note Starts International Hubbub
Stand by the
President!
(Because he In the leading pacifist of Tacoma, The Times today asked Ilev. Frank
Dyer, pastor of the First ConineKatlonal church, lo give the people of this coiiimiiiiity
his interpretation <if President Wilson's peace note. We heartily endorse his sentiments
here expressed.—Fdttor.)
BY REV. FRANK DYER.
Mr. American Citizen: Your president, your country and hu
manity need you.
This is one of the greatest mornings in the history of
mankind.
The president in his message to the warring nations
claimed to speak for you; will you now speak with him—
or against him (
He said: "The people and the government of the
United States" are vitally concerned to secure the fu
ture peace of the world. Are we prepared to rise at once
to that description of ourselves?
pkkh. muKM For myself I know that this nation will have no oc
casion to regret for 10,000 years to come the message which went to
Europe yesterday from our president.
No greater message has ever gone from the leader of any people.
It marks the birthday of a new world order.
It has become clear that this war, in the providence of God, was
destined to end the day of isolated nationalities and to usher in the
new day of co-operative internationalism.
The president sees that-this is more likely to be secured if the war
is ended now than if it is continued indefinitely.
It is a master-stroke to get the eyes of belligerent and neutral
peoples alike looking for the new light that is to come into the affairs
of the world.
We can all help or hinder by the attitude we take. In view of the
cave-life from which the race has come, the most damnable heresy
today is to believe that human nature cannot change, that humanity
cannot move forward, that war caiwt be smitten unto death!
The Americ i citizen should be heard around the world today,
supporting the voice of our president—calling for the end of the war
—demanding a concert of all nations which shall sing peace on earth,
good will to all men.
Brother Man, let us get a bit of Christmas in our hearts; believ
ing in and inaugurating a new era for the human.race.

Your Yacolt stories are fine. They carry one back to

Please continue them' put ln more comment and im

little more of yourself ln them.
Sometimes just a line or two brings back vistas of one's

brought to mind, and if you promise not to publish it I will
send It to you.
