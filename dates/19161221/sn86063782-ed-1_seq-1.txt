NO PEACE YET SAYS
DAVID LLOYD GEORGE
Allies Will Not i'ut Head 111 Germany's
Noose, British Leader Asserts.
Intense Interest in London as to the
New Premier's Announcement of
Poliry.
Loudon, Dec. I'd.?Premier Lloyd
< leorge said iu the house of commons
today that it was felt that they should
know before entering negotiations that
Germany was prepared to acred to the
only terms whereon it was possible for
inravr IU it uuiuiuni iinu ujauuaiiii:\i m
Kuroiie. The Premier sniil that without
reparation i*?ace would be imitossihle.
Mr. Lloyd George .said there were 110
proj>osals for peace. To enter proposals
of which they had 110 knowledge was to
put their heads into a noose with the
roi>e end in the hands of Germany.
Much as they longed for it, the
premier added, the central powers'
note and the speech preceding it afforded
small encourgement and hope for
an honorable and lasting peace.
Mr. Lloyd George said: "Our
answer will be given in full accord
with our allies. Each of the allies has
separately and independently arrived
at the same conclusion. I am glad of
the first answer given by France and
Uussia.
Mr T.lnvil Owirco <nw1 tlu?
would Insist that the only end of the
war must be complete guarantee
against Prussian militarism disturbing
the i>eace of Europe.
The formal reply of the allies, the
premier announced, will be given in
the course of a few days.
The premier said. "We will await
until we hear what terms and guarantees
there are surer than those which
Germany broke. Meanwhile we put
our trust in our unbroken army."
After declaring that i>eace without
reparation was impossible, the premier
asked whether "all the outrages on
land and sea" had l>een liquidated by
a few pious prhases about humanity.
During the war, the premier said,
shipping would be nationalized in a
_ true,
Dealing with the war situation, the
premier said he had to paint a stem,
but not gloomy picture. The Roumanian
blunder was an unfortunate one.
but at the worst it only prolonged the
war, and could not affect it. It might
have a salutory effect, he continued, in
calling the attention of the allies to
obvious defects of organization. To
prevent the Roumanian situation from
becoming worse they had taken strong
action. In Greece they were taking
m> risks. They hail decided to recognize
the agents of former Premier
Venizlous.
The speech of Chancellor von Bethmanu-Hoilweg
before the German
reichstag was characterized hy Mr.
Lloyd George as constituting in substance
a denial of the only terms upon
which peace was i>ossible.
Premier Lloyd George said the liiue
ha?l come when the dominions should
be consulted more formally as to the
war. An imperial conference would
be summoned at an early day to discuss
vital questions.
The premier said it was proper to
appoint a director of natonal service
and that all industries and services
would be scheduled as essential or
non-essential to the war. _
Shaking of the western front Mr.
Lloyd George referred to the growth
of the British armies there and continued
:
"I an? convince' iltimate victory "
sure of the nation that shows rue same
spirit of endurance and readiness to
learn as the mud-stiued armies at the
front."
Turning to the more purely political
of the domestic problems before the
new minsstry, Mr. Lloyd George said:
"We are enxious to avoid all controversal
questious. The functions of
the premier and leader of the house of
the house of commons have been separated
because it was believed the double
tasks were toy much for one man. The
orgainzatiun of the new cabinet is best
adapted for the purpose of war. In
war you want prompt decision, and
the allies have suffered disaster after
disaster from tardiness of decision."
London, Dec. 10.?The lirst appearance
of David Lloyd George before the
houpe of commons as premier was
made today in circumstances seldom
if ever faced by a new holder of the
office.
Even if the peace proposals of the
central powers had not intervened his
statement of the i>olicy of his government.
which was chosen iu reply to a
public demand for more vigorous prosecution
of the war, would have marked
au imi?ortaut step in the world eon
ilicL
The peace note, however, vshifted
the interest and every corner of the
world awaited the announcement as
to the UrltLsh attitude .toward the
move of the conral powers.
The secerot was so well'kept that the
best informed parliamentary corrc
siKUuleiits differed iis to the treatment
