WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. Secretary Lanaing today
authorized the following statement:
"The reasons for the sending of the note were as
follows:
"IT ISN'T OrK M ATKKIAIi INTKUKST VK HAD
IN MINT) WHKN TIIK NOTM WAS SKNT ; I5UT MOKK
AND MOIIK OI R OWN HKIIITS AKK HKCOMINC
INVOLVKD I!V TIIK IJKI.MtJKKKNTS ON I'.OTII SIDICS.
SO THAT TIIK SITUATION IS INCOMING INCKKAS
IN(H,Y CKITICAI,.
"I mean by that that we are drawing nearer the verge
of war ourselves, and, therefore, we are entitled to know
exactly what each belligerent seeks, in order that we may
regulate our conduct in the future.
"No nation has been sounded. No consideration of
the German overtures, or of the speech of Lloyd George
was taken into account in the formation of the document.
The only thing the overtures did was to delay it a few
days. It was not decided to send it until Monday. Of
course, the difficulties that face the president were that
it might be construed as a movement toward peace and in
aid of the German overtures. He specifically denies that
that was the fact, in the document, itself."
Secretary Lansing further said:
"The sending of this note will indicate the possibility
of our being forced into the war. The policy ought to
serve as a restraining force safeguarding American rights.
It may also serve to force an early conclusion of the war.
Neither the president nor myself regard this note as a
peace note, it is merely an effort to get the belligerents
to define the end for which they are fighting."

Rights Involved More.
Secretary Lansing today authorized the statement that ma
terial rights of the United States had not been the paramount
consideration. America's rights, he said, were being more and
more involved by the belligerents, and as the United States
was "drawing nearer the verge of war," it was entitled to know
exactly what each belligerent seeks "in order that we may
regulate our conduct in the future."
