Blunders in Quotation.
Errors of quotation are common la
speech and writing.. Byron quoted
Shakespeare, "An eagle towering in his
pride of place." But what Shakespeare
wrote was, "A falcon towering in his
pride of place." Milton wrote not "as
thick as leaves in Vallombrosa," bin
"thick as autumnal leaves that straw
the brooks in Vallombrosa;" not "fresh
fields and pastures new," but "fresh
woods." Nathaniel Lee did not write.
''When Greek meets Greek then come»
the tug of war," but "When Greek
joins Greeks, then was the tug of war,"
a very different thing. Doubtless, how
ever, the modification of phrases by
popular usage is not wholly evil; it eor
taiuiy is inevitable. The saying, "Let
us eat, drill!; and be merry, for tomor
row we die." is of curious origin. The
preacher in Ecclesiastes says, "A man
hath no better thing under the earth
than to eat and to drink and be mer
ry;" Isaiah, "Let us eat and drink, for
tomorrow we shall die;" Luke, "Take
thine ease, eat, drink and be merry "

not so weif known. Several centuries
ago arose in England and France a
class of thrifty and foresighted trades
men who went about buying up bar

merchandise, just as the modern Arueri

'ou gros' and the Englishman came to

CHAPTER I.
The Road.
T HROUGH the San Fernando val
ley, toward the hills of Calaba
sas, runs that old road, El Ca
mino Real of the early mission
days.
And now replicas of old mission
bells, each suspended in solitary dig
nity from a rusted iron rod, mark in
tervals along the dusty way, once a
narrow trail worn by the patient feet
of that gentle and great padre, Junl
pero Serra, i trail from the San Ga
briel valley to the shores of Monterey.
A narrow trail then, but, even tlieu,
to him it was broad in its potential
significance of the dawn of grace upon
the mountain shores of heaven's lost
garden, California.
Not far from one iron posted bell In
the valley, El Camino Real falters, to
find eventually a lazy way round the
low foothills, as though reluctant to
lift its winding length over the sharp
pitch of the Canajo pass beyond.
Near this lone bell another road, an
offspring of old El Camino Real, runs
quickly from its gray and patient sire.
Branching south in hurried turns and
multiple windings, it climbs the roll
ing hills, ever dodging the rude piled
masses of rock, with scattered brush
between, but forever aspiring cour
ageously through the mountain sage
and sunshine toward its ultimate green
rest in the shadowy hills.
In the sweet sage is the drone of
bees, like the hum of a far city. The
thinning, acrid air is tinged with the
faint fragrance of sunburnt shrubs and
grasses.
With the sinuous avoidings of a baf
fled snake flic read turns and turns
upon itself until its earlier promise of
high adventuring seems doubtful. As
often as not it climbs a semibarren
dun stretch of sun baked earth dotted
with stubby cactuses, passes these
dwarfed grotesques and attempts the
narrowing crest of the canyon wall, to
swing abruptly back to the cactuses
again, gaining but little in its upward
trend.
Impatient, it finally plunges dizzily
round a sharp outstanding angle of
rock and down into the unexpected
enchantment of Moonstone canyon
Here the gaunt cliffs rise to great wild
gardens, draped with soft rose and
poignant red amid drowsy undertones
cf gray and green and gold. Dots of
vivid colors flame and fade and pass
to ledges of dank vineelad rock and
drifts of shale as the road climbs
again.
At (he next turn are the indistinct
voices of water commingling in a
monotone—and the road ceases to be
as the cool silver of a mountain st eam

sequential meandering«, but with the.

moving in easier * sweeps through a
widening valley, but forever climbing.
Again and again fetlock deep across
it runs the stream, gently persistent
and forever murmuring its happy so
liloquies.
Here and there the road passes
quickly through a blot of shade—a
group of wide spreading live oaks—and
reappears gray white and hot in the
j sun. Then, its high ambition fulfilled,
the road recovers from its last climb

Among the many piders to and from

For five years "the rat" had journey
ed back and forth between the desert
station on the Mojave and the range
to the north. The townspeople paid
scant attention to him. He was si in
ply another "desert rat" obsessed with
the idea tint gold \Os to be found in
those northern hills. He bought sup
plies and paid grudgingly No one
knew bis name.
The prospector was much younger
tbau be appeared to be. The desert
sun bad dried his sinews and warped
his shoulders. The desert wind had
scrawled thin lines of age upon his
face. The desert, sofitude had stooped
him with its awesome burden of
brooding silence.
Slowly his mind had been squeezed
dry of ail human interest save the re
current memory of a child's face—that,
and the poignant memory of the child's
mother. For ten years he had been
trying to forget The last five years
on the desert had diigmo 1 tlie woman's
visioned face as the 'child came more
often between him and the memory
of tha mother in his^Ireams.
Then there were voices, the voices of
strange spirits that wThged througlfr
the dusk of the outlands and hovered
round bis five at night.
One voice, soft, insistent, ravished
his imagination with visions of Illimit
able power and peace and rest. "Gold!

"Gold! Lost Gold!" It Would 'Whisper.
Lost gold!" it would whisper ns he sat
by the meager flame. Then lie would
tremble and draw nearer the warmth
"Where?" he would ask, tempting the
darkness as a child, fearfully certain
of a reply.
Then another voice, eadenced like
the soft rush of waves up the sand,
would murmur, "Somewhere away,
somewhere away, somewhere away!"
And iu the indefiniteness of that an
swer he found an inexplicable joy. The
vagueness of "somewhere away" was
as vast with pregnant possibilities as
his desert. His was the eternity of
hope, boundless and splendid in its ex
travagant promises. Drunk with the
wine of dreams, he knew himself to
be a monarch, a monarch uncrowned
and unattended, yet always with his
feet upon the wide threshold of his
kingdom.
Then would come the biting chill of
night, the manifold rays of stars and
silence, silence reft of winds, vet
alive with the tense immobility of the
crouching beast, waiting—waiting—
The desert, impassively withering him
to the shell of a man or wracking him
terribly in hont or in storm and cold,
still cajoled him day and night with
promises, whispered, vague and intox
icating as the perfume of a woman's
hair.
Finally the desert flung wide the se
cret portals of her treasure house.
The man. bis dream all but fulfilled,
found the taste of awakening bitter on
his lips, no counted his years of toil

hands, claw-like, scarred, crippled.
He felt the weight of his years and

self to lie a thing to he pointed at, yet
he longed for the sound of human
voices, for (he touch of human .hands,
for the living sweetness of his child's
face. The sirens of the invisible night
no longer whispered to him. He was
utterly alone. He had entered his
kingdom. Viewed from afar it had
seemed a vast pleasure dome of infi
nite enchantment. He found success,
as it ever shall be. a veritable desert,

from one aspiration to another, only
to consume his years in Just.

Ho again journeyed to the town be
side the railroad, bought supplies and
vanished, a ragged wraith, on the
horizon.
Back in the canyon he set about his
labors, finding a numbing solace in
toil.
But at night he would think of the
child's face. He had said to those
with whom lie had left the child that
he would return with a fortune. They
knew he went away to forget. They
did not expect him to return. That
had been ten years ago. He bad writ
ten twice. Then he had drifted, al
ways promising the inner voice that
urged him that he would find gold for
her. his child, that she might ever
think kindly of him So he tried to
buy himself with promises. Once he
had been a man of his hands, a man
who stood straight and faced the sun
Now the- people of the desert town
eyed him askance. He heard*them say
he was mad—that the desert had "got
him." They were wrong. The desert
and its secret were his—a sullen para
mour, but bis nevertheless. Had she
not given him of her very heart? .
He viewed liis shrunken body, knew
that be stooped and shuffled, realized
that he had paid the inevitable, the in
exorable' price for the secret. His wine
of dreams had evaporated. He sifted
the coarse gold between his fingers, let
ting it fall back into the pan. Was it
for this that he had wasted his soul?
In the desert town men began to
notice tile regularity of his comings
and goings. Two or three of them
foregathered in the saloon and com
meuted on it.
"Ho packed some dynamite last trip."
asserted one.
There was a silence. The round
clock behind the bar ticked loudly
ominously.
"Then lie's struck it or last," said
another.
"Mebby," commented the first speak
er.
The third man nodded. Then came
silence again and the absolute ticking
of the clock. Presently from outside
in the white heat, of the road came the
rush of hoofs and an abrupt stop. A
spurred and booted rider, his swarthy
face gray vrith fi st, strode in, nodded
to the group and called for whisky.
"Which way did he go. Saunders?'
asked one.
"North, as usual," said the rider.
"Let's sot down," suggested the third
man.

They shuffled to a table. The bar

then, uninvited, he pulled up a chair
and sat with them. The rider looked
at him pointedly
"Oh. I'm in on this!" asserted the
bartender. "Daugherty is the Wclls
Fargo man here. He won't talk to no
body but me—about business."
"What's that got to do with it?"
queried the rider.
"Just what you'd notice. Saunders
Listen! The rat left a bag of dust in

see hero, boys, we got to find out if
he's filed on it yet and what his name
is, and then"—
"Mebby we'd better find ont where
it is first," suggested one.
"And then jump him?" queried the
rider over bis glass.
"And then jump him," chorused the
group. "He's out there alone. It's
easy." And each poured himself a
drink, for which, strangely enough, no
one offered to pay, and for which the
bartender evidently forgot to collect.
Meanwhile the prospector toiled
through the drought of that summer
hoarding the little yellow flakes that
he washed from the gravel in the can
yon.
All round him for miles each way
the water holes had gone dry. The
little canyon stream still wound down
its shaded course, disappearing in a
patch of sand at tire canyon's mouth,
so the prospector felt secure. Non
had ridden out to look for him through
that furnace of burning sand that
stretched between- the hills and the
desert town.
The stream dwindled slowly, imper
r-eptihly.
One morning the prospector noticed
it ami immediately explored the creek
to its source, a spurt of water spring
iug from the roof of a grotto in the
cliff. Such a supply, evidently from
the rocky heart of the range itself,
would be inexhaustible.
A week later he awoke to find the
creek* bed dry save in a few depre9

days' journey from the canyon. This

but his canteen supply would more
than last till he reached it.
Then fate, the fate that had dogged
his every step since first he ventured
into the solitudes, closed up and crept
at his heels. He became more morose
and strangely fearful. His vision, re
fined by the wasting of his body, creat
ed shadows that lay about his feet like
stagnant pools, shadows where no
shadows should be.
Ominous was his fall as he crossed
an arroyo. The canteen, slung over
his shoulder, struck a sharp point of

canteen felt strangely light. He conld

struck straight from the hills toward

he would, as lie journeyed west, cross

CHAPTER II.
Ragged Romance.
T the wide gate of the mountain
ranch stood the girl. Her black
saddle pony Boyar fretted to lie
away. Glancing back through
the cavernous shade of the live oaks,
the girl hesitated before opening the
gate. A little breeze wayfaring
through Moonstone canyon and on up
to the mountain ranch touched the
girl's cheek, and she breathed deeply
of its cool fragrance.
The wide gate swung open, and Lou
ise Lnchanne, curbing Black Boyar,
rode out of the shadows into the hot
light of the morning, singing as she
rode.
Tlie girl's eyes, the color of sea wa
ter in the sun, were leveled toward the
distant hills across the San Fernando
valley. From her fingers dangled the
long bridle reins. Her lips were gen
lly parted. Her gaze was the gaze of
one who dreams in the daylight. And
close lu the hidden meadow crouched
Romance. Romance ragged, unkempt
jocular.
Boyar first scented the wood smoke.
Louise noticed his forward stnndin,
ears a ml. his fidgeting. Immediately
before her was the low rounded rock,
a throne of dreams that she had graced
before. From down the slope and al
most hidden by the bulk of the rock
a little wand of smoke stood up in the
windless air. to break at last into tiny
shreds and curls of nothingness.
It can't be much of a fire yet!" ex
claimed Louise, forever watchful, as
are all the hill folk, for that dread,
ungovernable red monster of destruc
tion. a mountain fire. "It can't be
much of a fire yet."
The pony Boyar, delicately scenting
„something more than wood smoke,
snorted and swerved. Louise dismount
ed and stepped hurriedly round the
shoulder of the rock. A bristle beard
ed face confronted her. "No, it ain't
much of a fire yet. but our hired girl
she joined a movin' picture outfit, so
as two he things are doin' the best
we can chasin' a breakfnsL" And the
tramp. Overland Red, nigged, un
kempt, jocular, rose from his knees
beside a tiny blaze. He pulled n bleak
flop of felt from bis tangled hair In
an overaccentuated bow of welcome.
"We offer you the freedom of the
city, ma'am. Welcome to our midst
and kindly excuse appearances this
morning. Our trunks got delayed in
New York."
Unsmilingly the girl's level gray eyes
studied the tramp's face. Then her
glance swept him swiftly from bared
head to rundown heel. "I was just
making up my mind whether I'd stay
and talk with you or ask you to put
out your fire and go somewhere else.
But I think you are all right. Fleas®
put on your hat."
Overland Red's self assurance shrank
a little. The girl's eyes were direct
and fearless, yet not altogether un
friendly He thought that deep within
them dwelt a smile.
"You got my map all right." he said,
a trifle more respectfully. "Course we'll
douse the fire when we duck out of
here. But what do you think of Collie
here, my pal? Is he all right?"
Oh, he's only a boy." said Louise,
glancing casually at the youth crouch
ed above the fire.
The boy. a slim lad of sixteen or
thereabout, flushed beneath the batter
ed brim of his black felt haL He
watched the tomato can coffeepot in
tently. Louise couli^ not see his face.
Yes. miss. I'm all light and so is
he." And a humorous wistfulness crept
Into the tramp's eyes. "He's what you
might call a changeling."
"Changeling?"
"Uhuh! Always changin' around
from place to place when you're young.
Ain't that it?"
"Oh! And when you are older?" she
queried, smiling.
Overland Red frowned. "Oh, then
you're just a _tramp, a Willie, a Bo. a
hobo."
He saw the girl's eyes harden a lit
tle. He spoke quickly and, she Im
agined, truthfully. "I worked ton years
for one outfit once without a change.
And I never Unowed what It was to
do a day's work out of the saddle. You
know what that means."
"Cattle? Mexico?"
Overland Red grinned. "Say, you
was born in California, wasn't you?"
"Yes, of course."
"'Cause Mexico has been about the
only place a puncher could work that
long without doin' day labor on foot
half the year. Yes, 1 been there.
