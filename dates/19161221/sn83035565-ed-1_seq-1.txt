habitable for women prisoners. A

Municipal Prlson3
The Municipal Prisons were visit
9d by committees appointed by the
President. We are pleased to re-
ort that the condition in
prisons i3 constantly improving,
The conditions of the prisons at
Arcanum, Hollansburg, Palestflne,

was good.
The prison itself at New Madison
was clean, bmt the surroundings
were bad. The Board recommends
that New Madison secure a better
building in which to locate their
cells a place that would harmon
ize with their otherwise progres
slve town.
The Board finds that as in the
past, there is a public toilet in
connection with the Versailles pris
on. Some arrangement should be
made by which the public toilet
may be entirely separated from the
prison.
The prison at Rossburg is clean
and sanitary, but arrangements
should be mdae by which they can I
care for more than one .prisoner I
and the cells should be of iron in-
stead of wood. I
We again recommend that the I
rooms Jn which the prisoners are!
located should be kept clean, and I
free from rubbish of all kinds.
Infljrmary
The Infirmary located two and
one-half miles south of Greenville
Is on the Dayton and Northern
Traction line. The farm valued at
$125 per acre, contains two hun
dred and forty-one acres. Of this
farm fifteen acres is timber, five
acres garden, ten acres orchard
five acres lawn and barn yard
twenty-five acres timber, and the
remainder Is tillable.
There are' two brick buildings
in which the Superintendent's fam
ily and the Inmates are housed
Both of these buildings are - In ex

Plenty of well cooked, whole-

The capacity of the Infirmary is

At the present time the stock
at the Home consists of six cows
four horses, two hundred chickens.
The estimated net annual ex
penses, besides iprodupts, were
13,000. The estimated value of
ffirm products for the year was
$1,000.
The Home could comfortably
care for about seventy-nve cnii-
tnegedren, but its present population Is
torty-nve. Tne Doys ana gins are
kept in separate apartments, and
mer, with its well cultfvated vege
tables. -
Thrift and good management are
everywhere manifest.
We find that there are one or
more tubercular Inmates in the In
firmary at all times, and that the
other inmates come in contact with
such tubercular inmates and are
constantly subjected to the dangers
of tuberculosis, because the plan of
the buildings is such that this can
not be avoided; therefore we rec
ommend that the commissioners
make some permanent arrange
ments for the care of tubercular
inmates of the Infirmary out side
of that institution.
Children's Home
The Children's Home Is-situated
as follows: Two hundred and fifty
bushels of Irish potatoes, seventy
five bushels of sweet potatoes, fifty
bushels of turnips, eighty bushels
of onions, fifty bushels of beets.
four hundred and fifty-four bush
els of wheat, one hundred bushels
of rye, four hundred and forty
bushels of oats, seventy tons of hay,
one thousand five hundred bushels
of corn, seventy-five tons of ensil
age, twenty-five tons of straw.
The cellar contains the following
provisions: One hundred and
twontv-flvn nnrfa of annles. one
hundred and thirty-three quarts'
Wenty-five quarts of grapes, four'

is $500 per year.
The estimated set annual ex
penses besides products were
$14,470.59. The estimated valu
of farm products for the year was
$7,27J.5.
Last statistics show stoek as
follows: Fifty-one head of cat
tle (22 cowe), eight horses, one
hundred and forty-eight swine,
three hundred and fifty chickens.
Some of the farm products were
improvements the Superintendent
has done much the past year; the
domitories have been refloored and
their walls retinted; the former
misery has been divided into three
commodious bed-rooms; the barn
bulidines have been repainted;
and new fences built where it was
necessary.
It speaks well for the elciency
of the management at the Home,
that although the children are
under good discipline, yet a home
like atmosphere Drevails.
Conventions
At the State Convention at
Yorkstown, Ohio, our Board was
represented by Mrs. Malinda Mace
and Mrs. Mabel Selby. After this
conference, a meeting of the Board
was held and a report of the Con
ference given by the delegates.
This Conference was one of the
most helpful ever held in the state
for county visitors.
Expenses
The total expense of the Board
fo
r the year was $69.21.
This money was expened in vis
iting institutions and municipal
prisons, in sending delegates to the
State Conference at Toungstown,
Ohio, for telephone, postage and
stenographic work on the report.
