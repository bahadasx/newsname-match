Wealthy Bachelor Farmers of North
Dakota See Chicago Girls—
"We Want Wives"
"0, a hundred Lochinvars have come
out of the West
Chicago Daily Tribune: Some time
this afternoon several automobiles will
swing at Madison and Dearborn streets
in front of the Tribune building. The
front car will bear a sign:
"We Want Wives"—Bachelor I*
Farmers of North Dakota
There will be about 100 of the
wealthiest bachelor farmers of the
state in state in those cars. Their
farm lands and other properties ag­
gregate an estimated value of $50,000,-
The purpose of the automobile trip,
which was planned last night by F. R.
Crane, director of agricultural expan­
sion of the Great Northern railway, is
to give these husky, unwedded hus­
bandmen a chance to see how desirable
it is to become husbands by showing
them the type of girls Chicago is orna­
mented with.
Of the 600 North Dakota delegates
to the stock show who came in yester­
day on Louis Hill's Great Northern
farmers' special, these 100 pleaded
guilty to lacking partners in their joy3
and woes, joys predominating on their
Tolling North Dakota acres. The en­
ergetic Mr. Crane rounded up half a
dozen of the bachelors, who coyly ad­
mitted that if Chicago girls generally
are as pretty as some of those they
noticed in the stockyards district, they
might prolong their stay.
"If I can find a nice Chicago girl,
built kind of large," said P. G. Melby,
who owns 7,000 acres at Hatton, and is
a director of the Farmers and Mer­
chants National bank, "I'm certainly
going home a wedded man."
George Ingerbretson of Church
Ferry, owner of 1,500 acres and a lot
of prize cattle, is also interested in
bulk. "About 200 pounds," said George,
"ahd I'm a goner."
William Bhr of Minot wants a girl
that is slender and frail. He mention­
ed casually that his father is wdrth a
halfmillion dollars.
"Deutschland uber alles," said W.
Irysh of Bismarck. "If there's any
nice unattached German girl in Chi­
cago, I'm there."
"I'd be interested in a nice Chicago
girl that was Swedish, dark, and
plump," said Pete, "but not too Swed­
ish or too dark or too plump."
Besides his 1,800 acres Mr. Aschein
stated that he had quite a sum of
money.
ROSS MAN TO FACE
A SERIOUS CHARGE
William Crowder, of Ross, who some
time ago injured Alfred N. Olson, also
of Ross, is to face the charge of at­
tack with a dangerous weapon with
intent to kill, and the preliminary
hearing is set for Monday morning.
States Attorney Wyckoff will do_ the
prosecuting for the state, while it is
not known at this time what lawyer
Crowder will have to defend him. The
penalty for the crime, of which Crow­
der is charged is a very serious one,
and should he be found guilty, it will
mean a penitentiary term. Crowder
is now out on $2,000.00 bond. Much
interest will be taken in this case as
both parties are well known in this
section.
Mrs. W. M. New Awarded $650 Dam
ages Against Edw. Livingston
Mrs. W. M. New from north of the
city, who brot suit against Edward
Livingston, a wealthy farmer for $20,
800 for the death of her husband, was
awarded damages to the extent of
$650 in district court, the jury report­
ing Tuesday morning. The plaintiff
was represented by E. R. Sinkler and
the defendant by Bradford & Nash.
It is understood that Livingston of
fered to settle the case prior to the
trial for $1,500.
W. M. New was killed on the north
hill more than a year ago when an
auto driven by Edw. Livingston ran
into him, crushing his body against
the wagon behind which he was walk­
ing. Livingston was coming arouiid a
curve and seeing another auto coming
up the hill, attempted to bring his car
to a stop, and the brake not working
as he expected it would, he failed to
work the emergency in time.
TREES HIT BY LIGHTNING
According to the investigations by
the United States Forest Service, the
greatest number of trees struck by
lightning in any locality is the domi­
nant variety. Laboratory tests have
•hown that the conductivity of wood
depends on its water content. Mr.
Scott, Kansas State Forester, who has
investigated many of the old theories
about some trees being struck more by
lightning than others find that no
•pedes of tree is more susceptible to
lightning stroke than any other ex­
cept in so far as the species deter­
mines the height «f the tree.—N. D.

SHRUBS THAT ATTRACT BIRDS
Under the heading, "Shrubs That
Attract Birds" the Ohio State Univer­

mountain ash.—N. D. Exp. Sta.
"DRAKE FOR LIVE ONES"
A young lady at Drake bet a young
man of the city five dollars that he
dare not marry* her. The young man
proposed the same kind of a bet to

What It Means to the State of North
Dakota:
It means than 2,000,000 newspapers
will be sent out of the state during the
week, bearing the glad news of the
state's natural resources and prosper­
ity.
It means that 100,000 essays on
North Dakota will be written by the
school children of North Dakota.
It means that hundreds of preachers
will preach sermons extolling the re­
sources of the State of North Dakota.
It means that scores of commercial
organizations will hold Appreciation
Week dinners with addresses setting
forth the greatness of our grand state.
It me'ans that every household in
North Dakota will observe Baked Po­
tato Day, Thursday, January 25th, by
eating baked potatoes, thus letting the
world at large know that North Da­
kota raises the best potatoes of bak­
ing size in the world, and also teach­
ing our own people that the raising of
prime potatoes is the only true sys­
tem.
GREAT NORTHERN CONDUCT­
OR MAY LOSE CRUSHED LEG
Jack McHenry Thrown Under Wheels
at Palermo and Received Hor­
rible Injury
Jack McHenry, well known Great
Northern conductor, was seriously in­
jured Saturday night at Palermo when
he was thrown off the caboose, the
wheels running over one of his legs
between the ankle and the knee. The
injured man was brought to a local
hospital where everything possible is
being done to save the leg. The bones
were horribly crushed and if the leg
is saved, it will be considerably short­
er than the other. The Great North­
ern company's surgeon is watching the
case closely and it may be possible
that the limb will have to be ampu­
tated.
Mr. McHenry was standing on the
end of the caboose and when the slack
was taken up in the train he was pre­
cipitated under the wheels. He is pop­
ular with a great many who trust that
he will have a rapid recovery.
KEEP BOTTLE'S LOCATION
^STRICTLY ON THE QUIET
New Bootlegging Law in Effect Re­
cently Holds Drastic Penalties
—Use Good Judgment
Should you know the whereabouts
of a bottle and should you tell a
friend about it, and should someone
learn that you told your friend, and
should that someone be intent upon
the observance of the prohibition laws
to the very letter, you might get in
very, very bad.
For the recently adopted bootleg­
ger amendment became effective re­
cently and the bootlegger amendment
is pretty far reaching and wide
spreading in its efforts to rout demon
rum. Under this amendment before
one makes a good fellow of himself
by tipping off the source of a little
nip, it would be well to require the
tippee to give the grand hailing sigm
of distress and certain other little
assurances that he isn't a squealer.
It is anticipated that the bootlegger
amendment will make the enforce­
ment of the prohibition law much less
difficult for local officers the state over.
Olaf Olson Loses Two Cases
Atty. D. C. Greenleaf was awarded
a judgment against Olaf A. Olson in
district Court for $575 for work done
as a former attorney for Mr. Olson.
The case has been in litigation for
some years.
A. S. Blakey was awarded a verdict
for $150 against Olaf A. Olson. Olson
had sued Blakey for three months'
rent of" a room formerly occupied by
the Blakey drug store. Blakey put in
a counter claim for $150 more than the
rent amounted to because some of his
goods were damaged by the breaking
of water pipes.
The work in district court will be
completed Friday so that the jurors
can all be home for Christmas.
Minot Stores Remain Open Evenings
The Minot stores are keeping open
this week until nine o'clock each eve­
ning, to give those who desire to do
their Christmas shopping an oppor­
tunity to do so.
The cold weather the past few days
has kept a good many of the country
folks at home and many of the town
people have showed an inclination to
toast their shins at their own firesides,
but this week the stores are filled with
shoppers.
The Minot merchants have better
Christmas stocks than ever before.
The gifts include a great many useful
articles which cannot help but be ap­
preciated by the recipients. Minot
shoppers are buying liberally realiz­
ing that "it is more blessed to give
than to receive." There's a great deal
more pleasure in it too.
INTEREST ON FEDERAL
FARM LOAN MORTGAGES
In paying the interest on a Federal
Farm Loan mortgage a part of the
principal must be paid each time ao
that when the last interest payment is
made the principal is also paid. This
is called amortization. It is based on
the principle that a loan should be so
invested as to earn more than the in­
terest.

Jew overheard the transaction. His
record being good he was also admit­
ted and told he might also have any
wish granted. "I don't want much,"
the crafty fellow replied. "Just give
me $50 worth of phoney jewelry and
fifteen minutes with that nigger," he
requested.

POOL HALL LOCKED
UP EOR A TIME
Officers Discover "Plant" in Propriet­
or's Overcoat—Clever Way of
Handling Booze
Roy Vaughn, proprietor of the pool
hall, located in the basement of the
Leland block, was arrested during a
raid Friday evening by Deputy Sher­
iff Vandenoever and States Attorney
Herigstad and his assistant, Dorr H.
Carroll.
Vaughn was searched and a bottle
partially filled with whiskey was
found on his person. This was not
enough liquor to warrant arresting
him, so the officers continued their
search for the "plant" which was fin­
ally found in Vaughn's overcoat hang*
ing in the room. Six bottles of whis­
key were found in the pockets. Vaughn
claimed that he did not know who own­
ed the coat but his name was found
sewed in the coat and the keys to the
place were found in a pocket. The
room has been locked under injunc
tional proceedings.
KLEMPLE CASE SETTLED
Velva, N. D., Dec. 18. The
case of the state versus the Klem
ple brothers, who were arrested as a
result of a big scrap at Strawberry
Lake last summer, in which the deputy
sheriff of McLean county and two oth­
er men were badly beaten and one of
the Klemple brothers was shot in
the leg, has been settled. W. W.
Vaughn of this city was a witness of
the fracas and had been subpoenaed by
by the state. He has been advised by
the states attorney of McLean county
that two of the principals had arrang­
ed to plead guilty to assault and bat­
tery and the action against the oth­
ers has been dismissed. The case was
to have come up at Bismarck this
week.
THE FEDERAL FARM LOAN ACT
(Twelve Articles Article No. 5)
Easy Payment Plan
The new act provides for lending
money to farmers largely on the bor­
rower's terms. While the mortgage
must run at least five years and not to
exceed forty years, and must be paid
on the installment plan, yet the farm­
er chooses the time to run and the
size of the installment.
The amortization plan, as the in­
stallment plan is now called, is the
easiest plan for paying off a debt. It
is also the cheapest plan, for it re­
quired less money for interest. Un­
der the act, the interest rate cannot
exceed six per cent, and the amortiza­
tion payments, to meet principal and
interest, must be in fixed annual or
semi-annual installments. However,
after five years the mortgage may be
paid off any time. If a farmer bor­
rows $1,000 at six per cent for ten
years under our present credit system,
he pays back the loan, principal and
interest, $1,600, the annual interest
payment being $60. If he borrows
the same amount at the same rate un­
der the new act, he pays back the loan,
principal and interest, $1358.70, the
annual interest and principal being
$135.87. This makes the amortiza­
tion plan a little cheaper, even if we
figure to the farmer interest on the
use of the money which the farmer
has under the old system, that is, on
the use of the difference between the
two payments of $60 and $135.87. And
the new plan is easier because his an­
nual payment of $135.87 amortizes
(kills off) the debt at the end of ten
years. But under our present credit
method, after paying $60 a year in­
terest for ten years, the borrower then
faces the original debt of $1,000 and
this may mean foreclosure or renewal
of the loan.—J. E. B., N. D. Exp. Sta.
Martin Jacobson's Bulls Are Dandies
Martin Jacobson received the ship­
ment of the two Hereford bulls which
he bought at the Chicago National
Stock Show. The animals attracted
a great deal of attention Saturday as
they were led through the streets of

bred in New Hampshire and are a
little past two years of age, weigh­
ing 1800 pounds each. Mr. Jacobson
paid $450 each for them and he con­
siders the investment the very best.
They are built perfectly for beef ani­
mals, being low, long and broad. They
are exceedingly gentle and those who
saw them consider them the very best
bulls of the kind ever brought to this
section of the state.
Hecht Buys Valuable Young Stallion
Major E. S. Person and Col. H. J.
Heclit have returned from Iowa where
Mr. Hecht invested in fifteen brood
mares and a registered Belgian stal­
lion, a yearling weighing 1780 pounds.
The animal was sired by the grand
champion Belgian horse at the San
Francisco exposition, an animal owned
by Wm. Crownover of Hudson, la., for
which the owner refused $18,000. Mr.
Crownover expects that he will sell the
stallion to the Belgian government at
the close of the war. The sire weighs
2500 pounds and the dam 2200.
The mares are mostly good grades,
there being two pure bred animals in
the lot. One of them will be offered
for sale.
