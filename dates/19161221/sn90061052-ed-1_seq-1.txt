ANNUAL mtiM
COMMERCIAL CLUB
OFFICERS TO BB ELECTED
FOR COMING YEAR
Secretarys Report will Show a
Good Years Work AH
Members Attend
The first annual meeting of the Com
merclnl Club will meet tonight Thurs
day December 2V to elect officers for
the cusulng year and to hear reports of
officers and committees of the work ac
complished the parit year
Frankly wed like to write about n
column of encouragement for the club
members and extend congratulations
to the active members for what they
huve accomplished for tbis section of
the county during the first yen rs ex
istence of the club Hut every mini
knows in hisr heart the worth of the
of this organized TciTort on the part of
these public spirited men If some of
these men are a little discouraged and
feel a little sense of Injustice why is
it Of course all citizens town and
rural reap the benefits but so few are
willing to put their shoulders to the
wheel and work for the good of all the
community These officers and active
members can stand a certain amount of
this and do but it gets tiresome
burdensome to carry theothcr fellows
load all the time when he gets as mucn
benefit ns anyone else
The Jasper Commercial Club has not
pleased everybody Its most enthusi
astic supporters did not expect it to Its
best friends were sometimes divided as
as to action in certain cases but in
most cases they compromised and
united knowing that to succeed the
majority must rule There have been
such instances as that of a member
with hyplcar drawing his support en
tirely from the club because a hundred
dollars or so was spent to beautify the
city park when this member wanted the
money ro go to the country roads and
another member threatens to quit be
cause a certain piece of road is not
fixed
Say what you will this organization
has been worth more to this county
than ony other organization of the
same kind in year and all this in the
face of the dullest period this section
has experienced in a long time Jas
per has got more advertising of the
right sort from Kansas City down into
Oklahoma and for a like distance east
and west
Jasper cant afford to be without a
commercial club the community cant
afford it the individual citizen cant
afford it Now boys lets take a hitch
in our belts and start the new year with
the determination to support the com
mercial club nnd thereby conserve our
own interests Dont sit to one side
and say Let George do it Dont be
a human leech drawing your suste
nance from the community without
giving something toward it more than
the tax collector takes away from you
by law

High School Basket Ball
Golden City and Jasper high school
teams opened the basket ball season in
Jasper last Friday night with n lively
game
It was a beautiful game from a Jas
per standpoint through the first half
but the lost half was another story and
the Jasper boys lost by 4 points after
they thought they had a double riveted
cinch on the game
In the first half the Jasper five walked
away with the G C boys and when
the bell tapped at the end of the first
half the score book showed Jasper to
have scored 20 points while their oppo
nents made 8 Right here the Jasper
manager became so sure of his boys
that he put in two or three subs which
Is S good move If you dont overdo it
but it sure worked the wrong way this
time The Golden City boys ran away
with the new lineup and by the help
of some rough play by the subs for
which the umpire penalized the Jasper
team the Barton County boys scored
23 points while Jasper scored 7 mak
ing the final total Golden City 31
Jasper 27
The lineup was as follows
Jasper R Hand and Truax for
ards Moulton center Dunning and
Goddard guards C Hand Woodman

Golden City Hasue and Harrah for
