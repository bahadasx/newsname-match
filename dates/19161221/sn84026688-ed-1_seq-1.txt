OLD CUSTOMS?
By CASSIE MONCLURE LYNE.
✓v. 1 AVB the customs of
Il * t>re conventlo'nali
-1 n;rub. We do things
like mechanical
1-oAi &*..s)) toys, without usk
ing the why and
■■" wherefore. We fol
low like sheep the leadership of some
foolish friend who either has more
cents and less sense than the average,
because we are the slaves of custom.
Christmas is the season for the Christ-
Child —when simplicity and sincerity
should dominate love of ostentation
and all pretense. It Is hard in this
day of luxury to experience a new sen
sation ; for children are sated on the
threshold of life with gifts that would
have astonished George Washington
and taken away the breath of little
backwoods Abraham Lincoln. It is no
use telling your child to eat his red
apple and suck his stick of candy with
a thankful heart if little Bobble next
door owns a motorcycle and a real pig
skin. Precious poor fun will your lit
tle Mary Jane find in her rag baby If
Inez Dorris has a bisque French doll
that can talk. And so we are happy or
miserable, poor or rich by contrast;
those comparisons that are obvious If
odious.
Yule Log Is Gone.
The old-fashioned season of fun and
frolic has been replaced by a meaning
less, mirthless celebration. The Yule
log has gone out, and there Is no fire
place for old Santa Claus to scramble
down and leave his gifts of simple
Joys for unsuspecting childhood. The
steam-heated home, the sterilized ur
chin, the pure-food laws, all forbid the
painted sugar cats and dogs whose
green hacks would have put any par
rot to shame.
Yet how beautiful In retrospect Is
the memory of some Christmas of the
long ago, when, like Tiny Tim, who
gathered around the simple table and
looked forward with Joy to the home
coming of all the family, the wonder
ful dinner of goose and the loving
greeting, “God bless us all 1” That
was a wealth such as no Scrooge could

possibly buy I That was tin* spirit
which prompted Dickens to say,
“Though it has never put a scrap of
gold or silver in my pocket, I believe
it lias done me good, and I say, ‘God
bless it!’ ”
We Should Hang Garlands.
The singing of carols In English vil
lages was a good old custom and ought
to be revived, as well as the lighting
of the Yule log on Christmas eve, for
the memory of the English Christmas
Ungers ever in the British heart, wher
ever he may be. In the early days at
Jamestown, Va., the cradle of English
civilization on this western continent,
John Smith says: “The extreme cold,
frost, rain and snow caused us to keep
Christmas among the savages, where
we were never more merry nor had
more good oysters, fish, tlesh, wild fowl
and good bread nor ever bad bet
ter fires in England." Kipling, too,
refers to the memory of Yuletide in his
“Black Sheep” with the couplet, “At
home they are making merry, twlxt
the white and scarlet berry.” And so
we should garland the house with trail
ing pine, hang the wreaths of holly in
the window and the mistletoe ’neath
the chandelier. It helps others If It
does hot help you.
Boston’s Fine Example.
Last Christmas in Boston the mayor
requested everyone In tlie city to leave
their window shades up on Christmas
eve to help light the city. Such a
cheerful glow as it gave to old Bea
con street and Commonwealth avenue 1
Down in the I’ublic gardens the city
was enjoying its municipal Christmas
tree, a stately fir, bedecked with myri
ad colored electric bulbs, while the
band played old familiar carols that
veered into popular street songs be
fore the crowd scattered. The scene
was significant of Christmas now be
ing a cosmopolitan festival holding
the heart of Puritan New England,
whose holy of holies has heretofore
been Thanksgiving. This is right, and
as it should be, since ours is a land
of religious liberty and Christmas is
the season of "peace and good will
to all mankind.”
A LITTLE BABY SISTER.
"Why don’t you send your little
friend a nice wax doll foi^Chrlstmas?”
“I don’t think she’d care much for
n wax doll now, auntie; you see, they
Just got a meat one at her house.”
Evidently Not.
“Confound the luck 1 What did she
want to slap me for? She was stand
ing squarely beneath a bunch of mis
tletoe when I kissed her.”
“Son, I’m surprised at your obtuse
ness.”
"Well?”
“I suspect that you were not the
man she was waiting for.”

.* upon a time,
a V Jj/ryv long, long ago, the
1 J J great - great • ever
so-great grandfu
ther of Happy Jack
Squirrel, whose
' name was Happy
•' Jack, too, was
imw scampering along
the Lone Little Path that comes down
the hill through the Green Forest.
He was happy, very happy, was Hap
py Jack, which was quite as It should
he, for there was everything to make
him happy. His sides were fat with
the good things he had to eat. Ho had
a beautiful new coat to keep him warm
when rough Brother North Wind and
Jack Frost should come driving the
snow clouds to make white the Green
Meadows and change the Green Forest
until the little people who live there
only In the summer would never, never
known it hud they happened to have
come back. But rough Brother North
Wind and Jack Frost hod not come
yet, and Old Mother Nature was busj
preparing the Green Forest for them
und urging all the little people to hur
ry and make ready for them.
So Happy Jack scampered down the
Lone Little I’uth and pulled over red
leaves and yellow leaves und brown

and Song Would Cut Young Pine Trees and Carry them Away.
loaves to see what he could tlnd under
them, and his heart was happy, for
his stomach was full, and you know a
full stomach, unless it be too full, al
most always makes a happy heart.
Now, us he pulled over the red and
yellow and brown leaves, his sharp
eyes spied a little brown seed. It was
a homely little seed which hud fallen
from a rough pine cone, and you and
I would very likely not have seen It
at all, or if we had we would have
thought It of no account. But Happy
Jack's eyes sparkled when he saw that
homely little brown seed, for he knew
that It was very good to eat.
Not that he was hungry. Oh, my,
no 1 There wasn’t room In his stomach
for the least teeny, weeny bit more
Just then. But Happy Jack knew that
there might come a time U'hen his
stomach would not be so full, and then
that little brown seed would taste oh,
bo good!
Now, he hud hidden a great many
little brown seeds and fat nuts near
the Lone Little Path, so when ho
picked up this particular little brown
seed quickly he scampered over the dry
leaves until presently he came to the
edge of the Green Forest. He looked
this way and he looked that way to
see if anyone was watching him, and
when he was sure that no one was, he
ran out a little way from the edge of
the Green Forest, dug a tiny hole in
the soft, warm earth with his paws,
dropped into It the little brown seed
md covered it carefully.
“There,” said he to htmselt, os he
scampered back to the Green Forest
to see what more he could tind, ‘every
jne knows I live in the Green Forest
and no one will think to look out nere
for things I have hidden.”
Old Mother Nature, who knew just
what Happy Jack had done, smiled, for
she also knew that it was more than
likely that Happy Jack would forget
all about that little brown seed, and if
he did she hud a plan to use it her
self, and Happy Jack hud saved her
some trouble, for, though he didn’t
know It, he had planted It for her.
It all came about Just as Old Mother
Nature had thought It would. Happy
Jack never once thought of that par
ticular little brown seed, for he had
hidden plenty to eat ull the long win
ter In the Green Forest. So the little
brown seed lay Just where he hud hid
den it, until gentle Sister South Wind
came In the spring and with her soft
lingers opened all the little brown
blankets of the leaf buds on the trees
which Jack Frost with his hard lingers
had been unable to open. Then Old
Mother Nature remembered the little
brown seed, und she wakened a little
fairy who was sleeping in the heart of
It, und the name of the little fairy was
the Fairy of Life.
So out from the'warm earth sprang
u tender green shoot, which really was
a teeny, weeny Pine-tree.
Jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun, look
ing down from the blue, blue sky, saw
it and smiled, and his smile made the
teeny, weeny Pine-tree very happy, for
It wanned the ground and comforted
the little roots growing there.
Old Mother West Wind, hurrying
past on her way to blow the white
sailed ships across the Great Ocean,
saw the teeny, weeny Pine-tree and
sent some of her children, the Merry
Little Breezes, to drive up a shower
cloud that It might not go thirsty.
But no one else saw the teeny, weeny
Pine-tree, or if they did see it, they
took no notice of It. Happy Jack
Squirrel ran right past and didn’t so
much as look at it, for he had forgot
ten nil about hiding that homely little
brown seed In the ground there. Once
Peter Rabbit, nibbling tender sweet
clover, nearly nipped oft the head of
the teeny, weeny Pine-tree and didn’t
even know it.
But nothing really happened to the
teeny, weeny Pine-tree, and It grew
and grew and was happy, for it loved
Jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun and Old
Mother West Wind and the Merry
Little Breezes, and they loved it. So
it grew and grew, and when rough
Brother North Wind came again he
covered It deep with a soft blanket of
snow to keep it warm all winter.
So the teeny, weeny Pine-tree was
kept safe all the long winter, and when
gentle Sister South Wind once more
came in the spring the teeny, weeny
Pine-tree began to grow again. It
grew and grew and grew and grew
until it was no longer teeny, weeny,
but put out sturdy branches and was
very good to look upon and held Its
head high, for it was indeed a beauti
ful young tree.
And for a time the young Pine-tree
was very, very happy. But after a
.while It began to feel lonely. All the
'other Pine-trees were In the Green
Forest, and often it could hear them
whispering together and it longed to
whisper with them and could not, and
so it sighed and sighed, and Peter Rab
bit passing that way often stopped to
wonder what made such a Handsome
young Pine-tree seem so sad.
So the years passed and the young
Pine-tree became bigger than any of
Its neighbors In the Green Forest, and
became known us the Beautiful Pine.
hnd was beloved of ull the little people
of the Green Forest und the Green
Meadows, and gave them shelter und
was hnppy.
Once every yeur, long ufter the nuts
hud been gathered und ull the world
seemed drear und bare, came merry
children, and older folk, and with
luugh und song und happy shout would
cut young Pine trees and young Hem
lock trees and carry them away. At
first the Beautiful Pine had pitied the
young trees, but when it saw that it
was the possession of these trees that
made the children so happy, it began
to envy them, and when Jack Frost
told It of peeping in st many win
dows and seeing these little trees
made beautiful with many lights, and
hung with beautiful things to fill the
hearts of little children with joy, it
sighed more than ever.
“For,” murmured the Beautiful Pine
to the kindly stars, “I would gladly
give myself to put joy In the heart of
just one little child; but, alas! I am
too big. I am too big. No little child
wants me because I am too big.”
So Christmas after Christinas the
Beautiful Pine would watch the little
trees carried away and would mur
mur sadly, “I can give Christmas Joy
to not one little child because 1 am
too Mg, too big.” Ami the wandering
Night Wind would carry that sad mur
mur through all the Green Forest, "1
uni too big, too big.”
Then, one day, when the snow lay
white on the Green Meadows and in
the Green Forest, and the Beautiful
Pine had watched the little trees for
Christinas carried away with laugh
und shout, as It had for so many
Christmases, came men and horses,
und keen axes sent shivers clear to its
beautiful top. until its proud length
lay stretched on the snow. And some
how the beautiful Pine oared not, for
It so wanted to give joy to Just one
little child, and It was too big. too big.
It was. carried into a great city, and
there, In the very heart of the great
city, the Beautiful Pine was raised un
til It stood as proudly as It had stood
Just beyond the edge of the Green For
est, and It was hung with many colored
lights until it was quite, quite the most
beautiful that ever was. And there
came not one, hut a thousand little
children, and they danced around the
Beautiful Pine, and laughter was in
their eyes, for joy was In their hearts.
And they sang and their voices were
Joyous. And they shouted and theit
voices were merry. And they cried;
"It is the most beautiful tree in all
the world, for it is our Christmas
tree—the Christmas tree of all the
children!"
Then was the heart of the Beauti
ful Pine, planted long, long years ago
by the grent-great-ever-so-greut grand
father of Happy Jack Squirrel, filled
with a great Joy—the joy of giving, for
It had given its greatest gift, the gift
of itself, for the Joy of many. And
the spirit of Christmas, which is love
for all mankind, descended upon it as
sweet-toned bells chimed, “On earth
pence, good will toward men,” and the
glad voices of u thousand little chil
dren cried, "Merry merry Christmas!’*

NOW it came to pass in those day,
there went out a decree from Caesar
Augustus, that all the world should
be enrolled. This was the first enrollment
made when Quirinus was governor of
Syria And all went to enroll themselves,
everyone to his own city
And Joseph also went up from Galilee,
out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea,
to the city of David, which is called Beth
lehem, because he was of the house and
family of David; to enroll himself with
Mary, who was betrothed to him. being
great with child.
And it came to pass, while they ware
there the days were fulfilled that she
should be delivered. And she brought
forth her first-born son and she wrapped
him in swaddling clothes and laid him in
a manger because there was no room for
them in the inn.
And there were shepherds in the
same country abiding in the field, and
keeping watch by night over their flock.
And an angel of the Lord stood by
them and the glory of the Lord shone
round about them; and they were sore
afraid.
And the angel said unto them: •‘Be
not afraid, for behold I bring you good
tidings of great joy, for there is born to
you this day in the city of David a Saviour
which is Christ, the Lord. And this is the
sign unto you: ‘Ye shall find a baoe
wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying
in a manger.' ”
And suddenly there was with the
angel a multitude of the heavenly host,
praising God and saying .
‘ Glory to God in the highest
‘And on earth peace good will
