An Appeal to Reason.
(From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.)
Mr. Bryan says so much that Is true
about the abuse of drink and the de
leterious influence of saloons under
existing condtions that the unthink
ing accept his conclusion without ex
amination of this logic '
It does not follow because the
abuse of drink and the saloon causes
many evils that the attempt to forbid
: the manufacture, sale and use of in
toxicants la the right thing or that it
will wipe out the evils of. drink and
of the existing saloon system. It will
merely change their form. .The ulti
mate results in the evils of drink, the
degeneration of ' character through
hypoorisy, the multiplying ofGovern
mental spies and law offloers for the
. purpose of controlling the' conduot
of the people with regard to drink
and the inevitable corruption of Oov
. ernmental agents which arises from
: the attempted police control of con
duct will be worse than present con
ditions. ,( .
The appeal to conscience on the
, subject of drink ought logically to be
an appeal to the conscience of each
man as a free moral agent. ' It ought
. ' never to be an appeal to the con
sciences of a part of the people to con
trol the consciences and oonduo t of

another part in matters not inherent
ly criminal.
The right to continue the business
of liquor selling so as to minimize the
evils of drink or to meet an emer
gency in the public interest cannot be
denied, but to carry this control into
prohibitions of any authorized manu
facture or sale or use of liquor and
thus to attempt to regulate personal
conduct is wrong In principle and vi
cious In practice. It enaots the spirit
of Intolerance into law and puts an
impossible and evil-producing task on
government.
-The subject of handling intoxicants
ought not be left either to those who
have a pecuniary interest in it or
to those who have a political In
terest, or to hysterical evangelists and
campaigners who appeal to prejudice
and emotion without regard to prin
ciples or consequences. The danger
of bad e fleets on government and the
Individual Is too grave.
A question so vital to the welfare of
the people and to the maintenance of
law, order and good government
should be examined carefully and in
telligently. Governmental action
should be based upon wise conclusions
in the light ,ot principles, facts and
human experience,

Home-Made Bread Best.
riome-made bread, if well made, is
to be preferred over bakers' bread,
according to Miss Addie D. Root of
the Missouri College of Agriculture.
The condition of the yeast used in
bread making is more important than
the kind of yeast. It yeast is allowed
to Btand in a dusty place or is put into
an unsterilized vessel, it will collect
bacteria and the bread will have a
sour, unpleasant taste. All utensils
and liquids should be scalded before
using.
Yeasts are small plants which need
air. "Flour, therefore, should bemadd
ed slowly and beaten into the liquid
thoroughly to incorporate air. Sugar
isjood for the yeast plant and If giv
en it will hasten it growi.
If dough is too stiff, a harsh, crumb
ly bread results, The least amount of
flour possible to avoid a sticky dough,
gives the best bread.
The quick even stroke in kneading
counts for more than the strength
put into it. A thorough kneading
distributes the yeast plants evenly
throughout the dough and results in
bread of the best texture - as the gas
bubbles rise evenly. ' Dough should
be kneaded until It has a smooth vel
vety surface. If kneaded longer than
thirty minutes, the elastio quality is
completely destroyed. ..
Yeaet plants thrive at a temperature
of from 79 to 05 degrees Fahrenheit.
When dough is set to rise, it should
be placed In a clean bowl. If the bowl
is covered tightly and an even tem
perature maintained, it is not neces
sary either to oil or moisten the surface
to prevent a crust from forming. If
the temperature is too high, the bread
will be dark, coarse, and sour. If the
dough Is chilled while rising, the
volume will be smaller, .the texture
rubbery, aid an undesirable crust will
form, Best results are obtained when
dough is kept at a gentle, warm, even
temperature until It is twice Its bulk,
and then, worked.
Baking requires as much care sb
mixing, kneading, and rising. The
temperature of the oven should be
3G0 degrees Fahrenheit when the
bread Is placed In it. It should be al
lowed to rise after fifteen minutes
and lowered after thirty minutes.
The bread should begin to brown in
patohes during the first fifteeen min
utes and should have an even brown
surface after thirty minutes. If the
dough Is not twice its original bulk or
as light as desired, It may be allowed
to flnlBh rising In the oven.

OUR PUBLIC FORUM
Chas. C. Prouty
ON THE SHIPPER AND THE RAILROAD.
Chas. C. Prouty,whlle a member of "the Interstate Com
merce Commission, In discussing the relation of the
Commission to the shipper and the railroad, said:
"The original purpose of the Interstate Commerce
Act was to protect the shipper. The most eminent man
who ever sat on the Interstate Commerce Commission
was Us first chairman, Juige Ccoley, and very early in
the history of that commission Judge Cooley published
an opinion In which he said that the business of the
commission was not to enable railroads to maintain
reasonable rates, but to protect shippers against the
Imposition of unreasonable rates. Now I think since
Judge Cooley published that opinion conditions hav
1 1
Changed. I think that today It Is lust
to see that the railroads are given reasonable rates which will yield to thejn
a fair return, as It is to see that no unreasonable rate is charged the shipper,
and I believe this Is la the highest Interest of the shipper himself. ' i
i
"At the basis of all right thinking about this subject lies the fact, very
often stated, very little apprehended, that the railroad is a public servant.
The property la private property, but the thing done is a governmental func
tion. It Is done by the government In most European countries. Now, if the
government Is the master, and If the railroad is the servant, the servant can
not properly discharge Its duty unless the master, Instead of hampering and
discouraging, sees fit to assist and foster.
"You understand that It the business of this country is to develop the
railroads must develop also, l ou also understand that in the case of many
railroad systems, and perhaps most railroad systems, their business is de
veloped up to the point where but little additional business could be taken
on, with the present facilities.
"Now where Is the money to come from with which this Is to be done?
Where did the money come from that built the railroads of this country? It
came from the private Investor; it came from exactly the same source that
the money comes which operates your business, which operates every other
business. And why was that money put Into railroads? It was put into rail
roads because the people who put it into those railroads believed that it would
pay a return. This money which muBt be had by the railroads of this country
has got to come from this one source private investors. In the past, railroads
have been able to borrow whatever their necessities required. Railroad
stocks have been a favorite, form of Investment Railroad bonds, next to
municipal bonds, have sold higher than any other securities. Now, if that is
to continue, it must be because the railroads make such earnings aa will
justify the investment."
Socialists to Meet.
The Hague, Netherlands, Nov. 18.
As many as 14 different national sec
tions are being invited to take partinJ
the Socialist conference of entente
countries which is being organized by
the Socialist Internationale' of this
city, namely, Britain, France, Italy,
Portugal, Canada, Australia and New
Zealand. The delegates of the entente
Socialists are to meet in London,
probably in January iiexi, the con
ference having been called on the
initiative of the party in France.
More significance naturally attaches
to the decisions which may be arrived
at than was the case with the less In
fluential conference of neutral Social
ists held at The Hague some months
since.
The program, as published here,
aims at establishing common action
with a view to directing the policy of
their respective countries in the di
rection of nonannexation, the guar
anteeing of the rights of . the nations
by international institutions, and the
exclusion from all economic treaties
of everything that would contain the
germs of flesh conflicts. It will be re
called that while the International
Socialist Bureau is still In touch with
the parties of the central empires 88
well as of the entente countries, it has
not yet succeeded in its ultimate ob
ject of bringing all Socialist parties
together again on a common agreed
policy in regard to the war. It is
doubless hoped that the coming Lon
don conference will bring the desired
goal nearer.
Farmers' Week, 1917.
"Farmers' Week, 1917" is Missouri's
agricultural congress convening in
Columbia on the first day of the New
Year the people's own meeting, a
round-table council of country life for
five days and nights.
Everybody is welcomed. Although
it is not necessary to be appointed as
a delegate to be received in full fel
lowship, county oourts, commercial
Clubs, granges, unions and farm clubs
are requested to send delegates. Each
reader is asked to bring this queston
up before his organization and ask
that one delegate be appointed for
each ten members. County Courts
name one person for each township.
Special delegations of town and coun
try folks are being made up, and
some will come in special Pullmans to
be used for Bleeping quarters during
the week, '
The forenoon and afternoon farmers'
short oourse program has been an
nounced by the College of Agricul
ture, and Is better than ever efore,
From 3:00 to 5:00 P. M. each day the
more than twenty state-wide associa
tions will hold annual sessions, each
state secretary calling his sessions and
planning independent program. A
state convention of farm clubs has al
so been called for Farmers' Week.
On Moud'ay, Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday nights the State Board
of Agriculture has prepared a pro
gram of general range of Interest,
tome portion of which will prove' at
tractive to each mvinberot the family
who may attend.
The Farmers' Banquet will be given
on Friday night at Rothwell Gymna
sium by the College of Agriculture.

Springfield Court of Appeals Judgeship.
' (Dunklin County Democrat.)
'Judge Argus Cox, contestee, on
December 7th, filed his answer In the
supr. me oourt, at Jefferson City, in
the election contest brought by John
H. Bradley of this city for the office
of judge of the Springfield court of
appeals.
Judge Cox in hia answer practically
admits every contention of the con
testant, except that the vjtersi
Maries county who voted for Johnson
intended to vote for the Democratic
nominee, which contention he specific
ally denies. At the time of filing his
answer, Judge Cox filed a motion
which requests the court to pass upon
the competency of a voter testifying
as to what he intended to do when he
cast a ballot. If the court holds that
it is competent for a voter to so tes
tify, it will pave the way for Bradley
to win.
If, however, the court rules that
this testimony is not competent and
that Bradley cannot prove what the
voters intended, then that will end
the matter and Bradley will lose.
The court gave each side ten days
to prepare and file briefs on the mo
tion, and after briefs are filed will
pass on samb in due time. How soon
it is hard to tell, but it is presumed
they will announce their decision in
a reasonable time.
If the court holds that the testi
mony of the voters as to their inten
tion is competent, then a commission
er will be appointed to take evidence
and report to the court.
The court will certainly find some
way to see that justice is meted out
to all parties, and if it does, Bradley
will get the office, as all must admit
that but for an inexcusable blunder
on the part of the county clerk of
Maries county, his election would not
be questioned) and it is bard to con
ceive of a man holding such au im
portant office contrary to the will of
the voters of the district, as would
be the case should Judge Cox be al
lowed to assume the position.

A New Back for an Old One. How it can
be Done in Ironton.
The back aches at times with a dull,
indescribable feeling, making you
weary and restless; piercing pains
shoot across the region of the kid
neys, and again the loins are so lame
that to stoop is agony. No use to rub
or apply a plaster to the back if the
kidneys are weak. You cannot reach
the cause Ironton residents would
do well to profit by the following ex
ample: F. Bradford, carpenter, Federal
Hill, Flat River, Mo., says: "My
kidneys were out of order and I
couldn't stoop or bend over. My
kidneys ncted irregularly and the kid
ney secretions were unnatural. I
bought Doan's Kidney Pills and used
them as directed. They rid me of the
backaches and put my kidneys in
good order."

$25,000 Firet Bonne Terre.
(Flat River News.)
A fire entailing an estimated loss of
about $25,000 occurred at Bonne Terre
Sunday morning. The fire, which is
supposed to be of incendiary origin,
started in a room occupied by M.
Cohen as a dry goods store. Cohen is
suspected of being responsible for the
fire. A warrant charging him with
arson was sworn out for his arrest by
S. A. Holdman. Cohen was placed
under arrest and lodged in jail at
Farmington.
Cohen conducted his business under
the name of the Peoples Bargain
Store. He has been in the Lead Beit
a little more than a year. For several
months last winter he conducted a
store in Flat.River, near Squire Mar
tin's office. He bears an unsavory
reputation. This was probably re
sponsible for his arrest as the charge
that he set fire to bis stock does not
seem to be well founded by reason of
the fact that he carried no insurance.
He had made several efforts to obtain
insurance but' had been refused by
Bonne Terre agents. His store had
been on fire at least twice before the
Sunday fire. On both occasions the
fire is alleged to have originated from
an oil stove which he used for cooking
purposes In the rear of his store.
Before the fire Sunday was gotten
under oontrol the Brokenshire build
ing was destroyed, the Wells Mercan
tile Company had partly burned, a
hole had been burned Iu the roof of
the C. W. Ward store building adjoin
ing and several buildings across the
street had been scorched and the
glass plate in the store fronts ruined
by the heat.
