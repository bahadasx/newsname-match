'Court Contracts for Roads.
'.The Powell Fiscal Court met
atStanton Monday and let the
contract for building 12 miles of
earth road to Harris A; Meyers,
of. -Covington, for $2,208 00 per
nfile.r Six miles of this road
runs from the city limits df Clay
City to -Lulbegrud, the Clark
county line, and the remainder
rtins from Welch's Crossing east
of Stanton to a point near Bowon
The basis cost which runs the
price up to the $2,208, per mile,
is as follows
Removing trees over 12 inches
in diameter, $1:00 each;
Clearing and grubbing, 860.00
per acre:
Earth excavation, '80 cents per
cubic yard ;
Rock excavation, $1.00 per cu
bic yard ;
Hauling and laving galvanized
iron pipe, which the county 'must
furnish extra,
" 12 inch pipe, 00 cents per ft.
18 " " 80 " " "
24 " " 00 " " "
Concrete work, Class A. $10.00
per cubic yard y
Steel reinforcing, 6 cents per
pound;
Crowning and shaping road,
$100.00 per mile.
The above cost does not in
clude the galvanized culvert pipe
which will probably cost $100
per mile more, nor does tho above
inclu.de the cost of surveys al
ready made, nor the cost oLan

surveying has to data cost ap
proximately $100 per mile, and
the cost nf the court und the in
spector will amount to no less
tliHii J100 more per mile, which
will bring the total cost of im
proved dirr rouil understate aid
plan to 12,500 per mile, it seems.
'Squire John A. Sowell refused
to concur in the action of the
court, and voted against letting
the contract at such an exorbitant-
figure.
Death of Rev. W. H. Childers.
-
'All the older people of this
portion of Powell and part of Es
till, well remember the Rev. W.
H. Childers, who served as pas
tor of the M. E. churches in this
section in 1878, and they will re
gret to learn of his death, which
we learn from the Barbourville
Advocate as follows:
"We have just received word
tliat Rev. W. II. Childers, who
once lived l. ere and who was once
the presiding elder, of the Metho
dist Episcopal Church, died at the
home of his daughter in Ohio.
Re". Childers was a fine pieach
er and was one of the "Boys" in
1801 that volunteered to held to
keep MOld Glory" in the air, and
the whole United8tates on the
map of the world. We are sure
that he received that plaudit
,lWfll done thou good and faith
ful Servant."

Hazard Hard Hit, Too,
The Hazard Herald has seen
the inevitable on account of in
creased cost Of paper and has put'
its fJrice up. To its subscribers
it explains the situation as fol
lows: "January 1st of this year we
were paying $2.50 per hundred
for the paper that the Herald is
printed on, and now we are pay
ing $10.00 per hundred for the
same amount of paper, four times
as much. It is not good business
to do business at a great loss, so
we are compelled by circum
stances to raise the subscription
ptice of the Herald to $1.50 per
year. We hope our subscribers
will see the justice of this and
continue to give us your patron
age'." What's the matter with the
Herald is the matter -with every
other small paper in the country
No Hope for Powell.
The Richmond 'Climax has be

our hopes of going that way with

OUR SUBSCRIBERS-
Every item.fwt goes' into the makeup of The Times has more than doubled
p cost in (Miaat few years. In addition to this all forms of living expens
es nave alsyaiiariy doubled. These conditions make an increase in our
rates for botf.tubscripbon and advertising absolutely necessary to enable us
to exist wWWt a loss. If every subscriber should pay cash at the old rate
of subulpliy based on the present cost of producing the paper, we would
lose $166, fWf year, and our time in getting it out To overcome this loss
we have rafced the subscription price of the paper to ONE DOLLAR
per year", a3jr no subscriptions after Jan. I, 191 7 will be received for less
than that amint. But in order to equalize matters as much as possible.we
will accept Inscriptions to The Times at 75 cents per year until Jan. I st.
If you dakma save 25 cents on your 1917 subscription, see that the pa
per is paid Br before-Jan. I st, as positively after that date no subscriptions
will be received (or less than one dollar per year. Until Jan. 1 st, 75 cents.
