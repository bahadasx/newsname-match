City Hall Notes
A controversy arising from the ruins
of Cook's hospital seems doomed to
iast for several weeks al?out the cityhall.
Dominick Castalucri. the foreman
of the water department, who
takes life very seriously, resents the
statement that the water plugs at the
tire at Cook's hospital were frozen. He
states that such was not the case and
that whoever said so is a damma lire.
The gentlemen at the city hall have
been complainiug ot writers cramp
and it is al! due to the fact that they
have been sending out too many Christmas
greeting cards. David Deane is
assisting the commissioners in getting
their mail matter addressed.
The hose used in fighting the fire a:
Cook's hospital is getting dried out so
that It will soon be of some use. Every
foot of hose worth while was used in
the fire. Altogether 2.309 feet was nee
essary. The department wiil purchase
some new hose shortly.

INJURED IN FALL
Drops Eighteen Feet W"hen
Hospital Roof Gives
Away.
Freeman Kelley. aged ;> fell
through the charred root of 1 ook hospitai
an J -a as probably fatally injure!
shortly before one o'clock this afternoon
Mr. Kelley. who is the father
of J. Ebert Kelley, engaged in the insurance
business in Fairmont was removing
some debris from the roof v. hen
suddenly the root, supported only by
chirred timbers, gave way and precipitated
him to the floor below. A
deep cut was made over the nght eye.
causing concussion of the brain it is
feared. At press time Mr. Kelley was
1 still unconscious.
Mr Kelley had been employed by
Hotb-rt and ispeddon in the work of
i "building the hospital and had been
. ; ?'-rk but a few hours when the acci lent
occurred. Whether or not the injuries
are tatal can not be told defi:
itcly until a reaction sets in Because
of Mr Kelley's age the hopes for his
recovery are slim.
The floor gave way without a moment's
warning and threw Mr. Kelley
a disance of about eighteen feci. He
was immediately taken up by men who
were working near bim and carried
into the hospital dormitory where his
wound was dressed by Dr. d'tickl-r
He will be cared for in the dormitory.
