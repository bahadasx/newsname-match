RAILROAD
IS NEEDED
From Tampa to Miami By Way
of Punta Gorda
BEST ROUTE FOR IT
Outlined by J. R. Doty of LaBelle,
in a Letter to Secretary Dickie
Tampa Board of Trade
.Recently, a party of Nc-.v York
capitalists headed by Charles R.
Baker came to Tampa and made
, trip from there to Miami. They
went via Fort Myers, up the Ca
. V loossahatchee river . and across
s Lake Okeechobee. They were
v prospecting for a railway across
this lower end of the peninsula, a
a railway that is greatly needed
and if constructed, will prove a
v profitable investment. At LaBelle
they met J. R. Doty, a well inform
i ed gentleman whose knowledge of
the country enabled him to dess
ignate for the proposed railway
that route that presents "all the ad
vantages that may be desired...
Mr. Doty reports that the gen
tlemen were favorably impressed
with the country ; wherefore, in a
letter to Secretary Dickie of the
'Tampa Board of Trade, he urges
the people all along the line of
' the proposed road to make an or-
1 1 gamzed and persistent ettort to m
ii i$terest capital in building it. His
'! 4' 'suggestion should receive prompt
I.'' i-'jand earnest attention, and, to this
"nd, we print his letter in full.
"ilt is dated at LaBelle, Dec. 8th,
jl find is as follows:
I Dear Sir: In behalf of the La-
) "Belle league, permit me to thank
? -'you and the Tampa Board of
jj frade for your interest in our del
- egate sent over to meet Mr. Baker
1 L fand his party.

with the possibilities of this val
ley. It seems to be the general opin
ion that a railroad connecting
Tampa and Miami would fill in the
missing link that has been a draw
back to the development of this
country.
There are thousands of tourists
every year that visit the cast and
west coasts of Florida that would
lie only too glad to cross the state
and make the return trip via an
other line if they but had the op
portunity. There is also a continual stream
of travel through the canals, Lake
Okeechobee and down the river,
that is clamoring for swifter and
better transportation facilities.
While it is not for us to select
routes for railroads, yet the peo
ple who live here have first hand
knowledge of the necessities and
also of the possibilities of making
a road pay through this or that
particular community.
If the people all along the line
will concentrate their efforts and
be united in their requests, no
doubt better results can be obtain
ed. It appears to me that a road
connecting with the Seaboard Air
Line at Venice and crossing the
river somewhere near Punta Gor
da, then dropping down near the
Caloosahatchee fifteen or twenty
miles west of here, supplying the
towns along this river, touching
along the lake and then to Miami,
would be a hummer and would
link us all up together in a man
ner that would be most profitable
to us all.
Let me have your views along
the lines indicated and let us see
if we cannot organize the forces
along soma lines whereby we can
all work together.
Very truly yours
J. R. Doty,
Chairman Executive Committee.
Houses have never succeeded in
getting on the appropriation of
$50,000.
In the House, theother day, a
bill was passed appropriating the
sum of $50,000 for a fish hatchery
in this state, the site to be selected
by the Commissioner of Fisheries.
It is hoped that the Florida bena-
tors will succeed m having thi;
measure put through the upper
branch before adjournment so that
the state may secure the fish-
hatcherv that has long been
sought for. Florida has been en
deavoring for many years to se
cure action in both Houses during
the same session. It is to be hop
ed that the present Congress, in
spite of its briefness, will settle
the matter once and for all. The
question of. the site is left in the
hands of federal authorities, and
that ought to eliminate any delays
after the passage of the measure.

Out of 330,179 school children
examined in the city of New York
in 1914, 194,247, or 58.8 per cent
suffered from defective teeth.
This exceeded the sum total of all
the others defects noted by nearly
80,000: Defective teeth impair
general health and impede school
progress. Disorders of the diges
tive tract, tuberculosis and various
other diseases frequently are pre
ceded by diseased conditions in the

There is a direct relationship
between dental development and
mental development, and it is cb
solutely essential good work in
schools that children s teeth be
maintained in a healthy condition.

Christmas now be merry. In England, tho land from
which our Christmas greeting came, those words will
very likely not be heard at all. In France the "
phrase "Joyeux Noel", if it is uttered, will be a

' Winter-grown Irish potatoes
are more profitable, to the farmer
of Florida than the fall-crown
crop. It is the early potato that
finds a ready market both at home
and in the North and it can be
marketed before it reaches matur
ity. Florida-grown seed has not
proved satisfactory in past sea
sons, says A. P. Spencer, district
agent of farmers' cooperative
demonstration work to the Uni
versity of Florida, who recom
mends, that . growers follow the
usual custom of buying northern-
grown seed.
Mr. Spencer also recommends
growing of a larger acreage of
winter potatoes. The flatwoods
sections where artesian irrigation
is possible are well adapted to this
crop if proper means for drainage
are provided.- These soils contain
much humus ai:d can be brought
to a high statv of cultivation by
systematic crop rotation. Make
the potato beds from 12 to 15 in
ches high, and with ditchs at the
end3 of the rows, sufficient drain

had. " ',
Potatoes may be planted "in
South Florida in January, or even
in December, with comparative
safety from killing frosts, ,but in

"The first really bad road we

villages are entering a competition
to sec who will sell the most seals
per capita for the prevention of
tuberculosis' in their communities.
Over 300,000,000 seals have been
distributed for the sale.
The cities, towns and villages
have been divided into 10 classes
according to population ranging
from 600 to 1,000,000 and over.
Pennants will be awarded by the
American Red Cross and The Na
tional Association for the Study
and Prevention of Tuberculosis in
each of these classes. Similar r n
nanfs will be awarded tc state
ling the most seals per inhabitant,
the states being divided into three
classes according to populaton.
Last year Ilershey, Pa., sold
more seals per capita than any
other town or city in the United
States, reaching a total of, 2D.04
