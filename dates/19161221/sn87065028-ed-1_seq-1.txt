PREMIER LLOYD-GEORGE
MAKES OFFICIAL AN-NOUNCEMENT.
TO PROSECUTE WAR
WITH MORE VIGOR
Action Occasioned No Surprise
Either in This Country or in
Germany.
London,, Dec. 20. Germany's
peace proposals have been rejected
by Great Britain in an announce
ment in the house of commons. Pre
mier Lloyd-George said England de
clined to enter into peace negotia
tions with the German allies. The
war will go on.
The new government, headed by
Lloyd-George, is determined to prose
cute the war more vigorously than
ever. .
In making his announcement the
premier said:
"England does not intend to put
her head into a noose the lines of
which are in Germany's hands. Ger
many could control the lines and
choke her to death."
England is going to stand with her
allies. There is going to be no break
in the solidity of the entente so far
as England is concerned.
England's answer will be given in
decisive terms in full accord with
the replies of France and Russia.
The premier declared that peace
without reparation for the past is im
possible. The German offer in the
form in which it comes cannot be ac
cepted, the premier said. He added
it would be possible to enter . into
peace negotiations only if Germany
accede to conditions under which the
future peace of the world is assured.
Among the spectators were many
.MplfljnaA from twJtrV. st?., who
dung with breathless interest ' to
every word the premier uttered. The
chamber was crammed to its capac
ity with legislators, officers of state
and spectators, who breathlessly
hung on the momentous words of the
premier-minister. Premier Lloyd
George arrived at 4:05 p. m., and
was wildly cheered. It was his first
appearance since he assumed his du
ties as premier.
Amsterdam, Dec. 20. London
messages stating that the German
peace note had been handed to the
British foreign office without com
ment from President Wilson caused
disappointment from Berlin, said a
message from the German capital.
There had been hopes that the presi
dent would make some suggestion ;o
the entente governments, particular
ly England, indicating a desire of
neutrals for peace, the message de
clared. German newspapers have warned
the people not to be. too optimistic.
The numerous friends of Mrs. II.
J. Dashiell are, pained to hear of her
.serious illness the past several days.
MERCHANDISE IS STOLEN
FROM THE SOUTHERN CAFE
THIEVES GET SEVERAL BOXES
OF CIGARS AND OTHER AR
TICLES FROM STOCK.
Some dishonest, worshiper at the
shrine of Lady Nicotine, doubtless be
ing without fund's and still deter
mined to have a plentiful supply of
Christmas smokes, on last Monday
night surreptitiously entered the Sou
thern Cafe.which is located just south
of the Southern Railway passenger
(Station, and stole therefrom several
boxes of cigars and other merchan
dise, the total value of the loot be
ing estimated at about $25.
It seems that the front door had
not been securely fastened and that
entrnace to the building was there
fore gained without difficulty. Police
are investigating the robbery, but a3
yet have secured no clew as to the
identity of the thief.
An appropriation of 14,250,000 for
dependentfami'ies of militiamen on
the Mexican border is included in the
urgent deficiency bill, reported in the
House of Representatives. Provision
also is made for $210,000 for the

in demand.
BIG OIL WELL BROUGHT IN
NEAR ALABAMA TOWN
ON TUESDAY.
EXCITEMENT SAID
PREVAIL THERE
Well Has Capacity of About
One Hundred and Fifty Bar
rels of Oil Daily.
According to advices received here
yesterday, oil has been struck at Cor
dova, Ala., a gusher with a capacity
of about one hundred and fifty bar
reis cany navmg Teen brought in
there Tuesday afternoon.
The announcement occasioned no
surprise, as it has been thought for a
long time past that there was a stra
tum of oil in that vicinity. It will
be remembered that natural gas was
discovered near Fayette, Ala., about
six years ago, and as gas and oil are
generally found pretty close together
geologists predicted at the time that
oil would sooner or later be4 discov
ered in the same territory.
Soon after natural gas was dis
covered at Fayette a company was
formed to develop the property, and
thousands of dollars' worth of stock
was sold in this, city. The company
had on foot a scheme to build a pipe
line to Columbus, and assured local
manufacturers that they could fur
nish them fuel for much less than
they were paying for coal. The
scheme petered out, however, and
those , ho purchased stock lost prac
tically all the money that they in
vested. It is understood that the well which
was brought in Tuesday is owned
by an Oklahoma concern, which be
came convinced some time ago that
ft(s !! nist Cordova, -fid 'be
gan an enort to locate tne strata.
This effort has proven successful, but
the full value of the property is yet
to be determined, as some wells flow
freely for a ; hort time, , and then
suddenly stop. Both the owners of
the well and residents of Cordova be
lieve, however, that the flow will con
tinue and are even hopeful that ad
ditional wells will be brought in in
the near future.
Cordova, which is about eighty
miles northeast of Columbus, is al
ready a prosperous town. The Sou
thern and Frisco roads cross there,
and the town is the home of the In
dian Head Mills, one of the largest
plants in this section devoted to the
manufacture of cotton goods. It is
also the head of navigation on the
Warrior river, recent improvements
by the Federal government having
made it possible for steamboats to
reach that point.
The oil well is located on the prop
erty of the Pratt Consolidated Com
pany which maintains headquarters
in Birmingham, but the drillers were
operating for a Tulsa, Oklahoma,
company, of which former Governor
Charles N. Haskell of Oklahoma is
the head.
Erskine Ramsey, vice-president and
chief engineer of the Pratt Consoli
dated Company, on Tuesday night
gave the Birmingham Age-Herald the
following interview regarding the
well:
"Our information is that the dril-
ers struck oil at a depth of about 800
feet," said Mr. Ramsey. "They were
drilling about a quarter of a mile
from the river and before they could
get the flow under control, the stream
of oil ran down into the Warrior
river. It had already riowed over tne
whole premises where the drillers
worked.
"We understand tonight that the
men drilled into the oil-bearing sand
only about 12 inches and they esti
mated the flow already at something
like 150 barrels a day. The drillers
state that it is the best well they ever
saw in all hteir experience.
"They state that the oil is the high
est grade green oil and that it prom
ises to be a very valuable asset.
"The Oklahoma company, under
which the drillers are working,, is
headed by former Gov. Charles N.
Haskell of that state. They leased
some property from us several
months ago and began their drilling
operations. Our company made the
lease with Governor Haskell whereby
we are to get royalties on whatever
success they had.
"The most encouraging thing about
the whole affair from the Alabama
standpoint is the fact that the oil
is located on the river and liutl il i
of such high grade. As js well known,

SLAYER RECOVERS FROM STU

BROWN RECOVERING.
Aberdeen, Miss., Dec. L'0. Will.
LoU, who was shot by Clifford Tyler,
a 15-year-old boy of Amory, Mis.,
last Su iday, died yesterday morning
at 9:55 o'clock at the;City Hospital,
Amory, Miss.
Miss Minnie Brown, the pretty 16-year-old
girl, who wa;; shot three
times by young Tyler, is slov iy im
proving, and unless some unlookcd
for complication arises she will fully
recover, her physician says.
Two of the bullets, .38-ca'il re,
steel jackets, are lodged in tho neck
aud will not be removed until she is
recovered.
Clifford Tyler is entirely al'him
self, and when the warrant was
served on him yesterday afternoon
in the Monroe county jail, charging
him with the murder of Will Lot.,
he broke down and cried.
Hon. D. W. Houston and I). W.
Houston, Jr., have been employed by
the boy's father to defend him. Al
though his lawyers will not allow him
to make a statement, it is rumored
thai his defense will be that Lotz
gave him a drug. He says Will Lotz
told him to get his father's pistol and
meet him at Gilmore & Puckett's
sawmill, on the Frisco railroad, and
that they would come over to Aber
deen and get Minnie Brown and go
out ridmg. The reason for Lotz ask-
him to pet the Kun he wa8
thnt the Aberdeen fellows were
rough lot and he would need it.
They came to Aberdeen and before
goini; for the young lady stopped at
a cafe and got a soft drink. They
then went for the girl. Soon he be
came drowsy and could not remem
ber very much about the shooting, he
says.
Miss Brown's statement is that they
had beed" riding several miles and
neither of them had spoken. Then
Tyler said: "Minnie, you don't love
me, do you?" and she said: "No; I
don't love anyone."
He then pulled his pistol, she says,
and be..an firing. The first shot
struck Lot, in the face, and the next
three struck her. They got out of the
car then and she started toward Ty
ler, who told her that if she came any
nearer he would kill her.
v Lotz told several persons on the
afternoon he wal shot that he heard
a noise and looked back, thinking he
hol had a blowout, and the boy shot
him in the face.
Another report says that Lotz said
the boy ordered him to stop the car,
that he and the girl might get out,
and that Lotz told Tyler that he
would not do anything like that, and
the boy opened fire.
Tyler will be given a preliminary
hearing as soon as Miss Drown, is able
to testify. He will be prosecuted by
G. M. Holmes, county attorney.
Will Lotz was buried from his late
residence this morning at 10:30
o'clock, Rev. L. A, Cunningham, pas
tor of the Christian church, officiat
