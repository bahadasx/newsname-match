NUMBER 273
PRESIDENT 111 BiB
INTO NATIONAL GAMPS
ITALIAN 'TROOPS ENTRENCHING ON THE CARSO
In Transmitting Germany's Peace Proposal to
Belligerent Nations Also Asked Them for a
Discussion of Peace Terms Action Was Sur
prise to Foreign Diplomats in Washington and
the Comments Were Varied.
Washington, I). C, Dec. 21. Sur
prise was apparent among diplomatic
offlclula here over President WIIhoo'b
pica to European belligerents to dls
cum peace tenni. The goneral opin
ion was that President Wilson's ac
tion would gl encouragement to
some aort of exchange of views which
might result In a discussion of defi
nite peace terma between the bellig
erents. Despite the fact that President Wil
son's note statea specifically that he
is "not proposing peace and that he
la not even offering mediation," tbey
re regarded here as of such nature
as will compel the belligerents to
make more of a reply than a mere ac
knowledgment of receipt.
Diplomats think It incredible that
President Wilson should have taken
this action without some belief that it
would not be flatly rejected without
consideration by the entente allies,
The wish and hope of the German al
lies that he take some such step has
long been well known, and there Is no
doubt of the tuaoner ot its reception
among them. Officials and diplomats
here, analyzing the President's note,
are finding something deeper than an
appeal for peace terms. They see
that the President Is not acting, but
also was considering what would have
to be the course of the I'nlted States
the fighting nations being apparently
wlRh to protect themselves and the
rest of the world against future wars,
an understanding Is not wholly Impossible.
Received In London.
London, Dec. 21. The suggestion of
the I'nlted States for an exchange of
views among the belligerents was re
ceived at the foreign office today and
Is now under consideration, pending
which no statement will be made.

EXAMINING TRIAL
WHITE GIFT SERVICE.
Happy and Helpful Service at Presby
terian Church.
Notwithstanding the cutting norther
that blew up yesterday afternoon, a
large crowd was present at the First
Presbyterian church last night for the
"White Gift" service. The audience
was composed largely of children, as
the greater part of the gifts were to
come from them, and in the main
they were to render the splendid pro
gram aa published In the Eagle a few
days ago. Every number of the pro
gram was enjoyed and those taking
part not only acquitted themselves
with credit, but added materially to
the pleasures of the occasion.
Many gifts were brought by the
children and these were packed to be
