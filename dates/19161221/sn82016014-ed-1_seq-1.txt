President's 3Ioe.
Washington, Dec. 21. Plainly hint
In" that there is danfier of the United
Stales being drawn into the war, Sec
retary of State Lansing today said
this was the real reason behind Pres
ident Wilson's message to the belliger-
The sn'uation of the United States,
as a neutral is rapidly becoming ln
toleralile he said. Therefore the
president' had demanded a show
down. , . ,
"Our rights have been invaded and
the situation is becoming so intoler
able that it cannot go on longer," de
clared th secretary of state.
More and more our rights are in
vaded bv the belligerents on both
sides so that the situation is becoming
increasingly critical. I learn by that
that we are drawing nearer to the
verge of war and therefore are en
titled to know what each belligerent
seeks in order that we can regulate
our conduct in the future.
It was not our ..ma-terialInterests
that were ' considered when he said
that the situation might become, in
tolerable. We have prospered by the
war. but our rights have been in
vaded." Not a Peace Move at AH.
Lansing emphasized positively that
the Herman peace proposal and the
Lloyd -deorge speech had nothing to
do with the dispatch of the Wilson
note except possibly to delay sending
On this point he authorized quota
tion as follows:
"No nation has been sounded on this
matter and we did not know in ad
vance what Lloyd-George would say.
Ami there was no consideration of
r.erman overtures or the speech of
Lloyd -George in connection with for
mation of this note.
"The only thing the German over
tures did was possibly to delay the
note a few days.
It was not finally decided to send
this until Monday. (The note was sent
Mondav night and Tuesday morning)
The difficulty that faced the president
was that the note might be construed
as a movement for peace, and in aid
of the German overtures. He specifi
cally denies that that was a factor in
the communication itself."
Previous to authorizing the above
quoted statement Lansing had talked
more freely than usual and in the
same tenor.
Danger of Y. S. Iieing Drawn In.
It has been suggested to him that
the United States really was in no
position to stop the war unless the
belligerents themselves desired to end
it: to this he hinted that if the United
States were to enter the war it would
turn the scale definitely and he em
phasized that there was a feeling of
danger that the country would be
drawn in.
He had also paid that tnere was in
the administration's mind no purpose
to suggest peace in any way.
on the contrary he explained that
what had been generally interpreted
as a desire to learn the peace terms of
both sides was in reality an effort to
asc ertain "what would satisfy the bel
ligerents as to ending the war," but
witli the viewpoint of rendering the
position of neutrals less intolerable.
Lansing's whole talk emphasized the
idea that "we will have to do some
thing," if Anjerican rights are further
invaded and if both sides continue in
fractions of international law which
involve American lives, property and
rights.
lias Dusking of Neutrals.
Washington, Dec. 21. In making
his first formal effort to get a state
ment of peace terms from the bel
ligerent powers and to evolve from the
European war means of preventing a
similar world tragedy. President Wil
son acted with knowledge that the
other world neutral? would stand be
hind him, it was stated today.
He has the greatest confidence that
his efforts will succeed.
Official and diplomatic Washington
todav scarcely recovered from the
Ftartling development of his sending a
peace note to ali countries, awaited
with anxiety the first response from
t ing(rent nation? to tne presiaent s
suggestion for peace definitions.
The president's action came out of
a clear sky. He explained this coun
try's "intimate interest" in the war's
conclusion thus:
Reasons for Mediation.
"Lest it should presently be too
late to accomplish the greater things
which lie beyond its conclusion.
"Lest the situation of neutral na
tions, now exceedingly hard to en
dure, be rendered altogether intoler
able. And,
"Lest an injury be done civiliza
tion itself which can never be atoned
for or repaired."
The president has made it clear

Chicago, Dec. 21. Twenty-four

Determination to launch his pro

altho he had contemplated such action
for several weeks.
The change in the announced policy
of this government to merely act as
messenger for the belligerent powers
remained an enigma today, but it is
assumed the president received assurances-such
an "entering wedge" pro
posal would not be received in an un

Anti-War Council Sounds Out Bellig
erents by Sending Notes.
The Hague, Dec. 21. The peace
resolution adopted by the Netherlands
anti-war council and which has been
sent to all the belligerent governments
declares that the chief war aim of alt
the fighting nations being apparently
a wish to protect themselves and the
rest of the world against future wars,
an understanding is not wholly im
possible. It calls attention to the fact
that the leading statesmen of Bri
tain, France and Germany have re
peatedly avowed a willingness to join
an international peace league and
that thus a safeguard is obtainable
that right instead of might may gov
ern international reactions in the fu
ture and Europe be delivered from
militarism.
'"VVe beseech the belligerent gov
ernments and peoples," the resolution
says, "to make at least an endeavor
to discover whether an agreement is
possible now with a view to tne es
tablishment of a just and durable
peace and a free Europe."
The meeting of the council at which
the resolution was passed was attend
ed by many members of parliament,
university professors and representa
tives of peace organizations.

Determined to Carry on War.
Berlin, Dec. 21. The German pub
lic is determined to carry on the war,
in view of Premier Lloyd-George's
speech. Utterances of the British
nrime minister have been examined
alike by the humblest citizen and the
highest official from tne grand neaa
quarters to Potsdam. The general
public's verdict is the same. The of
ficial viewpoint will not be made
known, in all probability, until the re
ceipt of the official text of the allies'
reply.
Even the Socialist leader. Dr.
Scheidemann, declares if Lloyd
George expects Germany to publish
her peace conditions as the next step
he will be disappointed. Scheide
mann also remarked incidentally that
the imperial chancellor, Von Beth-mann-Hollweg
followed Socialists
ideas, in making the proffer.

Theodore Wolff, writing in the
Tageblatt says:
"Premier Lloyd-George rejects over
tures of peace by asking Germany's
terms, knowing no belligerent can
publish its terms."
Von Rethmann-Hollweg to Handle It
London, Dec. 21. A dispatch to
Keuter's Telegram company from Zu
rich, says information has been re
ceived there from Berlin that Doctor
von Bethmann-Hollweg, the German
Imperial chancellor, in a secret con
ference with the party leaders pre
ceding his announcement of Ger
many's peace offer in the reichstag,
was given full powers to conduct
p-ace negotiations without further
consultation even with the party lead
ers. Why Fear Peace Move?
Berlin. Dec. 20. Delayed The Ber
lin, press, which commented 'only frag
mentarily on Premier Lloyd-George's
speech this morning because only ex
cerpts were available, now has the en
tire text and devotes its lull attention
to the subject. The papers on a whole
express little surprise at the British
premier's attitude, altho most wonder
why he believes1 that entering into a
conference would involve the entente

which no statement will be made.
Buenos Aires, Dec. 21. Argentine

port of such a step.
Officials were swept off their feet
with surprise at the note and formal
comment was not immediately ootain

pressed the belief that the president's
plea for a definition of the terms of
peace on both sides was most timely
and seemed to have fair prospect of
success.

New Tork. Dec. 21. Tumbling
values on the stock exchange today
pave startling examples of the ex
tent to which peace possibilities
have caused shrinkage in prices- of
the "war bridep." The first hints
of peace caused nervousness in the
"war market" and each successive
definite development has caused a
sharp break. The following table

New Tork. Dec. 21. Extreme weak
ness bordering upon demoralization
r. irked the opening dealings on the
stock exchange today. The so-called
war shares broke from 2 to 11 points
these being extended in the course of
the first ten minutes.
The most sensational feature was
the offering of 50,000 shares of TJ. S.
steel at 104 V, to 105 against yester
day's closing price of 108. Never be
fore in the history of the exchange
has a single block of such volume
been recorded.
Transactions in steel continued on
an enormous scale. Including the fifty
thousand share lot at the epening, to
tal sales in that stock amounted to
220,000 shares within the first half
hour at between 104 and 106. The
lots sold ranged from 1,000 to 6,000
shares with one lot of 15.000 shares.
Stocks which broke sharply includ

Steel, Lackawanna steel, American car.
Central leather, Pittsburgh coal and
Utah copper. The selling seemed to
come from all quarters and represent
ed further unloading of impaired
margins.
A renewal of liquidation was largely
ascribed to President Wilson's note to
the belligerent nations.

Chicago, Dec. 21. A maximum de
cline of 7 cents was registered in the
wheat market at the opening today on
President Wilson's peace message.
Wheat for May delivery closed yes
terday at $1.61 to $1.62. It opened
today with sales ranging from $1.55
to $1.58. July at $1.30 to $1.31, open

were loaded with selling orders and' a
huge business was done.
Pit Like a Football Game.
It was a stormy time in the wheat
pit during the first fifteen minutes.
The confusion was so great that fre
quent instances were witnessed where
brokers plunged thru the crowd as
if on the football field and grabbed
each other by. the shoulders to shout
in each other's faces. Buying on the
part of strong houses quickly brought
about a semblance of steadiness, how
ever, and in less than half an hour
the selling stampede appeared to be at
an end, with the market above 5 cents
under yesterday's finish.
Exporters Begin Bidding.
The upswing that followed the in
itial descent of the market -assumed
more and more impetus when traders
had gained time to breathe freely,
and signs were noticed that some of
the buying of future deliveries was
on European account and that ex
porters were- among the active bid
ders for cash wheat. At this stage
the market had climbed more than 4
cents up from the bottom level
touched at the outset.

Washington, Dec. 21. The national

MAKE BRITAIN DRY
Believe Lloyd-George Will En
force National Prohibition.
So Many Revolutionary Changes
Public Immune to Surprise.
London, Dec. 21. Within forty-
eight hours of Premier Lloyd-George's
' first speech, England has been un
' precedently awakened by the actual
: ities of war. Revolutionary changes
have come in such rapid succession
: that the public would not be surprised
at any development. If national pro
; hibition on liquor was announced this
' afternoon it would probably evoke
! nothing more than a zephyr of hos
! tility.
j Actual prohibition may not be so
remote, either, especially since it is
reported that liquor will soon be en
! tirely banned in Scotland, in order to
increase the output of shipping not
j only by permitting more work by
i shipbuilding laborers, but by decreas
i ing cargoes of booze,
t The public argues that if such a
i move would augment shipping, it
' would probably also increase the out
1 put of shells and foodstuffs in various
1 ways if applied vigorously to the en
J t'ire country.

ONE MOTHER BACKED OUT

Most of Little Patients Faced

Twelve poor children, who faced
years of suffering from bad tonsils and
adenoids, are lying in St. Francis hos
pital this afternoon free from tonsils
and adenoids and enjoying the hum
care the children of the wealthiest
parents in Topeka ould receive. Be
ginning at 7:30 o'clock this mbrnlng;
Drs. II. U Alkire. J. A. Crabb and
George II. Litjinger performed th
twelve operations, free of charge, I
three separate operating rooms at St,
Francis hospital. All the operations
proved euccessul and most of the
children will b; able to enjoy a good
Christmas dinnjr. Twelve more will
undergo operations the Tuesday after
Christ'-nas.
Seated in a room on the first floor

who had volunteered to come for pur
poses of moral support. ; '
"You can believe me," eaid the
moral support, 'that if those were my
children I'd go up in the operating
room or they wouldn't be operated -on."
Some of the women answered, oth
ers did not. Tne lone father looked
uncomfortable A visitor came down
and spoke of the excellent care and
quarters furnished the children.
The Moral Support.
"It Is no more than they should do,"
said the moral support. That ended
turth'er 'conversation among the par
ents. '
Upstairs there was a bustle in the
operating noor never before witness
ed in a Topeka hospital. Three
streltchr'".wonld be seen hurrying
down the hall with the inert bodies
jn
of three children returning from theli
operation. few minutes the
stretchers would be seen rolling down
the hall with frightened looking chil
dren on them, going to the operating
room for their operations. .
A nurse was furnished for each
child as it came out from under the
anaesthetic. In three instanres,
brothers and sisters were undergoing
operations in adjoining operating
rooms. All were mighty sick after
the operations but this afternoon the
after effects were gone and they were
well on the road to health.
Two lads, who had never seen each
other, entered a room in the hospital
Wednesday evening to prepare Tfor
their operations. Never did two
youths have the fun that these strange
lads did prior to the operation.
An hour after the operation theT
lay on the same bed, little pans held
under their chins, spitting blood and
crying as if their little hearts were
broken.
"Their fun's all over for a little
while," said a nurse. "You should
have seen them two hours ago, lying
on tne same Ded, laughing and Jok
ing." One Mother Balked.
One mother refused admittance to
the operating room while the opera
tions were in progress, demanded that
her two boys be released and dressed.
With each hand firmly grasping the
hand of each lad, the mother sailed
from the hospital, minus two free op
erations. In one instance, a mother
of two was permitted to go with one
of the lads to the operating room.
"I won't go a step without mamma.''
he told the nurses and began putting
on his clothes. So the mother was
called and accompanied the child, re
maining with him until the anaesthetic
began its work.
It is hardly probable that anyone
could criticise the specialists for not
permitting parents to be on the oper
ating floors while the operations were
in progress. .A big task faced the
nurses and doctors and there was no
room for the parents.
Sisters Enthusiastic. ,
The sisters at St. Francis hospital
are enthusiastic over the plan Initiated
by the Topeka Public Health Nursing
association. Yet. they do not wish
to be imposed on by parents who can
afford to pay for operations. Suspicion
that such might be the case was occa
sioned by the appearance of mother
with children who were better dressed
than the average housewife in To
peka. Following are the children who
underwent operations this morning.
