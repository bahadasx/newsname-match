upon request of the mayor, stated that
while he could not speak for the peo

Bingham County's Good
Roads Discussed.
Bingham County Civie league met in
regular session Thursday evening ia
the V. I. 8. rooms at the city hall. The
subject discussed at the meeting was
"Good roads." There were preeent
B. E. Salzman, representing the Bonne
ville County Good Roads association,
his stereoscopical views, and.his splen
did lecture on general and detail good
roads. Mr. Brimm, good roads worker,
gave advice backed up by years of
road building experience and log work.
The experiences of these gentlemen
were interesting in the extreme. In «
general way they advise the coun
ty of Bingham to bond and build good
roads and get their henefit now, and
to pay interest on the bonds, and main
tain such roads on the automobile li
cense, and put away a sinking fund with
the usual amount assessed for road
building.
B. W. Adair, our county attorney,
was the principal committe to report
on work assigned to him by our chair
man of the last meeting. JHis report
was an exhaustive detail of the ways
and means whereby the county can se
cure unto itself the desired good roads.
He said that it is lawful for the
county to vote bonds for any amount
it secs fit and advises that the county
commissioners arrange with some good
competent engineer and road expert
to go over our county roads and to
by
*>y
ent
to
to
of
estimate the cost of making them
"good." Upon receiving his report,
the commissioners then to call a bond
election and upon receiving a favor- in
able vote, sell sufficient amount of the
bonds to commence the work. As the
work on the roads progress, more bonds
are sold, and so on until the entire
roads of the county are made "good."
DUCK SEASON.
Last evening at sundown, closed
the last day of the open season on
ducks in Idaho for this year. It is
hoped, ere another season passes, that
the game laws will be revised and
written in such a manner th^t peo
ple at large will be able to understand
them, and lawyers able to interpret
what they mean, as the state law ean
not be correctly interpreted at the
present time by ' the courts. A num
ber of sportsment will gather in this
city and make the attempt at revision
for presentation to the next session,
and if that body does not choose to
adopt the suggestions no harm will be
done, and it won't be the first in
stance of the kind.—Pocatello Tribune.
One thing worthy of great attention
by taxpayers is the plan afforded by
state laws of doing away with the
road supervisor and doing the work
under the eyes of competent engineers
*>y contractors. We all know of the
waste of time and labor under the pres
ent law and know further that con
tractors getting the work by competi
tive bidding would save such waste.
Bingham county is- fortunate in hav
ing so much good material for road
building. All our county is more or
less good road material and gravel 1 b
to be found most everywhere. The only
thing we lack is a topping or surfac
ing material. Bannock county will have
to supply this, and by the proper moth
ods of hauling, it can be had reason
ably. The best surface material to be
had is a mixture of shale and lime
rock crushed fine and well rolled
the surface of a grave! grade.
It is the purpose of this league to
acquaint Bingham county residents of
the facts as to our needs, the way to
satisfy them, and advise and aid cur
county officials as to the desires and
requirements of the public. Our sec
retary will be pleasod to give details
of the plan to any resident upon re
quest,
This league is not a Blackfoct club,
but just what its name implies: The
Bingham County Civic league, and all
residents of the county are invited to
join the organization. We meet the
second Thursday evening of each month
in the V. I. S. rooms, Blackfoot city
hall, at a dinner, the expense of which
each member pays by paying dues, $4.50
each six months. ' > * , ,

BLACKFOOT'S HERD REST.
E. M. Kennedy, the banker-farmer
raucher of Blackfoot, is offering for
sale a fine lot of pure-bred cattle. 1 Ub
herd is recognized as one of -the best
if not the best in the state. He has
cows in the herd for which he paid
$500, and his herd and the individuals
of the herd have taken first prize
wherever shown. Stock judges and
state veterinarians pronounce the herd
as good as can be bred.
Mr. Kennedy says, "I am told by
judges of livestock, state veterinarians
and others that I have the best herd
in the west. I have several cows that
cost me $500 and more. My herd bull
weighs 2400 pouuds. I have taken all
prizes at all fairs and stock shows
where my lierai has been shown. If
there are any better Hereford cattle
than are in my herd I do not know of
it, and if l thought that there were
any better 1 would have them. The
best is none too good for Idaho, and
in offering them for sale I am giving
cattlemen a rare opportunity.—Idaho

FRANK DeKAY
JS SLATED
Frank DeKay was called to Boise
last Tuesday by Governor Alexander
and as he is a very promising appli
cant for the wardenship of the peni
tentiary, it was surmised that ere this
he has been presented with the much
eoveted and valuable political appoint
ment.
Frank E. DeKay, former sheriff of
Bingham county, and T. .1. Strcud, pree
ent sheriff of Lemhi county, may be
appointed warden and deputy warden
respectively when the new state board
of prison commissoners—the gov-,
euor, attorney general and secretary
of state—take office. While no an
nouncement has been made as to what
Democrats will draw these two*plumbs,
it was said that these two men havo
"a place in the sun" and stand an ex
cellent chance securing the appoint
ments. It is equally true that the
' ' dope ' ' may be all switched at the last
moment.
In view of the fact that Warden
Snook's term expires with the ushering
out of the new year it is said to be
necessary that his successor be named
prior to that time. The state hoard of
parole is in session this afternoon and
as the same board constitutes the pris
on commission, Warden Snook may de
cide to submit his resignation, effective
on and after the close of his term, or
the appointment and qualification of
his successor.—Capital News.

"The Pennant'' last Monday evening.
More than <U) voices were heard in the
chorus. Ora Rogers, Loraine Tavey,

rey and Merrill Boyle took the lend

Successful Blackfoot Brooder.
Blackfoot is becoming famous in
Idaho and other states for the breed
ing of Hereford nnd Short Horn reg
istered thoroughbred cattle. Last week
Carl F. Lenz of Squirrel, Idaho, and Otto
Sturm of Ashton, Idaho, visited Black
foot in quest of the best bred stock
obtainable. Both of these gentlemen
are breeders of pure bred Hereford
stock and have, visited several fares
and herds to get just what they wanted
but failed to do so until they visited
Blackfoot and the famous Kennedy
stock farm. After consulting with Mr.
E. M. Kennedy and purchasing two
choice Hereford bulls, they insisted that
he had the best stock they had yet
found. When such stock judges as
these visit Blackfoot and are so well
pleased it is a compliment not only
to Mr. Kennedy's herd but to the city
that is is hound to give advertising
that will be very valuable in attract
ing other stock breeders.
