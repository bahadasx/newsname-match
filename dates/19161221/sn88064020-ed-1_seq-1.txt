SANTA CLAUS ought to
be a good Judge of foot
wear-he's been buying
shoes for years. He will buy
several hundred pair here
during the holiday season for
the folks who appreciate a
gift to their wardrobe and,
by the way, that's the most
sensible thing to give a per
son you are fond of. Instead
of some gilded knle-knae that
gathers dust on the shelf
buy them a Merry Christmas
order for a pair of shoes.
