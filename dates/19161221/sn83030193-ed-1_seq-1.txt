NATION'S RIGHTS

i THIS CANNOT GO ON
"Possibility of Our Being Forced Into
War Ought to Serve as a Re
straining and Sobering Force,"
Says Mr. Lansing.
(Wc Are Entitled to Know Exactly
What Each Belligerent Seeks in
Order to Regulate Our " Conduct
in the Future."
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. Ambassadors and Ministers from
Great Britain, Prance, Germany, Italy, Russia, Japan, Bulgaria and
Turkey called on Secretary Lansing to-day and discussed the note for
warded to the warring powers at the direction of President Wilson. Mr.
Lansing explained to them the purpose of the note.
Lansing delivered a printed copy of the note to each of the dip
lomats, but, as far as was learned, did not give them the explanation of
its Intent that he gave to the pres.
Secretary Lansing authorized fne following statement to the public:
"Our rights have been invaded and the situation
is becoming so intolerable that it cannot go on long.
"More and more our rights are involved by the
belligerents on both sides, so that the situation is be
coming increasingly critical. I mean by that that we
are drawing nearer to the verge of war, and therefore
are entitled to know what each belligerent seeks, in
order that we can regulate our conduct in the future.
NOT LOOKING AT MATERIAL INTERESTS.
"It was not our material interests that were con
sidered when we said that the situation might become
intolerable. We have prospered by the war, but our
rights have been invaded.
"No nation has been sounded on this matter, and
we did not know in advance what Lloyd George would
any. There was no consideration of German overtures
or the speech of Lloyd George in connection with for
mation of this note.
"The only thing the German overtures did was
possibly to delay the note a few days.
"It was not finally decided to send this note until
Monday. The difficulty that faced the President was
that the note might be construed as a movement for
peace, and in aid of the German overtures. He specifi
cally denies that that was n factor in the communica
tion itself."
NOT A PEACE NOTE, SAYS LANSING.
"The sending of this note will indicate the possi
bility of our being forced into the war. That possibility
j ought to serve as a restraining and sobering force,
safeguarding American rights. It may also serve to
force an earlier conclusion of the war. Neither the
' President nor myself regard this note as a peace note,
j It is merely an effort to get the belligerents to define
I the end for which they are fighting."
; Shortly after 2 o'clock this afternoon President Wilson sent for
1 Secretary Lansing.' When he left the White House the Secretary of
iStite said he might have a statement later in the day. Such a state
ment, it is believed, will explain and amplify his earlier statement and
convey an official interpretation of his remarks.
President Wilson himself on several occasions has pointed out ths
