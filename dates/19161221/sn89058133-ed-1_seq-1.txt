Q-
SCRAPS. OF VERSE AND PROSE
v ' By Clara Cox Epperson. '
" The Mothers.
The eoldiers In companies were pass
ing through our town,
With strains of martial music they
- were marching up and down;
But in my heart I found no enthusi-
astic Joy, '
lr thinking of the mother who must
give up each boy. .
The broken-hearted mothers who are
left with heads bowed low,
Who hare so little courage to meet
this bitter blow;
-He was a babe but yesterday." you
. hear them sob and cry,
Oh, Lord, why not in mercy let this
' , cup pasa us by." .
Bat there comes no word of comfort
- to ease the aching heart.
Like thousands of other mothers
they from their boys must part;
Must give them to their country.
Whate'er. their own needs be,
Must kiss and bless and let them go
to v death or victory..
But one looks down in sympathy;
'tis she who also gave
Her beloved on the cruel cross a
sin-curst world to save;
For all these weeping mothers whose
broken hearts do bleed,
Mary, the mother Holy, will surely
intercede. - .
Another Christmas nearing and war
and bloodshed still raging; boys and
men still daily blotted out of exist
ence as if they were no more than
the flies on the wall; mothers, wives
and sisters still broken-hearted, be
reft and desolate; land and countries
beautiful still dally pillaged, laid
waste, destroyed. How can the world
sing with Joy, "Peace on earth, good
will to men," this ChriatmaB time,
when there is bo much horror, blood
shed and all things diametrically op
posite to peace and good will. In the
world , with seemingly no nnu yun
erful enough to stay the carnage and
slaughter. Let us pray that God, the
Father, will put to flight the armies,
will still the sounds of war; will heal
the broken-hearted, and restore the
ruined countries, for the sake of
Christ the Son, who died to save the
world, and to establish peace and
good will among men. . .
y ' No s Room In The Inn.
No room for Him in the Inn;
No room for Him in the dust and din
Of the battlefields and the trench-

Nor in the hearts of the weary me

Find never a place to sleep
-.-No- room for the balm of His

And the peace' of our Lord's first

the needy, the afflicted are needing
wim and needinsr you. "I was slok
and ye visited me not; I was hungry
' and ye fed me not." Through minis
tering unto these, "the least of my
little ones," .you can show Him in
our hearts and lives, and take Him

" A Christmas Carol.
Scrooge was better than his word.
He did it all and infinitely more.
. . .. He became aa good a friend,
as good a master, and as good a man
as the good old city knew, or any oth
er good old city, town, or borough, in
the good old world. Some people
laughed to see the alteration in him.
but he let them laugh, and little heed
ed them; for be was wise enough to
know that nothing ever happened on
this globe, for good, at which some
people did not have their fill of laugh
ter in the outset; and knowing that
such aa these would be blind anyway.
be thought it quite as well that they
should wrinkle up their eyes in grins,
as have the malady in less attractive
forms. His own heart laughed; and
that waa aulte enough for him. ...
And it was always aald of him that he
knew how to keep Christmas well, If
any man alive possessed that knowl
edge.
Mav that be truly said of us, and all
of us! "And so, as Tiny Tim observed.

of. the masterpieces of the world's
greatest artists.
These subjects of course) have won
and held the imagination of a long line

In modern art the gospel story no
longer holds Its old place, perhaps, save
among the very devout. But on a sec
ondary artistic level the sculpture and
paintings sold for use In churches show
that the events attending the Infancy
of Christ have,' next to those Of the
crucifixion, the widest currency In rep
resentation. Many of the plaster Se

Whea rulers' and titled men ques
tioned him Jesus placed a child In
the midst of them and said. Of such
is tbe kingdom of heaven." Socrates
sneered at the grief ol a mother weep
tog for her babe. If Plato suggested
that every village should eelect a dis
tant hilltop and build a pen for the
exposure of unwelcome children; If
Aristotle urged laws making the drown
ing of sick and wenrly babes com
pulsory on their parents; if Seneca
said, "We slay the wornout ox and
horse, and it is not wrr.th. but reason,
that separates weak children . from
strong;" If Cicero rebuked his friend
for grief because be' missed the dead
babe, then every lover of childhood
must rise up to speak for that Christ
who took a child in his arms, whose
love brooded over the child as tbe stars
looked down upon tie little town of
Bethlehem and who sent down through
the ages this word." "Suffer little chil
dren to come unto me." Jesus said,
"Take beed that ye offend not one of
my little children," and "Their angels
