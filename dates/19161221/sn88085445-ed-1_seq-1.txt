LYNDEN, WASHINGTON, DECEMBER 21, 19!6
The Tribune 9 s Christmas Present
Double Magazine Model Nineteen Linotype
The old Junior linotype, with i.s maze or wires, that has been the
pride of The Tribune office for the past nine or ten years, was tugged out
into the back yard Saturday, and crippled by a half dozen blows from a
heavy sledge. In its place in The Tribune plant, a smart, young Model 19
Multiple Magazine machine stepped proudly, the latest graduate of the big
Mcrgeaithaler factory.
The Model 19 has a right to be proud. It can do dozens of things
more than the old Junior, and can do them better and twice as fa.-it. Where
the little fellow was forced to confine itself to the setting of the ordinary
news type and only a few columns a day of that, the gay. spick rascal in
the office now will give double the quantity of news matter, together with
an armful of larger type for the advertisements, and do it all without a
grunt or a groan.
The successors of old Ottmar Mergenthaler. inventor of the linotype,
have added a brain to the modern mechanism. Let a green operator fail
to do any one of a dozen things right, and the wise machine will promptly
stop until it is done correctly. A line too short, a line too long, a wrong
sized matrix used, and the clever Nineteen detects the error instantly.
Technically, the new machine has two full size interchangeable maga
zines, and in addition an auxiliary magazine for large display and head let
ter faces; one distributor for all magazines; a water-cooled mold disk; a
universal ejector adjustable to all bodies and measures; a universal knife
block; an automatic font distinguisher and an automatic sorts stacker, and
will set all bodies. 5-point up to 3G-point, and all measures. 4 to 30 ems.
in other words, it is the product of a hundred combined patents, one of
which alone, the double-wedge space, cost the Mergenthaler Company
$410,000.00.
The Tribune is throwing its chert out just a little bit farther at this
Christmas time because of the Model 1!(. The machine is the only one of
its kind that has yet arrived in the county. With it added to the equipment
of the plant, The Tribune stands in the front rank of printing offices as
far as ability to turn out any class of work promptly and well is concerned.
BUTTER DROPS lc;
ADVANCE PREDICTED
Butter descended one cent a pound
Monday, and the price is now equal
with the old record established some
years ago. Butter is now selling at
40 cents a pound.
That an advance may be expected,
is indicated in the following report
received this morning from the Seat
tle market:
"Jobbers are gaining confidence ;
in the future of butter and eggs, due
to increased consumption, decreased
receipts and a general shortage. The
decline of 1 cent early in the week 1
is now pronounced ill-timed and
Without warrant in view of the fact j
that storage butter holdings are es
timated at about 2,500 cubes.
' The butter market will depend ;
largely on the future make. Cream
is sufficient to keep the machinery
going on the present rate of demand,
but since storage butter is dwindling
wholesalers feel they have no safety
valve on future advances. The con
densaries are bidding against cream- j
cry men for milk and within a cer
tain radius of the canned milk plants
the industry has the advantage. The
only weakening influence perceptible
Ito manufacturers is the bare possi-
I bility of getting California butter on
i this market, which must be done on
j a lower price level. Such prices are
I not available at this time. Higher
: prices are regarded as probable with
in a few days."

GROWERS WILL GET
4 CTS. FOR BERRIES
Fruit Association Com
mands Good Price for
Product Next Season.
Four cents a pound is the price
that "berry growers of the Nooksack
Valley will receive for their product
next season, according to an an
nouncement made today by D. F.
Smith, president of the Fruit Grow
ers' Association. This is a higher
figure than the growers have re
ceived for some years, and puts the
industry on a profitable basis.
It was only through united effort
that the growers were able to com
mand this mark for their crop. Of
fers one-half cent lower were made,
but were promptly refused, and the
bids were gradually elevated.
H. A. Baker, of Chicago, who bar
relled the Lynden crop last season:
Pride Brothers of Bellingham, and
the Kale Canning Company of Ever
son. are tendering contracts at four
cents. Forty acres at Nooksack have
been allotted to Baker. The Lynden
berries will probably go to Pride
Brothers, who will collect the fruit
in barrels directly at the patches.
The Everson cannery will take what
ever Prid» is unable to use.
The four cent price include% fur
nishing the crates and barrels, and
means an additional six thousand
dollars to the growers over what
they received last year. The ad
vanced price will enable the growers
to pay better wages for their pickers
next season, and eliminate to a great
extent the trouble of holding pickers.
Mr. Smith is anxious to find out
the amount of berry acreage in the
district in order to make the proper
allotment to the firms, and he asks
that all growers report to him at
once the amount of their acreage and
the varieties raised.
