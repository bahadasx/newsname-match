NEW YORK, Dec. 20. A desire of
the British government to mobilize
under one general head the entire
ocean carrying facilities of the United
Kingdom for the exclusive benefit of
(he allied markets and the great civil
ian population of the allied countries,
is the reason behind the statement of
Premier Lloyd-George that the ship
ping of Great Britain "will be nation
alized according to leading British
shipping men here."-
Third Carry Grain
For some time one of the represen
tative steamship men today said, all
British vessels have one third of their
cargo space commandeered for grain.
This space has recently been' increas
ed to such an extent that now the
New York agent has only about one
third of his ships available for pres
ent shippers.
Cargo Restricted
The same authority says that it was
bis belief that more space would be
controlled by the government by regu
lations requiring that all cargo be of
ficially designated. Designations of
cargo will mean that the shipping in
British bottoms of any commodity
other than, that necessary for main
tenance of army and civil life will be
forbidden.
It is also deemed not unlikely that
British ships now engaged in trade
between neutral countries will be
called upon to take their place in the
line of ships engaged in transferring
supplies to great Braitain and her al
lies. All Under One Flag
"Without official details of the pro
posed nationalization plan," an au
thority in close touch with shipping
said: "I anticipate that in substance
it means the entire resources of
Great Britain's merchant marine is to
be brought under one general head
and that one executive will direct its
movements and its utility. Cargoes
will be jointly apportioned among the
various lines and every ship flying
the flag of Great Britain must do its
part, or the government will take it
over. The people of England and her
armies must be supplied with actual
necessities and the government will
see to it through such control of car
go that no one class of people will get
what all cannot get.
No serious consideration seems to

Much Nearer an End Than Most Dream President Is Careful to Explain He Hasn't
"Directly" Proposed Peace.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20. President Wilosn has. appealed to all the belligerents to
discuss terms of peace.
Without actually proposing peace or offering mediation, the President has sent formal
notes to the governments of all the warring nations suggesting that "an early occasion
be sought to call out from the nations now at war an avowal of their respective views as
to the terms upon which the war might be concluded, and the arrangements which would
be deemed satisfactory as guarantees and the kindling of a new kind of faith as would
mak eit possible frankly to compare them.
Came as Surprise
Wholly without notice and entirely
contrary to what administration offi
cials have described as his course, the
President last night despatched the
notes to all the belligerents and to
all the neutrals for their information.
Summarized in the President's own
words as contained in the notes, the
President says:
How Near? He Asks.
"The President is not proposing
peace; he is not even offering
mediation. He is merely propos
ing that soundings be taken in or
der that we may learn, the neutral
nations with belligerents how near
the haven of peace may be for
which all mankind long with an
Intense and increasing longing.
He believes that the spirit in
which he speaks and the objects
which he seeks will be understood
by all concerned, and he confident
ly hopes for a response which wilt
bring a new light into the affairs
of the world."
This latest development in the
rapidly moving world events toward a
discussion of peace was not permitted
to become known until tonight when
the notes were well on their way to
the American ambassadors in the bel
ligerent capitals and probably in the
hands of some of them.
Startles Washington.
It was a most distinct surprise to
all official Washington, which had
been led to believe that with the for
mal transmittal of the proposal of the
central powers the officers of the
United States would await further
moves between the belligerents them
selves and that certainly, in view of
the speech of Premier. Lloyd-George
and the announcements in Russia.
France and Italy, further ' action by
neutrals would depend on the next
careful and delicate nfbves of the bel
ligerents. Tis Masterly Stroke.
The whole tenor of official opinion
throughout Washington, when the
President's action became known was
that it immeasurably improved the pro
spects for some sort of exchanges rook
ing toward an approach to peace Sis
cussions between the belligerents,
without impairing the position of the
United States should they finally be
unable to find ground on which to ap
proach each ther.
Ruined Village In France Rises Again From
Ashes As Monument of American Friendship
(By Review Leased Wire)
VITR1MONT. France, via Paris. Dec.
20. This village, which. like its neigh
bor. Gerveviller, was destroyed early
in the war, will have the honor of be
,ng the first village reconstructed in
France and this is due to American
enterprise and generosity. The re
building is already under way, the cor

superintending the work. Old men
and youths unfit for military service
are being employed on the building
operations. Miss Tolk's task is not
Secrecy Is Tense.
At the White House no statement
was obtained as to whether any of the
powers had intimated how they would
receive the note, and there was every
indication that the same careful secre
cy, which prevented anything what
ever becoming known about the Presi
dent's action until it had been taken,
would surround any of the succeeding
n.'oves. i
History in Making.
Nowhere on the surface appears any
indication of history-making events
which diplomatists generally are con
vinced must have transpired, since the
German allies brought forth their pro
posals to dispel the generally preval
ent belief that such an action on the
part of President WcW wo.ilrf e vr
acceptable fj the entente powers.
Diplomats "Surprised."
British embassy officials declared
they were utterly taken by surprise,
were wholly unable to explain it and
were emphatic in their statement that
no exchanges whatever had passed
through the embassy here as a pre
liminary. Admits Delicacy.
All that, however, was before the
German allies of their accord brought
forward their proposals for discussion
of peace. President Wils'on specifical
ly says in the notes he is somewhat
embarrassed in making the suggestion
at this particular time, because it may
now seem to have been prompted by
a desire to play a part in connection
with recent overtures of the central
powers.
Playing no Favorite.
To the central powers the President
says his action was in rro way "sug
gested" by the Teutonic proposals,
while to the entente allies he says his
note is in "no way associated with

She has had her first strike in the last

Rebuilding Brings Joy.
The corner stone laying was an
event in Vitrlmont. Grouped about
the ruins and the foundation of the
first structure were the inhabitants and
soldiers on leave of absence. The
American flag, besides the tri-color of
France, was in evidence here and
there, and despite the gloominess of
the situation of the destroyed village,
there was a manifest feeling of joy
that its restoration after original
plans would be seen soon.
Leon Toebe, mayor of Vitrimont.
and M. Mlrman, of Nancy, prefect of
the department Meurthe-et-Mosselle,
spoke thanking the American people
through the ambassador for their gen
erous initiative toward the rebuilding
of the ruined places of France and the
aid which the United States had given
in so many ways.
Replying, Ambassador Sharp said It

he says he "would have delayed offer
ing it until those overtures had been
answered but for the fact that it also
concerns the questfon of peace and
may thus be considered in connection
with other proposals which have the
same end in view."
Diplomats Agog.
Diplomats considered it incredible
that the President would bring for
ward such a proposal at such a time
unless he had reason to believe it
would receive respectful consideration
at the hands of all the belligerents
and above all would not prejudice the
position of the United States as a pos
sible mediator.

ently hopeful that proposals of the cen
tral allies would lead to a discussion
of peace, was expressed in this author
ized statement by Count Bernstorff,
the German ambassador:
"Now," said he, "I am perfectly con
vinced that there will be a confer
ence." T. R's Precedent
The nearest parrallel in world his
tory for President Wilson's action was
President Roosevelt's move in 1905 t'o
end the war between Russia and Japan.
But in that case the President had
been assured his proposal would not
be disagreeable to either of the belig
erents and curiously enough it was
through Emperor William of Germany
that the preliminary soundings crysu
lized into the suggestion that Presi
dent Roosevelt take the steps.
Before that time President Roose
velt had conferred with Count Cassini,
the Russian ambassador here and with
Mr. Takihira. the Japanese minister.
In the Russian capital the American
ambassador, George von L. Meyer, had
conversations with Count Lamsdorff,
the Russian minister for foreign af
fairs. In Tokio, American minister
Griscoiu had conversed with Count
Komura,- the Japanese minister for
foreign affairs. The outcome of all
these preliminaries was that President
Roosevelt was assured that he would
not be humiliated by a rejection of bis
action.

had not only given him much pleasure
to see such highly useful work .begun
by his own countrymen for those who
had been made homeless by the for
tunes of war, but he was greatly in
terested in the possibilities to which
this work, so auspiciously begun,
might lead. He hoped earnestly that
this beneflclent aid might be extend
ed to other villages in the province of
Lorraine, upon which like destruction
had been visited.
In conclusion he complimented those
responsible for the work and referred
feelingly to the fortitude of the af
flicted people under such trying con
ditions. The little girls of the village, who
excel in the art of embroidery, were
presented to the ambassador and they
gave him handkerchiefs, examples of
their work, as souvenirs.

strong probability that Great Britain's i
reply to the German peace proposal '
will be ready before Christmas. This
was the opinion in well informed cir- .
ck where it is said the reply will be ,
l-rief and will likely follow the lines !
of Mr. Lloyd-George's maiden speech
as prime minister in si far as it will
leave the door open for Germany to
make concrete peace proposals.
Great Britain's official reply to Ger
many, as prominent officials preferr
ed to term it. will be submitted simul- I
taneously with that of her allies. Ev- j
er since the German not was handed '
to the foreign office by the American
ambassador, it has been the subject ,
of discussion between Premier Lloyd- j
George and his cabinet council, which !
meets daily.' The note and the nature j
of the reply also have been discussed
with Great Britain's allies and it was ;
stated that these conversations have j
progressed so rapidly that preliminary j
drafts have already been made.
It would, therefore, not be surpris
ing if the allies' replies were ready
by the end of the week. Especially, it
is said, would this be true in the case '
of Great Britain's rote, which the
prime minister is declared to be anx
ious to dispatch without delay.
When the terms of the note are defi
nitely agreed upon and the document
is signed by Lord Robert Cecil, who
is acting foreign secretary in the ab
sence of Mr. Balfour, it may be hand
ed to Ambassador Page with the re
quest that he forward it to the state
department at Washington for trans- j
mission to Germany, l nis is said 10
be the most likely method, inasmuch
as the United States represents the
allies' Interests in Germany. It is just
possible that the British foreign oM
flee may address the reply direct to I
the British ambassador at Washirrg-
ton.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 20. Sharp
controversy in congress over the fut

today at hearings before committees
of both the House and Senate,
Gen. Scott Quizzed
Major General Hugh L. Scott, chief
of staff of the army, encountered vig
orous cross examination by several
members of the House military com
mittee, when he touched upon result
of the mobilization of the state troops
loi Lorjvrtitity as shon in the gen
eral staff report. Conclusions drawn
from the figures to support the con
tention that the guard system is in
efficient and unreliable, were ques
tioned. The sub-committee in charge
of the Chamberlain universal training
till decided to recall General Scott,
who already has presented the mobili
zation in full to that committee and
Major General Leonard Wood, com
manding the eastern department, who
described the mobilization as "a tra
gedy" in his direct hearing before the
committee. Both officers have been
asked to appear for cross examination
by Senator Blair Lee. a champion of
the national guard. An effort yester
day fcy the Maryland senator who Is
not a member of the committee to
question Colonel L. C. Brown, one of
the officers who prepared a report,
was stopped by Chairman Chamber
Iain. The latter determined today,
however, to give Senator Lee every
opportunity to bring out the facts as
to the mobilization.
Spare Guard's Names
In preparation for the cross exami
nation, it is understood that staff of
ficers familiar with mobilization ara
prepared to submit the original re
ports from the inspectors, including
names of the organizations examined.
The compiled summary of these re
ports avoids mention of any specific
units of the guard.
Afraid of Issue
The House committee did not go
into the question of universal military
service recommended by the general
staff and Generals Scott and Wood.
The chief of staff had not reached
that portion of his statement at the
close of the day's session.
