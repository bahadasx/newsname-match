SAYS THAT AS AMERICA IS LIEU MORE IH DANGER OF
LVED, IT IAS A RIGHT TO KNOW EACH BELLIGERENT'S IDEAS.
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 21. President
Wilson's note to all the belligerents,
ruggesting some common ground be
reached for a discussion of terms for
settling the war, is believed to have
reached all belligerent capitals today.
It does not propose' peace terms' nor
offer mediation. It states authorita
tively that President Wilson acted
without assurances that the, move
would be favorably received by the
Triple Entente. It is reported he takes
the position however, that his note
calls for replies and that even if not
favorable, responses A would tend to
nake clear the objects of the bellig
erents which he states in the note has
never been clearly defined. The presi
dent has made clear that while the
. United States has no interest in the
terms upon which peace is finally
made, it has profound interest in
. bringing about an agreement for
maintaining peace in" the future.,
. The German ambassador conferred
witn secretary Lansing this morning,
when it is understood the -
explained the president's action.
AMERICA IN DANGER OF BECOM
ING INVOLVED
Danger of the United" States being
drawn into the European war because
of its increasingly critical position as
a neutral, was one of the main reasons
the president sent a note suggesting
that the belligerents discuss peace
terms. Secretary Lansing authorized
this statement, saying that America's
rights were being more and more in
volved and as the United States was
"drawing nearer the verge of war, it
was entitled to know exactly what
each belligerent seeks," so this coun
try could regulate its future conduct.
The secretary declared' United States
material rights was not the foremost
consideration. The White House de
clined to comment, but didn't attempt
to lessen the importance of Secretary
Lansing's statement.
, A SOBERING FORCE
Secretary Lansing further stated
the sending of this note will indicate
being forced into the war. "That pos
sibility ought to serve as a restrain
ing and sobering force for safeguard
ing American rights. It may also
serve to force an earlier conclusion of
the war." .
President Wilson this afternoon
called Secretary Lansing to the White
House for a conference.

A MYSTERY OF THE SEA
Villa's Band Again Busy in Vicinity
of Parral
(Associated Press)
El Paso, Dec. 21. Arrivals from
Farral reported Villa about to attack
Torreon.
George Giles & Co. have on display
a bale of cotton and while not a very
large one, it .weighs-, 1200 pounds,
having been through one of the great
compresses. The bale is at the Met
roplitan Bank.
There is nothing especially unusual
in the. story so far, but here comes
the unusual part.
The bale of cotton was shipped to
Giles & Co. from Messrs. Smith &
Cooper of. Tampa, to have spun into
yarn, that firm understanding that the
Ocala yarn mill was now in operation.
They will not be disappointed and the
bale will be kept and be one of the
first spun when the factory is in op
eration. This is not unusual, for
Ocala is becoming well known all over
the country as having the first knit
ting mill in the state and for the or
ganization of the first spinning or
yarn mill.
But, this bale of cotton, with some
forty others was picked up by an in
bound Tampa vessel in the gulf
stream several hundred miles from
Tampa, and is supposed to have been
part of a cargo, likely the deck load,
of a vessel sunk by a sea raider of one
of the warring nations, and had drift
ed mayhap for thousands of miles
with the winding current of the gulf
stream.
Just the history, or the, romance of
this bale of cotton may never be
known.

THE NEW CHEF
Mr. E. S. Remy is the new chef at
the Ocala House dining room and
cafe, and part of the success of that
popular eating house is due to his
skill, as he has not taken charge of
the kitchen and store roomr'Mr. Remy
has been chef at the Baltimore of
Kansas City, and the Statler of Cleve
land, and is a thorough master of his
art. With his wife and brother-in-law
and his wife they drove to Ocala
from the north in an automobile and
have rooms at Mrs. Perdue's for the
winter.
Everybody who Has Wood Seems to
be Trying to Hold Ocala Up
-" x
At 3 o'clock this afternoon, the
electric plant had just about enough
fuel to last till tomorrow morning
and the prospect of a shutdown stares
the city in the face.
The trouble is partly due to the
weather but principally to the desire
of almost .everybody who has wood to
sell to hold the city up for a gilt
edged price. Much wood that has been
promised can't be delivered until after
Christmas, because of the indisposi
tion of the negro workmen to labor
during the holidays.
At present the city is obtaining its
own supply from the woods out on the
Silver Springs road, the work being
constantly hindered by the rain.
'We do not know whether the mayor
and council are aware of the fact or
not, but in emergencies they have a
right to seize such a necessity as fuel
wherever they can find it, inside the
city, and use it for the public. need.

ATTRACTIVE WINDOW DISPLAY
The window display arranged at ths
O. K. Grocery by Mr. Howard Clark
is a dandy, and shows that he knows
his business. The arrangement is a
doorway surrounded with pretty
panels of white tissue paper and a
background of the same material.
There is just enough green vines and
holly twigs to give it the holiday ap
pearance. The whole window is then
filled with every imaginable variety
of package goods for the holiday season.

some who will not make an effort to
secure their share of the awards.
Some have been nominated by over-
enthusiastic friends who are not al
ways able to judge the true ability

others for one reason or another will
be unable to participate.

benefit themselves slip by. The Star
is offering absolutely the best returns

equipped, and without one cent of
cost to you. - Think of the chance to
own a piano, an Edison talking ma
chine or one of the ' other splendid
prizes, simply by becoming a member
cf the 3,000 Club. Be your impres
sions what they may, from any source
regarding the pleasure of owning and
driving an automobile, you will never
know real motoring until you have
driven this powerful little Maxwell.
The first thing to do, if you intend
to take an active part in the race is
to see that your name is properly en
tered on the list. Fill out the nomi
nation blank in this issue and send it
in at once. This will give you 5,000
votes to start off with. Then you
should turn to your telephone, write
or see your friends personally and
make it plain to them that you are
going to expect them to help you.
They will be glad to do such a small
favor for you and it will not be long
before you will have a start on the
winning road.
After you have once broken the ice,
you will find it easy to keep the ball
rolling and come out a winner. The
hardest part of the task is taking the
first steps and in this case, the first
step is easy. Of course you must
push ahead drifting will never get
yon anywhere. In winning one of
the splendid awards like honor and
fame, you can only do so by earnest
effort. When you think of the valu
able awards, you will not hesitate to
put forth a little effort. Go in to win
and you will come out a winner.

W ESTERN UNION ISSUES 1 " ' '
A HELPFUL BOOKLET
Frequently persons wishing to send
a telegram of congratulation or of
sympathy are troubled about the
wording of the message. Often the
telegraph "managers are appealed to
for suggestions, and the Western
Union Telegraph company, observing
this, has realized that the prepara
tion of a collection of suggested forms
for such messages would fill a real
want. It has therefore issued a 24-
page booklet containing suggestions
for the wording of telegrams appro
priate to New Year's Day, Easter,
Thanksgiving Day, Christmas, birth
days, weddings, and new arrivals via
the stork route, messages of condo
lence, and congratulatory messages to
school or college graduates and to
public men. They are intended as
suggestions only, and may be chang
ed and modified according to indi
vidual taste and the exigencies of the
particular occasion. The typograph
ical arrangement is very attractive
and altogether the pamphlet repre
sents a rather novel departure in the
way of an effort to be of assistance
to the telegraph using public and
should prove of use to many. Copies
may be obtained on application to
Manager C. K. Sage.
