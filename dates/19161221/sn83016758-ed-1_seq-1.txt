ROUSING RECEPTION
Princeton Welcomes Returning Sol-
diers With Open Arms Tues-
day NightA Big Time.
Banquet at I. O. O. F. Hall Followed
by a Program and Dance at
the Princeton Armory.
A rousing welcome greeted the
members of Co. upon their return
from the Mexican border, Tuesday
evening, and it was a big night in
Princeton. The old town met the reaudience
turning Rum river valley boys with
open arms, and joy reigned supreme.
The train was more than an hour
late but hundreds were at the depot
to meet the boys, and when the cars
pulled in the large whistles at the
power plant and mill shrieked their
welcome, while the school and churoh
bells of the village, clanged their
greeting to the returning soldiers.
A turkey supper awaited the boys
at the I. O. O. F. hall, and visitors
from Milaca were also invited to par
take of same. The ladies of the Civic
Betterment club were in charge, al
though various Matrons and Misses,
who are not affiliated with same, lent
their assistance. ItSvas an appetizing
repast, such a one as only the good
housewives of Princeton can prepare,
and there was an abundance of good
eatables for all. Needless to state
the soldier boys did complete justice
to the tempting viands set before
them.
Mrs. J. C. Herdliska, president of
the Civic Betterment club, is entitled
to unstinted praise for her untiring
and successful efforts in getting up
such a splendid feast. She was ably
assisted by a host of other ladies. In
fact every lady in town seemed
anxious to do something to make it
pleasant for the boys, and to make
the banquet the success it certainly
was. There was more than enough
left over from the feast to provide the
Milaca boys and their friends with a
nice lunch yesterday.
A public reception followed at the
Armory, which was tastefully decor
ated for the occasion with flags and
'bunting, and an appropriate program
was there carried out. R. C. Dunn
presided in the absence of Dr. H. C.
Cooney, who responded to a sick call
and was unable to serve for that
reason.
Never before was the spacious Arm
ory so crowded. The gallery was packed
and every seat on the floor was oc-and
cupied, and many stood up. When the
Company boys filed in and took the
seats that were reserved for them the
mmense audience stood up and greeted
them with round after round of ap
plause.
Pleasing selections by that ever
popular musical organization, the high
school orchestra, opened the exercises
and a male chorus then sang that old
favorite, "Columbia, the Gem of the
Ocean." Remarks by R. C. Dunn fol
lowed.
Mr. Dunn briefly thanked those
present for attending, and voiced the
fact that all Princeton is glad that the
boys are back with loved ones. Re
gret was expressed over the demise
of Gustaf Flink, a Milaca member of
the company, and sympathy tendered
the bereaved relatives. The speaker
stated that Princeton had kept in
touch with the boys, and that all had
reason to believe that the Rum r^jver
valley soldiers had won the approval
and admiration of their superior offi
cers. Fate treated the company kind
ly, and the members were not forced
to undergo the rigors of a regular
war campaign. But every duty im
posed upon the boys was so discharged
as to reflect honor and credit upon
themselves, and Mr. Dunn expressed
the opinion that had they been called
upon to do battle, they would have
acquitted themselves as Minnesota
soldiers always have in the past.
The speaker then called attention
to the fact that the Rum river valley
lias ever been patriotic. Brave boys
represented this section in the gallant
JC First Minnesota that won imperisha
ble fame over half a century ago, as
-well as in other regiments of equal
intrepidity. A company from here
abouts was also ready to serve their
country during the Spanish-American
war, and in 1916 the Rum river valley
again responded to the call of the
nation's chief executive. In conclu
sion Mr. Dunn said that all had rea
son to be proud of the sturdy, manly
lot of boys, and again expressed
Princeton's welcome, which comes
right from the heart.
Captain A. H. Johnson, in behalf of
the company, thanked the citizens for
the splendid reception accorded the
Minn."Historical Societ
soldiers, and added that Mille Lacs
county looked better than ever to
them. He called attention to the fact
that the reports of Co. G, which have
been filed in Washington, are spotless
there is not a mark against any
member of the company. This is a
wonderful showing, and highly grati
fying to friends of the boys. Captain
Johnson concluded by stating that on
the whole the members of the com
pany returned in a better physical
condition, that the experience had
broadened them, and that he was cer
tain that no one regretted the six
months passed on the border.
The male chorus again favored the
with a song familiar to all,
"When Johnny Comes Marching
Home," and then Wm. V. Sanford dis
charged a duty entrusted to him byworthy
the company. He presented neatly en
graved gold watches to Captain John
son and Lieutenant Morton, gifts from
the boys, prefacing the presentations
with appropriate remarks. Lieuten
ant Kalkman was unable to be present,
but he also received a watch. This is
ample evidence that the officers en
joyed the confidence and esteem of
their men in a marked degree.
Attorney E. L. McMillan then de
livered brief remarks, contrasting the
spirit prevailing at the home-coming,
with the misgivings and doubts ex
isting at the farewell reception six
months ago. "You looked good then,"
said the speaker, "but you look bet
ter now." Mr. McMillan next called
attention to the fact that expectations
had been borne out, and that the boys
had done whatever called upon to do
like men. He expressed the opinion
that if more serious and dangerous
work had been necessary they would
have met it with the same spirit. Co.
was well officered, said the speaker,
and a splendid showing was made.
Capt. Johnson was the only company
commander in the Third regiment to
get his clearance at once. Everything
was promptly accounted for, and con
siderable of the credit is due to Quar
termaster Gordiner. The records were
all in ship-shape order, also, and this
facilitated mustering out. The officer
in charge awarded the palm to Co.
in this respect, and the speed of mus
tering out surprised hinu The mess
account showed a slight profit, where
as numerous companies had over
drawn their accounts. There were no
black marks against this company,
and not one man had charges pre
ferred against him. In conclusion
Mr. McMillan stated that if the boys
are as glad to get home as we are to
see them, then this Christmas and
New Year will indeed be the happiest
merriest ever known.
One of the hits of the evening was
a parody on "Tipperary," written by
Mrs. J. F. Petterson, sung by the
male chorus, and it fairly brought
down the house. It appears here
under:
TIPPERARY.
Down to dry. old Texas went a lusty
bunch one day.
"They're the finest lads we've seen"
said the girls along the way.
"Oh, we love you so, they cried, "Tell
us quick from where you come."
"We're from Minnesota gay, from the
banks of the old Rum."
CHORUS.
It's a long way to Mille Lacs County.
It's a leng way to go.
It's a Long way to Mille Lacs County,
To the sweetest girl I know.
Farewell Llano Grande. Goodby Rio Grande!
It's a long way to Mille Lacs County,
It's a long way to go.
"Oh, you Minnesota boys! We think
you're darlings all!
We cheer for you! We fear for youcome
at your nation's call.
Of your captain we're afraid, he seems
so very stern.
No Mexican can harm him for he'll
all bullets turn."
CHORUS.
"Oh, your nifty two lieutenantsthey
were never made to shoot.
We hope the 'Mexs' won't get them.
They're so handsome 1 They're so cute!
And all you dear brave privates! We
could hug youev'ry one.
If the Mexicans but see you, they will
drop their guns and run."
CHORUS.
"With your serge'nts we'll not flirt. We've
read them like a book:
For all but one among them have a set
tled married look.
And that one's shy and bashful. We
cannot win him over.
So far the only thing we know is that
his name is Grover."
CHORUS.
"With your corporals it is diff'rent, they
are jolly boys.
There is but one among them whom
our flattery annoys.
We love the jolly privates, the non
coms, and you all.
That 'Sweetest Girl' we envy, but we
hope she hears your call."
CHORUS.
Master Elliott Radeke then contrib
uted a vocal solo to the evening's en
tertainment, and responded to an
encore. The little fellow did himself
proud.
A special invitation to attend the
show, "It's a Long Way to Tipperary,"
at the Armory Christmas Eve, was ex
tended to the company by R. C. Dunn
in behalf of the Lona Fendell Stock
Co. and Manager Krusche of the
Crystal. Mr. Dunn also pledged his
support to a bill providing for special
compensation for the soldiers from the
state.
The program concluded when the
?^"r%
R. C. DUNN, Publisher. Terms, $1.00 Per Year. PRINCETON, MILLE LACS COUNTY, MINNESOTA, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1916
chorus favored those present with a
song loved by all, "America."
But the entertainment did not end
with the conclusion of the program.
The floor was then cleared, and all
danced to lilting selections discoursed
by Anderson's orchestra. The throng
that tripped the light fantastic was a
joyous one, and the "Home Sweet
Home" waltz came all too soon, al
though it was after 3 o'clock.
It was a fitting and cordial recep
tion, and the welcome was sincere.
Princeton is glad that the boys are
back, and particularly glad to see
them looking so fit. Here's good luck
to them, now and evermore!
Tom Olsen, who had general charge
of the whole affair, was also untiring
in his efforts to make the affair one
of the occasion, and no mis
take was made in selecting him for
general manager. He made good in
every particular. He was on the job
all the time. Tom is all right.
A special effort was made to make
it pleasant for the Milaca members of
the company and their friends. The
Milaca boys are all fine fellows and
a credit to that town.
Spud Notes.
The focal potato market remains un
changed, and the prices quoted else
where are the same as last week. No
potatoes are moving, and there has not
been a load marketed here the past
week, nor have there been any ship
ments from this point.
The Chicago potato market re
mained easy last week, and the tone
of inquiries indicate that the call will
be light until after the first of the
year. The demand at this season is
usually light, but many operators had
anticipated more than ordinary activ
ity for December and early January
because of their belief that the out
side trade had not bought as heavily
as usual and hence would be in the
market right along as their demands
required. It now begins to look as if
this "dope" was wrong and that the
buying trade was holding more stock
than dealers had estimated. It is well
known that a lot of stock changed
hands and moved out during October
and some draw the conclusion that
with the high prices curtailing con
sumption, a reasonable supply was left
over with which to supply the demand
until the spring movement is again
under way.
Operators who are holding much
stock in warehouses, however, are not
bearish because of the fact that hold
ings in the production centers are lim
ited. Michigan has shipped heavily
from her short crop, as has Wisconsin.
In Minnesota the Sandland district is
well cleaned out now and the most of
the limited supplies held there are out
of original hands. In the Red River
Valley it is estimated that not over
550 cars are now held, with about 300
of those within Clay county. The Da
kotas have but a few cars scattered
here and there, and the western states
have been shipping heavily for the
past two months. Some estimates
have it that 65 per cent of the crop
has been shipped out of Washington,
and better than 50 per cent of the
crop out of Oregon and Idaho.
The New York potato market was in
much better condition last week than it
has been for several weeks. ,The em
bargo placed by the railroads at Har
lem River enabled those yards to clean
up nicely and the middle df this week
there were not over 140 cars in both
the Harlem and the Thirty-third street
yards. Prices were higher and there
was a great deal better demand from
the jobbing trade. The situation is no
different in the country than it has
been for some time. Farmers are very
firm in their ideas and on account of
the lower prices prevailing here a
great many out-of-town shippers can
not get the stock so they can sell it
with any profit, delivered in New
York. In New York state the farmers
were getting $1.50 per bushel at the
loading station and shippers were ask
ing $1.60to$1.65 delivered inNewYork.
Illustrated Lecture.
Rev. T. J. E. Wilson of Hinckley
gave an illustrated lecture of Van
Dyke's Fourth Wise Man, to members
of the K. P. lodge one evening last
week and it was an intellectual treat.
Rev. Wilson has a pleasing style of ad
dress, and he held the closest attention
of his audience throughout. A. L.
Sperry, Grand Chancellor of the
Knights of Pythias, after hearing Rev.
Wilson lecture, wrote him as follows:
"I was pleased with your illustrated
rendition of Van Dyke's Fourth Wise
Man, and feel that we have been well
repaid for the evening you gave us.
It is worth while for any Pythian
lodge to have your evening, and all
deputies and chancellor commanders in
the state are advised to have same if
satisfactory arrangements can be
made."

Jerry H. Kalkman.
Jerry H. Kalkman, a resident of
this place until five weks ago, when
he moved with his family to Rib Lake,
Wis., died very suddenly at that place
last Thursday. Death was due to
heart failure. Appearing to be in the
best of health, as he always was, de
ceased had gone out at noon to do
the chores. When he failed to return
at the usual hour his family became
worried, and an investigation resulted
in the finding of his lifeless body.
The remains were brought to Prince
ton, and funeral services were con
ducted from St. Edward's church
Tuesday morning by Rev. Ft. Willen
brink. Numerous friends attended the
last services, and the Catholic Order
of Foresters, of which deceased was
a faithful member, escorted the re
mains to the cemetery.
Jerry H. Kalkman was born at New
Richmond, this state, November 12,
1864. He made St. Cloud his home for
a time, and was united in marriage in
that city to Miss Mary Rosha. Two
years later he came to Princeton, and
he operated a farm north of the vil
lage. This he sold recently and set
tled on a 160-acre farm near Rib
Lake, Wis. He is survived by his wife
and three children, Eugene H., of Co.
Hildegard, who is teaching school,
and Gwendelin, still at home. Four
brothers also survive him, viz: John,
Henry and Nicholas of St. Cloud, and
Barney of St. Henry, N. D. All the
brothers, with the exception of the last
named, were present at the funeral, as
were deceased's brother-in-law and
sister-in-law, Frank Rosha and Mrs.
A. Klaverkamp of St. Augusta.
Deceased had a most likeable per
sonality, and was possessed of qual
ities that win friendship and esteem.
His sudden taking away came as a
distinct shock to numerous friends
here. That kind Heaven may soften
the grief of the bereaved relatives is
the wish of all.
