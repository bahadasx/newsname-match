SUIT FILED TO BREAK

Part of Father-in-law's Es
tate Alleges Fraud, Mis
representation and -Undue,
Influence -Judge X. N.
Steeves Attorney for Plain
tiff The futility of wills has been
demonstrated time after time.
The newspapers contain fre
quent accounts of the efforts of
dissatisfied heirs to break wills
which did not give them the
recognition to which they thot
themselves entitled, and be
cause of some oversight in
drawing the will, or neglect to
take cognizance of a change
in conditions since the will was
drawn, the courts find that the
provisions of the will can not
be carried out as the testator
intended at the time the will
was executed. In such case the
, will must be abrogated and the
testator's property divided in
accordance with a plan which
seems to the court fully justi
fied by the law relating to such
cases, or the satisfied benefic
iaries of the will must go to
considerable expense to con
vince the court that neither
law nor equity would be violat
ed by carrying out the provis
ions of the will as plainly stat
ed in its text.
Williams will be interested
in the attempt to break the will
of Gus Riemer who died a few
months ago. An action has
been started by Clifford Klock
husband of Mr. Riemer's
daughter by adoption, on be
half of his wife, Mrs. Nellie
Riemer Klock; to set aside Mr.
Riemer's will and also the set
tlement between ' Mrs. Riemer
and her daughter, Mrs. Klock,
by the terms of which Mrs.
Klock waived her interest in
Mr. Riemer's estate in consid
eration of certain stipulated
payments!- 1
, Williams' people will recall
that Gus Riemer, a bachelor of
75, married in 1915. Some
time after- his marriage, Mr.
Riemer made a will naming his
wife as his sole heir. Later he
adopted his wife's daughter,
Nellie. Then followed the
marriage of his adopted daugh
ter to Clifford Klock and final
ly Mr. Riemer's death Sept. 4,
1916. .Mrs. Riemer was duly
appointed executrix of her hus
band's will and she made a set
tlement with her daughter,
Mrs. Klock, Mr. Clifford Klock
joining in the settlement. This
settlement was made in lieu of
all claims which Mrs. Klock
might have against the Gus
Riemer estate, by reason of be
ing an adopted daughter.
And now Mr. Clifford Klock
thru his attorney, Judge X. N.
Steeves, seeks to set aside the
settlement and the will and al
leges fraud, misrepresentation
and undue influence.
This is destined to be a very
interesting case and Williams
people will watch its develop
ment with great interest.
Mr. Chas. Mahan, brother-in-law
of M. C. Smith, drove
into Williams last Friday even
ing, from Ontario, Calif. Mr.
Mahan has come to Arizona
for the purpose of residence
and will settle in or near Wil
liams as soon as he can find a
suitable location,. . The Mahans
will be guests of Mr. and Mrs.
Smith until a location is found.
OUSY P. M.
FOR JUDGE TITTY

busy afternoon Tuesday, con
ducting the preliminary hear
ing in two important cases. At
Ftwo o'clock Ed Emerson who
had been dodging a warrant
for several weeks had a hear
ing on a charge of aggravated
assault. Emerson was bound
over to the Superior court in
the sum of $500. Patsy Park
er who claimed to be the
assaulted party, was put under
$100 bond to appear at Emer
son's trial as a chief witness.
At 4 o'clock Simplicio Tor
rez had his preliminary hear
ing on a charge of burglary.
Torrez was charged with

STRANDED IN WILLIAMS J
Mr. A. Taube, wife and eight
children arrived in Williams
from Denver, Tuesday night,
practically stranded and un
able to pay for a night's lodg
ing. Judge Twitty gave them
the use of his office with the
privilege of coal for a fire.
The Taube family left Port
land, Maine, several months
ago in search of health for the
mother. The Portland doc
tors told her that she must have
a change of climate, preferab
ly warmer. With an auto fit
ted as well as possible for fam
ily life the Taubes made their
way south as far as Baltimore.
They then worked' west and
finally brought up in Denver
where they remained for five
months, Mr. Taube and the
oldest boy working for the city
while there.
Failing to find health for
Mrs. Taube, which was the ob
ject of the trip, the Taubes
struck south-west, determined
to make Phoenix. They had
considerable machine trouble
and by the time they had
reached Williams, their funds
were about gone. Warmed
and rested, the family resumed
their journey on Wednesday
morning. They expect to be
able to reach Phoenix about
Saturday. They will have
traveled fully 6,000 miles in
search of what has so far prov
ed an ignis fatuus, health for
mother.

PLANS FOR NATIONAL
FOREST SIGNS
At the local Forest Service
office it is announced that plans
are under way tor extensive
installation of road and trail
signs on the Tusayan National
Forest. These will conform to
the standards recently adopted
by the Forest Service in Ari
zona and New Mexico. The
Rangers have been busy gath
ering data for the various loca
tions and the most important
signs will be made this winter
and installed as soon as weath
er permits in the spring. Spe
cial attention will be given to
guide and warning signs along
the main travelled roads. It is
contemplated, however, to post
all roads and trails with ade
quate signs as fast as funds can
be secured.
5 ELECTRIC
DAM EIGHT FEET
'$6,500 Spent to Increase the
Capacity of Their Reservoir
Three Fold
The Williams Water & Elec
tric Co. has under way work on
their reservoir which when
completed will increase the ca
pacity of the reservoir fully
three fold, and will put the
storage basin in much better
condition than formerly.: The
work on the dam was complet
ed early this week. The dam
has not only been raised but
it has been strengthened and
otherwise improved. It is not
only a success from an engi
neering point of view, but it is
also a work of art in its finished
condition.
The dam is 335 feet long at
the crest and has a width of six
feet at the same elevation. The
outer slope is 2 to 1 and the in
ner slope about 1V& to 1 on an
average. The dam is, in the
main, of earth of which clay is
an important constituent. The
outer slope is brought to an ev
en surface and is clay. The in
ner slope is riprapped thoroly .
with volcanic boulders.
The addition to the dam will
give a maximum depth ofwater
when the reservoir is full, of 35
feet. A considerable area of
new territory will be ' flooded
and the company is at work
removing trees,' stumps, logs
and all other forms of organic.-''
material from the surface that
will be covered. The trees,
stumps, logs and brush will be
removed while the leaves and .
smaller particles of organic ;:
matter will be carefully raked
and burned. It is the intention
of the company to be very thor
ough in this work and to leave -nothing
which may affect, the :
water deleteriously.
Flood waters which more -than
fill the reservoir will be
taken care ofby two outlet v
pipes and. by a spillway at the
surface of the dam at the east
end. The reservoir will , be. '
fenced to keep stock from the .
water. It would be a benefit to
the water which Wilfiems must
drink to fence the entire drain-
age area, which contributes to
the water supply. This prob
ably will not be done for some
time, but eventually commun- ,
ity 'well-being may call so in
sistently for it that it will be
accomplished. .
The supply of water which
the company has on hand is npt
large. It is estimated that the .
water may last until March 1
without any addition to it.
However, water taken from the N
reservoir about March 1 would 1
be very undesirable and we
may well hope that the supply
will be replenished before that
time. The low stage of water
in the reservoir should be a
warning to consumers to avoid
waste in the use of water.
