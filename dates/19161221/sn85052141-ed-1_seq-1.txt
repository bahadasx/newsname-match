HEAVY EARTHQUAKE
SHOCK MONDAY NIQHT.
An earthquake shock of extra
ordinary intensity was experi
enced here Monday night about
11 :40, and many folks were sud
denly awakened frum their peaee
Iful gluuibt-rs. A slight rumbling
n-i.so of two or three aevondsdu
rati4.11 prtx-eded the first Jiook,
nor coiicu.sition. The initial ahuke
luight well le described as
though some very heavy objwet
had rammed tne a house, or a
great explosion, literally shaking
and jarring every thing in the
way of dtor., windows, dishes,
etc. The din was fallowed by a
rocking or swinging Neusutum
which continued to rattle loe
objects in a most uueojufortable
manner, gradually diminishing in
Peverity until it suicided about 30
to 0 seconds later.
.This is the second shock felt
tf'U yeur, but the Later' was
without doubt the mol severe in
u any yearn. Ti e sudden awak
ening fallowing its advent gives
one a creepy, weird, helpless feel-
lug. While the s und indicates
that all the di-hes will be broken
up, nothing tf the kind results;
in fact, no visible damage could
be detected Tuesday.

DO BE CAREFUL.
Don't take all the pleasure out
of Christmas books or oaklet
by writing cheerful "Xnias"
messages on them before you

write n them you prevent the
recipient from raising them on
to others as his gift, and your
friends will have to go out and do
lot of shopping.

The Home Main Canndt'-Mford to Deceive Yom
Buy Your Glasses and Have Them Properly Fitted At Home by Your HomeOptician-Dr. Chester
To the People of Hickman and
vicinity:
I am permanently located here.
1 have been here for some time. I
have fitted over one hundred pairs
of glasses for satisfied patrons.
I have founded my business on
GOOD SERVICE and FAIR
TREATMENT, with prices to suit
everybody. Getting glasses from
one permanently located in your
city means something in that you
can have some recourse.
Your children should have atten
tion. They may have headache
due to eye trouble while studying
ct cchool. If they make a poor
7zdz they may need glasses. I
ccn teff you without charge.

One needing glasses certainly knows
they need better than dollar glasses.

EYE SPECIALIST
Office ewsr Hichmcn cDrag Co,
Don't just buy glasses. Have -your
eyes tested and fitted by a
specialist, that knows what your
eyes need.
Glasses, to give satisfaction, must
be ground to fit each individual eye.
You have only one pair of eyes;
they are worth the world to you-
so be good to them. Do not: wear
CHEAP glasses. But have each
eye tested and get glasses ground
to fit each one. There are no two
pairs of eyes just exactly alike.
Fitting glasses properly is a busi- ,
ness that cannot be rushed
through done in a day and gve
the patient good, professional ser
vice. In buying glasses you bujr
SE1RVICE as much as material
and this requires time. ; "
