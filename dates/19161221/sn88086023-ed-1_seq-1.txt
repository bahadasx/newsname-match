WHEN AND WHY IS GAMBLING?
QUESTION PERPLEXES COUNCIL
When Is gambling and when is it
not?
This grave question Is perplexing
the city council and last evening was
the subject of considerable specula
tion, cogitation and deliberation.
There was no Solomon among them
to give a happy Judgment that would
Insure the elimination of the moral
evil of cards and yet preserve the
pleasure of a friendly game.
The decision resulted from the
mayor's query as to whether playing
for "hlckies" or trade checks Is gam
bling. Recorder Fits Gerald produced
the ordinance which defines gambling
as any irame played for money, checks
or any' bin tharf represents value. It
was plain that "hlckies" represent
value and, almost before the discus
sion started, the city attorney and
chief of police had been Instructed to
enforce the ordinance to the letter
But what is the letter? This was
an afterthought nnd provoked renew
ed discussion. It was agreed that II
trade cheeks were het on a card gnme
it cons' it ued gambling. But ho
about playing for the "ho." By this
It was explained that, when a carl
game Is finished, It Is the custom of
the low man to pay the house flvo
cents a hand. In rejturn the manage
ment gives a B-cent trade check for
each nlckle he receives. Instead
however, of each player receiving a
check, the high man gets them nil,
which Is calld "winning the hog."
It was held by some of the council,
men that this technically was gam
bling Inasmuch as the high mnn was
receiving a prize of vlotory. There
upon, some one a'ked. "How about n
turkey shoot?" A turkey shoot Is a

band acquired a new saddle mount,
which promptly threw him as soon

quered It. Mr. Averlll reports that

this led to one councilman declaring
that some of the women in the city:

opinion thnt the law permits the n

game equivalent to one for the treats,
he said, and the law permits this. The

WILSON ASKS WARRING
LANDS FOR SHOWDOWN
OUR BIS HADED ID
111 NEAR
SAYS IN EXPLAINING
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. Secretary Lansing said the desire for a
complete showdown by the belligerents because American rights had
been Invaded was the real purpose behind President Wilson's note. He
declared frankly the United States was "drawing nearer to the verge
of war." The situation cannot continue. He authorized the following
statement:
"Our rights have been Invaded. The situation is becoming Intoler
able. Belligerents on both sides are Invading American rights more
andmnre. The situation is increasingly critical. I mean the United
States is drawing nearer the verge of war and is therefore entitled to
know what the belligerents want, so we can regulate our future con
duct." Lansing emphasized positively that the German peace proposal and
Lloyd George'a speech were not connected with the sending of Wil
son's note. He declared the president did not intend to suggest peace.
He wants to render the neutrals positions less Intolerable. Lansing's
whole talk emphasized the Idea that America must "do something"
in the event her rights are further invaded.
British, Italian, Japanese, German, Bulgarian, Russian and Turk
ish ambassadors visited Lansing this morning and received copies of
the note to forward to their governments. Lansing said Wilson finally
decided to send the note Monday. He forwarded it Monday night
and Tuesday morning.
Lansing said: "No nation has been sounded on this matter. We
didn't know in advance what Lloyd George would say. No consider
ation of the German overtures or Lloyd George's speech had any con
nection with the sending of the note. The German overtures possibly
delayed the note a few days.
"The president feared the note maybe would be construed as a peace
movement In aid of the German overtures. He specifically denied that
the overtures were a factor in the communication."
Lansing repeatedly emphasized that the feeling there Is danger the
United States may be drawn Into the war. He said the administra
tion manted "what would satisfy the belligerents in regard to
ending the. war. ' -

Belligerents are Requested to Outline Exact Terms for Ending
War; Does Not Propose Peace Nor Offer Mediation But
Indicates Willingness to Serve if Desired.
COMMUNICATIONS ARE DISPATCHED WITHOUT NOTICE
President Explain that America is Only Interested Now in Sew
ing Conclusion of War Means Used to Gain End Not of
Importance to U. S., Although Mores to Gain Permanent
Peace Will Be of Much Moment.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. President Wilson has sent formal
notes to all belligerent governments asking them to divulge
peace terms, and asking their views on arrangements to guar
antee permanent peace.
The president is not proposing peace, he is not even offering
mediation. He is merely proposing that soundings be taken in
order that we may learn, the neutral nations with the belliger
ent, how near the haven of peace may be for which all man
kind longs witn an intense ana
The notes to the belligerents are
prefaced with this instruction by Sec
retary Lansing to the American am
bassadors presenring them:
"The president directs me to send
you the following communication to
be presented Immediately to the min
ister of foreign affairs of the govern
ment to which you are accredited."
Text of Notes Given.
The text of the notes themselves
then begin Identically as follows:
"The president of the United State
has Instructed me to suggest to the
(here Is Inserted a designation of the
government addressed) a course of
action with regard to the present war
which he hopes that the government
will take under consideration as sug
gested In the most friendly spirit and
as coming not only from a friend, but
also as coming from the representa
tive of a neutral nation whose Inter
ests ave, been most seriously affected
by the war and whose concern for Its
early conclusion arises out of a man
ifest necessity to determine how best
to safeguard those interests if the war
is to continue."
At this point the texts vary. In
the notes to the central powers this
paragraph follows next:
"The suggestion which I am in
structed to make the president ha
long had it In mind to offer. He is
somewhat embarrassed to offer it at
this particular time because It mas
seem to have been prompted by a de
sire to play a part in connection with
the recent overtures of the central
powers. It has, in fact, been In no
way suggested by them In Its origin
and the president would have delayed,
offering it until those overtures had j
been independently answered, but for.
the fact that it also concerns the ques
tion of peace and may best be consid
ered in connection with other propos
als which have the same end in view.
The president can only beg that his
suggestion be considered entirely or
iU merits, and as if lit had been mad.-
in other circumstances." '
Allies Notes Slightly Different.
In the note to the entente allies the
following paragraph takes the place
of the one Just quoted:
"The suggestion which I am In
structed to make, the president his
long had it in mind to offer. He is
somewhat embarrassed to offer it at
this particular time because it may
seem to have been prompted by the
recent overtures of'th central powers.
It is, in fact, in no way associated with
them in Its origin and the president
would have delayed offering It until
those overtures had been answered
but for the fact that It also concerns
the question of peace and may best
be considered in connection with oth
er proposals which have the same end
in view. The president can only beg
that his suggestion be considered en
tirely on its own merits and as If it

Then all the notes proceed Identi

to him as another if only the great

"He takes the liberty of calling at

which the statesmen of the belliger

stated in general .terms to their own
people and to the world. Each side
