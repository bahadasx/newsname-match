HICH HEELS PUT
CORNS ON TOES
Tells women how to dry up a corn
so it lifts out without
pain.
Modern high-heeled footwear buck
les the toes and produces corns, and
many of tho thousands of hospital
cases of infection and lockjaw are the
result of woman's suicidal habit of
trying to cut away these painful
pCBtS.
for little cost there can be obtained
at any pharmacy a quarter of au
ounce of a drug called freezone, which
Is sufficient to rid one's feet of every
hard or soft corn or callus without
the slightest danger or inconvenience.
A few drops applied directly upon
the tender, aching corn stops the
soreness and shortly the entire corn,
root and all, lifts right out. It is a
sticky substance, which dries the mo
ment it is applied, and thousands of
men and women use it because the
corn shrivels up and conies out win
out inflaming or even irritating tho
surrounding tissue or skin. Cut this
out and try it if your corns bother
you.

WILSON APPEALS
FOR DISCUSSION
OF PEAKIERHS
President Sentfs Suggestive Note
to Belligerent nations
NEUTRALS BECOMING RESTIVE
Secretary Lansing Intimates Anxiety
Regarding Our Own Position is
Real Motive for Overture.
Washington, Dec. 21. President
Wilson has appealed to all the belli
gerents to discuss tonus of peace
Without actually proposing peace or
offering mediation, tho president has
sent formal notes to the governments
of all the warring nations suggesting
that "an early occasion be sought to
call out frofn the nations now at war
such an avpwal of their respective
views as to ;the terms upon which tho
war might lie concluded and the ar
rangemeuts which would be deemed
satisfactory as a guarantee against Its
lenewal or the kindling of any simi
lar conflict In the future as would
make it possible frankly to compare
them."
Wholly without notice and entirely
contrary to what administration ofli
dais nave described as tils course,
the president Tuesday night dls
patched the notes to tall the belliger
ents and to all the neutrals for their
information.
Summarized in the president's own
words as contained in the notes, his
attitude is ns follows: "The presi
dent is not proponing peace; he is not
even offering mediation. He is
merely proposing that soundings be
taken in order that we may learn, the
neutral nations with the belligerent
how. near the haven of peace may be
for -which all mankind longs with an
Intenso and increasing lonplng. He
believes that the spirit in which he
epeaks and the objects which he
seeks will te .understood by all con
cerned, and he cwifidently hopes for a
response which wfN bring a new light
Into the affairs of the world."
Washington, Dec. 21. Plainly hint
ing that danger of the 1 fitted Slates
being drawn into the European war
was the real reason behind President
Wilson's note to the belligerents,
Secretary of State lnslng today is
sued a statement in which he v said
that the position of neutral nations
was becoming intolerable and that
this government was anxious for a
"show down."

PASSED AWAY
LAST Hf
State's First Arorney - General
Dead in His 47ih Year
BRILLIANT BRATTLEB3R0 LAWYER
Self-Made Vermonter Who From His
Youth Had Been Identified With
Large Enterprises.
Clarke C. Fitts, 4ti, of Brattlehoro,
former attorney-general of Vermont
died at 8 o'clock last night at the
home of his sister-in-law, Airs. Otis, in
Watertown, Aiass! lie was operated
on. November 8 in Boston for Inter
nal trouble, and was moved to Water
town Thanksgiving day.
By the death of Clarke Cushing
Fitts, Brattlehoro looses a man who
had been most prominent in the af
fairs of the town and of the state in
the last 15 years. As an attorney of
unusual ability, recognized far be
yond the bounds of his native state,
and as a man who always had tho In
terests of his home town and his na
tive state first at heart, he hud stood
well in the forefront of Vermonurs.
Air. Fitts was bom In Wurdshoro,
October 17, 1870, a son of Osmer
C. and Abbie AI. (Twitchol!) FiUs.
His father died when his son was 14
years old. Air. Fitts's education was
obtained in a few terms in the Leland
and Gray seminary at Townshend,
and one year In Brattlehoro high
school, from which ho was graduated
Ho taught school a short time and
entered the law olfice of Waterman,
Alartin & Hitt, as a student, and was
admitted to the Vermont bar October
21, 1891, fcur days after he had be
come of legal age.
Aleanwhile he had become interest
ed in a quarrying scheme which was
made a dismal failure by fire. Al
though not legally of age at the Lime,
he assumed his share of the obliga
tions and for eight years was In what
he styled Btraitened circumstances.
But at tho end of that time he had
laid dollar for dollar every cent of
tho obligations for which he could not
have been held legally liable. Three
years after being admitted to tho bur
he was elected state's attorney of
Windham county.
In lyOl he was offered tho offico of
federal judge at Cape Nome, Alaska,
at a siilary of $7500 a year, but
promptly declined the offer. The
next year ho began before the Legis
lature his active fight for the develoiv-
ment of the water power of Vermont,
which resulted In tho construction of
the big dam and power house at Ver
non by tho Connecticut River power
company, the first of several similar
developments In southern Vermont.
He was elected town representative
in 1!04 and after three months' serv
ice in that capacity was elected attor
ney-general of the state as the first
incumbent of that otlice, which was
created by the Legislature of which
ho was a member. Ho was re elected
for a second term of two years. This
was his last political otlice. He
