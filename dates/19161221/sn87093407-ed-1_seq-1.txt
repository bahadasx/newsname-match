WILSON'S PEACE NOTE THUS EXPLAINED
WILSON ROVE
HMDS PUCE
President Wilson's note today heralds
peace.
The Star has no patience with those
who cry out that his action favors one side
or the other.
Peace is the important thing—and both
sides are eager for it. I hey are like two
boys who fight, and tight on. hoping some
thing will end the tight, but too proud to
call a halt themselves.
President Wilson makes it easy for both
sides to enter into conference.
They may talk cockily—but at heart
they want an end of the war.
No matter what any of the warring
nations may say NOW. The Star is firmly
convinced that they will confer soon —and
the president's message is hastening the
day mightily.
There is little possibility that the rela
tive positions of the belligerents will change
rKa&riayy in the nett year or two. Wilson's
move, above all. comes after formal peace
talk has been indulged in by both sides. It
comes logically—and with a mighty good
chance for achieving results.

Three more days—and then we shall either have the opportunity of non
partisanship in this state, or shall be denied it.
It rests with you.
During the week there must be 10,000 more names secured in Seattle.
Will this city, which threw overboard the fetters of party slavery, and
rolled up a majority of 12,000 for Woodrow Wilson, fall down at the criti
cal time?
The Star has confidence in Seattle—and in its people. Just a littfc ef
fort on YOUR part will carry this campaign to success.
Success means a free state, with elections devoid of the party bunk and
party label, with primaries in which you can go to the polls without telling
every Tom, Dick and Harry on the election board to which party vou be
long. Remember, you had to tell last September, or you got no ballot.
It's worth while to good citizens, who are not engaged in professional
politics, to wipe out party lines and elect men on their merit instead of their
party label. Will you help? Get a petition and circulate it. Sign the peti
tion, Initiative Bill No. 28, when presented to you. It's your last opportunity
this week.

President's Request for
Peace Guarantees Comes
as Surprise to the World
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.—Plainly hinting that there is danger
of the United States being drawn into the war, Secretary Lansing
today said this was the real reason behind President Wilson's
message to the belligerents, sending of which was announced last
night.
He asked peace terms from all and guarantees for future world
peace.
The situation of the United States as a neutral is rapidly be
coming intolerable, he said. Therefore, the president has de
manded a showdown.
Lansing authorized the following statement as being the real
purpose behind the Wilson message:
"Our rights have been invaded and the situation is becoming
so intolerable that it cannot go on long.
"More and more our rights are invaded by the belligerents
on both sides so that the situation is becoming increasingly criti
cal. I mean by that that we are drawing nearer to the verge of
war and therefore are entitled to know what each belligerei^
Ski in order that we can -future.
"It was iliJt our WlHtelt'
said the situation rmghtf be op me intolerable. We have pros
pered by the war but our rignts have titeen invaafecT."
lonising emphasized positively
that the Herman peace proposal and
the l.loy Mleorge *|<eech had noth
ing to do with the dispatch of the
Wilson note, except, possibly, to
delay sending It.
On this point he authorized a quo
tation. as follows:
"N'o nation ha» been sounded on
thl* inn!t<ir. and we did not know in
advance what Uloyd-Oeorgc would
nay And there was no considera
tion of Uernian overtures the
speech of IJovd-tleorge In connec
tion with the formation,of this note
The only thlug the ileftimn over
turn* did waa, possibly, to delay
the note a few davs
"It was not finally decided to send
this until Monday. The note was
sent Monday night and Tuesday
morning
"The difficulty that faced the
president was that the note might
be const rued as a movement for
peace, and in aid of the German
overture* lie specifically denies
that that wa* a factor in the com
munication Itself"
May Decide the War
Previous to authorizing the above
statement. Ijiinsing had talked more
freely than usual, and In the same
tenor.
It bad been suggested to him that
the I'nlted States really was In no
poaltion to stop the war unless
belligerents themselves desired to
Mid It. to this he hinted that If tUe
I'nltel Stutes were to enter the
war, It would turn the scale decbk
edly, and he emphasized that there
was a feeling of danger that the
country would bf> drawn in.

In the administration'a mind no

Of'both sides was In reality an ef
