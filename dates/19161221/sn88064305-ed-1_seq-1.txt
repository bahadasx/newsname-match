Sunday And Gay-Shattuck
Laws Will Be Enforcel.
It had been rumoted that very
ehortly there would be a eirict en
forcenient of the liquor laws of
the Mtnte in the parish of Ft Tam
many. Investigating as to the
tenth of this rumor, a representa.
tive of the St. Tnmmany Farmer
saelled pen Distriot Attorney
Brock and asked him if the state
ment was true. Mr. Brock stat.
ed that the situation Was such as
compelled action on his part.
There were frequent complaints
of automobile parties coming into
town from prohibition districts,
and at times these Cars were
teoklessly drivan and the occu
pants noley, making it unstife and
tnpleasant for other cars on the
road, espeoially when they were
occupied by ladies. That he c
believed, if the laws were on the 1
statute books they should be en v
forced, and as an officer of the law t
he could not make a distinction I
between saloons and other busi- A
tess. That It was his intention 1
to Write to eaoh saloon-keeper 1,
and notify him of his intention to u
enforce the laws, so that this t
might be considered when license t,
were taken out for the year com
in g. t
It is stated that recently the V
Governor of Mississippi wrote to a
Governor Pleasant of Louisiana, r
complaining of the violation of tl
the Sunday law in a town of St. d
Tammany parish, whereby large t
quantities of liquor found its way C
k into Mississippi towns. This let
ter waa sent to Judge Carter by
Gov, Pleasant and came to the
Y notice of District Attorney Brook.
S So it may be presumed that in
f 1917 there will be no more open.
` ing of saloons on Sunday, nor of
e any places of businPss prohibited
' under the law. Those who want
r to drink on Sundays will have to
'Y bny it some other day. Gamb
ling or other violations of the
law, we presume, will be just as
LSvigorously prosecuted.
. District Attorney frock's posi.
' tion,as we understan4 it. is that
o he, as prosecuting attorney, is
sworn to uphold the law, and that
e he will not shirk his duty in this
1respect.-St. Tammany Farmer.
d
e Editor Era.Leader:
e Herewith e.r;1
e Iclosed find clipping from the St.
e Tammaiiy Farmer of last week
which I hope you will publish, 1
v believe every good citizen of
' Washington Parish will be glad to
Skinow that our District Attorney a
i has determined to force the sa
r loons of St. Tammany Parish to
3 obey the law. Everybody knows
Sthat the local officials, whose du"
· ty it would seem should be to en.
force the Sunday law, have here- .
tofore winked at its violation.
When local authorities refuse to I
Sact then the District Attorney is c
Sright in setting his foot down on t
Sthe matter. It is an every Sun. a
day occurance for cars to pass b
Sthrough this neighborhood to
Covington and return with some
of the party drunk. It should be
stopped. I believe it will be
stopped. Our judge is no less
determined than our district at.
trney for I understand he is
out spoken in his position and
promises .the saloon keeper a
happy time when brought before
him for violating the law. I be
lieve the good people of St. Tam.
many Parish will approve this
course, and God knows we will
stand by our officers.
