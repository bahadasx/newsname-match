Robbers Trailed
Chickens ami hides have been
disappearing in the vicinity of
Huntington fur some time. Tnes
day night the robbers visited the
home of Mage Mmldox one and
one hull miles e.ist of limit itijiton
and took a large supply of both ar
ticles above named. Wednesday
morning Mr. Maddox culled Hunter
Anderson and told him to bring
the blood hounds to his place at
once.
Hunter Anderson was on the
scene with the hounds in a short
time and the hounds readily took
up the trail, going to a negro shack
located about two miles from the
Maddox place. The negroes were
at home, but no confession was
made, but the people in that vicin
ity are satisfied they have the
guilty parties. 1
On every call Hunter has had
lately the hounds have made a ;
successful trail. i
