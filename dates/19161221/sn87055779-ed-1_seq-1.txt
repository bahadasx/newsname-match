LLOYD-GEORGE ID
PAGIFY " IRELAND
International News Service:
LONDON, Dec. 21. That the
Lloyd-George government has de
termined upon a scheme for the
pacification of Ireland is indicated
by developments of the past 24
hours. Following the interpellation
of Henry E. Duke, chief secretary
for Ireland, in the house of com
mons last nisht. it was predicted by
the newspapers today that a major
ity of the Irish prisoners interned
after the Sinn Fein rebellion, will
be released immediately.
There is a strong movement under
way also to have martial law abol
ished in Ireland.
National attention is centered
upon the domestic program of Lloyd
George, pirticularly the mobiliza
tion of the Industrial resources of
the nation.
The Daily Chronicle calls the plan
"bold and very far-reaching." The
government is preparing to appeal
to the whole manhood of the coun
try that is not in the army or en
gaged in work of national import
ance to enroll voluntarily as war
workers. Men between the ages of
17 and 5 are wanted. They must
place themselves at the disposal of

II
International News Service:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. It was recant the United Suites
was being forced nearer and nearer to the brink of war by the out
rageous violations of its rights by all of the European belligerents
that Pres't Wilson addressed his note to them and the other neu
trals. Sec'y of State Lansing made this known in discussing the lan
guage of the note today. Explaining the reference to the fact that
the interference with neutral rights was becoming intolerable the
secretary said:
"It was not so much our material interests that we considered
when the statement was made, but the fact that more and more
our rights have been invaded by the belligerents on both sides. This
now has become so intolerable that it cannot go or. much longer.
4i mean by that that we are drawing nearer to the verge of war
ourselves. Therefore we are entitled to know what each belliger
ent seeks in order that we can regulate our conduct in the future."
Note to Berlin
Being Prepared
International News Service:
LONDON', Dec. 21. The peace
situation has entered a new phase
with the intervention of Pres' Wil
son. The American note is now under
consideration by foreign ctlice oili
cials, having been presented by Am
bassador Pane shortly after he re
ceived it.
Daily cabinet councils are being
held to consider the new develop
ments in the peace situation as they
arise.
News that the American president
has sent a joint note to the belliger
ent powers suggesting that they
state the terms which mip;ht form a
basis for negotiations caused a sen
sation here.
The move of Pres't Wilson lost
none of its force because it . was
written before Premier Lloyd-George
made his preat speech in the bouse
of commons Tuesday afternoon
stating in a broad way the terms of
the allies.
The whole weicht of American
influence has now been thrown
squarely behind the peace move
ment. As America is the mo.-t
powerful of the neutral powers this
influence is naturally of great con
sequtnee. I pect Pope to Act.
Whether the Vatican will follow
the move of Pres't Wilson is now
an unanswered question. Advices
from Rome, however, indicate that
Pope Benedict will overlook noth
ing that will tend to bring the war
to a close.
The American note was cabled to
Walter H. Page, the American am
bassador, on Tuesday and it is be
lieved a reply will be made prompt
ly. The work of preparing the joint
note to (Jermany is under way and
there is a strong probability that it
will be in Berlin before Christmas
day.
The note to Germany will likely
be brief, but. like tbe speech of
Premier Lloyd-George will leave th
way open if Germany desires to
make new peace representat ions l,y
naming her terms.
The note will be siernel by Lord
Robert Cecil, who is acting secre
tary in the absence of A. J. Balfour.
It will be transmitted throueh the
Cnited States government.
Significance is attached to a Reu
ter telegram from Zurich, stating
that full powers to conduct peace
negotiations without further con
sultation have J.een cranted to Dr.
von IV'thmann-Hollweg. the Gor

President Now
To Mark Time
Intem.itloi.al Neva Service;
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. Pres't
Wilson will mark time until he sees
how his peace suestion to the bel
ligerent of Lurope is received. Mean
while American diplomatic repre
sentatives in neutral capitals will be
hard at work in the effort to line
up the neutrals of the world behind
the president's plan fr peae.
It is known that Pres't Wilson al
ready, has sounded out home of the
principal neutrals. Switzerland and
the Scandinavian countries are
earnestly in favor of the administra
tion's plan, made public today. It
was stated in official quarters that
the Influence of those countries,
which, with the United Stats. have
been the chief neutrals to feel the
effects of the Luropean conflict,
will be thrown behind tbe plan of
the president.
To I'oiin Heal OppK.iiion.
Indications received here ate that
Russia and France wjll form the
real opposition to tbe peace proposal.
The administration is relying to a
large extent on Great Britain's In
fluence to win over her principal
allies to a different viewpoint. Other
nations lighting with the entente
will be guided by the action f these
three on both the president's plea
for pe.ice and the Teutonic confer
ence peace proposal, jt is understood
generally here.
Tbe president, before making hi
appeal to the nations of the world,
belligerent and r.eutral alike, sound
ed out the sentiment in belligerent
capitals toward the reception hi
piifestion would -t from the war
ri .g nations.
The president Is convinced, ac
cording to those in his -ontblene.
that there is a far greater sentiment
for peace among all of the belliger
ents than is indicated on the ur
face. Made rareful Mudy.
Careful study h is been made of
the attitude of the warring porwers.
It was stated unofficially today that
the prevent proposal of the presi
dent has been in mind for kout?
time, but that Mr. W:lon waited
until now to offer it because unof
ficial overtures in the past mt with
the reply that a peace proposal then
from the Pnited States oi!d have
been "an emb.tra.-srnerit" 1-ecau. of
the necessity of rejecting It flatly.
The fact that the proposal h.is been
made now indicated in diplomatic
circles that this attitude (,u the par
of the belli gerer.ts has been altere.
greatly if it has not entirely dis
appeared. It was reiterate in official quar
ters here that Germany, as shown
in dispatches- of the past 4S hour.
Is willing to mike large concessions
to bring about a jeae conference.
Statements from Berlin and from
diplomat:; here in the confidence of
the representatives of the central
powers make it positive that th
Teutonic allies are willing to go a
generous half way if th'-ir enemies
will make any move toward accept
ance of the administration's peace
suirgetion. or indicate any wilM:
