WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.—Plainly
Jtlnting that tftere Is danger of the
United States being drawn Into the
_i gar, Secretary of State Lansing today
caid this was the real reason behind
I President Wilson's message to the
belligerents.
The situation of the United States
as a neutral Is -rapidly becoming In
tolerable, he. said. Therefore, the
Resident has demanded a showdown.
"Our rights have been Invaded
and the situation IsT becoming so
^fet^loratole-tlifct 4t «»6*ot go on
teat. i,
"More and more our rights are
invaded by the belligerents on
both sides so that the situation Is
'bpconrlng increasingly critical. I
mean by that, that we are draw
ing nearer to the verge of war,
and therefore are entitled to
know what each 'belligerent seeks
in order that we can ^regulate our
conduct In the future.
"It was our material Interests
that were considered when we
said that the situation' might be
come Intolerable. We have pros
pered by the war, but our rights
have been Invaded."
Lansing emphasized positively that
"the German peace proposal and the
IJoyd-George speech had nothing to
do with the dispatch of the Wilson
note except possibly to delay sending
tt.
On this point he authorized the
^quotation as follows
"No nation has been sounded on
this matter and we did not know
in advance what Lloyd-George,
would say. And there was no con
sideration of German overtures or
the speech of Lloyd-George in con
nection with formation of this
note.
"The only thing the German
overtures did. was possibly to de
lay the note a few days.
"It was not finally decided to
send this uhtil Monday. (The
note was sent Monday night
and Tuesday morning.) The dif
ficulty that faced the president
was that tho note might be con
strued as a movement for peace,
and in aid of the German over
lures. Ho specifically denies
that that was a factor In the com
munication Itself."
Previous Eo authorizing the above
looted statement, Lansing had talked
bOoTft freely than usual and in the
|*ame tenor.
It had been suggested to him that
pile United States really was

EL PASO, Texas, Dec. 21.—With
completion of an Investigation re
vealing a lack of justifiable founda
tion for the protest. General Bell,
Jr., commanding in this district, will
make his decision today as to what
action is to be taken in the cases of
the 580 Ohio national guardsmen
signing the "round robin" protest
against food and camp conditions.
That disciplinary punishment will
be administered to at least the men
who circulated the protest, was stated
in official quarters.
Several non-commissioned officers
who signed the "round rcfoin" will be
reduced to the ranks.
Whether every man signing would
be subjected to discipline has not
/yet been determined by General Bell.
In case action Is decided upon, it
will be In the form of taking certain
privileges and camp leave for a short
period from the men.
An»y Inspectors in charge of the
Investigation found camp conditions
and food of the Ohio guardsmen the
same as in other camps in this dis
trict, with no cause for complaint
They declared the "round robin"
slitimered down to a manifestation of
the men's desire to go home.
Announcement was made from the
district surgeon's office today (that
the number of pneumonia cases in
this district is not alarming. Statis
tics show there have been seventy
nine cases with thirteen deaths, ex
clusive of the Pennsylvania division

sider this a remarkably low death

this afternoon, however, no word of
