President Wilson's Peace Note
I he Set.retarte of State to the American Ambassadors at the (Capitals 0} Belligerent Power*:
DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
WASHINGTON, 1>. C, Dae. 18, 1916,
"The President directs me to send you the fol?
lowing i-ommuni.-ation to be presented immediately
to the Miniater of Foreign Affairs of the govern?
ment tu ?rfaich J*OU are accredited."
The Presid'-nt ?if the United ??-?tates has m
.-tructed me to suggest to the \brre is inserted a
designation of the government addrrAsrd) a course
of action with regard to the presen' war which he
hopea thai the government will take under con?
sideration, a.?? r-uggeste-d, in the most friendly spirit
and as coming not only from a friend, but also as
coning I rum the representative of a neutral nation
who.-e interest-. ha%e been most seriously affected
by the war and whose concern for its early con?
clusion arises out of a manifest necessity to de?
termine how best to safeguard those interests if
'he war is to continue.
Had Plain Long in Mind
it tin* poirtf the tertji vary nlxyhtly. /?, ??,,
itote? to the (Vn'rrr' Potiers this paragraph foUoue
next
The suggestion which I am mstrucU-d to make
'he President has long had it in mind to offer. He
is somewhat embarrassed to offer it at this par?
ticular time, because it may now seerrr to have been
prompte?! by a desire to play a part in connection,
with the recent overtures of the Central Powers.
In the notes <o the Entonta the tvornt "a i?otrt
to pla-j o part ?? ronnsrtion with" are omitted.
The no'es they proved identically i
It has. in fact, been in no way suggested by them
in its origin, and the President would have de?
layed offering it until those overtures had been in?
dependently answered but. for the fact that it also
concerns the question of peace, and may best be
considered in connection with other proposals which
have the same end in view. The President can only
leg that hi** suggestion be considered entirely on
its own merits and as if it had been made in other
circumstances.
The President suggest? tha' an early occasion
It sought (o call out from all the nations now at
?si such an avowal of their respective views as to
the terms upon which the war might be concluded
and the arrangements which would be deemed satis
factory as a guaranty against its renewal or the
kindling of any simi'ar conflict in the future a*
w.ruld make it ?possible frankly to compare them.
Would Be Happy to Serve
He ?a indifferent aa to the mean* taken to arc-nm
pliah this. He would he happy hlmaelf to nerve, or
ever? lo take the initiativ.? in its accomplishment, in
an> way thai might prove acceptable, but he haa no
de-sire to determine th?> method or the mat rnmentalit?
One way will he aa arreptahle to him aa another. If
r.nlr the great object he haa in mind be attained.
He take* the liberty of calling attention to the
fait that the object* which the statesmen of th*
belli-rerents on both sides have in mind in this war
are virtually the same, as stated in general terms
t?> their ?iwii people and to the world.
Kach side ?iesires to make ?he rights and privi?
leges of weak peoples and ?-mall states as secure
against aggression or denial in the future es the
right.s and privileges of the great and powerful
states now at war. Karh wishes itself to be made
secure in the future, along with all other nations
and peopl?*s, against the recurrem-e of wars like
this and acainM aggression or selfish interference
of any kind.
For League of Nations
Kach would be jealoui- of the formation of any
more mal leagues to preserve an uncertain balance
of power amidst multiplying suspicions, but each
?a ready t?> <-'>nsid?*r the formation of a league of
nations to insure peace and justice throughout tha
wnri'i. Before that final r-tep ran be taken, how?
ever, he deems it necessary first to settle the issues
of the present war upon terms which will certainly
safeguard the independence, the territorial integ?
rity and the political and commercial freedom of
the nations involved.
In the measures to he lake-i te aeror? tha? Tatar?
peare of the world the people and government of the
I nited Slate?? are an *. i t a 11 > and a? directly interested
aa the go4ernment?i no? at ??ar. Their interest, more?
over, i the mean? to be adopted to relieve the ?mailer
and wanker peoples of the world of the peril of wrong
and ?iolence i>? hh quick and ardent aa that of any
other people or gmernment. They stand read), and
even eager, to cooperate in the accomplishment of
these end??, ??hen the v?ar is ?hit. ?ith ever? influence
and resource at their command.
Put the war must first be < ?included. The terms
'.pon which it is to be ?.included they aro not at
?iberty to suggest; but the President does feel that
it is his right and his duty to point out their inti?
mate interest in its conclusion, U-st it -hould pres?
ently be !">i late to accomplish the greater things
which lie beyond it-s conclusion, Ie>t the situation of
neutral nations, now exceedingly hard to endure,
be rendered altogether intolerable, and lest, more
than all. an injury be done civilization itself which,
? an never be atoned for or repaired.
The President, therefore, feels altogether justi?
fied in suggesting an immediate opportunity for a
comparison of views as to the terms which must
precede those ultimate arrangements for the peace
of the world, which all desire and in which the
neutral nations as well as those at war are ready
to play their full responsible pan.
Resentment? and Despairs
If the contest must continue to proceed toward
undefined end? In slow attrition, until Ihe million
after million of human l?4es mus? continue to be
offered up until on one side or the other there are
no more to offer; If resentments must be kindled that
ran never cool and despairs engendered from which
(here can he no recovery, hopes of peace and of the
willing concert of free peoples will be rendered vain
and idle.
The life of the entire world has. been profoundly
affected. Kvery part of the great family of man?
kind has felt the burden and terror of this unprece?
dented contest of arms. No nation in the civilized
world can be said in truth to stand outside its in?
fluence or to be safe against, its disturbing effects.
And yet the concret? objects for which it is being
wapod have never been definitively stated.
The leaders of the several belligerents have, as
has been said, stated those object.? in general term-.
But, stated in general terms, they seem the same
on both sides. Never yet have the authoritative
spokesmen of either side avowed the precise ob?
jects which would, if attained. satisfy them and
their people that the war had been fought out.
The world has been left to conjecture what ??efinitive
results, what actual exchange of guarantees, what
political or territorial changes or readjustment-,
what stage of military succ?s-, even, would bring
the war to an end.
Thinks Peace May Be Near
It may be that peace 11 nearer than we know;
that the terms upon which the belligerents on flic
one side and on the other would deem it necessary
to insist are not so irreconcilable as some have
feared; that an interchange of vifsjra would clear
the way at least for conference and make the per?
manent concord of the nations a hope of the imme?
diate future, a concert of nations immediately prac
tieable.
The President is not proposing peace; he ia not even
offering mediation. H<* is merely proving that
soundingr- l>e taken in order that we may learn,
the neutral nations with the Ivelligerent, how ti?-ar
the haven of peace may be for which all mankind
longs with an intense and increasing longing, lie
believes that the spirit in which he speaks and the
objects which he seeks will be understood by all
concerne?!, an?! he confidently h??pes for a responso
which will bring a new light into the affairs of the
world

CONFERENCE NOW CERTAIN,
VIEW OF VON BERNSTORFF
Critics of the President Declare That He Either
Fears Being Drawn Into War Through "Fright
fulness" Campaign Suggested in Berlin or
Seeks Fame as Mediator
i rfrom The Tribune Bureiu. |
Washington, Dec. 20.?President Wilson has thrown the
i weight of American influence behind the effort now being made
by Germany to bring about a discussion of peace.
A note he addressed to all the belligerent nations, which
was dispatched from Washington on .Monday night, is regard
|ed in all quarters?by Teuton and Entente embassies and by
neutrals, official and unofficial?as a distinct and strong rein
forcement of the German position.
Declaring that "the concrete objects for which the war is
, being waged have never been definitely stated" the President
proposes that "an early occasion be sought to call out from all
the nations now at war an avowal of their respective views as
to the terms upon which the war might be concluded."
At the German Embassy there was no concealment of the
; great satisfaction caused by the President's action. Count von
? Bernstorff said : "Now I am positive there will be a peace
! conference."
In the embassies of the Entente powers a different feeling
?was encountered. There it was distinctly felt and stated that.
'whatever Mr. Wilson's good intentions, the unmistakable
i fact was that his action was a direct reinforcement of the Ger?
man position.
VEILED THREAT OF UNITED STATES ACTION
In Entente circles particular emphasis was laid upon a pas?
sage of the note in which a veiled threat was discerned. This
! passage asserted the right of the United States to interest itself
j in peace proposals at this time "lest the situation of neutral
. nations. DOW exceedingly hard to endure, be rendered altogether
intolerable." The interpretation plainly in the minds of En?
tente sympathizers is that the United States may take means
of its own to force a conclusion of the war.
It can be stated upon the authority of the State Department
that the American government did not inform itself before
sending the note that its suggestions for a discussion of peace
would be welcomed by Great Britain and her allies. On the
other hand, it was stated at the German Embassy that the
United States had been aware e\er since the exchange of Sussex
notes that its offices would be welcomed by Germany.
President Wilson's peace note, in its essentials, was pre?
pared several weeks ago. He has be?>n looking for the psycho?
logical opportunity for making it public, and, in fact, was on
the verge of sending it when Germany anticipated him. The
note was then withheld for fear of complications.
Mr. Wilson and his advis*ers hesitated. After the Cabinet
meeting on Friday last the representative.?- of every important
newspaper in the United States were authorized, in the very
presence of Mr. Wilson, to state that this government had no
peace move in contemplation.
NOTE SIGNED LATE MONDAY EVENING
As late as Monday noon, speaking to the same correspond?
ents, he deprecated newspaper discussion of any sort, fearing
that speculation as to the possibility of American participation
in the peace movement might agitate and unsettle a very deli?
cate situation. The correspondents left the White House with
the certain belief that up to that hour the United States gov
?-rnment had no intention of doing more than transmit the Ger?
man peace offer.
Vet only six or eight hours later th?* note was sent, th?
introduction of it having been changed to meet present condi?
tion*?. It was signexi late in the evening and dispatched from
the te.pgraph room in the State Department early Tuesdav
morning. If the President's mind was made up on Friday and
as late as Monday noon, equaling with his statements to the
newspaper men. something happened or some information was
brought to him that made him reverse himself. What that was
is as yet unknown here. If information was brought to him,
certainly it did not come through th?> regular ?liplomatic
channels.
Amazement il expressed hero that the President did not
wait for the delivery of the Lloyd George speech. It was aft-ar
it had been explained to Ambassador von Bernstorff that th?
American note was on the wires long before the British Premier
began his speech in Parliament and that nothing was known
