EN
To the Officers and Members of the
Oregon Wool Growers:
Greeting:
Another year has passed away,
another milestone in the lives of men
and a year of unbounded prosperity
to the Wool Growers throughout the
world. We have met once more to
transact our annual business, adjust
our grievances, if any, and and com
mingle again in a social way with our
fellow men. Therefore as President
of this Association, It is incumbent
upon me to present to you the usual
report, or address which I am happy
, ta say will not be long or burden
some. The wonderful prosperity of
the business, the record breaking
prices for both wool and mutton, and
the bountiful supply of forage on our
ranges has brought about conditions
such as never existed before in our
history. The manner in which both
wool and mutton have advanced hy
, leaps and bounds has been astonish
ing to us all; and under such con
ditions it is needless to say the sheep
men have been prosperous and fr
once seem to be satisfied with their
v lot. Because, during the past year
your President and Secretary have
not received a single communication
of complaint from any member ot
this Association. -
Such wonderful prosperity that
exists today as compared to some ten
years ago seems too good to be true,
and the silver lining that seemed
so badly obscured by the cloud at
that time seems now to have broad
ened out so as seemingly to have lett
no cloud at all. And it we could be
assured that the same silver lining
would forever shine as it does at the
present time there would be no more
use tor this Association, which J, am
sorry to say has been allowed to drift
almost ashore on the waves of our
prosperity. This organization which
has been a help and protection to us
all in the past should not be allowed
to go to pieces for the want of a
little moral and financial support.
We are living in a fools paradise
The bloody scourge of Europe, the
wanton waste of life and prosperity
Is in a large measure the cause of
our prosperity; every dollar we are
receiving for our wool and mutton
above its normal value is wrested .
from the life-blood of our fellowman.
Men are daily dielng by the thousands
and women and children are starv
ing by the millions and being robbed
of their birthright to satisfy the crav
ings of wars awful lust. What ron
amongst us, no matter how much
we love the almighty dollar, who
would not gladly go back to normal
prices for our products if by so do
ing this horrible and useless slaugh
ter would cease? God grant that it
may soon cease. And when it does,
tyrannical monarchs and musty
thrones will soon pass never to return
and all men from the uttermost cor
ners of the earth will proclaim the

LUPINE PROVES TO BE
A POISONOUS PLANT
By W. H. Lytle, State Veterinarian
There can no longer be any doubt
about the cause of sheep losses in and !
around Heppner. The four sheep that
were put through the experiment at
the Fair Pavilion during the Oregon
Wooigrowers' convention proved the
plant Lupine to be capable of poison
ing sheep. One out of the four sheep
piacea in a pen in which this plant
was thrown developed typical symp
toms and died at the end of the sec
ond day. The symptoms exhibited
were those of Lupine poisoning, Just
the same as is seen on the range.
There being great weakness, refusal
of food, head held low, excessive ur
ination, trembling, spasms and
clamping of the jaws.
It developed and further proved
the fact that sheep fed on alfalfa are
less apt to be poisoned. Alfalfa be
longs to the same botanical family
and naturally the eating of it would
tend to lessen the susceptibility to the
poisonous alkaloid found ln the lu
pine plant during certain seasons of
the year and during certain years.
As yet no really effective after
treatment has been found for treat
ing sheep already poisoned. Mr.
Frank Moaahan used a quantity of
glauber salts, about a handful to each
sheep, dissolved in water and along
with it about one dracm of crude
eurotropine. He reports all poison
ed sheep to have recovered that were
treated.
As a precaution owners who have
lost sheep should gather the plant
from the range or not use the range
until they have proven the same to be
free from danger. By allowing a
small number of the sheep to graze
on suspicious ranges, will prove
whether the danger has gone, without
exposing the' owner to larger losses.
Heavy Mail Now.
Postmaster Richardson reports
that both the outgoing and incoming
mails are exceptionally heavy at this
time, caused by the Christmas rush.
This Thursday morning saw the larg
est amount of mail going from the
local postofflce since Mr. Richardson
has been in charge. There were 28
hand packed bags. As Christmas
approaches it is easily to be seen that
this will be greatly increased. Ow
ing to the fact that eastern mail
trains have been snow bound the past
few days, there has been no mail
received from that section of the
country. When this mail gets through
it simply means that the local office
will be swamped.
TRAP SHOOT SUCCESSFUL
The trap shoot held in this city
last Sunday under the auspices of
the local rod and gun club was an
unqualified success. A large num
ber of outside men were here, visitors
coming from Echo, Arlington, Con
don, lone and Lexington.
Prizes were awarded in the form
of turkeys and geese. The success of
the affair is" due largely to Harold
and Henry Cohn, Dr. R. J. Vaughan
and B. R. Patterson. It is contem
plated to have a number of meets ln
the near future and from the interest
taken on this initial occasion, it is
safe to predict that the visitors will
come agan, bringing more of their
friends with them.
T. 0. Denlssee, local contractor, Is
making some extensive improvements
to the T. J. Humphreys, residence in
west Heppner.
H. W. Hicks, traveling passenger
agent for the O-W. R. & N. Co.,
came up from Portland to attend the

GROWERS HAD BEST
MEET IN HISTORY
Two Dara fiestsoa In This City Last
Week Fraaght With Bosiaess
Growers Oppose More Than
BO Par Cent Increase
In Grazing Fees.
The most successful meeting of
the Oregon Wooigrowers' since that
organization was established 19 years
ago, was held in this city last week,
It was the most Important meeting
In its history, Inasmuch as there
were matters of vital importance com
lng up.
President Barrett's address, which
we publish in full In this issue, out
lined pretty nearly the position of
the Woolmen on the issues coming
before- the convention. The address
was a masterpiece and has brought
forth a world of favorable comment.
The convention headquarters were
ln the Palace hotel and the meetings
were held in the opera house. The
official program opened on Friday
morning at lOo'clock with an address
of welcome by 8. E. Notson, Mayor,
on behalf of the city of Heppner,
His address was responded to by Sen
ator J. N. Burgess, manager of the
Cunningham Sheep ft Land Company
and one of the most extensive wool
growers of the Northewest. Sena
tor Burgess recalled with much plea
sure, the meeting of the sheepmen in
Heppner eight years ago. It was from
that time that the real progress of
the association really dates, accord
lng to Mr. Burgess; for it was Hepp
ner that first introduced the social
phase into the meetings. A better
feeling has existed ever since.
One of the features of the conven
tion was the demonstration of lupine
poisoning of sheep. This demon
stration was conducted by Dr. W. H
Lytle, state veterinarian. Four sheep
were fed the plant and one of them
died. The flockmasters considered
this ample evidence of what has been
causing their losses. Dr. David N,
Roberg of the state board of health
is now working on an antidote to
serVeas an off set for the poison. Dr.
Lytle has an article in this issue re
garding the demonstration.
tonsiaeraoie discussion was
brought forth over the proposed in
crease of grating fees upon the na
tional forests. General opposition
was manifest When the resolutions
committee brought in their report
favoring a fifty per cent increase in
stead of the proposed 100 per cent
increase, the woolmen went on record
at once as favoring the resolution.
O. M. Plummer of Portland held
the interest of the growers for seve
ral minutes Saturday morning while
talking on "How to Get the Most Out
of Life." Mr. Plummer is a staunch
supporter of the women and children
and he advocated better living condi
tions for them on the farm. His ad
dress met with hearty applause.
In his address on "Rabies" Dr.
David N. Roberg, secretary of the
state board of health discussed the
disease and made proposals for leg
islation which will look to a means
for stamping it out. He said that in
some respects it looked to him like
the present bounty law was a failure
in that the work done was not effi
cient. He believes that more money
spent with the Biological Survey will
get better results. Much discussion
followed Dr. Roberg's address, Sena
tor Burgess leading the discusison
favoring the continuance of the boun
ty law.
Others whe addressed the conven
tion were, Dr. Lytle, J. H. Dobbin of
Enterprise and President Barratt.
At the conclusion of the two days
session, W. B. Barratt was re-elected
president for another year, Ernest
Johnson of Enterprise, vice president
and J. O. Hager of Heppner, secretary
and treasurer. It was decided to
hold the next convention in The
Dalles.
A fitting climax to the convention
was the banquet at the Palace Grill
on Saturday evening when manager
E. J. Wood placed a banquet before
the 125 guests of the Heppner Com
mercial Club. Hon. T. J. Mahoney
was toastniaster and several promi
nent men, including visitors and local
men made short talks. It was a fitt
ing end to a successful event.

The Morrow County Fair has gain
ed marked recognition over the North
west. This has been demonstrated
on more than one occasion in the
past, when our exhibits have won
first, second and third awards in
State fairs and land product shows.
The most recent recognition comes
from the Oregon Agricultural Col
lege.
In a recent letter received by
secretary W. W. Smead, W. S. Brown
of the entension service ot the state
college has asked Mr. Smead to lead
ln the discussion on the subject "Im
provements suggested in our present
methods of classification." This
will be one of the subjects up for dis
cussion at the conference of county
and community fairs, said conference
to be held in Corvallis during Far
mers' Week, of January.
The letter reads as follows:
Corvallis, Ore., Dec, 12, 1916.
Mr. W. W. Smead,
Heppner, Oregon.,
Dear Sir:
We are planning what we believe
will be a strong program for our con
ference of County and community
fairs this year. The conference will
meet on Wednesday afternoon, Janu
ary 4, during Farmers' Week. The
keynote of the conference is the im
provement in fair methods. The
first subject on the program is one
which I have been asked to take. It
follows: "Improvement suggested
in our present methods of classifica
tion." I should like to have you act as
one of the leaders ln the discussion of
this important subject. From my ex
perience at the Moro fair, I judged
that you will be very well qualified
to speak upon this subject. You
will have about ten minutes at your
disposal in discussing the question.
I certainly hope you can be with
us to enjoy Farmers' Week and ap
pear on this program. Kindly let
me know at your earliest convenience
whether or not I may depend upon
you. v
Yours very truly.
W. S. BROWN.
EWISH to call the attention of the Ladies of
Heppner and Vicinity to the fact that, after Jan
uary 1st I will, in connection with my millinery es
tablishment, have a Miss Phillips, who is a profes
sional dress maker and a thoroughly competent designer.
I SOLICT YOUR PATRONAGE.
Thanking my patrons for their liberal patronage
during the past year and wishing you all a Merry
Christmas and a Happy New Year, I am,
Yours truly,
