OR. M. CAMP KILLED
When Auto Ran Off a Bridge Near
Kellerton Sunday Evening, His
Skull Being Crushed in.
Dr. Matt Camp, the well known
Kellerton physician, was instantly
killed in an auto accident Sunday ev
ening about 5 o'clock, which occur
red at a small bridge over Cow a
creek, about 2% miles northeast ot
Kellerton, and Just over the line in
Ringgold county, when an auto driv
en by Lew Rominger, of Kellerton,
struck the bridge and went over it to
the bottom of the creek below.
Dr. Camp owned a farm a few
mires northeast of Kellerton and had
driven there with Mr. Romlnger to
show him some pasture he had tor
sale. Mr. Rominger was driving a
new Ford touring car. which he had
owned but a short time. Dr. Camp
was riding in the front seat with him,
and it was just getting dark. Just
as they approached the bridge Dr.
Camp cried out to Rominger to look
out there was a horse, and a loose
horse appeared in front of the car.
In making a quick turn to try and
avoid striking the horse Mr. Romin
ger struck tne side of the small
bridge and the car went over the side
ot the bridge, turning over twice
and falling right side up, and when
Rominger came to himself he was
still sitting in the car with his hands
on the steering wheel, but the en
gine had been killed. He immediate
ly called to Dr. Camp and getting no
reply went to him and found he was
dead. He walked about three-quar
ters of a mile and phoned to Keller
ton for assistance.
It, was found that Dr. Camp must
have been struck by the car as it fell,
•his nose being broken, his neck dis
located, and the whole top of his
head crushed, so tha-t his brain was
exposed. Mr. Rominger had his nose
broken and was bruised on the chest,
but not seriously.
Dr. Camp was almost 67 years of
age, and had been/a practicing physi
cian at Kellerton for 40 years. He
had never married, and was of a fam
ily of eleven children, of which six.
sisters and one brother, with the
aged mother survive. His brother,
Of. Marsh Camp, of Decatur City,
died about two years ago, and a sis
ter, the mother of Guy Connor, of
Leon, passed away about a year ago,
making three deaths in the family
within two years.
Funeral services were held at Kel
lerton Tuesday afternoon in charge
of the Masonic lodge, of which Dr.
Camp had been a prominent member
lor many years.
Looks Like Tliey Were Buncoed.
Along last spring a smooth tongu
ed Individual representing-the Lewis
Fowler Advertising Co., of Des
Moines, came to Leon and interested
the pastors of the Leon churches in
securing a big free sign on which
the words "Go to Church" were to
be painted. He was a very smooth
individual, working for the cauls',
and all he hoped to get out of do
nating the sign, was that his firm
could sell the space to some national
advertiser after the expiration of the
three year contract to. advertise the
religious movement for the benefit
of the churches. It looked good for
the churches on the face of his rep
resentations, and the pastors assist
ed him in getting twelve•' business
firms to agree to pay the cost of fur
nishing the electricity to illuminate
the sign, and twelve firms signed an
agreement which now turns up in the
shape of a promissory note each firm
agreeing to pay $9.15 every six
months for a period of three years,
making a total of $54.90 each, or a
grand total of 1658.80. Not'satisfied
with this the smooth promoter in
duced the Leon Electric Co., to do
nate one year's lighting, which left
him over $500 for his work in solic
iting the Leon, firms and putting up
-the sign, and as he closed up the
deal in a couple of days he made a
pretty fair profit, as one of the firms
which was caught by the graft wrote
to the Thomas Cusack Sign Co.. of
Chicago, and asked them what they
would erect such a sign and maintain
\it for three years, and they replied
ey wonld erect it, repaint it onee
each year, and maintain it for 172.00
a year, a total of 1216.00 for three
vnarH
the top of Harris Bros.' marble block
on the north side of the square, and
the names of the firms who pay for it
appears in small letters on one cor
ner, which a person would have to
get afield glass to read at any dis
tance. The Leon Ainisters who were
induced to lend their aid to the
scheme naturally feel that they were
imposed upon and are. mighty sorry
they had anything to do with it, but
the fellow came to Leon with creden
tials from ministers at other places
endorsing the scheme and they sup
posed it was alright.
The smooth promoter made a
whirlwind campaign in Iowa and suc

A Word With Our Subscribers.
It is hardly necessary to say any
thing in regard to the enormous in
crease in the cost of publishing *a
newspaper -which has qome upon the
publishers during the present year.
This week we paid $140 a ton for
print paper, which a year ago we
bought for $44.00. Just t^ink of
what this increase means to The Re
porter. The blank paper in each
paper costs us almost as much as the
price we receive from our subscribers
for the printed paper. Just how
we can stand this added expense
we do not know. We have not as
yet increased the subscription price
to The Reporter, but unless some re
lief is obtained soon, we will be com
pelled to do one of two things. We
will either have to increase *he sub
scription price of The Reporter, or
we will have to reduce tne size of
the paper to not more than eight
pages. We hate to do either one,
and have been holding off in the
hope that print paper would go down
to somewhere near a reasonable
Souses
rice, but at present the paper
give very little hope for any
reduction in price during the com
ing year.
We don't want to take advantage
of any subscriber, and we will con
tinue to accept subscriptions at the
regular rate of $1-50 per year. If
your subscription expires with the
new year we ask you to renew at
once. This wiM insure your receiv
ing the paper at the old rate, but we
cannot guarantee this rate for any
length of time. You had better take
advantage of the offer right now and
renew. We are not attempting to
frighten our readers into making re
newals but are simply stating the
cold facts to you. You can pay for
one or more years at the $1.50 rate
if you do so now. It's up to our
subscribers.

Many Are Saving.
Leon's pioneer Christmas Savings
Club started by the Exchange Nation
al Bank is receiving liberal support.
It seems nearly every one wants
to start saving money. This is the
proper thing to do. As Americans
we Tiave been too free spenders. We
haTO lived toO~mucli from one day to
the next, so to speak, without
thought of the future.
The high cost, of living may go
some lower, but it will be eventual
ly much higher. In the last. forty
years land in Decatur county has
gone from $10 to $150 per acre.
What will the next forty years bring
about?. Better look to the future!
Wheff the war is over there is
bound to be an over supply of labor
(so much capital has been destroy
ed), wages will go down. Unemploy
ed labor reduces consumption which
tends to throw other labor out of
employment. We are bound to have
some lean years, You ihust expect
this. Get ready by starting to save.
Start with our Christinas Savings
Club. Start now.

Auto Turned Over.
While descending the hill near the
Glass Finch farm east of Leon on
Tuesday evening of last wfek, E.
Gammon's auto, in which were his
wife, and their daughter, Mrs. Levi
Virden and children, of Kellerton,
skidded with Mr. Gammon, and as
there was a big ditch on one side, he
allowed it to slide into a smaller
ditch and it turned over. All of the
occupants were jolted up, but none
injured-except Mrs. Gammon, who
received a number of painful bruises.
The top being up protected them con
siderably and they are thankful it
was no worse. Tne -principal dam

JEFFKIJSOX HIGHWAY CONTRO
VERSY.
lights of Corydon and Chariton to
Use Name for Side Trail May
Get Into Court.
There promises to be some litiga
tion over the use of the name "Jeffer
son Highway," by boosters of Chari
ton and Corydon who claim to have
located the Jefferson Highway from
Kansas City to Des Moines through
these towns, while the official Jeffer
son Highway was located over the
inter-state Trail, which passes
through Leon, according to the fol
lowing which appeared last week in
the Des Moines Register:
Citizens of Chariton and Corydon
in Lucas and Wayne counties are in
bad with the officers of the Jeffer
son Highway Association and may
face court action. The trouble is
over the route the higWway be
tween Kansas City and Des JYioines.
Liast February at a meeting of the
Highway officers in Kansas City, an
official route was selected. It was
deciaen to accept bodUy the old In
ter-State Trail as the official highway.
The rdute adopted by the associa
tion goes from Kansas City to St. Joe
and then by wajy of Bethany, Lamo-
ni, Leon, Osceola and Indianola to
Des Moines.
The opponents of this route fa
vored the trail through Chillicothe,
Mo., and Chariton and Corydon,
Iowa.
When the officials rejected this
route, it apparently did not please
the Chillicothe, Chariton and Cory
don citizens as they have insisted on
advertising that they are on the Jef
ferson Highway.
The laws of Iowa provide that the
name of a road or trail can be regis
tered which prevents its wrongful
use. Harry H. Polk of Des Moines,
a director in the Highway, registered
the Highway in the state a year ago,
and the claims of the Chariton and
Corydon people are considered in
fringements by officials.
James, F. Harvey, of Leon, who is
also a director of the highway, is
taking exception to the claims of the
two Iowa towns and he has written
Mr. Polk about it. In his letter he
.states that the citizens in the two
towns are asserting-that when the
new blue book—the official road reg
ister—is issued,"it will contain the
iilfornlation that Chariton and Cory
dote are.pn the train.
What action may be taken by the
directors of the highway has not
been definitely decided, but the
courts may be resorted to.
Tlte High Cost of Print Paner.
The print gapfer situation at the
present time seems to be that the
daily, newspapers are taking almost
the entire output of the paper mills
at a slight advance over former
prices and that the weekly papers all
over the country are being compelled
to pay exorbitant prices for an inad
equate supply. The daily papers are
buying news print paper at the pres
ent time on new yearly contracts for
|2.35 to 12.55 oer hundred pounds,
while the weeklies are being forced
to pay 6 cents, 7 cents and even as
hign as 8 cents for the same quality
Eouses
aper. The mills and wholesale
are exhibiting the greatest in
difference to the necessities of the
weekly press, and should the present
conditions continue indefinitely, then
thousands of weekly newspapers in
the country will be forced into bank
ruptcy, which means extinction. The
better class of weeklies will have to
go to book paper, or get under the
sheltering wing of a patent-inside

TWENTYFIVE YEARS AGO
Items Taken from the files of Tbe
Reporter Published a Quarter
of a Century Ago.
Miller Chandler, teacher of White
Oak school, three miles northwest of
Leon, had an experience with one of
his pupils last week which he will
not soon forget. For some offense of
the rules of the school he whipped
Cora Rumley, the seventeen year old
daughter of Charles Rumley. It
seems he wielded the rod with more
force than was necessary, drawing
blood in several places. An informa
tion was filed before Justice Al
baugh, charging him with assault
and battery, and the case was set for
Itial Monday. Before the trial com
menced however, the case was settled
by Chandler paying the girl $50 for
personal injury, and also paying all
the costs in the case, so that the
whipping coSt him over $100.

IDLE HOUR SPECIALS.
Three Big Attractions ISooked For
the Coming Week.
The Idle Hour theatre' has booked
three extra big attractions for the
coming week, of more than ordinary
merit. On Friday Mary Pickford ap
pears in her new nlay, "Less Than tne
Dust," written by Hector TurnbullK
and presented by the Artcraft Pic
tures Corporation.
•In her new May, "Less Than the
Dust," Mary Pickford has the role
of a» little castaway of English birth
who has been reared among natives
of the lowest caste of India. The
scenes are all laid in Indian and Eng
land and are remarkably faithful
pictures of both lands in scenic sets
of great beauty and wondrous effect.
One of the scenes shows a street with
its shops and bazaars and all of tne
color and ever changing views of an
eastern thoroughfare. Another shows
the British garrison. Then there is a
great stone temple and the pool of
the sacred waters while another ef
fective picture is made of a storm in
the desert and there is a battle be
tween the natives and British troopB.
The story is full of dramatic force
and Miss Pickford's part is a blend
ing of the delightful cQmedy, win

The feature for Christmas day is
Marguerite Clark as "Helene of the
North.'"a Paramount feature play.
Marguerite Clark's latest screen
characterization, "Helen of the
North," presents this dainty star Da
the most unique impersonation she
has yet assumed since her first trium
phant association with the motion
picture art. The subject combines {p
a decidedly novel manner the cultur
ed atmosphere of aristocratic society
circles with the rugged environtneikt
of the trackless wastes of northwest
ern Canada. Between these far ex
tremes, the drama sways with'jinin
terrupted fascination, whether in-the
limitless wilds, or the warm, luxur
ious drawing room, Marguerite Clark
is equally effective and appealing,
and as the central character of this
unique dramatic romance, she attains
a greater success than any pt her
previous screen triumphs.
Matinee at 8 o'clock, admission -10
cents. First night show at 7:15, ad
mission 10 and 15 cents.
