CAMPBELL GETS
HIS CERTIFICATE
Refusal of Admission at the
Governor's Office Will
Start New Legal Fight.
Phoenix, Ariz, Dec. 21. Secretary
Osborn has Issued to Tom Campbell
a certificate of election as governor of
Arizona, on the face of the returns.
Campbell will qualify, take the oath
and present himself next Monday at
the governor's office, where it is be
lieved he will be refused possession.
Then will be started an action In man
damus. This hardly will have a speedy
termination, as legal proceedings will
continue, to determine the validity of
Campbell's apparent majority of about
30. Much of this was stipulated this
morning.
Attorney Says Campbell In GoTernor.
According to attorneys Sloan and
Billiard, "Until a Judgment of court
that Hunt is elected. Campbell Is gov
ernor. It does not matter In the least
whether he sits in the executive cham
bers at the capitoL He may have a
lesal office down town."
It is probable that next Monday Ari
zona will have a dual set of officials.
Further complication comes In the
fact that the legislature meets Janu
ary 8 with two governors claiming
recognition. Possibly the conservative
Democrats of the body, with ten Re
publican votes, may recognize Camp
bell. AIRPLANE ROYALTY FIGHT

GERMANS LOSE
HOPEOF PEACE
Newspapers Comment With
out Enthusiasm on Lloyd
George's Speech.
Berlin, Germany, By way of London),
Dec 2L The Berlin press expresses lit
tle surprise at the British premier's at
titude toward peace, although most
wonder why he believes that entering
Into a conference would involve the
entente as placing Its head in a noose.
Uoyd George's references to resti
tution and reparation are universally
Interpreted as an entente demand that
Germany surrender all occupied terri
tory and probably pay an indemnity.
The Tageblatt says:
"Lloyd George is not willing to ne
gotiate, or willing only In case that
Germany will submit to England's de
mands as summarized in his utterances
regarding restitution, reparation, and
guarantee. This makes the chasm be
tween the English and German stand
point so broad that not even the most
cheerful optimist can find a way to
bridge it. Lloyd George, in stipulating
the acceptance of his condition before
the opening of negotiations, shows that
ho does not wish to negotiate."
In the view of the Vossiche Zeltung, T
more than a recognition by England of
Germany's strength and the failure of
the entente's military enterprises. It
adds that not a single word of Lloyd
George's speech Indicates any desire to
repair the torn threads and asks why
the entente should stand so stubbornly
lor restitution and reparation, when
it is highly improbable that Alsace can
ever be conquered by France or Con
stantinople by Russia, and that It Is
even Improbable that Germany can be
driven out of the conquered territory.
The Vossiche Zeitung contends that it
Is a fortunate thing that Germany pos

The Kreuz Zeitung is flatly pessimis
tic "We havinow learned." It says,

foreign office and now is under consid

WASHINGTON", D. C. Dec 2L
While president Wilson's mes
sages sent Tuesday, urging the
belligerents of Europe to enter upon
the discussion of peace terms were be
ing received today in European capi
tals, It was stated that president Wil
son, is relyins upon public opinion br
other neutral nations to add force to
his efforts to clarify the situation.
While the American government acted
entirely on Its own responsibility.
I nations, for economic reasons, are
ta"y Interested in the outcome.
i, was stated authoritatively today
that the president acted only on assur
ances that his move would be favor-
ably received by the entente allies, as
well as by the central powers. He
took the position, it was said, how
ever, that his note calls for replies and
that even though unfavorable, the re
sponses would tend to make clear the
objects of the belligerents and estab
lish some common ground.
Dangerous Position of X. S.
The danger of the United States It
self being drawn into the war, by
reason of Its increasingly critical posi
tion as a neutral, was one of the mov
ing considerations in president Wil
son's dispatch of the notes.
Secretary of state Lansing today au
thorized the statement that the ma
terial rights or the United States had
not been the paramount consideration.
America's rights, he said, were being
more and more involved bv the bel
ligerents and that as the United States
was "drawing nearer the erge of
war." It was entitled to know exactly
what each belligerent seeks. "In order
that we may regulate our conduct in
the future."
l.ansinca Statement.
Secretary Lansing authorized the
following statement:
"The reasons for the sending of the
note were as follows:
"It is not our material interests we
had in mind when the note was bent,
but more and more our own rights
are becoming involved by the belli
gerents on both sides, so that the sit
uation is becoming increasingly crltl
caL "I mean by that, that we are draw
ing nearer the verge of war ourselrej
and therefore we are entitled to know
exactly what each belligernt seek"
In order that we may regulate our
conduct ia the future.
"Xo nation has been sounded. No
consideration of the German overtures

taken into account in th. fAn.ni.

It until Monday. Of course, the dif-t-culties
that face the president were
fiat it might be construed as a move
ment toward peace, and in aid of the
t.erman overtures. He specifically de
nies that that was the fact in the docu
ment itself."
May Force Earlier End of War.
Lansing further said:
'The sending of this note will in;.
cste the possibility of our oeing forced,
into the war. That possibilitv ouirhr
to serve as a restraining and sobering
m'lt, American rights.
It may also serve to force an earlier
conclusion of the war. Neither the
president nor myself regard this note
as a peace rote. It Is merely an ef
fort to get the belligerents to define
tee end for which they are fighting."
The president's notes had been prac
tically 4S hours on their way today
and officials believed they had reached
all the foreign capitals.
