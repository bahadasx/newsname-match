Mr Coldwaterand family have been
residents of this county for a number

proved He was wide-awake, ener
getic and a hard worker; n man who
sUod high In the estimation of his
friends and neighbors, nnd who was
strictly honest, honorable and a man
of influence for good and higher Ideals
among his associates. His home lite
was one of his most admirable quail
ities. He loved his home and his fam
ily, and his first thotlgh't was for them,
kh was evidenced by the spl.ndid farm
home and tint improvements which ho
provided for their comfort and the
pride ho took in making home attract
ive and convenient. The wife and

well attended and those who heard the

TilE WOMAN IN CONGRESS.
It is within possibility that the worn-
Laneleeted from Montana to represent
rftJst'Btate in Congress may hold the
f uslnnee of power for the whole nation.
Congress is tvery evenly divided be
tween the Democrats and Republicans.
If Miss Rankin should deotde to cham
pion a measure outside of party lines,
her action might decide the whole leg
islation. Never before has any woman
Jn the United States been placed in
tuch a position of power.

BIG TIME AT THE CIRCUS
Tne "Silly Circus," which was given
by the teachers of the grade sohool,
Saturday evening, to raiBe fundi to pay
for a piano for the new grade building,
was well patronized and much enjoyed
by all. The proceeds of tho evening
were about IGOOO which will add ma
terially to the fund. The "Circus"
was one of the best "etuuts" that has
been given in Beaver ..for some time
and afforded plenty of amusement and
harmelesa fun for old as well as young.
Of course everybody had to go, as us
ual, to "take the children to the cir
cus." Among the features of the
evening was a Minstrel Show, In -which
a number of our leading citizens play
ed the role of "Coon" to perfection.
Tho Side Shows were also the sourco of
much fun. , II. M. Bulick, as "Uncle
Josh" and Cliff Drum as the green
country boy, certainly took the cako
for make-up and created no small
amount of, tbe fun of the evening.
Altogether, the "Circus" was a most
enjoyable affair, both, financially and
socially, and tho teachers are to bo
congratulated for their effort.
Auctioneer Williams reports a good
alio at J. L. King's this week. A mare.
bought- last spring for $100, brought
115. and her colt $.'.1.00, Cows sold
for 85 and $00, and yearlings for C2
