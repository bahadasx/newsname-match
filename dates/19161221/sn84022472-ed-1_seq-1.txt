of 125 Huntington road, a young Rus
sian, is going to stick to dancing the
mazurka for pastime,
The disastrous ending of Skirrnint's
party and the robbery and assault,
created great excitement for those in
the vicinity of the scene, early last
night but none of the witnesses
thought to take the number, of the
automobile with the result that the
police have thus far" failed to learn
the identity of the hold-up men.
Skirmint has been in this country
a short time. He is employed as a
filer in the Russian department of the
Remington Arms Co., and claims also
to 'be in the employ of the Russian
consul. Yesterday afternoon, he got
$250 which haJd been sent him by the
Rujsian consul from New York, at
the local post off ice.he states.
With the money that he had, his
roll totalled $1,025. His landlady saw
him counting the immense bulk of
bills yesterday afternoon, in his home.
He claims he was supposed to pay
off some men who are. also working
for the Russian government and that
part of the , money represented his
own salary.
Two obliging youths told Skirmint
of the pleasures of the American pas
time of joy-riding. He consented to
take a trip with them and they call
ed for him late -yesterday afternoon,
after he had finished counting his
money. His landlady warned him
not to go but Skirmint' was deaf to
her advice. .
They rode around the outskirts of
the city for several hours according
to Skirmint, when the car started for
the heart of the city. Two ihen sat
with, him in the back of the ma
chine and a third operated the auto.
They reached Stata and Broad streets,
about 8 o'clock. The machine slow
ed down, and things began to hap
pen. , "
One of Skirrnint's companions bang
ed him in the nose. The other loos
ened a few of his teeth with a well
directed swing." Skirmint yelled'and
pedestrians and residents in " the vi
cinity stopped to witness the affair. A
whack in the side of the head dazed
the young Russian and one of the
men extracted his roll as the car near
ly came to a stop.
The two men picked up the wob
bling Russian. One seized his feet
the other his head and after swinging
him a few times to give impetus to
their movements they threw hin clear
of the car into the street and drove
away with his $1..025.
He rushed jabbering, i Moody and
hatless into police headquarters. De
tectives took him into the emergency
hospital. Telephone calls corrobor
ated the assault i,n the auto and the
police are looking for his assailants.

QUARTET OF $50
CHECKS EXHIBITS
IN FAIR HEARING
Name of Fair's Wife Was
Signed to Tnem State
Claims She Was Dead.
Four checks for $50 each were Im
portant exhibits put in by State's At
torney Cutnmings when the trial-of
William F, Fair and Jack Deveraux
charged with manslaughter, was re
sumed before -Judge Burpee and a jury
in the criminal superior Court ' this
morning. Jan C. Zwart, a grocer: ot
Glenbrook (near the Fair honnaf . In
Darien, identified the checks. They
were signed by Olive Whirlow of Ok
lahoma, sister of Mrs. Fair 'and were
made payable to the dead woman.who
was then known as Grace Clifton.
Zwart remembered that he cashed the
checks in June, 191 4; two months be
fore the body was found in Darien. '
Two other checks were also intro
duced by the state. Both were signed
by Harry Simmons of Albany, N. Y.
One dated December 9, 1914, was for
$28.80 and the other dated January
15, 1915, ailed for $90. They were
sent in payment for an electric piano
purchased from Mrs. Fair. The checks
were made payable to G. ClTfton.
The state claims that at this time
Mrs. Fair or Grace Clifton was al
ready dead. But it was, found that
the checks had been cashed. xThey
were endorsed "G. Clifton." A letter,
said to have been writtten by William
F. Fair to Mrs. Ida McMahon,' was in
troduced and it is claimed that the
word "Clifton"' as he wrote it in the
letter, is identical with the endorse
ment on the check. - The letter was
written after Mrs.. Fair had disappear
ed. Her husband asks Mrs. McMahon
if she has seen Grace. He declared
she had ' disappeared.. .
The most picturesque witness of the
morning was Miss Lottie Stanton of
Sayre, Pa. She said she first met Mrs.
Fair 14 or 15 years ago and saw her
frequently after that. At various times
Mrs. Fair, had been known as Pauline
Fair, Pauline Foster and Grace Clif
ton. The witness admitted she had con
ducted houses in New York and other
cities.' After the .Rosenthal murder
in New York she had to close her
house and put the furniture in stor
age. Two letters written by Mrs.
Fair ,to the witness were read to the
Jury. .
Mrs. Fair wrote that she was liv
ing on her chicken farm near Darien.
She was downcast because she had
been obliged to close her house in
Albany, N. Y. She had tried to open
a resort in several other cities but
could not get a piace. Mrs. , air i
wrote of her visit to Baltimore and
said, "Just think of -having to go to
the police station and asking if you
could open a house.". These letters
were received in June, 1914, the wit
ness said.
On cross-examination Miss Stanton
caused considerable amusement when
she told of her literary aspirations.
She said at one time she moved to
Washington. D. C, and opend a la
dies' boarding house. She went-there
to write a book. She said the vol
ume wasn't completed yet. Before
she could give any further informa
tion Judge Burpee stopped questions
along that line.
John M. Savage, who worked about
the Fair chicken'' farm, said he had
often seen Mrs. Fair there. After she
disappeared in 1914 he said Fair told
him Mrs. Fair had gone to New York.

Lloyd George's Program for
Prosecuting War Holds
Attention.
J London, Dec. 21, The suggestion of
the United States for an exchange of
views among the belligerents has been
received at the foreign office and is
now under consideration, pending
which no statement will be made.
While the morning papers give
much prominence to American and
other foreign comment on Premier
Lloyd Georgvj's speech, the question
of peace was secondary today to the
discussion of the projected national
service. The comment everywhere
indicated the readiness of the nation
to mobilize. The description of Row
land E. Prothero, president of the
board of . agriculture of Great Brit
ain, as a beleaguered city and his de
claration, "the war may be won or
lost on our ' cornfields and potato
lands," are featured as furnishing
the keynote to a situation which calls
for the utmost national effort, , . y
4 The parliamentary correspondents
of the newspapers contribute reports
from the lobbies on the broad lines
of the government .scheme which
some .'ay embraces all males of 16, to
60 and others. 17 to 50 years.
Filling vacancies in the war indus
triessu ch as mining, shipbuilding,
etc., will be one of the first s,tep.
The Daily Mail which Is close to
Premier Lloyd George, this morning
'gave prominence to the following: ,
. "The Germanic and neutral press
views on Mr. Lloyd George's refusal
of the German peace offer largely
take the standpoint that he did, not
close the door to peace. The actual
fact, however, is that he entirely de
clined peace on anything except the
allies' terms and the door obviously
remains open only if Germany is will
ing to accept those terms, which are
complete restitution, full reparation
and effectual guarantees."
Expect Dr. Day to .

It is expected that the United Con

by any Congregational church in the
state. He will receive $6,000 a year,
with an allowance of $1,000 annually in

every year.

"We Are Drawing Near the Verge of War Our
selves," Says State Department Head, "And
We Are Entitled to Know What Each Belliger
ent Seeks in Order That We May Regulate
Our Conduct in the Future" Position of Unit
ed States Continues to Grow "Increasingly
Critical," He Says President Wilson Main
tains Silence.
President Summons Secy. Lansing.
Washington, Dec. 21 Shortly after 2 o'clock this
afternoon President Wilson sent for Secretary Lansing
and the executives of the state department went to the
White House for a conference. Count Vpn Bernstorff,
the Geirnai:aisador, conferred with Secretary
Lansing earlier in the day and it was understood the
secretary explained President Wilson's action in ad
dressing the belligerents.
Washington, Dec. 21 The danger of the United States iU
self of being drawn into the war by reason of its increasing!
critical position as a neutral, was one of the moving considera
tions in President Wilson's dispatch of notes to all belligerents
urging them to discuss terms of peace. , . '
Secretary .Lansing today authorized the statement that the.
material rights of the United States had not been the' paramount'
consideration. America's rights, he said, were, being more-arid
more involved by the belligerents and as the United States was
"drawing nearer the verge of war" it was entitled to know ex-
.Actly what each belligerent seeks "in order that we mayreg- -ulate
our conduct in4he future." A . -
0CWC1017 xjcuisiiig a ouitcuiei.il., ujjuu wiuuii 111c vrmnj xiuusu
refused to comment was as follows : '
- "The reasons for the sending of the notes were as follows:
"It' is riot our material interest .we had in mind when the
note was sent but more and mofe our own rights, are becoming
involved by the, belligerents on both sides so that the situation
is becoming increasingly critical. ,
"I mean by that that we are drawing nearer the verge of
w&r ourselves and. therefore we are entitled to know exactly
what each belligerent seeks in order that we may regulate our
conduct in the future. ' . v ;
... "No nation has been sounded. No consideration of .the Ger
man overtures or of the speech of Lloyd George vas taken into
account in the formulation of the document. The only thing the
overtures did was to delay it a' few days. It was not decided to
send it until Monday. Of course, the difficulties that face the
President were that it might be construed as a movement for
peace and in aid of the Germaa overtures. :He specifically ;
denies that that was the fact in the document itself."
Secretary Lansing said further: ) . : .
"The seffding of this note will indicate the possibility of
our being forced into the war. That possibility, ought to serve
as a restraining and sobering force safeguarding American
rights. It may also serve to force an earlier conclusion of thp
war. Neither the President nor myself regard this note as a
peace note ; it is merely an effort to get the belligerents to;define
the end for which they are fighting." . . -
At the White House no effort was made to -lessen the im
portance of "Secretary Lansing's statement. : President Wilson
would make no comment.
Pr-ocidATit Wilson himself on several
occasions has pointed out. the danger
of the United States becoming in
volved in the war. Because af viola
tions of American, rights, he has felt
that the United States had a. very dif
ficult role to fill. . .
Tst -February, vrhile touring the
middle west in favor of preparedness
and again during the last campaign,
th -President touched on that-feature, i
In a speech at Pittsburgn last Jan- j
uary he said:
"WftiPTi vou know that there are
mmstihle materials in the life of
the world and' in your own national
life, and that thesky is full of float
ing sparks from a great conflagration,
are you going to sit. aown anu &a.y n.
will be time when the fire begins to do
something about it? I do not. believe
that the fire is going to begin but I
would be sure of it if ,we were ready
for the fire.
"I want to come as your responsible
servant and tel you this, that we do
not control the fire. We are under
the influence of it but we are not at
the source of it. .We are where it at
any time may affect us and yet we
cannot govern its spread and prog
ress." - ' '
The dispatch of the notes brought
the greatest array 'of diplomats to the
state department seen there ; in
months. The German, British, Japan
ese, Italian and Brazilian ambassa
dors were visitors. The Bulgarian and
Persian ministers also called as did
Charges from other legations.
Although all official Washington is
listening with tle keenest expecta
tions to "any indications of how the
notes will be received, diplomatists
think it is incredible that President
Wilson should have taken his action
without some belief that It ought not
to flatly rejected without considera
tion by the entente allies. The wish
and hope of the German allies that
he take some such step had long been
well known and there is no doubt of
the manner of its reception among
them.
Officials and diplomatists here.
ASSEKIS
analyzing the President's note, find
something deeper than an -appeal for
consideration of peace terms. They
see that the President, in acting was
also considering what would 'have to
be the course . of the United States to
conserve its interests as a .neutral if
the war is to continue. , '
Coupled with the President's re
cent declaration that the position of
neutrals was becoming Intolerable,
they attach much significance to ; hi
statement in . the note that his sugf-
gestion comes from a neutral -whose
interests have been most" seriously,
affected by the war "arid whose con
cern for its early conclusion arises
out of a manifest necessity to deter-
mine how best to' safeguard those
interests if the war is to continue."
In German quarters the conviction
that the notes would lead to some sort
of consideration of peace terms was
expressed in the. following, authorized
statement by Coun Von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador: n
"Now I ani perfectly convinced that
there will be a conference."
Despite the fact that President Wil
son's notes state specifically and un
reservedly that he "is not proposing
peace, he is not even offering media
tion," they are regarded here as o.f
such a nature as will compel all bel
ligerents to make more, of . a reply
than a mere acknowledgment of re
ceipt. '"'.
British embassy officials made no
attempt to conceal their surprise at
the President's action? They were
not alone, however, for all official
Washington had been led . to. believe
that the President; in transmitting the
German peace proposals, without com
ment had taken all the action that
was to be expected .from" the United
States for some, time to come unless
there was some unforeseen develop
ment in world affairs. , . - "
The secrecy with which 'the pre
paration of the notes and their dis
patch were surrounded, was complete
