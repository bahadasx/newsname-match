and now it is so short, just look how
it is writing, and the writer has been
cooped in by the fire during the cold
weather and has not been out to find
out much news. To describe the
scenery around the fireside with the
"old woman" wrapped in her shawl
and the bandanna around her head
might lead to an unpleasant Christmas
for my *Santa Claus, so I will
favor the linotype operator this time
and not send in much to worry his
patience.
The best news we have heard is
that concerning the sick folks. Dr.
Roberts brought his little son Furman
home last week from the Baker
sanitarium, Charleston,- where he had
been for several weeks and had been
operated on for appendicitis. He is
now O. K., and will soon be well
^ again.
^ Mr. and Mrs. J. M. Kirkland's little
ft daughter had a minor operation of
the throat at Charleston last week
and is at home again.
Mr. O. E. -Kearse, who has been
Hft confined to his room for the past few
months, is getting on very well.
The many friends of Conductor J.
Smith, of Bamberg, are glad to
- - 4earn that he is doing well and sin y
eerely hope-that he will be able to be
./ out again soon.
Christmas is upon us again and
Santa is rich this year, and he needs
to be, for his presents are very high.
Only a few more nights now before
he will hitch up his team of reindeer
and over the world! Oh! such a journe^,
to make the little folks happy.
It is a mystery how that old fellow
can come down a chimney with presents
and not get sooty, and I get so
sooty just in building a fire in the
mornings. He is a wise old man.
Mr. J. G. Black, of the Thielen
theatre, Bamberg, was in town last
week on business.'
We will have dark nights this
Christmas, which will be fine for fire- j
works. Especially is this true in the
larger cities.
The Ehrhardt high school basket
/ball team played the Olar team on the
latter's court last Friday, one week
ago and got-a good flouncing.
Electric signs have commenced to;
arrive in town. The Farmers & Mer-1
chants bank has one winking and
blinking and telling you what to do
with your money, if you have any.
Mrs. R. O. Rice, of Holly Hill, arrived
in town last Saturday on her
annual Christmas visit among her old
home folks.
Mr. P. M. Kinard and Miss Ella
Hiers made their solemn 'pledge at
the Baptist parsonage before their;
pastor, Rev. J. R. Smith, last Thurs-'
day afternoon to live together and
share each other's troubles and pleas
ures as long as they both shall live.
The lumbermen who ship their
lumber from this station have about
gotten the whole side track from the
depot down as far as they can go!
completely blocked. There is lot of |
traveling with buggies, wagons and j
autos over this street and owing to
the blocking they are forced to drive i
across the side walk and are running J
into some fencing and telephone j
poles, damaging both. We foot pas-:
sengers that live on the other side of :
the railroad only have a small path
to get to and from our work and now
it is filled with lumber so that we
have to go around or scratch under,
i
as over would be dangerous. We|
think that if the town officials were i
to perambulate it would be our perdition.
Ehrhardt high school will have the
usual respite for Christmas, about
two weeks. JEF.
Occasional Writes.
Kearse, Dec. 1 8.?When Roosevelt
dropped the Progressive party, the
people of Kearse and Ehrhardt, who
know a good thing when they see it,
picked it up. So a few days ago a
few of our citizens met, and agreed to j
build a telephone line from Ehrhardt j
with a Y on the route and have one
terminal ending at B. V. Kearse's and
the other ending at H. A. Kearse's.
We know that very soon this will be
an accomplished fact. They employ*
ed a man to measure the miles with
9
his automobile, and lie took Henry
Chitty and Harry Kearse along with
him. but soon the auto refused to go,
and Henry got out and walked home.
The chauffeur then got along very
well for a while, but did stall once or
twice, and then Harry got out, and
after this it worked very smoothly.
The supposition is that two red head
lights, in the day time was a little
too much for the automobile.
But every party will have its factions,
and Willie Best doesn't like it
because they do not propose to carry
it all the way to Bamberg and put a
phone in every man's house along the
route, let him be a pretty man, or
an ugly man. And Eldon Kirkland
doesn't like it because he wants it to
go to Ulmer and stop right there;
and as for Arthur Brabham, who
never stoops to little things, he wants
it to extend all the way to Atlanta,
Ga. The line, as it is proposed now,
extends through a well timbered
country, (well timbered with lads and
lasses) and we predict for it a success.
Lewis Ritter, Henry Chitty, and
Scott Breland all seem to be interested
in this telephone route.. A gentleman
questioned them, and they all
gave about the same answer, which
was about this way: "I am growing
old and I want to talk to my friends
along the route, and leave something
behind me for the benefit of our posterity."
Christmas is. coming, and "Coming
events cast a shadow." I notice in
the express office several packages
marked "4 qts." I also notice one
package marked "2 qts." Now, the
law allowed the man who ordered two
quarts to get four, if he wanted to.
This makes me have an optimistic
view of the situation, still.
"Men whiskey drink, and do not
think
That we poor gals can tell it;
They don't suppose, a woman's nose
Was ever made?to find it out."

A PKKXCH ANTHOLOGY.
H<?\v One Soldier Relieves His Mental
Strain.
"To relieve the mental strain of
trench warfare, some men turn to
poetry," says a writer in the New
Republic; and he quotes the case of
a soldier who had made a collection
of his favorite poems:
"It a small booklet in soiled
paper covers. Loose leaves from
books of various sizes had been
sewn together in a compact little
volume which fitted nicely into the
pocket of his tunic. Among others
he had 'Kubla Khan,' 'Comus,' 'The
Ode on the Intimations of Immorality,'
all of Keats' odes and 'The Eve
of St. Anges,' Shelley's 'Alastor,'
Henley's 'London Voluntaries,' some
nineteenth-century sonnets out of an
edition edited by William Sharp, and
several poems by Francis Thompson."
The Cowboy's Prodigal.
A Texas preacher talked to a cowboy
audience about the prodigal son.
He described in detail the foolish
boy's extravagance and dissipation;
his penury and his husk-eating with
the swine; he told of his return, his
father's loving welcome, and the
preparation of the fatted calf.
The preacher in his discourse noticed
a cowboy staring at him very
hard. He thought he had made a
convert, and addressing the cowboy
personally he said from the pulpit:
4
"My dear friend, what would you
have done if you had had a son returning
home like that?"
"Me?" said the cowboy promptly
,tand fiercely. "I'd have shot the boy
and raised the calf."?St. Louis

FACES $1,000,000 DEFICIT
STATU INSTITUTIONS UXAI5LK TO
/ (?KT MONKV.
Tax Levy Insufficient.?Matter of Financing
Will He Anions liig Questions
in Legislature.
Columbia. Dec. 13.?The State of
South Carolina is facing a deficit of
over $1,000,000, and for the first
time probably in its history, has no
money on hand to meet current needs.
Of the $1,000,000 deficit the State
has already borrowed $700,000 for
expenses, the total amount authorized
by the legislature, and tonight the
State is short $340,000 of its actual
needs and cannot borrow any more
money.
The State institutions are unable
to get the money which has already
been appropriated for them by the
last legislature. The State Hospital
for the Insane has been without funds
for three months and the Citadel,
Winthrop college, the University of
South Carolina and other institutions
are going through the same experience.
The trustees of the University
have made arrangements for borrowing
money to run the institution and
it is understood that the regents of
the Asylum recently borrowed $100,000
to carry on the current needs of
that institution until taxes are available.
Small Sum Collected.
Only about $100,000 in taxes due
since October have been collected by
the State. The warrants for the high
schools which have been delayed on
account of the depleted condition of j
the treasury will be paid now as
vouchers for those in the hands of
the county treasurer were mailed out
by the comptroller general, Carlton
W. Sawyer, tonight.
The whole trouble appears to be
iK A i 4 Vt /s 1 A 4 ?tA A 4 *4 A 1 A A4 AAAftl
Liiai Liit; icgisiaiuic at its tasi scosiv/11
failed to make a tax levy sufficient to
meet the appropriations. In spite of
the fact that the appropriations last
year were as large, if not larger, than
the preceding year, the levy was only
six and one-half mills as against
seven mills the preceding year.
Should Have Been More.
One high State official estimated
that the levy should have been one
mill more than it was and he believes
this would have prevented the present
deficit and the embarrassment to
the State together with the prompt
payment and forwarding of taxes.
The matter of financing the State
will be one of the important questions
to be solved by the approaching
session of the legislature. They
will not only have to levy a tax to
take care of the deficit which will be
carried over, but unless they hold
down the demands the appropriations
will out run even those of the last
two sessions. The appropriation bill
last session carried about $2,500,000
and if one-half the demands for increases
is allowed it will reach the
$3,000,000 mark next session. The
State has always had to borrow
money until taxes were collected. i

French General Shows Affection fori
Fliers About to IMe.
A little story about the chief of]
the French *army is typical of. the
whole of his relations with the armies
of the republic.
He had called for voluteers for a
special air service, which meant almost
certain death. The three men
selected from the crowd who came
forward saluted and were quietly
walking away when he stopped them
with a word. "Est-ce que les enfants
I
| vont a la mort sans embrasser leur
papa?" (Are the children going to
their death without kissing their papa?)
he asked, and kissed them each
in turn.
The depth of the brotherly and
fatherly relations existing in the
French army between officers and
men has always, throughout the war,
seemed to be one of the great secrets
of the strength of the allies.?London

Farm Machinery Progress.
Progress in agriculture owes much
to the machine methods of doing
hand labor. Back in primitive times,
the savage planted seeds by means of
a sharpened stick. This marks the
beginning of farm machinery. When
the savage learned that by destroying
the weeds that came up with his
crops his yields would become greater,
he ceased to be a savage. When
he learned to prepare a seed bed and
cultivate his crops, he became civilized.
An old adage says that "Civilization
begins and ends with the
plow."
Reaping was at one time performed
by hand. Jack-John invented
a reap hook which saved much time
and labor for these ancient farmers.
Later the cradle came into use.
Less than a century ago Mr. Mc*
Cormick invented the reaoin? ma
chine. About thirty years ago the
self binder was put into operation. )
The latest harvesting machine puts
the threshed grain into sacks in the
field. There is nothing to do except
to gather up the sacks of wheat after
harvesting, thereby saving the extra
expense required to have the
grain threshed. With this machine
nearly two hundred bushels can be
put into sacks in one day, which
would have required the ancient people
who gathered by hand more than
a thousand days to put in the same
condition. Thus by the use of the
i up-to-date machinery the saving in ~
time is all the way from half to a
thousand times. One day in this age
of the world means something. Hun
' dreds of acres of growing crops may
| be cultivated and harvested by one
I man. In ancient days one man did \
well to care for a small garden
spot. -* .
The influence of agricultural machinery
on quantity and quality of
farm productions has brought about
many changes. The year 1850 marks jtf
the transition from the use of im- /
plements for hand production to %
those for machine production. In
the time of Columella the Roman
farmer spent four and a half (lays
in the production of one bushel of
wheat. According to government reports,
in 1830 in the United States
the farmer spent three hours at a
cost of 17.7 cents in producing one
bushel of wheat. At the present
-u ^
time the same result is obtained in
nine minutes at a cost of three and
a half cents per bushel.
I have dealt only with machinery
i
for the wheat grower, but improvements
along other lines have been
equally great.
The secret of successful and profitable
farming at the present time is
the use of tractors. Of course some
of our lands are too steep for tractor
farming, in which case good machinery
drawn by horse power will
be the only solution for some time
yet. But I verily believe that the
time is near at hand when some of
our great agricultural inventors, will
! come to our rescue with some fcind
I of machinery that will put the hill
farmer on par with the farmer on
I the plains. Let us hope that that
, time is near at hand.?Home and

How the Christmas Tree Came to
Broadway.
According to a story in the December
issue of The American Boy,
a youth named Oliver Stedman was
the first Christmas tree merchant in
New York city. More than one hunt
dred years ago it was when Oliver
and his friend, Mark Carr, went out
into the woods up the Hudson river,
and cut a large wagon load of fir
trees and carried them down to the
corner of Broadway and Vesey
streets, where they made their stand.
Before that, if a New York resident
wanted a Christmas tree, he crossed
the river and cut a fir tree for himself
and carried it home.
Colds sometimes get well in spite
of the excessive use of alcoholic beverages.
