Meeting of Potato
Growers Set For 29th
The potato growers of the Willis
ton district have determined to or
ganize a potato growers' association.
A meeting of all those interested is
announced for January 29, at 2 p.
m. in the court house.
J. E. Eastgate, whose talks on a
variety of farm subjects, including
potato culture, were so thoroughly
enjoyed at the agricultural conven
tion of last week, will be present to
lend his assistance and give the bene
fit of his experience. It is believed
that through a potato growers 'asso
ciation a more helpful decree of co
operation can be realized in such
matters as the common growing of
marketable varieties and the main
taining of standards of quality.
Potatoes have proven an unusually
profitable crop the present season
and it is thought that good prices may
reasonably be expected next year.
Those interested in the movement for
a potato organization hope for a
large attendance at the meeting in
order that the more important sub
jects pertaining to potato growing,
such as a potato warehouse and mar
keting, may receive careful attention.
The following program has been ar- bring distinction to

a new departure in the death-deal
ing torpedo.
About five years ago a citizen of
Williston. while reading in a mag
azine jevoted to mechanics, of cer
tain improvements in torpedo devices,
conceived an idea to which he devoted
two years of thought and labor. At
the end of that time he went to Wash
ington and laid his idea and his plans
for carrying it out, which were still
in the rough, before certain officials
of the naval department. He
European Nations Interested
It is significant of the complete and
efficient system of espoinage employ
ed by certain foreign countries that
the morning after the Williston in-
ventor had his audience with the
American naval officials he was wait
ed upon at his hotel by representa
tive of a leading European power and
assured that if the invention proved
what was expected of it, it would be
worth a vast sum. The ambassador
was anxious to learn if the inventor
would enter into negotiations and
whether money was any object to him.
The Williston man assured him that
he was an American citizen and that
his plans were in the hands of the
American naval officials and that any
value the invention might prove to
possess would certainly be retained
for the benefit of the American gov
ernment. This was three years ago,
before the European war had begun.
Called to Washington
A few days ago, County Surveyor,
J. C. Field, who is the inventor re
ferred to, received word to come to
Washington to be present at practi
cal tests of his device. The letter
grave assurance that the details had
been carefully worked out and work
ing models suitable to be used in
tests had been completed. This is
Mr. Field's third trip to Washington
in connection with his invention. He
feels greatly encouraged by the care
ful attention that the naval depart
ment has devoted to his idea and be
lieves that, as the plan was worked
out and developed, it must have shown
evidence of proving a practical suc
cess.
The essential feature of the inven
tion is closely guarded but has to do
in general, it is believed, with a sys
tem of automatic guiding for tor
pedoes after they nave been fired
from their tube.
J. C. Field is one of the early pion
eers of this community. He has long
devoted a portion of his time to the
profession of civil engineering and

was
given a most courteous hearing -and London. Dec. 19.—Premier Lloyd
assured thathis plans would be work- Caorge said in the House of Common
ed out by the department a experts today that it was felt that they shouli
and that due time his invention
would be given a thorough test.
Much as the entente allies longed
for it, the premier added, the cen
tral powers' note and the speech pre
ceding it afforded small encourage
ment and hope for an honorable and
lasting peace.
Mr. Lloyd George said the allies
would insist that the only end of the
war must be a complete guarantee
against Prussian militarism disturb
ing the peace of Europe.
Allies United
"Our answer will be given in full
accord with- our allies. Each of the
allies separately and independently
arrived at the same conclusion. 1
am glad of the first answer given by
France and Russia."
The formal reply of the allies, the
premier announced, will be given in
the course of a few days.
The premier said:
"We will await until we know what
terms and guarantees there are surer
than those which Germany broke.
Meanwhile we put our trust in our
unbroken army."
After declaring that peace without
reparation was impossible the premier
asked whether "all the outrages on
land and sea," had been liquidated by
"a few pious phrases about human
ity."
Rumanian Blunder
Dealing with the war situation the
premier said he had to paint a stern
but not gloomy picture. The Ru
manian blunder was an unfortunate,
one. but at the worst, it only pro
ff
longed the war and could not affect
it. It might have a salutary effect,
he continued, in calling the attention
of the allies to obvious defects of or
ganization.
To prevent the Rumanian situation
from becoming worse they had taken
strong action. In Greece, they were
taking no risks. They have decided
to recognize the agents of former
Premier Venizelos.
Speaking of.the western front, Mr.
Lloyd George referred to the growth
of the British army there and con
tinued:
"I am convinced ultimate victory
is sure if the nation shows the same
spirit of endurance and readiness to
learn as the mud-stained army at the
front.''
The premier analyzed the German
chancellor's speech and, then, declar
ed emphatically:
"Without reparation, peace is im
possible. Moreover, what guarantee
is there that subterfuges will not be
used in the future to overthrow any
treaties of peace into which we might
now enter?
War of Defense
"We must keep a steadfast eye
on the purpose for which we en
tered the war. We entered it to de

WILLISTON, WILLIAMS COUNTY. NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1916.
A Merry Christmas for Everyone
should
know before entering on negotiations
that Germany was prepared to accede
to the only terms it was possible, for
peace to be obtained and maintained
in Europe.
The premier said that without
reparation peace would be impossible.
Mr. Lloyd George said there were
no proposals for peace. To enter into
proposals of wnich they had no
knowledge was to put their hears
into a noose with the rope end in the
hands of Germany.

—DUTIES SET FORTH
T*
jis possible that the position of
clerk of North Dakota's much dis
cussed supreme court will be filled by
a Williston man after January 1st.
J. 0. Seibert, elected for the third
time clerk of the district court for
Williams county, and prominent in
political and business circles, has
made application for the' office and
has received a reply that assures him
of careful consideration at the hands
of the members of the bench, espec
ially the three newly elected mem
bers, who are likely to have a decid
ing influence in the choice of court
officers.
Mr. Seibert, while nominally a re
publican, holds broad political views
and the heavy vote cast for him at
the November election indicates that
he stands well with the local members
of the Non-partisan league. His ap
pointment to the high office to which
he aspires would be no surprise but
in line with state political develop
ments, the trend of which is toward
the selection for positions of trust of
forwardlooking men of admittted
ability.
Letter From Justice-Elect
In reply to his application Mr.
Seibert received a letter from Jus
tice-Elect J. E. Robinson who takes
occasion to set forth his ideas of the
regulations that should govern the
work of courts and also the require
ments that a supreme court clerk
should meet. It is suggested that the
applicant describe more fully his
qualifications.
The justice-elect takes advanced
ground on some of the matters
touched u{on and his letter has al
ready received considerable attention
from the state dailies.
Mr. Seibert regarded the matter
as confidential and gave out nothing
to the press. The letter as published
below is clipped from the Grand
Forks Herald of Dec. 19. The source
of the Herald's information cannot be
surmised unless it was Mr. Robinson
himself.
The Letter
The letter head reads: "Motto—
Let justice prevail. Associate Jus
tice, James E. Robinson. Office for
six years commencing Dec. 4, 1916."
"Bismarck, Dec. IS, 1916.
"J. 0. Seibert, Esq., Williston, N. D.
"Dear sir: I have your application
for clerk of supreme court and refer
it to the other judges.
"We want a clerk who can walk
and not weary who can run and not
faint one who can go into training
to fit himself for the office of supreme
court justice in the course of a few
years, according to the rules of civil
service.
Half of Decisions by Clerk
"We want a clerk of quick and
clear perception and good judgment
who can virtually decide half the
cases correctly and present the other
half in such a way as to make it
easy to decide them.
"We are starting out with new
court rules. The clerk must be in
the office from 8 a. m. until 5 p. m.,
except an hour at noon. He must boss

the gratifying fact that North
Dakota leads all other states in
the union in the proportion of

NORTH DAKOTA GUARD ORDER
ED NORTH—WILL REACH
HOME IN JANUARY
North Dakpta's soldiers are coming
home from the border.
The news is the best Christmas
present the guards and their friends
have received. As soon as transpor
tation can be secured the North
Dakota regiment and several others
will be brought to Fort Snelling.
Minn., where they .will be mustered
out of the federal service. It is not
likely that they.will leave Mercedes
before the first week in January and
cannot be expected to -arrive at their
various homes before the last of
that month.
.Telegrams to local relatives from
members of Company E confirm the
welcome news.
Groups Planned
Fort Snelling, Minn., Dec. 19.—The
First infantry, North Dakota nation
al guard and the Second Minnesota
infantry will be mustered out of ser
vice here, according to assertions
made by officers at this post today.
Just what time the North Dakota and
Minnesota troops will return is not
known, but from information receiv
ed today, it is not expected that they
will reach here until the middle of
January.
Maj. Gen. Thos. Barry, stationed
at Chicago, today received mes
sage from General Frederick Funston,
which indicates that the middle west
ern guardsmen will be sent home in
three groups. The order of departure
from the border follows:
First group—Michigan. Indiana,
Nebraska and Missouri infantry Illi
nois signal corps, Iowa engineers.
Second Group—Missouri and Wis
consin infantry.
Third crroup—North Dakota. Min
nesota, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and
Kansas infantry and Wisconsin hos
pital corps.
Moved in Order
The groups will be moved in the
order mentioned, according to the
present plan. As soon as the rolling commotion
stock used in moving group is re
turned the next group will be start
ed homeward.
The 997 members of the Third in
fantry, Minnesota national guard,
which was mustered out of service
here today, taxed the accommoda
tions of the post. More than 2,000
men are expected here when the
North Dakota and Minnesota troops
arrive.
Stanton-Oveson
The fortunes of two of the city's
well known and highly esteemed
young people were joined when Miss
Helen Oveson and Arthur W. Stanton
were married at the home of the
bride's brother and mother at Chinook,
Mont., Wednesday afternoon, Dec. 20
at six o'clock. John Oveson, father of
the bride, who is employed in Willis
ton went to Chinook to attend the
marriage.
Rev. N. E. Elsworth rector of St.
Peters Episcopal church of this city, I
performed the ceremony. It was a'
simple wedding with only a few
friends and relatives present.
Mr. and Mrs. Stanton will make
their home in Williston and will set
up housekeeping in the Dr. Hagan
residence soon after the holidays.
Many friends extend congratulations
and best wishes.
HERE'S HOPING IT PASSES
A Washington press dispatch dated
Dec. 15 says:
"A bill prohibiting the transmis
sion of liquor advertisements by mail
to any one except licensed liquor
dealers or agents, was favorably re
ported today by the house postoffics
committee. It is aimed at the so
called mail order liquor business in
dry territory."
Bully for the house post office com
mittee. Here's hoping this measure
goes clear through the congressional
mill and receives the president's sig
nature. Only last week the Graphic
registered a kick against the booze
letters and advertisement sthat bur
den the mails and expressed the hope
that legislation would be enacted to
prohibit them.
