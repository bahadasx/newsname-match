LLOYD-GEORGE IS BITTER
Declares Allies Must Have
Reparation and Accept-
ance of Terms.
London, Dec. 20. The announce
ment in the house of commons today
by David Lloyd-George, the new
prime minister, that the first act of
his administration was the rejection
of the proposal of the central' powers
for a peace conference constituted one
of the most momentous scenes which
the oldest parliamentary veterans had
ever witnessed.
The new premier declared that be
fore the allies could give favorable
consideration to such an invitation
they must know that Germany was
prepared to accede to the allies' terms,
giving "complete restitution, full re
paration and effectual guarantees"
and "to enter a conference upon the
invitation of Germany, proclaiming
herself victorious, without any know!
edge of her proposals would be put
tincr our heads into a noose with the
end of the rope in Germany's hands.
DENOUNCES BELGIAN SLAVERY.
Mr. Lloyd' George asserted that at
the moment Germany was penning
the note, assuring her convictions as
to the rights of other, pations, she was
dragging Belgians Into slavccy. He
announced that the note presented
through Washington contained
proposals of terms, but was a para-
phase of Chancellor .von Bctbraann
Hollwes's speech and-that the allies
had separately concluded to reject it,
Lalthouerh thev had informally ex-
changed views, and would' within s
few days present a joint reply.
Mr. Asquith, the former premier,
seconded Mr. Lloyd-George'sdccision
with even. stronger words and almost
at the same moment Earl Curzon was
informing the lords that' they would
enter no conference that did not
guarantee for Europe the free and in
dependent existence of nations great
and small. The marquis of Crewe
afiirmed the approval of the members
of the late government
