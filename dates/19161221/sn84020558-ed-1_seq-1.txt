PRESIDENT SENDS NOTES TO
BELLIGERENTS ftND NEUTRALS ItUUJKUl-

(By Republican Associated
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20.
i. tiii i ii? a

Without actually proposing peace or oi't'cfin nicdia
lioii, the president has sent formal notes to the govern
ments of all the warring nations suggesting that "an early
occasion lie sought to call out from the nations now at war
such an avowal of their respective views as to the terms
upon which the war might he concluded and the arrange
ments which would he deemed satisfactory as a guaranty
against its renewal or the kindling of any similar conflict
in the future, as would make it possible frankly to compare
t lieni."
Wholly without notice and entirely contrary to what
administration officials have described as his course, the
president last night dispatched the notes to all the belliger
ents, and to all the neutrals for their information. Sum
marized in the president's own words as contained in the
notes, his attitude is as follows:
"The president is not proposing peace; lie is not even
offering mediation. He is merely proposing that sound
ings he taken in order that we may learn, the neutral na
tions with the belligerent, how near the haven of peace
may be for which all mankind longs with an intense and
increasing longing, lie believes that the spirit in which
he speaks and the objects which he seeks will be under
stood by all concerned, and he confidently hopes for a re
sponse which will bring a new light into the affairs of the
world."
This latest development in the rapidly moving world
events toward a discussion of peace was not permitted to
become known until tonight when the notes were well on
their way to the American embassadors in the belligerent
apitalsnnd probably already in the hands of some of them.
It was a most distinct surprise to all official Washing
ton, which had been led to believe that with the formal
transmittal of the proposals of the central powers the of
fices of the United States would await further moves be
tween the belligerents themselves and that certainly, in
view of the spee -h of Premier Lloyd (ieorge and the an
nouncements in Russia, France and Italy, further action
by neutrals would depend upon the next careful and deli
cate moves of the belligerents.

d States) should they finally he unable !
lo find a ground on which to approach)
ni:e another. I
At the While House no statement
whatever could be obtained as to
w hether any of the powers even had
intimated how they would receive the
note and there was every indication j
that the same careful Hecrecy. which i
prevented anything whatever becoming ,
known about the president's action un-
til it had been taken, would surround j
any of the moves.
Nowhere on the surface appears any
indication of tne history-making events
which diplomatists generally are con
vinced must have transpired since the
ercnan allies brought forth their pro
posals to dispel the generally prevalent
oelief that such an action on the part
of ('resident Wilson would be unac
ceptable to the entente powers.
Rrilish embassy officials declared
they were utterly taken by surprise,
were wholly unable to explain it, and
were emphatic in their statement that
no exchanges whatever had

States would be Considered almost the
next thing to unfriendly.
All that, however, was before the
German allies of their own accord
brought fotward their proposals for
discussion of peace. President Wilson
specifically says in the notes he la
somewhat embarrassed in making the
suggestion at this particular time "be-f-ause
it may now seem to have been
prompted by a desire to play a part in
connection witli the recent overtures of
the central powers." i
To the central powers
the president
nis ins action was in no way "sug

while to the entente allies he says his
jiote Is "in no way associated with

ing it until those overtures had been
antovcred but r.u (he fact thut it ni.,,
oucerns the uiieslion of peacu and may i
urns ue considered in connection with I
other proposals which have the same
end In view."
Diplomatists considered it incredit
ihle that the president would bring
forward such a proposal at such a time
unless he had reaso" to believe It would
receive respectful consideration at the
Lands (if all the belligerents and above

was expressed in this author
ized statement by Count Rernstorff. the
German ambassador:
"Now." said he. "I am perfectly con
vinced that there will be a conference."
The nearesi parallel in world in his
tory for 1 'resident Wilson's action was
President Roosevelt's move in 1S05 to
end the war between Russia and Japan.
Hut In that case the president had been
assured his proposal would not be dis
agreeable to either of the belligerents
and curiously enough it was through
Kmperor William of Germany that the
preliminary soundings crystalized into
tne stigestion that ('resident lioosevelt

; Before that time President Roosevelt
had conferred with fount Cassinl. the
i Russian ambassador here, and with Mr.
Takahira, the Japanese minister. In
the Russian capital the American am
1 bassador, (ieorge von L. Meyer, had
: conversations with fount Lamsdorff,
, the Russian minister for foreign af
fairs. In Tokio, American Minister
Criscom had conversations with fount

(preliminaries was that President
Roosevelt was assured that he would I
