gesting that The Message should in
crease the subscription price of the
paper to $1.50 or $8.00 per year. One
mighty good Mexico citizen, and who
is widely known oyer the county, this
week offered to increase his rate any
time we say. We are not reckoning
on increasing our subscription rate,
ibut we are going to have to insist
that all subscribers pay up promptly.
Pay up. friends, if you possibly can;
we want you to remain with us.

The Centralia Guard will Increase
Its subscription rate from $1.00 per
year to $1.50. The editor feels that
he must do so on account of the high
cost of paper. Paper has more than
doubled in price within the last It
months.
"Some folks could s.iva on the cost
of living if they would eat more raw
food, like that Kansas City man who
Is shipping his foods to all parts of
the world," said John Dishman the
other day. "Breakfast foods cost
too much money. Go to the mill and
get your wheat and run it thru the
coffee mill, that's a piece of advice
I've heard."
