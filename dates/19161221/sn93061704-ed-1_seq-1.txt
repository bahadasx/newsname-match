múúHmmm
M. H. Senter, manager of the Es
tancia Telephone Company, was in
liountainair Tuesday afternoon and
yesterday, installing new phones. He
has the wire on hand for running a line
from Mountainair to Eastview. Several
phones will be installed both t East
view and along this line. A line will be
built from Mountainair to Scholle, con
necting us with the mines at that place,
as soon as the work can be done.
Mr. Senter informs us that it is the
intention of the company to run a me
tallic circuit from Mountainair north
eastward, connecting with the metallic
line near Dr. Sorrels place, north of
Willard, giving Mountainair metallic
connection with Estancia and through
to Albuquerque. A switch-board and
operator will be added here. The lines
will be divided between this place and
Estancia, and those in this vicinity will
be switched from the Mountainair
board, with no toll fees.
It is also planned to run a line or
more if necessary south to the Mesa
and install phones in that vicinity,
probably carrying one line to Gran
Quivira. Those contemplating install
ing phones in the near future, Bhould
see Mr. Senter.
Thursday Afternoon Club
The Thursday afternoon Club met
with Mrs. Orme December 14th. Owing
to preparations for the coming Christ
mas festivities in various forms, there
were few members responded to roll
eall and Current Events, but later oth
ers came in, and a most delightful af
ternoon was spent with this popular
hostess.
An unusual amount of business so
occupied the nine that Mrs. Hanlon's
paper on "Out Foreign Posaessons"
was omitted to be given at some fu
ture date.
Mrs. Corbett's resignation us Presi
dent was sent in, owing to her tem
porary absence, and the vice president,
-Mrs. Fuller, was elected in her place.
A liberal collection was taken for
some charity work and after very boun
tiful refreshments were served by the
hoptess assisted by Miss Bernie, the
ladies left pronouncing the afternoon
well and happily spent.
Real Estate Transfers
The Abo Land Company is having a
forty acre addition to the townsite plat
ted, which will be on the market short

Sunday School Christmas Tree
The Sunday School decided last Sun
day to have its Christmas entertain
ment and tree at the Chapel on Mon
day night, December 25. A short pro
gram will be given, followed by Old
Santa with a treat for each one of the
children. All are cordially invited to
attend.
Christmas Tree
The schools of districts No. 35 and 15,
uiapman and Means, will have a
Christmas Tree and short program at
the Means schoolhouse, December 23d,
Saturday night. All are invited.
There will be Sunday School next
Sunday morning at the schoolhouse and
we hope to have a large attendance, aa
the house is now comfortable.
Our Pie Supper was a financial sue
cess, thanks to the good friends from
Mountainair, and the school's patrons
and friends.
J a. ueai is preparing to erect a
garage on his lots north of the poitof
fice The building will be 20x80 feet.
The Mountainair State Bank has pur
chased the lots on the corner east of
the Voss Building occupied by Dyer'a
Garage and will at once put up a tem
porary building for thtf use of the
bank. Fixtures and supplies have been
ordered, and the outlook is good that
the new concern will be ready for busi
ness in a comparatively short time.
The lack of any suitable place as
temporary headquarters in which to
open for business mak' s necessary the
erection of a building, i-ery building in
Mountainair being occupied, both busi
ness houses and residences. For the
present a frame structure about 24 by
40 feet will be made to suffice. The
vault will be so constructed thai it can
be used in the new building, which will
replace the temporary structure so that
there will be no waste in the matter of
conutvu'tifn.
Shipping More Beans
Two more cars of beam have been
shipped out this week, bringing the
total shipments so far this season to
eighty-two cars. The estimate of beans
being' held both by buyers and farmers
varies, but it probably will bring the
total shipments from Mountainair very
close to one hundred cars this season.
The Little Christmas Spy
Our Madge, is growing tall and wie,
Has reached that most befogged of
tracts,
The land of Half-Belief, that lies
Between the fairies and the facts.
Her little heart's a crowded nest
Of faiths and fancies, dear and shy;
The dearer, since she somehow guessed
They'd flutter from her by-and-by.
Her doubts are pains, yet pleasures, too.
With which her timid thoughts will
play;
How sad the chill, "It mayn't be true"
How sweet the thrill, "But then, it
may!"
On Christmas Eve she long had lain
With sleepless eyes, like owlets
bright;
She rose, and rubbed the frosted pane,
And stared into tho starry night.
She saw the moon laugh round and clear
From smoky wreaths of cloud, and
throw,
In shapes like branching horns of deer,
The sharp tree-shadows on the snow
Oh, would he come, the jolly Saint,
Whom everybody talked about?
"It may be so and yet, it mayn't;
If I should watch, I might find out!"
She turned; her pulses wildly beat;
She'd like to spy but should she dare?
Yes! Pat, pat, pat, with stealthy feet
She passed adown the winding stair.
The great hearth glowed; the grave old
cat,
With fixed, expanded, emerald eyes,
Erect, before the chimney sat;
He seemed to wear a waiting guise.
The andirons shone; the clock ticked on;
Each moment made her more afraid,
"Oh, if he comes, I'll wish I'd gone
But if I go, I'll wish I'd stayed!
"Perhaps he isn't real at ail
But if he is perhaps he'll mind!"
A sudden soot-flake chanced to fall
She fled, and never looked behind!
She throbbed with fright, she flushed
with shame,
Her pillowed head she closely hid;
She said: "I don't believe he came!"
She sighed: "Oh.dear suppose he
did!"
Helen Gray Cone, in St. Nicholas.
A Christmas Eve Thought
If Santa Claus should stumble
As he climbs the chimney tall
With all this ice upon it,
I'm 'fraid he'd get a fall
And smash himself to pieces
To say nothing of the toys!
Dear me, what sorrow that would bring
To all the girls and boys!
So I am going to write a note
And pin it to the gate
I'll write it large, so he can see,
No matter if it's late
And say, "Dear Santa Claus, don't try
To climb the roof to-night.
But walk right in, the door's unlocked,
The nursery's on the right!"
