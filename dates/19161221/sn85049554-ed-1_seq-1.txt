Secretary Lansing in a statement to-

:%as because the situation for neutrals
was Increasingly' critical and the Unit

Secrttanr Lansing further said:
'The sending of Ithe note will show

serve as a restraining and sobering
force safeguarding American rights. It

Deepest interest centered today in
the probable time and form of the
reply to the note.
Shortly after 2 o'clock this afternoon
President Wilson sent for Secretary
Lansing and the head of the state de
partment went to the White House for
a conference. When he left the White
House he said he might have a state
ment later In the day. Such a state
ment, it is believed, will explain and
amplify his' earlier statement and con
vey an official interpretation of his re
marks.
[The full text of the president's note
will be found orTpage 2.—Ed.]
President Hopeful of Outcome.
President Wilson is relying upon
public opinion in other neutral nations
to add force to. his efforts to clarify
the situation. While the American
government acts entirely on ita own
responsibility, he feels other nations
for. economic* reasons are vitally In
terested in the outcomfe.
It was said authoritatively today that
th*. president acted without assurances
that his move .would be favorably're
ceived by the entente allies. He took
the position, it is said however, that his
note calls for replies and that even of
unfavorable the responses would tend
ground.
There is every indication that Presi
dent -Wilson Is hopeful of the outlook
Ad he believes tbie way has been
opened
for*
negotiations. What steps
he takes in:'the future depend entirely
on the nature of the replies to the
notes.

The Neue Wiener Jdurnai, published in
Vienna, says:
The reply of the entente nations to
the peace proposals of the-.central pow
ers will certainly be as equivocal as
the speeches of Uoyd-George, Premier
Briand and the Italian foreign minister,
Baron Sonnino. Nevertheless, the idea
of peace has made a step forward/'
Other Vienna newspapers, comment
ing on the speech of the British prem
ier, express the opinion that the rejec
tion of the peace off#r of the Teutonic
allies by the entente allies Is virtually
certain. The Fremdenblatt says:

Repeated efforts to save Elton's life

since his arrest in August, charged
with conspiracy..' He was given a trial
and convicted of treasonable activity in
aiding rebels operating in that state,
and was condemned to death. On rep

government, a stay of execution was
granted, but reopening of the case en
abled Elton to produce no evidence
that altered the findings of the court.

.1RST CONSIDERATION
Statement by Seoretsry Lansing Msks«
Clear Position of President Wilson,
Whose'First Aim Is to Insure th«
Peace of United States—Rights Be«
coming involved by Belligerents oit
Both Sides in Great Struggle.
Washington, Dec. 21.—The danger ot
the United States Itself being drawn
into the war by reason of Its Increaa
ing critical position as a neutral was
«ne of the moving considerations in
President Wilson's dispatch of notes ta
ull the warring nations urging them ta
discuss peace terms.
Secretary Lansing today authorised
the statement that material rights ot
the United States had not been tho
paramount consideration. America's
rights, he said, were being more and
more involved by the belligerents and
as the United States was "drawing
nearer the verge of war" it was entitled
to know exactly what each belligerent
seeks "In order that we may regulate
our conduct In the future."
Secretary Lansing's words, upott
which the White House refused to
comment, follows:
"The reasons for the sending of th«
notes were as follows:
"It is not our material interest vt
have In mind, but more and more ovf
own- rights are becoming Involved by
the belligerents on both sides so that
the situation Is Increasingly critical.
"I mean by that that we are drawing
nearer the verge of war ouVselves anlf*
therefore we ought to know exactly
•what each belligerent seeks In order
that we may regulate our conduct la
the future. j.
No Other Nation Consulted.
"No nation has been Bounded. No
consideration of the German overtures
or of the speech of Lloyd-George was
taken Into account In the formulation
of the document The only thing tho
overtures did was to delay it a fewf
days. It was not decided to send, it
until Monday. Of course, the dlfflcul
ties that face the president were that it,
might lie construed as a movement
towards peace and In the aid of the
German overtures. He specifically
nles that that was the fact In th«
document Itself." -i
At tho White House no effort was
made to lessen the importance of the
secretary's statement.
-:il
f-m
President Wilson himself on several
occasions has pointed out the danger
of the United States becoming Involved
in the wur. Because of violations of
American rights he has felt that the
United States had a very difficult role
to llll. Last February, while tourlnir
thc middle west in favor of prepared
ness and again during the Inst cam-'
paign the president touched on that
feature.
United States Near Wsr.
At Pittsburgh last January he said:
"When you know that you are com-'
bustible material in the life of the
world, and In your own nntlnnal life
and that the sky Is full of floating
sparkH from a great conflagration, are.
you going to sit down and say It wlll£NV
be lime when the fire begins to do-'-1
something about it? I want to com*
as your responsible servant and
von this, that we do not control fire*
We are under the Influences oL it, bufv
we are not at the Hources of"t. W
arc where it at any time may alter'
us pnd yet we can not govern
spread and progress."
-iS
Again at Cleveland he said: "Two*
thirds of the world are at war. It 1*
not merely a Ruropean struggle. Na
tlona. In the Orient are Involved asi'.,^
well as those In the west and all over^i|
there seems to be creeping upon thejf™^
nations disengaged a spirit and thai
threat of war. All the world outsldei •$
of the United States Is on fire *"3
Wilson's Pledge to Nstion. 43
In a speech at Milwaukee, where tho
president promised to keep the coun
try out of war if possible, he further,:
said:
"So far 1 have done sb, and I pledgee
you my word that, God helping me, I
will if It Is possible." He added the
people had bidden him to see that
nothing stained the honor of the United
States. "Therefore, there may at any
moment come a time when I can not
preserve both the honor and peace of
the Unitod States," ho went on.
In one of his campnlgn speeches. tha!
president declared that the presnt was
the last great war in which the Unitod
Stales could remain neutral. Ho said
on that occasion that the interests ot
the world were other nations sp drawn
together that it was hard for any na
tion to rematn neutral when the other
nations were at war.
