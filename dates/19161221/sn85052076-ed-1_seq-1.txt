Merrx Christmas!
Christmas is a good time ! We have done our work,
gathered our crops, repaired the barn, got up the fire
wood, and all the children and kinfolks are coming home!
And the thought of God's love, shown in a way every
body can understand, hallows the time. Every baby is
a proof of God's tenderness, and every mother an exhibi
tion of His love. "Peace on Earth," the angels sang,
"and good will to men."

FAILS APPROVAL
Carranza Withholds Ratifica
tion of Protocol.
MAY NOT MEAN REJECTION
First Chief Objects to Proviso Pro
viding That the United States May
Sand Troops Over Line After Ban

Philadelphia, Pa., Dee. II. Repre
miUUtm of General Carraata on th
Mexican-American joint commission
hare made admission to the American
members that tb protocol signed
throe weeks ago at AtlaaUo City had
aot been ratified. They supplemented
that admission, however, with a de
elaraUon of the atUtude of the Car
rmnsa government and assured the
Americana that the delay la ratifica
tion did not signify the rejection of
the agreement which they had signed
after almost three months of consid
eration. When the commission had ad
journed after two sessions had been
held It was announced that another
meeting would be held. Unless a
break In the conferences, now unex
pected, occurred It was believed that
the sessions might be continued un
til near the end of the week, when an
adjournment would be taken until
after New Tear's day.
It was indicated that Carransa had
withheld ratification when the proto
col was submitted to him by Alberto
J. Past, the commissioner who carried
the document from Atlantic City to
Queretaro, not so much because he
found the terms ef the agreement Im
possible, as because he felt that 'the
declaration of the United States gov-
ernment's attitude made by Secre
tary of Interior Lane, as chairman ol
the commission, made It Inconsistent
for him to accept It without in turn
defining the position of his govern
meat Secretary Lane had placed be
fore the Mexican commissioners a
supplemental statement. In which hs
had clearlr Inlicated that if it be
came necessary American troops
would be sent across the harder in
pursuit ef- bandits and that no re
strictions as to how the pursuit would
be carried would be tolerated.
Although not Included In the pro
tocol Carransa Interpreted this state
ment as vitally connected with the
agreement and his protested against
the pursuance of such a policy by ths
United States. To the oondiuons

WORLD NEWS
The leading event of the week
was the peace proposal mado by
Germany to the allies. It asks for
the return of all colonial possessions
lost in the wnr by Germany, gives
1 up the part of France now occupied,
! restores Belgium to its independence
with some limitations favorable to
Germany and asks a controlling
band in the Balkan peninsula.
It is not likely that the peaco
proposal will be accepted but it has
been forwarded to the nations by
the United States without comment
and should receive serious atten
tion, by all the nations to whom it
is sent. Should it draw from the al
lied nations a statement of the con
ditions on which they will consider
peace it will be worth while.
The Cabinet of France has been
reconstructed in somewhat the same
manner as the English, centralizing
the power of defense in a council of
five, with the prime minister as
head. It is thought that the effect
of these changes in government are
responsible for the stronger action
of the allies in Greece which has re
sulted in their favor, during the
week.
The Rumanian army has practic
ally stopped its resistance and with
drawn under protection of the Rus
sians for reconstruction, prepara
tory to offensive measures at a later
time should opportunity arise. To
all appearances their campaign was
not well planned, though they de
serve credit for bravery in carrying
it out
The people of Denmark have voted
to sell their islands in the West
Indies to the United States for $25,
000.000 and it is expected that the
legislative body will endorse the
popular approval and thus will our
country come into possession of a
position which' is valuable to us on
on account of its relation to the en
trance to the Panama Canal. In
the vote in Denmark the women
were given a part for the first time
and manifested an interest in their
new powers.
The French have unexpectedly
renewed activity in the region about
Verdun and succeeded in driving
the Germans from important posi
tions with much logs of life and
over seven thousand prisoners.
A peculiar turn in the Mexican
situation is something that looks
like an effort on the part of Villa
to open friendly relations with the
United States. He allows it to be
understood that he is not a foe to
all Americans and says that "he and
General Scott" could soon settle all
difficulties that are troubling the
two countries. To secure his favor,
however, we must renounce our
recognition of Carranza and his fol
lowers. Behind the Cabinet changes in
F.hgland it is possible to see the in
fluence of Lord Northcliffe, the great
editor of the Times and the Daily
Mail, two of the most influential
newspapers in England. It is in
large measure this influence which
is giving to the change such a
strong support on the part of peo
ple. 60,000,000 BUSHELS OP GRAIN.

PREMIER GIVES
BRITISH POLICY
Lloyd-George Replies to Gar

ENVOY PAGE DELIVERS NOTE
American Ambassador Hands Docu
ment to the British Government
Without Comment Balfour, For
eign Secretary Take Vacation.
London, Dec. 19. Both press and
public have looked forward to the
speech of Premier Lloyd-Gaorge In
the house of commons today as the
most important utterance of the kind
since the memorable speeches In
which Viscount Orey discussed wheth
er Great Britain would come into the
war.
Lloyd-George has recovered from
his Indisposition, and has been at
work. He will rise to address the
commons late this afternoon and
probably will speak for an hour and
a half.
The speech of the prfme minister
will be not only a reply to the Ger
man peace note, but also will outline
the whole policy of the new national
government, the trend of which may.
be roughly anticipated from the fact
that the new ministry Is avowedly in
power for the definite object "of car
rying on the war with all the vigor
the nation can command' to a suc
cessful end."
! Newa from government circles In
cluded the announcement of the de
parture of Mr. BaJfour, the secretary
i for foreign affairs, for a three weeks
I vacation. Although his vacation
comes at an Important Juncture, the
organization of the foreign office per
mits affairs to proceed uninterrupted
ly under the direction of Lord Robert
Cecil and Baron Hardinge, the under
secretaries, while the larger questions
of general policy doubtless will re
ceive the attention of the war cabi
net, over which the prime minister
presides. Lord Curzon and Mllner
also being members with wide dip
lomatic experience.
I The peace note of the central pow
ers was handed to the British govern
ment by Walter H. Pare, the Amerl-
I can ambassador. Mr. Page called at
the foreign office early In the day.
In the absence of Mr. Balfour, he pre
sented the note to Lord Cecil.
The note was Inclosed In a large
white envelope. It was handed by
Ambassador Page to Lord Robert
without any comment, and the recipi
ent made no reference to the ques
tion of peace, elmply thanking Mr.
Page for the transmission of mes
sages from the central powers.
The next step after the meeting of
the cabinet will be to get Into com
munication with the allies of Great
Britain, so that Joint action may be
taken. This Is expected to teke at
least a weak.
I it has been ascertained that the
note contains no terms and the Im
pression prevails In official circles
that until these are disclosed a con
ference Is Impossible.
The presentation of the German
note to the entente has now been
practically accomplished.

Tokio, Dee. 19. The German peace
proposals probsbly will be delivered
to the Japanese government some
time today.
Commenting on the proposals, the
newspapers declare that Japaa will
never agree to surrender of Klao
Chow. la general, they express the
opinion that the peace project as It
has been reported In the new dis
patches Is a farclal procedure and
will be unacceptable to the entente
because It is tantamount to abandon
