MILITARY TRAINING BILL
Major General Scott, Chief of Staff of
Army and Major General Wood,
Commanding Eastern Department,
Both Favoring Universal Training.
Washington. -The mobilization of
the National Guard for border service
was described as a military failure,
emphasizing the urgent necessity of j
abandoning the volunteer system as
. , the nation's reliance for defense, in
statements by "Major General Scott,
chief of staff of the army, and Major
General Leonard Wood, commanding
hip r,aRiern aepnrtment. noforo the j
SenntP sub-commit ton considering the
Chamberlain universal military train- i
tng bill.
Roth of the generals advocated uril- j
versal training. General Wood declareil
that the country now was utterly
defenseless against a well organized ( ?
foe; that the mobilization was a tragedy.
that if the guardsmen had met
good troops they "would never have ?
"known what hit them." General Scott
^ told the committee that lessons drawn |
from the present war proved that in I
.V ease of war with a first-class power
the United States would need immediately
a trained force of 1.500.000 men.
with another 1,500.000 available within
90 days.
General Wood, from whose depart- I .
ment went 85.000 of the guardsmen
sent to the border, said of the men
enrolled when the call came, an aver- !
nut- in .iu per cem 01 eaon company
had to ho dropped for physical defects
and the organizations went to the bor- I
der filled up with preen men. j t
"It's been a tragedy." he said, "but ?
worth all it cost if we only profit by I 1
it. It was not the fault of the officers e
or men, but of a defective system, i t
tjf- if we had been compelled to meet r
good troops down there U would have a
.been a scene of carnage. The guards- t
men would never have known what e
hit them." *
"What should we do with the Na- ?
tlonal fSuard, general?" Senator Brady
asked. C
"It should be replaced as rapidly as t
possible with men trained under a t
universal service system.'" General M
Wood replied. "When the system has J
been well started, I would drop the j *
National Guard entirely from any 1 i
scheme of national defense, although | t
we want every officer and man of them f'
in the new plan. But it must be a f
straight-out Federal force." 1'

Washington.?The Federal Trade , n
Commission, in conference with com- j,
mlttees of newspaper publishers, pa- ! t

effort to work out a plan for relieving
the -^newsprint paper situation, ad- ! j,

concerned throughout the country to ^
ascertain if an actual newsprint short- ti
age exists.
Publishers of the larger papers were ),
asked if they will relinquish some j,
of the paper they have contracts for R
during 1917; small publishers were (j
asked the extent of their 1917 needs.
they will handle.
The conference discussed a plan s
i>iv|ivoiiu iij uiuiiiunt-iurers in wmcn jj
large publishers would give up five v
per cent of their 1917 contract sup- n
piles to fill the needs of small pub- .
Ushers, to which there is n growing (j
objection on the part of the large
publishers. Plans of the publishers ^
for financing paper mills to help take
care of newspaper needs, it was said,
are taking rapid shape. Some publishers
are of the opinion that the pubUshers
of the country must arrange 4('
to take care for their own needs or
go out of business. ^

to forbid t lie manufacture and /

ho United States. Even the most
mthuslastic champions of the amend- s

How far the resolution will prop-ess
is problematical, and Adminis- \

ession. Prohibition advocates are v
uhilant. however, and predict ulti- c
nate adoption of the resolution and d
ts reference to the legislatures of 1
he various states at a much earlier k
late than they heretofore had hoped b
or. A two-thirds majority in both b

NOUNCEMENT SUPPLANTED j
BY CALM En JUDGMENT.
French Premier Warns Nation to

Nations to Enforce Peace May Be
Suggested By President Wilson.
Information contained in newspaper
reports in London leads to the
belief that the political leaders of
Britain will give the peace proposal
from the Central Powers to the Entente
Allies sober consideration,
which might possibly lead to a further
note from Germany and her allies
setting forth definite terms upon
wliii h they would agree to end the
war.
Criticism heard on the streets of
London as the news of the peace
move became public, seems to huve
become leSs severe with a feeling
that some consideration should be
given the note when It arrives there.
Premier Lloyd-George and the members
of Cabinet are maintaining a
strict silence vntlil they have an op
portunity to study the text of the
note ,
An entirely different reception was
given the peace announcement in
Paris as Premier Braiiul in a speech i
to the Chamber of Deputies, which I
voted to sustain the activities of the i
new Cabinet, sounded a note of warn- I
ing against taking the German pro- i
posal for what it appeared to be on I
its face.
In a stirring address, he referred
to the conditions as they exist at
present. However, in his words there
seemed to he a sentiment \reflected
for consideration.

Announcement of the resignation of
the Austrian Government in a Reuter
dispatch from Amsterdam may be the
forerunner of internal political dissension
in Austria which would have
an important bearing on the progress
of a peace move.
Announcement comes from Washington
that the President is seriously
considering submission of a proposition
to organize a league of nations to
enforce peace in the event there is
discussion of peace terms by the
European Nation^ A waiting attitude
has been adopted by the Administration
until the note arrives and
the heads of the Entente Allies give
some expression of their attitude.

when a scheme of organization

which was prepared hy \V. W. .

was unanimously adopted.

It was very probably the most representative

Pest to Come Soon.
! i
A month ago there were thousands j
of furmers and business men who did i
not believe that the boll weevil would
invade this state. Not on man at the (
Fairfield conference did not believe
that the pest would arrive. As a mat- j (
ter of faet the weevil has been found |

;.. ni-.u 1 -
in an iiiuiiiiu cuuiuy, seven miles (
from Augusta. and the representatives I
from the border eountiea all realize
j 1
that he will cross the river early next ^
year.
The campaign of preparation must | ,
begin at once and every man at the j
conference left with the determine- <
lion to spread the news among his ' ]
neighbors. <
TH? plan of n^^nization as pro- 1
posed by Mr. I.n^Btnnd indorsed by i
the eonference cc^Kins the following 1
important points: <
Two farm demonstration agents will
be appointed for eaeh of the seven
border counties, one to be paid by the 1
government and the other by the
county. '
Seven of the most patriotic and
trustworthy citizens in each county '
win ne appointed to constitute the (
county boll weevil council.
<
The council will work in co-opera- ,
tlon with the government and Clem ,
son college agents. ,
Co-operative bool weevil clubs are i :
to bo organized in as many eommuni |
ties as possible in each county.
The members of the clubs will meet j <
every 60 days and submit written re- I
ports as to how they are preparing '
for the cotton pest. i '
These reports will show the pro- 1
gressivencss of the mouthers of the
various clubs. t
The farmers are urged to begin at , 1
