In regnrd to his testimony on
the Almert valuation of tho Potomao

brand new explanation of the mooted
Item of $22.612 altoted by Mr. Al

Mr. Young auggcated that a por

This question, relating In the pay
ment of H.33h,",; by the Potomac
Klcotrln Power Company for tho
properly at fourteenth and It street,
and the franchise of the United Hlates
Klectrlc Lighting Company, gave rise
to n series of questions about the
propriety of thin payment that lasted
an hour.
Asked fa Kaplsln Hum.
In subject matter the hearing to
day ranged from economic definition
of "value" nd "worth" to the lunch
eon hsblt.i of New York business
men, and the comparative salaries of
the Commissioners and other District
officials.
Mr. Hyine asked the witness to ex
plain what the s'.'u'.'.Oi: for legal or
ganisation and franchise represented.
Mr. Young replied that It went to the
organisation of a high-class legal
staff to perform the legal work of
procuring a franchise. .
"Iteiueinber now, In respect to re
production, we are starting this com
pany July 1. 1010. In the District of
Columbia." Mr. Hymc said, "and that
would mean tho granting of a charter
by Congress, or Incorporating a com

"A lawyer I not paid for his time,"
remarked Sir. Young.
"That Is the one statement you have

piled Mr. Symr, amid laughter.
"Thcro sits John Harbour getting a
hundred dollurs for every dollar I feV'
Mr. Hyine commented.
"And there sits the corporation
counsel, who get about n dollar and
half for each dollar we get," laugh
ed Commissioner Newman.
Mr. Young said that some pnitlon
of the money had to be spent to edu
cute thu public.
"That'll another brand new Idea,"
said Commissioner Newman, "that
lawyers aio paid to educate tho peo

Of llnlrrlnlnmeot I'linil.
Mr. Hymn asked Mr. Young's opinion
about Mr- Almeit'a statement that
money had to bo spent qn entertain
ing In order to get the right people
Interested In the fianchlse. Mr. Young
said he did not agiee with the view
that money had to be spent In that
fashion.
"Of couise some might be leglti
mutely expended that way," ho con
tinued. "More business In New York
Is done at luncheon than In offices, I
daicsay."
Mr. Young stated that a portion of
money might be spent In educutlng
tho public, to tho need of an electric
power company.
"Do you think It necessary to spend
any money In the District of Colum

Congress tliut electric light would be

Commissioner Nowmun.
Then Mr. Young suggested that
some of It might be used to demon

NOT DUE TO GERMAN PROPOSALS
American People Want to Know If Peace
,
Cannot Come, on What Side Their
Interests Would Lie.
Plainly hinting that there is danger of the United Statei
being drawn into the war, Secretary of State Lansing today
said this was the real reason behind President Wilson's mes
sage to the belligerents.
The situation of the United States, as a neutral, is rapidly
becoming intolerable, he said. Therefore, the President has do
manded a show-down.
In a statement dictated to the newspaper men, the Secre
tary, speaking slowly, but with a trace of nervousness, said:
"No nation whatever had been sounded by this Govern
ment before it was decided to transmit President Wilson's note
to the warring powers. No consideration was given to the mat
ter of Germany's peace overtures, nor to the speech of Lloyd
Gcorgc, in the formulation of this document.
WILSON DELAYED NOTE.
The only thing which the German;
overture did waa to delay the send
Ing of the President's note for a few
days, although It was not finally de
cided to send It until Monday.
"Of course the difficulty that faced
the President waa the fact tWl his
action might be construed as a move
toward peace, and In aid of the, Oer
man overtures, This he specifically
denies In the communication Itself.
"It Is not our material Interests
that were considered In the formula
tion of thla note, but thn fact that,
more and more our rlghs havo been
Invaded by the belligerents on both
sides, so tha the situation has b'conie
Increasingly critical.
Ilranlng fearer Ta War.
"We have been drawing nearer to
the verge of war ourselves. There
fore, the American public haa the
right to know exactly what each bel
llgerenl seeks. lit order that wn may
rrgulate our own conduct In the fu
ture '
Hernatarn Disturbed.
Herman Ambassador von nernstorff,
when told of Secretary Lansing's
statement on the President's note,
was obviously and plainly disturbed.
For the first time In months he would
not offer a comment either for pub
lication or privately on war develop
ment. He gave the strong Impression that
he attached considerable significance
to Ijinslng's remarks on the purpose
bark of the President' note, and did
not seem to relish the suggestion of
the possibility of the United States
becoming Involved In the war.
Lansing nisrussr situation.
Prior to Issuing his statement, Sec
retary tensing dlsriissrd generally the
various considerations which induced
the President to take the action he
did. When, for example, the Secre
tary was reminded of the fact that
the President's note could not of Itself
bring about a cessation of peace un
less both sides were willing, he con
veyed the Impression that the Admin
Irtratlon was of the opinion that the
entry of the United Statea Into the
conflict might vnry well turn tho
scale of the war and hasten Its con-
elusion.
Against this view, both military and
naval men of the Government pri
vately declared that It the President
actually haa any such course In view.
It was Incumbent for the Administra
tion and Congress to make far greater
preparations than It has thua far been
willing to undertake.
Warned of flpark.
It was recalled that on the occasion
of his preparedness speaking tour last
winter before he ovei threw former
Secretary of War Garrison's plan of
army reorganization, the Piesldetit
warned the country that thero were
"flying embers everywhere" in the
world, and that at any time the sparks
might spread the war conflagration
to the United States.
Coming on the heela of tho sensa
tional action of the President In sud
denly Injecting himself Into the ne
gotiations initiated by Germany, Sec
retary Lansing's statement today
created a profound stir throughout
the National Capital.
Primarily, the statement was Is.
sued to remove the distinctly unfavor
able Impression In entente diplomatic
circles that the President's note to
the powers was a dellberato effort to
further Germany's peaco proposal
and to hamstring the allies In their
future couise respecting that pro
posat.
Note a W priihia.
The Immediate effect of Mi. Lan
sing's words, however, was to show
that the President' note was as much
a warning to the world that the Unit-
ed Htates might at all) lime at Into
the war to safeguard Its rights as It
was a move for peace.
According to official of thr Slats
Department generally It may be In
ferred properly that the purpose of
the United States Is even more defi
nite than that.
To the extent that President Wil
son may obtain fiopi tho opposing
sides In ih war a statement of their
objects, he will have prepared tha
Amctlran people. In thn event that
the war Is prolonged, -to fndoue any
decision of thu Government to entsr
the wsr upon one side or the other.
IUt V. . Has Been Affeetrtf.
On thr one hand, it waa pointed
out, the German nation, through Ita
ruthlesa submarine policy, and by
rrsson of Its apparent disregard for
past pledges, continues to violate
American lives and to disregard tha
protection that neutral American cltl
senshlp should carry.
On thn other hand. It was pointed
out, Great Itrltaln'e strictures against
American commerce, while not neces
salrly disastrous to American trade,
hac grown Increasingly Irritating In
their total disregard of what tha
American Government conceives to bs
the rule of International wart
If, then. It wa stated by respon
sible offlrlsM of th department, no
peace Is to come at this time, and th
United Statea must sooner or later
face thn problem of taking up arms
In defense of these violated rights.
It will be for the American Oavarn
ment and thn American people,
through Congress, to decide whether
the nation shall go Into tha war on
the aide of the allies or on the slda
of the central powers.
Must Be n4 On, Grievances.
And this dec. Ion, It waa pointed
out, must bn based not alons on th
relative grievancea of thla country
against the two sides, but uporwhat
each side defines aa Ita objects In th
war.
In every effort to aplaln away th
Impression that President Wilson's
action was In any sense prompted by
the German overtures, this Is ths lm-
presslon which the Administration
sought without exception today to
convej j namely, that It was the In
terest of America which President
Wilson had primarily In mind.
It was relterrated repeatedly today
that the note which ho sent to the
belligerents he has had In mind send
ing for some time. Hut It also waa
arimiiinl definitely and flatly, that
the fear that the entente powers might
