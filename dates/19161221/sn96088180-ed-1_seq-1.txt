Secretary Lansiag Expbias Tkat tic United States Govern
ment Is Not Coos: derisg a Cbsge ia its Policy Toward
the Belligerents fa Make? a Klore fcr Negotiations
btesded to Bring Ecd to
Washington, Dec. II. Th United
States government Is "not considering
any change In It policy of neutral
ity," toward tha belligerent nations,
Secretary loosing declared this after
noon In a formal statement, which,
he explained, supplemented tha one
ha had made earlier today. This
second statement waa made, Lansing
aald, oecauee his first had been sub
jected to "various constructions tie
had not meant to convey.";
"How about th first statement Is
sued earlier today?" Lansing was
asked. "Doe that still aland?"
"Why. certainly." Unslng replied.
'The second would be unintelligible
without the first."
Washington, Dec. 31. In making
hia formal effort to get a statement
of peace term from th belligerent
power and to evolve from the Euro
pean war mean of preventing a aim
liar word tragedy. President Wilson
acted with knowledge that th other
world neutral would stand behind
him. It was stated today. t
- He ha th greatest confidence that
hia effort will succeed.
Official and diplomatic Washington
today scarcely recovered from th
startling development of his sending
a peace not to all countries, await
ing, with anxiety th first response
Ident's suggest Ion for peace, deflnl
Ident's sggestlon for peace defini
tions. Tha president' action cam out of
a dear sky. He expressed this coun
try's "Intimate Interest" in the war's
conclusion thus:
"Lest It should presently be too
1st to accomplish th greater things
which He beyond tta conclusion.
"Lest the situation or neutral na
tions, now exceedingly hard to en
dure, be rendered although rntoler
able, and
"Lest n Injury b don civilisa
tion Itself which can never be atoned
for or repaired."
The president has made It clear
many time that he would make no
such move unless he were assured of
tta definitely accomplishing Its pur
pose. Determination to launch his pro
nouncement waa reached suddenly,
although he had contemplated such
action for several weeks.

STOCK MARKET
New York, Dec. "2 1. The stock
market, which broke two to 13 points
during the first hour today, was
thrown Into wild excitement and un
certainty by the announcement olf
Secretary Unslng that President Wil
son sent his "peace message" to the
belligerents because this country's
poslton as a neutral is bocomlnlng in
tolerable. An opening hour, of vast stock
dumping proportions with the heav
iest trading since the day th Lust
tanla was sunk was followed by nar
row recoveries. This upward move
ment continued after Lansing's state
ment was carried Into the financial
district on news ticker but hesitated

highly nervous and uncertain shortly
after noon, ,
, Sales to noon were mor than
, 1,800,000 shares.
the Ecrcpeaa War
dent's move waa discussed today with
a mixed feeling. There was out
spoken optimism at tho German em
bassy. :
Comment was mad on th "studied
language" of th not and It waa
pointed out that th president' view
on future guarantees squared with
those of Lloyd-George.
Washington. Dec. II. Plainly
hinting that, there Is danger of th
I'nlted States being drawn Into the
war. Secretary or State Lansing to
day aald this was. the real reason be
hind President Wilson's message to
the belligerents. The situation or th
I'nlted States, as a neutral, Is rap
Idly becoming intolerable, he said.
Therefore, the president haa demand
ed a show-down. t
Lansing authorised th following
statement as being the real purpose
behind the Wilson message:
"Our rights have been Invaded and
the situation I becoming so Intoler
able that It cannot go on long. .
"More and mor our rights are In
vaded by tha belligerent on "both
aides, so that th situation 1 be
coming Increasingly critical. I mean
by that that we are drawing nearer
to th verge of war and therefor are
entitled to know what each belliger
ent aeeka In order that w can regu
late our .conduct In th future.
"It waa not our material Interest
that were concerned 'When we aald
the. situation might becpm Intoler
able. W have prospered by th war,
but our rights have been invaded."
Lansing emphasised positively that
th Oerman peace proposal and th
Lloyd-George speech had nothing to
do wltb tha dispatch of th Wilson
note, except possibly to delay sending
It.
On this point he athorlsed a quo
tation as follows:
"No nation has been sounded on
this matter and we did not know In
advance what Lloyd-Georg would
say. And there waa no consideration
of German overtures or th speech
or Llyod-George In connection with
the formation or this note,
"The only thing the Oerman over
tures dtd waa possibly to delay the

BRITISH WAR TONE
London, Dec. 21. Within 48
hours of Premier Lloyd-Uebrge's first
speech, England has been unprece
dently awakened to the actualities of
war. Revolutionary changes have
come In such rapid succession ttiat
the publlo would not be surprised at
any development. If national pro
hibition on liquor was announced this
afternoon, It probably would evoke
nothing more than a sephyr of hostil
ity. Actual prohibition may not be
no remote, either, esitectally sine It
Is reported that liquor will soon be
entirely banned In Scotland in order
to Increase the outfmt of shipping;
not only by permitting mor work
by shipbuilding laborers, but by de
creasing cargoes of liquor.
Th publlo argues that It such a
move would augument shipping it
would probably also Increase the out
put ot shells and foodstuffs In var
ious way ir applied rigorously to
th entire country,
FORD
A T PLANT
TO CLOSE DOWN
in ti
Detroit, Dec. II. A a means o'f
relieving the railroad congestion
now threatening all industries in De
troit, th Ford Motor company will
suspend operation completely to
morrow and remain closed until Jan
uary 1. Th announcement waa made
today by Frank L. Kllngensmith, gen
eral manager. '
Thirty tbousand employe probably
will be affected by the order. None
will receive pay during the period or
suspension. '.
The shutdown will mean a loss In
wages to the 41,000 employes af
fected of more than f 1,470,000.
At th same time tha plant will
sacrifice its profits on approximately
17,500 cars. The Ford plant Is now
turning out about 2,500- machine;
dally.
"We are doing this from a hu
mane standpoint," aald Klingenemlth,
"We bar lota or order and could
continue shipping our product, bnt
we believe the railroads should not
jbe congested with commodities that
are not necessities or lire.
"By closing onr plant we are doing
our share to assist the railroads in
relieving the congestion now con
fronting them. It will save fuel, lab
or and cars that might be used for
the transportation of freight that I
highly necessary to life. .
WORLD PEACE IS .
. HOPE OF NATION
Washington, Dec. 21. The most
Influential society this nation could
organls would be 2,000,000 to 3.
000,000 young men under universal
military service, Secretary George
Hewitt Myers or th Army League de
clared today.
"The strongest Influence for hon
orable peace." he continued, "would
be a system of universal military
service. Under our present volun
teer system, everybody outside th
regular army and th national guard
expects th other fellow to go when
ever there Is any danger ot this conn
try being plunged into war. '
"Th average man either says
openly or thinks that there will be
plenty 61 men or a venturesome spirit
to rill up an army. With this Idea
In mind. It has been frequently de
clared that we could raise a. million
men between sun-up and sun-down
ir the country was threatened. x
"But this doe not prevent men or
Jingo proclivities- from demanding
j that we rush Into war often without
i a. just cause."
Myers holds, In common with mili
tary men, that If this nation hopes
for a world guarantee or peace, it
must contribute a larger military
share to the guarantee than it can
now offer.
