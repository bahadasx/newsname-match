jMcuie yesterday morning broke the'
fnarket and floor records for the high
est average of any loose leaf ware
house in this Btate. and it was some
tobacco that helped lllllle Steele
broaden his sotIIp over the other fel
lows. There w,ere two crops, one from
this county anuVone from (lallln coun
ty, Ohio, that naarie things go up where
"they were pitted on sale. Both were
good ones, afl after the sales and the
figures till listen footed "l it was
found thejf jHrnt-ed $120.03, soniojhlng
out of the Alliiary, and who would
have ttioufth&en years ago that to
bacco would Wmc reached that figure?
These flgureArove that the Mayaville
market Is fa!r" ahead of aH others in
this state.
The gentler sex is noted for being
vain. But our experience proves that
a man or boy is just as proud of his
appearance So we have a 'suggestion
for (he ladies buy him something to
wear If you want to make him hap
py. Our stock of gifts for men and
boys Is varied, excellent and every
thing sensibly priced.

Xmas
for the
The big removal sale of McIIvaln.
Knox & Dlener, which opened on last
W .'ilnesday week, has drawn very
'large crowds to their store on Sutton
latraat on each day of the sale and the
jmany bargains which were to be found
on last week have been greatly re
dueeil in number. There are atlll a
number of excellent bargains in this
store however and all who are In a
quandary as to what to purchase for
Christmas presents for either friends
or members of the family should visit
this store, where they will be sure to
find something that will suit every
one. There will only be two more dnys of
the big sale and everyone that is con
templating visiting this store should
do so at once. The largest number of
bargains that have ever been placed
before the public of this city and coun
ty are offered In this sale and one
versed In the prices of furniture will
at once appreciate the great sacri
fice being made by this firm.
Throughout the entire sale the num
bers of persons that have visited the
store have spent several thousand dol
lars and all of them have left the es
tablishment well satisfied that they
were getting the best bargain that
could be found anywhere. The man
agers of the store know that satisfied
customers are the best assets to big
pales and therefore have taken great
pains to this end. -
The company will remove to their
new store on East Second street soon
after the first of the year and will
continue their extensive business of
selling furniture and conducting their
undertaking establishment from that
place.

Average of 917.46 Per
II u ml rwt.
f IIHISI MS KVmmiMtKNT
Salea Wednesday on the Mayivllle
tobacco breaks totaled 100,610 pounds
and averaged $17.46 per hundred
which breaks all records for this mar
ket, the highest price before but little
exceeding $17 per hundred. The prices
of the weed yesterday ranged from $8
to $35 per hundred.
The tobacco was sold rapidly on yes
terday and no rejections were reported
to this office. The farmers seemed to
be well pleased with the price the to
bacco is bringing, for never since the
Civil War have such prices been given
for tobacco in this state.
A large quantity of tobacco came in
all day yesterday and far Into the
night. The first sales of the morning
were held in the Growers house. The
weather conditions are most favorable
for curing the weed, although the rain
and bad condition of a great many of
the roads In the county is keeping a
large amount of tobacco hack from the
market.
The market will close today for the
Christmas holidays and a large num
ber of prominent warehousemen will
go to their homes In other states. The
market will reopen on Thursday, De
cember 28, just one week after the
close.

A meeting of the Hoard of lliroctors
of the Mayaville Chamber of Commerce
was held yesterday In the headquar
ters of that organization In the Flrst
Stiindard flank for the purpose of In
terviewing Mr. Ralph K. Thomas of
Portsmouth, Ohio, secretary of the
Hoard of Trade of that city. Mr. Thom
as had bean requested by the Hoard of
Directors to pay this city a visit and
have a talk with them. The Hoard Is
trying very hard to find a man to take
the place of Mr. Thomas P. Roone.
resigned secretary of the local Cham
ber of Commerce, and all of them
so tned very favorably Impressed with
Mr. Thomas.
Although the Portsmouth gentleman
did not state whether or not he would
OODalwSr I proposition from the local
organization or not, he seemed perfect
ly frank v It h the Hoard. Mr. Thomas
has been secretary of the Hoard of
Trade in Portsmouth fcr a number of
years and Is reported to be a live wire,
lie litis had much experience In con
duetlng the Portsmouth Korn Karnlval.
whleh is very similar to Ihe Tobacco
Fair and Corn Show held In Maysvllle
the latter part of November. He would
undoubtedly be a great asset to the
local organization and the Hoard of
Director! would make a wise choice
In choosing him.
However, the Hoard will look around
I iiit more befor making a final choice
In the matter. They will doubtless
n ako a choice by the middle of Jan
uary, about which time Mr. Roone will
leave for Henderson. It Is now thought
that an outside man will be chosen,
al'houeh at first It was reported that a
HajrarUhl man would be chosen for the
position.
