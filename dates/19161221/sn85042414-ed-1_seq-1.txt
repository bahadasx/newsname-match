London, Dec. 21—The Exchange
Telegraph company's Amsterdam cor
respondent quotes the following from
the Berlin Tagellsche Rundschau re
garding the referenpe made in the
House of Commons by Andrew Banar
Iaw, chancellor of the exchequer, to
the case of Captain Blalkie of the
British steamer Caledonia, taken pri
soner by the Germans:
"The German government now has
formally taken the position that Eng
land's armed commercial and passen
ger steamers are men of war, being
armed auxiliary cruisers. The prom
ise given to America—which has al
ways hindered our submarine war—
that these vessels before being tor
pedoed must be stopped and be ex
amined, falls to the ground. They
are warships and must be treated as
such, even when Americans are on
board.
"We now have facilities for extend
ing the undersea boat war, which all
sensible people have lonar recognized
as unavoidable and indispensable.
This is the best reply to Premier
Lloyd George's refusal of our peace
offer."
Mr. Bonar Law, In his statement in
the House of Commons on Tuesday,
said Germany had given assurance
that Captain Blalkie would not share
the fate of Captain Fryatt of the Brit-
fsh. steamer BtuMelfc. who wa'S exe^'
chai 'fiis vessel had attempted to ram
a German submarine. Germany, the
idfaftceltor staled, considered the:
Caledonia an armed cruiser and that
Captain Blalkie in attempting to ram
the undersea boat was merely per
forming his duty.

DAKOTA'S
UNITED STATES STEEL
SENT DOWN MANY POINTS
LOST IN OTHER STOCKS
Brokers Urge Customers to
do no Trading Till Con
ditions Settle.
New York, Dec. 21.—Extreme
weakness bordering upon demoraliza
tion marked the opening dealings on
the stock exchange today. The so
called war shares broke from two to
eleven points, these being extended in
the course of the flrst ten minutes.
The most sensational feature was
the offering of 50,000 shares of Uni
ted States steel at 104 1-2 to 105 1-2
against yesterday's closing price of
108. Never before in the history of
the exchange has a single block of
such volume been recorded.
Including the 50,000 share lot at
the opening, total sales in steel
amounted to 220,000 shares within
the first half hour, at between 104 1-2
and 106 1-2. The lots sold ranged
from 1,000 to 6,000 shares with one
lot of 15,000 shares.
The selling seemed to come from all
quarters and represented further un
loading of Impaired margins. A re
newal of liquidation was largely
ascribed to President Wilson's note to
the belligerent nations.
Recoveries proved of brief duration,
steel falling to 104 soon after 11
o'clock with similar recessions in
other industrials. Sales of the first
hour aggregated 150,000 shares.
There was finite an accumulation
of seasoned stocks, notably rails,
where the initial losses were soon
changed to gains. Brokers were re
ported as urging their customers to
refrain from further trading until
conditions became more settled. In
creased margin, as much as 50 per
cent, was demanded in. some in
stances.
The market continued to, break
during the noon hour, steel declining
to 102%,' with two to five points
losses in other stocks, which were ex
empt from the early onslaughter, in
cluding "some of the rails-
Another wave of selling swept the
market during the last hour, prices
tumbling to the lowest level of the
day. Active stocks sold 5, 10 and 15
points under yesterday's final quota
tions. Total transactions just before
the close were estimated at 2,700,000
shares, the largest with one or two
exceptions, in the history of the New
York Stock Exchange.

Auditing State Books have
Not Complied With Laws
Bismarck. N- 13.. Dec. 21.—Con

plied with the law requiring that they
be chartered in North Dakota,
Thomas Poole, a chartered.accountant

an order restraining State Auditor
Jorgenson from paying the auditors
any further salaries.
The legislature in 1915 provided
$15,000 tor this work. Half of the
amount, was used in 1915, and the
majority of the remainder has al
ready been paid out in salaries of
$15 dollars the day to half a dozen
Minneapolis accountants, who have
been at work.since early in October.
Poole claims any contract which
Governor Hanna may have made
with the accountants is illegal, and
cannot stand up.

Chicago, Dec. 21.—A maximum de
cline of seven cents was registered
in the wheat market on the opening
today because of President Wilson's
peace note.
There was a stormy time in the
wheat pit during the flrst 15 lu.autes.
The confusion was so great that
numerous instances were witnessed
where brokers plunged through the
crowd as if on the football field and
grabbed each other by the shoulders
to shout into each others faces.
An uprising assumed more and
more impetus when traders had gain
ed time to breathe freely and signs
were noticed that sortie at least of the
buying of future deliveries was on
European accounts and that exporters
were among the. active bidders for
cash wheat. At this stage the market
had climbed more than four cents
up from the bottom level, touched at
the outset.

Lansing Qualifies Statement
Given Out Early
Today.
Wrong Impression Created
in Some Quarters, He
Said.
Washington, Dee. 21.—Secretary
Lansing, after a conference with
the president this afternoon, is
sued a statement qualifying his
previous statement on the presi
dent's note to the belligerents, be
cause, lie said, ho feared some in
correct inferences were being
drawn from his flrst utterances.
His statement follows:
"I have learned from several
quarters Hint a wrong Impression
was made by the statement I made
this morning and I wish to correct
it.
"My intention was to suggest the
very direct and necessary Interest*
Which tills country, as one or the
neutral, nations, has In tho possible
terms which the' lielllgcrents may''
have In mind, and did not intend
to Intimate that the government
was considering any change in its
policy of neutrality, which It lias
consistently pursued in the face of
constantly Increasing difficulty.
"I regret that my words were
open to another construction as I
now realize tliey were. I think the
.whole tone and language of the
note to the belligerents show the
purpose without further comment
on iny part. It is needless to say
that I am unreservedly in support
of that purpose and hope to sec it
accepted."'
CENSOR IS ACTIVE.
London, Dec. 21.—No new devel
opments of importance were report
ed in the evening papers here today.
Even the last editions add nothing
to the peace discussions, particular
ly on the United States note.
Tlie above dispatch indicates that
the English censor is withholding
much information on President
Wilson's note.
WILSON'S NOTE
IN CAPITALS OF
flROPE TODAY
Does not Propose Peace or
Offer Mediation, But
Asks Conference.
Washington—In formal notes to all
the belligerents. President Wilson
without proposing peace or offering
mediation, has appealed to tlyem to
discuss terms which may end the war. I
The president's notes had been
practically 48 hours on their way
today and officials believed they 'have
reached all the foreign capitals. All
official Washington is listening with
the keenest expectation to any Indi
cations of how the notes will be re
ceived.
Dliplomatists think that it 'is in
credible that President Wilson should
take his action without some
that: it would not be flatly rejected
without consideration by the entente
allies. The wish and hope of the Ger
man allies that he take such step
long had been well known and there
la no doubt of the manner of Its re
ception among them.
Officials and diplomatists are an
alysing the president's note find
something deeper than an appeal for
consideration of peace terms. They
see that the president in acting was
also considering.what would have to
be the course of the United States
to conserve Its Interest as a neutral
if the war Is to continue.
Coupled with the president's recent
declaration that the position of neu
trals was becoming intolerable they
attach much significance to his state
ment in the note that hls suggestion
comes from a neutral whose Interests
have been most seriously affected ty
the war, and "whose concern for its
conclusion arises out of .a manifest
necessity to determine hqw best to
safeguard those Interests the war
Is to continue."

I). S. RIGHTS NOCONSIDERATION GIVEN ANY POWER
German Overtures and Speech of Lloyd George not Tak
en into Account, Lansing Says—President Does not
Regard Message as Peace Plea, but Simply as Request
For Definition of End to Which War is Waged.
Washington, Dec. 21.—The danger of the United
States itself being drawn into the war, by reason of its
increasingly critical position as a neutral, was one of
the moving considerations in President Wilson's dis
patch of notes to all the belligerents urging them to
discuss terms of peace.
Secretary Lansing said: "The sending of this
note will indicate the possibility ot our being forced
into the war. That possibility ought to serve as a
restraining and sobering force, safeguarding Ameri
can rights. It may also serve to force an earlier con
clusion of the war. Neither the president nor mvself
regard this note as a peace note it is merely an effort
to get the belligerents to define the end for which they
are fighting."
1r--
-4',VAi
Secretary Lansing today authorized the state
ment that the material rights of the United States had
not been the paramount consideration. America's
rights, he said, were being more and more involved by
the belligerents and*as the United States was "draw
ing nearer the verge of war," it was entitled to know
exactly what each belligerent seeks, "in order that we
may regulate our conduct in the future." Secretary
Lansing's statement was as follows:
"The reasons for the sending of the note were as
follows:
"It isn't our material interest we had in mind
.when the note,jyas..sent, but more,jmd more pur
rights arFbeeoming unsolved 'by'^ We'belligeretidr on V'*
both sides, so that the situation is becoming increas
ingly critical.
"I mean by that, that wc are drawing nearer the
verge of war ourselves and, therefore, we are entitled
to know exactly what each belligerent seeks in order
that we may regulate our conduct in the future.
"No nation has been sounded. No consideration
of the German overtures or of the speech of Lloyd
George was taken into account in the formulation of
the document. The only thing the overtures did was
to delay it a few days. It was not decided to send it
until Monday. Of course, the difficulties that faced
the president were that it might be construed as a
movement toward and in aid of the German over
tures. He specifically denies in the document itself
that that was the fact."
