Sail boats did not comprise any
considerable part of the flotilla on
the Maumee in the years from 1870
to 1880, for the reason that the
water in tho river was not of a
sufficient depth at all times to per
mit of the free use of a center
board. A little yachting experi
ence of others once provided the
writer the opportunity to do a lit
tle "high financeering" on a small
scalo.
There were several yachts of
fair size on the river in the seven
ties. One of the largest and finest
of these was owned in Maumee by
a young gentleman ' whoso name
has escaped my memory, but who
was connected in some way with
one of the drug stores in that vil
lage, lie was an enthusiastic
yachtsman all right, too, tor an
amateur, and while he was the
owner and sailing master of this
yacht he learned a thing or t o of
the fickleness and treachery of the
winds on the Maumee. One sultry
June afternoon while he and two
companions were out for a sail in
ono of those fitful breces for
which our river used to be noted,
and when about midstream oppo
site the old grist mill they were
caught in a squall which came
with such suddenness that almost I
before they knew what was upon
them their yacht was capsied and
all three were floundering in the
water. They caught hold of their
overturned craft, and were in no
danger of drowning. It so hap
pened that just at this time there
were several boys preparing to go
for a fishing trip at the old null after that date all payments will

ashore, hail her out, and deliver it
at the wharf m Maumee on the fol
lowing afternoon, to which the hoy
not only willingly but eagerly
agreed. That evening while our
crowd of hoys wero gathered at
the old mill dock for the usual
daily swimming fest, this boy who
had done the rescue act and who
considered himself quite a hero in
consequence thereof, told in a
boastful way of what he was going
to do with the five big dollar? he
was to get as soon as he delivered
the ship-wrecked yacht to its owner
on tho following day. And bear
in mind that fivo whole dollars Avas
an awful large amount of money
for a young boy to have at one
time in those days. But he made
one fatal mistake at our swimming
fest that evening he talked too
much. Well, while he was loudly
boasting of the five bucks, and
what he was going to do with them,
the thought occurred to mo that it
would not be a bad idea if I could
get some or all of that prize money
for myself. You see it was Hear
ing the glorious Fourth of July,
and I really did need the money
as badly as did the hero of the
rescue act.
After our swimming fest was
over one of my pals and myself de
cided that early on tho following
day we would return the yacht to
its owner in Maumee and get the
prize money or try to get it. So
at about 7 o'clock the next morn
ing we went at it. Our little friend
had bailed out the yacht, cleaned
her up, and put her in fine shape,
and had then secured, her to the
dock with a large chain and a
padlock about the sizo of a .small
ham. Well, it took us just about
seven seconds to smash that lock
and push tho yacht out into the
stream. Our plan was to "pole"
tho boat over to tho dock at Mau
mee, there not being enough breeze
that morning to sail her over and
no oars on the boat. But poling
tho boat that distance was some
job, too, especially to get her
through tho old channel that had
been dredged for some distance,
near Garden Island, with the
gravel thrown up to one side in a
sort of embankment. Thero was
quite a current through that chan
nel. After passing through this
channel tho water was more shal
low and in some places wo dropped

The great question now staring
every newspaper publisher in the
face is "shall he raise the price of

himself compelled to accept one of

tne actual cost ot naner alone.
Auuou to tins is Tiie general in
crease in cost of every ariele and
feature of the production.
Every article that enters into
the cost of living has doubled in
cost and the publisher, like all
other human being?, must live and
pay the necessary price.
For these reasons the publisher's
product, the same as .ill products
of the farm, the factory and shop
must sell for a rate that will give
a living margin of profit.
In order to exist we are com
pelled to announce that on and
after the loth of February, the
subscription price of the Journal
will be one dollar and. fifty cents
per year m advance,
"We will give our subscribers the
privilege of pacing as many years

present rate of one dollar per year.

before February 15, 1917. but

the past and earnestly hope for its
continuation in the future.
