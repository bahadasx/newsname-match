Sioux City Journal, 17: Develop
ments last night in the search for
Clyde D. Armour, of Sioux City,
who is believed to have been slain
by a companion in New Mexico
while making an overland trip in an
automobile, revealed but little in
formation which might shed light
on the whereabouts of the missing
man. It has been learned that Ar
mour disappeared between Santa
Fe and Valley Ranch, the latter
being tpenty-five miles north of San
ta Fe. A dozen business men of
Santa Fe, who saw a man 'supposed
to be Armour recently, when shown
photographs of the missing man
were convinced that the real Mr.
Armour was not in Santa Fe. Glen
Armour and Roy Armour, brothers
of the missing man, last night de
parted from Santa Fe, after con
ducting an eighteen-hour search in
the country north of Santa Fe, and
went to Albuquerque, N. M., to
meet Myron L. Sawyer, a brother-in-law,
of Fresno, Cal., where a fur
ther search for clues will be made.
Scores of persons, including Mex
icans, lured by the $100 reward,
yesterday searched the heavily tim
bered country along the- road be
tween Santa Fe and San Jose.
Friends of Armour in Sioux City
feel positive that he was a victim of
foul play. Armour on October 21
sent a postcard from Colorado
Springs, Colo., to a friend here.

Armour and her daughter reached
Fresno and becoming alarmed at the
