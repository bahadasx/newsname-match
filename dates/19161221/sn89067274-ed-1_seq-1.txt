MRS BEAL WORTHY MATRON.
Mrs. George Mathias, formerly of
this city, and two children, Richard 11,
and Eugene 8 faced want in St.
Louis this week when a thief stole
Mrs. Mathias' purse containing her
wageB. She had gone down town to
buy a few things for the boys' Christ
mas. Mr. Mathias, who was better
known here as George "Opera House,"
is in a tuberculosis hospital in Illinois,
with no hope of recovery.
The Mathias family reside on the
second floor of 1740 Mississippi ave.,
St. Louis, and she makes a living for
the little family by scrubbing. The
St. Louis Star published a story of
her unfortunate loss and that she was
ill and could not work; a number of
children and older people donated mon
ey and toys to brighten what promis
ed to be a black Christmas.
Mrs. Mathias was a Mexico girl, a
Miss Bedberry. Her husband waB stage
manaeer at the Grand Opera House
and universally liked by everyone. He
was energete and a hard worker. The
little family lived comfortably until
the father lost his health. Mrs. Ma
thias is a deserving woman and the
Ledger publishes her address so Mex
ico friends may aid if they so desire.
The employees of the local branch
factory of the International Shoe
Company may share in the $125,000
bonus which, according to the St. Lou
is Globe-Democrat, the company has
announced will be given the employes
in its branch factories. A. A. Galla
her, manager of the local branch, stat
ed Wednesday that he had received no
word as yet of the proposed bonus.
This company, the largest of its kind
in the West, and one of the largest in
the world, announced that about the
second of January a bonus of $125,
000 will be distributed among the em
ployes in its branch factories, which
are situated in cities in Illinois
and Missouri.
Beginning next week the employees
in tha St. Louis factory will receive
a weekly bonus in addition to their
salaries and the branch employes are
to receive their cash bonus early next
month. Several thousand people will
be affected by this decision.
J. W. Gallaher is home from Dallas,
Tpvnn. where he has been at the
bedside of his sister, Mrs. Timber-
lake, who is quite ill. Mr. Gallaher
reports shie is some better. Mrs. J.
Strief and daughter are in Dal

remain there throughout the holidays.
