Boys' State. Potato corneal win ciose

Send Prise Winner
Nebraska's banner potato county
should be well represented at this
show and more than this, the exhib
its should be the prizo-wlnning ones.
There Is no better way to advertise
Box Butte county to Nebraska and
the world than by competing at the
potato show and carrying away the
prises. If Box Butte county can Im
press the fact upon enough people
that this county Is the heart of the
most opulent potato growing region
n earth, that here in this county
one crop of potatoes irore than pays
for the land, every effort put forth
will be well paid. Every time a new
farmer learns of the great possibili
ties here and moves to Box Butte
county. Just that much is the value
of the land here enhanced. It Is a
business proposition a dollars and
eents proposition and should not be
neglected.
The Requirements
In order to compete In the potato
show twelve tubers of each variety
the cwner wishes to enter are re
quired. Every man or boy, every
father or son, every senior or mem
ber of the Boys' Potato Club who in
tended to aid himslef while aiding
Box Buite county to make a reputa
tion should get buoy at once prepar
ing for this big event. -How
to Prepare
Just whatto do will trouble some,
but it will not If each one will do as
suggested by Cbunty Agent Seidell
tn the following instruction: Pick
out at least two dozen of the best
tubers you ran find, keeping in mind
variety type desired, uniformity in
size and shape, skin firm and of good
texture, free from scab, etc., of the
proper color and size large enough
to Just lay nicely in the palm of the
ordinary hand. Then pack them in
some very dry sand If possible, or
light soil, and store them where the
temperature Is as cool as possible,

them. This will have a tendency to
bring back the natural color and
make the potatoes plump. Then not
later than January 12 the potatoes

Seidell, who will assist an wno ex
pect ot enter potatoes In the Bhow In
packing the best fifteen potatoes.

the potato show. .
Owner' Nam Attached
All entries will be entered with the
owner's name attached. Anyone
who desires to see the prize list can
do so by calling at the office of the
county agent.
The first session of the week will
begin on January 15, and sessions
will continue until January 19. All
who are Interested In going to the
show or In exhibiting their potatoes
should consult nt their first possible
convenience with the county agent
so arrangements can be made for a
Box Butte County Day.
If growers respond as they should
Box Butte county day- at the potato
show will be worth thousands of dol
lars to this county. There are only
five days for the. show, and if Box
Butte county can monopolize one
fifth of the time, or one day, It is
easy to see what the effect would
have on outsiders.
TO EXTEND PHONE LINE
Nebraska Telephone Company ath
ertng Information for New Toll
I J no to Broken Hour
- That Alllanm Is soon to have long
distance telephonic communication
with the sandhill country to the east
Is indicated by the fact that the Ne
braska Telephone Company has men
gathering Information and statistic
regarding the territory to be trav
ersed 'between this city and Broken
Bow.
Communication with eastern Ne
braska point by long distance tele
phone is had at the present time by
way of Bridgeport, Sidney. North
Platte and Grand Island. Toll lines
reach as far west on the Burlington
as Broken Bow. In order for a call
from Broken Bow to reach Alliance
It is necessary to talk via Grand Is
land, North Platte. Sidney . and
Bridgeport, a distance ot several
hundred miles farther than a direct
line from Alliance to Broken Bow.
A line directly east along the Bur
lington from Alliance would open up
rammunlcatlon with Lakeside. Antl-
och, Ellsworth. Bingham. Ashby,
Thedford. Mullen, Merna and other
points. A line extends as far east
as Ellsworth at this time but it is
not perfect service. ,
CARD OP THANKS
We wish to express our heartfelt
thanks to the kind friends .and
neighbors who lent aid and aaalst
'arice to us during the illness and
death of our beloved baby boy.
Mr. and Mrs. Merbert H. Hughes.
PROBLEM OF FINANCING
THE COUNTY AGENT WORK
County Must Make Appropriation if Work Isto Be Continued Sev-
eral Counties Have Already Provided Fund Those
Who Contributed Locally
At the annual meeting of the .Box
Butte Farmers' Association held in j
contlnuo the county agent work pro
vided the necessary funds were se
cured with which to continue this
work. Arrangements were made
with County Agent F. M. Seidell to
superintend the work for the com
iug year. The next important item
on the program is the securing of
the necessaiy funds.
' Moitt Essential Part
The hardest and yet the most es
sential part of supporting the county j
agent work is the financing. In the
first place, the federal department
and the state of Nebraska pay direct
ly to the county agent $1,200 of his
salary. In order to start the work
in a new county It Is necessary to
raise a minimum sum to equal the
amount put up by the state and nat
ional governments.
Make Appropriations
. The work was started in Box I
Butte county in the manner related j
'-bove. The fund was raised bys
membership fees of $5 and to make!
up the deficit subscriptions were se
cured to amounts as large as it was
possible to secure. A sufficient sum
of money pledged and unpaid re-j
mains to nmsn mis year a worn.
However, from now on there will be
no work conducted where the coun
ty doeB not make an appropriation.
Butler county has lust organized on
this basis and Sheridan county did J
so last spring. , Dawes and Kimball ;
counties make appropriations and
about $2,400 for the work. Previous
to the November election a petition
was circulated over the county and
stgneu by land owners asking the
board of commissioners of Box Butte
county to make an appropriation to
keep this work gonlg. The petition
was signed by most of the land own
ers. Treasurer Iteports
W. F. Patterson, treasurer of the
Box Butte Farmers' Association, re
ports that during the period from
February 1. 1815. to December 16.
1916. Inclusive, there had been paid
In and receipted for the sum of $2,
660.25, and cash paid in and not re
ceipted for to teh amount of $20.
The total cash paid In amounts to
$2,560.25. A total of $2,509.70 was
paid out. Tho cash in the banks as
per statements is $70.55. All bills
were paid up to and Including the
first of November. The estimate of
funds necessary to take care of Nov
ember and December is $235, mak
ing it necessary to collect in at least
$165 before January 1. Some pay
ments were made at the various
banks In the county, some to the
treasurer In person, some mailed to
the Box Butte Farmers' Association
and some paid to the office assistant
in the office of the county agent, to
the Commercial Club secretary and
to the county agent. ,

Pr.KSENT IN ALLLtNCK
Local veterinarians have reported
to the county scent that a typical
case of sore mouth or infectious sto-
mlnltts has appeared In the vicinity
of 619 Missouri avenue, this city.
This diseae will be remembered by
many as the cause of the last foot-and-mouth
disease scare that appear
ed In all the livestock papers of thlp
state. It Is not a serious disease,
but it certainly is not best to spread
it. The case has been reported to
the state authorities, who probably
will not place a quarantine. Owner
of livestock are. however, Interested
;in preventing Its spread.
Frank A. May of Omaha, commer
cial superintendent of the Nebraska
Telephone Company, stopped over In
Alliance Monday and Tuesday of this
week. Mr. May was formerly the
' district sunerintendent for the dis
trict In which Alliance was located.
with headquraters at Grand Island.

ition In November.
