This year we have chosen a pro
gram which we believe is in keeping
t/ith the first Christmas celebrated
earth. John 3:16, "For God so
loved the world that he gave His
only begotten son."
The first great thought being
"others." So we will give white
gifts for our King, Jesus Christ.
White gifts may be of "Self, ser
vice or substance," just so it is un
tainted by any self-interest. An op
portunity will be given that each
person prestent may give one or all
-of these.
Each pupil is expected to bring a
gift wrapped in white. These may
be fruit, groceries, clothing, toys or
money. They will be used to bring
joy. comfort and happiness to "oth
ers" here in Bemidji.

ed 126 adcUtional names signed to
the/ membership roll, bringing up the
total to the 227 mark, whereat Presi
dent E. E. McDonald, who was in the
chair, smiled broadly.
C. M. Jacobston, for the committee
on toboggan and skiing, stated that
the cost of erecting the toboggan
slide would entail an expenditure of
$150 instead of the.estimated $100
and he was instructed to go ahead
and spend the additional $50.
It was decided to allow the chil
dren of Bemidji to join the associa
tion and for the little people a mem
bership fee of 50 cents*, will be
charged, half the membership of
their eiders. But no youngster of
Bemidji is to be left out of the sport
of the association and all children
who are not able to afford the fifty
cents may join"and pay their dues by
helping keep the rinka clear of snow
and do other little things incident
to the conduct of the association.
It was also decided to obtain a
suitable badge to be worn by mem
bers, of the association.

iPUT UP MORROW
Dressed to. withstand cold that
would drop the mercury out the bot
tbin of the tube, F. S. Lycan and
James Black le,ft. this morning on a
much coveted Christmas* tree tfiajt is
to shine for all-of Bemidji. Thisiaf
ternoon, Alderman Tom Smart will
haul the tree into the city as his part
of the Christmas festival and Super
intendent A. W Johnson of the
Minnesota Electric Light & Power
company will see that the tree is*
properly eltctrically lighted as the
light company's part in the affair.
The wires and lights will be placed
on the tree tomorrow before its erec
tion.
Mr. Lycan was busily engaged in
watching the fire, fearing it might
get a notion to hop across the street
and attack.the Markham hotel, but
as he was ready to leave and happen
ed to meet Mayor Vandersluis, the
mayor agreed, to watch the Mark
ham and allow Mr. Lycan to hike out
in the col* and get the tree, all of
which was real nice in hizzoner, as
a representative of the Pioneer had
iuBt previously declined a cordial in
vitation of Mr. Lycan to go out and
get an ear froze, which Wrould indeed
be very ear-itating.
The tree will be erected at the foot
of Third'street, on the lake and con
venient to accommodate the throngs
that"are sure to participate in a com
munity Observation of Christmas.
PLAN WIND SCBEEN.
Members of the skating rink, com
mittee are planning to secure a big
load of balsam and small pine trees
to "plant" in the snow bank around
the rink, thus affording a shelter to
the skaters. The plan has been
worked out very successfully in other
cities.
COMMUNITY XMAS
i URGED FOR BEMIDJI
The following communication'was
received by the Pioneer from one of
Bemidji's best known women with
the request that it be given space and
the Pioneer gladly does so:
"With a municipal Christmas tree
assured for Bemidji this year, we can
make this* Christmas a celebration
worthy of the joyous and solemn sea
son, a public recognition that the
spirit of Christmas demands commu
nity good will as well as individual
happiness.
"Everybody in the city can snare,
for one part of the community
Christmas, celebration is to make the
city brilliant and beautiful with
lights on .Christmas) eve. A candle
in the window will show that the
Christmas spirit dwells within, and
will be a message of good cheer to
those in the street. A city lit. up to
celebrate a human spirit of kindli
ness is a beautiful thing.
"So let every one. in Bemidji rer
member on Christina* eve, to place a
lighted candle in the window of your
home, being careful to set where
there will be no danger of a fire from
it."

Fire of uncertain origin this morn

story frame building owned by John
A. Dalton of Bemidji, located at the
southwest corner of Beltrami avenue
and Third street, removing from the
business district one of the pioneer
buildings of the city. Its* location
was in the heart of the business cen
ter of Bemidji and has stood for
years, a monument of "other days."
Origin Uncertain.
The start of the fire is not known,
but originated in the restaurant
which: occupied the rear portion of
the structure, the front of the ground
floor being vacant. It was about 8
o'clock when what resembled an ex
plosion occurred, so it is* said, and
in an instant the interior of the
place broke into flames. Sponta
neous combustion is the opinion of
those present at the time of the mis
hap.
The fire department was quickly
notified and was promptly on the
scene, the mercury hovering around
the 20 degrees below zero mark
rendering the work of the volunteers
trying.
Interior in Flames.
The interior of the structure was
burning fiercely, the frame material
furnishing excellent food for the
flames. Ladders were shunted up

pany were moved to safety.
Burned Structure Frame.
The Dalton building was of frame
but had a brick front, it having been
installed two years ago at the time
of a fire. The front part of the
ground floor was unoccupied, a saloon
going out of business when legalized
liquor selling was given a knockout
in Bemidji. Back of this and front
ing on Beltrami avenue wasi the res
taurant.
Valued at $6,000.
The building was valued at about
$6,000 and was insured for $4,500.
The contents carried $2,500 insur
ance.
Save O'Leary Store.
When it was seen that the build
ing could not be saved, the firemen
turned their attention to saving the
O'Leary-Bowser building from seri
ous damage and possible destruction
and two leads of hose were sent into
action on the side next to the Dalton
building. It was about 10 o'clock
when with a loud blast the terrific
heat blew out the front plate front
of the Dalton building and the east
wall went down in charred mass,
caving inward. An excellent piece
of judgment on the part Of the fire
men was the saving of the water for
any possible spread of the flames to
other business houses, and slowly
but surely the old frame structure
went down and out, a black heap of
timber and frame construction.
Interesting History.
What has become to be known as
the Dalton building was built in
1894 by O. P. Carson and M. E. Car
son for a general store in the pioneer
days of Bemidji. It was erected for
a general store and was one of the
first to be built in Bemidji and was
known throughout this part of Min
nesota, being a big trading center.
It occupied ground space 25x90 feet.
The building was sold in 1899 to
Edward Rose who sold it to a man
who' bought the Markham hotel and
traded in the building on the deal.
Later the same man sold the hotel
back to its former owner and again
took over the building.
Passes to Dalton.
Next, the building was sold to a
man from Wisconsin and then passed
into the possession of Mr. Dalton. It
became a saloon after Carson Bros,
sold it and the upBtairs portion be
came a rooming house.
Where the restaurant was located,
used to be the stable.which was re
modeled for business purposes*.
It is believed that Mr. Dalton will
replace the burned building with a
modern brick structure which will
add greatly to the business' district
of the city, as the corner Is one of
the most prominent in the business
district.l
