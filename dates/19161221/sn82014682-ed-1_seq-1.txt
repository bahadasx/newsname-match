AVERT POSSIBLE I'JAfi, HE SAYS
: (Aaiate4 Pmi 5rira Sy Fdral Wralaa
WASHINGTON. D. C Dec. 2t. Supplementing his statement earlier
in the day about the danger of the United States being drawn into war.
Secretary Lansing' adds an amplifying and-qualifying comment. He says,
he feared some incorrect inferences would be drawn from the first state
ment, and that he wants to make it clear that there? is no change in the pol
icy -of the United States and that the notes in no sense are to be con
strued as threats. toward any governments.
WAIIIXnTO.V. I). ('., Dee. 21 . lVesiilent Wilson move last
iijirkt1 in calling upon the warringr
-tut possible terms of peace, was a
ft he 1 nited Mates involved. '
This statement was authorized today by Seeretary of State
Lansinp." ; ::.y : :
It was made plain.: on behalf of the administration, that, the
danger of the I'uited. Static being drawn into the war, and thv
increasingly eritieal positioii of this country as a neutral,cojistitutetl ,
one Sf the moving considerations for the president's notes. .
Secretary Lansing, in his statement, declares that the material
rights of the United States have not been thi paramount con
sideration. :: -: "--Cf.'.. . - : . V V."' ' t .''
r -He says that America's rights were being more and raon;' in
volved; that the United States was "drawing nearer to the verge
of war," and that the country and the .government We entitled to
know exactly what' each belligerent seeks ' in order that we may
rrgulate our conduct in the future.'
- Mr. Lansing's statement continues that the president's move
"indicates the possibility of our being forced into the war.' That
possibility, he pointed out, ought to serve as. a restraining and
sobering forei in safeguarding American rights. It Jnay also serve,
he emphasized, 'as a force for the earlier conclusion of the war. ;
"Neither the presidentnor myself regards the note as a peace
note," he said significantly. "It is merely an effort to get the
belligerents to define the end for which they are fighting."
; All AVashington, every circle of diplomacy, legislation, business
and society, is startled with the news of the president's action and
the possibilities-it portends." . ; ! '.: ' V
A resolution "strongly indorsing" the president's note "was of
fered in the tipper house today for immediate action but was sent
