That is the Real Reason for
President Wilson's Notes to
the Belligerent Nations.
REASONS ARE~MADE PUBLICj
United States Wants to Know!
Exactly What Each Nation
is Seeking.
<?Y A#IOCtAT CO PMII) '
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.?The j
danger of the United States itself be- |
ing drawn into the war by reason of
its increasingly critical position as a
neutral was one of the moving con-j
siderations in President Wilson's de- j
spatch of notes to all the belligerents,;
urging them to discuss terms of;
peace.
Secretary Lansing Thursday authorized
the statement that the material
right of the United States had .
not been the paramount consideration.
America's rights, he said, were
being more and more involved by
the belligerents and as the United
States was "drawing nearer the verge
of war," It was entitled to know exactly
what each belligerent seeks "in
order that we may regulate our conduct
in the future."
Secretary Lansing's statement, upon
which the White House refused
to comment was as follows:
"The reasons for sending the notes
were as follows:
"It isn't our material interest we
had in mind when the note was sent, "
but more and more our own rights
of becoming involved by the belligerents
on both sides r.o that the situa- ,
tion is becoming increasingly critical. <
"I mean bv that that we are draw
ing nearer the verge of -war ourselves,
and therefore we are entitled
to know exactly what each belliger- ,
ent seeks in order that we may reg- '
ulate our conduct in the future. .
"No nation has been sounded. No '
consideration of the German over- ,
tures or of the speech of Lloyd- \
George was taken into account in the ]
formulation of the document. The
only thing the overtures did was to j
delay it a few days. It was not de- (
cided to send it until Monday. Of ?
yW course, the difficulties that faced the j
, president were that it might be con- ,
strued as a movement towards peace (
. and in aid of the German overtures.
He specifically denies that that was ]
the fact in the document itself." i
At. the White House no effort was ^
made to lessen the importance of Sec- (
retary Lansing's statement. Presi- ]
8 dent Wilson would make no comment. ?
President Wilson himself on several J
occasions has pointed out the danger
of the United States becoming involved
in the war. Because of violations
of American rights he has felt
that the United 'States had a very
difficult role to fill.
Last February while touring the |
middle "West in favor of preparedness
! and again during the last campaign,
the president touched on that feature,
i.. In a speech at Pittsburg last January
he said:
"WTien you know that there are com- <
bustible materials in the life of the ?
world and In your own national lne ]
and that the sky is full of floating ]
sparks from a great conflagration, are |'
you gomg to sa uuw u uuu. soj 11. v?ni
lime when the Are is out to begin to do i
something? I do not believe that the j
Are is going to begin, but I would be ,
sure of it if we were ready for the
fire."
Again at Cleveland, O., the president
declared: j
"Two-thirds o fthe world are at .
war. It is not merely an European ,
struggle; nations in the Orient have ^
become involved as nations in the
West, and everywhere there seems to
be creeping upon the nations disengaged
the spirit and the threat of.
war. All the world aside from America
is on fire." .
In one of his campaign speeches ;|
the president declared that the present
was the last great war in which
the United States could remain neutral.
He said on that occasion that
the interests or the world were so
g drawn together that it was difficult '
ff for anyone of the nations to remain 1
If neutral when the others were at war. l

In the Icy Waters of Elk Creek
When the Jce Gives Way
While Crossing Creek.
W. iHehryWine, aged 77 years, Is in
a,critical.condition at the home of his
daughter, Mrs. Louis DelBon, 606 Monticello
avenue, as a result of being in
the icy waters of Elk creek for an hour
Thursday morning. Attending physicians
stated Thursday afternoon that he
had a chance to recover.
Mr. "Wine was going from the home
of a son on' Water Btreet to his daughter's
home on the avenue. He decided
to take a short cut and go across the
creek on the ice. He was about -half
way across the creek when the ice
gave way and he sank Into the creek.
At the point where he went through,
the water was over his head and when
he came up he seized a piece of board
lying on the Ice near me place where
he went down and holding himself up
he called for help. In a short time a
crowd began to gather on both banks
of the creek but no one would venture
out to try to save the aged man, who
was suffering greatly from - the cold
water.
Several persons hurried to secure
ropes and boards to throw out to him
but by. the time they arrived he was '
too weak to help himself and still ho
one in the crowd had nerve enough to
go out and help htm out of the water.
Some one called-the Central Are department
and in responding to the
call it went down Water street. By the
time the 'fire department arrived on
the scene, Theodore Aspliind and i
Dorsey Fordyce,: two men who work in
the Wilson bakery-near the scene of
the accident, arrivediand'at once; Mr.
Asplund went out on the ice and jumping
into the icy water lifted Mr. Wine
up to Fordycc, who placed him on a ;
largo board they had brought from the
bakery with them and he was carried
to the shore.
He' was immediately taken to, the
home of his daughter where medical
aid was waiting for him. At first the
attending physican said me could, not
recover but-later his condition changed
and.it is though that he will recover.
His hands were badly frozen where he
had been holding onto the board and
the edge of the ice to keep from
drowning. The old man made a game
ngnt'ior his life and showed much
more courage than a number of persons
who stood on the^ bank/afraid to
venture out* on the Ice to save him.
