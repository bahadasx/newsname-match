STOP, LOOK, LISTEN! WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE TO HELP THE NORMAL?
What have you done to help secure the passage of the
normal school bill?
Have you attempted to secure the support of your
friends over the state?
Every man, woman and child in Pendleton undoubted
ly has from one to a score of voting friends outside of this
city to whom a word of suggestion would be all that is
necessary.
The campaign committee has printed a great many
folders which set out briefly the arguments for the loca
tion of a normal school in this city. These folders will be
p-ladly furnished to all who call at the office of Secretary
J. H. Gwinn at the Pendleton Abstract Company. A
folder enclosed in each letter going out over the state
would be most effective. If you do not wish to write a
letter, write a few words on the margin of the folder and
address it to a friend.
It is not opposition that will kill the measure. There
is no organized opposition to it except what comes from
Weston. If the amendment is defeated, it will be defeat
ed by indifference. There are many voters who do not
care enough about the measure to apprise themselves of
its provisions These voters as a rule vote No. A simple
word from a friend would change their vote to Yes.
Pendleton citizens have it in their power to change
thousands of votes, and they at least cannot afford to be '
indifferent.
If you are loyal to Pendleton, Umatilla county and east
ern Oregon you will send out the information that has
been prepared.
DO IT TODAY.
