There Was Xo Wedding.
The boy and girl were not married
Tuesday night. The boy went to the
home of his aunt and uncle and they
took up the fight for him today.
"It is a shame." said the aunt, a sis
ter of the boy's dead mother.
"Repps Read cast that boy off as soon
as his wife was dead and has done
nothing for him since except to cuff
him around. He has made his home

child and it is ridiculous to try to
fasten such a charge upon him."

I wouldn't marry that girl for ail the

His Mother Is Dead.
Eugene Read's mother died in the
state hospital. Eugene was just a boy
and, without a home, he got into trou
ble. He was sent to the state reform
atory from which he was released last
January. His father married Hattie
Adams, a sister of the girl who is
making the accusation against Eu
gene, while he was in the reformatory.
The boy told where he had worked
and lived since he left the reforma
tory. He spent two weeks at the
Adams home this summer and admits
it. But he denies that he knew or had
had anything to do with Mary Adams

"The first time I was ever alone
with that girl, or ever paid any at

County officers sent out today for
Adams and Read, the two fathers, and
Mary Adams. They want to know

is on trial charged with the murder of

ernoon whether he trial will proceed.

I regarding the alleged newspaper in-
terview with Attorney General John
r. Barker, senior counsel for the state.
In which the attorney general was
quoted as having said that the state
had been "Jobbed in the selection of
the venire, made an announcement to
that effect when court convened this
morning.
Mr. McDaniel's attorneys declared
today they desired the case to go to an
immediate conclusion. State's counsel
wished, according to Mr. Barker, to
consider the incident closed.
The continuance until afternoon was
the fourth that has marked the trial
since it was called a week ago today.
St. Joseph, Mo., Oct. 25. Upon a
decision of Judge Thomas F. Ryan,
judge of the criminal court here, de
pends today the continuance of the
trial of Oscar D. McDaniel, prosecut
ing attorney of Buchanan county, who
is charged with the murder of his
wife, Mrs. Harriet Moss-McDaniel.
Judge Ryan is expected when court
reconvenes this morn.ng to decide
whether or not the veniremen already
selected have been prejudiced so that
an Impartial verdict is impossible be
cause of a news story published in a
St. Joseph newspaper yesterday. A
decision that the veniremen might be
come prejudiced would mean their
dismissal and a continuance of the
trial until the November term of court,
starting two weeks from yesterday!
when a new panel would be drawn, at
torneys explained.
The news story, which was objected
to by Judge C. F. Strop, senor counsel
for the defense, was quoted by Judge
Strop as declaring that John T. Bark

of the state's attorneys had said the
state had been "jobbed" by the selec

the trial jury will be chosen. The tilt
which occurred yesterday when Judge
Strop arose In court with his objec

Work Will Begin Soon on Addi
tional Structure.
THE COST WILL BE $120,000
Two Hundred Employes Hare
Been Added Here.
President and Party to Topeka
Tomorrow.
Following rapid expansion in the
last few years of the departments
housed by the Santa Fe general office
buildings here, it was officially an
nounced today that three more stories
will be added to the new building,
now ten stories high, between Ninth
street and Tenth avenue on Jackson.
The announcement is made by Fred
C. Fox, general manager of eastern
lines. Mr. Fox received word today
from W. B. Storey, vice president in
charge of operation, that general
plans drawn in Topeka for the three
additional stories have been approv
ed in Chicago.
The communication authorized Mr.
Fox to go ahead with plans for the
additional stories. They will cost
J120.000.
It was said from the general mana
ger's office today that actual work on
the improvement will probably not be
gin before, spring because of approach
ing winter. However, it is said, pre
paratory plans will be entirely finished
by that time and construction work
will begin then.
Departments Grow.
Expansion of the different depart
ments here is given as the cause of the
construction of the additional stories.
When the original plans for the new
building here were drawn they pro
vided for thirteen stories, excluding
the basement. Later the 13-story idea
was temporarily discarded and the
building made a 10 -story structure
which was completed in 1910 at a
cost of $375,000.
Then it was believed the 10-story
building would be adequate for years
to come. However, in six years more
than 200 men have been added to de
partments here and the two buildings
are too congested, it is said, for con
venience. The building of the three additional
stories will probably mean a general
revision of the location of depart
ments. Those now much congested
will be afforded the required space.
Altho details have not been worked
out as to just -what departments will
occupy the new rooms they will be
probably before the building Is fin
ished. Of Same Material.
The three additional stories will be
of tho same material as the present
structure. The design and arrange
ment of the rooms will be the same
as the other floors.
Detailed plans will be completed
this winter probably and the contract
let.
The addition announced today is
considered in railroad circles as fur
ther recognition of Topeka's growing
importance as a railroad center. The
Santa Fe general offices, when the
improvement is completed, will be
among the largest in the country.
Stockholders' Meeting.
Stockholders of the Santa Fe rail
road, including many prominent finan
ciers and officials fr m several parts
of the country, will be in Topeka
Thursday for their annual meeting
which begins at noon in the office of
E. L. Copeland, treasurer. Prominent
among those attending will be a party
of officials from Chicago headed by
E. P. Ripley, president of the Santa
Fe and dean of American railroad ex
ecutives. Vice President Storey,
Chambers and Hodges will be in the
party which will arrive here tomor
row morning. While here President
Ripley and his party will inspect the
big headquarters shops in Topeka, it
was said today. The Santa Fe execu
tive always makes such an inspection
when here for the meetings.
Four directors of the road will be
elected. The terms of Edwin J. Ber
wind New York; Homer Stillwell,
Chicago: Henry C. Frick, Pittsburg,
Pa.; and Andrew u. uoues, wiciiiam,
Kan., expire. All four of those men
are scheduled for re-election.
Taking on More Mileage.
Annisition of the Crosbyton-South-
plains railroad, running between Lub
bock and Crosbyton, Tex., a distance
of 38.45 miles, will be ratified, as will
the acquisition of the Laton & West
ern railway, running between Laton
and Riverdale, Cal.. a distance of
17 57 miles. The owners of the capi
tal stock of the latter road have
turned it over to the Santa Fe to se.
cure future operation of the road.
One-half interest in the Oil City
branch of the Southern Pacific in Cal
ifornia is to be acquired for the sum
of J168.794. The interest in the line
is being purchased in order to gain ac
cess to the rich Kern county oil fields.
wh"re the company has considerable
prcperty from which it is drawing fuel

debtedness of the Dodge City & Cimar
ron Valley railway in Kansas and the
road has been leased for the sake of
convenience and economy in opera
tion. The lease is to be ratified in
the stockholders' meeting tomorrow.
Ratification of Expenditure.
Ratification of the use of J4, 800, 000
of Atchison preferred stock, deposited
with the Union Trust company for ex
penditures and improvements made
prior and subsequent to October 26,

auditors to audit the books of the
company, at the close of the fiscal year
will also be elected. The meeting is
the twenty-first annual one of the
company.
The majority of the stock, at the
meeting, will be represented by proxy.

Caylor to Santa Fe.
Mr. Jarrell today announced the ap
pointment of Harry E. Caylor, who
has been writing railroad news for the
State Journal, to be a representative
of the Earth, effective November 1.
Mr. Caylor is regarded as one of the
most capable railroad reporters in the
west. He received his newspaper
education on the fetate Journal; but
also has done work on the Kansas City
Star.
"The mission of the Earth," said
Vice President Chambers, "is to aid in
the development of the territory
served by the Santa Fe. Its circula
tion is used especially in the north,
east and south to direct the attention
cf homeseekers and other desirable
investors to the advantages offered by
Santa Fe communities. Our publicity
representatives write up these ad
vantages for the Earth, and the paper
then goes on its mission to be read in
other states by people who are looking
for moderate priced lands, attractive
business opportunities, or a better
climate. This service to Santa Fe
communities is free a part of the
Santa Fe's scheme of co-operating
with its patrons in general community
development. The Earth also will be
used as a medium for giving publicity
to the demonstration and experiment
work our industrial department is con
ducting the year around, especially
that having to do with agriculture and
stock raising."
F. L. Vandegrift, who has been edi
tor of the Earth for several years, will
retire from the paper to take up a
line of work having to do with legis
lative matters, it is said. Mr. Vande
grift probably knows more about leg-
islatures and legislative procedure
! than any other man in Kansas. He
J likely will be in Topeka this winter.

WRECK SUBWAY DEPOT
Bomb Early In Day Snpposod to Have
Been Set Off by Strikers.
New York, Oct. 25. Explosion of
a bomb of dynamite at the 110th
street station of the Lenox avenue
subway line early today did consid
erable damage to that station, smash
ed the ticket agent's booth, injured the
Egent slightly, broke the electric lamps
and windows in the kiosks, tore off a
portion of the sidewalk overhead and
broke the windows in some of the
apartment houses nearby.
There was no train at the station
or near it at the moment. Traffic in
the subway was suspended for half
an hour or more as the result of the
blast. Subway employes at that sta
tion said they saw no one loitering
about and did not know how the ex
plosive was brought into the station.
The only theory they could suggest
was that It might have been set off
because of the street railway strike
which has been in progress since early
in September.
Later police reports showed that
four persons were injured. Inspector
O wen Egan of the bureau of com
bustibles said the explosive was a
bomb containing high power dyna
mite. It was placed under the edge
of the platform and not on the tracks
as at first reported. A subway train
carrying passengers had left the sta
tion two minutes before the explosion.

French Reoccupy Douaumont
Village and Fortress.
Paris, Oct. 25. Two violent Ger
man counter-attacks were delivered
last night and this morning against
the position on the Haudromont-Dam-loup
line northeast of Verd n, won by
the French in yesterday's great as
sault. Both attacks failed, the French
maintaining all their positions, it was
officially announced today. The
French spent the night cleaning up
Fort Douaumont, captured from the
Germans yesterday. Among the 3,500
prisoners is the German commander
of Fort Douaumont.
Paris, Oct. 25. German reinforce
ments are being rushed up to the Ver
dun front to meet the new French of
fensive, according to advices from the
front today. In response to the crown
nrinm'a anneal for help the Teutons
are shifting regiments back from the
Somme to the Verdun front, tierman
units from the Somme battlefield ar
rived before Verdun yesterday while
the French were smashing their way
northward, but too late to take part
in the day's action.
General Nivelle's lightning stroke
northwest of Verdun yesterday ac
complished a two-fold purpose. It
definitely removed the German
menace to Verdun and it halted the
massing of a huge German army on
the Bapaume-Peronne line for a great
counter attack on the Somme.
Germans Still Hold Vaux Fort.
The German lines were thrown back
two miles at the point where they
had made their nearest approach to
Verdun. Fort Douamount, the village
of Douaumont, and other positions
were captured. The battered Fort
Vaux. surmounting a hill southeast of
Douaumont is "OHonly Important
work on the northeast front of Ver
dun remaining in German hands.
A terrific artillery duel east of the
Meuse gave Paris an inkling that Im
portant infantry actions were ap
proaching on the Verdun front. It is
believed here that the Germans mis
calculated the strength of General
Nivelle's forces and stripped their
Verdun lines past the danger point to
prepare for a counter attack on the
Somme. While the troop shifting was
in progress French guns began tuning
up and French infantry struck before
the German regiments could be re
called from the Somme.
WHEAT JOARING
Started Off Today With 5 Cents
a Bushel Jump.
Drouth Destroys Much of Ar
gentina's Crop.
Chicago. Oct 25. Giant upward
swings in the wheat market today car
ried prices more than 5 cents a bushel
above yesterday's closing figures. The
December delivery quickly touched
$1.83 today as against $1.78 to
$1.78 at the finish the day before.
Buying which was on an immense
scale, received its chief impetus from
reports that the drouth damage in
Argentina had assumed the propor
tion of a disaster, and was continuing
to grow worse.
Just before noon, the market had
advanced to $1.84 for December and
$1.83 for May, approaching the
maximum of $1.85 during the Leiter
ccrner in 1898.
No Relief From Argentina,
Buenos Aires, Oct. 25. A severe
drouth that threatens severe damage
to the Argentine wheat crop has boost
ed wheat prices out of sight and has
killed all chances that the United
States may obtain relief from rising
flour prices from Argentine shipments.
Wheat sold at 15 pesos per hundred
kilos yesterday, a new record on the
Buenos Aires market.
Experts say that a prolongation of
the present drouth for a fortnight will
destroy three-fourths of the crop.
Thousands of cattle are dying for lack
of fodder. Little wheat was shipped
to the United States from Argentina
The Argentine surplus was sold large
ly in European countries which must
make larger requisition upon the
United States, If the Argentine surplus
is wiped out by the drouth.

announced today. The inspection trip
which was to have started from here
this morning was for the purpose of
investigating the plan to eliminate the
periodical flood conditions which
threaten the valleys of the Kansas riv

Plan to Prevent Spread of Dis
ease in Eating Places.
TO BUTCHERS AND BAKERS
Stringent Rule Will Be Applied
for Sanitation.
Packing House Employes Are
Already Examined.
Enters now hygienic waiters and
cooks into Kansas. A physician's cer
tificate of the hygienic qualities of
waiters and cooks Is a request of Leon
A. Congdon, state hotel commissioner,
after today.
Probably after the meeting of the
Kansas state legislature such certifi
cates will be a demand of the hotel
commissioner, backed by the statutes
of Kansas. The state board of health
intends to have a legislator introduce
a bill demanding physicians' certifi
cates indicating that not only waiters
and cooks are free from communica
ble and infectious diseases but butch
ers, bakers and handlers of fruit as
well.
However, for the present, Mr. Cong
don intends to devote his entire time
to cooks and waiters. Fifty thousand
health certificates, in blank form, will
be mailed from his office this week,
to hotel and restaurant proprietors in
every city, town and hamlet in Kan
sas sporting either cook or waiter.
Hang Certificates In Hotels.
The cards to be filled out by physi
cians will certify that the person ex
amined is free from communicable
and infectious diseases. Two cards
must be filled out, one for Mr. Cong
don and one for the proprietor to
frame In the dining room or have
ready for emergencies in case guests
desire to have their food and drink
served by hygienic employes.
we cannot enlorce this request at
present," said Mr. Congdon. "How
ever, it will be a great safeguard for
proprietors. ir a man comes into
my office with a complaint that he
contracted a disease in a hotel or res
taurant, presumably thru the handling
of food by an employe suffering from
a communicable or infectious disease,
we can get the data, he oelieves the
disease was contracted. If we have a
certificate showing that the employe
was examined and found free from
such diseases the complainant hasn't
much of a -case. Then, too, guests
should demand to see such certificates
hung in conspicuous places in hotels
and restaurants," - -
Perfect health of waiters and cooks
is more essential than in butcher and
bakers, is the opinion of Mr. Congdon,
because cooks and waiters handle food
after it is cooked while the others
