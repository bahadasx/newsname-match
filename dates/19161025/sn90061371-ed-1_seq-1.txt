The land bank scheme woold
furnish another long list ef Jobs
lor politicians.
President Wilson says now that
he might fight if bin dog were

only WtcUd aroand,

mon Uoaa at the, coming election
by adopting the aUto wide pro
hlbitlon amendment.
It has already coat the United
States $100,000,000 to maintain
au army on the Mexican border.
And he kept os out of war.
The breweries and the Demo
cratic leaders In Missouri seem
to be working together s bar
monloualy as usaal this year.
It would be interesting wen
the railroads to accept the new b
hour law literally, and cotnpe!
their trainmen to quit when they
had worked eight hour.
Col. Gardner will voto ngainst
himself If ho votes as he talks.

a million or two safely tucked

None of our state officials have
rts ponded te JudgeLareiaTa chal
lengc to come forward and show
just what the state owes to the
StBte University and other insti
tut ions. Why? Because they
afraid to speak the trnth.
Lirg flocks of wild g-ese di
tnrfeod t!i peace and serenity of
JefTersne 1'ity on night last
week. The nnlp large floi ks 'f
Republican veWs are making is
also keeping a good many people
there awake these nights.
Out of seventy five Democratic
editors of Missouri called upn
f ; a political ihw wow at Jeffer
son City last Friday, only sixUcn
responded (treat enthusiasm
wcvatls in the Missouri Democ
racy this year, especially among
the !)ancratlc editors.
We want to say a good word
for the Republican coant J ticket.
The candidates on that ticket are
honorable cltiwos and competent
men. They were nominated by
Hpular vote and should have the
full support of tho party. 11
every Republican vote for the
nominees of his party.
Oil. Gardner says that if he is
started governor ho will see to it
that Missouri is given a business
administration, and lll stop the
leaks. This ItKxit good deal
like a confession that the Major
Administration is not a bastness
one and that there am leaks to be
a topped. Ijel us try a chang of
party aid see how that works.
The Master Rakers' Associa
tlon of Chicago is appealing K
President Wilson to check the
soaring prices of wheat. That
won't do any good, for Mr. Wil
son will check nothing that would
tend to check thu lighting effi
ciency of the Allies, let It affect
Americi.os as it may. We are
feeding the war In Europe In or
der to fatten up Democratic
"prosperity" in this coundy.
Our Democratic exchanges evi
dently place a low estimate upen
the intelligence of their readers,
for they do not even He consist
ently In their efforts to mislead
them. For iastanoe, last week's
1 ronton Register had a cartoon
depicting Mr. Hughes wearing
the Kaiser's helmet, while in the
editorial column It was asserted
that were Hughes president he
