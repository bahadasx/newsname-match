BELIEVE POSCHL
CREMATED SELF
Remorse Over Fancied Sins
Regarded as Motive for Act.
That Frank Poschi, the Marlboro, Md.,
farmer, whose charred body was found In
the ashes of a brush-fire near Forest
villa. Md., on Sunday, cremated himself
in a fit of remorse over what he believed
were unpardonable acts he had commit
ted during his lifetime, is the startling
new theory developed by Prince George
County authorities.
This theory is founded on the testi
mony of various friends of the dead man
Who declare that he had frequently hinted
at a desire to burn himself to death. One
woman. who was intimately acquainted
with Poschl. said he once remarked to
her:
"I have committed the unforgivable sin,
and if it wasn't so Inhuman Id crawl
under a burning brush-pile to get that I
sin off my mind.
Poechl was a man of intense piety and
of a religious and superstitious turn of
mind. He had been apparently obsessed I
for some time, it is said, by the con- t
sciousness of some sin which he believed
he had committed and thought beyond
possibility of forgiveness.
Theory Is Strengfthened.

tengthen the theory of self-crematIon. 'e
Hr is said to have stated that his only t
atonement could be by fire.
Opposed to this theory is the fact that
the ash heap where the body of the dead I
man was fo;,nd conta!ned several partly- I
hbrned 12-gaug' shotgun shells. Sheriff I
Henry Gates said last nilht that he was a
not ready to accept as tinal the suirid

PRICES ON ALL BREAD

Six-cent bread by November 1 is the

:ast night

Bern's bakery, the Boston Baking

and the Charles Schneider Baking Com-!
par., are among those who have either
(cided to raise their price or at least t
contemplate doing . t
This latest move of the bakers has
been threatening for some time." says
Manager Gleason of the Boston Baking
Company, "as articles used in the mak
Inr of bread have advanced to such an
extent that it is almost impossible to t
operate under the present prfees." c
"We have gone through every cost
record we have,' said a big baker yes
terday. "and we find that in everything I
we have to buy to keep our plant running t
the cost has Increased. This includes all I
articles. from horseshoes to flour by the
carload. In some instances the cost of r
manufacturing ne-essities has increased i
20) per cent. The average increase in the!
cost of things we have to buy to produce!
and deliver a loaf of bread is 70 per cent
t When the woman who pays 6 cents a
loaf for bread understands that she is
paying an increase of 20 per cent while
the baker Is paying an increase of 70 per
cent, I do not think there will be much
criiz ism."
