commend him. lie is a cultured gen
tleman, a beautiful Christian charac

about the greatest preacher is the
great message he brings. If you love

If you are unsaved and believe you
have a soul to save hear this gospel
which isth$ power if God unto salva

NEWTON ON
STAND IN
' DEFENSE
Former Cashier cf First State Bank Tells
Why He Did Not Forward Money to
Secure Title to Bentley Land
Admitting that he had transferred
two items from the bank to his person-J
al account W. A. Newton, former cash
ior of the First State bank of Hush
Springs, who is on trial on the charge
of embezzlement, on the stand today
explained that these transactions were
made because of the season in which
they occurred being a period when
banks were being called on heavily
fpr loans and he did not want tne mon
ey to go out. t.
Newton took the stand yesterday af
ternoon after the defense had rested
and undertook to expLIn the Bentley
item of $1054.11, saying he did not
transmit that sum to the Indian agen
cy and secur? the patent on the lands
involved, first for the reason that it
was the borrowing time of the year
and that the bank needed the money;
second, for the reason that if the pat
ent had been secured on the land the
land would have become Immediately
detachable. He admitted that he had
transferred this sum to his own pe
sonal account in trust to pay for this
land but that subsequently he had
checked it out. He claimed to have
had no knowledg" as to the books
showing his account . to bo credited
with the $2500 item of 'date Of March
15, 1915, or that on the same date the
interstate National bank of 'Kansas
City was debited or charged with a
similar amount. He had checked on
his personal account, he said, to the
extent of $1000 on May 3, 1915, which
would have overdrawn his personal
account had it not been for the $1054.11
and $20 Hems. He admitted that
the account would have been over
drawn $2900 on that date had it not
been credited with such items.
Newton claimed not to have heard
about the credit of the $2500 item to
his personal account until July, 1915.
He admitted that his account was
overdrawn three cents on August 1.
Mr. Newton was on the stand a
large part of. the day in cross exami
