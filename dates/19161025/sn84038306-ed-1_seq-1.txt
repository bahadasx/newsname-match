WOODROW WILSON
President of the United States
"HE HAS KEPT US OUT OF WAR"
This is the face of a man strong, courageous,
patient and kindly, a man—
Always alert to the aspirations of his fellow*
man and sympathetic toward their fulfillment
Never complacent toward the encroachments
of privilege nor tolerant of social wrong
Atwaya seeking t©
labor and better the state of the toiler
Never lending an ear to the sophistry of ex
ploitation or the blandishments of expediency
Always patient to hear and weigh, to ap
praise and analyze, and passionate to find the
way of right
Never premature in purpose nor prejudiced
in judgment, and never headlong in decision
