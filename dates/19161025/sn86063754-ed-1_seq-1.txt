Storm and Earthquake Come
Together
She South was swept by a
storm and was rocked by an
earthquake Wednesday. A hurricane
drove across the Middle
Gulf States, taking a toll of two
lives and causing property and
marine losses, while earth tremors
drove frightened thousands
from homes and offices in Alabama
and Georgia, but did no
material damage.
Pensacola and Mobile were
the chief sufferers. One person
was killed at each place and
buildings were unroofed, telephone
and telegraph wires suf
fered damages; ships were sunk
u?i?i
uuu ucauucu.
At Pensacola the wind velocity
reached a maximum of 114
miles with 110 miles at Mobile,
but in neither city was the prop
ertv loss anything like as great
as that caused by the hurricane
of last July.
Mobile city itself suffered little
real damage, but shipping in
harbor did not fare sj well, two
small vessels being sunk and
four beached. Some damage to
train sheds and terminals also
resulted.
At Pensacola one small steamer
went down, another vessel is
missing; three fishing boats went
ashore and two larger vessels
were damaged when they came
together during the blow. Telephone
and telegraph wires
were prostrated for many hours,
the city being cut off entirely
from the outside world from
early morning until early night.
In southern Alabama timber
also was reported to have been !
badly damaged. but venorta war *L
that the citrus crops in that State
and western Florida had not suffered
greatly.
Torrential rains accompanied
the blow.
While two distinct earthquake
shocks were felt as far north as
Kentucky, and as far east as
Augusta, . Ga., they were of
greater intensity at Birmingham,
Ala., than elsewhere.
Montgomery, Atlanta, Augusta
and other cities also felt slight
tremors.?Thursday's State.
Aren't you ashamed, William,"
exclaimed the indignant minister,
"to hit a bov smaller than yourself?"
"Well, I don't know," said
William, who was a bit of a
philosopher. "I guess I'd rather
be ashamed to hit a smaller boy
than be sorrv I hit a bigger one."

21 Drowned A? Steamer Goes
Down in Lake Erie
Cleveland, O., Oct. 22.?
Twenty-one members of the <
crew of the steamer James B.
Colgate were drowned in Lake ;
Erie Friday night when the Col- (
gate bound from Buffalo to Fort .
William, Ont., with coal, went ,
down in a storm off Erie Penn .
sylvania. The tragedy became 1
known only todav when Cant. <
Walter Grashaw ol Cleveland,
sole survivor, was picked up by ,
a car ferry and taken to Conneaut,
Ohio, after being afloat 34 <
hours on a life raft. 1
Captain Grashaw, who was
master of the Colgate for onlv 1
twA urnnlrc *
>><?/ iiktno, uc^illllC UIICUUSCIUUS I 1
soon after being picked up but 1
was able to tell par! of the story 1
of the disaster.
Nineteen of the crew, he said, 1
were drowned when the big
whale back vesssel foundered J
and two others, Second Engineer
Harry Ossman of Cleveland
and an unnamed coal pass- p
er, were washed from the life s
raft after exposure and exhaus- f
tion had rendered them helpless. s
The Colgate went down the p
night of what has become 1
known in marine circles as
"Black Friday." Six men were }
lost when the steamer Filer p
sank in Lake Erie Friday on the u
same da> the steamer Marshal
F. Butters foundered but its v
crew of 13 was saved. li
Less than an hour after the
Filer sank the Colgate, by far v
th^ largest of the three lost ves v
tireless on the boat and noth ?
ing was learned ot the tragedy \
until Captain Grashavv was res a
cued, half dead from his long h
fight for life.
A terrific gale was blowing j ti
when the Colgate sprang a leak 0
early Fiiday night, Captain Gras- d
haw said and immediately it
was seen that the vessel was ft
doomed. "We got the life raft }
ready," he said, "just as the boat c
was so far down that tlw decks v
were awash." g

A party of strangers was visiting
at the college. It was in the
late autumn and the air was
crisp and cold. One of the
members of the party, a charming
young woman, was escorted
through the grounds bv a learned
but absent-minded professor.
Suddenly two members |of the
track team, dresssed for their
sport, passed.
"It's dreadfully cold," remarked
the young woman as she gazed
after the runners, "to be
without stockings."
The professor's mind, deep in
the contemplation of the fouith
dimension, was attracted by the
sound of the girl's voice.
"Then why," he asked absently,
"did yon leave them off?"
just bring your green backs and
treat your best girls properly.
