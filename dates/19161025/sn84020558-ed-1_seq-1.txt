Repuhllcan A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Oct. 24. Charges
that General Carranza is preparing to

fact t hilt Mrs. Carranza already has

Slates, accompanied hy the wife of her
liusliaiid's war minister and chief sup

Information to this effect is reaching
officials here from various reliable
sources. So far nothing tanKible tend

through official channels. It is known,
however, that many officials here be

a political blunder at least if he is not
i'i fact preparing for flight, by permit
ting Ins family to leave Mexico just at

tain 'op be construed by his followers as
a confession of weakness.
The purpose of the visit of Mrs. Car

at the Mexican embassy, is for a tcur
f the I" lined States. Word of the ;vr
rival at the border also of Mrs. Jacinto
Trevino, wife of the military comman

received tonight. It was pointed out.
however, that Trevino has been among
arranza s staunchest 'supporters and
that if the first chief believed his hold
on the political situation was weaken
ing. Trevino very probably would be
warned, m order that he might also

The state department had not re

l.owt-ver, said that the first chief would
go M that place in connection with the
meeting of the constitutionalist con

obtainable here for Carranza's depar

agents here claim to have received ad

Ozuna's Carranza column at Polomas,
IS miles west of Chihuahua City last
Friday. The confirmation is said to
have come from refugees reaching the
border from Chihuahua City, who
claim that Villa captured General
Ozuna's eleven troops and supply trains,
carrying ammunition, arms, machine
guns and supplies.
The refugees who brought this re

with survivors of Ozuna's column, who
said Villa led the Carranza troops into
a trap at Palomas, then attacked from
the front, flank and rear and cut the
railroad line behind the trains. The

taken prisoner.

CHICAGO, i let. Z4. Argentine corn
Is being shipped to Peoria, 111., the cen
ter of the cornbell of the I'nited
States. This corn, consigned to the
Miller Grain company, is the advance
shipment of a vast invasion of Argen
tine com products which will be sold
in the I'nited States in competition
with American corn.
The invasion of Argentine corn is
made possible because of the fait that
under the I'nderwimcl tariff law the
duty on corn has been removed, mak
ing unrestricted competition possible.
This dumping of Argentine corn
upon the I eona market has had a
startling and dramatic effect and is
calling attention to the competition
which the middle west farmer will
have to meet from the South American
republic. It Is understood that nearly
a million bushels of tArgentine corn has
already been used in glucose. The
fact that corn from the Argentine Is
being shipped into the I'nited States at
this time is the more remarkable be
cause of the absence of shipping fa
cilities and the almost prohibitive
ocean freight rates required for its
transportation.
Practically all the shipping of the
country is being utilized for the trans
portation of commerce between the
American and the belligerent nations
of Knrope. The freight rates are so
high that ships have been known to
pay for themselves in one vovage. In
pite of these excessive freight rates.
Argentine corn can be placed upon the
American market at a price less than
that paid for American corn for the
reason It has an advantage over
American corn because it possesses a
lack of moisture of from S to 10 cenrs
per bushel over American corn values.
Dealers in the Argentine product are
keenly interested in knowing whether
or not corn will be continued on tne
free list.
It is anticipated (hat if it remains
on the Tree list many millions or
bushels of Argentine corn will.be used
not only in Peoria, but elsewhere, and

HARD ATTACK AT

Hanly Launches New Attack
On Presidential Candidate
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
B1NGHAMTON, N. Y., Oct. 24.
Receipt of a copy of a letter Charlfs E.
Hughes' secretary recently sent to the
Michigan dry federation saying that
Mr. Hughes probably would make no
declaration of his stand on the liquor
question during the campaign, caused
J. Frank Hanly, the prohibitionist
presidential candidate here tonight to
launch a fresh attack on the republi
can nominee.
"Hughes said the other day," Hanly
declared, "that the country needed as
never before, an Abraham Lincoln, and
left the intimation that it might find
a Lincoln in himself, forgetful of the
OF WILSON
THREE SPEECHES
El
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
DENVER, Colo., Oct. 24. Pleas for
universal military training- and crit
icism of President Wilson for "de
bauchery of the civil service," char
acterized the address here tonight by
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, the prin
cipal one of a trio of speeches made in
the course of his one day stay in Den
ver. Colonel Roosevelt urged that
compulsory training would redound to
the benefit of the nation by increasing
democracy, devolping American youth '
physically and mentally, and aiding
the country's social and industrial de
velopment. His criticism of President
Wilson included a declaration that the
executive had "unchanged offices for
political support."
Colonel Roosevelt advocated repeal
of the Hay military bill and the restor
ation of the militia to its former status.
He cited Switzerland's development as
an instance of what compulsory mili
tary training would do in developing a.
country "physically, mentally and mor
ally." The colonel divided his afternon
speech, which primarily was to the
women of the state, between an ap
peal to them to vote for Hughes and
a sharp criticism of the administra
tion's foreign and Mexican policies.
He decalred the prosecuition of an
amendment to the consitution of the
T. nited States, enfranchising women,

I goal for the suffragists now and as
! serted that Mr. Hughes would main-
tain his announced stand in favor of
i this amendment.
The colonel participated in three
parades through the business district,

I this afternon, and a "red fire demon-
stration" tonight. Late this afternoon
: he spoke briefly to the members of
i tne "Hughes v omen s special cam-
paign party, which arrived late today.
j The colonel told the crowd that if
he had been president, and had sent
President Wilson's "strict account
ability" message to Germany, "there
would have been no more ships sunk
unless there was a fight afterward.
The Lusitania was sunk, with its 1.3s4
deaths as a consequence, because
other nations believed we'd been swept
out of war. If I had been president
then, I'd have seized every interned
German ship and then I'd have said
to Germany, 'now we'll see, not about
what you are going to give us as com
pensation for this, but what we are
going to give you.'

it is folly to say that we shall never be

two years show that as the world now
is, such an assumption by any nation
is not only folly, but criminal folly.
Washington, who was the very oppos

that this country could not expect al

people. At this moment we are not

the challenge of invisible government,
called a million men to his side, put
muskets in their hands, and bade them
shoot it to death.
"Where Lincoln stood and fought,
Mr. Hughes bows in dumb and silent
acquiescence."
Mr. Hughes' secretary wrote in re

these circumstances, these reports are

that he is not likely to make any dec
