"Soft Drinks"
Merchants
Must Have License. After
November 1st.
The Prohibition Act, which
Koob into effect November 1st,
contains a provision requiring
all sellers and dispensers of soft
drinks to obtain a license from
the circuit conn in order to ex?
ercise this privilege, and im?
posing heavy penalties for sell?
ing such drinks without having
first obtained this license. A
great many citizens of thecouu
try, through ignorance of this
law, are very likely to be caus?
ed inconvionco if they fail to
take out licenses, and we pub?
lish below a copy of the sec?
tions of the Prohibition Act
covering the "soft drink" pro?
vision.

CONCERNING THE HAR?
LAN-BRISTOL HIGH?
WAY.
Bristol. Oct. 10, 101G.
Mr. Chan Henry Davis, Pres.,
Nat ionallligh ways Association
South Yarmouth, Mass.
I)i>ar Sir:
In reply to your favor of tlio
Ith, in regard to Highway from
Bristol to Harlan, Ky. t have
to inform you that, tho Bristol
Lexington Highway, now call?
ed Bonne Way, passen within a
few miles of Harlan County, as
you will Bee from the unclosed
copy of Bristol Highway Map.
An easy connection may ho
made at Ben Hur, in Lee Coun
ly, Corinth on tho U. S. Geolog?
ical Map, across Cumboriand
Mountain and down Lour
Branch and Martin's Fork to
Harlan.
1 have assured Mr. Coutts
that Lee County, Virginia will
build the short section to tho
top of Cumberland Mountain,as
soon as Harlan County provides
for and builds to the Leo lino.
The construction of Boono
Way is already provided for or
assured. From Ben Hur to the
top of Powell Mountain, he
tween Stickly ville and Duffield,
about 22 miles, the road is grad?
ed, and about 0 miles macada?
mized, and the funds provided
with which to macadamize the
other 13 miles and the Convict
('amp, under State Supervision,
is now constructing this 111
miles.
Front the top of Powell Moun?
tain to DuHield'; l miles, the
road lias just been graded,large?
ly by private subscription. Ah
$SU,00U bond issuo was voted
last Spring with which to grude
the road from DufHeld to the
Clinch River at Speers Ferry
(as well its other roads), but
there was some illegality in the
election, and another election
will have to be held, but the
bond issue will carry again.
From Clinch River, at Speers
Ferry, via Gate City, the road
is graded to Holsten River,
abouti!| miles, except half a
niile at Clinch River, and funds
are in hand with which to
macadamize this 13 miles, and
convicts ate at work on it now.
Then there is about 1 miles of
old dirt and gravel road lo
Blooniiugdale, Tenn., a graded
roatl to Arcadia, and a macad?
am road to Bristol via Blounl
ville.
However, Boono Way east of
Moccaeion (lap follows a more
direct route lo Bristol, which is
all graded but I miles, and
bonds were voted to grade this
I miles, but held illegal and
will be voted again. With the
use of some Federal Aid, wo ex?
pect to macadamize this road
the entire distance in two or
three years.
In reply to letters from Mr.
Contts, I have twice requested
him to give me information as
to the present and future plans
or prospects for Harlan County
making the connected suggest?
ed, but have had no informa?
tion on tlit: subject.
As you will see from the en?
closed map, and from the facts
herein set out, there is no trou?
ble about a roail to Bristol from
Harlan, so far as the Virginia
end is concerned,and it is simp?
ly up to Harlan County to wake
up anil build a road out to
Boono Way at Ben Hur, or
some point in this locality.
Prom the map of Harlan
County, it would appear thut
no serious trouble should be
encountered in arousing inter
est in this project in Harlan
County.
I thank you for the map and
pamphlets.
With best wishes for the
cause of Good Roads Every?
where
Yours very truly,
Henry Roberts, Pres.
(A better route for the Bris?
tol to Harlan road woulti be by
tho way of Big Stono Gap and
Keokee, where, we understand.,
a gootl grade can be secured
across tho mountain. From
Keokeo to the Lee County line,
about five miles from Duflield.j
where it connects with the Bris?
tol to Lexington highway,there
is a good road, the larger por?
tion of which is macadamized.
This is tho most feasablo route
to Harlan.?Ed.Y

!May Quarantine
Maryland Also.
State Board of Health Alarm?
ed at Situation in Balti?
more, Where Paraly?
sis is Not Yet
Declining.
Richmond, Vn., Oct. 21.?
Unless infantile paralysis de?
clines in Maryland very soon,
tho Stale Hourd of Health is
apprehensive that that State
will have to be included in the
urea against which Virginia
has established partial quaran?
tine.
Health Committee Williams
is in daily communication with
tho health authorities of Mary
lend, is receiving regulnr re
ports of now cases and is hop?
ing that tho situation in that
Slate will improve. In case it
does, drastic action may not be
necessary and the present quar?
antine may bo raised at uo dis?
tant date.
Discussing the general out?
look today, Dr. Williams made
the following statement: "The
original epidemic in New York
appears to havn practically run
its course but some of tho epi?
demics that probably had their
origin in Now York are still
active. Wo have watched these
carefully anil havo modified the
quarantine as our experience
justified, but wo do not feel
that all dnnger is past by any
menus. Tho most hopeful
aspect of tho situation is that
the disease seems to abate or at
least to lose somo of its epidem?
ic form when cold weather
comes on. This may moroly
mean that troublo is postponed
until next summer, in which
case immediate action will be
necessary.
"Tho United States Public
Health Service recently pub
lished the returns for infantile
paralysis during .September in
all tho States. Virginia had
fewer cases by far than any
other State on the Atlantic sea?
board, with tho possible excep?
tion of North Carolina, which
did not file a report. Inasmuch
as Virginia has tho most strin?
gent quarantine of any of those
States, it is reasonable to sup?
pose that quarantine has been
responsible for ut least a part
of our relative immunity. It is
tho one weapon wo havo em?
ployed that some other states
havo neglected and it can hard?
ly bo a coincidence that our
morbidity was so low. The
hourd cannot afford not to read
its warning from this situation
uud would be recreant in its
duty if it took chances.
"Tho board will dislike hav?
ing to quarantine against Mary?
land, but if the situation in
Maryland does not improve, wo
must take those procuutions
which our experionoo leads us
to believe havo protected us
from the disease as it has ap?
peared in other States."
