SKETCHES.
J. Cager Yates.
Thirty-seven years ago Mr. J. Cager
Yates, a native of Adair county, blew
into Louisville and accepted a position
to travel for the well known hat
house, Swann Abraham & Co. His
samples were soon ready, and without
experience as drummer, he started.
He had the advantage of knowing
every retail merchant from Louisville
to Burkesville, and he had no misgiv
ings as to his ability to sell goods but
on his first trip he was a little too
clever with his samples and when he
reached Burkesville he discovered that
he had given away, to friends along
the route, all his sample hats. Full of
energy and nerve, he was not dismay
ed, ne ordered a fresti supply of sam
pies, and from that time for many
years he was constantly on the road.
In fact, he became one of Swann Abra
ham & Co's. most valuable men, and
when he quit the house to engage in
other business, it was with reluctance
that his firm parted from htm.
Mr. Yates haS at all times been a
busy and very reliable gentleman, and
for some years has been engaged in the
manufacture of overalls, and has es
tabl ished an i mmense business through
out the State He was never selfish,
ever ready to lend a helping hand in
cases of distress or when public im
provements were needed. When he
was quite a young man, living on his
father's farm at Gradyviile, a tramp
came along one cold day, and he was
coatless. Jim Cager was wearing a
good one and had others at home. He
could not stand to see the poor man
suffer, and removing his coat he hand
ed it to the tramp, saying: "Take this,
my friend, you need it worse than I do".
The wayfarer left rejoicing, and Mr.
Yates went to his father's residence
and donned another coat
Mr. Yates is well-known to every
body in this part of Kentucky and
every body knows that he has been a
successful business man. I could write
how successfully he used the tuning
fork in his earlier days, but it is un
necessary, as every body knows he is
musical and always on time.
Bargains.
For 30 days I will sell Men and
Boy's Clothing at cost for cash,
except Overalls.

Russell County Advancing.
For a great many years in the past
Russell county was known as a brady
county, a great deal of the stuff being
manufacutured annually, but a. very
perceptible change has been made, and
to-day there is not a dryer county in
the State. The writer was in, James
town the first two days of the term of
circuit court, now in progress. The
first day was cold and rainy, very dis
agreeable. A very large number of
the natives were in attendance, and'
we were constantly mingling with the
crowd. During the entire day we did
not see but one man under the influ
ence of liquor, and he does :not reside
in Russell county. This speaks
volumes for the good people, who years
ago were greatly annoyed by parties
who were almost constantly using too
much brandy. We spoke to a gentle
man about the change in conditions,
and he said: "The lid is on tight in
this county, that if a man was brought
before court, charged with making or
selling, by the time he gob through
paying fines that woula be heaped
upon him, he would be an" old man,
granting that he started young". No
county could have a more enviable
reputation than the one .who is deter
mined to drive whisky from its bor
ders. One gentleman said to us: "that
some times spirits were shipped in, tc
be used for other than medical pur
poses, and we are going to put a stop
to that procedure".
Jamestown is steadily improving, a
number of elegant homes having been
built in recent months. Also the new
Methodist Church building is about
completed, and the old Christian
church is being remodeled. The busi
ness of the town was fairly good during
the first week of court, and the farm
ers with whom we talked were rejoic
ing over their bountiful crops.
Good Farm for Sale.
The farm owned by S. A. Epperson,
deceased, situated 8 miles south-east
of Columbia, on Russell creek, contain
ing 127 acres, on which is a new, two
story, 8-room building and a large
barn, also a lot of corn and hay,
will be sold at public outcry at
the residence on said farm, on Satur
day, Oct. 28, at 1 o'clock, p. m., to the
highest and best bidder on a credit of
six months.

Wheat was al30 fine. It certainly is
