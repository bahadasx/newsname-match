Will Not Accept Money From

Deadlock Revived
KALAKAUA AVENUE TRACK
LAYING IS NOT SETTLED
Deadlock is Renewed When
Action of Board is Told By
Counsel for Company
That the Itapld Transit will not ac
cept the $3000, raised by public sub
scription, from Charles It. Forbes, as
from private citizens, but the money
'. must come from the board of super
" visors, a public body cooperating with
the street car company for the bene--fit
of the public, was declared today
by A. L. Castle, of counsel for the
" company. '
Castle continued that at the meeting
. held Tuesday noon Forbes was in
formed that the money must come
from the board and a vote by the di
rectors agreeing was" taken at the
time. The Rapid Transit is not a
charitable Institution," he said, "and
is not accepting donation from private
individuals'
This stand taken by the Rapid
Transit -again leaves the situation in
a deadlock and it is now up to the
supervisors to find some other means
of giving the money. As it stands, it
is impossible for. the board to take
the money from Forbes as on its ac
ceptance it becomes county ' money,
but cannot then give it to the Rapid
- .Transit, and the Rapid Transit has
declared Its intention of standing pat
on the proposition of. cooperation be
tween the street car company and the
board in paying for the excess cost of
fi temporary track. ;- '
. ..- -There was. however, some light shed
today when it was announced that the
rails -would probably be, here by the
middle of next August and be laid six
weeks later, "it seems to be the im
pression that the rails will not be
lierc. for 18 months, or two years,"
Castle said, "but this is not so, as they
vero ordered . for. June delivery and
will bo here six weeks later. This will
mean that the temporary track, if it
is laid, will only be in three or four
months.
At' a meeting held Tuesday after
noon between Forbes, superintendent
. of public works, and members of the
-.-' board of supervisors,, the former in
formed the board that his power
to order the Rapid Transit company to
Telocate its tracks was supreme but
that no one could make them lay tem
porary tracks. "I went out and have
raised 12000 by subscription," Forbes
'continued, "in order to overcome any
legal difficulties and which I now of
fer to you. The Rapid Transit is will
ing to- put up $5000.. Now, gentlemen,
are you. willing to accept the money?"
Under the law, however, the board
was unable to accept the money' and
it was finally agreed, after -considerable
argument in which hard words,
were .called, .particularly between
Arnold and Larsen, that Forbes, as fu
1 erintendent of public works, should
- order the Rapid Transit to relocate
r its tracks" and then as a private citi
zen, in which capacity he raised the
money, offer the company the $3000.
According to Carden, deputy city at
torney, if the 'board accepted the
money It would become county money
and thus come under the same cate-
gory as the original offer of $4000.
.. At first It appeared as if some of
the members of , the. board would not
agree to the Forbes plan, as it still
leaves in doubt the authorityof the
board and they felt it might set a bad
precedent.

Chihuahua City is rvearing capture, by
Gen. Villa's bandit army, according to
reports sent here today by Gen. Bell
at El Paso. ' "'.
He reports to Gen. Funston that
Gen. Trevino, the beleaguered com

GEN. FELIX DIAZ PLANS -OVERTHROW
OF CARRANZA
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct 25.
Menaced by the gathering forces of
Felix Diaz, nephew of the great dicta-
tor of Mexico, and by the growing ,
power of Pancho Villa, bandit leader
of bandits. Gen. Carranza, head of j
the de facto government of Mexico, Is
reiorted to he preparing to abandon
his country and flee for safety to-the
United States. I , "
His wife, accompanied by Irs. Ob
regon. the wife of Gen. Obregon, sec
retary of yar for the de facto govern
ment has already, crossed tho border
into the United States. .
. Such is the sensational , news
brought to this city in reports from
the southern republic, and given full
credence by the opponents of Carran
za and his administration. : These are
freely charging that Carranza, whose
personal power in Mexico is believed
to be rapidly dwindling until it now
is said to amount to kittle or nothing,
lias been laying his plans for fleeing
from the Mexican capital as soon as
possible. '
The Mexican embassy here denies
that the first chief of ttie republic
intends to leave, .and 'declares that
tho visit of the two women is but for
the puriHse of "making u tour of the
states."...
Despatches reachinff the border yes
terday declared that Diaz has entered
the city of Toluca, the capital of the
state of Mexico, and but a short dis
tance from the City of Mexico.
He is . said to have ' completed his
conquest cf the country about Toiuca.
and to be extending his. Tines in the
direction of the capital of the coun
try. ' lie -'whole. :of the southern part of
tlie republic is said to have rallied. to
his support, and to he lukewarm in
obeying the commands of ihe Carran

Tuesday.
"Although I believe the conspiracy
reports are exaggerated," he says,
"certainly he can call on us at any
time for all tH& polke protection he
requires. He can also resort to the
law for punishment of his alleged in

A. Lewis, Jr., Puts Financial
Questions Plain and Favors
Proposal for Nov. 7
GEN. R. K. EVANS GIVES
HIS "GOODBY" SPEECH
Retiring Commander of Depart
ment Says Aloha; Various -v
Features at Lunch
War and the municipal bond ;issue
were the two main subjects taken up
bv the Ad Club todav at its resruiar
luncheon at the Alexander Young
hotel. . ; . -
The subject of war was contained
in a letter from Paul Supei, general
superintendent of the 'Y. M, C. A,,' on
his experience in Canada and what
the people are doing there for the
war. A goodby speach by Gen. R. Ki
Evans, who is leaving' here, next
month, and a description of a trip
through Switzerland and Germany at
the beginning of the European war
by Gen. It. .Thayer, who is now touring
the Hawaiian Islands, were added
features, and the talk on bonds by 9.
Lewis, Jr., was the center of close
attention. L. A. Thurston alio spoke
briefly on the bond subject.
"1 came up here to say goodby,'
said Gen. Evans, "but ,J am coming
back; in fact, it will probably be next
summer. November 19 I shall be 64
years old and by law I must retire, but
I am glad to say that I am still in good
condition, for of ray-43 classmates at
West Point onlv seven remain alive.
I also wish particularly to thank L.
A. Thurston for the land which he has
opened to the soldiers at the volcano
foriUwillvetheuv great-pleasure
and thy are extremely anxious to go."
Mr. Thayer called his talk "A Trip
Through Hell,' and said that from
what he saw while making his way to
the-coast from Switzerland that war
should never be allowed and that mili
tarism is absolutely wrong.
Mr. Lewis cane out strongly for the
bond issue proposal, particularly for
waterworks and sewers.- ; Both he and
Mr. Thurston pointed out that the tax
increase plan cannot be effective un
til 1918, and Mr. Thurston indicated
that he favors the bond issue plan,
both of which jioints were appreciated
by the Ad Clubites.
Honolulu Must Progress
In opening his very pertinent talk,
Mr. Lewis pointed out1 that a large
amount of money must be expended ,
"to place Honolulu on a par witn ine
average American city." He asked if
Honolulu is willing to pay the price
and assumed that as a matter of pro
gressive public spirit, it is.
He pointed out the necessity of ex
pending funds in a comprehensive
manner and then went- into a discus
sion of the tax rate proposal.
Here he emphasized the inability
td get the revenues from increased
tax rates before 1918, and said that
it is agreed that Honolulu is behind
in public improvements now; and a
beginning on construction should be
made as soon as possible. He mint
ed" out that not only must tax rate in
creases wait upon legislative action
and thus be delayed until 1910, but
legislative action is required to re
lease the cash basis fund.
Here he said:
"The point I desire to make is that

Claimed Damage Wrought Be

ly Instituted Here
(Special '-to Star-Hiilletin by Mutual
Wireless. )
HILO. Oct. 23 George K. Marshall,
contractor in charge of the construc
ticn of the Hilo Breakwater, through
James W. Russell, his attorney, has
filed in the circuit court here an ac
tion for damages against the Ameri
can Surety Company of New York
and the Nations! Surety Company, al
leging that, because of suits brought
In Honolulu by . the American Surety
Company against Marshall, consider
able damage has been wrought be
cause of delays in the breakwater con
struction. :- The action for damages is directed
at n bond of ll'O.Ooo filed "n the cir
cuit court at Honolulu by the Ameri
can Surety Company at the time it
began its suit for injunction 'against
Marshall. The National Surety Com
pany was surety for the American
company for this bond.
Although the amount -of the dam
ages sought by Marshall is not stated
in the foregoing wireless message
from, the Star-Bulletin's correspondent
at Hilo, it is understood it is" equal
to the bond filed here by the Ameri
can Surety Company.
Action Does Net Surprise
The report , that Marshall has filed
the. suit is not nwatqylh law Xirm
of Frear, Prosser, Anderson ,5&"Tilarx;1
attorneys for . the American Surety
Company, Attorney M. F. Prosser, say
ing tody that the firm had been ad
vised that an action probably would
be taken.
"AH I have to say is that we will
be prepared to meet the case when
the pajers are served,"he adds. "We
have been infermed that Marshall
might bring the suit at any time."
On Tuesday Attorney Prosser was
informed that $23,000, representing a
claim -due Marshall from the United
States government for the breakwater
work, has been' impounded in Wash
ington, D. C, as the result of a sep
arate action brought there by the
American Suraty Company. He was
further informcJ that the defendant,
in this case has been "given until No
vember. 13 to tile his answer.
The American Surety Company, in
a suit tecently filed in circuit court,
alleges that Marshall is in debt to
it in tte sum of moro than $113,000.
It has aiso hrcught an injunction
against .Marshal: to restrain him from
receiving any "claims due him" from
the government for breakwater con
structir;!. Mari'iall won a point on Tuesday
when Circuit Judge Ashfard dissolved
the temporary injunction, discharged
Georgo S. Cnrry as receiver, and dis
solved the order of attachment sought
by the surety company. He also de
nied the plaintiff an interlocutory ap
peal to his oral decisions.
The surety company, however, to
day filed in circuit court notices of
appeal to all of the decisions handed
down by Judge Ashfoid on Tuesday.
