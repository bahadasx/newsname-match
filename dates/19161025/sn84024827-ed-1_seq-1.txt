island told of comparative quiet
throughout the republic, where thr
A-rerican marine forces are busy or
ganizing the native constabulary that
is to police the country under the di
rection of American officers.
Captain Wm. W. Low was sent to
Santo Domingo with his company

(By Review Leased Wire.)
MELBOURNE, Sept 18. (Correspon

commonwealth now is in the throes
of a campaign for and against compul
sory military service which was
brought on a few weeks ago by the
decision of the Hughes government

The enlistment situation at this
time shows that 140.000 reinforce

additional reinforcements needed up
to July 1 next year, are 100.000 and

(: Review Leased Wire) I
SYRACUSE, Oct 24. With the ap
proach of the campaign's end, the Re
publicans have failed to "find a flaw
in Woodrow Wilson's armor," de
clared Franklin K. Lane, secretary of
the interior, in an iddress here to
night When Charles Evans Hughes
was nominated, he said, he "felt a bit
nervous as to the outcome of the
electon, because he felt that if there
had been any great mistakes by the
administration, Mr. Hughes would
reveal them.
What Plan It G. O. P.'a
"He was the Republican's
strongest man and he has failed,"
the secretary said. "The great
est men that the Republican par
ty has drawn to it not only Mr.
Hughes,; but Mr. Taft and Mr.
Roosevelt, and your own state
leader, Mr. Root have been chal
lenged by circumstances to prove
their right to the title of states

pi'ograni, what pol.cy have they
presented to the American peo

cal, ' more American than that
which has been - pursuer by Mr.
Wilson. They have done their
best and they failed, not because
they were without ability or states
manship or without an intense de
sire to serve their country; they,
have failed because, with all
their genius, they could do no
belter than that plain uuassum-,
ing great man who four years
ago was in derision railed a school
master, but who has now risen to
be recognized as of the master
minds of the world.'
Mr. Lane said he did not question
the right of the Republican party to
"command a justice from the supreme
bench" and put him at the public
service, making him president of the
United States, if in a time 'of national
crisis it was necessary, if he alone
could save the country."
The Republicans talk much of Ameri
canism, he went on, but "this cam
paign has shown the Republican lead
ers do not understand America."
Speaking of President Wilson's pa
tience in his foreign policy, he said:
Wilson Has the Nerve.

Voters Divided
Since the prime minister came out
flatly for compulsory service, events
have been rapid and dramatic. The

Henry Ford, the automobile nianufac

with President Wilson today that a?
the result of an "inspiring talk" he
had with the President two weeks ago
he had established the women workers
in his plants upon the same pay basis
as the men.
Mr. Ford authorized the following
statement:
"I had the pleasure to inform Presi
dent Wilson this afternoon that I had
established the women wtorkers of my
plant at Detroit and in the branch
factories in other cities upon a pay
equality with the men workers. I
took this step, following my confer
ence with the President more than
two weeks ago and 1 did so because
of the inspiring talk I had with Mr.
Wilson on the forward movement
among womenklnd. This principle is
now in operation and I look forward
with complete confidence to its vindi
cation." Mr. Ford came here late today to
show the President advertisements
supporting the Wilson administration
which he plans to have published prior
to the election.
When he stepped of the train and
was asked why he came to Shadow

"To get on the Wilson band wagon."

WASHINGTON, Oct. 24. Charges that General Car
ranza is preparing to leave Mexico are being freely made by
his political opponents in Mexico City. They are based upon
his decision to leave his capital for Queretaro, and the fact that
Mrs. Carranza already has crossed the border into the United
States, accompanied by the wife of her husband's war minister
and chief supporter, General Obregon.
Information to this effect is reaching officials here from
various reliable sources. So far nothing tangible tending to
support the story has come through official channels. It is
known, however, that many of those here believe General
Carranza has committed a political blunder at least if he is not
in fact preparing for flight, by permitting his family to leave
Mexico just at this time. The trip, they say, was certain to
be construed by his followers as a confession of weakness.
