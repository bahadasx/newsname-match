SWINE SECTION MERI.
TORIOUS
Although the Fair was Late in Gotting I
rganised, the Attendance Was Large
and the Exhibits of High Order.
Plans Already In Making for Next
Year.
Darriag a shower of rain at the noon
hour Friday, the annual county fair
was a great success in nearly every
particular. The weather man, who had
assumed a threatening air for several
days, finally gave vent to his feelings
near the middle of the exhibition day
and drenched a large number who had
stayed on the grounds during the meal
hour. Although many were driven
away, the crowd that reassembled in
the afternoon to witness the riding and
driving contests was equally as large
as the morning's crowd and all wete
good humor.
The number and quality of the ex
hibits in the various departments this
year attested to the advances being
made In agriculture in this county. In
the food crop, swine and horse depart
ments the exhibits this year were bet-I
ter than ever before. The exhibit of
Youngs school, in the food crop de
Jpartmnent, and that of Mr. J. i.' Powers,
showed a wide variety of gardlen pro
ducts. The displays in the swine de
partment of Messrs W. P. Smith, H. D.
Stewart, T. M. Shaw and D. E. Todd
were especially noteworthy. The swine
exhibit was several times as large as
any ever shown before at the local
fairs.
The arena, always a strong card,
cis 10lo.fipJo9 -. ... BM N
brought out its usual fine display of
home grown horses and mules.
Perhaps the largest individual crop
and truck exhibit was made by John
I, Power, Whose booth contained 571
varieties, by actual count, of the pro- j
ducts he has grown on his farm this
year. He and his daughter and sister
also hAd 40Oexhibits of canned pro
ducts on display in the ladies' depart
ment on the grounds. In this last
named booth, under the management
of a committee of ladies, was present- I
ed a wide range of home made pro
ducts by thge farm wives and handi
work- by various contributors from the -
oity and the county.
Young's school, located in Young's
township, had a very attractively ar- l
ranged booth in charge of Miss Genie
Aiken, principal, and her assistants,
Misses Corinne Aiken and Mabel -
Moore. Products from the school
house garde were shown, and there
was a most creditable exhibition of
art, needlework and domestic science!
culture.
Many othier schools, it was under
siood, exp~ected to participate in the
lair exhibition, but the threatening
weather conditions, it was explained, r
muade the venture impractioable.
The Clinton brass band furnished
music for the day, and despite a
brisk shower of rain diaring .the early
afternoon, the occasion was immense
ly enjoyed and altogethey was the
success the managers and all others T
interested endeavored to make thet

laced her frail form on a bed of

I10H SCHOOL TEAMS
FIGHT TO A DRAW
Anderson and Laurens Lads Unable to
Score on Each other at County Fair
Friday Afternoon.
Anderson High School and laurens
High School fought to a draw in the
gridiron contest at the fair grounds
Friday afternoon, the four quarters
being completed without either team
being able to put the pigskin behind
the goal posts. The two teams played
about evenly throughout the match,
though the Laurens boys to be pena:
Ized on several occasions for off-side
plays. The Anderson team was a
husky set of youngsters and appeared
to have an edge on the Laurens boys
in weight. The nearest that either side
came to scoring was just before the
end of the second quarter, when Lau
rents had the ball a few yards from the
Anderson goal. On the fourth down
the Laurens boys lost the ball on an
unsuccessful forward pass.
Spectacular playing was some what
at a premium ,both teams pinning
their hopes largely on straight line
backing. Earle Langston was the
mainstay of the Laurens aggregation
In this department of the game while
Green did the plunging for the "My
yown" boys. J. L. Ialngston and the
two Fuller boys did effective work in
the line. For the Anderson boys .\ar
in and Dunford were strong support
is. The members of both teams, with
)ut exception, played consistently.
Laurens was weak in putning.
Trho game was free from objection
ible features. The Anderson lads, like
the local boys, played a clean game
.hroughout the afternoon and made a
good impression on the speteators.

W. '. P1OLLO.1(K WILL MAKE
RACE FOR U. S. SENATE
Announced Monday Night that Ile
Would be a Candidate for Office in
1918. "iamecock" Candidate.
Columbia, October 23.--W. P. Pol
lock, of Cheraw, tonight announced
that he would be a candidate for the,
United States senate In 1918, when the
state will again select one of her rep
resentatives in the "greatest delibera
tive body on earth." This is the first
definite announcement for the senate.
Senator Tillman, who now holds the
seat that will be filled at. the next
election, has issued no statement late
ly in regard to himself, so it is yet
somewhat problematical as to whether
or not he will be a candidate to suc
ceed himself. The senator has, in
years past, expressed a desire to "die
in harness," though more recently he
has intimated that because of his frail
health, he will retire from public life
at the expiration of his present term.
The announcement of Mr. Pollock
will create much Interest. lie was

Improving Very Rapidly.
The latest news received at this of
flee yesterday from Mr. J. A. P. Moore
who left last week to undergo an op
oration in Cleveland Ohio, was that
he was improving very rapidly. Dr.
C. P. Vincent, who accompanied Mr.
Moore to the hospital, returned to
this city Teusday morning and reports
that he saw the operation, which al
though was a very tedious one, Mr.
Moore stood it fine. The specialist
which operated on Mr. Moore, stated
that this was the 1,86-4th Goitre oper
ation which he has done. In a tele
gram received by relatives, from Mr.
J. S. Machen, who is with Mr. Moore,
it was stated that the physician
thought probably Mr. Moore could re
turn home within ten days or two
weeks.
Made "Big Haul".
Rural Policemen '. L. Owens and A.
I. Boyd made a "big haul" Saturday
night of those fellows who handle the
bones and cards by the fire light out
in the woods. They flushed two
"covies" of them; one in Waterloo
Township and the other just across the
litr in Dials Township. There were
1-1 caught on the Waterloo side and
10' on the Dials side. The raid was so
carefully planned, that everyone of
the indulgers were trapped. Police
man Owens came very near having to
shoot one of the negroes in order to
save his own life, as one of them, be
ing drunk, grabbed a shot gun and
was ready to shoot, when Mr. Owens
got the drop on him and prevented any
further difficulty,
Synall Fire Friday.
Friday afternoon about 3 o'clock,
the home of Mr, J. F. Harney, which
is located on College Place, caught
fire and a considerable amount of dam
age was done. The fire, when discov
ered, was burning in and above a
wardrobe which was in a corner of
one of the bedrooms. The fire alarm
was sent in and shortly after the truck
reached the scene, the fire was put out.
However the fire and smoke, together
with the water, caused considerable
damage to everything contained in this
room. No other part of the house was
damaged to any extent, No one was
present when the lire started. it was
s5tpposed to have started by rats and
was discovered by neighbors, who gave
the alarm.

Greenville, Oct. 22.-The insane asy
lum or the electric chair?
The sands in the Judicial hour glass,
sifting ,for four years, have reached
that point where one of these two
fates awaits Thurston U. Vaughn, of
Greenville, found guilty of a num
ber of crimes so hideous that even
men in conversation with men find
difficulty in grasping words that are
not too obscene and vulgar as a vehi
cle of expression.
Solicitor Proctor A. lionhamn, after
careful consideration of the Vaughn
case and after receiving opinion from
eminent physicians whom the state had
retained to examine into the con
demned man's mental condition, S'at
urday decided to let Vaughn remain in
the State Hospital for the Insane,
where he is confined. "The likelihood
of his returning to normal mental con
dition is quite remote," the solicitor
announced, "but if he should, he may
at any time be resentenced, and he
would have to suffer the death penalty,
unless clemency were granted by the
governor."
In making this iial and important
decision, Solicitor Itonham made
public, at their consent, the oi.inions
handed down by the physicians who
had Vaughn under examination in the
asylum since last March. H also
gave out a statement, settin. forth
the reasons for his action In the Iat
ter.
''hus another inportant chapter has
been recorded in the famous caso
which has been followed with the
keenest interest throughout, from his
first arrest, escape from the county

sentenceed to death, and appeals to the
ulpreme court of the state and of the
United States.
