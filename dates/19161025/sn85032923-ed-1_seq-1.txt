FIFTY-THIRD YEAR
ASSASSINATION FOUR
OF PREMIER
REGARDED AS
THE ACT OF
Killing the Result
Of Extreme Ideas
SLAYER'S VIEWS WERE SO
RADICAL THAT EVEN
SOCIALISTS WOULD NOT
ENDORSE THEM; PUBLIC
NOT ALARMED OVER
THE MURDER.
VIEXXA, Oct. 23. Dr. Friedcrich
Adler, the assassin of the Austrian
premier. Count Karl Stucrgkh, is be
ing held by the police awaiting trial.
He maintains his composure.
The population of Vienna is recov
ering from the shock of the assassin
ation. Throughout the empire Dr.
Adlcr's act is deplored and looked
upon as the deed of a fanatic.
Dr. Adler was once editor of a So
cialist paper but severed his connec
tion with the partyoiftTTfiTrie ago on
account of its attitude in supporting
the government's war policy.
The assassin is known as a very
morose man. He has one brother in
an insane asylum, as well as a sister.
He has been troubled for a long time i
with heart disease and has been in :
poor health for many years, so that, !
although he is only 37 years old, he '
gives the impression of being an aged
man. He has two children. His wife
is an invalid.
After studying chemistry and work
ing for several years as a chemist,
Adler went to Switzerland. He re
turned to Austria shortly before the
war, imbued with extreme Marxian
theories, which he advanced in a peri
odical called Das Volk.
This paper ceased publication at the
outbreak of the war. j
Subsequently Dr. Adler founded !
Dcr Kampf, in which lie treated social I
problems in an able, scientific manner.
The assassination was political
since Dr. Adler was entirely unknown
to the premier. He recently desired
thf fnrialists tn take certain action

was pewed unfavorably by the party.
He then cut loose lrom tue socialists.

ing independently wealthy, he was
able to follow such a course.
Count Stucrgkh was little known to

premier, nc was oi quici aim rcur- i
ing disposition. !
His tenure of office brought him no
great chances, though some were ex
pected when he became head of the
government. Thus far it is unknown
who will succeed Count Stucrgkh, but
the impression is that neither the at
titude of the government nor the
course of the war will be influenced
by Adlcr's act.
Represented No Party.
Government circles here regard the
killing of Premier Stucrgkh as an act

It is pointed out that the time
which has elapsed since the murder
has shown that Adler, the assassin, I
stands alone. His act is disavowed j
by the Socialist party and press and
condemned by his father, Victor Ad- j

chamber of the rcichstrath. '

SEVEN BODIES OF CREW
OF THE MERIDA ARE
WASHED ASHORE; 23 ON
BOAT PERISH.
CLEVELAND, Oct. 23. Local
managers of the steamer Mcrida,
owned by the Valley Camp Shipping
Company of Midland, Ont., conceded
today that the ship was lost in Friday
night's gale on Lake Eric.
The admission came after seven
bodies of the crew had been picked
up in mid-lake by two other ships.
So far as is known not a man of
the crew of 23 survived the tragedy.
The loss of the Mcrida makes four
lake steamers which went to the bot
tom of Lake Erie in Friday's storm.
The total loss of life is 50.
The steamer Butters sank with no
loss of life, all thirteen of her crew
being saved.
The D. F. Filer went down with six
of her crew, only the captain sur
viving. The James D. Colgate's crew of 22,
with the single exception of the cap
tain, perished, while every man on the
Mcrida is believed lost.
Bodies Brought to Port.
TOLEDO, Oct. 23. Three bodies
of sailors, wearing life belts stamped i
Steamer Mcrida," were brought into
port early today on the freight steam- i
er V. B. Matthews, captain W. C. j
Cunningham, from Toronto. '
This is the first definite proof of the f
loss, during a gale last Friday, of the j
steamer Mcrida with a crew of about
20 men.

Crowd Goes 'Wild With
Enthusiasm Over Campbell
At The Roosevelt Meeting
Greatest Ovation To A fflan In Public Life In Arizona Is
Accorded Candidate For Governor In Phoenix Last
Saturday; 'They Are More Interested In You

One of the greatest tributes ever
paid to a man in Arizona was the
popular demonstration for Tom
Campbell at the Roosevelt meeting
held in Phoenix last Saturday.
Over 6,000 people had assembled to
hear the great ex-president speak in
behalf of Hughes, the Republican
candidate for president and red
blooded Americanism. He received
the homage due to a man of his posi
tion, but deeply beloved as Mr. Roose
velt is, the reception given him paled
into insignificance when the "man
with the hig sombrero," a few minutes
late, ascended the speaker's stand. At
the sight of him, the crowd, estimated
from 6,000 to 8,000 people, arose as
one man, waved flags and .cheered
lustily for the next governor of Ari -
zona. Colonel Roosevelt led him out ;
to the front of the speaker's stand J
and the enthusiasm broke bounds, it
being many minutes before the ap
plause and cheering died down.
After Colonel Roosevelt had con- J

Campbell made a hit with every

the best speaking voice of any man

Mr. Campbell assured the crowd
that it was a great privilege to speak
