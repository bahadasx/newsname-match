gained yesterday along a front four
miles long in the Verdun region, ac
cording to Paris. The gains in some
places extended nearly two miles in
side the former German lines. The
French reported 3,500 prisoners cap
tured, including the German com
mander of Fort Douaumont. '
Berlin admitted the French made
gains on this front.
Rain hindered military operations
cn the Somme front.
, Paris announced that Italian caval
ry from Southern Albania has formed
a junction with the entente forces in
Macedonia. This gave the Entente
Allies an unbroken front of 250 miles
from Avlona on the Adriatic, to the
mouth of the Struma river on the
Aegean. '
Berlin critics point to the capture
of Predal, reported yesterday, as
marking a Rumanian loss of natural
mountainous defehses on their Tran
sylvanian frontier. They declared it
put the Teutons almost in position to
Onove on to the Rumanian plains to
ward Bucharest. Berlin announced
pthe capture of Vulgan pass today. "
Bucharest announced the Ruman
ians near Predeal and Kimpelung had
fallen back a short distance.
In the Dobrud ja Berlin announced
the capture of Tchernavoda.
Petrograd said the Russo-Rumanian
forces have evacuated Tcherna
voda and a position at Lake Tachaul
near the Black Sea.;

The total Russian casualties since
June 1st, is announced as 1,797,521,
according to figures given out by a
semi-official news agency in Berlin.
The figures, are declared to have been
taken from the latest reports reports
of the Russian central identification
bureau at Kiev. s '
COUNTER ATTACKS FAILED
Paris, Oct. 25. German counter at-"
tacks north of Verdun in an effort to
capture the Haudromont quarries and
the Damloup battery won by the
French during yesterday's assault
were repulsed, said the war office.
SURPRISE ON BOTH SIDES
The Germans apparently were com
pletely surprised by the French at-
1 tack at Verdun, and failed to stop the
rush at any point. In three hours the
French captured ground the Germans
spent months gaining. The French
account of the battle declared the
German lines "burst." Later details
indicated the extent of the victory
was as much a surprise to the French
as to the Germans.

BETTER THAN BASEBALL
Frenchmen Practice Pitching in Order
to More Efficiently Aid in Their
, Country's Defense
(Associated Press)
Paris, Oct. 25 Throwing the gre
nade is becoming a popular form of
sport in Fran ce. A special chevron
has recently been designated to be
worn on -the arm of the best grenade
thrower in each company. Besides
the army, the sporting clubs have
taken up grenade throwing, and gre
nade matches now take the place of
throwing the hammer, the dicus, etc.
It is claimed that some of the sol
diers have thrown a grenade 253 feet,
but this is challenged by the sporting
experts on the ground that the throw
was not .made before a regular or
ganization and was a free-arm throw.
According to the regulations, a gre
nade cannot be thrown straight from
the shoulder, like a baseball, but is
given a swinging overhand throw,
much as a cricket ball is bowled.

TOMPKINS WONT RUN
A Star reporter this morning inter
viewed Mr.. D. W. Tompkins as to
whether he would stand for re-elec
tion as alderman in the first ward.
- Mr. Tompkins said he has served
his time, done the best he knew how,
drawn his emoluments, including &
fair share of criticism, and intended
to let some other fellow take his
place. He believed he had made good
with his friends, displeased some,
wasn't sorry he had served but would
be glad to give way to a successor.
He spoke well of Mr. Winer, who may
be a, candidate, said he hoped he
would run and be elected.
Mr. Tompkins has been a faithful
worker on the council, and while he
has doubtless made some mistakes he
has done a lot of strenuous and intel
ligent work. His friends are sorry
he has concluded not to serve longer.

HOW CATARRH IS CONTRACTED
Mothers are sometimes so thought
less as to neglect the cold3 which their
children contract. The inflammation
of the mucous membrane, at first
acute, becomes chronic and the child
has chronic catarrh, a disease that is
seldom cured and that may prove a
life's burden. Many persons who
have this Tothsome disease will re
member having -had frequent colds at
the time it was contracted. A little
forethought, a bottle of Chamberlain's
Cough , Remedy judiciously used, and
all this -trouble might have been avoid
ed. Obtainable everywhere. . .

$10,060,000 each for two ships by the

TAKING A LONG TRIP
On the A; C. L. northbound Strain
today was a little boy on his . way
from St. Petersburg to his home in
Mexico City. '
He did not fit the American idea of
a typical Mexican, for he had blue
eyes and fair skin. He was a very
self-possessed little fellow and spoke
good English, altho he was only eight
years old. His name could not be h
made out, but he said he was the son
of a captain in he Mexican army, and
had been in this country about a year.
This was not , his first trip alone,' as
he previously traveled from Cincin
nati to St. Petersburg by himself. 1
The attention of Capt. H. O. Mc-
Arthur,' district superintendent of
the A. C. L., who was on the train,
was attracted to the child and the
two soon made friends. The little
boy will go thru Laredo, where the
Florida soldiers are. Everybody was
being good ; to the kid," and perhaps
this time next week at least one Mex
ican family will believe the Gringoes
are not such bad folks after all.
