Counsel for Company
Two letters from Superintendent
Forbes, delivered shortly before 3
o'clock this - afternoon to : the super
visors and the. tf apld Transit. Com
pany are the latest developments in
.the Katakaua track situation.
In his letter to the transit company
he orders the relocation of its track on
ths much discussed thoroughfare In ac
'cordance witrt the official grades ap
proved by him and ths city and coun
ty engineers. The .letter states that
" It is ths superintendent's understand
ing that the -company has assigned
$5000 toward laying a temporary track,
and that It stands'reafly to oo tne ne
c Jiry construction work providing
.JMm9intrm 12noa tan be found

'sim will be paid by the Waterhouse
Trust Company on the completion of
.the temporary contract
In his letter Jo the supervisors he
states -that the way Is now cleared
for undertaking , the Improvement of
Kalakaua; and" states thar the com
pany Is ordered to relocate its tracks;
.also that the Waterhouse Trust Com
pany is on recorcTasfagreelng to' pay
to the ..Rapid Transit Company the
'.sum of $3030 to be deposited s soon
as collected. Neither of the - letters
"mentions the facf that" directors of
the street car company have refused"
to accept the money from private in
dividuals. N -l That the Rapid Transit will not ac
. -cept the3000, raised Jy public sub
scription; from Charles R. Forbes) as
- from private cltlrens, but the money
must come from the board of super-,
visors, a public body cooperating with
the street car company for the bene
fit of the public was declared today
' "by A. TU Castle, of counsel ,for the
company. . -.
; . Castle continued that at the meeting
held Tuesday noon Forbes was in
formed that the money must come
from the board and a vote by the di
rectors agreeing was taken at the
time. The Rapid Transit Is not .a
charitable institution," he said, "and
is not accepting jlonation- from private
Individuals.". -
This stand- taken by the Rapid
Transit again leaTes. the situation in
a deadlock and it is now up to the
supervisors to find some other means
of giving the money.- As it stands, tt
Is impossible for the board to take
- '. money from Forbes as on its ac:
. Jreptance it becomes county money,
but cannot then give it to the Rapid
-Transit, and the Rapid' Transit has
declared its Intention of standing pat
on tlie proposition of cooperation be

board In paying for the excess cost of
: a temporary track,
There was, however, some light shed
" today when it was announced'that the
rails would, probably be here by the
Jnlddle of next August and be laid six
weeks later. "It seems to be the im
pression 'that the rails will not be
here "for 18 months,, or tw.o years,"
. - Castle said, "but this is not so, as they
were ordered, for June delivery and
will be here six weeks later. This will
mean that the temporary track, -if it
- is laid, will only fce in three or four
months." . .- " '. '"- . l; ;
' At a meeting held Tuesday after
. nocn between Forbes, superintendent
of public works, -and members of the
hnard of supervisors, the former in
formed the board that his power
to order the Rapid Transit company to
-relocate Its tracks was: supreme but
that no one could make them lay tem
porary tracks. ' "I went out and have
raised $3000 by subscription," Forbes
iwitimipd. " in order to overcome any
legal difficulties and which I now of-

are you willing to accept the money?"
Under the law, however, the board
c iinfthi to a.poett the money and
it was finallv aereed. after consider-

(Arnold and Larsen. that Forbes, as f u
VeHntAndpnt of Dubllc works, should
order the Rapid Transit to relocate
its tracks and then as a private ciu
reiu in which .rapacity he raised the
money., offer the company the $3000.
According to Carden, deputy city at
torney, if the board accepted the
money It would become county money
and thus come under- the same cate
gory as the original offer of $4000.
-At first it appeared as If some of
the members of the board would not
agree to the Forbes plan, as it still
' leaves in doubt the authority of the
- board and they felt it might set a bad
. precedent. ' - ,

Features at Lunch
War and the municipal bond Issue
were the two main subjects taken up
by the Ad Club today at Its regular
luncheon at the Alexander. Young
hotel. . 1 ;'-..'--'. .
The subject of war was contained
in a letter from Paul Super, general
superintendent of the Y. M.' C. A., on
his experience in Canada and what
the people are doing tlfere for the
war, A goodby speach by Gen.! R, K.
Evans, who is leaving : here next
month, and a description of a trip
through Switzerland and Germany at
the beginning of the 'European war
by Geo. B. Thayer, who is now touring
the Hawaiian Islands, were added
features, and the talk on bonds by A.
Lewis, Jr., was the center of close
attention. L. A. Thurston also spoke
briefly on the bond subject
"I came up here " to say goodby,"
said Gen. Evans, "but I am coming
back; in fact, it will probably be next
summer. November 19 I shall be 64
years old and by law I-must retire, but
I am glad to say that I am still in good
condition, for of my 3 classmates at
West Point only seven remain alive.
I also wish particularly to! thank L.
A: Thurston for the land which "he has
opened to the soldiers at the volcano
for it will give them great pleasure
and thev are extremely anxious to go."
" Mr. Thayer called his taIkMA Trip
Through Hell.1 and said, that from
what he saw while uialcinghls way to
the coast from V Switzerland war
should never be allowed and that mili
tarism is absolutely wrong. ". "
Mr. Lewis came out strongly for the
bond Issue proposal, particularly for
waterworks and sewers." ; Both he and
Mr. Thurston pointed out that the tax
increase plan cannot be effective un
til 1918, and Mr. . Thurston Indicated
that he favors the bond issue plan,
both of which joints were appreciated
by' the. Ad Clubites. 4 " ' " T .-. .''
Honolulu Must Progress ;
" In opening his very pertinent talk,
Mr. Lewis pointed out that a large
amount of money must be expended
"to place Honolulu on a par' with the
average American city." He asked If
Honolulu is willing to pay the price
and assumed that as a matter of pro
gressive public spirit, it is. V
He pointed out the necessity of ex
pending funds ; in a comprehensive
manner and then went into a discus
sion of the tax rate proposal.
Here ho emphasized the inability
to get the revenues from increased
tax rates' before 1918,. and said that
it is agreed .that Honblulu is behlpd
In public Improvements7 how and a
heginnlng on construction should be
made as soon as possible. He point
ed out that not only must tax rate in
creases wait upon ; legislative action
ahd thus be delayed" until 1910, but
legislative action is required to re
