PARIS. Oct. 28. The French at
tack at Verdun apparently took the
Germans by surprise, who were un
able to stop the Impetuous rush. In
three hours the French recaptured
ground to lain which required
months of patient effort on the part
of the Germans, including such posi
tion a Douaumont fort and Thiau
mont work!),' which have been won
and lost repeatedly.
Details of the French victory show
that its extent is as much a surprise
to the French as It must have been
to the Germans. The Germans evi
dently believed that the French en
ergies were absorbed in the battle
of the Somme and made no prepara
tions to meet the Verdun thrust.
Everywhere the Germans gave way.
When Douaumont fort was taken the
German defenders, refusing to sur
render, were killed. The third col

WAR NEWS AT A GLANCE
llr AMoclitel Fmi,) I
Switching their offensive from the Somme region in Prance
possibly as a counter to the advance of the Teutons in the Dobrudja
region of Rumania the French have smashed" the German line north
and northeast of Verdun over a front of four and one-third miles,
penetrating it along its entire length in the center, gaining a
distance of nearly two miles.
Preceded by a violent bombardment, Buch as mtirked the great
attacks and counter attacks during the days when Verdun was the
focal point in world interest, the offensive was delivered apparently
from the eastern bank of the Mouse river, near Rras eastward to the
Damloup battery.
When night fell, the village and fort of Douaumont, in the
center, were in the hands of the French, while their left wing the
Frenchmen had pushed beyond Thiaumont, and captured the" llaud
romont quarry, and taken up positions along the Bras-Douaumont
road. On their right wing considerable progress also had been made
from Douaumont to Damloup. More than 3600 prisoners and
quantities of war material were captured by the French.
In the Dobrudja region ol Rumania, the Germans, Bulgarians
and Turks are giving no rest to the Russians and Rumanians, who
continue to retreat along the entire front from the Black sea to
the Danube river, although at some points theyiare vigorously
opposing the advance of the invaders. T
Tachova, on the river a short distance below Tchernavoda, and
Medjidie, on the railway between Tchernavoda and Constanza,
have fallen into the hands of the Teutonic allies? ; In the latter
regiou cavalry is pursuing the retreating Russo-Rumanian forces
well to the north of the railroad line. More than '6700 prisoners
have been taken by Field Marshal von Mackensen's forces.
