ONI' i.t the iiblcst, most lui'iil and
forceful discussions ol national
politics that has appeared during 'hie
presort campaign Ih from the irn f
a crimen of Tulsa, II. N. Gardner, who
has re. onliy located In this :iy. Prior
to coming to Oklahoma Mr. Gardner
was a prominent New York state
editor. His articles, which has at
tracted nation-wide attention, appear
ed in the current issue of The Out
look and was in reply to an article in
that publication by Theodore l'rlce In
dofenso of President Wilson ami his
administration. Hoing a practical
newspaper mnn, Mr. Gardner wastes
no words In dim ussing the situation,
and for sledge-hammer strength,
terseness and brevity as well as for
Its soundness ar.d logic it is one of
the hest things that has appeared din
ing the campaign.
Ho literally punctures the bogus
prosperity argument In support of
President Wilson and his administra
tion by pointing out the results of his
politics enacted Into luw before re
lief came from the unexpected but
temporary source, the F.urnppiin vnr.
lly perrr.isHion of The Outlook, The
World is privileged to reproduce the
Gardner article 111 full It is .is fol
lows: 'resident Wilson and his De-mo-rrtle
associates could ask for no bet
ter advocate than Theodore II. l'rlce,
whose extremely able article in The
Outlook of August 2,1 was an argu
ment In favor of the continuation of
the present administration from an
Industrial and financial standpoint
olone which could not be surpassed.
Mr. l'rlce presented statistics and
a carefully selected array of facts
which, to the ordinary mind not given
to analysis; seemed to make out an
Incontrovertible case to prove the
power of thp Democratic administra
tion to advance prosperity.
Like the aide debaters of all
parties, Mr. l'rlce. in carefully select
ing the facts which he wished to pre
sent, as carefully refrained from men
tioning even more important facts
and statistics which would have
proved the fallncy of his entire argu
ment, lie presented statistics from
the department of commerce and la
bor in which he compared the Indus
trial condition of the country in lttlti
to that of 191:2. and these seemed to
show that the country had waxed ex
tremely fat Industrially under the
Pemocratie administration, lie care
fully refrained, however, from pre
senting statistics for the years 1913,
1914 ami 191a, which would have
shown the terrible industrial lean
ness suffered by the I'nited States for

the nonpartisan election of nil judges und oklahomA should get In line with
this forward Spirit of the times. There Is nothing so disastrous to good
government as politics In our courts. The World has long helel the opinion
that judges should not be nominated In the manner other candidates for
office are selected. Kven the direct primary, although weak In many other
respects, falls to give the proled'on from politics and demagogucry that
should be secured in the selection of our Judges In fact we feel tha the
primary method falls to secure the best men for any office, but It has a
tendency especially towards the selection of the least qualified men for
Judges. The best lawyers are reluctant to enter Into a contest such as is
necessary to secure a Judicial nomination and have to be drafted In order to
get their names before the voters, tho masses of whom are, from their lack
of knowledge of the Intricacies of tho law, tho least qualified to Judge of
the qualifications for the Judiciary.
The World goes so far as to set up the belief that If the selection of
Judges could bo left to the state bur association we would see a marked
Improvement In the character of our Judges. If nominations wore left to
