"It is hardly necessary to say that if I am elected wo

he is doomed to disappointment." Extract from Cliarles

NUPTIAL MASS SOLEMNIZED
The marriage of Miss Margaret
Preston Draper, daughter of Mrs.
William F. Draper, and Prince An
drea Boncompagni, of Rome, was
solemnized at noon today in the
famous tapestried ballroom of the
Draper mansion, in K street.
The wedding ceremony, which
was marked by great solemnity
and beauty, was celebrated in ac
cordance with the full ritual of
the Roman Catholic Church, and
is remarkable in the social annals
of Washington; as it is one of the
few times a nupt'al mass has been
solemnized in the United States
outside of a Catholic Church.
The unusual privilege of having
mass said in a private house is one
of the favors bestowed by the
Church of Rome on Boncompagni
Ludovici family, which has given
two Pontiffs and numerous distin
guished prelates to the church.
