Shelby, Orleans County, March SI,
1915, was resentenced by tho Court of
Appeal to bo executed at Hlng Sing
Prl-von during thu week beginning
Dec. 11.
Heyond the flight quivering of the
lip 1 ami fliiHlied cheeks, Stlelow
manifested no emotion as Chief .Judge
Martlet t directed that tho Warden of
Sing Ming Prison execute tha death
sentenco Imposed by tho lowor court.
Stlclow, handcuffed to ono of tho
two guardti who nccompnnle.1 lilm
from Sing SltiK Prison, entered the
assembly chamber, tompijreirlly the
homo of Uio court, a niomWt or two
beforn the schhIoh wan convened.
After nitrlet Attorney Knicker

"mor. hud moved that tho court ret
til" dati for tho execution, the t'hlef
lildgu asked Stlclow If ho could k1,
any ronwin why tho court should not
proceed.
lllslng slowly to his feet, the pris
oner gazed at tho row of Judges In
their gowns of sombre black and then
said falterlngly and In n volco that
was barely nudlblo even to those
seated near him:
"I didn't do tills murder."
Then ho he.sltated for a moment as
his eyes ranged from ono end of the
bench to tho other. It was with dlf.
flculty that hn was able, to proreed.
A second later In faltering phrases
be said to the Judges:
"Tho ndmlsslotiH on which I was

"You had better do tho talking."
An Htlelow sank back Into tho

PLEADS WITH COURT
SWEARS TO THREAT
BY MRS. BEUTINGER
TO KILL HUSBAND
"Said She Would Finish Him
if He Didn't Leave Her
Alone," Says Witness.
TRIAL MOVES RAPIDLY.
Jury Obtained and Testimony
Begun in Hour Children
See Mother at Bar.
A startling hit of testimony was
brought out this afternoon at the trial
of Mrs. Margaret E. ncutlngcr before
Judfto Martin In Nowark for the mur
der of her husband. It Is tho conten-
I tlon of the defense that Mrs, Beutln
ger shot her husband In self. defense.
Eugene Oraaf, an employee In tho
Heutlnuer household, tcstlllod that
when he entered Mrs, Ueutlngcr's
j bedroom, Just aflor tho tragedy, Mrs.
! Unutlnger told him Mcutlngor had
j mado three visits to her that morn
ing, uraar atiiieu:
"Mrs. Beutingor informed me she
had told her husband she would
finish him If he did not let her
alone and that he replied, 'Go
ahead and do it.'"
The trial moved rapidly, tho tlrst
witness being called Just one hour
after the Judgo ascended tho bench
at 10 o'clock. Her white-gloved hnnds
folded In her lap, Mrs. Meutlnger
watched the proceeding much nioro
as a spectator than as a prlsonor
charged with murder.
Her children, threo llttlo girls and
two llttlo sons, wero seated behind
her In the space resorved for specta
tors, They bobbed their heads about
to peep between tho shoulders of
those In front.
Mis Meutlnger. a slender, dlmlnu
tl v woman, wits made to nppe.ir
ven smaller to-day us she sat beside
Mrs. Florence Boll, tho court matron,
a big sturdy woman of evident
strength, who worn upon her left
wrist a silver chain bracelet highly
supported by handcuffs.
Mrs. Beutlnger's first tears came
when Bobert II. McCarter, her coun
sel, told tho Jury of tho treatment to
which her husband had subjected her,
Tho lawyer pointed to Mrs. Boutlngor
as a delicate little woman, only flvo
feet tall, while Meutlnger wan a burly
six-footer, welshing nioro than 200
pounds. He charged that Meutlnger
had for year. made tils wife's life one
of misery lv his brutalities and that
she onl red nt him when ho rushed
at her lo attack her.
Facing Mm. Meutlnger on the wul!
back of tho wltnews seat, a large floor
plan of tho $:.",000 Meutlnger home
In Caldwell was set up, with tho bed
room In which Mrs. Meutlnger killed
her husband conspicuously outlined.
Another pictorial thing .Mrs.
Boutlngor had to look at was a mural
painting, entitled "Power and
Menellctnce," over the Judge's chair.
It portrayed a llgure succoring
another which had fallen amc.ig
rocks.
Within two minutes after Judge
Mai tin ascended the bench tho draw

News of the wonderful success of the French troops, who, by
surprise attacks at Verdun, gained two miles on a front of more
than four miles, Is ollset by further victories for the Central Powers

lost at Verdun.
In Roumania von Mackenscn lias captured the City of Cema
