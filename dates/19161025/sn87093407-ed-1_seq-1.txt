What Is Wrong With Marriage ?
By Winona Wilcox
\\ hen two persons marry, they honestly plan to treat each other mighty well.
Any wedding day might he called "a day of good intentions." Then a man is at his maximum of gener
osity, a woman at her maximum of consecration.
For a day—perhaps for a year and a day—they maintain this high sincerity.
But sooner or later, the man or the woman, in jealousy, grief, anger or
despair asks, "What am T getting out of this, anyway?"
Note the capital "I." For THAT Is what's the matter with marriage. ,
But do not blame the egoist.
For the man made the woman what she is, and the woman made the man what
he is. And it began long, long before they were married. . »t«.
"How beautiful you are," he says. "How wonderful says she.
Then he kisses her. and she considers herself engaged, i,,r "'und forever bv a
kiss. **
But it began even before that.
