the German line north and northeast
of Verdun over a front of four and
one-third miles, penetrating it along its
entire length, in the center gaining a

interest, the offensive was delivered
approximately from the eastern bank
of the Meuse River near Bras east
ward to the Damloup territory.

EPISCOPALIANS TAKE STAND
ON THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC.
Favors Legislation in Interests of Tax
payer and Suppression of Traffic.
St. Louis, Mo., Oct. 24. For the first
time in the history of the church, ac
cording to well informed leaders, a
6tand on the liquor traffic was taken
here today in the general convention
of tine Protestant Episcopal church. A
resolution adopted by the house of
deputies placed the church on record
as favoring "such action in our legis
lative assemblies as will preserve the
Interests of temperance and the repres
sion of the liquor traffic."
The action was an outgrowth of a
memorial asking the convention to re
cord Itself as favoring nation-wide
prohibition, submitted by the church
temperance society through Francis L.
Stetson of New York.
The saloon was scored in the report
.of the committee headed by Rev.
James E. Freeman of Minneapolis,
Minn., which considered the memorial.
This said:
"Our age Is witnessing vast and
universal readjustment with reference
to the manufacture and sale of liquor,
and it is generally recognized that the
saloon has become more and more
menacing to the best interests of our
corporate and individual life."
A report showing that the church
has more than 1,080,000 communicants
and 5,700 clergymen was presented to
the house of deputies by the commit
tee on the state of the church. The
report also showed that about 1,000 of
the clergy are not engaged in paro
chial work and that there are about
63,000 school officers and teachers un
der the church with approximately
460,000 pupils.

Mr. Ford authorised the following
Statement:
"I had the pleasure to inform Presi
dent AVilson this afternoon that I had
Established the women workers of my
plant at Detroit and in the branch
factories in other cities upon a pay
equality with the men workers. I took
this step following my conference with
the president more than two weeks
ago, and I did so because of the in
spiring talk I had had with Mr. Wil
son on the forward movement among
Womankind. This principle is now in
operation and I look forward with
complete confidence to its vindication."
Mr. Ford came here late today to
show the president advertisements
purporting the AVilson administration
which he plans to have published prior

O'LEARY BRINGS SECOND
SUIT AGAINST M'CORMICK
Based on a Statement McCormick is
Said to Have Given to Newspaper
New York, Oct. 24. Vanes C. Mc
Cormick, chairman of the democratic
national committee, was served late
today with a summons and complaint
in a second suit for libel brought
against him by Jeremiah A. O'Leary,
one of the heads of the American In
dependence Conference. The action,
which is for J100,000, is based on a
statement Mr. McCormick is said to
have given to the newspapers on Mon
day. This statement, it was asserted,
was in connection with charges by the
democratic national committee that a
secret agreement was made between
O'Leary and his associates and
Charles E. Hughes, republican presi
dential nominee, by which Mr. Hughes
made speeches to conform to "de
mands of the American Independence
conference.
O'Leary's first suit against Mr. Mc
Cormick was based on a statement Mr.
McCormick is said to have made con
cerning O'Leary after the later had
sent a telegram to President Wilson
criticising his administration. The
president replied, in substance, to O'
Leary that he would "feel deeply mor
tified" if O'Leary or anybody "like
you" voted for him.
The democratic national committee
tonight issued its "third installment"
of charges involving Mr. Hughes and
the American Independence Confer
ence. What purported to be "confiden
tial committee reports" were made
public and. were declared to "reveal
in detail the secret purposes, plans and
scope of the racial, political organiza
tion promoted by Jeremiah A. O'Leary
and his associate propagandists."
PROHIBITION PRESIDENTIAL
NOMINEE ATTACKS HUGHES
Because He Declines to Take Stand
on the Liquor Question.
Binghamton, N. Y, Oct. 24. Receipt
of a copy of a letter Charles E.
Hughes' secretary recently sent to the
Michigan Dry Federation saying that
Mr. Hughes probably would make no
declaration of his stand on the liquor
question during the campaign, caused
J. Frank Hanly. the prohibitionist
presidential candidate, here tonight to
launch a fresh attack on the repub
lican nominee.
"Hughes said the other day." Hanly
declared, "that the country needed as
never before an Abraham Lincoln and
left the intimation that it might find
a Lincoln in him, forgetful of the fact
that Lincoln in his day accepted the
challenge of invisible government,
called a million men to his side, put
muskets in their hands and bade them
shoot it to death.
Where Lincoln stood and fought,
Mr. Hughes bows in dump and siient
acquiescence."

HUGHES HAS A CROWDED
AUDIENCE IN QUEENS BOROUGH
Does Not Want Votes of Anyone Who
Has Any Interest Superior to U. S..
New York, Oct. 24. Charles E.
Hughes tonight told an audience that
crowded Scheutzen Park hall in
Queens borough that he did not want
the support "of anyone who has any
interest superior to that of the Unit
ed States, who would not instantly
champion the right and interest ot
.America against any country what
ever, who wants immunity for foreign
aggression, or who would have the
power of this nation held captive to
any foreign influence or swerved by
u'.ien machinations."
Mr. Hughes' -declaration was made
at the first of throe meetings at which
he spoke in New York city tonight.
The other two meetings were held in
Harlem and the Bronx.
There was only one attempt to
heckle the nominee and that occur
red early in his first speech. Mr.
Hughes was speaking of "democratic
promises made four years ago,"
enumerating what he termed the three
leading promises. They were, he
said:
"First, they were going to reduce the
cost of living. Second, they would not
d'Vurb the business of the country.
Third, they would provide sufficient
revenue from imports.
"No," the nominee continued, "what
did they do?"
A man in the gallery, arose.
"What did you do?" he shouted,
"as governor of New York?"
"Well." Mr. Hughes replied, as the
house echoed with cries of "Put him
out," "Sit down," "Well, T did a great
many things as governor of New York
for the people of th state of New
York."
The heckler sought .to ask another
question, but apparently was confus
ed, and sat down.
"If our friend can ask a ;stion in
telligently," Mr. Hughes said, "I will
try to answer Jm" The nominee then
went on with hits speech, which was
largely devoted to his tariff views.
At the Harlem and Bronx meetings
Mr. Hughes was frequently interrupt
ed by applause and by shouts from
the audience of "Go to it, Charley."
"Give 'em another one, Charley," and
"Hit 'em again."
Mr. Hughes will leave on the fourth
and lasct trip of the campaign Thurs
day morning.

Is Carranza
Ready to Quit?
RUMORS THAT HE IS PREPARING
TO LEAVE MEXICO
RUMORS ARE PERSISTENT
His Political Opponents in Mexico City
Base Their Claims Upon His Pro
posed Departure Mrs. Carranza
Has Already Crossed Border.
Washington, Oct. 24. Charges that
General Carranza is preparing to leave
Mexico are being freely made by his
political opponents in Mexico City.
They are based upon his decision to
leave his capital for Queretaro and
the fact that Mrs. Carranza already
has crossed the border into the United
States, accompanied by the wife of her
husband's war minister, and chief
supporter, General Obregon.
A Political Blunder.
information to this effect is reach
ing officials here from various relia
ble sources. So far nothing tangible,
tending to support the story, has come
through official channels. It is known,
however, that many officials here be
lieve General Carranza has committed
a political blunder at least if he is
not in fact preparing for flight, by
permitting his family to leave Mexico
just at this time. The trip, they say,
was certain to be construed by his
enemies as a confession of weakness.
Movements of Mrs. Carranza.
"The purpose of the visit of Mrs.
Carranza and Mrs. Obregon as ex
plained at the Mexican embassy, is
for a tour of the United States. W ord
of the arrival at the border also of
Mrs. Jacinto Trevino., wife of the mili
tary commander of Chihuahua state,
had not been received tonight. It was
pointed out, dowevej, that Trevino
has been among Carranza's staunch
est supporters and that if the first
chief believed his hold on the politi
cal situation was weakening Trevino
very probably would be warned in or
der that he also might place his fam
ily in safety.
The state department had not re
ceived tonight word that Generals
Carranza and Obregon had left Mexi
co City for Queretaro. Previous ad
vices, however, said ,that the Rrt
chief would so to that place in con
nection with the meeting of the con
stitutional convention for which dele
gates were elected last week. This is
the only explanation obtainable here
for Carranza's departure from hi?,
capital.
Persistent Regorts About Carranza
Persistent reports that Carranza was
about to leave Mexico have been in
circulation along the border for some
time. It is not known that the Amer
ican military authorities have been
able to gather any definite informa
tion in this regard outside of the com
ing of Mrs. Carranza and Mrs. Obre
gon. Many war department officials
have privately expressed their convic
tion, however, that the de facto gov
ernment, or at least General Carran
za's personal control of the political
situation, was growing steauliy weak
er. They have anticipated that the
'iin- mieht crme soon when he would
be forced to leave Mexico.
Mini inaiu point urged by General
Carranza in asking for the withdrawal
of the American troops from Mexico
was that their presence on Mexican
soil was not understood by the Mexi
can people and hindered his efforts
to establish a civil government. The
Mexican people and hindered his ef
forts to establish a civil government.
The Mexican commissioners at Atlan
tic City have presented this view to
their American colleagues, but so far
have not succeeded in convincing the
Americans of the ability of their gov
ernment to protect American border
life and property should the troops
be withdrawn.
While official reports on progress
at Atlantic City were closely guarded,
it has become increasingly apparent
here that the continuance of disturb
ed conditions throughout Mexico is op
erating asainst the commissioners in
their efforts to reach a solution of the
border problem.
GERARD TAKES LUNCH

ly that he had discussed the subma

Britain Releases
American Tobacco
HELD FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY
WITH IMPORTANT CONDITIONS
ABOUT $2,500,000 WORTH
Was Held Pending Proof That the To
bacco Was Paid for Prior to August
4 and Had Been Shipped Before
August 31.
Washington. Oct. 24. Release of be
tween $2,000,000 and $3,000,000 wortl
of American tobacco held at Copen
hagen and Rotterdam because of fail
ure to comply with the conditions of
importation laid down by Great Brit
ain has been ordered as a result of
representations by the state depart
ment. The department announced to
night that it had been advised of the
action toy the British embassy, the
statement adding that "officers of the
department express much satisfaction
over the concession given in this
case."
Because of inadequate warehouse
facilities, the dampness and chilliness
of the atmosphere, the special brands
of tobacco designed solely for use in
those countries would have been al
mose a complete loss unless relief had
been given quickly.
The announcement follows
Statement by British Embassy
"The British embassy has made the
following statement in regard to the
American tobacco bought by dealers
for shipment to Scandinavia and Tht
Netherlands and affected by the re
strictions put into effect on July 15
last:
"Shipment of tobacco made undei
bona tide contracts entered into be
fore July 15. need not be consignee
to The Netherlands Oversea Trust, oi
covered by guarantees in the case ot
shipments to Scandinavia, provided
that the consignments shall have been
put on rail under a through bill of
lading for land or sea carriage, or
shipped under a direct steamship bill
of lading before August 31.
"The British authorities regarded as
most important the provision that the
goods must have been- shipped on a
through bill of lading for land and sea
carriage, or under direct ocean bill,
before August 31 and they must in
sist upon its fulfillment.
"It was at first announced ns a con
cession to American tobacco interests
that tobacco bought and paid for prior
to August 4, and shipped prior to
August 31, wnuid be allowed to go
forward free of the restrictions re
ferred to above. It was. found at once
that this concession was inadequate
to relieve Uie hardships -bcought upon
tobacco interests by the sudden im
position of the restrictions named and
the department of state took up the
question with the British government
and has since made every effort .pos
sible to secure a more favorable rule.
Shipments Detained.
"While the points at issue were un
der discussion a large number of ship
ments went forward and were detained
upon arrival at the various ports at
which they respectively arrived. It
is estimated that from $2,000,000 to
$3,000,000 worth of tobacco now at Co
penhagen and Rotterdam will become
subject to release under this new con
cession and that a somewhat lesser
amount put on raii before August 31,
but detained at the seaboard for one
reason or another, will also be per
mitted to go forward free of all re
strictions. "Officers of the department express
much satisfaction over the concession
given in the case."
