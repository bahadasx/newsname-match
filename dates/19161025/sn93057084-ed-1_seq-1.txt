We present our readers with a
pretty big supplement this week—
to be repeated next week—con
taining the referred laws and
amendments to the state constitu
tion which are to be voted on at
the election Nov. 7th. Coming at
the season of the year when farm^
ers are busy with their harvest,
one cannot blame them much for
not reading or perusing the long
er laws or amendments submitted
to them but The Press does not
consider that a sufficient excuse
for a wholesale slaughter,—or
even a partial slaughter—of some
thing that the voter admits he
hasnt had time to read, and un
doubtedty has before rend pre
judiced comments on them. In
criminal cases, .especially, many
courts instruct the jury to give the
indicted party the "benefit of the
doubt/' The Press really believes
that is the right way for the
voter to do when voting on refer
red laws and amendments on which
he feels he is not as fully informed
as he might be.
That the farmer is busy at this
season of the year is no excuse for
his being ignorant of what a re
ferred ballot contains, or not hav
ing had time to read it nine times
out of ten, we'll bet that if the re
ferred ballot was presented to him
at anv other time of the year.
what with his automobiles, and
ambition to put in crops by the
hundreds of acres, et cetera, he
still wouldnt have time to read it,
and would go around trying to get
other people's opinions, when at
least he ought to read enough of
such ballot to form bis own opin
ion, from an unbiassed judgmeut.
"What will you say to the Judge
in the morning?" for your ignor
ance? By the way, the law says
that "ignorance excuses no one!"
Is not such the case with referred
laws and Amendments?

60VERN0R CLARK OF IOWA POINTS
OUT THE BENEFITS OF PROHIBITION
EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, STATE OF IOWA.
Des Moines, May 31, 1916.
Mr. Franklin W. Collins, Billings, Montana:
Dear Sir—I received several clays ago your letter with reference
to conditions in this state, in connection with the liquor business.
I have been out of the city practically all of last week, hence
the delay in answering your letter.
I Buppose that it is true that the larger cities lost some revenuo
on account of the closing of the saloons, but no such bankrupt con
ditions exist at all as are referred to in your letter. Generally as to
the effect of prohibition in Iowa, I may say to you that Mayor Han
na, who recently closed a term of six years as mayor of the city of
Des Moines, says: That this is a fact that arrests for intoxication
and for assault and battery and tor disturbing the public quiet, and
for petty larcenies have been reduced in number from 40 to 15 per
cent each within that time that 40 per cent fewer persons have 4*
been sent to the state hospital for inebriates and that the commit- 4«
ments to the state hospitals for the insane have decreased very ma- 4*
terially within that time that demands on the poor fund have been 4*
greatly reduced. That practically all the merchants in the city re- 4*
port that collections on sales have been very much improved. He 4*
also advises me that it is a fact that shipments of intoxicants into 4*
the city have been reduced so that there are not more than one- 4*
eighth to one-tenth as many as there were a year ago, so that it 4
may be said that the clipping does not state the facts that really ex- 4*
ist at all. Very truly yours, G. W. CLARK, Governor. 4*

Eagle Butte News:—John Clnv
jiore suffered a heavy loss by fire
at his ranch near Mos.sman, last
Friday afternoon his horse barn
16x40, cattle barn 16x60 nnd
wagon shed, four horses, all his
harness and 16 loads of good hay
were burned. The loss is a serious
one, coining at this season of the
year when so little time is left be
fore winter to supply new build
ings for shelter of his stock, while
the loss of first quality hay cannot
be replaced except by purchase.
The fire was started by his five
year-old boy who took his young
er sister out to watch him do some
branding the first preparations for
which was the lighting of the fire
in some hay in one of the stalls of
the barn which was heavily bed
ded and from which the flames
quickly spread all over the inter
ior of the building. The screams
of the little girl attract
ed the attention of Mrs. Clay
more but she was unable to save
anything with the exception of the
buggy. There was no insurance.
Mr and Mrs Ducharme were
down a few days ago
Mr and Mrs Clarence Currier
were over Tuesday to see his bro
ther Lester, who is in the hospital.
It is expected that the latter will
be able to return home by another
week.

POPULAR GOVERNMENT IS OVER
THROWN IN SOUTH DAKOTA!
Shall the People Rule?
Officialdom has lepealed the
Richards primary law which the
people adopted by the-direct vote
in 1912, and which the people,
themselves refused to repeal by a
second vote in 19U. The 1915
legislature, nevertheless, repealed
it and also attached the emergency
clause to prevent the people from
referring this act of the legislature
to a vote.
The politicians do not want the
Richards law. They want the se
cret spoils system for the few, in
place of the open merit system for
everybody. They want the pre
sent confused ballot. They do not
want issues discussed so the people
can hear both sides before they
vote as is provided in the Richards
law.
The people have therefore again
petitioned for the Richards law
iu amended form to be voted on at
November election. Vote "YES"
and put it back to ^give it a fair
trial, and let officialdom know that
