KKKLKR BROTHERS' ANSWER TO MAYOR'S OBJECTIONS TO
RAILROAD ORDINANCE
Mayor mistaken ng to scope or proposed amendment. As n law
yer you know mid can demonstrate to hint and council that amend
ment does not apply to any warrants except for railroad purposes!
does not repeal any debt limit whatever except for railroad, which Is
limited not to exceed $300,000, does not include any proposition ex
cept Incurring Indebtedness for railroad construction, and does not
repeal any charter provision except In so far as same would other
wise Interfere with carrying out particular object of this amend
ment, namely construction of u railroad.
The provinlons of the charter with regard to ull other matters, ex
oept tlie construction of a railroad, remain as they were.
All other Oregon cities for which we are preparing proceed
ings Iwve already adopted this Identical amendment.
Every purchaser. of municipal securities prefers bonds to war
rants, consequently no warrant will be issued unless proceeding
taken Immediately thereafter to fund same, Inasmuch as amend-
inent contains no proposition except Incurring indebtedness ror rail
road. -
o
Our attorneys have given thbt matter long and careful attention
in connection with several Orejiou clt leu, and they ad vtae this amend
imMit. It provides method of carrying out wishes of citizens for con
struction of railroad In manner which in their opinion wlH avoid
so far as possible any "ground ror litigation, such ns' Roseburg and
other cities not using this amendment have experienced, and will
enable railroad undertaking to be carried out satisfactorily, both to
city and to bond purchasers.
