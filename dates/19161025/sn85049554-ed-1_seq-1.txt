believed the energies of
the French were being bent in the bat
tle of the Somme., Thus it came about
that what was intended fof a small
maneuver became a brtljlaut practical
success.
•file attack was planned for ten (lays
ago. Artillery began preliminary
woflc but rather ra.lny weather set it?
an d_ grand headquarters ordered a
postponement.
Colonials Play Important Part.
When the time came,the attack was
delivered by four columns of foOr di
visions each. The first was on -the
west of Pepper hill. This met with
little difficulty. Th$ attackers car
ried th4 Thlamount works and farm
knd the Haudremont quarries, set as
the objective, and gained the Braa
,Douaymont rolkd beyond. There tha,
attack stopped, having advanced aibout
a mile.
The second column was a colonial di
vision under General Mangfti, from-the
corps which retook Douaumont fprt last
May. The task assigned^ it was to
take "hill 320, northeast of Fleury' ^n'l
on the'edge of Caillette wood. The of
fensive there was even more fapid than
on the left wink. General Mangin im
mediately saw he could advance far
ther and the commanding officer was
therefore informed that preparations
had been made to continue the attack.
Hill 320 was rushed by troops from
Fleury, which approached thni the ra
vine of death, Calllette. They then
crossed the wood and reached the ap
proaches to Douaumont fort.
Everywhere the Germans gave way
before them. However, the garrison of
the fort hurriedly prepared to defend
the important point, confided to It.
French troops surrounded the fort and
extended their gains everywhere with
out an Instant's delay. Fatigue parties
set to work turning the defenses so as
to be ready to resist counter attacks
west of the fort. The village of Dou
aumont had'been carried at a run'and
the troops passed beyond.
Deadly Struggle at Fort.
Meanwhile a stiff struggle went on
between the French and the defenders
of the fort. The Germans refused to
surrender and tfie French killed nearly
half of them before they forced theifi
aelves Into TM"^alns
,---
On the right things went equally well.
The third column reached the edge of
Vaux pond and carried" a part of the
Vaux-Chapitre wood still held by the
enemy, as well as Fumln wood. The
column stopped north of these woods
on the outskirts of the village of Vaux.
The fourth column, ordered to oper
ate near Vaux wood, followed oht Its
program. It drove the Germans from
Chenols and Jjausee wood, captured
Damloup battery and pushlpg ahead, en
circled Vaux fort on the east, south and
west, so that the defenders have no way
of Issue except to the north.

Important Military Move by

Germans Sink Five More Norwegian
Vessels.
Today's French report announced
an important military move In the
Balkans, where Italian cavalry
from southern Albania have formed
a Junctioirwith the cavalry and ar
tillery of the entente in Macedonia.
This gives the entente a front of
250 miles from Avlona, Albania, on
the Adriatic, to the mouth of the
Struma river, east of Salonlkl, on
the Aegean coast.
Paris, Oct. 25.—The Italian cavalry
from southern Albania formed a Junc
tion yesterday with cavalry and artil
lery of entente forces on the Macedon'
lan front yesterday, the, war office
announced today.
The Italian forces occupied the Al
bania.!! seaport of j?vlona before Italy
entered the war against Austria. No
further operations of consequence were
undertaken by the Italians for some
time but In the last few months there
have been occasional reports that rein
forcements were being sent to Albania,
and that Italian detachments were
pushing their way eastward. Southern
Albania is regarded by Greece as with
in its sphere of influence and towns in
this region have been under control
of Greek officers. The Greek represen
tatives were required to withdraw from
towns taken over .by the Italians.
There has been no accurate.informa
tion heretofore as to the extent of the
Italian advances, but there is now evi
dence that this movement has been
carried forward more rapidly than pre
vlous advices had indicated. The en
tente allies now have an unbrokeiy
front across the Balkan peninsula from,
the Aegean sea, at the mouth of the
Struma river, to the Adriatic at Av
lona, a distance of 250 miles.

At the state department gratifica

quotes the British note as saying:
"The British authorities regard as
most Important the provision that the
goods must have been shipped, on a

carriage, or undefrdirect'ocean bill,be
(pre Aug. 31, and' they must Insist upon

"It was at 'first-nmbunced as -a con
cession to American tobaoco Interests
that tobacco bought and paid for prior
to Aug. 4 and shipped iprlor to Aug. 31
would be allowed to go forward free of
restrictions referred to," the announce
ment says. "It was found at once that
this concession was Inadequate to re
lieve the hardships brought upon the
tobacco interests by the eudden Impo
sition of the restrictions named, and
the department of state took up the
question with the British government
and has since made every effort possi
ble to secure a more favorable rule."

IN DOUBT AS TCADAMSON LAW.
Chief .^f Biatbirbood of. .Locomotive
Ei^ni«r'|3Mm*'ii»'iito
NeWV York, 25.—Warren S. Stone,
grand chief engineer of the' Brother
hood of Locomotive Engineers a'rtd one
of the four men chiefly responsible
for driving the Adaimson law thru con
gress under threat of a nation wide
tie-up of the railroads, has made for
mal admission, over the grand seal of
the brotherhood, to all its officers and
member* thaf he is "nj)t in position to
give any definite information" about
the Adamson law "becaiisc we do not
know yet just what the law means."
He made this admission in a circular
reproduced herewith addressed to "the.
officers and members of all divisions,
and to the chairmen and secretary
treasurers of all general committees of
adjustment." The circular was dated
at Cleveland, O., Oct. 10, 1916. It waa
signed by llr. Stone as grand chief en
gineer,'and by assistant grand chiefs
Cadle, Wills, Buigess, Kennedy, Cor
rigan, Griffing and Montgomery.
"We are receiving a number of let
ters requesting dcllnlte information re
garding the application of the Adamson
eight-hour law," says the circular,
"but we are not in position to give any
definite information on this subject,
because we do not know yet Just what
the law means. We are, however, from
time to time furnishing the general
chairmen with such information as Is
obtainable in the matter."
The day before Mr. Stone and his
colleagues signed this circular, Charles
El Hughes discussed the Adamson law
in a speech at Newark, N. J. "Hasty
legislation is likely to carry with it un
welcome surprises," lie said. "If eight
hours Is to be a 'measure or Btandard
if a day's work' f6r the purpose of
reckoning the compensation to be paid,
how are those men left who complete
the prescribed numte of miles in less
than eight hours? Have they any as
surance, if ihey^ are to be paid under
this bill on a basis of hours, that they
will .be paid on a basis of miles when
they wofic less than eight hours? And
how will a rigid eight-hour basis' of
pay affect present guaranties? There
Is much food for thought in this legis
lation, not only on the part of those
for whom It,does not provide but also
on the part" of those to whom it ex
pressly refers."
It Is apparent from the statement of
the circular sent out by Mr. Stone and
his colleagues that they are beginning
to do some of the thinking about the
Adamson law which Mr. Hughes sug
gested that they do In his Newark
,fepeecli. And they are finding that the
Jaw is not as clear as it might be. They
Are beginning to pay one of the penal
ties for haste. j.

QARRANZA PLANS FLIGHT?
Wives il President and General Obro
gon Cross Border.
Washington, Oct. 25.—Clmrges that'
General Carranza Is preparing to leave
Mexico are being freely made by his
political opponents In Mexico City.
They are based upon his decision to
leave his capital for Queretaro and
the fact that Mrs. Carranza already
has crossed-the border Into the United
States, accompanied by the wife of
her husband's war minister and chief
suppol^er, General Obregon.
Information to this effect Is reach
ing officials here from various reliable
sources. So far nothing tangible
tending to support the story has come
thru official channels.
Trip Taken as Weakness.
It Is known, however, that many of
ficials here believe General CarraAza
has committed a political blunder
at least, If he is not In fact preparing
for flight,, by permitting his family
to leave Mexico Just at this time.
The trip, they say, was certain to be
construed by his followers as a con
fession of weakness.
The purpose of the visit of Mrs,
Carransa and Mrs. Obregon,, as ex
plained at the Mexican embassy, Is
for a tour of the United States.
Word of the arrival at the border
also of Mrs. Jacinto Trevino, wife of
the military commander of Chihuahua
•State, was received last night.
Going to Convention^
The state department has nof re
ceived word that Generals Carranza
and Obregon had left Mexico City for
Quereiaro. Previous advices, however,
said that the first chief would go to
that place In connection with the meet
ing of the constitutional convention for
which delegates were elected last weeft.
This Is the only explanation obtain
able here for Carranza's departure from
his capital.
The main point urged by General
Carranza in asking for the with
drawal of American troops from Mex
ico was that their presence on Mexi
can soil was not understood by the
Mexican people and hindered his ef
