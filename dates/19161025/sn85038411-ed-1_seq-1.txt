North of Verdun; Have
Possession of Fort Douau
mont Which Is in Flames
The "process of closing In on Ru
mania from both sides is being: con
tinued by the armies of the Central
Powers. Tchernavoda on the Danube
and Vulcan Pass on the Transylvanian
border have been captured. The loss
of Tchernavoda by the Russ-Ru
manian forces to Field Marshal Von
Mackensen's victorious armies is con
ceded by Petrograd which announced
the evacuation of this important town,
from which stretches the only bridge
across the Danube from ■ Dobrudja,
carrying the railway line running
into interior Rumania.
Important entente forces evidently
remain on the Dobrudja side of the
Danube as Petrograd mentions the
continued retreat of Russ-Rumanian
troops northward along the Black sea
coast. Berlin comments that the loss
of Tchernavoda deprives them of
their last railroad communication.
Opens Another Route
The Austro-German success on the
north likewise is important as open
ing another route into Rumania from
Transylvania for General Von Falken
hayn's forces. This pass penetrates
the Transylvania Alps half way be
tween the iron gate of the Danube
and Rothenberg Pass below Herr
manstadt.
Petrograd announces a success for
the Russians near Dorna Watra, flose
to the junction of the frontiers of
f Bukowina, Hungary and Rumania,
£ where the Austro-German forces have
been driven from a series of heights.
Reporting on the French advance
at Verdun, Berlin says the attack
gained ground as far as Fort Douau
mont, which was in flames and that
the was continuing.
German submarine attacks on Nor
wegian shipping continue. To-day five
additional Norwegian vessels arc re
ported sunk.
The French have maintained the
important ground they won yesterday
in their coup north of Verdun, the
War Office announced to-day.
Last night parts of the regained ter
ritory which includes Fort Douaumont
and stretches along a front of more
than four miles at points nearly two
miles inside the former German lines,
were subjected to a German counter
attack.
The French held their ground, how
ever. according to Paris, repulsing
the German assaults, which were de
livered in efforts to recapture the
Haudromont quarries, west of Douau
mont, and the Damloup battery
southeast of Vaux. The commander
at Fort Douaumont is among the pris
oners taken by the French, which a
preliminary report placed at 3500 men.
For Vaux is still in German hands
but the French lines run beyond it on
both sides.
Rain is interfering with operations
on the Somme front. Only artillery
actions are reported in that area.
To-day's French official report an
nounces an important military move
in the Balkans where Italian cav
alry from Southern Albania has
formed a junction with cavalry and
artillery from the entente front in
Macedonia. This gives the entente an
unbroken front of 150 miles across the
southern Balkan peninsula from
Avlona, Albania, on the Adriatic to
the mouth of the Struma river, east
of Saloniki, on the Aegean coast.

<Zd
UPPER END SOLID
FOR REPUBLICANS,
CANDIDATES TOLD
Great Rally at Elizabcthvillc
One of Best and Biggest
in History of Town
Elir.abethville turned out In force
last night to welcome the Republican
candidates, who were in that town for
the first rally of the present campaign.
The meeting was held in the Star
Theater, which was crowded to the
doors, many being unable to find seats.
The sentiment throughout the upper
end, many party workers reported, is
all for Hughes and the Republican
ticket, and the result on election day
will be a sweeping Republican victory.
Many Progressives and not a few
Democrats were present last night.
Among them were several former Pro
gressive committeemen who are out
this year for Hughes. This is in sharp
contrast with four years ago, when the
Taft men at any meeting might have
been counted on the fingers of two
hands.
Elizabethville is the home of County
Recorder James E. Lentz and he was
In charge of arrangements. The Eliz
abethville band played during the
meeting, which was called to order by
So.uire I. S. Daniels, a prominent upper
end Republican, and Recorder Lentz
was the first speaker, dwelling mainly
upon the local ticket and saying a kind
word in its behalf.
The other speakers were David J.
Rechtel and Ira Ulsh. candidates for
..the Legislature; Charles E. Pass, Sen
j "tor Reldleman and Congressman
1 1 Kreider. Senator Beidleman is verv
• popular in the upper end, which has
strong sympathies with the mining ele
ment, on account of his excellent rec
ord on mtne legislation both as a mem
ber of the House and Senate. He got
a warm reception and after the meet
j ing was assured of hearty support
! throughout the whole upper part of
the county.
Kreider Speech a Hit
Congressman Kreider. who is as
sured of re-election-, made a wonderful
; impression amonj unper en- 1 people
last night. He has been in Congress
ever since President Wilson's in
auguration and has been a close ob
server and a strenuous opponent of
i most of tlia policies that have made
Mhe Democratic rnrty so unnopular.
He went at length into the Mexican
| policy of the President, showing that
i resent conditions in that troubled re
! public are largely attributable to him.
I and flayed Congress for its reckless
I expenditure of money on a scale hun
-1 dreds of millions of dollars in excess
jof the appropriations of any of the
; Republican Congresses which were de
: rlared in the 1912 platform as "ex
jtravagant." He pointed out that
whereas that platform had declared
against the "needless offices" of Re
j publicans, the Democrats themselves
| have since then created 30,000 new
offices. ft was 10.30 when he con
cluded, but not a man had left the
| hall.
• At Berr.v.slnirg
Another large meeting was held at
, Rerrysburc. Morris Daniels presided
l there, while his brother was accorded
| a like honor in Elizabethville. The
Porrysburg band played. Speeches

"Divided Allegiance"
New York, Oct. 25. Charles E.
Hughes last night opened his last big
tour before election day with three
meetings, one in Queers, one in Har
lem and one in the Bronx, signalizing
the occasion with a definite repudia
tion of any class or interest or na
tionality opposed to Americanism.
It was in Schuetzen Park Hall, in
Queens Borough, where citizens of
German descent dominated, that the
Republican nominee said he did not
want the support of any persons ad
vocating alien interests.

Man Beaten by Thugs Is
Found Unconscious in
South Harrisburg Street
Beaten into unconsciousness by
thugs the police believe, less than two
squares from his home, D. C. Potter
709 South Front street, was found
early this morning by Dr. C. V. Hart,
lying in the street. City detectives
to-day could learn little of the attack
orr Potter, as he was still unconscious
at a late hour this afternoon. Potter
is suffering from a fractured arm, and
severe bruises of the body. It was
thought at first that he had been
struck by an automobile and left
lying in the street, but police doubt
this story. His condition is serious.
Bomb Badly Damages
New York Subway Station
! N'ew York. Oct. 25. Explosion
I of a bomb or dynamite at the 110 th
: street station of the Lenox avenue
j subway line early to-day did con
isiderable damage to that station,
j smashed the ticket agent's booth, in
jjured the agent slightly, broke the
| electric lamps and windows, tore off a
'portion of the sidewalk overhead and
broke the windows in some of the
apartment houses nearby. There was
no train at the station or near it at
the moment. Traffic in the subway
; was suspended for half an hour or
more as the result of the blast.
Subway employes at that station
said they saw no one loitering about
! and did not know how the explosive
was brought into the station. The only
, theory they could suggest was that it
might have been set off because of the
| street railway strike which has been
1 in progress since early in .September.

Lancaster Inventor Claims
He Has Unsinkable Ship
ILancaster, Pa., Oct. 25. United
States naval authorities at League
Island are investigating a model ship
mode by Charles K. Baker, of this city,
who claims torpedoes cannot sink it.

He sent his model to the Navy De
partment at Washington and was di
rected to report at League Island for
a consultation with the officers, lie
spent several days there and the naval
officers think his plan is feasible. They
will construct a large model on the

idea. He says that if it is adopted by
the Navy Department, he will be paid
for it. If it is turned down by those
authorities, he will take the matter up
