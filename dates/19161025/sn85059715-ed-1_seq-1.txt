PARIS, Oct. 25.?Verdun, long lost
Bight of, came suddenly and unex
pectedly today in the forefront of the
public mind which exclusively had
been directed toward the battle of
the Somme. The German front on
the right bank of the Meuse literally
was swept away for a distance of
Tour and a half miles like straw be
fore the wind.
General Neville for weeks past
bad been watching the German move
ments like a lynx, carefully calcu
lating the effect of every withdrawal
of troops for transfer to the Somme
and eastern front. At the same time
he quietly made his preparations and
when he judged the Germans had
thinned their defenses to the danger
point he struck liko lightning. The
result was one of the most brilliant
operations of the campaign.
The Germans who yesterday were
pressing close on the inner lines of
defense at Fort Suvuille and
Tavannes have now been driven be
yond the outer defenses of the Fort
Douaumont-Vaux line. Vaux fort re
mains in possession of the Germans,
but the French line extends beyond
it on the north at Vaux village and
Fumin wood and also on the sou|h
of it at Damloup battery and Che
^nois wood from both of which posi
tions it can readily be attacked.
The French artillery preparation
was brief brt^ intense and was over
before th* German commanders had
time to brin?up re-enforcements ev
en if they Vere available. The as
saulting French waves caught them
before the Germans recovered from
their surprise and swept over trench
after trench.
French losses were very light, it is
believed, even lighter than any re
corded in the attacks on the Somme
front.
News of the success has caused tre
mendous public enthusiasm here and
this is all the greater because of the
greater impression that Verdun was
over and done with and that both
sides were contenting themselves with
holding what they had won. Today's
operations proving that the French
could strike a smashing blow at Ver
dun while carrying on an extended
offensive on the Somme has greatly
increased public contlfidence and gone
far to lessen the depression caused by
the loss of Constanza.

NO SALE LIMIT
All Restrictions Are Removed

Through an oversight, Sturm and

its advertising matter the removal
of the purchasing limit for the one

Last year, the privilege of pur

tended to purchasers at a similar one

limit is removed altogether. Any

by the management with that in view,
it being the idea to move as much of

"There are very good reason* why i
