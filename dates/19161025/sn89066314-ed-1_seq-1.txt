Cernavoda and Bridge Over
Danube Are Captured by
the Bulgarians.
BLOW SERIOUS ONE
Bucharest Open to Attack
From East One Army
Cut Off From Aid.
By United Press
BERLIN, Oct. 25. Cernavoda, east
ern terminus of the great 14-mile
railway bridge crosslngthe Danube
Into Rumania, was' capture by Field
Marshal von Mackensen's army this
morning, it was officially announced
this afternoon.
The victory is regarded as vastly
more important than the capture of
the seaport of Constanza several days
ago.
Loss of Cernavoda is admitted by
the Russian war ''office and by
Bucharest. Dispatches fromgthese
points say it is a more serious blow
to the Rumanian from the military
standpoint than the fall of Constanza.
It not only cuts ofNthe retreat of the
Russo-Rumanian armies driven from
the Constanza-Cernavoda Railway but
opens up the way for a drive on
Bucharest from the east, while von
Falkenhayn's Austro-German armies
are advancing from the west.
The defeated Russo-Rumanian ar
mies driven northward from the rail
way arc in a precarious position, the
Russian official statement indicated.
No other bridges cross the Danube
north of Cernavoda, and it appears
probable that unless a large part of
' the Russo-Rumanian forces escaped
across the bridge before Cernavoda
was taken they will be trapped east
of the Danube, suffering the fate of
the Rumanians at Tutrakan fortress,
where 20,000 prisoners were taken.
On thoTransylvania frontier Falk
enhayn has won another great victory,
capturing the famous Vulkan Pass.
