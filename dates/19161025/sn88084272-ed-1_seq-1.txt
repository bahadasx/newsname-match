big show in "a blaze of glory."
The admission has been reduced lo 25 cents for adults and 10 cents for
children. As Robert Jvrakauer, of the board of control, said todav. "the
2a cents admiv-ion will not hurt any El Pasoan and the accumulated 25-cent
pieces of all tboe attending will greatly help the exposition."
The exposition management is now about where it will break even on

in El laso and be distributed among the business men who put up the bic
guarantee fund to secure the exposition. Everv man will have to pay all
that be guaranteed, except what little be gets back as his pro rata from the
money that ts taken in at the exposition today and tomorrow.

The little the others contribute today and tomorrow will be their share
towards relieving the merchants from all the expense.
