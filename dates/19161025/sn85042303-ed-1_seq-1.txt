Cotton was selling on the streets
today from 18.30 to 19 cents with
quite a lot offered.
Nineteen cents was paid for some
late yesterday afternoon, which Is the
highest price ever paid for the b tu
ple In the history of the city. Cotton
buyers are predicting that cotton will
go to 20 cents and gome are so op
timistic that they are of the belief
that it will exceed that figure.
There la quite a. lot of cotton yet
to be gathered in various parts of
the country but the general estimate
at present Is that the total receipts
from wagon will not exceed 10,000
bales. However, there are a few who
predict that the twelve thousand-bale
mark will be passed. Up to last
night approximately 7,300 bales had
been received at the local yards. Cot
ton lias been coming In rather lively
today and the total figures tonight
will probably be around the 7,500
mark.

IMMEDIATELY T R E V I N O'S
WIFE AT JUAREZ.
San Antonio. Tex, Oct 23. Gen
eral Trevlno. commanding Chihuahua
City, has warned all residents to leave
the city according to a report to Gen
eral Funston today from Ceneral Bell
at Kl Paso.
General Hell said Mrs. Trevlno was
among the refugees arriving at Juarez
from Chihuahua.
FARMERS ARE PROSPEROUS.
Broom Corn Crop at Lindsay Sold at
I Fancy Prices.
, Lindsay. Okla.. Oct. 27,. This city
I has the most prosperous fall
I it has ever had. This Is due to the
I broom corn crop which has Just been
j harvested. From this city 2S0 cars
i of broom corn have been shipped and
' there Is enough In storare to bring
i the total shipment up to 5'H) cars.
I The top price paid this fall for the
crop was 1212.50 a ton. All growers
have made big profits this year, and
are enjoying the high prices that are
being paid for all products from the
farm.
Washington. Oct. 23. Charges that
ileneial ( arranza Is preparing to leave
Mexico ate being freely made by li's
political opponents in Mexico City.
They are based upon Ills decision to
have his capltul for Queretaro and
tlie fact that Mrs. Carranza has al
ready crossed tho border into the
I'uited Stales, accompanied by tlx)
wl'e of her husband's war iniuister
anil chief supporter, General Obregou.
Makes Political Blunder.
Information to this effect Is reach
ing officials here from various re
liable sources. So far nothing tan
gible tending to support the, story has
come through official channels. It U
known, however, that many officials
believe General Carranza has com
mitted a political blunder at least, if
he Is not In fact preparing for flight,
by permitting ills family to leave Mex
ico Just at tills time. The trip, they
say, was certain to be contsrued by
his followers as a confession of weak
ness. The purpose of the visit of Mrs. Car
ranza and Mrs. Obregon, as explained
at the Mexican embassy, Is for a tour
of the I'nited States. Word of tho
arrival at the border also of Mrs. Ja
cinto Trevlno, wife of the military
commander of Chihuahua state, had
not been officially received tonight
It was pointed out, however, that Tre
vlno has licen aiming Carratiza's
staunches) supporters and that If tha
first chief believed his hold on the
political situation was weakening,
Trevlno very probably would be warn
ed in order that he might also place
ills family In safety.
In Quaretaro for Convention.
The state department had not re
ceived word tonight that General Car
ranza and General Obregon bad left
Mexico City for Quaretaro. Previous
advices, however, said the first chief
would go to that place in connection
with the meeting of the constitutional
convention for which delegates were
elected last week. This Is the only
reason obtainable here for Carranza'
departure from his capital.
Persistent reports that Carranza
was about to leave Mexico have been
In circulation along the border for
some time. It is not known that the
American military authorities have
been able to gather any definite infor
mation In this regard outside of tiie
coming of Mrs. Carranza and Mrs.
Obregon. Many war department of
ficials have privately expressed their
conviction, however, that the de facto
government, or at least General Car
ranza's personal control of the politi
cal situation, was growing steadily
weaker. They have another report
that the time might come soon when
he would bo forced to leave Mexico.
Troop Withdrawal.
The main point presented by Gen
eral Carranza for the withdrawal of
the American troops from Mexico was
their presence on Mexican soil was
not understood by the Mexicans. The
Mexican commissioners at Atlantic
City have presented this view to their
American colleagues but so far have
not succeeded in convincing the Am
ericans of the ability of their govern
ment to rotect American border life
and property should the troops be
withdrawn.
WhHe official reports on progress
from Atlantic City are closely guard
ed. It has become Increasingly appar
ent here that the continuance of dis
turbed conditions throughout Mexico
is operating against the commission
ers In their rricrts to reach a solution
of the border problem.
