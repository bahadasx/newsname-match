The attendance of stockholders was

were in the room. Eventually the
number increased to about SO. Copies

of a statement recently made by Presi

tion of their acts. . t i
Mr. Bogigian said he was satisfied
and he desired to thank Mr. Elliott
for his stand on the eight hour law
and for his courage before the public
service commission of Massachusetts
when to the demand for gold. cars and
gold rails he promptly said that the
company could not afford it.
Maxey Hiller made an . address in
which he attacked the policy of pay
ing high salaries to officers, of paying
a salary 6f from $20,000 to $25,000 for
a publicity agent, who is "a mine of
inaccurate information," of paying
$10,000 to one of the counsel of the
company. Of the last mentioned item
he said that in response to inquiry
why the salary was so large an of
ficer replied:
"Well, he (the lawyer) is a very
fine gentleman and he is a very fine
dancer.' ' '
Mr. - Hilier declared that directors
like Messrs. Hadley and Whitney, who
are the heads of large enterprises, are
busy men ani cannot giye ajl the at
tention necessary to the railroad com
pany. He believed that Jnstlad of
having all millionaires on the board,
some men who have less money, more
time and more experience on the board
Should be elected. Mr. Hiller had con
fidence in Mr. Elliott and other direc
tors but he believed that they should
look more carefully after the road's
affairs and help restore dividends to
those stockholders who have suffered
so severely.
Mr. Hiller said that if he had the
eloquence of -President Elliott, he
"would make the rafters sing de
manding dividends for the poor peo
ple, who have lost their incomes from
the stock'." .
The directors should practice rigid
economy even to the point being
peburious. Mr. Hiller- said that the
decision to build a new station. in New
Haven was because the owner of a
newspaper, and a. corset maker "who
dictates the destinitles of the Repub
lican -party here"" had threatened "to
make in warm for the company" and
so the directors agreed to saddle
more debt on the company.

SANFORD SOON TO
LEAVE DUTIES IN
FEDERAL RESERVE
Bridgeport's Class A Direc
tor Will Terminate Ser
vices With New Year.
LOCAL CLEARANCES
MADE IN NEW YORK
Director Believes Rearrange
ment of Banks Will Bene
fit the City.
Bridgeport will lose its personal rep
resentation in the Federal Reserve
banks at the close of 1916. At that
time Charles G. Sanford's term of of
fice as a class A director in. the Fed
eral banking system will expire. No
election of a successor is likely, from
present indications. 1
Though great regret is expressed In
banking circles today at the prospec
tive retirement of Mr. Sanford, whose
knowledge of all state matters con
nected with finance and fiduciary af
fairs has been deeply rooted through
his presidency over the First-Bridgeport
National bank of this city, yet
Mr. Sanford states that the combina
tion of -circumstances which relieves
him of the many arduous duties con
nected with the office will greatly ben
efit banks to Fairfield county.
With the passing of the Class "A"
directorship from Bridgeport, the In
terests of Connecticut will be left in
the hands of Henry R Towne, of
Stamford and New York, who ranks
as a Class "B" director representative
of the business interests, rather than
directly representing the banking in
terests, as does Mr. Sanford. ;
The situation which brings about the
retirement of Mr. Sanford at the ex
piration of his appointive term is that
all Fairfield county banks; about 15 in
number, have for convenience in clear
ing, correspondence, etc., been trans
ferred from the Boston to the New
Tork district. - " -- '
' At the inception of the Federal Re
serve banking act Fairfield county
with Connecticut as a whole had been
apportioned to the Boston district.
The great volume of banking busi
ness in Bridgeport and the county for
many years has been done through
New York. The obligation of central
izing business at Boston was such a
hardship to local banks that an appeal
for a new ruling resulted In the trans
fer of the entire county to New York,
thereby greatly facilitating the con
duct of business. It Is predicted in
Bridgeport, banking directorates that
ultimately the entire state of Con
necticut will be included in the New
York banking zone. This action while
likely to eventuate is not probable
within the next year, however.
In the election of a successor to Mr.
Sanford, Fairfield will have a repre
sentation of about 15 banks as against
about 250 located In New York. As the
office Is one keenly sought by bankers
throughout the country the small rep
resentation of Connecticut banks now
in the New York district will It Is
thought be insufficient to again elect
Mr. Sanford or any other Connecticut
Class "A" director.
HEARD NO CRIES
IN NEIGHBORHOOD
OF MURDER SPOT
Two Men Who Passed In
Vicinity Sunday Morn
ing Interrogated.
DesDite the finding of two men, both
of whom passed through the field, at
Railroai and South avenues, between
the hours of 1 and 4 o'clock. Sunday
morning, the period during which Mi
chael Yorko was killed and. mutilated,
no additional light has been threwn
one one of the most baffling murder
mysteries with which the local police
have ever had to deal.
Barney Connors, an employe of the
Crane Co., and John O'Leary, who
works in the gas plant close to the
scene, are the two men whom the po
lice have found -who passed through
the lot. Connors at 1 o'clock was at
the scene and O'Leary passed close to
the remains about 4 o'clock, last Sun
day morning.
Yorko is believed to have been killed
shortly after midnight, which would
have made it possible for Connors to
have seen the murderer if the latter
was in the vicinity. "Both of them,
however, assert hat they heard no
outcries and saw no one in the field..
They have, however, furnished De
tective James Dooley with the descrip
tions of several suspicious characters
whom they passed on the streets ad
jacent to the lot.
Owing to the location of the botfy
and the darkness of the body, it
would have been almost impossible
for a person crossing the field to see
the body. The only valuable informa
tion they police could hope to obtain
from persons who passed the scene,
would be a description of the mvfr-
derer, who they might have seen.
The statement that footprints of
the murderer were in the possession
of the police was corroborated today.

SLASHES WIFE AS
SHE LIES IN BED
Covers Corpse With Sheet
and Then Goes Out to

New Britain, Oct. 25 Joseph Sal
erno, aged 25, murdered his wife,
Bridgetta, aged 24, by cutting her
throat with a razor at their home on
West Main street, Plainville, about 5
o'clock this morning. Two hours
later he went to a nearby pond, cut
his throat and either fell or Jumped
in. 'He was found sitting on a box on
the bank and was broaght to the New
Britain hospital. , It is believed he
will die.
Mrs. John Costello, who lives in a
tenement under tht& occupied by the
Salernos, heard screams at about 5
o'clock and believing that a domestic
quarrel was in progress in the upper
tenement, locked the doers. She says
she heard Salerno walliiiig about the
house later. He left the house and
went to the pond near C. H. Colter's
factory a short distance away, where
he proceeded to use the razor on him
self. ' v
When he was found his ' clothes
were wet, leading the authorities to
believe he either fell or Jumped into
the water.
So far as neighbors and friends
know, the domestic life of the Sal
ernos has been peaceful. The husband
appeared to be industrious and inter
ested in his home. Last night ' he
helped his wife to take in their family
washing and they appes red to be
happy and contented.-'
Salerno has been out of work for a
week. He was employed in a Plain
ville factory but gave up his position'
when the other workmen threatened
to strike, believing Salerno was work
ing for less money than he , should
have received.- The ' Salernos were
married about four years ago .nd had
no children. , .
When the medical examPner, . C. W.
Moody, and Dr. 'J. N. Bull went to
the Salerno home, they found Mrs.
Salerno lying on the bed clothed only
in her night robe. The husband had
carefully covered the corpse with a
sheet previous to leaving the house.
Friends of Salerno say he must have
been insane when he killed Ms wife.

to clear up misunderstandings due to
exaggerated reports of King Constan

merely submitted a memorandum, and
that the King never declared he was

Are Killed Trying
to Capture Bandit
Washington,' Oct. 25 Officials re
ports of the death, of Captain Wil
liam Low andr First Sergeant Atwood,
in the Dominican Republic yesterday,
while attempting to arrest a bandit
were received today by the navy de
partment. .
First Lieut. John Marston, 3rd, was
injured by a fall, presumably during
the fight, although the despatch gave
no details.
The bandit, Ramon Batista, was
killed. The despatch does not say
where the fight occurred. It - adds
that conditions otherwise are quiet.
Verdun, long lost from sight, today
springs suddenly into the forefront of
the public mind which had exclusive
ly been directed toward the battle on
i-the Somme front. The German
fflSnt on the right bank of -the Msuse
literally has been" swept away for a
distance of four and a half miles like
straw before the wind.
General Nivelle. for weeks past had
been watching the German movements
like a lynx, carefully calculating the
effect of every withdrawal of troops
for transfer to the Somme and east-'
ern fronts. At the same time he
quietly made his preparations and
when he judged the Germans had
thinned their defenses to the, danger
point yesterday he struck like light
ning. The result ws one of the most
brilliant operations of the campaign.
The, Germans who yesterday were
pressing close upon the inner line of
defenses at Forts Souvllle and Tavan- '
nes, have now been driven beyond the
outer defenses of the fort Douau-mont-Vaux
line. Vaux fort remains
in possession of the Germans but the
French line extends beyond it on the
north at Vaux Village and Fumln
Wood and also on the south of it at '
Damloup and Chencis Wood, from
both of which positions it can readily
be attacked. The French artillery
preparation was brftf but Intense and
was over before the German co'm .
manders had time to bring up rein
forcements even if they were avail
able.. The assaulUng French waves
caught them before the Germans i-e- '
covered from their surprise and swept
over .trench after trench, sending
prisoners in all lines to the rear. 4
The French losses were very light,,
it is believed, even lighter than any
I recorded In the attacks oa the somme
front.
The news of the success has caused
tremendous public enthusiasm here
and this is all the greater because of
the general impression that Verdun
was over and done with and that both
sides were contenting themselves with
holding what they bad won.
Today's operation, proving ihat the
French could strike a smashing blow
at Verdun while carrying on an ex
tended offensive on the Somne. has
greatly increased public ccn ldence
and gone far to lessen the depression
caused by the loss of Constant's.
Teutons Tighten Gap
on Rumanian Boundary
Berlin, Oct. 25. The iron grip of
the central powers upon Rumania has
tightened in two important notches
with the capture of MedjiJie and
Rashova in Dobrupda and of Predeal
in the Transylvania border.. The con
quests of these important places have
been achieved with surprising speed.
With the capture of Constanza, the
Rumanians lost their principal sea
port, while the taking of Medjidle and
Rashova now places Tchernavoda In
a critical position and, in military
opinion here, threatens Rumania mere
than ever. .
The capture of Predeal comes as
climax to the recent forcing of a num
ber of Important passes from Transyl
vania into Rumania so that the cen
tral power appear to be nearly in
position to swoop down upon tne Ru
manian plains and attack the heart
of the country.
Predeal and the passes behind it
spell the loss of Rumania of its natural
western fortifications formvd by the.
mountains of Transylvania, Medjidle
and Rashova, if they lead to the cap
ture of Tchernavoda. denote with lur
tukal and Silistria the removal of the
artificial barriers to access into Ru
mania across its other natural fortinoa
tlon, the Dnube river. '
