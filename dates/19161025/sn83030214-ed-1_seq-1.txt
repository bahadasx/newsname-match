Baker Blocked Plan

'I N*a a S'.afT OBtflBBBIfldai' ? Iflfl Tribune. 1 ?
CKveland, Oct. 24. Newton D. Baker
ran truo to form ifl the recent speech '
in which h? likened Washington's
heroes of Valley Forjrc to the Mexican
baaditfl who have been detiling women,
murdering children and torturing
wounded soldiers*. The people of Mr.
Baker'j home town were not surpnsed
when tliey heard the War Secrctary's
most recent expression of his feeling
toward soldiers and things military.
AlthouRh he ought to have heroic
blood, having been born in Virginia,
the son of a captain in the Confederatc
army, Mr. Baker haa never let allp a
chance to spe ik flffliflat the army of
the present oi of history.
One thing the patriotic people of this
city hold against the present Secretary
of War is what he did as Mayor in
1913. A new city charter was then
being drafted. Mr. Baker was ehair?
man of the charter committee. Major
Charles R. Miller sujrgested that a
clause be inserted that "other things
being equal, veterans of the Civil and
Spanish-American wars be preferred"
in the civil service. H. Stillwell, a

member of the charter commission and
of the late Stute Constitutional Conven?
tion, presented a resolution authoriz
ing the drnfting committee to embody
Major Miller's suggestion in the char?
ter.
Mr. Baker opposed this, although
similar clauses are in most city char
ters. He was in control of a majority
of the commission. At the time he said,
according to a report in "The Cleve
land Leader" the next day: "The man
who volunteers for war is no more
heroic and deserves no more of his
country than the scientist. telephone
lineman. inventor or nurse who stays
behind."
No Cleveland paper, it appears,
quoted Mr. Baker more in detail than
this. Those who heard the speech say |
he was most passionate in his deter
mination to prevent the veterans from
rvceiving preference in the public ser?
vice.
The people of Cleveland have not yet
finished laughing at the peculiar in
eptnrss of such a man aa Mr. Baker
being head of the War Department.

Kock Island, 111., 0<t. 24. Secretary !
of War Newton T. Baker, in closing an
address at a Democratic mass meeting
here to-night, referred tfl the castiga
tion he received at the hands of Colonel ;
Roosevelt at Albuquerque, N. M., where
? ? ' onel called the Secretary a slan
tfarar of Washington and his Colonial
army.
"I would not attempt an answer to ?
Cfllone! Roosevelt," the Secrfltary" aaidr
"were it not that my patriotiam, my ,
love of counlry and my sense of grati?
tude to this savior oi" my country were
impugned. The Colonel's position as
the .star vilitier of his time remains
nicontestable, and therefore I retuse
to descend to his level ln reply to his
attack in the language you doubtless
leel 1 ahould.
"Never in my whole life have I ever
breathed a sentiment or voiced a word
other than one of devotion and admira- ;
tion of the part Washington played in
the rescue 01 the States from the domi
BBBCfl of a foreign power, and I have
prayed before hundred* of audiences,
that we might be sent other leaders i
such as he, should it so happen that
our country had such problems to deal
arith as (flcad GflOfgfl Washington.
"I did say his army was ill kept, half
starved when It retired from Valley
Forge. I said it was such an army as ,
rright be expected during a revolution. '
Belittlement of Washington and his
army was furtherest from my thoughts
when I contrastid eonditions in Mexico
with thfl Revolution in our own countr. :
with the Revolution in our own country
in what country it takes place.
"I did not comparc the Colonial
army with thfl army of M-xico. I sim
ply compared their eonditions. I said,
and 1 repeat it, that Mexico mu-' bfl
lat alone to scttle her own destiny ifl
her own way, hh we did during our
Revolution. If during our Revolution
a foreign power hHd intervened agamst
us mra might have a different story to
tell to-ntght.
"Plflflflfl n-member that when you are i
discussing Mexiro thfl blstory of the j
Ameriean Revolution supports the Mex
ieflfl policy of President Wilson.
"Mexico will come flul all right, but
flha never can right herself in her own '
way if rhe ia to be hampered by out- j
side influeiices. America ifl her well \
wisher and will aid her in every man
ner possible ifl rastating peace and
order, but she will go no further so

Long Branch, N. J.. Oct. 24.-Henry
Ford came down to Shadow Lawn to
day to tell President Wilson that he,
the President, got "on board the band
wagon" in supporting the eight-hour
day. In addition he announced his
"conversion" to the President s stand
on women's rights, and declared that
henceforth all women in the Ford plants
would be placed on the same pay basis
as men and be eligible for the $5 a day
minimum wage. Mr. Ford was with
the President less than half an hour.
and afterward gave out this statement:
"I had the pleasure to inform Presi?
dent Wilson this afternoon that I had
established the women workers of my
plant at Detroit and in the branch fac
tories in other cities upon a pay equal
ity with the men wo.kers. I took this
step following my conference arith the
President mcre than two weeks ago,
and I did so because of the inspiring
talk I had had with Mr. Wilson on the
forward movement among mankind.
"Among womankind this principle is
row in operation, and 1 look forward
with complete confidence to its vindi
cation."
More than 1.500 women are affected
by Ford's decision. The eight-hour day
is already in operation in the Ford
plants. Mr. Wilson's stand for the
eight-hour-law, Mr. Ford declaies, would
help manufacturers realize that the cs
tablishment of the eight-hour day
would do more than anythmg else to ,
'forward Industrial effieiency.
Mr. Ford aho declared he had "taken
off his coat" to aid in the Prcsidenfs
reelection. He has opened headquar
ters at the Hotel Riltmore in New York
to direct a great publicity campaign.
He has purchased space in leading
papers all over the country, and before
the clectioh full page advertisements
will set out his reasons for supporting
the President.
Peace. Mr. Ford declared, is one of n
score of reasons he will urge upon the
voters. He plans to direct his atten
tion particularly to New Vork State.

suffered severe reverscs on both the
Dobrudjan and Transylvanian fronts
to-day. East and west the pressure
against Rumania is growing.
Mackensen has driven the Russo-Ru
manian army sixteen nnles northwest
of the Constanza railway since yester?
day and has taken the towns of Rasova
and Mejidie. Rasova is on the Danube.
only eight miles from the Cernavoda
bridgehead, Mackensen's immediate
goal. Its capture marks the forward
rnovement of the Teutons' left wing on
a scale with that of the right wing.
along the Black Sea coast.
M^jidie, fifteen miles east of Cerna?
voda, is at the junction of the Con?
stanza railway and the road running
north from Varna. Its seizure puta
Mackensen in control of more than
half of the railway line from Con?
stanza to Cernavoda.
Entente Forrea in Flight
The Rumanians and their Russian
allies appear to be in full flight. Buch?

garian daime of vietory *"?* admita
the retreat of the Allied forces to
Tzara Murat, sixteen miles beyond
Constanza.
Meanwhile Falkenhayn ha3 struck a
heavy blow south of Kronstadt, capt
uring the town of Predeal. inside the
Rumanian border. In Red Tower pass
the Rumanian resistance also was
broken, Berlin announces. Six hun?
dred prisoners were taken by the Teu?
tons in the Predeal operation.
It is evidcnt that Falkenhayn is con
centrating his efforta against the paases
ia Southeastern Transylvania to march
on Bucharest from the north, while
Mackensen is driving at tho capital
from the east. All other plans are
being subordinated to this one great
eoup. If it succeed3 the Central Pow?
ers will have won their greatest vie?
tory of the year.
Make Desperate Stand
The Rumanians are putting up a
desperate fight against heavy odds on
both fronts. Tr.ey are still making a
stund before Cernavoda. At several
points on their western and northern
frontier they are also more than hold
ing their own.
ln three days Mackensen has capt?
ured 1,761 prisoners. rifty-two machine
~uns and twelv,- cannon. Little of this
bootv fell into Mackensen's hands at
ConaUnaa, according to Bucharest re?
ports, as the evacuaiion of the port had
been determined upon in time to effect
the removal of all the valuable sup
plies. , D
The British press is u.ting the Ku

Though there are criticisms in some

British Front on the Somme (fia
London), Oct. 24.-A viaitor to the |
British sector on the Somme is struck i
immediately with the AUies' dominance l
of the air, an advantage which cannot
possibly be appreciated unless one ia j

battlcfield.
From h certain position I have aeen

Behind tha British guns floated
twenty-four aausage balloons, while
across the shell-swept plains just three

aviators. Fluffy balls of black smoke
broke now behind, now in front and
now below the planes. but only once
did an Beroplane alter .tfl course; then,
for a moment. it seemed to dive like
a wounded bird toward its own lines,
righting if.elf immediately. Time after
time these birds, which are eyes to
the gunners, came under German fire,

These puffs of smoke high in the air

London, Oct. 24.?Verdun, whera
the German Crown Prince sacnficed
half a million men in vain, is now
the scene of a powerful Freneh of
fensive.
Smashlng through a front of four
miles, Nivelle's troops have captured
positions on the right bank <if the
Meuse for a depth of two miles. The
village and fort of Douaumont,
which have changed hands many
times since tho (Jerman drive liegan
in February; the Thiaumont work
and farm, stronjrholds of the Teuton
advaneed line; and the Haudromont
quarries, north of Thiaumont, have
fallen before the Freneh onslaught.
.ViflO Caplivea Taken
More than .'1.500 prisoners have al
ready been passed back by the
Freneh troops, and the nction is still
in progrrss. I.argit quantities of
supplies were captuntd in the rharjre,
for the suddenness with which it was
carried through gava the- (iernians
Pttle time to withdraw their jrtins
and material to the rear.
The Freneh vietory, won on ter

Bpite the maze of fortifnations that
covers the Verdun front, is a wel?
come antidote to the Teutonic vie
tories against the Kumanians. It is
evidence that Mackensen and Fal?
kenhayn cannot draw troops from
other fronts to battle for RuchareKt.
It is an omon of renewed AlUi'd
pressure against the Kaiser's lines in
the West.
With daybreak the Freneh guna be
gan to bathe the (Jerman tretiches with
shell. Recent visitors to General N'ivel
le's headquarters at Wnlun quoted
him as saying that the Freneh artillery
on thia front was finng fifty shots to
one for the Germans and soon would be
firing 100 to 1. The execution the bom
bardment did in the enerny's line tend*
to prove that statement.
Rearh Outskirts of Vaux
Soon before noon the poilus sprang to
the attaek. Then began a senes of as
saults that swpet through the tirst (Jer?
man line and btyond into the fort of
Douaumont and the village. Meanwhile
the right wmg was moving toward
Vaux, a position as much disputed as
Douaumont. Here they reached the out
skirts of the village.
On the left wing, nearer the river, the
rush was irresistible. It swept through
the Thiaumont work and farm, lying
in Iow land, dominated by ridges to the
north, into and beyond the Haudromont
quarries, which had been converted into
a ventable fortresi, and astride the
road from Douaumont to Bras.
Thus, in a few hours, the Freneh re
gained positions that it took the Ger?
mans months to win. The resistance
they met was comparatively weak. This
may have been due to the fact that tha
Kaiser's generals have withdrawn
troops to the Somme front, or lt may
have been due to the efficicney of the
artillery preparation. At any rate, the
last fragment of the Crown Prince'a
dream has been crumbled.
May Drive Toward Meta
The purpoie the Verdun offeneive
serves is twofold. It puta increased
pressure on the German forcea to offset
the drive in Rumania, and so raakes tha
task on other fronts easier. The eee
ond end it may ultmately serve ia in
preparing the way for a new drive
for Metz.
The German line in this sector ia a
very sharp salient, with ita tip at St.
Mihiel. li.t.l thia wedge .s wiped out
? Freneh push eastward ia almost im
posbible. By breaking through the
German line north of Verdun the
Freneh can flank the enerny's position
at St. Mihiel, and ao force its evacua
tion.
But the immediate effect of the at?
taek on the Meuse will be on the
Somme operatione. Wi'h the Balkan
movement in full iwing. it seems hardly
likely that the Kaiser's generali can
muster enough men to wlthstand two
rreat offensives on the Western front
When the thrusts for Peronne and
Bapaume are reiumed, .this preaaure
will be at a max mum.
