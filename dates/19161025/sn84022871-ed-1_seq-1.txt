Since the Monitor's announcement
last week of the proposed advance in
the price on many magazines and
newspapers, on, or soon after, Novem
ber 1, the office has been busy hand
ling subscriptions for its customers.
ii you are wise you will ask us to

no printed lists and can only quote on
individual lists sent or telephoned in.
Prices in most instances are now the
same as last .year. After November
1 we guarantee nothing about prices.

amount of paper on hand will be able
to continue for a long time to come
without an increase m price, and we
hope it will never come.

The theme of the morning sermon
was, "Ancient Landmarks Removed,"
from Prov. 22:28, "Remove not the
ancient landmarks which thy fathers
have set."
"A landmark is some conspicuous
object that serves as a guide. We
deal with a spiritual inheritance hand
ed down by our fathers as a rich be
quest of truth and virtue. All along
the way we find landmarks, certain
great outstanding principles, com
mandments and ordinances, estab
lishedfor our guidance by God and
the men of other days. Heeded, they
are the pledge of our .safety in . time
and in eternity. Unfortunately there
is a growing tendency among Chris
tian people to seek for greater lati
tude in their Christian life, and they
frequently attempt to remove things
from the Bible to their own detriment
and loss of spiritual power."
The sermon closed with a plea for a
return to God's word and obedience
thereto.
The evening sermon was based on I
Kings 18:21, "How long halt ye be
tween two opinions." It pictured the
folly of delay in beginning the Chris
tian life and urged the immediate ac
ceptance of Jesus Christ as a person
al Saviour.

and lost control of the car when it left
the road. The machine dashed through
the fence and turned turtle, pinning
all beneath.

back seat and managed to get out
without assistance, but Mr. and Mrs.
Morse were caught by the steering
wheel and the back of the front seat
and were crushed so badly that they
died instantly. The road is much
traveled and motorists quickly gath
ered and helped lift the car from the
victims.

PARENTS' NIGHT.
The. wisdom of the policy that
guides Barton academy and graded
school' was once again made evident'
to the public Friday evening when its
doors were opened to the parents ana
friends of the students. The response
to the invitation was gratifying to the
board and to the faculty, and the
large number of parents who attended
could not but feel that the school
stands on a par with any in the state.
The varied activities of the school
were laid out for the inspection of its
guests in a most novel and entertain
ing manner. The program prepared
by Miss Ferrin displayed the academ
ic work of the various classes; a mem
ber of each class described the work
of the students in that class in an in
teresting manner; the musical num
bers showed the ability of the boys
and girls in chorus work under the
supervision of Miss Ruggles; the re
freshments served immediately after
the program demonstrated in an ap
petizing way the work of the domes
tic science department, which is under
the capable management of Miss
Pierpont. The formal part of the
program was closed with short ad
dresses by Mr. Batchelder of the
school board, and by Mr. Bates, and
the words of both contained criticism
of a constructive and helpful nature.
After the close of the program the
guests were invited to Alumni hall
for dancing. The hall had been taste
fully decorated for the occasion under
the supervision of Mrs. Heath. With
Mr. Batchelder as floor manager, and
a fine orchestra composed of Messrs.
Cutting, Potter, Webster, Hutchins
and Blake and Miss Willson, and
amid such pleasant auspices, a most
enjoyable social hour with promenad
ing and several dances was held.
Every opportunity was jriven for
the parents to become fully acquaint
ed with the school plant in which their
children work, and to come to know
the teachers, who work with them,
and from them to learn that not only
parents' night but every day the peo
ple ot .Barton and the parents of chil
dren are welcome in the school. Un
der such circumstances, and guided
by such policies, there must be even
tually a spirit of close and under
standing cooperation between the
school and the parents that spells not
alone success but approximate perfec-
xion to tne scnoois ot Jtsarton.
