PREPARE FOR BOLL
WEEV!L SAYS GOYS
SHADOW OF APPROACHING PEST
HAS ALREADY BEEN CAST
OVER THE STATE.
PALMETTO CAPITOL NEWS
General News of South Carolina Col
lected and Condensed From The
State Capital That Will Prove of
Interest to All Our Readers.
Columbia.
That the shadow of the approaching
boll weevil has already been cast
over South Carolina and the dread
pest will arrive within another year
and within three years will overrun
the state was the prediction made by
Governor Richard I. Manning on his
return from a tour of the boll weevil
stricken territory of Lousiana, Mississ
ippi apd Alabama. The godernor says
the farmers and business men of South
Carolina must prepare for the weevil
or else dire ruin and disaster may re
st, t.
Those who shut their ears to the
warning voice brought from the farm
ers of the Mississippi valley may reap
the whh-lwind and where today they
are living in ease and plently with
good lands and good cotton crops they
may find themselves with no cotton.
their lands worth less than nothing,
their labor gone and ruin staring them
in the face if they do not prepare.
"Prepare! Prepare!" declares the
governor of South Carolina fresh
from a personal trip through these
sections of the cotton belt which have
been ravaged by the boll weevil. Here
is an instance of what the boll weevil
means:
In the parish of West Felciana.
Louisiana-a parish being a county
in 1904 there was produced 22.497
bales of cotton. Three years after the
boll weevil invaded that county in
1910 only 31 bales of cotton were rais
ed ins.the whole county. Governor
Manning visited that stricken spot and
saw the conditons himself.
In the Parish of East Feliciana.
Lousiana, In 1904 35,000 bales of cot
ton were grown. This same county
last year after the coming of the wee
vil raised only 2,830 bales of cotton.
Governor Manning and the commis
sion to inspect the boll weevil terri
tory first stopped at New Orleans.
where they were met and entertained
by the business men. Thre they stud
ied the credit side of the conditions
brought about by the ravages of the
boll weevil in the cotton districts.
The governor talked with John M.
Parker, the vice presidential nominee
on the Bull Moose ticket, and a promi
nent business man of that city. From
New Orleans the governor and his
party went to Baton Rouge where they
met the farmers and business men and
talked with them of the boll weevil
conditions. Th governor and his com
mission visited the territory where the
weevil has wrought its worst and in
terviewed the farmers and their wives.
the merchants and bankers and gath
ered first hand information about how
to meet the conditons which arise
with the coming of the weevil.
The governor found that co-opera
tion between farmers merchants and
bankers enabled the people to adjust
themselves to the new conditions and
save the country from ruin. The mer
chants there, as here, had made ad
vances on cotton but the weevils ruin
ed cotton. They called in the farmers
and told them they would co-operate
and either sink or swim together.
They made advances and the farmers
bought hogs, cattle, put In food crops
such a~s potatoes, beans. etc., increas
- ed their grain crops and made the
cattle business their principal indus
try.
By- patronizing the creameries they
soon got a good steady income from
milk. As a result while the volume of
business isi smaller it is all cash. the
credit system is a thing of the past.
Lands which decreased in value when
the weevil first came under the new
conditions are climbing back to their
original prices and the people are
thriving on diversified and intensive
farming.
Lousiana, which has grown 1,031.000
bales of, cotton dropped down low as
245,000 bales in one year but this year
will probably raise 400.000 bales. The
weevil's ravages are the worst in three
years and after that they do not seem
to do as much damage but they are
always present, once they arrive they
cannot be gotten rid of. They lay
their eggs in the cotton squares and
eat out the bolls. No cotton blooms
are. seen after August and the wel
years are the ones in which the wee*
vils get in their worst work.
In one weevil ravaged county in
Mississippi the governor found that
the farmers had turned to the cattle
industry and two creameries were
paying at the rate of $18,000 a month,
the milk furnishing the one steady
source of income for the farmers.
"Everywhere the ->eople advise us
to keep cool and by no means 1e1
our labor get away from us when the
weevil comes," said the governor. He
advises the farmers to prepare this
fall for the coming of the weevil by
economizing, increasing their grail
planting, plant more foodstuffs, gel
some hogs and cows, plant clover!
wherever oossible, and should encour
.Eve rybo
age the creameris wnerver .ob
lished and patronize the packing plant
in Orangeburg. He advises them to
plant soy beans and velvet beans.
- The cotton seed oil mills furnish a
ready market for the soy beans. which
extract the oil from them, while the
velvet beans are ;reat soil builders
and make fine feeding for stock.
"Above all, hold your labor." is the
governor's advice. He does not want
the people to become panicky but in
sists that they must prepare for the
changed conditions of disaster might
befall them.
Governor Manning picked some of
the boll weevils out of the cotton
bolls in Lousiana and brought them
back with him in alcohol. He plans
to make speeches to the farmers over
the state on this subject and will have
something to say on it in his message
to the general assembly.

GOT PRIZED STOVE
ESKIMO EARNED POSSESSION
DEAREST TO HIS HEART.
Big Steel Ship's Range Subject of His
Adoration-His Igloo Now Easily
the Warmest in All the Terri
tory of Alaska.
Penaski was an old Eskimo who
ruled in feudal fashion a little settle
ment about 30 miles away, between
our winter quarters and Port Clarence.
He had a wild yearning to possess our
stove. It was a big steel ship's range
that weighed 400 pounds, which, by in
finite labor, we had brought up the
Cruz-ga-ma-pa river by flatboat.
When you consider that the Eskimo
gets along with one fire a day in the
middle of the dirt floor of his hut,
the smoke of which goes out through
a hole in the roof, and the rest of the
time relies on hermetic sealing and
animal heat, you will see that it was a
noble and worthy desire. Further
more, Penaski knew an Eskimo down
the coast toward Nome who boasted
of owning a little cast iron heater ; he
wanted to outshine that fellow.
Penaski was rich according to his
own standards. He~ had a home-made
still made of a coal-oil can and a gun
barrel, in which he made "tunguk"
from a mash of flour or rice. That he
sold to his neighbors at a large profit.
He had four wives, a good dog team
and plenty of furs and fish.
When the end of winter drew near
the stove became an embarrassment to
us. Our claims lay 60 miles iarther
inland, and it was hard to get provi
sions in to them. If we carried our
big range over we might not be able
to take anything to cook on it. We ap
proached Pennski Ca the matter. After
some negotiation he agreed to earn
the stove by transporting seven loads
of provisions over the divide by dog
Bright and early the next morning
there wvas a howling of dogs and a
chatter of voices, and into our camp
came all the inhabitants and dogs of
the little village. They loaded up and
started, 50 poundas to the dog. The
trip was a weary one to me, but to
the Eskimos, gorg'ng on our grub, it
wa a glorious pienic. They would
travel only as fast as I would. lead.
Th' slowver we went the better they
likeu it. We bad to break trail by
slowsh'aes, and I l d the wvay.
By the second night I was worn out.
So was Pennski; but at every stop he
wud comie up and start an eager jar
gon, Ile would hold his hands five
feet apart. I would nod. Then he
wo~ld jindiate the height and breadth
of the' stove with his hands. I would
reassure himi, and he would start off
with fresh vigor.
The third day was like a nightmare
to me. I was dazed with fatigue. Ev
ery time we stopped to rest I threw

ery time we started again I moved stif
fly, like an automaton. About midday
we reached our goal, unloaded and
started back.
We returned light and quickly. On
the fourth day we pulled into camp in
the half light of midnight. Pehaski
demanded instant payment. We
dumped the fire into the snow and de
livered the goods. The Eskimo lashed
two sleds together, hitched on all the
dogs, loaded on the hot stove and
started off, howling and shouting, for
their village, 30 miles away. The last
we saw of our mammoth cooker it was
taking a flying leap down a ten-foot
bank, and dragging all the Elkimos
with it.
Alaska Joe was over that way the
next winter. He told me that Penas
ki's Igloo Is the warmest in all Alaska,
and that the Eskimo sits day and night
with his aged limbs crossed and his
rheumy eyes half shut, adoring his
stove.-Chicago News.
Desert Cisterns.
Perhaps nothing could better illus
trate the difficult nature of Persia as
regards military operations than the
knowledge of the extreme measures
that have to be adopted for the con
servation of water over a large 'part
of the region in which the Turks,
Russians and even a considerable por-']
tion of Persians are now in conflict. I
The Caspian watershed of Persia Is
fairly well watered and wooded, but I
all the region south of about the lati- 4
tude of Teheran-the central and
southern zones-are almost absolute
desert, the largest cities being near I
the base of the mountains, where the o
rivers have not had time to be ab
sorbed in the burning sands. At other
points there are occasional wells and I
springs, but the principal sources of i
water in these desert regions are the I
strange cisterns.
Stone conduits carry water from the
mountains to the cisterns on the des- I
ert plains.-Popular Science Monthly.
The Swiss Post Office. .1
The Swiss post office saves its old
stamps, and this month it offers 10,- 1
000 used copies of the current high I
value Swiss stamps, 3, 5, and 10 I
francs, for sale. Last year a similar
offer to the trade was realized. The I
three denominations are offered at I
10d per stamp in what is styled "first I
quality," and 7d per stamp in the see
ond quality, or 2s 6d and 1s 8d the i
set of three. The first quality stamps
were only used on dockets, etc., which
never left the post office; while the i
second kind were used in the mails. I
The stamps are only supplied to the I
Swiss dealers, but British dealers can
obtain them from the Swiss trade at j
a small com'missioni of these prices..
