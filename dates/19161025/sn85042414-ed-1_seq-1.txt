The Germans, who yesterday were

recapture by the French of the fort
of Douaumont and the Haudremont

mile front north of Verdun, reached
London too late for comment in the

"This strikes a severe blow at Ger

address here by Col. Theodore Roose
velt, who urged that compulsory
training would redound to the benefit
of the nation by increasing democ
racy, developing American youth phy
clally and mentally and aiding the
country's social and industrial devel
opment. His criticism of President
Wilson Included a declaration that the
executive had "exchanges offices for
political support.".
Col- Roosevelt advocated repeal of
the Hay military bill and restoration
of the militia to its former status. He
cited Switzerland's development as an
instance of what compulsory military
training would do In developing a
country "physically, mentally and
morally."
The colonel divided his speech,
which primarily was to the women of
the state, between an appeal to them
to vote for Charles E. Hughes for
president and a sharp criticism of the
administration's foreign and Mexican
policies. He declared the passage of
a constitutional amendment en
franchising women was the most
practical and expedient goal for the
suffragists now and asserted Mr.
Hughes would maintain his announc
ed stand in favor of this amendment.

ISWSTIflED
At Any Rate State Officials
Say There Will be Bal
ance of $300,000.
Statutes Evaded But Same
Result Could be Reached
by Cut in Levy.
Bismarck, N. D.. Oct. 25.—Although
the state tax commission has discov
ered a clause in the North Dakota
statutes which might nullify the re
cent action of the state board of
equalization in making a flat ten per
cent reduction on farm lands and cer
tain other clashes of property, it is
highly improbable 4hat the tax com
mission or any other agency, indi
vidual or public, jfrill endeavor to
press the advantage by asking the su
preme court to mandamus the board.
First and foremost, the reduction
in taxes is by fio means unpopular
with the class principally benefited—
the farmers. It means that their con
tribution to the expenses of operat
ing North Dakota will be cut more
than $80,000 this year, and this de
crease is very welcome in a season
when crops have not been up to the
general standard,
$800,000 (n Treasury, Anyhow.
In the second place, even If. as the
clause upon which the state tax com
mission bases its stand, would tend to
indicate, the bpard has overstepped
its authority in making a reduction
which would exceed one per cent
up­|adopted
on the whole assessed valuation of
all the property in the state, there
would seem to be no means whereby
the equalizers can be made to back
down, as, if they cannot reduce the
assessed valuation, they have abso
lute authority to decrease the levies.
Furthermore, it becomes apparent
upon going into the subject In detail,
that there is no just reason why the
North Dakota farmer should be taxed
an additional $80,000 this fail, inas
much as a balance of $800,000 over

Swings Upward.
(Herald Special Service.)
Minneapolis, Oct. 25.—December
wheat sold today at $1.96 5-8 at high
time and held the advance in the
greater part until near the close,
when it dropped to |1.91.
Flour price records for half a cen
tury were broken at ll*a. m. today
when the millers of Minneapolis an
nounced that flour in carlots, on track
in Minneapolis, was $10 a barrel.
Ten dollar flour in Minneapolis
means higher than $10 nearly every
where else in the country.
The millers based the price on
11.95 for December wheat, and a
premium of four to six cents for mill
ing grade in cash market, and accom
panied advices with the notation that
in the event of $2 being reached for
December wheat, first patent flour,
which the quotation covered, would
be $10.25.
The records of the old Philadelphia
flour exporting firm of Bell Sons &
Co., of which the father of the late
James S. Bell, president of the Wash
burn £rosby company, was a member,
show that in the period Immediately
following the close of the- civil war,
flour sold in the east at $16.a barrel.
At the time, Minneapolis flour prices
were-$12 to $14 a barrel, but the en
tire milling process has changed so
materially since then that direct com
parisons are lm possible.
In the Minneapolis wheat pit the
volume of business tri futures, con
trary to what might have been ex

great part to the refusal of commis

to be acting in behalf of Felix Diaz,
the latest pretender to the role of dic

be between Vera Cruz. Tampico and

in revolt against the first chief.

General Aguilar, a former Carranza
follower, is at the head of several
thousand troops in Jalisco, southeast
of Mexico City and west of Vera
Cruz. The Carranza forces in the
state of Oaxaca are in revolt and
ready to join the strongest movement
developed for the advance upon the
capital. General Medina Barron, one
of the staunch adherents of Diaz, has
the state of Colima under control
with a large number of troops and
equipment for an army that would
equal that of Villa before Chihuahua.
Diaz Has Large Following.
Military men who have followed
the progress of the disaffection of the
Carranza forces through secret
sources of information are of the
opinion that the greater portion of
the armed men of the country can
be swung to the support of Felix
Diaz and it would be no surprise if
he were to bring about a coup d'at
that would place him in virtual com
mand of 75,000 men, well equipped'
and with ammunition in plenty.
