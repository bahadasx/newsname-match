ADMIT LOSS Of BREMEN.
TEUTONIC DIPLOMATS VIRTUAL?
LY CONCEDE DISASTER.
Other Men haut Submarine* Will Cm
ry on Overseas Underwater Com?
merce.
Washington, Oct. 19.?Losa of tue
Gorman submarine merchantman
Bremen virtually was conceded to?
day by ranking Teutonic diplomats iu
position to be familiar with the
movement of the vessel. The Bremen
la one month overdue.
It was admitted that German offi?
cials were without information as to
the fate of the Bremen. All they
know is that she set out for America
from Bremerhaven and that she
should have arrived at an American
port soon after the middle of last
month.
The disappearance of the Bremen
will not cause abandonment of the
project to send merchant submarine?
regularly from Germany to the
United States, It was said. There ap?
peared to be reason to expecc that
another sub-sea freighter, either the
Deutschland or some other, would
reach an American port some time
within the next month.
German officials In Washington do
not believe the Bremen could ha\e
fallen Into the hands of the British
unleea t he had some accident to her
machinery. They pointed out that,
unlike naval submarines, merchant
si bmar nes avoid all localities fre?
quented by shipping and therefore are
not open to the same risks.
Reports that the Bremen had arriv?
ed safely in New London were pub?
lished In newspapers In Germany
more than two weeks ago.
The Bremen was commanded ly
Capt. Schwarkopf and carried >t
crew of approximately 25 men.
One official aald It was considered
moat likely that the Bremen had met
the fate of several naval submarines
which had never been heard from.
theljyroim hoe4 boon reported an
being In detention camps of the allies.
It la presumed that they had some
accident.
Another argument advanced in
support of this theory was that the
Bremen had aboard a number of im?
portant documents for the German
embassy here which probably would
have been made public had they
fallen Into the hands of the British.
CONFIRMS BREMEN S LOSS.
Telegram From Name City Says Mer?

London, Oct. 20.?An Exchange
Telegraph company dispatch from
Amsterdam says that a telegram re?
ceived there from Bremen confirms
the report that the German Ocean
Navigation company, has received no
newa from the commercial submarine
Bremen and that she is regarded as
lost. Great anxiety prevails among
the families of tho crew, virtually all
of whom reside in Bremen, and it is
expected difficulty will be experienced
In obtaining crewa for other commer?
cial submarines which may under?
take trans-Atlantic voyages.
According to this information, the
sailing of the Deutschland on another
voyage across the Atlantic has been
cancelled.

Germ} In Child's Disease Found;
to Come.
Baltimore. Oct. 17.?The mystf
surrounding the cause of the spl
made tonight at Johns Kopkuis hos?
pital, i
Extensive research conducted by Dr.
Horace T. Burrows, pathologist of the
hospital, has resulted In the discovery
of the infantile paralysis germ, . the
existence of whua was established
nine years ago by ur. Simon Flexner,
of the Rockefeller Institute.
According to Dr. Burrows, the dis?
ease is not spread by contagion, but
the germ is Introduced into the hu?
man system through the mouth in
milk or water.
"Always In every case of the dis?
ease a germ has been found in the big
intestine showing that the disease is
spread by* some raw food. That that
food Is milk or water is established
by the fact that babies, whose only
diet has been milk and water, died of
the disease. 1
Dr. Burrows and his assistants, un?
der the direction of Prof. Wm. H.
Welch, have been making autopsies
upon every victim of the disease since
July. They have conducted a care?
ful microscopic search.
Of the diseased organs it has been
found that the germ occurs only In
the colon. The investigations prove
that 100 per cent, are infected in the
big intestine. Since it is only possible
for the germ to enter the big intestine
by way of the mouth, food und drink
must he the carriers.
This discovery demonstrates for the
first time clearly that raw food con?
tains the germ of infantile paralysis.
he investigators are so certain
that this is true and that there is no
otl\er way for the disease to be con?
tracted that they stlggest that the
quarantine be raised against personal
contact and that all raw foods, such
as milk, waters, fruits, etc., be steri?
lized, boiled or cooked before being
given to children or others.
The investigators found that house
flies and other insects undoubtedly
help to spread the germ from one
food to another.
This discovery is the first one that
has been given out officially by Johns
Hopkins hospital before it has been
published In a recognized medical
journal.
This rule is broken for the first timo
in order to clear up the mystery sur?
rounding the disease as quickly as
possible and in order to allow the
schools to open and business to go on
as usnul.
The And was not mado by accident,
but aa a result of u palnstuklng re?
search.
The spread of the disease is so much
like that of typhoid fever and Its
methods of communication that the in?
vestigators are sure they have hit
upon a way to make an antl-pollomyc
lltls vaccine like the anti-typhoid vac?
cine that stamped out typhoid in the
United Sttues urmy.
MEXICANS FIRE ON AMERICANS
EIGHT AT SAX JOSE LASTS
FORTY-FIVE MINUTES.
According to Advices Received by
Border Commander Mexicans Were
Drunk?-No Loss of Life in Ex
hange of Shots.
Ban Antonio, Oct. 20.?American
troops and Mexicans clashed near
San Jose, in the Big Bend country,
yesterday afternoon, according to a
repor^ received by Gen. Funston early
tonight from Col. Joseph Gaston, com?
mander of the district. The fight last?
ed for forty-five minutes. No losses
were suffered by the Americans and
information is lacking regarding loss
Jatnong the Mexicans.
Col. Gaston's report said that a
I band of about thirty Mexicans opened
fire on a detachment composed of
twenty-three men of the Sixth cavalry
and Texas Guardsmen engaged in pa?
trol duty between residio and Ruid
osa. Lieut. Cardington, of the Texas
troops, in command of the detach?
ment, ordered his men to return the
fire.
A vigorous exchange of shots con?
tinued for forty-five minutes, the
Americans and Mexicans firing in
Ermish formation from covered po
ions on either side of the Rio
ande. Information from Col. Gas
Mi did not indicate that tha United
tos soldiers crossed in pursuit of
ie Mexionns. After the fight Lieut,
tdington returned to Ruldosa with
his command.
Mexicans Drunk.
Washington, Oct. 20.?Gen. Fun
Afn, reporting tonight on the ex?
change of shots across the border at
["8a n Jose, said that late reports
chins him indicated the American
ps were fired upon "by drunken
xieans."
The dispatch made no mention of
iftg by the American troops and
sajld there, were no casualties on eith
oident, believing that an irresponsible
I band had blundered upon the detach?
ment of Americans and had with?
drawn after firing a few desultory
shots. There was nothing in Gen.
Funston's dispatch, it was said, to in?
dicate a prolonged engagement.
CLAIMS RECOGNITION.
Venizelos Government Construes Let?
ter from American Consul in This
Light.
Athens, Thursday, Oct. 19?(Via
London, Oct. 20.)?The afternoon
newspapers publish a letter, said to
have been sent by the American con?
sul at Saloniki to M. Politis, foreign
minister of the provisional govern?
ment, established by former Premier
Venizelos, expressing the "sincere
hope of being able to continue with
the de facto government the cordial
relations always heretofore existing
between the authorities and the con?
sulate." \
The adherents of M. Venizelos claim
that this constitutes recogniztion of
the provisional government by the
United States. The American minis?
ter, Garrett Droppers, denies that any
consul has been authorized to do more
than cultivate essential relations with
the de facto authorities in Mytllene
and Crete as well as Saloniki.
TO BUILD NEW COTTON MILL.

wood-Grecne and a firm of Northern
capitalists and present owners of the
Winnsboro mills purchased sixty-eight
acres of land adjoining their old prop?
erty for the purpose of erecting n:i
additional mill. A corps of engineers
will shortly survey the new site, and
with their coming matters will take
on a definite outline as to the exact
date of construction. Under the su?
perintendence of J. M. Williams the
iSl
operatives have seen the benefit of his
progressive policy. The people of the
mill village have had their homes
painted, streets graded, electric lights

thing done for their comfort in a
modern way.

HARVARD PROFESSOR DEv iR
ES RUSSIA IS WILLING TO
COMBINE WITH GER?
MANY.
Japan in Alliance Also?-Such Combi?
nation Would Crush England's Am?
bition for World Power.
Cambridge, Mass., Oct. 30.?Hugo
Muensterberg, professor of psychol?
ogy at Harvard University, in an ad?
dress tonight before the International
Political Club, of the university, as?
serted that he had been reliably in?
formed that iiussia and Germany
would sign terms of a separate peace
before spring, and that after this
peace there would be an alliance be?
tween Germany, Russia and Japan.
"I know from reliable sources," he
said, "that Russia is out of joint, is
half bankrupt, is starving and will
be ready for a separate peace before
( spring. The result is to be an alll
i ance between Germany, Austria, Rus
' sla and Japan. Japan and Russia arc
J pushing toward this combination and
I an overwhelming majority of the Ger?
man people would welcome it today.
"It is the old Bi8tnarckian tradition
that Germany ought to be the friend
of Russia, and that such an alliance
would be her surest protection.
"If we really want to bring peace
tor a generation there is no hope but
to bring Germany and England to an
understanding before Germany and
Russia have made peace and formed
an alliance. Neither the English nor
the German people want this peace to?
day, but they ought to want it, for
once the new alliance is formed it
will seek to crush the ambition of
England for world power.
"Some neutral groups in Europe are
socking to bring about this under?
standing between Germany and Eng
i land. Yet real success can be expect?
ed only If the government of the
United States undertakes this master
work."
Cliaracterizcs Statement of Hughes
Too Absurd to Be Worthy of No?
tice.
Elmlra, N. Y., Oct. 20.?Newton D.
Baker, secretary of war, last night
was shown a clipping quoting him as
comparing the Mexicans with the
American revolutionists.
"It is too absurd to be worthy of
notice," he said, not concealing his
displeasure at being misquoted. "I
couldn't think of such a thing, to
say nothing of saying it. It is en?
tirely wrong. I didn't say anything
that could possibly be interpreted
that way."
SECURE INTEREST ON BAL?
ANCES.
Tuxes for Sinking Fund on Runds
Reduced One-half Per Cent.
The report of the secretary and
treasurer of the city schools publish?
ed in yesterday's Item was something
of interest to the entire community,
aa it gave a concise statement of
funds being used for school pur?
poses in the city. However, the pre?
face of the report was not published.
In this preface there are two items
which were not shown in the report
that will be .of interest.
The city this year is securing in?
terest of four per cent, on the daily
balances of school funds in the va?
rious banks, whereas heretofore it did
not secure this interest. The building
funds are also drawing Interest from
the banks at the same rate. In ad?
dition to this the rate of taxation for
a sinking fund for bonds issued has

the initiative toward that end la
voiced by the TotoglMf. The Tele
graaf says:
? "Ten days have elapsed since the
submarine war was carried to the
doors of America and nothing h:?s

that our; ships are allowed to be tor?
pedoed right on the American coast?
j We say in all frankness to America
that submarine warfare must be stop?
ped and Germany must DO told that
mistakes, which all the world know
are no mistakes, w ill no longer be tol- ;
