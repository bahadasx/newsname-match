Noted Repubican Leader Is
Greeted by Bursts of Ap­
plause During Speech
New York, Oct. 24.—Charles E.
Hughes tonight told an audience that
crowded Schuetzen Park hall in
Queensborough, that he did not want
the support "of anyone who has any
interest superior to that of the Unit
fid States, who would not instantly
champion the rights and interest of
'America against any country what­
ever, who wants immunity for foreign
aggressions, or who would have the
power of this nation held captive to
any foreign influence or swerved by
(lien machinations."
Mr. Hughes' declaration was made
at the first of three meetings at which
he spoke in Now York City tonight.
The other two meetings were held In
Harlem and in the Bronx.
Exclusive American Policy.
"It is hardly necessary to say that
if I am elected," Mr. Hughes declar­
ed, "wo shall have an exclusively Am­
erican policy in the service of Amer­
ican interest,. 1 have no secret un­
derstandings, ho unstated purpose. If
anyone supposes that in case of my
election, the right and interest of
American citizens will be subordinat­
ed to any ulterior purpose or the in­
terest of the policies of any foreign
power, whatever, he is doomed to dis­
appointment.
Free of Entaglements.
"I am an American, free and clear
of all foreign entanglements. We pro­
pose to have an administration, an
American administration, while deal­
ing with all nations on a basis fthe
most absolute fairness, will maintain
unshakingly American rights on land
and sea.
"We shall not tolerate the use of
our soil for foreign intrigue. We shall
not permit threats from any quarter
or any foreign influence to swerve us
from our action. I believe that the
great mass of American people are
sincerely patriotic.
Opposed to Government Hold-Up.
"I am opposed to government hold­
up. I am opposed to surrendering the
power of the executive or congress to
the demand of force, whether labor or
capital."
Favors Jewish Rights.
Mr. Hughes came out explicitly for
the rights of Jewish citizens of the
United States. In this regard he said:
"1 heartily endorse the following
plank in the Republican platform:
"We reiterate the unequalified ap­
proval of the action taken in Decem­
ber. 1911, by the president and con­
gress to secure with Russia as with
other countries a treaty that will rec­
ognize the absolute right of expatria­
tion and present all discrimination of
any kind between American citizens,
at iv a a
wardless of race, religion or previous
political allegiance. We renew the
pledge to observe this principle and
we unite in the cherished hope that
the war, which is now desolating the
world, may come to an end with all
due rapidity and a lasting restoration
of brotherhood among the nations of
the earth and full and equal rights be
effected.
"The settled American doctrine con­
firmed by many treaties is that when
a citizen of a foreign country for
swerves his allegiance to that country
and is naturalized here, swerving al­
legiance to the United States, he is
thenceforth to be treated throughout
the world a citizen or the United
States and his rights as such must be
respected. I agree with the declara­
tion of the Republican platform that
we should secure a treaty with Rus­
sia which will recognize the absolute
right of expatriation and prevent all
discriminations between American cit­
izens, whether native or foreign born,
and regardless of race, religion, pre­
vious political allegiance, are devoted

erty and we cannot recognize any rac­
ial or religious discrimination with
respect to the privileges of our citi­

Cut in Equalization Justified by
Governor Increase Would

COMMISSION HAS POWER
TO DECREASE ITS LEVIES
Although the state tax commission
has discovered a clause in the North
Dakota statutes which might nullify
the recent action of the state board of
equalization in making a flat 10 per
cent reduction on farm lands and cer­
tain other classes of property, it is
highly improbable that the tax com
mission or any other agency, individ­
ual or public, will endeavor to press
the advantage by asking the suproma
court to mandamus the board.
First and foremost, the reduction In
taxes is by no means unpopular with
the class principally benefited—the
farmers. It means that their contri­
bution to the expenses of operating
North Dakota will be cut more than
$80,000 this year, and this decreaso
is very welcome in a season when
crops have not been up to the gen­
eral standard.

President's
Armor-Lane
Syracuse, N. Y., Oct. 24.—With the
approach of the campaign's end, the
Republicans have failed to "find a
flaw in Woodrow Wilson's armor,"
declared Franklin K. Lane, secretary
of the interior, in an address here to­
night. When Charles Evan Hughes
was nominated, he said, he felt a bit
nervous as to the outcome of the elec­
tion, because he felt that if there had
been any great mistakes by the ad­
ministration, Mr. Hughes would re­
veal them.
"He was the Republicans' strongest
mail, and he has failed,'' the secretary
said. "The greatest men that the Re­
publican party has drawn to it, not
only Mr. Hughes, but Mr. Taft and
Mr. Roosevelt, and your own state
leader, Mr. Root, have been challeng­
ed by circumstances to prove their
right to the title of statesmen, and
each has done his best. But I ask you
what plan, what program, what pol­
icy have they presented to the Am­
erican people more -worthy, more
practical, more American, than that
which has been pursued by Mr. Wil­
son?
They have done their best, but they
have failed, not only because they
were without ability or statesmanship
or without an intense desire to serve
this country they have failed be­
cause with all their genius they could
do no better than that plain, unas­
suming gentleman, who four years ago
was in derision, called a schoolmas­
ter, but. who has now ris*n to be rec­
ognized as one of the master minds of
the world."

Chicago, Oct. 24.—Huge export sales
of wheat caused prices today to ad­
vance to an extent that made any pre­
vious quotations since the beginning
of the European war look cheap. The
market closed strong, 1% to 4%c net
higher, with December at $1.78% to
$1.79% and May at $1.78% to $1.78%.
Other leading staples, too, all scored
gains, corn,l%c to 2%c: oats $l%c to
l%c and provisions 7 to 140.
Bulges in the value of wheat were
preceded by a weak start and a ser­
ies of nervous fluctuations before the
market took the upward grade in
earnest. A big falling off in the Euro­
pean visible supply as compared with
a week ago. gave an advantage to the

ADVOCATES REPEAL OF
HAY MILITARY BILL
Denver, Oct. 24.—Pleas for univer­
sal military training and criticism of
President Wilson for 'debauchery of
the civil service," characterized the
addressed here tonight by Col. Theo.
Roosevelt, the principal one of a trio
of speeches made in the course of his
one-day stay in Denver. Col. Roose­
velt urged that compulsory training
would rebound to the benefit of the
nation by increasing democracy, de­
veloping American youth, physically
and lueritaliy, and aiding the country's
social and industrial development. His
criticism of President Wilson includ­
ed a declaration that the executive
had "exchanged offices for political
support."
Col. Roosevelt advocated repeal of
the Hay military bill, and the restora­
tion of the militia to its former status.
He cited Switzerland's development
as an instance of what compulsory
military training would do in develop­
ing a country "physically,' mentally
and morally."
Makes Appeal for Hughes.
The colonel divided his afternoon
speech, which primarily was to the
women of the state, between an ap­
peal to them to vote for Charles E.
Hughes, as president, and a sharp
criticism of the adminstration's for­
eign and Mexican policies. He declar­
ed the passage of a constitutional
amendment enfranchising women Was
the most practicable and speedy goal
for the suffragists now, and asserted
Mr. Hughes would maintain his an­
nounced stand in favor of this amend­
ment.
Late this afternoon, he spoke brief­
ly to the members of the "Hughes
Women's Special" campaign party,
which arrived late today.
"Strict Accountability."
The colonel told the women's meet­
ing that jf he had been president and
had said President Wilson's "strict
accountability" message to Germany,
"there would have been no more ships
sunk, unless there was a fight after.
The Lusitania was sunk with its 1.394
deaths as a consequence, because oth­
er nations believed as we'd welcome
being kept out of war. If I had been
president then, I'd have siezed every
German interned ship, and would have
said to Germany, 'Now, we'll see not
what you are going to give us as com­
pensation for this, hot what, we are
going to give you.'

the fact that world supply totals show­
ed for the first three months some­
thing of a decrease. Nevertheless, no
unusual upward leap in prices took
place, until word came that export
business of the day would aggregate
as much as 2,500,000 bushels.
Highest quotations of the season
quickly followed not only for wheat,
but also for the entire grain list.
Corn borrowed most of its strength
from wheat. Country offerings of new
corn were larger, but it was feared
that rains would delay the'movement.
Oats advanced in sympathy with oth­
er grains, and because of big export
sales. The amount of oats taken to­
day by Europe was estimated at 1,000,
000 bushels.
