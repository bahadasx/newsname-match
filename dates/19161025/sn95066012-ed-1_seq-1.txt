PETROSRAD ADMITS REVERSE
: : A .
German Commander in Control of
Railroad From Danube to the
Sea.
Berlin, Oct. ' 25 Cernovaila lias
been captured 'by tlie forces of Field
Marshal von Mackensen, the war office
announced today. The capture of the
Important railway point is considered
of far more consequence than the tak
ing of the Rumanian seaport of
Caranzita three days ago.
Petrograd, Oct. 25. The Russo-Ru-manian
forces have abandoned the
bridge over the Danube at Cernovada
and have retired northward, the war
office announced today.
London, Oct. 24. Field Marshal von
Mackensen's army ' of Bulgarians,
Turks and Germans has tightened Its
crin on the railroad which links Ru
mania to the sea. From the Danube
to Constanzt. Rumania's only itnpor
tant seaport, the line is In control of
the German commander.
He does not hold the entire stretch
of track. But he followed his capture
of the port yesterday by taking Med-
Jidie today and by capturing Rasnova
which 18 not on tne ranroau, uui is ou
the Danube not far southwest of Cerna
vnda where the line crosses that
stream on the only bridge which spans
it. So the line no longer is useful to
the defenders of Dobrudja.
Furthermore, his troops on his ex
treme rlsht are pursuing the retreat
Jng Russians and Rumanians, who
have fallen back sixteen miles from
Constanzt, to Tzara Murat, which is
northwest of the port. Capture of
fe.700 Rumanian prisoners is an
nouncd. Nor are the Rumanians faring much
better in the Transyvanlan Alps.
They are offering more stubborn resis
tance there, it is true, but the Aus
trian and German troops continue to
move slowly through the mountain
passes. Berlin announced today the
capture of Predeal, a Rumanian town,
with 600 prisoners.
VERMONT IS HEALTHY
Infantile Paralysis Only Serious
Affliction Present.
Burlineton. Oct. 23. "Vermont is
pretty healthy at present',' says Dr. C.
F. Dalton. Secretary of the State
Boari of Health. "Aside from the 30
or mo-e cases of infantile paralysis
and son diphtheria, measlees and
whooping' cough everybody is well.
The opening of schoools this fall
failed to disclose any great trouble
among the pupils aside from the usual
colds which in. the larger schools, at
least are being well taken care of by
medical inspectors and teachers co
operating with parents of the child
ren. "But 60 cases ol measles were re
ported in Vermont during September
two in Burlington among them. Of
whooping cough there were 125 cases,
mostly mild. This is 'some' different
from the measle epidemic which came
to Mils city just before the close of
schools last spring and continued
the gtnater part of the summer."
A report from MaBsachusette State
Health Department came to the desk
of Dr. Dal'on this morning giving
figures on iiifantile paralysis in that
state. F"rom January to October 15,
the total number 0f cases was 1015.
The disease Is well scattered in
Massachusetts.
A meeting of the Burlington Board
of Health was held ltt evening when
matters of 'interest regarding the
work of the board wer discussed.
The new garbage collector jv h. Mc
Cale, has nine men and as many
teams collecting throughout the city,
the material being hauled to 1,9 farm
in Colchester by automobile truck
nearly five miles away which is sreat
ly appreciated, according to members
of the Board.

FRANCE
REJOICING
OVER VICTORY
AT
Territory Lost in Two Months Fight
ing Regained in Short Battle
PRISONERS NUMBER 3,500
Fort and Village of Douaumont and
Four Miles of Trenches
Captured.
Paris, Oct. 24. Dramatically, the
French broke the long monotony of
deadlock at Verdun today by striking
a blow which was at once the quickest
and the most effective the Germans
have suffered on that bloodiest of the
world's battlefields.
All France is exultant tonight, ami
amazed. For .in a day Gen. Petaiu's
troops took the village and Fort of
Douaumont, the Haudroniont quarries
and penetrated the labyrinths of Ger
man trenches and dugouts, amounting
in effect to fortresses, on a front of
more than four miles and to a depth
at some points, of nearly two miles
More, than official statement adds that
pil.oners counted so far number 3,500
and the quantity of stores captured
cannot be estimated. It concludes
with the brief but significant sen
tence:
"Our losses were small."
Fresh in every Frenchman's mind is
the concentrated horror which fol
lowed the launching of thfc Crown
Prince's drive t Verdun, when men
fell on the slopes leading to Fort
Douaumont until it became recognized
as earth's greatest shambles, tier
man losses alone were put at 30,000
before the fort was won by them. It
is literally true that every yard of
advance was paid for by hundreds of
lives and days of ear splitting hell.
et in an advance which was not be
gun until almost noon the French won
back before night an area which they
were forced to yield only after two
months of mauling. Today's gain cor
responds almost exactly to ail the
French lost in the spring.

FOR FLETCHER'S
C ASTO R I A
ALL MILLS LOSE GOODS-
Petty
Pilfering Hits
Extent.
all to Some
In connection with the stealing of
goods from the Bottum & Torrance
factory it is now believed that the pil
fering has been going on for years in
a small way and that some of the
goods have been peddled out locally to
people who would be much surprised
to 'be charged with receiving stolen
goods.
One local mill man told a Banner re
porter last night that practically all
mills sufier from this sort of petty
stealing to a greater or less extent.
People who buy mill products except
through the mill office should make
certain that the goods have not been
stolen by some one who has access to
the mill.
In the case at the Bottum & Tor
rance factory it Is now believed that
Viault was the. principal offender.
Clark Is thought to have taken things
only when he was intoxicated and car
rled them to his boarding place al
Fred Kendall's.
Mrs. Kendall supposed that the
things were stolen and urged him to
take them back and failing to induce
him to do so planned to take them
back herself, but did not quite get her
courage up to the point of doing so be
fore the case was discovered.
HALL IS LOCKED UP
North Bennington Fire Officers Have
Resigned.
In view of the fact that the foreman
and the assistant foreman of our vil
lage Fire Engine Co., have resigned
and now for over a month no action
has been taken by the company to
appoint new officers, and no interest is
shown in any way by the company in
regard to this matter: that the village
hall is frequently left with the doors
unlocked and quite often even open,
and complaints are continually coming
to the trustees that the place is used
as a rendezvous for dunks, who are
non members of the company and in
many cases not even citizens of our
villages, we have decided in order to
protect and safeguard the village
property to lock up the village hall.
The key will be left with the Stark
Paper Co., so that in case of fire those
members of the fire company who are
so disposed, and citizens who volun
teer may readily get out and use the
fire fighting apparatus.
It is to be hoped that the fire com
pany will wake up and appoint new
officers and take some Interest in this
matter. With the present apathy of
the company we are far worse off than
wo would be if we had no fire company
ut all, for then we might, before it was
too late, fully realize how helpless we
are in cuse of fire. The trustees earn
estly hope that the company will
speedily elect new officers to whom
our village hall can be entrusted, and
action will be taken so that we may
have some adequate protection in case
of fire.

HOTEL COMPLETELY DESTROYED
Loss of $40,000 on Hotel While tho
Judkins Bjock Was Badly
Damaged.
Northfield, Oct. 24. Mrs. Emma,
Benjamin of Boston, was burned to
death and property valued at more
tiian $40,000 was destroyed by fire
which was discovered about 3 o'clock
this morning In the Northfield house,
the blaze being stopped in the Judkins
block adjoining the hotel. It was ru
mored this morning that a man was al
so missing, but he was later found in
Montpelier. Gallant work by the vol
unteer fire department aided by a
heavy water pressure saved the North
field Savings bank block.
Larry Burns was rescued from a per
ilous position by the firemen. As
he was attempting to go through a
window the sash fell on his hands and
he was suspended in the air until the
firemen could place a ladder and re
moved him.
The fire apparently started in the
kitchen, athough the cause is not
know. The wooden hotel, three stor
ies in height, was built many years
ago and the flames spread with great
rapidity, the whole Interior appearing
to be ablaze when the firemen ar
rived.
There were about 30 persons in the
building at the time and it was at first
reported that several of these were
missing. The body of Mrs. Benjamin,
who had a room on the third floor.
was found in the iron work of her bed
in the cellar. It Is thought sire suffo
cated. Mrs. Benjamin's home was in Bos
ton, but she came to Northfield last
spring to visit, stopping at the hotel.
She lived with a daughter near Bos
ton, who is the wife of a Harvard pro
fessor. She was a sister of James and
Henry Clough of Northfield.
, Practically all of the persons in the
building were obliged to leave in their
night clothing, the temperature being
below the freezing- point, but they
were soon cared for at nearby stores.
The loss on the hotel is placed at
$25,000 while that on the Judkins
block will probably reach $8000.
Property valued at $150,000 was en
dangered, including State Tax Com
missioner Plumley's office. The rec
ords of this and the bank were moved
out but the fire department put out
the fire before it crossed the hallway
in the Judkins block. The loss Is
partly covered by insurance.
