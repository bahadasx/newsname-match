The following letter from Mm. Rosa
Pickett Mctlnwell, daughter of MM
Into llr Thomas R. I'ickett, appeared
In the editorial page of yesterday
morning's Lexington Herald:
Kdltor of The Herald:
My Hear Sir I hope a few lines
from an ex Kcntuckian, who is still
heart and aoul a Kentuckian, will not
be considered presumptuous, or In the
popular language of the day, "butt inn
In."
It has always been a p.'t belief ot
nilno. that the women of Kentucky
would eventually llfet the dear old
State out of the slough of machine and
partisan politics. Her officeholders,
both State and Federal, with very few
exceptions, have shown themselves to
be divided into three classes hay
seeds, fat-heads and villains.
They have blocked every effort n
the part of earnest, Intelligent and
high minded women to uplift tho State.
Judge of my surprise to read In your
highly valued publication, that ion
prominent women of Fayette county
had united themselves Into a league
to aid and abet these political trick
sters and mediocrities, to re-elect a
man to guide our national affairs
whose only consistent policy is "sofst)
first."
Never was there an administration
so lucking In patriotism, brains and or
dinary common sense. Our prosperity
is not caused by a wise legislation, but
is the result of our enormous export
to the nntlons at war. The number Of
lives lost in our pitiful attempt to kece
the peace (?) with Mexico is greater
than the total casualties of the WSf
with Spain, and has cost hundred! ol
i: illions of dollars.
The Germans hate us. The French
ri p ron eh us sorrowfully and the H: it -Ish
sneer at us. We, who live or travel
in other lands and can see our beloved
country from a distance realize only
too well the prestige she has lost dur
ing the present administration. If the
Daughters of the American Revolution
and other patriotic societies real',
honor und glorify the spirit of 76,
(the pioneer elixir which made us n
nation), they could never advocate th
re-election of Wood row Wilson.
May the shades of the old lighters
of King's Mountain. Point I'leasanl
Blue Licks, Bryan Station, River liai
son and River Thames rise up on All
Hallowe'en Kve and remind their
daughters that this country was not
built by men who practiced "watchful
waiting'' or who believed In turning
the other cheek or peace at any price
even if some of them were "good I'res
l t. rians."
Very sincerely,
ROSA I'ICKETT McDOWKLL.
