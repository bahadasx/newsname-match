HOME DESTROYED BY FIRE
NEAR LITTLE MARAIS
The homte of Mike Thormey, of
Little Marais, was destroyed by fire
rerecently. The family resided on
the shore of Lake Superior, about
two miles from Little Marais,
There are two girls age 11 and 9
and a boy age 8. The forest fire
swept down on them and destroyed
their house and chicken coop. All
the chickens were cremated, and all
their fishing nets were destroyed.
The horse and cow saved themselves,
but all the hay which was stored to
keep them through the winter was
destroyed. The children were saved
by their father who carried them to
the lake and poured water on their
burning clothes. The family saved
nothing in the way of food and ex­
tra clothing.
The loss of the fishing nets was a
particularly hard one, as the best
fishing season is now on, and the
fishermen make their year's profits
during the fall months.
Nothing could be more appealing
than the plight of a family sudden­
ly left homeless, without food or
clothing or means of earning their
living, on the bleak shores of Lake
Superior with winter rapidly ap­
proaching.
The Duluth Herald has started
a subscription list to suply the im­
mediate needs of the family and they
will make an effort to rush fishing
equipment to him from Duluth.
G. F. Lundquist left last week for
Duluth to submit to an operation.
He will return this evening as it was
found necessary to postpone the op­
eration about two weeks when he
will return to Duluth.
The town of Maple Hill will ex­
pend about $25,000.00 next season in
road and bridge building. About
$20,000.00 will be expended on the
Gunflint road, work on same now be­
ing done by a small crew of men
under foreman Matt Lanktree, the
work to be done this fall to consist
of clearing of right of way and pre­
paring for the work for next year.
A bridge across the Devil's Track
river on the east side will be con­
structed, same to be concrete ac­
cording to present plans. This will
be a part of the Gunflint road. An­
other bridge will be constructed a
cross the Brule river, the crossing
to be at a point just below the join­
ing of the North and South Brule
branches.
To the ladies and Literary Society
on Maple Hill undersigned wishes to
bring a hearty thanks for the pe­
cuniary assistance of $11.16, which
was raised on Saturday night of last
week.In that ther were appoint­
ments for me to fill at Hovland
Sunday morning, it was not possible
for me to respond to the invitation,
or to relish the eatables at your
supper. However I assure you that
the returns of the evening meal are
appreciated. It is not uncommon
to find cases like my own among
students, namely that one's capital
is a minus quantity. But my dear
friends of all the good jokes that
have been played on me the one in
connection with act is as good as
any. For I recall that on the even­
ing of Ost. 15th you had me make
announce what was to take place
which resulted on a surprise on me.
Your kind deed will long be remem­
bered.
Have you tried it?
Your humble friend

COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
MEETING SATURDAY
Chairman of The Town Boards of
County Meet in Joint Session
With County Board.
On last Saturday the county com
misioners met at the court house
and transacted considerable impor­
tant business. Road work for the
next year was laid out and includes
the building of a new road from the
Village of Grand Marais to Good
Harbor Hill, bridges across Kimball
creek Durfee creek, Dry creek, and
Reservation river.
The Gunflint road'from our village
limits to Gunflint lake was desig­
nated a state road and as such a
bout $20,000 will be expended on it
next season, the money having been
provided by the town of Maple Hill
which has been bonded for that pur­
pose.
A joint session was held with the
chairmen of the different town
boards of the county, the keeping
open of the shore road during the
winter by snowplowing being one of
the subjects discussed
SINGULAR THINGS IN PLURAL
We'll begin with a box and the
plural is boxes.
But the plural of ox should be oxen,
not oxes.
Then one fowl is goose, but two are
called geese.
Yet the plural of moose should ne­
ver be meese.
You may find a lone mouse or whole|
lot of mice
But the plural of house is houses,'
not hice.
If the plural of man is called men,
Why shouldn't the plural of pan be
called, pen?
The cow in the plural may be co\ps
or kine,
But a bow, if repeated, is never
called bine.
And the plural' of vow is vows, not
vine
And I speak of foot, and you shpw
me your feet,
And I give you a boot, would a pair?
be called beet.
If one is a tooth and a whole set
are teeth.
Why should'nt the plural of booth
be called beeth?
If the singular's this and the plural
is these,
Should the plural of kiss be nick­
named keese?
Then one may be that, and three
would be those,
Yet hat in the plural would never be
hose,
And the plural of cat is cats, not
cose.
We speak of a brother and also of
brethern.
But though we say mothers, we ne­
ver say methren.
The masculine pronouns are he, his
and him
But imagine the feminine she, shis
and shim.
So the English, I think you all will
agree,
Is the most wonderful language you
ever did see.
AMENDMENT NO 1 IS A
BUSINESS PROPOSITION
Amendment No. 1, to be submitted
at the November election, is a busi­
ness proposition for the State of
Minnesota.
The state owns 2,000,000 acres of
land. In its present state the land
produces nothing. It pays no taxes
and is not being improved. When
it is sold the proceeds will go fnto
the permanent school fund there to
draw interest for the support of the
school system the land itself will go
on the tax rolls and the taxable
wealth will be increased the land
will be improved and add to the
farm production of the state.
Under Amendment No. 1, the
State will be empowered to use tem­
porarily $250,000 as a revolving fund
partially to improve the remaining
state land and make it more attrac­
tive to purchasers, the cost of im­
provements to be added to the ap­
praised minimum price of the land
and returned to the state by the
purchaser.
The amendment will permit the
state to make an investment that
promises rich returns, without a
chance of loss.
Failure to vote for an amend­
ment is the same as a vote against
it. Don't fail to vote for Amend­
ment No. 1.
Victor Johnson has added an elec­
tric lighting plant to his theatre e
quipmeijt and will hereafter furnish

COUNTY NEWSHE
ARGUMENTS FOR
AMENDMENT NO.
The latest session of the legisla­
ture of Minnesota held in 1915 pre­
pared a series of eight proposed a
mendments to the state constitution
to be submitted to the voters of the
state for ratification at the general
election to be held November 7, 1916.
To secure the adoption of any one of
the proposed amendments at the
polls it must receive a majority of
all the votes cast in the state at the
election November 7th, not a mere
majority of all the votes cast for
and against the amendment. Thus
it may be readily seen and under­
stood that the failure or neglect of
a voter to vote on a proposed a
mendment is equivalent in the result
to a vote against it.
The adoption or rejection by the
voters of the state of these proposed
constitutional amendments is a mat­
ter of much importance and conse­
quently the voters should read and
understand them before casting
their ballot for or against them in
November.
One of the most important of
these proposed constitutinoal amend­
ments is amendment No. 8, which
proposes to make the terms of office
of the judges of probate of Minneso­
ta four years instead of two years,
the length of their terms at present.
Section 7 of article 6 of the state
constitution as it reads at present
is as follows: "He (the judge of
probate) shall be elected for a term
of two years." In the proposed a
mendment the word "four" is substi­
tuted for the word "two". Amend­
ment No. 8 is the last of the series
of amendments appearing on the bal­
lot.
At the session of the Minnesota
legislature held in 1913 the terms of
the office of the county auditor,
county treasurer, sheriff, register of
deeds, county attorney, county sur­
veyor and county superintendent of
schools were extended from two year
to four years. The legislature would
have then made the terms of judges
of probate four years the same as
the terms jaf "the other -county offi­
cers, but this it-could not do, as the
office of judges of probate is a con­
stitutional office The legislature
can repeal or amend any law of its
own creation or enactment, but it
cannot repeal or amend the state
constitution or any part thereof.
That can only be done by the voters
of the state at the polls. The voters
of the state should understand this.
The voters of Minnesota are almost
unanimously in giving the judges of
probate the same tenure of office as
other county officials, but this can
only be done by the voters passing
the proposed Constitutional Amend­
ment No. 8 at the election November
7.
At the general election held in
1914 proposed amendment No. 7, the
same as proposed amendment No. 8,
was submitted to the voters for ra­
tification. The proposed amendment
was not adopted because it did not
receive a majority of all the votes
cast in the state at that election.
The total vote in 1914 for governor
was 343,255. The total vote on the
proposed amendment No. 7, was
182,580. The vote stood for the pro­
posed amendment 98,144 against the
amendment 84,438. From these fig­
ures it may be seen that 160,675 vo­
ters who cast their votes for gover­
nor in 1914, did not vote for pro­
posed constitutional amendment No.
7. The proposed amendment re­
ceived a majority of 13,708 of those
who voted on the amendment but
failed of adoption.
The voters of the state generally
concede that the office of the judge
of probate is a most important one
and that frequent changes of judges
are not for the best interests of the
public.
Miss Edith Monker has accepted
the position of Deputy County Au­
ditor tin he court house.
Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Seglem made a
trip to Carribou point on Sunday re­
turning yesterday afternoon.
M. B. Riley, of Ashland, Wis., who
in years past has been a frequent
business visitor in the village ar­
rived last week.
The Ladies Aid of the Congrega­
tional church will give a supper in
the church basement on Friday even­
ing, Nov. 3rd. A parcel sale will be
held at the same time.
On last Wednesday's boat C. C.
Bray, of Hovland, received from the
N. E. Experiment station at Duluth

champion Guernsey cow of Minneso­
ta.
JOHN DWAN BOOSTED FOR
MEMBER STATE FAIR BOARD
Vacancy Caused by Resignation of
C. P. Craig Who Was Only Man
From Northeastern Minnesota.
The Two Harbors Journal News
has the folowing on the subject:
"Mr. John Dwan, of this city, has
ben solicited by a large number of
prominent and representative people
in northeastern Minnesota to con­
sent to have his name presented as
a candidate for a position on the
State Fair Board to fill the vacancy
caused by the resignation of Mr.
Charles P. Craig, of Duluth.
Mr. Craig has ben a member of
the state fair board for a number
of years, and at present is the only
member of that body from this
part of the state, and the people
of northeastern Minnesota feel that
the man selected to fill the vacancy
should be a resident of this section
of the tate.
In commenting editorally in re­
gard to the matter the Duluth Even­
ing Herald of the 16th inst. has the
following to say:
"It is good news that the friends
of the Minnesota State Fair here­
abouts have prevailed upon John
Dwan, of Two Harbors, to accept
their support as a candidate for
member of the state fair board to
succeed Charles P. Crage. Mr.
Crage's place should be filled from
Northern Minnesota, for Mr. Crage
is a,t present the only Northern Min­
nesota member among the nine who
constitute the board, though Nor­
thern Minnesota has been of increas­
ing importance as a factor of the
fair. His place could'nt be better
filled than with Mr. Dwan. He has
been active and useful in all work
to develop the state. He is presi­
dent of the Lake County Develop­
ment Association he has been active
and effective in the work of the
Northern Minnesota Development
association form its beginning he
is one of the incorporators of the
All-Minnesota Development associa­
tion that has lately joined hands in
the work of developing the best and
utiAost of Minnesota's possibilities.
He has been one of the most active
among those who have made the ex­
cellent Lake County fair, and is now
vice-president of the Lake County
Agricultural association. The de­
mand for his selection is not confin­
ed to Duluth by any means, bat
evidences of it have come from other
parts of the state, and not from
Northern Minnesota alone. He is
the logical man. He is unusually
competent, he is widely known, and
those who attended the last annual
meeting of the state agricultural so­
ciety will all remember him for an
address of outstanding merit. North­
ern Minnesota, and particulary
Northeastern Minnesota, will, we
feel assured, find leasure in getting
behind Mr. Dwan's candidiacy to a
man
There is no man in northeastern
Minnesota who has ben a more con­
sistent booster for the agricultural
development of this section of the
state than has Mr. Dwan there is
no man in this section of the state
better posted in regard to the needs

His Recommendation
A young man found it difficult to meet the
request for a recommendation when he sought
a new position in a strange city.
Finally he thought of his bank book and at
the next interview produced the same as a re­
commendation of his thrift and industry.
The novelty of the idea linked with the
continuity of deposits shown by the book, se­
cured the position for him without further in­
quiry.
Have you a recommendation of this kind
to back you, should you lose your present po­
sition? If not, get a pass book today and de­
posit your money with
COOK COUNTY
STATE BANK
Capital and Surplus, $27,500.00
IS NOW COMPLETED
The directors of the Alger Smith
Company will arrive in this village
this afternoon for the purpose of
further considering the proposed
mill and logging railroad to be erect­
ed here. A survey has been com­
pleted from the proposed mill Site
on the west side of the bay follow­
ing the lake shore around the bluff.
It is proposed to erect a round­
house, machine shops, storage yards,
and about thirty cottages and a
boarding house for the railroad em­
ployes upon a tract of land just
west of the Bramer adition to this
village, options upon the land having
been secured by the Company.
Near the site of the old mill it is
proposed to erect a large mill, dock,
warehouse, burner and other build­
ings. The dock will be ample for
the loading of pulpwood for ship­
ment to t^he eastern market which
is now in great demand, a large a
mount of pulpwood territory being
tapped by the proposed line.
The east breakwater will have to
be moved to the angle recommen­
ded by the U. S. Engineer which
will bring the outer end of it quite
a distance south of its present po­
sition. This will be necessary for
better protection of the western
part of Grand Marais harbor as well
as for shipping in general.
It is possible that the company
will install an electric light plant
sufficient to take care of the village
in connection with the mill as the
power necessary to furnish same
will be very small in proportion to
that used by the mill. This would
fill a want in the village and would
receive a general patronage.
The citizens of this village feel
very much elated over the consider­
ation of the establishment of this
great industrial enterprise in our
village, and our united hope is that
the decision will be favorable to this
village and county.
and possibilities of northeastern
Minnesota we do not beleive that a
candidate could be selected who is
beter qualified to fill the position,
from every standpoint he has a
wide acquaintance throughout this
section of the state, (in fact the
whole state) among the men who
really do things and are connected
with important movements for the
advancement of agricultural develop­
ment. He was one of the first of
our citizens to realize and advocate
the agricultural possibilities of Lake
County was one of the organizers
of the Lake County Agricultural So­
ciety and has been an active mem­
ber of that body during its exis­
tence.
On account of the favorable action
by citizens of St. Louis County, the
sure suport which he will receive
from Lake and Cook counties, and
the fact that a man from this sec­
tion of the state will doubtless be
chosen to fill the vacancy, and the
wide acquaintance and high stand­
ing of Mr. Dwan throughout the
state, there should be no question
about his being selected to fill the
vacancy.
