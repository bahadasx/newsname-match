bounty Fairs. It is hoped the ejxniitors
will bring their exhibits to the

on "Preparedness to Live." Mr.
iailey has been teaching for more i
han a quarter of a century and
eels capable of giving the parents
ome advice on rearing their childen.
He was given close attention by
large crowd. ' , J
Anretville has one of the most
loderu-^chool buildings in the State.
The auditorium is fitted with latest
tnproved seats, and each class room
3 modern in every respect.
Much of the success of the Fair
3 due to Dr. J. A. Anderson, Presilent;
and Mrs. fe. N. McCarter, Secetary,
who were aided by a large
lumber of others in charge of the
arious departments.
There were a number of mule and
lorse colts, hogs, cows and chickens

ANTHONY CI
A NEGRO 0
LYNCHEI
1
Anthony P. Crawford, Abbeville
county's wealthiest negro, was lynched
in Abbeville Saturday afternoon
by a mob estimated at 800 to 400
I
people, who overpowered the jail
officials and took the negro from a
cell in the county jail, where he had
been placed earlier in the day by<
Sheriff R. M. Burts, following a difficulty
between Crawford and a
crowd of white men in which McKinney
Cann received a severe blow
on the head at the hands of the ne
pro.
The trouble started about 11
o'clock Saturday morning when
Crawford cursed W. D. Barksdale,
who had made an offer to'buy a load
of cotton seed from the negro. When
Crawford saw there was trohble in
store for him he called for the police
and was taken to polite headquarters
by Policeman T. H. Botts, where
he later gave bond and again walked
out in the street. By this time a
crowd had gathered in front of the
city hall and attempted to seize the
negro and give him a, whipping when
after being chased to the boiler/room
of Long's gin l^use, he struck MiKinney
Cann on the head with a
sledge hammer, inflicting what appeared
for a time to be a fatal
wound, Mr. Cann remaining unconBcious
for several hours. At
the gin house Crawford was
badly beaten up by the7 crowd and
would have been lynchod then only
for the efforts of Sheriff Burts, who
managed to temporarily pacify the
mob, which had grown to about 200
by this time, and placed the negro
in &e county jaiL
About 3 o'clock Saturday afternoon
a report was circulated that the
sheriff had planned to take ,$e negro
to Greenwood at 5 o'clock.
Within a few minutes a crowd of
SOO to 400 appeared in front of the
county jail and suddenly rushed in
on the officials, seized the keys and
dragged Crawford out into the street
where a rope was placed about his
neck. After dragging the negro
through the street a hundred yards
or more, the crowd met a negro with
a wagon load of lumber. The negro,
whose name could not be learned,
quickly abandoned his wagon at the
sight of the mob. Crawford, who was
believed by some to have been dead
by this time, was placed on the waABBEVILLE

here Tuesday afternoon, Oct 24.

morning at 10 o'clock, at the Presbyterian
church, conducted by Rev. H.
W. Pratt, and interment will be made
at Long Cane cemetery.
Mrs. Billings has been a sufferer
for many months, having had to go

twenty-five years ago from Peebles,
Ohio, and has endeared herself to a
host of Abbeville people by her kindness
of heart and was known for her
good works and chari^ble deeds and
was a consistent member of the Presbyterian
church of which she had
heen a life-lone member. A discon
solate husband and one young son,
Kempton Billings, have the sympathy
of the entire people.

over the negro's body at 6 o'clock,

(Crawford came to his death' at the
hands of parties unknown, to the
jury.
Sheriff's Statement. 1
"Last Saturday morning Anthony
Crawford had a dispute with* Mr.
W. D. Barksdale over the purchase
of some cotton seed.. The negro
used some offensive language at
the time, and this aroused several
of the citizens of Abbeville. A crowd
of them quickly gathered and began
looking for the negro. They^ chased
him down a back street and hemmed
him up near the ginnery. Crawford
picked up a sledge hammer .'<> ana
j struck one of the members of the
party, McKinney Gdnn, ^in the head
land inflicted what seemed fatal injuries.
The crowd then closed upon
ithe negro and gave him a Very severe
beatings
"I got hold of the negro aa quickly
as I could and carried him to jafl,
after some difficulty in persuading
the mob. Aa he was beaten up rather
severely and perhaps seriously,. I
called medical assistance. About 8
o'clock a crowd of some 800 or 400
people came to the jail and expressed
their determination to take the negro
from me. I did all in my power
to prevent them getting their hands
on him, but I was helpless in the
face, of the crowd.
"The mob took, the negro forcibly
from the jailor and started with him
toward the Fair Grounds, about onehalf
mile from town, where they
strung him up and riddled his body
with bullets. The negro was about
dead at the time the mob took him
from the jail, and I doubt seriously
if he waa alive when they strung him
up. The negro was beaten up very
severely by the crowd' that got hold
of him in the forenoon, and I believe
that if he had been left alone in jail
he would have died before night."

necessary to enlarge two rooms in the
graded school building. All rooms
in each building are now occupied
with classes. The library has been
fitted up for the Science Laboratory.
