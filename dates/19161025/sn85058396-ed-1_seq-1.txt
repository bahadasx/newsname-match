j Lighfeing Blow At Verdun
j Sweeps German Forces
; , Back Four and a Hall Miles
. i
The French have maintained the
important ground thoy won yesterday '.
in their coup north o Verdun, the war
; offico announced today.
Last night parts of the regained
territory which includes Fort Douau
mont and stretches along a front of
;'! more than four miles at points nearly
j two miles inside the former German
lines, were subjected to a German
'. counter attack.
The French held their ground, how
I ever, according to Paris, repulsing the
I German assaults, which were dellv
i ered in efforts to recapture the Hau
3 damont quarics, west of Douaumont,
and the Damloup batten southeast
; of Vaux. This command at Fort Dou-'-
auniont is among the prisoners taken
s by the French, which preliminary re-
port placed at 35,000 men. Fort Vaux
is still in German hands, but tho
j French lines run beyond it on both
;j sides.
V; Rain is interfering with operations
y on the Somme front Only artillery
i actions are reported in that area.
I Important Move in Balkans.
Today's French official report an-
nounces an important military move
13 in tho Balkans, where -Italian cavalry
Ifrom southern Albania has formed a
junction with cavalry and artillery
from the entente front in Macedonia.
This gives the entente an unbroken
front of 250 miles across the south
ern Balkan peninsula from Avlona, Al
bania, on the Adriatic, to the mouth
j of the Struma river, east of Saloniki,
on the Aegean coast.
j Berlin military critics point to the
capture of Predeal. reported yester
v day, as marking the loss by the Ru
.! nianians of the natural mountainous
defenses. on their Transylvanian fron
tier. This success of the Austrc-Ger-man
forces, it is commended, puts
them nearly in a position to move
down upon the Rumanian plains to
ward Bucharest, while Field Marshal
von Mackensen in Dobrudja is prcss
; ing closely upon Tchcrnavoda on the
Danube, the gateway to interior Ru
i"i mania from tho southeast.

$ 797,522 in figures given out today by
a semi-official news agency in Berlin,
I declared to have been taken from the
latest reports of the Russian central
identification bureau at Kiev.
The process of closing in on Ru
mania from both sides is being con
tinued by the armies of the central
powers. Tchcrnavoda on the Danube
; and Vulcan pass on the Transyl
' vanian border have been captured.

' hyn's forces. This pass penetrates '
j tho Transylvanian Alps half way be-j
tween tho Iron Gate of the Danube
, and Rothenthurm pa6s below Her
mannstadt. Paris, Oct. 24, 11:-15 P- m. Verdun,
long lost sight of, sprang suddenly
and unexpectedly today into the fore
front of tho public mind which ex
i cluslvely had been directed towards
V the battle on the Somme front. The
? German front on the right bank of
'A the Meuse. literally was swept away
J for a distance of four and a half miles
'( like straw before the wind.
General Neville for weeks has been
watching the German movements like
a lynx, carofully calculating tho effect
:f of every withdrawal pf troops for
i transfer to the Somme and eastern
EV fronts. At the same time he quietly
ffr madn his nrenarations and when he
I judged the Germans had weakened
' their defenses to the danger front he
i struck like lightning. The result was
I one of tho most brilliant operations
i of the campaign.
!i The Germans, who yesterday were
h pressing close upon the inner line or
t defenses at Forts Souville and Tavan-
r, nes, have now been driven beyond
U t the outer defenses of Fort Douamont-
B A Vaux line. Vaux fort remains in the
I f possession of the Germans, but the
I i French line extends beyond it on the
I north at Vaux village and Fumin wood
I i and also on the south of it at Damloup
1 1 battery and Chenois wood from botn
If of which positions it can readily bo
! attacked.
B i The French artillery preparation
I was brief but intense, and was over
t before the German commanders had
t 'i time to bring up reinforcements, oven
if they wore available. The assault-
ing French waves caught them before
( 5 the GermanB recovered from their sur-
j i priae and nwept over tronch after
j It trench, sending prisoners in all lines
to the rear.
j If French losses wore very light, it is
K helieved, even lighter than any re-
1 corded in the attacks on the Somme
p News of the success has caused
j I. tremendous public enthusiasm here
j i and this in all the greater because
of the general impression that Verdun
"I? ias over and done with and that
both sides were contenting themselves
with holding what they had won.
Today's operation, proving that the
French could Btrike a smashing blow
at Verdun while carrying on an ex
tended offensive operation on the
Somme, has greatly Increased public
confidence and has gone far to lessen
the depression caused by the loss of
Gonstanza.
Paris, Oct, 25, 5:45 a. m. The
French attack at Verdun apparently
took tho Germans completely by sur
prise and not at one point did they
succeed in stopping the impetuous
rush. In three hours the French re
captured ground, to gain which re
quired months of patient effort by the
Germans, Including such positions as
Douaumont fort and Thiaumont work,
which in the past were won and lost
repeatedly.
The official French account of the
battle, every word of which was
weighed carefully, does not say the
German line was forced back, but
that it was "burst." Later details of
the French victory shows that its
extent was as much of a surprise to
the French as It must have been to
tho Germans. General Potaine regard
ed the front cast of the Meuse as too
cramped, and suggested to General
Neville, the commander at Verdun,
that he give himself more elbow room.
With that end in view, Infantry was
sent up to reinforce the French and
artillery was ordered for the estab
lishment of new batteries. Tho avia
tion department was commissioned to
make an exhaustive survey of tho po
sitions of the German batteries and
points of assembly. This work was
carried out and the secret was kept
so well that to all appearances the
Germans never had an inkling of what
was in prospect Furthermore, they
evidently believed the energies of the
French were being absorbed by the
battle of the Somme, and made no
preparations to meet a .thrust at Ver
dun. Thus it came about that what
was intended for a small maneuver be
came a brilliant tactical success.
Four Columns Attack.
The attack was planned for ten
djyys ago. Artillery began preliminary
work, but rainy weather set in and
grand headquarters ordered a post
ponement. When the time came the
attack was delivered by four columns
of a division each, first on the left
bank on the southern slopes of Pepper
! hill and Thiaumont farm. This met
iwith little difficulty. The attackers
1 carried Thiaumont work and farm and
j the Haudremont quarries set as the
objective, and gained the Bras-Douau-I
mont road beyond. There tho attack
ers stopped, having advanced about
a mile.
i The second column was a colonial
' rllvtainn unHpr f!nlnnel Manirin from
the corps which retook Douaumont
fort last May. The task assigned to
It was to take hill 320, northeast of
Fleury, and the edge of Calllette wood.
The offensive there was even more
rapid than on the left wing. Colonel
Mangin Immediately saw he could ad
vance farther and tho commanding of
ficer was therefore Informed that
preparations had been made to con
tinue the attack. Hill 320 was rushed !
by troops from Fleury which ap
I proached Caillottc wood through the
approaches to Douaumont forL Every
where tho Germans gave way before
1 them. However, the garrison of the
I fort hurriedly prepared to defend the
! important point confided to It. French
I troops surrounded the fort and cx
1 tended their gains everywhere with-
out an instant's delay. Fatigue parties
set to work, turning the defenses so
as to be ready to resist counter at
tacks west of the fort. Tho village of
Douaumont had been carried at a run
and passed beyond. Meanwhile a stiff
struggle went on between the French
and the defenders of the fort. The
Germans refused to surrender and the
French killed nearly all of them be
fore they forced their s way in tho
ruins.
Third Column Advances.
Things went equally well on tho
right. The third column advanced
half a mile, reaching the edge of
Vaux Pond and carrying the part of
tho Vaux-Chapltre wood still held by
tho enemy and also Fumin wood. The
column stopped north of these woods
on the outskirts ot tne village or
Vaux.
Tho fourth column, which was or
dered to operate in the vicinity of
Vaux fort without taking it, followed
out the program exactly. It drove out
the Germans from Chenois and La
Feo woods,- captured Damloup battery
and pushing ahead, encircling Vaux
fort on the east, south and west, so
that the defenders hnvo no way of
Issue except to the north.
French Gains Maintained.
Paris, Oct. 25. Noon. Tho Ger
mans made a counter attack north
of Verdun last night in an effort to
regain ground won by tho French in
yesterday's assault. They attempted
to re-capture the Haudremont, quarries
and the Damloup battery. Tho war
office announces that in both cases
thoy were repulsed.
The French gains were maintained.

ITALIANS JOIN
ENTENTE FORCES
Allies Now Have Unbroken
Front Across Balkan Penin
sula to Adriatic Sea.
Paris, Oct. 25; noon. Italian cavalry
from southern Albania formed a Junc
tion yesterday with cavalry and ar
tillery from the entente forces on tho
Macedonian front, the war office an
nounced todav.
Italian forces occupied the Albanian
seaport of Avlona before Italy entered
tho war against Austria. No further
operations of conscquenco were un
dertaken by tho Italians for some time
but in the last fow months there have
been occasional reports that reinforce
ments wero being sent to Albania and
that Italian detachments wero push
ing their way eastward. Southern Al
bania is regarded by Greece as with
in its sphere of influence and towns
in this region have been under con
trol of Greek officers. The Groek rep
resentatives were required to with
draw from tho towns taken over by
,the Italians.
There has been no accurate Infor
, matlon horetoforo as to tho extent of
the Italian advance, but It Is evident
i from today's French announcement
. that this movemont, as well as tho ex
. tension westward of the Macedonian
front, has been carried forward more
, rapidly than previous advices had in
; dlcated. Tho entente allies now have
i an unbroken front across tho Balkan
peninsula from tho Aegean Bea at tho

Adriatic at Avlona, a distance of 250
miles.
