BAGLEY MURDER
CASE GIVEN TO
JURY DEFENSE
MAKES BIG PLEA
Frank Kupke, Clearwater County
Farmer, on Trial for Killing
Neighbor.
SELF-DEFENSE IS
PLEA OF ATTORNEY
Unusual Law is Quoted by 0. T.
Stenvick, Attorney for the
Defense.
(Special to the Pioneer)
Bagley, Minn., Oct. 25.A jury in
the district court at 1:30 o'clock this
afternoon was given the case of
Frank Kupke. Clearwater county far
mer, who, it is alleged, shot Joe
Vitra, his neighbor, Sept. 7, death
resulting several weeks later.
The case was tried before Judge
C. W Stanton of the district court.
It was called late Monday afternoon
and the jury was completed yester
day.
Makes Able Flea.
Attorney O. T. Stenvick for the de
fense made an able plea, asking that
the court take into consideration an
unusual law which provides as fol
lows: "It is the law that a person
in the exercise of self-defense, not
only has the right to stand his ground
to defend himself when attacked, but
may pursue his adversary until he
has secured himself from danger and
if in so doing it is necessary upon
reasonable grounds to kill his an
tagonist, the killing is excusable on
the grounds of self-defense."
Kupke and Vitra had quarreled
over some farm machinery and the
latter went to the home of his
neighbor armed with a rifle. His
manner was threatening, and Kupke
ran to the house, his wife, a cousin
of Vitra's, remaining in the yard
Glancing through a window, Kupke
claims, he saw Vitra with his rifle
barrel pointed directly at and rest
ing on Mrs. Kupke's breast. Vitra
was talking as though angered, and
realizing that his wife's life was in
danger, Kupke grabbed a shotgun and
rushed from the house.
Attemuts to Escane.
Vitra, with his rifle still resting
against the woman's breast, then at
tempted to shoot, but the bullet in
some manner became lodged in the
barrel Vitra, according to Mrs
Kupke, then turned and ran, and as
he did so, Kupke fired, the shots en
tering Kupke's legs.
Dies in Duluth Hospital.
Every care was given Vitra imme
diately and he was taken to a Duluth
hospital, where he died as a result of
blood poisoning Kupke, out on
bonds, was immediately arrested and
brought to the Beltrami county jail.
LAP0RTE SCHOOL
HOLDS FIRST FAIR
Laporte, Minn Oct 25 The first
annual school fair of the Laporte
consolidated school held in the school
house was a splendid success. A
large number of th|3 friends and par
ents of the pupils turned out from
all parts of the district, and the gar
den display both in quantity and
quality, was a surprise.
The fair was pri arily intended to
be simply an exhib of the industrial
departments and is to the credit
of Miss Idtse, Mr. Zavoral and Mr.
McNown that it was held, but its
final success is also due to the co
operation of all the teachers and
pupils.

SCHOOL BOARD TO
LEVY $50,000 FOR
NEXT YEAR ABOUT
SAMEASPASTYEAR
Levy Will Be About 27 Mills Last
Year's Levy Was 26.979
Mills.
BOARD DISCUSSES SCHOOL
NEEDS OF NEW DISTRICT
Nymore School Affairs Wound Up in
Excellent Manner Final Re
ports Made.
The tax levy for school purposes
in Bemidji will be about the same
for next year as it has been for the
past.
At a meeting of the board of edu
cation last night it was decided to
levy $50,000 for school purposes. Last
year the Bemidji district levied $42,-
000 and the Nymore district $5,000.
The increase of $3,000 will be used
to pay outstanding warrants.
The increase in valuation, however,
will keep the mill rate at about the
same as it was during the past year!
Last year 26.979 mills were levied.
This year about 27 mills will be lev
ied. The approximate valuation of
the school district, including the for
mer Nymore district, is $1,886,713.
The valuations this year over $300,-
000 above the valuations of last year,
including the reduction of ten per
cent made recently by the state tax
commission.
Discuss New School.
The board of education at the meet
ing last evening discussed the con
struction of a new school at Nymore.
Several architects will be requested
In the near future to prepare plans
for an eight-room building and if one
of the plans is accepted a bond elec-.
tion will be held for the construction*:
of that particular school.
The Nymore district is very much
in need of a new school and the
board of education is planning to
begin operations on a new school in
the spring.
The building committee of the
board was instructed to investigate
the rooms used in the Congregational
church for school purposes and to
provide for heating facilities. An ad
dition has recently been made to the
church for the Sunday school classes.
This addition will probably be used
by the Nymore school.
The clerk of the board was in
structed to advertise for 450 cords of
wood, one-half jackpine and one-half
tamarack.
The board purchased six fire ex
tinguishers of the H. W. Johns
Manville company, through the Bat
tles hardware store. Four of the ex
tinguishers will be placed in the Ny
more school and two will be placed
in the high school, in the domestic
science and sewing rooms.
Affairs Conroleted.
The affairs of the former Nymore
school have been completed in an ex
cellent manner, the clerk and treas
urer of the board having done much
work to wind up affairs.
Mrs. Bridgeman, treasurer of the
board, reported that all orders with
the exception of one small item had
been paid. The Nymore district had
a balance of $1,375.66, which was
turned over to Dr. E. H. Marcum,
treasurer of the Bemidji school board.
From this balance the salaries of
the Nymore treasurer and clerk will
be paid.
Otto Morken, clerk of the old Ny
more board, submitted a final report
and turned the Nymore records over
to the Bemidji board.
Dr. G. M. Palmer presided at the
board meeting, President Brown be
ing absent. Members present were
Dr. E. H. Marcum, ,K. Roe, J. P.

Elkdom at Beautiful Ceremony
This Afternoon.
The cornerstone of the Bemidji
Elks' new home, in course of con
struction at the corner of Beltrami
avenue and Fourth street, was laid
at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon. The
building will be dedicated to the
cause of Elkdomdedicated to char
ity, justice, benevolence and good
cheerdedicated to the benefit of
mankind.
The home, which will be completed
in the early part of next year, will
cost about $40,000 and will be a two
story structure.
Ceremonies Beautiful.
The ceremonies at the cornerstone
laying this afternoon were very beau
tiful and a hundred persons attend
ed. The Bemidji Elks paraded from
their hall to the new home.
J. M. Herbert, esquire of the
lodge, was in charge of the arrange
ments.
Exalted Ruler E. A. Barker and
E. H. Jerrard took part in the cere
monies.
Attorney E. E. McDonald in an
able address told of the organization
of the lodge, what it stands for and
what the new home means to the
city. His address in part follows:
"The order of Elks sprang from a
rather insignificant effort. The Ben
evolent and Protective Order of Elks,
recognized as one of the leading or
ganizations in our country, was born
in 1867, as the result and outgrowth
of some oppressive conditions in the
city of New York. It found its birth
place in a humble boarding house in
which a few congenial spirits were
housed. The love of liberty, and the
appreciation of good fellowship and
good cheer brought it into existence.
Suirit of Good Fellowship.
"The hearts of a few men thus
thrown together, and who founded
the order, were bound together by
this spirit of good fellowship and
friendship, and from that day to this
the prevailing, promoting and guid
ing spirit of the order are the undis
solvable bonds of friendship, the firm
resolution of each member to make
life brighter and pleasanter for oth
ers, 'ministering to the sick, reliev
ing the distressed, aiding the unfor
tunate and working together for the
common good of all mankind. The
organization is pledged to the loyalty
of its members, to our country, to
protection of the home and to love of
friends.
"When it was first organized, the
order was given another name, and
on a Sunday, Feb. 16, 1868, the pres
ent name was selected.
Spreads Far and Wide.
"Of course, an organization of this
kind with such aims, dedicated to
such work, could not but succeed.
The order spread to every American
city of any note, gathered under its
banner over three hundred thousand
members who represent the highest
and best type of American citizen
ship and manhood.
"Though not a beneficial order, it
has been said of it that it spends
more in unostentatious charity than
any other organization in the world.
"For such an organization as this,
it is proper that we construct and
maintain an appropriate home. The
foundation should be substantial and
well laid, the cornerstone carefully
and properly placed, the building
planned and constructed in keeping
with the ideals of the order, the com
fort, good fellowship and good cheer
of its members and as a credit to our
city. The plans and specifications,
the character of the work performed
and contemplated, insure this result
When constructed the order will have
a home surrounded and filled with
the atmosphere of true Elkdom This
atmosphere is filled with a loftv
spirit of loyalty to our country, of
protection to the sacred home and the
love of friends. No one can Jive
within, yes, no one can come within
this atmosphere without being a bet
ter citizen, a truer friend, a fonder
husband and father. Those who
linger in this atmosphere will be lead
in the direction of that life which
we are taught to live in order to
inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. Thus
steadily and certainly within the in
fluence of this building and our order,
will be steadily worked out the per
manent upbuilding of mankind.
Conspicuous for Charity.
"It is perhaps a violation of the
canons of .the order to even refer to
i tfty^W* &*> -rt i "A" "^p"*'
