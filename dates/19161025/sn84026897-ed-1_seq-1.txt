JOHNSTON LETTER
Lutheran Mission Conference in
Session. Death of Rev. Mr.
Bradford. New Centu
ry Club Met.
Everything this week is centered
in the annual State Convention of
the Women's Home and, Foreign
Missionary Society of the !S. C.
Southern Synod, which is in session
at the St. Johu's Lutheran church.
Delegates from all over the State
began to arrive on Saturday, and
many of the homes are filled with
these visitors, and everything is be
ing done for their pleasure and
comfort. There are about one hun
dred representatives, including some
of the ministers and speakers.
The opening service was held on
Saturday afternoon, which was a
welcome service, and later, interest
ing talks were given.
A fine program, sounding devo
tional and inspirational notes, was
entered on Saturday evening, and a
splendid address was heard. The
music of the Convention is a de
lightful feature, some of the dele
gates assisting.
On Sunday morning, the Conven
tion sermon was preached by Rev.
C. L. Brown, D. D., of Columbia,
vhich was a very fine ons, and la
ttr, dinner was served at the church
grounds. The great hospitality of
these good people was exhibited and
a long table was literally covered
with tempting viands. As so many
of the Lutheran members reside
near town, it was decided to serve
dinner all three days at the church,
so as not to consume the time, which
going to the homes would do.
During the afternoon session, it
was a great pleasure to hear a for
mer pastor of this church, Rev. P.
E. Monroe, now President of Sum
merland College. He brought greet
ings from the S. C. Syncd. Dr, R.
'"'S. Patterson gave a splendid ad
dress.
. The Young People's Rally, con
ducted by Mrs. Rygh, of Green
ville, began the evening's service
which was greatly enjoyed.
Mr. Chas. P. Barre, who is Pres
ident of the Young People's Feder
ation, gave an inspiring address on
"The Heroism of Service.".
Miss Nettie Black, of Columbia,
sweetly sang, "Thine Forever," and
Miss Ruth Etird, also of Columbia,
gave an impressive reading:, "The
Last Word." Misses Ruth and
Caro Efird sang, "My Faith Looks
Up to Thee."
The feature of the evening was
the address by the State President,
Mrs. M. 0. J. Kreps, of Columbia,
who used as her theme, "What
Shall I Render Unto Thee, Lord,
For All Thy Benefits."
Monday and Tuesday were filled
with much business pertaining *o
the welfare of this splendid State
Organization.
It was a sincere regret to the
body, that one of the speakers, Mrs.
E. C. Cronk, had to return imme
diately to her home in Columbia,
having been summoned homo on
account of a bereavement.

Witches. Ghosts and Pumpkin
Heads in the Parade.
Who would have thought it! In
this new era of autos, flying ma
chines, witches are returning to
earth, ghosts and "Pumpkin heads"
will attend the Fair.
They will not be in side shows
either, but s^me of them will ride
in the paraca a-ong with the suf
fragists and the newer types of hu
manity. They are no longer to be
delegated to the rear.
They are coming because the
fair is so near the Halloween sea
son when all these creatures return
to earth.
If any one has any appropriate
costumes for any of these visitors
or any decorations which would
suit the float in which they will
ride, or any heads for the pump
kins" send to Mrs. W. L. Duno
vant in Buncombe, who will enter
tain the visitors during the fair and
arrange for the best interests of
these important personages.
The Civic League will invite
them to dinner, the W. C. T. U.
will furnish them with plenty of
wp.ter and a place to rest, the U. D.
will present them with a cross of
honor, the suffrage League will
show them how to get the ballot
and the Daughters of the Revolu
tion will ring for them the Liberty
Bell.
All this on Thursday Nov. 2 at
the Edgefield Fair!!
Fair Enthusiasm.
At every crook and turn of our
streets buggies and automobiles
full of ladies are seen making their
way to or from committee meetings,
float meetings, automobile, rig and
trades' displays, everybody work
ing to make a splendid parade for
each day of the fair.
Wednesday, Rig day, Thursday
I Floral Parade of autos, Trade
I Displays and Floats, Friday th^
great educational day, when we are
expecting Farm Wagons and School
Floats.
An automobile party visited Tren
ton on Monday and found very
splendid feeling on the part of our
neighbors over there and they are
all interested in the great county
Fair.
In fact the people are coming
from everywhere to our Fair.
The parade is bringing the peo
ple. It is beginning to vie with
the Rose Festival of California.
At Trenton the ' people were all
interested that we talked with and
the women were all goue for deco
rations or helping with decorations
or coming over to Edgefield to help
with redding festivities.
So we are all one, and must gath
er up what remains of old Edge
field coun ty and make it the best
and most progressive in the Pal
metto State, boll weevil or no boll
weevil.
The County Fair will do it!!
Second Week of Civil Court.
The court of common pleas en
tered upon the second week Mon
day and only one case will be tried
this week, this being the suit of
W. H. Briggs against the Georgia
Carolina Power company. After
the jury was drawn for this case all
other jurors were discharged.
Mr. Briggs alleges that his farm
of 140 acres has been damaged in
the sum of ?3,200 by the impounded
water resulting from the dam con
structed across the Savannah river
by the defendant company. While
the impounded water does not touch
his property, he alleges that sanita
ry conditions have been so changed
as to produce sickness, causing suf
fering among his family and driv
ing tenants from his farra. He al
leges also that the value of his land
has been seriously affected by the
conditions resulting from the im
pounded water. It furnishes breed
ing places for mosquitoes which
have caused an epidemic of malaria.
All of the testimony was com
pleted yesterday afternoon and the
jurors will be carried in automobiles
bj the sheriff this morning to in
spect the property alleged to have
been damaged. Upon the return
of the jury argument will be made
by able counsel on both sides. This
case is attracting considerable at
tention and the outcome is eagerly
awaited.
Fresh oysters always on hand,
kept on ice. We receive a ship
ment by express every other day.

Mr. Miras: With interest we
rezCi in Augusta Chronicle October
18tli statement given out by the
Greenville News, of the endeavors
to obliterate illiteracy in South
Carbina, which said: 'In 1910 one
man in every four could not write
hie- name. " One million popula
tionjn the State, think on the con
ditions.
"Ese News again says: "The
South Carolina School Improve
ment Association has set as its
slogan by 1920, we want not one
illiterate in South Carolina." Think
ing^ the endeavors of the State,
it first involves upon our State Su
perintendent, the county Superin
tendent and the teachers, bringing
the obligation down so to speak,
almoBt individually. Are we as
parents doing what we can? Our
co-operation they must have, if suc
cess U obtained.
Some sickness in our midst, Mr.
W.A.Dow is having chills. He
borrowed them else-where.
Mrs. Frank Bussey, also Miss
McAfee our teacher, has been sick,
but she persevered in teaching last
week.
Mr. Luther Timmerman will leave
in a few days to resume his work
for Woodman of World.
Rev. Pat Bussey attended Sun
day school at his old home church,
Red Oak Gr?ve yesterday lectured
on the Sunday school lesson, and
also explained the advantages of a
"Teacher Training Class." His
talk was quite encouraging to us.
Mr. and Mrs. Miras, Miss Nannie
Whatley, also Mr. John Whitley
ofk*8?feh .Augusta called on their
i??I.%$fff.J.-, and neighbors-Mr~-and
Mr. and Mrs. J. Nick Griffie yes
terday p. m. Mr. Whatley talked
interestingly of his trip across the
Continent. We would enjoy read
ing description given in The Ad
vertiser, think he might write it
for us.
Hon. Thomas Lamb accompanied
by Bruce Timmerman and Frank
Kenrick spent last in Atlanta at
tending the fair. They report en
couragly of the livestock and ag
ricultural exhibits, which is of vi
tal importance just at the period
to the farmers, or at least should be
AU that money could do was ac
coraplished in establishing the race

It is with exceeding regret w(
learn of the ill health of Mr. W
H. Turner of your town, and w<
hope the treatment of the specialis!
will prove immediate relief and thai
his former health will return.
Grain sowing is rapidly increaa
ing, also the gardens are not at al
neglected.
When this mean war begun ano
our boys had their nerves shaken
fearing they might have to leave
"Choty" a piece off, we would ofter
think best thoughts for them, in
stead of bad, and would say "This
war may mean a blessing in dis
guise" to our people, and now, if il
shall teach us economy, has it nol
proven a blessing to all America?
More econemy, and less speed; foi
is not the death rate increasing bj
this unsafe and unnatural inventions
now in existence? Think of the
unbounded safety of the Titanic,
made thus, seemingly in defiance, of
the Ruler of the universe.

Interesting News From the

usually brings a bad spell of weath
er, rain for that days crowd, to get
clothes, shoes and hats ruined with
just as it did this time, and the cold
spell came along to make it more
miserable. There was a parade pass
ing here all day Tuesday which
continued all night long and until
12 o'clock Wednesday. Each one
whipping and driving as bard as
the poor animals could go. One
horse wagons With 8 and 9 on them

12, going at break-neck speed. Au
tomobiles also passed all during the
night. The returning poeession be
gan by 2 o'clock, and it was a con
stant stream of wagons and buggies
until ll o'clock that night. The
wind and rain increasing all the
while. We have no doubt but there
were lots of people made sick that
day. Glad we did not get started
from home before the weather came.
Some were wise enough to come
back without going in, even al
though they had tickets.
Mr. Frank Townes, Jr., attended
the Fair in Atlanta last week.
Mrs. Julia Townes has been yery
ill during the past week, but sat up

wheu we heard last from him.
Saturday was another . enjoyable
day with the Meriwether Agricul
tural Club. For they had another,
one of their noted barbecues, lhere
was quite a nice crowd out, and af
ter the business was finished the
hall was turned over to the ladies
for them to discuss the putting on
the exhibit at the fair. We did not
hear their selection of who would
be "The Boss," but heard four of
the ladies will work together, and
several of the gentlemen have prom
ised their aid. We hope all the
men of the Club will do their part
willingly and gladly and make this
a success, 'tis for a good cause. The
ladies have always helped tue men
put on every exhibit they have had
heretofore, and 'tis their duty to
show their appreciation of the la
dies aid by doing more than ever
before.

"UNCLE IV" WRITES
Gives Some Interesting Facfs
and Amusing Incidents of
the War. Mr. Scott's
Letter.
Harlem, Ga.,
R. 2, Box 111.
Oct. 21, 1916.
Dear Advertiser:-Just to let you
know tha.t I am alive, but not well.
Bul that is alright. I have waked
Hugh Scott up, and his enclosed let
ter will tpll you what was the mat
ter with him and how fast be can
run.
He speaks in his letter of Tom
Crafton (Dr. J. N. Grafton of Col
lier's father.) Yes, Tom was a
good soldier and was killed on
John's Island in August 1764, and
in the same fight, Johnnie Mays,
Bill Bolton, Mose Bruce and An
drew Bates, (a mere boy.) Jim
Taylor was also fatally wounded,
and died at a hospital in Charleston
?oon after he was carried there, Six
or seven others wounded.
Sarena Parkman, Bill Frazier,
Jim Forrest and three others whose
names I cannot just now recall,
possibly Henry or Sam Roper. Can
remember the names of the others,
md there was only 21 in the squad
that shey were killed out of, leav
ing only niue or ten unhurt.
Capt. T. H. Clark was in com
mand of the squad, and Lieut. M.
A. Markeri in command of another
squad of 21. One of the men in his
jquad was wounded.
A t times we had some fun. I
laugh as I write of the time Tom
Crafton tried to make his horse
[Tomtit) jump and run through the
tents of Co. I. He had about don ft
the job and was headed for Clark's
tent (a big wall tent.) The Capt.
caught Tomtit by the bridle and
stopped the fun. Tom Crafton and
Tomtit also stopped a fist tight be
tween the writer and Bob Grafton
(half brother of Tom.) We were
in a little A tent and had just pass
ed a blow or two, when we heard
some one say, "Come over Tomtit,"
and over went the tent. I went out
one side and Bob the other, aud
saw Tom and Tomtit making for
the Captain's tent. We forgot we
had started a fisticuff and had a big
laugh at the condition of Co. I's
tents. That was better than a fisti
cuff, don't you think?
I visited my children in Emanuel
county week before last, and ail of
them had gathered tine crops of
corn and cotton, makiug from eight
to twelve bales of cotton and from
100 to 150 bushels of corn to the
plow. While with us in McDuffie,
have made only about 4 bales of
cotton and 50 bushels of corn to the
plow, and possibly next year it may
be the reverse. We don't know,
but we dou't want them to make
less, and we hope more. We hope
that we both may make good crops
next year.
The sun does not shine every day
in the year, and if it did, we would
be that much worse off. So the
thing I think to do, is to do our
part, and not let a failure in crops
one year discourage ns. Am I
right? ' Uncle Iv.
P. S. Am writing again, but
have to be short. I send you Hugh's
letter. If you want to, j ou can put
it in print, if not, alright. I* am
still Your Old Friend,
E. G. Morgan, Sr.
Dear Uncle Iv:-I read in the
Advertiser a few days ago, asking,
"What had become of Hugh Scott?"
The inquiry|was made by you, and
I want to say to you "Thank God, 1
am still in the land of the living,
and don't need Dr. Taylor, or any
other doctor." I am getting along
towards the 74th year mark, and I
tip the scales at 143 lbs without any
coat on. I have three boys married
and can out run either one of them
50 yards at the drop of a hat, and I
will venture to say, I doubt if there
is a man in Edgefield county that
can beat me riding horseback. I
ride my mare every day, and one of
my boys will not ride her. I asked
him, "What is the trouble with
her?" She picks up her feet too
quick for me.
You intimated in your letter to
the Advertiser, that perhaps I was
in the same predicament as Sam
Roper. I will say, "No," Augusta,
Ga., bas gone dry, and it is the
first time in my life tuat I ever saw
such, but nevertheless, it is true.
You eau bar.kyour last dollar that
