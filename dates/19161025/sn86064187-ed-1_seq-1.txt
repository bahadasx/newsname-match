AMATO CANCELS
ENGAGEMENT AT
LOCAL THEATER
Singer Afraid of Infantile Pa
ralysis Situation Here.
Tasquale Atnato, Metropolitan opera
company baritone, will not appear at
the Overholser theater Friday night.
The singer's managers cancelled the
local engagement when they were made
acquainted with quarantine regulations
in the city and the fact that should an
other case of infantile paralysis break
out, theaters and schools would be
closed.
Afraid of Effect Elsewhere.
It is said that the baritone's man
ager fears that his appearance here
would affect the attendance in other
places where he is scheduled to sing.
"I am informed that the Amato en
gagement was cancelled because the
health authorities have made the an
notinrement that if another attack of
infantile paralysis develops all thra
ters will be quarantined," said Mayor
Uverholser this morning.
Wouldn't Take Chance.
"Under the present Conditions it is
Impossible to tell when such a contin
gency will arise and I presume the
singer's managers did not dsjsire to
take chance on bringing him here
and finding the doors of the opera
house closed."
It is possible that the baritone may
rnme to Oklahoma City later, though
the theater management has nothing
uenuiie rciauvc io anomer aate.

"College Hill." may be the name that
will designate trolley cars running to

In a letter to Mike Donnelly, com
missioner of accounting and finance,
Geotge W. Knox, manager of the Ok

is Imperative that the name be changed
to avoid tbA confusion that will follow
by people hoarding the "Capitol HilkV

While not enthusiastic about the

if it must be done he prefers "College

What Block In
Oklahoma City
Has Most Kids?
THERE was a children's party
in the 1200 block on West
Twenty-second street yester
day. There were eighteen children at
the urty and three others left at
home because they were not big
enough to count.
Striking a percentage from the
number of homes in the block, Ok
lahoma City would have a popula
tion of 2UI0IKI today if every block
in the city boasted as many children
under 10 years old.
The Times will award a large red
apple, the kind Colonel Harvey liked
to bet when he was editor of Har
per's weekly, to the block in Okla
homa City, that has the most chil
dren. How many in yours?
P. S Both sides of the street
on one aide of the square block
is the limit of a fair count.
"We will at least keep the 'Hill' part
of our identity," he says.
Knox asks that the new title be not
longer than the old one for the rea
son that there is not enough room mi
tl plates for a many lettered designa
tion, and that he prefers nut to use
abbreviations.
In addition to "Sotitbside" the name
mentioned by the railway company,
"Southern Heights," has been suggest
ed. The length of the last named will
probably preclude its consideration
A meeting will be held in Capitol

not open her school for the present.
Clash Reported.
Report of a clash between city and
county health authorities over the
! handling of the infantile paralysis
I quarantine 'situation has no other basis
i than the statement given out yesterday
: by Dr. A. E. Davenport, representa
tive of the slate board of hralth, to the
I effect that the McKinley school would
i be reopened immediately and the in-
formation furnished later hv Dr.
! George Hunter, city physician, that the
institution would not open, it was
learned today.
I When asked concerning the reports,
Doctor Hunter bad nothing to say con
cerning it. He said that be was too
buy looking after the health of the
' city to make any comment. Doctor
Davenport had nothing to say for pub
lication, though intimating that his au
thority in the matter took priority over
the city health department.
Menten Talks.
1 While denying that there had been
i any breach between the city and county
docors, Leo Menten, secretary of the
health department, did not hesitate to
give the department's position:
My understanding is that whrre
there is an organised board of health
in a cily of the first class, that organi
zation has absolute control of all mat-;
ters pertaining to the city's health, un
less a crisis develops and the general
health of the city is thereby jeopard
ized,
"It occurs to me that we are handling
the situation in the best possible man
ner. We have appreciated all the as
sistance given hv outsiders."
t State Officer Here.
In the city today consulting with
Doctor Davenport and I Victor Hunter,
is N. F. Hancock, representative of thei
state health commissioner's office at
Guthrie. - Hancock says that his visit
has nothing to do with the infantile
paralysis rases, that he is only making
one of his periodical trips over the
county looking after general sanitary
conditions.
Doctor Hunter declared this morn
ing there would be no change In the
orders now in forre, today. Me said
that there were no new developments.

nearly two miles inside the former

run beyond it on both sides.
Today's French official statement
announces an important move in tho,
