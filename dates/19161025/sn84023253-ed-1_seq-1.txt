UNION SERVICE
Large Audience Hears Two National
Leaders in Congregational
Work. -v-
A large audience heard the ad
dresses by Dr. H. S. Herring, seere
tary of the Congregational National
council, and Dr. H. A. Atkinson, ha
tional social service secretary, deliv.
ered at the union service of the
North and South Congregational
churches, held in the North church
Tuesday evening.
Dr. Herring spoke on, "The Spirit
ual Interpretation of the Tercenten
ary Program." In introduction he
mentioned the preparation that was
being made by the denomination
throughout the country for the car
rying out of the tercentenary program
as outlined. A program to be carried
out within five years. The plans con
sists of: A half million added to the
church membership, a recruiting to a
high standard of the ministerial and
missionary forces. The reaching of
an apportionment of $2000,000 to be
used in advancing this work, and the
creating of a pilgrim trust fund the
income from which will be used where
most needed in the interest of the de
nomination. Dr. Herring explained the early
start by showing the magnitude of the
work to be done before 1920, and
said, when the movement was planned
it was decided that to properly fulfill
the mission, the tercentenary must
needs be celebrated with deeds and
not with talk.
In his address on, "Community
Betterment," Dr. H. A.. Atkinson
showed how the life of any town is
moulded by the community spirit.
How the social atmosphere is decided
by it, and even the food eaten is de
termined by the community taste.
He also spoke in an Interesting man
ner of the ways in which health is
being treated in communities and the
development of community recreation
as undertaken by towns and cities.
In closing Dr. Atkinson pointed out
how the church in a community fos
tered this spirit and the position any
church so placed was in, to mould
and inspire it to high ideals.

UNDER THEIR AUTOMOBILE AND KILLED
Three Ladies On Back Seat Escaped
Another Anto And Machine Went Over Bank Mr. Morse Was
Weil-Known Merchant At Lyndon Young Son Left Without Father
Or Mother Double Funeral Today.
Mr. and Mrs. E. C Morse of Lyndon were killed and Miss Maude
"Wetherbee, also of Lyndon, sustained a slight concussion of the brain
which is not expected to develop . serious results, when the automobile
in which they were riding Sunday night plunged over a 15-foot em
bankment near the Cox railroad crossing between St. Johnsbury Cen
ter and Lyndon and turned bottom up.
Miss Alice Bancroft and Miss Amelia Lee of the party were
uninjured. '
The aceident occurred when Mr. Morse, who was driving the car
turned out too far to allow another car to pass. Mr. and Mrs. Morse
were pinned beneath the front seat which laid across their bodies
when aid arrived, and death is said to have been almost instantaneous.
Miss "Wetherbee and Miss Bancroft were evidently thrown clear
from the machine, while Miss Lee was imprisoned under the tonneau,
but was able to crawl out.
Mr. and Mrs. Morse were not
arrived shortly from a nearby farm and passing autos was insufficient
to lift the heavy car from off their bodies before life was extinct.
Dr. W. B. Fitch, who' was called,
arrived soon after the bodies had been
removed from under the car. Miss
Wetherbee was taken to her home in
Lyndon in his automobile where she
was found to have a slight concus
sion of the brain. Miss Lee and Miss
Bancroft . were taken to Lyndon in
George Morrill's car.
The party was returning from Ca
lais. Vt., where they had been spend
ing the day with Mrs. Morse's niec
and Miss Bancroft's brother, Mr. and
Mrs. Lewis Bancroft. "Mr. Morse
was driving," said Miss Lee in an in
terview, "and as we came over the
crossing we turned out for an
bile which was approaching. The
car swung too near the bank which
seemed to give under the weight. Mr,
Morse evidently felt the car going for
he tried to pull back into" the road;
the. next instantlwjr' were hottom. side
up.. Mr. and Mrs. Morse were pinned
down by the back of the front seat,
and she was struggling to get out
How I got out I don't know."
The bank at that spot in the road
drops away for about 15 feet, but the
car did not go to the bottom but turn
ed once, landing bottom up.
If is probable that the edge of the
bank slid as the car turned out al
most to the fence at the roadside.
The funeral of Mr. and Mrs. Morse
will be held from the Methodist Epis

Wednesday afternoon. Rev. Fred

ST. JOHNSBURY
AND JTS NEEDS
Facts Concerning Them Frankly
Given By Protestant Pastors
Participating In General Exchange
Of Pulpits
SERMON ABSTRACTS
Rev. Paul Dwight Moody Gives Three
Reasons for Spiritual Awakening,
Non-Support of Churches, Moral
Conditions and Indifference
Other Pastors' Views.
)
Facts concerning "St. Johnsbury,
and Its Needs," were frankly given
by the pastors of the Protestant
churches participating in the general
pastoral exchange Sunday morning,
The general idea held forth was that
although St. Johnsbury may be fto
worse than other towns, yet there is
an existing moral condition about
which the people have become lax.
An outline of the subject as nan
died by Rtv, Paul D. Moody at the
Union Baptist church, Rev. G. A.
Martin at the North Congregational,
Rev. F. L. Richards at the Church of
the Messiah, Rev. C. L. Eaton at Grace
Methodist Episcopal church, and Rev
F. S. Tolman at the South church, is
given in part.
Sermon By Rev. Moody
Mr. Moody said: The need of a
spiritual awakening is evidenced by
three things, the apathetic and half
hearted support given to the
churches, the moral condition in the
town and the complacency on the
part of both town and church to
both of these. The first of these, the
apathetic support given the churches
s indicated by the many who do not
ittend church, a condition for which
a great part those who do attend
. -o to blame; they do not urge at
ndance, they do not always back up
dieir profession with their lives, and
sometimes they actually disgrace the
church by their profession. The mor
al conditions in the town may be no
worse than in other places. That is
neither here nor there. The fact is
there is not a little drinking; immor
ality" and general carlessness. .The
vorst of it Is the church is too in
different to both. This is because it.
viewpoint is the viewpoint too largely
of the world, and not the viewpoint
of God. We cannot believe because
we receive honor of men the world's
point of view. There Is only one cor
rection of this and that is prayer.
Sermon By Rev. Martin
The text "O Lord, revive thy work
in the midst of the years," is a pari
of the prayer of Ilabakkuk, one ol
the minor prophets of Israel. The
need of a religious awakening in St
Johnsbury Is not based on ' the as
sumption that the people of St Johns
bury are more wicked than those of
any other town in Vermont. But
upon the conviction that the pastors
and the Christian people of the town
need a deepening of their spiritual
life and that the harvest field is
white for gathering to Christ many
new disciples. Many have drifted
away from the anchorage of Christian
faith and character and they know it
not They have lost the conscious
ness of God in life. This loss Is re
vealed in their prayer life, prayer
has become a duty and not a privi
lege. It Is revealed in their faith
life. They hav lost their grip upon
God. It is revealed in their lowering
standards of personal achievements.
in ethics and character. It is re
vealed in the apathy and indifference
with which response is made to a
call for personal service.
Never in the hlstorv of Americi
have we come to a time so fraught
with dire peril to our religious life
and institutions as this. The spirit and
temper of the age is favorable to lax
views concerning conduct, faith ideals
and character. A colorless religious
life with many is popular and fash
ionable. At a recent meeting of the
American Bankers association the
president said: "As a nation we
have grown rich, and have grown soft
and have grown fat What happens
when a nation grows rich, and fat and
soft? Decline and decay of vital
faith, of rugged convictions, of rock
ribbed character, of good morals and
of the great institutions of society.
Tests of prosperity are far greater
than tests of adversity. It Is no time
to take counsel of our fears, but to
rally all our latent powers, to chal
lenge this spirit of apostasy. To rise
from a church vision to a community
vision. To construct a program that
is big enough to enlist every disciple
with all .his resources. And to yield
ourselves to the leadership of Christ
and the power of the Holy Ghost St.
Johnsbury needs a religious awaken
ing for men and women who are liv
ing in sin. Some of this is covered
and some of it is open. St Johns
bury needs a religious awakening to
charge the atmosphere of the
churches, so that it will be easier to
do aggressive work; to deepen Chris
tian experience, to place ax new em
phasis on the fundamental things of
religion, to restore the family altar
and to bring men and women to
Christ

HOTEL BURNED
One Life Lost Lost At Northfield
$25,000 Loss In Conflagration
Which Destroyed Norhfield House
Northfield, Oct 24. One life was
lost and monetary damage of $25,000
was done this morning by a fire which
swept through the Northfield house,
a four-story ywooden structure, and
damaged the upper part of the Jud-kins-Huntley
building Just adjoining.
That the entire east side of the vil
lage square was not wiped out was
due to the heroic efforts of the North
field fire department, which worked
from 3 o'clock until 9 before the fire
was checked.
About a score of persons were it,
the hotel v building and there were
many thrilling fescues as the firemen
cl'mbed to the windows and brought
imprisoned people to the ground; and
several were more or less serloufc.y
hurt in reaching safety.
Mrs. Emma Clough Benjamin of
Northfield lost fcer life.
The fire was discovered at 8 o'clock
by James A, McMann, a clothina
de-iler here who resides in the hotel.
His room wa. on the third floir lib
was awakenfd by the crackiin-f of
flames and on looking out of the win
dow he foun.l that part of tho build
ing n lnch was used as a dining room
and kitchen to be a mass of flames.
He .hastily gathered some of his
clothing and then rushed downstairs,
giving the alarm as he went. The
fire alarm was soon rung in and the
department responded promptly.
By that time the rear of the hotel
was a roaring furnace, and the fire
men laid 2100 feet of hose and used
eight streams of water during the
strenuous fight against the . great
odds. The fire, as already stated, had
made a big start and the nature ot
the hotel construction made the
building highly irflammable. The
fire spread through the entire -jtruc-ture
most rapidly.
While some of the firemen were
directing the streams of water, others
put ladders against the building to
rescue those who were imprisoned
within. Several who had been unable
to make their way down the stair
case were carried down the ladders,
not having time either to save any of
their property. Cora Henry, vhor
was an employee of the hotel, wai
overcome by the smoke and was car
ried from her rom in the fourth
story. Lawrence Burns, who lived in
the hotel, had a most trying experi
ence as he was forced to hang by his
fingers from the window sill of his
room on the fourth floor while the
firemen were hoisting a ladder. In
addition, his torture was accentuated
by the fact that the window had slid
down and was resting on his finors
as he clung desperately to the eniall
board. Mr. Burns is a heavily built
man, weighing in the vicinty of 220
pounds.
George S. Bennett, who was occu
pying a room with Sergeant B. IS.
McMath, instructor of the Vermont
National Guard, hurt one heel se
verely as he made his way down a
fire csenpe. Others were more or less
bruised in getting out
It was not until daylight camo that
the body of Mrs. Benjamin was
found. She was 70 years of age,
whose home was in Northfield, but
who had been living in the hotel for
the past six months. Her room was
on the third floor, and the body was
discovered on the first floor, having
fallen with the ruins of the upper
part of the structure. The ren.ains
were badly burned, especially about
the head and shoulders.
The cuests of the hotel from oiit of
town, as taken from the register to
day, were: F. A. Cleveland" of Ilem
ingsford, la., Mr. and Mrs. C. A.
Cleveland of Ormstown, la., (tlie par

ton. G. Blake of Fitchburg, Ma.,
andC. E. Kompter of Wilkes-Barre,

clothing and effects. Mr. Blake, when
seen this morning, told of getting out
