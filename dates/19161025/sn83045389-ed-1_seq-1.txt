WASHINGTON, October "4.?Charges
tliiit fieneraV Carranza is preparing to
leave Mexico are being freely made by
his political opponents in Mexico City.
They are based upon his decision to
l?'av?! his capital for Queretaro and the
fact that Mrs. Carranza already has
crossed the border into the United
States, accompanied by the wife of her
husband's War Minister and chief sup- j
porter. General Obregon.
Information to this effect is reach
ing oflicials here from various reliable j
sources. So far nothing tangible tend- 1
ing to support the story has come
through otlicial channels. It is known,
however, that many ofllcials here be- |
lieve General Carranza has committed
a political blunder, at least, if he is '
not in fact preparing for night, by j
permitting his family to leave Mexico
Just at this time. The trip, they say,'
was certain to be conetrucd by his |
enemies as a confession of weakness.
I't-'itt'osi; to mo
TOt'lt OK THIS rorvritv
The purpose of the visit of Mrs. Car- ;
ranzit and Mrs. Obregon, as explained ;
at tiie Mexican embassy, is for a tour
of the United States. Word of the
arrival at the border also of Mrs.
Jacinto Trevino. wife of the military 1
commander of Chihuahua State, had
not been received to-night. It was I
pointed out, however, that Trevino has ;
been among Carranza's stanchest sup- j
porters, and that if the first chief be- i
lieved his hold on the political situa- j
tion was weakening, Trevino very 1
probably would be warned, in order '
that he might also place his family !
in safety.
Tiie State Department had not re- i
eeived word to-night that Generals
Carranza and Obrepon had left Mexico
City for Queretaro. Previous advices, !
however, said that tin- first chief would
po to that place in connection with the'

tion. for which delegates were elected I

Persistent reports that Carranza was
about to leave Mexico have been in cir
culation along the border for ' some
time, and War Department olticlals pri
vately have expressed their conviction
that the de facto government, or at
least General Carranza's personal con- I
trol of rhe political situation, .was

thought that the time tniKht come soon

intoxicating liquors as a beverage,

the approach <T the campaign's end.
the Republicans have failed to "find a
tlaw in Wood row Wilsons armor." de
clared Franklin K. Lane. Secretary of
the Interior, in an address here to
night.
When Charles E. Hughes was nom
inated. he said, he fell a bit nervous
as to the outcome, because he felt that
if there had been any great mistakes
by the administration, Mr. Hughes
would reveal them.
STRONGEST IIEPUIIMCA NS
HAVE TRIED AM) FAIMJ1>
"He was the Republicans' strongest
man. and he has failed." the secretary
said.
"The greatest men that the Repub
lican party has drawn to it, not only
Mr. Hughes, but Mr. Taft and Mr.
Roosevelt and your own State leader.
Mr. Root, have been challenged by
circumstances to prove their right to
ihe title of statesmen, and each has
done his best. But 1 ask you what
plan, what program, what policy have
they presented to the American people
more worthy, more practical, more
American than that which has been
pursued by Mr. Wilson? They have
done their best, and they have failed,
not because they were without ability
or statesmanship, or without an intense
desire t? st i ve their country; they have
failed because with all their genius
they could do no better than that plain,
unassuming gentleman who four years
ago was in derision called a school
master. but who has now risen to be
recognized as one of the master minds
of the world."
Mr. l.ane said he did not question
the right of tho Republican party to
commandeer a Justice from the Su
preme Bench, and put him at the public
service, "making him President of the
United States, if in a time of national
danger it was necessary, if he alone
could save the country."
"The Republicans talk much of
Americanism," he went on, "but this
campaign has shown that Republican
leaders do n??t understand America."
Speaking of President Wilson !?-pa
tience in bis foreign policy, he said:
"We are at peace, when, it we hail
been intemperate, we would have been
at war." and that "we have made no
friends among the belligerents because
people at war don't want judges; they
want partisans."

He added: "Perhaps you think it did
not take courage to speak the direct
word when spies lilled the country and
every mail brought threats of death
and every coward of a politician
prophesied political death. If Wood
row Wilson lives to write his auto
biography <t commits to other hands
the documentary history of his ad
ministration. the world will know that
he had nerve as well as patriotism and
good sense."
The secretary went on to say. lie
misunderstands the spirit of this coun
try who believes that by appeals, no
matter how artful or covert, to sec
tional prejudice, to religious prejudice,
to class prejudice or to race prejudice,

Because of inadequate warehouse fa

tobacco, designed solely for use in
those countries, would have been
almost a complete loss unless relief
had been given quickly. The an
nuo nee men t follows:
"The British embassy has made the
following statement in regard to
American tobacco bought by dealers
for shipment to Scandinavia, and the
Netherlands and affected by the re
strictions put into effect July 15 last:
j "'Shipment of tobacco made under
' bona title contracts entered into before

Netherlands Oversea Trust or covered
by guarantee in the case of shipments |
to Scandinavia, provided that the con
signments arc under ii direct steam- !
ship bill of lading, before August 31.
"'The British authorities regard as
most important that provision that the
uoods must have been shipped on a
through bill of lading for land and
sea carriage, or under direct ocean bill,
before August 31, and they must insist
upon its fulfillment.'
"It was at first announced as a con
cession to American tobacco interests
that tobacco bought ami paid for prior
io August -i ami shipped prior to Au
gust 31 would be allowed to go for
ward frt'o of the restrictions referred
I to above. It was fount! at once that
