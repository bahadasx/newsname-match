The colony of Germans out of j
which the Lutheran congregation I
grew came to this up-country from ;
Charleston under the direction of the '?
Cern?an Colonization Society. The j
leaders in this enterprise were Capt. |
John A. Wagener, Christopher F.
Seebn, Claus Buwlnkel, J. C. Henekel
and Jacob Schroder. Of the 37 first
settlers there is not one now living in
Walhalla. Nearly all-if not all
have passed away.
The original purchase for coloniza
tion purposes was 17,859 acres for
$27.000. The Burvey of the town was
made by Tyre B. Mauldln in 1850,
and the first house was built the
same year by D. Biemann on the site
where the old Biemann Hotel now
stands. That was a typical log
cabin. Settlers soon moved in from
Charleston and built homes along
Main street. This is a wide street
(120 feet), and at one time had
three rows of beautiful shade trees.
in 18G8 Walhalla became the
county seat of Oconee county and
settlers, other than German, moved
in.
There was no railroad In the early
days, and Anderson, S. C., Augusta
and Athens, Ga., were the nearest
markets. rho material needed from
outside sources was. therefore, not so
I easily and quickly obtained.
The first officers of the town, In
18r?6, were John H. Ostondorf, In
tendant; Henean Fajeu, Jacob
Schroder, John W. F. Thompson,
Henry Bahntge, Herman Knee and
lohn M. Hencken, Wardens. John
M. Hencken was clerk of Connell.
H. P. Thode was President of the
German Settlement Society in 1858.
Th^re were seven members of the
first Church Council in 1853, includ
ing the pastor. The following were
elected at that time: Rev. C. P. Ban
?imer, president; G. M. D. Cramer,
secretary; C. Sahl mann, treasurer;
H. C. Rochau, G. H. Korber, H. Fa
Jen. C. H. Hesse.
The members of the council in the
Lutheran church at present are:
John A. Ansel, chairman; W. D.
Lady, O. H. Schumacher, Jr., II. C.
Mclburg, elders; ll. T. Ritter, G. D.
Schumacher, R. F. Kaufmann, H. W.
Brandt, deacons.
Before the organization of the
Lutheran church, Dr. Lewis Muller,
of Charleston, visited here and per
formed pastoral duties about May,
18r,2, as thc baptismal records show.
The first pastor and organizer of
the congregation was Rev. C. F. Ban
simer.
On 'May 28, 1859, the present
church edifice was raised. Thc tim
bers used were from thc original for
est and many were taken from the
land adjoining and still owned "by
the church. Only the "best material
was used, and Inside as well as out
side, is yellow heart pine. The tim
bers seem as sound to-day as when
they were placed fifi years ago. The
framing of the church was hewn by
members, and John Kaufmann was
foreman of tho work. It is a well
proportioned church, with splendid
acoustics, and 'with a seating capac
ity sufficient for some years of future
healthy growth. The congregation has
no debts, and owns, In addition to the
church and four acres of land with it,
a parsonage in the most desirable
section of town, recently remodeled
and enlarged. They believe In the
"Gospel of Work"-.that if a man
will not work neither should he eat.
The friends who come amongst them
at this Synodicnl gathering will find
them like the faith they confess-the
simplicity of the Gospel ns it is in
Christ.
nie Transformation.
While the older Gorman people in
tho congregation naturally love the
mother tongue they generously ac
ceded to the necessity of preaching
the Gospel In the language of their
children. No other of the larger
Protestant churches in this country
has had the ponderous task of trans
planting itself into n new land and a
ndw language as has tho Lutheran
church. While this transformation

The problems of tho Lutheran
church hi Walhalla have boen like
unto those of the church in many
places; but in religion, as in the sec
ular affairs of life, what one sacrifices
for becomes dearer to him. The
Lutheran people ol' Walhalla are
loyal to (heir faith and take a great
pride in the old church, whose tower
one socs from every surrounding hill
and mountain side, directing one's
? thoughts upward, skyward.
They must have had a sense of the
fitness of things-those Connan fath

close by their Temple of Mercy and
Peace.
"Valhalla" was the Norseman's hall

of the church were German-speaking !

necessary to have a man who could I
speak both German and English. In
recent years English has been used
almost exclusively.

An Error Corrected.
lu the M not at ion given inst week
by The Courier as that of W. P. Nlm
moiis for cotton and seed at 10.it? a.
m., there was a mistake. At that
hour Mr. Nlmmons was callod at Sen
eca and asked for hin quotation. Tho
reply came back to IIB "Cotton 18c.
per pound, seed $54 |ier ton." Im
mediately on The Courier's reaching
Seneca Mr. Niminons requested us'to
give authority for the quotation, as
he had not given it. At that hour
(10.25 a. m., Wednesday, tho 18th,)
Mr. Niminons wus paying considera
bly more than our quotation for cot
ton, as the market had advanced.
We regret this error, and we are
unable to account for it. No ono at
Mr. Ni m mons' soro gave tho quota
tion, we are assured; yet we asked
the telephone central for W. P. Nlm
mons' store, got a. connection, and
of course supposed that we were re
ceiving a .direct quotation from Mr.
Nlmmons. We have not learned as
yet "who gave tho quotation.

Abbeville, Oct. 21.-Anthony
Crawford, a negro, was taken from
I the county jail hero by a crowd of
2(10 men and his body riddled with
bullets after ho was hung to a treo
this afternoon about il.30 o'clock.
The trouble began this morning
when Crawford, who ?B reputed to
have been wealthy, got. into a dispute
with one of tlie cotton seed buyers.
A crowd quickly gathered, determin
ed to punish Crawford for his rough
language, but trouble was averted
for a while by Policoman 'Botts, who
took Crawford to police headquar
ters, where he was. released on bond.
A few minutes later Crawford was
seen at a cotton gin not very far from
tho scene, and the crowd, still anx
ious to punish him, went for him.
Crawford had a sledge hammer in
his hand, with which ho struck M.il.
Cann on the head, crushing his skull
and Inflicting a very serious wound.
When the crowd finished with
Crawford it was thought he would
die. Ile was removed to the county
jail.
When lt was loamed this after
noon that he was not dead another
crowd gathered, forced tho door of
the jail and dragged Crawford to tho
edge of the town, near tho fair
grounds, where he was strung up to
a tree and Ulled with bullets.
Mr. Cann, who was struck with tho
hammer, was reported by hia brother
as resting fairly well to-night.
