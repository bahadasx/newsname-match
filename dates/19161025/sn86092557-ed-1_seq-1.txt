Is tho advance shipment of a vast In-1
vaslon of Argentlno corn products
which will bo sold In the United Stales >
In competition with American corn. ,
The invasion of Argentine corn is1
made possible because of the fact that
under tho Underwood tariff law the:
duty on corn has been removed, making
unrestricted competition possibles
It Is understood that nearly a million
bushels of Argentine corn lias already
been used in glucose.
The shipment of corn from Argentine
Into the United States ut this
time Is the more remarkable becauso
of the limited shipping facilities and
tvT the almost prohibitive ocean freight
rates. Practically all the shipping of
the country is being utilized for the
transportation of commerce between

. tlons of Europe The freight rates are
' so high that ships have been known
to pay for themselves In one voyage.

Develops 10,000 Horsepower
and Uses 200-Ton Fly
Wheel.
A giant 19,000 hocsepower gas en- :
gine with Its generator capable ot developing
1,250 kilowatts of electricity
dally, has arrived at the Hutchinson i
power plant ol the Traction company
and la tndfiv h?lno? nlnno illn noalHAti
Six weeks will be required to ereet '
and place It In operation.
The engine, made by the Bethlehem
8teel company, has been ordered for
some time but owing to the rush of
war orders by that company was not
delivered until a few dayB ago. Weeks
have ben spent In preparing the foun- ,
datlon for the new unit. 200 tons of
cement having been used in building
the support. Because of quicksand
near the site of the power plant, it
was necessary to sink concrete piers
more than fifty feet to the coal.
The new unit Is uniform with the
three already being operated by the
Traction company and Is largeT considerably
than the four units of the
Consolidation Coal copmany, operated
In the same plant. The engine Is Bet
at an angle with the walls which gives
a larger working space for repairs and
escapes the necessity for widening the
building to accommodate the length
of the unit.
An Idea of the size of the engines '
used by the Traction company for de- '
veloplng their current may be gathered
when it Is known that the fly wheel <
on the engine weighs 200 tons and Is
as high as the average two story
house. This wheel when the engine :
Is running revolves at a rate which
makes the speed of the rim travel
1.7-8 miles a minute. Or In other words 1
If It were placed on a race track It
would bowl along at almost two miles 1
a minute. This fly wheel Is construct- 1
ed entirely of high grado steel to pre
vent Its cracking from the centrlfucical
force exerted upon It.
More than five miles of copper wire
Is used in the windings for the generator,
a huge affair built by the General
Electric company. When the unit Is
assembled and the gas engine started
this generator will produce 1,250 kilo- 1
watts per hour, enough to supply a [
halt dozen ordinary sized factories.

have u difficulty in starting a puny '
automobile engine, it might be Inter '

None of the six bodies remaining In

hare yet been found by the exploring
party who bare been working since
last Thursday. The exploring party
since yesterday have traversed Main
heading A to tbe face of the south
workings where tbe men were thought
to have been. No trace of any of them
could be found.
The men are now at work exploring
the workings near Main A and it is
thought that perhaps the explosion
which may have originated in this section
of tbe mine carried the bodies
of tbe men to yet unexplored sections.
Of the ten men who were In the
mine when the explosion occurred but
four bodies have been found. These
have all been brought out and funeral
