WILL NOT SIGN
IN AGREEMENT
(Border Conference Brought
to an End Without Any
Real Understanding
CARRANZA AFRAID
OF FORMAL ORDER
Belief Held That 4e Facto
President Will Help U. S.
Hunt Down Bandits
Washington, D.. Cr, May 12-—
Secretary Baker announced after
today's cabinet meeting that no
change In the Mexican policy had
been decided upon. No new orders
fer militia organizations to go to
the border were In contemplation,
he said, and Indicated that no gen
eral Intervention In Mexico was
being thought of at present.
Washington, D. 0., May 12.—Upon
receiving word today from Maj. Gen.
Hugh L. Scott that the border confer
ences with Oen. Obregon had been
closed without agreement, Secretary
Baker announced that he had directed
Gen. Scott to return to Washington
and Gen. Funston to return to his
headquarters at San Antonio, Tez.
Gen. Scott's report which was in
amplification of the official statement
Issued by the conferees at B1 Paso
last night was transmitted to Secre
tary Lansing and also was considered
at the cabinet meeting. Its contents
were not disclosed but there were
-some indications of an unwritten
agreement having been formulated to
cover co-operative action along the bor
der for the present
Secretary Baker said the conferees
tried to reach a basis for a written
agreement but found it Impossible, al
though all Interchanges were of the
most friendly character,
i. Carranza Afraid.
It was suggested that Gen. Carranza,
faced by the political situation in Mex
ico, was unwilling to make any written
agreement to which his opponents
-could point as indicating a surrender
of sovereign rights. Under that theory,
f^Gen. Obregon, it is understood, has
htfeiven assurances that every possible
lyne&ns will be employed by his govern-
u.|nent
to aid In the speedy extermina­
tion of the bandits while the formal
diplomatic discussion of the with
drawal suggestion proceeds. It is pos
sible that neither side will endeavor
,, to force the negotiations while the dis
turbed condition along the border con
•, tinues.
Before going to the cabinet meeting,
Secretary Baker said no steps to send
additional national guardsmen or reg
ulars to the border were in immediate
contemplation. It was made plain,
however, that should Gen. Fuston again
find his border guard too thin to pro
tect American towns and ranches,
there would be no hesitation in calling
out more state troops. So far, how
ever, it was said, not even preliminary
steps In this direction have been taken.
Gen. Funston returns to San Antonio
with his original orders altered in no
way. He has full authority to dispose
his men either in Mexico or along the
border.
MEXICANS MOVE TROOPS.
El Paso, Texas, May 12. —Juan N.
Amador, subsecretary of foreign af
fairs of the de facto government, who
participated in the conference with
Gen. Obregon, called on Gen. Scott to
day and reiterated to him that such
troop dispositions as were necessary
to restore and maintain order along
the northern frontier already had been
ordered.
Gen. Obregon, who will remain for a
few days at Chihuahua, has directed
Gen. Trevino to send into the states of
Chihuahua and Co
abulia ten thousand
men. These forces will be taken from
Torreon, Sair Pedro and other points
in the southern part of Coahuila. Tin
vino's headquarters will be in Chihua
hua City, Chihuahua.
Immediate occupation of the district
about Parral has been ordered and
what the Mexicans regard as an ade
quate force will be dispatched to the
Big Bend country and evefy effort
made to run down the bandits and res
cue J. Deemer, who was captured in
the Glenn Springs and Boqulllas raid.
Mr. Amador expected to leave to
night for Mexloo City where he will
have an important role as subseoretary
of foreign affairs in the negotiations
that have reverted to the foreign offi
cers of the two governments. To
newspaper men he insisted he had no
floubt of an early and amicable adjust
ment.
Mr. Amador made it clear that Gen
erals Scott and Funston had reiterated
the assertions of the administration
that it was not the intention of the U.
B. government to keep the troops in
Mexico indefinitely and that therefore
he did not attach so much importance
to this as had been given to it in Bome
suarters.

STJ1E TROOPS TO
BE DRILLED FOR
FIELD SERVICE
MtLITIA OF BORDER STATES NOT
TO BE GIVEN IMMEDIATE
WORK OF GUARDING.
San Antonio, Tex., May 12.—The
company of coast artillery from Gal
veston passed through San Antonio
this morning on its way to Marathon
to strengthen the base of the second
punitive expedition in Mexico. Ten
other coast artillery companies or
dered out for border service have left
for Ft. Sam Houston, where they will
go into camp with the militia subject
to the further orders of Gen. Funston.
With the mobilization of the Texas
militia virtually completed the next
step will be to muster in the troops
and then put them through a course
of training better to fit the organiza
tions for field work.
Now that the conference in El Paso
has been terminated, Gen. Funston is
expected to return to headquarters
immediately.
Unless action is forced by the Mexi
cans, the American army will make
no forward move while negotiations
between Washington and Mexico Olty
are being conducted. Active prepara
tions along the Arizona-New Mexico
Texas border will be made, however,
and Gen. Funston expects to strength
en all border points that might be ob
jectives of raiding parties at the ear
liest date. The fresh regular troops
will be distributed along the border
almost immediately after their arriv
al at their temporary stations, but
some time will pass before the militia
will be utilized. The guardsmen from
the three states are being mobilized at
Douglas, Columbus and San Antonio,
where they will be mustered into ser
vice and drilled for field service^
HORSES ARE SECURED.
Springfield, 111., May 12.—Arrange
ments made by Adjt. Gen. Frank
Dickson some time ago for supplying
horses for the Illinois national guard
in event of a possible mobilization
still are effective and if the first cav
alry, I. N. G., is called out by the fed
eral government these horses can be
secured by the state.
"Our plans for a mobilization of the
state troops are complete except for
the name of the president and the
date and blank lines have been left
for that purpose," said Gen. Dickson
today. "I can state positively that
if we are asked by the federal gov
ernment we can get mounts for the
first cavalry and such other troops
as may be required to be mounted."
COWBOYS VOLUNTEER.
Helena, Mont., May 12.—One hun
dred cowboys of Montana have offered
their services to the local U. S. re
cruiting office for war with Mexico, it
was announced today. A cowboy dele
gate who made the offer to the army
officers here said a thousand range
men could be secured in ten days.
BOY-ED IS GIVEN
RECALLED ATTACHE DECORATED
FOR HIS ACTIVITIES IN
1
AMERICA.
London, May 12.—A Central News
dispatch from Amsterdam says that
Capt. Karl Boy-Ed, formerly German
naval attache at Washington, has been
decorated with the order of the Red
Eagle, third class, with swords, by the
emperor.
Capt. Boy-Ed was appointed to the
Washington embassy December, 1911.
After various charges had been made
against him in regard to his connec
tion with passport frauds, the equip
ment of German commerce raiders
from the country and German in
trigues in Mexico, President Wilson
requested his recall. After the presi
dent had declined a request from Ber
lin to explain the reasons for the de
mand for Capt. Boy-Ed's recall, the
attache was ordered home last De
cember.
The charges against Capt. Boy-Ed
continued after his departure from
this country. In March of this year,
when Horse von der Goltz was arrest
ed in New York in connection with the
plot to blow up the Welland canal in
Canada, he made a statement to the
U. S. district attorney charging that
Capt. Boy-Ed had proposed an inva
sion of Canada from this country.
GAS KILLS GIRL.
Des Moines, May 12.—Heart trouble,
brought about by gas from a stove,
the vents of which had been left open,
today is believed by coroner's physi
cians to have caused the death of
Catherine Teager, 18, socially prom
inent here and a daughter of a former
Des Moines chief of police. Miss
Yeager's body was found in the kitch
en of her home late yesterday. The
coroner stated there was no ground
for the belief that she committed sui
cide.

Tucson, Ariz., May 12. —Mexican
bandits are reported to have raided
Polaris, a mining camp, seven miles
below Lochlel, on the border yester
day, driving out the Americans, who
escaped to Nogales in automobiles.
Col. Sage, commanding at Nogales,
sent a company of infantry and twen

PURSUING BANDITS.
Washington, D. C., May 12.—The

Glenn Springs and Boqulllas, Tex.
EXPEDITION RETREATING.
Columbus, N. M., May 12.—Reports
unverified at military headquarters
that American troops are being with
drawn from San Antonio, Mexico, and
other advanced bases gave rise today
to a belief in some quarters that de
velopments look toward a protective
patrol of northern .Chihuahua.
Supporting this contention is the
transportation of supplies which had
been concentrated at San Antonio,
back seventy miles to Namiquipa. It
is known also that Gen. Frederick
Funston has expressed his belief that
the present line of communication is
too long to be maintained properly.
Final arrangements for the concen
tration of the New Mexico national
guard were completed here today. The
first companies probably will arrive
from Deming and Silver City before
night. With the announcement that
the militia is to be brought to war
strength for the mobilization, Capt.
James Walsh, chief of ordnance of
the base, has prepared the additional
equipment necessary.
AMERICANS HELD

The United Engineering works has
taken the matter up with the navy
department.

REVOLT BROUGHT
ABOUT BY SECRET
ORDER OF BRITAIN
IRI8H PUBLICATION IN AMERICA
BARES DETAILS OF RECENT
TROUBLE.
San Francisco, May 12.—"The Lead
er," an Irish publication here, prints
today a purported copy of & document
alleged to have been Issued secretly
by the British government and the dis
covery of which is said to have pre
cipitated the recent revolution In Ire
land.
According to "The Leader," the doc
ument fell into the hands of Tom
Kelly, a Dublin alderman, who read It
at a special meeting of the city cor
poration the Wednesday preceding the
riots. The exposure of the govern
ment's plan'of preparedness, accord
ing to "The Leader," was the signal
for the uprising.
The document, according to the al
leged copy, had "the sanction of the
Irish office on the recommendation of
the general office commanding the
forces in Ireland."*
It directs that on receipt of an or
der issued from the chief secretary's
office, Dublin castle, and signed by the
undersecretary and the general offi
cer, certain measures be put In force
immediately.
These measures Included the arrest
of all members of the Sinn Fein na
tional council, the central executive
Sinn Fein volunteers, general coun
cil, Irish Sinn Fein volunteers, county
board, Irish Sinn Fein volunteers, ex
ecutive committee, national volun
teers and the Coisde Gnotha commit
tee. Gaelic league.
The alleged document directed that
the Dublin metropolitan police and
royal Irish constabulary forces in Dub
lin be confined to barracks that pro
vision be made to notify inhabitants
to remain indoors "until such time as
competent military authority may
otherwise direct or permit," and gave
directions for military occupation of
certain premises throughout the city.
ASQUITH IN IRELAND.
Dublin, May 12.—Premier Asquith
arrived in Dublin today and was taken
in an automobile to the vice regal
lodge. The premier's program for the
aay was first a conference with de
partmental chiefs and afterward con
sultation with Gen. Maxwell in regard
to the military situation which is well
in hand.
It is reported that in all likelihood
a proclamation will be issued shortly
abolishing martial law, the provisions
of which have been greatly modified
in the last few days.
The situation in some parts of the
provinces is said to be still rather dis
turbed and It is likely that military
control will continue in these districts
for some time longer.
Premier Asquith intended also to
meet several civilian deputations so
as to learn at first hand their ideas
concerning the reconstruction of the
destroyed portions of Dublin and per
haps to formulate a plan for compen
sation. There is relief apparent
among the population at the promised
cessation of executions which were
beginning to cause considerable agi
tation.
VALLEY IS KEY.
Paris, May 12.—Senator Berenger,
writing in today's Matin, says that the
key to the war lies in the possession
of the Briey valley between Verdun
and Metz.
"Since the war began," says Sena
tor Berenger, "France, having lost the
Briey basin, has been obliged to im
port almost all the iron required from
England and America, while Germany,
having occupied the whole Briey val
ley, is able to add 21,000,000 tons to
her own annual output. This explains
the assiduity of the Germans at Ver
dun. They want to capture the for
tress so as effectually to prevent the
French from attacking Metz."
WAR SUMMARY.
Hard fighting has been resumed in
the vicinity of Dead Man hill on the
Verdun front, the Germans making an
other attempt to dislodge the French
from the hill, the capture of which on
May 10 was reported by the Paris war
office. Two attacks last night were
repulsed by the French, the war office
announced today.
Increase in the Violence of the artil
lery fire in other sectors of the Verdun
front is reported, the region especially
subjected to the shelling being be
tween Dead Man hill and the Avocourt
wood, to the southwest. In the Dou
aumont-Vaux district, east of the
Meuse, the bombardment Is being con
tinued.
On the eastern front the Russians
and Germans are engaged in artillery
duels at various points and the same
conditions prevail along the Italian
Austrian front.
In the Caucasus region around ML
Kope the Turks claim to have driven
the Russians from positions about nine
miles in extent and foroed them to re
treat eastward.
British Premier Asquith has gone to
Dublin to study the situation caused
by the Irish revolt. The British house
of commons last night passed a reso
lution expressing dissatisfaction with
the administration of Irish affairs.

Had it not been for th6 proximity of
