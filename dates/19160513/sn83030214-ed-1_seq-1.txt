A few weeks ago Krnest Sexauer. of

OFFICERS ASSAIL
DANIELS ORDER
Reducing Number of Ships
in Commission Called
Inefficiency.
tTrr-m Tra Trltiur.a Biraau 1
Washington, May 12. -To get officers
..:..l men for the tiiree new dread?
noughts, N'evada, oklahoma and Penn
sylvanla, Secretary I'aninJs ordered
to-day that six battleships be placed in
reserve with 40 per cent complementa.
Although several other reasons were
assigned for the order, Rear Admiral
Henson, fhief of .N'aval Operatlons, ad
mitted thut need of men for the new
ships was the real one.
The additlon of three ships to the
navy this spring, therefore, results in
reducing the number of battlet.hips in
commission by three. When the Ari?
zona is commissioned next fall it will
probably be necessary to place other
vessels in reserve to get a tomplement
for her.
The six battleships put on the reserve
list are the Connecticut, Louisiana,
N'ew Jersey, Virginia, Rhodo island
and Wabyaaha. All are of tbe r-econd
line, or pre-dreadnought type.
Would Require Militia.
Under the navy regulations vessel.
in rc.erve are required to bc in readi
ness on t4-.o to four days' notiee. There
i.a, however, no way of placing the six
battleships again in commission with?
out calling on the naval militia to make
up th-- iull complenient.
Admirnl Henson said to-day that the
six battleships would be used for the
naval militia cruises this summer, 40
per cent of the crew being regular
navy men and 60 per cent militia. He
added that they might be kept in re?
serve indetinitely as a rendezvous for
the militia in case of 4\ar.
Some of the men gained by retiring
thc six ships will be used to place a
division of six destroycrs in full com?
mission. These have been operating
with reduced eomplements.
To-day's orders bring the number of
battleships in re?cr.e up to tifteen, in?
cluding one dreadnough*. the North
I'akota. There are nir.eteen destroy
ers operating with reduced eomple?
ments ar.d r-i'A ifl reserve.
Shortage Win ( ontinue.
Secretary Daniels has in.rcn<.ed his

Washington, May 12. The Admin
: iatration will take na further action
, against Great Britain's interference
with neutral commerce while Ger
many's implied threata stand, Secre
| tary of .^tate Lansing announeed to
[ day. The President reaenta Berlin's
'] attempt to place him ln an embarraae
! ing posltion.
Germany'a apparent threat to reaume
illegal submarine operationa unleas
! concessions were obUlned alao from
Great Britain has made it imposelble
lor the President to aend another note
'. to London without appearing to truckle
I to Germany.
Mr. Lansing authorized the followlng
statement:
'in view of the apparent eondltions
.ontained in the German noto lt ia
very difficult for this government to
proceed against Great Britain until the
eonditiona are removed."
L-B'ats Action to Decide.
Germanv's abandonment of the threat
t, feeommence illogal operatione, lt
iwas derla.ed, could be known only
through "observetion of the conduct of
German bubmarines." President Wil?
aon will take no action against Great
iintain until he is satistied by Ger
ir.ariy's adherence to the new aubmarine
pledgcs that the German government
doea r.ot intend to avail itself of the
"coffMa liberty of decision" reserved
in ti' recent note.
Herw long tl.c President will consider
,t necessary to wait for this evidence
is not etated. It is asaumed that it will
hr weeka, if r.ot months.
Simultaneously with thia announee
ment of policy toward Great Britain,
Secretary Lansing said that .Mr. Gerard
had heen asked to ascerUin what pun?
ishment was inflicted on the comman
der of the submarine that attacked the
Sussex. He haa been instmcted not to
make an offieial inquiry, but to obtain
the information informally. Thia
method leaves the Administration free
to abandon the question if it finds the
German government unwilling to di
vulge the faeta.
l.ermany to Blame.
fhe I'resident is believed to be con
vinced that any action directed against
Great Britain now would be construed
as an attempt to curry favor in Berlin,
a suspicion that he is most anxious to
avoid. Hia aupporters aay that Ger?
many has only herself to blame for
the inevitable consequences of the con
ditions laid down in l.er last note.
In German quartcrs here there waa
little *urpri*e and scarcely any reuent
ment at the announeed policy of the
Administration.
"We never expected anything would
be done to Great Britain," it was said.
"Aa it makes little difference to Ger?
many how many notes Preaident Wil?
son sends to London. to-day's an
nouncement really meana nothing to
u*"
Germans here say that only two
cour.es open to thia government would
iifTect the Britiah blockade- an em
bargo on arms shipments, which would
quickly bring the Alliea to terms, or
actual war. Eor more than a year
Germanv has realixed that neither of
these step* would be taken. and ia
therefore resigned to what^ia regarded
as "American unneutrality." _

Washington, May 12.?The fact that the Pershing expe

'agreement, actually is moving toward the border, is regarded
here as a sure sign that intervention will be avoidcd.
The War Department announeed to-day that General
Pershing waa gradually withdrawing his force.-; from th^ ad

i Mexico, and soon would move his base from Xamiquipa to Co
lonia Dublan, 100 miles from the border.
Pending new orders from tho President, it was plain at the
War Department that General Pershing's expedition would re
