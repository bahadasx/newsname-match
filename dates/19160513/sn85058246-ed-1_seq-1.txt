I HAVE SIGNED I
r CONTRACT FOR
SUGARJACTORY
John A. Hendrlekion'a View of tho
Preent Sugar Factory
l Controversy
J .
Sugar Is king, and Judging from
tlLe present activity not only In
tho price of the article itself, and su
gar stocks, It is likely to remain so
for somo time. in Cache county
another phaso of tho question Is oit
In real earnest, and It heglns to look
(as though wo are to lrave two now
. sugar factories. Recently the Amal
gamated Sugar Company announced
a new factory for tho west side, and
now our fellow townsman John A.
I Hcndrlckson breaks silence nnd tells
us all about a new factory that ho
and Influential and wealthy associ
ates havo decided to build. In dis
cussing tho matter Mr. Hendrlckson
submitted tho following:
"Tho people of West Cacho havo
recently been made to bellovo In
the saying "that blessings Hko ad
versities como In streaks." For a
long tlmo they havo been praying
for a sugar factory without being
ablo to reach a listening ear. Tho
Amalgamated Sugar Company havo
sovornl times been approached by
tho Trenton peoplo with the request
that a factory bo built west of the
Hear river, but their pleadings havo
always fallen on deaf ears.
"About two months ago largo land
owners of tho west bIcIo took tho
matter up with mo. I at onco con
ferred with Salt Lako essoclatcs who
took tho matter under advisement
and after looking into the situation,
wo all concluded, that West Cacho I
was an ideal location for another
sugar factory. Tho question natur-j
ally aroso whether tho farmers would ,
S ralso tho necessary beet ncreago '
and this was answered by a canvnss
made by Abraham Jorgenson and
Charles Wood among tho farmers,
who secured tho signatures of farm
ers, promising to ralso over 4000
ncres for tho years 1917-1918-1919.
Tho assuranco was also given that
nt least 1000 nnd possibly 2000 addl-"
tional acres could bo secured when '
Nowton and Clnrkston and other
parts wcro canvassed.
' When this was done, tho mutter
of securing tho construction of a
factory was taken up with builders
of sugar factories nnd nn agreement
was entered Into for a factory of
COO tons dally capacity to bo erected
In tlmo for tho 1917 beet crop. When
officers of tho Amalgamated .Sugar
Company at Ogden, heard of this re
cent move, thoy Immediately took
steps to Intervene and post hasto
sent Joseph 8cowcroft, Fred Taylor
nnj Merrill Nlbley, to Logan. Ilorej
wero ro-lnforcod with Mrtrlner Ecclesi
nnd then rushed to Trenton and held'
a meeting with about 25 farmers at
tho homo of P. P. IHngham and
thoro promised tho Trenton peoplo
that they would build a sugar fac
tory and also a railroad if they
would conflno themselves nnd their
interests to them.
Wo had promised tho peoplo that
tho factory should bo an independ
ent ono and that tho factory should
bo an Independent ono nnd that tho
beet raisers of that Bectlon, ns well
ns others In Cneho who' might deslro
to Invest, should havo tho prlvllcgo
of taking stock In tho new enter
prlso, At tho meeting above mentioned,
tho question wan put to tho Amal
gamated Sugar Company If tho peo
plo might havo tho prlvllcgo of sub
scribing stock and thoy woro told
that this would not be permitted, hu
I thoy could of course, buy BUgar stock
I on tho open markot If they cared to
I invest. Thoy further promised that
l if it was necessary thoy would put
JM t up n bond of $250,000 Insuring tho
T establishment of tho factory. '
Tho Trenton farmers woro very
much nstonlshcd nt this sudden
movo, but thoy realized that thora
was something bnck of tho wholo
proceedings that had been tho cause
of such sudden action and kindly
promises.
Wo are not and woro not at nil an
tagonistic to tho other Utnh compa
nies, but woro simply complying with
tho request nnd wishes of tho peoplo
of tho West Cacho district.
Tho dlfforonco between tho two In
tenets socma to bo simply this:
Wo took hold of tho matter In the
first plnco by request and because
wo bollevod the location Ideal nnd
tho Investment one of the safest that
can bo made.
Among those who nro associated
with Mr. Hendrlckson in tho enter
prlso are, George T. Odeli of the
Farmors & Stockgrowcrs Hank;
John Dern and W. W. Armstrong of
tho Copper National nankj John C.
Sharp of the Desoret National nank;
O. Q. Wright of tho Con. Wagon &
Machlno Co., and (probably) Jesse
Knight of Provo. Tho above with J.
A. Hendrlckson, havo subscribed
$150,000 of tho stock and proposo
that tho farmers of Trenton, who will
ralso the beets nnd who mny wish
to subacrlbo for stock and others of
Cacho Valley, shall be given tho prl
vllcgo of subscribing at least $100,
000 Of tho proposed capital.
Tho nbovo people do not object,
In fact aro perfectly willing that tho
Utah-Idaho and tho Amalgamated
Sugar Companies shall havo tho oth-
ei $V0)0O, making up tho capital
of 1500,000. Tho proposition offer
ed to the Trenton people by the
Amalgamated Sugar Company was
simply that tho Amalgamated Would
build a sugar factory and own the
stock and the people of that section
wero to raise tho beets. Inasmuch
ns the farmers who raise tho beets
nro really tho ones who aro respon
sible for tho profits to tho sugar
company, wo feel It is only proper
and right that tho beet raisers who
have a llttlo money to Invest shall
bo given the prlvllcgo of participat
ing In tho profits.
Now that the tlmo has come when
tho tariff question Is undoubtedly
sottlod for a period of five years and
sugar stock unquestionably will for
n long tlmo remain sufficiently high
to cnablo a factory to pay for Itself
two or three times In the course of
four or five years, the ordinary man
who mny have haved a little cash Is
not now given an opportunity to In
I vest his earnings In a snfo enter
prise which he tnkes part In building
up by these largo sugar Interests.
i Wo need only to refer to tho Inci
dent connected with tho Layton fac
tory located between Ogdcn and Salt
Lake. This was promoted by In
vlduals who proposed to build the
fartory outside of any connection
with tho present companies.
Tho other companies, however re
allrcd It would take from them about
2000 acres of beets, and they felt
thoy wero entitled to participate In
tho stock holdings. Tho matter was
accordingly settled by tho Utnh Idaho
Company subscribing $100,000, Iho
Amalgamated $100,000, and tho
Church $50,000. The remnlnlng
$250,000 wns taken by individual sub
rcrlptlon. Only 2500 ncres of beets
wcro raised laBt year, but the factory
did well and tho stock cnnnot bo
bought today from any source for
less than $175 per share.
My Salt Lako and other associates
aro practically all stockholders In
tho Amalgamated and Utah-Idaho
Sugar Companies, nnd nro not un
friendly to them, but Insist that
whllo thoy are willing that theso
companies shnl hold not over 50 per
cent of tho stock, tho bnlanco shall
bo distributed among tho peoplo of
Cncho Valley who may want to he
come Interested themselves. The
contract for tho building of tho fac
tory Is entored Into, 4000 acres of
beets have been promised nnd addi
tional ncreago will be aHked for.
Subscription llHts will now bo open
ed In Logan, Smlthlleld, Trenton.
Nowton and Clnrkston ami nil who
wish to subscrlbo to tho stock will
ho given nn opportunity, up to an
amount round about $100,000. Tho
contract for tho building of tho fac
tory Is signed up and 10 per cent of
tho subscription will hnvo to lis paid
on or beforo tho 15th of Juno. 75
per cent will bo divided Into eight
payments ranging along tho porlpd
of construction which will bo be
tween August 1 this year, and Octo
ber 1 next year. Tho remaining 15
per cent Is to bo paid 30 days after
tho factory. Is completed, in running
order, and accepted.
