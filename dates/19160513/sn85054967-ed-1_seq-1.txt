WASHINGTON, May 11.—
Administration officials today
were hopeful that Gen. Obregon,
Carranza war minister, would
sign immediately the military
agreement presented at El Paso
by Gens. Scott and Funston, Qn
behalf of the United States.
Despite the long delay of Ob
regon, it was pointed out that
Gen. Scott had made no report
indicating the agreement might
not be signed.
Consequently officials were
not inclined to believe that the
negotiations would reach the
point where a break would oc
cur between Mexico and the
United States.
jury were as follows:
First, that a competent fire
boss be engaged to perform his
duties as required by law.
Second, that lock safety or
electric lamps be used in all
parts of the mine.
Third, that suitable explosives
recommended by proper author
ities be used, the shots to be
tamped with clay or other non

shot to be ignited by competent
employes with an electric bat

Fourth, that due care be exer
cised in the use of electric lines

Straw Hat Season
• Is Almost at Hand
Few More Days of Sunshine
Will Bring Out the New
Headgear.
\
A few more days of the
brand of weather handed out
in this section since the open
ing of May will see the blos
soming of the 1916 straw hat
season in Indiana.
Unhampered by an "official"
straw hat day, this town goes
blithely along from year to year,
the date of the appearance of
straws depending entirely upon
weather conditions. Other plac
es may abide by the convention
al rule that May 15 is the prop
er day for the initial appear
ance of the straw, but Indiana
folks prefer to leave it to the
weatherman.
Straws will be very largely
worn this summer, accord ng to
local hatters. The new styles
for youths are the creased
crown, Alpine shapes, with
wide brims, very similar to the
prevailing soft headgear. These
are in Milans, Panamas and
Duam-Panamas. For the older
folk there is the same idea—
the Alpine crown with pencil
curl brim and the same crown
with snap brim to be worn pull
ed down over the eyes.
Dealers expect a large sale in
Leghorn straw hats. These are
of a straw, a very light tan in
color, which has been much us
ed in ladies' hats, and which
comes from Italy. The Bang
kok in featherweight is anoth
er novelty.
There is a circle locally that
observes May 15 as official open
ing day, but tomorrow, May 14,
will see a great many of them
sporting the summer headgear*
