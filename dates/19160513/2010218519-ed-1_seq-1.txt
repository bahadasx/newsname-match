Five and fifty years

a rebellion most alarm

four years. The world
looking on said: "The

power, no cohesion, no

back those determined
men who have deter-
mined upon a new ad-

of the governed is but
a fair-weather league;
it cannot meet and turn

L-ACOB E. BAMBERGER was born at Eberstadt, near Darmstadt, Germany, March 7, 1852.
Coming to the United States at the age of thirteen he located first at Pleasant Hill,
W m, Missouri, where with his elder brothers, Simon and Herman, ho engaged in the mer
" cantile business.
He left there in 1873 coming west and engaging in similar business along the line of the Union
Pacific railroad, reaching this oity in 1875.
Forty years ago he accepted a clerkship in the Salt Lake post office, but the mining business
had a fascination for him from the first, and as soon as he was able he began making mining in
vestments. He was successful from the first and was prominently identified with various mining
undertakings in the early days of the industry of this state, and when the Centennial Eureka Min
ing company wajs organized he became vice-president, and retained the position until the sale of
the property to the United States Smelting company.
With H. G. McMillan he organized the Bamberger-McMillan company, the firm, being represent
atives of the Philadelphia Smelting company and later the American Smelting & Refining company,
holding most of the ore contracts in the state.
With his associates he purchased the control, and became president, of the Daly-West Mining
company in 1900 buying the property which has since been a great producer from the Haggin

ing to turn the whole '
laud into chaos. M
Such of the very chief- M
est of the leaders who M
had awakened the storm H
as had not been killed f
in battle were made jH
captive and the resent-
ment against them had
been accentuated by H
the assassination of the M
man whose genius had M
steadied the nation M
through its long night M
of storm. Some of these H
leaders were imprison- H
ed for a brief time M
while the waves that
the great blast of war M
had awakened were
running down, but that M
was the extreme of 'H
their punishment. H
There was not one 7
execution for treason,
no lasting attainder fl
of citizenship. H
On the first Memorial M
Day the blue and the fl
gray met and without
discrimination dressed M
alike the graves of their M
dead with flowers.
When another war ''l
came, side by side un- l
der the old flag they i
and their children fl
fought. H
The wise men of M
England should get that
history and read it care- M
fully now, before pro- M
ceeding with any more M
trials of Irishmen for H
rebelling against the H
empire. The Irish spirit H
is not broken by vlo- M
lence. M
Along all England's H
"far-flung battle line," H
in the most dangerous M
and conspicuous posi- M
tions are Irishmen. It
has been that way H
through a long past. ; H
The man most trusted H
of the English armies is H
an Irishman. It was so H
when Napoleon threat- M
ened invasion a luin- ;H
dred years ago. Look H
over the list of names H
of those who are hold- j H
ing the British flag on i H
the front and it will be JH
seen that a mighty ra- IjH
tio of the names of 1H
both officers and pri- M
vates are Irish names. j
