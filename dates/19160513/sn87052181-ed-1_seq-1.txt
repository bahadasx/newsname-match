"Our hope Is that te stato finances will

Columbia bankers until tho legislature
meets In January. If Columbia bank

way by which these borrowed funds

taking some risk; thoy aro at tho
mercy of futuro legislatures.
"I would emphasize that this trou
blo is not the fault of the university,
as many people will think when they
learn of tho shortage of funds. It is
not because a legislature was stingy,
but rather because It was extravagant,

KAISER'S REPLY
AN EVA
PRESIDENT WILSON'S NOTE ON
SUBMARINE ISSUE STILL
UNANSWERED.
ADMITS TORPEDOING SUSSEX
Urges U. S. to Insist on Great Britain
Living Up to Rules of Interna,
tlonal Law Makes Some
Ungracious Concessions.
Washington, D. C After waiting
Bovoral weeks for tho Kaiser's reply
to President Wilson's last note on the
Bubmarluo Issue, tho following docu
ment waB handed to Ambassador Ge
rard on tho afternoon of May 4:
"Tho undersigned, on behalf of the
Imperial German government, has tho
honor to pro3ent to his excellency,
tho ambassador of tho United States,
Mr. James W. Gerard, tho following
reply to tho note of April 20 regard
ing tho conduct of German submarine
warfare. Tho German government
handed over to tho proper naval auth
orities, for early investigation, tho
evidence concerning the Sussex, as
communicated by the govomment of
tho United States. Judging by tho
results that tho Investigation has
hitherto yielded, tho German govern
ment is alive to tho possibility that
tho ship mentioned In tho note of
April 10 as having been torpedoed by
a Gorman submarine is actually iden
tical with tho Sussex.
"Tho German government begs to
reserve further communication on tho
matter until certain polnt3 are ascer
tained, which are of decisive import
ance for establishing tho facts of tho
case. Should it turn out that tho
commander was wrong in assuming
tho vessel to bo a man-of-war, tho
Gorman government will not fall to
draw the consequences resulting
therefrom.
"In connection with tho caso of
tho Sussex, tho government of tho
United States mado a series of state
ments, tho gist of which Is tho as
sertion tjiat tho incident is to bo con
sidered but one lnstanco of a dellbcr
ate method of indlscrlmlnato destruc
tion of vessels of nil sorts, nationali
ties and destinations by Gorman sub
marine commanders.
Repudiates American Assertion.
"Tho Gorman government must
emphatically ropudlato tho assertion.
Tho German government, however,
thinks it of llttlo avail to enter Into
details In the present stago of affairs,
more particularly as tho government
of tho United States omitted to sub
stantiate tho assertion by reference
to concrete facts.
"The German government will only
stato that It has imposed far-reaching
restraints upon tho use of tho sub
marine weapon, solely In considera
tion of neutrals interests. In splto of
tho fact that tho restrictions aro nec
essarily of advantage to Germany's
enemies. No such consideration has
over been Bbown neutrals by GGreat
Britain and her allies.
"The German submarino forces
havo had, In fact, orders to conduct
tho submarino warfare in accordance
with tho general principles of visit
nd search and tho destruction of
merchant vessels recognized by Inter
national law, tho sole exception brt
Ing the conduct of warfare against
enemy trade carried on enemy freight
ehlps encountered in tho war zone
surrounding Groat Britain. With re
gard to theso no assauranco3 havo
been given to tho government of tho
United States. No such assurances
are contained in tho declaration of
Fob. 8, 1916.
"Tho German government cannot
admit any doubt that these ordrs
wero given or are executed in good
faith. Errors actually occurred. Thoy
can, In no kind of warfare, bo avoided
altogether. Allowances must bo mado
In tho conduct of naval warfaro
against an enemy resorting to all
kinds of ruses, whether permissible or
illicit.
"But npart from the possibility of
errors, naval warfare, Just like war
faro on land, Implies unavoidable dan
gers for neutral persons and goods
entering tho fighting zone. Even in
cases whero tho naval action is con
fined to ordinary forms of cruiser war
fare, noutral persons and gocds re
peatedly como to grief.
"The German government has re
peatedly and explicitly pointed out
tho dangors from mines that hso
led to the loss of numerous ships.
Offers Further Concession.
'Tho German government has made
several proposals to tho government
of tho United States In order to re
duce to a minimum for American
travelers and goods tho inherent dan
gers of naval warfare. Unfortunately,
the government of tho United States
decided not to accept tho proposals.
Had it accepted, tho government of
tho United States would havo been
Instrumental in preventing tho grcab
cr part of tho accidents that American
citizens havo mot with In meantime
"Tho German government still
stands by Its offer to come to an
agreement along those linos.
"As the German government re
peatedly declared, It cannot dlspenso
with tho uso of the submarino weapon
In tho conduct of warfare against
enomy trade. Tho German govern
ment, howover, has now decided to
mako a further concession, adaptlnc
methods of submarine war to tho In
torosts of neutrals.
"In reaching this decision tho Ger
man government Is actuated by con
siderations which arc abovo tho level
of tho disputed question.
"In self-dcfonso ngalnst tho Illegal
conduct of British warfare while
fighting a bitter struggle for national
exlstcnco, Germany had to resort to
Uio hard but effective weapon of sub
marino warfare.
"Tho Gorman government attache
no less importance to Uio sacred prlrv
ciples of humanity than tho govern
ment of tho United States. It again
fully takes into account that both gov
ernments for many years co-operated
In developing international law In con
formity with theso principles, tho ulti
mate object of which has always been
to confino warfare on sea nnd land
to armed forces of belligerents and
safeguard as far as possible non-combatants
against tho horrors of war.
Although these considerations aro of
great weight, they alono would not
under tho present circumstances havo
determined the attitude of tho Gor
man government.
"For, In answer to the appeal by
tho government of the United States
on both of tho sacred principles of
humanity and international law, the
German government must repeat once
moro with all emphasis that it was
not the German, but the British gov
ernment which ignored all accepted
rules of international law and extend
ed this terrible war to the lives and
property of non-combatants, having
no regard whatever for tho Interests
nnd rights of neutrals and noiKora
batants that, through tills method of
warfare, have been severely Injured.
Dlscrmlnatlon Is Charged.
"As matters stand, the German
government cannot but reiterate re
gret that tho sentlmonts of humanity,
which the government of the Untted
States extend with such fervor to Uio
unhappy victims of submarine war
fare, aro not extended with the same
warmth of feeling to many millions of
women and children, who, according
to the avowed Intention of the British
government, shall bo starved and who,
by sufferings, shall force tho victori
ous armies of the central powers Into
ignominious capitulation.
"The German government, in agree
ment with the German people, falls
to under stand this discrimination, all
tho moro as It has repeatedly and
explicitly declared Itself ready to use
the submarino weapon In strict con
formity with tho rules of International
laws as recognized before the out
break of the war, if Great Britain
likewise was ready to adapt tho con
duct of warfare to these rules.
"Several attempts made by tho gov
ernment of tho United States to pre
vail upon the British government to
act accordingly failed because of flat
refusal of the British government.
Moreover, Great Britain again and
again has violated international law,
surpassing all bonds in outraging neu
tral rights. Tho latest measure,
ndopted by Great Britain, declaring
German bunker coal contraband and
establishing conditions under which
English bunker coal alone Is supplied
to neutrals is nothing but an unheard
of attempt by way of exaction to
force neutral tonnaso into tho service
of British trado war.
Reason for Its Concessions.
"Tho German people know that tho
government of tho United States has
tho power to confino the war to armed
forces of tho belligerent countries In
tho interest of humanity nnd main
tonanco of International law. Tho
government of the United States
would have been certain of attaining
this end had It been determined to
Insist against Great Britain on tho
Incontrovertible rights of freedom of
tho seas. But as matters stand tho
German people nro under the Impres
sion that the government of the Unit
ed States, while demanding that Ger
many, struggling for existence, shall
restrain tho uso of nn offectlvo weap
on and while making complianco with
these demands a condition for main
tenance of relations with Germany,
confines Itself to protests against il
legal methods adopted by Germany's
oncmies.
"Moreover, tho German people
know to what considerable extent its
enemies aro supplied with all kinds
of war material from tho United
States.
"It will, therefore, bo understood
that tho nppoal mado by tho govern
ment of tho United States to sontl
ments of humanity and principles of
International law cannot, under tho
circumstances, moot tho samo hearty
response from the German pcoplo
which such an appeal otherwise al
ways is certain to find here. If tho
German government, nevertheless, is
resolved to go to tho utmost limit
of concessions, It has been guided,
not alono by tho friendship connect
ing tho two great nations for over
100 years, but also by tho thought of
tho great doom which threatens the
cntlro civilized world should tho
cruel and sanguinary war bo extended
and prolonged.
"The German government, con
scious of Germany's strength, twlco
within tho last fov months announced
boftiro the world Us readiness to
mako peaco on a basis of safeguard
ing Germany's vital Interests-, thus
indicating that it 1b not Goraany'B
fault If poaco is still withheld from
tho nations of Europe. The German
government feels all Uio moro. Justi
fied in declaring that responsibility
could not bo borno beforo tho forum
of mankind and In history if, after 21
months of the war's duraUon, tho
submarine question under discussion.
between tho German government and
Uio government of tho United States
wero to tako a turn seriously Uireat
cnlng maintenance of peace between
tho two nations.
"As far as lies with the German.
government it wishes to prevent
things from taking such a course. The
Gorman government, moreover, is pre
pared to do its utmost to confine op
erations of the war for the rest of
its duration to tho fighting forces ot
the belligerents, thereby also insur
ing freedom of tho seas, a principle
upon which tho Gorman government
believes, now, as before, fiat it Is In
agreement with tho government of tho
United States.
"Tho German government, guided
by Uils Idea, notifies the government
of tho United States that tho German
naval forces havo received tho fol
lowing order:
"'In accordanco with tho general
