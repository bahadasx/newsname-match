War Department knows Just how far
Cnrrania will go In pressing his de
mand for withdrawal of troops, no steps
will bo taken to push a campaign that
may lead to armed clashes between the
military forces of the two countries.
Definite, announcement Is made, how-
eer.'.that the American troops will not
be withdrawn frojnjMex'cq In the,, face
-of'Carronx'a's" demands.' The"Amerlcan
troops will remain in Mexico, officials
Insist, until President Wilson Is assured
the American-Mexican border Is safe

Washington, has asked his government
tor Instructions as to how to proceed
with the diplomatic negotiations which
are to be resumed following the break
up cr me jsi i'aao oonterences. The
Mexican expedition will remain In statu
quo until Carranza is heard from.
The War Department, though lacking
official information, believes that Major
Langhorne, with four troops of cavalry,
has crossed the Rio Grande on a "hot
trail" after the Glen Bprlngs raiders.
Reports from consular representatives
state that 1,600 , Carranza troops from
Torreon have been sent north into the
Big Bend district. There was no of
ficial explanation of this move.
Intend To Aid.
On the surface the intention of the
Carranza officials In sending troops
north to the disturbed district was to
aid in suppressing border banditry. It
was recalled, however, that after the
Parrot attack on American troops Car
ranza forces were sent north In such
force as to check a further advance
south of American troops.
Army officers believe there may be a
similar intention In sending the Car
ranza force to the Big Bend country,
and that the move may be designed
primarily' to check Langhorne'a advance.
President Wilson and Secretary Baker
evidently are not apprehensive of Im
mediate clashes between American and
v Carranza troops In Mexico.
' The President went down the river on
the Mayflower last night on a week-end
trip. Secretary Baker went to Atlantlo
City )ast night to make an address, and
will go to Newark today for two
speeches.

Man Who Attaoked Sussex Be

Misleading Government.
THREATS SENT TO GERARD
Ambassador Alleged to Have
"Tipped Off" Irish Revolt to
British.
, By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
THE HAGUE, May ll-Severe punish
ment was meted out to the commander
of the Uerman submarine which at
tacked the Sussex, It la generally be
lieved In well-Informed circles In Ber
lin, though no official 'report on the
nature of tho punishment has been
made public.
This belief Is based largely on the
Indignation felt In Germany over the
U-boat commander's deception. His re
port was implicitly believed until the
American Government presented con
clusive evidence showing that the chan
nel packet was torpedoed.
in view of (his evidence, Germans feel
that they were put In a rather humili
ating position. It is not overstating
tho case to say that the submarine
commander's deception caused as much
Indignation In Berlin as It did in Wasn
Ington.
Moves To Prevent Break.
The German govsrnment,, desiring ttf
avoid a break with America at all costs,
has taken two important steps in the
past fortnight to Improve the relations
between the two nations.
The German concessions In the sub
marine matter was one. A quiet move
ment to squelch Teutonic plotters and
Teutonlo propagandists In the United
States and anti-American propagandists
In Germany has been under way for
several days.
Ambassador Gerard has received
scores of letters with threats against
his life, In the past few days. The
writers were Inspired by newspaper In
sinuations that In some way he tipped
oil the Blnn Keln outbreaks In Dublin
In advance to the British government.
Homo of the writers have mentioned
also facta alleged to havo been brought
out through the arrest in New fprK
of Woir von Igel, former secretary to
Captain von Papen, and the confession
or Horat von dcr Goltx, alleged German
arent.
Though the Gcrmir. government has
disclaimed all responsibility for the acts
of homh blotters In thn unltrri Mtaiea.
Chancellor von Bethman-Hoiiweg be
lieves mat some son or arasuc action
should be taken to convince Americana
that Germany has nothing to do with
llie plotters' operations.
Court-martial For Von Rlntelen.
Conferences on this subject have been
going on at Berlin all this week. 1 have
heard, for Instance, that Franz von
Rlntelen, alleged German plotter, will be
court-martialed If he ever returns to
Germany. Though officials retrain from
expressing any opinion as to the guilt
of tho accused men, they declare em
phatically that their acts are without
tho sanction of the German government
or the Kaiser.
Berlin la chiefly worried Just now over
the possibility that aome submarine
commander may accidentally torpedo
without warning a merchant vessel In
the belief that he Is attacking a trans
port, thus bringing a new submarine
crisis with the United' States.
The Kaiser, Chancellor von Bethmann
llollweg, and Admiral von Haltzendorff
are particularly anxious that the sub
mariners take no chances that may In
volve Germany with the United btates.
If tho new orders to submarine com
manders could be published, they would
convince the meet skeptical that Ger
many Is as much concerned as America
lrf preventing accidents In the future.
Five Departments Consulted.
As an Indication of Germany's sincere
desire to find a way to avoid a break
with America, the government asked
five departments what to do when Pres
ident Wilson's untlmatum was received.,
mo toreign oince, me treasury, ana
the interior departments answered:
"Settle honorably. If possible." The
war and navy department answered,
"Settle without entirely surrendering
submarine warfare."
Financial Secretary Helfferlch, backed
by leading financiers, and Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg, backed by Bas
serman, formerly von Tlrpltz's chief
supporter, and General Falkenhayn,
chief of staff of the army, finally drew
tho note which closed the Incident.
Count Reventlow, writing in the Tages
Zeltung, now Is practically alone in cry
ing for vengeance, though occasional
outbursts agalnBt President Wilson and
America are expected for home con
sumption. Ambassador Gerard has won much
praise In Berlin by his cool, forceful di
plomacy. Throughout the negotiations
he worked ceaselessly to convince offi
cials that President Wilson did not want
war with Germany, but merely expected
Germany to keep her promises.
Seek Three Italians.

Italian highwaymen alleged to have
beaten and shot M. A. G. Burgle, early

Burgle pierced his lung. He Is expected
to die.
What Washington Needs
Men of science, physicians, social service experts and leaders in many
lines of civic preparedness have been in Washington during this week. "The
Times asked them what they thought of Washington and what Washington
most needed. Their answers form the basjs of an article that must interest

Walking Out Yesterday.

Declare They Will Stay Out Until

by Company.
Charging 200 employes of the
Washington and Old Dominion
Railway Company with a breach
of faith by going on strike while
arbitration was in progress, Pres
ident Gompers, of the American
Federation of Labor, today denied
them the support of the organ ira
tion and his personal sympathy.
Notwithstanding the fact that'
Rezin Orr, who organized the em
ployes' union for them several
weeks ago joined with President
Gompers in withholding support
from the men, the strikers
this afternoon emphatically an
nounced their intention 'to stay
out until our demands are
granted.'
Ten Thousand patrons of tho
Old Dominion line walked to
work today orcame to Washing

buggies, and are prepared to re

REFUSE TO YIELD.
The break between the Amerlcea Fed
eration of Labor and the striker -caxae
with the ordering of the strike yester
day afternoon, and it was onnounced
that relations between the two would
remain severed untlj the men return to
work.
Officials of the union, while express
ing regret at the stand taken by Presi
dent Gompers, and Rezin Orr, organizer
of the union, emphatically stated they
would not return to work urfOT the
company signed tho new working agree
ment submitted yesterday morning1.
They denied they had broken an arbi
tration agreement with the company,
as charged By President Gompers. Or
ganizer Orr. and President Livingstone,
and Insisted the company had violated
the agreement In various ways.
President Livingstone said this after
noon that no effort had been made to
operate the cars today and he did not
know when rolling stock would begin
to move again. He said "the company
has been stunned by the ordering of a
strike when we had submitted the en
tiro matter to arbitrators. The fact that
the American Federation of Labor and
President Gompers have turned against
the strikers presents an unparalleled
situation and one which cannot but Im
press the public"
Violated Agreement.
"By declaring a strike while arbitra
tion was In progress the empolyes of the
Washington and Old Dominion Com
pany have violated an agreement, and '
unless they go back to work the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, Organizer
Orr, and I personally will wash our
hands of them, and the whole affair,"
said President Gompers.
"We hold agreements between em
ployes and working men to be sacred
and they must be respected," he con
tinued. "The federation must Insist '
that agreements be abided by to the
letter and In spirit Any union affili
ated with thn federation which breaks
an agreement cannot look to the fed
eration for support. The federation has
accomollshed what it has for organized
labor by respecting agreements and It
cannot and will not countenance any
breach of faith bv any union."
Organizer Orr said: "I will not lift
my hand to aid these men until they go
back to work. They must get on their
cars and operate them before they can
look to me for any assistance.
"I have telegraphed to President Ma
hone, head of .the International union. In
Detroit, and advised him of the situa
tion. I have told him of my severance
of relatlonls with these men until they
return to work. I expect a reply from
htm late this afternoon, and I have
every reason to believe he will sustain
mo In my course.
Arbitration In Progress.
President Gompers and Organizer Orr
sold the officers of the union ordered
tho strjke while arbitration was In
progress,' and while they, Gompers and
Orr, were talking with President Liv
ingstone, General Manager Emmert, and
Congressman Carlln.
"When tho company officials went to
President Gompers' room to sign an
agreement that any wage Increases
sgreed upon by the arbitrators would
become effective as of May 1, I told
tho ofricers of the union to remain In
my onice, and no( take any steps until
they heard from mc," said Organizer
Orr. "It was then 3:30 o'clock, and
their meeting was scheduled for 4
o'clock. I suggested that they let the
scheduled hour pass by, If necessary,
and that I would tell them ot the result
or the conference with tho company
officials.
"Notwithstanding this suggestion from
me and the fact that the company
officials were assuring President Gom
pers and myself that they had submitted
the grievances to arbitration, and would
be bound by what the arbitrators did,
the union officials took it upon them
selves to order the strike on their own
