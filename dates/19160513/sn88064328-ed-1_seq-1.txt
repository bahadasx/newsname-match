—
j I'nder the theory that might
inakes light, and a disapplication
of the doctrine of the "survixal of
the fittest" the system of inrr
clumdiziug in America has bceiij
completely revolutionized within
the past quarter century. The
metropolitan stores that have
sought to maintain the high stand
ards in the quality of merchan
dis«', have been forced to compete
with ever-increasing unscnupu
lous methods on the part of stores
tliat "catch the public"' by means
.of "bargain sales," and by an
occasional cut-rates on standard
articles intended to keep the
[crowd moving along their isles,
By these methods unprincipled
dealers grab off sales and profits
that would not be possible were
there any laws in the way of sup
crvisirvr dishonest merchandising,
The country merchant is the
worst sufferer of all, and the ever
trusts and public-service corpora
fions have all been before the imr
of public opinion, and Congress!
and the state legislatures have
made rules for their ,go\eminent,
The present attempt on the part
of Congress to permit the mam:.
facturer of nationally advertised
merchandise to fix the resale
price, is in the logical line of
progress, and is intended to save
the condition of the manufac
turer, protect the newspapers
and other periodicals with their
advertisers. and to relieve the
small merchant who has built up
his business in a narrow circle i
among people who deal with him
because they (know him to be hon- j
est, against that class of mer
chants and mail order men who
have been flim-flamming the pub
lie for many years.—By J. E.
Jones.
ICE TEA BAD FOR KDNEYS.
Many authorities a'Jree that tea
is bad for the kidneys, but it is
a recognized fact that the Indians
•brewed teas from roots and herbs,
which when drunk hot were very
beneficial. A tea of this kind
which is a wonderful medicine is
Ge-Rar-Dy Tea, which eliminates
the poisons from the blood, liver
and kidneys. It is so inexpensive
—only 10 cents a package at Jno.
R. Taylor & Rro. and all other
druggists—that most every home
has it. The Phil P. Cresap Co.,
Ltd. of New Orleans, La., will

DEMONSTRATION WORK.
AMONG NEGROES.
A large number of Negroes
throughout the Parish is working
under demonstration methods.
James M. Burr, Negro Agent has
just completed and sent in to the
State Department and to Wash
ington a list of those following
the methods.
More than fifty Negro farmers
are enrolled and all are doinsr
good woïrL. It is hoped that
many more will join in the work
by the time the next report is
sent in. "Thus far we have
striven to lorate in every thickly
settled Xeg'o community at least
one demonstrator whose work
will serve as an object lesson to
those surrounding him. How
ever, we hope to have every Ne
gro in the Parish cooperating with
us soon," said Burr.
HOW THIS MOTHER
Got Strength To Do Her Work
Fair Haven, Vt — "I was so nervous
end run down that I could not do my
housework for my little family of three.
I had doctored for nearly two years with*
out help. One day I read aoout Vinol,
and thanks to it my health has been re
stored so I am doing all my housework
once mote. 1 am telling all my friends
what Vinol has done for me."— Mrs.
Jambs H. Eddy.
Vinol is • delicious cod Ihrer and iron
Ionic which cr eates a healthy upstit^

PUBLIC ECONOMY.
I
! Although defeated, in my rivent
attempt, to assist this debt bnrd
ened community, yet my interest
"î public affairs is not any more
lessened.
I am a large taxpayer and, as
one, expect to voice my scnti
ments whenever a question iof
public economy arises. The next
matter that should lie considered
is the appointment of a Secretary
and Treasurer by the new Police
Jury. The present Police Jury is
responsible for many serious niis
takes that must be endured by
the taxpayers; if is to be hoped
that the incoming Jury will prove
themselves capable of handling'
the situation in economical and!
business-like manner.
Their first step will he the ap
pointment, of a Secretary and
Treasurer and 1 hope that this ap
pointment will be based purely
upon ability and economy and not
upon politics; and as th -re is h i
tics and only then cai
judiciously.
The daily papers are already,
commenting upon the movements
of the sheriffs of the State in the
coming fight for a continuation
of high fees. 1 ( jnrc say, with hut
iverv little effort they will sue-j
cced, for, as 1 stated many times
during my campaign, the talk of
a redaction in salaries, durintr the
campaign, was a mere de eption
on the part of the candidates,
Mr. Parker might have accomp
lished it, for he was unhampered
by pledges or promises to anyone,
i The condition of those who lin
knowingly make their own burden
j heavier, vbtin«r to their
detriment, simply to prove the
strength of the other party, is.
indeed, deplorable. Never will
things flourish, until each indi
vidu*»l voter realize that he i« re
sponsible for whatever condition
exists.

Young men, there is one thing
you cannot do. You cannot make
a success in life unless you work.
Older men than you have tried it
and failed. You cannot loaf
around the street corner, smoke,
tell stories and sponge on some
one else without making a failure
of life. You must learn a trade
or get into some honest business.
If you don't you will 'become a
chronic loafer, and there is no
place in the world for loafers.
The ripe fruit is at the top of the
tree and you must climb if you

no matter how small or how low
the wages, it. will be a starter.
Help yourself and others will help
you. There is no royal road to
success; will, grit and endurance
are the qualities that lead to it.
