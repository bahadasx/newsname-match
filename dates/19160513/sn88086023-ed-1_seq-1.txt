power for the government to take

osition of the government manufac
turing all Its munitions. The board

The bill appropriates twenty million
dollars for a government nitrate plant.
The president Is empowered to pick
a site. It would extract nitrate from
the air and sell the surplus as fertil
iser. The army will consist of (6 regi
ments of Infantry, 26 of cavalry, 21
of field artillery and seven of engi

BREAD RIOTS IN
GERMANY FORC
fGA.RR.tSON)
(By Carl )
THE HAGUE, May- cvere pun-'
ishment has been meted out to the
commander of the submarine which
attacked the Sussex, it was generally i
believed In Berlin, though an official i
report was lacking. The report ln
tin- street was based on popular Indig
nation over the commander's act In
deceiving the German naval authori
ties regarding the vessel he admitted
i Hacking His report was Implicitly
I believed until America presented con
1 elusive evidence to the contrary. In
I view of this evidence the Germans feel
that they have been humiliated. It
is not overstating the case to say that
the deception caused as much Indig
nation in Berlin as in Washington.
Desiring to avoid a break with Am
erica at all costs, Germany has taken
two important steps within a fort
night to Improve relations. Subma
rine concessions were the first step.
A quiet movement to squelch Teuton
plotters and propagandists in Ameri
ca and anti-American propaganda In
Germany, constituted the other step.
Gerard recently received scores of
threats against his lire. Newspaper
insinuations that he tipped off the Irish
rebellion to England Inspired the
writers. Though Germany disclaimed
responsibility for bomb plotters in
America, Hollweg believes that dras
tic measures should be taken to con
vince America that Germany has
nothing to do with the extremists.
Conferences on this subject have been
on In Berlin for a week.
Officials declare the acts of plot
ters are without the kaiser's sanction.
Berlin chiefly is worried over the pos
sibility someone will torpedo a mer
chantman without warning, believing
it a transport and thus precipitate a
new crisis. The kaiser Is particularly
anxious that submarine commande
not take any chances of Involving
Germany in fresh controversies with
America. If the new submarine or
ders were published it would con
vince the most skeptical that Ger
many was much concerned. In pre
venting future accidents.
Heventlow is practically alone in,
crying for vengeance. His occasion-
a outbursts against Wilson probably
are intended for home consumption.
Gerard has won the hearty praise of
Berlin for his diplomacy In the sub
marine crisis. Indicating Germany's
desire to avoid a break, the govern
ment asked five departments what t
do when Wilson's ultimatum was re
ceived. The foreign office, treasury
department and department of the In
terior answered, "Settle."
