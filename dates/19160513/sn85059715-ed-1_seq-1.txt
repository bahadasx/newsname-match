MORE LIQUOR

WASHINGTON, May 13.?Notwith
standing the fact that prohibition laws
have become effective in seven states
since July 1, 1915, approximately
7,500,000 gallons more whiskey has1
been produced in the United States so i
far during this fiscal year ending June
30 than ever before. Returns to the

AMONG THE VOTERS
William F. Ilito.
William F. Hltc, of Huntington, whose likeness here appears is a dls
tinguished visitor in the city, who is shaking hands with many Clarksburg
and Harrison county citizens tolay. The reception given hlni us a candidate
for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate is all that can be i
desired, indeed, it is royal on every hand. As a mlngler among his follow
men, the present visit here shows him one worth while. Ho knows how to
meet men and they all feel that they have met a real man in him.
Business men, farmers, indeed, men of all classes havo mot and are
meeting him today and giving him warm assurances of support, and it Is a
common remark among them: "I intend to vote for that man Hito. Ho
strikes me as the man of the hour, the very fellow we all want and need in
the United States Senate."
Mr. Hite has been here several times during the campaign, but on those
occasions he was passing thro'i&h to other points of the state, and did not
have much time to tarry. The present visit, however, is ono for the city
and county alone, although many from other counties are here greeting the
candidate.
On his former short visits here, he met many Clarksburgers, but he is
reaping a great harvest of assurances today and working like a trooper in
meeting a situation here not unlike that, wherever he goes in the campaign,
namely, greeting and talking with those who flock to him in their eagerness
to see the man they have heard fo much about and for whose nomination
they long since decided they would vote. And it is stating it mildly that none
is disappointed in his expectation. j
The present reception alone Js a sufficient guarantee to Mr. Hite. his'
friends and supporters that he will carry Harrison county overwhelmingly
at the primary election June 6.
"Mr. Hite expiesses the desire to see all tho voters possible while here and
lie announces that he Is staying at the Waldo where he will he glad to re
ceive all those ho can not see on his trip around town. ?
Speaking of the outlook, Mr. '-lite says he Is especially pleased with the
progress his campaign has made throughout the state and he has every assur
ance that he will be nominated for the Senate. He has campaigned practically ,
all over the state and there Is no place where he has not been assured of a
support that spells nomination.
The Hite campaign has become so strong that it is invulnerable to attack,
such ns "Abe" Lilly, who has virtually renounced the party which gave blm |
the office he now holds, made at Huntington Inst night, when he charged Hite
with paying Judge Robinson'B campaign expenses. Such attacks show the i
straits Lilly finds himself in, but they fall upon the minds nf the people like
water on a duck's back. They are sure signs that Hite and right will prevail
when the smoke of battle is over.
