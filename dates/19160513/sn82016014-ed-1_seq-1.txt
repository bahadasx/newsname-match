Why Roosevelt
An Open Letter To Patriotic Americans; A Most Interesting Truthful Page Which Every Fair Minded Reader Should Study and Ponder; For Every One Who Believes in
WE BELIEVE that Theodore
Roosevelt as our next
President will be our country's
best guarantee of peace with the
world.
That belief, based upon the
actual character of the man, is
absolutely proved by his own
deeds when he was President.
By the "character of the
man," we don't mean mere pro
fessions. For, in July, 1914, all
the rulers of Europe that are
now at war professed how much
they wanted peace. So, profes
sions of peace, unless they are
backed up by the deeds that
compel peace, are only froth.
By the "character of the
man," we do mean that charac
ter which is revealed by an un
varying, straight line of actions.
In America that is all that
counts. Lincoln once said, "In
lieu of a written platform, a
man's record is his platform."
Some Obsolete Misconceptions.
Theodore Roosevelt's record
for peace has been a sore disap
pointment to his enemies. Since
the beginning of his career they
have predicted, again and again,
that he was a "dangerous man
who would lead the country into
trouble."
Because of his consistent doc
trine that among nations weak
ness invites aggression, that un
preparedness invites attack, he
has been called by his enemies
"a menace to peace."
Thus, when he was nominated
for Governor of New York in
1898, three years before he be
came President, Carl Schurz
wrote :
"Roosevelt virtually . asks us
to endorse, by electing him, his
kind of militant imperialism
which has no bounds. Accord
ing to him we need a big navy,
'a far larger regular army than
we have now,' not for the pur
pose of keeping order at home,
but for action abroad. I would
not put him in a position, nor
open to him the way to a posi
tion, in which he would exercise
any influence upon the foreign
policy of the Republic ; for I can
didly believe that he is very
dangerously deficient in that pa
tient prudence which is neces
sary for the peaceful conduct of
international affairs.
"I cannot support him when
his election is generally admitted
to be a stepping stone to a place
in which his hot impulses and
his extreme notions of militant
imperialism might do the coun
try more irreparable harm than
anything I can think of."
That same year, 1898, the
New York Times said,- editor
ially :
"Mr. Roosevelt presents him
self as a great fighting man, a
believer in keeping the flag
wherever it has been planted,
and in maintaining a big army
and navy. . . . He is present
ed as a foe of closer relations for
peace with our close kin across
the sea, and as a man of notable
dash."
In the presidential campaign
of 1904, Col. Henry Watterson
declared :
"For the life of me I cannot
see how any self-respecting
mugwump can vote for Roose
velt. . . . Parker, the jurist,
means peace with all nations, en
tangling alliances with none.
Roosevelt, the war-lord, means
corruptions at home, complica
tions abroad."
Three years later, in 1907,
when Roosevelt sent the battle
ship fleet on its cruise around
the world, the New York Sun
said, in an editorial:
"We are asked to believe that
the expedition to the Pacific is
a mere 'practice cruise.' He
must be a miracle of innocent
credulity who believes it. What
observant men perceive in this
dangerous situation is a cata
clysm, trained and bridled for
Theodore Roosevelt to bestride
and run amuck."
Right here, before going any
further, the interesting after
math of these predictions must
be remarked :
Carl Schurz, seven years later,
wrote congratulations to Roose
velt on his arrest of the Russo
Japanese War. The Times, after
seeing his triumphant presiden
tial record for arbitration, and
for the promotion of closer
friendship "across the sea,"
heartily endorsed his staunch-
Mr. Roosevelt's Portrait Is reproduced
ness for peace. The Sun, after
longer observation of him, said,
"When charged with responsi
bility he is as cautious and canny
as any doctor of philosophy."
; But the above sayings are
samples of the many misconcep
tions regarding Roosevelt in
former years. Many unin
formed Americans still cherish
them so persistent is the mem
ory of an old party-cry. These
misconceptions are now revived
and fostered by enemies who
choose to forget the stainless
record.
The Record of Facts.
But what are the Facts?
They show a peace record that is
100 per cent perfect.
During the seven and one
half years that he was President
he pursued one invariable and
consistent foreign policy; a pol
icy of international good-will and
consideration for the rights of
others, and at the same time of
steady preparedness.
Durinj his seven and a half
years in the White House not
an American rifle was fired in
war.
Yet. there were no less than
seven occasions when a presi
dential diplomacy just a shade
less firm, just a word less
friendly, just a thought less
wise, might have produced war.
Seven critical occasions they
were.
Todav we see their full sicr-
nificance, and tremble at what
we escaped. But at the time
each affair was handled so
astutely by Roosevelt that the
danger was scarcely realized
outside his Cahinet. TnHperl.
the very means Roosevelt then
employed to escape the danger
were bitterly criticized by many
who saw nothing of the menace,
which, for the sake nf
kept out of public discussion.
ttere is the record, a peace
victory a year, won by astute di
plomacy. Great Britain
The first was with Creat Brit
ain. There was a bitter dispute
about the boundary of Alaska.
After the Klondike boom the Ca
nadians realized the value of the
strip of coast running south.
iney revived a claimed ambig
uity in the original treaty of
1825 between Russia and Great
Britain, declaring that that coast

claim was absurd. Great Britain
ottered to arbitrate. Roosevelt
refused because our title was so
sound, and arbitrators like to
compromise.
Here were the makings of
trouble. If Roosevelt had let
congress and the press get into
the discussion, it is easy to see
how public anger would have
blazed up, both here and in Great
Britain, and the British would
W
have had to humiliate them
selves or else fight.
But instead, Roosevelt clever
ly gave the British a chance to
turn down their own claim and
keep their pride. He proposed a
Joint Commission, three Ameri
cans and three British, thus leav
ing the matter to the conscien
tious justice of both parties. At
the same time Roosevelt sent
by courtesy of Collier's.
troops to occupy the disputed re
gion. When m 1903 the Joint Com
mission gave its decision, the
Lord Chief Justice of England,
who was one of the British mem
bers, had voted with the Ameri
cans the two Canadian mem
bers sticking by their claim.
Thus Roosevelt avoided all
peril of angry public discussion,
with its hot and unforgivable
words which would have raised
the warlike issue of "national
honor." He averted the mis
chances of a third-party arbitra
tion. He gave the British a
noble chance to inspect and with
draw their claim.
He produced peace, fostered
friendship and kept the Alas
kan strip.
Germany
The second occasion was with
Germany.
Venezuela had defaulted its
payments to German and other
European creditors. Under Ger
many's leadership Venezuela
was blockaded and a threat was
made to bombard its ports and
occupy its coast.
Roosevelt was watching, but
not waiting too long. He an
nounced our stand on the Mon
roe Doctrine : "We do not guar
antee any state against punish
ment if it misconducts itself, pro
vided the punishment does not
take the form of the acquisition
of territory by any non-American
power."
Germany professed she had no
such intentions at least no
"permanent acquisition." She
felt free to make a "temporary"
acquisition. But Roosevelt knew
how temporary acquisitions by
European powers soon become
permanent. So he asked, through
the German ambassador, Dr.
Holleben, the emperor's consent
to arbitration. It was refused.
Finally, Roosevelt told the
German ambassador that if he
didn't receive the emperor's con
sent in ten days he would order
Admiral Dewey, then south of
Cuba, to take his fleet to Vene
zuela to prevent a foreign land
ing.
A week passed. The German
ambassador said no consent had
come. He was sure none would
come. Roosevelt remarked to
him, pleasantly: "Then there's
no use in Dewey's waiting the
full ten days. If the assurance
doesn't come in 48 hours, Dewey
will sail.
It came (in 36 hours), and
Dewey didn't sail. But the em
peror politely asked Roosevelt
to become the arbitrator in the
dispute with Venezuela. Roose
velt declined the honor, turning
the business over to The Hague
court of arbitration.
Roosevelt publicly applauded
the emperor's magnanimity in
ouio De uur oest
the cause of peace; and for the
sake of good feeling kept saga
ciously silent about the inner
facts. These we're not known to
the public till years afterwards
when the Life of Secretary Hay
was published.
At the time, Roosevelt simply
announced to congress that in
stead of accepting this courteous
invitation to be the arbitrator he
had considered it "an admirable
opportunity to advance the prac
tice of a peaceful settlement of
disputes between nations, and to
secure for The Hague Tribunal a
memorable increase of its practi
cal importance."
. It was a masterly escape from
war. Another kind of president
would have kept sending notes
till Germany had occupied and
fortified the territory. Then to
dislodge her, in defense of our
Monroe Doctrine, we would have
been in for an aggressive and
dubious war. But instead of con
tinuous correspondence, record
ed and given to the press, Roose
velt sent one quiet, verbal and
private "Dewey-in-48-hours" ul
timatum. Japan
The third occasion was with
Japan.
In 1906 California was ablaze
against the Japanese. Califor
nia excluded the Japanese child
ren from her common schools.
California demanded protection
against Japanese coolie immigra
ti Dn.
But our treaty with Japan
guaranteed these privileges to
the Japanese .
Then Roosevelt showed his
deepest skill.
In the name of the treaty with
Japan, Tie brought legal suits to
restore the school status of the
Japanese children. The schools
were again opened to them. (He
had also quietly increased the
federal garrison in San Fran
cisco.)" --v "
For the sake of California, he
had informal negotiations with
high Japanese officials who, by
the way, preferred to keep their
coolies at home. These were
"conversations between gentle
men," unpublished, and thus free
from misconstruction by the
public. The Japanese gracefully
agreed not to issue passports for
their coolies to come here.
Japanese rights and pride
were fully protected. Califor
nian protests were fully regard
ed. Japan was led to play the
part of noblesse oblige, and was
justly proud of her own large
ness of mmd.
The war menace, openly dis
cussed in Japan, melted before
our public was awake to it.
Battle Fleet
Yet, just then, lest any for
eigners should fancy we were in
fear, Roosevelt ordered our en

tire battleship fleet, fully equip
ped, to sail around the world, in-1
cidentally making a friendly call
on Japan. . !
. No other nation had ever sent
its full fleet on a "round-the-world"
cruise. Its physical pos
sibility was doubted. In the
press and even in congress the
order was attacked, and the
threat made to withhold funds.
But Roosevelt knew, and he
persisted. The fleet was then,
thanks to himself, at its highest
efficiency. The world saw. Japan
saw.
The happy ending of the
threatening episode was due to
Roosevelt's fairness of judgment,
to his firmness with California,
to his adroitness with Japan
and to the big fleet.
Santo Domingo Cuba
Colombia
Besides these three major oc
casions, with Great Britain,
Germany and Japan, there were
three minor ones, with Santo
Domingo, Cuba and Colombia.
Santo Domingo, in perpetual
revolutions, defaulted 5 1 her
debts, and there was danger of
European intervention, as in
Venezuela. Roosevel'; did an un
precedented thing. He diplo
matically led the Santo Domingo
Government to request an Amer
ican official to finance her cus
tom receipts. Roosevelt con
sented to send an American offi
cer for that purpose who should
set aside 55 per cent for the
debts and 45 per cent for the
Santo Domingans. Here not a
shadow of force was shown, the
natives were satisfied, the debts
were paid, and Europe was kept
off.
Cuba came to a deadlock in her
own affairs. President Palma
asked for United States forces
to help him. But Roosevelt sent
one man, Secretary Taft, to ad
vise with the- Cubans. When
Palma resigned, Taft was there,
and the Cubans wanted him to
stay. Not till then did Roosevelt
send American soldiers, accord
ing to the "Piatt Amendment"
provision, to maintain peace be
tween the factions. As soon as
the factions agreed, he with
drew our troops, with never a
hostile shot, and the Cubans
again realized our justness.
Panama was a case of differ
ent color. Colombian troops had
sailed to fight the Panama Re
public back to submission. But
the American war-ships got
there first. The Colombian gen
eral was told that fighting would
endanger the lives of American
citizens who were there, and he
was advised to sail back again.
Again, not a gun was fired. But
Roosevelt was there in time,
with wise advice and with
ships.
These celebrated cases are
Aiuaranicee or
enough - to prove Roosevelt's
resoluteness for peace, and his
prompt practicality in produc
ing peace.
By Davenport.
From N. T. Evening Mall.
"HE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME."
But two other instances of his
foreign diplomacy for peace, the
most familiar and famous of all,
must be recorded in this review.
"Perdicaris Alive or Raizuli
Dead"
When one American citizen,
Mr. Perdicaris, had been kid
napped for ransom by the bandit
Raizuli in Morocco, Roosevelt
had a case which suggests Mex
ico. The Sultan of Morocco
was suspected of being "in
with" the fierce rebel bandit.
Also, a complicated game of
European politics was being
played in Morocco. Negotiations
brought nothing to pass. Then
arrived Roosevelt's final mes
sage, through Secretary Hay,
sent to the American Consul
(with a war-ship in the harbor)
"Perdicaris alive or Raizuli
dead." Perdicaris was delivered
the next day. A startled Eu
rope realized that the . United
States had a President who was
resolute to the minute when
even one citizen was attacked.
Russo-Japanese Peace
Roosevelt's greatest foreign
fame rests on his promotion of
the Treaty which ended the
Russo-Japanese War. The cred
it fully belongs to him. He per
ceived the psychological moment
for suggesting peace In that aw
ful conflict. As a friend of both
Japan and Russia he plunged in.
He invited the Commissioners
of Peace to sit in Portsmouth.
When a deadlock arrived in that
conference Roosevelt dared to
intrude as the pressing friend,
and peace was signed.
The Nobel Peace Prize to Roose
velt For this achievement he was
endowed with the first Nobel
Peace Prize, of $40,000 (which
he turned over at once to the In
dustrial Peace Commission.)
The whole civilized world warm
ly concurred in the sentiment ex
pressed in that solemn award,
that Roosevelt was the foremost
producer of peace of this gener
ation. Another Peace Tribute to Roose
velt He received, in 1906, a fur
ther foreign tribute, not only
for his part in arresting the
Russo-Japanese War, but also
for his several forceful actions in
promoting world-peace by arbi
tration. This tribute meant
even more than the Nobel Prize.
It was a spontaneous, volun
teered testimonial, signed by
two hundred and fifty of the
most powerful men of France.
It was. a "Recognition of the per
sistent and decisive initiative he
has , taken , towards gradually
substituting friendly and judi
cial for violent methods in cases
of conflict between Nations" ;
and it declared that "the action
of President Roosevelt has real
ized the most generous hopes to
be found in history."
This French appreciation is
made still clearer by the per
sonal tribute of the greatest of
European Pacifists, the Baron
d'Estournelles de Constant, who
said at that time :
"President Roosevelt has al
ready given four striking lessons
to Europe first, by having
brought before the Arbitration
Tribunal at The Hague the ques
tion between the United States
and Mexico over the Pious Fund
claims, while Europe was still
scoffing at the Peace court it
had created ; second, in obliging
Europe to settle pacifically the
Venezuelan affair ; third, in pro
posing a second Peace Confer
ence at The Hague to complete
the work of the first; and
fourth, in now intervening to put
an end to the hecatombs in the
Far East."
Our Ablest Man- Is Needed for
Peace
Do not all of these specifica
tions prove, beyond the perad
venture of a doubt, that as a res
olute Producer of Peace, the
practical, straight-seeing,
prompt-acting Roosevelt . towers
above all those professional pac
ifists that belong to the class
whom the Bible condemns for
repeating the empty words,
"Peace, peace, when there is no
peace" ?
For Roosevelt believes that
"when there is no peace," a
strong, commonsense way must
be found quickly to produce
peace. He also believes that
when a foreign aggressor men
aces our peace, it is more surely
preserved by a righteous courst
backed by courage, than by. a
vacillating course based on safety-first.
- .
The above record, now known
to all the world, is the Answer
to the pessimistic predictions of
Roosevelt's critics quoted at the
beginning. The same old pessi
mism, with a fresh voice, is be
ing uttered now by some other
opponents who either are ignor
ant of Roosevelt's history, or are
wilfully blinded by prejudice.
jreace
Peace and Preparedness
But history will repeat itself. If
Roosevelt becomes President,
these new voices, like the old
voices, will in their turn applaud.
His attitude on peace and war
is rooted in the deepest charac
ter of the man. Here is a per
sonal declaration more convinc
ing than idealistic oratory. He
said on January 1, 1916:
"Foolish people say that I want war.
There is probably not in all this coun
try a man who abhors war more and
would dread more to see it come upon
us. If this nation should go to war I
would go myself, and all my four sons
would go. and certainly one and per
haps both of my sons-in-law: and my
wife, my daughters, and the wives of
my sons would suffer more than tha
men who went. No father or mother
in this audience needs to be told of tha
sorrow that would be the lot of my
wife and myself if we had to see our
four sons go to war."
No declaration for peace uttered by
any American rings with more manly
sincerity. Grant said. "Let us have
peace"; Sherman said, "War is helL
With greater tenderness. Roosevelt
utters the same love of peace, tha
same fearful dread of war. No paci
fist has said words that so grip tha
loving family heart.
Therefore, based on a character
that has been proved by deeds:
We believe that Roosevelt's election
as president would be a real guarantee
of peace: for the world knows from
past experience that he means what
he says, and backs his professions
of peace.
We believe that the Nations of Eu,
rope, remembering Roosevelt's mighty
works for peace, still rely on his fair
ness: and were he president today, he
would be the one man to whom Eu
rope would turn in this awful hour as
a trusted counsellor. ;
We believe, further, that if elected
president, his unfailing diplomacy,
high courage and wisdom, may yet aid
in bringing about an early and Just
settlement of the present European
war, as he helped to bring about th
termination of the Russo-Japanese
war. ...
We believe, finally, that, if Roose
velt were elected on the 7th of next
November, on the following day every
government Jn the world would begin
to shape its course by its abundant
knowledge of Roosevelt's past record
in international affairs. But if a new
man should be elected on the 7th. Im
mediately all those governments would
say, "Here is another man we do not
know; we will wait and try him out
for a year or two to see what stuff he
has in him."
We urge all good citizens, of every
party, to ' regard these momentous
tai ls from tlie broad, patriotic stand
point of tlit nation's future peace,
honor, and prosperity. In this crisis,
or in any greater crisis that may later
arise. America needs lier safest nun
lvr stroneest man her greatest man;
she needs Theodore Roosevelt.
