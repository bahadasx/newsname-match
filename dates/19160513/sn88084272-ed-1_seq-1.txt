GREATEST RESERIB II
ELEPHANT BUTTE, N M, May 13. "Work was completed here today on
the Elephant Butte dam, a United States reclamation project, which, by
damming the Rio Grande, forms the greatest storage reservoir in the
world. Construction began five years ago. The reservoir will feed an irri
gation system which will water 180,000 acres In New Mexico, Texas and
Mexico. .
The dam blocks a canyon in the Rio Grande 120 miles north of EI Paso.
It is the fifth of the government's big irrigation projects and will store
the entire flow and flood of the river The reservoir will be 40 miles long
and will store enough water, reclamation service experts say, to cover the
state of Delaware to a depth of twofeet.
The dam stands 318 feet high and Is 1674 feet long. It provides a
roadway across the canyon 18 feet wide and at its base is 235 feet thick.
The government, before beginning construction of the dam. laid out a
town equipped with modern conveniences, such as electric lights, water
and sewerage, stores, schools, hospitals, hotels and a theater.
