COMVICTS FED TOO WELL
Chemists Say Inmates of State Insti
tution Get Too Much Food.
Topeka, Kan.The men confined in
the Kansas penitentiary are fed better
than is necessary for the work that is
required of them, according to a report
on the food served the prisoners by
Professor E. H. S. Bailey of the chem
ical laboratories of the University of
Kansas. The report has been filed with
the civil service commission. The test
was made of the foods served to the
prisoners in December and January.
The chemists collected samples of the
twenty-four different articles of food
furnished the prisoners, and only three
were found to be below standard, and
the quantity furnished each prisoner
was more than sufficient for his needs.
The cheese was of poor quality, and the
pepper contained too many pepper
shells. The bread, while nutritious,
was not first class, due to a poor bak
ery at the prison.
"Some of the inmates of the peniten
tiary are performing hard, muscular
work," said the report, "but a large
number are doing only moderate work,
so that the average would not be much
above moderate muscular work, which
chemists have found can be done eflfc
ciently on food containing 3,400 calo
ries or heat units daily. In no case was
the food served at the prison below
4,000 calories a day, and in many in
stances the food was above 5,000 calo
ries a day."
"AN ETHER SOUSE."
Prisoner Tells Judge Why He Stole
Drug From Hospital.
Los Angeles, Cal.How and why he
invaded the county hospital, stole a
can of ether, a package of iodoform
and a roll of bandages, told by H. L.
McCaslin in Judge White's court, was
declared by the court to be the most pe
culiar statement ever made before him.
McCaslin described himself as "an
ether souse" and pleaded guilty to the
larceny charge. According to his story,
his indulgence in the soporific dates
back two years. He said:
"One night I started to ride to work
at Bakerfield on a motorcycle and on
the way was struck by a car. They
took uie to a hospital to operate on my
leg. and for the first time in my life I
smelled ether. I thought it was the
finest experience I ever had. Since
then I have persuaded six more doc
tors to operate on me. Then I found I
could buy the drug.
"Lately I have been living in Po-
mon... On Orange day I brought some
of the fruit from Pomona to the county
hospital, where I met some of the boys
who were there when I was a patient.
I got a change to get a big can and
some things for my leg. Then I was
arrested."
Judge White sentenced McCaslin to
ninety days in jail.
MONEY IN WOODEN LEG.
Body to Be Exhumed In Search For
Woman's Wealth.
St. Louis, Mo.Charles Kroener of
Detroit will have the body of Miss
Elizabeth Hauck exhumed at Alton to
look for money which he thinks she
may have concealed in her wooden leg.
When she died, Sept. 15, $700 was
found in her clothing. Kroener, who
was her guardian, thinks she must
have had more money than that
Kroener also doubts whether the
finding of the coroner's jury that she
killed herself is correct He Is mak
ing an investigation,and will place evi
dence in the hands of the state attor
ney and ask him to take action.
Miss Hauck was thirty-five years old.
She was formerly in the millinery busi
ness in St. Louis, at California avenue
and Arsenal street. She set herself
up in business with part of the $3,000
she received from a railroad company
for the loss of her leg twenty years
ago. On account of failing health she
stored her millinery stock and went to
Alton.

Later Seized With Convulsions After
Reading Newspaper Headlines.
New York.A well dressed woman
gazed fixedly at headlines of newspa
pers
ion a stand at Fourteenth street
and Sixth avenue for a few moments
and then fainted. Later she was seized
with convulsions.
The hundreds attracted by her
screams and struggles with two police
men heard her say she had lost two
brothers in the war. Dr. Loughlin of
St Vincent's hospital diagnosed the
case as acute dementia, probably caus
ed by her bereavement, suddenly re
called by what she had read In the
headlines.
At Bellevue hospital the woman said
she was Mollie Fogarty, but gave no
address. She is about thirty-five years
old.
Three Brothers Lose Eye Apiece.
Albert Lea, Minn.The right eye of
Hugo Brenner, a young farmer, was

MINISTER QUITS CHURCH
BECAUSE MEMBERS SMOKE
He Did Not Want Tobacco Used at In
formal Meetings of a Brotherhood.
Members Bitterly Opposed Him.
Jefferson City, Mo.As the result of
a controversy with the members of the
local Presbyterian brotherhood over
the question of whether there should
be smoking at the Informal meetings
of that body, Rev. J. A. Cowling, pas
tor of the Presbyterian church of Jef
ferson City, resigned.
Mr. Cowling was opposed to the use
of tobacco by members of the brother
hood at their meetings and on one oc
casion openly suggested that smoking
be not permitted. The members of the
brotherhood, by common consent, went
on with the smoking at the meetings.
First one and then another member
would bring along a box of cigars.
The smoking controversy went on for
several weeks, and gradually the rela
tions between pastor and brotherhood
became more strained, with the result
that Mr. Cowling tendered his resigna
tion and the congregation voted to ac
cept it.,
LAW SURELY GIVES
A PUZZLE TO SOLVE
Owner of Bees Must Know Name
of Every One Before He Can
Swear Out a Warrant.
Birmingham, Ala.Becoming Involv
ed in a dispute over a trivial matter,
two citizens of Montgomery county
struck a snag in the law when a
swarm of bees owned by one migrated
to the home of the other. This renew
ed the trouble, and W. C. Frizzle,
bailiff of the city court, was appeal
ed to.
"I want my bees," said the original
owner. "They have gone to that fel
low's home."
Frizzle began an Investigation to
ascertain whether he had authority to
return the bees to the rightful owner.
After consulting many lawbooks this
was his conclusion, as expressed in
his own words:
"I find that before you can obtain
your bees you must have them arrest
ed in the regular way. And before
they can be arrested you must swear
out an individual warrant against ev
ery bee In the swarm. I also find that
before you can swear out an individual
warrant against every bee you must
know the name of each one."
The rightful owner said he was will
ing to give his neighbor a warrant
deed to one swarm of bees, but he did
not know the name of each one in the
swarm. So the bees are still in their
new home.
GIRLS WITH FLOWER NAMES.
Arrange a Club For the Study of Wild
Plants.
Mill Valley, Cal.Out of the deep
tangled wildwood of this hamlet, nes
tling at the base of Mount Tamalpais,
has come a school children's club,
unique at least in the nomenclature of
its governing officers.
The club has been organized for the
study of wild flowers, which are now
a gay pattern of many colors over the
sloping hills of the countryside. The
children, mostly girls, met and elected
oflicers, as follows: President, Char
lotte Rose vice president, Margaret
Leaf secretary, Doris Plant treasurer,
Mary Moss Directors, Violet White
and Fern Murphy.
They will begin at once their studies,
which are to be prosecuted vigorously
in all of their out of school hours.
No blooms of rarest ray serene will
be permitted to bud and blush unseen
in the shady dells of Tamalpais.
CHILD SAVES HOME.
Little Boy Fights Fire and Climbs on
Chair to Telephone For Help.
Lead, S. D.Nerve and pluck exhib
ited by the five-year-old son of Mr. and
Mrs. Sidney Mitchell saved both him
self and the family home from destruc
tion by flre, although the child was
nearly overcome when the firemen res
cued him.
The little fellow had been left alone
with a playmate while his parents were
out, and they commenced to play with
matches. Soon the bed was afire, and
the flames spread.
The other boy ran out, but the Mitch
ell child fought the flames with small
pails of water, In the meantime climb
ing on a chair to reach the telephone,
by which he notified the fire depart
ment Chemicals quickly extinguished
the blaze.
Hens Lay Two Eggs a Day.
Sandusky, OHenry McEUery, a
farmer living near Milan, says he has
built a henhouse so Illuminated with
acetylene gas that each day is divided
into four periods, two of darkness and
two of light so alternated that his hens
have what they think is two days and
two nights every twenty-four hours.
"The result Is an egg from each hen
every time one of the artificial days
dawns," said McEllery, who, fighting
the high cost of living, refuses to pro
tect his scheme.

ST. PAUL AND MINNEAPOLIS. MINN.. SATURDAY: MAY
TRIBE NOW DEM).
Ishi, Noted Aborigine, Succumbs
to White Plague.
ORIGIN MADE HIM FAMOUS.
Shown as Survivor of Last Tribe of
Deer Creek Indians Of Yano Line.
Lived on Victims of His Bow and
Arrow.
San Francisco.Ishi has been gath
ered to the land of his fathers.
Last of the Deer Creek Indians, tribe
of Yano, Ishi has gone to the happy
hunting grounds. He died at the Uni
versity of California hospital, a victim
of the "white plague," disease of the
paleface.
For several months the aborigine,
who was captured in the wilds of
northern Butte county in the summer
of 1911, had been in ill health. A year
ago he developed acute lung trouble,
and at times he suffered greatly, bear
ing his pain with the stoicism of his
kind.
Just a few minutes before he passed
away Ishi joked with Curator Gifford
of the affiliated colleges. At that time
he was In agony. Final relief came
with a hemorrhage.
Ishi, who never had seen any money
of the white man until he was brought
into civilization, left what he consider- I
ed a fortune in worldly 'goodsabout
$350 and personal effects. With the
common desire of all California In
dians, Ishi labored to accumulate
wealth. Unlike the members of most
tribes, whose standing is rated by
what they give away, Ishi, with the
characteristics of California and Brit
ish Columbia Indians, hoarded his pen
nies, which he earned in various ways.
His estate was taken In charge by the
public administrator.
Ishi, living the life of a savage in
Butte county, stole a calf in the sum
mer of 19.11, and officers of the law
ran him down. They were amazed to
discover the thief was^ a primitive
creature, clad in animal skins and
armed only with a bow and arrow.
The prisoner was taken to the Butte
county jail, and it was there that
T. T. Waterman, assistant professor in
anthropology, pronounced him to be
the only surviving member of the lost
tribe of Deer Creek Indians of the
Yano line.
The scientific world was greatly in
terested in Professor Wa%ermaTTs an
nouncement, and Ishi became famous.
He was brought to this city and lodg
ed at the affiliated colleges on Sept. 4,
1911. After months of patient effort
Professor Waterman was able to talk
with Ishi. What he learned from the
captive left no doubt in his mind that
Ishi really was the last of the savage
tribe of Deer Creek.
Ishi adapted himself to the ways of
the white man. He built himself a
home on the grounds of the affiliated
colleges, where he was the object of
much curiosity. He attended lectures
by Professor Waterman and other sa
vants of the State university.
In May, 1914, Ishi took Dr. A. L.
Kroeber, head of the affiliated colleges
museum, and Dr. Saxton T. Pope to
Butte and showed them his former
haunts, reverting to his skins and
bows and arrows. The report of Dr.
Koeber and Dr. Pope confirmed the be
lief of Ishi's descent
KILL 2,000 RABBITS IN DRIVE.
California Farmers Wreak Vengeance
on Field Pests.
Stockton, CalIt is estimated 2,000
jack rabbits were killed in the south
San Joaquin district and at least one
coyote met his fate in the rabbit drive
held by the south San Joaquin farmers
under the direction of Ed Powers of
Manteca and county farm bureau offi
cials.
Hunters from all parts of the coun
try gathered in the south San Joaquin
during the morning, and when the
chase started at 9:30 o'clock there were
more than 400 shotguns pointed out to
ward the hiding places of the long
legged jacks.
The march on the rabbits lasted from
9:30 in the morning until after 2
o'clock in the afternoon, and during
the afternoon hundreds of automobile
parties visited that part of the country
to see the huntsmen and others gather
ing up the slain field pests.

HID HUSBAND'S FALSE TEETH.
Jefferson Swears That Is the Way His
Wife Got Money From Him.
Pittsburgh.It behooves all married
tightwads who wear false teeth to be
ware. Often the subject of ridicule,
artificial teeth have at last been found
to serve a practical purpose in domes
tic life.
Frank Jefferson In divorce court told
harrowing story of the manner in
which his wife had frequently forced
him to "come across" with money by
the simple expedient of taking his
false teeth and hiding them.
The odd thing, to Jefferson's way of
thinking, was that even when he wax
ed angry his wife would refuse to re
turn his teeth. Only Uncle Sam's coin
of the realm would persuade her that
her husband's molars were essential
and necessary to his dally existence.
Mrs. Jefferson's side of the case was
terse and to the pointher husband
had refused her the money she believ
ed she was entitled to as lady of the
house. Consequently she took these
measures to get it.

him and realizing that death was near.
he made an incision in the woman's
windpipe with his knife, and, using
the teaspoons bent double as retrac
tors, he Inserted the rubber tube. Res
piration was restored, and within a
few hours the patient regained con
sciousness, and it is said that her re
covery is expected.
ODDLY HEARS OF LEGACY.
Benefactor Learns of Bequest After He
Nearly Drowned.
Gloucester City, N. J.Through an
account published of the fact that he
had been rescued from drowning when
he fell overboard while unloading coal
at the Gloucester ferry wharf, Frank
Taylor of 402 South Fourth street re
ceived word that he had been left a
legacy by a relative in South Jersey,
who died several months ago.
An aunt wrote from Deerfield, N. J.,
stating that they had been endeavor
ing to find him for several months and
that they had read in a Philadelphia
newspaper of his accident and hasten
ed to notify him that when the rela
tive died he had been mentioned in the
will for a portion of the estate, which
consisted of a farm and agricultural
implements. FIRST TIME ON STEAM
GARS AT AGE OF 82
He'd Drive Any Place Where
He Liked Conversation.
Kansas City.Not until his six-year
old grandson took him in charge did
Peter Franklin McCubbin of Virginia,
eighty-two years old, ride on a railroad
I train. He passed through this city
recently with the grandson, Morris
Williamson, on the way to Salt Lake
City, where he will live with his
daughter, Morris' mother.
At the Union station Mr. McCubbin
showed a keen interest in things around
him and said he had enjoyed his trip a
great deal.
"It wasn't because I was afraid of
i trains that I didn't ride on them," he
said. "I just never had occasion to go
anywhere I couldn't drive.
"I raised a family of eight children,
and, although they all insisted, I never
went to see any of them. They usually
came home once a year and saved me
the trouble. My wife traveled consid
erably, considering, and one of my
daughters has been to Europe, but I
always got along fine on the farm.
When I got tired there I would hitch
up and drive to Pittsville, and if the
conversation there didn't suit ^ne I
would drive over to Eldredge, twenty
miles away."

She Cut Off Hair as Cowgirls Do and
Wracked Rooms a la Film
Comedy.
Paterson, N. J.Rose Rossini, fif
teen, of this city, was arraigned before
Judge Klenert in the juvenile court,
charged with incorrigibility. She had
cut off her long brown tresses, and she
explained that cowgirls in the movies
did it and she wanted to be a cowgirl.
**I guess you've got a plain case of
movieitis,'" said the court, "so I am
going to send you to the Florence Crit
tention home until your hair grows
again. Perhaps a stay in the home will
cure you."
"Why, it'll take a year for my hair to
grow back again," cried Rose. "I can't
stay there all that timer'
"It will all depend on your behav-
ior," said the court
Detectives testified that Rose had
wrecked rooms in homes where she had
been employed because she had seen it
done in the movies.
SPEECHLESS A YEAR,
SHE SUDDENLY TALKS
Family of Woman Is Astonished
When She Says, "I Feel
Better Now."
New York.Suddenly regaining the
power of speech she lost through a
stroke of paralysis a year ago, Mrs.
William Cuppinger, thirty years old, of
College Point, N. Y., startled her fam
ily by remarking, "I feel better now."
Her long period of silence had been
broken while she suffered from what
I was believed to be grip. She said
I she first felt a violent snap in her head.
This was followed by a buzzing sensa
I tion which passed away and left her
feeling much better. Finally her speech
came in whispers and then was loud
enough for those at the bedside to hear.
Dr. Harry M. Biffar, her physician,
was greatly astonished at the outcome
of the case, for he never expected that
Mrs. Cuppinger "would ever talk again.
He said he thought the loss of her
speech was due to the rupture of a
blood vessel. A blood clot formed, and
the physician used treatment to dis
solve it

expressman, appeared at the Sedgwick
county courthouse recently to pay his
personal taxes, which amounted to

cent and unworldly girls in the world.

GENERAL OBBEOON.
Their minds never have been contami
nated by any outside influences. They
are brought up aloof from the world.
They never see their sweethearts ex
cept in the presence of the duenna.
That is perfectly right, according to
my ideas. It precludes the possibility
of temptation."
"Pardon me, senora, but were you
courted under those conditions?"
"Yes General Obregon never saw me
alone until after he married me."
"Do you believe General Obregon
eventually will become master of Mex-
ico?"
"I not only hope he will, but I be
lieve he will. I have perfect faith in
my husband's star."
"Did you marry General Obregon be
cause he is a hero who appealed ro
mantically to your imagination?"
"I married him because I loved him,"
replied Senora Obregon simply.
"How long do you think it will be
before he attains supreme power in
Mexico?"
"I cannot even guess."
"Has there been a quarrel between
General Obregon and President Car
ranza?"
"None whatever. There has not been
even the slightest friction. They are
In perfect accord. I have no idea where
that story started."
"Do you believe in suffrage for Mex
ican women?"
"No," was the prompt answer. "I do
jiot disbelieve in it for American wo
taien, for I hardly think Mexican wo
men are ready for it Mexican women
,have their own problems. Suffrage Is
not yet one of them. Perhaps some day
we may want the vote.
"I cannot imagine our gentle Spanish
women fighting for the, ballot as the
janglo-Saxon women do. It is contrary
to their natures. They are gently bred
and nurtured. However, one never can
tell what the turn of the wheel will
bring. Our Mexican women have
plenty of flre and spirit. Some day
they, too, may fight for equality with
men."
i "What are the present problems of
Mexican women?"
"To make their homes beautiful and
attractive, to make their husbands hap
py, to rear their children to be fine men
and women."
"i& not that the duty of women ev
erywhere?"
i "Perhaps, but it is peculiarly the
problem of women of the Spanish
races. They are raised with such a
vastly different point of view regard
ing men than that of the women of the
races of northern climes. Men are to
them superior creatures. That is Span
I Ish tradition. Its shackles bind closely.
"Whether men are our superiors or
not they are at least stronger. Their
position in the social scale is that of
our protectors. They make the home
for us. We beautify it."
"You believe in the home woman in
contradistinction to the woman who
takes part in public affairs?"
"Yes, yet both, I suppose, have their
places in the world."
