Reported Turks Are Crowding
the Russians Near Persian
Frontier.
London, Eng., May 12.—Switching
their attacks from the Verdun region
against the French the Germans have
begun again a rfhaip offensive against
the British lines around Hulluch.
Preceding their movements with,
the heavy bombardments, the Ger
mans launched an infantry attack
against the British lines in the region
of Vermelies, and were successful in
capturing 'first line trenches over a
front of about 500 yards. The British
admit the loss of the position, but
say that parts of them were retaken
in a counter attack.
Around Verdun, the French on the
left bank of the Meuse, have recap­
tured [points of vantage previously
taken from the southeast of Haucourt
by the Germans. Bombardments are
again taking place in the vicinity of
Lemort Homme and Cumierres and
against the French first and second
line trenches on the right bank of the
Meuse, between the Haudremont
Wood and Vaux. A German attack
southeast of Fort Douaumont. was re­
pulsed.
Artillery Actions.
«In the Austronltalian theatre, in­
tense artillery actions are ensuing in
the Coldi Lana zone, and the Italians
have put down two Austrian attempts
at attacks against captured positions
on Mount Cukla.

League to Enforce Peace told of an
interview he had With Sir Edward

Minister said he was wholly in favor
of the plans of the League to enforce
peace. This proposal is that a Lea­

at the close of the War in Europe to
guarantee a lasting peace, by pledg­
ing the use of their joint armed forces,
together with economic pressure
against any signatory nations, which
shall refuse to keep it's agreement to

Support of Big Paving
Project.

Bismarck Commercial Club,
Bismarck, N. D.
THIS COMPANY WILL
SUPPORT AND APPROVE OF
THE PAVING PROJECT.
E. PENNINGTON,
President, hfl., St. P. & S. Ste.,
Marie Ry., Minneapolis,
•J* Minn.
The above wire, received last eve­
ning from President" Pennington of
the Soo Line, places on record the
Capital City's last big property-holder
in favor of Bismarck's big paving pro­
ject. The Soo will be affected by the.
paving district for a distance of sev­
eral block fronting on Broadway, be­
tween the freight and passenger sta­
tion and tho roundhouse. The mat­
ter was explained to President Pen
L'ington in a letter this week, and he
lost no time in telegraphing his en­
dorsement' and a pledge of his sup­
port.
The 'Northern Pacific Railway Co.,
through one of its executives, has
already expressed its approval of the
paiing project, and these two car­
riers. represent as much frontage as
any other property-holders in Bis-
Strang "fdr Paving.
Non-resident owners of Bismarck
real estate are almost a unit in favor
of the big paving project. Most of
these property-holders reside in cities
which have an abundance of good
paving and they have learned to ap­
preciate its value.
P. D. Kendrick, M. D„ writing from
St. Paul this week, says:
"Whatever suits Little, Mckenzie
and the rest of your property-holders
suits me in regards to paving. What
kind of paving do you propose put­
ting down. The right kind of im­
provements makes the cities.
"Fishing is. too good in Minnesota
for me to come up and boss the job."
Mrs. Henry W. Suttle of Long
Beach, Cnl., who is visiting in the
city, and who owns considerable
property here, is very much in favor
of paving for Bismarck. Mrs. Sut­
tle, en.route to the Capital City,
stopped off at Dickinson over Sun­
day. High winds prevailed there,
bad condition, the oiling which they
had received this spring and last
year apparently having very little ef­
fect, so far as dust is concerned. The
general feeling there, Mrs. Suttle
found, is that all of the money which
lias gone into oiling the streets
would have been much better invest­
ed in paving.
Practically every non-resident prop­
erty-holder who has been consulted
on the subject of paving has agreed
that it is the one thing required to
make Bismarck the best city in North
Dakota, and they regard the expense
as Insignificaut in comparison with
the benefits to be derived. This at­
titude upbn the part of owners of a
very considerable amount of vacant
lot property is one of the very best
endorsements of the value of paving.
There is considerable discussion as
to the personnel of the special pav­
ing committee to be named to co­
operate with the city commission. No
definite action has been taken with
regard to the naming of this commis­
sion. The Commercial club announc­
es, however, that this commission will
be composed of men who are known
to be sincerely friendly to the paving
project, who have gone on record as
such in the petitions to be presented
to the city commission, and men in
whose integrity and ability everyone
will have confidence.

GUiding Hand of Non-Partisan
League Ousted as Commis

ORGANIZED THE
"YELLOW SOCIALISTS"
Was Too Raw for the Regular
Members of That
Party.
Spokane, Wash., May :L2.—D. C.
C'oates, editor of the Non-partisan
Leader of Fargo, N. D., and one of
the managers of the non-partisan
campaign in that state, was elected
a city commissioner of Spokane in
1911 on a lion-partisan ticket. No
sooner had he warmed his seat than
lie began to fill the chief positions
with socialists and radicals wii.ii
whom lie had been associated since
coming to Spokane from Wallacc,
Id., 1907. Coates, with the aid of
his political organization was large­
ly instrumental in securing the adop
tion of a city charter in December,
1910, provided for non-partisan city
elections. Local socialists, who
numebered 1000 in voting papulation
of 25,000 were given to understand
that if ever they captured the offices
is would be on a non-partisan basis,
with Coates as the leader. With the
exception of a few middle-of-the-road,
uncompromising socialists, the Coates
following rallied to the support of the
non-partisan city charters, providing
for a commissinon form of govenr
ment. After his election as commis­
sioner the following March, Coates
lost no time in caring for his friends
his first act being the appointment
of his political secretary and cam
paign manager, A. W. Swonson, one
of the biterest socialists of the com
munity, to the chief position of super
intendent of public works at $2,000 a
year. Coates business partner, H. L.
Hughes, also a rank socialist, was
made a member of the charities com­
mission. Rex Meek, secretary of
Coate's campaign, was appointed to
the civil service commission Morris
Welsh..,.Was H¥$e
streets P. Hiott, superintendent of
the asphalt plant, and so on down the
line until nearly 20 places were filled.
So pronounced had become Coate's
tendency toward the appointment of
socialists that it became a standing
joke at the city hall. When the
monthly pay roll from Coate's de­
partment reaoched the city auditor's
office, the clerks were in the habit
of remarking, "We will now call the
roll of tho socialist party."
Distribution of Spoils.
The straight-laced socialists in the
state organization, who did not profit
in Coate's distribution of the spoils,
opposed to Coate's plan of masquerad­
ing as a non-partisan and claiming
to be a dues paying socialist at the
same time. Early in 1912 the state
secretary of the socialists made a
demand that Coates comply with one
of the requirements of the party by
filing his undated resignation as city
commisisoner with the state organi­
zation. Coates declined, saying that
he was electcd as a non-partisan, and
therefore did not come within the
jurisdiction of the socialist party. He
poiiited to his record in the appoint­
ment of socialists and the advocacy
of socialistic fads in the city govern­
ment as evidentc that while a non
partisan in office, he was still a do
vout socialist at heart. The Spokane
local, composed chiefly of Coate's ap­
pointees, attended the state conven
tion at. which Coates' case was con­
sidered, in an effort to retain the
standing of their chiof on the records
of the party. The state organization,
being comuascd ,o{ old-time followers
of the red flag, would acept no ex
planations and voted to oust Coates
from the party. The Spokane so­
cialists' local, fattened on the city pay
rolls, then voted to withdraw from
the party and establish a new state
organization, called the "yellow" so­
cialists, while the old state organi­
zation was known as the "red" so
cialists. This split provoked many
heated sessions, running over months
and attracted much'attention in the
newspapers. The branch was not
healed until toward the enw of Coates'
term, when the olive brach Was held
out by the "reds" and the Spokane
"yellows" again taken back into the
fold. Nearly all of Coates' lieutenants
were taken back into the fold .but
Coates, because of the prominence
given the matter, did not renew his
affiliation at that time.
Disturbing Element.
From the very beginning Coates
proved to be a disturbing element in
the new city government. Bound by
no party platform and answerable to
no one, Coates was at liberty to swing
every freak idea or fake reform that
came to his mind or was suggested by
his tireless lieutenants. Municipal
wood yards, city owned banks, public
laundries, street railways, dance halls,
lighting plants, telephone esystems
were sprung from time to time on an
unsuspecting public through the med­
ium of newspapers friendly to his
cause. 'Many of these things were
shoved up to the city council for a
vote while his paid workers filled the
chairs in the rear and furnished the
applause. Few of Coates' ideas se­
cured endorsement but sufflcced to
give hi mthe publicity that he desired.

The only new faols concerning the

be no further executions until after
parliament had debated John Dillon's

They were james Connelly, one of

It seems extremely probable there

Some regret was expressed today
over the selection -of .Mr. Dillon to
move the resolution in the house of
commons concerning the executions.
.Many of the strongest supporters of
Ireland's cause advanced the belief
that it would have been better had
some less emotional Irish, member

Major George Langhorne and troops
"A" and "B" of 8th Cavalry again
have dashed across the Rio Grande
from Boquilles in an effort to surprise
bandits holding Jesse Demeer, a pris­
oner.
R. Hasbrouck, an assayer, employed
with a Boquilles mining company and
now a government scout, arrived here
today with messages for Captain John
S. Chambers at Marathon. He is said
to have told personal friendB that Col.
Sibley of the Big Bend expeditionary,
force would order Major Langhorne
to reinvade Mexico as it was believed
negotiations for an exchange of pris­
oners between Langhorne and the
bandit had fallen through.
No News of Parley
No news of the long range parley
between Major Langhorne and the
Mexican bandits for the release of
Demeer for the three Mexican bandits
captured recently were available to­
night.
Army members are of the opinion
that if the story of the so-called con­
ference are true, it must result in fail­
ure. Demeer, if alive, must' be res­
cued by force, which must call for a
dash toward the place where the ban­
dits have their rendezvous.

authorities of the killing last night
of Curtis iBayles, an American farm­
er. it was said that three men who
attacked Bayles near his home at
Mercedes came from across the Rio
Grande, or were a part of concerted
outbreaks against Americans in this
section. One American believed to
have been implicated in the killing
of Bayles was a former employe of
the dead man. This Mexican inquir­

today, with the submission of a letter
from Secretary Lansing to the Ger­

pressing the opinion that the Appam

iWashington, iMay 12.—Failure of

policy toward (Mexico.
There waB no evidence among ad­
ministration officials of greatly in­

Wilson left this afternoon for a week­
end trip down Chesapeake bay on
the naval yacht, Mayflower. Secre­
tary Baker went to Atlantic City and
Newark, N". J., and will not return un­

The text of Gen. Scott's report of
his final discussion has not been

Will Remain in Mexico.
iPending new orders from the pres­

Pershing's expedition would remain
in Mexico. 'Meanwhile, mobilisation
of 'National Guardsmen of the border
states and additional regulars to
strengthen the border patrol over the!
1800-mile stretch continues.
Indication of the attitude of some
members of congress toward the sug­
gestion of Gen. Carranza that the ex-'

War department officials lay stress
on the fact that Gen. Funston's or­
ders were unchanged.' /While Gen.
Pershing is now concentrating hih
force along a shortened line, it was
stated positively that he would hurry
south again immediately if he receiv­
ed definite information that Villa or
any considerable number of his band
were within striking range.
Industrial and Financial Prepare
edness as Necessary as
Military.
Atlantic City, N. J., May 12.—Secre­
tary of War Baker, in an address 'be­
fore the annual convention of the
.New Jersey State Bankers' associa­
tion here tonight urged a permanent
adjustment of th nation's affairs with
a view to a threefold mobilization of
its resources in case of war. Indus­
trial and financial preparedness, he
said, were as essential as military
•preparedness. His only reference to
the Mexican situation was that a "so­
lution of the problem" appeared near
at hand.
The preparedness sentiment, said
Secretary Baker, which is now sweep­
ing th land and sending both men and
women to military and naval training
camps, is reaching into other fields.
and the concentration of these forces
would be secured as readily as those
of the army and navy. He predicted
that congress, now busy with reor­
ganization features of the prepared­
ness program, would be busy with
other industrial and economical ne­
cessities of the land.
Country Dislikes War.
Mr. Baker said there was cause for
profound satisfaction in the fact that
out of the many opinions expressed
regarding the attitude the adminis­
tration would take on international
questions as affected by the European
war, "there has never appeared eri
dence that this country accepts tJ»£"'
philosophy that war is a good or nec­
essary thing."
Pierre Jay of tNew York, another
speaker, explained the new check «ot -fV
lecting system that Shortly will
placed in operation by the federal re- pfjg,
serve board. The new system,
said, while depriving the banks o£
enormous revenues in collection fees*
would turn back to the smallest city v'
bank accounts which merchants mw
kept in the largest citles in border, to
save the fees. .'":""
