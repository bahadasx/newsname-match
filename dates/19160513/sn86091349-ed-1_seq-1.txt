Comet Claims
Still in Court
The suit brought last week hy Dr.
T. O. Duckwarth ? to enjoin' C. 'E.
Moulton and others from shipping
ore from the Thanksgiving and oth
er lode mining claims In the Comet
district, was . .brought to a sudden
end Tuesday, when Judge Horsey or
' tiered he injunction dissolved.
' This action was precipitated - by
the withdrawal of Elliot Larson and
J. A. Nesbitt from the plaintiff's
bond. Larson notified the court last
Monday morning that - he did. not
desire to continue as a surety,, and
Nesbitt took like action Tuesday
morning. - :
, Judge Horsoy gave Duckworth un
til 5 o'clock.and later until 7 o'clock,
Tuesday evening to produce.. other
sureties; failing in this, the Judge
could take no other alternative- but
to order the injunction dissolved.
Moulton and associates took im
mediate steps to resume operations
at the property and to ship the ore
temporarily tied up at Newman's
ranch. "
An then came the second case.
Wednesday, upon depositing $500 in
cash in the bank, J. A. Nesbitt again
consented to act as a bondsman; P.
A Delmue attached his name as the
second surety. Whereupon Judge
Horsey granted an application for
a second injunction, returnable yes
terday morning. Service was obtain
ed on C. B. Moulton, Chaa. Schodde
and Fred Stephenson Thursday. In
the meantime, the ore hauled to
Newman's ranch was shipped to the
Salt Lake smelters, too soon to be
caught by the second enjoinment.
T:e case will probably, come be .
for the court today for final ad
justment. CREEKS CLOSED HY

C1IEELITE BELT NORTH
AS FAR AS CHERRY
REEK
Considerable excitement was occa
sioned at Cherry Creek last week
by the discovery of good scheelite
ore on the Chance mine, a patented
property which has not been oper
ated in almost thirty years. The dis-
overy was made on the old dump,
as originally reported, hut upon a
separate vein of quartz near the old
workings. Many specimens of pure
rytalized white scheelite have
been brought In to town, which are
is rich as any heretofore found In
the eastern part of the county. The
title to the old Chance mine is held
by the estate of the late Peter Can
non, one-half Interest; the estate of
the late Nell Munro, one-quarter In
terest; and M. B. Garaghan, one-
quarter interest. Since the discov
ery was made Austin Cannon, a son
of the late Peter Cannon, who is a
practical miner, has been engaged
to manage the property, and Is now
busy with a force of men in its de
velopment.
I lie discovery is considered of
great importance to the Cherrv
eek district, as it proves that the
scheelite deposits are not confined
to tue immediate vicinity of the
strike made by the Nelson brothers
last fall, who sold their holdings to
the American Smelting company of
Salt Lake, which is now making reg
ular shipments of ore. Ely Record.
PLAN STARTING WORK

The Record learns from John R.

sumed at the main shaft and work
ings at the Mendha mine about ti e
first of June. Meanwhile ore will bo
shipped from the Hamburg property
from which four cars have been dis
patched since about a month ago.

NEVADA
BY MISS LOTTIE DAVIN
Hemmed in by rugged mountains
In our dear old sagebrush state; ,
The one that stands from all the
rest,
With ever a welcome gate.
II
The gate stands open always,
' Bidding people make their
home;
And settle down in tttls loved spot
And never more to roam.
Ill
Birds are singing sweetly,
Trees and flowers are in bloom;
Where everyone is happy
An nowhere is there gloom,
v IV
And very, very, seldom
Has it ever had disease, -And
in this pur? and healthy (
climate
With the cool, fresh, mountain
breeze.
V
The state is rich in mining,
In which it ranks the third;
Among the large surrounding
. states
It is the leading word.
VI
Oh, how I wish to watch the sunset
Behind lite purple hill,
And watch the moon and stars
come out;
When everything is still.
VII
It's cool and sparkling witters,
And canyons, rock-ridged and
green ;
Are two of the beauties of the
state, s
And over to be seen.
VIII
Here through Caiente, runt
The Salt Lake Route,
With a very nice illtlo depot
Clean and neat throughout.

It keeps you stepping sideways
As they rush to and fro.
Well, I guess I will ihse dear

Rut one thing I have to say,
It si growing, and grow l is, right

And will be a great city some
day.
