make the animals good hunters.
Dates of the 1916 State Pair
are November loth to 18th in
clusive. These dates were select
ed because of the general elec

Displaying a free gold speci
men weighing one and one half
ounces and valued at about $20,
W. H. Enderton, supet intendent
of the Ea Portuna mines, de
clared yesterday that he has
discovered the greatest, gold-bo
nanza in the history of Yuma
county, and that the palmy days
of tha La Portuna, when that
company was shipping gold ore
to the value of about SfJO.OOO per
month, had reappeared like a
ghost in the night.
What is probably the most im
portant gold discovery made in
this section for many years was
made a few days ago about 25
miles south of Ajo, in Yuma
county. The discovery is an old
mine and is said by the Indians
to be the Eost Frenchman that i
so many prospectors have been
looking for in years past. There
is a very large gold ledge ex
posed on the property and for a
distance of 3,000 feet on the sur
face shows free gold in abund
ance. Petitions aie circulating to
secure sufficient signatures to
place prohibitionist candidates
hi the field in the movement
for a state ticket. Those behind
the movement hope to get full
legislative tickets in everyone of
the counties of the state. They
want the law to be as severe as
the Idaho law, which forbids
even the possession of beer, wine
or ardent spirits in any form,
Their desire is to make a straight

Attracted by news of the gold
strike near Gold Basin, about 50
miles northwest of Hackberry,
automobile parties from all parts
of the couutry are passing
through Haekhei-ry daily to the
scene of the discovery. Reports
brought back are very favorable.
Parties were out a few days ago
for the purpose of looking the
ground over with a view of
selecting a townsite. Claims
have been located for the dis
tance of two miles in almost
every direction from the main
strike. Miner.

For More Good Roads.
Getting together for good
roads and more roads in Arizona
is to be the slogan of the road
conference called for Phoenix,
May 15 and 10.
The annual meeting of the
State Good Roads Association is
always an affair of great interest,
and this year the addition of the
Arizona highway engineers will
make the session still more im
portant. Hon. Lamar Cobb, state
engineer, as well as county en
gineers from all parts of Ariz
ona are now at work on papers
covering road building in their
respective parts of the state.
Representatives from Texas,
California and New Mexico have
been invited to attend.' The
mayor of Phoenix will welcome
the delegates on behalf of the
capital city, and the governor
of Arizona will be asked to add
a word of greeting.
'"Surface Treatment of Cali
che Roads," "Yuma County
Road Construction," "Bridge
Building iu Apache County,"
"The Need for Permanent Brid
ges," "Desirable. Features of
Highway Laws," are a few of
the important subjects planned
for discussion. A complete pro
gram will be issued in a few
days.
Boards of supervisors, cities
and towns and all commercial
organizations are untitled to re
presentation at the conference.
Barge delegations already have
been appointed by several coun
ties and prominent speakers
from several parts of Arizona
have promised to attend. Ari
zona will give two full days to
discussion of road topics and
May 13 and 10 will be notable in
the story of road building in
Arizona.
Republican Delegates to Chicago.
The Tucson Citizen of May 8th
says:
That Arizona's six delegates
to the Republican National Con
vention will cast their ballot for
Charles Evan Hughes was in
dicated by a poll of the delegate.-?.
Press reports have previously
stated that the old stand pat
leaders won the convention.
This is not the case. The six
delegates while for Justice
Hughes are not anti-Roosevelt.'
It is true that Tom Molly and
Lorenzo Hubbell, two pronounc
ed Roosevelt men, were defeated
but this svas because the district
ing plan was adopted and not
because they were Roosevelt
men.
The delegation held a meeting
Saturday night and selected
Judge Edward Kent of Phoenix,
chairman of the delegation.
John B. Wright was chosen sec
retary, it was decided to meet
at Chicago Monday, .June 5th.

friend of Roosevelt and served
under him for four years- as
Chief Justice of Arizona, having
been appointed first by Pre
sident Roosevelt.

YEARLINGS BRING $31. OO.
Sherman Rhinehart of Du
quesne has been signing up con
tracts this week for the purchase
of cattle for Rhinehart it Capps,
for June delivery. The prices
range from $31 for all over eight
months old up to $41 or So2 for
II year-olds. Among the cattle
men who have signed with Mr.
Rhinehart or who probably will
within the next Jew days are:
Parker Bros., Bud Baldwin,
Pete Bergier, Kunde estate,
Clyde McPhearson, Ernest Best,
Richard Farrell, Gatlin Bros.,
and C. C. Chapman. The price of
$31 for yearlings is not quite as
high as last year, when some of
the growers succeeded in getting
s;j, but it is regarded as a very
good price; indeed some of the
oldtime cattlemen say that when
a few years ago bawlers were
bringing only SI- or $13 a piece
they thought they were making
about all the money possible out
of the cow business. Patagonia.
