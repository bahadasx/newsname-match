BRITISH ESTIMATE: OF ,
r V GERMAN PEACE OVERTURES
Lord Cecil Roberts Says They Do Not
Offer a Basis for Negotiations.
London, May 12, 6.35 p. m. "The
last peace overtures said to be of Ger
man origin, while not as insolent and
impossible as previous statements on
the same subject, certainly do not yet
offer a basis for negotiations," said
Lord Robert Cecil, minister of' war
trade, in a discussion with the Asso
ciated Press of the last and reputed
German peace terms. .Lord Robert
continued:
"We have never received, either of
ficially or unofficially, any direct peace
suggestions ; from Germany and the
only indirect overtures we are aware
of appear in the speech of Chancel
lor Von' Bethmann-Hollweg and the
recent German note to America. We
would not think of discussing or even
considering any overture without con
sulting our allies.. No formal or in
formal conference' for this purpose
fever has taken place.
"In diplomatic procedure a ; neutral
is hardly likely to make any sugges
tion of peace terms unless certain
they are acceptable to the recipient.
"If Germany should decide to ap
proach us through the medium of the
United States, the latter would have
to use its own judgment as to whether
or not to deliver the request."
While disclaiming any knowledge of
the internal condition of Germany,
Lord Robert declared that the increas
ing reports of peace overtures indicate
there is some truth to the stories that
the central powers are in- desperate
straits. .-
SUFFICIENT EXECUTIONS
OF IRISH INSURECTIONISTS
To Show Government's Determination
to Stamp Out Treason.
Dublin." May 12, via London, May 13,
12.35 a, m. The opinion that sufficient
executions have been carried out - in
connection with the recent revolt to
show the government's determination
to stamp out treason is gathering
strength in all circles in Dpblin. . All
leaders of the uprising liave been
shot and many of their followers
have been punished with imprison
ment. -
The correspondent of The .Associat
ed Press has made searching inauirv
among the various classes of society,
including civil officials, business men
and workmen of all grades, and found
a striking unanimitv in the view that
the -government will he faced with a
very serious disaffection, even among
me nimeno loyai nationalists, should
executions continue.
Arrests and deportations are also
arousing antipathy, especially in cases
where persons were arrested merely

roofs of their houses,. ' often without
the knowledge of the -occupants. It is
assenea mat no I ewer than ten mu

whether they were jailed, deported or
Killed in tne ngaung is unknown.

final, report to the department of jus
tice 1 adverse to the merger on April

yet whether he should begin proceed
ings against tne .parties to it. .

Mr. Brandeis was employed by the
commission not to represent the ship
pers, but the public, in seeing that all

sented. He . said- he would have re
garded him as failing in his duty if

er by the conference. The report was
offered to the main committee this
afternoon and after an acrimonious
discussion action was deferred until
Monday.
By. a vote of 10 to 8 the sub-committee
recommended the elimination
from the book of discipline of the
clause prohibiting these amusements
and offered as a substitute an addi
tional paragraph in which warning is
maae against tne diversions. The ef
fect of the proposed change is to re
move the absolute prohibition, but to
place - the church on record as still
strongly opposed to these forms of
amusement. A , minority report was
submitted advising the retention of
the paragraph as it now stands.

During the Military Discussion at El Paso.
Washington. May IS. Pending new
orders from the president. It was plain
at the war department today that Gen
eral Pershing s expedition would re
main in Mexico watching developments
beyond the border. Meanwtoite mobili
zation continues of national guardsmen
trom tne border states and ot addi
tional regulars to strengthen the bor
der patrol at points along the 1,800
mile stretch not protected by the ex
pedition. If raiding is renewed, addi
tional etaite troops will be called out
for border duty, and " wherever the
bandits leave a hot trail the army will
not hesitate to pursue them into Mex

Opposition to Withdrawal of Troops.
An indication of the attitude of some
members of congress toward the sug
gestion of General Carranza- that the
American expedition be recalled came
in the senate today when Senator
Lewis declared he believed the major
ity of the senate never would vote for
withdrawal until the murderers of
Americans had been punished. The
Illinois senator spoke in reply to a
suggestion by Senator Kenyon that
nothing adequate was being done to
safeguard the soldiers now in Mexico.
Senator Lewis declared every possible
precaution was toeing taken by the war
department.
Neither Secretary Lansing; nor Ell-
seo Arredondo. Carranza's ambassador.
designate, took any step during the day
toward renewing diplomatic discussion
of the points that arose during the
military conference.
Funston' Orders Unchanged. -
War department officials laid stress
on the fact that General Fnnston's
orders were unchanged. While General
Pershing.-now is- -concentrating his

PREMIER ASQUITH'S
VISIT TO DUBLIN
Hailed by His Supporters as a Stroke
of Genius.
London, May 12. 1U2 n. m. Pre
mier Asquith's sudden resolve to go
to Dublin, which was hailed by his
supporters as a stroke of genius, has
naa tne effect of assuaging political
passions. Parliament does not meet
Fridays and the fact that there was
no session today - helped to bring
about a day of calm, in strange con
trast to yesterday's sensations.
The only new fact concerning the
situation in Ireland is that two other
leaders in the rebellion, whose execu
tion was delayed by Premier As
quith's undertaking that there would
be no further executions until after
parliament had debated John Dillon's
motion, have been put to death. They
were James Connolly, one of the
signers of- the proclamation of the
Irish republic, and John MoDermott.
It seems extremely probable that
there will now be no more executions.
Much regret is expressed by influen
tial jinerai newspapers that the eov
ernment failed to stop the execution
of Messrs. Connolly. and MoDermott.
The Manchester Guardian and the
Nation contend that a commutation of
these sentences would have been not
only clemency but policy. -
