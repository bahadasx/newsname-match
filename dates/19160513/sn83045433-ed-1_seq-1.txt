BRITISH CASE
TO BE RESTED!
State Department Will Send
No Further Notes Con
cerning Blockade.
ACTION DUE TO DESIRE
TO IGNORE GERMAN PLAN
Secretary of Statte Lansing .said Yes
terday tha t no0 further repr esentations
would be sent to Great Britain for the
present concerning the British blockade.
The decision of the department Is based
on the so-called conditional clauses of
the Gorman submarine note. By some
thesqe have been interpreted to mean that
the maintenance of the newly announced
submarine policy is contingent upon the
United States gaining rancessions from
Great Britain mn the operation of Its
blockade of Germany.
Secretary Lansing auithorized this
.statement:
"In view of the apparent conditions
contained in the German note it is very
difficult to proceed at the present time
with reference to England."
The inference generally drawn from
this statement is that the United States
could not now proceed againist Great
Britain without appearing to be forced
into that course by Germany.
It was stated that no action against
Great Britain would be taken until the
conditions outlined by Germany were re
moved. it was explained that this might
be brought about by an affrmative state
ment by the German government, or by
waiting a sufficient length of time to seel

IN LETTER TO LEAGUE
Dy The %um News %ersiee.)
Oyster Bay N. Y., May 11 -Thomas A.
Edison has come out for Col. Roosevelt
for President.
He has expressed his ophidon of the
Colonel's fitness in vigorous terms, and,
in the letter In which he makes his
views known and which he has sent to
the Roosevelt Non-partisan League, he
declares that Col. Roosevelt is the only
man to be considered at thbi time.
Mr. Edison's conviction is significant in
the light of his connection with the Wil
son administration as chairman of the
naval consulting board, inaugurated by
Secretary of the Navy Daniels and his4
close friendship for Henry Ford, advo
cate of pacificism.
The letter to Guy Ferguson, secretary
of the league, follows:
"Answering your questins as to my
views of Col. Roosevelt for our next
President, I would say that I believe he
Is absolutely the only man that should
be considered at this crucial period.
"He has more real statesmanship, a
better grasp of the most important needs
of this country, and greater executive
ability to handle the big international
problems that will arise at the close of
the war than all the other proposed can
dldates put together.
"His energy, capa'ity, and vast exper

great patriotism and his intense Ameri
