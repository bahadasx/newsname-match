JOHN R. BENNETT
DIED LAST NIGHT
Well Known Contractor Was
| Victim of Stroke of
Paralysis.
I John R. Bennett/prominent contrac
tor and business raan and for many
years a resident of the city died last
night at nine o'clock at his home on
Mason and Jackson street after a sev
eral days illness. On Monday Mr. Ben
nett was stricken with paralysis, the
attack following a period of several
months when his condition was giving
him and his family grave concern.
While in a semi-unconscious condition
from the first, it was thought that he
recognized members of his family but
was unable to converse with them,
Tuesday night however he became
wholly unconscious and continued so
to the end. Members of the family in
cluding his only child, Miss Amelia
Bennett, who attends school in Phila
delphia, and his uncle James Bennett,
of Greensburg, Pa., were summoned ar
riving here on Tuesday and Wednesday
and had remained at his bed side.
Mr. Bennett was aged 45 years and
was a son of the late Patrick M. ana
Mrs. Amelia Barrows Bennett. He was
born at Sabilleville, Frederick county.
Md., June 21, 1871, and was the only
child of his parents. The family
moved to this city when the Fairmont,
Morgantown and Pittsburg railroad,
now the B. & 0. was constructed, the
ten miles of the road reaching out from
Fairmont, being constructed by Pat
rick Bennett who was also a promi
nent contractor. Mr. Bennett died a
number of years ago in this city.
The son, John R. Bennett, worked
with his father in the contracting bus
isness and after his father's death
continued the business successfully.
Much of his work has been In Penn
sylvania on railroad and coke oven
construction. Mr. Bennett was united
in marriage with Miss Sadie Conner,
of Stewart, 0., who survives him with
one child, Miss Amelia Bennett.
The serious illness of Mr. Bennett
followed by his death haB caused deep
regret in the community where hia
work as a citizen was recognised. The
deepest sympathy prevails for the wife,
daughter and mother. Funeral serv
ices are announced to be held on Mon
day morning at 9 o'clock from St Pe
ter's Catholic church and interment
will be made In the Holy Cross cemt
tery by Undertaker R. C. Jones
This is the day of those who bravely bore us
In pain and travail only women know,
The day of those who toil and suffer for us
Always with eyes ashine and hearts aglow,
Who find great wisdom in our childish prattle
Who think us always more than common clay
Yet, if the need comes, send us forth to battle
With a whimper?this is Mother's Day!
How shall we speak or sing their perfect splendor
Of sacrifice, their deep abiding faith,
Their selfless love, unwavering and tender
That seeks to guard us free of wound or scathe?
How they have dreamed for us and planned and striven,
Soothed us in failure, praised us in success,
Waited, and yearned, enduredfcnd given, given
More than we know and more than we can guess.
This is the day of those whose love is endless,
And will not falter though our fortunes fall,
Who, though we should be outcast, broken, friendless
Across a weary world would hear our call,
Captains and kings pass on with their endeavor,
Races and nations rise and die away,
But Mother Love endures and lives forever,
Mother of all of us?this is YOUR DAY!
Here's an Easy Way to Obtain
Some of the Good Things of Life
One of the tangible evidences of this
new era of prosperity is the West Vir
ginian 7,000 Club." Through the dis
tribution of $3,200 In extraordinary
prizes among thoBe who enter and be
come active members of the club, the
West Virginian has paved the way for
each and every man and woman of(
Fairmont and vicinity to secure a, gen
erous share of the large amount of
money which has been put aside to
further our efforts in ever-increasing
fields of circulation.
It is a profit sharing plan without a
peer. Profit-sharing these days is gen
erally connected with coupons, or trad
ing stamps, or Henry Ford. But the
"7,000 Club" is like none of these?it
is refreshingly different.
By filling out the nomination blank
which you will find elsewhere in this
issue you will become a member ot the
club and entitled to participate in the
distribution of prizes. The prizes will
be distributed according to the number
ot votes secured by the club-members,
and the nomination blank alone gives
you 5,000 votes as a starter.
The first grand prize is an Overland
Touring car. Seven passenger, six
cylinder, selling at $1145. A car of i

Woman's Club to Meet Next Monday,
The members of the Woman's Club
will meet at the Baltimore and Ohio
station Monday afternoon at 4 o'clock
for the purpose of visiting the govern
ment's Safety First Train which will
be in the city all of that day. A formal
Invitation was tendored to the club to
visit the train and it has been accent
ed
sterling worth, and a car for you, your
sons or daughters.
Two-high grade pianos will be given
to t.he club members who stand second i
and third when the gong rings at the
close of the race.
To make the race more interesting!
the territory included in the contest!
has been divided into two districts, j
Fairmont has been made district No 1
and all territory outside. District No.
2.
Under this plan there will be equiv-1
elent prizes awarded in each district.
This ll3t will include two hundred dol
lar Edison talking machines, etc.
Eight down to the very least prize on
the list, they are worth-while working
for.
The beauty of the entire plan is the
fact that instead of the club members
paying dues, they all lend their ef
forts to increasing the circulation ot
the West Virginian. Then every ac
tive member will be paid. There will
be a cash award for everyone who falls
to win a prize, no matter how many
there may be. This takes away all
element of chance. It makes the 7,000
Club a big business proposition, and
if you are a business man or woman
we feel sure that you will be quick
to grasp the opportunity.

JUDGE ROBINSON
AT C.H. TONIGHT
Candidate For Republican
Nomination to Address
Voters.
This evening at S o'clock at the court
house Judge Ira E. Rob'nson will make
an address. Judge Robinson is on ns
pirnnt (or the Republican guberna
torial nomination and as his local fol
lowing is very large his audience to
n.'gtat in all probability will be large.
This will be Judge Robinson's first
visit to Fairmont since the campaign
opened, but the reports from the oth
er towns and cities where he has
spoken indicate that he has much to
say to the voters of the state as a
whole and to the Republican voters in
particular. Moreover he says it in a
way that makes listening to him a
delight.
Up to the present time Marion
county has beon neglected by the
gentlemen seeking state nominaitons.,
Governor White, who seeks the Re-'
publican nomination for United States
senator has been the only one in eith
er party to make a speech here. But
the prospects are that from now out
to the date of the primaries this sec
tion of the state will receive more at
tention at the hands of the candidates
Therefore the careful voter will want
to make it a point to hear what the
first of them has to say.
L G. El CASE
Defendant's Att orneys
Spring Surprise on
Commonwealth.
A surprise attack was made today
In the legal battle for the freedom of
L. G. Race who was convicted in ths
circuit court of aiding and abetting i
James It. Linn iu the misplacement
and abstraction of funds of the Citi
zens Dollar Savings Bank. This sur
prise came when Attorney Harry
Shaw, for the defense, moved to amend
the record In the case to show that
Mr. Race had been absent during the'
taking ot some of the testimony in th6
case. Several affidavits were flted by [
Attorneys Shaw and Meredith, repre-!
senting Mr. Race, in which the fact I
of bis. leaving the court room while I
the witness J. C. Miller was on the'
stand and that a number of questions j
asked Mr. Miller by the states attor-1
neys while Race was absent, was set |
up. These were filed with Circuit
Judge W. S. Haymond.
Race appeared In the circuit court j
this afternoon presumably for the pur-.
pose of being present while the motion
made by his attorneys to set aside the
verdict in the case was argued. The
new motion is under consideration by
Judge Haymond and if granted will
give the defense strong grounds for
the support of the motion to set
aside thu verdict or in the event of an
appeal may cause the case to be dis
missed. A. Tusca Morris aud Walter
Haggerty, attorneys for the state did
not expect an attack on this ground,
they having overlooked the fact that
Race had been excused a few minutes
from the court room by Judge Hay
mond. Attorney Shaw reminded the
court that It is a well established
principle of common law that the de
fendant shall be present during the
hearing of all the evidence in such a
case.
