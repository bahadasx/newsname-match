By Associated Press
Washington, D. C., May 13.—Dis
patch of 1,500 Carranza troops north
ward toward the border in the Big
Bend district of Coahuila, reported in
border advices, was regarded by offi
cials here to-day as possible indication
that the Mexican de facto government
is making renewed efforts to capture
bandits who have raided American
border towns. Reports that the ex
pedition might have a hostile purpose
were not regarded seriously by ad
ministration authorities.
They intimated that the action
tended to strengthen the belief that
American and Mexican military au
thorities at El Paso had reached an
unwritten agreement on co-operation
along the border to prevent further
bandit raids.
The Mexican situation shows no
sign of immediate change here to-day.
President Wilson was cruising down
the Chesapeake bay on the yacht May
flower and did not expect to return
before Sunday or Monday. Secretary
Baker had taken a week-end trip to
Atlantic City and Newark.
Sn Antonio, Texas, May 13.—Two
companies of coast artillery reached
here to-da.\ and pitched camp at Fort
Sam Houston, near the militia en
campment. It was said at headquar
ters that all of the other companies
included in the movement will have
arrived by night, making a total of
seven at this point. Four companies
have been sent to strengthen forces at
El Paso and Marathon.
Major-General Funston will reach
headquarters to-night after an ab
sence of more than two weeks, necessi
tated by the conference at El Taso
with General Obregon, minister of
war of the de l'acto government. He is
expected to outline a program of work
which will place the state troops in
shape for service within two or three
weeks.
Marathon, Texas. May 13. One
company of coast artillery arrived here
from San Antonio. Texas, to-ilay. Part
of it will ro south to join Colonel Fred
erick W. Sibley's expeditionary force,
while the remainder will help garrison
Marathon.
Colonel Sibley expects to have direct
romnmnieation between Hoquillas and
Marathon by Susday night.
/Vo Idea Now of Calling
Pennsylvania Guard
Special io the Telegraph
Atlantic City, N. .T.. May 13. Call
ing out. of the National Guanl of Penn
sylvania for service in Mexico or along
the Rio Grande border is not even con
templated as a remote contingency by
the War Department, Secretary of War
Maker said here last night, lie added
that the situation In Mexico is more
"hopeful" than it has been at any time
for a week. His further statement that
no more State troops are to he called
out Is taken as indicating that the War
Department is confident of its ability
to cope with the situation with the
force now at its disposal.
"Pennsylvania has an excellent Na
tional Guard organization, but I do
not think there will be any need for
us to avail ourselves of their services
at this time," said Mr. Baker.
"It is not now regarded probable that
any more States will be called upon to
put their troops in the field, as the
Mexican situation appears to be well
in hand."

20,000 WOMEN IN LINE
All Walks of Life Represented
by Marchers; Reviewed by
l\ S. Officials
By Associated Press
New York, May 13.—New York's
belief that the nation should prepare
I for war was expressed to-day by
nearly 145,000 men and women march
: ing in one of the greatest processions
ever assembled for the promotion of
an idea.
Twenty abreast, filling the streets
from curb to curb, keeping in step to
the patriotic tunes of two hundred
bands, the parade that began this
morning will last for twelve hours or
longer.
Many business houses are closed
while the city gives itself up to Its
celebration of preparedness day. The
sidewalks from the Battery to Fifty
ninth street, the start and finish of the
parade, are crowded. It is estimated
that at least 1,000,000 persons saw the
demonstration.
Twenty thousand women are in the
pageant. Workers in two hundred
occupations, lawyers and other profes
sional men, city officials and city em
ployes and 10,000 members of the
National Guard and thousands of vet
erans of the Spanish war compose the
long column. The lawyers are led by
I twenty justices of the supreme court.
Sixty-four Divisions
The marchers were divided Into
sixty-four divisions. The hour set for
the start was 9.50 a. m. and it is ex
pected that the last division will not
reach the disbanding point until 10.30
o'clock to-night.
Demands for a place in the parade
so greatly exceeded the time and space
that the promoters were compelled to
reject 60,000 applications. Beginning
at the Rattery. at the southern end
of Manhattan Island, the divisions fell
in line at intervals along Broadway,
("enter and Lafayette streets and Fifth
avenue nearly to the reviewing stand
erected in Madison Square.
General Wood on Stand
There, from a stand containing thou
sands of spectators. Major-General
Leonard Wood, Rear Admiral Na
thaniel R. Usher, commander of the
New York navy yard, and Mayor
Mitcliel reviewed the parade.
The main body of the march'ng
thousands was composed of employes
in shops and stores. In addition divi
sions were composed of representa
ti\cs of the theater and allied arts,
engineers, architect*, clergymen, busi
ness men, bankers and brokers, phy
sicians and surgeons and public
schools.
Girls Prom Stores
In the women's section were teach
ers. stenographers, art students, gtrls
from the department stores, the Ameri
can Woman's League for Self-Defense
and the Women's Preparedness Bat
talion and representatives of various
trades organizations.
Anti-preparedness bodies, such as
the Woman's Peace Party and the
Socialists, endeavored to offset, the pre
paredness spirit by circulation among
the spectators of circulars. Across
Fifth avenue from the reviewing stand
the woman's party hung out a banner
with the inscription:
"There are only 100,000 of you.
You are not the only patriots. Two
million families, 500 000 mine workers
and organized labor of America are
opposed to what you and Wall street
are marching for. Are you sure you
are right?"

hours on one occasion everyone on!
board wore a life belt the entire time.
Arriving with the Ford party In I

HARRISBURG, PA., SATURDAY EVENING, MAY 13, 1916.
The party arrived in Rotterdam
about a week later and remained there
and in Amsterdam for a short time.
"Norway and Sweden, of course,
are anxious to remain neutral and our
party was treated here with the great
est of respect. In Stockholm when we
left the people crowded around the
railway station and sang national
songs.
Many Troops In Holland
"In Denmark, however, much ten
sion is caused by the efforts to pre
vent war with Germany. No public
meetings are held and the least bit of
trouble created tremendous excite
ment, but no troops are to be seen.
In Holland it is almost the opposite.
Three hundred thousand troops are
mobilized. Kach morning the lirst
sound is the bugle call and the clatter
of horses' hoofs, guns are mounted on
boats in the canals of Rotterdam ;.nd
Amsterdam and both cities are strongly
fortified."

WILL STRENGTHEN
SLOPES OF RIVER
FRONT WALL RAMP
Park Department Riprap
Passageway From Park
to Wall
AT MUENCH ST. MONDAY
If Treatment Proves Economi
cal Other Slopes Will Be
Similarly Improved
Work will begin Monday on the
rip-rapping of the ramp on the
River Front slope at Muench street
with a view to determining whether
or not the improvement can be ef
fected at a reasonable cost.
If the job can be completed at a
fairly low figure similar treatment will
be followed at Peffer street and later
at all the passageways leading from
the upper park walks to the River
Front Wall. The ramp at Muench
street is the longest and will prob
ably prove the more costly of any.
From sixty to sixty-five tons of
limestone quarried from the new park
way to the east of the city limits,
will be used for the purpose so that
the actual expenditure in connection
with the work will be limited to labor,
hauling, etc. The plan is to set the
stones into the slopes for a distance
of fifteen feet above the walk and
the treatment will be similar to that
adopted at the pumping station plaza.
By this treatment Commissioner E. Z.
Gross and Assistant Park Superinten
dent Forrer expect to establish a solid
bank of stones on the exposed por
tions of the ramp slopes that will re
sist the action of the water for years
to come.

been planned for Monday, the park

Eighteen Wealthy Women
Believed Strangled by
Hungarian "Bluebeard"
Budapest, May 13.—Further official
investigation into the case of the mod
ern Bluebeard in the village of Cin
kota, who, it developed, was known as
Pela Kiss, shows that the man made a
practice for years, according to the po
lice, of decoying women by marriage
advertisements, obtaining their money
on marriage promises and then mur
dering them.
The police have a record of 18 wo
men with whom Kiss was at various
times associated, eight of whom have
long been "-eported as missing, while
the ten oth*-r« have not yet been found.
11l the house he had occupied were dis
covered packages of love letters from
I all parts of the world, Including the
I United States.
Four of seven sealed leaden cases
found in the dwelling- were opened.
Three contained the bodies of strangled
women, while In the fourth were seven
women's dresses. One was identified
as belonging to a young woman who
had been missing for ten years.
There appears to be no doubt that
Kiss died at Valjevo, Sorbla, as pre
viously reported. Although he rarely
worked, he spent money so generously
that lie was known as "the American
uncle."
