(United rrcs3 staff correspondent.)
The Hague, May 13. Severe punish
ment lins been metoc out to the com
mander of the German submarine which
attached the channel packet Sussex and
caused great loss of life, it is generally
Relieved in Berlin today, though no of
ficial rport of that nature has been
made public
Tho report is based on popular indig
nation at his act in deceiving the Gor
man naval authorities with reg'ird to
the vessel which lie admitted attack
ing. His report, saying thnt the ship
ht torpedoed was not the Sussex was
imlicitly believed until America r'o
soi tod conclusive evide ice ii t lie con
trary. In view of this evidenci the
Germans 'feci that they lit! ve h"'-' hu
ll it'ated. It is not overstrain,? the ruse
tr. say that his decep io.i caused as
much indigation iu Berlin as in Wash
ington, i
Germany, desiriig to avoid a break
with America at all costs, lias taken two
important steps within a fortnight to
improve relations. The submarine con
cessions constituted one step. The quiet
movement to squelch Teuton plotters
and propagandists in the United SStntes
nnd anti-American propagandists in
Germany constituted the other step.
Ambassador Gerard recently received
scores of threats against his life. The
writers were inspired by newspaper in
sinuations that lie "tipped" the Irish
rebellion to Great Britain.
Though Germany has disclaimed re
sponsibility for the German bomb plot
ters in America, Imperial Chauca'lor
Vn Bethmnnn-Hollweg believes that
drastic moves should lie made to con
vince America that Germany has nothj
in to do with those extremists. Con
ferences on this subject have beea in
progress in Berlin for a week.
1 heard for instance that Von Riii-tcli-iii
will be court-martialed if he re
turns to Germany. Though officials will
not voice nay opinion as to the guilt
of the accused bomb plotters they de
cline that the acts of these persons
are without the kaiser's sanction.
Herlin is chiefly worried over the pos
nihility thnt some one may accidental
ly torpedo without warning a merchant
man in the belief that a ti'ousport is be-1
ing attacked and thus precipitate a new,
American crisis. The kaiser and his of
ficials are particularly anxious that sub
marine commanders shall take no
chances of involving Germany and Am
erica in fresh controversies.
If the new o'fficial submarine orders
coiibl be made public they would ci'i
viuce the most skeptical that Germany
is as much concerned as America in jrc
vivitinj future accidents.
fount Veventlow, in the T.;gs 7('-
tung, is pnieticnlly alone in i yini f.-.r
vengeance. Though there is rn occa
sional outburst against President Wil
son nnd the United States tit mo are
probably intended for horn.' consump
tion. Ambassador Gerard won the hearty
praise of Berlin for his cool and force
ful diplomacy in tho U-boat ' crisis.

made luuay by Sirs. John O. Dennis,
widow of the steamer's second officer,
whose corpse was found in a drifting
lifeboat southward of Port. San Luis
by the Pacific mailer City of Para yes
terday. "I have been robbed of my hus
band," said the gTief stricken Mrs.
Dennis. "The Roanoke's interior was
sawed .way to make room for an un
precedented cargo. All day Monday
a gang of carpenters was busy aboard
and my husband told me they were
removing beams, braces and everything
to make more room. He said he did
not believe the Roanoke would get
farther thin San Pedro, aud he prom
ised to quit her there."
It has been admitted that, while in
the passenger service the obi steamer
drew about 19 fet of water, when she
left San Francisco last Monday she
drew 23 feet. Stevedores have de
clared that the steamer was loaded
with great speed and carelessly.
Reports from San Luis said that ax
other lifeboat was seen drifting off
that point, but efforts to find it and
tow it in were unsuccessul.
Federal investigation of the Roa
noke disaster begins in San Francisco
today. The coroner 's inquest over the
five bodies which came ashore in the
lifeboat with the three survivors is
scheduled to commence today in Sin
Luis Obispo. A beach patrol is still
being maintained for the bodies of the
other 45 of 50 victims.
Inspectors of Hulls and Boilers .Tames
Guthrie nnd Joseph P. Dolan handled
the federal probe here. They desired
to get to the bottom of the charges
that the steamer was overloaded, that
the cargo of dynamite, oil and wheat
was carelessly placed aboard her, and
that she started on her voyage to
Valparaiso in an uiiseawortky condition-.
Principal witnesses will be (Quarter

the sole known survivors. They will be
called upon to describe bow the old ves

southward last Tuesday afternoon, how

from Port San Luis. One unidentified

Washington, Mny 13. The acuteness
of the Mexican situation has passed.
General Hugh Scott wired Secretary of
War Baker today. He said that Gen
eral J. J. Pershing has so arranged his
troops that he could clean out the ban
dits in northern Chihuahua, Scott also
reported that no Mexican troops were
in sight of the American communica
tions. Scott expressed the view that General
Alvaro Obregon was now in a oetter po
sition to aid the expedition than if he
had signed the border agreement. Scott
reported that Obregon had promised to
dispose the Carran.istas bo ns to patrol
Parral nnd the region Bouth of Big
Bend, Texas.
While contraction of the American
lines south of Columbus is practically
accomplished, Major Langhorne is ap
parently hot on the trail of the Boquil
las raiders and Carrauzistus are mnrch
ing toward Big Bend, TexaB, with the
avoweiJ intontion of co-operating with
the United States column
If nothing untoward occurs, the ex
pedition hopes for a quick cleanup in
the policing of northern Chihuahua. The
hope of catching Francisco Villa him
self is not grent. The big question now
is, can the Carrnnzistns be checked aft
er they lenrn that the American ex
pedition refuses to withdraw.
Privately, officials said thnt there
might be an outbreak at any time. Gen
eral Hugh Scott is en route to Wash
ington with his information concerning
the situation which will be used for the
guidance of the government iu further
proceedings.
Ambassador Designate Arrcdondo is
expected to undertnke withdrawal nego
tiations soon, but his task is hopeless,

Peace Defense-Force To Be
654,000, Regular Army
175,000 to 220,000
Washington, May 13. A peace do
fenso force of 054,000 men is proposed
in the army bill which the house and
senate conferees reported to both
houses of congress today.
The compromise measure includes all
the provisions the big army advocates
urged except the federal reserve. Both
chairmen urged passage of the bill nnd
action is expected Monday.
The defense force as provided con
sist of 200,000 regulars in peace times
and 428,000 militiamen, 800 for each
senator and representative.
Tho act reserves specific power for
tho government to take over any manu
facturing plant in times of war for the
purpose of making munitions. It ap
points a board consisting of two civil
ians and threo officers named by the
president to investigate the proposition
of the government manufacturing all
munitions. The board must report fey
next New Years.
Agreed on its major details, tho house
and senate conferees today prepared to
submit a final draft of the army bill !
first of ihe great preparedness meas
ures to iMith houses. There were pros
pects of a speedy acceptance.
, The principal features of the bill as
it now stands calls for a regular army
of from 175,000 to 180,000 which may
be expanded to 254,000, with tho militia
as a reserve line, its present powers and
duties changed, a government nitrate
plant, enlarged nir and field artillery
branches, a larger genernl staff, 7.)
hours monthly training in trades for
private and a shorter active service
period.
The measure appropriates $20,000,000
for a government nitrate plant to ex
tract nitrates from the air for muni
tions. The surplus may be sold for
fertilizer. Tho president is empowered
to pick the site for the plant.
No definite monthly hours are fixed
for the training of private soldiers in
trades. Soldiers must lint compete with
civilians for a livelihood, it is niado
plain. '
The terms ot enlistment are fixed
at seven years in either the active or
reserve brunches of the nrmy, but if
competent, soldiers may bo dismissed
at the end of one active year on the
recoiMincndntion of their captains.
The army is to consist of 65 regi
ments on infantry, 25 of cavalry, 21 of
field artillery nnd seven of engineers.
There will bo 30,000 men in the coast
artillery, two mounted battalions of
engineers, 5,733 scouts, fi.toO men in the
quartermaster corps, 7.200 in the med
ical corps, 3,3.S7 iu the signal corps,
8,750 unnssigned to regular posts.
The general staff is increased to ,r2
members and four major generals nrc
added to it. Nine brigadier generals
are added to the line officers, All in
creases will be gradually made over a
period of five years.
Henceforth all militiamen must take
oath to the United States ns well ns to
their individual states, this is the prin
cipal "federalization" step. The oath
requires them to engage in active serv
ice outside the United States if the
president, calls on them to do so.

sermons denouncing the accusations
agninst him as a "frame-up" on the
part of the liquor interests and other

In returning its verdict, the jnry

When Slaughter started to jail with

Slaughter refused a statement. Sev

guards all tho way to the prison door.
As tho grating swung open to admit the,
