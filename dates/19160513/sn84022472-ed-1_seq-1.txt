Dance Halls Where Liquor is Sold Prolific Source
of Vice Finds Investigating Board Recom
mends Drive Against So-Called Private Din-
insr Room Little Immorality in Shops and
Department Stores
The report of the Bridgeport Vice Commission, a body creat
ed by Mayor-Wilson, after Zenas L. Potter, of the Kussell Sage
Foundation, had threatened to expose conditions here, was giv
en to the public today. '
It contain:? si thorough-going consideration of the phenom
ena of, social evil, with a large number of recommendations for
the improvement, of conditions, i " ' '
"-.- It is shown conclusively that the cabarets and dance halls
where liquor is sold are a prolific source of evil. The abolition
of the, private dining room is
. It is shown that the department stores and industrial estab
lishments of Bridgeport are not primarily the source, of social
vice. '' '-- . ','
Many facts are given regarding the presence of 'diseases in
duced by sex immorality. It
cnaniy cases, aiincteu wilii uiese uiseases, uuiiiig six. ixiuiiliis
in 1915, was over $1,700.- , V ,
- With respect to a class of persons
who are abnormal, the commission
says:: s
"In every community, are a group
of degenerate or sexually insane per-'
sons of both sxes who make a prey
of society and who stop at nothing
to gratify their unnatural llusts. We
' recommend that 'such. persons be
treated . asv abnormal afi'd anti-social
members , of society, and their cases
disposed of by, the courts, in accord
ance with the law after diagnosis and
recommendation of the pyschopathio
board, which We hereafter recom
mend.") - - , '
The conclusions of the commission
are summed in the following pages:
We have, tried o steer clear of the
sentimental view that the wrong of
jsex .relations can, be definitely placed
on onesex only, that the . one sex is
culpable and that - the other - is vic
timized.' All thorough investigation
has shown this to be totally untrue.
We have faced the problem of the
vice- of the city with open minds. Be
cause we had a definite investigation
to make and workable recommenda
tions to form, we have kept rigorously
to the one problem of commercialized
vice and its crop of evils.

There are standards of public de

the state define the period of marriage
and iirtereaureeforbid.; cohabitation
outside the; mjarrlae bond; furnish
penalties for fornication . and adultery;
and particularly guard, against all "per
version and bestiality. ' It Is these
aberrations '. of the instinct against
which society must fight constantly..

city of unnatural, immoral, and tin

PLAN TO KEEP GOOD
EMPLOYES WITH FIRM
Head of Concern Believes
Arrangement Will Work
For Efficiency.
In the belief that the longer em
ployes are with the 'company, the
more is the chance that they will
become of great value to the com
pany, the Bullard Machine Tool Co.
has instituted a wage plan that is
expected to be a great success.' v
No maximum will be placed on the
wages that may be earned by good
men, according to the statement of
the company, which follows:
"Skill and proficiency are ithe
actual foundations of low costs of
production not a low hourlv
rate.
"Skill at the machinists trade mav
be acquired by years of application
in any of a thousand shops, but pro
ficiency in the construction of a
highly specialized product, like ours,
can be attained only by long associa
tion with that product, through which
may be developed a knowledge of its
workings and an appreciation of the
exacting -requirements of the con-i
struction of the various details which
enter into it.
"The longer- a man is with us the
better is his work because of his de
velopment in skill and his , greater
knowledge of te special needs in the
Duilding of our machines and, in the
final analysis, that man's work costs
less, even though his hourly wage be
considered high, because ef its super
ior quality and the greater efficiency
with which it has been produced.
Our Maxi-Pay Wage Plan has been
developed from these basic facts. It
recognizes tne value of skill and pro
ficiency and provides suitable reward
for their attainment. It presents a
high mark for the good man to aim at
and opens the doors ei .opportunity for
advancement to all in our employ
even to those who are now unskilled.
'By close personal study of the in
dividuals in oifr., organization, and a
careful -checking of their records,--13.
P. Bullard,. Jr., our president, in con
ference with the ehop executives and
fotemen has grouped the men In six
distinct classes, f oui of which cover
the mechanics, one tne apprentices.
and -one the non-mechanlal and un
skilled members of our foree. Future
advancements will be made the sub
ject of equally careful and fair con
sideration.
"In Class AA. from which will be
recruited our future shop : executives
and foremen, are grouped - the sub
foremen and leaders in charge of
wnrkine eranga of mechanics. The
maximum wage rate is limited only
by ability, proficiency and occupation
while a high minimum of 55 cents
per hour has been set. .
"Class. A. comprised, of . mechanics
of highest skill, forms the basis or
promotion to Class AA and, like it.

FREIGHT EMBARGO
TIGHTENED HERE;
NO RELIEF SEEN
All Less Than Carload Con
. signments Come Under ,
: New Orders.
New Haven, May 13 The following
statement on the embargo was given
out at the offices of the New Haven
Railroad today:
"The embargo committee of the
eastern freight ' accumulation confer
ence has placed an embargo on all less
than carload freight except perishables
and food for human consumption, or
iginating at stations on the New Ha
ven and Central New England Rail
ways when destined to or to be trans
ferred at Bridgeport, New Haven, Wa
terbury, Plainville, Conn., and Provi
dence, R. I. This embargo is neces
sitated by the accumulation of freight
at these points. It becomes effective
midnight, Saturday, May 13.
"The embargo against these con
signees, who have been having diffi
culty unloading their shipments
promptly but who have since taken
away all freight placed for them, has
been lifted." - ,
L. B. Nickerson, local freight agent
for the New Haven road, said today
that the first embargo order was made
necessary by accumulation of freight
due to strikes of the freight handlers.
He said the present accumulation of
freight and consequent embargo ia
jdue to the difficulty in securing freight
handlers and the inefficiency of those
employed. He said the company is
making an effort to induce laborers to
accept employment by arranging a
lodging house for them and seeing to
it that they obtain proper rest and
have food and housing conditions. He
would not attempt to predict how long
the embargo will last but said the
same conditions exist at all railroad
centers in the country.
