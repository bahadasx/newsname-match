A Berlin dispatch is explaining the

BIG REVIVAL
NEARS
fnd
Dr. Thacker Has Sustained
His High Reputation As
An Evangelist.
SPECIAL SUNDAY SERVICE
Meeting Will Close With a
Tabernacle Meeting
4 At Night.
The revival meeting that is being
conducted by tho Westminster church
has been successful in every way.
Dr. J. E. Thacker, of Norfolk, Va.,
one of the best evangelists in the
South, is leading tho meeting, and is
assisted most ably by Mr. James W.
Jelks, chorus leader and soloist
The services have been held in the
tabernacle and have been drawing
large and enthusiastic crowds. Dr.
Thacker is an evangelist of the. high
est class. In his work there is noth
ing of the objectionable features that
are sometimes present in modern
evangelism. His sermons are all dt
rect and to the point, they are illus
trated from the vast fields of literature
and Biblical history, and little of scnt-
imentalismor emotionalism is allowed
to creep in.
In style he is logical at all times,
His sermons show a careful prepara
tion, and, are presented in such
pleasing and orderly form that they
are easy to follow and hard to forget.
His address is most pleas(ng. Of ex
cellent intellect, thorough education,
and polish?d'Inifspeech find manners,
he atall times-presents an epitome of
a christian gentleman. '
Mr. James W. Jelks, the soloist and
chorus leader, has all the qualities
that render him a valuable and proper
co-worker of Dr. Thacker. He poss
esses a delightful personality, is a
good mixer, and has made many
friends during his stay in this city.
He is a combination of wit, enthusi
asm, ability and concentration that
make him especially capable and valU'
able. He has a highly cultivated, at
tractive voice, and usually rewards
his audience with two solos each
night.
Through his efficient leadership he
has built up a choir of exceptional
merit. Most of the best voices of the
city are represented at each meeting.
The results of the meeting, which
are now almost concluded have been
most encouraging. Over 600 profes
sions and reconsecrations have been
made. In view of the fact of a recent
revival, this is indeed a wonderful
record, and speaks for the ability of
those in charge.
There will be no services to-night,
On tomorrow there will bo double
services a special men and boys
meeting in the afternoon at 3:00
o'clock, and the regular and
concluding meeting Sunday night
at 7:45. The afternoon subject
will be, "What Constitutes a
Fool." As these two meetings are
the final ones of the revival, a record
crowd is expected.

Relations to Diplomats.
GEN. CARRANZA BLAMED
First Chief Refused To Lend
Assent-Does Not Mean
Rupture in Relations.
El Paso, Tex., May 12. After al
most two weeks of discussion the
conference of Gens. Hugh L. Scott,
Frederick Funston and Gen. Alvaro
Obregon, Mexican minister of war,
over American troop disposition in
Mexico, came to an end Thursday
night without any agreement being
reached.
The whole matter was referred
back to the American and de 'facto
governments to be settled through
diplomatic channels. To-night the
situation is almost exactly where it ;
stood before tho conferences began.
The Mexican government still insists
on the withdrawal of Gen. Pershing's
column upon a certain date and wants
that date to come quickly. It is
known that Gen. Obregon has been
willing to make concessions to reach
an agreement with the American con
ferees. He has been overruled, how
ever, by the first chief, Gen. Carran-
za and his advisers. After practically
conceding the demands of the Ameri
can conferees, he was compelled to
reverse his attitude.
ANOTHER RAID ATTEMPTED.
Marthon, Tex., May 12., Mexican
bandits again crossed into American
territory last night and attacked'civil-
ians and soldiers. The raid was made
four miles north of Boquillas at an
ore terminal station and directly be
hind Maj. Langhorne's column which
up to that time had not crossed into
Mexico. After a short skirmish the
bandits fled.
WITTY TRIAL MOM.
Claud Witty, the negro who killed
a white boy named Ezra Samples in
Hopkins county and has been in jail
here for safe keeping, was taken to
Madisonville for trial Tuesday, but
the trial was set over to next Monday
and Witty was brought back here un
til that time. A Madisonville dispatch
says Attorney John Feland will de
fend Witty.

ARMLESS WONDER HITS A MAN.
Frank E. Fithen, the "armless won
der" who was here recently, ran over
a man in Louisville while doing stunts
with an automobile. Irvin Lawson,
aged 19, was thrown by his mule that
scared at Fithcn's automobile and
dragged him in front of the machine
as he was clinging to the bridle. Law
son may not die from his hurts. The
armless driver of the motor car was
accompanied by his wife. He claims
he was powerless to avert the acci
dent, as the victim fell just in front of
the wheels.

Athenaeum Banquet in Many

Success.
NOTHING BUT PLEASURE
Attendance Slightly Under
Some That Have Been
Held.
In spite of the absence of eight of
the 30 members, due to illness or un
avoidable absence, the thirteenth
annual banquet of the Athenaeum
was in some respects the best one yet
held.
The weather was ideal, the arrange
ments faultless in detail, the menu ex
cellent and well served and the
program one of the best rendered at
any of the past functions. Messrs.
Noe & Son were ahead of time in the
dining room arrangements and the
only hitch was a slight delay due to
late arrivals. There were two long
tables running north and south. The
speakers were in prominent seats at
the ends of the tables.
President Frank Rives, the toast-
master, occupied a seat at the south
end of the table on the east side of
the dining room. Covers were laid
for 87 and nearly every chair was oc
cupied with a brilliant assemblage of
ladies and gentlemen. They entered
the dining room at 8:35 and the.jnvo
cation was pronounced by Rev; J. N.,
Jessup.

fully decorated with roses, carnations,
lilies and ferns and Blakemore's
orchestra played at intervals.
The speaking program began at
9:40 and was concluded at 11:30, ex
actly on time. Every moment of the
time was filled with pleasure. Presi
dent Rives presided gracefully and
after a short review of the society's
past history presented the first speak
er. His" introductions in each case
were brief, appropriate and happy.

Infantry Action at Verdun
Gives Way to Artillery
Air Chief Killed.
London, May 12. The infantry ac
tions in the region of Verdun have
again given way to artillery bombard
ments, the most violent of which was
directed against the French positions
in the Caillette wood and their second
lines on the right bank of the Mcuse.
Bombardments also have taken place
along the front held by the Belgians,
and mining operations and artillery
duels have predominated on the
British front A severe artillery duel
is in progress around the Hohcnzoll
crn redoubt between the British and
Germans. The British and Germans
on the western line are keeping up
mutual bombardments at various
points and similar conditions prevail
in the fighting between the Austrian
and Italians in the mountainous re
gion of the Austro-Italian front.
Constantinople reports that in the
Caucasus region around Mount Kope,
the Turks, in an attack drove the
Russians from positions about 9i
miles in extent and forced them to re

doing of it involved a fight of twelve
hours against a forco that outnum

his dead and the saving of his wound

and, more important still, sticking to
it until relief came and the attacking
