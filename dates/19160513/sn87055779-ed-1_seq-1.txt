Stern Measures of British in
Punishing Sinn Feiners
Causing Resentment.
Intrrmtiunal News Service:
UiNDON. May in. A review of
the British troops in Dublin was
held today by Con. Sir John Max
well, the commander-in-chief in Ire
land. The soldiers were also reviewed by
Premier As,uith, who went to the
Irish capital to confer with officials
and secure at first hand information
relative to the responsibility for the
uprising.
With lß leaders of tho rebels exe
cuted, belief was expressed today
that there would be no more death
sentences carried out. It Is also likely
that a proclamation will be issued
within the next few days restoring
civil law in Ireland, there is con
siderable high feeling prevailing in
southern and western Irish counties
over the stern measures sanctioned
by the British government and it
will probably be some time before
this is eliminated entirely, but mem
bers of the goernmen! strongly de
fend the drastic policy which was
put into effect.
Those who have paid with their
liv for the part they took in th
uprising are: P. II. Pearce, the "pro
isional president of tbe republic;"
James Connolly, comman lor-in-chief
of the Sinn Fein army: John
McPermott. Thomas J. Clarke. John
J. MacDonaugh. Joseph Plunkett.

chael O'Hanrahan. William Pearce.

Thomas Kent and Sheehy keffing
ton. Those executed included all th
seven men who signed the procla
mation declaring Ireland sfree and
independent of British rule.
Powerful liberal papers, includ
ing the Manchester Guardian, criti
cize the -o eminent for the wide
spread executions in Ireland. Espe
cially severe was the censure for al
lowing Connolly to be put to death.
Connolly was wounded in the fight
ing in the streets of Dublin and he
bore one of his legs in splints as he
faced the filing siuad.

LANSING'S STATEMENT
CAUSES UNEASINESS
IN GERMAN EMPIRE
Internatioual News Service:
AMSTERDAM, May in. Consid
erable uneasiness has been muted
throughout Germany by the state
ment of Sec'y Lansing relative to
Anglo-American relations. Tbe
Eansing statement, which dealt with
Germany's demand that tae United
States compel England to lighten
her blockade, was issued after Pres't
Wilson forwarded his note accept
ing the submarine concessions of
Germany. Parts of the statements
were regarded as obscure and the
Vos.sische Zeitung applied to Jnme
V. Gerard, tho United States am
bassador to Berlin, for an utticial in
terpretation. Mr. Gerard in reply stated that
the allusion to a treaty evidently
referred to an arbitration treaty,
which the. United States concluded
in 1914 with 21 nations, including
Great Britain.
The Cologne Gazette expressed
bitter disappointment that America
was disposed to await the end of the
war before pressing England for
certain explanations.

HE ft EIN". May in. Dr. Clemens
Pelbrueek. ice chancellor and min
ister of the interior, has resigned on
account of ill health, it was an
nounced today. He is stated to be
suffering from diabetes.
It is recalled that when Field
Marshall von Moltke was succeeded
by Gen. von Falkenhayn as head of
the German general staff, his retire
ment was attributed to ill health.
Dr. Delbrueck has had charge of
the food situation in Germany since
the war began and there have been
many complaints. They refer to his
failure to furnish adequate supplies.
Lack of potatoes has caused much
dissatisfaction with his administra
tion. Germany could produce,
enough potatoes to remedy in large
part the. shortage of meats and !
grains, but it is alleged no effective j
measures were taken to force the j
large land owners to do their share
in raising a large potato crop.

WASHINGTON, M'.y 1.1. Drastic
remedies for the manifold ailments
of the American transportation sys
tem, induced by tho European war,
are in process of preparation by tho
Interstate commerce commission
and the nett few months will see
the most complete readjustment
of rate structures in every part of

tablished. "We are working day and night

Thus, to cure the condition of
congestion of freight cars at eastern

will not be permitted to allow their
poods to remain in ea-stern seaport
warehouses er in cars on sidings and

rental charges for the space occu
pied. The commission feels this will
expedite movement of poods, but
shippers of the west are bitterly
protesting tint they are being made
to bear a lurden unfairly placed

commission believes, also will cure
the western car shortage, doing great
ultimate good.
Shippers ere protesting against
advanced rates on war products, but
the commission is preparing to grant

have funds with which to pay the
