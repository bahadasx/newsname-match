The belief is based largely on the
indignation felt in Germany over the
boat Commander's deception. His
report was Implicitly believed until
the American government presented
conclusive evidence showing that the
channel packet was torpedoed. In
Tie of this evidence, Germans feel
that they were put in a rather humili

the case to saythat,the submarine
commander's deception caused as
much indignation in Berlin as it did
in Washington.

BRYAN PREDICTS
crats at the Last
Election.
LINCOLN, Nebr., May 13.—In a
signed editorial that will appear In
the May issue of his paper, W. J. Bry
an says that the only source from
which the democracy may gain
enough recruits to win the presiden
cy this year, is the peace element.
Following a long quotation from the
Chicago Tribune, which pointed out
that Wilson is a minority president,
receiving 1,300,000 votes less than
Taft and Roosevelt combined, Mr. Bry
an says:
It is just as well to look the
facts In the face. The republi
can party if united, can enter
the campaign with a popular ma
jority of 1,300,000 votes on its
side. As a portion of this major
ity 1b made up of large majorities
in a few republican states, our
party's handicap is not quite as
great as it appears, but it is still
enough to compel serious consid
eration.
To the normal republican ad
vantage must be added the dis
affection amohg German and
Irish democrats. Without at
tempting "to decide whether the
president was wise or unwise in
taking the course that alienated
them, the party is confronted
with the fact that this alienation
will cost it a large number of
votes—enough to defeat the par
ty in several close states.
Prom what source can we draw
the number of recruits neces
sary to give the party a fighting
chance? Prom one source and
from one source only, namely, the
peace element of the republican
party we can not dVaw votes
from the war element.

LONDON, May 13.—A large num

'Several government employes were
among the men released. Others in

Premier Asquith planned to con

to their families as soon as possible.
It was reported in Dublin that Pre

the Irish people.
