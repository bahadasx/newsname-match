DEFENSE FORECAST
IN RIGGS BANK CASE
Attorney, for Indicted Officials
Protests Reading of Affidavit
in Court.
WAS NOT PROPERLY FILED,
IS CONTENTION MADE
Challenges the Use of Statement
Upon Which Criminal Proceedings
Are Based.
"Effort by the attorneys for the defense
in the Riggs Bank case to show
that the affidavit on which the; indictjnents
for perjury are based were improperly
filed in court, and thus to
puncture the case of the government,
was forecast at the close of the session
yesterday.
There is no court today. The trial
of <"harles <*. Glover. William .1. Flather
arid Henry M. Flather. officials of the
Riggs Bank, on joint and individual
j nu in men is iui' fijuiv >? m ucfein in
earnest Monday morning at 10 o'clock
in Criminal Division 1 of the District
Supreme Court before Justice Siddons.
The taking of testimony will then be
begun.
While the justice is the guest of
members of the District Bar Association
at a shad bake at Chesapeake
Beach today the jurors are locked up.
They spent the morning in playing
games, and several of "them were
visited by their wives. This afternoon
they are taking a walk in charge of
the bailiffs.
Ten of the jurymen are married. They
are allowed to see their wives in the
presence of a bailiff, and seven have
taken advantage of this privilege.
While they do not take very kindly
to being locked up, and while most of
them are suffering hardship, not only
as to physical comfort, but in their
business interest, during the time they
are thus confined, the jury as a whole
Is in a jovial mood.
Preliminaries Consume Five Days. \
For the last five days the time of the]
court has been given over to selection i
of a jury and the reading by the gov-I
ernment of records in the equity suit |
by the Riggs Bank officials against
Treasury officials, which led up to the
present criminal proceedings.
The defense showed its hand late yesterday
afternoon when Assistant United
States Attorney James B. Archer attempted
to read to the jury the affidavit
of the Riggs officers. Vigorous objection
wa< at once registered by Attorney
William d. Johnson for the defense.
who claimed that this affidavit
was not properly filed with the clerk of
the court, and that it has a "history"
which the defense wishes to have
brought out in court.
"If it please the court," said Mr.
Archer, who had been reading other
papers to the jury, "I will now read
the affidavit of (' Clover, William
J Flather and Henry "
"Wait a minute." exclaimed Mr. John
Holding the famous affidavit in his
hand. Mr. Archer swung around and
faced the challenger for the defense:
*1 em only seeking to introduce this
paper as I have introduced other papers
In the case," he explained. "We merely
wish to show that such a paper was
filed."
"Different Matter," He Suggests.
!
"Hut that is a very different matter," i
said Mr. Johnson. "We object. In the
first place, if :t please the court, this is
the very paper on which the government
relied to prove its perjury
charges, and in regard to which the
r !?-rk of the court could pot give a satisfactory
explanation of how it was
fljed."
Ms tins paper to he presented twice?"
he inquired, turning to the assistant
l.'nited States attorney.
'That is mv understanding. That is
the usuai course."
"Tli is paper," Mr Johnson went on,
"has a history and we are entitled to
have :t brought out. The testimony so
far has not properly connected it with
the case "
"At this stage of the case," said Mr.
Archer, "this paper is not different from
any other paper."
Justice Stddons then questioned the
opposing attorneys as to their respec- '
tive contentions and ruled that "for it I
purposes at this time" the paper had J
J.een sufficiently identified.
Mr. Archer had scarcely begun to i
xea d the title of the affidavit when
court was adjourned until 10 o'clock
tvionday morning.
Supplementary to Challenge.
This argument over the filing of the
affidavit was supplementary to a previous
challenge by Attorney Johnson,
.registered when Frank 11. Cunningham.
in charge of the equity branch of
the office of the clerk of the District
Supreme Court, was sworn.
At that time Mr. Johnson questioned
him regarding how the affidavit in
question came to be filed. Mr. Cunningham
had no recollection of receiving
'hp paper. Mr Johnson suggested
yeste-.-Jay *hat it might be well
to have John A. c. I'aimer, clerk of
Fquit-y Division No 1?who. it is
claimed by the defense, took the rwr.fr !
to the ?>rk s $ place*! on the i
-'and. The prosecution argued that
; - this paper is not now placed in evi-|
# .-TKe as proof, hut merely as showing j
that such a paper was filed, to show it
Is a record in the court and to prove
j 11 r isoft ion the stamp thereon of the'
?*rk of the court is sufficient at this I
time. |

Also Provided.
*
A regular army of 206.00ft men at
peace strength, capable of expansion to
254,000 men In time of war. was agreed
upon today by House and Senate conferees
on the army reorganization bill,
first of the big national defense measures.
The report will be submitted to
both branches of Congress for ratification
next week.
In the agreement on the regular army
the Senate bill system of organization
was retained as a substitute for the
House system, which would have recruiting
a maximum army of 140,000
men.
The regular line of the army, the bill
now provides, can never go below 160,000
and its maximum strength in times
of peace would be 175,000 officers and
men. In this calculation, however, there
are excluded 5.723 Philippine scouts.
6,409 in the Quartermasters Corps,
7,290 in the medical department, 3,387
in the Signal Corps and 8,750 unassigned
recruits, a total of 31,659. These
added to the regular line of 175.000 men
give a total regular army peace
strength of 206.659. The President is
authorized to increase the regular
army division to maximum strength
without congressional action.
Strength of Various Units.
Under the conference agreement the
regular army would consist of sixtyfive
regiments of infantry, twenty-five
regiments of cavalry, twenty-one regi
ments of field artillery, a coast artillery
corps of 30,009 men, including officers
and men, a signal corps of 3.387
men, 'ncluding the aviation section, and
seven regiments of engineers. In the
aviation section the number of officers
is increased from a total of sixty to
148, including one colonel, one lieuten- j
ant colonel, eight majors, twenty-four
captains and 114 first lieutenants. j
The organization plan contemplates ;
attaining the full peace strength with- i
in five years, as proposed in the orig- .
inal preparedness plans. i
General officers of the line would be ! i
increased by four major generals and j '
nineteen brigadier generals. The gen-| I
era*- staff - of the army would be in-I I
creased from thirty-four officers to fif- ! 1
ty-two. Thfr provision of the Senate I 1
biP which would have placed five of-j j
fleers of the National Guard in the gen- ! (
eral staf was stricken out. but pro-J ,
vision was made for officers of the N"a- J (
tional Guard to be assigned to volun- j ,
teer citizens* camps at government ex- . |
pense. An effort to give volunteer citi- | i
vena in ,.urr.n r>ftv of enlisted men while-, f
in training failed. I
Vocational Training Provided.
A provision, for vocational training |
for men in the regular army regulated
by the Secretary of War was left in
the bill and the House proposal for
government operation of nitrate manufacturing
plants to cost not more than
$20,000,000 also was accepted. Selection
of sites is left to the President. 11
The product of the plants when not i
needed in war time may be sold for
fertilizer under executive regulations.
Authority for the government to
seize and operate private plants for
manufacture of munitions of war in
time of need is given and the President
is empowered to appoint a board of five
men. two civilians and three army officers,
to investigate the advisability of
establishment of government plants
for their manufacture. The board would
report before January 1, 1917.
The President is authorized to appoint
a board to investigate the mobilization
of industries in time of war.
The regular army enlistment infixed
at seven years, three with the colors
and four in reserve, but if enlisted men
master military training in one year I
and wish to retire to the reserve, they
may be permitted on proving efficiency
and upon recommendation of superior
officers.
Volunteer Reserve Eliminated. I
The volunteer reserve army of 261,000 .
men, provided in the Senate bill, goes I
out. leaving the reserve army to the
National Guard, which will be fed- j
eralized. according to provisions or the
House bill. All officers and men of
the guard must take an oath of allegiance
to the United States as well
as to the respective states.
The National Guard at maximum
strength would be recruited on the
basis of $00 men to each congressional
district, which would aggregate a total
of 425,000 men. This reserve force together
with the regular army of 254,i>00
war strength would produce a combined
defense force of 679,000 men.
To Sig-n Report Monday.
Final agreement was reached on the
long-disputed measure after a short
session of the conference committee.
Another meeting will be held Monday
to sign the report.
"I think that we have an excellent
bill," said Chairman Chamberlain of
the Senate military affairs committee.
Chairman Hay of the House committee
also praised the report, and approval
by both Houses Is expected.
Provision of Bill May End
Employment of Marine Band I
Members for Outside Work
A provision retained in the army bill !
by the Senate and House conferees may!
have the effect of curtailing or entirely !
eliminating the employment of mem- j
l.avu nf (Via Marino RanH fnr ' i
tertainments. etc. This is the so-called
Reed amendment. Inserted in the bill |
by the Senate, and is as follows:
"Hereafter no enlisted man in the <
service of the United States in the j
Army, Navy and Marine Corps, respectively,
whether a non-commissioned officer,
musician or private, shall be detailed,
ordered or permitted to leave his
post to engage in any pursuit, business
or performance in civil life, for emolument,
hire or otherwise, when the same ]
shall interfere with the customary em- i
ployrnent and regular engagement of
local civilians in the respective arts,
trades or professions.''

I TRIP TO JAMESTOWN
President and Mrs. Wilson Change
From Mayflower to the
Sylph.
NEWPORT NEWS. Va? May 13.?The
yacht Mayflower, with the President
and Mrs. Wilson aboard for a w eek-end
cruise, anchored off the shipyard here
this morning from "Washington.
The yacht Sylph was awaiting the
President off Newport News, and soon
after his arrival here he and Mrs. Wilson,
with two secret service men, were
taken from the Mayflower to the Sylph
in a launch. The Sylph then left for a
trip up the James river. It was expected
the President and Mrs. Wilson would
visit the ruins at Jamestown.
In accordance with the President's
wishes, no salutes were fired as the
Mayflower passed Fort Monroe and several
battleships anchored in Hampton
roads. The presidential flag was
not flown, in order that the President
might attract as little attention as pos- ;
sible. When she arrived here the Mayflower
anchored near the Appam, the
British steamer brought her by a German
prize crew. <
Cruising slowly up the James river ^
the President stopped at several spots
and visited points of historic interest.
President and Mrs. Wilson have with ]
them Mrs. W. H. Boiling, mother of Mrs. ^
Wilson; Miss Bertha Boiling, sister of
Mrs. Wilson, and one of Mrs. Wilson's 1
brothers. i
They planned to rejoin the Mayflower
off Newport News tonight and remain ^
in this vicinity until tomorrow. I

Gen. Carranza has given no indication,
Special Agent Rodgers at Mexico
City reported today, of renewing immediately
through diplomatic channels
his suggestion that American troops be
withdrawn from Mexico. Eliseo Arredondo,
his ambassador here, telegraphed
yesterday for instructions to

An order issued today by the War

here today as indicating that the
Mexican de facto government is making
renewed efforts to capture bandits
who have raided American border
towns. Reports that the expedition
might have a hostile purpose were not
regarded seriously by administration
authorities.
They intimated that the action tended
to strengthen the belief that American
and Mexican military authorities at El
Paso had reached an unwritten agreement
on co-operation along the border to prevent
further bandit raids.
. The Mexican situation showed no sigTi
of immediate change here today. President
Wilson was cruising down Chesapeake
bay on the yacht Mayflower and
did not expect to return before Sunday
or Monday. Secretary Baker had taken
a week-end trip to Atlantic City and
Newark, N. J.
Would Keep U. S. Troops in Mexico.
Senator Lewis of -Illinois announced
yesterday that he would never vote,
and he believed the majority of the
Senate would never vote, to withdraw
troops from Mexico until the murderers
of Americans there had been punished,
and declared that everything possible
was being done to insure the safety of
the American troops now in Mexico.
He responded to an assertion by Sena-j
tor Kenyon of Iowa that nothing ade- j
quate was being done to safeguard the
soldiers who have crossed the border.
