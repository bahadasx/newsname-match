The present municipal adminis
tration, with the exception of the
Chief of Police, has no opposition,
this is the first time in the history
of the town, that a strong and de
termined fight s not made to get
possession of the town affairs.
The present council, however,
being non-political, was not after
the office, but were prevailed upon
to continue for another term.
Outlook Good For All Crops.
The crops all around St. Martin
ville are the finest we have seen
for many years, in fact, they are
more advanced than the crops we
have seen in neighboring parishes,
and if the season continues favora
ble, we may well expect one of the
largest and best crops grown here
for a long time. Every crop is
showing to the best.
