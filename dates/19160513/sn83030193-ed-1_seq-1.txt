,NAMK'UIPA, Mexico, May 12 (By wireless to Columbus,
N. M., May 13) A report has reached Gen. Pershing's head
quarters here that Villa, the bandit, at the head of an army
of 1,100 well equipped men, has executed a flank movement;
on the United States forces and is now moving in force toward :
the border only 30 miles south of Culberson's ranch.
This ranch is in New Mexico, near Columbus, and if
the report is true Villa is back where he started from when
the punitive expedition entered Mexico to capture him. I
A detachment of cavalry has been ordered out to investigate the re
port that Villa is once more heading toward the border. The report comes
from Ascencion, which Is almost 150 miles north of the United States!
headquarters in Mexico. Villa is said to be northeast of Ascencion. j
Assuming as true the report that he is now near the border the onlyi
explanation is that he has moved north through Sonora on the westerly ,
"side of the Continental Divide, recruiting an army by circulating the. re-1
port that the Americans have invaded Mexico for purposes of conquest.
He evidently has recovered from his wound. The location given
puts Villa between the United States base in Mexico .in.l the troops on
the border.
There are no reports of fighting anywhere along Hie line Pershing's
army.

I marchers, pourinir throuirh the chv

with scarcely a or a slacken of pace until late evening. By a
compact sequence of platoons, bjfelrictly enforced orders to close up
almost to a lock-step when at a halt hclow the stand or marching time,
the unprecedented feat of movingta marching column through the street
at the rate of 200 men a minute was accomplished all throuh
the day.
bach marcher carried a flag ovcr his shoulder. Except for ihesc,
the gaudy uniforms of the bands and the red, white and blue sashes of
Grand Marshal Chailes M. Sherill's aides, the only color of the spectacle
t was furnished by little bands of Hoy

This did not affeot the spend with
