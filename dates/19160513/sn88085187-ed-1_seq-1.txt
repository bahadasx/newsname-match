enormous sizp of these frauds but the WES* 1.111 or
the thieves has in large measure been revealed.
The thieves who have stolen these millions frdW
the treasury are, as a class, the same men who, for
the put quarter century, have monopolized the land
and natural resources of our nation, concentrating
tho ownership and control of American corporations
in the hands of a FEW, and, by marking- up the)
prices of commodities so that they are now nearly 100
per cent higher than in 1896, have drained into their
own coffers the results of America's unparalleled
productive capacity.
THE GREAT TAX THIEVES ABE THE AMER
ICAN MULTI-MI LLIONAIR KH.
The evidence tends to show that in o ne case
alone —the estate of L. V. Harkness—the pub
lished facts indicate evasions involving in taxes
and penalties more than ONE MILLION DOL
LARS.
The evidence tends to show the Rockefeller
Foundation as a device by which John D. Rocke
feller has escaped taxation upon more than
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS of his annual in
come.
The great frauds in connection with the theat
rical industry and foreign steamship companies,
involving millions of dollars in taxes and thous
ands of individuals, have been uncovered.
The evidence reveals the ineffectiveness of the
existing income tax law and shows the great
loopholes left by "jokers" in the act through
which hundreds of millions of dollars have so far
succeeded in avoiding taxation.
The utter inadequacy both in numbers and
ability of the treasury department's collection
force is clearly revealed.
Not only is there only one income tax agent for
each 500,000 of the population, but $1800 clerks
are pitted against the shrewdest lawyers and
most skilled accountants in the nation.
The treasury department's examining system
is defective in that it detects only the tax losses
arising from clumsiness and ignorance and is
powerless to prevent or expose sunning and de
liberate fraud.
But at the base of all the frauds lies the pro
vision of the law which guarantees complete
SECRECY regarding all income tax transac
tions.
Under this cloak of secrecy is concealed not
only the identity of the thieves, but the very ex
istence of the frauds, which might well have con
tinued to escape notice for years in the absence of
such prolonged and expensive investigation as I
have been privileged to make.
In the dark shadows of secrecy not only is the
tax thief concealed, but there is created a certain
breeding place for graft and the corruption of
government officials.
President Wilson and Secretary McAdoo are em
powered by the tonus of the income tax law to re
move this mantle of secrecy and make the tax re- 1
turns public so that the tax thieves may be known
and the frauds ended.
PUBLICITY OF RETURNS is the first essential
of efficient collection.
During the civil war the returns were published
and enormous attempts al fraud were uncovered.
When a reactionary congress at the end of tho war
enacted that the returns should be kept secret, be
cause publicity was "obnoxious to the taxpayer,'' the
number of returns fell from 94.887 in 1870 to 74,775
in 1871, although the latter year was one of unprece
dented prosperity.
Every man, woman and child in these United
States is the victim of the tax thieves!
If the tax had been fully paid the emergency
war taxes would have been abolished, the tariff
on sugar which has increased the price 100 per
cent in a few weeks, would not have been retain
ed, and the federal government would now have
in the vaults of the treasury the millions which
must be paid for the increase of the army and
navy.
The very men who have called loudest for
great army and navy expenditures to protect i
their property were at the same time robbing the
treasury of hundreds of millions of dollars.
The income tax must be paid — and PAID IN
FULL.
In the face of the array of evidence tha/. has been
presented, PRESIDENT WILSON AND CON
GRESS CANNOT REFUSE OR POSTPONE EF
FEOTIVE ACTION.

"I.o' man. ask me something
eas.v!" lie pleaded when Ihe sub
ject came up.
Thirteen children still live at
home. The other 1 I are married
and their families are scatter.-d.
"I'm-le Hob" has been married
twice.
At home this venerable Ken
tucky father is still the unques
tion-id master. His policies are
the household's. He lives by rule
and -by rule he governs.
Ills Hull's.
Here are some of his rules and
policies about rearing children:
"It don't pay to pamper young
uns.
"Bring children up to respect
you and they'll respect them
selves.
"Children have got to 'ie
taught to save.
"I'm partial to girls. They
atay at. home. Boys get out. They
got to, I reckon.
"A good wife Is th' best of all.
A tpan can't get ahead Without
■Xer.' • My wife helps me a heap.
That's th' way it ought to be."
Gives Them Nassafra*.
"Lucie Bob's" children are
seldom sick. When they are, he
says, a dose of sassafras tea '.s
medicine enough.
"Uncle Bob" has not been sick
a da* in his life. He is 5 feet x
incites tall and weighs 180
pound- He stands straight tnd
walks with a spring. He has the
shoulders and cheat of a perfect
build.
And spry?
"Looky here, you all!" he said,
aa he Jumped Into the air and
clicked hi* heels together TWICE
before coming down.
He does not smoke or drink.
He doesn't worry and he doesn't
hurry. He loves life, but he
doesn't fear death.
"Uncle Bob" owns most of the
mountain around Rockho-ise
Creek. He is a bank director,
He is said to he wortli |100,000.
Tastes Are Simple.
One would expect a man worth
$10(1.(1(10 to live in | line bouse,
but Tncle Hob prefers tne old
liouse and the hare floors.
"Ain't it what I was brought
up to?" be asks. "Then, I'm
