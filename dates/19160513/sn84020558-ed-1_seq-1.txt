Pending new orders from the presi
dent it was made plain at the war de
partment today that General Pershing's
expedition would remain in Mexico
watching developments beyond the
border. Meanwhile mobilization of na
tional guardsmen from the border
states and of additional regulars to
strengthen the border patrol at points
along the 1,800 mile stretch not pro
tected by the expedition, continues.
Should raiding be renewed additional
state troops will be called out for bor

Lx Ing taken by the war department
Neither Secretary Lansing nor Kliseo
rt i ilotido, Carranza ambassador des
ignate, took any step during the day
toward renewing diplomatic discussion
of the points that arose during the mil
itary conference. Mr. ArreUondo was
awaiting instructions from his gov
ernment Secretary Longing will dis
euag matters with General Scott on his
return next week before taking up In
formal communications with the Mexi
can ambassador. There was nothing
to indicate any desire to press matters
on either side.
War department officials laid stress
on the fact that General Funston's or
ders were unchanged. While General
Pershing now is concentrating his
forces along a shortened line, it was
stated positively that he would hurry
south iiKain immediately if he received
information that Villa or any consid
erable number of his band had gath
ered at a point within striking dis
tance. General Pershing, it was stated, kept
going as long as he had a hot trail
to follow. For days there has been no
mention of Villa's name in official dls
patchea and officials here and at the
border do not know his whereabouts
or even whether he is still alive. It
was tins situation, it was indicated, as
well as the Increasing danger of Captain John
clashes with the Mexican people as the
scattered chase moved southward,
which led General Funston to suggest
a rc-dlsposition of the troops in view
of what had been accomplished to-
adopted, although it is recognized on
all sides that there is urgent need
to re-establish an effective govern
ment in Ireland.
Much hoe is expressed that some
