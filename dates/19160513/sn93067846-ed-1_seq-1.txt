Columbia, ttay' 10.?The following
ttntement by J. Arthur Banks, presi?
dent of tha South Carolina ware?
house association, appeared yesterday
tn the Charleston News and Courier,
bavins; bean sent In by the Columbia
bureau:
"Since the last meeting of the
State Warehouse association there has
been considerable puBlto clouding of
what our association stands for, as
adopted by that meeting. Whether
the darkening of tha waters be inten?
tional or unintentional, the fact re?
mains that tha public has been led to
take different vlows of what we really
stand for. I desire now to state the
situation so plainly that every un?
prejudiced mind may be to no doubt
on the subject.
"The resolution was offered by Mr.
E. W. Dabbs and adopted by unani?
mous vote, and la aa follows:
"Resolved, That the State Demo?
cratic convention be requested to pro?
vide that' State Warehouse Commis?

j "this I interpret to mean that this

tem, and nothing else.
1 "To this resolution our association
Is. committed as an association, and to
nothing else. Commissioner McLau
tin's proposition to run for lieutenant
governor was heard. it was re?
acted upon by the association.
"We have up to date avoided en?
trance Into politics except In so far as
politics affect the preservation of what
we regard as the greatest industrial
and commercial programme yet un?
dertaken in the South.
"To show that our request is not
unreasonable, one of the announced
candidates for governor has expressed
himself to roe aa considering it noth?
ing but right that the farmers should
have this opportunity to present this
great Issue, and voluntarily said that
if there was no other way he would
gladly give half of his time for that
purpose."

In an authoritative Quarter tonight
the belief waa expressed fyat tomor?
row's meeting would bp tili last of the
conference and-that Gea| pbragon
would Indorse'the UntatttaAgreement
with perhaps a tew mlajjft change*
Asked whether tomortaars meeting
would be final, Gen. Obi*gon said:
'I do-pot know; there ratsjht be oth?
er meetings,''
Gen. Soott and Geiu< Funston are
unalterably opposed to any agreement
which seta a date for American with?
drawal from Mexico. However, the
American conferees are listening to
all proposals the Mexican minster of
war may make while waiting for him
I to realize that the intentions of the
i American government in .Mexico are
immovable.
In the meantime Gen. Obregon's
proposal tor a Joint troop patrol of
the border Is not given serious con?
sideration, although it was reported to
Washington.
The American conferees, it is said,
doubt If the de facto government can
muster sufficient forces to form a pa?
trol of the sort outlined and at the
same time carry on lbs campaign
against the Zapata and Villa forces.
While the stuation is still regarded
I as serious here, one circumstance
points to an easing of the tenson. Al?
though Gen. Funston is urgently need?
ed at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio,
to direct the mobilization and disposi?
tion of the additional troops ordered
to the border, Gen. Scott advised
that he remain here for the confer?
ence. It was pointed out that the
American chief of staff hardly would
keep his fellow conferee away from
his headquarters If the situation im?
peratively demanded any important
military preparatons. In the mean?
time, however, Gen. Pershlng Is said
to have received orders materially to
lessen his line of communication and
to draw In all scattered detachments.
Colonla Dublan Is reported to be the
objective of the northward retiring
columns.

M'MASTKR REFUSES COMMISSION
TO NON-RESIDENT BROKER
\ -
Acts Under Opinion of Attorney Gen?
eral?Case May Be Brought to Test
Broker's Law of Last Legislature?
I Letter From McLaurin on Subject.
Columbia, May 11.?Opinion by
John L. McLaurin, State warehouse
commissioner, is that mandamus pro?
ceedings will be brought against Fits
Hugh McM aster, State insurance
commissioner, to prohibit compliance
with* an interpretation recently given
by Attorney General Fecples, that
non-resident insurance brokers may
not be licensed under the existing In?
surance regulations In this State. The i
question ha3 been brought into prom?
inence by the application of Philip
La Tourette of New York, representa?
tive of Samuel, Cornwall & Stevens.
Mr. McMaster realizes that Mr. La
Tourette might be the means of re?
lieving considerably the stringent sit?
uation relative to the insurance mud?
dle, but emphasizes that the issuance
of licenses to non-resident brokers is
in violation of the act. Relative to the
application of Mr. LaTourette and the
company he represents, Mr, McLaurin
said:
"I have the promise of Samuel,
Cornwall & Stevens that if this li?
cense is granted they will take care
of such business as can not be han?
dled through regular channels on ac?
count of the withdrawal of the com?
panies. We are not trying to put
local agents out of business, only to
take care of what they are unable to
do. I don't want to injure any man
doing a legitimate business, but I do
not propose to allow our people to
suffer by reason of a monopoly if I
can help It. It is nothing to me per- i
sonally or officially. I am running
the State warehouse and ? I haven't
time to answer all the people writing
me for directions about insurance. I
was 56 years old yesterday and spent
14 hours at my desk. I can't stand
such a physical strain indefinitely."
The letter of Insurance Commis?
sioner McMaster to Warehouse Com
; mha^orior. McLaurin is as ioXkoy^^
^ReplyW to* ydur recent letter on
behalf of application of Mr. Philip La?
Tourette, who applied for a broker's
license, sending therewith his check
for $25 and his bond in the sum of
$5,000, I have to say that under the
Instructions of the attorney general
that I should follow the directions of
the statute as to whom I should li?
cense, and advising me t..at I should
decline license on the sole ground that
Mr. LaTourette is a non-resident of
the State, if no other ground exists,
and that in case of contest, he, the
attorney general, would represent this
office and present arguments to the
court to sustain the law prescribed by
the legislature. I have to decline to
issue a license to Mr. LaTourette on
the ground that he is a non-resident
of the State.
"In all other respects I find that Mr.
LaTourette comes vlthln the terms
of the law in that he is a well inform?
ed insurance broker, licensed as I un?
derstand In the State of New York!
for many years. He has filed the re- |
quired bond and in all other particu?
lars fulfills the conditions of the law.
1 realize, too, that It Is possible that
Mr. LaTourette might do considerable
towards rellevng the present insur?
ance situation In South Carolina as
suggested by yourself, but I have no
option In the matter and as Indicated
above, on the ground that he is a
non-resident of the State, as is pro?
scribed in the last sentence of section
2 of the act providing for the licens?
ing of insurance brokers, I declined
to issue and am returning herewith
Mr. LaTourctte's check for $25 and
his bond In the sum of $5,000."

TWO COMPANIES DROPPED.
COLUMBIA AND ELLOKEE LOSE
MILITARY UNITS.
Organizations Failed to Meat Require
ments of War Department and fed?
eral Aid Was Withdrawn?Action
Indorsed by Council.
Columbia, May 11.?Gov. Manning
yesterday signed an executive order
mustering out yf service Companies B
and K, Second infantry, located at Co?
lumbia and Elloree. The action of the
governor was upon the recommenda?
tion of the military council which
met In Columbia several days ago.
Said Gov. Manning: "It is a matter
of extreme regret that It becomes nec?
essary for me to Issue the executive
order mustering out these two com,'
panles. I am deeply Interested in th
National Guard of South Carolina, ar
am anxious that it be maintained A
m
the highest state of efficiency at ^
times. 42
"It seems that the two corapf v
referred to have not been ab' c
meet the requirements of the wr
partmen*. and the federal gover t
has withdrawn its support.
"In addition to this, the military
council of South Carolina, after go?
ing over the recommendations of the
war department, in their report to
me, recommended that these com?
panies be mustered out of service
It then became my duty to approve
this recommendation.
"I deem it of importance that the
National Guard of South Carolina be
maintained at all times at the very
highest state of efficiency, and this
action is in the interest only of ef?
ficiency in the National Guard."
I The following executive order was
issued:
"The military council of South Car?
olina having recommended that Com?
panies E and K, Second South Caro?
lina Infantry, be mustered out of the
service of the State on account of
their failure to comply with the re?
quirements for efficiency prescribed
by the war department, and said
council having baaed their recommen?
dation upon the report of the Inspee
t^rlnstructjar to ...tha scar dsssirtment
and the letter from the chief, division
of militia affairs to the adjutant gen?
eral of South Carolina, dated April
18, 1916, In which letter it is stated:
" 'Companies E and K having been
jon probation since the last annual in?
spection, are not considered as having
shown sufficient Improvement to wart
rant their retention In service, and
recognition thereof has been with?
drawn by the war department dating
from April 18, 1916/
"It appears to me that the recom?
mendation of the military council Is
warranted by the facts, and that the
best Interests of the National Guard
of this State make it necessary that
the companies above mentioned
should be disbanded. The adjutant
general of South Carolina will at once
Issue the necessary orders for the
mustering out of these companies."
COAST ARTILLERY FOR SERVICE.
Eleven Companies Ordered From
Army Posts on Gulf and Atlantic
Coasts.
Washington, May 9.?Eleven compa?
nies of coast artillery stationed at
Gulf and Atlantic coast posts were or?
dered to San Antonio, Texas, tonight,
to serve as infantry with the border
patrol.
Secretary Baker announced the de?
cision to draw upon the coast artillery,
virtually the only available regular
troops left north of the border, after
a conference at the war department
late tonight. He said no post would
be left without a sufficient garrison.
The secretary also formally an?
nounced the orders for the movement
to San Antonio of the five batteries of
the Fifth field artillery at Fort Sill,
Okla. He said three batteries of the
Third Held artillery at Tobyhanna, Pa.
had been ordered heir in readiness for
border service if necessary. The coast
artillery companies ordered out are:
127th, Galveaton; 164th, New Or?
leans; 20th and 77th, Pensacola, Fla;

Oglethorpe, Ga.; 112th, Delaware Riv?
er, Forts Dupont, Delaware and
Mott; lOSd, Fort Howard, Md. and
14 5th. Charleston, S. C.
Secretary Baker said these orders
did not result from any new reports
from the border, but were contemplat?
ed in the decision early today to re?
inforce Gen. Funston's patrol.

DECREASE IN WINTER WHEAT.
DEPARTMENT OP AGRICULTURE
MAKES REPORT.
Severe Weather Has Caused A mn
donment of Considerable Portion of
Crop?Acreage is Smaller.
?? . 19
Washington, May 8.?Almost half
a billion bushels is the winter harvest
forecast for this year by tho depart?
ment of agriculture in its May crop
report. That is 166,000,00? bushels
less than harvested last year, when
a record crop was gathered in tho
United States, but the crop this year
1 ^rowing on a much smaller acre
.nd the severe winter caused a
c y abandonment of the acreage
2 .ted last fall. In all, 4,236,000
g us were abandoned, leaving for ,
** rvest 33,030,000 acres, which is
? 133,000 acres less than harvested
! jst year. |
"Present conditions cf growth are
poorest in the central group of the
|States where winter killing was most
severe, the conditions ranging from
23 per cent, below the 10 year av?w
age condition at this season in II? !
linois down to 10 par cent below in
Iowa," the department reported. 'In
Montana and Washington the condl- ;
tion is 11 below the 10 year avenure.
"The Atlantic coast crop is gen?
erally fail to good. The Increase
over the condition figure of 78.3 per
cent, last month is due partly to the
elimination of the abandoned acre?
age from consideration in determin?
ing the present term.
"The Hessian fly, reported as ac?
tive in many sections last fail, is not
seemingly so much in evidence. Men?
tion is made of the presence of tie
green bug in north central Oklahoma,
but the parasites of this insect axe
present also and it is hoped will limit
the damage it might otherwise do.
The winter wheat crop this year
promises to yield 499,280,000 bushek\ .
the department of agriculture an?
nounced today, basins; its forecast on
the condition of the crop May 1. Tho
output will probably be above Of bf"
low those figures according to tuet
change in conditions from now until
time of harrest Tod?^,.frees*r
compares with 665.04M0* ftetsli
harvested last year, the greeifcM
winter wheat crop ever gathered 111
this country and with a forSUaJt Of
640,000,000 bushels made last De?
cember before the crop entered the
winter from which it emerged lh
rather poor condition, showing A de?
cline of 9.4 points compared With the
ten year average decline Of ft.6
points. On the crop's condition April
1 a forecast of 496,000,000 bUshsls
was made by the bureau of crop esti?
mates, assuming average abandon?
ment of acreage and average influ-^
ences on the crop to harvest time.
The area of winter wheat to be
harvested Is estimated at about
33,020,000 acres as a result of the
May 1 canvass. The area planted last
fell was 37,266,000 acres, a decrease
of 4.756.000 acres from the record
area of the 1915 crop and compares
with a yearly average of 22,088,000
acres In the preceding five years.
The condition of winter wheat on
May 1 was 82.4 per cent of a normal?
compared with 78.3 on April 1 last
92.9 on May 1 last year and 87.5, the .
ten year May 1 average. That con?
dition is indicative of a yield of 11.1
bushels an acre, compared with 18.2
bushels harvested last year, and 1ft
bushels in 1914.
Details of the May report show:
Rye?Condition 83.7 per cent of
a normal, compared with 87.8 on
April 1 last, 93.3 on May 1 last year,
and 90.6 the 10 year May 1 average.
Meadow (hay) Lands?Condition
88.4 per cent, of a normal, compared
with 89.8 on May 1 last year and 88.3
the 10 year May 1 average.
Hay?Stocks of hay on farms May

13 per cent, of last year's crop,
against 8,468,000 tons, or 12.1 per
cent .on May 1 last year, and 8,10ft,
