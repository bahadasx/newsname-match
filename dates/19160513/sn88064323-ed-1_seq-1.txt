Ah a stock raiser Mr Jbdeambre
has not only been one of the plo
peers of Ida section but he has
ever been extensively interested in
that bium h of industry. Catch
ingthi spirit of improvement, he
whs on« of the early investors in
t boron glued sires to head his
herds East summer the visit to
his section of the plague of char
bon so decimated Ins cattle as to
prove disheartening to less stout
nut, mes. Following the plague in
his cattle, cholcia made its ap
pearanee among his improved
breed of lings From a herd of a
hundred and forty head he saved
alive barely enough for the fouri
dation of his future held.
The charbon, spreading from
Ins pastures, Infected his mules,
employed in cultivating his fields
Here, the plague so curtailed his
working force that his crop mate
riaiiy Buffered, minimizing the
hat vest.
The prospects in the growing of
cane wero so gloomy that Ire was
encouraged to plant rice. As this
crop was about ready for the
sickle rain and wind destroyed it.
fclo, in summing up his farming
operations of last year lie found
himself $8000 behind of Ins start
at the beginning of the year.
Nor, was this all. I hose who he!
unfortunately owed wanted their
money, and wanted it atome. In
the demoralized condition of af
fairs he found it difficult to get
the funds necessary to finance
field operations for this 'year.
After doing as much as available
means would allow, he put to sea
with a lugger, in the effort to find
a market at remunerative ptices
for the produce of his section. It
is pleasing to record that this
venture has not, been without its
rewards for his energy and cour
age.
He stated significantly that he
met more people upon the streets
of a Texas eoast town whom he
knew and who knows him, than
he meets on a visit to New Iberia,
his country-seat town. But be

A J. M A U M t B FOR HAITI POST.
( hanccH favor the appointment
of A. ,! Maumua, of New Iberia,
La., as collector of customs at
Fort au Frinoe, Haiti. The posi
tion is one of great responsibility
and carries with it a salary of
$9000.
Mr. Ma urn us is chairman of the
Democratic commi tee of Iberia
paiish. Lie was summoned to
Washington a few «lays ago by
Beuatoi Broussaul at the request
of the spiaetary ut state. Mr.
Lansing had asked Senator Brous
said pieviously if lie knew a high
class man with a th eut knowledge
of .French, Spanish and English
This led to the mention of Mr.
M aumus.
The post is a peculiar one In
that the appoiutme it is made by
the president of Ilriti It is un
derstood, however, that the up
pointmeut is to go to an American
who is to be approved by the
('resident of the Juited States
This makes practically necessary
a reeomtnendotion from Washing
ton
(Treat care Is taken In the selec
timi of the man for this place, as
on his honesty and good judgment
depends not only lie confidence
ol the Haitian government but
the reputation of the United
States throughout Lutin America
To get such an American who has
at his command French and Span
ish is not an easy tusk.
During a conference between
th« secretary of state, Mr. Man
mus arid Senator Broussard,
wliieh lasted more than an hour,
there is reason to believe that Mr.
Lansing was well i npreased with
Mr Manillas The Louisiana sen.
alors and all inemb mb of (be dele
gation in the House with the ex
ception of Representatives Wat
kins and Martin, who are out of
the city, signed a highly cormnen
datory recommendation, which
was handed to Mr. Lansing.
Mr. Mfimmis wrt.s formerly a
bookkeeper in the custom house
in Now Orleans He became a
custom house agent for a large
New Orleans importing firm.
His knowledge of Spanish was ac
quired during seven years in Mex.

Geo. L Glover, general con

BURGLAR LIFTS CAKE,
MISSES RICH HAUL.
Possibly frightened Away,
Before completing his mi
ll er taking.
Last Sunday afternoon the
home of Mr. Rosemond LeBlmc,
out on Julia street, was burglarir,
e l. The parties who engineered
the deed, it seems, were prêt, y
well acquainted with the move
ment of the immediate neighbor,
bond. That afternoon not only
all the inmates of Mr. LeBlanc's
home were away, but also his
near neighbors of either side.
The house was enter«*«! from the
rear, through a kitchen window,
This gave the depredators easy
access to all parts of the house
Two wardrobes were opened .<u«l
their contents much tumbled and
scattered. Dressers were opened
and the contents of drawers all
but emptied upon the lioor. A
loaf cake was taken from the re
frigerator.
D was at firpt suspected that
possibly some one who had served
the family as a servant, and who
knew all the ins and outs of the
home, had worked this act of bur
glary. Yet the fact rhat Mr. L«
Blanc's desk was not disturbed,
would seem to indicate that it
wns not servants. It so happened
that both Mr. and Mrs LcBlanc
carried a key to the desk. Mrs
Leblanc's key was in the war
drohe on one of the shelves and
lay under a garment wiii«h ev*
dently was not moved, nor dis
(orbed. The desk that evening
contained some late, collections
amounting to possibly $10 0b
more. The burglars missing this
treasure, have lost their chance
completely, for burglar-proof
vaults will alone be trusted lu re
after to guard such valuables.
Mr. Leblanc Is the agent for
the Standard Oil (Jo. and lias
charge of the company's oil ware
house in the western part of this
city. A bunch of keys contiol
ling the locks of that property
are misemg A watchman was
immediately put on duty un H

procured.

"I want to tell you what wonderful benefit I have re
ceived from the uso of Thedford's Black-Draught," writes
Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky.
"It certainly has no equal for la grippe, bad colds,
liver and stomach troublée. I firmly believe Black-Draught
saved my little girl's life. When she had the measles,
they went In on her, but one good dose of Thcdford'a
Black-Draught made them break out, and she has had no
more trouble. I shall never be without
Buck-Draught
in my home." Por constipation, Indigestion, headache, dizzi
ness, malaria, chills and fever, biliousness, and ail similar
ailments, Thedford's Black-Draught has proved Itself a safe,
reliable, gentle and valuable remedy.
If you suffer from any of these complaints, try Black- #
Draught It is a medicine of known merit Seventy-five &
yeare of splendid success proves its value. Oood for j
young and old. For sale everywhere. Price 25 cents.
