NAME SUSSEX ASSAILANT
French Writer Says He it Lieut. Otto
Cteinbrick.
Paris! May 12. The official admis
sion that a German submarine torpe
doed the Sussex is widely commented
on in today's press which considers
that the admission accentuates Ger
many's collapse before President Wil
son's attitude.
The Petit Parisien says an examina
tion of the comments of the German
press shows It is dominated by the
feeling that Germany has undergone
one of the gravest diplomatic checks
in her history and that she dare not
answer Washington as she would like.
There 1s considerable skepticism
about the punishment of the command
er of the submarine. Marcel llutin
says: "We are curious to know, and
perhaps the American Government
will show the same curiosity, as to
what sort of punishment has been
chosen for the commander of the sub
marine. Has not Admiral von Cap-
pelle promoted Lieutenant Otto Stein
brick, the commander of the U-18,
which I understand was the submarine
which torpedoed the Sussex?"
TURKS HARD PRESSED
Army of Bagdad in Danger of Being
Cut Off.
Petrograd, May 12. The Russian
force in Persia which during the last
ten days has completed the arduous
task of traversing the mountain dis
trict separating it from the Tureo-
Persian frontier, driving the Turks up
on their strongly lortitied base of
Khanikin, now stands at the very
threshold of Mesopotamia, 110 miles
northeast of Bagdad and future devel
opments in connection with the Itus
sian expedition toward Bagdad are be
ing awaited with the greatest interest
The hasty retreat of the Turks in
this quarter seems to imply that the
forces defending Khanikin have been
greatly overestimated, and it is appur
cut that they have as yet been unable
to transfer the force released by the
surrender of Kue-el-Amara to assist
their hardpressed army north of Bat;-
dad. i lie Kusslan advance upon
Khanikin, therefore, very seriously
threatens the whole rear of the Turk
ish Bagdad army, confronting that
army with the possibility ot being en
tirely cut olf from the City of Bagdad
and the forces operating to the south
ward against the British.

mi fiu ;i
James Connrolly and John McDer-
mott Shot May 9th
SIGNERS OF. PROCLAMATION
Protests in House of Commons Failed
to Save Prominent Leaders in
Revolt.
London, May 12 James Connolly
and John McDermott were shot yester
day morning for complicity in the re
bellion, said a dispatch from Dublin
last evening.
The official headquarters announce
ment at Dublin regarding the execu
tions is as follows: "The trial of
two prominent leaders of the rebel
lions whose names w ere- appended to
the proclamation issued by the so
called provisional government, name
ly James Connolly and John McDer
mott, took place on May 9. The sen
tence of death was returned in each
case, and the sentences were carried
out this morning, after confirmation
by the general commanding in chief."
Connolly w'as styled by his associat
es commandant-general of the. Irish re
publican army. He was one of . the
seven signers of the proclamation is
sued by the insurgents at Dublin at
the outbreak of the revolt.
At the Eesslon of the House of Com
mons Thursday vehement protests
were made by Irish members against
the execution of the rebel leaders, and
an attempt was mad to obtain an un-
lerstanding that there would bo no
more of them. Promier Asquith said
that two other persons were under
sentence of death and that he thought
it unjust that preferential treatment
should be accorded,4n case of men of
equal guilt. -Mr.Ctninolly lived for
several years In New York, where he
was active as i socialist and writer on
labor topics. He -returned to Ireland
about five years afo to assist in organiz
aig the Irish labor party. He was
about 50 years old. :, ' v
John McDermott was known to
Irishmen in the United States as one
of the most brilliant orators in Ireland
and as one of the so-called inner circle
of revolutionists active in the recent
uprising.
At the outbreak of the war, McDer
mott, a comparatively young man, was
editor of Irish Freedom, a Dublin
newspaper ardently opposed to re
cruiting among the Irish for tho Brit
ish army. This paper was one of
those suppressed for its attitude on
this subject.
Much regret is expressed by influen
tial Liberal newspapers that the Gov
ernment failed to stop the execution
of Connolly and McDermott. The
Manchester Guardian and The Nation
contend that a commutation of these
sentences would have been not only
clemency but policy.
A Central News dispatch from Dub
lin says that a court-martial is trying
the ollicer believed to liuve been re
sponsible for the putting to death of
F. Shechy Skelllngton, the Irish editor,
who is said to have been executed with
out the sanction of the military author
ities.
Premier Asquith's sudden resolve to
50 to Dublin, which was hailed by his
supporters as a stroke of genius, has
had the effect of assuaging political
passions. Parliament does not meet
Fridays, and the fact that there was
no session helped to bring about a day
of calm in strunge contrast to Thurs
day's sensations.
Some regret was expressed over the
selection of Mr. Dillon to move the
.esolution in the House of Commons
concerning tho executions. Manv of
the strongest supporters of Ireland's
causo advanced the belief that it
would have been better had some less
emotional Irish member been selected
for that duty. The leellng prevails
that everything possible ought now to
be done to avoid Inflnmlnir nublic
entlnient.
Premier Asqulth appears to have
spent the day In Dublin seeing officials
there and acquainting himself person
ally with the situation, and it Is pre
sumed that It may be two or three days
before any radical decisions are adopt
ed, although it Is recognized on nil
sides that there Is urgent, need ta re
establish an effective civil government
In Ireland.
IiPiulon, May 13. Sovoral hundred
prisoners arrested in connection with
the recent revolt In Ireland were re
leased todny following the arrival of
Premier Asqulth nt Dublin. It Is
stated that tho premier will Issue
proclamation.

A COMMITTEE PROPOSAL
Recommendation Made on Ground that
Penalty is Not Enforced by the
Church.
Saratoga Springs, May 12. Mem
bers of the Methodist Episcopal
church who play cards, dance and at
tend the theatre will no longer be
liable to expulsion, if recommenda
tions made by a subcommittee of the
general conference here, which has
been considering the question of
amusements, are adopted by the com
mittee on the ttate of the church and
later by the conference. The amend
ment was offered the main committee
late yesterday afternoon, and after
acrimonious discussion action was de
ferred until Monday.
By a vote of 10 to 8 the subcommit
tee recommended the elimination from
the bock of discipline of the clause
prohibiting these amusements, and
offered as a substitute an additional
paragraph in which warning is made
against tho diversions. The effect of
the proposed change is to remove the
absolute prohibition, but to place the
church -on record as still strongly op
posed to these forms of amusement.
A minority report was submitted ad
vising the retention of the paragraph
as it now stands.
Those favoring removal of the
restriction, maintained that the penal
ty now provided Is not enforced iu any
church, and that the effect upon young
people will be much greater if a pro
vision that cannot be enforced Is with
drawn, and a general warning is
sued, that the church does not sanc
tion "dancing, playing of games of
chance, attending theaters, nort-t
races, circuses, dancing parties, oi
patronizing dancing schools." Opirn
sition to the change Is based on the
allegation that it means the church is
'letting down the bars."

CARRANZA TROOPS IK NORTH
Six Troops of American Cavalry Trail
ing Bandits Who Took Part in
Latest Raid
Washington, May 12. Failure of tho
military conference at Ei Paso to
reach a definite agreement has
brought no change in the policy of tho
administration toward Mexico. Presi
dent Wilson and his cabinet yeHttrday
discussed Gen. Scott's report an
nouncing that the questions at issue
had been referred back by the confer
ees to their respective governments
for diplomatic discussion. Later it
was officially stated that the situa
tion was unchanged.
The text of Gen. Scott's report of
his flnul discussions has not been
made public. There are indications,
however, that he readied a "gentle
man's understanding'' with the Mexi
can war minister, though it possibly
has no more definite lorm than a
statement by each side of what steps
it is proposed to take toward check
ing raids along the Texas border, re
newed with the attacks on Glenn
Springs.
War department officials laid stress
on the fact that Gen. Funston's orders
wero unchanged. While Gen. Per
shing now is concentrating his forces
along a shortened line, it was stated
positively that he would hurry south
again immediately if he received defi
nite information pr,t Villa or any
considerable nutnnfr of his band had
gathered at a point within striking
range.
Movements of Carranza troops to
ward the Big Bend region were as
sumed to be directed toward an effort
to round up the Glenn Springs raiders
from the south while American forces
are pressing them from the north. The
war department had no information
that Maj. Langhorne and Ills lour
troops of cavalry had crossed the line,
but assumed that he had done so if
there was a hot trail to follow. In all,
six troops are near cr at the border in
the vicinity of Bouquillas, where the
bandits recrossed into Mexico. It is
toward this point that the Carranza
forces from Piedras Negras, number
ing about 1500 men. are understood to
be heading. Ollicials saw no reason
to suspect any but friendly intentions
behind the movement.
COST OF GETTING NEWS
The Associated Press Spends Over
$3,C00,C00 a Year.
At a cost of ?3,197,413 there was fur
nished to over 900 daily newspapers of
the United States last year the news
of the world through tho medium of
the Associated Press. The Associated
Press constitutes the largest news
gathering and distributing agency in
the world. Its position has been great
ly strengthened since the war started,
as some of the foreign agencies have
been forced to curtail their activities,
particularly in the Far East. This
has caused the Associated Press to ex
pand its own facilities in many parts
of the world whereas it formerly de
pended upon Reuters of London for
news of the Orient, on the 1 lavas
Agency of Paris lor African informa
tion and upon Wolff's of Berlin tor
still other parts of the world.
The Associated Press, working in
close hurmony with those foreign
igencics, thoroughly covered the world
for news of Importance. Such were
the arrangements that even houth
tnerican news for the most part came
through London.
The foreign branch of tho service
'.ast year cost $519,000 against $430.-
;162 in 1914 and $224,544 in 1913. From
the outbreak or tho war in August,
1014.. up to the end of the follow ing
December, the lorelgn service cost
$258,651. an amount in excess of t ho
expenditures in this direction during
ihe entire preceding year.
The Associated Press operates over
50.U00 miles of leased wires in this

"Washington,' May. 12. America's
next stop in the negotiations with tho

account of the implied threat con
tained in the German note of May 5, in
which the Imperial government ex

upon Great Britain observing the
rules of international law in dealing

many "complete liberty of decision"
unless this end was accomplished.
It was stated today that Germany's
note had complicated tbe situation.
making it impossible for tho United
States to press its demands upon the
Allies at once without appearing to do
so at the bidding of the Berlin gov
