SCOTT COUNTY KICKER
Vol. XV
BENTON, MO., MAY 18, 1916.
No. 15.
The County Court
Question of Re-Employing Farm Ad
viser Taken Under Advisement.
Saloon at Station Loses Out.
There wan really nothing of In
porta iilt doing In the t'OUnt.l
wurt loom last week until Thurs
day. The usual routine work or
making allowances to paupers, of
flews sod other is alwa.vs about
the same and of little or no inter
est except ti those who net the
money.
But Thursday l noticed in un
usual number of autoinohllra
some of then very high priced In
front of the court house, 1 knew
there must be a "hen on." aftil
nuked the court house Janitor
what it meant.
"Farmers' meeting,'1 he replied,
"Farmers' meetlnrf i queried,
"I thought farmers usually role
in wagons."
Then i remembered or having;
heard, a Tew la,vs before, that
farm Adviser Deer's three year
contract had expired ami that
some oT the landlords were mak
ing special efforts to net .1 good
rrowd of farmers before th"
rourt to insist on his re-employ-uent
for another term oT three
years under somewhat different
terms.
It seems there was doubt as
to whether or not the court
would re-employ him it nil
Three years ago it was the Sik"s
ton landlords who encouraged the
rourt to try the experiment and
kgreed to pay $300 a year or his
salary. Hence the cost to the
county was only $1,000 per year
The balance or $3,000 is paid
from national and state funds.
Now Sikeston landlords want to
retain the farm adviser, but want
to Ik1 relieved of paying their
share of the salary paid by them
In the past, and want the county
to pay it nil. As a concession to
Ct the co-operation of the Hen
ton politicians and the New Ham
burg priest, the Sikeston crowd
agreed to huve the adviser's
headquarters at Benton instead
or sikeston. That brought about
"harmony."
Hut that isn't all they want
Landlords and politicians are
never mealy-mouthed when noinir
after anything. They not only
want to be relieved or paying the
part they have heretofore paid,
but want the county adviser's
pay increased so he can have an
automobile. Instead ol the coun
ty paying $1,000 as heretofore
they want the county's part to
Tie 82,150 an increased burden or
$1,150 per year on an empty
treasury.
Only last month the board of
equalisation spent two weeks
and some $51)0 of the people's
money In raising assessments in
order to produce more revenue
Tit 1 1. the same landed Interests ap-
eared and beat down the assess
ment until the increased revenue
will not be very much And the
revenue fund Is now empty
thanks to the fancy court house
advocated by the landlords
'
Always nosing around where I
have no business, I drifted int -the
court room to take a look : . i
the "farmers" mentioned by the
Janitor,
Th 're tlie.V were : Dr. Vount
nnd 1 H. Qaleener, sons-ln-laws
of ,T. E. Marshall-. J. V, Baker,
Jr, : Charley McMilllln. W m. 1 1
and Charley Tanner ami others
in short, the men who hold title
ti Richland township; Hoi) Harri
son, the largest landowner i:i
Morley township; Dr, Haw, of
the million dollar Hunter 16 nd
corporation; 'Father'' Moeuinc,
th 3 largest land owner in the
northwest part of the county,
and Dr. Fraser ami Korval Ander
son, representing the landed in
terests of Commerce township
Peblnd these were unite a num
ber or working farmers whom
they had Induced to come to
"make a showing," but these
took no part In the discussions,
Against this force wore Joe
Parker and Ike Marshall, repre
senting the D. F. Marshall Land
Co.'s interests around Blodgett
Tin so people have no use for
' irm adviser, They can te:l tie i
tenants what they wan; without
the huttinn In Of any farm advis
er. They fought against the ad
viser, but were in a hopeless mi
nority. Mr. Baker made the first talk
and pointed with pride to the as
sembled farmers who had taken
such great interest in the welfare
or their county as to appear be
fore the court en mass Dr. Fra
r.er. Dr. Haw, Mr. Galeener and
several others unbosomed them
sehes about the value of a farm
adviser and assured the court
that while the assemblage was
not as large as it might be, yet
the general sentement of the peo
ple of the county favored their
project.
Then something happened that
almost caused me to yell. A fight
over a saloon petition had just
been disposed of which caused
more people to be in the court
room than ordinarily. Hence the
court could not tell who were in
terested in the matter before the
court, and who were Just specta
tors, Yet all who were la town
were urged to 'help make a
bowing.
Judge Bowman made n little
talk and suggested that in order
to find out whether the gathering
represented the general sentiment
oT the county, a poll be taken by
tOWMhIpa, This was done. As
tov nshlps we. e called the rul
ers" were asked to rise to their
leet. And it was found that the
majority present was the result
of the efforts of "Father" Moe-
nig of New Hamburg and tie
He n ton DOlltlOlanS,
Among those who stood up for
Teuton Were such horncy-handed
sons or toil as Heese Allen. V. H.
Heisserer, Dr. Haw, Ernest Walk
er. Arthur Crisnion and Joe Norrd
In all there were 'XI present, and
48, or more than hair, were from
this. Moretand, township the
work of the court house farmers
and "Father" Moenig.
Richland township, with Its ,".
000 people, was able to make n
showing of 10. while Kelso town
ship With 8 similar population
had a representation of eleven
Invaded by so iabOfOUS a farmer
as Frank Conipns.
Commerce had a reprentatlon
of nine, with such sturdy farmers
as Dr. T. F. Frazer and Norval
Anderson in the lead.
Rylvanla township was repre
sented by three, who belonged to
Moenlg's group, Otherwise Bylva-
niS was not represented.
When Morley township was
called Hob Harrison stood up
alone.
Tywapplty township was not
represented at all, and the two
from Sandy woods township were
Opposed to the scheme
This over XV, H, Tanner stepped
forward and appointed himself
chairman Then questions were
put In regular convention style
and. with the exception of the
two Bandylanders everything
carried unanimously Here is the
only place where the actual
farmers present took any part.
The vote was by rising, and when
the leaders got up the followers
also got up.
One of the questions put was.
"All who believe that every dol
lar expended by the county on a
farm adviser will be returned a
hundred fold, rise." All got up
except the two. Rut I have my
doubts about their believing it
If the landlords believe it, it looks
mighty niggardly in them to try
to shift the expenditure of a dol
lar that will return to them a
hundred. Convince me that 1 can
get back even two dollars for
one invested, and I will not a.-k
someone else to put up the dolla r
Neither will the landlords
However the court did not seem
to believe it. and took the matter
under advisement, promising to
give their decision at 1 o'clock
At that time they put off their
decision until June. And if the
crowd behind this scheme fails to
get what it want a it will be the
first time they have been sat
upon, Whether or not a farm adviser
is a good investment, under til"
conditions in Scott county, i do
not knew. Hut it is evident tint
th tllll'l of the soil are not
much I nte rested for there wore
very feu if any. present - this
meeting, except tbowe that were
drummed" In,
From li s pulpit Sundn v "F i
th r" Mosuig told how well pleas
ed ii iv i- with the showing he
made, and that he expects moi'i
if his farmers to be present when
tha court is to decide in June
il 'iic the court may expect to
be more heavily bombarded In
"drummed up" fanners next
Mouth
in conclusion I may safely add
th ii not another paper of the
county win ten its readers the
.hole truth about this "farmers'
meeting." And it is because the
Kicker tells what the rulli R -w-ers
don't want told that Ih hi '
lords, priests and politicly ui M
ii a uud paper The? don't want
ih' mass s to know the truth
Thlt is Why It is a sin" to read
th Kicker. The Kicker tells It,
Another event that created
some interest was the petition of
John ti. Boherer for a renewal of
his license at the station, A little
after Christinas this saloon was
found to be very short of funds
with plenty of debts and the
place has been in a purgatorial
state ever since and, under differ
ent management, is pulling out.
It is said that the saloon is a pay
ing proposition and that the bus
iness interests of Lainbertville
want to get rid of Scherer.
Therefore a fight was made and
he could not get a majority of
signers. The count stood seven
for and seven against. It is said
that Andy Fornes has a suffi
cient jetition and will ask for li
cense. The license of the present
saloon expires May 22.

EXPERIENCE SU W.
It takes a very long time for
people to learn from experience,'
says The St. Paul Dall.V News.
"About 40 years ago the state
of Texas gave 3.000,000 acres of
land to an English syndicate in
exchange for a state capital
building,
"The building has been deter
iorating In value ever since, Th
land has been increasing in value
evtr since. Originally the land
was estimated at ."0 cents an
acre, Last year, less than one
third of it was sold for $4,730,; 00
The other two-thirds is still held
by the syndicate. It was a clear
case of selling the birthright of
the people for a mess of pottage,
and not very good pottage at
that.
"Hut now the news comes that
this same state of Texas, in utter
disregard of this experlenoe, Is
about to sell 1,500,000 acres of
school lands.
"Once again private individuals
are to be given the chance to
grow rich by appropriating val
ues created by the people of Tex
as. Once again opportunities for
labor, that might be reserved for
the people, are to pass under con
trol of speculators. And once
again a possible source of relief
for the unemployed is to be closed
"As for Minnesota, the whole
sale squandering of the public
landed domain is pointed to with
pride by succeeding administra
tions and public officers and is
the subject of much self-congratulations
in many newspapers."
The capitalists derive their
power through control of govern
ment. If the workers would
achieve power they must get it
from the same source.
