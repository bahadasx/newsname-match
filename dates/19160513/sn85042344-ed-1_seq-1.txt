Fat Criminal anil Civil Docket Awaits
the Continuation of

Special to The World.
CUHKMHUK, Okla.. May 12.
With but a few cas.s completed on a
large criminal and civil docket for the
regular May term of the Kogvrs
county district court, the "wheels of
Justice" werj forced to stop grinding
owing to the fact that the funds for
this purpose in the county's treasury
were running low, and ail cases for
hearing on the criminal docket have
been continued to a date In Septem
ber or later.
Two murder cases were continued
that ol John Davis, facing trial for
the third time in this court, charged
with the killing of Marshal U C.
Wolfir.bergcr in Collinsville In May
last, and that of Andrew Jones,
charged with complicity In the mur
der of Harney Guilliams at Chelsea In
January last.
John Davis, who was charged Joint
ly with his brother. Joe, with the
killing of Wolflnberiier. has faced
trial on two former occasions for the
the offense, but each has resulted In
a mistrial, while the brother waa
found guiltv of manslaughter and Is
now serving a twenty-five-year sen
tence in the state penitentiary at Me
Alester. Davis' third trial will prob
ably occur In September.

WASHINGTON, May 12. Re
opened hearings before tho

gan ami ended today with the intro
duction of testimony regarding Mr.
1'iandels' connection as counsel witn

Druse company and tho K ker-Hece-
innn Drug Stores company and a
statement by Commissioner Harlan
that Mr. Brundeis' services to the in
terstate commerce commission in the
5 per cent advance rate case were
eminently satisfactory.
Still I'nccltnin.
The subcommittee, which already
has recommended by u voto of threo
to two confirmation of the Brandels
nomination, wlil draft supplementary
report wnen today n evidence has been
printed. There was no evidence to
night aa to when a vote in the full
committee might be expected.'
Commissioner liarlun stated that
Mr. Jlrandcis was employed by thu
commission not to represent the ship
pers but the public in seeing that all
the facts in the rate case were pre
sented. He said he would have re
garded him as failing in tiifi duty if
he had withheld any Important ivm
elusions he reached in regard to the
case. .Both statements were drawn
out In answer lo criticisms of Mr,
Brandeis because in his closing argu
ment of the case ho said tho net op-
erating revenues of the carriers were
too small.
'It never occurred to me and I have
never heard any of my colleagues
criticise his action, Mr. Harlan said.
WALLACE IS FREE
OF THEFT CHARGE
Circumstantial Evidence
Fails to Convict Man
of Stealing Grain.
Circumstantial evidence failed to
convict Earl Wallace of a charge of
burglary when his trial was held yes
terday In the district court. The Jury
returned a verdict or not guilty with
in a short time and Wallace waa ac
quitted.
Wallace was accused tho theft of
two hundred bushels of oats and
quantity of corn from D. M. Trees last
January. J. 8. Adams was charred
with complicity in the stealing, but
became Involved In a Job of cattle
stealing and forfeited his bond in the
sum of $1,000 when he left the city.
County Attorney J. P. Kvers fought
the case stubbornly, but had no real
facts to submit.
Following the completion of the
case. Judge George Crump ordered
a recess of court until further call.
It Is probable no other cases will be
heard before Monday, when the trial
of William Baber, chanced with the
murder of two federal officers, will
be called.
Twice before Juries failed to agree
on a verdict in this case. It Is ex
pected tho trial will continue the bet
ter part of the week.

EXPERT TELLS OF
POSSIBILITIES OF
NEXT NEWSPAPER
(BY THE MAN AildfT TOWN)
THK evening session at Conven
tion hall was larvelv attended bv
the members of the association. The
first speaker was M rle Thorpe, Dean
of the school of Journalism in the
University of Kansas, his address
Mr. Thorpe covered a great deal of
territory, giving a blrdseye view of
the immense possibilities of the coun
try newspaper. He handled the sub
ject without gloves, declaring that It
stands at the bottom of credit rating,
and that banks regard such publica
tions as their pooreht risks. This has
been because of the ease with which
such ventures have been launched.
and the inefficient manner In which
the business end has been carried on.
At the present time scientific meth
ods are being employed more than ever
before, and In the Imsinem readjust
ment leaks are being stopped, and ad
vertising secured upon the busts of
service actually rendered.
The need of co-operalion with ad
vertisers so that the advertisement
will actually sell thj goods whs par-
tiularly emphasized. Mr. Thorpe
showed that the sums spent In adver
tising in this country would every
year build three Panamu canals or
pay the national debt. He also showed
that the correspondents of country
papers may be utilized in soliciting
both subscriptions and educating their
own communities as to the advant
ages of newspaper publicity. The ad
dress gave new vision to many, who
spoke approvingly of the methods
urged, at the close of the address.
, Newspaper liurcuii.
1'he matter of most vital Interest
discussed by the speuker was the work
of the Central Newspaper Bureau of
Kansas. The object of this burenu Is
to secure national advertising- which
heretofore has gone largely to the
magazines. Contracts for advertising
are made directly by the bureau, and
distributed among the papers of the
Etato, according to rigid tests. They
must prove that they can sell the
foods they advertise before they can
Miare in the contract already made.
Mr. Thorpo would liko to extend thin
bonanza so as to include the country
papers of Oklahoma.
Mnni.son Sicak.
J. C. Morrison, editor of the Mortis
Tribune, at Morris, Minn., was the
second speaker. His address was too
technical to be of interest to any ex
cept those directly interested In tho
cost problems connected with the
rnwspaper business, nut nuu aaver
tisers been present, to see exactly the
expense encountered In putting forth
their own material, there would be a
belter understanding all around. It
was a strong address tnrouhout and
illustrated with statlhtlcs tuai were
unanswerable.

Incidentally This Is Also

It may be surprising to many peo
ple of Tulsa to learn that our city
bus the largest telcphono number in
the United States. The telephone
number of the campaign headquar
ters of the Holy Family Catholic
church is 100,000. This is also the
amount the parish seeks to raise for

The work of listing and classifying
the names of the prospective suu

A communication from E. E.

that tho 1917 convention be held in
Oklahoma City, Is scheduled to be
presented to the association this aft
ernoon, but there were rumors lust
night that Oklahoma City's represen

forward on account of the hundreds
of editors of the state who go to Ok

at the state fair.

EIGHT thousand people, two-thirds
of whom were children, flocked
to the fairgrounds yesterday to stage
and to witness the unnual May festival
of the Tulsa public school system. A
fair, although windy, day helped make
the occasion the most successful one
ever held.
The grandstand was packed with
spectators, police being necessary to
prevent overcrowding the stadium.
Children and grown-ups flooded the
track, the arena and every spot In
sight of the sport.
At first sight It seemed that every
thing was white, white dresses, white
tents, white trousers, white lines and
white caps. As the program prog
ressed, however, tho effect was en
hanced when every event brought
some new color scheme. Green, red,

occupied the immense field at differ

The Mavday drills and exercises
were perfectly executed by a fair ma
jority of the school children of the

program and close of the day.

Army men here are of the opinion
that if tho stories of the so-called
conference between Langhorne and
the bandits arc true. It must result In
failure. Ueemer, if alive, must bo
rescued by force, which must call for
a sudden dash toward the place where
the bandits are said to huve their
