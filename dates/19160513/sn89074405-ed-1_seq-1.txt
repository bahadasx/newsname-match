partmeflt t6r' aeroplane mail service
on seven routes in Alaska and one
in Massachusetts developed only one
bidder. D. L. Byers of Idltarod,
Alaska, offered to undertake service
for year between Seward and Idl
tarod a. distance of 880 miles, for
$45,600., The department will con
sider its acceptance.
Department, officials attribute the
lack of bids to the fact that Ameri
can aeroplane manufacturers are
busy on "contracts for the European
belligerents. and most of them have
sold their products Car In advance.
One concern .wrote Postmaster Gen
eral Burleson that existing contracts
with the United States government
stood in the tray of Its making a bid.
The department has learned, it was
said today, that some manufacturers
will consider the aero mall routes
later and another call for bids prob
ably will be Issued when there are
indications that responses will be
forthcoming.
The seven Alaskan routes proposed
would cover much of the territory.
The cost of overland transportation
on most of them is high, In some In
stances as much as $100,000 a year.
The Seward-Iditarod route costs now
$22,866.
The Massachusetts route on which
bids were asked is from New Bedford
to Nantncket. Its cost to the govern
ment now is $28,000 a year.

Window Smashing Will not

"It won't be necessary for women to

their rights when this war is over,"
said Miss Criatobel Pankhurst to a
correspondent" of the Associated Press
during her visit here for .the purpose
of forming a-closer organization of
the women of. Italy with those of
Prance and England.
"This war ia helping the cause of
women wonderfully," she continued.
"We are helnliig the men with all
our might, with all our strength, and
I am sure they will appreciate this
fact when the. war is over. Besides,
Europe then' will be mentally and

it was before tho war started. There

"THis' mental male revolution- was
sorely^' peeded both in England and
In Germany. I feel that in helping
to down Germany, as the women of
England, France, Italy and Russia are
doing,, by their physical work, we
are putting down the great enemy of
Womankind. The kaiser, you know,
lias always frustrated the efforts of
German women to. rise from their
subordinate position, and he typifies
the attitude of the German men. At
that, however, the German women
Will have to fight out their own. salva
tion after the war, along with the
men. They won't get any help from
US'. There has been too much Inter
nationalism heretofore. Now, It will
be a matter for each nation to solve
many of its own problems and in par
ticular the' German nation.
"England has been driven out of
conservatism, at last. We women have
shown English men that we are worth
something, that we are not Inferior
creatures. I am sure that if women
had had a nay in the conduct of the
war England would have been ready'
jqulcker. One of our misfortunes has
been that the young men, the open
minded men, have gone to the front
to fight leaving the' old, slow minded
men, in charge. Take the case of the
effort to get steel helmets for the
men ao that they might be protected
from bullets and especially from bits

the old men in England were still dis

commission on social service, which
declared that preference should be
given union labor in all matters af
fecting employment "in so far as its
methods are just and in so far as tha
rights of unorganized men are not in

Saratoga Springs, N. Y., May 13.—
The preferential employment of union
workmen was opposed before the
general conference of the Methodist
Episcopal church, when discussion of
the report of the church social com
mission, which recommended endorse

The proposal, introduced yesterday,
involves the abandonment of "the
open shop" which has prevailed in

book concern.
United States Judge J. M. Killits
of Toledo, Ohio, opposed preferential
employment.
"The open shop," he said, "is the

BIG PROFITS MADE
OFF WAR IN AUSTRIA
Vienna, April 30—(Correspondence
of The Associated Press)—Austria's
two greatest iron and steel corpora
tions have just published their bal
ance-sheets for last year, and both
show huge profits.
The Alpinen Montan'gesellschaft
shows a clear profit of nearly four
million dollars as compared with leas
than $1,800,000 in 1914. The divi
dend paid was 21 per cent. In. 1914
it was only 11 per cent. The board of
administration fees and salaries and
other allowances amounted to con
siderably more than 8300,000 dollars.
The second corporation, the Oester
relchischen Berg and Huettenwerks
gesellschaft also did very well last
year, making a clear profit of 81.700,
000 Which was 8600,000 more than In
the preceding year. The dividend de
clared was 18 per cent against 12 1-2
per cent in 1914. These are the high
eat profits made since the corporation
was organised. The principal stock
holder is the Archduke Fredecik at.
present commander-in-chief of the
Austro-Hungarian forces in the field
and reputed to be the wealthiest mem
ber of the Hapsburg imperial family,
next to the emperor.
The total number of employes 1a
14,600. and the aggregate wages for
the year amounted to leas than 16,
000,00.0 crowns, (88,200.000) which
works out at' an average of $280 a
year, for each person, not much
more than four dollars a week. The
total payroll Is, as the Vienna Ar
belter-Zeitung points out leas than
double, the amount of the profits.

It Is Interesting to note that their pro
