Nuns A.ro Arrested ly Order of
Gov. Pnrk Trammell, of
Florida.
They "Wore Teaching Colored
Children in a Colored Paro
chial School.
Southern State Made a Laughing
Stock to Rest of the
Country.
DISGRACED BEFORE THE NATION
The "Chivalrous South" has a
stain on Its escutcheon, put there
by Gov. Park Trammell, of the
sovereign State of Florida, in his
maltreatment of good, noble and
holy women even of nuns whom
every veteran of the Confederacy
honors in his heart of hearts. "The
State of Florida seems to have gone
stark mad in its bigotry," says the
Morning Star of New Orleans in
denouncing the Governor's action.
It celebrated Easter by ordering the
arrest of three Sisters of St. Jo
seph In the ancient city of St.
Augustine on Easter Monday. This
is .the disgrace that today stamps
Florida before the eyes of the na
tion. Catholic Sisters were marched
as prisoners through the streets of
the oldest Catholic city in the
United States, where the first mass
was said, where the first priest
martyrs shed their blood for the
faith, whero the first church was
erected, whero Christianity was first
preached. And what was their
crime? They taught little colored
children to read and write and to
know God, in a colored parochial
school. Yes, that is a crime in the
State of Florida!
Three years ago a law was
passed forbidding whites to teach
the col6red' in colored schools. Tho
law forbids teaching no other word
is used. Hence according to Florida
law the Catholic Bishop of Florida,
who is white, could bo marched a
prisoner through tho streets of St.
Augustine by orders of Gov. Park
Trammell if he dared teach tho
Bible to colored children in the
colored parochial school in the
anceint city.
The proscriptive law has been de
clared unconstitutional by the best
legal talent of the State, and for
three years it remained a dead let
ter, for the very slmplo reason that
the State Itself violates the law in
Its blind institution in St. Augus
tine. But now that the "Gardeens"
are in charge of the State, the law
has been Invoked. Throughout
Florida the cry is "No Catholic need
apply." This spirit of bigotry is
State-wide. It obtains everywhere,
apparently with the connivance and
consent of the decent Protestant ele
ment, who have never yet protested
against its prejudiced excesses. Hero
and there some Individual or some
journal may utter a word of con
demnation, but the manhood of the
State seems to be paralyzed with
fear of the banded, blind bigots.
Hence the silence In the face of tho
Injustice and the violation of
American principles.
On Easter Monday the whlto
bigots urged six ignorant negroes
to petition the Government to en
force the unjust and dead law.
These negroes are D. G. Adger, H.
H'. Johanson, N. "Williams, Robert
Houston, H. G. Tye and J. A. Jack
son. TJ10 Governor was moved to
action, and at his order Sheriff
Perry, of St. John's county, arrested
the Sisters. The law invoked is
meant to keep the negro in ignor
ance, hence in subjection, by closing
to him tho public school. Tho Sis
ters of St. Joseph taught in a
parochial school. The Governor
was powerless in the matter. He is
tho servant of the bigots and had
to do their bidding under penalty
of losing his job. "Thus," says the
Morning Star, "is Florida made a
Pariah among tho States of the
Union, a laughing stock to the rest
of the country. Florida invites set
tlors. But it is no place for men
Who love fair play and justice, who
stand squarely on American princi
ples of liebrty, so long as the Stato
Is controlled by so-called men who
hate justice and trample on the
rights of fellow men."
In an issue soon after the arrests
the St. Augustine Meteor said:
"What are .we coming to?" "What
next?" and .other inquisitive ques
tions are being asked, one of an.
other, by tho citizens of St. August
tine. Is the mother city of tho na
tlon to set the pace for sensational
ism? .Certain it Is that in the ar
rest. Easter Monday, of three Sisters
of St. Joseph, for training tho little
negro child to read and write and
to comprehend the importance of
righteous living, through the medi
um of religious understanding, not
only the city of St. Augustine, but
the State of Florida at large, win
fall heir to a dint of most undesir
able publicity. The Sisters of St.
Joseph's Convent for a great many
years have been tutoring colored
children along educational and to-
ligious lines In their own private
school building on DeHaven street
Now it seems that six negroes pe
titioned Gov. Trammel to have the
Sheriff arrest the Sisters upder the
provisions of the law passed in
1913, to the effect that white per
sons should be prohibited from
teaching negroes, and the Governor
commanded the officer of tho law to
proceed with the arrest, which he
did. The law under which the ar
raet made was passed ostensi
bly for th purpose of changing the
management of a negro school
which was being conducted at Or
ange Park. At the tlmo of Its pas
sage it was understood that the law
was unconstitutional, but It seems
never to have been put to the test.
However, to be on the safe side, the
late Bishop Kenny took the matter
up with learned legal lights, to see
If It would affect the Sisters In con
tinuing the work which they had
conducted for so many years, and
was advised that the law was uncon
stitutional. But It has been re
served for this late date, after a
lapse of three years, and at a time
when our people were praying for a
cessation of agitations which have
so wrecked the peace, if not the
happiness, of our people, to spring
a sensation, and that, too, at the be
hest of six negroes.
It Is a shame that cries to very
heaven.

VINCENTIANS.
Tho general meeting of the St.

day afternoon was most gratifying
to the men who form that splendid
Catholic charity society, the
Knights of Columbus Hall being
crowded to the doors. President
John A. Doylo occupied the chair
and Secretary Bohan read the re
ports of the' twenty-ono confer
ences in this city. Short but Inter
esting addresses were made by
Rev. Father Eugene Donahoe, Rev.
Father Deppen and Dr. Felix
Gaudln, of New Orleana, who ex
pressed surprise over what he heard
and told of what the St. Vincent do
Paul Society was doing in tho Cres
cent City. The reports showed that
In the twenty-one conferences thero
are 1,328 active and 338 subscrib
ing members. During the past
three months 265 families, embrac
ing 089 persons, have been the
beneficiaries of the society, and
liorn still rATnnln KIR fntnlllna unrl
364 people on the relief roll. Thef
visits made numbered 1,073 and
the money disbursed among the
poor of the city without regard to
creed, color or nationality amounted
to $2,083.64. This is certainly a
showing that stamps the St. Vin
cent de Paul as Louisville's greatest
'charity society.

ENGLISH GOVERNMENT
Adds Another Awful Chapter to Its Longi and Bloodthirsty History by Its Whole
sale Murder of Patriotic Irishmen.
Men Who Were Shot Without Fair Trial Compared to
Declaration of Independence.
"BRITIAN SAME OLD TYRANT" SAYS SURPREME JUSTICE DANIEL COLAHAN
Day by day the English Govern
ment adds another chapter to its
bloody history in Ireland, the
wholesale shooting of the Irish
revolutionists being chronicled in
our daily press until such a wave
of indignation and protest from
the people far and wide has oven
frightened the pro-English press on
this side of the water, Henry Wat-
terson, the CoujIerJournaleditor
and John Bull loyalist, even balk
ing at the latest outrage of the
British Government, characterizing
the murder of Pearce and his fol
lowers as another episode of Eng
land's brutality and stupidity. Sir
Roger Casement was captured, as
alleged, through tho plotting of
Secret Service agents of the United
States Government. Immediately
following, the capture of Casement
tho pro-English press and paid
emissaries of Great Britain cir
culated far and wide that Sir Roger
was insane, etc., and that the Eng
lish Government would probably
confine him in an Insane asylum,
not referring In any way to the
recent occurrence when England
offered a bribe of $5,000 to have
him assassinated.
When the Dublin revolution
started, after an attempt of the
British to search and disarm the
Irish Volunteers, the pro-English
hastily and without Investigation
characterized tho outbreak as the
insane folly of ignorant fanatics,
but when the truth was revealed
and the leaders shown to be men of
learning and representative Irish
men this same press veered to an
other tack. Another favorite"
phrase of the paid press bureau is
to advertise England as "tho friend
of the little and oppressed nations,"
while again she is characterized in
the present war as fighting the bat
tles of civilization. And this, too,
dfter her long and bloodthirsty
career as the oppressor of Ireland,
India, South Africa, robbing the
Boers and murdering the flower of
that nation to pave the way for a
downright theft of valuable mining
concessions. In India sho showed
herself the friend of the oppressed
by firing natives from the mouth of
cannon for rebelling against the
starvation methods of John Bull.
"Murder" Is the word Americans
of Irish descent and Irish birth
are using In referring to the execu
tion by the British Government of
Irish volunteers who rebelled
against it and endeavored to set up
a new Irish republic.
Justifying their use of tho word,
they point to parallel upon parallel
in American history. Tho declara
tion of Irish independence, framed
and signed by Patrick H. Pearco,
Thomas McDonagh, Eamonn Ceannt,
James Connolly, Joseph Plunkett,
B. McDiarmad and Thomas Clarke,
Is declared by them to bo on the
same high plane with the American
Declaration of Independence The
Irish signers of the Declaration of
Irish Independence have been conr
derailed as traitors. Peace, Mc
Donagh, Plunkett and Clarke have
been shot; Connolly Is held a pris
oner, and only McDiarmad escapes.
They are still at largo and, Irish
Volunteers in this country declare,
carrying on the work their com
patriots started with them, isoin
McNeill, Irish Volunteor head, Is
also at liberty.
Editor Ford, of the Irish World,
finds a- paiallel in the case of
John Brown. He says: "The mem
ory of the martyrs who died that
Ireland might live a full life will
nerve Irishmen to heroic deeds in
the last and victorious fight against
England. On-the eve of our oirll
war, Wendell Phillips, the Amerl-
a
can orator who so often pleaded
the cause of Ireland, delivered a
lecture entitled 'Harper's Forry.'
Theiubiect matter of It was John
BrowiJBJhlow at slavery. What
DendelFThllllps said on that occa
sion Is applicable to tho Irish re
volt. "Well, men say he failed. . . .

erty knows nothings- but victories.

ORPHAN SOCIETY.
The Catholic Orphan Society, hav
ing in charge St. Vincent and St.
Thomas Orphanages, is making act
ive preparation for the picnic to
be held on the Fourth of July on
the grounds of St. Vincent's Asylum,
Payne and Cavewpod avenue. An
executive committee has been ap
pointed from tho central society to
supervise the affair, as follows:

A. J. Chappell, of St. Louis Ber-
trand parish, has been chosen as
Chairman of tho General Committee,
and John P. Cassllly Secretary.
Both these gentlemen were intro
duced to tho opening meeting on
Monday night, and both made ad
dresses expressing their great in
terest in this work and their lnten-
tlon to push It as earnestly as pos-'
slble. Messrs. Chappell and Cassllly
have both been connected in an of-
flclal capacity with St. Louis Ber-
trand branch of the society, the
former as Secretary and the latter
as President, and are familiar with
the needs of the institutions.
At the preliminary meeting in
terest and enthusiasm were dis
played by all present, and a favor
able indication was the large num
ber who attended in response to
the call from the pulpits of tho
English speaking congregations on
the preceding Sunday. Much work
is to be done, and a cordial Invita
tion is extended to all Catholics to
attend the meetings. The Executive
Committee announced the appoint
ment of Chairmen of some of tho
standing committees, and - they are
all ladles and gentlemen well known
in Catholic circles, who will do their
part In making tho picnic a great
success. Tho Chairmen appointed

God for John Brown, that he has

John Dovoy, editor of the Gaelic
American, saya of the executions:
''These men were murdered and
Ireland before this war Is over will
exact a heavy toll for tho butchery.
Every man of them was taken dn
arms,- wearing uniforms?- and -were
soldiers of an Irish army. . . .
These gallant Irishmen were mur
dered for tho purpose of striking
terror Into Ireland, but tho attempt
will fail as all such exhibitions of
English brutality and savagery
have failed In the past. The men
she has butchered are the political
Baints of Ireland today."
Supremo Court Justice Daniel F.
Colahan, of New York, said: "No
greater contrast could be found
than that between tho humane and
wise course pursued by the United
States toward the defeated South
erners and that which England is
now following with Jthe Irishmen
who were taken in arms, battling
against her. America was merci
ful, and conciliation followed de
feat. England is merciless, and
will reap the whirlwind of the seed
which she now sows. The deaths
of-the Irish leaders are but further
proof that It is the same old Eng
land, with one law through all the
centuries for the Sir Edward Car
sons and the General Frenches and
another one for the mere Irish

fear had turned England's head for
the moment and that she was strik
ing blfndly. But the deaths ot
Plunkett, William Pearce, Daly and
O'Hanrahan Friday, and now of
Major McBride, Indicate that the
policy of terrorism and savage re
pression has been deliberately
adopted, and that Ireland Is to be
engulfed in the blood of her bright
est and her bravest. TyraiKs
without number acted thus In other
ages, and inevitably have failed.
The fires of liberty have been re
lighted in Ireland, and will glow
more fiercely with every fresh death
until tho last vestige of English
rule is destroyed."
OAXnOLlO KNIGHTS.
The Catholic Knights of America
opened the nineteenth Supreme
Council here Tuesday morning and

BULL M00SERS
Issue Their Def 1 to Those In Con
trol of tho Republican
iPnrty.
Must Take Roosevelt or Ills Per
sonal Selection For Mooscrs
Support.
Renowned' Political Critic Art
vises Gov. Stanley and Stato
Leaders.
HALDEMAN SHOULD WITHDRAW
National Chairman Perkins, ot
the Progressive party, came out in.
a statement Wednesday which can
bo construed as tho ultimatum of
tho Bull Moose party. Tho latter
want, first of all, to see that Roose
velt Is given tho Republican nom
ination, but on account' of tho
Rough Rider's weak showing in
several of the recent Presidential
primaries they will be willing to
withdraw his name, but must glvo
him the right to namo tho nominee.
Mr. Perkins puts it in a more subtle
way when he says the Republican
nominee must be acceptable to tho
Progressive party and principles, In
other words the G. O. P. choice
must be the choice of Roosevelt,
who is the Progressive party, and
the nominee must bind himself to
obey Roosevelt In everything and
have no opinions but the opinions
of Roosevelt. In the event that tho
Republican leaders refuse to accept
this dictation the Bull Moose con
vention will name Johnson, of Cali
fornia, as the standard-bearer and
react the scenes of 1912 anything
to beat the Republican party.
In tho Republican convention tho
Roosevelt delegates will, on tho first
ballot and as many succeeding bal
lots as their idol will permit, cast
their votes for his nomination, but
If they are in a hopeless minority
then It is the intention for Roose
velt to offer the names of ex-Gov.
Hadley, of Missouri, or Gen. Leon
ard Wood as his compromise can
didates. On these he will stand
pat and there Is no possible chance
of securing his support for Root,
Hughes, Weeks, Burton, McCall or
any of the foremost candidates. Tho
candidate in the Republican conven
tion must bo Roosevelt, Hadley or
Wood, and if neither of these aro
chosen you will see the Rough Rider
and all of his forces adjourn to tho
camp of the Bull Moosers and imme
diately plan the nomination of ex
Gov. Johnson, of California, on a
third party ticket.
" When the proposed harmony plan
of the Stanley and local organiza
tions was announced the Kentucky
Irish American went on record as
saying that everyone of tho selec
tions for the convention choices
were satisfactory to tho average
Democrat with the exception of the
proposed plan to select Gen. W. B.
Haldcman as successor of National
Committeeman Urey Woodson. It
was contended in these columns
that the greedy policy of tho
Courier-Journal and Times in local
and State politics had not won
many friends or supporters, while
Urey Woodson had outlived his
usefulness to tho party and been.
sufficiently honored. This being
the situation it would be better for
all concerned for both to withdraw,
or agree on a neutral choice. That
this is tho popular view is shown
in the following letter of "Savo
yard," the Washington political
critic, who addresses the following
advice to Gov. Stanley, while at the
same time stating that he Is not a
friend or admirer of Woodson's:
Don't do it, Owsley don't you

have fallen on times when the com
mon people will not tolerate a ma
chine not even tho wretched Re
publicans, unclrcumclzCHi and unre
generate as they are. Bo Governor
of all tho people, and as leader of
tho Democratic party, be m-ad of
no faction. Did you ever fiear of
ono Luke Lea, of Tennesseo? Ho
is a warning. Aro you fatuous fool
enough to make him an example?
God forbid.
Your environment, Owsley. I ad
mit, is embarrassing. I can and do
appreciate It and I sympathize with
you. You know and I know every
body knows that Willie Haldeman
is a spoiled child who has to bo
amused to keep him out of mischief.
The novelty has about vanished
from that gorgeous military title
that voluptuates his name, and he
is fretting for another ribbon to
wear on tho lapel of bin coat. Look
ing round and about he saw that
Urey Woodson was National Com
mitteeman and ho grabbed for that.
Ho loves to strut across the stage.
Ho is infatuated with tho limelight.
Tho tulip trapping and superb cir
cumstances of glorious and pompous
especially pompous bossism have
Irresistible fascination for tho "Gen
eral." And so you tossed him the bone
with the disastrous result that a
majority of over 30,000 was de
pleted to a majority of less than
500. Owsley, can you afford to
repeat that? That Is the way it
looks to an exile Kentucklan way
off here in the District of Columbia.
COULD BE WORSE.
There are 1,525 churches, with
