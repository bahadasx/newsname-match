MEDICAL MEN
MEET AT NEW
SOUTHERN
HOTEL
Parish Physicians Discuss
Matters of Importance to
Health and Sanitation.
DR. DOWLING IS GUEST
FOR THE EVE NING
Morbidity .Reports and Sta
tistics, Births:and Deaths,
Difficult to Handle.
The 'St. Tammany Parish Medical
Society held its regular monthly
iPeeting at the New Southern Hotel,
in Covington, Wednesday evening
The meeting took palce in the din
ing hall, immediately after the din
ner, which was served at 7:30 p. m.,
and at which- informal talks height
ened the interest with which subjects
were discussed :ater In the evening.
More thah usual interest was
awakened by the presence of Dr
Oscar Dowling, who was the guest
of the evening and who spoke very
interestingly upon subjects th it he
considers of vital importance to the
welfare of the State.
The following members were in
attendance: H. D. Bulloch, presi
dent; C. W. Davidson, secretary; J.
F. Polk, H. E. Gautreaux, W. K. Ney
A. G. Maylie, J. 'F. Bouquoi, F. J
Rhomer, F. C. Farmer, W. E. Van
Za.ndt.
Dr. 'BnUloc presided, and on me
tion of Dr. Gautreaux the meetigr
was turned over to Dr. Dowling any'
a round table discussion of subje
Dr. Dowling has always been an
enthusiastic worker in the interest
of the State, and be it a meeting o'
medical men or a young ladies
sociable, he usually manages to say
something in the way of better
health conditions and the uplift of
humanity.
Dr. Dowling said he was especial
ly glad to be present, because it gave
him an opportunity to put in a stroke
for more complete morbidity returns
He thought Covington was a fine
place and that great things were in
store for this country, if the people
could be aroused to its advantages
and opportunities. Its situation and
reported healthfulness was an ad
vertisement of great value if it was
backed up by sanitation. He hoped
the people would put in the water
works -system. That it must come
sooner or later any how. That re
cent failures of applicants for enlist
ment in the army to meet the phy
sical requirements showed the great
necessity of surrounding the grow
ing youth with very means of healthy
development. He cited an incident
where but 66 applicants out of 1001
passed the physical examination.
"Very recently," said Dr. Dowling
"to get an opinion from the doctors
went sent a card, as you may know,
to each, asking for an opinion in
Sfavor of or against the payment of
fees to the physicians for sending in
of birth and death certificates and
epidemiology reports. Up to this
morning we have had 822 replies.'
They are divided as follows: In
favor of payment of fee for records
of births sad deaths, 578; opposed,
244. For epidemiology reports: In
favor of Tees. 502; apposed, 310." C
"A few stated that it was imma
terial, and special reasons were given
in 84 eases for the opinions for and
against."
Dr. Dowling stated that quite a
number of physicians were opposed
to the occupation tax. "One physi
cian," he said, "makes 'the statement
that a large part of the practice of t
every doctor is charity work. There
is something in this, too. The money a
value of time is a rational concept.
It is just as logical for the profes
sional as the commercial worker."
Again speaking of the recordation
of births and deaths, Dr. Dowling t
said: "Michigan and Kentueky pay C
the physician or midwife for birtl e
certl8cates. In Michigan, 50 centr
is the fee for the physician and 2"
cents for the local registrar." * *
"The point most important is that l
we get the reports. Prevention of
communicable disease, I consider the
most imperative of al the obliga
tions of the State Board of Health T
That we have the actual knowledge
necessary to save lives, to lessen the
number of cases of illness and do t
not put it into effect is a disgrace to g
our civilization. 'But without records b

FIREMEN'S PARADE
SHOWS A BETTER
PREPAREDNESS
A Large Number of Autos
Line Up, and Cartoons
Were Carried Appealing
for Votes for Waterworks.
The F.remen's parade showed that
the department Is in much better
condition for fire-fighting than it has
ever been. While the parade did
I not nearly come up to the parades
that have been made in days agone,
yet there was in it more to comfort
the resident with a home that might
need protection from the flames at
any moment. The chemical engine
being mounted on a motor car that
can reach a burning building in time
to save it, gave the property holder
a. feeling of greater security.
The parade was over two bloake,
long, and- there were quite a number
of autos in it. W. R. Badon lent a
feature of humor to it, because he
is so frail that the feminine charm
Just boiled over him in his dipguise
as a -bu pn lass. The cartoons ask
ing for votes for the waterworks
seemed to appeal to the majority of
spectators, 4=kd. it to be hoped they
will not have asked in vain.
JA very large crowd attended the
entertainment and ball, there being
some from Mandeville, Abita and
Madisonville. The entertainment
program amused the audience and
three-quarters of as mile north of the
Bonfouca public road in the building
formerly occupied as a saloon.
"JACOB LEVY."
We protest against a grant of li
cenae to the said Levy for the fol
lowing reasons:
1st. The location is not specifi
cally described, there having been
several former saloons in the same
place.
2d. The said Levy has been gull
ty of violation of laws relative to
selling of liquors in the N;nth -Ward,
and also in his Slidell saloon. He
was fined for violating the Sundgy
and Gay-Shattuck laws by Judge
Lancaster of the Distrc.t Court, as
the record will show.
3d. The said Levy was found
guilty and fined and jai ed by the
Mayor of Slidell, for a violation of
the Sunday law in his Slidell saloon.
4th. The Gay-Shattuck law ex
pressly forbids police juries, and
other authorities, to grant t* any
person a permit to sell intoxicating
liquors who shall have belea f'ound
guilty of a violation of said law a
second time. * * " "And shall,
upon a second conviction for a viola
tion of this section. :,r any o; the
provisions o: this A't, . be perma
nently deptived taPercater of the
privilege of conducting a bzrnoonm,
cabaret, coffee house, nwe."
5th. We believe that theb pst
record of the said Levy :t the town
of Slidell, also in the Ninth Ward of
this parish, as above -hown, is a
good and sufficient reason for yoi'r
honorable 'body to refuse the appll
cation.
6th. We further submit that the
record of negro saloo.s profes them
objectionable and undesirable. Tbh.y'

questiofable criminals, and the hab
itutes a mnace and disgraeg, to any
