WASHIXGTOX, D. C, May 1 3. Weeks of tlitlercnce between
the house and senate on the army reorganization bill, and days of dead
lock between the conference committees, came to an uid today with
the announcement of a ccmpromise plan acceptable to both sides. ,
At the conclusion of a final conference today in which the congress
men and senators adjusted the differences that have held them widely
apart, announcement of the new army plan was made. in some detail. "
The regular army will have a peace strength of 200,000, with pro
visions so that in time of war it may be easily expanded to 254,000, and
agreement on this has been definitely reached, according to the announce
ment. :;:' i:y: :'.-'''"'"'"' ; -
The regular army will be composed of 65 regiment of infantry and
25 of cavalry, 21 field artillery, a coast artillery corps numbering 30,000
and a signal corps of 3387, including the aviation corps, i .
One feature of the bill as it is now taking shape is the plan to
more than double the officers of the aviation corps .The number will
be increased from 60 to 148. c
The plan as approved by the conferees contemplates attaining the
full peace strength of the army within five years. - '.
The general officers of the line are increased by four major-gcneralj

feature is that the "rider" calling or government operation of nitrate
plants is accepted. - ' . ' ' " f " , ; 1
Under the compromise plan, enlistment is to be three years with
the colors as regulars, and four in the reserve. ' ' '
The senate plan of a volunteer reserve has been eliminated, leaving
the reserve to. the militia, which will, be federalized, and the "militia
strength is to be 425,000. j ,y -

Officers Here
of Increase
Word of the big Increase agreement
conveyed to officers at army head
quarters this morning brought rejoic-
u$ una oaa it not been received with
in the conservative precincts of the
army halls would beyond a doubt have
Drougni out snouts of delight.
"That's great .news," commented of
ficer after officer, while excimMnn
or some Army," and others similar
came irom the enlisted men detailed
to duty , about the hrt nn or tor r9
fices.
If the proposal goes through it will
mean vast increases In the armv. on
of the most noticeable of which will
be In the infantry division, which will
be more than doubled with - 60 regi
ments increased to 125.
Companies of field artillery will be
Increased 2 1-2 times, making the pres
ent strength of 6300 men into a total
of 21,000. The field artillery now
has only six regiments.
Coast - artillery strength, which is
170 companies at present- containing
19,321 men, will be raised to 30,000
men, making an increase of 12,000 ap
proximately. (
Cavalry will, be increased by 10
regiments over the present standing
of 15 regiments. No change is stated
for engineers.
Signal Corps companies now con
taining nearly 6000 men will be in
creased by approximately 2000 men.
The entire army, from a standing of
111,305 on Airll 30 of this year. Is
Increased by almost 100,000 for peace
times. It is interesting at this time
to remember that the last bia: Increase
in the American army came about the
beginning of the Spanish war when a
force of 65.000 was raised to 100.000.
which number has been gradually
raised since that time to the present
strength given above. -
If the army r,ere raised now to Its
full possibility, it would be but 120,000
plus 6C00 for quartermaster corps and
538 J for hospital corps." These last
two, divisions are now nearly ud to
standard strength.
Officers will be increased In. num
ber with a lavish hand If the bill
passes. ' For example. Instead of nine
major-generals .there will be 13; in
stead of 27 btlgadler-generals there
win be 46, and bfflcera on the general
ataff will number 52 Instead of 38 as
at present. . .
The aviation corps is now comnosed
of 60 officers and 260 men. The num
ber of officers will be Increased by 83.
