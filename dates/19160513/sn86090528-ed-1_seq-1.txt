CAPTAIN
PUNISHED
Oy L'nlted Presa.
Hague, May 13. Well Informed cir
cles in Berlin state the belief exists
that the commander of the submarine
w'hich torpedoed the Sussex has been
severely punished, because he de
ceived the German government in his
report of thb torpedoing. This deceit
has aroused public indignation and hu
miliation in view of American evi
dence. Anti-American propagandists have
been squelched through alleged addi
tional submuriua concesHions by Ger
many to America's demands.

Tomorrow, the second Sunday in
May is Mother's Day. The beautiful

founded the Motheros Day Internatlon-
assir-auon to proviuo u. ...a.,
organized support lor tne losicnng oi
the movement. Thanks largely to her
efforts. Mother's Day has become
recognized Institution as the day on
w hich each of us should pause to ack
knowledge our debt of affection and
gratitude to "the best mother who ever
lived," on which we should be with
her if we can, aud, if we unfortu
nately cannot, should make a point
of sending her a message of affection
and cheer.
la co-operation with the effort to
foster the observance of Mother's Day,
the Western Union Telegraph Com
pany has provided special telegraph
blanks, appropriately decorated with
an artistic design of carnations and
bearing the legend "Mother's Doy," on
which all messages of those w ho wish
to send a word of greeting to their
mothers on this occasion, by day let
ter or night letter or in a short tele
gram, will be delivered.
The emblem of the day is the white
carnation, and it is the hope of the
r c,.a(lnn that It will
-
be worn by every one as a tribute
" ' . , ,,
of respect, not only for his own moth-
er. but also for all the gentle and
noble motherhood of the land.

BOY HURT
ON BICYCLE
As a result of a most peculiar ac!
cident yesterday evening George
Bright, the nine-year-old son of Mr. and
Mrs. C. W. Bright, 828 South Third
street, met with injuries which might
easily have proven most serious.
George, aud his brother Charles,
were riding north on Seventh street on
bicycles when an automobile passed
them. A boy whose name could not
be learned, either attempted to swing
on to the auto, which is alleged to
have been traveling at a good rate of
speed, or to jump off its running
board. At any rate this boy, in swing
ing away from the auto came directly
in front of George and his bicycle. The
collision was unavoidable, George's i
wheel Btriklng'the boy in such a man-1
ner that wheel and rider were both
tnrown violently to the paved street.
George was rendered unconscious
from the effects 'of the fall. He was
carried into a nearby residence and his
parents phoned and later he was re
moved to his home and a physician
called in. The lad was severely
bruised and shaken and remained In
an unconscious condition for several
hours.
This morning the boy's father stated,
he seemed all rightj, but was very
sore from the bruises. When asked
how the accident happened the little
fellow is said to have stated that he
did not know; that tho other boy
seemed to jump from the passing auto
right in front, of him and that was the
last he knew.
BOXER BOB WILLIAMS
TO ARRIVE TONIGHT
Bob Williams, the heavy-weight
boxer of Dallas, Texas, will arrive in
Chickasha this afternoon, preliminary
to meeting Tate, the "Battling Texan."
Monday night in a ten round bout at
the Athletic association's club rooms.
Williams will work out tonight at the
Sugg theatre, meeting in the workout
a 170 pound all round athlete from
Aklron, Ohio. A wire received this
morning from Williams' trainer states
that he has been training hard and
that he will be found in fine fettle
when the gong taps on the opening
round Monday night.
This afternoon Texas Tatu worked
out before a large crpwd at the Kozy.
The big man showed himself to be in
fine shape. That he has trained hard,
but not too hard was shown in the
manner in which his big muscles
flashed and played beneath the velvet
skin.
Tate has been training for the past
several days to meet the man w flom he
fought to a draw in a ten round bout
the third time he (Tate) ever entered
the ring. Opinion is about equally
divided among the Chickasha fight
fans as to whether Tate or Williams
will be the victor. Williams out
weighs Tate, but Tate is the less beefy
of the two, running'more to sinew and
muscle. Neither has the advantage
in reach and Tate is backed by the
confidence that he will win, firmly
believing that he will be able to sing
the lullaby to Williams before the
crashing of the gong on the last round.
The management has promised not
less than fifteen rounds of fast and
furious preliminaries for Monday ev
ening preliminaries w hich will inter
est and entertain the audience before
the big gladiators enter the arena.
