Coast Artillery Arrives.
San Antonio, Texas, May 13. Two
companies of coast artillery reached
here early today and pitched camp
at Fort Sam Houston, near the mil
itia encampment. It is said at head
quarters that all of the other com
panies included in the movement will
be in by night, making a total of sev
en at this point. Four companies
have been sent from their stations to
strengthen the border forces at El
Paso and Marathon.
General Funston will reach head
quarters tonight after an absence of
more than two weeks, necessitated by
the conference with General Obregon.
He is expected to outline a program
of work by the militia by which the
state troops will be put in shape for
service within two or three weeks.
Carranzistas Sent to Border.
Dispatch of 1,500 Carranza troops
northward toward the border in the
Big Bend district of Coahuila, report
ed m border advices, was regarded by
officials here today as possibly indi
cating that the Mexican de facto gov
ernment is making renewed efforts to
capture bandits who have raided
American border towns. Reports that
the expedition might have a hostile
purpose were not regarded serious
ly by administration authorities.
They intimated that the action tend
ed to strengthen the belief that Amer
ican and Mexican military authorities
at El Paso had reached an unwritten
agreement on cooperation along the
border to prevent further bandit raids.
'o Change in .Sitnalion.
The Mexican situation showed no
signs of immediate change here to
day. President Wilson was cruising
down the Chesapeake bay on the
yacht Mayflower and did not expect
to return before Sunday or Monday.

staff, was on his way to Washington
from El Pafo to report on his confer

ister for the de facto government He
is expected here early next week and
administration officials probably will
confer at length with him before tak
ing up diplomatic discussions with
EUseo Arredondo, Carranza ambassador-designate.
War department authorities empha
sized that although General Pershing
is concentrating his forces in Mexico
and shortening his line to 216 miles,
be is ready to dash southward still
farther if definite reports should bo
received of Villa or his bandits.

THE WAR TODAY
The Douanmont region on tho
Yerdnn front, where the Germans
for more than two months past
have held fairly close to the line
of their original advance in the
February' drive, is again the scene
of desperate lighting.
Violent bombardment of French
positions in that sector yesterday
was followed by strong attacks
in which, according to the after
noon bulletin from Paris, the Ger
mans suffered heavy losses and
failed to gain any ground.
Across the Meuse, northwest of
Terdim, no infantry encounters
are reported, but the artillery is
being kept busy, firing- on both
sides being1 virtually without ces
sation. Vienna today reports continual
ly increasinif activity in the vicin

front of about 500 yards. The
British admit the loss of the
trenches, but claim that part of
them were retaken in a counter
attack. Berlin declares the Brit
ish suffered heavy casualties and
that the Germans took a number
of prisoners and several (runs.
The French have recaptured
points of vantage previously fak.
en from tiiem by the Germans
southeast of liar court.
On the Russian front, Infantry
lighting is in progress on the
Dvinsk and Jacobstadt sectors.

NEW RESERVOIR
NOW COMPLETED
Greatest Reclamation Project and
Storage System in the World
Finished in "ew Mexico.
Elephant Butte, N. M., May 13.
Work was completed here today on the
Elephant Butte dam, a United States
reclamation project, which by dam
ming the Rio Grande river, forms the
greatest storage reservoir in the
world. Construction began five years
ago. The reservoir will feed an irri
gation system that will water 185,000
acres of land in New Mexico, Texas
and Mexico.
The dam blocks a canyon of the Rio
Grande 120 miles north of El Paso.
It is the fifth of the government's
big irrigation projects and will store
the entire flow and flood of the river.
The reservoir will hold 115,000.000
cubic feet of water, which reclamation
service experts say would cover the
state of Delaware to a depth of i .To
feet.
The dam stands 318 feet high and
is 1,674 feet long. It provides a road
way across the canyon 16 feet wide
and at its base is 235 feet thick.
Territory to be irrigated by the
reservoir lies in four valleys. For each
of these a diversion dam and main
canals are being constructed. Twenty
five thousand acres of land is on the
Mexico side of the river near Juarez.
More than half of it is virgin soil, with
a small acreage owned by the govern
ment. FIRE DESTROYS HIGH
