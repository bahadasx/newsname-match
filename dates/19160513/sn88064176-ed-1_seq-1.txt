State Supt. Harris on Equalization of
Assessments.
[Inue d Jy F-deratlon of Women', Clubs.]
The most important question
that concerns us in Louisiana is
that of assessments. We areop
erating under the theory that
every man supports the govern
ment in proportion to the value
of the property found in thein.
In practice we are far removed
from this ideal. Much property
is not assessed; one individual is
assessed "up" and another down;
and there is the grossest inequali
ty as between parishes. Our tax
rates are high enough, too high, 1
but the deplorable assessment I
situation results in forcing some
individuals and some parishes to
contribute more than their share
towards the support of govern
ment while others contribute less I
than their just share; and it also
results in less money than is
needed for public purposes. 1
The schools are vitally inter
ested in this question. Their 4
proper development depends up
on its solution. We can hardly
hope to receive larger shares of I
the State and parish taxes, nor
can we expect the people to vote
special school taxes more gener
ously. The schools receive from
the State less than two dollars
per child of school age; they
should receive at least five dol
lars; yet the proportion is about
one-third of all the State taxes.
We cannot reasonably expect a
larger proportion. What is said
of State taxes can be said with
thof parish taxes. The
constitu rantees the pub
lic schools three- of the
maximum taxes that can be lev
ied in a parish, and they actually
receive much more than that in
many parishes. This is not un
generous support of education.
As to special school taxes, the
State is practically covered by
by them, the rate frequently
reaching as high as twenty-five t
mills. In other words, we are t
working fairly hard our sources ,
or revenues, and we find our- i
selves in this situation: $
1. We realize that we should
organize to prevent adult illiter
acy by providing for state-wide
compulsory school attendance,
but we lack the funds to take
care of the 150,000 to 180,000 ad
ditional children that would come
into the school.
2. We need many more high ,
schools offering suitable courses a
to our young men and women, f
but the money is raised with diffi- a
culty when the people locally are e
called upon to raise the most of i
it. b
3. Many parishes should con
tinue the work of consolidating y
the country schools and should a
extend the terms of the country -
schools, but these things cost(
much more money than is avail
able.
4. Shops, agriculture, home
economy, gymnasiums should be
required in all of the larger
schools--they are not because the S
finances will not permit.
5. All of the parishes should
provide for the medical inspec
tion of children-they have de
cayed teeth, defective vision, en
larged tonsils, malaria and other s
defects that interfere with their f
physical and also their mental C
development. These d e f e c t s
should be pointed out and remov
ed. But funds are not available a
for this important work. In U
short we appreciate our educa- n
tional needs, but we lack the P
funds to realize them. We need a
money. Our school revenues
should be almost double to place a
us in position to offer a suitable
education to every child in the e
State. This is possible only I
through a reorganized system of ,t
of assessments. And why should
anyone oppose a plan of assess
n ments that will force all property
is owners to pay taxes honestly?
. No honest man should wish his
it assessment to be 25 per cent of
the value of his property while F
1e his neighbors is 60. Taxation
should be equal and uniform, and I
d it is unreasonable in any man to I
y oppose so patent a proposition. ,
is The schools face a crises. They ;
I; cannot possibly continue their
i. onward march unless the reve
x nues are largely increased, and
this increase cannot come as the
t result of high tax rates; it must
e come, if it comes at all, through
;o larger assessments that will yield
e larger revenues. And this ad- M.
. ditional assessment should be
ý placed upon the tax dodgers and
o the under-assessed.
s If Louisiana has some clear- b
headed, patriotic sons (and she 2
has many) who can" lead us out
r of troubled waters into clear sail- '
. ing, they should now come for
y ward, for their service is sorely ,
f needed.
Efficient Man's Business.
e The community has no bribe that
will tempt a wise man. You may
raise money enough to tunnel a moun- p
tain, but you cannot raise money
s enough to hire a man who is minding
yhis own business. An efficient and "t
valuable man does what he can,
whether the community pays him for t"
it or not. The inefficient offer their
inefficiency to the highest bidder, and :u
are forever expecting to be put into
office. One would suppose they were
rarely disappointe-d.Thoreau. t
His Viewpoint.
"Mercy!" ejaculated young Mrs. Kid- ,d
der, in the midst of her reading, "Here '
Is an account of a woman who sold 44
- her baby for fifty cents." "Oh, well,"
returned her bachelor brother, who "t
had at sundry times cared for the chil- r,
I dren while his sister went shopping, .
S"all kinds of swindles are being qr
worked nowadays." - Kansas City h,
Star. "
Work for Explorers.
Vast expanses of grazing land and MC
immense forests await exploration in
the northwestern part of Paraguay, [
known as the Gran Chaco, which is P'
inhabited mostly by nomadic tribes of
- Indians. It is estimated that Para
guay has a population of 1,000,000.
in Distress.
"Oh, my day is spoiled. I came on o
without my cigarettes." "Algernon ,
will let you have some of his." "Dear
me! I can't smoke cigarettes with an
other fellah's monogram on them."- ,.

A Symbol of Health.
The Pythagorians of Ancient Greece
1 ate simple food, practiced temperance i
3 and purity. As a badge they used the I
five pointed star which they regarded
as a symbol of health. A red five point
ed star appears on each package of Mr
Chamberlain's Tablets, and still fulfils
its ancient mission as a symbol of it
health. If you are troubled with indi
gestion, biliousness or constipation,
get a package of these tablets from
r your druggist. You will be surprised e
at the quick relief which they afford. •

A Card to Owners
of Rural Telephone Lines
We are anxious to see that all lines owned by
other parties and connected with us are kept In ueach
condition as to furnish efficient service. Where the
owners of rural lines are r ble for their upkeep,
we want to co-operate with hm.
All line require a thorough oveesullng occe,
sionally if the best service is to be obtained. We
recommend that every, . line connected with us be
overhauled at least once a year, and that at least one
experienced telephone man assist in this work. The
cost of this work when aivided among all the patrons
of the line, makes the amount paid by each mat
small, and this cost will be more than offset by the
improved service.

tion are experiencing trouble with their service, we
will appreciate their talking the matter over with our
Manager or writing us fully. We will gladly do
what we can toward helping you improve the con
dition of your line.
