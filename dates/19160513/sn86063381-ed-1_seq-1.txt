He was ordained priest in 1894
and his first work was at Gunnison,
Colo. He remained in Colorado about
one year and on returning to Minne
sota he was named rector of St.
John's church at St. Cloud in 1895.
He remained in St. Cloud until his
appointment as archdeacon of Duluth
when he moved to Cass Lake. This
was about 12 years ago.
Venerable Archdeacon.
His appointment as archdeacon
gave him the title of Venerable
Archdeacon and he became president
of the standing committee. He was
placed in charge of all the missions
in the territory where there were no
resident pastors and was superin
tendent of all the Indian missions.
He was married to Miss M. Nell
Gilmer of Faribault in that city May,
1894.
Archdeacon Parshall took charge
of the Episcopal church in Bemidji
about eight years ago and held
church for several years in the Odd
Fellows hall. About six years ago
he superintended the construction of
the church here and ever since has
worked energetically decreasing the
debt of the Bemidji church.
Parents Survive.
Surviving are the wife and two
daughters, Mrs. Donald Grant and
Miss Eleanor Parshall of Cass Lake

shall of Faribault three brothers,
William of Little Falls, Arthur E. of
Devils Lake, N. D., and Dana of St.
Paul two sisters, Mrs. T. F. Robin
son of Minneapolis and Mrs. B. D.
Stein of Omaha.
He was a member of the Scottish
Rite, Knights Templar and Shrine
and was Past Grand Prelate of the
Grand Commandery. He was a life
member of the St. Cloud lodge of
Elks.
Energetic Worker.
Archdeacon Parshall was most en
ergetic in church leadership. He
was an indefatigable worker, visit
ing the Indian missions and many
other places.
There is no one but will regret
the passing of Archdeacon Parshall.
He did a man's work and did it well.
He will be missed from his accus
tomed place in life, but his memory
will ever linger in the hearts of his
friends and associates and his grave
at Faribault will be adorned with the
tender forget-me-nots of future
years.
It was well that he lived for he
was an example for all men to fol
low.
ONE OF FOREMOST IN
EPISCOPAL MINISTRY
Bishop J. D. Morrison of Duluth,
when informed of the death of Arch
deacon Parshall by the Duluth rep
resentative of the Pioneer said:
"Archdeacon Parshall was one of
the foremost men of our ministry in
the whole Northwest. He was de
voted and tireless and utterly unsel
fish in the pursuit of his duty. His
career was marked by absolute devo
tion to duty and he commanded the
respect and love and devotion of all
the people to whom he ministered.
In the diocese of Duluth he held a
commanding position. He will be
profoundly missed by the bishop, the
ARCHDEACON PARSHALL
Born Sept. 27,1867.
May 13,1916
Died
clergy and the people of the diocese
of Duluth."
PLACE WILL BE HARD
TO FILL SAYS BISHOP
"I don't see how Bishop Morrison
of Duluth can fill the place of Arch
deacon Parshall," said Bishop Ed
sall when informed of the death of
Archdeacon Parshall by a Pioneer
representative in Minneapolis this
morning.
"I'm very much shocked," added
the bishop. "Archdeacon Parshall
did much valuable work among the
Indians. He was a zealous mission
ary worker. I have known him a
long time. He was one of the few
men remaining working who was
working before the Duluth diocese in
which he worked was divided from
many dioceses."
WORLD MADE BETTER
BECAUSE HE WAS IN IT
"Though not personally acquainted
with Archdeacon Parshall, having
been in the city only a few months,
I have come to know much about him
and to appreciate him, for what he
was and for what he has done," said
Rev. B. D. Hanscom of the Methodist
church today when informed of the
death of Archdeacon Parshall. "He
will be greatly missed. He was
much beloved. He had not lived in
vain. Surely the world has been
made better because he has been in
it. Our sympathy goes out to the
widow and children at this time, and
may the God of all comforts, who
comforted the hearts of his people,
comfort their hearts in this, the hour
of their great sorrow."
ARCHDEACON PARSHALL
WAS A MAN'S MAN
"The death of Archdeacon Par
shall moves our community with a
feeling of deep sorrow and loss," said
Kev. Lester P. Warford of the Pres
byterian church when informed of
the death of Archdeacon Parshall, by
a Pioneer Representative. "Words
are very inadequate to express our
appreciation of the life and service
of one of God's good men, but never
theless they express in a small way
the large place which Rev. Parshall
had in the heart of our city.
"As pastor of the Presbyterian
church, I have been in Bemidji but
a short time. However, I have been
here long enough to know and ap
preciate the worth of Rev. Parshall's
fine service. He was primarily a
man's man. One who when passing
through a train left a glow in the
eyes of his friends which seemed to
say, 'He is my brother.' He had the
spirit of unselfish sacrifice, and trav
eled without question through the
length and breadth of our county
to minister to the sorrowing and
needy. He was a broad man who
served without regard to cast or
creed. He did not- choose the at
tractive places to the neglect of the
remote but with that generous
heart of a true missionary filled the
niche which God placed at his door
and questioned not his own prefer
ence or desire. Through the pass
ing years he has been living in our
midst as a man among men. One
whom the stranger and traveler loved
to greet. One whom men sought out
when they came to town because of
his breadth of sympathy and fellow
ship. These fine qualities have en
deared Archdeacon Parshall not only
to his own church and following, but
to the larger field which stretches
SCOOP
THE CUB
REPORTER
through all churches and widens Its
circle into the unknown and un
recognized depths of service."
WAS A POWER OF
GOOD AMONG PEOPLE
"I learn with sorrow that Arch
deacon Parshall died this morning."
said Rev. Fr. John J. T. Philippe of
St. Philip's Catholic church, today.
"He was a power of good among his
people. Others of all denominations
who knew him will also greatly re
gret his loss to our community. I
offer my most sincere condolence to
lus bereaved family and people."
A MAN OF NOBLE
CHARACTER AND IDEALS
"It is with sadness that I learned
of the death of our brother pastor
this morning," said Rev. I. D. Al
vord of the Baptist churcfr in regard
to the death of Archdeacon Parshall.
"In the short acquaintance which
I have had with Archdeacon Parshall
I found him to be a man of high
ideals and noble character and it was
a pleasure to know him and converse
with him. I feel that not only the
church to which he ministered in,
our city has met with a great loss
by his being taken from them, but
ilie community at large."
MOTHERS' DAY
TO BE OBSERVEDis
Special Programs in Churches Day
Assumes National
Importance.
Of the days in the year set apart
as memorial days, Mothers' Day. to
morrowhas in a few years become
one of national importance. Found
ed early in 1908, by Miss Anna Jarvis
of Philadelphia, in a local way, the
movement was fostered and extended
by an organization, with Miss Jarvis
at its head, known as the Mothers'
Day International association, until
in 1914, congress proclaimed the day
by resolution.
Governors of states and mayors of
cities indorsed the action of congress
by proclamations, and the day is
now very generally observed by the
American public as one on which
homage is to be paid to mothers liv
ing, and honor accorded to the mem
ories of mothers dead.
While Mothers' day is an American
institution, it is really an extension
or itdaptation of^an old Euglish-cus
tome of visiting one's parents on
Mid-Lent Sunday. Chambers records
this custom as "a practice of going
to see parents, and especially the fe
male one, on the mid-Sunday of Lent,
taking for them some little present,
such-.as a cake or a trinket. A youth
engaged in this amiable act of duty
was said to 'go-a-mothering,' and
thence the day itself came to be call
ed Mothering Sunday.
On Mothers' Day, everyone is ex
pected to wear a flower, preferably a
white carnation, an emblem chosen
by the founder of the Mother Day
International association, and adopt
ed by that organization.
Special programs for "Mothers'
Day" will be given in the Bemidji
churches tomorrow.

PROBING RECORDS
IN KOOCHICHING
Proportion of Bonded Indebtedness is
Less Than Seven Per Cent,
Says Examiner.
COUNTY NOT BANKRUPT
TAXES NOT VERY HIGH
Trouble Arose Over Single Road
Examiner and Attorney in
Border City.
(By Special Correspondent.)
International Falls, Minn., May 13.
Andrew Fritz, public examiner and
Lyndon A. Smith, attorney general,
are here making an examination of
the books of Koochiching county.
The county's proportion of bonded
indebtedness is less than seven per
cent, according to a report made yes
terday. Thus far the officials have
found no cause for complaint in
either expenditures or the manner in
which roads or other improvements
have been made or conducted.
Not Bankrupt.
The county is not bankrupt and
considering what is being done in the
county the taxes are not high. The
a'ssessed valuation of the county is,
according to the last records, $6.-
534,893. The bonded indebtedness
is $1,870,936, about one-fourth of the
assessed valuation. The actual value
of real estate in the county is $17,-
454,187.
The tax rate is 59 mills. Other
counties have a much higher rate.
There are about 789,576 acres of
land on the county tax rolls. In ad
dition there are 22,000 acres of state
land and 250,000 acres of government
lands.
Deserves Credit.
Koochiching county has been mak
ing many improvements and is en
titled to credit for her achievements.
Roads have been constructed and
ditches have been established, be--
sides many other improvements.
The present trouble arose over a
single road. The road is State Rural
Highway No. 24 running west from
International Falls to the Beltrami
county line- Charges have... been
made that the county commissioners
accepted this road when they should
not have done so. The charges are
that the building of the road was an
inferior job.
A public hearing will be conducted
by the attorney general at this place
in order to give the complainants a
chance to substantiate their charges.
County officials state that they wel
come the investigation and a check
irregular will be found and a check
will thus be placed on the rumors
that the county's funds have been
wasted and the county is on the
verge of bankruptcy.
