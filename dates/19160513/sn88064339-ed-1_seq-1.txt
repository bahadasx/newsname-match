I'd like to be rich, and I wonder who

Would leave me too poor for the riches

I'd like to be rich, there Is a pleasure

It's good stuff to have, and It's good
stuff to spend,
It helps you to pay for your milk and

And gives you a chance to be nice to a

I'd like to be rclh, but I'd never be

To pay such a price as some men do

harvested the latter part of May. which

Corn will ordinarily yield from five to

per acre. Sorghum and corn in about
equal parts make good ilagte. The
corn requIres from one hundred and
ten to one hundred and forty days fafter
planting to ripen for stlage, while

ninety days. This should be taken into
