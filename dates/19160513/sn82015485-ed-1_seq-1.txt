"Save your waste paper." It sounds
all rigbt, but it seems that the freight
per. ton to the nearest market. is just
about twice the market price of waste
paper.. Ve must learn how to utilize
other wasted products, such as straw;
grass, etc., and locate the paper mill
near the material. , -

: Almost every day we hear of new
applications of old principles, or new
aud modern uses of well know powers.
One of these latin inventions is.calted
the "aerothriist" and is used to propel
a row boat. It is a propeller which
acts on the air instead of the wateril
a sort of reverse w led mill, as it might
be called.
. "Dainty little dandelion, smiling on
the lawn!" Yes it is a greatsmiier,
awl right, and the more you smite it
the more it smiles, but there is noth
ing: dainty about it unless you can
think of a dish of dandelion "greeos"
as a "dainty." There is nothing frail
or fragile about it either. . Why, a
dandelion has more lives than a cart
load of black cats. Cut off a dande
lion's "crown" just below the surface,
and in a few weeks it comes up again,
smiling has ever, and proceeds to re
crown itself king (or-queen?) of the
lawn. As a multiplier it beats all
onions . m creation. Cut off one
"crown" and three or more will be
right " there for the next coronation,
and every one of the "dainty? yellow
blooms cut oft and left lying in the
sun will mature a hundred seeds,
full-ftedged and1-firing everywhere
within, two days, and all -the anti
aircraft guns in Europe couldn't bring
one of them down until It gets ready
to 'light,'' and" they are not- very
particular as to the place where SKey
comedown either." Anyground seems
to be good' ground . for , these iliers
when they go forth to sow, and,
thousand 'fold wouldn't be an extra
vagant estimate of the crop. They
have no regard for neutrality, inter
national 'law, blockades,, or belliger
ents. Any field becomes a - field of
gold and; then a "downy" bed of
anything but ease for the' fellows who
sweat and swear in. the trenches,
digging out not "digging in'" as
they do in warfare.
o
The decrowning method of fighting
the dandelion may remind you of the
way a woman "punished" a male
which she found, burrowing in her
garden. She buried alive! It seems
that the fiery furnace is about the
only treatment that will feaze the
golden crown. By the way,- should
we speak of the dandelion as of mas
culine or feminine gender? ' By its
fondness for dress and bright colors,
it may be adjudged of feminine gend
er.. On the other hand, the word
signifies "dent (or tooth) of the lion,"
which would indicate the mascuine,
but, alawn pest, the dandelion is
simply "it."
So there, now ! That's some dandy
essay on the dandelion, aint it?

latest European War pictures, show
