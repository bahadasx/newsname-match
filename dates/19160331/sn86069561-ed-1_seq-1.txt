Coming Again
Most of the Clothcraft suits in our store will be bought by men
who wore Clothcraft last winter.
We know these men will ccme back for Clothcraft buyers
are repeaters.
Ask any man who wears Clothcraft we can tell you of lots of
them if he ever before got as much comfort, good style and long
wear for the same cost.
Clothcraft makers have for three generations devoted all their
efforts to improving medium.priced clothes. By scientific study
they have worked out shorter and better ways to perform all the
operations that make a suit, Their success gives you better fabrics,
better linings, superior workmanship in a word, more style, com
fort and value for your money.
Drop in and see Clothcraft Clothes for Spring and Summer.
We know that after one experience your own satisfaction will tell,
you why Clothcraft wearers come again.

The following article which by
chance dropped into our hands,
was written by one of the best
and shrewdest business men of
Eastern Kentucky, and we have
reproduced it with the hope that
our farmers, business and pro
fessional men will read it and
consider what such would mean
to Rockcastle.
The article is as follovs:
Rockcastle county success de
pends on success of Rockcastle
county farmers. The success of
Rockcastle county farmers de
pends on persistent and intensive
application of muscle and brains
to local conditions.
The man who depends on dead,
poor soil can never succeed. Dead
poor soil can be chauged to live,
productive soil by the use of
crushed limestone. phosphorus
and decaying vegetable matter,
with intelligent crop rotation. The
crop rotation must include clover
and cow-peas. Where land is
fresh (new) or has been limed,
clover is much the better; if' old
and unlimed, use cow-peas. Pnos
phorus, when used with good sup
ply of stable manure or green
jlover, crop turned under, should
oe in lorm of raw phosphate rock,
rinely ground. This is much the
cheapest way to secure a supply
jf phosporus; out if in old land,
leficient in humus, use acid phos
phate. Growing cattle, sheep and
chickens will probably prove most
jrofitable in Rockcastle cou nty.
If dogs interfere with sheep, the
farmers should organize a Farm
ers Protective Association, and
join together in killing dogs. It
iosts more to feeda dog than to
leed a sheep. To grow stock suc
cessfully the feed for all the year
round must be grown at home;
pasture in summer and plenty for
ige for winter feed.
Lancaster county, Pennsylva
nia, is the richest farming county
in America. It is signiricantthat
they handle more cattle than any
farming county in America.
Russell H Conwell in bis famous
lecture, "Acres of Diamonds,"
locates the diamods in tho vicin
ity of where we live. If found in
Rockcastle county thev will be
found in stock raising and up-to-late
farming.
Good roads and good schools
ire essential to prosperous and
contented rural communties. Do
our part toward promotiug and
maintaining both. Be a booster
ind not a knocker. Boost for
your own neighborhood, your own
school district and your own
ounty.
Spend your money at home
'hen you can do better, in so do
ng, than sending away from home
for supplies. The big catalogue
houses are run at big expense and
ire not in position to sell except
t GOOD PROFITS. When you
idd postage, express charges,
tc, you seldom, if ever, make a
living. Remember they do noth
ng to help build up your co.mty.
Vhen you send your money to
Chicago you may be helping to
'ceep up streets and schools in
Chicago but you are not helping
vour own county roads and
ichools.

CATARRAHAL DEAFNKSh
CANNOT BE CURED
by local applications, as they can
not reach the diseased portion of
the ear. There is only one way to
cure catrrhal deafness and that is
by a constitutional remedy Ca
tarrhal Deafness is caused by an
inflamed condition of the mucous
lining of the Eustachian tube.
When this tube is inflamed you
have a rumbling sound or imper
fect hearing, and when it is entire
ly closed. Deafness is the result.
Unless the inflamation can be re
duced and this tube restored to its
normal condition, hearing will be
destroyed forever. Many cases of
deafness are caused by oatarrh,
which is an inflamed coudition of
of the mucous surfacesr Hall's
Catarrh Cure acts throug the
blood on the mucous surfaces of
the system
We will give One Hundred Dol

ness that cannot be cured by
Hall's Catarrh Cure. Circulars
