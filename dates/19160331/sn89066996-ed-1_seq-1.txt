Different Methods
Editor Farmington (Times :
A few days ago 'one of the little
pamphlets, addressed "to the Stock
holders of the St. Joseph Lead Com
pany," and containing a brief state
ment of the demands made on the
Doe Ran Lead Co. and the St. Joseph
Lead Co., by Robert Holmes, relative
to 18,679 shares of the capital stock
of the St. Joseph Lead Co., which in
1902, and for some time prior there
to, was owned by the Doe Run Lead
Co. and held by the Treasurer and
.ither officers and directors of the Doe
Run Lead Co. "in trust" for the use
and benefit of said company, came to
my notice, and I was startled and sur
prised by the unearthing of such a
daring and uncanney transaction as
is described in Baid pamphlet and at
tributed to the officers and directors
of said companies.
The facts appear to be about as
follows: That toward the end 01" Oc
tober, 1902, it became known that the
St. Joseph Lead Co. would shortly de
clare a stock dividend of 50 per cent;
lhat as the 18,679 shares could, by
some cute manipulation, be bought by
certain individuals for $373,580 and
that, therefore, as these 18,679 shares
would be increased to 28,018 shares
worth about $560,360, so it would be
possible to reap a profit of $186,780
for the manipulators at the expense,
injury and damage of the Doe Run
Lead Co., or the remaining stockhold
ers thereof; that at the time of this
chicanery, (October, 1902) J. Wyman
Jones, C. B. Parsons, F. E. Camp,
Gust. Setz and D. A. Jones were di
rectors of the Doe Run Lead Co. and
also of the St. Joseph Lead Co., there
fore, had every opportunity of know
ing what was going to be done as to
the management of said companies;
that the sale of the 18,679 shares,
afore mentioned, was made in accor
dance with a preconcerted plan,
through F. E. Camp, Treasurer, of the
Doe Run Lead Co., and transferred
to F. E. Camp, Gust Setz, D. A.
Jones, J. Wyman Jones and others of
the interested few in about equal
blocks; and that, as anticipated, early
in December, 1902, a 50 per cent stock
dividend was declared, thus increas
ing the original 18,679 shares to 28,
018 shares and bringing the new own
ers a net profit of 9,339 shares worth
about $186,780, an increase that real
ly should have gone to the Doe Run
Lead Co., or its stockholders, had the
directors and officers done their duty
and protected the interests of their
company rather than cheat the inno
cent stockholders to enrich their own
pockets.
These unearthings are among the
many that nowadays are coming to
light and much is due the peering and
discerning eye of one Robert Holmes
in uncovering and attempting to right
these wrongs, of years ago, that have
escaped unnoticed by the innocent, un
suspicious stockholder. Although
about 15 years have passed since this
piece of rottenness was perpetrated,
yet it is to bo hoped that it is not too
late to compel restituion and reim
bursement to the injured and damag
ed parties.
Mr. Holmes as a stockholder of the
Doe Run and St. Joseph Lead Com-,
panies has demanded an equitable !
restitution and reimbursement to the
parties thus injured, of which number
ho is one. He made the legal demands
on the Board of Directors of the com
panies on November 23, 1915, de
manding that they take the necessary
legal steps to require the derelicts, or
of
"High Financiering'
in case of their decease then their ex
ecutors or legal representativs, to
make reparation and restitution; but
his dmands were absolutely ignored,
he receiving not even the courtesy of
a reply. In furtherance of his efforts
to bring justice to the defrauded
stockholders of the Doe Run Lead Co.
Mr. Holmes, through his attorneys,
has brought the necessary suit in the
Courts of equity, in the hope of com
pelling equitable restitution and reim
bursement to the persons upon whom
the above fraud was perpetrated. As
a citizen and one who is interested in
seeing the ends of justice attained
and maintained, and every man ren
dered his just due, I, among many
others, hope his efforts will not be in
vain.

For Information
of the Taxpayers
To the Tax-payers of Farmington
Public School District:
The Board of Education of the
Farmington Public Schools states, for
your information, lhat the tax levy
last year for all purposes was $1.30
on the Hundred Dollars assessed val
uation. Of this amount, 86 cents was
for school purposes (teacher and in
cidental) and the remainder was to
i meet the bonded indebtedness. The
I Board pledges you that last' year's
rate will not be increased. But we do
ask the tax-payers, by their vote at
the April election, to increase tho
rate for school purposes from 86
cents to 100 cents. An additional levy
of 30 cents will, with the amount now
on hands to the credit of the Sinking
and Interest funds, meet the bonded
debt for the ensuing year.
Why increase the rate for school
purposes? The answer is that we
will have practically no surplus to
the credit of the Teachers' and Inci
dental funds, and we must have more
money with which to make needed
repairs, paint the buildings and, ow
ing to the crowded condition of some
of the rooms in the grades, we will
necessarily be compelled to employ an
additional teacher to relieve this con
gested condition.
Bear in mind that the total tax
rate will not be increased and no ad
ditional burden will be placed on you.
We simply want to shift the tax rate
to meet conditions for the ensuing
year. Again, by doing this we will
get $200.00 additional from the State.
We trust you will give us a unanimous
support in this important matter.
BOARD OF EDUCATION,

WRECK OF THREE FAST
TRAINS ON N. Y. CENTRAL
Thirty Killed and 40 Injured as Trains
Crash into Each Other
Cleveland, O., March 29. Thirty
persons were killed and 40 injured at
4 a. m. today in the wreck of three fast
passenger trains on the New York
Central lines near Amherst, 45 miles
west of Cleveland. Dense fog ob- J
soured the signal set by the first sec- j
tion of the Eastbound Pittsburg, Bal
timore, Buffalo Limited, causing an
other section of that train to crash in
to it. A short time later, before sig
nal could flag it the fast Twentieth
Century Limited, westbound, crash
ed into the wreckage which had piled
up on the westbound track.
Railroad's Explanation
Train 86 was due in Cleveland at
4:05. The train carried sleeping'
coaches from Chicago to Pittsburg j
nnrl TillflFnln nnH fnnk n alam-ia. ai t
Cleveland for Buffalo. It was split
into two sections today because of
unusually heavy traffic.
The engineer of the first section was
stopped at Amherst by a signal. I
don't know just how, said D. C. Moon,
general manager of the N. Y. Cen
tral. The second section of No. 86
should have stopped because of the
automatic signal or a flagman on the
first section.
"The second section ran into the
end coach of the first section. The
wreckage from both sections went ov
er on the west-bound high speed
The Villa Chase
The expeditionary force of United
States troops under Gen. Pershing
now in Mexico in an effort to capture
the bandit, Villa, is reported to have
an advanced base about 120 miles
south of Casa Grandes. Villa is be
lieved, according to reports that have
reached El Paso, Texas, to be headed
for San Andres, about 25 miles
southwest of Chihuahua, and about
60 miles ahead of his pursuers. A
body of picked cavalrymen has been
concentrated and is in reserve at the
front at some point not given, for
obvious reasons, prepared to make a
dash of indefinite duration as soon as
the bandit chieftain is definitely lo
cated. An El Paso dispatch of March 28th
says:
Dispatches from the front, inter
preted in connection with news
brought by Americans returning
from different points in the interior
of Chihuahua, caused a belief tonight
that Francisco Villa was headed for
San Andres, about 25 miles southwest
of Chihuahua City, a favorite head
quarters of the bandit. He is thought
to be already not less than fifty miles
ahead of his pursuers and possibly
leading the chase at a much greater
distance.
Americans in El Paso familiar with'
the country through which Villa is
fleeing agree that Villa's objective is
the district around Parral and south
from there to Torreon, in which terri
tory numerous Villa bandits under the
leadership of Canuto Reyes are op
erating with considerable success.
Junction Would be Serious.
If Villa is able to effect a junction
with Reyes, the problem of his ex
termination will have become a very
serious one, as he will then be able
to control several thousand soldiers,
who, split into guerilla bands, might
be able to keep up a desultory moun
tain warfare for an unlimited period.
The one hope at present is that the
American cavalrymen may be able to
catch up with Villa before he gets
much farther south. It is admitted
here that the hope is a very slender
one and will be much more accentuat
ed if the American troops are not
given the use of the Mexican railroads
for the bringing of supplies. The sup
plies question overshadows every
thing else now. Army officers here
say that upon its solution depends ev
ery chance of a successful termina
tion to the pursuit of the bandit.
Supply Question More Difficult.
It is not merely the fact that every
mile further that the columns of
Gen. Pershing penetrates into the
country stretches their lines of com
munication to the snapping point, but
also because the punitive expedition
is now entering a very different type
of country from that which it already
track.
"The rear car of the first section
was a coach from Chicago to Pitts
burg. It had 40 passengers. The
next car ahead of the coach was a
club Pullman car. There was no
body in this car but a porter and a
mail clerk. The cars ahead of the
coach and club cars were sleepers.
"The Twentieth Century was de
railed, but nobody on it was injured."
Many Victims Were Asleep
Most of the dead were in the rear
coaches of the first section of the east
bound train No. 86. Some dead were
found in the rear coaches of the sec
ond section of the flyer which buckled
over onto the Twentieth Century's
right of way and was splintered by
that train. The section of the flyer
was going at a high rate of speed
when it struck the first section.
Some of the victims were decapi
tated. Arms, legs and portions of
bodies were scattered through the
wreckage. The body of one fireman,
badly crushed, was found on top of
the boiler of one of the engines. Some
of the members of the three train
crews in the wreck escapeil with
scratches and bruises. C. C. Robin
son, engineer of the Twentieth Cen
tury, crawled uninjured from under
his engine after it had plunged 400
feet along the ties. His fireman and
the conductor also were unhurt.
I has traversed.
In the passes the dim trails of the
' great continental divide over which
. Villa is now fleeing, motor transpor
tation is virtually impossible, accord
ing to the men who know this country.
Nothing but pack mules and horses
can b used and even these must be
loaded lightly.

NEW BUILDINGS
IN CHARLESTON
Charleston, Mo., March 28. The
effect of the abundant crops of last
year on building operations in and
about Charleston, is telling, and more
substantial buildings are in process of
construction, or have been completed,
than ever before marked a like period
in the- city's history.
The list of buildings includes a $35,
000 Y. M. C. A. building, a 17 room
apartment house, two store buildings,
a veterinary hospital, and between 25
and thirty houses. Postmaster E H. I
Smith has also received instructions to '
get estimates on possible sites for a!
new Federal building.
Another new hotel to replace the:
Kenrick Hotel, destroyed by fire, and !
a new bank building are also propose !
Are Farm Lands Assessed
at 35 to 40 Per Cent of Value?
In an article which appeared in The
Times last week contrasting the as
sessment of our lead companies with
farm and other real property, our
figures were based on the popular im
pression that the latter were assessed
generally at from 35 to 40 per cent of
their cash value. This impression is
of such long standing that it has been
relied upon as indisputable, and the
writer from personal experience knows
of at least one piece of real estate
that is assessed in the neighborhood
of that rate. But Assessor Wells
calls our attention to the fact that
the average assessment in this couny
is from 15 to 25 per cent, so the logi
cal conclusion reached in the article
referred to, that the lead companies
paid only one-fourth to one-half as
much tax in proportion as farm lands
do, is off. If the premise is wrong
the conclusion naturally is. Mr. Wells
contends that there is little if any
inequality in the assessment of the
lead companies' lands and farm lands.
The efforts of the taxpayers of St.
Louis, who claim to be assessed at
this high assessment are made to pay
70 per cent, and who by reason of
Farmington Furnishing Wholesalers
The European war has almost de
pleted the country of certain lines of
drugs and the prices have correspond
ingly gone up. The wholesale houses
in the larger cities are running short
and are not able to supply the de
mands. They are making requisi
tions upon the country drug stores
for all of certain scarce drugs that j
the latter will dispose of.
E. M. Laakman of this place, who;
always keeps a good supply of every
thing in the drug line, has within the
past few weeks been making liberal
sales to St. Louis and Louisville, Ky.,
wholesale drug houses of some of
these articles, principally asperine,
opium and ichthyol, the latter of which
Teachers Have
Enjoyable Time
A number of the Farmington teach
ers enjoyed the hospitality of the
Bonne Tone teachers in a social meet
ing in Bonne Terre on Saturday, the
25th. A large number of teachers
from other parts of the country were
in attendance and a most enjoyable
day was spent.
In the forenoon a very pleasing
literary and musical program was
rendered in which most of the musical
numbers were presented by the pu
pils of the primary rooms of the
Bonne Terre schools.
The principal feature of the after
noon program was a stirring address
by Professor Benson of the Cape Gi
rardeau Normal, on "The Child in the
Making." The Professor injected an
abundance of enthusiasm into his ad
dress, and succeeded in entertaining
his audience delightfully. He left the
impression on some, however, that his
address was one prepared tq sell and
deliver on a chautauqua platform
rather than to serve as a safe guide
for teachers struggling for rational
truth to apply to their daily work.
At the noon hour a most delicious
lunch was served in the High School
building by the local teachers, and a
delightful social hour was enjoyed by
all present.
A motion was unanimously passed
by the visitors extending thanks to
tho Bonne Terre teachers for the hos
pitality extended, to the pupils for
furnished entertainment, and to Prof.
Benson for his interesting address.
All the teachers present express
themselves as delightfully entertained
and much benefited by the opportuni
ties of the day. May the future pro
vide many such excellent meetings
for the teachers of the county.
Among the Farmington teachers :
present were Supt. Johns, Mrs. Anna
Lloyd, Mrs. Jennie Gruner, Mrs. Anna
Murrill, Mr. Abernathy, Misses Ra
ble, Roberta Tetley, Ruth Swink, Le
anna Cole, Mary Taylor and Bertha
Spaugh.
It is said that "variety is tho spice
of life."' Such spice was added to
weather conditions Monday, when J
there was a light snowfall, which

a disproportionate share of the State
tax, to have the Statu Board of Equal
ization remedy this inequality in some
way, has made considerable stir; and
according to a Jefferson City corres
pondent of the St. Louis Times of the
29th, the State Board has been re
viewing the valuations placed upon
farm lands by the assessors of the
State. According to the figures given
out, the total valuation placed upon
farm lands by the local assessors for
the year's taxes aggr egate $469,133,
867. Then the total valuation of all
farm property in Missouri, as given in
the United States census of 1910, is
$2,062,917,488. If these figures are
correct, and we suppose that they are
approximately, and are assessed in
the aggregate at $469,133,867, then
farm property as a whole is assessed
at only about 20 per cent instead of
35 and 40 per cent, according to the
proverbial idea.
And this causes us to remark again,
no wonder St. Louis and the larger
cities are complaining about paying
such a large disproportionate share
of the State tax. The inequality
ought to be remedied.
is practically off the market.
Ichthyol is an Austrian oil used for
local applications and the treatment of
membranes; it is also in certain cases
taken internally. Asperine is one of
the coal tar drugs mostly used for
headache powders and for nervous
troubles, and opium is used in many
concoctions as well as being greatly
abused and misused, the opium habit
formed by some being even a worse
infliction and harder to overcome than
the whiskey habit.
Naturally the retailers in these sales
are getting the advantage of the ad
vanced prices of such drugs, else they
would not be induced to dispose of
them to the wholesalers.

PUBLIC LIBRARY NEWS
The technical work at the Public
Library is progressing rapidly. The
books have been classified, catalogued
and numbered, and the pockets and
cards are now being placed in each
volume. When this work is com
pleted the books will be ready for dis
tribution. The Juvenile Department has some
splendid books that every child will
enjoy, but here especially, there is
need of many more volumes, if the
library is to fulfill its mission among
the young people of the town.
Books will be received in Room 10
of the High School building on Tues
days and Saturdays, between 3 and 5
o'clock. Give a book to the Library,
