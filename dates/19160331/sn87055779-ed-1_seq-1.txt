ITTICK FREED
Judge Warner Rules Evidence
of State Authorities is
Insufficient.
Pert W. Cohen, inspector for the
state pure food and drug department
was literally charged with being a
party to a plot to injure certain
druggists in South Hend by Atty.
Dan Pyle in his closing argument
Fridu morning in city court in the
case of the state against Martin K.
Wettick. owner of the Cut Kate drim
store on V.. Jefferson blvd., recused
of misbranding drugs.
Judge Warner found Wettick not
guilty and ordered him dismissed. In
handing down his decision he stated
that insufficient evidence had been in
troduced to show that there was any
criminal intent or knowledge. He
pointed out that evidence was
hrought forth hy the defense show
ing that Wettick had bought his
goods from reputable wholesale
houses and had paid a reasonable
price for the same. No evidence was
introduced hy the state to show that
Wettick purchased asperin from
other than reputable sources.
"I don't think this charge was
hrought in good ftith." aisertec:
Atty. Pyle, pointing out that such
prosecution would not tend to help
the public and that, it appeared to
hav been instigated either for per
sonal or for other reasons.
Wettick was charged with selling
spurious asperin tablets. After

He said a youny lady waited on him
and he produced the box which she
said contained the tablets. In his
direct testimony he stated that the
box bore the name, of the Wettick
store and also serial numbers which
he placed upon it for the accommo
dation of the drug department. That
he was mistaken about this was re
vealed in cross- examination when it
was hovn that the box contained no
label whatsoever. Cohen stated
that he bought asperin tablets at the

Internatlon? 1 News Service:
CLEVKIjAND. (.. March 31. At
the joint federal-state probe into the
cause of Wednesday's New York
Central wreck at Amherst, which
started here today and was presided
over by Chief H. W. Pelnap of the
Interstate commerce commission's
division of safety, testimony of wit
nesses brought the fact that both
sections of train No. S6, eastbound,
were exceeding' their regular run
ning time although fox conditions
made this proceeding hazardous.
F. C. Hausch, train dispatcher,
who was on duty at the time of the
disaster, was the first witness. He
testified that, although a hulletin
had heen posted stating that first 8 6
would run 15 minutes late, this train
left Toledo eight minutes late and
made up seven minutes between To
ledo and Vermilion, a distance of 72
miles. The second section of train
S6 left Toledo at 1:56 a. m., 21 min
utes late, and made up 14 minutes
during the run to Vermilion.
Asked if he had ever known auto
matic signals to fail, Bausch testi- j
fied that he had. Usually this hap- :
pens in extremely cold weather, he j
said. Pau:h also testified that there:
had been signal trouble at Amherst j
four weekn a?o. The operator there
had been ordered to hold westbound
ttain No. 25, hut his signal instead
of showing red, showed "clear."
Iteixirts Wrec k.
Bausch said that Operator Ernst
at Amherst had reported the passing
of trains promptly on the night of
the wreck, and that he had called
Ernst at 3:15 a. m.. and Ernst had
told him that first S t was stopping,
hut gave no reason. Bausch said
Ernst reported the wreck to him
four minutes after it occurred.
Operator Ernst took the stand
next. He stated that he had work
ed at Amherst tower five night.s pre
vious to the accident. He had work
ed as an operator since July 20,
1901. He said he had worked for
the Denver and liio Grande and the
Union Pacific.
Ernst argues that if the tower or
"home" signal showed red at the ap
proach of first SG the system was out
of order. Engineer Eeonard of the
first flection claims to have stopped
v.hen the home signal showed reel.
If the automatic signals were work
ing properly the block signal should
have shown red and stopped the sec
ond section. Engineer Hess declares
that all signals showed, clear to him.
hut after the collision he went back
and found the block red, therefore
he blame. defective apparatus.
Blames Engineer lies.
W. H. Elliott, signal engineer of
the New York Central lines east of
Buffalo, who came to Cleveland to
assist in the investigation, was pos
itive loaay mat engineer Hess wa: '
Hie one man on whom the blame of
the disaster must rest. His explana
tion follow?:
"By Hess' own statement he went
hack immediately following th- ac
cident to see if the block signal was
showing against him. It was. he
says. If that is tru if the light
was showirg against Hesw just after
the aeciier.t we know that it was
showing against him just before.
"If Hess says he failed to see the
lights, that is no excuse, our ruls
are clear on that point. When an
engineer loses himpelf he must stop
and get his bearings. Careful en

Internat ionn I New Servb-e:
EE BASO, Texas. March 31. -Francisco
Villa, in person, led thn
Kind of troops that massacred the
172 Carranzista soldiers forming the
garrison at Guerrero and with his
own hands killed morv than a dozen,
of the victims, according to reports
reaching the border today. Theso
advices asserted that VI 11 1st a- wer
overrunning the entire Guerrero dis
trict, robbing, burning and killing.
They reiterated rumors that Her
man BlankerWrg. a German, and
two other foreicne-rs had been as
sassinated at Minaca. The advices
failed to identify the other victim
at Minaca, hut three Americans, A. J.
Ixcke. B. Heimple and Benjamin
Snell, were In or near that town last.
Monday, according to friends In El
Paso.
From Guerrero Villa is said to
have marched northward and th
latest information received at Car
ranza headquarters in Juatez located
hini at Geronimo ranch. American
officers at Fort Blis- hope that this
information is correct, declaring that
if so Villa woulc! he surrounded by
the Mexican and United State
j forces cooperating in the hunt for
the bandit.
Massacre Not PlaniUNl.
! A el snatch received bv Gen. Ga-
i viera. the 'arranza c uumamler at
Juarez, indicated that Villa had not
planned to massacre all the govern
ment soldiers at Guerrero, hut found
himself hard presse-d by the pursu
ing columns and ordered the death
of 60 men whom he was taking away
as prisoners. Theft men, it is said,
wete hrutally tortured befote they
were shot down. Villa, angered by
what ho believed inexcusable slow
ness on the part of the execution
F'juad is rejHjrted to have himself
shot all the men in one batch.
The rumor that Villa was wounded
in the attack on Guerrero is not
credited by Gen. Gaviera owing to
the reports that the bandit leader
took a prominent part in the massa
cre that followed.
Gen. Gaviera was still awaiting to
day an order from the Garrnnza gov
ernment to permit the passage of
supplies for American troops ovr
the Mexico-Northwestern railway.
The only recent information h h.w
received on this subject is the si
report of the Washington announce
ment that Gen. Garranza had grant
eel the request, of the American gov
ernment. His firs' order not to
permit the ns of Mexican railways
has not yet Ier-n rescinded.
Many car's of supplies are await
ing on the American s!de of th" in
ternational railwav bridge. Investi-
i nation at Juarez shows that th b
jomotives necessary for taking .nil t
; the cars into M-ico are no vc
i avai la ble.
