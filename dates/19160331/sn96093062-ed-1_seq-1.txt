Judge requested the instruction "of
delegates tor Beu Lafayette for na
tional committeeman. Nono of the
Durant preclnces gave such Instruc
tions to their delegates, as it was
feared such Instruction might pre
cipitate a fight in tho county conven
tion, as there is much sentiment here
favoring the selection of Tom Wade
of Marlow. Governor Williams, who
is a resident of the Second Ward in
this city, and a delegate to the coun
ty convention, is said to favor the
selection of Mr. Wade, although this
is not known for a certainty.

" 'During the pnst week I have
traveled the route of the Jefforson
Highway from Atoka to Durant, and
find the road bed in good condition
for most of the distance,' said Mr.
Nesbitt today. 'Bryan already has a
well graded road from north to south
which the county commissioners pro
pose to put in the best of shape with
out delay by convict labor which has
already been arranged for. Atoka
County, from tho Bryan County line
to Caney, has a fine rock road in the
abandoned Jvaty Highway which can
be made a model thoroughfare with
a slight outlay of money. North of
Caney the Boggy Creek bottom must
be crossed and it; is in this swampy
district that I find the greatest diffi
culty will bo encountered.

ford will meet me at Atoka Monday,
when wo will establish the line north
to Pittsburg County and discuss tho
engineering problems that muBt be

Atoka County without delay and we
expect to have the Jefferson High

What are believed to be well
founded rumors, have it that tho Re
