and lack of uniformity in tlie mi
for cement of traffic regulations by
the police generally
Evidence of specific eases where the
sporadic enforcement of regulations !
works hardships on Washingtonians j
who drive motor cars for pleasure or
in their daily business, and of specific ;
cases where there is discrimination!
against owners, while taxi cabs, motor J
trucks, delivery wagons and motor cycles
appear to escape enforcement of j
the law, soon are to be laid before the j
District Commissioners.
It became known today that a cumber
of Washingtonians, all owners and
drivers of cars, have been gathering i
evidence for some time upon which to!
appeal to the Commissioners for a fair .
and uniform enforcement of the regulations.
It is said that the prominence j
some of the men who have joined |
Whe movement will be a surprise to the
Commissioners themselves when they
are disclosed.
These men. it was explained today by
one of the leaders, ask no favors, seek
no immunit<es. They are willing ami
intend to conform with all the police
regulations, but they will insist that
all motor drivers shall do so and that
they shall not suffer by discrimination.
The general question of whether the
twelve-mile speed limit is too low will
be left for the future. For the present
the movement is only to show that
drivers of so-called pleasure cars are
being forced to bear the brunt of occasional
enforcement of the regulations,
while the most persistent offenders
seldom feel its effects.
No Special Privileges Asked.
When the movement has developed
to a point where the evidence which
is being carefully gathered is complete,
a public meeting will be announced, to
which all motorists will he invited, and
the plan of action will be more fully
M disclosed.
There is no disposition in tne movement
to contend that ambulances, rue
apparatus or other public-service vehicles
on emergency missions should be
restricted to ordinary limits. The movement
intends to studiously avoid anything
that might be construed as asking
for special privilege or to be regarded
as a favored class. All the
movers intend to ask is that the regulations
shall be applied alike to all.
In every respect, it is the intention to
co-operate with the police department
in enforcing the present laws. Investigators
have found that in several western
cities where like movements have
been carried to success motor car owners
have put their cars at the disposition
of the police on specific occasions.
Driven by their owners and loaded with
plain-clothes men. the most flagrant offenders
have quickly been rounded up
bv the these motor patrols.
Another <our:e which worker] out
successfully was the mounting of pri\ate
investigators on motor cycles, who
gathered specific evidence, arid often
made affidavits of violations which were
unchecked liy the police, although committed
in full view of police ofTi?-?-rs.
The reports of these investigators,
which in every case were backed up
by statements ??f credible witnesses,
were largely Instrumental In checking
other abuses in connection with the administration
of the motor vehicle laws. ;
Parking Regulation Ignored.
At the present stage those who are
in charge of the preliminary movement
are reluctant to publish the results,
preferring to withhold them until they
are In more complete form and have
been presented to the District Commissioners
with an opportunity for action.
It is known, however, that one of
the instances of discrimination toward
which the investigators have turned
the parking regulation on Pennsylvania
avenue. Orders went out to arrest
all drivers parking cars at the
curbs instead of in the middle of the
street. Man y owners were arrested
and forfeited collateral which aggregated
a considerable sum. A day later
the police stopped making arrests, explaining
they had been ordered to do
so. Citizens who were penalized now
enjoy the chagrin of seeing more fortunate
ones immune from arrest for
the very offense for which they practically
were fined sums ranging from
%'l to S5.
Along 15th street m particular evidence
has been gathered to show that the
regulation which gives to a vehicle moving
north and south the right of way
motor-driven delivery wagons cross the
busy street from east and west at illegal
rates of speed, apparently with immunity
and with great danger to life.
Instances have been gathered to show
that occasional drivers have been penalized
for crossing bridges at forbidden
speed, and that within the same hour
horse-drawn wagons, trolley cars and
many motor vehicles have violated the
same regulation repeatedly with impunity.
(Signals Are Disregarded.
Cases have been recorded In which
motor drivers, disregarding signals at
crossings have proceeded in the face
traffic without more than a whistle or
protest from the crossing policeman
Evidence is being gathered to show
that a very large proportion of the
motor vehicles on the streets of Wash
ingtori violate the speed laws at crossings.
on corners, around circles and
generally, and that the occasional arrest
of an offender, who seldom is a
flagrant one. constitutes an illegal dis#ri

Lawyers among those who are forwarding
the movement have counseled
a full discussion of the facts, supported
by legal evidence, with the Commissioners.
believing that a disclosure of
the actual conditions will lead to a
remedy, but they say there is no doubt
that. If necessary a uniform and nondiscriminatory
enforcement of law can

According to the story told department
agents by H??rst \on der Goltz.
the alleged Herman spy brought to New
York by Scotland Yard detectives last
Tuesday, the plan to blow up the Wetland
canal was known to Capt. von

who furnished money for the
work.
Von Papen Indorsed Plan.
Von der Goltz was quoted as saying
tha? von I'apen had indorsed the Wellarid
canal proposal after it had been
de< led that it would be impossible to (
lead a large armed expedition Into fan- j

States in July. 1S11 4, from Mexico, where
he had been on (Jen. Villa's staff, and
reported to von I'apen. The plan to
j invade Canada, he told department
agents, had been his. not von Paperi's.
After he had obtained von Papen's indorsement,
von der Goltz said, he went
to Baltimore to induce Germans of the.
crews of German merchant vessels tied
up there to join him. He also trieil j

plan Was Abandoned.
| After a time, von der Goltz said, the
plan was abandoned. The intended
point of invasion, officials said, was
"west of the Rr^at lakes." The force
which von der Goltz wanted to raise
for the expedition was to be sufficiently
large to engage the attention of the
troops Canada was training to send to
Europe.
When the plan was abandoned, von
der Goltz said, he proposed blowing up
the Welland canal. Tauscher was to :
furnish the dynamite, and von der Goltz I
was to take four men with him to do I
j the work. j

First Arrest a Month Ago.
The first arrest was made in New
York nearly a month ago. where the ;
prisoner, a German named Busse, is
i now held secretly by department
! agents. The second arrest was made
I in K1 l'a?io about two weeks ago. and
: the prisoner, who spoke broken Eng'
lisn, said his name was it. Tucker.
He was selling small metal replicas of ;
{the German cruiser Emderi. He wax :
i taken to New York/ locked up at Ellis
, Island, where he now is confined, and
! later told the department's agents his true
name. He admitted that he had been one
of Von der Goltz s companions in the
project to destroy the Welland canal.
Busse is held under a charge of conspiracy.
officials said, and Tucker is held
as a material witness. A charge may be
made against him later.
The third of Von der Goltz s alleged accomplices
is an Italian, officials said, who
has t?e?-n under surveilance some time in
New England, and can be arrested a; any ;
Jtime. The tourth and last is a German, i
I Alfred A. Fritzen, who was mentioned
[in the complaint against. Tauscher. Frit!
zen's whereabouts are believed to be
known and his arrest is expected.
Fritzen. Kusse and von <ler Goltz
all were in the pay of von Papen. department
agents said. Their names appear
on the stubs of von Papen's check
books seized by the British while Capt.
von Papen was on his way home, and
von der Goltz has told department
agents that von Papen sent them other
sums of money which do not appear
on the stubs. Some of this money was
sent, von der Go'tz said, while the men
were waiting their chance to get across
the international line arid dynamite the
canal.
NEW YORK. March 31.?Capt. Hans
Tauscher, said to be an officer in the
German navy, and reported to be the
head of the Tauscher Arms Company of

1
Representative Tinkham Also Ar-'
gues to Place District Employes |

Hearings before the committee on
civil service reform and before the
House District committee today marked
the opening of a campaign by Representative
Tinkham of Massachusetts to ]
place postmasters of the first three
classes in the civil service, as well as
to place the employes^ of the District
government in the same class. Backed ,
by the National Civil Service Reform I
League. Representati ve Tinkham
argued th?* merits of both his bills, introduced
to bring about the two re- ,
forms mentioned. Tie appeared be- |
fore the civil service committee in the ]
morning, while the District commit- <
tee hearing on the Tinkham bill to
place the District government in the ! |
civil service began late this afternoon.
The league officers made arguments in 1
favor of both bills.
Representative Tinkham himself pre- i
sented lengthy arguments this morning
showing why the Post Office De- .
partment, the biggest one of all the '
"people's enterprises," should clear its
skirts of the spoils' system.
Used to Pay Political Debts. i
He gave figures showing that there 1
are more than 9,000 postmasters ap- !
pointed through political influence, !
their salaries totaling approximately '
$16,000,000; and also pointed out that '
these men are executive officers and
do not have a hand in controlling ad- '
ministration policies. 1
"There Is no sound or defensible Is
reason why these positions should be |
filled by political hirelings to pay
political debts." he said. "Today this '
greatest of the departments is de- 1
moralized because of the irregular j
system of appointments of the first, t
second and third class postmasters;
these most important positions being
filled by political favorites, who are i
placed in charge of each set of com- i
petitive civil service employes in the
9,121 principal post offices." i

Hospital recovering from the effects

Two Counts in Indictment.
The indictment contains two counts, one
that Waite administered arsenic to his
rather-in-Iaw March 12, "intending willfully
to kill and murder" him ; the second
that the same day he administered to
Peck "a certain deadly poison to the said
Srrand Jury unknown."
Walte's indictment is the result of
ten days' investigation of the case by
District Attorney Swann and. his representatives
here and in Grand Rapids
where Peck's body was sent for burial
ifter his death at his son-in-law's home

Rapids by Percy Peck, the drug manufacturer's
son. after his suspicions as

that he administered the

lis wife, whose body was cremated. The
dentist's wife became the heir in part
to the drug manufacturer's fortune, the
possession of which is alleged to have
been Waite's motive for the crime.
Men from the district attorney's office
were supposed to be digging for
buried treasure today somewhere in the
sands at the end of Long Island, the
$9,000 in bills which Eugene Oliver
Kane, the man who embalmed the body
of John E. Peck, said last night he received

Kane Under Surveillance.
District Attorney Swann was waiting
to hear from them today, meanwhile
keeping Kane under surveillance. Kane
says he did not intend to "wear as
VVaite desired him to, and that he did
not put arsenic in the fluid. It was
expected that he would be called as a
witness before the gr.-nd jury to testify
as to efforts made by the young
dentist to cover his tracks.
Kane was accompanied to the office
of the district attorney by his counsel,
and, although an order for his arrest
had been issued, he was allowed to remain
at liberty in the custody of his
attorney.
Kane said he was sent to Waite by
John S. Potter, the undertaker who had
charge of Peck's funeral, and who told
him Waite wanted to ask him about
the embalming fluid. At Waite's solicitation
he met the dentist in a garage,
where, he said. Waite asked him if he
could put arsenic in a sample of embalming
fluid for the district attorney.
Kane replied it could be done, but that
it was against the law. Waite then
offered him a check for ?0.4OO, which
he said lie did not want, but he did
not return it. Waite, he said, promised
to make him ?-"comfortable for

placed a large roll of bille, which
Waite told Mr. Swann contained $9,000,
into Kane's hands, saying:
"Now, for God's sake get that stuff
in the sample and get it down to the
district attorney's office."
Kane told Mr. Swann he kept the
money. "I was too scared to know
where I was," he said Then he went
home without counting the money,
which was in bills of large denomination,
and hid it in his bureau.
"I was so nervous I shook like a
leaf," he told the district attorney.
The presence of the money in the
house made him so restless, he said,
that he took it to Long Island Thursday
and hid it there. Kane had not
spent any of it, he said.
Undertaker Potter was taken to Mr.
Swann's office while Kane was being
examined and was again questioned.
Mrs. Margaret Weaver Horton, the
singer who was a close friend of
Waite, did not see the young dentist at
Beilevue Hospital today. Although the
district attorney was willing to give
his permission, Waite's counsel asked
her to postpone her visit.
Counsel for Waite has announced he
has engaged the services of Dr. Morris
J. Karpas, formerly head of the Manhattan
Hospital and a widely known
alienist, in behalf of his client.

Petrograd Reports Repulse of Teutonic
Attacks at Several Points
on Battlefront.
PETROGRAD. .March 31.?Since the
first blows struck by the Russians along
the northern sector in the most recent offensive,
the Russian situation has con.
tinually improved and the heights which
they now command along the left bank
of the Dvina and their successful operations
in the Riga district are considered
a solid foundation for a further advance
as soon as the spring thaw is over and the
ground becomes firm.
The Russian offensive maneuvers along
the Dvinsk-Riga front already have reni
dered the carefully constructed positions
' of Field Marshal von Hindenburg less secure
and will, it is thought here, determine
the course of the coming spring
campaign.
General Engagement.
The fighting now has developed from
isolated encounters along a ten-mile
front to a general engagement extending
more than thirty-five miles along
the lines. German troops that were
being rushed to this front, instead of
taking- part in an advance believed to
have been intended by the Germans, are
occupied in defending their positions
of last fall, arid it appears to observers
here that field Marshal von Hindenburg's
spring campaign will be defensive
rather than the offensive one that
was expected.
Russian Communication.
The following Russian official communication
was issued last night:
"In the Riga region the German artillery
fired salves at the Ikskull
bridgehead. In the Jacobstadt sector,
the enemy having violently bombarded
the environs of the village of Epukn.
southeast of Augustinhof, opened an
attack which was repulsed by our fire.
"Enemy detachments advancing in
the region of the River Oldevnitz were
repulsed beyond the river. There has
been artillery and rifle firing in the
Dvinsk region. An enemy attack south
of the village of Vidzy was repulsed
by our fire.
Enemy Is Dispersed.
"West of I.ake Narocz. the enemy
concentrated in intrenchments south of

"South of the Pripet and in Galicia
the fighting is confined to reciprocal
firing- and skirmishes by scouts. Our
riflemen brought down an enemy aeroplane
in the Trembowla district. The
two airmen, a captain and a lieutenant,
were taken prisoner.
"On the whole front th?j thaw is

Gen. Funston Is Only Waiting
for Word From Carranza.
NO OBSTACLE RAISED YET,
WAR DEPARTMENT SAYS
Military Situations Along Border
Are Satisfactory. Is Word Received
by Gen. Scott.
The State Department, pot an unofficial
and unconfirmed report that the
Villa fight at Guerrero, Mex., in which the
bandit chieftain is reported to have killed
172 men of a Carranza garrison, had to
do with a revolt in the garrison in which
some 300 men were involved. Some of
them are reported to have joined Villa.
Gen. ScotT, chief of staff, said official
dispatches from Maj. Gen. Funston indicated
supplies would begin to move into
Mexico by railroad today, or as soon as
Gen. Gavira, commanding the de facto
government troops at Juarez, had received
instructions from Gen. Carranza.
Gen. Scott added no obstacle had been
raised by Carranza officials against the
use of the roads and neither was there
any urgent necessity for immediate transportation
of supplies by railroads.

The military situation both along the
border and in the territory where the
American columns are operating was
described by Gen. Funston as satisfactory
in a personal letter to Gen. Scott.
Published reports that Gen. Funston
was dissatisfied with the slow-moving
machinery of the War and State departments.
Gen. Sebtt said, were clearly
disproved by Gen. Funston's letter.
"The official dispatches show that the
American troops have encountered no
other difficulty than that involved by
any campaign of this kind." said Gen.
Scott. State Department agents at El
Paso were reported in conference with
Gen. Gavira and Consul Garcia to
agree upon beginning the railway
movement.
Tampico and Vera Cruz Quiet.
Navy Department dispatches today
reported Tampico. Vera Cruz and
Guaymas quiet. The gunboat Wheeling.
patrolling the southern coast, has
left El Carmen. Campeche. .for Puerto
Mexico.
State Department officials said they
had unofficial and unconfirmed information
that supplies had already been
sent to Brig. Gen. Pershing over the
Mexican Northwestern railway, but
the source of the information was not
disclosed.
Secretary Bak^r has authorized

realized that army officers on the border
may be restive over the delay in
diplomatic negotiations, it was declared
that no friction has resulted.
May Accept Aeroplane Offers.
Mr. Baker indicated he might accept
private offers of aeroplanes to the government
from the Aero Club of America
and other civilian aviators. The Aero
| Club s offer to sell two machines at the
nominal price of $1 each, while its patriotism
is appreciated, will not be accepted.
The offer had not reached Mr.
Bake| officially, but he said any private
machrne accepted would be required
to meet the army's efficiency standards
and would be paid for at their actual
