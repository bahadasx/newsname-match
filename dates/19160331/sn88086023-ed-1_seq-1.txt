SCHOOL BOARD MAY NOT
ALLOW CHAN6E IN HOURS
SIM DENTS DISAPPOINTED: MAT
TEH WILL HE CONSIDERED
RY HOARD,
v.sUrdny afternoon during the sec
ond period at the high school. Prof.
Ommbee sent a messenger around to
all the rooms In the building with n
telegram which read like 'this.
"School will take up at the regular
time, 8:10." At this Instant several
moans passed from the students
throughout the rooms, for no other
reason than that In the morning as
sembly Prof. Gambee announced that
on Friday morning the change of pe
riods would take place which had
passed the vote of the students, but
the telegram came from the school
hoard that they would not permit the
change until they held another meet
ing. Now the students are disappoint
ed because of the delay in making the
change and perhaps they will not gel j
It at all
In a recent vote taken as to wheth
er the change should be made, It
showed that fully 85 per cent of tha
students favored the eight continuous
sessions. This plan the board reject
ed. Again only nine students or
about three per cent voted to have
the hours remain as they now stand,
or in other word about 97 per cent
voted to have six periods In the morn
ing and two In the afternoon. It has
been arranged so that the nine stu
dents who voted against the change
and who had good reason for doing
so enn take their work without ant
extra trouble. All the teacher are
very enthusiastic over the change and
would like to see It take place.
Library is Nearing Completion
Will be Beautiful Structure
Pendleton and Umatilla county will
soon have one of the most beautiful,
one of the best arranged and on ot
the most urtistlc library buildings In
the northwest. The structure, which
Is now nearing completion on the
commanding site just north of the
Main street bridge, will be a triumph
of library architecture and Is destined
to become one of the chief prides of
the townsman.
A trip of Inspection through the
building and careful notation of plans
worked out in detail to combine the
maximum of utility with the maximum
of artistic effect, cannot but convince
one, even at this stage in the con
struction, that the completed building
will Justify In full the long effort of
the library board and the expendi
tures made by the city and county.
The building Is now in Its final
stages of construction. The exterior:
has been almost finished and the plas-.
terers are now at work on the Inter-
lor. It will not be long before the'
contractors are putting on the finish
ing touches. The building will be
ready for occupancy before the end
of spring but the library will prob- j
ably not be moved in until sometime,
during the summer owing to the de
lay in the purchase of furnishings.
The wulls of the building are con
structed of hollow tile and the finish
of the exterior Is a pebble dash. The
i oof is of Spanish tile of three slightly
different shades of green so that It!
will present a mottled appearance, j
Three coats of plaster, the middle a
scratch coat, are being put on and,
when completed, the building will be
as fire-proof as It is possible to make
a building.
The library will have a full capac
ity of about 05.000 volumes though a!
present there are only about a fourth

on the main floor there will be a
reading room for adults, a reading
loom for children, and a stack room,
all commodious. The arrangement is
such that the librarian at the loan
desk will have a view of all three
rooms without moving. The book
stack will be radial so that she may
look down each one.
In addition to this floor there will
be cloak rooms for men and women,
a committee room In which any com
mittee of any organisation In the city
may meet, a librarian's office and

will command a beautiful view up the.

adults and the committee room. In
fact the building has been carefully
planned to take full advantage 'of the
beautiful view afforded by the loca
tion. In the basement there will be an
auditorium for the use of civic organ
izations without charge; a room for
club meetings with a small adjoining
kitchen equipped with electric cook
ing appliances, a packing room for
the distribution of books over 'the
