Senators Propose Probe of ,So-

spiracy
Washington, March 30.—A final re
view of the administration's prepar­
edness plans for the navy was given
the house naval committee today by
Secretary Daniels, who will be the
last witness heard before the commit­
tee begins framing its bill.
The Secreatry added in several res­
pects to the program he had mapped
oiit in estimates previously submit­
ted to the committee. He urged the
establishment of a government plant
to manufacture navy projectiles, rais­
ed the estimates for the proposed re­
search laboratory from $1,000,000 to
$1,500,000 asked for about 1.1,000 ad­
ditional men instead of 10,000, and
proposed that civilian educators be
placed at the head of the non-mili­
tary department of the Naval Acade­
my to release line officers for active
service.
Millions for Air Craft.
Requesting that, all provisions for
air service be stricken out of the
live-year building program Mr. Unii
iels urged an appropriation of $2,000.
1)00 for air craft this year, lie ex
plained that there was no way of
determining what ••xpendlyir? woti.d
be necessary in I tie future'.

ministration of the Depari.rneni tore

Reserve Force.
An outline of the Neparftnent's
plans for building up .iji fileyuaU!
reserve lorcff or-the 'navy' was pre­
sented by the Secretary. It provides
for live? classes of reserves'. The first
the •fleet." reserve the recond, the
naval reserve third, the naval auxil­
iary reserve the fourth, the naval
coast defense reserve the fifth, the
volunteer naval reserve.
Secretary Daniels urged the com­
mittee to report favorably the armor
plate factory bill, which recently
passed the senate, and which will be
taken up next Tuesday.
Urges Projectile Plant
A projectile plant, Mr. Daniels J(
clared, was vitally important to the
navy, lie added that a government
plant would make it possible to guard
against navy Inventions getting nto
the hands of possible enemy powers,
as was now almost certain to be the
case.
A determined fight was begun in
the senate today by Senator Under­
wood of Alabama, to incorporate in
the army reorganization bill a pro­
vision looking to the establishment of
a plant to make nitrogen from the air
to make explosives. Efforts to in
corporote such legislation in the
house were defeated.
Attacks Powder Co.
'Senator Underwood declared the
program would not be completed
without this provision. He attacked
the Ou Pont Powder company and its
agents, charging them with using
powerful influences to defeat such leg­
islation on account of the desire to
control all the powder business in
the United States and to prevent the
government from entering the field.
In this connection he declared that
Hudson Maxim, a member of the na­
vy civilian board, was a consulting
engineer of the Du Pont company,
and as such had characterized con­
gressmen who fought for a govern­
ment nitrate plant, as a "pork barrel
proposition."
50-Year Leases.
Early in the day, Senator Salisbury,
of Delaware, introduced a bill pre­
pared by counsel of the Du Pont com­
pany, providing for 50-year water
power site leases to corporations,
which would enable them to erect a
hydro-electric plant for production of
nitrate from the air, and supply the
government at a price to be. fixed by
the Secretary of War. Senator Un­
derwood referred to this measure in

"Jim" Manahan Starts Rough
House and Is Called By
Judge
WANT TO AMEND
THEIR COMPLAINT
Minot, March IK).—It is anticipated
that an early motion will be made to
dismiss the $. 0 i,000 damage suit
brought by Grant Youmaus of this
city against the state banking board
and local bankers charged with rob­
bing him of the assets and stock of
the Trust and Savings bank closed
more than ?. year ago ny the state
banking department on the grounds
of insolvency.
Sensations Net Pertinen-.
Most of the three days the case has
been in progress has been devoted to
legal sparring. Mr. Youman's has
been on the stand, but as yet has
been unable to get his story of "Legal­
ized Hank Robbing" before the far­
mers' jury. The battery of lawyers
arrayed against LeSeuer, C. 1!. Davis
and "Jim" Manahan of St. Paul, have
succeeded in sealing his lips. The
presiding judge has ruled that most
of the sensational matter is not rele­
vant or germane to the issues ai
point.
Complaint.'Faultvt.^ ...
II developed early rti
ings that the Youmaji complaint is
faulty in that he is siiing to recover
the assets of the bank. Proof was
made that he never owned fhem and
lhat what he really meant to ask was
the bank stock. A motion is before
the court fo allow an amendment of
the complaint.
Court Admonished Manahan.
"Doc" Purcell of Wahpeton and
"Jim" Manahan had a tilt early in
the case. Mr. Manhan started his
usual tactics but found that Mr. Pur­
cell could not be bluffed. The court
intervened and Mr. Manahan was ad­
monished to observe the rules of evi­
dence and court procedure in trying
the case.
Judge Kneeshaw Presiding.
Judge Kneshaw is presiding and all
members of the.jury are farmers. At
the opening of the court this morning
Arthur LeSeuer made the opening
statements of the case to the jury,
outlining what the plaintiff expected
to prove. His statement followed the
exact lines of the complaint in the
case.
Demurrer Is Entered.
Assistant Attorney General Murphy
entered a demurrer in behalf of the
state officials, who are defendants,
but the demurrer was overruled on
the ground that it was not the course
at this stage of the proceedings. It
should have been filed before the
pleadings were made up and issue
joined, or could come up later after
the court and the facts in the case be­
fore him and could rule intelligently
on the issue raised by pleading.

plaintiff was S. J. Rasmussen of the
Second ational bank and who had

Dr. Waite Gave Embalmer
$18,000 to Dope Fluid
With Solution ot Arsenic
.New York, March 30.—Eugene Oli­
ver Kane, who embalmed the body of
John E. Peck, for whose murder Dr.
Warren Waite is under arrest here,
went to the district attorney's office
tonight and denied he ever had any
intention of testifying that the em­
balming fluid used on Peck's body
contained arsenic.
Given $18,400.
Kane admitted, however, that he
had received $9,000 in cash and a
check for $9,400 from Waite, which
the young dentist has said was to oe
in exchange for swearing that there
was arsenic in the embalming fluid
and placing the poison in a sample
to be delivered to Mr. Swann. Ac­
cording to the embalmer, it was vir­
tually forced upon him. Kane was ac­
companied by his counsel, and al­
though an order for his arrest had
been issued, he was allowed to re­
main at liberty in the custody of his
attorney.
Kane said he was sent to Waite by
Administration In Dark Until
Word Comes Prom
Berlin
ALL EFFORTS MADE
Washington, March 150.—Three days
have passed since Ambassador Ger­
ard was instructed to inquire of the
German government whether any of
its submarines torpedoed the British
channel steamer, Sussex, and the
United States still iswithout an ad­
mission or denial of reponsibiiity.
Nor has any word come from Mr. Ger­
ard on the inquiries he was instruct­
ed to make regarding the attack up­
on the British ship, Englishman, and
Manchester Engineer.
It is assumed here that the German
government is withholding any state­
ment while awaiting report from sub­
marine commanders. Officials are
puzzled, however, by the failure of
the ambassador at. Berlin to make
some kind of response to the state de­
partment's communication. It is.
hoped that, he wii' be heard from to­
morrow when President Wilson prob­
ably will go over the situation with
his cabinet,
In an eCorc to secure conclusive
proof regarding the disasters which
have overtaken the Sussex another
unarmed British merchant ship, carry­
ing American citizens, the United
States is employing every means at
its command. Unless Ambassador
Gerard reports in the near future, he
may be asked the cause of the delay.
The slate department still is pro
ceding with the til most caution.

Good Number of Delegates.
Willi a goodly number of delegates

ly understood, but his identity is
withheld.
The league will nominate candi­

John S. Potter, the undertaker who
had charge of Peck's funeral, and
who told him Waite wanted to ask
him about the embalming fluid. At
Waite's solicitation he met the dent­
ist in a garage, where he said Waite
asked him if he could put arsenic in
a sample of embalming fluid for the
district attorney. Kane replied it
could be done, but that it was against
the law. Waite then offered him a
check for $!,50O, which he said he did
not. want, but he did not return it.
Waite, ne said, promised to make
him comfortable for life.
Urged Haste.
Less than two hours later, he met
Waite in a cigar store by appoint­
ment, although he said he did not
know why Waite wanted to see him.
They both went into a telephone
booth, and \vaite placed a large roll
of bills, which Waite told Mr. Swann
contained £9,0u, into Kane's hand,
saying: 'Now, for God's sake, get that
stuff into the sample, and get it down
to the district attorney's office."

LITERACY TEST
Bill In Form Vetoed By Clevc

Washington, March The Bur­
nett. immigration, hill, with its liter­
acy test and Asia'ic exclusion pro­
visions unchanged, passed the house
today by a vote of .'JOS to .Si. It. now
goes to the seuale where favorable
action is regarded as assurrea.
The literacy vest, about which the
fight against the bill had centered,
was sustained 2SI lo 107. This pro­
vision has been the cause of vetoes of
similar immigration bills by Presi­
dents Cleveland, Taft and Wilson.
The house passed tho bill over the
Cleveland veto, but it failed in the
senate. Motion to override the ve­
toes of Presidents Taft and Wilson
were lost in the house by narrow
margins. Representative "Burnett,
chairman of the immigration commit­
tee, predicted tonight that there was
sufficient strength to repass the bill
in the event of another veto. The
president has not indicated nis pur­
pose to the house leaders.
Both record votes—on the literacy
test and on the passage of the bill—
were without regard to party lines.
Majority Leader Kitchin voted for the
literacy test' and for the bill. Minor­
ity Leader Mann voted against the
literacy test and then for the bill.

Nearly Strangled to Death While
Torturing Five Victims
ACCUSED THEM OF
Murder Five Members.
The murder of live members of the
Palonco family was said to have been
intended as a warning to other Mexi­
cans against having dealings with
Americans.
When Villa, retreating at Columbus,
arrived at Corralitos' ranch, he had a
list of all the Paloncos. Six men, the
mother and two daughters. He seized
the men and hunted for the daugh­
ters, but the young women had been
hidden so well that he never found
them.
To live of the men, Gregorio and his
two sons, Muio and his one son. Villa
said:
Gringo Lovers.
"I am going to kill you because you
are too Americanized. You are grin­
go lovers."
But instead of killing them outright,
Villa had them partly stripped and
then beaten with the flaps of heavy
swords. Mucio Palonco broke away
from his captors and got one hand on
Villa's throat before he was beaten
off. Next, Villa ordered the five stood
up beneath a huge archway when he
told them he would hang them. Ropes
were placed about their necks and
they were jerked into the air, but
were not permitted to die. Finally,
Villa ordered the five men taken into
the garden, where each one was shot
five times. To the residents of the
ranch, all Mexicans, Villa said:
In One Grave.
"You may bury them or not, as you
please."
They were all buried in one grave
after Villa left.
Before going, Villa led one male
member of the family, Gregorio, Jr.,

TO BE CLOSINC
VILLA AND HIS BANDIT All
Clash Considered Matter of a Few Days
Now Unless Fugitive Can Escape
New Net Set for Him
Probably Correct.
This Information was regarded by
General Funston and hiB Btaff as prob­
ably correct. If correct, it appeared
probably that very soon Villa will
have to face his pursuers in fight or
make another break through the
tightening lines of troops.
Whether his assaults on the garri­
sons at Guerrero were the same en*
gagements reported by General .fun­
ston, was not known* but it was con*
sidered likely, since the action report­
ed by General Pershing occurred on
IMarch 27, somewhere in that region.
Details of the engagements were not
reported.
Advised iReport.
General Pershing has been advised
of the report as to Villa's locatiott,
and it. is known that the disposition
of his troops and that of the Mexican
government are such that Villa can­
not easily escape without a fight. Am­
erican troops are converging in col­
umns from the north and it was indi­
cated that a part of them had gonii
so far south that they would be able
to join with the Cnrranza force .In,
Problem Perplexing.
The problem of forwarding snppHes
to the American base at Colonia Dub
Ian by way of the IMexico Northwest­
ern railroad has changed from the
perplexing to the mysterious tonight.
General Bell, apparently on receipt
of instructions from Washington, sim­
ilar to those sent to General Punstton
announced that he could give no
information lo the press regarding
the situation and other officers were
uncommunicative.
The one definite fact it that no sup­
plies have been sent as no train has
left Juarez in the last two days.*
Gasoline Low.
From the little that can be learned
here, it appears that the question of
gasoline supply is one that is causing,
the military authorities the greatest
anxiety. The motor truck trains are
taxed to their capacity to keep an
alequate quantity of food and forage
moving.
As far as the actual pursuit of Villa
is concerned, the absence for several
days of any definite news has given
new birth to the wild rumors and fan­
tastic stories which flooded El Paso
up to a week ago.
Wild Rumors.
Two stories spread broadcast
through Columbus tonight caused the
credulous to fear that Villa is about
to make a second raid in this com­
munity. One story that grew as it
passed from mouth to mouth was
made on a suggestion of Juan Fayel
la, a Mexican ranch hadd, employed
by Mayor H. G. Hoover. Fayella, who
is said to have predicted the raid on
this town March 4, in which several
United States soldiers and civilians
were killed, asserted that he believed
the bandit chieftan, with a small
part of his band, had doubled on his
trail and was now in the vicinity of
Santa Maria, in the Gasman district,
about 65 miles south of the border.
Discredit Story.
Close questioning of both military
and civil authorities however elicited
the fact that his belief was hascd on
a newspaper story that Villa baa re
turned to the north. Military auhor
iies discrediteed the story.
On the heels of this story, a ranch*
man whose name was not made pub*
lie, reported to Major iW. R. Sample,
commandant, that he believed tbe ac­
tions of a Mexican family about two
miles west of town to be suspicious.
He said the lights in the windows on
the south side of the house had been
flashed in a way that might in#Wa
