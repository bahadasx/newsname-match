J. W. Dudley tor Sheriff.
This week wo present the an
nouncement of J. V. Dudley as
candidate for sheriff of Chaves
county, subject to the action of
the democratic primary election.
He is a native of Texas, coming
to the Valley in 1905, where he
lias made his home evr sincei
In commenting on Mr. Dudley
the Itagarman Messenger has
the following to 6ay in his bt
halfi "Mr. Dudley u real sheriff
't'mber'. His temperament, and
other natural qualifications, are
just 6uch as are Heeded in a
sheriff, and his business ability
to perform all the functions of
ttie office is mora than' anipU?,
Ills democracy comes by inher
itence and after reaching the
ge of descretion he confirmed
lus allegiance to that political
faith by Supporting its princi
ples on every occasion. Since
he has been a resident of Chaves
county his political affiliations
have been unosU'iitatious, nev
er the-less enthusiastic and reg
ular
In ' personal character Mr.
Dudley is a good citizen
and a gentleman of unquestion
ed integrity, tits ambition to
bo sheriff of Chaves county is
prompted as much by a 'desire
to servo as it is by selfish mot
iven,and in the 'event of his
nomination and subsequent elec
tion, he promises to discharge
th duties of the ofllce with fidel
ity to the common good, asking
no favors only the co-operation
of every good citizen to tho end
that all law abiding citizens
may bfc protected and all infrac
tions of tho law may be punished."

And then right out of the blue iky'
there had dropped Dick. It had
most seemed part of the summer rou
tine that I )ick should appear 60oner or
lat:r. Hut there had been trouble be
tween them, and the day she had been
swept out to sea past the lifelines it
had been Dick who bad swam to the
rescue and brought her back.
"But you needn't have treated him'
tho way yod did Just for that," Clifford
had said, most disagreeably. "I've
caved lots of girls' lives, but they
didn't act as if I was a hero."
"J didn't," Gwen had auswered pleas
antly. "I Jut treated him like a dear
old friend. 1'V knoirn Dick for years.",
"And you've known me just six
weeks. Which do you like the best so
far?" It was impossible to stay angry
very long with Cliff's good-natured
fare smiling at one. They had really,
been wonderfully good friends until he
had stepped over the border land of
good faith and proposed to her.
"I don't suppose you can help it, but'
I'm 30 sick and tired of playing heart'
ba'in for every boy I know. They 1I
propose sooner or later Just from hab-'
it, I do believe, or because they know.
I won't accept "
"Why won't you" ,
"Don't you really know? 1'ncl'
Stanhope left all his money to his fa
vorite sister, Aunt Adelaide, and she's
an unbeliever in men" Gwen's brown
eyes were sparkling with fun. "So she'
put half In trust for me until I was
twenty-one on condition that I didn't;
marry by then and the other half when
I am thirty on condition that I am not'
married then.""
"What if you do?" .
"It all goes to some charity. She's
very peculiar."
"If you really, loved the right man,
you'd throw the whole thing up in the
air," Cliff had returned. "I never would
havo thought you were mercenary."
That had been hi late August, IS'ow
it was December and be was visiting
Hatty Madison. She had seen him sev
eral times, but that one word would'
come between them. lie had suggest
ed that she was mercenary. Today
bhe waited until her mother and Aunt
Adelaide were comfortably settled t
the chulr car before she even permit
ted herself to remember that the only
man she had ever really missed was in
the next car.
It did seem as if Aunt Addle was un-;
usually try(nft.v Khe wanted to recline,
then she wanted to go out on the ob
servation and get a breath of fresh'
air, then che wanted some cracked ice,
and filially ehe wanted to play bridge.'
It was five hours to llonton and uh
simply couldn't stand U without soma'
diversion, and she wished che hadn't
come anyway. Just then she beamed
rud'antly on somebody cumlng along;
the aisle, and lo! 1t was Cliff.
'"Well, if it Isn't Clilfle iMgelow," she'
exclaimed. "Come here, child. I've
known him, Owen, since he was knee
high to a toadstool; lived next us at
Wcstoll for years when your uncle waat
alive. How's your mother, Cliflte? Do
ing pvelty well for her age, isn't she?.
Sit down and take a hand, for pity's
uke." '
liwen never forgot those five hour.
It seemed as if Aunt Adelaide wai; poi
hcHse l; make her unhappy. She tola?
stories of Cliff whon he was a littl
boy and a big boy, and how he had
saved her life once when old Gray
Kiiglo took fright at the morning ex
press and ran away with her and Cliff
had stopped him.
"You know, as Jong as we're going
out home for a few weeks, I kind of
think I'll have you stay with us, Cliff.
The folks will be up In Boston, aad the
bonne is all closed up. You're going
to Weston, ain't you?"
"Why, no, nia'um. I was on my way
to Boston"
"Nonsenae. Come along with us.
Maybe you and Gwen can comfort
each other, for I declare she's the
incipient girl I ever saw since last
summer. Go out on the platform, you
two, end see It we're near Providence
yet. 1 want to get a look at Provi
dence." They stood together on the observa
tion plutform, and Gwen was laughing
biting her lip to keep from It, but
laughing.
"Suppose ,o bad been married and
I'd have had the money to chase after
gypsy moths?" Clifford leaned against
the door and looked at her. "Isn't she
a regular old dear, though? I never
knew sho was your aunt, t take it
back, Gwen, about your being- merce
nary." (Copyright, W by the McClura Newspa
