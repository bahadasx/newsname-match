Santa Fa Goverenr William Me
Itonald hat issued the following proc
lamation: "For several years the nation has
been interested la the conservation a.'
our na'ural resources and w have
paid special attentlou to the planting
and protection of trees. We have no
discovered the necessity of preserving
all song and Insectivorous birds. It Is
said that If all the Insect eating blrda
were destroyed, th! whole continent
would in three years become uninhab
itable by reason or the myraids of In
sects. We should brlug back the birds
to protect our grains, plants and
trees. And, while wn are impressed
with tin economic value of these
things, we bear In mtud also the'r
esthetic value. The beauty of shade
and forest trees and tin- sweetnesi
of wild birds' songs please our sen set
snd increase vastly our enjoyment in
living.
"Special days for the consideration
of these interests ar necessary as in
our rush of dully affairs there Is lit
tle time to think carefully of many
claims upon our attention. The day
selected in New Mexico should be ob
served by schools and coiumunitiet,
not lu idleness, but in practical meas
ures to insure the ends mo are seek
ing, and In such exm-laes as shall In
culcate permanently In our minds the
habits of thinking that shall lead to
these ends. The actual planting of
trees may be done on the tiays desig
nated oi nt such otlnr convenient
times as may best conform to local
climatic conditions.
"Therefore, under the Acts of the
slate legislature passed, "to encour
age th.t planting of forest tices for
the benefit und adornment of public
and private grounds, places and
ways," and to encourage the protec
tion of birds. I, William C. McDonald,
governor of the statu or New Mexico,
do hereby designate Friday, Mnreii
21st. and Friday, April II, as Arbor
and Blrl Days."
