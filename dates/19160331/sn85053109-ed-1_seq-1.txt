Town Dads Show
Sense of Chivalry
Nearly All The Election
Officers Are to be
Women
The honorable town fathers
have shown a sense of gallantry
and Chivalry worthy of a Ches
terfield or Don Quixote, in the
appointment of judges of elec
tion. All the judges at the
coming election are of the
"eternal feminine" variety, with
one exception in each ward,
and the town fathers are to be
commended for their gallantry
and good sense. Following are
the judges named for the two
wards, at the city election to
be held next Monday, April 3.
First Ward: Mrs. R. L. Taft,
Mrs. P. B. Anderson, Mrs. M. J.
Halvorson, Mrs. Ella Brown
and Frank VanDemark.
Second Ward: Mrs. G. C.
Madison, Mrs. B. R. McNamer,
Mrs. J. P. Johnson, Mrs. H. G.
Putt and C. N. Thomas.
The political horizon contains
naught of shadow, there being
not the tiniest speck of cloud
visible, up to this morning.
However, there are subtle and
persistent hints that another
ticket is being "framed" and
election morning may bring
something forth. We shall
know when we shall know-~
and that will be election even
ing.
Sure We Have Oil
C. W. Bailey, whose home
stead is not far from tfee Cana
dian boundary and six miles
east of the Reservation line,
was greatly interested in the
article recently published in the
Pioneer Press relative to the
existence of coal in that sec
tion and has sent to Washing
ton for the geological survey re
port. Mr. Bailey has a spring
on his ranch that shows a dis
tinct oil seepage and he seems
to think the seepage is growing
more pronounced all the time.
As he was for many years en
gaged in the mining of coal and
also worked in the oil fields of
the southwest, he feels that he
has more than ordinary know
ledge of such matters, and firm
ly believes that both coal and
oil exist in this section.
City Clerk VanDemark has
requested us to state the loca
tion of the voting place for the
First Ward has been changed
from the old school house to

A fight of a strictly rough-and
tumble nature was pulled off on the
public square the other day. A
large crowd surrounded them, none
daring, ivideutly, to "intervene;"
and, their faces covered with gore,
the combatants were doing their
best to mutilate each other, when
along came liev. Dr. Gold, a firm
believer in intervention, who with
out a moment's hesitation hegan a
laudable effort to separate the war
riors. Unlike Henry Ford, he got
right into the trenches, became
spattered with blood and dirt, and
was rewarded in his endeavors by
two husky young fellows who saw
his pluck and came to his assistance.
The men of strife were separated
by sheer strength and awkward
ness, when, true to their well-known
proclivities, two policemen arrived
on the sceue after the dirty work
was finished and took the scrappers
to the cooler, where, doubtless,
their heated passions received a
decided chill. Hats off to the cour
ageous minister!
Dr. Gold preached at the St.
Goddard ranch last week, and made
a trip through the Heart Butte and
Big Badger country. He is loud
in his praise of the possibilities of
that section. He says the govern
ment herd of cows down there is
having a high calving ratio. Many
of the Indians told him that they
intended putting in large crops of
root stuff this year. Not one of the
government herd has been butch
ered, or otherwise interfered with.
Mr. Ferris, the stock supervisor, is
much beloved by everybody in that
country, as is also Stewart Hazlett,
the farmer, and Mr. and Mrs. Van
Campen, the school teachers. He
found "Jim" Walters at work on
the fifty new houses being built or
repaired for the Indians.
Mr. Ellis and Mr. Ferris gave the
Indians some mighty wholesome ad
vice at the council meeting last
Saturday. If the wishes and ideas
of these men are carried out a bet
ter day for the people of of our
tribe is dawning.
Mr. and Mrs. Selecman have
made a fine record this year in their
public school work here. The good
principal has left no stone unturned
to help the school and build up the
moral and educational interests of
his pupils and the community.
Mrs. McKay, who lives near the
town irrigation ditch, is very low
at this writing. Her son, George
Robinson, and her daughter, Mrs.
Spence, are here assisting her hus
band to wait on her.
Charlie Conway is having a hard
attack of sore throat. Charlie can't
even call the cow. Many others are
suffering more or less with the same
disease at present.
W. II. Meade of Glacier Park
was in our city the other day. Wil
liam is still bragging about that boy
of his.
The Reclamation clerks are be
ginning to arrange for their return
to the Northern camps again.
The Condon brothers seem to be

Mrs. Scriver is indisposed, we

Senators Discuss Status of Indians
Opening of Blackfeet Reservation
Sen. Walsh an Adtive Participant
The question of opening the
the Blackfeet Indian Reser
vation flashed momentarily be
fore the Senate the other day
and then floated over the dome
of the capitol and down the his
toric Potomac. The following
account of the discussion ap
peared in the Montana dailies
the first of the week:
Urging an appropriation of
$100,000 from funds of the
Blackfeet Indians to introduce
live stock and agricultural pur
suits among them. Senator
Walsh said the situation of
that reservation was somewhat
deplorable and that at present
rations were being issued for
800 of the 2,700 Indians of the
reservation and the severe
winter would result in many
many deaths among them.
Mr. Meritt said there were two
delegations in the city on the
matter of disposing of some of
their lands, but they were un
able to agree on any proposed
legislation.
Senators Page and Lane op
posed the item for a building
for an exhibit of Indian porducts
at the Western Fair at Missoula
and said they would oppose it
in the senate. They said the
money should instead be used
in helping the Indians to earn a
living, house and feed them.
Senator Lane referred to the
deplorable conditions surround
ing the homes of the Blackfeet
Indians which were confirmed
by Serfator Walsh. Mr. Meritt
said the bureau had improved
their conditions but there was
room for improvement. He
recommended an appropriation
of $200,000 to build homes for
these Indians.
Senator Walsh reviewed the
history of reservation, referring
to the act of 1907 to open the
reservation and the fact that j
there was a disposition in the !

interior department not to open
it. He spoke of the value of
the lands for grazing purposes,
but said the leases for grazing
had been renewed. He criticised
the unbusinesslike management
of the reservation saying the
Indians had lost between $00,000
and $75,000 because of the ter
mination of the grazing leases.
The reservation would afford
grazing for 50,000 head of cattle.
Mr. Meritt said if the act of
1907 to open the reservation
was carried into effect the
Blackfeet Indians would be in
a much more deplorable con
dition. Unless congress amend
ed the act there was no hope
for the Indians, he said.
Senator Walsh favored stock
ing the reservation with cattle.
He also said the Indians
would enjoy every advantage
and benefit if the reservation
were opened to cattlemen. As
it was a vast amount of forage
was going to waste.
Senator Page favored holding
the lands for several years to
secure higher prices. Senator
Walsh had no doubt the land
value would advance. "Land
values are going up in Montana,
and the immigration in the
last couple of years has been
very large," he said. "Nearly
one-third of all the land entries
in the country were made in
Montana last year and crops
have been good and land prices
arelilgher now. These things
go in waves and there will be a
recession again, then after a
period of years the rise will
come again and the crest will
be higher than before. But
there is no reason for hesitating
in disposing of the lands in the
hope that the Indians will take
up the lands and cultivate them.
The Indian is not an agriculturist

resident manager for the Great
Falls Lumber company in this
city for the past six years, has
tendered his resignation to the
company and will retire from
that firm the first of April.
Mr. Alquist has large land in
terests which require a con
siderable portion of his time,
and during the winter he be
crme heavily interested in the
Pondera Valley Auto comDany

completing a fine twenty-thou
sand dollar garage. Mr. Alquist
will handle the automobile
sales end of this new firm and
will devote much of his time to
the active management of the
business of the concern. With
his private interests his
time was too much taken up to
give the lumber business the
time it required, and he decided
to resign.

Redfield Urges all
To Save Old Paper
Says Country Faces Very
Serious Paper
Famine
"The attention of the depart
ment of commerce is called, by
the president of a large paper
manufacturing conpany, to the
fact that there is a serious short
age of raw material for the
manufacture of papers. He
urges that the department
should make it known that the
collecting and saving of rag and
old papers would greatly better
existing conditions for Ameri
can manufacturers.
"Something like 15,000 tons
of different kinds of paper and
paper board are manufactured
every day in the United States
and a large proportion of this,
after it has served its purpose,
could be used over again in
some class of paper. A large
part of it, however, is either
burned or other-wise wasted.
This, of course, has to be re
placed by new materials. In
the early history of the paper
industry publicity was given to
the importance of saving rags.
It is of scarcely less importance
now. The department of com
merce is glad to bring this mat
ter to the attention of the pub
lic in the hope that practical
results may flow from it. A
little attention to the saving of
rags and old papers will mean
genuine relief to our paper in
dustry and a diminishing drain
upon ouf Wi/iies df supply for
new materials.
"A list of dealers in paper
stocks can be obtained from the
local chamber of commerce or
board of trade.

Mr. Meigs, of Great Falls, after
which they organized for the
