Mucio 1'olanco was the name of the
Mexican who almost succeeded in end
ing Villa's career.
The murder of Ave members of the
Polanco family was said to have been
intended as a warning to other Mexi
cans against having dealings with
Americans. Investigation showed that
the Polanco family was involve** with
no political faction in Mexico, but that
they had a record of uniform honesty
and reliability in dealing with t'no
American managers of the Corralitos
ranch, whete they were born and
reared.
When Villa, retreating from Colum
bus. arrived at the ranch, he had a list
