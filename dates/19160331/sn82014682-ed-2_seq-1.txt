; Military Roads, Sewer System
at Schof leld, Adequate Bar
,;,., racks Among Items
To call at an early date In Honolulu
a big conference on preparedness, at
which all the interests of Hawaii will
be represented -that Is the new plan
- of the Chamber of Commerce, Vhich
'has the support of many array offi
cials,, of Brlgr-gen. Samuel I. Johnson
of the National Guard of 1 la wall, and
of others interested in measures for
the adequate defense of the Hawaiian
.Islands. - . - "" ' . ':
A military, road ground Oahu, an
adequate sewage disposal system at
. Schof leld Darracks, ; better barracks
for the men these are a. few. of the
important questions to be taken up,
and cn which resolutions and recom
mendations will be . passed and for-
- warded to Congress through the
agency of Delegate Kalanlanaole,
The Idea back o. tne conference Is
not in any way to la trade on the act-
Ivltles of officers of the Hawaiian De
partment,, or to attempt to meddle
wltli department plana, but to let
Tcngress know how the civilian pop
ulation of . Oahu regards army needs
here. , ? - --. . '
t .Amy regulations .prohibit officers
rending 'Communications to Congress
.direct, and it' is hoped that some of
'the resolutions and recommendations
: may reflect the needs here which are
apparent to civilians who know aer
; vice people. . ; . :'' .. ;"
It is pointed out that preparedness
In Its broad sense Is too general a
term for the average; citizen. .tot act
; upon, but that if he 4s given a chance
to study ccnditlons In his own local
ity and learn how best to defend -his
land TV.- tAs hoTrre" from the encroach
racnts of a poBsIble enemy the word
cereals to him much more. v ;
It is Just. this-which. the proposed
conference will try to do to educate
the people of Honolulu and the Ha
waiian islands to the needs. of thefr
own soil in time of war. . ' '
If the citizen population can be ed
ucated to defense measures which ap
ply ; to the islands especially, much
will be done in their protection, ac
cording to army Officials.

k!nd.. - : : s.'. '
The Chamber of Commerce in Spo

Iii TULLY PLAY
Talented Young Ladies , Will 6e
Welcomed to the Cast of li
: "Bird of Paradisj ; :
. A Hawaiian young lady for-tbe star
part k in-.'The Bird of Paradise" may
be featured if the plana of Richard
waltoa Tully,-author and-, playwright,
go through.. Hr.vTullyf with. hieiwlfe
who was. Miss .Gladys Hanna. a dau'aH-'
terr of , a Toronto 'clergy man, arrived
in Honolulu this morning on the Great
Northern and will . remain until ' the
Jlill liner departs on Tuesday.4 ; - f ;
When asked. as the reason for his
visit here, Mr. Tully said that-he is
here only to visit the Paradise of tie
Pacific, but would be pleased to tneet
candidates for the cast of the "Bird
of Paradise" companies. Mr. Tully
has planned to fill his cast with Ha
waiians, and expects that in a few
years all of the prominent parts win
do piayea oy natives or Hawaii. t.
Asked as to how he would make his
choice he stated that he would be at
the Hawaiian Opera House Monday
morning to receive all candidates for
a place in the cast He said that if
there is a Hawaiian or part-Hawaiian
girl who haa talent, she will be given
first consideration for the leading role
in ."The Brd of Paradise ;
"The Bird of Paradise" is at tie
heights of its career and next season
it is expected that a number of com
panies triil be on toiuv Vhen the play
was first presented in New York. Mr.
Tully says, the managers said that it
would go well withrrankfurters and
sauerkraut at Coney Island, But would
not be appreciated on Broadway.
In the five years that the play has
been produced It has reached a point
where it is playing to capacity houses,
and Mr. Tully expecu that the pro
duction will continue to be a success
for Ihe next ten years. He is anxious
to have Hawatians in the cast, and if
any young lady here can show ability
in dramatics, tsh will be given an op
portunity to star in the production.
"There has been a number . 61
things written of the play which did
not follow out the ideals of Hawaii,"
said Mr. TuUy, -but I have tried to
cling to facts as much as is, possible
in playing to a mainland public, and
the fact that the play is doing better
in the fifth year means that it has
made good. . " -"
"East is east and west is west and
never the twain shall meet,' said Kip
ling, and I say that they never shall
meet, . because a Paradise is In be
tween. Hawaii has a charm all of Its
own, and I felt the charm as I neared
the city this morning, and entered one
of tUe sweetest spots In all the uni
verse. r The people of Hawaii have
been more than kind to me and if
The Bird of Paradise" has helped to
bring people here, it is only a measure
of what I would like to do in return
for those who have helped to make
The Bird of Paradise' a success.
