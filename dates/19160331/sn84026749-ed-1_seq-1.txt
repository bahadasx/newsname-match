E PIRATE
Case of German Youth Who
"Captured" British Vessel
Puzzles Authorities.
SAYS HE HAD CONFEDERATES
LEWES, Del., March 31.
Ernest Schiller, the twenty-four-yetr-pld
German, who single
handed captured a British ship
juaf outside New York harbor, may
be hanged by the British authori
ties as a pirate.
Schiller is held here wh'le the
Delaware authorities arc puzzling
over what disposition they shall
make of -him.
If it is proven that the steamer
Matoppo was outside the three
mile limit when the stow-away held
her up, he belongs legally in the
class with Captain Kidd jn "com
mitting an act of piracy on the
high seas."
With no trace of bravado, Schil
ler today told how he played the
role of pirate within an hour's
Bailing of Broadway.
OTHERS IMPLICATED.
Schiller confessed that others were
Implicated. Tour fellow conspirators,
he said, were to have stowed away with
him aboard thn Matoppo. When the ship
passed off Sandy Hook they planned
to overpower her officers, cow the
Chinese crew by a display of arms and
ir.ake a run for the high seas.
.lis four confederates backed out a
few hours before the ship sailed from
Hoboken. Schiller decide to carry out
the program alone, but planned to
make his escape to thn Delaware shore
after looting the captain's safe. He re
fused to name the four men.
Saved by Girl's Picture.
Schiller told Magistrate rtcststrar and
Captain Eergncr that he had planned to
run the easel on the rocks at the Dela
ware Ureakwntcr, but tho picture of
Captain Uersner'a daughter In his cabin
was what caused him to demand to bo

nr.RI.IS, Match 31. mbns.iadqr.i
Ge.rard anil I'entlcld and Minister Van
Dyke nt The Hacue have lolncd In n
protest to the State Department against
the continued use of the present Ameri
can diplomatic code.
The State Department at Washington,
replying to n recent Fnlted Piess d -patch
from t'eiiln, slating that ttw
Vnlled States tecret code was novrn to
I.uropcau belligerents, Insisted that fe
cret dispatches could still lie sent
"That Is what the department alwavi
says," said an Ameilcan official fully
in touch wlHi the situation. "You'll tlnd
the codo wlh not be changed until It ia
too late."
It was learned today that an Ameri
can code book was stolen from an
attache of tho American mJnliter. ,to
the Halkans shortly before t.he outbreak
of the war. Secret Service men tried
for week to trace it beforo th loss
waa communicated to Washington.
It Is not known what belligerent pos
sesses this volume, but the American en
voys arc convinced that every impor
tant Kuropcun power can read not only
the diplomatic but even the naval secrot
codes.
About seven months ago an official
mall pouch, carrying a highly Important
secret report to the Navy Department
fiom an observer In Germany was
opened after It left London.
The secret report was unsealed and
when it reached Washington showed
much handling.
In many of the fotelgn embassies and
legations Kngllsh, Kronen, German and
other foreign attaencs nave acted as
American code exports. It Is oulte pos
sible that several men who have han
dled tho American diplomatic code are
now in the employ or European govern
ments.
New Tax Salts Law
For District Urged
Commissioners Say It Would Clear
Books and Records of Many
Cases.
With a recommendation for its pas-
cage the Commissioners sent to Con
gress today a bill "to provide an addi
tional method for enforcing and fore
closing tax sales In the Dish let."
Tho enactment of the measure, they
say nl a letter to Chairman Hen John
son, of the House District Committee,
would result in clearing the books and
records of many cases of back taxes.
nnd probably would rcduCo the number
of sales for non-payment of taxes.
The proposed legislation would enable
the District, when It has become tho
purchaser of property sold nt the annual
tax sale for non-payment of taxes, to
obtain after two years " a Urn on the
pioperty, which may be coin cited Into
cash.
I'nder the present law. the District,
which buys all propcity offctcd at the
annual tax sale on which no other bids
aro received, has difficulty in enforcing
its liens.

"FLYING COLUMN" IN
MAD DASH TO FORCE
BANDIT INTO BATTLE
General Funston Warns Against "Unauthen
tic Reports of Casualties' Shots Ex
changed When Dodd's Men' Locate
Bandit Along Railroad.
By H. D.JACOBS,
FIELD HEADQUARTERS-AMERICAN ARMY,
NEAR DUBLAN, MEXICO (by aeroplane to Colum
bus, N. M.), March 31. Villa may be brought to bay
within a short time. There is a distinct feeling around
Brigadier General Pershing's headquarters today that
important, developments in the pursuit are impending.
SAN ANTONIO, March 31. American troops have
' caught up with. Francisco Villa, fired upon a portion of his
forces, and are now making- a tremendous .effort to chjgk'
his. headlong flight-.ajid force-htfti to figlil:
JlAfter a week bf'Jiard marching, Villus .main- force has
been located working along the railroad which extends
south from Guerrero and the rear guard fired upon by the
pursuing American troops, according to reports reach'ing
General Funston.
Funston said they came from sources which he be
lieves thoroughly reliable, but refused to name them.
General Funston is certain actual fighting has oc
curred between United States soldiers and Villista bandits.
"Our reports declare Villa has received strong re-enforcements,"
said General Funston. "But we are confident
our capable, men, under strong leadership, will be able to
take care of themselves. Some of our isolated detach
ments are bound to suffer, but if Villa's troops make a
stand against anv of our larger forces he will discover their
mettle."
CARRANZISTAS ARE CO-OPERATING.
Funston's reports, which were received last night and
early today, asserted that Carranzistas are co-operating
fully with the American troops in a supreme elTort to make
Villa abandon his flight and make a stand. General Fun
ston considers this the only hope for the American punitive
expedition to accomplish its purpose.
"Uuless we can bring Villa to decisive lighting," said
Funston, "he can continue his flight straight through to
Central America, and I hate to consider the difficulties of
maintaining a line of communication from Columbus very
much farther south."
Forestalling the usual crop of rumors, General Fun
ston said there undoubtedly would be unauthentic reports
. f American casualties.
General Pershing apparently warned that Villa was
about to make a stand, is at the front with his men. Ac
cording to Funston, the superior leadership of the Amer
ican general will more than offset any numerical superi
ority the Villistas may offer.
General Funston refused to give details which might
divulge the location of the main column of American
,troops. The Villistas, he sta.ted, following their clash with
a Carranza force at Guerrero, went south through Minaca,
following the railroad to the southwest.
General Funston remained silent on the railway mat
ter, but admitted no supplies have yet been shipped over
the Mexico Northwestern.
