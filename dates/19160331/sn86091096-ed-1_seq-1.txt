Many Point« of Interest Were
Visited
Following is an account of Mr
and Mrs. Hull's eastern trip. They
have kindly furnished the Gazette
with some of the most important
incidents of the trip. They visited
number of former residents of
Kendrick and we believe our read
■ers will be interested to hear of
them.
"Having been asked to tell of
our trip east, would state that we
left Kendrick January 10. Our
first st6p was in Spokane where we
visited Mrs. Hull's sister. Eighteen
of the family sat down to a New
England dinner.
Sand point was the next stop.
The thermometer registered below
zero and the snow drifts were from
one to six feet deep. We met Mr.
and Mrs. D. J. Rowlands, formerly
of Kendrick; also Himes the photo
grapher, now mayor of Sandpoint;
and Nagle, who used to be the N.
P. Agent here. From Sandpoint to
Minneapolis the weather was very
cold, the temperature at Dickinson,
Mont., was fifty-six below zero.
We were met in Minneapolis by
Mr. Hull's son and daughter who
took us to Melrose in their private
car. While there we saw the "Birth
of a Nation." In Minneapolis we
spent the day with Mrs. Case, mother
of Mrs. Hoyt.
We stopped a while in Chicago
and from there went to Owego, N.
Y., the burial place of Pocahontis.
From there we went to Ithaca, N.
Y., where Cornell University is
located and visited a sister, Mrs. P.
Golden.
At Springfield, Mass., we were
guests of the Shermans. Mrs.
Sherman' is known in Kendrick as
Miss Icy Curtis and was a former
teacher here. Her husband is
physical director in the Y. M. C. A.
We visited many historical places
of interest at Boston, among them
the old state house, Bunker Hill
Monument, Old Church, and the
Book Store Around the Corner,
places for which Boston is renown
ed. At Harvard University we saw
Ralph Greene, whose father used to
be depot agent here.
From Lewiston, Maine, Mrs.
Hull's old home, we took a trip
with Mrs. Hull's sister and friends
to the White Mountains in New
Hampshire. We also saw the
paper mills in operation.
On our return home we stopped
two days in Chicago on account of
sickness, and spent a short time in
Kansas City on business, and from
there went to Independence, Kan
sas, where we met many old friends.
At Salina, Kansas, we stayed with
Mr. Hull's son, C. B. Hull, former
ly a merchant of Juliaetta. Most
of the time at Salina Mr. Hull suf
fered with the grippe which settled
into rheumatism.
We stayed in Denver a week. In
f at Falls, Montana, we visited a
grandchild.
The railroad service in the east !s
no better than in the west, in fact
the cars are not so good and the
accomodations generally do not
come up to what we are used to on
our western roads.
• iVe are glad to be home once
more and in all our ten thousand
mile journey we found no better
country than Kendrick and vicinity."
Jeff Fowler Sells a Farm
Jeff Fowler handled a real estate
deal last week. He sold the E. T.
Lundt place, located in Wauncl er
gulch, to Lewis Ogden. The place
consisted of sixty acres and the con
sideration was $25,000.
TRAIN DERAILMENT ON
GRANGEVILLE LINE
A freight train on the line
of the Camas Prairie Railway
Company was derailed Tues
day afternoon about 1 o'clock
in a rock cut at the top of the
Culdesac hill and all traffice
was blockaded until 10 o'clock
that night. The derailment
was caused by a rigid truck
on a top-heavy lumber load
and ten cars left the rails but
all remained on the ties. No
damage to rolling stock or
freight was susstained.
NEZPERGE INDIANS
HOLDJSTITUTES
To Prepare Indians For End
of Trust Period
Superintendent Theodore Sharp,
of the Nez Perce Indian Agency,
and other officials of the Indian
service, were in Nez Perce Friday
conducting an institute for Indians
at the government school. An in
stitute was held at Stites on Wednes
day, Kooskia Thursday and Nez
Perce Friday. The one held Friday
will close the institute work for the
year with the exception of a meet
ing to be arranged for Ahsahka for
some later date.
The officials have organized their
work with a view of preparing the
Nez Perce Indians for the expira
tion of the trust period after which
they will be thrown upon their own
resources. The Indians are being
taught how to farm their land, how
to successfully handle livestock, how
to grow and care for fruit, how to
raise their families and how to
handle their own business affairs.
The institute work was inaugurated
on the Nez Perce reservation about
four years ago and the efforts of
the officials have been highly satis
factory.
The institutes have brought about
a marked improvement about the
Indian homes, have induced a large
number to engage in the farming
of their lands and has aroused a
desire to become efficient in the
many duties incident to successful
farm operation. At the Stites meet
ing, there were more than 50 in
attendance, an equal number at
tended the Kooskia meeting and
more than 65 Indian men and women
gave the speakers the closest at
tention at the meeting held at Nez
Perce. Prominent Indians were
speakers on the program at Kooskia
and Kamiah and at the former place
a boys' and girls' corn and poultry
club for Indian children was or
ganized with a membership of 12.
The officials are not only teaching
the men but they are also instruct
ing the women and they have found
the latter very apt pupils. The
talks to the women deal with the
care of their babies, the care of
their homes, the preparation and
protection of their foods, the cann
ing of fruits and vegetables and
the preserving of sanitary conditions
about their homes.
Rodgers Installs Shop
Jim Rodgers is putting in an up
to-date carpenter shop next to the
State Bank. He has purchased
some expensive machinery to be
used in his shop and also a motor
with which to run the machinery.
With the outfit he now has he will
be able to turn out first class
work and a large amount of it.
klr. Rodgers is an experienced
carpenter and wood worker and he
will make a specialty of all lines of
carpenter and cabinet work. This
is another enterprise for Kendrick
and the Gazette wishes Mr. Rodgers
! success.

GRAN ELEVATOR FOR
THE CIIIIS PRAIRIE
----
Decision of Farmers Who
Met at Nezperce.
Grain elevators to handle the
crops in bulk will be erected at all
points on the prairie where ware
houses now are used. This was the
decision of the farmers who met at
Nez Perce last Saturday afternoon.
The matter has been under discus
sion for several weeks and a definite
decision was reached at the meet
irig Saturday which was largely
attended.
The information brought out at
the meeting is that the present
price of grain bags is fifteen cents
and dealers will not contract to
supply the bags necessary to handle
the 1916 crop even at that price.
This condition forced the farmers
to resort to the elevator plan, and
it is stated there will be no delay
in the matter of beginning the con
struction work.
The plan outlined is that gran
aries will be erected by farmers on
the farms and in some instances
granaries will be built by the far
mers adjoining the elevator build
ings and connections made so that
the grain can be handled at any
time. The grain will be stored in
the farm elevators at the time of
threshing and in cases where gran
aries have been erected in connec
tion with the elevator, a portion of
the crop will be moved to the
shipping point. These farmers will
aim to have about one-half their
crop in readiness for immediate
delivery in order that they may
take advantage of the best markets.
When the granaries at the elevators
are emptied the remainder of the
crop will be moved in.
It is stated a large number of
the farmers have placed their or
ders for the materials necessary to
erect the farm granaries and the
construction of these buildings will
be commenced as soon as the spring
work has been completed.
Davis Moves to Montana
J. W. Davis, Sr., left this week
with a car of emigrant movables
and some stock. He expects to
locate near his son, Ernest, who has
a homestead near Winifred, Mont.
CHUG DIT DINNER
TO BE ONIPRIL5TH.
Have You Forgotten About
This?
Of course you haven't! April 5th
is the day the ladies of the Ken
drick Study Club serve tea and
dinner at Mrs. Crowe's home. From
2 to 5 P. M. tea and cake can be
had for ten cents; and, from 5 to 7
P. M. a delicious dinner, entirely
home cooked will be served for
twenty-five cents. The Study Club
boasts a large number of Kendrick's
best cooks, so come and sample
their wares.
During the evening the following
program will be given :
Music, Male Quartette; Selected
Reading, Miss Hoyt; Music, "Old
Black Joe" and "Good-bye, Sweet
heart, Good-bye," Boy's Quartette ;
{Selected Reading, Elvira Atchison;
Negro Melodies, (Banjo accompani
ment), Mr. Gibbs; Selected Read
ing, Jo Guy.
The decoration committee have
been very secretive about their de
corations so we are assured that
they must have a delightful sur
prise for you all.
As April 5th is Civic Day, the
proceeds go toward some civic im
provement. Kendrick offers an un
limited ■field to choose from; but,
from amidst its wide assortment,
one of immediate need is a combina
tion rest and reading room with, of
course, a library. Accordingly the
ladies have decided to give the
money received on Civic Day as a
nest-egg towards a library fund.
Now, the ladies can't do it all. A
library, more than any other in
stitution must be a community
affair. So it is up to every citizen,
old or young, to determine whether
it shall be a humming- bird's nest
egg or an ostrich's. Then let's not
stop, weary of well doing; but keep
on until it hatches and the Ken
drick Library will po longer be an
unrealized ambition but an accom
plished reality.
French a Kendrick Visitor
Hon. Burton L. French was in
Kendrick Thursday visiting his
mother. He returned to his home
in Moscow Thursday afternoon.
AMERICANS PERMITTED
TO USE RAILWAY
One of the army's most seri
ous problems in hunting Villa
was solved Wednesday when
General Carranza granted the
renewed request of the state
department for permission to
use the Mexican Northwestern
railroad. The first train bear
ing supplies to General Per
shing's troops at the front left
Juaraz Thursday. This will
materially aid the American
troops, who have invaded Mex
ico to capture Villa.
AGRICULTURAL GLOBS
BEING MED HERE
Meeting Held in Schoolhouse
Tuesday Evening
A meeting weis held in Kendrick
at the high school auditorium,
Tuesday evening, for the purpose
of organizing boys' and girls' agri
cultural clubs. This work, in Ida
ho, is carried on by the Extension
Department of the University of
Idaho, with the help and coopera
tion of the U. S. Department of
Agriculture, Washington, D. C.
The clubs in each county are under
the immediate supervision of the
county superintendent.
T. W. Potter, County Superinten
dent Bryden, and Miss Elizabeth
Harcourt, of Lewiston, conducted
the meeting here. The work will
be taken up in this district at once.
Prof. Best and N. B. Long are
greatly interested and with the co
operation of the teachers and
parents of Kendrick the work will'
no doubt be a success.
The object of the work is to
interest boys and girls in the study
of agriculture and home economics;
teach them to be producers and
business managers and give them
much needed practical education
along with their book learning. It
gives them a better idea of rural
life and rural pursuits and will
help them to improve conditions in
the community in which they live.
The organization of the club is
simple. Five or more boys or girls
between the ages of ten and eight
een years, who will sign the pledge
and comply with the requirements,
may select a project and form a
club. From their own number they
select a president and secretary to
serve for one year. The club secre
tary makes out the enrollment
register in triplicate and forwards
all to the University Extension De
partment, Boise, Idaho, at which
office, one copy is retained, one is
sent to the County Superintendent,
and one to the Department at
Washington, D. C.
The club work has been a great
success all over the state and the
interest is increasing. In Idaho
alone the boys and girls clubs pro
duced $49,330.
A Suggestion
Why wouldn't it pay to keep a
man on each one pf the grades
during the bad weather—a "track
walker" so to speak. This is done
on one of the long grades leading
out of Juliaetta and those who have
occassion to travel this grade say
it is in the best condition of any in
the Potlatch canyon. During the
unusually rainy weather we have
been having, the water follows the
wheel tracks for many rods and
washes deep ruts in the road. No
matter how well the road has been
graded the water will follow the
wheel tracks unless it is turned out
of the road at the time when the
rains occur.
RURIL MAIL CARRIER
HIS GOOD RECORD
Completes Twelve Years of
Service on Route
April 1, 1916, J. I. Mitcham will
have completed twelve years of
service out of Kendrick on route
one. During all these years he has
never missed a trip, except on his
vacations, and has never turned
back on account of bad weather
conditions. Mr. Mitcham has lived
in and around Kendrick for nearly
a third of a century—to be exact—
thirty-two years last February. He
has always been a loyal Potlatcher
and has always kept Kendrick's in
terests in the foreground.
Next Friday, April 7, Mr. Mit
chem will be sixty-seven years old
and he is apparently good for at
least twelve more years of service
on the American ridge mail route.
He has done his work thoroughly,
as all the patrons on his route will
cheerfully testify.
He has kindly furnished the
Gazette with the following figures,
which will give a general idea of
the work he has accomplished. After
deducting Sundays and all legal
holidays, we find that he has carried
the mail three thousand six hundred
and eighty-four days. He has
traveled sixty-three thousand six
hundred and twenty-eight miles.
He has distributed and collected
five hundred and four thousand
pieces of mail and issued four thou
sand three hundred and twenty
money orders. This is certainly
some record and we hope Mr. Mit
cham will continue his route many
more years and increase the above
figures materially.
"Dust of the Earth"
The home talent play given last
Fridav night for the benefit of the
Presbyterian church was a pleasant
surprise for those present. The
audience was expecting something
good and their expectations were
much more than realized. The
twelve characters who made up the
caste, all did so well that it would
be hard to say who were the stars.
Miss Agnes Grice, however, handled
her part in such a delightfully
pleasing manner, that she is prob
ably deserving of special mention.
She certainly displayed unusual
talent.
Those who took part in the play
wish to thank Mrs. A. R. Shumaker
and Mrs. A. W. Patton for their
kind assistance.
The receipts for the evening
amounted to about thirtv-five
dollars and would have been much
more had the weather been favor
able.
Noted Speakers at Moscow
Attorney L. G. Peterson went to
Moscow Monday to attend a meet
ing of the Chamber of Commerce.
The Commercial Club of Kendrick
was invited to attend in a body but
was unable to accept the invitation,
for various reasons. Some of the
prominent speakers who took part
in the program were Governor
Alexander, Dr. Nicholas Murray
Butler, President of Columbia Uni
versity, President McVey of North
Dakota University and others.
Bought New Cars
Guy Lewis got in a shipment of
six Overland cars last week. They
were the center of interest for
several days. He sold three of
them soon after they arrived. Dr.
Rothwell purchased a roadster,
Model 75, 25 horsepower. E. P.
Atchison a Willys-Knight, 40 horse
power and Frank Roberts a Model
75 Tourist.
