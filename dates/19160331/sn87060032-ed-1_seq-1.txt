Washington, D. C
March 27. 1916.
TO THE PUBLIC:
I shall seek nrenominationand
reelection to Congress. As best
I could, I have submitted the
matter to the voters of the 11th
Congressional District. Many of
the leaders and the great bulk of
the rank and file of the Party,
say for me to run.
It is their contention, and in
that I fully agree, that I, along
with other Republican Members
of Congress, have been handi
capped by a Democratic Admin
istration ever since I have been
a member here. The next House
and the next National Adminis
tration will be Republican. I
would like to be given a real
chance to be of service to the
people of my district. It takes
time and experience to become an
efficient legislator. The leaders
of both Parties here have seen
long service. The real legislation
of Congress is done through its
committees usually done by peo
ple who don't make much noise
about it. The Chairman of the
various committees are largely!
responsible for the laws that are
enacted as well as the fate of
bills that fail to pass.
The next House will be Repub
lican, and, if I am reelected, ,1
will be the Chairman of the great
Committee on Education. I am
j3L now the the ranking Republican
?& Member of that Committee.
I believe, with my experience
here, that I can be of more ser
vice to the Republican Party and
the people of my district than a
Representative without the ex
perience and training which a
Member of Congress can acquire
only from long service.
The Republican voters in other
districts and States keep their
Members of Congress here. Rep
resentative Langley, for instance,
from the 10th (Ky.) District, has
been in Congress for ten years;
Austin, of Tennessee, eight years;
Slemp, of Virginia, ten years.
-Their districts all border on the
Elevenjth. They will all doubt
less be reelected. I do not be
lieve that it is the desire of the
people of my district to give me
only six years. If I thought so,
J. M. ROBSION,
President. Cashier.

I would not be a candidate.
The Democrats in Kentucky
reward the men who are most
vindictive against me and elect
them to office and keep them
there whenever they get a
chance.
Congressman Ben Johnson,
from the 4th Kentucky District,
has been in Congress ten years;
Ollie James was in Congress ten
years and then elected to the
United States Senate. A. 0.
Stanley was in Congress twelve
years and is now Governor of
Kentucky. Swager Sherley has
been in Congress fourteen years
and so the story goes.
The Democrats are not through
hounding me yet as the recent
attempt of the Kentucky Legis
lature to legislate me out of office,
along with other things, clearly
show.
While I am not seeking a re
nomination on this ground, still
I am frank to say that I want
the republicans of rhe Eleventh
Congressional District to keep
me in Congress at least as long
as the democrats kept me in jail.
And besides these things, my
friends have stood by me loyally
when I was not in a situation to
be of service to them. If the
republicans win, I will be. They
want me to run. I owe them a
debt of gratitude that nothing
but death or defeat will keep me
from paying. ,l
My hat is in the ring until the
fight is finished, if a fight there's
to be. ,
Again thanking my friends for
their devoted loyalty, and trust
ing that I may have the united
support of the Party this time,
I am,
Very Sincerely,
Caleb Powers.

Play Written by Barbour-
ville Woman, Rendered
by Students.
One of the most interesting
events in the history of Barbour
villo was the entertainment at
the High School last Friday eve
ning. The large chapel was
crowded to its utmost capacity,
attention of the audience was
held from the start. The pro
gram was in the form of a play,
and was highly appreciated by
all present. Mrs. H. M. Oldfield,
the talented wife of the principal
of the High School, deserves
much credit for the success of
the enterprise. She wrote the
play herself, painted the beauti
ful stage scenery, and trained
the students for the exercises.
The plan and composition of the
play gave evidence of the great
literary ability of the auther; the
raining was thorough, and the
c.uuion of the program high
ly pleasing to the audience. Our
town should not only be proud of
the way in which the young peo
ple performed on the stage, but
should also be exceedingly proud
of the fact that we have in our
midst, one who is able to produce
such a play. All who were pres
ent were highly delighted with
the evening's entertainment.
The object of the entertain
ment was mainly to secure funds
to aid in paying for the instru
ments used by the High School
band, and it is a matter of grati
fication to all that more than one
hundred dollars was taken in at
the door. There is some talk of
taking this play to some of our
neighboring towns, and it is to
be hoped that it will be done.
We like to share our good things
with others.
Great London Shows Has
Finest Turnout of Any.
The great London Shows Con
solidated, which comes to Bar-
bourville Monday, April 17, will
bring special importations in the
way of all kinds of new circus
acts which have been secured in
conjunction with a long string of
the pick of American performers.
Every department has been
increased extensively, and it is
claimed the exhibition of blooded
horses is the best ever offered,
among which are the wonderful
Dublin Gravs. the Big Six. who
have captured all of the prizes at'
the prominent horse shows. They(
are valued at $25, 000.
The parade, said to be "the
finest turnout of any circus has
ever made in any country," will
traverse the principal streets
morning of show day.
McDermott and
the Rnilvp- '.
i Some people are always in the t
way, but James A. McDermott'
takes the lead.
The Louisville & Nashville
Railroad is trying to get a right-of-way
to Rockhold through by
Wilton, so as to surround the hill
near Emanuel, and in order to do
so they had to go down Indian
Creek. McDermott says the sur-,
vey down that creek goes through
his cottage at Dishman Springs
and the company changed the!
route in order to miss him. So
they came back to Barbourvillo
and started another survey across
the North side of town and they
'find themselves splitting Jim's

residence near the brick plant,
in half. He says in order for the
company to build the road and
improve the community, he will
sacrifice his handsome brick res
idence on Allison avenue.
