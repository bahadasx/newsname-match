DARCY LEADS THEM

Les Darcy, the sensational Austra
lian middleweight, -won more fights in
1915 than any other fighter of promi
nence in the world. He had 13 bouts
and won 12. His only defeat was by
Jeff Smith; whom he heat twice later.
Darcy's victories included two knock
outs over Eddie McGoorty and a deci
sion over Jimmy Clabby, which gives
him a good claim to the middleweight
championship.

tories with ten, nine of which were
knockouts. He also boxed seven no

PREDICTS MORE SPEED
Great Runner Does Not Take
Pessimistic View of Outlook.
Believes That Within Year or Two Xn-
other Crop of Fast One Will Come
Along Dlstancers Show
Much Improvement
George V. Bonhag, probably the
greatest long-distance runner ever de
veloped on the American cinder path,
does not take a pessimistic view of
the present condition of the distance
game.
"I believe," he said, "that it Is pure
ly question of cycles. Just at pres
ent there is a lull, where a few years
ago we were turning out fast distance
men by the dozen. Probably within
a year or two another crop of fast
ones will come along. One thing is
certain, our dlstancers, as a class,
have improved marvelously in the last
decade.
"What we need now," continued
Ronhag, "Is a distance champion com
ii g from the ranks. He will take to
ru ining fast and set a standard. The
boys who will try to beat him will
gradually work up to that standard,
and when they have reached it the
real champion will move along to a
still faster level. I know it was that
way when I was coming along at my
best. The last year I was running
fast there were a dozen men who
could smother the performance I did
when I first won the two-mile cham
pionship. "Had Hannes Kohlemainen devel
oped In this country, running against
our dlstancers, the chances are that
he would have carried half a dozen ot
oi- men along with him, and as a re
sult we would have had just so many
George V. Bonhag.
runners capable of running closer to
him than we now have."
Bonhag saw Joie Ray, the sturdy
Chicagoan, run for the first timt at
the New York Athletic club games
and he was greatly struck with the
national mile champion's ability. "It
that boy ever learns to judge Lis pace
properly 4 minutes and 10 seconds will
be possible for him," was Bonhag's
comment Recently Ray ran his first
220 yards around 26 seconds, after
which he slowed down, finishing witt
a terrific quarter sprint at the end.
Percy la Harvard's Strong Man.
George A. Percy, the hockey star
who holds the Harvard university
strongest man honor, weighs only 160
pounds and is about five feet ten
inches tall. Percy won the honor by
his skill in chinning and dipping on
the parallel bars. Percy chinned him
self 31 times and dipped 61 times,
thereby registering a new record in
the college tor these feats. His tota'
points was 1,442.4.
To Facilitate Schedules.
An Intercollegiate association ot
graduate managers ot athletics la be

eastern universities, to facilitate the
arrangement of schedules. Among
those already members ot the organ

AWAIT ATTACK ON THE SUEZ
German-Turkish Forces Expected to
Plunge Toward Canal Veterans

for a Scrap.
Cairo. Egypt is waiting. It is wait
ing with the patience ot a country
ages old that can' afford to wait It Is
quite conscious of its position in the
war. It expects the German-Turkish
forces to plunge toward the Suez
canal, and it is ready for them. But
it awaita the event with an eastern
calm on which is superimposed a
British calm.
Here In Cairo I feel I am in closed
territory. After being raced across
the eastern Mediterranean in a P.
A O. liner with an honest fear of
submarines, I was dropped at Port
Said and there was an ordinary train,
dining car and all, which hustled
us on to Cairo, skirting the canal and
the desert which were not at all at
ordinary, Onca in Egypt I or anyone
can move about anywhere. It is easier
to knock about on the delta of the
Nile than In France or England.
Once you are off the delta the tri
angle with Cairo at the apex, you run
into military zones. The secretive
desert lies beyond and even the trains
of padded footed camels snooping oft
across the skyline, no doubt on quite
ordinary errands, and their Arab
drivers add to the mystery.
No Uprising Is Likely,
One can spend four and a half days
go'ng from Khartoum as easily as any
tourist ever traveled the Nile, but if
there Is one thing extremely unlikely
to happen in Egypt it is an uprising
between here and the Soudan; nor are
any of the desert tribes likely to cre
ate any havoc along the river. Trou
ble can come but from two directions,
east and west. Both are under active
military control and I am for the
present not permitted to write about
them.
But there Is enough going on In this
small, intensely vivid world to keep
one from getting restless. For, re
mote from the war as we are here, we
are In It In a strategic position, and
the part of Egypt which counts
strategically in a military sense is
really quite small. It is only three
hours from here to Alexandria and
five to Port Said. The situation has
dramatic compactness. Beyond that
there are only the considerable out
post forces at tho oases In the desert
Egypt is staged in Cairo. Cairo
has not given up any of its ordinary
lite, except the tourist trade, and Is
carrying off its military honors with
quite an air. It can afford to let the
tourists go, because it has the
Australians and they are worth more
in a month than the tdurists of ten
years.
Newt From the Senussl
I happen to be waiting for some
thing that lifts the curtain and re
veals a corner of the stage. A British
officer has located an Arab some

Bar Harbor, Me. Boys and men
who make a business of trapping and
hunting in this vicinity, and there are
many tu'ch, are all smiles over the re
sults of their winter's work.
Last year the bottom was knocked
out of the fur business by the Euro
pean war. Prices were very low, and
there was In consequence very little
trapping done. This caused a short
age of manufactured furs and also a
decided Increase in the number of
animals available this winter. Fur
bearing, animals, according to the
woodsmen, were never so plentiful in
this part of New England.
Time was when only a few kinds ot
animals were much sought for their
pelts. With the increased demand,
however, there it hardly anything
that wears fur, from the bear to the
mutkrat and rabbit whose skin it

report will mean much. I have seated
myself, as many thousands ot Ameri
cans have done, on the terrace of
Shepheard's hotel, but I have quite an
other sight from the usual one before
me.
Imagine the most European of
Cairo's streets filled from the steps
of the hotel to the arcade across the
way with swaggering men in khaki.
They walk with a swing and a
cheero," their apnri Jangling, the
Emu feathers In their hats waving,
their level eyes a head above even
the tall Egyptians. To anyone used
to the areas ot Europe they strike

by their virility. They seem fairly
to swell through the streets.

city bustling with the heroes of west

of money and Itching to spend it to
blow It in in a large and conspicuous
manner. They fill the sidewalks.

the bare legs of the sons of the
Prophet who wriggle among them keen
on baksheesh and offering to sell them
what they will.
The steps of the hotel are lined
with military police, soldiers wearing
tne reel ana white brassard of the
P. M.t guard. They are here every
night For that matter they are to
be found everywhere in Cairo to the
number of 1,500 to keep the same im
perial Australian private in order. But
tonight they are particularly vigilant,
as an order has been issued declaring
Shepheard's and the Continental ho
tels out of bounds for anyone under
tho rank of an officer. The order was
issued because the Australian privates
were monopolizing the two best places
in the town to dine.
Two of these Australian boys, lean
flanked horsemen from the plains,
free men in the very carriage of
their heads, started to mount the
stops. "Pull them up!" the lleuten
ant of the P. M.'s guard snapped out.
For a moment I thought we would
have a scene, but the two boys, who
had not heard the official order, Us
tened with faces as cold as marble,
and, without losing a trace of dig
nity, turned and walked down the
stairs. I wanted to cheer. The land
ing at Anzak was easier for them
than to walk down those stairs, but
they did It like cowboys and men.
"King's" Son a Private.
Most of these Australians have
plenty of money and there is no tell
ing by their rank how much money
they have. One private has reqted
the most expensive house for rent in
Cairo and has a retinue of servants.
He is the son of a pearl king.
The democracy of this army shocks
some British officers and delights
some others. Usually they like it, be
cause the type of British officer who
has been sent to Egypt is usually a
man who has knocked about the back
countries and values men for being
men. I spent the morning with a
British 'major who had received or
ders to work up a contingent to
handle a camel corps. For corps -captain
he picked up an Australian who
has not an "h" to hit name and

friend asks. He has been doing a
large share of his provisional recruit
ing sitting in a cafe, and the word has
passed around where he is to be
found. And this is the British army!
An Australian told me a story on
his colonel. They were fresh back
from Galllpoll, and ordered up for a

Longing for a Strap.
Three ot those mighty men from
the Antipodes were riding on a street
car with me the other day and three
dapper effendl, with polished boot
and more than polished manners, en
tered and tat down opposite.
One of the Australian leaned
across to me and remarked:
Stranger, cant you do something to
start a figbJtT I need exercise."
The effendl looked disturbed but
kept their seats.
The most typical of the stories I
have heard on passable authority oc
curred the night of the evacuation of
Ansae, the particular evacuation in
which the Australians did not lose a
man. Officers have told me that a

to which they had clung for months
they had not the slightest expecta
tion of ever getting away alive. They
hoped they might get some of their
men oft on the transports which bad
come up under cover ot night, but to
escape themselves they considered im
possible. That night, though everyone knew
what was going to happen, was
chosen by several mighty Australians
to get dead drunk. They could not be
moved. But In the dawn, hours after
everyone else was gone, they wok
from their drink Homerlcally, and
swam out until they were picked up.

On the sidewalk Immediately be
low the rail of the hotel, an Arab
woman 1 squatting telling the for
tunes of two Australians. A water
carrier, dirty beyond belief, pushes
along through the swarming porter.
Officers are arriving, bag and bag
gage, every half minute, and through
the 'red fezzes comes a brighter touch
of color as two British generals, red
bands on their caps, red tabs on their
lapela and strips of service ribbons
with every color in the rainbow, pull
up.
But through all this distracting
color comes a figure in a white turban,
and a white burnoose who dominates
the sidewalk. A staff officer who has
just descended the steps sees him and
thrusts out a hand for him to shake.
He gives it a quiet, dignified shake,
and they pass a few compliments be
fore they past on. It occurs to me
that this is the first time I have teen
an English officer shake hands with a
native and the explanation it being
expressed right behind me.
"A Bedouin," an officer is saying,

opposed to ending the life ot so use
