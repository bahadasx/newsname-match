GERMANY HAS
LITTLE NEWS
OF DISASTERS
Berlin Has No Information
on Subject From Gov

GERARD STILL SILENT
Result of Ambassador's In
quiries Mystery to Wash
ington Officials.
Berlin, March 2S, Tia London,
March 31, 1:25 p. m. (Delayed.)
Inquiries in government circles de
veloped the statement that noth
ing is known here concerning the
explosion which damaged the
cross channel steam?r Sussex be
yond the newspaper reports from
abroad. Officials are refraining
from comment in the absence of
definite information.
Washington, March 31. The situa
tion with Germany was described offi
cially as not being "imminent" and it
was said that the two committees had
not come to the state department by
appointment but had come separately
seeking information for the guidance
of members of congress.
Ordinary delay in communication
with Berlin was one reason advanced
for the failure to receive any response
from Ambassador Gerard. Officials ex
plained that It usually requires from
i 36 to 4S hours for a message to reach
Mr.' Gerard and about the same time
.for n- answer. .
American Ambassador Page at
London cabled the department today
that he was forwarding by mail addi
tional affidavits of Americans involved
in the Sussex disaster.
The situation may accurately be
described as a waiting one.
Aside from the slowness of com
munication between Washington and
Berlin it was pointed out today that
the American ambassador may not
have carried his request to the foreign
office while it was engaged in the del
icate situation in the German reich
stag over the submarine policy.
Chairman Stone said that no com
plications in the situation inspired his
call upon Secretary Lansing.
"The fact that Chairman Flood of
the house committee was also at the
department was a "mere coincidence,"
said he, explaining that he had gone
to the department only to secure any
additional information on' the situa
tion. Following today's cabinet meeting
officials said complete evidence had
not. been received in the cases of 'ph-
!sels carrying Americans attacked re
cently, that no action would be taken
by the American government until
such facts had been received and that
no action leading to serious conse
quences would be taken at all unless
conclusive evidence was established
that an attack had been made by a Ger
man submarine contrary to interna
tional law.

PRETTY WELL PATCHED
Brirish Ship
Captured by
Lone Pirate
Lewes, Del., March 31. The young
German who captured the British
steamer Matoppo and terrorized her
crew of 56 men on Wednesday night
shortly after the ship had sailed out
of New York harbor for Vladivostok
writh railroad., sup plies Jtcrjhe Russian
goverment, declared today that he was
a spy for the German government
Ernst Schiller, the prisoner, weary
from all the excitement he had under
gone sought sleep in the Lewes jail
early today.
"Yes, I am a spy for the German
government," he said. "You can be
lieve it or not it makes no difference
to me. I got my instructions from
the German government to go aboard
the ship and blow her up to prevent
her cargo from reaching Russia. I
could have blown her up but the
captain's plea for his wife and daugh
ter was too much for me and I
hadn't the heart to do it. I am ready
to take the consequences but I ask
that they keep me ashore instead of
sending me back to the ship for the
captain to take me in charge."
Schiller had been told that as his
daring exploit occurred outside the
three-mile limit, he would in all
liklihood be taken to British posses
sions in the West Indies for trial for
piracy. Federal authorities and rep
resentatives from the British govern
ment came here today to examine
Schiller and to decide what to do with
him.
An examination into Schiller's men
tal condition will be made.
Those who have talked with him
believe he is irresponsible and that his
story of his career is not true.
Schiller was reluctant to tell his
history. "I was born in Germany," he
said. "I was sent by the German gov
ernment to England soon after the
war started and at Germany's request
I enlisted in the British navy and was
assigned to the training ship Conway
at Liverpool. There are several thou
sand Germans in the British navy."
Captain Richard Bergner of the Ma
toppo, said he is convinced that Schil
ler is a former naval officer.

UP
TWO ARRESTED IN
PLOT; VON PAPEN
AGAIN INVOLVED
Washington, March 31. Department
of justice officials announced today
that two alleged conspirators with
Captain Hans Tauscher in the plot to
blow up the Welland canal were un
der arrest in New York, that a third
was under surveillance in-ew Eng
Iand, and that they expected to ar
rest a fourth in a few days.

the alleged German spy brought to

up the Welland canal was known to
Captain von Papen, the withdrawn
German military attache, who fur

him to do the work.
The additional arrests announced
today were of men in the party, offi
cials said, and had been made some
time ago, but kept under cover until
the investigation could be completed.
The first arrest wag made in New
York nearly a month ago, where the
prisoner, a German named Busse, is
new held secretly by department
agents. The second arrest was made
in El Paso about two weeks ago, a
man named Tucker. Busse is held
under a charge of conspiracy, officials
said, and Tucker is held as a material
witness. The third of Von der Goltz's
alleged accomplices is an Italian, of
ficials said, who has been under sur
veillance some time in New England
and can be arrested at any time. The
fourth is a German, Alfred A. Fritzen,
who was mentioned in the complaint
against Tauscher.
Fritzen, Busse and Von der Goltz
all were in the pay of Von Papen, de
partment agents said. Some of this
money was sent, Von der Goltz said,
while the men were awaiting their
chance to get across the international
line and dynamite the canal.

test feature eliminated, but in this
they were unsuccessful.
