GETTING A START
by
NATHAML. C. FOWLER, Ir.
(U h 19nS by the McClare Nwspaper Syadkicate
BE A MAN.
Man is made of Dust
Dust settles.
Be a man.
Settle! That is a good word with
which to conjure.
He who does not settle his accounts,
whether they are monetary or oth
erwise, is not manly and does not
stand well among men.
E+erybody is under obligation to i
somebody. He owes money or he
owes something beside money. He
cannot succeed, he cannot be true to
himself and to the world, unless he is
under obligations to somebody or to a
something, and unless others are un
der similar obligations to him.
Reciprocity is one of the first laws
of business and of every other depart- g
ment of life.
Alone, we amount to nothing. With
others there is no limit to our attain
ment h
Many a man pays his bills promptly tl
and forgets to keep his engagements. h
He is financially honest and socially
and otherwise dishonest.
An obligation is binding, no matter
how small it may be. a
If you agree to meet a man at a b
certain hour or upon a certain day, it
is just as. important that you keep p
this engagement as it is that you pay
your bills.
Nothing detracts more from one's
reputation than carelessness in keep- d
ing obligations, however small they d
may be.
Men of mark. men who rightly c
cupy high positions, never forget an
engagement, they are always on time,
and they consider themselves under
obligations to thos., with whom they
come in contact, in business and out
of it. Their word is as good as their
bond, and their bond is usually above =
par.
I do not and any excuse for profes
sional men who are forgetful and who
do not appear to realize the impor
tance of meeting every obligation and
of keeping every engagement. Some
of them may excuse themselves by t
claiming that their minds are preoc
cupied with other things. Sheer non- i
sense! The mind that cannot grasp
and surround and meet an obligation,
whether it belongs to a great scientist
or to a clerk behind the counter, is
not the kind of mind which is pro
destined .to succeed.
There is no excuse for failure to
meet an appointment or other obliga
tlen,or for delay in answering a let
ter which requires an immediate re
ply.
"I am too busy," is not an excuse.
You can trust a busy man, you can
depend upon him more than you can
upon a man who has nothing to do.
If I desired help, I should go to the
busiest man I know, for he has time.
The loafer hasn't.
At times it may be impossible for
you to do the work of the day during
the day; but, in the majority of cases,
each day's work can be performed
more easily today than it can be done
tomorrow.
Settle at the time of settlement.
Today is yours; tomorrow may not
be.
You are dependent upon your fel
low men. Treat them as you would
have them treat you, and realise that
they have equal rights with you; that
when you promise to do a thing, and
do not do it, you have stolen another
man's time and are just as much a
thief as you would be if you robbed
his money drawer.
Religion of the Future.
From President Eliot's "Religion of
the PFture" it appears that the "prog
rms of the nineteenth century far out
trtpped that of stmilar periods"--as
far perhaps as that of the last twenty
fve years has in turn outstripped it.
The "new ideas of God" which it has
produced give the basis for a new
twentieth century religion superior to
1 others. Some of these new ideas
are monotheim, immanence, God's
klove, the adoration (dalla, not latrla)
"tendeny toward progre." It rejects
polytheim, apotheosis, tribal religion,
sudden change of character, mediation,
dogma, mystery, amraments, the fall
at man, alienation from God and the
condemnation of the majority. It ab
rs the devil and will attack all his
works qaickly; it will teach that he is
best who loves best and serves best,
pad the greatest service will be to in
crease the stock of good will.
Male String.
Procure a few pieces of cotton
string each about ae sad one-half
feet lon, and lm them well with
soap. Prepare a brlne by dissolving
three tablesponfils of alt in a ucap
tul of water. Pasee the strings in
the brine and allow them to soak for
two hours or leagr. It ip mseessary

THE LISTENER.
Every man who does not know any-,
thing, and most men who do know
something, love to talk about what
they think they know, or do know.
The close-mouthed merchant, the
"yea, yea, nay, nay" sort of a fellow.
who uses his mind more than his
mouth, will, if encouraged, talk for
hours upon any subject in which he
is intensely interested. His head is
a storehouse of information, and, al
though it may have more entrances
than exits, he will open himself to
anyone who knows how to knock at
the door of his mind.
I have a friend who, although not
liberally educated, possesses more
general information to the square inch
than 99 per cent of educators have to
the square foot, and that is one hun
dred and forty-four to one. He ob
tained this knowledge largely because
he was a good listener and possessed
the ability to make others talk. If
he were riding on a train he would
select from among the passengers the
man who he thought was intelligent
and carried with him a heavy stock
of information. In a diplomatic way
he would discover the stranger's busl
pess or profession and the subject in
which he was the most interested.
He would turn the conversation in
that direction, asking an intelligent
question here and there, and showing
deep interest In the subject. fie sel
dom failed to obtain the desired re
sult. He met all classes of people,
from the classical student to the keep
er of a meat market, and from each
he drew a supply of information. much
of which, naturally, was valueless. He
had sense enough, however, to realize
that he could not expect to receive
valuable information alone; that he
must be content with chaff as well
as with wheat; but from each he drew
something worth while. The worth
while he remembered; the worthless
he forgot.
Conversation is, I believe, the best
medium for the obtaining of informa
tion. Everybody has something of his
own of which he is proud, and which
he is willing to distribute.
Bear in mind, however, that the
listener is only half a man. He must
give, if he would receive. He, there
fore, is not only a good listener, but
a good distributor. He exchanges
what he knows for what others know,
plays a game of mutual winning, giv
ing what he can afford to spare, and
taking from others what they are will
ing to distribute.
Social as well as business life is
based upon exchange.
Education does not conitst of receiv
ing and of not distributing.
If you give freely to others, they
will as freely give to you.
Conversation, rightly turned, leads
to profit, and is that kind of work
which is both recreation and business.
While you should give the prefer
ence to the acquiring of information
which is directly in your line, do not
confine your mental receipts to that
alone. Familiarity with general afl
fairs, even though many of them may
not be of direct benefit to you, broad
ends the mind and makes you better
able to use that part of the informa
tion received which is a part and par
eel of your livelihood-making.
Don't be afraid of knowing too
much.
Swift Backhander.
Mrs. Sam Tyle met her dearest
friend. Mrs. George Reen. in the
street.
"How lucky to meet you!" gushed
Mrs. 8. Tyle. "I'm-er-we want an
other maid; there is too much work
for two. So I'm looking for a parlor
maid."
Mrs. G. Reen hid her envy under a
smiling face.
"How strange," she gashed back.
"I think I know the very girl for you.
And I can recommend her personally,
because she is leaving us next week."
Mrs. Tyle darted a suspicious look
at her friend.
"But-er-why are you-er--getting
rid of her' 'she demanded.
Mrs. G. Reen smiled coolly.
"Oh, she's given me notice, dear!"
she said, with well-assured frank
ness. "You see, she complains that
there is too much silver to clean at
our house. So I know shell just suit
you!"
She'd Heard That Before.
Ananias went home to Sapphira the
