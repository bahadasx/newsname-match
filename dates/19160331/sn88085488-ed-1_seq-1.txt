SOUTH PALOUSE RIVER
CLAIMS LITTLE VICTIM
dale Tomsen, Four-. ear-Old 'lot,
Helicveed to Have Been Drowned
Friday Hotly Not Vet
Recovered
The South Palouse river claimed
its first victim near Pullman in many
years last Friday, when Gale Tom
sen, four-year-old son of Mrs. Matte
Tomsen, a widow woman, is thought
to have been drowned near the
Duthie building, in the north part of
town. While there were no eye wit
nesses to the drowning and the body
of the little boy has not yet been re
covered, all doubt that he whs
drowned has been dispelled and all
hope of finding him alive has been
abandoned. lie was last seen early
in the afternoon of Friday, playing
near the north branch of the South
Palouse in North Pullman, His
mother was away from home and
upon her return she started a search,
Not finding the little fellow she be
came alarmed and scores of Pullman
people dragged the river near where
he was last seen in .a vain attempt t<v
locate the body.
When he left home the hoy was
accompanied by his dog, his closed
companion, and the dog returned
home late in the afternoon. He
gave evidence of alarm and went to
the river, running out upon a plank
extending over the water and whin
ing, then running several rods down
the creek and returning to the plank.
The actions of the faithful canine
strengthened the theory that the boy
had fallen into the river and until
midnight, when daskness made
further efforts impossible, the river
was combed in an effort to locate the'
body.
Saturday morning the river had
become badly swollen by the rains,
making the search a difficult one.
but a number of college students re
sponded to the call of ,1. H. Mc-
Curdy, Y. M. C. A. secretary, and
manned an Improvised raft, dragging
the river for over a mile below the
scene of the accident. Citizens
joined in the search and through the
day and the following days it was
continued, but no trace of the body
has been found.
It Is feared that the high water of
Saturday may have carried the body
a considerable distance, possibly
leaving it buried in the mud. in
which case It may be several days be
fore it is recovered.
Mrs. Toinsen, the mother of tie
little boy has the sympathy of the
entire community in the sad affair.
She Is the mother of five children,
and is their sole sup].< it, earning a
living by working fo. -i number of
families. It was while she was away
from home on one of these missions
that the youngest son was lost, She
Is inconsolable in her deep sorrow,
and spent all of Sate-day night In
the rain along the banks of the river,
doping that she niigh; find the body
For several days Bha clung 'Mia

PULLMAN. WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, MARCH 31. 1916
HOLLAND'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS
CLEARLY OUTLINES HIS VIEWS
Insists that Vocatiana! Training Must be Re
inforced by the Teaching of the Human
ities and Liberal Arts.
Of the many able and forceful
iddresses delivered at the' inaugural
ixercises at the State College last
iveek, none made a deeper Imp res*
sion than the inaugural message of
Pres|dent Holland, In which he set
orth his conception of what the in
stitution should be and the scope of
is work, lie said:
"First of all, I desire to express
ny deep appreciation for the great
lonor conferred em me by the hoard
)f regents. Secondly, 1 want to thank
he citizens of Pullman and the state
if Washington for the warm wel
come they have given me. I am
ully aware of the fact that the task
have undertaken is a very respon
sible one', which will require my
nost. devoted thought and greatest
effort. I am encouraged to believe
hat 1 shall be able to help ill the
A'ork and purposes of this college
md in the welfare ami the progress
)f the state because I have received
rom the beginning, the encourage
nent and the guidance of Die faculty
md many evidences of support and
jood will on the part of the student
tody ami alumni. In assuming these
lew duties ami responsibilities 1 can
insure you I shall do my best."
Alter portraying the natural re
sources and economic conditions In
he state. President. Holland said:
"With this brief sketch of the geo
graphic ami economic conditions in
Washington, 1 can state my educa
ional thesis: Every Industrial actlv
ty in the state and the inland Em
lire in the Northwest, in fact, must
have its counterpart in this great
nstitution of higher learning. This
s the only way in which the physical
wealth and the economic and social
Ife can be developed, In a word,
Ol leges and universities, to be ef
'lclent, must function in the lives of
he people. When the resources and
ictivities of a state are diverse, then
In- institutions of higher learning
nust diversify. The greatest inven
ion of modern times is the utiliza
ion of natural things and natural
aws in the- education of man for the
hings he is to do.
"Under the Morrill ait and other
lational legislation, and under vari
jus state laws. Washington State
College is dedicated to the training
if young men and women for the in
lustrial activities of life, and this
irime function and laudable purpose
must not he lost sight of for an in
fant. The land grant college is to
each 'such branches of learning as
ire related to agriculture and the
mechanic arts * * * in order to
promote the liberal and practical
education of the industrial classes in
.he several pursuits and professions
>f life.'
"Some laymen unfortunately con
use the purposes of such a college
with that of a trade school. They
would have agriculture taught by
-ule-of-thumh. Such a type of in
struction would be disastrous,
jraduates in the agricultural work
ruder such a regime would go out
;o follow their professions with no
ibility to solve the problems of soils
md crops and plant and animal dis
eases, and no capacity to make the
tecessary readjustments which the
•hanging physical conditions require.
If we confined ourselves to purely
implrlcal teachings, the agricultural
interests of the estate would soon
anguish and die.
"Once in a while a layman even
contends that the departments of
•hemistry, botany, zoology, geology
md physics have no place in the
training of agriculturists; that the
Mire sciences should be abolished or
jreatly reduced. These persons do
rot realize that many of the most
langerous foes of the farmer are de
stroyed only through the study and
experimentation of men in the pure
science division of the college. The
Mirk of the Experiment Station here
it the State College, the one at Puy
illup, west of the Cascades, at Lind,
it Grand view, and at Waterville
______ «,
would be reduced in efficiency if
they did not have research men em
ployed in their projects. Deprived
of the best that pure science has to
offer, they would be hopeless and
helpless and worthless.
"Furthermore, the broad and help
ful work of the Extension Depart
ment, reaching household and farm
alike, would soon lose its value to
the state, if the lectures and demon
strators did not have the guidance
of the best scientists we can obtain
for our laboratories.
"Now 1 have come to the lasl
phase of my thesis. Some persons
contend that an institution of this
character does not have a place for
the "humanities," and thai the so
called "liberal arts'' course' should be
abolished. I have held this question j
to the' last because it needs some
what detailed treatment, l want to
repeat that, in my opinion, the mult,
function of this institution is to tram
men and women in the industrial vo
cations, such as agriculture, the me
chanic arts, veterinary science and
home economics. That indeed, is
the purpose, but a still larger pur
pose, to he found in all education
and as a basis for our democracy,
must, not be Ignored,
"Naturally our Institutions of
higher learning must send out effi
cient workers, men and women who
can accept Important positions In the
various vocations and professions
and fill them with credit and suc
cess.
"The mere training for a vocation
must always be supplemented and
reinforced by sufficient acquaint
a.' ceship with the liberal arts as to
insure an understanding and appre
ciation of the accomplishments and
the heritage of the human race In
its struggle toward enlightenment
and freedom. No man or woman
should be graduated from an Amer
lean college or university until he
has an understanding of the common
ideals which are the basis of our
democratic government, and there
fore, is able to take a responsible
position in the world's activities,
both as a worker and as a citizen.
"There should be in every school
of science and technology a strong
faculty teaching the humanities—
English literature, history, econom
ics, the foreign languages. Without
such a faculty the students would be
robbed of much of their heritage
and prevented from taking their
rightful places as educated citizens
in the practical world of affairs.
College graduates should be Inter
ested, vitally interested, in the com
munity—its religious life, its schools,
its local government, and in all
things looking toward the upbuild
ing of the community and the state.
"What place should a knowledge
and appreciation of music and art
have in the life of American men and
women? These subjects are taught
in the common schools on the as
sumption that they are part of the
social heritage of rich and poor aliki,
and make for human happiness and
appreciation. As music is looked up
on as part of the life of every com
munity and art enters into the con
struction of the cottage and the
beautlfication of the surroundings
and is an element in every article of
the home, one can understand that
these subjects have a place in every
institution of higher learning. A
farmer, a veterinarian, an engineer,
a teacher, or a housekeeper has as
much need to find inspiration in
music and arts as has the doctor, the
lawyer or the merchant.
"Physical education is also an Im
portant and essential part of a
college or university education.
Clean, manly Intercollegiate ath
letics should be encouraged, for they
are worth while, but they should not
overshadow or subordinate the train
ing that should be given to all the
students, and especially to those who
are in need of physical upbuilding.
