Shii Antouio, Tex., March 31. Amer-
i an troops have clashed with the
A llllstas, it is reported.
After th hardest kind of marching
the Americans located Villa along the
nil road south of Guerrero and fired
upon a portion of his force which was
reported to be large in numbers.
According to Gen. Funston, reports
which he believe to be thoroughly re
liable but the source of which he re
fused to name, the Carrauzlstas are
now co-operating with the Americana
in a supreme effort to make Villa
abandon his headlong flight and
itii'Ve n stand and fight.
Fmiston said his reports stated that
Vil'a had been Rtroiigly reinforced but
FunMon was confident that our men

who is no at the front, will be able
to taks cars of themselves isolated

WILL VOTE
ON MOTOR
EQUIPMENT
Chief Catlis Corrects Impression that Bond
Issue for Improving Fire Department
is Contemplated; Amount Sought
is $10,000 ,
At the election on Tuesday of next
week, the voters will be called upon,
in addition to electing aldermen, to
say whether or not the city of Chicka
sha shall contract a debt in the sum
of $10,'XH for the purpose of motoriz
ing and adding to the equipment o
the fire department.
Chief Gattis, of the fire department,
stated this morning that many of tlw
voters had through some means gain
ed an erroneous idea of this matter,
thinning that the election was for the
purpose of voting bonds with which
to raisfl tho money to add to the
equipment and to purchase the motor
trucks. Such, tho chief stated, was
not the case. The voters of the city
will be called upon to say whether or
rot the cltv shall buy the supplies, to
the -amount of $10,000 and pay for
them out of the proper funds.
City Clerk Reynolds stated that,
should the vote authorize the incurr
ing of the debt, there would be approx
imately $1,000 or $ ,0O0, almost If not
half the entire amount, available by
the time th3 equipment arrives to pay
down upon it.
In speaking further upon the matter.
Chief Gattis said that, should the
equipment of the fire department re
main as It is. It will become necessary
at once to purchase at least one and
possibly two teams of horses to sup
plant thoso which have outlived their
ruefulness as fire horses. On the
other hand, tho chief stated, with the
motorizi'is of the department two
teams of thosa now In use may be dis
posed with, thereby materially reduc
ing the Initial cost of the new equip
ment. MAYOR TO

STUDENTS
SAY SECY
IS NEEDED
Girls Tell Why Trained Worker is Requir
ed to Make Y. W. C. A. Successful
as Social Service Adjunct to
Oklahoma College for Women
"Do you need a Y. Wr. C. A. student
secretary?" This question, asked of
a number of young women who an
attending the O. C. W., brought forth
hut one reply, "yes," and thejf were
very emphatic in their answers. The
students are now engaged in a cam
pi ign to raise funds to pay the salary
of a trained worker who will devote
l.er entire time to promoting tho Y. W,
C. A. work. Some of them expressed
their view on the subject as follows:
"We need a YVW. C. A. student sec
retary at O. C. W. first of all, because
his is not a denominational school
and no church in in any way respon
sible for tho spiritual growth of the
Y, VV. C. A. here. We need some one
to keep a good, strong organization
Ming and a student secretary would
be competent in every way. A local
secretary, no matter how much her
heart might bo in the work, hasn't the
lime to devote to it.
"Therefore, a student secretary
would build up a successful Y. W. C.
A., create worlds of enthusiasm
among Its members, and keep it a
strong live organization." Miss Bess
Eurwell.
"A student secretary for any Y. V.
C. A. is, first of all, a "Booster," a girl
with "pep" enough to interest every
other girl in the Y. W. work, both so
cial and religious. Do we reed such
a person in O. C. W. next year? To
use a slang expression, 'well I shoujd
say we do.' No other form of our col-
lego activities needs encouragement
and support more than the Y. W. C.
A. There is, in every organization,
more or less work to be done. Some
one must be at the head of the order
to see that the work is carried on.
This duty should not fall on the presi
dent of tho Y. W. alone, because she
is herself a student and has much per.
sonal work; therefore, we must have
a student secretary. She can do f.ll
the hundred-and-one little things that
must be done that would otherwise
devolve upon the president. She car.
keep us in touch with outside happen
ings in' other like organizations, she
can attend to social service work here
in our own college, she can increase
the Y. W. membership, nnd, what is
far more important, she can devise
ways to mike Y. W. meetings attrac
tive." Etliia McCarty.
"O. C. V. does need and must have
a Y. W. C. A. secretary. AVe need her
for the following reasons: to bring
us new members, to waken up and in
terest tho old members, and to man
age the financial part.
"If we could have a Y. V. C. A. sec-
rotary, she would make everything
about the wor"i Interesting to an," the
programs would be delightful and
everyone werld w;nit to join. Sh?
would give each student something
definite to do and in thi-? way have
more a''t!v3 and "wtllinc-to-do'' mem
lers, SU3 would manage the finau-
cial side of tho organization and help
rnd shov us how to make money.
Flic would interest us in the great
( ni istian movement and would makh
our Ideals Htronger and higher. She
would help us to find our one purpose
lr life and would help make us into
hf'h minded, pure and cultivated
young woman. What need could bo
gieater?" Mary Thompson.
"A Y. W. C. A. student sscretary is
rendcd in the O. C. W. next year to
l-iing tho vork nearer to the workers
In ihat organization." The members
would understand and know more
pbout it they would become more in
terested and earnest workers. Tho
pirls would feel that they were more
a p"rt of the organization, and that
that part was localized and important
in itself." Mattio Hart.
UNCLE SAMi
WILL AID IN
MARKETING
Field Men Leave Washington to Start
. News Service; Will Collect and Re
. port Information in Regard to
Perishable Crops
Washhiijton, D. C, March 31. Field
men of the office of Markets and Ru
ral Organization have left Washing
ton to inaugurate the department of
agriculture's market news service for
perishable crops this year. Branch of
fices have boon established in New
York, Boston, Philadelphia, Buffalo,
Pittsbu'tch, Chicago, St. Louis, Min
neapolis and Kansas City, to collect
and distribute Information. In regard
to marketing conditions. Other men
are stationed in the producing sec
tions in Florida, Louisiana and Texas,
where oaions, tomatoes and strawber
ries are already being shipped lu car
load lots to tho big markets.
By collecting in this way informa
tion concerning conditions in produc
ing districts and marketing centers,
tho Market News Service of the de
partment of agriculture Is designed to
aid both shippers of and dealers in
perishable crops. The information
collected is sent out free by telegraph
to all those who are sufficiently inter
ested to pay the telegraph charges and
by mnil to those who do not care to in
cur this expense, but have a good rea
son for wishing the reports. Each of
the field men in the marketing and
producing centers acts as a distribu
tor of this information and. in addi
tion, it Is sent of direct from Wash
infton. ' These reports will deal with carload
shipments, receipts and general con
ditions for ,the onion, tomato and
strawberry crops. Other crops will
follow as the Beason advances, tho
service being designed to Include a
total of It", crops altogether. In the
opinion of marketing specialists this
work, which was begun last year, has
already demonstrated its value in pre
venting the glutting of markets, in se
curing more profitable distribution fo"
reritihable crops, and In avoiding de
lay and .vaste through unnecessary di
versions o' carload shipments en
