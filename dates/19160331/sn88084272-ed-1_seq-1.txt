TURKK foreigners were murdered at
or near Minaca, Chth , bv Villa,
according to a message received
by private individuals in El Taso Fri
day morning
One was Herman Blakenburg, an
American or German mining man, who
has been a mine foreman for various
companies in the Minaca district foi" a
number of jears The two other fer
elgners. whose names were not given
in the brief message, are believed to

Minaca is located on the Kansas

abort distance from La Junta, where
the Orient line forms a Junction with
the Chihuahua division of the afsxico

miles southeast of Guerrero, -where

the three foreigners was received here
in a private dispatch after it had been

Srandes, Mei , March 3D, by aero
plane to Columbus, X M, March 31
A scout returning to headquarters to
night from some point southeast of this
place reported that A'illa is rapidly re
treating eastward and is within approx
imately a abort distance of the city of
Chihuahua
American armv officers in close touch
with the situation refuse to discuss the
scout's elorj. though they also refuse
to discredit it The story has had its
effect, however, to arouse much specu
lation .as to the probable objective of
the fleeing bandit and his meager force
Those most familiar with the geogra
phy or the localit in which Villa is
said to be, are of the opinion that the
bandit chief is not so much Intent upon
reaching the cit of Chihuahua as he is
to get Into the fertile Concho valley,
where lie mav la in suppfies of food
and forage to maintain himself while
trying to etlect a Junction with some
of the chieftains of the southern portion
of tne republic, upon whom he can
rei fer support
Vlay Play for Chihuahua City.
It.nw.b. too; thai, he will pursue the
same tactics pursued by Salazar and
Campa, Who, after taking Juares at the
outbreak ot the revolution of 1912. and
starting louth, halted at Sauz and de-
monded that the then governor of the
state of Chihuahua, l'asiiual Oroxco,
Come to that point and outline to them
bis plan plan for turning the capital of
.the state ower lo Ihem
It is not believed he is In communi
cation with the present governor of
Chihuahua, nor is it believed possible
for Villa to repeat the Salasar-CamDa-
Orozcb cbup of I dirr j ears ago
Americans t lose lo A Ilia.
The scout who brought the store of
Villas whereabouts to the camp also
said tbe American forces in the field
wereiin close pursuit of the bandit and
in his opinion it would be a matter of
but a few ilnvs oi probablv hours before
thev would come up with him This,
too, was a matter which aimv officers
would not discuss
Gen Pershing commander of tin pu

trict but later in the day it was stated
by an American raining man that Bla

Blakenburg is said to have been
stronglv pro-German in his attitude to
ward the Buropean war and it is "a
question whether he is a German or an
American citizen Little is known of

here state that he has no known rela
