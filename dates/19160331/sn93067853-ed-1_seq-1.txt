HOSPITAL
HAS 1
Will Be Changed to
and Its Affairs Put
Basis?Special C
Adopted U
The annual meeting of the Union
Hospital association was held Thursday
night in the office of Dr. R. R.
Berry and at this meeting some very
radical changes were made in the organization.
Some months aero a sneo
ial committee consisting of Emslie
Nicholson, chairman, R. P. Morgan
and Lewis M. Rice, was appointed to
make a thorough investigation of the
situation and to report at the March
meetings, basing the recommendations
made upon such information as inquiry
brought.
The report of the committee was
adopted unanimously, and is as follows:
The annual meeting of the Union
Hospital association was held at the
office of Dr. R. R. Berry at 8 o'clock
p. jn., March 23, 1916, due notice having
been given all the members by
publication and in writing.
Mr. Allan Nicholson was elected
chairman of the meeting.
On motion put and carried, the
reading of the minutes of the last
meeting was dispensed with.
Neither the president nor treas-1
urer being present, no annual reports
were submitted by either of these gentlemen
:
The special committee, consisting of
Emslie Nicholson, R. P. Morgan and
L. M. Rice, appointed at the meeting
on January 7, 1916, to formulate a
plan and make recommendations for
the building of a hospital in Union*
made the following report:
TTT_ ' -" *
we, your committee appointed to
- make recommendations to the March
J I annual meeting of the Hospital assoHospital
be incorporated.
2. We recommend that the capital
stock be $16,000.
3. We further recommend that the
par value of each share be $100, (anybody
having paid less than $100 into
the present fund can secure a share
by paying the additional amount necessary
to bring the subscription up
to $100).
4. We recommend that due notice
be published of the change in the
form of organization and calling on
anybody not willing to allow their
subscription to stand, nor willing to
increase said subscription to $100,
that such parties call on the treasurer
within thirty days from time of published
notice for said money, or to be
thereafter barred.
5. If the foregoing recommendations
be adopted, we further suggest
that a committee of three be appointed
to secure a commission, and that
hooks of subscription be opened.
f). When a total of Ten Thousand
Dollars in subscriptions, including the
funds already in hand, be subscribed
in bona fide pledges, the incorporators
be then called together and an organization
perfected.
7. We further recommend that in
the operation of the hospital a committee
of ladies be appointed to take
charge of the conduct of the hospital
subject to the direction of the Board
of Directors of the corporation.
8. A committee of three be appointed
to draw up by-laws for the organization
is further recommended.
0. We further recommend that the
Hoard of Directors consist of not more
than five members chosen from trie
stockholders.
In conclusion, your committee begs
to say that we have made a thorough
investigation of the hospitals located
! ?lt (laffn^V- r.rnAnwnrttl u rwl I Qtnmne
and we have based our recommendations
largely upon the information
thus secured. Each of these institutions
is in a nature of a joint stock
company. They are located in about
the same size cities as Union. They
are each upon a paying basis and have
been from the start. The cost in each
case for hospital and equipment is
around Twenty Thousand Dollars."
Mr. Emslie Nicholson read the
above report as a whole and it was
then considered by paragraphs, each
of which was adopted unanimously,
and after all had been adopted, motion
was made, seconded and carried
that the report as a whole be adopted,
and this was unanimously done.
It was moved and carried that
Emslie Nicholson, Ft. P. Morgan and
I,. M. Rice be appointed to get the
charter and to open the books of subscription
for the new Hospital association
according to their recommendations.
The following resolution was made
by Mr, Emslie Nicholson and was

John G. Benson, of Brazil, Indiana,
who has organized a Sunday school of
4,000 active members, in a town of
,10,000 population, is to be an interesting

his Sunday school, which embraces A
nearly half the entire population of I
the town, is famous more for its ef- 1
ficienrv. even then fnr Jfc ol-,o Tl,? .
January number of the Ladies Home J
Journal devoted an entire page to pho- c
tographs of his school, designating it
as "The Big, Efficient Sunday School." '
The school has a men's Bible class of
over 700 members, and its cradle roll
includes 078 babies. How the school y
has been built up to this phenomenal
membership, and how every unit is j
kept actively at work under the ef- j
ficient system worked out, will be j
some of the interesting things Mr.
Benson will tell the Sunday school '
workers of South Carolina at Char
leston in May.
Although pressed with numerous re- "
quests for engagements, Mr. Benson
has written R. I). Webb, secretary of
the South Carolina association, that
he will accept the invitation to speak
in Charleston, and is willing to be
used wherever possible on the program.
Mr. Webb announces that he
will speak before all the sessions of
the convention and will take part in
the conferences.
The detailed program for the convention,
which is strictly an interdenominational
event, will be announced
in a few weeks. W. C. Pearce, of Chi- j

convention promises to be tht most
successful ever held, and it is confidently

5,000 schools of the State will he rep- '
resented. The Charleston people have
arranged for free entertainment for
a pastor, a superintendent and three
other delegates from each school. 1

tain Says Ship Und<
How Casual
London, March 2(5.?Although there
is still some uncertainty as to the
oss of life in the disaster to the crosschannel
steamer Sussex last Friday,
there no longer is any doubt that thi
deaths list is much larger than the
^arly advices indicated. The latest
figures compiled in London show a.many
as 102 persons missing, including
five Americans.
The Sussex had 430 persons aboard
[>f which the following have been accounted
for: Landed at Dover, 72
landed at Boulogne, 250; dead at Boulogne,
0; dead at Dover, 3.
The list of missing may be slightl>
diminished by the fact that some ol
the passengers who landed continue!
their journey without reporting theii
safety.
The casualties occurred in tw<
ways: First, in the explosion, wher
the ship was struck, and second, bj
drowning, when two life boats cap
sized.
Capt. Mouffett, together with sev
eral of the officers and a number ol
the passengers, asserts that the shij
undoubtedly was torpedoed. Most o
these witnesses declare they saw the
torpedo when it was a distance o
about 100 yards. Unfortunately thej
say there was not time enough t<
avoid it .although the captain made ai
attempt to save his vessel by a quid
manoeuvre.
Prevented Calls for Help.
The explosion killed or woundei
several men in the engine room an<
some occupants of the saloon directlj
above it. Injury to the wireless appa
