Field Notes from the Office
of the County Engineer
- The road drags are
busy
these days.
The state concrete bridge
0n
the "Old Trails High
way", four miles east of
Hoi brook, is now completed

The remaining work for
, the completion of the pier of
Flagstaff will celebrate.
Flagstaff Lodge N. 499, B.
P. 0. Elks, will handle the
Fourth qf July celebration in
Flagstaff this year.
Arrangements are not all
complete or the program
made up, but from the plan
on paper it looks as though
Flagstaff will have one of
the best celebrations
in its
history.
The cardinal principle of
Elkdom is patriotism and it
is especially fitting that they
should have charge of the
celebration of our Nation's
Birthday. All proceeds will
go toward building an Elk's
Home in Flagstaff.
