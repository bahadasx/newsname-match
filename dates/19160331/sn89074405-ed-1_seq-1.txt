FIRST ROBIN SPOTTED
BY JUSTICE PURCELL
SPRING SURELY HERE
The first robin of the year wm
spied this morning by City Justice
of the Peace R. J. I'urcell while on
his way to the office.
He saw the bird In a tree near
his home. 819 Chestnut street. The
judge thinks it sure was a sight for
sore eyes and final proof that spring
is here at lat*t to stay.
Some flocks of (lucks and geese,
northward bound, have also been
noticed during the pa»t few days
and this strengthens the belief that
better days are at hand.
Judge Parcel

seen Robin Red Breast tomorrow,'
which Is "April Fool's day," In
stead of today, lie would not have
been quite so consoled as to
weather prospects.
The weather man today rein
forces the belief that spring has ar
rived by saying that it will be "gen
erally fair tonight and Saturday
with little, change In temperature.

Three-sided Offensive Re
sults in French Retiring
From Village*
INFANTRY FIGHT
LASTS ALL NIGHT
Germans Fail to Retake Po
sition Lost in Avocourt
Wood.
Paris, March 31.—The Germans de
livered a fierce night attack on three
sides of the village of Malancourt,
says an official statement, and the
French retired from the village pro
per, which is in ruins, but continue
to hold the outskirts.
Lasted All Night.
Fierce infantry fighting lasted all
night before the French withdrew
from Malancourt. The Germans tried
again to retake the position won back
by the French in Avocourt Wood, but
I hey were repulsed. East of the
Meuse the night was calm.
Russian Offensive Important.
Petrograd, (via London) March
31.—The Russian offensive maneuvers
along the Dvinsk-Riga front, although
apparently local in character and un
important, as compared with more
sweeping spectacular movements that
have marked warfare on the eastern
front, have already rendered the
carefully constructed positions of
Field Marshal von Hindenburg less
secure and will, it is thought here,
determine the course of the coming
spring campaign.
The fighting now has developed
from' isolated encounters along a' ten
mile front, to a general engagement
extending more than thirty-five miles
along the lines.
German troops that were being
rushed to this front, instead of taking
part in an advance believed to have
been intended by the Germans, are
occupied In defending their positions
of last fall and it appears to observ
ers here that Field Marshal von Hin
denburg's spring campaign will be
defensive rather than the offensive
one that was expected.
Since the first blows struck by the
Russians along the northern sector,
the Russian situation has continually
improved and the heights which they
now command along the left bank of
the Dvina. and their successful opera
tions in the Riga district, are consid
ered a solid foundation for a further
advance as soon as the spring thaw is
over and the ground becomes firm.
Attention G. A. R.—Willis A. Gor
man post meets in regular session
Saturday evening at 7:30 o'clock.
Every comrade is urged to attend.
A. Knudson, commander A. .T. Pierce,
adjutant.
Twenty-eight persons were killed
and scores were injured in the Lake
Shore train wreck at Amherst, Ohio,
early Wednesday morning. These
pictures, showing the effects of the
disaster, were taken Wednesday fore
noon, before any of the debris had
baen eleared away..
The'wreck was one of those rarest
of railroad calamities—not one col
llsion, but two, Involving three trains,
on two tracks. When the half doaen
investigations now under way are
concluded, the blame will be. ifated on
