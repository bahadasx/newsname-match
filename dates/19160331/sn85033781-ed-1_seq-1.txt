HIGHS
ON SAME ROUTE
Great Dixie Highway and
Detroit to Chicago road
over one route through
Van Buren.
Supervisor E. J. Kirby of Covert was
in battle Creek last week to attend a
meeting of the officers and directors of
tbe "Detroit to Chicago Highway Asso
ciation," which was held at the Post
Tavern. Supervisor Kirby is one of the
strongest and most consistent "Good
Roads1' boosters in Van Buren county,
and he is always present at these meet
ings when It is possible to be there.
The meeting in question was for the
purpose of definitely fixing the route for
this great "Detroit to )bicHgo" highway.
There was some difference of opinion
among the officers of the association a?
to the route through Van Buren county.
It was finally settled however through
Dowagiac, Decatur, Hamilton, Paw I'
and on to Kalamazoo, over the establish
ed route of the great "Dixie Highway."
In the selection of this route, Van Buren
county seems to be especially favored,
for thus will two great National high
ways pass through the county and both
over the same route.

Last Saturday evening the Women's
Bible class of tbe Christian church

a token of their sincere good will. Kov.
Shape also read an original poem in
honor of B-o. Rowland's birthday. Mr.

OPPOSITION FOR
PAVING QUESTION
The question of paving Main street
came before the village council last Mon
day night. A remonstrance signed by
many of the business men on Main street
was presented to the council, and by
reason of this unexpected opposition the
question waa laid on the table for two
weeks. It is possible that some at least
who signed the remonntranoe, will with
draw their opposition when the matter
is fully understood, nd that the street
willjbe paved as originally planned.

ROADS.
The arteries of commerce
Are the highwas through our land.
They are endless in their windings,
Rach e'en India's coral strand;
They're the blazed trails that guide
'Cross earth's rough and rugged floors,
And the rond tht leads past my home
Is the one that passes yours.
Then why longer block life's tramways
With past methods, crude and old?
Why not vote the "County !Sstem?
Why not save our wasting gold
Why not lift "Old Dobbins' " burdens,
Speed tbe cht and clear the line,
For the road that passes your house
Is the one that leads to mine.
Voters, paste your seal of business
'Cross the dark scars of tbe past;
Let uh thread Van Buren county
With a highway that will last.
Let us smooth the bumps of transit
By our vote, spelled Y-e s;
Make the roads that pas9 Our house
Lead us through the wilderness.

WHOLE WEEK OF
FAMOUS PLAYS
Arthur Chatterdon with
noted theatrical comp
any comes to the Maj

Mr. Chatterdon and his popular or
ganization presents "The Fortune
Hunter" Sunday matinee and evening.
Comedies of every description have been
written and presented on the statre, and
have enjoyed a certain amount of publi
favor, but none have created the furore
credited to M The Fortune U unter'' which
took all New York by storm for the past
two seasons. It is whimsical and novel;
presenting pictures of real life ana char
acters that everybody knows. Monday

to be presented during the engagement
are The Temptation of Money, The
Oamblers, The Witching Hour, The
Traveling Salesman and Pierre of the

The Arthur Chatterdon Company in
cludes as strung a gathering of players
as can be secured. The leading lady

and Philadelphia. She is one of the

JUST CREDIT.
Do not fear to give credit
where credit is due. If we can
not do great deeds we can at
leaat appreciate them in others.
No jealous and envious spirit
oen rise to greatneee, whatever
opportunities are offered, and no
broad and generous spirit can
ever live an ignoble life, how
ever circumscribed its surround
inga. A whole lifetime of hum
drum dutiee cannot ao narrow
existence as doee the habit of
belittling the deeds and experi
ences of others.

MAPLE CITY CLUB.
The entertainment at iht Maple City
club last; Friday evening was certainly
a grand tinale to the winter series of
this popular club and brought to a close
one of the most enjoyable and success
ful years that the club has ever experi
enced in its history. As is always cus
tomary, one of the finest and best
cooked dinners was served at 6:30. Be
ing so near Easter time the decorations
suitable for this occasion were used.
Potted ferns were used as center pieces
and newly hatched chicks were seen
wandering around the tables. It was
all most artistic and very dainty.
After dinner the remainder of the
evening was spent in dancing, cards and
social chat. The members were nearly
all present and each and everyone never
felt better, and consequently entered
with great enthusiasm into the evening's
enjoyment. The committee that had
the evening in charge was composed of
Messrs. and Mesdames W. A. Simkins,
Fred Schunemao, A. O. Dunoombe,
Sylvester Kenyon, Charles Young, Sr.,
i and Howard Parks. It was an ideal so
j cial gathering and fully appreciated kby
I tbe large number present.
It was decided to hold a pot luck sup
per for the club members and their
families Friday evening, April 7. It
seems to be with a great deal of reluc
tance that the club adjourns for its
summer vacation, as the past year has
proved a most enjoyable one.
