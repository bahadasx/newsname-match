Lewes. Del., March -,.-A tall blond
haired young German giving his name
as Ernest Schiller is in the lockup here
tonight charged with piracy for having
captured a British ship with a crew of
fifty-six men single-handed on the high
seas.
Schiller stowed away on the British
steamship Matopho in Hoboken and
crawled out of the lifeboat at b o'clock
last night after the steamship had
cleared Sandy Hook lightship. With two
ugly looking revolver". Schiller made his
way to the cabin of Capt. Richard Berg

wireless station and rounded up the two

two operators to the captain's quarters.
and sent for the second engineer, to
whom lie issued instructions to keep the
vessel on its course during the night.
That he fnnally was captured and his
plans w-re frustrated. Schiller blames on
"four pals in Hoboken who backed out
and left me alone to go ahead without
them."
'Wftt the 'ileond engine~er, 5.chill r
also sent out word tr- fie other offi
cera and the crewr not to attempt to
rescue the captain under penalty of
certain geath for his prisoners and
all hands on board. Schiller told See

Schller's good humor, because lie had
mined the vessel and loaded its cargo
w ith bombs, which lie could explode
at any moment he saw fit.
Crew Obeys His Orders.
"The life of every man of thi ship
depends on absolute obedience to my
orders, Schiller told his captives.
"See that they are carried out to the
letter if you value your life. If you
do as I tell you I shall endeavor to
save you all, and destroy the ship
without loss of life."
Ouring the whole night the British
crew obeyed Schiller blindly, and
headed the vessel down the coast as
their captor commanded, after he
had ransacked the boat 'for papers.

In the morning Schiller went on

lie had assured himself that the cargo,
after all, was not such bad contra

smuggled himself on board, and that

about his wife and children in Eng- I

5Wciau to The washlast= eril.
New York- March 30-The frightful ner
vous strain induced by having 39.000 in
large bills suddenly and unexpected
thrust into one's unwilling fingers, was
described to District Attorney Sawn to
night by Eugene Oliver Kane, expert em
balmer.
This happened, Kane admits, on March
N. when Arthur Warren Waite. know
ing that detectives were trailing him.
and seeing visions in sleepless nights of
the electric chair, was imploring Kane
to supply the district attorney with a
sample of embalming fluid containing
arsenic, and so deceive theauthorities
as to the cause of John 1. Peck's
death.
It was Waite alone, Kane mid, who
formulated a plot to deceive JustUes
Waite still driven by the bad man of
Egypt. Every suggest in to falsify the
embalming fluid came from Waite.
Kane merely listened. saying neither no
nor yes to any of the dentist's argu
ments, or pleas, but sure in his own
mind, lie told Judge Swann, that he
would never get himself into trouble by
such a stupid trick. -
Gave Him Roll of Ills.
He led Waite along, so Lo pgeWfr.

insistence, to meet Waite at a cigar stofe
in Fifty-ninth street near Ninth avenue.
And then Waite appeared, out of breath.
hair on end, eyes wild with excitement.
thrusting at Kane a roll of bills.
"For God's sake get that stuff in the
embalming fluid and get a sample
down to the district attorney," Waite
whispered.
"And I'll tell you, judge," Kane con
tinued. "I was so flustered, and so
scared, that I didn't know what I was
doing. Im not used to having young
fortunes crammed into my finger-. It
flustered me, and before I could shove
the money back at Waite lie was out
and gone."
There was much more of the sarre
purport-all revealing Kane as a stu
dent of psychology, and entirely inno
cent of wrongdoing, or even thought
of wrongdoing. The whole story, in
Judge Swann's opinion, will bear
heavily against Waite when the den
tist goes on trial for the murder by
poison of his father-in-law, Mr.
Peck.
The cash received from Dr. Waits
will be surrendered to the district at
torney tomorrow by Kane. After the
emblamer had finished his direct
statement tonight he was permitted to
go home on the assurartce.of his law
yer that he would return to the Crim
inal Courts Building tomorrow for
further questioning.
says He Buried Cash.
Tomorrow morning he promises to
lead Assistant District Attorney John
T. Doeling to the spot where he hid
the cash. He hinted today that he
had buried the $11,000 roll near Grecn
port, Long Island. where he was on
Tuesday and Wednesday nights. but
Mr. Dooling was inclind to thiik that
the money was not far from Kane's
home in West Fifty-seventh ctreet.
Kane's appearance at the district
attorney's office this afternoon was
unexpecteld. While no order for his ar
rest had been issued, he was, never
theless, being diligently sought on
the general theory formed by Judge
Swann, that a material witness ruam
ing loose with $9,000 in his pocket
ought to be pretty carefully tabbed.
Kane managed to keep out of the

over the expected veto of President

Many members declared the vote
indicated almost exactly what the
vote would be if President Wilson fol

literacy test itself was shown by a
roll call forced by Representative
Sabath, of Illinois. who presented a
motion to recommit the bill to the
immigration committee with instruc

provision. On this vote the literacy
test was susained, 107 to 284.
The literacy test included in the
bill as passed would exclude from
admission to the United States three
months after the approval of the act:
"All aliens, over 16 years of age.
physically capable of reading, who
cannot read thse English language, or
some other language or dialect, in

The provision would direct the Sec
