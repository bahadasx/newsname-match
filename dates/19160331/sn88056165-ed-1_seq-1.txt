BUILD ROAD
INTO TIMBER
Milwaukee Road will Extend
Elk River Branch into the
White Pine Belt of Clear
water County.
Spokane, March 23.—"We are
contemplating an extension of
the Elk River branch in Idaho,
25 to 30 miles into the white pine
district," said President A. J.
Earling of the Chicago, Milwau
kee & St. Paul railway, on his
arrival here tonight from the
Pacific coast on his way east.
"We do not contemplate build
ing into the Pine creek region of
the Coeur d'Alenes, nor through
Fourth of July canyon this sea
son," he continued, "nor to
Northport, Wash."
The above announcement shows
the intention of the Milwaukee
road to serve the white pine belt
of the Clearwater district. Elk
River is located on the stream of
the same name about 12 miles
from the North Fork at Dent.
The construction of 25 or 30 miles
from Elk River would extend the
Milwaukee to a point on the
North Fork about Big Island or
the mouth of Roads creek. To
reach the Weippe plateau or any
district suitable for milling opera
tions would require more than
doubl j the construction suggested
by the Milwaukee president,
which would leave the infer
ence that the road is to be con
structed into the white pine dis
trict to haul the logs to Elk River
and Potlatch to be manufactured.
For the past two years there
has been much talk of the Mil
waukee being extended from Elk
River to the white pine district
of the Clearwater basin and it
has also been stated that when
this line is constrcted it would be
to haul the logs out of the Clear
water valley to be manufactured.
Persons interested in the Clear
water timber and the benefits the
entire valley should receive from
the development of the lumber
industry, have realized that some
action should be taken to en
courage the Northern Pacific to
build from its Clearwater line in
to the districts where lumber
activity is promised.
The Scofield interests have
been preparing at Weippe for the
past year to begin milling opera
tions on an extensive scale.
Large quantities of logs are cut,
the mill site is cleared and the
lake for storage purposes has
been created by dam construc
tion. The company has been ne
gotiating for the past year for a
Northern Pacific branch up Fords
creek.
Timber men have held the
view that the Northern Pacific
would not allow the Milwaukee
to enter the Clearwater timber
d strict without taking the neces
sary action to protect its interests
and this would mean the
Northern Pacific will not longer
hesitate in the matter of provid
ing transportation for the dis
tricts where interests are in
readiness to provide a lumber
tonnage.—Tribune.
Mrs. J. H. Welte has been on
the sick list this week.
Barney Seubert was the victim
of some more bad luck yesterday
when a horse he was riding fell
with him, sp aining one of his
wrists quite badly, straining his
back and shoulder and raking a
large patch of recently acid
burned cuticle from his face. We
would suggest that Barney take
out an accident policy and be pre
pared for the next event of this
pâture.

Great Results In Field Peas.
Star Mirror: That eighty acres
of land near Fairfield, Washing
ton, seeded one year to peas and
the following to wheat, yielded
$3456 more in the two years than
did an exactly similar eighty
acre field summer followed one
year and cropped to wheat the
next is stated bÿ J. R. Shinn for
merly connected with the agricul
tural department of the univer
sity who is now agriculturist for
the Spokane county.
Following summer fallowing
cultivation the wheat yield aver
aged 26 bushel to the acre, where
as in the same year the other
field cropped in peas the pre
ceeding season, yielding an aver
age of 35 bushels to the acre.
The crop which followed peas
sold for $567 more than that from
the other field, but the pea crop,
which averaged 20 bushels to the
acre, brought $640 more than the
better of the wheat crops. Peas
proved to be better than wheat
as a money making crop.
Mr. Shinn has pointed out that
in only three of the great coun
ties of Washington, half a million
acres of land lie idle each year as
a result of the summer fallowing
method of cultivation. It means
millions of dollars of loss to the
communities. Crop rotation
yields not only a cash return but
increased income from the wheat
crops when leguminous crops are
used in the rotation.
Peas have been found to be
successful because they get their
growth before the dry season be
ginning in July.
Farmers Drag Roads to Town.
John Wasem and L. H. Fortin
started out from their farms east
of town Monday morning with
their road drags and got so in
terested in their work that the
first thing they knew they were
dragging up the center of
Main street in Cottonwood and
their work proved so good that
they were made guests of the
commercial club at luncheon.
John afterward stated that the
roads out their way were so good
they could not find much that
needed dragging and so came on
to town where they could find
some real work to do. Be this
as it may, the fact remains that
the continued dragging of the
roads out on the prairie is rapidly
getting them into fine condition
and in many places they are al
ready in as fine shape as in the
middle of the summer while the
ground in the adjoining fields is
so wet that spring work cannot
be started for several days yet.
Road dragging pays big divi
dends. Even the scoffers are
coming to realize this fact, and
the drag alone is making good
roads in many places where the
grader and scraper are unknown.
There are several miles of road
in and around Cottonwood that
will «till stand quite a lot of drag
ging before assuming the shape
of boulevards.

MAY START A
CREAMERY
Seattle Man Looks Over the
Field and will Return With
in a Few Weeks to Begin
Active Campaign.
J. W. Quinn, a representative
of the Northwest Creamery Sup
ply Co. of Seattle, spent several
days in the city this week look
ing over the local situation with
a view to attempt the organiza
tion of a co-operative creamery
here. After conferring with a
number of business men of the
city he accepted their decision
that the present condition of the
roads would militate against the
work at this time and left this
morning for other points but in
tends returning within a few
weeks, or just as soon as the roads
get in proper condition, when'he
will spend several weeks here
working with local parties in get
ting a creamery established at
this place.
Creamery has been talked here
to a considerable extent for sever
al years but now that silos are
being built by our farmers and
have proven a success, and with
better dairy stock being intro
duced, there is every reason for
thinking that the time has at last
arrived for the organization of a
creamery. It is true, the large
grain farmer and the man in
tensely interested in the raising
of beef cattle or hogs cannot be
expected to take much interest in
a creamery, but the farmer of
160 acres or less and the man on
a timber ranch or the large farm,
w.io has plenty of assistance,
can and should be interested in the
establishment of a creamery and
should give it every possible sup
port and encouragemet, for it
means better prices and a steady
market for their cream, a monthly
pay-check with which to meet the
running expenses of their homes,
and eventually a nice bunch of
good dairy cows on every small
farm and certain prosperity for
every small farmer who engages
in the business and gives it the
attention it deserves.
County Has Much Timber.
It is estimated that Clearwater
county contains twenty billion
feet of good merchantable saw
timber, which will some day be
manufactured into lumber and
sent out to the various markets.
The amount is simply enormous,
really beyond comprehension.
Ten thousand feet of lumber will
build an ordinary 5-room house
and finish it up, with enough
scraps and pieces for sidewalks.
If the estimate of timber in the
county is correct, and we have
no reason to dispute it, there
would be enough lumber if man
ufactured to build two million
houses, and figuring it as Uncle
Sam does, five persons to the
house, would accomodate ten
million people. It would be pos
sible to rebuild every residence
in Washington, Idaho, Utah,
Oregon and Montana with lumber
from Clearwater county or should
the residences of New York,
Chicago, Philadelphia and San
Francisco be destroyed by fire or
other disaster, they could be re
built with the lumber from this
country.
Another comparison to enlight
en the skeptic mind: If Clear
water county's timber was sawed
and loaded on cars of 50,000 feet
each, it would require 500,000
cars to transport the lumber, or
20,000 trains of 25 care each and
if the trains were combined into
one it would be 554 miles long. —

Mrs. Puthoff Laid to Rest
The remains of the late Mrs.
Frank Puthoff were brought to
this city Saturday evening from
Spokane and were interred in
the local Catholic cemetery Mon
day morning, the funeral being
held from the Catholic church
and was quite largely attended.
Mary Magdalena Schmitt was
born at Mount Carmell, Iowa,
October 28th, 1875, and died at
the Sacred Heart hospital in
Spokane, Wash., March 23d,
1916. She moved with her par
ents to Salem, S. D., in 1882, and
on May 2, 1899, was married at
that place to Frank B. Puthoff.
In October, 1901, they moved to
Nezperce, Idaho, where they re
sided for seven years, then mov
ing to their farm north of this
place where they resided con
tinuously since that time. To
this union was born seven child
ren, three girls and four boys,
the eldest of whom is fifteen and
the youngest four years of age
and all of whom are still living.
The deceased was a devoted
wife and mother, a thorough
Christian and a neighbor who
was held in the highest esteem
by her many acquaintances. Be
sides her husband and children
she leaves three brothers, John
B. and Mathew Schmitt, of Leip
zig, Sask., Canada, and Joseph
Schmitt, of Nezperce, Idaho.
The remains of the deceased
lay in state at the Knop home in
this city until the time of the
funeral and were viewed by
many friends who desired to pay
respect to the deceased. The
funeral was one of the largest
held here for many months, thus
silently attesting to the univer
sal esteem in which the deceased
was held.
The Chronicle joins with the
many friends of the deceased in
extending deep sympathy^ the
heart broken husband and family
in their b reaverr.eat.
We desire to extend our deep
est thanks to the many friends
who assisted us during our recent
bereavement and to assure them
that their kind acts and words of
sympathy and comfort will never
be forgotten.

And Children,
Joseph Schmitt.
Prof. Wooster Pleased
Prof. Wooster, of the Lewiston
Normal school, who delivered a
lecture here last Friday evening
before the parent-teachers' as
sociation, spoke to as large an
audience as has been seen in Cot
tonwood for some time. Mr.
Wooster handled his subject in a
masterly manner and held the
close attention of his audience
for more than an hour. His re
marks were timely and well cho
sen and drew many compliment
ary expressions from those pres
ent. The musical program was
also thoroughly appreciated and
the association is to be compli
mented on providing such a
pleasing and instructive even
ing's entertainment.
Mrs. F. M. Lange is quite ill
this week with a severe attack of

W. J. Jordan is in town today
from Lewiston looking after busi
ness for the Northern Pacific.
Mr. Jordan recently returned
from a trip to the coast and
states that things are booming in
railroad circles and he looks for
a big year in lines of business.
War orders have made the east
ern states exceedingly prosper
ous for the past twelve months
or more and this prosperity is
just beginning to creep over the
Rockies and attack the Pacific
states.

Freight Train In A Wreck
The local freight train jumped
the track Tuesday moring just as
it was starting to descend the
Culdesac hill, about two miles
beyond Reubens, and tied up
traffic on the line until after mid
night. Ten loaded cars left the
rails and tore up the track for
several hundred feet before the
train could be brought to a stop.
Most of the derailed cars were
loaded with lumber, only one
containing hogs. Two emigrant
cars were in the train but these
did not leave the rails and no
one was hurt in the wreck. The
train crew and extra men sent
out from Lewiston worked all
day and most of the night in re
pairing the track and getting (he
care back onto the rails and it,
was after midnight before the
track was cleared. The passen
ger train was held at Culdesac
until the track was cleared and
did not get into this place until
four o'clock Wednesday morning.
The regular schedule was re-es
tablished that day and everything
has been progressing smoothly
since that time.
