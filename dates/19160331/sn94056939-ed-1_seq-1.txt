PETITION TO BE PRESENTED
TO COMMISSIONERS MONDAY
Ab wo go to presa tilla Issue,
toko pleasure iu anounclng to
world Hint Carrizozo is destined
we
tho
to
soon leave tho ranks of unincorpor
atlon and tako it-í rlRlitful placo
atnoiic tbo recognized and duly
incorporated towns ol Now Mexico
Our (itimiuncomont la justified by
the hearty reception which a pott
tlon. circulated by progressiva busl
ness men, has rocoivod at tho hands
of tho voters within tho proposed
cornorute'limttB of tho town
Currizozo. The final papers aro now
Ih procees of being drafted preparu
tory to presentation to tho Honor
nblo Hoard of County Commission
era of Lincoln County when they
convene to do business next Mótt
day morning.
There were a number of consider
ntiotm which demand tills move
without further procrostliiatio
Progressive citizens and wide awake
buHiuess men havoloug wanted
so' tho town assume the rnie n
Incorporation, but the benefits
accrue were either minimized
went unnoticed. But now that the
tittle city continues to spread itself
In suoli convincing persistence, new
business projects are being put
font, and the need of substantial
public works Is mado evident, oven
tho moat skeptical, when the ques
tiou was agitated some years ago
oro now its most ardent supporters
and they havo came tu realizo that
all that is worth while here can best
be festered by a systematic admin,
titration of local affairs under a
full incorporation,
Still a further possibility an ox
treme prob iblllty Is that to continue
unincorporated might eventually
handicap tho growth and propir
mnlntonanco of a standard high
school in Carrizozo. This assertion
la based on certain complaints made
by uu 13. P. f S V. attorney he
foro tho Stnto Tax Commission, at
its last meeting In Santa Fo and
while the attorney decided to ocreod
this timo to tho levy made, oeitaln
plans for local enlargement and
improvement iu school facilities woio
wiihotit doubt seriously impaired
by objection from this quarter. In
Short tho aspirations of loca!
tchool authorities had in be mater
tally altered by existing circum
stances. Tho objection was based
so'ely upon the fact that Carrizozo
was not an incorporated town and
that tho railroad company was pay
Ing taxes for tho higher education
ct tho youth of tho county at Capi
tán, all of which waa only loo trtld
To prevent the inevitable recurrence
of this objection, it behooves every
loyal citizen of this community to
register a vote for Incorporation on
election day. Watch for the date
(he commissioners shall designate
and do your duly by yourself and
your aeigubors.
if wo nro not greatly in error,
uarrizozo is uio oniy lown in mw.
. ... i . . A.
Mexico of anywhere neat its sizo
hlch is not Incorporated. Many
little burgs much smaller than this
place have realized certain benefits
to come to a tnwn of even a few
hundred from nu organized city
government. A commendable do-
mand upon this occassion of in:or
poratinn is a complete and full doso
of the thing, atid the papera pre.
sented for the consideration of the
Board of Commissioners specify
fully tho completo incorporation
sought tor Carrizozo lias never
done things by halves, and now
that this important milestone to
word, tho goal of progress Is soon to
bo paisod, let us plan and work
with an unprecedented cooperation
of a bigger and better Carrizozo.
THE INHUMAN BRUTE
A number of Carrizozo's most
valuablo doga havo fallen victims
to tho iro of some person whoso
identity is carefully concealed
coursa Thero are few dogs
Carrizozo without acknowledged
owners, and such a proceduro as
has beeu taken In getting revengo
against tho genus canls in general
is absolutely nothing short of cri
inlnullly the wanton destruction o
the rightful properly of anothe
and should ue ifnit witn ny due
process of law, all due efforts being
put forth to apprehend this low
llveu two-logger the sume as hiij
other flagrant violator of the law
o the land. Wo believe thatsucl
a person is low enough to destroy
human life In some such underhand
cd way, If occasion made It possl
ble to escape the clutches of h
law Thero are other ways to dis
patch underilrable canines wlthou
resorting to promiscuos slaughter
of all dogs who have an appetite
SCHOOL NOTES
Two of the very latest editions o
Webster's Unabridged Dictionaries,
with tho most approved typo
holders have been received this
week and promptly Installed as
part of I ho equipment of tho school
Tho High school department was
accorded one of the new reference
works while the other was installed
iu tho 7th and 8ih grade room.
If enthusiasm and consistent
practico count fur any tiling, tho
miiiistrel show which the high
school boys propuso, to offer to the
public next Fildoy night is going to
bo a leuord breaker for success
Many will remember tho hearty
roceptinu which the boys recolved
an n similar occasion three years
ago, und will ho interested to know
that this performance bids fair to
oxcel anything the boys have ever
staged. Soveral new songs, have
been introduce to swell the ranks
of mirth-proyokers,8o make your
plans to n'taud this performance
without fail.

Undorsherriff J. B. Baird and
brought to this place from W'.iite
Oaks to answor to the charge of
having stolen a quantity of tungs
ten oro from the Whlto Oaks Mines
Consolidated Company of tho latter
nl aco. The day previous H. H
Newbury had been a Carrizozo vlsi
tar to answer beforo Justico Mnssie
for a complantt relativa to this
charge of having spirited away th
valuable rock from tho possession
of its rightful possessors, but In
sufficient ovidenco was evinced by
tho trial to incriminate the prisoner
and ho was set at liberty In due
time. Upon Ills dismissal th
tilaintifts swore out a search war
rant to further probe the suspiolou
nature of tho case. Deputy Baird
was again put on the job and slcer
ed nis oar to mo Nomierry piece,
about a mile from White Oaks
nut his warrant into execution
We do not knuiv whether Mr, Unit
hat ever done any prospeoting, n
even has mining, proclivities, but h
certainly knows how to find III
nro, siice a careful search disclosed
ten sacks of high, grado tungsten
concealed beneath tho Door, valued
at $2000.

the ore In question were brought to

beforo Judgo Massie, entered a plea
of guilty and tils bond was lixed at

the county i all to await the action
of tho District Court regarding the

against l' . u. Newberry win came
up for trial hero tomorrow. Tho
Tho former was until recently iu
Mie employ of tho plaintiff, viz ,
tho White buks Mines Consolidated
Company, but had boon summarily

that ho had asilstance, other than

BELL'S STORE AGAIN
BURGLARIZED
Burglarizing tlio Stores of
Carrizozo Seems to be an
Easy Task for tho Thief
and of Frequent Occurence
HEY HELP THEMSELVES
AND WALK OUT UNMOLESTED
At an unknown hour last night a .
burglar entered the grocery store
of John E Bell, cffeatlng entronco
by breaking a pono of glass in a
rear window Having gained en
tronco into tho store, the bar which
holds tho roar door fast was easily
removed and the open dour.. made
llio res, of the depredation asimple
mailer for the intruder. Sume
twelve or ' fifteen dollars worth of
merchandise was taken and the
cash register rifled of somo three
dollars it contained. Officers were
July notified of the theft, but up to
the lime of going to press no one
Iiom beeu npprchondod of the crimo.
Mr Bell is positive, however it is
the work uf local' parlies, since per
fect familiarity with tho surround
ings has buen indicated.
Last week,s Outlook contained the
account of a burglary against this
business house, but entrance was
effected on this occasion by climb
ing o ver a, transom which -hud-been
ef' open ofiei scruhhhig 'i' fl r
just beforo closing. Evidently the
intrildor of last Hlght Was a Hryun
it u as lie went strong on giape juico
helping himself to some five bottles
of tho popular boverage
We feol sure that this outrage,
and the memory of others too num
erous to rwuition, will cause the
people of tills community to look
forward with genuine Miitlsfiici ion to
tho timo when Carrizozo will be
fully incorporated and systematic
provision mude for a competent
night watchman to protect tho in
terests of its merchants when thugs
und dead-beats uro úiiihejob, Be
at the pulls onelentlnn day and cast
your vole lor u stride toward i lie
goal of effective putrol of ourHtreets

bo leas blaring if not wholly eruJi
caled. TO GIVE MINSTREL

ii Little Ruin with Sunshine,"
"Can't Yo' Heah .We Oallin'?' Caro
line?", ondyouautn bugs get next to
that benzine buggy hit, "I. Didn't
Raise My Ford to be a Jiluey."
Como hoar you or your htlfetibor get

The prices ore popular, 23 and 35
cents. Remember liio date ond
