THE CITY ELECTION
S NEXT TUESDAY
Some Complications About
Ballot Not Yet Settled.
The annual spring election for may
or and members of the city council
will be held next Tuesday.
The regular democratic ticket as
headed by Hon. W. P. Merriam, and a
full complement of aldermen, it will
bo remembered is to be opposed by a
socialist ticket.
This latter ticket it will be remem
bered war. nominated by a so-called
mass meeting at the court house im
mediately after the democratic ward
primaries. It was- called as a "Cit
izens' Mass Convention," but wr.s in
reality dominated by the two or 1
leading socialists of the city. This
meeting named Dr. A. M. Steen as its
candidate for mayor. Dr. Steen re
fused the honor and notified City
Clerk Williams not to allow his name
to be printed on the ticket. Dr. Steen
stated that if he wanted to be mayor
he would seek he nomination in his
own party.
One or two others, candidates of
the mass meeting for Aldermen, noti
fied the city clerk not to plr.ee their
names on the ballot. Mr. Dodge, of
the Third ward, democrat, li-.s not so
notified the clerk.
But the poor clerk is puzzled; he
doesn't know what to do. The ticket
is made up as nominated by both the
democratic ward primaries, the demo
cratic city convention and the "Cit
izens' Mass (socialist) meeting. Da
spite the orders of candidates named
by the latter meeting to the contrary,
Clerk Williams says he will have to
print their names on the ticket, un
ions the city attorney advises hm not
to do so. The city attorney is in Jack
sonville trying an important case in
the U. S. Court, and may not get
here in time, so Clerk Williams is be
tween the devil and the dark, deep
sea. The tickets must be printed.
To Encourage Strawberry Culture.
T. E. Waldrup, Agricultural Field
Agent of the G. S. & F. R'y, has been
spending some time out in the west
ern part of the county, especially at
Springside, Bardin and Harlem seo
tions.awakening an interest among the
people in the question of strawberry
culture. Mr. Waldrup believes that
these sections contain much land pe-Il-l'i'iU'lx
adapted to the cultivation of
T i:awberries, and also that there is
an advantage of climate not enjoyed
bv Rime other sections further along
the line of his road which are now
engaged extensively in growing
strawberries.
He has appointed a meeting of far
mers of the communities named to
gather at Bardin, on Wednesday. May
d. when a plan of action will be
outlined.

SILL. SECTION NEAR
PALATKA1LY LINK
Missing in Continuous Hard
Road From Jacksonville
to Tampa.
President James R. Murphy of the
Florida Farms & Homes Inc., always
an enthusiastic apostle of hard roads
as a real builder-up of the communi
ties in which his company is heavily
interested, as well as in the state,
and who was one of the main pro
moters of the newly bonded piece of
road which is to connect Palatka with
Orange Springs, is more in earnest
now tha'n ever before to see the roads
already provided for in Putnam coun
ty pushed to an early finish.
Only last Wednesday he received
the letter which follows and which
tells its own tale. He wants this one
missing link supplied. Here is the
letter that has put a new stimulus
into this already well and nature stim
ulated hustler:
St. Petersburg, Fla.,
March 28th, 1916.
Jas. R. Murphy, President,
Florida Farms & Homes, Inc.,
Palatka, Florida.
My Dear Sir:
About twenty of our St. Petersburg
delegates have just returned from
the two Good Roads Conventions,
which were held at Ocala and St. Au
gustine last week, and we find that
there is now continuous hard road
from Jacksonville to the Tampa Bay
region except a little section in the
vicinity of Palatka. We were told
while at Palatka that they are to im
mediately pave with brick from there
to Hastings, and also that an oil-sand
road has been provided for from Pa
latka to Orange Springs, and we vvern
instructed to write you for further in
formation in regard to these two
roads and just when they would b
built, and as to whether they will
without doubt be completed by next
September or October. We have writ
ten to Mr. Rooney of Ocala about a
road from Ocala to Orange Springs,
and we think this can be arranged for
and if so, we will have a continuous
bard surfaced road from Jacksonville
to the Tampa Bay section, and it will
enable us to bring down the tens of
thousands of tourists who will want
to come next winter from the region?
of New York and New England, and
our Tfe'w' highway from Montreal to
Miami is now completed and in use
and there are thirty-two millions of
people along this route. We hope vou
will do all you can to get the two
nieces of road above mentioned in
Tutu am county finished by December.
Kindly let me hear from you prompt
ly as this matter is very important
to all Central and Gulf Coast Florida.
Yours very truly,
(Signed) Fred F. Smith.
"Good Roads" Smith.
Mr. Murphy is already busy doing
his full part.
Surprise For Rev. P. Q. Cason.
The ladies of the Baptist church
prepared a surprise shower for their
pastor, Rev. P. Q. Cason, last Thurs

evening, at the close of which ice
cream and cake were served.
Board of Trade Meeting.
The Palatka board of trade will
hold a meeting next Monday night at
which time a new president will be
elected.
It is important that there should bo
a large gathering of members on this
occasion, and if all who attended the
recent get-together banquet will show
the same spirit that was manifest at
that "feed" the hall will be full.
Be sure to attend. Let us make the
board a real force for the commercial
growth and development of Palatka.
It can be done by united action .
The Guevcheman Recital.
from expressions heard frim many
sources, the recital to be given this
evening by the famous Armenian ten
or, Badrig Guevcheman, in the Put
nam House, will bring out a full house
both to hear this talented singer and
to help in a small way to alleviate the
sufferings of his countrymen, the
persecuted Armenians, for which
cause a silver offering will be taken.
The public should turn out en masse
to hear this recital. The program
will begin at 8 o'clock and will be fu.l
of fine and pleasing numbers.
Miss Stallings Death.
Miss Mildred Claire Stallings,
daughter of City Engineer and Mrs.
S C Stallings, died at a little after
10 o'clock last Monday morning after
a long illness. ......
The funeral, under direction oi
Mooney & Davis, was held at the
house on Tuesday afternoon at 3, and

pastor of the Baptist church, and was
attended by a large gathering of
friends of the stricken family and
voung people, former companions of
the deceased. There were many flo
ral offerings. The interment was in
West View cemetery.
Miss Stallings had been in poor
health for a year or more She at
tended the high school until too ill to
continue her studies, and was exceed

SENATOR El HUDSON
iTO SPEAK SATURDAY
Night From Putnam
House Porch Is Guber
natorial Candidate.
Senator F. M. Hudson of Miami,
perhaps one of the most brilliant men
whp has ever sought the office of Gov
ernor of Florida, will address the cit
izens of Palatka from the Putnam
Ho,use porch next Saturday evening
immediately following the band con
cert. Prof. Chattaway has called the band
concert for 7:15 p. m., and this will
close at 8:15 or a few moments later.
Senator Hudson will speak immediate
ly after. Mayor Merriam has grant
ed the free use of the street in front
by the crowd that will surely assem
ble to hear this eloquent candidate.
This is the program of Senator
Hudson, but it is subject to change,
and if changed the people will be noti
fied by circular.
After Senator Hudson had made his
arrangements he learned that Hon.
Hon. Perry G. Wall of Tampa, candi
date for the U. S. Senate, had made
arrangements to speak in Palatka the
same night. Hon. F. A. Wood of St.
Petersburg, also a candidate for gov
ernor, who is in the city, states that
he is to speak with Mr. Wall. Mr.
Hudson says that he will try and ar
range a joint meeting, so that all the
candidates may be heard. If not suc
cessful of course Senator Hudson will
go on with his meeting as arranged.
Senator Hudson arrived in the city
on Wednesday evening tired out after
a long motor trip and several weeks
of constant speaking. He rested for
the night at the Putnam House and
spent the day yesterday meeting the
people in the city and on a trip with
Hon. W. G. Tilghman to Rodman in
the afternoon. He is going to see as
many Putnam county people as pos
sible. Senator Hudson is the present at
torney for the Florida Railroad Com
mission. He has served Dade county
in the senate through several sessions
and was president of that body. He
is known throughout the State and
enjoys (he respect of Florida's leading
men, who regard him as a well-balanced
conservative statesman and big
intellectually. Senator Hudson seems
to be growing in strength as a can
didate as he meets and gets acquaint
ed with the people, and as his popu
larity increases, so does his chance of
being Florida's next governor.
The Deal-Elliot Wedding.
The News is of course unable to
give a report of the Deal-Elliot wed
ding which was solemnized at Nash
viile, Ga., last evening, but the fol
lowing account of the plans which
were undoubtedly carried out will give
friends here a glimpse of the beauti
ful ceremony. It is taken from a
Valdosta paper of last week:
The marriage of Miss Harriet Deal
and Mr. James Martindale Elliot, of
Salisbury, Md., will be a brilliant
event occurring at Nashville, Ga.,
Thursday evening at 8:30 at the
Methodist church. Rev. M. A. Mor
gan, former pastor of the Methodist
church, cf this city, but now of Bain
bridge, will perform the ceremony.
Miss Deal will have as her matron
of honor, Mrs. Warner Hamm, of Pa
latka, Fla., a sister of the groom.
Miss Leona Roberts, who is at
present the guest of Miss Deal, will
be the maid of honor and the follow
ing young ladies will be bridesmaids:
Miss Lillian Clarke, of Gainesville,
Fla., Miss Margaret Roberts and Miss
Gi izella Merrill, of Palatka, Fla.
Mr. Charlie Phillips, of Palatka, will
be best man, and the groomsmen will
be Mr. Lex Grier, of Salisbury, Md.,
Ne'-h Tilghman, of Palatka, and Mr.
Willie Peoples, of Nashville, Ga.
Mr. Emory Gary and Mr. Arthur
Luke, of Nashville, will be ushers.
The ribbon girls will be Mary
Small, of this city, and Ruth Tygart,
Joeda Holland and Mildred Rigister,
of Nashville.
Kathleen Winn is to be the ring
bearer and Ruby Gaskins and Marie
and Marie Register, of Nashville, Ga.,
are to' be flower girls.
Miss Ruth Macon, of Nashville,
will play the wedding march, accom
panied by Miss Margaret Whitting-to-i
as violinist. Before the cere
mony Mrs. J. C. Smith, Miss Elsie
Higgs, Miss Willie May Sneed will
sing "Because God Made Thee Mine,"
and during the ceremony the musi
cians will play "Oh Beauteous Night,"
from "The Tales of Hoffman."
Miss Deal will be the honoree at a
round of parties before her marriage.
Among those already planned in her
honor are the following: Yester
day afternoon the Woman's Club, of
Nashville, gave the popular bride to
be a miscellaneous shower; Monday
evening Mrs. Lewis Mills will enter
tain at a dinner party; Tuesday af
ternoon Mrs. S. T. Tygart and Mrs.
D. L. Sheppard will give a miscella
neous shower; Wednesday Mrs. Ev
erett and Mrs. Harrison will give a
luncheon,' and after the rehearsal
Wednesday evening Mr. and Mrs. B.
A. Deal will entertain at a buffet sup
per. As Miss Deal formerly lived in Val
dosta and a number of her friends
here are to take part in her wedding
a large party of Valdostans are plan
ning to go over for Thursday evening.
The bride to be was unusually pop
ular with the young society set of
this city, and her friends throughout
south Georgia and Florida regret her
marriage is to take her so far from
her childhood home.
Which Do You Prefer?
It is important for reasons of health and
practical economy for every housekeeper
to ask herself this question:
" Do I prefer a pure baking powder like
Royal, made of cream of tartar derived from
grapes, or am I willing- to use a baking
powder made of alum or phosphate, both
derived from mineral sources ? "
The names of the ingredients printed
on the label show whether the kind you
are now using or any brandy new or old,
that -may be offered is a genuine cream
of tartar powder, or merely a phosphate
or alum compound.
Royal Baking Powder contains no alum
nor phosphate.

Some Few Shipments Have
Already Been Made.
Possibly the first new Irish pota
toes of the season to leave this sec
tion went forward from Federal Point
late last week, when a small shipment
sold f. o. b. at $8 the barrel.
This week G. W. Atkinson has con
signed a large shipment to New York.
It is understood that Mr. Atkinson
was offered $0.75 per barrel for his
potatoes, f. o. b., but refused. The
offer was made on potatoes which
rated as No. l's and 2's large and
small. He felt that he could do even
better and has decided to consign
them.
Mr. Atkinson's yield is said from
authoritive sources to have averaged
40 barrels to the acre.
By next week it is expected that a
large quantity of potatoes will leave
from Federal Point, East Palatka and
other sections of the east side pota

WANT EIGHT HOUR DAY
Locomotive Engineers
Florida are Included.
of
New York, March 30. The de
mands of nearly four hundred thous
and locomotive engineers, firemen and
trainmen were to be presented to the
generr.1 managers of the several rail
road companies involved at their head
quarters in different parts of the
country today. The employes, who be
long to the so-called big four unions
ask for an eight-hour day with
out reduction in pay and time md a
half for overtime. The railroads
have until April 29 to prepare their
reply.
It is understood that the railroads
already have made ready a tentative
answer which amounts to a condition
al refusl that leaves the way open for
further negotiations. The demands
of the men went to the Wheeling &
Lake Erie Railroad yesterday and the
eight-hour day proposal was refused.
The position of the unions is ex
plained in a statement by the execu
tive boards, which has in chartrc the
submission of the demands today. The
committee's statement says:
"In making the demand for the
eight-hour day, the unions feel them
selves justified, believing that trains
can be so managed that the 100 miles
required of a railroad man per day
can be put inside of eight hours. As
the train service is now, single crew
engines in the switching service on
which only one crew works in the
twenty-four, are often compelled to
work from ten to sixteen hours a day.
It is injustice such as this that the
railway unions want ended."

Last Monday afternoon the music
department of the Woman's Clab gave
a Russian program in the Putnam

John D. Pigue Announces.
Capt. John D. Pigue of Crescent
City who four years ago made such
a phenominal race for Sheriff, though
shy the necessary votes, has made
good his promise to his irienns of that
time and is this week again announc
ing himself as a candidate for the of
fice of Sheriff of Putnam county.
tapt. rigue, who is a steamboat
man and engineer, is well known in
the city and other parts of the coun
ty. He has lived for many years at
Crescent City. Older men m the po
litical game were somewhat inclined
to smile at his aspirations four years
ago, but as the campaign progressed
the smile died. When the votes were
counted it was seen that Capt. Pigue
had carried five large precincts and
secured a substantial vote in most of
the other precincts. There were
three candidates, viz., Sheriff Ken
nerly, M. A. Wilkinson and Capt.
Pigue, who had a total of 412 votes to
117 for Wilkinson and 687 for Kennor-
ly. From that day to this Capt.
Pigue has insisted that he would be a
candidate this year. He is making
good that promise in his announce
ment which appears in this issue of
The News.
This year there are four candidates,
and Capt. Pigue believes that he will
not only hold his old vote, but will
add greatly thereto.
