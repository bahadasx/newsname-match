GERMANS FAIL IN
VERDUNATTACK
Another determined attempt by the
Germans to brenk through the French
lines northwest of Verdun has re?
sulted in failure, and with heavy loss?
es to the Germans.
After dnys of intense artillery prep?
aration for another effort to lessen
the six miles intervening between
them nnd the Paris-Verdun railway
and the nine miles still between them
nnd Verdun, the Germans launched n
great infantry attack on the Ilau
court-Bethincourt sector. In succes?
sive waves the Germans were thrown
in the fray, but all of their attempts
were put down by tho certain fire of
tho French guns and fire of the
French artillery.
There is still an intermittent bom?
bardment northeast of Verdun and
in the Woevrc region the French have
been shelling German positions. In
the Argonne they nre giving, the
Goran lines no rest, while in the Vos
ges tho artillery fire has been marked
on both sides.
- THE BRITISH FRONT.
On the British front, in the St. Elot
sector the Germans opened a heavy
artillery fire on the British forces
holding the ground gained by them
Mondny. Tho British artillery replied
effectively and, according to the Brit?
ish official statement, these positions
arc still inthe hands of the British.
In the Postavy region of the Rus?
sian front Berlin reports that the on?
slaughts of the Russians against the
Germnn lines have been withstood
and that the attacking forces have
suffered heavy casualties. A semi?
official dispatch from Berlin says the
Russians have attacked in thei rnew
offensive with sixty divisions over a
front of 120 kilometers, and that- their
losses have been ot less than 8,000
men.
Heavy Italian bombardments of the
Austrian postiions on the Doberdo
heights and along thelsonze continue*;
A German air squadron has dropp?
ed bombs on the harbor works at Sa?

ment north of Saloniki.
LOST TORPEDO BOAT DESTROY?
ER.
A Germnn torpedo boat destroyer
was rammed and sunk by tho British
light cruiser Cleopatra in tho recent
engagement off the German coast.
There wcro no German survivors.
The American government, through
its ambassador at Berlin, has asked
the German government if its sub?
marines were responsible for the dam?
age sustained by the cross chnnnel
steamer Sussex and the sinking of the
-British steamer Englishman.
Two additional steamers have been
sent to the bottom, the Eagle Point,
a British. vessel, presumably by a
torpedo and the Harriet, a Danish
vessel, by a mine. Tho crews of both
vessels wero saved.
The unity and solidarity of tho en?

Prospect of Election Beins Fa?
vorable to Issue, But Oppo?
nents Are at Work to De?
feat Measure.
The bond issue election takes place
next Tuesday for Jetten sonville Dis?
trict, and every voter should turn out
and vote for tho issue, and seo to it
thnt his neighbor votes. Remember,
another election, should this one fail
of a majority, cannot be held within
the next two ycnrs. It is "now or
never," as we say. Take nothing for
granted. Work and vote as though
tho election bo n close one. and it
.may bo.
. Warning from Clear Fork District
While tho election carried in Clear
Fork district by a safe majority, there
was u surprisingly largo vote against
it. Precincts gnvo votes against it
that was a surprise.
This paper gave warning of this
last week. We knew what we wore
talking about then. This warning
is repeated with regard to Jcffor
sonvillc District. Not much is being
said but something is being done,
against the issue in this district by
men who don't want it to carry. They
perhaps have roads already through
or by their farms, and they are wiling
to stop right there. The issue is go?
ing to carry, but should it ho de?
feated this defeat will be duo to over
confidence and neglect on the part of
its friends and would bo a crushing
calamity to this district and to the
the issue, and see thnt your neighbor
votes.
The good of our churches, schools,
stores, farms, and every social in?
terests nre concerned.
A MAN OF WAR.
(Editorial.)
Mr. J. N. Ilarmnn is for Col. Roos?
evelt for President. Mr. Roosevelt is
a man of war. Therefore, Mr. Hair
man is an advocate of war.
We so infer from his article pub?
lished in the Roanoke Times. Mr.
Ilarmnn is absolutely certain that
had Mr. Roosevelt been President
long ago our army would have invad
pd Mexico and settled matters there,
and declared war on Germany and
done other wonderful things, all of
which no doubt he would have done.
Mr- Harnian has three sons. He was
asked the other day whether or not
hi case volunteers were called for, he
would urge his sons to enlist. "No,
sir;" was his reply. That's just it.
People wdio clamor for war will be the
last to bare their breasts to the ene
| my's bullets, or agree for their sons
ito be fed into the mouths of the can?
non. The whole country, every fath?
er and mother in it, hns reason to
thnnk God that such a bloody, unscru?
pulous man ns Roosevelt is not Pres?
ident, and abundant reason to pray
.that he never will be. And it may be
safely guaranteed that such a prayer
will be answered, at least practically,
for the Rough Rider will never be
President of these United States
ngain.
HIGH SCHOOL INSPECTED.
A Mild Criticism?The School Man?
agement Commended.
Prof. Lincoln, state school inspector,
reached Tazewell on the 28th, and
inspected the different departments,
and expressed himself as highly pleas?
ed, nnd the management, advance?
ment of pupils, etc., seemed entirely
satisfactory.
The only criticism offered was in
regard to the regulation of the heat
in some of the rooms, lie said the
heat in some of the rooms seemed to
be kept too high. It wns pointed out
jcgulntion of heat in the rooms re?
quired a good deal of the teachers
time which she could ill afford, and
perhaps the mnttor sometimes over?
looked.
Tho inspector stated that the work?
ing system of the school, class work,
??Kcinline and all compared very fa
vorably'V.th i,hc best high schools of
tho state. "
He seemed specially -pleased- WJM
the progress of the high school pupils
and said that this advancement was
equal to, if not grnter than those he
had examined in other pnrts of the
State.
Mr. Lincoln left the impression that
everything was entirely satisfactory,
with the single minor criticism rc
feretl to above.
Prof. Golehon nnd his corps of faith?
ful teachers, the School Bonrd, pat?
rons and all concerned, have reason
to bo proud of the report of Mr,
Lincoln and of the school generally.
Its efficiency is due to the faithful
work of the teachers and the efficient
management of tho principal.

RS" REVOLT
Bull Moose Delegates
From Buchanan
Not Recognized
Followers of Roosevelt Subject?
ed to Steam Roller Method of
Squelching ? Factions at
Daggers Point Now.
The report comes to town that tho
"Hog-Hackers" or Bull-Moosors from
Buchanan county to tho Republican
district convention hold at Pulnski on
Monday, were subjected to the hu?
miliation of being thrown out of tho
meeting by the "Stand-Patters," and
that as a result the Hog-Back dele?
gates may call n separate convention
of their own and send delegates to
the Chicago convention.
The trouble has been browing for
sometime in Buchanan, and is backed
by Hon. E. 11. Witten, J. 11. Stin
son, .1. Glen Ratlin*, Rlloy Lester, W.
R. Perkins, .lohn C. McCoy, and other
loading Republicans of Buchanan, who
maintain a separate organisation from
tho old-line Republicans with Bogle
Shortridgo as county chairman. W.
A. Daughorty Is chairman of the reg?
ular or stand-pat Republicans.
Both delegations came over front
Grundy Monday on their way to Pu
laski and if is said thai several lights
between the factions were narrowly
averted. One of the dolcgatos, Hiley
Lester, who was "steam rollered" at
Pulaski, says ho will return to Buch?
anan county, and see who's who; that
the "Hog-Back" delegates will wage
relentless war on the old standpatters
unt il the victory is won or I hoy are
crushed to earth.
Numerous political cartoons have
been in circulation in Buchanan that
have helped to make the brooch b'e
iwoon the factions wider, One ear
toon in particular was It picture of
a hog standing on the track of the
Hitter Lumber Company, holding up
tho train, which has its local signifi?
cance.

getting very warm and developments
are eagerly awainled.
TIIK OUSTER BILL NOW LAW.
i?I-1
Richmond, Vn., March 27.?Among
the llfty-ono hills approved by Gov?
ernor Stuart and given bis signature
are tho Ma thews anti-gambling law
an dthe ouster bill, two of the several
moral and social welfare measures
enacted by the recent general assem?
bly.
The Madlows niifi-ganibliuw bill,
complementary to the Stephenson bill,
which passed during the early weeks
of (lie session, is one of tho most
drastic measures ever enacted. If
strikes at the heart of gambling and
its enforcement will make tho oltl
familiar practices of betting a hat or
matching to see who pays, loo risky
to lie, indulged hereafter. These aro
rograded in the popular mind as mild
forms of gambling and in some minds
as no gambling at. all, yet they are
forbidden by the new law and thuir
indulgence will mean punishment.
Tlie penalty provided in the law is
from six months to twelve months in
jail. There is no provision for the
payment of line. ( ,
The signing by the Governor oi tho
ouster bill means that one of the most
drastic pieces of legislation ever on
uclcd in the state of Virginia is law.
It. is a law that will insure the enforce?
ment id' all the laws on the statute
books. It provides that those officers
who fail to perform faithfully thoir
duly in enforcing the laws of tho state
shall bo discharged from office?oust?
ed, after having had a chanco to de?
fend thwmsolvcs?and that other of
liers who will enforce the Inws will
he put in their place.
The operation of the ouster law
extends to all officers, State, county
and municipal, charged with law en?
forcement. It applies in tho lan?
guage of the law itself to nil "oxcept
such officers as are by tho constitu?
tion removable only nnd exclusively
by methods other than thoso provided
by this act," and so hits every person
I in the stato who holds "nny office or
trust or profit under and by virtue of
I any of the laws of tho state of Vir?
ginia," who shall knowingly or wil?
lingly misconduct himself in office.
Such misconduct as defined by the
net consists of knowingly or wilfully
neglecting "to perform any duty en?
joined upon such officer by any law
of tho State of Virginia, and tho
wording of tho net continues, "or who
shall in any public place bo in a state
of intoxication produced by any ar?
dent spirits voluntarily taken or who
shall engage in any form of gambling
constituting violation of any penal
statune involving moral turpitude.
