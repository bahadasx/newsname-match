EL PASO, Texas, March 81^-Villa

the Carranza garrison at Guerrero,
according to General Gavira of Juarez
today. A report from General Oaba

mention of any loss to the garrison
Gavira ridiculed reports that Villa
massacred nearly two hundred men,
women and children there. The gar
rison only numbered fifty men. ac

Brigadier General Bell of Fort
Bliss, who according to the "rumor

Funston at San Antonio, stated to
day that his only information regard

the newspapers. Bell said he had no
further advices from Brigadier Gen

since Pershing reported Villa passed
Guerrero Monday. Gavira's Impres
sion from the Cabazas report was
that the skirmish took place Wednes
day or Thursday.
According to local newspapermen,
Gavira last night stated 100 were
killed in the Guerrero fighting. While
Gavira said be had no further dis
patches this morning his statement
today was:
"Skirmishes at Guerrero were very
much exaggerated. The message

Aviators Are Superior.

OTHERS) HEA-DQUARTEMS AIMTORI
OAJ* ARMY NB1AR DUBLAN, Mexloo,
March SO. (By motor train to Colum
bus, N. M., March 81.)—The experi
ence of American army flyers la Mex
ico has made them the superior of any
aerial force In the world of equal num
bers. Captain B. B. Foulols of the
first aero squadron made this claim
today in the face of criticism of his
men.
"Our aviators are dally encounter
ing conditions no airmen ever before
have faced," he said. "The Sierra
Madres over whioh our planeB must
fly, create shifting winds and danger
ous air pockets. The altitude of
nearly a mile above sea level gives
the machines only about another milo
leeway as their maximum altitude Is
two miles. Despite this and the add
ed handicap of very rough country for
landing, the squadron of eight aero
planes has gone through the campaign
so fa* without any real serious mis
hap. As the expedition moves farth
er south, an altitude of nearly two
miles will be encountered and this
will test the machines and the men
to the utmost. Their experience now
'makes them the superior of any aer
ial force in the world."
Regular aerial mail service has
been established between here and
Cotumbus.
Following an aeroplane's flight
south, a column of Infantry also left
the base camp here today after Villa,
who Is somewhere 176 miles south, of
Dublan. A tralnloaj of Carranza
troopB also passed through nearby
Casas Grandes, gotng southward. A
email band of C&rranzIstaB is actively
co-operating with the American van
guard. Brigadier General Pershing
expresses the greatest satisfaction
with the treatment accorded him by
'the representatives of the defacto
government.
Despite this co-operation and the
friendliness of the native Mexicans,
army officers believe catching Villa
will be a long, hard Job. Some of the
difficulties experienced by the Ameri
can soldiers in the higher and colder
altitudes south of hero may be guessed
from the bitter cold weather in Dub
Ian. Half an inch of ice formed in
buckets during the night. It Is rumor
ed that the chase after Villa Satur
day went on in a snow storm.
The native Mexicans are staking
everything on the success of the ex
pedition. If the bandits are not thor
oughly wiped out, Mexican farmers
fear they will return and murder
everyone who sold produce to the
American soldiers. Villa Is reported
to have killed Mexicans for merely
adopting American ideas and working

NEW YORK, March 31.—"Tho
strange case of Dr. Arthur Warren
Waite" to apply a fiction title to the
mystery that has been invested with
every conceivable thrill, had a fresh
thriller added to It today wlien a,
posse searched a wide expanse of
sand dunes for buried money.
The money is $9,000 in bills. It was
paid to Eugene Oliver Kane, an em
balmer to give testimony that he
used arsenic in the embalming fluid
used on John E. Peck, Grand Rapids
millionaire whom Dr. Waite pois
oned. The case has involved ro
mance, love, "other women," occult
ism, millions of dollars, subtle and
violent poisoning, family history, the
"man from Egypt" and Intimations
of insanity. Now comes the element
that rivals Poe's famous "gold bug."
After Kane got the money from Dr.
Waite, a few days after the Peck
funeral he kept silence. Late yes
terday while District Attorney Bwann
was pushing a nation wide search
for him, he walked into Swann's of
