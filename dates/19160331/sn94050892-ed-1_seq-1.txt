pounds per month, soon to be in
creased to 10,000,000, and with two

more than 11,000,000 pounds per
month. Miami Copper company . is
outputting in excess of 4,000,000
pounds of copper per month and ex-
pects to produce 50,000,000 pounds this
year, and Old Dominion's production
is running close to 3,000,000 pounds
monthly., Also, shipments of ores
from local mines to the Douglas and
El Paso smelters add largely to the
! copper production of the Globe-Miami
district.

Hoffman for Sheriff
Morenci, March 31. It became
known here this week that Johnny
Hoffman, at present Constable of this
l.recinct, will be a candidate for the
democratic nomination for Sheriff in
the primaries this fall. Morenci demo
crats are enthusiastic in their support
of Hoffman, who during his long ser
vice as a peace officer in this precinct
has proven himself a fearless and im
partial officer who stands first, last
and all the time for the enforcement
of law and order regardless of who
the offender may be. Mr. Hoffman
has been on the firing line, as It
were, for the past four years, without
a day's vacation. Mr. Hoffman is no
stranger to the people of Greenlee
county and is particularly well
known among the cattlemen and
farmers in tr-e outlying districts as
well as enjoying a wide circle of
friends in the CHfton-Morenci dis
trict who have encouraged Mr. Hoff
man to enter the race.

; Criticism as an - Incompetent By
. Those Officers Who Have Received
Their Dismissal.

Charles W. Harris, adjutant general
of hte Arizona National Guard, is In
competent; and is using that organi
zation to- further the political" ambi
tions of himself and Governor Hunt,
Is the charge made today by deposed
officers of the guard .
The Arizona guard has been In a
serious way for some time. Since
Harris was appointed by Hunt there
has been nothing but trouble and dis
satisfaction . Conditions finally be
came so bad that Hunt asked the war
department to detail a regular army
captain to take charge Captain
Cromwell Stacey was sent here fol
lowing that request. He was in
charge of the guard for a year, and
brought it up to a high standard of
efficiency. As soon as he turned his
back to Harris, things became worse.
Governor Becomes Alarmed.
With the approaching inspection,
Hunt became alarmed and .asked the
war department to have Stacey again
placed In Charge. The request was re-
STonr did Tt RiZZZ
would be to blame.
Captain Gulley, one of the deposed
officers stated that because he oppos-
ed Hunt and Harris he was put on the
lunassigned list. The Hay bill which
will probably pass in a few days will
give militia officers a good sized
salary.
Is Menace to Guard. 1
Unless things take a. decided Change
within a short time, and Harris is de
posed, Arizona will have no national
guard. . '
Harris told' local officers that they
were ia dgnore any suggestions com
ing from Stacey,. as he (Harris) was
in .charge of affairs.

THE METAL MARKET
Copper Is firmer and the market is
more active. For June, July and
August deliveries Jake Is 27 1-4 to
27 1-2 cents and electrolytic is 27 1-8
to 27 3-8 cents a pound. Spot cop
per Is practically unobtainable at
around 28 cents. Both foreign and
domestic, consumers have been in
the market making purchases this
week and tjiere are inquiries for some
substantial amounts of copper. The
foreign visible supply Is continuing to
decrease and this has brought about
an advance of 22 per ton recently
in the price of standard copper.
Electrolytic is still selling In Lndonat
136, equivalent to 28.90 cents per
pound.
The peace talk which has been cir
culated so generally of late to de
press the stock market appears to
have had no effect whatver on cop
per. Consumers do not need to be
told that there is absolutely nothing
in these peace rumors, for they are
receiving requests ' every week to
bid on specifications for munitions
and other war supplies. There Is
still every prospect that the European
war will continue at least a year and
possibly three years longer and
meanwhilje it is reasonably certain
that the price of copper will remain
abnormally high.

pleasure of the guests. A large
number of tickets have been sold
