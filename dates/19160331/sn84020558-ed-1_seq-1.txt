LEWES, Del., March 30. How one
German stowaway held up the captain
and 66 members of the crew of the
British steamer Matoppo, compelling
them at the point of a pistol to change
the course of the vessel and land him
ul the Delaware breakwater after he
had rifled the ship's safes and taken
their valuables, was told here tonight
by Captain Bergner, master of the
Matoppo.
. The stowaway, who said his name
was Ernest Schiller .and hat he had
lived in Hoboken, N. J., for the last
eight months,' is in jail here awaiting
the arrival of the U. S. District At
torney from Wilmington, Del., and the
British consul general from Philadel
phia. The holdup took place outside the
three mile limit and federal authori
ties here say that this government, un
der the circumstances, probably will
have nothing to do with the matter.
Schiller, they say, will be returned to
the Matoppo and turned over to Brit
ish officials at St. Lucia, where the
vessel will stop for coal.
The Matoppo sailed from New York
yesterday for Valdivostok with a cargo
consisting chiefly of barbed wire and
farm implements. She passed Sunday
Hook at 6 o'clock in the evening and
two hours later upon entering his cab
in. Captain Bergner says he was con
fronted by a young man with a revol
ver in each hand. "Hands up and not
a sound' Jf'yolf" VaTue"your life," was
the command that greeted him.
The captain was bound hand and foot
and locked in his cabin, promising un
der penalty of death, not to raise an
alarm. Then cautiously making his
way to the wireless cabin, the stowa
way, who is about 26 years old, put the
instruments out of commission, and
threw the ship's guns, consisting of six
rifles, overboard. He then returned
to the captain's cabin, rifled the safe
and destroyed many important papers.
He had expected, he told Captain
Bergner, to find at least 2,000 in Eng
lish money aboard the Matoppo, but in
this his hopes were shattered. There
was not a penny in the safe. Later,
however, Schiller compelled the cap
tain and the first officer to hand over
pocketbooks containing a total of about
30.
With Captain Bergner still a pris
oner in his own cabin, Schiller proceed
ed to round up the crew of 56 men,
all but a few of whom were in their
bunks. He lined all .hands up in one
end of the, ship and threatened to
blow everybody to pieces with bombs
He said he had placed In different
parts of the vessel if anyone made a
move.
At four o'clock this morning Schil
ler released Captain Bergner and still
gripping a revolver in each hand, or
dered the steamer headed toward shore5.
Other officers and members of the
crew were likewise ordered to their
places and'tpld to put on all speed
for the Delaware Capes.
When the Matoppo came within sight
of land about noon, Schiller ordered a
small boat. lowered to take him ashore.
Meanwhile the steamer's signals asking
for assistance hud been sighted by the
pilot boat, Philadelphia, which immed
iately responded to the call and took
the small boat in tow, disregarding the
threats of Schiller, who still was in
possession of his guns and threatened
to shoot anybody who laid a hand on
him.
Steaming for the Delaware break
water, the Philadelphia was met off-
Cape Henlopen, Delaware, by a- Coast
Guard power boat, which had put out
from Lewes In answer to the Matoppo's
signals. Captain John S. Lynch, coast

CLEVELAND Ohio, March 30. In
vestigation into the wreck of three
New York Central trains at Amherst,
Ohio, which took a toll of at least
twenty-eight lives the exact number
may never De known and brought
injury to more than forty others,
several of whom probably will not re
cover, got under way today.
With a fierce controversy raging
among railroad employes as to who
was responsible for the accident, rep
resentatives of the state of Ohio and
of the federal government were told
by officials of the New York Central
lines that the railroad officials would
pot conduct a separate formal inquiry
on their own part They asserted
the best interests of all concerned
would be .best served by one inves
tigation on the part of the represent
atives of the Ohio Utilities Commis
sion and of the Interstate Commerce
Commission. The railroad officials
would give every help, they said, "to"!
make the investigation complete and
the railroad would abide by the find
ings of these bodies, whatever they
are.
The inspecting of the signal block
apparatus at Amherst was the main
work of the government experts to
day. ' Taking a special train the in
vestigators went to the scene of the
wreck and inspected it, though hur
riedly. The controversy among rail
road employes centered about A. H.
Ernst, 23, towerman at Amherst, and
Herman Hess, 56, veteran engineer,
whose train rammed into .the first
section of train No. 88, causing the
deaths of nearly all of those killed.
Ernst vehemenotly denies that he
was asleep on duty, or that he was in
such condition from loss of sleep that
he was in any way incapacitated.
Ernst said:
"If anyone i trying to fasten the
blame in this affair on me I shall
make affidavits to what I know
of signal failures in the past on this
and other roads."
Hess repeated his former state
ment that he was not given any sig
nal, but did not dispute Ernst's word
that the signal might have failed to
work. '

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, March 30. A final
review of the administration s pre-
aredness plans for the navy was
iven the house naval committee to
day by Secretary Daniels who will be
the last witness heard before the
committee begins framing its bill.
The secretary added in several re
spects to the program he had mapped
out in estimates previously submitted
the committee. He urged the
establishment of a government plant
manufacture naval projectiles;
asked for about 15,000 additional mfn
instead of 10.000 and proposed that
civilian educators be placed at the
head of the non-military departments
of the Naval Academy.
Requesting that all provisions for
air service be stricken out of the five
ear building program, Mr. Daniels
rged an appropriation of $2,000,000
fo air craft this year. He explained
that thee was no way of determining
hat expenses would be necessary in
the future.
Criticism of Secretary Daniel's ad
ministration of the department fore-
hadowed by the course of certain
committee members in examining
previous witnesses, probably will ma
terialize tomorrow. The secretary was
Iways allowed to proceed without in-
erruption today, taking up the items
n the program one by one. He will
conclude his statement tomorrow and
be questioned by the committeemen.
Questions of the construction of
battleships versus battle cruisers, of
the size anJ speed of future subma
rines anil othr subjects most debat
ed during the prolonged hearing, vvera
not reported. Mr. Daniels' statements
outside of these relating to personnel,
had to do almost wholly with indus
trial problems of the service.
An outline of the department's
lan for building up an adequate re
serve force for the navy was pre
sented by the secretary. It provides
for five classes of reservists. The
irst, to be known as the fleet re
serve, would be composed oi tormers
officers and enlisted men; the second
or naval reserve, of officers and 'men
of the sea-going profession for ser-
ice on fighting ships in war; the
third or naval auxiliary reserve of
shipmasters and seamen enrolled for
war time duty on the auxiliary fleets;
the fouth, or naval coast defense re
serve, of residents on or near the
coast "capable of serving aboard min-
ng craft, patrol vessels, torpedo
beats, aircraft and the like for duty
on the coasts and in their respective
districts and the fifth, or volunteer
naval reserve of men who would have
no duty in peace times, but as owners
of yachts, power boats,or other craft
could render efficient aid in war
times.
Secretary Daniels urged the com
mittee to report favorably the armor
plate factory hill which recently
passed the senate and which will be
taken up next Tuesday. He laid
strees on the necessity in his opinion
of providing' means for establishing
a fair price for armor or other ma
terial needed by the navy through
equipping government plants to pro
duce whatever could not .be obtained
at a satisfactory figure by contract.
A projectile plant, Mr. Daniels de
clared, was vitally Important to the
navy. With commercial concerns
flooded with war order? from Eurcpe.
he said, prices were going up and it
ha3 been very' impossible to obtain
what the navy must have. He added
that a government plant would make
it possible to guard against navy in
ventions getting into the ihands of
possible enemy powers as was now
almost certain to be the case. .
The secretary read a long state
ment showing the fluctuations in the
price of projectiles asked by bidders.

gaged in manufacturing projectiles for

WASHINGTON. March 30. The
Burnett immigration bill, with its lit
eracy test and Asiatic exclusion pro
vision unchanged, passed the house
late today by a vote of 308 to 87. It
now goes to the senate, where favor
able action is regarded as assured.
The literacy test, about which the
fight against the bill had centered, was
sustained, 284 to 107. This provision
has been the cause of vetoes of sim
ilar immigration bills bv Presidents
Cleveland, Taft and Wilson. The
house passed the bill over the Cleve
land veto, but it failed in the senate.
Motions to override the veto of Presi
dents Taft and Wilson were lost in the
house by narrow margins. Represen
tative Burnett, chairman of the im
migration committee, predicted to
night that there was sufficiert strength
to repass the bill in the event of an
other veto. The president has not in
dicated his , purpose to the house
leaders.
Both record votes on the literacy
test and on the passage of the bill
were without regard to party lines.
Majority Leader Kitchin voted for the
literacy test and for the bill. Minor
ity Lender Mann voted against the lit
eracy test and then for the bill.
During the debate today the Hum
phrey reciprocal exclusion" amendment,
adopted Tuesday, aimed at retaliation
upon British Columbia because of its
exclusion of unskilled labor from this
and other foreign countries, was modi
fied upon discovery that it operated
against immigration from Russia. It
was changed so as to make it applica
ble only to a "contiguous" foreign
country.
Representative Bennet of New York

Louis Marshall of New York, point
ing out that the amendment as orig

DISFRANCHISING ALE ENEMIES

DOUGLAS, Ariz., March 30. Venus
tiano Carranza, de facto president of
Mexico, has notified General P. Elias
Calles, military governor of Sonora, of
his approval of a decree promulgated
several weeks ago by Calles, disfran
chising all "enemies of the govern
ment," according to ' Consul Ives G.
Lelevler.
Under its provisions, even though
amnesty were granted such persona,
their vote and the right to hold office
would be taken from them.
Considered more important, however,
was a clause at the end of the procla
irtation, in which General Calles dele
gated to himself the legislative as well
as executve authority of the state until
such time as constitutional elections
could be held and the vstate congress
assembled. The recognition of the de
cree by Carranza makes the governor
a virtual dictator in Sonora.
It is rumored here, but not officially
confirmed, that General Carranz also
approved the decree of General Calles,
issued about the same time, providing
tor the confiscation of the property of
"enemies of the government," and ita
a newspaper story that Villa had
turned to the north. Military authori
ties discredited the story.
On the heels of this story, a ranch
man, whose name was not made pub-
I lie, reported to Major W. R. Sample,
commandant, that he believed the ac-
tiens of a Mexican family living about
two miles west of the town to be sus
picious. He said that the lights in the
windows on the south side of the house
have been fashed in a way that might
indicate they were signals. ' .

railroad for transportation of supplies
to the American expedition hunting
Villa will be given a fair trial, and
in the meantime the United Suites
will press for an extension of fur
ther definition of the arrangement
General Funston has been instruct
ed to proceed with shipments to Gen
eral Pershing's columns under such
conditions as the Mexican de ' facto
authorities prescribe, and .determina
tion to seek a more satisfactory un

unless it is found impracticable to
transport completely and satisfac
torily necessary supplies to the re
strictions imposed. Reports to the
war department tonight showed that
General Funston was preparing to
tender his first consignment to the
railroad and it is expected that it will
be done tomorrow.
Doubt regarding the adequacy of
Carranza's concessions is expressed
freely in official quarters. Secretary
Lansing, like Secretary Baker, how
ever, said tonight that it remained
to be seen what results would be
secured.
Secretary Baker authorized denial
of reports that General Funston had
evinced irritation at the authorities
for failure to make a more compre
hensive and definite arrangement for
the use of the railways. While offi
cials realized that army officers on
the border may be restive over the
delay in diplomatic negotiations, it
was declared that no friction has re
sulted. There were no important military
developments reported In dispatches

SAN ANTONIO, March 30. After
killing every one of the one hundred
and seventy-two men in the garrison.
at Guerrero, Francisco Villa moved
northward yesterday and now is some
where near the head water of the
Santa Maria river, according to unof"
ficial information secured by General
Funston tonight At the head of a con
siderable force, Villa was reported to be
on the Santa Geronimo ranch or the
Quemado ranch and troops of both the
United States and Mexico were be
lieved to he closing in on him.
This information was regarded by
General Funston and his staff as prob
ably correct If correct, it appeared
probable that very soon Villa either
will have to face his pursuers in fight
or make another break through the
tightening line of troops.
Whether his assault on the garrison
at Guerrero was the same engagement
reported by Gen. Pershing was not
known, but it was considered likely
since the action reported by General
Pershing occurred March 27 somewhere
In that region.
General Pershing has been advised
of the report as to Villa's location and
it is known that the disposition of his
troops and those of the Mexican gov
ernment are such that Villa cannot
easily escape without a fight. Ameri
can .troops are converging in columns
from the north and it was indicated
that part of them had gone so far
south that they would be able to join
with the Carranza forces in preventing
his escape in that direction.
Where Villa is tonight remainded
unknown to General Funston, but Gen
eral Pershing reported during the day
that on Monday he was defeated near
Guerrero. After the fight with Carran
za's soldiers at the edge of the moun
tainous district south of Namiquipa,
Villa was known to be making his way
south and General Pershing's cavalry
resumed their unrelenting- ride on his
trail, notwithstanding it may lead them
into the dangerous passes of moun
tains of the region.
General Funston delayed using the
northwestern railway today for the
shipment of supplies to the troops in
Mexico pending a conference of Gen
eral Gavira, commander of Mexican
troops at Juarez, General Bell, post
commander at EI Paso, and Andreas
Garcia, Mexican consul at El Paso.
It is expected that shipments over
that route will begin tomorrow but
there was a disposition at army head
quarters today to move cautiously. The
failure of Carranza to give permission
to guard the supplies .-as a sharp dis
appointment and a surprise to Ameri
can army men and it was believed
that even yet some arrangement might
be made whereby supplies entering
Mexico might be safeguarded.
The ordinary movement of supplies
along the route from Columbus. N. M.,
continued today and until it is demon
strated that the rail route has proved"
satisfactory, the long line of motor
trucks will not be retired from service.
