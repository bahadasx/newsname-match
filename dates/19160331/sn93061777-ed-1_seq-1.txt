INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE
PUTS 0. K. ON BOND ISSUE
Majority of Committee Upon Investigation Say That
$35,000 Issue is Necessary to Complete Improvements
Contemplated. Suburbanites Need Water and Fire
Protection.
Three members of the com
mittee of five appointed at the
Independent meeting last Thurs
day night to investigate the pro
posed $35,000 bond issue to be
voted upon next Tuesday, have
reported favorably. They are
K. C Childers, A. B. Austin
and 7. E. Meyers. In addition
to the cost of the water and
sewerage main extension, new
fire plugs and another well
they believe that additional
plant equipment will be neces
sary if a large saving is to be
made in fuel.
They report that the present
capacity of the plant is 200 K.
W. The maximum lighting
load now is 175 K. W. as com
pared with 120 K. W. one year
ago and that the pumping load
is 50 K. W. By adding one
200 K. W. generator with en
gine they estimate the saving
iit fuel to be 25 per cent and
that the present fuel bill is
$7,000 a year. The cost of this
new equipment will be $13575,00
The cost of an additional well
will be $3,000.
The present fire protection
with 12 fire plugs is serving
about 2T per cent of the prop
erty. By incrrasing the num
ber to 45 plugs it will serve 90
per cent. The cost of this im
provement will aggregate ap
proximately $9,635.
The presertt sewerage system
is serving abjut 40 per cent
and with the increased exten-
bions it will serve about 70
uer cent. The aDnroximate cost
of this work will be about $7,000
or 8,000.
The present tire fighting ca
pacity .with two streams.' is two
hours. With the proposed in
crease it will be 10 to 12 hour.

has now about the same firt

One of the new stores in 'Clo

recently opened for business
with a large and well selected
stock of dry goods, shoes, no
fons, etc.
The new store which is locat
ed in the Jackson building on
north Main street 'presents a
most inviting and attractive
appearance. Mr. Jac&man is
making some special prices on
new spring and summer goods.

Eugene V. Debs
Clovis and the surrounding
country will have the opportun
ity of hearing one of the great
est orators of the Social revolu
tion in the person of Eugene
Debs who is known noth Nation
al and inter-National. Debs is
touring the west to the Pacific
coabt. and Clovis-is the only sop
for him in the Sunshine State,
and you will miss a treat if you
fail to hear him at the new Ait
Dome Theater Friday, April 14th
at 8:30 p. m.
Note what these great men
say of him.
"Go search the earth from end
to end
And where's a better all-round
friend
Than Eugene Debs?- a man that
stands
And iest holds out in his two
hands
A9 warm a heart as ever beat
Betwixt here and the Mercy
Seat!"
JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY.
"Gene Debs is the most lov
able man I ever knew. Debs i.
sincere. His heart is as gentle
as a woman's and as fresh as a
mountain brook. If Debs were
a priest, the world would listen
to his eloquence, and that gentle,
musical voice and sad, sweet
smile of his would soften the
hardest heart."

New Racket Store.
Ed Joiner, who conducted the
Suite Bar is not to be discour
aged and "give up the ship"
simply because he was vo;ed
out of business. He lias the
nerve and pluck to adapt him
self to the changed conditions
and will open a novelty or rack
et store in the building formerly
occupied by the saloon. He re
turned this week from1 market
where he purchased a big stock
of new coods and will soon be
ready lor business.
We believe that people will
feel inclined to give him a boost
in his new enterprise by a lib
eral patronage.

Livery Barn Burns
The larne sheet iron liver
n.trn on Hagt-rmann Avenue be
tween Main and Mitchell street
was destrn ed by fire Thursrlav
morning about ten o'clock. Th
ouiidii'g was the property c
A. S Beck and was leased b
Dave Owen. The animals were
all taken out from the stable
and lots adjoining but the fir
spread so rapidly that it wa
impossible to save the buggies,
harness and other equipment.
The origin of the fire is unknown
but 19 supposed that it caiuli
from a cigarette cailes-ly thrown
about the building, which was i
mass of flames before the alarm
was sounded. The department
responded promptly and although
a strong north wind was blow
ing, they succeeded in keeping
tin- flames confined to the stable
building. The Sants Fe depart
ment was also on hand to pro
ttct the company property. The
buggies and harness were insur
ed for $800.00 and the barn for
$500.00.

Claud Guillaland, a relative ol
W. M. Ogg, sustained a broken

sometime before a passer' by
came along and brought him to
town. Ho is at the Santa Fe

The Independent Candidates
Every candidate on the Inde
pendent ticket has pledged him
self, if elected, to look after the
interests of the city as carefully
as his own. There is no need
in disputing the fact that with
the people paying taxes on a bond
issue of $125,000 for municipal
ownership of public utilities and
with the revenue from this vast
expenditure running so closelv
at the end of the month, that
it is sometimes on the "red"
side of the ledger, that there is
something wrong. With that
investment, properly managed,
it should be laying up a good
surplus. Wnat would an indi
vidual say if he Jiad $125,000
invested in sucn an enterprise
and he tailed to receive divi
dents? There must be a leak-
4K somewhere. Gentlemen,
where is it? Possibly some new
olood in the council can find it.
It not. conditions could be no
r.-e No there is no issue of
the "disgruntled wets" and
.-.oculists on one side and those
iio fought, bled and died for
piohiuitiou on the other, but an
i-sue that means that a change
in some of the aldermen, might
iv beneficial at this time. There
is no doubt that a certain com
oi nation has been at work for
.he last year or two, to "run"
the city affairs to t-uit them
selvfs, and to make the people
ike it. A financial statement of
the condition of the city has
not been published for months,
,.',8.itly years. Is this private
dimness or ate the people en
titled to know how much "their
oiant" is earning or losing?
The nominees on the Indepen-
lent ticket favor publishing at
fast a quarterly report in both
papers of the financial condition
of the city. If we vote $35,000
more we will have $160,000 in
ves ed. Are they not entitled
to know, or is this insignificant
little sum simply invested for
the manipulation of others?
We do not mean to criticise
ALL the members of the city
council, neither do we state that
ALL the nominees oh the citi
zens ticket would not be accept
able, but we do believe that a
change in some instances would
dh for the best intersests of all
parties concerned. A member
of the state legislature is not
allowed by law to be financially
benefitted by his own legisla
tion. The same rule should ap
ply to a councilman.
Battle Cry of Peace
The new film, the Battle Cry
of Pea:e, to be shown at the
Lyceum April 3 and 4 is one of
the greatest film productions in
the world. A prominent Clovis
lawyer who recently saw it in
Santa Fe says that it cost him a
dollar admission and that he
thought the picture was well
worth the price. The Lyceum
will be able to show it for 50
cents.
