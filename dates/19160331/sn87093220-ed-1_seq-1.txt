HOME TRADE
BOOSTED AT
BIG BANQUET

.Need Is Emphasized of
"Trade at Home"
Slogan
Last Monday night at the Hotel
Washington the trade at home com
mittee of the Aberdeen Chamber of
Commerce gave a dinner to officially
.and publicly launch the campaign
"which is to do great things for the
business upbuilding of this city and
surrounding country. The committee
consists of P. A. Bertrand, chairman,
J. S. Waugh, T. H. Blyth, Charles
-lolmer and J. J. Kaufman and they
jertainly did their work thoroughly
and well.
Some 225 sat down to the dinner,
which, from a gastronomical stand
point, was a huge success and perfect
in every way. J. W. Clark was toast
master and was a decided success.
Speeches were made by Major H.
"W. Patton of the Hoquiam Washing
tonian, Phil S. Locke, H. B. < Elder,
W. H. Tucker, W. B. Mack, E. A. Mi
lette Geo. J. Wolff, J. A. Hood and
Ino. A. Stimson.
| Every phase of the trade at home
ideation was thoroughly discussed by
the speakers, much outspoken, plain
language was used and an infinitely
better understanding was reached as
to what course of action the business
Interests of our city must pursue in
the future.
The best of feeling prevailed, but
a distinct note pervaded the meeting
that, as a body of business men, more
rational and sensible procedure must
be Inaugurated and followed if we
«xpect to forge ahead. Possibly never
before was there such a large and
representative gathering of Aberdeen
business men, and when the sharp
■edges are worn off and cool, calm
reasoning has had an inning, a great
good is sure to be the result.
Mr. Bertrand outlined the future
work of this committee, which was
unanimously voted as the proper pro
gram to follow.
President A. C. Gaillac recounted
the work of the Chamber of Commerce
showing progress that is of the high
est and best kind.
These dinners are to be a regular
feature every month, so that the con
tinuation of the work may not be re
tarded.

By jinks, but those telegrams re
ceived and read during the evening
were certainly hot stuff.
"Be sure your sins will find you
out."
It's dollars to doughnuts that "cer
i tain people" will buy more In town

There was not a slow minute dur

Nothing of this kind was indulged
in during the evening,
THE ABERDEEN HERALD
EIGHT PAGES
It was left to J. S. Waugh to fur
nish one of the most thoughtful sur
prises of the evening, which consisted
of a nice box of candy with a card
inscribed, "For the lady who could
not attend," and a card stating that
its was presented with his compli
ments. In passing, let us say that
the candy came from the Broadway
Pharmacy and Crammatte's Sweet
Shop.
Then again, Blytli & Blyth were
not so very slow, and knew what it
takes to top off a good meal, viz: A
"Think of Me" perfecto, so they fur
nished a generous supply for all pres
ent. These cigars are made by L. L.
Maley, Aberdeen.
Smith's dairy came to the front with
an individual bottle of milk, proper
ly labeled, for every guest. It was
much appreciated.
The makers of "Lifestaff" also fur
nished a generous supply of that
product but the peculiar thing about
this is that not more than one bottle
in ten was opened. This is a mys
tery too deep for us to explain. Is
it because the "recoil and kick" is
absent, and as a drink it is a "four
flusher"?
Goodbar Jones was the official an
nouncer of the telegrams which were
delivered by uniformed messengers.
Everyone spoke of the perfect ser
vice and the truly fine dinner which
was really a $1 spread. Mr. Morck
did himself proud.
While there were some gentle roasts
and speaking minus embroidery, trim
ming or lace, still It was all taken in
good part as it was all intended for
the good of our fine city.
Brother Mack knows how to tell a
story with good effect. The one about
the darky and the assafoetida was
somewhat highly perfumed.
Just how a good hotel man knows
how to give you an excellent suffi
ciency of food and yet not too much
is surely an artistic triumph.
The meeting "shut up shop" In good
time so that "wifey dear" did not
have a kick coming. Good biz!
Toastmaster Clark did not allow
any "pralimbinaries" but got right
down to cases and kept it going that
way.
That benign smile tliaat W. B. Mack
wears and the fatherly watchfulness
exercised over the whole assembly
is worth going a long way to see.
Five representatives of the churches
were in attendance, thus giving the
enterprise the sanction and encourage
ment of the enlightened church and
giving emphasis to the scriptural in
junction "to be instant in business."
A few "high brows" were present
but they (lid not appear to "cut much
ice".
Some day we expect to be a million
aire editor. Then it will be our turn
to look down in a patronizing way upon
such gatherings, but just now we are
"scratching gravel."
George J. Wolff certainly added
much to the value which will accrue,
if the ideas he gave are followed out;
he argued that the proposition be made
very wide in its scope.
"Farmer" Elder on the way to the
big dinner, by heck!
The M. & M. company gave away
sample bottles of extracts.

LUNDIN IS SURE
CEREAL FIRM
VIOLATES LAW
Alfred H. Lundin, King county pros
ecuting attorney, is quoted by the
Northwestern Merchant, a Seattle
trade publication, as declaring that
selling schemes involving giving pre
miums are in violation of the anti
trading stamp and coupon law of this
state. Lundin's opinion is given in
the case of a big breakfast cereal
concern which promises housewives
an aluminum cooker valued at $2.50
providing they send 50 cents in cash
plus four trade marks from cereal
packages to the manufacturing con
cern. The Seattle trade publication
says that it will endeavor to bring
pressure enough to bear upon Lundin
to prosecute this case Immediately,
as well as all other cases in violation
of the trading stamp and coupon
statute.

REGULATES
PURCHASES
OF ALCOHOL
Council Pass Ordinance
Giving Control to
Police
PISTA GIVEN LIGHT
South Aberdeen Council
man Gets Street Lamp
After Fight.
Passage of an ordinance placing
regulation of alcohol sales in police
hands and consideration of the prob
lem involved in a request by Coun
cilman Pista for a street light in
South Aberdeen, took up large part
of a lengthy session of the city coun
cil Wednesday night.
Persons desiring to buy alcohol for
mechanical or chemical purpose, in
future, will apply to Chief of Police
R. J. Schmidt or, in his absence, to
City Clerk Peter F. Clark. Applica
tion must state quantity of alcohol
needed, purpose to which it is to be
applied and where it is to be bought.
The chief, or city clerk, then will
issue permit for purchase. State-
Perfection in Butter;
None Other So Good
Capital City Creamery Butter, the
only butter manufactured in the state
from purified and pasteurized cream
to which a pure culture is added to
give it flavor and keeping quality. It
will keep three weeks, we guarantee
that, provided it does not come into
contact with strongly flavored foods,
because our new process of purifica
tion, our uptodate equipment and fa
cilities enable us to produce butter
that has no equal, and we know it will
keep.
Furthermore, in competition with 67
creameries from seven states, exhibit
ing at the Western Dairy Products
show and conference in Spokane, C. C.
C. butter was awarded second place
with a score only one-half point lower
than the two exhibits which tied for
first place. They got 191 points out
of a possible 200 —C. C. butter got
190.5. That shows it's good butter —
there are only two creameries in the
seven western states that make any
better —and that's so very little better
that it's just a half of one point out
of a possible 200.
The weight is guaranteed, too, abso
lutely—one or two pounds net in each
carton (according to size), and when
you buy butter indiscriminately, you
never know whether you are getting
full weight or not. You don't have to
worry about that with our butter —
we weigh every carton on the best
tortion scales made—we know it's full
weight, and if there's the least bit of
doubt in your mind, we want you to
weigh it, too —that will prove it.
Hundreds of consumers use C. C. C.
Butter —they know how good it is,
they know there's none better —they
have proved its superiority. If you
are not a user, ask your grocer for it
—tell him you want to try it —com-
pare it with any other butter on the
market. We'll be satisfied then, for
we know you'll say C. C. C. is the
best.
This butter is carried by Gabrielson
& Holmer, they keep it at an even
temperature in a refrigerator so it is
always in perfect condition.
GEORGE ABEL
NEW SUPERIOR
COURT JUDGE
George D. Abel of Hoquiam was ap
pointed Wednesday as Grays Harbor
county superior court judge, to fill
the vacancy created by the death of
Judge Mason Irwin. The new judge
is aged 47 years, a native of Kansas
where he practiced law from 1892 un
til five years ago, when he came to
Hoquiam, where he has since resided.
W. H. and A. M. Abel, brothers of
Judge Abel, it is understood, are not
to practice before him.
Dark Cornlch.—Dr. E. E. Lane, Aber
deen; W. C. Kidder, Aberdeen.
Mottled Houdans. —Mrs. Freda Nel
son, Aberdeen.
Bantams.—White Cochin, A. E. Moor
house, Aberdeen.
VOLUME 30
ments of purchaser must be sworn to
before a notary, and making of falae
statements or any other violation ot
the ordinance may be punished by
maximum fine of $100, 30 days in
city jail or both fine and imprison
ment. The enactment, while pattern
ed somewhat after Hoquiani's, does
not provide for the mixture of ben
zol with the alcohol.
Councilman Pista likely will get th«
street light he has been asking for, at.
Stockwell and Mill, South Aberdeen,
for the past few months. The coun
cil Wednesday night spent three quar
ters of an hour on the problem. The
light will cost $2.25 a month to main
tain, and ways of procuring it were
left to the street committee, with
tacit understanding that some other
district will not be despoiled of a
lamp.
The ordinance providing for rebates
to property owners in the first and
second fill districts was passed. It
was decided to give Chris Endresen
5 instead of 15 years lease of the foot
of Clark street and second advertising
of the lease was ordered. Action on
West Second street's projected im
provement was laid over a week.
SHIPYARDS HUSTLE
At the Aberdeen shipyards, Andrew
Peterson & Son have started laying
the keel of the big Balfour-Guthrie
auxiliary schooner, the largest craft
ever to be built on Grays Harbor. At
the Lindstrom yards A. Schubach, lee
see, is rushing repairs preliminary to
starting to build four big ships, con
tract for the last one of which, Pree
ident A. C. Gaillac ot the Chamber o£
Commerce received word this week
from Schubach, had been secured.
Night Riders Poor
Advertisement for
North River—Martin
The Herald lias received the follow
ing communication from Charles Mar
tin of North River:
"Word has been received in Aber
deen by Mrs. M. A. Martin from At
torney Alex C. Shaw of Portland,
about the patents to the North N. E.
% of Sec. 28 and the E. % of W.
Se 2&, township 15 N., Range 6
W. W. M„ Pacific county, Wash.
"Patents of Alma DeLong and
George Wheaton .were issued from
the U, S. land office March 15.
"This will be of great interest to
law abiding citizens of the whole state,
as every unscrupulous and under
hand trick known to the legal pro
fession has been used to thwart thesa
people in attaining their just rights.
"Time, money and malicious inter
ference have been lavishly expended.
The notorious night riding episode of
the North River country'that has been
before the public for the past two
years, is but one of the many attempts
to block these people from getting
these patents.
"Forty-eight indictments were re
turned by the grand jury of Pacific
county last year in consequence o£
which the county has gotten a reputa
tion which will stick to it for many
generations, to say nothing of thou
sands of dollars expended in defend
ing this gang of night riders with the
unscrupulous attorneys who were un
doubtedly backing them.
"The railroads, business people and
large interests of the state have fi
nally come to the conclusion that the
North River valley is one of the
most valuable assets of this state and.
can no longer be held from the public*
use by a few lawless misguided pio
neers.
"A large gang of men are at work
clearing the 0.-W. line that runs into
this section of the country, which will
be connected with the Pacific county
railroads the coming year.
"With the coming of the railroads
new people, new ideas and good
schools this section of the country
i will come into its own."
