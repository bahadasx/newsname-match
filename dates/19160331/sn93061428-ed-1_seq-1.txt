.Th Carransa government will real

importation of supplies for th expe
ditionary force In Mexico, in tha event
that all of tha auppliea ihould ba

1 Cenral Funeton and his staff had
bee) ao confident that C'arranxa would
ev unqualified consent to the use of
exlean railways for sanding supplies
to tha American expedition if he gave
a favorable decision at all, that all ar
rangements were made for the use of
tha Amaricn crews in the operation
of train and tentativa arrangements
had been completed for the immediate
use of rolling stock of other railroad.
It had been hoped Carranxa would
impose no condition, but even with
tha stipulation that the supplies muMt
go as ordinary freight, the proxpert
of relieving the situation ia so great
that keen satisfaction was manifested
at army headquarters.
The line of motor trucks in oper
' atlon from Columbus, N. M., to Casas
Grandes will not be retired fromser
vice along that line of communication
until tha new arrangement is well
under way. Should there lie no hitch
In tha shipment by railroad, it Is ex
pected that Columbus soon will he
abandoned as a base.
ARMY'S EMERGENCY EXPENSE
BILL IS PASSED BY HOUSE.
Washington, D. C, March 28. An
emergency appropriation of $8,61 1,502
to pay for the added strength of the
army and the punitiva expedition elnto
Mexico, was passed by the house to-k-'
day. Representativa Meyer London of
New York, the lone Socialist member
of tha house, declared the Mexican ex
pedition was a blunder that would lead
to war, and be cast tha only dissent
ing vote.
V Former speaker Cannon declared
that whatever tha result of the Mexi
can expedition, tha country would
stand together on the question of ns-1
tional defense Republican leader!
Mann demanded a record vota on the !
bill to demonstrate that whatever was
needed for defence would be voted
without a dissenting vote.
PELON IS WHAT THEY WANT.
How the attitude of the Mexican
population at Aacenclon changed was
described as laughable by Mr. Matt
howson. Whan the troop first en
tered, he said, thsy were met with
cowl of disfavor, but soon thereaf
ter they began to spend a little money.
Then everything changed. They were
cheered, amiled at and beloved. Eggs
ad venced in price from 10 eents to
$1 a down, incidentally, ha added, and
peddlers came around in wagons to
sell their Vara to the "doughboys".
But ao long aa there was an Ameri
can dollar In eight, Villa or Carransa
were as nobody to theMexleans. There
were no scowls, no sign of hatred
the American was adored.

TWO TRWNS COLLIDE
THIRTY PERSONS DEAD AND
MANY HURT IN WRECK
NEAR CLEVELAND. OHIO.
Three Palatial Paaaenger Train Are
Piled Up in Collision; Farmers and
People Near Aaaiat. Overworked
Employe Failed to Give Signal.
One of Worst Catastrophe In niatory
of Railroad Traffic Occurs From
Company Carelessness,
Cleveland, Ohio, March 29. With
a toll of at least thirty persons dead
and forty or mora injured, federal
and state officials and officials of the
railroad companies have begun an in
vestigation into the cause which early
today led to on of the most disas
trous wrecks In the history of the
New York Centra' system.
Three trains, including the Twen
tieth Century Limited, west bound,
the New York .Central's palatial flier,
and two sections of No. 81, knnwn us
the Chicago-Pittsburg limited . east
bound, came together in collision
near Amherst, Ohio, thirty-seven
miles west of Cleveland.
A slip on the part of a dozing tow
erman was to blame for the wreck
according to A. S. Ingala, general su
perintendent of the New York Cen
tral. Ingalls, with I.. A. Robinson,
general paaaenger agent of the New
York Central, and Daniel McLunt,
superintendent of motive power of the
roau, conducted an Inquiry into the
tragedy on the part of the road of
ficials. The towerman's wife had
been, it was learned, and he hud
been without sleep on or off duty
practically since Sunday nlirhL
When the total of dead and injur-
ea is nnuliy ascertained, the wreck
will surpass, in its cost of life and
limb, even the wreck of the Twen
tieth Century, limited, at Mentor in
1004, when the famous fain piled
Into a freight on its second trip on
the New York-Chicago twenty-four
hour run.
The wreck was one of the worst
that has occurred rm t!e New York
Central system. Dense fog obscured
the signal set by the fiist section of
the east bound TitUburg-lJultimore-buffalo
limited, cuusing another sec
tion of that train to crush into it. A
short time later, beforo slgnul men
could flag it, the fust Twentieth Cen
tury limited, west bound, crashed in
to tha wreckage which had piled up
on the west bound track.
Daylight had not yet appeared
when the three fains piled up to
gether. Farmer and villager rush
ed to the assistance of the stricken
passengers. The work of rescuing
those pinioned under tha wreckage
wa hampered by darkness and fog
Ambulances, automobiles and all
kinds of vehicles were rushed from
Elyrla and other points. The little
morgue at Tmherst was soon filled.
Most of the Injured were conveyed to
hospitals at Elyria.
The twentieth Century proceeded
on its way to Chicago.
Mr. and Mr. Todd returned to their
home in Dog Canyon Friday. Mrs.
Todd cama here for treatment some
two or three weak ago and went out
to har later' on the plain for a short
visit Her niece, Bertha Mines, the
popular young Udy In Doy Canyon,
accompanied them to the A. H. Bar
ran ranch. Their little daughter,
fjWa. enjoyed tha trip vry much.
Mr. Todd wa vary much improved
In health when aha started on tha re
turn trip to tha canyon.
CROSSING THE RIO GRANDE.
In editorially discussing what we
have pleased to term our "manifest
destiny," which 'point southward to
certain territorial acquisitions essen
tial to tha safety of the United States
as the dominating power of the Wes
tern hemisphere, Colonel Henry Wat
terson, in the Louisville Courier-Journal,
says that In spite of all, the man
and the hour will come and the drums
will beat and flags WW wave just as
they did when Gibbs was hung and
Hec was a pup, and the "Star Spangl
ed Banner" meant every word it said.
Nor is it our purpose to take Issue
with Colonial Watterson. We, too,
think that tha hour will come, and
also tha man, but we doubt that the
movement across the Rio Grande, pre
cipitated by Villa, Is but the avant
courier of the future, the messenger
of the inevitable; a mile post along
the highway of progress; as it were,
a sign in the heavens. Colonel Wat
terson rightly nays, however, that
altruism may rant; but tha expanding
needs both of nationality and civilisa
tion will in the end prevail.
Tha hour hasn't arrived, neither has
the man. In due time both will ap
pear, but unfortunately wa are in the
midst of a spasm of pacifism now.
Crossing the Rio Grande means noth
ing. We captured Vera Crux,, or oc
cupied It, if you will. American ma
rines were killed and hundreds of
thousands of dollars thrown away.
Until now we know not why nor
wherefore of thi expedition. Some
of our more patriotic citisen assum
ed that we intended to punish Mexi
cans who had been disrespectful to
the Stars and Stripes, but it is of
record that Victoriano Huerta want to
hia grava without having saluted the
American flag.
Nowadays, the "Star Spangled Ban
ner" doesn't mean anything. Otn
president is too fearful that he will
hurt the feelings of the "distressed
and sensitive peopl t of Mexico." Even
now, the American troopers in Mexico

When Car ( etches Fire in a Train.
Herfeord, Texas, Mar. 28. When
the car in which they were being
.shipped caught fire a few miles out
from Jowell switch, three registered
Hereford bulla belonging to Jowell &
Jowell, were burned to death.
Tha bulls were loaded at Jowell
switch, four miles east of here. The
train hud proceeded but a few miles
when trainmen discovered the car was
on fire. The fire hud gained such
headway that the trainmen hud diffi
culty, because of the heat, in cutting
the car loose from tlie truin.
It was found impossible to liberate
the bulls and they were burned with
the car. The car was close to the en
gine and it is believed sparks from the
engine set fire to straw in the car.

are on short rations because Don Ven
uetlano dislike to turn over the rail
road to us, and wa couldn't think of
offending him. And yet the American
people resldentedn Mexin and along
the border have been sorely distressed,
too. But what consideration has been
shown them by the president?
N. crossing tha Rio Grande means
nothing. Neither the hour, nor rhs
man, has arrived. When tha sympa
thy of him who is sworn to uphold
the rights of American c'.tixens in
foreign lands Is with the people of
alien birth, there cannot be much
headway made by the American gov
ernment. Here in El Paso, we have
asked for a sufficient number of troops
to insure us against the possiblity of
Mexican aggressiveness and we are
told that the "cabinet" doesn't think
there is any danger. Yet the "cabi
net" didn't think Columbus would be
attacked, either. Otherwise, the "cab
inet" would have fortified the town,
or an effort would have been made to
negotiate with Villa. There is no way
of telling, for didn't w first beg leave
of Don Venustisno before pursuing
the murderous ruffians.
To make matters worse, the presi
dent not only characterises those of
Mexico and the borderland who would
tell him something of Mexico as liars,
but appeal to th American people
to discredit newspaper stories from
Mexico or the borderland. No, th
crossing of the Rio Grande means
nothing. But tha American people
will be inclined to agree with Colonel
Watterson, that the man and tha hour
will come, and that drums will beat
and flags will wave and tha Star
Spangled Banner will mean every
word it says. Pacifism must have
ita day, though, and right now tha
pacifists are in the ascendency. In
the meantime, wa can but urge the
American people to remember Santa
Ysabe! and not forgot Columbus. El

ROUND HOUSE FOR
FIVE LOCOMOTIVES
IN CARLSBAD
WILLCQST $42,607 AND EM
PLOY A NUMBER OF MEN
For several years past the Santa F
ha kept a machinist and helper in
Calrsbad to rook after the locomotives
used at thia end of the Pecos Valley
line and the question of better facil
ities for the care and repair of the
motiv power used at this terminal
haa been under consideration. Now
the following is given out aa official by
Mr. Hove who is "next" to all tha la
test in railway matters, being publi
city man for the Santa F in tha Pe
cos Valley and adjacent territory:
A five stall roundhouse, cinder pit.
and a hundred ton coal chut will ba
built at the Carlsbad Terminal at a
cost Of $42,607.00. So announce F. .
t. Fox, general manager of tha we,
tern lines of the Santo Fe aytem,
with headquarters at marido. Th
construction will start in the near
future.
This Is good news to Carrsbad.
It is the biggest single Improvement
aince the building or the $o0,000.M
addition to tha court house, complete)
two years ago. The railway, improve,
ment and the $17,600.00 armory new
building, will set a pace for the ad
vancement of Carlsbad this season.
The Santa Fe is spending nearly
$100,000.00 on the improvement of the
Pecos Valley lines otherwise. Steel
gangs are now at work, laying heavy
steel. Ten miles have already beea
finished north from the bridge arrasa
the Pecos River above Roswell. If
things in the railroad world continue
fairly satisfactory, by the end af -the
year heavy steel will have been
laid aa far south as Roswell at least.
When the Valley lines were built
in the early nineties, the country was
new and its future undetermined.
Hence the road wus built as cheaply
as possible. The cuts und embank
ments were narrow. These will be
mude standard this season at an
estimated cost of about $10,000.00.
The Santa Fe is following a policy
of late to apply much of the net
earnings every year to betterments
of the system. Under the manage
ment of E. P. Ripley, the president,
the Sania Fe is conducted as a plain
liusintwH proposition. The railroad
bus transportation to sell und better
service naturally increases business.
Therefore truck und equipment re
ceive rontsunt uttenlion for one thing
und betterments of the system mud
for another.
Though the Pecos Vulley lines huve
been gradiiully improved, this is the
lurgest single appropriation mude any
one year for track betterment. Th
advance the Pecos Vulley is muking
along better lines with live stock aa
un important fat-tor In agriculture,
is being noticed by Suntu he officials
uml the big road responds to the new
condition by bettering its truck. A
yeur ugo it will be remembered the
train service wus materially increas
ed. In this connection it may bp noted
thut the Suntu Fc titkos pride even
in tho looks of things. Every HaU
urday the section crews spend the day
in cleuning up tho yard over the sys
tem. Thu Curlsbud yud; lire always
neat und clean. The laiUcts at the
station has hud much niti-iition this
spring und is already i. In .miy spot.
A hedge is started on tne sidd
und beds of ull sort of flow, 4 have
been planted. Agent T. . ("rnson
uml pumper J. I'. il.n' :u- IV ur
tists. Hack aeróos tin i.it A. J.
Muzzy is following the ( Sample. Thi
civic pride, shown by tin . .int.i Fe,
is worth noting und f.illo.nnr.
There is only one cloud ii' sight,
tlio feur of a geiie.nl .tiike by the
train service men on ull tho mud in
the United States. The trainmen de
mand un eight hour day and time and
u half for overtime. Shuuld this de
mand of the 1011,174 trainmen ba
gruntod, the operating cost of the rail
roads would increase $100,000,000.00
a year. Such an increase in expenses
without corresponding increase of in
come, would very likely stop further
outluy for this season for betterments
even among the stronger rouds. Only
the most necessary things would b
done.
There ar no strings to th im
provements ordered at the Carlsbad
torminal. Th Santa Fa decided to
build and to build well a the esti
mated cost of $42,n07.00 indicate.
At the same time this improvement
should stimulate improvement both of
Carlsbad and tha Carlsbad proWt.
The improvements made by tha Pub
lie Utilities Company should also help
add to tha spirit of progress in th
Carlsbad country. With bettor light
and power service, substantial railway
terminal, and . improvement of tha
entire valley Una, this section to e
of th pioneer stags and ready to
advance rapidly.
