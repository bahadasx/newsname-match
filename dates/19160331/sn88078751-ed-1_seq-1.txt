Place The
Thirty Dead And
Cleveland, March 30. With a total
of at least thirty persons dead and
forty or more injured, federal and
state officials and officials of the rail
road company began au Investigation
Into the cntiso that led to one of the
most disastrous wrecks that have oc
curred In this ctato in a dozen years
aud one of the worst In the history of
tho New York Central system.
Threo trains, including the Twen
tieth Century limited, westbound, the
Now York Central's palatial flyer, and
two seel Ions of No. 86, known as the
Chicago-Pittsburgh limited, eastbound,
camo together in co'lislon near Am
herst, thirty-seven miles from Clove
land.
Reports generally credited wer'e
that the first and second sections of
No. SO were proceeding at a rapid
rate ami at some points were only a
mile or so apart. When the second
secUou crashed into the first section,
the Twentieth Century plowed lute
the wreckage of the other trains
which bulged over from the parallel
tracks, ard tho three were thrown
into an indescribable mass.
The great coaches and engines ot
No. 8C toppled over and wreckage, was
piled 30 feet In tho air, T.VO cars
were smashed to unk. Fourteen
coaches overturned.
Tho Twentieth Century, notwith
standing its Impact with tho debris
from the other trains, was not greatly
damaged and soon resumed its west
ward Journey, Its passengers were
sot injured, except for a severe shak
ing up.
Occurred In Fofl.
A pall of fog from Lake Erie had
aettlod down over northern Ohio and
the night was almost of inky dark-,
aeas. This, with tho alleged failure,
of a towcrman to do his duty under
tho rules, was ascribed by somooj
the railroad officials us tho cause of
tho wreck. Tho towerman, it was
said, had been without sleep most of
the time since Sunday night, his wiro
being 111 and requiring his attention
when he was not on duty.
Scones of terrible confusion follow
od the crush. Many of tho injured,
pinioned in the wrockagc, called pit
cously for help as uninjured passen
gers, half clad, quickly emerged from
tho sleepers and Joined with train
men and others in the rescue work.
A bonfire from some of the wreckage
brought the first rays of light on the
scone of desolation and death. Fire
men from Amherst wore among tho
first to arrive, and they soon succeed
ed In quenching the flames.
The fire was in the ono wooden
coach on train No. 86, now known as
tie "death coach," bocauso of the fact
that most ot fie casualties occurred
in it
Tho wreck occurred shortly after 3
a. m., and it was nearly 4 o'clock
when something like organised relier
work was established.
Did Heroic Work.
Hospital trains wero run from Cleve
land. Elyria and Lorain to the scene
of the wreck and physicians and am
bulances were rushed from all of
these points. Hundreds of villagers
and farmers from Amherst and vicin
ity did horolc work in caring for the
dead, dying and Injured, Tho little
morgue at Amherst was quickly filled,
but other buildings were made avail
able to tho dead, most of them man
gled beyond recognition and some of
them so far that identification
may novor bo established. Private
homes wero' also thrown open and

"The rear car of first No. 86, which

SPEED SAVED LIMITED
Frevented a Much Larger List of
Dead, Say Passengers. -
Chicago, March 30. The high speed
of the Twentieth Century limited, one
if tho three trams in the disastrous
wreck at Amliorst, O., provented a
much larger death list than that re
ported, In the opinion of passengers
on tho westbound train who reached
Chicago. The train plowed through
the mass of wreckage and human
bodies and literally ground the bodies
to pieces, tho passengers said in re
lating thrilling stories of narrow es
capes in the smashup.
"There was no fog so far as I could
see," said Henry P. Runkol, director
of the Oorman-Austro-Hungarlan Re
lief society. "Only the terrific speed
of the Century got us through. We
tore through the wreckage. Never
have I seen such a ghastly sight as
that pestnted when I got out of our
coach. It reminded me of battlefields
ir Europe I have recently seen. We
went promptly to the rescue."

struction of a government armor plate

it as the sense of the caucus that it
favored the principle of government
ownership, was defeated. A substi
tute proposed by Representative Gar

tions, was adopted by unanimous vote.

jpn
Is Honored By General Car
ranza United States May Use Mexican
Northwestern Railroad,
TO CARRY SUPPLIES TO TROOPS
Head of the De Facto Government
Finally Agrees to the Use of the
Mexican Line For Commercial Pur
poses Army Officers Relieved of
Necessity of Maintaining a Motor
Truck Supply Line.
Washington, March 30. General
Car ranza has granted the renewed re
quest of the state department for per
mission to use the Mexican North
western railroad in carrying out the
pursuit of Villa and nis band.
General Carranza's answer was con
tained in a brief message from J. Linn
Rodgers, special agent of tho United
States at Queretaro, saying tho head
o- the de facto government agreed to
the commercial use of the line. Offi
cials here assumed he would be equal
ly prompt in notifying his officers on
tho border and that General Funstou.
might begin shipment of supplies at
once.
Although the army will proceed to
use the railroad on a commercial
basis, which is construed here as
meaning that all service shall be paid,
for at regular rates, the state depart
ment will negotiate further with Car
ranza to bring about a more complete:
understanding as to just what he has
agreed to.
Carranza's response is regarded as
leing sarjsfactory in a measure, but
It is not sufficiently definite. It may
be, too, that in order to assure the ar
rival and delivery of supplies snipped
to points along the line. General
Funston will desire to place guards on
the trains.
War department officials were
greatly relieved by the removal of the
necessity for maintaining a motor
truck supply line over desert road3
for a distance of more than 200 miles.
While the physical condition of the -Mexican
Northwestern Is not good,
many bridges having been destroyed
durinrr the Tears of revolution In Mex
ico, army engineers should have litila
difficulty in keeping it open.
Aside from the railroad problem, de
tails of the protocol suggested-by Gen
eral Carraaza remain to lie worked,
cut through diplomatic channuls.
State department officials indicate,
however, that there is no reason for
haste in this connection.
