problem of forwarding supplies to

by way of the Mexico Northwestern
niilroad has changed from the per

One of the wicrdest tales peddled'
among the newspaper men here was,
proinptlv nailed by the police today,
when thev arrested Kduardo Perez, I
the father of the yarn, as a vagrant.
Perez had a marvelous story of hisj
adventures, which invluded an ae-

lumbits and was now in hiding on a ,
ranch three miles from the border, j
He confi-ssed the laiuuauon lle,.
