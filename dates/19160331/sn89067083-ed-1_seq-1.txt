. Whooping Cough.
Famished by the Department of Pre-
. Ulstouri, Columbia, Mo,
Whooping cough derives its
name from the peouliar inspira
tory whoop following a paroxysm
of ooughlng, The disease occurs
in extensive epidemios, apparen
tly uninfluenced by weather or
season, al though its epidemios
are most severe and frequent in
oold climates, Apparently it is
a disease of fairly modern origin.
At le&t we do hot find it certain
ly described by anoient writers.
It isoaused by a small germ
whioh is thrown out in the act of
ooughing, consequently it Is
spread most often by direct oon
taot of one child with another.
The germ may, however, be oar-
ried. from one person to another
by handkerchiefs, toys, drinking
oups, roller towels and other ob-
jeota whioh beoome infejted with
the seoretions of the respiratory
traot. It is said that some of the
lower animals, particularly the
doc. are oooasionally infected
with whooping cough, and the
disease may be spread in this
manner. It is oontagious from
the appearanoe of the earliest
ivmDtoms. and the daneer of
contagion is greater during th
er r ' w
early stages, although it exists
throughout the disease and dur
Inz oonvaleeoenoe. After expo
sure, a period of from one to two
weeks elapses before the appear
anoe of symptoms.
People generally do not realize
the dangerous charaoter o f
whopping cough. The death rate
in the United States is about 10,
000 a year more than scarlet
fever. It is particularly dancer
ous to children under 3 years of
age and to those who are tuber
oulcus.
The principles of prevention
are simple. Sinoe the disease is
spread entirely by the secretions
from the respiratory tract, pre
vention consists in keeping other
ahildren from coining in contact
with these. Isolation of patients
is necessary. Toys, handker
chiefs, etc., should not be passed
from a eiok child to well ones.
Siok children should not be al
lowed to go to sohool, theaters or
publio assemblies of any sort.
Owing to the long duration of an
attack of whooping cough and
the faot that ohildren are seldom
ill enough to be confined to bed,
isolation is particularly hard to
oarry out. An abundance of
fresh air helps in the treatment
and there is no objection to ohild
ren going out provided they are
in 'the care of an intelligent per
son who will prevent oontaot with
well, children. In some cities,
the wearing of an arm-band mar
ked "whooping cough" has been
tried with apparent good results.
This prevents other ohildren from
coming in close oontaot with siok
ones. The closer the oontaot,
the greater the danger.
A vaocine made from the germ
is quite extensively empioyea.
From three to four injections are
given, and in a great majority of
oases, according to reports, ibe
disease is prevented. The same
vaccine is used for treatment with
extremely good results. While
tho matter is not yet ooneidered
settled, no harm can come from
tho use of the vaocine, and it has
produced suoh favorable results
wherever tried, that its use is to
be recommended, especially since
no other satisfactory form of
treatment has yet been devised.
While certain drugs apparently
have a favorable influence, none
has been found which will stop
the attack, and muoh harm is of
ten done by too much drugging.
Plowing Under Weeds And
tfrass.
M. F. Miller, Missouri Agricultural
Experiment Station.
The large amount of rainfall
last seaaon resulted in an exces
sive growth of weeds and fall
grasses in many parts of the
country and farmers are now
confronted with the problem of
turning under this large growth
of dry material. The difficulties
enoountered will undoubtedly
lead a good many of them to re
sort to burning. The great need
of most corn belt soils for organ
ic matter makes it highly unde
sirable (0 burn off anything
where it can be avoided, except
occasionally on local areas for
controlling inseots. Organic
matter is the great need of many
soils, as shown by analyses made
at the Missouri Agricultural Ex
periment Station, and if this large
growth oould be satisfactorily
turned under at this time it would
be of great value to the land.
The difficulties in plowing un
der Bre two: first, where the
oovering is mainly of grass whioh
lies closely to the ground the soil
dries out so slowly as to throw
plowing late. 8eoond, it is very
difficult to turn under this mater
ial and incorporate it thoroly with
the soil. There is no entirely
satisfactory way of drying out
the land if the eoil is very heavy
and the layer of dry grass is very
thick exoeptby burning it off but
it should bo understood tnai
burning is the last resort. It
might even pay better in such
oases to plow late ana seea 10
soybeans or oowpeas rather than
attempt to prepare the land for
oorn. The problem of turning
under this material oan largely
be solved by thjro disking as
soon as the land is dry enough.
There are doubtless extreme cases
where this oannot well be done,
but as a generul rule the use of a
sharp, weigi ted disk will aid
very greatly in preparing this
material for plowing under. Far
mers are using the disk before
plowing and this is a case where
its use becomes of greater impor
tance than usual.
In ease the land does not dry
early enough to allow the plow
ing under of this material before
the latter part of April in Central
Missouri the disk must certainly
be ua?d to aid in incorporating
the organio matter with the soil.
A large amount of dry material
plowed into land late would be
injurious to the Immediate crop,
in spite of the faot that it might
be benifiolal to the soil in the
lone run. By the use of a eharp
disk one should be able to save
this organio material for the eoil
&nd at the same lime prepare a
thoro seed bed for the immediate
crop, exoept in the most extreme
oases.
Bitter Milk.
Milk is especially likely to be
bitter in the spring, but this
trouble may appear at any time.
It is almost sure to result from
(1) eating the last remaining
wee 3s in closely grazed pastures,
(2) bad health of the cow, or (3)
the growth of baoteria in milk.
The cure in eaoh ease consists in
finding and removing the cause
and aucB-estions for doing this
are made by Percy Werner, Jr.
of the Missouri College of Agri
culture. '
oe -
It the milk becomes bitter after
standing it is not the oow's fault,
hut results frcm the erowth cf
baoteria brought in by particles
of dirt or manure or left in im
nroperlv cleaned vessels. If the
milk of all the cows in the herd

Sour Soil.
Sour Soils are often recognized
by the weeds found growing on
them. One of the most oommon ,
weeds in meadows and pastures
that have beoome acid or sour is
Red Sorrel. Complaint is often
made that red sorrel is killing tho
red olover. Sorrel will grow on
limed soils but is not able to com
pete with other plants or weeds.
In the sour field the clover died
from a laok of lime and then the
red sorrel oooupies the land. Red
Sorrel is not to be confused with
sheep sorrel that has pink blos
soms, bulbous roots from whioh
oover all the leaves. The leaves
are in three parts arranged at the
top of the leaf stalk. Red sorrel
has small, inoonspioious flowers,
long narrow leaves, shaped some
what like a spear head, and
spreads both by runners and
Beeds. The ripened seed stalks
are quite prominent and give the
plant its name.
Door weed is another common
weed on sour land. This plant io
the flat, carpet-like weed found
growing along paths and in door
yards. It Is usually covered with
a white mildew. On soil becom
ing sour it appears in great abun
dance. Common plantin and
horsetail rush also indioate sour
land.
Some crops that grow in South
east Missouri and are adapted to
soils are oow peas, red top, water
melons, strawberries, vetch, po-'
tatoes, sweet potatoes and buok
wheat. Some field crops injured hy
eour soils are alfalfa, timothy,
blue grass, corn, sorghum, red
clover and pea nuts. Some gar
den crops injured by sour soils
are peppers, pumpkin, beets, col
ery, oabbage, onion, okra and
egg plant.' More complete lists
of plants oan be found ir Far

probably at fault and the bitter
taste will probably disappear if
the oows are kept in a lot where
they cannot get at weeds. This
will give the pastures a better
ohanoe to get a good start. If
only one or a few of the oows
give hitter milk it is probably be
cause they are in bad health or
going dry, and their milk should
be kept away from the rest so
that it will not spoil the whole
mHking.
