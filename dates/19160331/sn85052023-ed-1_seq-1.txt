Three Grand Lodge Officers Attend
Convention Thursday List of
the Delegates.
Diadem Lodge No. 81, Knights of
Pythias, gave the Sir Knights of this
district handsome and sopitable wel
come when they met here in annual
-convention Thursday. The Stanford
K. P. boys were never known to jdo
things by halves, and their entertain
ment of the district body was provid
ed in the usual fine style.
Grand Chancellor R. A. Young, of
Winchester, Grand Keeper of Rec
ords and Seal, J. W. Carter,. of Lex
ington, and Superintendent of the
Widows' and Orphans' Home M. G.
Moore, of Lexington, were the grand
lodge officers who honored the dis
trict convention with their presence,
as did District Deputy Hon. J. R.
Dorman, of Nicholasville.
About a hundred delegates were
present from the various lodges of
the district, and all were made to
feel that they were welcome. The
business men and members of the
Camber of Commerce co-operated
in every way possible with the local
knights in greeting and entertaining
the guests, most of whom came by
automobile. About a hundred were
present, and all seemed to enjoy
themselves and appreciate the hospi
tality of Stanford, and Diadem lodge.
Formal lodge and business sessions
were held in the castle hall of Dia
dem lodge in the afternoon and again
in the evening. Addresses to the
knights were made by the grand lodge
officers here. In the evening after
lodge work had been exemplified, the
members all adjourned to the opera
house where the moving picture
scenes of the Widows' and Orphans'
home at Lexington were shown to
large crowds in addition to the reg
ular fine Paramount program. Af
terward, a supper was served to the
, visitors at The Princess, which wound
up a day full of good things for the
visitors, who departed with loud
praises of appreciation for Stanford
and her people.

mal sessions, showed the following

DR. DARLINGTON HONORED
Husband of Stanford Girl Heads Big
Methodist College.
Much interest has been caused
here and elsewhere in Kentucky over
the announcement in the Hunting
ton W. Va., papers that Rev. U. V.
W. Darlington, has been elected
president of Morris-Harvey College
at Barbourville, W. Va. Dr. Dar
lington married Miss Virginia Bourne
of Stanford, and has a great many
warm friends and admirers in Ken
tucky, his native state. The Herald
Dispatch, of Huntington, in telling of
the matter said in part:
"This is an announcement which
will create a degree of surprise which
will amount to a sensation in the
bounds of the Western Virginia Con-
f erence of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, South, in which there is
any other clergyman so well known
as Dr. Darlington. The new president
has for the last three years devoted
his energies to the uppu'iding of
Morris Harvey College, the official
educational institution of the Con
ference. When he concluded a pas
torate of four years at Johnson Me
morial Church he accepted the post
of Conference Secretary of Educa
tion. He held this post, a year and
the second year performed the du
ties in connection with those of pre
siding elder of Ashland district.. Dur
ing the present year his attention is
being engrossed by the duties of the
secretaryship. During these years
he has done substantial work toward
the creation of a $100,000 endow
ment fund for Morris Harvey, while
this year, through a campaign for
one dollar subscriptions he hz prac
tically lifted the floating debt, of the
institution.
U. V. W. Darlington was Lorn in
Shelby county, Kentucky, August 3,
1870. He was educated in the com
mon schools of his native county and
at Kentucky Wesleyan College where
he was prepared for the ministry.
He was admitted to the Kentucky
Conference of the Methodist Episco
pal Church, South, in 1896 and was
made pastor of East Maysville and
Washington Stations. His next sta
tion was Millersburg, where he spent
one year.
The next year he went to Coving
ton, his, first important station,
where he spent four years, thereafter
transfering to the Western Virginia
Conference to be pastor of the First
Church at Parkersburg.
After Parkersburg he came to
Huntington to be pastor of John
son Memorial church. It was under
the inspiration of his leadership that
the church erected its present mag
nificent edifice. No pastor who has
served in Huntington has been more
deeply loved by his own people than
was he few if any have achieved
.suchpopularityi-xwithoutt the bonAds
of his denomination. He has con
tinued to live in Huntington and is
loved and admired by hundreds of
people. No selection which could
have been made in the matter of the
presidency of Morris Harvey could
have been more popular than this
bids fair to prove. Dr. Darlington
was given his degree, Doctor of Di
vinity, by his alma mater, Kentucky
Wesleyan, two years ago."

NICHOLASVILLE POST-OFFICE
To Be Filled In April by Democrat
Applicant Was Here
Among the visiting K. P.'s here for
the convention Tuesday was David
Bell, a prominent business man of
Nicholasville, who is one of the two
contending applicants for appoint
ment as Postmaster of Nicholasville.
The term of the present republican
incumbent expires in April, and Con
gressman Helm is expected to make
a recommendation at once to fill the
place with a democrat, as the repub
lican has held on three years under
a democratic administration and the
democratic applicants for the place
are hungry for the "pie." Mr. Bell's
opponent for the place is Editor
James Stears, of the Nicholasville
News, who is said to be expecting
Congressman Helm's endorsement.
The fact that one of the chief back
ers of Mr. Bell for the place, how
ever, is Bob Hunter, who has led
Congressman Helm's fight, in Jessa
mine county for a number of years,
is said to make Mr. Bell believe that
he has a royal chance for the ap
pointment. Mr. Hunter was here at
the convention also, but had nothing
to say for publication regarding the
postmastership fight at Nicholasville.
His friends intimated however, that
he has no doubt of the appointment
of Bell, declaring that Hunter has had
assurances for some length of time
which leave no question of where the
appointment will go.
IT'S NO REFLECTION ON YOU
It is po reflection upon a single
subscriber to the I. J. that, it is ask
ing each and every one of them to
pay in advance for their subscrip
tions. The I. J. is compelled to take
this step simply because of the enor
mously fncreasing cost of white pnia
paper. The I. J. knows that each and
every name on its list, is good for that
dollar whether paid at the beginning
or the end of the year and the fact
that, it is stopping the paper of those
who have not paid for a year in ad
vance is no reflection upon a single
one of them whatsoever. It is sim
ply a business matter, pure and sim
ple. The daily papei' ind maga
zines all follow the same policy of
stopping a subscriber's paper when
the time is up, unless paid in advance
for another year and the I. J. is com
pelled to operate on the same plan in
the future. Better look on your la
bel and see how you stand so as not
to miss a single issue.
MEADORS TURNS UP.

week ago, and decided to make the
southern trip. He neglected to no
tify those at home of his plans.
DUNCAN
Our well-known merchant, Mr. E.
P. Claypool, or better known as Ed,
is again on his feet. He has im
proved considerably since our last
letter to the I. J.
The farming is now being conduct
ed rather hastily in this section, as
the weather seems so uncertain, the
farmers seem to want to make things
happen while time is flying.
Virgle and Ethel Thompson, were
guests of Eugene and Tom Meade, a
few hours on Friday last.
Misses Bessie and Lucille Reynolds
of Kings Mountain, were present at

day evening.
Misses Belle Griffith and Rozella
Foley, were guests of Miss Addie

must be on a trade of some kind as
he is a visitor there quite often. k It
is not a day for trading, but by the
way, Mr. Doan has a very attractive
daughter, which probably accounts
for it all.
Misses Delia and Ida Napier were

hope it won't prove fatal.

General News Notes
Carranza's agreement, for "com
mercial" use of the Mexican North
western railway for transportation
of supplies to the American expedi
tion hunting Villa is not satisfactory
to the United States, it is said, but
shipments will be attempted under
the rules prescribed, and no effort
is to be made at present for further
agreement. It is reported that no
train has left Juarez in two days, and
the problem is now regarded as mys
terious. The anxiety of the Washington
Administration in the delicate situa
tion which has arisen due to the at
tacks on several unarmed merchant
men was increased yesterday when
no word was received either directly
fronrBerlin or from Ambassador Ge
rard. It is supposed that the Ger
man Government is awaiting reports
from all -of its submarine command
ers before accepting responsibility
for the Sussex disaster or the attacks
on the Englishman and Manchester
Engineer.
