, ' . ' a, . r,
red request ot tho State Depart-
ruiowed
niont for permisfien to use mo ,u

ing, out tho pu'-srlt.
Gen. Carranza received the new re
quest this morning; his nnswer was
Jn Washington boforo dark. It was
nntnlned in a brief mesago from
. if . 1
Ti. 1 i,i.., .noMni nirnnt of the
tlUUli J W4B-io .. .D.
United States at Quorctaro, saying
tho head of tho do facto Government
agreed to tho commercial use of tho
line. Officials here assumed ho would
.be equally prompt in notifying his
Officers on the border that Gen. Funs
ion might begin shipment tomorrow.
Further Negotiations,
Although tho army will proceed to
-use tho railroad on a
commercial
Jjasls. which Is constructed hero as
meaning that nil service shall bo paid
lor at regular rates, the Stato De
partment will negotiate further with
Carranza to bring about a more com
plete understanding as to Just what
he has agreed to, Today's response
Is regarded as being satlBfuctoryiMn a-l
measure, but it Is not sufficiently do-1
finite. It may be, too, that In order ,
" to assure the arrival and delivery of '
'supplies shipped fo points along the
line Gen. Funston will desire to place
guards on the trains.
War Department officials were'
greatly relieved by tho removal of
tho necessity for maintaining a motor ,
truck supply line ovor desert roads
for a distance of moro than 200 mile.
A cloudburst or great sto'rin might
render the roads Impassablo for a
considerable spaco of time, cutting
off tho troops from their source of
supplies at the border. I
Secretary Buker issued this state
ment at the War Department tonight:
"Wo have directed Gen. Funston
to tender for railroad shipment car
goes of supplies, cither directly to our
military men or to civilians In Mex-
lco. This does not involve any tend
er of munitions for such railroad

Modest males and timid teachers

in the language of tho collego author

They have been cut entirely too low
from tho chin and too high from tho

in Attire," tho university faculty has
established a censorship ot clothes,
and Miss Roby Mason, Dean ot Wom
en, Is attending all dances and In
specting frocks.
Girl students' dresses must come
up to tho mark, the dean declares,
though 6he probably means that they
must not go beyond It. "The mark"
appears to be an tmaglnnry lino a
few Inches above tho shoetops, but
not too many Inches. Its exact lati
tude and longitude have not been
rylven out for publication. It tho
frocks come abovo this imaginary
Troplo ot Caplcorn, some distance
south ot the Equator, the wearers
must go bnck to their rooms and

COMMISSION FOR

FOUR MEN TO LOOK AF
TER EXPENDITURE.
TWO FROM EACH PARTY
Jno. II. Bnrnes, W. T. Keown, Rowan'
Holbrook and W. S. Tlnsley Se
lected to Act If Bonds Carry.
The Ohio County Fiscal Court met
In adjourned session In the court
house here Monday, afternoon and
about tho most Important business
transacted was the election ot a
commission to handle the $300,000
goad roads fund If a majority votes
for It In May. Without a dissenting .
voice the court decided to place this
money, If voted, In the hands of men
whom they believe more able than
themselves to make every dollar do
Its work. Jno. H. Barnes, Demo
crat; W. T. Keown, Republican;
Rowan Holbrook, Democrat; and W.
S. Tlnsley, Republican; were ap
pointed on this committee. There
Is a possibility that two more names
will be added to this commission la
ter. Two of the men named on the com
mission are bankers of high standing
and the other two are men who have
had experience In handling large
sums of money. It Is believed that
the court made a wise selection, but
there would be no objection to two
more names being added to the list
making a total of six. If that is
done Mr. Alvln Rowe, of the Farm
ers Bank, of Centertown, Is sure to
be one of them, and his appointment
would meet with popular approval.
The other commissioner would llke-
jfcsbe selected from another part of
tho county.
The primary object of this session
of the court was to 'hear tho report
of the survey of the road to be con
structed toward Cromwell, but the .

were working frantically to recover
more dead and injured from the
wrecking of three of the New York
Central's fastest and finest trains,
which were demolished in a double
wreck at Amherst at 4 o'clock this
morning.
Relief trains have been sent to the

gether he killed tea blacksnakes,
some ot them being fully five feet la
length. This is the first bunch of
