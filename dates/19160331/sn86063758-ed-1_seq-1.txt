I To the Editor of The Herald and
News:
1 wish to direct attention to the
\r>n t^rrv Piihlir TJhrarv and if in
doing so I pppear to sco'd other persons?
1 wish it known thai I take to
myself more blame than I impute to
all the rest oi the community. During
the whole of the ten years since my
return home after my sojourn in Green
wood, I have neglected, until a few
weeks ago, to subscribe to the library,
or have anything to do with it. I am
heartily sorry ifor this bad behavior,
and it is largely in consequence of
my contrition and to make some
amends, that I write as I now do.
^ The benevolence of Hon. George S.
Mower in giving a room, or. if desired,
two rooms, for the use of the library,
and the courageous and persevering
effort of some of our ladies, are about
all that has kept the enterprise alive
and going. But the number of patrons
is so small that the ladies have not
* t 4.1
had the means to purcnase many wwks
which they desire to have, or to obtain
such furnishing for the room as
they would wish, and ought to have.
Yet they have kept heart and hope,
buying such books as thev could
opening the library three times every
week, and in turn, and without pay,
" fnn/ ? {/%no lihrnv.
pen.urmiiig an mc 1UUVUUUO V/4. V V?.
^ ian?and never begging help. By this
persistent exertion they have accumulated
about fifteen hundred volumes. t
and furnished a good deal of good
reading to those who have ibeen wise
enough to avail themselves of the opportunity.
And during all their discouraging
struggle we men, with fe*
exceptions, have stood alooi. The
women seem to have about threefourths
of tre public spirit in New*
berry, and about the same proportion
#>nerev. These library ladies, the
-Bachelor maids, the Civic association,,
the United Daughters of the Confederacy,
and the various women's char-j
itable and literary societies, are doing
I suspect, ten times as much for the
welfare of tlie community as all the
men put together. I need not mention
their church work; everybody knows
L that they keep all the churches go
^ ins. {
Now the cost of subscription to the
library is only one dollar per year. A
subscriber is allowed to tafce out two
volumes at the same time, and to keep
them two weeks with the privilege o.
mnewal. Many a one of ais pays mora
than a dollar for a copy of such trash
a6 eRd Pottage or V. V.'s Eyes, while
tor a dollar we could read urom the
library, The Seige of the Seven Suit
crs, and The Stranger, ana twenty
more rational, clean books. And there
i
are there a good many 'books besides.
novels?encyclopedias, histories, biographies,
essays, etc. I found there,
the other day, a valuable historical
work which I hr.ve never seen elsewhere.
The population of the town of
Greenwood is very little larger than
that of Newberry, and her wealth is
oortainly no greater than ours; yet
there they have a library of about
twenty-five hundred volumes; they
pay their librarian, and they are worKing
and expect to secifre a Carnegie
* building on the lot lately donated by
the town, which will be upon their assuring
$2,000 annually for the sustenance
of the library I doubt that
* ?:ur library has received $:\000 during
the whole thirteen years of its exist!
ence.
Since the arousing o the Southern
people fnm their long lethargy ot"
illiteracy it is hardly necessary to
rorcind anyone that books are the
k store-house and treasuries of know'
rdge; the seminaries o" sound thought,
pure sentiment, and refined taste; the
best companions in our solitude; our
teachers and comforters in distress; j
and most efficient in keeping boys j
from vice and girls from frivolous
tomfoolery. Every one who has the
general welfare at heart should t>e
anxious to put good books within easy
reach of the people.
The municipal authorities should
appropriate some money for the sujj^
nnrt nf thi* enterprise, recosrnizins: it
rus beneficial to the people of the
town; and, as I urged years ago, the
county authorities should allow it
quarters in the old court house, as
ii e\ have done \vis?.ly and patrioticlly
:.or the Rest Room. But our citizens
ought not to wait for, or depend upon
V~ I
public help. They should rally to the 1
assistance of the public-spirited ladies
who have worked .so long amid dis
couragemeilis, especiauj oiucc ctci;
subscriber will derive, for himself as
for his family, or for both, a benefit i
of far greater ivalue than the little one j
dollar of vearly cost. We i^liall have I
l
to suffer, and to take a back seat, and j
to be prodded, and argued with and;
entreated, and made a jest of by j
neighboring towns for a good while,
before we shall acquire such an appreciation
of public benefits as Greenwood
is blessed with, but surely this
town, of nearly six thousand inhabitants.
whose four banks hold deposits
of more than a million dollars, which j
has three flourishing cotton mills, a i
i
fine college, and first rate schools?j
surely this town has scores of men!
and women who can give without)
missing it, the poor, little, pitiful one i
dollar a year for subscription to so |
worthy an enterprise as trie ruunc
Library. I believe that many Ol them
will subscribe when they come to
think about it. But they need to be i
reminded of the matter?just as 1
did.

STATE SlTT. SWEARIXGES 1<
VISITS SEWBERRY SCHOOLS a
w
It was our good fortune as well as u
pleasure to visit four of the schools h
if :he county during the week in com- w
panv with Mr. J. E. Swearingen, State s<
.superintendent of education. and
County Superintendent C. P. Barre. M
We have always taken an interest. T
in the schools, but liaving served as s;
cauiiiy superiiueuuein 01 euu^uuun tu( j ^
\ brief period, and having had a little
to do with arousing the school spirit ?r
and the awakening of *ie people in ft
the cause o' better schools, we haveMs
~ 1 1 - ^ _ 1* I
uj^o iuiii an itwa??nins; on uie suujeci.
The schools at .Tolly Street and
Silver-street and Chappells especially hi
took on new life and 1)11111 new school
houses and increased their teaching 01
force under our brief administration n<
and it is espccally pleasant to visit crhen1
and to see thac the school spirit m
is still alive and the interest unabated. ci
All three of these districts had pi?c- n:
tically no buildings and in one we w
? ? i ? 4. ? ,1 ii, ^ ? j rh

the work in the others.
On Monday $ight there was a meet- t
ing at Jolly Street in the Interest of In
discussing means to increase tlie Income
of tile district so that the school ^
term may be kept to at least seven
months and, the school may retain le
the $300 State >aid as a' three teacher P(
rural graded school. This is a typical Tl
country district with no corporate 11
property and with only $36,000 of
fox-oKlr* r\r?/\ncn*fonrl iirifVi* fnrrr foY- x 4
ia Aayit j^i uiiu " itu rv ict-fv v i
payers who pay on more than $1,000. in
And yet the school spirit prevails to of
a large degree ami should be encouraged
in every way possible. The district
is to vote todav on the questiou
st
of levying an additional four mills
making the maximum that can be '
el
levied under the constitution. And
Wl
we believe the tax will be voted with
ar
practical unanimity and those who
SE
may note against it will t'all in lin?
and give their hearty cooperation to *
the suDDort of the school. That is the ^
spirit that should be encouraged. Su- r<1
peril]tendent Swe&ringen practically rc
said that if the tax were voted tie sc
would then be in position to help the 1S
school with State aid from the fund
which is given to him to aid weak *n
and needy schools. He made a plain 0A
and practical talk and told the peopU n
just what he was doing. Mr. Barre ^
explained the financial condition and n(
status of the district at this time. The to
writer was called on and responded a*
briefly.
After the meeting Mr. Swearingen ai
and iMr. Carre came on to Newberry ar
with us. We were delayed some en ^
route by having to repair a puncture
but we reached Newberry along about ^
one o'clock in the morning. We were
pica sort to have both of the officials
spend the night with us,
Tuesday morning Mr. Swearingen
and Mr. Parre visited the St. Phillips ^
school. We regret that it was impos- ri
sible for us to leave the office and jn
therefore the pleasure of a visit to
this school was not ours. They also tl]
visited the city schools during the p.
morning. th
We had arranged to make a visit d1
to the old folk at home on Tuesday and el
to stop at Chappells school on our 'u
return, so we offered to take Mr. st
Swearingen and Mr. Barre to Chap- si
pells. Wo left Xewberry something
: y or 12 c.Vock and drove oat to Sil- J<
verstreet. where they have on.e of the
best school houses in the county and la
where they al?o have a gool three V
tnacher school and a stop of about an ci
hour was made a: this school. Mr. r.i:
?!'eii is principal and Misses Senn
and summer teachers in the primary q(
department. About an hour was spent a
in this school and the greatest part of n,

she has about thirty little fellows just tl"
beginning. It was very interesting to S1
note how she has trained them and ai
how well they read and what excel- jc
lent discipline prevails and what fine ta
order. b]
The next stop was at Ridge Spring 9
wheh is taught by Misses Simpson and
Smith, the good peop'e of this district ji
having coted a i'our mills tax and C(
would be a rural graded school but ai
< or the fact they have not the chil- oi
?* ? ? 11% AnA V n i 4 r
riren, Dut mey are giving ujusc wai ci
are there the best of training. These tt
young ladies are doing excellent e;
work. They have only 26 children, u
Our stop here was brief. d'
We then drove on to Chappells and ir
^ft Messrs Barre and Swearingen
nd went on to the old home wnere
e found the folk well and giad to see
s. Alter'spending about two hour^
ere and getting a good square meal
e came back to Cimppelis for the
:;hcol meeting.
The Cliappells school is taught by
fiss Lizzie Xeel and Miss Boone.
Ilia is one of the handsomest country
2I100] l/ruse in the State, and " we
now they have a sood school, and
lis is one of the fi/.est communities
1 the State; HV'e <lon't know Miss
oone but we know that Miss Nee!
one of those girls who does things 1
:id slie' knows how.
The large auditorium is seated with j
andsome opera chairs and the i
I
ass rooms are 'furnished with mod- j
li individual desks. The district i
.
iedi> more wiiite people and more j
:ildren. The writer presided at ^lie j
eeting at the request of the priii j
pai and presented Mr. Barre who I
ade a short talk and Mr. Swearingen j
ho delivered a very excellent ad i
ess.
The attendance w;is good and the in- j
;rest in the school was manifest, j
i fact fhe .people are proud of thoir
'liievements in the school work and !
ev have a right to be.
President Harms of Newberry colge
will deliver an address at Chapills
in the school auditorium on
aesday evening at 8 o'clock, April
'
*
It is always a pleasure to us to;
sit the schools and to see that the !
I
terest in the cause of the education j
the children is kept alive.
The road from Newberry to Silverroct
has been greatly improved but
is rough, and bumpy and needs leviniz
down. Tlie surfacing lias been
ell lone but it is blown out in holes
id makes it a little rough and needs
aothing down. \
