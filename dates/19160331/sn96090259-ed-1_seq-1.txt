BELIEVE VILLA IS
HEADEDSANANDRES
THIS IS SOUTHWEST OF CHI
HUAHUA CITY
WILL BE HARD TO CATCH
ADMIT AMERICAN CAVALRYMEN NAVE
SLENDER HOPE OF OVERTAKING
BANDIT AND TROOPS NOW
El Paso, Maroh 31.—Dispatohes from
the front oaased the belief that Fran
oisoo Villa is headed for San Andres,
twenty-five miles southwest of Chi
huahua City, the bandit's favorite
headquarters. Villa is thought to be
not less that fifty miles ahead of hie
pursaers.
Americans here familiar with the
ooantry and tbe bandit agree that the
district around Parral and south to
^Torreon is Villa's objective. In this
territory numerous Villista bands,
under the leadership of Canuto Reyes*
are operating with considerable suc
oess.
If Villa is able to effeot a janoton
with Reyes the prof lem of his extermi
nation will be serious, as he will-be able
to control several thousand soldiers
who, split into guerilla bands, might
'continue their desultory mountain
warfare indefinitely. It is admitted
that the hope of the Amerioan cavalry
men to overtake Villa is slender.
The supplies question overshadows
everything else. Army men say that
.1 upon its solution depends the sucoess
of the expedition, Motor transpor
tation over the mountains is praotioally
impossible, Paok-mulisa can furnish
tbe only means. It is understood that
Pershing plans establishing a base
near the mountain fastness.
The border situation is quiet.
Troops have scoured the region
where it was reported last night that
Mexioans raided the Kelley ranch, but
found no trace of tbe bandits. It is
believed the alarm was due to the over
wrought nerves of the women.
LOCAL BOYS PICKED
Hills
Rapid City Coach Picks All-Black
Basket Ball Team
The Rapid Oity Journal of recent
date has the following from the pen of
George E, Glossop, Rapid City ooaoh,
giving his selection for an All-Blaok
Hills basket ball team. D'. Eastman,
of this oity is picked for the first
team and several of the other boys
for the second team. The artiole is as
follows:
First Team: Steinhauer, Belle
Fourohe, forward D. Eastman, Hot
Springs, (0) forward Callan, Rapid
Oity, center Lanphere, Rapid City,
guard Englebreoht, Rapid City, gnard
Second team: Sherman Belle
Fourohe, forward A. Gray, Rapid Oity
forward Magowan, (C) Hot Springs*
center Gibson, Hot Springe, guard
Baboook, Belle Fourohe, guard.
In going over the iudividuial players
of the Black Hills High School League
with the idea of selecting be best com
bination, the writer has three thoughts
in mind: First, select tbe best field
goal scoring combination second, the
best defensive combination, and, third,
players who play team ball.
Under, the first head, Steinhauer, of
Belle Fourohe, is head and ahoulders
above his rivals. His defensive record
is not so good, but on his scoring
ability, Steinhauer is chosen as the
first player. To pick a suitable running
mate for Steinhauer is a difficult mat
ter since good forwards are abundant
To be a euooessful forward a player
must be able to oover the floor, shoot
goals and find his immediate opponent
as soon as his team lose possession
the ball. He must never be over
anxious to soore himself,-but must be
qulok' to see opportunities to pass
men approaching the basket from dif
ferent angles at speed which will carry
them to a better position for a shot
Suoh a forward, we find in Dean East
man, of Hot Springs, who is also chosen
as captain. Other forwards of merit
are Sherman of Belle Fourohe and
Alex Gray of Rapid City, as were also
Eastman of Hot Spring*, and Stewart
of Rapid City.
The position of center is undoubted
ly the hardest one to play well and few
men realize its possibilities. A center
must have the oombined qualities of
forward and a guard as well as the
necessary reach to give his team the
ball at the tost up. Callan, of Rapid
City, bad all three qualities and out
played every man pitted against him.
Magowan, of Hot Springs, however,
poesed many of these attributes but
was very erratio especially in games
away from his home floor.
For guards, we have a combination
in Oapt. Englebreoht and Lanphere, of
Rapid City, that oould not be excelled.
What more oan one aBk of a guard than
that he be speedy, strong on defense, a
good dribbler and an acourate goal
tosser—and Lanphere poBsed all of
these. Modest and unassuming and
rarely making an attempt at individual
play, one oannot easily explain how
Englebreoht brought about the results
he did, His free throwing was above
par as witnessed In the Chadron Nor
nal when he threw thirteen out of six
teen trys, Gibson, of Hot Springs, and
Babcock, of Belle Fourohe. were good
defensive players but seldom scored a
point throughout the season.
All in all the season was most suc
cessful Belle Fourohe aa Black Hills
ohampion journied to the State tour
nament, where they acquitted them
selves with a great deal of credit. Rapid
City finished their season by soundly
trouncing the moob touted Spearflsh
Normal.
A EULOGY OF THE PRAIRIE
Beauty
A University Professor Describes Its
in Glowing Terms
Vermillion, Maroh 31.—"No longer
do men fear, hate or despise the
prairie," says Wilbelm Miller of the
University of Illinois in a remarkable
tribute to the glory of the prairies.
His "Religion of the Prairie" is wonder
fully expressive of the spirit and ideals
of South Dakota.
The most oreative people who ever
lived were the Greeks," he says, "but
tbe greatest raoe the world Bhall ever
know will be cradled in tbe Middle
west. The climate and tbe landsoape
make that oertaln. For the middle
west is tbe world's greatest runway for
the winds—and for ideas. We have no
complicated- mountain system, as
Europe, to breed endless artificial dif
ferences of dress, language, and
thought. There is not one range be
tween tbe Alleghanles and the Rookies
to stop the sweep
of the winds or the
triumphal maroh of man's progress. A
better way of doing things or a nobler
ideal, spreads like a prairie fire. An
extreme climate breeds a lusty body,
and abroad landsoape instils breadth of
mind. These two forces, acting silently
throughout the oenturies, will beget a
corresponding breadth of soul. En
vironment must, In time, make its
mark.
"No longer do men fear, hate, or de
spise the prairie. Tbey once thought
that Hat land must ever be monoto
nous, dull, stupefying. But a new.
virile, prairie sohool of art has opeued
our eyes to the meaning of those vast
horizontal lines of land, orops, woodf,
and the sky. which are the peouliar
glory of the prairie.
"Tbe heavenward pointing mountain
Is not tbe ODly symbol of aspiration
the ever-stretching ocean and the
prairie are also symbols of the Infinite.
The barren mountains and tbe un
harveited sea may smite the soul with
awe, but Hie joyous prairie is tbe
world's loveliest reminder of God's
endless bouuty. The secret charm of
every prairie view is the vision which
it Inspires of a united and prosperous
humanity. The sablime breadth of
the earth's surface stirs every one to
consecrate his life toward realizing that
vision. This is the 'religion of the
prairie' that is getting into men'9
bones. Everyone who works for the
good of his community knows what
this means,
i'he religion of the praire is tbe
gospel of beauty. Tbe waving banners
of the corn beget tbe insurgent soul
The middle west is a 'far- flung battle
line' that fights corruption and ugli
n»"- in every form. Can't you see
marching irresistibly toward the ine
vitable goal of universal brotherhood?
Isn't this your religion? Have you en
listed for the fight? If not, join some

their formal announcement for office
in this issue of the Star, their cards

forerunner of what will oome before
the primary and as the announcements
appear ail will be given the same con
sideration regardless of party at the
bands of the Star.

is oupable of filling the office very ac
ceptably to the voters He is oompetent
and has olerical ability above the aver
age. He is a man whom his friends
will be glad to help into seouring the
oflioe he desires.
For lleglHter of
IN
DOCIH
Andy Ball has deoided to be a can
didate for re-election ou the democrat
ic ttoket for the office Of register of
deeds. He is well known to a large
number of acquaintances in tbe oounty
and as bis work has been highly satis
factory during his present term, most
people concede him a second tt rm as is
usually the case ill thi^pounty. It is
not likely that he will have any oppo
sition on either ticket.
For Stntea Attorney
As the republican candidate for tbe
nomination for the offioe of states at
torney E. B. Adams is coming before
the voters this year as a good man for
the piece. He has been a resident of
this county for the past four or five
years and during that time has proven
himself a lawyer of ability. He is a
good trial lawyer and if elected will
give the oounty the 6ervioe that it
needs. His outspoken manner has

back him to do at all times that which
he feels it his duty to do.

business man will look after the ties
of the offioe if elected in a oapnble
manner. That he will seoure the nom
ination is praotioally assured.
B. J. Glattly is the democrat in the
raoe for tbe offioe of commissioner and
a cleaner or more upjvright business
man it would be bard to find anywhere
He will oonduot his campaign for tbe
offioe in the same manner he has al
ways oonduoted his own private busi
ness and it is bound to win him lots of
votes. He has a large circle of warm
friends who will give him loyal support
for the offioe whioh he seeks.
For County Auditor
J. H. Gillespie is out for oounty
auditor on the republican ticket. Mr.
Gillespie Is so well and favorable
known to tbe voters of this oouuty
that any word of commendation from
thiB paper is unnecessary. However
be is a very capable office man and
says he is absolutely opposed to the
high taxes heaped upon the taxpayers
of tbe oounty and when elected will as
sist in cutting down the unnecessary

looking to the c&eienoy and best in

are already in the raoe. The first to
announoe some time ago however was
D. lv. Batohelor who is a candidate on
the democratic ticket for the- nomi
nation Duve needs no introduotlon
to the voters of the oounty. His
natural ability and fearless manner
will make him an ideal man for the of
Hoe whioh be seeks.
J*y Crane is a republican condidate
for sheriff before the primaries and be
ing one of the old timers in the oounty
will get a good vote by reason of his
large acquaintanceship over the county,
lie has never held a public offioe,always
'levoting his entire time and attention
to his business rather than to politics,
lie has a host of friends who are
anxious to have him bold the office.
Chas. Conger, of Beaver preoinot, is
also a republican candidate for tbe
nomination to the office of sheriff,
Charley will poll a big vote in the east
half of the oounty aud will make any
opposition candidate hustle to win in
any part of the oouuty. Charley has

FIRE LOSS LOW
Less Than J00.000 Acres of National Forest
Burned in 1915
Washington, Maroh 31.—Forest fires
burned over not quite 300,000 aorea of
National Forest land in 1915, aooording
to official reports just oompiled, or less
than two aores per thousand. Out of
a total of 6,324 fires, 346, or five and
one-half per cent, did damage to the
amount of 9100 or more.
The timber loss was 156,000,000 board
feet, valued at $100,000 00. Although
the season was regarded as one of un
usual exposure, owing to delayed fall
rains, tbe
IOSB
was materially below the
average of the last five
yearB.
Over
87 per cent of this loss occurred In the
states of Oregon, Washington, and Ida
ho, while more than 72 per cent was in
Oregon alone. Besides tbe timber loss,
tires destroyed reproduction, of youug
tree growth, of an estimated value of
8100,000, aud $3,407 worth of forage.
The loss per fire in 1915 was $60.41
which is 914.03 less than tbe five-year
average, while the cost of fighting eaoh
fire was 920.73 less.
Lightning figures as the chief cause
of forest fires in 1915, as it does in the
average year. Twenty-sight and a
half per cent of the fires *were due to
this cause. Campers caused eigeteen
per cent, which is two and a half per
cent higher than the average. Eleven
per cent were caused by brush burning.
Nearly eleven per cent were of in
cendiary origin. Railroads were re
spoudible for nearly nine per cent of
tbe fires in 1915, as agalust fourteen
and a half per oent due to this cause in
tbe average year. The oauaes of over
fifteen per cent were unknown. Lum
bering operation? caused less than
three per cent.
