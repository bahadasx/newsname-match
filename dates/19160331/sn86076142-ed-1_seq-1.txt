judging from the specific gravity of
the rock and the proportion of black

as though nature in her prodigality

One remarkable and pleasing fea
ture of the Murray at this point is that
it has straightened to approximately
18 or 20 degrees from the vertical. A
person must observe closely or he will

CHANGES IN STANDARDS
(By A4Mtalc4 1'rrMM.I
LONDON, Mar. 31. One of the
changes brought about In English hab
its by the war Is the effect it la hav
ing in popularizing the metric system
of weights and measures. The an
nual report of the chief Inspector of
weights and measures in London, Just
issued, shows that he was called upon
to give his official approval of 33,000
metric weights and measures during
1915, whereas in the previous year the
number was only 1,700.

LEWES, Mar. 31. Ernest Scheller,
who captured the Matoppo and ter
rorized Its crew of fifty-six, shortly
after the ship sailed from New York
with railroad supplies for Russia, as
serted that he Is a German spy. He
said his instructions were to blow up
the Matoppo to prevent its cargo from
reaching Russia, but the plea of the
captain for his wife and daughter was
to much for him. "I haven't the
heart to do it," he said. Examination
of Scholar's mental condition will be
made. In all likelihood he will be
taken to tha British West Indies and
tried for piracy.
underground workings of the Exten
sion merger and in the columns of this
paper, if privileged by the respective
managements, but the top workings
are also worthy of this brief reference.
The Victor bins are completed and
contain 2,000 tons of ore, taken out la
development work. The third rail
electric railroad from the Victor to
the No. 2 shaft of the Extension, where
It joins the track which extends to
the Extension mill, will be completed
in a week if certain electrical appara
tus, delayed In transmission, arrivee
in that time. The addition to the mill
is nearly in readiness for the Installa
tion of the two new batteries of
stamps. The concrete foundation for
the machine shop, 120 to 60 feet, Is
finished and there Is an air of syn
chronism about the entire establish
ment that bespeaks keen foresight and
harmonious action of all the forces
that are conspiring to make of the Ex
tension merger the world's greatest
silver mine.
Consider also the prospective pro
ducers, of which the following have
ore, although not yet In commercial
quantities: Mizpab. .Extension, Mon
arch Pittsburg, Gypsy Queen, Califor
nia Tonopah. Then there are the fol
lowing developing properties, all of
which are in line to get-ore: Great
Western, Buckeye Belmont, East End,
Umatilla, Tonopah Bonanza. In addi
tion there are the following proper
ties that are expected to be operated
with little delay: Tonopah 76, West
Tonopah, Comstock, "Phoenix, Table
Mountain, East Belmont, Golden Gate
and Mt. Oddie Mines company.
The outlook now Is for the employ
ment'of nearly 3,000 miners before the
close of summer, this number Includ
ing those working in mills and offi
ces, averaging $4.50 a day, or $400,000
a month. This number is to a large
extent dependable upon the price of
silver, which, being now past the 60
cent mark, is almost certain for a fur
ther and considerable raise, making
the ores of Tonopah very profitable.
