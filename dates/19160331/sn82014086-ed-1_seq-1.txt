nett Immigration bill, with its literacy
test and Asiatic exclusion provisions
unchanged, passed the house late to

goes to the senate, where favorable
action Is regarded as assured.
The literacy test, about which the
fight against the bill bad centered, was
sustained, 284 to 107. This provision
lias been the cause of vetoes of simi
lar Immigration bills by Presidents
Cleveland, Taft and Wilson. The house
passed the bill over the Cleveland va
to, but it failed in the senate. Motions
to override the vetoes of Presidents
Taft and Wilson were lost in the house
by narrow margins." Representative

committee, predicted tonight that
there was sufficient strength to re-pass
the bill in the event of another veto.
The president has not indicated his
purpose to the househ leaders.
Both record votes tooth on the lit
eracy test and on the passage of the
bill were without regard to party
lines. Majority Leader Kitchin voted
for the literacy test and for the bill.

Got Waits Money
BUT 8AY8 HE NEVER INTENDED
TO TESTIFY FAL8ELY
HAD $9,000 IN BUREAU
Kane Went to District Attorney's Of
fice and Declared the Cheek for
S9400 and $9,000 in Cash Were Vir
tually Forced Upon Him.
New York. March 0. Eugene Oliver
Kane, who embalmed the body of John
E. Peck, for whose murder Dr. Arthur
Warren Waite Is under arrest hern
went to District Attorney Kdward
Swann's office today and denied he
had ever had any intention of testify
ing that the embalming fluid used on
T-eckB body contained arsenic, as
Waite is said by Mr. Swum to have
alleged.
Admitted Receivinq Money.
Kane admitted, however, it was said
that he had received $9,000 in cash and
a check for $9,400 from Waite, which
the young dentist has said was to be
in exchange for swearing that there
was arsenic in the fluid and placing the
poison In a sample to be delivered to
Mr. Swann. According to the embalm
cr'a story, the money was virtually
forced on him. Kane was accompanied
by his counsel and although an order
for bis arrest had been issued he -was
allowed to remain at liberty la the
custody of his attorney.
Undertaker Sent Him to Waite.
Kane said he was sent to Waite by
John S. Potter, the undertaker who
had charge of Peck's funeral, and who
told him Waite wished to ask him
.about the embalming fluid. At Waite'a
solicitation he met the dentist in a
garage, where he said Waite asked him
if he could put arsenic in a sample of
embalming fluid for the district attor
ney. Kane replied it could be done,
but that it was against the law. Waits
then offered him a check for $9,400,
which he said he did not want, but h
did not return it. Waite, be said,
promised to make him "comfortable
for life."
Accepted Roll Containing $9,000.
Less than two hours later he met
Waite In a cigar store by appoint
ment, although he said he did not know
why Waite wanted to see him. They
both went into a telephone both and
Waite placed a large roll of bills, which
Waite told 'Mr. Swann contained $9,000,
Into Kane's hands, saying:
"Now, for God's sake, get that stuff
In the sample and get it down to the
district attorney's face."-
Kane told Mr. Swann he kept the
monev.
"I was too scared to know where I
was," he said.
Secreted Money in His Bureau.
Then he went home, without count
ing the money, which was In bills of
large denomination, aod secreted it in
his bureau.
"I was so nervous I shook l!ke a
leaf." he told the district attorney.
The presence of the money in the
house made hi mso restless, be eala,
that he took it to Long Island Thurs
day and hid it there. A man from the
district attorney's office will go with
him tomorrow to the place where the
money is hidden. He had not spent
any of it. he said.
Undertaker Potter was taken to Mr.
Swann's office while Kane was beinx
examined and was again questioned.
It is expected an Indictment will be
returned against Watte tomorrow by
the grand jury which has had the case
under consideration.
