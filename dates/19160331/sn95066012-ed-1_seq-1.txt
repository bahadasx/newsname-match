San Antonio, Tex., March 31.
American troops and Villa's forces
have exchanged shots. According to
reports received today by Gen. Funs
ton, Villa and a picked band of bandits
are making their way from Guerrero
along the road to Chihuahua city.
In the clash between the Americans
and the Villistas, the chief is reported
to have been wounded in the leg.
El Paso, Tex., March 31. It has
been learned at field headquarters of
the American expeditionary forces; in
Colonla Dublan, Chihuahua, that Fran
cisco Villa nearly lost bis life a few
days ago on tbe Corralitos ranch, a
short distance from that place, where
he tortured and put to death five Mexi
cans. One of his victims leaped upon
him and was strangling Villa when of
ficers beat his assailant senseless with
the butts of their guns.
Mucio Polanco was the name of the
Mexican who almost succeeded in end
ing Villa's career. The murder of five
members of the Polanco family was
said to have been intended to be a
warning against other Mexicans
against having dealings with Ameri
cans. Investigation showed that the
Polanco family was involved with no
political faction in Mexico, but that
they had a record of uniform honesty
and reliability in dealing with the
American managers of the Corralitos
ranch, where they were born and
When Villa, retreating from Colum
bus, arrived at the ranch, he had a
list of all the Polancos, six men, the
mother and two daughters. He seized
the men and hunted for the daughters,
but the-young women had been hid
den so well that he never found them
To five of the men, Gregorlo and his
two sons, and Mucio and his one son,
Villa said: "I am going to kill you
because you are too Americanized.
You are gringo lovers."
But instead of killing them outright
Villa had them partly stripped and
then beaten with the flats of heavy
swords. Mucio Polanco broke away
from his captors and got one hand
locked about Villa's throat before he
was beaten off. Next Villa ordered
the five stood up beneath a huge
archway where he told them he would
hang them. Ropes were placed about
their necks and they were jerked into
the air, but were not permitted to die.
Just when Iobs of consciousness ap
proached they would be lowered to
earth with demands that they reveal
the hiding places of horses said to be
concealed about the ranch. There
were no horses, so far as investigation
has disclosed. The prisoners also were
offered their lives if they would tell
where money was hidden or point out
valuable documents.
After several mock hangings Villa
ordered the Ave taken into the garden,
where each one was shot five times.
To the residents of the ranch, all
Mexicans, Villa said: "You may bury
them or not, as you r . please." They
were all buried in one grave after Villa
left.
San Antonio, Tex., March 30. After
killing every one of the one hundred
and seventy-two men' in the garrison
at Guerrero, Francisco Villa moved
northward yesterday and now is some
where near the headwaters of the San
ta Maria river, according to unofficial
reports to General Funston tonight.
At the head of a considerable force,
Villa was reported to be on the San
Geronimo ranch or the Quemada ranch
and troops of both the United States
and Mexico were believed to be clos
ing in on him.
This information was regarded by
General Funston and his staff as prob
ably correct. If correct, it appeared
probable that soon Villa either, will
have to face his pursuers in fight or
make another break through the tight
ening line of troops.'
Whether his assault on the garrison
at Guerrero was the same engagement
reported by General Pershing, was not
known, but it was regarded as likely
since the action reported by General
Pershing occurred March 27, some
where in that region. Details of the
engagement were not reported.
General Pershing has been advised
of the report as to Villa's location and
It is known that the disposition of his
troops and that of the Mexican gov
ernment are such that Villa cannot
easily escape without a fight. Ameri
can troops are converging in columns
from the north and it was indicated
that a part of them had gone so far
south that they would be able to join
with the Carranza forces in preventing
'his escape in that direction.
Other than that no supplies for the
troops in the field had crossed into
Mexico from El Paso, ' for shipment
over tha Norf hwflsfern rullwnv. tin
news concerning that development of
the situation was givenout tonight.

More Stringent Blockade Measures
Put in Force
INNOCENCE MUST BE PROVED
Vessels and Cargoes Subject to Seiz
ure While on Way to Nonblockaded
Port.
London, March 31. A British order-in-
council was issued last night whore
by "neither a vessel nor her cargo
shall be immune from capture for a
breach of blockade upon the sole
ground that she at tho moment is on
her way to a nonblockaded port." The
crtler sets' forth that, subject, to cer-
ain modifications and omissions, the
government has put In froce the dec
laration of London respecting the
,:a;ture of men bant craft during the
war.
Certain doubts, however, have aris
en concerning the right to effect "the
capture of conditional contraband on
board a vessel bound to a neutral
port." which It is "expedient to put
an end to," and it has been decided no
longer to adopt article 19 of the dec
laration, which provides that "what
ever may be the ultimate destination
of a vessel or of her cargo she cannot
bo captured for breach of blockade, if
at the moment she is on her way to a
nonblockaded port."
It is therefore or.lered that the pro
visions of the declaration of London
"shall not be deemed to limit, or to
have limited, in any way tho right of
his majesty, in accordance with the
law of nations, to capture goods upon
the ground that they are conditional
contraband nor to affect, or to have
affected, the liability of conditional
contraband to capture, whether the
carriage of the goods to their destina
tion be direct of entail transshipment
or subsequent transport by land." , ,-
This provision is made applicable
also to absolute contraband. Another
clause says that enemy destination
"may be presumed to exist if the
goods are consigned to a person who,
during tbe present hostilities, has for
warded imported contraband goods to
territories belonging to -or occupied by
the enemy." .The order further says
that "it shnll lie upon the owners of
goods to prove that their destination
was innocent. The order in council
is to be effective from yesterday.

Tuckerton, N. J.) M. Loncin, private
secretary to Cardinal Mercier, the Bel

cording to a dispatch from Brussels,
given out today by the Overseas

"An investigation was begun some
time ago," says the News Agency,
"of M. Loncin, who was suspected of

BRITISH STEAMER
HELD UP BY LONE
STOWAWAY
German Youth Captured Matoppo
aud Crew of Fifty-Six Men
NOW HELD AT LEWES, DELAWARE
Rifled Safe and Compelled Captain to
Give Him Small Boat But Caught
Before He Reached Shore.
Ixiwes, Del., March 31. How a lone
German stowaway held up the captain
and 66 members of the crew of the
British steamer Matoppo, compelling
thera at the point of a revolver to
change the course of the vessel aud
land him at the Dcleware breakwatei
after he had rifled the ship's safe and
taken their, valuables, was told . last
night by Capt. Bergner, master of the
Matoppo. The stowaway, whp gave
his name as Ernest Schiller and that
he had lived in Hobotten, N. J., for the
past eight months, is now locked up in
Lewes Jail awaiting the arrival of the
United States district attorney from
Wilmington, Del., and the British con
sul-general from Philadelphia.
The hold-up took place outside the
three-mile limit and federal author!
ties say that this government, under
the circumstances, probably will have
nothing to do with the matter. Schll
ler, they say, will be returned to the
Matoppo and turned over to Britlsl:
officials at St. Lucia, where the vessel
will stop for coal.
The Matoppo sailed from New York
Wednesday for Vladivostok with a
cargo consisting chiefly of barbed wire
and farm implements. She passed out
Sandy Hook at 6 o'clock in' the even
ing. Two hours later, upon, entering
his cabin. Capt. Bergner says he wat
confronted by a young man With
revolver in each hand.
"Hands up, and not a sound lf .yov
value' your life!" was the command
that greeted him.
The captain was then bound banc"
and foot and locked in his cabin, prom
lsing, under penalty of death, not tt
raise an alarm.
Then, cautiously making his waj
to the wireless cabin, the stowaway
who is about 26 years old. put the in
struments out of commission ant
threw the ship's guns, consisting o:
six rifles, overboard, He then re
turned to the captain's cabin, .. riflec"
the safe and destroyed many import
ant papers. He had expected, he tolc
Capt. Bergner, to find at least 200f
sterling In English money aboard the
Matoppo, but in this his hopes wen
shattered. There was not a penny ii
tho safe. Later, however, Schillei
compelled tho captain and the firs'
officer to hand over their pocketbooks
containing a total of about 30 ster
lint;.
'With Capt. Bergner still a prisonei
in his own cabin, Schiller proceeder
to round up the crew of 5(i men, al
but a few of whom were in theii
bunks. He lined all hands up in oik
end of tho ship and threatened it any
one made a move he would blow
everybody to pieces with bombs he
had placed In different parts of the
vessel,..
At 4 ' "o'clock yesterday morninr
Schiller released Capt. Bergner, and,
still gripping a revolver In each hand
ordered the steamer headed toward'
the shore. Other officers and mem
bers of the crew were likewise orucj
ed to their places and told to put oi
all Bpeed for the Delaware Capes
When the Matoppo came within sight
of land about noon Schiller ordered a
small boat lowered to take him
ashore. Meanwhile the steamer's
signals asking for assistance had been
sighted by the pilot boat Philadelphia
which immediately responded to the
call and took the small boat In tow
disregarding the threats of Schiller
who threatened to shoot anybody who
laid a hand on him.
Steaming for the Delaware Break
water, the Philadelphia was met ofl'
Cape Henlopen, Del., by a coast
guard power boat which had put out
from Lewes in answer to the Matoppo's
signals. Capt. John S. Lynch, in com
mand of the power boat, quickly dis
armed Schiller, who was placed In
irons and brought ashore. Later he
was locked up in the jail.

HOSPITAL FUND GROWING
Water System Earned $16,337.62 Dur
ing Past Year.
Clerk W. P. Hogan of tho board of
A'ater commissioners today turned
sver to Treasurer Charles H. Dewey
:he sum of $9,294.50, the net earning
3f the water system for the six months
Hiding March 31. This makes a total
of ..16,337.62 for the past year.
With the addition made today the
water system has turned over to Ihe
hospital association a total of $43.
117.05 during the three years that have
elapsed since the system came into
possession of the village through the
.dft of the late Henry W. Putnam of
San Diego who organized the company
.hat built the system.
It was provided by the deed of gift
from Mr. Putnam that the sum of
$1500 should be diverted each year in
to a sinking fund for permanent 1m
orovement of the system, that $000
should annually be allowed for the
cost of extensions and that the net
revenue should semi-annually . be
turned over to the treasurer of the
Henry W. Putnam Memorial Hospital
association.
The association has already pur
chased a lot upon which some improve
ments have been made and has se
cured plans for the building. Some
time ago a movement was inaugurated
for the immediate construction of the
hospital through a bond issue to be
guaranteed by the village of Benning
ton but judging from preseut indica
tions has deemed It best to delay ac
tual work until the fund has assumed
larger proportions.
The water commissioners and the
clerk feel that they have good reason
to be pleased with the manner in
which the system has so far been con
ducted as a public utility.

GOAL PRICES Will
NOT BE REDUCED
APRIL FIRST
Present Quotations to Remain in
Force During Summer
MINERS ASKING FOR MORE PAY
Prospect that Figures Will Go to $S
For Egg and 8.25 for Stove and
Chestnut September 1.
There is little prospect that the us
ual reduction in prices of 50 cents a
ton on coal will be announced on Sat
urday, April 1. The operators and
miners are now in consultation in New
York over a demand for increased
wages and changes In working sched
ules and the outlook for an immediate
settlement Is not promising..
Ever since the big strike in the coal
regions in 1902 it has been the. policy
of tbe operators to establish a mini
mum price which should go into effect
on April 1. Beginning May 1 there ha
been a monthly increase of ten cents
a ton. , This addition of ten cents a ton
was continued each month until Sep
tember 1, five months, and the price
was then established for the coming
six months. .
This plan was adopted for the pur
pose of keeping the coal business, both
at the mines and in the offices of the
retail dealers, in continuous operations
through the summer months. A sav
ing of 50 cents a ton was a sufficient
inducement for many persons to put
in their supplies of coal during the per
lod of low prices. But for this induce
ment the mines could not operate tc
anywhere near full capacity In summer
and the dealers would have a period ol
comparative idleness.
The present cash prices for coal in
Bennington are $7.75 for stove and
chestnut and $7.50 for egg. . If the
operators and the miners reach an
agreement there may be a reduction
from these prices but the prospect is
not promising, indications are that
the present quotations are bottom fig
tires and that on May 1 coal in. Ben
nington will cost $7.85 and $7.f0 and
that the buyer who waits until after
September 1 will have to pay $8.25 and
$8 for his winter's supply.
MISSING BOY FOUND
John Paul King of Williamstown Was

John Paul King, Jr., aged 14, who
disappeared from his home in Wil
liamstown over a week ago, through
the article which appeared in the Ban
ner on Monday, was located Thursday
at the farm of Bert Olin in Shaftsbury.
The boy, who is large for his years,
is possessed of the idea that he wants
to work on a farm and when he left
home his parents began searching for
the youngster in the rural districts.
He was traced to North Bennington
early in the week and to Walloonisac
where the trail disappeared.
The publicity given to the boy s dis
appearance through the Banner ar
ticle attracted' attention to young
King's presence at the Olin farm and
the ultimate return of the youngster
to Williamstown. The boy went home
Thursday, saying that he would remain
there for a year but instituting that he
would eventually become a farmer. .

WEEKS SEEKS TO
BE LIEUTENANT
GOVERNOR
Speaker Announces Candidacy for
Second Place
HIS PLATFORM IS BRIEF
Judge Weeks Is Resident of Middle
bury and Has Record for Faithful
Work.
Middlebury, March 30. The 'second
announcement of a candidacy for a
state office on the republican ticket
next fall is made by Judge John E.
Weeks of this town, who aspires to ,
the lieutenant governorship. Judge
Weeks, who has been chairman of the
penal board for a number of years, la
speaker of the House of Representa
tives. .
Judge Weeks, who is a native of
Salisbury, located in Middlebury In
1896. Though his business has been,
largely in farming and mercantile
lines he has devoted himself to the
public service much of the time "since
he was elected a member of the Gen
eral Assembly in 1888. He was a mem
ber of the Senate In 1S96 and was re
turned In 1912 to the lower branch of
the Assembly.
In 1892-94 he was assistant judge of
Addison county and in 1S98 was ap
pointed a trustee 'of the Vermont In
dustrial school. He was state cattle
commissioner in 1906 and since the
latter year has been chairman of the
penal board. He has held most of the
town and village' offices. ..
In announcing his intention to en
ter the primaries next September as
a candidate for lieutenant governor
Judge Weeks makes the following
statement:
T have been asked by many friends
whether I would be a candidate for
lieutenant governor. It is perhaps due
to those who have kindly offered me
their support, and also fair to other
possible candidates, that I -Bhould an
nounce at this time that I will be a
candidate for the republican : nomina
tion for this office. If I am nominated.
' shall try to do my part toward a
vigorous and earnest campaign. If I
am elected,' I will do what ' I can to
secure as prompt dispatch of" legisla
tive business as is consistent with
thorough consideration and fairness to
every interest. .
I believe that the future 'of Ver
mont depends not bo much upon high
sounding phrases In party platforms
as upon the selection of capable, fair-
minded men as legislators and state
officers. I stand for everything that
an be done to assist both the agri
ultural and manufacturing industries
of the state, for the greatest economy
consistent with efficiency in the
management of state institutions, for
the continuation of the Vermont good
roads policy, for equity in taxation.
'or fair labor legislation, and for en-
leavor to inforce more strictly the
laws we have rather than to enact a
large number of new ones. '
'While I am a republican, the duties
of the lieutenant . governor-: ' ard so
argely concerned with state- matters
that if I receive the nomination I
shall appeal for support to "men of all
parties, and if elected, I will;:v try to
perform the duties of tbe.ofnce solely
in the Interest of Vermont." pv
