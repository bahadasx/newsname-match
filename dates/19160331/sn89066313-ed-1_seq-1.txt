CIIUVGO, .March 31. Attorneys in
the ia-e of Miss Mabel Sturtevant,
Univendtv of Missouri graduate
eharued with using the mails to de
fraud, made their closing arguments
today and the case was expected to
go to the jury late this afternoon.
e..terday afternoon Miss Sturtevant
took the stand before Judge J. Otis
Humphrey in her own defense of the
rh.irurs brought by the government
tli.it sli.' fraudulently used the mails in
In r business of soliciting money from
soi iet) people with which to aid girls
throuuli college.
Complaints of college girls against
the Association of College Women
Winkers were explained by Miss Stur
te.mt by saying it was because the
girls did not get their commissions
for .-elling cookbooks until the books
were paid for and because a large
r,;im!.;-r or orders for cookbooks were
cancelled that the girls did not get
the money they expected.
Defendant lleuie- Taking Funds.
Miss Sturtevant emphatically denied
using any of the association's funds
for her own use and said she had
s:ent JS.onn or her own money for
the publication of the cookbooks which
the girls sold.
"When the girls'complained to me
bounce they didn't get the amount of
money they would have received had
all the orders they took for cook
books been filled and paid. I secured
loans to get money for them," Miss
Sfirteant said.
"In each instance," she continued,
I named the girl to whom the money
was being lent and in most cases I
irtroduecd the girl to the person lcml
in the money."
Impri-oned in Eiaiislon limine.
story of how some ten or fifteen
.'lege girls, with the aid of three
men, imprisoned Miss Sturtevant in
i house in Kvanston and demanded
several thousand dollars of her, was
told by her formor attorney, Carl 0.
I'trnth. yesterday as the testimony in
the trial was being brought to a close.
"I was called out of bed at 7 o'clock
one mjiniiiig in the spring of 1913 to
answer the telephone," Attorney Be
mtli said in beginning his story. "It
va- Mhs Sturtevant calling me, and
-i." said that she was being held in a
hou-sp in Kvanston and wanted to
e me. When I reached the place I
foi'id a fake officer 'on the front
Kiel's and two men with ten or fif
teen college girls inside. One of the
oen said he was a lawyer and the
other man told me he was there to
protect the girls.
Threatened Her, Demanding Money.
"Viss Sturtevant was shut up in a
room, and she told me that they had
demanded $2,000 or ?".000 under
threat ot arresting her. I demanded
to vep a warrant, but the man who
posed as an officer could not produce
one I explained that Miss Sturtc
ant had no money to pay anything
and -bowed the girls that they had no
legitimate claims against her. Then I
told them that I would go to town
and get the real officers. If they
wanted to arrest Miss Sturtevant, I
-aid. it would be all right, but that I
would get a writ of habeas corpus for
her. At this they consented to release
her."
The defendant herself unhesitating
ly told of her operations of the busi
ness for which she is in trouble. She
acknowledged soliciting money from
prominent women, but flatly denied
that she had used any of the money
for herself or had any intent of de
frauding cither the donors or the girls
for whom it was asked.

TRUTH AS AN ASSET

Democracy Served by Spread-

ledge of the Few.
"The newspaper's sharing of the
knowledge of the few with the winy
lias made democracy possib! '," de
clared Dean Walter William.: or the
School or Journalism last alight in his ;uil011"te,l to JC.50. The boys could
address at the ITniversitv Auditorium "ot na'' tlieir fi,les' s" the'' were ta
on 'Journalism, a New Weapon for J kcn back to the JaiI
Democracy." "'J lj0'" ,las ,ecn in tbat cell since
"In former years," he said in part,
"the-newspaper was for the benefit of
the few. It was a views-paper rather
than a newspaper. Today it is for the
many. It brings whole peoples into
the limelight or publicity. Since it
must support itself from small con
tributions of the many, it cannot help
but be democratic. It furnishes the
raw material for public opinion.
"There are two views honestly held
by newspaper men on the function of;01 'asas -'ty for the best essay by
a newspaper. One is that a newspa- j a" undergraduate on some topic of
per is a commodity to be produced I Jfwisli culture, announced Henry
and sold for profit like any other com- j IIu,w'tz of Cincinnati, chancellor of
modify. The other view is that atlle Intercollegiate Menorah Associa
newspaper should print what the pub- Uon an1 editor-in-ciiier of the Meno-
lic should want. In the bitr ritv a
thousand events happen each day
which fit the definition of news. The
task of the editor is to select. One
editor gives the public exactly what
it wants. He considers the newspa
per a private enterprise, forgetting
that our press has a tacit franchise
from the public. The other editor
gives the people not so much what
they want as what they should want.
"But both editors believe in pub
lishing the news, ami the publication
of the news makes for democracy. It
is the town meeting in print. If the
European press had been permitted to
publish the news honestly about inter
national diplomacy and politics the
war might not have com about.
Censorship and government by the
sword are inseparable.
"A large amount (r capital is nec
essary for the publication of the mod
ern daily. There is danger in this al
liance between capital and newspa
pers. Here is a problem of democracy
and journalism today."
In answering the charge that news
papers lay too largo emphasis upon
sorrow, sin and crime. Dean Williams
said:
"Nothing would better please the
evildoer than secrecy. It is publicity
he fears. Journalism sometimes gives
a distorted picture, but it is a mirror
for all that, and more truthful than
some of those who buy it would like.
"The defects of the American news
paper reflect the defects of the Ameri
can people. The remedy for democ
racy is more democracy. ' It will not
come from the rule of the intellectual
few any more than from the political
boss. 'If ye shall know the truth,
truth shall make you free.'"

When Mexican bullets grew the

at almost any moment, when Villa and

their lives. They packed their lug

"Money money, money; We're go-

plained one ot the members or the
Mothers' Club or the Grant School at a
meeting at the school yesterday at
ternoon. "But one of the objects of our club
is to equip the playground and we've
got to have money to do that," said
another mother. "Furthermore, that's
what our meeting this afternoon is
for to discuss money matters."
And so the treasurer, .Mrs. J. K.
Boggs, counted up every penny, and
found that the club had $31.01 to
spend on the playground equipment
and on the convention of the Mothers'
Congress and Parent-Teacher Asso
ciations to be held here April 2o, 2C
and 27.
The Grant School and the Mothers'
Club will co-operate in financing the
playground. The planning of the play
ground will be left to C. I.. Brewer,
who will probably turn it over to one
of his advanced students. All the
teachers of Grant School were ap
pointed on the playground committee,
so that no grade would fail to get its
share of play apparatus. The moth
ers on the committee are Mrs. J. F.

To eliminate one point ot financial
