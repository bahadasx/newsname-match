The springs are later and also
the; autumns. ; Formerly much
corn was planted in March,' but
now it is not wise to do so as it
does not prove a success. Really
the almanacs and other regula
tors of the seasons should change
their ' divisions of months and
have January, February and the
month of March for the winter
months. Let spring and spring
flowers begin April the first.
The Hon. John Isaac- Cox, for
mer governor of Tennessee, and
for years boss of the State Sen
ate, is hungry for a piece of po
litical pie from Woodrow Wilson's
pie board, and it is reported that
John Isaac is to be postmaster at
Bristol. Quite a fall from gover
nor to postmaster, but why should
John Isaac worry so long as he
gets fed from the public teat?
Gov, Cox is a good fellow social
ly, but like many others,-he wants
a public job and he has gotten
many in the past.
NEW YORK .
LETTER
The recent attack of the Villa
bandits on Columbus, New Mexico,
where they killed and wounded a num
ber of Americans, and the sending of
several thousands of our troops into
Mexico to capture Villa, have brought
the republic to the south of us into
new notoriety, and I think yon read
ers would like something said about
that . country. , ... .'
I have never been in 'Mexico, but
have read a great deal about it, and a
gentlertantere who is associated fit!
roe spent most of . hia life there, ani
has told the some -very interesting
things about ii, s It is said on news
paper authority, but without any offic
ial confirmation, that negotiations are
now being made to buy all of Mexico,
fot the United States, aa far south as
a line stretched east and west between
Tampico and the southern end of
5ower California, for the sum of three
hundred millions of dollars. My friend
here says that the minerals In the one
state of Chihuahua alone are worth
several times that amount. It has
canyons, mountains and desert plains,
and contains vast numbers of serpents
and wild beasts, as Wei) as poisonous
insects, such as the tarantula and
centipede, ana. worse still, & mixed
population, among whom are Indians
and half- breeds as cruel and desper
ate as the Comanches of our western
plains every were. They have tortured
many of our people to death at times,
thinking notbiog or. stunning a raws
' legs and throwing him' into a blazing
brush-heap, or of forcing him to
march, bare-footed, among thorny cac
tus and chapparal till he falls helpless.
One peculiarly- Mexican custom is
to give a prisoner a chance to escape,
and then, when he Btarts to run,
through an open door, as any sane
- man would, to get out of such hand?,
he is shot down. This is the infamous
"ley fuga," or law of flight, which has
- cost the life of manv a good man,
k both Mexican and American.-
My friend says that only about ten
per cent of the Mexicans he saw were
of legitimate birth, and only about
twentv oer cent of them can read or
write. Very few indeed, are of pure
white blood but the vast majority are
either full-blood or half-breed Indians
mixed with Spanish or negro or other
monerel breed. The ancient Aztecs
- and other original inhabitants of Me
ico were a noble race compared with
the "greasers" of to-day. They get
drunk on pulque, mexcal, and peyote,
almost live oo those vile intoxicants,
tobacca and red pepper, and are rich
if they have a big bat, a knife, gun
and fine saddle ' Pulque is the aap of
the - .maguey, a fleshy-leaved growth
like a century;plantT The flower, stem
in the center is cut out and a place
scooped out where the sap collects,
and is then sucked op through a long
tube by the greasers, who deposit the
sap in a goat-skin 'bag (which 'does
not improve its flavor I .imagine) and
in a few days, in that' hot climate, it
turns to a curdleYtuff with a sour vil
lainous odor, and is then in condition
to fit a Mexican to serve: on ther staff
of Villa fy'Qld Scratch himself.? ; Mex
cal is a white, hot liquor, almost' pure
alcohol, which scalds the throat of an
American till the skin comes out in
threads, so a man told me, who had
tried it. The peyote is the worst
thing of all. It is the undeveloped
flower hud of a cactus, growing in the
state of TamaulipaB, which when
dried and dissolved on the tongue,
puts a man into delirum for a week,
and the use of it' brings on insanity
and death in a short time. These
''mezcal beans" as thpy are called in
New Mexico, wrought such havoc
among the Indians there that our gov
ernment has forbidden their use.
The prevailing religion is Roman
Catholic, but of a sort that may well
be called paganism, for they practic
ally, worship the figuros of their
saints, of whom there is one for ev
ery day in the year. A child is named
or the particular saint who rep
resents the day on which that child is
born. For instance, July 15, is the
day of San Enrique; therefore if a
man was born on that day you may be
sure his name is Henry (Enrique).
hus it comes that many men are
called Jesus, Mary or Joseph and
manv a Jesus-Mary Greaser has been
hung for his meaness on the border.
There are 155 different, tribes of
ndians in Mexico, each one speaking
a language different from the other,
and one," the Seri Indian, is one of
the fiercest' and cruelest in the world.
They fight like wild-cats, and no tor
ment is too atrocious far them to in
flict on a captive. If we ever buy
Mexico we will have a task of many
years in subduing them.-during which
the pioneers will have hard times,
But the wealth of that country, in
minerals especially will attract our
people there. My friend Bays that
gold is scattered all over Mexico,
while silver is there as nowhere else
on earth. Quicksilver, which now sells
at $200 per flask of 86 pounds, is es
pecially abundant in the states border
ing on Texas, as Nueva Leon, Chihu
ahua and Coahuila. Lead, copper and
iron are also there in millions of tons,
awaiting the capital to get them out
and into the market.
The great mountains of Popocate
petl and other towering peaks, pierce
the clouds and are always snow-cap
ped, while tropical heat burns in the
plains below.. The delicious guava,
better than the peach grows wild in
the thickets: - tbe . ceriman, a vine
which climbs to the tops of trees 100
feet high, baars a fruit that looks
like a grass-green ear of corn cover
ed with hexagonal scales, which when
ripe, surpasses the pineapple,' straw
berry or any otner fruit l have, ever
tasted. The Mexican consul at Bal
timore told me there were forty dif
ferent kinds of bananas in his coun
try, which never teach this market
some are not larger than your little
finger, and of a flavor like spices and
cream; others are as large as your
arm, and are baked for eating. Then
there are the casf ava, sapadillo, lo-
quat, Cherimolia, pepino, mango,
avocado, pitanga, sapote, mispeno,
maranon, cacao or chocolate and doz
ens of other delicious, fruits that are
unknown in this country, but which
grow wild there, along with oranges
lemons, limes and grape-fruits. Sul
phur is mined from the extinct vol
cano oi ropocatepetl and runs
down the mountain side in thousand
of tons, and there are silver and gold
mines in many places, but the lack of
water, and above all, the want of
a good government, hold back deve
opment. We really have enough of
our own to look after, but if Uncle
Sam does go in there to stay, it cer
tainly will mean the addition of un
told wealth to the -nation which is
now the richest under the sun our
own America,
We must not imagine that the Mex
icans are all without character,
There is a great deal of pride in them
that indescribable Spanish pride of ha-

tuer that will make one of them stick
knife in you for a fancied insult. It
was that sort of feeling that prompt
ed Carranza, the temporary chief of
Mexico (there is no president now)
demand from our government the
ght to cross pur border looking for
bandits before allowing our troops to
cross into Mexico. My friend says
there are many honest, truthful peo
ple among tbem, as well as kindness
and hospitality. " They are very fond
of music and dancing, and one of the
oveliest songs I ever heard is the
Mexican song "La Paloma" (the dove);
melody worthy of any nation, and
which will live longer than much more
pretentious music; Whoever has
heard its tinkling notes in the "ha
bnern" measure, beginning: Sol-sol,-
ni-sol-la-si-do," la-si-, sol-fa;-re-fa-mi-do-re-si
do,-si-la- sol-la- si
re-do can hardly lorget it; the poe
try of old Spain; the sultry glamor of a
tropicnoon; the odor of ' orange
flowers and the glance of black amor
ous eyes, are all in' that wonderfu
sone. and in another air. "Las Golon-
drinas, (the swallowls) which is said
to be the Mexican national air.
Meanwhile," let' us remember the
brave U. S. troopers who are ciamber-
ering over those hot rocks in Chihua
hua and wish them good luck in cap
turing Francisco Villa, for whom,
dead or alive, a reward of $100,000 is
offered.
This hunt for , Villa is no child's
play Is is costing our government
fifty dollars a minute, or about -sev
enty-five thousand dollars a day. That
will be a good investment, however,
if it results in maintaining good order
along our frontier. . I heard a letter
read the other day from a man in
Mexico, who said times were fairly
good, and money plentiful although
food was pretty high. He wrote
that coffee cost him $75 a cup and
flour $1,000 a sack. It mu3t oe re
membered, ' however, that Mexican
money, that is. paper currency, is
worth only three cents on the dollar
You can get nice, clean Mexican "bil-
letas de diez pesos," or ten-dollar bills.

ident whose murder precipitated the
present civil war down there. It is
rieht pretty stuff, but nobody wants
it except as a curosity.
