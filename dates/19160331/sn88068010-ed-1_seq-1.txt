First Missourian is Banqueted.
Farewell Impressive
Hon. D. R. Francis left for
his post as Ambassador of the
United States at St. Petersburg,
Russia, Saturday and the entire
country wishes him a safe voy
age. -
s His many business associates
in St. Louis assembled to do
honor to the most distinguished
Missourian, and there were nota
bles from other points over the
country at the great banquet.
A second banquet and reception
was tendered the new Ambassa
dor just before he left, and that
the business as well as the social
interests of St. Louis and the
state will miss the greatest ex
ecutive citizen of the country
today more than that of any in
the government, there will be
none to deny. "
Governor Francis selection for
the very important post at any
time more especially at this
time when the great nation is
struggling now for its independ
ence and keeping this country
on tenter hooks of international
relationships interwined with
neutrality, was a most notable
instance of President Wilson's
determination to place only the
highest qualities in position of
importance.

Missouri Boy Poet.
Duncan Cox, a 11 year old
school boy of St. Joseph, is a sure
enough juvenile poet Some of
his verses are excellent. He is
a fine looking l&d and all boy.
He delights in baseball and such
sports and will leave a poem any
where in its construction to go
for a game of any kind. He is
an inveterate reader of the Scien
tific American and Popular Me
chanics magizines, yet has a pen
chant for the poets as well. His
memory for dates, objects and
scenes is unsual for a child, and
long after he has been on a trip
he will write a verse on some
feature of it
His ambition at present is to
be a boy scout, and he is impa-
tient to reach his 12th. year that
he may join He wants to go to
Annapolis and become one cf the
navy.
Duncan has had many of his
verses published in the leading
magazines, and the Sunday Kan
sas City Star reproduced several
of them together with lengthy
comments ou the already famous
school boy.

A
Wilbur Lee Took Strychnine.
No Cause is Known.
Only Child.
We have taken from the notes
of
our Salisbury correspondtnt
the following account of the
death of a highly esteemed young
man who was popular among his
acquaintances here as well as at
his home town.
"Wilbur, the 20 year old son of
erry Lee, the garage man, well
a a . .
known about town, committed
suicide Friday morning, by tak
ing a large dose of strychnine;
dying in a few minutes. He ar
rived at the Morehead hotel in
the latter part of the night but
did not retire to a room, but
rested temporarily on a cot, un
til breakfast time, when lighting
a cigar, he went out. and a short
time after was found in convul
sions, at bis father's garage and
died soon after being found. No
adequate cause is assigned for
his rash act, only a few nebulous
rumors being afloat, and it may
never be definitely known why
he should wish to destroy him
self. His boyhood companions
speak well of him and his death
is deeply deplored. After funer
al services at the home of Mrs.
Wilson, the remains were ship
ped to Arthur, 111., for inter
ment. We regret the tragic
death of this promising
man, and extend to his
young i
tather
and relatives such consolation as
we can in their hour of bereave
ment. He had much to live for,
but for some reason life's bur
den proved too heavy for him.
William Clark
William Clark, a pioneer of
this town, who came here in the
latter part of the sixties from
Canada, with his brother, John,
died at the home of his daughter
at Parkville on Sunday last, and
remains arrived here for burial
Tuesday on No. 2, and were laid
to rest beside those of his wife,
with the rites of Masonry. De
ceased was about 71 years of age
and had been a widower for sev
eral years. - After his wife died
he sold out here and went to
Yates, Mo , where he clerked in
a store for some time and thence
to Roanoke where he spent the
latter part of his life. Bill
Clark, as his intimate friends
used to call him, was a smooth,
well balanced man, highly re
spected, trust worthy in all
things, and received official hon
ors at the hands of his f ellowmen.
He ran for the office of County
Treasurer at one time, but was
defeated for the nomination and
retired from politics. He leaves
a son and daughter, some rela
tives here and in Canada, with a
host of friends to mourn his
death and regret his passing
His brother John who came here
with him, when a young man, is
somewhere in west and did not
attend the burial. May the clods
rest lightly upon his tomb!

Editor Byerly
In his manifesto in the first
issue of Chariton Recorder, after
taking it over last week, editor
A. J. Byerly paid a high com
pliment to his predecessor and
exhibited due modesty in his
public statement concerning his
intentions.
Mr. Byerly is an old hand at
the business of editing and man
aging newspapers and that he
is a good business man shows
forth in his dealings already.
He will publish a Democrat
paper, stand for all that is good
for the city and be one of us,
and we heartily welcome him
and his family.
Mr. Byerly asks only for a
fair division of the patronage of
the community and county and
we trust that it will be unhesi
tatingly accorded him.

last week after visiting her chil
dren in Oklahoma, New Mexico
and Colorado several months.
She was called home on account
of the illness of her grand-son,
Carl Cook.
Our school house had a close
call from destruction by fire last
week. The fire caught in two
places in the roof, probably due to
some light material having been
thrown in the stove, and thrown
out on the roof by the strong
draught of the flue. The dam
age will amount to probably
$20.00.
Martin McAdams and wife of
Columbia Mo. visited relatives in

Rev. B. A. Pugh, Baptist min

meeting here this week with

ting some of the tangles straigh
tened out.
Carl Cook, son of Andrew
Cook, died Tuesday, March 21,
after an illness of many years
with a complication of troubles.
He was buried the following day
at Beulah cemetery, funeral ser
vices were conducted by Rev.
Thompson, assisted by Revs.
Pugh and Bellon. The long funer
al procession and a church pack
ed to overflowing attested the
respect and admiration for this
young man by his neighbors and
friends. The bereaved family
have the sympathy of the entire
community.
Will Graves was sick last Sun
day, threatened with pneumonia,
but managed to scare it away,
but he had just about recovered

be something contagious.

VILLA HAS ESCAPED
Eludes Pursuers When Cornered.
False Reports Made
Army Divided.
General Pershing, command
ing in the field in Mexico, tired
of the dilatory action of the
Carranza troops and left them
with a picked force to close in
on a point where the rebel chief
was reported to have stopped to
recuperate hi3 men and horses.
Col. Dodds colum of cavalry
went on the west side of the
mountain range and Gen. Persh
ing remained on the eastern side,
both seeking the outlaw where
he was reported to have been
only a short march ahead of the
pursuers. That Villa is in the
Sierra Madre mountains at all is
a matter of considerable doubt,
for false reports have been
given all along by Mexicans
supposed to be favorable to the
capture of the bandit. One thing
appears to be certain, and that
Villa is headed for the country
where he has confederates under
Canuto Reyss in considerable
numbers, and it is conceded that
if the bandit chief forms a junc
tion with Reyes, it will be a
most difficult matter to capture
him. It is therefore that Gen.
Pershing is doubling his efforts
to overtake the sleek desperado
before he gets further. The
American troops are suffering
intensely from various causes,
yet push on intrepidly after the
quarry. The greatest care is
being taken to keep out of an
ambuscade, the country being
most favorable for such surprise,
and Villa's method of fighting
being of the bushwacker sort
when he has not enough men
and munitions to come out in the
open and fight.
The seriousness of the situa
tion is not minimized at Washing
ton, and the outcome of the
undertaking is looked upon with
much concern by the adminis
tration, especially Senator Stone,
L. W. Hansman returned from
a visit to his sister and Fritz in
St. Louis Tuesday. . Louie says
nix on the city as a place to live,
and he says Fritz is of the same
way of thinking. He, Louie, saw
a fine gamp of ball between the
Cards and Browns Sunday.
Old Illinoy Mason
C. N. Butt who formerly
owned the fine 320 acre farm
between this city and Salisbury
and which now belongs to Mc
Nutt Welch and Clarence Gehr
hart is the third oldest A. F. &
A. M. in Illinois, having joined
the order July 8, 1854. Mr,
Butt is nearly 83 years old. and
.t . .
yet active in lodee and municipa
affairs at his home town
Knoxville. Mr. Butt 'is also
R. A. C. and Council mason.
The Knox County Republican
dated March 16 has a splended
cut of Mr. Butt in uniform
Master Mason, and also a good
write up of the veteran.
The editor of the Courier was
a guest at the home of the hospit
able pioneer of Knox county
about 1876 when he was there
to assist in bringing to this
county a lot of horses exchanged
in the deal for the farm mention
ed. The culinary accomplish
mentsof Mrs. Butt will ever be
remembered by James J. Ward
and the editor, especially her
brand of apple dumplings,
which Jim never failed to make
away with four or five every
time he got a chance at them.
May- the good people live to
round out a century of life and
be remembered by all their ol
acquaintances with as great
pleasure as we feel when they
are frequently called to mind.
European War.
Fighting along the hundred
mile front in the east as well as
around Verdun in the west is
most terrific. 80,000 are report
ed to have been lost in one en
gagement by the Russians this
week, and the German losses
near Verdun have been heavy.
Nearly a dozen ships have
been sunk in one way or another
within the week, Germany losing
three. On a merchant ship con
verted into an auxilliary cruiser
which was sunk in the English
Channel, there were more than
hundred Americans and strange
to say, the majority women. It
is a matter of enquiry as to
what sunk the ship, but there is
some suspicion that mines which
had been planted by the English,
have bern torn from their moor
ings ana were encountered by
several of the ships which have
been sunk rather mysterinosly.
The latter part of last week
here was a sea battle in the
north sea between British and
German war ships, and the
fight resulted in what seems
about a draw, both sides losing
vessels.
As the German warship was
going down under the fire of an
English man-of-war, she shot a
torpedo and sunk the English
fighter.
The following births within
the past week; girl, Mr. and
Mrs. Ercel Hayes; girl, Mr. and

emple; boy, Mr. and Mrs. Leo
Smith.
Willard Still Champion
Saturday night the successful
white hope again proved his
prowess in the ring by easily de
feating the next fighter in the
world, Jess Willard, after break
ing his right hand in the third
round winning every round with
points to spare against Frank
Moran, a blond boxer from Jer
sey. The headlines of the papers
say that the third round in which
Willard broke his hand was in
favor of Moran, but the detail of
the round does not bear out the
claim. Here it is: "Willard
smashed a right into Morans
body, doubling Moran up.
Morans savage swings could not
reach Willards jaw. ' Willard
jabbed Moran with his left al
most at will. Moran grew shaky
under the punching. Willard
ducked two right swings and
laughed. Moran swung a right
to the body as the bell rung.
Morans round." Morans parti
sans can lay claim to the round if
they desire.
Willard weighed in at 259
pounds and Moran 201 i. Willard
was five inches taller and had
much longer reach, but no more
pluck. Willard had no visible
marks at the end of the fight
while Moran had one eye badly
cut, nose dislocated and bunged
up generally. Madison Square
Garden New York City had
every one of the 13000 seats filled.
Some of the most prominent men
in the country were present and
many notable women. Jim Cor
bett Fitzsimmons and John L.
Sullivan, all champions in their
day, were on hand and each
when introduced, got an ovation
which thrilled the gladiators,
Jno. L coming in for the lions
share. Jim Jeffries was not
there?
The receipts were $151,25100,
of which Willard got $47,500,00,
Moran $23,750,00, the State of
New York $11,344,05, expenses
of the fight about $100,000 and
Tex Richard and Sara McCrackin,
the promoters $50,000: The
state gets 7 per cent of gate
receipts for permitting fights.
