Douglas, Ariz., March 29. A more
optimistic feeling than has been ex
hibited since the American punitive
expedition crossed the Chihuahua bor
der with orders to kill or capture Villa
was apparent on both sides of the
border today following receipt of the
news that General Carranza had giv
en permission for' the passage of food
supplies for the United States puni

has been evident among Americans
and Mexicans alike over the possible
outcome of the railroad situation ap
parently has been dissipated.

THE FIRST SUMMER
SPRAYING OF APPLES
Timely Articles by Ashleigh P. Boles,
Horticultural Agent
The time for applying the Cluster
Bud Spray of apple trees will soon be
here. Within. the next two or three
weeks the buds will be properly separ
ated for the, Cluster Bud Spraying.
It is practically impossible to contol
apple scab and spring canker worm
without this spray.
A one page circular giving detailed
instructions for mixing and applying
the Cluster Bud Spray and the ap
proximate date for its application will
be sent to all formers who are now
getting the Frisco Department of De
velopment Horticultural circulars, and
all Others who will send in their
names. A similar circular will be
sent for each of the later sprayings.
Last year several large orchards
were completely defoliated as a result
of leaving off the Cluster Bud Spray
ing. A formula of two gallons of
lime-sulphur and 2V2 pounds of arsen
ate of lead paste (or 1 pounds of
dry arsenate of lead powder) to 60
gallons of water has been used for
several years in the demonstration
work and has been highly satisfactory
for the Cluster Bud Spray. ,
The Department of Development of
the Frisco Railroad has been doing
demonstration work alongs its lines
for the last three years. This work
will be continued along the same lines
during 1916. There are' several or
chard men in the neighborhood of Mo
nett who are handling one acre or
more of their apple orchard under the
direction of this Department of the
railroad. , These men are interested in
Overalls and Jackets in the Genuine German Blueat
GALLOWAY CLOTHING COMPANY
showing as large a net profit as possi
ble from their orchards, and in order
to know just how much it costs to pro
duce apples in the Ozarks they are
keeping a complete record of the cost
of all of the work which is clone in
the demonstration plat. These figures
will be wovth a great deal to the men
who are doing, this work, and to all
others who are interested in growing
apples in the Ozarks. The records
kept by the Demonstration Orchard
men last year under the direction of
the Department of Development show
nt profits ranging from $40.00 to
$450.00 per acre. You may not re
alize a large net profit the first year

from spraying, but you will build up
your orchard so that it will be pos
sible to make very satisfactory net
profits in the years to come.
;The names of the orchard men who
are handling demonstration plats in
the Monett territory are as follows:
. JLoren Withers, Monett, Mo.
D. E. Brite, Monett, Mo.
jC. B. Peck, Monett, Mo.
John Planchon, Monett, Mo.
Grant Bennett, Monett, Mo.
You are invited to watch the work
that is being done in these orchards
and form your own conclusions as to
the value of up-to-date methods of
orcharding in this neighborhood.
