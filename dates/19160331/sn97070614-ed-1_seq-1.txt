HIQfl WATER
M) Great Damage But Much Incon
venience In Spring Break up.
The real starting of spring came
Monday when the melting snow and
ice and heavy rains filled the gutters
and sewers, and then the creeks and
rivers, the Shiawassee river gradually
Attaining the highest point in high
water in twelve years, but as there was
little ice the damage, was small, mostly
from goods in cellars of houses and
buildings along the river bank. Plenty
of time was given to make arrange
ments and few were nn prepared. Res
idents of the third ward near the river
are the worst suSerera, and several
have been compelled to go back and
forth from their houses in boats.
Alarm was created by tba usual false
newspaper scares that the water works
might be enable to run, but as usual
there was little damage and that has
cow entirely passed.
Ice jams were not serious although
dynamiting was resorted to at Corunna
aud much fear was felt for the foot
bridge to the Ann Arbor shops for a
fe r hours, aud Hawkins bridge south
of Corunna was threatened, but all the
ice was finally disposed of.
' Many cellars, including the basement
cf the sew Lincoln school and the Car
negie library had some wster in them
but little damage resulted.
The water was high at the brick
plant at Kerby. Tuesday, and a alight ,
further rise would have filled the work
ings at the coal mines and shale beds
and stopped work for the season, but
as with the many other might have
foeens the flood stepped in lima

OWOSSO MANUFACTURES
Census Bureau's Summary for 1914.
Washington. D. C. March 30.
re-sulti-.of the census of manufac
tures for Owosso. Mich., has been is
sued by Director -Sam L. Rogers, of
the bureau of the census, depart
ment of commerce.
The census excludes the hand
trades, the building trades, and the
neighborhood industries, and took
account only of establishments con
ducted under the factory system.
Statistics "were not collected for es
tablishments having products for the
census year valued at less than f 500
The reports -were taken for the
calendar year ending December SI,
mi.
Summary of Statistic.
The statistics represent the estab
lishments located -within the corpor
ate limits of the city.
The capital invested -was f 4,1 47,
000. The cost of materials used was'
fl.$51,0. In addition to the com
ponent materials which enter into
the products of the establishment;
for the census year there are Includ
ed the cost of fuel, mill supplies, and
rent of power and heat. The cost
of materials, however, does not in
clude unused materials, and supplies
bought either for speculation or for
use during a subsequent period.
The value of products, which
amounted to fS,4i,000. represents
their selling value or price at the
plants as actually turned out by
the factories during the census year
and does not necessarily have any
relation to the amount of sales for!
that year. The values under this
bead also include amounts received
for work done on materials furnish
ed by others.

Refuses a Demurrer.
Judge Nelson Sharpe, who beard the
argument for a demurrer In the case cf
F. J. North way of Dnrand vs. The
Union Telephone Co. in the Shiawas
see circuit court some weeks ago, has
refused to grant the demurrer and the
case may now ccme to triaL Northway
failed to pay his telephone rental until
after the fifteenth of the first month of
the quarter and then refused to pay the
extra fifty cents charged in such cases
and secured an it j auction to prevent
the company from taking out his tele
phone. The company asked a dissolu
tion cf the injunction, having previ
ously filed a demurrer cn the ground
that there was no equity in Mr. North
wij'i bilL that he had an adequate
remedy at law, and that the matter ;
was under the jurisdiction cf the state
railroad commission; that the contract
was net in writiDg and is not set forth
by the plaintiff with tuficient particu
larity to recover; that the bill of com
plaint does not aver that the $5 53
demanded was in excess of the fran
chise rate, burwa? an additional and
reasonable charge for neglect to pay the
telephone bill when due.
Judge Sharpe concedes that the case
is similar to the case' of the City of
Owosso against the company which was
decided by the supreme court in favor
of the company,' but states there are
additional questions involved. ,

an answer from Mr. Roosevelt is fer
vently desired.
Altogether it i a novel situation in
wLLeh the Republican party finds
itself on the eve of the presidential

three bir men of the jarty. Hushe,

TRADE AT HOME. .
.
. The 'Glenwod Opiiiira, published jt
Glexiwood, Iowa, voniains a flattering
notice of the first prize won by Dr.
H. L. Lyon in present ins 10 reasons
why we should trade at Lome. Tie
reasons are as follows;
2. Ik-caus-e every dollar -omes back
to you quicker, thus jayins; interest.
Not one cent is rained when the dol
lar Je.aveyour city.
2. If home merchant were sure of
your trade, they could afford to carry
larser and better supply.
3. If
you pay cash same as to
mail order house, home merchants
could sell on a closer marsin.
i. Because if bousht at Lome you
know exactly what you are buyins,
and .if not satisfactory, borne mer
chants will make it risht. ,
5. It makes the customer feel a
keener interest in his home town when
i nce
re-lioirjf.
ets the habit of tradins at
(i. Because we should help our
friends, and our best friends are those
who help us in times when we are out
of work by extendins credit home
merchants.
It would increase the value of
our projerty.
S. It will enable all of us to pay
our debts. You buy your neit bill of
Sd5 at hoiue. and th home merchant
takes that money and. pays the coal
man. the coal man jays the butcher,
the butcher pays the dentist, Ibe dent
ist pays the rent, the landlord pays
the doctor, and the doctor pays you
for the cow he bargained f or. When
would your money s have relured t o
you had you sent out of town for
wour p.Kds? Xot in a hundred years.
It would stimulate a better spirit
in the community, and all would fed
a merited pride in our city, and kou
we would have a Glen wood Beauti
ful of which we would all be proud,
bocause we started this movement of
trade at home.
10. Because it is a family a5air,
and no community can be at its best
unless all tie family pull toretber.
3riends, trade at home, and vou will
think more of yourself, your neigh
bor, and be a bissrr booster for your
