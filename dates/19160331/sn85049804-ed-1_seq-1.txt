There are 123 delegates in attendance
and we are pleased to note an in
crease of thirteen of our race with
the delegation. At one of the ses
sions a colored hodcarrier was pres
ent and addressed the convention, also
Mr. Geo. H. Edwards, a national or
ganizer, who has been incarcerated in
the Polk county jail for over one year
waiting trial for trying to bring
about peace in the Colorado strike
two years ago, was allowed to ad
dres the convention. Also Miss Flora

an's suffrage was highly received. We
are are glad to note that of thirteen
colored delegates Mr. Wm. M. Brown
of Buxton was elected one of the

PRINTING PRICES HIGHER.
The general printing and j,ob work
prices have all been compelled to
be raised on account of raw material
prices increasing. In fact we print
ers cannot get some of the colors in
paper neither can we get white pa
per for our newspaper. All on ac
count of the European war. In fact
all raw material costs have Increased
from one-half to two-thirds of the
former cost. Therefore hereafter the
price of all job work will be greatly
increased. The Bystander this year
has received more job work and ad
vertising than in any previous year.
We have one law firm legal brief
which makes hundreds of pages, also
one secret society (white) that gave
us two jobs of 50,000 run, and last
week we received the annual minutes
of Oziel Grand Chapter of O. E. S. of
New Jersey. This is one of the larg
est that we ever received that has
come so far. We do good work and
the people are beginning to know that
fact.
REFUSE TO SALUTE OUR FLAG.
A little boy of only 7 years old has
come into the lamplight. His name
is Hubert Eaves. .He has abso
lutely refused his teacher in the pub
lic school, also the city superintend
ent, to salute the flag because he says
that his religion and Christian train
ing taught him to salute nothing but
God. He was arrested, expelled from
school, tried in the juvenile court
yesterday, found guilty and sent to
reform school. Later the judge re
mitted the sentence provided the
father would give him a private
teacher to secure an education. The
Chicago Daily Sunday Tribnue and
many other daily papers had a write
up about it. We can see no wrong
in failing to salute our flag so long
as it was against his religion. We
ought to be free to worship God ac
cording to the dictates of our con
science, but under the peculiar laws
of Iowa, chapter 144, laws of 35th G.
A., a certain drill -requires a salute
to our flag.
