Following investigations of

United States ' revenue agent,
government action already has
been taken against two Bridge

in a town near here, and
Bridgeport druggist. -
Violations of the Harrison

": -Foi" several months a special agent
of the government has been, making
! investigations in this cits, aided, by
the State i'narmajcy association. .The
records of every drug store have been
-examined closely, comparisons were
' made with the records of manufac-
turers of narcotics, and suspected
. Physicians were made the subject of
rigid espionage. ; - '
:x As a Tesult, during the last few
, weeks, reports nave been made to the
Revenue Depaitment that implicate
persons well known in the medical
. profession and one r druggist.
i '. One case is- so serious , that it is
likely a prosecution will -be resorted
to. - In the others, the suspects have
been notified that .the government -has
evidence: of a damaging nature and
they should show cause why, they
should not be fined the amount . stimu
lated in . the law. '-,'.
"Faking" records will be one count
against one physician. It will be al
leged that ; while his records show he
purchased a fram of narcotics on a
certain, date, the manufacturer's rec-,
ord shows , that . the amount was an
ounce. ' - V
"Dope flends' are assumed to have
received the "dope" not recorded. The
tendency of the evidence against this
physician will be to prove he his been
supplying victims of drugs with nar
cotics in a manner contrary to law
.and has bailed t make a. record of his
dispensations. , -
Similar charges will be made against
the others. The druggust may suffer
a loss of his pharmacy license.
The quiet 'action of the Federal au
thorities in hls city is known to be
one of the first acts of the revenue de
partment, collaborating with the State
Pharmacy association, to wipe out an,
insidious traffic that has, prospered irt
Bridgeport despite the clean-up made
-' by state officials during the last two
years. - t
Notwithstanding the great - penalty
that might be inflicted under the new
est Federal laws, some physicians and
! a druggist or two have carried on the
' trade withlope users. Scores -of the
, latter have left the city, but a few re
main whq are willing to take chances'.

FIRST CLASS W
POSTAISERVIGE
Postmaster Chas. F. Greene
Will Have $200 Raise .
In Salary.
WJth a surplus, of more than $2,000,
the ' postal receipts of Bridgeport for
the 'fiscal year - ending today, passed
the $450,000 mark. This figure places
the Bridgeport office in what'is known
as the- "first class," in which only
leading cities of the country are rated.
Incldentally.Postrnaster C. F.Greene's
salary hereafter will be $4,000 a year
instead of $3,800 and it is expected
that the salary of each of the super
visory officials will-be advanced con
siderably. The amount is $452,254.60, which
includes only postal receipts.' It is an
increase of . $82,971.99 over the year
ending. March 31, 1915. At that time
the receipts totaled $369,282.61.
For a long . time, postal officials
dared only hope to pass the $400,000
mark,- but as the year increased and I
there was a continual large growth in
the receipts, they began to look am
bitiously toward the $450,000 mark.
During the past few weeks it was
feared that the figures would short
by a couple of thousand, but the last
few days carried them well over the
coveted mark. '
This splendid figure gives an entire
ly new standing to the city, postal
wise. It shows how the city is grow
ing and is eventually on its way to be
coming the metropolis of Connecticut.
It also means that a larger working
force will be granted to the local office.

American government until
such facts had been received
and that , no action' leading to

evidence was established that

Officials declared, they were not
worried because they had not heard
from Ambassador Gerard, who was in

submarine torpedoed the steamers
Sussex..-and Englishman. -' They added
that they would not be surprised if
they did not hear from the ambassador
for another day or two.
Meanwhile, the situation may accur
ately be described as a waiting one.
Aside from, the slowness of communi
cation between Washington and Ber
lin, it was pointed out today that the
American minister may not have car
ried- his request to the foreign office
while it was engaged in the delicate
situation 'in the German Reichstag
over the submarine policy, which has
been likened to the situation in the
American congress over the armed
ship controversy. , "
Count Von Bernstorffthe German
ambassador, v delayed presenting a
communication to the state depart
ment for two days while the adminis
tration was engaged in a fight with
Congress, and it ' was suggested today
that Mr.' Gerard, confronted by a
similar situation, may have taken a
similar course.
Chairman Stone said that no com
plications in the situation inspired his
call, early today, upon Secretary Lan
sing. . ' ' '
The fact that Chairman Flood, of
the House committee was also at the
department was a mere coincidence,"
said he, explaining that he had gone
to the department only to secure only"
additional information on the situa
tion. "I found that the secretary of state
had nothing more than- I already
Had," he' said.
Chairman Stone stated emphatically
there was. nothing involving Congress
at present and that Secretary Lan

' Back to Port.
'Lewes, Del., March 31. The young
German .who captured the British
steamer Matoppo and terrorized her
crew of 56 men on Wednesday night,
shortly after the ship had sailed out
of New York harbor for Vladivostok
with railroad supplies for the Russian
government, declared today that he
was a sp'y Xor the German govern
ment. - . ' -
Ernest Schiller, the prisoner, weary
from all the excitement He had under
gone in his efforts to escape from the
stamer yesterday after he had held
the crew in his power with pistols all
of Wednesday night, threw himself
upon -a cot in' the Lewes Jail early to
day and sought sleep.
"Yes, I am a spy for the German
government," he said. "You can be
lieve it or not it makes no difference
to me. I got my instructions from the
German government to-go aboard the
ship and blow J)er up-to- prevent her
cargo .from reaching- Russia. I could
have blown her up but the captrin's
plea for his wife and daughter was
too much for, me and I hadn't the
heart to do it. I am ready to take the
consequences but I ask that they keep
me ashore instead of sending me back
to. the vship ; f or the captain to take
charge tpt me." .
Schiller had been told that as his
daring exploit ,. occurred outside the
three-mile limit he would in all , like
lihood be taken to British possessions
in the West Indies for trial for piracy.
Federal authorities - and representa
tives from the. -British government
came here today to examine Schiller
and to decide what to do with him.
If -the United States finds it has no Ju
disdttetion under international marl
time law he will .be turned over to the
representatives of Great Britain.
An examination into Schiller's men
tal condition will be made. Those
who have talked With him believe he
irresponsible and that his . story
of his career is, not true. Schiller
"was reluctant to I tell his history.
I was born in Germany," he said.
"Never mind thetown or my parents'
name. i was sent oy me-, uerman
government to England soon after the
war started and enlisted in the Brit
ish navy and was assigned to the
training ship ' Conway at Liverpool.
I want to say right now that there
are several good Germans in the Brit
ish navy. .
- "I know what this means to me. It';
the Tower of London if they get me
back to the Matoppo. But I won't go.
just ibear that in mind."
Captain Richard Bergner, of the Ma
toppo, said he was convinced tocnii-
ler was a. former British naval ora-
r. . ''
Despite his assertions that he had
not concealed any .bombs on the Ma
toppo and- that he made threats to
blow up the. ship merely td frighten
the captain and crew into obeying his
commands, a 'thorough Investigation
of the cargo of barbed wire and farm
implements will be made before the
essel proceeds on its voyage to Vla
divostok. -
I sDent three weeks in Hoboken

went along the docks buying- drinks
for the sailors and learning from
them' what ships were sailing wiu

oner after he had been captured by

that he believes the man is mentally

John D. Cooper and Gas En
gine Expert Are Flung In
to Iqy Waters of Sound
When Forward Pontoon
Crashes Into Unexpected
Obstacle.
Passenger Sayes' Inventor,
Stunned By Being Flung
Against Steering . Wheel,
, and Lighthouse Keeper
Rescues Both From Float
ing Wreckage.
In view of hundreds of De-'
destrians lining the seawall, at
Seaside park, John Dale Cooper,
540 Seaview avenue, builder of
a new type of military hydro
aeroplane, and Ivan Stengel, of
Montclair, N. J., a gas engine
expert, fell from their aero
plane into the outer harbor at
10:15 this morning, when the
forward pontoon of the dipping
craft struck a piece; of -driftwood
and wrecked the machine.
Flung violently against the
steering post, Cooper was ren
dered almost helpless. But for
the timely aid. of Stengel, who
struck out sturdily through the '
icy waters and seized Cooper by'
the hair, the inventor might i
have perished. Stengel helped:
Gooper to a piece of the wreck!
Which helped them to keep ;
afloat until many minutes later,
Keepeft 'iialdwin of the Bridge- :
port light reached them with a
rowboat. -
The machine, buoyed by its pon
toons, remained afloat, but was so
seriously crippled that it was towed
ashore in sections. Cooper, not much
the worse for his experience, this af- j
ternoon said he believed $200 would '
cover the damage. j
This is not Cooper's first close' call ;
from death. ' He has had an adventur- j
ous career. Famous first as a bicycle j
racer, he entered the realm of aeron- j ,
autics at the Curtiss school at Ham- !
mondsport, N. Y... where he mastered
aviation so thoroughly that Glenn M.
Curtiss selected him for the import- i
ant mission of introducing the Curtiss j
biplane in the Russian army.' Scores !
of aviators of the Russian army owe I
their skill with 'aircraft to Cooper's ,'
instruction, for he remained abroad
many months schooling- the Czar's
soldiery in the intricacies of navigat
ing (the air.
The machine wrecked this morning
is designed for military Nuse. Thrice
had the inventor and" his passenger
arisen many feet above the water,"
then dipped gracefully. They had
circled the lighthouse, and were re
turning towards the hangar, near the
Connecticut Co.'s. powerhouse in Sea-
view avenue, when Cooper decided to
dip once more. The machine carri3
a pontoon fore and aft.
As the craft, skimming over the
water, settled into the harbor, the
forward pontoon .crashed into a log
of driftwood, and the buoyant support
was torn, from the structure. Instantly
the forward part was submerged, an4
in the sudden halting of the craft,:
which was making nearly a mile a
minute. Cooper was thrust forward
so violently upon the steering wheel j
that the breath left his body. . j
Sttfngel was perched on the stabil- j
izer, or tail, of the machine, and i
though he was tossed into the water, I
he escaped contact with the wreckage, j
and was quickly at the side of Cooper,
who was bobbing about almost help- .
less in Jthe icy water. "
Baldwin raced , through the calm (
waters of the outer harbor in his little I
rowboat, and in a few minutes reach-
ed' the imperiled twain. Cooper had j
recovered from the shock of his col- j
lision with the steering apparatus,, and ;
except for a bruise on the face, was
not hurt. Stengel had no injuries.
News of the mishap quickly reached
the Bridgeport, Towing Co.'s office.)
Robert Ferrett, the manager, hastened i
out on the tug Robert McAllister with :
CaptaiVi Frank Hancort, but before
they reached the scene the men had
beeen rowed ashore, on" Seaview ave-;
nun. bv the lighthouse keeper.
Employes of the employment office
of the Locomobile Co. of America wit
nessed the accident. They sent a hur- ;
rled a-ll for help to police headquar
ters and the automobile patrol wagon
with Driver Denis, Toolan and Police
men Simon McCullough and Samuel
Gregory and Sergt. James O'Neil hur
ried to the seawall at Seaside nark. .
Several lines of rope were brought
along in the patrol wagon. There was
no ambulance called. t
The trip this morning was 4he first
to be made in the ship with a new
equipment. Cooper had just installed
two 9 0 h. p. engines, and when he saw
the weather conditions this morning,
ne decided To try them out at once.
The trip was highly successful, until
the last dip brought the pontoon into
collision with the drift wood.
The wrecked plane was towed to the
hangar shed this afternoon and will
be repaired by the workmen employed
there. The plane Is valued at several
