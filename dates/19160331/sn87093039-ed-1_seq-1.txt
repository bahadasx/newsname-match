DIVERSIFIED FARMING
AND TRUCK GARDENING
Success on the Land Depends on Oiver
• sification, Stock Raising and
Kitchen Gardening
A recent bulletin from the U. S. Ag
ricultural Department urged upon all
who depended in any way on cultiva
tion of the soil, including dairying,
stockraising, poultry raisins, fruit grow
ing—in short, all who lire on the land
and depend on it for a living or profit,
to diversify as much as their circura
■Urices and surroundings will permit.
Up to a few years ago the apple
grower of the Wenatchee valley de
pended solely on his apple crop to pay
for everything the family required. Not
on» apple grower in ten diversified to
the extent of having a garden. He
went to town for the potatoes, peas,
com, cabbage, lettuce —in fact, every
vegetable that came to his table was
paid for out of the returns on his ap
ple*. It is true that the apple business
was then highly profitable and for a
time stood a heivy burden of house
bold expense and still left a margin.
But this very fact helped to reduce the
price of apples. The enormous profits
induced so many to engage in the oc
cupation that the supply of high-priced
fruit exceeded the demand. When
the money stringency hit the country
five or six years ago all but a few rich
people were compelled to buy cheaper
fruit, and there were not enough well-to
do people to consume all the higher
priced article. Now, if the apple
grower had cultivated a garden 25x75
feet, enough ground to supply the aver
age family with all the vegetables re
quired thru the summer and put some
away for winter, and put the money
spent for these table necessities in a
stocking for a rainy day, he could have
pulled thru the slump in the apple in
dustry. Now do nut say this could not
have been done on so small a plot of
ground. It has been done repeatedly.
All by a little work early in the morn
ing and late in the evening. Oftimes
by children under the direction of
father or mother. Of course the ground
was enriched and the cultivation was
along intensive lines. As soon as one
thing matured and came of! something
else was planted in its place. No spot
was allowed to remain idle during the
growing season.
The dairyman who goes to town for
all his cow feed can not prosper long.
The high price of butterfat may stand
the strain for a time, but there will
come a time when the price of butter
fat will go down for some reason and
then the business will not stand for all
the feed from town. And then, too,
jast about that time the price of feed
may for one cause or another be unus
ually high, which happens to be the
case just now.
Whatever occupation you follow, Mr.
Man-on-the Land, do not.pin all your
faith to one line of activity. If you
rai«e chickens, also raise your feed for
them, or as much of it as possible.
Keep one or two cows, a few pigs and,
by all means, have a garden. If you
are on the land, whatever your chief
occupation may be, do not neglect the
garde*. It will save you $100 to 8150
every year. The more sidelines you
have the better and safer. Some may
(ail you, they nearly always do, from
lotne cause beyond your control. But
they will not all fail. They very rarely
do that. We knew a small farmer
once, and he was a hustler, too, but
his pigs died, one of his cows died and
the other dried up on him, and he was
feeling awfully blue, but he Kept right
on. In the late summer he sowed a
half acre of turnips. The ground was
rich, the season favored him and that
fall turnips happened to be scarce in
the neighborhood. He had a fine /rop
and received almost two hundred dol
lars for the turnips from his half acre
that fall and winter. Do not give up
because everything does not come up
to your expectations. That happens to
nxttt if not all of us every year. Re

POSSIBILITIES Of DAIRYING
IN STATE Of WASHINGTON
i
A Growing Industry With a Limitless
Future
There has been so much said and
written about the west and so many
theories advanced as to the best meth
ods for the utilization of the vast area
of logged-off lands lying thru-out the
northwest, and in it all there seems to
be a thotoly well defined idea that
dairying is the proper answer and the
ultimate happy destiny.
Hitherto we have imported large
quantities of butter to supply local de
mands. However, the balance of trade
marked a decided change during the
year Just passed, as the state exported
some three million pounds of butter.
The dairying industry in Washing
ton is only in its infancy —the surface
of the ground has not even been
scratched—the first breath of life has
hardly been taken When it takes a
start it must grow by leaps and bounds
by virtue of the ideal conditions pre
vailing in Washington.
The grasses grow longer and the
climate is milder than in the estab
lished butter and cheese producing dis
tricts of the east, hence a better article
at a cheaper cost should and will be
the result.
What to do with the thousands of
acres of logged-off land lying in Wash
ington has long been a problem. It
should be a problem no longer, as
every acre of it can be brought into
productive use thru the medium of
dairying and kindred industries.
Captain I. M. Howell, secretary of
state, has prepared a little book, for
gratuitous distribution, entitled "Dairy
ing, Poultry and Stock Raising" which
throws a great light on the possibili
ties and opportunities for the success
ful promotion and prosecution of this
lucrative industry. A card addressed
to Captain I. M. Howell, Secretary of
State, Olympia, Washington, will meet
with a cheerful response and briDg a
copy of this valuable little book.
Peshastin Fruit Warehouse Has
Changed Hands
F. A. Wingate, one of the live wires
in the Peshastin apple district, was
here Monday and said to a reporter for
this paper that himself and A. Bigelow
had closed a deal with the Wenatchee
Valley Fruit Growers' Association for
their warehouse at Peshastin, and that
they would conduct it this season as
an independent warehouse. The build
ing is very substantially built and quite
large. Some eighty cars of apples
were handled thru this house the past
season.

THE CITY COUNCIL
EMPLOYS MR. WHITNEY
Will Represent City in Suit Against Sea
man & Quigg Which Has Been
Discussed for Past Year
The city council met in regular ses
sion Tuesday with all members pres
ent. Mr.Woldenberg, who has been in
serious condition since the first meet
ing in January, made his appearance
and took part in the proceedings.
Bills, which were fewer in number
than at any previous meeting, and
amounting to $77.91, were ordered
paid.
The bond o! the State Bank, the
city's depository, for $5000, was ap
proved.
A communication from Kemp & Ba
ker was read in which they agreed to
represent the city in the suit against
Seaman & Quieg for a fee of $500 to
carry it thru the lower couits, and an
additional $150 to carry it to the su
preme court. The offer provoked but
little discussion as the council bad
practically concluded to accept the offer
of W. F. Wnitney at the last meeting.
The contract of Mr. Whitney was
read and on motion was approved and
accepted. The agreement calls for
a $500 retainer; 50 per cent of first
$2,000 or fractional part thereof, in
case the city wins, and 10 per cent of
any sum above that amount. The city
is to pay all costs. The only objec
tion raised was to the 50 per cent
clause. In case of a small judgment
the attorney will reap all the pecuniary
benefit.
The resignation of Police Judge
Graham, handed in at the last meeting,
was accepted. He will probably be
reappointed at the next regular meet
ing when the ordinance, read for third
time and adopted, creating a salary of
$25 for police judge, will be in effect.
The peddlers' and hawkers' ordi
nance passed to its third reading ar>d
was adopted.
A committee, consisling of Hale,
Snyder and Kugelman, were appointed
to devise ways and means of increas
ing the revenues of the city.
Poor old Towser, man's most faithful
fried, was given an awful "bawling"
out. He was condemned in fifty-seven
ways. Some said he was too numer
ous, others that he was careless in his
habits, especially during the deep
snows; that he was a trespasser; that
he barked too long and loud and dis
turbed the community. The marshal
was instructed to do all he could to
relieve conditions and strictly enforce
the ordinance relating to dogs. The
dog pound will be put in shape and
all dogs whose owners fail to pay the
license required will be gathered up
and impounded. They will be held
48 houis when they will put out of ex
istence unless some one pays the tax
and one dollar penalty imposed.
The buiiding committee were in
structed to have the jail repaired and
put in habitable shape, and Mayor Day
has announced his intention of going
after all offenders against our laws with
a sharp stick. Let it be so.
The clerk was instructed to request
the Great Northern railway to have the
big heap of sawdust removed from the
north side of the park. Also to sug
gest that the old half-burned restaurant
added nothing to the beauty of the
landscape.
The contract for the city's printing
for the year beginning April Ist was
awarded to the Leavenworth Echo, its
bid being the only one submitted.
Doctor J. S. Judah and Mrs. Judah
entertained last night at cards in honor
of Mrs. Judah's mother, Mrs. Cannon.
Mr. and Mrs. Cannon expect to leave
in a few days for Butte, Montana.
Bring us pour prescriptions. We
guarantee to give you just what your
doctor orders. Wheeler's drug store.

550 CARS WASHINGTON
LUMBER SHIFT DAILY
Railroads Doing Greatest Lumber Busi
ness in History—All Lines Are
Sharing in Activity
The shipment of war material by way
of the Russian Pacific port of Vladivos
tock, which has not abated in the past
month, is now supplemented with an
enorrrous increase in the east-bound
lumber business. Every transconti
nental road is sharing in the increasing
lumber business, which in the last two
weeks in the.month averaged 550 cars
per day. This is said to be the heavi
est lumber movement in history. That
it will be doubled when all the mills
that are building and others not yet in
operation once get going, is the pre
diction
The Leavenworth mills will, once
they start up, add from twenty to forty
cars per day to the lumber movement.
Postoffice In New Quarters
Tomorrow
Postmaster Hamilton says he will be
gin moving into the new, or rather,
the old quarter* tomorrow. The con
tractor did a good job in reconstructing
the fixtures. Much of the stuff used
was salvaged from the fire of Dec. 26
last, but it has been so repaired and
arranged that it looks better than ever.
It is now a postoffice that the town can
really be proud of.
Contractors Hartman & McKenzie
are putting the finishing touches to the
Investment Company's block. The
room arranged for the garage is com
plete and ready for its occupant, the
Ford agency, which expects to take
charge the first of April. The room
between the garage and the postoffice
has not been engaged, but it is under
stood that an occupant is ready as soon
as the finishing touches to the interior
are completed.
Pointers for Dairy Men
The dairy men of Okanogan county
to the number of fifty-two, says the
Pateros Reporter, have silos, and 150
more are to be constructed there this
summer. Here is a pointer for our
cow owners. A silo doubles the profit
on your milk.
Plant Carrots. No crop gives a bet
ter yield. Nothing is better for milk
cow feed.
Make your plans to put up enough
feed for next winter. Now is the time
to lay the ground work. Every time
you go to town forjeed you lose time
and money.
Almost anything that grows out of
the ground will make ensilage. En
silage is to the cow in winter what a
mess of greens is to the man.
If you have not already an alfalfa
meadow plan to have one. The best
and cheapest cow feed, because you
get more than one crop every year.
S. A. Murray, who was formerly in
the dry goods business here and burned

800 FREIGHT CARS
PASS HERE EACH DAY
One Cement Plant Loads 60 Cars Every
Day —Greatest Movement of
Freight Ever Known
In talking with Terminal Agent
Woodrow one day this week we learned
that on one day of twenty-four hours
recently one thousand freight cars past
thru Leavenworth, and that the present
movement averages eight hundred cars
every twenty-four hours. One cement
making plant at Concrete, Skagit coun
ty, has an order with the railroad
company for sixty freight cars every
day. Present indications are that the
volume of freight will increase rather
than diminish for some time to come.
Of course war material forms a large
part of the westbound traffic at this
time, but as there is no indication of
the war coming to an end soon this
will keep up indefinitely. There are
some hundreds of lumber mills scat
tered thruout the state that have not
begun to cut lumber. When all the
sawmills and wood-working establish
ments of Washington get under full
headway they will add from two hun
dred to two hundred and fifty cars to
the daily traffic.
With all this going on who can doubt
that Washington will once more throb
and thrive with industry this summer,
and that prosperity will reach into every
town and hamlet.
