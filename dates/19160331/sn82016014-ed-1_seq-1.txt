None of the American wound-

Ueneral I ershlllg said that
what was regarded as conf irma
; tion of the report that he was
suffering from a broken leg had
been received. His exact where-
abouts had not been learned.
Colonel Dodd led his Seventh
and Tenth cavalry in a smash
ing ride from the north toward
Guerrero when he learned of the
presence there of the Villa force,
covering the 55 miles interven
ing in seventeen hours. General
Pershing said he arrived there
at 6 o'clock, going into action
immediately, but whether it was
6 o'clock in the morning or aft
ernoon the report did not indi
cate. Capture Machine Guns.
It was a complete surprise- to the
Villa force, whic hhad entered into a
celebration ol its victory over the par
rteon the day before.
Soon after the action began the
Mexicans were breaking for cover and
beginning to disappear along the trails
that lead to the mountains northeast
of the r airway. For ten miles the
running fight that began at Guerrero
was continued and abandoned only
when the division of the retreating
force into numerous small bodies
made pursuit impossible.
Colonel Dodd reported that he had
captured two machine guns and a
considerable number of saddles and
rifles. The fleeing bandits left behind
several Carranza soldiers, who said
they had been held by Villa for exe
cution. They were released.
May Make New Stand.
General Pershing said that it was
not improbable that Villa would en
deavor to reassemble his forces some
where along the head waters of the
Santa Maria river.
He moving his forces in such
manner as to prevent if possible new
concentration or to re-engage any
force that does make a stand.
He regarded as probable the elimi
nation from active development of
Villa for some time on account of his
injured leg.
The fighting lasted five hours and
although General Perching" s report
fails to state whether it began in the
morning or late in the afternoon, staff
officers in General Funston's head
quarters assumed that it was an early
m i ruing attack.
General Pershing reported that a
part of Villa's losses was that of a
number of horses. He expressed the
Opinion that the blow 'olonel Dodd
had inflicted was serious and would
go far towards finishing the work of

FIGHT IN COURT OVER ROY
Xorman J. Prescott and Wife
Would Have CUM Custody.
Witnesses Tell of Auto Rides
With Other Than Husband.
All day today ten-year-old George
Prescott, bright and handsome, has
sat on a bench in the corridor outside
of Judge A. W. Dana's court room,
while judge, lawyers and witnesses
have been determining whether he
sh& 11 be a half orphan, and if so
whether he shall spend the rest of his
youthful years with his father or
mother.
The case on trial is the divorce ac
tion brought by Lida Prescott against
her husband, Norman J. Prescott.
The case was filed last August follow
ing medical treatment for Mrs. Pres
cott which she maintains was made
necessary when her husband threw
her down a flight of stairs. While the
husband filded an answer in the case
his answer is not in the nature of a
cross-petition. The hearing today has
assumed the nature of a fight over the
ten-year-old boy.
The defense has attempted to show
that Mrs. Prescott is not a proper wo
man to hae the custody of her own
child. Efforts have been made
through witnesses to show that Mrs.
Prescott took frequent automobile
rides with men other than her hus
band. The prosecution is attempting
to show that Mrs. Prescott is justified
in seeking a divorce and that she is
competent and qualified morally to
care ror the boy.
Fifteen or more witnesses have been
subpoenaed and the indications are
that the case is going to take up con
siderable time in tae first division of
the district court. Neighbors and
friends of the family filled the court
room.

Thirty persons were killed and scores were injured in the Lake Shore train wreck at Amherst, ohic early
Wednesday morning. These pictores, showing the effects of tne disaster, were taken Wednesday afternoon,
before any of the debris had been cleared away.
The wreck was one of those rarest of railroad calamities not one collision, but two. involving three trains,
on two tracks. When the half dozen investigations now under way arc concluded, tlie blame will be fixed on
some luckless railroad employee. A block signal, set suddenly and without warning, against a train speeding

to the real cause of the wreck.

Several battalions were wiped out in
the capture of Malancourt. French
guns on Hill 304 cut such great gaps
in the charging lines of German that
the attack was halted, after the Ger
mans had secured a foothold in the
village, through lack of men to follow
up the drive.

BANDITS SLAY 3
Villa Said To Be in Raid ear
Minuaca, Chihuahua.
172 Reported Massacred in
Same Locality Last Night-
El Paso, March 31. A man named
Herman Blankenburg and two others
were murdered yesterday at Minnaca,
Chihuahua, by Francisco Villa and his
follower according to private but
authentic sources here. Details of the
killing are lacking.
Minnaca is situated on the Kansas
City, Mexico & Orient railraod, which
joins with the Mexico Northwestern at
La Junta, and is about ten miles
southeast of Guerrero, where Villa is
reported to haye massacred 172 Car
ranza supporters. Today this in
formation substantiates, therefore,
previous statements of the bandit's
whereabouts and indicates there is
truth in the reports that tu has turned
eastward and may come in contact
with American cavalry along the Mex
ico Northwestern.
Information Considered Authentic.
Although Blankenburg's name indi
cates he is of German descent, the
meager information available here is
that he is an American citizen. It is
believed the other victims of Villa's
wrath also were Americans, as the
bandit's vengeance hardly would be
t anted against persons of any other
nationality. The information regard
ing the reported assassination was
telephoned from Minnaca to Chihua
hua last night over a private line by
an employee of an American concern,
and telegraphed from Chihuahua to
EI Paso.
The names of other A mericans
known to have been in or near Min
naca are Ackling, Hemple Locke and I

Lewes. Del.. March 31. Ems
Schiller, the young German who cap
tured the British steamer Matopp
and terrorized her crew of T6 men oil
Wednesday night shortly after the
ship had sailed out of New York h.tr
bor for Vladivostok with railroad
i supplies for Russia declared today
that he was a spy for the German
government Weary' from the exctt
ment he had undergone he threw him
self upon a cot In the Lewes jail early
today and sought sleep. Previously
I he had emphatically denied that he
was a German spy, declaring his ob
ject was to seize the ship's treasure.
"Yes, I am a spy for the German
! government." he said. "You can be
i lieve it or not it makes no difference
! to me. 1 got my instructions from the
I German government to go aboard tha
I ship and blow her up and to prevent
j her cargo from reaching Russia.
"I could have blown her up but
the captain's plea for his wife and
' daughter was too much for me and I
i had not the heart to do it. I am ready
to take the consequences, but 1 ask
that they keep me ashore instead of
sending me back to the ship for the
captain to take me in charge."
Who Has Jurisdiction.
Schiller had been told thai as his
daring exploit occurred outside the
three-mile limit he would in all likeli
hood be taken to British possessions In
the West Indies for trial for piracy.
I Federal authorities and represent a-
tives from the British government
came today to examine Schiller and
decide what to do with him. If the
United States finds it has no juris
diction under international maritime
law, he will be turned over to the
representatives of Great Britain. An
! examination into Schiller's mental
condition will be made. Those who
have talked with him believe he is
irresponsible and that his story of his
career is not true.
Schiller was reluctant to tell his his
tory. "I was born in Germany," he said.
"Never mind the town of my parents
name. I have been in this country
one year; in New York three weeks.
I was sent by the German government
to England soon after the war started
and at Germany's request. 1 enlisted
in the British navy and was assigned
to the training ship Conway at Liver-
I pool.
Many Spies in British Navy.
"I want to say right now that there
are several thousand Germans in th
British navy, I know what this means
to me. It's the Tower of London if
they get me back to the Matoppo. But
1 won't go, just bear that in mind."
Captain Rlchu rd Bergner of ( h
Matoppo said he is convinced rhattL.
Schiller is a former naval officer.
: Talking of his exoerienc.es he said-
Matoppo, declares he believes the man
is mentally irresponsible. Captain
Bergner says he is "far from h'ung
simple minded"
"This fellow may act the fool now,"
Bergner said, "but he is far from b
ing simple minded. n you will see by
what happened. We left New York.

the Sandy Hook at 8 o'clock when I
