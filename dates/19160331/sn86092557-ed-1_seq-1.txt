this might be carried out according to
the wishes of the voters in those coun-1
ties and with a vote of thanks to the

A feature of the strength of Judge

Sentiment developed during the day
also urging the Hon. Joseph H. Mc
Dermott of Morgantown to announce
as a candidate for Congress for the
short terra in the second district.' Mc
Dermott was non-committal but he
may become the harmony candidate!
for the special election, as he is look- !

confidence of the party. Everywhere
and>on every tongue there is' only one
word as a prediction for the general

is "Victory."' Fr< ni every section of
the state i learn that the Republicans!
are only waiting the results of the pri-1
xnaries to buckle down to work for a
Republican majority for every man oni
the-party ballot.
Republicans point out that if the
Democrats had any real hope of car-)
rying the State ticket, long ere this
there would have been something of a
rush to fill the ticket for Auditor,
Treasurer, Secretary of State, Attor
ney General, Superintendent of School,
for which offices, as well as for Con
gress in the First and Third Districts
thero are no announced candidates as
yet before the Democratic voters, as

PLACE IS III
When It Arrives Fairmont
Will Be a Well Lighted
Town.
"I've had one of the now luminous
arcs placed In front of my house and
I want to thank the city'very much
for It."
This Is heard hourly on the phones
entering the city building hut it Is not
all that Is said, for immediately fol
lowing the wee voice says, "But It's
never been lighted yet"
Lamps that have been hung for the
past month In different sections of
the city are merely to be gazed upon
during the day and perhaps cussed dur
ing the night tor not lighting up the
way through the mud.
The reason for this Is that a new
switch board .which has been ordered
by the Monongahela Valley Traction
company people has been on the road
for 30 days and hasn't arrivell at the
company's plant thus far.
When this switch board arrives
there will be lighted during the night
in Fairmont over 300 lights Instead of
less than 200 as at present. Most all
poles, aond lamps have been put up
except along the Great White Way.
City Engineer, Shrewsbury Miller is
laying out the spots on which the
lights are to be placed on Main street
regardless of the fact that a few of.the
property'.owners along that street
haye failed to come across with any
encouraging promises concerning pay
ing for the frontage.
. The Oreat White Way lights and the
eixtra lights, the ones'.which are to be
placed in certain sections where'need
ded after the 300 are placed, are the
only ones which have not been hung.
