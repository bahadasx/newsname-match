An Associated Press dispatch
from Washington, D. C. under
date of March 28, says:
"A full investigation of tliu
circumstances of the raid on
Columbus, N. M ., by Villa mid
his bandits has been ordered by
the war department. General
Funston has been directed to
take the matter up as soon as
Colonel Slocutn, commanding
the Thirteenth Cavalry, and such
of Ids men as took part in re
pulsing the bandit, return from
Mexico.
"So far the department has
no official report of what took
place except foi brief telegraphic
dispatches. Tho officers and
men of the Thirteenth Cavalry
have been too busy with the
pursuit of Villa lor tippoarance
before a court of inquiry. The
orders to General Funston be
came known tonight when ab
stracts of Secretary Baiter's
testimony before the house
appropriations committee in
connection with the emergency
$8,000,000 became available."
Honor To Whom Honor is Due
Several times recently the re-
murk has been made: "What u
pity that the old lilth Cavalry,
ufter enduring the hardships
incident to life on the bordci for
so long a time should at last be
disgraced."
The lilth Cavalry is not dis
graced! Whatever criticism
may be mudo of the commanding
officer, should not ami does not
extend to the men. They fought
nobly indeed.
Possibly it is not generally
known that on the morning of
the attack they numbered .ess
than 100 armed men.
Certainly to their cou-uge
and valor many of us owe our
lives. All honor to the men of
the Thirteenth Cavalry. One of
the greatful.
The government have put on a
lMlico fore! in Columbus and
around camp composed of twenty-live
citizens. Eight of these
men arc on duty at a time and do
eight hour shifts. This guard,
in addition to the regular mili
tary guard makes it impossible
for any force to enter town
without the alarm being given.
Work On Well Continues
The drilling of the deep well
by It. W. Ehlott on his ranch six
miles from town is being con
tinued. The 4U0 foot love) lias
been readied. The last thirty
or fourty feet lias been drilled
through a hard rock, and the
work has been slow. It is ex
pected that the artesian water
bearing strata which was struck
in the Dean well, will bo en
countered within the next liun
dred feet.

Is r.aklng arrangements to put

Miss Freda Rogers, of Dein
ing, who had been lending her
assistance to tlio Columbus
Telepliono Co. since the big
show, returned home Tuesday.
Colonel Slocum, who was in
command at Columbus, Now
Mexico, at the time of the Villa
mid, hud been notified number
less times that Villa was en route
to Columbus and the citv was
liable to un attack at any time.
In fact, the very day Villa enter
ed Columbus, Slocum was
warned that the Mexican bund-
its were within six miles of
Sln:um's headquarters, but he
ridiculed the warning and did
not even ascertain by investigu-
us to tlio truth of the roport. He
had six troops of American
soldiers under his command and
patroled a six mile border line
wi ll two guards. Villa, of course
wps cognizant of Slocum's ac-
tinns and watched his opportun
ity and marched in between the
guards, robbed tlio town and
'filled six soldiers and eighteen
citizens. Villa personally kicked
the doors of the officers down
and siiot into their quarters, und
after doing all tlio misshtef he
dosired, he captured sixty-four
of Slocums horses and escaped.
What an infamous record for an
American soldier, to fucc, the
fellow is a disgrace to his coun
try and ought to bo court- mar

Phoenix Arizona.
J. It. Blair spent a fow days in

State Chairman Italph C. Ely
has announced hU candidacy for
the Republican nomination for
governor.
If wo were the Republican
party he's the kind of a candi
date wo would bo looking for.
But we fear Mr. Ely will not get
far. His ideas and Ideals are
diametrically opposed to those
of the General Managers. He
is opposed to the raco issue,
isn't owned by the corporations,
wants bettor schools and farms
and homes, and believe in the
kind of politics that puts the
cards on tho table.
We hope Mr. Ely will stick to
his ideas and ideals, no matter
what the steamroller may do to
him this year. His kind of Re
publican iwlltlcs is the kind that
will eventually win. Wo believe
ho is looking just a little further
ahead than some of the party
leaders who smile cynically at
ills aspirations.
A good strong fight for his
kind of politics in the party this
year will at least shako the dust
out of the broom for the final
Inevitable houso cleaning, and
have a most wholesome effect on
the situation. New Mexican.
