Cream of tartar, derived from grapes,
is used in Royal Baking Powder because
it is' the best and most healthful ingredient
known for the purpose.
Phosphate and alum, which are de
rived from mineral sources, are .used in
some baking powders, instead of cream: of
tartar, because they are cheaper.
If you have boon induced tq us. baking;

liquid which will start your liver
iust as surely as calomel, but It
doesn't make you sick and can

Children and grown folks can
take Dodson's Liver Tone, be
cause it is perfectly harmless.
