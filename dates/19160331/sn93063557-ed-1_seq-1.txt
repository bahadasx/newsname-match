ADDISON COUNTY FARMERS.
The County Apent has the followinp
to say in rt-Rard to obtnininR Pure
Culture from the Government for the
purposeof inoculatinR legumes such as
alfalfa, dover, soybeans, fudd benns,
etc. The following was taken from a
communication sent to him hy the
Iiureau of Plnnt Industry whlch fur
nishes this material:
"For several years the United States
Department of Agriculture has culti
vated and distributed Liquid Pure
Culture of . Bacteria beneficial to
leguminoua plnnts and the large per
centage of successful experiments now
recorded warrants the continuation of
this free distribution. Only a limited
quantity, however, will be sent to any
one farmer. With an acre field
thoroughly inoculated in this way, an
abundant supply of field soil is available
for the inoculation of a more extensive
acreage the following season.
"Field Soil Inoculation. When a
field is known to be well inoculated for a
certain legume crop, for example,
alfalfa, as indicated by numerous
nodules upon the roots of the alfalfa
plants growing thereon, such soil is
very desirable lor tho inoculation of
other fields on the same farm or on
farms nearby, upon whieh alfalfa is to
be sown for the first time. Such soil,
well sifted, can be readilj applied to the
new field through a fertilizer attachment
on a drill. One hundred pounds of sifted
soil will be sufiicient for an acre thus
applied. Broadcasting the soil by hand
will require a larger quantity and is
best done in the enrly moming, late
evening or on cloudy days, as the sun's
rays are injurious to the thin layer of
inoculated soil thus exposedlto it. The
field should be immediately hnrrowed
after broadcasting the soil. Trans
ferring field soil from nuy considerabln
distance is expensive and subject to the
dangerof introducing insects, weeds
and plnnt diseases."
