PROGRESS OP THE WAR.
The Germans are still pounding away
at Verdun, but apparently not so con
tinuously as at first. They still make
infantry assaults and make some gains
on which both sides are losers. The
fight has now lasted forty days.
Submarine warfare is being continued
briskly and many ship9 have been sunk
some as claimed by survivors, without
warning. An English cross channel
steamer, the "Sussex" carrying some 400
passengers was a victim a few days ago
of whom about 100 were drowned some
being Americans. This of course brings
the submarine question to the surface
again. Norwegian, Swedish and Hol
land ships are sunk in almost equal
numbers to those of the English.
The Russains seem to be making
strong efforts with some success to drive
the Germans back out of Russia. Heavy
fighting is reported el! along from th»
Riga region 5oO miles southward.

THE NO-PARTY MEETING
On Thursday of last week there was a
meeting at the city hall called by the
Non-Partisan LeHgue and addressed by
Mr, Williams, fca^worker who has been
operating in this county during the fall
and winder months. The Pioneer Ex
press was invited to send a reporter and
ibis writer attended the meeting in that
ca pacity.
There were about seventy-five persons
present mostly farmers, as business men
and citizens, were not present in large
numbers.
Mr. Williams is^a good specimen otthe
average stump speaker. He has a'good
voice and knows how to speak his peice.
As to the substance of his remarks "it
was just what people like, who like that
sort of thins
We have not the time or space of
course to give the address of an hour or
more in these columns. We will how
ever, try to give the doctrines and plat
form and plans of this non party in brief
as we caught them from the speaker.
They are about as follows:—
That for forty years.the legislature has
been in the hands of the "other fellows."
That all legislation has been manipu
lated for these "other fellows" and with
out regard to the peculiar interests of
the farmers.
That farmers have and should there
fore form a non-political body and see
that* only farmers are elected as state
and legislative officials.
That in time this organization would
include all farmers in the United States
who would then govern the whole Uuit
ed States.
That the immediate and pressing needs
of the farmers in this state were termin
al elevators, compulsory hail insurance,
rural credit banking system, single land
tax, packing house and stock yards.
Incidentally, to the terminal elevator,
that farmers should grade their own
wheat fix the price and also receive fair
pay for "dirt" mixed with giain. That
the system of rural credits should be
based on government credit bonds at
two or three per cent on grain stored in
public state warehouses and said grain
to be held until the prices are satisfac
tory to the farmers. ^sSSlKSHHl
Financially, the speaker said that for
every six or nine dollars that the mem
bers pay to the organization they would
receive hundreds and t-hou&nds of doU
Iars in return through the proposed
legislative enactments.
That the trade

(Speaking of the extent and financing
of the ofg&nization the speaker, detailed
the Work of a very large office force at
Faygo and a 70,000 dollar newspaper
plant that published a paper four times
bigger than any other paper in the state.
That there were ninety-three ^automo
biles now in store ready to start out as
soon as the weather opens up foV a sum
mer campaign and that it would take
9800 in postage to send one letter to each
member.
Later—Vesterday'stelegrams sald that thst the farmers would know with whom
*enr tkMfs were using the fllilroads to]to deal,—and that termers should «nd

From these and similar Statements the
speaker deduced the fact that the farm
era for the first time in history had the
"steam roller" going ttbder their control
and that they proposed to crush all op
(ttsition as flat as pancakes.
Some general remarks were to the
effect, "We want legislation so that
farmers ttk'h make some money as well
as the 'other fellows," "Lawyere 'Write
the taws and thtn we have to hire
lawyers to tell us what the 'laWs mean,"
farmers can write
fawB
in 'plain Eng
lish that will need no explanation,
'Politicians appeal to prejudices."
The rales of the organization bar all
but aetual farmers from regular mem
bership. "Business men" may however
pay the required fee and join as honor
ary" members, bilt have no vote. The
speaker advised business men to procure
Isuoh certificates «nd past tbem up so

The methods controlling state and
county elections in brief, is for the mem
bers of the non-partisan league to parti
cipate in the primaries as democrats and
republicans as usual.
They will also see that the non-partisan
candidates previously selected are plac
ed on the regular party tippets under the
democratic and HS'pu'blicftn headings as
usual. Then the democratic non-parti
sans will vote solidly for their candid
ates and the non-pafiisan republicans
will vote accordingly on their bailots,
thus insuring the non-partisan names to
be printed on the regular election bal
lots in November, when the non parti
sans will vote for their particular selec
tions without reference to party. Such
a legislative ticket consisting o! t$0 for
mer republicans and two fotftier demo
crats has already been nominated in this
county, each pair of these are expected
to be nominated %t the June primaries
by the respective parties as republicans
and democrats, but all four are to get
the full vote tf the non-partisans at the
Novembet "election The choice for state
officers Will be made at Fargo at the
convention to held at Fargo on the 31st,
with a representation of one delegate
ftom each legislative district in the state.
As to county officers there is nothing
said openly as yet, but it is probable
that the "steam roller1' methods will be
applied to them as well as to business
men and others.
The above condensed statment of the
plsns and purposes of this new etgani
zation in itself takes about all the space
that can.be spared at this time. We hsve
written it lor the puiyoeo of information
rather than for critioism. We 'have not
intended to misrepresent in anyway.
The statements are themselves their
own criticisms. They area oombination
of pure ^socialises, and the ideas of the

the foundation planks of socailism, while
special legislation and government ware
houses were shibboleths of the populist
and alliance parties. But there lafctor
never got so far as to publicly proclaim
the boycott as a legitimate political
weapon.
This country may be at war with Mexi
co or Germany within a few days, but
nobody seems to be worrying over it. It
is one of the strange phases ot the times
and perhaps because we have heard so
much about war that we have become
hardened to the idea.
Tbd railroad unions submitted their
demands for an eight hour day with
time and a half for overtime, to the rail
way authorities yesterday and expect an
answer by April 29th. The results of
this conference may be of vast import
ance to the whoM United States as about
all the train crews on all roads west of
Chicago are likely to strike if the de
mands are not granted.]

NO-PARTISAMS
The plarl of the No part people, by
which they expect to divide the offices
between the republicans and democrats
ought to be satisfactory to the democrats
and perhaps explains the action of some
local democratic leaders. Normally, the
state and county are republican, hence
the democrats could naturally expect no
offices, but if the No party movement can
get enough republican votes, then the
democratic-non-partisan candidates are
sure to be elected.
It is the pie-counter which will wreck
the Non-partisan party. Pastry isn't
good for the health of political parties.
When so many democrats and so many
republicans meet at Fargo to-morrow at
the No-party convention and attempt to
nominate a state ticket, the cleavagti of
the two real parties will be certain to
show up. Probably the democrats will
be willing to permit the republicans to
name the candidate for governor, pro
vided the republicans will endorse John
Burke for senator. The Nonparty people
are in the position of the man who is
standing on the backs of two horses, but
each horse going in different directions.
The elephant and the donkey won't make
a good farm team even when driven by a
political farmer.
The position of the "auxilliary" mem
bers of the No party is rather pitiable.
They psy their nine dollars entrance
fee, but are only allowed to watoh the
"farmers" eat, while they themselves sit
on the door step—along with the farmers'
doga. The "auxilliaries" can hold no
office and have no vote.
The nine dollar fee is a shrewd move
of the leaders. Not only does is provide
the sinews of war—and pooket money

it will cause the members to "Stick,
stiok, stick," until they are finally oon*
