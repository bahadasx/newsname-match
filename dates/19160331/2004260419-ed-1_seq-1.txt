With a whirl, nourish and flurry
tho St. Helens Mist big piano con lent
closed Wednesduy afternoon at 3
o'clock sharp, resulting In tho award
of tho beautiful Ohornieyer & Soim
piano to Miss Nooina Chlttlm, she
having hud 182,775 votes to her
credit in the flnul totaling.
Mins Murle Dixon, howevor, gave
her a close race and totalled up
151,275 votes.
The contest has resulted aiso In
Increasing tho subscription list by
several hundred new readers whom
we are sure will bo pleased with Its
contents, as the Mist has at all
times tried to get all the news pos
sible in and around St. Helens.
There are nine prizes to be dis
tributed, so there will bo prizes for
eight other contestants. Wo wish to
thank the merchants for their co
operation In this great business gett
ing campaign, as well as all tho con
testants who worked so diligently to
win.
We are sorry that the piano had
not arrived by tho time of the clos
ing, but this Is not the fault of the
Publisher's Music Co. nor ourselves
as the Instrument was shipped on
February 23, so It is evident that It
Is tied up on the rood. A tracer has
been sent after it and It will prob
ably be here In a few days.
The final count was made and ap
proved by Glen U. Motsker, H. O.
Strom and K. Nordin.

thoso weighing less thun 25 pounds

pounds or over. Thoso are the prices
which the Columbia river packers
havo fixed for raw Chinook salmon
during the season which opens on
May 1. Tho prlco of steelheuds was
set at throo cents a pound. These
figures are ono-half cent a pound less
for the small fish than tho rate set
by tho fishermen's union. Tho price
for tho large salmon and tho divid
ing point between tho two classes of
fish are the sumo as wero announced
by the union several days ago.

TOO MANY WIVES
FOR ONE MAN
VlrKll Jones In Juil Charged With
lilKumy
Sheriff Stunwood went over the
hills through irud and snow Friday
to Mist, where he arrested Mrs. Kay
Hill on a warrant from Multnomah
county charging her with arson. He
took her to Portland and surrender
ed her to 8herlff Hurlburt.
He then went on to Salem and re
turned with one, Virgil Jones, who Is
charged with bigamy. It Is claimed
that he left his family in company
with a woman who is also married.
Sheriff Stanwood located them at
Rainier and the Bliorlff of Marlon
county came and arrested them on a
warrant charging them with adultery.
When It was learned that a war
rant had been Issued from Columbia
county on the more Berlous charge of
bigamy, Jones was surrendered to
Sheriff Stanwood, who brought him
here and is now in Jail to await the
action of the grand Jury which will
not meet until May 9th.
Later Jones had a preliminary
trial before Justice Philip Wednes
day and on recommendation of the
district attorney, the case was dis
missed for the reason that there did
not appear to be sufficient evidence
to warrant holding defendant.
FOR A FIRE TRUCK
At the city election April 3, it will
be left to the people of St. Helens,
whether or not we will purchase a
lire truck at a cost not to exceed
$1500.00.
I am, of course, In favor of the
buying of a truck for several reasons.
That It will be more economical a
fire, as we are now equipped it costs
the city at least $7.50 for drawing
carts , and the carts are shook up In
such shape that they then require re
pairs. A truck making a trip to a fire
would not cost to exceed $1.00. We
always have several trips to grass
fires during the hot or dry part of the
summer. Last summer as many as
three different calls were put In In
one day, and the firemen go out and
ruin their clothes, where, tf they had
an auto truck they could have their
oil coats on it and save their clothes.
The truck, as I understand, will
cost about $1275, and we have hose
enough to fit it up In fine shape, but
if wo still keep the "hand" carts, it
will cost around $900 to equip them
and then we have got nothing more
than we hud before.
The auto truck will lower the In
surance rates more than it would In
crease the tuxes, by about 5 to 1.
It will be put up to you, Mr. Prop
erty Owner, to decide whether or not
the city will purchase an auto fire
truck or wo draw the old hand carts.
Respectfully,
L. E. ALLEN,
Chief of Fire Dept.
CLUB ENTERTAINED
Walden Dlllard entertained the
Pacific University Glee Club at a re
ception and supper after the concert,
at his home, on Thursday, March 23.
The three long tables In the din
ing room, which had for centerpieces
beds of growing violets, were presid
ed over by Mr. and Mrs. Dlllard, Mr.
and Mrs. Joseph McCoy and Walden
Dlllard and Dorothy John. Other St.
Helens guests were C. E. Ostrander,
Harlan Turner, Harry Richardson
and Mason Dlllard. Mr. Ostrander
mado a very entertaining toastmaster
and Miss Maude English, Mr. Live
say, J. H. McCoy, Harlan Turner and
Mr. Dlllard responded most fiitttngly
to toasts.
LINE IN GOOD SHAPE
On the twonty-thtrd of the month
the St. Helens Telephone Company
cut In the last phone which was put
out of commission by the silver thaw
on February 8th. Dr. Zipperer states
that most of his city lines " were
down, In fact only 20 phones were
working. In addition to this most
of his Warren and Scappooso lines
were down. The rapidity of the re
establishmont of tho service Is much
appreciated by the patrons of the
company. Moro thun 300 phones are
now In service.
AVALANCHE OF MuWST. HELENS IN COURT
SLIDE BLOCKS TRAFFIC
Truin and Automobile Traffic are
Held l p
A rush of mud and earth occasion
ed by the recent heavy rains, came
from the hills Sunday morning Just
at Holbrook, blocking the highway
with from four to six feet of mud
and sliding down on the S. P. & S.
R. R. tracks one hundred feet below.
All auto and other traffic on the
highway was held up until Thursday
night, when the Multnomah road of
ficials had It cleared away. The
trains were compelled to transfer
passengers and freight at this point
until Tuesday night, when the large
steam shovel they had working
cleared away the mud so that now
trains are running on schedule time.
GLEE CLUB CONCERT
The Pacific University Glee Club
was greeted with a good audience at
the city hall Thursday evening, and
they got the worth of their money.
The club was composed of as fine
a bunch of young ladles as can be
found anywhere.
For some reason or other, the cur
tain was slow In raising, and there
was considerable delay between num
bers, but the evening's entertainment
was a success nevertheless.
Wo do not all Bee alike and It
would be difficult to deteimlne the
most popular numbsr. From our
standpoint, the violin solo by Miss
Catharine Davis has first place with
Miss Beth Crandall in "Aloha" a
good second.
The rendition of Dan McGrew by
Herbert Butler Dcuell, was faultless
ly rendered and met with hearty ap
plause. He responded to an encore
that was also well received.
The solo by Mrs. Frank Thomas
Chapman should also be mentioned
among the best, but It would not be
Just to give her first place over the
young people, as she Is a member of
the faculty and an Instructor in voice
culture.
The male quartet was heartily ap
plauded and kindly responded to an
encore. For some reason they were
not at their best, at least they were
not up to expectations.
PINK LUNCHEON
Mrs. J. L. Zipperer entertained
last Thursday at her home with a
pink luncheon in honor ot the young
ladles of the Pacific University Glee
Club. Mrs. M. E. Miller assisted.
The table was beautiful with a cen
terpiece of pink sweet peas and ferns.
Individual pink nut baskets marked
the guests' places. The guests be
sides the hostess were Misses Mary
Westaway, Edith Thorloy, Wllma
Young, Dorothy Brent, Beth Cran
dall, Alvena Howard, Alice Smith,
Helen Bartlett, Maude English, Elida
Lynes, Margaret Keep, Helen Brun
ner, Zola Klrry, Emma Craft, Cath
erine Davis, Mary Anna Brobst and
Mrs. M. E. Miller.
