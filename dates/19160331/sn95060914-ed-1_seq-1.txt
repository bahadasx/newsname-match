Why do motor oils made from

carbon deposits asked B F
Golding of the Standard Oil
Company repeating the question
put to him by a Graham Guar- i
dian representative yesterday
Well its a rather technical
subject for the ordinary citizen
said Mr Golding but as our I
friends the chemists would say
oil made from asphalt base crude
vaporizes and distills without
decomposition j

Summer
This year the teachers chose
as a subject for study Ameri
can Literature The entire
corps have taken part in this
work two teachers being pre
pared with a paper at each meet
ing After the papers have been
read the subject is opened for
discussion and some very inter
esting and helpful points have
been brought out
The teachers have taken up
this study that they may not only
improve themselves but also that
they may make themselves more
efficient in the schools by the
better application of their know-
ledge
The next regular meeting will I
be held Friday evening April
21st at the home of Mrs Mc
1 Alister at which time the sub
ject for next years study hour
will be voted upon It is likely
that the subject for next year
will be along some professional
line such as pedagogy psychology i
or child study because the teach
ers feel that work of this kind
j on their part will probably be of
more value to the school 1
The members of the board of
education are always present at
these meetings which is greatly
appreciated by the teachers and
which materially strengthens the
organization of our schools The
l first part of each meeting is given
over entirely to business manage
valves and catch and hold carbon
derived from the motor fuel
Oil derived from asphalt base
crude maintains its correct lubri
cating body until its work is com
pleted and then passes off with
the exhaust leaving a clean cyl
inder
It simply amounts to this
nature has given asphalt base
crude a different and more ad
vantageous chemical construc
tion as far as producing good
motor oils is concerned And
when this oil is correctly refined
naturally it gives the motorist
better results
Preparedness Is
Becoming Popular
The citizens of the United
States outside of military organi
zations are evidently taking the
talk of preparedness seriously as
reports are being received from
every section of the country
showing the formation of rifle
clubs organized for the purpose Juarez
of training citizens as marksmen
This shows that the spirit of
the American pioneers is still in
the breast of all Americans and
if given sufficient time the Amer
ican nation as a nation will soon
be recoganized as a shooting na
tion as it was in the days prior
i to the Civil War
Pima and Thatcher
It is hoped to form a State or
ganization of these clubs and that
a State trophy will be arranged
for competition by representa
tives from the military company
and it is believed that the best
shots in the State can be de
veloped here
