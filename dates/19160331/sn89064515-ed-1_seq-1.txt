VOL. 28 NO. 4 LITTLE FALLS, MORRISON COUNTY, MINNESOTA
FARMERS OF THIS VICINITY OR
GANIZED ASSOCIATION
HERE
At a meeting of about seventy-five
farmers at the court house Saturday
atternoon the organization of a-farm
ers' cooperative* creamery association
was effected! and preliminary steps
were taken for the establishing of a
creamery in Little Falls. No decision
has yet been made in regard to the
plant but the association will probably
build one. Carl Peterson of Green
Prairie was elected temporary chair
man of the organization and J. W.
Hanson of Green Prairie secretary.
A committee of four which had been
canvassing the surrounding farming
country to ascertain how many cows
are available reported that cream can
be secured from at least 1,040 cows.
It is planned to sell the shares of the
organization at $25, the members to
be limited to four shares apiece. One
need not be a stockholder to bring
cream to the creamery, however.
Saturday, April 8, another meeting
will be held, when organization will be
perfected and officers elected for the
ensuing year.
TALK OF GUN CLUB ON WEST
SIDE
There is some talk among the West
side sportsmen :oj£ organizing a gun
club on that side^ftf1 the riv« and4 the
plan will likely materialize unless some
arrangements can be made whereby the
traps of the city gun club aw more
centrally located. It is possible that
the club may move to the grounds
west of the Antlers hotel bv.ilding and
in such event no club would be formed'
on the West side. However, with two
clubs in the city, it would result in
competitive shoots and woiild create
a good natured rivalry in this sport.

WITH SHADE TREES, ALONG THE
NORTH SIDE OF BROADWAY
ON WEST SIDE
At a joint meeting of the Civic
league and the literary section of the
Musical Art club at the library par
lors Monday evening various matters
in regard to the beautifying of our
city, etc., were discussed and steps
taken to have the plans carried out,
as far as possible. The attendance at
the meeting was not very large but
all were enthusiatic and anxious to
do something.
Miss Emma Lally, visiting nurse,
who has been/here for some time, un
der the supervision of the Civic league,
made a report on what she had done
thus far. Out of 305 children sent to
her for examination only fifteen were
found to be in a perfect condition.
All the rest were in need of various
kinds of treatment, she stated. Fifty
hemes have been visited and the mem
bers of the families in these homes ex
amined. Twenty defective children
will be sent to the different state in
stitutions. One woman was taken to
the university hospital in Minneapolis
the first of the week for treatment.
The matter of establishing public
playgrounds was discussed. Tne board
of education will have playground ap
paratus installed on .the, playgrounds
at the various schools in' the cifp' in the
near future and therefore it is not
likely that any other public play
grounds will be established. The
question of engaging a playgrounds
supervisor was also discussed but no
action taken.
It was decided to ask Mayor Fortier
to designate a cleanup week and to
ask the council to furnish a man and
team to gather garbage in the city
during the summer months. A resolu
tino was also passed' asking the mayor
to have the curfew rung regularly and
urging him not to grant any licenses
to carnival companies to exhibit here.
The park committee of the Civic
league was asked to work with the
park committee of the city council in
an effort to have the north side of
Broadway on the West side, from Sec
ond street to the patk, boulevarded,
and trees planted. They were also
asked to see that the driveways in the
park are properly maintained during
the coming summer and that the neces
sary signs, etc., be put up. It is plan
ed to have a policeman and caretaker
at the park throughout the summer.
Miss Maude Smalley gave a short
talk on musical work and what has
been done along that line in this city.
She mentioned' especially the commun
ity idea, of songfests in which all
take part. She also urged the, intro
etion of musig ~i«

SOCIETY
WANT BOULEVARD TO PARK BLOW WUKIH $5,000 AND EN 2 COUNCILS MEET NEXT WEEK
SUCH IS PENALTY AHHBBOTrn
AGAINST TRUMAN LAMFHERE
FOR BREAKING GIESE'S JAW
Long Prairie Leader (23): Five
thousand dollars and a term in the
state reformatory constitute the price
to be paid/ by Truman Lamphere for a
wallop on the jaw. The wallop was
delivered—not received. Judgment en
try in this amount was made by Judge
J. A. Boeser in district court during
the past week and reported to County
Attorney Wood.
The amount is awarded to Frank
Giese, who was on the receiving end
of the wallop. Mr. Giese sustained a
fracture of the jaw as a suit of the
impact which took place in a saloon
at Swanville.
The verdict for the plaintiff comes
after Lamphere had been sentenced on
a criminal charge in Morrison county
to a term in the state reformatory at
St. Cloud. Lamphere is now doing
time.
The dtetails of this historic case are
pretty well known among residents of
this section of the state. Giese was
in a saloon in Swanville during the
past summer when a newsboy came
into the bar and asked him to 'buy a
paper.
Giese did not deign to notice the
newsie and being "thus 'feiltentlv re
buked the youth pushed his papers at
his prospect. For this "display of
juvenile disrespect. Giese struck the
papers, knocking them from the boy's
hands to the floor. It was said that
Lamphere was in the saloon at the
time and he became incensed at the
action of Giese.
He left the place, however, and
gave rise to his indignation to men
standing in front of the bar. He ex
pressed the determination to adminis
ter a chastising to Giese and re-enter
ing the place he struck Giese on the
jaw as the latter was lifting a glass
of beer to his mouth.
The blow was a terrific one and
landed solidly on the chin. Giese was
taken to the Long Prairie hospital, his
jaw factured in several places, includ
ing severe breaks at the back, beneath
the ear and at the chin. It was neces
sary to wire the jaw together in order
that the bones might properly mend
and it was two months before Giese
was able to leave the hospital.
In the meantime Lamphere was de
tained on the charge of assault and
he was tried before a jury in Morri
son county district court andl found
guilty. He was sentenced to the state
reformatory, after which the civil ac
tion was opened. The verdict was for
the plaintiff and the judgment entry
is now made as a result of me verdict
in the civil suit. .i.
Mesdames Tourtillott, Schallern,
Weimer and E. S. Brown entertained
the Ladies' Working club of the Con
gregational church yesterday after
noon, at the church parlors.
The 10-year-old daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. James Mehan of Minneapolis
passed away Monday night from scar
let fever, after a short illness. Mrs.
Mehan is known here, having lived
here. She is the daughter of Mirs.
Mary Newman.
Gordon Wallace visited his parents
here the first of the week, enroute to
Mobridge, S. D., to be employed! in the
office of the division superintendent
of the C. M. & St. P. railway. He was
transferred to that place from Fargo,
where he has (been for some time.
The sudden turn from cold to warm
weather the first of the week had the
effect of melting practically all of the
snow, especially in this city. The ice
in the river is getting quite porous and
it is believed that with a continuance
of warm weather it will go out within
a week or ten days.

WHY "NOT SJXKE THi&£.vWZIBB?
Why N«t Have Sleighs Wide kg tHr:
Ordinary Standard Guage Wagon?
Spooner News: Why not have sleighs
just as wide as the ordinary standard
guage wagon? This is the question that
seems to us should be 'brought up in
this state and a movement for the
wider sleigh instituted as soon as pos
sible. The disadvantage of .the narrow
sleighs is readily apparent to alL In
case they were all of standard guage,
the same ruts that would fit the sleighs
would also fit automobiles and other
vehicles and the season for their use
greatly added to. While we realize
that the cost of changing the sleigh
beams would mean a good deal to
many farmers, still Minnesota might
well follow the example of Wisconsin
and exempt all wide beamed sleighs
from taxation for a period of years.
This would offset the cost of the ehange
and besides would aet as an induce
ment for the use of the wider ones.
How many teamsters have not spent
hours reloading the overturned nar
row sleighs with his load of wood or
piled up grain sacks spilled because
of the general use of too narrow
sleighs nor can any of us forget the
spills in the snow bank of some jolly
sleighing party and the cold feet and
colder fingers we suffered in. conse
qnence, The wide beamed sleigh
TCOnld -®J away* frit"te maajr of' these
accidents and" -many a .man who lost
his life beneath his overturned load
would today be numbered among our
industrious citizens.
