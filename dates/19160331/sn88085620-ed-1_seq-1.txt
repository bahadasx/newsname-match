A. F. of L. Wants
Peace Conference
Washington, D. C, March 26, 1916.
To the Organized Labor Movement of
All Countries:
Friends and Brothers. — Will you
send a representative to attend a La
bor's World Peace Congress? This
congress to be held at the same time
and in the same city as the represen
tatives from the different countries
will meet to determine the terms of
peace.
The American Federation of Labor
convention, held November, 1914,
four months after the war began,
adopted a resolution which provided
for the calling of a Labor Congress
for the same time and place that the
general peace congress shall be held,
which will determine conditions and
terms of peace at the close of the
war. This action was officially com
municated to all national trade union
centers. The proposal to hold a la
bor congress was generally discussed
by the various national labor move
ments during the past year and some
of them have officially approved the
plan.
In other countries, thought is con
centrated on the immediate and com
pelling problems of daily life —prob-
lems so urgent that all else must wait
upon the future. We appreciate the
intense strain with which our fellow
workers of Europe await the outcome
of the day's struggle on the battle
field and the ultimate decision of the
war.
We are not unmindful of the issues
involved for which men are shedding
their blood and giving their lives. We
too have been confronted by national
problems which have grown out of
war conditions, and now our great
concern is that out of the horrors, the
suffering, the destruction of war,
there shall come greater opportunity,
freedom and protection for those who
do the world's work—the toilers of
all countries.
Everywhere the wage-earners by
service have proved their loyalty to
concepts of honor, their patriotism,
their value as men and women. In
the past they have borne not only the
burdens of fighting during the war,
but have been weighted down by the
war debts and readjustments attend
ing a return to peace conditions.
The workers can refuse to be the
victims of the blunderers, the evil
plans, the ambitions of those respon
sible for this war. In their struggle
against oppression have been born
yearnings for human freedom, for bet
ter opportunities, for justice in life
and work. During the centuries they
have made progress—sometimes slow,
it is true, but always progress. It
has been a long fight from slavery to
the present degree of freedom.
BIG CHANCE AHEAD
There is great opportunity in the
immediate future for democracy and
ft dpm, A century ago the feudal
system died in the Napoleonic wars
that convulsed Europe, and the third
estate established their right to free
dom and participation in the affairs
of government and society.
INJUNCTION JUDGES
DENY FREE SPEECH
CHICAGO. —"It may seem strange
that the question whether peaceful
picketing is legal In some of our
states should have to be seriously
discussed at this late day," says the
Illinois State Federation of Labor
Weekly News Letter.
"Have not American citizens the
fundamental rights of free speech,
moral suasion and the like? What
is peaceful picketing? Nothing but
another name for the exercise of
these rights. To use the public
streets, to move about peaceably, to
approach and present facts and ar
guments to fellow workers, or would
be workers, in search of jobs—this is
peaceful picketing. How can it be
illegal?
"In all states where peaceful pick
eting is enjoined and punished by
judges without sanction of organic
or statutory law the need of persist
ent education and agitation of the
question is most urgent. Organized
labor cannot surrender this right in
a single state.
"In Illinois the situation is very
peculiar. In recent cases, Chicago
judges have held flatly that, no mat
ter what they might personally think
under 'old' supreme court decisions
—in truth, mere dicta—they are cora
Slowly but surely the workers have
been making demands for recognition
of their rights as human beings and
as members of society and have es
tablished many of them.
Since the outbreak of war, their
economic importance, their political
and military power have been tacitly
and often officially recognized. States
men have recognized that organiza
tions of wage-earners are an integral
part of organized society—part of the
vitals of the nation.
In appreciation of their dignity and
value, it is the duty of the wage-earn
ers to make demands upon the world
assembled in the next world congress
that nothing touching the lives of the
workers shall be determined without
taking counsel with them. Such a
demand made by the personal repre
sentatives of the wage-earners as-
sembled in the same place and at the
same time as the world peace con
gress would have a tremendous ef-
feet upon the spirit and the determi
nations of that congress.
Such a demand would set high
standards of democracy and would
give prominence to principles of hu
man welfare that could not be ig
nored.
The labor movement is the great
humanizing, democratizing force, in
the affairs of nations, and it must
have a place wherever the welfare
of the wage-earners is concerned.
If demands are not made they can
be ignored with good consciences.
But when ideals of human welfare,
the rights and interests of the corn-
mon people are presented and urged
in world tribunals, they can not be
wholly rejected. These demands will
not be presented or considered unless
the wage-earners send their represen-
:atives. This labor congress is a
obligation we owe to our ideals and
to fellow-workers of the present and
the future as well as a great oppor
tunity.
MUST HAVE VOICE IN PEACE
CONGRESS
The problem is to have the fullest
and the best representation in the
labor congress and through it a voice
and influence in the world congress.
I The report of the executive coun
cil to the thirty-fifth annual conven
tion of the American Federation of
Labor, held In San Francisco begin
ning November 8, 1916, contained a
plan for the holding of the proposed
labor's peace congress. The plan is
ecessarily flexible and broad — the
purpose is to insure full representa
tion from the workers of all countries
and you are urged to communicate
with me as soon as possible, express
ing the attitude of the labor move
ment of your country upon this plan.
The plan approved by the Amer
ican Federation of Labor contains the
following general suggestions:
Let every national center affiliated
to tlie International Federation of
Trade Unions send not more than
two delegates to the conference. The
labor movement of any country, even
(Continued on Page Two)
polled to enjoin any and every kind
of picketing. In other words, in the
state of Illinois, they say, there is no
such thing, in the eyes of the law, as
'peaceful picketing.' Not even a sin
gle person may walk in front of a
factory or shop whose employes are
on strike for the purpose of quietly
presenting arguments or facts to
misled applicants for jobs.
"Why? Because the judges say
that some pickets are violent or
threaten violence; that some pickets
use abusive epithets. Because some
pickets walk in groups and by their
mere presence intimidate certain
workers; that peaceful picketing is
sometimes a 'pretence,' that actual
pitcketing being aggressive and law
less, designed and calculated to In
spire fear and prevent men from ex
ercising their right to work where
they please.
"This is singular logic. Is an inno-
cent man to suffer and have his legal
rights taken away from him because
another man has overstepped the
bounds of the law? Is peaceful pick-
eting illegal because some persons
call violence peaceful? Violence in
any case Is illegal. Then why not
make peaceful picketing legal and
hold to an accountability under the
general statutes applying to all those
who engage in violence?"

NEWS AND VIEWS OF
THE WORLD OF LABOR
WAVES OF ILLITERATES
AFFECT WORKERS' LIVES
WHEELING, W. Va.- -Editor Hilton
of the Wheeling Majority makes this
vigorous defense of organized labor's
demand for immigration restriction:
"Hy a beautiful arrangement of the
employers, working class progress to
ward a higher standard of living has
heretofore been retarded. When men,
by organization, secured better con
ditions the employers brought
in thousands of an alien race. When
that race organized they brought in
another accustomed to a lower stand
ard. Wave upon wave of immigra
tion has thus held the American work
ers down to a subsistence level; every
time they were in a fair way to get
control over their labor power by
class solidarity, a new group, unused
to American ways, unable to grasp
American ideals, unable to speak the
American tongue, have been swept
here by unscrupulous employers and
steamship agents.
"Wave after wave has washed
away our economic and political edi
fices as they were slowly reared by
sacrifice and struggle. Thus the la
bor movement, everywhere has been
brought to demanding an immigra
tion law that will restrict our new
arrivals to those capable of being
talked to and reasoned with.
"The brotherhood of man is a law
of nature that can be effective only
when it benefits both parties—can
be adopted only when it conforms to
the first law, self preservation."
HUGE PROFITS IN LOCOMOTIVES
PHILADELPHIA. —In its report for
the year ending Dec. 15, 1915, the
Baldwin Locomotive Works shows net
earnings of $3,510,383, against $981,
--754 during the preceding year.
The production of the year amount
ed to $19,339,934 of locomotives and
the other usual products of the works,
and to $2,743,077 of other work result
ing from the war.
The Baldwin concern styles itself
an "open shop," which means that a
trade unionist jeopardizes his position
if he openly advocates organization
by the workers.
TEAMSTERS SECURE CONTRACT
SEATTLE.—A three-years' contract
has been signed by the Teamsters'
union and the Team Owners' associa-
tion. Three years ago these em
ployers attempted to smash the team
sters' union, which resulted in one of
of Seattle's most serious industrial
disturbances. Now the employers
have concluded to do business along
twentieth century lines.
PICTURE OPERATORS WIN
ST. LOUIS.—The Eagle theatre has
signed an agreement with Moving
Picture Operators' union No. 143.
thereby ending a long controversy.
The unionists picketed this theatre
continuously for 17 months.
ARE WORKERS "UNGRATEFUL?"
BOSTON. —At the banquet of the
Boston Paper Trade Association two
sides of the social uplift question in
industry were presented. Some of the
Speakers urged music in the factory
and football and baseball as amuse
ments, with an occasional banquet
for foremen and workers, which was
declared to be a good investment.
Congressman Winslow of Worcester,
however, was not impressed with the
effectiveness of social uplift. He
said workers do not appreciate the
measures adopted "in their behalf,"
and he wanted the efficiency experts
to tell him why it is that, with all
this uplift, the fellows who strike
first and stay out longest are work
ing in factories that "treat them
best." Congressman Winslow pro
tested against manufacturers who
happen to be. enjoying temporary
prosperity paying a scale of wages
above that which the average manu
facturer can afford.

MINERS WANT LEGISLATION
WILKES BARRE, Pit - Miners in
the anthracite district ba\ c started a
non-partisan movement for the elec
tion of candidates who are favorable
to the following legislatim:
An amendment to the workmen's
compensation law, increasing the
amount to be paid for total disability
and extending the time for which pay
ments shall be made; also compensa
tion for occupational diseases.
Old age pension law.
The extension of the bureau of the

tive in all parts of the state.
An amendment to the law providing
for mothers' pensions, and increasing
the amount to be padd.

GET $9.34 A WEEK; STRIKE
PHILADELPHIA. —Th c unorgan
ized employes of the I'.ristol mills are
striking to enforce a wage demand of
$11 a week. They have been receiv
ing $9.34 a week and declare it is im
possible for them to <upport a fam
ily on these rates. The mills are
owned by Joseph R, Grundy, presi
dent of the Pennsylvania Manufactur
ers' association. Mr. Grundy led the
fight against the child labor law,
passed by the last legislature, and
the strike he now aces would indi
cate he has other reasons to oppose
child labor legislation than the fear
that children will acquire bad habits
if they are taken from mills, mines
and factories.
BIG EARNINGS IN STEEL
NEW YORK—Th.' annual report
of the United States Steel Corpora
tion shows that during 1915 this con
cern earned 1140,250,000, or an in
crease of $58,503,5 is over the pre
vious year.
The annual report of the Bethle
hem Steel Company shows a net in-
come for 1915 of $17,762,812.12, as
against $5,590,020.1* in 1914. This is
equal, after preferred dividends have
been paid, to 112 per cent, on the
common stock, as against 33 per cent
in 1914.
STATE COSSACKS FAVORED
ALBANY, N. Y. A mounted state

EVERETT TRADES COUNCIL
OF ORGANIZED LABOR.
; PRESIDENT GOMPERS
URGES CONGRESS TO
PROBE PORTO RICO
WASHINGTON. — "Bights assured
Porto Rico workers under Spanish
domination are, denied them now,"
declared President Gompers, last
Wednesday, before the senate com
mittee on Pacific islands and Porto
j Rico.
The A. P. of L. executive urged
that congress appoint a commission
to investigate conditions in that isl
and before legislation of a fundamen
tal character is adopted.
"And let that commission accept
every courtesy from Porto Rican of
ficials," he said, "but let it go to the
heart of the people, victims of cruel
injustice by exploiters who have been
given every assistance by the gov
ernment."
Senator Vardaman asked President
Gompers if this was the "same crowd
of buccaneers that is in the United
States."
"They are more conscienceless, for
these forces in this country can not
run amuck as they do in Porto Rico,"
replied the unionist, who spoke from
first-hand knowledge because of his
recent visit to that country.
It was stated that in the present
strike of agriculturalists men are
cluhbed, orders are issued that meet
ings of two or more persons shall not
be permitted, and workers are as
saulted, threatened, coerced and in
timiated against exercising their in
herent rights. President Gompers sub
mitted a mass of testimony and cor
respondence to the committee rela
tive to the treatment of workers. He
read one typical letter in which a
government official defended a police
man who clubbed strikers. The offi
cial said that if the policeman did not
club these strikers, the tatter might
become dangerous, and jthat since
the strike was over the "policeman
would be reprimanded."
In closing his appeal that the sen
ate committee favor a Porto Rico in
vestigating commission before any
Porto Rico organic legislation is
passed, President Gompers said:
"The organized workers of Porto
Rico is the only element that will
bind the ties between that country
and the United States. Every oher
element stands for destruction or are
separatists."
LOW WAGE WORKERS STRIKE
CHlCAGO.—Because of a strike of
several hundred workers, the im
mense plant of the Corn Products
Refining company ai Argo. the larg
est of its kind in the world, was forc
ed to suspend operations. The strik

Many of them are receiving but 17Vi

running at top capacity, consuming
65,000 bushels of corn a day and turn

Eight-Hour Mo vement
Is Growing
(From Committee on Industrial Re
lations, Washington, D. C.)
WASHINGTON.—The organised la
bor movement of America is rallying
as one man to its demand for an S
hotir working day. Never before has
this demand been so insistent and so
compelling. Never before has labor
had such magnificent opportunity to
enforce by its own efforts the appli
| cation of a working day that gives the
citizen who works the time and op
portunity to become, in the words of
President Gompers of the American
Federation of Labor, "a human being
with intellectual desires and crav
ings."
The Labor Center Association of
New York City has just recently giv
en fine assistance to labor to express
and get before the American public
its righteous demands for the eight
hour day. All groups and organiza
tions and agencies of publicity that
recognize the rights of labor are giv
ing voice to the same compelling de
mand.
The splendid work of Samuel Gom
pers, voicing the organized labor
movement, has placed the eight-hour
day on an impregnable rock of jus
tice and righteousness. President
Gompers said:
"The individual who works eight
hours or less does not each day ex
haust his energy. He has time for
recuperation and something more.
His mind is more alert and active.
He is capable of more vigorous and
more effective work. He goes to and
from work at a time when well
dressed people are on the streets. He
really has time and opportunity for
making comparisons and forming de
sires. He has longer time to stay at
home, sees other homes better fur
nished, and consequently wants a bet
ter home for himself, He wants
books, pictures, friends, entertain
ment. In short, he becomes a human
being with intellectual desires and!
cravings. This change makes him a
more valuable worker. Because hisj
standard of living has changed he de
nmands higher wages. Men and wor-
CREDIT BILL AGAINST CITY
WORKERS AND FARMERS
(From Committee on Industrial Re
lations, Washington, n. c.)
Representative Lindberg of Mm
Desota says in a report against the
fake rural credits hill known as the
Moss Rill in this congress
| "This proposed rural credit system j
! avoids taking anything that the banks!
want. Since they want everything
that la of value, the farmers are of
fered nothing of value in this bill."
The bill is a positive, definite in
jury to working people of the citiei
as well as to farmers.
If this bad Moss bill is enacted it
will make it more difficult than ever
for the city worker or the tenant
farmer to get access to the land—or
for the borrowing farmer to get re
lief.
The same banking monopoly that
has its grip on factory industry will
extend its power, through this bill,
over agricultural industry.
A right rural credit system will de
velop "better credit facilities through
the assistance of the government and
co-operative organizations of farmers
and tenants." as the main report of
the Commission on Industrial Rela
tions recommends.
Have your congressmen and sena
tors kill this sham Moss Rural Credits
Bill —which is designed by the pri
vate banking monopoly to delay real
rural credits and to destroy the op
portunities of the landless man to de
