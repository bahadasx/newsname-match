SCHOOL ELECTION
District No. 15 Will Elect One Trustee Tomorrow Afternoon.
Tomorrow a school trustee will be selected by the voters
of School District No. 15, to serve for a period of three years.
Two candidates for the office have fiUd petitions, Mrs. Clay
McLean of Ekalaka and Mr. U. L. M<d-.ay. who resides about
ten miles west of town.
A circular letter signed by John Oliver, and winch was
printed by the Baker Sentinel, has n distributed among
the voters of the district, endorsing the cause of Mr. McKay.
The letter uf its commencement, ass rts that there are 265
children of school age residing within District 15, 83 of these
living in Ekalaka and 182 residing ouisido of the town. Other
statistics as to valuation and population are given and the
Statement made that the district at.-ide of the coi porate
limits of Ekalaka is not getting a fa:r deal, that outside resi
dents are being taxed to pay the bonded indebtedness of the
district and that the money is ah ;wing into the Ekalaka
school.
But are there 182 country school children and 83 in the
town school? The school records show us that there are en
rolled in Ekalaka 124 pupils 80 of v» I • :n. are from the district
outside of the town limits.
And is the money all going toward the support of the
town school? We quote from Mr. Oliver's letter:
"There was paid out as shown o
no;
( com
he sum of 8-1,012.80 fio.n N pternber 1, ID®, to
<•> >b.oo was paid out
thin the limits of the
>.50 was paid out for
treasurer
March 20, 191(1, and of this amount.
for material and services render«
town of Ekalaka, and the sum of
services rendered for the schools outside of the limits of the
town."
It would seem then that the com.try schools ate getting
more than a third of the apportionmi tit for their support.
As to the matter of the country y- sidents being- taxed to
pay the bonded indebtedness of the dhniet, which fut-d was
expended for a school building in El.; laka, any fair-minded
man or woman' will see that the t-w. ,i had to have a good
school building and a force of tcache, rs ' bat. coule; intelii ently
conduct a standard school. The town school is natural : v the
head of the district system and theo is attached to a more
expense of construction and maintenance than to I he various
country schools. Wo believe that th" people of the country

h The affair.-, of the school
distance of Mi-s Ma», y Lee
enols, Mr. Oliver rtw-dgned
[fairs of the district were
know that immediately
Oliver, the wages of the
town teachers were lowered and the country teachers in the
district were allowed a substantial increase in salary; five tons
of coal were furnished each country school and their condi
tion otherwise improved. Why should, Mr. Oliver's attitude
be changed squarely around from what it was last year, when
Mrs. Oliver was a candidate, and in years previous? Why
has he so unexpectedly become the champion of the country
school?
John Oliver has made the statement that if he again
gains control of the school board he will make a general
"cleaning" from janitor to clerk. And this is one promise
that we believe he would keep.
Do we want to see Oliver pick a man to run the new $1600
heating plant that the voters are paying for now, when, had
it not been for one of his "mistakesthis $1600 would have
been, spent for improvements in the country schools?
Do we. want a repetition of the turbulent and unharmon
i.ous times that prevailed, when Honest John was on the job
beforeDo we want to sec Oliver supplant the ivell -ordered
and satisfactory school system of this district with ai chaotic
one-man ;•< gime? Do we want to see Billy Freese ousted from
his position as clerk of the board when he. has served, wisely
ami well, as trustee or clerk, for sixteen years?
We do not believe that the highly-colored pre-election
promises made by Mr. Oliver are going to influence the calm
judgment of the voters to any great extent. We have at
hand a letter which was sent out over Mrs. Oliver's name
last year, when she was a candidate for school trustee, in
which the voters in the district outside of town were prom
ise i: "Toe schools conducted in the outside sections will be
given the same careful attention as the town school and I
believe they should have just as much school as should the
town
// is J .anted that the country terms last spring, after
Mrs. Oliver assumed the chairmanship of the board, were a
men 'h shorter than t'nr year before even, Mrs. Oliver being in
fae<,r of the curtailment.
We do not doubt, but that Mrs. McLean would gladly
sign a published statement promising the country portion of
the district a square deal in every way possible. In fact she
has mad. such a statement verbally, as has also Board Mem
ber lb 11. Ferguson.
but we have based our argument more upon future pos
sibilities as they are forecasted by past events, rather than
upon the doubtful ground of pre-election promises.
