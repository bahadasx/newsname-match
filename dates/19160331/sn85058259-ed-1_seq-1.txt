. ", for This Section.
y The following letter addressed to
f Hon. John Parry of this city is sclf-
explanatory, and ia along the lino of
' t' the article that appeared in The Rec-
a ord last week. It was handed to us
f by Mr. Parry with tho request that
t the same bo given publicity:
Salt Like City, Utah, March 28.
I Mr. John Parry, Cedar City, Utah.
, p. Dear Friend. According to promise,
.' i I write you progress on the matter
of working up sales of lands in your
valley. I havo been in conference
with one California outfit and one
7 eastern one, who think they can bring
' in Bettlers, if we can get the right
t kind of a base on which to work. None
'v of these concerns care to consider a
j proposition of this kind unless there
'- are enough lands available to make it
worth while, as there is such a tre
mendous expenso to get the working
machinery into shape and to do tho
preliminary advertising and work in
assembling the working force. It
costs practically as much to sell 10,-
000 acres as it would to sell 20,000, so
tf far as the preliminary expenso goes.
m Twenty Thousand Acres Needed.
T j This being the case, -we will want to
- Wit''neplsn' if not quite the 20,000
r' ' have promised us their assistance, but
they, too, say we ought to get prac-
i , tically 20,000, I know the land is
: ' there and that tho people can spare
f it and more, too, and thon have plenty
for themselves and families; and if
, tho proposition is to materialize, the
land owners must bo liberal in listing
, largo tracts of their lands. I am do-
ing all I can to holp the matter along,
J and havo enlisted some vital forces,
and things look encouraging to me,
'Va1-' from this end.
If the proposition fails, I feel it will
not be because we cannot get tho sot-
i tiers on tho lands, but it will bo be-
-1 cause tho people there are not rcspon-
I sive. When I was there it appearod
f to me that tho people were about ripo
l for such a movement, and I feel quite
J encouraged, and feel that we can make
i i it go with the people, if only we can
- get them together on tho number of
V , acres and got the price so it will bo
, attractive to, tho men that havo tho
!, -placing of tho settlers on the lands.
', Urged to List Lands Liberally.
w I would like for you to dp all you
, , ' can to help the movement by putting
in about 1,000 acres of your meadow
lands and getting Gordello Brown and
a number of your relatives and friends
t to list with you. If this is done, I feel
1 , that others will be encouraged to come
. , in and wo will then get enough to-
.i . gether to make it go, and thereby
1 bring prosperity to your section. It
means 200 more families of a good
1 type and a great development of your
n lands, making tho remainder of your
' lands worth double to treble within
v three to four years.
( If the people could only know what
this means to your section there would
be no trouble in getting the lands, on
a basis that they will bo protected,
and a selling ngency have time and
i protection in bringing settlers on
them.
lv .Will Bring Railroad to Cedar City.
' 'r"T Mr. Manderfield of the Salt Lake
Routo has promised all tho help his
I road can give, and made tho state-
ment that, as soon as wo get the 200
I families into the valley and working
J , on tho lands, the railroad will com-
I monco laying track to Cedar City; so
I you Bee it will bring a great era of
I I prosperity to you people just tho
" thing you havo been striving for and
I wanting for years.
Just as soon as I can develop a lit
tle more at this end, I want to come
j . down to Cedar prepared to get you
people together and have you sign up,

I . working plan pretty well matured, so

DISCOURAGEMENT8.
Got tho right attltudo and get

you're on tho wrong Uub. For
you can't go tho limit In pleas

Job with tho hard-working guys.
And for you to start slipping
will glvo you tho blues, then
discouragement comes and
you'ro listed to lose. So got
wlso in tho start and llvo simple
and plain. Thcro Is nothing
you'll miss, but there's much
you will gain. Your dlscourago-
. ments always are backed by a
causo, for thoy show you aro
shy on obeying tho laws. And
tho moods of dlscouragomcnt
stand In your way. You con
never succeed and permit thorn
to" stay. It is all up to you ami
It's In your own hands. You
should think it all over and
mako your demands. And then
simply stand put when you put
tn tho claim, nnd your wnnta
will como ovor if you'ro only
gamo. Your discouragements
beat it If given a chanco. So
just chain tho bluo dovils and

the contracts, options, etc.
You have always been a pusher for
good things, and I want you to stand
by this movement, as tho most prom
ising thing that has come to you, for
it seems that now is the right time
for this movement to precede other
events that will shortly follow, to
make a great country in the Cedar
and Parowan vallics.
I asked Gron. Parry to keep a watch
on matters there and do what he could
to push the proposition, by encourag
ing the land owners to list their lands,
and I wish you would let him read this
letter and work with,ryou"'to""crente
the right kind of a sentiment with the
people. Tell the people to send their
listings to mo at Nephi, as much of
tho advancement here depends on the
kind of responses I get from tho land
owners.
Wo havo less than half enough now
listed, so you see we will want all we
can get. We ought to be ready for
tho options to bo signed within three
to five weeks.
Again I ask you to consider the
matter of your listing at least 1,000
acres of your meadow lands and a lot
of your brush lands. It will help tho
cause, and I feel bo a blessing to you,
in that it will relieve you of some
burden.
I assure you I appreciate your in
terest in my work in the past and
hope to merit your confidence in tho
future.
With kindest regaids to yourself
and family, I remain,
Very truly your friend,

P. S. Write me at 701 East, 9th

until after conference.
The Record wishes to urge that the
people of tho Cedar Valley, and par
ticularly those who have largo hold
ings of unimproved land, give careful
consideration to tho article which ap
peared in our Inst issue nnd tho letter
printed on this page today, from Mr.
J. W. Paxmnn, in relation to the list
ing of surplus land and the advertis
ing of the same, with a view to getting
additional settlers in hero to develop
tho country with us.
For a good many yenrs now we have
been struggling along to keep things
going and hold onto a large acreage
of land for tho sake of our posterity,
and with tho idea that it would some
day becomo very valuable, (which is
no doubt true) borrowing money on
tho land in a vory great many in
stances and working our heads off to
keep up tho interest payments, with
no possiblo prospect, apparently, of
meeting the principal. At tho Bamo
time playing the part of the "dog in
tho manger" nnd preventing people
able and anxious to dovclop tho land
from doing so; thus holding back ev
ery business enterprise launched in
our locality, and blocking tho way u
galnst the building of a railroad for
this section.
Such a course is nonsensical in tho
extreme, nnd now that an opportunity
is at hand for unloading a portion of
our holdings and providing monoy for
the development of the balnnce, tho
pooplo should not bo slow in availing
j themselves of it.

COX BOOSTING
ALL WINTER ROUTE
Sees Governor and State Road
Commission in Interest of
"Old Mormon Trail."
NEVADA AND CALIFORNIA
ARE DOING GOOD WORK
Seeks Convict Labor to Put Road from
St. George to Arizona Line
in Good Condition.
(Snlt Lake Tribune.)
Warren Cox, n well-known St.
Gcorgo business man, was in Snlt Lako
yesterday to sco Governor William
Spry and members of the state road
commission.
A largo yellow and red button in the
lapel of Mr. Cox's coat explained at a
glance tho purposo of his conference
with tho state ofllcials. This button
boro the legend, "All-year-round auto
road, Salt Lake to Los Angeles the
old Mormon trail."
Mr. Cox camfl to take up with tho
governor nnd the rond commission the
request of Utah's Dixio citizens to
havo convicts put to work next fall
and winter on roads in Washington
county, which will bo a part of the
Salt Lake and Los Angeles "all-year-round"
auto highway.
"Nevada and California," said Mr.
Cox, "have been doing a lot of work
nnd spending a lot of money on this
route within their borders and we feel
that it is time Utah was doing some
thing. All the people in our part of
, tho state are very enthusiastic over
this route from Salt Lako to Califor
nia. Now wo want to get Salt Lako
I City interested. And wo particularly
' vant togeithe governor andjtho.rpad,
! commission interested. Tho fall nnd
winter months aro ideal for road work
in Washington county. Wo aro hope
ful that we can get the convicts start
ed to work there early in September."
Mr. Cox said that the only work in
Utah necessary to mako the route fea
sible was in Washington County. Tho
route from Salt Lake to Dixie would
bo by way of tho present roads thru
Cedar City into "Dixie." South of
St. George the route is across tho San
ta Clara bench, past the Indian school
farm and over what are known as tho
West mountains, into the northwest
corner of Arizona. Beyond the route
is through Clark county, Nevada, to
Las Vegas and thence on to Los Ange
les, on roads which follow the Salt
Lako Route. "Tourists on this high
way," said Mr. Cox, "are near towns
and the railroad all the way and it is
the shortest auto route to Los Angeles
by over 200 miles."
Mr. Cox called upon state ofllcials
at the cnpitol yesterday, in the inter
eat of the road work.
can get more for our land by holding
it. It will be worth more than thoy
will pay for it now." Quito true, but
can you tell just how long you will
have to hold it in order to obtain the
price you feel that it should bring
you? And in tho mean time is it not
true that you are retarding the devel
opment of tho entire valley by hold
ing on indefinitely to something that
you aro unablo to make use of? And
thus standing in your own light as
well as that of tho balanco of the com
munity. Of course, wo do not advlso
anyone to list Jand that they aro put
ting to a beneficial use, or which they
aro in a position to use in tho near
future to advantage. But the curso
of this country, and the mill stone
which is dragging it down Is the ap
propriated but unimproved property,
both farm and city, and if people will
neither use nor sell it, the assessment
for taxes should bo increased to such
an extent as to mako it unprofitable
to hold it.
For our part wo believe that tho
people should give Mr. Paxman an
opportunity of exploiting and placing
settlers on a largo portion of the land
of this valley which is now lying idle.
More population will mean greater
prosperity for everyone, and is ono of
tho commodities wo need most.

Enterprise, Utah, March 27, 1910.
Editor Record. I havo been re
quested to submit tho accompanying
cssny on Dairying, nnd if you think it
Worthy, you may give it publicity in
your columns:
A dairy 1b something loss than a
thousand cows kept on tho farm to
mako enough work for mother to keep
her from getting lonesome. I havo
even seen tho boys do part of tho
work.
Take a pleco of 8x2 plank nbout bo
long and boro a holo in tho center.
Insert a picco of oak for a leg just
long enough to reach from whore you
want to sit while milking, to tho
ground. This is called a milk-stool,
and is to be used under tho man and
not on top of tho cow.
If tho young calf refuses to drink
milk from tho pnil the first time,
catch it by tho back of tho neck, push
its head down into tho milk all over,
and proceed to kick it four times in
tho ribs. This will tench the calf that
you aro a knave. I know, for I have
tried it.
If a cow steps in tho bucket while
you aro milking, get up and throw
the milk in her face. Then get a
good sized shclnli and proceed to
lambast her seven times across said
leg. This will not break her of step
ping in the bucket, but it may break
her leg; and anyhow, four legs arc
too many for ono cow.. Besides this
method will show what a magnificlcnt
temper you have.
If a cow kicks you, it means that
she wants you to go away and quit
milkintr. If vou are not ready to do
this, don't attempt to caress her with
the aforedescribed milk-stool. She
will not understand nor appreciate
your fondness. It is too pronounced

a piece of half inch rope nbout eight
feet long and proceed to tether her
rear legs together, in a very cool ahd
unimpassioned tone of voice.
If you have trouble in getting the
milk to sour, just quit scalding tho
milk utensils and go to washing them
in tho cold dishwater, after having
washed the breakfast dishes.' Also,
quit washing tho separator twlco a
day as has been your custom, and only
wash it once a week. This method is
guaranteed to produce sour milk. It
will also take that fresh taste out of
tho butter.
Just feed tho cows a little wheat
straw and chaff. Of course, they
won't give enough milk to pay for
milking them on thiB kind of feed,
but what do you care for tho money?
You are just milking them for fun.
Don't quote scripture to the cows
when you are irritated. They havo no
appreciation for ancient history. Bo
sides, in your haste and oxcitement
you may get the scripture twisted in
your mind and misquote it.
If your cow loses her cud, loan her
your gum. JOB F. HALLL.

THE COUNTY FAIR .
COMMITTEE ACTIVE I
Fix Dates for Coming Fair for H
September G, 7 and 8, and
Start Active Work. U
CLEARING BRUSH FROM H
PERMANENT F.AIR SITE
Mayor and City Council Promise Loy-
al Support This Year's Fair H
to'Set the Pace. H
The push nnd energy that is being M
evinced by tho county fair committee lll
is certainly reassuring and lends one 111
to tho conclusion that tho fair this H
year is going to be n huge success jjH
something far in advance of anything H
heretofore attempted here. 'In tho H
first place', n moro scnsonabla com- H
menccment is being made. It has nl- . M
ways been ono of the gravo mistakes '
of previous fairs that wo havo been t
too late starting. Pcoplo havo had M
their farming and gardening all dono
before they wcro given the slightest M
inkling as to whnt prizes wcro to bo lH
awarded. A month or two, at most,
before the holding of the fair, a grand M
spurt has been mnde a premium list
rushed off tho press,a few temporary '
sheds and pens, possibly a flimsy 'M
grand stnnd constructed, n few exhib- M
its hurriedly collected, nnd presto! M
Hurrah for tho County Fnirl No H
wonder tho pcoplo havo refused to
becomo enthused with such n prospect. '
But this year, apparently, it is go- M
ing to be different. In addition to tho H
fact that a much earlier start is being
made, work of a substantial character ,
is already being done. Even now a H
largo crowd of men and boys nro busy lLl
'laying' out tT IWdkII mSftdT'racir ' " W TH
track, etc. Tho committee is planning
tho location for tho livestock pens, tho j
grnnd stand, and other features, nnd jH
it is tho expectation to oxpend not less 1
than $2,000 in tho preparation of tho lH
sito for the fair. Improvements nro H
to bo of u permanent character, which ;H
will answer for future fairs, nnd will H
be used each year that tho fair is held i
Tho site is being supplied by tho IH
city, and tho council has promised to lfl
put both irrigation and culinary water 'l
thero as soon as needed, and to fence M
tho property. Citizens are subscribing tH
liberally to help tho causo, both in il
labor and meanB. Under theso con-
ditions, and with so many boosters 'H
for tho undertaking, tho fair cannot H
fail to prove a complete success. H
Another now depnrturo this year is H
the giving of special valuable prizes H
to bo specifically announced shortly, H
for the best aero of wheat, potatoes, H
and othor products, taking into con- H
sideration tho yield as well as tho H
quality of the samples exhibited. This H
cannot fail to havo a stimulating of- H
feet upon tho agricultural industries H
of tho county. v H
Date Fixed for Fair. 'H
Another matter that is of consider- 'H
ablo consequence in connection with H
the fair is the selecting of tho dates H
for the fair thus early. 'They havo H
been fixed by tho committee for Sept. H
l G, 7, and 8. It will bo noted that tho H
I dates havo been set a little earlier wb-H
I this year than usual, with a view to 'H
I getting tho fair off before tho opening wM
of the schools, so that thoro will bo 9BB
no conflict. fiK
Wo trust that the commltteo will $$
bo supported and backed up in their M?
worthy iflforts by every loyal citizen !&&
of tho county, and that tho fair this "Vyf
year will set a now pace for county ' jgwV
faira in this county. , $l
