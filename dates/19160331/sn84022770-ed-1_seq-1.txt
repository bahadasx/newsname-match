BUT MUST ORGANIZE, STANDARD,
IZE PRODUCTION AND MARKET
CO-OPERATIVELY.
Prompted to reply to the article by
Sylvester Smith, recently published,
because he thinks "some of the im
pressions he may have conveyed
should be corrected," Lee C. Lewis,
son of Fred W. Lewis of Brighton
Park, and a graduate of the agricul
tural department of Washington
State College, at present engaged as
tester for a cow-testing association
in the Walla Walla district, sent the
following letter to The Washington
Standard this week:
Editor Standard:
As a usual thing I am against the
idea of newspaper controversies, but
the article of Mr. Sylvester Smith in
your issue of March 3 was so regret
ably bitter and sarcastic that I think
some of the impressions he may have
conveyed should be corrected. Mr.
Smith's mental attitude seems to be
similar to that of the spoiled child
who will neither pull out an offend
ing splinter nor allow anyone else to
do it, because he's having such a
good time letting everyone know how
miserable he Is.
From my experience and observa
tion in several other sections of
Washington, I wish to correct Mr.
Smith's plaint that Thurston county
is not a farming country. He seems
to think it exorbitant that a man
must pay SIOO an acre to clear land,
but if he will take the pains to com
pare his section with the other sec
tions he will find that that is about
as cheap as preparing land for irriga
tion and paying for water every year.
Farming Require* Capital.
I admit that the "ordinary farm
er" can't make very much money, but
neither can the "ordinary merchant,"
for farming is as much of a capital
istic enterprise now as any other
business. In the farm survey made by
the State College and United States
department of agriculture in Wah
kiakum county, a county similar to
Thurston, it was shown by actual fig
ures (no theory about it at all) that
the 12 best paying farms produced a
labor income for their owner of
91,400, after Interest on Investment,
taxes, etc., were paid, but that the
capital Invested was about $17,000 in
land and $4,200 in stock, implements,
etc., making a total of $21,200.
The smaller paying farms required
less capital, but the figures show that
capital Is required for successful
farming. This is regrettable, I know,
but Mr. Smith's sarcasm won't help
change it any. The small farmer
must get along as best he can, but
must not blame the country if he
doesn't give It a fair chance and ap
ply business principles.
Now as to the Potato club, which
was the particular object of Mr.
Smith's resentment, I can't believe
that Mr. Smith spent very much real
thought on the subject. In the first
place Thurston county has never had
anything to market. They were well
started on berrleß once, but a bad
year spilled the beans and everyone
quit. However, If one will but look
at what other localities have done,
Puyallup or North Yakima for In
stance, he will take heart. If a qom»
muntty putß out a standard grade of
article and In a big enough quantity
to market economically, it will find a
market, but not otherwise.
Mr. Smith Is right when he says
supply and demand have most to do
with market, but the supply must be
worth the while of commerce or the
demand will not be very great. Yak
ima potatoes have been widely adver
tised, are a standard grade article,
and they have a definite market.
Thurston county can grow as good
potatoes, but onyl through some
form of co-operation can they be
grown in quantities, standardized and
advertised in Buch a manner as to
become very profitable.

REPUBLICANS DECIDE TO
MEET AT TENINO APRIL 22
County Convention to Be Held Out
side Olympia for First Tim©-
Sl9 Delegates.
The Republican county convention
will be held at Tenino April 22, fol
lowing caucuses in the various pre
cincts April 19 when 312 delegates,
123 of whom will hail from Olympla,
are to be chosen. This was unani

luncheon at the Elks' club attended
by some 150 persons, including a
number of women.
This will be the first time a Re

selection had been "framed up" fol
lowing a Friday night call on various
Tenino citizens by State Committee
man W. W. Hopkins. County Auditor
J. C. Sams and State Representative
L. J. Morrison, and the story goeß
that maneuvering between local sup
porters of one or the other of the
half dozen candidates for governor
had something to do with it. S. W.
Fenton extended the invitation.
Fourteen delegates and as many al
ternates to the Republican state con
vention at North Yakima in May,
will be chosen.
A* the luncheon preceding the
committee session, T. L. O'Leary,
former prosecuting attorney, pre
sided and Land Commissioner Clark
Savldge was the "dark horse" who
made the principal dinner address, a
plea for harmony all along the line
and an Invitation for all Bull Moose
wanderers to hurry home. He was
followed In turn by Scott Henderson,
C. W. Clausen, Edward Meath and I.
M. Howell, all candidates for re
election to state office except Meath.

Royal Mail Roadster to Will H. An
ders of the Bupreme court reporter's
department. W. F. Burns, a farmer
living on Chambers* Prairie, also
purchased a car from this firm this
week.
Some really good bargains in auto
mobiles, so the Rose-Nepple Auto
Agency says, are to be ottered in the
auction sale at their garage Satur
day afternoon, when opportunity
will be given for a careful examina
tion of each car before it is put up

CITY CLAIMS IT BOUGHT MA
CHINERY—WESTINUHOUBE
FIRM SAYS NOT.
Contending that the electric motor
which operates the pumps at the mu
nicipal waterworks pumping station
was included in the inventory upon
which the court judgment was based
and is therefore owned by the city,
City Attorney Oeo. R. Bigelow filed a
motion in the local superior court
Wednesday to compel the Westing
house Electric company to become a
party to an action through which the
motor would be paid for out of the
money paid into court by the city
under the verdict in the condemn*-
tlon proceedings.
The dispute over the ownership of
the property arose last week when
an attorney for the Westlnghouse
company Informed the city that Wil
bur B. Foshay, former owner of the
waterworks and also promoter of a
steam-heating and electric plant, had
bought the motor and also two trans
formers under a conditional bill of
sale, for $996 and had paid only
$l5O on the purchase price. The city
does not claim the ownership of the
transformers, as they were not listed
in the inventory of the company's
property and, according to Bigelow,
does not want them, so the dispute
centers around the electric motor,
the original price of which was |6OQ.
The contention made by the West
lnghouse people and, it Is reported*
by the old waterworks company, la.
that, since the company did not own'
this machinery, pointing to the con
ditional bill of sale on file In the
auditor's office as evidence, it could
not sell it to the city. Added to thla
contention is the further assertion
that if the city does not want to pay
'for the property the WestinghooM
company will take it back. The city
contends, however, that the Westing
house company should look to the
old company to re-lmburse It for the
amount due. 4
So far as the transformers are con
cerned, these, Bigelow believes, were
a part of the electric plant Foshay
projected but never completed, aa
was also the power line he built from
Fourth street to the pumping station*
later expecting to connect it with his x
power plant on 'the waterfront The
Olympia Light ft Power company haa
furnished and is still furnishing the
power for the pumping station over
this line, and Bigelow believes that
company Would supply any trans
formers the city may need at the
pumping plant.
