There is a growing sentiment in
this city in favor of organized base
ball, and this may so crystalize that
Ardmore may be in the Western As
sociation another year. The S')utii
em Oklahoma league, just organ!? ed.
will serve its purpose this .season,
but the real fans v,-r.;:t srmething
better, and this may awaUcn sent!
ment to such a point th.it a berth
may be secured in a real league an
other year.
Ardmore has been without baseball
for two seasons, aside from a few
amateur games. This condition is not
pleasing to a majority of the fans,
who are beginning to show a disposi
tion to finance a team in some ac
credited league, and maintain a high
class team.
The downfall of the old Texas
Oklahoma league was the high salar
ies paid the players. A lesson ha3
been learned, and is being put into
practice in the Western Association,
with the result that some of the old
has-beens who were drawing topheavy
salaries have been supplanted by a
number of youngsters who want to
break into the game at a greatly re
duced salary, and for the betterment
of the league ad a whole. In the
Texas-Oklahoma, some "old-head"
would come along with a glove and a
prayer and sign up as a hall player
at a salary that would look big in
a class A league. . The chances -were
better than even that his days of
usefulness were past long since, and
the management would be up against
the proposition of getting another
man after he had lost a few games
for the team. All this Ins been
eliminated in organized baseball
within the past two years, until it is
now possible to secure the services
of young, ambitious players at sal
aries that the towns in a class El
circuit can afford. Incidentally, the
"old heads" are back on 'ho farm
or driving a hack.
Ardmore has grown in population
and financial wealth within the past
two years, and the city officials, head
ed by the mayor, are a unit for or
ganized baseball another year, and
unless they "back up" on their state
ments, will try hard for a berth in
the Western Association another
year
