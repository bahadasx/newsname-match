BREAKING WITH
TEUTONS RESTS
WITH EVIDENCE
President and Cabinet Meet to Con
sider Phases of the
Situation.
EVIDENCE OF SURMARINE
DISASTER IS CONFLICTING
Germans Capture Village of Malan
court French Hold
Highways.
BULLETIN
Berlin, March 31.Official)
The fortified village of Malan
court has been captured by the
Germans.
Paris, March 31.(Official)
The French have evacuated the
ruined village of Malancourt
but firmly hold the highways
leading to Bethincourt and
Esnes.
Washington, March 31 The latest
phase of the submarine warfare
brought out by the sinking of the
Sussex, Is a question of evidence. Un
til this is settled, the president will
not take any steps. He is almost at
the breaking point with Germany,
but does not wish to break off rela
tions without a clear issue.
Others to Consider.
The German contention here is that
the Sussex struck a British mine but
even if this were true, the president
has not yet made up his mind that
the Englishman, Manchester Engi
neer, Eagle Point and other ships met
their fate in like manner. He hesi
tates to believe that Germany has
been playing with him and that her
pledges are not worth considering.
Yet, the conviction is almost forced
upon him that this is the case. The
Baltimore Sun, which is usually re
garded as speakingthe administration
mind, editorially asks why not con
sider circumstantial evidence, and
goes on to cite the circumstances
which go to prove that the Sussex
was torpedoed This undoubtedly is
what is going on in the presidential
mind alsoa careful canvass of the
circumstantial evidence.
Will Act Quickly.
It the evidence is strong enough to
convince the president and his legal
experts that the German pledges are
being broken and were made to be
broken, he will act sharply and swift
ly There is little probability that he
will take the matter to congress until
he has exhausted the search for evi
dence, and, when he does, it will be
with a case made up and an order
ousting Von Bernstorff from the
country.
Today's status of the matter appar
ently is that the issue is more grave
than ever, because the good faith of
Germany is that in question more
than ever before.
GERMANS LOSE 20,000
MEN IN VERDUN BATTLE
London, March 31.The Germans
have lost 20,000 in the renewal of the
Verdun struggle on both banks of the
Meuse. Several battalions have been
destroyed in the attempt to capture
Malancourt French guns on Hill
304 tore such gaps in the lines that
the Germans halted after securing a
foothold in the village.
PRESIDENT AND CABINET
DISCUSS FOREIGN CRISIS
Washington, March 31. The
president and cabinet again discussed
the submarine crisis today. Of the
four boats attacked it is understood
that the Eagle Point is in the ser

sunk while attempting to escape Ger

torpedo destroyed the Sussex the ex

The proposed Bemidji armory can
not be constructed so as to be used

as has been suggested by a Bemidji
weekly paper and several city offi

Information to this effect was re

Title Must Be Clear.
"The title of any armory building
in getting aid must be made abso

Colonel George C. Lambert, secre
tary of the State Armory board, to

Law Ironclad.
"This is law and it's ironclad,"
said Mr. Lambert. "I have not look
ed up the law regarding the build

the armory. Attorney General Smith
would have to rule upon this phase
when formal application has been
presented to me. It appears that un

to built its own city hall and then

GRAND FORKS
FEARS FLOODS
Water of Red River of the North
Rising One-tenth of Foot
an Hour.
Grand Fork*, N. D March 31.
With the Red River of the North
rising at the rate of one-tenth of a
foot an hour and having already pass
ed the six-foot mark, fear of a great
flood in this section of the country is
daily becoming more apparent. Al
ready at certain points the river has
commenced to break from its bed and
unless conditions are relieved, will
undoubtedly submerge a large area
of land in Grand Forks county.
The ice is broken up at this point
and husge cakes are now floating
down stream. Farther down the
Red the ice remains intact and at
Winnipeg it shows no signs of break
ing up as the snow is several feet
deep and the sun has had little effect
upon the thick ice. This indication
points to a dangerous climax in this
district, where the stream, checked
by the ice jam which must evenaually
be the result, will break away from
its bed.
The Red Lake river, which flows
into the Red, has risen but very little
but the waters are now backing up
as far as Crookston, where a big
power dam is located. Above the
dam, according to the city engineer
of Crookston, the ice is still solid and
has shown no signs of breaking up.

COLUMBUS RESIDENTS .k
FEAR ANOTHER RAID
Columbus, N. M., March 31.Two
stories, spread broadcast through Co
lumbus today, caused the tremulous
to fear that Villa is about to make a
second raid on this community. One
story, which grew as it passed from
mouth to mouth, was based on a sug
gestion made by Juan Fayella, a Mex
ican ranch hand employed by Mayor
H. Hoover. Fayella, who is said to
have predicted the raid on this town
March 9, asserted that he believed the
bandit chieftain with a small part of
his band, had doubled on his trail and
was now in the vicinity of Santa Ma
ria in the Gaznan district, about 65
miles south of the border.
AMERICAN ARMY
FLIERS SUPERIOR
Field Headquarters, American
army near Dublan, Mexico, March
31.The experiences of the Amer
ican army fliers in Mexico has made
them superior to any aerial force in
the world in equal numbers, Captain
Foulois today claimed in face of criti
cism. He said that our aviators are
daily encountering conditions unfaced
previously. The mountains of Mex
ico create shifting winds and dan
gerous air pockets. The altitude a
mile above sea gives them only an
other mile of leeway, on account of
the maximum altitude of two miles.

El Paso, March 31.Villa is re

desperately toward the mountains in

of the American flying columns is
hot on his heels.
These are reports from Carranza
forces. The bandit has picked his

mand to make a final dash for cover.
VILLA SLAUGHTERS
CARRANZA GARRISON
San Antonio, -March Sl.-r-After1"
killing every one of the 172 men in
the gariison at Guerrero, Francisco
Villa flew northward Wednesday and
now is. somewhere in the headwaters
of the- Santa Maria river, according
to unofficial information secured by
General Funston. At the head of a
considerable force, Villa was re
ported to be on the San Geronino
ranch, or the Quernado ranch, and
troops of both the United States and
Mexico are believed to be closing in
on him.
Regarded as Correct.
This information was regarded by
General Funston and his staff as
probably correct. If correct, it ap
pears probable that very soon Villa
either will have to face his pursuers
in fight or make another break
through the threatening lines of
troops.
Whether his assault on the garri
son at Guerrero was the same engage
ment reported by Gerneral Pershing
was not known, but it was considered
likely, since the action reported by
General Pershing occurred March 27,
somewhere in that region. Details
of the engagement were not reported.
General Pershing has been advised
of the report as to Villa's location and
it is known that the disposition of his
troops and that of the Mexican gov
ernment are such that Villa cannot
easily escape without a fight. Ameri
can troops are converging from col
umns from the north, and it was in
dicated that a part of them had gone
so far south that they would be able
to join with the Carranza forces in
preventing his escape in that direc
tion. VILLA MURDERS
FIVE MEXICANS
Field Headquarters, American Ex
peditionary Forces, Colonio Dubinin,
Chihuahua, March 31.It has been
learned here that Francisco Villa
nearly lost his life a few days ago on
the Corralitos ranch, a short distance
from this place, where he tortured
and *ut to death five Mexicans. One
of his victims leaped upon him and
was strangling him when the Villista
officers beat him senseless with the
butt- of their guns. Mucio Polanco
was the name of the Mexican who al
most succeeded in ending Villa's ca
reer. The murder of five members of
the Polanco family was said to have
been intended as a warning to other
Mexicans against having dealings
with Americans.
