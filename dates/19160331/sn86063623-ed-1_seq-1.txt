Deserter Arrested Here.
City Marshal C. F. Kinkead
Thursday night arrested Charles
Wilson, who deserted from the
United States Army, while at
Douglas, Arizona, February 12,
1916. Officer Kinkead recog
(nized Wilson from a photograph
and description sent out by the
war department. Wilson is a
pool expert and in watching him
'play, Mr. Kinkead thought he
'recognized in him the counter-
part of a photograph that had
been sent to the police. He ex
amined the files to refresh his
i memory and then confronted
j Yilson with the evidence. Wil
son wasn't long in deciding that
he was the man.
