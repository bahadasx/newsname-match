Absolutely correct but not complete
to irrigate every acre of arid land in
this section is annujly going to waste
down the Boise river îsjhe contention
of settlers and landowners of the
Black Canyon Irrigation district who
are striving to have the district in
cluded in the government project. Fig
ures secured from the reclamation ser
vice covering official observation for
a period of 21 years clearly demons
trated that there is an abundance of
water were read by B. M. Holt at a
rousing meeting of settlers held at
Middleton last Friday.
The settlers at the meeting perfect
ed plans for a permanent organization
electing B. M. Holt of Caldwell; Wil
liam Lemon of Middleton, W. H. Al
bertson of Notus, C. S. Eddy of Par
ma, and Mr. Mason of New Plymouth
a committee to arra'nge plans for
permanent organization.
The committee will meet in Cald
well Friday evening at which time def
inite plans will be adopted. An invi
tation has been extended to citizens
of Nampa. Emmett, New Plymouth
and representatives of the Boise Wa
ter Users', Black Canyon directors and
Caldwell Commercial club.
The figures read by Mr. Holt at the
Middleton meeting followt
"The total average yield or flow in
acre feet of the Boise river for the
years 1895 to 1915 was 2,185,012 a.cre
feet per annum. The average month
ly run off or yield for the same period
was as follows, which for convenience
I have divided into three periods ac
cording to the seasons the water is
used for irrigation:

"The storage capacity of present res
ervoirs is estimated:
Arrowrock 250,000 acre feet
Deer Flat 175,000 acre feet
Total 425,000 acre feet
"The irrigable land now under the
Boise project proper aprpoximately is
144,000 acres. In addition there is
about 60,000 acres being furnished with
partial supply through government ca
nals making a total of 204,000 acres.
"There was a gain in the Boise river
below the Ridenbaugh headgates on
an average during 80 days from Jury
23, 1915 to October 10, 1915 of 461 cu
bic feet due to return flow and seepage
or in other words there was 67% njore
water delivered to the lower ditches
on the river than was available at the
Ridenbaugh headgate. Generally
speaking this return flow and seepage
will take care of the ditches coming
out of the river below the Canyon at
Caldwell and those on the north side
of the river. The return flow will no
doubt increase from year to year and
the amount of land possible ~

water is available during months of
Ji«'- August and September when the
river is low and is in a sense a new
source of supply since it was not
available when the old ditches were
built. ...
"It is generally conceded there is a
surplus of water up to July 1st but it
is also contended there is a shortage
after July 1st. This no doubt was
true in the past but during 1915 the
Arrowrock was completed and <»>,***
acrc feet additional shortage water pro
vided for these, months which with the
Deer Flat makes 425.000 acre («et of
water available for the short months
of July, August and September in au
dition to the ordinary run on ot tne
river and the return flow above men
"As shown above there are 290.551
acre feet on an average in the Boise
river during the months of
gust and September^ To this add the
425,000 «ore feet of storage and w
now have a total of 715.551 acre fee
for those months in addit'on tothe
return flow hgainst 290.551

"The records »how that las year
there were 5.3 acre feet of wa ' er
verted from the river for each acre
irrigated Total the amount of water
available' for the irrigating season as
follows: . t /T7/:io
'A April, May and June — tqii'«1

Arrowrock and Deer Flat.... 425.000
Total, acre feet
i«o
The above figures assume that the
storage reservoirs would be filled dur
ing the winter months and up to the
middle of April. Divide the total by
5.3 we would have water for approxi
mately 350,000 acres outside of the old
ditches now supplied by return flow.
This would indicate that there is plen
ty of water for all thé lands on the
south side and the Black Canyon also,
and on this basis w; would have over
two acre feet available for 350,000
acres of land during July, August and
September.
"It must however be distinctly un
derstood that the above figures are
only rough estimates and that numer
ous conditions will be met in actual
operation which will change the results
materially. The point to be made is
that there is surplus water over and
albove that necessary for the lands at
present under ditches, apparently
enough for all the land tributary to
the Boise river and it behooves the
land owners on the Black Canyon and
all the other water users under the
Boise river to investigate conditions
carefully and agree upon some plan
for the extension of the present boun
daries of the Boise Project so that the
maximum amount of land can be irri
gated and the cost of the project dis
tributed over as much land as possible
thereby reducing the cost per acre.
There is no occasion for one locality
to fight the > other—there is water for
all. Conditions have chaneed and in
the light of present conditions all
should unite together to perfect the
system of distribution and learn to
economize in the use of water, with
the result no doubt, that there will be
less seepage and larger crops."

THIS ACTION DEEMED ADVIS
ABLE BY BOARD OF DIRECT
ORS AT MEETING HELD IN
CALDWELL TUESDAY
LAST,
Temporary Withdrawals Can be Made
Permanent at any Time Feasible
Plan is Shown Department—Rights
of District Fully Conserved by Thxs
Action—Way Kept Open
The directors of the Black Canyon
Irrigation district are preparing to re
quest a temporary withdrawal of the
Carey Act lands within the Black Can
yon district, which will hold the lands
withdrawn for a year after the same
has been approved by the department
Washington.
It is expected that the present Con
gress will appropriate sufficient money
to survey the Black Canyon in its en
tirety and sufficient data be obtained
which will show a plan for the irriga
tion of said lands that will be reason
able in cost and that will be approved
by the department.
Until three years ago the mere rec
ommendation of the State Engineer
was all the Secretary of the Interior
required for these Carey Act segre
gations, because the State was assum
ing the responsibility of reclaiming
the lands, but about three years ago
the department changed its regula
tions and now the department inquires
into the water supply and feasibility
of the construction of dams and reser
voirs before it makes the order grant
ing the permanent segregation.
The General Land Office rejected
the application for permanent segre
gation of these lands on the grounds
that the plan submitted was not feasi
ble. An appeal was taken to the sec
retary and the board requested that
the segregation be not rejected, but
that it be granted a temporary with
drawal to give time for Congress to
appropriate the necessary funds to
make the surveys, looking to the
working out of a feasible plan, and
one that would meet the approval of
the department. The request of the
board of directors was granted by the
department and the directors are now
beginning to prepare the request for
a temporary withdrawal which will
cover the same as was in the former
lists.
As above stated, the board will have
a year after the approval of said lists
within which to make application for
the permanent withdrawal. In case
sufficient data are not obtained within
the year, another temporary with
drawal will be asked, and repeated un
til the funds are available and the
Reclamation Service surveys the en
tire project. Surveys and investiga
tions are still being continued on the
Boise slope, and as soon as completed
the reports on that unit of the Black
Canyon will be made. It is under
stood Senator Borah believes that he
can get the appropriation to complete
the survey of the entire project this
session if it is recommended favorably
bv certain officials in Washington,
and indications are that it will have
such favorable recommendation.

The funeral of the late E. M. Kirk
patrick was held at Parma Tuesday
Memorial services were also held at
the College of Idaho the same day. At
the College Dr. F. E. Springer and
the Rev. H. H. Hayman were the
speakers. Eloquent tribute to the
worth, public spirit and good citizen
ship of Mr. Kirkpatrick were made. At
Parma the services were under the
direction of the Rev. Bruce J. Giffin
The following in brief is the career
of Mr. Kirkpatrick:
E. M. Kirkpatrick was born at Che
noa. 111., Sept. 12, 1870, the son of
George M., and Sarah Wright Kirk
patrick. He had a twin sister, Eu
lela Mary, who died in her fourth
year. His mother died in Illinois in
1899 aged 56 years. He graduated
from Chenoa High school in 1888.
Among his classmates there were his
friend, Lester Silliman, Mr. and Mrs
A. G. Fisk and Mr. F. H. Chapman
He then entered the Illinois Wesleya
university at Bloomington, where he
formed partnerships that were to
have a large influence in his after
life. One of his proudest associations
was his membership in the PhiGam
ma Delta fraternity. Among his fra
ternity brothers were R. A. Russel
J. E. Kerrick, H. C. Baldridge, L. E
Lackland. C. E. Bates and C. B
Hurtt. He graduated with honors in
1893 and for one year after was a
student in the law department of the
university. He decided then upon
business career, becoming a partner
in the grain firm of W. A. Haines &
Co.. in his home town of Chenoa.
June 26, 1895, he was married to
Miss Mary E. Sterry of Pontiac, 111.,
who had been a classmate at the Wes
leyan, and whose brother, John, had
been a member in Mr. Kirkpatrick's
fraternity.
Mr. Kirkoatrick early distinguished
himself in business. Here he became
associated with the Fisk brothers,
who were emploves of th« company.
Hi$ friends Lackland and Bates also
became interested and later the firm
was known as Kirkpatrick Lackland
& Co.
In 1898 with his wife's father. Chris
topher W. Sterry. and C. B. Hurtt he
made his first visit to Idaho. Favor
ably impressed with this section they
undertook to complete the Riverside
canal and to develop some of the farm
land lying under it. This was the be
ginning that led to the almost com
plete transference of the Kirkpatrick
interests to Parmrt He soon indu<-rH
some of his friends to come, among
the first of whom were F. E. Fisk and
F. H. Chapman and their families
well as his father. In November, 1904
Mr. and Mrs. Kirkpatrick todk up their
residence in Parma, simultaneously
with H. C. Baldridge and his family. A
large general merchandise business
was conducted under the name of E
M. Kirkpatrick X. Co.
In* 1903 the Parma State bank was
organized of which he was president
to the day of his death, and he ever
had a justifiable pride in its phenome
nal success.
Roawell Park Venture.
Other interests followed, the one ab
sorbing much of his thought and effort
in recent years being the Roswell
park. Asociated in this huge and dar
ing undertaking with his friend J. H
Lowell, he spared neither effort nor
expense in his effort to make it a sue
cess materially, and ideally. He avow
ed it as his ambition that it should be
an ideal home as well as fruit tract. He
lived to see his dream in large measure
realized.
The burden of his increasing busi
ness responsibilities began to tell on
his strength, and his physicians advis
ed that he relinquish as much of these
as possible. This gave hiin the much
coveted opportunity of travel, which
he always enjoyed. Visits were made
to the Hawaiian islands, to Egypt and
the continent and last of all to Pana
ma, in company with his wife, who was
ever his helpmeet, not only in perfect
home making but in business capacity
and social enjoyment.
Finally he was taken ill with pneu
monia December 10, 1914. On Christ
mas Day he was moved to St. Luke's,
Boise. Convalescing from a desper
ate illness he went to San Diego, Cal.,
for a month, but finding the climate
not suited to his needs he was taken
to the Fottenger sanitorium, Monro
via, Cal. There he seemed to make
Ifcirly consistent progress. At times
it must have been to him quite slow,
for he was kept abed for 261 consecu
tive days. His progress seemed to
warrant the hope of his return to Par
ma to which he looked forward with
eager anticipation. An attack of grip
was too much for him in his weakened
condition and he passed away March
24, 1916, with his devoted wife at his
bedside.
He is survived by his wife, his aged
father. His other relatives in this vi
i-t _ .... ..
' cinity are his aunt, Mrs. S. A. Kirk
patrick, and his cousins, T. H. Kirk
patrick, Chauncey H. Kirkpatrick. H.
Baldridge, Mrs. G. R. Russell, J. C.
Baldridge and Clyde Baldridge.

REBEKAH DISTRICT MEETING
AT MIDDLETON LAST FRIDAY
The annual District Meeting of the
Rebekah lodge was held at Middleton
last Friday and was a very decided
success in every way. Those present
were fortunate to have with them at
both afternoon and evening sessions
Mrs. Augusta K. Johnson of Coeur
d'Alene..president of the State Assem
bly; Mrs. Edna Ross, vice president;
Mrs. Liliian Lanktree of Emmett,
treasurer; Mrs. Frances Crosson of
Boise, secretary; and Past Presidents
Home, Martin and Handy. Also
Grand Secretary Presley F. Home
and Past Grand Master A. E. Gipson,
both of Caldwell, were present. Near
ly a hundred lodge members were in
attendance and every minute of the
afternoon meeting was taken up with
subjects helpful and instructive in
lodge work. Supper was served at
the Murphy restaurant to visiting
members. The evening meeting was
called to order at 7 o'lcock. It being
the regular meeting night of Pansy
Rebekah No. 37 of Middleton, the
routine of business was disposed of
followed by initiation of a candidate
with floor work by the staff of the
Middleton lodge. Rev. L. A. Garri
son was taken through the mysteries
of the -degree and emerged a full
fledged Rebekah member.
Punch and wafers were served
throughout the evening. Caldwell
was selected as the meeting place for
1917.
During the evening Mrs. Lanktree,
one of the most faithful members of
Pansy No. 37, was presented with a
bouquet of carnations and roses as a
token of the love and esteem in which
she is held in the lodge by those who
have been associated with her in this
work for nearly 16 years.
CONTROL OF WATER POWER.
Editor Caldwell Tribune:
Sir—Miners and prospectors note
with some mild concern that several
western newspapers have inadvertent
ly or carelessly, but none the less rep
rehensibly, given space to an article
by Gifford Pinchot entitled "Control
of Water Power"—which article shrills
forth the wailing "voice of one crying
in the wilderness" for help.
That old familiar cry for "help'
perniciously and destructively meddle
in the business of the miners and pros
pectors of the West—issues this time
not from the enemy Bureaus at Wash
ington. büt from the quaintly quiet
and sombre depth of that "rçeck-o-the
woods" yclept, Milford, Pa.
Owing to its heartily welcome ab
sence in the West for some time past,
we really had hoped that wretched
whining voice was welcomely dead
and buried
So we proceed to bury it once more
That ghoulish, uncanny, gruesome
voice screams from the dark of Mil
ford wood:
"I write to ask for your help to de
feat a most serious attack on our pub
lie resources."
"The Shields bill now before the
Senate gives to the power interests
without compensation the use of wa
ter power on navigable streams."
Wow, and wow
Even this ghost with supposed un
canny power of supernatural insight
now flames out again in its old famil
iar style when in the flesh, and just ai
of ye olden time now seeks to pull
the wool over the eyes of the people
with a broad-guaged, all-comprehen
tive falsehood!
The federal government owns no
water power, nor waters from which
power could be created.
The federal government does not
own the waters of the rivers—either
navigable or unnavigable—they belong
to the states.
The U. S. Government owning noth
ing of that kind, of course, has none
to sell and none to give away.
