Paris Hen Roost
Tuesday night Sheriff T. M.
Hagler and Deputy H. E. Butler
placed George Brown, negro, un
der arrest on a charge of having
stolen six hens from the chicken
house of Ewing McVey. Brown
was captured at Son Henry
Brown's negro restaurant and
admitted the theft. '"
The chickens were taken Tues
day night. They were missed and
Mr. McVey soon found them at
Cloys & Nants' establishment,
where they had been sold by
Brown. " ,
..Brown was held under a bond

THREE GUILTY
FRAUD CASES
Thursday afternoon the jury in
the noted Memphis primary elec
tion fraud case found the defend
ants. J. J. Griffin, R. L. Reed and
M. G. Schaedle guilty and recom
mended that they be fined $100
each. It rests with the court to
impose a workhouse or jail sen
tence, which may be from 6 to
12 months.
This is the first occasion in
many years that a conviction has
been obtained in an election fraud
case, and in this instance the
verdict is the direct result of
vigorous prosecution upon the
part of Attorney-General Z.
Newton Estes, of Shelby county.
Gen. Estes had been engaged in
prosecuting the cases for about
a week, and in doing so even
neglected the preparation of his
own defense in the impeachment
proceedings about to be brought
against him at Nashville.
All of the defendants were
accused of frauds in connection
with the first Senatorial primary
last November. Griffin is a
member of the county court of
Shelby county.

Mistrial Results In Case Of
Jim and Sam Love, Held
As Accessories
MURDER IN FIRST DEGREE
JURY VERDICT AS TO BARR
Lone Juror Reported To Have
Held Out Until Eleven
O'clock Saturday
After a lone juror had held out
for a verdict of second degree
murder, according to report, for
many hours, the twelve men who
sat upon the case of Tom Barr,
murderer of Josie Pryor, report
ed a verdict of murder in the
first degree at 1:35 o'clock Satur
day afternoon, and Judge Har
wood at once sentenced Barr to
the penitentiary for life.
The same jury heard the evi
dence against Jim and Sam Love,
also negroes, indicted as acces
sories after the fact, but could
not agree as to tiiese defendant
One report is that the jury stood
seven for conviction and five for
acquittal as to Jim Love and five
for conviction and seven for
acquittal as to Sam Love. It is
generally understood that the
jury stood seven to five as to Jim
Love, but there is a rumor that
only two members of the jury
held out for conviction as to the
other negro.
The trial of the Barr-Love case
took up all of Thursday afternoon
and Friday in circuit court. The
case went to the jury at a late
hour Friday afternoon. When
the jury was called Saturday
morning, the foreman reported
that they could not agree as to
any of the defendants. I
Judge Harwood sent them
back for further deliberation and
at 1:35 o'clock that afternoon
the jury returned the verdict of
murder in the first degree in the
Barr case, but reported that they
were hopelessly hung as to the
Love negroes. The case has
caused a great deal of excite
ment in Paris, owing to the long
search for the Pryor negress'
body, which was finally discover
ed burid on the place of Sam
Love and with a dead hog buried
upon it. The Love negroes de
nied any connection with the
murder or burying of the body.
Barr claimed, on the stand, that
he killed the woman with a plank
and in in self defense, although
he had previously confessed that
he had deliberately planned the
murder. He claimed that he
had no -recollection of having
written the confession.
DICKSON-MARTIN
At the home of the bride at
India, this county, Miss Connie
Dickson and George L. Martin
were united in marriage Wednes

beautiful and accomplished
daughter of Rev. and Mrs. F. E.
Dickson, and the groom a popu
lar young railroad man. The
bride's father performed the
ceremony. They will reside in
West Paris.

EXTRA!
.Probably the first extra edition ever issued by a weekly
newspaper was gotten out by The Parisian on Saturday
afternoon, following the report of the jury in the Barr-Love
murder case.
At 1:35 o'clock Saturday afternoon, the jury reported,
finding Barr guilty of murder in the first degree and bring
ing in a mistrial verdict as to the Love negroes. Judge
Harwood at once sentenced Barr to a life term in the peni
tentiary. Fifteen minutes later, at 1:50 o'clock, The Paris
ian's extra edition, with full particulars of the trial, Barr's
confession, the jury's verdict and the punishment imposed,
was on the streets.
' I ; By this extra edition The Parisian furnished the news of
Barr's conviction and the mistrial verdict as to the Love
negroes to its readers SIX DAYS BEFORE IT COULD BE
READ IN ANY OTHER HENRY COUNTY NEWSPAPER.
In addition to carrying the news of the murder trial, the
extra contained late news in regard to the Mexican situation,
a report of the conviction of the three defendants in the
Memphis ballot fraud case and the latest news from the
Nashville fire.

Mud Roads Bring Citizens To
Realization of Need For
Bond Issue
From every nook and corner
of Henry county come the report
that the people are insisting that
the county court give them an
opportunity to vote upon a
$500,000 bond issue for the
construction of public roads.
The muddy roads that have
lasted throughout the winter
caused many to come to a reali
zation of the possibilities of the
bond issue, and the friends of
the proposition have been active
for several weeks.' " '
Even the opponents of the
plan do not object to the court
submitting the question to the
people for determination, and it
is believed that when the issue
of calling or not calling an elec
tion is put squarely up to the
county court Monday that there
will be little opposition.
So far no voice has been raised
against submitting the question.
The general opinion seems to be
that it would be best for the
people to decide for themselves
as to whether they want good
roads or bad roads, and both
friends and opponents of the
bond issue plan will be glad to
have the issue brought to a vote.
It is being freely predicted that
the court will order an early
election, under an act recently
declared constitutional by the
Supreme Court, in order that the
matter may be fought out before
the voters of the county.
Other important matters that
will come before the court Mon
day will be the question of test
ing the road law to determine
whether or not it was repealed
by an act intended for Robertson
and Haywood counties, and the
question of appropriating funds
for the relief of Grove High
School. A full attendance of the
members of the court . is expect
