WHY?
You save a little because we
deal with the factory direct
and buy for cash. You save a
little by out- selling these in
struments quickly at a reduc-
3d selling expense. You save ä
little through our willingness
to sacrifice some of our p d i j
on an individual sale in order to
make a larger total profit on
twelve sales. You save a little
and get only new instruments
because we do not let pianos
out on trial. You actually save
(through these little amounts
sumed up) ;$19 00 on every

Mrs. Frinlc was a trusting iouj
and rnrely questioned the opinions
of others about matters concerning
which thßv wore supposed to be in
formed. One day she camo home
with a ndv pair of shoes under heT
arm. "Oot them at Bride V' sh
explained, ,kinid they're the best 1
ever bought you."
"What is so very good about
them?" inquired her son, for whom
the shoes wore intended.
"Why, the salesman said that you
could walk farther in thorn than id
tny others without getting tired,
and I snid that you couldn't walk
very far just now on account of
your knee, you know, and he eaid
that he meant farther for the same
distance. So I bought them, and
here they are. Save the string,
please."
She did not notice the smile on
her son's face as he undid the pack

A Sure Investment.
You have never yet made an investment
Where you didn't expect to win,
But you sometime have found to your sorrow
YouVe beautifully taken in.
You may have laid down your good money
For a brick which you f ouAd wasn't gold,
Or met the Bohemian oats swindler,
When you, with your oats, have been sold.
If asked by a friend to play poker,
You'd experience, no doubt quite a shock; .
Then never join hands with a fellow
Who makes money by watering stock.
Now if you would like an investment
In which you can't possibly lose.
