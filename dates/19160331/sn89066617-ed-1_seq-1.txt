ErnestSnider,Owner of South
Cape Restaurant, Ha$ His
Pockets Rifled.
BANDITS FLEE UNDER
COVER OF DARKNESS
Victim First Thought "Stick-np'
Was Joke Police Get No
Trace of Pair.
Two highwaymen, one of whom was
armed with a revolver, last night held
up and robbed Ernest Snider, proprie
tor of the South Cape restaurant at
South Fountain and JIape streets, a
few moments after the latter had
emptied the cash drawer of $18 and
was preparing to close his place for
the night.
The highwayman carrying the gun
marched Snider to the rear part of the
restaurant, where his companion gave
the restauranteur the "once over,"
took the day's cash receipts and then
both fled out the front door, after
commanding Snfder not to watch their
departure.
Snider was unable to tell in what
direction they fled after leaving his
place and a general search in the
southern part of the city last night
proved ineffectual.
The robbery is considered by the
police as one of the boldest that has
been attempted in the Cape in a long
time.
Snider said he was in the front part
of his restaurant behind the counter
about 8:15 o'clock whea the two men
entered. The leader of the two ap
peared to him to be a man about 30
years old. He was of medium height
and weighed about 140 pounds. He
had on 'a dark hat and wore a dark
suit of clothes. His hair, Snider said,
was moderately long and dark.
The second to enter the door was a
boy of about 19 years. He appeared
to weigh about 120 pounds and wore
a gray cap and dark clothes.
They stepped up to the counter
behind which Snider was standing and
the younger man ordered a can of
tobacco. Snider got the tobacco and
placed it on the counter. They then
asked Snider if he could furnish them
with a packet of cigarette papers.
Snider turned around to secure the
packet of papers from a counter
against the wall and when he straight
ened up and turned around to face the
men, he looked down the business end
of a large revolver.
'Tut up your hands!" the younger
man, who held the revolver, ordered.
Snider said he first believed he was
being made the back-stop of a practi
cal joke and did not hasten to comply
with the man's request but placed the
cigarette papers on the counter in
front of him beside the tin of tobacco.
. "Put them up or I'll kill you!" the
man commanded, and he stepped closer
to the counter, bringing the revolver
to within a few inches of Snider's
body.
Snider abruptly gave up the notion
of a practical joke and elevated his
hands.
"Walk back to the kitchen," one of
the men ordered. Snider moved from
behind the counter and made his way
toward the kitchen with the two high- J
waymen pressing closely behind him
in such a manner as to prevent any
chance passerrby who might have
looked into the restaurant through the
window from seeing what was hap
pening on the inside.
In the rear end of the restaurant
the men made Snider face the wall
and the older began rifling his pockets.
Snider said that as nearly as he could
remember he had about $18 in change
which he had removed from the cash
drawer. v,
When all the money was taken from
his pockets the men ordered Snider to
keep facing the wall and remain in
that position. They theri. made their
way back to the door and in another
moment, Snider said, he ( heard the
door slam behind his back, followed
by the noise of their feet in running
. away.
He immediately ran to the door
door and looked up and down on Foun
tain street, but said he could see no
one. He then ran next door to the
Southern hotel, where he telephoned

HIGH WATER DUE
MONDAY; TO HIT
EAST SIDE FARMS
Capt. Jaynes Says Red Tape
Hindered Repair of Gap
in Dike at Gale.
RIVER WILL REACH
26 TO 28-FOOT STAGE
Opening Made To Drain January
Flood Water Never Has
Been Closed.
With the river rising at the rate of
more than a foot every six hours and
a stage of 26 to 28 feet in sight by
Monday, several hundred acres of rich
farming land on the East Side again
are in danger of being inundated by
flood waters, according to announce
ment made last night by Captain Al
Jaynes.
The land on the East Side will be
flooded through a gap left in the dike
about four or five miles south of East
Cape, near Gale. The gap was cut
at the close of the January flood in
order to drain out the water that in
undated the entire East Side.
"On account of so much red tape
that we have to go through before we
can repair the dikes on the East Side,"
Captain Jaynes declared, "we have
just gotten ready to fix that gap. It
is too late now. It would do no good
to start work, because it is probable
that the high water coming would take
the men half way with their work
and wipe out all that they do.
"The gap has stayed there since the
January flood simply because the law
did not permit us to make the neces
sary assessments to pay for the repair
work. We finally -got that done and
just had arranged to have the work
done by Billy Woods, when the high
water strikes.
"It requires a stage of but 24 feet
to go through that dike the way it is
now, and I believe that the stage we
will have by the first part of the
week will put water over a large por
tion of the land. Flood stage of the
river at 30 feet will cause it to back
up in approximately the same manner
as it did in January. j
"If we do not have any water from :
additional rains between here and St
Louis, I believe we shall have a crest
of from 26 to 28 feet by Monday. The
water is in the river and on the way
down. j
"The situation in the Ohio river,
however, complicates the flood here;
for the Ohio is coming up fast and
that flood will require at least five
days to empty out. We will have to
wait and see what the two together
do here at the Cape."
Captain Jaynes declared that a 6:30
o'clock yesterday morning when he
went to work, the river was around 20
feet on the stage, and at 1 o'clock in
the afternoon it had come up 1.3 feet.
Last night it had continued to rise
at approximately the same rate. The
river likewise was filled with ice.
Captain Jaynes owns considerable
of the farming land that is endanger
ed by the. water on the East Side, and
other Cape Girardeauans have large
holdings there.
The Captain last night expressed as
his opinion that the water would
remain on the fields but a short time
and would not result in great damage.
Most of the acreage is used for corn
raising and no crop has been put in
at this time. Alfalfa fields would not
suffer greatly either, he said.

MRS. CAHILL REGAINS
HER LOST VOICE
Though Silent in Tete-a-Tete,
Could Make Self Heard
Over Telephone.
Mrs. G. E. Cahill, who lost her voice
completely several days ago while in
the midst of an animated conversation
at a party, is regaining her power of
speech and yesterday was able to talk
with a voice of almost her natural and
normal tone.
Mrs. Cahill, who is the wife of Man
ager Cahill of the express company,
has been able- to make people hear
her almost perfectly over the tele
phone, although in her presence she
has been forced to speak in a whisper
audible only within a circle of a few
feet radius from her.
It is believed by the physicians who
attended Mrs. Cahill that she suffered
a unique case of temporary paralysis
of the vocal cords in her throat. The
muscles refused to function properly
and she has lived through a period
during which the muscles have been
allowed to return to their natural
condition.
Mrs. Cahill ha3 been employed as a
bookkeeper and secretary at the offices
of the Meyer-Albert wholesale grocery
and she and her husband reside at 45
South Spanish street.
Several days ago while attending a
party made up of women members of
her church, she was seized with the
attack. She had suffered with a severe
cold for several days before.
The disappearance of her voice was
complete. Mrs. Cahill first believed it
was due to an extremely bad case of
"frog in the throat" as a consequence
of her cold. The next day her speaker
did not come back and she considei'ed
a study of the sign language.
A few days after she first lost her
ability to hold conversation she man
aged to articulate a whisper. It would
carry only a few feet in a room but
was translated into very presentable
speech over the telephone.
She returned to her work and at
the offices of the grocery company her
whispered conversation has elicited
stentorian tones by contrast from her
auditors whose extra lung power inti
mated a paralysis of her hearing as
well.
STORKvIS RESPONSIBLE FOR
NEW YORK CENTRAL WRECK
Cleveland, O., March 29. A sleepy
tower man is to blame for the Am
herst wreck, the general superinten
dent of the New York Central decided
late today. It is said that the tower
man's wife gave birth to a child Sun
day night and that the tower man had
been without sleep most of the time.
Herbert Hess, engineer of the sec
ond section of No. 86, states that he
did not see the red signal before he
struck the first section. But imme
diately on freeing himself from his
cab, after the crash, he walked back.
The red light, Hess said, was set
against him.
A. H. Emst, the Amherst tower
man, said the .wreck was due to . a
hitch in the block signal system, either
a cross connection or a broken circuit.
"There had been trouble with the
signals two weeks ago" said Ernst.
"I was not asleep and I had my sig
nals straight. The fault is with the
mechanism, if Engineer Hess saw the
signal clear, as he says. Track repairs
made a. few das ago may have im
paired the signal mechanism."

Asks for a Raise and Gets a
Mysterous Letter, Which
Proves to Him He Doesn't
Work One day in the Year.
William Blakemore, the tobacco
man, best known as "Bill, the Tuxedo
kkl," is wondering whether, or not he
is to be given a raise by the American
Tobbacco Company, in accord with a
promise made several months ago.
In 1916 he added several Southeast
Missouri counties to the territory
which be covers, a id the sales he
made for the twelve months exceeded
the best record his company ever
made.
He asked for a raise and was as
sured that it would soon be granted,
but a few days arju; received a let
ter which he fears spells disaster for
him. The letter had to do with a clerk
who made a request for a " boost in
salary. The story follows:
"A Jewish clerk asked his employer
for an increase in salary. The em
ployer answered:
" 'You admit there are only 363 days
in a year. You work only 8 hours a
day, therefore there are 16 hours a
day in which you do. not work. This
amounts to 244 days a year, leaving
121 days. There are 52 Sundays,
leaving 69 days. You work only half
a day on Saturday, amounting to 26
days, leaving 43 days.
"'You take 1 houreach day for
lunch,, making 16 days, leaving 27.
You take two weeks vacation with pay,
amounting to 14 days, leaving 13 days.
There are 12 legal holidays, leaving 1
day, and that day being Jewish Day
of Atonement, you do not come to
work." '
After reading the communication he
crossed his fingers and expectorated
through his teeth, hoping that any
"curse" that may have been -visited
upon him would be dispelled.

NEGRO "FINDS" EGGS
AND LOSES HIS JOB
Reveals "Nest" to Art Wielpuetz
Who Finds Case of 30
Dozen in Coal Bin.
Rudi Williams, -well-known negro
porter, yesterday "discovered" such a
profitable hen's nest at the Wielpuetz
bakery that it caused him to lose his
position as porter at the bakery in
Haarig.
Williams showed Art Wielpuetz a
hen's nest behind a bale of a hay in
the Wielpuetz barn that produced 10
dozen eggs. Williams had appropri
ated the product of the remarkable
nest to hi.s own use, and Wielpuetz
determined that such a nest well could
devote its product to the bake shop
where eggs are in demand, and
promptly allowed Williams to look for
another position.
The nest was turned up yesterday
morning when Wielpuetz saw Wil
liams walk through the bakery with a
large basket on his arm".
"What have you got there, Rudi?"
Wielpuetz inquired.
"Old clothes," Williams replied.
"I forgot a shirt, guess I better go
back and . fetch it." He forthwith
made his way to the barn, where he
had fitted out a janitor and porter's
office.
Wielpuetz followed him and insisted
that he be allowed to see the clothes
and anything else that might be con
tained in the basket. Despite Wil
liams' exposure of the clothing piled
in at the top, Wielpuetz rummaged
through and uncovered the eggs.
They counted out 10 dozen.
"Where did you get these, Rudi?"
"Waal, sah, ah foun' them in nestes
aroun' hyere," the janitor remarked.
"Show me the nests," Wielpuetz ex
claimed. Williams led him to 'the loft and
after kicking aside a bale of hay he
declared that the space in behind had
produced the 10 dozen eggs. Wil
puetz made a thorough examination
of the premises in search of other
nests and found in one of the coal bins
at the bakery a 30-dozen case of e
that had but 10 dozen removed and
which had been checked missing in the
commissariat.

London, March 20. The German army under the Crown Prince made
further gains in their advance on the Verdun-Pr.ris Railway. This was ad
mitted by the statement issued by the French War Office at midnight.
The Germans stormed the French positions north of Malancourt on a
front of one mile and a quarter, penetrating the line to a depth of several
hundred feet. This was the greatest gain of the week in the drive of the
Crown Prince's army. The German fire in the Malancourt region started
early in the day and wiped out a long line of wire entanglements and
trenches.
Special Dispatch to The Tribune.
Berlin (via London), March 29.
French positions north of Malancourt
several lines deep along a front of
more than 2000 yards have been
stormed by German troops, the head
quarters staff announced today.
The statement says:
"Eastern front: The Russians did
not repeat their attacks in the north
ern sectors yesterday, but continued
during the day and night their fruit
less efforts south of Xarocz Lake. On
seven occasions our troops repulsed
the enemy, sometimes at the point of
bayonets.
"Western front: South of St. Eloi
one of the mine craters occupied by
the British was wrested from them as
a result of a hand-grenade engage
ment. "On the left bank of the Meuse our
troops with little loss to themselves
stormed French positions north of
Malancourt over a front of about 2000
meters. They also penetrated into the
northwestern portion of Malancourt.
"The French left in our hands 12
officers and 486 unwounded men, one
cannon and four machine guns."
Malancourt lies about lO'a miles
northwest of Verdun and some two
miles northeast of the southern tip of
the Avoqourt Wood, into which the
Germans pushed in their recent great
drive west of the Meuse. The French
lines here formed a broad sallient, ex
posed to attack from either flank and
French tenure of the position had not
been considered secure by many mili
tary observers
Paris reports last night stated that
the Germans opened a .heavy attack
but that it had been repulsed, and that
the French forces had won a success
against the Germans in the Avocourt
Wood.

U. .

After being changed in accordance
with the desires of France, the British
draft of the reply was again sub
mitted to the French Cabinet and did
not prove wholly satisfactory, one
point in particular leading to some
disagreement.
However, it is believed a satisfac
tory adjustment of the views of th
two nations has been reached and that
the note is now complete.
It is known now that no concession
leading to declaration of an actual
blockade is made in the note, which
reiterates the principles set forth in
orders in council arid defends their
application. In regard to the actual
administration of these orders, how--ever,
some moderations are granted.
These concessions are believed to be
the result of suggestions made by the
French government.
The note will be signed only by
Foreign Secretary Grey, but a para

French government was consulted be

The permission for use of the rail
road is not granted in a military
sense and does not cover the move
ment of troops for which the Ameri
can army has not asked . It will, how
ever, enable Gen. Pershing's force to
get supplies in abundance in a country
where motor truck trains cannot carry
them and will thus aid immeasureably
in the pursuit of the Villa bandits.
Whether the management of 'the
railroad will move the army supplies
on special schedules is not known.

transportation might delay the arrival '
of consignments at Casas Grandes, it
is feared. . .
