Golden Valley's Leading Newspaper By Virtue of Circulation and Prestige
Golden IDalliey Chronic
A Newspaper that Causes Comment in a Town that is
G. V. Superior
to Montana
As illustreling the desirability
of Golden Valley lands over the
sections of the state and Montana,
the following interesting fact came
to the attention of the Chronicle
editor this week.
During the past ten years, a
prominent eastern land company
disposed of nearly 40,000 acres
of fertile Gohjfn Valley soil to
homeseekers and investors in real
eri iate. Since then they have large'
ly disposed of their real estate in
terests here, gaining control of a
large area near the Bitter Root
Valley in Montana, which they
are parceling out to homeseekers.
Here a singular difficulty present
ted itself. Such a reputation had
the Golden Valley attained that
•bhe firm experienced considerable
difficulty in persuading home
seekers to go further west after
they had once glimpsed the
Golden Valley, and as a conse
quence, considerable difficulty is
being experienced in disposing of
the werilern lands to people from
the east who must pass through
here in order to look them over.
A number of these people
com,e from German settlements in
Minnesota. In one particular in
stance, they are closely associated
with a wortk.,' German pastor, a
Rev. Woolf. who is endeavoring
to place his people in a newer sec
tion of the agricultural west where
they may derive the advantages
of low priced lands with as high
grade crops as are raised in Min
nesota. Rev. Woolf refuses ab
solutely to consider a migration
of his flock to any other s-ection
of the country but the Golden
Vailley.
Recently, the real estate firm
alluded to gained control of 20,
000 acres of agricultural land ly
ing between Beach and Carlyle.
This is a very fertile area, and was
controlled, so we understand by
the Beaver Valley Land Com
pany, who were in no hurry to
colonize the district, realizing its
ultimate value. The new owners
are taking active steps toward
closing it out this year to actual
sriltlers only, which will give a big
imipetus to the agricultural prog
ress and advancement not alone
of that locality, but to
Valley as a whole.
the entire
This is a condition of affairs
in which every ci/'izen of the Gold
en Valley may take worthy pride,
and shows to what an extent this
country is advertised to eastern
homeseekers. Surely, with this
appreciation shown abroad, our
local people will not go wrong by
taking a more vital interest in the

Three Drown in
Missouri Floods
Bismarck, N. D. March 28
Unprecedented flood conditions
in the Missouri river and over the
entire Missouri slope district have
taken a toll of three lives and
completedly blocked all traffic in
this district of the Northern Paci
fic lime.
With a storm in progress to
right, heavy rain and snow fall
ing, conditionsarelikely i'o become
worse. Today's fatalities include
the following:
John Will of Center, drowned in
square Creek Fred Laute of
Braddock, drowned in drainage
canal James Quinzer of Braddock
drowned in drainage canal.
Young Will and his mother
were precipitated into the stream.
Mrs. Will being unable to save
her boy. His body has not been
recovered.
Laute and Quinzer were drown
ed while driving in a buggy, go
ing into what they thought was a
bridge, only to be precipatated
into a drainage canal and both
were killed.
Main line, traffic on the North
em Pacific was abandoned when
bridges at Alrr.ont and Curlew
were washed out by the Knife
River. On the Mandan to Golden
Valley line, bridges near Hazen
and Golden Valley were swept
away, while on the Mandan to
jMott line, bridges near Schmidt
were carried out and many
miles of track inundated by the
(Cannon Ball river.
Big ice gorges, formed at Wash
burn, Sanirh and Williston, in the
main channel of the Missouri
river, hold firm tonight, and resi
dents along the river are in many
rases in peril. The lower portion
of Mandan is flooded.
Work towards the erection of
Valley City's new postoffice has
comJmenced by the removal of the
buildings that encumber lihe build

3 CHILDREN BURN TO

Three children were burned to
death in their home in the absence
of their parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Edward Carson, living on the Min-
residence several hours before

of the house.
A I 2-year-old girl, the daugh

the three babies, the oldest being
only six years old, instead of res
cuing the children, ran to her home
to give the alarm. When she re
turned with rescuers the building
was entirely in flames and tthe
three children had been burned to
death.

yield him a handsome profit.
The enterprising farmer referr
ed to is Edward Summers, who
lives five miles northwest of
Beach. We don't know juat1 how
long he held his wheat, but we
will venture to state that he has
neli'ed a handsome profit from it
also over and above what he
would have obtained if he had
hauled it from the elevator to the
machine.
It is, of course, it,he irony of
circumstances that all farmers
can't parallel Mr. Summers' per

have the money at once Ito liqui

cases, however, if the local bank

Because of the heavy floods
•near Mandan and Bismarck, the
train service on the Northern Pa
cific has been considerably disor
ganized this wsek, in spite of the
heroic efforts of the company to
\keep the trains running. So much
snow has fallen in the central and
northern parts of the stabe that
the sudden thaw caused all the
rivers and streams to overflow
ytheir banks, in many instances the
water being several males wide.
Bridges were washed out and the
road bed washed away, in sever
al cases the rails and ties being
suspended in the air after the
fashion of a suspension bridge.
Tuesday the through passenger
trains were sent around on the
Great Northern, which left Beach
w'llhout mail service for about
thirty-six hcurs. Since then train
service has been resumed, though
all west bound trains have been
from one to six hours late on ac
count of the laborious process of
installing temporary bridges amd
'he spongy nature of the roadbed.
The comoany deserves consider*
able credit for the manner in
which they met the exigency.
