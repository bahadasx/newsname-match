VOLUME XII
GLASGOW, VALLEY COUNTY, MONTANA, MARCH 31, 1916.
NUMBER 48.
BUILDING BILL
MAY BEPASSED
Federal Building Appropriation
Taken Up in Congress.
PROSPECTS FAVORABLE
Montana Delegation Working to Get
Measure Through—More Data
is Furnished.
That the bill asking for an appro
priation of $100,000 for the purchase
of a site and erection of a federal
building in Glasgow is being serious
ly considered in Washington is evid
enced by letters received recently
from Congressman Stout and Sena
tor Walsh.
Data was sent to the Montana del
egation some time ago, regarding the
necessity and economy of the erec
tion of a federal building here and
what action is being taken in the
matter is shown from the fact that
more information is desired by the
committee.
In a letter to L. P. Evans of this
city Congressman Stout states that
"all the data available has already
been submitted to the committee and
every effort will be made to bring
out the realization of our desires in
the premises."
Senator Walsh writes:
Hon. L. P. Evans
Glasgow, Montana.
Dear Sir:—I am in receipt of your
esteemed favor relating to a federal
building at Glasgow. Will you have
the kindness to write me at length
about this matter, setting out the
amount of business done at the post
office and at the land office, with
such other facts as may have a prop
er bearing upon the advisability of
locating at your city, a public build
ing. I am disposed to believe that
favorable -consideration might be
given to the project. Very truly
yours,
T. J. WALSH.
Reports on the business done at the
postoffice and land office have been
prepared by Postmaster Herring
and Receiver E. C. Hargadine.
The report of the postoffice shows
the receipts by years since 1909:
Year Ending
December 31, 1909 $ 6,105.80
December 31, 1910 8,532.98
December 31, 1911 7,983.87
December 31, 1912 9,307.88
December 31, 1913 12,228.72
December 31, 1914 14,468.22
December 31, 1915 13,832.11
The decrease for the year ending
December 31, 1915, was due to the
fact that so many outlying post of
fices were established and supplied
direct from the department, thereby
taking the revenue from this office.
The Glasgow office is the distribut
ing point for fifteen outlying offices
and the mail to and from these of
fices is handled through here.
At the present rate of increase
this office will gain back more than
the deficit of last year, by the end of
December 31, 1916.
- The report of the land office shows
that during 1915 the local office is
sued 1725 final certificates; that
there were 12 rejected proofs not ap
pealed; 16 rejected proofs appealed,
and 10 proofs rejected and withdrawn.
Five thousand, six hundred and
ten appl : cations for land were pre
sented and $303,916.20 was paid in,
of which $267,962.81 was earned. The
difference was repaid to those whose
applications were rejected. The ex
penses of running the office during
the year was $14,020.62, which in
cludes the salaries of clerks, rental,
including heat and janitor service,
new furniture, registration, stamps,
^tc.
In going over the earnings for the
last four years it was found that they
would amount to approximately $700,
000 for that length of time. The
last two years the earnings have gone
over the $250,000 mark and there is
every indication that this will con
tinue for some time to come, as there
are thousands of homesteaders in this
district who have not yet made final
proof.
NEW BUILDING STARTED
The excavating for the new one
story brick store building which is
to be constructed by the First Na
tional bank between their building
and the Emporium on Front street,
began yesterday morning. Liegland
and Kleppe have the contract for the
erection of the building.
The building will have a frontage
.of 30 feet and will be 70 feet deep,
and when completed will be used for
store purposes..
The large room on the second floor
of the First National bank building
is also being remodeled. The U. S.
Land Office will occupy this space
about the first of June, when they
will move from their old quarters in
the Milk River Valley bank building.

INTERESTING TALK
ON IRRIGATION
I. D. O'Donnell Advises Farmers
How to Get Best Results.
Irrigation on the farm and how it
makes for better results was very
clearly demonstrated in the address
given by Hon. I. D. O'Donnell, Super
visor of Irrigation of all U. S. Re
clamation Projects, to the fanners at
the Gibson Opera house last Friday
afternoon. The attendance was not
as large as was expected and this is
explained by the high water along
the Milk river preventing many who
wished to hear Mr. O'Donnell from
getting into town.
Mr. O'Donnell, in his talk, made the
assertion that the farmer is the
shrewdest man in the world. In fact,
that he had to be in order that he
might succeed in his business. That
there was more diversified interests
in farming than in any other busi
ness which brought the farmer into
many different lines of endeavor, if he
expected to utilize every part of the
farm product. He took tip from this
point how irrigation made it possible
for a farmer to broaden out his work
make one part care for another and
thus make a self-sustaining whole of
the entire place.
Diversity and rotation of crops was
one of the points which Mr. O'Don
nell dwelt upon very strongly. His
remarks applied to dry farming as
well as to irrigated farming. The ir
rigator might have an opportunity of
wider range of rotation than the one
who did not irrigate but the same
method can be applied with very good
results. It tends to keep the soil in
a higher state of cultivation and the
returns are correspondingly greater.
Sugar beet growing in the irrigated
districts was taken up by Mr. O'Don
nell and he stated his opinion to be
that the Milk River valley can grow
them profitably.
This is one of the crops which he
shows, can be grown in rotation with
others, such as grain, alfalfa or some
tilling crop. The rotation of sugar
beets, grain and alfalfa, he stated,
is sure to bring big profits to the
farmer. It provides for many by
products, and the utilization of what
would otherwise be wasted, in keeping
up a high farming standard.
"Feeding livestock," said Mr. O'
Donnell," is one of the natural re
sults of the rotating of crops as out
lined. If sugar beets are grown the
tops, with alfalfa is the greatest
feeding combination obtainable! It
puts stock in excellent condition for
the market.
This is but a part of the many val
uable points brought home to the
farmer and those who heard Mr. O'
Donnell expressed having received
many good points which they can use
this year in their work.
At seven o'clock the Commercial
club held an informal luncheon at the
Coleman hotel where Mr. O'Donnell
gave a short talk upon the benefits a
city received from having a sugar
beet factory. He outlined the invest
ment represented, the size of the pay
roll and the amount of cash paid out
to farmers every fall showing a tre
mendous amount of money. Mr. O'
Donnell has been raising sugar beets
ever since the factory in Billings
started and he stated that he has
made good money every year. His
average in sugar beets has been 200
acres anually.

CAMPAIGN TO
. BEAUTIFY CITY
Commercial Club Backs Plan to
Improve Glasgow.
PRIZES TO BE OFFERED
Co-operation of Property Owner»
and School Children Urged to
Make it a Success.
A "City P.cautiful" campaign will
be inaugurated the first of April by
the Glasgo-v Commercial club ander
a competitive plan that will, if proper
ly entered into by the householders
and school children make every va
cant lot in the city blossom forth as
a garden and every home take on add
ed beauty.
The plan to make Glasgow a "City
Beautiful" has been under consider
ation by the club since early last win
ter and the preliminary work has
pftictically been completed. The ne
cessity of securing vegetable and
flower seeds sufficient to carry on the
work made it a difficult matter to
know just how extensive the move
ment might be advanced. There is
assurance of the Club now having suf
ficient of both kinds to permit of a
very interesting and lively participa
tion by the people of Glasgow in mak
ing the city a beauty spot.
Secretary S. C. Moore has been in,
communication with the Montana
Senators and Congressman in an of
fort to secure a quantity of seeds,
from the Agricultural, Department.
Each of them have sent whatever seed
could be spared from their allotments.
Senator H. L. Meyers took exception
al interest in the plans of the Club
and furnished a very large number
of packages of seed out of his own
quota. He also took up the matter
. , , .... .
with the Secretary of Agnculure and
procured for the Club a sufficient
additional amount of vegetable and
flower seeds to make it possible to
open the campaign at this time.
The plans outlined for conducting
the "City Beautiful" campaign will bo
outlined and made public within
short time. Blanks will be provided
upon which entries may be made by
those wishing to participate. It isj
hundred vegetable and flower beds will
be under cultivation during the sum
mer.
The plans contemplate dividing the
entries into three classes, one for
children, one for grown ups who do
their own work and one for those who
will employ some one to attend the
garden for them. There will be ap
propriate prizes offered to be award
by a judging committee composed of
persons who will not know the own
ers of any of the gardens. It will be
conducted upon its merits and every
vegetable plot or flower bed will be
credited according to the rules gover
ning the contest.
Details of the plan have been ob
. . , . ^ ^ _ ,
tained from Davenport, Iowa, where
. «pu.. « '
the campaign for a "City Beautiful
was first inaugurated in 1913, and
has been continued each year with
great success. Additional features
are added each year which, if the
movement in Glasgow is
sucessful
this year, will be incorporated into the
plans- here.
Mayor Kent and the City Council
are co-operating in the movement and
have made the start by selecting a
clean up day. This will be on April
15th and every person in town ought
to put in that day cleaning the refuse,
ashes and every other unsightly ob
ject from the premises
Announcement will be made
next
week in the papers telling how to
participate in thf "City «-»«fnl»
Beautiful
contest and the Commercial Club
hopes every one will join in and make
it a success.
