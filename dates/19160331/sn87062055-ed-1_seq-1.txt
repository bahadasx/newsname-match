LESS THIN 300,000 ACRES
FOREST BURNED IN 1915
Washington, March 27th. Forest
fires burned over not quite 300,000
acres of National "Forest land in 1915,
according to official reports just com
pleted, or at the rate of less than two
acres per thousand acres of forest.
Out of a total of 6,800 fires, 5 per cent
did damage to the amount og $100 or
more.
The timber loss was 156,000,000
board feet, valued at $190,000.00. Al
though the season was regarded as
one of unusual exposure, owing to de
layed fall rains, the loss was mate
rially below the nverage of the last
five years. Over 87 per cent of this
loss occurred in the States of Oregon,
Washington, and Idaho, while more
than 72 per cent was in Oregon alone.
Besides the timber loss, fires de
stroyed reproduction, or young tree
growjth, of an estimated valuo of
$160,000, and $3000 worth of forage.
The loss per fire in 1915 was $60.41,
which is less than the average. The
cost of fighting each fire was also less
than the average.
Lightning figures as the chief cause
of forest fires in 1915, as it does in
the average venr. Twentv-cight ner
cent of the fires were due to this
cause. Campers caused 18 per cent,
which is 2 per cent higher than the
average. Eleven per cent were caused
by brush burning. Nearly 11 per cent
were of incendiary origin. Railroads
were responsible for nearly 9 per cent
of the fires in 1915, as against 14 per
cent due to this cause in the average
year. The causes of over 15 per cent
were unknown. Lumbering operations
caused less than 3 per cent.
In the National Forests of Arizona
and New Mexico, 417 fires occurred,
of which 89 Der cent were extinguished
before they had burned over ten acres.
Kolb Bros. Pictures Please
Kolb Bros, famous pictures of their
daring trip through the deadly rapids
of the Colorado river as it batters its
way through the Grand Canyon to the
Gulf of Mexico, at the Empress thea
tre Monday afternoon and evening,
given for the benefit of the Elks new
home, drew a good house at the mati
nee and a full house in the evening.
It was all home pictures, with a
lecture by one of the famous brothers.
Ed Kolb, who took the perilous trip
down the river, and who is a member
of Flagstaff Lodge No. 499, B. P. O
E. The pictures were given free by
Kolb Brothers as was the theatre for
the evening's entertainment by Mana
ger J. J. Costigan.
Those who viewed the pictures were
delighted with the evening's enter
tainment, especially so were those who
have made their way down into the
canyon The roping of a mountain
sheep on one of the high pinacles on
a dangerous ledge, by a cowpuncher,
was a startling novelty In the way of
a spectacular movie. The Elks arc
exceedingly grateful to the Kolb Bros,
for their generosity as well as that of
Manager Costigan.
Prarie Dogs Mainly Exterminated
A. S. Worthington came up from
the Verde Monday. Mr. Worthington
says that he believes that at least
nine-tenths of the prairie dogs in this
section of the country were drowned
during the past winter. The ground
was not frozen when the big snows
came and it melted filling their holes
with water, either driving them out
to freeze or drown.
"So far this spring I have seen but
two or three dogs where there were
hundreds usually seen at this season
of the year." Mr. Worthington's state
ment was made in reference to the
country south of Flagstaff. So far we
have not heard any one express them
selves relative to the northern sec
tion, though it would seem the same
condition would prevail there.
Oatman's White Slave Case
Four petty Los Angeles girls,
Alice Keesee, Mildred Kling, Alice
Buscr and Carrie Kalfa, told in the
federal court of having been promised
diamonds, automobiles and plenty of
money if they would leave Los An
geles and go to the "49 camp" dance
hall in Oatman. Their testimony was
given during the trial of Walter
Arndt on a charge of white slavery.
Bridge Inspector Seriously Injured
C. D. Ellis, a Santa Fe bridge in
spector was struck by No. 22 last Fri
day afternoon six miles east of Wins
low, while going over the road with
his speeder and seriously if not fatally
injured by the accident Ellis was the
man who piloted the famous walker,
Edward Payson Weston from Selig
man to Marion, Ohio, on his famous
walk across the continent about three
years ago.
WILL ATTEMPT TO PISS
LOCIL OPTION LAW
The second meeting of the so-called
"initiation committee" appointed at
the first meeting of those interested
in the repeal or modification of the
prohibition law, was held in Phoenix
last week. There was an attendance
of 75, every countv being represented.
Just what happened was not made
public hut it was reported that a
form of bill substituting local option
for prohibition wns ordered drafted.
It is also reported that it wns made
known at the meeting that no help
need be exnected this vear from the
great brewing and distilling interests
which will be drawn upon for sinews
of war in the titanic struegle which
will take nlace in California between
the "wets" and the "drvs."
It is said that if the auestion of lo
cal option were submitted alone the
"wets" would not have stronr hone
that it would carry. But it is thought
that the temperance federation will
attempt to tighten the grip of prohibi
tion on the state bv a nrovision de
clarinc specifically against the im
nortation of intoxtVatinf liouor for
"personal use." That it is assumed,
would not nearly carrv this vear and
in, the confusion that would result
from its submission, there miVht be
n chance, the "wets" think, thnt a
local option proposition might be
adopted.

ADJUTANT GENERAL
IS SEVERELY CRITICISED
That the Arizona National Guard is
a hotbed of politics and extremely
inefficient therefore, this state being
due to continue political intrigues on
the part of Col. Charles W. Harris,
adjutant general; that he is incom
petent from a general viewpoint and
that recent moves have been in prep
aration for the distribution of patron
age, upon the expected passage of the
Hay bill, was the information which
came from reliable sources recently.
When interviewed on the subject
prominent officers connected with the
guard laid the blame for the whole
trouble at the feet of Col. Harris. It
is their contention that Harris has
used the guard as a means to play
politics and advance certain schemes
calculated to benefit both himself and
Governor Hunt, in fact, the direct
charge of incompetence was flung at
him.
It has been known for some time
that the war department has been
urging the removal of Harris. Last
December Assistant Secretary of War
Breckenridge, in a letter to Governor
Hunt, stated emphatically that the re
tention of Harris was not for the
benefit of the guard and that Harris'
attitude towards the war department
was one of "poorly veiled hostility."
He also said that Harris had opposed
every rule and regulation of the de
partment designed to make the guard
efficient for national service, in case
of need, instead of state service. Sec
retary of War Garrison wrote Gov
ernor Hunt that "Harris is inefficient
from a federal viewpoint."
INDICTMENT OF SLIPT.
Superintendent Walter Runke, as
good measure for his faithful service
and endeavor to comply with the
edicts of the Indian Department, was
indicted by the federal grand jury at
Prescott along with Ed Nash, D. M.
Robinson and Ashley Wilson, charged
with the killing of the renegade In
dian Taddy Tin north of Tuba last
February. Each of them were placed
under $5,000 bounds. Supt. Runke
though receiving the surprise of his
life at the action of the grand jury
succeeded in getting bonds, the other
three men were in jail at last accounts
awaiting trial.
Had a white officer attempted to
arrest a white man and he had made
the same effort to kill them and was
killed in resisting arrest for any
cause, there would have been but little
excitement over the affair, but in this
instant, where Supt. Runke was en
deavoring to do his duty as instructed,
a renegade Indian was killed. That
seemed to make a great difference, at
least to those behind the proposition,
whatever may have been their object.
The three men, Nash, Robinson and
Wilson who were sent to make the
arrest, were advised to waive exami
nation before the U. S. commissioner
here, they did so and put up a bond.
PISSING OF IN EARNEST
PATRIDTWORTH OF NOTE
The news reaches Winslow that Mr.
John Donahue, one of our pioneer set
tlers, passed away at the home of his
daughter, Mrs. Mamie Ellison, at San
Bernardino, March 13th, and body was
laid to rest in the cemetery at Los
Angeles. For thirty years Mr. Dona
hue conducted a blacksmith shop here
and was known far and wide both for
his skill as a mechanic and for his
loyalty and devotion to his country
and its flag. He erected a pole in
front of his shop, and every legal
holiday the American flag was un
furled to the breezes that the world
might know that to John Donahue its
stars and stripes stood for liberty, the
home, and for God. His failing health
several months ago made it necessary
that ho go to the home of his daughter
in California, where he could receive
her loving care, and his only worry
was that the flag would not .be raised
in front of his shop during his ab
sence. He finally wrote to Mayor BIy
asking him to attend to this duty, and
when he received the mayor's reply
that the flag was being raised on the
stated days his mind was at rest.
Mr. Donahue was 74 years of age at
the time of his death. Winslow Mail.
Thousands Acres State Land Leased
Thousands of acres of grazing
land have been leased of the
state during the month along the
Cataract Canyon to the National for
est line. Practically all the land
vailablc to lease has been taken by
sheep and cattlemen in that section of
the country as a protection against
over crowding the range. It will
make a considerable annual revenue
for the state which has been lost
heretofore.
COMPANY I MOVES INTO
NEW HEADQUARTERS
Company I now has larger and bet
ter quarters for their growing com
pany and equipment Captain Robison
has leased the old Catholic church
building on Branncn avenue and
moved into it this week. The floor
space will give the boys about twice
as much room, with officers rooms and
room for lockers. The grounds outside
can be used for parades aud other
purposes.
It is understood that the old G. A.
R. building has been leased for the
new democratic paper.
State Health Officers Will
Hold State Meeting
' Elaborate preparations are being
made by the Maricopa County Medi
cal Association for the entertainment
of the 25th annual session of the
State Association which convenes in
Phoenix.
On Monday, April 24th, the Health
Officers of the state will hold their
meeting. Tuesday will be given over
to the Arizona Society for the Study
and Prevention of Tuberculosis. Wed
nesday and Thursday will be devoted
to the. scientific program. The even
incrs will be well taken in social enter-
, tainment with special reference to the
visiting ladiee.
RUNK
E BY FEDERAL
ADDS INSULT TO INJURY
It was reported that the U. S. attor
ney advised them to do so.
What charge can be made against
Runke is a mystery to every one in
this section of the country
He was instructed by the Indian
Department, his course was clear to
him and he placed his life in jeopardy
in carrying out instruction, and by a
mere chance of missing his road
would have probably been waylaid and
killed.
For this loyal service he is sub
jected to the ignominy of being in
dicted and placed under $5,000 bonds
awaiting trial.
Whoever is behind such a scheme,
plot or whatever you may call it, is
hardly fit to be classed among white
folks and should be compelled to live
with the class to which Taddy Tin be
longed. There is little wonder that patrio
tism is on the wane in this country
when such things can come to pass
and the righteous indignation of the
people should be felt in every case of
this kind.
If Taddy Tin had succeeded in kill
ing the white men it is probable,
judging from the past record in the
case, the government officials in the
case, would have sent him a medal of
honor.

LIQUID SPIRITS RETURNED
TO EARTH WHICH GAVE IT

FLETCHER'S LECTURE
BEST OF LYCEUM COURSE
The lecture given by Thomas
Fletcher Brooks as the last number of
the 1916 lecture course, was truthful
ly a case of leaving the best till the
last. Mr. Fletcher held his audience
spell-bound for two hours, moving
them from uncontrollable laughter, to
the consideration of the most serious
problems of life. His subject: "The
Martyrdom of Fools" was full of
wise counsel. He said that only three
out of every one hundred men were
capable of original thinking, and
showed that the world still martyrs
men who have the courage to stand
for justice nnd original thinking. They
are martyred not by the cruel physi
cal forms the ancients employed, but
are martyred none the less effectively,
by modern methods of social ostra
cism, salary reduction, slander and
other such forms.
The one o'clock meeting at the Em
press theatre was not very largely at
tended, and although Mr. Fletcher
was capable of telling the clerks and
business men of our city much more
than he did about civic welfare, still
the advice given our business men and
especially clerks was something they
could put into direct practice, and was
something which will bring them di
rect monetary returns if put into
practice. The comparison of the effi
cient clerk and the lazy self satisfied
type was very strongly put The
forty minutes spent in listening to
Mr. Fletcher was time well invested
for the business men present.
Mr. Fletcher's suggestion to the
citizens of Flagstaff that we awake to
the possibilities with which we are so
plentifully surrounded, that we take
on new energy and strive for greater
civic improvement is one that we must
recognize. Flagstaff needs to have
some of the nation's authorities on
city planning and city government
with us for a few days to steer us in
the right direction along this line.
People who heard Mr. Fletcher's
lecture say that he gave the best lec
ture that has ever been given on any
Lyceum Course ever presented in
Flagstaff.
