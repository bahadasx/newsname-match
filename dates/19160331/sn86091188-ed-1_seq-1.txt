Benefits of Direct Legislation.
FTditor of Idaho Hecrtrder:
The people of Idaho have given
their approval to tin* principles of the
Initiative, referendum and recall
Idaho's legislature lias refu«ed to com
ply with the public wish. I do not
know the reason except tiiat It lieing
Republican, it holds to the general
idea of the present leadership of that :
party, that the popular desires are noi »
to ta* considered when ll comes to
him ion and t hat promise« iieh.ri* an j
elect ion are sufficent.
Hired legislation is needed iu Idaho,
as much as any state tiiat Is without I
it. Taxation Is high here because
those who vote taxes upon tlie peoph ;
do not «tiare In the tiurden in mauv '
Instances I make tills statement
without forgetting that there area few
mean Ire rs of our legislature who do not
misrepresent or disregard the pu inn
will. Bui speaking generally no uu

public duty t<«i short fora majority <>t
its memtiers to give their unbiased at
tention to public welfare. The tempt a
tloiu* thrown around a legislature are
great and. unfort,unstely, there ate a!
ways more weak memtiers than strong
oms in am t«sly of men. It Is tie* "*e
«oide system that is at fault and it
must t>* superceded by direct popu ar
vote on public questions that com -ein
