UNDERTAKING BUSINESS SOLD
A deal was consummated Tuesday
whereby the undertaking business
conducted tor a number of years by
Darid Curtis was sold to C. E. Sparl
ing and Earl Mannls. Mr. Sparling
is one of Seward county's prominent
farmers living about two miles from
town, and Mr. Mannls Is the gentle
man who had charge of the business
for Mr.. Curtis while he was away
-several weeks recently. He is a grad
uate undertaker and was connected
"with the firm of Johnson & Johnson
of Hutchinson for four years.' Mr.
Mannls formed a good opinion of
' Liberal during the few weeks he has
een here and has decided to locate
;and become one of the town's busi
ness men. The Democrat is pleased
to extend the hand of fellowship to
the new firm, and express its regrets
;at Dave's retirement from that line.
He has been in Liberal about six
years, and during that entire time
the night has never been too dark or
the trip too long for him to answer
;any call that came to him, and many
-who have met with death and mis
fortune in the family during that
time will bear testimony to his hav
ing at all times been lenient in the
financial end of the deal, and com
petent in the professional part. He
Us as yet undecided what line of work
"he will engage in or where he will
locate, but we would like mighty well
to see him stay in Liberal.
FOUND NO OIL AT GATE
The oil well at Gate, Oklahoma,
-which has been watched with inter
est by numerous Liberal people, has
proven to be no oil well at all. The
following article regarding it was
taken from the Forgan Eagle:
"The Gate oil well went the way
all good prospect holes go in unprov-
'en territory. The drillers quit drill
ing right when the prospects seemed
the best and pulled out all the cas
ing. The hole was down about 2900
leet and in what was said to be oil
sand, but we understand the drillers
claim that the well caved in and filled
up with salt water and in order to go
deeper it would be necessary to buy
'casing'' which would -cost about ?V
400. . The question of oil in Beaver
county is still unsettled and the peo
ple of Gate believe that oil was
struck at about 1300 feet. However
It seems more wells will be dug in
-the near future and an effort made to
find oil without dispute."

THE NATIONAL-TWELVE HAS
GRIEF
On Tuesday John W. Baughman,
at the wheel of his new National 12,
and Earl Cooper were "out north, of
Hayne on some sort of a grafting
tour; all cylinders were working fine,
and It promised to be a pleasant trip.
An uneducated Jack Rabbit, not be
ing accustomed to 12-cylinder cars,
by his actions challenged Mr. Baugh
man to a race over the prairies, and
this set the sporting blood of Mr. B.
a-boiling, and he opened her up. The
Jack In the lead and the National
gaining all the time, it was apparent
to the four-legged creature that
something must be done, so he
sought shelter on the Rock Island
tracks, knowing that he was safer on
the R. I. tracks than on any public
highway in the vicinity', and Mr.
Baughman being in hot pursuit
thought that by a quick spurt , he
would clear the track entirely, but a
second or two later he had changed
his mind, and decided that the Rock
Island is building Its tracks too high
from the ground in some placeB, and

this happened to be one of the some
places. The oil in the car immedi
ately went on an extended vacation,
all 12 cylinders were apparently
in a dazed condition, and the Jack
with a sarcastic grin sauntered down
the track looking for No. 1 or the
Plug, or anything that would give
him a real race. Upon securing the
assistance of J. B. Fackler, with a
fine team of mules co-operating, the
National was headed Ltberalward,
and assisted on the last lap of the
Journey by the Cadillac 8, L. W.
Stevesson officiating.
Just at dusk that evening, when
quiet reigned supreme in ' Liberal,
two of the section hands who had
been working ' in ' the vicinity of
Hayne, tore madly into town look
ing for Mahoney, the Oil King. Mr.
M. at once,, and with much secrecy,
ent Joe Bryson and O. M. Woods,
two of his partners-in-crlme, to
Hayne, as according to statements at
tributed to the section hands, there
was oil flowing fluently down the
right of way of the R. I., but on a
thorough examination by Expert
Woods, it was declared to be nothing
more than perfectly good cylinder
oil 'which was purchased to be used
in the National 12.
WOMAN'S CLUB PLAY TONIGHT
The Liberal Woman's Club will to
night present "The Trail of the Lone
some Pipe, a four-act comedy drama,
at the-opera nouse. The dramatised
version of this famous novel is said
to be more beautiful than the story
as told in the book. Specialties will
be put on between the first and sec
ond act by the Liberal quartet, in
cluding Blanche Brereton, Velma
Craig, Gene Stouter and Earl Craig.
The play is given-for the library fund
of the Woman's Club, and is directed
by Lenn Harris. From the way the
seats have been selling a crowded
house Is expected tonight. It will be
put on at Forgan tomorrow night,
and may also be played In Beaver in
the near future.
The people of Liberal can rest as
sured that spring is now here. The
railings 'at the Smith and George
comers are daily carrying their full
load of loafers, "ambler" shooters
and woman oglers. A row of spikes

LIBERAL BOY IN THE K. N. G.
Herman Kimble of Literal has the
average Normal student bested
when It comes to diversity of work.
While he, as head cook, is making
biscuits and baking at the students'
co-operative boarding club, his step
and carriage Is that of a Kansas Na
tional Guard and be certainly hums
some tune.
His success as a "general of the
pots and pans" Is shown by the fat
healthy boys that leave the dinner
table at the "coot" club. The tune
that he hums could probably be -traced
back to the Christian Church
choir, the Glee Club, or the chorus
"Messiah" which will feature In the
Emporia Music Festival, April 17 to
23, for this red haired freshman
sings in all these organizations. Be
sides carrying enough work to burn
the midnight oil, he wears the K. N.
G. uniform and nightly dreams of a
trip to the Mexican border.
