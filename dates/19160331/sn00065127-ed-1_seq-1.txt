STATE STUDENT ON SQUIRRELS
Offers Authority and Suggestions In
Preserving Both Birds and the
Squirrels in Home City.
Brookings, S. Mar. 2", 1916
Editor of Dakota Farmer's Leader.
Canton, South Dakota.
Dear Sir
I have been watching, with a
great deal of interest, the trouble
that has arisen over the squirrel and
bird question, and as I am In favor of
keeping the squirrels, provided a so
lution can be found, I have taken the
liberty to offer the following extract
taken from "Useful Birds and Their
Protection" by Edward II. Forbush.
"All who desire to harbor and pro
tect birds must eliminate the bird
killing cat. The cat is of some ser
vice in preventing the increase of ratb
and mice in dwellings, as well as that
of other small rodents of the lie Ids
and woods but the vermin of the
house may be controlled by traps and
poison, while those of the tield may
be restrained by llawks and Owls. A
ferret will in a short time drive all
the rats from a building. A smart fox
terrier or a good "ratter" will practi
cally exterminate the rats about a
farmhouse. As the cat is not an ab
solute necessity, and as It is a potent
carrier of contagious diseases, which
It spreads particularly among chil
dren, it would be far better for tbe
community if most of the bird killing
cats now roaming at large could be
painlessly disposed of."
In another article Mr. Forbush
writes: "Of sixty-seven nests observed
from April to August, only twenty
six prospered. Of the forty-one de
stroyed, fifteen were known to have
been robbed by cats, eight by the gar
den dormouse, three by Jays and two
by Magpies."
In his discussion on squirrels Mr.
Forbush writes: Fzrmers know well

how to deal with foxes, weasels,
minks, skunks, and raccoons. They
regard squirrels as pests but it is ex
tremely probable that It Is only the
Individual squirrel that robs bird's
nests. Mr. A. C. Dike writes me that
one season when he was carefully
watching the birds about his place he
saw tbe eggs and young in eight birds
nests destroyed by the red squirrel
but that in each case the same squir
rel was the culprit, for he was able to
identify it, because it had lost part
of its tail in escaping from the cat.
Where birds show no alarm when
squirrels approach their nests, the
presumption Is that the squirrels are
Innocent. The beauty and grace ex
hibited in the forms and motions of
squirrels have made them favorites
with many people who will not wish
to kill them. Others will wish to a
vold killing Crows, Jays, Hawks, or
even cats Hut all should regard it a
duty to protect the nests of birds from
these marauders. Some experiments
in this direction have been made. In
these experiments Mr. Forbush sug
gests building nesting boxes for the
small birds and protecting the others
by devices.
[Here Mr. Laxson inserts sketches,
one of a metal cone with large end
down so squirrels can not get past it
and another of a band of metaf about
12 inches long around the tree or pole
so they can not get hold to climb
higher.—Ed
These appear to me to a success
ful solution to the question and I be
lieve that they are deserving of a
trial.
Why not kill off the cats, whose
natural instinct is to destroy birds
and If a single squirrel is found rob
bing nests he can be done away with
and mayhap end the trouble.
Re*pectsully submitted,
L. J. Laxson.

Swanson-Engebretson.
On Wednesday, March 22, 1916, the
beautiful farm home of Swain Swan
son, in Fair view twp., two miles west
of Falrview, was the scene of a pretty
home wedtiing when Miss Opal Gun
hiieda Swansdh and Mr. Arthur En
gebretson were united in the holy
bonds of wedlock, Rev. A. E. Berg of
Falrview, pronouncing tbe words
which made this admirable couple
man and wife.
The invited guests, relatives and
near friends to the number of more
than sixty gathered early at the
Swanson home to witness the wedding
ceremony. The home had been ap
propiately decorated for the event,
and while the bride's sister Julia
Swanson played the wedding march,
the bridal pair tiled into their places
beneath an artistically decorated arch.
The bride was attended by her sister
Miss Mabel, while Daniel Engebretson
acted as best man, and iiiile Selma
Swanson as flower girl. After the
sweet strains of the wedding march
had ceased, the assembly was favored
with a solo by Miss ituby Engebret
son, accompanied by her sister, Miss
Mary.
The bride was handsomely gowned
in a beautiful white crepe-de-metlon,
trimmed with pearls and costly lace.
The groom was attired in a neat suit
of blue serge. Tbe bridesmaid wore a
dress of pink crepe-de-chene. After
the ceremony the "newly weds" were
kept busy for soma time shaking
hands and receiving congratulations
from everyone present. The fact that
Mrs. Thos. Rood, a long time friend
ot both Mr. and Mrs. Engebretson, in
congratulating the couple, kissed the
groom, caused much amusement
among the members of the merry
party, especially the young folks.

CANTON, SOUTH DAKOTA, FRIDAY. MARCH 31, 1910
Congratulations having been duly
extended, the happy pair and the
merry members of the party repaired
to the dining-room, where a sumtuous
wedding dinner awaited them. And
what a feast.' It was one of those de
licious dinners such as the Norwe
gians are famous for preparing. The
wedding cake had been prepared by
Mrs. Edwin Engebretson. The cooks
were Mrs. Thos. Rood, Mrs. Rosen
Engebretson and Mrs. Edwin Enge
bretson, while the Misses Gertie
Amundson, Julia Swanson and Ruby
and Mary Engebretson acted as wait
ers. Soon after dinner, which was
served at üve o'clock, the "newly
weds" were missed, but they were
caught in the act of escaping in a car,
and such a shower of rice and old
shoes has not been witnessed since
Adam was a child. Finally, however,
they were allowed to go on their way.
Their trip, we suppose, is to be ex
tended to the "Twin Cities." After
visiting with several relatives, they
will return and make their home on
the old farm where Arthur has resid
ed for the last number of years. Their
many friends extend congratulations.
Honor For Canton Pastor.
We have just learned that Rev. O.
B. Preston of our local Congregational
church has been greatly honored by
being chosen to take part on the pro
gram of the State Conference of Con
gregational churches which will meet
in Rapid City, June 23rd. It is very
seldom indeed that a minister resid
ing within the state is given a place
on the programs of the conference
consequently Rev. Preston's friends
are much pleased. Miss Margaret
Slattery who is a great worker among
the boys and girls was expected to be
present but it was found that her
time was all taken and she could not
be there so Rev. Preston was request
ed to take the time assigned to her.

STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA
A Proclamation By The Governor.
During the winter months in this
climate, quantities of waste paper,
rags, and various kinds of refuse and
rubbish accumulate. Such unsightly
accumulation not only seriously de
tracts from the beauty of the land
scape, but materially increases the
danger of tire and adversely affects
sanitary conditions. In different lo
calities the people have been carrying
on a propaganda for a general spring
cleaning and giving attention to re
moving waste and rubbish, cleaning
highways, streets and alleys, and
painting and renovating buildings.
To give impetus to this clean-up
movement, and to encourage those
engaged therein, I, Frank M. Byrne,
Governor of the State of South Dak
ota, do hereby designate the week of
May 1 to 0, inclusive, as
CLEAN-UP WEEK,
and ask the people of the state during
that week to give thought to, and
take part In a general clean-up cam
paign.
The springtime,' when Nature is
taking on a new garb, Is especially
appropriate for cleaning, renovating,
renewing and beautifying. Let us
give Nature a chance by removing the
repellent and hazardous refuse and
debris accumulated by our careless
ness. Let us clean up the streets and
alleys, the corners and angles about
buildings and the yards and spaces
surrounding our homes, using a little
fresh paint where needed, and thus
add to the attractiveness, comfort
and security of our surroundings.
Witness my hand and the Great
Seal of the State of South Dakota af
fixed hereto this twenty-fourth day of

Mountain Torrents Harnessed To
Electrify The "Milwaukee"
Over The Rockies.
In the fastnesses of the western
mountains, millions of tons of water
have for ages wasted their energy.
Meanwhile, to haul the country's traf
fic over the vast ramparts of the Rock
ies by steam traction has meant the
consumption of an enormous quantity
of the nation's coal supply and high
operating expenses.
It has been reserved for the Chicago,
Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway to
change all this—to abandon steam as
a motive power in the mountains and
to use the limitless energy of the har
nessed streams to electrically operate
Its trains.
Tbe electrification of 440 miles of
main line (115 miles now in operation)
passing mile-high over the Great Con
tinental Divide, marks a new era In
railroading and erects another mile
stone in the world's progress,
It means, the conservation of re
sources, more efficient and economical
operation, better maintenance of
schedules, smoother riding, and a
notable increase in travel delights.
In arranging your next trip to the
Pacific North Coast, remember that
it is only the Chicago, Milwaukee &
St. Paul Ily. that offers the advant
age of the short, direct electrified
line.
For literature and full information,
apply to local ticket agent of this
railway.
The Thief.
Henri Bernstein has written many
good plays. Amongst them all "THE
THIEF" stands preeminent. It is
his supreme success. The plot may
be told in a few words.
The heroine, a young woman of
weak character but with an infinite
capacity for love, baa centered ber af
fections upon a man of social position.
Without beauty or wealth she has no
means of attracting his attention and
so, in order to make herself desirable
in his eyes, she steals large sums of
money from her friends with which
she buys beautiful clothes. Her pecu
lations are discovered and attribut
ed to a young man who, knowing the
truth, remains silent to shield her.
That very love however, which at
first led her astray has ennobled ana
strengthened her character, and in
the wonderfully dramatic climax she
confesses her guilt.
This Fox feature will be at the
Lyric next Monday night. 10 and 20
