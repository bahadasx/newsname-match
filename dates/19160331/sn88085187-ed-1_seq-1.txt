<^- VOTE FOR PETTITIVND McGREGOR
Both Deserve Election;
Here's One Reason Why:
The Training They've Had
PETTIT
Everybody knows F. H. Pettit.
To say that of a candidate for public office means
one of two things.
It means either that he belonps to the old-fash
ioned type of oily politician who one day can toil a
church congregation how good and pure lie is. anil
the next day hob-nol. with political robber*. (W«
have one example, at leant, in the race.)
Or it means that everybody knows the man for
what he is worth, knows jtifct exactly where lie
stand*, and that he Rtands for community progress.
Every voter in the city l»OWi Pettit the man
and citizen. Whether or not they agree with him,
they know exactly where lie stands. They know
what they can expect of him.
Began Career in Tacoma 18
Years Ago as a Blacksmith
They know, without any "ifs," his views on
public questions, and tliev know that lie can ho
trusted to carry out these beliefs to the letter.
Everybody knows Pettit. for they have observed
him in private and business life and on the firing
line.
It takes a strong man to be any sort of a black
smith Hut to be a successful blacksmith it re
quires bruins, skill and purpose, as well as muscle.
It was as a blacksmith that Pettit came to Ta
coma 18 years ago. and It was not long before he
proved himself to be a successful blacksmith mid
one who could be trusted, lie owned his own shop
and built up a Rood business.
Helped Organize and Build up the
West Coast Wagon Company
Pettit was clear-headed and ambitious, lie be
came one of the organizers of the West Coast
Wagon Co., an enterprising Tacoma niniiufactiii inn
concern. In recent years lie has been one of the
concern's most valuable men.
Pettit Is known as one of the most able and
honest salesmen of the northwest. Tot some time
he was the representative for the Standard Hone
Shoe Nail Co., the largest manufacturers of horse
Bhoe nails in the country. He was entrusted win
full authority to handle its affairs without MKIMJ
for instructions.
Established Fine Record as
Commissioner of Public Safety
Everybody knows Pettit in the capacity of a
public officer. During the year he served us com
missioner of public safety four years ago, filling
out the unexpired term of 1.. \V. Roys, recalled, his
honesty of purpose and his ability never were ques
tioned, not even by his enemies.
As one of his bitterest enemies said recently, "I
know Pettit is honest because I tried to get to
him with money once and failed."
He has made a clean si'ecess of everything he has
set his hand to, and he promises to make a success
at the big job of being a public officer.

Before they gave ground, how
ever, they fought the Germans
hand-to-hand for hours.
While they were massed In the
struggle, artillery on both sides
was silent, fearing to kill friends
as well as foes.

LONDON, March 31.—With

but the eastern and southern
outskirts of Malanconrt, ParU
dispatches admitted today.
Henry .T. McGregor's entire lift has bei'n devoted
to the constrm lion of pul lie improvements such as
comes under the direction of t lit; commissioner of
public works.
lie came to Taoonia with his family In ISSs.
Before that time he had been a railroad contractor
and bridge builder, having charge of construction
of the Chicago. Milwaukee & St. Paul lines through
.Missouri.
When lie first came, to the northwest, McGregor
had complete chaiTe of construction of the Seattle,
Lake Shore & Eastern railroad from Seattle to Sno
ilUHlmie cit\. After that work was finished he be
came chief superintendent for the Allen & Nelson
Bridge Building & Pile Driving Co.
During the first few years of his residence in
Tacoma, McGregor worked independently as a con
tractor of house construction. In three yenrs he
constructed an average of one tIOUM a month.
Mayor John W. Lin<k appointed him as commis
sioner of public works in Itff, and he held that
office two years.
Had Hand in Great Deal of City's
Most Important Construction Work
At that time the public works department had
vastly more work than it has ;( t present, as the
light, water and fire departments were included in
it.
During the two yean that he was commissioner.
McGregor completed construction of three: city
reservoirs, two standpipes, and 12 miles of streel
paving. Some of the best pavements in the city
were laid then.
After leaving the city hall, McGregor became
superintendent in charge of coiiMruction of the
municipal power plant at La Grande. He was the
chief aide of Maim Pederson. who had the contract
for building the great power station.
W. W. Seymour, who later became mayor, re
'ained McGregor to take charge of i onstrm tion of
a large auxiliary to the water system of Kllens
!)Urg, which he owned. McGregor built a 1100.000
water system, doing all the engineering work him
self, and saved $17,0<»(l on the estimated tost.
Directed Building of Seattle's
Million Dollar Port Project
When that was completed, he returned to Hans
"ederson, who had a contract for construction of
he $ 1 ,(lOU,iMio port district warehouses, terminals,
locks and cranes at Seattle. McGregor was super
intendent in charge of the work, and at its con
>lelion received a flattering letter from the Seattle
iort commissioners.
Pederson next sought McGregor to take charge of
building a |3?&,00fl bridge over the Lake Wash
ington canal. McGregor refused, because the work
of placing pier foundations had already begun and
he did not approve of the early construction. Later
the pier foundations washed out.
At this stage of his career, the contractor was
stunned by the deatli of his wile, and, shortly after
wards, of his boh.
Since completing the port district work in Seat
tle McGregor has had charge of various construc
tion projects, all of a more or less public nature.
German artillery has rendered
other defenses untenable.
The highway intersecting the
village is covered with a pall of
dust and smoke, shot with bright
flashes of lfaine as French guns
shower shells on the enemy,

The average person of toda>,
fed on lurid tales by sensation

has ii warped
idea of the
"'criminal clas*. '
You imagine a
convict to be a

teeth showing In
a gleam ot hate,
