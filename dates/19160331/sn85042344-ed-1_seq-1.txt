CAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE,
colonia ifi:i.AX. chiiicahca,
Mexico, March 20. ( I!y motor to Col.
umbus, X. M.. March .10.) In few
campaigns has the American army
been called upon for more successive
teals of endurance, pluck and ability
of Its men to think quickly In emerg
encies than in the present chase of
Villa. From the day when the troops
went over the bonier of Xew Mexico
and the officers in the hard march
across the desert began calculating on
howjinuch water out of their canteens
to puiir clown the back of half fainting
men ami how much to save for the
thirst of the final hour of the march,
every minute has occupied the In
ventive Kenius of the men who are
projecting tliis expedition more than
two hundred miles into .Mexico.
The law problems, such as the
chase of Villa and the supply of
means of existence to fust mounted
columns, are anions the military se
crets covered by the censorship. Hut
the hundreds of new problems mostly
individual, which have been solved on
siKht by the American fighting men
null which are not forbidden publica
tion, are to some extent an illustration
of the spirit of the larger military
Hiest Ions that have been met.
Today, for example, n snowstorm
swept over field headquarters. The
driving snow particles seemed all the
more uncomfortable because they
struck laces which during t lie pre
vious das had received scorching
sciiliiii ns'. ono caahy man in dis
gust exclaimed:
Then Hiiihl Fires.
"The further south we go the
colder It gets." Cut meanwhile an in
. funtr.unan found un empty tin, rec
tangular in shape, in which he cut
some slits near the bottom for venti
lation. He piled in some wood, started
a fire In the tin, set it outside of a
tent until the first smudge was over
and the sticks were blazing and then
brought it inside the lent where it
furnished warmth equal to a stove
and a pleasant aroma. It worked so
well that the camp was searched for
oil tins.
At another camp the men had gone
In with baggage so light that no one
had anything larger than a shelter
lent Just large enough for two men to
Hie under. Three days later, however,
to the civilian there was the regula
te.?! army outfit anil the patrol sta
tion. Probably none except a prac
ticed ye Would have noted that the
commanding officer's tent had en
tirely the wrong angle at Its top. It
was not a tent but a makeshift pieced
together out of some discarded tar
paulins and part of a smaller tent.
This officer had what he asserted
was his .Morris chair besides some
very comfortable barrels. The Morris
chair was mainly a box but it had n
back and roomy side arms made of
hoards reinforced by strips of g.ilveii
i d Iron. The officer said he had
found the hoards.
How They Culll It
"Cut wno brought nails on his
hike'."' he was asked.
"Nobody, we took the nails from
some boxes of supplies w hie h were
used up here."
"Who carried the saw?"
"Nobody with our outfit. We bor
rowed one saw while Its outfit was
halted In front of our camp."
"What did the wood carving?"
"The cook's hatchet."
Instructions not to occupy cities
have multiplied the men's problems,
for not only are the camps pitched at
a distance from cities, but the men
and officers stay away from the towns
v.hlch otherwise they might frequent
to make purchases of food supplies or
souvenirs.
The great Cottonwood trees which
abound wherever there Is water have
been the first comfort of this expedi
tion. The cottonwoods have furnished
--MSht foot bridges across the creeks,
the only natural shade against the
sun ami occasionally their Immense
trunks hnvc been used as shelters
against the eod. and and sleet dur
ing the quick changes of the climate.
Marking Ihe Roads.
The loss of horses on the force'd
marches Into Mexico, In Itself re
markably small, has been further re
sauced b'v the instincts of self-preser
vation of the trained cavalry animals
when they had to be left to shift for
themselves. Some of these animals
have managed to trail and finally
overtake the columns which had
dropped them.
The roads leading south from Co-
lumhiis to the expeditionary base are
mnrked with Ingenious wordless sign
posts. Engineers or truck drivers up
- oif discovering a fault or a turn In
the road which they wished to Indi
cate and having nothing with which
to make a sign board, have used
the thorny chaparral bushes which
cover nearly the entire country to u
height of two or three feet. Tho

OKLAHOMA CITY. March 30.
State Auditor E. K. Howard came
near being a victim of his own
observations made to friends at
luncheon a few days ago. The
' state auditor Is an Industrious
man and owns some oil property
which he hopes some day will
make It so he can enjoy the sen
sation of living without having
to work. He told his friends that
he wanted to be fixed pretty
soon so that he could quit public
life and attend to private bus
iness. From this It became whis
pered around that he was going
. to quit the office. Ho received
calls from newspaper men today
regarding his "resignation."
Then he had to explain the basis
of the story. Mr. Howard says
he probably will not be a candi
dal any more for public office.

Mr. Small at the conclusion of his
speech, "and 1 am authorized to say
to you that a reward of -'50 will be

John H. Simmons, Republican can

speaker.
"It Is the big things and not the lit
tle things thai count," he said, "and
we must not lose sight of the big
things while there Is so much talk
alioui the little things. The first thing
the Republican ticket proposes to do
If elected Is to make It possible lo
effect a speedy and proper solution
of the water problem, and to place
the affairs of our city on a business
basis and conduct the administration
in such a manner as to Inspire the con
fidence of Ihe people. I believe 111
treating every man courteously and if
I am elected 1 shall treat every Ueceni
citizen with courtesy, and never ask
him a iiieslio.i about his politics, i

freer In that respect than in many
years. I own no stock in any bank
or any corporation. My hands are
untied and if I am elected mayor I
will enter office with a clean slatp
and no political debts to pay. Had I
written the Republican platform my

today by Secretary Daniels, who will

omtiiltlce beiiins framing Its hill.
The secretary inlcleil In several re

thai there was no way of determining
what expenditure would be necessary
In tho future.

Criticism of Secretary Daniels' ad
ministration of the department foro
shailowod by Ihe course of certain
committee members In examining
previous witnesses, probably will ma-

program one by one. He will conclude

Secretary Daniel.'; urged I lie com
mittee lo report favorably Hie armor
plale factory lull, which lecciuly
passed the senate and which will be
i.nkcn up ne xt Tuesday.
A projectile plant, .Mr. Daniels de
chiieil, was vilaJly important to the
navy. With e oiiiiiiercial concerin
swaiiipml with war orders from Eu
rope, he said, prices were going up
and it had been virtually impossible
to obtain what the navy must have,
lie added that a uovernmeiit plant
would inn kr, it po.Msible to guard
against navy Inventions getting into
the hands of possilile enemy powers
as was now almost certain to be the
case.
"The condition in tl.e 1'iiited Slates
today is hi icily as follows," said the
secretary.
Tho navy wants armor pien ing pro
jectiles but it dens not want an infe
rior ciuality such as the manufactur
ers are willing to sell as such. Tin;
maniilaetiii eis, nit hough thi-y have
ample capacity and although they
know that projectiles in iie-eei'danee
with the leciuiriineiita can be pro
duced, are; unwilling to undertake
their production, but uie endeavoring
to force the navy depart mi ni to pay
the same price for an admittedly in
ferior product.
Only One Relief.
"What Is the answer? There can
be only one; that Is, for Ihe navy de
partment to own and operate its own
projectile plant. "
Secretary Da niels explained that his
request that the enlistment of fifteen
thousand additional men I.e autbo
i led this year wouldi bring the lorco
to the figure fixed by the general
board, approximately sixty-seven
thousand men. While hr thought It
Improbable that more than ten thou
sand more men could bo enlisted, be
pointed out thsl. with tho -uthoriza-

Tho secretin y urged the equipment

last nicht and the two thousand vis
iting delegates left for their respec
tive homes. ;
The gigantic conference was unani
mously proclaimed the most success
ful of Its kind ever held. Even tho
hardened globe trotters, the Interna
tional assoiiallon men, were en
thused with the doubling of tho
convention eleicgatlon. Its program
w.is balanced to the last degree, com
bining practical helps, powerful theo
retical pedagogy and deep spiritual
tones.
.1. M. Hall, superintendent of the
I'rcHbyterian Sunday school of this
city, was chosen president of the asso
ciation for the coming year without
opposition. In a later meeting or thu
ne w ixee ulivv committee C. II. Nich
ols was re-elected general state secre
tuiy at an increased salary.
The intrinsic importance of this
convention will be felt In the coinlmr
year and other years when the plan
for bililo study to be conducted by tho
church and accredited by the public
schools begins to get in its work
throughout the state. This system 111
de tail was presented to the general
session yesterday afternoon and ailopl
od with a keen spirit of enthusiasm
and optimism.
Credit in School.
Tho proposition Is for public schools
to add five per cent to the average
grade of every pupil below the eighth
grade who presents a eertifbute from
any minister in the city, stating tluit
the boy or girl has satisfactorily com
pleted a course ef bible study In thai
church. The schools, of course1, will
bo In a position to demand efficient
teachers and courses, but will In n i
oilier way Interfere with thu work.
This makes It possilile for every
church to train its boys and girls in
Its own way and according to Its own
