although the allied communication is
understood to have been prompeted
by the failure of the I'nited States

Surprise is expressed "that there
appears to ! no endeavor on the
part of the allied powers to determine
the rule of action" in respect to the
use of submaiines, and at the sug
gestion that there is great danger in
permitting neutral submarines to
viait waters that may be visited by
belligerent submarines. The govern
ment declares th it "responsibility for
anv conflict that may arise between
belligerent warships and neutral sub
marines on account of the neglect of
a belligerent to so distinguish between

entirely upon the negligent powers."

Policy of Disregard of Wandering Americans
ES'
E
In the words of a member of his
audience, James R. Garfield, one-time
secretary of the interior, "talked more
common sense to his hearers than
most political speakers we have had
here lately."
liefure quite the largest audience yet
seen on the Y. M. C. A. tejiniscourts,
be presented the record of Charles
Kvans Hughes, as a constructive criti
cizer of democratic methods, and in
terms that could not be misunderstood.
stated what Mr. Hughes will do in cer
tain vital exigencies, if elected.
Mr. Garfield began his speech by
paying a high tribute to Judge Kibbey. ,
who had preceded him on the plat
form. "The democratic press is trying to
make you believe that Mr. Hughes'
campaign is one of criticism. They try
to impress on the voters that he is of
fering criticism only. I am going to
take up each of their arguments and
show that where our candidate has of
fered criticism, he has also offered a
constructive policy to replace that
which he condemns."
With this announcement, the speaker
plunged into the argument. Taking
up first the democratic statement that
the administration has kept the coun
try out of war, he said:
"We are not at war. We are in a
state of dishonorable peace. The al
ternative to this is not war."
When asked why it had sent marines
to Vera Cruz, and pulled them out, and
why it had despatched Pershing's
column into Mexico, and was now ap
parently slowly withdrawing it, the
administration has returned no an
swer, according to Mr. Garfield. If
this is not war, what is it? another
question that has failed of reply, and
which is now commonly accounted the
big mystery of the present adminis
tration. "Mr. Hughes purposes to make the
name of American Citizen a proud one
to bear In the face of the world!" ex
claimed the speaker, and there was a
generous response.
Tne murder of Americans on sea and
land, the destruction of American
owned property, the outrages upon
American women, even within the
bounds of this nation, the utter disre
gard of American rights everywhere,
are topics that have been largely dis
cussed during the present campaign,
but never so clearly and dispassionate
ly as by Mr. Garfield.
His was not the eloquence that in
flames an audience to wild cheers, the
throwing of hats in the air. Rather,
he coolly put up to the voters the
exact facts of the case, and then as
coolly asked how they were going to
act on November 7. He pounded home
truth after truth, until there could be
no misunderstanding of the stand of
Mr. Hughes on international matters.
"The democrats are asking, 'what
would Mr. Hughes have done under
like circumstances in MexicoT And I
answer, that as a truly American
would, on the first murder of one of
his fellow citizens, have occupied the
order towns with a sufficient force
of soldiers to have patrolled the coun
try until absolutely satisfactory guar
antees had been exacted from the Mex
ican nation."
"The American name is not respected
throughout the world, now, for the
first time in 140 years. Ever since the
nation was founded, Americans have
een urged by the government to go
abroad invest, build up the American
name and create markets for American
trade. Hut now, the administration
has announced an entirely new policy.
Mr. Wilson stigmatizes every Ameri
can abroad as a dishonest man. Asked
which of the Americans abroad is the
promoter of dishonest deals, he has
refused to answer, leading to the in
ference that all are more or less
crooks." .
"Too proud to fight. That's a cloak
for the coward to hide his fear, for the
sordid to conceal the ulterior motive of
his acts."
The vaunted prnnperity of demo
cracy is it the result of democratic
rule? No. It comes from a war in
Europe."
On the tariff, Mr. Garfield spoke but
a few words, but they were impressive
ones. He described the hundreds of
thousands of beggars turned loose on
the streets of the eas when the demo
cratic tariff for revenue (but produc
ing none) put American Industries in
competition with cheaper European la
bor. This condition, he said, did not
exist out here, but It was 'poignantly
present with the eastern municipali
ties. .
Until it became necessary to respond
to the demands of clear thinking
northerners, President Wilson regarded
his solid south too highly to risk boost
ing, the child labor bill. There was a
clean cut. masterful bill passed the
house one that was simple and very-
effective for the purposes of the anti-
child labor people. It was too effective,
however, for the southern democrats;
whose support came chiefly from the
tremendous milling and manufacturing
Interests, employing child labor. But
finally, Wilson went before congress
and got the bill through tl Benate
but how sadly changed!
The heart had been cut out of it. Its
point was blunted, and in effect, it was

KIBBEY EXPERT
I IRRIGATION
PLEADS CAUSE
His voice batting a thousand per
cent, Judge Kibbey came back and
cored a tremendous success In bis
address on the need of Arizona of
somebody with a little irrigation in-
formaticn in the United States sen
ate, at the Y. M. C. A. stadium last
night. Jud;:e Kibbev led tht- program
nn,l was introduced by Chairman
Richard E. Sloan, as the republican
candidate for senator.
Taking up the mannerism of his
distinguished opponent, H. f. Ashurst,
Judge Kibbey declared, that although
averse to speaking of himself, he in
tended to do a lot of plain and fancy
boosting for one J. H. Kibbey. "I
am no gladhander." he fcaid "and I
believe an official should have other
qualities than that of being able to
meet perfect strangers and with oily
solicitude, inquire after remote mem
bers of their families.
"But I w ill not say anything against
Mr. Ashurst. I must say, however,
that he is using the grand peaks of
the San Franciscos, with their sum
mits bathed in the ineflable glory of
the rising and the setting sun, their
rugged sides clad in the stately pines,
as an argument for his re-election.
"I h creby pledge myself, that if
elected, I will continue to have those
peaks stand in a grand manner, up in
Coconino county, Just where they
stand now. The sun wil rise and set,
and in doing so, bathe them in in
effable glory. I intend to have those
pines clothe the rugged slopes until
a better use can be found for them.
"My opponent also pleads the cause
of heroism. He Rays that all the he
roes are not in Europe, and tells you
about the Lusitania going down, with
th big hole in its side and the stok
ers standing nt their posts until they
went down into the depths and were
embraced in the cold round arms of
the mermaids."
Quite Some Contrf U
In most effective contrast with the
campaign stuff of Mr. Ashurst, here
introduced thr.t a comparison might
be drawn. Judge Kibley then took up
the fybiect of his qualifications for
the office he seeks. He admitted
freely that he intended to push him
self forward, as a desirable candidate,
which he proceeded to do with vigor.
Of his coming to Arizona 28 years

th? Florence canal, and of his lifelong
study of the laws and usages of irri

Intimate details ef the formation of
h Water Users' Association, of the
arly fights to secure recognition for
the project, of the acquisition of the
distributing svstem. of the contro
versies over the cost all these were
presented bv the speaker.
He explained why it would be nec
essary to pay more than the original
cost of the dam. but insisted without
equivocation there must be no hint of
repudiation in the valley's attitude on
the payment ouestion. Yet there is
an unjust excess in cost, and he In
tends to advise the water users, of
which he is legal advisor, not to par
It. He called the excess costs the
result of disastrous mistakes, egregi
ous errors and costlv experiments.
The nower canal, estimated to cost
$90 oon and actually costing a million
nnd a half, originally intended to
supply water for power and revenue,
and now absolutely useless, was cited
as an examnle of engineering blunder.
for which ihe water users must not
be held to pay.
The reduction of the cost and the
construction of the Verde reservoir,
were things that are totally essential
o the future prosperous expansion of
this community. Judge Kibber told
his hearers. He closed by asking if
it were not true, that, w ith such pro''
lems coming up. It would be well for
the people of Arizona to have an irri
cation man in the senate and the
crowd though very liberally sprinkled
with democrats, tendered mo3t gener

"In the house of commons on June

home department stated that attention
had been drawn to an alleged telegr-am
relating to the Jutland battle which
appeared in certain American news
papers us having been sent from Lon

sage was included in any telegram sent
from this country.
"The home secretary referred on the
same occasion to previous cases in
t which messages which purported to be
from the London correspondent of the
International News Service bore no
likeness to the cablegrams actually
despatched.
"On the first occasion referred to,
the manager of the International News
Service in New York gave categorical
assurance that such an incident should
not happen again. On the second
occasion he made like promises, stating
that orders had been given that ex
traneous statements should not be in
serted in cable dispatches.
"On the third of September cable
grams were published in the United
States purporting to have come from
London 'by the International News

about the air raid of the previous night.
None of the statements in question was
in fact contained in any cablegram dis

'In view of this continued garbling

YUMA, Oct. 10. To an audience that

of the day, and to say that the large
audience was not with him from be
ginning to end and that votes were not
made for Mr. Hughes and the repub

an obvious fact.
In commenting on the Adamson bill
recently forced through congress by
Sam Gompers and the four railway
brotherhoods the speaker said:
"I shall not discuss that brand new
issue which the temperamental diplo

"Like the true American he is, Mr.

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
BALTIMORE, Oct. 10 Charles E.
Hughes, speaking in the great armory
here where Woodrow Wilson first
was nominated for the presidency,
tonight assailed Mr. Wilson's policy
toward the promotion of American
trade abroad, and replied to published
statements of Dr. Charles W. Eliot,
president emeritus of Harvard, en
dorsing the president's policy.
"Dr. Flint piecres the heart of the
matter," Mr. Hughes said, "and ho
finds that the record of the admin
istration means this: 'no interven
tion by force of arms to protect on
foreign soil American commercial and
manufacturing adventurers who. of
their own free will, have invested
their money or risked their lives in
foreign parts under alien jurisdiction.
'Think of the import of that, you
who represent the best genius of the
w-oild and are thinking of using it
abroad." Mr Hughes said.
"Think of that, you, who it is sug
gested are to be asked to finance the
chief undertakings of the world.
Think of that, merchants, salesmen.
tellers, clerks and dealers, who in
'serving the world' take you place
remote from your friends and safe
guards, in communities where revolu
tions are frequent and only respect
for your flag and the power it symbol
izes may stand between you and ruin
or even death."
Mr. Hughes read the democratic
platform plan of 1912 declaring for
the protection of American rights
abroad, and asqed if it were "molasses
to catch flies." He declared that the
protection it promised had been de
liberately and deplorable refused. He
quoted from a recent speech of the
president outlining the administra
tion's ideas with respect to the de
velopment abroad of American en
teprise and asserted that it was im
possible to "square the fine words
now- used with the actions" of the
administration.
"Dollar diplomacy," Mr. Hughes
said," "was what encouragement to"
fhe development of American inter
ests abroad was dubbed something
shockingly reprehensible.'
i "in consequence 1 mav rav
the
nominee added, 'that in respect to
American interests abroad we have
had not only diplomacy without dol
lars, but diplomacy without sense.
"During the past three years amt
a haif one would suppose that any
.American w-ho went to foreign lands
to advance American industry and
commerce was presumably a" bad fel
low, who had lost his rights. Why
not? Why, didn't he go abroad to
make money? Didn't he take his
American enterprise beyond our bor
ders? Wltfct a shameless thing. Let
his come home. That is the sort of
encouragement Americans have had."
"We now hear fine words as to

to arbitrate their demands would be
declined, a Mr. Adamson, a member of
congress, blandly but confidently de

How did he know that a democratic
president and a democratic congress
had already agreed with the brother
hoods to give them just such a law in

audience. And when he added that
after Mr. Hughes was elected on No

twenty-four hours whether to march
home or to Mexico City the applause
was deafening.
