llostoil, Mass., Oct. 9. The sub
marine arm of the Imperial German
navy ravaged shipping about 30
miles off the eastern coasti of the
United States yesterday. .-
Submarine activities began at tiay
llght Sunday, three miles east of
Nantucket Lightship, when the
sighted and signaled to top. Whoa
the submarine commander was satis
fled that she was an American ves
sel ho allowed her to proceed.
The submarine then moved In
close to the lightship where at 6
o'clock a. m., she stopped the Brit
ish steamer Strathdene, bound from
Now York for Bordeaux. After the
crew had obeyed orders to take to
the ship's boats the submarine sent
a torpedo into the Strathdene and
sank her. The raider patrolling the
vicinity of the trans-atlantlc steam
ship lane moved considerably to the
southward. At 10:45 o'clock she
balled tlfe British steaTner West
Point, London for Newport News,
with a warning shot. This was at a
point ten miles south of tho light
ship. The crew, took to the boats
and tho submarine torpedoed and
sank the steamer. No other vessel
was encountered'' until ' late In
the
afternoon.
At 4:30 o'clock six miles south
east of. tho lightship, the German
stopped the Stephano. Passengers
and crew were taken off In the ship's
boats and the undersea boat shot a
torpedo into the liner. As this did
not appear to disable the staunch
steel vessel it was supplemented by
gun lire. The submarine moved off
vJr"Jhout watting fof the Stephano to
slnk and she remained afloat until
10:05 o'clock last night.
Near sunset the British steamer
Kingston came within view of the
lo'utout on the submersible. The
same procedure was followed as with
the other vessels and at G o'clock tho
Kingston went down a short dis
tance southeast of the lightship.
Tho bright moonlight gave the
submarine a good chance to contin
ue operations in the evening. She
moved a little to the westward nnd
soon after dark stopped the Dutch
tramp steamer Bloomersdljk, bound
from New York for Rotterdam, three
miles soutli of the lightship. Sup
posedly on (lie theory that she was
carrying contraband, the steamer
was sunk after the crow had entered
small boats. The submarine left hef1
still afloat, but she went down at
8:03 q'clock.
A little later the Norwegian
ntcamer Christian Knudsen, New-
York for London, was similarly halt
ed nnd sent to the bottom. Three
other steamera were reported sunk
early to-day. The Kansan mean-
SUBMARINES
while had sent broadcast radiograms . the exploiters of children and gree
telllng of the submarine's appear- J dy concessionaires. ( It is their mil
ance in the vicinity of tho lightship.
The We;H Point also was Able to
flash off brief mfssages, giving word
of her plight before she was aban
doned by liar crew. These dispatches
were picked up nt Newport and a
fleet of United States torpedo de-
lltrnvAra wna l morlfnt aAr ni.ila.aH
ordered
out to pick up tho crews.
Thrpughout tho day and night the

New York, Oct. 7. Thomas A.
Edibon-and Henry Ford, arm in arm,
walked into the offlce of Chairman
Vance C. McCormick at Democratic
national headquarters to-day. They
wanted to And out how they, could
best direct their eftorts to Insure
Wilson's re-election. Mr. McCor

they took him at his word. The two
went to luncheon with the chairman '
and Secretary of the Navy Daniels,
and conferred, particularly with re
gard to methods of reaching the in-
dependent voters of the country.
"Give the people the facts," de
clared Mr. Edison, "and It will be- a
Wilson landslide. No President
ever faced such problems, no Presi
dent ever made such a record of
achievements. It is not alone that
Woodrow Wilson has statesmanship;
he has leadership, too. I have al
ways been a Republican, but I. put
my country above party. In a world
crisis, with yie fate of America In
tho balance, I would take shame to
myself if I did not put myself be-
hind a man who has given us peace
with honor, prosperity with Justice
and preparedness without militar
ism."
Mr. Ford was no less emphatic.
"Like Mr. Edison," he said, "I am a
Republican. But I cannot stay with
a party that puts office-seeking first
nnd America last. President Wilson
has saved the United States from
tho horrors and desolation of
International war. Ho has saved us
from industrial wreck. His domes
tic policies have given now strength
to legitimate enterprise,' protected

ABUNDANT EVIDENCE
OF REAL PROSPERITY

Receipts lu Kentucky

Washington, Oct. D. The Pros
perity of the people of Kentucky and
Southern Indiana Is Indicated in
postal savings receipts for recent
fiscal years, as compared by the pos
tal savings btlreau of the Post-ofllce
Department, a significant feature
being that during tho past four
years these deposits Increased In
practically evely instance.
Among Kentucky cities for which
figures as submitted for the fiscal
years ending June 30, 1913, 1914,
i91o and 1910, respectively, depos
its are noted as follows:

The avidity with which the thrif

indicated by the fact that Butte,
