THE FORTNIGHTLY
First Meeting of the Year Will Be
Next Saturday.
The Fortnightly year opens next
Saturday afternoon, October 14th,
with a genuine treat for all who at
tend. The officers, eager that this
first program shall establish a high
standard for the Club's twenty-fifth
season, have selected from the list of
fine speakers brought to their notice
the one who seemed the best of all
and he is coining. He is a Japanese
named Toyokichi lyenaga, who was
educated in this country, graduating
from Oberlin College, and taking a
post graduate course at John Hap
kins. Returning to Japan he held pro
fessorships in two Universities till
1896, when he became a secretary for
the Foreign Office. From that posi
tion he served as Commissioner of the
Japanese Government to Persia,
Turkey. India and China. In 1900 Dr.
lyenaga returned to America and
joined the Faculty of the University
of Chicago as Professorial Lecturer
for twelve years. Then he moved to
New York, and is now managing direc
tor of the East and West News
Bureau, whose aim is the dissemina
tion of trustworthy news of Japan in
America, and the promotion of friend
ly relations between the two coun
tries. During the past fifteen years
he has appeared before every varley
of audience from the academic to the
Chautauqua.
The University of Chicago gives
this recommendation: "Dr. Iyenaga's
success in University Extension and
popular lecturing has placed him in
the front rank of platform speakers;.
He is bright, witty, entertaining, and
at the same time scholarly and in
structive. He. is the peer of any man
today discussing the problems of the
Orient."
Music for the afternoon will be fur
nished by Mrs. L. H. Ross and Mrs.
Amyel Baker. Mrs. Amyel Baker will
sing a Japanese lullaby and Mrs..L. H.

the Japanese national hymn.
Tea will be served after the pro
gram. Owing to the expense incurred
in securing Dr. lyenaga the price for
guest ticketB will be twenty-five
cents. The meetings of the club will
be held at the Congregational church
chapel and will begin at 3 o'clock.
Dues may be paid to the treasurer,

ANTICS OF PURE GLYCERIN.
This Queer Substance I Endowed
With Peculiar Properties.
One of the great nd vantages of glyc
erin lu its chemical employment is the
fact that It neither freezes nor evap
orates under any ordinary tempera
ture. No perceptible loss by evaporation
has been detected at n temperature
less than "JOU degrees F., but if heated
Intensely It decomposes with a smell
that few persons find themselves able
to endure. It burns with n pale (lame,
similar to that from alcohol, ir heated
to u bout .'100 degrees and (ben ignited.
Its iKilievaporatlvo qualities make the
compound of much use as n vehicle fur
holding pigments nnd colors, ns in
stamping und typewriter ribbons, car
bon pipers and the like.
If the pure glycerin be exposed for a
long time to a freezing temperature it
crystallizes with the appearance of
sugar candy, but these crystals being
once melted it is almost an impossi
bility to get them again into .the con
gealed slate. , i
If a little water be added to' the
glycerin no crystallization will take
place, though under u sufficient degree
of cold the water will separate and
form crystals, amid which the glycerin
will remain in its natural state of
fluidity. If suddenly subjected t In
tense cold pure glycerin will form a
gummy mass which cannot be entirely
hardened or crystallized.
Altogether it is quite a neculiur sub
stance. v
After extensive tests French experts
decide that modern violins are equal
in tone to, If not better thun, old ones
of great reputation.

Contention of Entente Allies Flatly
Rejected
NOTE RESENTS INTERFERENCE
Warning Given That Responsibility
.Will .he Exacted if American. Sub
marines Are Attacked By Mistake
Washington, Oct. 10. The reply of
the Uuited States to the Entente
Allies' contention that belligernt sub
marines should be barred from Amer
ican waters, roadsteads and harbors
was made public at the State Depart
nient today.
It Is a rejectloa of the viewpoint of
the protesting Governments and a
declaration that this Government "re
serves" its liberty of action in all re
ppects" and will treat visiting sub
marines in Its traditional spirit of neu
trality.
The American memorandum is dat
ed August 31 and is a reply to the
memoranda of August 23 from France,
reat Britain, Russia and Japan. Sub
sequently Italy and Portugal sent
Identic memoranda and received the
same reply.
The tone of the American memoran
dum reflects the temper of the Ad
ministration in its controversies with
the Entente Allies, it is without the
customary trimmings of diplomatic
correspondence and ends w ith a warn
ing to the Entente Allies that they
will be held responsible if American
submarines are mistaken for German
I'-boats by their , cruisers seeking
German undersea craft.

ARK
RAN OVER A FORD "
High Powered Packard Wrecked the
Davis Truck.
Seymour Van Santvoord's Packard
car while being driven down Main
street at a high rate of speed Tues
day afternoon ran over Charles
Davis' Ford truck in front of the
Cooper residence. The truci. was
driven by Charles Davis, jr., aud the
Packard by Alfred Wade.
Davis had turned onto the car track
to pass a load of lumber and lound
the Packard bearing down on him
with no Fgn of slowing up or giving
him his right of way. At '.ha last
moment Davis tried to tarn, but It
was too late.
Davis and Adron Hill wio were in
the Ford were thrown out, but not
badly hurt. Both cars were damaged
but the Ford mostly.
.The accident is the natural result
of too fast driving on the village
streets which has been permitted all
summer and has a tendency to grow
worse. Wade is an expert driver and
could easily have avoided the truck
if it had remained on the car track,
but failed to make proper allowance,
for an inexpert driver and a slowly
moving car.
GLAD TO LEAVE TEXAS
Former Bennington Boy Sees Service
With Pennsylvania Regiment.
Mrs. John Carolan has recently re
ceived several letters from her broth
er, Hugh Ellsworth, who has been on
the Mexican border with one of the
Pennsylvania regiments, the 18th in
fantry which went out from Pittsburg.
The 18th was one of the last regi
ments to be held on the border and
the former Bennington boy has had
some trying experiences. According
to Ellsworth, the 18th is one of the
crack regiments of the national guard
and it was held in Texas alter other
units from Pennsylvania were sent
home because of its efficiency.
Like nearly all of the guardsmen
who were sent to the border he is
overjoyed because of the prospect of
soon getting out of the country.
One of the disagreeable features of
camp life in the Rio Grande terri
tory, according to Ellsworth is the
sand storms which he writes were
more than usually numerous and
severe daring the first week of Octo
ber. The sand finds its way into the
tents in spite of every precaution and
the guardsmen were obliged to wrap
toweld aho-Jt thair' Tace3 In order to
obtain any sleep.
He expected that the regiment
would leave the border for Pittsburg
some titnP this month and that the
boys would receive a grand reception
in the Smoky City.
Ellsworth has a poor opinion of the
Mexicans and from his letters oii3
would judge that he was disappointed
because the American soldiers were
not permitted to shoot them on sight.
WHITE PINE THREATENED
Blister Rust Germinates on Currant
and Gooseberry Bushes.
State nursery Inspectors, state for
esters and ttlier official representa
tives from New Hampshire, Vermont,
New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Is-,
land, and Massachusetts, met at Fall
River, Massachusetts on September
25 at the invitation of the Massa
chusetts State Board of Agriculture
to examine a serious outbreak of the
white pine blister rust on native white
(line. This examination proved plain
ly to all that the blister rust Is a
deadly enemy of the white pine.
Reports given by the representativ
es of the states showed that the white
pine blister rust Is already w idely pre
valent throughout the New England
States and eastern New York, and as
this dangerous disease uses the cur
rant and gooseberry as a host plant
to grow upon, nnd spread very rapid
ly from currant to currant and from
the currant to the pine, it was the
unanimous opinion of all present that
as the only way to avert the impend
ing catastrophe, and save the white
pine, would he through a complete de
struction of all currant and goose
berry bushes and flowering currants.
the public should be given this infor
mation at once.
Tliis disease was brought into the
United States from Europe on white
pine seedlings. In the spring the
spores or seeds are blown by the wind
from the diseased pines to the currant
and gooseberry leaves. The seeds
germinate, penetrate the leaf tissues
and produce a rust on the underside of
the leaves in the late summer and
fall. The leaves produce millions of
tiny spores or seeds capable of infect
ing tho pines, which once thoroughly
infected cannot recover.
The currant nnd gooseberry leaves
in large areas throughout the New
England States and Eastern New
York are now infected with the blister
rust in the stage when It returns to
the white pine, and the immediate re
moval of currant and gooseberry bush
es Is necessary to save our white pine
trees. It is especially urgent that all
black and (lowering currant bushes
within half a mile of white pine
should be destroyed at once, since
these varities are partlculary suscept
lhle to the disease.
