REPLY TO THE
NOTE Of ALLIES
(Br Auorlatcd Praia.)
WASHINGTON. Oct. II. The -text
of the American memorandum, reply
ing to that of the allied governments
regarding treatment of belligerent
submarines in neutral ports, is as
follows: ...
The government of the' United
States has received the identic mem
oranda of the governments of France,
Great Britain, Russia and Japan In
which neutral governments are ex
horted "to take efficacious measures
tending to prevent belligerent sub
marines, regardless of their use, to
avail themselves of neutral waters,
roadsteads and harbors."
This government points out the
facility possessed by such craft to
avoid supervision or surveillunce or
determination of their national char
acter and their power "to do injury
that is inherent In their very nature,"
as well as "the additional facilities"
afforded by having at their disposal
places where they can rest and re
plenish their supplies. t
Apparently on these grounds the
allied governments hold that "sub
marine vessels must be excluded
from the, benefit of the rules hereto
fore accepted under International war
regarding the admission and sojourn
of war and merchant vessels in neu
tral waters, roadsteads, or harbors;
any submarine of a belligerent that
once enters a neutral harbor must be
held therefore" and therefore the al
lied governments warn the neutral
powers of the great danger to neutral
submarines attending the navigation
of waters visited by the submarines
of belligerents.
In reply ' the government of the
United States must express Its sur-
