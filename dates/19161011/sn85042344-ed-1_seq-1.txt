Will Confer Again Today.
President Wilson and Secretary
Ionising have discussed at length tho
visit of a Herman submarine to waters
itdlaocnt to the coast of Ihe I'nlted
States and will continue their confer
ence Wednesday. The Herman under
sea craft which pluycd havoc with
enemy neutral steamers off Nantucket
Sunday has not been heard of si nee
the last steamer was sent to the bot
tom Sunday night.
Tho text of the Amerlcun memo
randum replying to that of the al
lied governments regarding treatment
of belligerent submarines In neutral
ports Is as follows:
Tho government of tho ('lilted
States has received the identical
memoranda of tho governments of
France, Oreat Ilrltaln. Russian and
Julian In which neutral government
are exhorted "to take effleaelous
measures tending to prevent belliger
ent submarines, regardless of their
use, to avail themselves of neutral
waters, roadsteds and harbors."
These governments point out the
facility possessed by such craft to avoid
supervision or survelllanco or deter
mination of their national character
and their power "to do Injury that Is
Inherent in tholr very nature, asweh
as tho "additional facilities" ul forded
by having ut their disposal places
where they can rest uiul replenish
their supplies.
Asked Submarines I collision.
Apparently on these grounds tho
allied governments hold that "subma
rine vessels must be excluded from
tho benetlt of the rules heretofore
accepted under liiterunlional law re
garding the admission and sojourn of
war uiul merchant vessels In neutral
waters, roadsteds or harbors; any sub.
marine of a belligerent that once en
ters a neutral harbor must be hold
there" and therefore-t he allied gov
ernments warn tho neutral powers of
the gloat dancer to neutral subma
rines attending tho navigation of
waters visited by the submarines of
belligerents.
In roplv tho government of the
lulled States must express lis sur
prise that there appears to be an
f ldeavor of the allied powers to de
I rmlne the rule of action governing
what they regard us a "novel situ-
ctlori" In respec to the use ol su1,"! i
t:nes In time of war and to enforce
leooptance of"that rule, at least in
nart. bv warning neutral powers m'
t ie great danger to their submarines
I : waters that may bo visited by bel-
-'i rent submarines.
In the opinion of the government
I ' the I'nited States the allied pow
ers have not set forth any clrciiin
t aticos nor Is the government of the
I Tiited States at present aware of any
eveumstanees concerning the use of
Tar or merchant submarines which
o'ld render the etisli-'l' lilies of
I ternatlonal law inapplicable to
I ion!.
Can't Dictate te l ulled Slates.
' 111 view of this fact and of the
I .tico and warning of the allied
wits announced in their memor
l ,1a under acknowledgment It Is in
e imhent upon the government of the
1 tilled States to notify the govern
I ents of France, Oreat Britain, Rus-
I and Japan that so far as the I
t '-atment of either war or merchant
i bmarlnes In American waters is
ncornod tho government of tho
1 nited States reserves Its liberty of
l tlon in ull respects and will treat.
I eh vessels as in Its opinion iiecomes
I ,o action of a power which may be

t ward establishing tho principles of
utrallty and which for over a een
I :ry has maintained those principles
I , the traditional spirit and with tho
j gh sense of Impartiality in which
I icy were conceived.
In order, however, that there should
be ':o misunderstanding as to the at
titude of the I'nlted States the gov
ernment of the l.'nlted States an
nounces to the allied powers that It
holds It to be tho duty of belligerent
powers o distinguish between sub
marines of neutral and be'ilgerent na
tionally slid that responsibility for
ny conf'iot-that may urleu lutweon

13 Hughes, speaking tonight in the
armory here where Woodrow Wilson
was first nominated for the presi
dency, assullcd Ihe president's polley
toward the promotion of American
trade abroad and replied to publlsho'I
statements of Dr. Charles W. Kllot,
president emeiitus of Harvard, en
dorsing the president's policy.
"Doctor l'.llot pierces the heart of
the matter," Mr. Hughes said, "and
he finds that the record of the ad
ministration means this: 'No Inter
vention by forep of arms to protect
on foreign soil American commercial
and manufacturing .iilvertiirers who
of their own free will have Invested
their money or risked their lives In
foreign pails under alien Jurisdiction.',
"Think of the import of that, you
who ropiosent the beat genius of the
world and itio thinking of using It
abroad," Mr. Hughes added. "Think
of that, you who it Is suggested are
to be asked to finance the chief
undertakings of the world."

president outlining the administra
tion's Ideas with respect to Iho de

terpiise and ii.sseiled thai it was Im
possible lo "square Iho fine words
now used with the actions' of the ad
ministration. "Dollar diplomacy." Mr. Hughes
said, was what encouragement to tbo
development, of Atiieiieun intereits
n broad was dubbed, "something
shockingly reprehensible."
"In oonsoqueiiee I may say," tho
nominee added, "that In respect to
American Interests abioad wo have
bad not only diplomacy without dol
lars, but diplomacy without sense.
"During ihe past three years and a
half one would suppose that any
American who went to foreign lands
to advance American industry and
commerce was presumably a bud fel

make money? Didn't be take his
American enterprise beyond our bor

Let him stow in his own Juice, or let
him come home. That Is the sort if

Mr. Hughes then quoted Doctor
Kllot a nd continued ;
"I do not overlook Doctor Flint's
reference to foroo of arms. We are
desirous no one more than I of
aiding and maintaining the peace of
the world I believe It to bo a mis
take to suppose an adequate policy of
protection to the known rights of
American citizens Is likely to neces
