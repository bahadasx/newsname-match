Ebbets Field, Brooklyn, Oct.
11.—Defeating the Brooklyn Na
tionals by a score of 6 to 2 the
Boston Americans have the
world's series championship al
most within their grasp. The
series now stands Boston Ameri
cans. 3; Brooklyn Nationals, 1.
Dutch Leonard's drop curve and
speed ball was Brooklyn's undoing to
day. After the first inning: when the
home folks nicked him for two runs,
the Boston southpaw held the cham
pions of the National League help
less. Marquard started for Brooklyn
but a base on balls followed by Lewis'
double and Gardner's home run un
settled the Brooklyn pitcher and he
was taken from the box after the
fourth Inning.

Hotel Directors Study
Plans of Architects
Not a minute Is being lost by the
I directors of the Harrisburg Hotel
Company in preparing for the hand
; some structure which will adorn the
; old Opera House corner at Third and
: Walnut streets and prove a fitting cli
max to the activities of the Chamber of
Commerce during the year which is
now drawing to a close.
For three hours yesterday at the
Harrisburg Club the directors listened
to the suggestions and inspected the
tentative plans of two architects who
desire to have a hand in the design
ing of the big building. Other archi
tects will meet the diectors at noon
; day luncheons during the rest of this
week.
E. Z. Wallower, chairman of the
special hotel committee, sent out a
letter to-day advising many who have
not yet subscribed to the stock of the
hotel corporation that an opportunity
would be given this week for investing
in this local security which means
more than a mere financial return.
Friday morning at 9.30 o'clock, re
sponsive to the proclamation of Mayor
Meals, scores of the energetic business
men of the city will gather at the old
Board of Trade building and throw out
a flying squadron to interview all peo
ple who should have a part in the new
I hotel.
