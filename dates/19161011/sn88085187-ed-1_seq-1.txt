Enemies of direct legislation were able
nt the 1915 session of tbe legislature to
pass two hills, which, if they become law,
will cripple disastrously, the initiative, ref
erendum, and recall powers of the people.
These powers, granted by the constitution
of tins slate, cannot be directly taken away
from the people except by a constitutional
amendment. But the legislature, with nia
chiavelan cunning, made no direct attack. It
passed laws which claimed "to facilitate the
initiative power of the people."
No greater falsehood was ever written
in the statute law of this state. Instead
of facilitating, these laws were aimed, by
the reactionary forces?against the peoples
use of their direct legislation powers; they
were intended to hinder the people, to harass
them, to cause them inconvenience and trou
ble.
These laws provided that hereafter ini
tiative, referendum or recall petitions shall
not he circulated; they shall he kept, instead,
at the registration offices; the voter shall
not he permitted to sign any initiative, ref
erendum, or recall petition except at sneh
registration office.
What does this mean? A special trip to
the city hall, if you live in the city, and a
waiting line, perhaps, of half an hour to an
hour before getting a chance to sign. In the
country, it means even greater hardships,
for the registration officers there have no
regular offices or office hours.
In short, these laws are meant to enr-
tail and to end the use nf the people's
direct methods of legislation >)v making it
inconvenient for use. Gov. Lister vetoed
them, but they were passed over his head.
Following that, ")2,000 people in this state
protested by signing a referendum against
these laws going into effect until the people
could have a chance to vote on them Nov. 7.

It's Happening In Every Tacoma Block
Why He Is For
Wilson Now
BY THOtflUi A. KBISOX.
(I ...noiis .Americaii Inventor.)
. I do not believe that there was
ever a president who has had as
many big ques
tions to decide
a s President
Wilson.
Ills decisions
haven't always
pleased me, just
as I suppose
they haven't al
ways pleased
other people,
but when you
look over the
T. A. Edison, record, it is so
good that criti
cism comes close to being noth
ing more than cheap fault-find
ing
A' fool or a coward would have
had the I'nited States iv all sorts
of trouble.
As it is, we are at peace, the
country never was more prosper
ous, aud we have the strength
that comes with honor and in
tegrity of purpose.
Wilson has won victo/ies by
dipioiuucy that are far piTe im
portant to mankind than any vic
tories that we could have won by
war.
1 believe there are times when
a nation lias to fight.
But war for the sake of war or
war for the purposes of conquest
is horrible and unthinkable.
Wilson has now had about four
years of experience, and I think
he has earned faith and trust.
\ do not think it logical or sen
sible to change to an inexperi
enced or untried man Just for the
sake of change.
