Lobeck is the Favorite.
Editor Tribune:
As I travel thru the greater part of
the Seventh District and hear the re
marks made by a number of voters
each day I believe it will interest you
to hear that Hon. E. E. Lobeck seems
to be the favorite of the candidates
now running for Congress. I am now
in what should be Mr. Townsend's
territory. Early this fall voters
around here expressed their desire
to vote for Mr. Townsend but now
some of the same voters I have talk
ed to consider him out of the race and
will vote for Mr. Lobeck.
A GROUP OF PIONEERS OF MINNESOTA
About a half hour ago Mr. Volstead
came into one of the stores here and
shook hands with the merchant, a
shoe salesman (who by the way is
Republican and well acquainted in the
Seventh District), and myself. Af
ter Mr. Volstead left the store the
merchant remarked, "He realizes he's
got a hard fight all right and you can
tell he felt that he's going to lose
all right." The shoe salesman re
marked, "Yes, you bet he's got a fight
on." Their opinions were to the ef
fect that Mr. Lobeck will win.
The towns from Morris to Browns
Valley were recently ridded of their
saloons. In Graceville, Chokio and
every town I have made along this
line I see pictures of Lobeck in stores
on telephone pojes, etc. The Lobeck
cards have hung in stores in this
town over ten days one man told me.

The case of William Peterson ver
sus Dr. B. J. Branton, tried last week
resulted In a verdict of 34,600 for the
plaintiff. The plaintiff based his
claim on the alleged neglect in set
ting an arm. The accident in which
the arm was broken happened the
latter part of October, 1914. The
plaintiff had as his attorneys, C. A.
Fosness of Montevideo, and T. O.
Gilbert of this city. The former con
ducted the examination of the wit
nesses, both direct and cross exami
nation. The latter examined the jur
ors, and made the closing plea to the
jury. Dr. Branton was defended by
C. C. Haupt, of St. Paul, who at one
time, was an attorney in this city. He
was assisted by G. H. Otterness of
this city.
The case was called Wednesday af
ternoon, and all day Thursday and a
good part of Friday was consumed' in
taking testimony. The attorneys
made their pleas Friday afternoon,
followed by the court's charge to the
jury. The jury retired about five o'
clock, and the verdict was reached a
little before eight-thirty that evening.
Among those from other places here
as witnesses, were Drs. Geist of Min
neapolis, Scofleld of Benson and Dan
ielson of Litchfield.
The present week has been con
sumed with one case, or rather two
cases which are being tried under
one with separate verdicts. They
are in the matter of road appeal cas
es, concerning the road which the
county commissioners ordered estab
lished in Lake Lillian and East Lake
Lillian, against which some of the in
habitants thereof are fighting. C. A.
Fosness and G. H. Otterness are re
tained as attorneys for the plaintiffs,
while the county attorney and- T. O.
Gilbert are representing the county.
