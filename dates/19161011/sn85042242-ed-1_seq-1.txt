Rails Will be Removed from Main
Street East of
Fifth
TO PAVE STRETCH
ON FOURTH STREET
Chairman Lewis Says Board is
Ready to Expend $1,C00 on
Line Now
The Capital Street railway hence­
forth will terminate its run at Fifth
street, on Main. At the request ot
the Bismarck city commission the
board of control is removing the rails
from the four blocks on Main street
east of Fifth. There never has been
any great amount of business beyond
Fifth, and for several years the run
to Ninth has been made with empty
cars. Removing the rails from this
section of Main will leave a better
street and will relieve the state of
the expense of paving an eight-foot
strip through these four blocks.
At the request of the press, Chair­
man Lewis of the board of control,
last evening made the following
statement:
Board Favors Paving.
"You ask what action the board of
control will take with reference to
paving that portion of the street car
track provided for in the franchise
under which the car line is operated^
"We are very glad of an oportunity
to answer your question, as there
seems to be an impression among
some of the people interested that
the board are not doing all they can
to assist the enterprising citizens in
carrying out a much needed improve­
ment, which we are satisfied will agj)
much to the growth and development
of the Capital City.
No Funds Available.
"The fact, however, as they actual­
ly exist, are that we have no funds
which are available that can possibly
be used to do any paving, and the
proposition^ will necessarily have to
be put up the legislative assembly
to make ji'. sufficient appropriation to
do the work,. We ,have, however,
$1,00C, which can he used to repair
the track, and we are willing to use
this to ptitP the track to grade, if it
will in any way assist the city com­
mission in furthering the work of
paving.
Commission Without Power.
"Some of your good people have an
erroneous impression that the board
of control could secure financial as­
sistance by making application to the
emergency commission. In this con­
nect^, we wish to state that there
are no funds available which the
emergency commission could appro­
priate for this or any purpose, and
nnder the provisions of the law enact­
ed by the last legislative assembly, if
there were funds, they could not be
made available for the purpose of pav'
ing."
Paving Will Proced.
It is probable thai paving will pro
ceed on Fourth and Main streets
without regard to the state's present
lack of funds, inasmuch as the first
assessment will not fall due until
May 1, 1918, and it is not deemed
probable that the state will forfeit
its franchise and scrap a property in
which it has a great amount of mon
ey invested. It is predicted that some
provision will be made for meeting
the assessments by the next legis
lature.
(GOVERNOR TO AID IN
WILLISTON'S BIG DAY
Governor L. B. Hanna has accept­
ed an invitation from the Williston
Commercial club to deliver the prin­
cipal address at the upper Missouri
metropolis Saturday, October 1,
when "Williston Day" will be cele­
brated. The occasion is planned to
commemorate the progress which
Williston is making the new "White
"Way" will be turned on during the
•course of the day colt and potato
shows will be featured, and there
will be a great get-together supper
in the evening.
ADDITIONAL SEATS FOR
GROWING CITY SCHOOLS
At a meeting of the board of edu­
cation last evening in the high school
building it was decided to purchase
additional seats for the high school
and grades to accommodate the in­
creased attendance.
The board referred the matter of
pupils eating lunches in the building
to Supt. J. M. Martin. A number of
routine matters were considered.
IMPORTANT APPOINTMENTS.
Judge A. A. Bruce of the supreme
court has received notice of appoint­
ment to a number of important na­
tional commissions, including the na­
tional commission on uniform state
laws and the chairmanship of the
committee on marriage and divorce
of the Comparative Law bureau. The
justice has also been made a mem­
ber of the general council of the Am­
erican Ear association.
No Decision
Reached on
U-Boat Raid
Washington, Oct. 10.—Final deci­
sion on the policy of the United
States toward the U-boat raid off the
New England coast has narrowed
down, in the view of the officials here,
to a consideration of whether proper
provision was made for the safety of
the persons taken from the attacked
vessels and left at sea in small boats.
Althought without definite informa­
tion as to the attitude which will be
taken by President Wilson, with whom
the decision rests, high officials are
convinced that only direct evidence
of insufficient steps to protect life
will develop a diplomatic issue over
the incident between the United
States and Germany. A statement of
the facts has been requested from the
American naval officers at Newport.

SCHOOL FIGHT RECEIVES
QUIETUS IN COURT
John Bruegger's bank roll is kept
intact by a decision of the supreme
court handed down yesterday after­
noon, affirming the judgment of Judge
Pollock in the district court of Cass
county in the suit brought by the
Northern Trust co/npany of Fargo
against the prominent Democrat for
the recovery of $5,000.
The action was brought on a prom­
issory note for $5,000 given by Bruag
ger to the News Printing company
in May, 1910. The News Printing
company wap organized to Lake over
the Fargo hewspaper now known as
the Courier-News. It was the under­
standing, Bruegger claimed, when he
gave his note that $50,000 worth of
stock was to be sold, and that his
note would be held in escrow until
the full amount of stock was dispos­
ed of.
The note, it was held, "was deliv­
ered to one Hollister, managing offi­
cer of both the payee and plaintiff
corporations, and under an escrow
agreement, and that the delivery to
the payee by the holder in escrow
was made in disregard of and con­
trary to and without compliance with
the terms of the escrow agreement.
A delivery so made constitutes in
law no delivery of the instrument."
School Fight Quieted.
A school fight which had been bub­
bling for some time in the Wild Kice
School district, near Fargo, received
its final quietus yesterday afternoon,
when the supreme court denied Al­
fred Brunette a writ of certiorari
bringing upon review the action of
Judge Charles A. Pollock of the Cass
county district court in issuing a per­
emptory writ of mandamus, compel­
ling Brunette to turn over to Fred
Provonost and O. Cossette, co-direct­
ors in School District No. 40, the
property of the school of that district.
Question of Recovering Levies on
N. P. Mineral Reserves Now
in Court
A case involving the recovery of
thousands of dollars in current and
deliinquent taxes alleged to be due
Oliver county from the mineral rights
underlying 27,000 acres of Northern
Pacific Railway land, argued by At­
torney George R. Wallace for the
state tax commission, now awaits de­
cision at the hands of Judge Nuessle
of the Burleigh county district court.
A special act provides for the as­
sessment of mineral reserves. When
the Northern Pacific sold surface
rights to its lands in Oliver county,
it reserved the coal and other min­
eral rights, which are assessed at
$50 the quarter. The company has
paid no taxes on these reserves since
claiming that the descriptions
given were not proper and that the
company was not given due notice of
this property's being placed on the
assessment rolls. Oliver county is
now seeking to recover four years*
taxes upon a total assessed valua­
tion of $135,000.
Judge N. C. Young of Fargo is rep­
resenting the railway company, Geo.
R. Wallace the tax commission, and
Robert Dunn, states attorney. Olivet

before Judge Nuessle'on stipulation,

Washington, Oct. 10.—The new
government Alaskan railroad, which
is to link up Seward, at the head oi
Resurrection bay, with Fairbanks, 466
miles in the interior, is nearly one
third completed!
After less than 15 months of actual
construction work, the link connect­
ing the townsite of Anchorage, on
Knik arm, with the edge of tha Mat­
anuska coal fields, is complete'! and
in actual operation.
in addition, the government lias
purchased and rehabilitated the Alas­
ka Northern railroad, running out rf
Seward northward, and is now oper­
ating trains over this section as far
as Kern creek, 71 miles.
From Kern creek northward io An­
chorage, parties are clearing and
grading, and five miles of track has
Deen laid. Commissioner Biggs, with
working parties, has been doing pre­
liminary work on the extreme north­
ern end of the line, working out ol
Fairbanks southward toward tho Ne.
nana coal fields.
Aug. 1, 1SUG, the first Carload of
coal from the rich Matanuska coal
fields was taken out at Doherty's bun­
ker on Moose creek and shipped
down the l'np to Anchorage. The
Alaska railroad commission has con­
tracted for as much coal as he can
produce.
E'y next summer the Matanuska
spur will be ready tp haul out aU the
coal lessees of mines in this field de­
sire to ship.

Jamestown, N. D., Oct. 10.—Declar­
ing it was a pity and shame to see
the American flag in partnership with
the saloon business, Rev. C. E. Cline,
of Portland, Ore., representing the
National Moral, Temperance and Pro
hibitin organization, made the pre­
diction before the Methodist confer­
ence here tonight that following the
second congress, after the one now
adjourned, the United States would
be a saloonless land. National prohi­
bition, he said, would come through
woman suffarge and the non-partisan
vote, which would be universal. He'
declared it was refreshing to come
to a state where prohibition has been
in force 25 years.
"The saloon can't stand the light
said the speaker. "It needs cleaning
under the noon sun." One of the
greatest cleaners, he said, was the
Methodist church. "No one can ween
a Dutchman from his beer any better
than an old fashioned Methodist min­
ister," declared Rev. Cline.
Bishop Cook, who contracted a se­
vere cold in Utah, was unable to at­
tend the conference this evening and
deliver a response to the address of
welcome. His position was taken by
Dr. VV. P. Robertson of Grand Forks.
Mayor Flint gave an address on be­
half of the city Dr. C. S. Phillips, for
the churches of Jamestown Dr. J. G.
Moore, for Bismarck district, and
Rev. T. A. Olsen, for his church here.
More than 150 delegates were regis­
tered tonight.
RECRUITING OFFICE IS
CLOSED—NO BUSINESS
Bismarck's recruiting office, after
several weeks' unsuccessful opera­
tion, has been closed, and Captain
Solen and his staff have been trans
ferred to Fargo. The dearth" of re
cruits is not attributed to a lack of,
patriotism, but rather to the uncer­
tainty surrounding service with First
North Dakota Infantry on the border.
Much of the blame for this condition
is placed by military authorities upon
the letters home, predicting from
week to week an early return of the
troops from the border.

spring, therefore, the opening of the
Alaskan coal resources to public use
will have become an accomplished
fact.
Ever since 1906, when all coal lands
in Alaska were withdrawn from en­
try to save them from monopolization
by the Guggenheim syndicate, devel­
opment has been held up pending
some solution of the question.
In 1914 congress passed and Presi­
dent Wilson signed the Alaskan gov­
ernment railroad act,. This law was
followed by the Alaska coal leasing
act, recommended by Secretary Lane.
March 12, 1914, the first appropri­
ation of $1,000,000 became available
for surveys of the government road.
In May, 1914, President Wilson ap­
pointed the Alaskan engineering com­
mission, to act under Secretary Lane
in building the road. He selected
three eminent engineers, William C.
Edes of California, who was chief en­
gineer of the Northwestern Pacific

Alaska lt years.
Settlers, prospectors and miners
are now pouring into Matanuska and
Susitna valleys. A large proportion
of the vegetables and garden truck
used in Anchorage and the construc­
tion camps are produced by Matan
uska farmers. VVilien the line is open­
ed from the Yukon to the sea, a new
era will have come for Alaska and
the Pacific coast.

It was reported in marine circles

AMERICAN PROPERTY

Adequate Protection of Interests
of This Country Are Es­

Baltimore, Oct. 10.—Charles E.
Hughes, speaking in the great armory
here where Woodrow Wilson first
was nominated for the presidency, to­
night assailed Mr. Wilson's policy as
president toward the promotion of
American trade abroad, and replied
to published statements of Dr.
Charles W. Elliott, president emeri­
tus, of Harvard, endorsing the presi­
dent's policy.
"Dr. Elliott pierces the heart of
the matter," Mr. Hughes said, "and
he finds that the record of the ad­
ministration means this: 'No inter­
vention by force of arms to protect
on American soil American commer­
cial and manufacturing adventurers,
who, of their own free will, have in­
vested their money or risked their
lives in foreign parts under alien jur
isdiction.'
"Think of the import of that, you
who represent the best genius of the.
world, and are thinking of using it
abroad," Mr. Hughes added. "Think
of that, you who, it is suggested, are
to be asked to finance the chief un­
dertaking of the world. Think of
that, merchants, salesmen, tellers,
clerks and dealers, who, in serving
the world take your place remote
from your friends and safeguards, in
communities where revolutions are
frequent and only the respect for
your flag and the power it symbolizes
may stand between you and ruin or
even death!"
"Wo now hear fine wofds as to our
duties to the world.
"But what avails such words when
we do not protect American lives and
American property abroad? The ade­
quate protection of American citi­
zens and their interests abroad, ac­
cording to their rights under, interna­
tional law, is the corner stone of a
policy to promote American enter­
prise throughout the world. This
protection has been deliberately and
deplorably refused by this adminis­
tration."
"A self-respecting policy, worthy
of an American name, maiataining
American honor, assuring protection
to the known rights of American citi­
zens under international law is abso­
lutely necessaryv Tha£ does not
mean war. It means the security of
a self-respecting peace. It rnear/
that regard will be paid to our just
demands."
Mr. Hughes left at 11^:30 o'clock to­
night for points in West Virginia.
CANADIAN PENALIZED FOR
STORY IN BISMARCK PAPER
Ludwig Giesinger, a young farmer
residing at Holdfast, Sask., has been
found guilty in the Saskatchewan su­
preme court at Regina of seditious
libel as a result of an article which
he wrote for the Staatz Ansieger, pub­
lished in Bismarck, in which he said,
among other things, "it is my belief
that if these people (Canadian volun­
teers) only in their dream at night
saw a German soldier, they would die
of fright before morning." It becomes
evident that Canada is maintaining a
strict censorship, and that American
papers are being closely watched.

Long Branch, N. .T., Oct. 10.—Presi­

Lansing discussed in detail at Shadow
Lawn tonight German submarine at­
tacks on merchantmen Sunday off the
New England coast. The conference
lasted late tonight and will continue
tomorrow morning.
It was indicated by officials today
that facts, so far collected through
governmental agencies, have disclos­
ed no grounds for drastic action by
the United States because of the at­
tacks themselves.
Adminisration officials took the po­
sition that the transferring of sub­
marine warfare so close to America's
shores was fraught with grave dan­
ger because of the possibility of mis­
takes being made by submarine com­
manders. Reports that strong senti­
ments exist in Germany for the re­

London, Oct. 10.—Submarines of
belligerent powers visiting American
waters will be accorded the treat­
ment which is their due as warships
under international law.
This fact has been made known to
the Entente allied powers by the
state department at Washington in
answer to an identic memorandum
from Great Britain, France, Russia
and Japan, asking that submarines
of every character be prevented from
availing themselves of the use of neu­
tral waters and that such vessels en­
tering neutral harbors be interned.
President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing have discussed at length the
visit of the German submarine in
waters adjacent to the coast of the
United Staes and continue their con­
ference Wednesday. The German

French Score Big Gain*.
The French troops, fighting south
of the Somme region in France, have
bent back the German lines consid­
erably over a front of about two and
a half miles from the village of Bo
vent to the Clialnes wood, capturing
the village of Bovent, the north and
west outskirts of Ablaincourt and
most of the Chalnes wood. Little
activity was hown on the British
front north of the Somme.
Russians Still Retreating.
In Transylvania, the Germans are
closely pressing the retreating Rus­

The Galician village of Herbutow

and to the north in Volhynia, the
Russians have been driven out of ad­
vance positions northwest of Lutsk.
Along the Struma river, in Greek
Macedonia, the forces of the Teutonic
powers have evacuated the towns of
Chavdar Mah, Ormanli and Haznatar.

among officials.
The arrival of James W. Gerard,
American ambassador to Berlin, in
New York shortly before Mr. Lan­
sing left that city for Shadow Lawn,
added interest to the meeting be­
tween the president and Mr. Lansing
because of the fact that the secretary
saw Mr. Gerard at luncheon in New
York.
In discussing submarine attacks
Sunday, the diplomats referred to
correspondence between the United
States and Great Britain beginning in
1914, in which the American govern­
ment protested against he patroling
of the American coast outside the
three mile limijt-'by British warships.
This was pointed to as providing a
precedent for protesting against the
proximity of German submarines to
the American coast.

Premier Count Seiki Terauchi
Gives Concise Statement of
His Ideas
Tokio, Japan, Oct. 10.—Fears of a
section of the Japanese public, which,
have found an echo in the United
States and China, that the coming in­
to power of the new ministry may
be tantamount to war, were discuss­
ed frankly today by Premier Count
Seiki Terauchi, in giving to the As­
sociated Press the first statement he
has made in regard to the foreign
policy of his administration. The
premier gave expression in a sen­
tence to the spirit which he declared
would animate his dealings with other
nations. It was the assertion that
Japan would not take any aggressive
steps toward the United States or
any other country "so long as Japan's
vital interests and dignity are not in­
fringed."
Will Not "Wave the Sword."
"Any idea that 1 shall 'wave the
sword' while I am prime minister of
Japan is based on a false comprehen­
sion of my career and 'a complete
misconception of the Japanese Em­
pire, its tasks and its hope and ideals
for the future," he said.
The dramatic summons to the pre­
miership of Field Marshal Terauchi,
Japan's dominating military figure,
has excited a discussion overshadow­
ed by no single event in moden Jap­
anese iistorx
In view of the world-wide interest
in the significance of his appointment
and the misgivings it apparently has
caused, the premier, who has long
had the reputation of taciturnity, con-'
sented to break his silence and give
to the world, through the Associated
Press, a general idea of his purposes
and policies. His rugged face, stern,
in repose, relaxed with a smile as lie
said:
Will Promote Friendly Tie*.
"Tell the American people that my
earnest and constant endeavor shall
be to promote the friendly ties which
have bound Japan and America for
half a century.
"Your people know my administra­
tive record in Korea. Because I am
a successful soldier, shall that pre­
vent my being a prudent minister of
state. Say it, repeat it, that. I come
as a satesman, who is seeking the
lasting inerest of my people, not as
a militarist, seeking glorification bjr
the sword."
The premier disclaimed responsible
ity for the interview in New Yorle
with Baron Sakatani, who was quot­
ed as saying the repeal of the Ameri­
can laws regarded by the Japanese
as discriminatory against them was
a matter of "justice and necessity."
He declared emphatically that as pre­
mier he would undertake no new
steps in regard to the so-called Amer­
ican problems, including immigra­
tion. In this respect, he said he
would follow closely the policies of
the outgoing cabinet.
American Interest* Safe.
Though he was unable to dwell on
a detailed program, the premier con­
tinued, he could affirm that America's
interests in China would be harmed
in nowise by Japan, which has no in.
tention of violating China's sovereign*
ty or preventing interested nations
irom having equal opportunities.
"People talk of closing the door,'*
he said. "That is a complete nonpos*
sumus.
'So long as Japan's vital interest
and dignity are not infringed, Japan
will take no aggressive step* against
any nation, especially America."
Ridicules Circulated Rumor.
The premier said he saw no likeli*
hood of active participation in the
war by Japan. He ridiculed the ru«
mor that Japan has designs in re*
gard to the Philippines, saying that
if any power were to be there, he was
glad it should be America.
"My appointment is in exact ae»
cordance with the provisions of the
..apanese constittuion.
"Not revolutionary, not aggressive,
not militaristic, but constructive—
that is my program." declared the
premier in conclusion.
