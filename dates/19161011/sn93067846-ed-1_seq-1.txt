FIRST CHARLESTON PRIMARY
TRIAL IN PROGRESS.
Trstlroouy of Eight Witnesses Heard
in Day Devoted to Taking Evidence
?Eleven Other Cases.
Charleston, Oct. 6.?The .first of the
election cases growing out of the
shooting affair on October 15, 1915, in
the city Democratic executive commit?
tee room, in which Sidney J.
Cohen, a newspaper re Dort er, was
killed and four other men wound?
ed came up In the court of
general sessions today. Judge Rice
presiding and Solicitor Henry repre?
senting the State, when Henry J.
Brown became defendant on charges
of assault and battery with Intent to
kill on W. B. Wl agate and carrying
concealed weapon:!.
The entire day, with an intervening
recess, was occupied In taking testi?
mony, four witnesses for the State and
four for the defense being heard, and
court adjourned 'at 6 o'clock until to?
morrow morning, the jury < being
locked up In the court house for the
night. It Is expected that the case
will be concluded In tomorrow's head?
ing.
A large crowd was on hand, keep?
ing excellent order.
Judge -Rice rv led strictly against
any testimony that tended to bring in
the political phanes of the case and
much time was taken up by counsel
for the defense, Atford Huger and
Lionel Legge, in arguing points of
evidence. Numerous objections by
the State, for the most part sustained
by the court, and equally numerous
exceptions by the defense, formed a
feature of the legal battle. W. E.
Wlngate, chief prosecuting witness,
was on the stand an hour and a-half.
He was shot in che head at the out?
break and was in a hospital for six
weeks afterwards.
Wlngate Is slai.ed for trial later on
charges similar to those against
Brown, and In that trial. Brown will

shooting last fall, when for three
days evidence was taken, without es?
tablishing responsibility for the death
of Sidney J. Cohen was adduced inso?
far as it applied to the case up for
trial now., Brown la to take the stand
tomorrow, when for the first time a
statement will be heard from him as
to what occurred In the committee

|came a death-dealing demon no' sooner than she had sped past
the three-mile limit today.
She first sighted the American freighter Kansan making
her way through the dim light of early morning from New
York to Boston.
Captain Rose, the suave and keen-eyed commander of the
U-53, personally stood on the bridge and handled the Kansan.
The freighter was not detained kmg. After inspecting the ship's
papers Captain Rose apologized and allowed the vessel to pro?
ceed. The Kansan was fifty miles away fr?m the scene when
her wireless operator picked up* the dreaded S. 0. S. It was
from the British ship Westpoint.
From station to station along the
coast the distress call was repeated.
The captain of the Kundin instantly
heeded the call. It was followed by a
message briefly saying the Westpoint
had been attacked by a submarine and
was in danger of sinking. Her crew
and passengers had taken to the
boats, ready to put to sea.
Twenty minutes after the call was
flashed to the naval training station
here the torpedo boat destroyer Jar
vis had left her moorings and was
headed for the open sea. She was
rapidly followed by the other boats of
the flotilla. Crowding their boilers,
the fleet navy boats started on the
horrible journey of mercy.
But the Kansan was first to reach
the rapidly sinking steamer. She beat
the navy boats in the first race in
American waters to save the lives of
persons imperiled by the ruthless un?
der-sea warfare.
Two hours later the U-53, still
loitering in the lanes of steamships on
their way to Boston or foreign ports,
sighted the British freighter Strath-1
dene, bound from New York to Bor?
deaux.
The Strathdenc is said to have been
loaded with munitions of war for the
allies. She proved eusy prey for Cap?
tain Hose and his men. Twenty min?
utes alter the crew had taken to the
open sea in small boats she lifted her
nose towards the sky and sank. Pluck
| ily battling the waves, the crew of the
Strathdene managed to reach the Nun
tuckel shoals lightship,
There seventeen of them were found
by the destroyer Batch.
Leaving the balance of rescue work
to her sister ships, the Batch was or?
dered to return here by Admiral
Knight
It was soon after B oYloek that u
Wireless call at the training station
told of the torpedoing of another
ship. U was the Red Cross liner
gtephnno, bound to New VorK front
Halifax.
The Btephano received her vital
blow m 4:80 o'clock, it wan more
than an hour later before the word
had been received here. In rapid sue
cession tonight the wireless sputtered
Its tales of disaster to the other ships.
The Kingston was the first to sink.
Then followed the Blomerdijk and
Knudsen.
Naval officers say the U-53 had
only six torpedoes aboard when she
left here yesterday. Normally the sub?
marine carried eight, but two of these
were spent on the voyage to these
shores. Captain Rose himself said
his submersible carried but eight when
she left Wilhelmshaven, but ho had
nothing to say by way of explanation.
Three full divisions of the Atlantic
destroyed flotilla are engaged in the
work of rescue. Admiral Knight, com
mandant -of the Newport navy yard,
has given orders that all survivors
picked up by navy boats be brought
here. Those aboard the Kansan are
being taken to Boston.
A wireless has been received from
I
the destroyer Drayton saying she is
returning under forced draught with
68 survivors of the Bloomerdijk and
Knudsen. Her commanders expect to
reach dock between 1 and 2 o'clock
tomorrow morning. Admiral Knight
has made every arrangement to take
care of those in need of medical at?
tention. From the moment the U-53
atartled the natives of this city by her
unexpected appearance In Xarragan
sett Kay yesterday and was picked up
by U. S. submarine D-2, the land
wires and wireless instruments have
been crowded with messages passing
back and forth between the Newport
naval station and Washington.
Admiral Austin M. Knight and Rear
Admiral Albert Qleaves, chief of the
destroyer flotilla, have kept the navy
department Informed of everything
that came to their ears regarding the
Gorman Visitor. It is presumed the
two admirals received Specific instruc?
tions as to their course in certain
emergencies.
it was freely commented upon that
for the Urst time known every de?
stroyer anchored here was kept under
full steam during last night. Whether
this had any significance or not
would ma be Admitted by naval odl
oers tonight.
CHARLESTON JURY MKS.
MISTRIAL ORDERED IN "ELEC
Nearly Twenty-four Hours Spent in
Vain Attempt to Reach Decision.
Charleston, Oct. 8.?After being
out nearly 24 hours the jury in the
Brown case, which opened In the
court of general sessions Friday
morning, was discharged this after?
noon at 5 o'clock, Judge Rice order?
ing a mistrial. The Jury retired Sat?
urday at 7 a. m. with the evidence
in this first "election case." At 11:30
o'clock it had not reached agree?
ment and was locked up to spend the
second night in the court house.
When it was seen this afternoon that
there was no hope of agreement
Judge Rice ordered a mistrial.
Men of both factions in municipal
politics were on the Jury in about
equal proportions.
Solicitor Henry tonight would make
public no inkling of his plans as to
the other 12 election cases pending
and which he came here specially to
prosecute. It is probable, however,
that failure to secure a verdict in the
Brown case may mean a postpone?
ment of the others to another term.
It was the general belief she would
head for Halifax and the uppermost
part of the St. Lawrence there to in?
tercept, if possible, the troop ships
carrying Canadian contingents to the
front. This belief was predicated upon
operations against troop ships when
the British were trying to force their
way through the Dardanelles.
Thus it was with surprise and as?
tonishment that naval officers learned
the tiny man-of-war had only delayed
until she was safely past the three
mile limit before she bagan her war?
fare against enemy vessels.
Late tonight naval officials admitted
the destroyers sent to sea were not
alone on a mission of mercy. Their
decks were cleared for action and each
commander had strict instructions to
determine that the utmost neutrality
had lreen^ato^
any of the attacks were perpetrated
inside the three mile limit, but the
curious line of the coast here gives
?Ise to the gravest speculation. The
ships went to the bottom, it is be?
lieved, within a radius of five miles.
It is believed this circle of activity
centered ten miles south of the Nan
lucket lightship.
From all along the coast came word
jf mysterious messages being relayed
between the French and British war?
ships rushing to this vicinity. None
has given an inkling of her where?
abouts, but within 24 hours a cordon
of battle gray steel will be thrown
about the waters for miles up and
down the coast.
These patrollng vessels scattered
between Trinidad and Halifax have
been converging on the waters of
Narragansett Bay since they were
apprised by wireless yesterday of the
U-53's audacious appearance.
Late this afternoon a lookout In the
tower of the United States coast
guard station at Prices Neck saw
what he believed to be the pilot of
the approaching Meet. The vessel was
identilied as the French cruiser Con
This information was Immediately
convi 'ed by Captain Chauncey iven
yon, cemmanding the station, to the
commanding admirals. They decided,
however, that the liotilla needed no
reinforcements at the present time.
The largest United States vessel in
the harbor now is the scout cruiser
Birmingham, flagship of the destroyer
flotilla. Despite the boas:, of Captain
Hose that the C-53 had fuel and pro?
visions aboard to last for a thren
months' cruise, local submarine ofli
rers believe the vessel was ready to
descend upon her prey and then make
.i quick dash for home.
These experts place her cruising
radius at 5,0u0 miles, as far as fuel
supply is concerned. Thor? v ere fc\N
who doubted tonight but that she was
already scooting across th-y Atlantic
on her way to her home port.
When the news of the Intercepting
of the K&nsan had been conveyed to
him, Adlmarl Knight went directly to
his office in the ear collie. He rc
r.fined there all forenoon.
"We work all the time," was his an?
swer to newspaper men who suggested
it was both odd and unusual that he
should be at bis desk on Sunday in?
stead of remaining at home.
"Sundays and holidays are all the
same to US," he added.
About noon the second wireless call
came from the lightship. This v as the
message the admiral's operator read
from the intermittent Hashes.
"Steamship Westpoint, nationality
unknown, in distress ten miles south
