Brooklyn. N. Y.. Oct. 1- -When the cur
tain of events droppell upon the third
game of the 1916 world's series at Ebbets
Field, Flatbush. it was Ivan Olson's ter
rific wallop in the fifth that had the Dodg
ers still in front of the Boston Red Sox,
ry a score of 4 to I
It was Ivan Olson's smash that stopped
the apparent rout of the Dodgers and put
them back in the battle for the baseball
championship after they had lost two
games in Boston and seemed to be on the
run. The Red Sox still hold a one-game
mnargin, but few of the 2000 chilled fans
in the windswept stands in Flathush to
day doubt that the Dodgers have a good
chance to take the series.
Ivan Olson's clout practically drove
Young Carl Mays, the right-hander with
the weird underhand delivery, from the
game. lie tinhlhed out the fifth, but in
the next inning Bill Carrigan, manager of
the Red Sox. sent Olaf Henricksen up to
bat for him.
It was Non I a-a MayS who stopped
the rally of the Dlodrers In the ninth in
ning o~ th first game of the series at
Boston Saturda,. and it was after that
game that thou-ando of Brooklyn fans

NOTE TO KAISER
PLAN OF WILSON
President and Lansing Discuss
U-Boat Warning.
(by the Internattemal News Service.
Asbury Park. N. J., (-Ot. lo.--Pr-sident
vilson and Se.cretary 1a sing, of tih
4tate I'eparltwnt , k-pt th ihts burn
ing at Shadow L.awn until a late hout
tonight while they discussed the situation
created by the active operations of Ger
man submarines in American waters.
The conferen e is expected to result
in a note to Germany suggesting that
a continuation of the submarine warfare
so close to thy shores of the i'nited
States might easily endanger the exist
ing friendly relations between the two
countries.
Such a comnuni at ion would serve two
purposes, it is said;
1. Germany would be asked by indirec
tiotn to recall the submarines from this
side of the Atlatit c Ocean.
2. The Kaiser's government would be
warned that the loss of a single American
tife as a tesult of a violation of the
agtrement on cruiser warfare would mean
a definite break in dipiornati, relations.
The note would not have a baits in
international law. Neither would it be
an in-nuation that Germany has so far
violated any right by placing swpma
rines off the New England coaP and
..king British vese!-, It would be In
tended as a 1reeaution against acci
dents such as often l,-ad to war.
It WAS pointed out by persorns who talk
ed with President Wilson today that a
communication somewhat similar in char
arter and purpse was Sent to Great
tritin me than a %ear ago when a
patrol of allied warshIps was estai-lish'd
jt outside Ncw Y- rk hartor.
PIr o d. It Wilson L- said t, ht' i
iterated today th,, opirion that the corn
mand, r. of the German subniarincs now
!r I I Fvicinity have strictly observed
all ,stisng agreements.
Tie is known, however, to view the sit
utlotn with alarm.
