I Begin an Extensive
I Invasion of Rumania
II British troops arc now within two
miles of Seres, one of the most impor
tant towns in the strip of Greek Mace
donia occupied by the Bulgarians
shortly before Rumania entered the
war. The capture of two more towns
east of the Struma river also is an
nounced in an official British state
ment from Saloniki.
The sustained character of the of
fensive on the part of the British
troops which forced a passage of the
Struma indicates that after several
momentary efforts, serious operations'
have been undertaken on the Mace
donian front.
Heavy Fighting Under Way.
Not only in the Struma region, but
in the territory south and southeast
of Monastir where the Serbians have
. been making important progress re
cently, heavy fighting is under way.
It is probable the operations are be
ing undertaken partly to relieve the
pressure on the Rumanians, who are
being hard pressed by the Bulgarians
and their Austrian and Gorman allies.
In Transylvania the troops of General
von Falkenhayn are forcing back the
Rumanians rapidly and are now close
to the Rumanian border at some
points.
The repulse of Russian attacks in
Galicia is reported by the Austrian
war office, but few details are given
of the great battle now in progress for
possession of Lemberg.
I German troops have captured the
; '' village of Herbutov, on the Narayuvka
, 1 river, southeast of Lemberg.

No Drastic Action
Needed.
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 11. Secre
tary Lansing, declining to discuss his
conference last night with President
Wilson on the German submarine ac
tivity off the American coast, left
here today for Washington. The sec
retary and Mr. Wilson were up early
this morning and talked briefly be
fore the former's departure.
Officials here declared there was
no statement to be made regarding
Mr. Lansing's visit beyond the. fact
that he and tho president had dis
cussed the submarine situation very
fully. It was reiterated that on tho
basis of reports so far received no
grounds had been found for drastic
action. So far as the government
now knows, it was said, the rules of
international law were followed In
tho recent submarine attacks.
Tho president has received many
telegrams urging that some action
be taken to prevent a repetition of
submarine attacks near the American
coast.
Mr. Wilson planned to leave Shad
ow Lawn at 1'50 o'clock this after

INSURANCE FOR
WAGEJARNERS
American Electric Railway
Association in Convention
Strongly Urge Compul
sory Law.
Atlantic City, N. J., Oct. 11. In a
report submitted today to the conven
tion of the American Electric Railway
association in session here a special
Investigating committee strongly rec
ommended compulsory life, health and
nccident Insurance tor all American
wage earners. The committee which
consists of E. W. Rice, president of
the General Electric company; H. E.
Bradlee, a Boston banker, and James
D. Mortimer, president of a Now York
bank, has undertanen to cover the
same ground as that studied by the
federal industrial relations commis
sion and to Investigate the economic
status of tho wage earner and his
relations with the employer.
The report submitted today was
confined to insurance for wage enrn
ers. One of the opinions reached by
the committee was that tho compul-
BASEBALL VETERANS DIRECT SEASON'S BIGGEST SPORT AFFAIR
Bill Carrigan (left) and Wilbert Robinson.
Bill Carrigan and Wilbert Robinson, managers of the Boston Red Sox and the Brooklyn Dodgers, are the
prominent figures in the big baseball series. Carrigan has the confidence of last season's victory to inspire
him, while Robinson has a part in a world's series for the first time. Just the same, Robinson's veteran experi
ence in the came and his shrewd baseball brains should make him equal to Carriean's cleverest tactics.
story social insurance system of Ger
many is the only one that provides
reasonably adequate protection for all
workers.
"Voluntary insurance systemc have
failed to carry life insurance protec
tion generally into the lower wage
levels where It Is most needed," said
the report, "In the absence of com
pulsory regulations the American
workingman will go without life in
surance," the report says.
State Insurance, the report declares,
"has not been a conspicuous success,"
and labor unions, as now organized,
do not and cannot be expected to pro
vide tho insurance needed by the wage
wage earners and their families.
Public Pension System.
Regarding the public pension sys
I tern, the report says, "the failure to
I make adequate provision for the ac
fcruing liabilities under these pension
plans-has been the universal short
coming of such administration."
Greatest progress has been made In
procuring social insurance for electric
railways' employes, the report says,
through mutual benefit associations
supported and managed jointly by
employers and employes. After de
claring that compulsory Insurance for
American workers Is a "necessary and
probably development In the near fu
ture," the report says:
"The Imperative need of every wage
earner for such forms of social in
surance as compensation for indus
trial accidents, life insurance, health
insurance and old ago pensions Is
now generally conceded. The question
arises as to the agency best suited
to provide this portection. Whatever
Bystem of compulsory insurance is
provided in this country will recog
nize tho employes' mutual benefit as
sociation and moBt of It will be man
aged by Joint boards of employes and
employers In tho several industries
under regulations made and enforced
by law."
The committee, of which Mr. Mor
timer Is chairman, plans to devote Its
attention during the coming year to
old age pensions, minimum wage, em
ployes' thrift and the productivity
basis of wages.

Destroyers Return From
Search for Kingstonian's
Boats Submarine
Missing.
Newport, R. I., Oct 11. The United
States destroyers which havo been
searching for the crew of the King
stonian, reported sunk by a German
submarine off the Nantucket shoal
lightship on Sunday, last, returnee'
here today. None of them reported
having found any trnco of the Klng
stonians boats. The sea was very
and the weather cold.
What became of the submarine, aft
er she completed her raid on British
nnd neutral steamers Sunday night,
remained a mystery today. The move
ment of allied warships which sup
posed to have increased the vlgllanco
of their patrol off tho coast after ro-
celvlng word of the sinking of six
steamers also was unknown here.

FRENCH MAKING !
COALTAR DYES,
Material Obtained From CoaJ
Deposits in Valleys of Rhine
and Loire Rivers.
New York, Oct. 11. The French
people are making their own coal tar
dyes from coal deposits in the valleys
of the Rhine and the Loirs rivers, says !
McDougall Hawkes, president of tho
French Institute in America, who has
just arrived hero from France. Iron
deposits have been discovered in Brit
tany and Anjou and waterpower from
the Alps and the Pyrennes is being
used for its manufacture, he adds.
"The change from hand to mechani
cal manufacturing methods In France
will create a big demand for new im
plements which will be a factor in fu
ture American exports," said Mr.
Hawkes. "The machinery used in the
war will not be scrapped, but will bo
utilized In the pursuits of peace.
American rroducers should carefully
consider the direction of this develop
ment with a view to future exchanges
between the two countries."
REGiSTRATlDW WILL
BE CHECKED UP
TDMDRRDW
Results of the registration of voters
in Ogden city and Weber county which
began yesterday and will continue all
of today, probably will not be known
until tomorrow night, D. D. McKay.
I chairman of the Weber county Dem
j ocratlc campaign committee, stated
I this morning.
Leaders of both parties, he said,
will start making a check tomorrow
morning. Reports from some of the
places of registry yesterday were to
the effect that the registration was
fair. It was expected that there will
be a heavier registration today.
OPENING OF STREETS
DECLARED TO BE
TOO EXPENSIVE
Recommendation that some definite
policy should be established with ref
erence to opening of streets or ave
nues In cities of Utah Is contained
in a report on the opening of the pro
posed Porter avenue from Twenty
ninth to Thirtieth Btreets by Capt.
B. T. Hulanlskl, city attorney, to the
city commission at the session this
morning.
In the report the' city attorney con
tends that expenses attending tho op
ening of a street or avenue are too
high. He asserts that the matter of
reducing the advertising bill of 150
for publishing notices twenty days be
fore the opening of the street project
should be taken up by the legislature,
stating that notices of intention pub
lished twice at opportune times before
the date set for starting work on the
improvement would be sufficient and
less expensive.
In regard to opening highways, he
suggests that persons interested in
such project take the first steps,
first by acquiring title to the prop
erty in question that might be in
the line of the proposed street and
then deeding it over to the city.
In referring to the proposed Por
ter avenue the report states that from
the report of the city engineer he
found that the avenue had been op
ened from Thirtieth street south, but
there is no record that it had been
opened between Twenty-ninth and
Thirtieth streets. The territory
through which the avenue Is described
fronts on Twenty-ninth street, be
tween Adams and Jefferson avenues.
The report was referred to Com
missioner Flygare of the street de
partment The commission also received a
communication from Julian Bamber
ger, stating that tho company could
not begin its work in the Lincoln ave
nue street paving, which is known as
paving district No. 122, until next
spring, as the company was unable
to get the necessary material from
the manufacturers. The communica
tion was ordered filed.
Claims of Thomas Lundy, oil Inspec
tor, for all Inspection fees amounting
to $4.81 were allowed.
VOTING MiClES IT
HEADQUARTERS OF
PITIES
With tho final decision of tho coun
ty commissioners not to discard voting
machines as urged in petitions pre
sented by various political parties at
recent sessions, leaders at the Demo
cratic and Republican headquarters
today Instructed all "field workers" to
emphasize tho importance of an ac
quaintance with the mechanism of
tho machine to insure the desired re
sult in making personal calls upon
voters.
luacnines installed at tne ncaaquar
ters of both parties in the Dec-Eccles
building, in the city hall and county
buildings and at other places are be
ing used constantly In practical dem
onstrations that the "people may
know." Instruction in tho use of the
machine is afforded, persons compe
tent in performing that particular
function being close about to give
help If needed.
Pnrty leaders say that, inasmuch
as one experiment with the machine
is not sufficient to- gain an adequate
knowledge of how It should be oper
ated, all voters In tho city and county
should make it a point to vIbR head
quarters at least three or four times
before election day, or as many times
as Is necessary.
This argument Is advanced in sup
port of the theory that practice makes
perfect and that the samo principle
can be applied with effectiveness with
tho voting machines.
1 WORLD SERIES 12 M. STANDARD OFFICE
FIVE ABANDONED
BOATS FOUND
-
May Be Possible Trace of
British Steamship Kings
tonian, Torpedoed
Sunday.
Newport, Oct. 11. The finding of
five abandoned ship's boats in good
condition by the Spanish steamer An
tonio Lopez, reported in a radio mes
sage relayed to the naval station hero
today by tho Nantucket Shoals light
ship, was considered in naval circles
as suggesting a possible trace of tho
crew of the steamship KIngstonian, re
ported torpedoed by a German subma.
rino on Sunday.
Search for the crew has been sus
pended by the naval authorities, who
doubted whether the submarine's vic
tims Included any vessels other than
those whose crews had been brought
to port. By somo the message was
held to bo far from conclusive evi
dence that a sixth vessel was sunk,
the suggestion being made that tho
boats may have been those from
which a crew now ashore was taken.
Tho statement in tho message that
the boats were in good condition was
as an indication that no harm fell to
those who had been In them. If the
boats were thoso of the Kingstonian
it was thought her crew probably was
picked up by an eastbound vessel,
which will land them on the other
side.

COW IS A LOSER
ON CHEAP IILK
High cost of living In the barnyard
has made It imperative to raise the
price of milk. The cow can no longer
furnish milk at the old-time price and
soon will demand 25 cents a gallon for
her product. It is too bad, but it has
to be done, as all things find a level,
especially in the food world of prices.
Dairymen say that the excessive
cost of hay and other foodstuffs which
the cow consumes, starvation stares
them In the face unless the price of
milk bo Increased. They have con
sidered the question from every .ingle
and have come to tho conclusion that
It was a question of life or death with
them; It was necessary to either raise
the price of milk and heap tho burden
on the consumer or get out of the
dairy business.
A few days ago one of the dairymen
said he thought the price, should be
regulated according to the grade, of
tho milk, but the idea was knocked
into smithereens when anotherdairy
iman said that tho cow giving inferior
milk cost as much to feed as tho cow
giving the better grade, and that to
keep up the business all grades of
milk should sell for more money, at
least 33 1-3 per cent more. So, It has
been agreed upon and the exalted
price will go into effect about Octo
ber 15.

"Our friends, on the other side, talk i :
about their policy, particularly in 1 j
Mexico, as though it were a policy of : , ; .H

has not been a policy of peace. It -
has been a policy of destruction of ut

accorded. I jH
Mr. Hughes spoke for the protective
tariff, declaring that in its appllca- (j

"I am not opposed to the prin- i

he said. "I favor that principle. What

Its power, official and moral, in the ; H
presence of the demands of force in

Mr. Hughes assailed the administra

the Democratic party four years ago
had arraigned the Republicans for
extravagance and then "proceeded 'to
break the record for extravagance." j'
