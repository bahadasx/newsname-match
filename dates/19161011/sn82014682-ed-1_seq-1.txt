BROOKLYN, N.;Y.. Oct. 11. Boston
hammered two Brooklyn pitchers out
of the box this ' afternoon , . in the
fourth game Of the world series, and
the Red Sox captur their third game
by a score of 6 to 2.: Boston had the
"breaks," luck and punch at the fin

hot'water-at all times. ' " ."
If yon take a glance at the hit col

ADAMSON EIGHT-HOUR LAW
IS PROVING BOOMERANG
Heard Hughes Speak in Seattle
and Was Impressed With His
Sincerity and Forcefuhiess
Victory for Charles E. Hughes In
November Is foreseen - by Frank C.
Atherton. who, with Mrs. Atherton
and their children, returned on . the
Matsonla today from an extended stay
on the Pacific coast. :
Most of the summer and early fall
Mr. Atherton spent in the Northwest
particularly Seattle, where he heard
Mr. Hughes deliver an able, forceful
address' and one which, he thinks
should impress the presidential candt
date upon thinking men.
The local Impression that the
president is losing support because
of the Adamson eight-hour bill for
railroad employes is confirmed by Mr,
Atherton, who says the bill is proving
a boomerang for the administration."
Speaking of political conditions and
prospects on the mainland, as Viewed
on the West Coast, he said this morn
ing: . " ;-. - --: v -

I believe the election will be a close
one. but I also believe that Hughes
will win by a fair majority. -"People
