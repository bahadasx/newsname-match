To Float New War Loan.
Berlin, via London, Oct. 11.—A bill
for a new war credit of 12,000,000,000
marks will shortly be submitted to the
reichstag. The bill has only precau
tionary character, but is deemed neces
sary because the margin between the
credit granted June, 1916, totaling 52,
000,000,000 marks, and the 47,000,000,000
marks raised by the five war loans
has become rather small. The new
war loan Is not expected to be floated
before next spring.
Subscriptions from neutral countries
to the fifth German war loan, Says the
Overseas News Agency, surpassed
those received for the fourch issue. The
German newspapers .comment with
satisfaction on this fact which they
say proves the confidence of neutral
countries in German power and effi
ciency. A dispatch from Warsaw says
that tie Eastern Bank received sub

New York, Oct. 11.—Interest In the
world's aerlea showed no signs of flag
ging today as the crowds gathered for
the fourth game of the series at Brook
lyn. The occasion was given an added
xoat for the Brooklynites, their fa
vorites needing to capture the event
to even up the series.
The throngs started for Ebbets field
at an early hour. Hope, not untinged
with confidence,
was
the prevailing
sentiment In the Brooklyn camp. To
day Robinson's men went into the
struggle with the feeling that they had
found themselves and could repeat yes
terday's victory. Yesterday they swung
their *bats to good effect and had
steadied their fielding play, giving thetr
pitchers faultless support while show
ing all round good judgment In tha
field and at bat.
From the Boston viewpoint, also, the
situation was satisfactory. There was
no loss of confidence by the Red Sox
players or their-adherents. In th* trust

Brooklyn Plsyara Confident.
EJbbets Field, Brooklyn, Oct. 11.—
Spurred on by Tuesday's victory the
Brooklyn Nationals resumed their
counter charge against the Boston
Americans in the fourth game of the
world's series.
"Our boys are batting at last," said
Manager Robinson, of Brooklyn, Just
before. having a war council with his
men before the contest* "We are a
batting team. We have looked overall
the Red Sox pitchers except Leonard
and we now know what to expect. I'll
agree Boston has some fine hurlers, but
my men feel they can best th%m."
Boston regarded yesterday's defeat
as nothing more than what might be
expected to happen along the course of
a seven-game series.
"The Red Sox play best In a pinch,"
said Jack Barry. "We have the edge
and will hold it Everyone knows
what the club has done when it faced
a critical situation."
Cloudless But Cool.
Brooklyn did not mind the cold. The
crowds that came early to the field
would have felt comfortable on an ice
berg. The crack of the Brooklyn bats
that toppled over Boston was still
echoing, over the field this morning and
the crowd was in high humor over the
day's prospects for another win over
the Red hosed players from Boston.
The temporary stands in left were
the first to fill. Not a cloud flecked
the sky and there was enough autumn
haze to kill the high sky that proved so
troublesome to outfielders playing tha
sun fleld. It grew warmer toward
game time.
Marquard and Leonard.
Brooklyn took an hour's batting,
practice using three pitchers, Appleton
ahd Dell, right handers, and Southpaw
Mails, ditchers Cheney, Pfeffer and

Newport, R. I.. Oct. 11.—The finding
of five abandoned ship's boats in good
condition by the Spanish steamer An
tonio Lopez, reported in a radio mes
sage relayed to the naval station here
today by the Nantucket shoals light
ship, was considered in navy circles as
suggesting a possible trace of the crew
of the steamship Kingstonian, reported
torpedoed by a German submarine on
Sunday. Search for the crew had been
suspended by naval authorities. By
some the message was held to be far
from conclusive evidence that a sixth
vessel was sunk, the suggestion being
made that the boats 'may have been
from a crew now ashore.
The statement In the message that
the boats were In good condition was
accepted as an indication that no harm
fell to those who had been in them. If
the boats were those of the Kingston
ian, it was thought her crew was picked
up by an east-bound vessel which will
land them on the other side.
No Trace Found by U. S. Snips.
The United States destroyers which
have been searching for the crew of the
British steamer Kingstonian, sunk by a
submarine Sunday, returned here today.
Nona reported having found any trace
of the ship's boats. The sea was very
rough and the weather cold.
What became of the submarine after
completing the raid remained a mystery
today. The movement of allied war
ships which are supposed to have in
creased their vigilance off the coast,
also was unknown here.

E. Hughes told an audience at -the sta
tion hero today that la his stand for
the protection of American Uvea, prop
erty or commerce ho had "no agree
ments with anybody."
'1 stand for American rights thruout
the world, without fear or favor," said
Mr. Hughes, "I have no understanding,
no agreements, no intrigues with any
body, but I stand for tho Interests of
the United States and the protection of
American lives, American .property and
American commerce thruout tho world.
"Our friends on the other side talk
about their policy, particularly In iMex
loo, as tho It were a policy of peace.
It has not been a policy of peace. It
has been a policy ot destruction of tho
lives and property of American citi
zens because of the withdrawal of pro
tection that should have been aocord-t
ed."
Ataalls Administration.
Mr. Hughes spoke for the protective
tariff, declaring that in its application
he would not "aid any particular aort
of American cltisens at tho exponas of
the others."
The nominee assailed the admin is
tratlon again for the enactment of tha
Ad&moon law.
'7 am not opposed to tho principle of
an eight-hour work day," he said. "I
favor that principle. What am op
posed to Is government by holdup.
What I am opposed to Is having tho
government abdicate Its power, official
and moral, in the presence ot tho So
man ds of force, instead of knowing
what is right and then doing it" ,•
He assailed tho administration for
extravagance, asserting that the dem
ocratic party four years ago had ar*v
ralgned the republicans for extravay
gance, and then proceeded to tireak tha
record for extravagance.

"Think of the import of that, yoo
who represent the best genius of tho
world and are thinking of using it
abroad. Think of that, you who, It is
suggested, are to be asked to finance'
tho chief undertakings of the world.
Think of that, merchants, salesmen,

tions are frequent and only tho respect

bolizes may stand batween you and
ruin, or even death."
"Molaseea to Catoh Flioa."
Mr. Hughes read the demooratlo
platform plank of 1912, declaring for
the protection of American rights
abroad, and asked If it were "molasses
to catch fllea." He declared that the
protection It promised had been "de
liberately anJ deplorably refused." He
quoted from a recent speech of the
president outlining the administration's
ideas with respect to the development
abroad of American enterprise and as
serted that It was Impossible to
"square the fine words now used with
the actionr"
ci
-4M
the administration.
"Dollar diplomacy," Mr. Hughea
said, "was what encouragement tp ttte^J
development of American Interests
abroad was dubbed, something shock
ingly reprehensible."
"In conaequenco I may say," tho
nominee added, "that In respect
to'
American Interests abroad we have
had not only diplomacy without dol-"
lars but diplomacy without mnse.
During the last three years and &
half one would suppose that any
American who went to foreign lands
to advance American Industry and
commerce was presumably, a bad fel
low who had lost his rights. Protect
him? Why, didn't he go abroad to
make money? Didn't he take his Amer
lean enterprise beyond our borders?
What a shameloss proceeding! Let hlm|
stew in his own juice! Or let him corned
home! That Is the sort of encourage
ment Americans have had."
