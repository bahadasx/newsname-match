(Special Dispatch ta West Virginian)
MOMANTOWN, W. Va., October
11?The West Virginia Equal Suf(rage
Association has repeatedly called
attention to the fact that when the
vote is extended to women in this
state they will not be required to serve
on juries. Such service is prohibited
by both {he statute law and the Coustltution.
The constitutional probibilion
extends to jurors In trials (or
crimes and misdemeanors, while the
statutory inhibition covers jurors in
all Oases.
In order that this matter may be
made perfectly clear to the voters,
and that an. authoritative statement
of the Constitution and o (the statutory
law may be presented to the people
of West Virginia, an opinion was
asked of Judge Frank Cox, of Morgantown,
former judge of the State Court
of Appeals. To this request Judge
Cox has kindly replied as follows:
"Mrs. Lenna Lowe Yost,
"President W. Va., Equal Suffrage
Association.
"Dear Madam: "You'asked me to
state the law to you relative to the
matter of service on juries by women
in the event the Equal Suffrage
Amendment carried in West
Virginia. The West Virginia Constitution,
Article ill, Section 14.
provides:
"Trials of crimes and misdemeanors,
unless herein otherwise
provided, shall be by a jury of
twelve men, public, without unreasonable
delay, and In the county
where the alleged offense was
commlttod. unless uoon netitinn
of the accused, and for good cauBe
shown, ft is removed to some other
county." ..
"The statute. Section 460,
Hogg's Annotated Code. 1913,
provides: "All persons who are
twenty-one years of age and not
over slaty, and who are citizens of
this stato, shall be liable to serve
as Jurors, except as hereinafter
provided."
"Section 4641 makes certain exemptions
from jury service by
men occupying certain avocations.
"Therefore, you will see that In
all trials of crimes and misdemeanors
women could not serve
as jurors unless the Constitution
should be amended to so provide.
In other cases women could not
serve as jurors unless the statute
were changed so as to Include
women.
"It Is, therefore, true that as
the law now stands there could be
uu jury service uy women in W681
Virginia even 1( Equal Suffrage
becomes a law.
"Very respectfully,
(Signed) "PRANK COX."
In this connection It may be salo
tbe exemptions from Jury service now
granted to men are founded upon
some other equally as Important duty
to the State which is being performed
by the ones thus exempted. It It is
deemed wise also to exempt women
from like sorvlce after they obtain tbe
vote It will be for like reason.
However, when the ballot Is extended
to women. If the majority of the voters
wish that they shall assure the
duty of jurors, the women of West
Virginia will accept the duty and
cheerfully and well perform the servicer

morning to'Bear "tne brief ' address
made by Cbae. K. Hughes, Republican
candidate for President, who passed
through West Virginia today.. Of the
ten thousand nearly ave hundred were
from Fairmont and Marlon county.
The strains of Yankee Doodle and
the old war marching songs played by
l he Pierpolnt Post Drum Corps as they
marched through the streets of the
city this morning roused many a
sleepy voter who might have slept
peacefully on and missed the early
cars that carried the Fuirmont delcga-1
tion to Clarksburg. , , I
This organization together with |
Vincents Greater Fairmont' hand attracted
many voters of ail parties to
the cars which left this morning at
seven o'clock. In addition to the
three special cars to accommodate ]
the membors of the Hughes Republican
Club of this city two regular cars
were run that were filled to overflowing
with the enthusiastic voters who
braved the chill of the early mornlug
tog to make the trip.
In the cars were a number of Fairmont
women who wanted to hear Mr.
Hughes and see Mrs. Hughes. They
were not disappointed as Mrs. Hughes
appeared on the platform with her husband
although she did not apeak to
the audience. The Fairmont delegation
was a small one among the thousands
who gathered for the early
morning speech .but they were the
most noticeable since the music from
their band and drum corps almost
drowned, the blare- of the one Clarksburg
band.
The crowd at Clarksburg was a remarkable
one for such an early morning
meeting and'the impression mhde
by Mr., Hughes on his audience was
a very pleasing one. When.ho first
