The Synod of Texas of the Presby
terian Church In the United States,
known as the Southern Presbyterian
Church, met In the First Presbyterian
church of this city Tuesday night at
8 o'clock.
The opening sermon was to have
been delivered by Ilcv. Win. M. An
derson, D. D., the preseut moderates,
but because of his recent Illness this
sermon was delivered by Rev. Thomas
Stone Clyce, D. D-, president of Aus
tin College, Sherman, Texas at the
request of Dr. Anderson who was
stricken about 'four week, ago with
paralysis.
In opening his address Dr. Clye
paid a glowing tribute to Rev. Ander
son. His text was taken from John
3; 7. "Ye Must be Born Again."
The subject was "'The New Birth"
and was treated In a two fold way:
1. Negitlvely. 2- Positively.
By way of Introduction the speaker
brought out vividly the Interview our
Savior had with the cultured, edu
cated, rich and popular leader of hla
sect, Nlcodemus. While Nlcodemu.
waa learned In many ways he found
out that he had not taken the flra't
step towards the kingdom.
Negatively "What the New Birth
la Not:" Not a mere profession of
'faith. Easy to exercise historical faith
but many have historical faith in
Christ that are not saved. Historical
faith Is not saving faith.
2. Neither is the new birth a Slav
Ish obedience to any church ordi
nance, no matter how sacred these
may be. .
3. It Is not reformation. A man
mar whitewash his fence, paint his
house and replaster his wall but theso
his Holy word, as the chosen Instr-i-mcnt
In the regeneration.
3. The Atonement,. Crucifixion,
Calvary Scene and all the fundamen
tal gospel fact, avail nothing without
this change of heart.
4. The sinner by this 1. made to
cry out "What Can I Do to Be Saved?"
Tbe object lesson that Jesus used
In bis matchless Illustration was that
a. Nlcodemus who was so familiar
It strikes us
that just about now you may
be in need of something in our
line. And no matter what it
is, if it's good you'll find it

probably see something you
ought to have.
