GRAND JURY MAY
PROBE HODGE CASE
A grand jury investigation of the disappearance of
large quantities of liquor held by Sheriff Hodge and said
by him to have been destroyed without a court order,
was being planned Wednesday by Deputy Prosecuting
Attorney Palmer.
An investigation started by Deputy Prosecutor
Palmer of the alleged destruction of 116 cases and eight
barrels of whisky brought out a failure on the part of
members of the sheriff's office to account for the liquor
before Justice Brinker, who late Tuesday recommended
a grand jury probe.
Palmer scoured the tide flats where the liquor was
supposed to have been destroyed and instead of 1,302
bottle tops and eight barrels, less than 200 bottle tops
were found.
Justice Brinker said that it was evident that the
case was so serious as to demand further investigation.
"Thin court ian do nothing."

DRY SQUAD HEAD SAYS
300 JOINTS 'COUGH IT;
EX-COP TAKEN IN RAID
Graft collections reach $80,000 a month! *
Three hundred "joint*" operate!
Share of the spoilt goes to police officers!
These were admissions made to The Star by Sergeant Putnam,
of the dry squad Wednesday.
Bootleggers, gamblers and rooming house oroprietors keep un
der cover by paying blood money.
Sergeant Putnam made the statements following the arrest of
ex-Policeman Margett, who was caught in a raid on a liquor
house at 5500 First ave. S. early Wednesday morning.
"At least 300 hotels, rooming houses, soft drink
ments, negro clubs and gambling houses are operating in defiancd;
of the law," he declared. "They pay from $50,000 to $80,000
protection money every month. J
"A month and a half agd fhe dry squad had the liquor situa*
tion pretty well in hand.
"Today, with all these places running, it is certain that the po
lice, or at least members of the department, know about them and
are not trying to suppress them.
"Any citizen can figure out what amount of protection paid by
these 300, or more, places must be if only as little as $100 a month
is paid by each. Twenty-five dollars a week is not excessive, con
sidering the high price of booze. j
"If the dry squad had not been hampered in almost every con*
ceivable way, its raids tipped off, its telephone tapped, and threats
of personal violence circulated—many of these from within the de
partment —conditions couldn't have become as thoroly rotten as
they are now."
May Be Graft, Saya Gill
There may be police officer*
collecting graft," Mayor «>lll aald
Wednesday "And I'd wrlcotne the
opportunity to put my finger on
them Peraonally. I believe condl

were released on habeas corpus
