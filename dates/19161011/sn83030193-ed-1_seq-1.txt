"This war cannot end In a patched

"Thb Isn't the moment for faint

the Prlmo Minister when the r '! rios
were again silent. "Tho nllles are not
vindictive, but they will requlro from
their enomles adequate reparation for

who have given their lives that thelrith the nVowed purpose of releasing
supreme saeilflres shall not have been
unavailing."
Parliament, said the Premier, had
been nsked to vote for war purposes
what was equivalent to the aggiegatc
expendltuto for twenty yen is beforo
the war, although that period Includ
ed the South Afrlcnn War. When he
moved the last vote of credit In July
he estimated the average rate of ex
pendltme at approximately 25,O0O,OOO
dally. That forecast had proved to
be almopt exactly coricri
At the commencement of the present
week, the Premier eontlnued, there
was still in hand 15fi2'.OO,O00, which
would carry on until Oct. 27, He
gavo the aggregate expenditure In 113
days of tho financial year as; Army,
navy and munitions, tl.S49.O00.00O;
loans to allies and dominions, 1786,000,

turea had risen slightly, he said, and
was f 25, 330,000 for tho last seventy
seven days of the financial year.

Kxpendltures for tho army hai
fallen off slights, while, thoso for
munitions had Increased somewhat.
Loans to Great Britain's allies and
Domlnilms were exreedlng the lludgr.t
estimate, at tho present rato.
Surveying th progress of the war
slnco tho last vote of credit, the
Premier said hot weather had ham
pered operations In the secondary
thcafrca, but that In Mesopotamia
substantial progress had been mndo
with rail and river communications
and tho health of the troops had lm-
proved substantially.
Tho defeat of tho TurkH at tho
