GERMAN SUBM
NINE SHIPS,
OFF NEW E
WAR VIRTUALLY BROUGHT
TO SHORES OF THE
UNITED STATES.
The European war virtually
has been brought to the shores
of the United States. In the
vicinity of Nantucket, off the
SMassachusetts coast, a German
submarine -or possibly more
than one-Sunday sent to the
bottom of the Atlantic Ocean at
l ast four British steamers and
two neutral vessels-one Dutch
and the other Norwegian.
The sunken boats. were the
Stephano, Strathdene, West
Point and Kingston, flying the
British flag and the Bloom
ersjidk, Dutch, and Christian
Knudsen, Norwegian. So far as
known, there were no fatalities.
The Stephano carried 83 pas
sengers, all of whom were
saved.

Newport Society Set Proffers Help to
Shipwrecked Rescued by U. S. Na
val Vessels.-Vessel's Cargo Not
Heavy.
Newport R. I.-The British steamer
Stephano, bound from St. Johns. N.
F., to New York, carrying nearly 100
first and second cabin passengers, in
cluding many American touris' was
hunk off Nantucket lightship at 4:30
p. m. Sunday; presumably by the Ger
ban submarine t-53. The United
States torpedo boat destroyer Balch
reported the loss of the liner by radio
to the naval station here, stating that
the ship had been torpedoed. The
message from the destroyer said that
the crew was safe aboard the Balch,
but made no mention of the passen
gers, who, it was thought here, also
were taken care of.
Confirmation of the rescue of the
passengers by the Balch was con.
taned in a later message sent by the
destroyer to the naval station here. It
was said that she had picked up the
-passengers and later had transferred
the Americans to the destroyer Jen
Rear Admiral Knight, commandant
of the Narrangansett naval district
ad -that the passengers who desired
to do so- would be allowed to remain on
the warship' until morning and that
every effort would be made by officers
and men to make them as comfortable
as possible. At the same time, he
said, if any of those picked up wanted
to be set ashore their wishes would
be complied with as promptly as pos
sible.
Society Offers Aid.
Members of the so-called Newport
society set were prompt to extend prof
fers of help to shipwrecked passengers
through Admiral Knight. Mrs. Robert
L. Beekman, wife of Governor Beek
man and Mrs. French Vanderbilt, vol
unteered to take care of as many refu
gees as possible. Many of the pas
sengers on the Stepha~no are residents
of New York. At this time of the year
the vessel carries a fairly heavy pas
senger list made up of summer tour
ists who spend their summer sin New
Founland and in the Canadian mari
. time provinces.
The cargo loss of the Stephano, it
was expected, would not be very heavy
as on her westbound voyage she usual
ly carried little freight. This made
up largely, as a rule of fish oil and
other fish prodnets. The vessel was in
the regular service of the Red Cross
Line.
The sale of the Stephano to the'
Russian govrnment which had planned
to use her as an ice breaker, was re
cently announced. Her sister ship, the
Florizel of the same line also had been
sold to Russia for ice work.
Stephano Stoutly BuIlt.
The Stephano was of stout con
struction, built especially for the
heavy ice conditions encountered in
winter sailings on the New F'oundland
coast. It was expected in marine
circles that this was intended as one
of the last regular sailings of the Ste
phano prior to her sailing for the
White Sea to work with a large fleet
engaged by Russia to keep her north
ernmost port of Archangel open for
the receipt of war supplies.
The liner was in commaand of Capt.
Smith, who it Is thought had taken
the outside course inrounding Nan
tucket lightship and had fallen into
the grip of the undersea raider.
COMPLICATIONS NOT FEARED
BY UNITED STATE OFFiCIALS
Washington.-Submarin~e warfare at
the very doors of the United States
does not necessarily portend further
eomplications with Germany so long
as It is carried on within the limita'
tons of international law.
That Is the view of official Wash
ington on the record of one day's opeer
ations In which none of the ships de
stroyed appears to have been attach
ed without warning or without propew
measures having been taken for sam'
ty of those aboard.

p
Shock Follows Sensation. P
The sensation created when the
U-53 quietly slipped into Newport har
bor and as quietly slipped away three
hours later, was less than the sho k G
in shipping circles when wireless re
ports of submarine attacks began to
come into the naval radio stations.
Within a few minutes the air was lit
erally charged with electricity as
wireless messages of warnings were
broadcasted along the coast. The
submarine or submarines had taken
a position directly in the steamer
lanes. where they could hardly miss
a.nything bound in for New York or b
bound east from that port.
Vessels of the Entente Allied Na- cc
tions and neutral bottoms carrying
contraband of war scurried to get S
within the three-mile limit of the fe
American shore. Several that were Ti
following the outside course shifted
and made for the inside lane. The el
Stephano, of the Red Cross line, how- fe
ever, was caught outside the neutral H
zone. The destruction of this vessel
was perhaps the biggest prize of the ri
day. The craft had been sold to the fe
Russian Government and would have M
been used as an icebreaker after her
present trip. P;
Throughout the day and up to late S1
at night, none of the patrolling fleet M
maintained by the British and French
to protect their own shipping and Bi
American ships carrying munitions fe
of war had been sighted. Frantic J.
appeals were sent to Halifax.
Stirs Up Halifax.
"All steps possible in the circum- F
stances are being taken to deal with
the situation." GI
This message was received by the fe
Associated Press from the commander- r
In-chief of the British North Atlantic
squadron at Halifax, N. S. It was in Jr
reply to a request foi- a statement by fe
him. The work of the patrolling h,
fleets was directed from Halifax and
ever since the war began cruisers and in
auxiliary vessels of the British and fe
French navies have moved un and S,
down the coast. The passengers and
crews of destroyed vessels who were M
being brought into Newport were r.ot St
expected to reach there until after,
midnight.
Preparations to care for them had St
been made by Rear Admiral Knight, 10:
commandant of the Narrangansett Bay O
naval station, and Rear Admiral
Gleaves, commander of the destroyer le
flotilla now at Newport. 31
Later reports gave further details D
of the attacks. The Stephano met a
submarine six miles southeast of B
Nantucket lightship and was attacked Cc
by gunfire and a torpedo. She re- B:
malned afloat until 10:05 o'clock.
G
The West Point went down 10 miles SI
south of the Nantucket Hghtship. The
Strathdene was attacked "off light
ship" the reports stated and the
Bloomersjiidk was sunk three miles S
south of the lightship. She remained S
afoat some time going dhwn at 8:05.
The American steamer Kansan was S
held up three meils east of Nantuck~et g
lightship. lea
,West Point Gave Warning.
The first wireless warning of the R<
presence of a hostile submarine in the St
steamship lane was given in the .dis- R.
tress signals of the West Point which
reported that she had been torpedoed R
30 miles southeast of Nantucket light. fe
This message apparently was picked ra
up by every vessel having a wireless
equipment within range for within a tl
very short time press dispatches from fe
St. Johns, N. F., and Halifax, N. S., laa
indicated that the patrolling warships
had received the alarm. The British W
censorship, however, prevented the Sa
disclosure of the movements of the H
patrolling vessels.
Booming ef Guns Heard.
The booming of the submarine's
guns, apparently fered In warning.
was distinctly heart at Nantucket. It L
was plain that the submarine had
placed herself In the lane of passen-A
ger and freight traffic and terrorized
shipping along the coast.
In a flash after the first distress
signals of the West Point ware sent,L
wireless messages of warning were
sent broadcast. so
Every vessel was warned to make fe
for the three-mile zone and the com- F:
manders of merchant vessels of the
Entente Allies lost no time In shift-* J.

Those that were following what Is 1M
known as the outside course turne.d

SOUTH CAROLINA BOYS
ON THE MEXICAN BORDE
A Weekly News Letter From I
Palmetto Soldiers Now Stationec
at Fort Bliss, Texas.
The South Carolina boys ha
been undergoing a strenuous progr;
of field training, first by compani
then by battalions, next by re
ments, that followed by brigade a
now they have been formed into a
vision with Your additional briga
from other states and will be 1
through several days of field r
noeuvres. The division will be un<
the command of General Morton. 'I
press dispatches of the week from
Paso mentioned the fact that the P
metto soldiers with the rest of th
division would be taken for a hike
La Cruces, N. M.. which is some
miles from their camp. They will
fully equipped, just as if they wi
taking the field during actual war a
will undergo all the training whic
big army experiences in the field d
ing war times.
Of all the National Guard orga
zations which were encamped ini
El Paso patrol district, it was si
that Masachusetts ranked first in
fciency, Michigan second and Soi
Carolina third. Both Massachuse
and Michigan had been on the bor4
six weeks before the Palmetto b<
arrived and it must also be remie
bered that those states appropri
many timos tbe amount of mon'ey
their National Guard that South Ca
lina does. Their states are more pr
perous and have more money to g
them, for one thing.
The soldier boys are all work:
hard and doing whatever Is gii
them without murmuring. Of coun
they think a lot of home and wol
like to be back with their people.
they are not kicking and "cussli
like some. They do feel as If tI
ought not to be kept sitting down
the Texas plains in a concentrati
camp indefinitely. They responded
the call to arms when it looked as
there was going to be trouble w
Mexico and they today would go o1
the Rio Grande with a shout if ordi
came from Washington to Invade M
Io. They have been in camp n
since June 18, either at Styx or
their present location seven miles
of El Paso on the Texas plains.
Home Within 30 Days.
It is generallly believed that eitl
by November 1 or shortly thereaf
all of the South Carolina soldiers v
be returned to Styx and muste:
out of the federal service. It see
to be the plan to return the tro<
home in the order in which they wi

MOUNTAIN CITY OBSERVES CON
SERVATION HOLIDAY IN
GREAT ORDER.
PARADE AND GOOD SPEAKING
Public Health Celebration For County
Made Up of Pageant and Speak
ing By Leading Orators.
Greenville.--With Congressman Ad
anson of Georgia, Congressman Lever
:;d Nicholis of South Carolina, First
As:istant Secretary Newton of the
tras.ury, Chief L. L. Lumsden of the
United States public health service;
R. A. Cooper of Laurens, Dr. J. Adams
Hayne. head of the state health de
partm ent .and Dr. J. W. Kerr, assist
ant m..geon of the United States,
among the guests of honor. Green
ville county held a public health cel
ebration which eclipsed anything of
the kind ever before known here. A
pageant was the feature of the day,
scores of floats being in the parade.
Two bands, one from Easley and one
from Pelzer, took part, and the coast
artillery companies of Spartanburg
and Greenville also were in the pa
rade. The celebration was held in
connection with the work being done
here by the United States department
of public health 1nd despite bad
wenther was a great success.
At the opera house addresses were
made by the guests of honor to a
c:owd of several hundred people.
Congressman Adamson was enthusias
tically applauded. His address was
more humorous than serious.
The features of the evening were
the announcements by Congressman
Lever that henceforth he was a vig
orous friend to public health appro
priatior.s and the statements of Dr.
Lumsden that Greenville county has
probably the highest sanitary index
in the United States, that the city
sanitary mesaures he has found are
the best in the United States so far
as he knows; that Greenville is the
only city he knows or that needs no
suggestion a!ong lines of sanitation,
and that every mill village, except one,
every incorporated town and every
unincorporated town, as well as 18
per cent of the county's population
at large, have complied and are com
plying with the suggestions for sani
tation made by the public health de
partment in its sanitary survey of the
county. Tyhpoid fe'ver, reduced by
half th's year, will be practically
elimirated in this county, stated Dr.
Lumsden. The one mill village not
yet in line will do vhat has been sug
:ested. said Dr. Lumsden, as the
president of that mill had promised
to do so.
Assistant Secretary Newton stated
that the celebration was a national
vent, and that what had been done
in Greenville county will be told of
all over the land, with a view to get
ting other sections to do the same
thing.
In the sanitary survey more than
11,000 homes have been visited and
thoroughly inspected and recommen
datorns for improvements made. The
real work of cleaning up Is just be
ginning.
The keynote of the day was con
servation of human life; the fl'oats
ircached this, the speakers talked
>f? it.
Prizes awarded to the best floats
.-ere given as follows: First, health
sparreit of the city of Greenville;
rond, Southeastern Life Insurance
ompany; third, equal suffrage float
from Cenestee mill.
Big Fire at Hartsville.

MIGHTY IN si EWS OF WAR
If Wealth is Any Test This Country
Could Stagger Any Hostile
Combination.
If we accept Professor Atkinson's
estimate that the Civil war cost $8,
0O0,000,0 00, and remember that the na
tional wealth, including slaves, was
placed by ti' ; census at only $16,159,
616,06S i" .tS60, and at only a little
more than $30,000,000,000 in depreciat
ed currency even five years after the
war had ended, it is seen that the
struggle between the states cost be
tween one-fourth and one-half of their
then existing wealth.
All calculations as to what wars
cost are subject to grievous and e'en
monumental errors, Albert W. Atwood
writes in the Saturday Evening Post.
But this much we know: The north
raised nearly $4,000,000,000 in loans
and the south raised $2,000,000,000.
Call it $6,000,000,000 actually obtained
for wa- purposes by the two opposing
sections.
If the north and south in conflict
could spend $6,000,000,000 on war half
a 'century ago, what could the united
country assemble for such a purpose
today,.with ten times the wealth? This
country has a puny, negligible na
tional debt. The European countries
were enormously-almost ruinously
in debt before they began their war,
some of them with ten to fifteen times'
as much debt per capita as the United
States. Yet they have already floated
$30,000,000,000 of bonds, and the end
is nowhere in sight.
The total aggregate wealth of all
the belligerents is hardly more than
one-third greater than ours. If wealth
is any test this country could stag
ger almost any conceivable combina
tion that might be formed against it.
SALESWOMAN GOT WRONG TIP,1
Finally Discovered That Her Customer
Was In a Way English and Yet
Not "English."
A well-dressed young woman stepped
off the elevator in one of the depart
ment stores and started to make her
way toward the millinery department.
From the manner in which the floor
walker stepped up and addressed her,
calling her by name, it was obvious
that she was a, customer whose pat
ronage was sought. She intended to
buy a hat, she informed the floor
walker, and he escorted her to the ml
linery department, called for the head
woman and introduced her to the cus
tomer.
"Miss Smith," he said, addressing
the saleswoman, "this is Miss Hobbs."
And then, with instructions to see that
the customer saw the best in the store;
the floor walker departed.
The saleswoman, observant student
of human nature, was effusive in her
attentions, but she had heedlessly dis
regarded the name of her customer.
Miss Hobbs' favor seemed to rest with
a plainly tailored hat.
"That is an English walking hat,"
the saleswoman explained. "'It looks
perfectly stunning on you. It looks. as
though it were just made for you. Are
you English?"
"No," said the customer absent-mind
edly, as she adjusted the kat further
over her eyebrows. "My name is Eng
lish, but--"
"Ah, yes, Miss English, I noticed
that. Are you any selation to Captain
English?"
The young woman, with an eifort,
controlled the expression onher face,
and managed to explain to the embar
rassed saleswoman that her name was
not "English," but that she had an
English name.-Indianapolis News.
Legislative "Work."
Congressman Bennet of New York
was talking on the floor of the house
the other day and Ben Hilliard of
Colorado asked him to yield just forI
an eentsy-teentsy bit while he asked
a question. The nature of the ques
tion does not concern us, but Bennet
replied:
"I'm a Yankee and so I'll answer the
gentleman's question by asking anoth
er question-" And he did so.
"I'm a bit of a Yankee myself," re
plied Hilliard, "and I'll answer the
gentleman's question by asking anoth
er question:"
Whereupon Bennet fell back on his
Yankee prerogative and asked still
another qestion.
Thus the thing went on until one of
them got tired and they called It fifty
fifty-with none of the questions an
swered.
China Sales to W. S. Increase.
The United States is annually In
creasing its purchases from Chinese

gatinig $33,495,497, an increase of $14,
450,427 over the previous year, accord
ing to invojce records of the Ameri
can consulate at Shanghai.
Chinese dyestuff and indigo mer
chants are reaping large profits from
the sale of their accumulated stocks,
Consul Sammons at Shanghai report

creases: Gold bar shipments, $3,170,
754; raw silk, $2,840,105; straw braid,
$01,496. and sheep's wool, $566,067.
Burn 90,000 Bad Eggs.
One way to get rid of bad eggs is to
burn them. Federal officials set fire
to 90,000 of them at Washington when
the department of agriculture pure
food experts declared the eggs to be
unfit for food. The eggs had been
placed in a.orage in a stable, and were,
discovered, then the District of Co
lumbia supreme court condemned
them.

Train Deafened Soldiers to Work..
According to official estimates, more
than 50,000 German soldiers have lost
their hearing in the terrible battles
f this war. To enable, these unfor
tunates to earn their bread after the*
war, a number of schools have been
established, with the aid of the gov
ramen.
The largest one Is in Hamburg, and
has about 300 pupIls, who receive very.
careful instruction, and in a compara-.
tively short time become proficient in
ip reading. Many of them are able
to take up their former trades a~nd
professions agai'n but some have to be
trained for other vocations. About 15
per cent have their hearing partly re
stored by delicate operations and spe
cial training.
Recently 30 deaf soldiers were "grad- ,
uated" from the Hamburg institute.~
mong them were three lawyers, two
school teachers, five clerks and book
keepers, two civil engineers and two
ofice manage~rs, who all have returned
to their former occupations.
Travelers AlT!
In vain we multiply the artifices of
progress. The universality of travel*
has made us forget its meaning.
To share your pleasures with all the
world is to lose them. Above all,
steam and gasoline havg killed the
spirit of adventure.
There are very few wanderers left
who are willing to take their chanie
t a night's lodging under the stars.
