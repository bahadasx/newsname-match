ment comos out for President
Wilson. In his statement ho
says: "
"Notwithstanding his action In
the eight hour day controversy,
I am for Wilson. That was a
mistake and a serious one, but
we all make mistakes. We
must be Judged-by the average
of achievements. My firm con
viction Is that Wilson has more
great achievements to his credit
than moot presidents who have
preceded him.
"Wilson settled the currency
question, settled It so effectually
and wisely that his most reckless
critics are silent upon the sub-
Ject.
"His management of our re- )
latlons to the European war sit-
uatlon is the grain-it and most bril
liant page In our diplomatic
history."

"WILSON HAS LINCOLN SOUL
SO LIFE LONG
SAYS AS HE
"Woodrow Wilson is nearer like
Abraham Lincoln In thought and ac
tion than any president or statesman
"nce Lincoln's time."
With this Matemcnt G. S. Andrus,
bearded pioneer of Grant county who
heard the historic debate between
Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas at
Qulncy, III., explain why he, though
a life-long republican, is giving his
support to President Wilson In the
present campaign.
Mr. Andrus arrived here yesterday
from his home at Long Creek. At
the time Lincoln was a candidate for
president he was a resident of Keo
kuk, Iowa, and was a member of ot
the Lincoln campaign 'lub called
"The Wideawakes." as opposed to
"Tho Hickories'" who were out for
Douglas. When Lincoln and Douglas'
was scheduled to debate at Qulncy
both organisations took a steamer for!

the greatest Campaign debate ' ever

LONG BRANCH. Oct. 11. Secre
tary Lansing went to Washington
after a long conference with Wilson.
He discussed the new German subma
rine campaign. It is believed here
that Germany acted strictly within
her rights.
Nevertheless, the administration
must decide whether America can tol
erate further submarine activities out.
side her ports, menacing commerce
and endangering Americans. Wilson
received scores of telegrams from bus
iness Interests demanding that Ger
many be sharply reminded she can
not virtually blockade American pqfts-
Some advise that the government's
action should not be limited to a mere
protest. Officials declined to com-'
ment on the government's next step.
Lansing refused to make a statement.
After an early breakfast, Wilson
golfed. Summer White House offices
divulged nothing concerning the con
ference. It is believed likely the ad
ministration may endeavor to get fur
ther information regarding Ger

REPUBLICAN
PLEDGES VOTE
He docscrlbed the debate graphical
ly. Douglas delivered the most polish
ed oration he ever heard, ho said, and
seemingly made an Impression that
could not be overcome. But Lincoln,
he said, after he had fairly warmed
up to his subject, made the greatest
speech ever made by mortal man.
"I heard that speech of Lincoln
and never will forget It," he said. "I
have read practically all of the utter
ances of President Wilson and have
followed his record closely, and I
truly believe he la more like Lincoln
than any president or statesman since
Lincoln's time That's why I am
supporting him for re-election."
Mr. Andrus had another reason
with which, he said, he ended all po-
lltlcal arguments. "I've been a
freighter and teamster on this const
for over fifty years," he said! "and
when I found a horse that pulled true
up bad hills and out of bad holes I
Kept htm. I never believed in swap-
ping such a horse In the middle of a
trip for a horse that I had never seen
