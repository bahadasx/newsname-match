IS COMING
Famous Texas Orator Spends Week in
Grady County; Ready to Divide
Time
W. C. Witcher, editor of tho "Gnostic
Anti-SocialiHt," of Graudview, Texas,
famous throughout Texas and a large
part of 'Oklahoma as a debater,' will
spend the week beginning October l(i
in Grady county, delivering ten lej
tures, two of which will be given iu
Chickasha.
Mr. Witcher states that he will be
willinglo meet any reputable Socitmrn
epeaker and divide tune with him but
in case nobody appears to cross) sworcs ,
with him in argument ho will deliver
one of his anti-Socialist lectures," con.
sisting of an unbiased and analytical
discussion of tho fundamental princi
ples of Socialism."
Among the eminent Socialists whom
Mr. Witcher has met in debate are
Stanley J. Clark with whom he has
held ten discussions, Geo. G. Hamil
ton on eighteen different occasions.
Kate O'Hare and various others. Ac
cording to press reports he is a most
entertaining speaker, bis manner being
pleasing and his reasoning clear and
convincing. "My purpose is to con
vince my hearers of the folly of Social
ism by -argument, not by slush and
mud, says Mr. Witcher.
Wherever the Texas man hag ap
peared his lectures have drawn im
mense crowds. His dates in Grady

ers, with Cheaney in the box in the
fourth.
Tight playing on both sides left the
score unchanged! at the end of the
sixth, greatly to the disappointment of
the National's fans who had bet even
money on the issue of the day, encour
aged by yesterday's handsome victory.
The crowd seemed to think that this
was Brooklyn's day and backed them
heavily, and a clear, cool day filled
both grandstand and bleachers.
Hopelessly drifting about for a man
who could stop the Red Sox when
they succeeded in lauding again in the
seventh, Rucker was brought in to
relieve Cheaney in the box for the
home team and the visitors went to
bat in the eighth with a score of 6 to
2 in their favor.
No runs in the ninth on either side
left the visitors the victors with the
store 6 to 2, the three Dodger boxineu
having been pounded for ten hits.
The position as to errors was re
versed rn today's game, Boston getting
out with one while Brooklyn piled up
four witl) a poor showing from tho
box. ,
Today's victory places three of the
required four games necessary to win
the world's series to the credit of Bos
ton, Another victory will place them
at the head of the national sport for
the year.

That be had tried to shoot "Dad"
Dryden, jailer of Grady county, be

of Joseph Hood, a cotton "picker of

. Hood, w ho is about 40 years old,
tells a beautiful tale of marrying his
fair daughter to a member of the no
bility but 'spoils it all by adding that
he has a good many children but they
are all crazy. All of hifi miatives, he
says, including the children, went to
Texas where there is only wind and
water and adds that everybody who
lives in Texas is crazy. He believes
he occupies cell No. 13 but finds eon
solatiou in the idea that Jesus Christ
occupied cell thirteen and Judas lsca
riot No. 11. '
"Are you a Woodrow Wilson man,"
asked a member of the board, but to
this the cotton pvker took exception
and asked iu return, "Are you the com
mander of the army that you have the
right to ask me?"
Hood added that he attended school
under both Henry W. Longfellow and
George Washington and complained
that one of the county officials was
jealous of him.

county court has arisen iu the case of
