No. 41
Democratic
And Republi?
can Claims,
Tho Republican campaign
committee are entertaining rosy
views in regard to the outcome
of tho Presidential election in
November.
They bus3 their hopes huge?
ly on five propositions* ns fol?
lows;
1. Tho Wilson 8 hour rail?
road legislation, which is said
to have cost him the votes of
tho farmers.
2. The increasing power of
Mr. IIugliCB' speeches.
It. A moro complete dmal
gumation of Republicans and
Progressives than was at first
indicated.
?1. Tho Main election, the
moral effect of which has been
noticeable in virtually overy
contested State.
S, The Qorman-American
vote will be caBt almost solidly
against Mr. Wilson, as these
voters arc very bitter against
him, on account of his attitude
toward Germany. So it is
claimed that these live elements
will more than insure the elec?
tion of Mr. Hughes.
The Democratic Claim.
Washington, Oct. 7.?The
Democrats claim that the work?
ing men of the country in gen?
eral and the organized labor|
voto in particular will be over?
whelmingly for Mr. Wilson,
This with tho regular party
voto will insure the election of
Mr Wiluoin. They also atate
while they will lose a few Qer
man-American votes yet they
make the claim that for each
of such votes, they will gain
double tho number from the
regular Republicans, those who
aro "American first" and Re?
publicans afterwards. The!
Democrats are also giving out|
a little table in which they
figure out a sweeping Demo
cratic victory this fall, anil yet
strange to.say they base their
figures on the votes brought out
in the Republican victory in
Maine on September 11th
The vote showed that the Re?
publicans polled a vote equal to
tho Dull Moose und Republicans
combined und the Democratic
voto of M.OOO which Maine cust
for Wilson in 1012 was increas?
ed to 1)8,500 this year, an in?
crease of more than-one third.
The Democratic leaders claim
that on (his basis, conceding to
Mrs. Hughes a vole equal to
that received by Roosevelt in
1812 which was 4,108,664 and
Mr. Taft which was 3,430,620,
Mr. Hughos will receive 7,608,-|
000 votes; and increasing Mr.
Wilson's vote G,303,000 of 1912,
by one-third, Wilson would re
cuivo 8,404,000 aud carry the |
following states by the follow?
ing votes:

Ohio.5111,000 500,000 24|
WestVa.151,000 18-1,000
Ml
It will be seen from this tablo
that these states would give
l'resident Wilson 144 electoral
votes, which added to the 1731
electoral votes of the sure|
Democratic states that Mr. Wil?
son will receive a total of atj
least 317 electoral votes when |
he only needs 200 to elect him.
By "sure Democratic votes,"
is meant that those states in
which.the Wilson vote of 1912
was greater than the Taft and
Roosevelt vote combined.
TO WHIP CHILDREN FOR
RUNNING ON STREETS.
Town of Norton Takes
Drastic Steps in Quaran?
tine Against Diptheria
and Fever.
Norton, Va , Oct. 8.-4A re?
vival of the whipping post, or
what ma}- amount to the same
thing, may be aeon in Norton
under an ordinance passed by
the town council in order to en?
force a quarantine against scai
let fever and diphtheria here.
At a special meeting of tho
town council an ordinance was
passed causing all public
schools, churches, moving pic?
ture shows or other public
gatherings to bo closed until
October is, unless other cases
of scarlet fever or diphtheria
than the ones hero now develop.
There are live cases of diph?
theria and four cases of scarlet
fever hero.
When members of tho town
council learned that there was
no danger of epidemic? of ei?
ther disease spreading if a
strict quarantine were kept, a
local law was passed to force
every child under 15 years of
age to stay at home and not
leave the premises under penal?
ly of a line of $10 or to receive
a public whipping at the city
hall.
This step was taken, it is
said, because children in whoso
homes scarlet fever has existed
have been on the streets. It is
alleged the police have taken
such children back to their
homes, but they were back on
the streets with other childron
again within a few minutes.
KILLED WALKING ON
TRACK.
Frightful Morality From Tres?
passing on the Southern.
Atlanta, Qa., Oct. C?Death
overtook 171 persons, while
walking on tracks or swinging
trains, or otherwise trespassing
on the property of the Southern
Railway during the year ended
June 30th.
Despite all warnings of its
danger, the practice of trespass?
ing on Railroad property seems
on the increase. For tho three
previous years the number of
trespassers killed on the South
orn was as follows: 1913, 155;
1011, 120; 1915, 140, making
with 1018 a total of 001 live
sacrificed to carelessness.
Statistics shows that tho
great majority of railroad tres?
passers killed are useful citi?
zens. Wage earners, using the
tracks while walking to and
from their work, furnish a large
proportion while fully a third
aro school boys, killed while
"hopping" trains.
University of Virginia.
Charlottosville, Va.,Oct. 0.?
Registration at the University
of Virginia is now close to 1,000,
tho last classified students
showing a total of ??82 dis?
tributed as follows: College,
505; Graduate, 48; Law, 213;
Medicine, 103; aud Engineer?
ing, 103. In December of last
year the summary by depart?
ments of the 1,011 students then
in attendance was as follows:
College,523; Graduate, 47; Law,
242; Medicine, 114; Engineering,
115. With the total of 982 this
early in the session, it seems
probable that last year's figures
will be generally exceeded.
Campaign
ForArmenian
Relief.
Greatest Effort Undertaken
Since BelgianCoramission
Was Organized.
Washington, Oct. 7.?Tho
greatest American relief cam?
paign to be undertaken since
organization of the Belgian
Uelief Commission was launch?
ed to-day by tho American
Committee for Armenian and
Syrian Relief. An exhaustive
summary of tho whole Ar?
menian and Syrian situation
was made public, and will be
sent to ministers of 120,000
churches all over tho country
and to many leading citizens
and relief organizations. A
fund of $5,000,000 is called for
to relieve 1,000,000 destitute,
exile and starving Armenians
and Syrians, scattered broad?
cast over Turkey, Persia, Syria
and Palestine. The appeal de?
clares that of nearly 2,000,000
Armenian originally in their
native country, three-quarters
of a million have boon massa
joredorhave died of wounds,
disease or exhaustion since the
war begun.
ThoStato Department .through
urgent negotiations, recently
secured Turkey's consent to
extension of American relief,
provided it is distributed joint?
ly by the American Uod Gross
and tho Turkish Red Crescent.
To day it was announced that
the allied blockade had been
lifted to allow passage of the
supplies. October 21 und 22
have been set aside by proc?
lamation by President Wilson
as relief days, and the appeal
being sent broadcast by the
committee calls for sormons
in every pulpit of the country
and articles in every newspa?
per.
Some of the Armenians can?
not be reached, since Turkey's
consent has not been extended
to Armenia proper. .Many thou?
sands would be found in Per?
sia, however, and the sections
recently conquered by the Rus?
sians, as well as in Syria. In
this latter section, the appeal
declares, the situation has been
made even more terrible by
restrictions of the allied block
ado and tho scarcity of Turkish
railroads, by the exportation of
supplies for the Turkish armies
and uy the destruction of other
supplies by a virulent locust
scourge.
"People were found eating
grass, herbs and locusts" bo'-t
the committee in describing its
investigation of conditions
there, "and in desperate cases
dead animals and human bodies
are reported to have been eaten.
In some cases men were lined
up so that several could be shot
with one bullit, in order not to
waste ammunition. A mother
said that not a girl ubove
twelve (and some younger) in
the village of-escaped vio?
lation. Tho peoplo kill and oat
the street dogs. A short time
ago they killed and ato a dying
man.
"Of 450 from one villuge, on?
ly one woman lives. She saw
her husband and three sons tied
together und shot with one bul?
let to save ammunition. She
saw her daughters outraged
and then killed. She was car?
ried away by a Kurd, but es?
caped by night, naked, and, af?
ter terrible suffering, fell in
with some refugees.
"In the literal sense of the
word, about 120,000 Armenians
arrived nt Etchrni&dzm stripped
even of their outor garments.
There 11,000 people died und
40,000 more in tho country.
"In Aleppo relief funds nro
so inadequate that many exiles
in tho destitute places have on?
ly grass to oat, and thoy aro
dying of sturvatiou by tho hun?
dreds. Erz.rook soerns to havo
been dealt with most savagely.
Loss than 200 Armenians out of
20,000 havo escaped ecath or de?
portation.
"Of tho first enrnvan of 000
pcoplo sent from Deir Zor to
Ana, tho Arabs killed 500 on
tho way. In n native letter
from Halob last week tho num?
ber of orphans nt that placo
was estimated at 25,000. Some
of the villages lost more than
one-third of their population."

The Associated Charities held
their annual mooting in the
sample room of tho Monte Vista
Hotel last Tuesday afternoon
at 4. o'clock. There wero sever?
al present and tho meeting was
