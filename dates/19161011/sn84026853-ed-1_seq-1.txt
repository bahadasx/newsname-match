ATTACKED BY NEGRO
Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Walter
. Scott ent down to his (
farm on the Mt. Carmol road.
As be was returning about dusk
he overtook a negro just this
side of the Sherard place, who
asked to be allowed to ride. The
request was granted. Mr. Scott
noticed that the negro kept
looking back through the top
of the buggy in which they were
riding, but he attached no importance
to it. The negro must
have struck him suddenly and
severely because without warning
he was knocked unconscious.
He regained consciousness some
miles up the road, finding him
elf in tbe foot of hit buggy,
with his pocketbook, containing ;
about $75 gone, and a large gash (
cut in his forehead. He made1 (

soon arrived and dressed his
wound. ,

/ \
Active.
,
C. C. Gambrell, president of the
Abbeville County Fair association,
in conversation with a representative
1
of The Press and Banner yesterday,
3tated: "From all reports which I
have so far received, I am convinced
that the seventh annual fair, to be
iield inAbbeville November 1, 2, and
3, will be a success in every way.
Hardly a day passes but that I receive
encouraging reports from many
parts of the county, and taking all
into consideration, I am thoroughly
satisfied that the event will materialize
into the greatest success the
county has ever experienced. One
important factor whieh convinces'me
...... . . < >
that this years lair win oe tne Dest
in the history of the association, is \
the enthusiastic manner in which the
various officers and committees of
the association have gone about their
work. I wish to urge all the people
who are interested in the progress of
Abbeville county to join in the undertaking
and make it truly, a fair to
be remembered."
President Gambrell is indeed gratified
at the splendid manner in which
the people have responded to the
cause, and well he should be, for we
will, from present indications, . witness
one of the best county^ fairs fer**" ?
be found anywhere.
v ?
Publicity Committee Active.
The publicity committee appointed
to look after the advertising, premium
list, printing, and publicity of the
enterprise, is doing fine work for
the fair., A handsome booklet containing
the advertisements of about
thirty of Abbeville's most progressive
business houses, is about complete
and will be delivered \^ithin the next
ken days. The booklet contains complete
program for the three days,
rules and regulations governing exhibits,
entries, and races, together
with an extraordinary long list of
handsome cash prizes.
The publicity committee has made
several tours of different sections of
the county during the past week
distributing advertising matter, and
according to Secretary Williamson,
who is chairman of this committee,
there will be hundreds of exhibitors
here this year who have never before
shown interest in the fair. The committee
is also waging a very successful
advertising campaign in Anderson
and McCormick counties, where much
interest is being shown in Abbeville's
fair.
Lever to Make Address.
Congressman A. F. Lever has accepted
an invitation extended by
Secretary Williamson to address the
farmers on Wednesday, the opening
day, and the day set aside for the
farmers. This able speaker is a decided
favorite of the farmers and his
address will attract thousands of
people from surrounding counties on
farmers day.
Midway a Feature.
There will be many free attractions
on the midway this yea*. There
will be various amusements for everybody,
old and young. Gorgeous
parades, enchanting music and other
picturesque achievements to fascinate
those who are as yet in the
springtime of youth; a most creditable
showing of live stock, poultry,
farm and garden products, household
and miscellaneous exhibits, together
with the spirit of comradeship and
the occasion of hundreds of old
time friends reunited will serve to
fill with delight and perfect cententment
the hearts of those Who have
reached the golden autumn of old
age. MR.
