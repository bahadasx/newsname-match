NO GROUND FOR
U.S. COMPLAINT,
VIEW IN J5ERLIN
Berlin, Oct 11. The submarine cam
paign off the American coast, accord
ing to the firm conviction in Admiralty
circles, undoubtedly is being' conducted
Iln full accordance wih the recognized
rules of cruiser warfare, which pro
vide that the German submarines shall
not' sink ships 'without warning and
without' making adequate provisions
for the safety of passengers and crews.
The i decision of the American court in
case of the British steamer Appam,
which was awarded to her British
owners after being taken into Norfolk
by a German prize crew, makes it im
practicable to send prizes into Ameri
can ports. Submarine commanders
therefore have no option except to de
stroy them.
It Is assumed here that the Ameri
can government has no ground for ob
jection to the operations of submarines
in such proximity to the American
coast and German, warships are merely
following the example of Great Brit
ain and. her allies', which have kept
watch oft the American coast.
Neither the foreign office nor the
Admiralty is willing to express an
inlon as to Individual cases like tha
of the British steamship Stephano or
the Dutch steamship Bloomersdijk.
Joseph G. Grew,- who is acting as
American Charge DAffalres during
the absence of Ambassador Gerard,
has received no communications from
Washington on this . subject nor has
he thus far taken up any phase of it
with the foreign office. The Berlin
newspapers are Just beginning to re
ceive the despatches describing the ex
citement in the United States over the
submarine campaign. The only refer
ence to it thus far published Is a pas
sage in a Wall street report, and con
sequently there has been no newspaper
comment on this subect.

Resign From Directorate

EIGHT LEAVE THE
TRUST CO. BOARD
City National Bank Not Af
- f ected by New Clayton
N Banking Act.
The biggest shake-up that ever hit
banking institutions of Bridgeport is
in progress today. As a result of or
ders received through the Federal Re
serve bank, supplemented) by the de
nial of a request to Secretary McAdoo
of the United States treasury to per
mit certain directors to remain in so
called Interlocking directorates here, a
dozen of Bridgeport's most prominent
financiers have resigned from local
banks.
The banking Institutions affected
are:
First-Bridgeport National.
Bridgeport Trust Compapy
Connecticut National Bank.
Hincks Brothers.
T. L. Watson & Company.
Those who have retired from the di
rectorate of at least one bank because
of their directorships In other banks
are:
Charles G. Sanford, Peter W. Wren,
Hamilton Shelton, DeVer H. ' Warner,
B. D. Pierce, Jr., Clinton Barnum See
ley, Robert S. Hincks, Geri. T. L. Wat
son, Waldo C. Bryant, Nathaniel W.
Bishop, Henry A. Bishop, Isaac W.
Blrdsey and D wight C) Wheeler.
From the First-Bridgeport 'National
Bank, DeVer H. Warner, B. D. Pierce,
Jr., and Clinton Barnum Seeley have
withdrawn that they may be identified
with the Bridgeport Trust Company,
and Robert S. Hincks has withdrawn
that ho may remain with the institu
tion bearing his name.
From' the Bridgeport Trust Co. the
withdrawals include Charles G." San
rford, who was elected to retain the
presidency of the First Bridgeport Na
tional bank; Peter W.'Wren, who will
retain ,the vice presidency of the First
Bridgeport; Hamilton S. Shelton, who
remains president of the Connecticut
National bank; Waldo C. Bryant, who
will stilKbe on the directorate of the
First Bridgeport; Nathaniel W. and
Henry A. Bishop, who decided to re
main with the Connecticut National
bank, and Isaac W. Blrdsey and
Dwlght C . .Wheeler, who have
been connected with, the old Pe-
quonnock and Bridgeport 'National
banks, and will remain with the First
Bridgeport National bank.
Only one director retired from the
Connecticut National bank in the per.
son of .Gen. Thomas L. Watson, who
will still head the banking institution
bearing his name.
No changes were made in the of
ficials or directors of the City National
bank, .
At the banking Institutions affected
but little information was divulged to
day as to the effect the change will
have, though it was admitted' at the
Trust company's office that with a
directorate of 20 jrat of 28 remaining
no immediate attempt would be made
to replete the list.
At the First-Bridgeport and Con
necticut National banks it was admit
ted that the resignations had been re
ceived and would take effect immed
iately to come within, the Clayton act,
which specifies that no interlocking di
rectorates shall .exist after October 15,
but the question of electing successors
to the directors who had resigned is
not definitely settled.
Many of the financiers effected by
the Clayton Act long have been asso
ciated with the banking institutions
from which they were compelled to
withdraw. - The loss of association
means deep sentimental regret If- not
a deeper significance in the financial
world. - -
Every effort was made to secure a
ruling from the Secretary of Treasury
which would obviate the change. The
necessity for the change came directly
under the interpretation of the words
"substantial competition." It - was
felt here that the character of busi
ness transacted by the Bridgeport
Trust Co. in which a majority of the
directors interlocked was of such na
ture as it would not be construed to
be substantial competition. Directors
in the banking institutions placed the
situation plainly before the Secre
tary of Treasury in his capacity as
head of the Federal Reserve Board
but the applications to remain in both
institutions is said to have, been de
nied. .
As a result of the .final decision the
directors of the First-Bridgeport Na
tional bank and the Connecticut Na
tional bank met separately yesterday
to receive the resignation of their as
sociates which were accepted with
the deepest regret, Similar action
was taken this morning in the office
of the Bridgeport Trust Co.

CORONER URGES
PROTECTION FOR
GRADE CROSSING
Exonerates Railroad Com
pany of Blame For Hall
Street Fatality.
CITY SHOULD GUARD
PASSAGE, HE FINDS
Law or Other Means' Might
Be Invoked to Establish
Safe Public Path. ,
Strongly urging that the city take
steps for the establishment of prop
erly guarded public crossings at Hall
or Grand streets. Coroner John J.
Phelan this morning exonerated the
railroad company of blame for the
death of Edward L. Green, the team
ster who was killed Oct. 3 while
crossing the Berkshire division tracks.
The coroner said he could not hold
the railroad company liable, because
the records of the city and railroad
both showed there never had been a
public crossing at Hall street. Three
weeks before the fatality the railroad
company had erected a sign at this
point reading, "No Crossing. Danger
ous." In view of these facts the cor
oner found that Green was using the
crossing at his own risk.
In his finding the coroner says:
"The records and maps shown and
the evidence taken, as stated, upon
due consideration resonably convinced
me of the merit of the railroad com
pany claim that no public crossing ex
ists at the place named. .
"Failing, therefore, to find any evi
dence on the part of the city or rail
road company showing any formal lay
out of Hall street across the right of
way of the company since its !stab
lishment in 1839, I conclude the de
ceased was at the time of his death
using the so called Hall crossing at
his own. risk and further conclude
that Engineer Burns In the circusn
stances exercised such proper " man
agement of his engin in endeavoring
to avoid fatality as could be, expected
or required by law.
"I find, therefore, that the deceased
came to his death at the time, place
and from the cause 'shown and that
the same was accidental.
"In view of the undoubted import
ance of a properly guarded crossing
for public use at Hall or Grand street
or both, I strongly urge the authori
ties ff the citv to take the matter
under advisement that present dan
gers may be eliminated by the' estab
lishing of a law or otherwise, of a
right of passage at such places aa Will
be reasonably safe and convenient for
public use."
