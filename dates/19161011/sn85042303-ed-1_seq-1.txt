Not Backing Socialist Law.
Oklahoma City, Oct. 11. Ex-Chairman
Jake L. Hamon, who has been
one of the central figures of the re
publican organization far years, is
peeved because Chairman Gelssler Is

of the Roosevelt loaders In Oklahoma,
and always prominent In political af
fairs, bitterly denounces any attempt
to line up the republican party for the
socialist election amendment.
Ex-Chairman Hairon, in an Inter
fxn. mi., At I Hfarlflim
any Agreement between myself and
the socialist party or any of Its mem
bers toward adopting the so-called
fair election amendment to the consti
tution, but I am agamst this amend
ment and any other thing of like na
ture Initiated by the socialists that
tends In any way toward destruction
of any Important principle of our re
publican form of government.
'The proposed amendment unaouui-
v Is destructive of the principle or
rrep
ure
representative government In a meas
ure and robs our legislature of the
right to control our eUction machin
ery. I doubt the Judgment of any re
publican who supports this socialist
measure, and if I were speaking for
my party, I would unqualifiedly rec
ommend a vote against It."

Iondon. Oct. 11. The Morning
News-I'ress publishes conspicuously
and comments extensively on the of
flclul order of last night denying the
International News service further UHe
of the official press bureau because
of lis "garbling of messages and
breach of faith."
The Times says "It isn't because
Hearst Is anti-British, as the govern

resentment toward the Heart papers'
opinions. It is In consequence of the
deliberate falsification of which the In

repeatedly found guilty."
The Times says it hopes the order
won't bo regarded as a slur on the
character and consciousness of the
United States press as a whole, "as

TO STATE SOLDIERS HOME HERE
BUT AT PRESENT THE HOUSE
IS FILLED TO CAPACITY AND
THEY MUST WAIT.
At present there Hie 101 inmates
in the slate soldiers homo here and
tho house is filled to capacity. More
room could bo utallzed very handily
as there are on filo several applicants
for entrance who must wait until there
is room for them.
O. H. Bruco, treasurer of tho board
stated this morning that as there
were several who were contemplating
withdrawal or securing a furlough
that he thought there would be room
for some of the applicants before very
long. When the home was first erec
ted it was thought that it would bo
sufficiently largo to accomodate all
who would apply or admission, since
that time an annex has been erected
and it begins to look at present as
if another appropriation would have
to be made for another addition.
Superintendent Harris and Mrs.
Harris the matron report the health
of the Inmates exceptionally good
and nil seemed pleased with the sur
roundings. Mr. Harris Is the third
miDerintendent of the home since Us

that at times requires the greatest
diplomacy in order to avoid friction.
The one Inmate of the home In

be 104 years of age on the 20th of

and has many visitors every week
who come to wish her continued
