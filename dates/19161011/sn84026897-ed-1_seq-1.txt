The birthday party of Albert
Dozier of last Friday afternoon was
an occasion of great pleasure to all
his friends and all came with pleas
ant anticipations, for they already
knew how enjoyable an afternoon
could be with him. This was his
12th birthday and as each one ar
rived they presented him a pretty j
gift. There were all kinds of games,
the chief occupation later be
ing a cobweb hunt. Many colored
strings were about everywhere, and
a prize at the end of one. Every
one found a box of candy but the
longest string fell to the lot of John
Howard Black and he had to work
hard to win the prize for the string
caused him to climb two trees to
trace it and after various and intri- !
cate windings he came to a box
which contained a pet white rabbit
This was well worth the effort to
secure. All of the young folks were !
invited in the parlor where a vic
trola was giving sweet music and
all were served with ice cream and
cake. The afternoon was so pleasant
that only the evening shadows
caused the merry party to end.
The little babe of Mr. and Mrs.
Graham died on last Saturday after
a several weeks illness and the little
form was tenderly laid to rest on
Sunday morning in the Mt. of
Olives cemetery, the services being j
conducted by Rev. J. H. Thacker.

Everything conspired to make the

The devotions were conducted by

Very Interesting Re
port.
Dear Advertiser:- I suppose the
people in the old borne town and
county don't think often of a fel
low when he is away but I assure
you that those of us who are away
from the good people we love think
often of them. I am wondering if
the people would like to read a line
from me and of the work we are
trying: to do for the troops on the
border. When the Ohio troops were
called out I was in a summer train
ing camp for boys. Just as soon as
ibis camp was over our state secre
tary asked me if I would be willing
to give up my vacation and summer
school at Lake Geneva, Wis., and
give my time to work among the
troops. Of course I was willing to
do anything I could to help these
men for their temptations are many,
j We had some great experience at
Camp Willis, Ohio and we believe
of the work of the Y. M. C. A.
many a man's ideas were changed
for the better.When our troops were
asked to go to the border again our
state secretary asked me if I would
come down here as the representa
tive of our Ohio state committee.
What could I say but that I would
formy experience had taught me that
such work was worth while. Of
course it was hard to leave my
family and hard for them to give
rae up but here was a piece of work
that must be done and it seemed
that 1 was the man to head it up
and so I am here. It has been my
privilege to make friends with thou
sands of men and we believe we
have helped some of them. We have
a building here 40x120 that is
crowded to the limitai' ?*.?. '-:.v,' kV -
..j aua temptation. We
mid the officers and men believe in1
the work of the Y. M. C. A. Reli
gious meetings are held also. I
spoke to the men one night last
week and there must have been 2,000
present. After one of our talks a
boy came to us and said he had de
cided to change his life that he bad
not been home for 9 years. I wrote
to his mother and she wrote me a
beautiful letter in which she ex?
pressed her gratitude for the change
in his life. This is the kind of work
we are trying to do now and we be
lieve eternity will only reveal the
results. Our camp is located on the
very spot where some Americans
gave up their lives. Everything is
very peaceful here now. Here is
love for all of the good people of
my home town and county.
Your true friend,

Letter From Edgefield Graded
and High Schools.
The first regular meeting of the
McDuftie literary society for this
session was held Friday afternoon.
Quite a number were present and
the program rendered was splendid.
The first number was a humorous
reading by Annie Mae Culbreath.
She is naturally a good reader and
it is a gi eat pleasure to hear her fill
this part of the program. The cur
rent events by Lydia Brimson were
thoroughly interesting being a mix
ture of the principal public topics
and original high school ii ps. I am
sure the declamation would have
been fine had Mr. Lee Tiraraons
been present. Margaret May gave a
beautiful piano solo. The last num
ber on the program was the debate.
Resolved: ''That congress acted
wisely in passing the Adamson
bill." Affirmative, Onida Pattison,
Milledge Helston. Negative, Edwin
Folk, Genevieve Norris. The judges
decided in favor of the negative. In
the absence of the critic Professor
Bonner filled the place, his talk be
ing interesting as well as beneficial.
The old constitution was in some
way misplaced and the following
committee was appointed to draw
up a new one: Professor Bonner,
Edwin Folk and Ouida Pattison.
The following subject for debate at
the next meeting was adopted. Re
solved: "That a man's intellect is
greater than a woman's." Mr. Fred
Mays our new president is due much
praise for the splendid manner in
which he conducted the meeting and
we feel very fortunate in having
him to be general leader. We have
more members enrolled this year
than ever before and an unusual
amount of enthusiasm has been ex
hibited by them. Tho programs are
always very interesting and we ex
tend a p.ov??ial invitation to tho r??*?
uyvn uas uuuuiuuieua vast number
of Saturday Evening Posts and
and Literary Digests. These will be
very helpful to the literary debat
ors who often have to discuss po
litical topics. If anybody wants to
help the school in any way let them
contribute something to the library
for we need a much larger one than
we have at present. Should you
have two books alike or possibly
two Bets alike be kind enough to
place one of them in the school
library.
If you don't know the definition
of a word just come over to the
school and we will gladly let you
use our ne** Webster's dictionary.
It contains 2,620 pages giving every
possible derivation, meaning and a
full discussion of practically every
word in the English language.
The boys are going to organize
a basket ball team. We wish that
some other schools would do the
same so we can have some match
games between the boys.
