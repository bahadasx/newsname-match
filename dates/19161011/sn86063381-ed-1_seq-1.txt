Candidate for Representative From

Trip.
INSPECTS FLOOD DISTRICTS
NEAR RED LAKE AND RIVER
River From Highlanding to Red Lake
Should be Dredged and
Straightened.
Charles S. Carter, candidate for
representative of the sixty-second dis
trict, who recently made a trip of
inspection of the high waters of the
Red Lake and Red Lake river, has
outlined the facts of his trip in a let
ter to the editor of the Pioneer.
Investigation Conditions.
The letter follows:
Pursuant to an invitation of Be
midji citizens I accompanied Edward
J. Dugan, civil engineer of the United
tates war department and Senator
AP. O'Neill of Thief River Falls on
a trip across Red Lake and down to
Red Lake Falfe.
The trip was made by Mr. Dugan
solely for the purpose of investigating
conditions relative to navigation and
conservation of water, and reporting
on same to his superior officers who
may order a public hearing and at
"that time determine, if conditions
warrant, the Federal government in
I making a survey of the Red Lake
I basin and the river valley with refer
ence to control and navigation and
future conservation of water.
J We found the water of Red Lake
at about three feet above normal,
1 which, no doubt, results in overflowed
4.lands in the Tamarack and Shotley
river country.
But Little Fall.
C- After leaving the lake there is but
little fall to the river until you reach
what is known as Highlanding, a dis
tance of 27 miles by land from the
lake. The land along the river is
some of the most fertile land in the
state of Minnesota and when the Red
Lake river is properly dredged and
Jf* straightened from Highlanding to the
*^ke, the lands mentioned will then
*jome a wonderful agricultural real
and something should be done at
Once along that line.
At Highlanding a large delegation
^M of farmers met Mr. Dugan and Mr.
O'Neill and there was an interesting
discussion of the drainage question,
and among the other things, Beltrami
county was cussed and discussed.
The most important facts which
were brought out at this particular
meeting were that the farm crops
from Highlanding up the river had
been drowned out for two successive
years and that the settlers wanted the
river dredged and straightened, and
ft also wanted the state and federal
governments to pay for same.
We attended a meeting at the club
rooms of the Thief River Falls Com
mercial club at which time the mat
ter of drainage and control of the
waters of the Red Lake valley was
gone into by a number of speakers.
Dredge Stream.
The concensus of opinion seemed to
be that the river from Highlanding
to Red Lake should be dredged and
straightened and a control dam con
structed at the outlet of the lake. At
^Ktfeis meeting it was brought out that
inde what is known as the Nelson
acr, the Red Lake band of Indians
can dispose of their pine timber and
use the proceeds thereof in the drain
ing of their wet farm lands and with
co-operation on the part of the state
and the Indian department the drain
age project can be put through.
The trip from Thief River Falls to
Red Lake Falls was made in a canoe.
There are many fine water powers
along this route, in some places the
fall of the river being as much as 60
feet to the mile. The riparian own
ership of the shore along the water
power sites is practically all owned
by power companies. We arrived at
Red Lake Falls 20 minutes late to
catch the Great Northern train for
*^teookston and was forced to make the
trip by auto. However, we reached
the University Farm at Crookston in
K:' time to participate in and.enjoy th
sumptuous banquet splendid musie
t! and excellent and interesting drain
age talks by Congressman Steenerson,
Senator O'Neill and many others from
North Dakota as well as Minnesota.
From the intense interest shown
all along the way by settlers and by
the farmers and business men of the
Red River valley and by our state at
large there is no question but that
-the near future will see a comprehen
drainage system evolved, and
h8 Matured the
raisingdraif nfl #ith whicforto properly
the fertile farm lands of the great
Red River valley, and also to prop
erly conserve the waters for use in
dry years for domestic and water
pov#er use. Respectfully .yours,
Chas. S. Carter.

Ebbett's Field, Brooklyn, N. Y.^
Oct. 11.The world*s series now
stands three games for Boston and
one game for Brooklyn. Boston this
afternoon defeated Brooklyn by a
score of 6 to 2.
The summary:
Brooklyn 2 7 5
Boston 6 10 1
Boston entered the fourth game of
the titular series this afternoon in a
fighting, determined mood. They
fOught bitterly in ah attempt to re

mined to make the series two games
each.
30.000 Crowd.
The day was warm, the sun was
shining and the sky was cloudless.
The crowd arrived early, was in a
happy mood and the Brooklyn ca

Th-crowd-exceeded 3 0,(H0
The batteries^-were Leonard and
Carrigan for Boston and Marquard
and Meyers for Brooklyn.
No-Hit Hero.
Leonard is a no-hit hero. He
went direct to the Boston club from.
St. Mary's college, Cal., in 1911, but
was sent to Denver for further sea
soning. He made good with Den
ver, remaining there during the 1912
season and part of 1913, reporting
back to the Red Sox in the middle of
the 1913 season. He led American
league pitchers in 1914 and won one
of the games for the champions in
the last world's series.
Giant Cast-off.
Marquard is a Giant cast-off. Rube
came to the National league from In
dianapolis. He was known as the
$11,000 beauty and then as the $11,-
000 lemon, but McGraw made a reg
ular pitcher out of Marquard and the
star southpaw did quite a bit of shin
ing around New York before he was
allowed to go to Brooklyn in 1915
at the waiver price.
The Dodgers started the game with
a rush and 'scored two runs in the
first inning on two hits and an error.
The Royal Rooters of Boston were un
daunted, however, and the band
struck \ip the famous "Tessie" song
and march.
In the second inning, Larry Gard
ner, who knocked a home run in the
game yesterday, knocked another
homer and scored Hobby and Lewis
ahead of him, making the score at
the end of the second inning 3 to 2
in favor of the Red Sox.
Cheney in Box.
Boston scored again in the fourth
inning, making the score 4 to 2 at the
end of that inning. Lawrence Che
ney replaced Marquard in this in
ning after Marquard had allowed four
runs and five hits. Larry is one of
the most dependable of the Dodger
staff. He was formerly with the
Chicago Cubs.
Boston scored again the fifth on
one hit and an error. The Red Sox
scored again in the seventh on two
hits and an error.
Rucker replaced Cheney in thfr
seventh inning.
