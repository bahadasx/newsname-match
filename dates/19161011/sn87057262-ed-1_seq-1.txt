Attacks Underwood Tariff Bill, Adam-

[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
CLARKSBURG. W. Va., Oct. 11.—
Republican Nominee Hughes swung
westward through West Virginia to
day with his indictment of the demo
crats policies. He was scheduled for
four speeches, at Clarksburg, Parkers
burg,- Huntington and Charleston. In
each of these he planned to direct
the fire of his criticism mainly
against the democratic failure to live
up to the pledges of the 1912 plat
form promising protection of Ameri
can lives abroad.
Speaking here early today he caus
tically assailed the administration for
his handling of the Mexican problem
and solemnly warned his auditors of
the evil days he said were bound to
come it after peace among the war
ring European nations had been ar
ranged, the United States was forced
to compete in wtorld commerce under
the Underwood tariff bill.
Hughes* voice was strong and clear
—probably in the best shape, it has
been since he started to "come back"
lat Augustt- Today, fofr th£ first time
since lie assumed the responsibilities
of a presidential candidate, he began
to develop real orator's gestures and
to pull little tricks of speaking of
which Theodore Roosevelt would be
proud. He hauled out to be viewed
here today a first class uppercut
swing In driving pungent criticism of
the Adam son eight hour bill.
He mixed In a little slang about
coming back end "what do you know
about that"—in his speeches, all of
which struck his audiences here fav
orably.
What was more to the point, the G.
O. P. candidate has developed a very
keen sense of publicity now. Until
the present trip no one on his train
could make the nominee see the
necessity of preparing bis speeches in
advance. But Bince he left New York
Monday, the governor has found time
to dictate ahead of time, the main
points In his principal addresses,
enabling the correspondents to get
his punchy »tuff into print earlier.
Mrs. Hughes was back with her
husband after a -brief visit to her
home in Washington. She stood on
the stage with him today, her hands
full of picture post cards and buttons
and distributed in between hand
shakes.
Sermon on Prosperity.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
diARjKSBURG, W. Va.. Oct. 11
Candidate Hughes today made curt
denial of charges made by N'orman
Hapgood that there is an under
standing between himself and Ger
man propagandists. He did not men
tion the charges specifically, nor refer
to Hapgood by name.
"I have no understandings, no agree
ments, no intrigues wltti anybody,"
Hughes said, "but I stand for the In
terests of the United "States and the
protection of American lives, Ameri
can property and American com
merce throughout the world."
Hughes preached a sermon on
prosperity.
He deplored the present "unhealthy*
prosperity, declaring "Che hopes of
worklngmen are built on sand."
"Our friends on the other side," ha
-j said, "told us we were responsible for
the high cost of living.
They have not touched the cost or

If Germany Decides on Virtual
Blockade of U. S. Ports,
Protest Will be /-,
Made.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Corresvondent.]
LONG BRlANCH, N. J., Oct. 11.—
Secretary of State Lansing left for
Washington shortly ibefore 9 o'clock,
after a long conference with. Presi
dent Wilson last night on new vrob
lems raised by activities of the Ger
man submarine U-53 off the Ameri
can coast
The impression prevails here that
Germany acted entirely in accord
ance with her promises to this gov
ernment in her operations on British
shipping off Nantucket Shoals Sun
day. But .while methods employed by
the commander of the U-53 appear to
comply with this government's stip
ulations, the larger questions con
cerning the administration now is
whether the United States can tol
erate further submarine activities
outside her ports, menacing commerce
and constantly exposing to danger
the lives of American men, women
and children. There is a Strong un
der current of feeling against any
Buch continued practice which might
be contemplated by Germany. Scores
of telegrams have been received by
the president from business Interests,
demanding that sharp reminders
must be given Germany that she can
not virtually "blockade the ports of
the United States."
Some advise that the action of this
government should not be limited to
mere protest.
Officials here declined to comment
on what was this government's next
step in the new submarine problem.
Secretary Lansing would make no
statement whatever before leaving for
Washington.
After an early breakfast with Lan
sing, the president left for a game of
golf and nothing regarding his con
ference with the secretary of state
was forthcoming from the summer
white house offices. It is likely, how
ever. that steps will be taken at once
to get further information as to Ger
many's future intentions—if these
have not already been taken—and to
determine whether Germany plans to
make her campaign against enemy
shipping on this side of the Atlantic
permanent.

LONDON, Oct. 11.—Premier As
quith received a tremendous ovation
in the house of commons this after
noon when he declared in the midst
of a speech in which he moved f^ew
war credits:
"This war cannot end in
up, precarious, dishonoring compro
mise under the name of peace.'*
"This isn't the moment for faint
hearts and wavering counsels," added
the prime minister when the galler
ies were again silent. "The allies are
not vindicative, but they will require
from their enemies adequate repara
tion for the past and security for the
future."
The premier's declarations on the
subject of peace, came toward the
conclusion of an address in which
he asked new credits of |1,500,000,
000 from commons, bringing thek, total
for the war up to approximately $15,
•660,000,000. He followed this request
with a brief statement on the mili
tary situation, pointing out that in
the recent operations on the Somme
front. General Haig's men have ad
vanced their lines seven miles on a
nine mile front and hold all the con
quered positions.
His emphatic statement regarding
peace, lending new emphasis to
Lloyd-George's recent statement on
leace to the United Press, was con
strued by his hearers as Britain's fin
al answer to the recent peace rumors
emanating from the United States
and from Germany. The house of
commons welcomed it with a great
outburst of applause.
