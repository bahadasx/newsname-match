BOYS' CORN CLUBS
SHOULD GET BUSY
Ocala, FIa.r Oct. 111916.
Marion County Corn Club Boys.
My Dear Boys: Now is the time for
every boy in the corn club to begin
to get his record book in shape. Don't
ran to gatner your acre ana maKe a
rep"brt. If you have a small yield and
are a little bit ashamed; of it, just
show yourself to be a boy of charac
ter and report just what you made and
then prepare to do better next year.
I expect to give every boy a chance
to join the Pig Club for 1917, who has
his acre for corn well broken and a
cover crop such as oats or rye growing
on it by January 1st. Our pigs for
all boys will be -a small gilt from 10
to 12 weeks old and valued at $10.
Every boy in the club will have the
same size pig This includes the boys
whp are members of this year and
have grown "sows as they will take one
of their " small pigs and ; work with
that. It would not be fair to let
them have a grown hog and the new
members a young pig so all will have
the small gilts while of course the old
members will go right on with their
old sow and make money from her.
No boy will be elegible for the 1917
Pig Club unless he has his acre brok
en and the cove crop planted by Jan
uary 1st.' Of course a boy who is do
ing something which will take 7 the
place of a cover crop such as penning
cattle on his acre will be allowed to
enter without the cover crop but ev
ery boy mast have his acre broken
good and deep by January 1st. This
covers all boys, both old members and
new members. But in addition to this
no boy from this year's Corn : Club
will be taken into the Pig Club if he
fails to report on his acre and exhibit
his ten ears of corn at the Fair thi3
fall. . " . '
These rules are hard and fast and
must be observed by every boy who
wishes to join the Pig Club. Any boy
who does not follow these rules need
not apply. A boy who does not take
interest enough in his club work to
report is too sorry to have a . pig and
won't be allowed in the Pig Club.
Now we must all pull together and
work to make the Marion County Corn
and Pig- Clubs the best in the state
and it will take good work and plenty
of it as several of the counties are
doing better work at the present time
Remember that Marion county needs
ycur work and get busy; make out
your reports, select your best ten ears
of corn and be ready for 'the "Fair.
It is more creditable for you to make
a low yield and report than to try to
slide out by not reporting. I will see
every one of you before the fair and
go over your report and help you in
any way I can. Yours for success,
R. W. Blacklock, County Agt.

(Special to
Jacksonville, Oct. 11. The demo
cratic campaign committee has opened
headquarters in the Heard building
and gone to work to carry out the
general plan perfected at the commit
tee meeting here last Saturday. Sten
ographers and clerks were busy yes
terday getting out letters and shaping
up information to place in the hands
of the voters.
The committee has had prepared
and is nowjeady to be turned over to
the printer for publication a complete
illustrated campaign booklet showing,
by reproductions of the - tally - book
pages, errors made in various coun
ties by the inspectors and clerks of
the election and shows up in an un
unanswerable and convincing manner
how the votes of the other candidates,
on account of the misunderstanding of,
the proper method of counting second
choice votes were made to count for
Mr. Catts for the reason ' that his
name appeared first on the ticket. No
argument so strong, as these illustra
tions could be advanced to prove that
Catts was never entitled to have re--ceived
va certificate or to have been
considered the nominee of the party.
No democrat who will take the time
to examine the facts this booklet con
tains and has any respect for the will
of the voters, as expressed on the bal
lot, or for his obligation he took when
he participated in the primary, can
refuse to support the democratic nom
inee. - W .r ,.'-: 1 -vj ,.v r'l 'i ' -
f "Itineraries for speakers are being
arranged , by the committee and they
will be advertised just as soon as
completed. Mr. Knott will likely be
gin his campaign at St. Augustine or
Palatka and will open with a speech
either Friday or Saturday. Next week
Mr. Knott will likely go into Suwanee,
Hamilton, Madison, Taylor, Lafayette
and Columbia counties. From two to
three speeches will be ' made daily.
Picnics and barbecues will be arrang
ed and every possible efforfTput forth
to have a large- crowd to meet the
iiead of the -state ticket at all of his
appointments. Nothing will be left
undone by the committee to show the
democratic voters of Florida that they
have no justifiable reason for, desert
ing the-democracy to take up with in
dependents or the prohibition party
that is run by John P. Coffin and wife,
assisted by their son, who has been
nominated . to oppose Congressman
rank Clark, "democratic nominee for
Congress in the second district. In
formation is coming to the committee
headquarters from the second con
gressional district to the effect that
many of the Catts clubs have secretly
endorsed Mr. Coffin for Congress and
hat it was the encouragement offered
y these organizations that .prompted
Mr. Coffin to put his son in the race
j.or congress, uunng tne primary
campaign Mr. Coffin worked and so
licited, votes for Mr. Catts and it is
alleged that he has been making his
political headquarters in the same
rooms here in Jacksonville that are
known as the Catts club headquarters.
The convention that was held here in
Jacksonville a few weeks ago. and
nominated Mr. Catts was held in the
room that the Guardians of Liberty
and Patriotic Sons of America hold
their meetings. . The convention was
held behind closed doors and about the
only information that was ever given
to the public was that the convention
was held and that Mr. Coffin Sr. was
chairman, Mrs. Coffin secretary, and
Mr. Coffin Jr. was chairman of the
committee on platform and resolu
tions, and that they had nominated a
state ticket, headed v by Sidney J.
Catts for governor.
FUNERAL OF MR. LIVINGSTON

of his sons remained on the farm,
