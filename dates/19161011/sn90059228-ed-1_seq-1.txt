Warren High School opened the
football season in a spectacular man

all over their friends from Argyle.
The game began with a kick-off by
Warren. Ball was recovered on theLontest
opponents' twenty yard line by Paul
Bartholow of the local team. The
first play sent Capt- Mattson around
right end for a touchdown. i ^-j department.
The remainder of the game wj4&il
easy picking for Warren. Gains of
from ten to twenty yards were made
at will. At no time were the local
warriors held for downs or were
forced to put, while the Argyle
squad were successful but once in
making the required ten yards.
Team work and accurate passing
characterized the game for the War
ren aggregation. Interference was
quickly formed and effective at all
times, A record of no fumbles in
the first game of the season is a
mark of careful practice and clear
judgment.
The clean-cut consistent work of
the whole team makes it practically"
imposible to mention the work of any
individual player The spectacular
work of Jarvis of Argyle, however,
made him the center of interest of
that team. Although playing a los
ing game, his spirit never seemed to
lag. Warren will doubtless hear
him in the return game

reported. Indications are that there
will be a tremendous seed shortage
in 1917, as the supply of grain har
vested and threshed this fall, indi
cates a very low grade for seed pur
poses.
It is incumbent upon each commun
ity tQvtake up the matter of securing
&eed for the 1917 crop in order that
good seed will be secured. Reports
from the grain terminals indicate
that grain of superior quality was
grown in Montana, and is being
shipped through the Red River Valley
at the present time. Sufficient
quantities of good seed should be
bought now, and stored for use next
year. Every Farmers' Club and every
progressive village and town should
take up this movement in order that
seed grain of the highest quality be
secured before it is too late. There
should be no trouble in financing a
plan of this kind, as in all likelihood,
the price of grain will not be down
next spring Suitable storing places
for large quantities can easily be
found, but the best plan would be for
each farmer to secure what he needs,
and store it himself. Do it now-
