(Copywright 1916 by Associated Press)
TOKIO, Oct 10. Fears of a section
of the Japanese public, which have
found an echfj in the United States
and China that the coming into power
of the new ministry may be tanta
mount to war, were discussed frankly
today by Premier Count Seiki Ter
auchi, in giving to the Associated
Tress the first statement he has made
in regard to the foreign policy of the
administration. The premier gave ex
pression in a sentence to the spirit
which he declared wuld animate his
deaUngs with other nations.
Only Cause for War.
It was the assertion that Japan
would not take any aggressive
step toward the Unfted States or
any other country "so long as
Japan's vital interests acid dignity
are not infringed."

of mv career and a complete miscon-1

World Susp-cts Him.
The dramatic summons to the
pre-1
miership of Fiold Marshal Terauchi, i
Japan's dominating military figure has I
excited a discussion overshadowed by
no single event in modern Japanese
hisl'jry.
In view of the world wide interest
in the significance of hits appointment
and the misgivings it apparently has
caused, the premier, who has long bad i
the reputation of taciturnity, consent I
ed to break his silence and give to the
world through the Associated Press a
general idea of his purposes and poli
cies. During the interview he con
versed readily in French and then in
Japanese. The field marshal wore the
gray uniform of his regiment His
right ann, shattered by a bullet in the
Saigo Rebellion of 1877, hung power
less by his side. His rugged face,
stern in repose, relaxed with a smile
as he said:

"Tell the American people that my
earnest and constant endeavor shall
be to promote the friendly ties which
have bound Japan and America for a
half century.

The premier disclaimed respOnsi

with Baron Sakatani. who was quoted
as saying that the repeal of American
laws regarded bv the Japanese as dis
criminatory against them was a matter
of "justice and necessity." He de
clared emphatically that as premier
he would undertake no new step in re
gard to the so-called American pro-
blem. In this respect, he said, he
would follow closely the policies of
the outgoing cabinet.
"What will be Japan's policy toward
China?" the correspondent asked.

strikers were wounded, four of them

The strikers, several hundred in

the company and resisted the efforts
of a score or more of policemen to
disperse them. The officers were un

one of its leaders began shoo'ing and
the fight became general. Shots from
the policemen's guns soon dispersed
the strikers.
