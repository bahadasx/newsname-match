the outburst published at the head
of this column. Mr. Reed said he
"thought" that out as he stepped
from the train this morning. But
Mr. Heed's discussion of "The Teach
er's Privilege" showed a great deal
of thought upon the part of the learn
ed gentleman. The privileges of
which Mr. Reed spoke were summed
up about as follows: One privilege
was that of simply teaching; then
were the added privileges of being
trusted . educationally, financially,
morally and socially in the com
munity; of being a factor of civic up
lift, and of being an aid in the stand
ardization of the community. It was
a privilege, said Mr. Reed, to live In
the future, to foretell results, to em
phaslxe humanity and to Inspire to
iHttter things.
Second upon the program was Prof.
Deachamps, who spoke of "Child
Study." He advised the teacher to
learn his pupil, and to know the
forces that are back of the youthful
actor. A normal child, he said, was
a mischievloua child, and the teacher
Whould tie of happy disposition to deal
with the mischief-loving pupil. He
especially advised that the American
be allowed to do more for himself.

BbbeU Field, Brooklyn, Oct 11.
Boaton'i Red Sox advanced to within
a game of another world's cham
pionship this afternoon. They took
the third victory from the Brooklyn
Dodgers, ( to t. behind masterful
pitching by Dutch Leonard. The
crowd which packed the stands and
bleachers rooted hard and did its ut
most to cheer the Dodgers on to vic
tory. But they fell far short
They again showed weakness and
erratic field playing, having four er
rors charged against them. Altar the
first inning, when Leonard went
through everything except a cyclone, ,
lie was Invincible. The Dodgers got
to him for their only scores in the
Bret session. . , ; .. ,
Johnston opened the game with a
triple and scored on Myers' single.
Merkle'then walked, and a wild pitch
and aa error, and another run waa
accounted for before - Leonard got
back to earth and fanned Mowrey.
. The Dodgers then got to Leonard
for only three' more hits during the
remainder of the game.
Marquard started for Brooklyn, but
it was not his day. Larry Gardner
hung up his second home run of the
series oft Rube's offerings. Hoblit-
xel had walked and Lewis doubled, so
three runs came scampering over the
plate and put the Red Sox in the lead
right on the heels of the Dodgers'
two-run start
Manager Robinson engineered two'
pitching changes in an effort t6 stop
the Red Sox, but without avail.
Cheney relieved Marquard, but when
the Sox began to threaten -him, the
former Cub'twlrler failed and old
Nap Rucker was sent' in as a, last
hope. Nap delivered and' held Boston

The Dodger attack lacked the alp
