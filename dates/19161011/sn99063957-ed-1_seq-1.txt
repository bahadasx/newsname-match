BOSTON WINS EASILY;
DODGERS NOT IN IT
Brooklyn Batted Out fw je First But That Was AO
They Could Do Red Soi S.'ayed Them at Every Stage
of the Game Rube MarVHad An. Off Day and
Gardner Batted Him for a HomWcore Was 6 to 2 .
By H. C. Hamilton,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Ebbets Field, Brooklyn, N. Y., Oct. 11. Boston's Red
Sox advanced to within a game of another world's cham
pionship this afternoon
They took the third victory from the Brooklyn
Dodgers, .6 to 2, behind masterful pitching by Dutch
Leonard. The crowd which packed the stands and bleach
ers rooted hard and did its utmost to cheer the Dodgers
on to victory. But they fell far short.
They again showed weakness and erratic field' playing,
having four errors charged against them. After the first
inning, when Leonard went through everything except a
cyclone, he was invincible. The Dodgers got to him for
their only scores in the first session. Johnston opened the
afternoon's entertainment with a triple and scored on
Myer's single. Merkle then walked and a wild pitch and
an error, and another run was accounted for before
Leonard got back to earth and fanned Mowrey. The
Dodgers then got to Leonard for only three more hits
during the remainder of the game.
Rube Marquard started for Brooklyn, but it was not
his day. Larry Gardner hung up his second home run
of the series off Rube's offerings. Hoblitzell had walked
and Lewis doubled, so three runs came scampering over
and put the Red Sox in the lead right on the heels of the
Dodgers' two run start.
Manager Wilbert Robinson engineered two pitching
changes in an effort to stop the Red Sox, but without
avail. Cheney relieved Marquard, but when the Sox be
gan to threaten him the former Cub twirler failed and
Nap Rucker was sent in as a last hope. Nap delivered
and held Boston scoreless for the last two innings, being
nicked for only one hit.

f Ebbets Field, Brooklyn, N. Y Oct.
11 Threatened with having the world's
series knotted on them, the Boston Rod
Sox this afternoon squared off against
the Dodgers, determined to return home
for tomorrow's game with the edge still
iu their favor. Kendy again with their
justly celebrated defense, they clashed
with the walloping crew of Squire Kb
bets, grimly cognizant of the tact that
a defeat today will plunge them into
n air tight 50-.0 situation. A victory
would mean winding up the series to
morrow, providing the Boston bunch re
peat at home.

leaguers, the hurling corps,' has not yet

Had a Big Revolver But
Guard Walter Thompson
Gathered Him In
Another cook attempted to escape
from the penitentiary last night. When
tho prisoners were chocked for the
night the discovery was inado that Faf
ley Hunt, a negro trusty employed out
side the walls, was missing.
Guards were immediately sent out in
search of the missing man. Guard Wal
ter Thompson, acting on the theory that
the man would try to board a train at
tho Southern Pacific aepot, went to
that place and found that his theory
was good. Thompson came upon the
negro suddenly near the corner of 12th
and Mill streets, and although tho ne
gro was in possession of a loaded gun
disarmed him and took him back to
the prison.
The capture took place between 7:30
nnd 8 o'clock, and produced much ex
citement in the locality where it oc
curred. Guard Thompson made the cap
ture at the risk of his life. Ho was as
sisted in putting handcuffs upon the
eon Viet by Officer Victor of the Sa
lem police force.
Hunt is serving a term iu tho peni
tentiary for burglary committed in
Multnomah county.
Hunt was employed as cook at the
residence of Deupty Warden Sherwood.
According to a report given out at the
penitentiary this morning, he broke in
to a room in the deputy warden's house
and stole tho revolver which he was
carrying when caught.
NO PATCHED-UP PEACE
WILL 00 FOR ENGLAND
" 1 i
Results Must Be Permanent
England's War Debt
Loudon, Oct. 11. Premier Asquith
received a tremendous ovation iu the
house of commons this afternoon when
he declared in tho midst of a speech in
which he moved now war credits:
"This war cannot end in a patched
up, precarious, dishonoring compromise,
masquerading under . the name of
peace."
"This isn't tho moment for faint
hearts nd wavering counsels," said
the prime minister when the galleries
were again silent. "The allies are not
vindictive but they will require from
their enemies adequate reparation for
tho past and security for the future."
The premier's declarations on the
subject of peace caino toward the con
clusion of nn address in which he ask
ed new credits of $1,500,000,000 from
commons, bringing tho total for the
war up to approximately $15,000,000,
000. He followed thisi request with a
brief statement on the military situa
tion, pointing out thut in .the recent
operations on the Homme front General
Haig's men have advanced their lines
seven miles on a nine mile front and
hold all the conquered positions. j
HU emphatic statement regarding
peace, lending new emphasis to Lloyd
George's recent statement on peace to
tho United Press, was construed by his
hearers as Britain's final answer to the
recent peace rumors emanating from
the United States and from Germany.
The house of commons welcomed it
with a great outburst of applause.

Claim It Is Practically a
Blockade of America's
Atlantic Ports
LANSING AND PRESIDENT
DISCUSS THE SITUATION
Germany Has Kept All Prom
ises Made 'As To Sub
marine Warfare
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.) .
Long Branch, N. j., Oct. 11. Secre
tary of State Lansing left for Wash
ington shortly be'foro 9 o'clock after
a long conference with President Wil
son last night on new problems raised
by activities of the German submarine
U-53 off the American coast.
The impression prevails here that
Germany acted entirely in accordance
with her promises to this government-
in tier operations on British shipping off
Nantucket shoals Sunday. But while
methods employed by thecommander of
the U-53 appear to comply with this
government's stipulations, the larger
question concerning the administration
now is whether the United States can
tolerate further submarine activities
outside her ports, menacing commerce
and constantly exposing to danger the
live3 of Americun men, women and chil
dren. There is a 'strong undercurrent
of feeling against any such continued
practice which might be contemplated
by Germany. Score of telegrams have
been received, by the president from
business interests demanding that sharp
reminders must be given Germany that
she cannot virtually "blockade the
ports of the United States." Some ad
vise that the action of this government
should not be limited to mere protest.
Officials here decline to comment on
what Was this government 's next step
in the new submarine problem. Secre
tary Lansing would make no statement
whatever before leaving for Washing
ton.
After an early breakfast with Lans
ing, the president left for a gamo of
golf and nothing regarding his confer
ence with the secretary of state was
forthcoming from tho summer White
House, of rices. It is likely, however, that
steps will be taken at onco to get furth
er information pa to Germany's future
intentions if theso have not nlrnndv
been taken and to determine whother
Germany plans to make her cnmnaiim
against enemy shipping on this side of
tne Atlantic permanent.
