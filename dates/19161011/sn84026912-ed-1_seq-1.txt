Along New E
Six Ships Known to Have
dicate that Nine Wen
Submarines in Raid.
.Boston, Mass., Oct. 8.-The sub
marine arm of the imperial German
navy ravaged shipping oft* th? east
ern coast of the United States to-day.
'Pour British, one Dutch and one
Norwegian steamer wero sent to the
bottom or left crippled derelicts off
.Nantucket Shoals.
To-night the destroyer flotilla of
the United States Atlantic fleet was
picking up passengers and crews of
the destroyed vessels and bringing
them into Newport, lt. 1.
So far as known there was Ito loss
of life, though at a late hour the
crew of the British steamer Kingston
had not been accounted for.
A submarine- held up the American
steamer Kansan, bound from New
York to Genoa with steel for the
Italian government, but later, on es
tablishing her identity, allowed her
to proceed. The Kansan came into
Boston harbor late to-night for her
usual call here.
The hostile submarine is believed
to be the U-f>3, which paid a call to
Newport yesterday and disappeared
at sunset. Some naval men, how
ever, declared that at least two sub
marines are operating close to the
American shore, though outside the
three-mile limit.
The record of submarine warfare,
as brought to land by wireless dis
patches, follow:
The Ships Attacked.
The Strathdene, British freighter,
torpedoed and sunk off Nantucket.
Crew taken aboard Nantucket Shoals
lightship and later removed to New
port by torpedo boat destroyers. The
Strathdene left New York yesterday
for Bordeaux and was attacked at 6
a. m.
The West Point, British freighter,
torpedoed and sunk off Nantucket.
Crew abandoned the ship in small
boats after a warning shot from the
submarine's guns. Officers and men
were taken aboard a destroyer. The
vessel was attacked at 10.45 a. m.
She was bound from London for
Newport News, Va.
The Stephano, British passenger
liner, plying regularly between New
York, Halifax and St. Johns, N. P.,
torpedoed southeast of Nantucket,
while bound for New York. Report
ed still afloat late to-night. Passen
gers and crew, numbering about 14 0,
were picked up by the destroyer
Drayton and brought to Newport.
The attack was made at 4.3 0 p. m.
The Kingston, British freighter,
torpedoed and sunk southeast of
Nantucket. Crew missing and de
stroyer searching for thom. This
vessel is not accounted for in mari
time registers, and may be the Klng
stonian. The attack occurred at G
p. m.
Bloomersdijk, Dutch freighter, tor
pedoed and sunk south of Nantucket.
Crew taken aboard a destroyer. The
steamer was bound from New York
to Rotterdam, having sailed last
night.
The Chr. Knudsen, Norwegian
freighter, torpedoed and sunk near
where the Bloomersdijk went down.
Crew picked up by destroyers. The
vessel sailed from New York Satur
day for London.
Air Fillet! With Warnings.
Tho sensation created yesterday
when the U-4 3 quietly slipped into
Newport harbor and as quietly slip
ped away three hours later, was less
than the shock in shipping circles
when wireless reports of submarine
attacks began to come into the naval
radio stations just before day to-day.
Within a few minutes the air was
literally charged with electricity as
wireless messages of warning wero
broadcasted along tho coast.
The submarine, or submarines,
had taken a position directly In the
steamer lanes where they could
hardly miss anything bound in for
New York, or bound east from that
port.
Vessels of the entente allied na
tions and neutral bottoms carrying
contraband of war scurried to get.
within the three-mile limit of the
American shore. Several that were
following the outside course shifted
and made for +he Inside lano. Tho
Stephano, of the Red Cross line, how
ever, was caught outside the neutral
zone. The destruction of this vessel
wa? perhaps the biggest prize of the
day. The craft had been sold to the
Hus8lnn government and would have
been used as an ice-breakor after her
present trip.
Throughout the day and up to late
to-night none of tho patrolling fleet
maintained by the British and
French to protect their own shipping
and American ships carrying muni
tions of war had been sighted. Fran
tic appeals were sent to Halifax, but
for a time the commander of the
British naval station there refused
to divulge what steps were being
taken to meet the submarine attack.
Crows' Fate Still in Doubt.
Boston, Oct. 9.-No definite word
had been received up to noon to-day
of the fate of the crew of a vessel
recorded In wireless dispatches as
tho British steamer Kingston, one of
Wreck Shipping
England Coast.
Been Sunk-Reports In
t Down-Probably Three
the victims of German submarine at
tacks in the vicinity of Nantucket
lightship yesterday and last night.
These men, who were thought to
have left their ship before she was
sunk, were reported to have been
rowing their small boats some thirty
miles off the lightship early in the
day, but ti number of United States
destroyers cruised over a large ra
dius during tho forenoon without
sending ashore any message that
they had found the Kingston's crew.
Even the name of the sunken ves
sel remained in doubt. No steamer
Kingston has been reported in mari
time registers as having been in
these waters recently.
Three Ships Not lill> vu.
'Although Gie captain of the light
ship reasserted thal three subma
rines had sunk nine steamers, the
names of three of the destroyed ships
had not been determined. Neither
bad any ol' the submarines been posi
tively identified, although opinion
was almost unanimous that one was
the U-53, which called at Newport
Saturday, and passengers landed
from the Red Cross liner Stephano
quoted members ol' the crew as hav
ing been emphatic in their state
ments that the submarine which
sank the Stephano was marked
U-61.
Early In the day several of the lleet
of United States destroyers which
went to the rescue of the men, wo
men and children set afloat In open
boats brought Into Newport the pas
sengers and crew of the Stephano.
They also gave over to the care, of the
officers of the naval training station
at 'Newport the Dutch steamer
Bloomersdijk and the Norwegian
steamer Christian Knudsen.
Eyewitnesses Give Story.
Newport, R. I., Oct. 9.-Ono of
the destroyer Raich's crew said that
he saw a German supply ship attend
ing the submarine. The American
destroyers witnessed the destruction
of some of the vessels. In one in
stance the American boats were so
thick on the scene that the German
submarine commander asked the de
stroyers Benham and '.McDougall !c
make way for him to blow up hts
prey.
Eyewitness stories of the torpedo
ing of passenger and freight steam
ers by German submarines off Nan
tucket yesterday were told here to
day.
According to a report brought by
oillcers of a flotilla of United States
destroyers which picked up passen
gers and crews of several of the ves
sels destroyed, nine merchant ships
were sunk.
One of the submarines is supposed
to have been the U-53 which visited
tills harbor Saturday and another
was declared to be the U-61. Mrs,
Henry B. Wilson, of Williamston,
Mass., a passenger on Hie Stephano
one vessel sunk, said that an ofllcei
and several of the crew told her thal
they had distinctly seen Hie nam<
U-61 on the submarine that attacked
their ship.
Niuo Vessels Sunk.
Six vessels were known to ha\'<
been sunk and the report that tlx
total was nine was based on a state
nient of the captain of the Nantucke
Shoals lightship. The captain sah
that three submarines were engaged
The list of submarine victims includ
od four British, one Norwegian ant
one Dutch vessel. The identity o
the other three reported to have beei
lost had not been learned to-day.
It was believed that no lives ha(
been lost, and although the men o
the freighter Kingston were report
ed adrift in open boats, the fact tba
the weather was mild and the soi
calm made it seem probable that the;
would be rescued.
.'10 Americans on Stephano.
Of tho passengers of tho Stephani
30 were American tourists returniii)
from New Eoundland and the Canad
lan maritime provinces. All cann
through their rough experience with
out injury, according to officers o
the American destroyers, but los
nearly all their effects. Some savei
a few valuables, but their baggag
was lost.
Lieut. Commander Miller, of th
Ericsson, which picked up some o
tho boats from the Stephano, salt
Hint no attack was made on this vee
sol until all on board had left. Whei
the Ericsson arrived at tho lightship
Commander Miller observed a sub
marine about a mile distant, and al
most immediately beard three shot
from tho bow gun of the submersi
hie. Through tho haze ho cou!
dimly make out tho Stephano, th
object of attack. None of the shot
struck and probably none was aime
directly at her. Tho Stephano hov
to immediately and sent a message t
the Ericsson saying, "Please take o
our passengers."
Refore Commander Miller coul
get his boats to the side of th
steamer she had loaded all her pat
seagers in her own boats, from whlc
they were taken on board the d<
strover within llvo minutes. Thc
Stephnno was still afloat when tho
destroyer lett, hut was reported later
as sunk by a torpedo.
The Ericsson brought her 25 wo
men and ten children, while tho do- .
stroyer Batch brought t>9 others from
the Stephnno, Including passengers :
and members of tho crew.
Eighteen of the women were land
ed at the government pier hy permis
sion of the health officers and were
taken in automobiles to the homes of
Governor B. L. Beeckman, Mrs.
Kreuch Vanderbilt and Arthur Cur
t?as .lames. Dr. Andrews, who ls
connected with the Grenfell Mission,
was one of the four Stephane passen
gers (abeu to the home of Mrs. Cor
nelius Vanderbilt. Dr. Andrews was
on his way lo .New York. In describ
ing his experiences Dr. Andrews de
clared that the (?erinans gave tho
boat proper warning and then stood
by until all of the passengers had
been taken off .
None Left on Doomed Vessel.
Officers of the United States tor
pedo boat destroyer which had ar
rived in time to take care of the pas
sengers of tho Stephane) visited the
steamer," he said, "to make sure
that all of the passengers and crow
were safe. Then members of the
German crew hoarded her and open
ed her water cocks." He said no
torpedo was discharged.
While the Germans were engaged
in disposing of the Stephane, a Dutch
vessel, probably the Bloomersdijk,
standing a short distance away, "like
a steer waiting to be slaughtered,"
in the words of Dr. Andrews. She
had been warned by the submarine
to hold nj) as her turn was coming
next.
Dr. Andrews praised the work of
the American warships which went
to the assistance of tho distressed
vessels. Ho said they gave every
possible assistance to tile distressed
passengers.
Mrs. Henry B. Wilson, of Williams
town, .Mass., said that the passengers
were going to dinner when some ono
told them that there were destroyers
all around the steamer and that a
submarine was nearby. They thought
all of those wore American boats un
til the German flag was seen. Three
shots were fired across the bow of
thc Stephnno, .Mrs. Wilson said. The
steamer was stopped and all were or
dered to take to the boats. Tho pas
sengers did not have time to go to
their state rooms and saved none of
their personal belongings. The sea
was calm and all were transferred to
the destroyer Ericsson without diffi
culty. The Ericsson, site said, was
nearly out of sight of the stephnno
when thc liner sunk.

t'-itojits May Enter,
Washington, Oct. 10.-Tho United
States has refused to accept the con
tention of the entente allies, urging
that mutt raia deny the use of thoir
harbors io till submarines, whether
merchantmen or warships, Counsel
lor Polk, of the State Department,
announced to-day.
The allied governments in a mem
orandum lo neutrals called attention
lo "the grave danger Incurred by
neutral submarines in Ibo navigation
of regions frequented hy belligerent
submarines." Counsellor Polk an
nounced the department's position,
hut refused te discuss the reasons
fer lt.
The claim of the allies that subma
rines are outlaws, as lite note cabled
last night from London shows,
brought up the question of whether
the American government may bo
sued for damages resulting from the
call of the German submarino U-53
at Newport before she started on her
spectacular raid against commerce,
The allies may lake the position that
Newport was made the base for ope
rations, which officials estimate al
ready have caused at least $6,000,
000 damage to allied shipping and
trade. This government, however,
holds that a warship has a right to
enter a neutral barber and that tho
U-B3 in no way attempted to make
Newport a base.
U-Itont Sighted Off Tybee?
Savannah, Ga., Oct. 10.-Tho
presence of a submarine off the Geor
gia coast this morning was unofficial
ly reported to custom house authori
ties, and the British consul nt Sa
vannah. Un until a late hour to
night no official report of the pres
ence of the undersea beat had boen
received.
The submarine was reported as be
ing on the off-shore side of 'Martin's
Industry lightship, 15 miles east,
northeast of Tybee bar.' Neither the
British consul nor milsoms bouse au
thorities wtOUld state where their ln
formallon came from, although
stressing the fact that it was en
tirely unofficial.
From other sources, however, it is
understood that the information
came in the form of a wireless mes
sage from a ship at sea, picked tip
here Monday afternoon. Tho jnes
sage was being sent to Charleston,
it is understood, and reported tho
submarine, her decks slightly awash
and apparently In waiting. Her na
tionality could not be determined,
nor could it be ascertained whether
she was armed.
ItuKslmiH Got Two German flulw.
Christiana, Norway, .Oct. 9.-A
Russian torpedo boat yesterday sank
two Gorman submarines after tho
submersibles had attacked the Rus
sian wireless station at Sepnavolak,
on tho Murman coast, according to
information received here to-day
from Petrograd. Several persons
were killed by the gunfire of tho
submarines.
A whale struck by a harpoon has
been known to dive at tho rate of
300 yards in a minute.
