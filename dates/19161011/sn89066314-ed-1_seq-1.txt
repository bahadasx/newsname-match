HEALTH RESORT HAS
Excelsior Springs Organiza
tion, However, Caters Al
so to Social Needs.
INCLUDES i2S ACRES
Old . Log Cabin on a Hill
Forms Basis for Building
That Is Modern.
Perhaps the best example of a suc
cessful country club in a small city,
familiar to Columbians, is the golf
club at Excelsior Sprinsg.
Although primarily a golf club, the
organization affords entertainment
and recreational features of a country
club. Many Columbians visit Excel
sior Springs each year, and some who
have played golf over the new eigh-teen-hole
course have declared it to
be one of the best in the country.
Excelsior Springs has about 5,500
inhabitants. The golf club was or
ganized about ten years ago under
the supervision and direction of W. A.
Bell, an Englishman, who owned 500
acres of land on the outskirts of thc
city. At first a nine-hole course was
laid out and was used until last year,
when an eighteen-hole course extend
ing over 125 acres of natural golfing
land was opened.
The clubhouse is about a mile
from the center of the business dis
trict, situated on a high hill 200 feet
above the town. Before the golf club
was organized the district was con
sidered undesirable for residences.
Now the land has been platted,
macadam roads have been built and
the Golf Hill district promises to be
a popular residence districts
The novelty of the Excelsior
Springs club is the clubhouse itself.
On the highest point of the grounds
overlooking the town on the east
stands an old log cabin, built in 1S35,
when that part of Missouri was first
settled. When the golf club was or
ganized this cabin was used as a tem
porary clubhouse. When the time
came to build a permanent house, the
members decided to remodel and en
large the cabin rather than to build.
The original cabin is now the living
room of the club house. Wide porches
have been added, locker and shower
rooms for men and women built and
a garage constructed. The entire
clubhouse with all the remodeling has
probably cost not more than $2,000.
A professional golfer is in charge
of the clubhouse. He makes golf
clubs, repairs them and gives instruc
tion. His wife is in charge of the ca
tering service. Light lunches may be
obtained at any time, and special din
dcrs for large parties can be arranged
for in advance.
The Excelsior Springs club has
made arrangements for temporary
memberships for visitors. A member
ship committee composed of local
men passes upon applications for
membership. Visitors may obtain
membership cards upon recommenda
tions of members. A card for one
day costs $1; for a week $5; for a
month, $10. The yearly membership
dues are $50. Junior members are
admitted for $25.

War's Total $15,660,000,000
Bulgarians Invade Ru
mania From North.
By United Press.
LONDON, Oct. 11. Premier As
quith received a tremendous ovation
in the House of Commons this after
noon when he declared in the midst
of a speech in which he asked new
war credit: "This war cannot end in
a compromise masquerading under
the name of peace."
The premier's declaration on the
subject came toward the conclusion
of an address in which he asked new
credit for $1,500,000,000 from the
Commons, bringing thc total for the
war up to approximately $15,660,000,
000. He followed this request with a
brief statement on the military situ
ation, pointing out that In the recent
operations on the Somme front Gen
eral Haig's men have advanced their
lines several miles on a 9-mile front
and that they hold all conquered po
sitions today.
This emphatic statement lending
emphasis to Lloyd's George's recent
statement on peace to the United
Press was construed by his hearers as
Britain's final answer to rumors
emanating from the United States and
Germany.

BERLIN, Oct. 11. Bulgarian troops,

C. II. KRU.H BEFORE G. O. P. CLiTB
Wilson's Policy Discussed, Also Card,
ncr's Land Bank Hill.
"There i3 no national issue in the
coming presidential election, but rath
er a comparison of the two candi
dates" said C. H. Krum last night in
his address before the local Repub
lican Club at the courthouse to a
small audience. "Mr. Wilson has in
the last four years showed enough of
his personality and principles to In
cur the enmnity of the American
people and to brand as an unworthy
American citizen any man who will
go to the polls in November and vote
for him," continued the speaker.
Mr. Krum took issue with all of the
things which have been done by Mr.
Wilson.
Gardner's Land Bank Bill and the
eight-hour law also got a good share
of abuse and attack at the hands of
the speaker, the former as bias to the
fourteenth amendment and the latter
as a pure case of being scared into
the acUon.
