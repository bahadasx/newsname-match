Note to Entente Eejects
yiew Regarding Barring
TJ-Boats From Ports.
Washington, D. C. Oct. 11. The
American memorandum on use of neu
tral waters by belligerent submarines
df-clares the allies have failed to show
whv such vessels .hould be denied en
trance to neutral ports and thr-t no
circumstances have been set forth ren
dering the usual provisions of Interna
tional law inapplicable to under-water
craft. The T'nited States reserves com
plete liberty of action in dealing with
belligerent sutmarines.
No specific mention of the Deutsch
land is made in the memorandum, al
though the allied communication is un
derstood to consider that vessel as hav
ing no characteristics making her
status different from that of thf ordi
nary merchantman.
Pnta Responsibility on Ilrlligerents.
Surprise is expressed "that there ap
pears to be an endeavor on the part
of the allied powers to determine the
rule of action in reapect to the use of
submarines and at the suggestion that
there is great danger in permitting
neutral submarines to visit waters that
may be visited by belligerent subma
rines. The government declares that
responsibility for an conflict that
may arise Set ween belligerent warships
and neutral submarines nn account of
it', reglet of a belligerent to so dis
tinguish between these classes oi sub
marines must rest entirely upon the
negligent powers."
The memorandum, originally sent to
France. Great Britair, Russia and Ja
pan on August .11. in reply to their
identical memorandum of August
later -was sent also to Italy and Por
tugal. Text of Note.
The text of the American memoran
dum follows:
"The government of the United States
Vas received the memoranda of the
governments of France, Great Britain.
Kussia and Japan, in waieti bq
governments are exhorted to ta
ficaclous nuasnres tending to preffiST
belligerent- submarines, regardless of
their use. to avail themselves of neu
tral waters, roadsteads and harbors.'
The Kntente-a Contention.
"These governments point out the
facility possessed for such craft to
avoid supervision or surveillance or de
termination of their national character
and their power 'to do injury that is
inherent in tlieir very nature' as well as
the 'additional facilities afforded by
having at their disposal places where
they can rest and replenish their sup
plies. "Apparently on these grounds the al
lied governments hold that submarine
vessels must be excluded from the ben
efit of the rules heretofore accepted
under the rules of International law
regarding the admission and sojourn of
war and merchint vessels in neutral
waters, roadsteads or harbors: anv sub
marine of a belligerent that once en
ters a neutral harbor "must be held
there' and therefore the allied govern
ments warn the neutral powers of the
great danger to neutral submarines at
tending the navigation of waters vis
ited by the submarines of belligerents.
V. t. Jlxpressea Surprise.
"In reply, the government of the
United States must express its surprise
that there appears to be an endeavor
on the part of allied powers to deter
mine the rule of action governing what
they regard as a "novel situation' in
respect to the use of submarines in
time of war and to enforce acceptance
of that rule, at least in part, by warn
ing neutral powers of the great danger
to their submarines in waters that may
be visited by belligerent submarines.
"In the opinion of the government of
the United States the allied powers
have not set forth any circumstances,
nor is the government of the United
States at present aware of anv circum
stances, concerning the use of war or
merchant submarines which would ren
der the existing rules of international
law inapplicable to them.
Will Apply Principle of Xeutralltr.

EBBETS FIELD. Brooklyn. N. Y.. Oct 11. The Boston Americans
won today's baseball game, the fourth of the. world's series, by a score
of 6 lo 2 and now need but one more game to win the world's champion
ship for this year. Marquard went into the box for the Brooklyn Nationals
but soon lost- his control and was replaced by Cheney, who. after fanning sev
eral Red Sox, likewise lost control and was followed by Rucker. The crowd
was one of the largest of the season and the Brooklyn fans showed deep dis
appointment over the showing of their favorites who. after scoring twice in the
first inning, seemed rapidly to go to pieces.
The Dodgers went into the game hoping to duplicate Tuesday's victory
and thereby tie the score to date at two games won for each team. It had
seemed that Brooklyn's batting and fielding had improved aod that the pitchers
were working better, but today's showing did not bear out that belief.
