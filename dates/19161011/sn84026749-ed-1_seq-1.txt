Protesting against the issuance of a

Mr. Shoemnkor based his nrgmnent
on paragraph 2 of tho excise law,
uhich provides that no license shall bo
granted for any saloon or bar room on
a square, where less than SO per cent
of the frontago Is used for business
purposes.
In reply, F. I Sandoz, manager of
tho club, said It was the evident Inten

licenses, as It cxpiessly cxemtped clubs
and hotels In piovldlng that no bar

By PERRY ARNOLD.
United Press Staff Correspondent.
CLARKSBURG. V Oct. 11.
Candldate Hughes today made curt de
nial of charges made by Norman I tap
good that there Is an understanding be
tween himself and German propagan
dists.. He did not mention the charges
speclflclally, nor refer to Hapgood by
name, however,
"I have no understanding, no agree
ments, no Intrigues with anybody," he
said, "but 1 stand for the Interests of
the United States and the protection of
American lives, American property and
American commerce throughout the
world."
Hughes preached a sermon on pros
perity. Though his voice Is In splendid
condition, he saved It all possible, keep
ing his hat on became of the chilly
weather. For this he asked his au
dience of I.onn to pardon him.
Deplores Prosperity.
lie deplored the present "unheallh"
urosperity. dei'Jarltx? "the hopes ot
worklngmen aro built upon sand."
"Our friends on the othe islde." ho
said, "told us were were responsible for
the high cost of living. They have not
touched the cost of living, but they did
reduce the opportunities for making a
living."
Switching In nltl.clm of the Adminis
tration's Mo-lcan policy, Hughes as
serted: "I desire to see our peace maintained.
We csn do that, our friends talk auum
their policy, particularly In Mexico, as
though It were n policy of peaie. it
has not been a policy of peace. It has
been a policy of destruction of the lives
and property of American cltlscns be
cause of the withdrawal of the protec
tion to which thc were entitled. The
seizure of Vera Crur. the sla)lng of
hundreds of Mexicans, our own men
falling In hatllewns that pence's Tile

conflict, with a eisonal luler whom we
refused to recognize was that peace.
Only One Way.
"There Is only one wav In this
count rv to have permanent peace, and
that. Is to stand llrmlv for our Just
and known rights. The world de
sires our friendship, We desire the
friendship of every nation. You can
not tret it unless vou deserve It. I
stand here to say that nothing at this
time Is more Important than to main
tain the dignity of American citizen
ship and to show to all that we pro
pose to maintain our peace and se
curity and flrmlv 'cmandlng the rec
ognition of all our known rights,"
Hughes swung westward through
West Virginia today with his In
dictment of the Democratic poli
cies. He was scheduled for four
speeches at Clarksburgh, Park
ersburg, Huntington, and Charleston.
In each of these he planned to direct
the fire of his criticism mainly against
the Democratic failure to llvo up to
tht pledge of the 1312 platform prom
ising protection of American lives
abroad.

XKW YORK, Oct. 11. A close check
was being kept on the whereaboutH of

House of Commons this afternoon,
when he declared In the midst of a
speech In which he moved new ciedlts:
"This war cannot end In a patched

'masquerading under the name of
peace."
"This Isn't the moment foi r.ilnt

Britain, France, Russia, and
Japan Told to Beware of
"Consequences."
NOTE SHOWS GRAVE PERIL
Solemn Warn'ng Sent Entente
As Result of Issue Raised
By Deutschland.
The United States Government
in a formal note of warning has
served notice on Great Britain,
France, Russia, and Japan that
they must accept the grave conse
quences which will follow any at
tack on American submarines re
sulting from the allied campaign
against German U-boats.
Publication by the State Depart
ment of this note of warning to
the etentc powers has made it plain
I that the operation of German sub
marines off the American coast
carries with it the gravest peril to
American neutrality this nation
has faced during the war.
The newly announced position of
the United States was taken in re
sponse to a warning by the allied
powers that there was danger of
attack by allied warships on neu
tral submarines if neutrals permit
ted German submarines to enter
their waters, since it might be im
possible to distinguish between
neutral and enemy submarines.
Secretary of State Lansing ap
parently regarded this as a threat
and in response to the allied mem
oranda served this counter-warning:
In order, however, that there
should be no misunderstanding
as to the attitude of the United
States, the Government of the
United States announces to the
allied powers that it holds it to
j be the duty of belligerent powers
' to distinguish between subma
rines of neutral and belligerent
nationality, nnd Mint h re
sponsibility for any conflict that
may arise between belligerent
warships and neutral submarines
' on account of the neglect of a
belligerent to distinguish be
tween these classes of subma
rines must rest entirely upon the
negligent power.
The exchange of memoranda
took place after the German sub
marine Deutschland entered port
at Baltimore and the British gov
ernment sought to have the United
States order its internment as a
warship. Neither the allies' note
nor the. American reply was then
made public, however.
PUBLISHED NOTE.
When tho German submarine U-63
entered port at Newport Inst Sntnrdny
and Immediately on leaving port opened
warfare on British nnd neutral mer

the British government published Its

Accompanying publication of this note
an editorial from tho Pnll Mull Gazette
wus cabled to American papers which
contulned a veiled thrcut of tho danger
American naval vessels ran If German
submarines were given right of entry
to American harbors and then conducted

Tho British editorial which angered
Washington ofllclals said;
"In this kind of warfare (that of Ens
