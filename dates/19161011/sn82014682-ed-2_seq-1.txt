BROOKLYN, N. Y Oct. 11. Boston
hammered two Brooklyn pitchers out
of the box this . afternoon in the
fourth game of the world series, and
the Red Sox captured their third game
by' a. score of 6 to 2. Boston had the
"breaks,' luck and punch at the fin
ish, while Brooklyn pitchers were in
hot water at all times.
If you take a glance at the hit col
umn in the box score you will see that
.Boston outhlt Brooklyn 2 to 1, and this
will cause the average fan to believe
that Boston had by far the better
. pitching. The ;Sox outhlt' Brooklyn.

Kvery time a Boston' batter hhft the
ball to -the outfield with the exception
cf one occasion the ball hit safe. No
world series in the history of the game
has ever, presented a contest where
rne team secured the hreaks such as
' th Red Sox did today. . It was hitting
in the pinches that won, coupled with
-ihe breaks" of the game.
In today's game the Brooklyn out
field had ono lone rut out, while
Brooklyn batters hit, eleven balls - to
the outfield which were captured by
the Red Hose gentry, who guard the
outer, garden. . Brooklyn pitchers out

the mound for . Boston today, on a
ruruber.of occasions. But they did
not do It in the right place. Eleven
Boston batters were sent to the bench
rla the strikeout route, while only
three Brooklyn batsmen fanned.
When Boston needed a rim this aft-

the California boy how to pitch to

In a two-hour session of the loan
fund commission held In the govern
or's office today and attended by Gov
ernor Pinkham, loan fund members,
officials of the territorial hs'drograph
ic and of the city water departments.
the old question of Hillebrand; glen
and Nuuanu dam was again thrown
into the spotlight
Chief developments of the meeting
were a recommendation from Govern
or Pinkham to delay action "in spend
ing money to conduct water into an
admittedly leaky resorvoir;' a simi
lar recommendation from T. F. Sedg
wick; a proposal by George K." Larri
son of the hydrographer's office to
wait for further time to measure
Hillebrand runoff; a plea from Harry

Victory for Charles E. Hughes in

Most of the summer and early fall

Mr. Hughes deliver an able, forceful
address and one which, he thinks,
should impress the presidential candi

The local impression that the
president Is ldsing support because
of the Adamson eight-hour bill for
railroad employes Is confirmed oy Mr.

a boomerang for the administration.
