ABOUT ALLEGED EXTORTION
OF WILSON CAMPAIGN FUND.
Statement by Chairman Willcox of the
Republican National Committee.
New York, Oct. 10. Regarding the
attempt of Vance C. McCormick, chair
man of the democratic -national com
mittee, to repudiate the scheme, as it
developed in Texas, for the extortion
of a huge Wilson campaign fund
from postmasters and other federal
officeholders, Chairman William R.
Willcox of the republican national com
mittee had this to say today:
"Mr. MoCormick vents his fury on
the head of the unfortunate gentleman
from Texas whose letter to the county
chairman he ostentatiously repudiates
that he maintains complete silence
on the numerous evidences of similar
activity in other parts of the countrv.
He says that he publishes the Texas
letter because he wants the public to
understand that neither the president
nor he countenances for one instant
any such method of raising funds. But
several such methods of raising funds
have been employed by democratic or
ganizations in widely . separated parts
of the country for some time.
If Mr. McCormick is really sincere in
his condemnation of any such method
of raising funds, he has plenty of work
to ao in his tinea capacity as chair
man putting a stop to the activities
of his subordinates. For the democrat
ic bagmen are busy in widely scattered
parts of the country and the strong
arm method is specially favored by
them."
SHIPPING AGENTS ARE
GIVEN ANOTHER SCARE.
Tugboat Captain Reports U-Boat Be
tween Boston Light and Minot'a
Light.
"Boston, Oct. 10. Shippim- agents
here who have been holding their ves
sels in port on account of German
submarine activities off the New Eng
land coast received another alarm to
day when a tugboat captain reported
that he saw something resembling a
'j-ooai Detween Uoston light and
Minot's light early this morning.
The object was so distant and the
light so poor that the ctptain was
unable to say positively that he had
sighted a submarine, and the steam
boat inspectors to whom he made his
report were inclined to the opinion
that the failure it other incoming
boats to note the presence of a stran
ger in these waters cast doubt on the
accuracy of his obsprvation.
It was pointed out, on the other
band, that the roucrh son last nisrht
may have led a submarine commander
to seek quieter waters. The point
where the towboat captain saw tho
supposed U-boat is well within the
tnree-mne limit.
The tieup of shipping bound from
this port from Europe was still notice
able today, although no definite word
of the whereabouts of the German sea
raider has been received since the tor
pedoing of vessels off Nantucket last
Sunday.

Danger to Neutral Submarines.
In reply the government of the Unit
ed States must express its surprise
that there appears to be an endeavor
of the allied powers to determine the
rule of action governing what they
regard as "a novel situation" in re
spect to the use of submarines in time
of war and to enforce acceptance of
that rule, at least in part, by warn
ing rcutral powers of the great danger
to their submarines in waters that
may be visited by belligerent subma
rines. i .In.". .this oplnionofthe government of
the vl'niled States the allied powers
have not set forth any circumstances,
nor is the government of the United
States at present aware of any cir
cumsifinces. concerning the use of war
or n-i'B-chant submarines which would
render the existing rules of interna
tional l.'iw inapplicable to them.
Reserves Liberty of Action.
In view of this fact ond of the no
tice and warning of the allied pow
ers announced in theif memoranda un
der acknowledgment it is incumbent
uron tho government of the United
States to notify the governments of
France, Great Britain, Russia and
Js ran, that, so far as the treatment of
either war or merchant submarines in
American waters is concerned, the
government of the United States re
serves its liberty of action in all re
spects and will treat such vessels as,
in its opinion, becomes the action ot
a power which may be said to have
taken the first steps toward es
tablishing the principles of neutrality
and which for over a century has
maintained those principles in the tra
ditional spirit and with the -high sense
of impartiality In which they were
conceived.
Must Distinguish Between Enemy and
Neutral.
In order, however, that there should
be no misunderstanding as to the at
titude of the United States, the gov
ernment of the United States an
nounces to the allied powers that it
holds it to be the duty of belligerent;
power.s to distinguish between subma
rines of neutral and belligerent nation
ality. and that responsibility for any
conmct tnat may arise between bellig
erent warships and neutral submarines
on account of the neglect of a bellig
erent to so distinguish between these
classes of submarines, must rest en
tirely upon the negligent power.

JAPANESE ABE PEACEFULLY INCLINED
Count Seiki Terauchi, the New Premier, Allays Fears
of the Japanese Public
ASSURES THEM THAT HE
Declares Japan Will Not Take Any Aggressive Step Toward
the United States or Any Other Country "So Long as
Japan's Vital Interests and Dignity Are Not Infringed"
Asserts That No New Steps Will be Undertaken in Re
gard to the So-Called American Problems, Including Im
migration Guarantees That America's Interests
China Will Not be Harmed.
(Copyrighter 1916 by the Associated
Press.)
Tokio, Oct. 10. The fears of a sec
tion of the Japanese public Which have
found an echo in the United States
and China, that the coming Into power
of the new ministry may he tanta
mount to war were discussed frank
ly today by Premier Count Seiki Te
rauchi, in giving to The Associated
Press the first statement he has made
in regard to the foreign policy of his
administration. The premier gave ex
pression in a sentence to the spirit
wnich he declared would animate his
dealings with other nations. It was
the assertion that Japan would not
take aggressive steps toward the Unit
ed States or any other country "so
long as Japan's vital interests and
dignity are not infringed."
Shall Not "Wave the Sword."
"Any idea that I shall 'wave the
sword' while I am' prime minister of
Japan is based on. a false comprehen
sion of my career and a complete mis
conception of the Japanese empire, its
past and its hopes and ideals for the
future," he said.
The dramatic summons to the
premiership of Field Marshal Terau
chi, Japan's dominating military fig
ure, has excited a discussion over
shadowed by no single event in mod
ern Japanese history. In view of the
world-wide interest in tne significance
of his appointment and the misgivings
it apparently has caused, the premier,
who has had the reputation of taci
turnity, consented to break his si
lence and give to the world through
the Associated Press a general idea of
his purposes and policies. During the
interview he conversed readily In
French and. then In Japanese.
The field marshal wore the gray uni
form of his rank. His rjgnt arm. shat
tered by a bullet in the Saigo rebel
lion of 1877, hung powerless by his
side. His rugged face, stern in re
pose, relaxed with a smile as he said:
Friendly Feeling For Amerioa.
"Tell the American people that my
earnest and constant endeavor shall
be to promote the friendly ties which
have bound Japan and America for
half a century.
"Your people know my administra
tive record in Korea. Because I am
a successful soldier, shall that pre
vent my being a prudent minister of
state? Say it, repeat it, that I come
as a statesman who is seeking the
lasting interests of my people, not as
a militarist seeking glorification by
the sword."
Not Responsible For Interview
The premier disclined, responsi
bility for the interview in New York
with Baron Sal?atani, who was quoted
as saying that the repeal of American
laws regarded by the Japanese as dis
criminatory against them was a mat
ter of "justice and necessity." He de
clared emphatically that as premier he
would undertake no new steps in re
gard to the so-called American prob
lems, including immigration. In this
respect, he said, he would follow close
ly the policies of the outgoing cabi
net. '
BRITAIN IS RETICENT ON
NEW SUBMARINE ACTIVITY.
AH Departments of Government Are
Refraining from Comment.
London, Oct. 10. All departments of
the British Government are maintain
ing a poiicy of refraining from com
ment on the American attitude toward
the German submarine activities off
the American coast- i
Walter Hines Page, the American
ambassador, had a conference with
Viscount Grey, the British secretary for
foreign affairs, this afternoon, but the
purpose of the ambassador's visit was
to discuss questions which President
Wilson and Secretary Lansing had
discussed with Mr. Page before the
ambassador left the United States.
Tho submarine question was not a part
of the program and was not raised,
unless by the foreign secretary.
The submarine campaign continues
to be the chief topic in the English
newspapers. The fact that the United
States had protested against the patrol
of British cruisers near the American
coast was not generally known here
until the German submarine visit
raised discussion of the whole ques
tion. Naval writers now maintain that the
Washington government having pro
tested -against the presence of British
cruisers on the American coast, can
not fairly countenance this submarine
campaign, which they hold constitutes
far greater cause for complaint and
protest than any which could 'have
been based on British naval move
ments. '

WILL NOT WAVE SWORD
in
Policy Toward China.
"What will be Japan's policy to
wards China?" the correspondent ask
ed. "As the ministry was organized only
yesterday, I have not discussed China
with my associates," he replied. "How
ever, speaking generally, Japan's am
bition is to have China benefit, like
Japan, from the fruits of world civil
ization and world progress. The Jap
anese and Chinese people have sprung
from the same stock. Our future des
tiny is a common destiny that is his
torically involved."
Though he was unable to dwell on
a detailed programme, the premier
continued, he could affirm that Amer
ican's interests in China would be
harmed in nowise by Japan, which had
no intention of violating China's sov-,
ereignty or preventing interested na-'
tions from having equal opportunl-'
ties.
"People talk of closing the door," he
said. "That is a complete non pos
sum us.
"So long as Japan's vital intreests
and dignity are not infringed, Japan
will take no aggressive step against
any nation, especially America."
"Will the Japanese alliance with
Russia be the basis of policy In the
Orient?" he was asked.
Alliances With Great Britain and
Russia.
"Japan, true to her obligations.
naturally will he bound In her future
policies by her alliances with Great
Britain and Russia," he responded,
"but that does not imply disregard of
fostering amity with others, notably i
America, . whose friendship and co-
operation we have every, reason to j
cherish. The empire faces a sitna-:
tion which demands strenuous and
unified exertions to secure reforms of i
the national life, to nourish the
strength of her resources and to place
the nation on an unshakable founda
tion of secure and lasting peace In the
Far East. Our supreme efforts abroad
should be to maintain faith with for
eign powers and to be strictly fair,
and upright. Japan's progress an &
world power, which is inevitable, must!
he marked with prudence and caution,.1
especially in the period of world cris
is." No More Aotlvtty in War.
The premier said he saw no IikeTV
hood of more activie participation In
the war by Japan. He ridiculed sus
picious that Japan had designs In re
gard to the Philippines, saying that
if any power were to be there he was
glad 11 should be America.
Concerning the contention that the
cabinet was reactionary and that Its
creation was opposed to the rights of.
the people, the premier said, with mill,
tary brevity: ,
"My appointment is in exact accord
ance with the provisions of the Japan-
ese constitution." .-
, Construotive Programme.
"Not revolutionary, nor aggressive,
not militarystic, but constructive,
that is my programme," declared the
premier in conclusion. j
