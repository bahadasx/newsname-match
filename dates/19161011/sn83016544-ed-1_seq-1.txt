TOFTE COMMUNITY CLUB
HOLD INTERESTING MEETING
Under the working scheme of the
Tofte Community Club, the duty of
entertaining at the regular monthly
meetings is distributed among the
members, Mr. and Mrs. L. A. Godin
being the ones to provide the enter­
tainment at the last meeting held
last Saturday evening at the Tofte
town hall. The hall was crowded to
its fullest capacity by club members
and visiting friends, including a
large number form Maple Hill and
Grand Marais, and from start to fin­
ish the event was thoroughly en­
joyed by all present.
An interesting program was ren­
dered, consisting chiefly of an illus­
trated lecture on the poultry indus­
try by Wm. Clinch, followed by an
appropriate talk by Mr. Clinch on
cooperation and community work
generally In a short congratulatory
talk by S. C. Murphy the people of
Tofte were highly complimented,
and deservedly so, on the progress
and thriftiness of the community,
so convincingly evidenced on every
hand.
Following the program, a dance
was given and" at midnight lunch
was served.
The next similar event of interest
will be the dedication of the new
school building, the construction of
which is being pushed rapidly to­
wards completion. This new build­
ing, which is surely a monument to
Tofte enterprise, will be ready for
dedication in a few weeks, and it is
planned to make this a memorable
event in local history.

AN OLD LANDMARK
DESTROYED BY FIRE
The Bay View Hotel Building
Burned Down Early Last
Monday Morning.
Our citizens were awakened by the
fire alarm on Monday morning at
three o'clock to find the old Bay
View Hotel building in flames. The
fire apparatus was brought into play
and the fire was confined to that
building, although before the stream
form the fire hose was brought into
action it looked as if the hospital,
which was but a few feet away, was
doomed and only the energetic work
of a bucket brigade with blankets
on the roof and walls of the hospi­
tal kept that building from catch­
ing fire before the streams from the
fire engine were available.
The origin of the fire is unknown.
A cigar factory was operated by
Geo. Brisson on the second floor, the
rest of the building being vacant,
and he had left the building in the
evening about ten o'clock, having
done a little work there. While
sleeping at the dock he was awaken­
ed by his dog who sensed danger and
getting up to put the dog out in
another room, he saw the flames
coming out of the windows of the
building.
The destruction of the building,
which was one of the first construc­
ted in our village, has brought out
some interesting facts regarding our
real pioneer days. The building was
constructed about 1880 by Henry
Mayhew. Among those who assisted
in the work were Fred Jackson, John
Drouillard and Sam Howenstine.
The first school in the county was
held in the front room of the build­
ing, the teacher being Mr. Ben Wil­
bur. Among those who attended
school there were Jas. G. Scott, Mrs.
Louis Engelson, Mrs. Fred Bramer,
and Benjamin Scott. The school
district at that time comprised the
whole county and the directors of
the district were A. J. Scott, Henry
Mayhew and Joseph Mayhew.
LYCEUM COURSE CON­
SIDERED BY LOCAL SCHOOL
Supt. M. R. Beebe is considering
signing up with a Lyceum bureau for
a series of five high class entertain­
ments to be given at the school
house during the course of the win­
ter. The course will consist of a va­
riety as is usually offered in such
contracts and will include quartet,
bell ringers, vocal and instrumental
music, a humorist, and other high
class entertainment. This commun­
ity has heretofore not had the op­
portunity of having such a course
and we believe it would be well re­
ceived by the people of the com­
munity. It is now the practice of
most villages of this size and larger
to give such a course once a year
and it is very seldom that the enter­
tainments sent out by a responsible
Lyceum Bureau fail to please the
public.
If the contract for the entertain­
ments is accepted, season tickets for
the series will be sold, making the
cost of each number very small to
those buying tickets for the entire
season. Supt. Beebe will take the
matter up with some of our citizens
and if the plan is well received, he
will sign up for the series. The pro­
fits from the entertainments, if
there are any, will be used for the
purpose of buying school appara­
tus.
J. Alvin Johnson, who recently mo­
tored to Grand Marais, writes back
"Made the trip to Duluth from
Grand Marais in five hours and fif­
teen minutes, some roads." Yes,
and some car and driver too, Mr.
Johnson.
The building of a temporary
bridge across the Pigeon River has
been abandoned as it has been found
that permission to build the cross­
ing will have to be given by Congres
according to Mr. E. J. Filiatrault,
who was in the village the first of
the week.
Mr. and Mrs. H. Oldenberg and
daughter Margaret of Carlton, Minn,
and Miss C. Sampson, of Seymour,
Wis., motored to Grand Marais last
Friday. On Saturday morning they
left for the interior of the county
with Ranger P. J. Bayle for a weeks
sightseeing.
We are publishing on the next to
the last page of this issue the eight
proposed amendments to4he Consti­
tution of the State of Minnesota
which will be voted upon at the
coming election. Amendment No 1
creating a revolving fund for the de­
velopment of school lands should re­
ceive our special attention as it will
be of great benefitin the develop­
ment of Northern Minnesota.
COMMENTS FROM SCHROEDER
Mr. Redmyer has built a passway
over Cross River a little below the
old bridge, which was destroyed
with axe and fire during the night
of the 4th of July by a crew of
neighbors, as described before in
this paper.
The shed erected for the shelter
of the tools of the Town of Schroe­
der is still lying in a sad condition
on the ground torn down and moved
to its new site beside the auto road
on Ely Smith's land. All the ma­
chines and tools belonging to the
town are like the shed in a pitiful
sight, exposed to rain and all sorts
of weather and temperatures. Rust
and water in the pores and crevices
of the poor tools «(ill combine to
bring them to an early destruction
and every honest passerby views
with sorrow the negligence with
which the peoples' belongings (and
money) are treated. The energies
wasted on the unnecessary devasta­
tion of Cross River bridge would
have erected the toolshed. The world
is full of fun.
Schroeder town now boasts to be
in line with the wonderful time in
which we live. The automobile has
received a homefteven with one of
our citizens. Mr. W. C. Smith being
in possession of no less than two of
them.
By the way is it not a remarkable
thing for us old-timers to witness
the new era which the opening of
the highway has brought to us? The
other day when we were bouncing
homeward from a trip to the post
office for instance (it was in the
dusk and the sun had already set)
afire was seen blazing in the dis­
tance. Frightened at the thought
of a possible forest fire of the old
type, we hastened our steps only to
find a cosy camp fire by the road­
side, in front of it a big touring
car, and encircling it a party of city
dwellers playing Indians. Our heart
swelled with joy at this sight and
we realized in full the advantage
brought us by the new road, that
has made us one with the rest of the
world and delivered us from the iso­
lation in which we heretofore were
shut up by the boundless unbroken
forest on one side and the vast wa­
ters of Lake Superior on the other.
Who is this Mr. McCullough whc
comes here in his auto and announ­
ces his wish to become our repre­
sentative in the legislature? He
makes

explanation what he in­
tends to do or work for, neither or­
ally or in our local paper. And who
is his opponent, if one there is?
Is it not about time for Cook
county to install one of its wn sons
among the lawmakers? Hr.ve we not
among us some one who can say
with one of the Scandinavian forefa­
thers: "From under this cloak a
king could perhaps also ba shaken
forth." The farmers should be more
represented in our legislative bodies
than they are, and so should the
pliers of the trades, could we not
send Mr. Hans Engelsen? If only the
legislature convened in Two Harbors
or Grand Marais instead of in St.
Paul, we wish.

His Recommendation
A young man found it difficult to meet the
request for a recommendation when he sought
anew position in a strange city.
Finally he thought of his bank book and at
the next interview produced the same as a re­
commendation of his thrift and industry.
The novelty of the idea linked with the
continuity of deposits shown by the book, se­
cured the position for him without further in­
quiry.
Have you a recommendation of this kind
to back you, should you lose your present po­
sition? If not, get a pass book today and de­

A Disappointed Chfc^^^^*arty.
The Birchwood vicinity was start­
led Friday when the news came that
one of their most prominent young
bachelors of this vicinity was to ar­
rive Sunday night with a bride.
They arrived in Hovland Sunday
night and were conveyed to the
Birchwood vicinity by auto Monday
stopping at his sister's, Mrs. R.
Smith, an enjoyable day was spent,
when after supper the bridal pair
stepped out into a summer house to
enjoy a few minutes quietness when
by chance they saw a mysterious
party marching along the road in
single file laden with noisy instru­
ments. The bride not being accus­
tomed to such music became fright­
ened Und asked her husband if they
could be soldiers that crossed the
line from Canada, he assured her
that there was no danger and being
interested stepped out under the
shade of the forest trees of maple
and birch in the nature beauties of
the North Shore scenery, as they sat
thus, wrapped in their furs of com­
fort behold they saw coming back
the same mysterious party filing
back down the road and they had
in their midst three female captives
it was then the bride was more sure
that they were soldiers but as they
heard their names mentioned it was
then, and then only, that they were
the party in quest.
The writer is in sympathy with
these wanderers and being person­
ally acquainted with the groom
would like to say that under no
consideration would the groom have
dissappointed this mysterious party
if they had known their intention.
