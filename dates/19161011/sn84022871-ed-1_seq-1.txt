Our Approaching Lecture Course.
The announcement of the 1916
1917 Barton lecture course to be
managed by the Barton Improvement
club this year, was made in these
columns a few weeks ago. One
change has been made and the cor
rected talent and dates are as fol
lows: Wednesday, November 15, the
Weatherwax Brothers quartet.
Thursday, December 14, Katharine
Ridgeway.
Saturday, February 10, Laurant
and Company.
Friday, March 2, a triple number
made up of the Marigold Ladies'
Quartet, Ethel Hinton and Pietro
Verdi.
Wednesday, March 21, Nelson Dar
ling, fi
The course is by far the most ex
pensive of any in recent years and
promises to be the best. The man
agement believing it impossible to
conduct such a course as they have
engaged for the former price have
raised the course tickets to $2.
Katharine Ridgeway and Laurant
are not strangers to Barton. Next
to Russell Conwell, Katharine Ridge
way holds a place in the hearts of
Barton . lecture course-goers and
Laurant's magical entertainment
was by far the best ever seen in Bar
ton. He comes this year with new
magic and a much larger show than
ever.
The Weatherwax Brothers quartet
is an exceptionally fine male quartet
and those who know say the triple
number as mentioned above with the
Marigold Ladies' quartet starring
will be another musical treat. This
quartet is accompanied by Ethel Hin
ton, reader, and Pedro Verdi, piano
and accordion artist.
Nelson Harding, lecturer, has an
enviable reputation in the Middle west
and brings his hearers a message
wholly different, it is said, from most
lecturers.

Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
Rev. I. A. Ranney, Pastor
You are cordially invited to attend
all services.
Morning worship, 10.45.
Sunday school, 12 o'clock.
Epworth League, 6 o'clock.
Evening service at 7 o'clock.
Prayer meeting Thursday evening
at 7.30.
The subject of the Sunday morning
sermon was. "Wanted: A man to
Stand in the Gap," the text being
taken from Ezekiel 22:30. "I sought
for a man among them that should
make up the hedge and stand in the
gap before me in the land."
. Below are a few pertinent para
graphs from it:
"The need of a man to 'make up
the hedge and stand in the gap' for
Jerusalem of old was not a need pe
culiar to that time and place only, but
one that has been felt most keenly in
every land and nation. More than
that, every organization in existence
has been sensible of the lack of a man
to stand in the gap.
"There are many gaps in the church
that need filling. There are gaps in
the preaching services empty pews
gaps in the Sunday school, in the
teaching force, in the prayer meeting,
in the family altar. God is seeking
for men (and sometimes the call for
a man means a woman) to fill them.
"No longer say, 'I pray thee, have
me excused,' but come to the front,
saying with Isaiah, after he had seen
the vision in the temple, 'Here am I;
send me.' "
The evening sermon was from the
words of Jesus in Matthew, "I will
build my church," showing the impor
tant place the church holds in the
world, and the responsibility of the
individual m the church, t
The Afternoon Study club held the

Barton Academy and
Graded School
The training class, together with
the other classes registered for home
economics, are much interested in the
exhibit which Barton academy will
send to the North Atlantic Boys' and
Girls' exposition held at Springfield,
Mass., Oct. 13. As the time was
short the department found it impos
sible to undertake a large projer.fc,
but determined to make up in quaUty
what might be lacking in quantity.
Under the skillful and practical in
struction of Miss Pierpont, the young
ladies canned by the cold pack meth
od six quarts of peaches and six
quarts of tomatoes. These will be
shipped to Springfield Saturday, and
will, we hope, win at least honorable
mention. But should they receive no
recognition, the young ladies feel ful
ly repaid for their work by the ex
perience they have gained, the knowl
edge they have acquired, and the in
terest that has been aroused. Be
sides the products mentioned, the
classes have made crab apple jelly
and sweet cucumber pickle.
This work is especially valuable
for the members of the training class
as in their work the emphasis is
placed on the needs of the rural com
munities and on what may be done
with the equipment possible to any
rural school. A study is also being
made of food values, of school lunch
es, and of what hot dishes can be
prepared to supplement the cold
lunches brought by the children.
The training elass began their
work in geography with a study of
local geographical conditions. The
discussion of the questions:
How does Barton village serve the
town of Barton?
How does Barton village serve the
state of Vermont?
How does Barton village serve the
United States?
led to a detailed study of the loca
tion of Barton with reasons for the
same; an examination of the topog
raphy of the surrounding country
and plans to visit the various indus
tries of the village.
The first expedition, on Thursday,
was to the outlet of Crystal lake and
to the dams along the course of the
river, for the purpose of ascertaining
the source of Barton's water power
and of understanding the means by
which it is utilized. The class then
went to the Peerless, where Mr. Un
derwood most kindly showed them
the workings of the water wheel and
explained how the power was con
veyed to the machinery. Through
Mr. Underwood's courtesy, the class
will be allowed to make another vis
it to study more carefully the geo
graphical - interests represented by
the factory.
Notwithstanding the seriousness
of purpose, kodaks were not barred
from the expedition.
Two most engaging pets add to the
interest of the training room.
PARENTS' NIGHT.
Friday evening, Oct. 20, has been
set aside for the parents of the chil
dren, who are attending Barton acad
emy and graded school. Every par
ent is urged to come because the
school is anxious to have the teachers
and parents become acquainted, and
even more, because the faculty wish
es parents to feel at home in the
school and to be at liberty to visit it
whenever they desire to do. In this
manner the parent may learn what
the school is trying .to do for the
child, and the school may also profit
by ascertaining what the individual
parent wishes done for his or her
own particular child. A program of
unusual interest is being prepared
for parents' night, the entire school
plant will be at the disposal of the
parents, and a thorough inspection of
the school's facilities is urci upon
all.
School will be suspended from Wed
nesday afternoon until Monday morn
ing, in order that the teachers may
attend the annual meeting of the
State Teachers association which will
be held in Burlington, October 12, 13
and 14. Nearly all the high and
grade teachers are planning to at
tend the convention.
Frank Marshall of St. Johnsbury
Center has been visiting friends here.
Rev. Mr. Rankin of Newport will give
a stereopticon lecture at the church
Oct. 18, on "Immigration."
The dance at the M. W. A. hall this
week will be omitted. On Friday eve
ning, Oct. 20 will be the next one.
The Ladies auxiliary of the M. E.
church will serve a harvest supper,
Wednesday, Oct. 18, followed by an en
tertainment. Mrs. W. S. McDowell died suddenly
Tuesday forenoon of heart failure. Fu
neral services will be held at her late
home Friday morning, at 10 o'clock.
IDEALS NECESSARY.
Nothing is so practical as the
ideal. The ideal Is the basis of
the practical, the prophecy of
the practical, the creator of the
practical. The ideal has molded
the world from barbarism to
semicivilization and will mold it
to a civilization worthy of the
name.- It is the power that
molds men and women and in
stitutions and nations as a pot
ter molds his clay. Every book
and every nation was an ideal
before it was a fact and became
a fact because of the creative
power of the ideal. Professor
Frank Parsons.
