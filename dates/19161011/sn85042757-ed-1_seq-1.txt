the ginger and clean cutting power in
to a public speech that "Little Hen"
can and if you want to hear the issues
of the campaign handled in a vigorous
and telling manner you will not fail to
hear him. There is not a republican
or democrat either in this county who
can afford to miss hearing him. Be
sure you come out and bring your
neighbors with you.
Republican headquarters, following
the weekly report from all corners ot
the state, teel more condfient this week

Working on the Cove Mountain, East
End of Memphis-to-Bristol High
way and Will Soon Start
Work on West End.
Work on building the proposed 200
mlies of graded roads in this county is
moving alo:;g in good shape and sev
eral miles of good grade are already
completed and work is now in progress
at four points and will be started at
the fifth next week.
DIXIE SHORT ROUTE.
The Dixie Short Route north of Cross
ville is rapidly neanng completion and
not over three weeks with a small
force of men is the time estimated to
complete the work. There is some
surafcing and three steel bridges to be
put in. Most of the steel is here and
the remainaer is on the road,
Commissioner C. G. Black went to
Fentress county last week and he, with
the Fentress county commissioners,
let the contract for the steel bridge
over Clear creek at the county line for
$1,100. This does not include the
abutments and approaches, which will
not be quite so heavy on the Cumber
land as on the Fentress side.
COVE MOUNTAIN
Work was commenced a tew weeks
ago on the road up the mountain from
Grassy Cove in the direction ot Crab
Orchard. There was considerable
heavy rock work and progress has been
slow. The work has advanced so far
now that the remainder of the work on
the mountain side will be done by hand
and the teams are grading on top the
mountain. The progress will be much
more rapid from now on.
EAST END OF M -TO-B. HIGHWAY
The road is couipletfd n the east
end ot the Memphis-to-Bristol High
way through Renfro Holli w and to a
point beyond Ozone. An excellent
road has been made through Renlro
Hollow and the work is moving along
at a gona rate beyond Ozone. It is
now no difficult task to go Irom Cross
ville to Rockwood by car.
WEST END OF M. TO-B.
Plans are being arranged to start
work on the west end of the Meniphis-to-Bristol
Highway Monday, beginn
ing nine miles west of town where the
work stopped a few years ago when the
county spent $40,000 on the road.
From there to Pleasant Hill it is four
miles and most of the way the road Is
very rough. Just how difficult it will
be to build it is not known but a part
cf it at least is expected to be rather
slow work. From Pleasant Hill to the
county line is about three miles. It
is through a practically level country
and can be built rapidly.
The White c unty people have been
doing considerable work on the moun
tain section and have done some grad
ing on top of the mountain. Under
normal conditions the time shoula be
short when autos can go from Cross
ville to Sparta with ease.
TO CLIFTY.
Dr. W. B. Young was recently in
consultation with the commissioners
relative to construction of that section
from the Washburn farm on the M.-to-B.
highway to Clifty, a distance of
about seven miles, lha Commission
ers have been informed that Clifty
people and others in that section of the
county stand ready to give 200 days
work free on that section of road when
work is started. On that account and
the further fact that there is much
travel from that section, the commis
sioners hope to arrange to begin work
at no distant date.
As tbe work proceeds the estimate
of an average cost of $1,000 a mile
seems to be rather more than is likely
to be required. In the event that
should prove true we are likely to get
more than 200 miles of good graded
roads with our $200,000 expenditure.
SENATORIAL CONVENTION.
Clifty and Crossville People Attend and
$160 Raised for the Fair.
Four autos loaded with nearly twenty
Crossville people attended the mats
meeting called at Pleasant Hill Satur
day night in the interest of the Cum
berland Plateau Fair Association.
Dr. W. B. Young and several ot tbe
leading citizens of Cliftv were also
there. Owing to circuit court being in
session, several Pleasant Hill citizens
were not able to attend. In spite of
such obstacles the meeting was a suc
cess and resulted in $160 being sub
scribed. One ot the unique features of
the meeting was that the first sub
scription was received from a woman.
Mrs. F. J. Upham, Crossville, gave
her name tor ten dollars.
A committee of five was appointed
to solicit subscriptions. The commit
tee is: D. W. Lundy, chairman, Her
bert Smith, J. C. Anderson, W. E.
Wheeler, S. V. Suttles. These gen
tlemen will doubtless be able to secure
numerous subscriptions in that section.
