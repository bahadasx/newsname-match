Most Remarkable and Almost Unexpected Demonstration When
Mr. Hughes Says, "If Wages Can Be Increased by
Law They Can Also Be Decreased by Law."
ADAMSOM BILL WILL DO GREAT INJURY TO WORKING MEN
Mrs. Hughes, Wife of the Next President of ttte United States,
Shows Herself to Be a Great Campaigner and is
Given a Rousing Welcome and Reception.
A most remarkable and almost unexpected demonstration
took place here this morning when Charles E. Hughes, Republican
presidential nominee, in addressing perhaps the largest political
gathering in the history of Clarksburg, denounced the Adamson
eight-hour railroad bill, remarkable in view of the fact that this
is one of the most important industrial communities in West Vir
ginia. The great crowd, estimated conservatively at 10,000 peo
ple, went off its feet in uproars of applause when Mr. Hughes de
nounced the Adamson measure as "government by hold-up", and
an equally big demonstration followed his remark that "wages
can be decreased by law if they can be increased by law."
Although Mr. Hughes devoted the major portion of his speech
to the protective tariff principle and was applauded to the echo,
his denunciation of the Adamson law appeared to have a more im
pressive effect upon the mammoth gathering than his remarks on
the tariff, or on foreign relations. Tremendous cheering punctuat
ed the candidate's remarks on the maintenance and protection of
the rights of American citizenship, with which he concluded his
spaech.
Crowd for Protective Tariff. ?
It was a protective tariff crowd
that greeted Mr. Hughes at the
Clarksburg station and the candidate
was well aware of the fact. There
was no mistaking this when he de
clared that "you have got to have
honestly and faithfully applied, the
doctrine of protection to American
industry if you are going to be suc
cessful." This remark came at the
close of a brief review of the work
ing of the Underwood tariff in the
months before the European war up
set normal conditions, and it. caused
a big demonstration.
Baltimore street for a square east
and west, of the speakers' platform
and Fifth street farther down than
Mr. Hughes's words could carry were
packed and jammed with an enthusi
astic and Interested crowd of people.
Flags and bunting were everywhere
in evidence and patriotic music stir
red everybody to a high pitch. The
First Regiment band of the West
Virginia National Guard, a Fairmont
band, Hack Crummitt's drum corps
and the local colored drum corps fur
nishing the music.
Crowd Delays Train.
The speaking was delayed perhaps
twenty minutes because the Short
IJne special carrying a huge crowd
of people from Pine Grove and inter
mediate points was late. The special
train from West Union had previous
ly arrived with another big crowd.
Fairmont, Morgantown, Manning
ton and other points in that sec
tion sent a large delegation in six
interurban trolley cars from Fair
mont. Hundreds also came here on
trolley cars from Weston and points
between. There was a bigger crowd
at the station than greeted Mr.
Hughes or Mr. Taft when they spoke
briefly here in 1908.
Bands were playing when Mr.
Hughes, escorted by Virgil L. High
land, of this city, Republican nation
al committeeman for West Virginia;
Judge Ira E. Robinson, of Grafton.
Bepublicannomineefor governor, and
other prominent party leaders, left
Ills special train and walked between
lines of policemen to the platform
just off the railroad station. The
moment he appeared in view pan
demonium broke loose and the band
music was drowned in the tumult'.
The cheering lasted for several min
utes, it being an ovation notable for
its sincerity.
Introduced by Highland.
Mr. Highland introduced Mr.
Hughes and the nominee 'proceeded
with the speech clowly and in a
rather low tone, explaining as he did!
bo that his voice had been pretty
badly used and that he was forced to
eave it. Mr. Hughes had delivered
a long speech the night before at the
largest political gathering ever as
sembled at Baltimore.
Following Mr. Hughes's speech,
Judge Ira E. Robinson, in response to
calls from the crowd, made a few re
marks, touching upon the Importance
of the impending election and the
reasons why West Virginia should
support the entire Republican ticket
both national and state.
Ovation for Mrs. Hughes.
Mrs. Hughes was accorded a won
derful reception from both men and
women, of whom there were many
in the large assemblage, and also
from the thousands of school children
who had been let out of school for
the momentous occasion. Cheer upon
Chepr greeted her when she first ap
peared and was received by a com
mittee of prominent Clarksburg
women. Upon being escorted to the
speakers* platform, another wave of
applause greeted her. At the close
of the speaking, when she was escort

Next Congressman Addresses
Audience of Ritchie
County Voters.
HARRISVILLE, Oct. 11.?The big
gest Republican rally of this cam
campaign or of any campaign In many
years was held here yesterday after
noon. The tabernacle here, which
has a capacity of about fifteen hun
dred, was crowded. There were vot
ors from all parts of the county pres

they heard two of the bcBt speakers

three hours they held the attention
'of the audionce and both orators ca
pable of eloquent flights, they brough:
the audlcnco to ltB feet time and again,
cheering. Judge Oscar Hundley, ot
Alabama, and the Hon. Stuart F. Reed,
Republican candidate for Congress in
this, the Third district, were .the
speakers.
After the meeting they were given
a One reception, shaking hands with
hundreds of peop?e who showered
them with congratulations over the
Qne speeches they had dollvved. The
meeting was !n vivid contract with the
one addressed by John J. Cornwell,
Democrats. candidate for governor,
here on Monday afternoon. His au
dience was small, and spiritless, most
of those present being Republicans
and Buffragist workers, who turned
out of curiosity to hear what the Wat
son candidate had to say.
Last night at Cairo Messrs. Hundley
and Reed again addressed a big and
enthusiastic meeting, which filled the
opera houso to overflowing. Loaders at
Cairo declared it the best meeting that
has been held In that town In many
years. After these two meetings par
ty leaders prodlct that Ritchie coun
ty, which is a banner Republican

ity for Hughes. Robinson and the en
tire Republican ticket The party is
united in Ritchie county, they say.
The government maintains 27,340
miles of road in Spain and has more
than 3,000 miles under construction
at the present time.
Charles E. Hughes.
HIGH LIGHTS OF
HUGHES'S TALK
I think that the principles forwhlch we stand arc Just as neces
sary lor the prosperity of Democrats as for the prosperity of Repub
licans.
We desire to promote enterprise. We propose to protect Amer
ican rights. We propose to safeguard American peace. We propose
to maintain the national honor.
I want straight American common sense applied to the upbuild
ing of American industry.
It is no ubb to talk about hours of labor or conditions of labor
or wages, if you cannot get any work at all.
The foundation of social Justice Is abundance of employment,
is prosperity.
I am desirous of having wages paid that arc Just and right and
according to the facts.
You Indict a whole nation if you say you cannot get things done
that are fair.
I stand for American rights throughout the world without fear
or favor.
I desire to see our peace maintained.
There 1b only one way In this country to have permanent peacc,
and that Is to stand firmly for your Just and known rights.
I want to see economical government. I want to see a tendency
at least, to a business-like administration of government, an effi
cient government. ?

Many Change Their Minds
When They Learn Truth
about the Measure.
An Important ofllcln! of the Brother

way systems of tho stalo, has writ
ten a private letter lo ? man Identi
fied with political work here regard
ing a change with respect to the eight
hour legislation. The writer says ho
has "talked with many tralnmon re?
'cently, and he declares that the fool

count of the lnw Is changing.
Straight I'arty Vote.
"The men," he writes, "aro very
anxious to know Just what wo did
get when we got the eight-hour law,
and because they do not know they
are viewing the hasty legislation with
suspicion. I talked with several men
who had said Just after the eight-hour
law passed they were going to sup
port Wilson for president, who have
changcd their minds. There will be
a few who were with the Bull Moose
party four years ago who will voto
for Wilson, but I think by election
time you can flguro on a straight par
ty vote.
"As the mileage haBls of pay Is what
all work outside of yard work Is fig

an hour basis only would mean a
reduction In pay for all trainmen not
In yard service.
"The law does not state the rats of
pay; that Is, the rate per hour, and
If we are to use the rate now In our

If In effect as to tho rate of pay. why
not In effect as to the mileage basis

"If the present contraots are to re

changed that reads "ten miles per

and that changed to eight Instead of

Wilson should have used his Influence
