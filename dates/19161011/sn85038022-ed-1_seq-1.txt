The success of a auh-dlvlslon de
pends on the character of the home
owners, the health fulness of the loca
tion and the supplying of every mod
ern convenience. Owing to the topo
graphy of Maysville, the public service
corporatlona have never extended
their lines beyond the city llmlta.
When the new snb-dlvlslon was plan
ned, it was necessary for the promo
tors to provide these conveniences at
their own expense. It wus announced
at the opening of the property, and
jthat promise ha heen carried out, that
upon the completion of the water, gas
and electric systems, those properties
would not be retained by the promo
tors, but would be turned over to trus
I toes, fully paid for, for the use and
I benefit of those who might desire to
dwell on Edgemont.
No expense has been spared to make
I these conveniences perfect. The Mnys
( vllle Gaa Co. installed the gas line
and delivers Kas to tho Edgeimun main
at the same rate now charged, or
which may hereafter be charged Mays
ville consumers, rendering tbe mriniii
ly account to each consumer in r
a DM manner and on tho same terms
aa are given down town users.
Water is taken for the whole ai
Fdgeiuont from the mains us the
leave the city reservoir, under the
miter system, be given to the con
Miiiiers of similar quantities of water.
It la dumped through the Edgemoti'
yatM by an automatic, eleeliicallv
driven pump and supplied to the Edge
mont consumers. Any profit, if made,
will be used by the trustees in the Im
provement of the grounds.

"The Home of QUALITY Clothes"
Yews of interest to Sveryone
Nowaday, we read a great ileal in the papers about the hifrli cost of woolena, the scarcity of
dye-atuffa, and the rise la labor- which is all true, and moat nceeaaarily affeel the price of
clothes.
But we were one of the few houses in the Ohio Valley who were fortunate enough to have
made the hulk of our fall purchase during the early part of 1916, which enables us to sell you
goods at the same old price as you paid last year. Many houses are obliged to raise their
prices, but we are not, and are going to give you the benefit of our early purchase.
All l our new Suits. Overcoats, Slides. Hats and Furnishings arc now in- all dependable
mtrehandiae, up to our high standard of quality and the prices are no higher than last year.
COME IN AND LOOK AROUND.

Suits That Look Double Their Price
A little discovery that all the essential "smartness" of tailoring depends upon
the line brings suits of rare attractiveness at very moderate prices. It is astonish
ing to find suits so smart as these in this low range of price. It is only because
domestic talent copies so well the essentials of imported models that it can be done.
