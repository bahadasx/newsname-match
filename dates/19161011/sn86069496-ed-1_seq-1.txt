COMMITS SUICIDE.
Wesjey Dowell, Son of T. B. Dow
ell, Uses a Shot Gun to End
His Existence.
TRAGEDY OCCURRED AT GRADYYILLE.
Last Wednesday forenoon, between
the hours of eleven and twelve o'clock,
the news spread over Gradyvllle that
Wesley Dowel!, soq of Mr. T. B. Dow
ell, Who was about twenty-three years
old, had shot and killed himself at his
father's home.
The particulars, as we gather them,
are about as follows:
Wesley was sitting iu the family
room talking to one of his sisters.
Suddenly he got up, handed her his
watch, saying: "Keep this in remem
berance of me." He then walked up
stairs to his roora where he had a
shot gun. Placing the muzzle to his
right breast, he discharged it, either
with his foot or a stick. He lived
about twenty jnlnutes.
Dr. C. M. Russell, Coroner, held an
inquest and the verdict of the jury
was in accordance with the above.
We learn that lie was an industrious
young man, but for some time lie had
been paying his respects to a young
lady and his visits to her were not ap
proved by his family, and that he had
been admonished by his father and
step mother to quit keeping her com
pany. The deceased was the only child by
T. B. DowelFs first wife.

SKETCHES.
Horace K. Alexander.
It is not often you meet a gentle
man in this part of Kentucky who is
not acquainted with Horace King Al
exander. TJutil recent years he was a
stock dealer, traveling all over this
section of the State and a portion of
Tennessee. One of his chief charac
teristics is his Chesterfield manners,
a more "graceful" and elegant man is
rarely seen He is a friend to every
body and every body is his friend. He
was born and reared in Burkesville,
and from a boy to the present day, he
has been a favorite with his home peo
pie. His lienage is as good as Kentucky
blood makes, yet lie has at all times
had the utmost respect for those in
the humble walks of life. His hat is
off to every woman he meets, be she
poor or living in affluence. Visit
Burkesville and if he is at home he
will take a delight in making yon ac
quainted with the entire populace,
and if courteous treatment will make
you feel at home, the hours will pass
pleasantly while under his care.
For several years he has been on the
road, traveling for the Louisville
Grocery Company and his trade has
increased from the start. He presents
his price list and if you give him an
order vou will know from Ins manner
that your trade is appreciated. The
longer he remains upon the road the
erreater volume of business will come
his way. The house he represents is I
one of the best in Louisville, and it
made no mistake when it secured the
services of Mr. Alexander. Living
comfortable with his wife and two
children in his home town, he is happy
in his efforts to lighten their burdens,
and on his return trips he is given a
happy greeting by his loving compan
ion and devoted offsprings.
May his last days be the happiest,
is the wish of the writer who has
known him from boyhood to the pres
ent. Good Farm Tor Sale.
The Last Mexican Soldier in Adair
County Dies.
Mr. J. W..Campbell, who was eighty
six years old, a soldier in Capt. Jack
Squires' Company in the Mexican war,
died atrhisjate home, on Harrodsfork,
last Wednesday. He was a highly re
spected old gentleman, and his funeral
was largely attended.
Death of an Old Lady.
Last Tuesday afternoon, between 4
and 5 o'clock, Mrs. Mary 0. Noe, who
was the mother of Mr. W. E. "Noe,
who owns the auto line between this
place and Campbellsvilie, died at her
son's residence in this -city. The de
ceased was seventy-four years old last
May, and had been a member of the
Methodist Church for many years.
The deceased was reared in Green
and Hart counties, but before coming
to Columbia she resided at Bradfords-
ville, Marion county, where she had
lived for a long time, and where her
husband, who died about one year ago,
was buried.
She was a very estimable lady and
had made many friends during her
short stay in this place.
Wednesday morning the remains
were conveyed to Bradfordsville
where they were interred late in the
afternoon by the side of her husband.
Mr. W. E. Noe is her only child, but
she leaves a number of step children.
May God comfort them in this hour
of sorrow. '
Work of Fiscal Court
Farm for Sale.
The October term of the Fiscal
Court came to a close last Friday after
noon, it being in session four days.
Besides transacting the usual rotine of
business that confronts the court every
October, the Campbellsvilie pike was
presented, and after 'the Magis
trates viewed the road to the Taylcr
county line, they decided that the
county was almost compelled to assist
in its Improvement and readily ap
propriated $2,500 00 to come out of the
1917 road fund. This, with the tolls,
is believed sufficient to put the road
in good condition.
The Court also applied for State Aid
for 1917 and will expect to receive
from three to five thousand dollars, to
be used in building new roads. The
Judge was authorized to issue County
Warrants to secure the money for the
Campbellsvilie pike so that the road
can be put in condition before the win
ter sets in. This appropriation, with
the toll money on hand, will do con
siderable work. Dr. HarlanSimpson
was elected physician and Janes
keeper of the Poor House
Dr. S. P. Miller was elected Jail
physician
Card of Thanks.
We feel that we owe a great debt of
gratitude to our friends and neighbors
