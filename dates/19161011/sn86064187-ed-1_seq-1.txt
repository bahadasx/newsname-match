Union Station Recommenda
tion Unsatisfactory.
That Mayor Overholser and the city
commissioners acted with haste and
without due consideration of tne sub

station, was intimated this morning by
Jack l)ve, chairman of the corporation
commission, following a conference with
a number of business men.
Committee to lnveitigate.
The result of the conference was
the appointment of Joseph Huckins jr.,
to select a committee of five of which
he is chairman, to go over the plans
and make whatever recommendations
to the commission the committee lees
fit. Upon the report of this commit
tee and not that of the city commis
sioners will the commission act, it was
atated. i .... . . .
"The commission felt that the busi
ness men of the town should pass upon
the plans and specifications for the
union station since action was taken
so quickly by the city commissioners
that the commission does not feel that
the business men of the city were duly
consulted about the Jans," said Chair
man Love.
Plans Discussed.
"In view of that we called a con
ference of business men who met in the
office of the commission thii morning
and went over the plant. It was dead
ed that Mr. Huckins should select five)
men to constitute a committee repre
sentine the business interests, and that
the committee ihall give the plans the
, consideration they warrant, and upon
the recommendations of this committee
the commission will act
Bearing the approval of Mayor Over
holser and the city commissioners, the
plant were returned to the commit
tion Tuesday afternoon with the sug
gestion from the mayor that the com
mission issue an order directing that
work on the ttation commence by Jan

Thii recommendation, however, it an
satisfactory to the commission as it
does not want to delay work that long.
Commissioner Henshawi atated that the
