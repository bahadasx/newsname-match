Kbbets Field, Brooklyn, Oct. 11.
Manager Carrigan's Boston Red Hose
reversed the tables on the battling
Brooklyn Dodgers again today, taking
the fourth game of the series for the
world's .diamond title and advancing
to within one game of a final triumph.
The score was 6 to 2.
The Dodgers got away at a rip
snorting pace in the first inning and
opened the scoreboard with two runs.
Johnston hit the first ball pitched to
him for three bases and scored on
Myers's drive thru Janvrln. Myers
scored a few seconds later when Jan
vrin fumbled Cutshaw's grounder.
Leonard was not going good and the
Dodgers had the bases full, but two
runs were ll they could accumulate.
The Sox appeared to be merely
aroused by the sting of their oppon
ents' spurt, and In the first of the sec
ond they stepped to the lead when
with Hoblitzel and Lewis on the
paths, Larry Gardner poled a 4-ply
clout to center field, thereby making
himself the hero of the day. Mar
quard appeared to be having trouble
with his control in the second frame.
In the first of the fourth the Sox
added another when Lewis singled.
went to second on a sacrifice and
counted on Carrigan's base blow to
center.
Marquard Relieved.
In the fourth inning Marquard was
sent to the bath house, Pfeffer bat
ting for him and Cheney taking the
mound at the beginning of the fifth
round. Cheney was given a round of
applause when he went to the firing
line, but with his spit ball not working
its best, he walked Hooper and the
latter scored on Hoblitzels double to
1-ft.
The Sox made it 6 to 2 in the first
of the seventh when Janvrin scored on
Cheney's wild throw to first of HobHt-
zel's grounder. Cheney passed out of
the equasion in the last of the seventh
when O'Mara batted for him. Rucker
took up Brooklyn's mound burden in
the first of the eighth.
The games now stand:
Boston has won 3.
Brooklyn has won 1.
Kbbets Field, Brooklyn, Oct. 11.
Spurred on by Tuesday's victory, the
Brooklyn Nationals resumed their
counter charge against the Boston
Americans today in the fourth gume
of the world series in an attempt to
break down the lead that the cham
pion American leaguers now hold by
one game.
"Our boys are batting at last," said
Manager Wilbert Robinson, of the
Brooklyns. this afternoon Just before a
war council with his men. "We are
a batting team. We have looked over
all the Red Sox pitchers except Leon
ard and we know now what to expect.
I'll agree Boston has some fine hurlers,
but my men feel that they can beat
them."
The Bostons regard Tuesday's de
feat as nothing more than what might
be expecjd to happen somewhere
along the course of a seven game
series.
Sox Best In Pinch.
"The Red Sox play best In a pinch,"
remarked Jack Harry. the disabled
peennd baseman of the Boston team
"We have the edge and will hold it.
F.very one knows what the club has
done when it faced a critical series or
a single game."
Brooklyn did not mind the cold
weather today. Elated by Tuesday's
defeat of the Red Sox. the enthusiastic
crowd that came early to the field
would have felt comfortable on an
iceberg.
The Brooklyns took about an hour's
batting practice before the game

Dell, right-handers and the south
paw. Mails. Pitchers Cheney, Pfeffer

MANY VEXING PROBLEMS UP
Parliament to Discuss Con
scription in Ireland.
Consider Extending Military
Age to 45 Tears.
London, Oct. 11. Premier Asquith
received a tremendous ovation in the
house of commons this afternoon when
he declared in the midst of a speech
in which he moved new war credits:
"This war cannot end in a patched up
precarious, dishonoring compromise,
masquerading under the name of
peace."
The premier's declarations on the
subject of peace came toward the con
clusion of an address in which he ask
ed new credits of $1,600,000,000 from
commons, bringing the total for the
war up to approximately $15,660,000,
000. He followed this request with a
brief statement of the military situ
ation, pointing out that in the recent
operations on the Somme front. Gen.
Haig's men have advanced their lines
seven miles on a nine mile front and
hold all the conquered positions. His
emphatic statement regarding peace,
lending ' new emphasis to Lloyd
George's recent statement on peace,
was construed by his hearers as Brit
ain's final answer to the recent peace
rumors emanating from the United
States and from Germany. The house
of commons welcomed it with a great
outburst of applause.
London, Oct. 11. The house of
commons today began consideration of
the serious problems resulting from
the war with the introduction by Pre
mier Asquith of a new vote of credit
for 300,000,000 pounds. Under the
procedure of parliament this step per
mits members to discuss any subject.
It was expected the debate would in
clude, in addition to financial ques
tions, the government of Ireland,
which nationalists who have definite
ly taken sides against the government
will bring up; the suggestion of ex
tension of conscription to Ireland,
which unionists are urging but which
it is understood the government op
poses; and the obtaining of more men
from England, Scotland and Wales by
closer scrutiny of men under 40 years
of age, who have been thus far ex
empted from military service. Exten-

'AWFUL TRAGEDY OF INACTION'
America Refused to Do Duty,
Colonel Declares.
"Kept Us Out of War," Phrase
of a Coward.
New Tork, Oct. 11. War is staring
the United States in the face right
across our three-mile limit, and the
nation has no policy, no plan, pur
pose or preparation, according to a
statement issued by Colonel Roosevelt
here in regard to the submarine ac
tivity on the eastern coast. The colo
nel's statement follows:
"When at the outbreak of the war
the German armies stood at the gates
of Belgium a question of momentous
importance to this and coming gen
erations was raised. It was a great
question that concerned all neutral
nations and America, especially Amer
ica, as the leading neutral power.
"It rested with us as a nation to
decide whether or not we favored the
abandonment of duty. President Wil
son avoided taking any stand for the
right. He stated that the war and
its issues were no concern of ours.
He was silent when Belgium suffer
ed terrible wrong.
"President Wilson put America In
the position of refusing to do her
duty to others. In the face of this
aggression, he speedily put America
in a position of refusing to do her
duty to her own citizens. Step by
step international law has been brok
en down.
American Uvea lost.
"By the attacks of German submar
ine! upon merchantmen, the lives of
hundreds of Americans were sacri
ficed in a course which culminated in
the sinking of the Lusitania. In a
similar fashion, the commercial rights
of property upon the sea were invaded
by England and the whole structure
of international law for the protection
of commerce and private property was
broken down.
"Now the war has been carrido
our very shores. There la no Ameri
can who does not realize the -awful
tragedy of our indifference and in
action. "President Wilson's ignoble shirk
ing of responsibility has been clothed
in an utterly misleading phrase, the
phrase of a coward 'he kept us out
of war. In actual reality, war has
been creeping nearer and nearer until
it stares at us from just beyond our
three-mile limit, and we face it with
out policy, plan, purpose or prepara
tion. "When America, as the leading neu

WHAT'S GERMANY'S INTENTION
Lansing Holds Long Confer
ence With President.
Will U. S. Countenance Contin
uance of Ship Sinking.
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 11. Sec
retary of State Lansing left for Wash
ington shortly before 9 o'clock after
a long conferencs with President Wil
son last night on new problems raised
by activities of the German submar
ine U-53 off the American coast.
The impression prevails here that
Germany acted entirely in accordance
with her promises to this government
in her operations on British shipping
off Nantucket Shoals Sunday.
But while methods employed by
the commander of the U-53 appear to
comply with this government's stipu
lations, the larger question concern
ing the administration now is whether
the United States can tolerate further
submarine activities outside her port,
menacing commerce and constantly
exposing to danger the lives of Amer
ican men, women and children. There
is a strong undercurrent of feeling
against any such continued practice
which might be contemplated by Ger
many. Some Urge More Than Protests.
Scores of telegrams have been re
ceived by the president from bus
iness interests demanding that sharp
reminders must be given Germany
that she cannot virtually "blockade
the ports of the United States." Some
advise that the action of this govern
ment should not be limited to mere
protests.
Officials here declined to comment
on what was this government's next
step in the new submarine problem.
Secretary Lansing would make no
statement whatever before leaving for
Washington. After an early break
fast with Lansing, the president left
for a game of golf and nothing regard
ing .his conference with the secretary
of state was forthcoming from the
sunimer White House offices. It is
likely, however, that steps will be
taken at once to get further informa
tion as to Germany's future intentions
if these have not already been taken
and to determine whether Germany
plans to make her campaign against
enemy ships on this side of the At
lantic permanent.
See No More of U-Boat.
New York, Oct. 11. Nothing to in
dicate the presence of German sub
marines off the American coast was
observed by steamships that arrived
in this port today after voyages from
the east and south. There was no un
usual activity on the seas, the arrivals
reported, nor were any entente war

Washburn and Friends Meet in Im

Wichita, Kan., Oct 11. The play
ers of both Friends University and
Washburn college were reported in
excellent condition for their clash at
Leland Park this afternoon in what
was regarded as one of the most im
portant contests of the Kansas confer
ence. It was the first meeting of the
twoteams since 1912.
The game was scheduled to begin
at 3:45 and arrangements were made
for a record breaking crowd, many of
the visitors at the wheat show being
expected to attend. The importance
of the contest came from the fact that
the two teams are regarded as the
strongest in the conference.
Washburn, under the direction of
Dr. Kennedy, has been regarded as a
strong contender of the state title
honor since the beginning of the sea

Commercial Club Calls on All
Loyal Jayhawkers
To Meet the First Regiment on
Its Return.
SPECIAL TRAINS WILL RUN
Thousands Are Expected to Go
in Automobiles.
To Be the Biggest Picnic Eyer
Pulled Off.
When the boys of the First regi
ment, Kansas militia come home, they
won't be lonesome for long. They
will find the great, warm, hearty hand
of Kansas stretched out ready to wel
come them upon their arrival at
Junction 'City on their way to Fort
Kiley preliminary to being mustered
out. Kansas will be thankful to have
her brave lads back safe and sound.
Representatives of various organiza
tions of Topeka business men met this
noon in the Commercial club rooms
for the purpose of planning a fitting
celebration for the men in khaki. It
was first thought that the soldiers
would be routed thru Topeka, but a
telegram from General Funston de
clared this to be too expensive. Then
it was proposed to pay the expenses of
the boys to come to this city from the
fort, but this, too was declared not
feasible. Finally it was unanimously
agreed that the best thing would be to
make the affair a state-wide one, par
ticipated in by every city sending
troops, and by all those interested in
their welfare. A call has been issued
for the multitude to proceed to Junc
tion City next Sunday, armed with
baskets of good things to eat.
Arrangements are being made with
the railroads for special trains to ac
commodate the throngs that are ex
pected to go.
Capper Will Be There.
J. Will Kelley, secretary of the Com
mercial club, is attempting to get
Henry Allen of Wichita, and Charles
F. Scott of Iola, for speeches. It Is
practically certain that Governor Cap
per will be on hand.
The Automobile club is getting busy,
trying to do its part. When the troops
left, approximately 2,000 cars carried
people down to epeed their departure.
It is anticipated that between 5,000
and 10,000 automobiles will greet the
boys on their return.
Notification is being forwarded to
many of the towns of the state for the
purpose of making the movement as
widespread as possible. The following
cities are represented by the First
regiment: Topeka, Lawrence, Horton,
Burlington, Paola, Fredortia, Hia
watha. Fort Scott, Manhattan, Garnett,
Yates Center, Humboldt, Iola (signal
corps), and Junction City.
Persons are cautioned not to forget
their baskets the stores aren't open
on Sunday. The celebration has been
fixed for that day because of the ab
sence of most of the drill duties pres
ent on other days, and because the
troops may be mustered out very
quickly after their arrival.
When the Second regiment comes
back, ten days or so later, it will re
ceive a similar ovation.
Topeka will furnish a special wel
come for the members of battery A
and the Second regiment band.

COLLEGE PREXY
SCORNS POPULAR
USE "HIGHBROW
Princeton, N. J., Oct. 11. Popular
use of the term "highbrow" to ex
press scorn of intellectual things Is
condemned by President John Q. Hib
ben, of Princeton university.
"This term is not used merely to
express contempt for pedantry or In
tellectual Pharisaism," said Dr. Hib
ben in his address to the students at
the opening of the university yester
day. "If this were the case," he added, "1
would not quarrel with those who
might thus use it. The term is gen
erally employed as a weapon of emas
culated minds which are content dully
to range along the dead level of th
trivial and the commonplace."
