German Submarine Comes to
American Waters
Boston, Oct. 8.?A submarine
of the Imperial German Navy,
ravaged shipping off the eastern
coast ot the United States today.
Four British, one Dutch and
one Norwegian steamer were
sent to the bottom or left crippled
derelicts off Nantucket
Shoals. Tonight under the light
of the hunters moon the destroyer
flotilla of the United States
Atlantic fleet was picking up
passengers aqd crews of the de
siroyed vessels and bringing
them into Newport, Rhode Island.
So far as known there was no
loss of life although at a late
hour the crew of the British
steamer Kingston had not been
accounted for. A submarine
held up the American steamer
Kansan, bound from New York
for Genoa'with steel for the Italian
Government, but later on establishing
her identity allowed
the American to proceed. The
Kansan came into Boston harbor
late tonight for her usual
call here.
The submarine is believed to
be the U 53, which paid a call to
Newport yesterday and disap
peared at sunset. Some naval
men, however, declared that at
least two submarines are operating
close to the American shore
though outside the three-mile
limit.

Sampton Barrett, Alf Cuthbertson,
Henrv Alsobrooks,
Duke Alsobrooks, lim Fuller
and Calvin Carelock are a
"seedy" looking bunch this
morning, after going through an
experience that cost them a total
of $23.40. They fell victims to
a swindler of the J. Rufus Wallingford
type, and paid high for
some good practical experience.
It happened in the followingmanner:
A white stranger, evidently
a tramp, passed by the
depot yesterday morning, accosted
Allen Alsobrooks, color:
ed, and told him that he would
i Dass through with a r.artm of
whiskey last night. Allen exhibited
some interest so the
stranger told him to tell his
friends to meet him near the
Frank Helm's place, three miles
from town on the Charlotte
I road, at about eight o'clock, and
! to tell them also to bring some
money and a few jugs.
I Allen lost no time in spreading
the news. It wasn't long
> before he had a bunch of blind
i tigers, whiskey soakers that
would gladden the heart of a
Norfolk distiller. Thev scraped
about all day yesterday and got
up 23.50. Then the hour of the
i appointment grew near. Eni
hanced by the company of many
other envious ones, the party
set out.
| Sure enough they were met
bv the man at the agreed spot.
He maintained an air of secrecy,
' collected the money and the
| jugs. Sampton contributed $3,
. equal to three days hard labor,
to the fund. Alf came across
| with $2.50. Henry fottoWfed
, suit. Duke hit 'em a little higher
with $5.50, while old Jim Ful.
ler, pitched in the magnificent
sum of $8.50. Calvin Carelock
' couldn't stand the pace, but did
' throw in $1.50. 1

down the woods a little ways to <
get the "painkiller." Allen responded
with alarcity, but when <
they got about fifty feet, the <
stranger halted. He told Allen
1 to stand on guard, and if he saw
anybody coming, to warn him
with three shrill whistles. Un
; suspectedly, Allen did as he was ,
1 told. |
Fifteen minutes passed. The

an hour and a half, before the j

uttering dire threats and speak ,
' ing their sentiments in unprintable

i When they arrived in town |
i they summoned Chief Griffin ,

went to the scene, where they s
1 found the sacks and jugs, but no \

overalls, blue shirt with collar ,
, attached, and tan shoes. He
; weighed about 175, and his upper
teeth carry gold fillings.

Mr. Finley may run again fo

hat there will be a full field c
candidates in 1918.
Talk of the senatorial race fo
[918 is also being indulged ii
hese days in several parts of th
ptate and especially in politics
circles. The term of Unite
ptates Senator B. R. Tillmai
vill expire in 1919 and his sue
cessor will be chosen at the pri
naries in the Summer of 1911
Many expect Senator Tillman t
)e a candidate to succeed him
self. Everyone looks for forme
Sov. Cole L. Blease to make th
race for the Senate. Others e>
peeled to enter the lists are Cot
pressman A. F. Lever of th
seventh district, W. P. Polloc
:>f Cheraw, L. D. Jennings c

The Record Bale
Mr. C. T. Blakeney in writin
? 1\/T? T? 1 1 .t
iu uic muiuuc juuium il'db III
following: to say in regard to th
record bale:
"I have noted several refei
jnces to a record bale of cotto
jold by Mr. Bivens of Unio
county, the seed and the cotto
bringing him $145.20. A littl
later I noticed that a Mr. Smit
from Pageland sold the cotto
and seed of one bale for $162.0(
"But vou will have to hand
to Mr. B. W. Sullivan of Jeftei
ferson who sold a bale a fe\
lays ago here, the cotton alon
netting him $149.02. Had h
?old the seed at the market pric
this would have meant $30.(1
more, making a grand total c
M79.02.
"Mr. Sullivan did not sell th
seed however, preferring t
keep them to raise some mor
of the same kind of cotton ne>
season. Yours truly,
C. T. BLAKENEY."
Mr. Blakeney evidently ha
not seen an account of that hi
bale we reported last wee!
which was grown by Mr. C. I
Campbell, the man who died i
[he Hamlet hospital Sunda
norning, and bought by Mc
Cregor & Raley at $202.80 fo
he lint and about $30 000 for th
teed. This is indeed the recor

1 Uncle John Tells About . the I

i Back when I wuz a boy," said ,
1 Uncle John reminiscently, "we '

How a man can pay taxes j

k counts on a bale of cotton to
four acres and ten bushels o'

like this un he generally don't

"Sim stopped me t'other day

Bogan Ingram Dies Victim of 1
Accident
Cheraw, Oct. 4.?Yesterday,
shortly after 1 o'clock, Bogan j
Ingram met with a fatal acci- i
lent. He was one ot B. B. ]
Laney's overseers on his planta- .
lion about five miles north of ,
Cheraw, and was running a .
large self feeding gin at the time. ,
Some waste had gathered in ;
some of the teeth, and he lifted
the gin to pull it out, but unfortunately
did not lift it high ,
enough to put it in safety. He
tripped and fell, getting his hand
caught and his hand and arm
were pulled in and cut into
shreds up to the shoulder. He
was immediately put in an automobile
and rushed to Cheraw
for surgical attention. Though
having nearly bled to death by
the time he got here, he pleaded
so earnestly to be taken to a
nospuni, tnat, to Rive his mind]
rest, after the necessary treatment
had been given to his arm
he was taken towards Florence,
hut he died on the way. Mr.
Ingram had lost his other arm
when a very small boy through
the accidental discharge of a gun
in his own hands. He was about
years old and unmarried. He
leaves his parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Samuel Ingram, who live near
Cheraw, and a number of brothers
and sisters, and a large and
prominent family connection.
The funeral service was held in
the Cheraw Methodist church at
4 o'clock this afternoon.
Do animals possess the sentiment
of affection?" asked the
school teacher of the little girl.
"Yeth, ma'am. Almost always,"
?
"Good," praised the teacher.
"Now," turning to the littile boy,
"tell me what animal has the
greatest natural fondness for
for man?'*
Ti i small bov considered
careidlly, then returned:
"Woman."

scratching its face. The cat also
