Allies Told
International Neva Service:
W'ASIU.N'C.TON. Oct. 11. The
text of the American memorandum
replying to that of the allied gov
ernments reardinu treatment of
belligerent su timarincs in neutral
ports is as follows:
The ko ernment of the Cnited
ttat-s has receued the identical
memoranda of the governments of
France, flreal I'.ritain, Itussia and
Japan in which neutral Kovertiments
Hie xh)rted "to take efheacious
measures tending tr revent bellig
erent suhmarinos, regardless of their
use. to aail themsehes of neutral
waters, roadsteads and harbors."
These governments point out the
facility possessed by such rraft to
avoid supervision or surveillance or
determination of their national char
acter and their power "to do injury
that is inherent in their very na
ture," as well as the "additional
facilities" afforded by having at
their disposal places where they
can rest and replenish their sup
plies Want Submarines Held.
Apparently on these grounds, the
allied governments hold that "sub
marine vessels must be excluded
from the benelit of the rules hero
fore accepted under international
law reuardinx the admission and so-
i joiirn of war and merchant vessels
in neutral waters, roadsteads or har
bors; any submarine of a belliger
ent that o: e enters a neutral har
bor must be held there" and there
fore, the allied governments "warn
neutral powfrs of the rt at danger
to neutral submarines attending the
navigation of waters visited by the
submarines of belligerents."
In reply the pover.irnent of the
I'nited States must express its snr-
ise that there appears to he an
endeavor of the allied powers to de-
terinin" the rule of action govern
ing what they regard as a "novel
situation" in respect to the use of
submarines in time of war and to
enforce acceptance of that rule, at
least in part, by warning neutral
powers of the great danger to their
submarines in waters that may b-j
visited b belligerent submarines.

N'KW YORK, Oct. 11. A pos

lished or is seeking to establish a
submarine base on the Mexican
coast is contained in the ''..'est de
velopments in the "U" bor.t raid on
shipping in American waters.
The last reported position of th"?
U-T:; was l.'.S miles due east of Fire
island, which is considerable dis
tance south of the Nantucket shoals
zone where she was operating on
Sunday
A high British official stated that
Capt. Rose of the U-r3 might head
for the gulf of Mexico and attempt
to resume raiding operations. But
he admitted that the temptation of
sinking ships such as the Adriatic,
th Philadelphian and the Minne
h:iti:i might induce him to linger off
New York.
The Minnehaha will carry 10,000
tons of war materials when she
sails, while other great cargoes of
war supplies will be carried on the
Adriatic and Philadelphian.
The mystery of the Kingston, or
Kingstontian, which was reported
to have been sunk off Nantucket on
Sunday, has not yet been cleared up.
It has not yet been definitely estab
lished whether five or six ships were
sunk by the German raiders.
The Fhiladelphian, Adriatic and
Heligidav were among the liners
scheduled to sail tomorrow. The de
parture of the Minnehaha was prob
lematical, hut it was said that she
