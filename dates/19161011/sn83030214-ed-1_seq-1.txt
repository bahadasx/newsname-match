BABY TOSSES $10,000
JEWELS FROM MOTOR
Policeman Thanked for Recov
ering Precious Bag.
Frank A. Bcrthold. who recently
moved from Ridgewood, N. J.. to a
Riversidc Drive apartment. atarted with
his wife and baby ycr-terday on on au?
tomobile trip. He decided that his
wife's jewels, worth about $10,000.
would be safer in the automobile than
in the Riverside Drive apartment.
When they startcd, the beaded bag
holding the jewelry was tightly clasped
in Mrs. Berthold's hand. As they a*v
proached the steep ascent on River
Road. F.dgewater, about a mile above
the Fort Lee ferry, Mrs. Bcrthold
thought she had better use both hands
to hold the baby.
The baby also glanced at the steep
hill ahead, and without a word to any
body lightened the car bv $10,000 worth
of jewelry and a beaded bar: The loss
was diseovercd near Knglewood Cliffs
At the Edgewater police station Mr.
Bcrthold recovered the bug and its cort
tents. Patrolman Frank Joret found it.
Mr. Bcrthold thanked him.

Only One Ballot Against
Strike Found ? Road
Faces Big Tie-Up.
The Hudson & Manhattan Railroad
Company, the Hudson tube system,
faces a complete tie-up to-day. as the
result of a strike voted last night by
about 275 employes conductors, truards
and motormen. At midnight nearly all
the vote had been eanvassed. and only
one vote against the t-trike had been
found.
It was beHc\-ed that a strike would
be called earlv this mornin- and nrep
crations for another labor battle were
completed last night by the police of
Jersey Citv and of Manhattan Two I
extra patrolmen were sent to each tube
Btatiea in Jersey City. The police of
N%w York were in readiness to send

George H. Sines. vice-president of
the Bretherrood of Railroad Trainmen.
said aa soon as the vote was complete. j
; he would commumcate with VVilbur C.
Fisk. president of the tube system
Inless the lutter asked ft.r time, he ,
added. he would order the men out at ,
once. ,
The strike balloting was begun when

company. It il expected. however, that
they will be drawn into the dispute. ,
The trouble may also spread to tbe

WAR JUST OFF
3-MILE LIMIT,
T.R. DECLARES
U. S. Without Policy
or Preparation to
Meet It.
NO EXCUSE FOR
ENDURING WILSON
Nation Cannot Afford to
Remain "Elocutionary
Ostrich."
"The time for the ostrich elocution?
ary ostrich policy for the United
States has passed," Colonel Theodore
Roosevelt asserted in a statement
issued last nipht. "The war stares at
us from just beyond the three-mile
limit," he declared, "and we face it
without policy, plan, purpose or pre?
paration."
The I'-boat rnids off the coast of Xew
England, the Colonel charged, were the
direct result of President Wilson's sub
missive policy toward the nations at
war in regard to the rights of neutrals.
The tirst mistake, he said, was made
when the President permitted the viola
: tion of Belgian neutrality, and this has
| been added to since by thc Lusitania
! and other ineidents. The boldness of
I the Germans in sending a submarine to
1 waylay shipping on the American coast
wa.s the culmination, he said, of Euro?
pean contempt for the I'nited Statea.
He attribute.s Gcrmany's action to the
fact that President Wilson, after de
claring that the I'nited States would
stand as the champion of the rights of
neutral i, has deserted the neutral na?
tions, left them leaderless and the prey
of the belligercnts.
Great Duty laid on I'nited Statea.
Following is Colonel Rosevelt's state?
ment in full;
"When at the outbreak of the war
the German armies stood at thfl Rates;
of Belffium a question of momentous
importance to this ar.d cominrr genera
tions was raised. It was a great ques?
tion that concerned all neutral nations
and America especially as the leauing
neutral puwer. It rested with us as a
nation to decide whether or not we fa?
vored the abandonment of duty.
"President Wilson avoided taking any
stand-ior the right. He stated that tha
war and its issues were no concern of
ours. He 4vas silent when Belgium suf
fercd terrible wrong.
"The German statesrnen, who di
rectad the armies toward Belgium,
faced two altcrnative- either the
rights of a neutral nation like Belgium
had become a fact supported by the
opinion of the world u fact whlch, if
violated, would bring down upon the
aggrea*or the protcst and weight of
neutral opinion or else neutral rights
ware mereiy an empty fiction. In the
latter case, if the Germans did not use
Belgium as a territory through whieh
to pass in order to attack Frtmce, they
reasoned that their enemies would ua.
Belgium without protect by other neu?
trals as a mobili.tation ground for aa
attack against them.
Wilson I.icensed Invaslon.
"If the United States failed to protest
against this attack by Germany it waa
safe for these (ierman chiel's to assume
that there would be no protest by
America againbt English or French mis
conduct. ?
"With an indifferent neutral world,
the German ehiefs decided that the ad
vantagc 4vould lie with those who
rushed through Belgium first. Presi?
dent WUOOB'a inaction, his failure to
make any protest, proved that th r es
timation of the status of international
law, the keeping ol' whieh depended
mainly upon the vigor and initiative of
America, was correct.
"Preeideat Wilaen declared that the
war and the issues of righ* and wrong
mvolved in its conduct and methods
were of no concern to America, th*
leading neutral. He thereby put Amer
ira in the position of refusing to do her
duty to others. whieh inspired contempt
in others. This invi'ed aggres-ion bt
others.
World IaBsr Broken Ilossn.
"In the face of this aggres-ion he
speed'.iy put America in a position of
refusing to do her duty to her own
citizens. Step by Btep international
law has been broken down. By the at?
tacks of German 'ubmarineg upon mer?
chantmen the lives of hundreds flf
Americans were sacrificed in a course
whieh culnunated in the sinking of the
Luflitania. In ? similar fashion the
commercial rights of property upon the
sea were invade.l by England and thfl
structure of international iaw for the
protection of commerce and private
property waa broken down.
"The invasion o( the rights of men
and wom'n to their lives was far more
aenous than thfl invasion of property
rights, and i' <vas this invasion that
ealled for the :irs* and stronjrest ac?
tion on our part; but lf we had taken
auch action '* would have become our
daty " duty then easily performed
ti- protect our property rights in.stantly

U. S. Submarines Must Not Be Sunk by

Washington, Oct. 10.?Replying io the Allied memorandum
urging neutral* to prevent belligerent tubmarinet froux uting neutral
uatcrt, the i'nited State* tatf*:
In thc opinion of the United States the Allied Powers
have not set forth any circumstanecs whieh would render the ex
isting rules of international law inapplicable to them ^German
submarines)'.
The povernment of the I'nited States reserves its liherty of
action in all respects and will treat sueh vessels as, in its
opinion, beeomes the action of a power whieh may bc said to
have taken the first steps toward establishing the principles .
of neutrality and whieh for over a rentury has maintained
those principles in thc traditional spirit and with the high sensc
of impartiality in whieh they were coneeived. /
In order, however, that there should be no misunderstand
ing as to thc attitudc of thc United States, the government of
the I'nited States announces to the Allied Powers that it holds
it to be the duty of belligerent powers to distinguish bctwten
mbmarines of neutral and belligerent nationality, and'tiiat
responsibility of any conflict whieh may arise between
belligerent warships and neutral submarines, on account of the
negleet of a belligerent to so distinguish between these classes
of submarines, must rest entirely upon the negligcnt power.

GERARD DENIES

Evades Questions as
to New U-Boat
Danger.
James W. Gerard, United States Am?
bassador to Germany, who arrived yes?
terday on the Frederick VIII, declared
he did riot expect to see President Wil?
son until afttr the President's return
from Indianapolis. The President
itatt* West to-day, and the "dire warn
ings" of renewed submarine activity
and the "pee.ee proposals," both of
whieh, rumor has said, Mr. Gerard
brings, appanntly flrill keep until his
return on Friday or Saturday.
Mr. Gerard, while willing to diseuas
Ameriean alTairs and partieular'.y eagr
for news of the world's series, refused
to comment on any phase of the Euro?
pean war or on the purpose of his visit
to America at a time when the demands
on his embassy are so great.
He made elear, however, that he
brought no peace proposals from th*
German Emperor and that his visit had
nothing to do with the possibilitiea of
peace.
N'o Statement on I'-Boats.
Mr. Gerard also declared he had
made no statement. either in Berlin or
on board ship, whieh might be con
strued as indicating that his purpose
in coming was to inform President Wil?
son of fjrowing sentiment in Germany
for the abandonment of the Kaiser'fl
pledge to the United States and the
inaururation of a new campaign of
ruthless submarine warfare.
"I have jriven no interview," said Mr.
Geiar.l, "ar.d I cannot give any inter
views while l am here. I cannot dis
euaa any subject rclated to the war."
Mr. Gerard's arrival aroused consid?
erable apaeuletiea Ib circies close tai

grew that Germany's submarine activi- j

Washington, Oct. 10.?Final decision
on rhe policy of the United States
toward the U-boat rnid off the N'ew
Kngland coast han narrowed down, in
the view of officials here, to a consid?
eration of whether proper provision
was made for the safety of the person*
taken from the attacked vessels and
left at sea in small boats.
"Lives unquestionably were imper
illed" by the action of the German aub?
marine U-.73 in placing its victims in
lifeboats. it was declared to-day on the
highest Administration authority. But
for the work of the Ameriean destroy?
ers the passengers. and crews might not
have reached shore "unless picked up

This judgment waa based on offieial
Navy Department reporta of the reacue
work of the destroyers. Aa the Navy
Department haa been charged with the
collection of the evidence on which
Fresident Wilson will base hia action lt
is believed to have peculiar force.
If the evidence is thus strictly insj
terpreted it might be conaidered proof
that Germany had violated her pledgea.
This is conceded by officials, but many
doubt that the President would act un

[Frem a Btaff I7nrrf.pnn.lant of Tia Trlnuna.)
Long Braneh, Oct. 10.?President
Wilson IBBBt thc lato afternoon and
practically all of this evening in a
conference with .Secretary Lansing in
v hich every phase of the latest sub?
marine prohlem was discussed. Ixmg
after the customary hour for retir
ing at Shadow Lawn lights showed
from thc shaded windows, and thfl
telephone wires were kept hot with
communications to and from Wash?
inpton ur.til a late hour.
Those close to the President say
that in all probability a new note
bearing on the submarine situation
will be dispatched to Germany as a
result of to-night's conference.
Thi. doeument, an tentativedy out
lined, is not expected to charge that
i.iterr.ational law wai violated by the
submarine commander in Sunday'a
raids off Nantucket, but to give
svarninir that a repetition of such at?
tacks will endanger the friendly rela?
tions of the two countries. This at
f.tude is based upon the theory tha|
asaults upon commerce on this side
of the Atlantic cannot continue with
cut jcopardizing the lives of Ameri?
can citizens.
Like Protest to Alliea.
In this connection it is pointed out
that the State Department simply
would bc following the course mapped
out when the Allies staticned a pa?
trol of armed vessels a short distance
beyond the United StateB territory
waters early in the war.
A note then was dispatched ta
Great Britain in whieh that govern
it.ent was cautioned that the utmoat
care would Le nece.?sary to prevent
i:)cidents that might endanger tha
friendly relations of the two nations.
As a result of this note the patrol
boats withdrew to the more open
v.aters of tho ocean except, as ex
plained by commanders of such
boats, when driven in by rough saaa.
Secretary l.ansing, who irrived her.
this afcernoon from New York, brought
with him much new information on th.
submarine situation from the German
point of view, gleaned in his inter?
view there with Ambassador Gerard.
He alto carried newapaper clippings
and other documentary evidence tend
ing to prove that the German people
aro insisting that the unhampered uso
of submarines, such aa was denounced
in the President's earlier notes, be re
gjmed in spite of promise-, that inter?
national law would ba observed in th.
conduct of underwater v. .rfare.
The Secretary of State waa accora
par.ied by Mrs. Wilson, who had been
ihoBBlBf, in New York, and made ua.
of this excuse to escapo interviewers.
As a con.-.ei.uer.ce, he gave no hint of
his own attitude in the present aitua
tiaB and, once he had diiappeared
behind the doors of tho Bummer cap?
ital he was inaccersible.
Some hiat of the importance th.
Pr-bidT.t itttaches to the conference
