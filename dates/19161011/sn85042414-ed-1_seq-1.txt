Berlin, Oct. 11.—The budget comi
mittee, after a long discussion today,
rejected the motions of the National
Liberals and Progressives for the ap
pointment of a committee of' the
Reichstag wjth the right to sit during
recesses, but adopted a clerclcal sub
stitute giving the budget committee
that right. This action results In no
practical change, as the budget com
mittee already possessed that right,
but a significant fact is that the cleri
cal motion Includes the right of the
committee to discuss the war.
"80 PER or
NOW DEMAND
8* PAY
Chicago, Oct. 11.—Robert T.
Frazler, Jr. of Nashville, Tenn., chair
man of the "employes 80 per cent
movement," began mailing his report
yesterday to the eighty per cent of
railroad employes not included in the
provisions of the Adamson eight-hour
law.
Mr- Frazier and P. W. Walden went
to Washington when the brotherhood
heads and railway presidents met
there and attempted to have the un
organized employes included in the
provisions of any law that might be
passed. The report, details failure to
obtain a hearing before the president
at that time, or since.
The eighty per cent movement, Mr.
Frazier explained, in making his re
port public, is designed to attain Jus
tice for men outside the brotherhoods.
"We are now preparing petitions
asking congress to investigate the en
tire subject of railway hours and com
pensation," said Mr. Frazier. "The
Adamson law simply raised the wages
of the highest paid class of railway
employes. We,'the eighty per cent
outside the brotherhood certainly are
opposed to any advances to these men
if they mitigate against advances to
the lower paid employes. In a word.
If there is to be legislation on the
subject of compensation we want it
to cover the whole field fairly and
equitably."
Declares the War Nations
Ignore Rights of the Neu
trals Because We Failed to
Keep Faith as their Cham
pions.
New York, Oct. 11—The "Day of
Ostrich"—elocutionary ostrich—poli
cy of the United States has passed,"
Colonel Roosevelt asserted In a state
ment published today.
The U-boat raids off the coast of
New England, Roosevelt charged,
were the direct result of Wilson's sub
missive policy toward nations at war
In regard to the rights of neutrals.
The boldness of the Germans in
sending a submarine to waylay ship
ping on American coast, was the cul-
1 natlon,_he ^^T the European
contempt for the United States.
Roosevelt blamed the latest crisis
to the fact that President Wilson, aft
er declaring the United States would
stand'as the champion of the rights
of neutrals, has deserted the neutral
nations and left them leaderless and
the prey of the belligerents.
"Now that the war has been carried
to our very shores there is no Ameri
can who does not realize the awful
tragedy of our Indifference and. Inac
tion.
Xow War Stares at Us.
"Nine-tenths of wisdom is in being
wise in time. By taking the right step
at the right time America's Influence
and leadership might have been made
a stabiizlng force.
"President Wilson's Ignoble shirk
ing of responsibility has been clothed
In an utterly misleading phrase—the
phrase- of the coward—he kept, us out
of war? In actual reality, war has
been creeping nearer and nearer until
it stares at us from just beyond our
three mile limit and we face it with
out policy, plan, purpose or prepara
tion."

DUTCH PRESS IS ANGRY
Demands Vigorous Protest to Ger
many for "Illegal Act" of
Submarine.
Amsterdam. Oct. ll.—(Via Lon
don,).—The Dutch press is highly in
dignant at the sinking of the Holland
America line steamer Bloomersdijk,
which, it is declared, was absolutely
illegal and contrary to maritime law.
"We ask with astonishment." says
the Nieuws Van Den Dag, "what rea
son the submarine commander could
have for torpedoing a neutral vessel
with a neutral cargo for the neutral
population-of Holland. There was no
possibility of a mistake, for the com
mander of the submarine must have
been aware of the character of the
vessel and for that illegal act Ger-
be
™de
to
The Handelsblad demands that the
government send a strong protest to
the German government.
The Telegraaf regards the raid as
"a sop to the Von Tirpitrites and
thinks that probably the Germans are
allowing their submarines to operate
along the fringe of American terri
torial waters to test the extent of
Ar"Arican natience.
The Holland-America line of Rot
terdam has received onlv a brief re
port of the sinking of the Bloomers
dijk and the rescue of her crew bv the
American destroyer torpedo boat Ben
ham. This report, which does not
give the submarine's number, says
the submarine commander "informed
the Bloomersdijk captain that he
would sink any shin bound by way
of an Enrlish port."
The value-of the Bloomersdijk was
about $1,000,000. half of which was
insured against war risks. The grain
cargo for the Holland government,
however, was not so insured, as the
government carries its own war risks.
New Tork. Oct. n.—officers and
sailors of the Bloomersdijk will re
main until a Dutch steamer sails to
take them home. The men said they
were given 10 minutes to get off their
ship which sank a few minutes after
German sailors had boarded it and
when .the crew was making away In
life boats.

Regardless of anything else that
may be said of the recent action of

not be denied that the farmer has
been given the best of it.- In Adams
county, for instance, the assessed val

straight 2fi per cent basis at $4.31 per
acre. The average value was left by

HE SAW TWOMORE SUBS

Up Again Like a Cork. He
Says.
New Tork. Oct. 11.—Captain Grot
ness of the Christian Knudsen, the
Scandinavian steamer sunk by the
U-53, in his report said he was over
hauled by the submarine U-53 and
two warning shots fired across the
bows. The boat then drew along
side and Captain Grotness was in
structed to come aboard and bring
his papers.
It was while standing on the deck
of the U-53 that he saw, according
to his report, the conning towers of
the two other submarines about four
miles distant. The conning towers, he
said, were the Bame type as the con
ning towers of the boat he was on.
The submarines he saw were moving
in a northeasterly direction.
The crew were allowed about half
an hour to -take to their boats before
the submarine opened fire on the «hip
with her deck guns. About 150 shuts
were fired, most of which hit, but ow
ing to. her divided tank construction
the ship did not sink. Finallv the
boat discharged a torpedo into her
and she blew up.
Captain Grotness spoke of th® short
time .required for the U-63 to sub
merge. He reported that while she
was shelling the ship a.-torpedo boat
destroyer Came in sight. The subma
rine commander evidently thought i:
might be an enemy war vessel, for
he immediately submerged, 'sinking
out of sight )n thirty seconds. As
soon as the destroyer came close

recognized he came up again, popping

once in a while."
The jewelry the prisoners attempted

SUBMARINES DO NOT

Belligerents Must be Re

to Neutral Subs.
Washington, Oct: 11.—Allied war
ships now patrolling the Atlantic
coast searching for the German sub
marine U-53, which raided enemy
merchant shipping off Nantucket Sun
day, would be required to ascertain
the nationality of any submarine
sighted before attacking it. in the be
lief that it was an enemy craft, ac
cording to terms of the latest United
States memorandum to the Allied na
tions published today. The memor
andum is a reply to the allies' protest
against the United States granting the
right of entry to American ports to
either a merchant or war submarine
of belligerent nations.
The text of the American memoran
dum replying, is as follows:
The government of the United
States has received the identical mem
orandum of the governments of
France. Great Britain, Russia and
Japan in which neutral governments
are exhorted "to take efficacious
measures tending to prevent belliger
ent submarines, regardless of their
use, to avail themselves of neutral
waters, roadsteads and harbors."
These governments point out the fa
cility possessed by such craft to avoid
supervision or surveillance or deter
mination of their national character
and their power "to do Injury that is
inherent in their very nature," as well
as the "additional facilities" afforded
by having at their disposal places
where they can rest and replenish
their supplies.
Apparently on these grounds the al
lied governments hold that "sub
marine vessels must be excluded from
