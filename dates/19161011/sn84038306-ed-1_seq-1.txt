ally than Eli C. Perkins.
trusty man and true toevery relation
of life. His word was unhesitatingly
accepted by courts and lawyers. He
wanted to do well his part, and it is
believed that the extra work which
that desire prompted him to do short
ened his life. As a member of the
legislature he drew too heavily upon
his energies while endeavoring to
solve the problems of legislation in a
manner most beneficial to the peo
ple of the state.
Mr. Perkins' chief desire was to be
useful to his fellowmen. In him
there was no trace of enmity or preju

STATE CONTENTION -OF W. C. T. U.
The evening of the 3d of October,
1916, marks an epoch in the beginning
of the State Convention of our W. C.
T. U. held "at Fort Dodge, Iowa, which
those in attendance will not soon for
get.
The hostess, who was our W. C. T.
U. of Fort Dodge, and the host, the
Commercial Club of Fort Dodge, very
graciously entertained the delegates.
We were met at the depot b/ au
tos, decorated with W. C. T. U. ban
ners, conveyed to the M. E. church,
where homes for a few days were as
tgned to the delegates.
V.Tfcje church was beautifully decor
ated with a large flag in center front
beneath an archway of electric lights
and hanging above two other large
flags which were prettily draped along
the railing abort til* president's seat.
The following program was Tender
er with a spirit of enthusiasm, our
state president, Mrs. Ida B. Wise
presiding.
Song—Oe Brewer's Big fosses—Au
dience.
Scripture readlq|r and pyayer.
Then our President Introduced the
different ones who gave addresses of
"Welcome to Fort Dodge." .Each num.-.
ber of the program wa» well ap
plauded. The chorus cbpir -of the U.
E .church, about 50 Voices strong, sang
the anthem "Send Thou Thine Arm."
Mrs. Smith told us a story about
a man who would like to be a woman
for just about one-half a minute, so
he could say he was a member of the*
W I
The Fort Dodge Daily C^fonlcle
says: "Our convention is to be one
of practical things rather than theor
ies," declared Mrs. Smith. "What will
be heard here this week will be by
practical workers instead of theorists.
We have a man who has lived in a
state Avhere tftere is prohibition and
suffrage have gone hand in hand, so
you see that those who attend our
convention will hear first hand in
formation. We did. "We are going
to have a fine convention here and I
know much will result from It." We
did and It will.
Mr. M. F. Healy, representative of
the Commercial Club was happy to
say they did not possess a member
who favored the liquor traffic. And
never again in Fort Dotge will lit
tle children pass an open saloon on
their way to school."
But the saloons, as Supt. Mlnkel
stated, were not dead In Iowa. "Not
dead. but spachless." You know the
story of Mike and Pat.
Carrie Nwtion. that great woman
who seemed destined to be a smash
er of saloons, is now spoken and
thought of with great respect when we
stop to question why she smashed sa
loons.
I wish that time and space permit
tde me to give you a further report of
the delegates.
Delaware County has two enter
prises to think about. Will you think?
Jennie A. Youngreen,
Pres. Del. Co. W. C. T. U.
Confirms Large Class.
Ryan Reporter: Archbishop J. J.
Keane of Dubuque was here last Tues
day morning and administered the sac
rament of Confirmation to a class of
sixty young people. The class pre
sented an imposing sight as .they
marched from the school to the church
and after they were seated, Rev. T. J.
McElliott, of New Hampton celebrate'd
high mass, those in the Banctuary, be
sides His Grace, the Archbiship, be

Manchester Rev. M. S. Murphy, of
Castle Grove Rev. M. Lonergan, Ma
son vi lie and Rev. J. M. Molloy.
After the mass was ended the Arch
bishop conducted his examination of
the class and the answers given show
ed that no part of their training had
been neglected. He then delivered a
most instructive and interesting ser
mon that elicited many facts about
the Catholic church and its teachings,
hitherto unknown by the children as
well as many of the old people pres
ent. At the close of his remarks the
sacrament of Confirmation was ad
ministered.
The services concluded with the
Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament,
the choir singing as the closing hymn,

GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH
ROBERT.
Robert Barr, the democratic nom
inee for senator, is a prominent Dela
ware County farmer. As
A
farmer and
business men he has been successful
and his business acumen and judg
ment are rated high among the people
of his own community. He is pecul
iarly fitted to represent Buchanan and
Delaware Counties, both in the matter
of good common sense and judgment,
and in his sympathies and understand
ing of the needs of the agricultural
interests. He is not a politician in
the ordinary sense, never buried any
party or sat up with the corpse, never
"hollored"' down a rain barrel to hear
the echo of his own voice, but he can
be depended upon to represent the
business interests of the people of his
district.—Independence Conservative.
It Is Now Postnaster Forward.
Edge wood Journal: J. W. Forward
took charge of the local post office on
Monday morning, having received his
official appointment from the govern
ment as the new Democratic Post
master. Although he filled this same
positno for the term prior to 1897,
he finds the work changed a great deal
and many new rules to learn. Miss
Emma Steele will continue as Assis
tant for the nex few months at least.

A JU8T CRITICISM.
Independence (Bulletin -Journal^:
Local autoists who have visited the
fish hatchery at Spring Branch, near
Manchester, register a vigorous kick
against the Delaware county board of
supervisors. They claim that Dela
ware county chould show its appre
ciation of what Uncle Sam has done
for it in locating the fish cultural sta
tion there by making the road which
leads from the Hawkeye highway to
the hatchery grounds more like a
real highway. They aver that the
hatchery is visted by people from a
radius of 50 miles or more every sum
mer and that there should be a de
cent roadway leading into the grounds
from the main highway.
