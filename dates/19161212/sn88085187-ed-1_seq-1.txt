GERMANY ASKS FOR PEACE
Proposes to Neutrals That Negotiations Be Started!
PRESENT IS BEST OF ALL
TIMES FOR GERMANY TO
ASK PEACE, SAYS EXPERT
BY J. W. T. MASON
United Press Historian of the War.
~SJEW YORK, Dec 12. —Germany's proposals for peace are made at a time
when her armies have taken the offensive in the newest battle area and when
the western front has reached another deadlock.
The peace that Germany now wants is one with Teutonic troops occupying
enemy territory on practically every front.
The war is yet far from having gone to the knockout that David Lloyd-
George demanded in his United Press interview a short time before he became
the British premier.
On the contrary, Germany's position now is not that of a beaten antagonist.
The Germans occupy at the present moment probably the highest position
they will reach, as far as practical purposes are concerned, no matter how long
the war continues.
They have a clear road to what they regard as the center of their future co
lonial empire, in Asia Minor, and they are holding in check every movement to
break through the German defenses.
It would be, therefore, greatly to Germany's advantage if a peace could be
secured on this basis.
Nevertheless, Germany's losses in man power are becoming constantly
much greater than the losses of any one of her principal antagonists.
At the same time, the British government has just undergone re-construc
tion for the purpose of carrying the war to a more bitter conclusion, and
France, too, is evolving a scheme for greater efficiency. Under these condi
tions, while Germany is not overthrown, the German militarists may well feel
that the future developments of the war cannot hold out for Gei'many any bet
ter prospect than the ceaseless killing of proportionately more Germans than
Frenchmen or Englishmen.
Germany must make large concessions to secure peace at present — far
larger than are indicated by the war boundaries onihe map. But whatever Ger
many proposes as a basis for peace, in her first declaration, probably will not be
her final word. The most important fa^t of Germany's new attitude doubtless
will be the definite statement of tentative peace terms, which later may be taken
as a starting point for future elaberation and a possible settlement.
MAYOR WARS ON "LAW TRUST"

"But it Is, no use to appeal to

the mayor in an official state

Tacoma attorneys recently set

Announcement of her campaign,

Friends in Taconia of the beau

She watched his car on the Taco

—By handing the note to the rep

transmitted it directly to her
enemy nations.
Under existing conditions this
is the only possible course of
diplomatic interchange between
the Central powers and the en

The diplomatic representatives
of America, Spain and Switzer
land will forward the note to
their respective capital*.
The foreign offices, or state de

These ambassadors will, in

Mrs. Hughes was in l.os An

her of the death of her husband

Hughie had intended to return

The widow was stricken with

something else has come to Mrs.
Hughes—an undying hatred of
the sport which took as its toll
her husband's life.
"My husband was Blain!—that

presses it," says Mrs. Hughes.
"He lg a martyr to the thing
the world calls sport.
Is a Man-Killer.
"The shocking fate my husband
met forcefully points the reason
why autmobile racing should be

outlawed because of its brutality,
yet racing is permitted in spite
of the fact that it yearly takes an
appalling toll of life, not only In

neutral nations, shall make pro

This does not mean, however,
that the IT. S. would not transmit

What the Terms Are
H'niicd Press I eased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.—Germany's peace proposals, according to Ger-i
man embassy officials will include a suggestion that the territorial status of the \
nations engaged be returned "practically" to what it was before the war started.!
Ihe exemptions are establishment of independent kingdoms of Poland!
and Lithuania and some readjustment of international boundaries in the Bal-JP
On the latter question, it was said the situation is so complicated that it is \
bardaTthis time definitely to suggest anything like positive terms that would be ••
accepted by all belligerents.
The one concrete suggestion made is that Bulgaria will want the return of§
the territory she lost in the second Balkan war and it is supposed Germany guar
anteed this when Czar Ferdinand cast hi s lot with the central power*
The peace terms, the United Press informant said, include the evacuation of
northern Jn-ance, restoration of the kingdom of Belgium, at least a partial restor
ation of Serbia and Rumania, and the return to Germany of her lost colonies.
The factors which are said to have led to the German peace proposals at tliitf
time are:
The favorable military position of the central powers.
The fact that the winter at hand will necessitate cessation of hard fightina
for three months. °
A desire to "smoke out" the allies to announce just what they are fightimr
for.
Desire to convince the world and the German people wherever they are that
Germany is not fighting a war of territorial conquest.
