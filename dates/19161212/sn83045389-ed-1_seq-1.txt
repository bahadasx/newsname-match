President to Keep
His Entire Cabinet

WASHINGTON. December 11. ? Every
member of President Wilson's Cabinet,
with the possible exception of Attor
ney-c ;ene ra I Gregory, Is' expected to
remain In oftlce after March 4. when
tli* president's second tcr'ni begins.
It was learned definitely to-day that
:ill of them have been, or will be.
asked to keep their posts.
Reports con **niing possible resigna
tions have centered chiefly around Sec
retaries McAdoo. Houston and liaker
and the Attorney-Oeneral. It has
been taken for granted that Postmas*
ter-General Burleson and Secretaries
Lansing. Daniels and Wilson would
remain, and indefinite rumors that Sec
retary Itcilllclil might wish to tot ire
to private busine:<;j wep' denied some
time aRO.
Secretary McAdoo to-day personally
; denied that he had any intention of
resigning.
Hegarding Mr. Houston, it be. atne
known that the official.-' of Washington
t'niversity. at St. I.ouis. have extended
i his l^ave of absence as chancellor of
that institution, so that he can con
tinue a? head of the Department of
Ai;rieu)tu; e.
Although Secretary Raker lias been
credited with a desire t>> leave the
. Cabinet, it Is learned that. In all likeli
hood. he will remain. It is thought,
however, that he may be shifted to
the Department of Justice if Mr.
Grojrory Insists on resigning. an<l that
Vance ? ' Mi't'onnl'k, chairman of the
Democratic: National ''ommlttee, may
be placed in charge of the War De
part ment.
I!i the A t torney-'Jeneral's case, the
reports about bis in|ention to reslyn
have been very circumstantial, and
have been generally accepted by ?
ficials as true. although he has given
no indication of hie intentions. The
President has offcreii M r. Grejsory :
s?;it In the Supreme Court once. and.
should another vacancy occur during
the administration, it is thought prob
able he would be seriously considered

WASHINGTON', December 11.?The

be the first vessel designed and built
for this purpose by any nation, accord

annual report was made public to-day.
Every convenience of an up-to-date

"When completed," the report says,
?'it Is believed the ship will represent
a model ship of this class for many
years to come, and her usefulness may
well be expected to continue during
the lifetime of those who had a hand
In her designing."
A slight increase in both hospital
admission and death rate in the navy
for the year is shown by the report.

circles, but the bulk of the disburse

found is the large number of boys and
girls that have registered in the sav

every week. That the unique banking
plan is exceedingly popular is shown
by the increased membership from
' year to year.
Outstanding among the hank an

increase shown by the Mechanics* Sav

bank increased its accounts this year

. Two years ago this bank had only 100

.Mrs. Addic Detroit Atkinson, Vir

Motel Richmond. ;ui institution which
she founded and developed into one
of the tin est hostelries in the South,
rhoutrh she had be.-n in failing health
for two months, her death was not
believed imminent. However, that she
believed the ?nd near was attested by
the fact that several limes last week
she voiced th? opinion tliat .she had
!?ut ii few hours to live.
Mrs. Atkinson had been routined to
her bed for about ten days, but re
gained her faculties until the end.
Two months ago site was reluctant to
give tjp her active duties as proprietor
and manager of the hotel, txit her en
feebled condition made this impera
tive. and she was from that time on
confined ?? ? her apartment.
No funeral arrangements were made
last night, but will probably be an

Mrs. Atkinson was regarded as one
of the most remarkable women in
Richmond. I'rom a start as a salaried
employee of a small Lynchburg hotel
she rose to the heights of conceiving,
building and owning a hotel plant
which is valued not far from $1,000,000.
?She died at the age of seventy-nine
years. leaving behind as a monument
to her memory one of the largest
hotels in Virginia.
Leaving her native home in Amherst
County, Mrs. Atkinson went first to
I.ynchbtirg. where she was connected
with the Wall llotel and later the
Warwick House, t'oming to Richmond
in 1SSI, she was ilrst connected with
the old St. .lames Hotel, and in 1SS9
she identified herself with the Amer
ican. now the Lexington Hotel. In
lfHH she found herself in a position
to carry nut a long-cherished dream?
nuilding a hotel of her own. The
llotel Richmond rose on its site at the
northwest corner of firace and Ninth
Streets, overlooking' Capitol Square. In
1011' she completed the huge addition
to the Richmond at a cost ? of about
? too, t?00.

Mrs. Atkinson gave such close per
sonal attention to her business affairs
that she found it impossible to allow
time for other pursuits. Women's or
ganizations of various characters,
realizing her worth as a business wo
man. frequently besought her counsel,
which was freely given, but no attrac
tion held out could induce her to take
any time away from her duties as
active head of the hotel, and she,
therefore, declined all invitations to
afliliate herself with any leagues or
clubs. The only membership she held
was in the Second Presbyterian Church.
Several days before her death Mrs.
Atkinson expressed the wish that upon
her death there be no signs of mourn
ing at the hotel. She expressly re
quested that the customary musical
programs rendered by the hotel orches
tra l>e continued without interruption.
Mrs. Atkinson was the widow of John
M. Atkinson, who died in the early '!?0s.
She leaves the following, children: Mrs.

Schools, yesterday improved ?< plan
whereby children will ?? si two days
bring old papers and magazines to
School, whi-rc they will he collected
and sold in bulk. Tlie proceeds will
he proportionately divided unions the
schools. the funds to !?<? used for the
purchase of libraries. playground
equipment o- any other purpose for
which it may be i^e'.ed
The paper-saving plan will cofI the
rhl'dren nothing ex<-ept a few minutes'
work, while the s liim' funds should
reef'v" considerable impetus. Dr.
Chandler has set aside Friday niorn
iuii of tliis week and Thursday morn
inn of next w-ek for the collection of
the papers and maeazines. The chil
dren will bring them to school, where
later in the day they will be weighed
and hauled away. The Times-Dispatch
will provide motor cars for collecting
the paper, and will do all of the in1
'ouutinc connected with the sale and
division of the proceeds among the
schools In proportion to the amount
of paper collected by each. Tt Is ex
pected that the paper collections will
reach a total running into thousands
of pounds. Paper is selling now at a
hiirh figure.
Mil.I.IONS OK POI'XOS
W ASTKI) IN Hit IIMWXn
Millions of pounds of paper of every
kind are wasted annually in Rich
mond alone. In addition to the news
papers. there arc hundreds of thou
sands of pounds of magazines brought
here each year, while the amount of
wrapping paper is stupendous. The
larger proportion of this is burned or
wasted in other ways. If a reasonable
percentage of all paper used In this
country was saved in a systematic
manner, it would greatly aid In con
serving the diminishing supply.
Knch school child should In two
weeks be able to collect twenty-five
pounds of paper. If this is done, the
25.000 pupils of the Richmond public
schools would bring in 625,000 pounds,
which, at the lowest rate, would mean
a fund of more than $5,000 for the
schools. In t h<- city of Washington
the school children quickly raised
$1,250 for the playgrounds of that
community. Richmond could easily
hotter that mark if the boys and girls
put their hands and brains to work.
Not only newspapers, hut waste
paper and magazines, should be saved
by the children. Waste paper brings
the lowest prices on account of the
cost of handling. Newspapers come
next, while the magazines are worth
almost double. An armful of papers
brought in on Friday by each school
boy or girl would mean hundreds of
dollars to be invested in the better- |
inent of the schools, while a real bun
dle from each one would bring in 1
thousands of dollars.
COMIIIXKI) KKKORT Wll.l. .
niti.Mi noon pricks!
Dr. Chandler is highly pleased with |
the proposition, which can be carried J
on without a cent of c?st to the school I
system. The fact that in practically
r.verv household there are scores of
old papers and magazines waiting to j
be hatil.'tl away makes the scheme
practicable. In the average home It
is, tot worth the time or trouble tc
send for a dealer to haul away tho
pnper, as the amount must be largo
to be handled with any profit, il'id, j
consequently, the accumulation of pa-,
per becomes a nuisance. With buui- .
ness houses, hotels and office build
ings the situation is different, as the ,
waste paper soon mounts up and is i
worth disposing of to the dealers.
Even then it is necessary to have ex- j
pensive baling machines to sell waste ,
paper profitably. j
Kvery school Is in need of a fund :
to make small purchases. Playground]
equipment, such as Indoor baseballs,
tennis rackets, volley balls and similar J
articles, are always in demand. Talk- ;
ing machines and records add to the ,
attractiveness of the school, while!
motion-picture machines would be In
valuable. In fact, there are many
ways in which the money could be
spent profitably.
It has be^n suggested that the John |
Marshall High School Cadets might!
find the paper-collection scheme an :
admirable one to help pay for the
overcoats that the corps so badly
needs. John Marshall High School has I
nearly 1.500 day pupils. All arc large (
enough to lug a good-sized bundle of
papers or magazines to school on Frl-j
day morning. If each one expended]
u little effort and inconvenience to j
bring twenty-live pounds this week
and twenty-live pounds next week, the
high school would have a total of
7 5,n00 pounds, which would bring in ;
a sum in excess of $i?00. This h ould ,
be a great help In securing the needed
equipment.

NKW OIU.EANS. December 11.?In
i one of the most exciting sessions ever
| seen on the exchange here, cotton de
' dined 131 to l?l points under Satur
day's close, due to effects of the rov
' ernment's forecast of the size of 1016
cotton crop. The estimate of 11.511.
000 bales as the. total production was
considerably above general expecta
tions, and the January position sold
down to 16.65. which was 334 points
below the highest price of the season,
made two weeks ago, or a loss of
I about $20 a hale compared to the high
Art ii res.
So fluctuations equaling to-day s
changes have been seen on this market
in this season of heavy trading. A
f (?w minutes after the figures were
flashed from Washington prices began
breaking ten to twenty-live points be
tween trades. March's first sale lost
forty-two points, one of the widest
changes between transactions ever
recorded on aJi active month.
Offerings came largely from disap
pointed holders of long contracts, who
expected an estimate of not exceeding
11 300,000 bales, and few on the floor
were prepared for the government's
figures.
1 Shorts commenced taking profits
largely, but their buying steadied the
tone, and caused a material reaction.
I the market closing at a net loss for
! the day of seventy-two to eighty-nine
| points.
