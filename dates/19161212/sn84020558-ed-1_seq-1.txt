WASHINGTON, lH?c. 11. The at
tention of congress was dire .tent
tdiarply today to mutters relating to
loth the army and navy, which are
Xeted to be productive of agita
tion for even more drastic measures
of national defense tnan have yet
Jeen seriously considered.
Secretary Daniels, before the house
naval committee, advocated legislation
which would compel steel companies
mid other private concerns to Rive
preference to government orders for
military supplies. He will submit a
new section for the pending naval
appropriation bill for this purpose in
order to hasten battleship construc
tion, which he declared was being
lelayed by commercial work both In
the yards of private builders and in
the steel plants.
Secretary Baker wrote Speaker
lark in response t a house resolu
tion that 71.34 out of the grand
total of 163. Si0 rational guardsmen
taken into the federal service up to
August 31, were without previous
military training. Rejections of en
rolled guardsmen for various causes
cperated later to increase the num
ber of recruits to approximately HO
ler cent tt the force.
In this connection also, army of

universal military training in the
1'nited States as urged in the re.mr
of Major General Hugh L. Scott,

It became known that the officials of

he can continue ns head of the de

Although Secretary Raker has been
credited with a desire to lepve the

stiod. however, that there is a possi
bility that he may be shifted to th

Insists on resigning, and that V.inco
