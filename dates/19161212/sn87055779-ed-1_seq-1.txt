WASHINGTON, Dec. 12. Progressive-republican
senators made

investigation of campaign expendi
tures preceding the last election and

The Austro-German center. in
eastern Wallachia, has forced a
crossing of the Jalomitza river and
is driving against the Kusxo-ltou-manian
Hank on the Kuzeu-Misilul

Within the past three days the
ninth army of (ierman allies in Rou
manial has captured more than 10,000
prisoners.
In th" wooded Carpathians, on
the Smotrie and on the lialu-builova
sector the Russians renewed their

InternatJon.il News Service:
WASHINGTON. Dec. 12. News'
of the German peace proposals
created a profound impression here,
but in otlicial circles mere was ut
most reluctance to discuss Chan
cellor von Bethmann - llollweg's
proffer until all the information laid
before the neutral envojs at Berlin
is at hand.
It was agreed on all sides that
the veto power that means peace or
war rests entirely with Great Brit
ain. The success or failure of the
move, accordingly, is in the hands
of the new premier, Lloyd-George,
now recognized as practically Eng
land's dictator.
There was a general disposition
to regard the peace statement of
the German chancellor as an ex
ceedingly shrewd step, even though
the tertns laid down prove unac
ceptable to the entente allies, it
being pointed out that it would at
least enlist widespread sympahy in
neutral countries.
Fnollicial intimation that Ger
many planned a peace move reach
ed the white house in advance of
the Rerlin announcement, it was
learned.
From the information in the
possession of administration officials,
it is understood that the purpose
of the German allies is to hrinc
representatives of the vvarrlns gov
ernments to at least the informal
discussion of some basis for peace.
It is not expected in Berlin, ac
cording to ollicials here, that the
first proposals made for peace,
transmitted to France, Great Brit
ain and Russia, will be accepted.
The ultimate real aim of the Ger
man government. some officials
said, was to ascertain the terms ac
ceptable to the entente allies for a
basis on which to discuss peace.
Moip Was Kxioctcl.
State department orricials said
that it was not altogether surprising
that the peace move came from
Germany at this time. They point
ed out that the victories on th
Roumanian front spoiled the plans
of the entente governments to carry
out their military policy of forming
u rinp of steei around the German
armies and "forcing the. nation to
its knees."
Information that Germany in
tended to inaugurate a peace move
was transmitted to the e mbassies oi
the French, liusslan and British
governments.
Ambassador Jusserand of France
lefused to be seen when the infor
mation reached the embassy. Möns.
De Jean, acting counsellor of the
embassy, said that the embassy "dirt
rot want to hear anything about it."
At the other entente embassies
there was a distinct atmosphere of
doubt regarding Germany's sincer
ity of purpose in offering1 to enter
peace negotiations.
Await Otlitial Word.
Administration otheials here in-
lined to believe thoroughly in the
sincerity of the move, however.
They refuse to commit themselves,
however, until otlicial word is re
ceived confirming press dispatcher.
The recent route of the Roumanian
army, opening to Germany the
means of feeding its population, it
was pointed out, puts the Teutonic
allies in a position to demand far
more favorable terms than they
could ha', e lu d the pea' e move been
made a few weeks ago.
The fact that the move was made
after Germany was in a position to
demand more than it eojld a short
time ago may influence representa
tives of the entente allies strongly
against the negotiations, otficiuls
here fear.
