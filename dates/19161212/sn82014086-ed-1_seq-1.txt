ATTORNEY GENERAL GREGORY
ONLY MEMBER TO RETIRE
ASKED TO KEEP POSTS
S.cretary Baker May be Transferred
to Place Made Vacant by - Gregory

tary of War Houston Retention
Most Desirable.
Washington, Dec. 11. Every member
of President Wilson's cabinet, with the
possible exception of Attorney General
Gregory, is expected to remain in of
fice after March 4, when tne presi
dent's second term begins. ' It was
learned definitely . today that all of
them have been- or will be asked ' to
keep their posts.
Reports Denied. .
Reports concerning possible- resigna
tions have ' centered chiefly around
Secretaries McAdoo, . Houston And
Baker aid the attorney geuerar. It
has been taiten for granted that Post
master General Burleson and Secre
taries Lansing, Daniels and Wilson
will remain, and indefinite rumnrs that
Secretary Redtield might wish to retire
to private - business were denied some
time ago. .
Secretary McAdoo today personally
denied that he - had any intention of
resigning. The reports in his case
have been most persistent in spite of
aemals oy omcials .close to the presi-
lerit.
Regarding Mr. Houston, it became
known that the officials of Washington
university at Kt, Louis have extended
his leave of absence as chancellor of
th.-vt , institution so that he' can con
tinue as head of the department of
agriculture. Because of the lnvestiga
tions into the high cost of- living and
other important work undertaken by
fcecretary Houston, the president is
known to consider his continued" ser
vice in the cabinet as highly desirable.
Baker Likely to Remain.
Although Secretary Baker has been
credited with a desire to leave the
cabinet, it is learned that in all likeli
hood he will remain. "It is understood,
however,- that there in a possibility
mat ne may do snittea to trie leiKu-t

on resigning and that Vance C. -Vic
