Steel Wobbly
New York, Dec. 12—The stock
market became groggy today on news
of Germany's peace move. United
States Steel sold at 121%, off two
points. Crucible slid down 2% points,
.selling at $0.75.
Entire Market Weak.
The entire market was wabbly, witb
such great confusion that ticker re
cords, of sales and quotations lagged
far behind the actual transactions.
The war brides felt the force of the
peace announcement of the German
oh-sellor to an even greater extent
than did ,the standard issues. There
was a scramble of trading in these
stocks, mobs of brokers signalling and
howling orders around the Steel and
Munitions posts.
Market Grows Quieter,
The first flurry of excitement was
followed by quieter trading, when the
traders declared their belief that a
peace proposal from Germany at this
time does not mean peace.
Big Hour's Business.
During the first hour 489,000 shares
were sold. This is a big hour's busi­
ness, but by no means a record. On
the curb losses in several of the more
active munition shares during the first
few minutes amounted to only one or
two points.
The market suffered the second
Blump at 2:30 after recoveries had
been made in most stocks.
United States Steel again is leading.
Steel sold at 118%, oft 1%.
Prices were at their lowest today.
United States Steel was down 5%, at

Stocks were again dumped on the
market in the last few minutes, Steel
celling below 118 wire orders for the
west were said to have been behind.
At the second selling rush the
2,000,000 shares mark was crossed at
2:40. The market closed weak.

JUSTICES-ELECT ALSO ON
JOB IF THEY ARE NEEDED
WILL SEEK TO HOLD
UP' JUDGES' (SALARIES
Fargo, N. D., Dec. 12.—Notices
will be served on State Auditor
Carl Jorgenson and State Treas­
urer John Stcen warning them
against paying salaries for the
month of December to retiring.
Justices Fisk, Burke and Goss,
William Lemke. attorney for Jus
tices-elect 'Robinson, Grace and
Birdzell, announced today.
At the same time, the three jus­
tices-elect, ignoring the decision
of the provisional court, handed
down yesterday, will present
vouchers for a month's service on
the supreme bench and will de­
mand that the same be paid.
This proceeding will, it is be­
lieved, throw the entire issue into
the courts once more, through
mandamus proceedings directed
against the state auditor and
state treasurer, and fathered by
either trio of justices which may
fail to get its pay. By the time
this action can be returnable, the
new justices will, it is claimed,
have taken their seats, and
when the case reaches the su­
preme court, they will constitute
a majority there.
North Dakota's original supreme
court, declared by the provisional su
preme court to be the state's only leg
ally qualified supreme court until
January 1,1917, Jias resumed the even
tenor of its way and today is busily
grinding away on opinions in cases
which have been argued.
'The old supreme court evidently an
ticipates no further trouble. It has
quite a lot of business to close up be
fore the end of the year, and it is go
ing ahead with it, just as though noth
ing had ever happened.
Robinson Still Here.
Of the justices-elect, only James E
Robinson remains in the city, Grace
and Birdzell returned to their respec­
tive homes last week and were not in
Bismarck when the decision of the
provisional supreme court was handed
down. Judge-el?ct Robinson stated
today that so long as the retiring
members persisted in hanging on to
their jobs until the first of the year,
no doubt they would be permittW to
do so, but that a day of reckoning
looms up in the not too distant future.
Lemke Talks.
William Lemke of Fargo, speaking
for the judges-elect, stated last eve­
ning that the decision of the provi­
sional court would not be accepted or
given consideration by the justices
elect. "They have refused to recog­
nize the provisional court, and there­
fore probably will not accept the de
cision," said Mr. Lemke.
"Undoubtedly any proceedings be­
fore the retiring justices will be sub­
jected to review by the new court
when the latter is given final posses­
sion of its prerogatives. As for salary
payments, we believe state officers
handling pay-envelopes will use their
own discretion in this matter and that
they will accept the contention of the
justices-elect that they, rather than
«l-e outgoing judges, constitute the
supreme court of North Dakota."

Aviating Meat Prices Found in

PACKING HOUSE COMBINE
STANDS IN THE WAY
Control of |Big Industry Fast
Getting Into Hands of Few
Men
(Editor's Note: This is another
in a series of stories by Corres­
pondent Burton, in which he is
trying to find out the reasons for
the present skyrocketing of meat
prices in America, and what rem­
edies there are for this, if any.
This article, and those following,
take up and examine, the meat
situation in the United States to­
day more thoroughly and accur.
ately than it has ever been done
before.)
By H. P. BURTON.
Chicago, Dec. 12.—The "breeders"
and "feeders" of live stock in this
country constitute what are technic
ally known as the "tho live stock inter­
ests," and a great proportion of them
are directly or indirectly affiliated
with a huge but rather loose organi­
zation called "The American National
Live Stock association." its presi­
dent is Dwight B. Heqrd of Phoenix,
Ariz., and its other officers are drawn
from the great and little ranches that
range from Texas to Wyoming arid
from California to Illinois. They are
absolutely unified in their contention
that only a government investigation
of proportion and purpose, instituted
and carried to an effective climax can
straighten out the meat problem of
the American people.
The occasion chosen for'llife'putting
forward of their viewpoint lies in the
recent introduction into congress of a
resolution by Congressman Borland
of Missouri, asking some such official
action.
The strategic question, above all
those relating to increase costs of
feed, land, labor, etc., that is in the
mind of the producer, as elicited by
hearings on this resolution seems to
be this:
Controlled Market.
Is it mainly due to a controlled
market that the price of beef on
the hoof is subject to such con­
stant- fluctuations, resulting in
great breaks and losses for the
producers and are these fluctu­
ations largely controlled and ma­
nipulated by the packers and not
altogether the natural ones fol­
lowing the normal changes in sup­
ply and demand? and if so, how
can this be remedied?
This condition—namely that of a
"controlled" market if it exists, is ab­
solutely fatal to his business from the
standpoint of the producer, and im­
mediately, explains his lassitude, in
asmuch as he must at all times be
reasonably certain of the price his
product will bring, and especially so
of late- years with costs of production
all steadily rising.
Live Product.
The man who sells cattle for a IIv
ing, it will be seen, deals in a very
precarious product. He is not trad
ing in some static, manufactured arti
cle like nails or buzz-saws or phono­
graphs—some object not subject to
rapid deterioration. Instead he is
dealing in a live product, a thing that
must be disposed of at the very mo­
ment it is ready for market. It must
be shipped exactly at the moemnt it
is "finished," and before it has con­
sumed its weight in feed costs it
must needs be sold the moment it
reaches its destination at one of the
big live stock centers for it will soon
eat its head off, destroying all pos­
sible chances of profit. In addition,
while in transit, meat animals are
subject to loss in weight, to possible
injury or even death, in addition to
various other sorts of wastage—all of
which militate sharply against the
pocketbook of the producer.
Such contingencies are bound to be
fraught with more or less tragedy,
of course, for the man who is selling.
On. the oth^r hand, they are "pie" for
the man who is buying, especially if
the latter should happen to be buying
largely in "harmony" with other buy­
ers. The men who buy in this case
are the big packers with home offices
in Chicago. They are known to have
especially good business heads be­
cause they are all of them rich be­
yond the dreams of avarice. There­
fore one is more or less tempted to
give pause before the cry of the pro­
ducers to the effect that it is not that
they take exception to the packers
taking advantage of the legitimate
"pie" in this game, but that what they
do object to is that in buying cattle,
the packers bake "pie" where there
was really no legitimate "pie" in sight
at all!
The packers, they go on to charge,
are expert multipliers of "pie" first,
last and all the time, and they have
announced that they are heartily tired
and sick of watching the antics of
these "overfed little Jack Homers,"

British Are

PeaceTerms
Foreign Office iWill Make No
Statement Until Allies Have
Been Consulted
BELIEVED GERMAN WINTER
CAMPAIGN ONLY STARTED
Teutons Equipped With Snow
shoes, Wagons and Devised
Sleds
London, Dec. 12.—The British for­
eign office this afternoon will ihake
no statement regarding Germany's
peace proposal until the terms propos­
ed from Berlin are officially known
and the powers of the allies have been
consulted.
With the German army at Buchar­
est, which is Field Marshall vop Mac
kensen's headquarters now, Ger­
many's campaign is only started.
Every Gerfaan soldier is fitted out
with snow-shoes, wagons and devised
transfer sleds for the winter cam­
paign.
Favored by ideal weather, the forc­
es of Mackensen and yon Falkenhayn
have acquired such a momentum
since the fall of Bucharest that they
are able to swing further into Ru­
mania. By the fall of Bucharest they
are able to swing masses of artillery
in all directions with a clear line of
communication. The complete demor­
alization of the Rumanian forces is
said to have perimtted Mackensen's
forces to advance with small losses.
As General von Kluck declared in
an interview with the United Press,
"one cannot postpone the ppportunity
to fight, if he expect* to win the bat­
tle, and General Mackensen is work­
ing on this theory."
Operations north ofMacedonia
have tieen mindered by snowfall. The
allied forces have taken small Bulgar­
ian towns on the right hf^nk of tho

The district term of court for Bur­
leigh county opens tomorrow with a

petitions have been filed with the
clerk of the court. At 2'clock tomor­
row afternoon the jurors will report
for duty.
The first criminal case on the cal­
endar to be tried will be that of the
state against Frank Johnson, a garage
man at Regan, N. D., who is charged
with a statutory offense, the complain­
ing witness being a school teacher of
that village. Johnson is at liberty on
bail bonds.
According to State's Attorney Bernd
the case of the state against P. J. Dur­
ant, charged with attempt to kill with
a dangerous weapon on the opening
day of the hunting season, and the
case of the state against Albert E.
Marquett of Bismarck, charged with
kidnapping the 15-year-old daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Michael Balzer of this
city, will come up this week.
The calendar for this term of court
was called th$s morning with an array
of attorneys before the court. A num­
ber of cases have been settled. About
16 criminal cases are to be tried, sev­
eral being from out of the county, fil

Expressions Heard Everywhere
That Christmas May See Ces
ation of Hostilities
Washington, Dec. 12.—Germany's
peace proposals, according to German
embassy officials, will iqclude a sug­
gestion that some territorial arrange­
ment be made and it was rumored
here that the Gerpian Empire is ready
to return the boundari.es of Europe in
status quo before the war.
It is impossible as yet to get any­
thing official on the terms. It was
hardly credited here, that Germany
would make any definite terms yet un­
til the temper of the belligerents
could be ascertained.
Excitement was at high tide here
today. Hurried conferences were
called. Congress was agog over the
Yuletide prospects for peace. Every­
where there were expressions that
the overtures of Germany would be
met and that a cessation of hostili­
ties might be proclaimed as a Christ­
mas benediction for the world.
It is thought Germany will be con­
tent with trade concessions and a rec­
ognition of her sphere of influence in
the iBalkans and India territorial con­
siderations may be waived for trade
and colonization privileges.
No Comment.
"No comment at this time" was the
first word sent out from the White
House after Secretary Tumulty read
the United Press dispatches rela­
tive to Germany's peace proposals to
the White House officials.
He would not say whether this
meant that anything would be given
out later. Copy of the United Press
dispatches were rushed to the White
House by special messenger. Sec­
retary Tumulty read them and rushed
to President Wilson.
When the German ambassador.
Count von Hernstorff, received the
wireless message from Berlin inform­
ing him of Germany's peace propos­
als, he sent word to the newspaper
correspondents that he would have an
interview later.

By J. wTtTMASON.
New York, Dec. 12.—Germany's pro­
posals for peace are made at a time
when her armies are taking the offen­
sive on the west battle line and when
the campaign has reached the stage
of another deadlock.
The peace that Germany wants is
one that will leave Teutonic troops
occupying territory now held.
War is far from settled. David
Lloyd-George demands a knockout. On
the contrary, however, Germany's po­
sition is not by any means that of a
beaten antagonist.

General .1

cause of his success in turning the
Teutons back in the battle of the
Maine, is to-be succeeded by General
Petain, the defender of Verdun. An­
nouncement of new cabinet and plans
are expected hourly.
New blood for old, economy and effi­
ciency for wastefulness and lack of
concentration in the government ad­
ministration is what Premier Brian
is aiming at in his reconstruction.
The public generally believes that
Joffre will go. He will not be tetired
from service, but be transferred from
active command, probably to heading
the war council of the ministry.
IN "II" OF
Word has been received from James
Blunt, son of Mr. and Mrs. C. W.
Blunt of this city, who was badly
burned about the face while working
in the chemistry department of the
University of Minnesota, that he was
getting along nicely in the university
hospital. The accident happened while
he was making a test and was caused
by a defective glass tube. The flames
struck him around the right eye, but
it is thought the sight is not injured.
Milo .Miller, son of Attorney Andrew

the hospital the last of the week and
will return to K'ismarck to spend the

Direct Overture.
By handing the note to represent­
atives of the United Slates, Spain and
Switzerland, Germany really transmit­
ted it directly to enemy countries.
Un.der existing conditions, this is the
only possible course of diplomatic ex?
change between the Central Powers
and the Entente. Diplomatic repre
sentatives of America, Spain and
SwjtzetlancJ forwarded the note hand­
ed them by 'Ilollweg to their respect?,
ive capitals.
The foreign office of each nation
will transmit the text to the repre­
sentatives of the Kntente Powers sta­
tioned at the various neutral'capitals.
Same Procedure.
In (rase of peace proposals, the
same procedure will be followed.
..hould the belligerent nations see lit
to reply, tho answers will be handled
the same as Germany's tenders.
Kngland, for instance, probably will
give the representatives of America,
Switzerland and Spain identical notes,
detailing the response to Germany's
proposals.
These would be dispatched to Unit­
ed States, Spain and Switzerland
through diplomatic channels and hand*
ed to Germany by the representatives
of those nations at Berlin.
Csancellor llollweg's announcement
of Germany proposing peace was
couched in the following words to the
reichstag:
'Conscious of their responsibility
before God and before their own na­
