REPORT OF COMMISSION.
Would Cut Tax Rate From 55

Bipartisan Commission.
Louisville. Ky., Dec. 11. A recon
struction of the tax system of the state
of Kentucky is expected to be effect
ed at a special session of the legisla
ture which Governor Stanley probably
will call within a week to consider a
report submitted to him by the state
tax commission.
The chances would b'o made by the
adoption of three bills that have heen
drawn up by the commission, the
most important features of which arc
the creation of a strong bi-partisan
board empowered to force intangible
property on the tax books and to im
pose fines for failure to declare prop
erty, the reduction of the state tax
rate from 55 cents to 40 cents, the
exemption of taxes on stocks of
companies having one-fourth of their
property in the state and paying taxes
on all the property in. the state, and a
tax of one-tenth of one per cent on
bank deposits.

SWORN STATEMENT YESTERDAY
Smith Said He Had Not Talked
' Him Not To Tell
Frank Smith, the Cerulean Springs
liveryman, yesterday came to town
and calling at th office of County At
torney Ira D. Smith, made a sworn
statement in which he identified the
woman who gave her name as Kathe
rine D. Denton as Miss Helen Can
nell. of Alton. 111. He said she had
several brothers and sisters at Alton,
one of the brothers in the hardware
business. He said he first met Miss
Cannell while she was keeping a to
bacco store and news stand on La
fayette avenue, St. Lonis, about a
vear ago. He was in tne namt oi sen
intr tobacco in small quantities and
nmc n c i miic nn tnnt nnsinpss ai

tion with.
He was again in St. Louis from Jan.
to April of this year and saw her
again, but only had business deals
with her. She told him she had been
a school teacher, and that her parents
were dead and her home had been in
Alton.and that she was nevemarried.
Some, time later he was in St?L'obts
and learneu mat sue imu uuscuiiui

Lieut. Hawkins. Miss Cannell asked
him to lend her $100 and he told
. her he was not in a position to do so.
' She then asked him to bring her back

BERLIN ADVANCES
German Submarines Sink 7
Steamers Quiet On All
Other Fronts.
London, Dec. 11. Little fighting;
except by the artillery, is in progress
on any of the fronts except in Rumania.
Here the Teutonic allies, according'
to Berlin are still making progress
against the Rumanians in eastern
Wallachia. Fetrograd asserts, how
ever, that the Rumanians northeast ot
Bucharest, along the road running
from Ploechti to Buzeu, have turned
on the offensive and driven the Aus
tro Germans back westwaad. To the
north along the Transylvania Ruman
ia frontier. Petrograd reports gains
for the Russian troops and Berlin ad
mits the capture by the Russians of a
height south of the Trotus valley..
A move by the Bulgarians which
may prove a menace to the Rumanians
retreating eastward from the Buchar
est region, is reported by Berlin.
This is the crossing of the Danube be
teween Silistria and Tchernavoda
sfcljtheast and east of Bucharest. If it
was mauo in iargeiorceseem4ngiy aii
impediment will bo placed in the way
of the retirement of the Rumanians
possible some of them may be caught
between the Austro-Germans moving:
east and the Bulgarians driving north
across their line of retreat.
Aside from a German attack in tne-
Vosges region near Col Sainte Marie,
which was repulsed by the French
and the Germans of a sap in Charrt
p.igne which the French had entered
after its evacuation, only bombard
ments and minor engagements have
