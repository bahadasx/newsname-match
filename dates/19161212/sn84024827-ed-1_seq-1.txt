WASHINGTON, Dec. 11. Every

with the possible exception of Attor
ney General Gregory expects to re
main in office after March 4. when
the President's second term begins.
It was learned definitely today that
all of them have been or will be asked
to keep their posts.
Reports concerning resignations
have centered chiefly around Secre
taries McAdoo, Houston and Baker,
and the attorney general. It has been
taken for granted that Postmaster
Burleson, Secretaries Lansing, Dan
iels and Wilson would remain, and In
definite rumors that Secretary Red
field might wish to retire to private
business were denied some time ago.
Sretary McAdoo today personally
denied that he had any intention of
resigning. Regarding Mr. Houston, it
became known that the officials of the

that he can continue as head of the

Secretary Baker has been credited
with a desire to leave the cabinet. It
is learned that in all Iiklihood he will
remain. It is understood, however,
that there is a possibility that he may

ing, and that Vance C. McCormick,
chairman of the Democratic national
committee, may be placed in charge
of the war department.
. In the Attorney General's case the
reports about his intention to resign
hove been very circumstantial and
have been generally accepted as true,
by officials, although he has given no
'ntimatinn of his intentions. The
President has offered Mr. Gregory a
seat on the supreme bench once and
should a vacancy occur during the

Mr. Wilson will renew the offer.

rBv Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11. While the
immigration bill, passed by the House
at the last session, was meeting un
expected opposition in the Senate to
day, it became known definitely that
Piesident Wilson will veto the meas
ure if it goes to the White House with
the literacy test provision, one of its
chief features.
Races Undesirable
The President early in his adminis
tration vetoed a similar bill for the
same reason as President Cleveland
Cleveland and Taft had done before
bin. but advocates of the legislation
had hoped that he would not withhold
his signature thiB time if substantial
majorities were given in both houses
of congress. Debate on the bill in the
Senate developed into a general argu
ment over the question of exclusions
ot aliens on account of race.
.The Jap Problem
Senator Works of California started
the discussion by giving notice that
he reserved the right to determine a j
separate vote on a senate committee i
amendment providing for exclusion of
Hindus and other Asiatics by pre
scribing geographical areas from
which immigrants shall not be admit
ted without enumerating races. The
amendment, recommended by the
state department after inquiries had
been made by the Japanese govern
ment respecting provisions of the bill
as it passed the House, eliminates all
reference to the "Root-Takahira pass
port agreement" regarding Japanese
immigration. Senator Works insisted
that this would leave the United
States at the mercy of Japanese dic
tations as to immigrants from that ;
country. As treaty rights are Involv- j
ed, the Senate went into executive
session for the debate, which lasted
more than an hour without a vote.
Object to Africans j
In open session Senator Reed read
an amendment to include the contin
ent of Africa within the limits set by
the committee. He said he would fav
or any legislation which would keep
out of the United States any persons
not of pure white blood, but he did not
think it proper for congress "to ex
clude by law and admit by diplomacy"
Inherent Objections
"I believe," said Senator Reed, "the
time has come when we ought to keep
our country from bing filled with peo-
pie not capable of becoming first class 1
citizens, who, by birth, environment
or disposition are not qualifiedjo per -
