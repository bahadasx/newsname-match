KAISER SENDS
BELGIAN REPLY
Answer to U. S. Protest
Explains Attitude on
Deportations
Berlin, Lee. 11. The Secretary of
Foreign Affairs, Dr. Alfred Zimmer?
man, to-day handed to the Secretary of
the American Ea B I f, ?' "ph C. Grew,
the German reply to the American rep?
resentations on the Belgian deporta?
tions. This is a memorandum explain?
ing the Gel man attitude.
Through the Spanish Fmba??y at Bar?
lin, which i? ? tl Belgian, the Bel?
gian gevernaienl protested against the
transportation of Belgiafl workingmen
to Germany. This protest, say? the
semi-official Overland New- Agency, has
not been acceded to.
The order of the German Governor
General at Bruaaela on May li stip?
ulated that persons who enjoyed pub?
lic charity and nevertheless refused to
accept or continue at work would bu
punished by confinement or forced em?
ployment, '/.en though this order has
been carried out, no means contrary to
international law have been employed,
the news agency say.?-', since Paragraph ,
?1.1 of the Hague Convention makes
obligatory the maintenance of public
order by an occupying power, and If I
the lawn of the country are insufficient,
permits the iaauanc? of additional or- ?
dors.
Denies "Sienr? of Terror"
The agency continue.-.:
"Public order without doubt implies
that able-bodied peraona, ao far as po?i-;
sible, should not impose themselves
upon public charity.
"The orcujia'.ir.ii of Unemployed per-'
? .? municipalities waa naos condi- ?
tional on the remic-t of the German ad?
ministration only m order that the en
dangeriag af then financial situation
ahould be mad? impossible.
"There wer. BO Hit nes of terror dur*
ir.tr the transport of the vvorkingmen,
which wa? don? without any harshness,
and with all possible consideration.
Neither in Germany nor in th? occupied
parts of France and BelgiUfll were the
unemployed coerced to do work con
tr-.r;. to the law of nations."

P' <?'?:? '? Th? Tri? ?
London, Dae. 11.? First report** of
Premier Lloyd (ieorge's illness gave
the political world a slight shock to?
day, but his condition is not serious,
and is due to the overstrain of the
last week.
Although he was unable to go to
Buckingham Palace with the other
members O? his Ministry to receive
the seal of oflce from the King, his
doctors announce?! that he was suf?
fering from nothing more than a
severe chill and would be out in a
day or two.
The belief is widespread here that
Lloy*d (iVorgc will appeal to the coun- j
try in a genera! election as soon as j
Ye gets his Cabinet "team" going'
smoothly, and that his administra?
tion will be returned to power with
a great majority.
Will Meet Common? Thundaj
Lloyd George Brill meet the Commons'
for the tir-t tIBBS as Premier on Thurs- '
day, when the vote on new war credits;
will give :he members an opportunity
to debate almost any subject they wish
to raise. The new ?Premier sent the!
following message to-day to each mem?
ber of the Commons:
"The King has intrusted me with the
task of forming a government. I have
carried out the command. I had hoped
to make a statement to the House on
I'uisday. I now lind it impossible. Onl
Tuesday Mr. Honai Law, as leader oil
the House, will move adjournment tillj
Thursday.
"The one predominant task before!
the government Is the vigorous prose-1
cution of the war to a triumphant con-1
elusion. I feel confident the govern-i
ment can rclv on your support a* long
as they devote their energies effectively?
to thai end."
List Well Received
Public reception of the official list;
of the new ministry is extraordinarily
friendly. Nowhere is exception taken
to the inclusion of new blood. The :
onli doubt raised is whether men lik'r
Sir Albert Stanley and Herbert A. I..
li lier, who wem not previously mem
bi r- of Parliament, will be able to up-;
hold the work of their departments
in debate.
The city generally welcomes the new
ministry. Financiers feel great ad-'
miration of the work of Lloyd Ceorge
at th.? outbreak of the'war as Chan
cellar of the Exchequer, ami they also
believe thai Bonar ?Law, having had
practical business experience, will
make a better Chancellor than Keg
mal?! MeKenns, who eras regarded as
too gr.'Bily influenced by the Uan? of
England. MeKenna's insistence on
i- term lonns has never been popu
lar.
The necessity of reelection for scv- ]
eral members of the new Cabinet will ,
po tpone a general settling down, but ?
confidence is felt generally in their?
ability and BSaCeess.
Minister-? (?et Seals
Ronar Law and the other ministers
who are not required to seek reelec?
tion on as?umption of office, together
with the Lords in the new Cabinet,
went to Ruckingham Palace to-day,
kissed the bands of the King and re?
ceived their seals of office.
In the next SOSB?OB sf 'he Common?,
former Premier Asquith and his Lib?
eral followers will t??k" opposition
benches to the left of the speaker. The
Labor partv will be split, as the In
depoadont Labor faction also will cross

The Irish Nationali?t?, whose atti?

characterized hy the Berlin correspondents of the Dutch
newspapers as "the'most remarkable since the outbreak of
the war and of worldwide historical importance."
All the members of the Reichstag, even those in the
fighting line, have been summoned to Berlin by telegraph.
Bethmann-Hollweg to-day received the ministers of all the
federal states, and discussed with them the subjects which
he will bring up in the Reichstag.
It is said that his statement has been received with ap?

simultaneously.
Berlin. Dec. 11.?Interest in the Reichstag session to
morrow is intense. The demand for tickets of admission sur?
passes all precedent during the war.
The speech of the Chancellor is expected to consume half
an hour. The Reichstag will adjourn immediately afterward
without debate.
BRITISH NAVAL
DRIVE AWAITED
German Admiral Says
Jellicoe Will Seek
Out Teuton Fleet
Berlin. Dec. 11 ?by wirele?? to Sav
villa). Rear Admiral Kalau von Hofe
comments in the "Vossische Zeitung"
on the recent change in the high com?
mand of the British navy, which, in his
opinion, indicates also a change in the
methods of British naval war_aj__ .
"Instead of cool calculation, the ?
British naval warfare henceforth shall
be guided by a spift of enterprise,"
says the admiral. "The German navy
will hail with satisfaction this change
of mind on the part of its main enemy. ?
What dangers this change implies for
the neutnls can hardly be foreseen.
"On the blockade the admiral is
ready to ge to the verge of rupture
with neutrals. He has particularly in?
sisted that the British navy ought to
open an offensive and not hesitate to
search out and annihilate the enemy.
Refused to Risk Fleet
'The former British plan was to risk
?he British navy in no circumstances.
The German navy being encircled in i
homo ports was thus supposed to b^ j
inefficient, while the forced idleness of,
German merchant ships would consum- '
mate the downfell of Gtrmany. As to |
the German sut marine warfare. Bag
land expected to master this problem
by diplomatic influence on the neutral?. :
"At the same time the possibility wa?
admitted that the German navy by an
'act of despair' might search out th?
hiding place of the British navy in the
high North Sea, but there it would
tignt under the most aafavorabl?
.strategic .circumstances.
"The i.ritish plan was, at all events,'
to destroy in the peace conference
whatever waa left of the German navy
and save the British navy for great
future problems in the Pacific Ocean.
This British plan, however, has failed ?
in every respect.

brought in steaineis to Zeebrugge.
"Further proof of the inefficiency of

GREECE FACES
STERN ACTION
Allies Plan Ultimatum
as First Step in
Final Solution
London, Dec. 11. The Entente Allief? ?
are working out a "very radical" solu?
tion of the Greek problem. This was
announced to-day by the Foreign Office.
The first step, according to well in?
formed observer?, will be the presenta?
tion, probably to-morrow, of a new note
demanding the complete demobilization
of the Greek army, the ?assumption by
the Allies of control over sll railroads,
telegraphs and posts, and the release of
all imprisoned Veni.elists.
Force la Threatened
A repetition of the forceful measures
taken by Admiral du Fournet two weeks
ago will follow any refusal of King
Constantine's government to accede to
the new demands, it is understood. Un- !
der the threat of a Teutonic attack on
Sarrail's army in Macedonia and of pos?
sible Greek intrigue against the Allied
forces the Entente authorities have de?
cided that only the most drastic meas
Bros will hold the Greeks in hand.
.Although the latest advices from I
British officials) in Greece report con?
ditions well in hand, large numbers of
Entente Nationals are continuing to
lea''e Athens. The Allied authorities
are tr.king stricter measures for the
censorship of messages sent from
Greece. Wireless messages from King
Constaatine to Berlin have been inter?
cepted by the Greek battfeship Hydra,
which is under the control of the Al?
lies, according to advices received to
day.
King CoaataatlaS continues to lose
supporter-. IHo-Kntente faction? in
the ?"yclades, a group of Greek islands
in the aigean, have revolted; ?all the
Greek settlement? in Kgypt have re?
nounced their tllegiance to Constan?
tino, and the inhabitants of Canea,
(rete, have proclaimed the dethrone?
ment of the monarch, according to dis?
pitches received to-day.
Brand King a Traitor
"I.a Liberte." of Paris, prints a re?
port that the piople of Canea severely
denounce 1 ?'onstantine at a mass meet?
ing, which phs?ed the resolution de?
claring his dethronement.
The King was branded as a traitor
for haviig turned the i.rms of Grc'ce
against the sons of the liberators of
the nation and the guarantors of its
independence, and for his attempts
diplomatically to crjate a policy con?
trary to the traditions, interests atid

Both Sides Claim Success

London. Pet. 11 The fighting on
th?; Macedonian front has grown more

have changed hand? several times.

Idol of Armies Makes
Way for Younger
Generals
BRIANDS SAGACITY
SAVES HIS PLACE
France. Tired of Mistakes,
Sacrifies Her Hero
for Victory
Br Cab!? to Tha TT ?
Pans. Dec. 11.?Joffre, the idol of
France and its armies, must make
way for new blood. This is the (great
and almost traffic result of the re?
cent ferment. ?
Franco is house cleaning because
the French want to get on with th?
war. The people no longer care for
personalities; winning the war is the
only thing that counts. The lessons
of Rumania and Greece have made
p. big impression on the public?so
big that the French people demand a
change in the high command.
The changes in the Ministry are
of minor importance, merely the
eddies of a great wave of public
?pinion sweeping over the military
command. The raiiical racialist?
are using it to get a stronger repre?
sentation in the government, but the
soldier is the only man who count?
now.
Mr land Save? Himself
Briand's ability to sens? public
opinion and his cleverness in saying
the right thing at the right time
have saved him in a critical situa?
tion. To outsiders, however, as to
the French general public, the
changes in the high command occupy
the chief position of interest.
Joffre is to be "kicked upstair?."
He will possibly command the Allied
War Council, where his experience
, will be of the greatest value to the
| Entente, although he will be shorn
of actual power.
Ranks with Joan of Arr
France consider, that ha? has dona
more for his couniry than even ,lo?n
of Arc, but that he h.s given of his
best, and that he must make way for
new men, for fresh ideas and for
greater energy. Nothing proves the de?
termination of the French more than
their decision thus to shelve their idol
of the war.
Who is to succeed Joffre i? something
that probably will be decided this week.
The choice seem? to lie between Nivelle
and Petain, with the odd? favoring the
former, who was the hero of Potiv.i
mont and Vaux in the great Verdun
battle. A graduate of Polytechnic, V.
velle was an unimportant general be
fore he was called, last April, by Petain,
then in command at Verdun.
Nivelle Extremely Popular
It was Nivelle who condacted the who.e
operations that resulted in the recap?
ture of Douaumont and Vaux and the
sweeping in of six thousand prisoner?,
thus offsetting the work of months by
the Germans. Naturally, Ni velle is ex?
tremely popular with the army and peo?
ple, though he la personally known to
few.
General Petain is a slightly o!d?-r
man, of strong character and great en?
ergy and ingenuity. There are other
candidates, but these two are the fa?
vorites. One report . I that Nivelle is
considering the offer.
l.rrat Campaign Fiprrtrd
Within this month great changes will
be teen in the military situation in
Greece, with France playing a strong
hand. The situation, it ia believed here,
will be something like this:
The \ictorious German army of
Mackensen will come down toward
Monastir, bound to retake Mor.astir and
open the way for the entrance of
Greece into the war on the side of the
Central Powers. Sarrail's forcea will
not only have to face this army, but
must also ?guard themselves from the
Greeks on the rear.
Nothing would surprise the AIHe?
now, not even a declaration of war
against them by King Constantine.
The latest demands of the Kntente are
expected to be used by that monarch
as a pretext for sparring for sufficient
finie to organii.e his forces, i.very on?
BXpeeta that h.? severance with th?
Allies will be only a matter of day.? or
week?.
France Tired of Miatake.?
France has a vision. She ha? no
stomach for further mistakes in th?
war. such as that of Rumania. The
French admit that the Rumanian blow
is a hard one. but one due solely to the
Rumanians' disregard for the warning
of the Allied general against the dan?
ger of the Tran?vlvanian campaign he
fore Bulgaria was disputed of.
Bvaa Russia'? early offer of a
anee was ?corned. But now the mil h
