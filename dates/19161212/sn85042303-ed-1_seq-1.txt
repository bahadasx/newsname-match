LOANS MUST BE GUARDED
AGAINST, ACCORDING TO COM
MISSIONER. , Oklahoma City. Okla. December 12.
-At the annual meeting of the Okla
homa Slate Hankers Association here
today. J. 1). I.ankfnnl, state bank com
missioner in an address cautioned the
deb cat es against making excessive and
loii!; time loans, lie pointed out that
caution, prudence and judgment should
In- used by bankers In all their trans
actions at this time. .Mr. I .auk ford's
address, in part, follows:
"I want to warn you against making
excessive and long lime loans against
a large volume of deposits which lire
subject to laim.sjiale withdrawal. If
ever there was a time in the history of
this country when bankers should use
eaution, prudence and judgment, that
time is now. There is great danger of
ovi r-conlidence, anil the banker who
used the greatest care and conserva
tism In considering loans and dis
counts anil stays close to the shore,
will avoid the 'breakers' ami In my
judgment lie the only one who will
safely steer clear of the danger mark.
The 'safety first' Idea, if always borne
In mind and acted upon, Is 'y mighty
fortillcation against disaster and de
struction. "Another thing which has lx-en
brought about by reasoa of the de
velopment of the state's great re
sources and the creation of wealth Is
the lowering of Interest rates, and we
must be content with smaller margin
of profit than heretofore injoyed.
"Another matter of importance is
the great necessity of building up,
from time to time, your surplus ac
counts, thereby giving your banks
greater strength, and also serve as a
mighty bulwark In times of stress.
This matter should receive your con
sideration. "In referring to the recent require
ment directing that 50 per cent of
legal reserves !e carried with iitate
banks operating within the state of
Oklahoma, I will say that the commis
sioner has ri-ccivcd protests from both
state and national banks and a recon
sideration has been requested.
"None but the state banks of Okla
homa furnish depositors full and com
plete protection and you should call
yourselves "State Bankers" with a de
gree of personal pride, realizing that
you are operating your bank under the
