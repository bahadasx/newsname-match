then. Insisting upon the achievements
of the central powers, made an announcement
which nossiblv rnav be the t
turning point in the war which for
more than two years has held the world
under its spell. The chancellor said:
The reichstag had not been adjourned

SENATORS FAVOR

/
Increase in Pay Generally Is

Cost of Living.

An increase in the pay of the government
employes is generally advocated
by the members of the Senate
particularly in view of the rapid increase
in the cost of living.
The action of the House committee
on appropriations, however, in reporting
the legislative, executive and judicial
appropriation bill, with horizontal
increases for employes receiving
$1 800 a year and less, failed to meel
the approval of a number of the senators.
In the first place, senators said the>
believed the increases proposed were
not sufficient in cases where the pay ol
the clerks was too low, and that in
cases where the pay was adequate foi
the service rendered the increases were
too high.
Senator Kern's Views.
"I do not believe that it would he

"Many clerkS are inadequately paid today,
others are fairly well paid for the
services they render. 1 am in favor ol
increases in pay for all those whose
pay is inadequate. But some other'plan
must be devised for bringing about
these increases."
Senator Chamberlain, member of the
appropriations committee, said:
"As a general proposition I arr
heartily in favor of increasing the paj
of the civil employes of the government,
particularly in view of the increased
cost of living."
Senator Martin, chairman of the committee
on appropriations, while expressing
himself in favor of adequate
pay for the employes of the government,
said he preferred to study the
matter, which must be handled by his
committee, before expressing ar
opinion.
Favors Pension System First.
Senator Pomerene of Ohio, chairman
of the committee on civil service, expressed
the opinion that the first thing
to do was to provide an adequate retirement
and pension system for the
clerks, and then to give attention tc

tablishment of a retirement system,
weeding out the superannuated employes,
he argued, would bring about
many increases in pay of employes
through promotions.

the appropriations committee, whilt
withholding comment as to the desirability
of granting increases ir
salaried to the clerks on the ground
that as a member of the committee he
would later have to pass upon the
questions involved, said he believed the
only right way of bringing about increases
in pay for the government employes
was to go into the various classifications
and to determine what worh
was done by the employes and what the
work was worth.
He said a horizontal increase in paj
might well result in the increased pa]
to employes who should not receive it
and at the same time, the horizonta
increases proposed by the House committee
might be far too low in justice
to other employes.
Senator John Walter Smith, chairmai
of the Senate District committee anc
also a member of the appropriations
committee, said he favored an increase
in pay for the government employes.

Premier Briand announced today that
he had completed reconstruction of the

premier is expected to make a statement
to parliament tomorrow.
Premier Briand, speaking: to a group

t PARIS. December 12.?There was tu
mult in the chamber of deputies yes
ter'day during the discussion of the
' military appropriations hill, when the
. socialist deputy Pierre Brizon spoke.
IM. Brizon was violently interrupted

i longer fight to assure the possession of
1 Constantinople -to Russia. "You're a
traitor!" was yelled at M. Brizon by
numerous deputies.
Various colleagues of M. Brizon eni
deavored to quiet him, but without
avail. M. Bouge and other deputies
, requested the stenographer to take
' down nothing said by M. Brizon. During
the Excitement M. Brizon grasped
? a water glass which stood before him
, land threw it at the heads of the depuI
ties in a semi-circle before the secre'

When the hearings In connection with ?

print paper were reopened today in the ! r
New Willard Hotel, publishers from all i t
i Darts of the country, particularly pub- j v
lishers of the smaller dailies and the \
! weeklies, appeared to give figures t
j showing the increases in the cost of j ^
j paper. Many of them told the commls- j 0
| sion that it now was practically im- I it

j creases reported by these men were j ^
| generally from about $2 to $6 per hun- j L
I dred pounds. j t<
I T. T. Ansberry, representing the j J.

j ciation, said that his members had lost j t-j
I interest in t he commission's inquiry in j
; view of the fact that it already had '
j made public a report in which the | y,
j commission apparently had formed its
(conclusions on the investigation. He j p
{said he saw no reason for going on
i with the hearing at this time. At any,
j rate, he said, it was unfair for the com- j
i mission to hand to the manufacturers j
j present on the day of the hearing a i
i mass of statistics and expect them to j
give testimony on them when they had "
not even had a chance to examine them, b
He asked for an adjournment to give 0
the manufacturers time to study th? ,
statistics. The commission went right'
ahead with its hearing, listening to the ^
testimony of the publishers. c
Contracts for Full Output.
H- B. Varner of Lexington.. N. P., told
the commission that he had letters from tl
paper-manufacturing companies saying a
that they had contracted for their full a
output of paper for 1917. Pressed by |J
Mr. Ansberry for copies of the letters, i !T
Mr. Varner said that they had been j b
placed in the hands of the Department J
of Justice. He also charged that one j Ir
publisher was unable to get even a quo- ' J
tation on paper because of his activity ! ?
in testifying at previous hearings of 0
the commission. Commissioner Davies n
asked for the name of this publisher for a
the confidential use of the commission j ^
4 and Mr. Varner said he would give it
this afternoon. He said that he prob}
ably would have to furnish his own
j name for the same reason if he coni
tinued his activities.
Arthur W. Dunn of this city, representing
the American Press Associa- I
tion, an organization of 4,500 papers, t<
mostly weeklies, said that tabulations i tl
of about thirty letters received from !
members of the association showed that
two years ago they paid from $2.25 to
$3 per hundred pounds, and that they
now were paying from $5.75 to $8 per h
hundred. He said they now were com- &
pelled to pay the freight and that they
do not now receive discount for cash. n
He promised the commission that he F
would tabulate information contained B
in many other letters which he had re- P
ceived, and would furnish the tabula- h
tions and the original letters for the ti
confidential record of the hearings. nr
o
All Experience Difficulties. b
o
All of the publishers told of the diffi- =
culties of obtaining supplies for their
publications.
It was brought out that prices vary
largely and that publishers buying direct
from mills obtain their paper much
cheaper than those buying through Jobbers.
L. B. Palmer, manager of the American
Newspaper Publishets' Association, said
the price generally throughout the country
would exceed 3 cents a pound on contracts
when purchased direct from the
mill. One mill, the Great Northern Paper
Company, he said, however, had sold
paper recently at less than 2% cents.
Paper prices in Georgia, according to
R. L. McKenney of the Macon News
and the Columbus. Ga., Sun. vary greatly.
He had purchased paper, he said.

Citizens' Federation Would
Show Need of Economic
Preparedness, Too.
ID BE AT INAUGURAL TIME
High cost of living, national preparedness
against both economic and
military foes and the unamerican
tatus of District citizenship will be
eatured in the big educational symposium
of "Uncle Sam in his workhop."
which the Federation of Citiens'
Associations, in co-operation with
he federal government, will arrange
or the entertainment of Washington's
naugural visitors next March.
The high cost of living problem in its
principal phases, together with what
he Department of Agriculture, backed
p by the parcel post and other govrnment
agencies, are doing to lower
rices will be presented on a scale calulated
to convey suggestions of the
reatest practical value to every home
i the country.
To make this the big, outstanding
eature of the exhibit was practically
etermined upon last night by members
f the federation who met in the boardoom
of the District building to conider
preliminary plans.
Ir. Colladay's Suggestion Approved.
The suggestion came from Edward
\ Colladay, chairman of the commitee,
and was enthusiastically approved,
fr. Colladay also suggested the prearedness
idea, while Jesse C. Suter
roposed a District of Columbia exibit
which would be instructive as
d civic conditions obtaining here, esecially
pointing out that District resients
do not enjoy the political rights
hat are conferred by the Constitution
) citizens of the states.
So impressed were the members by
he opportunity presented for expandig
the educational scope of the exibit
until it reasonably may be exected
to benefit immeasurably both
itiT.fns of th* District and the coun
ry at large that Chairman Colladay
ras instructed to appoint a subcomlittee
to get into immediate touch
'ifh the various government depart- j
lents.
The committee consists of Charles S. j
hreve, president of the federation, i
hairman: Edward F. Colladay and I
ITiliam McK. Clayton, chairman and!
ice chairman, respectively, of the gen- j
ral arrangements committee; George j
I. Russell, Allan Davis and D. A. Edwards.
The committee will start active work
omorrow. It will pay its first visit to
ames L. Wilmeth, chief clerk of the
'reasury Department, and during the
fternoon will visit the chief clerks of
ther departments to ascertain to what
xtent government co-operation in the
mdertaking can be expected. Infornal
assurances received by the .pomnittee
already Indicate, it is stated,
hat there will be no lack of co-operaion
on the part of the government departments
and establishments.
Would Invite Citizens of States.
The genera! plan of co-operation as
roposed by the federation is that this
ody shall extend an invitation to the
eople of the country on behalf of the
itizens of the District to visit the
rational Capita! during the week preeding
inauguration: that it shall arange
for reduced railroad rates and
be general entertainment features,
rhile the government departments j
hall furnish the exhibits and be in en- j
ire charge of that end of the under- I
.King.
Last night's meeting was addressed
y Morton F. Leopold of the bureau
f mines, who stated that arraneelents
already had been begun by that
ranch of the federal service to hold a
ational conservation exhibition in
Washington at inauguration time. Mr.
eopold said the bureau would be glad
) co-operate with the federation, and
e predicted the same would be true
f every other government department.
Chief Clerk Wilmeth of the Treasury
epartment had exported to attend the
teetinsr and give his indorsement to
ne general plan, but illness detained
im at his home. He sent word that
fie co-operation of the Treasury Deartment
could be counted upon.
Possible Sites for Exhibit.
There was considerable discussion as
d the best place for installing the exibit,
the National Museum and the
uilding now under construction to be
ccupied by the Interior Department
eing the most favored. One of the
uties of the subcommittee appointed
LSt night will be to ascertain which, j
' either, of these buildings can be
btained.
Representative Cantrill, chairman of
fie House committee on industrial arts
nd expositions, is preparing to send
n inquiry to all members of the cabi- I
et this week as to their views on the I
roposed exhibit. Mr. Cantrill's conilittee
has b ?fore it the bill introduced |
y Representative Tinkham giving the |
pproval of Congress to the federaon's
plan and authorizing the governlent
departments to participate in it.
ust as soon as replies from the cablet
members have been received Mr.
antrill said he would call a meeting
f the committee to take action on the
leasure. The bill does not call for an
ppropriation. and it is believed that
ongress will approve it at an early
ate.
Proposed Action by Congress.
By a joint resolution, introduced in
tie Senate today by Senator Saulsury
of Delaware, an invitation is exended
by Congress to the people of
tie United States to visit the District
uring the week from February 26 to
larrh 4. to view* the Capital city of
heir country and to inspect an exibit
of the various activities of the
overnment service.

WANTS U.S. TO OWN
TELEfHONES IN D. C.
I Representative Lewis Introduces
Bill to Take Over
Entire System.
j ONE-CENT CALLS PROVIDED
| A new attack on the cost of living
i was delivered today by Representative
| David J. Lewis of Maryland, who in
troduced a comprehensive bill for govi
ernment ownership of telephone sys|
terns in the District of Columbia. The
i bill provides a one-cent night rate telej
phone call, to ha used especially in
icirimuuinK 10 iarmers in me nrsc
parcel post zone. While this feature
of the bill is important, and is designed
to facilitate communication between
city consumers and farmer producers,
it is not the entire bill.
The present telephone system, says
Mr. Lewis, is not used enough in Wash*
ington because of excessive rates.
Under the Lewis plan ihe Post Office
Department would take over the system
and by establishing lower rates
would produce a telephone usage much
higher than at present, and on profitable
lines, according to Representative
Lewis.
Mr. Lewis Ezpains His Plan.
An explanation of the scheme was
made in a statement by Representative
Lewis today He said:
"For experimental purposes the bill
fixes a low* night rate for the use o(
farmers and consumers, within the first
parcel post zone about Washington,
permitting direct dealing in farm products.
The night rate is one cent for
each ten miles of distance, plus one
cent initial charge, and is available
only for food transactions. During the
day, from 9 in the morning to 5 p.m..
this rate Is doubled; half rates for
added time. The first parcel post zone
is about fifty miles in every ciirectlon.
Low as is the rate proposed, it is somewhat
higher for fifty miles than the
telephone rates prevailing in Europe.
Mr. Vail of the Bell Telephone Company
has declared that they could give rates
'more or less equal to those In Europe*
and make a profit, too,' but that the
American people do not want them. It
remains to be seen whether he is sight.
Whether so or not. the wires are nearly
entirely idle after business hours and
at night, when the housewife and farmer
are at home, they might well use
these idle wires to facilitate buying and
selling their food supplies through the
parcel post.
"At present the toll rates are pre-.

Washington is coinplctely environed
by farms, they oannot be reached
within a practicable cost by telephone.
while letter communication Is.
impracticable; for the transaction,
however small, requires the bargaining
conversation. Take Poolesville. Montgomery
county. Md. It is a farming
center within twenty miles direct dly
tance of the District. The toll rateyfs
20 cents for three-minute talk; of
course, prohibitive. The night rate under
the bill would be 3 cents, which
would make it as easy to give a phone
order to a Poolesville farmer as to the
grocer in the city. What likely would '
happen is that the farmer, who also
would enjoy the rate, would phone a
list of his products and prices to cen-.
tral for information, which would thus
evolve into a clearing house for farm
supply information, and be able to direct
the housewife to a farmer actually
having the supplies desired. In this way
the prudent housekeeper could get such
necessaries at their first price and with
their first smell. ^
Best Place to Make Experiment.
"The Washington telephone situation
would seem to be an inviting one for
,V.{c rectal oviiorimont Ita nnctol
chiefs are there, and could settle all
problems with the light of direct experience.
Moreover, the telephone report
for 1914 shows that the average
charge for each local call in Washington
was about 4*4 cehts. This Is
more than four times the average
charge per call with the independent
companies in such cities as Pittsburgh,
Indianapolis, Kansas City, Louisville,
Fort Wayne and Buffalo. The telephone
user in these cities pays 97 cents for
100 local calls, which in Washington
cost an average to the user of $4.21.
The effect of these high rates is to
produce a ridiculously low use of the
phone in Washington. In 1914 it averaged
only 823 calls. The average for
the cities named was over 2,700 calls
per phone. The investment cost per
phone averaged fully as high in these
cities as in Washington, and their telephone
employes attended to about
forty-five phones each, while in Washington
the average was fifty-two phones
per employe. But in these cities the
employe showed an average service product
of more than 100,000 calls per employe
per annum, while in Washington
the employes showed a product of less
than 50,000 calls. Here is a case in
which an increasing demand for the
service greatly reduces the unit cost.
I High utilization means low cost per

higher use. The potential traffic, is as
high in Washington as elsewhere, but,
just as with the parcel traffic befors
the parcel post, most of it is killed bjr
the relatively prohibitive tarifKa
exacted.
The prevailing rates simply disinherit
the masses in respect to this moat
recent and useful communicating?and
properly postal facility. The hotels
here, as in other cities, have extension
phones in each room: some of them
more telephones than in ten residence
blocks around them.
