NEUTRALS MUST ACT
DECLARES HOLLAND
German Treatment of Eelgians
Described as Atrocious ;
Details Given.
LONDON, Pec. 11. (6 p. m.)
The Associated l'ress has received
from Amsterdam "an appeal to the
American people" by the Holland sec
tion of the league of neutral states
signed by l'resident Nclmoyer nnd
Secretaries Delafallo und Walch. It
follows:
"Your president has kaid that soon
er or later a moment would come
when tho war would make tho posi
tion of neutral nations unbearable.
For us Hollanders that moment has
arrived; not thru our own sufferings,
but because wo can not longer pas
sively contemplate the ghastly suf
fering Inflicted by Oermany ywn
Belgium, our neighbor.
Families Dragged Apart.
"The eloquent protests of the l!el
glan government and of the higher
clergy have acquainted you with the
Tacts. The Hague regulations stipu
late that 'the honor and rights of the
family must bo respected." but the
Herman government deliberately
drags the Belgian fumllies apart. To
us this cruelty is more vivid every
day. Kvery day
numbers of fugitives,
i in
spite
of
the deadly electric wire
which tho fiermans have erected
along the frotier, succeeded in
escaping to Tl: Netherlands. From
them we learn the painful details of
tho unutterable despair of the women
and children who aro left behind and
of the agonizing scenes whic h take
place when husbands, brothers and
sons dragged from their homes and
women folk are packed into cattle and
freight cars and thus truuVported
slaves ti an unknown destination und
to un unknown fate.
Action by Neutrals I'rged.
"To put an end to this to arrest
this hellish scourgo which at this mo
ment lacerates the whole of northern
Franco and western ltussia there is
but one way nnd that is collective ac
tion on the part of the neutral na
tions. "And for you, citizens of the might
iest of the neutral states, It Js in our
opinion the right and duty' to take
the leadership upon you. Only if you
place yourselves at our head can nny
success crown our efforts. Ameri
cans, we a.ts convinced that you will
not disappoint our expectations."

SOLUTION OF WAGE
QUESTION PROPOSED
Elisha Lee Suggests Interstate
Commerce Commission
Should Handle It.
NEW YORK. tec. 11. Regula
tion of wages by the same commis
sion that regulates rules may im me
ultimate solution of tne ranroua
wage problem, according to Kllsl.a
le, chairman of the national con
ference committee of the railway
who addressed the Economic club
here tonight on the question, ".Shoull
the right of public service employes
to strike be regulated by law?"
"I am not prepared to say that all
wuge problems of the railroads
should be placed unreservedly in the
control of a public .commission,' said
Mr. Lee, "but I do believe thu,t when
a controversy between the manage
ments and the men reaches u stage
where the interests of tho public are
imperilled that then there should be
a compulsory peaceful settlement, u
judicial settlement that will conserve
the public Interest as well as the
rights of the parties to th contro
versy. If any body of men are re
quired In tho public interest to sub
ordinate their private rights to their
public duties it should be with tho
full understanding that their rights
must be In every way safeguarded by
thu public.
"We aro at the parting of tho
ways. One road before us Is a con
tinuation of the system of unre
stricted private wage but-gaining that
eventually leads to settlement by
force. The other road Is a restric
tion und regulation of private wage
bargaining for the protection of the
rights of the public trial by Jury
instead of trial by brute force."

WILSON APPROVES
HIGH PRICE PROBE
Assures District Attorney An
derson of His Support;
Asks Aid of People.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11. General
approval of tho Investigation being
conducted by the department of Jus
tice Into the Increased cost of living
was given by President Wilson today
at n conference with District Attorney
Anderson of lioston, In charge of the
inquiry. Tho president will continue
the examination of facts collected by
various department.! before ieelding
whether any remediul legislation shall
be recommended to congess.
It was said tonight by officials con
nected with the Investigation that
their chief hope for the ultimate low
ering or the coat of living lies in
simplifying tho means of transpor
tation of foodstuffs, the pracjlce of
economy by tho public, increase In
production by farmers and thru other
such methods rather than by the
prosecution of lawbreakers.
Indications are, however, that the
program for Immediate uction al
ready outlined will be followed with
little modification. This includes
general investigation or the activities
or alleged coal and food speculators
and a closer Inoiiiry into the relation
between the high cost of living und
the shortage of rreight curs.

which, In his oeln'on. Indicates also
a chani'e in the methods of llriilsh

agency gives out tho following quota
tions fro... the udinirul'H urtlcle:
"Tho former Kritlsh plan was to
risk the Krllbh navv under no cir
cumstances. Tho German navy being
encircled In home ports was thus si.p-poi-pd
to be Inefficient while the forced
Idl'-ness of German .merchant ships
would consumate the downfall of Ger
many. As to the German submarine
warfare, England expected to muster
this problem by diplomatic Influence
on the neutrals.

"At the same time the possibility
was admitted that the German n.ivy.
by an 'act of despair' might search out
the biding plui'e of the Kritlsh navy ill

fight under the most unfavorable

"The Kritlsh plan was at all events

"I'lirther prrtof of the Inefficiency
of the Kritlsh navy Is the increasing
difficulty In the transportation of m
munition and other
eonlrahand 'and
the growing scarcity
of food III Eng-
lund.
l(cMirti Not Trusted.
"In the face of these facts the of
ficial reports of .he Kritlsh admiralty
were no more trusted by tho pumie,
the general feeling of uneasiness In
creased nnd the result was H change
in the high command of the nuvy.
Also the Kritish plan to right our sub
marines by the aid or neutrals failed.
Iteeent utterances' of the Kritlsh
government In parliament show an at
tempt to inflame and to instigate by
diplomatic means the ostracism by
neutrals of submarincx of the navy
and merchant submarines and that
the government wus resolved to arm
all Kritlsh merchantmen! as quickly
as possible and order them to open a
deadly fire against submarines on
sight." These ships shall he armed
more completely than before, not only
with one cannon at the stern for de
fensive purposes, but also with can
non on the forecastle and at the sides
which make them prepared for at
tack. As to the blockade, the ad
miral Is ready to go up to tho vergo
of rupture with neutrals He has par.
ticularlv Insisted that tho Kritlsh navy
onelit to oi.en an offensive and not
hesitate to search out and annihilate
the enemy."
Enterprise, IVrl.nps,
Hear Admiral Kalau von Hofe ex-
Dresses the opinion that these words
will be followed by corresponding ac
tions and continues:
"Instead of cool calculation the
Kritish naval warfare henceforth
shall be guided by a spirit or enter
prise. The Gerinun navy will hall
with satisfaction this change of mind
on the part of Its main enemy. What
dangers this change Implies for the
lieutruls can hardly be foreseen."
