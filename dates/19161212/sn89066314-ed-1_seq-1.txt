Germany's 'enemies immediately. Theproppsal which Ger

4 Says It Wont Affect War.
By United Press
LONDON, Dec. 12.- Today's vpeace
proposals by Germay Is not likely to
effect the course of the war declared
the London Evening Star today in
the first nublished, comment on the
peace move of the Teutons.
British War Office Silent
By United? Press
LONDON, Dec. 12. The BritiifiTol
ieign office will make no statement
regarding Germany's peace proposals
until the terms are officially received
from Berlin and air the Allies' have
been consulted.
By handing the note to representa
tives of the United States, Spain and
Switzerland, Germany really transmit
ted it directly to her enemy nations.
Under exlsUng conditions this is the
only possible course of diplomatic In
terchange between the Central Powers
and the Entente Allies.
The procedure and transmission of
German's peace proposal wlllj.be Iden
tical in the case of all the - neutral
powers whose aid Is. invoked. The
diplomatic representatives of the Unit
ed States, Spain. and Switzerland will
forward the notes handed them- by von
Bethmann Hollweg .to their .respective
capitals. The foreign, office' or the
tate department of these nations will
then transmit the text to the Ameri
can. Spanish and Swiss ambassadors
or ministers at the capitals of the En
tente Allies. These ambassadors will
then, in turn, formally deliver these
notes to the governments of the-Entente
Allies.
The same procedure will be follow
ed in the case of formal replies to the
peace proposals.
A desire to smoke out the Allies to
announce what they are fighting for;
A desire to convince the world and
the German people everywhere that
Germany is not fighting a war of ter
ritorial conquest; a desire, if war con
tinues, to let the world Juiow that Ger
many will. not be responsible for furth
er bloodshed. " jr
The perice terms outlined, the Ger
man official Intimated, are not neces
sarily Germany's final proposal. "The
important question is to- find out
whether the Allies will talk peace,'
said this official. "Germany makes the
proposal inr-drder to find out whether
it may be more reasonable to stop
fighting before eltherj-.pid.e is able to
get what Lloyd-George called in his
interview with the United Press some
time" ago.knocked out!."
t t
Peace Terms Are Outlined.
By United Press ,
WASHINGTON, Dec 12. Germany's
peace proposals, according to the Ger
man embassy officials, will include a
suggestion that the territorial status
of the nations engaged' be returned
"practically" to what It was before the
war started, with the exception of the
establishment of the Independence of
Poland and Lithuinia and some read
justments of international boundar
ies in the Balkans.
On this last quesUon, it is said, the
situation is so complicated that it is
hard at this time to suggest definitely
anything like possible terms that will
he accepted by all belligerents. The
concrete suggestion is that Bulgaria
probably will want the, return of ter
ritory that she lost in the Second Bal
kanWar, and It is supposed Germany
guaranteed this when Czar Ferdinand
cast his lot with the Central Powers.
The peace terms, the United Press
informant said, include the evacuation
of northern France, restoration of
Belgium, of Serbia' and of Rumania,
and the return to Germany of her "ost
colonies. The factors which are. said
to have led to Germany's peace pro
posal are; ,
The favorable military position of
the Central Powers; ,
The fact that the winter at hand
wlil necessitate cessaUon of hard.
By United Press
BERLIN, Dec 12. Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg did not state any
definite peace terms in his speech be
fore the Reichstag. Immediately after
hearing the Chancellor's speech, the
ReichstagT'adJourned -pending the call

U. 8. to TrtMmlt' Proposals.
By 'CARL". GROAT '
,. (United Press Staat"CorresnondeoO
WASHINGTON, Dec 12. If Ger
many's 'peace proposals suggest that
she merely wishes the United States
to act as a courier in transmitting
them, this government will pass them
along, but If Germany's proposals be
that the United States itself, along
with other neutral nations, shall make
the proposals in her own name, on
Germany's behalf, the Administration
will study the situation before taking
action. . '
This does not mean, however, that
the United 8tates would not transmit
the proposal under the second plan.
Official at the State Department re
vealed these facts shortly after Secre
tary Lansing was shown the German
dispatches to the United States from
Berlin awing that. Germany had ini
tiated a peace move. In the absence
of exact information,. Secretary Lans
ing withheld cGameut He would not

By United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec p. There ill
little reason to doubt that the United
States would fall to act as intermedi
ary in bringing peace in the European
War unless she had indications that
such a move would not be scorned by
the Allies.
Germany's note should reach the
State Department in the ortlaary
course of events bv Friday. Such, an
.important document would doubtless
be forwarded by Secretary Grew with
all possible haste in plain language in
stead of code in as much as Germany's
proposals will not be new.
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg's
statement to the Reichstag, as Issued
to the newspapers follows: (
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
this afternoon, announced in tie
Reichstag that Germany, together. VHh
ner allies, conscious i ueir responsi
bility before God, their own nations
and humanity, "had 'proposed this
morning to the hostile powers that
they would enter into peace negotia
tions. ,
Practically all the members of par
liament appeared for the session.
Crowded galleries listened when1 the
Chancellor rose and, after outlining
the political situation and dwelling .up
on the achievements of the Central
Powers, made the announcement that
they will probably act as a turning
point in the war that for two years
has held (he world under Its spell.
''The Chancellor said it was fortun
ate that the Reichstag had not been
adjourned, but that the calling of the
next meeting was left to the discretion
of the president.' This' decision, said
the Chancellor, was caused by the hope
that soon happy events in the field
would be recorded. That hope has
been fulfilled quicker than was expected.
