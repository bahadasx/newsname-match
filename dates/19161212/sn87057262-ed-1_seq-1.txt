VON MACKENSEN'S HEADQUAR
TERS, Dec. 12.—(By courier to Ber
lin and wireless to The United Press,
Dec. 12.)—Germany's campaign in Ru
mania has only started. Every Ger
man soldier is fitted with snow shoes
for the winter campaign—and all
wagons are so devwed that they can
foe transformed into sleds. Favored
by ideal weather, the forces of Field
Marshal Von Mackensen and General
Von Falkenhayn have acquired such
momentum with the fall of Bucharest,
that they will surge on farther Ihto
Rumania. Field Marshal Von Mack
ensen, by Bucharest's fall, is in a
position to swing masses of men and
artillery north, south, east and west,
with clear lines of communication.
The complete demoralization of the
Rumanian forces has permitted Von
Mackensen's troops to advance with
insignificant losses.
As General Von Kluck once de
clared in an interview for the United
Press: "One cannot postpone the op
portunity to fight, if one expects to
win the battle" and it is on this theory
that Von Mackensen is operating In
Rumania. There is every indication
that the Russians will have to fight
for their lives this winter—instead of
next spring, as General Brusiloff has
declared.
For the first time since Belgium
was crossed, newspaper correspond
ents were permitted to follow the Ger
man army without^ restrictions, al
lowed permission to live with the
troops and to watch bombardments.
Apparently acting under the influ
ence of Russia, the retreating Rumani
ans attempted to burn all cities and
villages which they evacuated, but the
German advance was so swift In man}

WASHINGTON, Dec. 12. Ger
many's peace proposals, according to
a German embassy official, will in
clude a suggestion that the territorial
status of the nations engaged, be
returned "practically" to what it was
before the war started.
The .exemptions are establishment
of independent kingdoms of Poland
and' Lithuania and some readjustment
of international .boundaries in the
B&lk&us
On the latter question. It was Bald,
the situation Is so complicated, it is
hard at this time definitely to sug
gest anything like positive terms that
will be accepted by all belligerents.
The one concrete suggestion made,
is that Bulgaria probably will want
the return of the territory she lost
in the second Balkan war and it is
supposed Germany guaranteed this
when Czar Ferdinand cast his lot
with the central powers.
The peace terms, the United Press
informant said, include the evacua
tion of northern France, restoration
of the kingdom iof Belgium, at least a
partial restoration of Serbia and Ru
mania, and the return to Germany of
her lost colonies.
The factors which are said to have
led to the German peace proposals
at this time are:
The favorable military position of
the central poiwers.
The fact that the winter at hand
will necessitate cessation of hard
fighting for three months.
A desire to "smoke out" the allies
to announce just what ^.hey are fight
ing for.
Desire to convince the world and
the German people wherever they are,
that Germany is not fighting a war
of territorial conquest, and
Desire, if war continues, to let the
world know Germany will not be re
sponsible for further bloodshed.
The peace terms outline^, the Ger
man official intimated, are not neces
sarily Germany's final proposition.
"The important question is to find
out whether the allies will talk
peace," said this official.
"Germany makes the proposal in
order to find out whether it may be
more reasonable to stop the fighting
before eltW?r ?ide Is able to get in
what LloydrGeorge called, in his In
terview with the United Press some
days ago, "a knockout."
Although he has no appointment,
it is expected Ambassador Von Berns
torff will see Secretary I^anstag and
thoroughly discuss with him the
whole matter. It is believed pos
sible VonBernstorff may shortly ex
press a desire for an audience with
President Wilson.
The peace conference if it comes,
probably will be held either at Berne
or at The Hague, it wa3 predicted.
