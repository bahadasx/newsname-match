elected to a public office, assumed
her duties as justice of the peace to
day. FEDERAL PROBE GOING
DEEPER INTO PAPER CASE
(By United Press)
Washington, Dec. 12.Whether
there is a conspiracy among paper
manufacturers to boost prices was,
to be probed by the Federal Trade
commission here today.
Manufacturers, jobbers, newspaper
publishers and others interested are
here from many parts of the country
for the hearing and some of them
will testify.
That the investigation today will
have to do with the alleged combina
tion to boost prices is indicated, it
is thought, by the presence of rep
resentatives of the American News
paper Publishers' association, which
made the original charge that high
paper prices were due to a manufac
turers' combination.
Investigators who have been at
work during the months since the
charge was made are ready to report
and may be put on the S'tand today,
it is expected. Members of the com
mission were exceedingly reluctant
to discuss possible developments at
the present hearing, saying only that
"the hearing will develop along def
inite lines to establish certain facta"

REPORT IS DENIED

ports that General Carranza, first

SIXTY PER CENT OF GUARDS
ON BORDER NOT TRAINED
Washington, Dec. 12.The atten

Clark, in response to a house resolu
tion, that 71,834 out of the grand
total of 163,800 national guardsmen
taken into the federal service up to
August 31, were without previous
military training. Rejections of en
rolled guardsmen for various causes
operated later to increase the num
ber of untrained" men to approxi
mately sixty per cent of the force.
HAYNER TURNS INVENTOR

Enemies of Germany to Receive Pro
posals Through Medium of
Neutral Powers.
Washington, Dec. 12.Ger-
many's peace proposals, accord
ing to a German embassy official,
will include the suggestion that
all the territorial status of the
nations engaged in war be re
turned to what it was before the
war was started.
(By United Press)
Berlin, Dec. 12.Germany and her
allied powers have proposed to enter
irfto peace negotiations. Proposals of
peace offers are contained in notes
handed to representatives of Germany
in belligerent countries*.
Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg to
day called representatives of the
United States, Spain and Switzerland
to his office and handed them the
note. The full text of the note will
be read at the Reichstag today.
The chancellor asked that the neut
ral nations which represent Germany
and her allied powers at the Ncapitols
of the nations at war, bring these pro
posals to the attention of Germany's
enemies.
By handing the note to representa
tives of the United States*, Spain and
Switzerland, Germany has really
transmitted it directly to the enemy
countries. Under existing conditions
this is the only possible course for
diplomatic interchange between the
central powers and the entente al
lies.
The diplomatic representatives of
the United States, Spain and Swit
zerland forwarded the note handed
them by Hollweg to the respective
capitols. The foreign office will
transmit the text to the representa
tives at the capitols of the entente al
lies.
The same procedure will follow
with the replies to the peace propo
sition. England, for instance, will
probably give the American and Span
ish ambassador and the Swiss min
ister identical notes detailing its re
sponse to Germany's proposals. The
answer will be transmitted to the
United States, Spain and. Switzerland
through diplomatic channels and will
be handed to Germany through repre
sentatives at Berlin.
English Coast Raided.
London, Dec. 12.A man and wo
man were killed and 37 were injured
in the German air raid on the Eng
lish coast Nov. 27. In this raid Brit
ish flyers bagger two Zeppelins.
18 Killed in Riot.
Amsterdam, Dec. 12.The killing
of 16 Belgians in a riot at Turcoing,
Belgium, due to German deportation
was reported today by the newspaper,
Echo de Beige. According to the
report, a German soldier struck a
Belgian with the butt of a gun. The
soldier was attacked by a crowd and
German troops in charge of the de
portation attacked the crowd. -Fifty
Belgians were arrested.
Fight to Finish.
Paris, Dec. 12.France's recon
struction cabinet has been designed
to carry on the war with a re
doubled vigor. The cabinet is being
completed by Premier. Briand.
New blood for old, economy and
efficiency is what Premier Briand is
aiming at in the reconstruction.
The public believes that General
Joffre will go. Joffre was once an
idol of the country but it is believed
that he will be transferred from ac
tive command to probably the head
of the war counsel of the ministry.
General Petain, the defender of Ver
dun, will probably be his successor.
The members of the new cabinet
will be probably be announced late
today.
Soldiers are Notified.
Berlin, Dec. 12.The kaiser today
notified the troops in the field of the
peace proposal message. In a state
ment he said, "Soldiers, in agree
ment with the sovereigns of my al
lies, and with the consciousness of
victory, I have made an offer of peace
to the enemy."
