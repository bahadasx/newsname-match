WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 A Ger
man embassy official said the peace
terms Included the restoration of the
territorial status existing before the
war, the establishment of the Inde
pendent Kingdoms of Poland anl
Lithuania, and some readjustment of
the Balkan International boundaries.
Bulgaria wants the restoration of the
territory lost In the second Balkan
war. Germany offers to evacuate
northern France and Belgium and
partially restore Serbia and Rouman
ia, provided the allies return the hot
colonies.
The United Press Informant said
the following factors had caused the
proposal. The central powers are now
in a fwvorable military position. Win
ter will necessitate a three month
lull. They desire to smoke out the
allies and ascertain their exact ob
jectives. They desire to convince the
world that Germany is not fighting a
war of conquest. They desire to show
the world that Germany is not respon
sible for further bloodshed. The offi
cial said the terms were not necessar
ily Germany's final proposition.
"An Important question to ascertain
U whether the allies are willing to
talk peace Germany makes the pro
posal to ascertain whether either side
should stop fighting before a knock
out is scored."
Bernstorff expected to see Lansing
and thoroughly discuss the whole
matter. It is believed Bernstorff may
geek an audiPnce with President Wil

the time was opportune.

GERMANY'S PEACE
PROPOSALS IDE
WHILE UNBEATEN
Teuton Occupy Probably the Highest
Ioiat They Will 1 teach Would
Re Greatly to Advantage to Sc.
inre Peace Now.
(By J. W. T. Mason. Written for the
United Press.)
NEW YORK. Dec. 12.-Germany'
peace proposals are made when her
armies are on the offensive In the
newest battle area, and the western
front Is again deadlocked. Germany
wants peace with the Teutonic troop
occupying the enemy territory on
practically every front.
Germany's position Is not a beaten
one. The Teutons occupy probably
the highest position they'll reach.
They have a clear road In Asia Minor,
halting every movement to break tho
Oermnn defenses.. It would be great
ly to Germany's advantage to get
peace now.
Nevertheless, Germany's man pow.
,er lefses are constantly greater. The
British government hag just under,
gone reconstruction for the purpose
of flsbting harder. France la evolv
ing greater efficiency schemes.
German militarists feel the war's
future developments cannot bring
better prospects.
Germany must nialte large conces
alnns to secure peace now. Whatevef
terms Hollfeg's first announcement
include may be altered during the ne.
gotlatlons. The most Impor'ant fncl
of Germany's attitude Is the definite,
statement of tentative terms, as a
ptinlng point for future e'ahornMnns
and poflble settlement.
