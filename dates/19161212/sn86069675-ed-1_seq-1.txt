Former Montgomery County Citizen
Dies at Bushton,' Illinois, Affer
Long Illness.
Relatives here were grieved to
lenrn thnt jrrs. John E. James, nged
G3, had died at her home in Bush
ton, 111. Thursday night, after- n
protraeted illness. Mrs. James w'as
formerly Miss Sarah Stephens, of
IhiS county, Dnt lias been living in
Illinois for nenrly a quarter of n
century. While she had been ill for
ninny years and fbr several months
past had been confined to her room
she was never heard to murmur or
complain and accepted her suffer
ings with lovely Christian fortitude.
She hud been a member of the
Christian church for many years
and was happiest when, doing pome
service for her Lord und Master.
Her sweet 'face made. sunshine, in
a shady place. If strangers felt
the fhtji-m of her rare courtnsy nnd
joyousj sunny temperament, how
much jninro so the member? of her
own household upon whom she lav
ished nil the sweet earnestness of
her mind und nature. Strong and
j potent was tho influence of this lov
ing heart which guvo'its gifts bo
generously. The spirit of her love
was not weakness but strength.
Gently, iilmost unconsciously, it co
creed those coming in contact with
it, to strive for if not to attain tho
realization of her high ideal. The
manner of her depnrturo was beau
tiful. After bidding- nil the loved
onos good-bye, with n message for
each, she relapsed into a slumnor
for n littlo while, nnd then opened
her' e.U's with n most heavenly ex
pression, as though sho had caught
n glimpse of the Pearly Gates- nnd
tho gold pavc,d streets of (he Now
Jerusalem.
Besides her husband she is sur
vived by two sous, Letcher, of
Georgetown, HI., and II. Q., of
Baiubridge, lad.; two daughters,
Mra. II. C. Turner, of Bainbridge,
Ind., uud Iiss "Fannie Junics, of
Bushton, 111. Her father, Mr, J. Q.
Stephens, aged 85, years, of this
city, two &istei, Mrs. John F. Rich
ardson, ulso .of this city, and Mrs,
Mnry Taylor," of Bushton,' 111., and
three brothers, Messrs. C. B. Steph
ens, of this pity; W. Q. Stephens,
