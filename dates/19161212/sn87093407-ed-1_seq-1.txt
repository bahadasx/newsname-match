EMBASSY DECLARES
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.—Germany**
peace proposal*, according to a German em
bassy official, will include a suggestion that
territorial status of the nations engaged be
returned "practically" to what it was before
the war started.
The exemptions are establishment of in
dependent kingdoms of Poland and Lithua
nia and some readjustment of international
boundaries in the Balkans.
On the latter question, it was said, the
situation is so complicated that it is hard at
this time definitely to suggest anything like
positive terms that would be accepted by all
belligerents.
The one concrete suggestion made is that
Bulgaria probably will want the return of
the territory she lost in the second Balkan
war, and it is supposed Germany guaranteed
this when Czar Ferdinand cast his lot with
the central powers.
The peace terms, the I'nlled
Press' Informant salt!. Include the
evacuation of Northern France. res
toration of the Kingdom of Bel
glum, nt least a partial restoration
..f Serbia and Rumania, and the re
turn to Germany of her lost colo
nies.
The factors which are said to
have led to the German peace pro
posals at this time are:
The favorable military posl
tion of the central powers.
The fact that the winter at
hand will necessitate cessa
tion of hard fighting for three
months.
A desire to "smoke out" the
allies to announce just what
they are fighting for.
Desire to convince the world
and the German people wher
ever they are that Germany Is
not fighting a war of territorial
conquest and—
Desire. If war continues, to
let the world know Germany
will not be responsible for fur
ther bloodshed.
The peace terms outlined, the
German official Intimated, are not
necessarily Germany's final pro
posal.
Want to Sound Allies
"The Important question is to
find out whether the allies will talk
peace," said the official.
"Germany makes the proposal In
