Generally the announcement was a :
istinct surprise throughout official |

One prevailing opinion was that the

loir peace offer at this time with ex- j
ectution of making terms which

crisis in Russia in which the
mma interferred to prevent negotiaons
of a separate peace with Gerany
was recalled as an indication
f what the German foreign office
light, hi looking forward to in peace j
cgotiations.
It has been generally acknowledged
i Entente allied circles that efforts ;
ould 1).' made by Germany to unhide
peace separately with her enetles
but so far all Entente tuitions
ave reiterated their intention to a<iore
to the agreement made early in
te war not to make separate peace.
The recent death of Austrian Km-,
eror Francis Joseph and the succesion
of King Charles to the throne of
to dual monarchy also was discussed
s one of consideration which might
ave been a factor in bringing out
oace proposals at this time.

the exception of the establishment of
and Lithuania.
They arc understood to propos
occupied portions of Belgium and Fr.
tured colonies and to dispose of the 1
tremely complicated nature in the Pea
powers. The Chancellor continued:
"On August 1. 1914. the Kmperor had I
personally to take the gravest elect- I
sion which ever tell to the lot ot a I
(ierman ? the order for nioblization
which he was compelled to give as a ,
result of the itiiasiun mobilization.
During these long and earnest
years of the war the emperor has
been moved by a single thought; how
peace could he restored, to safeguard
Germany after the struggle in which
he has fought victoriously.
"Nobody can testify better than I
j to this, who bear tho responsibility)
I for all action of the government." 1
In a deep moral and religius sense'
l of duty toward his nation and bevond 1
it. toward humanity the emperor now
considers that the moment has come
for official action toward peace.
"His majesty therefore in complete
harmony and in common with our al;
lies decided to propose to the hostile
powers to enter into peace negotiations.
"This morning I transmitted a note
to this effect to all the hostile powers
through the representatives of these
powers which are watching over our
interests and rights in hostile states.

I forward that note. The same procedure
has been adopted today in Vienna,

states and his Holiness the Pope
have been similarly informed."

Sight Cases Now Reported
and Preventative Steps '
(
are Taken. i
ij
Fearing a general epidemic ot {
neasles the health department of the
:lty today warned physicians, school
eachers and parents that all cases of
uspected measles must be promptly 1
eported so that an effective quarau-,1
ine can be established and every pos- '
ible measure taken so that the spread
if this troublesome malady can be ;
hecked. Seven cases on the East
iide and one at the White school have
ieen reported.
The start of the seven cases in the
Sast Side schools was traced to one
ihild that brought the diseases here :
rom Rosebud. A number of children ]
n the first and second grades at the 1
3ast Side school, who have been ex- 1
>osed to the infection, were sent home 11
ind all of the cases which have devel- j
iped are under rigid quarantine. City
'hyslcian Dr. M. Ramage was !;
ailed to confer with Supt. Hustead. ;
he regular medical inspector, Dr. ;
loyers, being confined to his home by 1
in illness of grippe.
Measles are more dreaded by the '
lity Health department than any oth- j1
r disease that affects the children ]
if the city since more deaths occurred ;
ast year from this malady and its '
.uiiipiiiaiiuua iuhu wuiii u jpuilltTlu, | '
carlet fever, cltickcnpox and infan- i'
ile paralysis all together. While the 1
iresent cases are of a mild type yet It
s feared th:^ unless the spread of the '
iresent epidemic is checked that it 1
vill develop iuto even a more virulent 1
ype than that of last winter. 1
No children were found at the White 1
ichool that had been exposed and wTTk
he exception of the child that is now '
11 with the malady the school at that,
ilace is being conducted as usual. The .
:hief reason that the spread of the epilemle
at this time is feared is that in 1
nany of the cases physicians have not '
ieen called and the parents thinking I
hat the child's Illness is not serious :
lo not report the case to the health department.
Parents however are required lo retort
this contagion whether or not a
h.vsician is called. The slightest redless
of the eyes, inflamatlou of the1
lose and throat or breaking out of the
kin is cause for antrm and the health
lepnrtment wishes all persons to reiort
such cases.

As soon as every good housewife in
the city stuck her head out of the

slammed and from then until
school time the poor children were
lectured on grippe, and keeping their
feet dry, and were finally started off
to school wrapped in shawls and blank

everything from overshoes to gum

The snow started at three minutes j
past eleven last night and in intermittent
flurries kept up until this
morning there was an inch and a half
or two inches of the "beautiful."
The temperature was at no time during
the day so cold as to be disagreeable,
hovering pretty closely about the

by the fact that hundreds of pairs of
