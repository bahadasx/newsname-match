if WALUCHM
HAS BEEN LOST
TO ROUMANIA
Nation's Richest Province in
Hands of Teutonic Invaders
BULGARS POURING OVER DANUBE
Mackensen Breaking Resistance of
Army He Crove Out of
Bucharest.
London, Dec. 11. Rumania's last
chance to save any of Wallachla, her
richest province, from the Teuton in
vaders has been lost, Hungarian and
German troops cut their way, this
afternoon across the River Jalomltsa,
the last natural barrier before Mol
davia is reached.
At the same time more Bulgarians
have poured across tho Danube,
crossed its marshes and taken tho
western end of the great Cernavoda
bridge, and further up strean. the
railhead of Calarasi. A third Bulcar
column has crosseed from Turtukai
toward Oltenltsa.
Again Von Mackensen is striking
at the flanks of the retreating Rus
sian and Rumanian army, the same
sure, swift blows that led to the fall
of Bucharest. Resistance is being
broken now in Great Wullachia. as it
was broken In Little Wallachia, and
thousands more prisoners have been
taken.
In the region where the Jalomitsa
has been crossed, northeast of Bu
charest, near Receanu. the Ruman
ians counter attacked on Sunday,
trying to stop the Teuton rush and
save the important city of Buzen, a
railroad junction and minor oil cen
ter, forty miles beyond Ploescl. At
first they had success, destroying
two squadrons and driving back the
Teutons some miles, a wireless mes
sage says. Berlin announces tonight
that the "rapid advance"" in Great
Walltchia continues. Today's German
statement said:
"Our pursuing armies at some
places encountered resistance, which
has been broken."
Russian attacks In the Carpathians
are kept up with great persistence,
all reports agree, but without appreci
able result. The Russians have now
to struggle through deep snow, and
in biting frost, besides encountering a
strong Teuton defence, they announce
Berlin says the Russian attacks are
strong.
While his armies are still in rout,
King Ferdinand is the center of great j
interest here. A despatch from
Amsterdam says the Rumanian ruler
has crossed the Danube to Renl, in
the Russian province of Bessarabia,
where he is to meet the Czar to mor
row. The despatch quotes Gennan
sources, which seem well Informed
of the progress of .events in Rumania.
The despatch says both monarchs
are accompanied by j'several minist
ers," though it was reported yester- j
day that all the Rumanian Ministry
except Premier Bratiano had resign-
ed. Conjecture is rife whether the
meeting portends any weakening of
Ferdinand's determination to con
tinue resistance or whether he is ask
ing more help from Russia.
TWO PERSONS KILLED
Man and Boy Crushed By Marble
Blocks.
Rutland, Dec. 12. The 10-year-old
son of Mr. and Mrs. Stanley LaGage
of West Rutland, was Instantly killed
and his body terribly crushed and
Patsy Dino, about 40 years old, an
employe of the Vermont Marble
company, received injuries from
which he died within a few minutes,
about 4.35 o'clock yesterday after
noon when a Delaware and Hudson
locomotive collided with a block of
marble swinging from a derrick at
the True Blue plant of the Vermont
Marble company at West Rutland.
! The engine, attached to two passen
ger coaches, was backing toward the
True Blue plant when workmen
swung the derrick, carrying a block
of marble weighing several tons, di
Tectly over the rails. Engineer H.
Seism was unable to stop his train
and the tender of the locomotive
struck the marble, splitting the block,
pieces falling on each Bide of the
track.
One piece fell upon the La Gago
boy and the other dropped upon Dino,
who was at work under the derrick.

HOLLAND APPEALS
TO U.S. TO SAVE
THE BELGIANS
Holland Section of Neutral League
Seeks Our Co-operation
PROTESTS COUM OF GERMANY
Appeal Insists Deportation is in Vio
lation of Hague Regulations of
1907.
London, Dec. 12. The Associated
Press has received at lxndon from
Amsterdam an "appeal to the Ameri
can people" by the Holland section
of the league of neutral states. The
appeal Is signed iy rresluent Nie
myer and Secretaries Deiaiaille and
Walch. It follows:
"Your president has said that soon
er or later a moment would come
when the war would make the posi
tion of neutral nations unbearable.
For us Hollanders that moment has
arrived; not through our own suffer
ings, but 'because we cannot longer
passively contemplate the ghastly
suffering Inflicted by Germany upon
I Belgium, our neighbor. ,
"The eloquent protests of the Bel
glan government and of the higher
clergy have acquainted you with the
facts. A glance at the section of the
Hague regulations of 1907, which
deals with the law of war on land,
will make it obvious to you that the
sole reason why the prohibition of
this modern slave dealing was not
included was because no delegate
imagined it could ever be necessary.
"Indeed, one must turn to the his
tory of the early ages of long past
centuries before international law ex
isted to find a parallel to the enslav
ing of the) Belgians. The Hague reg
ulations stipulate that 'the honor and
rights of the family must bo respect
ed,' but the German government de
liberately drags the Belgian families
apart. To us this cruelty is more
vivid every day. Every day mem
bers of fugitives in spile of the dead
ly electric wire which the Germans
have erected along the frontier, suc
ceed In escaping to the Netherlands.
From them we learn the painful de
tails of tho unutterable despair of tho
women and children who are left be
hind and of the agonizing scenes
which take place when husbands,
brothers and sons, dragged from their
homes and women folk, are packed
into cattle and freight cars und thus
transported slaves to an unknqwjnj
destination and to an unknown fate.
"To put an end to this to arrest
tills hellish scourge, which at this
moment lacerates the whole of north
ern France and western Russia
there is but one way open, and that
Is collective action on the part of tho
neutral nations.
"And for you, citizens of tho mighti
est of the neutral states, it is in our
opinion the right and duty to take the
leadership upon you. Only if you
place yourselves at our head can any
success crown our efforts. This tyran
ny Is not to 'be borne in patience and
the neutral nations ran no longer
stand Idly by while in western Eur
ope the most primitive laws of hu
manity, observed even by uncivilized
races, are trampled underfoot.
"We appeal to you to urge your
government to energetic and decisive
action and to call upon the other
neutral nations to rally around you.
That they will find faith and strength
in your leadership Is evidenced by the
stream of .messages expressive of
sympathy and a desire to co-operate
which have reached us from the mo
ment we published our intention to
make this appeal to tho American
people. We do not hesltato to take
it upon ourselves to speoq with firm
conviction in the name of humanity,
and our hope Is firmly fixed on that
sense of Justice which has always
formed one of tho most cherished
traditions of citizens of the United
States, Americans, we are convinced
that you will not disappoint our ex
pectations." LAND FLOWAGE CASE

Dr. Don D. Grout, superintendent of
the Vermont state hospital for the in
sane, has resigned his office, to take
effect Jan. 12, 1917. His letter to the
trustees follows herewith:
"You will recall that some six
months ago I offered my resignation
as superintendent of said hospital,
with the request that I be relieved of
my duties Aug. 1st. 1916.
"As a basis for this action I stated
that my health demanded a rest and
an opportunity to recuperate from the
physical condition made inevitable by
the arduous duties Incumbent upon
one in my pouitlon.
"Your reply was that you could not
consider my request, but that I was
authorized and requested to take such
rest and recreation as was necessary
to restore me to health.
"I have seen no opportunity, on ac
count of the necessary daily toil, care
and oversight, to take such a vacation,
nor can I see how it can be brought
about In the near future.
"Since 1 have been in charge here
have had only one vacation of two
weeks, at any one time, for the multi
plicity of duties would not permit it.
"Since Sept. 5th, 1905, I have carried
on the work devolving upon me to the
best of my ability, and I want to as
sure you and former members of your
board that 1 feel that I have had the
earnest and intelligent co-operation,
assistance and advice from you that
has enabled me to bear the burdens
and cares that necessarily have de
volved upon me. For this considera
tion and assistance I am very grate
ful, and wish you to understand that I
fully appreciate it.
"For nearly 45 years my shoulders
have been, almost daily, in my pro
fessional collar and nearly 16 of these
years have been occupied in the per
formance of my duties in connection
with the Vermont state hospital, as
one of the original trustees and as
superintendent.
' I askexl that I may be relieved of
my duties as superintendent January
1st, 1917, or as soon as you can ar
range, thereafter, matters so as to
enable me to do so.
"Thanking you for kindness, con
sideration and assistance."
The trustees of tho state hospital,
D. D. Burditt of Plttsrord. C. II. A.
Stafford of Morrlsville and N. D.
Phelps of Barre have accepted the
resignation in the ft. "'.owing letter:
"We sincerely regret hat the condi
tion of you health continues to be
such that you regard it necessary to
sever your connection with the hospi
tal. "In accepting your resignation as su
perintendent we desire to express our
appreciation of the long and faithful
service rendered; your successful ad
ministration as such; and to commend
you therefor.
"Wishing you a speedy return to
health."

GERMANY ADMltS'VERDUOEFENDER
HO WARNING WAS
GIVEN MARINA
Washington Officials Claim Viola
tion of Berlin's Pledges
SIX AMERICAN LIVES LOST.
Kaiser's Government States Sub-
marine Commander Mistook
Vessel for Transport.
Washington, Dec. 12. Information
assembled at the state department
believed by some officials to present
a clear-cut violation of German
pledges In the sinking of the British
steamer Marina with tho loss of six
American lives, has been forwarded
to Berlin for submission to the Ger
man foreign office. It was an
nounced at the department yesterday
, that the evidence had been sent as a
I matter of courtesy, to allow the Im
perial government to offer any other
facts it may have before the United
States takes its next step. Officials
indicated also that any move by this
government might be delayed until
complete Information concerning the
British liner Arabia for which Greiat
Britain has been asked could be sent
to Berlin.
In response to inquiries, Germany
has admitted the torpedoing without
warning of both the Marina and Ara
bia, stating that her submarine com
manders took them for transports
and asking the United States to fur
nish any evidence It might have to
tho contrary. In the case of the
Arabia, Great Britain has been re
quested to furnish official data to
establish whether the Peninsular and
Oriental liner was in government ser
vice, although all information now at
hand . indicates that when sent down
she was passing through the Mediter
ranean on a regular voyage with pas
sengers and freight. 1
As to the Marina, officials regard
the case as complete. According to
I tho evidence, while carrying a cargo
of horses and other freight, sho was
torpeMoed and sunk without warning
. 100 miles from shore in a high sea.
. with no provision for the safety of
hoso on board. Many horse tenders,
including six Americans, were lost. In
vestigation has developed, It is Bald,
thut tho ship had not been under
charter or requisition by the British
government during the war, but had
tiansported horses at so much per
head for the allies.'
It is generally believed that when
President Wilson and Secretary Lan
sing are ready to act tho next steps
will taken the form of a communica
tion to clear up any doubt that may
exist at Berlin as to the interpreta
tion given by the American govern
ment to the German pledges given
after tho attack on tho Sussex.
As in the Sussex catastrophe, offi
cials at Washington point out that
the Marina and Arabia cases have
demonstrated tho menace to innocent
neutral lives In the practice fre
quently followed by German sub
marine commanders of attempting to '
ascertain the character of a ship by
poriscope observations. The United
States has demanded that the char
acter of a vessel be determined be
yond doubt before an attack Is made
that endangers the lives of its citzens
and contends that this can be done
practically only by actual visit and
search.

meantime, according to the Paris
Matin the reorganization of the high

esbcntially administrative question,
will not be settled until after the new

Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday and
is indorsed by a vote of confidence.
"In addition to forming a war

the Matin. "Premier Briand has de

OTHERS SHOP EARLY
But Not Myself, Says Every Woman,'
According to Store Manager.
Every woman seems to think that
every other woman, and not she her- ,
self ought to do her Christmas shop-'- 1
ping early. In recent years newspa- .
pers have printed column after coJ-;
umn urging the shoppers to get their
holiday purchasing done as early In
tho Christmas season as possible and.
so help relieve the congestion in tho
stores during the week before Christ
mas. They have pointed out bow greatly
early shopping would , help the tired
out salespeople and dollvery men and
how generally advantageous early
purchasing would be. Various associ
ations and clubs composed of promi
nent women. have sponsored the early
shopping idea and have done all they
could to further it. The department
stores themselves have advertised
and done all they could in order to
induce earlier purchasing in tho holl-' i
day season. ' "Jl
But, according to the head of ono '
of New York's biggest retail stores, W
these efforts havo proved practically
useless for the reason cited sbove.
namely, that every woman . thinks ;'
that the exhortation to shop early forf'
Christmas ; should in all fairness,, ap-. .-'
ply to every woman but herself.1.
Incidentally, this department store : i.
man said, that if the women ; only
could be convinced of the assistance
they could give to tho stores not only.1,;
by shopping early in the season but ' i
earlier In tho morning than is now
tho case, the lives of tho department
store executives, salespeople, jiackers
and delivery men would be made de
cidedly more worth living.
Ho pointed out that the big stores
in New York do nlno hours' work in
about five hours. There Is practically
no great amount of business prior to
11.30 in tho morning. On the other
hand, there is a rush from that time
no until 5.30 at night, at which hour
most of the stores close now. New
