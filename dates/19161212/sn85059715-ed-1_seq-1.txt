from Berlin to the German embassy
indicate that Germany's peace terms
in general measure propose the restoration
of the status quo before the
war with the exception of the establishment
of independent kingdoms of
Iceland and Lithuania.
They are understood to propose
the complete restoration ot" the occupied
portions of Belgium and France
in return for Geiniaay's captured
colonies and to dispose ol 11k- Balkan

complicated nature in the peace conference.
REICHSTAG IS TOLD
OF THE PEACE OFFER
far ASSOCIATED
LONDON, Dec. 12? A i ireiess despatch
from Berlin says that in his
speech before the Reichstag Tuesday,
Chancellor von Bethxnann-Hollweg announced
that Germany, together with,
its allies, "conscious of their responsibility
before God. before their own nations
and before humanity." have proposed
to the hostile powers to enter
into peace negotiations.
WILSON INTERESTED
IN TEUTONIC ACTION
far as&oc i at to sscts)
? WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.?News
that Germany and its allies were
about to enter on peace negotiations
was immediately sent to President
"Wilson. Speaking for the president.
Secretary Tumulty said he was deeply
interested but could make no comment,
at least until it was learned
what reception the proposal received
from the Entente Allies.
The state department received its
first information of Germany's proposal
through the Associated Press
despatches from which officials assumed
that the offices or the neutrals
addressed are asked only to
transmit the proposals. This will be
done so far as the United States is
concerned promptly on receipt of the
official despatches in Washington.
They will be forwarded to all the Entente
countries where the United
States represents the Central powers
diplomatically.
Whether the United States would accompany
the transmission with any
comment or suggestion, it was indicated.
depends entirely upon the nature
of the proposal and whether it is
considered likely of consideration. If
the offer Is deemed one on which all
sides might agree the United States
probably would urge that It be taken
up.
1 nthe transmitting of the proposals,
it was officially stated, the United
States probably would follow the practice
which has been invariable so far
as acting as a medium of communication
between the hostile governments
and would not make them public. The
terms would, of course, be known to
President Wilson and Secretary Lansing
would examine them to determine
whether they should be accompanied
by any word from the United States.
The news was practically the only
topic of discussion among the membersof
Congress as they assembled for J
the day's session. A regular cabinet
meeting was scheduled for this afternoon
at the White House and there was
no doubt it would be discussed there.
The foreign embassies received their
first information of the event through
Associated Press despatches. On every
hand the discussion turned to what
had moved Germany and its allies to
make their proposals at this time. Although
for many weeks there have
been persistent and officially denied reI
ports that some peace proposal was
about to be made by President Wilson
there was no open indication that the
Central pow.ers themselves were about
to make one. Generally the announcement
was a distinct surprise through
official and dln'nmatic circles.
~ **. *? *
one prevailing opinion iu?i. <
the Germanic allies hail brought!
about their peace offer at this time;
-with, the expectation of making terms
which might be acceptable to the allies
of England and in effect might
possibly cause the British; government j
to yield to the pressure of the nations
fighting with it. In this connection
the recent crl-is in Russia, in which
the Duma interfered to prevent the
negotiations of a sen-rate poac with
Germany, was recR'""! as an indication
of what the German fore5en office
might be looking forward to in
peace negotiations. It has been generally
acknowledged in Entente Allied,
circles that efforts would be
made by Germany to conclude peace
separately with its enemies but so far
all the Entente nations have reiterated
their intentions to adhere.to their
agreement made early in the war not
to make a separate peace. The recent
death of the Austrian' emperor,
^'raacis Joseph, and the succession

As a parliamentarian, backers of

iarrison county senator is peculiarly
tted for the position.
Although the "baby" member of

wisdom in deaMng with legislative
latters that marked him as one of
he Republican leaders in that body.
Friends of Mr. Parrish over the

He is one of the ten hold-over

. jury dismissed a warrant chargingi
oseph Donocure, an Italian, of Glen j:
21k No. 2, with violating the prohidtion
law.
Bonocure was arrested several days
igo by Special Offlcer John S. Slers
m a warrant sworn out by Slers after
ie had trapped Bonocure by having
mother man purchase a pint of whlscey
from Bonocure and paying for it
vith a marked dollar bill furnished
lim by the officer, the prosecution
intended.,
According to testimony produced
it the trial Monday evening Offlcer
hers marked a one dollar bill, gave
t to a fellow and sent him to Bonoure's
home to buy a pint of whiskey,
n a short time the fellow returned
vith the whiskey. When Bonocure
vas arrested he had the marked bill j
l 18 anegea, ana it appearea mat
he case was complete against him. ?
The officers were very much surirlsed,
however, when the Jury ren[ered
its verdict of not guilty. It is
inderstood that from the first five
if the jurors who were well known 1
msiness men were in favor of disnissing
the warrant and that the 1
ixth member of the jury, a young '
nan, agreed with his elders in a few :
ninutes. ,
The verdict of the jury expresses J
he opinion of most of the liberal- *
oinded persons of the city who have
teen opposed to Pindley's methods of
rapping men in this manner during '
lis administration which they clearly '
howed on November 7.
