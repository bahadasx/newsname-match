SO SAYS UNCLE FALSTAFF
Lieut. Jennings Undergoes Operation
—Company Hoping for
Home Orders.
mm
•m
Brownsville, Dec.. 3.—Although
the story has. so often been told of
the happenings on the 'border, your
uncle Falstaft has received a number
of cards and letters from Hamilton
county people, expressing apprecia
tion, so we will take another shot at
a letter to the Freeman-Tribune.
An item that will interest a num
ber of readers occurred yesterday
when six of we soldiers went into a
cafe, down town, and ordered each
a glass of milk. While we were
waiting for our order, we, naturally,
took a glance at the scenery in the
room. We found that besides our
party of six, there were three ladies
and a boy about fourteen years of
age Beated at one table. At table
number two, three ladies were con
gregated at table number three, two
ladles were busy. And the odd part
of the story is that of the fifteen
occupants of the cafe, eight of them
were ladies, and all but two of them
were drinking beer. The two were
drinking coffee—-and six immoral,
degraded, unsaved soldiers were
drinking milk. We'll admit that in
the saloon across the way, one
would find more soldiers at the bar
than one would fin&Jadies, but the
cafe was a. pu'blic place and to us the
thought of watching'supposedly re
spectable women, drinking in pub
lic, did not set well on otir appetites.
Didn't look like they were setting a
good example for a bunch of "young,
unsophisticated and virtuous" sold
iers.
Lieutenant Jennings underwent
"an operation at the local hospital
Friday a small tumor being remov
ed from his chin. He did not take
an anesthetic, (if that word is spell
ed right, it is a* mistake) but had
Captain Martin stand in front of
him while the surgeon wielded the
corn knife. One narcotic counter
acts another and Lieutenant Jen*
nings said he could not tell just
which hurt the worse—the slashing
of the surgeon or watching the facial
gyrations of Captain Martin conse
quently he was able to withstand the
operation without taking a sleep
producer.
Lieutenant Soderholm, who has
been assigned to the regular army
since arriving here, comes over ev
ery once in a while to see the Iowa
officers and if it were not strictly
against military rules, would be
gab-festing with the enlisted men.
Col. Hyatt, who has been confined
in the base hospital for several days
with a fever, is getting along nicely
and will undoubtedly1 be back at his
post within the week.
Just got word that Lieutenant
Soderholm had served his time with
the regulars and was back with
company to stay. Bet Captain Mar
tin and Lieutenant Jennings will
make bim do all the work—to make
up for time he bas been absent.
Mrs. Bert Barnett and baby ar
rived here Wednesday night and it
is getting to be a hobby with Bert
to
Bee
Ik
how good he can be. Mrs.
Barnett bas been unable to deter
mine which she loves the better,
Texas or her husband—that is, we
are quite positive that is the case.
Bert buys malted milk now instead
of—of—well, instead of cigarettes.
Major JepBon, who has command
el the 2nd Iowa Hospital Corps, en
gineered the dishing out of quinine
and other pills, and has ruled with
a kindly disposition during his
sleeping hours, has resigned and
gone to his home at Sioux City to re
sume his practice of surgery. He
gave\Us all some kindly advice about
"sticking to the grand old flag," but
his own lingers slipped.
The first Iowa and Battery ex
pect orders tomorrow to entrain for
Iowa within a very few days and we
Seconds are, of course, living in
hopes that it will be only a question
of 10 days or 2 weeks before we will
also hit the trail for Iowa. Howev
er, dame rumor has been very unre­
-v*
liable during the past two months
and when we see the First regiment
^getting aboard the cars, we will have
more confidence in the "home go
ing" story.
Guy Neddleton of the Hospital
Corps left yesterday for Sioux City
and his furlough states that he must
report to his commanding oflicer on
Christmas. He sure was praying
that the troops would receive the
call for home, before his furlough
expired.
Church services were held before
breakfast this morning. General
Allen done the talking and among
other things, told the boys that they
would not have much of any thing
to do this week but to enjoy them
selves, 'but advised them not to dis
sipate. Guess he didn't realize that
it had been almost a month since
we saw a pay day and that it costs
real money to dissipate in Texas.
Believe we forgot to mention
cranberry sauce and creamed peas in
our Thanksgiving menu. The boys
ate turkey 'till they gobbled, and
some of them are not yet in shape to
tackle another such feast*.
The boys\are still rehearsing for
the big Bungling Bros, show, but
the date has not yet been set.
L. L. Snyder, a brother of Paul V,
Snyder, assistant band leader of the
Second, has written a splendid
march and presented it to the Sec
ond Iowa Band. It sure is a hum
dinger and when we get 'back to
Webster City the band will prove to
you that Iowa has men who can
write music that is musical.
Most of the boys of company and
the band have begun to fatten up
in great shape and unless something
is done soon, they will not be in
good working condition when they
get home.
Captain Smith is kept busier than
a hen trying to scratch gravel out
of a "Webster City made" concrete
floor, but has slipped the hole in the
evener over about an inch, so Lieu
tenants Boudinot and Murphy have
to putt just a trifle harder. All of
them are looking healthy, however,
and the only real, reason they .have
to complain is that their clothes are
shrinking considerably.
Haven't seen where a special elec
tion has been called to determine
whether or not Webster City should
build a 1100,000 school house.
Keep one hand on your pocket
book—we'll soon be home—we hope.

DUS CKM EVE
Help Make the City a Blaze of Soft
Lights the Night Before
Christmas.
For two weeks before Christmas,
the down town streets will be a
blaze of glory with electricity. The
Christmas trees and the show win
dows will all be lighted and the
sight will bo the prettiest ever seen
in this town. People will come for
miles to see it, for nothing makes
that "Christmasy" feeling like a
lighted Christmas tree, and when we
will have not one—but dozens of
them—the picture will be worth
while aside from the commercial in
terest of the plan.
There is a second thought, howev
er, which is a delightful one. On
Sunday night, which will be Christ
mas eve, the load of .extra current
furnished for many of the business
houses, will be off the wires and the
residential portion may safely in
dulge in a lighting effect which will
•be beautiful. Let every resident turn
his porch light on and also light ev
ery room facing the street for at
least a portion of Christmas eve.
Lace curtains may be pushed back
and lighted candles placed in your
windows, that all who pass may
have a glimpse of the Christmas
cheer within. The old idea was that
on Christmas eve, the curtains should
be drawn aside and a bright light
placed in the window to light the
Christ-child through the snow. Now,
if never before, there is need for the
Christ-child to enter the homes of
Webster City and while the idea is
founded on legends, nevertheless
there is a vast amount of truth in
the real meaning.
Do not let a blind be drawn upon
Christmas eve in this city, and let
every light be turned on, with the
decorated Christmas trees and
wreathes -strongly in evidence.

Peter Hanson, an expert worker in
wood employed at present in the
£1OSZ,&. Upward sefte factory? last
week received news from Denmark
that he had just fallen heir to $16..
000 from his mother's estate. The
money came as well as the news, so
there is no doubt as to its authen
ticity.
Those who know Mr. Hanson are
congratulating him upon his good
fortune, concerning which he is most
modest. The recipient is unmarried,
is about 35 years of age and an in
dustrious and capable worker. He
is at present a boarder at the John
son House and has no future plans
except to continue at his work in
the seive factory. A sample of the
kind of work in wood of which Mr.
Hanson is capable, is found in the
interior woodwork at the First Na
tional Bank upon which he was em
ployed before he obtained work at
$6 per day at the Closz & Howard
seive factory.

SU6AR AND FLOUR
TAKE QUITE A DROP
A Break Made in the Fortifications
of Food Price Booster.—Car
Shortage Menace.
Sugar has dropped 50 cents on a
hundred pound sack during the last
ten days, according to Des Moines
wholesalers, and the price is expect
ed to drop lower providing the car
shortage does not interfere with dis
tribution. The jobbers say there is
plenty of sugar In the country. The
difficulty now is in getting it over
the railroads to the points of de
mand. The wholesale price now is
$7.50 for one hundred pounds.
Flour has dropped in price during
the last ten days also. The whole
sale rate on northern flour Saturday
was $9.50 a barrel. This is 80 cents
lower than the price ten days ago.
However, flour in the last few days
dropped to $9, but since has slightly
recovered.
The prices on other food products
have not changed in the last week.
Canned goods and other groceries re
main firm in price, wholesalers say.

THE PAST WEEK
First Time in Many Tears That
Ground has not been Frozen
in December.
It is not often that farmers in
Hamilton county can do plowing in
the month of December, but they
have been at it this month. The
ground froze to a depth of four or
five inches during the severe cold
spell of about six weeks ago. But
soon after that it warmed up and
during the past two or three weeks
many acres of Hamilton county soil
have been plowed. However, the
cold wave that struck us Friday
Is likely to put a stop to such opera
tions, but much time has been sav
ed in spring work. The corn pick
ing was finished early, owing to fav
orable weather, and considerable
land that was in corn has been plow
ed and is ready for spring seeding.

PIONEER DAYS RE
CALLED BY VISIT
Granddaughter of the First Settler
of Hamilton County is Now in
the City.
A most interesting circumstance
comes to light in the simple .chron
icling thatMrs.Emm&Strattan ot
Washta, Iowa, Is visiting her
friend, Mrs. Harriet Closz, in this
city. The viBit represents a friend
ship extending through three gener
ations and connecting the families of
the first settlers in Hamilton county
with the first settlers in Webster
City.
Major BTassfield was the first set
tler to arrive on the plot of land now
known as Hamilton county. Later
he and Wilson Brewer, the first set
tler to arrive in New Castle (Web
ster City), became fast friends. The
daughter of Wilson Brewer—Mrs.
Thos. Bonebright—was an intimate
friend of Major Brassfield's daughter
—Sevilla Wilson Brassfield, whose
middle name was for Wilson Brewer.
Still later down the line the grand
daughters of these first settlers have
been friends from young girlhood and
are now enjoying a visit together at
the home of Mrs. Closz on Bank
street.
RECEIVE BUTTONS
EOR PENMANSHIP
Pupils in High School get Mark of
Distinction From the Palmer
Company.
"Button, button, who's got the
button?" is the question nowa
days, and there are fifteen good an
swers to it, namely, Marie Schwandt,
Margaret Cheyne, Mary Breiten
kamp, Pearl Taylor, Horace El
wick, McKinley McCollough, Russell
Huff, Nellie Whlteman, Sabra Mark
wardt, Perry Johnson, Ray Daniels,
Leroy Boynton, Wayne Clement, Les
lie Calkins, Marion McPhillips. These
young people have completed twen
ty-five drills in the Palmer method
of penmanship and, having submit
ted them to the Palmer Company at
Cedar Rapids, have won these tokens
of recognition of the merit of their
\«ork. The value of the button is
slight, but the standard its wearer
must reach is high, and the fact that
there
haB
been no failure in all the
papers submitted, Bpeaks highly for
the enthusiasm with which Webster
City pupils are taking up this unus
ual opportunity. It also proves that
the unceasing and efficient direction
of Mr. Nelson Is able to produce re
sults that the most sanguine had not
expected.
This Bystem of penmanship is In
operation in many of the best and
largest schools of the United States.
It was originated by Prof. A. N. Pal-
The practice work consists of
drills which develop the free arm
movement, and demand tho utmost
jattention and continuous practice.
A half hour per day is the least that
|may be a'cceptcd as practice for Ted
jit., and the assiduity with which
jsome of the hertofore poor writers
ihave been applying themselves to
jthis work, has produced amazinp, re
suits. Beautiful penmanship is an
jart, none the less desirable than In
days gone by, even though the type
writer has done to penmanship what
the automobile has done to the
horse in industrial and economic
lines.
There has been a long felt want
in Webster City for the training of
tjie boys and girls to become legi
ble and artistic writers, hence the
school management looks with much
pride upon the fine array of new
Palmer buttons, of which the pos
sessors are as proud as though they
wore the Maltese Cross for valor.
Truly this is a case of valor
with the pen, which is mightier than
the sword, for behind, in the trench
es, lie the vanquished enemies—poor
curves, cramped movement, irregular
letters and unsightly errors In gen
eral.
.Stockholders, Meeting.
The annual meeting of the stock
holders of the First National Bank
of Webster City for the election of
directors for the ensuing year, will
be held at their banking house be
tween the hours of 1 p. m. and 3 p.

•CONTROVERSY
A6AIN ATJLLSWORTH
Annual Event now Being Staged in
the Metropolis of Lincoln
Township.
Times-Republican: Up at Ells
worth, Hamilton county, the annual
contest between those who would on
with the dance and those who would
put the reverse English on terpsich
orean Joy and instead of permitting
it to go at large and unconfined
would fit it with hobbles, is begin
ning to take on its winter activity.
The authorities of that town propose
a fat license fee for dances. Tho
dancing contingent revolts. And as
a result Ellsworth furnishes news
items of internecine combat between
those who would flirt the light fan
tastic toe and others who confine
the pedal extremities to purposes of
locomotion and purposeful transit
from" place to place in the pursuit of
business and duty rather than the
pursuit of fleeting happiness.
Seems liko some compromise
might be reached in the irrepressi
ble warfare. It may be possible to
abolish dancing, but so far efforts in
that direction have not been suc
cessful, so to speak. Something
about the lilt of a fiddle seems to set
the toes of common humanity wig
gling. It will be recalled that "the
wedding guest he beat his breast
when he heard the loud bassoon"
and he was grizzled and old and had
had a pretty hard time of it.
There should be some way of
splitting the difference at Ellsworth.
Dancing itself isn't a bad thing. It's
the way folks dance, the spirit they
dance in and the places where they
dance that make all the difference.
That some of the more modern
dances should shock the elders isn't
to be wondered at. Some of those
dances should be barred from public
exhibition. Especially so the way
some people dance them.
Ellsworth has its hands full in
the problem it is attempting to
solve. If it manages to find the so
lution it will go down in history
atoms with other great discoveries.

Young Couple Instantly Killed When
Train Hits Car in Which They
Were Riding.
A terrible automobile accident oc
curred at four o'clock Sunday af
ternoon in Eagle Grove, resulting in
instant death to Miss Kate Ballard
and Carl Keith, the sole occupants
of the car. A train struck the ma
chine on the Chicago & Great West
ern McVicker crossing, carrying tho
auto a-quarter of a mile. The sido
curtains of the ear were up, barring'
a good view o£ the crossing. Tho
bodies of both young people wero
badly mangled.
Mr. Keith anil Miss Ballard wero
both residents of Eagle Grove. The
former was a prominent jeweler and
the latter cashier in Baker's dry
goods store.
The young people were engaged to
be married and have many intimato
friends in this city who are shocked
and saddened by this frightful acci
dent. Miss Elsie Wickware, Miss
Mary Dundon, the Misses Greenwood,
Mrs. Mary Mickleson-Keith of Eagls
Grove, a former Webster City girl,
and many others here, were inti
mately acquainted with Miss Ballard
and her finance. The dead girl's
mother is a widow and is completely
prostrated by the terrible shock.
Of Interest to the Boys.
Most boys think Christmas is in
complete unless "Santa" leaves them
an addition to their Erector set—or
a whole new set. This famous con
struction toy, operated with an .elec
tric motor, is a wonderful contriv
ance to help the average boy de
velop his mind and ingenuity along
whatever Una b»«aay leaiw aueh« aa
structural engineering, mechanics,
architecture, electrical engineering,
etc. Aug. F. Mueller has a fine die
play o.f Erector sets in his show win
dow and before Christmas will have
a demonstrator here from the fact
ory to show our Webster City boys
the possibilities of these sets. Geo.
W. Steep, salesman in the Mueller
store, has built in the window a
large miner's elevator or hoist, a
double windmill, drill press, swing
ing saw and electrical transformer.
Theso things will be run by electric
motors from time to time and other
pieces made and added to the dis
play.
