NEW YORK, December 12
Overshadowing, all otlier
new oflii'ial and unofficial from
tin- war fronts is the report that
has seeped out of Paris that Gen
eral Joffrc is to be superseded by
General FetaiiJ, hero of the five
months of desperate fighting be
fore Verdun' and the man whose
'vivibr- Sfat? :Vver(fVe?pm!iibV:
lor the . success of the French ad
vance at the -Butte Tahure in
Champagne.
This reort, which has not been
officially confirmed, has been cir
i Hated from moufh to mouth in
Fnmcc for some time and reach
ed lure some days ago, unofficial
ly. Last night! private advices
from Paris to Washington went
far t confirm it.
. PETAIN COMMANDS
According to the report Pctaiti,
who for months has been with
General Jo IT re, the idol of the
French armies in the field and
the hero of the French people at
home, will immediately assume
command of the Allies on the
'western front.
Just what disposition will be
made of General JolTrc is not in
timated, although it is rumored
that his health has broken down
at last under the terrific strain of
two years of constant war, dur
ing which never for a moment has
the load of responsibility been
cased from his shoulders.
In this city there are not lack
ing those who sec a significance
in the breaking up of the British
cabinet under Asquith and the
change in the French command
at the front.
Military experts point out that
the methods which have been tried
bythe Joffre. regime at the front
and the Asqijith regime in politics
have failed and that now both
France and Britain are determin
ed to give other methods a trial.

Secretary Daniels appeared be- ' .
fore the house naval committee yes-
terday and argued thai a bill mak- ..'$
inii; the claim of the government to
preference in military and naval '. '
supplies binding by law instead of
merely a matter of choice on the
part of the manufacturer, become '
a part of the naval program to-be ,
adopted this winter.
The .secretary told the members
of the committee that unless some
such legislation as he advocates is ;
passed, lie fears that the construc
tion of the battleships authorized
by the last session of congress !., .
would be delayed indefinitely be
cause the yards of the nations are " r
choked with orders for private
work. 1 .
This is also true of the steel . .
plants. Some of the largest of the
last named, he declared are work
ing three shifts of men a day and ,, '
will not be able to catch up with
their contracts for two years. ' .,
