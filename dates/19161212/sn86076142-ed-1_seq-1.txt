BERLIN. Dec. 12 The deportation
answer expresses regret that the
United States never has seen fit to
protest against what It describes as
dragging off of Germans from east
Prussia, Alsuce and other plares to

Germany's snswer to the American

was urgent need of some kind of

( Br Associates Press.)
NEW YORK, Dec. 12. Regulation
of wages by, the same commission
that regulates rates may be the ulti
mate solution of -the railroad wage
problem, according to Ellsha Lee,
chairman of the national conference
committee of the railways, who ad
dressed the Economic club here last
night on the question: "Should the
right of public service employes to
strike be regulated by law 7"
"I am not prepared to say that all
wage problems of the railroads should
be placed unreservedly In the control
of a public commission," said Mr.
Lee. "But I do believe that when a
controversy between the manage
ments and the men reaches a stage
where the Interests of the public are
imperiled that then there should be
a compulsory peaceful settlement, a
judicial settlement, that will con
serve the public interest as well as
the rights of the parties to the con
troversy. If any body pf men are re
quired in the public Interest to subor
dinate their private rights to their
public duties. It should be with the
full understanding that their right
must be Id every way sfiarded
by the public.
"We are at the parting of the ways.
One road before us is a continuation
of the system of unrestricted private
wage bargaining ' that eventually
leads to settlement by force. The
other road is a restriction and regu
latloa of private wag bargaining for
the protect toa of the rights of the
public trial by jury. Instead of trial
by brutal force.
"No matter what remedy Is finally
adopted by congress for safeguarding
the nation against the sudden inter
