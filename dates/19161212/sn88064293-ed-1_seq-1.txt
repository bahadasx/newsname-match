WASHER WOMAN VICTIM OF FUMES
Hattie Williams Clothas Become Ignited. She Becomes
Crazy and Fights Her Rescuers. Doctors Horry to
Scene But Can Give No Relief. She Will Die.
Harriet Williams, colored aged about 45, was fatally burned shortly
afternoon today at the home of Jack Boudier on the south side of the S.
P. tracks, two doors east of Third St. The woman doing the family wash
ing, and while working around the wash boiler, her clothes became
ignited, however, she did not discover the fact that she was burning for a
few moments, and when she did learn that she was afire, the flames had
gained such headway that it was impossible for her to help herself. In
response to her frantic cries for assistance, Mrs. Jack Boudier went to her
aid. She tried to smother the flames,'but by this time the burning woman
was so crazed that she fought her rescuer thus giving the flames more
time to get in the deadly work.
Mrs. Boudier went to the house to get a blanket to try to cover the
flames, but the burning woman continued to fight Mrs. Boudier and Mrs.
George Grevemberg who had joined Mrs. Boudier in the fight, that it was
impossible for them to render much assistance.
Both of Mrs. Boudier's hands were so badly burned while trying to save
the woman's life, that her physician ordered her to bed. However she was
sitting up when a reporter for the Review called at her home to learn the
details, and in giving her information she said that too much praise could
not be given to Drs. Berwick and deGravelles for the prompt assistance
which they gave the burned woman in an attempt to save her life. However,
the physicians found that she was past all human aid, but as a last measure
it was decided to send her to the hospital in New Orleans, and she watt
removed to the station for this purpose, but when her relatives learned
that there was no hope for her, they decided that she should not be taken
away, and she was then removed to her home on the edge of town.
She was burned almost beyond recognition and it was only a question
of a few hours until she will be relieved by death.
She is a widow and has several children. She has a good reputation and
did washing for a number of the best families in the city. It was said she
took out a policy in an insurance company just a week ago.
DOLL AND TOY FUND NEFDS SIYTY-FIVE
DOLLARS 10 COMPLETE TOE WORK
Two Hundred Doiiiirs ore Needed To tail All The Kiddies
Only four Days Demain. Fund Will fisse Saturday.
Four days, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday and Saturday are all that are
left for the Review Doll and Toy
Fund to be distributed by the King's
Daughters. Of course there will be a
fund next year and in other years to
be, but the one most important is
right now. Its mighty hard to satisfy
a kids faith in Santa Claus with
promises of next year. He wants
something that he can realize on
right jxow. He knows that he has a
right to expect that Santa will re
member him, as well as you and I.
A wireless message from the old
genleman himself says that he is
going to need some help this year,
that the high coäs of presents has
made such a drain on his resources,
that ere he reaches Morgan City, his
pocket book wil be pretty well flat
tened out. He says that he wants you
and I to help, and promises that we
will be amply repaid in the satisfac
tion we feel on Christmas day.
The Evangeline benefit proceeds I
added $15,00 to the fund The
Methodist Sunday School generously
donated its collection of five dollars.
Three little A's gave one dollar and
two little J's contributed fifty cents.
Everybody is doing it in the last
days of the fund, and we dont think
we will be disappointed on counting
on you for your help.
All funds contributed to The Re
view Doll and Toy Fund will be dis
bursed by The King's Daughters of
this city. The Peoples State and Sav
ings Bank is the place of deposit for
the Fund but contributions will be
accepted by the banks of Morgan
City and by a number of the busi
ness men. Be certaih that your name
and the correct amount you contri
bute appear in the colums of this
