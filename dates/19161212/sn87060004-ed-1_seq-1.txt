FREE CLINIC
GREATSIICCESS
IFifty-four Trachoma Cases
Operated Some of Years
Standing
JQVER TWO HUNDRED
CASES WERE EXAMINED
Health League Workers arc
Greatly Encouraged at
Success
The Trachoma (sore eyes) free
Onic held at the Madisonville Y.
M. C A., building Thursday, Fri
day, Saturday and Sunday morning,
under the auspices of the Hopkins
County Health and welfare League,
proved to be an unqualified success
in every way. Dr. John McMullen,
surgeon and Trachoma expert in the
jovernment service, who did the
operations with assist'.nce from local
physicians, pronounced it the best
Clinic he has held, in many ways.
Thif cooperation pn the part of the
physicians and people of Hopkins
county he said was the best he had
ever known, and he said the prepara.
4ion and the building and equipment
provided was better than other prev
ious Clinics. Ana or volunteer neip,
professional and otherwise, there was
all and more than could be used.
During the three and a half days
of the Clinic well over 850 cases of
filleted eves were examined, most of
operated. The gymnasium room was
fitted up with beds, where the pa,
tients remained, usually over night,
after night, but many were able to go
home earlier.
The afflicted came from mujy parts
of the county, some fromMtore than
twenty miles distant. Che well-to
do father from Webster county visit
ed the Clinic Saturday, with two
youngesters, to get Dr. McMullen's
opinion on their eyes and went away
happy. Several cases of elderly peo
ple underwent the more serious op
eration of shortening the eyelids,
after having suffered much pain and
incapacity for many years.
It became clear SaturdayfTter
noon that the work could ndrbe com
pleied and Dr. McMulletr yielded to
request of officers of the Health
League that he continue and com'
plete the work on Sunday morning
This he readily agreed to do, and left
Sunday on the noon train for Louis
ville. Miss Williamson, organizing
nurse, left Monday for Henderson to
look after the matter of the Hender
son County Tuberculosis Sanitorium,
which has been hanging fire for some,
time on account of delay in making
the promised appropriation by the
fiscal court. This has now been ar
ranged and plans are being perfected
for the formal opening of the sanl
torium about about January 1st.
. Miss Neville, of Louisville, patron
of free Trachoma Clinics in Kentuc
ky, was there and helping in person
cut left before the Clinic closed, be
cause there was such abundance of
good local help present She gave
the blankets and much of the linen
used for the Clinic and made a cash
donation besides. The materials giv
en will become the property of the
Health League and go into its supply
5Jjests for future use.
The generous action of the State
Y. M. C. A., Committee in granting
the use of its building and equipment
free of charge to the Health League
for the Clinic has come in for much
favorable comment from those who
knew of this action.
Hiss Frederick, visiting nurse for
the League, is the happiest woman
Hopkins county and, though a little
worn by strenuous work, is ready
and busy again on the health relief
work to which her timers devoted.
Some thirty physicians of Hopkins
county attended the Clinic and many
of these assisted in the work in the
operating room. The' League pur
poses to hold these free C inics every
two months until Trachoma is clean
ed out in Hopkins county.

STANLEY FORGES
JBE ON T8P
Percy Haley Was Unsuccess
ful Despite Talk of Vic
tory Louisville, Ky., Dec- 10
Complete returns on the resell
of tho state-wide precinct cob
ventions held last Saturday
week ago folly sustains the
claims of a substantial victory
for the administration forces, al
though there were ambitious as
sertions to the contrary, before
the results were ascertained and
verified.
In all counties whero tho lines
were strictly drawn and wet ai
dry democrats contested for sup
remacy, it is remarkable in view
of the widespread .sentiment pre
valent in both parties, urging
submission of a prohibition -mendment,
that tho supporter
of the present administration.
Were victorious in a majority ot
counties over the Beckam-Hnley-
machine. The alignment, wet
and dry, was about even in the
other counties where (he prohibi
tion issue did not figure.
It is certain, from the develop
ments of the past week that
Percy Haley made a desperate
effort to again obtain a foothold
in state democratic politics, the
primary intention being to secure
enough of a following to accom
plish the nomination and re
election of United States Senator
Beckham a couple of years hence
and to give strong opposition to
Senator James in the 1018 pri
mary. Gen. Haley realizes, it
seems that the latter is ot major
importance, shrewdly figurine;
that as long as Ollie James is ia
the United States Sanate. Beck
ham must play a poor second
fiddle as far as patronage is con
cerned. And withont patronage
at his disposal General Haley i
an "also ran" in the political
field.

At all previous meetings of
this character, the theory of road
building has been mostly dis
cussed, but, after two years wor
under the state ad plan, road
men throughout the state now
have praotical problems to die
cuss and the program has bee a
arranged with that end in view..
It has been recommended by
the State Office that every
County Judge bring his ontire
court to the meeting and that
the county pay the expenses in
curred by such a trip.
