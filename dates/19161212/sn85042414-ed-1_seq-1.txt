Washington, Dec. 12.—Advices from Berlin to the
German embassy indicate that Germany's peace terms, in

before the war- with the exception of the establishment of
independent kingdoms of Poland and Lithuania.
They are understood to propose the complete restora
tion of the occupied portions of Belgium and France in re
turn for Germany's captured colonies and to dispose of the
Balkan situation because of its extreme complicated dan
ger, in the peace conference.

Presentation of Situation in
Belgium Before Depor
tation Order.
Majority Who Have Been
Taken to Germany Are
Claimed to be Contented
Berlin, Dec. 12, (via London)—
Germany's answer to the American
note regarding the deportation of Bel
gians Is confined almost exclusively
to a presentation of the situation in
Belgium before the deportation order
became effective. The note declares
that there was urgent need of some
kind of work for the Belgians, be
cause their Idleness was demoraliza
tion, and says that the deported work
ers arc assured of well-being In new
situations in Germany.
It is contended that the majority of
Belgians who have come to Germany
are happy and contented, with high
wages and increased personal liber
ties, and that only those who prefer to
loaf have been compelled to work.
The answer declares that .the meas
ure is entirely In accord w'ith Inter
national law.

London, Dec. 12.—The foreign of

Press that it is unable to discuss the
German peace proposal until the

Apparently confirm Previous
Reports of Change.
Washington, Dec. 12.—Private ad

telling of the secret proceedings in
the French chamber of deputies dur
ing the last week, confirm previous
reports that General Petain, the de
fender of Verdun, is to succeed Gen
eral Joffre in supreme command of
the allied forces on the western bat
tlefront, as the first result of radical
changes In organization which are to
follow concentration of management
of the war in a small council, as has

army, was a colonel at the outbreak
of the war.

ARGUMENTS ARE HEARD
Washington. Dec. 12.—Opening ar
guments in the habeas corpus suit
brought by H. Snowden Marshall,
federal district attorney at New York
to prevent the house of representa
tives from bringing him to Washing
ton to punish him for contempt, were
heard yesterday by the supreme
court.
Counsel for Mr. Marshall denied
the authority of the house in the
premises and reviewed at length the
causes of the contempt proceedings,
which grew out of a controversy
between the district attorney and a
house subcommittee investigating im
peachment charges against him. The
lower court denied Mr. Marshall's
petition for habeas corpus, directing
that pending determination of an ap
peal to the supreme court he should
remain technically in ihe cuBtofty of
the house' sergeant-at-arms sent to
arrest him. The arguments will be
concluded tomorrow.

Amsterdam, via London, Dec. 12—
The Telegraaf reports that the en

raids on various parts of Belgium.
The newspaper says a dozen airplanes
reached Zeebrugge, where anti-air
craft guns replied to them vigorously.

No Statement of Principal is

London, Dec. 12.—The absence
through illness of Premier Lloyd
George and former Premier Asquith,
the principal figures in the lai? min
isterial crisis, and the decision of the
cabinet to postpone until Thursday its
statement of policy robbed today's ses
sion of the house of commons of the
interest which usually attaches to the
first meeting of a new government
with parliament. However, a large
number of members returned to Lon

those whose petition remained in
doubt was indicated by the seats they
took, either behind the cabinet or with
the opposition forces.
Meanwhile the new ministers are
mastering their departments, which
most of them took over yesterday. A.

U. S. TO KEEP TERMS
SECRET FOR PRESENT
Washington Recalls Recent
Duma Crisis and Sep
arate Peace Talk,
Washington, Dec. 12.—In transmit
ting the note of the Teutonic allies
suggesting peace negotiations it was
stated officially that the United States
probably will follow the practice in
such cases and not make public the
terms of the peace proposals. They
would be known to President Wilson,
however, who would examine them to
determine whether they should be
accompanied by any word from this
government.
Peace proposals probably will be
discussed at the regular meeting of
the cabinet this afternoon.
Discussion in diplomatic circles
turned to the question of Germany's
motive in making the suggestion' at
this time. Despite rumors current
for some time and officially denied,
that peace proposals were soon to be
mstde, the announcement camegen
"rurally.as a surprise.
... Ooe prevailing opinion was that' the
jtierman allies had brought out their"
fpiace offer at this time wlth' tKe ex
pectation making terms' which,
might be acceptable to the allies cf
England and in effect might possibly
cause tlM) British government to yield
I to the pressure of the nations fighting
with her.
In this connection the recent crisis
In Russia, in which the duma inter
ferred to prevent the negotiations of
a separate peace with Germany, was
recalled as an indication of what the
German foreign office might be look
ing forward to. It has been acknowl
edged In entente circles that efforts
would be made by Germany to con
clude peace separately with her ene
mies, but so far all the entente na
tions have reiterated their determina
tion to adhere to their agreement
made early in the war not to make
a separate peace.
It was Indicated that while the
German allies might not entirely ex
pect that the proposals actually
would cause a peace conference they
were not without hope that they
would, and they were hopeful at least
that they would be the means of get
ting the belligerents together in some.
manner to discuss the situation, and
this it was expected, would lead to a
basis for peace.
In German quarters the British cab
inet crisis, the coming of winter and
the lull in fighting are given as rea
sons for making the peace proposal
at this time.
Make Entente Responsibility.
Among the entente diplomats here,
Germany's offer was pronounced to
be of double purpose and unlikely of
acceptance. The first, purpose, they
declare is to place upon the entente
powers the responsibility for contin
uing the war, and the second is for
the interna! effect in Germany and to
give evidence to the people that the
government was ready to end the
war, but was forced by here enemies'
to continue.
U.S. AGAIN ASKS SAFE
CONDUCT EOR ENVOY
Third Communication Sent England
and France Regarding Passage
for Austrian Ambassador.
Washington, Dec. 12.—A thisd com
munication was sent today by the
state department to Great Britain and
France regarding a safe conduct
through the allied blockade for Count
Tarnowski, the new Austrian ambas
sador to the United States. The com
munication says that again this coun- -i
try regards the unhindered passage o£'
the envoy as part of the admitted
right of diplomatic intercourse and'
reiterates the opinion that the allies
are acting beyond their rights in at
tempting to hinder such Intercourse
between this country and Austria.
As with the preceding note, which
was sent twelve days ago, the present
one is very explicit in pointing out
that this government does qot demand
a safe conduct for Count "Tarnowski
in its own name but is merely ex
pressing what it regards as the inter
national law in the matter.
The new note was prompted by the
feet that no reply has yet been re
