Indications today«point more strong
ly than ever to the probability that the
new defensive line of the Rumanians,
following their retreat from Bucharest.
•will be drawn along the Buzeu river,
forming the southern boundary of their
northern province of Moldavia.
Additional reports from Petrograd
dicate a considerable measure of

vance northeast along the railroad
from Ploechti, north of Bucharest, to
the town of Buzeu, located at about the I
center of the Buzeu river line which
stretches eastward to the lower
reaches of the Danube.
It is necessary to the apparent pur
pose of the Rumanians for them to
prevent an Austro-German advance
here until the Rumanian forces further
south in eastern Wallachla, retreating
from the region between Bucharest
and Tchernavoda, have reached the
Buzeu river line unless, indeed the Ru
manian military authorities have de
cided to retain a hold on more of east

STANDARD OIL CO.
AFTER K1CH LAND?
BIG FIGHT ON IN U. S. SENATE RE
GARDING WITHDRAWAL OF
1 PUBLIC TERRITORY.
1
[Special Correspondence]
Washington, D. C., Dec. 11.—A rival
for the attention of the senate today
is the Mvers oil lands leasing bill, with
the now* celebrated "Phelen amend
ment." This amendment waives the
iclaim of the United States to practi
cally all of naval oil reserve No. 3, in
California, the valine of which to our
navy and government is estimated at
from half a billion to two billion dol
lars. These oil lands were withdrawn
from entry by President Taft and con
gress later confirmed his acft by a law
which set them aside for the use of
the navy. Nevertheless claims were
located and the government has for
five years been fighting the cases
through the courts with almost uni
form success. Now comes the Phelan
proposal that "relief" in the form of
a waiver of the rights of the public
be given the entrymen, many of whom
are alleged to be dummies for Stand
ard Oil ana other big concerns, to an
extent which has driven Attorney Gen
eral Gregory, Secretary of the Navy
Daniels and even the reluctant secre
tary of the interior himself to protest.
So hot afire has been directed at
this measure by the National Conser
vation association, by showing that the
loss oi the naval oil reserve means
that the navy must give up the burn
ing of oil and with it the high speed
of its ships, that the Navy league has
issued a special letter demanding that
the Phelan amendment be killed. The
statement that the navy cannot be
maintained at efficiency if this oil is
given away was made first by Secre
tary Daniels. The estimate of value
of the oil at two billions of dollars
comes from an engineering expert for
the navy who testified at a hearing
on the matter. At a senate hearing an
agent of the department of justice tes
tified that Standard Oil was the real
defendant interest In seventeen out of
some twenty-three suits brought by
the government in conection with this
property.
Gasoline has bean produced and S9ld
profitably at nine cents a gallon from
a government receiver's refinery on
some of these lands. The proceeds of
these sales by receivers for the gov
ernment of oil Impounded during liti
gation 'is already $9,000,000. Senator
Phelan In his amendment provides
that the government shall give up-all
of this money^ Incidentally the pro
duction of low-priced gasoline will be
stopped.
