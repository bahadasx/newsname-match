Cents.
That old belief that the laboring man
possesses an appetite disproportionate
to the comparative amount of work per
formed by him and the office man, ha
been disprovrn by the plain fiKd teit
now being conducted by Mill Leno
Osborne, siqervisor of home economics
t the high school at least to her own
satisfaction.
Hearty Eatera.
She bases her conclusion on the fact
that at yesterday's dinner, every office
worker on the plain food squad ate as
though he had been starved for a week
and attributed the appetites to the
fact that none had "pieced" during the
day or indulged in the usual number of
loft drinks.
"One member of the squad," Miss Os
ttorne said this morning, "expressed the
whole thing by saying: 'About 4 o'clock
this afternoon every chili sign looked
ten feet high.' Too many office work
ers have the habit of rushing into some
soft drink stand or restaurant and
lunching at all hours of the day. It is
an injurious practice."
Ryan Absent.
Anthony Ryan, member of the Over
holser Flayers, was the first member of
the plain food squad to furnish any
really and truly excitement. He failed
to show up for breakfast this morning.
Miss Osborne and the remainder of the
squad were considering making him
abide by the agreement to pay 5 cents
lor every minute he is late which
would mean every minute from 7:.K)
o'clock this morning until he makes his
appearance for luncheon.

British Premier Says Prussian
Military Despotism Must Fall
LONDON, Dec. 12. Premier Llqyd-Goorge, new head
of the British cabinet, is not ready for peace and will
contenance no proposals unless they are such which
assure that what the premier terms "Prussian military
despotism" is definitely broken. In a copyrighted inter
view given by Lloyd-George to the United Press a few
weekn before he became premier, his peace views were set
forth in the following terms:
Just Begun to Fight.
"Britain ha only just begun to fight; the British
empire has invested thousands of its best lives to purchase
future immunity for civilization; this investment is too
great to be thrown away.
"The whole world, including neutrals of the highest
Purposes and humanitarians with the best motives, must
now that there can be no outside interference at this
stage. Britain asked no intervention when she was not
prepared to fight. She will tolerate none now, that she is
prepared, until Prussian military despotism is broken be
yond repair."
M6r Than Revenge.
"In the British determination to carry the fight to a
decisive finish there is something more than the natural
demand for vengeance. The inhumanity, the pitilessness
of the fighting that must come before a lasting peace is
ftossible, is not comparable with the cruelty that would be
nvolved in stopping -the war while there remains n possi
bility of civilization Again being menaced from the same
quarter."

far as the United Slates is concerned,
promptly on receipt of the official dis
patches in Washington. They will be
forwarded to all the entente countries
where the United Slates represents the

Whether the United Slates would
accompany the transmission with any
comment or suggestion, it was indi

Whether the offer is deemed one
