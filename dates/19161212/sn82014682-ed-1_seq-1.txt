With the arrival of Associated Press
despatches saying that Germany' had
expressed readiness to enter forth

6tock market halted. The tendency
was to wait until the morning session

of only one stock, but the market
showed weakness. This was evident
in some of the sugars after the session
but was more ; evident in some of
the unlisted stocks. ;
. Sales of 1560 shares between boards
reflects the business of yesterda
rather than today. Prices were, Olaa

Pioneer -41 7-8, Tanjong 35. At the
! session Oahu sold at 31 1-4 and 31, a
decline of 75 cents from yesterday.
After the session and after an an
nouncement of a 4 per cent extra divi
dend Ewa sold at 311-2, 75 cents be
low yesterday. y
Sales of unlisted securities, ' except-

Statement of
Attitude Toward Possible Terms Re
mains as Enunciated by Asquitli
and Grey, Associated Press is Told
; (Associated Press by Federal Wireless)
LONDON, England. Dec. 12.Some pessimism prevails htrt ovtr pros
pects for peace as suggested in Chancellor Hotlweg's speech and note to
day. Officials are skeptical that the proposed terms would even offer a basia
for negotiation. They say that the note addressed to the . Entente group
through neutrals is a dramatic coup which might create developments diplo
matically to provide the first peace overture.
The general impression in official and influential unofficial circles la
that the offer is unlikely to bring immediate results, particularly if, as the
emperor'g pronouncements indicate, it is made on the basis of the Central
Powers being victorious. (
The afternoon newspapers comment sarcastically on the offer. The
i Daily Newt says: Tne chancellor'a declaration Is almost blasphemous." !
BERLIN, Germany, Dec. 12. After reading the peace proposal note In
the Reichstag today, the chancellor said:
"If our enemies decline to end the war, . German hearts will burn In
wrath against the enemies who are unwilling to stop the human slaughter.
We are ready for fighting or ready for peace.

the chancellor, Dr. von Pethmann-Hollweg.
According to the Overseas News Agency's report, the chancellor
announced that German v and her allies, "conscious of their res

have )roposed jK'a c." A ' :
Kumors that the chancellor would make an fmK)rtaut statement
had thronged the galleries and the seats of the Ileichsfag were filled.
Practically all the members were present.
The chaurellor outlined the political situation and then, empha
sizing the achievements of the Teutons, made an announcement, which,
tays the news agency, may possibly be the turning-point of the war.
He sketched the iKlitical and military events of the recent cani
taigns, saying that Kumania had entered the conflict to roll up this
German positions in the east, and that simultaneously the Komu;fS
offensive by the Allies on the west had as its object to pierce tin
western Ifne, while renewed Italian attacks were made to "paralyze
Austria." '..'-V'':- . " -

Outline of Peace Proposals is Sent

German embassy give some authentic details of the terms which the
Central Powers are suggesting as suitable for peace negotiations.
The advices indicate in general 'what measures are proposed,
which will restore the status quo before the war, with the exception
that it is proposed by Germany that independent kingdoms be set up
for Poland and Lithuania. With these exceptions, it is understood
that no change is suggested for the map of Europe as it stood before
the war, save possibly what may be doue with the Balkans in a peace
conference. It is proposed to dispose of the Balkan situation at the
lcace conference, because it is an extremely complicated matter..
It is understood that the CentrabPowers rfropose the complete
