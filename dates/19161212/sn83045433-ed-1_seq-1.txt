Ira Landreth Scofs at Arguments of

A lottery for the offce of Secretary of

the Potomac River were suggested last
night by Ira Landreth, recently Prohibi

annual banquet of the Brotherhood of

Just as logical as the argument of "some
who believe that liquor must be sold In
Washington for the accommodation of
Ambassadors and others of this cosmo
politan population because they are ac
customed to their drink at home."
Mr. Landreth predicted that Washing
ton will be among the "drys" within two
months. He said such a result would be
the most vital blow ever struck the
liquor interests of this country.
"And If Washington goes dry," he de
clared. 'It will stay dry. There will be
no bootlegging or other evasions of the
law."
Mr. Landreth pictured Uncle Sam as a
bartender wearing a white apron, "be
aause that dear old uncle must tend bar
for the liquor interests of this country or
lose his job."
"There is no denying that the United
States is in the liquor business when it
derives one-third of its revenue from the
liquor traffle," he asserted.
Senator Wesley L. Jones, of Washing
