BILL PROVIDES
II. S. CONTROL
0FD.C.PH0NES
Congressman David J. Lewis of
Maryland Introduces Mcas-
uro in House Today.
WOULD AID GOVERNMENT
Suggests Postoffice Depart
ment Have Control of Lines
In and Around Capital.
Congressman David J. Lowls of
Maryland today introduced In the
llouie a bill providing tliat tho Gov
ernment buy the telephone system In
Washington and the rostoftlco De
partment operate It.
The measure proposes to authorize
the rostoftlco Department:
"To acquire and extend the tele
phone system of the District to Insure
the Government complete control or
such means of communication to. safe
guard Its mlllta-y and executive af
fairs within the seat of government:
"To provide a special telephone
service to facilitate the direct sale of
farm products to consumers In the
District;
"To establish the efficiency and
' economy with which such service may
be.poatally conducted."
HxlensUn of Facilities.
Congressman Lewis In an Interview
states ho believes the first result of
such ownership would be the wide
extension of the facilities of the tele
phone without materially Increasing
the cost of operation.
Mr. Lewis pointed out that the Gov
ernment Is the largest patron of the
telephone company here, paying
about $100,000 yearly for telephone
rental.
Not only are the toll rates to points
beyond Washington now prohibitive
for use of the telephone In connec
tion with farm to table buying, .Mr,
Lewis believes, but lie asserts that
Washington telephone users pay morc
hcnvlly for their service than
cltlxens of any large city In the
country with the probable exception
of San Francisco and New" York,
initiation Is Inviting.
'The Washington telephone sllua-
tlon In other respects would seem
to bu an Inviting one for postal ex
periments," he said today. "Its postal
chiefs are there and could settle nil
problems with the light of direct ex
perlencc. Moreover the telenhnno
rate fqr 1014 shows that the five-,
ace charge for each local call In
Washington was about -Hi cents.
"This Is more than four times the
' average cost per call with the Inde
pendent companies In such rltles as
Chicago, Plttsburjth. Indianapolis.
Kansas City, I.oulsville. Fort Wayne
and Uuffnlo, The telephone users In
these cities pays 07 cents per 100
rails, which In Washington com
about an average of 11.31."
Vested With Monopoly.
The bill provides that the Postmas
ter General be vested with a mo
nopoly of telephone communication
In Washington, and for the condem
nation and appropriation for Federal
use of the telephone company operat
ing here. '
All employe-- In the telephone serv
ice are to be Muted In the civil serv
ice. Tln Interstate Commerce Com-
mission Is to appraise the value of
the telephone properties,
Describing tho provisions of the bill
to facilitate parcel post buying, Con
gressman Lewis snld:
"At present the loll rates aro pro
hibitive for small transactions. At
tliiuicli Washington Is completely en
vironed by farms, they cannot be

MISSMiBWEfiS1
PRINCE THURSDAY
Marriage to Austrian Attache
Will Take Place in Bride's
Home.
Tho umrrlage of Miss Catherine.
Britten, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Alexander Brltton. to Prince Alfred
xu Hohonlohe-Schllllngfurst, attache
of the Austro-IIungarlan embassy,
will tako place at noon Thursday
at the Drltton residence In Q street.
Although Prince Hohenloho could' not
be reached and no member of the
Drltton family could be persuaded to
make a statement with regard to the
wedding, so much has been learned
on unimpeachable authority.
It Is understood that Mgr. Ilussell,
pastor of St. Patrick's Human Cath
olic Church, will officiate It was at
St. Patrick's that tho memorial mass
for the late Kmperor of Austria was
held on November 29. Tho ceremony
will be quite simple, owing to the
war nnd the court mourning, which
prevails In Austria, A small company
of close friends and relatives have
I een asked to attend,
Defies Court Objections.
Objections to the marriage of
Prince Hohenlohe and Miss Drltton,
whose engagement has been rumored
for nearly a year, were raised In high
quarters In Vienna, according to well
supported gossip current last spring.
The prince was detached from the
embassy at the time and sent to Cali
fornia ostensibly to compile a consu
lar report. -,
It Is tho general belief here that op
position to the nmrrlnne has not been
withdrawn, but that the prince Is dr
trrmlned to proceed with It lit the face
of all objections. Tiro prince was ex
pected In Washington yesterday, but up
to this morning the embassy knew
nothing or his arrival. It Is understood
that no members of the embassy staff
will attend th wedding, and that
Prince Hohenlohe and his bride will
live In California, which would lead to
the surmise that he will sever his con
nection with tho dlplomutlc service.
Prince Is Druiocratlr.
Prince Alfred xu Hnhenlohe-Schll-llngfurst
Is n decidedly likable chap.
He Is said to be but twenty-six years
old. Is fine looking, clever, and In
clined to be democratic. If Dame
Humor Is In be trusted, he has a com
fortable Income. He Is extremely
highly connected In Austria, Indeed,
he Is so close to the royal family
that It will be Impossible for him to
marry without the Kmpcror's consent
and still maintain his status at the
Austrian court, the most exclusive In
the world,
Cmlously enough. In view of the
fact that she Is tti marry an Austrian
nobleman. Miss Itrltton went to Lu
rope shortly after the outbreak of
the war, accompanied by Miss Nona
McAiloo. daughter of the Secretory
of the Treasury, and spent several
months nursing In the hospitals of
Paris. She made her debut several
winters ago and has been a great
belle ever since her llrsl sasnn, She
Is handsome and speaks several lan

Amazjngly Small Differences
.Found in Estimates on
Capital Traotion.
NOT 5 PER CENT FINALLY
Figure Slightly less Than
Eleven Million Accepted 'by
Both Sets of Experts.
Formal agreement to adjustments
of differences In the reports of their
two sets of engineering experts on
the reproduction costs, which varied
less than 0 per cent, was reached to
day In the valuation of their proper,
ties by the Capitol Traction-Company
and the Public Utilities Commission.
With the same object In view, but
employing totally different methods.
Consulting nnglneer Bailey, of the
J, O, White Company, employed by
the Capital Traction Company, and
Chief Engineer Charles L. Pltlsbury,
of the Public Utilities Commission,
reached practically the same conclu
sions. Uoth were endeavoring to arrive at
a cost of reproducing the physical prop
erties of the company for purposes of
actual valuation. Doth eliminated non
essentials and put their energies lo
work on the actual values.
' Adjustment Was Natural.
"The difference In the total cost of
reproduction of tho physical property
of the Capital Traction Company, as
determined by Its engineers and by
engineers of the commission was re
markably small and the adjustment
reached this morning the logical result,"
said Commissioner Kuts.
"To have the work of the com
mission's engineers confirmed by the
Judgment of the J. O. White Kngl
neerlng Company, with such a small
difference. Is very gratifying,
"It should be borne In mind thai
the agreement covers only the cost
of reproduction of the bulk of the
physical property belonging to the
company, and that the cost of repro
duction Is only one element of the
'fair value' of the property of this
company which the commission Is by
lv required lo determine,"
Working llasls Obtained.
This means, according lo repre
sentatives of the company and tin.
commission, that a working basis for
the valuation proceedings has been
obtained. The work or completing
the valuation can now go on with
some substlntlal prospect of an early
and thorough understanding.
The actual value of the Capital
Traction Company properties agreed
upon, representing the cost of repro
ducing the physical property or the
company, amounts to $10,000,214,
The estimated valuation set by Con
sulting Knglneer llalley of the J. 0,
White Company for the Capital Trac
tlno Company, was xil.'.MU.hSO. The
estimate or Chief Knglneer Plllsbury
or the PubUc Utilities Commission
was xio.-'l-MT.i. the uirrerence oeing
Sl,028.tSt.
Two Conferences.
Two conferences were held between
the engineers, As a result of these
Chief Knglneer Plllsbury prepared
a statement which was submitted
today to the Public Utilities Commis
sion, In which he raised his original
figure 7.38 per cent, making the total
amount agreed upon by the enrflne.-rs
as a fair valuation of the cost of re
producing 'the physical property.
This agreement oil the part of the
engineers and the small differences
In their figures, some of them being
the same and the fluctuations being
one way or Ihe other by both sides. Is
regarded by the utilities experts and
tho Capital Traction officials as one
of tho most remarkable exhibitions
or accuracy In engineering account
ing; that could be given.
STANDARD JNRAIsls PAY
Bonus It Granted to All Earning
Under $3,000 a Year.
NKW, YORK, Dec, 13. The Standard
Oil Compuny of New Jersey yester
day recognlxed the attack being made
by the high cost of living on Ihe In
comes of office workers', salesmen, and
other salaried employes by granting
substantial bonuses. Two weeks ago
the corporation raised the pay of
lO.dOO day laborers at four refineries
from 35 to 30 cents a day, making the
average day wage IS.&O for eight
hours.
The new bonus order affects all
employes of the company In tho
United States, exclusive or the com
mon labor department, who receive
less than S3, 000 a year. A statement
issued from the offices at 26 Broad-
rway sald4he directors had decided to

nature of a Christmas present. The
workers In the comnany's home

German Embassy Receives
Terms on Which Kaiser
Will End War.
WOULD RESTORE BELGIUM
Central Powers Plan to "Smoke
Out" Allies by Pro
posals. The full text of Germany's peace
proposals was received at tha Ger
man embassy wllhln the last twenty
four hours. They provide:
For the complete restoration of Bel
glum. For the evacuation by Germany of
all territory captured In northern
France during Ihe progress of the
war. '
For the establishment of Poland
and Lithuania as Independent king
doms. For the retention or Serbia by

For the restoration to Germany of
all her colonial possessions In Africa,
the far Kast, and other parts of the
globe.
For the retention or Constantinople
by Turkey. ....
This Information was obtained to
day from an unquestionable authority
close lo Ihe German embassy.
According lo embassy officials, who
have been kept fully advised of the
situation, the terms laid down rep
resent the united approval of all of
Ihe central powers, and were drawn
up after full exchanges of views be

To "Sssoke Out" Enemy.
It Is staled that no definite Informa
tion has been received by these pow
ers which would lead them lo believe
that the eoHente nations are prepared
to accept them, or even to discuss
them. ... . .
The prime purpose or the central
powers In putting them forth at this
time, It was learned from authorita
tive sources. Is to "smoke out" the
enemy governments and to acquaint
the Inhabitants of Germany, Austria
Hungary. Turkey, and Bulgaria with
a knowledge of what they are fight
ing for.
Proposals Hrgsrdeil Opportune.
The time Is regarded as opportune
for three reasons:
1. That Ihe recent victories of the
Central Powers In Ihe Balkans has
demonstrated, from the Teutonic
viewpoint, that these powers cannot
be crushed; that the war might go
on for ten more years with neither
side arriving any closer to a complete
victory over the other.
J. That with the approach of

SENATORS DISCUSS
PEACE PROPOSALS
Legislators Await With Concern
Details of Germany's
New Terms.
Newthat Berlin has made a new
peace move aroused Ihe utmost In
terest In Congressional circles today.
The full terms on which Germany
and her allies are willing to treat ror
peace are awaited with the keenest
concern,
It Is widely doubted whether peace
can be made under the present con
ditions. Flushed with the victory In Rou
mania, the Teutonic powers, It Is
believed, will be unwilling to make
such concessions as will be taken
seriously by the allies.
War to Finish, I'sllcy.
Moreover, the shake-up In Kngland
has brought Lloyd-George Into domi
nance, and his policy and that or the
men about him Is ror war to a finish
Thorn Is much skepticism here
wheUier the move of tho central pow
ers Is made with any other hope than
that of securing a better diplomatic
position. Without doubt, this will
tend to win good will for Germany
and her allies from pacifists In this
country
The American Governmenl, on Ihe
face of things, Is expected simply to
act as an Intermediary for the trans
mittal or the Teutonic proposals. It
Is deemed possible, but hardly prob
able, that the President may como
to the conclusion that now Is the
psychological time ror him to attempt
to mediate.
Hrnator Heed Pleased.
Senator Reed or Missouri wss en
gaged In his fight on certain amend
ments to the Immigration bill when
told or the peace movement:
"This Is Indeed great news," he
ssjd, "I hardly know how to express
my pleasure. Kvcrythlng possible
should be done to effect a lasting
peace. Just how? That Is more than
I can suy. It Is a great problem and
I would not undertake to suggest a
plan for solving It, I do not look for
any great effect on Immigration If tho
peace pluns succeed. Unless the peace
terms as flnallv agreed upon by the
rearrangement of boundary lines
should bring people under a ruler
that would bo obnoxious to them I
do not look for any great Intlux to
this country. The rebuilding or
Kuropo will require the help or all In
that country und I do not look ror
uiiv great umountof Immigration."
"That Is great," said Senator Shep
pard, when told or tho movements to
ward peace, "ir the good oMccs or
Ihe United Slates could be titlllxrd In
any way It should be done. Just how
Is not ror me to say. The President
has the situation well In hand, and
