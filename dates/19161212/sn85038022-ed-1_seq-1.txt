"A-Christmas shopping, sir" she said.
And then he said, uMay I ask where?"
"To the Square Deal Maris, on Square
Deal Square."

only could she find there everything she
wanted for each member of the family,
old and young, but ac the same time,
with each One Dollar cash purchase, she
got a ticket on the

fully equipped with electric lights and
starter, valued at $520.00, which will be
given away some time during August,
