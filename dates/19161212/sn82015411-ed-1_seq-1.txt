QUOTATION
IN
TRAGEDY EARLY
MORNING
D o i , a Japanese journeyman
plumber and sort of "Jack of all
trades," shot his wife in the back
mauka of Hanamaulu yesterday
morning and shortly afterward, in
the neighboring cane-field,- turned
the weapon on himself, sending five
bullets into his own body.
The man will probably die, as ho
is in such a condition that opera
tions are out of tho question. Tho
woman will likelv recover.
It in stated that Doi and his wife
had had family jars for some time,
and that another man figured in
the case. On account of their troubles
tho woman left home. Yesterday
morning Doi met his wife in an
automobile on a side road above
Hanamaulu. He fired one shot
which struck her in the back and
she fell in tho machine. He quite
evidently thought ho had killed her.
The woman was rushed to the
hospital and a search was instituted
for the would-be murderer. Ho Avas
found in the cane field a short dis
tance away from the first shooting,
with five bullet wounds in his body
and in a state of collapse from loss
of blood.
Doi came to Kauai from Hono
lulu about a year ago to work on
the plumbing of the new house of
Mr. F. Weber. He met the woman
here and married her on July 12,
last.- It was his intention to open
a plumbing establishment in tho
now Tip Top building, Lihuo.
Police Officers Enoka Lovell and
Kalei Montgomery found him in
tho cane field after the double
shooting.
The Mokiharia Club
The Mokihana Club met on Tues
day afternoon, December 5. Re
ports were received from tho Town
Improvement, Moving Picture and
School committees. At the sugges
tion of the latter committee, it was
decided to present decorated Christ
mas trees, candy and apples to the
Hanamaulu, Huleia, and Wailua
schools at the time of their closing
exercises on tho last day of the
term. A committee, consisting of
Mrs. Thurtcll, Mrs. Robertson and
Mrs. Winter was appointed to have
charge of this matter.
Mrs. Robertson gave a short ac
count of the work of the "General
Federation of Women's Clubs," and
Mr. Loomis followed with a very
interesting talk on "Community
Welfare. The hostesses of tho after
noon were Mrs. Coney and Mrs.
Trowbridge
Christmas Is Coming
E. W. Christmas, a scenic artist
who has toured tho other islands
and has recently exhibited his sub
jects at the University Club, in Ho
nolulu, will shortly arrive on Kauai

to tho editor of Tin-: G.utnr.x Island
by this morning's mail, Mr. Christ
mas says he hopes while here to
complete canvasses of some of Ka
uai's best scones.
Lively Night In Lihue

urday night, with its crowds, of
Christinas shoppers, the band play
ing in front and tho cafe and thea
ter running full blast across the
street. Tho cash receipts of the
store on Friday were nearly twice
as great as on the biggest day in iU
history, while Saturday's cash re
ceipts exceeded Friday's by more
than S300.

A
HE
I
FINOS 10NG BED
A prominent citizen of Lihue,
whoso family is away at present,
had an unusual experience in the
early hours of yesterday morning.
He was awakened from his own
slumbers by the snoring of someone
in tho house. Realizing at once
that something out of the ordinary
was eventuating (as an Englishman
might say), lie pulled himself to
gether and started on a very still
hunt for the snore and tho snorer.
The nasal music led him out to his
sleeping porch, which he had not
occupied for several nights on ac
count of the cold, damp atmos
phere, and there, comfortably en
sconced in the lied, was a Hawaii
an, with clothes and hoots on, "dead
to tho world," except for the snore,
which ho was keeping up with tho
vigor of the Lihue band playing
march music.
"What arc you doing hero?" de
manded the lord of the castle, at
the same time giving the intruder a
good shaking.
"I been Lihue", explained the
native, "and had one h good
time. Now I back homo in Wai
mea. ' '
A light dawned on tho Lihue man
at once, lie explained matters to
the intruder ami there was one sur
prised Hawaiian in that house in
stanter. It may bo of interest to know that
the fellow got back to his home in
Waimea and will probably simi the
pledge if some good prohibitionist
will call around there to see him.
SHOWER IS GIVEN
One of the prettiest social events
that Lihue has over seen was tlio
surprise "shower" given Miss Edna'
Penniman at tho beautiful home of

Earle Bowen and it was in recogni
tion of this fact that the Misses
Wilcox had invited a few of their
intimate friends to come together.
After tho guests had assembled in
the living room little Sam Wilcox
appeared, bringing with him Baby
Lois, who, with tiny wings and a
bow and arrow represented tho dan
gerous little god. Baby Lois
brought with her the gifts that con
stituted tho shower and presented
them to the bride-elect with a child
ish gravity that was most charm
ing. Dainty refreshments were after
ward served in tho dining loom at
tables tho centerpiece of tho table
at which Miss Pcnnimat sat being a
huge bouquet of maiden hair ferns
and daisies, which was tied with
white illusion and in which a
kewpie cupid was partly concealed.

lcna Jaguin, aged iVi years, was
