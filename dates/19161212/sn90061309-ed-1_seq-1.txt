The Timers of the University of i
nssouri by defeating the Kansas
Jayhawkers 13 0 on Thanksgiving
Dav took the football championship
of the Missouri Valley for the second
time since it was annexed by Bill
Roper's Eleven in 1909. The team
is one of the fastest which hBS ever
donned the old gold and black of
State School, and outplayed the
Kansans in every period of the
game.
According to percentage, Missouri
is tied with Nebraska but Kansas
defeated Nebraska and the Tiger'
clean cut victory over the Jayhaw
kers is the deciding factor. Missouri
with five regulars out of the game
was beaten bv the Kansas Aggies
7-6, but on account of this, the de
feated cannot be counted against
the team.
Since 1909 Missouri has been beat,
en by Kansas twice, as was the
case tbis year. The Odds are gener
ally in favor of the heavier Kansans
buttbe ability of Coach Scbultes
Missouriaos bas continued to irn
prove and their fighting spirit has
proven far above that ol toe team

Crovos rinr Thn u,hn will
turn next year are: McAnaw, Cam-

Sophomores of this year had many
men who will make promising var
sity material and tbis year's Fresh
man team is Missouri's strongest in
vears. The 1917 Thiers should be
even better than the 1916 victorious
team.
