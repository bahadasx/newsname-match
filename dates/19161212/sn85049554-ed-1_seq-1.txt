Peace Plan Would
Restore Status Quo
Washington, Dec. 12.—Advices
from Berlin to the German embas
sy indicate that Germany'* peace
terms in general measures propose
the restoration of the status^auo
before the war, except for the\s
tablishment- as independent king
doms of Poland and Lithuania.
They are understood to propose
the oomplete restoration of the oc
cupied portions of Belgium- and
France in return for Germany's
colonise and the disposal of the
Balkan situation in the peace con
ference.
nounced that Germany, together with
her allies, "conscious of their .respon
sibility before God, befbre their own
nation, and before humanity," have
proposed to the hostile poweris. to enter
fcito peace negotiations."
A Central News dispatch from Ams
terdam says it is announced officially
in Berlin that,, Emperor William has
notified the-commanding officers of his
peace offer. Until the uncertainty is
ended, the-message says, they are to
"fight on." The message is quoted as
follows:
"Soldiers: In agretement with the
sovereigns of my allies and with the
consciousness of victory 3 hafe made
an offer of peace to .-the enemy. Wheth
er it will be accepted is still uncertain.
"Until that moment arrives you will

Official Austrian Statement.
An official Austrian statement says:
"When in the summer of 1914 the
patience of Austrli-Hungary was ex
hausted by^a series of sy«tema.ticaily
continued and ever increasing jjrOyo
cations and. menaces on- the monarchy,
after almost fifty,' years of unbroken
peace,, found Itself forced to draw tjie
sword, this weighty decision was aril-'
mated neither by aggressive" purpose
nor designs of conquest, but'solely by
the bitter necessity of self-defense.
London Is Skeptical.
A general note of pessimism prevails
in London. One prominent official ex
pressed himself to the Assqciated PresS
today as being very skeptical that the
proposed terms Would offer even a. bas
lis
for negotiations.
This official said,, however, .that the
note was a dramatlc coup, which would
create interesting developments in the
diplomatic situation and provide the
first official peace oventures of the was.
The offer finds the foreign office upset
in the midst of a change of administra
tion but as the new foreign secretary, A.,
T. Balfour, has kept most closely in
touch with fpreign affklrs while serving
iii a different department in the late
government, it is.not expected that it
will take long for him to be as well pre
pared as Viscount Grey, the retirihg
foreign secretary, to take charges
The foreign office today informed the
Associated Press that it is unable to
discuss the German peace until the
terms have been received. Meanwhile
the attitude of the British government
toward possible peace terms remains as
frequently enunciated by the former

Germany's Failure to Negotiate Sepa
rate Peace With Petrograd Govern
ment Believed to Have Hastened
MOve to End Entirt War—United
States Only Asked to Act as Mes
senger in Transmitting Proposals.
Washington, Dec. 12.—News that
Germany and her allies were about to,
enter on
speacb
negotiations, was im­
mediately sent to
rPresident
Aor
Wilson.
Speaking fot the president, Secpetary
Tumulty sajycl he was deeply interested
but could make no comment, at least
untll it was learned whajt reception the
proposal received fronts the entente
allies.
The state department received its
first information
(of
Germany's pro­
posal from the Associated Press dis
patches, from which it was assumed

$dl'. countries where the
Untted 'States represents ^the central
powers diplomatically.
Whether the United States ^ould
make any sugg#tion depends entirely
upon the natnrS of the proposals. If
the offer is deemed one on which all
s!des might negotiate, the United
Spates probably would urge that it be
taken lip.
i" Hope to Force Russia to Aet.
One prevb-jling opinion was that the
xSfermSnic alUesj.Aa^brouglit out their
peace ofter'jit 'this tline with the ex
pectation o^.making term» whlch might
be acceptable to the allies of England,
and In effect might cause the British
government to cause the nations light
ing with her to accept.
In this connection the recent 'crisis
in Russia, in which the dnma inter
fered to prevent the negotiations of a
^separate peace with Germany was re
called as an indication of what the
German foreign office might be look
ing forward to in peace negotiations.
Surprise in Washington.
The foreign embassies and legations
received their first Information of the
event thru Associated Press dis
patches. On every hand the discus
sion turned to what 4ad moved Ger
many and her allies to make their
proposals at this time. Altho for many
weeks there has been persistent and
officially denied reports that some
peace proposals were about to be made
by President Wilson, there was no in
dication that the central powers them
selves w«Jre about to make them.
Efforts at Separate Peace Fail.
It has been generally acknowledged
in entente circles that efforts vtrould be
made by Germany ^t'o conclude peace
separately with her enemies, but so
far-all the entente nations have reiter
ated their intention to adhere to their
agreement made early In the war"no? st™01*
to makey a separate peace. The recent
death or the Austrian emperor, Francis
Joseph, with the succession of King
Charles to the throne of the dual mon
archy also was discussed as one of the
considerations which might have been
a factor in bringing out peace propos
als at this time.

Great Britain, Japan, Russia, Serbia
and Roumania: represents Turkey in
France. Great'Britain and Japan has
