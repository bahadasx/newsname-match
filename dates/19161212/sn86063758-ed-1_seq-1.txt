THK FIRST BAPTIST
CHURCH OF >EWBERRT
I have been reluctant to accede to
be suggestion that 1 write a sketch
of the First Baptist church of New
berry, for I have feared that I may
thereby incur the charge of meddling
In other people's affairs. But as such
a sketch looks to be .appropriate at
i this time, on the eve of the meeting 01
! the Baptist State convention, and no
! one eise has so written since 1890, i
i shall attempt, in the few hours ai
i lowed me, to give some account of
i 'Viof /Vhiirr>h
fWe have a good deal or material
on that subject down to 1890, in Judge
OTseall's Annals of Newberry sup
plemented by Mr. John A. Chapman
and Mr. John B. Carwile's Reminia
censes of Newberry, and above all, in
the admirable Semi-centennial Mem
orial address of Rev. Luther Broaci
dus, delivered and printed in 1882.
The citilio-ultv- is to select from this
maieixai auu 10 condense me uan<*
LiVes vuinin the space of say, a news
paper column. Either of these two
things 1 feel very doubtful of m>
ability to do properly; but I proceed
to do ihe best I can in the short time
I have.
Although the village of Newberry
was laid out in 1789 and was thence
forward the county seat, there was no
church building here until the year
1853, and no church organization at
any time except the Presbyterian con
gregation, which Chancellor Job
Johnstone says existed as far bac^f
as 1822, but which lie supposes after
wards "fell through." The organiza
tion and building of Aveleigh Presjy
terian church, just east of the town
limits, was in 183-5. A few persons
in September, 1831, inducrd four young
Baptist ministers?Nicholas W.
Hodges, James M. Chiles, Josiah Fur
man and John M. Barnes?all living
in other districts, to conduct a re
ligious meeting in the town. A stand
was erected and scats arranged in
the large oak grove about the ola
Newberry Male academy, just south
of Boundary street and west of the
railroad cut and bridge. The ser
vices by these capable and zealous
young men at once drew large and
apreciative audiences, not only from
the village but also from other parts
of the district. Indeed it is said

otrations of feeling at some of the
neetings. On the 30th day of the
same month the Newberry Baptfeij
church was organized with forty-four i
I
.nemb-rs. Nine of these, by the wa>,
a ere slaves, and two of them "free
1 agrees.'' And very shortly there
after about forty or more persons ad
ditional join >d the church. A large j
proportion of these converts were
among the wealthiest and most re- j
spectable of the citizens.1 A church
hnilriinsr of wood, was speedily erect- i
! etf. and was put to service early iti
! 1832. The church building next erect
j ed in the town was that of the Metho
j dists, in 1834.
j *Rev. John M. Barnes, above men
; tioned, served as pastor of the Bap
i .101 cflurch for some tiiree months,
! after its organization and w^as suc
; ceeded by Rev. Nicholas W. Hodges,
| above named, who served during the
1 vears 1832-34. Mr. Hodges was con
fessedly of immense value to Ms
church and to the cause of religion1
here. He was a man of fine talents,'
excellent scholarship, great piety and j
. zeal. He was succeeded by Rev. Dan- j
j iei Mangum?a very capable and /
forceful preacher?in 1835-36. Mi.!
| Hodges then returned and preached !
, liore in 1837 and part of 1838. In 1839 j
j n.ev. Thomas F*rean became the pas
, tor and so continued till his removal
| to Commoia, S. C., in 1842. Mr. Freau
was a name 01 county x ipijcia.1 j,
( Ireland, and combined -with natural
talents and some culture a large
measure of Irish enthusiasm. Per
haps it was his energetic conduct oi
services that incited me, on my tfrst |
; attendance at church (at three years
of age, with my nurse, in the gallery;
to >take an active part in the singing
And perhaps it wa?s my singing, as
well as his friendship for my fathei,
which led him to write me a poem [
a little later. He was succeeded |
(1843-45) by Rev. John Samuel Gib
son, who from an unfavorable begin
ning as an English blacksmith, be
came a wry earnest and effective
preacher.
Rev. Jonn G. Landrum of Spartan
burg Was the next pastor?1846-47.
He. like his predecesscfr, Mr. Gibson,
came here but once a month (the
latter coming from his home in
I Greenville district) but held service
1 both on Saturday and Sunday. Mr.
' Lane'rum was a very able, preacher
ana aiso?which, is a very uuvuuuuuu j
' concomitant of ability?a very popu
1 lar one. He is said to have baptized
j five thousand converts during the
fifty-one years of his ministry. 1A1
' ter him came Rev. M. C. Barnett |
! (1848-49)) who was very faithful and J
I efficient in his office. It is to be 1
| noted, as Mr. Carwile mentions, that
Mr. Barnett was the first pastor of |
1 this church who had no otiier cnarge,
and he li\ed four or five miles from j
1 the town, and taught a school near j
i bis residence.
! He v. John J. Brantly became pas
tor of the church in 1850, and so con
tinued until the close of the year.
, 1866. He resided in the town, and
I except for teaching a school for girls j
j during the War of Secession, gave j
his time and effort, undividedly to j

exception of four years of war, has j
seemed to me a golden age of this I
church. There was a large congrega- j
