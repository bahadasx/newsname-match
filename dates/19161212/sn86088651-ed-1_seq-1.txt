Derlln, Dec. 12. The German gov
ernment today announced that Ger
many and her allies, Austria, Turkey
and Bulgaria, have decided to enter
forthwith Into peace negotiations.
Chancellor Von Rethmann Hollweg
received representatives of the United
States, Spain and Switzerland, which
countrlea have been protecting Ger
man Interesta In hostile foreign coun
tries, and gave them a note and asked
them to give It to the entente govern
ments. The note, which was read
later In the Reichstag by the chancel
lor, stated that It waa the purpose of
the central powers to enter forthwith
Into negotiations which they believe
will be appropriate for the establish
ment of lasting peace. The govern
ments of Rerlin. Vienna, Constantino
ple and Sofia transmitted Identical
notes to the Vatican and all other neu
tral owers.
Chancellor Von Ilethmann Holl
weg'f speech, as reported by the Over
eas News Agency, was in part:
"Conscious of our responsibility be
fore God. before our own nations and
before humanity, we have proosed to
the hostile owers to enter on peace
negotiations. Rumania entered the
war In order to roll up the German
positions In the east and those of Ger
many'e allies. At the samo time the
grand offensive on the Somme had as
Its object to pierce Germany's front,
and the renewed Italian attac ks were
intended to paralyze Austria-Hungary.
"The situation was serious, but with
God's help our troops shaped condi
tions so as to give us security more
complete than ever. We are stronger
than ever and our safety Is beyond
question."
Chancellor Von Rethmann Hollweg.
In addressing the Reichstag, said the
peace proosals had for their object
ed to a discussion of It. The United
States represents Austria and Ger
many In Belgium, France, Great Brit
ain, Japan, Russia, Serbia and Ru
mania In Berlin, and represents Tur
key In France, Great Britain and
Japan.
President Wilson made no comment
on receipt of the news of peace pro
posals. It Is believed bere that the
peace offer at thla time was made
with the expectation of making terms
acceptable to Eng'.'nd's allies, who
might bring pressure tt.at would cause
her to stop fighting. The recent death
of Emperor Francis Joseph and the
succession of Emperor Charles also
waa thought to be a possible factor.

The reply volunteers to let Ameri

companied by any word from the

doubt that the matter would be dis

scheduled for this afternoon. The
