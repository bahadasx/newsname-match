THE CHANGE
IS RADICAL
Tim New English Cabinet Is
Sworn In
British Government Will Be Run
By Four Men.
IS HEADED BY LL0YD-6E0R6E
Lord Mllncr, Bonar Law, EarlCurzon
and Arthur Henderson Members' of
the New Ministry, Just 'Announced.
Position of Lloyd-George' Closely
Resembles That of a Dictatorship.
Duties of Each.
London, Doc. 11. Members o the
new ministry have been announced
officially.
David Lloyd-George, Lord Mllner,
Earl Curzon, Robert Bonar Law and
Artfiur Henderson form what is offl
ilally termed -lio war cabinet, while
Ihe others, who ordinarily have been
designated as cabinet ministers, are
called heads of departments.
An importaut point in this novel or
ganization is that it concentrates far
more power in the hands of the prime'
minister than the British system has
ever known before. Lloyd-George s
proposals to Premier Asquith were
for a war council, of, which the pre
mier should nave the power of pass
ing on its work. Lloyd-George has not
hesitated to place himself in the posi
tion more closely resembling a dicta
torship than ho was willing to 'give
his predecessor.
The war cabinet will hold dally ses
bIohf, dfrecting the prosecution of the
war, and the freedom of lAoyd
George, Lord Milner and Mr. Hender
son from departmental duties will al
low them to devote all their time to
tho war council. The work of the ex
chequer and government leadership
in the house of commons will absorb
most of Mr. Bonar Law's time, and at
tendance on the house of lords will
necessitate Karl Curzon's absence
from the council frequently. So that
Lloyd-George, Lord Mllner and Mr.
Henderson will be the chief directors
of the war. Tho new ministers were
sworn in today.
For practical purposes, the govern,
ment will be run by a cabinet of four
Whether there Is any plan for meet
ings of all tho heads of departments
of cabinet rank Is not known yet, but
councils in which the ministers of for
eign affairs, war and tho admiralty
participate with the others whose dit
ties directly concern war measures
will be certain.
The complexion of the new govern
ment is 12 Liberals, 15 Unionists, 3
Laborites, and the president of the
boards of. trade and education and
the shipping controller, who have
been attached to no parties.
RUSSIA TO FIGHTTO FINISH
Abandons All Idea of a Separate
Peace 'With Germany.
Now York, Dec. 11. Herman Bern
stein, editor of a Hobrow publication
and an expert on Russian affairs, said
here that the appointment of Alexan
der Trepoff to be Russian premier in
stead of Pturmer, means the empire
of the cyar has abandoned all idea of
a separate peaco with Germany, and
will war to a finish.
"Premier Stunner is an oxtreme're
actionary," said Mr. Bernstein, "and
has been very unpopular. He Is of
German extraction, as can be seen by
his name. His name made him Buch
ar objpet of dislike among tho people
that a short while ago he pleaded
with the. cznr to let him change it to
ono sounding more Russian. At that
time Js'lcholas was Intent on making
a separate peace with Germany, and
ie told Sturmor that thero was no
need.
"Now, things have come to the
knowledge of tho duma of ertorts on
the part of the government to make
a separate peace with Germany, and
It has been tho strenuous objections
on the part of this body of men that'
nave caused the czar to retire Stur
mor. Secret negotiations have been
discovered, and now a change In the
ministry is forced,"

seized with diphtheria and the family
was quarantined. When the young

ity in the government's ."nation-wide
investigation into the high cost of liv
ing will sliift this week to the middle

today for Chicago, probably stopping
at Cleveland en route. He will go
over with District Attorney Clyne in
Chicago information outlined for pre

troit, where another grand jury in
qulry will be begun this week. Later
he may go to St. Louis, Kansas Cty

Frank M. Swackcr, In charge of tho
grand jury inquiry in New York, In. j
formed officials that ho hoped to have
the investigation there started within
a few days. It Is understood that at
tention will be directed at first to the
activities of dealers and speculators
in coal, and that minor railway em
ployes may be summoned to testify.
Before leaving Washington Mr. An-i
derson will place his program before
President Wilson, who has already
received reports of tho Investigation
upon which he will base such recom
mendations as ho desires to make to
congress.
After analyzing figures obtained
from the department of agriculture,
officials conducting the inquiry sy
that ono of the chief needs of the
country is a more adequate method of
distributing of foodstuffs. The method
followed at present, It is said, would
fail in time of emergency.
