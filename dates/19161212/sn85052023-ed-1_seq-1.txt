NO TRACE OF
MISSING BOY
14-Year-Old Son of C. R. Reed
Left Home Two Weeks Ago
And Parents Heart-Broken
C. R. Reed, who lives on the
A. J. Thompson farm, on the
Danville pike just over the
Eoyle line, was in town Mon
day, and reported that he and
his family have been totally
unable to find trace of their
son, Charles Morgan Reed, who
left home Sunday two weeks
ago, and has never been seen
since. The disappearance of the
lad is the strangest sort of mys
tery to everyone who has heard
of the peculiar case. His mother
is almost prostrated with grief,
and is in a serious condition.
The lad, who is but 14 years
old, though large for his years,
left home on Sunday afternoon,
Nov. 25th, on his bicycle. When
-i i i All "L A.
ne am not snow up xnat mgiiu
his father immediately mstitut-
ed a search for him. He finally
jrot trace of him in Danville.
where the boy had sold his bi
cycle to a negro for $2, whom
he told that he was going away
on the train. A lady who knew
the boy, however, and lived in
the neighborhood, happened to
be on the 1:30 train going
north and talked with him out
of the window. She says he did
not board the train but that it
pulled out with him still on the
platform. Nothing further can
be heard of the child.
Mr. Reed says that the
youngster would often say that
when he became a man he in
tended to go to work in an
automobile factory, or some
thing like that as he did not
want to be a farmer. Mr. Reed
says that the boy was given
the very kindest treatment al
ways at home ; that he never
whipped him in his life ; and no
one can imagine why he should
go away as he did. At times,
Mr. Reed fears that perhaps the
lad met with foul play of some
.sort. He has notified the .police
of-Lexington, Cincinnati and
Louisville, and the officers at
Danville have done all in their
power, but the disappearance
of the boy remains a mystery,
and his mother, father, and
brothers and sisters are almost
heart-broken over the strange
afrriv. "Before moving to the
Thcr. pon farm, Mr. Reed ten
ru:.'"" on the Embry place on
the Lancaster pike, and is well
"known in Stanford.

DANGER SIGNAL
'If the fire bell should ring would
you run and stop it or go and help to
put out the fire? It is much the same
way with a cough. .A cough is a dan
ger signal as much as a fire bell. You
should no more try to suppress it
than to stop a fire bell when it is
ringing, but should curjs the disease
that causes the coughing. This can
nearly always be done by taking
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy. Manv
have used it with the most beneficial
results. It is especially valuable for
the persistent cough that so often
follows a bad cold or an attack of
the grip. Mrs. Thomas Beeching, An
drews, Ind., writes: "During the win
ter my husband takes cold easily and
coughs and coughs. Chamberlain's
Remedy is the best medicine for
breaking up these attacks and you
cannot get him to take any other."

the growers will only bring
him their crops and not sell in
the barns, he will make them
all rich.
About 1,000 head of cattle
were at the Jones stock yards.
Nearly every one of them was
bought during the day. Very
little of the stuff brought in
was extra or classy, but some
of it sold as high as 7 1-4 cents
a pound. Six and a half cents
was the usual top figure, how
ever. Mules and horses were
very active all day. Mule buy
