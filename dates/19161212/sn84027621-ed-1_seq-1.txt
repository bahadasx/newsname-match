(Associaied Press)
Berlin, Dec. 12. The Teutonic Al
lies propose peace.
PROPOSE TERMS OF
LASTING PEACE
Germany and her allies, Turkey,
Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary, pro
pose to enter forthwith into peace
negotiations. Chancellor Von Beth-man-Hollweg
handed a note to the
representatives of the United States,
Spain and Switzerland and nations
protecting German interests in hos
tile countries and asked them to bring
it to the attention of hostile govern
ments. Proposals were also trans
mitted to the' Vatican and all other
neutrals.
The propositions they will bring
forward are appropriate to lasting
peace, the chancellor told neutral en
voys. A semi-official news agency
said the note would be read in the
Reichstag .today by Chancellor Von
Bethmann-Hollweg.
WASHINGTON SURPRISED
Washington, Dec. 12. The news of
Teutonic peace proposals generally
was a distinct surprise here. No pre
vious open indication had been ap
parent' that the Central Powers were
about to make peace proposals. The
news was sent to President Wilson
immediately. Secretary Tumulty said
the president couldn't- comment on
the subject until he learned how the
Entente Allies had received the pro
posals. The state department and diplomats
in Washington received the first in
formation of the German proposals
through Associated Press dispatches.
Officials assumed that the nations ad
dressed were merely asked to trans
mit the proposals. The United States
will do this on receipt of official dis
patches. Such notes usually are not
made public if the proposal is deem
ed .which both sides might negotiate.
The United States will probably urge
its being taken up.
RESPONSIBILITY IS HEAVY
London, Dec. 12. A Berlin wireless
said that Chancellor Von Bethmann
Hollweg, in an address to the Reich
stag today, announced that Germany
and her allies, "conscious of their re
sponsibility before God, before their
own nation and before humanity,"
have proposed to the hostile powers
to enter into peace negotiations.
THEY NEEDN'T QUIT
A news agency dispatch from Am
sterdam said that Emperor William
notified his generals to continue fight
ing until -it is known whether the
Teutonic peace offer will be accepted.
INTENDS TO RESTORE THE
STATUS QUO
Washington, Dec. 12. German em
bassy dispatches indicated the Ger
man peace terms generally proposed
the restoration of the status quo be
fore the war with the exception of
the establishment of the independent
kingdoms of Poland and Luthiania. It
is understood to propose the complete
restoration of occupied portions of
Belgium and France in return for
Germany's captured colonies. The
Balkan situation is to be disposed of
in peace conference. "
BRITISH MAKE NO COMMENT
Londpn, Dec. 12. The foreign of
fice declined to discuss the German
peace proposal until the f terms have
been received.
TIME WASTED
Norfolk, Dec. 12. Proceedings of
the Southern Commercial Congress
halted when news of German peace
proposals was received, and a prayer
was offered for their success
IN BRIEF, GERMANY
Berlin, Dec. 12. Chancellor Beth-mann-Hollweg,

proposals to the Reichstag, said the

honor and liberty of evolution for the
four Central Powers.

pay the interest on the bonds. "
TICKLED FOLKS IN TAMPA
Said Nobody Home" was a Glittering
Success
The Tampa Tribune says of "No
body Home," which will appear at the
Temple tomorrow night:
Opening the season at the Tampa
Bay Casino, John P. Slocum's com
pany in "Nobody Home" was greeted
by an audience that was not chary in
its expression of approval. The com
pany is one of the largest on the
road this season and it boasts such
stellar headliners as Charles Mc
Naughton and Cecelia Novasio and
two wonderful dancers, Joseph Hess
and Gertrude Bennet. Aside from
these principals, "Nobody Home"
consists of a consistent array of lesser
talen and a chorus girl .outfit that has
little difficulty in passing the rather
indulgent "road" inspection. "Nobody
Home" carries its 'own - orchestra,
which was recruited last night by sev
eral local musicians. As a producer
cf the "laughter that lengthens life"
so the bills state it it is much
more than worth while and consider
ing the inf requency of good attrac
tions which, can be induced to travel
this far South in these times of the
atrical stringency, this show is en
titled to the "glad hand" and substan
tial patronage.
A PLEASANT OCCASION

Mrs. E. Van Hood will entertain the I
members of her large and enthusiastic
Sunday school class at her. home on

pleasant time.

City election is progressing quietly
today. Indications point, to the elec
tion of Dr. Chace for mayor. It will
not be for lack of hard work on the
part of Mayor Robertson however, if
he is defeated. We'd hate to have to
pay his gasoline bill for the last
forty-eight hours. It is reported that
the mayor said a few weeks ago that
he had the easiest thing yet, but if he
did say so he has evidently changed
his mind.

It is Not Unlikely that the Eternal
City will be the Target of
Austrian Aviators
Rome, Dec. 12. Notwithstanding
the presence of the pope, respect for
or fear of whom is supposed so far to
have saved Rome from aerial attacks,
it is now taken for granted that the
Eternal City with her countless mon
uments and works of art may soon be
attacked by Austrian aviators.
The Italian military authorities
have been actively engaged for sev
eral months preparing to-protect the
city from a raid, with an elaborate
signal system arranged by William
Marconi to warn the defenders of the
city of the approach of enemy aero
planes. The Roman newspapers re
cently published notices that the
alarm would consist of five cannon
shots, with the usual ringing of
church bells as a. signal that the dan
ger was over. , -
While so far it has proven impos
sible to prevent sporadic attacks on
London, Paris, ' Venice and other
cities, arrangements have been made
that may at least prevent the escape
of raiders who attack Rome. The city
is favored by two low mountain
ranges between her and the Adriatic
Sea, a distance of 125 miles. But
should the aeroplanes escape the coast
guns and the anti-aerial guns planted
on these mountain tops, the advanc
ing aeronauts will still find in their
path numerous squadrons of Italian
machines. The city itself is armed
with numerous high power search
lights and anti-aerial guns. The fa
mous Seven Hills of Rome, including
the Capitoline above the Forum, have
each been so armed.
The Janiculum Hill? which domi
nates St. Peter's church and the .Vati
can, the pope's residence, has several
guns planted on its brow. The Vati
can is protected by another set of
guns near the Castal Sant 'Angelo,
the solid and lofty marble tomb built
for the emperors, when Rome was the
world's battle center, and later con
verted into a fortress.
WTiile ther eis no uneasiness felt by
the people of Rome for their own
safety, it is certain, however, that a
bomb dropped anywhere inside its
limits could hardly miss destroying
some work of art in the world's rich
est monumental city.

Christmas present. We have them
