London, Dec. 11. The Associated
Press has received from Amsterdam
an "appeal to the American people"
by the Holland section of the League
of Neutral States. The appeal is
signed by President N'iemeyer and
Secretaries Delafaille and Walsh. It
follows:
"Your president has said that
sooner or later a moment would
come when the war would make the
position of neutral nations unbear
able. For us Hollanders that moment
has arrived; not through our own
Bufferings, but because we cannot
longer passively contemplate the
ghastly suffering Inflicted by Ger
many upon Belgium, our neighbor.
Condition Never Thought Of.
The eloquent protests of the Belgian
government and of the higher clergy
have Acquainted you with Hie facts.
A glance at the section of The Hague
regulations of 1907, which deals with
the law of war 0n land, will make it
obvious that the sole reason why the
prohibition of this modern slave
dealing was not included was because
no delegate imagined it could ever be
included. Indeed, one must turn to
the history of the early ages of long
past centuries before international
law existed, to find a parallel to the
enslaving of the Belgians. The Hague
regulations stipulate that tho honor
and rights of the family must he re
spected, but the German govern
ment deliberately drags the Belgian
families apart.

tyranny is not to be borne in patience,

"We appeal to you to urge your

That they will find faith and strength

St. Louis, Dec. 11. A reply to the
financial arguments advanced in op
position to prohibition whs given at
HiR Federal Council of Churches of
Christ here tonight by Ilev. Charles
Stc-lsle, field secretary of the council.
Mr. SteiJile said:
"The average working man fears
being out' of a job more than he does
going to hell. The liquor interests
have capitalized upon this fear and
by presenting an array of figures
which seem to prove that a calamity
will follow the abolition of the sa
loon, they have persuaded a large
number of workimr men to vote for
its retention.
What Census Itcturiis Show,
"The entire argument of the liquor
men is based upon the absurdity that
if the saloon-keeper fails to gel a
man's money nobody can possibly get
It. The fact that if tho money now
Invested In tho liquor business were
invested in the average Amerli'un In
dustry it would give employment for
four times many working nyii,
who collectively would receive four
times as much in the form of wages,
and fourt times as much raw material
would be required than Is now tin
case in the liquor business. These fig
ures are based upon a study of thi
United States census returns.
"The number of working men em
ployed in the liquor business has been
greatly exaggerated, duly 1 per cent
of all those engaged in manufiii t ui ini
industries in the United States in
employed In the liquor Industry thn
is 2,290 wage earners.
"Of this number, one-fourth arr
brewers, malsters, distillers and recti
tlers; three-fourth ure employed as
engineers, carpenters, machinists, bot
tlers and other occupations, which ai
not at all peculiar to the liquor busi
ness. Attention to Farmers.
"The liquor men nre paying a great
deal of attention to the farmer. They
are asking 'what will become of the
farmer when the brewers no longer
buy his grain and grapes, bis apples
and his cherries.' One would think
that nobody likes grapes, apples and
cherries unless they come in the form
of booze. The fact is that the liquor
interests purchase annually about an
average of $10 worth of produce from
each farmer in the United States. If
each person in tho United States were
to increase his purchasing power by
so much as a two-cent, postage stamp
per week, the people of Ibis country
would buy everything that the fann
er now sens io rne liquor men.
No Evangelistic Cumpuigi,.
The coiiiiOl finally ordered that the
recommendation for a nation-vide
evangelistic campaign under the aus
pices of the Federal Council of
Churches be eliminated from the re
port of the com mission on evangelism.
Several spoke against the plan.
The council adopted a resolution
calling for national prohibition under
an amendment to the federal constitu
tion and called on Christians through
out the world to co-operate In an ef
fort to establish peace on a lasting ba
sis of Justice and good will.

pected opposition in the senate t.'daV.
It became definitely known that Presi
dent Wilson will veto the measure i!
il noes to the White House with tin.
liteiacy test provision, one of its chief
features.
The president, early In his admin
istration, vetoed a similar bill for the
same reason the same as Presidents
Cleveland and Taft bad done before
him but advocates of the legislation
had hoped that he would not with
hold his signature this time if sub
stantial majorities were given In
both houses of congress.
Debate on the bill in the senate de
veloped into a general argument ovei
the question of exclusion of aliens on
account of race.
Provision us to Hindus.
Senator Works of California started
the discussion by giving notice that
be reserved the right to demand a
separate vote on a senate committee
cnieiidnieiit providing for the ex
clusion of Hindus and other Asiatics
by prescribing geographical areas
from which Immigrants shall not be
admitted without enumerating races.
Tho amendment, recommended by
the state dtpaitment after inquiries
!"id been . nujdo by the Japanese
government respecting provisions of
the bill as it passed the house, elim
inates all r ferences to the Hoot-Tak-ahire
passport agreement regulating
Japanese Immigration.
Senator Works Insisted that would
leave the United States at the mercy
of Japanese dictation as to immigra
tion from that country. As treaty
rights are involved, tho senate went
into executive session for the debate,
which lusted more than an hour
without a vote.
Would Evcltido Africans.
In open session, Senator Keed of
fered an amendment, to include the
continent of Africa, within the limits
set by the committee. He said he
would favor any legislation which
would keep out of the United States
any person not of pure white blood,
but he did not think it proper for
congress "to exclude by law and ad
mit by diplomacy."
"I believe," sa'd Senator Heed,
"the time has come when we ought
to keep our country from being filled
up with people not. cnpnblo of be
coming first class citizens of the
United States; people, who by birth,
environments, and disposition, or bV
their great ignorance, are not quali
fied to perform the duties of
citizens."
Answering a question of Senator ,
Gallinger as to whether Jews might '
as well be excluded as negroes, Sen- ;
.tor Heed s iid :
Tribute to the Jews.
"The Jews, by race and by blood
have been civilized for thousands ot '
years. They spring from the race;
that gave us our religion and the!
fundamentals of our law. 1 am not,
seeking to open the old black and i
white Issues in this country. It Is
plain that we should make an effort '
to protect, our citizenship from an
Influx of undesirables and keep out i
ell not eajiable of thorough amalga-
matlon." (
Senator Smith of South Carolina- ,
in charge of the bill, produced sta
tistics to show tliHt In the last !)
years there have been only about
1 4.000 Immigrants from Africa to
this country.
"What you are really proposing In
this amendment." suggested Senator
Vardaman, "is to exclude people on
account of race."
"I suspect you are
right," said
Senator Smith, adding: j
"All we have tried to do is to avoid
racial complication without running i
Into national complications." I
Senator Vardaman Introduced an
amendment setting forth that there Is
some doubt whether the fourteenth
and fifteenth amendments to the con
stitution, enfranchising the negro,
were properly adopted, and directing

"The ami ndmeni," t,aid he, ''leaves
the United Stales with absolutely
nothing but the so-culled gent Iviuen's
agreement on which to depend.
Whenever that agreement Is abro
gated, the entry of Japanese Into this
country would be unrestricted. We
would be absolutely at the mercy eif
Japan in the future if we have no
other safeguard or restrictions except
this agreement. The proposed UH
makes conditions much worse than
they are now. We leave it absolutely
to Japan to determine In the future
what of her citizens should come Into
this country."
Senator Lodge, ranking republican
of the foreign relations committee,
said that the amendment was "awk
ward. " but left the United States In
"no worse or no better" position than
at the present time. The effect, he
paid, was to exclude all Asiatic Immi
gration not already deluded by the
gentlemen's agreement Willi Japan.
Senator Works win proceeding
with his attack when the executive
session was ordered.
After an hour's debate behind
closed doors, the session was thiott
open and tho debate proceeded In

ators did not understand it thor
oughly, wanted to know 'Miv the

Senator Smith of South Carolina
replied that African Immigration for
years had been negligible.
"I can ice no common sense," S'ib
Senator Keed, "in excluding Inhabit
ants of Asia nod not excluding iu
balntunts of Africa. There Is not a
man on the floor of this senate who
would dare mnko the statement that
the people of Asia nre not fully equal

He proposed an amendment to ex

Washington, Dee. 11. The atten
tion of i (ingress was directed sharply
today to matter relating to both tho
army and navy, which nre expected to
be productive or agitation for even
more drastic measures of national
defense than have yet been seriously
considered.

naval committee, advocnted legislation
which would compel steel companies
and other private concerns to Rtva
prefeience to government orders for
military supplies. Ha will submit a
new section for the pending; naval ap
protirlatlon bill for this purpose, in
tirder to hasten battleship construction

guurdsmen for various causes operat
ed Inter to increase the number of re
cruits to approximately 60 per cent

In this connection also, army of fi

sional committee that tho funda
mental reason for the cabinet crisis in
England was the volunteer military
policy there prior to the passage of
the conscription act. The experience
of Croat Prltain is viewed by the of
ficers as the strongest of arguments
for the establishments of universal
military training in tho United States
as urged in the report of Maj. tlen.
I Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff, and to
which the entire American general
staff is committed.

retained on the border until June 30,
he said, tho deficiency will ho $50,
0(10,(100, The universal training ad
vocates are expected to uso these flB
ures In contending that prohibitive
cost would be the result of the prosent
system, If tho nation needed a greut
