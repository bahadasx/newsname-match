M
It. K. Wnttenburg, who haa recently
returned from a visit In eantern Wosh'
ington, brinKH with him a report of
the bunlnenn reputation of Kobert K.
Strahorn, on hln own "stamping
ground."
"In thai country," ho declares, "if
you want to work up a good, healthy
scrap, Just offer n fow adverse remarks
on the chnractcr of Strahorn and you
will find your troublo engagements
booked ahead for some time. He is
noteworthy for hln lack of making
promlncH and peddling 'hot-air,' but ha
lias Invariably been known to do more
than he agrees in a contract, and his
word on a deal Is all that Is desired by
his associates In that section."
This kind of report coming from a
man'' own home, a neighborhood
where much of his development work
has been dono and where his dealings
with the people havo been many and
varied, Indicates that Klamath Falls
and Interior Oregon hnn been fortu
nate to secure the attention of such a
man nt n tlmo when a development
such as he propones means so much to
tho progress of tho country.

KLAMATH FALLS, OREGON, TUESDAY,

WILL START AT
KLAMATHAVENUE
WILL RUN FROM THERE TO A
POINT NEAR DAIRY
Councilman Doty Holds Out For City
Extending Line Into Country aa Far
as Possible and Not Pay Expensive
Construction Up Link River All of
the Road Will Be Built on the
Clty'e Right-of-way.
The municipal railroad to be built
by the City of Klamath Falls will be
gin at the intersection of First street
and Klamath avenue In Klamath Falls
and extend southerly and eaaterly to
a point a short distance north of Dairy.
This point Is where the Bonanza
branch lino will Join the main road,
thUB completing the road from Klam
ath Falls to both Dairy and Bonanza.
Klamath Falls will own every foot
of this road and will own"the right-of-way.
Robert E. Strahorn, to whom
the right-of-way deeds have been
signed, will turn over the entire right-of-way
to this city. He baa agreed to
do this, according to C. W. Eberleln,
and he munt do It, according to City
Attorney It C. Groesbeck, before the
city can begin construction.
Whether it is good or bad, the credit
or the responsibility, as the case may
be, for the road notgoing above Klam
ath avenue, goes to Councilman M. R.
Doty of the Fifth ward. When the
route was first announced by Mr. Stra
horn, Mr. Doty stood against letting
the city build north or west of Klam
ath avenue, maintaining that the $300,
000 the city was spending should be
used to extend the road Just as far
Into the country as possible, and to let
Mr. Strahorn himself, If he cared to,
pay the expensive construction from
Klamath avenue, up Link river to Shlp-
plngton. Councilman Doty explained
this to Mr. Strahorn when the latter
was here; the plana submitted laat
night by Mr. Strahorn, through his
chief engineer, H. N. Bogue, and
through City Engineer Zumwalt, de
clared the route for the municipal road
to begin at the Intersection of Ktam
atb avenue and First street and to e
tend to a point near Dairy.
Mr. Doty feels that he has scored a
point. He aays that now, even should
Mr. Strahorn not continue the road
beyond Dairy to Sprague river and
Bend. Klamath Falls baa a line of its
own that taps Poe valley, Yonna val
ley, Bonanza, and Langell valley that
the city can electrify the road, operate
it Independently of any others, If
forced to, and make It pay dividends,
Of course, few people feel That any
such a condition as this will come
about. The citizens' committee and
the main railroad committee feel posi
tive that Mr. Strahorn very early will
build from Dairy to Bend, and even
will build the mile or so from Klamath
avenue to Sbippington, giving the tim
ber on the upper lake and all the farm
ing territory or the Klamath baaln and
valley to the east direct connection
with Portland.

Doubts Are. Wiped Out by Captain
J. W. Siemens, Who Agrees to tee
that the Flrat Intereat on Bonds le
Paid December 1, 1917. '
By a unanimous vote In each In
stance, the city council last night took
five distinct steps toward early con
struction of the Strahorn railroad.
These steps are:
The ordinance calling for sale of
$300,000 railroad bonds, was
passed.
The- report of City Engineer
Zumwalt on plana, specifications,
costs, and route of the' road from
Klamath Falls to Dairy waa ac
cepted and placed on file.
The plans, route, cost, and speci
fications submitted by Mr. .Zvnv ,
wait were, by resolution, declared
to be the basis for bids for con
structlon.
Police Judge' Leavltt waa di
rected to advertise for bids en the
$300,000 bond., reserving the right
to reject any or all bids;
Police Judge Leavltt was In

construction of the railroad.

The last doubt as to whether or not
the bond ordinance would carry laat
night was' considered wiped out just
before the vote was taken when J. W.
Siemens, chairman of the railroad com
mittee, publicly stated that he would
see that the Interest, was paid on the
bonds on December 1, 1917. The coun

dubious about voting the bonds be

payment of the first interest
The large crowd of citizens, that
