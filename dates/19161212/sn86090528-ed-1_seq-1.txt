GERMANY'S PEACE PROPOSALS
By Unitfd Press.
Washington, Dec. 12. Germany's peace proposals, according
to a German embassy official, will include and suggest:
That the territorial status of the nations engaged In this war
will be returned practically to what it was before the war
started.
That the exceptions are the establishment of the independ
ent kingdoms of Poland and Lithuania and some readjust
ments of International boundaries in Mie Balkans;
That the factors which led to the peace offers were:
The favorable military position of the Central Powers;
Winter halting military operations;
A desire to "smoke out the enemy;"
A desire to convince the world that Germany is not fight
ing for territorial conquest;
A desire to let the world know ihat Germany will not be
responsible for further bloodshed. ,

Wall street today. Prices broke from
two to five points on stocks.

Neutrals I
By United Presa.
Berlin, (via wireless to Sayville),
Doc. 12. Proposals by the Central
powers that peace negotiations be en
tered Into forthwith were made today
i. 'iotes tlv tvorcd to the ;jyreenu
tives of the neutral countries that ern
taking care of Germany's diplomatic
interests in the belligerent nat'ons.
Chancellor Bethman con Hollweg
called the diplomatic representatives
of the United States, Spain and Switi
erlaud to his effice cne after the other
and handed them an identical ...iie.
The same note vas also sent to :he
fpresentath i s of neutrals at in? cap
itals Cf lh natiosi.i at war, k'jiuestint
them to bring the proposals to tliu at
tention of enemy governments.
In the opinion of Germany the pro
posals submitted are appropriate for
bringing about a lasting peace. The
government at Vienna, Sofia and Con
stantinople sent identical notes and
tho communication was also sent to
the Vatican and all neutrals.
The exact text of the first an
nouncement of Oermany's intentions
as wirelessed today by the official
prstfg bureau to neutral countries, was
as follows:
"The chancellor this morning re
ceived one after another the represen
tatives of the United States and
Spain and Switzerland, that is, of the
states protecting German interests in
hostile countries.
"The chancellor transmitted to them
a note and asked them to bring it to
the knowledge of the hostile govern
ments. The notes will be read com
plete' in the reichstag today by the
chancellor. In the note the four allied
powers propose to enter forthwith in
to peace negotiations.
"The propositions which they bring
for such negotiations are, according to
their belief, appropriate for lasting
peace. The governments at Vienna,
Constantinople and Sofia have trans
mitted identic! notes. The text was
also communicated to the Holy See
and to all other powers. By handing
the note to the representatives of the
United States, Spain and Switzerland,
Germany really transmitted it directly
to her enemy nations. Under existing
conditions this is the only possible
course of diplomatic interchange be
tween the Central powers and the En
tente allies. .
"The procedure in the transmission
of Germany's peace proposals will be
identical in the case of all neutral
powers whose aid will be invoked.
The diplomatic representatives of
Aerica, Spain and Switzerland will for
ward the note handed to them by Chan
cellor Bethman von Hollweg to their
respective capitals."
United States' Attitude.
By United Presi.
1Va?hineton. Dec. 12. "if Germa
ny's peace proposals are such that she!
merely wishes the United States tOj
courier in transmitting them,
. Burw'iiment will pass the propos
als along without any comment. On
the "ther h?nd, if Germany's propos
als are that the United States, itself,
along with other neutrals, make the
n-oposals 'a their own hand in Ger
many's behalf, the administration will
study the propastls before taking ac
tion." These facts were officially revealed
at the state department after Secreta
ry of Staet Lansing had read the
peace dispatches. Secretary Lansing
would not Indicate that the proposal
came as a surprise tfut his manner in

Washington, D. C, Dec. 12. Accord
ing to the annual report of Director
Sam L. Rogers of the bureuu of the
census to Secretary William C. Red
field of the department of commerce,
covering the fiscal year ended June 30,
1916, which has just been made public,
the census bureau during that year
compiled and published the greater
part of the primary or fundamental
statistics from its latest canvass of
the manufacturing industries of the
country and carried on numerous oth
er Inquiries which it is directed by
law to make at regular intervals. The
preliminary figures from the manufac
tures census which show, among oth
er things, that during the calendar
year 1914 the manufacturing indus
tries of this country turned out pro
ducts valued at over twenty-four bil
lion dollars and, gave employment to
more than eight million persons, to
whom were paid approximately $i,
H(7.000,(H)0 in salaries and wages
were published at earlier dates, rela
tively to the period covered, than the
corresponding ones for preceding cen
suses. The bureau has begun the is
, suance of the final reports in tho form
of a series of bulletins which will la
ter be 'hound together in large volumes.
New Lines of Work.
Three important investigations are
planned for the coming year; one re
lating to transportation by water, an
other -to religious bodies, and a third
if authorized by the passage of a
joint resolution now pending In con
gress to marriage and divorce. The
first two of these inquiries are, under
the law, made at decennial intervals.
A new division the division of cot
ton and tobacco statistics which has
been created in the census bureau in
pursuance of a provision contained in
the last appropriation act, will have
charge of the cotton and tobacco work
heretofore carried on in the division
of manufacturers. Tho same act di
rects the collection and publication of
statistics relating to stocks of leaf to
bacco at quarterly intervals instead of
Bemi-annually as heretofore.
Reports are to be issued at intervals
of three months in which will be given
statistics as to the amounts of cotton,
linters, cotton waste, and hull fiber
consumed in the manufacture of ex
plosives and of absorbant and medi
cated cotton; and monthly reports re
lating to cotton seed and its products
will be published.
The annual collection of birth statis
tics from a "registration area" embrac
ing nearly one-third of the total popu
lation of the country has been begun
by the bureau; the i'rst report on this
subject will relate to the calendar
year 1915.
City Cartage.
A special inquiry to be undertaken
in he near future will relate to the
cost of city cartage as a factor in the
cost of living. It is known that in
some cases the charges for carting
goods a single mile from the railway
station to the home or place of busi
ness of the consignee are greater than
the charges for transporting them a
hundred miles by rail. Little is known
as to the extent to which this factor
contributes to the total cost of trans
portation and distribution, but there
Is no doubt that it; effect is very con
siderable; and it is the purpose of the
proposed inquiry to provide Borne reli
able data on the subject.

The census bureau has a permanent
force of nearly Curt officials and em

that Tuttle is proposing a bridge near
that place. Oklahoma City is very
much interested In a bridge at New

toward It, but would not be much in

anxious to join with Grady in this en
terprise. Mr. Rector pointed out the
great advantage ot having a bridge
which would serve the Meridian high
way. Mr. Mfdton and Ben F. Johnson
both discussed the rival sites from the
viewpoint of the interests of Grady
rouiity as a whole and tho business in
