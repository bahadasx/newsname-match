AXNOI XCEMENT IN FULL.
Berlin, Dec. 12. Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg's an
nouncement that Germany was
proposing peace was couched .in
the following words when he made
the announcement in the reichstag
today:
"Conscious of their responsibil
ity before God, before their own
nation, and before humanity," he
had proposed this morning to the
hostile powers a plan for peace.
GERMANY IS SAFE
Enemies Cannot Shatter Foun
dation of Central Powers.
Chancellor Hollweg Says
Speech Before Reichstag.
Berlin, Dec. 12. The chancellor
said the propositions which Germany
was bringing forward had for their
object the guarantee of existence, of
honor and of liberty of. evolution for
the four allied (central) powers,
Chancellor von Bethmann-Holl
weg's spec n is reported by the Over

"Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg

before humanity, had proposed to the
gotiations.
"Practically all the members of par
liament answered the unexpected sum
mons. The crowded house and
thronged galleries listened in atten
tive silence when the chancellor rose
for his speech. The chancellor first
outlined the extraordinary political
situation and then insisting upon the
achievements of the central powers,
made an announcement which possi
bly may be the turning point in the
war which for more than two years
nas nein tne world unaer its spell. The
chancellor said
rne reichstag had not been ad
journed for a long period, but for
tunately it was left to the discretion
of the president as to the day of the
next meeting. This decision was caus
ed by the hope that soon happy
events in the field would be recorded,
a hope fulfilled quicker, almost, than
expected. 1 shall be brief, for ac
tions speak for themselves?'
"The chancellor said Rumania had
j entered the war in order to roll up the
vierman positions in the east and
those of Germany's allies. At the same
time, the grand offensive on the
Somme had as its object to pierce the
German front and the renewed Italian
attacks were intended to paralyze
Austria-Hungary.
Security for Germanv
" 'The situation was serious,' the
chancellor continued. 'But with God's
help our troops shaped conditions so
as to give us security which not only

THIRD LARGEST H
WHEAT ACREAGE
THRUOUT STATE
But Conditions Are Poorer
Than Since 1910.
In Kansas December 1 Were
8,887,077 Acres.
SLUMP 12.5 SINCE LAST YEAR;
Mohler Places Condition at 75.9
Per Cent Here.
Wheat in Better Shape in East
Than the West.
With the third largest wheat acre
age in the history of the state, condi
tions are poorer than at any time since
1910. That is the text of a report
today by J. C. Mohler, secretary of the
state board of agriculture. He re
ports 8.8S7.077 acres of winter wheat
sown in Kansas December 1. Condi
tions are 75.9 per cent, a slump of
12.5 per cent over a year ago. The
acreage is an increase of 2.8 per cent
over 1915 and except in 1913 and 1914,
is the largest In the history of the
state.
Short acreage reports in some of the
big wheat producing counties of the
state occasioned a rather gloomy re
port from the secretary of the state
board of agriculture. In the face of
the war prices for - grain, such big
wheat counties as Barton, Rice, fteno,
Sumner, and Harper counties failed
to sow as heavily as a year ago.
Conditions for the next wheat crop
have been better in the eastern section
I of the state than in the western half,
j which produces the big wheat yield.

wheat counties, both preceding the
winter sowing and at the present time,

New Tork, Dec. 12. With the
market demoralized in the last hour
the activity was so grreat that it
brought the total transactions of
the day up to more than 2.500,000
shares, which is a record for many
years.
Prices in the last hour sold from
2 to 5 points under those of the
early afternoon. The pressure was
so great that the ticker was fifteen

New York, Dec. 12. Chancellor

Corn Props With Wheat.
Corn fell with wheat. The bearish
effect tho was not nearly so great, and
indeed was hardly more than has often
been witnessed as a result of ordinary
trade causes. After opening to
S1 cent down, corn underwent a
further sag to about 2 cents under
yesterday's close. ' Oats, like corn,
showed weakness scarcely beyond the
normal. Interest seemed to have been
transferred in the main to wheat. -
Peace news had a strengthening ef

The announcement of German
peace proposals served to stop the
decline in the cotton market here this
morning, prices advancing from the
opening of $18.18 for May to $18.50 or
about $3.50 a bale above the low
level of yesterday afternoon.
Trading became feverishly active on
the decline and urgent liquidation was
evident. Professional traders aided
the decline by selling of the more
speculative shares.
The selling embraced practically
every issue in that class in specialties
which have been strongest and most
active recently. While the market was
not demoralized in the first period of
heavy selling support was evident
only in the investment issues.
The news from Berlin was preceded

Bulgaria to Get Territory Lost

Turkey a Second Consideration

Washington, Dec. 12. German
Ambassador von Bernstorff received
the wireless message from Berlin to
day informing him of Germany's
peace proposals. These Include a oug
gestion that the territorial status of
the nations engaged be returned s
"practically" to what It was before
the war started. "
The exceptions are establishment of

Lithuania -win some adjustment or in-,
ternational boundaries in the Balkans.
On the latter question, it was said, '
the situation is so complicated that it
is hard at this time definitely to sug
gest anything like positive terms that
will be accepted by all belligerents. '. j
Bulgaria Wants Territory.
The one concrete suggestion made
is that Bulgaria probably will want ,
the return of the territory she lost in
the second Balkan war, and it is sup
posed Germany guaranteed this when
Czar Ferdinand cast his lot with the
central powers.
The peace terms, the informant
said, include the evacuation of north
ern France, restoration got the king- ,
dom of Belgium, at least a partial
restoration of Serbia and Rumania,
and the return to Germany of her lost
colonies.
The factors which are said to have
led to the German peace proposals at,
this time are: .
Why Germany Acts Now. 7
The favorable military position i
of the central powers. f
The fact that the winter at hand
will necessitate cessation of hard . "
fighting for three months. f
-A desire to "smoke out" the allies '
to annonce iust what they are fight-
Desire to convince the world and
the German people wherever they J
are, that Germany is not fighting a ;
war of territorial conquest, and,
Desire, if war continues, to let ths -
world know Germany will not be
responisble for further bloodshed. ,
The peace terms outlined, the !
German official intimated, are not 'j
necessarily Germany's final propo- jj
sition.
How About IApyd-George's Knockout?
The important question is to find out ;
whether the allies will talk peace said
