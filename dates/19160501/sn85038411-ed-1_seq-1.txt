Kingston. Ireland. May 1. —Tlie mili
tary authorities are tnkinff rigid meas
ures to prevent the escape of the
rebels, although this is made difficult
owing to the fact that most of them
discarded their Sinn Felner uniforms
and donned civilian clothes, which |
enabled them to mingle with the j
crowds of peaceful Inhabitants.
A military permit now Is necessary
to pass through either the inner mili
tary cordon or the larger circle drawn
around the city. The permit and the
bearer invariably are subjected to I
close examination. Even a stricter i
watch is being maintained over per- '
sons desiring to take passage out of j
Ireland from Kingston. Guards are j
posted at frequent intervals along |
every road In the country. The ap
pearanee of the central part of thoj
ritv is remarkable. There is no doubt !
that Dublin will show the scars of its
experience for a long time to come.
Many of the city's important buildings
are in ruins and hundreds more show
the effects of incendiary fires, artillery
shells and vandalism.
City Hadly Scarred
The damage by fire is far greater
than from the fighting. The most iiu- j
portant work of the next few days will ;
be the problem of providing for the !
people. Already the city has assumed i
the appearance of a town full of!
refugees. For a week no work has j
been done, and no work means no
money for thousands whose existence !
depends on their daily earnings. The
military authorities declare they are
making preparations to deal with this
situation adequately and promptly
without regard for red tape.

By Associated Press
Washington, D. C„ May I.—After an
exchange of messages between General
Scott and the War Department on his
conference Saturday with General
Obregon, Mexican minister of war,
officials said to-day the negotiations
up to date had been "satisfactory."
While General Obregon has urged that
the American troops be withdrawn,
President Wilson, they said, has no in
tention of granting the request at pres
ent, and is hopeful that an agree
ment will be reached for co-operation
between American and Mexican troops
in the pursuit of Villa and other ban
dits. General Scott has been instructed
to continue to press for such an agree
ment.
Definite final proposals have not yet
been reached in the border confer
ences. it was authoritatively stated at
the War Department. A long code
dispatch from General Scott arrived
early to-day. Secretary Baker, of the
War Department, expected to send
1 supplementary advice to General
1 to reach him. if possible, before his
i second conference with General
i Obregon.
1 While it has been officially admitted
i that General Obregon had "suggested"
i withdrawal from Mexico of the United
States expedition, officials said these
i overtures had not been in the form of
| a demand, and that no peremptory or
I unalterable position had been taken up
Iby either side. General Scott, it was
1 explained, had made counter-sugges
tions to General obregon proposing
co-operative military measures.
That the conferences have not
reached a deadlock was also stated on
official authority. No measures have
been taken 011 behalf of the United
States, it was asserted, which preclude
an amicable settlement.

Ingenuous Use of Light
Caused Snipers to Detray
Location to Soldiers
I Columbus. N. M., May I.—A story
of an ingenuous plan employed by an
American truck officer to rid the path
of the motor supply trains on their
way 'o the Mexican front of some of
the snipers that have been harrassing
them recently, was brought here to
day.
"We had been sniped at several
, times from the same point in the rock
| ■■annon. between K1 Valle and Naml
: qulpa," a truckman said.
| "On our last rip we received infor
mation that the Mexicans again were
| preparing to shoot at us that night.
I Consequently when we were within a
1 few miles of the place the train was
I stopped ami our lights were hooded.
|The officer in charge on the train took
| a small detachment and went i»
| a point opposite where the Mexicans
| were believed to be. lie tixed a flash
' light on a rock a hundred yards from
his soldiers and threw its beam in the
direction of the snipers. The Mexi
! cans immediately fired a volley at the
light, disclosing their whereabouts to
the awaiting Americans. In returning
the fire the Americans killed one Mexi
can but the others, possibly three or
four men, escaped."
