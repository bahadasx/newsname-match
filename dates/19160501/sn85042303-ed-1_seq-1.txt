About four hundred and fifty who

Most of those who surrendered, will

DAMAGE SUITS
TILED AGAINST
CITY-FLOODS
THE BUSINESS MEN ON CADDO
STREET SEEK DAMAGES FOR
VARIOUS STOCKS OF GOODS
BY HIGH WATER.
J. T. Coleman, acting as attorney
for five clients, has filed as many
suits against the city to recover dam
iiges alleged to have been caused by
nSligence upon the part of the city
in permitting water to overflow bus
iness houses on Caddo street Janu
ary 20 last.
The plaintiffs in these suits are:
J. H. Akers, who asks damages in
the amount of $312; W. F. Abbott,
who asks $373.15; J. F. McIIughes,
$459.18; Mrs. E. T. Ladd, $3C3.32;
and L. D. Mason, $272.65.
Plaintiffs in their petition allege
that the city, in constructing the
ser and openings, built one thit
yiis insufficient in size to carry off
the water, that their places of busi
ness were above grade, and if the
city had made adequate provision
for taking care of the usual heavy
rains, they would not have been dam
aged. Caddo street has been overflowed
on various occasions, and the above
named plaintiffs hope to convince
the city commissioners that it will
pay them to reconstruct this sewer,
and make it large enough to take
care of all surface water, under any
and all conditions.

Mayor Mullen has called a mass
meeting to assemble at the county
court house Thursday afternoon
May 4, at 5 o'clock, at which time
he wants to discuss with the citi
zens the white way proposition and
to get an expression from the tax
payers as to their desires in extend
ing the new system the entire
length of Main street.
The new sanitary ordinance also
will be discussed. There is some
criticism of it, and the mayor and
commissioners want to serve the
people as the people want to be serv.
ed, and if the ordinance does not
meet with the approval of the citi
zens, they want to enact one that
will.
Commenting upon both subjects
this morning, Mayor Mullen said:
"Every citizen of Ardmore is re
quested to meet at the Chamber of
Commerce rooms at the county court
house, Thursday, May 4, at five
o'clock in the afternoon to discuss
whether we will have the white way
or not. Now, please let every citi
zen who is interested for or against
be present, so we can get an ex
pression from you as to whether we
will enter into a contract with the
Ardmore Light company to install
the lights or not.
"There is on Main street one
block of these lights. Now, please
notice them and see what you think
about it. It is going to cost about
one hundred dollars a month more
for the lights than we are now pay
ing. This will have the lights from
the depot to the old opera house.
Look at the lights and come out
Thursday afternoon prepared to say
something for or against. Boosters
and knockers alike are Invited to
be present.
"In reference to the new sanitary
ordinance, do not begin knocking un
til we get the ordinance in good
shape and running. If you have snv
complaint, make it to the san't..ry
inspector, and we will try and rem
ed it. We believe this is a good
la v, and want your co-operation, hut
if you cannot see your way to give
it to us, let us know where you dif
fer. You may, perhaps, be right, and
if so we will do like you think, if
it proves to be best. If some of you
feel the law is unjust and not ac
cording to reason, then we will pass
one that is more satisfactory to the
people. Just a little help, and not
so much knocking, and we will have
a better and greater Ardmore."

Col. S. A. Mills, who has charge of
the Indian office in this city, has been
notified that after May 29 of this
year that all land sales for
Bryan, Marshall, Johnston, Murray,
Love, and Carter counties will be
held in Ardmore. The former rule
has been to sell the lands of each
county in the county seat town of
the county in which the lands are
located. Accompanying the new rule
were no reasons why the order was
made, but the presumption Is that it
was done because the lands are
scattered that remain unsold, and
Ardmore is more centrally located
than other towns in the six counties
and the order was made for the econ
omy of the business of the Five
Civilized Tribes.
Ardmore people will f-ppreciatf the
new rule for the reason that it will
bring to this city the buyers from all
