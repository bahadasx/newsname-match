, the Colonel's chances of clutching In 1916
the prize that etudeil his giusp In Hi 12
are waning peieeptlol with the eon.
eiitlon hnicly five weeks ill the future.
The conclusions that moved the llast
i era iiicmlnis of the Old Guard to exult

tenants here who have at vaiious times
l been called Into conference with Senator
I Murray Crane of Massachusetts. Charles
D. Illlles. Nicholas Murray Butter. Will-
linn Itarnes, Senator Holes Penrose of
Pennsylvania and James I', (ioodrlch of
Indiana.
Conclusion
It eni'licet.
those conclusions
Stated
definitely,
ale
Kit st. that the primal les Rfnerally,
and especially the primaries In Massa
chusetts, Ohio, MIcIiIk.iii and Ne
braska, demonstrated that there Is no
serious public demand that Itooevelt
be nominated.
Second, that the .tstoulshiiiKly larse
vote for Henry Kurd cast In the Mlohi
Ran and Nebraska primaries proves
that the people are not in sympathy
with Col. Itoos-velt's superlative pre.
paredi:es programme or with his pro
vocatUe pronouncements In regard to
the duty of this country to Interfere In
the Huropean war.
Third, that a cuna of the situa
tion shows that Justice IIURhes has
far more potential strniRth than Col.
ltoosevelt with the people at larse. and
that the unlnstructed delegates are
about " to 1 for Hughes nS respects

Kouith. that the Old (iuard plans
hae been so well laid that they know
a .-utllclent number or delegates can
be held In leash, come what may. to
block ItiKiM-wltV ambition us it was
blocked four jears ago.
These are the general conclusion, vro
coedlnc fiom numerous luncheons of the
Old Ciiiard leaders In this city, but they
barely touch on the private knowledge
and private' resources of the Republican
leadeis. who are nbvlously iiulte' as de
termined to beat Col ltoosevelt at the
lomliiR convention as they weie four
