Rank and File Lay Down

MUCH DAMAGE WAS
DONE DURING NIGHT
Law Courts Badly Wrecked
—Curious People Throng
the Streets.
Dublin, May 1.—•^Rebels of the
rank ana file followed the example
of their leaders and confessed that
the cause of the Irish republic was
but by laying down their arms at
the foot of Parnell monument In
Saclcville street, surrendering to the
British troops.
About 450 of them, who fought
since Monday in this central area,,
marched out from their strong
holds under the white flag and gave
themselves up. A few continued
from their lairs, and were

among the rafters of buildings near

government officials to be a pris

wounded during the fight.- Rebels
In the country districts also an

The correspondent of the Aaso

of disturbance Sunday. The

Severn was the fighting. The havoc
appears more extensive than it w
tuaflj Is owing to the amount of
dettds.
Every window of the law courts
has been shattered. The rebels had
held the building for a week. Val
uable law reference boohs and fur
niture were utilised to -barricade
the windows and through''the inter
stices between the bulky volumes
the rebels sniped without cessation
day and night and were flred on in
tnra until tbey were compelled to
evacuate the premises.
Houses all around were dented
with bullet marks. Some of them
were barricaded with thick oak
planlcs.
Today the streets were full of
curious people. Ihey were de
prived of food until the authorities
made provision for them.

Encirclod by Troops.
Dublin, Saturday, April 30, Via
London, May 1.—After a night of
desultory sniping which awakened
into feverish bursts of activity at
vaiying intervals, the sixth morning of
tho Irish rebellion was quiet tn tlie
capital. The authorities believe that
either the ammunition supply of the
rebels 4s running low or that it Is be
ing conserved for a last desperate ef
fort.
The situation today is that the Sinn
Feiners are enoircled by troops in the
streets of the city which they occupy
and have no possible means of es
cape vnless they succeed in mingling
with the populace.
Dublin oastle authorities in con
junction with the military chiefs have
devised and already have put'into ex

ing rations of bread, flour, meat and
flsh were provided and in nearly all
districts the supplies were ample.
Vires Burning.
Fires still are burning In the Sack
ville street center. Throughout the
night the flames rose high above the
roofs. It was, of course impossible
for the firemen to do anything to fight
the conflagration as both sides still
were sniping at each other.
The military authorities are unable
to give any idea of the damage dons
by these fires and are equally unable
to givedeflnlte Information as to the
buildings consumed. They think,
however, that between fifteen and
twenty houses, mainly business con-:
cents ..hive been destroyed.
While the flames were lighting the
sky after midnight, a rebel' flag of
great alas could be seen plainly flying
from a long distance, flying'seeming

of the rebels continues to be held
by them although the roof has been

December.
Halifax, N. S., May 1.—The fate of
the captain and crew of the British
steamship Suffolk, caught in the ice in
the White sea, while on her way to
Archangel shortly before Christmas,
together with the story of suffering
from cold, hunger and exposure re
sulting in the death of all but three
of the crew of 27, and the suicide of
the ship's captain, who, maddened by
hunger and cold, shot himself, was re
lated here by sailors of the New

in from Archangel.
The'erew of the Bellaventure, which

Mississippi Receding Near
on£)uty.,
.LaCrosse, May 1.—Optimism, caus
ed by a drop of four-tenths of a foot
in the river since Saturday, pervaded
railroad circles today. The situation
now is well-in hand, but with the
possibility of wrecks existing still, be
cause of weak spots in the embank
ment, no chances are being taken. An
army of men still is-patrolling the
railroad right of way north of here,
and trains are running on slow time
all along the Mississippi.
The decline of almost a half foot
in the river here since Saturday, con
sidering the great volume of water, is
considered remarkable.
South of lAC'rosse the situation now
is growing worse. At Prairie Du
Chlen, the stage is thirteen Inches
higher than Saturday.

London. May 1.—The tolls for ships
making use of the Sues Canal have
been increased by fifty centimes per

that has been incurred during the

rate of six francs 75 centimes. During
the year Ills the amount of shipping
that passed through the canal de

Paris, May 1.—As a perpetual sou

to Paris, the hole pierced through
the vault of the Metropolitan sub
way on the Boulevard Meilmontant is
to be left open and bricked up to
serve as a ventilator.
In the house, too, the general opinion
is that the republicans will not waste
much time in filibustering tactics, but
content themselves with as large a
vote as possible against strictly ad
ministration measures.
The minority whip, Representative
Hamilton of New York, already has
begun to notify members not to leave
Washington on days when Important
bills are to be voted on. The first call
came .yesterday when republicans
were admonished to be in their ssats
today to vote on the Philippine bill.
The democratic program for the
house, as finally decided upon after
much- discussion, is expected to bs
considered in the following order:
Philippines, Porto Rican, District of

naval and revenue billa The district

M. E. GENERAL
CONKRENCE TO
OPENJUESDAY
Policies to Govern for Next
Four Years to be
Determined.
Saratoga Springs, N. Y.. May 1.—
The policies destined for the next four
years to govern over four million
members of the Methodist Episcopal
church enrolled in 15,000 parishes
throughout the world will be deter
mined within the next four weeks by
the 27th general conference of that
denomination, which will be conven
ed here tomorrow morning. Nine
hundred delegates, comprising equal
divisions of clergy and laymen, have
been chosen during the last year by
1SS annual conferences in Europe,
Asia, Africa, and North and South
America to participate In the delib
erations of this gathering, which is
•the -world-wide legislathra-hody of the
,Methtrl .Among
the non-clerical-delegations are a few
women, who have been eligible for
membership since It00.
In the opinion of leading member*.,
this conference, by the nature of many
of .the questions to be submitted for
aotion, will be the most important
since the first delegated Methodist
assemblage was held in New York
city in 1812. Many of the delegates
came from Germany, Austria-Hun
gary, Bulgaria, France and Russia,
where Methodists are fighting on both
sides In the European conflict. A
fclace on the program has been given
them to present their impressions of
conditions in the war-stricken lands,
and for the first time since the out
break of the war, to report to their
co-workers the result of the struggle
on their efforts for the. spread of
Methodism.
Other delegations will represent the
churches In the neutral European
countries, Norway. Sweden. Denmark,
and Switzerland, where normal con
ditions of church work have been
overturned. The mission fields of the
far east, where political changes of
great importance have occurred since
the last conference, will be represent
ed by bishops, missionaries and na
tive workers, who will also give an
accounting of their labors.
Try to Unite Bodies.
While these churchmen from outly
ing fields are detailing the story of
interrupted work and of hardship,
the conference will deliberate upon
a plan designed to unite a rift in the
American church, brought about by
the same differences of opinion that
led to the civil war. Since 1846, when
the Methodist churches of the north
and south separated over the exist
enca of slavery, Methodist member
Ship has been divided principally be
tween the Methodist Episcopal church
north and the Methodist Episcopal
church south, each with Its own or
ganization, but teaching the doctrines
of John Wesley. Other scattered

Field Headquarters, Namlqnipe,
May 1.—-General. ftrahing, com
mander of the expeditionary troopa
in Mexico, is concentrating his cwiy
effort in estimating the situation
that he may plan for every possl
ble future development. Every re
port from the advanced cavalry
columns, and those reaching here
from the border are studied thor
oughly in an attempt to obtain the
proper perspective.
Scattered bands of VUlistas hawe
given no rest. Columns of cartlry
constantly are on their trail, and 1
these fugitives, now in groups of
two or three and singly, are nMilrlng
their way far into the mountain
regions In their attempt to escape:

To Resume Conference.
El Paso, May 1.—The resumption of
the Scott-Funston-Obresron confer
ence to consider American military
problems in Mexico will not be under
taken until late today or possibly to
morrow. when it is believed the ad
ministration will have had time to di
gest the reports that have been sent
to Washington by the American repre
sentatives of the war department
here.
Scott and Funston, with their aides,
worked far into the night, preparing
data and reports and the last code
message was dispatched to the war
department Just before daybreak. Sev
eral code messages already have been
exchanged.
It is understood that: army officers
have asked permission to take up in
its phases the question of with
drawing troops from Mexico, which
Obregon and his fellow conferees
brought to the fore at the confer
ence of Saturday.
That the conference here will fin
ally settle tiie withdrawal question
is not believed. Washington has sug
gested, it is said, that the American
representatives obtain all possible
data and information bearing on the
question that may be advanced by
the Mexican conferees and forward
full report for the consideration of
the state department, which now has
Carranza's request for the withdrawal
of American troops under advise
ment.
After»the conclusion of negotiations
here for the withdrawal of troops, the
Ajnerican conferees are prepared to
