London, May 1,—Official announce
ment-was made this afternoon that all
the .rebel leaders in.Dublin had sur
rendered.
Rebels of the rank and file followed
the example of their leaders today and
confessed the cause Of the Irish "repub
lic was lost* by laying down their arms
at the foot of' the Parnell monument
in Sackville street aivd surrendering to
British troops. About 440 of them who
had,fought since. Monday in this cen
tral area marched out of their stronir
hold under the white flag sjul gave
themselves up..'
Last Stronghold Taken.
Telegraphing from Dublin under
date of Sunday, the correspondent of
the Evening News says
"The last rebel stronghold to be
taken was the Jacobs, factory, which
was surrounded midday today. Cut
off from the center of the city the be
leaguered insurgents here had not
heard of the surrender of their-, chiefs.
They kept up afire from the windows
and roofs: and finally had to be sub
dued- by a battering of artillery.
•JSoon afterward- ?a rebel lieutenant
wearing a green uniform and carrying
a white flag -came in with a guard of
ten men £rom the. .adjoining: county of
Meath to learn the truth About rumors
Of a general, surrender.
"The party marched off to the castle
and learned from -J. H. Pearce, who

(-I-,,'1'.. Destruotion Is Great.
A corresjpondent of the Associated
Press visited the entire area'l of the
disturbance today. The. destruction
showed how severe was the fighting.
Every window of tlie law courts had
been shattered. The rebels, had held
the building for a week. Valuable law
reference books and furniture were
used to barricade windows.
Houses all around were dented with
bullet marks. Some of them were bar
ricaded with thick planks.
This morning the streets were full
of curioua persons who were glad to
have thfe opportunity to be about after
their long detention in their homes,
during which they were deprived of
food until the authorities made provi
sion for them.
Seven Hundred in Jail.
Down Corkhill and King Edward
streets strong guards of troops are
still in evidence and every passerby is
challenged.
As the correspondent approached the
castle, a party of more than 100 cap
tured/ members of the Sinn Fein
-marched by und6r~escort toward Rich
mond jail, "where more than 700 are
now held. Many of them were in green
uniforms. One wore the uniform' of
the Irish volunteers and others were
in civilian clothes.. Numbers of men
were Wounded and suffering but most
of them held up their heads defiantly.
