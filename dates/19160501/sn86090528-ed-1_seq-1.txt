ALL MUST APPLY TO
PRECINCT OFFICERS
DURING NEXT 10 DAYS
Certificate Necessary Regardless of
Participation in Last Election, De
clares Melton; Senator O'Neil
Explains Provisions of Statute
at Meeting
Although the impression has boon,
and It lias been so stated by the
newspapers, that citizens who voted
in the last election would be auto
matleally registered under the new
hvv, Attorney Alger Melton, of this
city, who has studied the statute care
fully, declares that all voter must
apply to the registrars for certifi
cates during the ten days beginning
today, otherwise they will uot be
qualified to participate in the coining
elections. In explanation of the law,
Mr. Melton furnlHhed the. Express the
following statement:
"Some contention is made that un
der the registration act those who
voted in the general election In 1'.lH
nro not required to register. A cart-1
ful reading of the act In connection I
with tho constitution convinces me
that all electors must register. The
registration law provides that no elec
tor shall vote in any primary election
In this state sinless he is registered.
The right to vote in party primaries
Is not a constitutional 'right. No one
Is permitted under the art,, to vote In (
hny primary unless registered as an j
elector nd a member of some po!lti-
cal party and he can only vote tho (
psrty tit ket of whbh lie It; a memfi'T
as shown by his registration certifi
cate. Without the certificate he can
not participate In party primaries.
"It is also doubtful if an elector can

Is registered. The registration act
says that the failure of the regintrar
to regibter an elector who voted in
l'Jll, shall not deprive huch elector
of his rifht to vote. This would i"
dicatc that tho legislature intended
to relieve those who voted in nut
of Article i of the constitution pro
vides: "In all elections by the people the
vote shall be by ballot and the legis
lature shall provide the kind of ticket
or ballot to be u-rd and make all
such other regulations as may be nec
essary to detect and punish fraud
and preserve the purity of tho ballot;
and may, when necessary, provide by
law for the registration of electors
throughout the state, or in any In
corporated city or town thereof, and
when It is so provided, no person
shall vote at any election unless he
shall have registered according to
law."
"In providing for registration
throughout tho stato the legislature
exercised tho authority given by this
section of the constitution and It is
extremely doubtful if the legislature
has authority to relieve any elector
from registration in view of tho pro
vision that 'uo person shall vote at
any election unless he shall have
registered according to law.'
"In view of these provisions of the
constitution every elector should reg
ister. No one should take a chance
on tho provision of the act, as to
those who voted in 1!'14, being in
valid." Chairman I,. C. Hutson, of the dem
ocratic county central oemmittee,
called the members of the committee
together with the precinct registrars,
appointed by County Registrar Mur
ray, ' In a special meeting Saturday
afternoon in the aud.'tiutn at the
city hall.
Mr. Hutson explained the object of
the meeting and introduced Senator
O'Neill, who proceeded in detail to
explain the several provisions of the J
new election law. In beginning the
senator stated that past experiences
had shown that tho ignorant and the
floating vote, the repeater and the
unscrupulous voter should be safe
guarded against. This, he said, was
conreded by all. Such being tho
of Committee
case, the legislature had sought to
throw about the ballot box a cloak
of protection against the illegal voter,
to protect it from the manipulations
of the unscrupulous and to enact such
measures as would safeguard its
sanctity.
The ballot. Senator O'Neill said, is
the sword and buckler of the law
abiding people of the state; it is a
Bacred institution respected by the
good portion of our citizenry; the
registration law forces the other por
tions to respect it and safeguards it
all from the ills which follow in tho
urke of loose election provisions. I
The senator stated that the law,
registration clause and all, as enact
ed by the extra session of the legis
lilt,lr(! ls jn r(.aHty a r0vit;ion of the
aw whU n wfls enactcd by tho Firiit
! General Assembly of Oklahoma, in
I 1!'07. The law, as it was enacted in
1 !(", will, the senator stated, he
. found in the 191 cods, sections 31")0
in 3 1 70. Inclusive. The present law
' Is that law modified to meet the ex
igencies of fle present time.

without having his vote nullified by

The registration of voters had to
be systematized, the judges and
c lerks of elections could not look out
for this, hence a county registrar was
provided with precinct registrars as
helpers or assistants. These precinct
j registrars are required to boo to It
personally that he who is entitled to
vote shall be allowed to register and
who Is not entitled to vote shall not
be. permitted to do so.

JUDGESHIP
DECLINED
BY MELTON
The office sought the man but didu't
find him at home, Alger Melton, of
this city, will not have the handle,
"judge," attached to his name, for
the reason that he doesn't desire it.
In reply to the reporter's inquiry
today, Mr. Mellon slated that he had
declined to accept the appointment of
justice of the stato criminal court of
appeals, a position that was tendered
I to him by Governor Williams, follow-
ing the death of the late Justice Hen
ry M. Furman. His decision in regard
to the matter was made known to the
governor some time ago.
"I have considered the matter ful
ly," said Mr. Melton, "and I feel that
under the circumstances I would not
be justified in accepting tho appoint
ment. My reasons are of a business
and persoui"; nature. If possible 1
w ould like to be of service to the peo
ple of this state but I think I can
serve them better as a private citizen
than I can as an office-holder."

Note: This is the lirst 01 a

dealing with the Swiss system
of military training for citi

sibilities of a similar system
in the United StateB. Editor,
(By William G. Shepherd, pnitetf
Press Correspondent.) ;
Berne, May 1. The men ot Switz
erland aren't soldiers, in peace times
They are only citizens who knowfl
how to BE soldiers if they have to.
The United States doesn't need i,
000,000 soldiers. What is DOES need
is 4,000,000 men who, know how t
BE soldiers, in case the need arises.
"I had a boy In college," wrote thel
father of a young British 80ldier
"One day he ran off and enlisted in, 1
a London foot regiment. After three) '
months' training his regiment was;
sent to Flanders. He waa killed at
Vpres. I am telling you this to help
ou preach the gospel of compulsorjj
training, not conscription.
"I am grieved and proud about my
boy. But I feel that his regiment did
not have a sporting chance. They;
only knew HOW T,0 GO ON AND
DIE. I feel that tho men in England
who oppose compulsory military,
training are guilty of a greater felony;.
than those who sank the Lusitania
This is the sort of feeling I find
this feeling expressed by this father,
that brought about compulsory mil
itary training in Switzerland.
Here in Switzerland where, unde
the marvelous system of military
training, a fifth of a million of the
finest soldiers in Europe were placet

compulsory military training isn't ii
tended to create soldiers. Its pui
pose is to create a nation of fim
strong young men and hale, heart
old men who will know how to Bi
soldiers if an enemy forces them t
play that role.
The Swiss aren't fussy; they don
love fighting. All these years
learning how to be soldiers, it tl
need comes, has taught them th
fighting is no picnic and that
doesn't pay to start a row Just f
the sake of rowing.

ONLY when some enemy drives h
to play that role.
That's the big reason Switzerlj
is at peace today.
It would cau ;o an upheaval la
