Apartment of Mrs.
Bloodgood.
SHAVED ASLEEP IN BED.
Hostess, in Scant Attire, Sat on
Edge Watching
Operation.
After ten minutes' deliberation to
day a Jury before Supremo Court
Justlco Clarko granted n divorce to
Hthel Lorraine Belmont, former show
Ctrl, from Kaymond Belmont, second
son of August Belmont, hanker and
traction magnate. Both young Bel
mont nnd his wife, who wero In court,
received the verdict with smites.
Otto Ft. Smith, a barber, was tho
most surprised man In tho courtroom
when ho learned that "It. L. Blood
pood," tho young man whom he had
frequently shnved In a modest llttlo
apartment at No. 22 West Flfty
nlnth Street, was tho millionaire's
son. It was In that apartment,
owned by Mrs. Bessie Bloodgood, a
middle nged widow, that the alleged
acts of marital misconduct took place.
Not only did Smith shavo young
Belmont, hut ho massaged Mrs. Blood
good, and, ho testified, was paid for
both shave nnd mnssngo by Mrs.
BloodRood.
After testifying that he hnd been
sent to the apartment by tho man
agor of the IMaza, Smith was asked
by Mr. Moonoy, Mrs. Belmont's
counsol, to look nround tho court
room nnd sen "Mr. Bloodgood." The
barber took a long look nnd thon
pointed to n -hort, wiry young man,
minus mustache who was sitting In
tho first row Inside the rail. "That's
Mr. Bloodgood," he said. "When I
got to the npartment I found Mr.
IIIooiIrooiI III a bathrobo ami I
shaved him. Mrs. Bloodgood paid my
fee. Mrs. Bloodgood was clad In a
kimono. '
The second time Smith shaved Bel
mont he found tho Bloodgoods to
gether In their npartment. Bloodgood
was In bed In a bath robo nnd tho
barber shaved him while ho slept. "I
guess Mrs, Bloodgood hnd a tender
feeling for Mr. Bloodgood for she
snt on tho edge of tho bed nnd
watched mo."
"How long wns Mr. Bloodgood In
tho apartment?" asked Mr. Moonoy.
"Well, I have known him to bo
thnro for three weeks at a time," tho
barber replied "I have dono work
for Mrs. Bloodgood on many occa
sions, The last tlmn I shaved Mr.
Hlooilgood, I also massaged her."
"And on thai occasion how was
sho clad?" asked Mr. Moonoy
"Rho wore a filmy pink silk crea
tion, not exactly n kimono, hut a
good deal lik one," vvnt, tho reply.
As early as October, 1DH, Belmont
visited the Fifty-ninth Street apart

testimony offered by Thomas Dunn,

afternoon that u squadron of the

Oen. Kredwick Funston announced
at noon to-day that only ono more

Mexlcnn representatives on tho mili
tary questions now existing between
this country nnd Mexico. Ho said It
would bo brief. Generals Scott and
Funston nre awaiting a reply from
Washington before setting n time for
thn conference.
Gen. Funston dropped a significant
remark when told thnt threo corre
spondents had returned from the
front In Mexico under tho Impres
sion that thero would bo no more
big events.
"I think they are mistaken," ho
said.
U. S. TROOPS TO STAY;
FUNSTON ORDERED NOT
TO DISCUSS RECALL.
WASHINGTON, May 1. Tho Ad-
ministration docs not intend to heed
Gen. Obregon's suggestion for with
drawing American troops from
Mexico,
This was lea i lied definitely to-day.
New and moie elaborate instructions
than heielofoie given went forward
to Gen. Scott following a conference
between President Wilson and Sec
retary of War Baker, and another
session between Secretary of State
Lansing, Counsellor Polk and Secre
tary Baker.
These Instructions are understood
to have emphasized previous orders
to Gen. Scott not to treat on tho sub
Ject of withdrawal. Instead, Scott
will lay stress on tho need for co
operation once more.
It was officially stated that the
troops are not now to bo withdrawn.
This means the Government Is de
termined to pursue Its plans for the
bieaklng up of Villa's bands.
Gen. Scott will probably point otr
to the Carranza War Minister that tho
de facto government Is threatened bv
factional enemies within tts own hol
ders, who would welcome an oppoi
tumty to rise against It. If the United
States wen- compelled to go Into
Mexico In considerable for'-c to make
certain the security of its own bor
ders against bandit raids that oppor
tunity nvlght bo prevented.

sp.ileh from Ambassador Gerard, out
lining his conference with Kaiser
Wllhulm was repurted en route to
day, (Tnolllclnl despatches from
Berlin stating there had been some
thliiR of a reaction In tho optimism
apparent there during tho last week
found reflection here.
The threatened delay In Germany's
reply Is causing some nnnoyanee,
though ofllclals rcfuso to comment in
nuy way on this phase of tho ques
Hon until word has been received
from Gerard as to' when thn reply
will start.
It Is deemed unlikely Hint Germany
would trifle with Anierlcm public
opinion to the extent of permitting
the annlveisary of tho Lusltanla
sinking next Saturday to pass
without delln'te avowals of intentions
in (ho present ease. At any rate, It
Is felt certain I hat President Wilson
will not wait longer than Saturday for
a reply, ami that unless there Is
early evidence thnt tho note Is ready
fur despatch ho will suggest to Gerard
that tho time Is up.
BKKLIN, May l Ambassador Ger
ard will return from his visit to tho
Kalsor at the battle front this after
noon. Mr, Gerard was tho Kaiser's
dlnnor guest at tho front, sitting be
tween tbo Kmpuror and Chancellor
von llethmanii-Hollweg. Thu Kaiser
Is understood to have told Mr, Ger
ard ho wnnted no break with Amer
ica and Miucctfly desired continuance
of friendly relations, Tho Kaiser and
Mr. Geraid held a long conference,
It is said the visit was not of th
Kaiser's seeking, Mr. Gerard lialng
Intimated he desired to see I he ruler
beforn an ansnor wast mado to thu

Thero appeals to bo no tangible

EYE WITNESS DESCRIBES
RUIN WROUGHT IN DUBLIN
DUBLIN, May l. The last rebel stronghold to be taken was
Jacobs's Biscuit Factory, which was surrounded: yesterday at noon. Cut
off from the centre of the city, the bileaKiired insurgents had not heard
of the capitulation of their chiefs. They kept up a fusillade from the roofs
and windows and finally had to be subdued by a battery of artillery.
Harlier in the day about 45o others of the rank and file had followed
the example of their leaders. They marched out of their strongholds
under white flags and surrendered at the foot of the Parnell Memorial.
A few irrecondlables continued sniping from roofs of buildings nearby.
Soon afterwards a rebel lieutenant, wearing a heather green uniform
and carrying a white flag, came in with a guard of ten men from the
adjoining county of Meath to learn the truth about rumors of a general
surrender. The party marched off to
H. Pearce, who was named Provisional President of the Irish Republic,
that the movement had collapsed, and was advised to resist no longer.
The lieutenant and his escort then started out to parley with the rebels in
the country districts in an effort to induce them to lay down their arms.
Troops were making a systematic canvass of the city, searching
every house for arms and ammunition and arresting suspects in houses
where rebel uniforms were found.
James Connolly, one of the leaders of the uprising, is said by
Government officials to be a prisoner in the Castle. He is suffering
from wounds.

More than 1,200 rebels have been taken in Dublin and other centres
of rebellion. The latest estimates place the total number of dead and
wounded in the fighting at about 200 and the property loss at more than
1 0,000,000.
