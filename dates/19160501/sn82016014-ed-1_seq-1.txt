New York. May 1.- Harry Bruere,
known throughout the country for his
efficiency work in municipal govern

chamberlain of the city of New York
and left a perfectly good $12,000 a
year job kicking around because he
said the job was a senseless waste of
money and he could not keep up the
pretense.
Bruere said the work he did could be
handled easily by other city officials
who haven't any too much to do.
Bruere came from St. Charles. Mo.
He originated the Dayton plan of city
managership as it is employed in that
place, was at one time an executive of
the International Harvester company
in Chicago and more recently did so
cial service work in Boston. He has
not announcd his plans for the future.

Washington, May 1. A regular
army of 180.000 men at peace strength
has practically been agreed upon by
senate and house conferees on the
army bill. With the plans for ex
pansion as provided in the bill which
has parsed the senate, this would pro

the senate fixed the peace strength at
250.000 men.
The agreement on the size of the bill
in dispute, it was urged by the con

tentative basis for the size of the army
before they could make any progress
on details.

meeting; here tomorrow probably
will take up Vretl Bissell's re
quest that lie he allowed to un
dergo an operation to relieve an
alleged injury to liis brain sus
tained many years ago by a kick
from a horse. The confessed
murderer of Kdua Oinsinore fctill
is confined in the Administration
building at the state prison away
from other convicts. Altlwugh
Hissell has made no threats to end
his life, prison officials are keep
ing a close w atch uion hi in.
Fred Bissell, pardoned by Governor
Capper that he might join the army,
was not eligible to service with Uncle.
Sam's troops. Bissell's prison record
made him ineligible. Yet the confessed
murderer of lidna Dinsmore was given
the rights of citizenship that he. might
enter army service. Bissell never en
listed. After the Dinsmore murder
Governor Capper withdrew Bissell's
citizenship.
Statements by Governor Capper
that he had released Bissell in order
to permit him to join the army,
brought a most vigorous protest today
from O. R. Cole, first lieutenant of the
United States infantry, recruiting offi
cer, United States army. Cole believes
the governor's action was a reflection
on the government army service and
declares that Bissell could not have
been admitted to service.
In explanation of his release of Bis
sell, Governor Capper has repeatedly
stated that it was to permit the man
to join the -army.
"He wanted to enlist, but eoyld not
join the army so long as he, was under
parole from the.-penitentiary,0 ftaid
Utywiiw Jtt-p pr -rn--i-a tern?n t to'the
State Journal Saturday. "I restored
his citizenship that he might enter
the army service. Nothing belter
could have been done for the man.
His release by me, however,: was con
ditioned on his joining the army. I
considered that hia rights were auto
matically cancelled when he did not-
make good his part of the agreement."
The plan to give convicts and de
generates to Uncle Sam for his army
service is not popular with the army,
however even when the offer comes
from a governor.
l aw Is Positive.
"Thj impression in the minds of
some people seems to be that Bissell
was eligible for service in the United
States army as soon as his citizenship
had been restored." savs Lieutenant
Cole in a letter to the Stale Journal.
"Such, however, is not the case as the
law is very positive on the subject and
you will see by the following section
of the military law of the United
States'
Lieutenant Cole then quoted from
section 1U27 of the military laws. The
section reads:
'"Persons not to be enlisted: No
minor under the age of sixteen years,
no insane or intoxicated persons, no
deserter from the military service of
the United States and no person who
has been convicted of a felony shall be
enlisted or mustered into the military
service. (Sec. 1118 R. S.)"
"In justice to the army and in order
to clear the public mind o the im
pression that the United States army
would or could enlist any man with a
prison record of any ki. d. it is re
quested that the laws on the subject
be published," Cole wrote.
Possibly Bissell merely "put one
over" on Governor Capper, who gave
the man rights of citizenship to do.
something that was illegal. Possibly,
though, the governor granted the cit
izenship without a knowledge of the
law. Both the attorney general's of
fice and the office of Charles 1. Mar
tin, adjutant general, are in the state
house and within easy access of the
governor's office.
It was while Bissell was enjoying
the rights of a citizen as given him by
the governor, that Edna Dinsmore was 1
assaulted and murdered. j

Germans Today Adopt More
Sunshine Scheme.
All Clocks In Empire Set an
Hour in Advance.
Washington, May 1. Whether the
example of the German government,
which set al' the clocks in the empire
ahead one hour today, could be fol
lowed in this country to good advan
tage, is doubted.
It seems impossible that there can
be harmony in time relations between
nations when, as in the case of Ger
many, time afier today will be meas
ured by a new standard.
It is announced by the bundesrath
that the advancing of time one hour
in Germany will result in a vast sav
ing of money, not to speak of the
health benefits that will accrue to the
workers, who will go to bed an hour
earlier each night and get up an hour
earlier than usual.
According to economists in this city,
the action of the bundesrath was pri
marily taken to conserve the nation's
resources, two of which are lighting
and fuel and both of which are ad
mittedly growing more scarce.
After Ma;' 1, under the new time
standard, the nation will be just one
hour ahead of the world. While work
men of other European nations and
the United States are spending the
hour between five and six, . snoozing,
thoj?e of Germany will be hard at
work. At the close of their working
day the Germans will have an extra
hour for recreation.

With the weather a little more fa
vorable than it was Sunday, Lattl
more's Savages and the St. Joe Drum
mers were scheduled to go at it again
this afternoon at 3:15 at Western
League park.
Denny Sullivan, of the Drummers,
stated that either Sommers, Thomas
or Patterson would work for the Hol
landers, and Lattimnre was sure he
would work Marshall, one of his best
twirlers. The members of the local
club realized that if Sommers worked
they would have a real battle on their
hands and that Marshall would have
to do some tall pitching to win.
Owner Holland, of the' St. Joe team,
went home Sunday but he was back
on the job again today. Tomorrow
will end the present at home series of
the Savages and there will be no more
I games here until May 12 when W ich-
ita comes for a three day stand.

means the government is determined
to pursue its plan for breaking up
