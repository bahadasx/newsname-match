MARSHALL FIELD IV. ON
WAY TOCHICAG0
Stork Plans a Visit to Merchant Prince's Home Soon ;
Family Awaits Destiny of Fourth Generation Heir
j A Billionaire Youngster.
Chicago's richest and most widely-known
' family is waiting and
watching to see what the story is go

The month for the arrival of the
story is July. And if it's a boy Chi

known family will have a Marshall
Field the Fourth.
Marshall Field the Third and his
wife will be moved in May from
Aiken, N. C, to Long Island, N. Y.
The prospective mother was Evelyn
Marshall of New York and at the
Long Island lodge will be in town
with all her old friends.

and modern science, besides every
thing that can be attained with
money, is being utilized to help the

golf at the Onwentsia club at Lake

arriving in the Long Island next July
will be the most important child in
economic dominance that ever got
its name into Chicago newspapers.
Marshall Field EL, when he be
comes 50 years of age, will be the
owner of a fortune of at least $350,
