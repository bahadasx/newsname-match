BEFORE STATE BOARD
St. Paul, Minn., May 1.Shades
of Indians who have passed, rose be
fore the Minnesota State Investment

Were the loans granted, the secur

pay the loan would be on territory
Indians ceded to the United States.
Whether such security can be ac
cepted and whether such taxation
can be made was to be told to L. A.

the board. Smith's previously ex
pressed opinion is not to give loans
where there is a shadow of doubt as
