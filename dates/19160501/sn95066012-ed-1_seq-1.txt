SOME INTERESTING CORSETS
The E. L. Nichols Store Has Relies of
Women's Dress on Exhibition
In connection with their present
showing of corset styles, the K. L.
Nichols stoie have an interesting win
dow display at their Main street store
of corsets and accessories used over a
century a no.
Hie main relic is a pair of corsets
worn lli years ago by a lady of the
Olin family. The stays are made ot
wood covered on the outside by un
bleached linen and on the inside by
tld. They will weigh five times what
the average corset of the present day
will weigh.
Another interesting exhibit consists
of thiee wooden ttavs, whittled by
hand from walnut which were used in
place of corsets by women who could
not afford tiie luxury of the latter.
These are about (10 years old. Many
elderly womin now living can remem
ber when wooden stays were used, of
home manufacture, instead of pur
chasing the more expensive bodices.
Saturday a person, wh: was inter
ned in the display brought in a piece
of flat wood about three inches wide,
10 inches long and an eighth of an
inch thick, who stated that such lum
ber was worn a hundred years ago by
the dudes of the period under their
shirt fronts to keep the garments
from "bunching up'' on their manly
osoms. The relic was blind carved
with fantastic resigns and had been
the property of a sea captain in the
early part of the Ifllh etntury.

"IN OLD VERMONT"
Colonial Play to Be Given Tomorrow
Evening.
The play "In Old Vermont'' which
which will be given Tuesday evening
in Library hall is most distinctive and
novel. Written by one of the best
novelists of the day who is at the same
time a member of one of the edd famil
ies of Pennington county, is a master
piece in itself and at the same time is
full of local interest and atmosphere
for Pennington people.
At the close of the revolution Ver
mont existed as an independent re
public with a legislature of its own
but the time came when even Green
Mountain Hoys felt as Kllmore Allen,
nephew of the famous Ethan Allen and
one of the chief characters of the
play expressed it "that from all I hear,
this man from Virginia, General Wash
ington is a pretty good man to follow.
We've got to cast our lot with some
body because if we don't, the other
countries will eat us ui alive. I
shouldn't be surprised if both the
United States and Canada should grow-
to be a whole sight bigger'u Vermont
and then where'd we be."
The play endeavors to give an ac
curate picture of life in those days
when wolves stole the pigs and it was
told as a matter of news that it had
been found possible for "white folks
to livo even way out in York state
where the Mohawks come from."
The' log e-abirr in which the scene is
laid has been made specially for this
occasion out of real Vermont spruce
and all the details have been corres
pondingly worked out. The music will
be furnished by stringed instruments
according to the old custom before the
days of pianos, much of it being tradi
tional in Pennington county. The
play too, is rich in true Vermont
humor and every detail has been made
perfect through the excellent coaching
of Mrs. Arthur lClliot. The cast is as

Grannie; Raker, a loyal subject of King

POPE FEARS A BREAK
But Hopes America Will Keep Out of
War and Aid Peace.
Pome, April 2!'. The Pope is follow
ing closely every stage in the contro
versy between America and Germany,
but js adhering strictly to a policy of
neutrality, lie has not expressed any
opinion regarding the merits of the dis
pute, much less bad he used or will
use his influence on either side. Ills
Holiness, however, Is gravely preoc
cupied. In the first place, because he
is relying on the Influence of America
which he has described as being pre
eminent among the neutral nations, to
move when an opportunity conies lor"
peace; second, because a rapture of
diplomatic relations would hinder the
magnificent American work on behalf
of sufferers In tin war, especially dip
lomatic work on behalf of the prison
ers. In this connection I am informed
that, in the case of a rupture, the Pope
will endeavor to organize more thor
oughly the existing activity of Catholic
Bishops throughout Europe to safe
guard the wellbcing of prisoners in the
concentration camps.
