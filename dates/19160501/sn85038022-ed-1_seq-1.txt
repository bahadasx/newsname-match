SUITS
AND COATS
The best we have over had at their respective prices. This shoiJd be understood and expected. It
is a poor business indeed which cannot show improvement from year to year. Contrary to many prophecies
these new suits and coats, although different (and we think better) in style, are not freakish. Lack of dyes
has not as yet resulted in a meagre assortment of colors. Nor have we found it necessary to advance prices.
We are confident you will be pleased with an inspection of them. Coats $5.00 to $17.50. Suits $15.00 to
$35.00.
