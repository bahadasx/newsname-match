It is with no small pride that The Star, the only Seattle daily paper which dared
to advocate woman suffrage in this state when it was adopted in 1910, today
echoes the sentiment of the entire state in declaring that woman suffrage has

It is our sincere wish and hope that the object sought by the Congressional
Union—equality of suffrage thruout the nation—shall be speedily brought about.
