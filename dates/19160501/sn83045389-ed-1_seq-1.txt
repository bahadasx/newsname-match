The report of tho American repre

status of the conference.

That General Ohregon in yesterday'?

be ' onM rued as an ultimatum detnand

From stray bits of information it
appears that yesterday's conference
ended with the queution of withdrawal
of the United States troops still upper
most in the minds of the Mexican con
ferees. They are understood to have,
tried to impress upon the American
representatives the claim that political
conditions In Mexico are such that they
cannot be responsible for eventuali
ties resulting from continued occupa
tion of Mexican soil by American col
um UP.
In view of the already expressed at
titude. of the Americans that they were
unable to discuss any other question
than co-operation of tho two armies
in dispersing the various bandit organ
izations. the next step was to attempt
lr reach a basi* on which both .sidea
ntigi.i meet.

Washington's answer is expected to
divulge whether such a basis can b$
established.
.In some quarters to-night there was
a disposition to believe that the next
conference would deal with the ques
tion of withdrawal, and that so far
as the American conferees are. concern
ed. the subject will he approached with
reserve. It is pointed oui that there
has been no disposition by the Ameri
can government to consider the mission
of General Pershing's columns as hav
ing been ended.
It is argued that the United States
might consent to relinquish the prob
lem of tho Villa pandits to the forces
oi the de facto government, but that,
pending a successful completion of this
task, the American troops will con
tinue to remain in the State of Chi
huahua. the hotbed of the Villa band
its.
News arriving here to-day, indicat
ing that there had been no let-up in
the southward rush of supplies for
fieneral Pershing's men, bolstered up
thisr belief.
There la nothing in the atmosphere
of either K1 Paso or Juarez to Indi
cate thnt any crisis has been reached
\ In the. negotiations. All of the prin
cipals. Mexican and American, seem
optimistic.
General Ohrogon expressed the belief
thai the conference, would be ended in
time fAr him to start his return trip
t<. Mexico City by Tuesday or Wednes
day.

WITH HIS AO VIS KUS
General Ohregon to-day held a Jong
conference with his advisers in his
private ear. but nothing was announced
regarding It. T-ater, it was stated that
\ the Minister of War had received a
telegram from General Candido ARui
lar. Minister of Foreign Relations at
Mexico City, stating that General Oh
regon had been quoted In certain
American papers as saying that ho;
"had 40.000 men ready to force the re
tirement of tho American troops across
the border." The telegram added:
"Instructions of tho first chief are
that the declarations made by you be I

General Ohregon immediately wired
a reply, declaring he had "never mado
or thought of making such a state

would lilie to see the public lands and :
water-power bill passed before the !
Democratic convention, and this is giv

The general speeding-up effort alms I

some hope for getting through in .Tuly,

tent themselves with as large a vote
'.as possible against strictly administra

The Democratic program for the
House as finally decided upon after
much discussion is expocted to be con

quarters is that an agreement may be
reached, whereby it will be unneces
sary to bring in a rule on the bill.
The Senate still has rural credit leg

is expected within a few days, after

agreement on the size of the regular

If the German reply has been
drafted, official information on the sub
ject is* lacking. That a note will be
sent by Berlin In preference to In
structions to fount von Bernstorff. the
German ambassador, Is considered In
German quarters to be certain.
The American note calls upon Ger
many to Immediately "declare and ef
fect" an abandonment of existing sub
marine practices. In German quarters ,
it Is intimated that it Is quite pos
j sible the Berlin Rovoriimcnt formal-|
| Iv will so "declare and effect," and
qualify the action with a statement
that the declaration is to remain ef
fective pending: final agreement over
jthe principles Involved. There Is no
I indication whether such action would
j meet with the approval of the United I
States.
XO DRFINITK INFORMATION*
CO.NCI5UMXG TJXIi: OF ItKPI/V
There is no definite information here
regarding the time when the reply may
be expected. It is felt In diplomatic
and official quarters, however, that It
hardly will bo received before the
middle of the week at the earliest.
One official, who has consistently
held to the view that a break will be
avoided, made the significant state
ment to-day that Germany already has
complied with one of the basic demands
of the American note.
I The fact that there has not been
an official report of a single subma
rine attack involving American lives
or interests since the President dis
patched his note to Germany was evi
dence. this ottlcinl said, that. Germany
has "effected an abandonment" of all i
illegal submarine warfare
It has been apparent the last few
days that the administration has held
the view that Germany complied with
one of the President's demands by
suspending the submarine campaign. In
which it had been engaged since
March I. This is believed to account
for tho administration's willingness
to give Germany ample time to reply i
to the note, although an "Immediate" !
reply was demanded at the time. |
The tension apparent In oflicial cir
cles immediately after the President's
note was sent to Germany lias been
almost entirely relieved. The White
Mouse and Stato Department have re
ceived advices from Berlin of such e?
couraging nature that they are con
vinced Berlin wishes to avoid a break
