CAUSE IS LOST
?}
Four Hundred and Fifty Rebels I
March Out under the White |

James Connolly, One of the
Leaders, is a Prisoner in
Castle and Wounded.
A??OCIATKO PNCafl)
LONDON, May 3.?Official an
nouncement was made Monday that
all the rebel leaders in Dublin had
surrendered.
General Maxwell, the British com
mander. announced Monday night
lhat Tjie O'Heilly was among the
prinsoners. He also stated repor's
lrom country districts showed that'
everywhere quiet was being restored
and that the rebels were coming by
groups to surrender, especially at
Ashbourne and Enniscorthy.
The fate of the prisoners is now in
the hands of the government which
possesses very wide powers under'
martial law. Snipers who remain p.-,
calcitrant In all probability will boj
dealt with very severely.
The Irish commander, J. H. Pierce, j
who 1b now a prisoner, is a school-1
master. Before being captured he took
a most active part in the uprising and
was looked to as the head of the move
ment.
Many of the prisoners were cap
tured red-handed with weapons. Hun
dreds of others are being detained on
suspicion of complicity in the out
break. One man was caught in a
chimney from which he had been snip
ing for four days and nights. He held
a position of trust in the office of a
steamship company.
The casualties up to the present are
said to be very numerous although the j
troops have not suffered as heavily as
might have been expected from the
nature of the fighting.
The! rwork of clearing houses from i
cellar to roof is very risky but they \
go in without hesitation. The rebels
suffered severely and hundreds of1
peaceful citizens were killed or.
wounded by them.
RANK AND FILE ALSO
CONFESS TO LOST COURSE
'?Y A1BOCIATCO rniHSi
LONDON. May 1?Rebels of the
rank and file followed their leaders
Monday morning and confessed the
cause of the Irish republic was lost
by laying down their arms at the foot'
of Parnell monument in Sackville
street and surrendering to British
troops. About 450 of them, who had
fought since Monday in this central
area, marched out from their strong- ;
holds under the white flag and gave 1
themselves up. A few lrreconcll&blfcs
continued sniping from lairs diffi
cult to locate on rooTs or among
rafters of buildings nearby.
Soon after a rebel lieutenant wear
ing a heather green uniform and car
rying a white flag came in with a
guard of ten men from the adjoining
county of Meath to learn the truth
about rumors of a general surrender.
The party marched off to the castle
nnd learned from J. H. Pierce, who 1
was named provisional president of
the Irish republic, that the movement
had collapsed, and was advised to re-1
Hist no longer. The lieutenant and |
his escort then started out to parley
with the rebels in the country dis
tricts in an effort to induce them to
Jay down their arms.
James Connolly, one of the leaders
of the uprising, is said by government
officials, to be a prisoner wounded in
the castle.
This morning the streets were full
WANTS TO CORRESPOND.
Mrs. Anna Karns, of Fair
Hope, Pa., or at leant that is
the way the letter reads, writes
to the Telegram as follows:
"I am a widow 40 years old
with dark hair and eyes and
light complexion and 1 would
like to correspond with a wid
ower or bachelor about 45 or
50 years old. I am five feet
five inches tall and I weigh
111 pounds."
of curious persons who were glad to
have the opportunity to be about af
ter their long detention in their
homes during which they were de-!
prived of food until the authorities
made provision for them. The sup
plies thus brought in were ample.
As the correspondont approached
the castle a party of more than 100 1
captured members of the Sinn Fein
marched by under escort toward i
Richmond jail, where more than 700 |
are now held. Many of the men were;
in green uniform. One wore the uni
form of the Irish volunteers and oth
ers were In civilian clothes. Numbers
of them were wounded and suffering
but most of them held up their heads
defiantly.
The soldiers escorting them were!
men who had fought all through the
uprising and were even more bitter
against their rebellious fellow coun
trymen than the troops brought over,
from England. This feeling seems
to be shared by moat of the popula-'
tion of Dublin.

GRAND CHAPLAIN
HOLDS MEETINGS,
For Boys' Organization Which
Are Largely Attended and
Greatly Appreciated.
The Rev. D. H. Jameson, of Cincin
nati. came, the people heard and
much han been accomplished alon^j
the line of solving the boy problem,
nnd knowing how to live the Christian |
life. The keynote seems to be "ser.:
Wee" and definite work for all to do. I
The Saturday night meeting of the j
boys was a success. More than sixty
of the seventy members were in at-|
tendance. Grand Chaplain Jameson1
was present.
The regular first degree work was \
given in nice order, all then ad
journed to the Sunday school room
whore a semi-banquet was served to
the members, visitors, fifteen honor
pry members and the Northview
Chapter, which came over in a body.
A goodly number of mothers were
also present.
Mr. Jameson talked to the boys of
their fraternal organization and ot
the sacredness of the work they were
initiated into. Then the two Sunday
schools addressed heard many things
to their advantage.
The sermon at the Christian
church was one of the most inspirlu ?*.
giving all who were present a brief
vision of the value and the dignity
0' true decipleship.
The mass meeting in the afternoon
at the First Presbyterian church
\ rought out the details of the Kappi
Sigma Pi work from its very inception
VP to the presen ttime of 7,000 mem
lers, of the seven countries which ate
organized, of Its many benefits and
advantages ove rail other such organ
isations for boys that are now in th*
field, forty-seven in number.
The ministers present showed
n.uch Interest and are planning active
assistance.
Dr. Moore sang a beautiful solo,
and the Kappl Sigma Pi boys sang
their own organization song.
The night service at the First Bap
tist church was splendid. An address
on "Is It Well With the Child?or
F.oy?" held the closest attention of
the large audience and the close of
this address came too soon as a'!
were held by the beauty, idealism and
true fitness, as brought out by this
man, who ao thoroughly understand*?
human nature, not only the boy, but
also the grown-up man, and who is
to surely a man who walks close with
Cod.
The Kappi Sigma PI boys attended
oach of these three services in a body
pnd royally supported their devoted
national leader.
The Rev. Mr. Jameson is to meot
the ministerial union this afternoon.
The Kappl Sigma Pi boys are to bo

tional magazine. At 4:30 he will
talk to the girls and women of the
girls' organization. To night he will
go to the Northview Chapter, com
pleting a full two-days of faithful ser
vice for the boys.
The ltev. Mr. Jameson is much
pleased with all he has seen and
heard here?especially with the bo/?
and their splendid chaplain.

and tired of the actions of certain
young couples who take night Joy
rides along there and make nuisances
of themselves with their hilarity and
immoral conduct. The automobile
bearing the occupants who were held

side of the road for a short time Sun
day night so that a slight repair
could be made and also for the pur
pose of being turned around for the
return trip. While the machine stop
ped all the occupants got out for a
few minutes. The man who held
them up made no attempt at robbery.
He merely warned them to move
along.
The woman occupant of the ma
chine was so frightened and nervous
over the incident that a doctor had
to attend her on her arrival home in
the city. The names of the occupants
were withheld at their request.
