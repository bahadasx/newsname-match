BOND MIS CITY'S
Fate of Columbia's School
System Rests With Voters,
Is Declaration.
MUST HAVE SUPPORT
Defeat of Proposition To
morrow Ma' Mean Half
Dav Sessions, One Holds.
The proposed $Uu,0uU bond issue for
liipro etnoiits in Columbia's schools
will he oted on tomorrow, and mem
bers of the school board and Superin
tendent .1. H McPherson, feel that
it is essential that all those inter
ested must turn out and work for
the cause tomorrow.
"lts past the school board now. It
is simply up to the voters," said S F
Conley, a member of the board. "The
board has put off this issue to the
latest possible date, striving to keep
down taes, but it is no longer possi
ble to aold the issue."
"We do not intend to electioneer
these bond propositions through,"
s.iid r. W Niedcrmeyer. another
member "We hae been holding off
for a long time, but the issue is so
urgent that it can no longer bo
avoided The negro school building
is ready to tumble down, and the at
tendance at maiij of the ward schools
exceeds the seating capacity.
Hard Time if Bonds Fail.
"What will we do if the bond issue
fails? Well, we're hoping hard that
it won't fail. If it does, there are
such expedients as half-day sessions
and the like We hope, however, that
we will not have to resort to such
unsatisfactory tactics. They're hard
on the children and patrons, and
they're a bad advertisement for any
town Columbia voters have been
extremely liberal in the matter of
si hool equipment in the past, and it
is to be hoped they will not fall down
at this time.
"The biggest danger lies in the
fait that the bond issue must be di
vided up into five propositions in
stead of being voted on as a whole.
There will be the ?35,000 proposition
for the negro school, which is the
largest because it must include both
grade and high school equipment.
The $2G,000 proposition is for the
new ward school on the north side,
where congestion is heaviest; $12,000.
to buy additional grounds at the Jef
ferson School, where crowded quar
ters are inconvenient; $12,000, for
improvement to building and grounds
at the Lee School, where it is essential
to increase from four to six rooms;
$."..000 for improvements at the Hen
Ion School.
Increases Hale Only 10 Cents.
Mr. Niedermeyer explained that it
would increase the present tax rate
only it) tents "The present bonded in
debtedness is $110,000; $10,000 is now
in the treasury ready to be paid on
September 1, which is the next date
on which the bonds may be decreased.
The board proposes to issue these
bonds as 10-20's that Is, with a mini
mum of ten years and a maximum of
twenty. This will give us an op
portunity to pay off the $100,000 re
maining after September 1 in the
next ten years, before any of the pro
posed $1)0,000 bonds become due. A
10-cent increase means so very little.
Tor example: property in Columbia
is assessed at about 40 per cent of
its value. Therefore, a man owning
a $2,500 home, assessed at $i,vuu
would only suffer an increase of $1 a
year by this bond issue. May the
voters tomorrow be liberal!"
Superintendent McPhcrson, like Mr.
Neidermeycr, thought it was up to
the voters. "Now is the most oppor
tune time to vote on such a propo
sition," he said. "Money is plenti
ful, people want bonds, and we will
be able to sell them lower now than
will be possible if they are voted la
ter The issue is acute, and the situa
tion must be remedied. I urge ev
eryone interested in the success and
progress of Columbia's schools to let
nothiiiir stand in the way of their
voting for the bond issue tomorrow."
Dr. A W. Kampschmidt said that it
was one of those propositions which
had no negative side. It was so evi
dent that there seemed to be no ar
gument on the positive side. He also
urged the voters to appear at the
polls tomorrow.
Jloclor Coh' Makes a Plea.
Said Dr. J. B. Cole, "Our schools are
crowded to their full capacity. Since
the first day of last September ninety
new families have moved into Colum
bia, with nearly two hundred chil
dicn. "Suppose the bond issue was de
feated. What would we do with the
natural increase and the two hun
dred children who will probably move
in by fall?
"The school bonded indebtedness
now is $110,000. One-tenth of this
is now available for refund The
whole amount will be paid off in ten
y ears
"The school board proved to our
satisfaction that 10 cents on the $100
of present valuation would carry the
whole proposed $90,000 bond Issue,
pay Interest and provide for a sink
ing fund The bonds will be 10-20 is
sue and will bear not more than 4 1-2
per cent.
"This money will be spent in five
places in our city. A large proportion
will be spent for labor and material
in Columbia."
