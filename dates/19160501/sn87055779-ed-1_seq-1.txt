LONDON. May 1. All the
leader of the Irish rebels in
Dublin have surrendered to the
British military force.-, the war
office announced today.
Ofllclal advices regarding the
surrender of the Sinn Fein
chief were rocelved by the war
office from Gen. Sir John Max
well, Hritish commander In Ire
land, this morning.
International News Service:
LONDJN, May 1. Although Peter
Pearce, t;elf-proclaimed "provisional
president, of the republic of Ireland."
has ordered his followers to lay
down their arms, fighting is still in
progress at a number of points.
Information received here today
from Kingstown stated that the
rebels in Dublin had almost, ex
hausted their supply of ammunition
and that the lighting there had
grown down to intermittent sniping.
Iarge bodies of troops, supported
by tield artillery and machine guns,
were ser.t to Knniscorthy. 12 miles
from Wexford, where the rebels re
fused to surrender.
Tiiroughtout Dublin and the sub
urbs the supply of food has become
' so low that Ioor faniilies rirt threat -
i mr military purposes anu no iuuu-
stuffs were sent Into the Irish cap
ital. I '
In otllcial circles it is claimed that
the revolt of the Sinn Feiners has
been crushed. However, military
law will be maintained in Ireland
until order has been restored.
The declaration that German cub
marines were used as filibusters to
land arms in Ireland is borne out by
the statement of a British officer in
Dublin that two German officers
were found among the slain in the
streets of the Irish capital. Tt is
supposed that they too had been
landed on the Irish coast by a t'-boat
Almost 1,000 rebel prisoners are

among .nem many women, me
principal woman captive is Countess
MarkievPz. Women took a prom
inent iart in the uprising. The
Kingstown correspondent of the
Chronicle says that several Knglish
otlicers were shot in the back by
women. One officer wa.s killed by
a woman who struck him over the
head with the butt of a rifle.
I,n Near 2 Millions.
It 13 Impossible to stimate accur
ately the loss throughout the zones
of fighting in the Houthe.'Mtern and
western pnrts of Ireland, but it is
expected to ejected $20.000i0.
There was much looting. One cor
respondent describes scenes in Dub-
! lin In which poor women, whose rat:-
ged clothing was partly hidden by
greasy bawls, wore diamond tiaras'
in their hair. These had been stolen
from jewelry shops into which the
rebels broke to secure material for
street barricades.
Whether Jas. Connolly, the 'com
ma nder-in-chief of the republican
army," if dead or only wounded is
not officially known. He was orig
inally reported to have heen killed.
; hut a Vater dispatch sairl that he had
1 he-en woJnded in the thigh. This
dispatch added that Connolly, after
his wound had been bmnd uj, con
tinued to direct the operations of Iiis
men until he "became unconscious
from pai:i and kfs of blood.
Although no official figures as to
casualties have been given out the
advices from the zones of hzhting
are now beginning to speak of
"enormous losses." It is regarded as
a certairty that the casualties on
both sids up to Saturday were Jn
excess of .'f. 0.
