-r-After Jays and niglits of tlc.nl
l(X"kcil discussion,.-, the house and
senate conferees on the army re
organization bill have virttial'jr
agreed upon a plan which will give
' the countr' an aijny of 180.0UU in
' ieajce times. -
With the plans for expansion pro
vided in the Giambcrlain bill as
' passed by the senate, the f cheme
which is now being agreed upon
will produce 250,000 mcif when the
organizations are filled to war
strength. f-".-r; '
It is apparent that the : "bigger
army-.- plan as provided , in the
Chamberlain bill is winning its way
as against the Hay bill, which was
passed by the house and would give
.aa army peace strength of about
140,000,, ;.-;-;' ;-';f;'V;-.''.:
; The Qiambcrlain bill original!
provided a' peace strengtlj- within
five years of 178.C00 men of all

strength brrgmally. was to' be 225.
100. The army would consist of
(o infantry, 25 cavalry and 21-field

tlie staff and other special corp.-
nul the coast artillery. '
