DUBLIN. May 1. It Is officially an
nounced that all the rebel leaders in
Dublin have surrendered. The rebels,
rank and file followed the example of
their leaders who confessed the cause
of the Irish republic was lost by sur
rendering to the British troops. About
450 ofo them who fought a week in
the central area marched from the
stronghold under a white flag, and
gave themselves up.
Sniping is still reported in some sec
tions, however. Others came from the
outside to learn If the report of the
surrender was true. They were Inform
ed by J. II. Pearce, who was named
provisional president, that the move
ment had collapsed. James Connolly,
one of the leaders, said to be wounded.
Is a prisoner In Dublin castle.
Pearce Is a school master and look
ed upon as head of the revolt, was
wounded in the leg and now Is a pris
oner. Reports stiite the greatest dis
turbances outside of Dublin occurred
in the county Meath. At last accounts
armed rebels continue terrorizing the
countryside.
Only a few girders and window
frames of some houses remain on
Sackvllle street and adjacent thorough
fares. The postoffice is merely a smoulder
ing framework. The desolation and
destruction showed how severe was
the fighting. Every window of the
Four Courts was shattered. Rebels
held the building nearly a week. Law
books and furniture were used to bar
rirudn the windows.
