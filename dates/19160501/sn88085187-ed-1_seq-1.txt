BURIES NEW-BORN BABE ALIVE
"When the Brown Man Comes
Without Warning"
On Saturday The Times called attention to the rcainess of the Japanese menace to our national safe
' ty in our present state of unpreparedness, and urged a specific remedy—better coast defenses.
That this problem is challenging the attention of the east as well as of the west and that it is no
jingoist bugaboo is indicated by the appearance in the conservative New York Tribune of April 24 of an
editorial article headed "When the Brown Man Comes Without Warning," in which a similar massaf/e
is voiced.
The Tribune accompanies its article with a statement that its accuracy "is vouched for by a ranking
officer in the United States army and a ranking officer in the United States navy." It says:

FATHER
GEORGE
LIVING!
George Washington Is just ia
much alive today as lie was when
he assumed office as the first
president of the I'nited States.
Deputy Prosecutor Selden prov
ed this today by citing Daniel
Webster's definition of memory,
to the effect Hint it is a quality
of the mind which retains
thoughts of events and persons.
Attorney Pendleton, for Paul
llaffer, socialist charged with
libelling the memory of the fath
er of our country, in his opening
address to the jury claimed It waa
impossible to libel a dead man
who had no living relatives.
Joab floes on Ktand.
The slate Immediately con
nected Washington with living
persons by showing that they
were entitled to a sacred memory
of all public heroes.
"I think that the court will
agree that Washington no doubt
existed,'' Selden argued. "Im
mediately upon his death his
memory was passed on down the
generations as a worthy charac
ter.
"It would be all right for a
person to attack his public life,
but I, ;ii lei- attacked his private
life. He held his memory to
ridicule and hatred."
Col. Albert K. .Joab was the
first witness called to the stand
by the defense.
Never Saw Mini.
"Have you ever seen Washing
ton?" Pendleton asked.
"The colonel admitted he
hadn't.
"Are you any relation to lilm?"
he questioned.
"No blood relation, that 1 know
of," said the colonel, "1 haven't,
traced it down."
"Describe the tensation you
had when you read the article,'"
counsel continued.
"I felt as if I had been slapped
In the face. My face got red
with righteous indignation. I
did what, every loyal American
citizen would have done."
When asked to deacrlbe the
difference between a mental slap
and a physical, the colonel color
ed and turned to the court sput
tering he was not there to give
Knglish lesson*.
Hadn't Bead 'Km All.
When asked If had read any
history on Washington, he said
he had read many authoritative
histories exhaustively and re
peatedly. Although he did not
see anything detrimental to
Washington's name, he admitted
there were parts that moved him
to tears.
Pendleton read a number of
references which the colonel ad
mitted he had only partially read
or had passed up in their entirety.
"1 suppose you don't consider
them authorities because you
haven't read them?" Pendleton
ventured.
"That is about It," loab shot
hack.
"You are the only person In
terested in thi* prosecution,
aren't you, colonel?"
"I slum id say not. I have had
countless letters and telephone
rails and expressions of congrat
ulations by word and mouth from
Indignant citizens.
