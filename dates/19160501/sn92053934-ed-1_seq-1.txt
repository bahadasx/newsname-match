PRESIDENT REFUSES
Wilson, It Is Reported, Has
No Intention Doing So
at Present.
El Paso, Tex., May 1.
Major General Frederick
Funston announced shortly
before noon today that only
one more conference would
be held with the Mexican
representatives on the mili
tary questions now existing
between this country and
Mexico.
Washington, May I. Additional
instructions sent to Genera! Scott
and Funston today by Secretary
B;iker after conference with Presi
dent Wilson and Secretary Lans
inc are understood to make plain
that -whatever is agTeed upon at
the conference with General Oh re
gno. General farranza's minister
of war, mnst not be based on any
immediate recall of General Persh
ing's forces.
General Scott probably win
point out to the Carranza war min
ister that the de facto government
is threaten etfTty factional enemies'
within its own border who wonld
welcome an opportunity to rise
atrainst it. If the I nited State
were compelled to go into Mexico
in considerable force to make cer
tain the security of its own borders
aarainst bandit raids that opportu
nity inisrht be prevented.
While no demands have been
presented by either side it is un
derstood, however, that General
Ohrecon laid soch stress upon the
withdrawal of the American forces
that General Scott felt unable to
proceed until he had advised the
administration officials.
Washington, May 1. After an ex
change of messages between General
Scott and the war department on his
conference Saturday with General
Obregon, Mexican minister of war. of
ficials said today the negotiations up
to date have been "satisfactory."
While General Obregon has urged that
the American troops be withdrawn.
President Wilson, they said, has no
intention of granting the request at
present and is hopeful that an agree
ment will be reached for cooperation
between American and Mexican troops
in the pursuit of Villa and other ban
dits. Final proposals have not yet been
reported in the border conferences, it
wa3 authoritatively stated at the war
department A long code dispatch
from Genera! Scott arrived early to
day. Secretary Baker of the war de
partment expected to send supplemen
tary advices to General Scott to reach
him if possible before his second con
ference with General Obregon.
While it was officially admitted that
General Obregon had "suggested"
withdrawal from Mexico of the United
States expedition-, officials said these
overtures had not been in the form of
a demand and that no peremptory or
unalterable position had been taken
by either side. General Scott, it was
explained, had made counter sugges
tions to General Obregon, proposing
cooperative military measures.
That the conferences have not
reached a deadlock was also stated
on official authority. No measures
have been taken on behalf of the Unit
ed States, it was asserted, which pre
ci jfle an amicable settlement.
Mexican Ambassador Arredondo

Kl Paso, Texas, May 1. Resumption
of the Scott-Funston-Obregon confer

tary problem in Mexico may not be un
dertaken until late today or possibly

Binibtration will have had time to di
gest the reports that have been sent
to Washington by the American repre
sentatives of the war department
here.
Generals Scott and Funston with
their aides worked far into the night
preparing data and reports and a last
code message was dispatched to the

Liner Patria
Is Target of
Sub Torpedo
New York, May 1. The French passenger-steamer
Patria which arrived
here today from Naples and Palermo
reported that on her last outward voy
age at 10 a. m., April 5, she was the
target of a submarine torpedo attack
in the Mediterranean. The torpedo
missed the ship by about ten feet, the
officers said.
The Patria at the time of her escape
had 38 passengers aboard, of whom at
least one was an American named
Vincent Howell, according to the pas
senger list for the trip.
The Patria was passing Cape Spart
avento, the southerly part of Sardinia
and running at full speed. The sub
marine did not show itself, the officers
said- The Patria was not armed at
the time.
This is the second time that the
Patria has escaped destruction by a
torpedo. On her arrival here March
16 she reported that she had narrowly
missed being hit by a torpedo off the
coast of Tunis, March 1.
TRYING TO SPEED
UP LEGISLATURE
Another Effort Being Made by Demo
crats In Both Houses to Hurry
Remainder of Program.
Washington, May 1. Another move
to "speed up" the legislative program
in congress in order that adjournment
may be had as soon as possible was
started today by democratic leaders
of both houses. -The aim is to get the
more important features of the pend
ing slate enacted into law before the
national political conventions and in
this the minority in congress is ex
pected to cooperate.
The calling u,oX the Philippine in
dependence bill under "a special rule
providing for its disposition in one day
marked the beginning of the "clean
up" campaign in the house. With this
bill disposed of it is planned to hurry
up action on other measures including
the Porto Rican, District of Columbia,
diplomatic and consular, shipping,
fortifications, rural credits, naval, and
revenue bills.
The senate steering committee
meets today to formulate a new legis
lative program as the upper body's
part in the "speed up" process. It is
planned to take up an appropriation
and defense measures as soon as they
are ready. Meanwhile, however, con
servative and campaign publicity bills
as well as other matters are awaiting
disposition-
GERARD'S REPORT
EXPECTED HOURLY
Washington Officials Think It May
Forecast Reply of Germany to
Submarine Protest-
Berlin. May 1. At least another
day's deliberations at headquarters
may be expected before the German
answer to the American note is de
cided on.
This is deduced from the fact that
Ambassador Gerard telegraphed last
night. It was uncertain when he would
be able to return to Berlin. Mr. Ger
ard is the guest of Emperor William
at meals.
Washington, May 1. Secretary Lans
ing said today he had no new dis
patches from Germany bearing on the
submarine situation and that Ambassa
dor Gerard had not reported on his
conference with Emperor William. A
report from Gerard is expected hourly
and officials think it probably will fore
cast the Germany reply.
Information received from German
sources is to the effect that the Berlin
government has been considering re
plying to the American demand for the
immediate abandonment of present
methods of submarine warfare with an
offer to have its submarines operate,
at least temporarily only as cruisers,
against enemy merchant ships. Ger
man officials are said to have expressed
themselves as being favorable toward
the plan. The state department, so far
as is known, has no information on
the subject.
If the German reply has been draft
ed, official information on the subject
is lacking. That a note will be sent
by Berlin, in preference to instructions
to Count von Bemstorff, the German
ambassador, is considered in German
quarters to be certain. It is known
that the latter method of procedure at
one time was considered by the Ger
man government. The idea was said
to have been abandoned, however, be
cause German officials in Berlin felt
a note would serve all purposes more
completely.
There is no definite information here
regarding the time when the reply may
be expected.
IRISH REVOLT
BROKEN; REB
FORCES QUIT
Leaders and Rank and File
of Rebellion Surrender
to the British.
DUBLIN IS IN CHAOS
Smoldering Ruins and Shat
tered Buildings Are Scars
of Week's War.
London, May 1, (1:45 p.
m.) Official announcement
was made this afternoon
that all the rebel leaders in
Dublin had surrendered.
Dublin, Sunday evening, April 30,
via London. May 1, (10:20 a. m.)
Rebels of the rank and file followed
the example of their leaders this
morning and confessed the cause of
the Irish republic was lost by laying
down their arms at the foot of the
Parnell monument in Sackvillc street
and surrendering to British troops.
About four hundred and fifty of them
who had fought since Monday in this
central area marched out from their
strongholds under the white flag and
gave themselves up. A few irrecon
cilablcs continued sniping from lairs
difficult to locate on roofs or among
rafters of buildings nearby.
Soon afterward a rebel lieutenant
came in with a guard of 10 men from
the adjourning county of Meath to
learn the truth about the rumors of a
general surrender."" The party learned
from J. H. Pearce, who was named
provisional president of the Irish re
public, that the movement had col
lapsed. The lieutenant and his escort
then started out to parley with the
rebels in the country districts in an
effort to induce them to lay down their
arms.
Report Rebel Leader Wounded.
James Connolly, one of the leaders
of the uprising, is said by government
officials to be a prisoner, wounded, in
the castle.
Town in Chaotic State.
A correspondent of the Associated
Press visited the entire area of the dis
turbance today. The desolation and
destruction showed how severe was
the fighting. Havoc however, looks
mote extensive than it actually is ow
ing to the amount of debris.
From headquarters down near the
entrance to Phoenix Park, on North
Circular road to the four courts dis
trict every window of the law courts
has been shattered.
The rebels had held the building for
a week. Valuable law reference books
and furniture were utilized to barri
cade windows and through the inter
stices betwen the bulky volumes the
rebels sniped without cessation and
were fired on in turn until they were
compelled to evacuate the premises.
Shows Battle Scars.
Houses all around were dented with
bullet marks. Some of them were bar
ricaded with thick oaken planks which
were marked with bullet holes. Over
Wine Tavern bridge there were simi
lar scenes.
This morning the streets were full
of curious persons who were glad to
have the opportunity to be about after
their long detention in their homes
during which they were deprived of
food until the authorities made pro
visions for them. The supplies thus
brought in were ample,
Down Cork Hill and King Edward
streets strong guards of troops are
still in evidence and every passerby is
challenged.
Snipers Still Busy. '
The city hall had been occupied for
several days by the rebels and even
at this time snipers in houses in the
vicinity were shooting at intervals.
As the correspondent approached
the castle a party of more than one
hundred members of the Sinn Fein
marched by under escort toward Rich
mond jail, where more than seven
hundred are now held.
Many of the men were in green uni
forms. One wore the uniform of the
Irish volunteers and others were in
civilian clothes. Numbers of them
were wounded and suffering but most
of them held up their heads defiantly.
The 6oldiers escorting them were
men who had fought all through the
uprising and were bitter against their
rebellious fellow countrymen. This
feeling seems to be shared by most
of the population of Dublin.
Great Damatre Done.
Great damage was done in Sackville
street and adjacent thoroughfare
such as Middle Abbey, Abbey Mary
and Henry streets; Only a few girders
and window frames of some houses
remain. Along the east side of Sack-
Survivor of
Sea Tragedy
Tells Story
Halifax, N. S., May L The fate of
the captain and crew of the British
ship Suffolk, caught in the ice in the
White Sea, while on her way to Arch
angel shortly before Christmas, with
details of suffering from cold, hunger
and exposure, resulting in the death
of all but three men of a crew of 27
and the suicide of the ship's captain,
who, maddened by hunger and cold,
shot himself were related here today
by sailors of the New Foundland
steamer Bella Venture, just in from
Archangel. The crew of the Bella
Venture, which has been in Russian
waters more than a year, met and
talked with the three survivors only
one of whom, a Russian Finn, was
physically able to recount his adven
tures. The other two were not expect
ed to recover. The Suffolk, supposedly
having a cargo of war supplies, was
caught in the ice of the White Sea with
therst heavy freeze before the holi
days. P'ood and fuel became ex
hausted. The suffering caused many
of the men to lose their minds and
while in this state they succumbed.
vVhen only 10 survivors remained
they decided to try to reach land on
foot Taking the scanty provisions
remaining, they set forth on an SO-mile
trip across the ice. A heavy blizzard
set in and the party soon became scat
tered and lost. Only three were able
to stick together and after days of
wandering they were found by the
crew of a British ship and taken to
land.
ville street from Henry street to
O'Connell bridge the buildings are
battered beyond recognition. The post
office is merely a smouldering frame
work. The stone Young Men's Christ
ian association building on the same
side of the way was perforated by
eight shells, the Catholic club by two
and the blind institution by two.
Carry Rebel Bodies Away.
Bodies o slain rebels were hcing
carried away by soldiers, many of
them having been shot several times.
When the authorities gave orders
that the people were to be allowed to
enter the streets today some of the
poor began looting. This was stopped
at 2 o'clock when the troops cleared
the streets again and arrested every
one who did not move promptly.
Find Irish Proclamation.
In the debris was found a printed
proclamation issued in the name of
the president of the provisional gov
ernment, the text of which follows:
"The provisional government to the
citizens of Dublin:
"The provisional government of the
Irish republic salutes the citizens of
Dublin on the momentous occasion of
the proclamation of a sovereign inde
pendent Irish state now in course of
being established by Irishmen in
arms. Republican forces now hold
the lines taken up at 12 noon Easter
Monday and nowhere despite the fierce
and almost continuous attacks of Brit
ish troops have the lines been broken
through."
WILL INTERPRET
AMOS ENO'S WILL
Court Attempting to Find If $100,000 or
$7,000,000 Was Intended for
Columbia Tniversity.
New York, May 1. Whether the late
Amos E. Eno intended to leave $100,
000 or more than $7,000,000 to Colum
bia university by his will of June IS,
1915 is the question before the Surro
gate today in a will contest begun by
heirs over the division of his estate,
estimated to be worth from $15,000,000
to $19,000,000. Mr. Eno left four wills
in the last of which he bequeathed his
residuary estate to Columbia.
His heirs asserted he did not know
the extent of his fortune and that he
believed he was giving the university
less than $100,000. They also contend
that Mr. Eno was not mentally in a
condition to know how to dispose of
his estate.
The heirs who are contesting it are:
William P. Eno, Mrs. Antoinette E.
Wood, Mary E. Pinchot, GifTord Pin
chot, Amos R. E. Pinchot, Professor
Henry Lane Eno and Lady Antoinette
Graves. Each received a substantia
sura under the will they are contesting
but was remembered to a much larger
degree in a will drawn by Mr. Eno in
1914.

"Washington, May 1. A regular
army of 180,000 men at peace strength
has practically been agreed upon by
senate and house conferees on the
army bill. With the plans for expan

strength. The bill as it passed the
senate fixed the peace strength at 250,

The agreement on the size of Nthe

they could make any progress on de
