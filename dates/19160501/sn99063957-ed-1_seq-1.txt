Scott and Funston Instructed

CARRANZISTAS MUST

Tiilistas Burned Property of

at Chuiclmpa
By Carl D. Grout.
(raited Press stuff correi .ondent.)
Washington, May 1. Tie administra
tion does not intend to heed General
.Mvnrn Obregon's suggestion that the
American expedition withdraw from
Mexico.
Scott and Funston have again been
, ii'Structed not to treat with Obregon
.looking toward a withdrawal of Amer
icans. Instead, Scott must again express
the need of having Cnrranzistas co
operate with the expedition.
War Secretary Baker called on Presi
dent Wilson following the receipt of
Scott's request for more explicit in
nfruetions as to how far to go in the
next conference. Baker must have re
ceived the instructions quickly, ns his
'(inference with Wilson lasted only 10
oi': notes. '

Kl Paso, Texas, la, General Funs
ton stated that there would probably be
no session of the Obregon-Seott confer
ence todav.
mCJfm'HUoTr of- withdrawing the
American expedition froia. Mexico, upon
which depends peace or war with the de
fucto government, was tip to President
Wilson today.
A rapid fire excli.-.nge of telegram
between Secretary of War Pealter anil
Generals Hugh iScott and Fred Funs
Ion today indicated that the adminis
tration had not yet fullly decided on its
policy. Major Sample, in command at
('(ilumbus, was ordered to obtain lien
oral Pershing's opinion on the Carran
.'1a demand for an immediate with
diawal. General Scott was said to be lake
warm on the issue before his confer
en.'O with Guteral Alvaro Obregon, Car
rniigista war minister. Funston is said
to be strongly opposed to yielding to
Hie demands. Both, however, put the
decision squarely up to Washington.
tt was reported that Baker asked the
Americans how a withdrawal would af
fect the bolder region and Mexico it-ai-if.
They replied with a long code
message which it is understood contain
ed the opinion that a withdrawal
would undoubtedly lend to new border
raids.
If Scott and Funston are instructed
from Washington in time a second con
ference may be held with Obregon to
dny. Washington's reply is not expect
. ed to be a peremptory refusal of the
! Mexican demand Further conferences
ate anticipated. It is also assumed from
President Wilson's previous statements
( that the army would be withdrawn i'i
its continued existence in Mexico meant

Pro-intervention interests here gave
Scott documents to show that the Cur-
rnnzistas would not co-operate to police

' -T. 'ers because they understood that

ueral Funston dropped a significant
i 5? rk when he was told that three
i !1 paper correspondents had returned
f Mexico because they thought there
i.uuid be no more big events there.
"I think they are mistaken," he
said.
Scott and Funston worked all night
on code messages to Washington and to
General Pershing. Funston stated that
instructions from Washington received
last night were not clear in several par
ticulars. At (1 a. m. today the American envoys
asked Washington to amplify its direc
tions. The answer is not anticipated
in time for the conference with Obre
gon t oday.
"It is my personal opinion," said
Funston, "that there will be but one
more conference with Obregon and that
it will be brief."
Gather Supplies on Border.
Columbus, N. M., .way 1. Large re
serve supplies or rations and forage are
being piled along the lines of communi
cation for the American expedition in
Mexico. The quartermaster's depart
ment was most active today and Sun
day, dispatching an unusual number oT
motor trains. Fresh cavalry forces are
marching rapidly along the eommuuici
Hons southward, according to driver?
of incoming trucks. However, 1,000 in
fantrymen scheduled to leave Dubliin
were held there, the change in plans be
ing attributed to developments at the
Kl Paso conference between General
Scott and Ge.icral Obregon.
The Columbus telegraph office opened
suddenly during the night for transmis

to General Pershing.

Before the boat put off, several by

The boat overturned. The men strug
gled for some minutes in the icy w iter
for a Hold on the overturned boat.
Scores of i'ishemen watched helpless

three boats on the lake. Several at
tempted to reach the spot where the
men were struggling, by straddling logs
ami pailclling witn lioiinls.
A rowboat was t'innlly secured from

SALEM DISTRICT
PRUNE POOLTQ BE
T
About 1500 Acres Represent
ed, Making It Largest Ever
Formed In County
CALIFORNIA YIELD IS
PLACED AT 65 PER CENT
Prices Above Average Out
look For All Oregon Fruits
Is Unusually Good
The Salem district prune pool will be
closed tonight with about 1,500 acres
signed up by nearly 200 growers, ac
cording to the announcement of Man
ager Robert C. Paulus, of the Salem
Fruit union. There were 1,200 acres in
the pool Saturday night nnd numerous
growers were phoning to the fruit union
officers today to give their acreage
and ask that they be signed up with the
other growers in the pool. The prune
pool is tho largest pool handled by the
Salem Fruit union and this year will
have signed up nbout 1,500 acres out of
the 2,500 in the Salem district which
comprises Marion and parts of Tolk
counties.
As to the outlook for yield little can
be said at this time as in most of the
fruit sections of the district the trees
are only now shedding their blossoms
and it will be a. week or 10 days before
any accurate estimate of the yield can
be made. The pear crop will be short
according to the best information in the
hands of the fruit growers and the cher
ry crop is uncertain. There Is n large
acreage of cherries in benring this year
and the fruit has set on well but many
uncertain conditions of the weather
have tu be met by the growers.
The prune acreage in the Salem dis
trict has increased from 10 to 1.1 per
cent over last year but this will not
decrease the price according to the Cali
fornia reports, as the southern state ex
pects bwut nbout 05 per cent of last
year's yield. The outlook for prunes,
both in quality nnd price is the best for
years in Oregon according to Manager
rniilus and outside of the apple pros
pects the Oregon fruit growers appear
to be facing a prosperous year.
The following report of conditions in
California whiclftiave a large influence
upon Oregon fr.uit prices has been re
ceived from the Prune and Apricot
Growers' Information Bureau of Cali
fornia and the reports relating to
prunes arc given in full:
Reports from practically all sections
of the state indicate a very light crop.
It is still early to make an accurato
estimate, but we are led to believe that
the IStlfl prune crop will not be in excess
of 05 per cent of last year's crop esti
muted at 170,000,000 ninds, nnd that it
will probably run considerably less than
that. Indeed, the statement is freely
made in some quarters, that the. com
ing crop will be the lightest since 1910
when 75,000.000 pounds were produced.
In 19111, 90,000,000 pounds were pro
duced, no according to these authorities
the 1910 output will be between 75 nnd
90.000,000 pounds. One Snn Jose pack
er has estimated the IPlfi crop In the
Santa Clara valley at S., 000,000 pounds.
On the other hand another packer places
the output of this district at 05,000,000

CIRCULATION FIGURES THAT ARE EXACT;

Following is the correct
Capital Journal of Salem,
Total Average daily circulation for the 25 days of publication

CHAS. H. FISHER,
Publisher.
Subscribed and sworn to before me this 1st day of May, 1916.
op.,x . . DORA C. ANDRESEN,
oedi; Notary Public for Oregon.
This circulation statement is printed because the publishers of the Capital
t Journal believe that businessmen have a right to know
wnen mey ouy advertising space in a newspaper, we mane no circulation claims
simply a statement of circulation facts, which any advertiser is at liberty to in
vestigate for himself. Our mailing lists, carrier lists and press run figures are
at his service. We have no circulation secrets because we have no cause to be
ashamed of our subscription list, and no good reason for misrepresenting it in
any respect.
The Capital Journal believes that it has by far the largest circulation of any
newspaper attempting to cover this field and it is a legitimate subscription not
padded by fake voting contests or wholesale distribution of premiums. Further
more, 95 per cent of this circulation is in Marion and Polk counties, directly tribu
tary to the City of Salem;
-- fr44
pounds. In any event the outside dis
tricts are probably considerably lighter
than the Santa Clara district. The esti
mated crop percentages from the va
rious producing districts are as follows:
Chico, 2.1 per cent; Colusa, 50 per cent;
Napa, 40 per cent; Sonoma, 30 per cent;
Solano, 50 per cent; Yolo, 50 per cent;
Santa Clara, 50 per cent; Tulare, 90 per
cent; Sau Benito, 50 per cent.
Market: Since our last letter the
prices for both spot and future goods
have risen materially. As much as 5 1-2
cents has been offered for spot goods in
Santa Clara county. During the past six
weeks there has been a good movement
in the old crop at prices ranging from
.1 3 4 to 5 1-2 cents. The bulk of the
1915 prunes are now in the hands of the
holders who expect to realize a C cent
basis or better. The increase in the spot I
prune price is mainly due, according to
tho New York Journal of. Commerce,
"to a marked increase in the consum
ing demand."
The market for the 1916 crop is in
very good shape from the growers'
viewpoint. There is a large short inter
est still uncovered, as much ns, perhaps,
20,000,000 pounds or 20 per cent of the
entire crop. Sales to dnte, in California
by growers to packers, have not been in
excess of 2,000 tons, and most of these
sales have been on a 5 cent bailis or
better As much as 6 cents has been of
fered in at least one instance although
this was a special case. The Bureau
believes that there is no reason why
any grower should sell his 1910 crop
for less than 5 1-2 cents.
