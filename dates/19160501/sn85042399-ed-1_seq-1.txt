Tuesday the Talent Farmers' Club
hed an Important meeting at the
town hall. Some time ago a meeting
was held for the purpose of recom
mending directors for the Irrigation
proposition, and the men recommend
ed for this job are 0. A. Manning of
Talent, R. E. Roblson of Talent and
J. W. Mlllner of Ashland. At that
time the treasurer of the district was
overlooked, so at the Tuesday's meet
ing Mr. Emmett Beeson was recom
mended. The question of whether an
irrigation district will be formed will
be decided at the primary election on
May 19, and if at the election the
majority of votes are for the irriga
tion district, the above mentioned
directors will have full charge and
will proceed with the consideration
of the Irrigation projects.
At the same meeting J. J. Cham
bers, who owned Duck Lake water

him, Is receiving serious considera

Cambers has been asked to submit
detailed data concerning the project.
Through misinformation the state

main stream which feeds Buck lake
is thirty yards wide and twelve feet
deep. This should have read thirty
feet wide and four feet deep, accord

Churchill Outlines
Rural School Plan
Superlntendent Churchill, head of
the Oregon school system, outlined a
campaign which, has been instituted
to raise the standard of the rural
schools of Oreeon. before the South -
ern Oregon District Federation of
Women's Clubs last Wednesday. Mr.
ChurcbiH first told of the deplorable
condltions which had existed in, the"
rural scnoois 01 uregon prior 10 me
awakening of Interest in this impor
tant devision of the state's education
al system three years ago.
He stated that for twenty-five years
absolutely no record was kept of the
rural schools and no standard
manded. The rural schools com-
manded no attention outside of their
little circles and were not recognized
as a part of the state's system. Now,
however, the rural schools have be
come recognized as a vita! part of the
educational system everywhere and
nil the states have made some kind
of systematic effort to raise the stand
ard.
At the last session of the legisla
ture Miss Towne of Jackson county
Introduced a bill which required a
minimum term of eight months In
every school In Oregon and required
that teachers have at least one year of
elementary training In teaching.
The school authorities have now
outlined a plan which they designate
as the county unit plan, and Superin
tendent Churchill is working in the
interests of this plan. The plan is
to divide every county into five dis
tricts. At an annual meeting each
district is to elect one member to a
board which will have the handling
of school funds and elect the superin
tendent of the district. The board
will place the teachers and buy and
install equipment. The county will
then be the unit of taxation for the
rural school systems.
This plan has the backing of the
United States board of education and
is considered the ideal way of hand
ling the problems of the rural schools.
A part of the campaign for a higher
standard of rural schools includes
more normal schools in the Btate. Mr.
Churclhil's statements regarding the
re-establishment of the Southern Ore
gon Normal were applauded enthusi
astically. He stated that the time Is
coming when there will be no state
teachers' examinations, but the teach
ers will be required to keep up to the
minute by reading circle work.

Here's Where Greer
Got the Money
' It is unfortunate that Ashland of
ficials are compelled to resort to
affidavits to defend their reputation
against false and malicious charges.
The following affidavit and re
ceipt show where Greer got the
money to pay off the $4,000 mort
gage which enemies recently in-
1 slnuated likely came out of the
, Smith-Emery contract on the springs
enterprise, and that the Tidings was
;P"t out of Greer's name to avoid de-
. ticiency judgments,
, X umber One Nailed.
Just to bring out the truth, the
following items are copied from the
! vouchers which the Springs Water
; Commission issued for printing let-
de-'ter heads, and include every letter!
head printed by the Tidings for. the
Springs Water Commission:
June 14, 1915, 1,500 letter
heads for publicity depart
ment 7.00
Sept. 25, 1915, 2,000 letter
. heads (one color).. 8.00
Nov. 23, 1915, printing glass
of water on 500 letter heads 1.25
Jan. 13, 1916, printing 1,000
letter heads 6-00
Jan. 26, 1916, printing 1,500
letter heals, two colors. ... 10.00
March 10, 1916, printing 1,000
letter heads, two colors... 7.50
It will be seen that in not a single
Instance did the Tidings charge $10
for 1,000 letterheads. The only item
that nearly approximates that is the
item of January 26, in which 1,500
letter heads not 1,000 were print
ed for $10. These were printed on
twenty-four-ponnd Exchange bond,
in two colors. This the Tidings sup
plied and charged the same price it
gets from other customers for the
same service, $10 for 1,500 of them.
Blow Up Produce
Association Safe
Some time ean sunuay mornuiK, i
burglars, who must have been ex- J
perts, from the thorough and work- j
manlike job which they pertormeu,
blew up the safe In the Ashland Fruit
and Produce Association's office, so-
curing about $20. Entrance was se
cured through a window by breaking
the glass. The door was blown off
the safe, the explosion breaking sev
eral windows and scattering frag
ments all over the office. Probably
because of the proximity to the rail
road yards, the explosion was not
heard by anyone In the neighborhood.
No traces of the burgHars were left
except two heel marks In front of the
safe. Not a single finger print oonld
be fpund.or other clue of any wstew j

The First Southern Oregon District
Federation of Women's Clubs held its
third "annual convention In Auxiliary
hall at Ashland April 26, 27 and 2$,
1916.
Jfiss Marian B. Towne of Phoenix
presided in her happiest vein through
out the entire session. She furnished
an unusually instructive and classy
program.
Following the refilstratlon of dole-
gates, the entire audience made
"America" ring, giving promise of
the enthusiasm and intense Interest
that would prevail.
Then we came right down to solid
thinking in State Superintendent
Churchill's address on "The Influence
of School Legislation." He spoke
earnestly on what can bo done to Im
prove rural schools, but does not ad
vocate the "teachorago" of which the
Washington state superintendent Is
so optimistic. By this plan rural
teachers have a cottage in each dis
trict which becomes a real home to
them during tliolr Incumbency. There
are twenty-eight such school-cottages
In Oregon, but In Mr. Churchill's
opinion they are a failure. Then he
gave us some measures necessary to
carry out the program of Improve
ment through legislative enactment.
He explained at length the county
unit system and the connty unit of
taxation. The schools of our state
