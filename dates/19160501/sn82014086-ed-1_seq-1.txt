METHODISTS IN SYMPATHY , -'
WITH PRESIDENT WILSON
In Hia Efforts to Keep United States
Free from European War.
Saratoga Springs, 'N. T., April 30.
Assurances that Methodists of the
United iStates were in sympathy with
President Wilson's efforts to keep the
United States from becoming involved
in the European war was voiced here
today by Bishop Earl Cranston of
Washington, D. C. Bishop Cranston,
who will open the 27th general confer
ence of the Methodist Episcopal church
here tomorrow, was addressing a pre
liminary conference. -
"I would assure the president or the
United States," Bishop Cranston eaid.
that whatever temporary bacKsuding
may happen - when a few Methodists
here or wonder may fall under the
spell of a magnetic political leader.
the great body of our people are in full
sympathy with all of his patriotic and
Christian endeacors to keep this nation
out of the European embroilment.
Tve Methodists do not believe that
it is patriotic for a few Americans tov
insist upon their technical right to
travel. at sea in such a time as this,
for personal reasons, at the risk of
bringing the "horrors and desolations
of war upon millions of their fellow
Americans.".-
During his address Bishop Cranston
endorsed the plan proposed for the un
ion of the northern and southern
branches of the church which is to be
considered by the general conference.

El Paso. Texas, , April 0. Mexican
and American officials conferlng over
the disposition of the American forces
in Mexico marked time today, while
Generals Hugh I Scott and Frederick
Funston awaited word from Washing
ton as to the next step to be taken in
the negotiations , with General Obre
gon. . . - . yr '' -
The report of the "American repre
sentatives on the first conference went
forward, by wire early this morning.
On the answer of - President Wilson
and Secretaries Lansing and Baker to
its recommendations depends the fu
ture status of the conference.
:. Facta Developed. r .
In the meantime the following facta
developed : - v.
That to. date the apparent intention
of the Washington government to kap
General PershingJs column in Mexico
has not been changed. -. - .
. That General Qbregon in yesterday' e
conference served no sort of notice on
Generals Scott and Funston that could
be construed as an ultimatum . de
manding immediate withdrawal. -,
That the desire of the de facto gov
ernment for withdrawal was - again
stated but that the only discussion
along this line was regarding the ad
visability of an American retirement.
Cooperation Considered.
' That there was Considerable discus
sion of the possibility of effective
American and Mexican cooperation.
That ther'v was considerable dis
cussion of the possibility of effective
American and Mexican cooperation in
the eradication of scattered . Villa
bandit groups. .,
That there is a strong possibility
only one more conference will be held,
that depending on the wishes of the
Washington government.
Supplies Going Forward to Troopev

are proceeding, shipments of . supplies
to the American expedition's front are
going forward uninterruptedly, among
other supplies leaving the Columbus
base1 today being nine truckloads of

. Withdrawal of Troop Chief Topic
Front stray bits of information that
became known today it appears that
yesterday's "conference- ended with- the
rmestion of withdrawal of the Pnited
States troops still uppermost in tha
minds of the Mexican conferees. They
are understood to have tried to kn
press on the. American representatives
that political conditions in Mexico are
such that they cannot be responsible
for any . eventualities that may result
from continued occupation of Mexican
jsoil by he United States. -vThey are
"said also to have street upon the fact
that the position of the Carranza government-would
be extremely difficult
if the expeditionary movement werg
not ended.
' Attempt to Reach an Agreement
In view of the already expressed at
titude of the Americans that they
were unable to discuss any question
other than that of cooperation of the
two armies in dispersing the various
bandit organizations, the next step
was to attempt to reach a. basis on
which both sides might meet.
Washington's answer to the tele
gram despatched by Generals Scott
and Funston this morning is expected
to -divluge whether such a basis can
be established.

Labor's Right to Share In Prosperity
New York, April 30. The- right . of
labor to an increased share in the
country's prosperity resulting from the
war, joined with the higher cost of
living, are declared by labor leaders
generally to form from the foundation
of labor demands. . , -

Operator and Miners Reach Agree-
'. ,v." ment. ,
; 'Ah encouraflng development - almost
on the eve of May Day waa the an
nouncement that a tentative .agree
ment had been reached ooy the' repre
sentatives of the operators "and miners
which probably would avert a strike of
175,000 miners in the anthracite coal
fields. . : -" - ..- .- ' - - . -
: -Announcement was made tonight,
also, .-that because of . concessions
granted by steamship companies and
master stevedores, a general strike of
workmen on the water front, in this
city was not probable. ' '-'-.--Garment
Workers May Strike."
Industrial disturbances here in
clude one of the mos serious in the
city's history. The Cloak, Suit and
Skirt Manufacturers' Association,
members of which do an aggregate
annual business estimated at $376,000,-000,-
anticipating a possible strike
during the height of the summer's ac
tivities in garment making, forestalled
such action last week by declaring a
lockout affecting between . 80,000 and
35,0000 employes. Union leaders ex
pressed belief today that the trouble
will last until September 1. The lock
out was followed by a threat on the
part of some 85,000 employes in inde
pendent shops to : walk out tomorrow
or Tuesday unless the employers grant
their demand for- a continuance of the
1910 protocol favoring union workers
over those unorganized. .

workers and.- 1,600 customs tailors.
There iso are scores of other strikes
in the Metropolitain in the metropoli
tan district and in New Jersey in
volving small numbers but aggregat
ing thousands of ehmployes. The de
mands are highed wages and short

A. F of L. Organizer's Views.
Hugh Prayne, general organizer here
for the American Federation of Labor
said today that, all tolds more men and
more women were enjoying higher pay
and shorter hours han ever before in
this city.,'- ..!" :- . . - , .
Labor Not Getting Too Much. ' ,
''Talk of reaction setting in," Mr.
Frayne added, : "does . hot . alarm me.
Labor is not getting too much. What
some have termed excessive demands
on the part of the wage earners are not
excessive. Labor is adjusting - itself
to conditions as they exist and wage
scales now asked are only what labor is
entitled, to had the employers kept up
wages with the gradual advance in the
cost of living', within the past few
years. Employers cite demands of
labor, but they -must remember that
there also are. demands upon ; labor
that labor must meet to live."
" Threatened Strikes Settled. -
r During the past two weeks, . accord
ing to Colonel M. J. Reagan, a member
of the state hoard of mediation of the
department of labor, threatened strikes
in various industries in the metropolis
district have been settled, - averting
idleness for more than 20,000 persons.
In a maorijty of the cases" settlement
has been through mediation In which
the employes have benefited by ad
vanced wages and shorter hours. -Wage
Increases Average 10 to 14 Per
Cent. . '
" Summing up the labor situation for
the year, , Solonel reagan -, said that
aside from railroad emloyes there has
been -a general advance throughout
New York state that will average 10 to
14 per cent.. Many : railroad workers
in . unclassified departments .of certain
roads also have benefited..
