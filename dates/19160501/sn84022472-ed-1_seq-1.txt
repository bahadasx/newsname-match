WHISTLES TOOT AND
SPECTATORS CHEER
Col. Roosevelt's Brother-in-
Law Among Guests at
Lake Co. Shipyards.
Amid the tooting of whistles from
many sea craft and factories, and a
chorus of cheers from thousands of
spectators, the L-5, tl-e first of eight
submarine boats which the Lake Tor
pedo Boat Co. is building for the
United States government was launch
ed today, at the yards of the company
at the foot of Seaview avenue. The
launching went off without a hitch ex
cept for the fact that it took place 16
minutes ahead of ' the . schedule time.
It had been planned for 10:30 but the
tide -rose earlyyand Commander Rich
ard H. M. Rdbinson, general manager
of the company,, rather than take a
chance later gave the word to send
the boat into the water. . -
The- boat was sent, stern first, into
tb,e channel on the south side- between
the Lake yards and Steeplechase Is
land. A stand about 25 feet high and
built to accommodate about a hun
f T persons had been erected; at the
bow of the boat which was well in
shore. The boat restedLon the usual
cradle, fixed to the underways which
were covered thickly with grease. The
fore-end of this cradle is known as
the "mose." All that was necessary to
effect the launching was the sawing of
the extended - fore-ends of the bottom
timber of t&is -cradle known techni
cally as . the. "nose." This huge tim
ber, bolted to the underways, held the
boat In place.
As the workmen, at a signal from
Commander Robinson, began sawing
tnis timoer ms little -daughter, Rosa
lind Robinson,- appeared -at the center
of the stand.' Long thin' streamers of
silk bunting-'extended! d-ewn the bow
of the boat and were joined to a net
work of'silk bunting yarn- in which
was encased a bottle " of - champagne.
Miss Robinson held this bottle up even
with her shoulder and as the; big tim
ber was sawed through and ; the boat
began slowly to slip along the ways
he flung the bottle against the bow.

More than 3,000 invitations had been
issued hy 'the Lake Torpedo Boat Co.
and it is estimated that ' fully that
number were swarming in the Lake
yards when the L-5 went off the ways.
Hundreds of others were perched on
the bridge to Steeplechase Island, on
the shores of the creeks in the vicin
ity, on the roofs of near-by houses arid
on other vantafee points.
As the hew submarine slid grace.-!

Charles H. Mansfield, of New Haven,
Conn., engineer of the Gilt Edge Ex
press, which was in collision with a
local train on the New York, New Ha
ven & Hartford Railroad, at Bradford,
April 17, causing the death of five pas
sengers, pleaded not guilty today to
two indictments charging manslaugh
ter. .The indictments, which were return
ed by a special grand jury last Thurs
day, alleged that Mansfield was re
sponsible for the deaths of Miss Janet
Clarke, of Westerly, and Mrs. Olivia
Martell, of Southbridge, Mass.
Judge Charles F. Stearns, of the
superior court, who -presided at .to
day's hearing, allowed Mansfield ten

if he desired. He . was released on
5,000 bonds. The state's ' attorenys
urged a speedy -trial and suggested
that it open next Monday.
Justice Stearns, however, said that
because of the serious nature of the
case the defendant should be allowed
time to prepare his defense,. The case
probably will not be tried until Sep
tember.
In his ' testimony before interstate
commerce commission mvestagtors,
Engineer Mansfield asserted that the

Challenges Bowers' Mo

Ridiculous Sales on Books
Herbert M. Knapp, head of the
former banking firm of Burr & Knapp,
was called upon the witness stand be
fore Referee in Bankruptcy John W.
Banks today to be examined by Spots
wood D. Bowers, counsel for several
creditors, as to' his acts for the de
funct company and many entries that
appear on the books.
Among the facts disclosed at this
morning's session, a continuance of
which is on this afternoon are these:
Mrs. H. M. Knapp drew $1,800,
for, her household expenses in ad- -,
dition to her regular division of
, profits from the business and
moneys paid to her by her hus
band. Knapp, though many times
''worried about the finances of the
company, believed up to the day
of the receivership, that some
thing would come up which
would permit the concern to go
on." . A couij awjii of $187,000
to the Watervliet Hydraulic Co.
came too late to prevent catastro
phe. That the Kairview Lawn prop
erty, recently sold for less than
$,000 was, as previously testified
by, Hervie Burr, worth between
' $50,000 and $0,000 and that
pttrer : securities of the company
mates have since been sold for V
large, sums of money.
. The Burr & Knapp Co. was ac- .
, customed to , "kite" checks upon
the Georgia Loan Trust Co-,
through the First-Bridgeport Na
tional Bank and that shortly be-;
fors the failure the practice was
- called "irregular" and Burr &
Knapp were- called "upon to de-,
posit $125,000 worth of securities
with the local bank. The special
account with the Georgia Loan &
Trust Co. under which these
check operations were held,, was '
disclosed to show totals of $392.
000 worth of such transactions
during May-and June, 1914.
An effort to disclose -whether these
check transactions' had had the coun
tenance of the directors of the Geor
gia Loan & Trust Co. or had been
done by, Knapp personally was abor
tive and Knapp declared that he is
not now a director of the company
and if he were he would not disclose
a list of the stockholders to the. inves
tigators. -
Although $130,000 in drafts were re
turned to Bridgeport in 1914 with
checks aggregating $109,500 the inves
tigation showed thai) no records were
kept of the securities turned over to
the Bridgeport bank.
An attempt to show that a divided
not was kept at one of the local banks
for the express purpose of covering
uvcrumiLS was uui iivzli xy auuuuuwu
f op in the investigation today.
Efforts to show that Mrs. Mary H.
Burr was aware of transactions being
made by the Burr & Knapp firm
brought forth the assertion from the
witness that if any criminal transac
tions should ' be uncovered In the in
vestigation he was alone responsibly
and would accept the blame. It was
disclosed, however, that in the sum
mer, of 1913 the concern was much
worried by financial conditions and
that Mrs. Burr saved the day by hav

But City Through Park
Board May Institute Con
demnation Proceedings.
Notable among the recommenda
tions which will be included in the
forthcoming report of the vice com
mission is one that calls forthe cre
ation of a permanent commission on
recreation, and for the acquisition for
that commission, of the 70 acres of
land once known as Pleasure" Beach,
but more lately as Steeplechase or
Sea Breeze Island.
The vice commission's recommenda
tion of the establishment of an amuse
ment or recreation commission is
based upon reports of investigators
which are interpreted to indicate the
need of a properly regulated place of
amusement suitable for family recrea
tion. '
"While the details are as yet only
under discussion, the general scope of
the plan is to inaugurate an amuse
ment ' pare, with the city in charge,
with its concessions for sale to lessees,
who are to operate them under the
supervision of the municipal commis
sion. ' ' s
The purchase of the island would be
effected, under the ,plan of the vice
commission, through the park depart
ment, which has the authority, in
event of unsatisfactory negotiations
with land owners, to take property for
park purposes under condemnation
proceedings, the- court fixing a valua
tion on the property.
The park board has at its disposal
now", for park improvements, as the
result of the approval at the recent
snecial election. $265,000 in bonds, to
be sold, probably at a slight premium.
The"plan of the park board is to use
the 'bulk of this cash In the Fayer
weather Island project the extension
of the boulevard at Seaside Park from
the present end, to the -lighthouse on
Fayerweather Island, and to build a
bridge from this extended boulevard
across Black Rock harbor into-Brewy
ster street.
The money to he realized' -from the
park bonds, Judging from tha cost of
the .boulevard extension thus far Com
pleted, may be too little for the com
pletion of all this work, and unless the
park board is willing to co-operate in
the project, it may be defeated for
lack of cash. .
The property is owned by the ' heirs
of the late John II. McMahan. It is
reported that the owner's price is 1 in
the neighborhood of $400,000.
