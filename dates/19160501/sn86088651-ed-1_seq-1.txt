MR. KELLOGQ TO 8PEAK.
Measures to Prevent War 8ubject at
College Y. M. C. A.
College, May 1.
Editor Bryan Daily Eagle:
Next Thursday evening at 7:40, In
the Y. M. C. A. auditorium. I am
planning to give a talk on "Proposed
Measures for Preventing War,' and I
should appreciate your giving notice
of the meeting, and perhaps In addi
tion putting In s reminder in your
Thursday Issue. All Interested will
be welcome, and I hope that discus
sion from the floor will follow.
Much bas been said In public or
late on the question of preparedness
but this Is only a small part of a big
ger problem. It la my Arm belief that
the nations are not fighting because
they want to, but because they are
victims of a pernicious system. Soon
er or later that system will hare to
give way to a better one, and the
first step toward progress Is for the
people of this country to gire the
problem their best thoughts.
Very truly yours,
E. W. KELLOGG.

Dublin, May 1. Rumors of stern
action by the troops against the post-
office, the Sinn Felners stronghold,
spread around the city yesterday
morning. It Would have been pos
sible to bombard the place at any
time, but It waa considered undesir
able to destroy a budding which had
lust been renovated by the govern
ment. Buildings In Sackrille Street
all around the postofflce hare been
burned down. Although It Is Impos
sible tq obtain an estimate of the dam
age it can be' placed conservatively at
somethlng"tBore than $10,000,000.
Correspondents who are assembled
in the Northwall quarter were an
ablo tooommonliito V tn'omtnt
with headquarters. Officers return
ing from the fighting area reported
everything much quieter than for sev
eral days, and confirmed the belief
that the military haa the situation
well tn hand.
From the roof of the correspond
ents' hotel msny fires could be ob
served, mostly In central Dublin. The
hotel is kept under a constant fire
by well concealed snipers from both
the north snd the south.
The soldiers reply whenever they
see the flash of a rifle, but the lo
cations of the snipers had not been
discovered np to noon.
AH the houses around Northwall
were cleared of men Aaturday nlsht
by troops, who rounded tbem up and
kept them la custody until daybreak.
Firing went on, however, as briskly
as err.
