MEETING TONIGHT
Organization of a League Is
Among the Possibil
ities.
A mass meeting of all the baseball
players and those whose ambitioij is to
become a baseball player will be held
tonight at the Y. M. C. A. at 7:30. The
meeting is called by Physical Director
Blickley and it is likely that the dis
cussion of the baseball plans will re
sult in the formation^ of a league of
some sort that will give most every
one an opportunity to engage In the
national pastime.
Baseball players and all who arc in
terested in the game whether mem
bers of the Y. M. C. A. or not are
urged to be present so that a definite
course of action can be determined
upon. Director Blickley has personal
ly visited a large number of the mem
bers of last year's teams that were
members of the local leagues and re
quested them to be present but owing
to the short notice of the meeting it
has been Impossible for him to see
overyone. For thsi reason it is urged
that all players be present whether
notified or not. With the .tpprojy a*ng
straw hat season the baseball fans of
the city are restless and consumed
with an uncontrollable desire to sit in
jtlio bleachers and criticise the urapiro
and give free and pertinent advice to'
each and every player.
To provide a gratification of this I
laudable and natural ttesire is the am-1
bition of the management of the Y. M. I
C. A. and the mass meeting tonight
is the first step in the accomplishment
of this purpose.
Registrars Sit at
Advertised Places
Two registrars in each of the 47 vot
ing precincts in Marion county are
sitting today to receive additional
name sof voters that were not regis
tered in the canvass of their precincts.
These men began their duties this
morning as required by the election
law and beginning at nine o'clock a.
m. sit in a place advertised in each
precinct until nine o'clock p. m. The
law requires that these men sit two
days, so tomorrow the same hours
will bo observed.
The completed registration books
are required to be returned to the
county court ou the second Monday
in May bo it is essential that every
voter is sure that his name is on the
books before their completion tomor
row. The registrars are at their ad
vertised places all day except an hour
off at noon and evening for their
meals.
It is expected that tbo total regis
tration this year will be considerably
more than that at the last previous
general election. The total vote cast
in Marion county for the five presiden
tial candidates in 1912 was 9,743. This
number may be increased by nearly
one thousand at the coming Novem
ber election.

CITY BUILDING
Dentists of City Ask Permis
sion to Open One
There.
FIGHT THE NEW TUXES
Theatres Succeed in Getting
Their Fee Restored to
the Old Figure.
At the meeting of the City Board of |
Affairs this morning in the board ,
'meeting room. Dr. H. L. Satterlield
appeared and speaking in behall of
the dentists of the city informed the i
Board that the Associated Charities,
Women's club and the Board of Edu- \
cation of the Fairmopt independent!
district have held conferences with
. ralrmont dentists and decidcd to
place a free dental clinic in the muni* j
cipal building
The arrangements have not beeni
completed but it is the desire of thej
dentists to open a room in the city
building and give free treatment to j
those who are In need of such treat-1
inent and who will be recommended;
by the Associated Charities as beta*
worthy.
The clinic will be open daily except J
Sunday and on each day a different I
dentists will give his time to hand
ling the charity canes. This is an
innovation in Fairmont and will be!
backed and helped along by all per
sons who are In position to do so.
The Board asked Dr. Satterfield to re
turn at a later date with a doflnito
outline of the entire plan and to re
submit it to the Board.
The Board unanimously approved
the plan as far as the details were
furnished and it is thought that the
room on the third floor of the city
building in which the city engineer
was formerly located will be used for
the clinic work.
Rollo J. Conley appeared before the
Board with a letter from the Fairmout
West Virginia Humane society askiug
the city for permission to take care
of all dogs unlicensed in the city. The
society will handle all cases for a
fee. The Board will investigate and
answer the communication as soon a?
the matter is decidcd.
The proposed license ordinance is
coming in for it's share of trouble on
the part of the members of the Board.
M. Earl Morgan appeared in behalf
of all the theatres of the city except
the Colonial. French McCray* appear
ed for tlie Colonial. They asked that
the proposed fee of $100 a year for
theatres be cancelled and the pres
ent fee of $40 a year remain on the
books. Earl Morgau In a masterful
speech before tho board stated tnaii
the citv could not raise the license
to $100 according to law and thai,
further if such fee ($100) were .charg
ed and legally permissable. the the
atres of Fairmont could not stand it.
He explained that there are at prt's- l
ent more show houses in Fairmont'
than the theatre-going public can sup
port and that it has boon an up hill,
tight for all of them.
The state license is $40. Mr. Morgan
explained that the law says that a city 1
of less than 10,000 populatloa can
charge $40 a year but that thosj ov
er 10,000 are permitted to charge $100.
He Intimated that the last official cen
sus which was taken in 11)10 t?how<id
Fairmont with less than 10,0uC popu
lation and therefore came un-lor ?1i.it
law. Tho fact that Fairmont's police
i census in 1913 showed 15,'jI'S and that
the present estimated population is
conseratively said to be 17,^00 would
not enter into the matter, according
to Mr. Morgan. Rather than incon
I venience the theatres ov to take
chances in getting mixed up in a legal
fight the Board voted to allow the 1
1 cense to remain at $40 a yoar.
| Other business men of the city have
I talked to members of the Board and
I psked that the matter of raising li
censes be looked into thoroughly be
fore any action is taken as there ere
I pool rooms, etc., which will be unable
I to pay the fee. Further consideration.
1 of the ordinance waB taks.i up this
| afternoon and the whole ordinance
! will be recast. Charl S. lluqs, let
resenting the citizens of Hill Crest
appeared before the Board and asked
that the city light Hill Cost avenue
The matter was referred to Light and
Street Commissioner Albert Lehman
and relief was promised to the citi
zens. Commissioner Lehmjui asked
tho Board fuJ permissioi to rebuild
the board walk leading to the wharf,
j He stated that on account of the great
amount of traffic on that walk during
the summer that he consiiorel it a
needed improvement. He was grant
ed permission to do the work.
The liquor ordinance was held over
! for second reading. Tnis will take
place at the meeting next Moaday
I morning.

WASHINGTON', D. C., May 1.?
That (Jcorge N. Bowers, of Martins
burg, will bo elected to congress from
, Ilie second district at the special dec
I Hon 10 lie liclil Tuesday of next week,'
is a belief that has become strong
'With Uepubllcan'national and slate
leaders here. It Is based on late and
| very encouraging reports from each I
| county in Ihe district.
These reports are to the effect that
the votere of the district are urouseu
to tlie national significance of the out-1
come of this brier, though spirited
campaign, and tliut those of Kepubl
can affiliations, at least, aro willing to
rise above petty personal matters to
I lV.?i i fa(^ p,ain of Parl>' Patriotism,
and help to win a victory for the party
which will be heralded,in the morning
press of the country May 10 as a blow
augury of llepublican victory in tne
augury of Keublican victory in the
nation next November.
That the Democratic national ad
ministration is playing every card in
Us hand lo hold the Second district
for the o(Toct a victory for its party
would have nationally is patent from
the number and size of the oratorical
suns they have sent to the front.
Speaker Clark, Solicitor General Da
vis, and Secretary of Labor Wilson are
some of the big spellbinders who have
been sent Into the district. The Ite
publican National Congressional Com
lnUtec has sent in the biggest and bost
It has at its disposal at this time. It

here seems to be bringing the right

w,;V1,!"tCr!?IUe ?ct counectlbu
with the contest, they say, is the reort
of large defections from thc Demo
cratic ranks, due partly to disapproval
on thc part of many independent-think
nig.voters o the national administra
tion and partly due to discontent with
the personality of candidate Woods.
fllr. Woods is not regarded by his
party's leaders as personally a very
strong and popular candidate, and
hence the necessity of tagging him on
to President Wilson with the slogen
Jiuoted above In the hope that it might
help some, or might, leastways, put
a stopcock on any growing d'isaltec
lion on his own account.
Although not a public speaker as ev
erybody knows, but a successful busi
ness man o life-long training. George
uowors Is considerable of a "mixer"
a man s man as it were, and has pros
ecutod ar. aggressive personnl cam
paign with diligence and ability from
the day of his nomination. He has
covered the district very closely in tho
brief time he had at his disposal. lie
has had the help of many strong lead
ers In the district, and the reports
now aro that tho Republicans are go
ing to get to tho polls and are going
to voto the district back Into the lie
publican column May 9. To counteract
his personal popularity, and his abil
ity to meet the voters individually the
opposition has made some vicious'and
unfounded personal attacks upon Mr
Bowers Which, the Republican leaders
declares are "worked over stud" from
two years ago, which was used against
him. They say it has had no effect on
the voters, who understand and the
underlying motives and the partisan
animus. On the contrary they assert
that Buch unfounded assaults have on
ly tended to arouse the Republican vo
ters of the district to an understanding
of the deperation of the Wilson odmln
istration in Its effort to save itself from
a stinging rebuke In the Second dis
trict, which will prove a deadening
blow to it and to the "morale" of the
Democratic party nationally.
There Is no getting around it. the
fight In the Second district is no local
political side show. It Is the reaf
the big?thing. It Is a battle royal be
tween the two great national parties
or a victory which will he heralded
throughout the land as national in Its
importance and significance.

have agreed to close at 5:30,'o'clock.
It is understood that the jewelers al
!sa will make arrangements to close
Ithoir establishments-at 5 o'clock,
j While a half hour's difference
doesn'to souud like much, it makes a
vast difference to the employes of the
store, particularly as the warm days
come. The local merchants believe
that they get better service through

[that was used in Mannington district

ground. They are painted red and are
easily seen and readable from a con

so be placed at all the cross roads
and intersecting pikes in the county.
When this work is completed it will
be practically impossible for any one!
who can read to become lost in this
county. Work of this kind in co-oper

MEET IS ON TODAY
Some Real Surprises Pre
dicted Among the Day's
Results.
1 Lovers of field sports will have their
first opportunity today to see track
contestanst on local grounds. The In
ter class High school meet will be held
at South Side Park at 2:30 and some
real surprises in some of the events
is certain to be the result. The show
ing that many of the men have made
[during the past two weeks of unfav
j orablc weather has truly bene remark
'able.
[ The chief phenomenon that has de
veloped so far is the half mile runner
Geo. Hill. This boy <Jld'a half Satur
day in the fast time of two minuteB
(and fifteen seconds, at no time in the
distance was he extended and finished
cool and strong. 'Coaches Jones and
|Verner are of the opinion that he can
I easily beat two minutes any time they
i wish to turn him loose. Hill is also
ja member of the relay team and may
double in the quarter mile ovent.
I The meeting this afternoon will
practically deaide the membership of
