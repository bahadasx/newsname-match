afternoon by the Judge.
The trial was held between 3 and I
Saturday afternoon and wa attended
by a large number of people. Mayor
J. A. Rest and Officer Frank Nash
were the two prosecuting witnesses.
Nash testified first that he cautioned
Gibson to change his method of danc
ing when he noticed him dancing close
to his partner and In u way he con
sidered improper. The mayor declar
ed the defendant was dancing a
"cross between a rag and a walk
dnnee" but what he objected to most
he said, was that he did not obey the
placard on the wall which read
"Eight steps and turn."
The ordinance prohibits ragging
and indecent dancing but the prose

The defendant, a half dozen ladies

the middle-aged married lady with
whom he was dancimt just before his
arrest, the two floor masters and
others at the dance, testified, some
very positively, that Gibson was not
ragging nor dancing In any manner
suggestive of Indecency. His wife,
too, was among the witnesses. Gibson
further stated that he never had rag

Tentative Draft Still Undergoing
Changes But Fundamental Points
Will Remain Unaltered.
GERARD'S REPORT IS ON WAY
American Ambassador said to Have
Dispatched Long; Message Regard

Washington Is Annoyed Over the
German Delay.
BERLIN, May 1. Ctermany's reply
to America's submarine demands will I
be dispatched to Washington this week '
unless the unexpected happens. The!
tentative draft is still undergoing j
changes. The decision regarding the
fundamental questions Is unaltered.
However, certain newspapers warned I
the public not to count for a certain! i
on America's full agreement with the
attitude of the reply.
WASHINGTON. May 1. A long
dispatch from Gerard, outlining the
conference with the kaiser, was re
ported en route today. It may reveal
what Germany proposes to do regard
ing meeting the American demands.
Unofficial Berlin reports of a reac-1
lion in the optimism there is being re
flected here In annoyance over the
delayed reply. It was deemed un
likely that Germany would trifle with
the American opinion by permitting
I the anniverslty of the Lusttanla dis
aster, Saturday, to pass without riefi
note avowals of the present case. It
was believed that the president will
not wait longer than Saturday for a
reply. Unless early evidence of a
note is forthcomng, Wilson is likely
to suggest to Gerard that the time is
up. Although the reply was complet
ed on Friday, a delay followed the
conference between Gerard and the
kaiser. Indicating that Gerard did not
consider the reply acceptable.
