PARIS, May 1.—-Following a violent
bombardment, the Germans last night
launched what the war office described
as a "powerful, close formation at
tack" against the trenchea recently,
gained by the French north of Dead
Man's hill.
The assaults broke down under
Freneh fire, the enemy suffering enor
mous losses. Another German attack
on the Cumleree sector was also re
pulsed.
The German attaok was delivered
with more violence than were the
blows last Friday that marked the re
sumption of the crown prince's drivs
on Verdun. Guns of all calibre first
assailed the French positions north
west of Verdun, cannonading not only
the Dead Man's hill but HCI 304 and
even extending the bombardment east
of the river to Vaux.
A curtain of French mitrailleuse
fire swept the advancing Germar.a
and mowed them dowr. by the hun
dreds. The stroke against Cumleree
waa beaten back In similar fashion.
French air squadrons have been
very active throughout the last thirty

BERLIN, (via wireless to Sayvllle)
May 1.—Four British generals and
510 English and Indian officers were
among the prisoners taken by the
Turks at Kut-EI-Amara, according to
Constantinople despatches today.
British losses In the Mesopotamlan
fighting In March and April were
eatl mated at 20,000,
The booty taken at Kut-EI-Amara
has not yet been counted, aald the
dispatch, "but among the prisoners/

and 270 Indian officers. .The Turklsi/
commander in chief, Halil Vasha, al
lowed General Townshend to keep his
sword."
When flags were displayed in Con
stantinople in celebration of the vic
tory at Kut-EI-Amara, It was observed
that several British commercial
houses flew the Turkish flag.
Genanal Townshend first offered to
surrender the town of Kut-EI-Amara
with all the British artillery and
more than $5,000,000 In cash, on con
dition that he be allowed to retire with
his forces with all military honors, a
Turkish new* agency reported. The
Turks declined this offer, whereupon
General Townehend made an uncon
ditional surrender.
German critics, commenting on the
British surrender at Kut-EJ-Amara,
recalled that today Is the first an
niversary of the date on which Lord
Kitchener waa quoted as saying that
he did not know when the war
would end, but that it would begin
May 1, 1915. In the year that has
elapsed it was pointed out here, the
central empires won their great
victory over the Russians, conquered
Serbia, Montenegro and nearly all
Albania and drove their lines In close
about Verdun. In the same period
the allies were forced to quit the
Dardanelles campaign and scored no
important success on the western
front, and tha British were defeated

The court in a recor-t decision said
it would suspend Issuance of a de

To prevent a defect such as has

EL PASO, Texas, May 1.—The
question of withdrawing the punitive
expedition from Mexico, on whidh
may depend peace or war between
the United States and Mexico, was up
to President Wilson today.
A rapid fire exchange of telegrams
between Secretary of War Baker at
Washington, and" Generals Scott and
Funston in £3 Paso, this morning,
indicated that the administration had
not fully decided on its policy. Ma
jor Sample, commandant at Colum
bus, N. M., was called Into play dur
ing the night and ordered to obtain
General "Pershing's opinion on the
Carranzista demand for immediate
withdrawal."
Scott is said to be lukewarm on
this issue before the international
conference here. Funston is strongly
against yielding to the Mexican de
mand. Both, however, put the mat
ter squarely up to Washington.
Secretary Baker was reported to
have asked the American envoys
what effect withdrawal would have
on the (border and in Mexico. The
two generals replied in a long code
message, understood to have con
tained the opinion that withdrawal
of the United States troops, would
undoubtedly lead to renewed border
raids.
If Scott and Funston receive in
structions from Washington in time,
their second conference with Gen
eral Obregon and the Mexican envoys,
may be held today. Washington's
reply is not expected to be 4 peremp
tory refusal of Obregon's demands.
Further conferences are expected to
be held. It was also assumed from
President Wilson's previous state
ments on the (subject, that the army
would be withdrawn if its retention
meant war with Mexico.
.Pro-interventionists have placed
documents in the hands of General
Scott tending to show Carranza sol
diers would not co-operate to police,
but are themselves looting American
properties in Mexico. W. H. Stuler,
general manager of the National
Mines and Smelter Co., sent Scott a
letter alleging that Carranza soldiers
took all the American ammunition
from the company's employes at Mag
istral and afterward looted the prop
erty.

Conferences between the street
railway company officials and repre

lowest wage that the men were will

The 250,000 or more who walked
to their work this morning, nearly
all accepted the strike as a huge

There will be no effort to run cars,
