storms and floods that followed in Al­
abama and Georgia stood tonight at
nine, with at least 40 persons report­
ed missing aboard small steamers in

Public Health Service Will Seek
to Check in This Way Dis­
ease Epidemic
INFANTILE PARALYSIS
«A8 COST 250 LIVES
New York, July 8.—(After a confer­
ence of federal, state and city health
officials in this city today to discuss
plans to check the epidemic, which
has already cost 205 lives here, Dr.
W. C. Rucker, assistant surgeon gen­
eral of the public health service, re­
turned to Washington tonight to ex­
pedite the importation of monkeys for
experimental purposes.
Dr. Emmerson, health commission­
er, said tonight that while the rate
of increase in patients had been low­
ered, there had been no constant de­
gree thus far and that it could not be
said the epidemic was under control.
The chief problem now confronting
the department is the danger through
the general public of the carrier—a
child or an adult who may have the
disease and without being aware of
the fact, or showing symptoms of it,
can communicate it to others. Keep
away as far as possible from every­
body. You can't tell who the carrier
may be, was the warning tonight of
Dr. George W. Nicholas, head of the
bureau of epidemiology. "There is
entirely too much promiscuous fond­
ling and 'kissing of children."
At a conference today it was de­
cided, Commissioner Emerson said,
that the government experts will
start next Monday to study exhaus­
tively cases in New York City.
OHIO CHILD DIES OP

VILLA JUST RECOVERED,
TAKES COMMAND Of MEN
San Antonio, Texas, July 8.—Fran­
cisco Villa's reported reappearance
in Mexican military affairs was foP
lowed today by the receipt at the bor­
der of a new version of the injuries
he is said to have received. Accord­
ing to the later versions, he was shot
through the leg and only recently le
covered enough to take command of
his men. The report that Villa has
been operating since his recovery,
southwest of Parral, was transmitted
to General Funston at El Paso today,
the same report bearing the new ac­
count of the nature of his wounds.
General Gaston, commanding the
border in the Big Bend district, mov­
ed his forces in such manner as was
best calculated to prevent a raid by
Villa's men or other bandits, but army
men expressed little fear that the
newly organized bandits with Carran
za't. troops near Gimlnez would at­
tempt to strike the border just now.
All reports from the border comtuan
ders indicated quiet.

ISSUED TO PREVENT
OF DEADLY INFANTILE
PARALYSIS OVER THE COUNTRY!
New York, July 8.—Infantile paralysis—horror of doctor and layman—
is threatening to spread its deadly germs beyond the borders of Greater
'New York where an epidemic is reaping hundreds of young lives.
Medical men urge parents to resort to heroic measures to prevent
children from becoming afflicted witfi" the disease, which proves fatal in
nine of ten cases.
SYMPTOMS OF THE DEADLY DISEASE
The disease grows from microbic bacterial which enters through the
nose.
The typical symptoms are stomach trouble or diarrhoea.
The child becomes feverish, irritable and restless. Paralysis of the
legs or arms follows.
Many cases do not run this typical course. A large proportion of
cases do not show paralysis at all. These are particularly dangerous to
the community because the one afflicted spreads the disease to others.
HOW TO GUARD AGAINST DISEASE
•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••ft**
Watch children carefully.
Keep children suffering from nasal catarrh away from large gather
ing of people.
Touch sore lips and nose with fine dry boric acid powder every few
hours.
Irrigate both sides of the nose from a cup—not with a medicine drop­
per—Ave or six times a day with warm water in which five to ten per cent
boric acid has been dissolved.
PASTEURIZE OR E'OIL ALL MILK!
Give the children plenty of handkerchiefs. Boil the handkerchiefs
every day.
Consult you doctor for advice whenever there is the slightest doubt
as to the ailment of your child.

Chairman Smith Expects Fifty
Will Enter by Starting
in Time
St, Paul, Minn,, July 8.—More Twin
City motorists have enlisted in the
automobile tour that starts for Yel
lowstone Park July 20, increasing the
number of entrants to 27. Before the
starting date, however, Chairman W
W. Smith of the committee in charge,
expects the full quota of £0 machines
will'have joined.
Among the latest entries to be ie
ceived were those of Oscar Swoboda,
a St. Paul druggist, and the Reilly
Herz Automobile company of Minne
apolis. Both of these entries speci
fled that1 five passengers will make up
each party. Other participants in the
tour are expected early the coming
week. -.'M'
MandaivN. D., will semi a delega
tion of 25 c&rb to represent the auto­
mobile and commercial clubs of that
city. Three entrants have been se­
cured from Fargo, while a number of
other cities along the route of the
National Parks highway are to be
well represented on the trip.
"There will be some unusually in­
teresting nights for the entertain­
ment of the tourists," said J. P. Har­
dy of Fargo, who is much interested
in the sociability excursion to the
western playground. He has been
working hard on arrangements. Mr.
Hardy said last night that, besides
the bridge dedication ceremonies at
Medora, N"1. O., such places as De
troit, Minnesota, Bismarck, Glen U1
lin, Mandan and Beach N. D., sAd
Miles City, Billings, Glendive, Hun­
ters Hot Springs, Custer and Livings
ton, Mont., will be well prepared for
the visitors.
It was announced last night that an
additional control will be established
at Beach,
!N.
D., and an hour will be
spent there. Beach is the home of
President Reeve of the North Dakota
State Automobile association, who re­
quested this stop.
FIRST STEP IS TAKEN
TOWARD NORMAL BUSINESS
Douglas, Ariz., July 8.—The first
step toward resumption of normal
business relations between Arizona
and Sonora was inaugurated here
day, when several carloads of pro­
visions were taken across the border
for relief of natives at Nacozari.
I. G. Levier, Mexican sonsul I ere,
said that several carloads of food
have been sent to Cananea, and that
George Kirigdon, general superintend­
ed had gone there today to inspect
the Cananea's properties, to deter­
mine also whether Ameriqan em

The embargo extended by the Am
ericans against everything except
food is proving a hardship to the pop
ulation of Cananea.

Army Officials Learning Military
Lessons on the Mexican

RESERVISTS PROMPT
IN ANSWERING CALL
Attention Directed to Effect of
Recent Order of War De­
partment
Washington, July 8.—Pending new
developments in the diplomatic situ­
ation between the United States and
the de facto government of Mexico,
army officials are learning military
lessons by watching the mobilization
Qf the national guard and summoning
of regular army reservists to the col­
ors. Today brought no further indi­
cations as to the course of procedure
Gen. Carranza will suggest to settle
bohler questions. Officials at the
state department are hopeful that
definite progress toward framing a
satisfactory agreement will be made
next week. At the Mexican embassy,
however, it is believed General Car
ranza's suggestion may not be receiv­
ed for several days. Then there prob­
ably will be some loss or time, as
the authorities doubtless will desire
to give Elisio Arredondo specific in­
structions before authorizing hiin to
open formal negotiations with Secre­
tary Polk.
At the war department the belief is
expressed that more than 90 percent
of the 4,000 or 5,000 reg$a*,»iip re­
servists called for active dyty^iijl re­
or 9
fact that a call has been ma'de/it is
thought, will bring most of the.jneA
to the front without ileJ^.^eces
sary for each to receive, fqritya), .noti­
fication. To make certain that other
men passing into the reserve at a
later time realize the seriousness of
their obligation to return to the col­
ors when called, prompt military tri­
als will await any who fail to present
them'fifelvfes'.
T,"'7
Effect Not Easy to Estimate/
The exact effect of the call for re­
serves is not easy to estimate in the
number of men it will produce. It Is
much more far-reaching than the re
serve list would indicate, however,
because in addition to summoning
back to duty the men who have been
out of the active service, for some
time, it probably will operate to sus­
pend all discharged into the reserve
for the time being, except for specific
causes, which unfit soldiers for duly.
Army officers believe that with the
ihcreases. of the regular army author­
ized by the Hay-Chamberlain bill com­
pleted, more than 25,000 men will
pass into the reserve annually. Since
the period of reserve service is four
years, they estimate a minimum re­
serve strength of nearly 25,000 men
will be maintained when the system
is in full working order.
Much attention is being given just
now to the effect of the order dn-act­
ing that members of the nat4.ori?l
guard who have dependent families
be discharged. Under the terms of
the order it is optiona! whether the
department commanders issue a re­
lease from the service or a nrition'al
guard discharge, which nullifies tffe
enlistment from the state, as well as
strikes him off the national guard
rolls altogether. No statement has
been issued by the war department
Many believe absolute discharge
should be granted, and that states
should not enlist men in the guard iA
the future who are not in ever/ way
available for active service.
GUARDSMEN CAPTURE CAR
AND VISIT BALL PARK
Des Moine, July 8.—Fifty members
of the Iowa National guard comman­

claimed they were put off at the In
terurban park when it stopped to let
off persons.
SUGGESTIONS FOR
DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION
Mexico City, July 8.—Several prom­
inent leaders of the defacto govern­
ment met at the national captal today
and it is understood here that prelim­
inary consideration was given to the
suggestion in the latest note from
Secretary Lansing that the Mexican
government propose some practical
plan through which the difficulties
now existing between the two govern­
ments might be solved. While the
meeting was secret, it became known
that two plans were considered. One
plan calls for a telegraphic confer­
ence with direct wires leading from
the conference room in Washington
and the conference room in Mexico
City. The other plan was that the
delegates of the two governments
meet at some isolated town in the
Lnited States, preferably a summer
resort, to discliss plans for joint ac­
tion. *i«im
It is said that none of the con­
ferees expressed any objection to
holding the conference in the Uniited
States, and it is believed when a de­
cision is reached, the plan for a di­
rect meeting will be adopted.

Verified Reports State Every­
thing in Readiness for the
Move
MAJOR HANLEY PRESENTED
WITH HANDSOME CHARGER
There is now not a question of a
doubt but that the First Regiment,
N. D. :N. G. will be entrained and tak­
en to some unknown point on the
Mexican border Monday. The report
that the troops would be on the move
Monday was verified last evening and
it. is expected that preparations will
be well underway early on Monday
morning and the thfee battalion»
miles on their, journey the evening of
the same day.
Supplies and equipment that have
been delaying the departure of the
troops will be on hand today and the
majority of coaches for their trans­
portation are already side-tracked in
the railroad yards.
At just what hour the boys will
leave is still unknown and they may
pull out early Monday morning, al­
though it is expected that the early
portion of that day will be taken up
in breaking camp and loading the
cook stoves, tents and other equip­
ment.
It was rumored last evening that
the first battalion would be on its
way this evening and the others
would follow early Monday morning,
but this report was taken up with re­
liable authority and proven untrue.
Officers and men of every company
are at present prepared to go and are
anxiously awaiting orders to entrain.
The boys are eager for a glimpse of
Carranza's domain and are of the
opinion that they will be stationed on
the border for several months at the
very least
All of the officers and men muster­
ed Into the service of the United
States were examined several days
ago and although many failed to pass
the strenuous tests of the medical
authorities the muster rolls of the
various companies will bring the to­
tal number representing North Dako­
ta well over the thousand mark.
Many of the company ranks were
depleted greatly by the searching ex­
amination conducted by the physi­
cians, Company of Minot suffering
heavily in this respect.
Capt. C. N. Berker of Company K,
Dickinson, has resigned his command
of that company and will be succeed­
ed by First Lieut. J. F. D. Wiley, who
will be succeeded by Second Lieut.
Albert Behonek. Capt. Berker failed
to pass the physical test, being just a
trifle to light in weight. Capt. Berk­
er is one of the ablest company com­
manders in the regiment and his loss
will be felt in many ways. The plucky
leader of the Dickinson boys was
eager to head his men on their trip
to Mexico and during their stay there
and his many friends sympathize
with him in being refused this privil­
ege and honor.
Is Presented With Charger.
Major Hanley of Mandan, in com­
mand of Battalion 3, was yesterday
presented with a handsome black
charger by citizens of Shields. Major
Hanley is one of the best known and
popular commanders with the regi­
ment and is very grateful for the gift.
Shields is a portion of his judicial
district and the people of that town
were eager to show their regard for
him in some material manner and are
of the opinion that they have present­
ed him with something that will be
useful, as well as aiding his appear
ane while on dress parade and In
other maneuvers.

French Attack Uardecourt aiui
The Russian drive for Kovel 'lp
again in full swing along hOtfcj
of the railway to this important
tion point in Volhynia. General
edines reported further iinportai
progress in this movement yesterday.
His lines now have been pushed for­
ward along a front .of. mpre ,than SO
miles In this sector, until
tend irom'fjeteimievka, on the north)
to Gruziapyh. on the sp.utb. the pres­
ent front lying approximately 35 pliie
from Kovel. '.
The Teutonic. resistance, which
week ago had not only stopped 4bi
was driving back the Russians on tlpiji
front, has been notably weakenet'.
Vienna and Berlin have reported-' Aft
orderly retirement here, Dut iPetrq*
grad reports the capture of more that)
2,000 prisoners and mentions the s*\
bering of a number of Austrian! in a
pursuit after the cavalry charged.
The pounding of General Bonth­
mer's army in Galicia also is being
continued by the Russians, who re*
port the capture of another village
and more than 1,000 additional pria^
oners.
The German official statement hti
little to say of the fighting in the Vol­
hynia field of operation. It reports,
however, the repression of .RussiAh
attacks on Field Marshal von Hindeu
berg's lines south of Dvinsk, and the
mowing down of masses of Russians
in their futile efforts to break through
the German lines north of Barano­
vichi, along the front from Zirihf
below Gordische. The battle in thi*
latter sector is still in progress.
There seems little doubt that the
Germans have massed all their ready
available reserves against th British
in northern France and are making
General Haig's forces pay dearly
whatever successes they win.
Berlin does not concede the geini
claimed by the British in their efforts
to reduce the German lines centering
on Contalaison and declares that
enormous numbers' of British dead
were left on the ground before the
German position on this sector, aftef
the Teutonic fire had torn into the
"masses of troops advancing to the at­
tack.
Similar heavy losses were suffered
by the French along the Bichs-SoyA
court front of their offensive move­
ment, according to the German head­
quarters' report.
Heavy fighting continues north ef
Verdun, where the French are deCltl^
ed by Berlin to have suffered heavily
in attmpting to carry positions oa
the Fro'de Ridge.
A Hague dispatch to the Exchange
Telegraph company quotes Maximil­
ian Harden, the noted German -editer,
as writing in Die Zukunft: "Our ene­

fore, after the exhibition of their
strength, just given, they might with­
out humiliation make up account#
and look for a straight line toiwnrd

continue around Verdun.
A fierce preliminary bombardment
was followed by an infantry attack,
which gave the British lodgment in
a strongly defended German position
known as the Bois de Tyrones. The"
German attempted a (strong counter
