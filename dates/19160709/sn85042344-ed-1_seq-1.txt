PETIIOGIIAD, July 8. (Via Um
don, 7:0S p. m.) In Galicia the Rus
sians have niiulo furtlirr progress
against the army of General Count
Von Rothmer. In this theater the
Russians raptured more than one
thousand men yesterday.
Tim missions have pressed haek the
Germans farther In the sertor west of
Czartorysk occupying several more
towns. More than two thousand men
were captured yesterday.
The announcement says:
IH-cssIng Enemy.
"In the region of lower Styr, west
of the Czartorysk sector we are close
ly pressing the enemy. After the hut
tie yesterday we occupied the Gor-odok-Maevichl
station. In yesterday's
combats 75 officers and two thou
sand men were taken prisoners.
"In the region of Optevo a treat
number of Austrlans were sn tiered
during pursuit of the enemy after a
cavalry charge.
."We have occupied the villages of
IjOtrhnievka and Grivn, north of the
market town of Gorodok and ten
Kilometers from the Stokod river.
"East of Monasturzyska (Galicia)
-we took possession of the vrlllago of
Gorov, carrying off more than one
thousand prisoners."
Resistance Swept Away.
-.The Teutonic resistance which a
week ago had not only stopped, hut
was driving Isick the Russians along
this front, apparently has been no
tably weakened. Merlin and Vienna
have reporteil an orderly retirement
here but Pctrngrad claims the cap
ture of more than two thousand pris
oners with numerous gur.s and stores
of munitions and mentions the saber
ing of numbers of Austrlims in a pur
suit after a cavalry charge.
The pounding of General von Both
mer's army in Galicia also is being
continued by the Russians' who report
the capture of another village and of
more than one thousand additional
prisoners.
The German official statement has
little to say of the fighting in the
Volhynlan and Galielan fields of oper
ation. It reports, however, the re
pression of Russian attacks on Field
Marshal von Hindenliurg's lines south
of Dvlnsk and the mowing down of
masse of Russians In their futile ef
forts to break through the German
lines north of Baranovitchl, along

UNREST IS APPARENT
Several Thousand Troops

N0CALE3, Ariz., July 8. From
two to threo hundred Carranza
soldiers and camp followers wero
massacred by Broncho Yaquis early
this week in lower Sonora, according
to stories told today by arrivals from
that part of Mexico. Those of the
do facto detachment not killed by
gunfire, it is said, were burned at the
stake.
While the reports place the num
ber of dead at threo hundred, con
servative estimates made on the
known disposal of troops near the
scene of the massacre put tho loss
at two hundred.
Causes Unrest.
News of the disaster to the Car-
rnnza forco has caused extremo un
rest among the several thousand
Yaquls and Mayos now at Empalme.
While It Is known that large num
bers of Yaquls have Joined tho d
facto army, there has been general
disbelief that the entire Indian na
tion, Including the Broncho or wild
Yaquis, have made peace with the
Mexicans. For that reason the re
ports of the revolting and ensuing
slaughter generally are credited.
General Estrada has had several
thousand troops in the Yaipil valley
holding back the Yauuis and it is
believed the opportunity for the re
ported massacre came about when
Estrada moved his main command
north to Hermosillo and Magdalena
In the course of mobilization

Today brought no tjrthcr intima

At the war department Ihe belief is
