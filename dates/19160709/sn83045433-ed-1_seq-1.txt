(By the Sun News Service.)
El Paso, Texas, July &-Three Ameri
cans killed fourteen Mexican bandits in
a running fight with forty bandits, nine
'miles from El Paso, in New Mexico, this
morning.
The trio of Americans were led by Tom
Perrine. a former United States customs
guard. The two others were Jess Adams
and Alex Rivers. Perrine's horse was
shot from under him during the fight on
the desert, and the Americans were forced
to fight the Mexican bandits in the open,
as there was no cover to be found where
the fight occurred.
First news of the fight this afternoon
came when Perrine telephoned an am
munition store in El Paso and said:
'Send me some thirty-thirty ammuni
tion and some more men. Mexicans raid
ed my place and I've got fourteen of
'em, but the others are getting away."
"Do you mean you have captured four
teen of them?" he was asked.
"Hell, no, we've killed fourteen of the
brown devils," came the laconic reply.
Possemen hastened from El Pasms in

directed against Germany. .
"Judging from the attitude of her gov- j

'Japan is distinctly pro-German.'
Mr. Denby then declared that Japan is
becoming more and more weary of her
alliance with England. "The Japanese
press," he said. "does not conceal that
this alliance would be of no use to Japan
when the ultimate conflict with the Uni

There is a movement urging that the
