Bishop C. W. Nibley, of the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company,
in the City From Salt Lake Yesterday, Announced a
Voluntary and Unsolicited Raise in Schedule, With a
Sliding Scale, That Will Swell Profits of the Farmers
Bishop C. W. Nibley, head of the
great sugar making companies of
Utah and other western states, ar
rived In Grants Pass from Salt Lake
City Saturday morning, accompanied
by his two sons, Merrill and Carlyle
Nibley, and haa spent the day In
looking over the valley. On their
arrival here the gentlemen were met
by Alex Nibley, manager of the local
factory of the Utah-Idaho company.
and by Dr. Nibley, and the four sons
and the father made a comfortable
auto load that held a family reunion
as It toured over the Rogue valley
highways.
The first act of the bishop aa he
stepped from the train, and before
he had left the depot grounds, was
to authorise the Courier to announce
a material Increase In the price which
the company would pay for beets next
season, the Increase being a voluntary
one, made possible because of the
advances In the price of sugar. The
contracts entered Into between the
sugar company and the growers estab
lished a price of $5 per ton for beets
giving IS per cent of sugar. These
were for period of five years bat
when Manager Cwtier wa here re
cently he modified this by reducing
the sugar content required under the
flat price to 1 1 per cent. Now comes
the new proposition of Bishop Nib
ley which makes a radical Increase
In the price to be paid the grower for
beets grown next season, the min
imum being raised from 15 to $5.50
SUPER-OFFENSIVE OF THE ALLIED
S
London, July 8. The super-offensive
of the allied armies entere , its
second week today with the allies
everywhere attacking and maintain
ing their early gains at practically
every point, despite heavy enemy
counter-attacks.
A heavy downpour of rain through
out yesterday afternoon converted the
battle ground on both side of the
Soiume Into a great Bea of mud last
night and seriously hampered opera
tions. Despite this handicap, the
French warbfflpe today claimed slight
further progress south of the Somme
with the taking of 400 prisoners.
The British troops north of the
Somme, after scoring auccesses
against tho Germans In yesterday's
fighting, contented themselves last
night with Improving their positions.
The fighting at the village of Con
talmalson reached a deadlock during
the night with the British holding
the western and the Germans the
eastern part of the ruined town.
No official estimates of either the
German or British losses hove been
made by the war office since the of
fensive began at 7: SO last Saturday
morning, July 1, but the , Germans
are unofficially reported to have lost
from 30,000 to 40,000 In killed and
wounded besides nearly 20,000 taken
prlaonora by the British and French.
Special despatches from Paris today
report that 6,000 Prussian Guards
men, the flower of the kaiser's army,
were killed In the early days of the
fighting, but this may be an exag
geration. General Hatg reported that In the
last tew days the 'British have cap
tured twenty guns, fit machine guns,
numerous automatlo rifles, trench
mortars, mine throwers and "other
war material. ' ' '

15 per cent of sugar, while a further
concession is the agreement to add 10
cents per ton for each one-half per
cent of sugar over 15. In other
words, a eliding scale Is established
tbat makes beets of 16 per cent sugar
content worth $5.70 to the grower,
with Increases for each half per cent
Beets that will analyze 20 per cent
In sugar will return the grower 16.50
per ton. These prices are for the
beets at the factory or on board cars
at shipping point, except where spe
cial arrangementa have been neces
sary because of extra long auto or
rail haul.
After a brief visit to the factory
which Is now in process of building In
South Grants Pass, Bishop Nibley, ac
companied by his four sons and by
P. S. Bramwell, field superintendent
for the company, left for the upper
part of the valley, going by way of
Sara's valley, where they Inspected
the fields of beets growing; In that
district. They later returned from
