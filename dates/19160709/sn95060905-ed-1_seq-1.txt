IN ARIZONA IN

The strangest flagpole on earth un

it bore Uid CI lor aloft. It is a gnarl
ed, grtoesque, giant cactus, in Arizona
known as saguara. that rises from a
hillside back of the postotfice of Price,
Pinal county, a short distance from
the Gila river. Price Is not a-town,
merely a shipping point on the Phoe
nix and Eastern Railroad, where is
dumped freight for a half dozen mines.
Its principal citizen Is Henr) Zeuner,
better known as "Heinrlch," postmas
ter and shipping agent. Though a
Cerman by birth, his Americanism
is of the most fervid sort. He had
early training under the stars and
Blrlpes. In 1&61. when a mere lad.
only ten dajs arrived from his native
Wurttemburg. he enlisted n the Forty-fourth
New York Infantry, later
being transferred t the Fourteenth
New York Cavalry, where he rose to
corporal's rank, serving gallantly
throughout the Civil War. He dearly
loves to Join his Grand Army com
rades in Phoenix on the occasion of
any patriotic celebration, but first hi- I

PRODUCTION OF

WASHINGTON. D. C July 8.
Record productions of all metals are
predicted for the mines and smelters
of Arizona, according to estimates
based on a report made to the United
States geological survey by Victor S.
Helkes, of the Salt Lake Office. I
At the rate they are now working '
they will produce 600,000,000 pounds
of copper against 450,000,000 pounds
In 1915.
A corresponding Increase is noted
in the output of precious metals and
an Increase in that of lead and zinc,
which at the greatly Increased prices
will probably make the total value
of the output In 1916 nearly double
that of 1915, which was about $88,-,
000,000. "" I
