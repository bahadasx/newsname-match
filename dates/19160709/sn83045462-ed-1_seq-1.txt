PARIS. July 8, 10:45 p.m.?The official
communication issued by the war ,
office tonight reads: 1
"North of the Somme, notwithstand- 1
ing the persistent rain and fog, our ,
troops delivered an assault this morning
on the village of Hardecourt, and 1
on Mameion to the north, in co-opera- J
tion with the British army which attacked
from its side the Boise u*
Trones and a farm situated southeast
of that wood. In thirty-five minutes
oifr infantry, by the vigor of the attack,
was in possession of the desired j
objects.
"Two <>rman counter attacks, one '
from the north, the other from the east. '
were launched in the afternoon on
Mameion, conquered by us. but were
broken b\ our fire. The Germans suffered

When the contingent, comprising the
Field Hospital and Signal Corps am

500 soldiers were given a few mi mites
of leg exercises along the border then
was joy in the hearts of all. The con
stant ride with nothing to do but loot
out the windows on scenery that has
been growing more monotonous as th<
trees and other vegetation grew
sparser, ending in a succession o
sandy stretches, has been getting or
the nerves of the soldiers. They an

desirable locality, from which a view
can be had directly into Mexico.
| As these booklets were passed among
I the men they were viewed with intense
i interest. The soldiers were agreeably
surprised to find that they are coming
into a r al lively little place, with a
fine Y. M. C. A. building, theaters, a
first-class hotel, dance halls?and no
saloons. It was also brought to their
attention that in case of any serious
trouble on the border there are at
least two good hospitals at Bisbee and
a strong garrison thirty-six miles west
Since leaving El Paso the train has

SLAYER OF KEEFER
! STILL IS AT LARGE
?
t
Police Admit They Are Baffled
in Attempting to Solve
%
the Mystery.
The murder of Clarence Keefer,
twenty-six years old. in a woods near
Michigan avenue and Sargent road.
Brook land. D. C.. Thursday night, is as
far from being solved as when the body
was discovered Friday morning, according
to the police.
The clue furnished the detectives,
that a man wearing a Palm Beach suit
ar?d a woman wearing a white waist
and dark skirt entered the woods
shortly before Keefer and late that
night were seen to board a Brookland
line car and come into the city had
i not been run down late last night. Detectives
Boyle. Stringfellow. Weber and
? Armstrong have been working on the j
I mystery continuously since Friday '
. morning and Inspector Grant, chief of j
detectives, has been assisting them.
Hunt for Material Witnesses.
Following the information received
from the crew of the car on which the
couple came to the city at 11:12 o'clock
Thursday night, the detectives have
made a search for them. They have
endeavored to learn also the owners
' of a cheap gold Mystic Shrine ring and
a cheap hatpin set with brilliants,
i found near Reefer's body. It is thought
by the officers that the couple they are
I seeking are the owners of the articles
. and they believe that this couple can
[ throw some light on the crime.
Coroner Nevitt called an inquest at
? the District morgue over Reefer's
body yesterday, but it was not completed,
as he decided to give the detectives
until some time this week in
their efforts to locate the person or
persons responsible for the crime.
Wounds Not Self-inflicted.
1 Deputy Coroner William B. Carr, who
performed an autopsy on the body,
' testified that Reefer was shot twice
in the breast. One shot entered the
I right breast and the other near the
heart. He exhibited a .32 caliber bullet
which he said he had removed from
? one of the wounds. There were no
[ powder marks on the clothing or about
the wounds on the body, he testified,
and expressed his belief that the shots
were fired from about three or four
! feet from the victim. The witness
said, in answer to a question of Assistant
United States Attorney Leahy,
that the wounds were not self-inflicted.
Alfred Hardesty of 16 Michigan avenue
northeast, one of the residents of 1
the section, who hoard shots fired ;
Thursday night shortly after 9 o'clock,
testified as to that fact.
Charles Riser, a member of No. 6
truck company and half-brother of
Reefer, testified as to having found the ,
body when he went Friday morning to
find out why Reefer had not returned
home.
Coroner Nevitt then announced the
continuation of the case until some
time next week.
The funeral of Reefer will be held
from the chapel of Thomas S. Sergeon,
1011 7th street northwest, tomorrow at 1
, 2 p.m. Interment will be In Rock Creek
cemetery.

WAUKEGAN, 111., July 8.?Evidence |
In the case of William H. Orpet, the
university student charged with the
murder of Marion Lambert, Lake For- ;
est high school girl, was completed today.
The defense moved that the testimony
of Dr. Ralph W. Webster, a toxicologist,
that the ash heap substance
was potassium cyanide, and that it was
49 per cent pure, be stricken out on the
grounds that no proper analysis was
made.
It was overruled by Judge Donnelly,
and James H. Wilkerson, chief of counsel
for the defense, then made the
usual motion to take the case from
" the Jury and dismiss the prisoner. The
motion was denied.

YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio. July 8?Fifteen
persons were Injured, some serl- j
ously, when a crowded passenger car i
on the Youngstown and Sharon Interurban

revenue measure which proposes *
a special tax upon the copper mining ?
industry. Under the act the business
of copper mining and refining is classified
with the manufacture and sale of

Nine persons are known to
have been killed and at least
forty are reported missing as
a result of Wednesday's
tropical hurricane on the gulf
coast and a series of storms,
tornadoes and floods that followed
in the interior of Alabama
and Georgia. In addition
unconfirmed reports say
that nearly a score of other
persons were killed in isolated
villages near Mobile. Several
days will be required to determine
the correctness of
these reports, owing to prostrated
wire and rail communication
throughout the
storm-swept region. Property
damage probably will reach
five million dollars, crops and

Georgia to the southwestern part of

from the heavy rains of the
past forty-eight hours, have carried
away bridges, destroyed many homes

of live stock. The Ocmulgee river is
rising rapidly at this point.
Soldiers in the state mobilization

the storm. The hospital tent was one
of those blown down, exposing several
patients to the rain.
In Grady county a cyclone cut a

creek, having been isolated when the
water surrounded the Williams Hydroelectric

Alabama Streams Rise Rapidly.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., July 8.?All Alabama
tonight is in the throes of the
tropical storm that began its work last
Tuesday afternoon at Pensacola and
Mobile. This storm, according to the
local weather bureau director, turned
east from northeast Louisiana and
northwest Mississippi and traveled
rapidly to the interior of north Alabama.
Tonight it was centered in the
vicinity of Birmingham, where damage
is feared because of the fact that telegraph
wires began to go down between
that city and Montgomery about 8
o'clock.
The torrential rains in the central
part of the state, and as far north as
the natural watershed of the state,
have caused all streams to rise rapidly.
The Alabama Power Company sent
word to the local weather bureau that
fifteen gates would be opened Friday
in an endeavor to hold back as much of
the flood waters as possible. Because
of excessive rains late Friday afternoon
it became necessary to open twentythree
of these gates, letting an unexpected
volume of water into the rivers.
Late this afternoon the power company
notified Weather Observer Smyth that
the gates were being closed in an enfieavor
to hold the waters as much in
iheck as possible, but excessive rains
ibove made the closing process slow.
State Convicts Marooned.
One hundred state convicts at convict
