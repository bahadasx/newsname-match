be stationed at this crossing. Mr.
Ilodovitz states that the street is
narrow there and when trains are in,
the cab men and jitney drivers have
traffic completely blocked, so that
it is extremely difficult to see when
a train is approaching. There is per
haps more driving done on Washing
ton street every 24 hours than on any
other street in the city and the
city commissioners will be asked to
safe guard the public by gates or

DESIRE QUICK
AND PRACTICAL
SETTLEMENT
DEALINGS WITH MEXICO WILL
BE BROUGHT TO A SPEEDY
SOLUTION THROUGH AMICA
BLE ARRANGEMENTS.
Washington, July 8. Inception of
the diplomatic conversations which it
is hoped will result in a settlement of
the differences between the United
Slates and the de facto government
of Mexico, awaited Friday night a
suggestion from General Carranza as
to how they should proceed. State
department officials believe more can
be accomplished through Informal
conferences 'betwen Eliseo Arredondo,
Mexican ambassador designate, and
Frank L. Polk, acting secretary of
state, than by a more formal ex
change of views. They are willing to
accede, however, to some other plan
should the de facto government pro
pose it.
Mr. Arredondo transmitted to his
government Friday a brief and friend
ly note from Secretary Lansing ex
pressing gratification over the turn
affairs between the two governments
has taken and accepting proposals for
diplomatic settlement of points In
dispute. The communication was ap
proved by the cabinet before It was
sent to the Mexican embassy.
Speed Urged.
Officials did not fail to note Secre
tary Lansing had laid stress upon the
desirability of giving quick and prac
tical consideration to the Immediate
conditions along the 'border which
have been 'a source of controversy.The
language of the communication plain-
ly Indicates a speedy solution of that
prouiem win oe songm,
whatever
I time may be allowed afterward to
find a means of aiding the de facto
government in restoring normal eco-
, time may
nomic conditions tnrougiiout .Mexico.
The definition of the border dispute
submitted by General Carranza in his
note suggesting negotiations for a
settlement apparently has been found
acceptable by the Washington gov
ernment. That virtually narrows the
immediate objective to the negotia
tors to consideration of the "reason
able" anxiety of the Urme.l States fir
the security of its frontier on the one
hand and the desire or the tie facto
government for early w. iJ.-av.il of
American troops from M'j.sico on tho
other.
Bandits Still Active.
The Carranza government today
warned, at the director, nf General
Carranza, that bandits which recently
defeated government troops at Cur
ralitos were headed toward this
Bend region in Texas.
At the same time the state depart
ment received a report from ail Am
erican in Mexico Miat he nh.1 seen
and talked with Viha near Corralito
a few days before the fight reported
In the Carranza message.
Officials were pleased at the indica
tion that General Carranza was dis
posed to seek co-operation in protect
ing the border. They saw in the warn
ing, however, a frank admission that
bandits still are active in the terri
tory over which the de facto govern
ment repeatedly has claimed com
plete military control. This may have
an Important bearing on the diplo
matic discussions.
The state department received In
formation Friday that many Ameri
cans who hastened to the border or
the sacoast when the crisis seemed
grave, already are returning to the
interior of Mexico. Department of-
ficials are using every effort to dis
suade them from this course.

EOKEBIEIT
AID FOR GOOD
RDADS II II. S.
SEVENTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
WILL BE EXPENDED -BY THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE
VARIOUS STATES.
For the past twenty years Colonel
Sidney Suggs, ex-state highway com
missioner of Oklahoma, has advocated
federal aid for the construct inn of
permanent roads, iincr with this end
in view he has labored unceasingly,
that he might convince the lawmakers
of tho nation that good 'roads were far
more important to the nation than
the efforts they were expending to
make navigable rivers out of dry
streams and spending millions of dol
lars annually for this for the most
part useless purpose.
Colonel Suggs has always maintain
ed that money so spent was a col
ossal demonstration of peanut peni
winkle pork barrel political proposi
tions, lie stated yesterday morning
that when lie went to the United
States senate he would feel no proud
er than he did when he learned that
his pet measure had been enacted
into law, and that the states would
now be in position to do permanent
construction and maintenance of high
ways. This applies more especially
to the younger states of the union
where practical road building has
been for the most part sadly neglect
ed, and now is the time to organize
and build educational miles of roads
such as he organized at the Seminole
high school and built in 1912.
Following is the text of the plan
as adopted by congress, and which has
received the signature of President
Wilson:
Co-operation between the national
government and the states In high
ways improvement has begun on a
country-wide program.
In the next five years 5150,000,000
will be expended on a half and half
plan, upon arterial roads selected by
the highway authorities of the forty
eight states, subject to the approval
of the secretary of agriculture.
The co operative plan became ef
fective when President Woodrow Wil
son attached his signature to the con
crete proposition which resulted in
the merging by the conferees of the
two bills passed by congress, the sen
ate and house having adopted differ
ent measures. In greater degree the
senate bill found approval, for it di
rected quite positively the expendi
ture of the money una required the
maintenance of the roads, after
construction, by imposing a dis
continuance of further funds fnr neg
lect in this important matter.
In the amalgamation of the two
measures the conferees of the senate
were Senator John II. Uankhead,
chairman of its committee on post
offices and post roads, and Senators
Claude A. Swanson or Virginia, and
Charl.s E. Townsend of Michigan.
Representatives D. W. Shackleford,
chairman of the committee on roads,
and E. W. Saunders of Virginia were
the spokesmen for the house.
With the federal aid convention
conducted by the American Automo
bile association in Washington, Janu
ary 16-17, 1912, started the effort
which finally resulted In the law just
enacted. Congress answered this
first gathering by the creation of a
joint committee of the senate and
house, authorized to investigate upon
the desirability and feasibility of fed
eral aid to the states. Its report was
distinctly favorable.
Combining their energies, the Am
erican Association of State Highway
Officials and the American Automo
bile association urged the fundamen
tals contained in the Bankhead
Shatkleford legislation accomplished.
Chairman George C. Diehl of the A.
A. A. good roads board thus com
ments on this new policy of condi,ft
ing federal and state funds in roads
building:
"The majority of the states have
provided for definite systems of state
highways, which they are construct
ing as rapidly as available means per
mit. Every effort should be directed
now toward having the federal funds
apply on these state systems and
not frittered away on countless little

The French made a further
advance last night on the
iSomme front near Belley-en-Santerre
and Estress, the Paris
war office announced today, al
though the gains in this sector
were not large on account of
the bad weather. Several hun
dred German prisoners were
captured.
News received in Berlin to
day from the western front
throws little light on the oper
ations during the past twenty
four hours, but advices show
that the fighting was most in
tense at Thiepval, around Hem,
and in the region from eight to
ten miles south of the Somme.
The British, according to the
Berlin reports, succeeded in
getting a foothold several times
in Thiepval, only to be ejected
from the ruins of the villa. The
losses were "extraordinarily
heavy."
The Russian advance in the
Czartorysk region, in which
the attacking Germans, were
thrown back yesterday, has
been pushed further back, ac
cording to Petrograd. The vil
lages of Dolzyea and Cruziatyn
were captured by the Russians.
The German troops on both
sides of the Somme repulsed
with heavy losses the attacks
by the British and French, the
Berlin war office announced to
day. Heavy attacks by the Rus
sians against the German
troops of Prince Leopold in
Baranovics region were repuls
ed with a loss of one thousand
in dead, according to a Berlin
statement. The Russian as
saults northwest of Buczacz in
Galicia were also fruitless and
in Volhynia, the Germans gain
ed an advantage south of
Lutsk, according to Berlin.
