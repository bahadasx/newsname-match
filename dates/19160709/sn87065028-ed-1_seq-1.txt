UUAKI) OF HONOR
KSCORTSIIHAKSI-
Minister Pay High Tribute to
Soldier and Stores Close' for
Funeral.
With military honor and with the
stores in the business district closed
while the funeral was in progress,
the body of Capt. W. S. Mullins,
commander of the Columbus Rifle
men, who died in Jackson last Wed
nesday afternoon shortly after hav
ing undergone an operation for ap
pendicitis, was laid to rest Friduy
afternoon, funeral services having
been held at the First Baptist church
and interment having taken place at
Friendship cemetery.
The obsequies took place at 5:30
o'clock Friday afternoon, and al
though the day was dark and dis
mal there was a large concourse of
people present, the congregation
having filled almost to capacity the
spacious auditorium of the temple of
worship. Dr. J. L. Vipperman, the
pastor of the church, was the offici
ating clergyman and was assisted by
Rev. W. S. Slack, pastor of St.
Paul's Episcopal church, and Rev.
W. L. Duren, pastor of the First
Methodist church. Dr. Vipperman
delivered an impressive sermon and
took occasion to pay high tribute to
the dead soldier, having praised him
for his patriotism, for his loyalty
and for his unfailing devotion not
only to his country but to his family,
his friends and his duty.
It was impossible for the Colum
bus Riflemen to semi a guaH of
honor from Jackson, as the compa
ny was almost momentarily expect
ing a call to the front, but a delega- j
tion made up of Meridian militia
men accompanied the body from
that city to Columbus. This delega
tion consisted of Capt. J. A. Ham
mond, First lieutenant H. E. Hall,
Privates G. P. Page, Paul Temple
ton, W. J. Buie, Harry Nelson, C, E.
Bardwell, J. C. Powers, W. C. Beg
gerby, C. Robinson, J. G. Griffin, Al
bert Achamber and E. L. Hancock.
The militiamen, as well as practical
ly the entire membership of Tom
bigbee Lodge No. 2K Knights of
Pythias, of which deceased has been
a member for many years, attended
the services at the church and
marched on either side of the hearse
as that vehicle wended its way to
the cemetery. As the body was low
ered into the grave taps were sound
ed and a military salute was fired.
A pathetic feature of the funeral
was the enforced absence therefrom
of Mr. and Mrs. R. A. Mullins, par
ents of the dead militiaman, who
are in Denver attending the bed
side of a younger son, Mr. Arthur
Mullins, who has been ill with ty
phoid feyer for several weeks past.
The gentlemen who noted as pall
bearer were: Messrs. B. A. Lincoln,
Mynk Cox, Louis Shull D .T. Ses
MCis Kennith Harrison art M. ('
Vandiver. The flower committee
consisted of the following ladies:
Mr3. Ward Richards, Mrs. B. A. Lin
coln, Miss Julia Cox and Miss Sua
Mae Lincoln. .
The following message of sympa
thy was received from Governor
Bilbo by Mr. V. M. Higgins, brother
in-law "of Capt. Mullins:
"Please convey to the father,
mother and relatives of Capt. Mni
lins my profound sympathy in their
bereavement personally and as gov
ernor, l know that our state Has
sustained a great loss and the milita
ry arm of our government one of its
finest officers.
Theo. G. Bilbo,
Governor
The following tribute to the late
Capt, Mullins appeared in the Jack
son Clarion-Ledger of Thursday:
"A beautiful tribute was paid the
memory of Captain Mullins last
night when the remains were escort
ed to the train by his company un
der command of Capt. Harper ' of
Natchez and the regimental officers
under the command of
Colonel Boyd.

Telephone messages from

Luxapaliia creek is now with

the Columbus Lumber Company

A severe rain and wind storm
swept over the South Atlantic, coast
during several days of the past
week, and this section got the
"drippings," rain having fallen here
almost incessantly for more than CO
hours, with a total precipitation of
6.93 inches for the period. The
heavy rain naturally resulted in a
rapid rise in the Tombigbee river,
which rose something like 17 1-2
The greatest damage resulting
from the storm in this immediate
vicinity was sustained by the crops,
cotton, corn and other plants hav

The railroads, as is usual in such
coses, were the mst severe suffer

day that a passenger train on the
Southern Railway wa3 water-bound

been so, bad on some roads that no
attempts were made to run trains.
The Louisville and Nashville pene

there were so many washouts on the
line that train service south of
Montgomery was abandoned soon
after the storm made its appear

property damage there being estim

SECURITY OF BORDER AND
WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS
ARE POINTS TO SETTLE .
Washington, July 8. Beginning
of the diplomatic conversation which
i . i . i 11 t. .1 . , 1
ment of the differences between the
United States and Mexico is awaiting
a suggestion from Gen. Carranza as
how they should proceed. State De
partment officials believe more can
be accomplished through informal
conferences between Elisco Arre
dondo, Mexican ambassador desig
nate, and Frank L. Polk, acting sec
retary of state, than by a more for
mal interchange of views. They are
willing to accede, however, to some
other plan, should the de facto gov
ernment propose it.
Mr. Arredondo has just tranxmit
ted to his government a brief and
friendly note handed him by Secre
tary Lansing, expressing graification
over the turn affairs between the
two governments have taken and ac
cepting proposals for diplomatic set
tlement of points in dispute. The
communication was approved by
the cabinet before it was sent to
the Mexican embassy.
The text follows:
"Sir I have the honor to ac
knowledge the receipt of your
communication of July 4, 1916, in
which you transcribe a note address
ed to me by the secretary of foreign
relations of your government, and
to request that you will transmit to
him the following reply:
"Mr. Secretary I have the honor
to acknowledge the receipt of your
courteous note transmitted to me
by Senor Arredondo on the 4th, in
which you refer to my notes of
June 20 and 25, and to assure you
of the sincere gratification of my
government at the frank statement
of the difficulties which have un
fortunately arisen in our relations
along the international boundary,
and the unreserved expression of
the desire of your government to
reach an adjustment of these diffi
culties on a broad and equable ba
sis. The same spirit of friendship
and of solicitude for the continu
ance of cordial relations between
our two countries inspires my "ov-
ernment, which equally desires an
immediate solution of the matter, of
' difference whii-h hnv
both governments.
"It is especially pleasing to rry
government that the de facto gov
ernment is disposed to give quick a
well as practical consideration in a
spirit of concerd to the remedy
which may be applied to the existing
conditions. Reciprocating the samo
desire, the government of the Unit 1
States is prepared immediately to
exchange views as to a practical plan
to remove finally and prevent a re
currence of the difficulties which
have been the source of the contro
versy." ,
