Chief Problem.
The chief problem now confronting
the health department, officials said,
is the danger to the general public
of the "carrier." A child or adult
who may have the disease and without
being aware of the fact, or showing
symptoms of it. can carry it to
others. It is hoped by experiments
upon monkeys to determine how the
disease is spread.
Dr. Emerson said the department Is
doing everything within Its resources
to cope with I ho plague, but that the
service can be improved.
Keep Isolated.
"Keep away as far as possible from
everybody. You can't tell who the
carrier may be," was the warning tonight
of Dr. George Nicholas, head
of the bureau of epldemiollgy.
"There is entirely too promiscuous
fondling and kis3ing of children."
Commissioner Emerson announced
that with the aid of Dr. S. S. Goldwater
former health commissioner,
hospital associations are being mobilized.

NOGALES, Ariz., July 8?From
200 to 300 Carranza soldiers and
camp followers were massacred by;
Yacjui Indians this week in j
lower Sonora, acordlng to a report i
here today. Those of the defactoj
detachment not killed by Runflre, it;
wan said, were burned at the stake. ;
While reports place the number of |
dead at 300, conservative estimates1
made on the known disposal of troops
near the scene of the massacre, put
the loss at 200.
News of the disaster to the Carranza
force has caused extremo uneasiness
among several thousand1
Yaquis and Mayos dow at Emplame.
While It Is known that large
numbers of Yaquis have Joined the
defacto army, there has been general
disbelief that the entire Indian nation,
including the Broncho of wild
Yaquis, have made peace with the
Mexicans. For that reason the reports
of the revolt and ensuing
slaughter generally are connected.
General Estra has had several
thousand troops in the Yaqul valley
to hold back the Yaquis, and it is believed
the opportunity for the reported
massacre came about when
Estra moved bis main command
north to Hermoslllo and Magdalena
In the coruse of mobilization maneuvers.
