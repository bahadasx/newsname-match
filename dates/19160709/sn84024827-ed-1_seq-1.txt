OUTCOME HELD OF
VITAL IMPORTANCE
Victory For Villa Would
Mean Revolt Of Carranza
Supporters, . Believed. De
tails Are Lacking
(By Review Leased Wire.)
EL PA0, July 8. Carranza forces
today engaged the Yillistas who raid
ed Jimenez, Chihuahua, on the I'rbina
Ranch, southwest "of Jimenez, accord
ing to meagre reports reaching here
tonight. The advices received by
private individuals contained no de
tails. General Francisco Gonzales, de
facto commander in Juarez, while un
able confirm the reports, asserted
that a battle had been expected mom
entarily. Upon the result of the engaeement
depends the domination of the Chi-huahua-Durango
border, and It is con
ceded here that should the Villistas,
following recent victories at Corrolitos
and Jimenez, again be successful it
might result in numbers of peons of
the district who secretly sympathize
with the outlaws flocking to their
standard. The de facto government
is throwing its every available re
source into the attempt to crush the,
bandits, 1200 cavalrymen under Gen
eral Domingo Arrieta, supported by
800 infantry facing the outlaw com
mand, estimated at about l&OO and
under Calixto Contreras.

HAIBE BEATS DE PALMA
AT GRAND RAPIDS TRACK
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.. July 8.
Eddie Haibe won the first annual 100
mile" automobile race here this after
noon. Ralph De Palma was second,
and Andy Burt was third. The race
was delayed more than an hour by a
heavy rain.
Undeterred by rain and fog, the
Franci-British offensive continues
fiercely north of the Somnie. The
British, in conjunction with the
French, sre reported to have advanced
half a mile on Saturday, against the
Germans. General Haig's forces also
have made considerable progress at
Contalmaison. where their position
now is considered "satisfactory.
The French in an attack on Harde
court and Mamelon gained the desired
nositions in a little more than half an
hour. The Germans counter attacked
twice aeainst the Mamelon positions,
but were repulsed. The French in
flicted heavy losses and took 260 pri
soners. Artillery bombardment con
tinue around Vrdun.
A fierce nreliminarv bombardment
by the British followed by an infan
try attack which gained them lodge
ment in a strongly defended German
position known as the Bois de
Thrones. The Germans a'ttemoted a
strong counter attack to regain this
position, but. according to the British
official statement, it broke down un
der the British fire.
The Russian drive for Kovel Is
a?ain in full swing along both sides
of the railroad from Sarney to this
important Junction point in Volhynla.
General Kaledines reported further
important fighting in this movement.
His lines now have been pushed for
ward alone a front of more than 30
"fie in this sector until they extend
from Letchnievka on the north to
Gruziatyn on the south, lying approx
imately 35 miles from Kovel.
The Teutonic resistance, which a
week ago had not only stopped but
was driving back the Russians along
tis front, apparently has been com
pletely weakened. Berlin and Vienna
have reported and orderly retirement
here but Petroerad claims the capture
of more than 20.000 prisoners, with
numerous guns and stores and men

trians in a public street after a caval

PROTESTS TAX ON
COPPER SMELTERS.
BUTTE. July 8. From every
part of Montana today a protest
was directed lJ the state's delega
tion in Congress against the pass
age of the general revenue mea
sure that proposes a special tax
upon the copper mining industry.
Under the act the business of
copper smelting and refining is
classified with the manufacture
and sale of munitions of war.
The Butte chamber of com
merce today telegraphed the
Montana delegation at Washing
ton that the proposed tax would
an.'junt to more than 10 per cent
of the total net income of the
copper business, that it was dis
criminatory and wholly unjust
ified as a legislative measure'.-.
The protest declares that the
whole state of Montana will be
vitally and unjustly affected by
the discrimination imppsedi upon
its principal industry. It is esti
mated that under the provisions
of the proposed act 'one company
alone operating in this state
would pay not less than $3,000,
000 in special taxes.

Open Convention At Denver!
Spurns Endorsement Of G
O. P. Candidate After
Spirited Debate
(By Review Leased Wire.)
DENVER, July 8. Progresseives of
Colorado at an "open meeting" to
night, declined to endorse Charles E.
Hughes for president, decided to con
tinue the state organization and au
thorized Chairman C. P. Dodge to call
at a later date a state assembly, at
which it is expected state and county
tickets will be placed in the field this
fall.
The declination of Hughes' endorse
ment took the form of a resolution in
which it was recommended to the
state central committee that no in
dorsement be. made of the action of
the national committee and the Pro-!
gressives1 let to' express their Individ-1
ua! convictions upon national issues. I
The central committee at a later j
meeting followed the recommenda
tion. The debate at times grew spirited,
but the action taken was practically
unanimous.
The coming state assembly Is to be
held in Denver at a date to be select
ed by, and at the call of Clarence P.
Dodge, state chairman.
Military Chiefs Keenly Watch
Effect Of Guards Mobiliza
tion And Calling Of The
Reserves
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 8. Pending
new developments in the diplomatic
situation betwen the United States
and the de facto government of Mex
ico, army officials are learning mili
tary lessons by watching the working
out of the national guard mobiliza
tion and the summoning of regular
army reservists to the colors.
Today brought no further intima
tions from Mexico City as to the
course of procedure General Carranza
will suggest for diplomatic confer
ences to settle border questions. Of
ficials at the state department are
hopeful that definite progress toward
arranging a satisfactory agreement
will be discussed next week. At the
Mexican embassy, however, it is be
lieved General Carranza's suggestions
may not be received for several days.
Then there probably will be some loss
of time, as the de facto authorities
doubtless will desire to give Eliseo
Arredondo, ambassador - designate,
specific Instructions before authoriz
ing him to open informal negotiations
with Acting Secretary Polk and the'
preparation of these will require time.
At the war department the belief Is
expressed that more than 90 per cent
of 4000 to 5000 regular army reservists
called for reserve duty will report
promptly. Publication of the fact that
a call bad been made, it is thought,
will bring most of the men to the
front without the delay necessary for
each to receive formal notification. To
make certain that other men passing
into the reserve at a later time real
ize the seriousness of their obligation
to return to the colors when called,
prompt military trials will await any
who fail to present themselves.
The exact effect of the call for re
servists is not easy to estimate in the
number of men it will produce. It is
