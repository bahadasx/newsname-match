Washington, .Inly S. Pending new
developments 1" tlie diplomatic tutua
tion between the 1'iiited States ami
the df facto government of Mexico,
hi my ufficlulH are learning military
lessons by watching the working out
of the national guard mobilization and
die MUiuniutiiiir f regular army
Krvists to the color.
Today brought no further tulimu
tinns from Mexico City as to the
course of procedure General Ciuratiza
will suggest for diplomatic confer
ences to settle border iiuostUms. Of
ficials at the slate department are
hopeful that definite progress toward
fraiiitnK a satisfactory agreement will
he m.ide next weeli. At the Mexican
embassy, however, it Is believed Gen
eral Carranzu's suggestions may not
be received for several days. Then
there probably will be some loss of
time, as the de facto authorities
doubtless will desire to give Kliseo Ar
ledondo, ambassador-designate, spe
cific Instructions before uuthori.ing
him to open formal negotiations with
AOing Secretary Polk, and the prep
aration of these will reijuire time.
At the war department the belli f is
expressed that more than !Ml per
cent of ihe 4.00 1 to 5.000 regular army
reservists called for reserve duty will
report promptly. Publication of the
fnct that h call lias been made, it Is
thought, will bring most of the men
to the front without the delay neces
sary for each to receive formal notl
. ficHtion. To make certain that other
tin ii passing into the reserve at u Inter
tune realize, the, seriousness of their
obligations to return to the colors
when called, prompt military trials
will await any who fail to present
themselves.
The exact effect of the cull for re
servists is not easy to estimate In the
number of men It will produce. U i
much more far-reach inn than the re
serve list would indicate, however, be
cause In addition to summoning back
to duty men who have been out of
active service for some time, it prob
ably will operate to suspend all dis
charges into the reserve list for the
time being-, except for specific causes
which unfit soldiers for duty.
25.1MI0 Itcserus Annually.
Army officers believe that with the
increase of the return army author
iz'd by tho Hay-Chamberlain bill
completed, an uvi rage of more than
-"i.'Hio trained men will pass into the
reserve annuiiU.1; Since the period of
reserve service is four years, they es
timate that as minimum reserve
strength of nearly 75,000 men will be
constantly maintained when the sys--tem
Is in full working order.
Much attention Is being given just
now to the effect of the order direct -lug
that members of the national
guard who have, dependent families,
be discharged. Indcr the tcruiH of
the order, it Is optional whether de
partment commanders issue only u
release froih federal service or a for
mal discharge which would nullify the
soldiers' contract enlistment with the
state from which he runic, as well,
and. and strike him off the national
guard rolls altogether. No statement
1ms been issued by the war depart
ment as to the course to be followed.
Many officers believe that absolute
d sohargc should be granted and that
the Viii'ioiiB states should be urged not
to enlist men in the guard in future,
win, are not in every way available for
activ p service.
