State Department Officials
Believe Vessel Entitled
to All Privileges.
WILL NOT INTERFERE
Government Not to Concern
Itself About the Return
Cargo of Deutschland.
Washington. July II. -State de
partment officials today expressed
Ix-lief. based npon unofficial infor
mation that the Deutschland would
be declared a peaceful, unarmed
merchantman and entitled to all
privileges of an ordinary cartro
carrier.
The state de-partment, it was offi
cially declared, will not concern itself
with reported objections by Canadian
nickel interests to exportation of nick
el on the Deutschland. Agreements of
American purchasers of Canadian
nickel not to reexport the metal, acting
Secretary Polk explained, was purely
private and no resort could be had to
the state department to interfere with
nickel shipments on the German,
supersubmarine.
Allies Protect.
Representations have been made to
the state department by the British
and French embassies setting up the
claim that the German merchant sub
marine Deutschland is potentially a
war ship, even though designed and
used as a merchantman.
The department will take the em
bassies' views under consideration in
connection with the report of Captain
Hughes, the
Ameri can n a vat exrmrTtnsmTom ufeTTa h"
who is making a physical examination
of the submarine.
Before the arrival of the Deutsch
land, acting upon press reports that a
submarine was due at an American
port, Colville Barclay, the British
counsellor and charge d' affaires in
the temporary absence of Sir Cecal
Spring-Hioe, communicated to Secre
tary Lansing the position of his gov
ernment regarding the use of any un
derwater craft in commercial service.
At;ain yesterday Mr. Barclay in addi
tion to notifving the department of the
arrival of the Deutschland to lay theitne other Tirpitz writers last spring,

bassador, also has been in communi

Anjr Sab a Warship.
From the allies' point of view, any
submarine is essentially a warship.
The 1'nited States, Great Britain and
France agree on the doctrine that it is
illegal to' change the character of a

Carranza Is
Told to Open
Up His Case
Washington, July 11. General Car
ranza has been notified that negotia
tions for the settlement of the border
difficulties need not await the return
of Secretary Lansing from his vaca
tions. It is expected Carranza will propose
a formal conference, rather than in
formal conversations between Ambas
sador Arredondo and the state depart
ment. American officials will accede
to any plan which assures quick ac
tion. War department officials discounted
rumors of a revolt in the Carranza
garrison at Chihuahua City. The
Mexican embassy formally denied the
report.
Reports credited to American refu
gees that two American sailors were
killed recently at Tampico when their
launch was fired upon by Carranza
soldiers, were denied by the state and
navy departments.
Acting Secretary Polk attended the
cabinet meeting today and reported
on the informal conversations he has
had with Mr. Arredondo.
SUB VISIT GALLED
A GERMAN THREAT
British Regard Submersibie's Trip As
Berlin Way of Supporting Con
tentions of Von Tirpitz.
London. July 11. "We are quite
ready to join in the laugh against our
selves and to applaud the skill and
daring of "the captain who appears to
us as a sportsman and has earned his
laurels cleanly," says the Manchester
Guardian, referring to the German sub
marine Deutschland.
The Guardian says that plans for
submarines of 3,000 to 4,000 tons ex
isted in Germany and England before
the war but that such vessels were
not built because of the time required
to submerge them and the impossibility
of submerging in shallow watet. It
points out that the Australian suftraa-
Dardanelles and says that if the cap
tain and crew of the Deutschland are
members of the imperial German navy,
the submarine may be dealt with as a
naval auxiliary. Otherwise she is a
blockade runner which could be or
dered to stop and if she attempted, to
submerge it would be justifiable to
sink her.
"It is unlikely," the Guardian con
tinues, "that the moral of the appear
ance in American waters of a German
submarine will be missed after the
threats of Count von Reventlow and
jar away for Germany s arm to reach
her. Although the Deutschland may
be disarmed, she is none the less a
threat to the American navy."

Trones wood.
The statement follows:

July 11 (noon, via London, 3:27 p. m.)
After the assault of last night the
British remain in possession of Con
talmaison, holding it against German
counter attacks and furious shell fire.
Fighting continued through the night
from Ovillers and La Boisselle to
Trones wood. The British, bombing
their wav forward, gained considera-
bly in Mametz and took all except the
point of the iiercely disputed pear-
shaped Trones wood, clearing the way
with each step toward the German
second line in the ridges beyond.
The infantry is at such close quar
ters in the woods that the guns on
either side are firing at the first line
for fear of hitting their own men.
Overhead shells are screaming past
into the reserves to keep assistance
from those in the front positions.

Paris, July 11 (12:15 p. m.) The
situation remained unchanged on the
Somme front last night.
Today's war office statement says
it has been ascertained that south of
the Somme the French in the last two
days have taken more than 1,300 pris
oners. On the Verdun front the Germans
launched an attack at 4 o'clock this
morning on the French positions from
Fleury to a point east of Chenois.
They penetrated advanced French
trenches at some points, but were ex
pelled immediately by a counter at
tack. West of the Meuse there was active
artillery fighting in the neighborhood
of Avoceurt and Chattancourt.
Northeast of Ve-ho the Germans ex
ploded four mines, the craters of
which eventually were occupied by
the French.
French Statement.
The communication follows:
"On both sides of the Somme the
night passed in quiet. Prisoners tai
en by us south of the Somme the last
few days is now more than 1,300.
"On the left bank of the Meuse (Ver
dun front) there were severe artillery
engagements in the sectors of Avo
court and Chattancourt. To the right
of the river the lombardment yester
day of our positions from Fleury to
a point east of Chenois was redoubled
in intensity. At 4 o'clock this morn
ing the Germans delivered an attack
over th whole front thus bombarded.
East of Fumin wood and Chenois wood
the enemy gained a foothold in our
advanced' trenches, but immediately
was ejected entirely by counter at
tacks. Elsewhere our curtain of fire
and our machine guns broke up the
attacks of the enemy. The bombard
ment continues in this region.
"West of Pont-au-Mousson a sur
prise attack delivered by the enemy
against one of our trenches west of
Mortmare wood was broken up com
pletely. "In Lrraine, after spirited artil
lery activity, the Germans attacked
the salient in our line east of Reillon
and succeeded in penetrating portions
of our first line over a front of 200
metres.
"In the Vosges, south of Lusse, an
attack of the enemy was broken up
with grenades. North of La Fon ten

the enemy enabled us to penetrate
first line trenches and a support

ORPET'S LAWYER
TELLS PLIGHT OF
BOY IN HIS PLEA
Attorney Flanna tiives Vivid Terbal
Tictnre of Youth's Position in
Argument for Defense.
"""vTaukegan, 111., July ll.-Argument
for the defense following the-opening
tf that for the state yesterday was
begun today by Leslie P. Hanna in be
half of William H. Orpet, charged with
the murder of Marian Lambert.
"The defendant," said Mr. Hanna,
"took the stand as a fair witness. The
shock of his arrest for Marian's death
had worn off. He was no longer the
frightened youth who, without counsel,
talked erratically perhaps just after his
arrest. It would have been folly for
him to have taken the stand unless he
was to tell the truth and the whole
truth.
"When he was arrested the whole
current of his life was changed," went
on the lawyer. "Officers of the law
besieged him and the newspapers
cried "murder, murder.' It seemed to
him as if the whole world were ar
rayed against him. He simply did his
best until the adrice to which he was
entitled came to his assistance."
Mr. Hanna referred to Attorney Jos
lyn's cross examination of Orpet as
"brutal and unfair" and warned the
jurors that they were not to remember
Mr. Joslyn's insinuating questions but
Orpet's replies to them.
Mr. Hanna walked up close to the
jury box and spoke in r very soft, con
fidential tone so that those in the aud
ience could not hear him. Speaking of
the defendant's flight from the girl's
body he said :
"Do not place too much weight on
this. The lad of 20, incapable of con
fronting such a shock and tho expo
sure it promised, ran. The same lad,
grown to maturity, would have stayed.
"After all, the backbone of the state's
case was founded on the belief that
the cyanide of potassium, which killed
Marian Lambert, was a part of that in
the greenhouse over which the defend
ant's father had control. That factor
has disappeared, and with its disap
pearance appeared the innocence ; of
this defendant."
Mr. Hanna spoke for only an hour
and a quarter. He was followed by
State's Attorney Ralph J. Dady for the
state. He dwelt particularly on the in
ferences to be drawn from letters of
the defendant to Marian.

PERPETUAL ERUPTION
Big Fight on
Over Secret
Gas Process
Chicago, July 11. The claims of
Layton O. Sherman, an East Chicago
Inventor as the originator of a secret
process for the manufacture of gaso
line, will be the center of a legal battle
which openeiI"Eere today"before Judge
Jesse A. Baldwin in the circuit court.
It is said that many millions of dol
lars may acme from the process and
the suit is expected to be hotly con
tested. W. E. D. Stokes of New York; Ellis
Crawford of Charleston, W. Va., and
Frederick A. N'orris, .a Michigan oil
man, claim equal rights with Sherman
in his patented process which, it is
declared, will "revolutionize the man
ufacture of gasoline from crude oil,"
by virtue of a contract said to have
been entered into between the four
men on July 9, 1915. The defendants
in the litigation are Sherman, Wil
liam Isom, his son Edward, Joseph A.
Cudahy and the Cudahy Refining com
pany, recently absorbed by the Sin
clair Oil & Refining company, another
defendant. They were named in a bill
filed by Crawford and Norris in the
circuit court here three weeks ago.
Since then Sherman has filed a
cross bill to this action in which he
seeks to repudiate the contract with
Stokes, Crawford and N'orris, alleging
that he was ignorant of the terms of
the contract. In reply to these claims
W. L. Fisher, representing Stokes, has
filed an answer to the cross bill mak
ing a blanket denial of Sherman's
claims.
In the complaint filed against Sher
man and the others by Crawford and
Norris it is charged that Sherman
"fraudulently delayed" completion of
a still in Indiana for demonstration
of his process, accepting over a long
period financial aid in the work and
crude oil for carrying it on.

VILLA'S MEN AND
CARRANZISTAS IN
A SAVAGE BATTLE
Main Body of Rebel Force BriTOn Off
After Attack on Be Facto Gar
rison at ParraL
Chihuahua, July 11. The main
body of the Villa force retreating from
Jiminez attacked Parral, 50 miles to
the southwest, but was defeated by
the Carranza garrison after a savage
battle, according to an official report
received by General Jacinto Trevino.
The report, sent in by General Er
nesto Garcia, commander at Parral,
says thai the bandits, suffering heavy
losses, retreated to Sombreretillo, a
few miles southeast of Parral. It adds
if they make a stand there, the decid
ing battle of the Villista campaign
should be fought late today or tomor
row, as the de facto government's cav
alry, under Generals Domingo Arrieta
and Matias Ramos, Is almost within
striking distance of this place.
General Garcia gives no details of
the fighting, which he describes as
very savage, promising to send a full
description later. He says it was evi
dently the Villa intention to drive off
the Parral garrison so that the town
could be looted and perhaps more
ammunition obtained.

not stated. The Parral garrison has
previously been estimated at about
400 men.
