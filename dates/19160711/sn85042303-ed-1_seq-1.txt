SEVERAL MEN INTERESTED IN
ZINC BUSINESS ARE IN THE
CITY AND WILL INSPECT SEV
ERAL PIECES OF PROPERTY.
Several men who are interested in
the zinc business are in the city today
and will make a personal examination
of the Arbuckle fields and also sonw
zinc deposits on the Will Warren farm
near Berwyn.
Sidney Ford, one of the pioneer
citizens of this section, who has been
interested in minerals for a number
of years, will leave for the Arbuckle
I mountains tomorrow. It begins to
j look as if there would be greater de
velopment in the Arbuckle field. The
I price of zinc has soared to the top
most heights as a result of the war
In Europe, and the demand at pres
ent is greater than the supply. Zinc
enters largely into the manufacture
of war munitions, and all the mines
of the world have been put to task
to supply the demand.
