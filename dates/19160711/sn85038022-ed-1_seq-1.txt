Craven In the courthouse at 11 o'clock
jestcrday morning, It wai decide" by
the stockholders of the lxlngton
I'aseball Club aud business men pres
i in to have another meeting at 7:30
o'clock Tuesday night, to which the
directors of the Islington Hoard of
Commerce will be Invited. A commit
tee composed of Howard tluyn, Wil
liam K Stngg and David R. Monaker
called on Secretary II. I- Hurch fol
lowing the meeting and Mr. Hurch
promised to notify the directors of
the Tuesday night session
Several plans for raising the money
necesaary to keep the club In Ixlng
ton were discussed yesterday morning
The Board of Comaierce will be asked
to help, and It is thought that they
will do all they can In a financial way
for the club. Committee will proba
bly be appointed tonight to visit every
business man In Lexington and get
subscriptions. About one-third of the
amount needed to finance the club has
already been promised by several pub
lic spirited men, among them being
President Prower. Hogan Yancey, Wil
liam E Stagg, James T. Looney and
David Honaker, who promised $100
apiece.
A tag day has also been suggested,
and it Is planned for the players to
sell the tags on the street for any
amount the purchaser feels able to
pay. Plans for playing a game at
Cynthiana on July 1! were also dis
cussed, and It is a sure bet that the
team would draw a good crowd in that
city, as Rorer and McClellan, two of
the stars of the team, hall from that
city. Billy White, the Colt third-sack-er,
promised to make the trip to that
city and make arrangements for the
game. The Colt players are very anx
ious to stay In this city Instead of KQ
lng to HuntingtoB, as most of them
have been in Lexington long enough
to feel that it is their home.
If the members of the Board of Com
merce can be made to realise that a
baseball club which can put up the
game the Colts have played for the
past two months la a big aaaet to the
city and also one of the best advertise
ments lxxlng1on can poaalbly have,
the club will atay In Islington. The
directors of the league have agreed to
wait until the question Is definitely
decided, and the Colts will probably
play their first game of the new sea
ion Thursday If the neceaaary funds
are raised.

MRS. C. C. DEGMAN
lessrd Away at Her Home Near
Nprlngdal I-ast Evening About
7tSn OVloek Was One of the
Most Prominent Women
In This Section of
the State.
WAXTKO
MM II Ul. I'RISOMK
Mrs. C. C. Degman died at her home
near Springdale last evening at 7: JO
o'clock after a lingering Illness of
about six weeks.
Mrs. Anna M. Doyle Degman was
born In Fleming county September 25,
1848. She was married to C. C. Deg
man February 14th, 1868. and since
that time lived in the old Degman
home near Springdale. Seven children
were born to them, Ave of whom sur
vive, Clarence O. of Cincinnati; Mrs
P. F. Martin of Kdmonton, Canada;
Mrs. O W. Hook of Springdale; Julius
S. of White Salmon, Washington, and
John T. of Kingman, Ariz.
Mrs. Degman was a member of the
Third 8treet M. E. Church of Mays
ville and had been a member of this
church since her marriage. She was
a consistent Christian nnd was very
prominent In church work. She es
tablished the Methodist Sunday School
at Springdale. She was a member of
the Maysvllle W. C. T. II. and of the
Rerea, Ky., Capt. James West W It
She will be remembered as one of
the greatest workers In the Old Set
tlers' Reunions and the O. A. II. meet
ings. She was secretary of the six
teenth and Tenth Kentucky Regimen
tal Associations.
The Ledger loses one of its best
friends by the death of Mrs. Degman
For over forty years she has written
for the Dally Republican and the Daily
Public Ledger. Her husband was one
of the founders of the first Republican
newspaper in this county and she al
ways showed a great interest In its
welfare.
Mrs. Degman had been a patient suf
ferer lor about six weeks but fre
quently expressed her complete resig
nation to God's will. "The peace
which passeth all undertaking" im
pressed everyone coming in her pres
ence.
Her work In Qod's service, with her
pen, words and actions have been in
calculable, so, In direct opposition to
the pessimistic Immortal Bard we con
(ldently aver that that "the good this
woman has done will live after her"
and the good will not be "Interred
with her bones."
The funeral will be held tomorrow
morning from the llethauy Church
The funeral services will be conduct
ed by Rev. J. M. Literal of the Third
Street M. E. Church. The burial will
be made in the Bethany cemetery by
the side of her husband.

Iu Police Court yesterday the fol
lowing cases were disposed of:
Lee Spencer, drunk, $6.50.
W. S, Taylor, driving an automobile
without displaying license tag thereon
$13.90.
Tom Dempsoy, drunk, $6.60.
Laura Oray, breach of the peace,
$6.60.
This is one of the largest days the
court has had for some time and
reflects much on the police force as
their efficiency makes the wrongdoer
think twice before he does anything
against the law.
