WANTED TO SEE MICE
But Had to Come Homt
When the Order Was
Issued.
,? Johnnie came marching home today.
1 Not literally, of course, lor he and 200
odd companions camo In stuffy Balti
more and Ohio coaches, but in spite
uninspiring surrounding: or his
home coming he was received with
;; 3U?t as hearty a welcome aa if ho had
trudged many weary miles from
bloody fields.
' ^gt was not Johnny's fault that his
prow was not graced by garlands oi
B?W*el. It was with firm purpose born
| of the noblest possible patriotism that
VsS&S* but a short whiie ago and the
heartaches and the tears of those ho
jpo?t; behind were Just as genuine as
were the high aspirations in Johnnie's
Snund. So far as Johnnie and those
Who love him are concerned the leav
ing was the real thing, and for augm
J those who saw tlfe train steam out
Jgjgow some of the bravo boys who woro
I ao3|board would never sco the bcauti
^folvhllls surrounding Fairmont again.
And that fact establishes Johnnie's
;?Utus. He is just as much of a hero
?? the fellows who have come to grips
with the enemy on the battle fronts
Jfef^Snrope. It was with pride as well
JBflye. therefore, that Johnnie was
fejocmed when he arrived here. Thore
~T have been a tinge of regret in his
that he -did not get a chance
at the real thing, but that will wear
off before long and when he gets time
o remember that he is a better soldier
sand, citizen as a result of his trip to
| Camp Kanawha he probably will re
Mgwd^it as one of the happy episodes
jpfpiis life even though he does feel
| that Adjutant General Bond owes the
i regiment and the pecple of the
| state a large and long explanation re
\ gtfrding the call for tho regiment and
Ahe air of mystery which was thrown
ibout the whole movement by the au
thorities at Charleston.
The men got in at 1:15 o'clock. Lo
jcw offiicals of the railroad did a lot
j ot guessing during the morning as to
? the provable hour of their arrival.
Not once, however, did they guess the
right time. The arrival would have
been a tame affair, therefore, but for
the fact that the station was filled at
the time with people who wore wait
ing for outgoing trains. As it was
jlew of the people who had planned to
r he jon hand to cheer were there. Once
off the train the boys did not stop to
I fall In but walked in bunches to the
T&ory wlwre they exiStanged Bieir

made at the armory the men will be

General Situation Along the
Somme Front is Un
changed.
(By Associated Press)
PARIS. July 11.?The situation re
mained unchangod on the Sornmo
front last night The war office state
ment of today says it has been ascer
tained that, south of the Somme the
French in the last two days have tak
! en more than 1300 prisoners.
I On the Verdun front the Germans
launched an attack at 4 o'clock tliis
' morning, on the French position from
Fleury to a point, east of Chenois.
They succeeded .in penetrating ad
vanced French trenches at some
! points but were expelled immediately
| by counter attack. West of the Mouse
there was active artillery fighting in
the neighborhood of Avocourt and
Chattancourt.
The French continue to report satis
factory progress in their great offen
sive in Pricardy. Monday's opera
tions again were confined to the south
ern echelon which has consolidated
and extended its hold upon the north
ern plateau opposite Peronno.
The outstanding French success of
the day was the capture of all the
Gorman positions on Hill 97, the high
est point of the plateau. The first
French rush on Saturday carried them
to the western slope of this hill on
which they made good their looting
but their troops waiting there had
been stopped until adequate prepara
tions permitted an attack on the farm
buildings at the summit, it being
made with more speed and fewer cas
ualities. They are now in full pos
session of this height from which they
look into Peronne 150 feet below. The
results they claimed from the whole
day's fighting is command of the left
bank of the Somme from east of Feuil
leres to a point opposite Flaucourt. tne
Garmans holding only a few positions
on the edge of the river. This does
not mean, French military critics ad
mit, that Peronne can be captured out
of hand. The* Garmans, according to 1
the sttaements of prisoners have con
structed formidable defenses, outside
the city but the French believe that
these are not likely to delay the cap- {
ture when General'Foch decided the

British have been able to make prog

HOT ENOUGH BUT
HAS SEEK HOTTER
'Once Went up to 107 Degrees
Right in This
y Town.
'How do you like the hot weather?"
This insulting and annoying question
has been frequently asked during the
past three days by thoughtless persons
who seem to take delight in irritating
those of Fairmont's citizens who are
vainly endeavoring to keep cool, and
who are almost afraid even to speak
o! the heat.
Already today last years July hot
day record has been beaten for tem
perature and several thermometers
aobut the city are registering 101 de
grees this atfernoon. The maximum
for last July was 97 and occurred on
July 19. The maximum yesterday was
93 and perhaps the breeze that has
cooled Fairmont all day is the only
reason that no-heat prostrations have
yet been reported.'
Lodarweather'prophets predict that
the record for the past twenty-five
years will bo broken unless rain falls
this week. The highest July temper
ature ever recorded in this section
was in 1895 when thcmercury reached
107 in July.
During the hot days a very notic|f
able 'decrease in the speed of trafTic
on the streots has been noticed and
most. of_ the .people _of..the city are
keeping In-the shade to escape the
blistering noonday sun.
