General Scott during their confe-r-enct-s

out by officers commanding troops
on opposite aide of the International

the American troops at Presidio,
talked with Colonel Rojas, command
ant of the Mexican garrison at OJin

No Instruction,
No instructions from depart mental

der commanders to enter into nego
tiations with the Mexican officers, hut
it was indicated at (ieneral Funafuti's
headquarters that similar efforts
would lie made by all American of
ficers whoso commands face Mex
ican troops. It was indicated that in
all cases the American officers wouhN
be expected to listen to any plan of
co-operation proposed and In cases
where practicable to work In the clos
est harmony with tlio Mexican com
manders. It was regarded here as possible
that the infurmal conferences, that
It s expected will In held all alone

rffectinir the Joint action proposed by
the Mexican minister of war. Colonel
(Jnnton, commanding ttie American
troops In the Rig Herd district,
watc hed for slims that Villa's men or
other bandits were moving against the

PERMANENT PEACE
IS WILSON'S THEME
Tells Detroit Audience This
Must Come Through
Understanding.
DETROIT. July 10. President Wil
son urged peace reached by
mutuul understanding rather than
force in speeches today to enthusiastic
Michigan audiences. Detroit streets
were lined with thousands of persons
who shouted greetings and waved
American flaps at him wherever he
appeared, the hall In wlilch he spake
to the World's Salesmanship congress,
was Jammed, a biff audience greeted
hln at the Ford motor plant and to
night In Toledo another throng list
ened to his brief rear-platform ad
dress. "Peace," was the shouted response
of the salesmanship audience when
the president asked them what they
desired when the present world strug
gles are at an end. And he added
that "permanent peace'' was Ids de
sire. Defend DcnuMTats.
At a nonpartisan luncheon In the
Detroit Athletic club the president
sprang to the defense of the Demo
crats. A prominent Republican had
told him during the day that he had
been deriving pleasure frtim associa
tion with Democrats and the execu
tive recited the incident and declared
he long had enjoyed the frindship and
companionship of Republicans be

them something"

NKW YORK. July 10. Kx-Justirc
Hughes has refused to let W'il
liirrc Rarnes rnd other members of
the "old guard" dictate th" plans for
his campaign. This became known
yesterday, when the organisation of a
National Hughes Alliance went on un
interrupted, as did the work of se
lecting well known Progn ssives for
places on the Hughes campaign com
mittee. The "old guard" has endeavored to
persuade Mr. Hughes that his cam
paign should he an out-and-out Re
publican affair, with no thought of
the Piogressiveg or other Independ
ents be recognized.
Within the last few days emissaries
of Raines and other members of the
"old guard'' have called on Chairman
Willcox and assorted that the en
rolled voters of the Republican party
represented sufficient strength to
elect Mr. Hughes without any outside
help. Some of them even wanted
Colonel Roosevelt kept , from the
stum p.
Intentions Worry V',,n,,,
These Ideas, It Is known, are pre
cisely those held bv Rarnes. More
than once he has told his friends that
he believed if Colonel Roosevelt took
the stump for Mr. Hughes he would
hurt the ticket. The opposition of
the "old guard" to the organization of
f HugHes alliance shows that other
veteran politicians are somewhat wor
ried over Mr. Huehes' Intentions.
The object of the Hughes alliance
is to join the various Independent
organizations that will be formed to
help elect Mr. Hughes under a na
tional organization. Tt will work in
conjunction with the Republican cam
paign committee.
The "old guardsmen." however,
give It as their belief that Us organ
izers intend to have the alliance,
eventually supplant the regular Re
publican organization. In other
words, the old time bosses think that
the former justice intends to build up
an organization of hij own and they
are worried about it.
It is understood that Mr. Hughe
believes that the help of the Irogres
slves and other independents Is as es
sential to his success as the support or
the Republican organization and ho
Is going to have it, if possible.
Democrats After Moose Vote.
Coincident with the reports of "old
guard" dissatisfaction, news reached,
here from some of the middle western
states that the Democrats were work
ing overtime to capture the Progres
sive vote. Almost every Inducement
possible has been offered to foremost
Progressives to line up with Wilson,
the Democrats even promising patron
age. Vance McCormlck. chairman of the
Democratic national committee, hopes
to re-elect President Wilson with the
aid of the Progressives and he is leav
ing nothing undone to do so. It is
expected that the Progressives will
receive representation on the Wilson
campaign committee and there Is an
organization known as the Woodrow
Wilson Independent league in which
they can enroll. Mr. McCormick went
to Washington last night to discuss
further the personnel of the commit
tee with the president, J

from Ronton, Chicago, Raltimorc, To

and towns.
Washington Sends Aid.
In Washington steps were taken to
organize a federal corps of surgeonB
and laboratory scientists who will
work on preventive measures against
the spread of the disease. Telegrams
were sent to all public health stations
and officers throughout the country
and to state health authorities ask
ing them to make a thorough investi
gation anl report the presence of any
case of infantile paralysis In their dis
tricts. I.atc in the afternoon Assistant f,ur-geon-Genenil
W. C. Rucker of the
Cnlted Statea public hr..!h service
loft Washington at the head of five
skilled discus Investigators for New

ever-Increasing danger of a nation
wide epidemic.
Congress Saturday passed n reso
lution instructing rhe nuthtrities at
Kills Island to turn their hospital over
to the city of New York for the care
of Infantile .jiralys's victims.
The resolution wns put through the
senate without dbnte and promptly

The remarkable speed with which
congress acted indicated that in case
of further assistance Is needed It will

the senate were unanimous In their
expressions that the federal govern

The Red Cress today took steps to

ap eal for nurses to come to assist
the nurses theie In their fight on the
scourge. Miss Jane A. Delano, head
of the nurse's department of the Red
Cicss. will leave today to assume
charge of the nursing situation. Ac
cording to reports received fiom
there today, tl e hospitals are over
loaded with patients, and both hoc
tors and nurses are becoming worn
out wdth their steady work.
Although Dr. W. C. Rucker, chief
of the quarantine division ot the psl
llc health service, was here today
conferring with the city,, and state
health officials, the public health of
ficials here kept in touch with the
situation all day long.
Isolation Is Favored.
II Is still the belief of the public
health officials that the liest way to
chock the epidemic Is to Isolate both
the patients and the contacts.
Through that process, they Insist, the
disease ultimately must give way he
fore the fight on It. They continued
to resent all suggestions that New
York should be quarantined, and they
Indicated a possible Intention to take
up with varl .his states the matter of
raising quarantines already put on
persons from New York.
The department of agriculture took
a hand in the light today when It is
sued an order releasing tho i-hlpinent
of monkeys In Manila which were

In New York for experimental work.
The monkevs will be used to study

In his trial for the alleged murder of
Marion Ijimliert, had 'hem served up

The defendant w hen a wiine-ss ad

attempted to conceal the fact eif his
trip to Iake l-'eirest by rumpling his
hod so that his I'inolai.'y would think l
that he slept in it.
Attorney Kunene M. Runyard of the

bed and the alibi le-tteis as damaging
evidences of guilt.
The absence of motive for minder

of repeateel attacks by the lawyer.
"You must bear in mind, gentlemen
of the Jury, that what would not pro
vlele a motile mr ye-u -u for nie mUht

callous youth wlo without a quaint

exposure to orpet nnd that entaili-J

large an obstacle to his Jistoned vi
