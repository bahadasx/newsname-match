TWO WILLS FILED MONDAY
Last Testaments of Mrs. Kirby and
Miss Helm Go To Probate.
With the exception of the wills of
Mrs. Mattie VanDeveer Kirby and
Miss Kate Helm being probated
there was very little done in county
court Monday.
Mrs. Kirby's will bears date of
June 20, 1916, and is witnessed by
Dr. J. F. Peyton and Miss Blanche
VanDeveer. She requests that all
debts and her funeral expenses be
paid. That her interest in the Van
Dever place of 45 acres be held in
trust for Mrs. Sallie Varnon, her
sister, and that K. S. Alcorn act as
trustee. That in the event of the
death of Mrs. Varnon, the trust as
to said property continue for the
benefit of her niece, Mis,s Martha L.
Varnon, until she becomes 30 years
of age and then it is to be given to
her in fee simple. If Mrs. Varnon
is alive when Miss Varnon reaches
the age of 30, the latter will then
take the property. If Mr. Alcorn
should decline to serve as
Mrs. Kirby asks that the
trustee,
Lincoln
Trust Co., do so.
To her uncle, Mr. M. O. VanDe-
veer, Mrs. Kirby left a set of walnut j
furniture, to Miss M. A. Thomas, of
Louisville, a very dear friend, some
jewelry and $50, to her cousin, Mrs.
W. K. Shugars, a cameo pin, to Mrs.
Julia Hughes, as a token of friend
ship, a silver water set; to her
niece, Miss Martha Varnon, some
jewelry and to Thomas W. Varnon,
her nephew, and Miss Alice M. Jones
some tokens of love are devised. The
request is made that a small granite
marker be placed at her grave in
Buffalo Cemetery. Mr. Alcorn had
not qualified -as trustee nor has Mr.
VanDeveer as executor, but they will
probably do so later.
Miss Helm's will bears date of
Aug. 16, 1915. She requests that
her debts and funeral exnenses he
paid and leaves all of her property,
personal, real and mixed to her niece
Miss Susan R. Helm, daughter of

10, 1916, Miss Helm added a codicil
in which she divides her 'property
equally between her brother, Squire
Helm, and her niece. She asks that
J. K. Helm, Jr., serve as trustee or
agent to administer the child's part.

Squire Helm was appointed adminis
trator, with will annexed. The wit

CHILD HAS CLOSE
CALL UNDER AUTO
Little E. T. Pence, III, Run Over by
Andy Gooch, But Is Unhurt
Fatality in Lexington.
E. T. Pence, III, the three-year-old
son of Adam Pence, had a narrow es
cape from being crushed to death by
an automobile, when the little fellow
was struck and run over by Andy
Gooch's new Ford car late Monday
afternoon. The child had gotten out
of sight of Mrs. Pence in some way
and ran out into the road in front
of their home on the Somerset pike.
Mr. Gooch came by in his car soon
afterward, and the child started
across the pike in front of the car.
Mr. Gooch slowed up, but instead of
continuing across the road, the lit
tle fellow hesitated when in front
of the car and turning started back
the way it had came. It did this so
quick that Mr. Gooch was unable to
avoid striking it. The little boy was
knocked down, but very luckily the
car passed completely over it, with
out, a wheel touching it. Outside of
a few minor bruises, the little fel
low was uninjured. His escape was
almost miraculous. Mr. Gooch
stopped his car as quickly as possi
ble, and ran back and was delighted
to find the baby unhurt. He was in
no way to blame for the aeeideat
and certainly was relieved t find it
not serious.
