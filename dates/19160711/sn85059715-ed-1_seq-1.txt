PARIS, July 11.?Tho situation
remains unchanged on the Romme
front. The war office statement of
Tuesday says It has been ascertained
that south of tho Somme the French
In the last two days have taken more
than 1,300 prisoners.
On the Verdun front the Germans
launched an attach at 4 o'clock Tuesday
morning on the French positions
from Fleury to n point cast of Che
nois. They succeeded In penetrating
advanced French trenches at some
points but were expelled Immediately
by a counter attack.
West of the Mouse there was active
artillery fighting In the.ncighborhood
of Avocourt and Chattancourt.
The French continue to report satisfactory
progress In their great offensive
In I'lcardy. Monday's operations
again were confined to the
southern echelon, which has consolidated
and extended its hold upon the
northern plateau opposite Peronnc.
Hill 07 is Taken.
The outstanding French success of
the day was the capture of all the
German positions on hill 07, the
highest point of the plateau. The
first French rush on Saturday carried
the into the western slopes of
this hill on which they made
good their footing but their
troops waiting there had been
stopped until adequate preparations
permitted an attack on the farm
buildings at the summit which the
Germans had converted Into a small
farm residence it being made with
more sneed and fewer casualties.
They are now In full possession of
