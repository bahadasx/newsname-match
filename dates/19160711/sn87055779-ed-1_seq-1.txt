Julv 10. ( via London. July 11.) It
was a mid-summer afternoon with
lleecy clouds, bright sunlight and
lear air. which was all .my artillery
observer could ask. when the Prit-
i.-di stormed Constalmaison on the
Somme river front, whoso possession
both sides t-eemed to regard as a
lactional keystone in the present
situation. Fragments of walls of
the old Chateaux still standing
amidst the ruins was the last
vlimpse the correspondent had in
their prefatory hnmhardment beforo
the attack. Fifteen-inch shells
from the Hritish guns soon tore
away t'his portion of the ruins from
which ros a cloud of dust. For a
giv n area the artillery, tire wvs the
heaviest of any vet seen on this
front .
The Hermans answered the Brit
ish shelling with an immense vol
ume of the ir own tire, placing a cur
tain in front of the town which, at
times hit the (loud from the
British guns nvelopint: the town
and also scattering shells near the
front line.
I "ir e Keeps on Inci cainz.
The British tire kept on in reas-irv-r
and spreading and the demian.s
in answer extended their shelling
until the line stretched from Trones
wood, another hotly disputed point
which had already become a stretch
of branchless. "eafless trunks, to
' rv lib rs and Ia Boisdie. Along
this new front the artillery duel
I c ontinued to rage.
At 4 : 4 1 o'clock when the British
barged, there seemed to be peace
in Contalmaison. Put it was soon
i surrounded by walls of shell tire.
After the Brtish got in and the
dermans were forced out. dertnan
guns took their turn at hammering
the ruins and knot king off more
sections of the walls of the old

and. as a spectacle this afternoon
eclipsed anything the correspondent
has seen since the allied offensive
began. From one point, lie was able
to see from the region of Albert to
the bend of th Somme. in front of
Peroune. The present line of battle
is mapped across fDlds. woods, val
leys and hills by shell bursts.
Nineteen great allied "sausage,
balloons" were visible and the ab
sence of them on the dermun side,
as the result of their destruction by
British shells and aeroplanes, is
held by artillery observers to be a
bi handicap to the dermans.
Over the French lines. speedy
Xieuport aeroplanes. dashing pasl
halloons. were going and coming at
the rate of 1J0 miles an hour, and
as one British officer said. "These
little machines, with their smart
huild and tail held high, express tho
feelings of the French."

Pasing through the French lines
the correspondent noted that tho
French had something of the gayety
associated with their national tem
perament instead of the grimness to
be associated with them in this war.
The sharp competition between
two famous French army corps as
they pressed forward to take fle
nches, which puts the French mi the
Somme with a gain of six miles, has
set every Frenchman's eye flashing.
F.very village taken had been
razed by shell fire, hut there was
no complaint, only rejoicing when
the village was captured.
The Germans have concentrated
heavily between the Anere ami the
Somme. where there is no river be
tween them and the allies, and they
are evidently determined to contest
the forces that endanger their main
second line step by step.

International News Service:
WASHINGTON, July 11. Serious
concern is growing in administration
circles over the new certain assaults
to he made upon American trade
supremacy when the Furopean war
ends. Much of the alarm is due to
the study of the reports made hy
the American embassy in Paris in
recent conference of the representa
tives of the entente powers.
The fact that they adopted a pro
gram of offense and defense along
trade lines indicates, otlicials say,
that after the war they will try to
extend their bo.vcott to neutral na
tions in order that their own trade
may recover from the effects of the
Kreat contlict.
Teutons Also Iunors.
It will not alone be the entente
powers that must be reckoned with.
Naturally, olficials say, the Teutonic
powers do not intend to quietly sub
mit to any general boycott. As a
result the economic pressure will he
extreme and the United States must
be in a position to compete with
reduced prices and cut rates along
all lines of production. Fortunate
ly, otlicials say, this country's finan
cial reserve will he so vast that it
will have a material advantage at
all times.
Sens. Stone and L,odge agreed, rn
their speeches in the jenate yester
day, that the situation is one that
demands the greatest care in shap
ing a future policy. It has been de
cided by the senate committee on
foreign relations that it will care
felly examine all of the data sub
mitted by the state departmenv
through the president jesterday and
try to decide on non-partisan rem
edial legislation.
Three I n estimations.
This will make three separate in
vestigations along this line in prog
ress as follows:
By Sec'y of Commerce Kedfield
and the division of domestic and
foreign commerce.
By the federal trade commission.
By the senate foreign relations
committee.
Fp to the present no data is avail
able a." to the effect the proposed
commercial agreement among the
entente allies will have upon the
trade of neutral nations. This Is
the information that the senate
committee is most anxious to get,
and it is understood that the presi
dent will be asked to have it gath
