Baltimore, Md., July 10.—The dar­
ing German seamen who brought the
submarine merchantman, DeutsiW
land, across the Atlantic slept quietly
tonight aboard their vessel, which lay
moored to a carefully screened pier,
guarded by a strong guard of Balti­
more police. Captain Paul Koenig,
the skipper, had delivered his papers
to the North German-Lloyd office, en­
tered his vessel at the customs house
as a common carrier, and presented
to the German embassy a package of
correspondence for Count von Bern
8torff.
Million Dollar Cargo.
Now the submarine is ready to dis­
charge her million dollar cargo of
dyestuff and take on board the metal
and rubber needed by the emperor's
army and navy. The boat is lying in
h6r dock and her departure will de­
pend largely on eluding vigilant en­
emy cruisers, expected to be waiting
outside the entrance of Chesapeake
bay for the appearance oT that ves­

One of Captain Koenig's acts, aft£r
he' moved his ship up the harbor from
Quarantine tonight was, to announce
tltft the Deutschland was one of a
fliefet of many submersibles built or
bWMlng' 'for a regular transatlantic
fffcftfht'and mail service. He said the
next to -come would be the Bremen,
and'that she might, be looked for with
ing eight weeks.
It was stated on the authority of
the captain that the only arms on
the boat were four automatic pistols
belonging to. the officers and a sports­
man's rifle for firing rockets.
No iFear of Enemies.
Captain Koenig had no fears of h.'s
ability to elude enemies that might
be waiting for him off the Virginia
capes when he starts his return trip.
"I will be able to submerge within
the three-mile limit, and they cannot
catch me after that."
Duripg nearly the entire trip to Am
ferftlafsaid Capta'fn 'Koenig, the
I&$g6hraiij)' traveled on the surface.
Once she'subiiaerged for ten hours,
and lail on the bottom of the English
Channel to1 escape' British destroyers,

of Bremen'on June! 14. He went di­
rectly to Heligoland, remaining there
"nine days. On June 23, the subma­
rine1slipped away from the island for­
tress and the trip, which ended in
Efcltlmore today, began. After com­
pleting the formalities with the au­
thorities Captain, Kpenlg was invited
to dine as the guest of honor with
the German club, and there von
Hailmhausen, consul of the German
embassy, received the paskage of of­
ficial correspondence destined to
Count von Bernstorff. T*ae consul had
Journeyed -here from New York and
was the guest with the captain of the
Deutschland at luncheon.
'T have come here," said the rep­
resentative of the embassy, "to pre­
sent the personal. compliments of
Count von Bernstorff to Captain Koe­
nig and to congratulate him r.n his
wonderful achievement. The ambas­
sador had no official interest in the
Deutschland. The captain declared,
"Count von Bernstorff has turned over
some correspondence, which I am
taking back with me, hut I have no
knowledge of Its contents."
Submarine Inventor Arrives.
Simon Lake, submarine inventor,
came here today from Bridgeport,
Conn., and saw Captain Koenig. He
refused to discuss the report that he
proposed to bring litigation against
the Deutschland and her owners for
alleged infringement of the inventions
of the Lake Boat company. He de­
clared that the chief purpose of his
visit was to congratulate the Deutsch
land's commander for his exploits.

Detroit, July 10.—President Wilson
urged peace reached by mutual un­

defended the democratic party as a
friend of business, in speeches today
to enthusiastic Michigan audiences.
Detroit's streets were lined with
thousands of persons, who shouted

"Peace," was the shouted response
of the salesmanship audience, when
the president asked them what they

A prominent republican had told
him during the day that he had been

(though h«j is hailed throughout

There is a strange absence of de­

"I have absolutely 110 idea as to
when we will leave," said Col. John
H. Fraine when interviewed by a re­
presentative of The Tribune last eve­

direct, ordeis. Our equipment is tip
to standard, every officer and man in
the caulp 1s in the best physical con­
dition and the only thing that is hold
ing us here is a wire from headquar­

"Have you any reason to think the
troops will be called out tomorrow,"
was asked the colonel by the inquisi­
tive correspondent.
"It is impossible for me to answer
that question," replied the command­
er of the North Dakota regiment.
"Orders cannot be hurried in this
case, and although I had expected
that we would be well on our journey
by this time my hands are tied and
I can do nothing but await develop­

"Will the troops move in one body
or be entrained and taken in three
separate groups," was the next ques­

"I am of the opinion that three spe­
cial trains will take the North Dako­
ta regiment to the border," answered
the commander. "I expect that the
three battalions will leave separately,
however they will follow one another
closely."
"Will the orders to entrain come
directly from the war department or
from some other source?"
"That is hard to say," said the col­
onel hesitatingly. "Orders may come
directly from Secretary Baker or pos­
sibly from some sub-bordinate branch
of the department."

North Dakota Regiment
Remains at Fort Lincoln
And Awaits Orders to Move
All of the officers and men are in
the best of health but many are be­
coming impatient over the delay.
There is not a man in the regiment
but what is ready and anxious to get
to Mexico and all are heart and soul
in the interest of their country.
Major Peterson of the hospital
co^ps stated last evening that not a
man has reported to the sick ward
with any ailment with the exception
of effects from the injection of the
anti-toxin. Members of the hospital
corps have had an easy time of it
since reporting for duty but are be­
ginning to find the task of "watchful
waiting" an irksome one. They are
not anxious that anyone be taken ill
but would like a change of atmos­
phere and believe the Mexican cli­
mate is just what they are in need of.
Men from the various companis are
praising their cooks highly and state
that they are getting grub that is of
high class variety. Pork chops,
bread and butter, spuds, cookies, cof­
fee, and prunes for desert was a re­
cent menu at one of the company
camps and to say the least it sounds
very apetizing. A small ice cream
freezer was produced from some un­
known source last evening and sev­
eral of the officers and men took
turns turning the handle and prepar­
ed a relishable article for the hot
weather experienced of late.
No Damage From Storm.
The wind and rain storm experienc­
ed in this vicinity Sunday evening did
little or no damage at Fort Lincoln.
Tents were fastened down securely
