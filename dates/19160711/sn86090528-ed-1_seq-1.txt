Berlin Believes Peace Negotiations Will
Follow Flare-Up ot Present Efforts
of Allied Armies Within
Next Few Weeks
By C. W. Ackerman,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Berlin, July li That the great al
lied offensive win end in a few weeks
and will be roiiowed by peace nego
tiations is the opinion which is being
expressed by well informed persons in
Berlin.
Kxeept in one narrow sector the
British, have been unable to make a
perceptible impression on the German
lines, despite their overwhelming su
periority iu numbers.
The French have made some pro
gress south of the Somuie river but
thus far neither of the allied armies
have developed the powerful attack
which will be necessary to completely
break the deadlock in the west.
The feeling prevails that when the
extent of the British losses are known
in Fngiand public opinion will de
mand peace without further slaughter.

37,000,000 Armenians Perish ly Hand

Terrific Slaughter of Chris-.
tians Continues
HORRIBLE TORTURE OF
HELPLESS VICTIMS
Five Women Crucified and Blood of One
Thrown Into River on Cross Reaches
Christian Battleships at
Mouth ol Rivei
(Written for the United Press.)
"Revolutionary movement and open
treason" have been the cause ot tho
present plight of the Armenians In
Asia Minor, according to Dr. Ahmed
Kmtn, f litor of the Constantinople
Tanin, as set forth in his story, "The
Other Side," recently printed lu thi
press of the United States.
When the Turks conquered Ar
menia 50 years ago there were 40,.
t00,000 Armeulana in that country.
Today there are hardly 3,000.000 X
them all over the world.
The :;7,ooo,000 Armenians perished
as the result of periodic, annual and
dally manacres at the hands of "the
Turks. A fanatic may consider thi;
the work of a "human race" the
Turks-and Indulge in pointing out
the faults of other nations to justify,
the barbaric acta of its own.
Tongues Cut Out.
The assimilation of the Armenians'
is a hi: toric impossibility, Even the
Turkish practice of cutting the tongua
of every Armenian when h fulled to
speak )u Turkish did not ; make suc
cessful the assimilation policy of th
Ottoman government.
By wh:-t sense of justice then does
the Turk argue In favor. ot his own
government as a giver of freedom
of laiuuage? What does the gentle
man .mean bv "freedom of language?
What doeii tne gftutlemun mean by
"freedom ot community" if he does
not vlsh to coutradict flatly the fiats
of the Ottoman rulers? ,
Thirty thousand Armenians -werei
mastacred In Aduna at the bauds ot
(he so called Young-Turkish party in
1908 -soon after the proclamation ot
the "constitutional government.''
Women Are Crucified.
Five women were crucified. One of
tho bodies, still on tho cross, wa3
thrown into tho river and tho blood
stained waves of the river washed
It to where the Christian battleahiiV
were anchored, .
To the mind of our critic this raay
be "absolute equality with tho Turkd.".
Poison for Vaccine-,
Not long ago the government sent
official doctors to "vaccinate" the Ar
menian children of the (own of Zef
tuu. Instead of Injecting tho vaccina'
cyrum they injected poison and 4 DO
'children died in one night. If this is
