Chicago, July 10.-Theodore Roosevelt

the peace and Integrity of the United
States." and the epithet "Byzantine
logothete" was hurled back Int his
teeth in the course of a verbal blast at
the 'national council of the Teutonic Sons

The attack took the form of a letter
addressed to the Colonel, through G. F.
Hummel, national president of the or
ganization.
The epistle set forth that at Its meet
leg the national council had resolved:
that Col. Roosevelt's reported outbursts
against what he calls "professional Ger

cerity and fraud." The letter continues:
"Your voice brazenly raised agai t

"But, thank God. we have the situation

With all the might of gigantic naval

Already, the British admiralty is form

Have Worked i. Channel.
Five hundred of these motor boats
have done excellent work in the British
channel, it is said. They came originally
from the United States. unarmed. and
have been mounted With three-inch guns
and their crews put through special
training to detect and run down under
sea craft. There Is likelihood that they
may be seen i operation against sub
marinea near the three-mile limit line if
the undersea trade route between Bremen
and American ports continues, Opinion
here is that the'e small craft will be
likely se prove more effective "submarine
catchers" than powerful, but bulky
cruisers.
Secrecy is maintained as to just what
measuris Great Britain is taking to
nstablish a cordon of vessels off the coast.
The German officers are aware of these
plans but will rely on the invisibility
if the Deutschland to evade them. Naval
officers here do not, however, share the
opinion advanced by these offlcers that it
will be a very simple matter to escape.
rhey are skeptical about the ability of
Lbe Deutschland to remain four days
nder water.
Must Avoid Ripple.
The necessity of running deeply sub
nerged is to rlminate the ripple of the
>eriscope. With weather and sea condis
ions favorabig. the submarine can prob
ibly proceed at reduced speed forty or
Ifty feet under water without leaving a
race on the surface. But with a calm
Pea and enemy ciaft on the lookout the

nited States navy the latest submarinex
an submerge 20 feet and safely stana

uany indicate that the German aubma
ines do not submerge more than 100 feet.
The announced intention of the oliceria
if the Deutschland to make good their
scape from Baltimore is to submerge
while within the three-mile limit and re
Lppear after a rainety-mile submergeu
un at some point where there will be
so British warcraft.
Periscope Would Show.
Before coming to the surface the pert
cope will presumably show whether the
ica is clear of hostile ships, it is said.
md the Deutschland will therefore not
e exposed to risk.
If the Deutschland is obliged to lose
.00 much distance in escaping, she may,
ace the dangers of a shortage of fuel.'
And this, it is explained, would make,
:apture certain.
The question of whether British war
ships can, under international law, fire
it the Deutschland without warning Is
still discussed by officials here. As a
merchant ship, the Deutschland is en
titled presumably to the same privileges
