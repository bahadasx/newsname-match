Why, Mr. Tanner?
Why cannot the state pay half of
Charles A. Reynolds' expenses to
Washington, D. C., that he may per
form a service to the people free?
Why, Mr. Attorney General?
Frequently the commission hires
special counsel at fancy prices to do
odd jobs.
Very often the commission pays
even more handsome figures to spe
cial engineers and appraisers.
But here is a man who would do the
state a service and charge nothing for
it. All he asks is his railroad fare.
Oregon is anxious to pay his fare
one way.
Yet you turn down his offer.
You toy the "state cannot pay" his

NEW YORK, JULY 11.—IS THE BIGGEST
CITY IN THE WORLD TO BE COMPLETELY CUT
OFF FROM THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE?
Absolute quarantine of New York has actually
been suggested in medical circles.
With babies dying at the rate of one an hour front
infantile paralysis, the most mysterious and most
dreaded malady in the list of child disease, and with
new cases springing up so rapidly they can't even be re
corded, much less given full attention, New York b
facing one of the most serious problems in the history
of the great city.
It is said absolute quarantine of the city may be
the only means of preventing a spread of the epidemiti
to other communities!
The total number of cases re
ported is now 1.27 R. Of this num
ber 195 now case* were reported
today. This it an Increase of S2
over yesterday's report. Of the
total new cases reported. 155 were
In Brooklyn.
68 New Case*
Only 6* additional babies were
found to be suffering from the die

Altho no state funds are on

Some of the Washington state
health board plans are patterned
after the ()rfpi>n rules which went
Into effect Monday. The lack .if
funds here makes It Impossible to
follow them completely.
Ask Federal Aid
The Or»gon officials have estab
