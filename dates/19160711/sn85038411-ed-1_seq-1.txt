cupy First Line Verdun
Trenches, but Are Ejected
The British lines north of the
Somme are gradually being brought
up to a level with those of the French
further south.
London to-day announced the cap
ture of Contalmaison, marking nota
ble progress in the work of crushing
the German salient extending from
Thiepval on the north and Montauban
on the south.
This process has been further ac
celerated by the taking of several
lines of German trenches in Mametz
wood southwest of Montauban, while
the struggle of the British to regain
possession of Trones wood in the Mon
tauban sector, is continuing.
British Hold Montauban
The entire village of Montauban is
now in possession of the British while
the greater portion of the Mametz
wood is in their hands, the official
statement asserts. Contalmaison was
carried by the British in the initial
rush of their offensive but subse
quently was lost. This time it has
been held against a strong counter at
tack.
500 More Prisoners
Nearly 500 additional prisoners and
four pieces of artillery, including a
heavy howitzer, have been taken by
the British troops.
While the British were achieving
these ersults, the French forces on
their right flank lapsed into momen
tary inactivity after having yesterday
pushed to within a mile of Peronne
and captured a liill commanding the
Somme in_ this region. They have
taken more than 1,300 prisoners in
the last two days.
Continue Verdun Attacks
German attacks at Verdun con
tinue. Paris reports the temporary
success of one of the German charges
in the vicinity of Fumin Wood but
declares the Germans were imme
diately ejected from the advanced
trenches they had captured. Near
Reillon. in Lorraine, German troops
captured portions of French first line
trenches on a 200-meter front.
The Austro-Hungarian admiralty

cruiser Novara of a fleet of four or

Blow Your Horn and
Save the Child
BLOW your horn and save the child," is the text of a letter to the
Telegraph from a subscriber, which strikes such an important note
that it is published herewith. So many children have been' maimed j
or killed during the past few months by automobiles and motor trucks
that some measures of precautions must be taken. The letter in part
follows: '
WIU the Telegraph not add another to lt» many good works for
the City of Harrisburg by starting a "blow your horn, save the
child" crusade? So many little forms have been mangled, so many
little children have t>een killed by motor-driven machines in the
past few months that careful automobile owners for their own
self protection must soon do something to prevent less careful
drivers from "taking a chance" that so often proves fatal, or accept
the consequences. The consequences in this case, no doubt, will be
radical legislation of a regulative character demanded by an in
censed public. The remedy is simple—compel every automobile
driver to "BLOW THE HORN. AND SAVE THE CHILD," or put
him behind the bars, where he belongs.
