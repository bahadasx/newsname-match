Expeot to Fight Recognition
of Liner as Merchantman.
Great Britain and France will
do ererything in their power to
prevent the United States redog
airing the inper submarine
Dentsehland as a ship of com
metre, and to prevent the oper
ation of a line of submarine
freight carriers proposed by the
North German Lloyd Steamship
Company.
This was admitted at the em
bassies of the two governments
today.
BALTIMORE, July 11. With
no restrictions upon them, Cap
tain Hughes, U. S. N., and cus
toms men boarded the German
super-submarine this afternoon to
Inspect her for armament.
This action was taken upon
permission of Manager Hilken, of
the Ocean Transportation Com
pany, after Captain Koenig,
commander, had agreed the men
could learn no secrets of the ves
sel's construction and that they
ought not to be hampered if they
carried Government credentials.
Their -inspection was at the in
stance of the State Department,
which hadhad suggestions from
the allies that it was improper to
treat the ship as a merchantman.
Koenig was in joyful mood to
day and the blue eyes beneath
the heavy brows sparkled and his
tanned face was creased in
smiles.
"I've had a lot of congratu
latory letters," he said, proudly,
"now I've got to go through
them."
UNLOADING CARGO.
Koenig ordered unloading before
coming Into the city to talk with
Hilken. Trusted German employes
were augmented by negro stevedores,
and the bg sacks of dye-tuffs came
out of the hold In Jig time. Guard
w to It that nobody entered the
' pier except employes.
German Ambassador von Bernstorff
Was expected before night.
Incidentally, Hilken confirmed that
the return canto will be nickel and

D. C. COMMISSIONERS FIGHT
ING PARALYSIS
The District Commissioners in a proclamation today deal
ing with preventive measures against infantile paralysis urged:
That tha names of all children under sixteen years of age
who are known to have arrived here from New York within the
past two weeks, bjg immediately reported to the local health office;
That visits from persons residing in New York, especially
children under sixteen years old, be discouraged; and
That the Health Department be notified of any suspiclouB
illness coming under the observation of citizens.
D. C. Adopts Sanitary
Rules in the Fight on
Infantile Paralysis
Commissioners Issue Proclamation, Which Counsels
Against Alarm, But Calling for Co-operation
in Making City Too Clean for Germ
Of Dread Disease.
A state of sanitary siege to kMp nut
the germ of Infantile paralysis exists in
the District of Columbia beginning to
day. A proclamation of the District Com
missioners was issued today calling on
all the people to help the municipal
authorlUes In their efforts to make the
dty so clean that the germs will not
find feeding ground here if they should
happen to alight.
The health department officials want
to put Washington In an absolutely san
itary state.
There are n ocases of Infantile par
alysis In the District at the present
time.
No Cases Here in Two Years.
There have been no cases here for
two years.
At the outset of their proclamation
the District Commissioners lay em
phasis on the fact that there is no cause
for alarm. The proclamation is a "pre
paredness" document they explain
health -preparedness. And If the re
quests that are made for co-operation
are followed the health authorities be
lieve there Is no danger of the dread
disease finding lodgement here. The
text of the proclamation follows:
"Tha Commissioners have noted with
grave Interest and anxiety the wide

submarine Deutschland Is now crossing
the Atlantic and will arrive here within
ten days, the newspaper Rua declared
today.

Arrangements Made To Complete
Cargo At Newport News.
NEWPORT NEWS. Va., July U.
Plans were completed today for bring
ing the Qerman submarine. Deutsch
land, here to complete loading cargo
before returning to Germany.
It Is believed here departure will
be much sooner than officials of the
North German Lloyd line have given
reason to believe that It may be only
a matter of a week, not three weeks,
as hinted.
It Is expected that the big under
water craft will make her departure
from here or some other point near
here, rather than from Baltimore. It
Is thought to be a much easier mat
ter for her to slip out through the
Virginia capes without attracting at
tention If she did not voyage all the
way down the river and Chesapeake
bay just before making the dive out
to sea.
Submarine May Take On
Part of Cargo at Norfolk
BALTIMORE, Md July lL-Manager
Paul H. a. Hilken, of the Ocean Trans
portation Company, owners of the sub
marine Deutschland, admitted today
that "quite probably" the vessel will
take on part of her cargo at Norfolk,
though at what time he would not say.
He denied, however, that the Bremen,
sister-ship of the Deutschland, will
dock at Rio de Jnnerlo. Previously, It
had been stated that she would come
here within the next month, but In any
case, officers here nro likely to refuse tp
announce her destlnatlono in advance,
lest the Information be useful to Ger
many's enemies.
The departure of the Deutsohland will
undoubtedly be within t4aya,
Full details of the cargo carrying
line of submarines have not been an
nounced, though what Information has
leaked out. Indicates that a small fleet
will soon be In operation between the
United States and Germany, and per

British have developed the
powerful attack necessary
to completely break the dead
lock in the west and roll
the Germans out of France
and Flanders.
The feeling prevails here
that when the extent of the
British losses becomes fully
known in England, coupled
with the fact that the Ger
man line still remains in
tact, public opinion will de
mand that peace be made
without further slaughter.
German experts are cer

never quit the attack with

that the British wilt have
