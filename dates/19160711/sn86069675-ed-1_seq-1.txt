WELL KNOWN PRINTER
MEETS DEATH IN ACCIDENT
"Undo" John Caldwell, one of
tho best known journeymen printers
in tho United States, met his death
in Lexington Sunday morning by be
ing run ovor by nn automobile own-cd-'nnd
driven by Mr. Harry Giovnn
noli, editor of the Lexington Lender.
Mr. Giovnnnoli , nccompnnied by
Mr. A. S Bennett, of Louisville, wns
on his way to Boyle county to spend
Sundnywith Mr. GiovannolL's chil
dren. According to Mr- Giovannoli's
statement, Caldwell started to cros
tho street about the middle of the
block. Mr. Giovannoli, who wns
driving at a moderate rate of
speed, watched Caldwell's progress
across tho street, blew his automo
bile horn vigorously, and had no
reason to believe othcrwiso than
that Caldwell would pass on across
the street, thcro being ample time
for him to uu no. Caldwell unfor
tunately appeared to have been
drinking, nnd, when directly in front
of the mnchine, stopped, apparently
in tho act of turning nround. iMr.
Giovnnnoli made every effort to
guide his car around tho man, 'but
it was impossible to do so. Cald
well was struck and fell to the
ground, and tho car passed oVci
his right leg. Mr. Giovnnnoli took
Caldwell in his car-nnd carried him
Tto St. Joseph's hospital, placing
him in chargo of tho physician
there, not believing his injuries were
serious. After the physician told
Mr.' Giovnnnoli that ho could be of
no further service he
proceeded on
his . journey
'UporiWnrriving nt hi?
destination, he called up tho hopital
and then learned of the unfortunate
tjenth of Caldwell, when he immed
iately returned to Lexington. A
strong friendship hud existed be
tween Mr. Giovnnnoli nnd Mr. Cald
well for a number,, of years and the
accident is a very- regretable one
"Uncle' John had frequently been
employed in this city, whero he was
well known nnd liked.
