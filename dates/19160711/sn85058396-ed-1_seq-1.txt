onette hill which dominates the valley
of the Somme and from which every
thing that happens in Peronne can be
II observed, one of the primary objects
of the Anglo-French offensive, has

m the British remain in possession ot
fflk Contalmaison, holding it against Ger-
man counter attacks and furious shell
fire. Fighting continued through the
night from Ovillers and La Boiselle
to Trones wood. The British, bomb
ing their way forward, gained consid
erably in Mametz wood and took all
except the point of the 'fiercely disput
ed pear-shaped Trones wood, clearing
the way with each step toward the
German second line on the ridges be
yond. The infantry is at such close quar
ters in the woods that the guns on
neither side are firing at the first line
for fear of hitting their own men.
Overhead shells are screaming past
in the reserves, to keep assistance
from those in the front positions.
French Capture 1300 Men. '
Pans, July 11, 12:15 p. m The

south of the Somme the French in
the last two days have taken more
than 1300 prisoners.
On the Verdun front the Germans
launched an attack at four o'clock

tive artillery fighting in the neigh
borhood of Avocourt and Chattau
court. Northeast of Veho the Germans
exploded four mines the craters of
which eventually were occupied by
the French.
The communication says:
"On both bides of the Somme the
night passed in quiet. The total num
ber of prisoners taken by us south of
the Somme In the fighting of the last
few days is now more than 300.
"On the left bank of the Meuse.
there were severe artillery engage
ments in the sectors of Avocourt and
Chattancourt. To the right of the
river the bombardment yesterday of
our positions from Fleury to a point
east of Chenois was redoubled in in
tensity. At 4 o'clock this morning
the Germans delivered an attack overt
the whole front thus bombarded. East
; of Fumin wood and Chenois wood the
; enemy gained a foothold in our ad
vanced trenches but immediately was
' ejected by counter attacks. Elsewhere
our curtain of fire and our machine
guns broke up the attacks of the ene

with grenades. North of La Fontaln
aille a surprise attack on the trench
esSif the enemy enabled us to pene
trate first line trenches and a support
trench which we cleared out. We
brought back some prisoners."
London, July 11, 2:04 p. m. The
British captured Contalmaison on the
French line last night, the war office
nnnounced today. Several trenches

Officers Have Been Accepted
and Localities for Recruiting
Commands Have Been
Designated.
New York, July 11 Colonel Roose
velt's plans for his proposed division
have been perfected to the extent
that officers have been accepted and
tho localities from which their com
mands are to be recruited designated.
From western Colorado, Wyoming,
Utah and Nevada at least one cavalry
regiment has been accepted. It would
receive its preliminary training either
at Fort Douglas, Utah, or Fort D. A,
Russell, Wyoming, before joining the
rest of the division at Fort Sill, Okla
homa. Rock Channing, former Princeton
and All-American football player who
served with Roosevelt's Rough Riders
in the Cuban campaign and is now
president of the Utah Consoli
dated Mining company at Salt Lake
City, has been selected by Colonel
Rooseelt to raise this regiment and
an officer, detailed from the regular
army for service with it, chosen.
Troops have been provisionally ac
cepted from all the states named and
plans prepared for their rapid con
centration and training in case of
war.
Salt Lake City, Utah, July 11. The
announcement from New York that
Rock Channing, president of the Utah
Consolidated Mining company, had
been selected by Colonel Roosevelt to
raise a regiment of cavalry in Colo
rado, Wyoming, .Utah am, Nevada was
received here with interest. The
states named, with Idaho furnished a
Rough Rider regiment for tho Span
Ish war In 1S9S, which was com
manded by Colonel Jay L. Torrey of
Wyoming, and was known as the Sec
ond United States Volunteer Cavalry.
This regiment was mobilized at Fort
D. A. Russell, Wyoming, and was
transferred from there to Jackson
ville, Florida, where It remained in
camp until the Cuban war closed.
Many of the members of this regi
ment would, without doubt, seek
membership In the Roosevelt regiment.

they will be infected by infantile
paralysis from children fleeing the
plague in the metropolis. A number
of cities and towns in New Jersey

antines and some are turning back all
children from New York City. Pater

Inexhaustible Numbers of Men
Brought Up and Cavalry
Kept at Full Strength.
Berlin, via I oudon, July 10, 10:35
p. m. The Tageblatt's correspondent
at Austrian press headquarters
wires:
"The Russian army against which
we are battling today is not the same
army as a year ago. It draws its sol
diers from the Inexhaustible reser
voir of European and Asiatic Russia,
aud even though the material is not
on the whole comparable with our
men, nevertheless, it fills the gaps
with fresh forces and increases the
army's numerical strength. The "Rus
sian cavalry formations have not
grown larger, but they remain at their
former full strength which," consid
ering their gigantic losses in horses,
is saying mucUi
'On the artillery side every divi
sion has been increased with a sec

teries of 75 millimeter field guns and

Baltimore, Md., July 11 There will
be no objection on the part of Captain
Paul Koenig, commander of the Ger
man submarine Deutschland, to an in
spection of his craft by officers of
the United States navy. This was an
nounced by Captain Koenig today,
after the arrival from Washington of
Captain C. F. Hughes and two of the
navy's submarine experts assigned to
aid the collector of the port to aid in
determining the status of the vessel
Captain Koenig has not up to noon
received from the navy officers a re
quest to be permitted tomake the
inspection
"If officers from the United States
navy department with proper creden
tials come to me and ask to inspect
my vessel, I shall not make any ob
jection. My orders are to let no one
aboard except those legally entitled
to the privilege and I assume that of
ficers designated by the American
navy have that right. I have no right.
I have no secrets to conceal. I have
hot1 a"s yet. however, received any
communication from Captain Hughes
or the collector of the port In regard
to the matter."
Meantime Captain Hughes and his
two assistants had boarded a tug
boat and gone to the pier where the
Deutschland was moored.
The officers, Captain C. F. Hughes
and two submarine experts, Lieuten
ant J. O. Fisher of the bureau of
steam engineering, and Naval Con
structor Herbert S. Howard, accom
panied by the collector of the port,
boarded the Deutschland at her pier
from a tug. Officially they were to
determine whether the submarine
was an armed vessel but they were
given permission by Captain Koenig
to make a complete inspection. Cap
tain Koenig said there was nothing
to conceal.
Captain Spells Name.
Captain Koenig settled today the
question over the spelling of his
name. "I spell it K-O-N-I-G." he
said, "with an umlaut over the '0.'
To convey the sound correctly in
English it should be spelled K'O-E-N-I-G."
Captain Hughes finished his inspec
tion of the Deutschland about 2 p. m.
He declined to discuss what he had
determined as the status of the craft
saying he would make his report la
ter to Collector Ryan.
"I saw everything connected with
the Deutschland except the bottom
of her hull," said Captain Hughes, "I
went over her entirely for the pur
pose of establishing her status and
have done so."
Will Leave Within Ten Days.
It was explained to Captain Koe
nig by the custom officials that tin
sealing of the Deutschland's wireless
would be required in accordance with
the rules laid down by the govern
ment soon after the outbreak of the
war to prevent violations of neutral
ity b; ships of belligerent nations in
American ports.
Captain Koenig said he expected to
start on his return trip within ten
days and was not concerned about
the regulation.
Baltimore, Md- July 11. The Ger
man merchant submarine Deutschland
may begin today to discharge her
cargo, principally dyestuffs unless dip
lomatic complications arise. While no
comment has been made by any one
connected with the vessel on the ac
tion of the navy department In detail
ing Captain C. F. Hughes to make a
formal survey of her for the govern
ment, it is thought no objection will
be raised. He was appointed at the
suggestion of Assistant Secretary of
State Polk and in line with tjie gov
ernment's course to establish without
a doubt the exact character of the
vessel.
The Deutschland's cargo when dis
charged will be placed in a bonded
warehouse to be disposed of later by
the local representatives of the ves
sel's owners.
Shipment of Nickel.
A question has arisen whether the
submarine will be permitted to take
back to Germany a largo quantity of
nickel that is on the dock to which she
is moored. Shipment of nickel to the
United States' from Canada, which is
the world's greatest producer of this
metal, has been allowed on condition
that Its distribution should be so con
trolled that none could reach the cen
' tral powers. The Cauadlun govern-
ment is said to bo considering the
new situation.
An emphatic statement was made
by Henry G-. Hiiken of the 'firm which
represents t,he Deutschland owners
that under no circumstances will any
passengers be carried on the submar
ine on her return trip. He said pro
vision was made for only the crew
and that it would be impossible to
take any other of the applicants for
passage who are said to have offered
$5,000 each Mr. Hiiken said smiling
ly that he expected the submarine to
leave "about Christmas" but It is
understood she will depart within a
week.
The Deutschland is moored within
a quarter of a mile from the place
where the first submarine test was
made 19 years ago of the first boat
to successfully navigate under water.
This was the Argonaut, invented by
Simon Lake, who came to Baltimore
yesterday to personally congratulate
Captain Koenig of the Deutschland on
the ifeat he had accomplished
No Diplomatic Complications.
Washington, July 11. No diplo
matic complications were seen by fed
eral officials today in the arrival at

There were no prospects today that
representatives of the allied govern
ments would protest if the submarine
Is held to be a merchant vessel. The
British and French governments have
asked the state department to satisfy
itself as to the vessel's character but
no protest as to the vessel's entrance
into American-waters. was made.
Naval officers have been detailed
to assist the Baltimore officials. Offi
cials put little faith In a rumor that
there might be a close examination
on the ground that it was a secret
type of construction.
Deutschland a Peaceful Ship.
State department officials today ex
pressed belief, based upon unofficial
information, that the Deutschland
would be declared a peaceful, unarmed
merchantman and entitled 10 all privi
leges of an ordinary cargo carrier
Acting Secretary Polk said he expect-,
ed no protests from the allied gov
ernments against such a decision.
The state department, it was offi
cially declared, will not concern itself
with reported objections by Canadian
nickel Interests lo exportation of nick
el on the Deutschland. Agreements
of American purchasers of Canadian
nickel not to re-export the metal, Act
ing Secretary Polk explained, was
purely private and no resort could be
had to the state department to Inter
fere with nickel shipments on the Ger
man super-submarine.
Captain C. P. Hughes, assigned by
the navy department to aid treasury
officials in determining the status of
the Deutschland, went to Baltimore
today accompanied by Lieutenant J.
O Fisher of the bureau of steam en
gineering and Naval Constructor Her
bert S. Howard. Lieutenant Fisher
was recently attached to the staff d
Rear Admiral Grant, commander ot
the submarine flotilla.
Acting Secretary Polk pointed out
that the state department is concern
ed with the vessel itself and not with
the disposal of her cargo. The latter
Is subject to the treasury department s
regulations.

TAMPICO STORY DENIED H
Villistas Separate Into Two Di- M
visions, One of Which H
Headed for Texas Border. H
Washington, July ll. General Car- H
ranza has been notified that negotia- H
tions for the settlement of the border jH
difficulties need not await the return IH
of Secretary Lansing from his vaca- jH
It is expected here that Carranza H
will propose a formal conference, H
rather than informal conversations, H
between Ambassador Arredondo1 and IH
the state department American of- H
ficials will accede to any plan which IH
assures quick action. H
War department officials had no re-
ports upon anu discounted rumors or h
a revolt in the Carranza garrison at H
Chihuahua City. The Mexican em- l
bassy issued a formal denial of the H
report. H
Reports credited to American H
refugees that two American sailors
were killed recently were denied by H
the state and navy departments. Of-
ficials said that the story was based H
upon an incident at Tarapico, June 25 H
or 26, when Carranza soldiers fired H
upon a privately-owned American tug H
and no one was hurt. H
Acting Secretary Polk, in the ab- H
sence of Secretary Lansing, attended H
the cabinet meeting today, and re- H
ported upon the informal conversa- H
tions he had with Mr Arredondo. IH
Villistas in Two Bands. H
The Villa bandits, who attacked the H
Carranza garrison at Jiminez and Cor- H
ralitos last week, were reported todaj H
in dispatches to the Mexican embassy H
here to have separated into two divis- H
ions, one going northward toward the M
Texas border and the other pushing M
toward Chihuahua into Durango state. H
A message from Andreas Garcia, H
Carranza consul at El Paso, said that H
troops of the de facto government In H
sufficient numbers to destroy the H
bandits had followed them in close H
pursuit. H
Border reports that the Carranza H
garrison at Santa Rosalia had revolt- H
ed and joined forces with the bandits H
were denied by Consul Garcia. M

El Paso, Texas, July 11. The Fifth jH
Massachusetts Infantry today was or- JA
dercd to the border for patrol duty, H
the first of tho eastern military or- M
ganizatlons coming here to see active 1
service. Transportation of the guards- 1

Chihuahua, Mexico, July 11. The H
main body of the Villa force retreat- H
ing from Jimenez today attacked Par- H
ral. 50 miles to the southwest but was H
defeated bv tho Carranza garrison H
after a savage battle, according to in H
official report received by General H
Jacinto Trevino. M
The report sent in by General Er- jH
nesto Garcia, commander at Parral, m
says that the bandits, suffering heavy tM
losses, retreated to Sombreretillo, a H
few miles southeast of Parral. It adds H
that If thev make a stand there the H
deciding battle of the Villista cam- H
palgn should be fought late today, or H
tomorrow as the de 'facto government s H
cavalry under Generals Domingo Ar- H
rieta and Matlas Ramos is almost IH
within striking distance of this place. Vm
General Garcia gives no details ot IH
the fighting Which ne describes as H
vorv savage, promising to Rend a lull H
description of the battle later Hp H
says, however, that It was evidently H
the Villistas intention lo drive off tho H
Parral garrison so that the, town could H
be looted and perhaps more ammunl- H
lion obtained. H
