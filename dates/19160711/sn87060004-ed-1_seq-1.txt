Personal Notes at The Fort
Ft. Thomas, Ky. The boys from
the "Pennyrile" dealt the citv boys
from Louisville a solar plexus blow
Saturday afternoon. Inddently the
officers from rural companies are ju
bilant and have won the argument as
to whether the city bred chap or the
"outside" guardsmen make the best
soldiers.
It all came about this way. The
entire camp had been wondering what
would comc next after the United
States Medical examiners cut through
the ranks of the First and left only
mere peace strengths. The officers of
the regiment from Louisville thought
they had the fiower of the troops from
the Kentucky brigade and were deeply
hurt when the examiners completed
their work.
Saturday evening the muster and
examination of the Third Kentucky
regiment which hails from the heart
of the "Pennyrile" was started. It
was with keen surprise the officers
from the other regiments sat back and
heard the result of the examination.
The F. Company from Providence
Capt. Arthur Donan, commanding
had gone through the examination
with ninety-seven men, and three of
ficers, and lost only two men. Still
more surprised were the officers when
B. Company from Henderson, Capt.,
Harvey Higginson commanding, re
ported that out of 127 men and three
officers only ten
men had been'r&Tr-
jected.
Officers from Louisville had thought
their troops from the city would stand
on a par with the rest, but the whole
test collapsed when lhese boys pre
sented themselves Physicians had
begun to think of what the young
men had been doing to turn up so
many physical defects.
It was ijo wonder that Major J.
W. Grissinger turned to the captain
of F. company from Providence and
asked if he was sending his best men
in first. Major Grissinger was still
more surprised when he had seen the
entire company and had gazed upon
the finest specimens of manhood that
has ever passed through the physical
tests.
The boys of the Third Regiment
may not have looked so snappy in
their uniforms, but underneath the
quality was there.
News From The Fort
The 3rd Kentucky Hospital Corps
was a wilted looking bunch Saturday
morning after having taken, the day
before, the second shot of typhoid
serum. It struck in and there were
stiff muscles, drowsiness, and a gen
eral done-for feeling on tlie part of
most of the boys. Some few were
not hard hit and those who were
threw it off by Sunday morning, when
all looked as chipper as larks and
were ready for anything. They went
to Sundaydinner with appetites ready
to add to their weight against the
physical examination they were
scheduled for that afternoon, early.
Whether it was the peach cobbler or
something else they were all comfort,
able and confident of the results of
the coming examination. And it
came to pass. The results were flat
tering. Johnnie Hodge was rejected
because of a crippled foot. Wallace
and Paul Jones did not take the ex
animation, having been rejected pre
viously on account of being under
age and without parent's consent.
They are expected to leave for home
in a few days. All men who do not
pass for any reason will be sent home
soon that is after the question of
transportation is unraveled.
Those men who may come under
the provision for discharge cn ac-
count of leaving c"ependent families
at home wi 1 not get out of the ser
vice without some formality and de
lay. A form will be prescribed by
the War Department, perhaps in the
way of affidavit to set out the facts
in legal form and produce some cer
tification as to their truth. After the
form is prescribed it is expected that
these men will present their proofs
without delay and then be formally
relieved.
Capt. Frank Thomas, chaplain of
the Third, who is held in highest es
teem by the men of that organization
of which he is himself a veteran mem
ber, speaks very highly of the Third
Kentucky Hospital Corps, as a body
of fine young gentlemen of whom he
is proud-
Speaking of Dr. Thomas and the
matter of his resignation of the posl
tion of chaplain. Upon best author
ity it may be said that he will not go
to the border, because his church
work in the broad field of the M. E.
Church, South, is of such weighty
importance this year that he could
not afford to leave it. ?He is in just
the same position ps to his resigna-
tion as any other officer Until he
has been mustered into the Federal
service there will be nobody who can
accept lils resignation, though it was
offered some time ago. Of course
Ellington friends of Rev. J. S.
Hawkins are hoping he" may prove
the successful applicant to succeed to
this important office. That he would
nil it with credit , none who know
him deny.
Sunday Gen. Roger Williams was
at Lexington with his family, but he
was 'officially present" at the Fort.
So that Major" Frank D. Rash, Bri
gade Adjutant, was in effect "it" for
the day. Colonel Jouett Henry,
ranking colonel, would have stepped
into command in case of anyemerg.
ency, but the day was peacefnlly
calm.
G. Company shows up fins in
some particulars. On Wednesday
morning at "sick call" there was
not a single sick man reported. This
record was repeated Sunday morn
ing, though there was one sick man
in the company that morning who
was too sick to report and was cared
for on a cot at company quarters.
An officer of the Hospital Corps said
this gives G. company the record tor
the Third. V
The "G" men each take a bath

rence by His Oldest
Friend
JOHN TlVANS
The body of Mr. John Liw
rence, an old resident of Earling-.
ton, and an old vetoran miner
with the S. Bernard Mining Co.

Uncle Johnnie as ha wa fami.
liary called, was 07 years old and

For the last 12 or 15 yoata

Two years ago the old man rc-
alizid he was a great sinner and
sought a saviour in the person of
Jesus Christ and, committed him
self to the mercy of God and
gave testimony that his sins were
pardoned.
The St Bernard Minine Co.. de
serve great praise for the kind
treatment and Generous feelincr
fhown towards John Lawrence;
bearing all tha expense incured
in the burial, and it is worthy of

while they live and at death give
them a decent burial.
