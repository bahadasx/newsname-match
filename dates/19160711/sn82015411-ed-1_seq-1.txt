HOW KAUAI CELEBRATED
THE GLORIOUS FOURTH
The Fourth of July program in
Lihue was a grand success from
every viewpoint. It was the first
time in the history of the island
that a military observance of the
national occasion had been at
tempted, or had been possible;
the first time that Kauai hod been
honored with the presence of the
Governor on Independence Day;
the first time that the program for
the Glorious Fourth had tver been
an all-day one, and the events
were witnessed bv the largest
crowd ever assembled together on
this island in its known history,
The program was a very com
prehensive one, and although it
was started on time and proceeded
with due precision and speed it
ran about an hour and a half over
the time calculated for it in the
afternoon. In spite ot all this,
however, the great crowd "stayed
with it" and seemed to enjoy it
immensely.
BANQUET AT THE
HOTEL FAIRVIEW
One of the most important and
i pleasant events of Fourth of July
week was a banquet given by
Governor Pinkham at the Fair
view Hotel Thursday evening to
officers of the National Guard and
ptomiuent citizens. Covers were
laid for eighty.
The decorations were the most
beautiful seen or. Kauai in quite
awhile, the handiwork of ladies
of the Mokihana Club. Flags,
bunting, ferns, palms, etc,,
abounded. The color scheme of
the dining hall was red, white and
blue, fashioned in " flowers; while
yellow-was the color of flowers ar
ranged here and there throughout
the neighboring halls and lanai.
A stringed orchestra supplied
music.
General Johnson was toastmas
ter of the occasion. The speakers
were Governor Pinkham. Colontl
E. H. W. Broadbent. Colonel Z.
S. Spalding, Colonel Lincoln and
Hon. H. D. Wishard.
During the evening several toasts
were proposed, the final one being
to the Governor. When it was
drunk the assemblage broke out
spontaneously with the notes of
"He's a jolly good fellow." This
brought the affair to a close, the
party then adjourning to the "sec
ond chapter" of the evening's
program the grand ball in Lihue
Social hall.

THE
UP WAILUA RIVER
Some twenty live members of thi1
Ou Club, with their guests, made
the famous Wailua lmat excursion
last Sunday.
Assembling at the bridge early in
the afternoon, the party embarked
in one of the large rice boats, and
with main sail set, were soon run
ning before a stiff breeze, headed
for the south branch of the river.
After admiring the beauties of
this part of the river, the boat was
turned around and the party pro
ceeded back toward the other brunch
of the stream, where an appropriate
pot had been set out in readiness
for the picnic- part of the program,
which was thoroughly well enjoyed
by all. Around a blight log (ire
stories were swapped and songs sung
until the moon was well above the
horizon, when the return trip was
begun. The evening being quite
perfect, the ride was much enjoyed
by the party, who declared the af
fair among the most successful
which the club had undertaken.

ORATORY ON THE
FOURTH OF JULY
Two splendid addresses added
urreat weight to the lituary sic
tion of t li e program on July
Fourth. These were bv Governor
Pinkham ami Rev. C. D. Mil
liken. The foriiRi was published
the same dav in Iloufdulu, so is
rami I ted here. Rev. Mr Millikiu
said:
Mr. Chairman; Voiir Excellency,
Governor Pinkham. Mtnitars f
the National Guard ; Fellow Citi
zens: It is appropriate to recall our
country's first birthday because of
its association with the Dechn.ition
of Independence to the reading of
which we have betu listening.
The thirteen British colonies in
Noitli America were met in Con
gress in the city of Philadelphia:
a member from Virginia intro
duced the resolution that the
United Qolonies are and ot right
ought to be free ami independent
states. Five men were chosen to
draw up a declaration embodying
that resolution. Thomas Jeffer
son, tlnrtv three years of age,
afterward president, a lawyer well
versed in both literature and poli
tical history was chosen to draft
the instrument. During its com
posing he consulted no books but
wrote from the overflowing fulness
of his mind, On the 4th of Julv,
1776, one hundred forty years ago
the president ot the Congress, John
Hancock, of Massachusetts, signed
the Declaration of American In
dependence in h i s bold hand
which could be read without spec
tacles by the near-sighted foreign
oppressor. Then those patriots
rang old liberty bell with joyous
peal. The thirteen British Colo
nies had ceased to exist. In their
place stood a new nation, the
unitea states ot America, your
country and mine.
Last summer at the Exposition
in San Francisco it was my privi
lege to see ahd touch this same
old liberty bell now cracked and
tarnished by the ravages of time.
Hundreds of thousands ot citizens,
young and old, thronged to gaze
reverently upon it, an honored
relic that shall be sacredly guard
ed as long as a grateful land,
whose birth its ringing celebrated
shall endure.
The Hawaiian Islands on which
our lot is cast, in the midst of the
vast Pacific are now a part and
parcel of the United States. The
inhabitants, of different race and
color, comprise peoples who have
come hither trom lauds scattered
far and wide upon the surface of
the earth: and in these days when
other nations are being torn as-
sunder bv hatred and the clash ot
arms our heterogenous popula
tion sends its sympathies, each to
his own mother-land in the hour
of her trial; sends them naturally
as a child sends affection to a pa
rent in trouble, no matter how
widely separated child and parent
may be. But it is incumbent upon
us native citizens of our own
country, in the midst of perilous
conditions like these, to do what
can be done to re-create in every
alien who has come hither to
make his home a spirit of unfail
ing loyalty to his adopted country,
loyalty of that true and reliable
quality that shall not be found
renegade, should ever the dark hour
of war threaten our land.
The United States and its pos
sessions are unique among the
nations of earth in that they have
allowed to enter their confines
peoples o f everv nation under
heaven, such as scriptural phraseo
logy would designate, Parthians,
Medes, Elamites. Ethiopians and
t h e dwellers in Mesopotamia,
Paraphilia. Pontus and Asia; and
we hear them speaking each in
his own tongue. A national dif
ficulty now being encountered is
this heterogenous character of our
population being so si owl v re
duced to a homogeneous civiliza
tion. It is easier for this Terri
tory to become an international
UN
PRESENTS COLORS
One of the prettiest ceremonies
of Independence Day at Lihue
park was the presentation bv the
Mokiliniia Club of a beautiful,
silk. United Slates flag to tin
Fourth Infantiv. The formal
presentation was made by Mrs. J.
M, Lvdgatc. vice president of the
club, who said:
Col. E. 11. W. Broadbent, offi
cers and men of the 4th Infantry,
National Guard ot Hawaii"
In the absence of tnc Presidtnt,
it devolves upon me to present to
yon these colors ou behalf ol the
Mokihana Club of Lihue.
In doing so 1 beg to express out
profound appreciation of the ser
vice you are lenderinig. in thus
organizing and equipping for the
defense ot our homes and our liber
ties. We recognize that this service
is rendered at t!i.e cost of much
personal sacrifice, much strenuous
endeavor and many trving condi
tions.
That these sacrifices and these
endeavors arc made without hope
of gain or advantage, purely from
a sense of du:y and patriotism,
this is a matter of great satisfaction
and much assurance.
With such men to defend our
homes and our liberties, the future
may hold problems for us, but it
can hardly hold any serious dis
aster, This flag that now waves o'er our
land
Protecting weak and strong,
Is the flag that vindicates the right
And punishes the wrong.
Colonel Broadbent responded
briefly to this address, thanking
the ladies for their thoughtfulness.
A regimental flag, which failed
to arrive on time, will reack the
Fourth Infantry at a later date.
Mahelona Hospital
The contract for the lumber for
the Sam Mahelona hospital for the
treatment of tuberculosis has been
let to the Kauai Railway Company.
A foreman and workmen will ar
rive from Honolulu in a few days
and actual wotk of building the
hospital will begin in a few days.
Died Of Typhoid
One of the Japanese children
removed from Nawiliwili to the
hospital, ill of typhoid fever, suc
cumbed to the disease. This is the
only death among the number of
cases treated in the past several
months.
E. A. Knudsen has aranged an
outing foi the Boy Scouts at his
mountain house in August, notice
of which is given elsewhere in this
issue.
The Lihue Ice Co. kindly left a
case of Grape Smack at the Gar
den Island office last week. Thank
you, Captain.
melting-pot than it is for the main
body of the United States. A
prominent army officer has lately
said, "We talk about the United
States being a great melting pot,
it is hardly a melting pot at all;
it is a pot but there is dreadful
little melting being done. Big
chunks of foreign folk are being
thrown into it and they remain
just as distinct chunks after as be
fore." We have never become so
painfully aware of this as now
when their respective homelands
abroad are tearing at each others'
throats. So vast this task of melt
ing and so slow the process, that
uenerai wood sees no progress
being made. Yet we will reas
sure ourselves that though the
mills of gods grind slowly they
grind exceeding sure.
This unique situation unlike
that in any other world-power de

leled conditions call for unparallel
ed activities that shall be system
