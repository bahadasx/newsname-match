"We desire permanent peace; per
manent peace can grow only in one
soil. That is a soil of actual good will,
and good will cannot come without
mutual comprehension.

"The ln'il says that a people have a
right to lo anything they pe;,se wilh

The tirci-id, lit then spoke of the val

ded: ! "Vou cannot hate a man oii know-.
(1 know some ra-ials that I have tried
to hate. I have tried to head thorn
i off as rascals but I have been unable
ilo hate them. In the relationship of

antagonisms are based upon ' misun
derstandings and as long as you do
not understand a country yon cannot
trade with it. As long as yon cann'd
lake its point of view you cannot com
mend .your goods to its purchase.
"This, then, my friends, is the sim
ple message that I bring you; Lift
your eyes to the horizons of business;
but do not look Ion close to tilt- little

lerned, but let your thoughts and
vour imaginations run abroad
throughout the whole world and with

Opposed to Trustee Theory.
In the secftiil speech delivered by
I'rcsident Wilson he made at the
luncheon al the Detroit Athletic club,
he declared:
"Some democrats have noticed lhal
the inclination to suppose that only
some persons understood the business
of America has a tendency to run
Into the assumption that the number
of persons who understood that busi
ness is very small and that there are
only certain groups and associations
o gentlemen who were entitled to be
trustees of that business for the rest
of us. i have never subscribed in any
walk of life to Ihe trustee theory. I
always have been inclined to believe
that the business of the world was
best understood by those men who
were in the struggle for maintenance,
not . .ills-, but for success.
"The man who knows the strength
of the tide is tile man who is swim
ming against it, not the man who is
flouting wilh it The man who is Im
mersed in the beginning of business,
who is trying to gel his fooihold. who
is trying to get other men lo believe
in him and lend him money and trust
him to make profitable use of that
money, Is the man who knows what
I he- business lOlldiliollS ill the I'llited

bis counsel as to whiii ought to be

The forces of the (Jet man crown

have been confined to bombardments.
