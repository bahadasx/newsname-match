f SAYS DRPET TOLD
TRUTH 1 STAID
Defence Declares OrpetHad
Every Motive for Not Kill
ing Marian Lambert.
Waukegan. Ill , July 11 .Argument
for the defence was begun today by
Leslie P Hanna in behalf of Will H.
Orpet, on trial charged with the mur
der of Marian Lambert
"The defendant," said Mr. Hanna,
"took the stand as a fair witness. The
shock of his arrest and of Marian's
death had worn off. He was no longer
the frightened youth who. without
counsel, talked erratically perhaps, jnst
after his arrest.
"It would have been folly for him to
nave taken the stand unless he was to
tell the truth, and the whole truth."
Says Orpet Wh Hounded.
"Where he was arrested the whole
current of his life was changed." went
on the lawyer. "Officers of the law be-
! sieeed Mm and the newspapers cried
! 'murder, murder." it seemed to him
as though the whole world was arrayed
against him. -He simply did his best
until the advice to which he was en
titled came to his assistance "
Mr. Hanna referred to attorney Jos
lyn's cross examination of Orpet as
"brutal and unfair." and warned the
jurors that they jtere not to remember
Mr. Joslyn's inslnuving questions, but
Orpet's replies to them.
Mr. Hanna walked up close to the
Jury box and spoke in a voice so'softlv
confidential that those In the audience
could not hear him. Speaking of the
defendant's flight from the girl's body
he said:
"Don t place too much weight on
this. The lad of 20. incapable of con
fronting such a shock and the exposure I
to maturity would have stayed"
Taking up the subject of motive as
outlined by the prosecution to the ef
fect that Marian's exposure meant ex
posure to Orpet. Mr. Hanna said:
Murdrr or Suletde Meant Exposure.
"Marian's death by suicide let alone
murder, meant exposure to him if the
facts alleged by the state art- accepted.
The chances of exposure with Marian
in the living were as nothing com
pared to the certainty of it if she died
by violence."
"But after all." went on the lawyer,
"the backbone of the state's case was
founded on the belief that the cyanide
of potassium which killed Marian Lam
bert was a part of that in the green
house over which the defendant's fath
er had control. That factor has dis
appeared and with its disappearance
appeareu ine innocence oi this defen
dant. The state admits that the green
house substance was not cyanide of
potassium but cyanide of sodium."
Mr. Hanna was followed by state's
attorney Ralph Dady.
