The June term of the Boone County
Circuit Court will probably close to
morrow. The divorce suit of Carrie
against Robert Thomas Algeo, reset
from June 2fi is the only case to be

in several other divorce suits which
were tried June 2G and which he took
under advisement. He may also give
his decision in the case of the Sturgeon
Special Hbail District against the
Roane County Court, tried yesterday
The partition suit of John M. Wright

others, the only case set for today,
was still being tried late this after

term of court.
i:TKAMA TO COME TIHRSDAY
Columbia Brown- Schedule Extra
Came for Loral Fairground.
Centralia will take another crack at
the Columbia Ilrowns for that fi-to-1
defeat of Sunday before last when the
two teams meet in an exhibition game
at the fairgrounds here Thursday.
The Braves have braced up since
that occasion. That was the last of a
string of successive losses that let
them dawn into the cellar of the Cen
tral Missouri League, and the defeats
stung tlie citizens of Centralia into
demanding a winning ball club. They
have one now, as the lS-to-0 win over
Paris last Sunday will bear witness.
Manager Taylor will probably enter
l-ao Roberts, the high school lad who
pitched so well against Moberly the
Fourth of July. This will be Colum
bia's first chance to see the school
bin lefthander in action. The game
mil -tart at 3:30 o'clock.

'Only six out of a possible hundred
go through high school in this coun
try." said I'nrd 1!. Wright, head of
the public library of Kansas City, in
his talk on "Some Methods of Attract
ing Hoys and (lirls to The Public Li
brary" at the University Assembly this
morning. , "The aim of the public li
brary is to reach the 94 per cent who
do not have a high school education
as well as the r, per cent who do. We
ate trying to teach them that the use
of the library docs not end when they
leave school."
Mr. Wright then (old the story of
linnnie Casey. He said a small boy
came to him one day to get a hook on
how to throw a spitball. After the
mysteries of a library card had been
solved, Jimniie took the book home.
Not long afterward he came and
brought his baseball team, and each
got the book which gave the "dope"
on playing his position.
Later Jimniie became interested in
wireless. Since he did not have the
money to buy the appartus, a group
of interested business men made it
possible for him to earn it. Now he is
in the Manual Training High School
and is planning to attend the Univer
sity. Mr. Wright told of the success of
Frank 15. St. Clair and how it began
with his going to the public library
to satisfy a persistent desire to know
"why."
"Surely", said Jlr. Wright, "things
