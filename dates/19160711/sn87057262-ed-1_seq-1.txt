COURT ROOM, WAUKEb-AN, 111.,
July 11.—The anomalous position of
the defense asking the. death penalty
for its client, if convicted, and She
state asking merely a prison sent
ence, was in prospect in Will- Orpet's
trial for Marian Lambert's murder
today.
As the dosing arguments proceed
ed, it was learned that the defense
will ask the jury to eliminate half
way measures, and either hang or
free Orpet.
Special Prosecutor Joslyn, on the
contrary,
was expected to ask a pris­
on sentence as an "object leseon."
tor the defense today,
Attorney Leslie P. Hanna declared if
the Jury was convinced of Orpet's
guilt, it was its duty td convict him,
tout that if it had any doubts at all, It
must free him.
"This defendant Is on trial only
for murder," Hanna said. "He has
explained all. his aids. He has con
cealed nothing. A guilty man could
not have stood the brutal cross ex
amination that Orpet underwent,
with his story unchaken. 'He took the
blame for his acts befiore the trag
edy. He is not on trial for them."
States Attorney Dady, who follow
ed Hanna, declared It was important
the jury consider punishment of
Orpet because of the effect the trag
edy had on the iminds of young people.
The closing arguments are expected
to occupy at least two days more,
after today.
Orpet's counsel warned the youth
today against further outbreaks in
court. With shouts of "you are a
liar," Orpet interrupted Assistant
State's Attorney Kunyard yesterdad,
when Runyard branded him a dirty,
scheming murderer.

'Rumor That the British Cruisers Al

Beyond Three'Milo -v
Limit.
BALTIMORE, Md., July 11.—Repre
sentatives of both the American and
German governments were slated to
day to cast critical eye* upon the
super-submarine freighter Deutsch
land here.
Captain Hughes, U. Ss N., was due
to examine her for armament Ger
man Ambassador Von Bernstorff to
inspect her as a marvel of German
efficiency and daring.
United States authorities here, as
well as the Deutschland's consignees,
felt Hughes' technical Inspection
would reveal what they had already
adjudged—that the vessel is unarmed
and strictly a peaceful merchantman,
entitled to privileges and protection
In American harbors. There was a
possibility, however, that the con
signees would balk at Hughes' visit-
The enormous deep sea rover still
lay under strictest guard at her pier
on the outskirts of the city today.
Stolid armed Germans, reinforced by
city poUce, saw to it that the curious
were kept at a distance. Trusted
German longshoremen were the only
ones admitted nearby.
The tlme ftf ,the DeutsfihlaniTs da
parture with her rubber and nickel
cargo was still kept secret—and will
be.
In this connection the story went
that England may send over some
motor patrols and some of her big
ocean netB to entangle the Deutsch
land after she dashes out to sea from
the Patapsco river. Rumor had it,
too, that British cruisers are already
concentrating beyond the' three mile
limit.
Captain Koenig, however, only
shrugged his shoulders, smiled a
strange little smile and commented:
"As you Americans say, 'we should
worry' as long as the allies don't vio
late the three mile limit law."
It was thought here that the
Deutschland's sister ship Bremen will
come to Baltimore eventually, even
though it may visit Rio Janeiro as
despatches from there stated today.
One prospect of trouble for the
Deutschland lay in the visit of Simon
Lake, submarine inventor, who frank
ly says that the Deutschl.ind outward
ly appears to be an Infringement of
his patents, though he was not pre
pared to say what actioa, if any hfe
plans against her. He wlil not libel
her here, at any rate, he seys.
Manager Hilken, of the Ocean
Transportation compan, owners of the
Deutschland, announced this fore
noon that personally he objects to
Captain Hughes' examination of the
ship. He will not decide to refuse
him permission to enter the vessel,
however, until Hughes presents him
self and Hilken has had opportunity
fo confer with Captain Hinch, super
intendent ot transportation.

BALTIMORE, Md., July 11.—If
Captain Hughes, U. S. N., presents
proper United States government
credentials. Captain Koenig, daring
commander of the German super-sub
marine Deutschland, will permit him
to Inspect that vessel.
Koenig took the position today that
Hughes must be "entitled by law to

to permit any one on the giant cargo

Hughes had not asked permission

[By Carl W. Ackerman, United Press
Staff Correspondent,]
BE2RILJN, July 11.—The great al
lied offensive will end In defeat with
in a few weeks and will be followed
by negotiations tor peace, in the
opinion of well informed persons in
Berlin.
The .check admlnlstered-to the Birlt
ish in the death struggle north of
Somme, has given rise to the nation
al hope that peace will follow the
fighting in Pioardy, which has been,
marked by unprecedented slaughter.
The German people are practically a
unit in believing the attempt of the
allies to force the German line is
doomed to failure.
Except on one narrow sector, the
British have been unable to make
any perceptible impression on the
German lines, despite their over
whelming superiority In men. Im
petuous dashes have frequently car
ried General Kaig'a men into German
positions, where they were immed
iately cut off and killed or captured.
The French, more prudent, have
made sopae progress south of the
Somme. but thus far neither French
nor British have developed the pow
erful attack necessary to break com
pletely the deadlock in the west and
roll the Germans out of France and
Flanders. The feeling prevails here
that when the extent of the British
losses becomes fully known in Eng
land, coupled with the fact that the
German line still remains Intact,
public opinion will demand that
peace be made without further slaugh
ter.
German experts are quite certain
that the British will never quit the
attack without first feeling out other
sectors of the German front in the
hope of finding an opening. But
they are confident that the British
will have no greater success against
the strongly fortified fines further
north, than they have had between
the Ancre and the Somme.
Some of the more optimistic of the
German correspondents, notably the
correspondent at the front of the
Vossische Zeitung, believe that the
allied offensive already has been
brought to a standstill.
Austrians Sink Ships.
BE3R1LJN, July 11. (Via wireless to
Sayville, L. I.)—At least four and
possibly five armored British patrol
boats were destroyed by the Aus
trian cruiser Novara In an engage
ment off Otranto road, the Austrian
admiralty announced in an official
statement received here today.
"At dawn our cruiser Novara, off
Otranto road, meta group of four, or
according to the declarations of pris
oners, five armored British patrol
boats," said the official statement.
"A11 the patrol boats were destroy
ed by our fire. All sank, three burn
ing after boiler explosions. Of the
crews, the Novara could rescue only
nine British sailors."
The Strait of Otranto, where the
naval engagement occurred, con
nects the Adriatic and Ionian seas.
It lies between the southeastern
coast of Italy and the coast of A1-.

ROME. July 11.—Kaiser Wllhelm

This information was received from
Geneva today.
A delegation of Austro-German mili
tary and diplomatic officials arived at
Sofia Sunday, carrying the request.
They pointed out to the Bulgarian
ruler that continued succeses for the

Czar Ferdinand replie.i that the
withdrawal of Bulgarian troops for
service in Galicia or on the Italian
front would invite an immediate at
tack by the allies from Salonika.
He promised, however, to submit the
appeal to the Bulgarian general staff.
The steady advance of the Russians
