Occupy Hill Known as No. 97 Commanding the Somme
and Have Strengthened Positions
GERMANS FINALLY PENETRATE TRONES WOOD
After Five Desperate Attacks Were Repulsed by British, the
Sixth Succeeded British Win Ground in Mametz Wood

position Austro-Italian Fighting Goes On With Vigor
British Success in German East Africa.
The French in their operations south
of the Somme have advanced to with
in a mil? of Perrone. at present held
strongly by the Germans. They have
occupied the summit known as Hill 97,
which commands the Somme to the
southeast of Biaches and have
strengthened their positions between
Biaches and Barleux.
Germans Penetrate Trones Wood.
Desperate fighting has occurred be
tween the British and the Germans
at Trones Wood, against which the
Germans launched six separate attacks.
Five of these were repulsed, according
to the British war office, but the sixth
was successful in that it permitted
the Germans to penetrate the wood,
where latest reports said the fighting
continued.
British Break Stubborn Resistance.
The British troops, however, made
some gains in the neighborhood of
Ovillers and La Boisselie, and in a
particularly powerful attack en the
German positions in the Mametz
,Vood succeeded in winning some
ground, where previously the resist
ance had been too strong to break,
i The forces of the German Crown
Prince are still poinding heavily
against the French positions at Froide
Terre, Fleury and the Furain wood, in
the Verdun sector, but so far as the of
ficial statements show, the actions
have been cor..'h cd to bombardments.
No Hat lr . n.si.n Advance.
There has apparently been no halt
of the Russian advance towards Ko
vel in Vclhynia. The German , de
fenses along the Stokhod River have
been unable to stay the progress of
the Russians who, though strongly op
posed, have crossed the river at vari
ous points. The latest communication
from Russian feneral headquarters
ehows that the two opposing armies
are in the midst of a terriHic strug
gle, for it mentions that "the enemy
rallied and made desperate efforts to
maintain his positions on the left bank
of the river."
Along this line the battle is still in
progress.
In the Dvina sector and east of Ba
ranovichi the Germans have delivered
Btrong counter-attacks and are under
taking extensive offensive operations.
Sharp Fighting On Italian Front.
The fighting between the Italians and
Austrians continues with unabated
fury, the Austrian official statement
describing the repulse of Alpine forces
between the Brenta and the Etseh riv
ers, more than 800 Italian dead being
left before the Austrian trenches.
British Forces in East Africa.
British forces under General Smuts
have occupied Tango, the second port
in importance on the coast of German
East Africa and the terminus of a
German railroad.
FRENCH TOOK BIACHES
IN HOUR AND HALF
Every House a Fort But Speedily De
molished by Artillery.
Paris, July 10. The taking by the
French of the Biaches village, on the
bank of the Somme opposite Ste Rad
egonde ,the pricipal suburb of Per
rone, was accomplished in about an
hour and a half. A French lieuten
ant who took part in the assualt, des
cribes the action as follows:
"About noon word came for the di
visions to "keep ready'' and at one
o'clock our soldiers advanced to the
attack all along the front from Sor-
The first German line was passed al
mont Farm to Belloy-enSanterre.
most without fighting, so effective had
the preparatory bombardment been
but when we entered Biaches at ten
minutes after two we found every
hons organized as a fort and supplied
with a number of machine guns. Our
artillery, however, by its accuracy and
power, destroyed these defences, though
it still left cellars and caves full of
enemies.
"As we entered the village, the com
mandant, who was at the head of a
battalion with rifle in hand, orderer
the trumpeters to soud the charge.
All the Germans in the village were
captured or killed. The commandant
was wounded by a shot from a lieu
tenant's revolver. but he knocked
down the lieutenant with a blow from
his rifle.
"At 2:35 the village was completely
in our possession, although a recent
German order had declared it to be
'impreenabie'. We are now less than
two kilometres from Perrone."
Opening Phase of Joffre's Plan.
The recent fighting on the French
front in the Somme sector is only the
opening phase of a plan elaborated by
General Joffre, according to a review
of the military situation published in
today's Temps.
! The paper says that all the results
expected have been accomplished and
that further successes are assured.
"Everybody will realize," says the
Temps, "the danger of making known
in the newspapers the plan which is
being executed by General Joffre. It
must be understood that the opera
tions cannot be carried out in a rigid
and invariable form. Napoleon h!m
helf never entertained such ideas. His
plans were dominated by one chief
purpose and were in a state of con
tinuous evolution. He modified them
after observing the movements of the
' enemy.
"Our operations have begun and be-
igun well and it Is unnecessary to seek
to foretell what will follow. On the
immense front where the forces are in
contact with the enemy the develop
ments will be evolutionary. Without
putting aside his main purpose the
French commander may modify his
first intentions."
HEAVY FIGHTING
ON BOTH FRONTS
Steady Pressure, Not Brilliant Ad
vances, to Be Awaited.
London, July 10, 10.35 p. m. On
both eastern and western fronts heavy
fighting persists. This is especially
the case on the western front where
the struggle is not without fluctua
tions of fortune and brings to mind
the warnings of the correspondents
from the opening of the Somme battle
that steady, methodical pressure, ra
ther than brilliant advances, must be
expected.
The British official statement to
night says that the Germans have en
tered Trones Wood and records fur
ther progress east of Ovillers and La
Boisselie, In addition to a footing se
cured by the British in the Mametz
Wood, where heretofore the Germans
had resisted all the British efforts.
The German official communication
admits French possession of Biaches,
only a short distance from Peronne,
which town is thus seriously exposed
jlihI u,'catei;eu.
On the eastern front the Russians
have crossed the Stokhod river at
many points.
German war correspondents are al
ready claiming that the allied offen
sive has been brought to a stand
still. The correspondent of the Ber
lin Tageblatt with the Austrian, ar
my, testifies to the inexhaustible sup
ply of Russian troops, the great effi
ciency of the Russian artillery and
cavalry and tho endless supplies of
ammunition, as in great contrast to
the condition of the Russian forces
last year.
The Germans are continuing their
strong attacks along the Russian
front, but the view is held here that
this is only with the object of gain
ing time to perfect the defenses of
Kovel and Vladimir-Volynski and to
remove large stores of military ma
terial from these points to Brest- Li
tovsk and Ivangorod.
GERMAN WRITERS CLAIM
OFFENSIVE AT STANDSTILL
Say Great West Front Drive Has
Achieved No Important Result.
Berlin, via London, July 10, 8.09 p.
m. German correspondents on the
west front, telegraphing Sundav, agree
in reporting that the great offensive
is virtually at a standstill. They al
so assert that it achieved no results
of practical importance in the week it
lasted and that what gains were
made were quite out of proportion to
the losses suffered.
The correspondent of the Lokal An
zeR'er telegraphs:
"The offensive has been at a stand
still for the last three davs and is
shattering itself into a bitter group
of conflicts on the wall cf our sec
ond lines. Our defending forces have
dammed up the advancing enemy in a
basin and they are unable to unite
forces sufficient to enlarge the borders
of the basin to any extent worth not
ing." The correspondent of the Vossische
Zeitung reports that the first week of
:- offensive "has not brought the
-iv nearer his goal." He intimates
t, possibility of an extension of the
:.:li,s' efforts.
"All kinds of signs point to the
possibility of au extension of the
front on which the offensive is taking
place. Demonstrations by the allies
continue at La Bassee, Lens, on the
Aisne and in the Bois de Prete. Places
far behind our front are being bom
barded and squadrons of aviators as
cend to disturb our transports and
rear communications. The success of
all these efforts is very scantv."
NC MORE SMALL POX
IN CONNECTICUT TROOPS
Quarantine Can Be Lifted in a Day
or Two.
i
New Haven, Conn.. July 10. A mes
sage to The Associated Press from
Major George E. Hall, commanding

pox in addition to "the single mild
case of small pox which developed in
Company H," While the command was

that no other members of the com
mand have been infected. All indi
cations, the message says, point to the
lifting of the quarantine by Wednes
day or Thursday of the present week.
The general health of the quarantine
camp, the message adds, is above the
average.

ENLISTING BAND
FOR TENTH ARTILLERY
Will be Only Mounted Musical Unit
.. From New England.
Bridgeport, Conn., July 10. Chief
Trumpeter A. S. Lee of New Haven is
in this city, detailed by Col. R. M.
Danford to enlist a band for Tenth
Connecticut Field Artillery, to accom
pany that organization to the border.
He reported today that he has already
secured direct promises of enlistment
from twenty musicians here and
would need only eight more to com
plete his work.
Trumpeter Lee has obtained these
promises (not yet actual enlistments)
from members of the Olympic band
of this city. The only thing that is
holding some of the men back is the
question of pay. In federal service
musicians get $24 a month and sev
eral of the prospective recruits have
families for whom they want to pro
vide in the event that they go to
Mexico. Trumpeter Lee is now add
ing to his work by trying to start a
local fund to care for the families.
The band, whea finally enlisted, will
be the only mounted musical unit
from New England.
49,C0O BELOW WAR STRENGTH.
Only 43,000 at Front and 41,000 in the
Camps After 22 Days.
New York, July 10. Genera! Leon
ard Wood, commander of the depart
ment of the east, announced today
that after three weeks and a day since
President Wilson's orders for the mo
bilisation of the national guard, only
43,000 men have been sent to the
front out of a possible 130,000 in his
command of twenty-two states and
the District of Columbia. This means,
he declared, that there are 90,000 men
yet to be sent to the front.
General Leonard Wood asserted
that there are now in camp about 41,
000 men and that the difference be
tween 41,000 men and 90.000, which
would be the full war strength of the
commands, are yet to be enlisted and
enrolled in the federal service.
General Wood denied that, in an ad
dress before the convention of the Na
tional Education association, he
criticized the officers and men of the
national guard for delay in "springing
to arms.''
By "a rather heavy sprine to arms,"
the general added, he meant to con
vey the impression that it required
an unusually long time to mobilize
even a small number of the guard.
"My criticism," said the general,
"was not of the officers and men. but
of the system. It was intended to
point out the necessity for prepared
ness and indicate how fatally slow
would be this kind of mobilization in
a serious emergency."
General Wood announced that troop
movements from now on would be
slow. Weeks may be required before
certain commands in the south will
be able to move.
General Wood will leave tomorrow
for the Plattsburgh military training
camps, where he expects to remain
until Friday.
Restrictions to Be Lowered.
The general announced that the re
strictions for membership for the last
two camps, those beginning Auerust 4
an September 18, would be waived.
Membership will be open to all cit
izens between the ages of 18 and 55,
in good health and willing to defray
their own expenses.
The suspension of the stringent en
trance requirements to the camp will
it is expected, increase the total mem
bership to 20,000 for the summer.

Permanent Peace
Wilson's Wish
DEFENDED DEMOCRATIC PARTY
AS FRIEND OF BUSINESS.
ADDRESSES SALESMEN
Democrats Are as Much Interested in
Prosperity of Country as Anyone
Else President Lauds Federal Re
serve Act.
Detroit, Mich., July 10. President
Wilson urged peace reached by mutual
understanding rather than force and
defended the democratic party as a
friend of business in speeches today to
enthusiastic Michigan audiences. De
troit streets were lined with thousands
if persons who shouted greetings and
vaved American tiags at him where
ver he appeared, the hall in which he
spoke to the World's Salesmanship
Congress was jammed, an audience
estimated at 50,04)0 greeted him at the
Ford motor plant and tonight in To
ledo another throng listened to his
brief rear platform address.
Salesmen Shouted "Peace."
"Peace," was the shouted response
of the salesmanship audience when the
president asked them what they desir
ed when the present war struggles are
at an end. And he added that "per
manent peace" was his desire.
At a non-partisan luncheon in the
Detroit Athletic Club, the president
sprang to the defence of the democrats.
A prominent republican had told him
during the day that he had been de.
riving pleasure from association with
democrats and the executive recited
the incident and declared that he long
had enjoyed the friendship and com
panionship of republicans .because be
ing a teacher, "he would like to teach
them something."
All In the Same Boat.
"We have been trying, some of us,
for a good many years, to teach in
politics, as well as elsewhere, this les
son, that we are all in the same boat,"
he said. "We have common interests
and it is our business to understand
and serve those common interests.
The great difficulty that has confront
ed us, gentlemen, has often been that
we have deliberately looked at these
common interests from self-chosen
angles, which made them look as if
some of us were separated from others
and as if some of us wanted to d'e
press business, for example, and oth
ers of us wanted to exalt business. .
The Democracy of Business.
"I dare say that you have noticed
that the same necessity to make a liv
ing is imposed upon democrats as re
publicans and I dare say you are ready
to believe that democrats are just as
willing to make a good living as re
publicans. Therefore it seems to me
logically to follow, though 1 have been
quoted as having no logic, that dem
ocrats are fully as much interested in
the business prosperity of the United
States as anybody else. So that if
you believe that they are not as fit
ted to guide as other persons, that
you can be doubting their interest, you
are only impugning their intelligence."
The suspicion is beginning to dawn,
he added, that the overage man under
stands the business necessities of the
country as well as the extraordinary
man.
Federal Reserve Act Saved Panic.
"So I invite your thoughts," he con
tinued, "in what 1 sincerely believe to
be an entirely non-partisan spirit to
the democracy of business.
An act was recently passed in con
gress that some of the most intelligent
business men of this counry earnest
ly opposed men whom I knew, men
whose character I trusted, men whose
integrity I absolutely believed in. I
refer to the federal reserve act by
which we intended and succeeded, in
taking credit out of the control of
small number of men and making it
available to everybody who had real
commercial assets, and the very men
who opposed that act and opposed
it conscientiously, now admit that it
saved the country from a ruinous panic
that it is the salvation of every aver,
when the stress of war came on and
age business man who is in the midst
of the tides that I hav.e been trying
to describe.
"What does trat mean, gentlman?
It means that you can get a settled
point of view and can conscientiously
oppose progress if you do not need
progress yourself. That is what it
means. I am not impugning the in
telligence even of men who opposed
these things because the same thing
happens to every man if he is not of
extraordinry makeup, but he cannot
see the necessity for a thine that he
does not himself need. When you
have abundant credit and control" of
credit, you, of course, do not need that
the area of credit should be broadened."
TO ADVANCE SALESMANSHIP.
It Doesn't Pay to Hire Unsuccessful
Men, Says Chalmers.
Prominent Americans, speaking to
day at the opening sessions of the
World's Salesmanship Congress, urg
ed the business men of the United
States who seek foreign trade to ad
just their methdls to conform with
the national customs and business
methods of each country they invade.
President Wilson touched upon the
topic in his opening address this fore
noon. D. M. Barrett, general chair
man of the congress; Secretay of
Commerce William C. Redfield, Lafay
ette Young, the Des Moines publish
er, and Hugh Chalmers. Detroit man
ufacturer, preached the same gospel.
"Sell your foreign customers what
they want to buy and serve them as
they want to be served." was the key
note of several addresses made this
afternoon.
Mr. Redfield declared that American
business, attempting to broaden its
foreign field, will face the greatest test
in its history when the European war
is over. Success or failure, he said,
rests with American business' men
and American business methods. Mr.
Chalmers devoted much of his address
to suggestions regarding the hiring of
salesmen.
The automobile maker recommended
that employers have several confer
ences with prospective sales before
hirin gthem. "I do not believe that
as a rule it pays to employ unsuccess
ful men." he said. 'They are, of
course, exceptions to this rule but why
bother with exceptions 7"
First Submarine
One of Fleet
DEUTSCHLAND TO BE FOLLOW
ED BY BREMEN IN 8 WEEKS.
STATUS IS DEFINITE
Only Arms on Board Were Four
Revolvers and a Rifle Ready to
Discharge, Take on New Cargo and
Start Back to Germany.
Baltimore, July 10. The daring Ger
man seamen who brought the submar
ine merchantman Deutschland across
the Atlantic slept quietly tonight
aboard their vessel, which lay moor
ed to a carefully screened pier guard
ed by a strons squad of Baltimore po
lice. Captain Paul Koenig, the skip
per, had delivered his papers to the
North German Llcyd office, entered his
vessel at the custom house as a com
merce carrier and had presented to
a German embassy official a packet of
correspondence for Count von Bern
storff. Only One of a Fleet,
Now the submarine is ready to dis
charge her million dollar crgo of
dyestuffs and take on board for the
return trip to Germany metal and rub
ber needed by the emperor's armies
and navy. The return merchandise is
waiting on the dock and the time for
leaving port will depend largely upon
plans for eluding vigilant enemy cruis
ers expected to 'be waiting outside the
entrance of Chesapeake for the re
appearance of the vessel. One of Cap
tain Koonig's first acts after he moved
his ship up the harbor from quaratine
today was to announce that the
Deutschland was but one of a fleet of
mammoth submersibles built for a reg
ular trans-Atlantic mail service. He
said the next to come would be the
Bremen and that she might be look
ed for some port along the coast with
in eight weeks.
Anxious to establish promptly his
peaceful character and to forestall m
vestigation sought by diplomatic rep
resenlai ives of the allied powers, the
German captain submitted his craft to
a thorough inspection by the surveyor
of the port and an agent of the de
parimeni of justice. These officers, as
well as the customs inspectors and
quarantine surgeons, agreed that there
was no sign of armament of any des
cription on board and that there was
no doubt in their minds about the
boat being entitled to tho status of an
ordinary merchantman. Guy V. Steele,
lii" surveyor, made a formal reportTfo
this effect to Port Collector Ryan, who
transmitted it to the treasury depart
ment at Washington.
The only arms on board were four
automatic pistols belonging to the of
ficers and a soprtsman's rifle for fir
ing rockets.
Encountered No Allied Ships.
At the office of the North German
Lloyd, Capt. Koenig issued a type
written statement telling of the com
ing of other boats like the Deutsch
land and asserting that his voyage
had broken the British control of the
seas. At the same time he submitted
to an interview in which he described
his 3. SOU-mile cruise from Helgoland
to Chesapeake Bay. He denied re
ports that iie had been chased off his
course by enemy warships, declaring
that so far as he knew tnere was not
an allied warcraft in the Atlantic. The
captain asserted further that the voy
age had established the fact that a
submarine of the type of the Deutsch
land could travel anywhere that the
ordinary vessel could go, 13,0u0 miles,
if necessary. He had no fears, he
stated, of his ability to elude enemies
that might be waiting for him off the
Virginia capes when he starts his re
turn trip.
"I will be able to submerge within
the three-mile limit and they cannot
catch me after that," he said.
On Surface Almost All the Way.
During nearly the entire voyage to
America, said Captain Koenig, the
Deutschland traveled on the surface.
Once she submerged for ten hours
and lay during that time on the bot
tom of the English channel to escape
British destroyers.
SMALL SHARK CAUGHT
IN LONG ISLAND SOUND
It Was Only Three Feet Long, But
Caused a Thrill,
Bridgeport, Conn., July 10. Consid
erable excitement was caused late to
day at the fashionable Black ' Rock
Yacht club and along the beaches to
tho westward when the crew of Wil
son Marshall's yacht Jessica, while
fishing in the sound, brought up a
small shark. The fish caught was
only about three feet in length, but
the fact that a shark really had been
found in the sound sent a chill all
along the shore. Reports of the pres
ence of this kind of southern visitor
are frequent, but the actual presence
of a shark of any kind in Long Is
land sound is very rare.
