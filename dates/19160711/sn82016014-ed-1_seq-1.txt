But State Department Says
Sub a Merchantman.
Washington, July 11. Great Brit
ain and France will do everything in
their power ' to prevent the United
Rtates recognizing the super-submarine
Deutschland as a ship of com
merce, and to prevent the operation of
a line of mibmarine freighters pro
posed bv the North German Lloyd
Steamship company. This wan admit
ted at the embassies of the two gov
ernments today.
The British embassy today correct
ed published reports that it was not
actively trying to oppose the peaceful
stay of the Deutschland. Any subma
rine, the embassy said. Is potentially a
warship, and any ship at sea would be
unable to determine until too late to
save itself whether a submarine was
armed.
This fact alone would prevent rec
ognition of a submarine as a possible
merchantman, according to the em
bassy's view. These facts, it was
learned, have been pointed out to Act
ing Secretary of State Polk by Coun
sellor Barckley .acting charge of the
embassy.
Questions not only of the Deutsch
land's status as a war ship or a mer
chantman, but as to her cargo and the
cargo she will take back to Germany
with her are to be taken up by the
embassy with the state department.

Acting under an appeal from Dr. S.

equipment and facilities of the state
medical school for use in fighting the
spread of infantile paralysis. Under
the direction of the state board, an in

ducted at the state medical school at
Rosedale.
Doctor Crumbine asked the state
board of administration for use of the
equipment of the state medical school
In a study of methods for the care and
prevention of the disease. At a meet
inf? of the board today the suggestion
was adopted. Dr. A. L. Skoog, pro

With the British Armies in the
Field, July 11 (noon), via London
(3:27 p. m.) After the assault of
last night, the British remain in pos
session of Contalmaison, holding it
against German counter-attacks and
furious shell fire. Fighting continued
through the night from Ovllliers and
l.a Boisselle to Trones Wood. The
British, bombarding their way for
ward, gained considerably in Mametz
Wood and took all except the point of
the fiercely disputed pear-shaped
Trones Wood, clearing the way with
each step toward the German second
line on the ridges beyond.
The infantry is at such close quar

Officials From Omaha Superin

Water service equipment for the
entire Union Pacific system and store
house supplies for this district are to
be located in Topeka according, to ru
mors following activities of Union Pa
cific officials. Officials in Topeka to
day from Omaha have made.no au
thoritative statements. Late- today,
however, it became known that ar
rangements were being completed for
the location of the new quarters In
the west yards of the Union Pacific.
Under the plan as outlined in To
peka this afternoon the removal of the
water service and storehouse supplies
to this city will mean seventy-five to
100 new families for Topeka. Persons
in the councils of the Union Pacific
today admitted that plans were being
worked out for increased supply serv
ice at this point. In fact it was
authoritatively stated that a portion of
the supplies for the water service is
now being shipped to Topeka.
Erect New Buildings.
A number of new buildings are to
be erected by the Union Pacific in or
der to house the new quarters. It was
stated today that the new quarters
would probably be located in the west
yards, about a mile and a nan west
of the Union Pacific station in North
Topeka. ,
Arrival today of otficiais connected
with the general storekeeper's depart
ment in Omaha gave added credence
to the report that Topeka is to land
the district storehouse. This depart
ment will mean that all railway and
track supplies for this district will be
handled from Topeka. The depart
ment will require the service of prob
ably aixty men.- ,.-."- ,
From Junction City.
Removal of the water system will
mean a loss of service from Junction
City and other Union Pacific points
to Topeka. The plan as outlined by
persons in touch with the plans of the
railroad, today indicated the consoli
dation of the water service for the en
tire Union Pacific system here. This
department will handle the pumping
station, tank and reservoir service for
the system. A similar department or
the Santa Fe railway is maintained In
Topeka.
The program for consolidation of
additional shop service in Topeka is
expected to mean the immediate erec
tion of several new buildings in the
Union Pacific yards. Work on the
new structures and orders for the re
moval of men will be directed from
the offices In Omaha. The plan of
the Union Pacific heads Is said to
mean the immediate erection of build
ings and removal of men to Topeka
this fall.
PEACE FOLLOWS
ALLIES' DEFEAT
Berlin Optimistic on General
Outlook at Somme.
Declare Check Administered to
British Drive. '
BY CARL W. ACKKRMAX.
Berlin July 11. The great allied
offensive will end in defeat within a
few weeks and will be followed by
negotiations for peace in the opinion
of well-informed persons in Berlin.
The check administered to the
British in the death struggle north of
the Somme has given rise to the na
tional hope that peace will follow the
fighting in Picardy, which has been
marked by unprecedented slaughter.
The German people are practically a
unit in believing the attempt of the
allies to force the German line is
doomed to failure.
Except on one narrow sector the
British have been unable to make any
perceptible impression on the German
lines, despite their overwhelming su
periority in men. Impetuous dashes
have frequently carried General Haig's
men into German positions, where
they were immediately cut off and
killed or captured.
Deadlock Not Broken.
The French, more prudent, have
made some progress south of the
Somme but thus far neither French
nor British have developed the pow
erful attack necessary to break com
pletely the deadlock in the west and
roll the Germans out of France and
Flanders. The feeling prevails here
that when the extent of the British
losses becomes fully known in England
coupled with the fact that the Ger
man line still remains intact, public
opinion will demand that peace be
made without further slaus.iter.
German experts are quite certain
that the British will never quit the
attack without first feeling out other
sectors of the German front in the
hope of finding an opening. But they
are confident that the British - will
have no greater success against the
strongly fortified lines further north
than they have had between the An
cre and the Somme, Some of the
more optimistic of the German corre
spondents, notably the correspondent
.n wic ironi oi tnt vossische Zeitung.
j believe the allied offensive already has
1 been brought to a standstill.
Here, in pictorial form, are the rules which should be followed in caring for the children during the epidemic of infantile
paralysis. They are the preventive measures recommended by the Health Department and the Rockefeller Institute.

-J iiiiifliMl Ik'-
'Kansas, in 1914 produced the larg
est wheat crop of any state up to the
present time in the history of the
United States, amounting to 180.000,
000 bushels. ' Last year it yielded the
leadership to North Dakota, but has
undoubtedly regained the same with
the second largest crop in the history
of the state with the present crop har
vest which will be finished in a few
days."
This Is a statement made in Topeka
this week by E. M. Jolley, of the
Jolley Grain Co., Kansas City, Mo.,
and one of the best informed grain men
in the west, and who has recently in
terviewed a large number of Kansas
millers and grain dealers, grain grow
ers, bankers and railroad officials, all
of whom are vitally interested and
thoroughly informed of the outcome
of the present Kansas wheat crop.
Quality Is Good.
The total yield," said he "aa in
dicated by the government crop re
port issued July 7, gave Kansas
credit with 110,000,000 bushels. This
estimate was made upon reports be
fore any threshing returns were re
ceived, and the estimate is undoubt
edly 10.000.000 to 20,000,000 bushels
too low, which is largely accounted
for by the exceptionally fine quality
of the matured crop.
"This notwithstanding the fact that
Secretary Mohler's estimate a few
days ago gave Kansas only 90.000,000
bushels of wheat for 1918.

More Than 1,000 Fined for
Sanitary Violations in City.
New York. July 11. Communities
immediately surrounding New York
city show increasing fear that they will
be infected with infantile paralysis
from children fleeing from the plague
in the metropolis. A number of cities
and towns in New Jersey and New
York has established quarantines and
some are turning back all children
from New York city. Paterson. N. J.,
which haa had one d?ath from the
disease has excluded ali children, no
matter from whence they came. It
was announced that 600 children from
New York city have already been de
ported. It is estimated that more than 1.000
persons were fined yesterday for vio
lations of the sanitary code. Most of
the offenders threw garbage into the
street or left garbage cans uncovered
or in other ways broke the rules for
keeping the city clean which now are
being rigidly enforced. The fines
ranged from to $5 and most of
them were paid by persons not able to
afford even these small amounts.
The exodus of children from the un
infected parts of the city continues
and it is estimated that several thou
sand people go each day.
Many parents are keeping their
children in the house, despite the
warning of physicians that such pre
cautions would Injure the child's
health and make him more sus
ceptible to the disease.

Paris, July 11. Twenty-two vil

French armieB since the great of
fensive of the Somme began ten days
ago.
Peronne, lying about a mile across
the Somme from the French advance
lines and the next important prize to
ward which the French are advancing,
lies almost within grasp of General
Foch's army.
Dispatches from headquarters today
showed that the village of Biaches. one
mile from Peronne, was captured by
the French in the same dashing spirit
that drove the enemy out of Dom
pierre, Hardecourt and other strongly
fortified points.
Dompierre with its entire first Ger
man positions, was taken in fifty min
utes and Hardecourt in only thirty
five. The Germans resisted more stub
bornly at Biaches. but within less than
two hours the village and all its strong
defensive fortifications were in the

BIG INCREASE
IN INSANITY
ISJEPORTED
Has Grown 14 Per Cent in
Kansas in a Year.
JTew Patients Admitted to Hos
pitals uniber 772.
A TOTAL OF 4,311 IN STATE
Of These 1,565 Are in the To
peka Hospital.
Men Patients Largely Outnum
ber the Women.
Insanity has increased nearly 14
per cent, in Kansas in the last year.
That was the statement issued today
by Senator J. W. Howe, secretary for
the state board of control. The report
shows admissions of 772 new insane
patients to the hospitals of Topeka,
Osawatomie and Parsons in the last
year as compared with a record of 671
new cases for the year ending June
30. 1915.
The Howe report does not go into
the details of causes. It merely gives
the returns from all of the big char
itable institutions under management
of the board of control. The record
shows a total of 4,311 inmates of the
institutions under the board's man
agement. Of these, 3,016 are in the
Topeka, Osawatomie and Lamed hos
pitals, with 525 in the Parsons hos
pital and 589 in the Winfield hospital.
There were 181 inmates of the state
orphans' home, Atchison, when the re
port was compiled, June 30.
Tile Astonishing Record
One of the really startling features
of the report is the tremendous in
crease in the number of cases of in
sanity. The record of the Topeka state
hospital shows that institution han
dled sixty more new insane patients
than a year ago. The record for Osa
watomie showed a slight decline, while
the report of insane patients received
at Parsons shows an increase of 150
per cent. In the year ending June
30, 1915, the Parsons hospital received
33 new insane patients, while in the
year Just ended the total reached 80.
Reports from the Topeka hospital
show A total of 416 new cases during
the year .lust ended aa against 350 last
year. The year's record at Osawato
mie was 232 new patients as against
288 the previous year. The Parsons
hospital intended originally as an in
stitution for the care of epileptics
received 80 insane patents during the
year, as against 33 the previous year.
Urned's hospital is not a receiving in
stitution at this time. The 118 pa
tients in the new Pawnee county hos
pital were sent from Topeka and Osa
watomie. Increase In Imbecility.
Increase in the number of imbeciles
received at Winfield showed an even
greater record than the increase in in
sanity. The increase for Winfield
during the year was slightly more than
50 per cent. In the year just ended,
Winfield received 120 new cases as
against 79 the previous twelve months.
In all institutions except Osawato
mie the number of new male patients
greatly exceeded females. Topeka
hospital received 248 male patients
port shows 1,565 patients in the To
males. Parsons received 55 miles and
25 females. Winfield's record was 85
males and 35 females. At Osawato
mie 132 males and 150 females were
received. The total for the institutions
during the year was 520 males and 372
females.
"The increase in the number of new
patients is unusual," said Secretary
Howe. "I do not attempt to assign a
cause. At Winfield, of course, the in
crease may be explained through the
completion of a new hospital building
vhich afforded facilities for the care
of more patients"
Topeka State hospital is far in the
lead of other state Institutions in the
number of patients treated. The re
port shows 11,565 patients in the To
peka hospital as against 1,348 at Osa
watomie, 113 at Lamed, 525 at Par
Bons, 589 at Winfield and 181 in the
Atchison orphans' home.
The report shows 110 patients In
the Topeka and Osawatomie hospitals
were discharged as restored.
CROPS BETTER HERE
Kansas Shows 7.2 Per Cent Better
Condition During Last Month.
Washington, July 11. The compos
ite condition of all crops of the United
States on July 1 was about 1.6 per cent
above their ten-year average condi
tion on that date, as compared with a
condition 2.3 per cent below average
on June 1, indicating some improve
ment in crop prospects during the past
month. Final yields per acre of crops
last year were about 7.4 per cent above
average. This year total acreage in
cultivated crops is slightly less than
last year.
The condition of Kansas crops was
placed at 106.2 per cent, a gain of 7.2
per cent over June.
The level of prices paid producers
of the United States for the
crops decreased about 0.7 per cent
during June; in the past eight years
the price level decreased about 0.5
per cent during June. On July 1 the
index figure of prices was about 4.1
per cent higher than a year ago, 5.2
per cent higher than two years ago,
and 4.0 per cent higher than the av
erage of the past eight years on July 1.
The prices of meat animals hogs,
cattle, sheep and chickens to produc
ers of the United States increased
6.2 per cent from May 15 to June 15;
in the past six years prices decreased
in like period 0.5 per cent. On June
15 the index figure of prices for these
meat animals was about 16.7 per cent
higher than a year ago, 10.7 per cent
higher than two years ago, and 19.2
the past six years on June 15.

LAUGH IS ON SIMON
If Lake Had Patent Why IMdn't He
Build Ships Like Deutschland?
BY CARL W. ACKERMAN.
Berlin, via wireless to Sayville, July
11. Every Berlin newspaper today
devoted a large part of its news col
umns to the arrival of the submarine
Deutschland at Baltimore and its edi
torial columns to praising the sub
marine's crew.
The Vossische Zeitung said that sev
eral similar ships are being construct
ed to begin commercial relations with
neutral countries thereby breaking the
British blockade.
One of the ships is named the
Bremen. All are of about 2,000 tons.
The Deutschland was built at Kiel,
work being started on her shortly
after a company was formed, Nov. S,
1915.
German ship builders are laughing
at Simon Lake's threat to bring suit
against the Deutschland's owners for
patent infringements.
"Was it Lake or Jules Verne who
discovered the submarine?" asked one
shipping man. "If Lake had the pat
ent, why didn't he build submarines
like the Deutschland?"
