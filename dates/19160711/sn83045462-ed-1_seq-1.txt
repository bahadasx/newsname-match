and in repelling German counter attacks,
which are directed particularly
against the British to the north of the

other points, however, the British hsve
been able to mak'e some progress, although
necessarily slow, against well i
fortified positions. \
The Germans, on their part, are heavily
shelling the allied front from Lens ,

Carranza Told Secretary
Lansing's Absence Is No

to Negotiations. ^
A
TO AGREE TO ANY PLAN
ASSURING QUICK ACTION
Reports of American Sailors Being
Killed at Tampico Denied by
State and Navy Departments.
Gen. Carranza has been notified
that negotiations for the settlement
of the border difficulties
need not await the return of Secretary
Lansing from his vacation.
It is expected here that Carranza
will propose a formal joint conference,
rather than informal conversations
between Ambassador
Arredondo and the State Department.
American officials will accede
to any plan which assures
quick action.
War Department officials had no reports
upon and discounted rumors of a
revolt in the Carranza garrison at Chihuahua
city. The Mexican embassy issued
a formal denial of the report.
Attack on Sailors Denied.
Reports credited to American refugees
that two American sailors were
killed recently at Tampico when their
launch was flred upon by Carranza soldiers
were denied by the State and
Navy departments. Officials said the
story was based upon an incident at
Tampico June 25 or 26, when Carranza
soldiers flred upon a privately owned
American tug and no one was hurt.
Acting Secretary Polk, in the absence
of Secretary Lansing, attended the
cabinet meeting today and reported on
the informal conversations he has had
with Mr. Arredondo.
The Villa bandits who attacked the
Carranza garrison at Jiminez arid Corralitos
last week were reported today,
in dispatches to the Mexican embassy
here, to have separated into two divisions,
one going northward toward
the Texas border and the other pushing
across Chihuahua into Durango state.
Troops Follow the Bandits.
ranza consul at El Paso, said that
troops of the de facto government in
sufficient numbers to destroy the bandits
had followed them in close pursuit.
Border reports that the Carranza garrison
at Santa Rosalia had revolted and
{oined forces With the bandits were
denied by Consul Garcia. He described
the band that attacked Jiminez and
Corralitos as poorly armed and composed
in its majority of gangs, which
had been marauding, in Durango and
the Laguna district and which recently
had concentrated at Las Nieves.

BALTIMORE, Md? July n.?
The work of unloading the cargo
of the Deutschland began shortly
after 9 o'clock. The cases of dyestuffs
were stored inside the
warehouse at the base of the pier.
A question has arisen whether;
the submarine will be permitted j
to take back to Germany a large j

Shipment of nickel to the United
States from Canada, which is the
world's greatest producer of this
metal, has been allowed on condition
that its distribution should
be so controlled that none could
reach the central powers. The
Canadian government is said to
be considering the new situation.
No Objection to Examination.
There will be no objection on the
part of Capt. Paul Koenig. commander
of the German submarine Deutschland.
to an inspection of his craft by officers
of the I'nited States Navy. This was
announced by Capt. Koenig today after
the arrival from Washington of Capt.
C. F. Hughes and two of the navy's
submarine experts, assigned to aid the
collector of the port in determining
the status of the vessel.
The detail was made at the instance !
of Acting Secretary of State Polk, and
is understood to be in line with official
opinion that the federal government
must take every precaution to establish
beyond doubt the exact chac* er
of the vessel.
Officers Inspect Deutschland.
American navy officers detailed by
the Navy Department to determine the
status of the German submarine
Deutschland went aboard the craft today.
Capt. Paul Koenig, commander of
the Deutschland, was not there to receive
them, but they were shown
through the vessel by the marine superintendent
of the North German
L?lovd line with her commander's permission.
The officers, accompanied by the collector
of the port, boarded the Deutsch- i
land at her pier from a tug. Officially !
they were to determine whether, the J
submarine was an armed vessel, but !
they were given permission by Capt.
Koenig to make a complete inspection.
This meant that the American navy
officers had been .given the privilege of
learning all the secrets, if any. of the
vessels construction, although ('apt.
Koenig said today that there was nothing
in this respect to conceal. The
navy officers expected, after completing
their inspection, to return to Washington
to report to the Navy Department.
Capt. Koenig today made a statement
to the customs officials that he expected
to get away within ten days- He
had been told that if he remained longer
than two weeks the Deutschland's
wireless would be sealed up.
Will Carrv No Passencers.
? .
An emphatic statement was made b%
Henry G. Hilken of the firm which
represents the Deutschland's owners
that under no circumstances will any
passengers be carried on the submarine
on her return trip. He said provision
u as made only for the crew, and
that it would be impossible to take any
others. '1 wo applicants for passage are
said to have offered each. Mr.
Hilken smilingly said he expected the
submarine to leave "about Christmas,"
but it is understood she will depart
within a week.
The Deutschland is moored within a
quarter of a mile of the place where
the first submergence was made, nineteen
years ago, of the first boat to
navigate under water successfully.
This was the Argonaut, invented by
Simon Cake, who came to Baltimore
yesterday to congratulate personally
Capt. Koenig 'of the Deutschland on
the ieat he had accomplished.
Devices for Detecting- Ships.
After completing the formalities with
the port authorities yesterday, Capt.
Koenig was invited to luncheon as the
guest of honor of the German club and
there delivered to Haniel von Haimhausen.
counsellor of the German embassy,
the packet of official correspondence
destined to Count von Bernstorff.
The counselor had journeyed here from
New York. was a guest with the
Deutschland's master at the luncheon
and went back to New York last night,
Capt. Koenig was asked to explain
what devices me ueuiacmaiiu n?u ior j
finding her way under water and i
avoiding: danger. j
"We have two," he said. "One is the j
microphone, the other a sounding apparatus.
With the microphone you can i
hear submarine bell buoys six miles
away and the propellers of ships still !
further. By the tone of the noise made;
by the screw of a vessel you can tel!
her type. A destroyer makes a loud
hum, a cruiser's is lower.
"The sounding apparatus can be
worked while we are running submerged
and is let down through the
bottom of the boat through a tube
equipped with valves. In this submarine
we can do everything under the surface
that we can do on it We can drop
anchor while submerged, cruise below
the surface four days if necessary, or
lie still on the bottom until our food
and water give out. And you can believe
me that we can carry a large
guaranty of both."
('apt. Koenig was asked how he and
his men employed their time while
making the voyage.
"Well," said he, "we had phonographs.
They were a' source of much entertainment.
We had about 100 records. There
were some American ragtim^ songs,
some inarches and gome dances. Selecfbontiawti

In their preparatory bombardment 1

on this front. The Germans answered
the British shelling with an immense

scattering shells near the front line.

French spirit. While France was
withstanding the blows of the Germans
at Verdun and all the world
looked in that direction he was secretly
preparing a sledge hammer blow
in conjunction with the British in that
part of the line hitherto conspicuous
for its quiet.
"We were here and we went there,
gaining more prisoners than our total I
losses." he said as. turning to a map
on the wall in the sitting room of the
chateau which serves as his headouar
ters, he swept his finger from the former
French first line toward the salient
formed by a turn in the Somme, where
the tlermans have their backs to the
river in front of Peronne. The gesture
represented a depth of four miles, the
largest gain the French have made on
the western front since the trench
warfare began.
"Ard there is more to come," he
added.
A note from his chief of staff, thanks
to a note from British headquarters,
meant the freedom of the lines, which
by the elation on the features of every
man whom the correspondent saw, was
in winning mood. It was an army of
movement, an army stretching its
legs and its imagination, which had
taken to the road in advance.
Tractors Draw Big Guns.
Big guns which were silent and
other big guns, slowly grumbling,
were drawn forward by big tractors
along routes thick with traffic. Making
many turns in trying to compass
something of the whole, the correj
spondent's car proceeded, occasionally
(having an interval of a few hundred
j yards of clear way, to make up for
the time lost when blocked by a glut
of transport.
Railway trains were unloading more
shells at the bases; shells were being
stacked beside the roads and in the
fields; new roads were building; Jlnea
of light railway were being extended.
There was the same scene of prodigious
industry as back of Verdun, but
this time, instead of being on the defensive,
it was overflowing *on ground

"Are we downhearted?" No!" called
I a soldier in good English.
I Passing officers ann men exchanged
1 joyful congratulations. No one seemed

i or how unshaven, so long as he had

Some four or Ave hundred prisoners
taken the previous night and waiting
to be marched to the railroad station
were human lumps of utter exhaustion
asleep on the ground. All expressed
the same astonishment that the French
should develop such .a sudden and determined
attack in that quarter. They
had understood that only the British
were to attack.

Parked nearby were thirty-three
guns, all taken by the Colonial Corps,
which had already put its name and
the date of the capture on the trophies.
One must have* been a piece of honor,
for it bore the German emperor's monogram.

Across the battered first-line trenches

up to the new front.
The country is flat, preventing as many
observation posts and commanding redoubts
as where the British attacked

a start.
In the distance around Flaucourt. the
seventy-flve batteries could be seen flashing
their messages to the Germans beyond.
With their rapid-fire they had
covered the charge of infantry up to
every German parapet. Then right into
the open, in the wake of the infantry,
they advanced to cover the attack on the
second line, which was taken before
nightfall. For every mile of front where
they advanced the French took 1,200 pris

THE RIGHTOF WAY
To Come Up After Three Important
Appropriation Measures
Are Disposed Of.
The shipping bill and Senator Owen's
corrupt practices bill were given the
right of way in a new legislative program
mapped out today by the democratic
steering committee of the Senate
and they will be taken up as soon
as the three important appropriation
bills are disposed of. The California
oil leasing bill will go over and be
called up on the second Monday in
December.
After deciding to postpone action also
on all pending conservation bills until
December, the steering committee determined
upon nine hour daily sessions
from 11 in the morning until 8
o'clock at night beginning today. The
fate of the immigration bill was undecided,
being made the subject of a
special conference to be held tomorrow.
While the democratic steering committee
wa? in session, republicans of
the Senate held a legislative conference,
referring the administration revenue
Dill to the minority members of
the finance committee and the shipping
bill to minority members of the commerce
committee to report at another
conference to be held in the near future.
Republicans Will Co-Operate.
As an indication that the republicans
wish to co-operate in so far as it is
possible to do so with the democrats
in order to expedite the business of the
session, a special committee was appointed
to confer with the democratic
steering committee on the legislative
program. On the committee are Senators
Gallinger, Clark (Wyoming),
Townsend, Cummins and Harding.
"We want to see just where we are
regarding the legislative program,"
said Senator Gallinger, "and to learn
whether we must make up our minds
to stay here until Christmas or get
ready to go home.
"It is the purpose of the republicans
to oppose very vigorously the government
ownership and operation feature
of the shipping bill, and we also shall
oppose the revenue bill on the ground
that government revenues should be
ra4s*d from <*ur imports. We shall endeavor
to Impress that upon the minds

How Infantile Paralysis Can

"KEEP HOUSES CLEAN
AND SWAT THE FLY"
Washingtonians Urged Alto to Bitcourage
Visitors From New York,
Especially Children Under 16.
An official proclamation calling
on the people of Washington to
consider immediately precautionary
methods against possible invasion
of the capital by infantile
paralysis was issued today by the
District Commissioners.
Seventeen suggestions designed to
discourage appearance of the disease
here are embodied in the note of warning.
Outstanding among them are that
householders keep their premises scrupulously
clean, keep everlastingly at
' swatting" the fly and discourage visits
from friends or other persons residing
in New York, especially children under
sixteen years of age.
Prepared Aftei*' Conference.
The proclamation was prepared after
conferences between Commissioner
Brownlow and Dr. John L. Norris and
Dr. William (J. irowier 01 me neaun aepartment.
Thousands of copies will be
printed for immediate distribution
throughout the city. The police have
been instructed to leave a copy at every
house.
Dr. Fowler, who directs the contagious
disease service of the health
department, will go to New York
Thursday to attend the conference of
health officials on the infantile paralysis
situation. It is expected that
his return will be followed by the publication
of other precautionary measures
which may be developed by the
conference.
Text of the Proclamation.
The proclamation of the Commissioners
is as follows:
The Commissioners have noted with
grave interest and anxiety the widespread
prevalence of Infantile paralysis
in New York city and its spread to
other cities of the country. While
there are no known cases of this
f isease in the District of Columbia at
he present time, nor does any' cause
for alarm exist here, it is deemed ad- j
visible to issue a note of warning and
advice to the public and with a view
to securing their earnest co-operation
in an effort to prevent the spread of
this disease in this District, should it
make its appearance here. . I
Anterior poliomyelitis, of more commonly
known as infantile paralysis, is
caused by a germ the true nature of
which is not yet definitely known. Observations
have, however, demonstrated
that it is discharged in the excretions
| from the nose, throat and digestive
j tracts of those suffering with it. Injvestigation
has further shown that per
sons apparently in good health ami ordinarily
termed "carriers" harbor the
germ in the nose and throat and are
capable of communicating the infection
to those with whom they come in contact.
Persons in good health are not
as likely to be attacked as are those
whose vitality has been lowered by
sickness or unhygienic surroundings.
Children under sixteen years of age are
more frequently attacked; especially is
this true of those under five years of 1
age. Adult persons are. however, not
altogether imrfmne.
Rules to Prevent Disease.
The following rules are, therefore, issued
for the information and guidance
of the public:
1. Keep yourself and family in as
good physical condition as possible by
avoiding exposure and excesses of all
kinds. Fresh air, good food and rest
are essential to good health.
2. Householders are urged -to keep
their premises clean, and as free as
possible of refuse of all kinds.
3. Do not allow garbage or trash of
any kind to accumulate. If there is
delay on the part of the contractor in
removing garbage or refuse from your
premises, notify at once the street
cleaning department.
4. See that all garbage receptacles
are watertight and supplied with tight
covers to keep out flies and other insects.
5. Have your house well screened
against flies and other insects. Don't
fail to swat the fly wherever and whenever
found.
6. In sweeping the floors allay the
du?t as much as possible by first
sprinkling or by using a damp cloth to
wipe up the floor.
7 T.et all the sunlieht and air nnssi.
ble enter the house.
8. Prevent as far as possible all
overcrowding of the home, especially of
the sleeping apartments.
9. Do not permit your child to visit
