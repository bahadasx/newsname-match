here to-day mustering out of the

amended a few hours after It had
len Issued, permitting Col. Conley
to tako his troops to the border. Lieut.
Col. Phelan will leave for New York

Immediately nfter receiving the
order Col. Conley got In touch with

changed. A.h tho order now Manila
Col. Conley Is to proceed with the
Sixty-ninth to Texas, nnd upon his
arrival there will relinquish his com
mand to the I'nlted States Depart

nates his service with tho regiment.
The greatest emotion wsi evi
denced by some of the officers.
Col. Conley was visibly upset and
said he believed the action due to
"politics or a desire of the renular
army to grab the National Guard."
When the news got ubout all of
thu officers assembled In a body and
tendorcd their resignations to Col.
Conley. For a tlmo It looked ns
though the Sixty-ninth would never
go to Texas. Col. Conley niado a
speech to his officers In which ho
urged ihem to remain with tb'i regi

ninth should never be found wanting.
It took a great deal of reasoning on
the part of Col. Conley to get the
officers to accept his viewpoint. At
tho conclusion of the meeting they
