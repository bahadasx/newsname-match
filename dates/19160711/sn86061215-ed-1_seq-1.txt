Washington, D. C.f July 10-—
The British and French embassies
today officially called the state de»
partmerrt's attention to the arriv
al of the German supersubmarine
Deutschland and asked that this
government assure itself of «the
vessel's character.
This will be done, it was an
nounced, by the assignment of
naval experts to assist the treas
ury department.
Baltimore, July 10.—Guy V.
8teele, surveyor of the port of
Baltimore, made an official report
to Collector Ryan late today ad
vising that the Deutschland was
an unarmed merchant vessel, en
titled to all the privileges of any
other peaceful ship sailing under
the flag of a friendly nation.
Baltimore, Md., July 10.—Upon
delivering his ship's papers to the
office of the North German-Lloyd
line today, Capt. Paul Konig of the
submarine merchantman Deutsch.
{and issued a formal statement de
claring his voyage across the At
lantic had broken England's rule
of the seas.
The statement, typewritten on
the stationery of the Deutsche
Ozean-Rhederei G. M. B. H., Ber
lin, announced that the Deutsch
land was the first of several sub
marines built for the transatlan
tic trade and that she would be
followed by the "Bremen."
From the custom house Capt.
Konig returned to his vessel, join
ing his crew In the cramped quar
ters in which they have lived for
more than three weeks. So far
no arrangement has been made
for either officers or men to live
ashore while the submarine is
preparing for her return voyage
home.
Baltimore, Md., July 10.—Definite
announcement that the great German
submarine merchantman, Deutsch
land, which reached Chesapeake bay
yesterday, is the flrdt of a fleet of
iuch craft built to ply regularly in
the trans-Atlantic trade was made
herg early today by Capt. Paul Konig,
master of the supersubmarine.
"This is not the only one that is
coming," said the captain. "Just
wait. There will be more here soon
and we are going back for another
cargo. We are going to have a regu
lar line."
It was to port officials that the cap
tain talked as his vessel was prepar
ing to move up to dock from the low
er harbor, where she dropped anchor
at 11 o'clock last night at the end
of her memorable voyage across the
Atlantic through lanes of vigilant en
emy warships. He spoke freely to the
officers and laughed over his feat. To
newspaper men shouting questions
over the ship's side he was not so
communicative, explaining that a for
mal statement would be issued later
by the representatives of his owners.
Close Guard Kept.
All during the night a considerable
part of the Deutschland's crew had
been astir and a small searchlight
played almost constantly upon a news
paper yacht anchored nearby. The
tug Thomas F. Timmons, convoying
the submarine, also kept the yacht

WAR NECESSITIES
E
GERMAN
CARRY
8UBMARINE WILL
BACK RUBBER AND
NICKEL 18 GENERAL BELIEF.
Washington, D. C., July 10.—The
fact that boarding officers found the
German merchant submarine Deutsch
land wholly unarmed goes far toward
simplifying any question aa to her
statws as a merchant ship in Ameri
can waters.
Officials realise, however, that the
British and French embassies, while
Interested little in what the Deutsch
land has brought over, are concerned
over the cargo of rubber and nickel
she proposes to carry back to Ger
many and expect that nothing will be
left undone by Germany's enemies ta
prevent or hinder her clearance.
Although the fact that the submer
sible is unarmed Is of first import
ance, such factors as the composition
of the crew and actual ownership will
have to be established to determine
whether the submarine could be class
ed as a naval auxiliary.
Naval officers pointed out that if a
successful means of running a block
ade had been perfected, one of the
most potent measure of warfare had
become a thing of the past.
Until the customs officials' report Is
received, Acting Secretary Polk said
today that no action was contemplat
ed by the state department. He said
that for the time being at least, de
tails of inspection of the submarine
were within the ju-risdiction of the
treasury department, aided possibly
by the navy department.
Baltimore, Md., July 10. —Capt. Ko
nig's own story of the Deutschland's
voyage was told to newspaper men to
day. He laughed at stories of his being
chased far off his course by enemy
vessels and declared that during the
entire trip the vessel traveled sub
merged only about ninety miles.
"We came to Hampton Roads by the
straight course from the English chan
nel," said the captain. "We did not
come by way of the Azores. Altogeth
er from Helgoland to Baltimore we
covered 3,800 miles. Of that distance,
ninety miles was driven under the sur
face of the water.
"Throughout the trip the officers and
crew were in excellent health and
spirits. Of course, when we were un
der water for long spells, the air got
very stuffy sometimes but It never was
serious. The Deutschland is built to
stay under water for four consecutive
days, so you see we never reached any
where near our submersion limit on
this voyage.
"The ship is much easier to ride in
than a torpedo boat destroyer much
steadier. Nothing can happen to her
she is so perfectly built.
The German commander talked with
the smiling enthusiasm oi a child and
his eyes glittered.
Crew Is Drilled.
"There is little to tell of the trip,"
he continued. "We left Helgoland on
point. I had never been on a submar
ine voyage.
"Everything went without Incident
the first day but on' the second day In
the North sea we were in the zone of
the Britfsh cruisers and destroyers.
We sighted their smoke frequently bflt
only dived when we thought there was
danger of our being detected. Of
course, we were difficult to see because
we were running so low and our ship
gave out no smoke. We did submerge
several times in the North Sea, staying
under sometimes two hours and some
times less. Every time we came to
the surface if all looked well we kept
on going. We saw no British battle
ships in the North Sea, only cruisers
and destroyers or at least what we
took to be British naval vessels.
Avoided War Ships.
"We did not on the entire trip come
into close proximity with any man of
war. We avoided them all. It was
very simple.
"From the North sea we went
straight through the English channel
which is alive with warships and on
the night of the fourth day we sub
merged and remained still all night on
the ground on the bottom of the chan
nel.
There were lots of cruisers near us

WAR SUMMARY.
The French are again on t^ie offen
sive south of the Somme and have
captured German trenches over a dis
tance of two and a half miles east of
Flaucourt and to a depth of about a
mile.
The new French offensive is in con
nection with the British, who have
been engaged in desperate fighting in
the vicinity of Ovillers where, the
British war office says, they have
made "steady progress in the face of
stubborn opposition by the Germans."
Regarding operations around Trones
woods, German headquarters, while
admitting loss of ground in the Harde
court village, says both British and
French were repulsed with
losses at other points.
Losses on all sides are said to be
very large. The British casualty list
of the last four days reports 628
Bri*ish officers killed, wounded or
missing.
The great Russian offensive on the
eastern front is sweeping on with in
creased vigor. The Russians have
crossed the Stokhod river in their

At least two of the country roads

Just what two these will be is not

One car load of the oil has been or-,

A member of the committee today

very likely go without it and other
roads be substituted, even though they

"We just will not oil a road where

WIL80N DELIVERS SPEECH IN
WHICH HE SAYS HE INTENDS
TO SERVE MEXICO.
Detroit, Mich., July 10. —President
Wilson aroused great enthusiasm at
the World's Salesmanship congress to
day by urging that business men carry
justice and fair dealing Into the ports
of the world, particularly those of
Mexico, and thereby establish confi
dence in American principles. His ef
forts, he declared, will be to serve all
America by serving Mexico herself
for her best interests without using
fdrce and not to serve the few "gentle
men" who wish to exploit Mexican
possessions.
When the president asked the crowd
what It desired at the end of all the
present world troubles, It shouted
"Peace'' in one voice and then he add
ed that his wish was "Permanent
peace."
"I hear some men say," he said,
"that they want to help Mexico and
the way they propose to help her is
to overwhelm her with force. That is
the wrong way as well as the long way.
"After fighting them you would have
a nation full of justified suspicion.
What makes Mexico suspicious is that
she thinks we do not want to serve
but possess her. And she has justifica
tion for these suspicions in the way
some gentlemen have sought to exploit
her possessions.
"I will not serve these gentlemen but
I will serve all Americans by trying to
serve Mexico herself.
"The way to establish our sovereign
ty is to respect hers."
The president declared that the mer
chant marine, which some are "so slow
in giving us," will be a great help to
the business interests of the United
States.
