which a little further conference will
clear away. The whole situation is
clearing up wonderfully. Despatches
from the border last aight reported
that (ieneral Cm lies had issued an in

to return to Mexico.
Danger of Break Passes. .
In a formal statement tho Mexican
commander declared
"I have received advices from the
