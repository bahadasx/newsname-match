I State department officials today ex
pressed the belief, based on unofficial
information, that the Deutschland
would be declared a peaceful nnarmed
merchantman and entitled to all privi
leges of an ordinary cargo carrier. Act
ing Secretary Pope said he expected no
protest from the allies governments
against such a decision.
The state department, it was de
ciared, will not concern itself with re
S ported objections of Canadian nickel
interests .to exportation of nickel on

ican purchasers of Canadian nickel nc-t
to re-export the metal. Acting Secrs

privilege and no recourse could be

Before the arrival of tlie boat, acting
upon the basis of reports in the press
that a submarine was due at an Amerl
can port, Colvllle Barclay, the British
counsellor and charge d'affaires in the
•'i temporary absence of Sir Cecil-Rice,
communicated to Secretary Lansing the
position of his government regarding
the' use of any under water craft in
commercial service. M. Jusserand, the
f^enfch ^mbassadoi, also has been .in

Any Submersible a Warship.
The allies' point of view is that any

The United States as well as the British

a merchant ship into a cruiser or pri

Baltimore, July 11,—There will be
no objection on the part of Capt. Paul
Konlg, of the German submarine, to
an inspection of his craft by officers
of the United States navy. This was
announced by Captain Konlg today
after the arrival from Washington of
Capt. C. F. Hughes, and two of- the
navy's submarine experts assigned to
aid the collector of the port In de
terminlng the status of the vessel.
The work of unloading the cargo of
the Deutschland began this mprning.
The cases of dye stuffs were stored in
side the warehouse at the base of the
pier.
Inspectors Proceed to Craft.
Captain Konig had not up to noon
received from the navy officers a 're
quest to be permitted to make the in
spection.
"If officers with proper credentials
come ttj- me and ask to inspect my boat
I shall not make £n objection. My
orders are to let no one aboard except
and I assume that officers designated
by the American. navy department
have that right. I have no secret to
conceal. I have not as yet, however,
received, any communication from
Captain Hughes or the collector of the
port in regard to the matter."
'Meantime Captain Hughe& and his
two .assistants had boarded a tug and
gone to the pier where the submarine
is moored.
Von xBernstorff Visits Konlg.
New York, July 11.—Count von
Bernstorff, ambassador from Germany
to the United States, said that tomor
row he will go to Baltimore, "unoffi
cially" to see- the urfderwater liner
Deutschland, and congratulate the
captain.
"I am going to Baltimore only as a
German citizen and not as the am
bassador," he said.
Asked what the mall s&cks con
tained which were aboard, he said.
"You must not forget that we have
had nt) mail from Germany for many
dsors. Here was the llrst chance to
send it, and of course, there was a
great deal of It. The submarine, I
should say, will not start its return for
at least two weeks. When It does re
turn I shall,be very happy to entrust
it with some mail from this side."

It was explained to Captain Konig
by the customs officials that the seal

would be required in accordance with
the government rules after the out
break of the war to prevent violation
of neutrality by ships of belligerent
nations in American ports. Captain
Konig said he expects to start on his

concerned about the regulation.
MAY 9ARRY PASSENGERS..
Three Applications to Cross (fesan on
Deutschland Received.
Baltimore, July' 11.—Only the light in
his clear blue eyes and the laughter
from lips ordinarily stern set gave a
hint of Capt. £aul Kqnig*s tremendous
feeling over the exploit of the subma
rine Deutschland, which he com
manded, as he told the story of th')
submarine's remarkable voyage across
the Atlantic. .'
And while the captain was telling his

amazement was being madet the of

Believed to Be Directing Raids.
Washington, July 11.—General Car
ranza has been told that negotiations
for the settlement of the border trouble
need not wait the return of Secretary
Lansing from his vacation.
It is expected that Carranza will pro
pose a formal conference rather than
informal conversation between Ambas
sador Arredondo and the state depart
ment. American officials will accede
to any plan which will assure quick
action.
War department officials had no re
ports and discounted rumors or revolt
in the Carranza garrison at Chihuahua.
The Mexican embassy issued a denial
of this report.
Reports credited to American refu
gees that two sailors were killed recent
ly at Tampico when their launch was
fired on by Carranza soldiers were de
nied by the state and navy depart
ments. Officials said the story was
based on the incident at Tampico June
25, when Carranza soldiers fired on a
privately owned American tug and no
one was hurt.
Acting Secretary Polk In the absence
of Secretary Lansing attended the cab
inet meeting today and reported on the
informal conversation he had with Ar
redondo.
Villa Band Has Divided.
The Villa bandits who attacked the
Carranza garrison at tliminez and
Corralitos', last week, -were reported to
day In dispatches to the Mexican em
bassy here,, to •have* separated into two
divisions, one going north to the Texas
border, and the other toward Chihua
hua, into Durango.
A message from Andreas Garcia, Car
ranza consul at El Paso, said that the
troops of the de facto government,
enough numbers to destroy the bandits,
had followed them closely.
Border reports that the Carranza
garrison at Santa.Rasalia had revolted
and joined-.the Villa men were denied
by Consul'Garcia. 'K
Villa Directing Raids.
El Paso, Tex., July 11.—Mexican au
thorities in Chihuahua City believe that
Villa is directing, if not actually lead
ing, the bandits In their operations in
southern Chihuahua, according to an
American in close touch with Mexican
affairs, who reached the border from the
capital today. He said that General
Trevlno, commanding the government
troqps In Mexico, has reports that be
fore the fight at Jimlnez the Villistas
took and sacked the town of Diaz,
some miles north, and cut off the ears
of the captives. Substantiating the
story'of the branding of prisoners was
the story of a Mexican soldier who re
ported to General Gonzales, upon his
arrival In Juarez, that his ears had been
ciopped, following his capture at
Jimlnez.
HEAR'ST RANCH SEIZED.
Carranza Authorities Operating Prop
erty at Babicora.
American Field Headquarters, Mex
ico, by radio to Columbus, N. M., July
11.—The great Hearst ranch at Babi
cora has been taken over by the Car
ranza government and is now operated
by a manager installed by the Car
ranza military authorities, according
to a statement by John C. Hayes,
manager of the ranch, who passed
thru here on his way to El Paso.
Hayes left Babicora at the time the
American expedition quit Namiquipa
for the north. He brought 110 horses
with him as far as flaleana to save
them from seizure by the Carranzlstas
who came north as the Americans re
tired.
Babicora ranch Is nearly a hundred
miles south of the present field head
quarters of General Pershing.
VILLISTAS ARE DEFEATED.
Attack Parral and Suffer Heavy Losses
in Savage Battle.
Chihuahu City. Mexico. July 11.—
The main body of the Villa force, go
ing back from Jimlnez, attacked Par
ral. fifty miles southwest but was de
feated by Oarranza men after a sav
age* battle, says a report received by
General Trevlno.
The report forwarded by General
Garcia at iparral, says the bandits suf
fered heavy losses and retreated to
Sombreretillo, a few miles southwest
of Parral. It adds that If they make
a stand there deciding battle of the
campaign should be fought today or
tomorrow, the de facto cavalry under
Generals Domingo Arrietta and Matias
Is almost within striking distance of
this place.
Jeneral Garcia gave no details of
ttie light, which he described as sav
age, promising to send a full report
of the battle later. He said that it
was evidently the Villistas' intention
to drive off the Parral garrison so that
the town could be looted and perhaps
more ammunition obiainci.
The number of troops engaged is not
stated. The ParraJ garrison has pre
viously been estimated at aibout 400

New York. July 11.—A large In

new cases in the epidemic of infantile
paralysis was reported today. During
the last twenty-four hours 195 new
cases developed in the five boroughs of
New York City and there were thirty

previous twenty-four hour record. In
Brooklyn sixty-eight new cases were
reported Monday as against 155 today.
„There are now a total of 1,278 cases

Waukegan, 111., July ¥1.—Arguments
for the defense were begun today by
Leslie P. Hanna In behalf of Will H.
Orpet, charged with tho murder o£
Marian Lambert.
"The defendant," said iMr. Hanna.
"took the stand aa a fair witness. Tho
shock of his arrest and of Marian's
death had worn off. He was no ionser
the same youth, who without counsel,
talked erratically, perhaps, Just- after
his arrest
"It would have been folly for htm to
go on the stand unless he was to toll
the truth and all the truth."
"When he was arrested tho whols
current of his life was changed." went
on the lawyer. "Officers of the tow
besieged him and the papers cried
'murder, murder*. It seemed to him
as If the whole world were arrayed
against him. He simply did his best,
until the advico to which he was en
titled came to his assistance."
Mr. Hanna referred to Attorney Jo
hn's cross examination as "brutal and
unfair," and warned the Jurors that
they were not to remember his Insin
uating questions, but Orpet's replies te
them,

Jury box and spoke in a roles so soft

Hanna said:
"Marian's death by-sntotde let alone
murder, meant exposure to If ths
facts alleged by tho state are accepted.
This chance of exposure with MwVa
living were as nothing compared to
tho certainty of it if she died by vio
lence."
"But after all," went on the lawyer,
"the backbone of tho state's i*aae was
founded on the belief that tbe cyanide
of potassium which killed Marian was
a part of that In the greenhouse over
which the defendant's father bad
charge. That factor has disappeared
and with its disappearance appeared
the innocence of this boy. The state
admits that the greenhouse substance
was not potassium cyanide at all but
cyanide of sodium."
Mr. Hanna was followed by State's
Attorney Ralph J. Dady,
