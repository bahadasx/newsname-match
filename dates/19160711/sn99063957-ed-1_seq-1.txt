' fierce Fighting at Verdun Continues-Four British

Berlin, July 11. The great allied offensive will end in
defeat within a few weeks and will be followed by nego
tiations for peace, in the opinion of well inf ormed persons
in Berlin.
The check administered to the British in the death
struggle north of the Somme has given rise to the natural
hope that peace will follow the' fighting in Picardi which
has been marked by unprecedented slaughter. The Ger
man people are practically a unit in believing the attempt
of the allies to force the German line is doomed to
failure.
" Except on one narrow sector, the British have been
unable to make any perceptible impression on the German
lines, despite their overwhelming superiority in men. Im
petuous dashes have frequently carried General Haig's
men into German positions where they were immediately
cut off and killed or captured. The French, more prudent,
have made some progress south of the Somme but thus
far neither French nor British
f ul attack necessary to break
the west and roll the Germans
The feeling prevails here that when the extent of the
British losses becomes fully known in England, coupled
with the fact that the German line still remains intact,
public opinion will demand that peace be made . without
further slaughter. J ; :
German reports are quite certain that the British will
never quit the attack without first feeling out all sectors
of the German front in the hope of finding an opening.
But they are confident that the British will have no great
er success against the strongly fortified lines further
north, than they have had between the Ancre and the
Somme. .
Some of the more optimistic of the German corre
spondents, notably the correspondent at the front of the
Vossiche Zeitung, believe that the allies offensive already
has been brought to a standstill.

THE ALLIES' OBJECT
Washington, July 11. Great
Britain and France will do ev
erything in their power to pre
vent the United States recogniz
ing the super-submarine Deut
schland as a ship of commerce,
and to. prevent the operation of
a liue of submarine freight car
riers proposed by the North Ger
man Lloyd Steamship company.
This was admitted at the embas
sies of the two governments to
day. Just Who Is Backing Proposi
tion Keeps Curious Ones
Guessing
Is the proposed railroad from this city
the Bend a lull line or is it oaciceu o
the Chicago, Milwaukie & Ht. Paul a
Rockefeller railroad? What has Judge
Grant B. Dimick of Oregon City, presi
dent of the Willamette Valley Southern
to do with the enterprise t And where
does the Bantiam Electric company of
Portland fit into the scheme t
These are some of the questions puz
zling the minds of men who are watch
ing developments in tho local railroad
field. .
That the Milwaukie, a Standard Oil
property, is back of the undertaking
and is working through Dimick, whose
road is popularly believed to have the
backing o'f the Rockefellers, is one ver
sion of the affair. As representative in
Oregon, Dimick is thought to have been
chosen to ovei-Bee the securing of a
right of way, terminal facilities and the
preliminary steps in the building of the
new road.
Instead, then, of the road being a
Hill enterprise as has been given out,
it may be the first atop in a battle for
dominance in this section of the Rocke
fellers against the Morgans of the
Southern Pacific and the Hills of the
Great Northern. . . i
The road, in llgut or recent uevri-
opments, may extend from Mt. Angel
throucrh th a City to Bend. A me -
lamette Valley Southern connects Mt.
Angel with Oregon .City the Rockefel
lers could thus secure a continuous line
from Bend practically to Portland and
tapping a section rich in natural re
sources and eood patrons of railroads.
That the line may urancn out so as to
include Silvertou with its huge new
sawmill is thought probable. At present
surveyors are at work near Silverton
and they may be working for the pro
posed line. Tho route lias been lined
out as far as Niagara iu the direction of
Bend.
Tim explanation of the hnntiam r.lec-
trie company's alleged activity in the
matter is that it is used merely to help
cover up the activities of the Milwau
kie. It is said tnnt tue wages or wie
surveyors and Other help employed in
the field are paid through this compauy
whose agent makes regular trips to the
scene of operations to squure tue pay
roll. Sometime in tho fall backers of the
new road are expected to appear before
tho ritv council and mukc demands as
fn franchise and terminal facilities in
this city. That they will ask a right
in through Church street to the
fair crounds. at which place the road
will cross the 8. P. tracks is considered

as the site 'tor the depot of the new made known the number of men ho be
line, in this city. This is closo to the lieves will be necessary to furnish ade-
business section and directly on the
right of way believed sought by the
railroad people.
From the depot tho line would run out
Church street to Mission. At this point
two routes of egress arc available. One
is through Bush's pasture, the other
along the creek to the Bingham place
or east of it and thence southeast out
of the city limits.
As it stands, the road could condemn
a right of way through the Bush pas
ture. Should the transfer of the pasture
to the city as a public park be consum
mated, however, the road would be
blocked In this direction as one of the
conditions uudcr which the offer was
made to the city is that it is to be tineS
for park purposes only. The city has
not yet obtuined title to the tract but it
is believed that this will be settled
The history of railroading shows that
the roads aud their backers like to keep
things under cover until all is ready for
the big splurge. Un this account many
feel that Dimick or whoever is back of
the line have been content to let the
public believe the proposed line wm to
: ,p , jjill road in order to keep the real
movers in the background.

Baltimore, Md., July 11. With no re
