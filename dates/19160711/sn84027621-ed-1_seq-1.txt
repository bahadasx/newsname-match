AMERICANS IN MEXICO
TREATED LIKE CHINAMEN
Say the Refugees who Reached Tampa
on the Transport Sumner
- (Tampa Times)"
When the United States army
transport Sumner discharged its load
of refugees from many Mexican cities
Saturday it turned loose upon Ameri
can soil score on score of men who
speak in bitterest terms of President
Wilson and his foreign policy. With
but few exceptions the refugees assert
the administration at Washington has
made a mistake in putting off from
time .to time the intervention they
believe must come. -
"Foreign policy," scoffed one. "Why,
anybody who has ever been outside
the states, and looked back as an
American citizen knows that the
United States has no "foreign policy."
The attitude is not one of a few
disgruntled citizens. It is not sour pro
test of men who have suffered much
and endured much until the end of
their endurance has been reached
for, although the flight from Mexico
without clothes and money" that most
of them were forced into has added a
great deal to their bitterness, not one
was encountered who was not willing
to lose all he had aye, and his life if
necessary f or the honor and glory of
the Stars and Stripes.
"Like Chinamen," is the way one
referred to the treatment accorded
Americans. "A few years ago they
respected the citizen of the United
States, though they did not like them.
Today they despise them, they look
down upon them as an inferior, cow
ard race. Americans are showed into
the streets, are ' spat upon, are called
swine, dogs and every indignity that
can be heaped upon their heads is
freely- vented.". -
Biliousness and Stomach Trouble
"Two years ago I suffered from f re
quent attacks of stomach trouble and
biliousness." writes Miss Emma . Ver

OKLAWAHA VALLEY
RAILROAD EXTENSION
Road May Build by Eustis and Mul
berry to the Gulf
"The Ocklawaha Valley- railroad
proposes building an extension which
may come through Mount Dora," says
the Mount Dora Topic. , "The road is
now in operation between Palatka and
Ocala, and the line which the com
pany now proposes to build will run
from Ocala to Boca Grande on the
gulf about eighty miles south of
Tampa." The road as proposed would
connect with the Tampa Northern.
The route Jbeing considered runs thru
Umatilla, Eustis, Mount Dora, Tan
gerine and Lake Gem, The Topic
says that stock is now being offered
in the road and adds that the exten
sion thus suggested would be of great
advantage to all sections crossed and
property values considerably increas
ed. Mount Dora folks are particularly
interested and the matter is being
discussed seriously in that city and
places nearby. Times-Union Short
Talks.
The Star has heard a good deal
about this proposed extension, but has
refrained from commenting on it, as
it has not heard of any defienite plans
being decided on. We understand that
if the extension is made, the Okla
waha Valley road, true to its name,
will probably follow the river up to
Eustis, and from there go on south
until it connects with the C. H. & N.,
at Mulberry, thus making a central
trunk line thru Florida. .

Additional equipment, consisting
mainly, of shoes and clothing? has been
ordered, and until this arrives the
regiment -will be in no condition to
move to the border. Most of the men,
however, have been fitted out, though

or clothing are yet poorly equipped.

rejected at the last physical examina
tion have not arrived, and these men
remain in camp, taking the regular
duties imposed on those who succeed
ed in passing the tests.
Only two men with dependent fami

AIRIH5 FIGIITIIIG
FOR THE
Hundreds of Them Are to be Found
in the Canadian Regiments
in France
(Associated Press)
British Headquarters, France, July,
1. American citizens have seen hot
ter fighting in the last two weeks
thexn any American since the Appo-
matox campaign. They have endur
ed as heavy shell fire as the German
guns ever directed at the British
fiont and know .what it was to ,
charge into the German trenches with
bayonet and bomb in pouring rain
through the mud in the small hours of
the morning.
There are more Americans scatter
d among the Canadian ' battalions
than most people realize. , Some of
these were living in Canada when the
war began; some crossed the border
and enlisted for the sake of being in
a scrap; some felt it a duty to strike
a blow for the Allies.
If a man took the oath and put on
a uniform a Canadian recruiting of
ficer did not ordinarily bother, if he
were a sound man, which side of the
border he came from. Besides, the
recruit sometimes had a bad memory
oii that score himself. "What part
of Canada are you from?" a British
officer asked a Canadian private.
"Out West, sir."
"What part of the west?'
"The far west, sir."
"What part I asked. Haven't you
earned yet to give a definite answer
to an officer's question?" Y
"Spokane, sir."
"Where is that, in Manitoba?"
"In that neighborhood, sir."
After a man has been wounded the
truth is more likely to come out. Af
ter an examination of a bad jaw fac
ture the surgeon said to one wounded
American:
"You've a bad smash, but' we shall
pull through and fix you up as good
as new."
"Are you giving it to me straight?"
was the feeble Question.
"Yes you can depend on it."
"Well, if that's the dope and no kid
ding, I wish you would write to my
mother out in Ohio and tell her."
Those who were looking for a scrap
frankly admit they have had it. No
one questions how they stood up to it
along with their Canadian comrades.
Nor are they all privates. Three of
ficers who were killed in the retaking
of Observatory Hill were Americans.
