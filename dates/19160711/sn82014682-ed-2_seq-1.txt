; The cable tars that 'the militia bu

le iiew bath to be subscribed tti
by" guardsmen of the mainland 'and
the Territory of HawaiL This reversal
Is apparently the result of advice from
the- militia bureau's: legal advisers.

oath is satisfactory, and that the new
form will be required only, in the case
of new enlistments. The status of
those already members remains, the
' . same as before. . ' v-. :
Today's cable means that a great
deal of work win be saved, as Uk
lng the new oath has Just been begun,
and has proved somewhat tedious as
regards securing signatures, especial
ly as each company member was re
quired to sign in triplicate- on three
separate sheets. ' V -
In ; the case of jof fleers, however,

Not Ready to Believe? Off-hand

Letter to Wilson
If Circuit Judge Thoma B. Stuart
ever falls into line for the Hawaii
governorship, he will have the undiv
ided support and assistance of the so
called -McCandless-Wllson faction ot
the local Democratic party, L. IT Mc
Candless, leader of the faction, de
clared today. : . v . : t! ' ,0
But thia.doea not necessarily mean,
McCandless added, that the , "Bour
bons of Pauahi street" are in accord
with Judge Stuart in the attack which
he has made on President .Wilson,
Attorney-general Gregory and Secre
tary of the Interior Lane, nor does it
mean that they are supporting his at
tack.' '"'A: " ';
McCandless Intimated in the inter
view that he is not wholly Inclined to
believe that Stuart's attack is as se
rious as many believe It to be; "
"Personally." said McCandless, "I
think that anything unfair which It
has been reported Stuart said against
the president should be taken with a
grain oft salt unless it conies from
Stuart himself.; . ' - . " '
McCandless" added-that . he recently
received - a letter from Judge Stuart,
in ' which tlcf mention was made of: the
president, or the. Judge's attack " on
the, chief executive - and other high
government officials; : '
: "Judge Stuart went with us to see
the president while we were in Wash
mgtoh, Aid told the that hfe liked tdnr
very much, his manner and presence,"
McCandless continued. " "
- "Our f afction of :the party Is not
necessarily V supporting 'what Judge
jStuart says. The faction is friendly
to the Wilson administration. , The ac
tion of our delegates, at the conven
tion will show that We feel that he
should and will be reelected.
McCandless, .however, did . not ex
press the same friendly feeling toward
Gregory, and' Lane. ,.-:
"I do hot think that Lane has treat'

sitions in Hawaii -:,?t; 4';
Thhr does not mean that I an)
either friendly or unfriendly to Lafll
or GregbTy'r but X do 1 not - believe the
latter should have appointed' Repub
licans. And the Bame applies . to
Lane." ' -v
McCandless declared .that he did
not think there. could ever ,be .as
"rabid a 'RebuBTTcan" In Hawaii as
the present governor. "But," 'M add
ed, "I am not inclined-to believe the
reports of Judge Stuart's attacks until
I have it direct from Judge Stuart him
self."
- He emphasised the statement that
his "hat Is not to the rittg" for the
governorship, but-declared that he
wanted to see a Democrat in office as
governor. . '
"And 1 told them this In Washing

and why should we not have what
goes with it? During the last admin
istration, how long did it take the
Republicans to clean out every Demo

He declared that; with the anticipat
