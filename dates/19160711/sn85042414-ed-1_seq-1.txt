as never was possible before," and
he appealed to the house to take ad

might never occur.
There were features in the settle

none would have chosen voluntarily

the proposals to parliament and rec
ommending their acceptance.
War Chief Factor.
"The dominating factor," Mr. As
quith said, "which made us all will
ing to become parties or sponsors to
this measure is the war."
While not going into details, the
premier indicated the main lines of
the agreement, including the exclusion
of six Ulster counties. He said the
Irish parliament would be composed
of the members at present returned
to the Imperial parliament, while the
appeal court in Dublin would be ap
pointed by the imperial executive.
Mr. Asquith recalled his visit to
Ireland, which he said was made to
ascertain whether the Irish parties
might not be disposed to come to an
agreement. As a result of what he
learned, David Lloyd George was
reputed to have opened negotiations.
Lloyd George quickly discovered an
agreement was possible on the basis
of immediate action of a home rule
measure with the exclusion of six
Ulster counties ahfl the boroughs of
Belfast, Newry and Londonberry.
AU Views Obtained.
There was no section representative
of any substantial body of opinion,
Mr. Asquith said, whose views were
not Invited by Mr. Lloyd George. All
parties concerned took the responsi
bility of submitting their agreed rec
ommendations to parliament.
As soon as the premier concluded
his statement he was pried with ques
tions, but he referred all inquiries to
the bill which will be introduced next

Guardian referring to the German
submarine Deutschland.
The Daily Graphic in commenting
on the trans-Atlantic voyage, says:
"While the submarine trip does
credit to German enterprise and sea
manship, it leaves the maritime situ

of disaster is immense and the ca
pacity of submarines to carry the

Insignificant."

"Before beginning our trip," said
Captain Koenig, "we had several
weeks of practice in our vessel In the
