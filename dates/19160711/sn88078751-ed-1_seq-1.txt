coast.
The vessel carries mail and 'a cargo
of 7C0 tons of costly chemicals and
dyestuff3 and is to carry back home
a similar amount of nickel and crude
rubber, sorely needed by the German
army.
Fifteen days out from Bremerhaven
to Baltimore, the submarine readied
safety between the Virginia Calais at
1:45 o'clock Sunday morning, passing
in on the surface.
The Deutschland was menby Cap
tain Fred Cbcke of the Virginia Pilots
association, who was bringing the sub
marine to this port when she was met
by the tug TImmins, on board of
which was Captain Hinsch. Captain
Cocke then left the undersea craft,
which was ordered by Captain Hinsch
to Baltimore.
Captain Cocke stated that the un
dersea craft is more than 300 feet
long, 30 feet wide and was drawing 17
feet of water when she entered the
Virginia Capes. The submersible Is
propelled by two Deisel engines of COO
horsepower and makes about 14 knots
an hour. She Is larger thai the aver
age freight steamer and makes a speed
of about three knots In excess of the
speed attained by the average freight
boat.
The Deutschland Is commanded by
Captain Kairlg and manned by a crew
of 29 Germans. She left the German
port on June 23, according to the
story Captain Kairlg told Captain
Cocke. Captain Kairlg, according to
Captain Cocke, who was shown
through the submersible, told him
that the trip across the Atlantic was
uneventful. The captain of the sub
marine said that he passed several
British merchant ships and one Brit
ish battleship.
Submarine Unarmed.
The Deutschland Is unarmed. Her
master and German representatives
Jn this country probably will contend
that her status Is that of an unarmed
merchant ship.
Captain Kairlg stated that he an
ticipated no trouble In eluding the
English cruisers expected off the
capes any minute for the return voy
age. Tho plans of the master of the
submersible are unknown at this time.
He, however, is expected to leave for
Germany within tho next week or ten
days.
British warships were scattered all
along the Atlantic coast and they
were ordered to capture or sink this
defiant craft at all hazards. Twenty

I Captain Kalrig and his officers 61
I ways on watch for the enemy had
J sighted a warship when 100 miles oft
the capes. They sighted another on
their starboard bow, bearing towards"
them, but it was Friday afternoon
and Captain Kairig decided to send
his craft beneath the waters of: the
Atlantic and to sail in the direction
from which the warship had come.
He sailed south for perhaps 100 miles,
and when the submarine again camo
to the surfnee it was dark. Ho was
then in the vicinity of Ilntteras. There
were no warships In sight and he set
a straight course for the Virginia
Capes. Captain Kairig declared hla
vessel was not under water more than
two hours on Saturday. He said:
"I consider our voyage uneventful.
We had very little trouble. Once we
had trouble withour underwater .lights
and air tanks, but they delayed us
only a few hours. We were over S00
miles off the short course, which
made us behind the time we could
make under more favorablo condi
tions. "We ran into rough weather almost
every day for a week.' We were forced
to submerge on these occasions to es
cape high seas. It is more comfort
able under water when the sea is
' rough. We could not stand on our
feet on the surface, and the cargo be
gan to shift. When we passed near
the Diamond Shoal lights we were
partly submerged, the weather was so
rough. Our ship is as good aB new.
We made tho voyage In good time
considering the difficulties we encoun
tered, and probably will do bettw
going back."
DIPLOMATIC PROBLEM
State Department . Must Determine
Status of German Submarine.
Washington, July 10. The arrival
of tho German submarine Deutsch
land at Baltimore brings to the Unit
ed States government an unprece
dented diplomatic problem.
Tho indications are that this gov
ernment will not be stampeded into
action either by the novelty of the
submarine's! feat In crossing the At
lantic or by the contentions of the
German and British government as to
the status of the ship in an American
. port.
If tho Deutschland entered uaui
morq as a warship this government
will, it is explained, at once apply the
International regulations which gov
ern the sojourn of a belligerent ves
sel in a neutral port. The Deutsch
land will be given twenty-four hours
to leave, In addition to uch time as
Is necessary for replenishing her fuel
supply and making necessaiy repairs.
If the Deutschland on !ho other
hand enters port as a privately owned
merchant cargo ship, bent on a peace
ful commercial or diplomatic mission,
the United States will recognize the
validity of tho German claim to Im
munity until facts are brought for
ward to disprove It.
Would Keep Out Scourge.
Chicago, July 10. An appeal for the
co-operation of every local physician
to prevent In Chicago tho possibility
of an epidemic of infantile paralysis
was sent out by Dr. John Dill Kobert

spent tho entire day In his office per
fecting details of a preventative cam
paign and waiting for reports on new
cases.

Thoroughly alarmed by the spread

New York, July 10. The board of
health reported that during the papt
twenty-four hours eighty-eight new
cases of infantile paralysis have been
reported from the five boroughs of the
city, Brooklyn leading with sixty-six.
Now that the health department has
arrived at a somewhat systematic
method of handling the cases all art
being sent to the Willard Parker hos
pital, In Manhattan, and this rule pre
vails no matter in what section of the
city the cases are reported.
The department was assisted in Its
work by 21,000 civilian volunteers,
members of the Home Defense league,
an auxiliary of the police department.
These assistants inaugurated their
work by surveyinglark alleys and va

FAMILY IS SMITTEN;
the department of health and co-operating
research agencies are seriously
embarrassed by the shortage of mon
keys. The monkey Is the only animal
upon which tests to Identify the med
iums of communication of the disease
can be made. The Rockefeller Insti
tute, however, which was established
by John D. Rockefeller to fight Infan-
tile paralysis after his young grand
son died of the disease, has 100 mon
keys collected In the Philippines
ready for shipment. Because of dis
ease among animals on the islands
there has been an embargo on their
clnns who are combatting the out
break, under the auspices of the fed
eral, state and municipal health offi
cials. In Brooklyn members of the
league reported several violations of
the sanitary laws. In Manhattan 1C0
members of the league were taken
around precincts on the lower East
Side by half a dozen police captains.
In nearly every Instance persons ap
proached by the police and tho homa

exportation. This is why the monkeys
have not come to New York. If the
efforts of the public health service
are successful In having the embargo
raised, so far as the monkeys are con
cerned, although the animals will not
arrive for some weeks, Dr. Emerson
believes that the scientists of the fed
eral government, of the Rockefeller
Institute and of other research bodies
will be able to make great headway
In solving the problem of who and
what are the most dangerous "car
riers" of Infantile paralysis.

London, July 10. Dispatches from
Petrograd report the Russian forces
going from success to success.
Not only nas General Letchitzky, in
tho south, occupW the railroad junc
tion at Delatyn, west of Kolomea, thus
cutting off General Von Bothmer from
hla supply base, but General Bruslloff,
In the north, Is making. surprising ad
vances on both sides of the Kovel
railway toward the Stokhod river.
The Russian communication reports
tho enemy force In this region retir
ing In great disorder and adds that
the Russians have occupied Hulvlche,
which Is about twenty-four miles to
the east of Kovel, while apparently
the Russians aro already across the
Stoghod river somewhere in the re
gion of Janovka.
German possession of Baranovichi
and Kovel are absolutely essential if
she is to retain her hold over the in
vaded parts of Poland and Lithuania,
but It Is considered 'likely that It Is
only a matter of a few days before the
Russians will be in possession of Ko
vel, which would compel Von Linsin
gen's retirement from the Lutsk sa
lient. German dispatches express anxiety
over the Russian advance.
Fighting between the Ancre and the
Somme was less violent than in the
last two days, tho British war office
reports. A fierce German counter at
tack was made against the sector held
by the New 3ealanders. The Teutons
succeeded In penetrating the lines,
but wore ejected within a half hour.
There is a strengthening in the Ger
man artillery bombardment. This Is
taken here as forecasting a German
counter offensive on a large scale.
The lists of casualties among Brit
ish officers issued in the past four
days, apparently composed almost al
together of losses suffered in the past
week's advance, gives a total of 94
killed, 504 wounded and 30 missing.
A notable advance was made by
the French toward the fortress of Pe
ronne. On a front of two and one
half miles the French penetrated the
Teuton lines from one to two kilo
meters and took the village of
Biaches.
The news shows little change in
the relative positions on the western
front. Berlin admits the loss of
Hardacourt. It Is believed in "Berlin
that the Sixth army and reserves have
the situation well : Land on the
Somme front and that nothing can In
terfere with the progress' of the Ver
dun campaign.

ments In Mexican Situation.
El Paso, Tex., July 10. Telegrams,
letters and persons arriving at the
border all carry tho same reports that
General Villa Is in the vicinity of tho
Florido river, not far from tho Chl-huahua-Durango
border; that he is
directing the movements of the army
of General Calixto Contreras, and that
he is holding another considerable
body of men in reserve awaiting the
moment when ho shall have "suffi
ciently recovered from his wounds
and rheumatism" to stand the hard
rides and rapid movements of cam
paigning. It look3 as though Villa's forces un
der the personal leadership of Con
treras have won another victory over
the troops of the de facto government.
General Domingo Arrleta. command
ing the 2,000 Carranzista troops sent
out by General Trevino to disperse
the ViJHstas who had slaughtered the
command of General Ramos and later
looted and then abandoned tho town
of JImlncz, reported by wire to Gen
eral Trevino that he had encountered
the rebels at Las Nlevas, southwest
of Jlminez, and that he was then en
gaging the Villistas. Since then no
word had been received from Arrleta
y General Trevino at Chihuahua
City.
A suspicion was manifest that the
troops of General Arrleta might have
revolted when they came In touch
with the Villistas. All the Arrleta'
troops, together with their com
mander, formerly served under Villa.
Some months ago the Arrletas camo
Into disfavor with the Carranza gov
ernment, which had well defined sus
picion of the loyalty of the Durangc
commander.
Every move In the new rebellion
bears the Imprint of Villa's own strat
egy, according to American army offi
cers on the border. The bold attack
on General Ramos and his command,
the ferocity with which the Villistas
fought, the promptitude with which
they attacked and looted Jlminez and
then slipped away, were typical Villa
moves, It is asserted.
