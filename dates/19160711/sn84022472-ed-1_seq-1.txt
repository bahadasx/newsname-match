With one known case ot infantile
paralysis existing in Bridgeport, about
200 known cases of septic sore throat,
1,200 refugee children already here
from New York city to escape the in
fantile scourge, 25 of whom are defi
nitely recorded as having come from
quarantined blocks,) Mayor Wilson to
day took personal supervision of the
situation. . ; .'s. - ' . s
Every available Inspector has been
ordered to assist the school nurses In
thei work at the boat landing and
railway stations, and plans are today
being discussed to avail of the many
physicians . who have volunteered to
guard . the highway entrances to
Bridgeport which are declared to be
the main arteries of travel for the
New Tork refugeea
Stepney is today known to be the
objective point of hundreds of- New
Tork children who are being , sent
through Bridgeport by the New York
Settlement society. This fact became
public today when ,the local health
department was notified by the New
York- authorities that automobile
loads of children had been Inspected
and passed by them as immune from
contagion. They will be permitted
passage through this city today. ,
The meeting of 'the health board to
night may result in radical measures
for the protection of Bridgeport, for
it is unofficially , announced that sev
eral reports to be submitted by Health
Officer K. A. McLellan and his subor
dinate inspectors will' recommend ad
ditional inspectors and plans for in
specting every person coming by trol
ley or roadway. Mayor .Wilson will
attend the meeting.
No child from New York or sur
rounding boroughs may enter the city
of Bridgeport today without a pass
signed by one of the local health de
partment nurses or Inspectors.
Reports received 'by t)'r. McLellan
today from his staff shows that 1,200
children have been inspected and
passed Into this city. Of this number
25 cases are from quarantined dis.
tricts in Bridgeport and one is known
to have come directly from a house
in which infantile paralysis patients
were confined. These suspects are be
ing visited dailySy nurses and will be
closely observed.
Because of the fact that several re
fugees in this city have been found
to have changed residences after ar
rival, passes are being Issued to all
incoming children passed by the In
spectors and lodgtng- house keepers
and residents are warned to take no
strange children into their homes un
less in possession of such a pasa It
Is estimated that with 1,200 arrivals
by train and boat within a period of
three days, a much larger number
have arrived by automobile. There
are probablj3.000 refugees in Bridge
port and surrounding towns today.
