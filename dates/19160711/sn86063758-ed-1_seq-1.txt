IWDERWATER LINER
REACHES BALTIMORE
First Submarine Merchantman Brings
Costly Chemicals From Oermany.
* Baltimore, July 9.?The world's
first submarine merchantman, the
German underwater liner Deutschland,,
anchored below Baltimore tonight,
after coming safely across the
Atlantic, passing the allied blockading
squadrons and eluding enemy
cruisers watching for her off the
American coast. She carries mail
and a. raren rvf 75ft tons of costly !
chemicals and dyestuffs and is to car?
ry back home a similar amount of
nickel and crude rubber, eorely needed
by the German army.
Sixteen days out from Bremerhaven
to Baltimore, the submarine reached
the Virginia capes at 1:45 o'clock this
morning, passing in on the surface,
covered by darkness which settled
over the entrance of the bay with the
setting of the moon. Once inside the
visitor threw caution aside and began
shrieking his sireen, signalling a pilot
and at the same time attracting
the attention of the tug, Thomas F. J
Timmons, which had been waiting in 1
the lower bay for nearly two weeks to

German Flag Flying1.
> Three hours later the big submarine
started up the bay with theGerIman
merchant flag flying, under her
own power, piloted by Capt. Frederick
D. Cocke, of the Virginia Pilots'
association, and convoyed by the Tim??

mms. sue was maxmg more man -us
knots an hour and could have docked
in Baltimore tonight, but arrangements
had been made for receiving
her with formal^ceremonies tomorrow
and her captain was ordered to wait
in the lower harbor. He and his
crew of 29 men remained aboard their
craft.
. . Regarding- his vessel as a merchantman,
subject to no unusual restrictions,
the skipper, whose name is
said" to be capt. Kairig, went up me
Chesapeake without waiting to notify
local customs and quarantine authorities
of his presence. He was five .
hours away before Norman Hamilton, '
collector of Norfolk and Newport
News, heard the news, and started oa
the trail on board the coast guard
cutter Onondaga. At last reports the
\ Onondaga had not reached the subJ
marine, and it is understood that she
merely was ordered out to keep the
strange craft under surveillance as a
neutrality precaution. Quarantine
port regulations will be complied with
when the vessel moves up to her dock
tomorrow.
Little was Known here tonight
about what happened during the
epoch-making cruise, which in a
j- small measure at least, breaks the
blockade on German trade with the
rest of the world. iNone of the submarine's
crew had landed and the
agents of her owners had received
only meagre reports. Such information
as was available came indirectly
from the pilot and from Capt. Hanz
F. Hinsch, of the North. German Lloyd
,V liner, -Xeckar, laid up here since
the beginning of the war. Capt.
Hinsch boarded the Deutschland from
the Timmins and made'the trip up the
fcav with her.
I
According to the accounts reaching
here, the underwater liner's superstructure
was standing 15 feet above
the water when she came in. Until
daylight she showed no flag, but the
German merchant ensign was raised
at sun-up. Stories were circulate^
that the British or French cruisers
chased her at sea Thursday, but
L could not be confirmed.
The boat is consigned to A. Schup.
Oft 1/vTftl ftsrents of the
(uiavu^i ix. w.| ?
fCorth German Lloyd line, and her
cargo to the Eastern Forwarding
company, said to have been organized
within the past few weeks especially
to handle the business of underwater
iiners. The latter company has a pier
and warehouse, in which are stored
gcods to be loaded on the Dcjttsch
inna ior imi i etui u ui^.
^ In German quarters here the news
A of the submarine's arrival was hailed
with keenest delight. Those who !
knew of her coming had been conceal-!
in<? alarm for two or three days, as j
slie was due to arrive abDut the mid-j
o'le of last week. It is understood'
that she travelled more than 4,000 !
t
miles, going some 800 miles out of j
her course to avoid enemy ships.
The Deutschland is no converted
war craft, but a brand new commerce
carrier, owned in Bremen and sent
here on a purely coDimercial mission, J
according to Henry G. Hilken, sen- j
ior member of the Shumacher concern.
She belongs to the Ozean Rhe- J
derei, Ltd., (Ocean Navigation com- j
pany, Ltd.), and was launched at Kiel.'
in March. * j
The novel project was conceived
about nine months ago, 'Mr. Hilken j
said, by P. A. Lohmann, head of a'
Bremen exporting and importing concera,
who organized the Ocean >Navi-!
gation company. iMr. Lohmann is the
son of a former director general of j
the ^Corth German Lloyd Steamship!
company and has important German
interests associated with him.
)
The undersea liner, Mr. Hilken understands,
is about J15 long and 30
feet team and is propelled by two j
great Deinel oil engines. She Is as!
large if not larger than any of the
German naval submarines. <As to details
of her construction, Mr. Hilken
said he "was lacking in information.
"Most of the information that was
%
sent to me," he said, 4is probably
carefully tucked away in a pigeon
hole of the British admiralty office,
but I don't care now. The Deutechland
is here, nererthe'e&s."
Mr. Hilken is an American and his
firm has been in business here operating
ships under the American flag j
since 1824.
Carl A.#Lueaerltz, the German consul,
is a member of the firm.
/~
When the Deutschland will return
or whether it is planned to have her
make regular transatlantic trips, Mr.
Hilken refused to discuss.
"This project was conceived," he
saicj, "by German commercial inter-,
ests who wanted to reopen trade with
the United States. It is a purely'
commercial proposition and that is
all there is to it."
If present plans are carried out, j
the public will not be allowed to in-:
spect the undersea wonder, nor will.
anybody except the federal authorities
be allowed to board her.
The pier of the Eastern Forwarding
company was boarded up today to
shut out the view of the curious and
the -Schumacher firm arranged to
surround the pier tomorrow morning
with a cordon of police.
Six months ago came first reports
i
that Germany was preparing to put j
into the transatlantic trade a line of j
submarines that would dwarf in size :
and achievements thp U-boats, which '
have been Germany's chief reliance in!
her conduct of war at sea. London;
cable reports told of the organization j
of a company to inaugurate such a j
service and English experts were
quoted as saying they felt no surprise j
at the announcemnt of the.plans.
Officials of the Eastern Forwarding
company said tonight that a repre-!
sentative of the German embassy1
probably would come to Baltimore to j
greet the commander of the Deutsch- [
land. They were at pains to point out j
however, that the embassy would be
interested only informally; that the
submarine was a merchant ship pure
and simple, and as such ^should re
quire no uipiumauc reyre?euuiuuu? i
on her behalf.
The Deutschland is the first vessel
under the German merchant flag to
enter an American port since the
early days of the war. According to
reports, another submarine already is
on the way across, and among the
Deutsciiland's crew are members of
such vessels built or building, which i
will be emDloved rezularlv in trans- !
j atlantic trade as long a3 the war
I lasts.

Ifessage From the Kaiser.
Old Point, Va., July 9.?The German
submarine Deutschland, unarmed
and flying the flag of a merchantman,
passed through, the Virginia
Capes early today and proceeded up
Chesapeake bey to Baltimore, convoyed
by the tug Thomas F. Timmins. J
Her commander torn tne pilot mat sne
left a German port on June 3, that
he had 1.000 tons of cargo and a
quantity of mail aboard and brought

improvement and progressiveness.
The farms along the road seemed to
be abandoned because of the fact
that so many people are going to
town and leaving the farms in the
hands of a few who do not do justice
to them. Why not make small tracts
and sell them? We have too many
large land owners, whereas if small
tracts would -be made and sold with
a small rate of interest the land
would be cultivated on a better plan
and the people would live better.

those who come. The committee has
secured several prominent speakers.
Hon. A. J. Bethea, lieutenant governor,
and Hon. J. L. McLaurin, State
warehouse commissioner, have promised
to be present and address the
crowd. Probably other addresses will
be delivered bv others also. If you
wish to be with an intelligent and
prosperous crowd come to this barbecue.
This community is not in a dormant
state but it has the same ideals,
same culture as it had in the days of
our forefathers and added to them the
modern improvements and conveniences.
We stand on our own merits.
Our school is as good as any. It is
supported by a four mill tax, voted
unanimously. Everything gives promise
of rapid movement in every line.

HE *SAiSSED" HER AJTD
SHE SHOT HIM IS LEG
That is the reason that Fannie Stevens
gives for pouring a load of
No. 9 shot in the leg of Jim Childs,
a 14-year-old negro boy.
It occurred on Sunday afternoon in
the yard of Policeman H. D. Whit
taker in the western portion of the
city. Fannie was arrested by 'Sheriff
Blease and is now in jail and the reason
she gives for the deed is that the
boy "sassed" her and she would not
take that from any one. The shot
was fired at close range and the doctor
says the shot can not be picix-d
out and while the wound is not dangerous
it may be very serious before
it heals.

The county campaign opened up at
Jolly Street last Friday. There had
been a heavy rain in tho early forenoon
and as it was too wet to plow
a large number of farmers took the
day off to listen to the speeches of
the candidates and to meet those
who were running for offices for
which speech making was not customary.
The day was cool and
cloudy, an ideal one for an open air
meeting.
There were probably 350 or 400
people on the grounds most of whom
listened attentively to the srpeakers
for the various offices and although
it was late in the afternoon when the
I last speaker walked down from the
j platform the crowd seemed loath to
i IpavA. The dar nassed off auietlv and
tliere was little demonstration during
the 6peaking...
The candidates who spOke refrained
from any remarks of a personal nature
and the audience was quiet and
in a receptive state of mind throughout.
The barbecue was well cooked
and most efficiently served. As the
I speaking stand was almost within the
shadow of the elegant nev/ two story
school building nearly every candidate
made some happy illusion, to it.
At 10:4o Chairman Frank R. Hunter
called the meeting to order and
introduced the speakers. The candij j
dates for the senate spoke first and j
Mr. Alan Johnstone was the first of \
these.
Alan Johnstone.
'Mr. Johnstone said that he would |
speak of himself and his acts and1
that probably he would sometimes i
say "I" when he should say "we" for 1
while he had accomplished some!
things he did not claim credit, fori
everything the senate had done. He j
said he was willing for the search-1
light of scrutiny to be focused upon !
ills ill mc ocuai^.
When lie entered the senate there j
were three burning issues before the |
people?school improvement, road
improvement and the liquor question.
On these issues he centred his attention
and was instrumental in bringing
about the passage of good road laws
and the improvement of the common
i
school system. Did not claim all the,
credit for these improvements but;
contributed his part towards their ac- |
complishment.
He helped to frame an act that was
an aid to weak schools which became;
law and from an appropriation of!
$40,000 or $50,000 it has now grown
to $180,000 which was placed in the
hands of the State superintendent of
education for rural schools. Of this
amount Newberry county has received
?1,000.
(V-r. Johnstone spoke of the destruction
of the State dispensary system
and of his part in the work. He contended
that prohibition does prohibit
and cited Charleston as an example i
and while he admitted that city was
not absolutely dry yet conditions were
very much improved. He supported
the bill to appropriate a fund to enforce
the liquor law which was passed
and became law.
He spoke of his part in favoring
the passage of the law creating the
/'
insurance commission and that the
j revenues from this source in the
state treasury naa lnereaseu irum
$45,000 the first year to $185,000 at
the present time.
(He spoke of the inequalities in land
taxation in the different counties
which he thought should be remedied
by appropriate legislation. In concluding
he said he was running for
reelection and based his claim purely
on his record and his own merit
?al TT. Workman.
>Mr. Neal W. "Workman expressed

his gratitude for tne nattering vot-3
Jolly Street had given him two years
ago and thanked the voters in advance
for their support in the coming
primary. He said it would be his

men and cited his record to show
that he was not a facticnalist and
that he was not the candidate of any
man or set of men, that he was running
on his own initiative and on his
merits.
He spoke of the freedom of the
ballot and admomsnea tne T ,iers 10
vote as they saw fit and p. ,per.
Mr. 'Workman said lie would not
discuss the personal or priv. te affairs
of Mr. Johnstone, but that he
would discuss .Mr. Johnstone's official
record with fairness and in the open
where Mr. Johnstone would have an
opportunity to answer back. He, too,
had a public record whfch Mr. Johnstone
was at liber' ' j criticize, but
he hoped Mr-. Johnston would do se
fairly and that Mr. Johnstone would
not attempt to discuss his (Workman's)
private or personal affairs.
He said that if iMr. Johnstone should

had a reputation of being fully atole
to take care of himself.
In his platform lie said he was in
favor of a reformed tax system, but
voted against the tax commission
supported by iMr. Johnstone.
He gave his views on the publia
school system; and criticized Mr.
Johnstone as an advocate of compulsory.
education.
He said he was in favor of the
farmers' warehouse system and believed
the farmers wanted it, but Mr.
Johnstone had voted against the system
in every session of th" legislature
sinpe 1914.
In the last legislature Mr. Workman
said he voted against a bill to
abolish the State warehouse system
and that Mr. Johnstone voted fot the

The chairman calling time on him
Mr. Workman said that he was only
about one-third through with his
speech and concluded by referring to
the Sam Nance incident and roundly
denounced the appointment of negroes
to office in any capacity.
W. B. Bolnesi.
The candidates' for the house of
representatives then spoKe, Mr. w.
!B. Boinest being ,the first speaker.
Mr. Boinest said that after his friends
had succeeded in persuading him to
run he began to think of the common
school system and the great disparity
between the amounts of money appropriated
for State colleges and tlia
rural schools. He said that when the
legislature met the representatives of
these higher institutions of learning
would floet to Columbia and influence
legislation in their behalf, but. that
nobody goes to Columbia in the interest
of tlie common schools.
He favored a lower rate of interest
Vid be-ennial sessions of the legislature.
T. l4. Domlnick.
Mr. T. A. Dominick, the next speaker,
said he had not been brought out
as a factional candidate but was running
on his merits. He spoke of his
past life as a jfarmer and could appreciate
the needs of the farmers. He
graduated from Newberry college in
lS9f> and had been a merchant in
Prosperity for 14 years.
Mr. Dominick said he 6tood for law
and order on all occasions, for liberty,
freedom, equality and for service
to the people whom he wished to represent
He admonished the voters to

lay aside factionalism and work for
peace and prosperity. He was in
favor of greater appropriations for

He spoke of the education of the

He was not trying to find fault witfi
