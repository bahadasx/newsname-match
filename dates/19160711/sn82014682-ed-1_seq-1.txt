"The cable says that the militia bu

STUART SAID IT
Not Ready to Berieve Off-hand
in Circuit Judge's Famous
Letter to Wilson
BUT HE RAPS GREGPRY AND
LANE UPON APPOINTMENTS
Criticizes Selection of Officials
On Ground They're Not
Democrats
If Circuit Judge Thomas B. Stuart
ever falls into line for the Hail
governorsnip, ne win nave tne unaiv
ided support and assistance of the so-
called McCandless-Wuson faction of
the local Democratic party, L. I Mc-
Candless, leader of the4 faction, de
clared today. ' '
But this does not necessarily mean,
McCandless added, that the "Bour
bons of Pauahi. street" are in accord
with Judge Stuart in the attack which
he has made on President Wilson,
Attorney-general Gregory and Secre
tary of the Interior Lane, nor does it
mean that they are supporting his at
tack.
McCandless Intimated in the inter
view that he is not wholly inclined to
believe that Stuart's attack is as se
rious as many believe It to be.
TersonallyJ said McCandless, "I
think that anything unfair which it
has been reported Stuart 'said against
the president should be taken with a
grain of salt unless ft comes from
Stuart himself."
McCandless added that he recently
received a letter from Judge Stuart.
in which ho Iriehtion was made of the
president, or the Judge's attack on
the chief executive and other high
government officials.
'Judge Stuart went with us to see
the ores id en t while we were In Wash
ington,1 andHolfr'inrtef'inred him
very much; his manner and presence,
McCandless continued.
Our faction of the party is not
necessarily supporting what Judge
Stuart says. The faction is friendly
to the Wilson administration. The ac
tion of out delegates at the conven
tion will show that We feel that he
should and will be reelected.
McCandless. however, did not ex
press the same friendly feeling toward
Gregory; and Lane.'
"I do not think that Lane has treat
ed Hawaii as we should be treated,"
be declared, "and had I been the attor
ney-general, I would never have ap
ppinted'ftepufclicahs to responsible po
sitions in Hawaii.
This does not mean that I am
either, friendly or unfriendly to Lane
or Gregory, but I do not believe the
atter should have appointed Repub
licans. And the same applies to
Lane."
McCandless declared that he did
not think " there could ever be as
tabid a ; RepuBIican" in Hawaii as
the present governor. "But,'"he add
6 ?1 am not inclined to . believe the
reports of Judge Stuart's attacks until
I have it direct from Judge Stuart him
self:' ! He emphasized the statement that
fys 'bat Ms not In the ring" for the
governorship, but declared that he
wanted to see a Democrat In office as
overnor:
"And I told them this in Washing
ton,", he added. 'This Is our Inning,
! ' - aa - . .U A
ana 'wny snouia we noi nave wb
gdes with it? During the last admin
istration, how long did it take me
Republicans to clean out every' Demo
crat in oce? Just about two weeks."
He declared that, with the anticipat
ed reelection of Wilson, the Demo
crats hope tp see a change in the gov
ernorship.
If, I "was offered, the position, I
would accept it," he aaid. "But I have
made no application for the office'. We
have plenty of, Democrats In Hawa,ii
Who are qualified for office, and we
want them appointed." ,
DofsiiMnir oiraln in .Tildes Stliart'fl
attack McCandless declined tp state
Whether or not Stnart's attack on the
president and others, as in despatches
rom wasmngton puDiisnea m ine
Star-Buljetin, some tjm.e ago, is meet
ing with favor by tne , Fauant street
BpurUms."
"I do not care to pass judgment
on things which I do not know have
happened," he laughed.
He added that members of the Mc-
andless-Wilson wing in Hawaii, as
Well as certain persons in authority
in, Washington, have expressed them
selves. as being pleased with Judge
Stuart's work on the local bench.
'"Judge "Stuart may ccme back to
Hawaii." McCandless concluded, "but i
it. will not be as circuit judge.
