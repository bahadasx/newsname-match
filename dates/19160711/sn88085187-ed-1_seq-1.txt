THE TIMES IS FOR WILSON
C. The Times has reached the conclusion that Woodrow Wilson should be reelected as president.
C No man can fill that office for four of the most
critical years of its history without having, little by
little, in spite of over-praise, in spite of undeserved
criticism, in spite of himself even, shown the country
what he is.
CSo today, down deep in the hearts of the people,
when they shut their eyes for a moment to campaign
misrepresentation, is found confidence in Woodrow
Wilson, the man.
CBecause he has an unusual gift of expressing what
most Americans feel and believe but cannot say, his

strikebreakers and strikers
at 7 o'clock this morning
in-iii- the I'm itir C«ld Storage

Three strikebreakers were ar
rested and later released by Chief
of Police Faekler. Fackler told
reporters "he had their names on
a Blip of paper but had lost the
paper."
Carrying badges which said
they were "Northern Pacific spe
cial officers," and armed with re
volvers, the strikebreakers were
proceeding from the Oriental
dock, when they were approached
by 20 or-40 pickets of the lon-,
shoremen's union, led by Costallo,
a member of the strike commit
tee, who attempted to argue with
the strikebreakers.
The strikebreakers took to
their heels. When they had run
to a point near the cold storage
plant three of them made a stand,
drawing knives and revolvers.
They put up a fight while the
others continued to run.
One N. IV B|M><-ial Officer.
Police guards immediately sur
rounded some of the fighters and
arrested three strikebreakers.
.Costello's arm was cut to the
bone. He told the police a strike
breaker tried to stab him in the
neck and that he sustained the
wound when he raised his arm to
defend himself.
One of the three men who drew
weapons, he said, was a North

other two were strikebreaker!!

Mabel Abbott Tells What
Vaudeville Performance
Looks Like From Behind
By Mabel Abbott
The "point of view" is ev
erything
I saw iin- new hill at the
Puntagex Ittitt nijilii. Many of
you saw it, too. The house
was well filled.
Hut though you and I wore
looking nt (he same show lit
the same time, we saw two
utterly different shows. Our
points of view were differ
ent.
You were "In front" —a dim,
double-decked slope of faces ris
ing from orchestra to roof. I was
"behind" —as insignificant yet rs
bothersome as a grain of dust tn
the works of a watch.
Vaudeville from behind the
scenes Is characteristically unlike
"the legitimate."
An ait like that of the Al Go
lem company with its 15 men :md
women, Its gorgeous costumes,
properties and acroliatic appara
tus, takes up more room itself
than the average play.
The dusty space behind and at
the sides of the stage is .lammed
with velvet carpets, balancing |
poles, piles of embroidered and
spangled garments, the whlte
'fininifd barrels of the Jumping
Jacks, the tables and chairs of the
drawing-room sketch, the organ
which is to play its part in the
Christmas eve story, and all the
other paraphernalia of six dis
tinct performances.
And through, under, over and
around the weird collection,
swarm men and girls in tights,
frock-coated gentlemen, a clown,
an imitation policeman, women
in elaborate evening dress, and a
king in his royal robes.
There j^ really no confusion.
The properties are just where the
players will know where to lay
hands on them Instantly; the neo
ple are not wandering alnleasly
around, but going to definite
places to do definite things nt
definite moments. An outsider is
like a monkey-wrench in the ma
chinery.
But they are a gentle,
kindly lot, the«e vaudevll-
Inins, as I xaw them last
niulii. They smiled when
tJiey tripped over my feet as
tliey hurried to their en
trance*. They said "Kxcuse
me" when they found me sit
ting on the things they must
have in*i miilj.
AND THEN THEY TORB
"ON," AND YOU SAW THEM.
You saw Mabel Harper, "the
nut," swaggering up and down
the stage and doing one wild
thing after another to make you
laugh - and succeeding.
I saw her In her stuffy lIHle
dressing room, with a toothache.
She and her partner, Mac Weber,
were sharing a bag of cherries
sympathetically donated by one of
the Brown-Fletcher trio, while
another raced off to get her some
medicine.

quarreling frantically and fun
nily in their canvas-walk'd draw

1 saw them peeping at you from
the wings and wondering wheth
er you were going to be "deid,"
or responsive.
You saw Joe Roberts tied In a
hard knot over his banjo, !ils
whole soul thrown Into the task
of doing things with It that ..<>
banjo is supposed to be capable
of.
I saw him slipping quietly away
afterwards, as unnoticed as If he
had done nothing at all.
You saw Dopey Hogan and the
police officer and the nillllonai'-o
on Christmas Eve. 1 saw them
on a work-day and I know that
millionaires, policemen and
"dopeys' are all just plain m> v,
dressed differently.

I saw them with their
lanky i:l-year-old hoy, as tall

his father. Rose Is "breuK

the intervals between acts.
And Kills waits, with a ta
blet-loth tied over her over
all*, where the boy can run
over iM'i'ii-iniinll} and kl«s
her black and white clown
face.
You saw the supple-limbed
men, girls and midgets of the Al
Golem troupe doing snperhu
n.an things so easily that you
hardly realized how superhuman
they were.
I saw them as they leaped into
the wings after each act, the
stage smile gone, the sweat stand
ing In beads on their painted
faces.
One of the girls made a gesture
of pain, as she stood waiting for
her next entrance.
"Your heart?" 1 asked, alarm
ed.
She lifted her heavy lids jnd
turned her slumbrous eyes on me.
"No," she said, simply. "I ant
a piece of sheese."
The next second she turned
half a dozen flip-flops across the
stage.
And you applauded.

WAUKKGAN, 111., July 11. —
"The girl Orpet had loved in June
he hated in December. She stood,
as he viewed it across the path

Attacking Will H. Orpet as a
"selfish and callous youth," Pros
ecutor E. M. Runyard sought to
break down the defense's conten
tion that no motive had been
shown for the murder of young
Marian Lambert.
Orpet, who has been under fire
for a month, evidently had grown
used to the bitter attacks made on
him, for he remained i. lmly in
his chair during the long summing
up of the prosecution's case.
Attorney Runyard, who during
the evidence has bt«n a silent
member of the prosecution's
force, tried to convince the jury
that Orpet'a real motive was to bo
found In the fact that the expos
ure of Marian's condition meant
exposure of Orpet, the finish of
his career at the university, the
breaking of his engagement to
Celestla Youker, and strained re
lations with his parents.

NKW YORK, July 11.— Despite
prodigious efforts to curb the iii
fantile paralysis* epidemic, reports
today showed an increase of 100

facing one of the most serious
problems in the history of the
