There has been some criticism of

after the guardsmen were called out,
that the bylaws of the fraternity
barred payment of death benefits to
members who lost their lives in war
urtless the premiums required in haz

However, the executive council has
removed this objection, as the fol

Des Moines Fhysicians Tell How To
Safeguard Babies in Case
of Attacks.
Des Moines, July 10.—Des MoineB
has not had a single case of infan
tile paralysis reported. The best way
to continue this record, or to confine
the disease to one case, if it should
appear, is to isolate sick children
and call a physician whether the
case seems a serious illness or not.
Several Des iMolnes physicians
discussed the present epidemic, today.
Dr. Lenna Meanes suggested a course
of action locally. She said:
"If a child has a -fever that may
be indigestion or summer bowel
trouble or any of the less harmless
contagious or infectious diseases,
isolate him at once and call a phy
sician. It isn't always necessary to
do that when a mother knows how
to treat a child for minor illness, but
in view of this cpidemic of infantile
paralysis, it is the safe thing to do.
In a few days, a physician can tell
whether it is infantile paralysis. The
paralysis shows up in two or three
days after the fever develops. Pre
vious to that the disease seems about
like any one of several children's
diseases. That 1b why It is difficult
to control.
"I am wondering about how the
disease is Bpread. The scientists
think it is spread by the saliva from
the mouth and the discharge from
the nose. If that Is true, I cannot
see why it cannot di'y and blow
about in the dust'."
When asked to discuss infantile
paralysis, Dr. Charles Smith, mem
ber of the school board, said:
"It is not a new disease. Well
informed physicians have known
about it for many years. It docB
seem to be more prevalent now than
formerly, but even that may seem
to be true merely hecausc we are
making greater efforts to combat it.
The scientists are working day and
night to discover its origin and a
cure. There is no cure now. All
we can do is try- to Isolate it and
prevent its spread.
"A great many of the cripples you
see these days with a withered limb
are victims of infantile paralysis.
There Just simply wasn't as general
a knowledge abottt-the disease then
V:
HWwIaal D«erlman|
/'•l*y
as now.
"The disease looks and acts like
typhoid fever in the start. Until the
paralysis develops there is no way
of telling any difference between the
diseases. When I was a medical stu
dent one case came under my ob
servation. A cousin of mine was at
tacked by the disease and I watched
the case closely. The disease is not
confined to children you know, al
though it is much more common in
children.
"Rest and massage are the only
things that will combat the disease
in any way, so far as is known. They
will relieve the patient to some ex
tent.
"Yes, if the disease has always
been as prevalent as now, it would
seem as if there would be even more
cripples In the world than there are
Still you must remember that from
25 to 30 per cent of the cases are
fatal. Then many of those not fatal
immediately, arc so weakened that
they arc susceptible to, other diseases
and die later."

Rev. Norsted, Head of Fine Group of
Twenty-five Boys, Recently
Organized.
nit
The Boy Scouts of Jewell, but two
months organised, under the direc
tion of Rev. Norsted, pastor of the
Norwegian Lutheran church of that
place, have just received a handsome
gift of $1000 from a former Jewell
resident—Mrs. Carrie Strong, who
is now a resident of California, liv
ing near Sacramento. She is well
known by many Webster City peo
pie.
Mrs. Strong is a lady of more Slum
80 years but has an interest in life
that is perennial, as Is evidenced by
her deep Interest in the work of the
boy scouts of America. She has been
a Red Cross nurse for a number of
years, having been actively engaged
in Luzon, Philippine Islands, as well
as In Porto Rico. Returning to
Jewell for a visit she found a small
organization of about twenty-five
boys under the very efficient leader
ship of the minister, struggling
along without proper equipment.
Forthwith she gave them $1000 to
be used for a building, providing
they were able to find the ground.
They have been able to obtain an
acre or two in the outskirts of the
town upon which they will at once
erect a long one story frame build
ing with board floor. Upon the lot
they also expect to construct a con
crete swimming pool. The building
and its equipment will be ready for
occupancy by winter.
Saturday the members of the
Jewell Scout Council, accompanied
by several of the Jewell ladles, came
to this city to consult Scoutmaster
Murray McMurray, who for several
years has been the head of the scout
troop in Webster. City. They were
taken to the third floor of the south
school building where they were
shown the various collection cabi
nets, the gymnastic apparatus and
other possessions of the boys.
They were able to obtain valuable
suggestions for the equipment of
their building. Those present in the
city were Mrs. Strong, Rev. Norsted,
Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert Knudson, Mrs.
Wm. Anderson, Claude V. Campbell,
C. P. Miller, W. K. Jackson. B. C.
Hanson, Dr. Slfeter.
That such a gift might be the
good fortune of the Webster City
troop some time in the future, will
f.o hoped by all who are interested
fn the work of the boys of this city.
A building is not needed, but the
equipment of fhe scout hall could
materially be added to.
Make Trip on Shriner Train.
Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Young left
Friday on a two or three weeks
visit among relatives and friends at
their old home in Lamoine, Maine.
They went to Des Moines where they
boarded the Shriner train which left
there next morning for Buffalo. New
York, carrying members of 7.a Ga
Zig Temple of the capital city and
Kaaba Temple of Davenport. A
Shriner band of fifty pieces will ac
company the train. The annual
convention of Shriners will be held
in Buffalo for three days and Mr.
and Mrs. Young expect to remain
there a couple of days before resum
ing their journey to Maine.

YOU CAN DO SOMETHING NOW
How to Make This Important Article
—It Costs little for Material
and Contents.
Seventy soldier boys out of Com
pany C, and e5ght members of the
Second Regiment band which also
went from thisv city who are now at
Camp Dodge, have no Comfort Kits
in which to keep their toilet artio^es
and to which to go when a button
comes off of there is need for a nee
dle.
1
Through its correspondent, Regin
ald Gilmore, the Freeman-Tribune
has ascertained, the exact number of
kits needed aitd also the name of
each soldier I'oy who has none.
Many of the w^men and girls of the
city have at ti(yes expressed a desire
to personally "do something" for the
boys of Company C. Now is the
chance for theifa. There are women
and girls enough in Webster City
that no soldier( boy, in this town of
about 2,000 Women who are old
enough to use a needle, need to go
without one to the border.
Each woman'desiring to make and
equip a kit for a soldier is hereby re
quested to choose one 'of the names
below and tslsfcltene her dfecisioo to
No. 35 or 697 so that each boy may
with certainty be provided for. No
great expense need be attached to
the making of a kit and yet the con
venience may be practical and use
ful and not bulky.
Some of the boys in the list of
names below, have no friends or rel
atives in thi3 city. They will not be
apt to have a comfort kit unless
some Webster City woman makes one
for him. Who wants to "adopt" a
soldier hoy for the time Being?
A comfort kit which haB been
made for one of the privates of the
company is exactly the thing needed
and has been greatly admired by the
boys who have none. Some woman
may want to make two kits and may
take two names. As soon as a name
is taken a cross will be made on the
list at this office beside the name,
and later proper directions for mail
ing them will be furnished. The
comfort kit referred to is made as
follows: One-third of a yard of
black oil cloth witrh edges unbound,
Is turned up lengthwise half way up
the width this turned section Is
then stitched into a multitude of
pockets, each of which may be label
led with ink just above them on the
white inner surface of the cloth.
Pockets should be made for the fol
lowing articles and the articles plac
ed therein: Small flat comb, flat
shaving soap, pocket for razor, scis
sors, toothpaste. No. 36 black and
white thread each rolled onto a flat
card, for no spool of thread may be
carried paper of assorted needles,
•bachelor" buttons black and white,
which may .he procured at any cloth
ing store, box talcun^ powder, small
box witch-hazel salve, tooth brilsh.
hand soap, small roll antiseptic
gauze, fiat box court plaster, flat box
adhesive plaster, darning cotton,
safety pins.
Care should be taken to make the
kit as light and easy to handle as
possible as there is just a certain
amount of room In a soldier's knap
sack.
The following is the list of boys
in company who have no comfort
kits:

FORD HI COLLIDE
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Stafford Ar
rive in City After Varied
Experiences.
From Saturday's Daily:
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Stafford and
two children of Burlington are in the
city, the two former having arrived
a day or so ago for a visit at the G.
C. Stafford and Mrs. Maggie Wood
all homes, after several varied exper
lencep. The children, aged about
eleven and eight years, were placed
on the train at Burlington, Satur
day, July 1st, with tickets for Web
ster City, and a few hours l^ter the
parents started on a motorcydle trip
to this city, expecting to take the
trip by easy stages.
On Monday afternoon, July 3rd,
as Mr. and Mrs. Stafford were about
six miles from Grinnell, they were
struck by a Ford car, the driver of
which says he did not see the ap
proaching motorcycle. The driver
was a liveryman from Malcolm, a
little town nearby, and was on the
wrong side of the road. Both ma
chines were going at a slow rate of
speed or the accident would have re
sulted in casualties without doubt.
As it was the Ford struck the motor
cyle squarely, throwing Mrs. Staf
ford some distance and pinning her
husband under the handlebars, tear
ing the flesh and bruising him se
verely. Physicians were summoned
at once and for a sliort time it was
feared Mrs. Stafford's back was
broken, but she seem3 to have sus
tained only nervous shock and bad
bruises.
After the liveryman was convinc
ed that the accident was his own
fault, he took the couple to Malcolm
to a hotel where they received good
care until the following day, when
they were able to go to Des Moines
for a short stay with relatives be
fore coming to this city.
The motorcycle, which was badly
wrecked, was taken to Grinnell
where it now is in a repair shop. Mr.
Stafford expects to go after the ma
chine Monday it he is well enough
by that time. The children arrived
in the city In good time and until
their parents' arrived, were in Ignor
ance of the accident and the latter's
narrow escape.

Grandson of Mr. and Mrs. Thos.
Bonebright Writes From
Camp Dodge.
The following brief letter has just
been received by relatives here from
the soldiers' camp at Des Moines:
Camp Dodge, July S.—Helio
Folks: I have only a little time to
write. Was out on an extended drill
order this morning, and it is hotter
than anything here today. Have been
working in the regimental store, and
therefore haven't, drilled -but twice
since I came to cainp. Was appoint
ed corporal yesterday. Have a chance
to go into the supply department
under Captain- Smith, and if I get
that will rank as sergeant. We all
have requisitions for clothing, but
haven't received anything yet, except
a few shoes. Expect to get things
about the first of the week.
Al. and Pearl Brock are here, and
I just had a fine big feed. Chicken
from home tastes mighty good. If
my stomach felt as well all summer
as it does right now, I believe I
would be too goodnatured to fight.
I received the money O. K. a few
days ago. Thanks it will come In
pretty handy, as we haven't been
paid yet. The muster rolls are not
finished and we can't find out when
the pay-wagon will show up.
I did a big washing yesterday, and
am finding out things. Sent you a
card the first of the week, and will
write more later.

Frank Singer of Chicago, Who is
Visiting Ed Miller at Frairie
Queen, Injured.
While carrying a bucketful of
boiling hot water for washing pur
poses, Frank Singer of Chicago, tho
thirteen year old nephew of Mr. and
Mrs. Ed Miller, who is visiting at
the Miller home in the Prairie Queen
neighborhood, sustained terrible
burns which may result in perma
nent disability after much intense
suffering. The lad was carrying a
large bucketful of boiling hot water,
early yesterday morning, which was
to be used for washing, when a dog
ran between his legs, causing the
pail to upset and spilling the water
over the lad's right arm from his
shoulder to the tips of his fingers, a
portion of his chest and the upper
part of his right leg. Mrs. Singer
immediately brought the lad to a
Webster City physician who found
the flesh badly burned. Burns from
scalding water are always serious
and how badly the injury may affect
the boys cannot yet be determined.
