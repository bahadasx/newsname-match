co, said that General Pershing's
headquarters are nearly one hun
dred miles north of the Hearst
Ranch at Babicora, reported tak

was taken as an Intimation that
the first of the expeditionary

within the next few days. It was
pointed out that a point one hun
dred miles north of Babicora
Ranch would lie . about sixty
miles south of the American fron

EL PASO. July 10. Mexican offi
cials in Juarez today frankly express
ed themselves as pizled at the re

are headed for the Big Bend district
of Teras, given the American state
department by Eliseo Arrendondo,
Mexican ambassador designate.
The last reports from the defacto
troops operating against the outlaws
under Calixto Contreras, southwest of
Jiminez, indicated that the Villistas
were retreating in an opposite direc
tion, toward the mountains of Duran
go, according to General Francisco
Gonzales, and Andres Garcia, Mexi
can consul at EI Paso.
This band, they said, is, so far as
they know, the only one of any size
now operating In northern Mexico.
For it to reach the border in the Big
Bend district, a march of nearly two
hundred miles acrow a desert in
which water holes are very few,
would be necessary, they pointed out.
