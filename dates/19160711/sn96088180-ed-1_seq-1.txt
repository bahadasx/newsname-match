Washington, July 11. England
and France will do : everything In
their power to prevent the United
States recognising the auper
submersible Deutschland as a ship of
commerce, and to prevent the opera
tion of a line of submarine freight
carriers proposed by the ; North
German-Lloyd Steamship company.
This was admitted at the embassies
of the two governments today.-
The British embassy today correct
ed, published reports that it was not
actively trying to oppose the peace
ful stay of the Deutschland. Any
submarine, the embassy said, is po
tentially a warship and any ship at
sea would be unable to determine un
til too late to save itself whether a
submarine was armed. This fact,
alone, would prevent recognition of a
submarine as a possible merchant
man, according to the embassy's view.
These facts, it was learned, have been
pointed out to Acting Secretary ot
State Polk by Counselor Barckley,
acting charge d'affaires of the em
bassy. .
Questions not only of the Deutsch
land's status as a warship or a mer
chantman, but as to her cargo and
the cargo she will take 'back to Ger
many with her are to be taken up
by the British embassy with the state
department.
The tact that the Deutschland's
home going cargo Is expected to con
tain nickel alone may cause a num
ber of complications, it was learned.
This may cause sweeping embargoes
on any sort of goods from Canada or
Great Britain to this country which
might be Imported to Germany by
the Detuschland or other commercial
submarines which are reported an
their way to the United States. Nine
ty per, cent of the nickel used in this
country comes from Canada.
