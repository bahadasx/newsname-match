HARDECOURT CAPTURED
By the British on the West
ern Front Lull at,
Verdunr
London, July 10. Tho Eastern
front continues to overshadow the
Western front from the spectacular
viewpoint, the Russian forces going
from success to success. Not only
Gen. Tetchitzky in the South occupied
therailroad junction at Delatyn, west
of Kolomea, thus cutting off Gen. Von
Bothmer from his supply base, but
Gen. Brussilloff in the North is mak
ing surprising advances on both sides
of the Kovel railway toward the Stok
hod river.
Russian communications report the
enemy forces in this region retiring
in great disorder and add that the
Russians have occupied Huteviche,
whfch is 24 miles to the east of Kovel,
while apparently the Russians are al
ready across the Stokhod river some
where in the region of Janovka.
German nossession of Barannviohi
and Kovel are absolutely essential if
she is to retain her hold over the in
vaded parts of Poland and Lithuania,
but it is considered likely that it is
only 'a" matter of feWdays before the
Russians will be in possession of!
Kovel, which would compel Gen
Linsingen's retirement from the Lutsk
salient.

First Division of Race Proves
Successful; Teams to Be
Strengthened.
President Frank Bassett has decid
ed to divide the Kitty league race into
two halves, making the first division
of tho race end with Sunday's games.
The second season starts today. The
reason for making two separate di
visions in tho race is in order that the
teams getting off bad in the first race
can issue a call for recruits and
strengthen their ranks enough to put
them in the running the second sea
son.
Tho leaeue season has been consid
ered absolutely successful and none
of the teams in tho league want to re
tire from their places. The amateur
restrictions put on the league by ur.
Bassett have made tho teams become
well balanced and the plan has work
ed wonders.
For the second season all the teams
will bo strengthened. Many had
players to leave with tho Kentucky
National Guards and others have al
lowed their ranks to become ragged
in other ways. All the cities in the
circuit will get new men to liven up
the personnel of their squads.
Hopkinsville intends to put in
its appearance for the second
season with practically a new
team. The efforts to get Bill Schwartz
for manager was successful. Schwartz
has been offered a place as umpire, in
the Southern League but he prefered
to accept the place with the Hoppers
which will allow him to stay in the
game.

back. They will now be open all tho
time to transients and everybody who
wants meals, rooms or both.

at the side. The spacious diningroom,
with nine tables, is also on the first
floor.

dishes, tables, waiters and all the din
ing room paraphernalia had their first
trial at breakfast. Everything worked
splendidly and the guests who were
at the meal were all delighted.

rooms. Thev are all newly furnished

people of Hopkinsville visit it and go
through the rooms before they were
opened up to the public. Between
five and six hundred persons accepted
his invitation and visited the hotel
during the evening. An orchestra
furnished music and refreshments
were served.

ent proprietor. He is anxious to please
his patrons and hasjhad many years
of experience in hotel work. He had
full charge of the Henry Watterson
Hotel; in Louisville, at night for
several years. He has been connected
with the Tyler Hotel, at Louisville and
the Hillman and Morris Hotels of
Birmingham, Ala.
Mr. Tyler said this morning that it
was not his purpose to enter into
competition with the hotels which
were already established in Hopkins
ville, but that he believed the growing
conditions of the city made an urgent
need for such a hotel as tho Hotel
Main promises to be.
