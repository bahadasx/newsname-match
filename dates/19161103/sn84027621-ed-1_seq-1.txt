SHOULD ROPE OFF THE STREETS
Whenever the street force oils a
street, it should be roped off until the
oil is sanded. One of our citizens ran
a fine auto into an oiled stretch of
street on Oklawaha avenue the other
night. The oil had been poured on
half the street,-but it was not roped
cff, lit nor guarded in any way. The
car skidded, broke its fender and a
lamp and did other damage amount
ing to several dollars; also the newly
cleaned car was fouled with the oil,
and the wheels were soaked with it to
the possible great damage of the tires.
The oil. is useful, but it is mighty
nasty stuff to get on one's feet, clothes
and cars, and the street force should
take precautions against such things
happening.

Second Florida Regiment Has Plenty
of Strenuous Practice at
Soldiering
(Special to the Star)
Laredo, Texas, Oct. 30. The fol
lowing is a summary of the week's
doings of the Second Florida regi
ment. Monday a sham battle, two miles
east of Laredo.
Tuesday the regiment made an' all
day scouting trip, scouting over the
hills, pitching "dog" tents at noon.
Dinner was served in the field.
Wednesday was another one of
those twelve-mile hikes over rock cov
ered hills and thru clouds of alkali.
Knott Elected Governor .
Sunday was election day in the Sec
ond Florida - A straw vote was taken
by Sergeant Asher Frank of Co. H,
Tampa. There are many Cat( ts )
here, but for every (Cat(t) there was
a Knott. When the battle of votes
was over there were 39 more Knott
votes than there were for Catts.
Owing to the fact that Co. A has a
large delegation of Cattsites from
Oxford, Co A gave Catts a majority
of 14 votes. The soldier boys are
Knott for Catts. As these Catts have
only one life they will be harmless
on Nov. 7.
To prevent Mexicans from running
quarantine and bringing cattle, into
this country without duty, Co. A has
been stationed at Indian Ford, several
miles from Laredo.
Monday the First and Second bat
talions of the Second Florida go on
border patrol. They will be out two
weeks. The boys are all anxious for
some, real soldiering, being very tired
of this close camp life, tho there is no
dearth of excitement down here, as
there are plenty of horned toads,
snakes and -cactus. Everything here
has horns even the trees.
The Second Florida band of Palat
ka, under the leadership of Prof. J.
W. Chattaway, gave a concert Thurs
day night at the plaza. A piece com
posed by Prof. Chattaway and played
at this concert made quite a hit with
the Mexicans.
Col. Slocum is quoted as saying,
"The Second Florida is the best band
on the border." Chas. G. Woods.
