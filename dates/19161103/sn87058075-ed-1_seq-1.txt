Irish Terrier Sounds Warning Horn in
Automobile.
Mr. Fiske O'Hara, the popular actor
singer and Irish star, who comes to
the Cresco, Saturday, Nov 11, in "His
Heart's Desire," is the proud posies
sor of a little Irish terrior answering
to the name of Con, which he received
from a friend in Ireland, when he was
motoring through there four years ago.
Con's recommendation was, "He
will do anything except eat meat on
Friday." Con took to his new master
from the start and sat out his first
motor ride like a veteran, He very
shortly understood the language of
Toot! Toot! and in Mr. O'Hara's new
racing car there is a special horn with
silk cord attached which Con pulls
with his teeth, to his great delight,
when an object appears in the way.
Con has lived up to the character given
him by his former master, by showing
wonderful intelligence, which at times
to say the least, is remarkable, espec
ially in regard to the motor car. Con
walks around the car with an air of
authority before taking his seat. One
evening he let up a terrible yelp and no
coaxing on on the part of Mr. O'Haia
could persuade him to enter. Just then
an officer came along and drew the
actor-singer's attention that the
light was out. Con loves children and
and is a daily visitor to a family living
near the actor's home. The lady came
over one afternoon to Mr. O'Hara in
great haste, "Poor Con is so sick, he
wouldn't eat a morsel today and 1 Rave
him a little steak which I cooked es
pecially." What! Con sick! he ate
the heartiest meal he ever did today,"
Mr. O'Hara, adding, "perhaps you are
not aware that Con keeps Fridays. It
is a most remarkable thing that no
amount of persusion can make Con eat
meat on Friday, and the lady proved it
to her own satisfaction the following
week as she said herself, "Con just
sniffed, turfed up his nose, and walked
off with anlkr of 'you can't fool the
Irish'".

A Good Lecture.
The writer had the pleasure of list
ening to the lecture recently given by
Peter Collins, but overlooked mention
ing it in our last issue. In spite of the
rainy night, the opera house was com
fortably filled by people of all denomir
nations and they were rewarded by
hearing a most instructive and inspire
ing address in which "harmony" was
the keynote throughout—harmony in
the home, in the state, the nation and
the world, harmony between labor and
capital and harmony among those oif
different religious beliefs.
Mr. Collins is primarily a laboring
man—an electrician—but has been
specially favored by nature with a
brilliant intellect and the arts of an
orator, but as a laboring man hits at
socialism an an attack on the home and
rear religion, stating that ft did .not origi-
nate with the people but with aristo
cratic philosophers. Should Mr. Col
lins again visit Cresco, he will surely
meet with a large audience for all we& I cation
impressed with the ability, the fair
ness and the earnestness of the man.

VOL. LVHI, NO. 11 CRESCO, HOWARD COUNTY, IOWA, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER, 3 1916 $1.00 PER YEARS'
We have just received another large shipment of Cloaks from both of our cloak houses The "Printzess and
The
To the Voters of Howard County.
1 desire to be elected to the office of
County Recorder solely upon the con
fidence of the voters in my ability and
personal qualifications to protect their
interests as I would my own.
I fully appreciate the fact that you
want to cast your vote to elect a man
to this important office who can and
will discharge its duties with accuracy
and promptness, and with credit to you
and your county. I much regret that
it may be impossible for me to meet
you personally before election, on ac
count of operating a threshing rig, be
sides my farm work, and therefore
take this method of meeting you and
making your acquaintance.
As above stated, I earnestly desire
to be elected, and therefore realize the
necessity of fully informing you as to
my qualifications, personal character,
etc., to fill the office, so that you may
intelligently determine to your own
satisfaction that I am in every way
qualified and worthy the confidence that
you may see fit to repose in me.
With this as my sole object, I wish
to say, that I am a son of Mr. and
Mrs. P. M. Herold, old residents of the
county. I was born in New Oregon
township 28 years ago. I was educated
iu the Public schools of the county, and
gained a business education in the Oel
wein Business University. In addition
to this^ I also received a German edu-
Garments. In this assortment both makers have made special efforts to send us the very latest
Coats in styles and colors. You need not feel, because you have not yet purchased your Cloak fof" this winter, that
you won't find just what you want and that you will have to take what is left, fcr you won't have tci a
We are just as well prepared to-day to show you what you would like in a Cloak as we have been at any time"3
of the season, and we are just waiting for the opportunity to present itself to us, so that we can demonstrate to you
that this is so. We have good, stylish Cloaks to show you at from $15.00 up.
While most of my life has been
spent in farming, and at present -on
the farm, my business training has been
put to practical use by over two years
office work in St Paul and in the em
ploy of the former Implement Firm of
Woods, Schneider & Herold.
I am free to say to you, that if I am
elected it will be without personal ob
ligation to any pne man, but an ever
lasting obligation to all voters in this
county to fulfill the duties of this im
portant office to the. very best of my
ability, and I assure you that whatever
influence you may extend in my behalf,
will be rewarded by strict and personal
Attention to the work of the office.
May I receive your vote and support?
Yours very truly,
V, Hnwt L. HBROLD.

Alone Witlj Your Conscience.
Mr. Voter, you are to choose wheth
er you will go forward with Wilson—
who
Kept you out of war
Prepared you against war
Worked for you and yours
Ended Wall Street's rule
Liberated honest business
Made lasting prosperity possible
Kept faith with labor
Lifted the farmer's mortgage
Freed the child
Kept all his promises
OR
Undo Wilson's deeds, go backward
with the candidate of the Old Guard
and Wall Street, and take a chance on
plunging us into war with Roosevelt
and Hughes?
You are working instead of fighting.
WILSON'S THE MAN.
Making a Winning Campaign.
Carl Evans, the democratic candi
date for congress is making a sensa
tional campaign in this district. Carl's
friends all knew that he was thorough
ly qualified for the job, and he has
developed into a wonderful campaigner
and speaker. He spoke at Decorah
Monday night and several from Cresco
who were present report that the
Grand Opera House was packed to hear
him, it being the larjgest crowd that
has greeted a political speaker at an
indoor meeting in Decorah for years.
As a result of the impression of the
man and his ability, it is predicted that
Evans will carry the city of Decorah at
the election next Tuesday.
Ferrie Works for Hinuelf.
It has come to our knowledge that L._
J. Cameron has stated that his oppon
ent, D. J. Ferrie, is supporting Lee El
wood, the Republican candidate for
Representative. Those who are
acquainted with Mr. Ferrie know that
he attends strictly to his own business,
personal, political and official, and such
attempts to stir up trouble at this late
hour will reault in nothing but disaster
to Mr. Cameron.
