WILSON ISSUES
CALLTO ARMS
In Address at Long Branch
Charges His Enemies With
Unscrupulous Methods in
Trying to Defeat Him.
Long Branch, N. J., Oct .28.?That
the opposition to his election is "scru?
pling at nothin," in statement of fact
and policy, was the charge made by
President Wilson in a speech at Shad?
ow Lawn this afternoon to a throng
that assembled for a joint celebra?
tion of "bsew YorK Day," and "Wood
row Wilson" Day."
Renewin-? his discussion of the for
o'gn policies of the United States and
speaking of the "vocal element" of the
Republican party, the President de
cieared:
"They prefer a peace that is pro?
duced by (l.c methods of those who
defy, of those who bra" of those who
threaten in order to establish their
prowess. They have forgotten their
manners. They want u puace indeed,
but they dc not want the peace ob?
tained as gentlemen obtain it but on?
ly as braggarts obtain it."
In the course of his address the
president reviewed in detail the rec- '
qrd of the Democratic party toward
public questions, declared that most
of the issues of the campaign propos?
ed at the outset by the Republicans
have disappeared and upheld the eight
hour law.
"It has been a confusing campaign"
said the president in his address, "be?
cause the public mind has never been
permitted to center upon any single
tiling that the opposition eared to
.stund for.
They possess no stamp of definite
policy. They suggest no line of defi?
nite action. On the one hand, the vo?
cal element says that we have accom?
plished the purpose that they did have
in mind; that they desired peace, but
they do not like the way in which
peace was accomplished. They prefer
a peace that is produced by the meth?
ods of those who defy, of those who
brag, of those who thcatcn. In or?
der to establish their prowess, they
have forgotten their manners. They j
want nence indeed, but they do not >
want a peace obtained ns gentlemen ]
obtain it, but only as braggarts ob- (
tain it."
The President outlined what he j
characterized as the definite policy of ?
the Democrats, by saying:
"The only thing that those of us :
have done who have tried to lead has j
been to purge our hearts and under- I
stand what we heard, because, my j
friends, a man who tries to serve a .
free nation must try to have in his
own heart the thoughts of a free na?
tion.
Cannot Apply to All.
"If he believes that men ought to .
work eight hours only, he is expected 1
to say so; and if he is asked whether
ho means everybody, he ought to an
swer, 'yes, ever -' - ' - for whom it is
possible.' There arc somo occupa?
tions in which you cannot divide the
day up into eight-hour periods, for
the simple reason that "-? have got
to do wliat nature determines. I do
not see how, for example, a farmer
could divide the day up into periods
of eight hours, because nature does not
divide it up into periods of eight
hours, but in most occupations where
the seasons do not dominate, where
the plans of men dominate, it is pos?
sible to have eight hours and moreov?
er eight hours are more profitable to
the men who manage the capital of the
country than the longer day.
"Have you noticed the interesting
gyrations of the opposition with re?
gard to the protective tariff? It is
very interesting how they have dis?
closed their real mind about it. You
know for a long time they said this
ought not to be a matter of pnrtisan
politics. We ought to have a tariff
commission to put this upon n scien?
tific basis instead of a political foot?
ing. Very well. We gave them a tar?
iff commission. It is going to be put
upon a scientific footing and so far as
I am concerned Democratic theories
are going to have no more to do with
the facts than Republican theories.
Not Yet Satisiied.
"But that does not satisfy them.
Now that they know they are going
to have a commission they are uneasy
because they are not going to appoint
it.: Not on'y that, but they say we
cannot wait for it. We have got to
have protection on the old lines and
in the old familiar wny right away,
without waiting for the conclusions of
the commission. Are we to assume
that they dont know what thoy are
talking about?

JOHN 1). MJYING SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA COLD LANDS.
Twenty-One Thousand Acres In Rus?
sell and Buchanan Counties Fur
chased ia Recent Weeks.
A special from Norfolk, says:
Twenty-one thousand acres of land
in Russell and Buchanan counties have
been purchased within the pnst few
weeks for parties said to be repre?
senting John D. Rockefeller. Nine
thousand acres of land were pur?
chased at ?9.00 an acre and 12,000
acres were bought for $10 an ncre.
W. L. Dennis, clerk of the court of
Buchanan county and others, owners
of a vast amount of land near Dumps
Creek, were offered similar prices for
1-1,000 acres of land wanted by the
supposed Rockefeller interest but the
declined to sell at those figures.
He wanted $15 nn acre for his land
und it is reported when that was of?
fered him, he was sorry he did not
ask for more. He has not yet closed
the deal for this land, but he is ex?
pected to do so most any time.
The purpose for which the land is
wanted mystifies the residents of Rus?
sell and Buchanan counties, according
to reports received here, until it was
whispered that it contained consid?
erable coal of the duality now brought
here from West Virginia by the Nor?
folk & Western Railroad.
A Norfolk lawyer who represented
one or more of the parties purchasing
the land, declined to say who is buy?
ing it, or for what purpose it will be
used. He said there was nothing of
public interest in the matter and stat?
ed that he always made it a practice
not to divulge the names or the bus?
iness of his clients. He said, howev?
er, that Rockefeller was not inter?
ested in buying the land.

Demon That Walked With Death
Now Occupies Place in Rec?
ords on the Shelves of Time.
Revenue Not Be Missed.
(J. A. Leslie, jr., in Richmond Vir?
ginian, of October 30th.)
Virginia is going dry!
As October prepares, in these last
two days, to lay away her records on
the shelves of time, she will place
with her annals the finished history
of the life of John Barleycorn in the
Old Dominion. For the first time in
the life of Virginia she is able to say
that "day after tomorrow" liquor will
no longer be sold within her bound?
aries.
This' state of affairs has come about
after a tight that was marked by
struggles never seen before in this
country. It was more difficult because
of the fact that Virginians have boast?
ed, since the first shipload of colonists
stepped upon the snnds of a new and
untried land, that the words "mint
julep" was written in the creed of
"gentlemen" and that the flowing bowl
was a household requisite. Hence,
when those forces, which realized the
lengths of degredntion to which the
abuse of drink were carrying the
fathers and sons of the Common?
wealth, attempted to stem the tide of
evil which was threatening to engulf
and swop away the bloom of man?
hood and to undermine the founda?
tions of' efficient citizenship, they
were confronted by a frowning oppo?
sition that resented supposed encroach?
ment upon "a man's natural rights,"
Men claimed that they had a right to
drink wlint and whenever they pleased
if they bought it from a licensed and
legalized dealer. The fight was on.
Gave Much For Cause.
The story of the combat has been
written?not only in letters, which
; burn with the trinls of good men and
! women who gave the best of life to a
j cause for which they were find to
'give their nil, but it has been laid
; down in the prayers and tears of
heart-broken mothers, who have seen
their sons crucified upon a cross
j stained red with the blood of men
] throttled and torn by the hands of a
' demon that walked hand in hand with
death. It has been written unon tab?
lets dug from the ashes of homes
' crumbled and wrecked where a mis?
spent heritage turned happiness to
1 tears. It has boen transcribed from
; the henrts of wives and daughters,
I lain bare and bleeding bv ruthless
.thrusts-of an unfeelin- senseless
I thing, that demands all of life that is
i good and gives in turn a blow that
deals death to pride, that crushes
womanhood in the mire and blights
that capacity of youth thnt gives the
, zest to life
i For years the battle raged, and the
. forces thnt were aligned on the side of
'Justice, and Right and Hope, stormed
in vain the high-flung battlements
that flew the colors of the Destroyer,
i Yet all the while throughout this land
of the Old Dominion, with its unap?
proachable traditions which give it a
place on history's ?"??res never to be
over-shatlowed; with its memory of
? statesmen, the essence of thnt spirit
i which has made for all that is noble
among the congresses of men through
' out the earth; with its record of
achievement in the path of the na?
tion's growth and culture which has
placed the nam? of Virginia as a by
word on the lips of children us l\
synonym for nil that was grand and
noble, and desirable?yet all the while
I in llus Virginia, boys and men, with
all the inherent rights of unimpeach
' able nobility, the sons and wives of
I noble women, whose sacrifices made
possible the glorious strides of pro?
gress of the South since the days of
'(15 and who gave to the word "sacri?
fice" a holier tone, have fallen beneath
the feet of this Monster Destroyer,
and have been laid as evidence of a
cause that had not been won.
Prayers Answered.
Dut the prayers of good men and
of good women, the sobs of broken
lives and the piteous cries of starv?
ing children and hungry mothers could
not forever fall upon a blank, un?
heeding ear. The senses of men were
touched by the still small voice until
Ihe dawning of a beautiful day was
blown upon a sky that was hidden by
clouds hovering, dark and threaten?
ing. The prayers and elforts and un?
failing perseverance of men who hail
stood faithfully and long on the side
of Right, until the principle that,
was good triumphed in a magnificent
victory. Almost unbelievable was the
news that Virginia was going dry.
That the Stale that had harbored the
mint bed, that had nursed the baby
on a docantur, and that had continued
through all the years to fill the ceme?
teries with the young men grown old
along the gaudy path of hidden thorns
had succumbed at last to the teach?
ings of good men and had been touch?
ed by the spirit of the Nazarenc
which bathed a lonely soul upon the
cross that men might live upon the
earth.
Ends Long, Long Years.
And it isn't next week, perhaps or
next month, next year, that this tiling
is coming to pass. It is tomorrow.
Not the "tomorrow, and tomorrow,
and tomorrow" of Shakespeare, which
draws on the days into endless'time,
but a real- tomorrow that ends the
long, long years of waiting and watch?
ing beside a principle that must have
vanquished in spite of all efforts
that could have been put forth against
it. Not at some indefinite time, ko*tt
present in the minds of men and
growing nearer as the hopes grow
fresher in hearts of determined, but
now, the distance of a dr- ia this
thing to como to pass.
And, after all, it. isn't the fact that
Virginia's going dry represents a
great victory unreservedly won that,
counts so much; that it show:-, how
surely goodness and mercy must final?
ly be victor over all the end:- the dev?
il may pursue, that it is the prayer
of men and women vindicated in a
prophetic way. But it is significant,
more tenderly because it brings with
it a gentle command and a wholesome
provision that the peace and happi?
ness of home is not to be violated,
that mothers may rest content in the
knowledge that sons may fare forth
free from snares that have beguiled
them on the way, and that prosperity
may come not built on a foundation
of ravished homes and shattered forms
of broken men.
It is true that there is a revenue
a most costly revenue?derived from
the sale of liquor, which will be
missed from the coffers of the State.
-But it is also true that there will
come a revenue for flour, for shoos,
for clothes, for meats, which has not
come before. And buildings that were
used for the dispensaries of booze,
will serve as meeting places for men
vho spend their wngos for bread in
stead of poison.
Revenue Will Not Be Missed.
Prohibition takes some $195,000
from the revenue of Richmond alone,
but, prominent real estate dealers
say that in the place of the liquor
houses from which this revenue is de?
rived, in six months there will be in
every case a house of business of a
'ei'itimate nature. And Unit the re?
venue from this dissipation of human
life, used in the building of side?
walks, streets and the improvements
of the city docks, will be replaced by
revenue from the sale of food and
clothing, and the benefit to happy
homes will pay all the price there is
to pay.
Tomorrow night, at the stroke of
twelve, it is said the witches with
which legend nnd folk-stories havo
peonled all the by-ways, will walk
and whisper and enper, and thnt
spirits long departed will apnear in
form again. But at the same stroke
of twelve, thanks to the earnest nnd
almost unsnenkable tenacity of those
who would not lose, when these
spirits walk they will adopt into their
midst the shade of a new-departed
form that of one John Barlccorn,
who lived long nnd hard, and his
memory will be kept forever black
by the hopes he has crushed, the am?
bitions he has wrecked, the friend?
ship he has despoiled, and the
moans of deception, unscrupulous con?
duct and unmentionable denravity he
displayed while fighting for his worth?
less life.
Virginia is going dry!
"EMANCIPATION DAY."
"Virginia has another sacred day
in the calendar," says the Richmond
Virginian, "a day which will be re?
membered until time shall be no
more, by those on earth, while Heav?
ens uncounted, hosts will ever praise
its dawning; September 22. 1914,"
to which another date should be ad?

LEE TRINKLE AT
JEWELL RIDGE
Democratic Candidate For Con?
gress is Greeted by Large
Crowd on Sandy Ridge?Ev?
idences of Prosperity.
Hon. E. Lee Trinkle, Democratic
candidate for Congress, invaded the
Sandy Ridge country near Richlnnds
Saturday night, and delivered one ?r
his characteristic addresses in the
Jewell Opera House to a largo au?
dience.
Mr. Trinkle reached Richlnnds in
the afternoon and was the guest of
the Democrats in that town until
about 6:80, when a special train was
run to the town of Jewell, reaching
the coal operation in about an hour.
About twenty Democrats from this
town went to Richlnnds by automobile
und Joined the parly at Jewell. Mr.
George W. St. Clair, manager of the
Jewell Hidge Coal Corporation, had
arranged for the speaking ami hud
everything iti readiness when the par?
ty arrived. The opera house on the
lop of Sandy Ridge, where the speak?
ing was held, was well tilled with the
people living in the community, the
miners nud nflicials of the company.
Mr. Trinkle, although worn out from
a hard day's campaigning, made an
address equal to any he has yet de?
livered. Hie people of Sandy Ridgu
were treated to an address and an ap?
peal for their voles upon a plane
never before attempted III that vicin?
ity. Never before had the Sandy
Ridge, whose bowels are being gulled
of the highest ? rice coal over known,
heard oratory equal to thai offered on
this occasion. Mr. Trinkle appealed
to the higher sensibilities of his nu
dience for their support, and not to
the baser passions as has been the
case often there. He stated, as he has
done before, that he had challenged
Mr. Slemp time and again to meet
him in joint debate for a friendly
discussion of the issues, and Mr|
Slemp hail as often declined thu invi
tation. He pointed out to the au?
dience the many good things that
were theirs on account of Woodrow
Wilson's efforts in their behalf; he
brought to their attention in a most
forcible way the benefits accruing to
this country from the President's ef?
forts to keep peace; that their sons
and fathers were pursuing their daily
avocations and not lighting in the
trenches or sleeping in unmarked
graves on some foreign battle field;
that the country was more prosper?
ous now than at any period in the
memory of any of his hearers; that
the product from their labors wus
more remunerative now than at. any
other time; and that the only assur?
ance of tho continuance of these con?
ditions was the re-election of a Dem?
ocratic President ami a Democratic
Congress.
Mr. Trinkle was frequently inter
r lip ted by applause, ami was greeted
when he entered the opera house with
"Trinkle. Trinkle, Trinkle; he's all
right; who's nil right? Trinkle!"
It is asserted by those familiar
with the conditions that the section
around Kichlands, which has hereto?
fore been strongly Republican, will
soon experience u change.
Empire is Now Heaping Benefits of
Democratic Prosperity.
On the way to Jewell Ridge the
train passes through the operation of
the Empire Coal Land Corporation,
which concern was thrown into bank?
ruptcy in the Roosevelt panic. As
we wended our way up the hollow
Saturday night it was noticed thnt the
coke ovens were in full blast, and in?
quiry developed the fact that the op?
eration is enjoying prosperity never
bore expected. And yet a number of
our friends in that community will
kill the goose that lays tho "olden
egg.
A Model Mining Town.
The town of Jewell is situated on
the top of tho mountain, overlooking
the tipple of the company. The com
pany has recently erected, and has
now in course of construction some
forty-five houses for tho employees,
including n church, inn, opera house,
club house, school house, etc. The
opera house is provided with a mod?
ern motion picture machine and the
school house is equipped with up to
date conveniences and has two ex?
cellent young ladies in charge, who
nre said to be doing fino work.
NORTH TAZEWELL OR BURKE'S
GABDEN SWITCH.
A business man here remarked the
other dny that "should the Clear Fork
branch of tho N. & W. now being
surveyed, terminate at Burke's Gar?
den switch. North Tnzewell will be?
set back and materially injured."
His idea wus that stores and busi?
ness houses would build nnd open at
the terminus, nnd to that extent
draw trade &c, from North Tnzewcll.
His view may or mpv not be cor?
rect. At nny rate the North Tazewcll
people, and the Tnzewell peonle us
well, will no doubt have an eye for
business nnd do what they can, if
anything to hnve the road terminate
nt North Tazewcll, which would, be?
yond question be of benefit to both
towns?Tnzewell and North Tazewcll.

Governor Stuart and Senator
Martin Address Large Au?
dience of Democrats in the
Court House Yard.
If there is any doubt in the minds
of the Republicans thuit the Democrats
uro not alive to the issues of the cam?
paign .in.-.i now closing, those doubts
were dispelled last Saturday, when the
largest crowd that has been seen hero
for many years at a Democratic
speaking came to town to hear Gov?
ernor Stuart, Senator Martin and oth?
ers address the voters in behalf of the
candidacy of Mr. Trinkle for Congress
and the National ticket. It wan in?
tended to have the speaking in the
Court House, but the crowd grew to
such proportions that it was necessary
to ladt! the meeting in the Court. lio?su
yard, at the same place used lust
week by Mr. Slemp, Senator Harding
und Mr. Muiicy. Governor Stuart
ami Senator Martin reached TUzo
well on No. 0, Saturday morning, ac?
companied by Judge Rh?n, of the Cor?
poration Commission, who spoke with
Senator Martin in Graham the night
before. The speakers were the guosta
at. dinner of Mr. George C. Peory
Democratic elector at large from
Virginia.
The speaking began at 1:80 by the
introduction of Senator Martin by
Attorney Win. II. Werth, of Tnzowcll.
Mr. Werth, in a short, pointed speech,
cited figures of a straw vote, recent?
ly taken by the Literary Digest, a
uon-pnrtiflun magazine, which show?
ed that Mr. Wilson had made such
wonderful gains in the past three
