VOLUME VIII. * EKALAKA, (FALLON COUNTY) MONTANA, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1916. NUMBER 44
All America Is Shou tir? "Wikon 's The Man."
O'KERN SHOULD
BE ELECTED
Present Judge Is Qualifield To
Remain on The Bench,
Vote For Him.
Daniel L. O'Hern, judge of the
district court and candidate for
reelection, was born in Fort
Dodge, Iowa, 34 years ago. He
was edici'ed in the country
schools, Tobin college and the
Iowa State university, where he
completed his legal education.
After finishing school, Mr.
O'Hern came to Montana to prac
tice law, locating at Missoula.
His winning personality gave him
a law practice and a uersonal fol
lowing from the outset. In 1910
he was elected a representative
in the legislature on the demo
cratic ticket.
In the state legislature Mr.
O'Hern quickly devfloped into
one of the leaders of the house.
He championed the cause of T.
J. Walsh and was one of the
leaders in the unsuccessful fight
to elect the great Helena lawyer
to the United States senate.
While a member of the legis
lature Representative O'Hern
encountered the woman suffrage
question and did not dodge it as
so manj-politicians'did: He was
JUDGE O'HERN
chairman of the house committee
on development and publicity,
and during the session a resolu
tion submitting a woman suffrage
amendment to the voters of Mon
tana was referred to his commit
tee. The idea was that it would
be buried there, but Mr. O'Hern
promptly reported it favorably
and thus compelled a vote upon
the qnestion on its merits. Miss
Jeannette Rankin of Missoula
was given the privilege of the
floor of the house to speak in fa
vor of the resolution and when
the vote was counted it had passed

ingredients and expert compounding will insure just the
results anticipated by your physician.

The Reliable Drug Store
S. A. Holt, Registered Druggist g
me nouse. 11 uieu mere, now
ever, and was heard of no more
until the next session.
Shortly following his term in
the legislature, Mr. O'Hern came
to eastern Montana, locating at
Glendive, where he served as as
distant prosecuting attorney. His
service in this capacity had just
expired when Governor Stewart
appointed him judge of this dis
trict, in which position he has
served for the last eighteen
months. v
That Judge O'Hern has given
eminent satisfaction on the bench
:is shown by the esteem in which
J he is held by the members of the
bar and by the public. Regard
I less of politics the opinion is en
j tertained that he is entitled to
reelection and his friends con
fidently expect that this will be
! the verdict of l:he people when
the ballots are counted Novem
ber 7th.
Elevator Burns Down.
I
The Ekalaka Milling Co.'s e;e
vator property and other adjoin !
ins? buildings with the exception
of the residence was destroyed
by fire last Friday evening. The
alarm was turned in about 8:45
and by the time the firemen ar
rived with their apparatus the
flames had gained such headway
that it was impossible to save
anything excepting the residence
prooerty and the homes and
buildings surrounding. It was'
indeed lucky for all that the wind
was not blowing hard and that
the general direction of what;
there was carried the flames to
the west over the race track.
The cause of the blaze has not
been ascertained but it is pre
sumed that children while play
ing about the building and dos-|
sibly smoking started it. The'
elevator has not been in opera
tion this fall and was locked up.
The loss is estimated at ab>ut
$14,000 with $7,000 insurance.
Miss Olsen Here.
Miss Stella Olsen, republican
candidate for county superintend
ent of schools was here Monday
and Tuesday campaigning
amongst the voters. She reports
favorable consideration in all sec
tions on her candidacy and will
no doubt poll a very large vote
throughout the county. Many of
the democrats have practically
conceded the election of Miss
Olsen and of course the republi
cans predict her a sure winner.
