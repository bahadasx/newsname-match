I think the Tigers have the c-dga
on us, but with an even break to ttd
luck Texas will win." said Van' Gent,
this afternoon.
The team will average about 165"
pounds, the backfleld being light and
fast The line averages 172 while the
backfleld men will not tip the scales
at more than 155.
The practice at Boonville was light
this morning, the men being given a
chance to limber-upj after their long
trip from the land of cactus. The fea
ture of the morning practice was the
passing of Hedick. He used the short
fast pass and is an artist in the line.
The two ends, who are also baseball
men, pulled the passes out of the air
at some very difficult angles. The
team will go through a lfght work'oat
this afternoon, and will arrive in Co
lumbia tomorrow morning'on an early
train. The team is in excellent spirits
and seem to feel that victory ia'ajpfr-

Dr. H. H. Powers this afternoon iathe
last of his series of lectures In the

of the lecture was "America and the

Continuing his lecture of last night
Dr. Powers insisted that, we could not

could, defend our Yourselves from a

cording to thejlecturer. "We could not
however do it 'alone1.
"There, is a method of defending

Powers. "We should hajto trans

the greatest In the world doubling
that of Germany, Insist on universal
military service. In this way we could
defend ourselves."
