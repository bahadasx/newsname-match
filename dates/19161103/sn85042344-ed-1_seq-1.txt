Judge Clay Orders -tempo

WILL CARRY CASE TO
THE SUPREME COURT
FTa of Traffic Cars 'Are
Now Running in Viola
tion of Ordinance.
m ft.-, lltnov owners lost their In
JL Junction suit In- district court
jrV.vrduy. Judge T. P. Clay ordered
tfcc the temporary restraining order
against the city which wus grunted
by Judge Breckinridge of the superior
court last week he vacated and denied
the application for a permanent In
junction. The Injunction milt was
brought to prevent the city from en
forcing the new Jitney ordinance.
The jitney men announced that
they would appeal their case to tne
supreme court. Whether they will he
allowed to operate while the appeal
Is ponding is a iiuestlon which will he
threshed out this morning before
Judge Davis.
Last night only a part ot the
Jitneys were running. Some of the
owners declared that they would not
violate the ordinance until It is de
termined that they have that right.
Lawyers Disagree.
The attorney for the jitney owners
assorts that the temporary restraining
order holds good pending an appeal
but this Is refuted by City Attorney
Meserve and his assistant. John Wond
ard. Judge Davis Inst night Instructed
both parties to have their arguments
readv for this morning.
Some of the Jitneys were running
last night with the signs removed. No
"charge" was made but passengers
were allowed to make "donations" foi
the service.
The ordinnnec objected to by the
Jitney operators was passed three
weeks ago by the city commission
board. It limits the number ot pas
sengers carried by a jitney to two more
than the registered capacity of the
car and fixes a license fee of $75 a
year. The Jitney owners contend that
the passenger limit would be ruinous
to their busines.
More consideration was given the
amount of license than the passenger
limit by Judge Clay yesterday. He ex
pressed doubt that the city had the
right to charge a license that high
out laicr susiuincu vm- cuj ti iiumui-
lty on that point.
Cites Cases.
Numerous cases in other states were
cited by the city's attorneys to prove
that the number of passengers should
be limited In some states the Jitneys
are forbidden to carry any passengers
on the running board.
No arrests will bo made by traffic
officers until the right of the Ijtneys
to operate under tho appeal la de
termined. HONOR CONVICTS

given as Villa's objective when tho

As far as Is known here there are
only nlno Americans einployid at Par.

cording to Americans u ho formerly
lived there.
Parral Is 54 miles southwest of

In Parral and said the garrison was
well supplied with ammunition, arms
and artillery.
Fear for Safely.
American mining men who have
Interests In Parral ure much con
cerned over the fate of the nine Amur,

This concern was Increased tonight
by news from Chihuahua City that the
bandits who held up tho Mexican l1-n-tral
pasesngcr train Monday evening
at Lagumt station assaulted Dr.
Steven llaffner, a Herman .subject, be
cause they thought ho was an Ameri
can. At the general offices of the Alvar-
ado Mining & Milling Co. here It was
staled that no information bad been
received with reference to the report
that Villa troops had captured Parral
The Alvarado company Is one of the
largest operating In the Parral district
and its officials here are making ef
forts to obtain information from their

information from Chihuahua City re
garding the reported capture of Par

Theso mining men declare the re
port of villa's capture of the town
verifies the report that Villa and libs
command had been In possession of
Santa Rosalia as it was announced
that he would movo on Parral from
