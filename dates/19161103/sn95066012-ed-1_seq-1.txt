Luther and Eunice (Hyde) Torrey,
wss born in Stratton July 4, 1830, and
died in New York city Sunday, Oct. 8,
1916, having been confined to his bed
for seven years with paralysis. Mr.
Torrey married Margaret Gallagher of
Poughkeepsie, N. Y., in 1866. They
had 10 children.
He was descended from James Tor
rey, whose family came to this coun
try, in 1638 and settled in Scituate,
Mass. The burial took place in St.
Michael's Episcopal cemetery, New
York city. Rev. G. N. Deyo officiated
at the funeral services.
Mr. Torrey prepared for college at
Leland & Gray seminary, Townshend.
and Burr & liurton seminary, Man
chester where he afterwards taught
a class in Latin. He graduated from
Middlebury college in the class of 18
55 and 1856 and taught school in East
Dorset and Poughkeepsie, N. Y., in
Warilng's Military academy, of which
he was vice principal from 1S56 to 18

a storehouse for historical facts and
on international affairs. Ho was con
sidered an expert in games such as
chess and checkers and was said to be
ono of the strongest men (who ever
came down the mountain. His friends
will miss him as he was a good-natured,
whole-souled man, a hail fellow,
well met, the last of a long-lived fami
ly. He loved to tell of having heard Dan
iel Webster make his famous speech
on Stratton mountain. He was about
10 years old at that time and his fath

which Webster stayed all night.
The old Torrey place has a log cab

UNTIL ELECTION
Administration Wants to Know if
it Has 4-Year or 4 Months Job
COMMISSION QUITS TILL NOV. 10
American Members Convinced Time
Has Not Yet Arrived to Withdraw
Gen. Pershing's Troopers.
Atlantic City, Nov. 2. The Amer
ican-.Mexican Joint Commission ad
journed a little after noon today to re
convene on Friday, Nov. 10, at. 10
o'clock in the morning. Luis Cabrera
Chairman of the Mexican section of
the commission, before starting for
New York to hear President Wilson at
Madison Square Garde;ii, said:
"We have set a comma to our work,
not a period. We will come back and
continue it to its final issue before
writing the period."
Secretary Franklin K. Lano, Chair
man of the American section, said
that he felt satisfied with the progress
made toward a settlement, ' and was
confident that an agreement would be
reached after the commission recon
vened. The outcome of the Presidential
election will be awaited with interest
by the Mexican Commissioners. They
believe that the result will necessarily
have a marked effect on the nature of
the plan which they may agree upon.
One of the Commissioners said that
the nature of the plan to be proposed
to President Wiison must, of course,
depend on whether he was to have
four months or four years in which to
carry, it into effect.
The conclussion to which the com
mission has arrived so far and whicli
have been embodied in memoranda
exchanged by the two sections lire
still too vague, in the opinion of the
Commissioners, to warrant their be
ing subjected to the test of public dia
cussion.
It has been possible for the AmerU
cans to convince the Mexican Com
missioners that the withdrawal of the
expeditionary column without any oth
er guarantee of the safety of the bor
der than a promise of the Carranza
Government is not to be thought of.
Thei military condition of Mexico has
been widely discussed, and many
changes have been suggested, among
them that of abandoning the time-
honored custom of the Mexican sold
ier of taking his wife, family and
household goods into the lit id with
him. It also has been Intimated that
the mere holding of towns will not
suppress brigandage and that a little
more real activity might show some
desirable results.
GERMANS GET NEW GUNS
Stopping of Allied Push Credited to
Increase in Artillery.
Berlin. Oct. 31 (via London. Nov.
1). Tho suffering of the German de
fensive on the Somme, which is credi
ted here with stopping the allied push
on Hapatime and Peronne and limiting
the advance of the French and British
to insignificant gains, is duo to the
restoration of the equilibrium in t he
matter of artillery between tho two
armiej.
Now that this nas oeen achieved, it
may be stated that Germany in Au
gust was confronted with difficulties
in the supply of munitions and the re
placement of worn out or damaged
guns, which it is declared was largely
responsible for the successes then
scored by the Allies.
Tho formation of a Department of
Munitions, announced yesterday. Is an
outward sign of Germany's determina
tion imt again to bo caught napping,
but to Increase the production of mu
nitions to tho utmost possibilities.
The military critic of the Overseas
News Agency, discussing the recent
Entente offensive on the Somme front.
says:
'The Somme battle has been re
sumed with intensity during the last
few days, but the Anglo-French forces
obtained nothing but thesinullest
local advantages near Les Itoeufs.
Meanwhile the Germans could record
a great success In tho taking of La
Maisonette and connecting trenches at
Pinches. The victorious German in
fantry regiment No. 350 took prisoner
412 men and 15 officers.
'Alter sanguinary losses and suffer
ing during the last attacks near U'S
lloeufs the French on October 28 tried
a big thrust against Chaulnes, which Is
tho extreme southern point of the
Somme front. They intended to crush
this position, which Is shaped like a
wedge, in the same style as the at
tacks on the road near Flors, east of
Gucudecourt, east of Les lloeufs.
northeast of Morval and near Sailly.
This attack on the 28th, which had
been prepared by copious shelling, was
hehl down bv the German curtain of
fire."

MOURNED AS DEAD 11 YEARS
Pittsfield Young Man Mysteriously
Missing More Than a Decade
Pitt field, Nov. 3. Mourned as dead
for 11 years, Fred Jacob, son of Paul
A. Jacob of 173 King street, has
proved himself very much alive, for
his brother, Alfred Jacob, has received
a letter stating that Fred is now work
lug in the Oakland motor company's
plant in Michigan. While a student
at the Pittsfield high school, he disap
peared and his coat and hat were
found on tho ice of Morewood lake.
December 26, 1905. At the time he
was piominent in athletics at the high
school and it was thought that an in
jury to his head, received in a foot
ball game, had unbalanced li is mind.
A nation-wide search was made, but
every clew proved futile.
At one time he was traced to Ver
mont, and the letter states that when
the men who were searching for him
went in the front door of a house in
that state Fred went out the back
door, and again completely disap
peared. Cards bearing his picture and
description were sent broadcast but
to no avail. Ho Is now about 29 years
old and writes that for five years he
worked on farms in Vermont and it
was in the first of this span of years
that he saw men coming to look for
him and disappeared the second time.
Later ne attended college in Ver
mont for two years and after working
on the railroad for a year went to
Michigan where he is now employed.
He is well and happy and said in the
letter ha was sorry he had run away,
but would not give in until ur had
made good. Many times he started to
write, but remembered his determina

PLAYGROUND MOVEMENT GROWS
Association at Williamstown Issues
Attractive Pamphlet.
A very attractive booklet has been
received from the Williamstown Play
ground Association titled "The Play
ground Movement, What It means to
Williamstown." From the motto on
the first page, "Every person in Wil
liamstown a member of the Williams
town Playground Association," to the
last word, this little pamphlet
breathes the right community spirit.
Williamstown is particularly fortu
nate in having an Ideal playground
space ready for their activities, and
even more fortunate in having the
full sympathy and co-operation of the
school authorities in the movement.
The pamphlet calls attention to the
fact that in taking up the work of or
ganizing such a community enterprise
their town is simply falling in line
with a great movement whose gootl ef
fects are being felt from one end of
our country to the other.
What Williamstown hopes to accom
plish is sets forth as follows:
First: under the direction of a first
class supervisor, to establish a graded
system of exercises and game in the
schools adapted to the age and condi
tion e.f each group or child.
Second: as the need is proved and
means for meeting the conditions are
found, a community center in the
High school building is to bo organiz
ed for the young people who are not
members of the schools, for afttr
school or evening hours.
Third: provision Is to be made as
soon as possible for the proper equiu-
ment of tho playgrounds out of doors.
Fourth: tho system of play and rec
reation is to be extended to the rural
districts within our town liiViits.
Fifth: opportunity is to be provid
ed for adult groups of tho community
to engage in healthful and inspiring
recreation.
GLANDERS SUSPECTED
Horse Owned by Carl Bugbee Killed
by Veterinary Burgess.
A horse belonging to Carl I'.ugbce,
following an examination made Thurs
day, has been killed by Veterinary
H. W. Hurgess. The examination
showed clinical symptoms of gland
ers and the animal was accordingly
killed and the carcass was burned.
Tho suspected case was reported
to State Cattle Commissioner F. L.
Davis who ordered that all of Mr. Hug
bee's horses, four in number, be test
ed. Suspicious response was made in
only onei case, that of the animal
which has been killed.
The horse killed was purchased in
Troy about two years ago. It Is a
violation of the statutes at the present
time to bring horses into Vermont
from other states without examination
and the commissioner will prosecute
all violations.

HUGHES ROYALLY
WELCOMED BACK
TO ALBANY
Republican Candidate Rends
Gentleman s Peace Argument
DEFENDS RIGHT TO CRITICISE
If Elected President American Rights
Will Be Upheld on Land and
Sea.
Albany , Nov. 3. Fired by enthus
iasm resulting from being welcomed
back to Albany by 30,000 of its citi
zons, Charles E. Hughes, at Harmanus
Bleecker hall, last night, made a di
red answer to President Woodrow
Wilson's assertion that the United
StateB is enjoying a "gentleman's
peace," and the assertion of the Presi
dent that the Republicans want to put
this nation in the position of a baggart
and blustering giant.
"The peace of a gentleman," sail
Hughes, "is the peaco of a gentleman
unafraid, alert in his self-respect, and
getting his rights, quietly ami calmly
ready to maintain them."
The great audience of 3.500, who
jammed into Harmanus P.leecker hall
to hear the candidate, had already
cheered and y el bid Itself hoarse the
demonstration for Hughes lasted six
und one-half minutes by the watch
hut there was another uproar at
Hughes' declaration of his ideas of a
gentleman's peace.
"What is the use of talking about
serving humanity in foreign parts if,
when you go to foreign parts to serve
humanity, you are left there to die
and your flag means only nn invitation
to come back?" asked Hughes, and the
crowd once m6re shouted its appreci
ation.
Earlier in the evening, Hughes had
answerpd Wilson's insinuation that it
Is unpatriotic of the Republican can
didate to criticise tho foreign policy
of the administration at such a time
as this. Here Mr. Hughes said:
"Our opponents do not seem to like
the idea of criticism with respect to
international policy; but I beg to re
mind ihein that an American Presi
dent is elected for a term of four
years, and that under our institutions,
at the conclusion of that term, the peo
pie express their minds.
"When a matter is of such import
ance as the maintenance' of American
rights, it Is highly necessary that
American opinion should be ex
pressed: anil I have no apology to
mako In standing before you and in
saying thut if I am elected president.
I propose that the American flag shall
not be only a symbol of courtesy, a
symbol of justice, but it shall be the
.symbol of firmness and consistency,
in maintaining our known rights on
land and sea throughout the world."
There was tremendous applause at
this statement, which was made dur
ing the Hughes speech in Schenectady
Hughes went on :
"That is not a policy of war. !n my
judgment it Is the? condition upon
which alone wo can bo assured of
lasting peace."
Once more he. was interrupted by a
burst of applause, and then he had
this to say of tho Democratic cry that
"Wilson has kept, us out of war:"
"There never has been n time, per
haps, In our history. when it was
easier to keep the American nation
out of war than during the past few
years, when every nation engaged in
tho great strife abroad desired our
friendship, and would not by reason of
any assertion of our just rights, forfeit
that friendship."

tire community and the intelligent in
terest and support of the entire com
munlty is needed to make it -success
ful. The association therefore at its

every citizen of Bennington. They
will not bo sent by mail but be distri
buted by special messengers. The
earnest attention of everyone inter
ested in the common gootl is request
ed.
The work of the association is sup
ported by village appropriation, by the
natural income lrom tho work and by
membership fees; for instance, tho
Hallowe'en celebration participated in
by COO and witnessed by
approximately 8000 people. It
is a splendid manifestation of
public spirit. tho good re
sults of which none questioned. In
most towns it would have been ne
cessary to take up a large special sub
scription to meet the expenses but
here not a penny w as solicited, one vo
luntary gift ami the Welfare treasure-
ry provided for everything. Not only
this but the summer playground, the
winter gymnasium classes, the social
dancing, the dramatic clubs, the camp
fit o groups, all community celebrations

ELECTRICITY ON ST. PAUL
Road Will Have 440 Miles So Equipped
January 1
New York. Nov. 2. Officials of the
Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Rail
way announced yesterday that by the
first of the new year the road will
have 440 miles of electric line in oper
ation across the Rock Mountains, at
some points at a height of 6,330 feet.
Tho road recently added llo miles
to its electricity operated lines In
Montana. The last, stretch of tra.'k
turned over to the huge electric en
gines extends from Deed Lodge to Al
btrton, Mon.. and is the third unit to
be changed from steam to electricity,
bringing the electrified mileage up to
3.'!i'. The 220 miles between Harlow
ton and Deer Lodge were put under
electric operation several months ago.
St. Paul otlicials say the big moun
tain ranges of the west now have lost
their terror to the railroad man. the
electric locomotive having solved the
problem of steep grades and winter
weather. Fewer delays, smoother rid
ing and greater cleanliness for the
travelers arc said to be some advant
ages of the new system.
"Electrification has been a tremend
ous success," said C. A. Goodnow, as
sistant to the president. "The St. Paul
has forgotten that the Continental Di
vide cvi.sts. On a 2 per cent grade
over the Rockies the elertilc engines
haul ten or eleven steel passenger cars
at speeds varying from twenty to
twenty-live miles an hour. On the
same grades with one helping engine
2.ri0t ton freight, trains are hauled. It
is expected that the tonnage will bo
increased to 3,000 when the whole
stretch of track is electrified."
