REV. P. J.
MURPHY
AT THE PRINCESS
The Rev. Patrick J. Murphy, a
Catholic Priest of Dalhart, Texas, and
one of tjhe leading anti-saloon cam-
paigners in tne Lone Star State, de
livered a prohibition address last
evening in the Princess Theatre be
fore one of the largest audiences as-
semMed in Clifton for some time. For
fuhy two hours he held the attention
of his-hearers, in his arraignment of
the liquor traffic and the saloon.
It was evident from the frequent ap
probation he received, that his posi
tion on the dry side of the issue was
indorsed by the people of Clifton.
Father Murphy has spent 20 years
of his priesthood In tne cause of tem
perance, and is an enthusiast on the
subject. He was a Paulist missionary
in the slums of New York and Chi
cago and came in contact with the
evils generated by the use and abuse
of intoxicating drink.
He was assaulted and nearly beaten
to death by a barkeeper on his first
arrival in Texas, and his description
of The occurrence was pathetic. Since
then he has seen nine tenths of the
state dry, and predicts that this elec
tion will close up the last whiskey
joist in Texas. ' The Rev. Father
is campaigning the State of Arizona
at his 'Own expense. He wBl speak
in Tucson tonight.

CLIFTON
T-.L. Lichfield, a business and
mining man of Globe, Arizona, and
president of the North Dominion Cop
per Mining and Development Corpora
tftin, was a visitor at Morenci the lat
ter part of the past week. The object
of Mr, Lichfield's visit was to confer
with Mr. W. Richards, connected
with the Detroit Copper Company for
the past 18 years as an expert mining
man and A. Billard, director of the
North Dominion Copper Mining and
Development Corporation, of Globe,
Arizona. We understand ' that large
immediate development of the com
pany's property id to take place. , A
few days ago they purchased for caBh
consideration a group known as the
Bankers claims adjoining their prop
erty, shippers and producers et high
grade copper ores. Pt is the purpose
of the company tot tunnel thru the
lower part of said claims to facilitate
larger shipment of ore, besides the
opening np of other claims in which
large bodies of ore are in sight lb the
past two weeks a number of people
from Morenci and elsewhere have in
spected the company's property and
thy have wired and written their
friends- that the North Dominion is
P. K. Mr. A. Bfllard who organiz-
sd the company has operated as a
successful organizer in various parts
of the states but in the past few years
has resided in Mexico, where he has
larg- interests, the success that the
company has in placing its stock thru
the managership of Mr'. A., Billard,
shows that he has surrounded himself
by efficient business and mining men
nrrt that their proposition is as they
say tubject to the investigation of the
most skeptical. Announcement will
ie made some day next week that
their stock is selling at one dollar a
shire instead of fifty cents.

To the Voters of Arizona: ""'""'-i
The Democratic State Committed
wishes to call the attention of the
voters of the state to two facts hey
j should bear in mind when entering
the voting booth on the seventh of
November.
First: The name of Herny D.
Ross, democratic nominee for mem
ber of the Supreme Court does not ap
pear on the ballot under the party
name, but is placed in a non-partisan
list at the top of the ticket. Thia
applies to the candidate for Superior
Judge in each county.
Second: The law provides that the
names of candidates for State Tax
Commissioner shall also be placed on
the ballot without party designation,
therefore the name of Charles R.
Howe, democratic candidate for that
office, appears on the top of the bal
lot as does the name of Judge Ross.
We realize that there are thous
ands of voters in the state who will
vote a straight democratic ticket,
who will be greatly disappointed if
they learn later that they overlook
ed -Judge Ross and Mr. Howe, for
this reason we take this method of
jties in this section of the state
That
the public has confidence in the future
of P. D. Extension .has been demon-
. strated by the quick sales of stock
; already put on the market, and it is
j the concensus of opinion that it is the
best buy in the state today
