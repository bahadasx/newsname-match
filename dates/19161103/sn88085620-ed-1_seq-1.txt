CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT IS
A VICIOUS IDEA
Reversal of Form to Mediaeval Times
and Feudalistic Institutions —Peo-
ple Must Act to Save Their
Liberties Today
By JAMES E. BRADFORD
Progressive Candidate for Governor
I shall discuss in this article the
amendment to section 1, of article 6
of the state constitution. It rovides,
in substance, that no person can vote
on any question "to incur or not to
incur any debt or obligation, or to bor
row money or issue any bond or obli
gation, or to ratify or validate any
debt, bond or obligation, or to author
ize the purchase, sale, mortgage or
pledge of property, revenue or in
come," unless at the date of his regis
tration such voter owns property
"upon the tax rolls" and pays taxes
thereon. The amendment is based on
the false notion and vicious fallacy
that persons without property pay no
taxes; that only those who own prop
erty pay taxes. Who really pays taxes
anyway? A little reflection will show
such fallacy. You go to Jones' store
or into the market anywhere and buy
bread, boots or any of the necessaries
or luxuries of life and pay the retail
cost price. You pay no taxes because
you own no property? Don't you know
that each purchase you make you help
pay Jones' taxes? That among other
things that determine the retail price
of everything you buy are the wages
to his help, insurance, repairs and
taxes? In his busir.ess and bookkeep
ing he adds the taxes as part of the
operating exponses of his business,
and his patrons pay these taxes and
other expenses in carrying on Jones'
business. When you pay 5 cents to a
car company to ride, you help pay all
its taxes; as a matter of fact, such
patrons, whether they own property
or not, pay the taxes of the store
keeper and car company. You rent a
building and the amount of the rent
is determined by the sum of insur
ance, taxes and so forth that the owner
pays. He pays the taxes nominally,
but you indirectly and actually pay
them.
Cannot Help Yourself
You are married and have a wife
and six children, and are interested
in their health, but under this amend
ment, if you have committed the crime
of being poor, you cannot even vote
to incur any debt or to purchase any
property, to put in pure water or
sewerage system to protect the health
of your own family against the awful
scourge of disease, which conies from
bad water and sewerage systems. You
must sit idly by, clinging to the old
has of poverty and pay the taxes
Of the rich landlord, or the car com
pany, while they ride about in their
seven passenger auto, and on election
day they vote against wholesome im
provements "to keep taxes down"!
How do you like the picture? It is
not overdrawn.
A Relic of Feudalism
This amendment smells mediaeval,
when the feudal system and aristoc
racy flourished. In the dim past prop
erty restrictions upon the right to
vote were common. The aristocracy
of wealth and property owned by the
few favored it, just as the big owners
of wealth and the capitalistic rings
now favor it. This amendment is a
crippled chick, hatched from the egg
or corporate greed and wealth. Its
adoption would turn the hands of
progress back 200 years. The labor
ing classes must continue to produce
the wealth of the world owned or con
trolled by those who favor this amend
ment; they must always respond to
the bugle blast and fight the battles
of the world, and upon the return of
those who survive pay the heavy
laves and cost of wars. But despite
the performance of all these and other
duties, they must be denied the right
to-vote on those things which mean
u„. most to them—on all such ques
tions their overlords and the aristoc
racy of property will represent them!
If you desire to retain the full right
to vote you must rally all your forces
and butter this amendment down to
defeat. Support those for public of
fice who are battling for you and
your rights. The last republican leg
islature adopted and submitted this
amendment, and Governor Ulster did
not protest. The state republican
platform endorses it, and republican
candidates are running on that plat
' form.
Vote against it.

Spirit Rousers
By CHARLES PERRY TAYLOR
Secy. Washington State Federation
of Labor.
What on earth would we do
For amusement
If tt were not for politics?
Circuses come only twice a year;
Moving picture shows are stale,
And vaudeville is hackneyed—
But the mudslingers of politics
Never fail to divert.
Hughes roasts Wilson, Wilson raps
Hughes;
Both seem to like it.
Mcßride calls Lister a waster,
Lister calls Mcßride a boozer.
And there you are.
Each rises in his exalted dignity
And disclaims intention
Of throwing any mud on his opponent;
And then, lo and behold,
Proceeds to plaster mire and slime
All over the landscape.
Why? Because the voters like it.
Because they enjoy hearing men
Blackguard each other;
Because the American people
Love a fight, fair or foul,
But love a word fight
All the more when it is foul.
Three hundred and sixty-six days
In every year, Sundays not excepted,
We gloriously patriotic Americans
Chase the almighty dollar
Until the eagle
Fairly squawks and gasps for breath.
Then on election day
We go down to the polls and vote.
Intelligently?
Not by a damned sight.
We listen to misrepresentation,
Slander, innuendo, inference,
Mudslinging, lies,
And we think we know how to vote.
Bah, bah, pooh, pooh.
We all want the political fleshpots.
All we care for is to be a winner,
Or among those who do win,
So we can brag that we won.
But as for knowing the real,
The relative merits,
Of the opposing candidates,
Not one voter in one hundred knows;
He only thinks he knows.
Brass bands, printed lies,
Political mudslingings—such is
politics.
But there is something at stake
This time more important
Than rivalries of parties or men.
That something is the liberty
Of assemblage, of press, of speech,
All citizens now enjoy.
It is a heritage that is priceless,
One which, easily lost, will not
Easily be regained.
Referendum Measure No. 6,
The so-called anti-picketing bill,
Is hellishly vindictive and unjust.
There are others just as bad.
There is a proposed constitutional
amendment
That is a lip on its face.
Beat them all;
Every one is vicious.
If your house was on fire
You would not wait for legislative
action;
If your child had the smallpox
You would not call in a faith cure
Unless you were a fool.
When your stale government
Is In danger of being Hartleyized,
The thing to do is to agitate,
Educate, organize, convince,
Every blessed minute you are awake,
Until the last vote is in the box.
We are winning now, every minute.
All we need is persistence
Until the fight is over.
The controlled executive is trying
To get into the band wagon.
Pity the poor deathbed repentance.
But while converts come, sincere or
not,
Their votes will be welcome.
It begins to look very much
As though we are going to beat
Every one of the Referendum
Villainies.
Now, all together, keep it up,
Until the last money-muzzled legislator
Is driven into his hole forever.
This is a government of, by, and for
The people, and this time.
My lords in Olympia,
The people are going to rule.

The Labor Journal
NO OPEN SHOP FOR
THIS REALTY COMPANY
Mr. Robert H. Mills received the
following letter last Monday and
handed it to the Labor Journal for
publication:
"Dear Sir: I am taking the liberty
of writing to you at the request of
friends of mine in regards to recent
trouble between labor and the Com
mercial Club of Everett. Will say that
I am heartily in sympathy with the
unions of Everett in their struggle to
obtain better wages and better condi
tions in general. Will say that I have
always refused to sign any papers and
have used my influence to keep others
from signing any that are in any way
against unions.
"That I am not a member of the
Against Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9
Referendum Measures and the
Constitutional Amendment
Everett Commercial Club; that I do
not believe that our best interests are
in the interest of the open shop, as I
believe that if we had no unions in
Everett we would have the cheapest
kind of Oriental labor in our mills,
and that is the reason that we stand
with the labor unions of Everett. We
also pledge labor that we will do all
in our power to better conditions in
every way we can, and in case we have
employment to employ only union
labor.
"We are in the real estate business,
also have a good line of insurance and
rentals, and do a general brokerage
business, and you can assure labor
that we will give all a fair deal.
Thanking you for this opportunity to
show how we stand, we are, yours
truly,
"WESTERN REALTY C 0.,"
"2827 Rockefeller Aye., Everett.
"By Jesse Whillans, Mgr."
The suggestion of cheap Oriental
labor in the letter is not unlikely the
dream of the fellows who run the
Commercial Club. Such an industrial
condition in Everett would be lust
about as helpful to our merchants as
to our labor unions.
Re careful about your vote. DON'T
vote for the seven referendum meas
ures —vote against them.
ANTI-WHISKY CAMPAIGN
The great volume of campaign liter
ature sent out by the republican com
mittees would seem to make the high
cost of white paper look like "30
cents," and yet that part of it relating
lo the main issues in the campaign so
far as the well being of the people is
concerned, namely, the seven referen
dum measures and the constitutional
amendment, you could stuff into your
eye. They all seem to think the liquor
question is the only one of interest to
the people in this campaign. They
seem to think that the declaration of
the republican convention is enough
and will be swallowed without a
"chaser" by the voters. The liquor
question is not an issue in this cam
paign, except as it relates to Initiative
Measure No. 18, known as the hotel
bill, bit it is used as a subterfuge to
blind the voters to the measures of
real moment to the people. Should
the seven referendum measures and
the constitutional amendment pass,
more harm would be done to the State
of Washington than if the state were
subjected to a deluge of whisky. This
liquor question in future ought to be
consideed by the referendum separate
and apart from all other elections on
its merits and not used as a screen
behind which a sneaking attempt is
1 mad* to abridge the liberties of the
people.

UNITY OF LABOR
Wilson Sentiment Predominates
Among Men of Labor
By GRANT HA MILTON
•No other presidential campagln In
the history of this country is compar
able with the one jusl closing. The
wealth owners and rad-grind em
ployers for the first time In political j
history stand in their true colors In
an effort to elect Candidate Hughes
upon a platform constructed by the
House of Have. The spectacle of
Candidate Hughes demanding that all
legislation passed by congress during
the last four years be wiped off the
statute books indicates the considera
tion that labor would receive at his
hands were he elected. No two con
gresses in the entire history of this
government passed so much needed
remedial labor legislation as did the
last two. To declare unreservedly
that this legislation should lie re
pealed is a direct and open bid for the
support of those who own the wealth
of the country and against those who
produce it.
During the period in which 1 have
been engaged in correspondence with I
local unions and the distribution of I
the records of the candidates, evidence
of the feeling of labor men and unions
against Candidate Hitches has been
most striking. There are two factors
which stand out pre-eminent above all
others. These elements comprise the
attitude of labor against war, and the
record of Candidate Hughes in the
Hanhury Hatters decision by the
United States Supreme Court. It is
my judgment that the labor logisla
tion enacted by congress constitutes
F the groundwork of the friendliness of
. the trade unions for President Wilson,
but undoubtedly the efforts of Un-
American Federation of l.abor in co-.
1 operation with the Mexican trade
unions and the avoidance of armed
conflict with Mexico through those ef
l forts, aided by the president, form the
strongest link in the chain of eircum
EVERETT TRADES COUNCIL.
OF ORGANIZED LABOR.
Stances which have brought the or
ganizations of labor to a degree of
Unanimity never before reached on
any political issue.
Trade unionists are not the cham
pions of war, for it is they who are
compelled to do the fighting, and also
to bear the great burden which fol
lows in its wake. Militarism has no
supporters among the men and women
of labor. Militarism interests all
members of the family, and the wage
earner's wife and family are as strong
in their convictions against war, if not
stronger, than the wage earner him
self. It is therefore not difficult to
discern the basis of the sentiment
now prevailing among the workers.
This first cause is bulwarked by
the decision rendered in the Danhury
Hatters case by the United States Su-
preme Court, with Mr. Hughes a mem
ber of that court and concurring in
the decision which took from the
hatters their homes and savings. The
experience that labor has had with
the courts and with judges is one long
story of abuse of the judicial power.
Judges do not commend themselves to
working people because of this gen
eral abuse. The laboring people take
the position that Candidate Hughes,
who concurred in decisions against
labor while a member of the Supreme
Court, is not very likely to promote
the rights and interests of labor if he
becomes president. No working man
can vote for Candidate Hughes with
out endorsing his decision in the Dan
bury Hatters case, as the result of
which workmen were robbed of their
savings and the shacks which shel
tered them. Advocates of war control
property and wealth, and the Danbtiry
Hatters decision emphasizes the con
trol of the courts by wealth —with
humanity forgotten.
The men and women of labor will
demonstrate on November 7 in a most
emphatic manner their disapproval of
the theory that dollars should he con
sidered paramount to humanity.

Referred Measures Represent
Vicious Legislative Program
Each and All of the Referendum Bills
on the Ballot and the Constitutional
Amndment Dovetail Into One Cen
tral Purpose, and That Purpose the
Curbing of the Rights of the People.
By EtARLEY L. HUGHES
Legislative Agent for the Washington
State Federation of Labor.
When you take your ballot into the
voting booth next Tuesday, carry with
you this thought: The entire seven of
the Referendum Measures, and the]
constitutional amendment limiting the
right to vote on all matters involving
finance to property owners, were
enacted by a legislature in control of
Special Privilege, and with an eye
single to the desire of Special Priv
ilege to take away from the common
people of the state some of the very
valuable rights and liberties they now
possess, and to make impossible future
progress.
If you vote against some of the
bills and for others, it will show that
you have not yet sensed fully the cun
ning program of legislative restriction,
if not absolute fettering of the people
as to their political and industrial
rights and liberties, that these gentle-'
men who have become powerful in the |
monopolistic control of the resources,]
industries and commerce of the state
may calmly proceed with the business
of picking our pockets, unannoyed by
any noisy protests—
Through a labor organization (killed
off by the anti-picketing bill. Referen
dum Measure No. 6); or —
By the use of the Initiative Refer
endum and Recall (killed off by Refer
endum Measures Nos. 3 and 4, par-
alyzing the use of these direct legis
lation provisions of the constitution);
or—
Through the medium of the people's
Direct Primary law (killed off by Ref
erendum Measure No. 5, the Party
political boss controlled Convention
bill); or —
Any opportunity to escape the mon
opoly power of public service utilities
in the hands of private capitalists (by
means of the Certificate of Necessity
bill, Referendum Measure No. 7,
which would give these utilities
legalized monopoly rights, even to the
exclusion of the rights of towns and
cities to install publicly owned
utilities): or—
Through municipal activities, by the
interference by the legislature with
the right of home rule in the manage
ment of such enterprises established
by municipalities, as in the case of the
Port of Seattle, an undertaking that
was fast breaking 'he hold of tin
waterfront monopoly of that city upon
the throat of the commerce of the
