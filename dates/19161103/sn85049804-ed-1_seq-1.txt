A CALL TO DUTY,
A STRONG APPEAL FROM bUR
OLD WARRIOR, OR. PHILLIPS
OF KEOKUK.
To the Editor of the Bystander:
We have tried to be fair in this po
litical campaign. We did not want to
worry ourselves about state or nation
al ticket, for we really thought that
every loyal Negro of the U. S. really
-had enough of Wilson, the weather
cock president, the father and promot
er of segregation, the man who has
\done only the one thing that the
American people can point to, and
tha tis to segregate the Negro in all
departments of the government. He
and his party with their rebel yell,
"Segregate the Negro."
Now don't understand me to say
that all democrats were rebels, but I
do say that all rebels were democrats,
and southern confederacy is in full
control of the government. Every
important committee of the house
and senate is headed by a southerner,
and their motto is, "No Negro need
apply." He must be jim crowed at all
cost, and think of it, the president of
a country like this to allow himself to
stoop so low to smother a helpless
people who are loyal to their country,
and are always ready to answer the
nation's call. We'll just stop here anf
say that he is too little to do a big
thing. Let "us take up state politics.
Now, Mr. Editor, I see by some of the
papers that Mr. Harding has got to be
a scapegoat for introducing some bill.
Strange that the poor unfortunate
•Negro had no one to champion his
cause before this. Harding was not
my man for governor. I worked at
the primary to defeat him, but the
voice of the republican party said
Harding. I am a republican and don't
ibelieve in stabbing in the back or hit
ting below the belt, and I pity the men
or men that go into a convention, and
because they are defeated sling mud
at the successful candidate. Every
loyal republican ought to support
Harding, most especially the Negro,
for the party behind Harding is more
to be trusted than all the other par
ties combined, so far as the Negro is
concerned. Where did the prohibition
party get its prestige in the state of
Iowa ^rorrr thtf republicah'parfcy.
There is nothing wro~~ in prohibition
when it's really fougj^ upon the line
of justice to all men, ^ut, my brother,
have they ever taken up a case in de
fense of the Negro unless there was
an ax to grind. Who is the father of
segregation, and discrimination, jim
crowing and the grandfather's clause I
The democratic party, of course, and
yet they expect us to play the dog,
to lick the hand that beat us. No, a
thousand times no. Hughes, Harding
and every republican candidate for
congress ought to receive the Negro's
support. I have been informed by a
reliable attorney of this state that this
Harding bill was all buncomb, but the
honorable attorneys, Brown, Thomp
son and Woodson, the watch dogs of
the Negroes of Iowa, happened to be
on the ground and defeated it and that
bill has never been heard of since, un
til Harding came out for governor,
for political prestige only. Put your
ear to the ground and listen, and don't
be mistaken. Hughes and Harding
will be elected and two more startling
events will follow—women will vote
and whisky will go.

THRONGS GREET NEG
RO TROOPERS BACK
IN CHICAGO*
Marching through a lane of welcom
ing relatives, friends and spectator^,
the Eighth (Negro) regiment returned
from Mexico yesterday, and after a
parade through the loop tUrned south
to the armory.
The troop train arrived shortly be
fore 9 o'clock in the Illinois Central
station, and there was greeted by the
welcoming shouts of thousands. A
committee of welcome, headed by
Mayor Thompson, a group of alder
men, civic societies, and the Hull
House band, jnet the soldiers and led
the parade through the downtown
streets.
As the soldiers bent their steps
southward they trooped through solid
walls of humanity whoiie howls of ap
proval sent discipline to the winds.
The regimental band played "San An
tone to Austin," which was composed
by Sergt. James B. Tucker, assistant
'bandmaster.
Every window in the line of march
was filled and there was a continuous
tumult as the men sought the armory
where a new outburst was received.
The men spent the remainder of the
day in being relieved of their military
duties and in accustoming themselves
to the ways of citizens again.
Only Ane thing marred the calm of
the homecoming. This was the killing
of Alfred Johnson during the excite
ment of mustering out when several
soldiers discharged their rifles in ec
stacy of fhe movement. Several sol
diers werd held in Springfield pending
a hearing and investigation.—Chicago

being the first Negro to be voted for
for judge of the district court of Polk
county at the general election to be
held on Tuesday, November 7th.
Attorney Brown is undoubtedly as
well qualified for district judge as any
one of those who are candidates^ and
as there are no party candidates, there
is no reason why every Negro in the
county should not cast his vote for the
candidate of his own race, especially
since he is as well qualified as any
other.
As the vacancy in this office was
created too late for any candidate to
have his name printed on the voting
machine it will be necessary for those
who desire to vote for district judge to
push up the slide No. 33 at the right
hand side and at the very top of the
machine and write in the blank space
there the name of the candidate he
desires to vpte for.
We hope that every Negro and
every other voter who desires to en
courage the advancement of deserving
Negroes will write in the name of S.
Joe Brown.

RICHESS NEGRO BOY
IN THE WORLD
LUTHER MANUEL'S INCOME IS
$20,000 TO $25,000 MONTH FROM
OKLAHOMA OIL.
Tulsa, Okla.*—Adam Manuel, a
Creek freedman, died in Colorado ra
cently, and already there is a race on
among some of the residents of Mus
kogee county to get the appointment
of guardian for his children.
There are five of the children living,
and thia elder Manuel inherited the al
lotments of two who are dead, but the
guardianship is sought because of
Luther Manuel, a minor son, who is
belioved to be the richest Negro boy
in the world.
When the allotments were made for
the Manuel family, those of Luther,
13, and Rafield, his younger brother,
were in a locality where the land was
worthless for farming purposes. Their
father complained that the land was
Valueless, but he was unable to have
any change made.
It turned out that the allotment of
Luther, believed to be worthless, was
in the heart of the Cushing oil field.
Since that field was developed nearly
six years ago his income from it has
amounted to from $20,000 to $25,000 a
month. The allotment of Rafield Man
uel is not so valuable. The allotments
of the other children are good for agri
cultural purposes only.
Sarah Rector has been considered
the most fortunate of all those among
the Creek freedmen who took allot
ments in that section of country, but
her fortune is far less than that of
Luther Manuel. For a time, when the
Cushing oil field^was at its best, or
for more than two years, his income
was $1,000 a day.—Chicago Daily
Tribune.
DR. W. SAMPSON BROOKS.
Dr. W. Sampson Brooks, who has so
acceptably filled the pulpit of St. Paul
A. M. E. church for the past five
years, left the city Friday for his new
field of labor in Wichita, Kansas. In
the departure of Dr. Brooks not only
St. Paul, but St. Louis loses a great
man from many viewpoints. St. Paul
has alwayq had well equipped pastors,
but-it will take an exceptional man to
follow Dr. W. Sampson Brooks, who to
by his Christian life, hearty handshake
and pleasing smile and his congenial
wife has won not only friends among
the church and ministry, but among
all classes of citizens.
As a financier, Dr. Brooks has few
equals in any denomination as a pul
pit orator his extensive travels and
broad experience makes him the mas
ter of his profession, his sermons at
all times profitable and instructive.
The trustees and officers of the church
know of his saving and worth to St.
Paul. A debt of over $14,000 met him
when he arrived five years ago, but
with his well formed plans and
confidence of his congregation, wiplgi
18 months and burned the mortgage
out the long standing debt in less than
the presence of an overwhelming
audience, a most marvelous achieve
ment which could only have been ac
complished by a W. Sampson Brooks.
Dr. Brooks has accepted the pastor
ate of the largest A. M. E. church in
Wichita, which is brand new and per
haps overwhelmingly in debt and
/needs his great service to relieve it
of some of its burdens. We wish for
him and his faithful companion a
hearty reception and that he may live
long to do much good for the Master
and his people in the many avenues of
life.—The Fraternal Clarion.
Rev. Brooks is well known here, as
he paStored at the St. Paul A. M. E.
church here several years. We are
glad to note his raise and we congrat
ulate him.
