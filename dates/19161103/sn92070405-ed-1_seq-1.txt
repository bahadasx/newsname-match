SWEEPING REPUBLICAN VICTORY
ASSURED IN NATION AND STATE
THE Republican party will sweep the nation on Novem
ber 7th in one of th most stupendous political vic
tories in the history of the nation.
This is the confident forast of those in close and inti
mate personal touch with the national situation and who
know the sentiment oí the country an a whole and the pres
ent trend of popular feeling in favor of diarios E. Hughes
and against Wilson and the Wilson policies.
Victory for the Republican party is conceded by prac
tically every man who has had an opportunity for n careful
survey of the whole situation. It is an election in which
one of thoso drifts of sentiment, which at .long intervals oc
cur in this nation, is to carry Charles É. Hughes to the
White House probably with an unprecedented majority be
hind him.
In New York city; the heart and center of politieal
sentiment, betting now is two to one in favor of Hughes and
Wilson money is hard to find even at such odds. In New'
Mexico as elsewhere Democratic newspapers are printing
forecasts, alleged straw votes, estimates and predictions in
a desperate effort to stem the tide of public sentiment. The
Democrats are making the greatest publicity effort on rec
ord to check the growth of the Hughes land' slide. But the
effort is a hopeless one. American sentiment has been de
termined. The national feeling has become fixed and Re
publican victory is no longer in doubt.
Here in New Mexico the same condition prevails. A
majority for Charles E. Hughes is assured. Holm 0. Bur.
num will be elected governor by an overwhelming majority.
With him the whole Republican state and congressional
ticket will go into office. In New Mexico as in the nation
public sentiment has become fixed. The result is no longer
in doubt. Republican victory is assured. It is time now for
every New Mexico Republican to get behind his united pnrty
arid add to the magnitude of the victory.

RAMSEY SPEAKS
TO BIG CROWD
The largest crowd yet attending a
political gathering mi Iordsburg
since the opening of the V)IC cam
paign, beard Judg W. R. Ramsey,
foimcr assistant attorney general of
tho state of Colorado, speak on the
Issues of the Republican party at the
K. of P. Hall on Friday night. Prac
tically nil tho local Republicans at
tended and many of the trong Demo
crats came out to hear the dis
tuiguishcd orator
Mr. Ramsey handled in a clear,
concise -vay the rrorc important is
sues of the Republican campaign in
1916' and drove home his points in n
way tht few will forget. He began
with the pride Americans nave al
ways had in their Repiblif and in t!.e
flag, stating that our pride should be
maintained nt all t'mcs, whether we
bo in America, Mexico or on the east
ern continent. He attacked the
UndcrWood tariff bill and its dis
astrous effects upon tho United States
just prior to the European War. Ho
cited the mobilization of Coxey's
army which had been dormant since
tho Cleveland administration and
which again put in its nppparance
together with national-wido soup
louscs. Then came the war bringing
with it orders for munitions and sun
olics saving America from a repeti
tion of "tariff for revenue only" re
sults. Mr. Ramsey quoted well
known Democrats on the failure of
the administration and especially the
governor of Texas who declared the
policies to bo absolute failures at all
times. He cited members of Wilson's
cabinet who had made statements
reflecting upon the honor of our fnre
pathers especially the speech of Sec
retary Baker when ho compared
Washington's soldiers nt Valley
Forge to a class of peons in Mexico.
President Wilson's instability on
the question of vital importance to
the United States received rareful
'onimcnt at the hands of Mr.
Ramsey. Ho compared the president
to the old time circus ncrobiit who
-limbed onto the trapecio and pro
ceded to disrobe dropping from time
to time various colored garments un
fil he remained in pink tights and
rreen-spangled trunks: AND THEN
TN CAME THE ELEPHANTS.
The wishy-washy note sending to
Germany and England and the post
cript that Germany should not take
the notes too seriously was talked of
y the speaker at length.
"1 hear wherever I go the same old
song 'Wilson has kept us out of war.'
What war? Surely not the war with
Mexico. Our soldiers have been killed
in battle. There has been blood-shod
and murder. It this is not war. what
is war?" declared Mr. RnmEcy in dis
cussing the Wilsonian policy in Mex
ico.' Ho cited the occurences at Vcre
Cruz and at Curazal ind gave hii
hearers a good lot to thu;l about. He
praised the record of Charles Evans
Hughes nnd h's policy of "America
First and America Efficient " From
beginning to end Mr. Ramsey held
the attention of his audience nnd pul
in an hou.- nnd three-quarters of cf
fectivo work m establishing in the
minds of his audience the advisability
of returning to powqr the party that
has never suiTeicd trjo humiliation of
its citizens no mattu where they may
have been In any parft of the world

BARNES' SHOWS HERE
TOMORROW THE 4TH
A splink, splanking new show, a
new program not so new, however,
but what the time-honored features
which have made the circus America's
most popular form of amusement,
arc retained, arc the promises held
forth for the circus that is to visit
Lordsburg on Saturday, Nov. 4th and
give two performances.
The circus referred to, of course, is
the world's greatest wild animal
show the Al G. Barnes' big four-ring
wild animal circus, In saying "new"
show, it isn't inferred that the Barnes'
shm is new to the people of Lords
burg, for it has visited here before
nnd is strictly in keeping with the
truth tc say that it-, performances
always give genuine and wholesome'
satisfai lion.
Acts that thrill, acts that amaze,
other that instruct ,nnd those that
reato 'aughter all of them entirely
new and of an origina' character are
premised to those whf. witness this
season's performance, The scope of
the feats performed by the animals
has been profusely broadened for this
year's tour. Grown people will find
In the thrilling spectacular acts a
satiating array of entertainment,
while the kiddies will have bushels of
fun watching the antics of the half
hundred animal clowns. The comical
'ty of these laugh creators is also
guaranteed to be juvenescent to all
grandpas and grandmas present.
Special attention is directed this
year to the big wild animal features
in which the largest groups of lions,
tigers nnd bears over shown are performed.
