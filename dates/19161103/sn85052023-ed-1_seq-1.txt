Unusual Case on Docket of Lincoln
Circuit Court Which Convenes
Here Next Monday-
Prominent Workers From This Part
Of State To Be Guests of Stan-
ford Woman's Club
J
One of the most unusual suits
brought in Lincoln county in a long
time has been filed in the office of
-Circuit Clerk M. C. Newland here
and will come to trial at the Nov
ember term of the Lincoln circuit
court which begins here next Mon
day. It is an action for $15,000 dam
ages brought by Jones L. Anderson,
of the Preachersville section, against
Mrs. Eliza Herring, wife of Fisher
Herring, a promirent farmer just
over the Garrard county line, on the
Crab Orchard pike. Mrs. Herring is
close relative of Mr. Anderson. In
bis suit, Mr. Anderson asks for $15,
000 damages, charging that Mrs.
Herring "falsely and maliciously
spoke". of him, using such language
as to charge him with "grand lar
ceny and with being a felon." A
prominent array of attorneys has
been engaged on each side and the
suit will undoubtedly be hard fought,
not only on account of the promi
nence of the parties but on account
of the unusual nature of the action.
Attorneys P. M. McRoberts, of Stan
ford and L. L. Walker, of Lancaster,
brought the suit for Mr. Anderson,
and it is understood that Attorneys
K. S. Alcorn, of Stanford and J. E.
Robinson, of Lancaster, have been
engaged to represent the defendant.
Suit for $25,000 damages has been
brought against the L. & N. railroad,
for the death of Mrs. Margaret
Deatherage, who was killed by an
engine at the Rowland crossing sev-ei-al
months ago. The suit is brought
in the name of Alfred Deatherage
tv Attorneys H. C. Faulkner and Son
and W. A. Stanfill, of Hazard. The
charge is made in the petition that
the engine which struck Mrs.
Deatherage. an aged woman, did not
ring its bell or blow the whistle for
the crossing.
The number of civil suits filed at
the present term is unusually large,
and of varied interest. E. F. Spears
&. Sons, the hemp buyers of Paris,
through Attorney J. S. Owslev have
brought suit against James McCor
mack and J. S. and A. W. Holtzclaw,
charging violation of contract to
sell hemp to 'them. The number of
suits for divorce is also unusually
large.
An interesting suit in colored cir
cles of Stanford is the suit of Edmond
Lillard, Marie Hiatt, Babe Lillard
ard Martha Lillard against Dr. W. D.
Tardif for $100 damages for keep
ing th,em out of possession of a house
and lot they own on Waterworks
Sfr,..?'- -,,M which he occupies. T. J.
Hi", Z:.. is their lawyer.
I"- oxrected that court, which
c --.' ci Monday, will be adjourned
r- ' --til Wednesday, on account of
luf-'ay being election day.

Around 20,000,000 happy firesides the fathers of America -will
gather this nfght with their unbroken family circle, with their children
upon their knees and their wives by their side, happy and prosperous.
Contrast this with the fathers, husbands and brothers of the Old World
dying in the ditches, with the gloom and mourning in broken family
circles, where hunger crouches and disease treads. If this he "evil
and aciliating," God prosper it and teach it to the rulers of the old

To Get Election Returns
Result of Presidential Race To
Be Told at Opera House
So much interest is being ex
pressed in the result of the
general election over the na
tion next Tuesday that the I.
J. will "hold its next issue
Tuesday, until after the polls
close, and an idea can be ob
tained as to who has been elect
ed president. Four years ago
the I. J. was the first news
paper in this section to go out
with news of Wilson's election.
It will endeavor to come out
early Wednesday morning with
the full and final result, catch
ing the early morning trains
and rural routes out of Stan
ford. Election returns will be ob
tained from the Courier-Journal
News Bureau Tuesday
night, and will be made pub
lic that night at the Stanford
opera house to all who are
present. The regular Para
mount picture show will be
given also, the picture being
Hazel Dawn in "The Sales
Slides showing results in vari
ous states and bulletins as fast
as they are received will be
thrown on the canvas between
pictures, or as rapidly as the
returns come in. This will be
the only place where election
returns will be given out in
Stanford. Manager Foster
has made an exceptionally low
charge for admission, 25 cents
admitting to both the picture
show and election returns. It
H
is expected that a large num
ber from Stanford and sur
rounding towns will be on
hand to hear the vpturns and
take in the show. There will be
no reserved seats, but a gener
al admission of 25 cents to all
will be charged.

, Flood Of Oratory
Closes Campaign In Lincoln Franks
And Speer Speak Here
The presidential campaign in Lin
coln is closing with a flood of ora
tory this week. The feature of the
campaign as far as the republicans
are concerned was the speech made
at the courthouse here Thursday
night by Hon. E. T. Franks, of Ow
ensboro. Mr. Franks is one of the
big men of the party in Ketnucky,
and a very persuasive and convincing
speaker, if one is not familiar with
the other side of the question. He
was greeted by a good sized crowd,
in which the colored brother largely
predominated, and he stirred them up
considerably with his perfervid styJe
of oratory.
Banking Commissioner George G.
Speer, of Frankfort, delivered a
splendid speech on behalf of the Dem
ocratic ticket at Crab Orchard Wed
nesday afternoon. He was introduced
by H. G. Skiles and made a telling
argument. One of the best night
crowds of the campaign was at King's
Mountain Thursday night where
Judge Hardin and Hon. C. C. Bagby,
of Danville, spoke to the Woodrow
Wilson Club, which is working en
thusiastically, led by Dr. C. M.
Thompson. This club has in its mem
bership a number who have hitherto
always voted the republican ticket,
and they claim that King's Mountain
will roll up an unusual democratic
majority next Tuesday.
Every thing is in readiness for the
battle of the ballots next Tuesday.
The ballots have been printed and de
livered and if the weather continues
good, an unusually large vote is an
ticipated. Returns from Lincoln
county, Kentucky and the nation will
be received at the Stanford opera
house that evening, and it is possible
that it will be known who is elected
president before midnight.

her lecture was full of good things

be arranged some time in the near
future.
