BROKE INTO STORE,
Three Suspects Arrested Charg
ed With Breaking Into Store at
East Kyegate.
James Brown and Peter Roskin,
claiming Colorado as their residence,
and William Burke of Bridgeport,
Conn., were arrested in the railroad
yard at Woodsville, N. H., Monday
on a charge of breaking and enter
ing the store of George H. Wallace
at East Ryegate early Monday 'morn
ing. The men were arraigned in
municipal court and placed under
bonds of $1,000 for appearance at
the December term of Caledonia
county court. The booty obtained
in the break consisted of 51 cents
and some cigars and cigarettes, but
the case is complicated from the fact
that the postoffice is located in the
Wallace store and the government
may take up the matter.

JOHN W. THURSTON
HALLOWEEN PRANKS.
The Spirit of Witchery Prevails
and Movable Property in the
Village Changes Place.
Halloween sprites were out in
force Tuesday night and their pass
ing through the village was evidenced
by the general mix-up of property
that was not securely anchored or
guarded. Grocery stores and banks
displayed shingles, commons were
made dumping places for boxes and
refuse, warehouse trucks were hoist
ed up flagpoles, milk cans were scat
tered around residences and the
mischief which these sprites ran into
was legion. However, no great
damage was done, but the dignity of
the village fathers was somewhat
shocked when viewing the inharmon
ious arrangement of property.
Come to remember, a good many of
us were boys once upon a time.
' TWO BEAKS.
Shot by Willie Castonguay
Brought into the Village Last
Week.
An old bear and cub were shot last
week Friday by Willie Castonguay,
in the Gore about six miles from Is
land Pond village, and brought to
the village, where they were viewed
by a large number. Mr. Castonguay
has been very successful this season
in capturing bears, these two making
four that he has shot this fall.
Reports indicate that bears are
plenty in the wild lands, and hunters
are frequently bringing them in to
the villages.

CLOTHING CAUGHT FIRE.
Mrs. Elmer Davison Died from
Burns, Her Clothing Catching
Fire from Kerosene Lamp.
Mrs. Elmer Davison was burned
to death Friday night at her late
home in Brighton on the George
Currier farm. The particulars of
this accident are meager for no one
was present or saw Mrs. Davison
when her clothing caught fire. After
supper Mr. Davison went to the barn
to do the chores and on his return
found the charred and unrecogniza
ble body of his wife in the shed.
Life was extinct and the body cold.
A search through the rooms indicat
ed that Mrs. Davison's clothing
caught fire in the dining room.where
the curtains were burned, the wall
paper and floor blackened by the
flames. From this room Mrs. Davi
son made her way through the
kitchen to the shed, where she was
found dead by her husband.
This is a particularly sad case for
no one was present to assist her in
her efforts to put out the flames.
Before leaving the house Mr. and
Mrs. Davison chatted and laughed
over the day's happenings, having a
genial time and never thinking of
the sad accident soon to take one of
them away.
The funeral was held from the
home Monday at 10 o'clock, Rev. O.
E. Barnard officiating and burial at
East Charleston.
Mrs. Davison was the daughter of
Charles and Ellen Canning of Char
leston. She was about 3i years of
age and held in high esteem. She
was very active in the affairs of her
home and a great help to her hus
band in the cares of the farm, as
sisting him in looking after the busi
ness management and keeping her
home. They had no children. Be
sides the husband she is survived by
a large family of brothers and
sisters.
The husband and relatives have
the sympathy of all in this singularly
sad death and the great sorrow that
has come to this home.
