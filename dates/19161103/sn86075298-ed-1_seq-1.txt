GERMANS STOP
RUSSIAN DRIVE
London, Oct. 30.-A heavy offensive
was attempted by the Russians against
the German lines on the Stokhod riv
er in Volhynia, but was put down by
the German curtain of fire, according
to Berlin. This offensive has been ex
pected in an attempt on the part of
the Russians to relieve the pressure
on Roumania.
While Berlin reports all Russian at
tempts checked, Petrograd tells of suc
CEssful reconnaissances by, the Rus
sians along the River Stavok, a tribu
tary to the Stokhod.
The Roumanians and Russians in
Dobrudja are still in retreat before
the German, Bulgarian and Turkish
troops and are endeavoring to make
their way across the Danube at vari
ous points on pontoon bridges, accord
ing to the Sofia war office.
Russians Make Some Progress.
On the Transylvania front the Rus
sians and Roumanians apparently are
operating successfully against the
Teutonic allies near the junction of
Bukowina, Transylvania and Rouma
nia, and to the south near Campulung
and in the Jiul villey have gained suc
cesses over them.
In the fighting in the Jiul valley the
Roumanians are declared by Bucharest
to have captured two howitzer batter
ies, which later were turned against 2
the Austro-Germans. According to
Berlin the Teutons have made addi
tional gains south of Kronstadt and 1
in the direction of Campulung. ]
Following up their advantage of the I
'previous day the British captured an
other German trench northeast of Les
Boeufs in the Somme region, while
the French made fresh advances near
Sailly-Saillisel and Bieches. In Les
Boeufs sector two British "tanks"
were destroyed by German artillery
fire, according to Berlin. ,
The Macedonian theater is still the
scene of somewhat vigorous fighting,
especially the bend of the Cera river.
Both sides claim victories in this re
gion.
Except for bombardments the bad
weather on the Austro-Italian front is
beeping down the operations.

TREASURER'S OFFICE IS
BEST IN THREE STATES
The following interview appeared
in the Daily Missoulian of recent date.
"A. E. Pinney, auditor and adjuster
for the Fidelity and deposit company
of Maryland has just completed his
annual audit of the office of the county
treasurer and reports that the office
is in splendid condition and that in se
curing a maximum of efficiency with a
minimum of expense the office stands
in advance of any other in the three
northwestern states which comprise
his jurisdiction.
He states that figures he has com
I piled for his report show that in the
past six years from 1910 to 1916 in
clusive, the office has been charged
with taxes amounting to $2.810.222.50
and of this immense sum only $9.308.
65 is now delinquent which is equiva
lent to approximately one third of one
per cent.
The miscellaneous collections during
the same period were $1.086.153.19
making the total money handled by
the office -$3.887.067.04
The expeness during the six years
were $46.058.93 which shows that the
expense of collection was less than
twelve cents per thousand dollars
while in the state of Washington the
best record made by any county trea
surer was nineteen cents per thousand
dollars.
The splendid record in the treasur
er's office in this county was only made
possible by a most capable office force
and too much credit cannot be given
Mr. Buford, the chief deputy, who has
proven himself capable of handling a
great volume of work and one of the
most efficient men in the county.
Where an office can handle this
volume of business with only one
deputy during the greater part of the
year, the fitness of the deputy is
clearly demonstrated and the tax pay
ers of the county should feel proud
of this record."
Mr. J. W. Buford, the present chief
deputy in the county treasurers office,
is the democratic candidate for, trea
surer of Missoula county at next
Tuesday's election. His candidacy is
being made on the record of the
office in the past two years for effi
ciency and economy.-Adv.

WOMEN OPPOSE
fPRESS WILSON
ig Miss Lucy Burns; one of the lead
ig ing women of the country, is cam
in paigning in Montana against Presi
Ad dent Wilson and the national Demo
it cratic candidates because of the demo
ie cratic party's unfair treatment of
ie women. Miss Burns is pointing out in
i- her addresses that President Wilson
is has not only turned a deaf ear to en
n treaties from the women of the East
st and South, who are politically not free
s, but that he has refused to answer
a appeals from the voting women of the
ie west that justice be meted out to the
ie mothers of our land.
in "Voting women will, at this elec
is tion," says Miss Burns, "speak to
President Wilson and his party in a
,. language that they can understand.
sr If logic cannot move the party in
g power, then loss of votes may."
1. In a statement issued by Miss Burns
h from the Montana headquarters, she
e scores the president for his failure to
n use his influence to pass the Susan
. B. Anthony amendment in the last
? session of congress and urges the
a Montana women to vote in a body
t against him and his party to show the
r loyalty of women to women. Miss
e Burns, in commenting upon the fact
s that Wilson supporters are trying to
y becloud the national suffrage issued
, by calling attention to his one vote in
New Jersey for the hopeless state
, amendment, says:
"President Wilson did vote for
suffrage in New Jersey.
a "In Congress, where the chances for
a the success of woman suffrage were
1 good, he turned his whole party
it machine against it; in New Jersey,
f where-defeat was sure, he cast a soli
.- tary vote in its favor.
1e ,He did this after the congressional
d Union had campaigned - against the
.r democratic party in 1914 on this suf
frage issue; and after ten thousand
e men and women, gathered together at
e the closing session of the Woman
t Voters' Convention in September, 1915
had despatched messengers to the
g president to tell him that women
s would put the enfranchisement of
d their sex above the interest of any
r national political party.
s "A vote for suffrage in New Jersey
n helped the president's case with wo
men voters, and did not bring votes
for women in the east one step nearer.
1'The national activities of the suf
frage movement in every part of the
- Union had pushed the president to the
states' rights position--that comfort
able halting place at which profess
- ional politicians are wont to declare
that they are withheld from giving
you any help whatever by their de
votion to the constitution or their
passion for local self-government."
"Once arrived at this point, on what
ground could the president have re
fused to vote for woman suffrage
when it came up witnin his own state?
"His vote for suffrage in New Jer
sey was a cold political necessity.
"In announcing that he would sup
port suffrage in 1915, President Wil
son gave out a chilly statement, de
voted far more to his opposition to
suffrage in congress than his support
of it in New Jersey. He said, in part:
I "I intend to vote for woman suffrage
in New Jersey because I believe that
the time has come to extend that
privilege and responsibility to the
women of the state; but I shall vote
Not As The Leader Of My Party In
The Nation, But Only Up on My'
Private Conviction As A Citizen Of
New Jersey called upon by the legis
lature of the state to express his con
victions at the polls.'
"Why should the record of Mr. Wil
son, a 'citizen of New Jersey' be of
fered to the voting women of the
west? WOMEN OF MONTANA!
VOTE FOR THE FREEDOM OF THE
WOMEN OF AMERICA!"
THREE BORDER MEN
HELD AS UNNEUTRAL
Nogales, Oct. 30.-Three men were
arrested here charged with violating
the United States neutrality law. They
were Guillermo Barnett, Charles Kis
selbach and Eduardo Ramlerez, all of
the Nogales Hardware company. Or
ders were issued for the arrest of
Louis Looae, manager of the company,
on the same charge, but the latter was
out of town.
Ranmierez and Kisseibach gave bond.
Barnett was reported to hatye been ar
rested on the Moxicni side of the bor
der. A John Doe warrant was, issued
for an employe of the company named
Steinfeld, who was reported to have
delivered ammunition.
Funston Aware of Plot.
San Antonio, Tex., Oct. 30.-The ar
rest of alleged conspirators at No
gales, Ariz., was no surprise to Major
General Funston, who declared he had
known for some time of the plot to
smuggle arms across the Mexican bor
der.
Dozen Hurt in Texas Wreck.
Dallas, Tex., Oct. 30.-More than a
dozen passengers were injured when
the northbound Texas Special on the
Missouri, Kansas and Texas railway
was derailed at Lancaster, twelve
miles south of here. Three cars left
the track. Spreading rails are said
to have caused the accident.
SLAP AT U. S. IS
NOW REPUDIATED
Washington, Oct. 30.-What prom
ised to be a new source of serious
friction between the United States
and the defacto government of Mexico
apparently was cleared away through
formal repudiation by Eliseo Arre
dondo, Mexican ambassador designate,
of a statement issued here under the
name of Luis Cabrera assailing the
American government for permitting
aid to readc Villa and other bandits
from this side of the border.
Mr. Arredondo will go to the state
department with the explanation that
the statement was put out by an em
ploye of the Mieican news bureau, the
de facto government's semi-official pub
licity agency, without the knowledge
or consent either of the embassy or
Mr. Cabrera.
Another Denial Ready.
Department officials said this would
be accepted and would be regarded as
closing the incident.
While at the department, Mr. Arre
dondo said on special instructions from
his government he will deny also the
authenticity of what it is understood
will purport to be quotations from
General Carranza, General Obregon,
the Mexican war minister, and Gener
al Pablo Gonzales, commander of the
forces in Mexico City, reflecting
strong anti-American sentiments which
are expected to appear in an American
weekly magazine.
Information reaching the embassy
recently concerning the magazine ar
ticle caused an exchange of messages
with Mexico City and brought the am
bassador authority to repudiate them
in advance.
Until word of Mr. Arredondo's ac
tion and of Mr. Babrera's repudiation
at New York cause to them, the heais
of the state department had taken a
most serious view of the statement at
tributed to Cabrera, who, besides be
ing Carrauza's minister of finance, is
chairman of the Mexican group of
joint commissioners now sitting at At
lantic City.
Question of Veracity.
How the statement originated has
been the subject of much speculation,
and apparently has narrowed down to
a question of veracity between Mr.
Cabrera and the member of the news
bureau staff who gave it to the press.
The employe who issued the state.
ment was George F. Edmunds, pub
licity representative of the embassy
until the bureau was organized. Ed
munds asserts that the statement was
dictated to him at Atlantic City by
Cabrera., who authorized him to make
it public.
The appearance of the statement
created consternation with the em
bassy. Mr. Arredondo promptly had a
conference with Mr. Cabrera over the
long distance telephone.
Later he explained that the bureau
had prepared and issued without au
thority the statement, as a result of
remarks made by Cabrera Friday to
a representative of the bureau. He
said Cabrera made no unpleasant ref
erences to the American government,
and, moreover, was not expecting his
remarks to be quoted.
The Hughes smile is beginnaig to at
tract favorable attention.
President Entertains Five Progres
sives. - Headline. Others he simply
amuses.
Democratic papers chide Hughes be
cause he says he is "100 per cent a
candidate." The Wilson papers natur
ally prefer a fifty-fifty candidate.
The president says he has no interest
in any political party "except as an in
strument of achievement." If that's
it then how did he happen to select
such a poor instrument as the Demo
cratic party?
LIE IS PASSED
ON "FIXED" NOTE
New York, Oct. 30.-Emphatic de
nial of having stated, as charged by
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts, that
President Wilson had eliminated a
postscript from the second Lusitania
note only when members of his cabi
net threatened to resign if it were
included, was made by Henry C.
Breckenridge, former assistant secre
tary of war, in a telegram sent to the
Philadelphia Public Ledger and made
public here by the Democratic nation
al committee.
Wilson Not Threatened.
Breckenridge's telegram filed at San
Mateo, Cal., as given out by the com
mittee, follows:
"Any one who quoted me to Sena
tor Lodge, as represented In your tele
gram as quoted, is a scoundrel. No
member of President Wilson's cabinet
ever threatened him on any subject.
"The malice that would seek for
partisan advantage to emasculate the
potency of one's government in a vital
international affair by the mongering
of back stairs gossip is beneath con
tempt."
Another denial of Senator Lodge's
assertion was contained in a .message
received at Democratic headquarters
from David F. Houston, secretary of
agriculture.
Bailey Stands Firm.
Boston, Oct. 30.-A reaffirmation of
the truth of his statement that Henry
ireckenridge bad told him President
Wilson had eliminated a postcripli
from the secod Lusitajia note after
sevral memberii of his cabinet threat
ened to resign if it were included was
made by Dr. Charles .H filey a pro
fessor a the Tufts medical se oot &.
lccordinj to a statemej
the Repubi~can state comiint~ee, Dr.
Bailey replied that his letter as reed
by Senator .. odgei was "a fair'and not
at all exaggerated" story of' his con
versation with Breckinridge.., o
Denial Was Expected.
The committee's statement added:
"Dr. Bailey said in his reply that
he expected there would be denials
all around, but that he affirmed the
truth of his letter, and called attention
to the fact that Mr. Breckenridge had
made no denial of the most important
feature of the letter, which said that
President Wilson. without the knowl
edge of any member of his cabinet ex
cept Secretary Bryan, had added a
postscript to the Lusitania note, say-'
ing that the German government was
not to put too serious an interpreta
tion on the words, 'Omit no word or
act.' "
Senator Lodge said that if he had
anything further to say on the sub
ject lie would do so at an address in
Fitchburg.
