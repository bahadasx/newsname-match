The heart of every true Mississ
ippian throbbed with sorrow the
other day when the sad tidings
came from Memphis that Ho
Charles Scott, soldier, statesman
and prince of gentlemen, had
passed away.
There can be no eulogy, spoken
' or written, commensurate with
the ability, energy and devotion
. Charles Scott gave to his beloved
state.
Mississippi was proud of this
distinguished son, and he deserved
Honors at her hands far greatei
than were ever bestowed.
Charles Scott was a truly great
man great in intellect, great in
heart, great in all things that
make for better in this world. He
was not a politician, in the ordin
ary meaning of that word, and
was for this reason, perhaps, that
he did not win the hearts of the
masses, but no man ever loved
Mississippi with a greater and
more unselfish love, or more truly
desired to serve thje be3t interests
of the commonwealth. He was
always serene, self-poised in vie
tory and defeat alike, he always
stood for right principles, and he
lovea the truth too well to de
scend to the flimsy trickeries of
the demagogue.
Charles Scott was by birth,
training and inherent nature a
gentleman. He could not have
been otherwise. The great delta
section of our state is notable for
its production of such men, but it
y has never given the state a finer
i type than was presented in this
) soldier statesman. Both in pub
lie and private life the noblest
altruism governed his act. He
was imbued always with a con
scientious desire .to promote the
best interests of his state, and to
lend a helping hand to every
worthy cause. He loved to help
and do kind deeds.
In every field of human activity
that engaged his talents Charles
Scott was a success. He was both
an able lawyer and a cuccessful
planter. For many ynars he wp.s
recognized as Mississippi's fore
' most tiller of the soil. He was
devoted to agriculture. With
him the business of planting was
not merely a Drealwinning occu
pation. He felt that agiiculture
was sne mainstay of tne state
and the farmer the most import
ant economic factor in the life
the nation.
Dunnes ococc was not only an
able lawyer but a tireless student
His reading was broad. It em
braced every field of thought
irom the history of nations he
never failed to find useful lessons
In philosophical literature he
took especial delight. Hi3 chosen
profession the law had in him
a most conscientious and untiring
N memoer. ma keen, analytica
habit of thought made him resist
less both before judge and jury,
Although an intrepid soldier,
the bravest among the brave,
Charles Scott had one of those big!
generous natures mat love peace
ana oraer ana harmony. He was
a kindly ' man, and yet he could
strike and strike hard, in what
he believed to be a righteous
cause, lie inspired respect, even
among nis oitterest political ene
raies, and when aroused he moved
with a dynamic directness and
precision that was truly discon
certmg to his opponents. Had he
used the tricks and the wiles of
the demagogue, so common in our
public life of today, in combina
tioc with his great force and
ability, auy office within the gift
of the people could nave been his
The pathetic thing about the
passing of this man is that we are
not producing any more of his
breed. He belonged to a class
tnat is weii-nign extinct in our
commonwealth. He was born
great and did not need to have
greatness thrust upon him in or
der to stand head and shoulders
above the crowd. Whenever he
appeared one knew intuitively
that this was no ordinary man.
His presence commanded immedi
ate and respectful attention, and
brought to mind those lines of Sir
Walter Scott:
"When as the Palmer came in hall,
Nor lord, nor knight waa there more
tall,
Or had a statelier step withal,
Or looked more high or keen."
In all of the elements that go to
make a full-grown, well-rounded,
red-blooded man, Mississippi has
never had a finer example than
Charles Scott. Such men do not

There are many voters who do
not understand what amendments
we are to vote on at the election
to be held the first Tuesday in
govern Der, says the East Mississ
ippi Times:
The citizens of Mississippi wil
vote on the repeal of three laws
in 1914 the voters of the state
ratified an amendment to the con
stitution providing for the initia
the
amendment was inserted into the
1 1 A 1 . .
urgamc law Dy tne legislature in
1816.
At the last session the legisla
ture passed three laws that
aroused considerable feeling
throughout the state. The laws
were:
l. Limiting the shipment of
whiskey to one quart and beer to
twenty four pints to one consumer
every fifteen days
2. Prohibiting newspapers from
publishing liquor advertisements.
3. Kegulating hunting and fish
ing and providing game wardens.
retitions were circulated de
manding an election on the three
aws, but before the Secretary of
State could issue a proclamation
calling an election the anti-saloon
eague secured an injunction from
the Chancery Court at Jackson
restraining the Secretary of State
from complying with the provi
sion of the constitution.
The State Supreme Court on
Oct. 9 dissolved the injunction
and directed the Secretary of
State to call the election. The
court held that the judiciary had
no authority to enjoin any election.
The Secretary of State issued a
proclamation naming Nov. 7 as
the date of the election.
The ballot which is to be voted

inches long and contains the three
amendments to the constitution

Each of the three are to be voted
upon separately.

Well, Doug, in forwarding my

long ago." It is written by
"Savoyard." Old timers will
remember him as a "erood bov"
who was on The Sun when Smith
owned and published it. (Smith
bought the paper from Jim Hay'

Smith (Geo. B. I think was his
name) you are bound to remem

and faithful woman as ever was

paper and ran Smith, when he
got too much." You remem

hurried to Mobile after him when
he was on one of his periodical
drunks, and brought him home
as straight as a string, and kept
him straight. Cudgel my brain
as I will, I cannot recall Savoy
ard's name. He and Sterling
Ivy were great friends. These
people were all Kentuckians.
Savoyard is now a Washington
correspondent for a number of
papers and his fame as a writer
is nation wide.
This clipping I got from the
60-page edition of the "States"
of Columbia, S. C
In the article Savoyard is rub-
