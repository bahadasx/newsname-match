M. HENRI QUITS DRINKING.
Eighty years ago Madame Henri had
no Idea that her f:tne would extend
from the lill: ie of Brittany in which
shelvted to all corners of France, or
that her namle would ever he spoken
in xwhispers by a naution's story-tollers.
She fully expected to had at quiet and
useful life. and in the end he, buried
with her forbears in the churchy~ard.
Slithe was a quit, practical wIiuin:n, ai
tinhe' housekeeper :td an excelient man
ager, anlil 'vt'vryiotdy resper'cted her.
When she w;is married niost of the
girls of the viillage envied her and per
haps a few lated her; for diiver. dunam
sels had made strenuous efforts to
callture tie yolune taln I iwho becanle
her husind. .1I. Henri was extremely
handsonle, and hal a hundred charins
and graces. lei was the best singer in
the countryside, he was full of witty
sfories. and the way he could dance
was a cautloL. Everybody admired the
young man. Well, it is true that the
old cure shook his head now and then,
when Henri was mentinedl. The young
man was too flighty, said that reverend
man. But the cure was hopeful when
he heard the name of Henri's bride.
This girl came of a thrifty family,
and she abhorred waste, without being
avaricious. She was distinguished for
her beautiful complexion, which re
minded people of cream and roses; and
her face was framed by masses of

curling brown hair. And she was cele
brated in her own neighborhood for
her physical strength. Without being
bulky or awkward, she had the power
Sf two ordinary men in her muscles.
The strongest man in the village was
as an infant in her hands when, to lend
interest to the evening sports, she con
sented to demonstrate her strength.
So Henri married this lovely and at
tractive girl. and they went to house
keeping, and for a while the husband
was a success, lie worked diligently,
and spent his. evenings at home, and
his wife managed so successfully that
money was being saved. But all the
time the young man hungered and
thirsted for the bright lights in the
tavern windows. And before long he
began making frequent trips to the
grog bazaar, and when he returned
home his breatlh spoke volumes. It
went from worse to worse, as it usu
ally does in such cases, and in a few
months Mudame Henri had to spend
her evenings alone. The husband was
holding high wassail at the Horn of
Plenty inn.
It was breaking her heart, and she
pleaded and argued with him, and even
threatened, and all to no avail. Henri
came reeling home nearly every night,
a spectacle for the gods.
Then a relative of hers died and left
her a comfortable legacy. She had
long known that this money would
come to her, and when she was mar
ried she and her husband had made
beautiful plans as to what they would
do with it. They'd buy a little farm
and live happy ever after. And now that
the legacy was hers, Madame Henri
made one last effort to arouse a sane
ambition In her husband. She implored
him to quit his foolishness and help
her carry out the original plans. He
seemed to be roused by her entreaties,
and promised her to refrain from the
elwVr bowl forever. He had sown his
last wild oat. She beUeved him, and
negotiated for a farm she had had her,
eyes on for a long time. Then one day
she handed hinm some money to take to
the notary who was conducting the
negotiation.
lie didn't take the money to the no
tary. lie took it to the Horn of Plen
ty. Late at night he returned to
his abode in merry humor. He opened
the door and entered, wearing a vacu
ous grin. Madame Henri rose from
her chair and faced him, and a hot
wave of anger swept over her. She
forg,'t her phenlomental strength when
> he struck him. lie fell to the floor
like a sack of meal, and she realized
that lie had ltken: his ,ast drink.
Silt succeeding days neighibors
paused, as usual, at Madame Hlenri's
garden gate, to gossip a bit. and she
volunteered the inforomatinu to all of
them that her husband had quit drink
ing and was going to settle down, lie
htd gone away to look at several prop
erties which were for salet, and she
tIlnt kt olx" when he'd be hack. After
wards the neighbors remermbredti that
she had harped upon this natter ini
sis ,ntly, bringing it up every time she
talked with them.
A quarter ot a mile away fromn the
Henri cottage thelre was a stream. alnd
upon the hank of this stream there
stood a gristmill. One rnornirng ai the
miller was going to his daily task, he
observed a queer-looking ,,bjectt on one
of the blades of the waterwheel. With
the help of : long pole, hooked at the
end. he pulled the thing off IIh water
wheel and brought it to land. It was
a coars' sack, 'ontaining sio etihing
heavy. He opened the sack :and hhi, ldi
a part of a human body. With his
dlusty hair on end, he went to the \ii
lage police station, ant t,h' oli'e.r in
charge aiccolidaanied hirn to the river
lhallk and inspected the ghastly discovy
ery.
"'This was done by a woman," said
the village sleuth. "Only a worltna
would have used a ne'dlite and thread
on :a sack. A nuan would have tietd It."
The 'tlarm was given, and the vil
lagers hielped to comb the stream, and
during the day vartious similar sacks
were found, all containing fragmtents
of a human body, and all sewn with
needle and thread. The head alone
couldnl't be found. and the head was
necessary to the identification of the
victim, and the solution of the mnys
tery. The days went by and no prog
ress xils made. but the village sleuth
studied and worried over it day and
night, and finally concluded that the ab
sence of SI. Henri would bear investiga
tion. So he disguised himself after the
manner of Vidocq and managed to be
comle well acquainted with Madame
Henri, and soon concluded that her sto
ries about her husband were false.
Then he accused her of his murder in
5so many words.
The madam, strong as she was, fell
in a sooon, and when She recovered
consciousness confessed everything.
After ending that her husband was
dtead, 9ie curried his body to the cel
lar, and there chopped him into con
venient chunks with an ax. The
pieces she sewed up In sacks. and ev
ery night, until the whole body was dis
posed of. she curried a bundle to the
riv.'r and threw it in.
Even when this was kn-,wn most of
the people sympathized with the wom.
an. knowing how mulch shle had en
dlured. The terrible story was carried
all over Europe, aid for weeks to
gether the nc\\ewspalrs were full of it.
:anid many years afterwards tourists
went out of their way to visit the cor
nt r of Brittany where Madame Henri
induced her husband to sign the
pledge.
The wouwu \\as tried and convicted
An due season, and was sentenced to
twenty years at hard labor.
Her Expansive Hat.
A wonman entered a car rather out
of breath and presented a singular
appearance, for instead of a hat she
was balancing a huge basket on her
head with as much grace and ease as
it it had been her Sunday bonnt. She
could just manage to get through the
doorway, but she sat down with the
basket gracefully poised on her head.
"All fares, please," said the con
ductor. "And I shall want twopeuce
for that there basket, tmum.'
"Get away with yer," she said. "D'ye
charge anything for ladies' hats?"
"No, mum."
"Thkh git on with yer work. This
'er basket is a-going to be my hat."

Many persons have declared
lthir ixptetaltioil of going there i
eventllill I. hiut th rl. are thou- t

pie do not go there.
The Purgatory iI quetioii is located I
in the town of <uttonl. Mass.. and those
who have visitedl the spot are con- I
vineed that the comlmonwoealth lhas
missed an opportunity to become fa- I
noius for having within Its confines one i
of the strangest and most Interesting 1
freaks of nature in the world.
Purgatory. In Sutton, is a chasm.
Its admirers declare that it Is more
attractive and remarkable even than
the Flume in the White mountains, and
they are back of a movement to have
the commonwealth acquire the prop
erty and make a reservation out of It
for the benefit of the whole 1peN,,'".
Purgatory chasm has for years bcn
a source of wonder to geologists, for
they cannot agree as to what causedI
it. A :lrge number of them seem to
think that at some tilme, eAns ago. a
portion of the earth at this point
dropped down out of sight. eyaving a
great chasm whose base is f!led with
giant howhllrs iandl deep caves.
Until a f: w years ago this chasm,
situated in the amidst of a forest of
pine, hemlilock and spruce, was a
favorite outinilg spot for people in
Worcester and surrounlldilng towns, bult
as the !,I ats to it were not kept in
good condition the visitors decreased
until now it has practically been for
gotten rxctpt by a few enthusiasts.
Explored by Commission.
Led Iy Arthur E. Seagrave of Ux
bridge, who is assistant attorney gen
eral of the commonwealth, they have
been endelavoring for several years to
have the legislature take an interest in
the matter of preserving the natural
wonder, and finally succeeded this
year in securing an appropriation of
$100 to be used for an investigation of
the matter by the state forestry com
mission. This commission, which is
composed of the state forester, Frank
W'. Rune, IIarold Parker and Harvey
N. Shepa:rd. with Charles 0. Bailey as
secretary, has completed its investiga
thye. Not one of them had ever seen
Purgatory chasm before.
"I was amazed." said Mr. Bailey
when he returned to Boston. "It ac

tually awed me, it was so majestic. so
w,iuhlerful. In some ways.it resembles
the List liver chasnm In Vermont. and
to nmy mmin is more interesting than
the Flume in New llampshire. After
going nearly a mile through the woods
you sudlenly come upon this freak.
There are stones weighing .a0 tons at
least that have been hurled abhout.
Some of them stick out at least 15 feet
from tile sides of the chasm. 40 feet or
more in the air. There are caves where
lee remains much of the summer, and
at the end if the chasm is at wonder
ful cave, on the floor of which is an
immense slab of stone that looks just
like a giant's cofin. It Is called the
Devil's Cave.
"The vegetation there is remarkable.
Great trees grow apnarently from the
solid rock, their roots often going up
10t to 15 feet over the bowlder, then turn
down over It to reach the soil. If a
balloonist should start from the Roty
mountains and land at this spot, he
i would think it was a part of the
Rockies. Speaking .s a private citi
zen. I believe it almuld be a great
shame to let a few dollars stand In
the way of preserving this great nat
ural wonder for the people of Massa
chusetts."
Some Great Caverns.
"Hell's Coal Bin" is one of the larg
est caverns In Purgatory, not far from
the northern entrance. It would hold
25 persons easily. The "Devil's Ice
Box" Is another great cavern. Its cell
ing lined with icicles until the npiddle
of June. "Pulpit Rock" Is a wedge
shaped piece 40 feet high, from which
many a sermon has been preached by
the unordained.
For all its ruggedness, the trip I.
through Purgatory chasm may be
made by women, although it is not a
place for silk hosiery and thin-soled
pumps.
Some of the rocks in the chasm are
as large as a hungalow, and the mass
of howlders extends far Into the earth.
It Is possible for one to go down into
great crevices until well out of sight
below the surface, and in other places
rocks may be dropped into other holes,
and they rattle from bowlder to bowl
der until the sound of their downward
progress is lost in the depths.
In spite of the ravages of forest fires'
in this section. the virgin wood sur
rounding the chasm for more than a
mile has not been harmed.
