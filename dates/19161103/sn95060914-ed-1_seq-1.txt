LAST WORD FOR
PRFSIDFNTWIISON
Charged with Every Conceiv
able Thing Awaits Ver
dict of Jury
FAME AND FORBEARANCE
Hat Won For President Wilson
An Exalted Place In
History
The case has gone to the jury
and their verdict will be render
ed next Tuesday President Wil
son has been on trial He has
been charged with being weak
and vacillating and with being
stubborn and headstrong with
being dilatory and using words
without deeds and with rushing
theEight hour Law through Con
gress without stopping for debate
or investigation deed without
words with having kept us out
of war at the expense of our
national honor and with having
not kept us at peace but getting
us into three wars one with ban
Domingo and two with Mexico
with having tamely submitted to
German y aggressions and sub
missively acquiesced in English
interference with our mails and
commerce and with having de
nied Germany her rights and hav
ing failed to enforce the rights
of the Allies and neutrals with
having ignobly refused to declare
war against Germany and with
having been equally ignoble in
declining to declare war on Eng
land with having brought the
country to the verge of ruin with
a ficticious temporary prosperity
raising the wages cf the work
ingman and shortening his hours
and increasing the price of agri
cultural products thus increasing
the cost of living
Vyith all humanitybewajlingL
the effectiveness of European p
diplomacy which failed to avert
war Wilsonsdiplomacyhas put
a stop to Germanys illegal use of
the submarine and laid the
foundation for a recovery in full
of all injury done American pro
perty rights by England or her
allies Words without deeds
certainly when words are diplo
macy and deeds are war and
diplomacy gains our point Pat
ient negotiation is not weakness
or vacillation firm insistence is
not stubbornness Immediate
action to avert a nationally dis
astrous strike is not a surrender
to force or headlong action with
out thought
Police work in San Domingo
and Mexico is not war Patience
with poor distracted struggling
Mexico patience with Germany
with the Allies all of whom are
engaged in a bitter war which
each believes to involve its very
existence is not weakness It is
the strength the forbearing
strength of a great a powerful
a noble nation
Prosperity which is all pervad
ing which brings up the price of
labor and the products of labor
and the products of labor manu
factured or grown from the soil
which gives work to all which
swells bank accounts particular
ly small savings banks which
puts all mills mines and factor
ies at work such prosperity is
not fictitious nor is it merely
temporary
Whatever the verdict of the
neonle next Tuesday may be the
present President of the United i
in history His task has been as
hard as Lincolns was and he
has performed it as Lincoln would
have done This and succeeding
generations of Americans have
cause to rejoice at the course
President Wilson has pursued and
the things he has accomplished
and the fearful things he has
prevented
He has nothing to fear from a
just people

TON CAMPBELL
NUMBER 38
A Fll FLUSHER
His Talk of Economy Is Pure
Bunk and His Record
Proves It
REDUCES HIS HIKE WES
On His Own Mine but FaTor
High Rate on Non-Producing
Mines
Tom Campbell states that if he
is elected governor he will ikm
solidate the offices of game
sealer of weights and mea
sures horticultural commission
and the live stock sanitary board
because one man can attend tn
all the offices
This is all pure bunk The
legislature will handle these de
partments If not needed abclish
them if needed have them lad
ministered properly Why does
he not say that he will abolish
the tax commission or load the
work of other departments on it
Campbell stated in a n scent
speech in Phoenix that the only
vacation he has had in eighteen
years has been his two years on
the taxcommission If the ivork
of this commission is a vacation
let him say he would load the
commission with more work He
dont do it because he expects to
continue on that commission after
January 1st If he does not ex
pect to sit on that commission
why does he not resign
His talk on abolishing offices is
in line with other bunk he gave
the public last year when he an
nounced in all the papers of the
State that if the courts by August
1st did not decide the veto of the
appropriation bill so that the tax
commission would have money to
carry on its work he would
be
found drawing hisTsalary without
vnnrnn v jci
ccuiiniB iu xet illttb case WHS
not decided until the last of De
cember and he did not resign
He says there are too many
clerks in the capital building yet
the minutes of the tax commis
sion show that he favored more
permanent help for that commis
sion See page 181 Book 2
Probably this extra help accounts
for his own vacation while on
that commission
His present talk about economy
is further denied by his record
found at page 255 Proceedings
of the State Tax Commission for
tne year laia At this time he
took the commission to task for
being niggardly about the ex
penditure of a few hundred dol
lars for this or that saying he
believed the commission had un
limited funds and why not use
them
A further evidence that his
economy talk is ail bunk is shown
by his record as county assessor
of Yavapai county Page 13 of
the 1913 report of the clerk of
the board of supervisors of that
county shows that the cost of
the assessors office was 6 215 25
Page 17 of the clerks report for
1915 the odd year for Mr Camp
bells successor shows the cost
of office to be 528141 or
100000 less For 1914 page
19 with Mr Campbell as assessor
it cost the county 569015 For
this year Mr Campbells suc
cessor does the work for
520000 about500001ess with
larger valuation more properties
and more people to assess Now
the facts are that while Mr
Campbell was supposed to be
working on the job as assessor
he was superintendent of a mine
at Jerome where he spent most
of his time
As tax commissioner he re
fused to raise the assessment
on his own mine the Jerome
Verde adjacent to the United
Verde while he favored the as
sessment of the Worlds Fail
Mine at 70000 per acre page
444 Book 2 Minutes of the Tax
Commission This mine is in
Santa Cruz county is not patened
and is not producing His mine
is selling stock on the open mar-

sessed at 3630
