As To Highway Engineer
Voters who want to express
preference on the county highway
engineer proposition will find two
lines at the. bottom of the ballot,
one reading: For the highway
engineer, act," and the other,
"Against the highway engineer
act.".. The act is now in effect in
this county and if you are in favor
of abolishing the office strike out
the first line ad vote "against the
highway engineer act." The office
as administered the past two years
has been a detriment :to" road im
provement, has not only hindered
road work bub' discouraged many
who heretofore . were active good
roads boosters and were liberal
contributors to the cause. Road
dragging has been dope by volun
tary contributions while the fund
created by taxing automobile own
ers was held up by a petty quarrel
between the county highway com
mission and the -state highway
commissioner. The highway en
gineer's salary is $900.00 per year
as regulated by the present county
court. '

ance Union of Linn county will

and call the voters attention to the
third amendment.
For Sheriff
The office of sheriff is one of the
most important in the county. By
nature and training Geo. W.
Anderson is especially fitted for
that office, has hd the experience
necessary 'to perform the duties
according to law and good judg
ment and naturally the sentiment
isstrong in all parts of the county
that he should, and will be elected.
.". " County Finances
Every county warrant issued
since last January has gone to
protest and the county is paying
interest on them. The county
treasury is flat broke. A change
is needed that will put some busi
ness efficiency into the county
court. The republicans of the
westerra district have put up a
candidate that has been successful
in his private business and has
pledged to use the same care and
diligence in the transaction of the
county's business. Reference is
made'to W. R. Sallee. A vote for
Sallee is a vote to put the
finances of the county on solid
footing and give a strict account of
every dollar expended. See that
W. R. Sallee is on your ticket.
