CADETS SWAMP VETS.
Beef No Match for Speed. Score
42 to 7.
The game Saturday between
the Freshmen team of the Kan
sas City Vets and Wentworth's
youngsters resulted in a one
sided score in favor of the
cadets. Wentworth kicked off
and in jig time took the ball
away from the Vets and scored
a touchdown. The cadet ma
chine worked with precision
everything went cross bucks,
fake kicks, end runs and line
bucks, world without end. at
the end of the first half the.
cadets were 20 to the good.
The second half was a repeti
tion of the first, except that the
Vet3 rallied and scored a touch
down. The rest was easy, and
found the cadets making 22
more points.
The Vets had the edge on
weight. They were a mighty
fine looking bunch of men, play
ed clean ball but lacked the agil
ity and training of their lighter
opponents. Mozley at quarter for
the cadets, was the star of the
game. He handled the team
without a bobble.

the best wishes of a large cir
cle of friends for a long, happy
and prosperous married life.
