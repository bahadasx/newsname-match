sources of the state banks are within

the history of the banks. They weret
then $135,907,019.12,
In this statement the New Orleans
banks show a decrease in resources
of $3,027,054.21 when their combined
assets dropped from $85,283,398.11 in
June, to $82,256.8343.90 at the present
time. This is due to the withdrawal
of deposits by the country banks and
others for crop moving purposes. The
country banks, on the other hand,
show a gain in resources of $5216,
.535.95. Their resources jumped from
$47,864,551.82 in June to a3,081,087.77
in September. The increased depos
its in the country banks as a result I
of high prices received for cotton, rice
and other products, account for most
of the gain in the resources of these
banks... Deposits in the country banks v

June 30.
The deposits of all kinds in the
country banks are now at their high

Washington.-Great Britain's note ci
reply to America's blacklist was
d at'the State Department. A
giments regarding its pulli- qi
will,.be made later. It is tinder- a
eo n of tf
rintances. b
The British note is in reply to the b
merican note of July 28, which de- a
pounced the blacklist as "an arbitrary U
interference with neutral trade," and s
r "inconsistent with that true justice,
sincere amity and impartial fairness
which should characterize the dealings
of friendly governments with one an- o
other." r
The names of some American firms C
already have been taken from the n
blacklist, and the British note is un- s
derstood to offer means of reviewing N
others. . c
The British note is understood to V
t take the line of argument that it is s
unprecedented for a neutral to claim n
that a belligerent should in effect com
pel its subjects to trade with the
enemy and that it violates no law for
the British government to prevent its C
subjects from doing so.
While the British government ad- n
mite the right of all persons in neu- c
tral countries to engage in legitimate d
commercial transactions, it argues n
1 that such a right does not limit the
g right of other governments to restrict b
e the activities of their own nationals.
SThe point at issue in tie controver-f
h sY is whether the nationality or the
d domicile of the owner of goods gives
0 character as neutral or belligerent.
L Previously Great Britain and the Unit
t ed States have agreed that domicile t
was decisive, regardless or nationality.
The continental European position
has been that nationality was decisive.
s In the previous negotiations over the r
L blacklist Great Britain took a posi
I- tion between the two theories.
t The subject probably will be carried r
a on in further diplomatic correspond
ence.
