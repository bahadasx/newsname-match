I larold Jeffs, the barber. Is under
arrest on suspicion of being respon
sible for the death of his wife yes
terday morning, lie was taken into
custody by Deputy Sheriff Julius W.
Asch immediately following a verdict
of the coroner jury which discred-
j iied the suicide theory. Upon the
prisoner's request the deputy prom
ises to allow him to attend, under
guard, the wife's funeral this after
noon.
Following testimony of Jeffs alleged
treatment of his wife for the last
a year, which was such that the regular
Kilice stenographer was excused from
wie jury ruuui unu a ms-ii uuuivcu
i in her place, the arrest of the hus
) band was no surprise to those who
-'. attended the trial, and from the lack
! of surprise which he showed, Jeffs
I himself apparently anticipated such
' action. " . :
Jury Renders Verdict.
In part the jury's verdict was that
Minnie Ixcke Jeffs, 40years old, born
In Newport, England, came to her
death November,, at her home, 1381
South Beretanla street, from a bullet
wound of the brain from a .22 caliber
rifle held in thediand or hands of some
person to the jury unknown. '
Dr. George Herbert told of being
called to the Jeff home, of finding-the
J. rifle ln! Mrs. Jeffs' hands and of being
' present when the died, and Jeffs re
lated a story similar to the one in
' ' the StaBulleUn1 Thursday. Attorney
Ieon M. Straus, however, who had
! been recently retained to prepare for
Mrs. Jeffs a divorce complaint, prov-
ed to be the "star' witness, and
under command from Deputy Sheriff
I Asch and Deputy Prosecuting Attor-
ney W. T. Carden, gave testimony
against Jeffs, so revolting as to be un
believable. V .
Lawyer Kegels Woman's Charges
Tho Inhuman, bestial and unnatur
al crimes with which she charged her
husband when she asked me to pre
, pare divorce papers were so horrible"
w. , said Straus, prefacing the reading of
the papers in question to the jury.
"that I required her to write them out
and swear to them before a witness be
fore I would take her case."
Straus then read to the jury the
statement which Mrs. Jeffs had wrtt-
ten and signed, and the complaint
which he had drawn up and was on
the point of filing In court when her
, death took place. The attorney stat-
that tho acts alleged In thecom-
alnt were bo nauseating that a fore
's med woman ttenographer who at-
empted to take the dictation in the
Tirfsf nee of Straus and Mrs. Jeffs
Ahrew down her pencil and refused,
Tven though a public "Stenographer, to
ccntinue. The stenographer was call
ed, with her notes, to the Inquest this
morning " and corroborated Straus'
statement. She promises to trans
cribe the notes, as far as she then
. . took them.
Jeffs Story Changes Some
Although Jeffs story this morning
wVs practically the same as the one
tho deputy sheriff says Jeffs told yes
terday morning there was a slight tut
material change. The deputy v says
'Jeffs said yesterday that he' could
have taken the gun away from the
woman before she fired had he tried,
but at the inquest he said that the
fatal shot was fired almost instantly
V after he had found his wife In his ted
with the gun to her temple and before
he could make any move to take it
away from her. When asked by the
deputy why he made a different state
ment yesterday, Jeffs hesitated .and
mumbled something to the effect that
"she didn't have a desperate look on
her face and I didn't think she would
shoot"
Several startling statements which
Jeffs made today included one that
Mrs. Jeffs had threatened several
times to commit suicide, he havlmj
taken the rifle away from her when
she once attempted to do so; another
(that she was addicted to the use of In
. Aixicatlng liquors to what he believed
Lto be an excess, and also that she had
often told him the house in which
they lived was unlucky and that both
he and she were kahunaed.
When the verdict was received by
Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Carden
he ordered Jeffs into custody to be
held for Investigation.
For a general discussion on the
bond Issue which, will be voted on No
vember 7, residents of Puunut and
Alewa heights will meet this even
ing at 7:30 o'clock at the home of

Honolulu was honored last night by

With the addition of the Wheatstone

in the Marconi office here, old-time
operating becomes a thing of the past
and the keymen gladly take up their

checking the work of the machine. An
apparatus with an ordinary typewriter

the operation of the tape perforator
and therefore the whole new system
