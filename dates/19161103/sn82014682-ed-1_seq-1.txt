. -
Charges Made By Mrs. Jeffs for
Use in Divorce Proceedings
She Purposed to Bring Had
She Lived Are Considered By
Police as Furnishing Motive
for Crime
Harold Jeffs, the barber. Is under
arrest on suspicion of being respon
sible for the death of his wife yes
... terday morning. He Was taken Into
custody by Deputy Sheriff Julius W.
Asch immediately following a verdict
the- coroner's Jury which dlscred
lTttl the suicide theory. Upon the
nrlsoner's reauest the deputy prom
ises . to allow him to attend, under
guard, the wife's funeral this after-
' noon. ". : '..
Following testimony of Jeffs alleged
treatment of his wife for the last
year, which, was such that the regular
police stenographer was excused from
the Jurjr room and a man substituted
in her place. -the arrest of the hus
band was no surprise to those who
attended the trial, and from the lack
of surprise which he showed, Jeffs
himself , apparently anticipated, such
action. r-
Jury Render Verdict;
In par the jury's .verdict waa that
Minnie Locke Jeffs,40. years old, born
ia Newport,: England, came to her
death NoVember 2r at her home, 1381
South Beretania street, rrom a bullet
wound of the brain from a .22 caliber
rifle held in the hand or hands of some
person to the Jury unknown. ,
Dr. George Herbert told of being
- called to the Jen's home, of finding the
rifle la Mrs. Jelis' hands and of being
present when she died, and Jeffs re
lated a story similar to the one in
the Star-Bulletin Thursday. -Attorney
' Leon M. Straus, however, who had
been recently retained to prepare for
Mrs. Jeffs a divorce complaint,' prov
ed to be . the "star" witness, and
under command, from Deputy Sheriff
Asch and Deputy Prosecuting Attor
ney W. T. Carden, gave testimony
against Jeffs, so revolting as to be un
believable. Lawyer Meads Woman's Charges - ' ' .
The inhuman, bestial ana unnaiur
at crimes with which she charged her j
hu6band when she asked me to pre
, - - . . . . - .
pare divorce papers were so norriDie,
said Straus, prefacing the reading of
rQie papers. in question to. the Jury,
hat required Jier to write them out
fore I would take" her case' I
Straus then read to the Jury the ,
statement which Mrs. Jeffs had writ-j
ten and aigned, and the complaint
which he had drawn up and was cn
the point of filing in court when her J
death took place. The attorney stat
ed that the acta alleged In the com
plaint were so nauseating that a fore
warned woman stenographer who at
tempted to take the dictation in the
presence of Straus and Mrs. Jeffs
threw down her pencil and refused,
even though a public stenographer, to
continue. Hie stenographer was call
ed, with her notes, to the inquest this
imrning . and corroborated Straus
statement. She promises to trans
cribe the notes, as far as she then
took them.
Jeff' Story Changes Some
Although Jeffs' Btory this morning
was practically the same as the cne
the deputy sheriff says Jeffs told yes
' terday morning there was a slight but
material change. The deputy says
Jeffs said yesterday that he could
have taken the gun away from the
woman before she fired had he tried,
liit at the Inquest he said that the
fatal hot was fired almost instantly
after he had found his wife in his bed
with the pftn to her temple and before
he could make any move to take it
away from her. When asked by the
deputy why he made a different state
mt.r.t vAsterdav. Jeffs hesitated and
tniimhipd RomethinK to the effect that
Vshe didn't have a desperate look cn
her face and I didn't think she would
shoot"
Several startling statements which
. Jeffs- made today Included one that
mm jAffa had threatened several
times to commit suicide, he having
taken the rifle away from her when
she once attempted to do so; another
that she was addicted to the use of in
toxicating liquors to what he believed
to be an excess, and also that she had
often told him the house in which
they lived was unlucky and that both
he and she were kahunaed. .
When the verdict .was received ,by .
Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Carden
he ordered Jeffs into custody to be
held for investigation. 7 j

Ahin may be prosecuted.
With the . preparations to arrest
Ahin; the threatened legal fight over
the closing , of the disorderly district
Is ccmlng to a focus. The citizens'
committee Is prepared to fight the
cares through the courts If the vice
landlords decline to close their houses
and oust the women of Ill-fame. The
first hearing on these cases will prob

Information has reached the Star

while several landlords have closed or
are closing their houses, they are pot

;t is declared that several of them
have promised to help Ahin stand the
expenses of - a legal fight and that a
fund is being raised to pay for' the
security he wishes to obtain. Some of
these landlords are said to be afraid
to fight their own cases because of
the notoriety involved, but are will

Honolulu was honored last night by
being selected as the first place in the

found 100 per cent efficient and per
manently installed as a part of the

Not content with making Honolulj
the "Popping Place of the Pacific"
through which the messages or the
world will shortly travel on to Japan,
V. A. WInterbottom and Edward O.
Fllisbury, the two Marconi men who
bave been In Honolulu for some time
putting the big-Kahuku and Koko

ness of the world, have selected the
capital of Hawaii for an initial ven

posed to do la nearly past comprehen

In the. most casual manner the ac
cumulated mass of. the Marconi's night
business was perforated, transmitted
to San Francisco, received there and
an 0 K" flashed back when the last
word had sped over the Pacific .spaces
just 40 minutes after the sending
Ptarted The desirability of this pro
cedure may be appreciated by compar
ing it with the : old process,- which
would baveUaken an hour and a hall
or two hours, with possible mistakes,
"fthile the messages sent by the ma
chine were absolutely perfect and
errorless. The manual work of the
operators at the. Kahuku wireless sta
tion is also eliminated, . r
Greater Speed Possible !
. TheWheatstoen transmitter was set
last night to send about: 30 wo rds a
minute, as the man on the CMtom
receiving end could "write" no faster.
But as soon as the method of receiving
on phonographic records Is installed
in the near future in California ty
WInterbottom and PiUsbury, the speed
of sending may be increased to 120
words a minute with no lessening of
accuracy and efficiency, and the re
ceiving records, after reception, slo
ed down to a speed in tune with the
t.nM.on th tvnewriter and
transcribed at leisure by any numbfr
of operators.
The Marconi officials have been ex
perimenting with the new method for
two weeks and have found it flawless

MAYOR TALKS ON
DOND ISSUES AT
Effort to Head Off Speaker at
Republican Meeting Fails;
Applause Follows
LANE EXPOUNDS IN
FULL BOND PROJECT
Towse Attempts to Stop Talk
and Later Says Agreement
Was Violated
Kaimukl last night stood proudly
for free speech, as well as showed that
.h; people of the district believe in
public discussion of such an Import
ant public question as the bond issue.
This was demonstrated at the Repub
lican rally at IJHuokalani school
house when Mayor Lane, an Invited
speaker, after-discussing the legisla
tive election issueB. launched into a
strong appeal to the voters to support
the bond Issue. '' :
Mayor Lane had scarcely started oh
the bond matter when Ed Towse ad
vanced from the rear of the platform
with upraised hand and commanded
the mayor to stop.- As the orator paid
no attention to ' the interruption
Towse laid his - hand on Lane's arm
and said something in a low , tone.
"I have the floor." the mayor shout-
pel as he flunerr off . the
interfering
hand, "and neither the Honorable Mr.
Towse nor anvone else can 'deprive
me of the privilege of free speech."
Tremendous applause greeted the
mayor's assertion ' of right, and he
went on to say that the bond issue
was the policy of a-tepubHcan mayor
j aucn great lmpvcutuvw iu mc uwi o
that it oiffht to be discussed before
so large a gathering of the Republican
party as the one he addressed.
Mayor "Lane-continued without fur
ther : Interruption except rounds of
applause as he took up Item after
item of the bond proposals and elo
quently advocated the approval of
each of them by the voters.
Towse came forward at' the con
clusion of Mayor Lane's speech and
said that he had Interrupted the lat
ter because - there had been 'an agree
ment with the committee before the
meeting 'that the bond issue "should
not be discussed.- .
.. H. T. Mills, who Is Tow3e's chief
supporter in fighting the bonds in Kai:
mukl, tried to start applause for his
leader, but his handclap was echoed
only by the moon, and th? moon was
ciouderd. Towae went back and. sat
down amidst a stillness that could be
felt ;
County Committeeman Henry
Freltas, after the incident, denied the
statement that the committee of the
local Republican club had made any
agreement to exclude discussion of the
bonds. In fact Mr. Freitas during the
week had invited different supervis
ors to -speak on the bonds If they
wished. "
