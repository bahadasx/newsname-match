lot when he "presents the certificate
and signs the affidavit, and after he'
has marked the ballot the election
officers are required to place it in
the envelope, seal it up, and forward j
it to the county auditor of the county |
in which the vote was cast. The j
county auditor of the county where j
the election is held shall then for-'
ward such sealed envelope to the i

ficers of the home precinct the cer
tificate, affidavit and envelope.

"HOW TO VOTE"

privileged to hear able discussions,
on subjects pertinent, to the general

ters' Alliance at its meeting Monday

tures" will be the subject discussed

Clark S. Thomas, of the Christian

"The Importance of County Offices."

WOOD AND COAL
FAMINE IMMINENT
Shortage of Cars Cause of Situation
Which May Prove Serious Se
veral Dealers Now Entirely
Out
Pullman is threatened with a
wood and coal famine that may as
sume serious proportions, the result
of the shortage of cars for transpor
tation purposes. Several dealers
were this week entirely out of one
or both of the necessary commodities
and there are no indications of im
mediate relief. Two local dealers
had a limited supply of coal this
week, but this was quickly gobbled
up by citizens who anticipated the
shortage and but little has been re
ceived since. The coal situation is
blamed entirely against the car
shortage, plenty of the fuel being
available at tho mines, but the lack
of transportation facilities makes
tho shipment to the dealers impos
sible. The short cordage of the past
year is to some degree responsible
for the wood shortage, the supply
being liimted at camps which have
heretofore shipped out large quanti
ties to the local dealers.
In Colton the situation is even
worse than here, and a number of
Colton farmers came to Pullman
Tuesday to lay In their winter's sup
ply, only to be met here by the
same condition, although not yet so
tense.
One local dealer has been entirely
out of coal since last Saturday and
has had no wood since Monday. He
has two carloads of wood now load
ing at Deary, which he expects Sat
urday, but has no Idea of how soon
he will be able to get coal. Another
dealer has three carloads of coal on
the way, and is considered highly
fortunate by his fellow dealers. Ac
cording to local dealers, the people
of Pullman may feel fortunate that
the shortage comes at this time as
there is not at the present time
enough fuel In Pullman to tide over
two days of cold weather.

FAMILY SQUABBLE;
j SON CHARGES FATHER
I
: A. L. Pagan Claims His Father, C.
M. Fagun, Assaulted Him With
Revolver—One Shot Fired
but No Damage Done
A family squabble of goodly pro
j portions at the C. M. Pagan resi
j dence on West Main street Sunday
I night resulted in the arrest of the
j father, C. M, Pagan, upon Informs
, tion filed by the son, A L. Pagan,
j in which the elder man was charged
!by th.' younger with assault with a
'deadly weapon with intent to kill.
I The father was arrested by Marshal
j Douglas but by Monday morning the
| son had experienced a Change of
heart and withdrew the complaint,
' the father being released from cus
' tody. Whiskey is thought to have
been responsible for the family
squabble, which might have resulted
disastrously. During the melee a re
volver was brought into play and the
I son alleged that, the father would
I have killed him had he not grasped j
| the weapon just as. it was dis
charged. Eye-witnesses were in-.
(lined to the belief that the son was
responsible for the altercation, and
I it was largely because of the lack of

Washington State and Her old Rival
! Will liiittle Before Old tirade
on Saturday
\
________
On Saturday, November 4, occurs
Washington State's second confer
ence football game of the season,
when Dietz's eleven will meet the
team from the University of Idaho
jon Rogers Field. Idaho has been
j three times defeated this season,
■ while Washington has broken even
with ono defeat at the hands of O.
A. C, and a victory over Ihe Uni
versity of Montana. Our old friend
j "Comparative Scores" concedes the
game to the Crimson and Gray by a
big score lev one method of figuring
I and by a slim margin by another.
lOoncsga beat Idaho i] to C; Mon
tana took Gonzaga into camp with a
I score of 20 to 0; and XX. S. C. Just
took care of Montana to the tune ot
27 to 0. Therefore, theoretically.
, Captain Bangs and his men should
win Saturday with a score of 62 to 6.
Approaching is from a "Doblo" or
SOUr-grape view-point, we can easily
sen that the above dope is off, for
O. A. C. beat Idaho 26 to 0 and won
from W. S. C. with a score of 13 to
10: deduction, with an even break
In luck we may win from Idaho by
about 23 points. If Diet/, and his
team were like Dobie and couldn't
exist without some dark cloud threat
ening their very existence, we would
cite the O. A. C. comparison as the
probable Correct dope. However, w*
find that we have a real red-blooded
as well as red-jerseyed eleven, and
consequently we point with pride to
the "score" via the Montana route,
FARMERS PROTEST
TELEPHONE SERVICE
j Claim !>> Made That Poor Service
Has Resulted in Substantial Loss
1.. Farmers on (•rain Sales
with a view to demanding im
proved telephone service from the In
land Co-operative company severs!)
farmers residing west of Pullman
. propose calling a meeting of farm
ers in the near future to take action
jin the matter. One farmer stated
this week that the alleged poor serv-
I Ice had resulted in a dead loss of
$600 to him on his wheat, sales, due
j to his Inability to get telephonic con
nection with the grain buyers when
! the prices were higher than the quo-
I tation on the day he sold. Other
farmers, he states, have had the.
same experience. The farmers state
that unless the. rural service is im
proved a concerted call will be sent
to the Bell company to again enter
the field.
The Inland company has enjoyed a
monopoly of the local telephone
business since they took over the
Bell business over a year ago.
GRAIN MARKET DEMORALIZED
The inadequate shipping facilities,
due to the shortage of cars, resulted
in the demoralization of the local
grain markets this week, oats being
the only cereal sought by the buyers
yesterday, and $1.60 being offered.
The Chicago market, after reaching
Its peak early this week, dropped on
Wednesday, but recovered partially
yesterday. But for the shipping con
ditions, which are said to be worse
than at any time during the last 10
years, red wheat would have brought
as high as $1.50 here early this
week. Nominal quotations on bar
ley yesterday were $1.80. and red
wheat, had there been a market,
would probably have brought better
than $1.40, with club and fortyfold
two and four cents higher, respect
ively.
TO PREVENT FLOOD
The chamber of commerce Tues
day named J. M. Reid to represent
that body before the city council in
an effort to have the channel of dry
creek cleaned to prevent the conges
tion of ice and consequent floods
next spring. The creek, which runs
down Grand street, overflowed its
banks last spring, due to Ice Jams,
and it Is thought that the cleaning of
the channel of si! debris at this time
will prevent a recurrence of the .
trouble.
