(lly Frank Graham )
A lea company' a!eman railed on
a lmjy In our fawn ono day luol H
and after Mil-; Infui n ed thai he had

grand offer, paying over her HO cent
and becoming the poeeor of the
prjml.iin In tolling me of tho im-l-

wmpany could make money on any
turn oaala.
A week later another aaleamnn
called and demanded another order
for tha aam company.
"But I have no order, declared tha
lady.
"Wall, how do you Intend to get oiaiing any mi a oi juauco, twenty n(l ,g luch ,ppreci.u jh, need of

In order to get the coupons to pay for
tha water set. She offered to pay for
the set in rash rlher than take any
mora of the roffea which sha did not
like and could not use, but th visitor
refused tha money.
Several other women told me tha
same story. Some laughed a though
it were a joke, other were angry- But
tha fact remain that all believe they
are compelled to buy tha full 132.00
worth of inferior good before being
assured of ownine- tha Dremium.
The unfair method put the local
grocers under a handicap. In none of

A big land deal was consummated
last Saturday by which Hoy Winn be
came the owner of Mcadowbrook farm
one mile and a half below Weston.
It contains 763 acres, and is among
th best improved ranches in Umuti'.la
county. The retiring owner, Joe
Hodgson, also sold to Mr. Winn 200
acre of summer fallow on the Ritchey
place at a value of $25 an acre, and
his entire ranching outfit, the total
consideration being $107,000. In fact,

realty operator,
Mr. Winn has leased his extensive
land holdings in the "Oregon hills" to
Glenn Scott, "and has sold his former
big outfit, which includes a caterpillar,
engine and a combined harvester, to
tha lessee. This will enable him to
devote his sole attention to his Dry
creek ranch . and to Meadow-brook
farm, upon which k ha already be-
gun operating. " ,
Weston regrets to loaa". "Jg-

hearts of its people, and his family

stood that he intends to remain in
Umatilla county, and that he is even
now negotiating for a larger ranch in
another district on which he can give
his exclusive attention to grain-raising.
