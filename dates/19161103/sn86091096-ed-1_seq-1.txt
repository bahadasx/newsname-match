E FIELD PEAS
IN THE PALOUSE
Good Results Are Obtained
Around Moscow.
An interesting article in the
Idaho Post of last week gave some
information in regard to the rais
ing of field peas that is worth con
sidering. Of course here in the
Potlatch country the bean crop
makes an ideal summer fallow crop
but the returns from the field peas
near Moscow have been so big this
season that there is no good reason
why the farmers of this section can
not take advantage of the idea and
at least plant a small field of
peas as an experiment.
Two of the Moscow merchants,
realizing the trouble they have had
in the years of summer fallowing,
trouble in collecting bills and notes,
took a trip last week to Fairfield,
Tekoa and Latah. They spent
several hours checking up on crop
conditions, inspecting warehouses
and talking with men in their
homes.
As a result of this trip they saw
more peas than the warehouses of
Moscow would hold, and they could
not buy a pound because all had
been contracted for months before
at 2 3-4 and 3 cents a pound.
They talked with intelligent
farmers, responsible men and found |
that none of the land was for sale
for less than $150 an acre. Then
they began to ask why. There
there is a better town, better rail
road facilities, better schools, bet- j
ter homes, and yet the land j
around Moscow—just as good land
and just as good soil — may be
bought for $75 and $85 an acre.
These men from Moscow were
told that they did not understand.
"Why, they were told by some of
the farmers with whom they talked,
, ,
"we can make the ^ price of land in j
one or two crops; then we can turn
the land over to the boys, go to
California and spend the winters,
live very well and come back each
year to look after the harvest and
collect our rent. If we sold we
would be disposing of all we have
and have no income at all after the
dollars we got for the land were
gone. In other words we could get
price of the land at the rate of $125
to $150 in two years in crops of
peas, beans, wheat, oats or potatoes
and have the land left."
This year E. J. Aimbruster raised
a crop of peas worth $99 an acre
gross on land that cost $75 an acre
a little more than a year ago.
Elmer D. Nichols raised a crop
worth $81 .an acre gross and George
O'Connor still has his crop but is
confident it will bring $7500 for the
120 acres.

After making as thorough a test
k
Jfi. conditions, the quality of the !
peas, the warehouse receipts, and
all other proofs to satisfy himself
of the facts, Mr. Williamson gave
out this statement:
"I wish to say to the Palouse
country; to every loyal farmer; to
every man who owns an acre of
ground; to every man who wishes
to better conditions for himself, his
wife and his children, that he is
satisfied, that Mr. Whittier and his
other assôciates are satisfied, after
a diligent investigation, up one
side and down the other; taking the
worst of it; considering the peas
worth but 2 cents a pound and hay
but $7 a ton, when as a matter of
fact the seed would be worth 5 to 6
cents a pound and hay $10 to $20
and after paying well for the sum
mer fallow, the field pea ccop will
not fall short of $16 an acre.

Rural Highways
The rural highways have not
been rougher or more, cut up for
many years than they were before
the showers of last week and the
condition of the highways this year
will result in many movements be
ing instituted for permanent, high
way improvements. It is explained
that the showers of last week
thoroughly wet down the dust that
has filled the highways for weeks
aa d a t many points had gained a
depth of nearly a foot. It was be
coming packed but the roads were
still rough when the showers set in
yesterday and those experienced in
the use of the road drags say the
conditions following the present
showers will be ideal for placing the
roads in perfect condition for fall
and winter travel.
The commissioners of the high
way districts and the road over
seers throughout the country will
be prepared to begin a systematic
dragging of the main highways as
soon as the showers are over and
the proper condition of the surface
prevails. It is stated the value of
dragging has been most convincing
ly demonstrated during the long
dry period as sections of the roads
where drags have been regularly
used, resisted the long dry period
and heavy traffic to such an extent
that at no time did they become
cut and rutted so as to interfere
with travel.
It is explained that the proper
use of the road drags provides a
surface that is practically water
proof and by continual use solidifies
to such an extent that it becomes
almost a pavement. The virtue of
the drag is that it moves the earth
toward the center of the highway
in thin layers and that a sufficiently
high crown is maintained to give
the roadway perfect drainage. The

! tions and with proper attention for
a period of two or three years,
some of the communities have
brought their highways into a con
dition where little attention will
now be needed to restore them to
good shape.—Tribune.

Editor Gazette—
After Trenton comes the city of
brotherly love—Philadelphia. This j
city is not well named. It is the:
§ame whiskey soaked place as is
found all along the line. The wor
ship of the mighty dollar is here,
as everywhere, the dominant idea.
Of course there is much that is
good, but as long as the saloons oc
cupy their present place in the civic
life of the city so long will the
present vice and degredation con
tinue.
The daily papers of Philadelphia
are strongly for Hughes so far as
numbers are concerned, but when
the quality of that support is ana
lyzed it shows much to be desired.
It is half hearted and consists in the
main of criticisms of President Wil
son rather than the exaltation of
candidate Hughes. The papers tac
itly admit it, and the private indi
vidual candidly gives expression to
the fact that Hughes has not met
expectations. Pennsylvania will go
for Hughes by a largely reduced
majority.
Wilmington was the next stop.
Here is the home of the DuPonts.
A magnificent hotel stands as a
monument to these powder manu
facturers, and it is a monument for
in our travels we have seen nothing
either larger or better. The local
claim is that there is nothing either
in New York or Philadelphia, or
elsewhere for that matter, that
equals it and we are not prepared
to dispute the claim. But with all
this great popularity of these gen
tlemen, express wagons were going
about the streets placarded in large
letters "Vote Against Henry Du
Pont for U. S. Senator." It seems
that the political machine of this
noted manafacturer is broken down
and he is in bad repute with the
laboring classes.
We had a* long conversation with
an extensive manufacturer who
said that they had more orders than
thev could fill if running full capa
city and yet 40 per cent of their
plant was idle owing to the lack of
labor. He was quite pessimistic
claiming that the DuPonts were
employing everybody and at wages
that defied competition on part of
manufacturers in either lines. He
said the average laborer tried to
get to work as late as possible, to
quit as early as possible and to do
as little as he could without for
feiting his job. He declared that
business men of the country over
were trying to find men that could
be trusted, men who make their |
employer's interests their own, but
with indifferent success,
j Baltimore is filled with the tough
es t looking "niggers" that we have
met and they also appear in the
greatest numbers. The negro is all
right—in his place. He amalga
mates with the white race rather
slowly and the daÿ seems a long
way off when he will have faded out.
Here we met several "Kentucky
Colonels." Thev were mighty nice
fellows—all of them. Politics in
Baltimore seems to be a secondary
matter. Wilson is strong and there
is little doubt as to the outcome.
But the prohibitions have been at
work. The town is placarded with
huge anti signs of whieh this is a
sample: "Vote against Prohibition
and keep Baltimore growing." As
vou come into the city and go out
similar signs are in evidence every
where. There could be found
nothing in favor of prohibition but
it was quite apparent that the Antis
were badly scared. If the slum el
ement, including most of the nig
gers, have a chance at the ballot
box, prohibition is hopeless.
Baltimore, while growing rapidly,
is slow. Much of tnis is doubtless
owing to her narrow streets. In
many streets the sidewalks are but
six feet wide. This compels pedes
trians to walk single file unless thev
wish to be jostled off the walk by a
nigger. We use the term "nigger"
without disrespect. In many of
our northern cities negroes are
found but in Baltimore all that we
saw belonged to the class designated
as "niggers." '
A short ride brings us to the city
beautiful—Washington. Here we
spent three days, a time long
enough to make a polite bow to a
very few of the innumerable attrac
tious. We received a slight im
pression of this wonderful city—

Winifred Calkins
Miss Winifred Calkins, Reptrbli
can nominee for superintendent of
schools in this county, has excep
tional qualifiications for the posi
tion. She has lived for practically
20 years in the county. She has
taught in the public schools of the
county for eight years, always with
marked success, and with a varied
experience in Deary, Kendrick and
Moscow. Her experience as
teacher has included the rural
schools, the town schools and the
high school also. Miss Calkins is a
graduate of the Moscow high school
and of the University of Idaho.
As a teacher she holds a state cer
tificate. In addition to her exper
ience as a teacher Miss Calkins has
had a valuable practical training
for the office she seeks by assisting
Miss Catherine T. Bryden, the pres
ent superintendent, at different
times in the past five years.—Post.
Kendrick Study Club
The regular meeting of the Kend
rick Study Club was held at the
home of Mrs. Shumaker November
After the business meeting
came the program consisting of a
paper "Resources and Industries of
Argentina" by Mrs. Oldfield, and
"Cities of Argentina" by Mrs/
Crocker. Following the program
delicious refreshments were served
by the hostess.
Ruth Broman
The voters of today no longer
vote for a candidate, especially for
a county office, because he is on a
certain ticket. They consider the
personal qualifications of the var
ious candidates. They also realize
that we can never have efficient
county officers if we turn them out
of office as quickly as they become
familiar with the work. Our pres
ent County Treasurer, Miss Ruth
W. Broman, has proven her ability
to handle the affairs of the office in
a competent and efficient manner.
{If you vote for her you know you
are voting for a good Treasurer,
for she has demonstrated her ability.
She will be no experiment. During
the time she has been in office she
has shown uniform C0U rtesy and
consideration in all business trans
j actions. Compare the expense of
running the office in Latah county
under Miss Broman's management
with that of other counties of equal
or less assessed valuation. You
will find that the office has cost the
taxpayers of Latah county less than
it has in other counties. Vote for
her—if you believe county offices
sbou ^d be run according to business
principles.

i others to keep for us.
