I um always glad to come to Hart

reived in a genuine spirit of old
Cushioned Kentucky hospitality. But
1 am jtlnd to be here today for anoth
er reason. As I look at this audi
snee, as 1 8co tho red pepper that has
been split by tho Republican party,
al look Into tho eyes of tho leaders
and workers in the old Republican
party, 1 know that when election
day comes'urouud old Ohio county
is going to roll up the bjistiugest ma
jority over known for Hughes and
Fairbanks. And my purposo In com
ing here today, my friends, is as an
American to talk to my follow Am

liic.s, and what is best to bo done
for tho wollfnro of tho whole people,
and to talk to you about tho honor
of tho American Flag. - Hut 1 am not

I w nl to talk about auothor phase

in the foot nnd the second took effect
In Curtis' bowels, ranging upward.
It Ik alleged that the latter was arm

After tho shooting Curtis walked
across the street nnd sat down. It
was soon discovered that ho was bad
ly wounded and he was taken to the
homo of his father-in-law where a
doctor was summoned, but the

CIXCIXXATI ATTORNEY SAYS HE
ASSURED 1UM PAY
MENT. Frankfort, Ky., Oct. 30. A bill
for $208,000, for ink ordered for the
county and city schools of Kentucky
for 1914 and 1915, has been present
ed to State Superintendent Gilbert by
a Cincinnati firm. Tho ink was or
dered by Harksdalo Hamiett. The
collector was notified that the State
does not buy Ink for county and city
schools.
Cincinnati, , O., Nov. 1. Investi
gation of tho books of the Woodman
see Ink Company, 117 East Pearl
street, to determine if a mlssing-ex-.
ecutlve officer fostered any other ir
regularities than to accept orders,
alleged to be false, purporting to bo
from Darksdale Hamiett while Mr.
Hamiett was Superintendent of Pub
lic Instruction of Kentucky, wa3 be
gun yesterday by Samuel C. Church,
an attorney, representing his slster-ln-law,
Mrs. Salllo Woodmansee.
Mrs. Woodmansee is proprietor of
tho company. It is believed an ex
ecutive olBcor, who is reported to
havo fled with a woman other than
his wife, accepted spurious orders ag
gregating $219,000 for ink and paste
which never wero delivered to Ken
tucky educational headquarters.
Search through billing flies to de
termine to whom the Ink finally was
billed, also was begun yesterday by
Mr. Church, who reaffirmed his
statemont Monday that Mr. Hamiett
had assured him in person his bill
would be paid if presented to V. O.
Gilbert, present Superintendent of
Public Instruction tu Kentucky. Mr.
Hamlbtt has denied any knowledge
of tho alleged orders.
"I met Mr. Hamiett twlco lu Cin
cinnati, each time In conference with
tho Woodmanseo representative who
has disappeared," said Mr. Church
yesterday. "Approximately three
weeks ago Mr. Hamiett said ho would
do all In his power to soo that col-
ectlons woremado on tho bills, which
have boon duo slnco lato In Novem
ber, 1915."
When Mr. Church proeontod his
blll3 to Kontuoky offlcials at Frank

Mr. Church aald ho has boen una
