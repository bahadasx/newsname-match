The football contest between the

game and that being to the heavy
Hibbing team Hibbing in turn held
the Virginia team to a 0 to 0 score,
the Virginia team not having lost
a game for three seasons
The Bemidji eleven will be weak
ened considerably by the loss of
Plummer and Frank Phibbs These
two men have been permitted to play
in former contests, but on account
of a protest will not be allowed to
take part in Saturday's contest
Saturday's contest will find Capt
Bailey playing his last game with the
local eleven The other players who
will be lost to the team this season
are Warfleld, White, Palmer, Gainey
and Phibbs There Is no doubt but
that in the coming contest all these
men will put up the hardest game
of their football career at Bemidji
Local football fans will have an op
portunity of seeing some high class
football in the coming contest Not
only every alumnus but every local
football enthusiast should make it
a point to do their part toward win
ning tomorrow's game
A good crowd is expected as con
siderable enthusiasm is being shown
over the coming battle

LEAGUE GIVES
SEASON FOB ACTION
Enthusiastic Meeting it Held by the
League at the Methodist
Church.
At a representative and enthusias
tic meeting of the Civie League in
the auditorium of ihe Methodist
church last night, the candidacy of
Charles S. Carter for representative to
the state legislature from the 62nd
district was unanimously endorsed.
"Mr. Carter's fearless and open
method of campaigning his position
upon the ditch question and all other
questions looking to the best inter
ests of Beltrami county, his knowl
edge of state-wide interests his stand
upon all moral issues, together with
his successful busines career and
uprightness of character over against
his opponent's trimming method of
campaigning, his failure to declare
himself openly upon the important
issues before the people, his failure
to accomplish anything in the last
legislature, although he claims to
have gotten an appropriation for a
state normal school in Bemidji
which, however, is not sustained by
the journal of the house of represen
tatives, his failure to stand at any
time for progressive temperance leg
islation and other moral legislation,
together with his own statement that
he seeks not the office because he
was urged to do so, but because he
wanted the job, is reason for the ac
tion of the league," said Rev. B. D.
Hanscom, president of the league,
this morning.

Compares It to the Free Sliver Slogan
of 1896 in Address at
Kerkhoven.
WHO KEPT OTHER
COUNTRIES FROM WAR
Talks in Questions Asks Why Amer
ican Soldiers are How on the
Border.
(By United Press)
Kerkhoven, Minn., Nov. 8."Wil-
son kept us out of war," the Demo
cratic slogan of today is about as
much of a sham and farce as their
free silver slogan of 1896, Thomas
Frankson, Republican candidate for
lieutenant governor, told a Republi
can mass meeting here this after
noon. Frankson talked In questions,
which included:
"Why did the Democratic party
during the present administration
create over 4,000 new offices and add
over 17,000 employes to the Federal
payrolls?
"Why was the last Democratic con
gress the most extravagant by over
one billion dollars that has ever as
sembled in Washington?
"Why are 75 per cent of the presi
dent's appointments and 75 per cent
of all the important congressional
legislation committees dominated and
controlled by the Southern states,
when they contribute 25 per cent of
the government revenues?
$20 a Person.
"Why did the last Democratic ad
ministration saddle an indebtedness
of 120 upon every man, woman and
child in the United States?
"Why don't England stop seizing
our first class and parcel post mails?
"Why don't Wilson stop England
from seizing cargo after cargo of non
contraband goods?
"What is the legal definition of a
Wilson or Democratic ultimatum?
"Why didn't Mexico salute our Am
erican flag?
"How about Wilson sending our
Atlantic fleet to Vera Cruz, Mexico,
to stop the landing of arms in Mex
ico, and to protect our American cit
izens, our navy returning after a
loss of nineteen men and many men
wounded, and did not prevent the
landig of arms in Mexico and our
American citizens in Mexico were
abandoned and had to seek shelter
underneath the folds of the German
flag?
"How about the notorious Adam
son law, whether it is truly an eight
hour day law, or a law legalizing ten
hours* pay for eight hours" pay only
to the best paid men in the railroad
service today'
How Abont Revenue?
"Why don't the present Underwood
tariff law produce sufficient revenue?
"Why did they pass the very un
popular stamp act, which the Demo
crats termed as a war tax, two years
ago'
"Why are the farmers and manu
facturers of Norway, Sweden, Den
mark end Holland getting fabulous
war prices for all the commodities
they have to sell?
"Why are 140,000 American sol
diers now entrenched on foreign ter
ritory and on the Mexican border and
more lives lost and sacrificed than
during the entire Spanish-American
war?
"Who kept Norway, Sweden, Den
mark and Holland out of the war?
"And their only answer is, He
kept us out of war!' Frankson con
cluded. SIX ARRESTED ON
