said in his Schneeludy speech. "But

of four years and under our institu

promising seemingly Immaterliil
I changes," when called Inlo contuiltn
Ition concerning the affairs of tho
! country, w hich would eventually lead
to the defeat of the main objocts ot
I the legislation proposed."
i "Do you wonder," said the presl
jdent, "that I do not call them Into
I consultation, and yet I tell you again
'that they will welcome the moment
! they come (o co-operate, and they will
j not be welcome until then."
I The president assured his nudlenco

Continuous Ovation.
From the time of his arrival tiers
from Buffalo, this morning, the pr u

ovation. Largo erowdH, includina
many railroad employes, cheered him

at the Grand Central terminal. Ac
companied by Mrs. Wilson and tha
other members of hlit thirty, the pres

yacht Muyf iwer, anchored off the

Serious Periods of lllMtory.
' "We urn living In a. very serious
j period of tho world's history and,
therefore, It seems to mo especially
. encumbent upon us that wo should,
so far as possible, "search every ques
itiou to the heart. And when I think:
of searching the business question to
l the heart, It seems to me that thero
I are some very largo reckonings which
j have too often been left out of tlio
I account. When you think of the ultl
jmale foundations of business you must
iknovv that you find them in Ihe con
ditions of national life, and that tho
particular conditions upon which suc
cesful Vital business depends are tho
icondilions which touch the dally Bf
of the common mass of people of tho
eon ill ry.
