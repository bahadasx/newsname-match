VOLUME SIXTY-NINE
SETTLE DISPUTE
.Question of Immunity for
Defensively Armed Ships
Will Be Discussed
(NO AGREEMENT ON
THAT MATTER NOW
Washington, D. C., Nov. 2.—State
department officials still were waiting
today for Germany's version of the de
struction of the British steamer Mar
ina with loss of American lives. They
also were expecting affidavits and oth
er data gathered from American sur
vivors.
A news dispatch from Athens last
night r.aying the Greek government
had been notified Germany intended to
'•ink without warning all ships carry
ing supplies to the allies, was regarded
here as of great importance. So far as
Is known the United States has re
ceived no such notification and it is
not known whether one has been sent
to other neutrals.
Such a procedure would be regarded
by the United States as directly con
trary to Germany's pledges.
No Distinction Made.
Secretary Lansing said today that
the United States understands Ger
many's pledges not tol sink merchant
men without warning and without pro
Tiding for the safety of passengers and
crews applies to ships with defensive
armament. No distinction was drawn
In the correspondence between armed
and unarmed ships and the state de
partment does not accept any conten
tion that Germany's report by this
Is limited to those without armament.
Nevertheless it is admitted that Ger
many has always taken a distinct
•lew of the status of armed ships and
It is thought probable that she will
attempt to inject the point into the
present situation. So long as the poli
cies of the two governments are so
utterly divergent it is thought possible
that Germany might use the Marina
case to 6ettle the issue. Her increased
submarine warfare combined with the.
Increasing fititober of armed allied
ships and their Increasing efficiency In
.defense, makes it a vital question to
fher.
Secretary Lansing, while refusing to
(give out any further details of the of
ficial report of the sinkings from the
I American embassy in London, said his
[information was substantially the
tsame as that of the newspapers.
Germany and Austria on February
flO In substantially the same terms no
tified the United States to the follow
llng effect:
Teutons Gave Warning.
"Enemy merchantmen armed with
[guns no longer have the right to be
considered as peaceable merchant ves
sels of commerce. Therefore the Ger
man naval forces will receive orders
to treat such vessels as belligerents."
However, in accepting the American
note on the Sussex, demanding the
abandonment of its submarine warfare
against "passenger and freight carry
ing vessels," Germany said such ves
sels should not be sunk without warn
ing and without providing for the safe
ty of passengers and crew "unless the
lehips attempt to escape or offer resist
ance." No condition was made as to
armed ships.
SIX AMERICANS DEAD.
London. Nov. 2. —A telegram to the
American embassy today from Wesley
Frost, American consul at Queenstown
retates that the discrepancies in for
mer reports regarding the number of
[Americans on board the British steam
ship Marina and the names of those
lost have now been cleared up.
In addition to the five Americans re
ported yesterday as having been lost,
jthe name of Buie, given in earlier ad
[•ices as Brue, is added to the list of
'dead.
The name of Middletown first re
ported lost, is now in the list of Amer
ican survivors. These changes make
the total number of Americans on
board fifty-two. of whom-six were lost.
PRIVATEBANKER

Chicago, Nov. 2. —Steven Zagar, 23
years old, member of the private bank

French a year ago, escaped and came
to Chicago where he obtained employ

GOSSIP CAUSE OF
SERIOUS CHARGES
MISSOURI MAN, ACCU8ED OF MUR
DERING WIFE, TELLS HIS
SIDE OF AFFAIR.
St. Joseph, Mo., Nov. 2. —Gossip
which started as an undercurrent but
which gathered force with each repe
tition until "every angel held an ac
cusing finger," was blamed for his mis
fortunes by Oscar D. McDanlel, prose
cuting attorney of Buchanan county, in
an address here last night in the inter
est of his candidacy for reelection, in
which he discussed the murder of his
wife last July and his subsequent ar
rest. It was his first public presenta
tion of his side of the case.
An audience, which overflowed a
local theater, interrupted him fre
quently with applause and words of
encouragement, or wept, silently with
him.
"Idle tales grew In Intensity until my
best friends believed them," McDanie!
asserted. "People lost their reason.
Detectives then appeared and my
every act and word was distorted to
suit their aspect of the case."
The prosecutor recounted the tales
which he said had been circulated
about him. Among them, he said, was
the allegation that Mrs. McDanlel's
diamonds had been found by detec
tives sewed up In his coat and another
that Mrs. McDanlel. delirious in a hos
pital before she succumbed to her In
juries, had cried:
"Oh! Oscar don't hit me again."
These stories were branded as un
true. He said they started with a
malicious misconception of the truth.
McDaniel's trial will not be resumed
until after the election November 7.
U-BOAT JNSPECTED
Committee From New London Cham
ber of Commerce Permitted to
Visit Deutschland.
New London, Conn., Nov. 2.— Bags
of mail brought across the seas by the
German undersea merchantman, the
Deutschland, which arrived yesterday,
were brought ashore today. During
the forenoon little work was done up
on the cargo. Shortly before noon
Mayor E. E. Rogers, President M. T.
Miner of the chamber of commerce
and about fifty members constituting
a committee waited upon Captain
Koenig. The captain accepted an in
vitation to a dinner to be given by the
chamber. The party was then divided
Into groups of five apd eaoh went pn
the submarine and looked it ©*er.
Captain T. A. Scott of the Scott
Wrecking company sent a diver down
alongside of the Deutschland and he
reported there were fourteen small
holes in the anchor bulkhead. These
were probably made when the anchor
dented the shell of the craft The
holes had caused some leakage on the
trip over.
The announcement of the Deutsch
land's manifest was awaited with some
curiosity. Captain Koenig estimating
the cargo to total $10,000,000 in value,
said it consisted largely of drugs and
dye stuffs but said there were possibly
securities and Jewels among the con
signments. As the Deutschland* on
her trip to Baltimore carried only $1
600,000 worth of freight which bulked
as large as her present shipments, it
was considered probable that most of
the $10,000,00 valuation was repre
sented by securities or stones.
GERMANS CAUTIOUS.

German Ocean Navigation company of
Bremen has up to now been unable to

arrival, they are inclined to question
their authenticity. Their readers are

trader, relieves them of all doubt.
An erroneous story of the arrival of
the commercial Bremen at an Ameri

OFFICIALS SAY
STORY IS FALSE
Mayor and Commissioners
Brand Potato Yarn as
Wholly Unfounded
A statement has been issued by May
or Carter and Commissioners Ehr
mann and.Berry denouncing the story
in circulation about the streets regard
ing the alleged stopping of the sale
of potatoes from a car in the local
yards to people of the city.
The story is branded as false in its
entirety and wholly without founda
tion. The officials in the statement
which bears their signatures, explain
all that they had to do with the potato
selling incident, showing that a license
was issued the salesman and stating
that another will be issued if request
ed. The statement follows:
The city council vs. a lot of infa
mous lies about a carload of potatoes.
To the people of Ottumwa, Iowa:
Statements are being circulated
throughout the city regarding the attl-
Where and from whom these stories
originated, we do not know, nor wheth
er they are the result of a misunder
standing or a deliberate attempt to de
fame the city council, but we want to
go on record now as stating that there
1st absolutely not one word of truth la
any of these Infamous stories.
Here are the facts:
Possibly two weeks ago, Mr. Brown
called up the city clerk's office and
asked about the ordinance that re
quired peddlers to pay a license, and
asked if it compelled a person who
took orders first and made delivery
afterward to pay a license. He was
informed that it did not. The next we
heard of the matter was last Saturday
morning when someone- called the
clerk's office and Informed the clerk
that someone was selling potatoes
from a car near the C. B. & Q. depot
and asking If A license had been taken
out. He was Informed that a license
had not been issued and that the mat
ter would be looked into. Mr. Ehr
mann and Mr. Berry were in the
clerk's office at the time and the mat
ter was referred to them. The mayor
was not present at the time and did
not knew of the report until he heard
of it on the street. In less than one
half hour after we were informed and
before either Commissioners Berry or
Ehrmann had left the clerk's office,
Mr.,Brown telephoned and asked if he
would be expected to pay a license If
he peddled the potatoes from the car
without having previously taken or
ders for them. The ordinance was
read to him and he remarked that it
evidently applied to him in this case
and to make him out a license for one
day and he would send a check to pay
for same. The license was issued, the
check came and we thought the inci
dent was closed until these persistent,
pernicious, false stories were put into
circulation by someone. If they orig
inated from a misunderstanding of the
case we want to say that insofar as
they apply to the city council trying
to prefent Mr. Brown from disposing
of his potaoes, they are wrong: but if.
as we have reason to believe, they
started from a desire to cause trouble
to the mayor and commissioners, they
are the rankest kind of deliberate, un
qualified falsehoods. There was no ef
fort made by the mayor and commis
sioners or any other person connected
with the city government to interfere
In any way with Mr. Brown's business.
Furthermore, all the license that was
paid by Mr. Brown was paid without
solicitation by anyone with authority
to do so and without trouble of any
kind, for as soon as Mr. Brown knew
what the ordinance required he did
like all good citizens should do, com
plied without a kick of any kind.
Further, the mayor and commission
ers are willing to go on record now
by saying that if anyone will agree to
bring potatoes or any other commodity
that can be and will be sold to the
consumer at a price that will material
ly reduce the cost to the poor people of
the cltv. they will give them all the
assistance they can. even to the paying
o. the license required by the city or
dinance out of their own pockets if
necessary.
