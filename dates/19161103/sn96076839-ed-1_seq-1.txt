The Election
Next Tuesday
Many Important Questions To
Be Decided.
Next Tuesday, Nov. 7th, is the day
wheirevery elector in Charlevoix Coun
ty should go to the polls, secure the
five ballot which he will be given,
carefully mark his decisions thereon,
and cast them in the ballet box.
of the five ballots to be cast, the
regular official ballot will be found
quite large. It is 151,,' x 22 inches, and
contains the Republican, Democratic,
National Progressive, Socialist, Prohibi
tion and Socialist Labor tickets in above
order. The National Progressive party
ticket will be found peculiar in that no
candidates whatever have decided to
aiiow their names placed in that column
and the cntirw ticket is a blank. In
some of the counties in the state this
ticket wiil not appear on the ballot and
it is an open questionwhether or not it
should be given a place.
'Ihe Republican Ticket is the only
one on the ballot that contains a full
compleinei.t ot candidates. Elsewhere
in this issue will be found a list of the
Republican candidates with the excep
tion of the names of the fifteen electors
ofpre.skknt and vice president.
Four amendment ballots will be hand
ed the voters and on these will be the
largest percentage of errors made.
Conservatively estimating, at least ten
per cent of the voters will mark their
bdlcU contrary to their real desires,
and t jo much care cannot be exercised,
(let samples of these before securing
your ballots and go over them care
fully. If you're "SURE" you're right
then the chances are all the more that
you will mark your ballot wrong
paradoxical as this may seem.
Next Tuesday don't forget. Five
ballots-and UK -SURE YOU MARK
THEM RIGHT.
THE KNOCKER
livery community has him every
community cusses him, and every com
munity tolerates him.
He is usually an unsuccessful busi
ness man whose objectionable ways
have been the direct cause of his losing
in the game of life. He must needs
vent his spleen on some one or some
thing. Admitting no fault jn himself,
ergo, the fault must be in his environ
ment hence he knocks.
He is a pestiferous cuss, and as little
as we may believe it, he really does
harm.
He is sure to get the ear of many
new men in town and pours int-) their
ears his abuse of the place. rding

business men are cheats andsw" lers.
1 lie professional men are quackl and
shysters. To his way of thinking there
isn't a decent mechanic in the place.
Len the laborers are lazy and trifling.
The town is dead and is no place for a
live man to tarry. His soured soul
fanly writhes and squirms with sar
donic joy when he sees that his mias
matic mouthings are. having their in
tended effect upon the victim. That is
the knocker that is his story, his way.
If there is a public enterprise planned
that needs co-operation and united
eitort he is immediately possessed of a
superior wisdom and begins with glee
to point out all of the weak spots. No
calculations can by any possibility work
out as intended. Men upon whom the
entei prise depends will prove weak or
traitors. The plans are all wrong. The
whole thing is a piece of stupendous
folly, and he for one will have nothing
to do with it.
Rut what a pity he will not! That
would be all the community would ask
of him and his mouth.
And thus it goes on year after year.
Doe's it have any effect, you ask? It
certainly does. The business life of a
community, contrary to the opinions of
many, is susreotible to influence from
Adverse critics. Perhaps not half of
his hearers know the real cause of his
pe?siniistic knockings, and in many
rmnds a doubt lingers and things that
should g j with a rush are unaccount
ably slow and lagging.

Si nock tell him plainly that there are
quite a number of roads leading away
from the town, and cordially invite him
to take one of them and follow it to its
end.
And let every loyal citizen of the
town give him the same advice.
TEMPERANCE MEETING
TONIGHT
AT THE ARMORY
A Temperance Mass Meeting will be
held at the Armory this Friday night,
Nov. 3rd, to further the interest of the
"dry" cause.
Dr. A. C. Bane of Columbus, Ohio,
one of the strongest speakers on the
platform today in the great cause of
temperance, will deliver the address.
The meeting commences at eight
o'clock and everybody is cordially in
vited to attend and hear this able
orator.
LATE INFORMATION
ON THE BEAN SITUATION
Fast Lansing, October 20. The
markets department of the Michigan
Agricultural College is answering many
of the inquiries coming to it from
people interested in the bean situation
by pointing to the official crop report
figures. These show that the October
estimate of the 1916 crop of white pea
beaus for Michigan is U,7d0,000 bushels
as against the final estimate of the 1915
crop of 4,2o0,000. This is a decrease of
over half a million bushels. The of
ficial figures for the five leading bean
producing states are 9,924,000 bushels
for 191G as against 10,278,000 for 1915.
The Director of Markets has called
attention to the fact that the claims
made by some buyers that the present
Michigan crop will approximate five
million bushels is a gross exaggeration.
He also is of the opinion that state
ments that because of submarine activ
ity it will be difficult to export beans
are misleading. Belgium exports to
Centtal and South American ports will
be unaffected by war conditions, ac
cording to the director.
A wire report from California under
date of October 10 said that the rains
which hare been interfering with the
harvesting of the California crop have
started again, and that the former esti
mate of a ten per cent damage would
have to be revised to a larger figure.
A previous report had stated that the
greater part of the California crop whs
in the field, except the limasand black
eyes. The report further stated that
from three to four weeks of good
weather was needed for the harvest.
The Director of Markets believes
that it is very significant that the bean
buyers at Owosso are buying from the
farmers on the basis of $5 a bushel.
JAMES N. McBRIDE,
Mich. Director of Markets.
SELECTING CORN
FOR SHOW PURPOSES
For the benefit of those who are
planning to enter corn in the big eorn
oontest at Ironton Orange Hall, Nov.
17th, we give the following rules for
selecting pood ears tor exhibition or
contest purposes:
1. Start picking out the best tars of
com as fastas it is husked. Dry this
corn thoroughly by any of the common
methods. In the process of drying, the
I kernels dry first and become loose on
I the cob. In mature corn, however, the
i kernels will again be pulled tightly to
I gether by the shrinking of the cob as it
I dries.
I 2. Decide on one ear which you
think possesses the proper size, shape,
color, and other characteristics of the
variety. Then match this type ear as
closely as possible with nine others for
your entry. Lack of uniformity in any
respect should be avoided.
3. Select ears on which the rows are
nearly straight and unbroken from butt
to tip.
4. Try to find ears with well cover
ed butts and tips.

5. Avoid immature ears. Immaturity
Is shown by dull color and loose ker
nels. Small, well matured ears are
better for contest purposes than larger
but immature ears.
C. Avoid ears which show such de
fects as odd kernels, lost kernels,
diseased kernels, irregular rows,-flat
tened tips, bulging butts, or conspicu
ous signs of mixture.
Perfect ears will not be found. When
your corn is well dried select those
ears which most nearly approximate
perfection. In all cases it is desired
that the contestant give the variety
name and the dates of planting and
cutting.
In the potato contest, pick out only
tubers of marketable fcize, uniform in
;e and sV.ape, true to type, and free
from disease or mechanical injuries.
One-half bushel entries are desired.
Watch for premium list in nxt issue.
II. L. HARNUM,
Chairman of Contest Comm.
To the Voters of Charlevoix Co.
I am a candidate for the office of
Sheriff at the corning election on the
Democratic Ticket, and having resided
in the County for the past thirty-five
years, and having held various public
offices, am sure that I am qualified for
the position. 1 shall vote for State
Wide 1'rohibition, and against Home
Rule, so called, and if elected will see
that all the laws are enforced to the
best of my ability, and to keep ex
penses down. As party lines cut no
figure in County matters I trust I may
have tho support or all right thinking
people.

THROWING MUD
AT SLEEPER
(Charlotte Tribune, Oct. 25.)
In Mr. Sleeper, the republicans of
Michigan have an excellent candidate
for governor. He is a methodical busi
ness man, who has builded success up
on thrift, hard work and attention to
details and the primitive standards of
honesty. Mr. Sleeper's record as state
treasurer has been a splendid one and
makes him a very satisfactory sort of a
person to have in charge of the state's
administrative affairs. He is a man
with needful experience, capacity and
determination.
The democrats are trying very hard,
though unsuccessfully, to make some
of their mud stick to him, by trying to
make out that he is a "wet." This, to
anyone who. knows Mr. Sleeper, liis
personal habits and his record, is ridic
ulous. Grant Hudson, superintendent
of the Anti-Saloon league, stated in the
Methodish church in this city recently,
when here to make an address, that
Mr. Sleeper was the heaviest contribu
tor, in pmount $500, during the last
local option fight in his county, and
that before he had any gubernatorial
ambitions. He endorsed Mr. Sleeper
in the highest terms. The Anti-Saloon
league in a public statement issued
Friday said: "Either Mr. Sleeper or
Mr. Sweet for governor will be accept
able as far as the Anti-Saloon league is
concerned. Both Sleeper and Sweet
are known to us as being dry men and
we will get a square deal if either is
elected. Either candidate will be ac
ceptable to us.M

Legislature
Has Final Vote
To Act if Both Wet and Dry
Propositions Carry.
Lansing, Nov. 1 .While it has been
generally supposed that the adoption
of the statewide prohibition amend
ment and the adoption of the so-called
home rule amendment wouJd result in
endless legal tangles and would throw
the question into the courts for adjudi
catifin the success of prohibition will
rest entirely with the next legislature
and there w ill be nothing for the courts
to interpret until the question has been
formally passed upon by the lawmak
ing body of Michigan.
This in substance is the opinion of
one of the best constitutional lawyers
in the state who for obvious reasons
does not want to be quoted in the
matter.
Owing to the confusion in the minds
of the voters there seems to be a pre
vailing opinion that both amendments
w'll carry. However, neither can be
come effective until the necessary legal
machinery is provided by the legis
lature. The amendments declare that
the legislature must provide the neces
sary machinery for putting them into
effect if they are adopted.
However, there is no power on eflrth
except public opinion that can compel
a legislature to do anything against its
will. The lawmaking body is supreme
and a law uuto itself. If the drys con
trol the house and can hold a majority
in the senate there is nothing to pre
vent them from passing legislation to
put prohibition into effect and disre
garding the township unit amendment
entirely in case both propositions re
ceive a majority vote at the election
next week.

SIXTH STANDARD SCHOOL
IN CHARLEVOIX COUNTY
On the evening of Thursday, the 26th
of October, the patrons of Phelps,
Marion No. C, gathered to celebrate the
turning point in the history of their
school. They have met all of the re
quirements of the state inspection of
last spring except the planting of a few
trees to beautify the school yard. The
state superintendent granted that the
tree planting might be done in the
spring and the plate granted this fall.
Sometimes there is not a great deal
to do to get a school iir shape and yet it
is a great step from a poor school or a
mediocre school to a truly good school.
It is a breaking away from old habits
and taking a step in the right direction.
For this reason the school director, Mr.
Harmon Ilimebauch and his assistant
officers, Mr. Richard O'Neil and Mr.
Balch are to be congratulated in having
their school on record at the capitol.
The teacher, Miss LaConnt taught
last year in a Standard School in
Chandler township and fully realized
the advantages whkh her pupils would
receive from the movement which the
district fathers had taken. She had
therefore prepared a fitting program
for the event with recitation, pantomine
and song.
Supt. Craig of Charlevoix was kind
enough to throw all other work aside
and hie himself to Phelps over the
rough and muddy roads to participate
yi the event and deliver the address of
the evening.
Delicious refreshments were served;
sandwiches, cake, wafers and coffee.
Of course it tasted good and everybody
felt good so you may rest assured that
everybody there had a good time.
Because good boys and girls are far
better than good school buildings, this
school building was dedicated like the
other Standard Schools to truth and
health, symbolic of right. When the
plate was presented to the district in
behalf of the State Superintendent of
Public Instruction the boys and girls
yelled loudly and well,
"We're a Standard School all right,
Hear us yell with all our might.
Blue and white! Blue and white!
Rah! Rah! Right!!!!"
School Commissioner's
Notes
Miy L. Stewart, Commissioner
First round of visits completed in
Marion township Monday and Tuesday.
Marion Center, which is Marion No.
9, has all new steel-framed adjustable
seats. This district and Horton Bay
have the best seating conditions in the
county, city schools not excepted.
Marion township teacher's meeting
was held at Marion Center, Tuesday
afternoon. Every teacher was present
and a lively meeting ensued. It was
an inspiration to the less fortunate
teachers to look at the new seats and
see what can be done by progressive
district fathers.
Hurrah for Phelps, the sixth Stand
ard school in Charlevoix County! The
first Standard School in Marion twp!
Say! you ought to have been there to
hear those children shout for joyl
Schools in Clarion ordered closed be
cause of two diphtheria cases in town.
East Chandler school has been care
fully fumigated and opens Monday,
Oct. 30th.
Boyne Falls schools have had the
quarantine lifted. Let us hope this is
the end of misfortune to our schools
and to our boys and girls.
Hart Lake social for Hollowe'en Fri
day the 27th, well attended. A good
time reported by all. The Com'r was
glad she was there.
The second visit made to Boyne
Valley No. 6.
The Com'r has postponed her trip to
Grand Rapids three days but will at
tend the general discussions at the
Commissioner's and Superintendent's
meetings during the last of the week.
No notes therefore, next week.
Nothing pleases a fat woman more

I could not stand up more than half the
time. Foley Kidney Pills took all of
