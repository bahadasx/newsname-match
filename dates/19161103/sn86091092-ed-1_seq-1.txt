BMi GAME
In a game that probably was the
hardest fought contest of the season,
Caldwell succeeded in only tying
Baker City. The Oregonians out
weighed the Caldwell boys almost to a
man, but in spite of this they were un
able to force the Idahoans line. Cald
well received in the kick off and im
mediately set about a series of line
plunges to force their way through to
the Oregonians' goal. Although they
were outplayed in a very decisive style
the Baker boys succeeded in grabbing
a forward pass and got away with a
touch down. The goal was kicked.
Not until the second half was the
Baker team able to make their yardage
through the Caldwell team, and then
only for two or three times.
Baker Fails on Chance to Score.
Getting awav with a pretty forward
pass for 12 yards it seemed for a
few moments that they had an ex
cellent opportunity to score again, but
Houghton's men tightened and in an
other attempt to pass they lost an op
portunity for securing a touch down.
Full back Cook using his toe con
stantly with most excellent results,
Caldwell ends got down under the
punts in a style that was amazing.
The Oregon lads were unable to reurn
the ball even a reasonable distance.
On nearly every punt they received,
the player was downed in his tracks
by the Caldwell ends.
Caldwell Scores.
At the .opening of the second half
Cook went through the line for a
pretty gain. Then Conners was put
through and succeeded in getting away
after having found Baker's line want
ing, for a nice 55 yard run for a touch
down, downing the ball at the corner
of the gridiron. On the kick out the
Baker team failed to line up 5 yards
back of the goal line and as a result
they were able to intercept the ball
just as one of the Caldwell players
was receiving it, but the referee de
clared the Oregonians off side and an
other kick out was allowed. The ball
was received on the 35 yard line and
from this point Cook gooted the pig
skin for another point—the score 7 to7.
For the remainder of the game Baker
was kept entirely on the defensive.
Twice Caldwell got within striking
distance, but was unable to connect
with the play that would carry the oval
over for another touch down. The
last quarter Cook made a beautiful at
tempt at a field goal from the 10 yard
line, but missed the mark by a few
inches.
Baker Outplayed From Every Angle.
The Eaker team was well balanced
for weight and size. The men were
fast and apparently in good trim, but
somehow they lacked the punch. In
spite of the superior weight they were
unable to make consistent gains of any
sort against the Caldwell squad. They
were out passed in the open plays by
the Caldwell eleven, as well as out
distanced in the plays around the ends.
Cook and Cowers gained consistently
through their line, and never once dur
ing the game did the Baker eleven ac
tually get away from the defensive
game. They tightened considerably
during the last quarter, but at no time
did they demonstrate a prowess over
the Caldwell eleven in playing the
game.
Second Team Defeats Nampa.
The second team journeyed to Nam
pa on Monday evening, where they en
gaged in a scrimmage with the sec
ond team of that city. The Caldwell
lads out-classed their opponents in
every stage of the game.| They de
feated the Nampaites by a score of 20
to 0. It is expected that the Nampa
boys will return the gaine later on in
the season.
Boise Game Saturday.
A large and enthuiastic crowd is ex
pected to attend the Boise game which
will take place at 3 o'clock on Satur
day afternoon, November 4th. This
game is always the most interesting
one of the season and it is expected
the Caldwell fans will be out in force
to enjoy the game, by which Caldwell
hopes to claim the championship of
Idaho. Although the Caldwell team is
not in the very best condition since the
Baker game, they expect to make
themselves proficient in every style of
attack known to them for the game.
Boise School Masters' Club Here
November 4th.
The next meeting of the Boise Val
ley School Masters' club will meet at
Caldwell high school on Saturday
evening. November 4th. The organi
sation came into existence a month
ago at Roise. They will enjoy a din
ner served by the domestic science de
partment of the high school, after
which they will participate in discus
sions along educational lines. A large
attendance is expected.
Junior« and Seniors Masquerade.
The juniors and seniors of the high
school enjoyed a most fantastic mas
querade party in the gymnasium last
Saturday evening. About 50 appeared
in costumes of various colors and
styles. The party was in the nature of
a Hallowe'en celebration and a ver V
delightful evening was reported by all
who attended.

The assessment roll of the Pioneer
Irrigation District has been turned
over to Treasurer Lyon. The assess

year the assessment was $1.65.
The assessment would have been

OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT
SCHOOLS IS IMPORTANT
Is Submerged Under Wave of Non
partisanship This Year.
Of the numerous offices which the
voters are to fill, or rather refill, at
the November election, at least two
important oftices will be submerged
under the wave of partisanship that
accompanies a national election.
Both of these offices have no relation
to, and should remain unaffected by
national and state questions. These
are the state superintendeucy and the
county superintendency.
Wonders could be worked in raising
the standard of rural education if
these offices, especially the latter,
could be removed from the realm of
politics. The least that can be done
in the present month, preceding the
election, is to advocate for the im
partial consideration of the merits
oi each candidate for the office of
county superintendent on the basis o£
her professional efficiency as a teach
er and supervisor, upon her education
al leadership, upon her program of
educational reform and social reform
for the rural community.
The school board members and
teachers can here render a distinct
service as individual citizens by argu
ing for the obliteration of party lines
and by standing publicly and earnestly
in favor of the best candidate in their
respective communities.—The Ameri
can School Board Journal.
The Republicans of Canyon county
have a nominee who should realize on
the nonpartisanship of the office
owing to her pre-eminent ability and
vast experience in public school work.
Miss Apphia L. Robinson has 18 years
experience as a teacher. For five years
she was at the head of the Fruitland
chool, the biggest rural high school in
the northwest. Miss Robinson had a
splendid education when she began
teaching and has since taken post
graduate courses at the University of
Chicago and other colleges.
The parents of Canyon county will
make no mistake by electing Miss
Robinson superintendent of schools.

dist church for next Sunday afternoon,

VETERAN ANSWERS
LAST ROLL CALL
James 11. Lybolt was born April 16,
1846, at Beaverdams, New York, and
died October 24, 1916, near Caldwell,
Idaho, having reached the good old
age of 70 years and more.
He enlisted in the Union army in
May, 1862, with 107th New York vol
unteer infantry, and with his company
was assigned to the army of the
Potomac. He was in the famous battle
of Gettysburg and many others of the
notable engagements, and marched
with Sherman to the sea.
At the close of the war and the final
review, he returned home and to the
peaceful pursuits of life, like a good
American citizen ought. Four broth
ers with him marched under the Stars
and Stripes. Soon after returning
home My Lybolt emigrated to Ne
braska and took up a homestead where
he suffered all the hardships of those
early days in the state. About this
time he was married to his first wife,
who died some 15 years ago. To this
union there was born one son. W. S.
Lybolt, who now resides at Winne
toon, Neb., with his wife and two
children, George and Viola Lybolt.
After leaving the homestead Mr. Ly
bolt engaged in the harness business
and other lines of trade.
Returning to Beaverdams, New
York, he was in 1906 married to his
present wife, who with a stepson, O.
L. Stevens, with other neighbors and
friends remain to mourn their loss.
For a number of years Mr. Lybolt
lias been an honored member of the
Methodist church 011 Pleasant Ridge,
where he will be greatly missed.
The funeral services were in charge
of his pastor, the prayer being offered
by the Rev. W. S. Hawkes and the
sermon by the Rev. J. D. Gillilan, D.
1)., a long time friend of the family.
The beautiful flora! offerings bespoke
the higli esteem in which he was held.
The remains were laid to rest in

A Lucky Investment.
Speaking of potatoes, S. Vanhyning
tells a story with some point to it.
Early in the - fall before the present
high prices were anticipated, lie en
gaged a car of tubers of Mr. C. F.
Smith of Deer Flat, at 80 cents per
hundred. Prices soared past the dol
lar mark and Mr. Smith offered to
retain the car at $1.20, but Mr. Van
hyning thought not. The offers to re
purchase kept pace with the rise in
potato prices until a deal was finally
concluded at $2.20 per hundred, the
potatoes never having left the hands
of the original owner. Mr. Smith, who
was glad to get them back at those
figures.

PROMINENT MAN FROM
SOUTHEAST IN CITY
I. B. Evans Says Southern Idaho is
Sate for Hughes and Davis.
I. 1). Evans, former representative
iu the legislature from Oneida county,
and a well known real estate man of
i'reston, was iu the city a few hours
\\ edncsday. Mr. Evans came to Cald
well to see Governor M. Alexander,
Idaho's itinerant governor was caught
on the run in this city alter Mr. Evans
had visited Boise in order to get the
hiei executive of the great state of
Idaho located.
Mr. Evans says that southeast Idaho
is safe tor Hughes and Davis by an
old time Republican majority oi troni
ten to fifteen thousand, lie expects
to see Idaho go Republican with a
whoop. Mr. Evans says the statement
that Utah is in the doubtful column is
ridiculous. Utah is as safe for Hughes
and Fairbanks as it has ever been.
Preston Flourishing.
Mr. Evans states that crops have not
been as good in his section the past
wo years as they are normally. Trade
is quiet and real estate is at a stand
still. Preston has had a greath growth
during the past ten years and is now
one of the best and most flourishing
cities in southern Idaho. Mr. Evans
expects to see several years of great
prosperity following the election oi
Mr. Hughes and the restoration oi
cont'idence in the government.
Mr. Evans returned to Boise Wed
nesday evening and left for home
Friday.
The True Basis of Civil Law Justifies
the Elimination of Liquor Traffic.
Many good people not among the
intemperate class look with disfavor
011 every effort legally to suppress the
liquor traffic, believing that such a
measure would interfere with personal
rights. We would like to present the
following facts for the careful consid
eration of all such persons.
The sale of dangerous toys and
weapons and poisons is prohibited or
restricted by law because they are a
menace to life and property. How
about the sale of intoxicating drinks?
Do they not endanger the life and
comfort and happiness of the people
in the community where they are sold
and used?
The saloon is a consumer and
waster of all that is good and useful
and is a producer of only irreparable
evil. h has 110 economic value to
accrue to the individual or the nation
in final results. The more it induces a
man to spend for booze, the less he
will have for shoes; the more he
spends for wet goods, the less he will
have for dry goods; the more he gives
to the bartender, the less he will have
for Iiis family.
The many cruel deeds committed by
men nerved by intoxicants proves be
yond a question that drink endangers
not only property but life also.
What, then is the matter with this
whole liquor business? 1 am sure you
are ready to agree with me that the
strongest impeachment against it is
that it is a perpetual menace to life,
property, charity, and reputation,
Every principle of law involved in
human rights may be justly invoked
against it.
To prohibit its manufacture and sale
is no infringement of any man's
rights, for no man has a right to dam
age himself or family with the drink
habit, and 110 man has a natural right
to blast the reputation or prospects of
his offspring, and no man has a civil
right to force the community to re
pair the damage and sustain the losses
he inflicts on it when because of drink
he brutalizes himself and debases
others.
Let us on November 7th next defend
our natural and constitutional rights
which the liquor traffickers are tramp
ling underf oot with impunity, by
voting for prohibition.
Yours for temperance,
R. W. AIREY.
Sufferer at Rest.
Mrs. Marv E. Smith passed away at
the home of her daughter, Mrs. J. C.
Ford in this city, Monday afternoon,
death being due to bronchial pneu
monia. Mrs. Smith was born in Rus
selville, Mo., in 1850, being 66 years
old at the time of her death. She
moved with her parents to Salem,
Ore., when three years of age, being
by adoption a western woman. For
thirty-six years she has made her
home near Caldwell, and for the past
nine years has shared the home of her
daughter in this city. She has been a
sufferer with rheumatism for many
years, a helpless invalid. Mr. and Mrs.
Ford took her to Portland and re
mained four years in the hope of bene
fitting her health, but to no avail.
Besides her daughter in this city, she
leaves to mourn her loss two sons—
W. W. Smith of Owyhee, Ore., and
Geo. V. Smith of Rockville, both of
whom were present at the funeral
which was held at the Ford home on
Belmont, Wednesday afternoon. The
service was conducted by Rev. Vance
of the Presbyterian church. Interment
was in Canyon Hill cemetery.

ALEXANDER IS STEADILY
PUBLIC SENTIMENT
Boise, Idaho-—There were three out
standing ieatures connected with the
last week ot the political campaign
111 Idaho.
First, the unmistakable trend of
sentiment away troni Governor Alex
ander 111 all south Idaho counties
where lie was strongest two years ago,
notably Ada, Canyon, Washington and
Twin i'alls.
Second, the growing sentiment tor
Hughes 111 the state was iurthcr re
jected by the iact that the Capital
News came out strongly for the Re
publican candidate for president al
though it is an independent Democratic
paper, ft urges Iiis election as the
only means oi preventing a return,
alter the European war, of the hard
times that were experienced in this
country under the VVilsou administra
tion before the war began.
Slap at Borah.
The third feature has to do with a
movement of considerable proportion
that is said to have been started by
President Wilson himself and directed
against Senator Borah, of Idaho.
It will be recalled that former Sena
tor Fred T. Dubois recently visited
Idaho in the interest of the Wilson
campaign.
Some of the indiscreet one to
whom he gave his confidence have
since been talking and what they have
said has been verified by circumstan
tial evidence as well as by statements
secured ironi the Democratic head
quarters at Chicago, where Mr. Dubois
made his report.
Why They Hate Borah.
Senator Borah has been the most
active and effective speaker against
Wilson during the campaign. He has
spoken all over the country and has
flayed Wilson unmercifully. This has
aroused the spirit of bitter retailiation
and. acting upon the wishes of the
president himself, the national Demo
cratic managers, two weeks ago set
the machinery in motion with the pur
pose not only to capture for Wilson
the electoral vote of Idaho, normally a
Republican state, which is apparently
a minor consideration, but to "get
Borah," humiliate him in his own
state, discredit him in the nation,
weaken his influence as a leader in
congress aind lay the foundation for
his possible defeat two years hence.
Republicans Aroused.
These disclosures have created a
profound impression in the capital
city and in all places in the state where
the facts have become known.
Because of this unusual attack and
the motives behind it, it is barely pos
sible the national committee will re
lease Senator Borah from his engage
ment so that he may make a few more
speeches in Idaho and assist in carry
ing Idaho for Hughes.
Reports From the North.
Especially encouraging are the re
ports from north Idaho. Hughes and
Davis, according to carefully checked
reports to headquarters here, will
carry every county in the north, with
the possible exception of two, by sub
stantial majorities.
"LITTLE GIRL" FILM A LESSON
(By Juanita Gray)
gnorance of the details of the ap
prenticeship and environment of the
alleged "oldest profession" is now
inexcusable. "The Little Girl Next
Door," housed at the La Salle Opera
House until the masses evict her, lets
all, except minors, in on her "secrets.''
This film is, as advertised, a "startling
expose of vice." You will do some
hard thinking after leaving this re
cent home of Charles Caplin's "Car
men." What you will think about
and what decisions you will come to
is a matter of your individuality.
"The Little Girl" celluloid is based
011 the hyper-unusual details given
the Illinois Senate Vice Commission.
Founded thus 011 fact, it is not in a
class with other underworld subjects.
