HUGH EGAN MARRIED
AT ST. PAUL-
Last Wednesday at St. Paul
occurred the marriage of Hugh
Egan to Miss Hazel McCarthy of
Flaxviile Monan'a.. While the
news did not come as a great
surprise to Hugh's friends here,
as it was generally thought that
he was contemplating the deed,
it was not known that the event
was to take place Wednesday and
as a result we have not been able
to get the particulars.
Mr. Egan is too well known to
our readers to need any introduc
tion, being the president of the
Beach State Bank of this city and
the Security Bank of Golva. Miss
McCarthy is a very charming
young lady, possessing many ad
mirable qualities and accomplish
ments and has a large number of
friends in Beach, gained during
her visits here.
The Chronicle joins with their
many friends in extending con
gratulations and wishing them all
the good things in life.

keep a good sized family in fire
wood forever.
The W. Bar ranch was the first
ranch properly owned by Pierre
Wibaux and was his home for a
goodly number of years. There
is a good set of buildings on it
with a big basement barn 30x75
and the whole place is fenced and
cross fenced. While about half
of Ihe land is suitable for agri
culture it is Mr. Wicka's inten
sion to use it almost exclusively
for grazing, wilh the exception of
enough which to raise necessary
feed. Beaver dams, are in abun

PARALYSIS SPREADS.
Hettinger Cou,nly Herald—In
fantile paralysis, the disease that
claimed thousands of babies and
small boys and girls the past year,
has been spread to the rural dis
tricts by the catalogue houses.
Goods thai have been returned
to Ihe catalogue houses liave in
many instances come from homes
where Ibis dread disease has
claimed ils victims and left its
poison. It is easy to see how all
kinds of disease may be passed
around by these mail order
houses lliat send goods out prom
iscuously and when they arc
returned pass Ihe stuff on and on
until someone accepts the junk.
Fortunately, there have been only
a few cases in North Dakota, and
only in districts where goods
were accepted from catalog
houses.
A goodly number of friends
of Mrs. O. D. Brault gathered at

FARMERS' EXTENSION LEC
TURES ARE SUCCESSFUL
Hugo Kluiiib, accompanied by
A. B. Hummel and .M. Lewis
auloed to the Little Beaver school
last Friday and to the Haysmau
school last Saturday and gave
very interesting extension lect
ures. About one hundred lantern
slides were used in connection
which illustrated the lecture mag
nificently.
Mr. Klumb's subject was 'HortL
culture" and he gave the audience
some very interesting and profit
able information on how to plant
fruit trees, when lo plant, what
kind to plant, exposure, how to
take care of the trees, their dis
eases and how to overcome them,
insects which attack them and
how lo kill them, spraying and
he best method of spraying, etc.
Mr. Klumb used good, clear eff
ective English, making it very
easy for the farmers to under
stand, and profit by this useful
information, Mr. Lewis gave a
very helpful talk on "Methods of
Bookkeeping on the Farm" which
had the undivided attention of the
assembly.
Lectures will be given at the
Burkey school house Friday No

seem to the writer that every
voter in the county and on the

lo our heads of families .that they
would not have to send their
children to Valley City in order
lo have the children's education
advanced and we can't see why
anyone in this section of the state
should vote against it.
