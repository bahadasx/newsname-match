M November 7.
Mr. Wilson arrived at the Twenty-sev
enth street entrance at the Madsn

It tepk the pelle seven minutes to foes
a pasage way through the throng.
In pefeel rhythm the audiene began

soul" Thin deaosratioa lasted for ff
teen minutes before Mr. Wilson raised his
hand& for eiet. The crowd started.agsin,
but In eight minutes more a hush fell
over the audience.
Mr. Wilson said that the United
states was face to face with one of
the mest serious turning points in the
history of the country.
"22e campaign may be said to be
practically at an end." he said. "but
* abould give serious thought to,
what It has disclosed. We find again
that a small body of men are seeking
to control the business development
of the country."
Touching briefly on foreign rela
tions. Mr. Wilson charged:
"Some men have even sought to dis
credit our own government In the
face of most delicate foreign situa
lions. They have sought to shame
the Country for personal or political
0 advantage."
The eight-hour law and many other
topics already discussed by the Presi
dent during the campaign were men
tioned briefly.
Speaks at Coeper Unen. -
In concluding his address. Mr. Wilson
said with dramatic emphasis:
"The forces of the nation are gather
ing from a demonstration of the power
of public opinion on November 7, in a
way the world has never seen before."
The Madison Square Garden speech was
the second of the day. At a luncheon
tendered by the Busines Men's League
in the Waldorf. more than 1.010 persons
heard Mr. Wilson expound the issues
upon which he had based his campaign.
The third speech was made at Cooper
Union. after 10 O'clock tonight.
Confusion and some amusement were
caused by a mistake in seating arrange
ments at the President's table during the
nloon luncheon. Secretary of the Treas
ury William G. McAdoo was assigneg to
a place at the right of William F. Me
,ombs. Senatorial candidate in New
York. Mr. McCombs and Mr. McAdoo
were very active in electing Mr. Wilson
four years ago. but ohs that time, a
story goes, their friendshI has not bee
of the sort that placed then ttena. at
peablic functins.
When the two gentlemen observed the
mistake that had been made, they turned
and bowed formally. They did not shake
hands.

until after the election.
The department's decision will be

sengers and crew If the Marina was a
peaeale merobanman.

The question was raised in the

As a result of the first day's action. the
Italians have not only carried a strong
syten of defenses on the heights east of
Gorizia and another powerful line on
the Carso east of Vallen, but have taken
.730 prisoners, six can(on. mary machine
runs, and vast quantities of war material.
The new offensive was launched yester
Alv. The first official words of it reach
Irg Rome were given out today in a war
efficial statement.
This statement declares that the
Austrian lines were penetrated at sev
eral points. notably south of the Oppa
chlesella-Castagnavizza road. where the
Italian gains were completely held. de
spite the most violent counter-attacks.
In the Caso plateau the Italians at
points advanced almost a mile. East of
Segiti two-thirds of a mile of strong po
sitions were won.
The advance was made across treacher
ous ground, soaked by the recent rains.
Gen. Cadorna struck at the moment
when the weather cleared.
Sharp, but not especially prolonged, ar
tillery preparatm preceded the storming
actions.
