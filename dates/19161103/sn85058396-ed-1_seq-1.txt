REVOLUTION
INJREECE
Paris, Nov. 2. After months of
strife between the adherents of for
mer Premier Venlzelos and adherents
of King Constantine over the ques
tion of Greece's stand in the war, a
revolution of considerable proportions
has broken out in thet region south
west of Salonlki. Six hundred insur
gents, probably followers of Venlzelos,
forced 150 royalist troops to evacuate
Katerlna and retreat upon Larissa, 40
miles southwest, in Thessaly, where
they are expected to receive reinforce
ments. The troops have received or
drs from the king to prevent at all
costs ihe advance of the revolution
ists. On the fighting fronts important
successes have been obtained by the
French in the regaining of Fort Vaux,
northeast of Verdun; by the Italians
in a further push forward in the
Gorizia and Carso t sectors through
which they are trying to reach Triest
and by the Germans in Volhynia near
Witoniez, where Russian positions
were stormed and captured and 22 of
ficers and 1,508 men were made pris
oner. The Transylvania theatre is wit
nessing a continuation of the advance
of the Austro-Germans south of the
Rothenthurm Pass, while in the Jiul
valley the Rumanians are keeping up
their pursuit of the Teutons.

RUMANIAN SITUATION
OVERSHADOWS MINOR
EPISODES IN RUSSIA
Petrograd, Nov. 2, 12:45 p. m., via
London, 5:45 p. m. Interest in the
Rumanian situation continues to over
shadow minor episodes on the Rus
sian western front, particularly since
the approach of winter already has
precluded the possibility -of further
operations on a large scale in this
theatre.
There has been, however, a notice
ably growing tendency on the part of
the Germans to begin a more or less
serious offensive at various points in
Galicia, the most important of which
is the one undertaken south of Brze
zany where the Russian positions
along the Narayuvka river have of
fered exceptional advantages for a
flanking attack upon. Hallcz from the
north and at tho same time constitut
ing a direct menace to Lemberg.
The Germans aimed thrusts all
along tho line from Brzezany to Halicz
but concentrating most heavily in the
region of Michishou wood, began a
determined attack on the night of Oc
tober 29, which carried the Russian
positions.
Russian critics, although manifestly
surprised at the German ability to
launch an offensive of large forces at
this point, do not consider the hostile
advance over a six-mile front of more
than local importance, and state that
its only significance is in relation to
the Transylvanian operation being an
obvious attempt to create a diversion
and prevent further Russian co-operation
on the Transylvania front, where
General von Falkenhayn, after being
temporarily checked, is. making a new
effort to advance.

MANY SHIPS SUNK
BY BELLIGERENTS
Gross Tonnage of 3,328,584
Sent to Bottom in Twenty
seven Months.
New York, Nov. 3. One thousand
eight hundred and twenty merchant
ships with an aggregate gross tonnage
of approximately 3,32S,584 have been
sunk by belligerent nations during
27 months of war ending November
1, according to figures compiled from
cable despatches and mall advices
published here today by the Jaurnal
of Commerce. The losses during Oc
tober wer larger than for any one of
the preceding months, according to
the statistics, amounting to 12 vessels
of a total of 227,116 tons gross. The
October rate of destruction wa3 con
siderably In excess of the monthly
average throughout a war period and
British shipping sustained losses near
ly equal to those of August and Sep
tember combined. Norway lost tho
largest number of ships, fifty-six, ac
cording to the statistics, but their
gross tonnage was only 57,333 as com
pared with Great Britain's total loss of
115,546 gross tonnage of 38 vessels
destroyed.
A table showing the total shipping
losses since the war began estimates
those of the entente allies at about
75 percent and those ofneutrals at
nearly 17 percent with Teutonic'
losses less than 7 percent.

AMENDMENT NO. I AS I
SEEN BY 0GDEN1TE I
... WHO IS WELL POSTED I
Editor Standard: Fearing that the,
public will not be sufficiently inform
ed as to the difference in questions)
No. 1 and No. 2, I write this article
for publication.
Do the voters of Utah favor receiv
ing the interest on their own money?
If you were a stockholder in any cor
poration, would you be in favor of the
corporation receiving the interest on.
the funds of the corporation deposited
in some bank instead of some officer
of the corporation getting the bene
fits of that interest? Would you, as
an individual, be In favor of collecting
the interest on your own money, even
though It happened to be deposited
in some bank by your clerk?
If you are, then vote "Yes" on No. 1.
Article 7, Section 17, of the Consti
tution as it is at present reads as fol
lows: "The Auditor shall be Auditor
of Public Accounts, and the Treasurer
shall be the custodian of public mon
eys, and each shall perform such oth
er duties as may be provided by law."
The proposed Amendment to the Con
stitution, if carried, will read as fol
lows: "The Auditor shall be Auditor
of public accounts. The public mon
eys shall be deposited by the Treas
urer, under the supervision of the
Board of Examiners, and as provided
by law;"
The' trouble with the conditions as
they exist today is that the Constitu
tion makes the Treasurer the sole cus
todian of public moneys so when you
attempt to direct the treasurer by leg
islatlon to compel him to handle the
money for the uses and benefits of the
taxpayer, he relies on his constitution
al right to do with the money as he
pleases. When I was a member of
the Utah State senate in 1911 and
1913, I filed some bills, proposing to
regulate the money belonging to the
public as handled by the State Teras"
urer, the County Treasurer, the City
Treasurer, the School Treasurer, and
I all other public moneys within the
state, but the "big guns" then in of
fice said that it could not be done
without a Constitutional Amendment
nnrl nonrlv nil tllP "hie ETUns" in the
state senate at that time, during the
session of 1911, voted against the bill.
But finally in 1913, I prepared a bill
that afterwards became a law.
But the legislation was not what I
consider direct legislation. Instead of
saying that these officers MUST do
certain things, and direct them by di
rect legislation, we used this phrase:
"Any public officer having public
funds in his custody MAY deposit the
same, or any part thereof, with any
bank incorporated under the National
Banking Act and doing business in
this state, or with any bank or trust
company Incorporated under the laws
of and engaged In business in this
state; provided, that he required de
pository to pay interest on all fudns
so deposited at a rate of not less than
two per cent (2 per cent) per annum,
an dthat he take from such deposi
tory collateral security or a good and
sufficient surety company bond or a
personal bond approved by him and
sufficient in amount to fully protect
such funds. Provided that the cost
of any official bonds required to be
furnished by any public treasurer
shall be paid out of funds in the re
spective treasurers (treasuries), pro
vided, that tho interest received under
the provisions of this act by the State
Treasurer shall be placed in the gen
eral fund."
So you can sec the law as It is to
day. In the event the Treasurer de
termines not to deposit the money and
keeps it in his own vaults, then there
would be no benefit from interest on
that money to the general public, but
the law above says that if he does
deposit it in any bank that he must
require Buch depository to pay inter
est on all funds so deposited at a rate
of not leBS than two per centum (2
per cen) per annum oh his daily bal
ances. So it Is very important in
order to have direct legislation by
which the treasurers handling the
public moneys of the people of the ll
state of Utah may be directed by law
as to the method of handling that
money, that you vote "Yes" on Ques- frl
tion No. 1 . The proposed Amendment I
gives the Board of Examiners the su- tl
pervision of the public moneys and il
they can be directed by legislation. rl
