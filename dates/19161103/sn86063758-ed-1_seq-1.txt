SINKING OF MARINA
HAY ItAlSE rKOHLK3I>
Washington, Xov. 1.?So many conflicting
elements have appeared in Hitdestruction
of the British ship Marina
by a German submarine, with loss of
American lives. that the incident
threatens to tail m:o a xecnnicai ois- j
cussion rather than a clean cut issue |
q{ whether or not Germany has vio-j
lated her pledges to the United States.
It became apparent today that
much which is essential to a determination
of the responsibility remains
*" undisclosed if indeed the United
States, Germany or Great Britain are
in possession of the full facts.
It appeared certain, however, that
no move will be made by the United
States until the German version of
the affair, as well as the destruction
of the tsritisn snip Kawanmore uy
shell fire, with endangering of Americans,
has been obtained.
The only positive developments towere
the action of Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
in asking his government to forward
aB details by wireless, and the issuance
of a statement hy Secretary
^ "Lansing, that the investigation would
l>e in no wise delayed because there
is a political campaign in progress.
TTHis was Mr. jL#ansing s su&ieuiem.
"That a political campaign is in
progress will in no way affect the!
k practice of the department in negotiL
3 ting and in making full investigation
Lof cases of this sort. TOle shall do it
| as we always have with as much cef
lerity as possible.
"I wish also to make another statement
on a matter which has been
"brought to my attention. The question
has been raised as to whether the
policy of the president or the de
partment in regard to submarine warsince
the Sussex was sunk ha=
r been changed. I wish to say emphatically
that there has been no change
ix any particular."

AN INTERESTING LETTER i
FR03I THE BORDER
31r. T. Earlo Bullock Tells How tli-'

a Little Home Sick.
Camp Stuart.
El Paso. Texas, Oct. 18, 1916.
The Herald and News,
.Newberry. S. C.
uear .vir. auh:
I have noticed in several South Carolina
papers letters written by the
boys here, of our camp life and our
work iiere on the border and thought
that some of our Newberry people
ttchtM like to know that the Newberry
boys are doing their part of everythins
and' are making good in every
thin<r and when the call-is sounded
to do anything in the line of dutr
they are all right there on the jo^>
to do whatever falls their lot to do.
On Sunday morning, October 1st, at
7:30 o'clock the bugle sounded the
fall in call, and we all fell in line
with all of our equipment on, which
consisted of our side arms with our j
I trenching tools on them, then our j

them together weighed about fifty |
! pounds or a little less, and then we j
! started on the march of about fifty j
! six miles down through New Mexico, j
j The first day we made thirteen miles.
1 We reached our camping place about
two o'clock. The next day we only j
made five miles; then on Tuesday wo j
! made ten miles, and Wedneacday we |
| rested all day at a small town in!
I New Mexico, Anthpny. Thursday and '
( Friday we made thfe:rest of our hike j
I which ended at Las Cruses, New Mex- I
j ico. We reached camp at about five.
I o'clock.
Old South Carolina held the record
and the 1st regiment never lost a
man. The second regiment lost three.
That is something no other State can
say.
We were to stay tftere until the
following Wednesday but we started
back on Tuesday morning.
But I must tell you what we did
while there from Saturday morning
until Tuesday morning. On Satur-1
day morning we were to have a sham {
battle, but we drove the enemy back
ir? a ?bort while. On Sunday was an-1
other rest day. Monday morning wo j
started out on the war path again and
across the hills and valleys we went, |
i and then away up on a little hill we
! had to dig a trench five feet deep j
I and three feet wide. ,
We received orders to start back
to Camp Stewart on Tuesday morning.
We were all glad to hear that
order. U only rained once on us going
to Las Cruses, but after we starten
back it rained on us every even-1
ing and every morning just as we
started to march, but we stood it all
and kept in good cheer and Thursj
day afternoon we camped only ninej
teen miles from ICamp Stewart. Friday
morning it was raining and we
received orders to go into camp that
day, so out we started for Camp
Stewart. We had about two miles in
i mud about ankle deep, most of it was
at least, but the rest of the road was
good cement road all the \vf.y and
we were able to make good time. We
halted at twelve o'clock at Smelter,
Texas, for dinner. We spent thirty
minutes at rest and we also made the
? " *'1 Vi rt J "VlO ??/! fo nl* ^ f T*
yUl K cllIU UC?H3 auu naivi wivi\ nj i.v??
a few minutes. Then again we were
on the road and at five thirty we
came into camp and this waJ some
happy bunch of soldier boy<? Old
South Carolina boys made the best
record of all the States; both regi
ments lost only five men. though tfie
1st regiment lost only one man t-nd
he was from Co. C. The 2nd regiment
lost four men. There were
about eighteen thousand men out or
the hike. The states were Massachusetts,
Ohio, Michigan, South Carolina
and Kentucky.
I said a few minutes ago it was
I
eighteen thousand, it was between
that and twenty thousand men in all.
With, all of them in a line and the
wagons all in line, you could se? a
string of men just as far a> you could
see. marching on and on. It v.-as a
sight worth seeing to see them all. 1
We South Carolina boys all want to
/
come back to dear old South Carolina, f
but while we are here we are going I
to do whatever our duty is without j
a murmur. '\Y'e canftot tell yet when '
we will be ordered to come r ck 10 i
f i
South Carolina but we think we will i
be on our road back home about the
] 1st of November.
We started back to drill again yesJ
terday morning. We only have to drill
from seven thirty in the morning until
ten thirty, then the rest of the
day we can do as we please. We
also have nieture shows to go to ev
! cry night and we have Y. M. C. A. j
i buildings here also. 0' r old Y. C.
A. tent that we had at Styx, S. C..
i came the other day so now South
1 I
i Carolina b-oys have a Y. M. ('. A. tent
! of their o"*vn.
f
We have gotten some copies of Tin
Herald and News since we have oeen
here and we always appreciate getting i
I .
[a copy for it is always like a letter)
J from home, s~weet home.
! There is a big sand storm coming j
> , i
| up ncrw* and I must get to my tent I
; and hide to keep from being covered
j with sand. If it were not for these
sand storms and being so far from
1 home we would like this place fine.

Here is hoping to be in dear old

HALLOWE'EN PARTY GIYEX

fun was their reward. Snook",

while an array of jack-o'lanterns lent
a weird light to the ghostly seen*
\fter an impressive spook parade, the
survivors of the spectacle were* in
vited downstairs with the promise Oi
\xrious midway attractions and toothsome
refreshments for a cask consid- j
eration. The midway only lacked a
staff of snielers to be "a howling sue
cess." "The only 'possum in captiv- J
ity was enough to tempt the klrp-'
tomaniacal propensities of a country
darkey; the "greatest known freak in

upon this as a "reflection" but no
breach of the peace followed. In the

have escaped from "Buffalo Bill" in

read horoscopes for all comers and
five cents and had the most upright

The refreshments, furnished bv the

as the net proceeds of $S.OO clearly

All in all, it was a most successful
entertainment. This was due largely
to the indefatigable exertions of Misses

Campaign trusts that the readers of

him, if he, for the purpose of illustration,
applies it to this Campaign. Because,
you see, it fits so elegantly into
what he has been preaching for the

of Extra 'Votes and Prize Ballots.
Saturday- night, November 4, this |
extra vote period will end. That is
right; at that time the Larget Extra

Prize Ballots, positively the greatest
opportunity that will be offered
will end.
It you have not yet completed two j
or three clubs of SI2.00 in subscrip- j
