NFAV YO ILK, Nov. ?.. Experi

the election b tting in Wall Ft. i
being manipulated in the interest of
Hughes. The change from even
money, the condition which prevail
a few days ago, to 10 to S and even
10 to 7 in favor of Hughes has been
too precipitate to ;ulmit of any other
explanation. This theory i home
out by the lavish manner in which
the wealthy hackers of Hughes are
.-pending money to advance his
cause, the most patent manifesta
tion of which is furnished by patres
f advertising the interests are buy
ing in newspapers throughout the
country.
"Those who have had any experi

"It is indeed an open question

a week ago wanted to get stocks

anxioas to pet them up, have not
hm manipulating the betting odds.
There is no law against 'matched
orders' in th betting ring."
Everyone who realizes what is at
stake In the election knows that
Wall Ft. could well afford to spend
ten millions to return the republi
cans to power, in the confident ex
pectation of overturning the federal
reserve act, and gettins: the power
to create panics again in their

pect of again imposing a monopoly
tariff upon the people.

bought there and they felt certain
that the men would return for more.

The 110th st. explosion came near
being a great tragedy. Two minutes

sued this statement:
"We hivt eidence that the funds
financing this explosion and other
contemplated explosions, came from
the Carmen's union. We are on the
trail leading to other arretts and

confession, has furnished the trail."
The first clew that the police got
was the discovery of live fulminating
caps and some fuse in Central park,
just after the 110th st. explosion.

International News Service:
WASHINGTON, Nov. ' 3. The
question of violation of Germany's
submarine warfare pledges in the

it uncertain whether they will ever

The department, is awaiting con
