Flour output In Minneapolis end
ing Oct. 21, 391,000 bbls. vs. 490,
000 a year ago. If the mills should
run night and day for the next six
months they could not catch up with
tho late summer and fall customary j
production. A large Indiana rciui
asuea a statement to tnoir tiauo
aomonswaung mat nour is tno
cheapest food after all and requests
that the peoplo do not subscribe to
the popular fallacy that it is high.
Moat contains CO per cent water, po
tatoes 75 per cent, milk 90 per cent
and flour only 131 per cent; a
pound of meat costs 20c to 25c, flour
4c, yet there is more energy in a
pound of flour than in a pound of
beef.

THE OUTLOOK. .
Tho gieat battle of the polls will
come next Tuesday and the indications
now presage Republican victory, but
the result is likely to bo very close
so close that there is the possibility of
another Demociatic victory. Tho fact
that business is booming in this coun
try will help the Wilson cause might-
lv. The nntion-wiik' straw vote taken
by the New York Herald indicates Re
publican success. In all the New
England states, execptrng possibly
Connecticut Hughes has a long lead.
The Hurt ford Courant, a staunch Re
publican paper, scoffs at the claim that
Conneiticut is doubtful, nnd to support
its claim it points out that four yearn
ato when Wilson earrieu trie stare ru-
lacked 10,000 of a majority. If the
Progressive vote swings back to the
Republican fold in Connecticut as it
did in Maine in tho state elections
there is no question about the result
pinoug the nutmeggcrs.
It is the western, or rather middle
western states, where it is difficult to
make predictions witlr any degree of
necurncv. Ohio is in an unsettled con
dit ion. Indiana is always lighting
ground in n nntional election. Illinois
is a state which makes sudden shifts.
In a larKO port of tho country it is cvi
dont that tho so-cnlled pro-QerniaJt vote
is for Hughes, but tlris is said not to be
tho case in Wisconsin, whero thcro is
mi immense vote frorrr citizens of Ger
man extraction.
New York is counted as safely for
Hughes, although the Democratic lead
eis will not concede this. Hughes mado
a remarkable record as a man of re
sourcefulncss and courage as governor
of tho Empire state and is stronger
there than any candidate the Reptibll
cans could have nnincd.
An impartial newspaper rami wlto has
been all over the country for weeks.
carefully gathering data as to tho prob
able vote for President, working in the
interests of a group of papers desiring
to get onlv the facts, sums up his do
dttctions ns follows, after traveling
.10,000 miles:
Hushes is reasonably sure of 20
states, having, all told, 22!) clectora
votes, the states being California, Del
aware, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Mnine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New
Hampshire, New .Jersey, Now York,
North Dakota. Oregon, Pennsylvania
Rhode, Island. South Dakota, Utah
Vermont nml Wyoming.
Wilson is reasonably sure of 1.1
states, having altogether Ml electoral
votes, i. e.. the "solid South" and
Nebraska and Oklahoma.
Seven states, witli SI electoral votes
lean strongly to Hughes, and, barring
some unforeseen developments, he is al
most sure to carry them, although most
of them lire close.
Eight states, with 7-1 eleetornl votes
are hanging irr the balance, just about
as likely to go one way as tho other.
The total number of electoral votes
will bo 5.11, and the necessary numbe
to elect, 2fi(i. Allowing HughcH the 22
above enumerated, ho would need only
117 more to mako his election sure,
is believed he can get this number, or
more, from those states now classed n
doubtful.
Ts vour naine on the check list?
Remember Nov, 7. It is the duty n
every voter to go to tho polls.
The Concord, N. II., Monitor, makes
good point when it says next Tuesdn
will he Hughes day.
Tho I'rovidonco Journal, which is
pretty reliable nowspnpor, claims that
tho eonl shortago is largely fictitious
It bases this opinion on tho fact that
tho anthracite bureau of information a
Wllkes-Hnrio reported that f i" tho nine
months ending Sept. 1 the hard coal
output exceeded tho production of tho
corresponding period of n year ago b,
1,37:1,000 tons, or threo per cent. Tho
Journal admits tlint freight car short,
ago makes deliveries slow, but says
tlint nn ample supply of coal hns been
mined, and tlint thcro is enough to go
around if tho transportation facilities
can lie properly utilized.
When Gov. Horace P. Graham, to he,!
strikes out for retrenchment in stato
expenses ho will undoubtedly give at
tention to our courts, ns well as to our
numerous commissions. The increase
n tho cost of our department of jus-
ice cnnnot bo satisfactorily explained.
The St. Johnsbury Caledonian and the
Bnrro Times nre two papers which have
been handling this subject without
gloves. The Times in n recent article
made this striking comparison: "Per
haps it will be well to comparo the
cost of courts in Vermont with some
other states. The Financial Statistics
of States for !l."i, issued by tho census
bureau, shows the costs of courts in
Vermont witli air estimated population
of 3G1.S2S, for that year to be $292,578;
n New Hampshire witli a population of
4.18,021, $71,71.'; in Maine with n popu-
ation of 702,787, $S2,0G7; in Minnesota
with a population of 2,200,2.15, $210,142.
Those figures indicate a need on the
part of the voters to dabble n little
witlr the Vermont courts."
Horace F. Graham, in his address in
St. Johnsbury Friday night, stated if
elected governor a superfluous state
nient at the start he would givo his
fust attention to state expenses. In
the 14 years that he has been auditing
state accounts the expenses of the state
have increased in round figures from
$1,000,000 to $2,500,000. Ho believes
the 05 state boards and commissions
could be cut in two without impairing
efficiency. Mr. Graham has an opporttt
nity to do a great work as governor
to mako a name for himself that will
go resounding down the ages in his own
state. If he can get the legislature to
co-operate with his recommendations ho
ought to bo able to get more and better
work out of our stato departments than
heretofore and nt a greatly reduced
cost. Mr. Graham knows the ins and
outs of state affairs and stato business
probably better than any man in tho
entire state. The opportunity will bo
before Mr. Graham and wo hnvo full
confidence that when ho gets into the
chief executive's chair ho will arise to
thc'cmergcncy nnd give the stato a not
able administration.
VERMONTERS' OOOD SHOWING.
Students from tho University In Bur
lington Won Third Prize in Judging
Contest.
At tho recent Nntional dairy show-
held irr Springfield, Mass., for the first
tune a butter judging contest was held.
ino teams were entered, including
teams representing Cornell, Ohio stato
university, Nebraska university, South
Dakota Agricultural college, Massachus
etts Agricultural college, Connecticut
Agricultural college, University of Ver
mont and Pennsylvania State college.
Kighteen tubs of butter were furnished
for the judging contest. The Univer
sity of Vermont secured third prize,
winning $50 in gold. Tho first prize
was worr by Pennsylvania Stato college
and the second by South Dakota.
Tile Vermont team consisted of G. E.
Stevens of Pittsford Mills, II. H. Met-
calf of Williston, D. S. Jones of Ran
dolph, and A, C. Lewis of Poultncy (al
ternate).
Vermont also entered a team 111 the
stock judging contest. Eighteen tennis counting of the ballots for town renre
wero entered nnd although Vermont 1 sentntive will begin immediately upon
won no prize, the experience was a val-'the closing of tho ballot box. In tho
liable one. Tins was the first tune tlint nvpnt thnt nnillier nf on,wri,iotnJ
the University of Vermont lias entered
this competition. The Vermont team
consisted of E. M. Root of North Crnfts -
bury, I. N. Bartlett of Middle Gran
villo, N. Y., F. R. Churchill of South
Londonderry, and F. J. Carpenter of
Morrisville (alternate). It is -hoped
that tho University will bo nblo to
continue to send teams to participate
in these contests.
The competition on tho part of the
university was made possiblo by tho
generosity of several organizations nnd
individuals. The Agricultural club
the university paid part of tho expenses
nnd tiro sum of $11 was contributed by
F. A. Kennedy of Windsor, a Jersey
breeder, J. G. Howlnnd of Qucclieo Fells
farm, Quechee, a Jersey breeder, B. C.
Buxton of Middleton Springs, a Hoi
Btein breeder, G. T. Chaft'eo of Rutland,
a Jersey breeder, A. A. Dunkleo of
South Vernon, a Jersey breeder, and
Willey Brothers of Cambridge, Jersey
and Holstcin breeders. Tho U. V. M.
Short Course association also assisted in
raising tho fund.
Sells Farm Ho Howed from Forest.
Judith Hiooks lias sold his 160-ncre farm
near May pond, Baitorr, to Louis Aticliu
of Sherbrooke, Que. There is more than'
usual interest in the sale of this property
ns Mr. lltooks bought this 1C0 acres 4.1
years ngo of J. C. Nonis of Morrisville. It
was forest land, but Mr. and Mrs. Brooks
went onto the hind and there erected a log
house in which they lived a few years.
In the meantime, Mr. Brooks was clearing
the laud nnd making tho fields productive,
-(.-iter lie built modern buildings and
brought the farm to its present Btntc of
productiveness. A fine property nnd lit
erally hewed out of tho forest by dint of
hard nnd continuous labor, where Mr.
lltooks has brought up a family and se
cured a competence. This is an example
of thlift which might well be held up be
fore tho young people of this generation.

HURT AT UNDERPASS
Mrs. Bert Stone of Brattleboro in
Greenfield Hospital
Oar Owned and Driven by Barney Mead
Skidded and Struck Abutment Be
tween South Decrfleld and Whately.
Mts. Bert Stone of Canal street is in
tire Franklin county hospital in Green-
now, .Mass., with injuries to her head
as the result of on automobile accident
Tuesday night at the bad underpass be
tween wnnteiy and South Dccrfield.
Dr. E. G. Best, who is in charge of her
coso said next rnoruiui; that her facw
was so badly swollen that he had not
been able to determine whether thcro
was a fracture of the skull, but thu
physicians hnvo since concluded that
tho skull is not fractured.
The others who were with Mrs. Stone
were all more or less bruised but not
seriously injured. They were her hus
band, Bert Stone, teamster, their
daughter, Hazel, Edward C. Harring
ton and Barney S. Mend, owner nnd
driver of the machine in which thoy
weic ictttrniiig from Springfield to
Brattleboro.
Mr. and Mrs. Stone had engaged Mr.
Mead to take them to Springfield and
get their daughter, who had left her
homo recently, and Mr. Harrington
went witlr them. Thev left there early
Tuesday evening.
The night was very foggy and tho
roads were in bad condition. As. Mr.
Mead approached the underpass, which
has been the scene of several auto
mobile accidents and which is ona of
the worst in Mussnchusetts, he says ho
was running nt a moderate pace but in
the fog misjudged the distance and tho
ear skidded and collided with the north
