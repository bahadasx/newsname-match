Carries Adams Girl Away to
llolton and Weds Her.
FAMILIES ARE CONTENTED NOW
So 3Iore Efforts to Make Boy
Marry Unfortunate.
Assault Case Against Read and
Adams Is Ended.
William Wood made good. When
he offered to square everything up
between the Adams and Read families
by wedding 16-year-old Mary Adams,
thereby giving a name to her un
born child, Hugh MacFarland, judge
of the probate court, said no. He re
fused to issue a license. But a little
thing like that did not deter Wood.
He simply took Mary and went to Hol
ton where the probate judge of Jack
son county joined them in the holy
bonds of matrimony October 27.
Wood is a sort of modern Damon
but the identity of bis Pythias has not
been disclosed. Mary Adams tried to
make a "Pythias" of young Eugene
Read, but he wasn't interested. Even
when his father. Repps Read, and
Mary Adams's father went to the trou
ble of buying a marriage license for
him and Mary he held back. As they
continued to be urgent, using a revol
ver as the principal urge, he arose to
the full height of his 16 years and told
Father Read and Father Adams where
to get off.
Mary Adams said Eugene Read was
responsible for her condition. Eu
gene said Mary was anything but a
truthful girl. Repps Read said Eu
gene was responsible. Eugene told
the county attorney that his father
was responsible for Mary's condition
and was trying to "lay it onto him."
He swore to a complaint charging his
father and William Adams, father of
the girl, with assaulting him.
Cuffs and Kirks.
Eugene declared Read and Adams
hunted him up one dark night about
-two weeka ago.,.a.ud with cuffs and
kicks and a revolver they drove and
led him over to Oakland before J. P.
Williams, justice of the peace. He
declared they had Mary Adams and a
marriage license and that they threat
ened him with various things if he
failed to stand up with Mary and per
mit Justice Williams to periorm the
ceremony. The boy balked and when
Justice Williams learned of the cir
cumstances he refused to give his
services.
That ended proceedings that night
but the next day the boy hunted up
an aunt and uncle and reported at the
court house. He presented his case
to the county attorney and an investi
gation disclosed that the marriage li
cense had been issued by the probate
judge.
Wood Dropped In.
Then the mysterious Wood rut In
his appearance. No one appears to
know from whence he came. He just
dropped casually into the probate
judge's office and offered to be the
goat.
"If it will straighten this matter
out," he said to Judge MacFarland,
"I'll marry this Adr.ms girl. 1 haven't
any particular interest in the case but
there is no sense in all this trouble."
Judge MacFarland tried to find out
more abcut him but learned only that
he had worked during the summer
in Osage county and later up around
Wamego or St. Marys.
"Are you responsible for this girl's
condition?" asked the judge.
"Not on your life," replied Wood.
"Seven months ago I was working In
Osage county. 1 was there before
and after that."
"Well, what's the answer?" said the
judge.
He didn't get the answer and Wnod
didn't get the license. Judge Mac
Farland figured that if Wood married
the girl that would end the case and
the guilty person would not be pun
ished. Already Married.
Wood went away. The assault case
against Repps Read and William
Adams was set for hearing todav in
the court of Topeka. Robert Garver
was over in North Topeka looking up
witnesses and met Mary Adams.
"Say. Mary," said Garver, "I wish
you would tell me why that man
Wood wanted to marry you."
"Why, we are married." she replied.
"What," said Garver, "I thought the
Judge refused the license."
Without answering. Mary went into
the house and brought out a highly
embellished wedding certificate, which
told its own story. It showed that
William Wood and Mary Adams were
marrien by the probate judge of Jack
son county October 27, at Holton
Kan. '
"I guess that settles it," said Garver
Wood was married once before and
s probably 2 5 years of age.

VILLA IN PARRAL?
Refugees Report Bandits Have
Captured Town.
Anxiety Felt for Americans
Known To Be There.
El Paso. Tex., Nov. 3. Much anx
iety Is felt here today for the safety
of nine Americans at Parral. Further
reports of the capture of that impor
tant Mexican town by Villista bandits
on October 81 were brought here from
Chihuahua City today, when the first
train to arrive since Villistas cut the
railway line north of the Chihuahua
capital reached Juarez.
Several Mexican refugees said the
report was current In the capital that
Villa had taken Parral. Confirmation,
however, has not been obtained from
any source and in official quarters
doubt is expressed as there was a
heavy de facto garrison there.
Constant skirmishing was in prog
gress last night between Villistas and
de facto government troops near La
Guna, as the train passed there. Ref
ugees at Juarez stated they heard
heavy firing. All who came on the
train were panic stricken and said
that the City of Chihuahua was in
panic when residents heard that the
bandts were cutting off communica
tion with the north.
Several of the Americans in Par
ral are employes of the Al Varado
Mining and Milling company, with of
fices here. Today the El Paso repre
sentatives of the company stated they
had no communication from their men
ior many days and had no confirma
tion of the capture of the town.
Deny- Villa Has Parral.
New York, Nov. 3. Andres G. Gar
cia. Inspector general of consulates for
the Mexican government now in New
York today received a telegram from
the Mexican consul at Eil Paso, deny
ing the report that Villa had captured
Parral.
The telegram from El Paso said
Carranza troops were in full control
of the place.

INDUSTRIAL COUNCIL BUSY
Final Plans With Executive
Committee Tonight.
Utilities Commission's Old 28
Cent Rate Is Demanded. '
The Topeka Industrial council will
ask the city commission to loan them
an attorney to assist In obtaining an
injunction against the local gas com
pany. Such was a statement made
today by Frank B. Brown, president of
the council.
The council has employed John E.
Addington, an attorney, to represent
it before the Shawnee county district
court. Mr. Addington will meet with
the executive committee of the council
at 7 o'clock tonight and if he report
that he has gained sufficient facts to
go before the court immediately, if it
is ordered, the application for an in
junction will be filed tomorrow.
If People Demand It.
"My understanding is that the city
is willing to enter into the fight if
representatives of the people- will ex
press a desire to go before the courts,"
said Brown. "The Topeka Industrial
Council is certainly representing the
people and the application for an in
junction against the 50-cent gas rate
in effect at the seven homes of the
members of the executive committee,
is merely a means of obtaining a blan
ket injunction against the collection of
the rate thruout the city."
The present plan of the Industrial
Council is to apply for an injunction
on the grounds that the public utili
ties commission has power, given it by
state statutes, to establish rates, and
that the public utilities commission
has established a 28-cent gas rate.
To Hold Mass Meeting
- Until Mr..Addlrigton reports louisbl.
the exact time for a mass meeting can
not be decided upon. ;- At that meet
ing the council hopes to stir up enthu
siasm for its attempt to pull down the
rate and by the temper of the people
shown impress on the city commis
sioners the demand of the people for
one of their representatives, in the
person of the city attorney or an as
sistant, to aid In the fight for an in
junction against the 50-cent gas rate.
"The city attorney is at their dis
posal," said Mayor House.
Tom Doran Laughs.
Tom Doran, attorney for the local
gas company, laughed today at the
threatened injunction against the
company. A whole lot of agitation
that will result in naught, the attor
ney declared.
"The people of Kansas are insured
against any loss if the federal court
should decide to reduce the rate." said
Mr. Doran. "The Kansas Natural was
forced to put up a $75,000 bond for
that very purpose. Meantime, while
the court is deciding the case an in
junction has been made enforcing the
rates in effect in all cities."
DETECT EGGCORNER
Claim Prices Boosted by $7,000,000
Worth in Storage.
Chicago, Nov. 3. Rising: prices of
food products with particular refer
ence to the alleged $7,000,000 egg cor
ner which is said to have boosted the
price ot that eatable to 4 5 cents a
dozen and upward, continued to be the
subject of investigation at the hands
of federal and city authorities here
today.
District Attorney Clyne was to be
asked today to look into the egg ques
tion while Clinton G. Clabaugh, chief
of the bureau of investigation depart
ment of justice, was to hear further
complaints of co-operative grocers
that the National Wholesale Grocers'
association is violating the Sherman
anti-trust law. Market conditions, as
a phase of the high cost of living prob
lem, are to be investigated by the
delegates to the national conference
on marketing and farm credits to be
held here December 4, according to
officers of the conference.
Congressman Fred A. Britton today
said he would introduce a bill in con
gress in December providing for fed
eral control of cold storage plants thru
the interstate commerce commission.
FOOD ON FREE LIST

New Tork, Nov. 3. Victor Carl-
strom swooped down from the sky to
day, landed on Governor's Island and
closed his lightning-like Journey from
Chicago. He had hung up a new
American non-stop record yesterday
and had made his journey at an aver
age speed of more than 110 miles an
hour.
Little more than a speck, he soared
overland just before 9 a. m., after
quitting Hammondsport, N. T 315
miles away, at 6:35 a. m. He circled,
going beyond the island, while New
Yorkers from the skyscraper galleries
watched. Then he swept down from
the air, glided gracefully across the
parade ground and came to an easy
stop.
975 Miles In 8 Hours, 37 Minutes.
His total journey of about 975 miles
was made in eight hours and thirty
seven minutes. Yesterday he made
Erie, Pa., 425 miles from Chicago,
and then had to come down because
just one little loose nut made further
Journeying impracticable.
This shattered his hope of a Chi
cago to New York non-stop trip. But
he swept on to Hammondsport, put
up his monstrous 200 horsepower bi
plane for the night and then arising
early did his 315 miles here in two
hours and twenty minutes.
In breaking his own American non
stop record, he was about 350 miles
behind the European record, approx
imately 800 miles, a journey from the
French lines to Chelm. Poland, by a
French military aviator. -

Says Chairman Lardner.
"REPUBLICANS CLAIM LANDSLIDE
Sessions Won't Glre In an Inch

Lardner Concedes a State Sen
ate and State Ticket.
With Just two working d;-ys remain,
ing before the presidential election,
both Republican and Democrat leaders
today claim Kansas. Hubert Lardner.
Democrat state chairman, and Charles
H. Sessions, head of the Republican
state committee, today made their
final pre-election guesses. Both,
claimed the state for their respective
parties Sessions claiming a clean
sweep, Lardner conceding only the
election of Congressman Anthony and
a Republican state senate and state
ticket.
Claims of party leaders have not
provoked much speculation on Kan
sas results. Nearly all beU in this
state have been placed on national re
sults, with only occasional bets on
state returns. In cases where state
results were the issue. Democrats have
demanded margins of 30,000 to 40,090
votes. A few bets have been placed in
Topeka on this basis, while a few oth
ers have narrowed to Hughes's win
ning the state by 20,000. No specula
tian has been reported on an even
basis of Hughes or Wilson's winning
Kansas.
Hubert Lardner, Democrat chair
man, claims the state for President
Wilson on the assumption that the
women and the labor vote will support
the president. Lardner s figures leave
little for the Republicans in next
Tuesday's election. He claims 90 per
cent of the labor vote of the KtutA
Then he adds 76 per cent of the women
vote to the Wilson column.

R. R. UM STIO
In Quandary on Interpretation
of 8-Hour Law.
Ripley Declares Even Lawyers
Can't Untangle It.
Chicago, Nov. 3. E. P. Ripley, pres
ident of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa
Fe railway, addressing members of the
City club here today, let it be known
that the legal talent of the railroads
are still In a quandary as to what the
roads should do with regard to the
Adamson law.
"Nobody knows what the Adamson
law means or how it can be applied
to existing conditions." said Mr. Rip
ley. "Nobody pretends to construe it
and the best legal opinion is to the
effect that it cannot be construed to
be a legal and binding statute. This
means that if the railroads tried to
enforce it as it reads, there would be
a strike because it would seriously re
duce the earnings of a large part of
the best and highest paid men. If,
on the other hand, the railroads fol
low the law as the brotherhoods would
like to have them do, namely, taking
the hot end of the poker in every case,
it would cost them a very large sum,
estimated at 3100,000.000 a year.-
"No one can tell what the outcome
will be. The law will be tested and
less modified by an act of congress
before Its effective date."
