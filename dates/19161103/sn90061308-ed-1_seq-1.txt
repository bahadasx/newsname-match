speech before the Jefferson City

viewpoint of an American citizen of
German parentage and antecedents.
He predicted Wilson's re-election.

three times, and now I am-ready to1
cast my vote for the man who has
given the country the greatest con
structive administration it has ever
had.
"The country wants peace, and T
believe Wilson will keep us at peace
with the rest of the world."

In our last write-up we stated that
there had been six wolves killed on
the Prairie this fall. . Now that Is no
wolf story to what happened ' a few
weeks ago. Wolves had become very
numerous on the ndrth side. Mr. Poe,
the blacksmith, bagged five at one
shot, that is, he killed the mother and
caught her four pups. A gang had
been seen in and arounehthe old West
fsllca ranch so there was a big drive
set for Saturday night. Some parties
came out from town bringing their
dogs. These dogs were registered to
chase wolves only. They all met at
Carter's store and a captain was
chosen for his strong voice. Tlie or
ders were to carry no fire arms for
fear you might mistake your neigh
bor for a wolf. With clubs they
marched, down to a forty acre
covered with timber and tall grass
and surrounded it. With the signal
the captain commanded them to move
in, then the battle was on. The dogs
inside soon struck a hot trail. The
rrjen were to beat the brush and hol-
low so they could tell which one of
the boys they were in the dark. Over

tree tops and wire fences every thing
gave way under the pressure, each
man anxious to bag a wolf for him

had four jack rabbits and two cotton
tails. Thus ended one of the most ex
citing wolf hunts since Father King
discovered Kings Prairie. The pack
of wolves that had been In Kiere got

A FORD BLOW AT "BOOZE"
Prohibition Won't Hurt Business, Hia
Assertion . : , '
Detroit, Mich., Oct. 31. Irf a state-
I ment today Henry Ford said the re-
port that prohibition will throw; thou-
! sands of men out of employment is an
absolute misstatement.
"I think all the breweries, and the
brewery plants themselves, can be
turned to good uses," Mr. Ford said.
"I have given a year to studying the
plan of using denatured alcohol for
power in motor cars, and other en
gines, and know that the fuel alcohol
can be produced from food products
to turn it over to brewery owners or
others and help save them from loss
in case prohibition comes.
"Understand me, it is aemonstrated
that the denatured alcohol, always
unfit for drink, can be extracted from
the food product and still leave the
grain unimpaired for,food purposes."
