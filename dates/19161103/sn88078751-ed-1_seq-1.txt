any maassa patriot jtfio does that
men who, in the 'midst of ; tho' most'
critical relationships, ,tho' details' of
which" 'they do not know, mako play
with the loss of lives of American, cit
izens even, in .order that they may
create a, domestic political advan

"Thcro are a great many social
QuostI6ns now with whlch legislation
has to deal, very profound and ratflcal
questions. Tbdro ar6 quegtloni of Jus
tice, there are questions' even of moral
health. One of, tho thjmra that Amer
ica Is beInnfng tp perceive is that a
court of law, for example is not neces
sarily a court of Justice, , I say tills
with all formal respect for a; profes
sion which I long ago left, tho profes
sion of the law. What I mean Is this'
Law too seldom has any heart in it,
top seldom has any bowels of compas
sion, too seldom has any quick sympa
thies of perception.
"There aro things that wo ought to
Fee to that we have not been scolng
to tho health, tho moral opportunity,
the Just treatment, the neighborly re
lationships of men of all sorts and
classes and conditions. I tell you,
my fellow-citizens, until a political
party or any other group of men get
that thought at their hearts, thoy are
unfit for the national confidence."'

Wilson's administration than In
any single presidential term in
. .the nation's history.
"We believe that with hts re
election this service: to the cause
of agriculture will be continued
with unceasing strength, Insuring
a continuation of the prosperity
which has come to the nation
since President Wilson entered
the White House.
"The farmers' legislative pro
gram, adopted In the conventions
of the Grange, the Farmers' Un

acted into law by President Wil
son and the Democratic congress.

ANCE. "ABOVE ALL, WILSON HAS
KEPT US OUT OF WAR.
"There Is no means of judging
the future except by assessing the
past. Constructive action must
be weighed against destructive
comment and reaction. This Is
the true test. The record of
great service to the farmer and
the nation of President Wilson Is
our sure guarantee of even great

Jos. R. Wilson
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR
SECOND TERM FOR
Commissioner
OF KNOX COUNTY ON THE RE
PUBLICAN TICKET
Mr. Wilson is a farmer and resides
at Fredericktown. He Is at the pres
ent time serving his nrst term as one
of our County Commissioners, and his
past record shows that he is a man of
good Judgment, honest and upright in.
his dealings with county legislation.
Mr. Wilson's past experience in con
nection with tho recent now road law
which is in operation at the present
time, wquld bo of great value to tho
citizens and taxpayers or Knox county
as a member of the coming new board
of Commissioners, and a vote cast for
him on Nov. 7th will never be regret
ted. (Political Advertisement)
There ore those who think one terra:
of two years Is enough tor Jim Cor;
others who think one term is enough,
ior Frank B. Willfax Ex-President
Taft was limited to one term, and aa
effort is being made to limit Woodrow
Wilson to ne term of four years.
Pomereno may be succeeded by Her
rick, and so it goes.
When a County Auditor, County
Treasurer, Clerk of Courts, Sheriff and
other two-term men nave served four
years, all agree that they have had
enough, and they don't ask for any
more. In view of thess facts, why isn't
one term of four years enough for
Philip L. Wilkins, at a salary of
$2,500.00 per year?
Remember.-
No man has ever been elected to ar
"second term" of four years In the
Probata Office of Kr.ax County, and
that one term of four years Is all T. JU
Remington Is asking for.
