NUMBER IS
HOW YOU GET SICK
Sometime! you overload your
stomach with rloh foods. Your
life may be an aotlve one, and thus
you may care for all you eat. But
a few days of Inactivity show your
system does not call for ao much.
You awake in the morning tired.
Your body feels heavy; you know
you are not up to the mark. Your
digestion has not cared for the
everload. Part of It remains. It
fenerates ft as that inflames the
ellcate linings. They fail to pour
out the digestive fluids and neglect
to absorb the life-giving elements.
You know something la wrong.
Your body gets Weak, and soon
opportunity ia offered for some se
vere nines.
Taken In time, the Indigestion
would not become serious. First re
move the overload: then soothe the
sore membranes; then build up the
weakened body. If s simple to say,
butnottooeasy to do. Youneedhelp.
- A tonlo that will quicken diges
tion, help remove waste, soothe the
soreness and arouse the system
that's Just what you need.
Peruna has an enviable record In
this respect. It has aided many
thousands in the last century to
overcome just these conditions, and
thereby prevent serious sickness.

' Mr. Sims filled his appointment Sat
urday to a rather small audience.
He gave a foil account of his steward
ship, and the reasons why he should.
be returned to Congress. During the
. week he made several speeches in the
county. ,
Monday's Speaking
1 Ex-Gov. Hooper's managers crossed
his wires Monday. He was bille! for
Selmer and Dyersburg and filled his
older appointment at the latter place.
Yandall Hauo,' of Memphis, filled his
appointment here.
I A packed courthouse was Interests
ed and edified by the splendid speech
of Mr. Haun. He is not a political
spellbinder, but rather a close reasoner
as a lawyer. He, however, handled
the issues and candidates in no un
certain manner. The audience Rave
him marked attention during his one
and one-half hours' address. He was
congratulated by a large' element of
republicans who had puntuated by
applause the strong points in hia
speech V; Yandell is a live wire, and ia
not slow to give the reasons for his
political faith, !", i,

iWe have been waiting for some
abler pen to chronicle the wonderful
growth made in Purdy by the efforts
of our energetic preacher, Rev. C. N.
Ralston, and his able assistants. '
We have a fine Sunday school every
Sunday and preaching every second
and fourth Sunday, . and our day
school ia growing rapidly under the
" efficient instructors we have. Mr.
George Ralston U the ' Dean of the
force, having been with us from the
first, while our pleasant, affable Miss
Mary McDermott and the strong per
sonality of -Rev J. B. Butler have
been with '. us now for the second
year, and "last but by no means least"
is our latest recruit. .Miss Ruth Tur-

lady, teaches the yotfnger, element

. Bible study forms the first one in
the morning, and, the children show
a decided interest in it. - Then Ve

There have been several new cottages
built, one of which is owned by Mrs.

Buck Snort
Tells of Grated Corn Bread
Sallie, whur's that ole tin grltter? Corn's a-glttln good and hard,
And I bung that grltter sommers in some outhouse in the yard.
Hunt It up while I'm a-glttln ears ol corn that's fit to grit,
Then we'll have gome old-time hoe-cake find some dodgers made of it.
Doq't I love that gritted corn-bread halnt I gritted many a hour '
J 1st to taste that bread that's sweeter than was ever made from Hour!
There's a softness nnd a richness and the very soul(of corn
In the way that Sallie bakes it, and it's good, as shore's your born.
. '
But as good us Sallie makes it, mammy made it better still,
Fer she bad a old-time oven, and you may say what you will,
Never was a stove invented that could bake a bread so sweet,
Whether It was a corn-meal dodger, or the best of harvent wheat. '
"Buck, go out and git some oak bark; you can find it on the fence."
I (0, them days of mother's cookin, appetite and innocence!;
Rub-a-dub, iny pappy gritted; soon, the dough was made, and hid
In the oven, with coals beneath it, and with coals upon the lid.
If the Lord had ever called me to the head of this here State,
And I should have been respected with the greatest of the great,
I'd come back to ole McXalry, jist to rest my weary head
And to eat a smokln dodger of the old-time gritted bread!

work for the good of the church, Sun
day and day schools.
We had an enrollment last winter
of 123, with an average attendance
of 90 children. We started with
about 40 this fall, but more are com
ing in now, and we will soon have as
many if not more than last year.
Mrs. Hattie E. Marshall.
Editor Independent: ; 1 '
If you will give me space in your
paper, I would like to write a few
lines relative to our schools of Mc
Nairy county with special reference
to the financial condition.
I have been teaching in this county
for twenty years and served as mem
ber of the County Board four years
and am personally acquainted with
most of the teachers. .
Now with due respect to all, are
wa progressing or are we" retrograd
ing? ' ' ;
' I must say, our teaching force is
not what it was twenty years ago
and the interest is not as good; great
er interest was manifested in the In
stitute then than is at present.
' We had educational meetings at
different places over the county,
which were well attended by the
patrons and their " children; fine
speeches were made and freely dis
cussed in the presence of all; beauti
ful songs were sung and the children
would recite and old people wonld
take part, and in this way good was
accomplished and all were encouraged
and inspired. Now our institutes are
all at Selmer, fivith no patrons or
pupils present, and very few teachers,
and the result is, very little is accom
plished. " U : ; ''.' .; - ' (
Most all of the experienced teach
ers have quit teaching and those who
still teach make it a Bide line to farm
ing, and are men of such good credit
that they can wait twelve whole
months or discount their warrants 10
per cent. V'.".'.. '"
: I have gone to institutes and on
passing the office of Trustee, see
young teachers in there pleading for
enough money to pay their board bills,
while we older teachers who are able
and not too lazy to work were turned
away with good grace. '," .
-Another thing that is not right;
The experienced teachers are crowded
frum other districts while the other
teacher drags along with a few, in
sweet anticipation of the last day.
Our county is building iron bridges
and fine roads, which is good, and the
companies who build those" bridges
are more able to wait for their money
than the teacher; they are paid and
the teacher must wait ,
How I do hope to see conditions
change! when the teacher can be
paid when school is out and inferior
teacher thrown out, and we can see a
greater interest in education; our
county will then be made better and
our citizenship greatly improved.
There is no class of people paid
less in proportion to the amount of
good accomplished than the teacher,
and yet it is through his wise man
agement that our county and states
have achieved their greatness.

To The Voters ol The 26th Sena
torial District
I am a candidate for State Senator
from this district. It has been my
intention to visit the various counties
of the district and meet the people,
but have been prevented from doing
so, for the reason I have been attend
log f ederal uourt at JN asn vine as a
witness for the government, and have
just been released, but too late to
make any semblance of a canvass of
the district, and as much as I person
ally regret it, it could not be avoided,
and I hope my friends will only work
the harder.
I stand squarely tart the temperance
laws now on our statutes, and if
elected will take no backward step
along this line, and will vote for any
additional legislation necessary to
make thoroughly effective our laws
we now have. I have been lined up
with those who believed that state
wide prohibition was right. I am
still for that principle, and I respect
fully solicit the vote and influence of
all the voters regardless of what their
politics may be, and in conclusion, if
elected, I assure the people that they
will never have occasion to reproach
themselves for having supported me
in this contest.
, Respectfully yours, ,

The Greatest Insectieide
In a plea for the bobwhite, W, L.
Nelson, Assistant Secretary of the
Board of Agriculture, Btates that a
count of the seed in - one bird's crop
reveals the presence of about 10,000
pig-weed seed, and bobwhites are
known to eat at , least 85 kinds of
weed seed. For meat he chooses
among 67 kinds of beetles, 27 . kinds
of bugs, 9 kinds of grasshoppers, 13
kinds of caterpillars and a variety of
ants, flies and wagpa. One bobwhite
has been known to eat as many as
5,000 plant lice.in two hours, and he
is fond of boll-weevils, chinch bugs,
cabbage worms, cucumber beetles,
squash bugs, army worms and Hessian
flies."; : : - 'j :
And yet there are farmers who are
willing to have all the bobwhites on
their farms killed. Shooting ' the
hired man would be more logical.
The hired man demands wages, while
the bobwhite works for nothing. ;
