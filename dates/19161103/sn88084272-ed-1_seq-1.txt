FRENCH RESTORE VERDUN
Says the Santa Fe Lawyers
Don't Know What To Do
With Adamson Measure.
Chicago. HL. Nov. 3. E. P. Ripley,
president Jf the Atchison. Topeka and
Santa Fe railroad, addressing members
or the City club here today, let It be
known that the legal talent of the
railroad still is in a quandary as to
what the road should do with regard
to the Adamson law.
"Nobody knows what the Adans.m
law means, or how it can be applied
to existing conditions," said Mr. Rip
ley. "The best legal opinion is that
it cannot be construed to be a legal
and binding statute. This means that
if the railroads tried to enforce It as
it stands there would be a strike, be
cause it would seriously reduce the
earnings of a large part of the highest
paid men.
"If. on the other hand, the railroads
follow the law as the brotherhoods
would like to have them do. namely,
taking the hot end of the poker in
every case, it would cost them a very
large sum. estimated at $166,606,666 a
year. The law wjll be tested and prob
ably will find itself in the supreme
court of the United States unless modi
fied by congress before its effective
date."

A Here in the national capitals
interest In the contest be
tween Hughes and Wilson is shared
with the absorblns question. What will
be the political complexion of the next
congress?
It Is universally recognized that an
i executive, either of a state or of the

out his program with his legislature
hostile. Indeed, public business suffers
and frightful deadlocks are almost in
evitable whenever such a situation
comes up

Under the constitutional amendment
proclaimed May 31. 1915. the direct elec
tion of senators was put in force
throughout the union.
lng for elections and some of them are
putting through almost as hard a cam
palgn as Justice Hughes or president
Wilson. For instance. Atlee Pomerene.
senator from Ohio, is faced by Myron
T. Herrick. former governor of that
state and former ambassador to France,
who was one of the men considered for
the Republican presidential nomination
at Chicago. In Wisconsin William F.
Wolfe Is engaged in a rough and tum
ble tussle with "Battling Bob," senator
Robert M. La Follette. who is running
on the Republican ticket, but is opposing-
several Republican national policies.
Every state also has interesting con
tests for posts as representatives, ex
cept In the Solid South, where the only
fight is at the primaries, which are
now disposed of.
Women Voters a Problem.
One puzzling factor in the present
election campaign Is the large number
of women voters. How they will go Is
hard to predict and politicians are wary
of discussing what this new element
will do.
The states in which women can vote
for president and the number of women
in each state over 21 years of age. ac
cording to the last census, that of 1910,
are as follows:
