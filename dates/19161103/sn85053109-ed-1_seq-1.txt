CUT BANK, TETON COUNTY. MONTANA, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1916.
Two Dollars Per Year
Pioneer Citizen is
Suddenly Called
Charles N. Thomas Dies
at His Home After
Brief Illness
Charles N. Thomas, one of
the real pioneers of this sec
tion of Montana, died at his
home here Wednesday eve
ning about nine o'clock, after a
brief illness.
The people of Cut Bank were
deeply moved on learning of
Mr. Thomas' sudden death.
Expressions of sincere sorrow
were heard on all sides and fel
low citizens who had known
him intimately for years joined
in paying him tribute, for his
amiable manner, his never
failing optimism and great gen
erosity. He had the rare gift
of meeting and mixing with all
classes of people. There was
no better known man in all
northern Montana than "Char
ley" Thomas and all were his
well wishers.
Deceased came to Montana
from Canada and saw the state
in the frontier days. He served
on the mounted police force
when the commerce between
Fort Benton and Fort McLeod
was carried on by bull teams,
and Indians and road agents
were a constant menace. Later
he engaged in the stock busi
ness and about twenty years
ago came to Cut Bank to make
his home. For years he has
served as United States Com
missioner and also as justice of
the peace of this precinct. He
was a candidate for reelection
as justice of the peace on the
republican ticket.
Mr. Thomas was affiliated
with many secret societies.
He was a 32nd degree Mason, a
member of the Butte Consis
tory, the Algeria Shrine at
Helena, the Cut Bank Blue
Lodge, an Elk, an Oddfel
low and a member of the O. E.
S.. of Cut Bank.
The funeral will be held on
Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock
and v ill be under the auspices
of the Cut Bank Masonic order.
The remains are now in charge
of Undertaker Bomboy, at the
Masonic rooms in the Halvor
son Block.
A Fuel Famine
The situation in Northern
Montana, on the Great North
ern Railway, relative to scar
city of coal and general conges
tion of business, appears very
serious. Many towns complain
that they are out of coal and
dealers are unable to secure de
livery on shipments. Elevators
are not furnished cars and gen
eral business is congested.
This committee will hold a
hearing in Great Falls, on Nov
ember 1st, to determine what
should be done to relieve the
situation. The attendance of
all persons interested is urged
to testify relating to conditions.
Persons unable to attend should
prepare statements detailing
conditions relative to furnish
ing cars for wheat and other
movements. Coal dealers
should make statements of ton
nage ordered and not delivered
when and from where ordered,
amount on hand and the time
in transit of coal delivered dur
ing October, and from where
shipped. Also give monthly
consumption in ton« for your
community during fall and win
ter months. Give any other in
formation pertinent to condi
tions.
Send all mail addressed Board
of Railroad Commissioners, to
Park Hotel, Great Falls, Mon
tana.
Highline Best of
All, He says
The highline section of Mon
tana. or more properly speak
ing, the country between Havre
and Cut Bank is the most pros
perous part of the Northwest
today" said a representative of
the Aultman-Taylor company
to the writer, last Saturday.
"I was through the Dakotas
on a collecting trip this fall and
found that part of the west as
dead as a maggot. The crops
scarcely paid for the handling
and collections are very poor.
Arriving in Montana I was
thrilled by the great hustle and
bustle and it grew in intensity
as I came west. At Havre
there was the greatest activity
and in all the towns along the
high line between Havre and
Cut Bank the wonderful pros
perity prevails. The hotels are
full of farmers who are hauling
in grain and it is almost impos
sible to secure lodging for the
night in any of these towns.
The stores are doing a big busi
ness, long trains of wagons la
den with golden wheat stand in
line at the elevators, waiting
for the busy wheat buyer to
call "next." The banks are
bulging with money and all
lines of business are prosperous
to a high degree. I was at
Sweet Grass last week and
heard reports of remarkable
yields in that section. The
Sweet Grass country is very
prosperous. »
Of course Cut Bank is al
ways prosperous and lively, but
it seems exceptionally so at
this time. I cannot see a sin
gle reason why the town should
not grow rapidly and why farm
lands around here should not
jump up to $50.00 or more an
acre before very long.
That Copper Tax
Mayor S. L. Potter: "To me
the most astounding conces
sion to special privilege that
the country witnessed in years
was the elimination of the cop
per tax by the chiefs of the
democratic party and the tax
ing of things that places a bur
den upon the wage earners and
farmers of the country. Before
this happened I felt at times in
clined to speak well of the
president and his administra
tion, but this surrender to the
copper barons of Butte and
Wall Street was too much for
me.
"And more astounding is the
silence of the daily press of
Montana concerning this act of
the administration. Democratic
and Republican alike, the daily
press of the state is singularly
silent on the matter. It con
vinces me more than ever that
our Montana daily papers are
shamefully subservient to the
copper crowd of Butte and New
York.
"Why should copper have es
caped the 'war tax' and neces
sities be taxed? If some one
will venture even the feeblest
explanation I shall be grateful
"This might serve as a reason
Not long ago Senator W. A
Clark, head of the powerful
Amalgamated, declared he
would refuse to support the
head of the ticket if this tax
provision was retained. Soon
after that the tax went off ar.d
the Butte Miner and other lac
keys of the daily press started
whooping it up for the ticket.
"Why did Senator Myers and
the two democratic congress
men vote for the striking out of
the copper tax proviso? That
is something no one seems pre
pared to explain."
Sheriffs Office Should
Be Held Responsible
Cities Have Little Authority in the
Matter of Abating Gambling
Nuisance
Three weeks ago the Con
rad Independent made the
statement editorially that
Sheriff Billy Miller had
"stopped gambling in every
nook and corner of the
county." It further stated
that "the saloons are fighting
Billy Miller because he has
suppressed gambling" or
words to that effect. The
Pioneer Press at once took
issue with the Independent
on the question raised. It
asked for specific proof as to
time and place when and
where gambling had been
stopped, as to time and place
when and where an attempt
had been made to stop gamb
ling. It asserted that no at
tempt had been made to
stop gambling in Cut Bank,
by the sheriff's office. Edi
tor Busey has not attempted
to furnish specific proof to
support his statement. He
cannot do so.
The Pioneer Press repeats
that no attempt has been
made to stop gambling by
the sheriff's office in Cut
Bank. It repeats the state
ment that the sheriff's office
has done nothing here to
help improve moral condi
tions. It asserts that the
statement that the saloons
are fighting Billy Miller is a
"stall," since the Sheriff's
deputy holds a half interest
in a saloon license.
But, says a local apologist
for the sheriff's dereliction,
the mayor of the town
should suppress gambling,
not the sheriff's office. Let
us consider the law and the
fact:
In 1901, the legislative as
sembly of this state passed a
law making gambling a felony.
Felonies can only be persecuted
in the district, courts. The en
tire machinery of the law of
persecuting gamblers was thus
put in the hands of sheriffs,
county attorneys and judges of
the district court, under the
general supervision of the gov
ernor and attorney general. If
there was gambling in any city
or county the above mentioned
authorities were primarily re
sponsible for that condition and
for all violations of the law.
Thus the whole machinery
for handling the gambling evil
was placed in the hands of
state and county authorities.
We have had democratic gov
ernors ever since the law was
passed. During much of the
same time there have been
democratic attorneys general,
democratic judges and demo
cratic county attorneys and
sheriffs. Even when there were
republicans in the latter offices
the chief executive of state
was charged by law to see that
the anti-gambling existed in
Helena, as elsewhere, it was
primarily due to the negligence,
disobedience to law and indif
ference of the democratic gov
ernors and other county and
state officials, charged espec
ially by statute with the en
forcement of law in case of all
felonies.
Cities and city officials could
only have a minor part in en
forcing the anti-gambling stat
ute. All they could do was to
arrest offenders and turn them
over to the county and state
authorities. And the sheriff
and constables had like author
ity and power to make arrests.
In another anti-gambling stat
ute, enacted a few years later,
cities were expressly forbidden
to pass "anv ordinance regard
ing gambling or gambling
houses" and "all ordinances and
parts of ordinances of cities and
towns in this state regarding
gambling and gambling houses
shall be inoperative and void."
This statute took entire juris
diction of the gambling regu
lations out of the hands of cities
and placed exclusive jurisdic
tion of the subject under county
and state authorities. The
power to make arrest was joint
ly given to county and police
peace officers. The power to
prosecute and punish were ex
clusively matters of state and
county authority.

Robert Has Lost
His Flax Halo!
Robert Paul, Flax King of
1&15, seems to have lost his
halo.
A report was received in Cut
Bank last week to the effect
that John Hall, the well known
Red River rancher bad broken
the world record set by Robert
Paul last year, by threshing a
field of flax that yielded 38
bushels to the acre. The Pioneer
Press did not publish the re
port, for the reason that no
verification could be secured.
Now comes the Sweet Grass
Advocate, giving details of the
yield. It states that the field
that produced the world-rec
ord crop was measured by a
surveyor and the exact yield is
sworn to by Thos. Halvorson.
who threshed the crop, and
Kenneth Luke, cashier of the
International Bank, who saw
the field measured. A report
of the yield was wired to Boze
man College and a reply came
that this was the highest yield
ever recorded in Montana or
any part of the United Spates.
Last fall the manager of the
Sherwin Williams Paint Com
pany wrote the Pioneer Press
a lengthy letter concerning con
ditions in the flax zone of the
Northwest, and declaring that
northern Teton county was the
linest. flax region in North
America. He stated that the
Robert Paul yield was the big
gest he. had ever heard of. He
concluded his letter with the
statement that "the section of
Teton county contiguous to the
mountains from Choteau to
Cut Bank is the finest flax
zone in America.
Taft's Name on Ticket
Local citizens have prevailed up
on Robert L. Taft to permit Iiis
name to be placed on the republi
can ticket as a candidate for Justice
of the Peace, to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of Charles N.
Thomas. Mr. Taft is a very busy
man at all times, attending to the
affairs of the Firat National, but
agreed to till the place for a brief
time. Electors will please remem
ber that R. L. Taft and Frank E.
VanDemark are the candidates for
justice of the peace of Cut Bank
Township.
Lee Barrington underwent an
operation last evening, ly Drs.
Nelson of Cut Bank and Powers of
Conrad, for internal injuries sus
tained by a fall, at his ranch early
yesterday morning. Mr. Barring
ton's condition is satisfactory at
this time.
The grade teachers in the local
school attended teachers' institute
at Choteau this week.
All Praise Spirit
of Local School
Capacity House Enjoys
Entertainment At
Assembly
Interest in school affairs here
was never so great as at the
present time. The enthusiasm
of the teach3rs and pupils is
radiating to all parts of the dis
trict and everyone is catching
the contagion. Evidence that
the enthusiasm "disease" is be
ing communicated far and wide
could be seen in the attendance
at the entertainment at the as
sembly room of the high school,
last Saturday evening. The
assembly hall was packed long
before the time set for staging
the different numbers and the
rendition of the program was
received with keen pleasure.
Each of the rooms was repre
sented on the program. First
came the little tots in Miss
Waldron's room, with an imita
tion "square dance," in which
the young gallants evinced
much chivalry and courtesy in
the presence of their "young
lady" partners. The number
provoked much merriment.
The other grades in order up to
the high school had numbers
that were highly entertaining.
The high school pupils acquitted
themselves very creditably in
several "stunts" and closed the
program with a rollicking Ger
man
After the formal program
had closed there was a rush for
the peanut-and-candy and cake
and-coffee booths and the merry
rattle of silver made one think
of the counting room in a met
ropolitan bank. Dancing fol
lowed and all enjoyed the time
actively on the dancing floor or
in social conversation until
"twelve bells."
The receipts were very grati
fying. The funds above ex
pense will be used to defray
the expense of some high school
gill who will be selected to at
tend the Avocation Congress at
Bozeman later in the year, as
explained by Principal Fair
brother.
