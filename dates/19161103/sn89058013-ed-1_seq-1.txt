Inasmuch as God has blessed us
with a new lease of health and
strength let everyone who can con-
veniently do so attend regularly
and use your influence to get oth-
' era to come with you.
The first reason we assign why
the great and grand work of build
ing the spiritual temple of Clod,
evangelizing the world, conveying
the glad gospel tidings of mercy
ana salvation to precious souls wno
dwell in the regions of the shadow
of death should not cease, is be
cause of its moral grandure.
Every work of God is grand in
itself. Wherever we look out upon
the face of nature we behold the
wonders of his hand or the impress
of his feet. The earth displays his
greatness, goodness and power.
The heavens reflect his glory and
the firmament showeth his handi
work. Who can lift his eyes up
ward toward the skies and behold
the star-studded heavens without
exclaiming, "How manifold and
glorious are all thy works, O Lord
God Almighty?'
Yet there is a scene still more
. xvnuvku-J v - ' - -
sublime to mankind than these a
subject much more closely con
nected with his well-being; not of
secondary, but of the most mo
mentous consequences to him in
time and eternity, aud that is the
wonderful spiritual work of God,
the gracious plan of salvation.
The saving of souls, the redeem
ing of a lost and ruined world, is
the most exalted and greatest of all
the divine work. As such it occu
pies a preeminence in the sacred
volume, and God is represented as
being especially interested in it.
It is the work of his Omnipotent
Arm, the overflowing of his loving,
rompassiouate heart..
There seems to have been but
the exertion of his voice and the
vast UU1VBIBO wuu an no ouuiimo
Iwauties came into existence, but
to save men to redeem a fallen
snd ruined world there were
councils, covenants, dispensations,
promises, oaths and blood. There
v;,is the robbing of heaven of its
brightest jewel, Jesus Chriat, the
ily begotten Son of God, who
imate down from the Celeetia
world of glory, lived among inenr
taught them tlie way of life, and
thou spilled his blood upon he
j ugged Cross of Calvary as nn
ittoueuient for men's sins. Heaven
uuited with earth, divinity united
with humanity.
This work deeply interests and
ovrerfu!ly agitates tlir-e. wot Ida.

"HE HAS KEPT
This if the face of a man strong, courageous,
patient and kindly, a man
Always alert to the aspirations of his fellow
man and sympathetic toward their fulfillment;
Never complacent toward the encroachments
of privilege nor tolerant of social wrong;
Always seeking to enhance the dignity of
labor and better the state of the toiler;
Never lending an ear to the sophistry of ex
ploitation or the blandishments of expediency;
Always patient to hear and weigh, to ap
praise and analyze, and passionate to find the
way of right;
Never premature in purpose nor prejudiced
in judgment, and never headlong in decision
Such is WOODROW WILSON.
It is a work which includes all
time and equally all eternity.
Surely such a work should not
cease, it should not cease because
of its gracious character.
We might well assent to the
cessation of the display of mere
power. We should rejoice in the
cessation of exhibitions of judg
ment aud wrath. We hail the
subsiding of the waters of the del
uge;, we hail the termination of the
plagues of Egypt ; we hail the
ceasing of the howling storm, the
rumblings of the earthquake, the
descent of the firey lava as it
bursts forth from the burning
mountain, dealing death and de
struction to all in its path.
We rejoice when the sword of
war finds its peaceful scabbard and
rapine, no longer rages to consume
humanity like a blighting plague.
But the work of God is one of
grace of favor to guilty man,
compassion to the ungodly and of
mercy to the wretched culprit of
US OUT OF WAR"
rebellion. This work announces
eyesight to the blind, health to the
diseased, liberty to the captive,
riches to the poor, joy and peace
to the mourner, salvation to the
lost and Heaven to the guilty.
God might have withholden
every bounty from man, who had
of his own free will devolved from
God and transgressed his holy,
justand righteous laws laws made
for man's own good but with his
great, loving, compassionate heart
bubbling over with love and mercy
he graciously compassionated his
rebellious children and provisioned
the way -whereby the prodigal
might return unto his father's
house and there dwell again in
dignity and honor.
Gracious, gracious work. Surely
such a work should not cease so
long as one poor prodigal', is fam
ishing out in the dreary desert of
sin and shame. Surely there flows
from the heart of every returned
and reinstated prodigal such a
thankful spirit as will lead them to
gladly respond to the loving Fath
er's calL for help to extend his
gracious work of mercy and salva
tion, with the declaration, "Here
am I, send me,"
TT
uere is my Heart, Here is my
tongue, here are my hands, here are
my feet, here is my all; take me
use me . whenever, wherever and
however thou seeth best. I was a
self-made, ruined and lost prodi
gal, but thou received me dirty
and wretched as I was back into
thy favor and gave again unto me
my former place of honor.

DEMOCRATS TO
HOLD RALLY
Jackson, Tenn., October 28
Sounding a bugle call for the great
Tennessee rally of Democrats to
be held in Jackson Monday, the
Jackson Sun will say editorially
Sunday morning:
"West Tennessee is a Gibraltar
of Democracy. Madison is a Dem
ocratic couuty . Jackson is a hot
bed of Democratic activity. There
is no doubt how West Tennessee
aud Madison County and the city
of Jackson will go iu the election
of November 7, but there is a chal
lenge to the Democrats of this sec
tion to do more than they have
ever before done for their party
aud the candidates of their party.
"No glory is to be gained here
by giving a bare majority to Wilson
and liye and McKellar and all the
other Democratic candidates. They
have a right to expect that and
more. Their services for the peo
ple and the record of their party
demand not merely a majority but
a tremeudous outpouring of votes
to express in the onlv wav it is
)ossible to express the thankful
ness of this nation for the peace,
prosperity and social justice that
have been made possible by exer-
m . m
else ot the creat nnncio es of .
Jeffersoniau Democracy.
"Tomorrow Jacklon will be the
Mecca of West Tennessee Demo
crats who will assemble here to
assay their strength and analyze
their organization for getting out a
full vote on election day.
"Governor Eye will be here and
he will make a speech that will
ring with the confidence of a man
who has kept the faith.
"K. D. McKellar will be here
and he will speak for the cause of
the National ticket and all that a
Democratic Congress has done and
can do for the American people.
"Senator Lee is coming to add
his influence to the organization of
the last week's campaign in West
Tennessee, B. A. Enloe, Finis
Garrett, L. D.. Hill, Mann Wills
and other old war horses of De
mocracy are going to participate in
the great pow-wow. . Aud all of
this activity will not be unneces
sary, for the Eepublicans in West
Tennessee are not sleeping. Fol
low their gum shoe trails and they
will be found leading to all of the
lairs from which it is possible for
them to secure recruits. They are
organized as never before. Not a
stone has been left unturned aud
no detail of campaigning has been
neglected. All of their voters are
registered and have poll tax re
ceipts in their pocket. They are
being inst ructed iu the marking of
the ballot and will not fail to vote.
"So let the Democratic rally of
tomorrow be such a demonstration
of unity and determination to strike
with all the force of patriotic en
thusiasm that the whole western
division of the State will be per
meated with a fervent desire, a
restless determination to make the
majorities of Wilson aud Eye and
McKellar aud all the other Demo
cratic candidates a high record
mark on the tables of election
statistics."
