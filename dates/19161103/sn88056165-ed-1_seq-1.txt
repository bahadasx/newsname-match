GRAVE QUESTIONS
CONFRONT VOTERS
Action Next Tuesday May
Have Far Reaching Effect
In Time to Come—Ma>
Mean Peace or War.
Only a few more days until
election and, while the larger
part of the voters of the country
have undoubtedly made up their
minds as to how they intend t(
vote for state and county candi
dates, it may be well to call
again to mind some of the gt ave
matters concerning the nation
and the future welfare and pros
perity of her people and give
them serious thought before cast
ing our ballots next Tuesday for
the candidates for president.
While the great drift of popu
lar support throughout the coun
try has been going to Woodrow
Wilson and has been growing
stronger as time passes, as is ev
idenced by the numerous straw
ballots taken in all parts of the
country and by the many reports
of old time republicans who have
publicly announced their inten
tion of supporting the president
for re-election, there are others
who find serious fault with the
president and condemn him for
various reasons. One of these
complaints is against his stand
on the munitions question, the
objection having been raised that
our nation should have remained
strictly neutral and that muni
tions of war should not have
been sold to the warring nations.
There are sound reasons for not
holding with this contention; and
Mr, Hughes in his speech at Co
lumbus, Indiana, on Tuesday of
this week, when asked whether
he, if elected, would favor or op
pose the placing of an embargo
on munition shipments or the
passage of a "war resolution"
warning Americans not to travel
on merchant vessels of beligger
ents, stated:
"I am in favor of the mainte
nance of every right, including
the right of travel and the right
of shipment."
From this statement it would
seem that those opposing Wilson
on these questions can expect no
better treatment at the hands of
Mr. Hughes.
Among the important matters,
however, which the citizens of
our country should carefully con
sider before going to the polls is
the success or failure of the
many excellent laws enacted by
the present administration dur
ing the past four years. Among
these measures are the federal
reserve banking law, the income
and inheritance tax law, the
child labor law, and that greatest
of all measures—the rural credits
law. The first will do away
with all future money panics; the
last will save the farmers of our
nation a hundred and fifty mill
ions of dollars each year in in
terest alone, besides insuring
them money in future at not to
exceed 4i per cent and on loans
of from five to thirty-five years.
These laws are all for the benefit
of the farmer and laboring class
of our people and not for the rich
element. They are still in their
infancy and some of them have
not yet been placed in active op
eration, yet all are considered by
the bright minds of our country
to be important, beneficial acts
of constructive legislation. If
President Wilson is returned to
office again next Tuesday, within
the next four years these laws
will all have been placed in op
eration and will have become
known throughout the land. If
they are found satisfactory the
people will not allow them to be
f
is
is
a
repealed. Should Hughea be |
elected, however, these measures
may be repealed before they
have 1 een giv^n an opportunity
of proving their gjeat value t>
the nation and"our people will
again be sold back into bondage
f o Wall Streit. Hughes is a
vVall Street man and has been
Vom the start. He is now being
tacked by the big interests who
ire moving Heaven and earth to
lect him. Should he go into the
Vhite House he will become a
ool to do their bidding, and this
ddding will be in favor of the
ilutocratic element and against
he common people.
Do you want to play into the
tands of Wall Street, dear read
r?
Can you afford to take chances
f losing the great acts of bene
icial legislation that have been
lassed for the benefit of your
elf and your neighbor? Have
ou any assurance that your spe
:ial grievance will receive any
letter treatment with Hughes in
he chair than under Wilson?
Instead of munitions going across
he waters do you wish the
young men of the nation going
dong to use them, and peihaps
against those you hold dear?
These are momentous ques
tions and should be cbnsidered
most carefully before your vote
is cast next Tuesday. On your
decision may rest the peace
and prosperity of the nation for
years to come, for one false step
at a critical time often means de
struction. Why not leave well
enohgh alone.
Sheep Travel in Style
Purebred livestock has come to
be recognized as being so impor
tant an adjunct to successful
farming within recent years that
nothing in the way of good treat
ment is too fine for them and it
is no uncommon occurence to see
them traveling around the coun
try in automobiles the same as
well to do citizens. J. B. Luchte
feld, who owns and operates a
fine farm north of town, recently
purchased nineteen head of pure
bred Shropshire sheep from a
shipment of 190 head that had
been received at Grangeville from
a prominent breeder near Boise.
The sheep were received here
Tuesday morning and were load
ed onto Fat Hamlin's auto truck
and hauled out to their new
home, the fine leader of the
flock being transported in state
by himself in the owner's car.
The sheep are some of the best in
the state and were purchased by
several of the leading farmers
and stockmen of the county who
will use them to improve the
standard of the flocks through
out the county.
Mr. Luchtefeld is adopting the
proper method in putting in a
nice flock on his farm, for they
will not only pay a handsome
profit in wool and mutton and for
sale as breeding stock, but will
be invaluable in keeping down
the growth of weeds on the farm
and converting otherwise worth
less pasturage into the cheapest
meat on the market. «
R. A. Nims was a county seat
visitor yesterday.
Dr. Orr reports the birth of a
babv girl to Mr. and Mrs. Ray
mond Créa southeast of town
Wednesday morning.
Dan W. Greenburg, editor of
the Moscow Star Mirror, was in
town for a short time yesterday
afttrnoon on his way to Grange
ville. He had just returned from
a trip to the southern part of the
state and said things were look
ing fine down that way for both
Wilson and Alexander and in
fact for the entire ticket. He
predicts the election of E. L.
Parker by a large majority.
