Train and Engine Crews Exam­
ined Last Evening— Dead
Were Lehr People
Fred Lefferinan of Lehr was fatally
injured and his wife instantly killed
at 2.41 yesterday afternoon, when
Northern Pacific train No. 7, steaming
at. a rate of forty miles an hour,
struck their car on the Apple Creek
crossing, east of this city. The car
was hurled a hundred feet from the
track, both of the passengers being
ejected in mid-air. The body of Mrs.
Lefferinan fell 93 feet from the cross­
ing, while Mr. Lefferinan, in a dying
condition, was picked up almost 100
feet from the scene of the collision.
Debris from the wrecked car was scat­
tered over an area of 150 feet.
Lefferman Died Enroute.
Engineer J. F. Kellum, who was at
the throttle, applied the air immed­
iately the crash came, stopping his
train within its own length, and im­
mediately backing up to the crossing
The train crew found that Mrs. Leffer­
man was dead, and her body was not
disturbed, pending the arrival of the
coroner. Mr. Lefferman, however, was
still gasping, and, according to one of
the witnesses, had sufficient strength
left to swallow a few drops of water
offered him. He was placed in the
baggage car, and No. 7 proceeded to
Bismarck. At Pierce, Conductor G. E.
Williams of Fargo, in charge of the
train, found the injured man still
alive. His death occurred somewhere
between that point and the Soo cross­
ing in Bismarck, where the conductor
again visited the baggage car and
found life extinct.
Stalled Engine-Side Curtains.
No real light on the cause of the
accident was shed by the inquest
which Coroner Anton Beer conducted
at Lucas' chapel last evening. The
testimony of Engineer J. F. Kellum
and Fireman C. L. Jahnke of James­
town, Conductor G. E. Williams of
Fargo and Mrs. Nick Bohn. who re­
sides in the section house at Apple
Creek, all tended to show that an
abundance of warning signals had
been given by the oncoming train, al­
though a very few seconds elapsed
from the time the curve east of the
station at Apple Creek was rounded
until the crash occurred. Engineer
Kellum and Fireman Jahnke were
certain that when they reached the
straight piece of track extending
about 1,000 feet east from the crossing
the latter was clear. The engineer
testified that he gave the usual four
blasts of his whistle three times in
traversing this thousand feet. The
fireman stated that he looked out
from his position at the left side of
the cab when the engine struck the
straight-away and that no automobile
or other obstruction was in sight. The
fireman then descended to the deck of
the locomtive to attend to his fires,
and knew nothing of the crash until
the engineer cried, "We've hit an
automobile!" Engineer Kellum stated
that the automobile did not become
visible to him until a second before
the engine struck it, and then he saw
only a small portion of the front end
of the machine.
Eye Witness Talks.
Mrs. Nick Bohn was at the front win­
dow of the section house waiting for
the train to pass when she first saw
the automobile half a mile away. It
attracted her attention as it came oyer
the hill east of the crossing traveling
at a snail's pace, and the danger of
the car's being struck immediately oc­
curred to her. The car had proceeded
to a point where it was concealed by
the loading platform, at the south side
of the track, near the crossing, wheD
ihe train rounded the curve. She saw
the automobile struck. The car, she
testified last night, was overturned,
throwing the occupants out. It did
not appear to her that the machine
was thrown into the air or projected
any distance. The engine, she stated,
struck the rear end of the machine.
State's Attorney Berndt called the at­
tention of the witness to the fact that
the car was found some distance from
the crossing, which fact did not tally
with her statement that the machine
was immediately overturned. Engin­
eer Kellum explained this apparent
discrepancy by stating that the hub
of the car caught under the pilot of
bis engine, and that it was carried a

Collision Off Eastern Point
Avoided by Hair's Breadth
-When Submarine Arrived
MISTAKE IN READING
CODE SIGNALS CAUSE
New London, Conn., Nov. 2.—When
the German undersea freighter,
Deutschland, approached here at mid­
night, Tuesday, the United States
government dredger, Atlantic, narrow­
ly escaped running her down, it was
learned tonight. According to the
Atlantic's skipper, the near accident
was due to a mistake in reading tho
code signal lights. The dredger,
which was off Eastern Point, made
out the lights of the submersible,
which was coming nearly head on.
The Atlantic kept its course, expect­
ing the Deutschland to steer outside.
When she did not, the Atlantic swerv­
ed to one side and slowed her en­
gines, passing the Deutschland with
about 100 yards to spare.
Manifest is Filed.
The manifest of the Deutschland's
cargo was filed at the custom housg
here late today, and it will not be
made public for some time, the offi­
cials of the Eastern Forwarding com
pany said. Unloading began this af­
ternoon.
German Attache Goes Aboard.
Dr. George Ahrens, an attache of
the German embassy at Washington,
spent considerable time with Captain
Koonig on the Deutschland today and
received five pouches filled with mail
and a box. Questioned as to whether
the Deutschland would carry mail
back to Germany, he said: '"Why
should she carry United States mail
over? If the United States can't get
mail to Germany, it is time to stop."
Germany Has Lost 20 Submarines.
German submarines have been caught

EASY TO KEEP OUT OF
WAR NOW, SAYS CANDIDATE
Asserts Executive Is Guardian of
National Honor and Must
Use Discretion
Albany, N. Y., Nov. 2.—Charles 15.
Hughes, speaking here tonight, declar­
ed his belief that ho would win the
electoral vote of Ohio, lndhn.1 and
New York, and asserted he was "look­
ing forward to the responsibilities of
administration," outlining what he re­
garded as the "essential conditions oi
national leadership."
No Apologies to Make.
Mr. Hughes addressed an audience
t: at waited nearly throe hours to hear
him. He was introduced by William
Barnes, former Republican state
chairman. The nominee, in previous
speeches today, had declared he had
no apologies to make for his attacks
on the administration for its foreign
policies, which he had characterized
as "very cruel and unwarrantable,"
that a vote for hini meant a vote for
war, and he declared his opposition to
"muddle and meddle" in America's
foreign relations.
Executive is Guardian.
"The executive is the guardian of
the national honor," Mr. Hughes de­
clared. "He has a very wide discre­
tion in the management of our foreign
relations.. He has his own judgment
almost exclusively as his guide, and
he is not supposed to exercise that
judgment except in conformity to :he
well established principles of inter­
national law.
Must Retain Respect.
"It is not a whimsy he should con­
sider it is not a loose generality, a
conceived service to humanity that
should engage his attention. It is
his duty to have his country adopt
and follow correct princip'e of in­
ternational action, recognized by the
nations of the world, and thus main­
tain the respect to which we are en­
titled and giving up an opportunity
to have a growing interest through
that esteem by which, indeed, we can
maintain our rights and in the end
truly serve humanity."
Replies to Wilson's Statement.
Mr. Hughes replied to a statement
in a recent speech of President Wil­
son's, as follows:
"It is not that we should be truc­
ulent. it is not that we should go
about with any braggart assertion of
power. It is not that we should en­
gage in bluster. I like the phrase,
'the peace of a gentleman,' but tuc
peace of a gentleman is unafraid,
alert, in his self-respect, and getting
his rights, quietly and calmly, ready
to maintain them. That is the peace
of a gentleman."
Easy to Keep Out of War.
In his speech here tonight, as in
other speeches during the day, Mr.
Hughes declared that "there never
has been a time, perhaps, in our his­
tory when it was easier to keep the
nation out of war than during the
past few years, when every nation
engaged in the great strife abroad
desired our friendsship and would not
by reason of any assertion of our
just rights, forfeit that friendship."
Delayed by Street Parade.
The nominee was an hour late in
reaching Albany. His address here
was further delayed by a street par­
ade, many blocks long, which he head­
ed. On his way to the hall, the nom­
inee was cheered by crowds on the
sidewalk.
"I come to you after several days of
a very remarkable experience in the
states of Ohio and Indiana," Mr.
Hughes said. "I suppose that no can­
didate for the presidency ever receiv­
ed a more generous greeting than I
received in these states.

Officials Discredit Rumors of

El Paso, Texas, Nov. 2.—A message
received by Americans here, from
Chihuahua City, reported that Parral
had been taken by Villa troops. This
town was given as Villa's objective
when the bandit moved south from
Santa Ysabel.
Nine Americans at Parral.
As far as known here, there are
only nine Americans employed at
Parral and in the Parral district at
the present time. These are: T. C.
Hawkins, A. W. iMorris, Leslie Webb,
and Howard Gray, all of whom are
employed by the Alvarado Mining and
Milling company W. E. Halmer, Dr.
J. Flannigan, W. E. Co
well,
O. B.
Smith, and another American, whose
name is unknown. Four of these men
are employed at other mines in the
Parral district and Dr. Flannigan is a
practicing physician in Parral, accord­
ing to Americans who formerly lived
there.
Parral is 54 miles southwest of Jim
inez, Chihuahua, and 1H miles in a
straight line south of Chihuahua City.
Consul Denies Report.
Carranza Consul Fravo denied that
'Parral had been taken. He said Gen.
Luis Herrera had a garrison of 2,000
men in Parral, well supplied with am­

American mining men who have

TRIBUNE RETURNS
TO MAKE BIG HIT
The complete returns which the
Tribune has promised to throw on
a screen in front of the Grand Pa­
cific hotel next Tuesday evening,
election night, Will make a big hit.
The size of the crowds which may
be anticipated for this evening are
indicated by the fact that yester­
day the Ladies' Guild of the 8t.
George's Episcopal church decided
to serve a hot lunch on Fourth
street, adjoining the Tribune,
from 8 o'clock until after midnight
on the seventh. The hundreds
who will await the final returns
may refresh the inner man with­
out missing a single bulletin, and
the ladies expect a liberal patron­
age as a reward for their enter­
prise.
BIG LANTERN PROCURED
Through the courteous co-opera­
tion of Superintendent Martin and
Principal Bolt, the Tribune has
procured the big projecting lan­
tern of the Bismarck high school
for use in flashing the returns on
the screen, and the machine was
set up yesterday in Linde A Mur­
phy's offices, which have been
kindly loaned for the occasion and
all advance preparations have
been made.
EARLY RETURNS AT 8:30.
Early returns from scattering
districts in the east may be ex­
pected by 8:30 o'clock next Tues­
day evening. There is an hour's
difference in time, and the faet
that voting machines are used in
many eastern states, giving im­
mediate totals is a further advan­
tage in Bismarck's favor.
MUCH INTEREST SHOWN.
In spite of the apathy apparent
in the early stages of the cam­
paign, more interest is now appar­
ent than has been known since
Bryan's famous race. The contest
within the state for justice of the
supreme court and for state treas­
urer also will be watched very
closely. The Tribune's plans for
procuring state returns insure ear­
ly advice on the United States
aenatorship and all other counts
in North Dakota.

FOR ALLEGED REMARKS
Roosevelt Registers Protest
Against President's Misuse of
the Militia
Cleveland, O., Nov. 2.—Attacking
President Wilson's attitude toward
Mexico, and scoring the president's re­
cent Buffalo address, Theodore Roose­
velt tonight addressed an overflow
meeting, speaking from the city hall
steps to a crowd which jammed East
Sixth street.
Greeted With Bedlam of Cheers.
Roosevelt arrived here at 7:30
o'clock, and was escorted to the Arm­
ory by a large torch light parade. The
streets were crowded with spectators,
who cheered the former president.
Former Senator Thomas E. Burton,
former Governor Post of Porto Rico,
and Mayor Harry Davis preceded
Roosevelt on the program.
Roosevelt referred scathingly to the
alleged remarks of Secretary of War
Baker concerning the soldiers in
Washington's army and told the big
audience he was glad to present his
plea for support for Charles E.
Hughes. In referring to President
Wilson's Buffalo address and the Dem­
ocratic administration's attitude to­
ward Mexico, he said:
Protests Against Misuse of Militia.
"I want to register my protest
against Mr. Wilson's misuse of the
militia, and the diplomatic service for
partisan advantage. If the president
says we are in ignorance of our for­
eign relations, he is bound to enlight
en us. If he doesn't tell us now, there
must be some reason for It.
Question President's Phraseology.
"He says: 'We are not afraid
fight for something as big as an Amer­
ican ideal.' What does that mean?
Does it mean he wouldn't fight for a
murdered baby? There were 103 ba­
bies on board the Lusitania. Is there
anything bigger in American ideals.
He sent Boyd and Adair into Mexico
and left them. He would not back
them up.
"What does Mr. Wilson mean by be­
ing bigger than American ideals?
What can be bigger than protecting
men and women, born under the
American flag, or naturalized under
it?" Mr. Roosevelt left after the
meeting for the east.

Fargo, N. 1).. Nov. 2.—Pointing to
the prospect of restricted production
because of the farm labor shortage,
W. R. Porter, superintendent of the
demonstration farms in North Dakota,
declares the railroads must take cog­
nizance of the ever increasing serious
labor situation, if they would bring
about the proper development of the
northwestern states.
That the Industrial Workers of the
World, through their campaign of ter
rorization, directed against honest
wage earners who make their way in­
to the northwest each year in search
of work in the harvest fields, have
raised a barrier between the more de­
sirable laborers who ordinarily would
come to the northwest, and the far­
mers of this region, is a feature that
Mr. Porter maintains must be taken
into consideration in dealing with the
subject.
A solution of the problem, proposed
by Mr. Porter, is the adoption of the
plan employed in Canada, where the
railroads operate labor specials—car­
rying laborers from the eastern cen­
ters to the prairies of the west, at
extremely low fare—the rate being
only
$10 from Toronto and other east­
ern centers, to points in Manitoba, Al­
berta and Saskatchewan.

in the sinking, apparently without
warning, of the British freighter, Ma­

lives, is not expected by the state de­

and he would not be leaving Wasing
ton if anything final were expected
immediately, and that at least a week
was expected to elapse before full
evidence would be at hand.
Action Will Be Delayed.
Even though all information desir­
ed from British sources and American
survivors of the Marina were at hand,
any action by the United States gov­
ernment would be delayed pending
Germany's reply to the informal re­
quest for her version of the incident.

Secretary Lansing made a state­

the state department held that Ger­
many's pledges not to sink merchant
ships without proper provision for
the safety of persons on board, ap­
plied to merchantmen armed for de­
fense as well as the unarmed vessels.
Germany's last specific word on arm­
ed ships, however, was her memoran­
dum announcing that they would be
treated as war vessels, and the fact
that the Marina carried a 4.7-inch
gun is expected to play a conspicu­
ous part in the exchanges that will
follow, if it is established that she
was attacked without warning.
