Berlin, Nov. 8.—Secretary Joseph C.
Grew, of the American embassy, who
is acting as charge in the absence of
Ambassador Gerard, was instructed to
day tv aak the German government for
information in.regard to-the sinking of.
the British -steamer Rowanmore off
Cape Clear, on Oct. 28. No instruc
tions have been received regarding the
case «f the British steamer Marina.
[It was said in Washington on Tues
day that the American embassy in
Berlin had been, asked .to make inquiry
regarding the sinking by submsfrlnes.
of the Marina and the Rowanmore.
None of the Americans on the
Rowanmore was lost. The latest in
formation regarding the Marina is that
six of the flftyotwo Americans on
board were drowned.]
time was given an explanation of the
withdrawal.
Forts Douaumont and Vaux, it was
explained, formed such a material
element in the defense of yerdun as
long as they remained with unimpaired
armament in French hancls that they
had to be put out of action in order to
cripple the fortress, and once this was
accomplished the ruins of the forts,
with the armaments removed, possessed
no such Importance to the Germans,
and served chiefly as targets for the
French artillery.
Now "that Fort Douaumont had
passed again into French possession
Fort Vaux no longer, in the opinion
of the German leaders, justified the
heavy sacrifices necessary to \retain
the ground about the fort,, which is
ill-adapted to defense against attacks
from the south and west.
Fort Vaux, therefore, was aban
doned and ithe German iineB retired
to positions less exposed to the
Blench artillery.

Scores Democratic Party
For Failure to Reduce
High Cost of Living.
ry"
CANT BE DONE ,'-C
Fails to Produce Revenue.
Hudson, 'N. Y., Nov. 3.—?In his speech
here today Charles E. Hughes ma^
the tariff his chief theme and assailed
the democratic party for its failure to
reduce the high cost of living.
"I think they were just as eloquent
in -promises four years ago as they are
today," Mr. Hughes said, "as I look
back to the statements Chey made with
respect to what was going to be done
for labor. They promised an entirely
new condition in which, labor would
profit to {he utmost and American bus.
iness would get an extraordinary in
centive.
"They told us, for example, that
there waa the high vurt of living, Well,
we all know that. We have an inti
mate knowledge of that fact. But,
what is more to the point, they told us
they were going to reduce it. Well,
thru a division our ranks, wthich I
am glad to say has been happily heal
ed, the}* had a chance to show what
they could do with this high cost of
living. That robust companion, how
ever, has becomw more and more ro
bust and it is mounting higher and
higher ,and when we consider this
promise In relation to present prom
ises we wonder whether, they are go
ing to do any better with respect to
the future.
What Really Happened.
""While they did not reduce, the cost
of living, they were eminently success
ful in reducing the changes of ^taking
a living. They did not promise jthat
they promised quite the contrary. They
had a wonderful prqgrani they.were
going to reduce the .qost of living
they were going to provide for the ex
penses of the government thru their
tariff system they were going.to in
crease the opportunities for business
and they were going to have Amerlc&n
enterpriser®* they said, take on a ne#
/slse and speed.
"Well, they put their .principles in
force. Thejrhad not had^a chance to
do it for a great many years. They
proceeded with extraordinary results.
In the flirst place they had a tariff f?r
.revenue only, but it did "not produce
'revenue. Wp had a falling off fn rev
enue, thru a tariff for revenue, and we
had a great increase in imparts.' They
had to pass what is called a war rev
enue bill to take care of the deficit
which was the result of. their flgoaj
policy.
"Then they said they were going to
have American enterprise take on a
new size and speed, and it did, a much
reduced'size and a* much slower speed.
The opportunities of labor vanished, or
were greatly reduced, and we had a
very extraordinary condition In this
country."

America efficient," used by Mr.

Both the old parties, he said, know

"The way to make America efficient
to compete in the markets of the world

New York, Nov. 3.—One thousand,
eight' hundred twenty merchant ships,
with an: aggregate gross tonnage of
3,328,5^4, have %jven sunk by belliger
ent nations rdttring twenty-seven
months of war etoding Nov. 1, accord
ing to figures cocfaijfflled from cable dis
patches and mail advices, published
here today by the Journal of Com
merce.
The losses durlAg October were larg
er than any one of the preceding five
months, amounting to 121 vespels of a
total of 227,11* tons gross. The Octo
ber rate of destruction was consider
ably in excess of the monthly average
thruout the war period and British
shiplng sustained losses nearly equal
to those of August and September
combined. Norway lost the largest
number of ships—fifty-six—but their
gross tannage was' only 58,388, as com
pared to Great Britain's total loss of
1&5,646 grosji tonhage of thirty-eight
vessels destroyed.
A table showing the total shipping
losses sin$e_jUie war began estimates
those of the~entente allies at about 78
per cent and those of the neutrals at
18 per cent, with- Teuton-lc loss less
than 7 per cent.

company should pay the plaintiff In
compensation $260 and as punitory
damages $3,000. It la expected that
the company will appeal and the case
will be the first one of the kind to be
carried to the supreme court of Wis

dressed to the Milwaukee Free Press
and the messages were copied In the
Milwaukee office of the compapy and
delivered simultaneously to the Free
Press and the Milwaukee Journal, ap
pearing in the same editions of both
papers.
The attorneys for the defendant
company admitted a willingness to
confess judgment In the amount of ac
tual damages suffered by the plaintiff
in the duplication of the ^newspaper
copy. The attorneys, however1, Ijel^
the company could not be held for the
acts of Its agent jmd be foreed to pay
punitory damages.
Judge E.- B. Belden held, newspaper,
copy Is as much entitled to the confi
dential consideration of-the tMSgr&pli
company aB any other kind of mes
sages filed with the oompany. He hefd
the duty of the company was to trans
mit these messages without disclosing
their contents and that if the jury
found the messages had been trans
mitted to more than one newspaper it
could assess punitory damages. The
members of the Jury ranged in this es
timate of punitory damages from
$1,000 to $10,000.
ADAMSON LAW IS
NOT UNDERSTOOD
Existing Conditions Road Officer
Deolares Application Means Strike.
Chicago, Nov. 3.—E. P. Ripley, pres
ident of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa
a ad ad re of
City Club here today, let It be known
that the legal talent of the railroads
are still In a quandary as to what the
roads should do with regard to the
Adamson law.
"Nobody knows what the Adamson
law means, or how it can be applied to
existing conditions," said Mr. Ripley,
"The best legal opinion Is that It cai
not be considered as a legal and bind
ing statute. This means thnt If the
railroads tried to enforce It as It
stands there would be a strike, because
It would seriously reduce the earnings
of a large part of the highest priced
men/ If. on the other hand, the rail
road? would follow the law as the
brotherhoods would like them to do,
am el a in of
poker In every case, It would coat
them a very large sum, estimated at
$100,000,000 a year. This law will be
tested and probably will find Itself ID
the supreme court of the United States
unless modified by congress before its
effective date."
