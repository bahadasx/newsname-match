Mr. Charles E. Hughes in his
upeech at i'hilmlelphia stated his in
Urnauonal policy as follows:
"We uo not propose to tolerate any
improper interference with American
commerce, with American mails, or
with legitimate . commercial inter
course. vVe do not propose to toler
ate that any American who is exer
cising only American rights shall be
put on any blacklist by any foreign
nation. We pVopose to protect
American lives, American property
and American trade, according to our
just rights under international law."
And 1 say in Philadelphia what 1
said in Milwaukee, that we haw no
il.trigues, no unstated purposes, no
secret understandings. We stand for
the interests of the United States, and
its interests alone, four-square to the
world, first, last and all the time."
The election of a Republican Senate
and House of Representatives-is of
vital importance to every American
citizen who agrees with the forego
ing policy and with the other policies
of government administration held by
Mr. Hughes and incorporated in the
platform of the Republican party.
Without a Republican Congress, Mr.
hutches as president would be Un
able to carry out his policies. This
makes important the election of ex-governor
Myron T. Herrick for United
State Senator. Mr Herrick's name
is a household word in Objo and no
stronger or more able man for the
U. S. Senate; no man better equipped
by training, experience and natural
strength of character and ability can
be found in any State in the Unifln
than Mr. Herrick -
Hon. Nelson E. Matthews the Re
publican candidate for re-election as
Representative frorh this, Fifth Con
gressional district has, during his
' first term in that office demonstrated
his aijjlityas a legislator and his fidelity
to the interests of his constituency.
He stands squarely for the very poli
cies for which Mr. Hughes and the Re
publican party stand, "America first
and efficient." He realizes that the
overwhelming issues before the coun
try are the protection of American in
dustry at home and the maintenance
of the dignity and prestige of the na
tion nhroad and adequate protection
the lives and property of its citi
zens wherever in the course of legiti
mate travel nnd business they may
frn n the civilized world.
Mr. Matthews is a man of. known in
tegrity, of sterling character and test
ed ability, he deserves the support of
every citizen in this congressional dis
trict. The same conditions which obtain
in regard to the national Republican
ticket hold also as regards the Re
publican State and County tickets,
r iank H. Willis as Governor of Ohio
has steadlusuy devoted his efforts
to ledeeming the Republican platform
edges of 1914 and in spite of de
termined and persistent obstruction of
..e Cox political machine he has suc
jocded beyond the expectations of his
most sanquine supporters during his
iiist campaign. He has accomplished
material economy and increased effi
ciency in the management of State
affairs. The records show large sav
ings in almost every 'department as
compared with 1914 and at the same
time a vastly increased volume of
work more efficiently accomplished.
In order that this work in the inter
ests of all the citizens may be continu
ed it is not only necessary that Gov
ernor Willis be re-elected but it is
essential that his cabinet of State of
ficers and the members of the Gen
eral Assembly shall be men who will
work in harmony with Mr Willis
along the lines of State government
to which he and the Republican party
of the State are pledged. John H.
Arnold, candidate for re-election as
Lieutenant Governor has proven his
worth bv the splendid record he has
made during his first term in that of
fice. Charles Q. Hildebrant the pres
ent Secretary of State also a candi
date for re-election and deserving it,
served as a representative in Congress
from the 7th Ohio district from 1901
to 1905, he was a delegate to the Na
tional ReDublican Convention in Chi
cago and voted for, the nomination of
Charles E riugnes ana nanes w.
Fairbanks. Attorney General- Ed
ward C. Turner, another candidate for
re-election has made a record during
the eighteen months of his adminis
tration that ought to secure the
unanimous vote of the State for his
re-election: He has reduced the ran
nine1 exnenses of his department al
most S5.000 per month or more than
$85,000, in the first eighteen months
and at the same time ne accompusnea
a srreatlv increased volume of bust
ness. Purine the eighteen months
ending June 30th, 1916. Mr Turner
rollected and covered into the State
Treasury the sum of $589,067.40 in
sums ranging from 8c upward. This
is the largest sum of money from the
largest number of persons ever collect
ed by the department during a similar
period of time and would have been
sufficient to have paid all the ex
penses of the department during that'
period. i

SENATOR m C. CUSS
Candidate for- State Senator for Sec
ond Term. v
Work well done should always be
rewarded- Senate Bill Nc. J.25 ' is
the reason C. C Cass, of Ottawa, Re
publican candidate for re-election to
the Senate from the bdrd district,
should be returned to finish the great
public service he has begun and for
which he ha3 a ifar-reaching vision.
When Senator Cass went to the
upper branch of the Ohio General
Assembly he had a definite purpose.
He promised 'himself and his consti
tuents that he would do one big thing
and do it well. Senate Bill No- 125
tells the story of how well he kept
this pledge No sooner did he take
his seat than he was recognized as
one of the leaders. He was made
chairman of the committee on public
highways and in two weeks- Senate
Bill No. 125 was introduced. Senator
Cass ably defended it on the floor,
soon it was passed and the biggest
step to "Lift Ohio Out of the Mud
was taken-
The Putman senator was bom in
the country and all his business asso
ciations have been such as to make
him conversant; with the needs of
the farmer and the needs of his city
brother. He studied their cases
carefully. He looked into the dusty
tomes of the state and found what
road laws already existed. He swept
the cob webs away, , he brought out
and sorted them then bringing his
knowledge of the needs of Ohio into
piay, prepared Senate Bill No. 125
it became a law tne nrsu ox issi. ocy,
tember. . ,
t. rocc1 lpo-islat.ive record
aside from his work in benalt ot
good roads stamps him as tne aa
lhlic servant, the
public servant with high ideals- with
broad outlook, the courage of' his
convictions and unswerving honesty.
Principle and never politics determin
ed his stand on all questions He
was never led astray in any legisla
tive matters. He was right on all
moral and temperance questions. He
is a positive man. You always know
where he stands- ' It is the duty of
the 33rd district to the entire to
state to return Senator Cass by an
over-whelming majority. Political Adv

EVERETT E.
Candidate for County Commissioner
from Dover Township.
E. E. Spring of Dover township is
one of the Republican Candidates for
County Commissioner. He is one of
the foremost farmers of the county
and his farm speaks in loudest praise
of his business ability, thrift and
good judgment.
Mr- Spring has spent his entire life
in this county and is familiar with the
county's needs as to roads, bridges,
ditches and business management As
his farm management shows he is a
man of splendid judgment.. He is
cautious, prudent and fearless in fol
lowing his convictions.
He served as the assessor of real
estate in his own township and so well
was his work done in the most diffi
cult position that the County Board
of Equalization did not add to or take
from his returns, a single dollar. The
records in the County Auditor's office
show that his report stands unchang
ed. This is 'only another testimonial
of his honesty, good judgment, busi
ness ability and fearlessness in. the
discharge of a public duty-
If elected, those who know him
best, believe that he will make the
county a commissioner second to
none His friends, Republicans and
Democrats alike, are asking you, Mr.
Voter, to put a cross in front of his
name on the official ballot on election
day, believing, that by so doing, you
have made a wise selection for this
important office. Political Adv't

: A reduction of the state tax levy
would take away the appropriation
for the maintenance of the school-"
Democratic Expositor. Gov Cox re
duced the common school tax $2,000,
000.00 annually. If Gov. Willis should
reduce the state. levy in this particu
lar, it would only reduce the revenue
for the support of the common schools
1396,000.00 annually If Gov. Willis
takes away the support of the com
mon schools by reducing the revenue
1396,000.00, what did Gov. Cox do
when he took away from the common
schools $2,000,000.00 annually? Willis
has cut out -useless jobs and reduced
extravagant salaries to make up all
he takes from the school fund- . The
public schools now receive from the
general revenue fund of the state
nearly all the money the state con
tributes to their support, and a re
duction of the levy means-only tak
ing this reduction from the general
fund. The. schools will receive their
support as usuaL

pense of appointing a referee in the
transfer of a saloon license at Arch-v
bold? You now say that saloon keep
er is alright. Was it Jim Pilliod of
i Toledo that wanted to control the
saloon business of this county?
If Senator Pomerene had recom

Postmaster of -Wauseon, would he be
now whooping it up for Pomerene as
he is. for Cox, who made him Liquor
