Columbia, Mo., Nov. 3. The Long
horns of Texas and the Tigers of Mis
souri will meet In a football game on
Rollins Field here tomorrow that
promises to be the banner game on
the Missourlans' ground for the 1916
season. In anticipation of It the date
has been called "Home Coming Day"
for former university students and
graduates and expectations today
were that hundreds of them would fill
the stands when the referee's whistle
blows for the opening kick-off tomor
row. Neither team will go into the fray
certain of success, as comparative
scores of the two teams, playing to
morrow for the first time In almost 15
years, Indicate the squads almost
equal In scoring ability. The Texans
this year scored three touchdowns on
Oklahoma while the Tigers piled up
a similar number of touchdowns and
one field goal on the name team. But
the Sooners tallied twice against the
Missourlans and only once against
Van Gent's Southerners, making the
latter, "doping" from the scores, about
three points better than the Missou
rlans. However, Oklahoma's team
was not ao far advanced when it play
ed the Texans and. In addition, the

Coach Van Gent went to Texaa thla

of the Tiger freshmen, and took with
him. as assistant, "Ltx" Clay, who was
