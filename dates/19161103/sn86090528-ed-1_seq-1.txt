RUSHING FOR

the enforcement of the amendment to

"The automobile owners and drivers
are coming in fine now, lie said this

by November V, no driver will be

der the old law are exempt there is
little objection to it. The public is
beginning to see tha the ordinance
was enacted for the good of the people
and for their safety."

IDENTIFIED
BY CREDIT
MAN HERE
Harry Schwarts, of the Hub, Has Known
Mrs. Clark Since She Was a
Little Girl
PRISONER HAS
ALL PRIVILEGES
Is Not Confined in Cell Owing to Danger
of Charge of False Imprisonment
of Babe
Denying that she had passed the
worthless checks but stating that she
had passed through Chickasha less
than threo months ago and had spent
the night hero, Mrs. L. F. Clark, now
In custody of county officers, gave an
interview to a Dally Express reporter
in tho sheriff's office yesterduy after
noon. Tho prisoner with her ten-months-old
babe is given the freedom of the
jail and jailer's and sheriff's officoa.
She spends much time on the groundB
outside the building and Ih being
treated more as a guest than as a pris
on Inmate. Tho reason for this con
sideration Is not a desire to show more
deferenco to Mrs. Clark than to any
other woman prisoner, but rather a
determination not to implicate mat
ters by Imprisoning her babe and thus
probably subject tho sheriff's office to
the charge of false imprisonment.
Therefore, while the reception room
adjoining the sheriff's office had been
prepared for the deserted young wife
it was not used when it was found
that she was Btlll accompanied by her
child.
Mrs. Clark shows no sign of de
pression and Is evidently contented
with her present surroundings. At
night she occupies the jury room which
is not in tho category of a cell and
therefore clears the officers o'f any
suspicion of imp) '.soiling tho child.
Though having been Been but twen
ty summers Mrs. Clark has had an
eventful life. She had worked at Nor
man and Lexington and it was at the
latter place that sho fell In love with
and married a man whom sho had not
known but six weeks and who, accord
ing to her statement, proved to ba a
loafer who could not or would not sup
port her. What ho ever did for a liv
ing Bhe appeared not to know. That
tho officers of tho law are on his trail
for wife desertion and "maybe other
things" she declared to the newsman.
"Does your paper go down into Tex
as?" she asked, "for it it docs maybe
we had better not say anything about
this for he Is down there and he is
smooth in getting away."
The prisoner stated that sho was In
Gainesville, Texas, on October 8, when
she was arrested and brought back to
Pauls Valley to answer to the charge
of passing worthless checks signed by
Mrs. John O'Connor, tho same as were
those wjiich were passed in Chicka-
sha. She gave $1000 bond there, be
lieving that Pauls Valley people sign
ed as sureties though sho expressed
uncertainty on this point as she was
in Norman when she was notified of
her release under bond. After beiug
placed under an additional $1000 bond
here yesterday by Judge Fuller she
told members of the sheriff's force
that the Pauls Valley bond should
servo for both places and that Bhe
should ba released. That she antici
pated early freedom and an early job
was indicated in the interview yester
day when she propounded the query,
"You don't know of anything now, do
you?"
Mrs. Clark's married life was spent
at Lexington and Mayesville.
Mrs. Clark has been identified by
Harry Schwartz, credit man at the
Hub. as the same person who present
ed and passed the checks on Septem
ber 3 at the Hub clothing store. Mr.
Schwarts has known the woman since
she was a child.

BE CAREFUL OF GAS
HEATER ADVISES DIXON
(By Samuel G. Dixon, Pennsylvania
Commissioner of Health.)
This is the season of the year when
many people instead of starting their
furnaces-uso gas stoves to take off the
chill. Not Infrequently they use rub
ber pipe connectiolns and in the ma
jority of cases the stoves are liot con
hoc tod with a flue.
Such an arrangement Is dangerous
In tho extreme. Every year many
deaths are reported as a result of just
such conditions. Coal gas or water
gas contains a largo percentage of
carbon monoxide and this having little
or no perceptible odor may be present
without being noticed. There is no
warning and unless material having an
odor is added to the gas, the victim
becomes unconscious and unless aid
arrives a fatal result is almost certain
to follow.
Do not use a gas stove without flue
connections and proper ventilation.
Gas water heaters are often install
ed in bath rooms without outside con
nections and then there are made use
of to heat tho room.' Such arrange
ments are extremely hazardous.

SOUTH SQUAD
FROZEN BY
REED'S MEN
Chickasha High School Eleven Take Game
From Lawton Usferday by Count
of 20 to Zero
BOTH TEAMS WERE IN
PINK OF CONDITION
Hatchet ol Hard Feelings Buried Between
C1J Tim? Rivals and Clean Game
Was Verdict of .II
Supported hy an aggregation of six
ty rooters and sido lino tans, the Law
ton high school football team urrived
Thursday morning fully endowed with
jazzum and otherwise prepared to ad
minister tho drubbing bo long intended
for tho local bearers of tho pig skin.
And "not alone In mournful numlio'rs"
rame they from the south for such a
vorltablo inundation of bleacher warb
lers has scarcely been seen Blnce
Chickasha high has conteuded for
state championship.
From the time Lawton s aspirants
landed at their destination, Reed's
men fully understood that It was no
trivial or insignificant eleven which
tho referee's whistle would bid them
charge. Indeed if either clan expected
an easy victim as their prey such illus
ions were speedily revealed whn in
the first few minutes play each team
sought vainly for a pregnable spot in
their adversary's line. Battering as
saults In the flrHt quarter proved well
night of as much avail to the crusad
ers of the crimson 'And white as to the
cohorts of C. II. S., and the stronghold
of each underwent a crucial test from
the time the ball was put into play.
Lawton ranks were preceptibly heav
lor than were those of the purple and
gold while from the very beginning
tho latter's speed held the visitors to
a decided disadvantage. No decisive
gains could be made by line plunges
directed against cither stronghold and
the only other alternatives were con
sequently resorted to, viz. end runs
and passes. Trick plays were attempt
ed only occasionally and the game
may properly be said to have fallen
Into the class of "copyrighted" foot
ball, very few sensations being In evi
dence.
Those showing tho greatest dexter
ity among local domons ot tho grid
were C. Goetting, whose long end runs
netted valuable gains for Chickasha,
and the Hills who were always relia
ble for the reception of long passes
or ground gaining short end runs. Rid
dle played a stellar game at the pivot,
never failing In his aerial tackles over
tho enemy's ramparts in spite, of his
almost disqualifying Injuries received
n the Pauls Valley game. Congrat
ulations on a well genera led game aro
due Fox. whose coolly directed plays
from his position at quarterback nev
er miscarried even under strains of
greatest moment. Wilson and Gard
ner at the lino's extremities seemed
magnetic for forward heaves and
bagged much gain thereby. Excessive
praise could scarcely bo given the un
faltering defense maintained by local
guards nor the night Invincible ad
vances of Chickasha tackles. A clean
game would best decide the nature of
the foray directed by an Invading
squad, the objective of which was a
clan for whom, of old, Siiniu animosity
had existed and who, in t,tru, had felt
unkindly toward the other. A very
competent referee was compelled to
make remarkably few - penalizations,
and these only for unintentional In
fraction of rules.
The game was called at 4 p. m. and
hy quarters was as follows:
First Quarter. Lawton kicks oft
and Chickasha fumbles on second
down. A long pass to Chickasha fail
ed as did an attempted long end run.
C. II. S. lost the ball on downs only to
recover it again when Lawton passed
ZCi yards which was tipped into Wil
son's hands. A stubborn resistance
or. part of the visitors held Chickasha
to a punting position and th latter
returned the favor. C. H. S. fumbled
two passes successively and J. B. 11:11
