Road Hogs Must
Be Regulated
The question of what course must
'he pursued in order to make the pub
lic highways ordinarily safe for those
who must use them, has for some time
past been bothering the minds of all
sane and conservative people. The
rapidly increasing number of auto
mobiles to be found on the highways
and byways is forcing this question
to an immediate solution, if the lives
of the populace are to be in any way
safeguarded.
One cannot drive many miles, in
any direction out of Farmington,
without passing scores of automobiles,
and especially true is this on Sundays,
which is the one day of the week
when the greatest percentage of au
tomobile accidents occur. A Sunday
auto trip is all that is necessary to
impress one with the very great im
portance of more drastic laws to curb
the careless joy-riders.
. Such a trip will give one a far kon
ar insight into the characteristics of
the "road hog". Often one of these
animals will be seen coming along the
middle of the road, apparently ob
livious of the fact that there is any
thing ahead of him, and with appar
ently not the slightest intention of
swerving to his own side of the road.
He knows that the sensible driver is
not going to endanger the lives of his
load, as well as his machine, by jam
ming into him, and his selfish instincts
are permitted to run riot while he
monoplizes the middle of the road.
There is a crying need constantly
increasine for road laws that will
insure to all their full rights on the
public highways. To this end the
automobile "road hog" must be
brought into subjection, or else be de
nied the use of the roads. The con
stantly increasing number of vehicles
on the highways makes it necessary
that everv driver must exercise judg
ment, at all times, if accidents are to
be reduced to a minimum. Many arc
nervous now when they start on an
auto ride, which is but natural when
the long list of accidents are noted, es
pecially in the Monday papers. While
others have refuted to make trips
when they believe the highway may
be somewhat crowded with autos.
There is absolutely no place on the
public highway for the '''road hog."
He must be restrained from its use.
There is also another very serious er
ror, sometimes practiced, which should
be punished by a heavy fine, and that
is the running of autos without lights,
after nightfall. Such ,things should
not only be punishable by a heavy
fine, but it should be the duty of all
those who respect the law, to report
every such violation, coming under
their notice.

WOODROW WILSON
President of the United States
J. G. Ballard, Jr., Killed in Accident
John G. Ballard, Jr., store keeper atl
State Hospital No. 4, while returning
from Flat River late last Monday eve
ning in a buggy, was thrown or
knocked out and the side of his head
crushed so that he died from his in
juries Tuesday afternoon between 3
and 4 o'clock.
Just how thc4 accident occurred is
not known. He was driving a livery
horse from Mayberry, Byington &
Tullock's stables that was never known
to shy or scare at automobiles. When !
near Judge Swink's Judge Mayberry
passed him in an automobile and I
spoke to him; the horse was jogging j
along in a slow trot or fast walk. A
tew minutes after Judge Mayberry
passed him, a touring car from the
direction of Flat River whizzed by at
high speed. Whether this machine
struck the buggy and knocked Mr.
Ballard out, or whether the horse be
came frightened and gave the bug
gy a sudden lurch that threw him out,
will probably never be known, as the
driver of the turing car was not rec
ognized by Judge Mayberry as he
passed him, and nobody seems to
know who ho was or whose car ho was
driving. The horse ran with the bug
gy down the rust street intersecting
the. Flat River road, turning south
into C street. Bert Byington saw the
horse coming and dragging the bug-
gy which had been overturned, and
ran out and spoke to the horse, when
the animal immediately stopped.
Marion Counts of Flat River on his
way home from Farmington about 7
o'clock found Mr. Ballard lying un
conscious by the road side near the
home of R. P. Taylor. He ran to the
house and told Mr. Taylor. As they
returned to the road, W. L. Bouchard
editor of the Deslogo Sun, came
along, and the three men car
ried him into the house and tele
phoned for a physician. It was found
that the left side of his head just
above the ear was badly fractured
and crushed an inch or two upward
and lengthwise of the head. He was
taken to the Dr. Watkins Hospital,
where as already stated he died Tues
day afternoon, without ever recover
ing consciousness sufficiently to tell
anything about how the accident oc
curred. His injury was such that the
physicians from the first examination
entertained no hope of his recovery.
Mr. Ballard was aged 52 years, and
he was a man of excellent Christian
character, lovable qualities, and en
joyed the confidence and friendship of
all who knew him. His accident and
death were a great shock to his fam
ily and his many friends throughout
the County. His wife died several
years ago, and he leaves three sons,
three daughters, one brother and one
half brother to mourn his tragic end.
The children are Mrs. Floyd Davis
and Mrs. Thomas W. Byington of
Farmington, James D. Ballard of
Marion, 111., Jefferson and Shaw of
Farmington, and little daughter,
Katherine Elizabeth. His brother.
Dr. J. D. Ballard, lives at Oklahoma
City, and his half brother, J. C. Bal
lard, near LibertyvBe. A wave of
sincere sympathy gles out to them
from all over the county in this great
sorrow that has overwhelmed them.
The funeral was conducted from the
Christian Church Thursday morning
at 10 o'clock, Rev. J. M. Bailey preach
ing the discourse. Interment in Park
view Cemetery.

Instructions
To the Voters
Inasmuch as a great many voters
who are Republicans are asking how
to vote for President Wilson, we deem
it advisable to make the following
suggestions:
If you wish to vote for Woodrow
Wilson for President and use the Re
publican ticket or Socialist ticket, it
will be necessary for you to strike out
the names of the Republican or So
cialist electors, and write in their
stead the names of the Democratic
electors. Therefore we suggest that
you use the Democratic ballot where
the names of the electors are printed,
and then below write in those Repub
lican or Socialist nominees, whom you
desire to vote for. The names of
Woodrow Wilson and Charles E.
Hughes do not appear on the ballot
anywhere and you must vote the
names of the electors, there being 18
in number in the State of Missouri.
We understand that some of our
Republican friends have advised many
of the voters, who formerly voted with
them, that all they have to do is to
write the name of Wilson on the bal
lot and that will assure them of voting
for Wilson. THIS IS NOT TRUE.
THAT WOULD MAKE YOUR BAL
LOT VOID. THE BALLOT WILL
BE THROWN OUT IF YOU WRITE
ANYTHING ON IT EXCEPT THE
NAME OF THE CANDIDATE IN
PLACE OF THE ONE YOU HAVE
STRUCK OUT. The best way to be
safe is to vote on the Democratic
ticket and if you desire to do any
scratching below the electors, strike
out the name of the candidate vou
want to scratch and write in the name
of the man you want to vote for. IF
YOU ARE IN DOUBT BE SURE
TO ASK THE DEMOCRATIC
JUDGE. You have a perfect right
to do this. He will give you the cor
rect information. In this way you
will be sure of casting your ballot for
Woodrow Wilson for President.
Col. Gardner at
Ste. Genevieve
Spurgeon Ditch, Deputy Sheriff
and Watchman at the Federal Lead
Company's plant at Flat River, shot
and killed Tony Donabich, a Hungar
ian, last Monday forenoon about 11
o'clock.
It seems that there was a Hungar
ian wedding or some sort of celebra
tion among the foreigners working
for the Federal, and that Donabich
got into trouble, made an assault on
another Hungarian, and threw rocks
at the house and broke some of the
windows. He ws a big, strapping,
quarrelsome fellow, and had been con
victed along with several others five
or six years ago of an assault to kill
Red Murray, who was then Ma' "
of Rlvermhiwi, all of theru receiving
penitentaaryentences. They were af
terwards paroled.
Last Monday morning Parkhurst
Sleeth sent Deputy Ditch to bring
Donabich to his office at the Federal
works to see him about the damage
he had done to the building the day
before. Ditch went to the store of
Frank Brncie where he found Dona
bich, and vremained there about an
hour and a half drinking sodawater
and bevo and smoking with him and
other foreigners. Ditch told Donan
bich that Mr. Sleeth-wanted to see him
at the office, and Donabich went, out
with him somewhat reluctantly to the
gate (Brncie's place it seems is
fenced in), and stopped there, saying
he would come after while. Ditch
said "you must come now this is the
last time I'm going to tell you." Tes
timony before the Coroner went to
show that Donabich was leaning
against the fence with both elbows
resting on it, when Ditch pulled a
gun from his shirt and fired one shot
into Donabich's brain, who died a few
minutes afterwards before he could
be taken over to town.
Ditch says that Donabich became
"uarrelsome, refused to go with him,
..nd reached for b.'i; un, and it. was
then he fired the shot that did the
deadly work. But there being no
other testimony to sustain his state
ment, the Prosecuting Attorney held
him without bail and had him lodged
in jail to await further proceedings.
A warrant for assault to kill was
sworn out before Squire Martin
against Donabich Monday morning
for the assault he made on another
foreigner the day before, and had been
placed in the hands of Deputy Con
stable Joe Richardson, but had not
been served up to the time Donabich
was killed.
on next Tuesday the old time Demo-!
cratic majority. He cautioned the '
Democrats of Ste. Genevieve county
to look well to their home vote, and i
that he and his St. Louis friends
would attend to the St. Louis vote,
where he expects at least an even
break, even though that city is nor
mally 20,000 Republican.

DISTRICT FEDERATION
Marvin Young is among the Farm
ingtonians who are in the Miami, Ok
lahoma, mineral field this week.
Willard Rariden, Dr. C. A. Tetley,
Francis A. Benham and A. W. Brad
shaw drove over to Ste. Genevieve
Tuesday evening to hear Col. Fred D.
Gardner speak at that place. The
court room was crowded to full ca
pacity with an eager and enthusias
tic assemblage to near Missouri s
next Governor. Col. Gardner sus
tained the splendid reputation he has
made during the present campaign as
a logical and forceful speaker, and
his speech throughout indicated that
sterling business ability which first
brought him into the limelight as a:
candidate for Chief Executive of this
State.
The day had been a strenuous one j
for him, during which he had made :
twelve speeches, beginning in a big j
tent meeting at DeSoto, from which j
place his journey had resembled a
:'i?rmhl mn'i-h with great gath-j
erings at every stopping point who I
had assembled to hear him. But, as
he expressed it, he "still had suffi-1
cient pep to express in most heart-1
felt manner his gratitude tor the non
or that had been done him by that
splend'd gathering.
In his gentlemanly manner he
scored his Republican opponent, Judge
Lamm, severely for his wholesale
misrepresentations of this grand old
State, but excused the old fellow, for
his many shortcomings, on the
grounds that he is now in his dotage,
and that his mind naturally reverts
back to the days of Republican mis-1
rule in Missouri, and he has simn-j
ly "forgotten", or tried to forget,
whirh party it was that held up and
robbed this State.
He explained in sucinct manner the 1
nroposed workings of the Land Bank
bill, which has proved to be so power
ful, especially with the farmers, and
his explanation of its splendid benef- j
icence fully accounts for its great ,
popularity.
In closing, he said that RenubHcans
as well as Progressives appeared to
be Democrats this year; (hit practi
cally all apneare l to be of one ac
cord, and that Missouri would return
