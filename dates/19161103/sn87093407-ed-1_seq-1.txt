■SEATTLE BETTORS BACK WILSON
FINAL DRIVE
OF CAMPAIGN
HERE IS WARM
_ If Mr. and Madame Averag" Voter suffered from
ennui during most of the campaign, they are now sur
feited with excitement, especially in Seattle.
For this city is the political storm center of the
state. Here all camps—republican, democratic, booze
and anti-booze, referendum and anti-referendum, have
determined to make their most desperate "final drives."
Here the last few days are filled with bets, bom
bast and bombs, aerial and oratorical.
The streets were littered with "literature" Friday.
Candidates have begun to speak on street corners, work
shops, and anywhere else thev could get any sort of an
audience. They have even drafted non-candidates into
service. Bands are playing day and night. A fife and
drum corps is working overtime to summon ye voter to
listen to various patriots. Political arguments reach
fever heat at all hours and are illuminated by red-fire
and torchlight processions at night.

THOUSANDS GIVE
WILSON OVA TION
By Robert J. Bender
NEW YORK, Nov. 3.—Thrilled and inspired by New York's
wild welcome yesterday and laet night. President Wilson sailed
from here on the presidential yacht Mayflower today en route to
Shadow Lawn. The president and his advisers believed the greet
ing of the thousands here augured auspiciously for November
7. It was as he himself called it—"a royal welcome."
The city fought, screamed, bellowed, elbowed, stampeded,
roared, jammed and hip-hip-hoorayed its greeting.
Two of the most enormous crowds that ever fought and
cursed their way into Madison Square Garden and Cooper Union
were on hand last night to hear the president on his first campaign
visit here.
The roar and buzz in the garden drowned out the president**
words while a blatant band outside thumped out a tune even
while the president sought to make his voice carry to the 14,000 or
15,000 crammed inside the structure.
Seventy-five thousand was the police estimate of the welcom
