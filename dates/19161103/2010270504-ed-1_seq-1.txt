TO THE VOTERS
(Advertisement)
We, the members of tho North Platto
Volunteer Fire Department, urgently
recommend tho support of tho voters
on Novombor 7th, for Mr. Cy Russoll,
Democratic Candldat6 for Sheriff.
Mr. Russell has an excellent record
as at fireman, being a veteran flro
fighter, having served for seven years
In tho local department from recruit
to Clief, and ho now socks a chance
to render equally s good service to
tho county, nB sheriff, and wo nnd
many 'of his friends declare that his
being placed In office wIR mean a con
tinuation In a largo field of tho excel
lent work dono ns a servant of tho
city. During his soven years ho has
always been at tho call of tho citizens,
of North Platto, alweays ready to an
swer tho alarm bf flro, at any hour of
tho day or night and willing to risk
Hfo and limb for tho protection of
their pro'perty. ' ,
On two occasions ho supported tho
present sheriff and was ono of his most
persistent workers In his bohalf, but
now, Mr. Russoll and his friends feol
that five years in office Is a sufficient
length, of tlmo for ono man to hold of
fice, no mntter how efficient ho may
bo. Ho 13 nol discrediting tho work
done by tho man now in office and Js
nlwaysready to commend tho efficient
service hq has rondorcd Ho Is, how
over, quoting tho wordB of his op
ponent when ho was seoldng his first
term In office: "Tho other fellow has
been in office long onough. If tho of
flco is a good thing, it is only fair to
pass it around. If it isn't a good thing
there is no use killing a good man by
burdening him with it too long."
All Mr. Russell wants Is a chanco
to make good In this offices as ho has
in other things ho has attempted. If
you wll glvo him a chancp, your vote
will bo greatly appreciated,
