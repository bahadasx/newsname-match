tee voted $50 and this money was used
for the purchase of the explosive, the
police said. Harrison is the local's
business agent, Herlihy its financial
secretary and Murne its general secre
tary, the police asserted.
Captain Tunney said the fSO was
part of the collections which strikers
have. been taking up in the streets
when they appeared with hand organs
and applied for funds. In this way
the appropriation was kept off the

FATHER OF FIVE
DROWNED AFTER
FALL IN WATER
Remington Anns Worker's
Body Found at Foot of
Nichols Street.
The lifeless body of Thomas Hayes,
40 years of age, of 34 Rosedale street,
was found floating in the sewer basin
at the , foot '' of Nichols street, East
Bridgeport, at 6:55 o'clock this morn
ing, by Tony Voccola, a special po-
tile Co., located near the scene.
In the opinion, of the police, Hayes,
who was employed toy the Remington
Arms Co., wandered down Nichols
street, from .Kossuth. At the foot of
Nichols street,, running down to the
water's edge is a steep bank and it
is thought that Hayes In the darkness
not realizing his danger walked down
the bank, slipped, fell into the wateri
and drowned.
Hayes, who is survived by a widow
and five children, the oldest a boy
of 14 years, is believed to be the man
who was-seen at 7 o'clock last night,
wandering along Nichols street, at
Kossuth street, under an electric light,
by Benjamin East, a watchman In
Textile works.
East was busy at the time and on
going to look for the man later was
unable to find any trace of him. Real-,
lzing the danger in this section at
night, and the fact that the waters
at this point have taken a toll of four
lives in . several years, he informed
Vovola this morning of the incident
and his fears. The latter on making
a search discovered Hayes'v body, the
head above water, floating -in an up
right position, in the basin.
Sergeant T. H.' Flood and Police
man 'Patrick Murphy were sent to
the scene and the body removed to
themorgue. In the opinion of Med
ical Examiner Garlick the body had
been 'in the' water several hours, and
although no cries for help were
heard In -the vicinity, from the cir
cumstances and the autopsy the phy
sician believes the drowning was
purely accidental. ; '
Hayes came here from New York
last July, and obtained a position in
the Remington Arms Co. About four
weeks ago he brought his wife and
family to this city from New York.

MAY CARRY U- S. MAIL
Washington, Nov. 3 If the agents
of the German, merchant submarine
Deutschland will signify that she is
available for carrying mail to Ger
many the post office department will
be so notified in a formal communi
cation from the German embassy.
Count Von Bernstorff, the "German
ambassador, has asked the . agents to
inform him on the subject. The post
office department already has declar
ed its willingness to accept a pro
posal to establish a regular undersea
mail service. . ,
The embassy's plans; for. th? es
tablishment of this service- are pro
gressing notwithstanding statements
made in New London yesterday by
Dr. George Ahrens, an attache who
inferred that it was unlikely that the
Deutschland would carry United
States mail. No explanation of the
attache's statements was offered to
day at the embassy, ' .
. Embassy officials said that none but
official mail pouches were brought
over on the peutschland. Clerks to
day were sorting? this and many offi
cial despatches were being deciphered.
The embassy ' had believed that a
juantity of regular first class mail
would come on the, submarine, hav
ing been informed before the vessel
left Bremen on Oct. 1 that some was
being prepared for dispatch. It is
presumed by embassy officials that
through some delay the mails failed to
reach the Deutschland on time.

WILLIAM H. FOX
TO RETIRE AFTER
VARIED CAREER
Wall Paper Co. Head the
Oldest Active Merchant
in Bridgeport.
William II. Fox, owner of the Fox
Wall Paper Company, - located at 163
Golden Hill street,' and undoubtedly
the oldest active merchant in Bridge
port has announced his intention of
retiring from commercial pursuit af
ter more than half a century. With
the a"Ssistarice of his son he will care
for ' the large realty interests he has
acquired in this city and outlying
towns. ' . - ;
Mr. Fox began his career as a news
boy in the employ of the Bridgeport
Farmer about 1860. . After several
years, experience in the news line he
entered the grocery establishment of
William Hall, located where Davis &
Savard are now centralized. At that
time the location was considered some
what outside of the business district.
After ,a year or so as a clefk Mr.
Fox returned to school but again re
turned to the grocery business in the
employ of Ferris & Sherwood, located
in Main street where Bill's Hat store
now stands. The junior partner in
this concern, H. C. Sherwood is
still alive.
Having served his apprenticeship
with Ferris and Sherwood, Mr. Fox
then formed partnership with James
Lyons, and for six years conducted a
grocery business where Dorsen's Dry
Goods store is now located.
Opportunity to branch out as a
manufacturer appeared and the firm
of W. H. Fox and Henry C. Rand was
formed. They manufactured mantels
for builders and were highly success
ful in a Water street location now oc
cupied by, the Hayes Fish market.
This firm was later continued under
George P. Rand, a brother of the for
mer partner. For a while during the
early 80's Mr. Fox conducted a meat
market in Middle street.
About 17 years ago he removed to
a large property owned by him near
Congress and Mafci streets which he
left when the Poli theatre was built
and has since carried on his trade in
wall papers at the Golden Hill street
store.
As a realty investor he has been
highly successful and in the possession
of vigorous health, at "an age of 68
years, Mr. Fox proposes to lighten the
the arduous labors that have been the
keynote of his success.

Attempts of the allies to advance

TITLE DISPUTE
OF OLD NODLE
FAMILY ESTATE
. i
Two Heirs File Papers To
day Asking Court to Set
tle Question.
Fearing litigation over the, owner
ship of the valuable Noble property on
Stratford avenue, Henrietta Noble of
this eity and Fanny S. DePuy of Jen
kinstown, Pa., have filed papers in the
superior court asking that the court
settle the question, of title. The plain
tiffs claim title because they have been
In undisputed possesslbn for more' than
15 years.
The property consists of four par
cels, three on the north side of Strat
ford avenue an'd one on the south side
of the thoroughfare. The. first parcel
on the morth side ' is bounded on the
west by the Automatic , Machine Co.
property. The - other two plots con
tinue to Kossuth street and the most
easterly includes the old Noble home
stead. On th-e south side of the ave
nue the property is bounded on the
west. by. the harbor and by land owned
by ' Peter W. "Wren.
The plaintiffs gained title from their
grandfather, Benjamin Brooks, . a
prominent figure in the early history
of Bridgeport. He died in 1847. The
parents of the plaintiff .were Col. and
Mrs. William H. Noble, also, active in
the city's life. William and Harriet
streets and Noble avenue were named
after members of the Noble familyr. .
In: the present action the defend
ants, who are heirs of other .branches
of. the Noble, family, are: Kenneth - B.
Noble of Hartford,- Edith' Lanib of
Coatesville, Pa., , Annie . F.. Wal'do of
this city,: Benjamin Brooks of San
Louis, Obispo, Cal., Louisa Campbell,
Ella A. Porter Vnd John A. DeRuyter
of New York, and "others. The com
plaint asks . that the defendants be
summoned to court, to state their
claims to the property, If they have
any.'
The city recently took part of the
property in order ta widen Stratford
avenue but probably will not make
any payments while litigation is pend
ing. It is estimated that the property
is worth at least $60,000.

William G. Steele, president of the;

morning that forceful action will be
taken at the meeting. :
"We certainly shall do something: 1
about it," declared Mr Steele, "and
I don't think our protest will be kepfe

"About a month ago we sent a com
munication to the mayor, "the com
mon council and the boards of flre
and police commissioners. We pro
tested the competition of men work
ing for $2.75 a day with men being !
paid union rates, especially when the
cheaper workmen were paid to do i
something else.
"We got no satisfaction, although ,
I understand the excuse of the police

It is known that the umon sent a

fire "commissioners didn't make the; j

of as many policemen as can be pro
vided for by taking money away from "
skilled labor. '
