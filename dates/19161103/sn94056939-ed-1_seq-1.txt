To the Voters of
New Mexico:
During the two months of the
nresont cnmimiirn candidates on
the Rcnubl can sUite ticket havo
boon subjected to a rising flood of
villiflcation, slander and porsonnl
abuse from the Pemocratic candi
dates, their campaign managers
and their newspapers. The cam
paign these men have made from
the platform and through their
newspapers has been more evil
than campaigns made by the same,
men in former years. In the past
and during the present campaign
these assaults have been borne by
the Republican party, its candi
dates and its committeemen with
patience, dignity and restraint.
The campaign made by and in
behalf of the Democratic candi
dates lias been unrelieved by any
record or any statement of fact.
It has been a campaign of unre
strained slander. It has been a
deliberately nlanued and a ruth
lessly executed effort to ruin tho
characters of honorable men. Ab
solutely nothinir has been snared.
The public records of the Repub
lican candidates, their private
business nluurs, their personal
lives and their homes all havo
been assailed through the news
papers supporting the Democratic
candidates, from the platform by
the Democratic candidates them
selves nnd throucrh false state
ments. systematically circulated
among the people by word of
mouth.
Tho Uenublicans of New Mex
ico, their candidates and their
activo party workers and commit
teemen have endured these out
rages with patience and forbear
ance. They have met slander
with ofllcial liublic records. They
have believed and now believe
that tho people of New Mexico
are of sound judgement and that
they cannot be tricked by distor
tions of facts or fooled by lies.
As this campaign has drawn to
ward its close tho flood of Demo
cratic abuse has risen to its crest
Within the past few days tho
Democratic candidates and their
managers have gone beyond the
limit of wrongful assault which
men of honor and courage can en
duro In silence.
Posing as mun of honest ro
cords and clean lives the heads
of the Democratic ticket, assist
ed by their managors and their
nowsnanurs have exceeded nnv
thing heretofore dono by them in
the promulgation of falsehood
foul insinuation and deliberate
slander.
During tho past few days there
nas commenced to appear in the
Albuquerque Morning Journal
anil tho banta Fe New Mexican,
tho principal newspaper supiwrt
ors of A. A. Jones and William
C. McDonald, certain fragments
of alleged letters: a sentence and
a half-statement, strung together

which, it is made to appear, have
been dishonorable transactions
and against the public interest.
lho direct inference drawn by
these men through their news
papers is that tho whole active
membership of the Republican
party from the leaders in Colfax
county to the leaders in Dona Ana
county and throughout the stato
have been grafters, corruptionist3
and thieves.

For several years A. A. Jones,
tho Democratic candidate for tho
United States Senate, han been
the directing force in the Demo
cratic party in New Mexico. Ho
is the directing force in the pre
sent campaign, Remaining nl
ways in tho background of the
attack and posing always as a
man of high principle and pure
life, Jones has planned the Dcmo-j
cratic campaigns and has pulled
tho strings which have directed i
the outpouring of slime. He has
been careful to speak none of tho
libels personally. Rut those libels I
have been spoken in Iim presence
and with his knowledge, consent
and connivance Ho is the real
head of the Democratic organiza
tion and tho campaign it has wag
ed and is now waging is of his
planning.
In justice to its candidates and
its membership the Republican
party cannot longer sit quiet and
permit unworthy mon to slander
men of clean lives, square records
and sterling character. It is not
LEOPARD CHANCE
necessary that Republicans reply
to a s ander with slander, it i
necessary, however, that its place
before the reoplc squarely and
accurately tho characters and tho
records of the men who arc direct
ing the cnmpa'gn of villification
against the Republican candi
dates. The facts in tho caso of A. A.
Jones wore known to the leaders
of his nartv when he was nom-
inattd. Had they been known to
the rank and file of his party
Jones would not have been nom
inated. The Republicans do not
charge to the rank and file of
Now Mexico Democrats any part
of the campaign of libel which
the Democraiu lcU.ru have
made. The facts in the case of
A, A. Jones were known to many
leading Republicans. No refer
ence has been made to those facts
by any Republican holding a re-
had not been tho purpose ol Ke-
was un injustico to the people or
New Mexico.
The statement of tho facts in
the case of A. A. Jones, now be
ing made to the voters of Now
Mexico, has been made by the
Republican State Committeo with
reluctance, and It has been made
solely because this man, who is
the directing mind in the Demo-
cratic campaign of libel, lias gono
ly before the people in the light
nf Urn fnnlM in his rm-rml.
The Republicans, in presenting!
mese nicis, might bo juatuieu in
stating that "tho letters ot'adead
woman will defeat A. A. Jones
for the United States Senato,"
There is, however, no desire
for sensational statement on tho
part of any Republican. Tho
facts as they are presented are
sulllciunt. They will be permitted
to speak fr themselves Tiieso
facts aru presented by means of
photographs of letters written by
a dead woman, and that woman
tho wife of A. A. Jones. These
facts, as revealed by these tragic
letters, will bo left to the people
of New Mexico, for their judg
ment upon the same.
The originals of these letters
have been in possession of tho
Republican State Committee
since tho very .beginning of this
campaign. It was the opinion of
those briniriiiR them to the alten
tion of tho Committee that justice
to tho people of New Mexico do
mamled their publication, The
task was of such
a nature that

tho Commfttee hesitated and re
frained, nnd would Rtijl .'efraln

justice to the Republican candi
dates demands that slander bo
met with facts, and distorted rec

without embellishment.
Tho statement of Üiír record is
not a pleasant one. It is not a
statement for tho gereral nublic.
But it is a statement of the rec
ord of A. A. Jones, to which tho
voters of New Mexico are entitled
before they proceed to cast their
bailóla In tho election of Tuesday
next.
The letters referred to here,
the originals of which are in pos
session of the Republican State
Committee, have been photo
graphed, rrom these photo
irranhs nlatcs have been made.
and from these plates a pamphlet
has been printed, which pamph
let is now being distributed to tho
voters ot New Mexico.
There will be no co:nnipnt here

further reference to the facts In

party managers. I Ins present

circulation only in ordo" that
there may be no ground for a
