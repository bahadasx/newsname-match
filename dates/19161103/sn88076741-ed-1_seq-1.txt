THE PROGRESS OP THE WAR.
The news from the various battle lines
this week as usual shows some rather
heavy fighting at various points with
successes claimed by both sides. In
Roumania the Russians and Roumanians
claim to have driven baok the Austrian
Advance,
while on the south the Rou
manians are in retreat.
Three ships are torpedoed in the Chan
nel. Of one. of these there are no details
at all, another was torpedoed while run
ning away, and the third the

warning^ Some Americans were drown

HIR-CFFVIL -SBRVICK
The "civilservice" this administration
has shown to be a farce.
For example right 'here in Pembina
county almost every republican post
master has been fired and replaced by a
.democrat through the "civil service'
'Channel, and by the -same means the
•new postmasters have been settled to
their jobs for life. Some of the republi
can postmasters thus displaced were in
the postal service
many years, but
apparently when the examination took
place they had forgotten how to handle
mail. Humbug and fraud, that's all
Even the kindly Secretary Bryan had a
warm place in his heart for "desereving
democrats."
WEAK CABINET SELHCTION8
MrAWilson's cabinet show that for the
most part weak elections, Hhe chargee
in the cabinet show that the eratio
changes in Mr. Wilson's opinions. Mr,
Bryan as secretary of state signed one
diplimatic note to German Later be
resigned that then sign another note on
the same subject. What was wrong?
The notes or Mr. Wilson or Mr. Bryan?
Evidently something or somebody had
changed opinions from the time of one
note to the other. We leave the demo
crats to decide. Only there was vacil
Jation.
On the aiatter of preparedness his
Secretary of War resigned because Mr.
Wilson had again changed his mind
after announcing his first views.
^Everybody, including most democrats
have been hoping that Secretary of the
Navy, Josegjiug Daniels, would also get
mad and vaccate, He still resumes the
clown of the cabinet.
THE EUROPEAN WAS
Mr. Wilson's course in diplomacy with
the warring nations of Europe covers
too muoh ground to particularize in an
article of this length. Suffice to say
that his diplomacy has neither pleased
the Teutonic or the Entente Allies. All
nuetral nations have looked in vain for
the United States, the largest and most
powerful of the neutral nations, for
leadership and show of power. The war
ring and neutral nations have alike
learned from Mr. Wilson that "We are
too proud to fight." Whatever Mr. Wil
son may have meant by this expression,
there is no doubt of the meaning placed
upon it by both beligerants and neutrals.
Just now we are the most despised na
tion on the face of the earth—except
possibly Ohina.
Hundreds of Americans have been
drowned, or put in imminent danger or
suffered severe hardships, mails have
been censored and robbed, ships seized
and detained, our ports blockaded, but
we are "too proud to fight it" alt—and
knowing that we get
BO
tkra from these nations who at this time
will heed nothing exoept force «r fear of
it.
Therc has been wliaie yet in the
Buy eon war tat that any «ne of tht
waning Batons woatd have heeded any
reaoonabie request wade bytihis countiy
aitefeebaM«odoa Vhe behalf of other
aetftrols, •onged with firmness. But
quests backed with the assertion that
"'we are too proud to tight" are not eon
sidered urgent by the fighting natypat.
mm MancAN smrAVioN.
Many of our waders have not time to
•fallow out the (rather sabtile dipkxiatic
controversies «f the iBuropean war as
they concern ibis-country, 'but 'here at
aur doors is iperhaps the most disgrace
ful and ridicalous diplomatic and actual
conglomeration ever an the history of
thi8'or:perhapsany ather coantay.
The Democrats claim that Mr. Wilson
has kept this country out of war. The
Judge Advocate of the army, who ought
to know, last week decided that this
country was at war with Mexico. If
taking Vera Cruz
by
force of arms was
not an act of offensive war then what
would it be called? If keeping a stand
ing army in Mexico is not war what is
it? If holding a military force all along
our body is not a proceeding like war
what is it? Any such mobilization in
torce in Europe would be questioned
forthwith. The fact is wa would be at
warawith Mexico today—if there was a
real Mexico.
THE BAUIBQAD SWITCH
A few weeks ago 400,000 railway train
men demanded that the Democratic
Congress should pass what they called
an eight hour law but which was really
a demand for an increase in pay. With
out arbitration or question, Mr. Wilson
took it upon himself to decide this ques
tion involving about fifty million dollars
and insisted that the Congress pas^ the
eight hour law "before Saturday night,"
and these, the president and representa
tives of ninety millions of people, were
"too proud- to fight*' and knuckled down
Mr. Wilson settled this question by just
passing the burden along, by allowing
the managers to the privilege of raising
freight rates. The men were pleased
the employers were pleaded—and the
publio pay the freight. Mr. Wilson also
kept us out of war with the railway
brotherhoods—by using a "switch."
There are scores of other things of
which the history is similar, but we re
frain,
PEACEFUL WILSON VS WAR MAN HUGHES
The Democratic slogan is that Mr.
Wilson is for peace, Mr. Hughes is for
war. Any thinking man knows tbat
no one in this country wants war.
This writer is not fond of automobile
riding, but when be does enter an auto
mobile he would prefer to ride twenty-,
five or thirty-five miles an hour with a
steady chaffeur who keeps in the mid
dle of the road and is onto his job, than
ride with some kid who is afraid to run
more than twenty miles an hour and
who runs the car to the side of the track
if he happens to see a lump of mud
ahead. Whei^ a chaffeur is so careful
that he runs the car zig-zag across the
road because he is afraid of every little
obstacle then the car is apt to skid.
We have been mighty lucky so far that
in Mr. Wilson's erratic course we have
not skidded into war. He thinks it was
because of his dodging, we think it was
just luck—and that it was "busy days"
with the beligerent nations. Germany

Two.yean-ago President Wilson sent income apart of the chief executive of
-a 'fleet of warships to Vera Oruz to get
the Mexican-government ito -salute our
ifiag afteran international insult. The
-ships 'landed crews and after battle in
which a 'number «of Amerioan. seamen1
wese killed as well as some Mexicans
-and-the city taken—then our ships took
•their -men -on board and eatne home.
That's all. A short time age Villa anda
band assaulted the town df Columbus,
an American city. A number of Ameri
cans, -men, women and children were
•killed vwounded .and taken prisoners.
Xhen General Pershing with a fractional
-Amerioan army was sent across the liae
•to arrest Villa. J3ut Carranza, the head
•of the '*de .facta" government, ordered
-Gen. tPershing not to go any farther
.south in pursuit of Villa. A company
•of American-soldiers #ho were marching
'in a direction contrary to Carransa'«
•orders, were ambushed, some were mur
dered, others wounded and all were
•either captured or dispersed. Villa has
•now oome to the north of his own ao
-cord and is .again threatening our bor
der vwhich is however oeing guarded by
our .militia boys in a strung out line
reaching about .fifteen hundred miles
and whose force at anyone point would
be useless against any considerable body
of Mexican bandits.
.Now if we had aright to go into Mex
ico at all we had aright to keep on go
ing -until we accomplished out objective.
Otherwise we had better stayed at home.

la ordinary times Mr. Wilsoa might

fcis time things have been too fcifc for

$The queetlons df the next four years will

When a Democratic -candidate asks

^bat he will vote his patty ticket. It is
iipoor rule tbat won't work both ways.
I dEtan't try to judge a -congressman's or

Stiff knees, aching limbs, lame back
make life a burden. If you suffer from
rheumatism, gout, lumbago, neuralgia,
get a bottle of Sloan's Liniment, the uni
versal remedy for pain. Easy to apply
it penetrates without rubbing and sooth

effective than mus9y ointments or poul

from strenuous exercise, Sloan's Lini
ment gives quick relief. Keep it on

Clear Bad Skin From Within
Pimply, muddy complexions are due
to impurities in the blood. Clear up
the skin by taking Dr. King's New Life
Pills. Their mild laxative qualities re
move the poisons from the system and
brighten the eye. A full, free, non
griping bowel movement in the morning
is the reward of a dose of Dr. King's
New Life Pills the night before. At
