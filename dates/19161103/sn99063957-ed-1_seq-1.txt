Eugene. Ore., Nov. 3 Gil Dobio's un
defeated University of Washington elev
en landed iu Eugene today and begau
girding up Its loins for the big game
with Oregon tomorrow.
Light signul practice on a sloppy
field was all Dobie attempted. The
weather was dark and rainy. All of
which looks good for Washington, as it
slows up the game and the Seattle hea
vyweight will have a chauce to make
their avoirdupois count for yardage.
Washington was given a regular poli
tical reception wheu it arrived. The
boys found a string of automobiles wait
ing to carry them to the campus, and de
trained amid cheers and honks.
Manager Young nppeured with Wash
ington, and immediately sought a con
fab with Graduate Manager Tiffany of
Oregon. It was understood that Young
er was armed with documentary evi
dence against Johnny I'arsons the
speedy Oregon back and ugainst two
other Oregon players. Among other
allegations, playing under assumed
names and professionalism are said to
bo chtarged. All the claims are flatly
denied by the Oregon faculty athletic
committee.
Final licks were put on the grand
stands and bleachers today. With tem

Jot in many years, if ever, has such
an interest beeu tuken in the football
encounter between the two most bitter
rivals iu the Pacific Coast conference.
In betting circles today Oregon money
was plentiful while Washington bettors
were a little backward about hanging
up big bets on the wearers of the pur
ple and gold. Several bets for large
sums were made at even money, how-

The scene at the I uiou depot tonight

ditional names on the list A number of

urbs and have not reported. Committees
that today were unable to see prospects

passed.
Chairman George Bodgers of the cam
paign committee, President Albert of
the Commercial club, as well as Man
ager McDaniel, are Jubilant over the
outcome and feel that definite results
will accrue to the city because of the
additions made. '
Observance of the first annual "Sa

stimulating co-operation between the
citizenship of the city and the Commer
cial club, comes to an end tonight- The

have voluntarily come to the club rooms
and applied for membership is gratify
ing indeed," says Mr. McDaniel. "It
shows that the spirit of the week reach
ed into every section of Salem.. I ex
pect the co-operation of the citizens and
the club in the future will be the means
of bringing much prosperity of a last
ing nature to Salem.-"
Yesterday was visiting day at the fac
tories and plants of the city. In spite
of the rain many took advantage of the
opportunity to see and learn at first
hand the steps in manufacturing the va
rious products.
That "Salem Week" will beeome an
annual affair is now believed certain.
The results of the first celebration of
the week are already to be seen and all
who worked to make the event a success
feel well repaid for their fforts.
Style Show Great.
Tonight brings the Merchants' Dress
Up Show at the Oregon theatre to a
close. It also sees the finish of the con
test for the most popular local model
who is taking part in the show.
Salem is being combed today by the
various contestants for votes and the
closhing minutes of this big Merchants'
co-operative effort will surely be ex
citing. For tonight's show there will be a
complete change of garments with a new
picture program. Several new ideas
have been worked into the production
and it was much better last night than
on Wednesday. Everybody who attend
ed the show last night went away more
than satisfied.
The merchandise shown last night was
a revelation to the big crowd present.
The girls worked better and the show
ran smoothly. Tonight promises to be
the best performance of the three days
find the theatre should be filled to stand
ing room early in the evening.
."This style show is an unpnialelled
success from an artistic standpoint,"
declared A. E. Laflar, manager of the
Oregon theatre. "We have not had an
attraction at the Oregon for a long time
that pleased everybody so well as did
the style show last night. While the ex
pense of producing (his show has been
enormous, yet we are more than glad to
be able to assist in an enterprise that
will be of inestimable worth to the mer
chants and the buyers of this city."
Lo-operation ih von. The merchants
got together and through combined ef
forts made possible a show that would
do credit to a larger, much larger city.
It has tended to bring the business in
terests of Salem closer together and
the show has done a great deal to dem
ount rate to Salem men and women the
class and character of uierchandise to
be secured here.
"I am satisfied with the show," said
A. H. Allen, who produced it for the
local firms. "The young ladies and the
young men who have worked with us
have done remarkably well. The mer
chants have all shown a splendid spirit
of unselfishness and the public has been
extremely responsive to our humlde ef
forts. I am glad that this community

San Francisco May Take This
Plan to Check Food
Prices
San Francisco, Nov. 3. A municipal
grocery store may, be San Francisco's
answer to the present high cost of liv
ing. Supervisor Charles Nelson declared to
day that he would soon introduce an
ordinance providing for the establish
ment of a warehouse for the distribution
of provisions at moderate prices.
"A famine is facing the poorer
classes in San Francisco by reason of
the enormous increases in food prices-"
said Nelson. "I know of cases here
where families arc actually going with
out proper nourishment because of their
inability to pay the grocer and their
rent at the same t(me.
' ' Unless there is a speedy improve
ment in conditions, I propose to urge the
establishment of a hew city department
a municipal grocery, if you like. It
would involve purchase by the city of
huge quantities of provisions and hold
ing them against prohibitive prices that
may develop. Those provisions could
be sold at rock bottom prices the city
aiming to do nothing more than pay ex
penses.' '

By Perry Arnold.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Hudson, N. Y., Nov. 3. By the time
Charles E. Hughes reaches New York
Ctiy tonight his tours for votes complet
ed, ho will have traveled close to 30,000
miles. Members of the Hughes party
estimate he has been seen by nearly one
third of the voters of the United States
in tho most comprehensive, nerve rack
ing oral marathon for votes any presi
dential candidate has ever undergone.
Save for about 12 days, the republi
can nominee has been continuouslv trav.
eling and stumping Biuce August 5.
He has made speeches in 32 of the 4S
states and passed through two or three
more without talking. He has been as
far north as Bangor, Maine; as far
south as Nashville, Tenn., as far west
as the Pacific slope. For the most part
he has traveled on the first camnaiirn
special de luxe ever introduced in Amer
ican politics. He finishes his camnnipn
tour in perfect physical trim.
"Governor Hughes is snlendidlv fit. "
said his physician, Dr. Callisan, today.
"There isn't even any seriousness to the
coninuon or his larynx from the tre
mendous strain be has put on his voice.
No man, unless he la. .absolutely if
could have stood the strain to which
the republican nominee has heen mih.
jeeted and have finished in the perfect
condition of body and nerves, that Gov
ernor nugnes nas."
Spoke Two Million Word.
Hughes has made about 500 speeches
in the 12 1-2 weeks durinir which Ho hn
been actively campaigning. He has spok
en pornaps iwo munon words of argu
mentwhich averages 66 words to each
traveled mile.
Throughout the 30.000 miles n1 with.
in sound of his voice on about 495 of
the 500 speeches has been Mrs. Huphea
the governor's advisor, bjs critic, his
"boss," when it came to ordering him
to rest and last of all, his most enthus
iastic booster. Mrs. Hughes has left a
trail of buttons across the entire nation
and has shaken almost as many hands
and patted just as many bubies' heads
as her husband.
The candidate particularlized on com
mercial conditions here and abroad aft
er the war in his speech here. He quot
ed again from the speech of Chairman
nuney oi tne federal trade commission
on the need for combatting European
rivalry at tho close of the struggle.
"I agreo with Hurley as to the neces
sity for organization and efficiency,"
he Baid. "But he stops short of a full
conclusion, which, it seems to me, he
should have reported; because we may
have a very high degree of efficiency
and wc should develop it to the ultmost;
and we may have tho best possible or
ganization and we should do far more
tnan we have done to encourage it and
still we may not be able to compete with
Europe, where there is at lenst equal or
ganization and equal efficiency."
npcaKing or democratic promises, he
said:
"When people talk to me about their
bay windows ond present prospects
inui mey are going to enjoy in consider
ing the country while looking through
these beautifully built windows, I ask:
Well, where is the foundation for your
housef If you do not have a founda
tion for your house all you have got
is a casiie in tne air. Ana tne toundu
tion of this house of improvement, of
good wages, of proper hours, of whole-
sonuj conditions of work the foundation
of that house is the stability of Ameri
can enterprise and the opportunity for
work. There has got to be employment
in this country before we can talk about
tho conditions of employment."
Mrs. Hughes left the special train
here in order to hasten to Newark to
welcome the women's Hughes trans con
tinental campaigners.
Government Ready

Washington, Nov. 3. The govern
ment is now practically ready to tako

auxiliaries in case of war.
Blank contracts are being drawn up
by the navy department, it was learn
ed today. When completed, the con
tracts will lack only t lie price to be
paid for the vessel and the signature
of the owner. The price will depend
on trade conditions.
Naval officers who will command the
ships, in case of war, already have been
selected. Plans of the navy department
