Across the road we are to travel
this next four years, even though we
start right and move with prudence
and courage, serious hazards are
thrown like breaks in a roadway
made by a torrential rain. These all
rise out of the war torrent which has
overwhelmed Europe. The first has
to do with our foreign relations. It
Is the president's duty to safeguard
the Interests of our own nation and
1 to maintain the peace which the
United States, Spain, Sweden, Nor
way nnd all the American republics
row enjoy. Out I should seek to
maintain that peace by a firm and
courteous Insistence on the rights of
our citizens at home and abroad.

men Should Use Only Pure Bred
Sire of Dairy Type.
"Since I was here two years ago a
marked improvement has been made
by the farmers or Klamath county in
general farming conditions," said
Prof. Edward B. Fltts, extension lec
turer from Oregon Agricultural Col
lege. Prof. Fltts has just completed,
with Prof. J. E. Larson and Miss
Anna M. Turley, four farmers' short
courses in Klamath county one held
at Plevna, one at Mt. Lakl, one at
Merrill and one at Bonanza.
"There is one general criticism I
would 'make on the methods of dairy
ing In Klamath county," said Prof,
Fltts. "That Is, on the type or
stock used. Many or the farmers are
trying to do a dairy business and still
make beef out or the steers from the
dairy cows. This cannot be done prof
itably. "It is far better to kill or sell tbe
steer calves when born and give the
reed that would be given to the steers
to more milk cows. One cannot run
a Joint dairy and beer business and
make both pay.
"Another shortcoming of Klamath
county dairymen Is the type of sires
used. These should be pure bred
stock and or dairy breeds, and no at
tempt should be made to use a sire
that will produce beer stock.
"I have great faith in the adapt-
ability of Klamath county to dairy-

that was said:- It Bh'ows a genutne
