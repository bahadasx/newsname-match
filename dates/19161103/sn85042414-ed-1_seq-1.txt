ALIENIST MANIAC ON
HIS WEDDING NIGHT
Chicago Expert Slay Sot Recall
Elopement When Recovered,
Physician Says.
Chicago, Nov. 3.—There is a possi
bility that Dr- Emit Bunta, resident
alienist at the psychopathic hospital,
will not remember-his marriage last
Saturday when he recovers from a
temporary lapse of sanity. He slept
last night for the first time in 14 days
and "appeared to be perfectly nor
mal" today, according to Dr. Adam
Szwajkart, county physician.
Dr. Bunta was married last Satur
day. His bride, formerly head nurse
at the hospital, with- whom he eloped
to Crown Point, Ind., is in the. care
of friends. The terror of that night
in the bridal suite of the Morrison ho
tel, when her husband changed from
her lover into a maniac, has shatter
ed her nerves.
Dr. Sswajkart declared he expect
ed Dr. Bunta to toe entirely recover
ed in a few days. When asked if Dr.
Bunta called for his wife, he s&ld:
"I have not Bald anything regard
ins her- I am waiting for him to say
something. I am afraid that a shock
might put him back where he was.
We do not know if he remembers his
marriage, but I believe that he will
recall it in time.
Bunta, while at Wisconsin univer
sity, was a crack athlete. He was
formerly head of the insanity division
of the Cook hospital and is recognised
as an expert In mental diseases.

Biggest Part of $190,000

Each Student Expends Ap
proximately $500 During

The value of the university as an
asset to,.the city is shown'in the list

faculty and employes ofthe school,
which have beeu- compiled at-the Yri

In the city and naturally the greater
part of the salary would be spent here.
Nearly $1.90,000 are received by the
faculty and employes and practically
all of this is spent in the city.
The Commons, the boarding depart
ment, spends about $55,000 annually
fdr supplies, and the wholesale houses
of the city receive the largest part
of this-amount. Beside this, the school
spends about $65,000, at least 90 per
cent of its income, here for. equip
ment and supplies for the various de
partments.
Student Spends $500.
The figures show that a student
spends on an average of $600 a year
while attending school. This, sum in
cludes only boarding and school ex
penses, the expenditure for recreation
not being included in the list. The
students alone spend about $400,000
yearly in the business places of the
city.
Another point of interest to be men*
tioned in this connection is that par
ents and relatives of the students
come to the city to visit and to shop,
and this also brings a large revenue
to the merchants of the city. In this'
manner, persons from the smaller
towns and cities become acquainted
with the dealers and in the future
will trade by mail, if they are unable
to come and do their shopping in per

The events at the university, in
cluding commencement exercises,
pageants, athletics and oratorical af
fairs bring large numbers to the
city, which means much additional

The Dimes at the Washington Dead Letter Office.
Washington, Nov. 3.—The mail
sacks shown in the accompanying
photograph contain some $7,000 in
dimes enclosed in 70,000 letters mail
ed by trusting women to a Minne
apolis concern which started an end
less chain letter system. The letters
promised to deliver a $4."50 petticoat.
"1917 model," for ten cents. The
Minneapolis postmaster delivered a
few of these letters to the firm which
started them, but a fraud order soon
stopped the delivery of the dimes.
Of the 500,000 letters which con
tinued to pour in, some sixty per cent
were returned to senders who had
given return addresses, and the others
had to be forwarded to the dead let
ter office, where they are being open
ed and returned with their contents
to the senders:
It' costs the government about, ten
cents to return each of these letters.
Endless chain correspondence, there
fore, is frowned upon by government
officials. The only way Uncle Sam
breaks even on fraud order mail and
Illegibly addressed envelopes is in the
receipt of from $70,000 to $75,000 a
year which cannot be traced to its
owners. The salaries of the dead let
ter office force just about reach" this
total.

"American Aviation Corps"
is Title Embarrassing to
Washington.
Wamington, Nov. ».—The famous
American aviation corps of the French
army probably soon will lose officially
its distinctive title as a result of pre
tests to the state department that the
use of the name is not compatible
with American neutrality. There will
be no formal exchanges on the sub
ject, but the state department will
suggest informally to the French for
eign office that mention of the
"American" corps in official com
muniques places this country in an
embarrassing position-
The corps, made up of a large num
ber of young American aviators, was
recruited and organized as a separate
unit by special permission of the
French military authorities. Its mem
bers have distinguished themselves
time and again, particularly In the
fighting around Verdun.
When Klffen Rockwell was killed in
September, German newspapers print
ed violent attacks on the United
States, declaring that the presence of
Americans in the French army was
proof that this country's neutrality
was vanishing.
Later, however, the semi-official
Overseas News Agency announced
that the imperial government did not
consider the volunteering of Ameri
cans as a breach of neutrality.
The complaints to the state depart
ment followed a recent reference to
the Americans in an official com
munique from the French war office.
Precedent for action was set early in
the war, when at the informal request
of the Washington government Great
Britain had the name "American
Legion" withdrawn from a Canadian
contingent that was being recruited
from the United States.
Paris, Nov. 3.—The dispatch re
eeived here from Nancy yesterday
had been killed near that city proves
to have been erroneous. The Associ
ated Press is informed that no Amer
ican aviator has met with an accident
since Norman Prince was fatally in
jured some time ago.

Berlin, Nov. 8.—Fort Vaux at Ver

November 1 and 2, in accordance
with prearranged plans, according to
the German military leaders, who in
dicated that they considered the sac
rifices involved in its retention out of
proportion to its value in the present
German strategic scheme.
The Associated Press representative
was Informed on the evening of No-
Forts Douaumont and Vaux, it was

this was accomplished the reins of the

Germans and served chiefly as targets
for the French artillery.
Now that Fort Douaumont had
passed again into French possession.
Fort Vaux no longer, in the opinion
of the German leaders, justified the
heavy sacrifices necessary to retain
the ground about the fort, which is
ill-adapted to defense against attacks
from the south and west. Fort Vaux
was therefore abandoned, and the
German lines retired to positions less

The Herald One Victim of
Latest Screed and. Will
Print it—At the Price.
Fargo, N. D., Nov. 3.—It has been
a tough week for the Democrats ol
North Dakota—more particularly for
those of Fargo.
Somebody published an advertise
ment setting forth the supposition
that John Burke. Democratic candi
date for United States senator, has
been working for the election of D.
H. McArthur. Democratic candidate
for governor. Because he has had the
temerity to oppose Lynn J. Frazler,
the Republican candidate for gover
nor. the Democrats are aroused.
One might even declare they were
excited.
The disavowal came when a full
page advertisement in a Fargo news-
declaring that "Wilson, Burke and
McArthur would carry the state." was
published by the Republicans—to be
used by them against the Democrats.
William Lemke, chairman of the
Republican state central committee,
in an official statement given out to
day, just as vociferously denounces
the advertisement—declaring that he
has evidence which is practically con
clusive as to the Democratic origin of
the advertisement.
Recalls Attack on McComber.
The advertisement in question was
published over the signature of the
"Independent Publicity Bureau"—an
organization that recently caused the
publication in the state press of a
bitter attack upon United States Sen
ator Porter J. McCumber.
The disturbance has had at least
one effect—accentuating the fact that
John Burke, Democratic candidate for
the senatorship. is holding aloof from
the governorship'—lest he engender
the disfavor of the Nonpartisan league
members—to whom the Democrats
have industriously made overtures
dtirlng the present campaign.
In the meantime. D. H. McArthur,
Democratic candidate for governor,
is,enjoying the situation..
Of course, nobody has accused* Mr.
McArthur'of having a hand in the
publication of the "Wilson. Burke,
McArthur" combination. But Mr.
McArthur denies it, just the same.
Declares he doesn't know where the
advertisement came from and can't
imagine who would do anything like
that.
How The Herald Stands.
And ncv. on top of all this comes
the Democratic State Central com
mittee with a large advertisement
denouncing the Democrats responsible
for the "Independent Publicity
Bureau" and pouring the vials of
wrath upon the newspapers which did
print the advertisement—not taking
into consideration the fact that the
columns of these papers have been
open to all comers in paid political
propoeranda and have been fair to all.
The Grand Forks Herald, being one
of these execrated publications, does
not need to reply, feeling that its fair
ness and firmness in following the
course it believed to be best and most
Just is amply justified and will be so
regarded when the winds of political
passions have been dissipated and our
friends who differ with us once more
look at the situation squarely on its
merits.
The Herald has no quarrel with
any one and will pursue Its way in
dignity and calmness despite the
prejudiced criticisms which can onlv
be judged—and are Judged by the fair
minded—for what they are worth
considering the source from whence
they come- The Herald will stand on

Fargo, N. D., Nov. 3.—County
agents of North Dakota last evening
concluded a three-day conference at

ed that the county agents should

E. Gi Quamme of Finley, a prom
inent banker, and Frank Wilson- of
the farm loan bureau, department ot

the farmers, was Mr. Quamme't main
point, as he presented It this morning.
