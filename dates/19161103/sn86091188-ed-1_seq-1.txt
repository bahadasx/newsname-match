S American people Woodrow Wilson
v gave an accounting of hl« ad
„ 1 ,, ration as their President. He
-lanced hia books" so that the rec
stands clear. Promises fulfilled,
-t deeds done! That, in short,
the story. And yet the story
aot finished. Other chapters In the
t Book of Human Progress re
j to be written. It rests with
American Voters, to say whether
mao who began the book shall
it.
Here, In the President's own
-rda, Is a plain statement of what
as leader not vnly of the Demo
tic party, but of the nation, has
-mpllshed In your behalf and of
hat be plans for your future—a
tement made not alone to the thou
-ds who journeyed here, but to you
nd the hundreds of thousands
oughout the country who célébrât
"Wilson Day."
THE PRESIDENT** SPEECH.
"My Fellow-citizens:
•This Is called 'Wilson Day - only
-use for six years, first as Gover
r of New Jersey and then as Presi
ent of the United States, I have been
rmitted to lead first a great state
ud then a great national party along
he ways of progress and of enlarged
ad regenerated life which our people
d so long sought and so long been
eld back from by the organized
wer of selfish interest, and because
e great honor has fallen to me el
Ing chosen once more spokesman
d representative of the men who
can to hold the country to the«»
ays of peace, humanity and progress
t is of these forces that I shall spea!
not of myself, who am merely
eir servant.
"What are these forces? Whence
o they spring? What have they ae
rmpllshed, and what is their pro
mine and purpose for the future:
t is plain what they are. They are
The forces of humane, righteous, am
patriotic purpose which have sprung !
op in our »lay In the minds of tlios» |
»no perceive the shortcomings of the
law as it has hardened in America
»nd who loqk forward with purpose
«nd conviction to a new age in which
fovemment shall be indeed the
servant of liberty and not of privi
lege. »
These are men who perceive that
American law has not kept pace
»ith American sentiment; that our
■* w has been holding us rigid au»l
immovable, until class has begun, in
free America, to be arrayed against
rlasa; until what was legal has begun
to play a more Important part In our
Noughts and determinations than
»liât Is human and right; and until
America has begun to lag instead of
i«id in reconciling what is with whal
ought to be.

"Four year* ago there were two
parties In the field whose programme
was conceived under the influence of
these great forces of progress and ad
Justment. the Democratic party and
Hie Progressive party. This year
there Is but one. the Democratic party
In the presidential election of four
year* ago some fifteen million vote.»
were cast. Of these, nearly ten and
a half millions were cast for the can
didates of the two progressive parties,
only three and a half millions for the
candidates of the ltepublican party, the
party which lingered in the old ways
and felt none of the new Impulse ot
a new day. More than two-thirds of
the voters of the United States
favored then, and favor now, u pro
gramme whose object Is to serve the
changing needs of humanity and
progress.
'The Democratic party was entrust
ed with the task. These powerful
forces of the new age w-ere put undei
its direction. And under that dire»
rlon what have they accompltslieil?
'They have put both the busiuce
and the life »»f the country upon a
new footing.
Financial Credit Released.
"They have released the financial
credit, upon which commerce and pro
duction alike depend, from the con
trol of small groups of financiers and
hankers at the speculative centers.
"They have released the commerce
and Industry of the country from the
domination of those who were build
ing up their power by selfish and
unfair methods of competition.
"They have supplied those who
wlsheil to conduct their business in
conformity with the spirit of the laws
with friendly guidance and delivered
them fron» a nervous fear of the
courts.
"They have released our foreign
trade from the shackles of a tarif?
contrived in the interest of special

more promptly in the solution of the
many new problems of society with I
which the law must henceforth deal, i
We must unite the Amerh-a*. North
and South, in a new sympathy and co
operation.
"We must seek justice and the right
through every channel that offers;
and we must put America in all It*
force, in all its wealth, alike of phys
teal power and spiritual enthusiasm,
at the service of the other nations of

peace permanent by establishing It on

"And our motto must b* CO-OPERA
TION, the union, dot the hostde rival
ry, of the forces of society within the
nation and within the family of na
tions. The interests of mankind can
never again be served by aggression :
the Interest of no nation or group of
nation« can ever again be serve»! by
aggression. The contests of jealousy
are as bitter and as dangerous as the
»•nntests of arms.
Must Press Reforms.
•The world must henceforth seek
the means of accommodation, uot the
means of arresting quarrels merely.
The nation we love and serve must be
among the first and forem *t of those
that rise to the new ideals with spirit
and well directed force.
"Such Is the prospect, such Is the
programme, my fellow-citizens, to
whlcji we look forward, to which It Is
our purpose to move forward with
enthusiasm anil irresistible ardor. We
will not pause in the midst of our
task. We know that we stand at one
of the most critical Junctures in the
history of the world, when all hopes
hang In the balance.
"We will suffer no man, no body of
men, through timidity or fear or Jeal
ousy, to delay or hinder or embarrass
us. Reaction can have no pluce of
tolerance amongst us when ail the
world waits upon those who plan Jus
tice and progress.
"I summon you, not only to sustain,
but to swell, the hosts that have their
faces now set towards the light, their
eyes lifted to the horizons where the
dawn of a new age begins to brighten .
nnd 1 summon you with confidence,
with a certain expectation of the part
