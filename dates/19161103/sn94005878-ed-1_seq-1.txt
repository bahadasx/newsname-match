artificial lake and stood on the top of
tbe concrete dam.
That reclamation throuch irrigation
was the first need of the arid regions
of the West was declared by Mr.

Mr. Jones said, was that all other re

ucts made possible by Irrigation were
necessary for the support of the In

feet below the crest; GlO.OtXI cubic
yards of concrete are bound together
by interlacing bars of steel. This

lacking only fifty feet of being a mile

storage capacity surpasses any other
ever constructed. When filled, it will
contain wore than 2,600,000 aero feet
of water enough to cover a depth of
one foot an area of 4,200 square miles.
This Is two-thirds more than the com
bined capacity of all the reservoirs
built or projected for the city of
Greater New York. It will actually
submerge more than 42,000 acres of
land, and extend to a máximum length
of forty-five miles. The project Is de
signed to Irrigate and enable the in
tensive cultivation of 180,000 acies of
