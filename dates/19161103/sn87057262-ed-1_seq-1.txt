NEW YORK, Nov. 3.—Thrilled and

President Wilson sailed from here on
the presidential yacht Mayflower to

the welcomers. Police lines were
smashed by flying wedges.
Twenty-three thousand Tammany

late afternoon, purchasing a yellow
chiffon gown, embroidered in gold and
trimmed with narrow bands of mole

H. H. TTfl.min of the Northwestern line, although he said his road had been able to meet
the tremendous demand for cars to date, declared that when Iowa's principal crop begins
to be moved, there might be a shortage on the Northwestern. Other railway men suggested
the car shortage was caused by delay of shippers and railways in returning cars belonging
to other lines.
Inquiry among Des Moines coal dealers today brought out the surprising fact that only
one would attribute the high cost of coal to car shortage. The others would not state they
believed an actual shortage exists.

of Italian infantry are crashing
against the Austrian lines south oft

blows struck by General Cadorna
since Italy entered the war.
Following up their successes south
east of Goritz, the Italians have occu

heights near Kemperlisce. It was in
this region that the majority of the

IN THIRTY-TWO 'STATES
Estimated That One-Third" of the Vot

the United States Have
Seen Presidential
Nominee^
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
HUDSON, N. Y., Nov. 3.—By the
time Charles EJ. Hughes reaches New
York City tonight, his tours for votes
completed, he will have traveled
close to 30,000 miles. Members of the
Hughes part? estimate he has been
seen by nearly cne third of the voters
of the United States In the most com
prehensive, nerve-racking oral mara
thon for votes any presidential candi
date has ever undergone. Save for
about twelve days, the republican nom
inee has been continuously traveling
and stamping since August 5th.
He has made speeches in thirty-two
of the forty-eight states and passed
through two or three more without
talking. He has been as far north as
Bangor, Maine as far south as Nash
ville, Tenn. as far west as
ciflo slope. For the mbst part he has
traveled on the first campaign special
de-luxe ever Introduced in American
politics. He finishes his campaign tour
in perfect physical trim.
"Governor Hughes Is splendidly
fit," said his physician, Dr. Calllsoi.,
today. "There lsnt even any serious
ness to the condition of his larynx
from the tremendous strain he has put
on hlB voice. No man unless he is ab
solutely fit could have stood the strain
to Which the republican nominee has
been subjected and have finished in
the perfect condition of body and
nerves, that Governor Hughes has."
•Hughes has made abotrt five hun
dred speeches in the twelve aard
one-half "weeks during which he has
been actively campaigntnig. Ho has
spoken perhaps two million words of
argument—which averages sirty«ix
words to each traveled mile.
Throughout the 30,000 nrfles and
within sound of his voice on about
495 of the 500 speeches, has been
Mrs. Hughes—the gwvernor^s advisor,
his critic, the governor's boss, when
it came to ordering rest, and last of
all his most enthusiastic booster.
Mrs. Hughes has left a trail of but
tons across the entire nation and has
shaken Jnst as many hands and pat
ted Just a« many babies' heads as her
husband.
The candidate psxtkmlairtBsd on
commercial conditions here and
abroad after the war In. his speech
here: He quoted again from the
speech
of Chairman Hurley of the
federal trade commission on the
need for combating European rivalry
at the close of tihe struggle.
"I agree with Hmrley as to the
necessity for organization and ef
ficiency," he said. "Bat he stops,
short of a full conclusion, which it
seems to me, he should have reached
because we may have a very high de
gree of efficiency and we should de
velop it to the utmost and we may
have the best possible organization
and we should far more than we have
done to encourage it and still we may
not be able to compete with EJorope
where there Is at 'least equal organ­
isation and equal efficiency."
