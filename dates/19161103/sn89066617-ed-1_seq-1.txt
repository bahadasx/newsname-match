HUGHES ANSWERS
WILSON IN DASH
OVER N. Y. STATE
Says President's Record Is
Open for Criticism, if He
Has Made Mistakes.
GREAT CROWDS GREET
CANDIDATE ON TOUR
Declares He Will Carry New York
and Ohio at Next Tues
day's Election.
Special Dispatch to The Triune.
Albany, X. Y.f Nov. 2. Charles
Evans Hughes dashed through the
State, on his final appeal to the Xew
York voters today and was greeted
with immense crowds in every city and
hamlet. Every village through which
his train passed had been elaborately
decorated with flags and bunting, and
the candidate was given an enormous
reception, j
Thousands were at every station that
the candidate's train passed. He an
swered President Wilson's criticism of
bringing the Government's foreign re
lations into politics. Hughes declared
that as this country chooses a new
President every four years, the peo
ple had a right to discuss and even
agitate the measures passed by the
out-going administration as well as the
country's diplomatic relations.
"If the President has bungled his
work, he is open to criticism," declared
the Republican nominee. A President's
record must stand on its own leg?,
ft cannot hide behind the theory that
what is done by the executive and his
advisers is nobody's business but their
own."
"I have returned from a trip through
Ohio and Indiana," he said, with a
profound sense of gratification and en
tire confidence with respect to the re
sult in both states. I am not uneasy
as to what New York will do.
"In both Ohio and Indiana, it is not
exaggerating to say, I had receptions
which perhaps exceeded those accord
ed to any other presidential candidate.
That was, of course, as I said last
night, not a tribute to me personally,
but it was indication of the deep in
terest the people are taking in the
essential conditions of their prosperity
and their satisfaction that there is a
great reunited Republican party ready
for service at this critical time.
"So far as promises go, no one can
exceed the promises of our opponents,
but we measure what they say by
what they have done."
Hughes assailed the Democratic par
ty for failure to reduce the high cost
of living, "as promised four years
ago," and for extravagance.
"They tell us now," he c6ntinued,
"that tiny are going to deal with eco
nomic problems that confront us at
this time in a satisfactory manner, but
if we endeavor to ascertain by what
principle they are to be guided, we
look in vain. I propose to tell you by
what principles we shall be guid 'd."
Hughes then reiterated the policies
which he intends to follow if elected.
Hughes made five speeches in In
diana yesterday in winding up his cam
paign in the Middle West. The last
was to a crowd which filled the Wig
wam at Terre Haute, and followed a
long parade which the candidate re
viewed. Hughes devoted much of his
speeches yesterday to the tariff is
sue, declaring that the Underwood bill,
if allowed to remain in effect after the
war, would produce souphouses and
bread lines. He discussed the Adam
son bill at length in his night address,
declaring that while he understood.
union labor had been told officially to
vote for Wilson, he knew nobody could
direct or control the labor vote, and
that it would be cast according to its
sober judgment.
FORDHAM TO HAVE
ITS OWN "PLATTSBURG
New York, Oct. 2. Fordham Uni
versity, in this city, is to establish a
summer military training camp pat
terned after the Plattsourg institution,
if President Mulry obtains the consent
of the trustees. Dr. Mulry is a tearty
advocate of preparedness. The camp
will be open to any college student.
Although Fordham is inside this
metropolis, it is able to assign twenty
acres exclusively to the camp, besides
giving the rookies the use of eighty
acres more of the college camtus. Un
less something unforseen prevents, the
camp will start next June.
MAN IS KILLED
IN A QUARREL
OVER A $1-FEE
City Marshal at Walnut Ridge
Shoots Resturant Owner
in Back.
WANTED TO COLLECT
ON AN IMPOUNDED HOG
Bullets Break Spine-Sherfff Ar
rests Marshal and Mob
is Rumored.
As the result of a quarrel over a
$1 impounding fee for a hog owned by
a restaurant man in Walnut Ridge,
Ark., the city marshal there Wednes
day morning shot and killed the res- .
taurnantcur instantly. The marshal,
according to the story of the shoot
ing that was brought to the Cape yes
terdjy by members of the Frisco train
crews, was placed under arrest and
there was danger of a mob forming to
take him from the hands of the sheriff.
Walnut Ridge is a small town a mile
on the other side of Hoxie on the Fris
co. The city has a new stock law
which has been in eiTect but a few
weeks. It provides for taking all ani
mals that stray on the public roads or
streets to the pound and a fee of $1
is exacted in order that the owner may
obtain them.
A hog belonging to the restaurant
proprietor, whose name was not learn
ed, escaped from its pen Wednesday.
The marshal saw the animal on the
street, but a short time later, the 1!
year old son of therestauranteur start
ed in pursuit.
The boy caught the hog and started
driving it homeward, when Le was ac
cost2d by the marshal who claimed the
$1 impounding fee. The boy told the
marshal that his father would have
to settle the fee.
The marshal thereupon went to the
father, a man about OS years old. and
asked for the fee. The old man re
fused to pay. A quarrel resulted and
the old man turned his back upon the
marshal and stalled to walk away.
He had taken but a few steps when
the marshal drew his revolver and
fired point blank at the old man. The
victim fell to the ground and by the
time anyone reaclfrd his side, he was
dead.
One of the bullets struck his back
bone between the shoulder blades and
came out of his chest. The other bul
let penetrated at the back of his neck
and came out at tie tljroat. Roth bul
lets had broken his spinal column.
A short time after the shooting, the
sheriff arrested the marshal to hold
him for the Coroner's jury. The mar
shal about three weeks ago, it was re
ported, s'hot and killed a negro.
C. F. CRFAVS HOMESTEAniXG
Boatman Caes to Leranta, Ark., to
Get Swamp Land from (iot ranicnt.
C. V. Crews, the boat man who, for
many seasons operated the motor boat
that plies in the passenger trade be
tween the Cape and Thebes, for the
last month has been homesteading a
quarter section of land in Southwest
ern Arkansas, it was learned yester
day. He now is located at Lepanta, Ark.,
and his homestead is located about 20
miles from the town. He has to travel
overland by wagon in order to reach
his place.
The place that he is obtaining from
the Federal Government under the
homestead rights is a valuable piece
of swamp land which, when he obtains
title, will be worth several hundred
dollars.
As a part of the homesteading, he is
required to live for a part of each
year for five consecutive years on the
place and make certain improvements
on the farm. In his absence from the
Cape, his' sons will continue to op
erate the R. C. until ice forces them
to put the boat in dry dock.

If it decided that the lack of time
for preparation of floats for the parade
will make it impossible to have that

will be centered upon their individual
co-operation with the celebration in
the way of store decorations. The
merchants as individuals expect to
have extra electrical displays in any
event, for that week.
Mr. Tin.-lry and Mr. Waddington, a
member of the Socieyt of Electrical !

The milling on the edge of the coin

the background of the coin and at the
edge, the surface of the coin also is
