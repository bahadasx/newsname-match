IS FIRST TO DIE
i
\ Death Visits Carolina Force at El
Paso?Noncommissioned Officer of
1 Union Company, First Regiv
ment, is Typhoid Victim.
3 Yesterday brought the first death
among the South Carolina troops on
6 the border. Sergt. .1. I. Blalock,
- Company E (Union), First South Carolina
infantry, died at 8 o'clock >esterday
morning in the base hospital at
Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas, according
to a telegram received in Columbia.
. His mother, Mrs. M. M. Railey, lives
in Columbia, at 903 First street, Elmwood
park,
j. Sergt. Blalock died of typhoid, the
message received in Columbia said.
He had been promoted from corporal
"* since leaving the mobilization camp
at Styx, near Columbia, August 7,
" for Texas. The commander of his
company is Capt. J. F. Walker, Jr.,
son of J. Frost Walker, clerk of court
for Richland county. Mr. Blalock was
' a machinist and was working at that
trndp in Union whpn hi>j enmiinnv uraa
called into service. His comrades
found him a pood soldier and believed
^ his promotion well deserved. A friend
in Columbia said yesterday that he
developed typhoid a fortnipht apo
} and was transferred to the >vell equipped
base hospital so soon as it was
s realized that he was seriously ill.
e The health record of the South Care
olina troops on frontier duty has been

^ The body will arrive in Union Sat'

be at 11 o'clock Sunday morninp in
; OF UNION COUNTY |
you took; and I, your chairman, shall
not believe any white Democrat of
Union county who participated in the
primary election of Union county last
summer will violate such an oath and
pledge until I have actual proofs
What reason would you assign to
justify such an act? Why should you
do it? Do you know of any fraud
committed at any precinct by the
managers of our primary election?
any at your precinct? No, you do not
and never heard of any and there was
none. You know your own managers,
your own neighbors appointed by the
executive committee of your own club,
and you furthermore know they fairly
conducted the elections, made an honest
count and swore solemnly to the
correctness of their returns. You
made nO charge of fraud, no protest,
no contest and there was none
throughout Union cnnntv in ni<li.>>
primary.
As chairman to whom all the managers
and committeemen reported. I
jJtiArd of none and declare to you
[there was not a single protest, con'test
or claim of fraud filed with me.
j Then why scratch the Democratic
official ticket or bolt the party l>y
voting a ticket not official ?
I prepared the official Democratic
[ticket to be voted in each township
in Union county, and it has as Us
head Richard I. Manning for go\ ernor,
and the name of your township commissioner
at its foot, and any other
ballot is not and cannot be tiie Democratic
official ballot in the township.
Let woe be unto the white man or
set of white men, who by scratching
th2 party ticket or voting other than
the official party ticket, helps, aids
ar.d encouivges in making any iss.ns
among our race in this county and
State, and after succeeding drives the 1
wedge which will split assunder the
white voters of this county and State.
If you contemplate such, my brother,
you know what you do. If we have
grievances amongst us, why cannot
white men, as white men, reconcile
them among white men, without laying
the foundation for an appeal to the
negro? Would it not be wiser "To
bear the ills we have (if we have ,
them) "than fly to those we know not
gStandh ffoar and be- true to your oath
tO^your race, true to
fyour official political party, and the
iiTiiivv wunmii una me wnite girl will
Utill have whiter and fairer future to
Book to, if she continues here.
I Do nothing on November 7th that
|"f>u will regret in the future or
might bring calamity to your race.
If your stomach be too weak to
swallow the nominees, don't scratch
the ticket or bolt your party?go
hunting and forget the election.
I believe in your honor and integrity
and shall never waiver.
Yours for continued white supremacy,
undivided in perpetua.
Macbeth Young,
Chairman Democratic Executive Committee
Union County.

The Suburban Home of Mr. J.

a Pretty Wedding, When His
Daughter, Miss Oressa, Became
the Bride of Mr. David
H. Gentry, of Greenville.
<
The lovely suburban home of Mr.
and Mrs. J. A. Wilburn was the scene
of a quiet but very impressive wedding
on Saturday, October 28th, when
their youngest daughter, Oressia, became
the bride of Mr. David Homer
-r n mi
I \icuii j, ui ureenviue.
The wedding was the culmination of
a romance which began several years
ago when the bride was a student at
G. W. C., and the words which united
these lives for weal or woe, were spoken
by Rev. Lewis M. Rice, a life-long
friend of the bride, assisted by Rev. /
R. G. Lee, of Waterloo.
Mrs. Gentry is a young woman of
many accomplishments, possessing a
sunny disposition and admirable practical
qualities?this enviable combination
endearing her to a legion of
friends and admirers. The only note
of sadness on this festive occasion was
the fact that she will make her home
elsewhere but hearty good wishes will
follow her.
Mrs. Gentry was attired in a suit of
midnight blue cloth trimmed in gray
fur, worn with a chic lace blouse and
a blue velvet hat.
Mr. Gentry is a prosperous young
business man of Greenville and is held
in the highest esteem by his associates.
Immediately after the ceremony a
sumptuous dinner was served the

HALLOWE'EN PARTY
AT READING ROOM
Tuesday evening at 7 o'clock there
glided into the reading room, fittingly
decorated with pumpkin lanterns
and black cats, a gruesome looking
flock of witches and ghosts who soon
proved themselves more hilarious than
spookey. Ring games, ridiculous contests
and much general fun-making
were thoroughly enjoyed by witches,
ghosts and mere human beings alike.
The Messrs. Brookshire contributed
no small part of the joy of the evening
with their stringed instrument
music?the light hearted, foot prancing
kind.
The ghosts and witches proved their
substantiality when the refreshments
?apples and peanuts?were passed
around in baskets and bags.
At 9 o'clock when mirth and frolic
were at their height, the doors were
flung open and "Home, Sweet Home"
I was played; regretfully the hint was
taken.
The Woman's club assures us there
are many more such pood times in
I store, for which we are duly thankful.
We feel that for the success of the
eveninp especial thanks are due Misses
Lake and Sartor and their respective
, committees iri decoration and entertainment

faithful officers who are: Mrs. W. J.
