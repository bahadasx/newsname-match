POLITICAL FORECAST
Made by Leaders of the Republ
ican Party in Arizona on Eve
of Election. Victory Certain.
"Governor Joseph H. Kibbev
will defeat Henry Ashurst for
the United States Senate and I
look for Charles Evans Hughes
to carry Arizona," said Allan B.
Jaynes, Republican National
Committeeman, in a statement
issued today. Ashurst has
been slipping rapidly for the
past two weeks and Governor
Kibbey has made tremenduous
gains. The great silent vote of
the state will be for Kibbey. He
has the confidence of all classes,
he is recognized as senatorial
timber, and the great masses of
voters know that he will do big
things for Arizona at Washington
He will get a tremenduous ma
jority in Maricopa County where
27 percent of the vote of the
state will be polled, and I expect
to see him carry Cochise and
other counties rated as strongly
Democratic.
"The election of Tom Camp
bell is now being conceded by
Democrats everywhere in the
state and I expect to see him
carry through most of the state
ticket.
"Wilson only received 316 ma
jority over Roosevelt and Taft in
Arizona in 1912. The voters of
the state are independent and
will show their independence on
election day."
"Tom Campbell is going over
and going strong," said Thos,
Maddock, Republican State
Chairman, in a statement issued
on the eve of election, "his ma
jority depending on the extent
to which the vote comes out but
it will run around 3000. The
reason for this is that the inde
pendent voters of the state re
cognize that five years tenure of
office is enough, and that the
time has come for a change. By
his clean campaign, Tom Camp
bell has won the confidence of
the electorate and convinced
them of his courage and inde
pendence. Now that Tom Camp
bell is safe, he should be given
support in the capital building.
The Republicans have nominat
ed splendid men for the other
state offices and they are deserv
ing of the support of the intelli
gent oitizenship of this state. If
the latter come out and vote as
they should, the victory will be
complete.
"I predict the election of Gov
ernor Kibbey as United States
Senator by a majority equal to
that of Tom Campbell. Arizona
needs more than an orator in the
United States senate where the
big men have always been the
workers and thinkers rather
than the talkers."
Prescott, Ariz., Nov. 2. Tom
Campbell will lead the Republ
ican ticket in Yavapai, his home
county, with a majority of 1000
or better.
Although this is Ashurst's
home county, Jos. H. Kibbey
stands high in this section, and
it would not surprise his friends
here to see him carry the county
by a safe majority.
In the Presidential fight, Re
publicans believe that Hughes
will carry the county, although
many Democrats who will split
their tickets for Kibbey and
Campbell with stay with their
party in the national fight.
Phoenix. Ariz. Nov. 2. Governor
Kibbey will lead the Republican
ticket in Maricopa County with a
majority variously estimated
from 3000 to 3500. Tom Camp
bell will come a close second and
many Democrats believe that he
will carry the county by 2500.
The strongest deflection from
the Democratic nominee for gov
ernor is in this county and Hunt
will be snowed under here.
Hughes will run third but is ex
pected to carry the county.
(Advertisement)
Florence, Ariz. Nov. 2. Both
Campbell and Jos. H. Kibbey
will carry Pinal County, Camp
bell leading the ticket with at
least 300 majority. Judge
Kibbey. who used to live in this
county, has many warm admir
ers here, and will receive a big
silent vote among the Democrats.
The race between Hughes and
Wilson in this county is neck and
neck, with Hughes the favorite.
Tucson. Arizona. November 2.
Charles E. Hughes will carry
Pima county by three hundred
majority while Tom Campbell
and Governor Kibbey will proba
bly get 500 or 600 majority. The
republicans lead slightly in the
registrations but many republi
cans registered as democrats to
vpte in the primary and practi
cally all of the independent vote
will go to these three candidates
who are also supported by scores
of strong Democrats, Wilson's
Mexican policy and the Hunt ad
ministration being very unpopu
lar in this county.
Bisbee, Arizona, November 2,
Jos. H. Kibbey, candidate for
U. S. Senator, will probably lead
the republican ticket in Cochise
county. Governor Kibbey stands
an excellent chance to carry the
county, while Chas. E. Hughes
will probably lead Wilson in this
county because of the unpopu
larity of the administration's
Mexican policy. Tom Campbell
is very strong in the northern
end of the county and will close
his campaign in Bisbee and
Douglas. Democrats concede
that Hunt's majority in Cochise
will be less than 500, while the
republicans are claiming the
county for Campbell.
Safford, Arizona, November 2.
Graham county will go republi
can this year. Hughes, Kibbey
and Campbell will all carry Gra
ham county. Campbell and Kib
bey will carry the county by
several hundred votes. The re
publicans have a complete organi
zation in Graham county this
year and are making a big fight
for the ticket. Governor Kibbey
has always been popular here.
Hunt has no standing in this
county which is Geo. Olney's old
home, and Campbell will get a
big democrat vote here.
Clifton. Arizona, November 2.
Tom Campbell and Governor
Kibby will carry Greenlee county.
The result of the presidential
race here is in doubt. Governor
Kibby has many warm friends
here while Hunt is popular with
only one class and the rank and
file of the voters are for Camp
bell. St. Johns, Arizona, November 2.
The result in Apache county
will be close but the outlook is
favorable for Kibbey, Campbell
and Hughes carrying the county
by a small margin.
Flagstaff, Arizona, November 2.
Tom Campbell will carry Co
conino county by a majority of
from 100 to 200, while Gov. Kib
bey and Chas. E. Hughes stand
an excellent chance to carry the
county by a small margin. Al
though this in the old home of
Senator Ashurst, Gov. Kibbey
has many warm supporters in
this county and will get a big
vote here.
Kingman, Arizona, November 2.
Mohave county is the demo
cratic stronghold and republicans
are conceding that it will go
against Kibbey, Campbell and
Hughes by 250 votes. Republi
cans here and at Oatman have
formed a strong organization
however, and hope to hold the
majority down below this.
Phoenix, Arizona, November 2.
The republican meeting at
Phoenix Tuesday night was held
in the high school auditorium.
On one side of the stage was a
large bust oí George Washington
(Advertisement)
"The Father of his country;" on
the other side of the 3tage was
a life-sized bust of Abraham
Lincoln. Beside the bust of
Washington was a card contain
ing these words. "We did not
rob the churches." By the bust
of Lincoln was another card, on
which these words were printed,
' 'We were not too proud to fight. ' '
Globe, Arizona, November 2.
Republicans concede that Hunt
will carry his own county but his
majority here is only placed at
250 by conservative ' republican
estimates. Tom Campbell is very
popular in the outlying sections
and he will get a very large vote
in Globe. Governor Kibbey will
probably lead the ticket in this
county and may carry it by a
substantial majority. Chas. E.
Hughes is very strong in this
county and will lead Wilson.
Nogales, Arizona, November 2.
Hughes, Kibbey and Campbell
will carry Santa Cruz county by
300 majority. Party lines are
not being drawn here. Hundreds
of Democrats will vote against
Wilson and for Kibbey on account
of the administration's Mexican
policy. Tom Campbell is exceed
ingly popular in Nogales and will
lead Governor Hunt in Santa
Cruz county.
Yuma, Arizona, November 2.
Since Tom Campbell's visit to
this county republicans are claim
ing the county for him. He
made a great impression here.
Yuma county is normally about
300 democrats but republicans
expect to overcome this majority.
Governor Kibbey's familiarity
with irrigation makes him a
popular candidate with Yuma
valley farmers and many demo
crats will vote for him. Wilson
will probably carry the county
by a small margin.

A Blanket Size Ballot
The ballot that will be used by
the voters of Arizona in the
election next Tuesday is a blanket
size affair. While it is large
and unwieldy, and will require
some little time to mark, it is
simple enough to vote. The
main thing is for each voter to
allow himself or herself sufficient
time in which to mark the ballot
carefully.
In order to vote a straight
party ticket it is only necessary
for the voter to mark a cross in
the large square at the head of
the ticket favored. However,
such a cross will not count a vote
for any candidate for justice of
the supreme court, or for mem
ber of the state tax commission.
To vote for candidates for these
positions it is necessary to place
a cross after the name of the
candidate favored for each of
these positions. These names
will be found immediately above
the various party tickets.
The News does not believe that
many people in this county will
vote straight party ticket. And
we believe that this is well. Uld
party lines have been eradicated
by the passage of time, and
party designations mean but
little. It is the character and
fitness of the men and women
who are seeking the office that
should determine the voters'
choice when the ballot is marked.
Every voter has an idea which
one of the several candi
dates for the office they seek in
state and county is best fitted
for the office. He or she can
make no grievous mistake in
following this standard of selec
tion. By so doing it is practically
certain that the best people will
be chosen for the offices.
Go to the polls early and have
your minds, made up as to the
candidate? u expect to vote
for. When you enter the voting
booth place a cross after the
name of each person you favor,
beginning at the top of the bal
lot. A few moments is all that
is required, and you will not only
have done your duty as a citizen,
but you may rest assured that
you have selected the best people
for the offices.
Arizona's Next Governor
Notwithstanding the fact that
each of the state chairmen is
claiming a big majority for his
party's candidate for governor
next Tuesday, the fact remains
that neither the election of Gov
ernor Hunt, the democratic nom
inee, nor of Tom Campbell, the
republican nominee, is a certain
ty. The race is anybody's at
this time and it will be close
until the polls close Tuesday
evening.
Campbell has been gaining
during the last few weeks, and
he has a good chance of election.
On the other hand, Governor
Hunt's machine is working nicely
and his supporters are claiming
his re-election by a safe majority.
Outside of partianship "nan
compared to man The News be
lieves that Campbell is the better
fitted for the high office of chief
executive. He is the bigger of
the two men mentally as well
as physically and if these quali
ties count for anything he will
be elected governor.
The Next President
Who will receive a majority of
the votes for president next
Tuesday is a difficult thing to de
cide at this time. We do not be
lieve that even a good guess can
be made until after the ballots
are counted. There is but one
question to be decided by the
voters, as we view it. That ques
tion is "Has Wilson made good?"
If a majority of the voters
think the president has made
good, he will be re-elected. If
a majority think that the presi
dent has not made good, Mr.
Hughes will be our next presi
dent. My house in Holbrook for sale
or rent. Write me for terms or
prices. Jesse Hulet, Navajo,
Arizona.
Vote for Paulsell and Freeman
A vote for two democratic can
didates for county supervisor
next Tuesday is a vote for an
efficient, economical and business-like
administration of county
affairs for the next two years.
R. C. Creswell, the holdover
member of the board, is a man
of recognized integrity and busi
ness ability, and he should be
supported in his efforts to give
the county a business adminis
tration by the election of the
best men available.
The best men available, and
there are no better men in the
county, are J. C. Paulsell and
John Freeman. These men
possess high character, strict
integrity and splendid business
ability. Their election will place
the county's business affairs in
the hands of a board of supervi
sors against which no legitimate
criticism can be made.
Vote next Tuesday for Paulsell
and Freeman, and thereby vote
for a safe and sane administra
tion of county affairs.
New Business Firm
In another column of this paper
appears the display advertise
ment of a new firm which has
just opened for business in Hol
brook. The style of the firm is
Henderson & Bundy, and they
will engage in the contracting
and engineering business, and
will make plans, specifications
and estimates on all kinds of con
struction work.
The senior member of the firm
is M. r. Henderson, who has
been engaged in the contracting
business in Holbrook for the
past two years. During that
time he has constructed a num
ber of handsome buildings, and
is now finishing the Masonic
temple here. He is a man of
energy and ability and has made
a success in his profession.
The other member of the firm
is D. L. Bundy, who for many
years prior to his coming to Ari
zona was chief draughtsman in
the state engineer's office of
Colorado at Denver. He is ex
perienced in his line of work and
enjoys an enviable reputation in
Colorado for efficiency.
The News bespeaks for this
new firm a profitable business.
Assured of Victory
The democratic county candi
dates came in to Holbrook yester
day afternoon from the southern
part of the county, where they
had been conducting a strenuous
campaign lor ten oays. last
night they went to Woodruff
where they held a meeting, with
a dance aiterwaros. lonignt
they go to St. Joseph and will be
in Holbrook tomorrow night. A
meeting will be held in the
Pastime theater here.
Every person who made the
trip is enthusiastic over the re
ception accorded the candidates
in the different localities visited,
and each is satisfied that the
voters will return a handsome
majority for the entire demo
cratic ticket at the polls next
Tuesday. So far as the county
ticket is concerned there is but
little doubt that the democrats
will elect every candidate on it.
This ticket, taken as a whole,
is far better than the republican
ticket, and the voter can not go
far wrong by putting a cross
after every person on it. The
democratic ticket is printed in
the left hand column on the bal
lot. If you are in doubt how to
marK your ballot, just start at
the top of the column and place
a cross after the name of everv
person whose name appears in
the column, from top to bottom,
and let it go at that.
F. H. Hathorn, who started
the Old Trails Tire Repair shop
in Holbrook several months ago.
has sold an interest in his busi
ness to E. H. Burke. The firm
is now Hathorn & Burke, and
the location is the same as be
fore. From the day Mr. Hathorn
started the business it has pros
pered, and it will no doubt con
tinue to do so.
Notice to Parents and Teachers
Owing to the number of acci
dents to pupils caused by the use
of the swing and slide apparatus
on the school grounds, it has
been decided to discontinue the
use of the swings and slides for
the present.
If it is found later, that the
apparatus can be arranged dif
ferently so that there will be
less likelihood of accidents re
sulting from its use, this may be
done. For the present, the par
ents and teachers are asked to
aid us in preventing further acci
dents by instructing the childrei
to refrain from using the play
device in its present condition.
