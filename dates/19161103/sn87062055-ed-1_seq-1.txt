HITCHCOCK CLAIMS
VICTORY JR HOGHES
Frank H. Hitchcock, former chair
man of the republican national com
mittee and a member of tho advisory
committee of the present campaign,
issued a prediction regarding the out
come of the election, basing his con
clusions on reports received from ex
perienced political leaders in each of
. the states concerned. His statement
is as follows:
"Hughes will be elected on Novem
ber 7. He will carry the following
states, having an aggregate electoral
vote of 308, or forty-two in excess of
the required 66: Maine, 6; New
IHampshire, 4; Vermont, 4; Massa
chusetts, 18; Rhode Island, 5; Con
necticut, 7; New York, 45; New Jer
sey, 14; Pennsylvania, 38; Delaware,
3; West Virginia, 8; Indiana, 15; Il
linois, 29; Michigan, 15; Wisconsin,
13; Minnesota, 12; Iowa, 13; North
Dakota, .6; South Dakota, 5; Kansas,
10; Wyoming, 3; Idaho, 4; Utah, 4;
New Mexico, 3; Washington, 7; Ore
gon, 5; California 18.
"He will probably carry also Ohio,
24; Nebraska, 8, and Colorado, 6,
making his total 346, or a majority of
80.
"He has a good prospect of carry
ing in addition certain so-called
doubtful states with an' aggregate
vote of 49, as follows: Maryland, 8;
Kentucky, 13; Missouri, 18; Montana,
'4; Nevada, 3, and Arizona, 3.
"This would give him a total vote
of 895, or a majority of 129."
MANGLED IN MILL BELT
DIES FOLLOWING DAY
Juan Majarro, a young Mexican
, boy working at the box factory of the
A. L. & T. company mill, was ncci
dently caught in one of the belts run
ning the machinery last week Thurs
day afternoon and so badly injured
that he died the following day at the
Milton hospital. ,
One arm was cut off and he received
bruises about the body and internal
injuries from which he did not rally.
- The funeral was held Saturday at
the Catholic church. There was a
goodly attendance of friends and fel
low employees who felt deep sympa
thy for the unfortunate young man
so suddenly deprived of life.
W. F. STUART OPERATED
ON FOR APPENDICITIS
W. F. Stuart, the photographer,
who recently went to El Paso on a
business trip was suddenly taken ill
and was operated upon for appendi
citis. The operation was a success
ful one and while recovering from the
affects of it, was compelled to under
go another minor operation, and is
at present in the hospital doing as
well as could be expected.
Mrs. Stuart has taken up her re
sidence with Mrs. A. J. Sullivan, East
Birch avenue, during Mr. Stuart's ab
'sence. J. C. Brown Receives Bad News
J. C. Brown, who recently returned
from a trip to Camden, N. J., where
he was called by the serious illness of
his father, was informed by wire
Saturday morning that his father had
passed peacefully away. Some few
people of Flagstaff will remember the
iather, an intellectual gentleman, who
visited his son here a few years ago;
he had for thirty years held the posi
tion as professor of manual arts in
the Camden schools. Mr. Brown was
, unable to go cast to attend the fune
ral. Those who met the father while
'in Flag8taff,..wiU deeply regret tho
passing of a noble soul, into the great
beyond and sympathize with the son
who grieves In his loss.
Judge Anderson Is Busy Working
Police Judge Anderson keeps grind
ing out cases in his rourt and always
has his scales balanced for the next
case.
Monday he had a Mexican up for
directing a big six pistol straight at
,the middle of Paul Keller, but his
nerve failed him when it came to pull
ing the trigger. He was assessed
$100 or 100 days for packing thofgun
around.
Night Marshal Wick Thompson
gathered up another Mexican who
had offered to spoil his clothes with
a long, ugly, looking knife and pos
Jslbly dig into his inner wrappings. He
was handed a similar package with
the same opportunity.
Aha, Mr. White You're Caught
H. B. White and wife came down
vfrom Flagstaff Sunday in their auto-,
mobile. They will visit different parts
of the country before returning home.

COCONINO WATER COMPANY
APPLY FNH11E PERMIT
The Coconino Water .Development &
Stock Company has filed a petition
with the Commission asking that a
Certificate of Convenience and Neces
sity bo granted it to exercise the
functions of a public corporation in
tho distribution of water. The pro
moters of the company have been en
gaged for the past two years in devel
opment andexperimcntal work. The
plans of the company" contemplate
collecting waters from the Sna Fran
cisco Mountains near Flagstaff, con
ducting some to natural reservoirs
formed by craters, empounding the
water in such reservoirs and supply
ing consumers by gravity pipe lines.
It proposes to supply water at Grand
Canyon, Ash Fork, Seligman, King
man and other points now without
water in Northern Arizona. Ash Fork
and Grand Canyon are now supplied
by having water hauled by the rail
road. Kingman secures its supply
from wells, but has no water com
pany. The Coconino Company has
found by test that a great quantity of
water that now runs off of the San
Francisco Peaks and is lost in the
surrrounding volcanic ash beds can be
conserved, and that the supply is suf
ficient to furnish "logging camps,
towns, stockmen and fanners in the
vicininty. Tho Commission has set
the application for hearing at Phoe
nix, November 3rd, at 10 o'clock a.

A new young lady was welcomed
at the home of Mr.
A M T H
Gill, on Observatory hill last Monday
morning, tipping the scales at seven
and one half pounds.
Mr. J. S. Kimscy, who is assisting
the Flagstaff Mercantile Co., with
their busy business, received word
that a most acceptable baby girl had
arrived at Niangua, Mo., on October
14th, and would soon be a resident of
Flagstaff.
Regardless of the English holding
up the U.S. letters, W.H. Switzer re
ports that a male boy, without har
ness, but all good hardware, was re
ceived at his home last Saturday, with
a tonnage of 9 pounds, and, pa isn't
"too proud to fight" if you tell him
it isn't one of the best boys brought
to town lately.
"Grandpa" Jim Byrom says he hard

is willing to accept the renewed in

a big ten pound gfrl who arrived at
John Byrom's home last Sunday.

calmly, but it is getting so you can

J. D. Dunn for County Assessor
J. D. Dunn, the present county as- j

nee without opposition for the place
this year, would especially appreciate
your votes notwithstanding the fact
that he has no opposition. He has en
deavored to the best of his ability to
give the people an honest admlnls,

same good service during the coming
two years. He advises that he is just
as earnestly desirous of your votes
as an expression of your good will, as
though ho had a candidate opposing
him.
John Flynn Operated

John Flynn, much better known
among his friends as "Shorty" Flynn,
was taken suddenly ill Sunday and
taken to the Milton hospital where he
was operated oh for appendicitis.
His numerous friends will be
pleased to know that the operation
was successful and that he was doing

CAN YOU CONCIEVE OF A SMALLER ROLE
FOR HUMAN TO CRAWL OUT OF IN A PINCH?
After Colonel Roosevelt said it was
a lie, and after his private secretary
said it was a bald-face lie, what
smaller hole could you expect one
to crawl out of than the following
cringing admissions that he had done
it for pay?
The flaring head line of the Leader
admitted that it had lied in this par
ticular instance, "but who would know
the difference, since it was reported
by some one who had heard come one
say something that the person re
porting the "fact" had heard some one
say, might be the facts, because he
had not heard some one else say that
they had not heard anything differ
ent." Roosevelt says the article was a lie
pure and simple.
Roosevelt's secretary says it is a
lie.
And in the article we quote, the
supposed "hearear" says in effect,
some one might have said it, and sug
gests that the people should always
keep their ears open when trains are
going by.
"The only thing further that The
Leader has to say today is that when
the Colonel is passing through the
sparsely populated sections of North
ern Arizona he should be more care
ful expressing his personal views on
Arizona and western political condi
tions, especially at this stage of a
campaign, for there are ears always
wide open, and Flagstaff people fre
quently traveling up and down the
Santa Fe between Phoenix and Flag
staff." Leader.
Even the Messenger, a rabid dem
ocratic paper published at Phoenix,
puts a head line over the fake article
"IS IT TOE TRUTH?"

FATHER AND SONS
RANQUET VERY
ENJOYABLE AFFAIR
The. next regular meeting of the
Men's Club of the Federated church
will be held on Thursday cveing, Nov
ember 9th, at eight o'clock, in the par
lors of the church. After the regular
business meeting a half hour will be
spent in the study of "Poverty and
Wealth." We hope for a good atten
dance from the regular members, and
invite others to pay us a visit.
The Fathers' and Sons' banquet,
given under the' auspices of the Men's
Club at the Commercial Hotel last
Monday evening, was attended by
fifty men. Addressed ere given by
Mr. W. H. Day, Interstate Yi M. C. A.
Secretary for Arizona and New Mex
ico, and western Texas; by Mr. Leo
nard Paulson of 'New York? Interna
tional Y. M. C. A. Secretary for Boys,
and by Dr. Blome and Prof. Walker
of the Northern Arizona Normal
School. Mr. Henry Smith of Flag
staff, favored the Club with a vocal
solo.
All those present at the banquet
seemed to agree with the speakers
that the time has come for Flagstaff
to get in touch with our neighboring
towns for the purpose of interesting
them in the movement of employing
a traveling Y. M. C. A. Secretary for
such a unit of territory as would al
low him to cooperate effectively with
local workers who may be interested
in the cause. Let us help Flagstaff
to join the front ranks in this move
ment to provide boys and young men
more effective character-building in
fluences for their leisure hours. Thos.

Preston's Big Truck Doing Road Work
The big truck owned by S. S. Pres
ton of Tuba, has been enlisted in the
good road work east of the city by
County Engineer Power, with W. S.
Beard doing the engineering of the
big machine. It is being used in haul
ing cinders and digging out the road
way in preparation for the top coats.

Lines.
tion in which it was printed) from
Flagstaff, must be possesed of a
dwarf t intellect. To attribute a state
ment of the kind to Colonel Roosevelt,
President Wilson, or any other man
of intelligence and standing, after
only spending a part of a .day and a
night in Arizona, needs -a guardian.
His brain is so small that it would
rattle around inside the shell of a
Mexican bean with as comparative
ease as would a No. 6 shot in a full
grown bass drum. Men of Colonel
Roosevelt's class are not given to such
fool breaks as the bonehead who orig
inated thefeFlag8taff telegram."
The main point of the whole thing
is. merely to call attention to, and
point out the difference between tell
ing the truth and the "handing out"
of something for the purpose of "just
fooling the public."
It was a grand stunt, but it was
one in which the "fool' 'who attempt
ed to "fool" was the worst fooled, for
the most people believe that a "square
deal" is the best part of the play re
gardless of politics.
A LIE WELL LIED IS WORTHY
OF THE HIRE OF THE LIAR
Really, it is the first time we ever
heard of a fellow being "caught with
the goods" calling it a "boomerang;"
he might have been the boomerangee's
or an orangoutang, or a log tailed
rat, but the durned "boom" seemed
to have "rang-ed" and de-ranged the
fellow who attempted to boom it,
judging from the amount of space
used in attempting to explain an ex
planation that fully proved the ex
planation had only one solution the
boy failed to sec the wolf. Notoriety
of that kind is not sought by any self
resecting newspaper, even though it
may advertise the sheet. If such
stuff would change a vote, Arizona
will go democratic safejy forever.
Just to be sporty, we are willing to
wager $1.13 that if there is a dem
ocrat elected in Arizona) or Coconino
county next Tuesday that it can not
bo traced to the Leader's door.
AN ABSOLUTE LIE,,
ASSERTS ROOSEVELT
OF FAKE INTERVIEW
Replying to an alleged inter-
view with him at Flagstaff, pub-
5 lished by the Phoenix Gazette, in
which he was quoted as saying
that Arizona would go for WiN

! from Denver the following tele-
5 gram to Allan B. Jaynes, Rcpu-
blican National ommittceman: v
"Allan B. Jaynes,

"THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
At Douglas Saturday night,
answering hecklers, who asked
him why Wilson had not protect-
ed Americans in Mexico, Senator
? Ashurst said that more Ameri-
cans were killed in Mexico dur-
ing Roosevelt's administration
than during Wilson's regime.
Prominent Newspaper Man Here
Mr. Cadwallader Washburn, cousin
of former Mayor Washburn of Chi
cago, and a nephew of C. B. Wash
bum, secretary of state under Grant's
administration, arrived in Flagstaff
last week. He will go to Tuba and
from there north into the reservation
country on a tourist trip of a month
or more. Mr. Washburn, though deaf
and dumb, is a most interesting per
son to meet and a newspaper man
and writer of fine ability, fully con
versant with every thing of interest
going on in the country today. In
"speaking" of the Sun plant, said:
"you have a bigger plant than the
"Royal Gazette' 'at Bermuda, which
was established over 165 years ago.
Mr. Washburn left this week for
Tuba.
Colorado Falling
The river is subsiding rapidly and
the ferries could run now if the road
on the Arizona side was in condition
for travel. It is expected, that the
road to the Arizona side landing' will
be repaired within a week and direct
traffic with Oatman resumed. The
channel during the last raise seems
to be changing toward the Arizona

FLAGSTAFF TO LOSE MAYOR
POPULAR SANTA FE AGENT
Mayor O. HjJohn of the city of
Flagstaff and the popular Santa Fe
station agent, announced the first of
the week that he had handed in his
resignation to take effect on Decem
ber 1st, next.
His resignation will come as a sup
rise to his many friends here who
thoroughly believe that he has been
one of the best station agents Flag
staff ever had. He brought about n
great many changes for the good of
the people as well as for the benefit
of the railroad company, which will
be of lasting benefit to both.
The business of the Flagstaff sta
tion has grown to enormous propor
tions since he came here, both by
reason of the natural growth of the
town and because of his untiring en
ergy in looking after the wants and
needs of the patrons of the road. The
old time ill feeling toward, the rail
road company because of past differ
ences has cleared away.
As an evidence of his popularity
and confidence in his honesty and
ability, he was elected Mayor of Flag
staff by a good substantial' majority,
the candidate receiving the most.votes
being accredited that honor by the
other members elected.
Mr. John has a large ranch down iv
Texas and his present intentions are
to move down there and look after
his land interests.
The people of Flagstaff will regret
to learn of his decision, but their
good wishes will go with him to his
new home.
EDITOR FLEMING SAND-
BAGGED AT NEEDLES
Editor Fleming of the Needles Nug
get was sand-bagged last week and
laid up unconscious for some hours
by some one who was supposed to be
politically opposed to him, and the
things he was advocating in his paper
in the present most vigorous cam
paign. The editor of the Sun has been ad
vised that he is to receive the same
sort of treatment during the latter
hours of election day so that it could
have no political effect to be done
by a friend, of a friend, you see. Hav
ing purchased a game license, we are
willing to go up or down the line
from garret to celler. A skunk can
rib up a row that a real white man
does not want to go near, but he may
have the courage to walk through the
stink to stop the stinker.
PERSECUTION OF RUNKE
STILL GOES MERRILY ON
The persistent system of persecu
tion inaugurated against Supt Walter
Runke of the Tuba Indian schools,
seems to go merrily on, with the evid
ent purpose of "putting him out of
business."
He went to Prescott on Saturday
where he had been called before the
U. S. Commissioner on charges of
purjury preferred by the U. S. attor
ney, purporting to be relative to a
letter writen during the time of the
Taddy Tin trouble.
The hearing was postponed until
Monday; Monday the hearing was
again called without the appearance
of the attorneys for the prosecution,
it was postponed twice the same day
without getting a hearing until final
ly tho U. a. commissioner new a son
of an informal hearing, then reserved
his judgment until he could get into
communication with the U. S. Attor
ney. It is great amusement when the
government has to pay the freight
for one side but not for the individual
has to put up his own money and time
to find out why he is disliked.
It would seem that outright "heck
eling" would be better and cleaner
sport.
COFFIN'S BRANCHING OUT
Details of a deal for the sale of the
Jerome Transfer company to George
Coffin and Will Coffin of Phoenix are
now being arranged. If there is no
hitch the Coffins will take over the
transfer comany, its business, roper
ty, stock and equipment, from Charles
Ewing an,d Charles E. Hughes, on
November 1.
George Coffin, head of -the Light
ning Delivery company, at Phoenix,
arrived in Jerome last Sunday. He
left Monday, having reached an
agreement with Ewing and Hughes,
who have decided to devote their
time to other interests.
Will Coffin is to be the local man
ager of the Jerome Transfer company
under the new ownership. The Cof
fins expect gradually to add auto
trucks to the equipment and branch
out in other ways. Jerosae News.

Of course we ain't got no gun on,

from Arizona papers, but failed to

Pollock Says Campbell Will Win
T. E. Pollock, who recently returned
from" Phoenix, says: "I believer that
Tom Campbell is a sure winner over
Hunt from all I heard while down at
Phoenix and if there is as much
Campbell feeling in the southern part
of the state, he will win by a much
larger majority than the republicans
are claiming for him now. Tho change
to Campbell since I was there before
looks like a landslide in his direction.
Coconino county should give him at
least 100 majority, if not more."
