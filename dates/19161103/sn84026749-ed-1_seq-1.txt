Kenyon Resolution for Investi
gation With Reference to
Wage Earners to Be Pressed
PART OF HIGH FOOD PROBE
Officials Hope Move Will Serve
to Check Alleged Price
Manipulation.
An imestlgatlou Into tho cost of liv
ing In the District of Columbia, with
special lefcrenco to wage earners, prob.
ably will bo under way before tho
year ends.
Inasmuch, as everybody Is talking
about the high, and increasing, cost
of living, this investigation promises to
bo of cxtrcmo Importance.
Officials of the Consumers' League
of the District of Columbia today said
they hoped to sco the Inquiry under
way in a comparatively short time.
The last session of Congress nctod
on the matter by passing a resolution
through both houses for an Investiga
tion to bo conducted by tho Depart
ment of .Labor and appropriating $6,00)
for it.
' Changed in Senate.
The House resolution was amended
In tho Heinto and Congress adjourned
beforo the House agreed to tho Senate
amendment. It Is expected, however,
that aoon after Congress meets the reso
lution wlJl bo finally disposed of, and
that the probe will follow In a short
time.
The tesolutlon In duration Is one for
which Senator Kenyon has worked for
several years. In the House last ses
alon Congressman Keating of Colorado
urgca it.
. The results of the Investigation will
havo at least a two-fold importance.
They will shed light on the general sub
ject of coat of living, and they will
show whether working girls and work
ing women aro being adequately paid.
Views of League.
Officials of tho'Consumers' League of
the District of Columbia aro convinced,
they say, that working girls und work
lug women are not adequately paid In
a largo proportion of cases.
If that Is demonstrated by figures
obtained by tho Federal Government,
they purpose to work for minimum
wngo legislation- for the National
Capital.
This will be done not nlono for Its ef
fects hero, but because It Is expected to
promoto tho cause of minimum wage
legislation nil over the country. It Is
especially desired that Stato legislatures
bestir themselves.
Tho Consumers' League has made no
thorough Investigation of what It costs
working girls and working women to
llvn here. A partial Inquiry was mado
Homo time ago by certain student In
vestigators, and this showed that the
cost of living for a working girl or
woman hero was a llttlo under $9 per
week. The league does not say the
llguro Is correct, but Its officials are
of the opinion that the cost of living
will be "found a good deal above the
average wage.
World Bad, But Not
Going to the Devil
Bishop Says We Still Have Hope
In Spite of Woman's
Filmy Frock.
MIIjWAUKEC, Nov. 3.-"We don't
bellove the world Is trowing worse and
going to the devil, even though tho
attire of our women as they walk the
streets does suggest that Satan rules,"
declared Bishop Charles 11. Mitchell at
the annual Mllwaukeo district clerical.
"There Is a difference betwen the
gown of beauty and that which Is a
lure to sin. Abbreviated skirts, low
necks, transparent filmy frocks may
be beautiful from the artistic stand
point, but tlicw aro abhorrent to tho man
of God, who sees that the designers
who devised such styles are patently
playing to human passion.
"It Is a pity that the rostumcr can
so pervert a beautiful design of a frock
Into one which hints only at evil."

FOOTING BILL OF
Former Senator Bourne Ex
plains Just Why Cost of Liv
ing Is So High.
FIGURES FROM GOVERNMENT
Statistics Given Out by Depart
ment of Commerce Show
Why Prices Are Soaring.
That the American people are
compelled to pay high prices for
foodstuffs and coal while these ar
ticles are being shipped to foreign
consumers at lower prices than
those? quoted in this country, is tho
charge made today by former Sen
ator Jonathan Bourne, president of
the Republican Publicity Associa
tion. Senator Bourne's statement is of
particular interest just now in view
of the widespread complaint of the
soaring cost of living.
He says:
PRICES LOWER.
"We ore shipping foodstuffs nnd coal
to foreign consumers at prices far lower
than those quoted at home. The Amer
ican people who are not participating In
war wages and war profits aro about
to face n winter with tho coat of living
higher than ever before In our history.
"Mcanwhllo tho Democrats, who camo
Into power on the promlso to reduce the
cost of living, nro making a prosperity

the feeders of the European armlet
baaed on tho falso plea that Wodrov.
Wilson brought about that prosperlu
and thatahe kept us out of a wnr with
which wo had no concern, but which
makes' possible the unstable prosperity
which wo now possess.
"The official figures of tho Deparf
ment of Commerce, which have belated
ly been made1 public, show that tin
prices which our peoplo havo to pay for
foodstuffs produced In this countrj
compared with the prices at which thoso
same articles are shipppod to our cus
tomers abroad, are outrageously high
nnd that a largo portion of tho AmerS
can public 'has to foot the prosperln
bill.
