THURSDAY BY
T. Y. Robins, v 40, '.' substantial
23rd District farmer, - and well
known in every section of Henry
and Benton counties, was shot
and instantly killed by his son-in-law,
Crawford Wynns, . about
6 o'clock , Thursday morning.
Wynn is under arrest. .
, Details of the shooting are
meager, but from what can be
learned it seems that the trouble
has been brewing for. the past
two or three years, and that it is
the outcome of a family feud.
From what could be learned it
seems that i Robbins had been
indicted in the; circuit court at
Paris by Wynns, and that Rob
bins had made threats on Wynns'
life for so doing.'' Robbins was
placed under bond ' to keep the
peace, but it is said that he made
the statement that he would
hoot Wynns on sight, and that
he had armed, himself for the
meeting. It is understood that
Robbins had been out of the
county for several weeks and
had -only returned the night
before the tragedy. i: j Y Yl
The killing occured . within a
quarter mile of Robbins' home
in the public road. ' It is sup
posed that the two men met and

SPEAKiiERE MONDAY
Hon. Hoy te Stewart, democrat,
statesman and orator, will ad
dress the voters of Henry county
at the courthouse in Paris next
Monday, November 6, at 1:00
o'clock. .
Mr. Stewart is one of the most
prominent politicians in the
state of Tennessee, having served
two terms in the state legislature
and two terms in the state sen
ate. He is speaking in the in
terest of the democratic ticket,
and everyone is urged to hear
him. 10 y.-ru-ii !;'?.

WARNING TO DEMOCRATS
President Wilson has appealed to the country to back
him with a Democratic Congress. This is absolutely neces
sary to continue the Wilson policies and should appeal ' to
every Democrat to lay aside personal predjudice and disap
pointments, and see that the vote of McKellar for the Sen
ate, and Sims for Congress is made as large as possible. It
is not a question of men, but measures. To elect a republican
congress would tie the hands of President Wilson and stay
progressive legislation. t
Mr. Rhodes, while a most excellent gentleman is the
regular nominee of the Republican party for congress and is
running as such and is committed to the policies of Mr.
Hughes and against those of Woodrow Wilson. L.
Henry county should take a pride in increasing the
majority of their fellow citizens, Governor Tom C, Rye, and
their local ticket. Burton. Tharpe and Reynolds.
We urge i that Democrats see that every Democratic
voter gets to the polls Tuesday, those having conveyances .
should not overlook this. Y -.-..
Information from a reliable' source is that the National
and State Republican Headquarters- have promised the
negro republicans the control of patronage, including the
appointment of post masters, Rural Route Carriers, Custom
officers, district marshall and his deputies in event of repub
lican success, ? - i ?
This secret and desperate effort to regain favor by bring
ing the southern negro back into politics, is an insult to the
southern people. It has its origin in the financial center of
Wall Street, which is willing to resort to any device to
thwart the purpose of President Wilson to retain for the
American people the control of their finances one of the
chief accomplishments of his administration and the basis of
our present prosperity. s - .
President Wilson stands for peace, with honor, while the
election of Hughes would unsettle conditions in anticipation
of the warlike attitude he is expected to assume.
Again we urge upon Democrats to be vigilant, see to it
that no fraudulant voting' is permitted and that the full
Democratic vote is polled in every precinct s -
henry .County Democratic Campaign Committee. .....

The daily papers of last Fri

correspondence from R. M.
Gates at Washington: '
"As . ranking member of the
House committee on interstate
and 'foreign commerce T. W.
Sims of the Eighth Tennessee
District has been selected as one
of the representatives of the
lower house on the commission
recommended by President Wil
son for' the investigation . and
study of the wages, working con
ditions, capitalization and other
economic phases of the railroad
question. The head of this com
mission, which will begin its in
vestigation in November, is Sen
ator Francis G. Newlands of Ne
vada, chairman of the Senate
committee on interstate com
merce. ; Upon the findings of
this commission the Congress is
expected to base future legisla
tion of vital concern to the rail
roads as well as the public. The
task set for the commission to
execute ia one requiring great
RAILROAD QUESTION

labor and skill and involving re-1
sponsibilities of vast importance.
The selection of Congressman
Sims for a place on this commis
sion closely identifies Tennessee
with an undertaking of national
scope and meaning. Wherefore
the re-election of Mr. Sims to
the House at this time is urgent
if Tennessee is to be represented
in the government's attempt at
solving a problem in which the
whole nation is interested. The
defeat of Congressman Sims
would deny Tennessee this im
portant representation, for the
work of the commission will con
sume two or three years, and if
he is not returned to the Con
gress his connection with it
ceases automatically. Congress
man Sims ranks next to Chair
man . Adamson on the House
committee on interstate . and
foreign commerce and he was
selected to serve with the chair
man on this commission because
of his intimate and thorough
knowledge of the subject matter
involved in the proposed investi
gation. Another reason for re
electing Congressman Sims as
well as all other Democratic
members of ttye House is
that the Democratic , majority
in the House is now only
26, and it is not certain that it
will not be reduced in the. com
ing election, although President
Wilson wins his re-election. As
a matter of fact, the president
is stronger than his party in
several doubtful states like Ohio,
Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan,
Minnesota, Kansas and Nebras
ka, and the Democrats will need
every member they now have to
insure the carrying forward of
President Wilson's progressive
policies. The Eighth - is the
closest ; Democratic, district in
Tennessee, especially in national
elections, and if Congressman
Sims is returned this year he
will need the ' support of every
Democrat in his district

No Need For Alarm On the
part Of The Farmers Of
The County
LOCAL BUfERS ARE IN THE
MARKET FOR COUNTY CROP
No Better Prices Can" Be Had
. At Mayfield Than In Y, ;
I Local Market
It is reported 'that several
loads of the 1916 crop of Henry -county
tobocco has been hauled "
to Mayfield, Ky., and sold on the
streets and that some of the
parties were very much dissatis
fied with the prices which they
received. ;
It is understood that some of
these parties reported to their
neighbors and others that they
received considerably more for
their tobacco than they were
really paid for it. It is said that
one party was so badly disap
pointed with the prices offered
that he unloaded his tobacco on
the loose floor and returned home
without making a sale.
It seems that if the price at V
Mayfield does not come up to the
expectations of those who visit
the market, they should give
their friends a true report of the
conditions and prices and save
them tbe ' disappointment which
they themselves have experieficvvv
ed. . ; ' v !:-'V ' t'yyy
The 1916 Henry county tobacco '
crop is unusually large and the
people should receive the highest
market price for it. It is said
that the three firms, E. J.
O'Brien & Co., Louisville; J. M.
Buckner & Co., New York, and
the Italian Regie are among the
largest handlers of dark firdd
tobacco, and that their agents
purchase about two-thirds of all
tobacco handled in Paducah and
Mayfield. These large operators .
are represented in this county by
their agents, and they state that ,
they are offering the same prices
which are being 'offered by the
agents at other points.
If this is true, it stands to
reason that the farmers 'will be
able to realize as much for their
tobacco at home as they can get
at a point 40 miles away from
home, provided they do not get
in too big a rush to dispose of
their crop, y , '
