HUGHESSEES
WILSON POLICY
AS A 'MUDDLE'
Denounces Adminis
tration's Course of
Petty Warfare
ALBANY G'VES
LIVELY WELCOME
Candidate Tells How He
Would Protect Busi?
ness and Labor
[*>aaa a stair r/xnui-... laal afl Th* Mboaaa "
Albany, Nov. 2. Charles E. Hughes
characterized the Wilson administra?
tion to-night aa "a muddle of meddle."
His answer to President Wilson's pro
te-stations against any political criti
cism flf the Administration's foreigr.
policy was the severest arraignment of
that policy that Mr. Hughes has voiced
m the whole campaign. I'pstate New
Yorser. roare.l their approval.
"America must not be misrepresent
ed." declared Mr. Hughes. "Wa are
not a decadent people. There would be
no prosperity for thc Vnited States ifl
we lost our self-respect. There is noth- ;
,n(f n, it' to the m.intenar.ce
of our peace than that we should s.afe
guard the rights of Ameriean citizens
throughout the world.
"It Ifl not that we should be trucu- i
lent," Mr. Hughes asserted. Then.;
pick.ng out one of President Wilson's ,
pet expressions, he added, "It Ifl not
that we should er.gage ifl blustering.
1 like the phrase. 'the peace of a gen
tleman,' but it is the peace of a gen
tleman unafraid, alert in his self
?t, and getting his rights, quietly
and calmly ready to matntain them.
Tha*. is the peace of a gentleman."
"Our opponcnts do not sem ta like
the idea of criticism with respect to ,
international policy; but I beg to re
mind them that an Amencan Presi-;
dent is elected for a term of four years
and that under our institution?, at the
conclusion of that ten.i, the Ameriean
people express their minds. \*?h?n a
matter is as important as the mainte?
nance of Ameriean righta, it ia highly
necessary that Amencan opinion shojuld
be expressed."
Hughea Sure of Suceeas
There is not a doubt in the Republi?
can candidate's mind about what the
expression of that opinion will be next
Tuesiay. Keturning to-day from Ohio i
and Indiana to a whirlwind three-day
Balflfl in New York, Mr. Hughes ex?
pressed "a profound sense of gratifica
tion and entire confidence with respect
to the result in both of these states."
And when somebody in Troy this even- ,
ing shouted out: "Charlie, glad to see
you home again," Mr. Hughes replied:
"I am very glad to be home again. 1 |
come. to you very happy ln being the
aaahasaaaa of the reunited Republican
8 *
party."
Batavia, Oneida, Schenectady, Troy,
Amsterdam and Albany continued the
remarkable ovations that Mr. Hughea
received through the Middle West All
through the upper part of the state he
was halled enthusiastlcally as "the next ,
Praeident of the United States." Not !
only were the erowds that greetad him
greater than when he rampaigned here
a few days ago, but they reeponded
more flf BtflBflflBfllj. it seemed.
Rouilng Reception Given
Albany hnd been preparing for days
for hia coming. William Barnei, who
dirccted things personally, did him?
self proud. The I'nronditional Re?
publican Club, which was formed in
th days of Grant, led the parade of
2,500 rnarchers and bands up State
Lnd Washington streets. Mr Barnes
prrsided over the meeting in Harma
nus Bleecker Hall. where 4,000 men
ond women cheered Mr. Hughes seven .
minutes. When the crowd let up
ahouting " 'Rah for Hughes" and
"Who's all right?" Mr. Barnes said:
"There ifl one quality which is es
bential to a man in high offlee. re
?pri.sible to a great people. *o whom
h?* asaumes obligations. That is that
his deeds should eonrorm to his words.
That the Amencan ptop'.e has not
row, that it will have in Mr. Hughes.
Hughea'fl View of KaerutUe
"We are now looking forward to the
responsihilities of Administration, and
I deaire to speak to you v.:th respect
to what I regard the essential eondi?
tions of nationai leadership to be. The

General I.uis Herrera, arith a garri?

and a fe? loyal troops fled to the

joined Villa.
Whether the nine Americans known
to have been in I'arral escaped with
Herrera, could not be lei.rned to-night.
Grave fear* are folt for their safetj.
One report says Villa. upon entermg

The Mexican. are declared to have

AMERICAN FLIERS
TO CHANGE TITLE
Washington Objects to
Corps's Name as
Unneutral
Wa.-hington. Nov. 2. The famous
Amencan Aviation Corps of the French
army probably soon will lose its dis
tinetive title as a result of protests to
the State Department *hat use of the
name is not compatible with Ameriean
neutrality. There will be no formal
exchanges on the subject, but the State
Department will suggest informally to
the French Foreign Office that mention
of the "Am*rican" corps in official corn
muniques places this country in an
embariassing position. There is no
doubt here that this point of view will
be appreeiatfld in Paris.
The' corps. made up of a large num?
ber of young Amencan aviators, wai
rflcruited and organized as a separat"
ur.it BJ special jiermission of the
Krench "military authonties. Its mem
B4 r- have distinguished themselves
time and again, particu'.arly at Verdun.
When KirTen Rockwell was killed
recentlv German newspapers printed
violent attacks upon the l.'nited
States, declaring that the presence of
Americans in the French army was
proof that this country's neutrality
was vanishing. Later, however. the
semi-offlcial Overseas News Agency
onnounced that the Impenal goyern
ment did not consider the volunteer
mg of Americans as a breach of neu?
tral it>.
The complaints to the State Depart?
ment fallawfld a recent reference to
thf Anifrmans in an official French
communiqu''-.
I'rtcedent for action was set early

quest of the Washington government,
(,r. at Britain had the namo "Ameri?
ean I.egion" withdrawn from a Cana

The President rendere.i an ac
cnunt of his atcwardflhip to the 13,
000 men ar.d women packed into Mad*
ison Square Garden. Hfl told them
what his Administration had done,
what he, if re'iectcd, intenied to do.
He was cheered fur almost half an
hour bflrforfl hia address began, but hfl
spoke throughout. to the accompani
ment of the drunrming of feet on
both the gallery and main floor,
caused by thousands leaving tha
building.
Apparently N>w York had come

Those who had waited sim-e early
afternoon to fight their way into the
Garden, those who had dared the
turmoil which boili'd so wickedl*/
about the entranoes, that one man
was knifed, and many were bruised
and battered, spent their enthusiasru
for Wilson in ono tremendnus iurst
of cheering. Then many of them
rerrrained to listen, with only occa
sonal bursts of applau.se in responas
to what he had to say, but many
more turned their baxks upon tha
Chief Kxecutive and went home.
Gallery Empties r **t
Before Mr. Wilson was half
through his address, one of the
briefest ever made by a candidate
in Madison Square Garden. the gal?
lery seats opposite the stand were
almost empty.
The meeting started alowly, but
had worked itself up into a state of
enthusiasm by the tiT.<* the Presi?
dent arrived. Kor nearly a half
hour the Garden was filled with the
roar of cheering. That was the
climax.
For some reason, the tension and
the interest grew suddenly slaek aa
the President began hi? address. Ha
said:
