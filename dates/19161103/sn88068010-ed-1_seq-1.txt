Reactionary Candidate of Inter
ests, Saws wood, Says Nothing
Roosevelts' Dupe
Ten Questions
1. Why is Wall Street for
Hughes?
2. Why is the disloyal vote
for Hughes?
3. Why are the great financial
inteseststhat are still plotting to
substitute a central bank for the
Federal Reserve System for
Hughes?
4. Why are the tariff mono-
op -lists who dictate the sched
ule? of the repudiated Payne
AMrich tariff for Hughes?

nents of American neutrality for
Hughes?
6. Why are the advocates of
aimed intervention and war with
Mexico for Hughes?
7. Why are the trusts for
Hughes?
8. Why are the champions of
military conscription for Hughei.?
9. Why are all the elements
of political reaction and political
BourbonUm for Hughes?
10. Why is tvery enemy of
industrial, financial and corpora
tion reform fur Hughes?
Mr. Hughes denounces method
by which strike was settled. But
admits he would not repeal the
Adam son Law.
Mr. Hughes is supported by
Wail Street, the aUloyal press
and organizations, by financiers
having selfish interests in Mexico
and by outright supporters ot the
Allies, such as Theodore Roose
velt'" Invites' thsloyai support
bv using vague generalities when
speaking of his "Americanism."
Admics he has no program.
Reiusestosay what he would
have done, or will do if he were
President. Promises nothiug
except "personal support" of the
federal amendment for woman
suffrage. Offets nothing to the
people but destructive criticism
of actions already written into
history by President Wilson.
No man was ever put in office
who did not dissapoint his chief
and all other supporters, no one
knowing what he proposed to do
before his installation. Judge
Taftwasan inglorious failure.
Roosevelt named and elected
him. Roosevelt permits d Judge
' Huyhes nomination and is sup
porting him. Why?

will be in Keytesville
want you and your Committee to thoroughly ad
vertise this meeting and see to it that all
our friends are out to hear him.

one of the most eloquent men that has ever
taken the stump in support of Democracy.

any unnecessary time elapse in getting notice
of this meeting out over the county and sur
rounding territory. I am sure you will do all
that is right, so leave it in your hands.

curing Col. Atwood to close the campaign the committee has af
forded them an opportunity to hear cne of the foremost orators of
the Nation. j
The State Committee has called upon me to make this a memor
able meeting. I can do nothing without the co-operation of the

do so, will be present next Monday night and give to Col.

Walter Dempsey, son of Mr.
and Mrs J. R. Dempsey and sis
ter of Miss Emma Hill Dempsey
j of Carthage and well known here
and Miss Helen Fox of that city,
eloped and were marriod at Col
umbus Kans. Oct 20.
The bridegroom is 15 vears of
age and the bride is 14, both
high school pupils.
They made their getaway to
Columbus Kas. and had the cer
emony over with. On their re
turn home they learned that
their mothers had gone to Joplin
in search of them to prevent the
combine. The young couple then
eloped to Kansas City from which
Mrs Dempsey telephoned her
parents 'that they would return
if they would not undertake to
separate them. Mr. Fox went
to Kansas City in his car and
brot the newly weds to his home
where they now reside along
with all parental blessings.
Against Prohibition
; A number of dry County Edi
tors have accepted for their pap
era pay articles against . the
amendment to be voted on next
week. . At least two formerly
very dry papers in this district
have openly declared against the
amendment-
All such had a perfect right to
do so. yet a few hypocritical
mud slingers are boosting their
sychophai t c Pharisaism by criti
cism and abuse.
The American Issue, as rotten
journal as is printed in the coun
try with one exception, says such
editors have sold themselves to
the liquor interests. The fortu
nate features in this case is that
Shupp and Clark, the editors of
American Issue are held in
greater contempt by decent peo
ple than the worst dive-keeper
or bootlegger doing time at the
pen, -
Fcvember 6th, and I
Col. Atwood is on all
Chairman.
