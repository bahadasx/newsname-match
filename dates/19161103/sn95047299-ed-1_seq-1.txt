A telegram from Gainesville on
Wednesday morning stated that E. C.
Smart of Palatka was shot and killed
and that J. L. McDonald is apparent
ly in a dying condition as the result
of a pistol duel which occurred on
the streets of Trenton Tuesday after
noon about 2:30 o'clock. The tragedy
occurred in front of Lancaster's drug
store on the main street of the little
town. It is alleged that McDonald's
17-year-old daughter had some disa
greement with her mother on Thurs
day of last week and went first to
Newberry and thence to Valdosta. It
is said that Smart left on Saturday
and joined the young lady. Miss Mc
Donald returned to Trenton Monday
afternoon. Smart was walking up the
main street of the town when Mc
Donald approached and commenced fi.
ring, the first shot taking effect in
Smart's back. It is alleged that
Smart wheeled around, drew his gun
and shot. About this time the two
men clinched. McDonald received two
wounds, one inthe stomach and the
other between the eyes, and at a late
hour tonight is said to be in a dying
condition. Smart was shot in the
back, in the stomach, in the chest and
in the head and lived only about hf
teen minutes. The tragedy is a sad
one and has cast a gloom over the
little town. Mr. McDonald is a trav
eling man and has a wife and three
daughters. Smart is said to have left
a wife and two children in his home
town of Palatka. Smart has been
working in Trenton for about five
weeks.
Chief Livingston arrested Mr,
Smart in this city last Monday soon
after his arrival here from Jackson'
ville. He was wanted at Trenton
and under arrangements with the of
ficer at that place Mr. Smart was al
lowed to co to Trenton unattended
That he arrived there all right can
not be doubted.
Up to some few weeks ago Smart
worked for the Weaver furniture store
in this city. Then he resigned to go
to work in a hardware store at Tren
ton. His family is still living here,
but had expected to move to Iren
ton in a short time.
Col. Robert W. Davis, without
doubt Florida's most gifted, cultured
and popular political orator, has been
secured todeliver an address in be
half of the Democratic nominees at
the Court House tomorrow (Satur
day) night.
For ten years (Jol. Davis represent
ed the old Second Congressional dis
trict of Florida in Congress. He is
now the Registrar of the U. S. Land
Office at Gainesville.
He is the "Grand Old Man of Flor
ida," and as a platform speaker he is
in a class by himself. Wo man in
Florida ever stood as close to the peo
ple. He is a "Gentleman of the Old
School," a patriot.
Owing to the fact that the work of
his office requires his presence there
during certain hours of each day, Loi.
Davis has not been able to make any
extended trips for speaking in the
present campaign, but has conhned
his work solely to Alachua county,
which allows him to spend a portion
of each day in his office. But he
has consented to deliver one address
in Palatka his old home town and
the committee arranged that this ad
dress shall be delivered at the Court
House Saturday evening.
Indications are that the buidling
will be crowded to its capacity and
all who desire seats should be on
hand promptly at 7:45.
Another speaker of the evening
will be Mr. Frank Wideman of Jack
sonville, a young attorney.
Mr. Wideman is one of Florida's
most brilliant young orators and for
several weeks his services have been
in constant demand throughout the
State in the interests of the Demo
cratic nominees. Mr. .Wideman is
a graduate of Stetson University, De
Land, and several years ago, his grad
uation year, he won the oratorical
prize contest in this State. Later he
won the Inter-Collegiate Oratorical
prize at St. Louis, Mo., over competi
tors representing all the leading uni
versities of the country. His sub
ject on that occasion was "Prohibi
tion." During the past year he was
sent by the National Anti-Saloon
League ' to Western States to assist
in statewide proniuiuun i-aiujiaigua.
Editor Palatka News:
Suffering Palatka is still speculat
ing on her water problem. The News
-McNally controversy of a week or
so ago had the virtue of prompting
some independent cogitation and from
the mental achives of otherwise busy
minds comes the solution. Palatka
is squatting on the resevoir that is
the source of the present soft water
supply that is now controlled by the
Boston company, and for the meas-
ley sum of $2,000 can tap it and
secure her share of the millions of
gallons stored there. Three S-in. wells
with pump attachment, will produce
approximately 12,000 gallons per hour,

to take its place among the success

will be several hundred exhibits inclu

of all kinds, woman's work, preserves,

That Bostwick Meeting.
Judge Julian C. Calhoun addressed
a meeting of citizens of Bostwick
precnict at the Bostwick station last
Wednesday noon in the interests of
the Democratic nominees. The morn
ing paper thought it was slurring this
meeting when it remarked that "71
were present." As there are but 84
qualified voters at this precinct, all
tokl, white and negroes, and as the
meeting was not generally advertised,
it is the opinion that Judge Calhoun
had a very good audience. Anyway,
ho made a hit with those present, 'tis
said, and certainly spread some truths
which are expected to bear fruit on
election day.

To Organize Maccabees
The deputy state commanders are
in Palatka for the purpose of organi
zing a tent of the Maccabees. This
organization is one of the oldest in
America, the first tent having been
formed in 1878. Today the member
ship is over 350,000. The organiza
tion has paid out in claims over $88,
000,000. The securities comprise the
very best, consisting of U. S State
and municipal bonds. , The order has
over $750,000 invested in Florida
alone, with $50,000 invested in Palat
ka. The accumulated funds of the
Maccabees is now over $20,000,000.
The rates are adequate and it is ex
pected that a large tent will be form
ed here.

Catts and Republicans.
That there is a coalition between
the republican party and the Catts
forces grows daily more apparent.
First, Billy Parker, the chief prima
ry, transfers his activities to the re
publican channels, and is organizing
the cohorts of the Before Day clubs
for the support of the entire republi
can ticket. Now comes George W.
Allen, the republican candidate for
governor, and declares that the race
is between himself and Catts, his evi
dent object being to encourage the
election of Catts. As a matter of
fact, George Allen has no more idea
of being elected governor of Florida
than he has of becoming doorkeeper
of the Kingdom of Heaven, but he
thinks if he can bring about the elec
tion of Catts, thereby completing the
disruption of the democratic party in
Florida, the republicans will have a
walk-over four years hence. This is
in line with the plan of the republican
bosses Nelson A. Miles et al and
part of the program which was begun

tools, Sidney J. Catts and Billy Par

Heights. Certain federal geological
surveys were studied in pursuit of
that work, which indicated two phos
phate beds, in some places, lying
above a porous rock formation that
connnes tne nrst water table at a
depth of GO ft to 220 ft. The res
ervoir there formed is the source of
White Water Branch; the Etonian
stream, of which Mr. Bailey is most
justly proud; many of our nearby
fresh water lakes and a generous con
tributor to the St. Johns River. The
wrter has a trace of mineral matter
in its natural resevoir but nature
eliminates that feature by sundry fil
trations before she delivers it to the
surface, the phosphate deposits
through which it is forced neutraliz
ing the mineral matter and the clay
and sand deposits above further com
pleting the operation of purification.
Where the last strata of earth hap
pens to be contaminated with decay
ed vegetable matter the water be
comes undesirable.
When Palatka sank the first well
for her present plant, she struck that
water table, discarded it owing to lack
of flow and continued down to the
second water table which produces an
artesian flow and the water of which
is heavily impregnated with mineral
matter, that is what she is trvine
to digest to-day. However! before
that was done Mr. G. Loper Bailey
conceived the idea of conserving the
water from the first table by install
ing acep set reservoirs. After gener
ously spending about $2000.00 person
ally on tne project, he discarded it as
inadequate. The belief has been ex
pressed that had Mr. Bailey's engin
eer or tne city s engineer installed an
adequate deep-well pump, Palatka
need never have been annoyed with
her present quality of water. As ev
idence of that fact, the MacGregor
Estate and S. L. Lyon of Palatka
Mights each have a four inch well tap.
ping the first water table. The first
has a depth of 221 feet in which the
water rises within 40 feet of the sur
face; the second a depth of 100 feet
in which the water rises to within
32 feet of the surface. With proper
deep well cylinder and 2 horse eras
engine those wells have each produc
ed 1000 per hour over 10 to 12 hour
periods without the least disturbance
of the supply volume. The city's fire re
servoir stands in an angle with these
two wells, and at the same altitude.
Three 8-in wells on that property will
oe a bonanza. The trace of min
eral is promptly eliminated up n aer
ation, leaving a perfectly soft water.
as the water tables drift east, locn
tion of the wells is suggested on the
h:ll to eliminate any possibility of
contamination from the present ones.
Sevcrr.l of Palatka qffieials arc aware
of these facts, so I can but join the
wondering multitude in speculating
on their procrastination in putting Pa
latka back on the map of the soft
water world.

A dispatch from Minneapolis th.

being hot on the trail of certain pro
moters who have been promoting an
endless chain swindle. The dispatch
said that thousands of letters are
flooding the local postoffice daily from
women throughout the county who
joned an "endless chain" scheme, pro
moted by "national fwokerage ex
change." Every woman who sent ten cents
and wrote five friends ursine thpm
to join the "chain exchange," was
promised a new 1917 model silk petti

cers of the "exchange" for using the
mails to defraud.
compare favorably with that of the
various county fairs. The National
convention of the Farmers Union of
America will meet in Palatka the
same week as the fair and as there
will be about two thousand or more
visitors from all over the United
States at that time President Mur
phy is arranging with Supt. S. P. Hol
lenrake of the Oclawaha Valley Rail
road for low rates and special trans
portation facilities from Palatka and
Ocala during the two days of the
Fair.
Putnam and Marion counties are
bound together by common interests
and close personal relationships. It
is to their interest to work together
for the development of this section of
Florida which is already leading the
state in several lines of agriculture
and live stock raising. The Orange
Springs Fair can be made a great
get-together meeting for the people
of the two counties and it can be
made of particular benefit to Marion
county as it is gathering up exhib
its and stimulating interest in fairs
which will be of direct benefit to the
Marion county fair in Ocala the fol
lowing week. It will greatly incret.se
the number of the Marion County
Fair's exhibits as many will be taken
from the Orange Springs Fair there.
It will also stimulate attendance on
the fair as it will give a splendid op
portunity for Marion county to bring
its fair directly to the attention of
thousands of people who otherwise
might feel no special interest in it.
CLAUDE S. TMEY
IS DEAOJN DELAND.
DeLand, Nov. 2 (Special) Claude
Steele Tingley, professor of chemis
try of Stetson university, died at his
DeLand home early Wednesday morn
ing. Mr. Tingley had been in poor
health for several months. He was
very popular with students and fac
ulty and will be mourned by the citi
zens of DeLand as one of the best
of their number.
Deceased was a member and one of
the trustees of the Baptist church
here, and took a prominent part in all
church work. He leaves a wife and
mother to mourn his loss.
Funeral services will be held Thurs
day afternoon, interment in Oakdale
cemetery.
Prof. Tingley was graduated from
the Palatka high school, Class of
1902, his classmates being H. E. Mer
ryday, William L. Calhoun, Miss Min
nie Buky and Mrs. D. W. Ramsaur.
Prof. Tingley even in that day was
looked upon as a young man who was
sure to make his mark in the world
of letters. He was perhaps the
brightest young man ever to graduate
from the Palatka High School. On
leaving here he entered Stetson Uni
versity, and after his graduation
from that institution he accepted pro
fessorships in western colleges, final
ly returning to De.Land to accept the
chair of chemistry in Stetson. His
home while here was at San Mateo.
Prof. Tingley was 32 years of age.
A "Spook" Party.
A line of white hooded and cloaked
figures silently filed down Lemon
street Tuesday evening and invaded
the Grand theater where they enjoyed
the pictures and after the entertain
ment, left for James' Cafe where they
enjoyed a bountiful supper. A num
ber of Palatka s younger society set
were in the party.
