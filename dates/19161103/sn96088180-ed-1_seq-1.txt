Average of HO HilesHcur
New York. Nov. J. Victor Carl
strom swooped down from the sky
today, landed at Governor's island
and closed his lightning-like journey
from Chicago. He had bung up a
new American non-stop record ye-
terday and made his journey at an
average speed ot more than 110 miles
an hour.
Little mora than a speck, he soared
near the Island just before 4 a. nu.
after quitting Hammondsport, N. T.,
315 miles away, at 6:35 a. m. He
circled beyond the island, while New
Yorkera from their skyscraper gal
leries watched. Then he swept down
from the air, glided gracefully across
the parade ground and came to an,
easy atop. t , - -
Hla actual flying time for the Jour
ney of about 975 miles was eight
hours and 37 minutes. He left Chi
cago at (:0I yesterday morning. Tea-
terday he made Erie, Pa., 425 mile
from Chicago, and then had to come
down because just one little loose nut
made further journeying imprac
ticable. This shattered hla hope ot
a Ohlcago-to-New York non-etop trip.
But h.e swept on to Hammondsport,
put up his monstrous 200-horsepower
biplane for the night, and then aris
ing early did his 315 miles here la
two hours and twenty minutes.
In breaking his own American
non-stop record he was about 350
miles behind the European record,
approximately 800 miles, a journey
from the French lines to Chelm, Aus
trian Poland, by a French military
aviator.
The chill ot a stiff November breeze
had struck into Carlstrom'a bones, so
he hastened away soon to get hea
vier clothing.
General Wood, commander of the
eastern department of the army, was
one of the first to greet and congratu
late the aviator and then officials ot
the Aero Club ot America swarmed
about him.
A courier from Long Branch hur
ried away with a letter Carlstrom
carried from Mayor Thompson of
Chicago for President Wilson, while
a postal clerk took a bag of mall from
the aeroplane.
