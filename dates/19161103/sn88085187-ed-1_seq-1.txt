Girls, Never Visit a Barber Shop If
You Would Retain Your Faith In Men
By a Woman Reporter
May I go without manicure and
face massage to the end of my
days If EVER again I knock the
members of my own fair sex!
You see, It'a like this:
I happened to be In a barber
■hop yesterday—our work takes
us into all aorta of Interesting
places—and there I found out this
about men:
THAT they're twice as vain as
women.
THAT, although they try to tell
us a barber shop IS only a barber
■hop, it's really a beauty parlor.
THAT niue men out of ten want
to look like Mr. Adonis.
A • igin-.-i-11. tnrer.
The first man who came
through the swinging doors waa
one of these clgaret-bearers, with
at raw-colored balr. and mustach.
He sat In one of the big white
chairs and took off his collar and
tie.
Oh dear, Marie! What a dis
illusionment it la to see a man
take off hia collar and tie.
Let me tell you what he had
the barber do to him.
"A Hank of Hair."
And tbe worat of It waa that
the barber knew by heart what
that chap wanted.
Firat of all, the barber cut tho
chap's hair end •hayed him.

A MAN WHO
IS WORTH
THE $4,000
John D. Fletcher is a high-grade attorney.
He is progressive-minded, too. He be
lieves our present court procedure is anti
quated.
And he is not;—distinctly not—a politic
ian.
He is just the type of lawyer that usually
cannot be induced to seek a judgeship.
He is the sort who can easily earn a
judge's salary in private practice and who
shrinks from the campaigning and the lime -
light that go with office holding.
All of which are very good reasons why
Pierce county next Tuesday ought to give
John D. Fletcher a record vote for superior
court judge.

Two of the most enormous
crowds that ever fought their way
into Madison Square Garden and

LAST CHANCE TO GUESS
ON STADIUM'S CAPACITY
'i'lii 4 Is the last call for guesses
In The Times Stadium contest.
The contest closes at noon Sat
urday.
No absolutely correct riicss has
yet been received, so there Is still
a chance to win the prize by
guessing a little nearer than those
who have already guessed.
The first correct guess, or If no
correct guess Is received, then the
nearest one, will receive $1 In
cash.
The figures In The Times' pos

"No, I'll have an egg," said the

"Ah, this will be Interesting,"
I thought. They feed you, too,
evidently. Wonderful way for
the utisy business man to take hia
lunch."

But It was only an egg sham

on the man's head, then rubbed
them into n sort of raw omelet.
Really I couldn't bear to look
I felt aa though I were peeking
through a keyhole.

Five thousand police were in

while another 12,000 waited for

The thousands packed in the

To reach the Garden the presi

a lave of humanity and with Mrs.

Mrs. Wilson had shopped dur

a yellow chiffon gown, embroid

narrow bands of moleskin, to

While she selected these, tho
president waited patiently outsiJo

1X)8 ANGEI.KB, Nov. 3. —
With the mysterious llcnton L..
liarrett double murder ruse no
nearer solution than the day the
aged farmer confessed to killing
his wife and stepson on their
ranch near Santa Monica, both
prosecution and defense agreed
upon a plan today which may
either set Barrett free or place
him on trial for murder.
Barrett 1r to he given the "drug
test," If physicians agree he is
phyHlcally able to stand It.
He will be plarod under the In
fluence of chloroform or ether
for a period of 24 hours. As he
comes out of the anaesthetic,
medical men declare, he will un
consciously recite facts exactly as
they happened.
District Attorney Wool wine ad
mitted today that he (b far lrom
satisfied with the evidence at
hand. He referred to Barrett aa
a "most lovable old man," declar
ing it was almost impossible to
listen to his quaint theories on
the hereafter and not doubt his
story of the killing.
Both defense attorneys and
deputies prosecuting the case
agree that a brush fire only of
a few hours duration seen blazing
on the Barret farm on the night
of the murder could not possibly
have consumed the bodies of Mrs.
Barrett and her son, Raymond.
A possible parallel to the Bar
rett case was cited as having oc
curred near Walla Walla, Wash.,
some 'years ago. A cabin was
burned and inside were found
charred bones. An unfortunate
"fiddler," who had been the last
person at the supposed dead man's
cabin, was found guilty of mur
der and served seven years in
prison before the dead man waa
discovered alive.

Only 66 deaths were recorded
last month, as against 77 In

"That very one," answered the
caahier. "Well, he buya that
kaiser-look here, too."
After shaving him, the barber
curled and waxed that Iron-gray
mustach until it stood up like a
stag's antlers. And he waxed the
"kaiser's" pompadour until it
shone like steel.
While this was being done the
