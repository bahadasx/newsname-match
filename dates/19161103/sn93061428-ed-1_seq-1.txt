And may the good I-ord bluss you

will bring Cole Bros' World-Toured
Shows and trained wild animal exhi
bition to Carlsbad on Saturday Nov
11 for two performances, afternoon
and night, rain or shine. This is the
show that you have been waiting for,
tho Cole Bros.' famous show that
stands without a rival. Everybody
knows them, for they never advertise
what ttiey do not give, hence the
big top is always jammed with a
happy eager crowd. Originality and
progressiveness have been the watch
words of tftiese kings of the arena.
They have invested hundreds of
thousands of dollars, have given
years of careful aysematic prepara
tion to perfect their wonderful or
ganisation, and a glorious reward Is
the culmination of their efforts.
In order to obtain the latest and
best in the amusement world, to sat
isfy the ever changing public, to re
tain the patronage and popularly so
n?essary for the continuance of a
traveling institution of such magni
tude to accomplish which the Cole
Bros, have balked at no effort no
matter how herculean, or at any pe
cuniary outlay no matter how extra
vngant. e .
Truly are these popular showmen
called "The Uve Wires of the White
Tops." This season they have hit
upon a decided novelty in the im
provement of the arena acts, those
artists who have reached the highest
pinnacle of fume have been secured,
and their hairbreadth escape from
inrtant death, keep the audience on
the tiptoe of excitement.
Among the features are the Berne
Bros., the Htrongest men on earth,
direct from Europe, first time seen
marvelous strength and wrestling
nmti-hes; "Cheerful" Gardner and his
herd of performing elephants, these
wonderfully trained animal actors dn
everything but talk, adding lota of
comedy to their act.
