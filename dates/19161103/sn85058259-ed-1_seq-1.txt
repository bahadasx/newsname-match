Political Warnings.
These are wild ani. unsettled times
on the eve of a great election, and
fanatical politicians on both sides ure
on the lookout for any kind of a scare
story that they can sprinp- at the last
minute when it is too late for it to
be effectually contradicted which will
have the effect of (stampeding the vot
ers to their side of the "fence." Thli
year it is most likely to have n ferenc M
to the prohibition question, as that la
recognized as the parimount issue in
this state, and is more likely than
anything else to carry the hysterical
and emotional voter off his or her feet
than anything else. There has been
ample time since the campaign opened
to ascertain the stand of each candi
date on this question and any thi is
of importance, and they are not like
ly to reverse a life-long policy at the
eleventh hour in order to gain an im
aginary advantage. The liquor inter
ests include a crafty and unscrupulous
lot of politicians, and they may give
out the information that they are be
hind the candidacy of a man whom
they fear and wish to defeat, for the
express purpose of turning the sup
porters of prohibition away from such
candidate. Another possibility is that
seeing no chance for the election of
the candidate of their choice, this ele
ment may themselves stampede to
the opposite candidate, realizing full
well that a defeated candidate can
not be of any use to them, and hone
ing to currey some little favor by th"
support at the 11th hour of the can
didate they see is bound to win any
how. These are al. possibilities the.
may account for suspicious conduct on
the part of that element. And if vou
have formed your opinions as to cun
didates and policies in your calmer
momenta it would be well to remain
steadfast and not permit yourself to
be carried away by any sensational
Eleventh hour disclosures, which may
i or may not have the slightest founda-
,r tion in fact.
OUR POLITICAL PAGES.
As forecasted last issue we are pre
senting our readers in this number a
rather novel and decidedly interesting
, feature in the form of a page each,
written, edited and directed by the
Republican and Democratic ladies of
Cedar City. And while the innovation
has been a severe tax upon the me
chanical department, due to the fact
that help is absolutely unobtainable
and it is such an exceedingly busy
time just before election, still the re
sults fully repay for all the trouble
and extra time we have had to devote.
The ladies have acquitted them
selves splendidly on both sides, and
have put out pages that are a great
credit to thein. Any "Doubting
Thomases" who set up the claim that
the women cannot grasp political
issues and problems as well as men,
would do well to set themselves about
the task of preparing belter material
for a political page than the ladies
have done on this occasion.
Being a little out of their line, the
results shown were not accomplished
without considerable effort on their
part, but it has been excellent prac
tice for them, and has been the means
of causing them to refresh themselves
to some extent upon the political is
sues of the day and enables them to
give a more plausible and intelligent
"reason for the hope within them."
The ladies have our thanks for their
willing and enthusiastic response to
our invitation to trv the experiment,
which we believe wil be attended with
only the best of feelings on both sides.
We have tried to treat both sides
with absolute fairness and impartial
ity. Read the pages carefully and see
what the ladies are capable of.

L
SOME IMPORTANT
BUSINESS CHANGES
Wm. Palmer Resigns from Mercantile
Store to Become Cashier of
Projected New Bank.
Some important business changes
have been taking place in Cedar City
during the past few dayr.
The new bank, which has been un
der consideration by its promoters for
some months post, has now bejCOBH
enough of a certainty that W. R. Pal
mer has resigned his position as man
ager of the Cedar Mercantile & Live
stock company to become its cashier.
The position of manager relit:
quished by Mr. Palmer has been tend
ered to Mr. II. II. Lunt, who has long
been a faithful and trusted employee
of the store, a position there is no rea
son to believe he will decline, although
with his duites of bishop of the Cedar
East ward, city councilman and other
affairs, he will be pretty heavily load
ed down.
Nothing defiinite is yet given out as
to how soon the new bank will open
its doors, as there are still a lot of
details to be worked out, but the char
ter has been assured, the stock is al
most entirely subscribed, and it will be
only a short time until Cedar City
will have two banks in operation. In
the mean time Mr. Palmer will retain
his connection with the store.
With the rapid development that is
under way here, we dare say that
not only will there be a field here for
another bank, but that the Bank of
Southern Utah, the strongest bank
south of Provo, will continue to in
crease its present business from year
to year, despite the organization of a
competative bank. One thing is cer
tain there is no danger of us getting
too much money to take care of the
developments needed here, and if an
other bank will bring more money, it
will doubtless receive a welcome.
HOME ECONOMICS MEETING.

Cedar City met in the Domestic Art

were few of our people able to attend;
but those present had an interesting
time.
The Democratic Committee called a

"Prohibition in Danger," placed there
by the State Democratic committee

This was not the intention, and ap
pears so, due to the failure to nut the
itaual rule and space between the tw
articles and show thus that there were
two articles, one signed by Mathoniah
Thomas, the other by Heber J. Grant.
This article was given Mi'. Rollo of

and that he would explain it as such.
Let us hope that we will continue to
keep out of our county campaign the
bitterness and scandals characterizing
the campaign in the north. Both
county tickets are unusually strong,
and every man on them is clean and

The campaign is nearly over; let it
not now be turned into one of personal
