FACTS OF SINKING OF
MARINA NOT AT HAND
Not Expected by State Department

Washington, Nov. 2. Conclusive ev
idence as to whether Germany violated
her pledges to the United States in
the sinking apparently without warn
ing of the British freighter' Marina
with the loss of six American lives is
not expected by the state department
before the latter part of next veek. "
Secretary Lansing before leaving to
night for his home at Watertown, N.
Y., to stay until after the election, said
Information was coming in slowly to
the department, that he would not be
leaving Washington if anything final
were expected immediately .and--, at -
least a": week 'was expected to elapse
before full evidence -woud be at hand.
Even though all Information desired
from British sources and American
survivors of the Marina were at band,
any action by the nited States would
the informal-request for her version or
be delayed pending Germany's reply to
the Incident. In previous instances
where such a request has been made, a
week or more has elapsed before the
attacking submarine has come in and
several days further have been need
ed to collect and transmit the inform
ation. . American officials in England
have sent on only a few despatches In

City Today. '
Batavia, N. Y.. Nov, 2. Charles E.
Hughes declared today, before an au
dience here, that he is entirely confi
dent of the result in both Ohio and
Indiana.
"I have returned from a trip through
Ohio and Indiana." he said, "with a
profound sense of gratification and
entire confidence with respect to the
result in both states. In both Ohio
and Indiana.it is not exaggerating to
say that I had receptions which per
haps exceeded those accorded to any
other presidential candidate.
Reunited Republican Party.
"That was, of course, as I said last
night, not a tribute to me persopally,
but it was an indication of the deep
interest the people are taking in the
essential conditions of their prosper
ity and their satisfaction that there is
a great reunited republican party
ready for service a this critical time.
"So far as promises go, no one can
exceed the promises of our opponents,

this time, in a satisfactory manner,
but if we - endeavor to ascertain by
what principle they are to be guided,
we look in vain. I propose to tell you
by what principles we shall be guid
ed." Mr. Hughes then reiterated the poli
cies which he intends . to follow if
elected. Flirt- in -was -three-quarters

ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS OF

WHY GERMANS EVACUATED
FOT VAUX AT VERDUN
Sacrifices for Its Retention Out
of
Proportion to Its Value.
Berlin, Nov. 2. . (By Wireless to The
Associated Press via Sayville). Fort
Vaux at Verdun was evacuated on the
night of November 1-2 in accordance
with pre-arranged plans, according to
the German military leaders who in
dicated that they considered the sac
rifices involved in its retention out of
proportion to Its value in the present
German strategic scheme. .
The Associated Press representative
was informed on the evening of Nov.
1 from German headquarters of the
impending evacuation and the retire
ment of the German lines o positions
better adapted to defense and at the
same time was given an explanation
of the withdrawal.
Forts Douaumont and Vaux, It was
alleged, formed such a material ele
ment in the defense of Verdun as long
as they remained with unimpaired ar
mament in French hands that they
had to be put out of action in order
to cripple the fortress and once this
was accomplished the ruins of the
forts, with the . armaments removed,
possessed no such importance to the
Germans and served chiefly as tar
gets for the French artillery.
Now that Fort Douaumont "had
passed again into French possession,
Fort Vaux no longer, in the opinion
of the German leaders, justified the
heavy sacrifices necessary to retain
the ground about the fort, which is
ill-adapted to defense against attacks'
from the south and west. J-ort vaux
was therefore abandoned and the Ger
man lines retired to positions less ex
posed to the French artillery.
BEN HOGAN, HUMANITARIAN,

OHIO AND INDIANA
- . . ..
Nominee Gratified at the
That Trip to Middle West Has
Indiana and New York and, asserting
that he" was "looking forward to the
responsibilities of . administration,"
outlined what he regarded as "the es- ;
sential conditions of national leaders
ship." Mr. Hughes addressed an audience
that had waited nearly three hours to
hear him. He was introduced by
William Barnes, former republican
state chairman. The nominee, in pre
vious speeches today had declared that
he had no apologies to make for his
attacks on the administration for its
foreign policy, had characterized as
"very cruel and unwarrantable" the
suggestion that a vote for him meant
a vote for war, and had declared his
opposition to 'a muddle of meddle" in
America's foreign relations. .
Guardian of National Honor ' -'
"The executive is the guardian of
the national honor," Mr. Hughes de
clared. "He has a very wide discre- .
tion in the management of our foreign
relations. - He has his own judgment
almost exclusively as his guide and he
is not supposed to exercise that judg
ment except in conformity to the well
established principles of international
law. '
"It is not a whimsy he should con
sider it is not a loose generality, a
conceived service to humanity that
should engage bis attention. , It Is his
duty to nave nis country aoopt ana
follow correct principles of interna.-.
tional action recognized by the nations)
of the world and thus maintain the re
spect to which we are entitled and giv
ing us an opportunity to have a grow
ing interest through that esteem by
which indeed we can maintain , our
rights and in the end truly serve hu
manity." . - .....
The Peace of a Gentleman. -
Tt is not that we should be trucu
lent. It is not that we should go
about with any braggart assertion of
power. It is not that we should en-;
gage in bluster. I like the phrase
the peace of a gentlemen' but - the
peace of a gentleman Is unafraid, alert
in his self-respect and getting his
rights, quietly and calmly ready to
maintain them. That is the pence of
a gentleman." " s - :
In his speech here tonight a In
other speeches during the day, Mr.
Hughes declared that "there never has
been a time perhaps In our history
when It was easier to keep th nation
out of war than during the past few
years, when every nation engaged in
the great strife abroad desired 'Our
friendship and would not by reason of
any assertion of our just rights, for
feit that friendship."
The nominee was an hour late In
reaching Albany. His address here wa

many blocks long, which he headed
The station was packed with a crowd
awaiting his arrival and mny persons
