REPUBLICANS PUT OPPONENTS ON RUN

USED A.% 0 Ji BASKET
— v
Soldiers from Ft. Ha. ^ Intended
Showing; Resentment for -»nts.
Only the timely interference the
provost-guard from Fort Harrison
saved John Morgan Evans, Democrat
ic candidate for congress from being
rotten-egged at the Liberty Theatre
by indignant guardsmen of the Sec
ond Mont&na. When the tension was
at its height, the provost guord clear
ed the building of soldiers who at
tended the rally wit hthe express in
tention of forcibly showing their dis
like of the man who, at Miles City,
likened them to skurilts.
The seriousness of the demonstra
tion against John Morgan Evans was
shown by the offer of the provost
guard to detail 15 men to occompanyi
the speaker to The Placer. He de- !
clined the invitation. Later in the |
evening, at the Placer lobby, four or!
five soldiers came up to the man who I
had likened them to skunks and one!
started to argue with him. The pro- i
vost officer was keeping a weather!
eye on the congressman and inter-!
ferred, pushing the soldier one way;
anl Mr. Evans the other.
Mr. Evans, who followed Mr. Swin
dlehurst, had spoken a little while
when the 100 odd soldiers in the au
dience became restless. "Tell us;
about that Miles City speech," theyj
interrupted. Evans paid no atten
tion to them.
"Well why shouldn't we go into
Mexico?" chimed in a soldier, as the
speaker turned to the troubles of the
southern Republic. Evans retorted
he was not in the habit of debating
with intoxicated men. The soldier
boys laughed and made a noisy dem
onstration in approval of their com
rade's interruption.
Shortly Evans made the charge that
Wall street wanted the United States!
to intervene in Mexico.
"Well, let's send the soldiers down
to clean up Wall street, interpolated
a guardsman.
The house was thrown into an up
roar. Major Martin Maginnis, who
presided, rapped for order. When
a semblance of quiet was restored Mr.
Evans asked the soldier to wait and
he would explain how Wall street could
lie "cleaned up".
Major Maginnis protested against
the demonstration and the interrup
tions that became more frequent. He
said it was a political meeting, not a
debate, and that Mr. Evans was en
titled to the floor.
Louder and more insistent became
the refrain of the guardsmen "Let's
hear about that Miles City speech."
While only a few soldiers interrupted
their comrades encouraged them to
continue it. There was truculence in
every laugh, and masked by the noisy
gaiety was a feeling that boded ill
for the peace of the speaker.
Suddenly the provost officer ap
peared, and halting the proceedings,
ordered the soldiers to vacate the the
ater. A few disregarded the sum
mons, and then the officer detailed
other guardsmen forcibly to eject
them. This was not necessary, how
ever, and the soldiers filed out.
We had $5 worth of nice stale eggs
to change the color of the skunk
story," remarked a guardsman after
he left the hall, "and they would have
teen used if it had not been for the
appearance of the provost officer.
However, we are a busy little bunch
of penmen and are fairly deft at writ
ing letters to our friends. Just watch
get Mr. John Morgan Evans elec
tion day."
At the close of his talk Mr. Evans
tried to explain that Miles remark by
saying he xeferred to the gunmen
guardsmen of the Colorado labor trou
bles and not to the Montana boys.
"CIVILIZATION"
The people of Glasgow will have
an opportunity to see a decidedly un
ique innovation on the stage and a
genuine sensation when Thomas H.
Ince's $1,000,000.00 cinema spectacle
is presented at the Orpheum Theatre
here, Friday and Saturday, Novem
ber 3rd and 4th.
The remarkable moving picture, spec
tacle, which has been proclaimed by
critics of all cities where it has been
shown, the greatest ever produced, is
preceded by a prologue acted by a
large company of real players, with
massive scenic and startling electric
al effects. About 32 players are re
quired to present this acted drama.
It portrays a country at peace, with
harmony and love predominant. The
peasants are seen pursuing their daily
toil with cheer. The little girl in glee
pursues the singing birds. The fish
er boy starts for his favorite spot
as the first rays of the sun come over
the horizon. The gossips gather.
The lovers romp through the wood
lands. The cartiers are seen hauling
their produce to early market. All
is life, prosperity, and peace. The
angelus sounds and the heads of all
are bowed in thankful prayer for the
belessings that- God has showered up
on them.
On the ninth stroke there is a can
non's boom in the distance. This is
followed by a loud crash. Panic
reigns. A zeppelin is seen traveling
over the city in the distance, dropping
its death dealing bombs. Cannons
belch forth fire from the hillsides. A
monstarous bomb blows up the bridge
in the fore-grounds. There is dark
ness, and, in a mighty grotto in the
rear, amid flashes of lightning and
peals of thunder, the Goddess of Civ
ilization is seen humbling herself in
supplication on her knees before the
menacing God of War. As this vis
ion fades, the war comes closer. Sol
diers are seen retreatnig before the
awful fumes of gas bombs. They

are seen in their awful death, strug
gles against these deadly missies. The
darkness comes over it all, and the
great peace spectacle goes upon the
picture screen so magically that the
audience is left with the impression
that the people they see are as real
and as human as the actors who have
just been before their eyes.
This is the first time in the his
tory of the stage that the legitimate
drama and the moving picture have
been combined. Another remarkable
feature, in connection with the pre
setation of the Ince spectacle, is the
introduction of a soprano soloist, a
baritone soloist, and a large chorus
to sing incidental music at times
where such gives a convincing force
to the picture.
The orchestra which will play the
Victor L. Schertzinger music has won
the reputation of being the greatest
musical organization thät ever played
for any production in the Middle
West. The music for "Civilization"
is an entirely original selection, writ
ten to suit the pcture scene by scene.
The election of Republican Senate
and House is of vital importance to
every business man in the country.
Without a Republican Congress Mr.
Hughes as President would be unable
to carry out his policies.
Speech By S. C. Ford at Orpheum Saturday Night Dem
onstrates Democrats Will Be Badly Beaten.
HOT SHOTS BY G. W. FARR HIT MARK
Rounds of Applause Greets Mention of Charles Evans Hughes
As Next President of United States. Democrats Dis
satisfied With Their Own Party Work.
Saturday night at the Orpheum the -j
i atre, Geo. W. Farr, S. C. Ford and
Miss May Trumper spoke in the in-'
I terest of their candidacy to a most
enthusiastic audience. The meeting;
was the most successful of any held !
in the city during the campaign and
from the attention and the enthusi- ;
astic applause given when salient j
points were made, demonstrated the
audience was the speakers and strong
ly Republican.
I The first speaker was Miss May
Trumper, Republican candidate for
Superintendent of Public Instruction.!
j She made no attempt at a speech, but
in a quiet, forceful manner, outlined
1 her experience as an instrcctor andi
recited her qualifications tofulfill the
duties of the office to which she as
I pires. Her talk was short and void
of any vague promises as to what
she would do if elected, but its direct
ness and earnestness won her many
friends. All who heard her remarks
were convinced that she has the abil
ity and the proper education and ex
perience to fulfill the duties of Su
perintendent of Public Instruction.
S. C. Ford, Republican candidate for
Attorney General, then addressed the
people and in a most forceful man
ner called attention to the many in
efficiencies of the present Democratic
State officials and to their apparent
disregard of the taxpayers pocketbook.
He sighted many existing infringe
ments of the required duties of state
officials, and pointed out the great
waste of public funds in the various
departments. His recital of the use
of state patronage with which to keep
up the Democratic political machine
by which that party has maintained
control of public state offices for many
years was closely followed and the
argument presented to clean out the
State Capitol building was met with
continued applause.
Mr. Ford called attention to the
method employed by the Secretary of
State to sell automobile tags to own
ers of machines in the state at a pro
fit of 52 cents each whereby he was
able to reap a profit to himself of
approximately $12,000.00 a year. He
showed that for some unknown rea
I
son the Governor had held that the
Farm Loan Law was unconstitutional
and without securing any opinion from;
the supreme court of the state refus
ed to allow it to be put into opera
tion. By this one act of the Gov-!
ernor's, he stated, the farmers of the,
state were prevented from enjoying
the privilege of borrowing money for
the development of their property at 1
a rate of interest that would be rea
sonable. It also deprived the state
funds for school purposes from be
ing loaned out to Montana farmers,!
thus depriving the state of many
thousands of dollars which this mon
ey might earn for the state.
Mr. Ford promised that if the Re-i
publican party was successful at thej
polls in this state November seventh,
it would mean that the affairs of the
state would be .conducted upon a strict
business like principle and the people
would get the right kind of service
and the interest of the people would
at all times.be safeguarded.
The closing address of the evening
was made by Geo. W. Farr of Miles
City, Republican candidate for con
gressman. Mr. Farr is a most con-|
vincing and forceful speaker and from
the very moment he began to speak,
the sincerity and honesty of his ef
forts brought a responsiveness from
the audience which demonstrated that
they were with him. He opened by,
briefly stating that he did not intend,
to harangue and brow beat the oppo-|
sition political party. That it was
his purpose to show that the people!
of the United States as stock holders,
in this great corporation formed by '
the 48 states should have a business
like and proper handling of their af- j
fairs; that the man at the head ofi
the business of this institution should j
be a man of sterling worth, known
ability an dstrong, forceful purpose,
added to which should be the proper
discernment to judge and act for the
best interests of the entire people and
not for a few. He stated that such
a man had been selected to head the
Republican national ticket, a man who
had been tried and found true, not
only as Governor of a great state, but
as a Judge of the Supreme Court of
the United States. He the n named
Charles Evans Hughes, at the mention
of whose name there was an outburst
of applause that plainly indicated the
popularity of this great man.
"It is not necessary to go outside
of the Democratic party," Mr. Farr
stated, "to find condemnation of their
reckless and unreasonable handling of
public matters, nor is it necessary
that the Republicans should in any
way criticize the Democratic adminis
tration. All that is needed is to turn
to the Congressional records to find
that the greatest and most flagerent
waste of public funds, the most
responsible and vacilitating methods
of administering affairs of state have|
been most heartily condemned by some
of the greatest men of the Demo-jed
cratic party." He th?n called at
tention to the seve-o criticism miulo
by John Sharp Williams, Champ,
Clark, Speaker of the House, Senator.
Varddman, Representative Fitzgerald,
and many other Democratic members!
of the house and senate, wherein theyj
bemoaned the weakness of President
Wilson in his Mexican policy, his many
changes of mind in the dealings of,
thi? country with European countres,
hi? insistance of the repeal of the
free tolls bill, wherein American
coastwise vessels were to be permitted
to pass through the Panama canal
without the cost of tolls, and to the
huge extravagance in the appropria
tion of more money out of the public
funds than had ever before been done
by any congress.
Mr. Farr pointed to the claim of the
Democratis that Wilson had kept us
out of war, and then pointed out the
impossibility of this nation being
drawn into the war, and so thoroughly
exploded this foolish claim that when
he again alluded to it a ripple of
laughter spread through the audience.
He then took up their claim of great
prosperity, showed the cause of the
apparently good times as they now'
exist as due entirely to this country!
furnishing the warring nations with!
munitions. "If the Democrats get|
any satisfaction out of the prosperity
of this nation, won by the shedding'
of so much blood upon the battle-1
fields of Europe, the moans and groans
of the wounded and dying soldiers over
there, and the cruel poverty and help
lessness of the widows and orphaned
children of those nations, they are
more than welcome to it", stated Mr.
Farr, "For my part, I would a thous
and times rather be without that kind
of prosperity."
Throughout the entire address Mr.
Farr demonstrated his perfect famil
iarity wtih the conditions of the na
tion, and it was plainly evident that
he is well qualified to represent this

BIG SHEEP DEAL
CLOSED TUESDi% Y
Transaction
Involving Nearly Fifty
Thousasd Dollars.
Negotiations were completed last
Tuesday whereby Jos. Hanlon of Bil
lings, purchased several thousand head
of sheep from Jamieson & Murray,
and the deal is one representing about
[the largest financial transaction con
summated in the county for many
years. Mr. Hanlon took an option
on the sheep early last June and is
very well pleased with the deal ow
to the advance in values since
that time In speaking of the pre
vailing prices of all live stock and the
deal just completed Mr. Hanlon stat
that he looked for values to con
tinue high for at least another year,
"Sheep are higher than anyone ev
er imagined they could ever go," said
Mr. Hanlon. "I am well pleased with
the purchase I have just made of
Jamieson & Murray. During the
past ten years of dealings which I
have had with stockmen all over Mon
tana I have never dealt with men of
higher business integrity nor men
with whom it was more pleasant to
do business than the firm of Jamieson
& Murray. Despite the attempt to
create a sentiment detrimental to
their integrity made by Dave Rae,
who was acting as my agent, I wish
to distinctly state that they are abso
lutely reliable and it is a pleasure to
do business with them."
Mr. Hanlon will ship the sheep to
his feeding ranch in the Yellowstone
Valley at once.
COLEMAN HOTEL UNDER
NEW MANAGEMENT
Wednesday morning, November first,
S. C. Moore, assumed the management
of the Coleman Hotel. Mr. Moore
for the past two and a half years
has been the Secretary of the Glas
gow Commercial Club and during that
time has built up a wide circle of ac
quaintances, not only in Valley coun
ty but throughout the entire state.
He stated that it is his intentions to
make the Coleman Hotel the best place
in Glasgow from a standpoint of ser
vice and comfort so that those who
patronize it will be sure to return
j again when in the city.
I A large force of people are now at
! work in the hotel giving it a thorough
j renovating and when this work is done
the Coleman Hotel will be a very de
sirable place to stop.
SENTIMENT FOR MISS
RANKIN STILL GROWING
Favorable sentiment which has pre
vailed for many weeks with regard
to the candidacy of Miss Jeannette
Rankin whose election to congress on
the Republicas ticket is already gen
erally conceded, is still growing, and
predictions of the past week indicate
that Montana will send the first con
gresswoman to Washington with the
biggest majority ever given to any
candidate on any ticket in the state.
Huge crowds have gathered to hear
Miss Rankin wherever she has spok
en, and the ovations accorded her have
been phenomenal. In Great Falls
the opera house was packed to the
highest balcony, anl when Miss Ran
kin arose to speak, the demonstration
was so prolonged and so deafening
that it was several minutes before
"«he was allowed to begin her talk. In
Anaconda several hundred people were
turned away from the meeting, for
lack of standing room. Two halls
were packed in Butte, so that when
Miss Rankin finished speaking is one,
she was hurried to the next one, to
address an audience as great as that
in the first.
Miss Rankin has been speaking on
the tariff, the farm loan law the con
gressional duties regarding patents
and appropriations, and other nation
al questions, urging support for the
entire Republican ticket; and her abil
ity and knowledge and forceful speak
ing have won her unbounded admira
tion.
