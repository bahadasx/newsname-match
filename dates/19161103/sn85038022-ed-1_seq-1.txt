Ul-s a Little Political Hlslory-Tells
How "Conrt House Crowd" Tnrned
Oown MrDrrmott IS Months
Aa-o When He Wanted
Nomination For
(itnernor.
Forty years ago I cast my first vote
for Samuel J. Tllden for President- -since
that time I have followed Cleve
land, Hancock, Rryan, Parker and
Woodrow Wilson. I have always given
freely my time and money for the
cause of Democracy. 1 have never
asked a commission of my party or
shirked any duty Imposed. I notice
tli' Independent and Bulletin are
lauding former Lieutenant Governor
Ed J. McDcrmott, who is to clos' tin
Democratic campaign here Saturday.
This calls to my mind some political
happenings in MaBon county within
the past eighteen months. Mr. Mc
Dermott waa Lieutenant Governor
during the late McCrenry administra
tion and his records as such were ex
cellent, approved by bolli Democrats
and Republicans. Last year he an
nounced his candidacy for the Demo
cratic nomination for Governor. Ev
ery Democrat in Mason county, who is
at all acquainted with the recordB of
the contestants, knew he was entitled
to that nomination. Yet the organiza
tion, which by the way, Is the organ
ization today gave its undivided sup
port to another. So far as any one
knows, just one vote of what Is known
as the Court House Crowd was given
to McDermott and ho was allowed to
run third, and why?
Five years ago this crowd was for
McDermott, for Lieutenant Governor,
to save Jeems McCreary from certain
defeat, forcing Hon. Ren Johnson out
of the Governor race. This year with
an ignominious defeat staring them in
the face, they become desperate anil
Mr. McDermott is called upon to help
stem the tide. Mr. McDermott may
come and go. hut one thing Is certain
the result In Mason county will be
known when the totes are counted.
