Alma Erickson,, victim of some fiend

who was operated on in an effort to
save her life from peritonitis, died
yesterday morning at 7:30. The first
chapter in a tragedy which shocked

County Attorney John F. Ross im

on the body of the little girl to deter

George A. Bridge performed the au
topsy. None of the findings, howev
er, were made public yesterday,
though some astonishing and illumin
ating evidence is said to have been
uncovered.
Pending further study on the case,
the one charge, that of an illegal op
eration, stands against Dr. E. B. Wal
ker, of Lowell, who is alleged to be
to blame by the dying statement of
the girl. It is possible that the coun

Work was started on these cases

and then marched south 45 miles
against Parral. entering the town
from the north, which is the most ac
cessible way, they say.
These mining men declare that the
report of Villa's capture of the town
verifies the report that Villa and his
command had been in possession of
Santa Rosalia, as it was announced
that he would move on Parral from
Santa Roalia.

(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Nov. 2. President
Wilson, addressing a gathering of
business men from all parts of the
country at a luncheon here today, de
clared that "the men who constitute
what we have agreed to call 'Wall
Street,' have a subtle genius for prom
islng seemingly Immaterial changes"
when called into consultation con
cerning the affairs of the country
"which would eventually lead to the
defeat of the main objects of the ex

"Do you wonder." said the
President, "that I do not call
them into consultation and yet I
tell you again that they will be
welcome the moment -they come
to co-operate, and they will not
be welcome until then."
The President assured his audience
that the business interests of the
country had been safeguarded under
his administration and would contin
ue to be if he were reelected.

Mr. Wilson took his seat one of the
diners shouted:
"Three cheers for Wilson, the pro
gressive'" Instantly the crowd was
in an uproar hurling their napkins
into the air and cheering again.
In his speech to business men the
President said in p'art:
Human Side of Business
"We are living in a very serious
period of the world's history and
therefore it seems to me especially
encumbent upon us that we should, so
far as possible, search every question
to the heart. And when I think of
searching the business question to the
heart it seems to me that there are
some very large reckonings which
have too often been left out of the
count. When you think of the ulti
mate foundations of business yon
must know that you find them In the
conditions of national life and that
the particular conditions upon which
successful vital business depends are
the conditions which touch the daily
life of the common mass of people of
the country.
"Business is not a matter of organ
izing genius. Business is not wholly
matter of financial instinct. Busi
ness does not altogether consist of
seeing the opportunity and trying to
avail yourself of it. It consists in nav
Ing the source of strength to draw
from : and the only source of strength
for business, as for government, is to
have it founded on the whole people.
Remember Whole People
"The roots of business, my fellow
citizens. lie deep in the hearts and
breasts and daily lives of people who
crowd about as every day on the
street and on the countryside.
Exploitation Must Go
"And the thing that has disturbed
the thought of a great many men in
recent years in this country Is that
the general body of the people have
got the impression that they are be
ing drawn unon. in order that others
might prosper and they get the
crumbs from the table. v
