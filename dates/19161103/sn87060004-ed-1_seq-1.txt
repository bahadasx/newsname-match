INTERESTING LETTER
FROM THE BORDER
Some-of the Things the Boys
of Co. G arc Doing in the
' Lone Star State
Fort Bliss, Texas.
Camp Owen Bieme
Oct. 20, 1016.
No doubt the good - people of the
City of Earlington and the friends
and relations of the members of Co.
G think we are a very ungrateful set
for the many kindnesses bestowed
upon us during our short" stay we
had in the city after being called out
for duty for the old United States.
However, we take this way of thank
ing them and let them know that
they will be long remembered in our
minds and hearts Their way of
nuking our tasks of leaving home,
presumably to goto war, easier is
still fresh in our minds and we hope
that they will receive the true bless
ings due to such workers in their
final reward.
Although losing several of our
members through the Federal exam
ination we still have a very good
company with a tQtal of 3" men,
due to the arrival of several new re
cruits, and a finer bunch of men was
never assembled into a company to
the writer's knowledge.
As the papers gave an almost ac
curate account of our maneuver
while at our concentration camp I
will not go info any details regard
ing our stay there except that all re
port a very good time whi'e there.
However, since arriving here the reg
ular army officers have played havoc
with us. Instead of having a lighter
routine it seems a&Jhough we are a
new bunch of Tecruits, comparing
our drills and duties with our form
er ones. However, no grumbling or
disorder is heard among i he boys.
They all seem to enjoy the four
hours drill each day.
As to the hike the other organiza
tions will long remember the way
the Kentucky boys led them into El
Paso on the return. If any reports
are put that we had any hardships on
the trip they must be disregarded as
every one seemed to have a good
time. Also I must say the Kentucky
brigade came out on top with the best
records. We had only fifteen men
out of the whole brigade that had to
be sent to the hospital while the next
to us was South Carolina with 66.
Personals of Co. G
We have an almost Camnza and
Which Do You Prefer?
It is important for reasons of health and
practical economy for every housekeeper
to ask herself this question:
"Do I prefer a pure baking powder like
Royal, made of cream of tartar derived from
grapes, or am I willing to use a baking
powder made of alum or phosphate,' both
derived from mineral sources?"
The names of tho ingredients printed
on the label show whether the kind you
are now using or any brand, new or oW,'
that may beroffered is a genuine cream
of tartar powder, or merely a phosphate
or alum compound.
Royal Baking Powder contains no alum
nor phosphate,

ISSUES OF THE CAMPAIGN
The Underwood Tariff Law put most of the farmer's products on the
free list, The duties were removed from cattle, ihsep, eggs, milk, cream,
wool, beef, mutton, and corn. The rates were reduced about 60 pjr cent
on poultry, butter, cheese, hay and horses. Every farmer knows that there
was an immediate slump in the prices of his products which continued un
til the European war began. When
dition will prevail.
On May 24, 1914, after ten months of the Underwood tariff law near
ly four million workers were out of
and bankruptcses occured every day. On that date a delegation of business
men, protesting at the White House against the operations of the Underwood
tariff law, were told by Mr. Wilson that the condition was "merely psy
chological." i
Tne so-called "eight-hour law" is now well understood to be misnamed.
It is a wage increase, arbitrarily fixed by a democratic Congress at the orders
of a then frightened President, and no reference whatever to length of hours
of labor. In the President's demand for this legislation he abandoned the
principle of arbitration, thereby infliciting on labor a great damage.
President Wilson has done nothing about the murder of more than
five hundred American citizens in Mexico and the unspeakable outrages per
petrated by Mexican bandits on American women and children, and the
outrages still continue.

Kentucky Solflier'sjlea
When wo soldiers cams to Texas,
Wo were happy and lauged and sang ;
And wanted to cross the Border,
To the tune of our rifle's bang.
But after being here awhile,
We found we were all wrong:
For the trip to Mexiao Oity,
Is several miles too long.
"Gosh," eafd we It's awful,
But we should give a hang;
K neoessacy we'll still cross the
Border,
To the tune of our rifle's bang.
But when came that hiking,
We sure did rare and snort;
And yelled out loud to Unole Sam
To cut that hiking short.
Said "Sammle," that yellings awful
But I will their Jackets warm;
I'll make 'em bust that Texas sand
It will do 'em no harm.
So for fifteen days he hiked us
Through that Texas sand,
And when the bike was finished.
The Devil owned every man.
And we-now are saying,
To the idea we no long6r hang,
Of going across the Border,
To the tune of our rifle's bang.
So lets not be selfish Sammy,
With the peace tho Mexicans laok,
But to our happy bome In Kentucky
riease sir: aana us Daok.
For the state of old Kentucky,
Means most of all to us,
S3 please Sir: send us home
Aud let the Mexicans fusi.

ISSUE
VIRGINIA DRY,
ISJ8TH STATE
Law One of Most Drastics
Ever Passed by a Legislature-
800 Saloons Closed
Richmond, Va., Nov. 1 Vir
ginia the eighteenth stato to bint
the sale of intoxicating beverage
closed all saloons at midnight.
Although a large part of the old
dominion previously had been
voted dry in local option elections,
the new state law closed more
than 800 ealoons, mostly in Kich
mond, Norsolk, Newport Newo,
Lynchburg, Petersburg, Roanoke
and Bristol
The Jaw is oae of the most
drastic ever passed by a stato
legislature. No beverage except
cider can bo sold that shows a
trace of alchol and possession of
more than ono galllon of whiskey,
ono gallon of wine, or three gal
lons of beer would be regrrded aa
prima facie evidence of intent to
violate the law. This provision,
probably will receive an early
tost in court, as vast quantities
of liquor have been stored in pri
vate homes.
