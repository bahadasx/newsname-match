HIGHER RENTS
MERE BUGABOO
OWNER STATES
Dr. John Ocnslager, One of
City's Biggest Landlords,

INCREASE NEGLIGIBLE
However, if Direct Taxation
Is Necessary, Renter Will
Be "Soaked"
Higher rent possibilities as an argu
ment against the passage next Tues
day of tho high school loan was depre
cated to-day as a mere bugaboo by
Dr. John Oenslager, one of the city's
biggest owners of tenant properties.
Floating of the $1,250,000 loan will
naturally mean in time an increase to
some extent in taxation, he pointed
out, but the effect on the "ultimate
consumer," the renter of houses,
should be scarcely noticeable.
If. however, the school authorities
are compelled, because of the failure
of the people to consent to borrowing
the necessary money to provide addi
tional school facilities, to raise the
money by direct taxation Immediately,
the burden naturally must be borne
by the taxpayer and then in turn by
the "ultimate consumer," the renter of
houses.
The Need of the Ix>an
Finally, Dr. Oenslager emphasized
(lie necessity for providing increased
high school facilities.
Dr. Oenslager talked on the loan
and the incident problem of increased
taxation and its results In answer to
some questions on the subject pro
pounded by a Telegraph reporter.
"Opponents of the school loan have
advanced the argument that the pass
age of tho measure will mean such an
increased burden of taxation as will
cause a raising of rents from a dollar
to three dollars a month. As one of
the city's larger renters of tenant
properties. Dr. Oenslager, what is your
opinion on the subject?" he was asked.
The Ultimate Consumer
"Why, to my mind, the increase in
rents, if there lie any increase neces
sary, will be negligible," he replied.
"Of course you do not mean that a
raise In taxation will not. ultimately
affect the man who nays rent*?"
"Certainly not. The ultimate con
sumer must bear his share of the cost
of the freight, and in this instance it is
Ihe tnan who rents his house as well
as the owner of tho property. It is

ASSAILS WILSON
FOR FAILURE TO
CUT LIVING COST
Hughes Makes Tariff His
Theme and Cites Broken
Promises
ENDING CAMPAIGN TOUR
G. O. P. Nominee Has Spoken
in Thirty-Three States in
Four Trips
Hudson, N. Y., Nov. 3. ln his
speech here to-day Charles E. Hughes
made the tariff his chief theme and
assailed the Democratic party for its
failure to reduce the high cost of
living.
"I think they were just as eloquent
in promises four years ago as they
are to-day," Mr. Hughes said. "As I
look back to the statements that were
made at that time, I cannot see how
any one could have said anything
more eloquently, more persuasively
than was said at that time with respect
to what was going to be done for
American labor and American busi
ness. You would have thought at that
time that the sun of promise had just,
begun to shine upon a benighted world
and that they were going to have an
entirely new condition and that labor
would profit to the utmost and Am
erican business would get an extra
ordinary incentive.
"They told us, for example, that
there was the high cost of living,
j Well, we all knew that; we had very
intimate knowledge of that fact; but
what was still more to the point, they
told us that they were going to re
duce it and that if we would put them
in power they would show us how the
high cost of living was going to come
down. Well, through a division in our
ranks, which I am glad to say, has
been happily healed, they had a
chance to show what they could do
with this high cost of living.
Reduced Chances of Earning
"That robust companion, however,
has become more and more robust,
and seems to thrive on a Democratic
administration. And it is mounting
higher and higher and taller and
taller when we consider this promise
in relation to present promises, we
wonder whether they are going to do
any better with respect to the future
than they did in these recent years
with respect to this highly important
matter. While they did not reduce
the cost of living they were eminently
successful in reducing the chances of
making a living. They did not promise
that: they promised quite tho con
trary; they had a wonderful pro
gram; they were going to reduce tho
cost of living; they were going to pro
vide for the expenses of the govern
ment through their tariff system; they
were going to increase tiie opportuni
ties for business and they were going
to have American enterprise, as they
said, take on a new size and speed
and have opportunities for American
labor multiplied.
Opportunities Vanished
"Well they put their principle in
force. They had not had a chance to
do it for a great many years. They
proceeded to do it with very extra
ordinary results. In the first place
| they had a tariff for revenue only, but
it was a tariff that did not produce
revenue. We had a great falling off
in revenue through a tariff for
revenue, while we had a great In
crease of imports and so in time of
peace which now they emphasize, for
getting the little wars we have had in
Mexico, they had to pass what is
called a war revenue bill to take care
of the deficit which was the result of
their fiscal policy.
"Then they said they were going to
have American enterprise take on a
new size and speed and it did, a much
reduced size and a much slower speed.
The opportunities of labor vanished
or were greatly reduced and we had
very extraordinary conditions in this
country."
Mr. Hughes will end his travels
as a presidential candidate to-day.
He left Albany at 8.15 o'clock
this morning for New York city,
spending the day" campaigning down
the Hudson river valley. To-day's
journey was the windup of four cam
paign trips which have carried him ap
proximately 25.000 miles through 33
States. He started August 5 from
New York and spent virtually two and
one-half months on the road, not
counting the three brief periods of
rest that have punctuated his cam
paign. During his campaign he has
visited the chief cities of every north
ern and New England State except
Vermont, has been through the Mid
dle West four times and has appeared
in every Western and Northwestern
State.

POLICE FAIL TO
CATCH BURGLARS
WHO START FIRE
After Robbing Pool Room on
Hill, Yegginen Set Place
Ablaze
City police and detectives after a
thorough search all day failed to get
any definite clues in their investi
gation to discover the burglars who
robbed the poolroom of H. A. Schriver,
1236 Market street, early this morning
and then set lire to the place, with a
loss of $4,000.
Shortly afterward the blaze was dis
covered and nn alarm sent in from
Box 7, Thirteenth and Market streets.
District firemen after a hard battle
with the fire prevented a heavy loss to
other buildings adjoining the pool
room. The loss will not exceed $4,000
and is almost totally covered by insur
ance.
Thieves Knew Ground
The thieves who are responsible for
tilt- fire, according to the police, are
well acquainted with the district. After
entering the poolroom they took more
than sl4 from the cash register and
then remo\ed a small safe containing
$270. This has not been found. Ac
cording to Fire Chief John C. Kindler,

TO REMOVE BAN
ON ICE CREAM
Has Been Up to City Standard
During Last Two
Weeks
Dr. J. M. J. Raunick, city health
officer, announced late this afternoon
that he will remove the health de
partment ban on ice cream in an of
ficial statement to-morrow.
For more than two months this has
been standing, Dr. Raunick declar
ing that the ice cream was so badly
contaminated that people should not
eat it. During the last two weeks
ice cream manufactured in the city
with few exceptions has been up to
the health department standard, and
as the typhoid epidemic is over Dr.
Kaunick said to-day that the ban
will be removed.
Ice cream and milk reports for tlie
last two weeks of October, announced
to-day at the City health department
offices, show that the supply from
many of the manufacturers aiid deal
ers for that period was the best since
the beginning of the typhoid fever
eptdemic in August. Six of the
twenty-five tests made of the milk
supply showed the presence of disease
germs, ranging from 500 to 3800 per
cubic centimeter. Two of these tests
were made by request of A. F. Hudy.
The othor contaminated samples
were obtained from W. IJ. Knighton,
F. M. Ortmeyer, C. Ott and the Penn
sylvania Milk Products company.
Two ice cream samples showed the
presence tjf disease germs, but all of
the other ones were pure. One sam
ple taken from cream manufactured
by J. S. Wilson contained 47,500
germs per cubic centimeter and the
cream was condemned and conflis
catcd. The other sample was that of
Uuss Brothers but contained only 300
diseuse germs per cubic centimeter.

British shipping sustained losses!
