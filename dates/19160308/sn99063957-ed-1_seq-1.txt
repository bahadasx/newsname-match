Thousands of Troops Massed
to Charge Across Pontoons
When Laid
SLOPES OF GOOSE HILL
A LABRYNTH OF MINES
Onslaught at Douaumont and
Advance from Fresnes
Expected
London, Mar. 8. Under a storm of
bIh'IIs from three aide, a handful of
French troops are still holding the ruins
of Kogneville, seven miles northwejt
of Verdun, dispatches declared.
As part of their major "nut crack
er" attacked against Verdun, the crown
prince's men have driven in wedges on
euch side of Kogneville, so the village
is almost two-thirds surrounded and
in danger of being crushed.
From their newly won positions on
the east bank of the Meuse, the Ger
mans arc hurling tons of projectiles
into the village. Covered by this fire,
(lermau engineers aro trying to throw
pontoon bridges across the Meuse just
Houth of Reguevillc. Thousands of teu
ton soldiers are held in reserve close
by, ready to charge across three bridges
and into the town.
French aeroplanes, hovering over the
(iormnn lines, have returned to head
cpiai'ters with reports which convince
the French leaders that the crown
prince is about to renew his onlaughts
against General I'etain's center at Dou
aumont. They also look for an attempt
to advance from Fresnes, reported cap
tured yesterday.
Repeated German infantry attacks on
the summit of Goose Hill have failed.
Their dead carpet the slopes. Heavy
Teuton artillery is being hurried for
ward to blnst the French from the
crown of this eminence and clear the
way for a successful infantry charge.
Goose Hill a Death Trap.
The loss of Forges and of Hill 205
is not regarded by the allies as very
important, but critics arc warning them
the Germans may make their boldest
strike in that region, northwest of Ver
dun. In order to continue their advance,
the Germans must charge up the side of
Goose Hill. In anticipation of such a
smash, the French have made the 1,Ud(
yards of barren, rocky slope into a
veritable death trap. Every foot of it
is mined, and behind the French lines
engineers wait to touch electric but
tons which would send whole sections
of the district skyward in a burst of
t'lnme and hurl hundreds of men into
eternity nt a single blow. Besides these
mines, the ground is covered with n
maze of barbed wire entanglement and
cut up with pitfalls.
Troops could make but slow progress
over it, and as they advanced among
mines, pitlulls and barbed wire ihey
would be constantly exposed to a con
centrnted fire 'from all the French ma
chine guns on Goose Hill. It is estimat
ed it would cost the Oermnns 10.000
lives to storm Goose Hill, but critics
mlinit it might be worth the price.
Berlin is strangely silent regarding
the most important fighting to the
northwest of Verdun. Even French re
ports of German gains are not confirm
ed by Berlin. The messages from the
"crmiin capital are chieflv with regard
to preparations for the renewal of the

Afraid German American Con
troversy May Get Latter
Into War
By Charles P. Stewart.
(I'nited Press Staff Correspondent.)
London, Mar. 8. Almost overnight
Great Britain's views on the German
American situation has radically
changed. The belief is gnrwing that re
lations nre more tense, and the possibil
ity of war is seriously considered.
Danish and Dutch reports say Ger
many's bitterness toward the I'nited
States is increasing. It is not known
whether this is due to congress uphold
ing President Wilson's submarine
policy.
War insurance brokers and others
hitherto disinclined to regard the situ
ation seriously nre now alive to the pos
sibilities of a German-American break.
Afternoon newspapers emphasized
this view. Their headlines called at
tention to Wilson's Washington tri
umph and such phrases as '"decks
cleared for action ' anil wnson de
fies German piracy" were numerous.
Some still believe Germany will yield
to America.

nounced today. The situatiou north of
Verdun was reported unchanged.
The cannonade was heaviest north
west of Verdun where the Germnns are
believed preparing for an attempt to
captured Goose and Dead Man Hills.
Infantrymen stayed in their trenches
northwest of Verdun last night while
Germans shelled French positions, the
communique tsaid. Regarding other
operations it announced:
"East of Maison De Champagne we
captured trenches which the enemy
took last Monday, and took 85 prison
ers.' '
Along the Manheullcs railway and
road, near Fresnes, several German at
tacks broke down under artillery fire.
The French artillery devoted its at
tention principally to Blanzey and Rim
ncourt east of Fort Mouluinville.
Germans Make Gains.
Berlin, Mar. 8. German capture of
Forges, Regneville, Ruben anil C'umicres

Germans Advance Two Miles.
Berlin, Mar. 6. West of Regneville
on the west bank of the Meuse river
the Germans have stormed a front of
three and a half miles below Bethin
court for a gain of nearly two miles, it
was officially announced today. Last
night's gains were the largest since the
battle tor erdun began.
The capture of Regneville, seven
miles northwest of Verdun, and Forges.
eii'ht miles northwest, was claimed of
ficinlly. Positions on Raben Heights
and in the Cumieries woods were also
declared to have been seized. Germans
drove the French from the few houses
they still held in Fresnes, capturing

the jaws of the giunt Germnn "nut

Berlin reported the right jaw seized
Regneville, the French being ousted
in hand to hand combats from the few
wrecked houses they still held there.
The loss of Forges to the Teutons, pre
viously admitted by Paris, was an
nounced by Berlin.
Twelve miles southeast of Verdun
the left jnw swept forward across the
Woevre plain. Fresnes was reported
entirely in German possession.
On the west bank of the Mcuse, west
of Regneville, a two mile gain was
officially claimed by Berlin. Along
a front of three and a half miles the
Teutons stormed French trenches. This
is the largest gain since the Verdun

out the railroad now claims the right

WILSON WILL TAKE
VIGOROUS ACTION
TO SETTLE DISPUTE
Washington, Mar, 8. With his hands
unleashed by the action of congress in
refusing to warn Americans off armed
liners, President Wilson today prepared
to resume his submarine negotiations
with Germany. Prompt action in both
the German and the British controver
sies is expected.
While seeking more definite Germnn
assurances with regard to the Teuton
armed merchantman campaign and urg
ing an immediate execution of the Lus
ita nia and Arabic reparation pledges,
the administration will investigate the
alleged secret orders of the British ad
miralty for armed ships to attack sub
marines on sight. State department ex
perts have translated the appendices
submitted to this government by Ger
many in support of the claim that such
orders exist. With photographic copies
of the alleged orders the appendices arc
ready for action by Secretary Lansing.
German Ambassador Von Bernstorff ar
ranged to confer with Lansing at 11
o 'clock.
All adherents of the administration
expressed keen satisfaction at the house
vote tabling McLemore's warning reso
lution. The final ballot of 270 to 142 demon
strated to the satisfaction of adminis
tration supporters that congress stands
behind the president in his feelings to
ward Europe.

CONSTITUTION TO BE
AM OF CONFERENCE
Delegates to Irrigation Con
ference Will Work for
Success at Polls
Nearly 100 delegates to tho State
Irrigation, Diainnge and Rural Credits
conference will meet at the state house
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock to con
sider the advisability of submitting a
constitutional amendment to the people
of this state providing for tho issuance
of bonds for draijiage, irrigation and
rural credits. One of the first subjects
to he considered is whether or not to
consider irrigation, drainage and rural
credits together, or whether to con
sider irrigation and drainage together
and rural credits separately. Others
who will be present at the conference
consider that each topic properly be
longs in a separate class.
Tho present conference was suggest
ed at the Oregon Irrigation congress at
its fifth annual session which was held
in Portland l'emlvT 28, 29 and 30,
1015. At this time The cotigress urged
the adoption of an amendment to the
state constitution to provide for the
features to be proposed and a commit
tee of five was appointed to call the
state conference together. The confer
ence can only advise by resolutions. It
is expected that a constitutional amend
ment will be drafted providing for the
issuance of bonds nnd that the con
ference will take the necessary stepB
and perfect the necessary organization
to secure the placing of these measures
upon the ballot at the next general
state election and to conduct the cam
paign necessary to secure their adoption
by the voters of the state.
Tho conference is to be made up of
85 accredited delegates to be composed
of the president nnd four members of
each of the following organizations:
The Oregon State Grange.
Farmers' Educational and Co-operative
Union.
Oregon Federation of Labor.
Portland Chamber of Commerce.
One delegate to be named by each of
the 'following rnilroads:
Northern Pacific.
Great Northern.
Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navi
gation company.
Spokane-Portland & Seattle railway.
Southern Pacific.
Portland Railway Light & Power
company.
Oregon Development league.
Oregon Drainage a.-aoclation.
(Continued on Pe ThrM.)
Congress still seethed today on the
armed liner issue, it was believed in
other debate might break out ut any
tune and continue indefinitely. Several
representatives aio expected to seize
the first opportunity of explaining
their votes on the warning resolution.
Senator Stone hns indefinitely post
poned his explanation but many others
contemplate speeches.
Bickering with regard the effect of
the" house vote also promises to con
tinue. Those opposed to the adminis
tration argued that the merits of the
real issue whether Americans should
be warned to keen off armed liners
was still unsettled. The agitation for
such i wnming is expected to continue,
but the chance that there will be an
other vote on the proposition is very
remote.
Advocates of a warning pointed out
the roll calls showed there was a real
division between President Wilson and
congress on the armed liner policy of
the administration. The White House,
however, felt there wis no danger of
Germnnv misconstruing the president's
overwhelming support in congress.
The political effect of tho contest is
in doubt. More defections, besides
those of Representatives Page and
Sherwood, are expected. Republicans,
it is believed, will enlarge on the ad
ministration's refusal to permit a vote
on the merits of issuing a warning.
ALKALI CHEMICAL

Terrific Explosion Sends Roof

Locomotives, Cars and Ma
chinery Lie In Tangled
Mass In Yards
Niagara, Falls, N. Y., Mar. 8. With
one man known to be dead, a score
missine the entire fire department of
Niagara Falls fought today to save the
Niagara Alkali Chemical company's
plant, where fire started with a ter
rific exidosion shortly before midnight.
The chemical company manufactures
nitrate as a byproduct for several pow
der companies. It was also understood
to have on hand an immense number of
direct war orders.
The fire started with an explsion in
the peroxide building nnd 12 or 15
even moro violent blasts followed in
quick succession. The city was rocked
as by an earthquake, while the pcroxido
plant was blown to pieces.
Just before 9 o'clock today i new
series of eight explosions again shook
the plant. They developed a new fire,
which rapidly approached the storage
house. Should the blaze reach this
store house more explosions demolish
ing the entire plant and possibly dam
aging Adjoining portions of the city are
feared.
Officials aro unable to estimate the
number of men in the peroxide building
when the first blast occurred. Severn
guards asserted thore were between 75
and 150. Their escape through poison
ous gases was considered miraculous.
The peroxide plant contained apparatus
for manufacture of large percentage of
all chloroform used in the country.
Firemen and police were helpless to
aid any men who may have been trap
ped inside, on account of tho great heat
and the danger of explosions which ex
tended over four hours.
Terrific Force of Explosion.
The peroxide building was of brick
and steel, 300 feet long by 75 wide.
The first explosion shot tho roof with
its massive girders 100 feet high. It
landed several hundred feet away.
Steel tanks 20 feet high and fifteen
feet wide were shot through a three
foot brick wall like projectiles. One
sank in the Niagara river 100 yards
distant. A string of freight cars two
blocks away were bowled over nad a
huge electric hauling locomotive de
molished. Machinery of every descrip
tion was heaped around the yard in
tangled, twisted masses.
Firemen were unable to turn streams
O'l the ruins because fresh explosions
occurred when the water struck the
burning debris.
Tho plant has been closely guarded
since the recent dynamite explosion in
another part of it.
Dr. H. K. Carvath, general head of
tiie company, said the concern had been
linking sodium peroxide for years. He
concluded that the explosions and fire
were not accidental. Carvath believed
all in the building had been accounted
for with one dead and one fatally hurt.
The room in which explosives are
stored is separated from the burning
building by a thick fire wall, but the
dror.1 have burned through and an ex
plosion dwarfing the earlier blasts is
expected. Officials and firemen crouch
ed waiting behind other buildings, pow
erless. Market Was Sluggish
But Prices Advance
(Copyrighted 111 Hi, by the New York
Evening Post.)
New York, Mar. H. The market was
again extremely irregular today with a
bewildering mixture of advances and
declines. This might have been ascrib
ed to simultaneous news of the house
vote to support the administration's
foreign policy and the German success
es at Verdun.
Whatever the cause, the confusion
lasted until tho closing hour when
Washington's indication of some pros
pect of removing the submarine dif
ficulty started a vigorous, general ad
vance. I
The extent to which Berlin's new and
more amicable attitude seemed destined
to straighten out existing diplomatic
crisis remains tn be seen. The market,
however, continued to reflect distinct
reassurance, ending tho day strong and
active.

pels Drastic Action
Washington, Mnr. 8. Ambassador
Von Bernstorff 's memorandum on the
armed liner controversy, handed Secre
tary Lansing today, gave a full ex
planation of the reasons for the decree
ordering submarines to torpedo armed
belligorcnts without warning.
The memorandum said the decree was
necessitated by the numerous violations
of international law on the part of the.
allies. Grcnt Britain was named as art
especial offender. Tho memorandum,
said the I'nited Stntes had acknow
ledged theso violations.
Great Britain's blockade of Germany"
was specified as being contrary to in
ternational law in that it kept neutral
trade from German ports, and made ex
port of German goods impossible
Tho blockade, according to the mem
orandum, hampers trndo between neu
trals by extending the contraband pro
visions.
Other alleged offenses named were)
tho interception of mail, with intent
to halt German intercourse with for
eign countries, tho attempt to starve
civilians of the central powers by re
stricting neutral trndo, and tho tu-inna
prisoners of German civilana on tho
high sens.
Allied merchantmen, the document
charged, were srmed for offensive not
for defensive purposes.
All these charges except one are ius-
tificd, tho memorandum alleges, by
specifically quoted American note.
Tho exception is with regard to tha
seizure of civilians nt sea.
The communication said:
"In order to "fight our opponents'
moamircs, which arc absolutely contrary
to international law, Germany chose
now weapons which had not been regu
lated by international law. In doing;
so she did not and could not violiit
any existing rule, but only took into,
account tho peculiarity of this new
weapon the submnrino. "
Germany's willingness to operate her
submarines under rules governing naval
warfnro in tho past is pointed out in
tho note, provided, howover, that Great
Britain makes concessions with regard
to arming merchantmen, and "ceas
her attempt to starve Germany's civil
population."
Germany's Last Word.
Washington, Mar. 8. Germany's lat
est memorandum, delivered to the state
department today, may he its last word,
in tha armed liner controversy.
Tho memorandum mny be summarized
in two sentences. The fact it was deliv
ered today is regarded as significant,
immediately following, as it does th
congressional vote to lenve further ne
gotiations to President Wilson nnd tha
slate department.
The suggestion that allied concessions)
might modify the kniser's decree of war
without mercy nguiust armed liners ws
renewed in tho note. This is interpret
ed as showing Germany hones America
may resnmo its attempt to have the nl
lies disarm merchantmen, permitting
further discussion of the question.
Tha administration's next course of
action has not yet been announced.
Secretary Lansing spent tho day study
ing tho appendices nnd photographic
copies of alleged British orders for
armed liners to attack submarines. It
is understood that if the state depart
ment acts it will submit copies of tha
appendices to the British embassy first.
It was explained at the state depart
ment, however, that if investigation
proved certain ships were offensively
armed, the government would feel justi
fied in declaring them auxiliary cruis
ers. This in itself would absolve th
government of responsibility for possi
ble deaths of Auiericnns aboard them.
