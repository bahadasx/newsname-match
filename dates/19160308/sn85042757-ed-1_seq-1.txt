tinued to grow worse until Friday
morning when she too passed away.
The reujains were brought to the
home of her father-in-law, E. L. Lem

Mrs. Lemert came here three years

disposition won for her many friends
who were deeply grieved at her un
timely death. Every possible mani
festation of esteem and kindness was
shown to the bereaved friends. Flow
ers were sent in profusion and friends
gathered at the Lemert home to lend

deep pangs of sorrow.
Seldom has it happened that any per
son has come among our people who
has been so universally admired and
esteemed as was Mrs. Lemert and ex-
oressions of sorrow and regret were
bearo from many when it became
known that she had passed away. Es
pecially was she beloved by the young
people here, and "Hessie as she was

To the bereaved husband the entire
community extends the deepest sym
pathy.

Saturday, February 2a, Oaniel Man
ning, Uncle Dan as he is best
known by his many friends, was pleas
fantly surprised by his relatives and
friends on bis 88th birthday with a
splendid dinner at his home, Linaria.
The surprise was made the more
complete by reason of his relatives and
friends preparing the dinner at their
homes and taking it to bis home on the
eventful day. As his birthday comes
February 29 it will be seen that he has
a birthday only once in tour years.
While the surprise was complete and
very enjoyable t all present it was
rendered n;0re so by the fact that it
could Sot occur again for four years
and that is a long time when one has
passed the four score mark as has
"Uncle Oan. "
There were 16 cakes, 60 pies and cus
tards and other good things in propor
tion. Owing to the cold weather and
snow not so many persons were present
as would otherwise have been. Includ
ing friends, grandchildren and great
grandchildren there were 42 persons
present and after all bad dined sump
tuously there was left enough tempting
good things to have supplied one hun
dred people.
He is the father of Ave daughters
living, four of them being present.
Grandchildn n and great grandchtidren
were present to the number of 27. He
is the fatln , grandfather and great
grandfather c E 182 people.
For many e; rs "Uncle Dan" Man
mng was er ?agen in buying cattle for
eastern market t.nd has driven many
thousand cattle from this and adjoin
ing counties. I ' used to be said of him
that he could come nearer weighing a
steer with his eye than any man who
ever bought cattle in this section. He
used to buy them by the hundred and
drive them to Virginia in the fall. He
has bought thousands of cattle without
paying a cent down on mem. ine
owners were satisfied to wait until he
returned from market for their money.
No man ever lost a cent on him and he
has tandled many thousand head of fat
cattle during the many yesrs he was
engaged in the business. He began as
a boy and used to go on foot and help
drive the cattle to Virginia. Later he
beuran buying and continued to do so
until age prevented him from undergo
ing the bard strain of the work.
He is hearty and strong ror one or
his years and his many friends will
wish for him many more birthdays of
the same happy kind as the last one.

WAR SITUATION.
The tight for the possesison and de
fense of the forts of Verdun, France,
continues with little abatement of
fury. Losses to both sides are appall
ing, but more is neara oi me iierman
losses than of the French. The Ger
mans have made some important gains,
but on the whole the French seem to
be holding them to the same lines of
several days ago.
Or other fronts, except in the Poland
region, righting is at a practical stand
still. The Russians have attempted
some heavy advances against the Ger
mans in Poland, but the Germans
claim the effort accomplished nothing.
The German sea raider, Moewe, has
safely reached a German port, it is
claimed. She is said to have carried
200 prisoners and gold barB amounting
to one million marks, about sudu.uou.
She is said to have sunk fifteen enemy
ships.
VACANCY FILLED.
The barn of J. J. Beyers was burned
at bis home near Lantana, Sunday
night about eight o'clock. A consider
able quantity ot hay, over 50 bushels
of corn and a team of mules were
burned. The mules were gotten out of
the burning barn, but were in such a
badly burned condition that they had
to be killed. The loss to Mr. Beyers
is elose to flOOO. The barn was built
new last fall and cost close to $500.
When the fire was discovered by the
family the barn was so completely en
veloped in flames that it was impossi-
ble to save anything. The team of
mules were gotten out but their eyes
were burned out and otherwise so bad
ly burned that they were killed. The
harness belonging to the team was also
lost. Mr. Beyers had only one team.
Every indication points to it having
been tired-by some evil-minded person.
But why they should inflict such a loss
on Mr. Beyers is past understanding
as he is a quiet, industrious and honest
man, a good neighbor and molests no
person.
it Will be remembered that a few
months ago a stick of dynamite ex
ploded in a stump that had been placed
in the tire in the home of Mr. Beyers
and as a result Mrs. Beyers was very
seriously injured and that her life was
almost despaired ot and it feared she
would lose one eye. However she has
almost recovered and the eye also, but
this disaster coming as it did has
shocked ber to such an extent that ser
ious conditions may result.
Mrs. W. M. Seiby, sister of Mrs.
Beyers, was in. town Monday ctreuiat
ing a petition in favor of Mr. Beyers
and she secured several dollars. Mr.
Beyers is well known here and respect
ed by all who know him. His loss is
deeply regretted by all.

Newton D. Baker, former mayor of
Cleveland, Ohio, and a close personal
friend of the president tor many years,
has been chosen as secretary o? war to
succeed Lindley M. Garrison, recently
resigned.
Mrs. Hester Gilmore Lemert, aged
twenty-two, wife of Nathan Lemert,
passed from this life Friday morning,
March 3rd. She was taken suddenly ill
with uremic poisoning Monday night.
Feb. 28th, and although she was given
every attention possible, it waa of no
avail.
Her father and mother, Mr. and Mrs.
Gilmore, of Kansas, who were spend
ing the winter in Florida, arrived at
her bedside Wednesday. The body was
removed Friday to the home ot her
father-in-law, E. L. Lemert, in Cross
ville, where it was prepared tor re
moval ; and early Saturday morning
the remains, accompanied by her hus
band, her parents, and brother-in-law,
Milo Lemert, left I iroisvilie ror her
childhood homo in Highland, Kansas,
where the interrment was to take place
Monday.
Besides her husband and parents, the
deceased is survived by a sister and
two brothers.
Mrs. Leineri came to the Cumber
lands three years ago last summer as a
bride, and her sweet, lovable personal
ity, and generous nature soon won for
her many friends in her new home.
Her happy smile and ever-ready wit
will be missed wherever she was
known. The young couple were unus
ually devoted to each other, and this
untimely departure of his companion
will be very hard for the young hus
band to bear.
As wife, daughter, sister, and friend
the deceased leaves a wide circle to
mourn her deatb. It is needless to say
that the deep sympathy of Pomona, as
well as the whole county, goes forth to
the bereaved ones m their hour ot sor
row.
March 6. O. B.
The conference called last week in
Nashvil'e, with the view to settling
the differences existing between the
leaders, proved an entire success and
the party will go into the fight this fall
n the state with a solid and united
front presented to the common enemy.
In the adjustment Senator Newell
Sanders and Congressman Sam R. Sells
both withdrew as candidates for na
tional committeeman and John J. (J re,
of Gainesboro, was named for that
place.
J. b. Beasley will resign as state
chairman and J. Will Taylor is to suc
ceed Mr. Beasley. Nothing was men
tioned relative to the race for United
States senator or governor. The feel
ing is kthat former Governor Hooper
will be the candidate for the serrate
and the race tor govenor will be be
tween Juage H. B. Lindsley, of Knox-
ville, and J. W. Overall, of Middle
Tennessee.
It is probable that Hooper, Sanders,
Sells and H. Clay Evans will be the
delegates at large to the republican
national convention at Chicago.
The result of the conference is called
no one's victory as concessions were
made by both sides. Senator Sanders
is credited with being the strongest
factor for bringing about peace conditions.

Most Important Line of Southern Rail
way tn Re a Fquipped.
Washington. D. C, February 28. in
order that it may extend the use of the
telephone for dispatching trains over
the entire line from Alexandria, Va.,
to Salisbury, N. C, 830 miles, South
ern Kaiiway has authorized tne con
struction of two telephone circuits be
tween Alexandria and Monroe, Va.,
160 miles.
Work will be begun as soon as iorces
can be organized and tne necessary
material secured.
Between Monroe and Salisbury the
Southern has used the telephone for
dispatching trains for a number of
years and the results have been so sat
isfactory as to justify an extension of
this system.
The telephone has several advantages
over the telegraph. Service is quicker
and it is easier to guard against errors.
The dispatcher writes the order as he
sends it, spelling out all figures such
as train numbers, engine numbers, and
time. The receiver writes the mes
sage as he receives it and then repeats
it to the dispatcher, spelling out all
figures. The telephone brings the
sender and receiver into close touch
and the dispatcher, should occasion
arise, can talk personally to the con
ductor or engineer of any train on his
division.
The line between Alexandria and
Salisbury is a very important part of
the Washington-Atlanta line and the
Southern Railway has provided every
facility for moving a heavy business
over ' it safely and expeditiously.
Double track is now being constructed
and automatic electric block signals in
stalled on all parts of it not already so
equipped. The addition of the tele
phone dispatching system will make
this one of the most modernly equipped
railway ilnes in the world.
COMMITTEE CALLED
John Q. Burnett and son M. H. Bur
nett have closed a deal with Frank
Russell for 200.000 eighth barrel staves,
which insured the starting of the stave)
mill here within a short time. M. H.
Burnett will be in charge of the work
and grade and receive the staves.
Mart Burnett baa had several years ex
perience handling, grading and making
beer and other staves and there is not
a man in this section who knows better
than he what is needed in a piece of
timber for it to make a good stave.
The rough staves will be received at
any point on the Tennessee Central
railroad from Monterey east. The
price paid will be based on delivery
at the m, 11 in Crossville. Parties wish
ing to ship in car lots will load same
and the freight charges will be deduct
ed from the purchase price after being;
inspected at the mill here.
The staves will be paid for in stave
checks that will be received by any of
the merchants in town or will be cash
ed at the bank on presentation.
There is much timber left in this
county that will make good eigtb bar
rel beer staves as the length is only 18
inches, width four incf.es and one and
one-half inches thick at heart. It will
be seen it does not take a large piece
of timber to make such a stave and
owing to the fact that many persons in
this section have had experience in
making beer staves, they wil be able
to get many such staves now where
they could not have done so without
experience.
Messrs Burnett feel that the y will be
able to gei me auu,uw staves needed
to fill their prevent contract and very
likely many more. At any rate it pre
sents a good opportunity for our peo
ple to utilize to advantage much tim
ber that would otherwise go into rail
road ties ana bring tar less cash to the
timber owner.

DIDN'T SUIT WILSON.
President Wants to Appoint All Members
of Tariff Commission.
Representative Barnhart of Indiana,
went to the White House with an idea.
As he came away be could hear from
the President's room the echoing
words, "The idea!"
Mr. Barnhart's idea was developed
in connection with the discussion of a
tariff commission. The Hnosicr states
man recognizes that a tariff commis
sion can do nothing except o investi
gate and report to somebody. That
somebody, naturally, should be the
Congress, which body alone baa the
authority to make tariff changes; and
it is Mr. Barnhart's idea that the tariff
board should be directly responsible to
I Congress. To make this idea effective
i and to give to the board that "non
partisan" quality which has been de
sired for it, Mr. Barnhart proposed
that each leading party in the Senate
and in the House snould name one
member of the board and that the
President should appoint a fifth.
The President would have none of
this, howevei. He insists that if a
tariff commission is to be set up, he
shall have the naming ot every one of
the men who shall compose it. In
other words, Wilson wants a Wilson
tariff commission. Hi is is in line with
his whole career. At Pinceton he made
it a point, whenever a trustee of the
University was to be chosen, to put
forward a Wilson man for the place;
similarly, when an officer of instruction
down to the lowest tutor was to be
selected, he took pains to get a Wilson
man on the job He never appointed
a committee of the Princeton faculty
that he did not stuff it with a majority
of Wilson supporters. As President of
the United States he has pursued tho
same course. He intends to put nooo
but Wilson men on guard. Congress
man Barnhart would make up the tarift
board with some regard to the spirit
ot the Constitution and to the proprie
ties of the occasion. Wilson would
make it up to suit bis own sweet will.
