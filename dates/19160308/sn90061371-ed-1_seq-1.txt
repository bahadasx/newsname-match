POTOSI. WO.. WEDNESDAY. MARCH 8, 1916.
Abj kind of prosperity la ac
ceptable to the Democrats juat
now. Bvea tb kind "shot from
guna" go-
Most of our faraers save at
the spigot of production expenee
and ioaa oot at the bunghole of
acreage yield.
The farmers can't see any
prosperity in the late drop of 2j
cents in the price of wheat, and
most of them don't own any pro
ducing lead mines.
President Wilson is said to
have a "passion for peace," and
yet be is not so "proud" about
keeping it as he was a year ago.
That second-term bug is biting
him into belligerency.
We are still waiting for Presi
dent Wilson to call uion England
to respect the rights of Ameri
can citizens to the freedom of
the seas. Come, Woodrow, give
us a little exhibit .of some real
"neutrality."
Every month there comes a
yawp from Jeff. City about the
big balances in the state treasu
ry, and in a day or two olotig
cumes the report that slat is so
short of funds that all the items,
of expense, with the exception
salaries, arc being- cut to make
the money hold out.
We notice that whenever the
German airships drop bombs in
England or France andlkill a few
non combattants, our daily pa
pers spread the account of it on
the front page, in black type.
Doth England and France are
constantly making attacks of
this kind on localities in (!er
many, with equally horrible re
suits, which they cheerfully
bonst about; but we only sic-o the'
items well obscured in the hack
pages of our great and impar
tial --God save the luark dailies.
The Republic is trying to put
the St. Louis negro sen relation
law. which wa.i adopted there
one day last wck under the
initiative rule, on the shoulders
of the Republicans, because ttir.V
are in the majority in that city.
Down in the l)emocratic south
they segregate the negroes on
the trees and telephone poles,
without even voting on it, but
the Republic is shy about laying
the responsibilty of such tran
(tactions thereon the shoulders
of its beloved and immaculate
party. '
The American Hople favor na
tional preparedness, but they
are not going to be stampeded
into militarism. There is al
ready a re action against the de
mand from certain interests
that we shall assume a policy
iaconaistent with our attitude
toward the so called militaristic
countries of Europe. We need
enljp an armament for defense:
nything more than that would
b9 obnoxious to our convictions
.,. oar nation stand for the
ideals t P-'cl nJ hsmanity bo

the loss of lives of such citizens
through the sinking of such
ships by attack. Senator Stone
holds that our citrons should
only be allowed to embaik on
armed vessels at their own risk.
The President, on the other
band, holds that the question
involves our national honor,
that It is oar duty, even
to the eitrenity of war. to no
hold the right ef onr citiaens te

W. T. O'Neal of Frankclay was
in I ronton last Wednesday on his
way home from a visit to his
farm in the south end of the
county. William says business
is certainly booming in the lead
belt and the fact is gall and worm -wood
to a few ardent Republicans
thereabout. A few months ago
these same Republicans were in
sisting that there could be no
prosperity with a Democrat in
the White House, but now, in
face of all the evidencp, they are
compelled to admit that times
are good, but it is all "blood
stained." Iron ton Register.
Yes. it is "bloodstained:"
Anyone who will state the facts
concerning the prosperity of onr
mining districts cannot argue
otherwise. The editor of the
Register is too intelligent a man
not to see this, tbooffhhfem'ay let
his partisan instinef.s give it a
strabismic view. We all know
that it is not the healthy tone of
t'ie domestic demand that is
bxisting the, price of lead and
i nc, the market for these metals
was dead until the European war
broke out. Since then, the call
from there for the product of our
mines and smelters has been un
abated. Lot peace come to
morrow to Europe nnd the day
after the action will drcp out of
t'ie lead and zinc market. The
bottom would also drop out of
the prosperity that we have built
u;nn this demand. You hnow it.
Hro. Ake, so why not stale the
trutb'r And what is our lead do
ing over iu Europe? Don't weaU
know that we are sending it over
there to tind a billet in the bodies
of mvn, and whenever such a
billet is found, the lead becomes
blood-stained. The Democratic
party had been in power nearly
a year and a half before the war
broke out, but up to that time
even the most ardent Democratic
partisan had to confess that his
party was punk as a prosperi
ty promoter.
So This Ii Civilization!
They have lulled the peace advo
cates into a bitter silence. Aud
the war goes on. Ho who dares
to lift his head for peace is a
venturesome one; there is ready
for him the slinks and arrows of
ridicule and contempt. Men and
nations while away the hours try
ing to avoid the terrible conflict:
they see no cause for oven a mild
attempt at peace. They specu
late on the length of the brutal
at rugle, but do nothinuj to hasten
the day for whigh man inherent
ly longs. The war howler has
worked his way through obsta
cles and entablements. He has
preached the doctrine of bullets
until "tho man who stands for
peace hesitates before speaking
what he knows is right- Pa
triotism has been commercialized
and natioual honor prostituted.
The man who stands for a ces
sation of hostilities is out of
harmony with the times. Hois
a mollycoddle or a fool. And all
about us the expert at cheap
heroics spreads a delusive color
ing over war to obliterate its
. Whan ties.

The progress of batU U tnau
thrUling by a net moaic;ic
alauKhtcr Is invested with tfugk
by a poetic narrative of bloed.
And a world of abort algbted
oreatorea straggle beneath the
pall and the micfortaaethataU of
them millions more are ready to
follow them beneath the sod.
M illions of eyes have long since
lost their lustre before the tears
that will not stop. Millions of
tots cry out to Heaven for an
anawer to it all. Orphans crowd
the street, half starved men and
women stagger through the bread
line; cripples huddle in darkened
corridors and whisper the awful
tories of this modern triumph.
But peace? No one talks of
peace. That's the death song of
the weakling and the senti
mentalist. Its an archaic thing
that will come if it will and won't
If it won't. Some tells us it will
be tomorrow. Tomorrow and
tomorrow! But with the telling,
all our activities ccav .- We are
afraid to mention peace lest we
be unneutral. liut to preserve
neutrality we preach of war.
And that is the result of 20 cen
turies of civilization. St. Louis
Times.
Solve The Mail Order Problem.
"The only way in which the
merchants in country Uiwns can
hope to conipet with mail order
firms and the largo department
stores of tho cities is through
a co operative study of the prob
lems of merchandising," said J.
B. Powell, instructor in advertis
ing in the University of Missouri,
in a recent speech before the
Business Men's Leauge of Wind
sor, Mo.
Mr. Powell said there was no
reason in the world why a busi
ness genius could not live in a
country town and do business in
a country town as well as in a
large city. He said that the locat
merchant is on the ground floor
and that if he used the right
kind of business methods, carried
dependable merchandise, had the
ritfht idea of service to his com
munity, and adverlibcd in his
local paper persistently, he had
an even better chance to succeed
than the big city store where
competition is keener.
Mr. Powell is secretary of tho
Associated Advertising Clubs of
Missouri, which i affiliated with
tho Associated Advertising Clubs
of the World. 11 frequently
sends literature and offers assist
ance in the organisation of ad
vertising club in cities and towns
of Missouri.

Whatever may be said ef the pcr
pos to discriminate in employment
in faver of the full Cedgfcd American
citizen, whether native or foreign botx,
as against the alien whose failure to
naturalize indicated bis eonunned po
litical allegiance to his native land,
the statement from Leslie's should
open the eyes of honest and thooghtf al
Americans of all and every former na
tionality to the common danger of
arousing, on any account, prejudices
based solely upon the fact of nativity
aad previous citizenship.
If it is proper for an American citi
zen of French birth to hate and oppose
and discriminate against aa Americas
citizen of German or Amman birth ia
business, in polilirs and in society, for
that reason, it is also proper for an
American cltisen cf German or Aus
trian birth to hate and oppose and dis
criminate against Americas citizens of
French. British or Russian biKh. in a
word, if the fact ef birtfl and former
citizenship, even when long foresworn
in favor of American citizenship, tt
going to make us hate and oppose each
other, the rale will work both ways
and he who gives opposition on this ac
count will have to expect it ia return.
Beth Side Would Suffer,
Such a condition of haired and dis
crimisatioa among good Americans,
who cam her from other lands to
get away from unfavorable political,
financial, Indattrial and social condi
tions and to embrace the larger and
better opportunities of America, would
be no less than a national disaster anJ
is utterly unthinkable. Thoaghtfsi
men shadder to consider where it
would lead, but certain it is that not
only one side but both sides ia such
an unnatural warfare would suffer.
Stirring Up Trouble.
In Missouri Just now we have the

a member of the Republican National

four years) aad tub treasurer of the
I'nited States at St. Louis (for four

flooding the state with letters over kls

so largely indebted, this sort of war
