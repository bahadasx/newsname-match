^|The Commercial Club of Warren has
& Nearly Raised its Quota of $8,000,
And Can Be -Depended Upon For
^That Amount^,
jtt is Now Up to the Country Dis
tricts, Whether the College Shall
Live or Go Under. v*
All friends of North Star College
^,%f-'and of education in general are get
S ting anxious now that the time is
drawing near when the money need
ed to secure J. J. Hill's donation
must be on hand. The various com
mittees are hard at work to raise the
^required amount. A committee con
sisting of Julius J. Olson, O. H. Tar
alseth and Aug. A. Johnson, repre
senting the Warren Commercial
Club, has been soliciting funds in the
,city during the past week and has
met with a very cordial reception on
the part of the public spirited citi
zens of the city, who are anxious
to see the school succeed. Subscrip
tions ranging from $50 to $500 have
been received from many business
and professional men. The amount
of $8,000 promised by the city will
be raised without any question.
It is now up to the country dis
tricts to contribute their share to
the great public undertaking. If
they come up to the mark North Star
College will be saved and its future
^assured for all time to come. About
$7,000 are still needed to make up
the $27,000 that must be raised be
fore March 18. If some promises
that have been made tentatively are
redeemed, the amount will be re
duced considerably. A long pull, a
pull and a pull altogether is
w^now what is needed to save the in
stitution. Let no one hold back.
The college is an institution of which
$the whole Red River Valley may
H&Vell be proud. That it has been
p^ooible to establish such" aTschool in
a country where the Indians roamed
Jj^about wild less than 40 years ago is
sV of itself evidence of progress. An

ulG MEN COMING
TO WARREN
Four advance agents of prosperity
will visit Warren next week, March
15 to 18. These are representatives
of the Agricultural Extension Divi
sion of the University of Minnesota,
who are coming to Warren to take
part in the Farmers' Short Course to
be conducted here according to plans
made by the local short course com
mittee. This committee consists of
President, Fred Peterson, secretary,
M. L. Warner treasurer, C. A. Nel
son with L. O. Munger as chairman
of special committee on agriculture,
and Miss Vera Baker as chairman of
The speakers from the Agricultur
al Extension Division of the Univer
sity are genuine boosters. Knowl
edge is power, and they are purvey
ors of knowledge such as is power
ful in promoting prosperity., John
Bower will talk on farm buildings
and live stocky A. B. Lathrop will
discuss farm management. T. M. Mc
Call will talk on farm -gardening.
Miss Bess M. Rowe will treat of
child welfare, home nursing, ..foods
and cookery. *7 '-'fy
It will be seen from this program
that attention is being centered on
certain definite things. The farmers
of Minnesota spend $20,000,000 a
year on farm buildings. Scarcely a
farmer lets a year go by that he
does not build or make some changes.
Every farmer ought to get the bene
fits of the practical discussions which
will be offered here next week.
The Boxville Farmers' Club.1'-',
On Friday evening, *3V March 3rd,
was held another very" interesting
and profitable meeting of the Box
ville Farmers' Club.
The weather being ideal on this
occasion the attendanceMfwas un
usually large. The proposition of co
operating with the Commercial Club
of Warren in the construction of a
gravel road from the Swedish Luth
eran church west to the out skirts of
the city was presented before the
club and as a result a large majority
of the members pledged the services
of themselves and teams free gratis
for one or moreJV(days accomplish
the task.'
The speaker for the evening was
Julius J. Olson, of Warren, who in
a most able and interesting manner
gave a description of his recent trip
to Cuba. We all envy Mr. Olson
the pleasure and knowledge obtained
from his sojourn in the Sunny South,
but on the other hand will all profit
by his impression of the deplorable
conditions existing there to the ex
tent that we shall be content to re
side in the Red River Valley forever.
The next regular meeting will be
The Vega Farmers' Club.
The first regular meeting of the
Vega Farmers' Club was held Feb.
26th, 1916. There was a large at
tendance in spite of the snow storm.
A good program was rendered. A
team was chosen to represent the
club at the stock judging contest of
the Warren Short Course.
The next regular meeting will be
held next Saturday, March 11 at the
Holmgren school house. Everybody
is invited to attend.
Electric Power Shut Off.
The power from the electric light
plant was turned off today for sev
eral hours due to trouble with the
boilers in -the power .house". The
trouble was soon remedied arid the
plant again running in first class
condition. The Sheaf, however, was
not to be hindered by the loss of

management means putting farming
on a purely business basis organiz
ing it so that it will pay an interest
on the investment as well as a re
turn for the labor of management.
This is a study that is bringing pros
perity to scores and hundreds of far
mers, who, before they got hold of
the idea, felt that they were playing
a losing game. Farm gardening is
a subject that too many farmers
have neglected. There is something
worth knowing, and what this some
thing is will be learned next week.
The child welfare, home nursing, and
other home economics lectures will
be of utmost importance. Through
these, the lives, money and_ hitman,
happiness- are being saved.
Lectures will begin in the morn
ings at 10 o'clock, and in the after
noons at 1:30.*" The afternoon work
will close in time to let the farmers
get back to their chores. ,v ,^-r.

SHORT COURSE IS
TO BE PRACTICAL
Subjects of great practical value to
farmers and to farm women will be
presented at the Agricultural Exten
sion Short' Course to be held here
soon under the direction of a staff of
workers from the Minnesota College
of Agriculture, co-operating with the
local Short Course committee, ^fl?"
Sessions for both men and women
will be held, with at least one joint
session. At the latter will be dis
cussed the very important problem of
the farmhouseits arrangement and
equipment. At the separate sessions
for the women will be taken up such
subjects as "Home Care of the Sick,"
"Child Welfare," "Foods and Cooking."
At the men's session will be offered
lectures and demonstrations in rela
tion to the feeding and care of live
stock, drainage, farm management,
farm buildings, and so on.
Short courses such as this bring
the benefits of the College of Agricul
ture to the doors of the people of the
open country. Moreover, they offer
an opportunity for the exchange of
ideas with relation to personal as
,'well as community problems.

gentlemen as follows: F%'^
At the^ Commercial Club meeting.t^flf
Tuesday night, J. S. Hilleboe aud^Hp^
William Miller of Warren, Minnesota**/-?^
were the guests of honor. Theses 1
two gentlemen are farmers living ^fr
near Warren and are officers of a
live stock association formed in that
community. Mr. Hilleboe and Mr,
Miller went to Dr. Ward (State Ve
terinarian) asking that he direct
them to a part of Minnesota where
they had a good veterinarian and?
where they could buy some choice
live stock for breeding purposes for
themselves and for several other
members of their local association
Our state veterinarian directed them
to Dr. Rasmussen of Tyler, assuring
them that he was a very capable and
reliable man in every way and that
he would find for them just what
they desired. T.^
It may be of interest to the read-^
ers to know that these gentlemen
purchased a car load of pure bred
registered holstein, red-polled and
shorthorn cattle in this community.
These cattle were bought at long
prices and the buyers showed ex
ceedingly good judgment in buying."
Among some of the animals bought
were descendants of the famous Far
mer' Farm Herd which has been
bought at a long price by Walter
Hill (son of James J. Hill). It mayt
be safely said that theste prices paide
by Millee and Hilleboe were lower

The cattle purchased, will be distri
buted among1
farmers in the com
munity of Warren which is in the
Red River Valley and will beyond all
doubt create a desire for more stock
of these breeds. Therefore it may
not be the last time that we will see
these estimable gentlemen.
The sale was participated in by
all of our live stock breeders each
furnishing a few head to make out a
car load. It was harder to get the
breeders to sell than the buyers to
buy. They realize that they might
utilize all their breeding animals.
Those selling were K. J. Knud, Chr.
N. Norgaard, Jorsjen Johansen, N. N.

Mr. Miller was then called upon
