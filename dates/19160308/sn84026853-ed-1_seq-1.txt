Morgan, Arthur Wright, Tom Frazier,
Dave Nelson and Dave Little,
charged with breaking into the store
of Mr. Gable, near Antreville, Tom
Frazfer and Dave Nelson were found
"not guilty;" George Morgan plead
guilty, and Arthur Wright was found
guilty of compound larceny. A new
trial was granted Arthur Wright.
The case will be tried at the next

Considerable interest was manifested
in the case of the State vs. :
Lucius Wideman, Hack Watkins, ;
David Davis, Jodie Mattison, Sam j
Mitchell, Jesse Arthur, Will Nicks, 1
Sam Epps, Prue White and Taylor j
Arnold, charged with assault and j
battery with intent to kill. These
t negroes were accused of whipping a i
negro by the name of Corliss Cook,
near Honea Path, S. C., some time \
ago. The testimony shows that j
Cook had made himself objectionable i
to tne orner negroes in tne communi- 1
tjr. After consulting with some of
tneir white friends, Cook was taken ]
Ol't, and given about fifty lashes with h
a buggy whip. The defendant was <

several grounds. The case was ar- 1
gned at considerable length. The
motion was refused except as to one 1
count in which certain formal parts 1
had been left out in drawing the indictment.
The Solicitor was allowed
to amend same by inserting these
, necessary allegations. The Court
being of the opinion that the case ]
would take a considerable length of J
time for its trial, and other cases be- ]
ing more pressing on account of the
fact that the defendants were in '
jail, the case was ordered continued 1
by the court until next term. '
Jake Fair was tried for murder on ,
Thursday afternoon, it being charged "
that he killed a negro near Willington
some time ago. He was represented
by Mes?rs. Graydon & Gray- j

slaughter. He was sentenced to five *
years on the County chaingang or a ,
like term in the penitentiary.
The State failed to make out a
4 case against Calvin Richardson ]
charged with murder, it appearing
that the homicide was accidental and .
the Court ordered a verdict of not
guilty. A pistol being handled by
Richardson discharged, the ball striking
a negro woman and killing her.
This happened in the upper part of
the County, in the Antreville section.

tence of the Municipal Court, where |
he was convicted of transporting li-'
quor. The judgment was reversed, j

NEWTON D. BAKER
WAR SECRETARY
FORMER EXECUTIVE OF OHIO!
CITY ACCEPTS CABINET POSI
TION TENDERED HIM.
Washington, March 6.?Newton D.
Baker, former mayor of Cleveland,
has been selected by President Wilson
for secretary of war.
Mr. Baker has accepted the position
and is arranging his affairs in
Cleveland preparatory to coming to
Washington to take up his duties.
The eselection of Mr. Baker is understood
to have been discussed by
President Wilson with Colonel House
today.
When President Wilson was making
up his cabinet in 1913 he offered
the place of secretary of interior to
Mr. Baker twice. Mr. Baker then
was mayor of Cleveland and declined
for that reason.
The president and Mr. Baker have
been close friends for some time and
have corresponded frequently. Mr.
Baker is said by his friends to be in
close sympathy with the president's
nolicies and is known to have had the
support of some members of the cabinet
for the war office.
When President Wilson recently
was touring the Middle West on his
preparedness program he saw Mr Baker
in Cleveland and had a long talk
with him.
Mr. Baker has been in Washington
frequently of late and on his last visit
here said he had not bee offered the
post of secretary of war and did not
believe he would be.
Ever since Lindley M. Garrison resigned
the president has been seeking
a Middle Western lawyer for the
place.
At the White House today it was
neither officially confirmed nor denied
that Mr Baker would get the
place. Officials strongly encouraged
the use of his name and it was understood
that Mr. Baker had been definitely
selected.
The 30-day period for which Maj.
Gen. Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff,
was designated as secretary of war
id interim, will expire March 11. It
is believed that Mr. Baker's nomination
will be sent to the senate before
that time.
Mr. Baker is 44 years old. He was
born in Martinsburg, W. Va., and at
the age of 25 was appointed private
secretary to Postmaster General Wilion
in President Cleveland's cabinet
[n 1897 he began the practice of law
at Martinsburg. He later moved to
Cleveland, where he became city solicitor
in 1902. He held this office for
10 years until his election as mayor.
In 1914 he was reelected mayor for
a two-year term. i
Mr. Baker has received degrees at
Johns Hopkins and Washington &
Lee Universities.
For years Mr. Baker has been closely
identified with the reform movement
in Cleveland. When Mayor Tom
Johnson died Mr. Baker took up the
fight for lower street car fares and
finally brought about an adjustment
>f street railway franchises in Cleveand.
At the time of the Baltimore contention
Mr. Baker was prominently
mentioned for the vice presidency because
of the fight he made for Mr.
Wilson.
Mr. Baker has been known for
pears as a leader of the Ohio bar and
s highly regarded by the president
is a lawyer. Mr Wilson wanted the
AHa/I K*r o lowtrAi* Kopfliicp nf i
I^IOVC l/jr U mnjvi k/vvmwwv w* .
egal questions constantly arising in
:he administration of the war depart-1
ment, the Philippines, the Panama
:anal and Porto Rico.
Mr. Baker is a member of the Ohio
state Democratic committee and
:hairman of the executive committee
>f his county committee. He has the
record of having Kin for public office
,n Cleveland during 14 consecutive
pears without defeat.
Mr. Baker is understood to have
specified when he joined his law firm
:hat he would be free for six months
arior to the next election to work for
President Wilson's reelection.

A FIGHT FOR LOSS OF DIXIE. tl.
a1
Washington, March 1.?Represen- w
tatives Heflin of Alabama and Clark P1
of Florida, engaged in a heated clash .
on the floor of the house today with ?
Minority Leader Mann and Representative
Stafford, of Wisconsin, over a gi
bill which passed the house, to re- tli
store the right of court of claims to m
consider the reimbursement of south- C
erners for property seized by Union oi
troops during the war between the ti<
states. The claims in question ag- pi
gregate five hundred thousand dol- cc
lars. In reply to Mann's assertion Ti
that "we don't owe one cent to the at
men who endeavored to destroy our di
government," Heflin declared that
"nobody but a coward and a vul- te
garian would use such language fc
here." to
"I don't believe there is another
man on that side of the house at this n<
time who, in light of history, would
make such a charge and slander vt
against my people," he said.
Clark, in answer to Stafford's as- 2<
sertion that "the bill is a entering
wedge to pay claims to those who n<
were disloyal," spoke of the South's ..

we should have trouble now, I rc
apprehend that the defense of the
flag will come more unanimously so
from our section than from that part
where the hyphenated citizens dwells $]
and controls."
He declared the bill was no loot to
of the government, but was arrangement
for court to decide whether the su
debt is just. yl

DEVELOP NE
MINING PROPERTY
Illll III IM IIVI kail I
ITTSBURG CAPITALISTS EXPECTED
HERE IN INTEREST
OF GOLD MINE.
The probability of further developlent
of the Neel gold mine property
i Abbeville county again looms
irge, according to one of the owners
]. S. Marshal C. J. Lyon, of Greenille,
who said today that Pittsburg
apitalists were expected here soon
o confer with him. Mr. Lyon was
ecently in Abbeville in the interest
f the pcroject and -.this week he
rought back with him several speciiens
which geologists say contains
old and pyrites. The mine was oprated
several years ago but lack of
nancial backing caused the owners
3 close. Renewed interest is now j
eing injected by reason of the fact
hat additional discoveries have been
eported made and there is evidence
f a rich, productive vein.
The Neel gold mine property is lo-'
ated on 361 acres of land lying nine,
liles south of Abbeville and about'
ne and one-half miles southeast of
'arsons Mount. it is about six'
riles from the old Dora mine which j
ielded something more than a mil-J
on dollars. The entire section
bout Parson's Mount is heavily minralized,
and the veins seem to have
ocalized in the Neel property says
recent report. There are . five (
leaily marked veins of ore, three of
rhich run entirely across the tract
f land and which have been more
r less developed by shafts to water
;vel. Work has been done on the,
roperty at long intervals, beginning
rith slave mining, before the Civil
'ar. None of the works have been
riven below water level, and no efort
has been made to save more
lan the free gold that could be
aught with an ordinary stamp mill
nd copper plates. Even in this
rude way several thousand dojlars
ave from time to time been tAken |
rom the veins above water, and
et there are many tons of ore
bove water level that have not been
>uched, in the main veins and the
ew veins more recently discovered.
The two main veins on the proper/
are from eighteen inches to two ,
set wide at water level, and have
very indication' of continuing down
) great depth. The values improve i
lth depth?one sample at water
svel showing the very high value of
1.39 per ton.
ine ore is a quartz pymes, partly
ecomposed. The- decomposed py-i
ites contains free gold in exceponally
rich values, while fully
iree-foUrths the value is in the unecomposed
pyrites. A simple process
f treating the ore would be by the
se of the regulation stamp mill
nd copper plates to catch the free i
old, and a concentrating table. Such I
table, if bought new, would cost
bout $300. Fully three-fourths the '
alue of the ore will be found in the ]
)ncentrates, which can be saved b^
n inexpensive process.
It would not be advisable, especilly
in the development stage of the
line, to put in a chlorinating or cya- '
ide plant or a s>nelter, for when j
ich high values can be handled in
ich small concentrated bulk, the
>st of shipping and reduction should |
e nominal. There are several reli- 1
ale plants that treat refractory ore '
i easy reach of Abbevile. One of ;
lese located in this state worked ore j
t profit, the averaged value of
hich was only $1.49 per ton, taking ]
at $58,000 in round numbers dur-l.
g 1907 according to U. S. Geolo- J
ical Survey, 1907.
This was possible because of the ,
reat quantity and accessibility of,
le ore deposit which is a veritable;
ountain. The Candor Mine of North
arolina that has an averaged value
: $8.00 per ton, has a perfect reducon
plant, and the owners would |
obably treat concentrates for other,
>mpanies at a low cost per ton.
his mine is being successfully oper;ed,
and from first to last, has proiced
over $600,000 of bulliorf.
The Neel property has been .exnsively
sampled and assayed. The
illowing are some of the values per
n, found in recent openings: 1

PARIS, HOWEVER, ALSO RECORDS
REPULSE OF ATTACK
FROM CAPTURED POSITION
Further advances by the Germans
in the Verdun region and in Champagne
are told of in the latest French
official communication which, however,
also records successes in repelling
a German attempt to debouch
further from a captured position, the
driving of the Teutons out of a
trench they had'taken and the hammering
with the, French big guns of
German organizations.
After having vigorously. . shelled
the region between Bethincourt and
the Meuse, the Germans in a strong
infantry attack captured the village
of Forges, about nine miles northwest
of Verdun. Not satisfied with
the gain, they several times essayed
to debouch from the village against
the Cote de I'Oie, but the French in
counterattacks forced them back
into the village and held them there.
In the Argonne the French blew up
near Courtes Chaussees a German
post with a mine, and captured a
portion of the crater. Near Hautet
Chavauchee, the Germans sprang
two mines and later entered the
French trenches at several points.
Counterattacks, however, drove them
out and the French also occupied a
portion of the mine crater.
The Germans, while reporting comparative
quiet to the east of the
Meuse, announce the capture of
about a thousand French soldiers in
minor actions Saturday and Sunday.
The Russians, under cover of the
fire of their fleet, at last have been
able to make a landing on the Black
sea coast to the east of Trebizond,
capturing the towns of Atina and
Maprava and driving off the Turks
who opposed thenl. Two officers and
280 men were taken prisoners and
two guns and a quantity of munitions
were captured.
Considerable fighting between the
Russians and the Germans has taken
place in northwest Russia, the Russian
artillery smashing German
trenches in the Riga sector and dispersing
scouting parties in the vicinity
of Friedrichstadt.
Owing to heavy rains and avalanches,
fighting has almost ceased
on the Austro-Italian front.
Berlin reports that in the Zeppelin
raid over England Sunday night the
Hull naval depot was bombed with
effect. All the German aircraft returned
safely.
A British official report says that
Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Rutland,
Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk,
Essex and Kent counties were
visited. Three men, four women and
five children were killed by the bombs
dropped and 33 other persons were
injured.
The house of representatives at

today the armed ship warning resolution
of Representative McLemore.

GOVERNOR AND FRIENDS MAKING
NO COMMENT ON ANNOUNCEMENTS.
~
Columbia, March 5.?Special:
Those close in the confidence of
Governor Manning have not seen fit
to make public any comment on the
various announcements and near announcements
of candidates, both active
and prospective, who will contest
with the Governor for the nomina- \
tion at the hands of the Democrats ^
in the "coming primaries for the position
of Chief Magistrate. That the
friends of the Governor are keeping
in close touch with t?e situation, and
are watching closely every move on '
the political chessboard is known, but
they are not talking for publication.
They are evidently of the opinion
that watchful waiting is the best policy
which can be puraued for the
present, for they are known to feel
that it is still too far away from the
campaign for the different elements
and issues to be clarified. That
there will be much shifting . and
changing in their opinion between
now and the opening of the campaign
While Governor Manning has not'
formally announced his candidacy for
re-election it is known that he will
run. Several uo-State naners this
last week said friends of the Governor
had received letters saying he was
in the race for re-election.
Cooper and Stuck?jr.
The public attention is centred
right at present on what Solicitor R.
A. Cooper, of Laurens, and Mr. W<
A. Stuckey, of Bishopville, Will do.
That both ire being urged to enter
the race for Governor is known
throughout the length and breadth . t
of the State. The attitude of Solicitor
Cooper and Mr. Stuckey will have
a most important bearing on the outcome
of the campaign in the opinion
of well posted and impartial political
observers.
Former Governor Cole L. Blease
has formally announced that he will
seek election to the Governorship,
and his friends are making an active
campaign for him.
There is a widespread and increasing
demand throughout the State fof
the Democratic State Convention to
abolish the county-to-county canvas*
of the candidates. The sentiftient for
the doing away of this archaic me*
thod of campaigning is on the increase
for impartial, and unbiased
observers declare that this political
circus dbes the State a grew! deal of
harm and no good at all. Theywi
clare that without it factionalism
would die and candidates "ivould have
to discuss issues instead of one another,
as it is almost imperative under
the county-to-county canvass to
get any attention. - When the Democratic
clubs meet in April to elect
delegates to thA county conventions
this matter will come up and efforts
will be made to send up instructed
delegations to knock out the countyto-county
canvass, it is sftifl. - ^
Duncan Oat Again. *v
John T. Duncan has again announced
his candidacy for Governor,
Mr. Duncan declares that the people
are tired of the factionalism and are
ready for a new deal.
J. M. DesChamps, of Columbia, has
also announced his candidacy for
governor on uie uemocranc ucneu
He is an author and lecturer and is
making an extensive newspaper advertisingk
campaign of his platform,
on which he will ask the Democrats
of the State to nominate him.
Democrats will cease their differences
this week to see what the Republicans
will do regarding a State
ticket. The Republican State Con- .
vention meets in Columbia on Tuesday
to elect delegates to'the National
Convention in Chicago and to decide
whether or not to put a State
ticket in the field to oppose the Dem
Dcrats. It is not likely that any
State ticket will be nominated by
them.?W. F. Caldwell in News and
Courier.

arhac he thought of the movement in

merchant ships.
"All I've got to say," said the senator,
"is that anybody who butts.. in
jn the president when he's handling ^
foreign relations is a confounded
fool. You can make it as strong as >
jrou like. The president up to date
las handled these matters wisely and
patriotically and he ought not to be
mterferred with."
