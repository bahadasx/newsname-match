LONDON". March 7. The British re-

H::ra!opp case by a court of American

ir.ter.tion to adopt measures of repris-
al. was issued tonight. The British i
reply disclaims any intention to furth-'
cr discuss its charges of inhumanity !
of Germany's sea warfare', which it i
l.clds hs been amply proven.
The Itoralong, a British patrol boat, j
la-t fall was sunk by a German sub- j
sric. Allegations were made that
the Baralong crew afterwards killed
by the submarine crew, while the lat

Former First Lord of the Ad-j

Fisher Should be Returned j
as First Sea Lord. '-
LONDON. March 7. Winston
Spencer Churchill, former First Lord
of the Admiralty, and now a Colonel
fresh from the trenches, sprang back
into the Parliamentary arena in a dar
ing speech answering First Lcrd of
the Admiralty Balfour, who had just
presented 'the naval estimates and de
claring that the Admiralty lacked the
driving force and must be revitalized!
before it was too late by bringing!
back Lord Fisher, former Firt Sea j
Lord and head of the Admiialty ad-j
ministration. . j
Balfour had just finished an optimis j
tic statement on the naval outlook.
Colonel Churchill's statements were!
at first received coldly but he gradu- j
ally gathered attention and applause j
from the Home until
it closed amid :
a scene of enthusiasm. He referred:
to his remarks as "a jarring note and 1
warning." which had to be ghen. He!
was not satisfied concerning the pro-;
gress of naval construction. If the'
program had been carried out it was '
a margin of safety if not danger.
"We must provide not only against
Germany's formerly known program,
hut also her unknown program, which;
she surely has been developing to the
utmost. Submarine menace muts be !
met. . We must guard against unexnocent or an accusation or intimacy
pected dangers. The great remedy for
the Zeppelins is to destroy them in
their sheds. I cannot understand why
the policy of Lord Fisher and -myself
was not carried out in raids on these
sheds at Dusseldorff and Wilhelins
haven." He concluded with an earnest ap
peal against "negative and strategic
policy" of the naval board.
