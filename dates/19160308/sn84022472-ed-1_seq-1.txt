ERAL.EXPLO:
Series of Blasts Last Night Are Followed By Another Ter
1 rific Explosion Today "Which Almost Completely
Destroys Plant Officials Blame Outside Agencies.
Niagara Falls, March 8. Fire fol
lowed an explosion In the chlorate de
partment of the Niagara Electro
chemical Co. shorly "before 9 o'clock
today 'and threatened to complete the
destruction of the plant began last
night, -when several explosions and the
resultant fires inflicted damage esti
mated at $150,000. '
The explosion was heard for several
miles around and across the Niagara
Cataract 'In Canada, when it caused a
hasty mobilization of the -militia
guarding the frontier. The police roped
off the streets in the vicinity of the
chemical plant as the fire was driven
toward chemicals of aiigh explosive
nature. ' '.
The firemen were helpless to cope
with the spreading fire because water
mixing with the chemicals only added
fuel to the flames.
Xr. Hector R. Carvath, manager of
the company, issued a formal state

1 I don't remember," was the key
fiote of Jason S-' Haines' defense when
he took the stand in the criminal, su
perior court this- morning to jtell his
version of them urder of his wife. .
. "1 don't remember" shooting my
Wife," he declared. -; "I didn't intend
to shoot her and leave my four boys
motherless without a" relative in the
world ;
Haines was calm In manner during
his recital. He spoke in a low tone
and sometimes his voice was so inaud
ible that his counsel. Attorney Jacob
B. Klein, had to request him to speak
louder. Haines claimed he couldn't
remember much of anything that hap
pened from the Saturday ? preceding
the murder until the day of his arrest.
He had' been drinking steadily at this
time. - '
He recalled coming'to this city from
Trumbull but didn't" remember re
member returning to his home 'and
slaying his wife. His next clear recol
lection was waking up in Jail "and
hearing- about the murder. In de
scribing his capture in Newtown he
said "he went to Newtown with two
detectives who were making animals."
When asked what he meant by that
statement Haines finally changed it by
Baying he thought he saw animals. .
Haines testified that he is 48 years
old. He; was married 19 years ago
to Annie Boblick, who worked" at
Minor Smith's Stratford resort at the
time. Their married life was gener
ally pleasant, he said, although they
had some disputes when they had
been drinking. One time he told his
wife that if she would stop drinking,
he would. , He declared that when
hia wife had been drinking she often
struck him. Once she hit him with
3, frying pan and ' at another time
threw stones at him until ' he hit her
with a pail. . -
Upon cross-examination by State's
Attorney Cummings, . Haines admitted
he had four guns about the house, but
didn't think more than one was load
ed, i In regard to his drinking habits
fee said,' "I guess I drank more than
my wife." He denied Mrs. Haines had
asked him to stop drinking.
He didn't know, he declared, that his
Wife complained to one of the neigh
bors, Mrs. Waller, about being beaten
by him. He said tl vt on the occasion
when he struck his wife on the head
with the pail that the pail had slippe
out of his hand. Haines claimed he
didn't remember saying to his son,
"Some day you'll come hn and find
your mother dead."
The . cross-examination was resumed

had been "bombed."
"I am,''1 he said, "convinced the ex
plosion in our plant was the result of
outside agencies. : Careful investiga
tion has shown us the first explosion
was not such as would' have occurred
had chemicals storejl in our buildings
let go. i
"I believe a bomb with only a small
amount of explosive was set off just in
side the peroxidal plant, the slight ex
plosion that followed giving most of
the employe a chance to escape. The
second explosion was also caused by a
bomb but those that followed were
those of the stores of chemicals in the
plant." '
Dr. Carvath has asked the police to
make every effort to find the dyna
miters.He was making an inspection of
the plant when today's explosion oc
curred. No one was injured. In the
incidental explosion last night one
man was killled and another badly in
jured, i s . - .

Germans Report Further
Gain With Capture of
Many Prisoners Paris
Hopeful of Result.
Paris, March 8 -France awaits
anxiously but confidently, the issue of
today's battle. Yesterday's attacks
left the situation undecided. Cor
beaux "Wood, in which the Germans
succeeded in establishing themselves,
is within a hollow "between Deadman
and Goose Hills and as neither posi
tion is endangered the German suc
cess is of little import.
It is known here that the Germans
set aside .300,000 men to capture Ver
dun..' Only 200,000 having been em
ployed up to yesterday, it was a ques
tion whether the remaining 100,000
would be used to make a sudden de
scent on part of the French line de
veloping the offensive agalnst'tSe
fortress.
The heavy attack west of the river
however, leaves that question no
longer to be settled. " The impression
of members of parliament who keep
regularly informed as to the pro
gress of the battle, is .that the de
fense will be "able ito resist, all on
slaughts the Germans may make and
that Goose Hill, on the left bank, will
play a role similar to that of Douau
mont on the right. It Is . expected
the battle will reach its climax to
morrow or Friday. Not until then
will it be possible to: judge which way
the battle will go. f (

Frank Takas Loses Children
Through Frequent Ap- .
proaches to Bar;
Because the father drinks and will
not support his family, five children
of Frank Takas and Mary Dobumas
were today committed to St. Francis'
home by Judge Miller in the probate
court. Although no marriage cere
mony was ever solemnized for them,
the couple has been living together in
Bridgeport for 19 years. The family
has had nothing to eat for the last .24
hours and Mrs. Mabel L. Godman, the
family visitor of the charities depart
ment, had to borrow clothing to cover
them in order to bring them into
court. They had. been living at 427
Osborne street. One boy. Andrew,
aged six, possessed only a suit of dark
colored underclothing. It was neces
sary for Mrs. Godman to borrow coat,
trousers, cap, shoes and stockings for
him. The others committed are:
Helen, aged 15; Mary, 13; Frank, 12,
and Michael, 5. There are two other
chillren, Steve, aged 17, who works
in the American Graphophone Co. fac
tory, and Katie, two years old.
The .father of the children object
ed to their commitment but Mrs. God
man told Judge Miller that the fam
ily had received aid from the chari
ties department until lit was discovered
the husband was not working and was
getting intoxicated on part of , the
earnings of his son and his wife.
When Mrs. Godman went to get the
children today one hid under a bed
and another in a closet. The oldest
girl, Helen, although 15 years of age,
has advanced only as far as the
fourth grade in Longfellow school.
The other children do riot attend a
school regularly.
Rev. Stephen Chernltzky, pastor of
St. Stephen's R. C. church, told
Judge Miller that the family had not
attended church in 15 years, and that
Takas is worthless, lazy and a drunk
ard. After the hearing Judge Miller call
ed up Prosecuting. Attorney DeLaney
and requested him to issue a warrant
for the arrest of Takas on the ground
of non-support. .Takas had told Judge
Miller that he had a wife living in
Hungary when he came to America.
He was never divorced he said, and
no wedding ceremony was ever per
formed between himself and the wom
an who bore him his children in this
country. The children raised such
strenuous objection to being separated
from their mother that Judge Miller
called on City Sheriff Brown to accom
pany Mrs. Godman to New Haven.
Steve Takas seemed satisfied to have
his father arrested and committed to
JaiL --
"The old man won't work and he
spends all the money he can get his
hands on for booze," he said. He
asked that the little girl, Katie, aged
two, and the boy, Mike, aged five, be
allowed to remain with the mother.
He promised that with the' aid of his
mother he would support them. Mike,
however, was committed to the home
with the other children.

Memorandum on Submarine Issue Contends That
Measure Was Adapted in Reprisal Willing to
Conform to Law of Seas Existing Before War,
If England Concedes Same, Says Message
Ambassador and Secretary Lansing Both Sil
ent on Documents Which Are Laid Before
President Wilson For Consideration.
Washington, March 8 Count Von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador, today at the instruction of his gov
ernment1, handed to Secretary Lansing a long memoran
dum explaining in detail the German position in regard
to the armed merchant ships and the causes leading up to i
the decision of the central European powers to torpedo
without warning all armed merchantmen of their enemies.
Both Officials Are Silent.
Secretary Lansing and Count Von Bernstorff de
clined to divulge its contents.
It is understood to contain the allegation that Great
Britain had taken advantage of the contention of ,the
United States that Americans must be safe on defensively
armed merchantmen to have those ships act offensively to
ward enemy submersibles.
The German government, it is understood, concedes
that as submarines are a new engine of warfare, inter
national law as at present constituted, makes no provision
for their use.
The German government is understood to express a
willingness to operate its submarines in accordance with
international law prevailing prior to the war, provided
Great Britain does net violate the same laws. t .
, It a.Xap is . understood that the
memorandum contends the evidence
appended to the late German an
nouncement proved that British sships
armed ostensibly for defense have
been instructed to act, and have acted,
offensively, and that they are not
peaceful traders as the United States
was assured they would be by Sir
Cecil Spring-Rice, the British ambas
sador. The memorandum is also under"
stood to reiterate the previous declara
tions that submarine warfare was be
gun by Germany in reprisal for the an
nounced intention of Great Britain
to starve the civilian population of the
central empires. .
The memorandum also is under
stood to refer to the long standing
friendship between the United States
and Germany and to express the hope
that the American people will, when
familiar with the explanations offered
fully appreciate the position in which

MRS. TRUMBULL
WILL HAVE PRO
RATA INDEMNITY
Counsel For Lusitania's Vic
tim's Estate Awaits State
. Department.
Mrs. Isaac B. Trumbull, whose hus
band was killed almost a year ago
when the Cunard liner Lusitania was
torpedoed off the coast of Ireland,
will receive a pro rata share of the
lump sum to be paid as an indemnity
by Germany for American lives lost
in the disaster.
The claim of Mrs. Trumbull was
filed with the State Department sev
eral months ago by Judge E. K. Nich
olson. With the question of the
amount of indemnity practically the
only thing standing in the way of a
final settlement of the case, Mrs.
Trumbull's claim should be paid
shortly.
According to Judge Nicholson, the
procedure in the awarding of indem
nity in such cases is as follows: The
disputant governments fix upon a
lump sum to be paid as an indemnity.
This money is transmitted to the
proper department of the aggrieved
givernment in this case, the State
Department of the United States
and it is then apportioned pro rata
among the claimants. The division is
made on a strictly pro rata basis,
every claimant receiving a like share.
There are more than 100 claims, in
behalf of deceased Americans, before
the State department.

Germany finds herself as a result of
the blockade.
By way 'of supporting the conten
tion that Germany's reprisals are jus
tified, the memorandum is said to
enumerate various actions of Great
Britain which have operated against
the interests of neutrals and their citi
zens. These are cited to show that
Great Britain has violated interna
tional law.
To sustain the Gorman contentions
it is pointed out that Germany agreed
to abide by certain terms of the
Declaration of London but that inas
much as Great Britain has not re
strained her actions to conform with
the terms of that declaration, Ger
many conM -' exacted to agree
o operate under a code which Great
3ritain disregards.
It is probable that the complete
text of the memorandum will be given
out for publication soon. It un
doubtedly will be laid before President
Wilson some time today. '

Wallace of New York, members of
the crew of Bartlett's Reef Lightshi;
were picked up - this morning by
Quartermaster's ' steamer General
Pickering in a small sailboat which
was drifting helplessly in the raging
waters of Plum Gut
The rescue effected by Captain Chas.
N. Eglise, of the' transport and hia
men was of the most thrilling char
acter. Alfred Greenwood, one of
the crew, being nearly. drowned in an
attempt . to rescue the men. . ,
The Pickering was returning from
Fort Terry to :New London and on
passing Bartlett's Reef a signal of
distress was noted on the lightship.
The Pickering ran as. close as possible
and was informed that two members
of the crew were - adrift somewhere
in the vicinity. After a long search
Captain Eglise found the boat tossing
about close to the Gut.
The "steamer ran up to the sailboat
and discovered the bodies of the two
men stretched out in the water which
was rapidly filling her. It was impos
sible to get close to the sinking craft.
The only method available was for
seamen of the Pickering to get into
theb oat which, in view of the condi
tions was a difficult operation. In en
deavoring to do tnis Greenwood mis
calculated the distance and leaped
into the Sound. He was rescued with
difficulty.
Eventually two of the crew of the
Pickering got into the sailboat with
lines and the men were hauled on
board the transport.
First aid treatment was given and
then the men were brought to New
London.
