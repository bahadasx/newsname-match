VOL. XXVIII. MANNING, S. C., WEDNESDAY, MARCH 8, 1916.
SENATE IS FIRM IN
WILSON'S SUPPORT
BY VOTE OF 68 TO 14 GORE RESO
LUTION IS EFFECTUALLY
KILLED.
A WARM DEBATE FOLLOWS
Free Expression of Opinion of Sena
tors Which at Times Was Shout
ed and Out of Order.
Washington.-By a vote of 6S to 14
the senate carried out President Wil
scn's wish and killed Senator Gore's
resolution to warn Americans off arm
ed belligerent ships.
In a turbulent scene, such as is
seldom witnessed in the senate, the
veting proceeded with senators shout
ing objections, futilely demanding
recognition to explain their positions
and making hot retorts to each other.
all of which were out of order. At
one time so many senators were
shouting for the Vice President's rec
ognition that the Sergeant-at-Arms
x as called to restore quiet.
- After having maneuvered for two
days to get the resolution in such
parliamentary position that it - was
disposed of without debate the Sen
ate then proceeded to a general dis
cussion of the subject which continued
all afternoon to the dismay of admin
istration supporters. There were
free expressions of opinion that the
senate's action, because the vote ac
tually was taken on a motion to table
the Gore resolution with a correction
by the author and a substitute by Sen
ator McCumber, was in effect a
"Scotch verdict" and had not actually
accomplished the purpose of the Pres
ident. Such statements aroused the
President's friends, who feared they
'would produce an effect directly op
posite to that intended-a notice to
the world that the senate stands be
hind the President in his demand on
Germany for the rights of Americans
traveling the seas.
In the house, however, the foreign
affairs committee by a vote of 17 to
2 took a longer step toward meeting
fully the President's wishes. It voted
to report the McElmore warning res
olution with the recommendation that
it be tabled.
At the White House satisfaction
was expressed with the senate's ac-.
tiz'n.
Senator Gore voted for the motion
to table and declared he considered
the administration victory a mixed
one.
BATTLE CONTINUES TO RAGE.
More Than 3,000 Men Perished When
French Cruiser Was Sunk.
London.-In the sinking in the mid
Mediterranean recently of the French
auxilary cruiser Providence II, the in
dications are that there occurred the
greatest marine disaster in the world's
history, so far as loss of life in con
cerned. --
The French Admiralty reports that
there were nearly 4,000 persons on
~board, and up to date it has only ac
counted for 870 of them. Seemingly,
therefore, more than 3,000 men perish
ed, when the former trans-Atlantic
liner went to the bottom. The staff
of the Thii-d Colonial Infantry Regi
ment was among the many soldiers
aboard the cruiser. The story of how
the vessel was sunk remains to be
told.
Around the village of Douaumont
which Is in the hands of the Germans
Is raging a battle of great intensity.
Having captured the village and ex
tended their lines west and south, the
Germans were forced to give ground
before vicious attacks of the French
who regained part of the terrain they
had lost. The fighting here Is pro
ceeding unabated.
injunction Against Conductors.
Atlanta, Ga.-Suit to enjoin officers
and members of the Order of Railway
Conductors from "carrying out a con
spiracy of threatened strikes" as pro
test against the installation by rail
-roads of the White audit system was
'fled In United States District Court
here by counsel for audit company.
Deny Right of Federal Court
Norfolk, Va.-The German Empire
through Lieut. Hans Berg, command
ing the former British liner Appam,
and L. M. von Scholling, vice consul
for the district comprising Norfolk,
Newport News and Portsmouth, de
nied the jurisdiction of the Federal
Court in deciding the status of the
ship, in answering libel proceedings
instituted by the African Steam Navi
gation Company, Ltd., of Liverpool,
for recovery of the vessel. The an
swer was fled but no date set for
hearing.
Mayors Organize.
New Orleans.-A permanent organ
ization of American mayors to pro
mote the cause of National defense
was effected here at a meeting of
mayors and their representatives from
80 large cities.
The organization is to be known as
the National Defense Conference of
M-trors. Mayor Kiel of St. Louis who
presided. appointed a committee on
resolutions of 11 men. The principal
speaker<- at the sessions were Mayor
Mitchel of New York and Cornelius
Vanderbilt of New York.

2; LITARY BILL
NOI IN CONGRESS
MORE SWEEPING CHANGES IN
POLICY THAN PROPOSED BY
PRESIDENT.
FOUR STRIKING FEATURES
Federal Volunteer Force; Enlisted Re.
serve; Federalization of National
Guard and an Officers' Reserve.
Washington.-The first of the na
tional preparedness measures to reach
either house of Congress for consider
ation was introduced in the senate by
Senator Chamberlain. chairman of the
military committee, which perfected it
after weeks of hearings and confer-'
ences. It proposes an even more
sweeping change in military policy
than that outlined by President Wilson
in his annual message, and was de
scribed by Mr. Chamberlain as the
most comprehensive piece of military
legislation ever offered in Congress.
There is no vital difference between
the Senate and House measures and
both committee believe that when the
final bill, which will be agreed upon
in jointc onference committee, has
passed both houses, the president will
be able to affix his signature to a
measure that will do more than he has
asked toward, building up an adequate
national defense.
Aside from its plan virtually to
double the regular army and national
guard, the senate bill has four strik
ing features. They are:
Authorization ofa purely Federal
volunteer force in peace times, the
object sought by Secretary Garrison.
in urging the continental army plant.
Authorization for a definitely enlist
ed reserve in peace times among men
of every profession or calling whose
training fits them for special duty
either with troops, on lines of com
munication or supply, or in machine
shops and munitions plants.
Federalization of the National
Guard under a pay provision designed
to bring this force immediately into
such relations with the federal govern
mnet that its training, equipment and
personnel will be under supervision
of the war department.
Authorization for an officers' reserve
and a reserve officers' training corps,
which would take in graduates from
military schools and colleges and pro
vide for ther further development to
command.
MOEWE REACHES HOME PORT.
German Raider Reports Sank Fifteen 1
Vessels.
Berlin, via London.-An official

Colonel House Returns.
New York.-Col. E. M. House, who

a confidential mission for President
Wilson, arrived here on the steam
ship Rotterdam from Falmouth. As
soon as he landed from a special coast
guard cutter, which met the Rotter
dam at Quarantine. Col. House an
nounced he would leave at once for
Washington to meet the president. He

abroad. He stated that he was treated
with courtesy everywhere.
Ask Austria to Apologize.
Washington.-The United States is
preparing to make formal demands
upon Austria-Hungary as a result of
the attack by an Austrian submarine
upon the American tank steamer Pe
trolite. A note on the subject will
be dispatched within the next few
days. It was authoritatively stated 1

Columbia.
Sov. Manning approved the act of
the general assembly outlawing the ]
Southearstern Underwriters' associa- ]
[ion from South Carolina. The gover
nor also approved the insurance
brokers' act, which requires an annu
al license of $25.
No steps have been taken by South
Carolina authorities to combat action
which may come from the announce
ment of 67 of fire insurance companies
that they would withdraw from the
South Carolina field as a result of
Governor Manning's approval of the
so-called "brokerage" and anti-com
pact insurance bills.
The 67 insurance companies organ
zed outside the state are members
>f the Southerastern Underwriters'
Association, and will be controlled, it
was said, by action of their organiza
ion. The association has closed its
oval offices and withdrawn jurisdic
ion over the South Carolina business
)? its members. Big companies, it
was said here by their agents, will
,ancel all policies on South Carolina
"isks. There are about 95 fire insur
nce companies doing business in this
state and it was indicated that those
yutide the Underwriters' Association
night also withdraw.
The "anti-ccmpact" law, effective
March 22. prohibits the organization
)f fire insurance companies to main
:ain uniform charges of rates in the t
;tate. It was to this law that cheif
bjection from the companies was
nade at a hearing before the Gover
nor signed the bill. '
The "brokerage" law which became
ffective immediately that it was sign
d. imposes an annual license fee of c
$25 upon agents of each company they
-epresent, and taxes agents- four per l
yent on all premiums paid into them.
James A. Cathcart. president of the
outh Carolina Association of Fire 1
LTrderwriters, a state organization, C
said not to be connected with the c
outheastern Underwriters' Associa- E
ion, stated that their agents were
'somewhat in the , ark" as to the S
ourse their companies would follow.
athcart added that it was his own 1
)pinion that withdrawal of a large
iumber of companies would work a
ardship upon small insurers, as he t
elieved the big companies of his as
sociation would handle only larger
ines in South Carolina. and do this '9
usiness through brokers.t
Governor Manning after signing the
Lti-compact bill issued a statement
n which he said:
"The general assembly," said the
~overnor, "enacted what- is known as
he Laney-Odom bill, prohibitir.g the
ormation of organizations or com
acts of fire insurance companies to
i. and control rates. This comes to
ne for my approval or disapproval.
fter a full hearing, at which writ
en and oral arguments were present
d for and against the bill, I am con
'inced that it is ray duty to approve ~
nd sign it.
"The arguments against the bill do e
ot, in my opinion, furnish adequate
easons for my withholding my signa- c
ue. There is evidently something p
grong in reference to thc fire insur- g
nce rates charged in this state. This d
>ll is an effort to give competition in 1
stes. I believe I am acting in the it
nterest of the people of South Caro
ia in approving this act." fi
danning Upholds wilson's Policy.
Interpreting the public sentiment in
his state in regard to Prce;ident Wil-1
ec's letter to Congressman Pou in
:e present crisis in Washington, '
iov. Manning sent the following tel-r
~gram to the United Press in reply to
heir qucry:
"Your telegram. South Carolina t
enimnent is practically unanimous in
iupport of President Wilson's posi- ~
icr. Our people are behind him. We
eand that congress shra give the
rsident a vote of confidence and
ave it to hL.m to deal with foreign ~
ufairs. We are confident that con-t
~ress will see its duty as loyal Amieri- c
ans and will uphold the president in
rotecting the interests and honor of
America."
Red Cross Seal Sales Was Larger.
The final report of the Red Cross
meal commission of South Carolina on t:
:he year's camp~aign for selling the. s
Christmas seals in the fight against C
iubarculosis has been made p~ublic. e
lho results, though not as large as
was hoped for. are a gratifying im
;rovemnt over last year's sales. Al- p
ogether 289,000 sales were sold in
o~uth Carolina during December. Of
:he $2.390 thus re'alized only 10 pe-r t
nt; S>9. goes to the American fled
Cross. The remainder is used in the

Charles R. Weeks, retiring presi
dent of the federation, was absent but
sent his address,' which was read at
the meeting by William R. Timmons
of Rock Hill, secretary of the Ybrk
county fair. He-said in part:
"I do not - believe- that circuits ar
ranged on geographic location will he
successful for three reasons: Each
fair spends a different amount.. of
money for free attractions; different
towns in a geographically arranged
circuit are apt to give very different
support to the fair and to the shows;
and amusement companies rate the
fairs differently.
"As you all know, I am for an edu
cational fair, but I am now ready to
confess that we must be careful no
to depend on educational, features. at
the expense - of loss in paid admis
sions, which after all is the life blood
of a fair. Hera is the principle we
must recognize.. Our race came up
from savagery through barbarism,
chivalry, to civilization. No doubt our
race spent more time in the barbaric
stage than we have in the civilized.
The European war shows how easy
it is to drop back. Science tells us
that every individual repeats the race
history. The barbarian likes excite
ment, show, glamor, noise, rings in
his nose and bracelets on his ankles.
If we get the people to the fair, that
we may educate them after they 'get
there, we must appeal to them through
amusements that satisfy their racial
inheritance, of which we -all have~ out
share. Of course it is the duty of the
fair officers to see that the amuse
ments meets these requirements and
is clean and elevating. This certainly
is a problem for your discussion.". I

Leaps From High Bridge.
Spartanburg.-Samuel Linder, 60
years of age, and a resident of the
Enoree section of the country, being
caught on the C. & W. C. trestle over
the Enoree river jumped from the
structure, more than 45 feet above the
st eam, and escaped with no greater
injury than a dislocated, thigh. He
was near the center of the long
bridge when the train came upon him
and realizing it was certain death to
stay on the trestle he took the only
hance and jumped. His body is said
to have turned over twice in the de
scent, but he landed feet foremost and
was almost buried in mud bottom of
tie stream. 'Friends rari to h~s assist
ance and, he was brought to the bank.
Laurens Must Renew Charter.
Laurens.-The city o.f Laurens as a
licipality, it hias been discovered.
Is without a charter- Anl investigation
f the matter reveals the fact that the
harter granted by special act of the
legislature December 23, 1890, incor
porating the city of Laurens for a per.
iod of 25 years. has expired, and so
ax no general act has been found in
tb.e statutes that would automatically
cntinue and keep in force the chlarter

citizens must petition the secretary
for a new charter.

URGE CLEANLINESS IN DAIRY T
Mechanical Milker Admits No Dust or a

fix
Much is said of the cleaniiness of of
milk. Most people like to use a pail in $I
milking that has as. small an opening tic
as it is convenient to milk into. The "C
mechanical milker has no opening ha
that can admit dust or dirt into the 03
milk except where the milk is taken CC
into the tubes. These can be packed W1
with clean cotton if necessary, thus as
preventing the entrance' of dirt or CO
dust. az
But the milk taken into the ma- te
chines may be contaminated by the
dirt left in the machine from the

When proper care is taken, extreme

)AIRYING ON BUSINESS BASIS air
six
armers Must Use Milk Scales, Tester str
and Record Book-Keep Account
With Each Cow. a1
In order to put dairying upon a busi -_m
ness basis every farmer needs to use ab:
he milk scales, the tester and the rec- to
ord book. Farmers must come to this fo
proposition and do a little simple book- mc
keeping to know where they are. 6
Every successful business man has a a
edger to guide him in his transac- cre
tions. fia'
Every dairyman needs to enter aca
separate account wit'h each of his cows. sij
so that he may have an indicator to evs
tell him at the end of the year just am
how much feed each has consumed,
he amount of milk produced and the.,
percentage it tests. .,
Too many farmers of this country mc
are still keeping scrub cows, feeding the
and milking them twice each day, y
urteen times each week and sixty me
imes each month. Isib

EMOVING ODORS FROM MILK
dral Investigators Have Discov
ered Method to Remove Unples
ant Smells and Tastes.
L method bas been discovered by
Sfederal investigators for removing
agreeable odors and flavors from
Lk. The taste caused by cows eat
wild onions or garlic can be re
ved by blowing filtered and washed
through the milk for thirty to
ty minutes, according to the
ength of the flavor to be removed.
t is necessary to heat the milk to
;emperature of 145 degrees, as air
wn through cold milk in's sar
ner does not remove the disagree
e flavor. It also has a tendency
turn the fat Into butter. It was
ud that the onion flavor is removed
re quickly when milk is heated-to
degrees, but this tends to 3poduce
ooked taste and also reduces -te
am line. In the case of cream with
rors of this kind, the same method
tbe used, except that It requires a
htly longer treatment. The-loss tin
