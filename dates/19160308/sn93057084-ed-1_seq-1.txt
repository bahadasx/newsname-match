WHO HAS A BETTER WAY
to Vote
Most of the time it is not very
hard to find plenty of ^voters who
sajT they do not like the "spoils"
system in American politics, and
they .will agree with you, that it
ought to be eliminated. But, as
it appears to The Press, it has re
maifaed for Hon. R. O. Richards
to propose a method for doing the
eliminating. If anyone has a bet
ter plan The Press [has not heard
of it.
ANOTHER NEW PRIMARY
LAW
Mr. Richards sends us a copy of
his amended law, which he will
submit to the voters again at the
coming general election, and in a
circular letter accompauving it
insists on the need of it iu the fol
lowing language, which we think
is logical and to the point:
Prepare for PEACE, instead
of War
"Our election laws constitute our
public organization laws. Our im
perfect election laws do not harvest
upon public sentiment, in a practi
cal way, to promote "On earth
peace, good will to men" as the
public mind develops.
"The reason for this is the use of
the official spoils system in organi
zation, and that there is no evolv
ing or separating process on issues
or leadership, no public joint de
bates on issues, no clean cut line
up on the party ballot in the initia
tory proposals under our present
primary election system. It is
therefore impossible for the elec
tor to intelligently cast his ballot
to separate the wheat from the
chaff on men and measures. Hence
election results miscarry every
time, and the people do not get
what they expect. The goyern
ment remains half right and half
wrong all the time, even with the
best-intentioned men as execu
tives. We cannot have a new gar
ment and retain the old patch.
Better organization methods are
therefore of the utmost import
ance. The present anarchy in the
international police power in
Europe is a sad evidence of the
lack of organization for public
welfare.
Society has always tried to
Vmild from the top down in polit
ical organization instead of from
the bottom up.
The political party is the
organization unit of our na
tional and state government.
The government is therefore
a government by organiza
tion thru political parties and
by majorities. It is manifest,
therefore, that the solution of
state government lies thru OR
GANIZATION FOR PUBLIC
WFLFARE rather than thru
meddlesome regulation and end
less litigation or destructive forcc.
Before the specific proposals will
be proposed in solution of state
government, organization
method must first lie set in order.
There fire at present eight, candi

Bartina Dale was born in Min
nesota April 21 1877, came with
her parents to Potter county So.
Dakota in the spring of 1884 where
she grew to womanhood and was
married to Henry Hawkinson No
vember 28 1805. To this union
were, born five children: three
boys and two girls. She and her
husband went to housekeeping
soon after their marriage upon
their farm in Cattron-twp. Potter
co, where they have lived ever
since.
She died at the hospital in Ro
chestcr-Mion, where she had go-ne
for treatment, on Monday March
6th. Owing to the poor train ser
vice between there and Gettys
burg, the funeral was not held un
til 1 p.m. Thursday March 9th in
the Gettysburg M. E. church after
which the remains were laid to
rest in the Gettysburg cemetery.
She leaves a husband, a mother,
tive children, six sisters and two
brothers, besides a host of friends,
to mourn the loss of a true wife, a
loving daughter, a fond mother,
and a loyal friend.

DANGERS OF DRAFT
Drafts feel best when we are
hot, and perspiring, just when they are
most dangerous, and the result is neural
gia. stiff neck, sore muschs or sometimes
an attack of rheumatism. In such cases
apply Sloan's Liniment. It stimulates
circulation to the sore and painful part.
The blood flows freely and In a short time
the stiffness and pain leaves. Those suff
ering from neuralgia or neuralgic head
ache will tind one or two applications of
Sloans Liniment will give great relief.
The agonizing pain gives way to a tingling
sensation of comfort and warmth and qui
et rest and sleep is possible. Good for
neuritis too. Price 25c at your drugist.
