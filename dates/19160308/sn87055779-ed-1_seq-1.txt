In the Verdun region, the com

in the situation during the night.
The Germans continued their bom

The text of the communique fol

"A counter attack launched by the

faucon on which automobile trans
port. were reported.
"In the region t the north of
Verdun no change was reported dur
ing the night. The (Irrmaiis have
continued, their bombardment of our
front, to the west of the Meuse with
out attempting any infantry attac ks.
Our batteries have responded ener
getically to the enemy's tiro in that
sector, as well as to the east of the
Meupe, where the bombardment has
been Intermittent.
"In the Woevre region there was
very violent artillery duel. We
bombarded HIanzee. Grimaueourt
and the outskirts of Frcsncs. An
attack by the enemy upon our rail
ways and the Manhuelles road was

Despite German gains at Forge.
and Fresncs, military experts are
onfldent that the kaiser's grand
scheme to encircle Verdun and cap
ture (Jen. J off re's army is loouie
to failure.
The German? are methodically
trying to pound, their way to utory
with ma.s.ses of heavy guns, but as
they advance they find the French
positions st.-onger and stronger, and
fresh artillery has been going to the,
front for a week to reinforce the
French batteries.
The fact that Yerd-m is nearly
two-thirds purrour.deu by (lermau
troops H now regarded a significant
in military circles, for it is believed
that the Teutons h.iva advanced
about us far its they will be aide t

being raked by our cross fire.
"It is evident that the German ad
vance jesterday is only a prelude to
an immense offensive which is
pending."
The Germans have an unknown
number of reserves in addition to
the half million men n the cr .wn
prince's army, says the Matin. .The
military critic of the Matin says it
is better that the battle at Verdun
should be fought to a decisive con
clusion, because the German losses
will prevent the kaiser from at
tempting an offensive movement
else w here.
The war expert of the Kcho do
Paris says that the battle may now
be expected to extend beyond the
narrow sector of yesterday which
was between I'.ethincourt and the
Meuse river.
Continuing, he says:
'The unprecedented, murderous
activity of the enemy's artillery,
which is unceasingly hurling shells
of all calibers into our advanced
lines, shows the great strength of
his accumulated war stores. In
spite of this storm of steel our men
have been able to hold nearly all
their positions. It is true that tho
taking of Forbeaux wood puts joose
hill in danger, but even if it falls we
have stronger positions to the rear
to fall back upon. The battle of
Verdun ought to reach its culmin
ating point on Friday or Saturday."

is said to he at Verdun help

and they will be specifically pledged j
to use such armament only in de

before the United States a detailed
explanation of the reasons which
constrained her to order armed
merchantmen sunk without warning;.
Here's Text of Memorandum.
Following is the text of the memo
randum handed Sec.'y Lansing by
Count von Hernstorff:
"Tho imperial German govern
ment, on account of the friendly re
lations which have always existed
between the two great nations, and
earnestly desiring to continue them,
wishes to exph.in the U boat ques
tion once more to the American gov
ernment. "At tho outbreak of the war the
German government, acting upon j
the suggestion of the United States, j
immediately expressed its readiness
to ratify the declaration of Indon. .
At that time a German prize code,
had already been issued, which was
entirely and without modification
based upon the rules of the dec
laration of London. Germany there
by proved her willingness to recog
nize fully the existing rules of in
ternational law which insure the
freedom of the sea for the legitimate
trade of neutral nations, not only
among themselves, but also with
belligerent countries.
' Great Hritain. on the other hand,
declined to ratify the declaration of
London, and after the outbreak of
the war began to restrict the legiti
mate trade of the neutrals in order
to hit Germany. The contraband
provisions were systematically ex
tended on Aug. ',, L'O, Sept. 21, and
Oct. 29. 1914. On Nov. 1914, the
order of the British admiralty fol
lowed declaring the whole North sea
a war zone in which commercial
shipping would be exposed to most
serious danger from mines and men
of war. Protests from neutrals were
of no avail and from that time on
the freedom of neutral commerce '
with Germany was practically de- j
stroyed. Under these circumstances
fJermany was compelled to resort,
in February, 1915. to reprisals in
order to light her opponent's mens- ;
ures, which were absolutely contrary
to international law. She chose for
this purpose a new weapon, tho use
of which had not been regulated by
international law, and in doing so,
could and did not violate existing
rules, but only took into account the
peculiarity of this new weapon, the
submarine boat.
Dangvr for Neutral.
"The use of the submarine natu
rally necessitated a restriction of the
free movements of the neutrals and
constituted a dangor for them which
Germany intends to ward off by a
special warning- analogous to the
warning Kngland had given regard
ing the North sea.
"Both as belligerents Germanv
in her note of Feb. 17, and Great I
Britain in those of Feb. Is and 2v.
191√ñ, claimed that their proceedings
was only enacted in retaliation for
the violation of international law by
their opponents, the American gov
ernment approached both parties for
the purpose of trying to reestablish
international law as had been in
force before the war. Germany was!
asked to adapt the use of her new ;
weapon to the rules which had been
existing for the former naval'
weapons and Kngland not to inter
fere with the foot! supplies intended
for the r.oncombatant German pop- j
illation and to admit their distribu- '
tion under American supervision.
Germany, on March 1, 191T. de
clared her willingness to comply j
with the proposal of the American :
government, whilst Kngland. on the '
other hand, declined to do so. By j
the order in council of Man h 11,!
1915, Great Britain abolished even
w hat remained of the freedom of
neutral trade with Germany and her

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., March 8.
With ahcut one-tenth of the pre
cincts of the state heard from and
indications that it may he a couple
of days before all returns are in,
party leaders today were a bit hes
itant in predicting the outcome of
yesterday's first state-wide primary
in Indiana. The race on the repub
lican ticket for Fnited States sen
ator anil governor was the most ex
citing. Tlie vote in nearly 500 pre
cincts showed Jim Watson a slight
favorite over Harry S. New and Ar
thur Uobinson running far behind
in the race for the republican nom
ination for senator. For governor
in the same number of precincts
James P. Goodrich of Winchester
was far ot;t in the lead over Warren
T. McCray with Quiney A. Meyers
running away behind for third place.
The democratic poll was light and
contests were few. What returns
are in indicate that John A. M.
Adair of Portland, will be the nom
inee, for governor over Leonard B.
Clore. John W. Kern was unop
posed for senator.
Charles Warren Fairbanks' name
was on the republican ballots as
choice for president and Woodrow
Wilson and Thoma-s It. Marshall
were democratic choices for presi
dent and vice president.
Hull Moose Vote Light.
The bull moose vote in all parts
of the state was light. In Wayne
county, the former stronghold of the
moo?ers, the party was wiped out,
the progressives voting with the re
publicans in most instances.
In 4 9. precincts. scattered
throughout the state, the race for
senator on the republican ticket
showed Watson. 14.299; New-.
167; Uobinson, 3, HI 5. For governor
on the repuliean ticket, Goodrich
had 16.S41; McCray, 9.70t; Meyers.
3, 4 i S.
It "was thought in some quarters
that the choice for the senatorship
might be left to the convention be
cause of the closeness of the race in
the precincts which already have
been heard from. In many instances
the voters have failed to indicate
their second choice votes.
The total vote cast throughout the
state probably will be about (c j,pr
cent of the total for the republicans.
The democrats, because of the ab
sence of any keen rivalry for the
bitrger offices, polled a very light
vote.
Flection officials are working
fe-erlshly to get the vote to be tab
ulated as soon as possible, but the
rt turns are coming in slow and in
dications are the job will last many
hours yet.
Had yesterday afternoon been as
bright and spring-like as the morn
ing it is likely the primary would
have attracted many more voters to
the polls. Local storms in many
parts (ti the state and bad road con
ditions kept the vote down.
Tlie only serious disturbances
about the polling places occurred in
Terre Haute where Kd Kodgers and
I'd Holler were injured in a gun
dud between Itodsrers and Seymour
Jordan. Holler was an innocent
bystander and was shot in the leg.

Indiana, he bests Leonard B. Clore of Laporte 7S2 to 1 11,
