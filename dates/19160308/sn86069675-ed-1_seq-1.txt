Of this unusually bright and good

As n girl, she was bright, cheery,
and took to books, delving for
knowledge where profoundest of
scholars had pondered. As a wife,
she was thoughtful, helpful, and
loving. A mother's lovo went out
for her children; in them she saw'
.JKiatTpossibilities and in- tins- she
was happy at heart in the realistic
man and woman. Hers was a lifo

She lived through a period when
the souls of this loved Southland
wore tried as by firo; bleeding, torn;
destruction and desolation as writ
ten on every page and hurt mater
ially, her great hoart went out" in
pity for those who had overpowered
and wronged, and her spirit left its
clay tenement in love for all classes,
all people.
In state sho was on the mountain
tops, a star nt its zenith. Her home
life was that of a Ibvo character,
posing in firmness and qnnenly bear
ings. In her church, in active life,
sho was a leader. Tho question was,
what Is needed, and to duty's call
she responded most generously.
Tho pcoir found" in her a friend
and whether whito or black, nono
ever went away empty hande'd.
Her lifo exemplified this 'senti
ment: "Do your duty to God, your
self and your fellow-man and leave
the rest to Him who doeth all things
well." It has been well said every
page of life teaches the truth
"Tho paths of glory lead but to
tho grave."
"What is death? Oh, what is death?
'Tis the snapping of the chain,
'Tis tho breaking of tho bowl,
'Tis relief from every pain,
'Tis freedom of tho soul,
'Tis tho lifting of the sun,
To xiso again tomorrow,
A brighter course to run, ,
To sink again in sorrow.
Sjiichjis'death; yes, such is death.
What is death? Oh, what ia death?
'Tig slumber to tho weary,

'Tis snelter to the dreary,
'Tis peace amid the "storm,
'Tis entrance to our home,
'Tis passage to that God
Who bids His children como
When their weary course "Is trod.
Such is death; yes' such is death."
Father, bless, comfort and care for
those in sorrow.

HENRY. L JONES
' DIES StfDfeNLY"
Friends in this City Shocked
Learn of the Death of this
Popular Young Man.
to
The sad news that Mr. Henry L.
Jones, of the Grassy Lick neigh
borhood, died at the Good Samari
tnn Hospital in Lcxingtoa at 1:10
o'clock Tuesday morning will causa
much sorrow in this city and county.
Mr. Jones was stricken Sunday
tiight and on Monday afternoon wa3
rushed to Lexington, where an oper
ation was performed and it was dis
covered ho was suffering from gan
greno poisoning. He only lingered
a few hours after the operation but
retained consciousness until the
end. He expressed his willingness
'o meet uis Master face to face and
bis fervent prayer was "Not my will
but Thine be done."
Mr. Jones was only twenty-three
years of age and was married on
October 5, 1915 to Miss Mary
Dean, daughter of C. L. Dean. He
was a son of Mrs. Overton M. Jones
and was a young man of sterling
character, possessed with a faculty
for making and retaining his, friends
tnrough his sincerity nnd descrving
ness of trust. When a young man
just entering the arena of life, just
when the flower of youth has
blossomed into its fullness nnd when
living seems nt its sweetest ebb it
is indeed sad nnd difficult to under
tand why, with such bright pros
pects,' he should be called to enter
hi Heavenly" home, but He., that
doeth all things well,, knowetlwliest,
nnd we nil must bow our hends in
humble submission to the wil 1 of
the Master. Mr. Jones was 'popu
lar with old and young alike and
his friends and acquaintances are
heart-broken over the sad news.
The remnins were brought to his
home nt draasy Lick Tuesday morn
ing nnd the funeral will tnke place
at .he Grassy Lick Methodist church
this (Wednesdny) morning at ten
o'clock, burinl in Mnchpelah ceme
tery nnd services by RevSfWest.
Besides his wife nnd mother ,he
is survived by a sister, Elizabeth
and a brother, James.
Tho Advocate joins- countless
friends in extending deepest sym
pathy in this sad hour.
