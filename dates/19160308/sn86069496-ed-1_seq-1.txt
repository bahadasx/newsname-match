REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS OF
ADAIR.
(by h. d. bakek)
Aaron Redmon, who made a declara
tion under the acts of' 1818 and 1820,
was 76 years old. He enlisted from
Loudon county, Virginia, in the 12th
Regiment, Riflemen uKler Gapt. West,
Col. Morgan's command, and served
in this corpse twelve or thirteen
months, after which, he enlisted for
the war. He was at the battle of
Fort Washington, Monmouth, Bran-
dywlne, Germantown, Stony Point
and Trenton, besidesother smaller en
gagements.. He received a bayonet
flesh wound at Stony Point.
John Smith who made proof of serv
ices, was in the battle of Guilford, and
at Ramsey's Mill, on Deep river.
Moses Smith was also in said battels
Phillip Winfrey was at the Siege of
York. John Self who proves the serv
ices of Winfrey, was also present at
said time. The following: named sol
diers made proof of service but made
no detailed declaration, viz: William
Rogers, aged 74 years, Thomas Branon,
aged 83 years, William Janes aged 74
years, Charles Butterworth, aged 70
years, Matthew McGlasson, aged 77
years, Thomas White, aged 69 years,
Joseph Miller, aged 79 years, John
Shirley, aged 72 yearsjohu Polly, Josh
ua Atkinson, Robert Bushly, Solomon
Royse, Wm. H. Price, Thomas Coch
ran, Archibald Skaggs, John Tupman,
ages not given.
As has been observed in reading the
above sketclies, these soldiers of the
Revolution were all old. men when
they made their declarations and
proof of services their ages running
from sixty nine to ninety-eight years.
Many who served wjth thgra, and
came out to Kentucky as pioneers, had
died before the passage of the act of
1832, and hence, no record Js preserved
of their services. We have only given
those who made applications1 for pen
sions. If the sources of information
were available, it would be a pleasant
duty to furnish a record of all of them.
I will say in this connection, that I
am indebted to this old record book
for some facts of family history per
sonal to myself which it was the
means of revealing facts which
were unknown to any person then liv
ing. '- -
Some two or three years ago, I was
seated in the county -court clerk's
office, and something was said about
the information contained in this old
"record book. The clerk . arose- and
.took.lt fram-the case, and1 placlngvit
before me, remarked: "res., it

lt some Very interesting
reading.' I
opened it at random, andaslt happen
ed it was at the page contafafngj tpe
narrative of Col. David Trabue. As I
read down the page I -cme to this
statement; "He states that he is able
to prove substantially much of. the
services performed by him, by John
Baker and William Baker, of the
county of Cumberland," and that he
had procured their affidavits, which
would be filed with his application for
pension. Although these old men had
died before I was born, I knew that
William Raker was my grandfather,
and John was his brother. I also
knew from family tradition that four
brothers, James, John, Thomes and
William came from Chesterfield coun
ty, Virginia, about 1805, and settled
in .Cumberland county. It occurred to
me, that if John and William Baker
could prove the services of Daniel Tra
bue, they too, were perhaps In the
service.
I wrote to the Department at Wash
ington and In a few days received a
communication stating that they
were both soldiers in the war and in
forming meTthat William .t Baker was
borji December 17th, 1764 Chester
field county, Virginia, where he enlist

tiafirst enlistment in Jai'aary 1779,

burg; was in the battle of Peters
burg, and attack on Sudberry; that he
removed to Cumberland county, Ky.,
from Chesterfield county, Virginia, in
1805, and that he was granted a pen
sion, Certificate No., 6868, Issued
March B, 1833, under the act of June
7th, 1832.
They were a fine type of men, the
old pioneers, and early settlers, who
came into, and opened up the Green
and Cumberland river country, and it
is not a matter of wonder, that even
after the lapse of more than, a hun
dred years, the impress of tl eir lives
is seen and felt in their des endents,
not only here, but elsewhere n other
great commonwealth's of tt a Union,
whither they have gone in s larch of
home and fortunes. The N( rth, the
South and the great West have been
made rich by their contributions to
them of noble men and women, who
have assisted in building up new
states as their fathers andmothers as
sisted in making of Kentucky what it
Is.
Coming as our fathers' dld, largely
from the Mother State, Virginia,
many of them, (I might say, most of
them) soldiers of the Revolution, or
children of those who took part in
that great struggle, they brought
with them the spirit of independ
ence, the love of liberty personal and
political, which animated and sustain
ed them during that trying period,
and the sufferings, trials and priva
tions through which they passed in
subduing the wilderness to civiliza
tion,only served to Intensify that
spirit.
As we sit to-day in the- shade of our
home trees, surrounded by all that is
needed to make us comfortable and
happy, we should not fail to keep in
grateful remembrance the heroic vir
tues of the fathers and mothers, who
in times of danger, and with priva
tions that we can not now fully appre
ciate, with more than Spartan cour
age rescued from savage beasts and
more savage men, "Thedarkand Bloody
Ground," and made of it a habitation
for the generations which followed,
and will follow in the years .to come.
They fcund the country ar wilderness,
and they made of It a happy dwelling
place for their children; the forests
gave place to orchards; the cane fields
to fields of corn, wheat and verdant
meadow lands.
These old men, many of them, were
but little educated in books: they
would have been out; ofrplace in what
is called a polished circle of -Society,
yet they were educated and trained
for the work which they had to do.
They were alumni from another
school a school whose lessons are
never forgotten that of severe expe
rience and discipline. In it they
learned the lejssons which they needed
to know of courage, of endurance
and. self reliance, which enabled them
to meet hardships and overcome diffi
culties before which we perhaps would
stand, appalled.,

A Surprise Birthday Dinner.
Since time immemoral made it pos
sible for man to live, the human race
has always cherished a desirous "hope
for a long life, but so many are cut
down in their youth and even in mid
dle age by tho Grim Reaper. So few
ever reach and enjoy the age of 80
years and remain strong and erect. But
the suject of this sketch, Mr. W. F.
Neat, was 80 years old March 5th and
was joyously surprised. Sunday morn
ing at about 10 o'clock the neighbors
and friends began to gather at his
home with well-filled baskets and
boxes of the finest provision possible
and was served in the old fashioned
way.
Uncle Frank is one of the most
prominent men in Central Kentucky,
having served the people with high
esteem for over 60 years, principally in
both branches of the Kentucky Legis
lature and county court clerk for a
number of years and also worked in
the revenue service with confidence,
taught school, sold goods and various
other things, and always has a warm
heart and a broad smile on his face,
and the writer hopes and cherishes
the thought that he may enjoy many
more birthdays

A Test of Youth.
You often see a woman at the mar
ket pinching the end of a chicken's
breastbone to find out how tender in
other words, how young the fowl Is.
Oddly enough, the same test with
human beings is one of the most re
liable known. If in advanced life the
lower end of your breastbone feels
elastic when pushed inward, you may
assume that no important changes
have yet taken place in your arteries,
or otherwise in your anatomical make
up. The human breastbone is shaped
like an ancient Roman sword, and the
upper part of it is like the sword
handle. Its point is a piece of car
tilage, which anatomists call the
"xiphoid" cartilage. The early harden
ing and stiffening of it indicates that
the changes that accompany old age
have prematurely begun. Rupert
