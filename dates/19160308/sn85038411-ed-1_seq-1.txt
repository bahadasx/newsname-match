Germany's Latest Proposal to

First Step; Congress Will
Now Settle Down to Clear
ing Legislative Slate Which
Has Been Held Up
By .Associated Press
Washington. D. G., March 8. —With j
Congrass standing squarely behind j
him. President Wilson was prepared 1
10-day to go ahead with the submarine I
negotiations with the central powers, j
After .in all-day contest, such as has :
seldom been witnessed, the House last j
night aiiswered the President's de- |
in&nd for a "show down" on congres- j
sional sentiment on the armed ship,
issue. By a vote of 276 to 142 the'
House tabled the McLemore resolution
to warn Americans off armed ships.
This action, together with that in
the Senate in killing a similar reso-j
lutton. has freed the President from!
tli« bonds of embarrassment forced!
upon hint by the dissensions in Con- j
c ress.
Victory is Complete
His victory complete after a long!
and sensational fight was regarded by;
the President and his advisers as a.
sufficient answer to reports circulated !
in Berlin that he was making demands '
on Germany in direct opposition to the
i-iected representatives of the people. 1
Air. Wilson is hopeful that there will '
be as little further discussion of the i
issue in Congress as possible.
The President was much gratified I
with the overwhelming support ac
corded him. He is receiving many
congratulations.
Will Answer Germany
. The President's next step probably
Mill be to answer Germany's last pro
posal to settle the Lusitania case. In
'his the United States will ask for
further assurances guaranteeing that j
the new submarine campaign, in which
all armed merchant ships are to be
treated as auxiliary cruisers, will not .
endanger American lives.
With the armed ship issue out of the
way Congress was ready to-day to
mottle down to the task of clearing up
the legislative slate. Agitation on the
subject in Congress had delayed the
work of the session.
Turbulent Session
It was a big Democratic majority
ami neatly half of the Republicans in
t hp House that ended the movement to
warn Americans off armed ships. In
a turbulent session, lasting for seven
hours, and to rally cries of "stand by
the President," administration sup
porters without regard to party three
times placed their stamp of dis
approval on the warning proposition.
By a vote of 256 to 160 the adminis
tration forces carried the first vote, a
parliamentary proposition to prevent
opening the McLemore resolution to
amendment and unlimited debate.
With the crucial test of the fight in
hand they moved the adoption of a
special rule for four hours' discussion
of the resolution. This was carried
by 271 to 138 and then the victory was
completed by tablinc the resolution.
House Sways
During the debate that preceded
each vote the house was swayed back
and forth in a manner probablv un
eiualed since the eve of the decla
ration of war with Spain. The long
fliscussion, however, was conducted
with entire good feeling and there
was frequent c hering. The galleries
were packed throughout the day. The
President's supporters praised him for
keeping the country out of war and
for upholding international law. Ad
ministration opponents charged that
the President was contending for a
doubtful legal right and was shifting
the responsibility of diplomatic nego
tiations to Congress. The failure of
the so-called Bryan influences to de
velop any marked strength against the

By Associated Press
> Washington. March 8. The Ger-!
man Government, in a memorandum '■
! handed to-day by Count Von Bern- j
storff to Secretary Lansing, outlines)
in detail its position in regard to j
, armed ships, reviews events leading ]
up to its decision to torpedo without
warning all armed merchantmen of*
its enemies, concedes that interna- !
law, as at present constituted,'
I makes no provisions for the use of,
submarines and expresses a willing- j
ness to operate its submarines in ac-j
; cordance with international law pre-1
I vailing prior to the war on the con-i
; dltion that Great Britain does not j
| violate the same laws.
; The memorandum in part is as fol- J
1 lows:
I "The principle of the United States!
Government not to keep their citizens
■ off belligerent merchant ships, has;
been used by Great Britain and her j
.allies to arm merchantships for of- i
| fensive purposes. Under these clr- j
j cumstances merchantmen can easily)
| destroy submarines and if their attack :
! fails still consider themselves in safety!
i by the presence of American citizens t
j on board.
"The order to use arms on British
merchantmen was supplemented byi
| instructions to the masters of such]
■ ships to hoist false flags and to rami
|U boats. Reports on payment of
premiums and bestowals of decora-j
' tions to successful masters of mer- j
; chantmen show the effect of these j
i orders. England's allies have adopted
i this position.
Faces Blockade
"Now Germany is facing the follow-1
ing facts:
"(A) A blockade contrary to inter-j
national law (compare American notei
to England of November 5. 1915) has
for one year been keeping neutral;
I trade from German ports and is mak- j
ing German exports impossible.
"(B> For eighteen months through
i the extending of contraband provi
sions in violation of international law
(compare American note to England;
of November 5, 1915) the overseas!
I trade of neighboring neutral coun- j
! tries, so far as Germany is concerned, j
j has been hampered.
Interception of .Mails
"(C> The interception of mails in!
j violation of international law (com- i
I pare American memorandum to Eng-;
land of January 10, 1916) is meant to j
! stop any intercourse of Germany with
i foreign countries.
"(D) England, by systematically
and increasingly oppressing neutral
countries, following the principle of j
'might before right' has prevented
neutral trade on land with Germany,
so as to complete the blockade of thej
: Central Powers intended to starve j
| their civil population.
Armed Ships
"(E) Germans met by our enemies!
] on the high seas are deprived of their l
liberty no matter whether they are
I combatant or noncombatant.
, j "(F) Our enemies have armed their 1
i merchant vessels for offensive pur- 1
; poses theoretically making it inipos
i sible to use our IT boats according to
the principles set forth in the London
! Declaration (compare American;
; ; memorandum of February 8. 1916).
"The English white book of January
5, 1916, on the restriction of German
trade boats that by British measures
Germany's export trade has been stop
i ped almost entirely whilst her im
ports are subject to England's will.
| "The Imperial Government feels 1
1 confident thai the"people of the I
United States remembering the
friendly relations that for the last
hundred years have existed between
