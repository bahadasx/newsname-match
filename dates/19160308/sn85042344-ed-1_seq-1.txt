J' To the rallying fries of "n(and by
the iJi'UHUli'Yit," and "is It I.aiihlnn and
Wilson, or von Hernstorff and the
kaUdV" a hiK Ocmocratin majority
and nearly half of the lleinililicuiis In
the house rolled up overwhelming
votes against tho movement to warn
AmerieanH off the armed ships of the
Kuroptan helliKorents.
The colelrated Mel.einore resolu
tion, around which the unli-adminls-tratlon
forces centered their fiRht, was
taldcd in other words, killed Just
as was the Gore resolution for a lm
ilur purpose in the senate last week.
From the Very outset of the fishtlo
day the president's supporters without
regard to party swept over the opposi
tion. On the first vote which was a
parliamentary proposition to prevent
opening the .Mil,uiiore resolution to
amendment, and unlimited deliate, tho
Kdministrntion forces carried the day,
236 to 10. On that 192 Democrats,
t,:i ltepuhlirans nnd one Progressive
voted to support the administration.
Twenty-one Democrats, 132 Republi
cans, five Progressives, one Independ
ent and Representative London, the
lone Socialist of the house, voted
gainta it.
.Sensational StNsiou
This was the crucial vote of the
fiKht, the one point on which adminis
tration leaders wore uncertain.- With
victory in hand they moved on to the
next proposition, the adoption of a
special rule for four hours discussion
if the Mil.emore. resolution. Again
''they carried the day, this time 271 to
13S and then pushed their victory to
x a conclusion by tabling the JlcLcmoro
resolution, 27t to 142.
In seven hours of tense, turbulent
session. In which the administration
opponents chained that the president
Was contending-for a doubtful legal
right and was shifting the responsi
bility of diplomatic negotiations io
congress, the house swayed back nnd
forth in the most sensational congres
sional spectacle of a decade, probably
uneuuallcd since tho eve of the decla
ration of war on Spain.
President Wilson, calm nnd con
fident, heard the early results of the
voting in the cabinet room at tho
White House with some of the cabinet
grouped about him. He told them ho
was much gratified with the support
of congress. -
Continue Negotiations.
- lteleased from the bonds of em
barrassment forced upon him by tho
dissensions in congress, which have
been represented in foreign capitals
as indicating that lie was making his
demands on tlermany in direct op
position to the sentiment of the rep
resentatives of the people. President
Wilson now stands prepared to go on
with the submarine negotiations with
the central powers.
The next step probably will be an
answer to German's last proposal to
settle the Lusitaniu. case, in which the
I'nitcd States probably will ask for
such further assurances as it consid
ers sufficiently broad and complete
to guarantee that the new submarine
campaign which began on March 1
and in which notice has been given
that all ships carrying guns will bo
sunk without warning, will not en
danger Americans traveling the seas
am merchant vessels. ,
The president and his advisers re
gard the action of the house today as
u sufficient answer to reports circu
lated In Herlin sent from Washington
that congress stood two to one aaginst

Ono of the day's surprises wus ths

They paid little atention to the in
volved legal phases of the situation.
It was enough' they urgued, that th5
president had said tho reported attl-

enthusiasm lo the time when It will
be possible to have a new building
and thus give an opporunlly for carry
lug out all the various branches In
cluded in the organization.
Perhaps the department of great
est advantage to the majority of mem
bers of a Y. W. C. A. is the educa
tional branch. Kngllsh, arithmetic,
writing, in fact all of the common
school branches are taught by a com
petent director. The more elemen
tary business courses also are includ
ed. These features give to the busi
ness girl who has not been aide to

terday. He conferred with local news
paper editors regarding a plan to
combine all of the peace organizations

body to fight for tho supremacy of

try out of war.
"There are too many separate peace
organizations," said Mr. Kmbrey.
"and Individually they will never get
anywhere. What I hope to see is an
amalgamation of all these interests,
with the V. M. C. A., the boy scouts
und kindred bodies, with a view to
making a concerted effort to bring
about permanent and lasting peace In
our nation. The big thing we should
work for is to establish the safety of
American commerce on the high
