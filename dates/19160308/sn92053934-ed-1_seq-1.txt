Berlin, March S, (via London, 3:15
p. ni.) The capture of a French po
sition west of the Meuse on both sides
of the Forges brook below Bethin
court, sis kilometres wide and three
kilometres deep was announced today
by Gernfan army headquarters.
It was also announced that the vil
lages of Forges and Regneville, the
heights of Raben and the Cumieres
woods were in German possession
The capture of 58 officers, 3,277 men
and 10 canon is officially reported. In

semi-official announcement made here
today.

French Report.
The communication issued by the
French war office this afternoon says:
"In the Champagne district we
launched an attack which placed us
again in possession of trenches occu
pied by the enemy March 6. We took
So prisoners, including three officers
and captured a machine gun.
"In the Argonne our artillerymen
shelled the highways In the vicinity
of Mount Faucon over which it was
reported that automobile transports
"In the region north of Verdun no
change has been reported.
"There has been spirited artillery
fighting in the Woevre. We have bom
barded Blanzee, Grimaucourt and the
environs of Fresnes."
FJirlitinff Is Intense.
The battle of Verdun developed both
In intensity and in extent all day yes
terday and is now raging along the
line from Cheppy in the Argonne to
Fresne3 in the Woevre, showing that
the second attack for the stronghold
Is to be made on a larger scale than
the first. So far, according to the re
ports received here, the Germans, by
employing masses of men without
counting cost, obtained some slight
gains both to the west of the Meuse
Bud in the Woevre, where they carried
Fresnes after a fierce struggle.
Desperate fighting is again going on
on the left bank of the river. Follow
ing up the advantage of yesterday, the
Germans, going around the foot of the
slope, which served them as a mask, fol
lowed the railroad and entered Reg
nieville. From there they launched
15,000 men against hill No. 285, to the
east of Cote de L'Oie, and carried it.
Thus they control the loop of the
Meuse within which Regnieville is lo
cated. The French withdrew their
right from within the loop and It now
rests on the Meuse above Cumieres.
This withdrawal from an advanced
Position on the left bank became nec
essary according to the military ex
perts in order to maintain alignment
with the positions on the right bank,
nd it would have been difficult to
hold the advanced point which the
Germans could at the same time attack
In front and on the flank.
Rush Tactics Employed.
Having thus obtained command of
the slopes leading to the principal
French positions which run from
Rethincourt to Cote de L'Oie, by the
northeastern spur of Le Morte Homme
and the woods of C'orbeaux and Cum
ieres, the Germans without losing a
Moment's time hurled masses of In
fantry against these positions. They
gained a footing In the Corbeaux wood,
hut elsewhere their attacks were re
Pulsed with heavy losses. In this dis
trict centers at present the chief in
terest of the battle and the supreme
effort of the German troops is awaited
by the French with confidence, as they
rely on the strength of their defensive

WILSON BACK
AT SUB ISSUE
WITH BERLIN
Firmly Supported by Con
gress President Renews
Negotiations.
INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN
Count Bernstorff Presents
Documents Bearing the
German Viewpoint.
(Text memorandum on page 2.)
Washington, March S. With con
gress standing squarely behind him,
President Wilson was prepared today
to go ahead with the submarine nego
tiations with the central powers.
After an all-day contest, such as has
seldom been witnessed, the house last
night answered the president's demand
for a "showdown" on congressional
sentiment on the armed ship issue. By
a vote of 276 to 142 the house tabled
the McLemore resolution to warn
Americans off armed ships.
This action, together with that in the
senate in killing a similar resolution
has freed the president from the em
barrassment forced upon him by the
dissensions in congress.
His victory complete after a long
and sensational fight, was regarded by
the president and his advisers as a suf
ficient answer to reports circulated in
Berlin that he was making demands
on Germany in direct opposition to the
sentiment of the elected representa
tives of the people. Mr. Wilson is
hopeful there will be as little further
ihifion of the issue in congress-as
possible.
Meiuorandnm Presented.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, today, at the instruction
of his government, handed to Secretary
Lansing a long memorandum explain
ing in detail the German position in
regard to armed merchant ships and
the causes leading up to the decision
of the central European powers to tor
pedo without warning all armed mer
chantmen of their enemies.
Secretary Lansing and Count von
Bernstorff declined to divulge its con
tents. It is understood to contain the
allegation that Great Britain had taken
advantage of the contention of the
United States that Americans must be
safe on defensively armed merchant
men, to have those ships act offensive
ly toward enemy submersibles.
Willing to Observe Laws.
The German government, it is under
stood, concedes that as submarines are
a new engine of warfare, international
law makes no provision for their use.
The German government is under
stood to express a willingness to op
erate its submarines in accordance
with international law prevailing prior
to the war, providing Great Britain
does not violate the same laws.
Proof Against British.
It is understood that the memoran
dum contends that evidence appeided
to the late German announcenent
proves that British ships armed os
tensibly for defense have been In
structed to act and have acted offen
sively and that they are not peaceful
traders as the United States was as
sured they would be by Sir fecil
Spring-Rice, the British ambassaior.
The memorandum is understocd to
reiterate previous declarations that
submarine warfare was begun by
Germany in reprisal for the anroun
ced intention of Great Britain to
starve the civilian population of the
central empires and also is urler
stood to refer to the long friendship
between the United States and ier
many with hope that the Amercan
people will appreciate the posiion
Germany finds herself in as a reult
of the blockade.
Supporting the contention that Ger
many's reprisals are justified. :he
memorandum is said to enumeute
various actions of Great Britain wtch
have operated against the Interests of
neutrals and their citizens.
To sustain the German contentins
it is pointed out that Germany agred
to abide by certain terms of the dec
laration of London but that inasmrh
as Great Britain has not restraied
her actions to conform with the tens
of that declaration, Germany cannt
be expected to agree to operate uner
a code which Great Britain disregars.

THE WAR
TODAY
Pausing on the ground tbey had
won on Monday and Tuesday in
their impetuous dash southward
to the west of the Meuse, the
forces of the German crown
prince, fighting for erdnn, failed
to continue last night their drij
ing attacks on the attacks on the
French lines. Renewal of the
' great battle, however, is being
momentarily awaited.
The assault on the fortress is
now being pressed along the four
mile front from north of Cum
ieres, near the river to ltethin
court, where the Germans have
pressed forward into the Cor
beaux woods, between Iead Man
and Goose hills, the commanding
positions held by the French in
this sector.
By heavy bombardment follow
ed by an infantry attack the Ger
mans were able yesterday to gain
a foothold in Corbeaux Wood,
northward of Verdun and to cap
ture Hill 2G5 to the southeast.
Their casualties were very heavy
according to a Paris report. The
attack extended over the entire
front from Belhincourt to the
Meuse river, but with the excep
tion of the two points mentioned,
the French held back the Ger
mans. Thus the French still hold
tJie important strategic positions
on the heights of the Cote de
L'Oie, for the possession of which
numerous battles have been
fought. It is estimated that the
Germans have advanced about
three miles since they took the
town of Forges.
The Germans have recaptured
from the French a position in
Champagne, have pushed their
line forward in the Argonne for
est and have expelled small Brit
ish detachments from captured
G'ernian trenches northeast of
Yermelles, according to a German
official report
According to the current official
statement from Constantinople
fhe British army under General
Ajlmer on the way to the relief
of General Townsend at Kut-EI-Maru,
bus been making renewed
efforts to advance. It is declared,
however, that all Its attempts
failed.
Home advices indicate that Italy
has determined to make every ef
fort to retain possession of the
Avlona section, at the southerly
end of Albania. Allied troops have
withdrawn from virtually all the
other Albania territory to the
north in the face of the Austrian
advance southward.

ILLINOIS DAM
IS USED FOR
PBIVATEGAIN
Charge Made That State
Property Is Being Con
trolled by Capital ,
ASK GOV. DUNNE'S AID
Trustees Appeal to Execu
tive to Get Release of
Public Utility.
Springfield, 111., March 8. Trustees
of the sanitary district of Chicago, and
members of the Illinois and Michigan
canal commission conferred today
with Governor Dunne. "We want the
governor to help us to get control of
the power dam at Joliet, now leased
by the public service corporation of
northern Illinois," said James M. Dail
ey, chairman of the finance committee
of the sanitary district. "This power
should be used for public and not pri
vate gain."
"The conference was called by Gov
ernor Dunne," said Trustee Wallace
Clark of the sanitary district.
"We told the governor this dam at
Joliet should be developed to Its full
est extent and all the power used for
the public good. T.le governor said ho
was for the public every time."
Controlled CO Years.
The trustees explained that the pow
er dam, which belongs to the state,
and which is leased at 20 Tears inter
vals.by SiA-Winxttiissiatiers of the Illi
nois and Michigan canal has been con
troled for the past 60 years by what is
now the Public Service Corporation of
Northern Illinois. "They pay the state,
or rather the canal commission $9,500
annually," said Chairman Dailey. "If
the power were developed to its limit
it would be worth much more than this
at least seven or eight times as much.
We want the governor to lend us his
influence with the commissioners so
that they will make the development
of the power at Joliet a requirement in
the next advertisement for bidders to
lease the power. If this is done we
don't believe we will have any com
petition. If we get the contract or
rather the lease, we will use much of
the power to light the city of Chi
cago." State Could Use Money.
President Sherman Marshall of
Ipava, of the I. and M. canal commis
sion said the governor believed the
money derived from the power dam
could be used to widen and deepen the
canal between Chicago and Joliet, so
that it would meet the requirements of
the proposed Illinois deep waterway.
The public service corporation's con-,
tract for the power dam expires in
July, it was stated, and the canal com
missioners will advertise for bids some
time in May.
