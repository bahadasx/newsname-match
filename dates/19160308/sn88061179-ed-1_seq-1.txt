THE PREVEN 1 ION OF TY?

Among tie-causes of death in
ihr United States typhoid foyer
rank s fourth {tuberculosis comes

an.I typhoid fever. In
there were 3ft,.leaths from
this di-ea>e in t im United States,
and in 19 111 the niimher of
deaths were- reduced tu 25,000,
representing'J?h.I"'" cases. Tlie
tiunua! eeoneiiiic loss f ruin this
disease in the United States is
estimated at ever fV>i>tl 000
in the value of the lives lost

Iis Cause.
This is a communicable I
disease, due to a small niidrOH
oopie organism, called the Ha-I

lives normally only in the
human body ami will die m a'
vpry short time after reaching'
the outside world unless pi"

Prevention.
The exercise of care in hand?
ling ease:, of typhoid fever and
in the proper disposal ami dis
I infection of bedding, clothing,
body discharges, otc, will have
much to 'In in preventing the
disease. The use of a sanitary
privy er method of sewage ilia-1
jiosul, in which Ities cannot
leach tie* excreta, and which is I
located at a safe distance (1?0
feet er more) from a stream or
source of waler supply is a most '
effective method preventing the
ilisease. This is especially true
in the ease of ''typhoid car?
riers", i. e. persons who con?
tinue to give off typhoid bacilli ,
in their bowel discharges even j
after they are cured of the
disease. In'adopting any type
pail or pit -lypei of sanitary I
