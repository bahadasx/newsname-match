Reason for Decision Against
Armed Merchantmen .
Interest today in the question or
warning Americans off armed
ships shifted to the Senate, where
Senators arc still not disposed to
let the issue drop.
This is true despite the record
vote in the Senate against tho
Gore resolution and the ;vote of
276 to 142 by which the House last
night tabled the. McLcmore resolu

by Ambassador vbnBcrnstorff's visit
to the State Department, He delivered
a memorandum to Secretary Lansing,
explaining his government's reasons
for declaring that armed merchant
men would be attacked by submarines
without warning.
The action was necessitated, the
memorandum says, by numerous vio
lations of International law by the
allies, England especially, which vio
lations, the memorandum says, have
beon acknowledged by the American
Government.
Germany specifies the following al
leged violations by England of Inter
national law:
"A blockade contrary to Interna
tional law" tb keep neutral trade
from German ports and to make Ger
man exports Impossible.
The hampering of trade between nei
tral countries through the extending of
contraband provisions In violation of
International law.
The Interception ot mall In violation
of Internationa' law, meant to stop My
Intercourse of Germany with" foreign
countries.
' The attempt to starve the civil popu
lation of the central powers by the re
striction on neutral trade.
The taking of German civilians on the
high seas.
The arming of morchantmen for of
fensive purposes.
Justifies Charges.
In all the casn except the alleged at
tempt to starve the civil population and
the capturing of German civilians on
the seas tho German memorandum al
leged Its charges aro Justified by speci
