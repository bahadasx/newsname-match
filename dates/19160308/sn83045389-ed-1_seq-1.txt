it stands iirhind him in the submarine
negotiations with Ocrinany.

in other worils. killed?just as was the
tiore resolution for a similar purpose
in the Senate last week.
SWKKI* OV10II OPPOSITION
WITIIOl'T IIK(iAHI) TO I'AllTY
From the very outset of the light
to-day the Preaident'a supporters, with
; out rcy.ard to party, swept over the
opposition.
?>n the first vote, which was a parlia
mentary proposition to prevent opening
the Mchcmore resolution to amend
ment and unlimited debate, the admin
istration forces carried the day. "56
n> K?o. <'n that, 1!>2 Democrats. sixty
three Republicans and one Progressive
voted to support the administration.
Twenty-one democrats, 132 Republi
cans. tive Progressives. one Independent
and Representative London, the louo
Socialist of the House, voted against
it.
This was the crucial vote of the
Huh:, the one point on which adminis
tration leaders were uncertain. With
\ Ictory in hand, they moved on to th?*
next proposition, the adoption of it
special rule for four hours' discussion
of the Mcl.cmore resolution.
Again they carried the day, thin
time C7I to J.IS, and then pushed their
victory to a conclusion by tabling tlw>
Mcl.cinore resolution, U71? to 142.
SWAVS HACK A.VD FORTH
IN SKXSATIO\Alt SI'KCTACl.E
In seven hours of tense, turbulent
session, in which the administration
opponents charged that the President
was contending for a doubtful legal
right, and was shifting the responsibil
ity of diplomatic negotiations to Con-'
grcss, the House swayed back an<-|
forth in the most sensational congres
sional spectacle of a decade, probably
not equaled since the eve of the decla
ration of war on Spain
President Wilson, calm and Confident,
heard the early results of the voting
In the t*abiiii't room at the White Hotifis
with some of the Cabinet grouped about
him. lie told them he was much grati
fied witli the support of Congress.
Released from the bonds of embar
rassment forced upon him by the dis
sensions in Congress, which have been
represented in foreign capitals as in
dicating that he was making his de
mands on C.ertnany in direct opposi
tion to the sentiment of the elected
representatives of the people. President
Wilson imw stands prepared to go on
with the submarine negotiations with
the central powers.

The iiiwi stop probably will be an
answer to tJermany's last proposal to
.?"(tie tin- l.usitania ease, in which the
lulled States probably will ask for
such further assurances as it considers
sufficiently broad ami complete to
guarantee that the new submarine cam
paign. which began 011 March !. and
in w Itich a note has been given that
all ships carrying guns will be sunk
without warning, will not endanger
Americans traveling the seas on mer
chant vessels
The President and his advisers regard
t!i?* action of i lie House to-day as a
siitliclent answer to reports circulated
in Merlin, sent from Washington, that
Congress stood two ti> on-- against him
in the cri.?is
one of the day's surprises was the
failure of the so-called "Hrv an infu
eiioe" 11> develop anv apnreclahle
strength against the President.
"Stand by the President and do not
embarrass him in his diplomatic nego
tiations with foreign < ountrles" was
the whole burden <>f the argument of
the administration leaders They paid
little attention to the involved legal
phase* of the situation. It was enough,
they argued, that the President ha<|
said the reported attitude of Congrestt
a.s opposed tii his policy w a < cmharra***
iiik hhn abioad, and to that tlicj atiK'K.
