DEATH OCCURRS AT HOME ON
GAY STREET, MONDAY EVEN
ING, MARCH 6, 1916.
FUNERAL TO BE THURSDAY AFTERNOON
Enters Upon Rest After Long Years
of Usefulness. Is Mourned by
Large Family.
Mrs. John Evans passed away at the
family residence on Gay street Mon
day night, March 6, 1916, after an ill
ness resulting from a fall on Febru
ary 19th. Her illness was not con
sidered serious at first but compli
cations and the weakness cf age
baffled medical skill and the loving
care of her family.
Funeral services will' be held at
the family home on Thursday after
noon at two o'clock, Rev. W. A. Mont
gomery, pastor of the Presbyterian
church, officiating. Interment will be
made in Oakland cemetery.
Elizabeth Jones was born in Card
iganshire, South Wales, November 23,
1834. In July, 1857, she cam,0 to Amer
4 ica and joined relatives in Wiscon
sin. On January 2, 1858, she was
married to Mr. John Evans, who was
ajpo of Cardiganshire, and the young
couple founded their home on a Wis
consin farm. Later they decided to
join their old neighbors the D. W.
Jones family, and in 1863 moved to
Iowa. Their first location was the
Seth Brown farm north of Manches
ter, but a short time later they
bought land in Coffins Grove town
ship, and by untiring industry, effort,
and self-denial converted the raw
prairie into a fine farm. In working
out this financial success Mrs. Evans
bore her full share as a true help
meet but a greater work was her's,
for she made the farmhouse "liome"
to her large family, and no labor or
eelf-secrifice was too great for her
to make if it would promote the com
fort and happiness cf husband and
children. While she was unusually
devoted to her home and famiY she
was a woman of broad sympathies
and was ever ready to nurse a sick
neighbor or help those in trrouble.
Her hospitality made the home at
tractive to many outside the family
cirole. Though quiet and retiring in
disposition her love and devoted ser
vice won her the friendship cf all
who knew her and made "mother"
the ideal of her family.
Mrs. Evans was Unitarian in faith.
.. She was a first cousin to the well
"known Unitarian clergyman, Rev.
Jenkin Lloyd Jones.
aio"JM[r. and', Mrs, Evans were horn,

'Warden, Washington Mrs.' Margaret
Glenriy, of Independence Mrs. Har
ry Sly, of near Manchester, and
Mary, who lives wi4h her parents,
in the home on Gay street, to which
they removed when advancing years
made it necessary for them to give
up the activities of the farm. Mrs.
Evans is also survived by twenty
four grand-children and four great
grand-children.
The sympathy will be especially
*. tendered to her aged husband, "bereft
of her who has been his devoted
companion and helpmeet for fifty
eight years.
