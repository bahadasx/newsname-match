St. J. A. A. A. Benefit.
The St. Johnsbury Academy Athlet
ic association has arranged a clever
program for their annual benefit which
will be held in Academy hall Friday
evening at eight o'clock. The main
attraction is the well-known monolog
ist, Edward H. Frye. of Boston. Mr.
Frye comes here well recommended by
the press and public and those in
charge of the program are confident
that it will be one of the best features
ever presented at the academy.- It is
expected that his selection for Friday
night will be Joseph C. Lincoln's fam
ous work "Cap'n Warren's Wards."
Many St. Johnsbury people have heard
Mr. Frye and are very loud in his
praise. Other numbers ,will be fur
nished by the Boys' Glee club, Girls'
Glee club and the Academy orchestra.
The excellence of the program com
bined with the fact that a contest is
being waged between the classes in the
sale of tickets insures a good crowd.
The standing of the classes in the
ticket selling contest is registered on
a thremometer in the chapel each
morning and the winning class will be
awarded a prize of five dollars by the
Athletic association. Sports cost mon
ey and effort. The various teams re
presenting the school have been put
ting forth the effort during the past
year, and now it is no more than fair
that the others should contribute to
ward the financial end.

WOMAN'S CLUB MEETING
Address By Prof. Lambert On Modern
Science and Public Welfare.
The business of the March meeting
of the Woman's club included the
secretary's report and the quarterly
statement of the treasurer, also some
recommendations by the executive
board, notices regarding the lecture to
be given by Dr. Dalton. Mrs. F. H.
Brooks spoke of the suffering soldiers
and urged the co-operation of club
women In the work to be begun for
their relief at the South church Wed
nesday afternoon.
After a delightful selection by the
Woman's club chorus, Mrs. Minnie
Tolman, chairman of the Social Sci
ence committee, presented Prof. Lam
bert of Middlebury college, who spoke
most earnestly on "Modern Science in
its Relation to Public Welfare." Prof.
Lambert said a modern scientist had
two reasons for his work, namely, to
obtain truth for truth's, sake, and also
the desire to make the world a little
better and a little safer place to live
in. In his plea for the theorist, he
showed how the practical man "was de
pendent on the theorist, for it is ne
cessary that truth be found before it
can be applied. He took his audience
over the pathway by which men have
found out things to prevent diseases,
giving the story of experiments in mal
aria and yellow fever, which have
been Invaluable in the checking of
these evils. The charts illustrating
certain phases of public welfare were
most illuminating and interesting.
Following the address Mrs. Susan
Smith gave notice of a proposed
change in the by-laws in regard to
membership dues. Mrs. Hovey - an
nounced that a committee of five had
been appointed for investigating the
work of the club, to see If It was in
line with the federation work. These
ladies, were asked to serve on that
committee, Mrs. Cross, Mrs. Benedict,
Mrs. Mackinnon.
Work on the Odd Fellows block Is
progressing rapidly and it is practically
ready for the interior finish. The C.
C. Locke company expect to occupy the
north store in about a month and 11.
J. Goodrich already has his new en
trance in use. This adds' two modern
stores to Railroad street and is a dis
tinct improvement to that part of the
village.
