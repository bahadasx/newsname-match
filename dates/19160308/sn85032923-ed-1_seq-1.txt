WASHINGTON. March 6. Three
drcadnaughts and four battle cruisers
added to the American fleet built and
authorized, will make it the equal in
fighting strength of the present Ger
man fleet. Admiral Fletcher, com
mander of the Atlantic fleet, declared
before the house naval committee to
day. While Germany has seven bat
tle cruisers, the United States has
none. The admiral said that the 35
knot craft proposed by the navy de
partment will be so much superior to
anything afloat that four of them and
possibly three, will more than offset
Germany's seven.
