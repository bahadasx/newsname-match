Pnu Attack Resolution.
Mr. Pou attacked the McTemore reso
lution at the onlaet of the debate.
"It means In effect, that If an American
disregards a
warning that the United
mates government will fold ita hands,
lie said. "Is there a single red-blooded
citizen In this house or this country who
ants to do that? It Is charged the presi
dent wants war. All the Imps o hell
never devised a more infamous charge
Ja man since Abraham Lincoln haa gone
through such at test aa the president has
gone through in the last six months. He
not sacrifice a single life to make hln-
avu prvtfiutni lor H juriinie. no una bu)
port on both sides of this chamber. He
haa support on the democratlo aide arid
distinguished support on the other side.
Only the other day I read a statement
of former President Taft . supporting
him.-'
Applause on both Sides of the chamber
followed his remarks.
Campbell Sasrsrrat Sabatttat.
When Representative Campbell, repub
lican, arose to speak he read a substi
tute he ; said he would propose if a
motion to. end debate on the rule did not
carry. It follows:
8ubtltute la Read. .
"Resolved. That In the opinion of the
house of representatives citlxena of the
Urv.ted States under existing, conditions
and Irrespective - of their" ' legal right
ought to refrain from taking paasage on
armed vessels of belligerent nations, ex
cept in the case of imperative necessity."
"There is no great question of national
rights Involved in this issue," declared
Mr. Campbell, "nor is there any great
crisis Involving the honor of the United
States at this time. Does any on con
tend that an American cltisen haa a right
to travel on an armed cruiser of a na
tion at war?
"The thing today la to avoid war. The
question ought not to have been brought
here," he continued. "Now it vls here,
vote squarely on a resolution warning
citizens of the danger they are In when
they get on armed ships of a belligerent."
Scattered applause from the democratic
ldo greeted. Representative Oardner, re
publican, who spoke on the parliamentary
status of the McLemore resolution.
"If you want to stand with the presi
dent and two ex-presldents you will vote
to sustain the rule and table the McLe
more resolution," he said.
No Thought of War.
"The thought furthest from President
Wilson's mind lsa desire for war." de
clared Representative Bennett, repub
lican of New Tork. . He attacked . the
rule, however, as "cowardly, evasive and
treacherous.' He complained that the
house gave many hours to routine busi
ness and would give only feur hours to
consider a resolution "Involving war."
Representative Graham of Pennsylvania,
republican, declared;

WASHINGTON, March 7. Rp.
clal Telegram.) The nne big; up
standing thought that stands out In
the several votes taken today, on
the previous question, on the rule.
and on' the McLemore resolution
Itself warning Americans to stay off
armed merchantmen ships Is that
President Wilson "said It." "Said
what?, asks the searcher after
knowledge.
That the president said in sub
stance, as charged by Senator Gore
of Oklahoma, "that war with Ger
many at this time might not be un
desirable in the interest of the
United States and in the course of
civilization," or words to that effect.
The party whip never cracked so
loudly nor bit as keenly as today
and in many instances livid marks
appeared "that will take months to
heal, If ever. It was the pressure of
the administration that brought vic
tory, aided by the seaboard repub
licans, who, for very obvious reasons
voted with the president's forces to
day. To t III Fare.
The form of the McLemore resolution
was not satisfactory and thereby weak
ened the oposltion. but it presented a
most remarkable parliamentary situation,
in that it denied what the president asked
tor nnd at the same time la claimed as a
complete vindication by the followers of
Mr. Wilson. The "old man said It, but
we are jrolnn to save his fa.ee." that
about outlines the situation In explana
tion of the vote to table the McLemore
resolution. 276 for to 143 against, and
voting In the negative was the solid delo-f-atlon
from Nebraska, the solid delega
tion from Iowa and the solid delegation
from Mlnnespta, as predicted in former
dispatches.
The vote on the previous auestlon
rather surprised the republicans from
Nebraska to find Bhallenberger "aye"
with them, while Lobeck and Stephen
voted ;'ao,"4hl -rota in the- f Uai .nafymH
indicating that the administration forces
were thoroughly well intrenched and with
accessions" from tho ranks of the repub
licans could easily defeat any affirmative
action on the part of the house so far aa
"warning; to Americans" went.
Reavls Explain Vote.
In explaining- his vote against tabling
the McLemore resolution, Congressman
Reavls made a really splendid speech In
a day of oratory. He told the house he
was compelled to do so, not because he
favored the measure, but If the motion to
table was defeated It would give him an
opportunity to present an amendment, the
substance of which was:
"That in the opinion of the house of
representatives, citlxena of the United
States, under existing conditions and
Irrespective of their leal rights, ought to
refrain from taking passage on armed
vessels of belligerent nations, except in
cane of imperative necessity, and the con
sideration of the resolution and amend
ments thereto shall proceed under the
five-minute rule to a final vote on
passage."
He said the amendment would violate
no principle of international law and pre
serve the right of Americans to travel
on belligerent ships armed for defensive
purposes would caution them to refrain
from exercising that right.
"I would not put angiilah and despair
Into American homes," said Mr. Reavls,
"In order that some Irresponsible crazy
man shall have the right to travel on the
armed ship of a belligerent nation."

Allies Dictate Just
What May Be Sent
From New York City
WASHINGTON, March ,7.-Oreat Brit
ain and France were described today aa
virtually dictators as to what kind of
commodities shall be exported through
the port of New Tork In a statement to
the Interstate Commerce commission by
C. J, Austin of the New Tork Produce
exchange. Mr. Austin was the first wit
ness today at the informal conference
between shippers and carriers on the
problem of congested freight terminals
at eastern seaports.
"It la well known." said Mr. Austin,
"that the British government dictates
what we shall ship and what we shall
not ship. A ship which loads without
permission of the Rrltlsh government, is
immediately requisitioned. The same con
dition applies now to French lines. The
allies have their finaers on nearly every
thing afloat."
A representative of the Nebraska State
Railway commission testified that grain
prndurers in that state ate facing serious

Big Task Imposed
Upon War Fleet
Of Great Britain
LONDON. March 7. A. J. Balfour, fli.it
lord of the admiralty, stated In tiio
House of Commons this afternoon tlinl
the tonnage of the British navy had been
increased by 1,000,000 since the outbreiK
of the nr, while the strength of the air
division of the navy had grown ten-fold
Mr, Balfour emphasized the magnitude
of the task Great Britain haa taken
upon Itself since the operations In the
Mediterranean begin in transporting,
fading and supplying the forces there.
Moreover the appearance of German aub-
fnarlnftfl tint ntilv In hntviM u.- d a. ttit In
the Mediterranean had added- to tha
responsibilities, already tindrtaken.m4J''"Of the BUte legislature and for
raid about 1,000,000 combatant. 1,OOO,0)
liorrea, 1,500,000 tona of stores and $7,CO00)t)
gallons of oil for the allies had been
transported. This task, in the prveenee
of hostile submarines had . thrown an
enormous amount of work upon the ad
miralty which could not have ben fore
seen at the outbreak of the war. The
dangers experienced were new danger
and he felt the nation could look with
satisfaction upon the manner in whloh
tho admiralty had carried out 1U vast
work.
Mr. Balfour remarked Incidentally that
his predecessor. Colonel Winston Apenoer
Churchill was completely Justified, when,
reviewing circumstances at the outbreak
of the war he claimed that the fleet he
had prepared was adequate for the great
tank of maintaining command of the seas.
Mr. Balfour said the British fleet had
become an International fleet, carrying
on international work and serving many
natio.

WASHINGTON, March 7. The Depart
ment of Commerce located one ot the

Fifteen other Volturno heroes still are
