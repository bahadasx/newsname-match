of the efforts of County Farm Dem?

others Interested in the welfare of the
rural schools of the county, a teacher
will be employed at an early date to
teach agriculture In several schools.
In order to secure this valuable ad?
dition to their faculties the schools
were required to possess certain quali?
fications. It was necessary that five
schools qualify, and four of them,
Pine Hill, Bowman, Four Holes and
Limestone, have already done so. A
number of schools aro making an ef?
fort to get the fifth plaoe, and no de?
cision has been reached as yet.

OFFICERS AND MO m.
ATLANTIC PLEET .SOMEWHAT
SHORT OF BOTH.
Admiral Fletcher on Stand Tolls of
Need of Increase in Personnel
Efficient D?eptte the Lack.
Washington, March 3.?Only 15 of
tho 21 battleships of the Atlantic fleet
are on active duty in Weit Indian
waters, three of the other ?X being
so crippled lor lack of officers and
men that they can not opesste with
the fleet and the other three are
awaiting or undergoing extensive re?
pairs. The US active ships art short
from eight to 17 f>fflcers each of the
number assigned to them by $he navy
department and 1,000 coal passers,
electricians, gunners' mates and other
! trained enlisted men, although they
have aboard about 100 more Caen than
the total perso nnel allowed Jby reg?
ulations. ?
This was the situation of the fleet
as pictured today by Admiral'Fletcher
commander in chief, before the house
; naval committee. He added that in
his opinion ancl that of varioss boards
of officers who had studied the sub?
ject, the battleships squadr?hS of the
active fleet required at least 5,000 ad?
ditional men over the complements
now assigned. The shortage in the
various ratings, he explained, how?
ever, would not materially injure the
efficiency of the fleet were it called
upon Immediately to engage an
enemy.
The lack of officers wag the most
serious aspect, Admiral Fletcher
thought, because it requires ^0 years
to train a competent lieutenant or
lieutenant commander. Nothing that
congress, much less the navy, depart?
ment can do, he said, can r?
situation at once. He tho
only effective and logical
crease the numter of officers,
to increase the Annapolis
to 2,000 men and await
opment.
Admiral Fletcher devoted,
tire day before the com!
questions of . personnel u
tiohs by Representatives

ments presented by the bureau of
navigation', tho general board and
Admiral Fletcher himself were dis?
cussed at length.
AGAINST SINGLE CROP* SYSTEM.
Seven Objections to One-Crop Agricul?
ture Practiced on Many Southern
Farms.
Clemson Colege, March l.t^-At a
conference of Southern bankers,
Bradford Knapp, chief of extension
work in the South, made an address
no "Safe Farming" in which he stated
seven objections to the one-crop sys
tern of agriculture and offered sug?
gestions as to what could constitute
"safe farming" for the South. This
address Is reprinted in Circular 56,
office of the secretary, and can be od
talned by writing to the department
of agriculture, Washington. The rea?
sons why the one-crop system is un?
safe are stated as follows:
First. Because the system depends
upon market and crop conditions of
the one crop alone. Failure of crop
or failure of market ali'ie bring se?
rious disaster.
Second.. Because it does not pro?
vide for the maintenance of soil fer?
tility.
Tnird. Pc arise it fails to provide
for a sufficient livestock Industry to
consume tho waste products of tho
farm and make its wasto lands pro?
ductive.
Fourth. Because it does not pro?
vide for a system' of farm manage?
ment under which labor, teams, and
tools may be used to tho fullest ad?
vantage.
Fifth. Because it brings return in
cash but once a year instead of turn?
ing the money over more than once
a year.
Sixth. Because it d oes not pro?
duce tho necessary foods to supply
the people upon the farm and keep
them in health and strength.
Seventh. Because it limits knowl?
edge, narrows citizenship, and does
not foster homo-bull ding, but docs
encourage commercial farming.
This circular will be of Interest
and value to every farmer, merchant
and banker In South Carol! na. Bank?
ers in rural communities especially
should possess themselves of copies
of It.

OVER 3,003 LIVES LOST.
TRAGEDY OF AUXILIARY CRUIS?
ER LA PROVENCE ON FEB.
2* ONE OF GREATEST
ON, RECORD.
Ship Was Transporting; Soldiers to
Saloniki?Statement Issued Feb?
ruary 29 Says No Submarine Signs
Were Noticed Before or After Sink?
ing. ,
Paris, March 3.?It was announc?
ed at the French ministry of marine
today that there were nearly 4,000
men on board the French auxiliary
cruiser La Provence when she was
sunk in the Mediterranean on Feb?
ruary 26.
* It was stated that on board the
La Province were the *j?%ff of the 3d
colonial Infantry rog'Tymt, the 3d
battalion, the 2d company of the 1st
batalion, the' 2d machine gun com?
pany and one extra company, in all
nearly 4,000 men. >
As the ministry of marine . on
February 29 announced that the num?
ber of survivors of the La Provence
disaster was estimated at 850, it is in?
dicated by the foregoing dispatch that
upwards of 3,130 lives were lost.
The loss of more than 3,000 lives in
the sinking of the French auxiliary
cruiser La Provence is the greatest
ocean disaster of modem times. Up
to the present the largest number of
lives ever lost In one wreck was when
the White Star liner Titanic struck
an iceberg off the New Foundlan^
Banks on April 14, 1912, and sank
with a death loss of 1,5')? 5. The res?
cued numbered 743.
The French ministry of r^rine had
previously issued no statements as to
the number of persons on the La
Provence when she went down; ? *
The vessel, however, when hr the
trans-Atlantic service could carry
960 persons, including the crew, and
tt has been presumed that, as she
was transporting troops between* ports
not far apart, she was carrying a
, number of men larger than her nor?
mal capacity.
i . The official' statement of February
29 announcing the sinking of the
Provence II (so designated to distin?
guish her from the French battleship
Provence,) engaged in transporting
troops to Saloniki, was sunk in the
Mediterranean on February 26. Two
hundred and ninety-six survivors have
been brought to Malta, and about 400
to Melos by French and British pa?
trol vessels summoned bv wireless.
"No signs of a submarine were no?
ticed before or after the cinking. La
Provence was armed with five can?
non of 14 centimetres, two of 57-milli?
metres and four of 47 millimetres."
SOUTHERN WELFARE AGENT.

Atlanta, Ga., March 2.?The South?
ern Railway Company announced
here today the appointment of a wel?
fare agent at a salary of $3,600 per
year "to provide Its employees with
better opportunities for moral, so?
cial and industrial uplift." The Rev.
Charles L. Bass, a Methodist preach*
er, about 35 years old. wps given the

ticing* attorney ana a member of the
Georgia legislature, joined the Metho?
dist ministry several years ago and
was assigned to a church at Inman
Yards, a suburb, where the Southern

yards. Card playing, drinking and
various petty disorders were frequent
i:i that section then, the announce
i
ment said, but shortly after Bass went
there "the place was pervaded by a
different moral atmosphere." This,
it was said, led to creation of the of?
fice of welfare agent, and to Mr.
Bass' appointment to fill it.
Mr. Pas.* will leave he**e today

FLETCHER TELLS COMMITTEE
OF TARGET PRACTICE.
Dreadnoughts of United States Lead
World and Men are Just as Good.
Washington, March 2.-?An encour?
aging report on the condition and ef?
ficiency of the nation's sea forces was
given the house naval committee to?
day by Admiral Frank Fletcher, com
mander-in-chief of the Atlantic fleet.
In individual fighting efficiency,
Admiral Fletcher declared, the dread?
noughts of the United States led the
world, while in the skill of Its offi?
cers and men, the navy had no rea?
son to fear comparison to that of any
other power.
Describing some of the things the
navy is doing in the light of lessons
of the European war, the admiral
said one ship of the fleet recently had
hurled seven out of 42 huge projec?
tiles through a target 20 by 60 feet
I at a range of eight to nine miles, or
16,000 to 18,000 yards. The longest
ranges used in naval engagements of
the European war thus far, he ex?
plained, were' 16,000 to 17,000 yards.
Judging from reports of target
practice at Guantanamo during I the
last month, Admiral Fletcher said, it
waa probable that from 10 to 20 per
dent, of the shots fired could be land?
ed on a battleship at 18,000 yards.
I He said that inherent errors in gun
'ire and range determination, which
do not seriously affect results at short
distances, are greatly magnified as
the rangjR goes up.
To bring out the effectiveness of
navy shells, Admiral Fletcher tpld of
' target work by the Wyoming last year
at 12,000 yards in which three shells
penetrated a 10 inch armor plate.
Five out of 30 shots fired, he said,
struck the small target and from 80
? to 90 per cent.'wouid have landed on
-a battleship.
? ? The committee will take up tomor?
row the bill to authorize officers of
?the marine corps to accept employ?
ment in the Haltten constabulary.
Col. Waller, commanding the marines
? in Haiti, told the committee that ?.b
^a*i\ew revot?lw^coxnU hol be orgtcn
ised,' as the natives were enjoying
peace and security for the first timo
in 112 years. They were completely
satisfied, he said, and within three
? years the constabularly probably
could be turned over to native offi?
cers and the entire American force,
with the cxcoption of a small legation
guard, be withdrawn.
URGES PEACE WITH AMERICA.
German Papers Point to Dangers to
Germany in Case of War With Unit?
ed States.
Berlin, March 4.?Conservative Ger?
man papers' today ?warned v Germany
of the dangers of a war with the
United States, pointing out what it
would mean to have the resources of
America added to those of the Al?
lies. Herr Naumand, a member of
the Reichstag, writing in the Schles?
wig papers says that an American
fleet would be placed side by side wtdi
Britain's, increasing the posisbility of
an absolutely effective blockade and
that a formidable army could be rais?
ed In the United States in aix months.
America could finance the Allies for
an unlimited period. The article ends
with the statement: "We cannot shut
our eye to the endless sacrifices
war with the United States would de?
mand."

Federal Reserve Besides.
Washington, March 2.?Final deci?
sion was reached by the house mili?
tary committee late tcday upon its
bill for the increase of the army, and
it will be reported unanimously to the
house early next week. In rov*nd
figures the measure would authorize
the formatior an army composed
of regulars, ? onal Guardsmen and

summe fining camp idea. It is es?
timate at 100,000 men can be en?
rolled the hitter force.
The bill retains provision for ?or?
ganization of industrial and technical
reserves, and authorizes creation of a
board of officers to control an indus?
trial mobilization in time of war or
Imminence of war. It also provides
that manufacturers of war materials
must give immediate preference to
government orders in war time, or
when there is danger of war, ander
heavy penalty for failure to do so.
While the minimum strength of the
regular army remained at 140,000 m
change was made before the fite
vote to fix the maximum of fighti'**'
troops at 170,000, bringing the total
authorized strength of the regular
force, including the hospital corps
and other noncombatant troops, to
190,000.
Although all members of the com*'
mlttee will sign the bill they do so
under the reservation that^ they may
support upon the floor of .the house
any amendment they desire.
The senate military committee ex?
pects to vote finally upon Its army
bill tomorrow, and it is possible the\
placed before both houses cf coi
Saturday. Arrangements to expedltel
