Rumored That German Navy Is
About to Engage British in
North Sea.
London, March 7.—Driving hard
against the French lines northwest
and southeast of Verdun, the Ger­
mans have been enaDled to make ad­
ditional gains toward Verdun, but
with extreme heavy casualties, ac­
cording to Paris. Hill No. 265 to the
southeast, and a portion of Corbeaux
Wood, directly south of Forges, have
been occupied by the Germans
through strong infantry attacks that
were preceded by extremely heavy
bombardments.
The town of Fresnes in the Woevre
also has been captured.
Over Entire Front.
The German attack was over the
entire front west of the Meuse, ex­
tending from Bethincourt to the river
but, except in the Corbeaux Wood,
the French held back the attackers at
all points. Thus (he French occupy
the strategic positions on the heights
of Coie de 1'Oie, for the possession or
which numerous sanguinary engage
men is have been fought.
Advance Three Miles.
The occupation of a portion of the
Corbeaux Wood would indicate that
the Germans have advanced over
three miles since they took the town
of Forges.
The recapture by the Germans of
a position from the iFrench in Cham­
pagne, the pushing of the German
lines farther forward in the Argone
forests,and the. expulsion1 of ^sfnfnll
British detachments from capture
German trenches northeast of Ver

man official reports.
Expect Naval Battle.
Despite reports from Rome that 20
German dreadnaughts have come in­
to the North Sea from their base at
Kiel, and other reports which seem
to presage the imminence of a naval
battle, nothing definite has come
through to show that German war­
ships are out-maneuvering or seeking
battle.
ENGLAND REPLIES
TO GERMANY'S NOTE
ON BARALONG CASE
London, March 7.—The British re
.ply to the German note sent through
the 'American embassy at Berlin in
the middle of January, rejecting the
British government's offer for an in
vestigation of the Baralong case, by
a court "composed of American naval
officers, and announcing Germanq's
in tention to adopt measures of re­
prisals, was issued tonight. It is for
transmission to Ambassador Gerard
at Berlin, through Walter Hines
Page, American ambassador ^at Lon­
don.
The Baralong, a British patrol boat,
last fall sank a German submarine
and allegations were made that men
from the 'Baralong afterwards killed
members of the German submarine
crew while they were in the water
or on board the American steamer,
Nicosian, which had picked them up.
The British government disclaims
any intention to further discuss its
jgeneral charges of the inhumanity of
Germany's sea warfare, which it holds
have been amply proved.
GERMAN GENERAL

the part of Greater Bulgaria.
GERMAN STEAMERS SEIZED.
Lisbon, March 7.—Four German

London, March 7.—The Swedish

evil which so many people covet, has

New York, March 7.—The deten­
tion of the steamship, Stockholm, o?
the recently organized Swedish Am­
erican line by British authorities on
her last outward voyage from this
port served to create in Sweden a
pronounced German feeling, accord­
ing to Mr. Zvinn, a New York im­
porter, who arrived her today on the
Stockholm, on her second trip since
she was purchased by her present
owners.
"Prior to the holding up of the
Stockholm," said Mr. Zvinn, "the syni
pahty as between Germany arid Eng­
land appeared to ba about evenly di­
vided. The Stockholm, while owned
by a private corporation, is looked up­
on by the Swedish people as a na­
tional institution and the line that
owns her as a forerunner of a great
commercial sea power for the coun­
try. Her detention for more than a
week was taken as an affront."
Mr. Zvinn also said that there ar,e
millions of dollars worth of merchan­
dise waiting in Gothenburg for ship­
ment to the United States, but held
owing to the lack of ships.

Treadwell Twichell, Back From
E^tj' lJecta^eS 'Colonel Is
Gaining.
Fargo, N. 'D„ .March 7.—"Roosevelt
seems to be coining back."
That is the predominant: thought
among politicians of the east and it
is the opinion thai, is expressed both
by them and business men generally.
Treadwell Twichell, former speaker
of the house of representatives of
North Dakota, who returned to Fargo
recently from an extensive east­
ern trip, brings the foregoing view
of the political line-up.
"The republicans of the east—and
1 mean the men who are doing things
in the parly in connection with the
national situation—are coming to re­
alize more aiul more the fact that
they cannot elect any man who is not
satisfactory to Colonel Roosevelt.
"Recognition of that fact has cen­
tered attention upon .Mr. Roosevelt
himself and is responsible for the
current opinion. 'Uoosevelt seems to
be coming back.'
"United States Senator A. 11. Cum­
mins of Iowa might have a chance,
for it is though' in some quarters
that he might he acceptable to Roose­
velt. The name of Senator Burton
of Ohio is also frequently mentioned.
"As for Weeks of Massachusetts,
or Fairbanks, they are given little
consideration—the Fairbanks boom
being looked upon as a joke."
Mr. Twichell. during his visit in
Washington, gained the impression
that Wilson stands in a far worse
position with respect to his own par­
ty than did Taft. with the republi­
cans. His attitude on many prob­
lems has been responsible, says Mr.
Twichell, for a split within the demo­
cratic party and the breach is rapidly
widening.
During his visit in Washington, Mr.
Twichell spent some time in consid­
eration, with congressional commit­
tees, of the administration rural cred­
its bill, popularly known as the iMoss
Cullis bill. With amendments that
have been made, providing for han­
dling delinquent loans, etc., the bill
has assumed more acceptable form,
although there still is much to be
wished.
Capture Two

Washington, March 7.—'Capture of

dispatches from Pekin.
The legation said government
troops have retaken Poyai, "the most
important strategic point on the bor­
der of Yunnan," and "Sui Chow, an­
other important place in the south­
west of Szechuan."
In the engagement several thous­
and rebels were killed.

OPPOSES RECALL OF
of War.
Lond'on, March 7.—Winston Spen­
cer Churchill, former first lord of the
admiralty, now a colonel and fresh
from the trenches, sprang into the
parliament arena today in a daring
speech, answering First Lord of the
Admiralty Balfour, who had just pre­
sented the naval estimate, and de­
claring that the admiralty lacks driv­
ing force and must be revitalized be­
fore it is too late, by bringing back
Lord Fisher, the former first sea lord,
to head the admiralty administration.
Great, interest attached to Col.
Churchill's reappearance, after a pe­
riod of silence while serving with
the army. The naval policy inaugu­
rated at the opening of the war has
undergone considerable change.
(Mr. lE'alfour had just concluded an
optimistic statement of the naval out­
look, which strongly appealed to tho
patriotic house of commons, so that.
Col. Churchill's criticisms were cohllv
received. But he gradually gathered
attention and applause until he clos­
ed amid scenes of enthusiasmtl
Col. Churchill predicted that since
the outbreak tho war, the German
navy would lie found to have been
greatly augmented and he expressed
the houe that the British program
of construction had been carried out
to the full requirement. He clenrl.v
intimated, however, that it had not
been.
iMr. Balfour stated that the tonnage
of the British navy had been increas­
ed by l,(kiO,MiO. of
the war, while the strength of the air
division of the navy bad grown leu
fold.
Mr. Churchill referred to his
(Churchill's) remarks as "a jarring
note and warning," which he said had
to be given. Since lie returned from
the front, he had received informa­
tion which was not entirely satisfac­
tory concerning the progress of naval
(ionstruciion.
Details must, necessarily be avoid­
ed, but it could he said that, if every
capital ship provided for in the naval
program had been completed the
navy would be ready with an ample
margin of safety.

preventing approach by the volunteer
fire fighters.
Efforts are bing made to increase
the forces combating the spread of
the fire, as it is feared the to.vn of
Ashland and the big Tiiz/el ranch
may be destroyed.
A prairie fire that devastated thou­

Resolution Tabled.
The celebrated McLemore resolu­
tion .around which the anti-adminis
(ration forces centered their fight,
was tabled, in other words killed, just
as was the Core resolution for a sipii
lar purpose in the senate last weekf^
From the very outset, of
today, the president aupportiml'l
out regard to parties, led «rcr tbt/
position. -.-.••*_
On tlie "first vote,'
Iiamentary proposition
opening the McLemore rliblunbn
amendment and unlimited Qebaie, this-'
administration forces carried tbe day,
256 to 160.
On that, 1!)2 democrats, 63 republf«
cans and one progressives voted to
support the administration. Twenty-'*
one democrats, 132 republicans, flvel
progressives and one independent^
and Representative Luden, the lone'
socialist of the house, voted against'
it.
Victory In Hand.
This was the crucial vote of the
Tight, the one point on which admin*
istration leaders were uncertain.
With victory in hand, they moved on
the next proposition, the adoption of
a special rule for discussion of the
McLemore resolution.
Again, they carried the day, this
lime 271 to 138, and then pushed their
victory to a conclusion by tabling tho
McLemore resolution, 276 to 142.
In seven hours of tense, turbulent:
session, in which the administration
opponents charged that the president
was contending for a doubtful right
and was shifting the responsibility of
diplomatic negotiations to congress,
the house swayed back and forth in
the most sensational congressional S
spectacle for a decade, probably since
the declaration of war on Spain.
Wilson Heart Returns.
President Wilson, calm and confi­
dent, heard the early results of the
voting in the cabinet room at th©
White House with some of the cabi­
net grouped about him. He told
them he was much gratified with the
support of congress.
Released from the bonds of embar­
rassment forced upon him by the dis
sention in congress, which has been
represented in foreign capitals as in
dilating that he was making bis de
mands on Germany in direct opposi-1^
tion to the sentiment of the elected f|:
representatives of the people, Presf
dent Wilson now stailds prepared to i|
go on with the submarine
tions with the Central pov

The next step probably will be

settle the Lusitania case in which
the United States probably will ask
for such further assurances as it eon
