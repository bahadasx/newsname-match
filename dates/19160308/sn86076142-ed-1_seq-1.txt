DEFINES POSITION
England is Said to Have Taken
Advantage of American
Contention
(By Associated Press.) ,
WASHINGTON, Mar. 8. Count Von Bemstoff's Instructions from Ger
many were handed today to Secretary Landing in the form of a memorandum
explaining the German position regarding armed ships and the causes lead
ing to a decision by the central powers to torpedo without warning armed
merchantmen.
It is understood that it contains the allegation that England has taken
advantage of the contention of the United States that Americans must be
safe on a defensively armed merchantman to have those ships act offensively
toward the enemy Bubmersibles. Germany Is understood to have expressed
Its willingness to operate Its submarines In accordance with the international
law prior to the war, provided that Great Britain does not violate the same
laws.

miles of frontier they had lo patrol
many of the smugglers were able to

said, would fit them for all the-higher
reaches of diplomacy.

rels of mussels, balls of rubber Inside
the outer shells of onions and bags
of meal got up to represent sleeping
babies were sent over tin border.
Hundreds of thousands of the frontier
population after the Beginning of the

the proscribed traffic. Bribery of the
frontier guard Is said to have been
the method tried most frequently.
The strip of country along the var

manders order the whole lief of the
community. They have reported in

A bill passed recently limits sup

The authorities enrry out the ant
smuggling laws in a most drastic
way, realizing that the traffic was en
