Best This Year.
To the thinking:, reading: wide
awake farmer, there can be only
one sensible course to follow in
1916, and that is, first of all, to
feed his family, his livestock and
his land, and then devote his
surplus lands and energies to the
production of whatever cash
crop may be best suited to his
particular con ditions.
Of course, as in the past, there
are going to de thausands of tenont
larmnrc n1/\nnr nniVi
mui ?u&auvtaii/u^ mill v/uicia
who, by reason of their methods,
are on the straight road to tenancy,
who will put everything in
cotton, tobacco, or some other
single crop, depending on it to
furnish the money to pav for
food, feed and fertilizers; bu t this
is all the more reason why the
thinking farmer, the man who is
getting ahead by using his head
should make living at home his
primary business.
Cotton now is bringing only
fair prices; the price is tending
dounward instead of upward,
and there is no definite assurance
that prices will be high
next fall. But whether prices
are high or low is aside from the
main point; for even were cotton
selling at twentv cents a nnnnH
we hold that no man can afford
to gro& it to the exclusion of
food, feed and soil-building crop;
grow it to buy bread, meat, molasses,
corn, oats, hay and fertilizers.
Let's get right on this question,
Brother. Let's make a good
living, whether we make any
cotton or tobacco or not. The
following are, it seems to us,
points that every fanner in the
whole South should in tke it his
business to see to, and to see to
now.

corn from Iowa and $25
Western hay will break any coilon
farmer.
We can raise these crops at
home at from one-third to onehalf
the store prices, and improve
our lands at the same time
Now is the time to plan a big
corn acreage?amply sufficient
to supply your home needs, with
a surplus to spare; now is the
time to plan to put velvet beans,
soy beans, cowpeas, or peanuts
in all the corn nnH tlw> r?ote

2. Cut out the meat and bread
bills. Plenty of corn, peanuts
peas and beans usually mean 1
plenty of meat, milk and butter;
these produced on the farm, in (
turn, mean cotton money to go 1
in the bank instead of into the 1
pocket of the "time prices" mer- 1
chant. 1
3. Cut down the fertilizer hills 1
. For 75 per cent of the farmers of j
the South, a really good syylem
of rotation farming, a system
that would include the planting
of peas, beans, or some other
legume in every field of corn j
aud alter every acie of oats; a
crop of crimson clover to plow
under for every acre of corn to
be planted; and a crop of green
on every single acre every winter,
would enable us to cut out
commercial nitrogen and potash,
leaving only phosphoric acid lo

chasm in rock phosphate at only
a 1 taction of the cost in acid
phosphate. In oilier words,
living at home and farming as
we should will enable us to cut
our fertilizer bills anywhere
from 50 to 80 or 90 per cent.
Let's try these plans this year.

straight road toward rich land,

"Inclosed please find a specimen
of one of the early spring
flies, caught January 22, 1916.
About how many less flies will
there be later in the spring by
the destruction of this one?"
writes A. J. L.
Let us assume that this fly
was a female and that the sea
son will be about normal, that
all conditions for fly life will be
perfect, and that every female
hatched will live to full maturity
and lay her full quota of eggs.
She would begin laying about
April and her daughters would
have been ready to lay about
May 1. The females of the second
crop would lay in May and
their young would be ready to
lay about June 1, After that we
figure that to pass through the
stage?egg, larvae, pupa, fly to
fly, ready to lay, would require
24 days. This would mean five
crops by October 1.
The calculated number of descendants
of this old lady on Oc
looer 1 next would be 131 quin- 1
tillions, 220 quadrillions or 4
131,220,000,000,000,000,000. 1
Hewitt says: "It has been calculated
that if the progeny of a \
single pair of flies, assuming that 1
they all lived, were pressed together
at the end of the summer 1
they would occupy a space of 1
about 250,000 cubic feet." 5
Would you care to know their J
weight? 1
The North Carolina Bulletin \
warns the people of that State 1
to kill the winter flies. There 5
were fewer flies in North Caro- '
lina in the summer of 1915 and
?h:? <1./. *"?- ? - 4

believes to be due to the active *
campaign "against the winter }
fly, and to the vigilance of the \
tidy housewife in cleaning up
and destroying the 'holdover' in '
the spring." (
Now is the lime to swat every 1
fly in sight. Ycu can be ex- *
cused for failing to swat every 1
fly in summer. Swatting Hies 1
in a flyful place is an endless, 1
hopeless task. One fly in August
left alone may not breed {
more than 1,000. Swatting every '
nv tnat shows at this season is (
an easy task. No one can af ]
ford to neglect them. One left 1
alive means quintillions, cubic t
feet, tons of flies, before the season
has ended. (
Says The North Carolina Bui (
letin: "Con't trust the cold to *
kill them. Don't assume that *
they are dead when you find '

sills in unused rooms. They are s
playing possum and will re c
cover when the temperature '
rises. Clean up the house and f
eive special attention to every N
out of the way place where flies s
may lurk. Make sure that there
is nothing left which may har- ^
t)or their eggs."?Dr. W. A.

German Sacrifices For Douau- 1
mont Greatest Yet
Paris, March 4.?The fire of s
French machine guns and rifles 1
las been pouring death for two *
iays into the ranks of the Ger- \
nans attacking in mass the vil
age of Douaumont. The French (
aold the summit of the knoll i
which dominates the village t
From the south. Parts of the ,
town have been taken and re- ,
taken repeatedly, and each time (
ll A. it / - ' * - *
luui me ionune 01 oattle lias ,
chanced more dead from the ,
thick masses of German assail- j
ants have been added to the piles ,
behind which their surviving (
comrades have sought brief pro- ,
tection. .
Each time remnants of regi- ,
ments already cut to pieces were ,
pushed ahead by other bodies of '
troops surging ou the field of ,
battle until the ground was .
strewn with bodies. Eyewit- ,
esses assert that nothing at
Charlerol, on the Marne, along ,
the Yser, or in the Champagne ,
equalled the sacrifices which the ,
troops of the German Crown \
Prince already have made for ;
the village of Douaumont alone
in the battle of Verdun.
It is the opinion in all quarters ,
that the Crown Prince has de- ,
termined to pav the price neces- <
aary to capture Verdun, if pos- ,
sible, drive the French from the ,
right bank of the Meuse, and ]
establish a front along that river j
if he is unable to pierce the lines 1
and open ud the way to Chalons ,
and Paris. ^
All information thus far re- j
:eived indicates that the Ger
nans already have paid a very |
leaw pnce and that Verdun it- ,
self has not yet been shaken. ,
The ultimate cost of the drive is (
problematical. Paris remains j
:onfident thai tlie Germans will j
;ind it impossible to achieve ,
iventual success. This feeling ,
las been made still more pro j
lounced by the recitals of the ,
<
wounded and of German soldiers. {
French infantry is disputing t
ivery inch of the ground with '
persistent courage, and last night t
pnce more compelled their ad- j
/ersaries to suspend efforts, leav ^
ng artillery alone to keep up t
he pressure on the fortress.
Whenever the German assault ,
>n the French lines reached the J
langer point, the blue clad ,
roops leaped forward with fixed ^
>ayonets to the strains of the ,
National battle hymn. Accounts j
)f this fighting from French
iources say that on each oc- j
:asion the slodiers of the Repub ^
ic got the better of their op- r
jonents, pushing back Germans
vho did not fall under the cold
it eel.

Mr. Sam Mangum Dies Suddenly T
. Mr. Sam Mangum, youngest
ton of Mr. and Mrs. John C. >
Mangum, died suddenly about c
1.30 o'clock Saturday night at t
he home of Mr. George C.
smith 2 miles north of town,
rhis young man had about re- s
covered from a recent attack of c
grippe and had been at work at i
the Mangum Drug company's [
store on Saturday. He had felt t
a pain about his heart for three
or four davs but little thought
was given it. He was at a
social gathering of young people
at Mr. Smith's when the
summons came. He was apparently
well, and was charting
with his companions when he
fell backward without a word
and was dead. The news was a
great shock to the entire community.
It was hard to realize
that one who had been seen so
recently in health had passed
away.
Mr. Mangum was a member
of Pageland Baptist church, and
was and upright young man,
sober and honest. He is spoken
of in high terms by all. He was
21 years old the 30th day of last
July.
His death was all the more J
sad because he was engaged and
was to have been married on
Wednesday, March 15th. His 1
wedding suit had been bought, c
ind in this his body was buried 1
[n the morning of life when ?
aopes and ambitions were high, l,
the Reaper came and called him
without warning to his reward,
thus bringing great sorrow to F
lis loved ones 1
The funeral was conducted at 1

Newspaper a Cammunity Asset
Under the above caption the
Wilmington Star a few days ago
:arried an excellent editorial seting
forth the real worth of a
tewspaper to a town or city and
howing that no town or city
ran hope to forge ahead unless
t has a newspaper and unless
t's citizens co operate in making
he paper a success.
The remarks of the Star were
jrought about by the action of
he Chamber of Commerce in a
rertain Southern city in enumeriting
the various enterprises of
hat town and totally ignoring
VlO fuift
V >iiu ieprcscning
an approximate cash value
>f half a million dollars and cmiloying
several score of men
vho helped in making the town
i good place in which to live.
Newspaper people rarely like
o sing their own praise. It
;hould be unnecessary for them
o do so. The citizens of any
own or city in which there is a
lewspaper should realize what a
H"eat factor it is in the developnent
and promotion of their city
ind boost it as much as possible
vithout being prompted every
ew days.
Without a newspaper, a good
lewspaper, any town is handi:apped.
It has no way of let
ing the world know what it is
loihg and consequently, is
dentical with the merchant who
loes not advertise his wares.
It might be said that a ncws>aper
is worth more to a municpality
than other one of it's enerprisesand
every citizen should
ake a pride in it and help to
nake it representative' of the

The Significance of Bible Numbers
Rev. Junius Ilorton, who is
well known here and who is
uuw a siuuenr in uic Union
Theological Semninarv at Richmond,
Va., writes the Journal as
follows:
"I have been studying Bible
numbers in mv course here and
thought that the readers of the
"Pageland Journal" would be
interested in them.
' "Three denotes Deity. We
find the Trinity of the Godhead
expressed in the Baptismal
formula and in the \postolic
benediction.
"Four is considered the world
number. The Bible speaks of
the four winds, the four living
creatures, the four seasons and
the four corners of the earth.
"Seven is the number of Reve
ranon. 111 tue book of the Revelation,
we find the letters to the
seven churches, the seven seals,
the seven trumpets the seven
mystic figures, and the seven
vials. 7, is a covenant cumber
and used to denote completeness.
"Ten is the basic number,symbolizing
harmony. In the Tabernacle,
the Holy of Holies was
10 by 10 by 10 cubits.
-l. ? '
a weivu is me numuer 01 completeness,
the Divine number 3,
times the human number 4. It
is also a covenant number, and
is used in the Bible as follows:
the 12 tribes, the 12 Patriarchs,
the 12 Apostles, the 12 gates of
the New Jerusalem.
"One hundred and forty-four
is twelve times twelve, and
stands for fcompleteness times
completeness or absolute completeness.
John on the isle of ,
Patmos saw the hundred and
forty four thousand."
British Orders to Merchantmen
London, March 2.?The British
Admiralty tonight officially
made public the Admiralty's
orders to armed merchantmen,
given October 20, 1915. The
orders say that the armament of
such vessels must be used solely
for resisting an attack by an armed
vessel and for no other purpose.
As British submarines and
aircraft are ordered not to ap
proach merchantmen, the orders
say, the approach to a British
merchantman of a submarine is
to be regarded as done with a
hostile intention.
The official statement reads as
follows:
*4In view of the recent issue
by the German Government of a
memorandum on the treatment
of armed merchant ships, the
Admiralty has decided to make
public the instructions actually
governing: the actions of British
merchant vessels armed for selfiefeiise.

cautious Keporter
"Young man," said the editor
to the new reporter, "vou lack
caution. You must lealn never
to state a thing as a fact until it
has been proved a fact. You
lire apt to get us into libel suits.
Do not say: ' The cashier stole
the funds.' Say: ' The cashier,
who is alleged to have stolen
the lunds.' That's all. Oh, get
something about that First Ward
social lonitrbt "
The next day, half way down
the social column, the editor saw
[lie following cautious paragraph:
"It is rumored that a card
jarty was given last evening by
i number of reputed ladies of
he First Ward. Mrs. Smith,
gossip says, was the hostess, and
he festivities are reported to
lave continued until 11:30 in
he evening. The alleged hostvss
is believed to he the wife of
ohn Smith, the so railed 'high>riced
trrocer."
