Washington, March 8.—Count von
BwnitorS, the German ambassador, to
day at the Instruction of his govern
ment handed to Secretary Lansing a
long memorandum explaining In detail
tlje German position in regard to armed
merchant ships and the causes leading
up to /he decision to torpedo without
warning all armed merchantmen ~of the
enemy.
Secretary Lansing and Count yon
Beraatorff declined to divulge its con
tents. It is understood to contain the
allegation that-Great Britain had taken
advantage of the contention of the
Vnited States that Americans must be

Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the British am
bassador.
The memorandum Js also understood
to reiterate the previous declarations
that -submarine warfare was begun by
Germany in reprisal for the announced
intention of Great Britain to starve the
civilian populatioh of the -central em
pires.
The memorandum Js also understood
to refer to the long-standing friendship

American people will, when familiar
with th6 explanation, fuHy appreciate
the position in. which Germany finds
herself as a result of the blockade.
Says Reprisals Are Justified.
^By way of supporting the'contention
that Germany's reprisals are Justified
tfee memorandum Is said to enumerate
various actions of Great Britain'which
are said,to have.operated.against neu
trals and their citizens. These are
cited to show that Great Britain has
violated international law.
It is pointed out that Germany agreed
to abide by certain terms of the dec
laration oflondon, but that Inasmuch
its Oreat Britain has not restrained her
actions to conform wtih the terms of
the declaration, Germany can not be
expected to agree to operate under a
v£ode
which Great Britain disregards.

"Washlngrton/ March -8.—The text of
the' memorandum presented by Count
yon Bemstortt to Secretary Lansing
today fellows:
"The imperial German govern
ment, on account of the friendly
relations which haver always ex
isted between the two great na
tions, and earnestly desiring to
continue them, wishes, to explain
the U-boat question once more to
the American government.
"At the outbreak of the war, the
German government immediately
expressed its readiness to ratify
the declaration of Iiondon. At
that time a German prise code al
ready had been issued which was
entirely based upon the rales of
the declaration of London
"Germany thereby proved her
willingness .to recognise ftplly the
existing rules o)f international law,
which Insure the freedom of the
seas for the trade of neutral na
tions, not only among themselves
but also with belligerent countries.
"Great Britain on the other hand
declined to ratify the declaration
of London and after ^the outbreak
of the war began to restrict the
legitimate trade of the neutrals In
order to hit Germany. The contra
band provisions, were systemati
cally extended on 'Aug. 5 and 20,,
Sept. 21, and Oct. 29, .1914. On
Nov. 3, 1914. the order of the
British admiralty followed, de
claring the whole North sea a war
zone in whieh commercial shipping
would be exposed to the most
serious danger from mines and
men of war Protests from neu
trals were of no avail., j^nd from
that time or. the freedom of neu
tral commerce with Germany was
practically destroyed. Under these
circumstances Germany was com
pelled to resort to reprisals.
"The use of the submarine nat
urally necessitated a restriction of
free movement of neutrals and
constituted a danger for them
which Germany intended to warn
off by a special yarning analogous
to the -jwfrning England had given
regarding the North sea.

In her note of Feb. 17 and Great
Britain in those of Feb. 18 and 20,
