REPUBLICAN VOTERS DID IT
Rally Cry was "Down with the Kaiser"
and Party Lines Cut No
Figure.
i .Washington, March 8, President
Wilson yesterday completely and dec!
sivelywon hiB long and sensational
fight' to compel Congress to aeunow
ledge that it stands behind him in tbe
submarine negotiations with Germany.
To' the "rallying cries of "Stand by the
president'' and "It is Lansing and Wjl
son or-Von liernstorl! and the kaiser,'
a big-democratic majority and nearly
half of the republicans in the House
three times rolled up overwhelming
votes against the movement to warn
Americans off the armed ships ot the
European belligerents.
The celebrated McLemore resolution,
around which the administration forces
"centered their fight, wus tabled, in oth
er words, killed. Just as was the Gore
resolution for a similar purpose in the
Senate last week.
On the first vote, which was a par
liamentary proposition to prevent open
ing the McLemore resolution to amend
ment and unlimited debate, the admin
istration forces carried the day, 256 to
1G0. On that 192 democrats, 63 repub
licans and one progressive voted to
support the administration. Twenty
ono democrats, 132 republicans, five
progressives, one independent and Re
presentative London, the lone socialist
of the House, voted against it.

The former course is taken by vessels
bound for New York, the lutter by ves

VERMONT REJECTS
1 3.580 MAJORITY: PRIMARY V
Astonishing Endorsement of Local Option Sur
prises Even Its Warmest Supporters Pri-
mary Law Carried Ten Counties and i
Has Majority of 342923 j -
Licensed Towns
Vermont emphatically sustained lo
cal option and kicked prohfbitlon
down the back stairs yesterday by a
majority of over 13,000 in a total vote
of about 60,000.
All over the gtate many country
roads were blocked and the result was
a 6raall vote. The majority against
prohibition would have been many
thousand larger had the farmers been
able to get out for the astonishing
thing about the election was the way
the rural dry towns swatted the
Perry bill.
Only one county in the state'' went
for prohibtion, Orleans, and that only
by 397, whereaB iu 1903 Orleans gave
a prohibition majority of 2117 in a
total vote of 3531. Windham, Orange,
Windsor, Lamoille, Grand Isle, Essex
and Caledonia which gave strong ma
jorities for prohibition in 1903 were
even more emphatic for local option
yesterday.
These prohibition counties alone
would have killed the Perry bill with
Bennington, Rutland, Chittenden and
Washington counties left out.
Only a scattering town here and
there voted for the Perry bill. In this
county Rupert and Stamford went for
the bill. In Windham county ernon
voted for it by a majority of Ave and
Stratton by a majority of four.
Every one of the other 21 towns gave
majorities against the bill.
Brattleboro, the home of Francis E.
Perry, father of the Perry bill,
repudiated the measure by a majority
of 568. Stamford in this county where
Mr. Perry was born gave a majority
of two for the Perry bill.'
The country towns of the state have
found by the experience of the last 13
years that local option is a bettor
temperance law than prohibition. The
yearly vote under local option keeps
temperance ' sentiment active and
warns the wonld-be liquor seller, that
his town is againBt him. For this rea
son tbe country towns voted by about
two to one majorities against the
Perry bill and then turned around and
voted no license by an equally ,de
clsive majority; '
Had the cities and large towns been
cut out of voting yesterday the small
er towns would have killed the Perry
bill by a substantial majority.' Dorset,
which always votes dry, went against
the Perry bill 142 to 25 and voted no
license by 99 to 63. Arlington voted
against prohibition 167 to 40 and voted
dry 133 to 59.

The primary law was adopted by the
voters by a majority of 3429. It car
ried all the counties except Essex,
Orange, Rutland and Windham.
The primary was at a disadvantage
owing to the greater interest in tho
Perry bill. Tho primary ballot was on
tinted paper and there is no question
that its majority was materially re
duced by the confusion ovor the bal
lots. There were also many blanks,
over 100 in Bennington, and in other
towns in proportion.
Under the circumstances the suc
cess of the primary is gratifying to its
supporters. The vote of this county
on the primary was as follows:
Yes No

LEADING TOBACCO TOWN ,
Wirkton-Salem, Manufactures
Mor'
Thin Any Other Qity.
Following are extracts irom an ad
dress delivered by Col., M D. . Watts,
Collector of Internal. Revenue for the
Fifth District of North Carolina, -at a
smoker given by The Twin City Club,-
Winston-Salem, February 4tu. 1916:; if
"Winston-Salem' is . supplying one-r
fourth of all the chewing and smoking'
tobacco consumed In trie United States '
besides exporting vast quantities "to
foreign lands. This Statement Is tak-'(
en from the report of : the ' oramis
slouer of Internal Revenue for th ;
first quarter of .the present fiscal year '
and. from private advices from Wash-
Ington, as to the second quarter, which
ended December 31st, last. . ' ,
"Your city is making one-seventh. of
all tobacco - products chewing and
smoking tobacco, V cigars, cigarettes
and snufT manufactured in the United
States. Your manufacturers are pay-:
ing on an average about $37,000 a dayl
revenue taxes to the government and
the amount is increasing from month
to month. When your government
building, much the handsomest in the
State, was completed last July at a
cost of $250,000 your newspapers made
the statement that the taxes paid in
your city to Uncle Sam for the first
eight days of its occupancy would pay
for it. Since September, it has taken
only a fraction over seven average
days collections here to equal its.
cost So far this week, Mr. Cranford
has taken in $206,428.50. I predict that
before 1916 shall have ended your
average weekly payments to the gov
eminent on tobacco will-more than '
pay for this magnificent building, leav
ing the collections for the other fifty
one weeks as clear profit to the gov
ernment, i v
"Wlnstou-Salcm is shipping on an
average each week day to all parts ol
this country and to foreign lands at
least $150,000 of tobacco products.
"In conclusion, . Winston-Salertt
manufactures more tobacco, all ' to
bacco products are taken into this
statement, than any other city on
earth, little or big. Industrially,' she
is easily first in North Carolina, popu
lation considered, first in America and
I believe, in the world; socially a
never failing delight to her friends."
