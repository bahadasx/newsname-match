j (!erman' Ambassador Heni-
storll at the instruction ot his
government, today handed to
Seiri'laiy Lansing a long mem
orandum explaining in detail
the German position in regard
! to armed merchant ships, anil
the causes leading to the deci
ision of the Central Powers to
torpedo without warning all
armed merchantmen of their
enemies.
The contents of the memo
randum is tindivtilged, but it is
understood to contain the alle
gation that Great Britain took
advantage of the United States'
position that Americans must
lie safe on defensively armed
merchantmen, to have those
ships act offensively toward her
'enemies' submarines.
Germany concedes, it is un
derstood, that the present in
ternational law makes no pro
vision for the use of subma-
irines, as they are new, but that
she will operate according to
the law before the war, provid
ing England does the same.
