BANK PASSES MILLION
MARK IN BUSINESS
Kandiyohi County Bank Regis
tered Resources Over One
Million Last Saturday.
The Kandiyohi County Bank broke
into the Million Dollar Class last Fri
day when its total xesources exceeded
this h^ure several thousand dollars
This is another milestone in the
bank's growth and is a source of grat
ification to the bank officers as it in
dicates the measure ot confidence with
which the institution is regarded by
the community. Furthermore it is an
indication of the growth of our city
and surrounding country.
The totals were swelled by the un
usual amount ot money deposited the
hrst part of March, awaiting land in
vestments, which are usually conclud
ed on this date, and while it is expect
ed that the totals will recede from this
high mark, vet it is a sate guess that
the bank will soon be in the Million
Dollar Class permanently The state
ment for March 4 follows:
Loans and discounts S47.385 77
Overdratts 220 42
Bond® and stocks 164 69

FAMOUS PHOTOPLAY AT
MAJESTIC THIS WEEK
be
"The Battle Cry of Peace," to
Shown Thursday and Friday.
"The Battle Cry of Peace," which
will be shown Thursday and Friday at
the Majestic theatre, is a picture
which every person should see. All
may not agree with the principles
which prompted the making of the
film, but the wonderful scenes, the
great lessons taught, and the possi
bility of such an invasion by a foreign
country are well worth the price to
everyone.
War is the theme of the picture
war, not at wireless and cable range,
but well within the corporate limits of
New York City.
There are thrills by the yard, hor
rors slowly drawn out inch by inch
and not a few feet of good comedy.
The achievements of the camera are
remarkable. The company which was
employed in making "The Battle Cry
of Peace" must have left a devastated
region behind it like Belgium in the
path of the Germans. A train is wreck
ed merely to point a passing argument
for the hero, and building after build
ing goes down under heavy gunfire or
bombs from the sky.
Enormous crowds' are employed in
the scenes of panic and big masses of
troops pictured as they charge in the
face of shrapnel. There is also a large
scale naval battle and some decidedly
interesting views showing the man
oeuvring of submarines.
In particular peace rests en the
home of the Vandergriffs, for the head
of that family is an advocate of dis
armament. An enemy spy urges him
on in the work. John Harrison, who
loves Virginia Vandergriff, is an advo
cate of preparation, but his words are
little heeded and the dread day comes
when there are no box scores on the
first page of the evening papers, but
only war in Cheltenham type of about
200 point.

TALENTED MUSICIANS TO
APPEAR IN RECITAL
Miss Ina Brynilsen to Give Recital
Assisted by Vocalists of Note.
The Piano Recital which was an
nounced to take place at the Masonic
Temple Tuesday evening has been
postponed until the following evening,
Wednesday, March 15, due to conflict
with several other entertainments.
The recital should prove a pleasant
evening's entertainment to musical
lovers of Willmar. Care has been
taken to relieve the tension of the
program by a liberal interspersing of
vocal numbers by Ethel Merriam
Wakefield of lyceum fame and Henry
Albrecht, a local favorite of the past
year.
Miss Brynilsen is a musician of un
usual talent. A graduate of the Min
neapolis School of Music and Dram
atic Art in 1910, she has also spent
two years in Washington, D. C, un
der graduates of New England and

The frolicksome carnival spirit is
shown in The Clown, where the har
lequin leads the procession, dressed
in a fantastic costume of many col
ors, performing antics for the amuse
ment of the bystanders. At times
there is an under current of sadness
and regret, revealing a bit of the
human heart beneath.
In "The Funeral March on the
Death of a Hero," the piano repro
duces an orchestral effect. In the trio
we hear the kettle drums, the ear
piercing notes of the fife, and the spir
it stirring drum. We feel the slow
relentless march of time and destiny,
and the might and majesty of Death.
"The Whispering Wind" brings to
our ears the all pervading stir and
rustle and murmur of the soft breezes,
the rushing winds among the leaves
of the forest and across the wayward
brook.
"Wedding Day," is a picture of Nor
wegian rustic festivities, where the
assembled guests march to the place
of meeting, the music growing louder
and more impetuous as they reach the
destination* The curious little inter
lude seems to be a love duet where
the voices follow each other in a dia
logue. It is a brief touch of senti
ment where the noise and the hilarity
are forgotten for the moment. Abrupt
ly the march begins again, ending
with the slowwindup with the fiddlers
tuning their strings in fifths.
"Puch" is a piece of droll music de
scribing the impish mischievous frol
ic of the hill fairies as they leap and
flit among the caverns and ragged
rocks.
In "Moonlight," we see the soft
splendor of a summer night, a canoe
drifting down the river in the witch
ery of the silver moonlight, the only
sound being the call of the night birds
and the murmur of the zephyrs.

were granted: Dr. A. W. Odell, K.
Samuelson, Hildur Hoaglund, E. E.
Lawson, O. A. Norman, E. M. Stan
ford and G. A. Erickson). President
Gilbert urged a united effort to secure
more members and thus increase the
Club's power for good.
The matter of securing better quar
ters for the club was discussed and
was referred to a committee compos
ed of G. H. Otterness, E. C. Wellin
and F. G. Handy, to act with the of
ficers of the club in making investiga
tions and to report at a future meet
ing.
It was decided that a lunch be serv
ed in April to which all are invited
for a general get-together meeting.
Rev. W. A. Rice made a talk on the
desirability of providing a place for
young men to spend their spare time,
either a Y. M. C. A. or other similar
institution. The question was discuss
ed from several angles by those pres
ent. Rev. Rice suggested to call a
general meeting of citizens some Sun
day afternoon. Messrs. Carey, of the
Majestic theatre, have promised the
use of their auditorium for this pur
pose. No definite action was taken at
last night's meeting.
F. G. Handy spoke about the condi
tion in which the roads leading to the
city had been in during the past two
months. He suggested that snow
plows be provided and concerted ac
tion be taken another winter to keep
the main roads to the city open to
traffic at all times. The matter was
recommended to the attention of the
good roads committee.

The residence on the late farm ot
Gilbert Anderson in Mature township
was totally destroyed by firs, inclos
ing all the household goods, last Sun
day evening at five o'clock. The firs
originated upstairs in some unknown
manner and had gained such, headway
when discovered, that Mr. and Mrs.
Henning Anderson, who were in at
the time, barely had time to get the
three children out when the house was
filled with smoke and flames. Another~
person in the house at the tints was
Oscar Olson. Nothing could be dons
to quench the flames, by the neigh
bors, who came to help. The family
secured shelter with Mrs. Mary HaldV
in, who lives an eighth of a mils from
the scene of the fire. The family Is
moving today to Albert Carlson's,
where they will live for the present.
The value of the burned residence
is estimated at $1,800, and was insured
in the Dovre & Mamre Insurance
Company for (1,300.
The farm was recently purchased
from Gilbert Anderson by Henning
Anderson of Triumph, Minn., who had
just taken possession, and moved in
