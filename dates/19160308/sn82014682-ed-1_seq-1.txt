the eauitv suit brought by Oelesate
Kuhio against the trustees of the Llli

tn m nrsl decision handed down in
the aupreme court today
The original uit was brought by
Kuhio, representing himself as "next

sion had to'do with a petition led by
the queen' attorney to lnhibit Cir
cuit Judge Stuart trom taking lurtner
action in the matter until so orderea
by the mpreme court.
It Is held by the aupreme court that
Kuhio Is rightly a party In the suit in
the lower court, although this was not
the contention of Judge Antonio ler-
ry, counsel for the queen. The court
further holds that any discontinuance
by the queen could not operate in so
far as the delegate being a party to
the suit is concerned.' .
On the other hand. It is held that
the nueen is not k party to the suit.
and. for this reason the writ of pro
hibition asked for by her counsel was
denied. - - .
"Sana and Competent. -
The court added in this connection
that there li a resumption that the
queen U sane and compeunt-to dis

discontinued the case as tar as her be

As tar as "the queen is concerned,
therefore, the suit is at an end. Her
counsel today stated that as she is
not a party to the actloigshe cannot
have a "next friend" or guardian-
The discontinuance by theueen
will not operate as far as the delegate
Is concerned. As the case now stands;
there is a suit still in effect with KuJ
hlo as sole plaintiff, and with the
trustees of the Llliuokalani Trust, and
others, as defendants. The supreme
court may issue a written decision
either today or tomorrow. '
Further action in the case may be
the filing of a motion for a rehearing
by counsel for the delegate.

In both instances the super visors
passed on the improvements in a way

obligates the city to pay $1500 in

at the same time the city has an offer
from a local contractor to do the job
within the estimate and save the city
more than $1700.
The second instance Kalakaua ave

this main thoroughfare and important
boulevard without sub-drainage, which
engineers declare is absolutely neces

technicalities surrounding action by
the board and j-artly from the terri

result of the developments last night,
Superintendent of Public Works
Forbes, after conferring with city fa

In a rapid fire burst of oratory punc
tuated and emphasized by quotations
of poetry that won his audience to
him, the speakers told of his impres
sions of Hawaii.
"Regardless of what his politics are,
or any other -relatively unimportant
detail, the principal thing about any
man is what kind of a heart he has."
said Mr. Walsh. 'Have you Christian
charity and u.e fountain, of brother
hood in your heart? Then you speak
the common language of brotherhood,
no matter in what part pf the world

'.'Charity, justice and brotherly love

the test of the quality of service of
