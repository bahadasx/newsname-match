rooms and where Policeman Nix

at noon. She identified James
Morgan, companion of l.indsey,
as one who had made several
visits to the gunmen's quarters.
Chief Smith httnounced that bo
bad found witnesses who declar
ed that all five of the gunmen
bad visited l.indsey at tlie 21st
street home during the last few
days.
"None of the men ln jail will
talk," said Chief Smith. "They

oldest of tbe gang, I urn certain,
knows more about this murder
than he has told."
Chief Smith has found no fur
ther inkling of the identity of
the well dressed young woman
who called on Ihe cripple three
days before the murder.
Motive a Mystery.
Police detectives who have In
vestigated the murder mystery
asserted today their belief that
l.indsey either held information
against the gunmen gang which
I hey were afraid he would di
vulge, or that he was "cashier"
for the y'eggmen living in the
21st street house antl that he was
murdered for purposes of rob

penciled memorandum. "4041|
South 21st street," the address
at which the murder occurred.

Mrs. ,1. B. 1-indsey of Grants

"This class of crooks may cone

The Tacoma Times
How a "Bum Lawyer"
Became Farm Expert
ni.owvs ii.mkv hkud ami oxk-.ukk bahn.
BY JACK JUNGMEYER
The fact that A. L. Brown is a millionaire cuts little figure
In Ihe Inspiring story of how he developed his "parcel post
fm tv" near I'.noma.
He's a fanner, first of all, competing with bis neighbors
and performing more actual work on his 'Jiiiio -, i c Nisqually
ranch than any of his hands.
Twelw years ago he ttas "a hum lawyer," as he puts 11,
in Seattle.
The country drew him like a magnet. He went out as a
greenhorn, employing a greenhorn manager.
"Because," ho explains. "I didn't want my manager to
know any more about farming than 1 did."
He borrowed the money for his ranch start, and bought.
1100 acres, mostly overflow salt swamps, with only 50 acres
under cultivation.
Today his place is a show farm of the west, antl a big
money maker.
Most of the 2GOO acres, to which it has grown, are under
intensive cultivation. There are HOO dairy cattle; SO work
horses; 1500 hogs, and 12,000 chickens.
A big creamery and a $20,000 packing bouse have been
built.
The farm activities are conducted by departments cattle,
bog, poultry, etc.—each with Its manager; and 00 men, in
spired by Farmer Brown's energy and initiative, carry on the
work.
Every Bird and Animal on Place Has to
Demonstrate Its Right to Remain There
This gigantic institution of men and machinery centers
finally on the parcel post through which now ,",0 per cent of the
products are sold, and which, Brown believes, will shortly be
the marketing medium for his entire output.
Every chicken, every cow, every pig and horse, as well as
e\ery square foot of ground, must pay its proportion of profit,
based on the amount of the total investment it represents.
And because of the system employed, Brown knows any
day in the year whether hen No. .10X1 Is making gootl and pay
ing her way, antl whether cow No- 100 7 is paying interest-on
her stable room and cost of feed.
There Is no guess work, nothing haphazard. Diversifica
tion has been brought to a science by A. 1,. Brown who 12 years
ago quit being a "bum lawyer" to become a crackerjack farmer.
Beginning with a few cattle, he found that bogs were need
ed to utilize waste products. Thousands of gallons of skim
milk today form a Mg staple in feeding 1.100 hogs.
Chickens had to come to help swell profits of the cattle
and hog departments by using up otherwise waste products.
The pennies saved thus began to mount into hundreds of
dollars.
Neighbors laughed at him, calling him the "bookkeeping
farmer.
Now "Bum Lawyer" Brown Has Come to Be
Farm Expert Whose Advice Is Sought After
But while they were sleeping or grumbling, Brown was
reading government bulletins, organizing, thinking, getting out
of the beaten ruts.
Today those neighbors sell their hogs to Brown's packing
house, and their chickens to his poultry department.
Some of them ar« little further along than they were 12
years ago when Brown's ranch was a marsh.
"System!" explained Brown. "Keeping close tab on every
animal, on every bit of feed.
By very simple bookkeeping any farmer can determine
whether or not his cows, chickens and hogs, his corn or oats
acreage, are profitable.
"Then by weeding out the poor stock, by experimenting
with cheaper feeds, by cultivating more closely, by cutting out
all the little wasteful drains that the ordinary farmer allows
to go unchecked, any energetic man can do on his own place
what we have done here."
Brown, 47, is no longer a greenhorn. Government ex
perts are watching his place carefully. His advice is eagerly
coveted. The things he is doing have a vital bearing on land
development around Tacoma and everywhere.
Further details on his system of management and their
bearing on the success of his "parcel post farm" will be cited
ln the next story.

Reported By

YOI'NGSTOVYN, 0., March S.
- The Mahoning county grand
jury today indicted Judge Elbert
Gary and other officers of six
; large steel companies on a charge
of violating the state anti-trust
I law.
Charges of conspiring to keep
j down the wages of common labor
ers also were made.
The indictments are the out

No foreign government was re
sponsible for the trouble, 'he

The guards at the plant of the
Youngstown Sheet Tube Co. pre
cipitated the riots, it is charged.
The Indictment reports that the
'evidence from 502 witnesses taken
during the month showed "law
' less condition of affairs in the
Bteel industry, indicating a dis
i regard of either rights or justice
Ito the labor classes or to the pith

One hundred and fifteen per
sons antl corporations are indicted.
"THAYKKTV," SAYS GABY
NEW YORK, March I. -Judge
Gary today termed the indict
ment against liim an outrage.
"There are no acts to justify
the indictment against the I. S.
'Steel corporation, the Carnegie
Steel Co. or any of their officers,"
he said.
"As far as I know, there are no
grounds for the indictments
against any other steel corpora-
I tions. This is an outrage, a
travesty on justice."
