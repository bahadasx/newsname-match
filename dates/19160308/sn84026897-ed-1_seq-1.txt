EDGEFIELD, S. C., WEDNESDAY, MARCH 8, 1916
MO. 5
SESSIONS COURT.
Spring Term Convened Monday.
Judge Ernest Moore Pre
siding. Ab)e Charge.
Joe Grant Case.
The spring term of court of gen
eral sessions convened Monday
morning with Hon. Ernest Moore of
Lancaster presiding. This being
the first term of the year. Judge
Moore charged the grand jury in
detail as to their obligations and du
ties. In stressing the importance of
the office of grand juror, Judge
Moore said:
"No man or body of men in any
county of the state has been en
trusted with duties for the general
public welfare more important than
those which devolve upon you as
the grand jurors of Edgefield coun
ty. Recognizing the importance of
the office, the laws of this state as
to the selection of members of your
* panel have been framed with the
view and purpose of insuring the
choice of the most fit, competent
and representative men of the coun
ty to serve as grand jurors. Peing
so chosen and recalling the oath of
office which you have taken, the
public may well rest assured in the
belief and confidence that you will
discharge the important duties of
your office to the best of your abil
ity and without fear or foe of favor
towards friends."
In urging a faithful performance
of duty, Judge Moore said:
"Upon the faithful performance
of their duties' by the grand and
petit jurors of this court depends in
large meagre the effective educa
tion of the general public in a
proper respect for law and order,
and by the due fulfillment of their
duties by each and every officer of
-this court, the advancement of the
people in a due and proper observ
ance of legal rights will be greatly
^prosooied. It is, therefore, of the
utmost consequence to the public in
terest that you, as well as all the
other officers of this court, shall
zealously strive to discharge the full
measure of your sworn duties, re
calling the solemn obligation rest
ing upon each one of you to meas- j
ure equal and exact justice to all j
men, irrespective of any other con-j
bideration by which it may bel
sought to influence your determina
tion."
Judge Moore charged that it is I
the duty of the grand jury to look j
into the record of every county ofti- j
cial and see that all public funds
are wisely expended. They are to
look after all public institutions
and see that they are properly con
ducted. In urging grand jurors to
be on the alert for violators of the
law, Judge Moore referred especial
ly to the prohibition law and the
law against, the carrying of deadly
weapons. He also urged the en
forcement of compulsory education
in the school districts that voted for
compulsory school attendance. He
said the deplorable illiteracy that
now prevails is a fruitful source of
crime.
Judge Moore pointed out that it
is the duty of the grand juror to see
that the school laws are complied
with, that trustees do their duty
and that competent teachers are
employed to teach.
At the conclusion of Judge Moore's
?barge the solicitor handed out a
number indictments, and the grand
jury made a prompt return of the
following cases:
John Price, murder, true bill.
Mack Mims, assault and battery
with intent to kill, true bill.
Calvin Maya, larceny of live stock,
true bill.
Rich Bussey, disposing of prop
erty under lien, true bill.
Tom Bussey, disposing of prop
erty under lien, true bill.
Will Griffin, disposing of prop
erty under lien, true bill.
Early Buffington, house breaking
and larceny, no bill.
Will Griffin, disposing of prop
erty under lien, true bill.
Mack Terry, house breaking and
larceny, no bill.
The first case tried was that of
John Price, indicted for murder.
A verdict of acquittal was rendered.
The defendant was represented by
S. McG. Simkins, Esq., and E. H.
Folk, Esq , and the State by the So
licitor.
Lewis McGee, indicted for dis
posing of property under lien, was
found guilt\, with a recommeuda
Letter From Edgefield Schools.
Edgefield and Trenton played a
very exciting game of basket ball
Saturday morning at the high
school campus. Miss Gladys Rives
acted as referee. This was the first
real game the Edgefield team had
ever played, hence their defeat. The
score was 36-6 in favor of Trenton.
Everybody knows what an expe
rienced team Trenton has and we
offer congratulations to our team
for putting up such a stiff ficht.
We are proud to say we have Tren
ton beat when it comes to goal
throwing. Frances Jones pitched
five goals and Jeanie Simkins one,
which made Edgefield's score. Now
that we know how to go up against
another team, I guarantee that when
Trenton comes over again we will
reverse the score.
A special program for health day
was carried out in chapel Friday
morning. The first number was a
recitation by Elizabeth Lott, after
which Dr. Marsh made a very in
teresting and instructive talk on
''How to keen well." Quotations on
health were then given by a mem
ber of each grade.
1st grade: Martha Thurmond.
2nd grade: Frances Moore.
3rd grade: Elizabeth Paul.
4th grade: Benjamin Cogrmrn.
5th grade: George Tompkins.
6th grade: Wm. Jones,Lois Mims.
7th grade: Norma Shannonhouse.
8th grads: Edwin Folk.
9th grade: Lydia Brunson.
10th grade: Janice Morgan.
11th grade: Lallie Peak.
Dr. Rader, the platform mana
ger of the chautauqua, visited the
school Monday morning. He con
ducted the chapel exercises and
made a splendid talk to the students.
Three important features which he
emphatically stressed were health,
reading and work. Every word bore
a message of advice to the pupils
and it is hoped that each one took
a part if not all of his insfuctions
to heart. We are a'ways delighted >
to have visitors and wish the par- !
ents would come more often. !

Rev. and Mrs. John Lake Are
Again in Active Service in
China. Write of Con
ditions.
Dear Advertiser:
Thank yon so much for resuming
your always welcome visits to us in
our home in Canton, as well as for
following ns so faithfully while we
went, at duty's call, from State to
State in the homeland.
Did we get back to China last
! fall just in time :o see the Republic
go down, and to see the monarchy,
again set np? Well, it looks so;
and yet, who can tell? And if the
monarchy is set up again, who can
tell ?ow long before things will
change again ? Politics in the home
land, who can fathom? Then how
about politics in China? And yet,
Repnblic or monarchy, changes have
come, and they have come to stay,
and many of them are changes for
the better. Of this there can be no
doubt. China will never again be
the China of even ten years ago.
She is in many ways moving to the
front; and-and that makes me will
ing to live and die in China-she is
opening her heart to the Gospel as
she had not done ten years ago, to
say nothing of a hundred years ago.
Temporary back sets? Yos. But
we have them after every revival in
a church in the homeland. And
who would stop for them?
But for the board's earnest desire
that these two wayfarers should re
main as long as we did last year
and help in the great Judson Cen
tennial movement for foreign mis
sions, we should have been hore a
year sooner; and ytt it was no doubt
all for the best, for when we got
here the China Christians were re
joicing over the new church and
school buildings that the Judson
fundl?Ltii . pi ovide, has already pro
Vide?fB^^me im?tftflceg,-gn&ITU "they1 1
uo^unUerstand that we were work
ing for them while in the homeland
just as much as if we had been here, '
especially a? we had the opportu- j
nity of speaking to Chinese in their
own tongue, singly or in groups, or 1
in large congregations, in half the 1
States of* the union. A man who 1
speaks the Cantonese dialects, espe
cially if he knows the sub-dialects
spoken in all the big cities where 1
therBi-are Chinese, aud especially if
his held in China includes Canton 1
i'ity and the Szyap country from
which nearly all of the 70,000 Chi
nese in America have gone, is never
without woik to do.
And now we are back where we ;
are the foreigneis and not they, and
where every hour of the day there
are opportunities for service.
Of the five Baptist churches in
this great city, a city with a popu
lation probably greater than the
whole State of South Carolina, I am
now trying to look after two of
them, besides the work in the Szyap
held southwest of Canton, and at
Tsung Fa, northeast of Canton.
Wife has two girls' schools in this
city to look after now, and a num
ber of othet schools in other parts
of our field. For more than a
month, except for a few days spent
in our annual mission meeting in
Canton, we have been going from
one of our churches or outstations
to another, visiting and conferring
with the Chinese pastors, unor
dained preachers, Bible women, col
porters'and teachers in the boys'
and in the girls' schools, as well as
with the rank and lile of the mem
bers, and as well as holding meet
ings for the heathen. Busy, stren
uous, happy months since we got
back.
The thought that so many in the
old home vown and county and
State are remembering us helps to
make the burden even lighter-the
thought that there is One, in whose
name we came, and who is with us
always, even unto the end, makes
us forget the burden.
You have heard us tell about the
man who threw away the counterfeit
coin, because he was now a Chris
tian. I saw his face beam while I
was preaching at Tsung Fa city the
other day-and, oh! how it beamed,
the next day, when his son, now a
student-teacher ir, our boys' acad
emy, preached! The woman who
burned up her stock of incense sticks,
so as to be received into the church,
she was there, rejoicing, when I
baptized severa!, cunverts into the
membership of that same church.
Little A-foon, now nearly grown,
County Board of Equalization.
The first meeting of the county
board of equalization was held Sat
urday in the office, of Auditor J. R.
Timmerman, the meeting being pre
sided over by the chairman, J. L.
Mims. On account of the intensely
disagreeable day all townships were
not represented. It was unanimously
agreed that all personal property he
assessed at the same valuation as
last year. The real estate will not be
returned again until 1918. As there
has been such a large increase in
the number of motor cars in the
county, it was deemed best to fix a
uniform scale for assessing this
class of property. The board unani
mously agreed after some discus
sion that all cars be returned at 40
per cent, of their purchase price the
first year. 20 per cent, for cars two
years old and 10 per cent, cars ot
less value. The county board will
meet again Saturday, March 25.
Willing to Help With Roads.
One reason no greater progress
is made in road building and road
maintenance is that many farmers
ire not anxious to have a part in
road construction and upkeep. Most
A us realize the impoi tance of good
roads and are pleased to get the
benefits but not all are willing to
help make roads. The fault is that
we want the ?tate, the national gov
?rnment and our neighbors to see to
it that we have good roads.
The success of state and national
lid to road construction and road
improvement will depend upon the
interest the people take. To build
?conomically the people of every
?ornraunity must first see the advan
ces to be derived and then be wili
ng to do their part. There is very
ittle worth while without the
price. The things that come with
?ut effort are seldom satisfying.
We appreciate what we pay for and
?tijoy^?|e^
When the people of the towns
and country unite to build and
maintain roads then will good roads
be available. The co-operation nec
essary for better roads will be a be
triuuing for other needed utilities
and co-operative enterprises that
mean greater economy. As soon as
people agree to do their part in a
co-operative way for better roads
there will be no difficulty in getting
government and state assistance.

We are back among the old

more of the toting men and young
women would decide, if God wills,
to come and share in the toils and
the joyB of this strange life-would
that all might be partners in it by
prayer and gift and faithful work
for the cause at home.
Don't let anybody pity us because
we were so tired when we got home
from China. We have forgotten all
all about that. The touch of the
old home life with our friends and
loved ones revived us. The home
climate renewed us. The atmos
phere of the churches and Christian
homes inspired us. After we had
made all those hundreds of mission
ary talks, and had hid out for a few
months on the Pacific coast, where
we were not known, where we could
listen, and take in, after we had
given out for so many years here,
and then for so many months there,
after we caught our breath well, we
were eager to come back in our new
found strength, and now all we ask
is that we may be spared to do our
best work, and, if it be God's will,
to see you again when time for the
next furlough comes around, in
nineteen twenty something. And
"God be with you till we meet
again."

Music Club Met. Mrs. William
Wright Celebrated 80th
Birthday U D. C. Held
Meeting.
The Apollo music club which is
one of the wide-awake clubs of the
town celebrated Reciprocity day
last Tuesday, this being their first
observance, the club not yet being
two years old. This delightful occa
sion was held in the home of Mrs.
G. D. Walker and the rooms were
attractively decorated in ferns ani
cut flowers. The hostess welcomed
the twenty-five members every one
being present and with these were
representatives- from the local or
ganizations. Mrs. ?. M. Walker,
president, presided and in opening:
extended cordial greetings to those
who had came from sister organiza
tions and she gave a few pleasant
thoughts concerning the occasion
that had brought together this body
of interested women. A short but
very delightful musical program
was enjoyed and Miss Ivey of Au
gusta pleased all with her vocal
numbers, her voice being very
sweet and of wide raoge. She gave
several of the newest selections also.
The feature of the afternoon wa?
the address by Mrs. J. Hardwick
Jackson, president of the Augusta
music club. All were charmed with
her and the message she brought.
After she had concluded her ad
dress she said she would tell the
club something of Josef Hofmann,
the Polish master, whose life and
works, they have just completed.
This information wa? gladly receiv
ed and she was able to tell many
interesting things, as she is often a
visitor in the winter home of the
Hofmanns, at A'ken. She ended
with this pleasantry which occurred
last summer while she waa visiting
in the home of Hofmann, in Switz
the'home and Paderewski who was
also a visitor, introduced ' him to
Hofmann, saying that the two were
vastly different in every way. '*Oh
no, corrected Hofmann," it is only
this: He is a dear soul who loves to
play polo, and I am a little Pole
who loves to play a solo." When
she had concluded all enjoyed chat
ting with her and during the time
an elaborate salad course was served.
In the living room coffee was pour
ed from a beautifully appointed ta
ble and a variety of sandwiches
were o fte reu. The occasion afforded
many pleasures and new thoughts
and ideas were gained, this being so
conducive to club advancement and
general welfare.
On last Saturday Mrs. William
Wright celebrated her 80th birth
day,the day being spent in the home
of her daughter, Mrs. Manning
Simmons, who had planned many
pleasures for her. There were pres
ent a number of her old time ac
quaintances to greet her and there
were many reminiscences of former
days. An elegant dinner was served.
The Fidelis class of the Baptist
Sunday school entertained the mem
bers of the Berean class on Thurs
day evening with a most delightfrl
reception, this being held in the
Sunday school rooms of the church.
The affair was characterized with
informality which greatly appealed
to those of the masculine persua
sion. The colors of the class are
orange and black and the rooms
were attractive with this decoration
and many large bowls of daffodils
were about the. rooms. The chief di
version was an old-time spelling bee,
the sides being chosen by Dr. J. A.
Dobey and J. Howard Payne. There
wis much fun had as some pf the
best apell?is were seated. There
were left standing on the side of
Mr. Payne. During the latter of the
evening a turkey supper, followed
by sweets, were served. All of the
members of the Fidelis class were
dressed in white with a touch of
yellow and orange.
The Mary Ann Buie chapter, D.
of C., met on Thursday afternoon
with Mrs. C, D. Kenny and many
points of interest were discussed.
Committees were appointed for the
rose show of April and also for the
chrysanthemum show. A bazaar will
be held in connection with this and
it was decided to offer prizes. Me
morial day was arranged for and it
was with great pleasure that the
chapter learned that Dr. Pendleton
Jones of Edgefield had accepted the
