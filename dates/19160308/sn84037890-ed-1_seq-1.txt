TRIUMPHS
" IN THSENATE
Gore's Warning Resolu
W tion Tabled
Y A VOTE JIFJIB TO 14
Gore Himself Votes With Ad-
ministration Forces Two
Democrats Voted Nay.
WORDING OP GOItE RESOLUTION
Washington, March 3. By a vote
of 68 to 14, a greater majority than
they expected, administration forces
In the Senate to-day tabled Senator
Gore's resolution to warn Americans
off the armed ships of the European
uelllgerents and thereby finally
quelled in the Senato an agitation
which has embarrassed President
Wilson in the submarine negotia
tions with Germany.
Senator Gore's resolution, a r.ub
stltuto by Senator McCumbcr, a re
publican, and an attempt by Sena
tor Gore to strengthen his original
proposal, all were defeated at ono
time on a roll-call en a motion by
Senator James, one of the adminis
tration whips, to table them. The
administration victory In the Senate
transferred the fight to the House.
Of the fourteen who voted nay,
only O'Gorman and Chamberlain are
Democrats.
Forty-seven Democrats voted aye.
Senator Gore himself voted to ta
"ble his resolution. Senators Cham
"berlaln and O'Gorman were the only
Democrats to vote against the Ad
ministration. The other twelvo
anti-admlnlstratlon votes were all
Republicans ..Hor.ty-four Democrats
and twentw-two Republicans voted
to table the resolution. '
The text of the Gore resolution
follows:
"Whereas, a number of the lead
ing powers of the world are now en
gaged In a war of unexampled pro--portions;
and
Whereas, the United States Is hap
pily at peace with all of the bellig
erent nations; and
"Whereas, it is equally the desire
and the interest of the American
people to remain at peace with all
nations; and
M "Whereas, the President has re
cently afforded fresh and signal
proofs of the superiority of diploma
cy to butchery as a method of set
tling International disputes; and
"Whereas, tho right of American
citizens to travel on unarmed bellig
erent vessels has recently received
renewed guarantees of respect and
Inviolability; and
"Whereas, the right of American
citizens to travel on armed bellig
erent vessels rather than upon un
armed vessels Is essential neithor to
their life, liberty nor safety, nor to
the independence, dignity or secur
ity of the United States; and
"Whereas, Congress alone has
been vested with the power to de
clare war, which Involves tho obli
gations to prevent war by all proper
means consistent with the honor and
vital Interest of the nation: There
fore bo it.
"Resolved by tho Senate, the
House of Representatives concur
ring, that it is the sense of the Con
gress, rested as it is with the solo
p'ower to declare war, that all per
sons owing allegiance to the United
States should, in behalf of their own
safety and the vital interest of tho
United States, forbear to exercise
tho right to travel as passengers
upqn any armed vessel of any bellig
erent power, whether such vessel be
armed for offensive or defensive purJ
poses, and It is the further sense of
the Congress that no passport should
bo issued or ronowed by the Secre
tary of State, or by anyone acting
sunder him, to be used by any person
owing allegiance to tho United States
ifiJr'piirpose of travel upon any such
armed' vwsel of a belligerent pow
er," " N
It was explained that Senator
'James had moved" to lay not only the
Gore warning resolution, but) also
the so-called corrected resolution on
the table. It was necessary then for
Senators to express themselves as
for warning and on the question of
Vllllng as American on an unarmed
merchantman as a causo for war, in
one vote.
For that reason Senator Gore vot
ed to tablo because he did not favor
his own substitute and had Introduc
ed it merely to get an expression of
tho Senate on that Issue.
Tlie text of Senator Gore's addi
tion to Iris original resolution and
which was tabled with the warning
resolution, was as follows:
"Resolved, by tho Sennte, the
House of Representatives concur
ring. That the sinking by a German
submarine without notice or warn
ing of an armed merchant vessel of
her public enemy, resulting In the
death of a citizen of the United
States, would constitute a just and
sufficient cause of war between the
United States and the German Em
pire." RESIGNATION OF BRYAN
GAVE HOPE TO GERMANY
Washington, March 4. President
Wilson's position on the Internation
al situation, out of which has grown
the question of this country's posi
tion on the armed merchantmen con
troversy, was revealed further to
day. Ho told congressional leaders
that It was months after the resigna
tion of former Secretary Bryan bo
fore the United States could convince
Germany that this nation Is In earn
est in Its position on submarine war
fare. He said that" the charges
made that he wanted to got the Unit
ed States Into war were entirely dis
proved by his attitude during the
last two years. He Is willing to do
anything except sacrifice tho nation's
honor In order to maintain the Unit
ed States at peace. At the same
time he did not see how the United
States could do anything but sever
diplomatic relations with any nation
which killed Americans in violation
of International law. He represent
ed that the German ambassador and
Secretary Lansing have thoroughly
discussed the situation, and that the
former" fully understands that in tho
event of a complete disagreement
diplomatic relations must bo broken
off. Ambassador Bernstoff, tho
President says, shares the hopo that
nothing of the kind will over occur.
THE GREATEST OCEAN

chine gun company, and ono extra

ter was estimated at 870, it is Indi
cated by the foregoing dispatch that
upwards of 3,130 lives wero lost.
The loss of more than 3,000 lives
Is the greatest ocean disaster of
modern times. Up to the present
tho largest number of lives over lost

SIATE PRIMARY
WIILJPSTLY
For Indiana Taxpayers and
Candidates.
THE EXPENSEJ092 GQUNTIES
May Total Between $400,000 and
$600,000 Fortunes Spent
By Candidates.
NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING IMG
Indianapolis, March 4. That the
State-wide primary, to be held In In
diana next Tuesday Is going to bo
an expensive proposition both to
taxpayers and candidates for ofilce is
tho opinion of political leaders of all
parties. Thero Is much speculation
as to what It will cost tho State and
those estimates vary, but no estl
mate has been lower than an aver
age of $5,000 a county. The lowest
estimate, therefore, Is $4G0,000 for
tho ninety-two counties of the State,
Some politicians think the cost will
run to $G00,000.
Marion county, In which Indian
apolls Is situated, has already np
proprlated $34,000 to pay tho ex
penses of the primary. Some county
officials say this will not bo enough.
Some of the smaller counties may
not have to spend, It is estimated,
more than $3,000. But the, larger
counties, like Lake, Vigo, St. Joseph,
Allen and Vanderburg, and perhaps
a few others, will. It Is believed.
hnvo to pay out $15,000 or 'more,
Until all tho printing bills are in,
however, it will not bo possible to
ascertain the cost of tho primary
with any certain degree of accuracy.
That the primary Is hitting the
candidates hard, there Is no ques
tion. Practically all of the political
leaders say that there was never any
candidate who made a canvass for
an office, to be nominated at a con
vention, that ever spent anything
like what the primary Is costing. Tho
greatest Item of expense In the pri
mary is for newspaper advertising.
The candidates are using this meth
od of appealing to the voter more
than ever before.
Because of the lack of contest, the
Democratic canldatcs for the higher
offices have not been called to spend
large amounts. The Progressive
candidates are spending practically
nothing. It is tho Republicans who
are making tho strenuous campaign.
Republican candidates for United
State Senators and Governor and
there are three each for these two
offices are making great appeal to
tho voters by displaying their pho
tographs, with reading matter. In
tho newspapers. Tho Increase In the
use of this sort of advertising has
been marked. Most of tho advertise
ments are two columns wide and ten
inches or twenty Inches long. Thero
are about 1C0 regulnr Republican
newspapers In the State and about
forty others carrying this advertis
ing. Ono insertion of the usual
twenty-Inch ad. In these papers costs
$1,000 at a conservative estlmato.
Republican candidates for Senator
and Governor have had such adver
tisements in this string of newspa
pers anywhere from three to a dozen
times. This ropotltlon Is explained
by the fact that some of tho men be
gan their active campaign last Aug
ust whllo others began theirs later.
Campaign buttons, stickers, cards,
posters, streot car ads and pennants
have been distributed with a lavish
hand.
Next to tho advertising, the next
item of expenso probably, is for
transportation and hotel bills ot the
candidates and their inanagers. Tho
motor car has played a great part In
the primary. With tho use of tht3
means of transportation, a candidate
Is ablo to address soveral meetings
a day. All tho candidates for Sen
ator and Governor claim they hnvo
visited every county In the State at
least once, and It Is understood that'
ono ot tho senatorial candidates Is
making his third trip to every coun
ty In tho State.
Postage has been a big item ot
expense. It Is estimated that each
candldato has sent out from 100,000
to 200,000 p(ccc8 ot mall and most
of this has gone "first class." The
printing ot circulars has also cost a
lot of money.
Not tbo least of tho candidates'
expenses has been the maintenance
of headquarters, consisting of largo
suites of rooms In downtown hotels
or ofilce buildings In! Indianapolis.
Some of the candidates even have
maintained headquarters recently in
tho larger cities of the State, outsido
of the capital. This has meant the
employment of clerks, stenographers
and messengers, all of which ha3
cost considerable. Telephone and
telegraph tolls will run Into hun
dreds of dollars.
Various estimates have been made
ns to the amount the different candi
dates will spend. Some are speculat
ing that two of tho most active can
didates for Governor and two for
Senator will have expended close on
to $200,000 at the close of primary
day. They figure that it will cost
each ono approximately $50,000.
The .expenses will not cease until the
polls are closed, as some of the can
didates, It Is declared, will have mo
tor cars at every precinct In the
State to see that their friends get to
tho polls, as well as hired workers
at the 3,177 voting precincts.
AVEAPONS HV CARTLOADS
DISCOVERED IN IIASTIIiE
Boston, March 3. Many cartloads
of knives, chisels, files and black
jacks, relics of unsuccessful plan3
of escape from the House of Correc
tion at Deer Island during a half
century, were found to-day between
the walls of the old prison, which
are being repaired.
The collection was explained by
officials as representing the efforts
of prisoners at various times to rid
themselves of smuggled articles,
when the signal was passed along

ing a general search of the cells.
Ventilators communicate with tho
space between the walls, and the
contraband articles were thrown
through the openings.

WARNING NOTICE
ACTIONJELflYED
In the House For Various
Reasons.
NO DOUBT ftSJOJHE RESULT
When Vote Is Taken Bryan's
Presence In Washington
Complicates Situation.
.SOME REASONS FOR THE DELAY
Washington, March 4. The House
again to-day postponed action on
proposals to warn American citizens
not to travel on armed merchant
ships, defeat of which has been re
quested by President Wilson to
strengthen his hands In the negotia
tions with Germany. It was decided
that not before Tuesday would a
vote be taken, and a Wearying day of
conferences and maneuvering left
more doubt than ever as to just what
form the House action, when the
time finally came, would take.
Supporters of the President In hip
stand for the right of Americans to
safety aboard merchantmen bearing
arms, reiterated that there was no
uncertainty that the House sooner
or later would follow the lead of the
Senate In killing the warning pro
posals. Tho problem of framing a
parliamentary plan, however, which
will have the necessary committee
sanction, and which will be assured
of acceptance by the House Itself,
remained unsolved.
Some representatives professed to
see in the arrival in the Capital of
Williams Jennings Bryan, who filled
a speaking engagement here to
night, a development which might
further complex the situation con
fronting the President's supporters
In the House. Mr. Bryan conferred
during the afternoon with many of
his friends, including some members
of Congress, and discussed the move
ment for a congressional warning,
which he Is known to favor. He de
nied, however, as did those with
whom he talked, that he was on the
ground to help organize opposition
to the President's desires.
House leaders advanced many rea
sons In support of their decision
against a vote" to-day or Monday on
the recommendation of the Foreign
Affairs Committee that the McLe
more warning resolution bo tabled.
Prominent among them was the fail
ure of tho Rules Committee to agree
after a long session on what sort of
rulo should bo brought In to govern
debate. Acting Chairman Pou and
Represmtattve Garrett, of tho com
mittee, went to the White House to
night to discuss that feature with
President Wilson.
Other reasons contributing to tho
delay included:
Insistence of some Democrats, in
cluding Democratic Leader Kltchln,
that Instead of voting on the For
eign Affairs Committee recommenda
tion to tablo Representative McLe
more's resolution, thero be reported
a substitute requiring a straight
vote on a warning resolution.
Absence of many Democratic
members from Washington on week
end trips.
Unwillingness by Speuker Clark
to entertain n tabling motion on
Monday, which is unanimous consent
day.
Pleas of Indiana Democrats that
no vote be taken beforo tho Indiana
primaries are hold next Tuesday.
The desire of many members for
the longest possible delay In the
hope that they nover will have to go
ot record on tho proposition.
Doubt as to tho tempor ot Ropub
llan members.
Soon after the Houso convenod to
day Acting Chairman Pou announc
ed that his committee- had decided
there should bo no voto until Mon
day. Then Speaker Clark added to
tho perplexities of thoso In charge of
tho Pro'ldont's fight by announcing
ho would not recognlzo a motion to
bring the proposal up Monday be
cause It was unanimous consent day.
An Informal meeting of Democrat
ic members of the Rules Committee,
Majority Leader Kltchln, Chairman
Flood, of the Foreign Affairs Com
mlttoo, and tho Speaker followed.
In tho course of a lively two hours'
session on tho auestlon of framing
a rule, Mr. Kltchln brought forward
his proposal- for a straight warning
resolution. The President's backers
refused to entertain tho suggestion.
Tho attitude of the Administration
was plainly, they said, for killing
the McLemoro resolution on the
iloor and making an end of tho
whole matter.

cause of the strain of the foreign
sltuntlont wub considering reslgnlns
