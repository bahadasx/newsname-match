Important, but critics are warning
them the, Germans may make -their
boldest strike In that region, north
west of Verdun.
In order to continue their advance,
the Germans must charge np the side
of Goose hllL In anticipation of such
a smash, the French have made the
1,000 yards of barren, rocky alope in
to a veritable death trap. Every foot
of It la mined, and behind the French
lines engineers wait to touch elec
trict buttons which would send whole
sections of the district skyward In a
burst of flame and hurl hundreds of
men into eternity at a single blow.
Besides these mines, the ground Is
covered with a maze of barbed wire
entanglements and cut up with pit
falls. Troops could make but alow pro
gress over it, and aa they advanced
among mines, pitfalls and barbed
wire, they would be constantly ex
posed to a concentrated fire from all
the French' machine guns on Goose
hill. It is estimated It would coat
the Germans 10,000 lives to storm
Goose hill, but critics admit It might
be worth the price.
Berlin is strangely silent regard
ing the most important fighting to
the northwest of Verdun. Even
French reports of German gains are
not confirmed by Berlin. The mes
sages from the German capital are

DILLEN WAS HUGO
L
Hugo, Ore., Mar. 8. School Direc
tor Chas. L. Dillen was instantly kill
ed yesterday afternoon, and his son-
in-law, George Barrett, was seriously
Injured in an auto collision with a
southbound Southern Pacific freight
train at a road crossing about two
hundred yards north of the station
at Hugo.
The railroad at this point runs vir
tually north and south. Approach
ing the crossing from the west, the
front seat of the auto was occupied
by Mr. Dillen and Mr. Barrett the
latter acting as driver. In the rear
seat, until a few moments before the
collision, were Mrs. Dillen and Mrs.
Barrett West of the track, and with
in thirty yards of It, the auto stop
ped, the ladles alighted and the car
started ahead. The freight engine
waa then about 75 yards north of the
crossing and was moving perhaps ten
miles an hour.
Seeing his danger, Mr. Barrett set
the brakes, and for a moment the
wheels skidded, but within a yard
began again to revolve and the ma
chine started forward with acceler
ated speed. The locomotive engtneer
blew a number of short blasts of the
whistle, and Mr. Barrett, having lost
control of the brakes, attempted ' ta
turn to the left. He was too late, for
the right fore-wheel of the auto
mounted the west rail of the track
Just as the pilot of the engine reached
that point.
At the moment of collision Mr.
Dillen either Jumped or was thrown
from the machine. He was caught In
the wreckage and dragged with It un
til the engine was brought to a stand
still, about a hundred feet south of
the crossing. His head and the upper

Tacoma, Mar. 8 Description of
the five yeggmen Who Tuesday shot
to death Vernon Lindsay In a room
ing house here, were sent out by the
police today and it la believed they
will soon be arrested.
Patrolman Nix engaged In a fight
with the gang In a Tacoma avenue
hotel Monday night, a short time
after Lindsay was riddles with bul
lets a few blocks away. Nix tried
to arrest one ot the men for firing
his revolver on the street, not know
ing at the time of the murder. While
Nix was ' telephoning police head
quarters for help, the five men made
their escape. The police theory is
that they are yeggmen and that
Lindsay waa shot to death In a quar
rel over the division of loot or fear
that he Intended to expose their ope
rations. ' - '
Vernon Lindsay, the young man
murdered in Tavoma Tuesday, waa
born in the Murphy district 20 years
ago. He was the son ot Mr. and
Mrs. J. B. Lindsay, pioneer residents
ot the Applegate valley.- The young
man left here about two years ago
and: went to Tacoma, where he waa
employed as a salesman for a tea
and coffee house, and received good
wages. In a recent letter to his
parents, he stated that he was at

tion was open to him as soon aa he

Hj was a cripple; having lost one
leg through the ravages ot tuber
culosis. The father came in from
Murphy this morning, after leanlng
through the Ttourler of the killing
ot his son, and Is arranging to have
the body shipped here for burial.
From a description of the dead man
wired him today by Mayor Fawcett
of Tacoma, Mr. Lindsay says that he
has no doubts about the .Identity of
the body. He believes that his son
was killed by the yeggmen for rob
bery, and that he was not party to
their operations, as the police of
Tacoma seem to Infer.
ENGLAND'8 FORMER FIRST
SEA LORD AT COUNCIL
London, Mar. 8. Sir John Fisher,
former first sea lord, attended today's
meeting of the British war council.
In some quarters It was suggested he
was summoned to learn If his views
on naval operations coincided with
those of Colonel Winston Churchill,
former first lord of the admiralty.
Others saw a possibility of Sir John
resuming his former post In com
mand of the British navy.

The final ballot of 27$ to 143

administration supporters that con

his feelings toward Europe. '
Congress still seethed today on the
armed liner issue. It was believed
another debate might break out at
any time and continue indefinitely.
Several ' representatives are expected
to seize the first opportunity of ex
plaining their votes on the warning
measure.
Senator Stone has definitely pre
pared his explanation, and it may be
delivered soon. 7 ' ' ' v
Bickering over the effect of the .
house vote promises! to continue.
Those opposed to the administration
argued that the merits ot the real
Issue whether Americans should be
warned to keep off armed liners
were still unsettled. The agitation
tor such a warning Is expected to
continue, ibut the chance that there
will be another vote on the proposi
tion Is remote. '
Advocates of a warning 1 pointed
out the roll calls showed there was a
real division between President Wil
son and congress on the armed liner
policy of the president.
The White House, however, felt
there was no danger Ot Germany mis
construing the president's' support In
congress. " The political effect of the
contest is in doubt -
More defections . besides those of
Congressmen Page and Sherwood are
expected. Republicans, it is believed,
will enlarge on the administration's
refusal to permit a vote on the merits
ot issuing a 'warning.'
