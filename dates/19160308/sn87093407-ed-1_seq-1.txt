MAYOR'S LEAD IS CUT TO 5,372
It. _ - s 1 i
THE ELECTION
Now that it it all over, a few words
with Star readers:
The Star today feel# proud to have
fought and to have lost the fight it did
for the Man it supported, for the cause
it represented and for the people who
stood with it.
IJ It was from the first an uphill battle. It wns,
in the opinion of most everybody, a losing fight,
and yet nearly 30,000 voter* cast their ballot*
(or a man they almoct knew would be a loser.
(f On the day after the primary, when Gill
a lead of more than 15,000 vote* on Griffiths,
the easiest way for The Star would have been
to let the campaign go bv default. A good many
friends even advised The Star to take that
easiest way.
€J Rut to The Star the easy way did not appear
to be the right way and. even tho this paper
well knew the hopelessness of the fight, so far
as electing Mr. Griffiths was concerned, this
paper chose to fight for what it thought was
right.
(J The Star expected to be the target for all the
abuses, all the falsehoods and all the mud that
was thrown at it. It expected the other papers,
one of them at least, would resort to their same
old despicable tactics. It expected the stabs in
the back and it had a pretty fair and accurate
idea of the assaults from ambush that were
being framed up, but The Star preferred to sup
port a man like Griffiths and lose than shirk an
unpleasant task or to be a band wagon shouter.
tj In the opinion of The Star, Hiram C. Ciill
does not typify Seattle. He does not typify
Seattle people, or Seattle thought.
IJ The Star believes that just as sincerely this
morning as it believed it when the campaign
started.
<J However. Hiram C. Gill is elected mayor and
The Star has for him only good wishes. The
Star's attitude toward Gill today, elected against
The Star, is just the same as it was two years
ago today, when Gill was elected by 14,000
with The Star's support. Then, The Star
cautioned Hi Gill to watch his step and aaaured
him that The Star would be erer ready to help
him be the "beat mayor Seattle ever had."
