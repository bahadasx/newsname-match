Queen Lllluokalani has discontinued
the equity- suit broufiht by Delepate
Kuhlo aeainst the trustees oi tue uui
uokalanl Trust, us far as her being a
implafriant Is concerned, 'according
v to an oral decision handed down in
the supreme court today.
' The original suit was : brought by
,Kuhkv rpnre&entine . himself as "next

slon had to do with a petition filed by
the queen's attorney to prohibit Cir

Ly the bucreme court. - ; '
It is held by the supreme court that
Kuhlo Is rightly a party In the suit in
the lower court, although this was not
the contention of Judge Antonio er
ry, counsel for. the queen. The court
further holds that any discontinuance
by the queen could not operate in so
far as the delegate being a party to
' the suit is concerned, -! ' '
On the other hand, it Is held that
the queen is not a party to the suit,
and for this reason the writ of pro-
hibitioa asked for by her counsel was
denied. " " - '" '.';'-' ,
Sane and Competent ,"
' The court added in thiB connection
that there Is a presumption that the
queen Is Bane and competent to dls-
continue the suit, and : that she has

ing a complainant. is concerned, it be
ing h'.l-tLte is noionger a patty

. As far ss the queen is concerned,
' lliercfore. the suit Is at an end. Her
counsel toay stated that, as she is
not a party to thty action, she cannot
hare a "next friend or a guardian,"
- The discontinuance' by the queen
will not operate as far as the, delegate
is concerned. As the case now stands,
' there is a suit still in effect with Ku-
hn in sole DlaintiJf. and with the-;
trustees of the Liliuokalani Trust; and
others, as defendants. The supreme
court may issue a written decision
either to3ay or tomorrow. ;
Further action in he case may be
