to Carry Out Plan; New Move
Launched at Meeting of
Merchants
There will be no style show i-i fjhick
asha as planned some time ago, but
in its place a May festival will prob
ably be staged.
This w-as the decision reached at a
meeting of merchants held at the C.
& P. bureau headquarters last even
ing. After some discussion it was general
ly agreed that the Reason is too far ad
vanced to make the style show plan
a success. Practically all present fa
vored the idea and the suggestion was
advanced by aeveral that it should be
carried out next year, arrangements
being made early. '
The May festival move was proposed
by L. Erlich and at once met with
general favor. A committee was ap
pointed to work out a program, with
details of plana fcr the fete which
would probably continue two or three,
days, and this committee will report
at a meeting of all merchants in the
city, to be held, it ds hoped, within
a week. It is understood that the
Woman's college is planning an elab
orate May Day celebration and it Is
thought that the entertainment to be
given there will fit wall Into the

way.

LABOR AFFILIATED

Non-Political Ministry of Commerce Advo

Empire and Tariff Walls Against
Enemies Proposed
By WILBUR S. FORREST.
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
LONDON, March 8. Preliminaries
to the greatest commercial vendetta in
history ara cn in England today. If
England was unprepared for war in
August, 1914, there Is no indication she
will be unprepared for the great trade
war against Germany which Is to fol
low sterner hostilities.
British commercial manufacturing
and financial institutions are rapidly
welding themselves Into a central or
ganization which will have for its sole
purpose the strangling ot German
trade everywhere. This central or
ganization, as already outlined, during
a great meeting just held at the Guild
hall, London, has for Its purpose also
an affiliation with British labor which
will give the British worker the most
powerful voce In history of unionism
for the promotion of his welfare. Reso
lutions adopted agree that labor shall
have a place in the organization and
administration of the anti-German
campaign on an 3qual footing with em
ployers;
Labor has been asked to Join In a
great demand on the government for
non-political ministry ot commerce.
A remodeling of British technical and
commercial education Is to be demand
ed ot' the proposed ministry. That the
British consular service throughout the
world shall consist of the best edu
cated and most practical business gien
that England can produce, .s anoiner
demand. British consuls, it was agreed
by the hundreds of leading commer
cial and finanlcial heads attending the
meeting, shall be paid Mku salaries
with substantial cash, bonuses for any
considerable increase in British trado
in their respective licalltes.
Allied iwith more than 10J) Chambers
ot Commerce representing practically
every commercial center In the Brit
ish empire, the London Chamber of
Commerce presented the following
lecommendations which were unani
mously adopted:
For reciprocal trade relations be
tween all parts of the British empire;
preferential trade with England's al
lies; pen.i izing eneiry countries by
tariffs and otherwise.
A committee of the government
Board of Trade commissioned to Inves
tigate and recommend changes to the
advantage of British commerce today
also is on record with a lengthly list
of vital reforms designed to protect
the Biitish producer against foreign
eomnetition. The recommendations bar
German mechanical toys from import
and place heavy duties on enemy
glass and leather year. The govern
ment Is asked for a vigorous enforce,
ment of foreign patent laws and among
ether things, for laws making It obli
gatory that foreign good3 be plainly
stamped as such.
Representatives from more than 10ft
British Chambers ot Commerce met in
London recently to frame further

British bankers are planning a meet
