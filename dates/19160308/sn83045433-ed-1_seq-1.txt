MAKES PUBLIC
"SUB" SECRETS
Edison, in Catalog, Describes
Details of Battery
for U-Boats.
U. S. SHIPS NOW TRYING OUT
HIS LATEST INVENTION
Department Officials Surprised By
Such Action, Which Is Unusual.
Although Not Illegal.
Considerable surprise is being ex
pressed in Navy Department circles
over the publication in catalog form
of detailed information concerning the
Edison submarine batteries now being
tried out by the United States navy.
It is published by Thomas A. Edison,
the inventor of the battery.
The catalog has been gotten out in
elaborate form with detailed photo
graphs of various parts of the bat
teries, and with technical description.
including chemical formulae, of the
construction and characteristics of the
batteries.
It closes with an invitation to par
ties interested to "address all corres
pondence in relation to Edison Storage
Batteries, for use or proposed use In
connection with any navy or army
boats or apparatus, to Thomas A. Edi
son, Orange. N. J."
Secretary of the Navy Daniels when
asked this afternoon concerning the
publication declared that he knew
nothing about it. No official of the
detartment could be found who knew
of Mr. Edison ever having asked per
mission to make public the details of
the batteries.
Such Publication Unusual.
While it was declared that there is
no law to prevent such publication,
officials of the department expresses
surprise that it should have been pub
lished without consulting the depart
(ment.
The problem of finding suitable bat
teries is one of the hardest which gov
ernments have to contend with in
building submarines. The success of
the German submarines Is attributed
largely to the batteries which they
use, though the secrets of these bat
teries are well guarded.
Although the Edison battery was on
the submarine E-., on which an ex
plosion recently occurred in the New
York Navy Yard. due to the ignition
of hydrogen gas generated from the
battery, the Navy Department experts
are of the opinion that with proper
ventilation systems on the submarines
the gas danger could be eliminated.
SHERWOOD WILL RETIRE;
DIFFERS WITH PRESIDENT
Ohio Representative Claims He Can
not Seek Re-election After Presi
dent's Preparedness Program.
Representative Isaac It. Sherwood. of
Ohio, a Democrat, has decided to retire
to private life because he finds that he
is net In harmcny with the Wilson is
sue. Orposed to the President on the
armed merchantmen issue, Mr. Sher
wood felt it to be his duty yesterday
to vote to table the McLemore resolu
tion of warning. in necordance with the
wishes of Mr. Wilson.
Representative Sherwood announced
that, although he is opposed to the
national defense bills, he will vote for
them for the reason that he believes
all Demperats should uphold the I'resi
dent.
"So long as I am In Congress. I shall
vote to sustain the President. but as I
do not want to be here and be over
ridden on everything I believe in, I
have decided not to be a candidate for
re-election "said Representative Sher
wood. "I think my district should be
represented by some one who is in
esym~athy with the administration.I
cannot seek ft-election on a platform
that pledges the party to militarismi.
My convictions against the policy of
extreme preparedness are such that I
cs-n not and will not seelt re-election
on the President's preparedness plat
form."

GERMAN FLEET
HELD MENACE
BY CHURCHILL
former First Lord of Admiral
ty Returns From Trenches
to Address Commons.
PASSIVITY CRITICIZED
Urges That Lord Fisher Be
Recalled to Admiralty to
"Inject New Life."
MR. BALFOUR OPENS DEBATE
(Relates Achievements of British Fleet
and Declares Its Usefulness Has
Been Largely Increased.
Srecial cable to The Washingtm Heald.
London, March 7.-Col. Winston Chur
chill, former first lord of the admiralty,
came back from the trenches to warn the
house of commons today that it must
beware of the German fleet.
"We must not assume," he said, "that
Germany will be content to allow her fleet
to lie impotent and derided in the Kiel
Canal. We must assume that something
has happened in the German naval yards
and that Germany hasocompleted all he,
program."
In a sensational speech Mr. Churchill
proceeded to criticise the admiralty for
its "pure strategic passivity" since he
had resigned its control. He urged his
successor, Arthur Balfour. to recall Lord
Fisher to the admiralty for the purpose
of injecting new life into It.
Fisher Once Hife ietu.
Lord Fisher, it will he remembered,
was first sea lord of the admiralty when
Mr. Churchill was the first lord, and it
was differences of opinion between the
two men that led to Mr. Churchil's re
tirement. Mr. Churchill Is now urging
upon his successor the man with whom
he himself could not get along.
Lord Fisher was present during Mr.
Churchill's speech. As he rose to leave
the peers' gallery he was loudly cheered
by the army and navy men in the house.
Mr. Churchill's speech followed a state,
ment by Mr. Balfour. in which the latter
painteel in bright colors the achievements
of the navy. It had transported 400,020
troops since the war began, said Mr.
Balfour. Its personnel had been doubled
and its weight increased 1,000,000 tons. Its
air service had increased tenfold.
Nevertheless, Mr. Bal )ur was forced
to admit that the German raider Moewe
had escaped its cordon, and he confirm
od the Glerman report that the Moewe
had now succeeded in getting back to
a German port unmolested by any British
warship.
Debate on Estimates.
The debate came up on the introdue
lion on the navy estimates by Mr. Bal
four, who said he only proposed giving
a general impression of the course which
the admiralty was pursuing to carry on
the responsIbilities resting upon the Brit
ish Empire. 'The policy under his ad
ministe-ation, he said, had been directly
continuous on that of his predecessor.
Mr. RaIfuur continued:
"l"our million combatants, a million
horses and mules. 2,5f0,000 tons of stores,
and '.,500 )0 gallons of oil have been
carried during the war under the guard
ianship of the British fleet. This task,
In the presence of hostile submarines, has
thrown an enormous amount of work
upon the admiralty which could not be
foreseen at the outbreak of the war.
"The dangers experienced have been
new dangers and I feel that the nation
can look with satisfaction at the man
ner In which the admiralty has carried
out its vast work. The British fleet
has become an International fleet, arry
ing on international work and serving
many nations.

miralty. It evoked cheers from all parts
of the house.
HITS WILSON
AS "SPINELESS"
Senator Sutherland Calls
Mexican Policy One of
"Scuttle and Run."
PREFERS WAR TO PEACE
IF HONOR IS AT STAKE
Votes With Wilson on Armed Liner
Question and Opposes Embargo
on Munitions.
Senator George Sutherland, of Utah,
made a notable speech in the Senate
yesterday on the submarine issue and
the proposed resolutions to warn
Americans- off belligerent ships.
Senator Sutherland is against the
proposed warning and he is opposed to
an embargo on exports of munitions.
Aligning himself with the President
so far as the warning resolution is
concerned the Senator, however, char
acterised as "spineless" the policy of
retreat and scuttle-the policy that.
among other things, had ordered our
people to abandon their rights in Mex
ico and that has made us flee our own
plain duty in the Philippines."
"Instead of forever telling our citi
zens to run. I should like for once to
hear somebody bid them stand with
the assurance that their government
would stand with them.
"I do not want war at any time and
I pray God that it may not come, not
now; but I would rather have war with
all its sacrifices and suffering than
that this nation with its long history
of heroism and glory should play the
poltroon -when confronted by a su
preme national duty because it places
a higher value upon its ease than
upon its honor.
"A nation that will not resent a
flagrant and illegal attack upon the
ives of its citizens is only less de
testable than the man who will not
fight for his wife and children."
The Senator declared that if the
United States conceded the right of
the submarine to sink an armed mer
chantman without warning it might
as well concede the right to sink an
unarmed one, for it was almost im
possible for a submarine to determine
whether a vessel was armed cr un
armed.
