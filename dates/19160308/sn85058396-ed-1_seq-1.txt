FRANCE SORE OF
FINAL VICTORY
Germans, at Cost of Large
Losses, Obtain Command of
Approaches to Man
French Positions.
REAL FIGHT TO BEGIN
Enemy to Hurl Masses Again
on Four Miles of Heights
Yesterday's Battle
Undecided.
Paris, March 8, 5:45 p. m. France
awaits anxiously but confidently the
Issue of today's battle. The Germans
thus far, at the cost of large losses,
have obtained command of the ap
proaches to the main French positions
beyond the west bank of the Meuse
The real struggle will begin when
German masses hurl themselves again
on the four miles of heights extending
from Bethlncourt to Cumieres.
Yesterday's attacks left the battle
undecided. Corbeaux wood, in which
the Germans succeeded In establish
ing themselves, Is within a hollow be
tween Deadman and Goose hills and,
as neither position is endangered, the
German success is of little strategic
importance.
300,000 Men For Task.
It is known hero that the Germans
set aside 300000 men to capture Vor
dun. Only 200,000 having been em
ployed up to yesterday. It was a ques
tion whether the remaining 100,000
would be used to make a sudden do
scent on some other part of tho
French line in developing the offen
sive against the fortress. The heavy
attack west of the river, however,
leaves that question no longer to be
settled.
The Impression of members of par
liament, who are kept regularly In
formed as to the progress of the bat
tle, Is that the defense will bo able
to resist all onslaughts the Germans
are able to make and that Goose hill,
on the left bank,, will play a role sim
ilar to Douaumont on the right. It Is
expected that the battle -will reach its
climax tomorrow or Friday. Not un
til then will it be possible to judge
which way tho battle will go.

RAILROAD MEN
CAST THEIR VOTE
Chicago, March 8 Tabulation of
the referendum vote of railroad em
ployes on the question of whethei
their demand for an eight-hour day
with time and a half for overtime
shall be presented to the railroads,
was taken up today at a meeting of
union officials. The present wage
agreement of the employes expires
March 31.
The vote of tho employes has been
in progress by mail for more than two
months and It is said more than
eighty per cent of the men have voted
in favor of the eight-hour day with
oertime
About 400,000 railway emplo'es, in
cluding every road In the country, or
528 different lines, are involved in
the present controversy. The leaders
aro said to be opposed to arbitrating
their differences this year, although
they express the hope that a general
strike, which would tie up every
steam railroad- In the countrjr, will
not be necessary.
Railroad officials have declared
that the eight-hour day and overtime
"demanded by the employes would
bring an Increase in wages of approxi
mately $100,000,000 a year and this
increase cannot be granted under ex
isting conditions
W. S. Stone, head of the Brother
hood of Locomotive Engineers, said
the referendum vote had been con
cluded but that an announcement of
the tabulation may not be made for

Washington, March 8 Senator
Stone of Missouri, chairman of the
foreign relations committee, declared
in the. senate today, after a conference
with President Wilson last night, that
"so far from the president desiring to
Involve this country In this disastrous
war, his supreme wish is to avoid that
calamity "
Washington, March 8. President
Wilson today authorized Representa
tive Pou to deny as 'utterl' 'foolish"
a rumor which had reached the house
to the effect that the president had
changed his mind and was preparing
to Issue warning against Americans
taking passage on armed merchant
men. Mr. Pou denied tho report on

RUSSIANS LAND
NEAR JREB1Z0ND
Black Sea Coast Maneuvers
Attracting Great Attention
Turk Towns Being
Taken.
SERIES OF SURPRISES
Fleet and Coast Troops Skill
fully Co-operating Rus
sians Steadily Advance.
Petrograd, March7, via London
March 8, 12:27 a. m. The success of
the Russian Black sea coast maneuv
ers, in which the Russians landed
forces to the east of Trebizond, is at
tracting great attention. This Is not
due solely to the Russian strategy
which is gradually expelling the Turks
irom the coast towns on the way to
Trebizond, but because upon the
favorable conclusion of these opera
tions rests the possibility of the con
tinued advance of tho central Russian
army toward Slvas., The capture by
the Russians of Trebizond, if it mater
ializes, will enable the central army
to resume Its westward march.
The Russian progress along the
Anatolian coast has been the result
of a series of strategic surprises,
made possible by the skilful co-operation
between the fleet and coast
troops. Tho fleet being used as a
mobile right wing for the troops
operating along the shore, has advanc
ed well ahead of the land forces and
struck at the Turkish forces on the
flank and rear, and forced them to
retire Landing parties then join the
land forces In occupying the abandon
edcoast towns.. In this way the vill
ages of Atlna and Mapavra have been
taken and the Russians are making
steady progress along the road to
Riza which is 30 miles east, to Trebiz
ond. r
Since the country along the shoro,
with its mountain ridges rising from
6,000 to 10,000 feet, offers an Insur
mountable barrier to a frontal attack,
the Russian staff apparently has
decided to depend solely upon" a con
tinuance of the coast maneuvers to
drive the Turks from this region.
The Turkish losses during the last
days of fighting are said to have been
ery severe

BERNSTDRFF EXPLAINS IN DETAIL I
ATTITUDE ON ARMED SHIP ISSUE I
German Ambassador Relates Causes Leading Up to Decision
to Torpedo All Armed Merchantmen Great Britain B
Takes Advantage of U. S. Contention Germany H
Concedes That, as Submarines Are New En- M
gines of War, International Law Makes M
No Provision for Their Use.-
Washington, March S The German
government, in a memorandum hand
ed today by Count von Bernstorff to
Secretary Lansing, outlines in detail
its position in regard to armed ships,
reviews events up to its decision to
torpedo without warning all armed
merchantmen of its enemies, concedes
that International law as at present
constituted, makes no provision for
the use of submarines and expresses
a willingness to operate Its submar
ines in accordance with international
law prevailing prior to the war on the
condition that Great Britain does not
violate tho same laws.
Von Bernstorff's Statement.
The text of the memorandum pre
sented by Count von Bernstorff fol
lows: "The imperial German government
on account of the friendly relations,
which have always existed between
the two great nations and earnestly
desiring to continue them, wishes to
explain the U-boat question once more
to the American government.
"At the outbreak of the war the
German government, acting upon the
suggestion of the United States im
mediately expressed its readiness to
ratify the Declaration of London. At
that time a German prize code had
already been issued, which was en
tirely and without modification, based
upon the rules of the Declaration of
London. Germany thereby proved her
willingness to recognize fully tho ex
isting rules of international law which
ensure the freedom of the seas for
the legitimate trade of neutral na
tions not only among themselves but
also with belligerent countries.
Great Britain Declines.
"Great Britain, on the other hand,
declined to ratify the Declaration of
London, and, after the outbreak of
the war, began to restrict the legiti
mate trade of the neutrals in order
to hit Germany. The contraband pro
visions were systematically extended
on August fifth and twentieth, Sep
tember 21 and October 29, 1914. On
November 3, 1914, tho order of the
British admiralty followed declaring
the whole North sea a war zone In
which commercial shipping would be
exposed to the most serious danger
from mines and men of war. Protests
from neutrals were of no avail and
from that time on the freedom of neu
tral commerce with Germany was
practically destroyed. Under these
circumstances, Germany was compel-1
led to resort, in February, 1915, to
leprisals In order to fight her oppo-
nents' measures which were absolute
ly contrary to international law. She
chese for this purpose a new weapon,
the use of which had not yet been
regulated by International law, and In
doing so did not violate any existing
rules, but only took into account the
peculiarity of this new weapon, the
submarine boat.
Neutral Movements Restricted.
"The use of the submarine natural
lv necessitated a restriction of the
free movement of neutrals and con
stituted a danger for them which
Germany Intended to ward off by a
special warning analogous to the
warning England had given regarding
the North sea.
"As both belligerents Germany in
her note of February 17 and Great
Britain in those of February IS and
20, 1915 claimed that their proceed
ing was only enacted in retaliation for
the violation of International law by
their opponent, the American govern
ment approached both parties for the
purpose of trying to re-establish In
ternational law as It had been In
force before the war. Germany was
asked to adapt the use of her new
weapon to the rules which had been
existing for the former naval wea
pons, and England not to interfere
with the food supplies intended for
the non-combatant German population
and to admit their distribution under
American supervision. Germany on
March 1, 1915, declared her willing
ness to comply with the proposal of
I he American government, whilst
England, on the other hand, declined
to do so. By the order In council,
March 11, 1915, Great Britain abolish
ed even what had remained of the
freedom of neutral trade with Ger
many and her neutral neighbors.
England's object was to starve Ger
many into submission by these illegal
means. . . t
Rights of Traders Not Limited.
"Germany, after neutral citizens
had lost their lives against the wish
and Intention, nevertheless In the
further course of the war, complied
with the wishes of the American gov
ernment regarding the use of her sub
marines. The rights of neutrals re
garding legal trading wero in fact no
whore limited by Germany.
England Arms Merchantmen.
"Then England made it impossible
for submarines to conform with the
old rules of International law by arm
ing nearly all her merchantmen and
by ordering the use of guns on mer
chant vessels for attack. Photograph
ic reproductions ot these instructions
have boon transmitted to neutral gov
ernments with the memorandum of
the German government of February
8, 1916. These orders aro obviously
in contradiction with the note deliv
ered by tho British ambassador in
Washington to the American govern
ment on October 25, 1914. On ac
count of the proposal mado by the
United States on January 23, 1916, re-'
gardlng disarmament, the Imperial I
government hoped that these facts
w.ould enable the neutral .governments i
to obtain the disarmament of the mer IH
chant ships of her opponents. The l
latter, however, continued with great
energy to arm their merchantmen VM
with guns. H
Armed For Attack. H
"The principle of the United States JM
government not to keep their citi- H
zens off belligerent merchant ships, H
has been used by Great Britain and H
her allies to arm merchant ships for H
offensive purposes. Under these clr- H
cumstances merchantmen can easily IH
destroy submarines, and if their at- IH
tack fails still consider themselves in IH
safety by the presence of American H
citizens off belligerent merchant WM
ships, has been used by Great Britain
and. her allies to arm merchant ships WM
for offensive purposes. Under these H
circumstances merchantmen can eas- H
ily destroy submarines, and if their H
attack fails still consider themselves jH
in safety by the presence of Amer- H
lean citizens on board. H
"The order to use arms on British H
merchantmen was supplemented by H
Instructions to masters of such ships JH
to hoist such flags and to ram jH
U-boats. Reports on payment of pre- H
nilums and bestowals of decorations l
to successful masters of merchant- l
men showing the effect of these or- i
ders. England's allies have also adopt- H
ed this position. I
Germany Facing Problems. H
"Now Germany is facing the follow- WM
ing facts: l
"(a) A blockade contrary to in- 11
ternatlonal law (compare American I
note to "England of November 5, 1915) fl
has for one year been keeping neutral Ki
trade from German ports and is mak- H
ing German exports impossible. I-H
'(b) For eighteen months through IH
the extending of contraband provi- I'H
slons in violation of international law IftH
(compare American note to England
of November 5, 1915) the overseas !
trade of neighboring neutral coun-
tries, so far as Germany Is concern- H
erf, lias been hammered. 7 I
"(c)The Interruption of ntfalls in H
violation of International law (com- M
pare American memorandum to Eng- M
land of January 10, 1916) is meant to H
stop any Intercourse of Germany with JH
foreign countries. ?H
"(d) England, by systematically jfH
and increasingly oppressing neutral jfl
countries, following the principle of IfH
'might before right,' has prevented WM
i neutral trade on land with Germany H
i so as to complete the blockade of the jH
I central powers intended to staYve H
their civil population. M
"(e)Germans met by our enemies B
on the high seas are deprived of their H
liberty, no matter whether they are jH
combatants or non-combatants. jl
'r) Our enemies have armed their IM
merchant vessels for offensive pur- WM
poses theoretically making it impos- H
sible to use our U-boats according to H
the principles set forth in the Lon- H
don Declaration (compare with Amer- H
ican memorandum of February S, H
1916). H
"Tho English white book of Jauu- H
ary 5, 1916, on the restriction of Ger- H
man trade boasts that by British H
measures Germany's export trade has H
been stopped almost entirely while tm
her imports are subject to England's H
, , i Jl
"The imperial government feels TH
confident that the people of the Unit- M
ed States, remembering the friendly iH
relations that for the last hundred H
vears have existed between the two JM
nations will, In spite of the dlfficul- fM
ties put in the way by our enemies, ijm
appreciate the German viewpoint as !H
laid down above." H

London, March 8, 3:11 p. m. Tho m
joint Anglo-French reply to the H
American note on the detention of H
