P1ACESBLAME
UPON BRITISH
BL0CKADEP1AN
Says Vessels Have Attacked
the Teutonic Sub
mersibles.
BERNSTORFF HANDS
LANSING MESSAGE
Points of View of Two Na
tions Appear to Differ
Greatly.
Washington, March 8.—Ambassa
dor von Bernatorff today handed Sec
retary Lansing a long memorandum
explaining in detail the German posi
tion In regard to armed merchant
ships, and causes leading up to the
decision of the central European pow
ers to torpedo without warning all
armed merchantmen of their ene
mies.
Both Secretary Lansing and Count
von Bernstorff declined to divulge its
contents. It is understood, however,
to contain the allegation that Great
Britain had taken advantage of the
contention of the United States that
Americans must be safe on defensive
ly armed merchantmen, to have those
ships act offensively toward the ene
mle's submersibles. The German gov
ernment, It is understood, concedes
that as submarines are a new engine
of warfare. International law as at
present const|tatad^-m«lMa.»-ao pro
vision for 'their use.
The German government is under"
stood to express willingness to oper
ate Its submarines in accordance with
the international law prevailing prior
to war, provided Great Britain do6s
not violate the same laws. It is also
understood that the memorandum
contends that the evidence appended
to the late German announcement
proves that British ships armed os
tensibly for defense, have been in
structed to act, and have acted offen
sively, and that they are not peaceful
traders, as the United States was as
sured they would be by Sir Cecil
Spring Rice, British ambassador. The
memorandum is also understood to
reiterate the previous declaration that
submarine warfare was begun by Ger
many in reprisal for the announced
intention of Great Britain to starve
the civilian population of the central
empires.
Look Friendship.
The memorandum Is also said to
refer to the long-standing friendship
of the United States and Germany,
and to express the hope that the
American people will, when familiar
with the explanations offered, fully
appreciate the position which Ger
many finds herself in as the result of
the blockade.
Secretary Tensing now has before
him the appendices to the announce
ment of the new German submarine
campaign, in which Germany contends
to prove that British merchant ships,
armed for defense, have been using
their guns offensively against sub
marines.
Views Differ.
On the eve of the decision of how
the United States will regard the new
campaign, the ambassador is instruct
ed to discuss the question fully with
Secretary Lansing, and outline Ber
lin's views at length.
Germany's proposition is that .the.
armed ship question is
.not. connected
with the Lusitanla negotiation, and
the state department's view is exactly
opposite. It is considered probable,
however, that the Lusitanla negotia
tion, which has been held in abey
ance while the congressional situation
Is disposed of, might be discussed
again today.
HEAVY VOTE

Indianapolis. Ind., March 8.—Re-,
turns from the first state-wide prefer
ential primary in Indiana were slow
in coming in, but those received up
at 10 O'clock last night indicated an
unusually heavy republican vote and
a falling off in the democratic and
progressive vote- A heavy republican
vote was due probably to the many
contests for nomination, while' there
were few contests for democratic
nominations and none for the pro

Churchill Tells How Navy
Must be Revived by Re
call of Fisher.
London, March 8.—Winston Spen
cer Churchill, former first lord of the
admiralty, now a colonel and fresh
from the trenches, sprang into
the parliamentary arena yesterday in
edaring speech, answering fflrst Lord
of.
jpalfoiwy .whp had
'just' presented ttvet vnaval.'estiifjftagfr
and declared, that the admiralty lack
«tfvdnvlfi£-fdrc« and must be tevital
ized before it waa too late by bringing
back Lord Fisher, the former first sea
lord, to head the admiralty adminis
tration.
Great interest attached to Colonel
Churchill's reappearance after a per
iod of silence while serving with the
army and while the naval policy he
had inaugurated at the beginning of
the war was undergoing considerable
change.
Balfour Optimistic.
Mr. Balfour had just concluded an
Optimistic statement of the naval out
look which strongly appealed to the
patriotic sentiment of the house of
commons, so that Colonel Churchill's
criticisms were at first coldly receiv
ed. But he gradually gathered atten
tion and applause until he closed amid
a scene of much enthusiasm-
German Navy Increased.
Colonel Churchill predicted that
since the outbreak of the war the Ger
man navy would be found to have
been greatly augmented, and he ex-.
pressed the hope that the British pro
gram of construction had been carried
out to the full requirement. He clearly
intimated, however, that it had not
been.
"Note of Warning."
He referred to his remarks as a
"jolly note of warning." which he said
had to be given. Since he had return
ed from the front he had received in
formation which was not entirely sat
isfying concerning the progress of
naval construction. Details must nec
essarily be ^avoided, but it could be
said that if every capital ship provid
ed for in the naval program the navy
could be ready with an ample margin I
of safety. It was within the power of
the admiralty to complete this pro
gram, but he expressed doubt as to
whether this could be done. Mean
while there was an impenetrable veil
over the German program.
"That is a grave fact/' said Colonel
Churchill, "for while we know noth
ing, yet we-may be sure something is
going on there."
BROWNELL IS PRESIDENT.
Tacoma, Wash.. March 8.—'The Ta

formerly was a representative of the

The vote of employes has been In

it is Bald more than 80 per cent of the

would mean a wage increase of ap

ORDERED TO ENFORCE
CLAIM OF $114,769
New York, March 8.—An order
signed in the federal district court
here yesterday authorized B. F. Bush,
receiver of the St. Louis, Iron Moun
tain and Southern Railroad company
to proceed at law to establish and
enforce a claim of~$ll4,769 as reim
bursement for expenditures in con
nection with improvements and equip
ment. The claim -is made against a
general fund of $892,648, held by a
New York trust company as trustee
under a unifying mortgage. The
court directed the railroad to join
With Bush in a suit against the trust
company and Walker Hill, also a
trustee of the mortgage. This order
is the outgrowth of, suits in equity
brought against the railroad.

DECLARE RECORD
IS EXCELLENT ONE
Question of Appointee Rec
ommendations Not a
Serious One.
Herald Special Service.)
Fargo, N, D., March s.—Supporters
of John Bruegger as a candidate for
re-election as national committeeman
for the democratic party in North Da
kota, fighting a combination of promi
nent democrats who are backing the
H. H. Perry candidacy for the posi
tion, look confidently to the outcome
of the balloting on March 21—insist
ing that Mr. Brti$gger's chance for
re-election is everything that, they
could wish for, and that they arc
practically certain of the retention, by
him, of his present post.
In a bulletin issued here and given
general circulation among the demo
cratic voters of the state, between 12.
000 and 15,000 of Whom are expected
to go to the polls-to vote on the com
mittee job, the Bruegger interests
take the opposition to task for state
ments made by the latter during the
campaign which has. in recent weeks,
taken on considerable heat-
Try to Belittle Record.
That his opponents are attempting
to belittle his record in the matter of
"turn downs" by the departments at
Washington, in the matter of postal
and other federal appointments, is
one charge made against the Perry
forces by Bruegger, and these he an
swers by the declaration that no na
tional committeeman in any state has
a record of receiving so many accept
ances of recommendations as has Mr.
Bruegger.
New evidence on the question of
McArthur's failure to land the Dost
of collector of customs is also set
forth, in the following manner:
"Relative to 'the1' appointment of
Mr, Morrison as .customs inspector,
the statements made are best an
swered in the words of Secretary Mc
Adoo, who stated, over his signature,
that none of the telegrams or pro
tests which were credited with pre
venting the appointment of Mr. Me
Arthur for this position had anything
to do with the action. Neither could
they have, for Mr,' McArthnr had no
application on,, filfe^oi^tbe position,

Is Not
"The rejection of Mr. Bruegger's
endorsement for this office or any of
fice cannot reasonably )e taken as
any evidence of liis influence or lack
of influence with the administration.
There is not a national committee
man in the country who has not 'had
similar experience.
"While a national committeeman
may recommend appointments, the
federal administration is not obliged
to accept them. However, since this
matter has been mentioned in an at
tempt to injure Mr. Bruegger, it is
fair to state that no national commit
teeman has ha.d a greater percentage
of his recommendations for office
recognized than has Mr. Bruegger."
Reference also is made to the ques
tion of previous elections, the opposi
tion attempting to use the vote of
four years ago as a basis for deter
mining the probable strength of Per
ry as against Bruegger.
La»t Election Figures.
It is shown that Bruegger receiv
ed 2,690 of the 10,219 votes cast, or
nearly one-third of the total. Puis,
now opposed to Rruegger. received 2,
503 votes, or about a fifth of the to
tal vote. Wilson received 1,821 Mc
Lean received 1.265 Perry received
I.461 Whitehead received 922. Mr.
Bruegger also points to the fact that
eight years ago he defeated George
Duis of Grand Forks in a race for the
senatorial nomination, receiving about
5,000 of the 8,901 votes polled.
Mr. Bruegger now maintains that
the latter vote is a more accurate
criterion of what his strength really

Approaches Taken.
The Germans thus far at the cost
of large losses, have obtained com
mand of approaches to the main
French positions beyond the west
bank of the Meuse river. The real
struggle will begin when the German
masses hurl themselves again on the
four miles of heights extending from
Bethincourt to Cumieres. Yesterday's
attacks left the battle unchanged. Cor

ceeded in establishing themselves,

and Goose Hills, as neither position

little strategic importance.
Men in Reserve.
It is known here that Germans set
aside 300,000 men to capture Verdun.
Only 200.000 having been employed
up to yesterday, it is question wheth
er the remaining 100.000 will be used
to make a sudden descent on some
other part of the French line in devel
oping an offensive against the fortress.
Frcnoh Satisfied.
A heavy attack west of the river,
however, leaves that question no long
er to be settled.
The impression of members of the
parliament, who are kept regularly
informed as to the progress of the
battle, is that the defense will be abl«
to resist all onslaughts the Germans
are able to make, and that Goose
Hill, on the left bank, will play a role
similar to Douaumont on the right.
It is expected the battle wiil reach
its climax tomorrow or Friday. Not
until then will it be possible to judge
which way the battle will go.
