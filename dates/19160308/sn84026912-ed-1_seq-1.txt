There is a Real Difference
Cream of tartar, derived from grapes,
is used in Royal Baking Powder because
it is the best and most healthful ingredient
known for the purpose. .
Phosphate and alum, which are de
rived from mineral sources, are used in
some baking powders, instead of cream of
tartar, because they are cheaper.
If you have been induced to use baking
powders made from alum or phosphate,
use Royal Baking Powder instead. You
will be pleased with the results and the
difference in the quality of the food.

Definite Information Wanted As to
Men mid Munitions.
Washington, March 5.-Tho War
Department, determined to be pre
pared for any eventuality, has order
ed a country-wide Inquiry to ascer
tain bow many men of military ex
perience would be available for com
m testons in tho army should their
services be needed. This Inquiry has
been directed 1)rat to all commission
ed officers who sow service in the
Spanish war. Each has boon asked
whether he can bo depended to re
turn to the colors should bis coun
try call him.
In addition', inquiries have been
sent to nil of those who Informally j
offered their services to the United
States when the Mexican situation
was most acute about two years ago.
At 'that time the War Department
looked up and listed a vast number
of engineers and other technical ex
perts whose services would be inval
uable in war. To all the inquiry bas
been renewed and each has been
asked to inform tho War Depart
ment whether the tender of services
made in tho former Mexican crisis
holds good at present.
As a further means of increasing
the commissioned personnel of the
ttt'iny, should need arise, the depart
ment is making a very careful study
ol' the lists ol those attending the
students' military camp and the
business men's 'in I Ht airy camps, nota
bly that held at Plattsburg, N. Y.,
last year. The ratings attained by
all of those participants are being
gone over to show just how many
and what character of officers could
be commissioned from this source.
The other roliunce of the War De
partment outside of the regular army
is the organized militia and adju
tants general of the various States
will report just what could bo ex
pected from their organizations by
way of officers and enlisted men.
To completo this tactical peace
mobilization tho experts of the quar
termaster's corps of the annoy of the
Ordnance Department are agnin list
ing tho various manufacturing plants
of the country, to know what their
output of munitions and war sup
plies probably would be. Last year
former Secret*ry Garrison directed
that such an inquiry be made. To
get this phase of the work further in
hand the Commerce and Treasury
Departments have boen asked for
the figures showing juBt what tho ex
ports ol' munitions and other war
supplies lo. the European belliger
ents have been. From these reports
it would be possible to deduce just
what the total American output
would be should the United States
need its war products to light its
own battles.
