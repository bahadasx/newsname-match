HYDE PRK, VERMONT, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 8,
AGIN' THE PERRY BILL
Morristown Wants Local Option
and Direct Primaries. Vote
$2.00 Tax and It Must
Suffice
About the usual number of voters at
tended town meeting in Morrisville yes
terday, when the twenty-odd articles of
tbe warning were disposed of in a man
ner that reflected credit upon the offieers
in charge and the voters as a body. Not
withstanding the interest in the Perry
bill and the primary act, the voters had
evidently considered the other matters of
importance and much intelligent discus
sion was the result.
The town voted to raise $1000 to take
advantage of the state aid law for high
wavs. It was also voted to raise such
proportional part of $1200 as the
Grand List of tbe town bears to the
Grand List of tbe county, for the em
ployment of a Government-County Agri
cultural Advisor. This article brought
out a spirited discussion, being favored
by Harold Ryder, Arthur Hollis, George
Terrill, W. S. Newcomb, C. F. Smith and
Julius Mudgett, and opposed by Martin
Carleton and Levi S. Small. It was car
by a vote of 94 to 79.
A tax of $2 00 on a dollar of the Grand
List was voted, apportioned practically
as reiommended by the Auditors. The
motion of Ed Crowell for a tax of $1.80
was amended by L. S. Small to read
$3 00, and after a lengthy discussion, in
which C. H. A. Stafford. H. A. Slay ton
and others favored the amendment, it
was voted practically unanimous. The
tax is subject to the usual discount if
paid on or beiore Nov. 1.
Upon motion of Mr. Stafford, which
was unanimously voted, theofficers were
instructed to limit their expenditures to
the amount of money voted for each de
partment aud the town treasurer was
instructed to refuse payment of any or
ders drawn in excess of these amounts.
Morristown voted agiinst the Perry
bill. The vote was 207 to 185. Tbe
direct primary wrs carried by a vote of
269 to 98. The town license question
was a victory for no license by a vote o
252 to 127.
The meeting was called to order by
Moderator T. C. Cheney, who was
unanimously re-elected. A. A. Niles was
elected Town Clerk and Treasurer with
out opposition.
The Selectmen were empowered to ap
point one or two Road Commissioners
as they may deem wise.
Under articles nine and 10, C. A. Slay ton
reported that tbe New School Building
Committee was unable to report and
made a motion that the articles be passed
over and the committee be retained in
office. It was so voted.

Death of Miss Hettie Sternberg
, The many friends of Miss Hester A.
Sternberg were saddened to learn of her
death, which occurred at her home on
Maple street at nine o'clock last Friday
night, following a long period of ill
health. She had been failing quite rap
idly since last December and had been
confined. to her bed for the past four
weeks. Death was due to chronic val
vular heart trouble and hardening of the
arteries.
The funeral was held Monday after
noon at two o'clock from the Methodist
Lpiscopal church, Rev. W. T. Best offici
ating. . The bearers were H. Waite, A. R
Campbell, George H. Terrill and D. P
Smith. Interment was in Pleasant View
cemetery.
The deceased was one of the several
children of Peter and Rachel Benjamin
Sternberg and was born in DeKalb.N.Y.,
Nov. 27, 1842. She spent her early life
in West Stockholm and Canton, N. Y.,
moving to Morrisville 33 years ago to
make her home with her sister, Mrs.
Emma J. Marvin, with whom she had
since resided. She was a conscientious
christian woman of strong convictions
and high ideals and bad for many years
been an active member of the Methodist
church and the W. C. T. U., in Morris-
ville. Besides her sister, Miss Sternberg
is survived by two nephews and one
niece. A sister-in-law, Mrs. W. B. Stern
berg of Greensboro Bend, assisted in her
care during the last three weeks of her
life. Although a great sufferer for the
past six months, she was patient and
thoughtful of others, which was a strong
characteristic of her life.
The Court of Fame
You have all read of Samantha Allen's
adventures in company with Josiah in
the great places of the world, and you
surely will not want to miss her trip
to "The Court of Fame" in search of
a crown offered to the most famous
woman. Smantha has a great deal to
say, as usual, but she has a great deal of
competition in her efforts to "am that
crown." Stately queens in court robes,
pretty dancing girls in fluffy gowns,
Topsy in her miscellaneous collection
of raiment, sweet Nydia, the blind girl of
Pompeii, Grace Parling, the English her
iiine, Mrs. Partington -and her precious
nephew, Ike, with many others, all come
to vie with each other. Come and get
acquainted anew with these old friends,
and learn who really does get the crown.
