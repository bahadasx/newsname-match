NIAGARA. FAULS, N. Y., March 8.—
While one man was known to be dead
and a score were missing, the entire
city Are department fought today to
save the N-lagara Alkali Chemical
company's big plant here. The fire
started shortly before midnight with
|ta terrific explosion that rocked the
entire city as by an earthquake.
Other explosions of even greater
violence, to the number of twelve or
fifteen, followed and the peroxide
plant was literally blown to atoms.
The peroxide plant In which the ex
plosions occurred, contains apparatus
for the manufacture of a large per
cent of the chloroform usfd in the
United States.
Officials of the company would give
no. estimate of the number of men in
the building at the time. Several
guards asserted that of the number,
variously estimated at from 75 to 136,
the escape of the men was miracuolous
owing to the gaseous nature of the
product.
Firemen and police stood by help
less to render any aid to those in
side. both on account oi! the Intense
heat
and
danger of explosions which
extended over a period of five hours.
The plant manufactures nitrates as a
bi-product, which is delivered to the
various powder companies working on
war orders. It is also understood they
have immense direct war orders.
Enormous quantities of peroxide
of hydrogen are also manufactured
there.
The building of brick and steel con
struction, about 800 by 75 feet In di
mensions, was completely demolished.
The first explosion shot the roof with
its massive girders fully 100 feet In
the air and landed it several hundred
feet away In another section of the
plant's yard.
A string of freight cars, standing on
a siding two blocks away, was bowled
over while one of the huge electric
hauling locomotives of the Niagara
Junction railway,' was completely de
molished.
Steel tanks of twenty by fifteen feet
dimensions were shot through a three
foot brick wnll like projectiles and
sunk In the Niagara river, some 100
yards distant.
Machinery of every description lies
heaped in tangled and twisted masses
in various parts of tHe yard.
Eight More.
NIAGARA FALIjS, N. Y., March 8.—
Shortly after 9 a. m. a series of eight
explosions again rocked the plant of
the Niagara Alkali company and de
veloped a new fire which was eating
Its way toward the storage house.

In the building at the time have been

Only One Known Dead.
NIAGARA FALLS, N. Y., March 8.
—Niagara Falls was shaken and a
large part of the huge plant of the
Niagara Electro-Chemical company,
was demolished by a Becond series
of terrific explosions and fire early
today. Though guards said from 76
to 135 men were in the plant, only
one man is known to have been killed
and one seriously Injured.
An official of the company said he
did not believe the explosion was an
accident.
The first explosion followed an out
break of fire shortly before midnight
and others occurred intermittently
until shortly after 9 a. m„ when
eight blasts of tremendous force,
shattered the shell of the burning
plant and scattered twisted flaming
debris over a wide area. Firemen
concentrated their efforts on saving
the storage house, said to contain
high explosives.
The room In which the explosives
are stored is separated from the burn
ing building by a thick fire wall, but
the doors have burned through and
an explosion clwarfing all earlier ones
was momentarily expected.
Dr. H. R. Carvath, works manager,
was preparing a statement regarding
the fire when the new danger devel
oped and he was forced to abandon it.
Officials and firemen crouched be
hind other buildings, powerless to
throw water on the flames.

These charges are denied in Eng
land's note given Ambassador Page.
That the only eye-witness advanced
is discredited by not having been at

claimed by England. The British note
courts fullest investigation and an

I The British note was interpreted by

stantiatlng the expectation that Eng

Fisher to his former poet.
In some quarters it was suggested
that Lord Fisher had been summoned

with those expressed by Churchill,
Others saw In Lord Fisher's attend

LONDON, March 8.—French troops
holding the village of Regnevllle, sev

most two-thirds surrounded- by the
Germans. They may be forced to
evacuate before many hours.
Paris reported today the teutons
shelling Regnevllle with the greatest
violence from their newly won posi
tions on the east bank of the Meuse.
Under cover of a heavy bombardment,
the Germans were making repeated
efforts to bridge the river in the loop
south of Regneville.
The German division that stormed
Hill 265 on the northeastern spur of
Goose Hill has made several weak at
tacks against French positions higher
on the slopes. Artillery Is being
brought up in preparation for a heavy
assault against Goose Hill and Dead
Man Hill to the east.
On the east bank of the Meuse, the
German guns directed a heavy can
nonade against the French front yes
terday afternoon. Paris expects a re
newal of the crown prince's onslaughts
against General Petain's center at
Douaumont, with other German
thrusts from the region of Fresnes.

might well be worth the cost.
"The German advance through
Forges would be unimportant if it had

whether it is not the prelude to very

there need be no anxiety. The French

an attack west of the Meuse."
Berlin dispatches today were
strangely silent on this important

chiefly with the preparations for a
renewal of the heavy artillery attack

flUnited Press Leased Wire Servloel'
YOUiNGSTOWN, Ohio, March 8.—
Judge Mbert H. Gexy, president of
the United States Steel corporation,
and six large steel companies, were
indicted by the Mahoning county
grand Jury today, charged with viola
tion of the Valentine anti-trust act
(an Ohio law) and with conspiring to
keep down the wages of common la
borers.
Tho following East Youngstown
steel companies were indicted:
The Youngstown Sheet and Tube
company, The Republic Iron Se Steel
Co., The Briar Hill Steel Co., Tbe
Youngstown Iron and Steel Oo., The
United States Steel corporation, The
Carnegie Steel Co.
The indictments grew out of the
Bast Youngstown riots of January Y,
In which foi^r lives were lost, thirty
seven persons injured and property
damage of $1,000,000 sustained. The
grand jury, after thoroughly probing
the strike and its causes, returned the
indiotments.
The grand jury charged specifically
that section 6390 of the Ohio statutes
was violated, in that tho steel com
panies combined to keep down the
wages of common laborers.
There are sixty-two counts in the in
dictment against Gary and the steel
companies.
In a report on the strike and riot,
the grand jury censured Mayor W. H.
Cunningham aand the police force of
East Youngstown. The report said
Cunningham and the police force of
"Inefficient" and "unworthy to hold
office."
The grand jury held that no foreign
government was responsible for the
strike of steel workers.
Tho grand Jury today also returned
indictments against Mayor W. H. Cun
ningham of Bast Youngstown and sli
members of the village council on

The grand Jury report says that
the evidence obtained from "512 wit
nesses who were examined in the thir
ty-nine days probe, will show a lawless
condition of affairs in and about tho
steel industry, hut will also indicate
an absolute disregard on the part of
certain corporations and individuals
indicted by us, either of the rights of.
or justice to, tho laboring class or of
the public generally."

"While one shot was fired from one

of the tube company, the shots whloh
precipitated the excitement, aots at

mitted January 17. shots were fired by
guards of Youngstown Sheet and Tifb«
Oo. We have 'been unable to find any
direct connection of any foreign gov

rioters to commit various aots of
crime.
"We find there Is an underlying
cause that of not only the strike, but
the dissatisfaction prevailing among
the men prior to strike, but of riots it
self, a cause which will be shown up
on the trial of some of the corpora
tlons and Individuals against whom
charges have been made by this jury."
The report states there was dissatis
faction among the better paid work
ers of the steel companies as well as
among the common laborers who went
on strike.
If convicted. Judge Gary may be
sentenced to a maximum of one year's
imprisonment in the workhouse for
each of the sixty-two alleged offenses
and could be fined a maximum of $S,

offense is a ISO fine and six months In
the work house.
According to A. M. Henderson, pros
ecuting attorney, efforts will be made
at the trial of the cases to show that
the alleged combination to fix the
price of labor by Gary and the steel
companies, brought about the unrest
among the laborers which resulted In
the strike and riots.
