GERMANY SUBMITS
NEW MEMORANDUM
ON SUBMARINE WAS
i
Note From Berlin Handed Secretary
Lansinq by Ambas
sador Bernstorff.
PUTS BLAME ON BRITAIN
FOR EXISTING CONDITIONS
Says Orders to Captains of Merchantmen
Are Responsible for
Methods Now in Force.
MAKES CONDITIONAL PROMISE
Is Willing to Comply With Law Prevailing
Before the War if Eng
iHna consents IU uo
Likewise.
The German government, in a
memorandum handed today by
Count von Bernstorff to Secreiarv
Lansing, outlines in detail
its position in regard to armed
ships, reviews events leading up
t" its decision to torpedo without
warning all armed merchantmen
of its enemies, concedes thaj international
law. as at present
constituted, makes no provision
tor the use of submarines, and
expresses a willingness to operate
its submarines in accordance with
international law prevailing prior
to the war on the condition that
Great Britain does not violate the
same laws.
lext or the statement.
The text of the memorandum follows:
"The imperial German government, on
account of the friendly relations which
hava always existed between the two
great nations, and earnestly desiring1 to
continue them, wishes to explain the
U-boat question once more to the
American government.
"At the outbreak of the war the German
government, acting' upon the suggestion
of the United States, immediately
expressed its readiness to ratify
the declaration of London. At rh;t
time a German prize code had alrea
been issued, which was entirely, at;.,
without modification, based upon the
rules of the declaration of London. Germany
thereby proved her willingness to
recognize fully the existing rules of international
law which insures the freedom
of the seas for the legitimate trade
of neutral nations not only among
themselves, but also with belligerent
countries.
Action of Great Britain.
"Great Britain, on the other hand, declined
to ratify the declaration of lx>ndon.
and after the outbreak of the war
began to restrict the legitimate trade
of the neutrals in order to hit Germany.
The contraband provisions were
systematically. extended August 20.
September 21 and October 29. 1914. November
3. 1914. the order of ihe British
admiralty followed. declaring the
whole North sea a war zone in which
commercial shipping would be exposed
to the most serious danger from mines
and men-of-war.
"Protests from neutrals were of no
a\ail ami frmii that t imo .... ti... rr,.<.
doni of neutral commerce with Germatiy
was practically destroyed. Under
th*?: e circumstance:* (iermany was
compelled to resort, in February. 1915.
to reprisals in . order lo fight her
opponents' measures which were
absolutely contrary to international
law She chose for this purpose a newweapon
the use of which had not yet
been regulated by international law
and. in doing so. could and did not
\lolate any existing rules, but only
took into account the peculiarity of
this new" weapon, the submarine boat.
'The use of the submarine naturally
necessitated a restriction of the free
nio\ement of neutrals and constituted
a danger for them which (iermany intended
to ward off by a special warning
analogous to the warning Kngiand
had given regarding the North sea.
British Orders in Council.
"As both belligerents?Germany in
her note of February 17 and Great
Britain in those of February 18 and 20,
1315?claimed that their proceeding
waa only enacted in retaliation for the
violation of international law by their
opponent, the American government
approached both parties for the purpose
of trying to re-establish international
law as it had been in force he.
fore the war.
"tier many was asked to adapt the
use of her new weapon to the rules
which had been existing for the former
naval weapons, and England not to
interfere with the food supplies Intended
for the non-combatant German
population, arid to admit their distribution
under American supervision.
Germany, March 1, 191 ' >. declared her
willingness to corripl;. "With the proposal
of the American government,
while Kngland. on the other- ho-..?
dined to do ^o.
"By the order iti council March 11,

what had remained of the freedom of
neutral trade with Germany and her
neutral neighbors. England's object
was to starve Germany into submission
b> these illegal means.
"Germany, after neutral citizens had
lost their lives against the wish and
intention, nevertheless, in the further
course of the war. complied with the
wishes of the American government regarding
the use of her submarines. The
rights of neutrals regarding legal trading
were in fact nowhere limited by
Germany.
Puts Blame on England.
"Then England made it impossible
for submarines to conform with the old
rules of international law bv arming
nearly all merchantmen and by ordering
the use of guns on merchant \es

Everything is in readiness for the
j new Secretary at the War Department,
with full expectation of his formal in?
duction into office tomorrow morning.
A few days after Mr. CJarrison resigned
the War portfolio and had returned to
his home in New Jersey he indicated
I his intention of coming hark to Wash
ingtori for the purpose of assisting: in
the induction of his successor by introducing:
him to the heads of the various
military bureaus of the War Department
and giving any information
regarding unfinished business of im!
portance that rnifcht be desired. He
asked to be informed when his successor
was to be installed in office, so
that he might arrange his affairs accordingly.
Owing to doubt at the War
Department as to the actual date when
Mr. Baker will take hold it has been
impossible so far to inform Mr. Garrison
on that point.
In case it is arranged that Mr. Baker
shall be installed tomorrow morning
Maj. Gen. Hu?h L. Scott, chief of staff.

Armed by the Senate late yesterday
I afternoon. The nomination was sent
j to the Senate a few hours earlier by
| he President.
Opponents of the administration at,
tempted yesterday to make trouble for
| Mr. Baker by quoting frpm a telegram
which Senator Potnerene of Ohio received
from him when there was loud
talk of a rebellion in the House against
the President's policy regarding armed
merchantmen. They quoted from the
j telegram as follows:
"Cannot something be done to save
the party, which at present is a dismal
failure."
The full text of the message, however,
puts a very different light upon
the matter. It reads:
"Opinion here is wholly with the
President. He will doubtless save the
; honor of the country, but cannot somej
thing be done to save the party, which
seems to be a dismal failure."
When Telegram Was Sent.
Mr. Baker's friends immediately called
attention to the fact that the telegram
was sent at a time when many of the
democrats in the Senate and House were
making "a dismal failure of the party"
by opposing the President's submarine
policy.
Ix n? rtnu-i?i ci?*icomrnmee yesterday

and returned to work Monday
night met officials of the local
street railway companies this
morning for a series of conferences
which, it is believed, will
aajust an grievances ot the employes.
The meetings were held
at company offices. It was announceed
that no details of the
conferences will be made public
until they have been concluded.
It was said, however, that the
conferences are being conducted
in the best spirit of conciliation,
which, it is believed, will make
for eventual success.
Those in Conferences.
The committee of employes of the
Washington Railway and Electric
Company, comprising George A. WilbijM.
H. E. Jones and F. M. Thompson,
met at the offices of that company on

Following the conference between the
employers and employes, Mr. Hamilton,
Mr. King: and Mr. Hanna appeared at
the District building and had a brief
talk with Commissioner Newman. It
was said at the District building that
the railway officials appeared at the
Commissioners' office simply to discuss
minor details of the procedure of the
conferences, and that their call was not
related to the subject of the conferences.
To Continue Three Days.
The conferences adjourned for luncheon
and were resumed at an early hour
at the companies' offices this afternoon.
It is expected that they will continue
for three days, concluding Friday, under
the agreement which brought them
about. Questions such as the reinstatement
of the men who were discharged
by the companies since February
13, because, the men charged,
they had joined the union, are being
thrashed out in the conferences, as well
as the possibility of a. readjustment of
working hours and wage scales, the instruction
of new motormen and conductors,
the right of the men to
choose their "runs" according to
seniority in service, etc.
It was provided in the agreement
which brought about the conferences
that if they are not-successful in clearing
up the grievances of the men at the
end of three days, which period will
expire Friday, arbitrators are to be
chosen to settle remaining disputed
points, but the opinion prevailed today
in all quarters that the company officials
will be able to straighten out their
differences with their employes without
resort to arbitration. After an agreement
is made between the conferees it
will be subject to approval by the conductors
and motormen as a body, and a
contract for one year is to be made be
iween trie employes and the companies.

were passed around and soon officials
and employes were assuring one another

FOR BIG NIAGARA FIRE
Explosions and Flames Threaten
Complete Destruction of Chem- j
ical Concern. >
NIAGARA FALLS, N. Y.. March
Fire following; an explosion in the
chlorate department of the Niagara
Electric Chemical Company today
threatened to complete the destruction*
of the plant, hegun last night,
when several explosions and the resultant
fires inflicted damage estimated !
at $150,000.
The explosion was heard for several
miles around, and across the Niagara
cataract in Canada, where it caused a
hasty mobilization of the militia guarding
the frontier. The police roped off
the streets in the vicinity of the chemical
plant as the fire was driven toward 1
chemicals of a high explosive nature.!
The fireman were helpless to cope with j
the spreading fire because water mix-ing
with the chemicals only added fuel
to the flames.
Says Plant Was Bombed.
Dr. Hector B. Carrath. manager of the
company, issued a formal statement today.
saying the plant had been
"bombed."
"I am convinced," he said, "that the
explosion in our plant was the result of
outside agencies. Careful investigation
has shown us the first explosion was)
not such as would have occurred had i
chemicals stored in our buildings let go.
"I believe a bomb with only a small i
amount of explosive was set off just inside
the peroxidal plant, the slight ex
plosion that followed giving; most of
the employes a chance to escape. The
second explosion was also caused by a
bomb, but those that followed were
those of the stores of chemicals in the
plant."
No one was injured by the explosion
today, but one man was killed and another
badly injured by the explosion
last night.

Youngstown Companies Are
Charged With Conspiring to
Fix Laborers' Pay.
JUDGE E. H. GARY AMONG
THE BIG MEN MENTIONED
Mayor and Six Councilmen Also Accused
by Grand Jury of Being
Implicated.
YOLtN(jSTO\VN, Ohio, March
8.?Indictments were returned
today by the Mahoning county
grand jury against the Youngstown

Company, the Youngstown Iron
and Steel Company, the Carnegie
Steel Company, the Ctiited States

Meel company ana juage r.. 11.
Gary, executive chairman of the
L'nited States Steel Company.
The defendants are charged
with having formed a trust to fix
the wages of common labor in
violation of the laws of Ohio.
These indictments followed a
sweeping investigation of the
East Youngstown riots and labor
troubles of January.
The specific offense charged against
the six steel concerns is that they conspired
to keep the wages of common
labor at the same figuraat the time of
the stride at the Reqftblic Iron and
Steel Company and the Youngstown
Sheet and Tube Company in January.
Announcement was made by all these
companies within two days' time of a
10 per cent increase in wages. This action
is held to be due to an agreement.
Mayor and Councilmen Indicted.
I
Indictments were also returned |
against Mayor W. H. Cunningham and
six councilmen of East Youngstown,
charging them with being financially
nterested in property purchased for
tillage purposes.
The jury report sets forth that the
grand jury was unable to fix any paricular
cause for the recent East
foungstown reign of anarchy. The re- j
jort flays Mayor W. H. Cunningham
md members of the East Youngstown
>olice force, saying that neithe** the
nayor nOr any member of the police
orce made an effort whatever to disterse
the mob.
Mayor Cunningham is criticised for
lot closing the saloons of East Youngsown
early on Friday morning after he
lad received notice of the temper of
he mob. The report says that the
nayor and police officers of East
"oungstowm were guilty of such ineftiiency
and disregard for the law as to
?e unfit and unworthy to fill the posiions
which they hold.
Charge Illegal Use of Militia.
The report recites tlie fact that a
:uard at the Youngstown Sheet and
*uhe Company who is a member of
he state militia, without legal authortv
took ten members of the National
iuard to the Sheet and Tube Company's
roperty to guard the same..
It is also stated that the guard apropriated
state ammunition, although
he grand jurors say that- Miev do not
tun it ion. It is set forth that the acion
of the guard made it impossible
or the sheriff or the captain of the
lilitia to mobilize militiamen in :me
f grave public danger.
Guards on the Sheet and Tube Comany
bridge, who fired into the crowd
ssembled about the time office before
he rioting began, are censured. The
eport says that the guards were not of j
he standard to be trusted with such a i
esponsible duty. The report goes on
o say that the grand jury was unable
d find that the influence of any foreign
overnment was responsible for the
iot. The alleged combination of manuacturers
with the intent to keep down
he wages of common labor is criticised.
