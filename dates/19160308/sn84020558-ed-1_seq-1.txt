EL PASO, March 7. Officers of the
Thirteenth L'nited States Cavalry,
patrolling the New Mexico border, re
ported tonight that Francisco Villa was
at the Uosques Grandes ranch, in miles
west of Palomas, Chihuahua, opposite
Columbus, N. M. Villa, the report
stated, had with him between 200 and
300 men".
United Statts military authorities
maintained heavy patrols all along the
border tonight.
Charles Newman, El Paso repre
sentative of the Palomas Land and
Cattle company, was today notified
that Arthur McKinney, ranch foreman,
and fourteen Mexican employes of the
company had been taken prisoners by
Vjlla and his followers.
The men, it was said, were captured
at a point directly adjoining the Bas
ques ranch and 35 miles south of the
border. The ranch employes were en
gaged in rounding up and branding
cattle.
American army officers said their
information gave no intimation of
Villa's intention.
His presence close to the border
gave rise to widely variant surmises
as to his plans.
Andreas Garcia. Mexican consul
here, declared that Carranza military
commanders were making disposi
tions to force the rebel leader to ac
cept terms or take refuge in the
l'nited States. There were no indica
tions, however, of Mexican govern
ment troops in the vicinity of Villa's
encampment.
General Gabriel Gavira. eommand
nnt at Juarez, did not appear at his
headquarters today. He was said to
be slightly indisposed, but reports
were current that he had proceeded
westward in connection with plans
to capture the bandit chieftain or
T
compel him to cross the international progress of naval construction. De
boundarv. .tails must necessarily lie avoided, but
The report circulated here concern-
ing Villa's intentions was that he had
come to the border to get in touch
with representatives of the Diaz rev-
olutionary movement, and to be in '
better position to recruit his force
and gather supplies through filibus-
ters from the l'nited States.

fantrv Attacks
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Driving hard against the French line
northwest and southeast of Verdun, the
Germans have been enabled to make
additional gains toward Verdun, but
with extremely heavy casualties, ac
cording to Paris. Hill No. -f't to the
southeast and a portion of Corbeaux
wood, directly south of Forges, have
been occupied by the Germans through
strong infantry attacks that were pre
ceded by extremely heavy bombard
ments. The town of Fresnes in the
Woevre also has been captured.
The German attack was over the en
tire front west of the Meuse, extending
from Bethincourt to the river, but ex
cept in the Corbcitux wood and at Hill
No. l!6r the French held back the at-
tackers at all points. Thus the French
still occupy the important strategic po
sition on the heights of the Cote De
L'Oie for the possession of which many
sanguinary engagements have been
fought.
The occupation of a portion of the
Corbeaux wood would indicate that the
Germans have advanced over three
miles since they took the town of
Forges.
The Germans succeeded in penetrat
ing a French redoubt in the region of

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, March 7. Presi
dent Wilson ttalay completely and de
cisively won his long fight to com
pel congress to describe its stand be

The celebrated MImore resolu
Vn,r,. around which the anti-adminis
tration force centered their fight, was
tabled in other winds killed just
as wns the Gore resolution for a sim
ilar purpose in the senate Inst week.
From the outset of the fight t"
dav the president's supporters swept
over the oposition without regard to

on the first vote, whith was a pre

amendment and unlimiateil debute,
the administration foices carried the
day 2T.fi to ICO. On that 1VJ demo

ministration. Twenty-one democrats,
132 republicans, five progressives, one
independent and Representative Lon
don, the lone socialist of the house,
voied against it.
This was the crucial vote of the
fight, the ine point on which admin
istration leaders were uncertain,
with victory in hand, they moved on
to the next proposition, the adoption
of a special rule for four hours dis
cussion of the McLtmore resolution.
Again they carried the day, this

victory to a conclusion by tabling the
McLemore i esolution.276 to 142.

Germany Exhausts Efforts
To Retain Our Friendship
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
NEW YORK, March 7. The gen
eral feeling among many noted men
in Germany is that the government
there had exhausted all efforts to re
tain America's friendship and can do
rjothing further, according to Roy S.
MacKlwee,' secretary to the American
consul-general in Berlin, who arrived
here today on the Norwegian-American
liner Kristianiafjord. Mr. Mac
Klwee has returned to visit relatives
and will go to Washington on offi
cial business.
The military and naval strength of
the l'nited States is not seriously
tions with the central powers.
The next step probably will be an
answer to Germany's last proposal
to settle the Lusitania case, in which
the l'nited States probably will ask
for such further assurances as it
considers sufficiently broad and com
plete, to guarantee that the new sub
marine campaign which began on
March i and in which notice has
been given that all ships carrying
guns will be sunk without warning,
will not endanger Americans travel
ing the seas on merchant vessels.
The president and his advisers re
garded the action of the house today
as a sufficient answer to reports
circulated in Rerlin, sen from Wash
ington, that congress stood two to
one against him in the crisis.
One of the day's surprises was the
failure of the so-called Bryan in
fluence to develop any appreciable
strength against the president.
"Stand by the president and do not
embarrass him in his diplomatic ne
gotiations with foreign countircs
was the whole burden of the argu
ment of the administration leaders.
They paid little attention to the in
volved legal phases of the situation.
It was enough, they argued, that the
piesident had said the reported atti
tude of t-ongress as oposed to his
policy was embarrassing him abroad,
and fo that they stuck.
Tributes were paid to the president
by almost all the democratic speak
ers, from Acting Chairman f'ou of
the rules committee, who opened the
debate, to Chairman Flood of the
foreign affairs committee, who closed
it. To a man they insisted the pres
ident did not want war. No one at
tempted, as was the case in the sen
ale last week, to say that anything
the president had said indicated that
he expected war.
'It is charged that the president
wants war," said Mr. Pou "All the
imps of hell never devised a more
infamous charge. No man since
Abraham Lincoln hat; gone through
such a tost as t lie president in the
last six months to avoid war. He
has tried to preserve peace. He
would not sacrifice a single life to
make himself president for his life
time.'
Mr. Flood pleaded that the president
be supported in his attempts to uphold
international law.
- it we yield to Germany," he said,
"we will have to yieldto the allies, and
the whole fabric of international law
will crumble, piece by piece. We can
not yield to Germany without admit
ting that the awful crime of the sink
ing of the Lusitania was justified. The
only course to pursue is to stand up
strongly for international law. This
the president has done, and done in
such a way as to serve the rights and
principles of humanity."
Opponents of the administration
made much of the proposal by Secre
tary Lansing to the entente allies on
January IS in which he said he thought
the right to arm merchantmen was of
doubtful legality. TUcy insisted that
the whole controversy with Germany
hinged on that. Mr. Flood's answer
was that the allies had declined to
agree to the suggestion that they dis
arm merehantment, and therefore the
whole issue stood as it did before Sec
retary Lansing wrote his memorandum.

In his confession, the police say,
Groman also implicates his father
and another sister, both of whom re

street, about noon on October 25.
i'f last year, was of incendiary origin.
The house in question, owned by

Elvvee.
"Germans feel." he asserted, "that
there is a manifest moral svmpathv
in the l'nited States with the entente
allies, and this is going to prolong
the war in that Germans believe the
allies feel that they have the United
States to call upon in case of neces
sity. Germans think that but for
this American sympathy peace would
now be possible, inasmuch as Ger
many's enemies would be willing to
get together around the table if they
did not feel they . had the l'nited
States to fail back upon. At the
same time Germany is confident of
victory."

German Version Contrary

Hands
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON, March 7. The British re
ply to the German note sent through
the American embassy at Berlin in the
middle of January rejecting the Brit
ish government's offer for an investiga
tion of the Baralong case by a court
composed of American naval officers
and announcing German's intention to
adopt measures of reprisal was issued
tonight. It is for transmission to Am
bassador Gerard at Berlin through
Walter Hines Page, the American am
bassador in London.
The Baralong, a British patrol boat,
last fall sank a German submarine and
allegations were made that men from
the Baralong afterwards killed mem
bers of the German submarine crew
while they were in the water or on
board the American steamer Nicosian,
which had picked them up.
The British government disclaims
any intention to further discuss its
general charges of the inhumanity of
Germany's sea wrarfare which it holds
have been amply proved. Commenting
on Germany's statement that her of
ficers had been acquitted of all blame
after a thorough examination in the
three cases which Great Britain asked
Germany to refer with the Baralong
case to an American naval board the
sinking of the White Star liner Arabic,
the destruction of a stranded British
submarine by a German destroyer and
the German submarine attack on the
British steamship Ruel the note says
the German version of the sinking of
the Arabic not only is improbable but
directly contrary to all evidence tho
British government possesses, from a
large number of independent and
trustworthy witnesses.
" What is the counter evidence on
which the German government re
lies?" says the note.
"Has the captain of the submarine
been tried for murder'.' Has he even
been accused of any deed which in
German eyes is not meritorious? If
as His Majesty's government believe,
he sank the Arabic without warning,
do the German government so far
agree with the rest of the world as to
treat that action as a crime? If they
do, why should they hesitate to con
demn the sinking of the Lusitania? If
they do no, why investigate the case
of the Arabic?"

to $S00 was carried In the Arizona
Fire Insurance Company by Rosa
Groman, who made a claim for the
entire amount following the fire, in
surance amounting to something
more than $1,000 was carried on the
house by the owner of the structure.
Before the insurance had been paid
tended that the fire had been caused
by the explosion of a gasoline range.
Investigation showed that there had
been no explosion and that there
could not have been a leak of gaso
line as both supply cocks were closed
tightly.
While the local investigation was
in progress the Gromans were iden
tified by a merchant as having been
implicated in questionable fires in
the northwest. That same evening
ihe entire family left town. They
were traced to Los Angeles, where
the father and daughter Rosa are
said to be living, soon after leaving
here, Mary Groman married August
Mundt and they removed to Oakland
accompanied by Reinhardt Groman.
On February 17 the Mundt home was
burned and suspicion- was at once
aroused.
So far no formal charge had been
lodged locally against any of the
Gromans, but detectives in the em
ploy of the insurance underwriters
have constantly had them under sur
veillance. In view of the alleged
confession of young Groman. it is
expected that as soon ns the facts are
received here that Adjuster McKin
ley will file a formal charge of ar
son and ask the return here of at
least two of the members of the
Oroman family to stand trial here on
an arson charge.
