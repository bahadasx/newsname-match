1'AttIS, March 8.?in the Champagne! n
the French have recaptured portions n
of the trenches lost oil Mafch 6, oc- - a
cording to semi-official announcement! c
i made here today.
The situation north of Verdun is i 11
unchanged. No infantry attacks were b
made last night. Artillery lighting! z
continues. 11
France waits anxiously, hut con- j
, 1 fidcntly, the issue of today's battle.; ?
The Germans thus far. at the cost of *
large losses, have obtained command I1
of the approaches to the main French 1
positions beyond the west banks of the 1 '
.Mcuse. The real struggle will begin
when German masses hurl themselves G
on the four-mile line of heights extending
from Betliincourt to Cutuleres.
Yesterday's attack left the battle undecided.
Corbeaux wood in which the
Germans succeeded in establishing o
themselves is within a hollow between 1!
Uead Man and Coose hill and as ncith-! b
cr position is endangered, the German n
success Is of little strategic import- d
it nee.
It is known here that the Germans J*
set aside 300.000 men to capture Ver- "
dun. Only 200.000 having been era- w
ployed up to yesterday, it was a question
whether the remaining 100,000 *
would be used to make a sudden defan

line in developing the offensive against
the fortress. The heavy attacks west w
of the river, however, leave that question
no longer to be settled. The jraprosslon
of members of parliament,
who are kept regularly informed as tothe
progress of the battle, is that thej
defense will be able to resist all on-1.,
s laugh ts the Germans are able to i V
HI 11 make, and that Coose hill on the left
j bank will play a role similar to Dou'/
anmont, on the right.
It is expected the battle will reach
1 its climax tomorrow or Friday. Not
until then will it be possible to judge w
' which way the battle will go. y
The battle developed both In Inlen-!
i sitv and In extent all day yesterday m
and is now raging along the line from
Chcppey, In the Argonno, to Fresnes j,
In the Woevro showing that the second y,
attack for the stronghold Is to bc*made: si
on a larger^ scale than the first. So y<
far. according to the reports received; ol
here, the , German:; by employing, tc
masses of men without counting cost,
obtained some slight gains both to the w
west of the Mettse and in the Woevre, K
where they carried Fresnes after a
llcrcc struggle.
Desperate fighting Is again going on
I' on the west bank of the river. Following
up the advantage of yesterday, _
the Germans going around the foot of D
the slope, which serves them as a;
mask, followed the railroad' and entered
Regnievillc. From there they

OON BLOW
Is Weakening in Many Places
Now While Robinson's is
Growing Stronger.
CHARLESTON, March 8.?Tbo action
ot the Republican executive committees
of Kanawha' and McDowell
counties in endorsing Judge Ira E.
Robinson for governor, and Hon, William
P. Wile for United States senator
has 'token all the wind out of
candidate A. A. Lilly's sails, and Republicans
throughout the state predict
an early and complete tollapse
of his campaign, as a result of the Iobb
of these two counties. They base their
opinions upon Lilly's own claims,
which were made with reckless extravagance
up to, Saturday morning. The
uttorricy general from the ^beginning
ut UJB ; ypuijjiugu HUB. oouaieu limine
would carry practically every county
south of the* Kanawha river by overwhelming
majorities which would
more than off-set Roblpson'B advantage
in the .northern end of the state.
It is universally conceded that the
northern, counties will give the Judge
an almost unanimous vote, but there
were some people who believed be
would havo trouble in the southern
districts. The action of1 the MoDowcU
and Kanawha county committees, bowV
ever, has convinced them that tbanoted
jurist's popularity is hot in any
sense sectional.
Robinson., supporters have claimed
from the; outset mat Lllly's cahiplign
was .based principally on wind and
predict that it will soon, blow itself
out. They expect the goneral to claim
everything In sight for a few weeks
hoping thereby to hold- bis rapidly
weakening forces .together, but there
are many conservative Republicans
*7ho predict he will withdraw from;
the racelong .before Juoie 6.. 'ln sujik

"The judge la growing In strength

"Every day finds Robinson growing
