TiGER-JAYHAWKMEET
LOOKS Li TOSS-UP
Never in History of Annual
Clash Has Outcome Been
So Doubtful.
A WIN BY 3 POINTS?
That's One Way Missourian
Expert Figures It But It's
Only a Guess.
A favorable or unfavorable predic
tion of the outcome ot the Kansas
Missouri indoor meet March 17, may
depend largely upon the sa'isfactory
nature of jour breakfast. Never in
the kistorj of the meet have there
been so many events conceded to be
doubtful, and depending upon the
"breaks to determine the winner.
The high-jump, shot-put. quarter
mile and relay, are all toss-up events.
Coach Schul e sajs .Missouri root
ers are prone to oer-conlidence, in
view of the successful track season of
last j ear. He declares Missouri is
much more certain of her hurdlers
outdoor!) than in, and that the discus
throw and broad-jump, exclusive out
door events, were big factors in the
Tigers' high scores in last spring's
dual meets.
Sixteen men from each school may
compete, two cn'rants in each event.
Two places count 3 points for first,
3 for second, Fjirst place only it.
counted in the relay. There are eleven
events, totaling S3 points, 43 being
necessary to win.
Hiinlle Are Missouri!..
Kansas concedes the Tigers a clean
sweep in both the high and low hur
dles. Woodbury, Winn, Heath and
Elliott, the Kansas timber-froggers,
failed to place in competition against
the Missouri barrier-dodgers, Simp
son, Kenlck and Daggy, in the recent
K. C. A C. meet. Simpson and Nie
dorp captured both places in the 50
yard dash last jear. Ilcnick and
Pittam are each faster than Niedorp
In this event, so Missouri should have
little to fear in that event.
Captain Powell is expected to win
the pole-vault, Campbell of Kansas
taking an undisputed second. Pittam
and Trevvcke, high-jumpers, tied for
honors at the K. C. A. C. meet. A safe
estimate divides the points, 4 and 4.
Warren beat Captain Reber of Kan
sas in his favorite event, the shot
put, but is by no means certain of be
ing abb- to repeat the performance.
A second place is a none too conserva
tive estimate.
Where Kansas Shines.
Clean sweeps are conceded Kansas
in the half-mile, mile and 2-mile runs.
Grady and Sproul are the Kansas 2
milers. Grady running the -event in 10
minu'es flat in the K. C. A. C K. U.
meet Perhaps Fowler, Tiger mara
thoner, can wedge in between them
and perhaps not. Gabelman, Missouri
ailer, may push Edwards and Herriot
' for their places in this event. He has
run the distance in 4:39 on the
"bowl" at Ilothwell Gymnasium.
The quarter-mile, the half-mile and
the relay are interesting problems,
and much depends upon how Coach
William Oliver Hamilton uses his
trump card, Fred Itodkey. If Rodkey
enters the quarter, which comes be
fore the half, Rider, Missouri, will
Eive him the race of his life in the
half-mile. On the other hand, if
Rodkey passes up the quarter in or
der to cinch the half, can O'Leary
and Campbll, K. lT. quarter-milers,
hold down Niedorp, Daggy or Wyatt?
And if Itodkey should prove himself
equal to running both races, what is
soing to happen in the relay? Mo
mentous questions, these and questions
hich can only be answered by the
meet itself Certain it is, that it will
a meet in which the competition
IU not only bo exceedingly close, but
'a which the time, height or distance,
as the case may be, in each event will
be exceptionally good.
One Waj to Figure It.
Nothing is so futile as a "dope
rteef but so long as athletic con
tests exist, just so long will some ir
repressible, though misguided, "bug"
take it upon himself to tell jou all
about it beforehand.

MAV USE MACADAM
Berlin Reports Capture of
Several New Positions in
Fighting Near Verdun.
Ky United Tress
LONDON. March 8. The giant Ger
man nut cracker is closing tighter
upon the Verdun region this after
noon, according to reports from Berlin.
The Germans have announced of
ficially the capture of Regneville,
Forges, Fresnes and several positions
on the heights near Goose Hill.
Thousands of prisoners were taken in
the engagements.
Heavy artillery fighting is still in
progress along both banks of the
Meuso river. Dispatches from Paris
admit the loss of both Fiesnes and
Forges.
Present Improvements In
clude Bridges, Culverts and
New Gradings.
The shifting of the right of way to
eliminate a rough section of the Jef
ferson Citj -Columbia road was com
pleted Monday, when a deed to the
last strip of land necessary to carry
out the road plans was given to the
committee In charge by Mrs. Elizabeth
Sinclair of this city.
The securing of this particular
stretch eliminates two bridges, places
the highway back from the cliffs and
avoids a dangerous high bank east of
Northvvay's. This stretch has alwajs
been rough and dangerous.
Hugh Stephens of Jefferson City, a
member of the Columbia Road Com
mittee, sajs the road will be com
pleted this spring ajid that there is a
possibility of its being completely
macadamized within two jears. The
work of grading, bridge building and
securing the right of way has never
ceased since the beginning of the
movement, according to Mr. Stephens.
The grade of Poland Hill is being
cut this week from 17 per cent to 8
per cent. A bridge has been built at
Cedar City and another near there.
Many concrete culverts have been
constructed. Five miles have beon
graded and ditches dug along each
side.
Three of the four railroad crossings
on the highway have been removed by
the changes in the right of way, and
the soggy gumbo road along the Cedar
slough has been replaced by a new,
well-built island road. The Northway
Hill, with its 23 per cent grade, has
also been removed from the route.
"If the committee now had about
$300 more, it would be able to accom
plish wonders," said Mr. Stephens.
"We have been able to make our
money go about twice as far as we
otherwise could, owing to the valuable
aid of F. W. Buffum, state highway
commissioner, and his assistant, Judge
Bode. If the automobile owners and
other citizens of Columbia, Ashland
and Jefferson City would raise from
$500 to $1,000, we could make this
road so good that any machine could
easily make the distance from Colum
bia to Jefferson City in less than two
hours."

lloone County Woman Will lie Buried
at Torre Haute, Ind.
Mrs. W. C Buntin, C3 years old, died
at her home 509 Hitt street, at C
o'clock last night. Burial will be in
Terre Haute, Ind., her former home.
Her daughter, Miss Frances Buntin,
left with the body at 1:43 this af
ternoon. Friends accompanied Her to
Centralia and she will be joined at St.
Louis by Mrs. Davis Buntin. Mrs.
Emma Wagner, another daughter, a
senior in the University, will be un
able to attend the funeral services.
Martha Hickman was born in Boone
County, on a farm two miles from Co
lumbia. She attended school here
and was graduated from Stephens
College. Upon her marriage to Mr.
Buntin she moved to Terre Haute, re
turning to Columbia about four years
ago. During the four jears she had
been ill a great dsal of the time. Her
death was due to heart trouble.
Of Mrs. Buntin's three children,
two, Mrs. Emma Wagner and Miss
Frances Buntin, are residents of Co
lumbia. A son, Dr. Wilbur Buntin,
lives In New York City. Her sister,
Mrs. W. J. Booth, who had visited in
Columbia for a month went to Pasa
dena, Cal., a week ago.
Funeral services will probably be
held at the home or her brother-in-law,
George Buntin, in Terre Haute.
Juniors and Seniors at C. II. S. Plant
Banners From Roof.
Columbia High School students go
to school these mornings with an air
of expectancy. There Is no telling
how the high school building may be
decorated.
The juniors started it. One morn
ing the word "junior" was to be seen
at the apex of the roof of the building
and for that day the sign remained
to taunt the seniors and also to serve
as a stimulus for plans of revenge.
The net night the sign was obliterat
ed by a thick coating of black ink,
and a largo canvas, with the word
"senior" painted upon it, was there
instead to prove that the senior class
was not dead.
The senior banner disappeared the
following night, but whether the
March winds or some juniors were
the cause nobody seems to know.
A small junior pennant has appear
ed since, but it also has disappeared.
Perhaps the janitor has joined forces
with the March winds.

Day Before Girls' 18th Birthday.
On what day does one become of
age?
This question was suggested by a
story in the Missourian last week,
which told how a couple had to wait
twenty-four hours for a marriage
license, because they applied an the
day before the prospective bride's
eighteenth birthday anniversary.
Of course no one thinks of having
a birthday celebration on any day ex
cept the anniversary, but according to
Manley O. Hudson, professor of law
in the University, a person's age
changes legally the first Instant of the
day before the anniversary of his
birth.
"The reason," said Professor Hud
son, "is that it is not convenient to
count the fraction of a day as would
have to be done in case the change
were determined by the exact time the
person was born. On the day before
one's birthday, one has completed an
eveai number of years ot life, and it is
figured that the age changes on that
day."
