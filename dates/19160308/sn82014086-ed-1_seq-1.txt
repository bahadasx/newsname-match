Driving hard against the French line
north-west and southwest of Verdun,
the Germans have been enabled to
make additional gains toward Verdun,
but with extremely heavy casualties,
according to Paris. Hill 265 to the
southeast and a portion of Corzeaux
Wood, directly south of Forges, have
been occupied by the Germans through
strong infantry attacks which were
preceded by extremely heavy bom
bardments.. The towns of Fresnes in
the Woevre also has been captured.
The German attack was over the en
tire front west of the Meuse extending
from Bethin court to the river, but
except in the Corbeaux Wood and at
Hill 265 the French held back the at
tackers at all points. Thus the French
still occupy the important strategic
positions on the heights of the Cote
de 1'Oie, for the possession of which
numerous ranguinary engagements
have been fought.
The occupation of a portion of the
Corbeaux Wood would indicate that

NO ACTION FOR RELIEF
OF FREIGHT CONGESTION
Interstate Commerce Commission
Hearing is Without Result Thus Far.
Washington, March 7. Ater two
days discussion of freight cognestion
at the eastern terminals of trunk line
railroads and car shortage in the west,
the informal conference called by the
Interstate Commerce Commission of
representatives of the carriers, ship
pers and receivers of freight, adjourn
ed tonight without agreeing on action
to relieve the situation.
As a consequence of the discussion
it is probable that many of the af-
feced roads will lay definite proposals
before the commission for increasing
the demurrage and storage charges at
terminals and reducing the time al
lowed receivers of freight to unload
cars without extra charge. From
opinions expressed by many shippers
and receivers it is probable that such
changes will be vigorously opposed.
Virtually all of the speakers in the
two days' session declared that the
situation must be handled promptly
promptly and any action that may be
taken is expected in the near future.
NEW HAVEN ROAD'S
EFFORTS TO HANDLE. FREIGHT
200 More Engines Put in Operation
and More Contracted For.
Washington, March 7. At the dis
cussion of freight congestion before
the Interstate Commerce Commission
today Howard Elliott said that the
New Haven in December handled 27
per cent, more freight than normal,
although its efflciencq had been reduc
ed more than half by storms; had put
in operation more than 200 engines
laid up before the present strain be
gan and had borrowed others and con
tracted for more.
"We're all doing our utmost to cure
the difficulty," said Mr. Elliott. "What
I want to urge here Is that freight be
promptly unloaded: and removed and
removed and I believe that such meas
ures wi have a strong curative effect."
Mr. Elliott referred to a suggestion
made by a representaive of the ship-
pers earlier in the day that the trunk
line carriers should combine at New
York to handle the lighter fleet or that
this business should be turned over
by the carriers to one concern. He said
that the tendency In this country had
been to discourage and frown upon
such combinations.

In his reply Mr. McAdoo said:
"Do you realize that your telegram
of 5th Inst, places you In very awkward
position? You practically ask me to
bribe you to govern your conduct as a
delegate to national convention by giv
ing your brother position of deputy
surveyor of Boston, which has been
abolished because it is unnecessary, or
to increase his salary to six dollars per
day. Your offense is a serious one and
deserves to be treated with the con
tempt I accord it. I shall not prosti
tute the public service as you propose,
and you can act as you please at the
national convention."

E. Wimber, until Feb. 15 mailing clerk
on the battleship Vermont at Norfolk,
Va., was arretted here today as he was
applying at the postoffice for mall un

able for $100 each. Two of these, it is
charged, he cashed in Atlanta, Ga. His

PROHIBITION DEFEATED BY MA
JORITY OF 13,164 VOTES.
RESULT WAS A SURPRISE
State
Voted for Direct Primary by a
Majority of 3,700 System Will Be
come Effective at Spring Conventions
Rutland, Vt, March 7. Local op
tion won over prohibition in this state
today by a margin of 13,164 votes. The
prohibitory amendment was first plac
ed on the statute books in 1872 and
was repealed in 1903 by a majority of
(29. The vote today on the question
of re-enacting the amendment was
yea, 18,503: no, 31,667.
Orleans Only County to Vote Yes.
Every county in the state with the
exception .of. Orleans gave a majority
In favor of local option.
The vote was taken In connection
with the annual town meetings held
throughout the state, the proposed
amendment having been passed by the
last legislature and submitted to the
people in a referendum.
The Result Was a Surprise.
Because of the narrow margin of
thirteen years ago, the advocates ot
prohibition were hypeful that the state
would turn against liquor selling. The
result was a surprise, not only to the
prohibitory campaign committee and
the Anti-Saloon league, but also to tha
local option leaders who said they had
not looked for so decisive a victory.
Owing to the heavy snow in the
mountains the total vote was consldor
ably smaller than that thrown at the
state election a year ago last No
vember.
Vote For Direct Primary.
The state voted for direct primary
elections by a majority of 3,700. The
system will go into effect for the selec
tion of delegates to the national con
ventions this spring.
Among the features of the vote on
tho liquor question was the fact that
many towns which voted against pro
Mbitlon refused to grant licenses for
the sale of liquor during the coming
year.
P.ev. Clifford Smith of Burlington,
superintendent of the Anti-Saloon
lcacrue said:
"The result is a great surprise, but
It Is not significant nor will It have
any bearing on the movement for na
tional prohibition. We realize that
the small towns aid not wake up as
was expected.

in tne senate last week.
Party Lines Disregarded.
From the very outset of the fight
today the president's supporters, with
out regard to party, swept over the
opposition.
Test Vote 256 to 160.
On the first vote, which was a
parliamentary proposition to prevent
opening the McLemore resolution to
amendment and unlimited debate, the
administration forces carried the day.
256 to 16o. On that 192 democrats,
63 republicans and 1 progressive voted
to support the administration. Twenty-one
democrats, 132 republicans,
five progressives, one independent and
Representative London, the lone so

This was the crucial vote of the tight,
the one point on which administration
leaders were uncertain. With victory
in hand they moved on to the next
proposition, the adoption of a special
rule for four hours discussion of the
McLemore resolution.
Again they carried the day 271 to
13S and then pushed their victory to a
conclusion by tabling the McLeomrc
resolution. L76 to 142.

the declaration of war with Sraln.
Wilson Calm and Confident
President Wilson, calm nnd confl

voting in the cabinet rooms at the
V hlte House with some of the cab
inet group about him. He told them
he was much gratified with the sup
port of congress.
Released from the bonds of emhar
rassment forced upon him by the tlis
senions in congress, which have been
represented in foreign capitals as in

representatives of the people, Presi
dent Wilson now stands prepared to go
on with the submarine negotiations
with the central powers.

The next step probably will be an
answer to Germany's last proposal to
settle the Lusitania rase, in which the
United States probably will ask for
such further assurances as it consid

guarantee that the new submarine
campaign which began on March 1 and
in which notice has been given that
all ships carrying guns will be sunk
without warning, will not endanger

Bryan Showed No Influence.
One of the day's surprises was the
failure of the so-called Bryan influ

strength against the president.
McLemore Alone Spoke for Resolution
In all the fieht nobody, except Rep
resentative McLemore himself, had a
good word to say for the resolution
about which all the storm centered.
The republicans who fought tabling
it did so only because they wanted a
chance to substitute aonther drawn
by Representative Campbell of Kan

the MoLemore resolution was as broad
and as good as the Campb. U resolu

Good Feeling Prevailed.
The long debate, lasting from 11
o'clock in the morning until well nf

interruption, was conducted with the
utmost good feeling.
The galleries were packed through

Winston Churchill
Attacks Admiralty
IN DARING SPEECH ANSWERING
LORD BALFOUR.
LACKS DRIVING FORCE
Declares It Must be Revitalized Be
fore It is Too Late by Bringing Back
Lord Fisher to Head the Admiralty.
London. March 7. Winston Spencer
Churcmli, former first lord of tne ad
miralty, now a colonel and fresh from
the trenchex, sprang back into the par
liamentary arena today in a daring
speech answer.ng Kird Lord of the Ad
miralty Balfour, who had Just pre
sented the naval estimates, and de
claring that the adm. rally lacked driv
ing force and must be revitalized be
fore it was too late by bringinb back
Lord Fisher, the former first sea lord,
to head the admiralty administration.
Interest in Churchill's Reappearance.
Great interest attached to Colonel
Churchill's reappearance after a period
of silence while serving with the army
ar.d niiile the naval pulicy he had in
augurated at the opening of the war
was undergoing considerable change.
Balfour's Optimistic Statement.
Mr. Balfour had lust concluded an
optimistic statement of the naval out-
iook. wnich strong.y appealed to tho
patriotic sentiments of the bouse of
commons: so that Colonel Churchill's
suggestions were at hrts received cold
ly. But he gradually gained attention
and applause until he closed amid a
scene of enthusiasm.
"A Jarring Note of Warning."
He referred to his remarka aa "a
Jarring note and warning" which be
said had to be given. Since he re
turned from the front he had received
Information which was not entirely
sa.sfying concerning the progress of
naval construction. Details must
necessarily be avoided, he said, but it
could be said that if every capital ahlp
provided for in the naval programme
had been completed the navy would be
ready, with an ample margin of safety.
It was within the power of the admir
alty to complete this programme, but
he expressed doubt whether thie had
been done. Meanwhile there was an
Impenetrable veil over the German
programme.
Navy Should Be in Readiness.
"That is a grave fact," said Colonel
Churchill, "for, while we know nothlnar
yet, we may be cure that something la
gong on there. That the German nary,
built up by the kaiser's greatest ef
forts, is remaining idle in Kiel canal
without some further supreme effort
for its development, is unthinkable. W
should therefore assume that Germany
has completed her naval programme.
And, if ours has not been completed,
then some weighty reasons should be
given.
"These new ships are what the
country relies r.r, mu-t and over-
e any further development Ger
many may havu n.ijo. '
