RESULT OF STRIKE RIOT PROBE
Indict East Younerstown Mayor
and Coancilnien.
Unable to Locate Blame for
Reign of Anarchy.
Toungstown, Ohio. March S. In
dict ment were returned today against
the Youngstown Sheet and Tube com
pany, the Republic Iron and Steel
company, the Brier Hill Steel em-pui-y.
the Youngstown Iron and Steel
company, the Carnegie Steel com
pany, the U. S. Steel company, and
Judge K. H. Gory, executive chairman
of the L S. Steel company, charging
them with having formed a trust to
fix the wages of common labor in vio
lation of the laws of Ohio.
These indictments followed an in
vestigation of the Fast Youngstown
riots and labor troubles of January.
The specific offense charged against
the six steel concerns is that they con
spired to keep the wages, in January,
of common labor at the same figure
as the Republic Iron and Steel com
pany and the Youngstown Sheet and
Tube company. Announcement was
made by all these companies within
two days time of a ten per cent in
Cfaas in wages. This action is held
to be due to an agreement.
Town Officials for Graft
Indictments also were returned
against Mayor V. H. Cunningham and
six councilmen of Bast Youngstown,
charging them with being financially
interested in property purchased for
vlllase ptorpoeask
Anionc otfcfe things'. he jury repcV"
sets forth that the grand jury was un
able to fix any particular cause for
the reoem lvist Youngstown reign of
anarchy. The report criticises Mayor
W. H. Cunningham and members of
the East Youngstown police force, say
ing that neither the mayor nor any
member of the police lorce made any
effort whatever to disperse the mob.
Mayor Cunningham is criticised for
not closing the saloons early on Fri
day morning after he had received no
tice of the temper of the mob. The
report says the mayor and police of
ficials of Bast Youngstown were guilty
of such Lnef ficiency and such disre
gard for the law as to be unfix and un
worthy to fill the positions which they
hold.
Guardsman Violated Rights.
The report recites the fact that a
guard at the Youngstown Sheet A-
Tube company, who is a member of
the state militia, took without
legal authority tn members of
the National Guard to the Tube com
pany's property to guard the same.
It Is also stated that the guard ap
propriated state ammunition although
the grand jurors say they do not fee!
that he intended to steal the ammuni
tion. It is set forth that the action
of the guard made it impossible for
the sheriff or captain or the militia to
mobilize militiamen in time of grave
public danger.
Guards on the Sheet & Tube com
pany bridge, who fired ;nto the crowd
assembled about the time keepers of
fice before the rioting began, are cen
sured The. x-eport says the guards
were not of the standard to be trusted
with such a responsible duty.
The report says the grand jury was
unable to find that the influence of
any foreign government was respon
sible for the riot. The alleged com
bination of manufacturers with the
intent to keep down the wages of
common labor is criticised.
Gary F.n raged at Indictment.
New York, March S. - When ,n
formed of the indictment returned at
Youngstown against himself. Judge
KIbert H. Gary issued the following
state meat:
"There are no facts to justify the
indictment returned by the Mahoning
county jury against the companies or
any of the officers. The indictment
is an outrage travesty."

! ENGLAND FORCED U-BOAT LAW
Are l.u-itaiia and Armed Ship
Rule Connected?
Disagree on This and Continue
to Split Hairs.
Washington. March 8- Germany
today delivered to the state depart
ment what may be her "last word" in
the armed merchantman controversy.
Through a memorandum delivered
to Ambassador Von Bernstorff, the
imperial government declares the or
der to submarine commanders to sink
armed merchantmen without warning
was necessitated by numerous viola
tions of international law by ihe allies.
It claims these instructions were
acknowledged by the United States.
The fact that the memorandum was
delivered today was regarded as sig
nificant as It follows immediately the
vote of congress to leave all interna
tional negotiations in the hands of the
president and state department.
In addition to setting forth the rea
sons for the decree that armed ships
are to be sunk without warning, the
memorandum renews the suggestion
that concessions by the allies regard
ing the arming of merchantmen might
modify the German order.
Kngland's Violations.
This suggestion is taken to indicate
that Germany hopes the United States
may resume her efforts toward bring
ing the allies to agree to disarm all
merchant ships and permit further
discussion of the question.
"Germany faces these facts," the I
document reads in reviewing the acts j
which forced Germany to inaugurate I
the new drastic submarine raid cam- i
paign:
"(A) A blockade contrary to inter-
national law has for one year been !
keeping neutral trade from German '
ports and is making German exports!
impossible.
Extend Contra-band Provisions.
"(B) For eighteen months through t
t-he extending of contraband provisions'
fti violation of international law the
overseas trade ot neighboring neutral
countries, so far as Germany is con
cerned, nas been hampered.
C) The interception ' of mails in
violation of international law is meant
to stop any intercourse of Germany
with foreign countries.
"(D) Hngland. by systematically
and increasingly oppressing neutral
countries, following the principle of
'Might before right, has prevented
neutral trade on land with Germany
so as to complete the blockade of the
central powers intended to starve their
civil population.
Grab German Citizens.
"(B) Germans met by our enemies
on the high seas are deprived of their
liberty no matter whether they are
combatants or non-combatants.
F) Our enemies have armed
their merchant vessels for off en si
purpose theoretically, making it im
possible to use our U-boats, according
to the principles set forth in the Lon
don declaration.

i
London, March 8. Col. Winston
Churchill, former first lord of the ad
miralty, came back from the trenches
to warn the house of commons that it
must beware of the German fleet.
This warning comes right on the heels
of the report that the German fleet
has sailed out into the North sea.
"that Germany will be content to al
low her fleet to lie impotent and de
rided in the Kiel canal. We must as
sume that something has happened in
German naval yards and that Ger
many has completed all her pro
gram." In a sensational speech Tuesday Mr.
Churchill proceeded to criticise tht
admiralty for its "pure strategic pas
sivity" since he had resigned its con
trol. He urged hi? successor, Arthur
Balfour, to recall Lord Fisher to the
admiralty for the purpose of injecting
new life into it.
Lord Fisher, it will be remembered,
was first sea lord of the admiralty
when Mr. Churchill was the first lord
and it was difference of opinion be
tween the two men that led to Mr.
Churchill's retirement.

to Secretary of State Lansing. The in
structions or advice, it & said, were
under three general heads which were
about as follows:
What He Was to Do.
First, Colonel House was to
make no proposition of any kind
at any European capital on the
subject of peace. He was. how
ever, to draw out as adroitly as
he could from German, French
and English authorities wh. t were
the views of the chancellories as
to the necessity for peace.
Second, Colonel House was in
structed to obtain definitely from
the Knglish cabinet or It repre
sentative. Great Britain's last
word as to a modification of her
blockade. The object of this was
to determine what hope there was
for the reopening of the subject
of gettir.g foodstuffs into Ger
j many which this government has
considered to be an international
right.
Third, to ascertain the last
word from Germany as to her
modification of her reprisals by
submarine warfare against the
British blockade.
It was pointed out that the develop
j ments in Europe which caused the
f split between the president and con
! gress followed almost immediately the
