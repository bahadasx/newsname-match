School of Home Economics.
As stated last week the school in
home economics will begin Tuesday
afternoon, March 14, and close Friday
night, March 17. These sessions will
be held in the domestic science room
of the academy building. There will
be two sessions daily of two hours
each, the afternoon sessions beginning
at 2.30 and the evening sessions at 7.30.
This is a school for teaching practical
ways of rooking simple foods and
economical buying. The instruction is
given in the form of lectures, illus
trated by demonstrations. ini3 is a
community affair and every woman is
urged to be present at every session.
This school means to the housekeeper
what agricultural extension service
means to the farmer. The meetings
are free to any woman wishing to at
tend and it is hoped as many as possible
will avail themselves of the opportu
nity. . . -
t
Fine Concert Closes Lecture Course,
Musicians in general are enthusiastic
over the entertainment given by the
Chicago Musical Club in Seaver's hal
Friday evening, as the closing number
in the lecture course. The house was
crowded. The course closed with a
slight balance on the right side.
The personnel or the company was
somewhat changed from the advertis
ing furnished by the lyceum bureau
but every member was an artist and
the program gave general satisfaction.
In ensemble work the company was at
its best perhaps, but the solo numbers
by the flutist, the cornetist, the first
violinist and 'celloist were heartily
encored. The Chicago Musical club
would undoubtedly bring out a ful
bouse should tney ever appear m
Barton again.

by letters from other churches,
Village Finances Good Annual Meeting.
The annual village meeting is
warned for Tuesday evening next at
7.30 o'clock. The warning contains
little out of the ordinary unless it may
be articles 11, 12 and 13 which bring
the question of a fireproof sub-station
to the voters. The slight fire ex
perienced at our wooden sub-station is
only an example of what might happen.
Had conditions been slightly different
at the time of the fire, current consu
mers might have been without electri
city for a week or more instead of for
only a day or so. Now that so many
persons are being served through this
station and the loss to the village so"
great and to the individuals even
greater when there is cessation of
current, it behooves the village to take
every precaution to have its plant in
the very safest condition.
Another article, number 16, not con
tained in the warning as printed in the
report but a part of the official warn
ing reads :
16 To see if the village will vote to
pay 15 per cent of its highway tax for
1916 to the town treasurer of Barton to
be expended upon the highways of the
town outside of said village.
The annual village reports, which
are now in the hands of the voters,
show good records in every department.
The summary by the auditors shows a
net gain in water, electric light and
visage department as follows :water de
partment, $968 47; electric department,
4999 44; village, $23.46. The water
department is entirely free from debt
and besides owning the plant has re
sources of more than $1100. The electric
department owes nothing but its bonds
of $40,000 and has resources of $5800
making the net liability here about
$34,000.
Mrs. Charles E. Pierce.
The many friends of Mrs. C. E.
Pierce were saddened to learn of her
death which occurred on the Westmore
road Friday evening. Although she
had been a sufferer from diabates for
the past two years the end came sud
denly. Irene A. Randall was born in
Lyndon, May 2. 1889, the eldest
daughter of Edward and Margaret
Randall. She attended Lyndon insti
tute and began teaching school when
seventeen years of age and hs been a
very successful teacher, having taught
in Glover, Barton and Westmore. She
was married to Charles E. Pierce Nov.
9, 1910, who survives her, with a
father, three sisters, Misses Julia and
Charlotte, and Mrs. Sara Rock and
two brothers, Edward and Stephen.
The funeral was held at the house,
Monday at 1 o'clock, Rev. W. A.
Warner officiating. The presence of
so many friends at the service and the
beautiful floral tributes showed the
esteem in which the deceased was
held. A wide circle of friends extend
sincerest sympathy.
Card of Thanks We wish to express
our sincere and heartfelt thanks for
the sympathy and help extended to us
in our recent bereavement. We would
also extend thanks for the beautiful
flowers.
Charles E. Pierce,
Mr. Randall and family.

Perry Prohibition Measure Fails
Vote Overwhelmingly In Favor of Local Option.
Primary Bill Becomes Law.
About Usual Number of License Towns
Orleans Counny Only One Giving
Perry Measure a Majority. County
Vote in Detail. Barton Gives Perry
Bill Largest Majority of Any Town
or City in State.
Yesterday's results in the state were
an admitted surprise to both supporter
of the Perry measure and the local
option cause. While the total vote
was approximately that of the vote in
1903 when local option became a law in
Vermont with a margin in its favor of
less than 1000, yesterday's vote gave a
local option margin of more than 13,000
votes. In fact every county in the
state gave the Perry measure the cold
shoulder except Orleans while the
majority in this county was reduced
from more than 2000 to 369.
The state adopted the direct primary
measure by nearly 3500 majority. The
system will go into effect for the
selection of delegates to the national
conventions this spring, and state and
county officers and town represent a
tives will be nominated by this system
hereafter.
License towns in the state number
23 as against 20 last year. Three of
these, Norton, Brunswick and Canaan
are in Essex county, but Brighton
(Island Pond) voted against license.
St. Albans, Burlington, Barre, Rut
land and Bennington are the larger
places voting license. In several in
stances the majority for license is
larger than usual. Rutland and Bur
lington show a marked increase.
Montpelier is dry.

ORLEANS COUNTY VOTE
Orleans county's total vote yesterday
on the Perry and primary referendum
bills was light compared with its vote
on the referendum in 1903 when local
option was adopted. The total vote
then is shown in a table accompanying
this article and it will be seen that
while the county then cast 3526 votes
on the question, yesterday the total
vote was only 2599, a falling off of
almost 1000. In other words there
were so many stay-at-homes yesterday.
The local license question vote was, a
little larger than ordinary but the
majority against the granting of
licenses was about as usual. Jay is
the only town voting to grant licenses.
Albany, Lowell and Jay are the only
towns giving a majority against the
Perry bill while Barton gave the
largest majority for it. 8i). Newport
c-st the largest vote The measure
was given a majority in the county of
369, the only county in the state giv
ing the bill a majority. Derby, which
has been the only town in the county
for several years to grant a druggist
license, voted asrainst it this year ar.d
irifcie will be no druggist license in tht
cnuniy in 1916 Jay has before voted
license but no one ever took it out and
it is oubtful if Jay has a sil.ion.
The primary measure was given a
county majority of 611 while Jay end
Morgan were the only towns giving a
majority against it, with Westmore
tied.

Barton Has Lively Town Meeting.
One of the , besjt-attended, longest
and liveliest town meetings Barton has
had in years was yesterday's session.
The moderator called the meeting to
order soon after the Orleans men were
able to get to the hall from their train,
about 10.30 o'clock, and save for a
noon recess was in solid session until
3.30 o'clock.
After the re-election of W. W. Reir
den as moderator and F. D. Pierce as
clerk, the fun began over the accept

the $1000 appropriation and 87 against
it.
After some discussion it was voted
to install the uniform system of town
accounting, but the article as to the
purchase of a stone crusher was
passed over. It was voted to have the
selectmen provide a suitable place in
which to store the tools and machinery
belonging to the town. The town
library was voted $300 and each grand
army post $25 as usual.
The tax raised was as follows :
Total road .45, general fund ,90, town
school .75, winter roads; .03 and the
taxes required by law of state school.

work necessary for the listers this year

their work at the time required by law,
without clerical assistance. It was
voted to allow the listers to employ
such clerical assistance as necessary
to complete their work as required by
law. The result of the referendum
votes and the "yes" and "no" vote
will be found in the tables containing

Prospect Pomona Grange.
Another interesting meeting of
Prospect Pomona Grange was held
with Crystal Lake Grange at Barton
Thursday, March 2. The meeting was
opened and presided over by the
Pomona Master. W. G. Dutton, of
Brownington. The roll of officers was
called and the report of the last meet
ing read by the secretary. A report
from each subordinate Grange was
called for and responded to by the
masters of the several Granges who
were all present except the master of
Navy Grange of Charleston. An ex
ecutive committee composed of F. W.
Hastings of Glover, B. J. Jenness of
Barton and George Phillips of Iras
burg, was appointed by the master.
At the noon hour a typical Grange
dinner was served by the ladies of
Crystal Lake Grange and ample justice
was done to the bountiful repast by all
present. After the noon recess seven
candidates were given the obligation
and welcomed as Pomona members.
The committee who had previously
been elected to make arrangements for
a Grange fair to be held the coming
fall reported that the Orleans fair
company would donate the use of their
grounds and buildings for that purpose
and full arrangements will be made at
a later date. The Grange was fortu
nate to have as a visiting member,
State Lecturer E. H. Hallett of St.
Johnsbury Center. Mr. Hallett ex
pressed his pleasure of meeting with
the Grange and gave good suggestions
for its advancement along several
lines. The lecturer, Mrs. B. J. Jen
ness, presented the following pleasing
program: Piano duet, Mrs. Hastings
and Mrs. Towne ; reading, Mrs. Merton
Willson ; recitation, Miss Ruth Newton ;
recitation, Master Leslie Reagan;
song, Miss Ruth Gleason. The ques
tion. "Is the farmer who is always
complaining of his work and hard
times a detriment to his profession?"
was discussed from all points and it was
proven that a grumbler has no place on
earth and a kicker many times accom
plishes much good. Last but by no
. .1 mm
means least wa3 the musical program
given by an orchestra of seven pieces
which was heartily applauded and much
enjoyed by all. The next meeting will
be held with Navy Grange at West
Charleston, the date being left to be
named by Navy Grange. The mind of
all seemed to be in accord with the
idea expressed by Mr. Hallett, that if
more such meetings were held we
would have fewer grumblers to meet
in life's road.
The Frank Walsh Musical Comedy.
Frank Walsh has just closed one
week's engagement in St. Johnsbury

MR.
HAMBLET'S VISIT TO
GRAMMAR SCHOOL
THE
This morning after we came down
from the general science room we
found Mr. Hamblet waiting in our
room. He told us that to tax a person
the value of his property must be
found. Some articles such as watches
which are not worth more than $25
are not taxed. - First a man is taxed on
real estate. Ihe personal estate con
sists of cattle, furniture and other
articles. A power boat which is not in
the village cannot be taxed in the
village. Bonds themselves cannot be
taxed, but the interest on these bonds
can be taxed. A man having shares of
bank stocks is taxed. A man that ha3
cash on hand can be taxed on it. Mr.
Hamblet gave each of us a tax inven
tory such as is filled out for or by the
listers. We added imaginary personal
and real estate. We took 1 per cent of
the total amount and the result was
the money upon which a tax would be
paid. The poll tax is $2 and every man
from 21 to 70 must pay such tax.

The text for the morning talk was
found in I Sam. 21-8, the subject being,
"The King's Business." A man should
be ready to give his life if need be for
the cause he serves. He should be
prompt in the dispatch of duty when
he has made up his mind what ought
to be done, for to hestitate and dally
then is to openly invite failure. Many
people regard themselves as belonging
to themselves so to speak, responsible
to no one and able to do whatever they
wish, so long as they keep within the
law. Such a life writes Self in capital
letters. God has given to everyone a
special task; everyone has a mission
to fulfill, xou need not remain long
in doubt as to what God would have
you do if you earnestly desire to know.
God is still working in this world as
is evident to everyone, and he works
through other people. In every great
world-crisis God has stood ready with a
man. We may have to toil at an
obscure task ; we may have to give the
cup of cold water because we have
nothing else to give, but if we do such
work faithfully, we are truly great
and noble in God's sight. It is always
the way in which we do our work, that
determines our standing in God's sight.
Our first business is to seek the King
dom of God. We must start right or
the end of the journey will bring
defeat. Then we should be prompt in
"The King's Business," as there is
much to do and the laborers are so few.
Life is short and if we do not improve
every opportunity, we may have to
leave our mission unfulfilled., our work 1
unfinished.
The evening servica was a union one
held at the Methodist church, and was
addressed by Rev. Mr. Douglass, who
exchanged with Mr. Warner. The
subject was "Antipas, the Type of
Faithful Martyr." From the man, we
can judge what sort of a church pro
duced him. That is a question for the
pulpit now : What kind of folks have
we reason to think will be produced by
our preaching? When the church pro
duces a certain type of man, he in turn
gives inspiration and strength to the
organization. The most effective kind
of preaching is doubtless the testimony
of the one who has seen and felt cer
tain things. We ought to have a
revival of religious conversation. In
the early years of the church, men felt
that they had something worth dying
for, and in producing the martrys
the church has grown and prospered.
We are nqt as yet called upon to be
martyrs but there are calls upon us
and we are in more danger of failing
in these than if we were called upon to
be a martyr, for a crisis brings out our
strength and ease weakens us.
There will not be any services in the
church until Sunday, March 19, as the
pastor is taking the remainder of his
vacation. '
Remember the entertainment on
Friday evening. Everyone cordially
invited to come. '
