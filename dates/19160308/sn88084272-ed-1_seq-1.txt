for a decisive struggle, a French of

"We replied at once to the German
attack with a curtain of fire to prevent
the enemv from opening a path Into our
lines. But the Germans, despite enor
mous losses commenced to overflow on
all sides Out batteries kept shortening
their range as the Germans advanced,

retained their presence of mind, pulled
off their coats and redoubled ,their ef
forts to Intensify their fire,' urging
their comrades to put forth their great
est efforts.
Lack of ammunition somewhat ham
pered the operations, the officer says
and the gunners worked against great
odds in the rain of shells from German
batteries. Several French pieces were
destroyed in the bombardment and oth
ers were rendered useless. "Use up what
ammunition vou have and then blow up
the guns," was the order from the
