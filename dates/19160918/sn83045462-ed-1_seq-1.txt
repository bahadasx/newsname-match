MAI. GEN. MILLS
DIES OF PNEUMONIA
Stricken Last Night After Din
ner, Failing to Respond to
Treatment.
' MILITIA DIVISION CHIEF
HAD BRILLIANT CAREER
Was Awarded Congressional Medal
for Heroic Service in the Spanish
American War.
SAJ. GEN. ALBERT L. MILLS.
Maj. Gen. Albert L. Mills, chief
of the militia bureau of the War
Department, died suddenly about
12:30 o'clock today, at the family
home, 1523 K street, from an at
tack of acute pneumonia. Up to
last night he had been in appar
ently excellent health.
Yesterday afternoon he took a long
automobile ride in the country, and ate
a hearty meal upon his return to the
house. About 9 o'clock he complained
? of feeling ill, saying that he felt chilly
and was afraid he had caught cold on
the ride. He was persuaded to go to
bad and physians were called in. In
spite, however, of all medical attention
he rapidly became worse, and died
about noon.
His death came as a great shock to all
of the officials of the War Department,
in view of the fact that he was in un
usually fine spirits Saturday at the de
partment.
No arrangements have been made for
the funeral, but it is taken for granted
that Gen. Mills will be buried in the
Arlington national cemetery with mili
tary honors.
Friend of National Oaard.
During his four years as head of the
militia bureau of the "War Department
Gen. Mills worked out the mobilization
plans for the state troops which have
been used so successfully during the
Mexican border situation. He con
tended vigorously for increasing the
efficiency of the National Guard, and \
dealt ur.paringly with the faults of the
system or of individual organizations
whenever he appeared before Congress
In connection with army legislation.
The task of federalizing the state troops
under the plan laid out by Congress in
the reorganization bill recently signed has
rested largely upon Gen. Mills as chief of
that bureau. His work was greatly com
plicated by the fact that the troops were I
railed for border duty before there had !
been opportunity to work out the new
scheme.
<Jen. Mills leaves, besides his wife, a
son. Lieut. Chester P. Mills of the 9th
Cavalry, and a daughter. Mrs. Emil P.
l^aursr.n. the wife or Lieut. Laurson of
the 11th Cavalry.

ing attached to the 1st Cavalry. Dur
ing tne Spanish-American war he was
distinguished for bravery and coolness
after being shot through the head and
| entirely without sight near Santiago,
Cuba, In that condition encouraging the
troops near him. For this service he
nvas awarded the congressional medal
of honor.
Whn the Spanish-American war began
Gen. Mills was made assistant adjutant
jfene?i 1 of volunteers. After the war

sion of militia affairs.
POLICE OUT TO HANDLE
BANK RUN IN CHICAGO
CHICAGO. September 18.?Police were
railed today to handle a crowd of de
positors which continued the run started
yesterday on the state bank of Schiff
& Co., despite the assurance of its offi
cials thai the institution is solvent. The
run began because of alarm spread by
the collapse of three private banks last
week. Officials of the Schiff bank said

Also Reported Fighting Along
side the Russians and Ru
manians in Dobrudja.
FURTHER GAINS ARE MADE
BY GEN. VON MACKENSEN
Defending Forces in Rumania Re
ported Falling Back to New and
Strong Positions.
BERLIN, September 18,
via London, 5:55 p.m.?The
allied (entente) forces in
Eastern Rumania have re
ceived reinforcements, the
war office announced today.
They have taken up a line
across Dobrudja, a few miles
south of the railroad run
ning from Constanza to the
Danube.
LONDON, September 18.?A
further advance for the Serbians
on the western end of the Mace
donian front is reported in a dis
patch sent out today under a
Saloniki date by the Exchange
Telegraph Company. _ .
It says the first and second line
trenches of the Bulgarians at
Kaimakcalan have been taken by
the Serbians, who have crossed
Broda river. Heavy fighting con
tinues on the farther bank of the
river.'
Guns and Prisoners Taken.
The Serbians are reported to have
taken four field guns and eight ma
chine guns, bringing: up to thirty-six
the number of gruns captured. A large
number of prisoners, the exact number
of which is unknown, also is said to
I have fallen into the hands of the Ser
1 bians.
j The dispatch also reports that French
troops on the allied left wing: have
! captured the station at Fiorina. Heavy
fighting continues.
The forces under Field Marshal von
Mackensen are continuing to progress
in their campaign in the Rumanian
province of Dobrudja. Sofia reports.
Some indication of stronger resistance
by the Rumanians and Russians, how
ever, is furnished by the official state
ment. which reports heavy counter at
tacks.
Retiring' to New Positions.
A dispatch to the Times from Ru
manian headquarters, dated Sunday,
says that In Dobrudja the Russo-Ru
manlan forces are falling back and fak
ing up a strong position on a line ex
tending from Rasovo to Tuzla.
The presence of a division of Ser
bian troops in Rumania, alluded to in
recent press dispatches, has not been
officially accounted for. The probabil
ities are that some Serbian troops were
forced into Rumanian territory during
the Teutonic drive through Serbia last
fall, being interned there and liberated
for service with the entente forces
when Rumania entered the war, or else
that the division is composed of Serbian
residents of Rumania.
5,000 Loss in Three Hours.
"The Bulgarians lost 5,000 men in
three hours of fighting in the first clash
between the Serbians and Bulgars in
eastern Dobrudja," says Reuter's Odessa
correspondent.
The fighting was very bitter. It was
mostly hand to hand, and no prisoners
were taken by either side. The Bul
; gars, aided by Germans, made eighteen
attacks, all of which were repulsed
I with great losses. German cavalry also
came into the action, trying to take the
Serbs by an attack in the rear. The
Serbian rear line received them with
the bayonet and most of the cavalry
was exterminated.
Invasion of Rumania.
AMSTERDAM, via I^ondon. September
18.?Details of Field Marshal von Mack
ensen's victory over the Russians and
Rumanians in the Dobrudja district are
given in a copy of the Berlin Vossische
Zeitung received here. The paper
says:
"A German division moving along the
Danube east of Silistria drove back a
Rumanian division upon the Russians,
who formed the right and center of the
(line The Germans then got on the
i flank of the Russians, and at the same
i time German and BtJlgarian cavalry,
j operating on the German right, drove
a Serbian division back along the rail
| road. Thus Field Marshal Mackensen's
j troops formed the letter U, with the
Russians, Serbians and Rumanians
' crowded within the loop.
"The Russians held their front for
some time until Mackensen concen
trated his forces on them and their re
sistance collapsed."
The Rester Lloyd says:
"The battle of Bodrich. which cleared
Mackensen's right flank, lasted three
days and nikhts. The Rumanian forces
came up only on the third day. The
brunt of the lighting was maintained
by the Russians and the Serbians."

donment by the Germans of
the villages of Berny and
Deniecourt, together with
positions between Barleux
and Vermandovillers, south
of the River Somme, is re
ported in today's official
statement. North of the

ably to the Germans.
LONDON, September 18, 3
pm.?The new thrust by the
French south of the River Somme
in northern France, where the im
portant railway town of Chaulnes
is their objective, has resulted in
the complete encircling of the vil
lage of Deniecourt, the Paris war
office announced today.
Deniecourt former the center of
the wedge the French are driving
into the German lines north of
Chaulnes, its resistance holding
up their advance between Berny
and V ermandovillers, complete
occupation of which villages by |
the French was announced last
night.
Counter Attacks Repulsed.
Further progress has been made by
the French in this region and heavy
counter attacks by the Germans on the
new French positions, both north and
south of the Somme, have been re
pulsed. according to today's report,
which announces that the Germans
sustained enormous losses, two bat
talions being nearly wiped out. The
French have taken 1,200 prisoners and
ten machine guns.
The British are keeping up their for
ward push north of the Somme, scoring j
their advances, however, at isolated
points, apparently In operations to
straighten their line and secure their
hold on captured ground.
Further Gains by British.
In small operations on the Somme
front last night the British gained
further ground, the war office an
nounced today.
"The general situation continues un
changed." the announcement says.
"South of the Ancre we Improved our

Germans I>ose Heavily.
I PARIS, September IS, noon.?The
Germans lost heavily in several counter
attacks north and south of the Somme
last night, the war office announced to
[ day. The French maintained the
ground recently won and made further
progress near Clery and Berny. and on
the eastern edge of Deniecourt.
Prisoners report that enormous losses
have been susptained by some of the
Uermar. formations. The statement
says two battalions were almost anni
hilated by the French artillery.
The French took 1,200 prisoners and
ten ma. hine guns, the statement says.
Th? town of Deniecourt Is now com
pletely encircled by the French.
Germans, Hidden in Dugouts,
Refuse to Surrender Even
When Surrounded by Foe
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
1 FRANCK, September 17, via London.
September 18.?The British today took
I the Mouquet farm. On two former oc
casions they had been on the premises,
i but were unable to remain there. It
was a strong point on the right of the
British battle line, where a garrison of
Germans and their machine guns
seemed proof against shellflre.
Thev had the usual deep cellars and
runways underground, and, driven
from one ?xtt by shelllire. they would
emerge from another. The British got
"nt"?W around their burrows ami
called down the cellar stairs for them
to surrender.
Befused to Surrender.
The Germans thought that a counter
attack would come to their assistance
as before. The British, however, as
sured them that none would come, as
they had the trench all the way around
the farm to prevent their exit or aid
from coming to them. Still the Ger
mans refused to yield, and the nnal
result of this grim colloquy was that
*
J i
the British blew in all the cellar floors.
But such persistent diggers are the
Germans that the British are not cer
tain but they had some underground
passage for escape.
The British also cleaned up the Dan
ube trench In the old German first line
near Thiepval, which is the hinge of
the Somme battle line. As happened
before and after the fierce general at
tack along the whole front, the suc
ceeding days are spent in rectifying
the line and cleaning up any strong
points that still hold out.
Combles Attack Denied.
The German official report of Fri
day's battle made peculiarly interest
ing reading here. It spoke of repuls
ing an English attack on Combles. The
correspondent happened to be at that
end of the line, where he could ob
serve the action, and no British infan
try moved on Combles. Small bodies
of British infantry have been in both
the villages of Les Boeufs and Gueude
court, beyond Flers, which was taken ,
Friday, and the British line is now
close to these villages.
Talking with officers of corps en
gaged in the fighting of the last three
days, they estimate the losses from
two to one to five to one for the Ger- !
mans as against those of the British.
In one sector the ratio was estimated
as high as eight to one. The superior
volume of the British shellfire, now
that the Germans are forced into the
open, has a telling effect.

As there were not enough boats for j
both the crew and the Americans, who
were engaged as hostlers for the cargo

BROKEN HEART CAUSES DEATH.
John Agnew. 84, Grieved Over Being
Placed on Pension Roll.
CHICAOO, September 18.?A "broken
heart." because he had no work to do.
was said to have been the cause of the
death of John Agnew, aged eighty-four,
i
by his son. July 1 last Agnew, after
sixty-four years' service for the city,
went on the pension roll.
"I have nothing to live for now," he
is quoted by his son as having said.
"Rather than quit I would work for
nothing."
But the municipal pension law had
to be enforced. John Agnew had to
step down and out.
In the council chamber of the city
hall, a few days later, Mr. Agnew rer*
ceived his first pension check. The oc
casion was celebrated by various speak
er's, including Mayor Thompson. When
they congratulated Agnew on his long
service his eyes filled with tears.
"This idleness is killing me," he told
his son later. "I'm afraid I'll never get
used to it. What a blessing is work,
work, work."
Members of his family tried to cheer
him up, but he grew worse and yester
day died.
SAYS THE IDEA IS UNSOUND.
I. N. Stevens Condemns Scheme of
Government or Social Insurance.
WHITE SULPHfR SPRINGS, Va..
September 18.?Schemes for govern
mental or social insurance were attack
ed at the annuaj convention of the In
ternational Association of Casualty and
Surety Underwriters here today by
Isaac Newton Stevens of Denver, who
contended that insurance was not a
legitimate government function under
a republic and that the whole idea was
unsound.
Mr. Stevens, who is well known as a
lawyer and writer, said that although
he was a champion of government
operation of many enterprises, he had
after thorough investigation been un
able to ascertain "any real or specula
tive justification for any branch of our
government engaging in the insurance
business." He thought the advocacy of
social insurance in this country was an
other instance of the fact that "we have
a penchant for copying most everything
attempted across the Atlantic, regard
less of the purpose or motive or form
of government or dissimilarity in
popuuar aims and ideals of the Euro
pean law-making bodies from those of
our own country."

INTERNAL REVENUE SHOWING.
Bureau "Recovers"' Taxes Equal in
Amount to Cost of Service.
Secretary McAdoo has issued a state
ment saying that during the fiscal years
1914, 1915 and 1916 the internal revenue
bureau recovered more than enough
taxes to meet the entire expenses of the
service. For the three years mentioned
the total cost of the bureau, in and out
of Washington. was approximately
$19,800,000. Revenue recovered amount
ed to $21,000,000.
In the fiscal year 1916 the cost of col
lecting internal revenue receipts was
only 1.40 per cent, the average cost
for 1914, 1915 and 1916 being 1.51 per
cent.

Both Parties Tomorrow Will
Choose Candidates for the
November Election.
PROGRESSIVE SHOWING
SIGNIFICANT FEATURE
Contest Spirited on the Republican
Side for Governor and United
States Senator.
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
NEW YORK, September 18.?
Tomorrow the voters of the state
of New York who voted in the
fall elections of a year ago, and
are therefore enrolled, will choosc
the men who are to stand in the
elections of next November as
candidates of the respective politi
cal parties for governor, United
States senator, representatives in
Congress and members of the
state legislature.
The official enrollment shows 738,631
republicans, 651,S53 democrats and 46,
206 progressives on the lists. There
are also 29,323 socialists. 20.5S4 prohi
bitionists, 8,494 independents and 1,711
American party voters.
A significant feature of these figures
is the showing of the progressive en
rollment. In 1912 the progressive vote
as cast for Roosevelt, and which, of
course, included some democrats, was
390.92L The combined Taft and Roose
velt vote was 845,449 and the Wilson
vote was 655,475. In the gubernatorial
elections of 1914 the democratic vote
was 412,253, and the' republican, 686,
701, while 70,655 went to Sulzer, who
was running independently.
Progressive Banks Depleted.
So it appears that there are only
46.000 progressives still holding to
their party affiliation in the state. The
remainder of the 390,000 who voted for
Roosevelt have returned to the old
affiliation, and the figures show that
the republican party claimed the great
mass of them. In tomorrow's pri
maries the voters will have to vote as
they are enrolled, but in the election
in November they will not be so bound,
but can vote without respect to their
party designation in the enrollment.
jir-^Gov. Whitman, republican incumbent,
is a candidate for renomlnation, and
is also seeking nomination by the pro
gressives. He is being opposed in his
own party by William M. Bennett.
Judge Samuel Seabury is unopposed
for the democratic nomination for gov
ernor, and he also is asking for sup
port of the progressives.
The progressives of the state have
been considered hostile to Gov. Whit
man and friendly to Judge Seabury, and
to such an extent as to cause apprehen
sion to the governor's friends that the
progressives might vote the demo
cratic gubernatorial ticket in Novem
ber. There was deemed sufficient
ground for fear to cause Col. Roose
velt to issue a formal statement, call
ing upon his fellow progressives to
support Whitman as against Seabury. on
the ground that a vote for Seabury is a
vote for President Wilson, and the re
election of President Wilson, according
to the colonel, would be a "grave na
tional calamity.
Contest for U. S. Senatorship.
The contest for the United States sen
atorship nomination is very keen on the
republican side. Former Representative
William M. Calder of Brooklyn was
slated for the senatorship nomination by
| the organization, and no one was con
testing the general understanding until
very recently, when the so-called "high
brow" element in the party, as differen
tiated from the "machine," concluded
that as a republican victory seems as
sured Mr. Calder was not senatorial
timber for the Empire state, so they put
up former Assistant Secretary of State
Robert Bacon to run.
It is a strightout tight between the
machine and the independent republi
cans. with such men as Elihu Root, Mr.
Choate and the bigwigs of the bar as
sociation for Bacon and the organiza
tion for Calder. ?
On the Democratic Side.
On the democratic side William F.
"McCombs, former democratic national
chairman, and the man who conducted
President Wilson's fight for the nomi
j nation at Baltimore, is the candidate
of the organization, while Thomas F.
j Conway is opposing him. Mr. McCombs
has the support of Charles F. Murphy,
and the politicians realize a sense of
grim humor in the Tammany boss' se
lection of Mr. McCombs. in view of the
widespread belief that it was not ac
ceptable to the White House, as the
public generally accepts the report that
Mr. McCombs has been dropped by the
administration, whether it be true or
not.
Mr. McCombs will loyally support
President Wilson, however, when nomi
nated as candidate for senator, as it
Is conceded he will be. He will make
a whirlwind campaign, and will utilize
all the experience he gained in con
ducting the Wilson national campaign

CHICAGO, September t8.?
Confession has been made by two
members of the alleged syndicate
of blackmailers, eight of whom
are under arrest here, that opera
tions of the swindlers nertted them
Si,000,000 during the last year,
federal officials announced today.
The confessions, it was said,
disclosed that the alleged band
numbers sixty persons, a third of
them women. A dispute over the
division of spoils, it was said, led
to the confessions. Arrest of a
score or more members of the
syndicate are expected within a
week.
The men who confessed are "Dlclfc^'
Barren and Edward J. Thompson, ?c
? v! 10 ^'n'on *?? Clabaugh, head of
the Chicago bureau of the federal De
partment of Justice. Both are at
liberty. They will become witnesses for
the government however, when the
eight members of the alleged syndicate
arrested in the raid on a fashionable
apartment hotel Saturday night, are
brought to trial. Mr. Clabaugh said.

will be required to give, are: Edward

Operations Beached Beyond U. S.
Operations of the syndicate which
now appears to have been of interna
tional proportions were not confined to
the blackmail of wealthy men and
women, according to information de
veloped today. Among the eftects in
the office of "Doc" Edward Donahue
one of the men caught in the Saturday
night raid, was stationery of the
"United Turf Exchange," with "Head
quarters in New York and offices all
over the world." There were also ci
pher codes for deciphering messages re
ceived by wire, telling what horses to
bet on. how much to. bet, what races
and positions to play.
Fake newspaper clippings detailing
the wonderful clean-ups made by a
young eastern plunger in poolrooms
apparently had been used to lure vic
tims. One letter found in Donahue'*
room, at the fashionable South Side
apartment house, was from the "Horse
man's Association" of 1468 Marke*
street Louisville. Ky? signed bv J C
Saulsberry. secretary, and addressed to
A. T. Karger. The secretary said he
was sorry to hear of "Mr. Kargers no
toriety lately, and hoped he wouldn't
nave another occurrence like that
again." It seemed that "Mr. Karger's"
picture had appeared in a newspaper In
conection with bookmaking activities
at the races.
According to Department of Justle*
officials here today, the "United Turf
mus* have been an exclusive
flZVr J fl" Ktate(1 that members
using the cluhrooms in the evening
must appear in full dress. Evidently
the "Horseman's Association" was
known in Louisville as a grain bro
kerage house.
How Wagers Were Placed.
Code books showed how wagers on
horses could be placed, and there was
apparently no limit. If the bettor
wanted to place $50,000 on a horse he
would order fifty boxes of red. white
or blue matches, the color depending
on the position to bet on the horses
vis., red, straight; blue, place; white,
show. ^
Condition of track was described as
follows: Dry. oats; muddy, corn; me
dium, rye. If all these elaborate sys
tems were not enough to beguile the
victim the *'ake newspaper clipping was
flashed. T?ie headlines of this article
stated thai a "young eastern plunger
cleaned up *80,000 from Seattle, Wash.,
poolrooms. Identity of man not known
to local gambling fraternity." The
story then went on that all efforts to
get information from him had been
fruitless. He had never lost a bet.
Here it was, according to the Depart
ment of Justice officials here today,
that Donahue broke into the game. He
would claim to be the mysterious
stranger from the east.
Got $40,000 From One Man.
According to the federal authorities
today here are some of the things done
by the syndicate: They fleeced a multi
millionaire oI New York out of $40,000
by threatening him with arrest for al
leged violation of the Mann act, two of
the members of the syndicate imper
sonating secret service agents for that
purpose. v
They frightened a wealthy Philadel
phia woman who had been totTfriendly
with a stranger in a cafe into giving
