OPERATIONS ARE GOING AGAINST
MILLION A MOUTH
Will be Required of Americans to
Help Keep Belgians Alive
' . ' During the Winter
(Associated Press)
New York, Sept. 18 Believing that
the war will continue at least another
full year, the commission for relief in
Belgium announced today that it faces
the necessity of asking and soon will
ask the American people to give a
million dollars every month in order
to avert widespread sickness and
death from lack, of proper food.
To date the United States has con
tributed an average of less than half
a million amonth, while the commis
sion's purchases in this country, thru
funds provided from other countries,
have lately averaged over ten mill
ions of dollars a month.
W. L. Honnojd, who has just arriv
ed in New York to succeed Captain
J. F. Lacey as -director of the com
mission in America, after having
filed a similar position in London,
says: . .
"If the children of Belgium and
Northern France are to grow to
healthy maturity, they must be pro
vided with more food than is now
supplied to them, and to this end the
commission for relief in Belgium will
soon ask the people of the - United
States to give at least one million
dollars monthly toward the cost of a
special meal which will be served
every day in the schools."
MAXWELL CARS
AID BILLY SUNDAY
The Baseball Evangelist Says that
Automobiles Make a. Bigger
Campaign , Possible
Billy Sunday, the baseball evange
list, realizes the value of the automo
bile in conducting his great religious
revivals throughout the country. Dur
ing his recent campaign in Kansas
City, Mr. Sunday and his aides used
a Maxwell Sedan constantly during
his stay in the Missouri city.
The evangelist was immensely
pleased with the service rendered by
his car. - In fact, he was so pleased,
that he wrote an appreciation to the
company. His letter follows:
"I wish it were possible to have
every one generally understand how
much you have contributed to the suc
cess of the campaign here in Kansas
City. It would not have been possi
ble for me to speak as many, times
and as many places but for the ex
cellent automobile service you fur
nished. "The cars have been dependable,
reliable' and comfortable. They have
always been in order, clean, attrac
tive, and we have had no trouble or
delay at any time. I thank you most
heartily.
"I had no , idea that a light, inex
pensive car could arouse so much ad
miration as the Maxwell has done.
With best wishes for your continued
success and with kind regards.
"Sincerely yours, W. A. Sunday."

DEPARTMENT
(Associated
Chicago, Sept. 18. Further arrests
are expected in connection with the
so-called "blackmail syndicate," which
raids here Saturday night by United
States department of justice officials
exposed. The woman member of the
"syndicate" is believed to be in St.
Louis. Los Angeles authorities have
been asked to locate the sender of a.
telegram to Helen Evers, one of the
women arrested. ,
Information developed today indi
cated that operations were not confin
ed to the blackmail of wealthy men
and women. In the office of Edward
Donahue, one of the men arrested,
was some stationery of the "United
Turf Exchange," with "headquarters
in New York and offices all over the
world."
OPERATIONS ON LARGE SCALE
Dick Barrett and Edward J. Thomp-!

OPTIMISTIC AS EVER
Mr. R. S. Hall Believes the Silver-
Lined Cloud is About to be
Turned Inside Out
This section of the country has seen
the worst of the distressful condi
tions resulting from the war in Eu
rope, and better days are here, accord
ing to Mr. R. S. Hall, of this city,
whose interests put him in toueh with
conditions in this and other states.
Mr. Hall is highly optimistic, and be
lieves the times will steadily improve.
The evidence is to be seen on all sides,
he says.
In an interview given a represen
tative of the Star, Mr. Hall stated
that he expected to see a big tourist
season in Florida this winter, and
Ocala, he said, will get its share. The
remarkably fine weather which was
had last winter has advertised Flor
ida as only first hand evidence and
word of mouth can, and many who
came to this state last season will re
turn this season and bring their
friends with them. Although new
hotels and winter residences have
been built since last season, as a re
sult of the million or more tourists
that crowded the state, fears have al
ready been expressed of the inability
to take care of the crowds this winter.
Mr. Hall spoke of the large crops.
He spoke of the good prices for cot
ton, and turpentine. The citrus fruit
crop of the state will be a large one,
he said. The live stock industry, he
said, will be given a strong impetus
by the establishment in Jacksonville
of the packing plant of Armour & Co.

MARCUS FRANK'S
LATEST MOVE
Intends Going to New York but Will
Not Neglect his Large and Well
Conducted Business in Ocala
Frank's, one of the best known
stores in this section of the state, will
from now on be known as "the store
where styles are shown first." The
men's clothing and furnishing depart
ment has been done away with, and
heerafter Frank's will be exclusively
a woman's store.
Mr. Marcus Frank will leave about
October 10 for New York City, where
he has purchased a one-third interest
in a wholesale glove and handkerchief
house. He will continue his ownership
of his business here, which will be in
charge of his brother-in-law, Mr. Max
Israelson. Mr. Frank will not relin
quish any of his business interests or
real estate holdings here, and will
continue his citizenship in Ocala. In
New York Mr. Frank will do the buy
ing for his store here, and, as he says,
he will be in a position to watch the
markets closely and keep his stock
here new and up to the minute. As
soon as something new for women ap
pears iii New York it will be purchas
ed by Mr.Trank and shipped to Ocala.
Mrs. Frank will remain in this city
for six or eight months longer, before
joining Mr. Frank in New York.
Mr. Frank came to Ocala 17 years
ago, when the Boston Store was es
tablished here by his mother, where
the Court Pharmacy now is. In 1905
he formed a partnership with Mr.'
Thomas Harris, and the "Variety
Store" was opened; Mr. Frankpur
chasing Mr. Harris' interest in 1908,
since when the store has been known
as "Frank's." Mr'. Frank has been in
the dry goods business all of his life,
and knows it thoroughly.
The many friends' of Mr. Frank and
his family regret that they will no
longer make their home in this city.
They do not desert Ocala entirely,
however, for Mr. Frank " expects to
make frequent business trips here.
Mr. Frank has always taken an in
terest in Ocala and hasdone much
for this city. He is a member of the
board of trade and has held office in
that organization.
THE AUTO TRUCK
SAVED A HOUSE
This morning about 8:30 o'clock the
fire department was called to the
home of Mr. Henry Gordon on the ex
treme south end of Orange avenue. On
the arrival of the fire apparatus the
roof of the kitchen, which set off from
the main house a few feet was found
in a blaze. To reach the house it was
necessary to lay hose from South
Eighth street for a distance of 1500
feet, and it was only after hard work
on the part of the firemen, with both
chemical apparatus and water, that
the blaze was confined to the kitchen
with only about $75 damage.
This fire demonstrated the worth of
the new auto truck. When horses
were used only 1100 feet of hose was
carried on the wagon which would not
have been sufficient to have, reached
the house. The driver would have had
to return to the station and load extra
hose and the firemen say that the
blaze would have been beyond control
by the time the extra hose arrived.
The new truck, however carries 1700
feet of hose, which gave the firemen
200 feet to spare, and allowed them to
save the house entirely and the kitch
en with only a small loss.
During the fire Capt. Louis Keef e,
who was only a short time ago severe
ly burned by the explosion of a gaso
line torch at the station, and has just
recently been able to resume his post,
had his left arm badly cut by a fall
ing window.

ARTISTS AID IN
MAKING AMMUNITION
Famous Porcelain Factory at Sevres
Enlisted in the Defense
-of
France
(Associated Press)
Paris, Sept. 18. The - world-famed
national porcelain factory at Sevres
has suddenly been transformed into
part of the huge war machine. In
stead of making those dainty and
fragile statuettes and vases which
are the wonder of art collectors, it is
turning out "poteries de guerre," or
earthenware retorts and cauldrons
for manufacturing asphyxiating gas
and for all the various chemical pro
cesses of producing high explosives.
Even the famous artists whose names
are associated with the delicate col
oring of Sevres porcelain, are now ex
ercising their art in enameling these
huge retorts so as to make them
more resistant to theacids and chem
icals used in the war processes.
Early in the war, Mr. Bourgeois,
administrator of Sevres, learned that
the production of high explosives for
artillery was falling short owing to
the lack of earthen receptacles capa
ble of treating the acids. He there
fore proposed to the minister of fine
arts, M. Dalimer, that the art work of
Sevres be suspended and all its ener
gies given to producing the recep
tacles needed for powder-making.
This was approved and soon the
transformation was begun.
Sevres has gone through a ' com
plete transformation, and is today
furnishing thousands of receptacles
of all sorts in which powder, explo
sives and gases of all sorts are manu
factured and stored. With a staff
less than half its usual strength, the
production of Sevres is five times as
great today as.it was before the war.
And besides the great quantity of its
war output, the quality of its works
is making it a sort of expert school
for the engineers of the various pow
der factories. The chief workers of
these factories now come to Sevres
to study the chemical methods em
ployed in hardening clays and mak
ing them more resistant to high tem
perature. Odd Fellows meet tomorrow night.
