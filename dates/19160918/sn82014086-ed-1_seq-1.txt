their front here to within a scant mile
of Grnndcourt and the Albert-Ia-Taume

TIDEWATER BOATMEN
VOTETO GO ON STRIKE
Demand Eetter Working Conditions
and Increased Pay.
New York, Sept. 17. The Tidewater
Boatmen's Union, with a membership,
it was said, of 3,000, tonight voted to
go on strike. No date was set for the
men to quit work, this being left, it
was said, until after a conference be
tween delegates of the union and the
executive board of the Longshoremen's
Union tomorrow night.
The strike, it was asserted, will be
in no way a sympathetic one with the
carmen who quit their places on Sept.
6, but will result from a demand ft
better working conditions and in
creased pay. Although the men claim
to handle all the coal received in the
city at tidewater, the fact, they said,
that the coal supply of the local tran
sit companies may be endangered, was
only incidental.
Heads of the transit lines declared
tonight that the strike of the carmen
was ineffective. Service on subway
and elevated lines continued normal
and steady improvement was noted on
all surface roads.
Few attempts at violence were re
ported by the police today. Several
mass meetings were held in various
parts of the city but there was no dis
order. At one gathering the "financial
and moral" support of the Socialist
party was assured to the striking car
men. BRITISH ARE USING
TRAVELING LAND FORTS
Steel Land Ship cf Immense Power
and Wonderful Capacity.
London, Sept. IS, 3.4$ a. m. Credit
for tho new "traveling land forts"
which have been used during the last
few days on the British front, belongs
to two men, Lieutenant Colonel E. D.
Swinton. of the Intelligence depart
ment of the general staff, and Major
Stern. Lieutenant Colonel Swinton
will lie remembered as one of the offi
cer "eye witnesses" who wrote ac
counts of the early days around Ypres
for British newspapers. Major Stern
is a business man who has been for
come time in the employ of the gov
ernment. The Daily Mail describes
the new monsters as follows:
- "These long, low, dust-coiored tor
toises have no resemblance to motor
cars. They are, in fact, steel land
ships of immense power ad wonderful
capacity. In practice they can climb
walls, push through dense woods, cross
trenches ana manoeuvre m and out of
craters. One of the most remarkable
frot about them is the secrecy with
which the making of their thousands
of parts was veiled in the midland
town of their birth. Ths army likes
them, but it is not placing too much
reliance on what is for the present
only an experiment."

RUMOR THAT BREMEN
WAS N EARING NEW LONDON
Tugs Went Out, But No Submarine
Was Sighted.
Xew London, Conn., Sept. 17. A
persistent report from apparently re
liable sources that the German under
sea merchantman Bremen was ap
proaching this podt tonight lacked
confirmation at a late hour. The first
report stated that a submarine was
seen off Fishers Island at 9 o'clock,
headed for New London, a two hours
run. Credence was attached furth
er when the ocean-going tug T. A.
Scott, Jr., put out to sea under hurried
orders.
A newspaper tug, which followed the
T. A. Scott, Jr., returned just before
midnight with the information that
there was a heavy fog over the sound
and nothing had- been seen of a sub
marine. At midnight the T. A. Scott,
Jr.. had not returned.
During the day one of the United
States submarines was manoeuvering
off Block Island but returned here
early in the evening. It is believed
that this submarine's actions may
have given rise to the rumor of the
approach of tho German boat.

two hours before it was learned that

Other Paper, and Its
tory of a Man
Who "Came Back"
FORMER BRITISH OFFICER JOINED
FRENCH ARMY AS PRIVATE
REGAINED HIS HONORS
Colonel John Ford Elkington Had Been
Dismissed by Courtmartial After
Thirty Years of Service Is Now in
England.
London, Sept. 8 (Correspondence of
The Associated Press). All England
is ringing with the story of Lieuten
ant Colonel John Ford Elkington one
of the strangest romances of this
strange world war. It is the ever
appealing, human etory of a man who
"came back."
Dismissed by court martial from the
army he had served for nearly thirty
years, just as his regiment was going
into action in France in the closing
months of 1914, this Fngiiyti officer,
disgraced .at a time of life when the
chances of fate weigh heavily against
a man fighting for suddenly lost hon
or, found refuge in that queerest of all
military organizations, the foreign
legion of Franco.
Lost in the Maze.
Lost in the mazes of the western
battlefields a mere legionnaire in the
ranks Colonel Elkington, late of the
Royal Warwickshire;, was all but for
gotten. Xone of his old friends, his
old fellow officers, none of the men
who had seen him win the queen's
medal for valor in South Africa, none
of these knew that Elkington was out
there, "somewhere in France," reck
lessly winning his way back.
Errors Wiped Out.
But now Elkington is back in Eng
land. Pinned on his bn-ast ,re two of j
the coveted honors of Fjnnee 'the I
military medal and the military cross:
but moet valued possession of all is a
bit of paper which wipes out the er
rors of the past a proclamation from
the official London Gazette announcing
that the king has "graciously approved
the reinstatement of Jchn Ford Elk
ington in the rank of lieutenant col
onel, with his previous seniority, in
consequence of his gallant conduct
while serving in the ranks of the for
eign legion of the French army." Xot
only has Colonel Elkington been re
stored to the army, but he has been
reappointed to hi sold regiment, tho
Royal Warwickshires, in which his
father served before him.
Had Been Cashiered.
In this same London Gazette, at tho
end of Octuber,- 1014, had Appeared
the crushing annfmncement that Elk
ington had been cashiered by sentence
of general court martial. What his
error was did not appear at the time
and has not been alluded to in his
returned hour of honor. It was a court
martial at the front at a time when
the first rush of war was engulfing
Europe and little time could be wasted
upon an incident of this sort. The
charge, it is now stated, did not re
flect in any way upon the officer's
personal courage. But with fallen for
tunes he passed quietly out of the
army and enlisted in the legion that
corps where thousands of brave but
broken men have found a shelter, and
now and then an opportunity to make
themselves whole n.gain.
Knees Are Shattered.
Colonel Elkington did not pass un
scathed through fir.-!. His fighting days
are ended. His knees are shattered
and be walks heavily upon his sticks.
"They are just 'fragments from
France,' 'r he eaid of those wounded
knees.
Colonel Elkington made no attempt
to cloak his name or his former armv
service when lie entered the ranks of
uie legion.
"Why shouldn't I be a private?" he
said. It is an honor for any man to
serve in the ranks of that famous
corps. Like many of the other boys, I
uau a aeoi to wipe olt. Xow it i
paid."

OBITUARY.
- " Seth Low.
New York, Sept. 17. Seth Low,
former mayor of New York and one
time president of Columbia University,
died late today at his country home,
Broad Brook Farm, Bedford Hills, N.
Y., at the age of 66 years. He had
been ill several months of a compli
cation of diseases. A change for the
worse was announced last night and
it was then said the patient probably
could not recover.
Mr. Low's most recent activities
were exerted in an effort to find a so
lution of the. differences between the
railroad brotherhoods and the rail
roads. He had long been consulted by
heads of the brotherhoods.
Mr. Low's illness was attributed by
his friends to a general breakdown.
Since the outbreak of the European
war he had been specially active as
president of the New York chamber of
commerce and president of the Na
tional Civic Federation. He was
chairman of the executive committee
of Tuskegee Institute, delegate-at-large
to the recent New York state
constitutional convention and a mem
ber of a government appointed to in
vestigate labor troubles in Colorado.
As chairman of the committee on
city government in the constitutional
convention, Mr. Low is said to have
worked continuously for six months
many hours of the day and night. For
three months prior to his illness, he
devoted himself almost exclusively to
trying to find a solution to the dif
ferences between the railroad brother
hoods and their employers. Even after
he was stricken he kept in touch with
the brotherhood heads, Samuel Gom
pers, president of the American Feder
ation of Labor, and other union lead
ers with whom he was on terms of
intimate friendship. Until his illness
assumed an acute stage several w-eeks
ago Mr. Low busied himself with plans
of the National Civic Federation, in
which he was deeply interested.
Mrs. Low and other members of the
household were with him when he died.
Arrangements for the funeral have not
been completed.

American and - Mexican--members- of ,
the Joint commission studying here the!

fident tonight that material progress

considered improbable.

spent the week end. and Dr. Johji B.

days, is expected here when the ses

internal affairs and it is not believed i
the Mexican representatives will offer!
serious objection. Questions affecting!
property rights of foreigners in Mex-
Ico will be raised, perhaps tomorrow,
and an effort made by the Americans;
to ascertain the ideas ot the 'Mexicans;
relative to a means of adjusting claims I
of American property owners in Mex- i
led. To advise with them on this sub-
ject and others touching upon thej
