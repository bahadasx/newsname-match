VILLA IN COMMAND
Hand to Hand Fighting in
the Surprise Attack on
Chihuahua City.
El Paso, Texas, Sept. 1S Two
columns of povernment cavalry
under General Matias Ramos and
Colonel Jose .Marrero today were
pursuing- Villa and his main hand,
which Saturday made the Hidalgo
day attack on Chihuahua City, ino
the Santa Clara canyon district to
the northeast, according to re
ports to General Francisco Gon
zales, commandant in Juarez. The
bandits were well mounted and
apparently were leading the de
facto forces over the jasrged rocks.
Today's reports indicated that
Villa's force numbered approximately
1,500 and was opposed by the garri
son of about 7,000. From the number
of dead and wounded picked up by the
pursuing forces, it was estimated the
Villa casualties were about 250.
Villa himself directed the attack,
according to the dispatches, but did
not enter the town, remaining across
the Rio Churiscar to the northwest
with a few hundred of his reorganized
"gold ones." Much damage was done
to the penitentiary and the municipal
and federal palaces, which the ban
dits succeeded in capturing before the
surprised members of the garrison,
who had been participating in an In-
e day celebration, rallied-.-'
Rifles were useless in the hand-to-
hand street fighting which followed,
the reports said. Pistols and Bare
fists were used as the two commands
struggled through the early morning
hours in the rain. When finally the
artillery fire, which General Trevino
directed from Santa Rosa, a fortified
hill to the west of the city, had forced
the Villistas to retire, they left the
streets behind them cobbled with their
dead.
Look for Bandit Salazar.
Search today was being made among
the bodies in an attempt to identify
prominent outlaw leaders, an especial
effort being made to find trace of Jose
Inez Salazar, known as "the perpetual
revolutionist," who was held in the
penitentiary on a charge of treason
and released in the attack.
The bandits had made an orderly re
treat into the outskirts of the city
when they again came into the line of
government artillery fire, this time
from the twin hills of N ombre de
Dios. The retreat immediately became
a rout, dispatches say.
Rumors current here that a part of
the Carranza garrison has joined
Villa were denied at the Juarez com
mandancia. Physicians attending Gen
eral Trevino, who sustained a wound
in the arm, said that his injuries were
slight.
Also Attack Guerrero.
Fl Paso. Tex,, Sept. IS. A small
band of Villistas made a "Hidalgo day"
attack on Guerrero. SO miles west of
Chihuahua City, but w ere repulsed and
fell back across the line of Mexico
Northwestern railway toward the foot
hills of the continental divide, pillag
ing isolated ranches as they went, ac
cording to private advices here today.
Recent reports received lu re have as
serted that American cavalry scouting
patrols have been operating between
Guerrero and Namiquipa. Tho patrols
were, sent south from El Valle, the
southernmost American base, in re
sponse to reports that Villa himself
was leading the bandit band in that
vicinity.
It was not considered probably, how
ever, that the. American patrols would
encounter the bandits.
El Paso. Texas, Sept. IK. A detach
ment of 20 Villa cavalrymen engaged
Carranza infantry men on the second
floor of the state palace, according to
additional details of the attack upon
Chihuahua City received here today
by Andreas Garcia, Mexican consul.
The bandits rod" their horses into
the building and up the stone steps to
the second floor in pursuit of the gov
ernment guard, which fell back before
them. De facto marksmen picked off
six of the mounted bandits as they
rode into one of the rooms, the re
mainder making their escape, but not
until several horses also had been
killed, it was stated.
The consular dispatches added that
Jose Inez Salazar, notorious Mexican
leader, was killed following his libera
tion from the penitentiary. Among the
bandits captured by de facto troops and
later executed, it was stated, was Col
onel Mariano Tames, who several
months ago led a revolt.

STUDY OF PLANS
American Party Wish Stress Laid on
Internal Affairs of Mexican
People.
New London, Conn., Sept. 18. When
the Mexican-American commissioners
resumed their conference today there
was reason to believe the Mexican rep
resentatives were prepared to insist
that their deliberations be directed to
ward an agreement on control of the
border.
The American representatives, be
lieving that the horder situation was
merely incident to the general condi
tions in Mexico, had planned toe con
tinue their stuffy of Mexico's internal
affairs.
Luis Cabrera, chairman of the Mexi
can delegation, presided today.
Luis Cabrera, chairman of the
Mexican delegation, who presided to
day, admitted that reports of the dis
cussion of the internai affairs of his
country had brought to him an inquiry
from his government as to why the
border question was not made para
mount. The American members, convinced
that the border conditions are inti
mately related to the internal affairs
of Mexico, had planned to direct the
discussion today along the lines of so
cial and economic divisions in an ef
fort to find a base for a solution that
might prove lasting. The Mexicans
entered the conference determined to
discuss only the border situation
which involves the question of the
withdrawal or the American troops.
The conference was resumed this af
ternoon. It was explained by those close to
the Mexican commissioners that such
discussion as had already taken place
regarding interior affairs of Mexico
was regarded by their government as
unwarranted.
Members of the American commis
sion did not regard the insistence of
the Mexican representatives in pre
ferring discussion of the border situa
tion as anything endangering the suc
cess of the conference.

Sank Vessel;
28 U.S. Men
New York, Sept, 18. A torpedo sank
the British ship Kelvinia, carrying 28
Americans, according to G. W. Dillard
of Richmond, Va, one of the Ameri
cans who arrived here today on the
Cunard liner Tuscania.
Dispatches from England left In
doubt the question whether the Kel
vinia, bound from Newport News, Va.,
to Glasgow, was torpedoed or sunk
by amipe on Sept. 2.
According to Dillard, the Kelvinia
was torpedoed at 2 o'clock in the
morning without warning. The vessel
listed immediately, and as there were
not enough lifeboats for both the crew
and the Americans, who were engaged
as hostlers for the cargo of horses,
many of the Americans put on life
belts and jumped overboard. They
were rescued by a trawler ofter float
ing for 14 hours.

000 within the last year, federal
officials announced today.
The confessions, It was declared,

confession. Arrest of a score or more
members of the syndicate Is expected
within a week.
The men who confessed are "Dick"
Barratt and Edward J. Thompson, ac
cording to Hinton G. Clabaugh, head
of the Chicago bureau of the federal
department of Justice. Both are at
liberty, he said. They will become
witnesses for the government, how
ever, when the eight members of the
syndicate arrested in a raid on a
fashionable apartment hotel Saturday
night are brought to trial.
Fear that they would receive long
prison sentences caused Thompson
and Barratt to confess, Clabaugh said.
Bail aggregating $100,000 has been
fixed for the eight members of the al
leged band now under arrest. They
are to be given a hearing tomorrow.
Those under arrest and the bail they

Explaining the methods of the black
mailers, Mr. Clabaugh said;
"Members of the band have fleeced
at least 15 prominent Boston, Phila
delphia and New York persons.
"The women members flirted with
wealthy men, got them into compro
mising positions and then demanded
money on threat of exposure. The
men did likewise with wealthy wo
men." Frank Crocker, a former member of
the gang, is now in custody in Phil
adelphia, officials said. William But
ler, alleged ringleader of the band,
also is reported under arrest in Phil
adelphia. Elaborate opium smoking layouts,
expensive silks and satin gowns and

ment in which the arrests were made.
Fifty suits of clothes hung in the
closet of Henry Russell. A mass of
incriminating evidence letters, tele
grarhs ami other papers were found,
officials sal'l.
The operations of the band Is de
clared to have extended from coast to
coast. Men and women alike have
been victims. Persons of wealth were
the objects in every case.
Five wealthy and social promi
nent members of Chicago's society are
declared to have been blackmailed out
of $20,000. Their names were with

victims have declared themselves
ready to testify in the case, Mr.
Clabaugh said. One of these ready is
Mrs. Regina Clipper of Philadelphia.
The five under arrest declined to
discuss the charges against them. Th
