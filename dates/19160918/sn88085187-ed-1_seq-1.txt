FIGHT ON
CO. FERRY
The biggest fight in tlie hear
ing of the county budget Oct. 2
promises to be over the $.10,000
item for the proposed county
ferry which has been included in
the tentative budget.
While Chairman Slayden Is
strongly In favor of the ferry as
a benefit to the city, as well as
to the residents and farmers of
the' Hay-Island district. Commis
sioner Reed is dead against it.
Reed claims that with ferry
slips it will cost at least $00,000
to operate il, and that the county
stands to lose $10,000 if it un
dertakes such a plan.
He declares that the ferry
across Lake Washington, which
handles much more traffic than
would be handled here, has
caused a loss to the county of not
less than $10,000 a year.
The budget also provides for
the children's ward of the tuber
culosis sanitorium to cost $25,
--000.

OH, YOU PUSSYFOOTER!
What's YOUR Idea On How
to Save This Scenic Gem?
By Mabel Abbott
One of the funniest things
about human nature is the way,
generation after generation, hind
sight continues to be better than
foresight.
If it were not for this little pe
culiarity of ours, streets would
never have to be dug up to put
down sewers; cities would never
have to purchase at great expense,
park and playground space which
could have been had much more
cheaply if they had only looked
ahead a little way; and a natural
wonder like Clear Lake, lying
within an hour and a half's ride
of a large city, would never be in
danger of permanent disfigure
ment.
As was told in Friday's Times,
logging operations have already
been begun on Clear Lake, the
900-foot-deep jewel on the Eaton
vllle road.
Jewel Without a Setting.
The timber around the lake Is
owned by the Bt. Paul ft Tacoma
Lumber Co., the Tidewater Log
ging Co. and the Northern Coast
Timber Co.
Without its timber, the lake
will atill be a geological wonder;
but It will be like a Jewel without
a setting. A waste of raw stumps
and sparse trees too worthless to

COUNCIL
HAD OTTA
WAKE UP
Members of the city council
awoke Monday to the fact that
the Pacific Telephone & Tele
graph Co. la working a hardship
on Tacoinans by replacing all
public telephones in downtown
business houses by nlckel-in-the
slot 'phones.
Somehow, tlie council didn't
read the papers a month or two
ago when the business men were
clamoring against this injustice.
The commissioners had never no-
ticed that these same business
men had hired an attorney and
had appealed to the public ser
vice commission for relief from
the increased rate.
So, with a lofty sensation of
doing a great piece of work for
the benefit of the common pee
pul, the council Monday took up
in grave debate the question of
the telephone company's latest
iniquitous act.
Commissioner Atkins ponder
ously wrote out a resolution call
ing upon the public service com
mission to relieve the public of
the Injustice of the five-cent
phones, and the councllmen calm
ly voted for It.
The public service commis
sion, however, will be somewhat
surprised at the council's resolu
tion, because it has already spent
a month working on the tele
phone matter, on request of Ta
coma business houses. Attorney
Burmelster has presented the
case to tbe commission.
