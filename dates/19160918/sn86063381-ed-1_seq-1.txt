THE BEMIDJI DAILY PIO
TRADE PAPER IN
ARTICLE PRAISES
COMMUNITY SPIRIT
INCITYOFBEMIDJI
Merchants Trade Journal Published
at Des Moines, Iowa, Has In
teresting Article.
GIVES ACCOUNT OF
PICNIC BY FARMERS
Praises Bemidji and Stand Taken by
Merchants: Small Mail Order
Problems.
The Merchants Trade Journal pub
lished at Des Moines, la., of which
W. J. Pilkington is editor, in its Sep
tember number contains a very in
teresting article in regard to the
"Spirit of Communityism" in Be
midji. The article is entiled "Nine
Farmers' Organizations, or Clubs, in
the Vicinity of Bemidji, Minnesota,
Give a Monster Annual Picnic to the
Retail Merchants of Bemidji.
The article gives an account of the
farmers' picnic given at the county
fair grounds July 21 of this year and
praises the farmers and the merch
ants for their co-operative stand.
"It has been truthfully said that
Bemidji is more than a city, that it
is a community," says the article.
"And the farmer who lives miles
away feels that Bemidji is his just
as much as do the men who run the
stores, the banks and offices of the
city.
"On the other hand, the merchant,
the banker, the doctor and all the
people of Bemidji feel that they are
a part of the farming community.
They feel they are a part of it they
helped to build it.
"Possibly there ^are other towns
and little cities that have as ideaf
conditions as Bemidji, but they are
hard to find, and probably there are
none that have developed this com
munity spirit as has Bemidji.
Could Profit Mnch.
"If those who wish to know could
have been in Bemidji June 21 when
the farmers' clubs of Beltrami county
gave a picnic at the fair grounds for
the Merchants association of Bemidji,
they could have learned many, many
things and could have profited very
much. They would have seen the
results of community interest devel
oped to the greatest degree. They
could have observed much that if ap
plied in their cities and their coun
ties would have made those cities
and those counties better places in
which to live better places in which
to accomplish that at which all are
aimingsuccess."
The article, which is lengthy, tells
of the formation of the picnic, how
the farmers enjoyed giving the pic
nic and how the merchants even more
enjoyed being the farmers' guests.
"Bemidji perhaps is fortunate in
having Bueford M. Gile as agricul
turist," says the Article. "His work,
of course, keeps him in close touch
with the farmers, their needs and
their thoughts. They come to him
for advice on farm topics and busi
ness topics, and he has made for him
self an excellent reputation."
The article is concluded as follows:
"So Bemidji, with her Merchants
club banquets and picnic with her
Parmer clubs' picnic with her good
fellowship organizations working
without the smallest bit of friction,
with all her townspeople the great
est friends with all her country peo
ple with her natural advantages
made known and thus made appre
ciated, has established that commu
nity spirit that is so vital to the
success of many community.
Bemidji hasnt' much of a mail order
problemif it has any it is so, small
that it is hard to uncover. Bemidji
doesn't have to worry about the
farmers of its community standing
by Bemidjibecause the farmers
around Bemidji know the residents
of Bemidji and knowing them, like
them. Because the residents of Be
midji (and that isn't confined to the
merchants) have helped and are help
ing the farmers of Bemidji territory,
the farmers are helping the residents
of Bemidji.
"Here one sees the community idea,
the community spirit and community
co-operation fully developed and
very, very productive of good."
