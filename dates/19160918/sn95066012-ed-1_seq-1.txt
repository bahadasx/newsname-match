Three Buhets Fired Into Back
Young Man's Head
County Officials Unable to Trace Perpetrator of
Ghastly Deed or Discover Motive for Shocking
Crime Victim Was Not Quarrelsome and So
Far As Known Had No Enemies
William Costello, 34 years old, an
employe In the washroom at the Hol
den, Leonard company woolen mill,
was shot and killed Saturday evening
near the Vermont soldiers' home
crossing of the Bennington and HoO
sick Falls division of the Berkshire
street railway system. Although an
investigation was begun before day
light Sunday morning and continued
through the entire day no clue that
might lead to the murderer has been
obtained and no motive for the crime
lias been discovered.
When found the body was lying
about twelve feet north of the high
way and about the same distance east
of the trolley track. The autopsy
held Sunday afternoon disclosed the
tact that the unfortunate man had
been shot three times in the back ol
the head but that only one of the bul
lets had Inflicted a fatal wound.
While the county oillcials have ob
tained little information of an en
couraging nature, they are satisfied
that the shooting look place at 9.30
o'clock i" the evening. Five shots in
quick succession were heard at that
hour by several persons and
the time is definitely fixed
through a comparison of their state
ments. The night watchman at the
Bennington Scale works who winds
his watchman's clock at !.30 heard the
shots as did Kdward McOuire who Is
employed In the local yard of the Rut
land railroad company. Patrick
Kearns, who was on his way home ;ii
the time, reported hearing the five
shots as did a young girl who Uvea
just north of the Oovernor Robinson
bridge.
Firing of the five shots is also con
firmed by the finding of Bve exploded
32-calibre cartridge shells near the
watering trough west of the soldier-'
.home. The bullets taken from Cos
tollo's head were 32-calbre. Finding
of the exploded shells would Indicate
that the murderer came back toward
the village after the commission of the
crime.
Although the time of the shooting is
fixed it was not until 11 o'clock that
the murder Itself became known In
the village. When the last trolley car
Into Bennington reached the crossing
shortly before 11. the rays from tin
headlight fell directly upon the man
lying beside the track. The light also
revealed blood on the faco. William
Bowers, the motorman. stopped tin
car and together with his conductor,
Bemis Powers, and Kugene Shea, jr
one of the two passengers, got out
with the intention of taking what they
Riiunosed was an injured man into
Itennlngton. They discovered that
the man. whom none of them knew
was either dead or nearly so. Without
disturbing the body t hoy returned to
the car which continued Its trip to
Pennington.
As the car came to a stop at Put
nam house sniiarn Chief of Police
Patrick Brazil was In the act of trying
the dnnr of the Quintan drug store.
Mr. Shea left the enr and at once In
formed the officer of the finding of the
body. Shea said ttiat bo thought the
man was dead as Ills forehead was
cold
Requisitioning Oeorgn Benedict's
car. Chief Brazil and Officer Andrew
Griffin. I)r John D. Lane and some
young men who were on the street at
the time hurried to the crossing. No
difficulty was experienced In estab
lishing the fact that the man was dead
but It was some time before any one
Identified the victim of the crime.
From the crossing the body was
taken directly to the Walbrldge un
dertaking room where Dr. Lane made
a preliminary examination. State's
Attorney Frank C Archibald was sum
moned from his home at Manchester
by telephone and arrived here about
2 o'clock Sunday morning to take
charge of the Investigation. Chief
Brazil and Officer Richard Hurley. Of
ficer Griffin. Deputy Sheriff John
Nash and Officer Patsey Perrott Im
mediately went to work on the ease
and kept at It during the remainder
of the day.
Or. n. H. 8tone. the state patholo
gist from the laboratory of hygiene it
Burlington arrived here by automobile
early Sunday afternoon and conducted
the autopsy. Dr. Stone found that
Costello had been shot three times
from behind. One bullet struck In the
side of the neck underneath the Jaw
and came through the upper Up. An
other striking the back of the head
failed to penetrate the skull hut
ranged around underneath the skin
and lodged In the chrek. A thfffl went
through the skull back of an ear and
passed through the braiu. This was
MURDERED HEAR
E
of
the fatal shot. The bullet was found
just back of the forehead and must
have traversed the whole bruin in its
course.
Following the autopsy, Dr. Same
and the state's attorney visited the
scene of the shooting and left late in
the afternoon for their homes at liur
lington and Manchester.
During the afternoon one arrest
was made but the man who had been
at work on the (ieorge Davis truck
farm easily proved that he could have
had no connection with the case and
was released.
If Costello was shot at 9.80 o'clock.
as the officials arc firmly convinced
was the case, the victim's movements
have been conclusively traced to
within 15, perhapa ten minutes, of the
instant that the crime was eotnmitted.
Between 'J o'clock and ten minutes
after 9 he called at the American
house bar and asked for matches,
he matches were given him by Rich
ard McKale. the bar tender. Costello
Inquired for Victor Young and was
told that ho had Just left the place.
Costello followed, caught up with
Young on River street and went with
him to the latter s home on County
street. Costello left the Young house
immediately alter his arrival. So
far as can be ascertained he was not
ugam seen alive. It Is difficult to
flume time and account for Costello's
presence at the crossing at H.30
o'clock, the hour when the five shots
wore fired. To leave the American
bouse after 9 o'clock, make one stop
On the way ami reach the spot where
he was Killed seems almost impos
sible. The distance is all of a half a
mile. It is positively stated by per
sons who saw Costello Saturday
night that he was not intoxicated.
Cars were running late over the
Bennington and Hootick Falls line
Saturday night. John Guidon, motor'
man on the local, between this village
and North Itennlngton. left here 20
minutes behind his schedule on his
!i o'clock run which would bring him
at the crossing In the vicinity of 9.35
lie saw two men apparently intoxicat
ed at the crossing and so notified tin
car run by William Powers and l!er-
nls Powers at the willow switch. Thi
crew of the east bound car saw noth
ing of the intoxicated men at the
crossing but when the' local returned
from .North Itennlngton Costello was
seen lying in the position in which
his body was found. Ilelieving that
the man was Intoxicated, not an infn
quent occurrence along the right of
WM on Saturday nights, the car was
not stopped and the man's presence
was not reported It was close to the
hour of II When the crime was dis
covered .
Were it possible to unearth s"im
motive for the crime, the officials
would not be so completely baffled In
their efforts to obtain some trace of
the murderer. Costello was an inof
fensive fellow without an enemy in
the world bo far as can be learned
lie had worked at the llolden. Leon
ard mill since he was a boy, probably
2" years. He had lived for some tiun
with his aunt. Mrs. Michael Mahar
of Mill street. He was a steady
worker, apt to drink more than was
good for him between uniting time
Saturday noon and Monday morning
but usually reporting lor duty with
the beginning of each week. He was
not particularly talkative, rather lone
Iv in his habits, generous with his
fib lids and did not frequent the bus!
ness section of the village to any great
extent. He was more than usually
near sighted.
Why a man of Costello's nature am
habits should be deliberately murder
ed in cold blood Is a problem that is
difficult of solution. Cntll the officers
are aide to obtain some motive It I
llkelv that they will make little pr
gress toward unraveling the mystcn
Thi' funeinl will be held from St
Framis dc Sales church at ! o'clock

A atorv that may help In running
down the criminal Is reported to hav
been told this forenoon by Kenneth
Hnswell. who lives on the North Ben
nliiRton toad. Mr. Haswell and Mrs
Hnswell were on their way home by
team from the village Saturday even
nlng between ! and 0.30 o'clock and at
the crossing where Costello's bod

The men were so taken up with the
argument that they did not make way

Henry C. Knapp of this village was al
most instantly lulled at the crossing
and three other occupants of an auto
mobile were seriously injured. Sep
tember 7. 1912, three men were killed
and several injured in a collison be
tween two Rutland railroad trains
within a hundred yards of the spot
where Costello's body was found. A
few hundred yards to the west Orson
Tinkham. a fanner living on the

abdomen. At the time the wound was
elieveu to be fatal but Tinkham lived
though he never fully recovered.

Rogers was later executed at the
state prison at Windsor. April 80,

TIME TO CUT FROSTED CORN
Any Delay Will Result in Great Loss
of Palatable Parts of the Plant.
Fields of frosted corn still standing
have been noticed recently by the
agiicultural adviser. Such fields
should be cut as soon as possible
The effect of the trost Is freezing the
cells of the plant tissues, causes the
breaking of the individual cells and
the evaporation of water that should
be left. The delay in cutting Hum
fields will result In a great loss of
the palatable parts of the plant, and
the leaves will become so brittle that
when handled a large percentage will
be lost by breaking and tailing to thi
ground. Should this i orn be ultilrzeil
for silage purposes, it should tie cut
iinmcdiatelv and put Into the silo as
soon as possible. It may require an
additional amount of moisture added
from the well. This is to prevent tor
mentation by allowing the com to
settle and so eliminate a large amount
of air which if left would enable un
d' sli aide bad' ri.i and fungi to d
velop rapidly.

THREE ARE BURNtD
TO DEATH II FIRE
IT EAGLE8RIB6E
Hotel There Destroyed at Midnight
last Night
MANY OTHER NARROW ESCAPES
Old Wooden Building Burned So Rap
idly That Guests Up Stairs
Were Cut Off.
Timothy Burns, a veteran employo
of the Boston and Maine railroad in
Eagle Bridget; John Johnson, a Cam
bridge constable, and Frederick Sliep
ard, an employe of the Eagle Bridge
hotel, burned to death in a fire which
destroyed that hostelry shortly after
11 o'clock last night. Nine other
guests just barely managed to reach
the street in safety, but the three vic
tims are believed to have been trap
ped in their rooms on the third floor of
the structure. How the blaze started
or in fact what part of the building it
originated in, seems to be a mystery.
Residents of the village state that
when it was first discovered the build
ing was a mass of flames. Rumors
were afloat that others had been suf
focated or burned, but ultimately it
was found that all except Burns, Shop
ard and Johnson had escaped.
William Holsapple, the proprietor
of the hotel, which is located between
two branches of the Hoston and Maine
road, was awakened by snmke which
apparently originated In the rear of
the suildlnB. Ah effort was made at
once to arouse all of the guests, but
before the rooms occupied by the
tlnee victims could be reached the
flames drove every one from the
building. No sign of the men was
seen by the people attracted to the
scene of t tie blaze, and it is thought
that they did not awaken until It was
too late for them to grope their way
down the halls.
Residents of Eagle Bridge, ham
pered by the fact that there is no firo
lighting apparatus there, struggled to
keep the flames from communication
with nearby buildings, and a bucket
brigade worked until an L-arly hour
this morning. Efforts were made to
place ladders against the structure in
hope that some of the men could be
located, but the flames kept every one
at a safe distance. Finally the men
were forced to direct their attention
to the buildings located nearby, and
it was only after a hard fight that tho
flames were confined to the hotel,
which was destroyed.
Outside of the loss of life the prop
erty damage will amount to thousands
of dollars, as not an article of furni
ture could be saved, and those who
escaped from the building were forced
i to do so without even securing any
cf their wearing apparel or other per
sonal property. Neighbors took the
guests into their homes and did what
they could for them.
