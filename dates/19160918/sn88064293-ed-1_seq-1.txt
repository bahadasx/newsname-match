CHURCH NOTES
Rev. (
dav two
C. Wier delivered yester
instructive discourses. At
the morning service his subject was
Daniel and he held out the prophet,
us a type of manhood which is very .
our days. A striking point
rare
made by the speaker was that al
though Daniel was a prisoner in Bab
ylon among heathens and heathen
customs, he still retained his wor
ship for the true God and did not
defile himself with the king'« meat
and wine. :
At night Ruth was his subject j
and the central thought of his dis
course was that God's providence
was the pivot on which the story of
the Moabiters came to light God's
plan of universal salvation was in
the story of Ruth as a Gentile. By
marriage to Boaz, she became the
ancestress of our Savior, being the
great grandmother of King David.
Mrs Monroe at the morning ser-j
re rendered a faultless vocal .«<•- I
lection and Mr.
tt night.
Rev. McLane
Hirr.dl
of the
sol.
Presbyterian
[Church preached twice yesterday to
his flock. His morning subject was
the two sides of life, the bright on«
and the dark one. One of his points
was that people were always inclin
od to look on the dark side of life,
forgetting that every cloud has it'
silver lining
At night the lrtth chapter of Gem
.vas chosen by the teacher and
the visit of the three angels to Abra
ham was his theme. His main point
was that sometimes entertaining
strangers my bring blessings upo
