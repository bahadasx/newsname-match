VILLA ATTACKS
Country is in Turmoil Today
as Result of Raid by Ban

SALAZAR WAS RESCUED
Outlaws Are Being Pursued In Usual
Mexican Manner, by Carranza
Troops Far In the
Rear.
[By Webb Miller, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
EL PASO, Texas, Sept. 18.—All
northern Mexico is In turmoil today
as reports of Villa'B attack upon
Chihuahua City early Saturday spread
throughout the country. Four thou
sand defacto troops from Monterey
are being rushed to Chihuahua City
and other points, while two columns
of cavalry are pursuing the flying
bandits toward Santa Clara canyon,
according to reports given out by
General Gonrales, Carranza command
er at Juarex.
Despite reports given out by Car
ranza officials that Villa was badly
defeated, the effect of his attack fol
lowing his threat to shout "grito" in
the city of Chihuahua on indepen
dence day was to rouse the enthus
iasm of the people. In Juarez, troops
are patrolling every street In order
to prevent an outbreak of pro-Villa
feeling.
Three Carranza officials who de
serted when the biandit attack on
Chihuahua commended and rode
north to catch a train, arrived In El
Paso early today. According to their
story the VlflwrdB attaeketf-tJre ttrwn
In two columns, one marching straight
to the penitentiary without a shot
being fired upon them, the other
column driving the Carranzista sol
diers before them to the palace. When
it was seen that the penitentiary was
doomed to fall, Carranzista officers
ran through the corridors, shooting
political prisoners through the bars.
About twenty were killed In that
manner. Thou the doors were broken
down by the Villistas who rushed in
and rescued General Salazar.
General Trevlno, Carranzista com
mander, was shot by one of his own
men, these officers declare, and about
one-third.of the garrison mutinied
and went over to the bandit leader.
The VllllBtas lost about two hun
dred men, according to best esti
mates, while the Carranzista losses
were not announced, but were said to
be very heavy.
As the Villistas left the prison and
started to cut their way through the
government troops, hand to hand
fighting took place in the streets.
The streets were swept by Bhell fire,
killing defacto soldiers and bandits
alike. For an hour after Villa had
evacuated It, cannon fire was kept up
on the palace.
•The Carranzistas did not immedi
ately pursue when the bandits finally
cut their way through the lines. Once
outside the city, the Villistas re
formed and marched away in good
order across the Rio Churiscar, pro
ceeding northward toward Santa
Clara canyon.
By military men here, it 1b be
lieved Villa did not Intend to occupy
Chihuahua City, but that his purpose
was to make a demonstration for its
effect upon the American-Mexican

was so thick the craft could not be

this morning t.%:ree tugs signalled out

NEW YOtRiK, Sept. 18.—Millions of
dollars poured into this country by
warring European powers for muni
tions are to be poured back into
Europe at the end of the war by
American tourists and immigrants,
who will return to their home coun
tries to aid in the work of rehabilita
tion.
American curiosity to eee famous
battle fields and the desire of aliens
to Play a part in rebuilding the war
torn cities of their countrymen will
send money flooding back to Europe,
according to indications at steam
ship offices here today.
Taking as an estimate, as viewed
by steamship officials, that 100,000
Americans will visit Europe during
the firsj year after the war, and that
they will spend an average of $1,000
each, $100,000,000 will be returned to
the European countries within twelve
months after peace 1b restored.
Europe will, of oourse, be a greater
show place than ever, after the war,
steamship men point out, and con
sidering the wealthy Americans who
will visit the continent as well as
those of more moderate means, the
estimate of $1,000 each as the amount
they will spend, is regarded as low.
Inquiries and applications for pas
sage on the first ships to sail from
the United States to sail after the
war, are rolling intQ the booking of
fices toy the hundreds and causing
the steamship companies to make
every preparation to handle the 'big

But two companies—the North
German Uoyd and the Hamburg
American line—are actually accept
ing tentative bookings, in the face of
the uncertainty as to the termination
of the war. Hamburg-American line
officials refused to divulge the num
ber of passages already booked. These
bookings are being made in the order
of receipt and are subject to can
cellation.

lation," said Lindsay, "and it is too
early to give it great consideration."
