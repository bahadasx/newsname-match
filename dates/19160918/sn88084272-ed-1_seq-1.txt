OFFICES HIS
DEBTOFBOfi!
British Lieutenant Colonel,
Cashiered, Fights as Pri
vate; Reinstated.
London. En?. Sept. 18. A story of
how a man ' came back" is revealed to
all England in an official announcement
that Lieut. Col. John Ford Elkington
lias been reinstated to his rank and his
command. It is one of the strangest
romances of the world war.
Dismissed by court martial from the
army he had served for nearly 30 years.
just as his regiment was going into ac
twn in France in the clo-ing months of
1914, this English officer, disgraced at a
tune of life when the chances of fate
weighed heavilv against a man fighting
for suddenly lost honor, found refuge in
that queerest of all military organiza
tions, the foreign legion of France.
Friends Lost Track of Him.
Lost in the mazes of battlefields, a
mere legionnaire in the ranks, Lieut Col.
Elkington, late of the Royal Uarwick
shires, was all but forgotten. None of
his oM friends, bis old fellow officers,
none of the men who had seen him win
the queens medal lor ialor in Sooth
Africa; none of thoe knew that Elking
ton was out there "i-omewhere in
France," recklessly winning lu way
back.
King Approves Reinstatement
But now Ldkington is back in Eng
land. Pumed on his breast are two
of the coveted honors of France the
military medal and the military cross;
but most valued possession of all is a
bit of paper which wipes out the errors
of the pa-t a proclamation from the of
ficial London Gazette, announcing that
the king has gracHilv approved the re
instatement of John Ford Elkington in
the rank of lieutenant colonel, with his
previous seniority, in consequence of his
gallant conduct while serving in the
ranks of the foreign legion. Xot only
lias CoL Elkington been restored to the
army, but has been appointed in his old
regiment, the Royal Warwiekghires, ui
which his father fought before him.
His Error Not Disclosed.
In this same London Gazette, at the
end of October, 1914, bad appeared the
" wtouer, lan, naa appeareu me
crushing announcement that Elkington
eral court martial. What his error was
' did not appear at the time and has not
been alluded to in his returned hour of
honor It Mas a courtmartial at the
front at a tune when little time could
be wasted upon an incident of this sort
The charge, it now is stated, did not re
flect in an way upon the officer's cour
age. But with fallen fortunes he passed
quietlv out of the arm)- and enlisted in
the legion that corps where thousands
of brave but broken men have found a
shelter and now and then an opportunity
to make themselves whole again.
Fighting Days Are Over.
CoL Elkington did not pass un
scathed through fire. His fighting days
are ended His knnes an shattered and
