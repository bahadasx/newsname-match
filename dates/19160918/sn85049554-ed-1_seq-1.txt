Washington, Sept. IS.—Great Bri
tain's reply^o the American note pro
testing against the seizure and censor
ship of neutral mails is on Its way to
Washington,, and is understood to be
largely a repetition of the arguments of
the justification of the policy of the
allies contained In a memorandum re

The protests of the United States
made May 24, declared that "only a
radical change in the present British
and French policy, restoring to the
United St^teg. Its full riKhts as a neu
tral. power, will satisfy this govern
ment." 1
At the British embassy today it was
stated that the allies desired to lighten
the censorship as much as possible and
that it was'wtlh this in view, that the
series of conferences to be held in New
York this week, between American ex
porters and Sir Richard Crawford,
trade adviser of the embassy, has been
arranged.
Embassy officials denied reports from
Berlin that Great Britain had sus

cut off matt communication between
those countries and the outside world.

New York City, Sept. 18.—There will

to compel the traction heads to observe
their recent agreements with the rail

to him as the iast resort.
The mayor promised to make another

VILLA MITS
'i ATTAGKGfTIES
Make Assault on Guerrero
and Chihuahua City
and Are Repulsed.
AMERICAN CAVALRY
KNOWN TO BE NEAR
Not Believed That United Statea
Troops Came in Contaot With Out
law Army, Said to Number 1,000
Men at Time of Attack on Chihuahua
—Eighty-seven Prisonors Captured
and Put to Death by Carranxa Troopa
El Paso, Tex., Seipt. 18.—A small
band of Villistas made an attack on
Guerrero, eight miles west of Chihua
hua City, but were repulsed and fell
back across the line of the Mexico
Northwestern railroad toward the foot
hills of the continental divide, pillag
ing ranches as they went, according
to advices received here today.
Recent reports received h°re have
assrted that American cavalry scout
ing patrols have been operating be
tween Guerrero and Nnmiiulpa. The
patrols were sent south from B1 Valle,
the southernmost American base, in
response to reports that Villa him
self was leading the bandit band in
that vicinity.
Mexican authorities at Juarez said
wire communications were faulty and
no reports of an engagement at Guer
rero had been received.
It was not considered probable that
American patrols would encounter tlm
bandits, who probably were making
for sccret lairs in the hills of that dis
trict.
First Attacked Chihuahua City.
An earlier report of Villa's opera
tions said that Francisco Villa and
forces numbering upward of a thous
and men attacked Chihuahua City.
Mexico. The statement says Villa was
repulsed, losing 153 dead and 87 pris
oners, who were immediately executed.
The government casualties were not
stated.
Because of the simultaneous out
break of Villa's sympathizers in Chi
huahua City, the state capital was
placed under martial law and the de
cree was today extended to embrace
the state.
The battle, according to details made
public tonight by Gen. Gonzales, lasted
t&irte.pn hours. Villa had previously
glv?n warning he would attack on
Mexican Independence. Dayv ibut no
weight was attached to the declara
tion. At 4 o'clock in th* morning,
however, the capital was attacked
from three sides, the west, east and
north.
Liberate Convict*
The defending troops consisted of
about 2.000 men. The Villistas. swith a
rush Into town, gained possession of
the penitentiary and were aided by the
prisoners, whom they liberated an.1
partly equipped with arms. The gov
ernment trooos. rallyjner at the bar
racks. fshelled the penitentiary find
speedily caused its evacuation.
Other bands of Villistas. proceeding
according to a carefully prepared plan,
gained a foothold in the state palace
and the federal building. There the
hottest fltrhtfng took place, lasting for
hours. Machine guns and to some ex
tent field guns were used by the gov
ernment troops, and extensive pron
ertv damage resulted.
The rebels fouerht with the utmost
desperation. It was remarked hv eov
ernment officers that the Villistas
were Invariably tall, well conditioned
Mexicans, apparently the pick of the
Chihuahua and Durango mountain
men. Weight of numbers and nuin'
tlons fl^slly fumed the balance In
favor of the government.
Prisoners Put to Death.
The snrronndinsr of the buildings
was completed about noon, and late in
the afternoon the rrovernment trooos
came into hand to hand contact with
the rebels. R'oodv P^htlnp ensued. In
which th» remnant of the Villistas es
caped. tocother with the slightly
wounded. Those taken prisoners were
overpowered In the palace, their am
munition 0*banit»d. The wounded
wro expected where fher lav.
The prisoners were tak»n from the
n^nitentJnrv en'rlv Snnday morning
and executed.
Villa himself did tiot lend the nf
taolc, hut directed tbe mnvpmmi of his
men from the outskirts of the cltv.
