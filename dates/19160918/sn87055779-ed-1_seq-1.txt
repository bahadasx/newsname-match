Rooseveltian Data Said to be

Ntrs-Tlm Special Servbe:
NEW YORK, Sep.t 18. Religion
is to be injected into the political
campaign by the republican national
c ommittee as ithin the next week ac
cording to present plans through the
instrumentality of a moving picture
leased on a scenario written by Hal
Heid and produced by Mr. Reid as
sisted by Everett Colby, foi iner pro
gressive state, senator of New Jer
sey, and nnw an active member of
the republican national campaign
committee. Tho film will be turned
over to the republican national com
mittee by Mr. Ueid and if present
plans are not changed will be dis
tributed throughout the country by
the national committee, the picture
to te displayed under the auspices
of or by arrangement with the va
rious republican state committees.
In addition to bringing a religion
Issue Into the campaign, the picture
ot which Mr. Heid is very proud, and
which Mr. Colby averts is "aj
corker," constitutes an attack upon
the president of the United States,
unique in conception, and amazing
jn its development. One of the chief
scenes of this photoplay shows a
group of Catholic nuns lleeing in
terror from a band of Villistas he
fore a convent in Mexico. They art
overtaken, seized by the Mexican
bandits, and dragged into the under
growth screaming and protesting.
Ii low at the President.
Instantly there is flashed on the
f-ereen a picture showing Pres't
Wood row Wihon at his desk in
Washington, his head resting on his
;trm asleep. Tins is but one of the
t-o-called ''historical scenes" which
Keid'.s photoplay shows. There are
many others, the historical accuracy
of which might be questioned. It i.
In this scene, however, that the re
ligious question is brought promi
nently to the fore. though in a
subtle manner.
That this is not mere accident or
ase of over-zeal on the part of the
photcplaj v right, would seem to bo
clearly indicated by another cam
paign incident of the last week.
The Hughes' alliance, a subsidiary
to the republican national commit
tee, having otliees in the same build
ing as the committee at number Ml
I "if th av.. has as its honorary chair
man. Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.
MP's Alice Carpenter is the chair
man, and anions the women con
nected with the organization are
Mrs. William II. Cox. Miss Anne
Morgan. Mrs. F.lon II. Hooker. Mrs.
E. Tiffany Dyer .Mid Mrs. James H.
Reynolds. The "group chairman" is
Mrs. Noble McConnell.
Wrote AlH.nu "Atroeltles."
There has come into possession of
the New York World a circular let
ter sent out from the alliance head
quarters last Mondiy signed by Mrs.
McConnell. It is addressed "Dear
Madam" and reads in part "Do you
know what the election of Charles
Evans Hughes rxans to this coun
try? It means first of nil protec
tion to our people, particularly in
Mexico. .Stop to think a minute of
the horrors perpetrated there, while
Mr. Wilson does the watchful wait
ing act. the diplomatic letter act,
and all the other disgusting acts:
while we sit helpless and appalled
at the atrocities taking place there.
"And when you think of the out
rages committed in the convents, no
matter what your belief is. your
tlood roust run cold at the thought
of what those women whose lives
are dedicated to Almighty God. suf
fered and are suffering. On cannot
think of this phase of it without be
ing utterly disgusted with the pres
ent administration."
Just a few days before this letter
wa-s rent out, possibly when it was
tinff prepared, Keid and his band
tit "movie" actors, some of them
members of the national guard of
this state, were staging the hcrrors
that make the blood run cold." Mrs.
Hal Held taking the principle part.
Put the staging was not dor.- in
Mexico. It was done at Sheepshead
bay. New York. The residents of
the immediate locality were h'rri

Cniniwny Propiei Ilohl.
Heid is proud of his accomplish
ment. Nearly all the information ob
tained regarding the film was obtain
ed from Mr. Heid himself. Mr. Colby
acknowledged that lie had been aid
ing in the direction and approved
the parts of the film he had seen.
It was he who explained how the dis
tribution was to be accomplished
through the various republican state
organizations. In addition it is
learned that the Universal Film
Manufacturing corporation, because
of the picture, found it advisable to
dispense with the further services of
lie-id, and the executive sice presi
dent of the concern, Robert JI. Coch
rane, politely declined to witness the
lirst run of the film.
It is also learned that some of
Reid's friends when told of his new
photoplay, expressed themselves in
substance as follows
"I do not believe that I have ever
listened to anything that shows such
real rottenness in politics as this
ida of the republican national com
mittee. It is the most disgusting
thing I ever listened to. It consti
stitute a series of deliberate and
studied insults to the nation's chief
executive."
Tldnks It IWcrful Weapon.
"I call it 'watchful waiting.' " said
Heid at his new olfiee at 1600 Broad
way, when asked about the picture.
"I think it will po a long way toward
beating Mr. W端son. First I show
Villa peering through the hushes.
Then there is a sub-title reading
about this. 'Why didn't Pres't Wil
son stop the war in Europe by put
ting an embargo on all exports to
all European countries alike, except
cn food stuffs?' "
Keid was nsked whether this was
his own idea, or whether it had
originated with the republican na
tional committee, as it would ob
viously have been of great interest
to the business men of the country
had the latter been the case. Mr.
Reki acknowledged that the idea
was his own, and added. Mr. Wilson
could have stopped the war in a few
weeks if he had done that.
"I often lay awake at night and
think of the thousands who have
been killed and of the blood that
has Mowed simply because he would
not put his pen to stich a document,"
said Peid.
Ilaving thus indicated the posses
sion of an active imagination. Reid
went on telling of the scenario:
"Next I show Vera Cruz. A launch
filled with American sailors is ap
proaching the wharf. Close up. the
American in the boat is shown with
-iexicans armed, standing on the
wharf and they fire on the boat. I
show the officer in the boat picking
up the American Mat? riddled with
bullet holes."
Shown Asleep Many Times.
Reid explained that he played the
American consul himself and de
manded an apology from Huerta in
his photoplay. Huerta, played by
Wililam Cone of Flatbush. exclaims
dramatically:
"If your gringo president wants an
apolcgy. he ran come here and get
it," and then, said Retd wilh a
Pleased smile. l show the president
asleep at his desk. I show that all
through the picture, a dozen times
or more, the president is asleep. I
show it after the attack on Col urn -1
us and after Carizal. and after the
nuns are attacked."
But having gone a little ahead of
hl story. Heid returned to the Vera
Cruz incident.
"I next show," he said, "the fu
neral of the 17 men whr were killed
there. The funeral took place here,
you know. I show the funeral and
the president riding in a carriage,
and I follow that with this line:
'And he bad the efTronterv to attend
the funeral.' "
Keid went on to say that he had

WASHINGTON, Kept. 18. Spain,
once the mightiest power in trade
on the seven seas, is seeking to re
gain her international prestige and
is looking to the United. States for
aid. King Alfonso who, throughout
his rrdgn. has been known as an ad
mirer of American progressiveness,
has laid out a pretentious campaign
to take advantage of the opportuni
ties for expended trade the Euro

Prior to the war goods from Ger
many filled the Spanish market. The
Spanish people now are using Amer

better satisfied with them. King
Alfonso is planning to send trade
commissions to this country to study
American business methods.

Howe of Columbia, and sister of

pastor, Rev. A. W. Elackwood, a

ary, and three hymns by a quartet.
Only the immediate family and a
few close friends had seats reserv
ed. An offer by authorities of the
city for the closing of business
houses and draping of buildings in
black was thought by the president
to be not in character with the sim
plicity aimed at in his visit under
the circumstances and there was no
notice taken oilicially of the chief

Commercial Adviser Trying to
Find Method That Will
Satisfy American
Business Men.
GERMAN FIRMS WANT
CONTRACTS CARRIED OUT
Insist That Goods Made to
American Orders be Ac
cepted United States
Will Not Join Holland.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON, Sept. IS. The
International situation today loomed
up materially complicated. With
British interference with American
trade being strengthened all along
the line, pressure for retaliatory
measures by this government was
increasing. And, to add to the com
plications, comes the announcement
through Germ?n sources that manu
facturers there undoubtedly acting
under orders from the government
are demanding acceptance of goods
made to American orders under con
tract. In connection with the latter
proposition cable advices from Ucr
lin say that the agents of the Amer
ican firms in Germany whose liabil
ity runs well into the millions, have
made an appeal for relief to Ambas
sador Gerard, who is forwarding the
facts here for the benefit of the state
department and Pres't Wilson.
It finally has been decided by the
state department not to take any
action regarding the retaliatory
measures permitted under the re
cently adopted revenue act until the
full resources of diplomay are ex
hausted. The department is cooper
ating with the treasury and com
merce departments.
Takes I'p Question.
Within the hist few days Sec'y
Lansing has had the entire trad
question up again with Ambassador
Spring-Riee, while Counsellor Polk
has discussed it with the legal rep
resentatives of the British embassy,
Colville Rarclay.
As a result of these conferences
Sir Richard Crawford, special com
mercial adviser of the embassy here,
is endeavoring to work out a mail
system which will remove the ma
jority of the causes for the delay
which has so exasperated American
business men. He will confer in New
York with a leg.nl representative of
tfie American importing and export
ing hiuns during this week.
Will Offer Suggestions.
At these conferences he will sub
mit several suggestions for coopera
tion, the adoption of any of which,
oihcials of the embassy here say, will
make it possible for commercial mail
to be passed through the British
censor's orlice while a vessel is lying
detained in Kirkwall harbor, thus
allowing the mail to go right
through without being detained from
three weeks to two months as at
present. He also will endeavor to ail
just the troubles of the dealers in
foreign exchange so that cable de
lays which have cost American bank
ers thousands of dollars can be ob
viated. The state department still is await
ing complete details of the new
British restrictions on American
commerce with Holland and the
Scandinavian countries. I'ntill nil
the facts are available no action will
be taken by this government. It was
Intimated, however, that there would
be no "joint protest" no matter what
the facts may be. While this gov
ernment will gladly keep Holland ad
vised of its every move, the policy
settled upon is understood to be one
cf complete independence in inter
national affairs.
Who Will Entertain Centennial Visitors?
It is expected the .erreat Indiana centennial observance in
south Bend Oct. 3. 4 and 5 will attract to the city many thou
sands of visitors more than the hotels can accommodate with
sleeping quarters. Those in charge therefore request all per
sons who will receive visitors into their homes to immediately
send their names and addresses to centennial headquarters,

on both sides, but the general aspects
of the situation improved today
when Pres't T. V. O'Connor of the

This conference was sought by the
labor leaders and Mayor Mitehel was
kept in complete ignorance of its
purpose. Timothy Healy, president

Internat tonn 1 News Service:
CHIHUAIU'A. Mexico, Sept. 1 S.
Firing squads today continued their
execution of bandits who had been
roundel up in different sections of
the city following the battle that
occurred Saturday when Francisco
Villa attempted to capture this Car
ranza base. According to a state
ment riade at Gen. Trevino's head
quarters, more than 200 of the bri
gands have been executed. As
Villa suffered a loss of nearly 200 in
the battle that followed his attack
or- the city and Carranza officers as
sert that fully a third of the bandit
leaders command has been wiped
out.
Villa himself, with the remainder
of the beaten band is understood to
be in retreat toward the I'arral
region. Carranza cavalry' is in pur
suit, but there is little hope here
that "Pancho" will be captured.
Gen. Trevino. who was wounded
in the shoulder, remained- at his
post today. Shortly after midnight
he made a tour of inspyction
throughout the city and questioned
several of the prisoners who were
taken.
The Carranza authorities believe
that Villa was assisted by traitors
in the city or by followers who had
come in disguised as peons and
armed with weapons that were
smuggled through the Carranza
guards.
Hi: LPS C. HI LANZA.
International News Servi-e:
WASHINGTON, Sept. 1. That
Carranza has materially been
strengthened by the battle at Chi
huahur. City in which it is claimed
some f00 Villistas were killed, was
the opinion of officials of the war
and state departments today. They
said that the disaffected bandit gen
erals who recently have thrown
their lot with Villa had depended
on the capture of the city to reha
bilitate themselves. Had the move
ment been .successful, and Villa se
cured the hoped-for foothold in
the northern city hundreds of Car
ranzista soldiers and former fo'low
ers of both Villa and Orozco would
have rallied to his cause. The con
trary now is expected to be the cr.se.
Trevino's victory will greatly
strengthen Carranza in the discon
tented north, while it is expected
that the forces of the bandits will
disintegrate.
The official reports received here
from Consul Gen. Rodgers in Mex
ico City hear out the press dis
patches that Villa's attack failed
through the superior strategy of
Trevino. The assault was a sur
prise and tbe attacking forces were
able to :ret eentrol of the federal
and municipal palace and the pen
itentiary. However, in anticipation
of the attack. Trevino had massed
his men and guns at strategic points
and as soon as he was able to as
sume personal command the bandits
were driven out with heavy losses.
