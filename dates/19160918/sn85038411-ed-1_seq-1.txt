Von Mackensen Continues to
Force Rumanians and Rus
sians Back
The new thrust by the French
south of the river Somme in north
France, where the important railway
town of Chaulnes is their objective,
has resulted in the complete encircl
ing of the village of Deniecourt, the
Paris War Office announced to-day.
Deniecourt from the center of the
wedge the French are driving into
the German lines north of Chaulnes,
Its resistance holding up their ad
vance between Berny and Verman
dovillers, complete occupation of
which villages by the French was
announced last night.
Further progress has been made
by the French in this region and
heavy counterattacks by the Germans
on the new French positions both
north and south of the Somme have
been repulsed according to to-day's
report, which announces that the
Germans sustained enormous losses,
two battalions being nearly wiped
out. The French have taken 1200
prisoners and ten machine guns.
British Moving Ahead
The British are keeping up their
forward push north of the Somme,
scoring their advances, however, at
isolated points, apparently in opera
tions to straighten their line and se
cure their hold on captured ground.
London to-day reports an appreci
able advance on the left flank where
the British line has been driven fur
ther toward Le Sars, along the
Pozieres-Bapaume road north of Mar
tinpuich and east of Courcelette.
On the Macedonian front an en
tente attack in the Struma valley
northeast of Saloniki was repulsed
by the Bulgarians, the Sofia War Of
fice announces, a counterattack forc
ing the entente troops back to the
west bank of the river.
Von Mackensen Progresses
The forces under Field Marshal Von
Mackensen are continuing to pro
gress in their campaign in the Ru
manian province of Dobrudja, Sofia
reports. Some indication of stronger
resistance by the Rumanians and
Russians, however, is furnished by
the official statement which reports
heavy counterattacks.
The presence or a division of Ser
bian troops in Rumania, alluded to In
recent press dispatches, has not been
officially accounted for. The proba
bilities are that some Serbian troops
were forced into Rumanian territory
during the Teutonic drive through
Serbia last Fall, being interned there
and liberated for service with the en
tente forces when Rumania entered
the war or else the division is com-

across the line of the Mex. N'western

ranches as they went, according to prl- j
vate advices here to-day.
Recent reports received here have as- '
serted that American cavalry scouting
patrols have been operating between

The patrols were sent south from

ment at Guerrero had been received.

DELUGE OF NAMES
POURING IN FOR
PROPOSED HOTEL
Suggestions Come From Many
Cities and Towns Outside
Harrisburg
MANY PRAISE BOOSTERS
Writer Offer "Harrisbourne"
"The Monumental," Federal,"
and Other Names
Histories, dictionaries, books of
synonyms, and the fertile minds of
many citizens have been brought into
action in the search for a suitable
name for Greater Harrisburg's new
hotel-to-be.
Beside the "Penn-Harris," the "Sus
quehanna," apd all the others, "The
Pennsylvania," "The Harrisbourne"
(E. H. Gottschall), "The Monu
mental" (J. H. Park), "The Capitol
Park Hotel" (M. S. Kelliy), "The
Greater" (E. J. Kreidler), have taken
their places as possibilities. A young
lady who modestly requests that her
name be withheld believes that "The
Federal Square" might meet the bill.
Mr. Kreidler supports his choice of
"The Greater" with the statement that
Harrisburg has been growing exten
sively for years and is growing greater
every day.
B. F. Brady, who inclines some
what to history, suggests anyone of a
dozen names, including the Lincoln
House, Garfield House, McKinley
House, Washington House, Republican
House, and Charleston House, while
Mrs. Cameron L. Baer advocates the
contraction of the two streets on
I which the hotel will be located into
"The Thirwald."
Compliment From Minister
There is widespread interest
throughout the city and Central
Pennsylvania in the selection of a
name. Responsive to the invitation
of the Telegraph to submit names have
already done so and to-day we print

28 Americans on Board
British Ship Sunk by
U-Boat Without Warning
New York. Sept. IS. A torpedo
sank the British steamship Kelvinia,
carrying 28 Americans, according to
G. W. Dillard, of Richmond, Va„ one
of the Americans, who arrived here
to-day on the Cunard liner Tuscania.
Agents of the Department of State
met the Tuscania upon her arrival
here and took the depositions of the
Americans.
According to Dillard the Kelvinia
was torpedoed at 2 o'clock in the
morning without any warning having
been given. The vessel listed im
mediately and as there was not enough
boats for both the crew and the Am
ericans, who were engaged as hostlers
for the cargo of horses, many of the
Americans put on life belts and jump
ed overboard. They were rescued by
a trawler after floating about for 14
hours. Dillard said that at the time
the Kelvinia met with the mishap he
saw nearby a light which later seemed
to disappear under the water. This,
he declared, confirmed his belief that'
there had been a submarine attack.
National Guard Units
to Be Returned Home as
New Regiments Arrive
Washington. Sept. 18. General
Funston was directed by the War De
partment to-day to return one Na
tional Guard regiment to its home sta
tion for each new regiment of the
guard sent to the border.
The second New York infantry will
be one of the first to return. Other
regiments will be selected by General
Funston. Train equipment used to
transport troops recently ordered south
will be employed in bringing home the
returning regiments.
The order was issued in line with
Secretary Baker's policy of sending all
organizations in State mobilization
camps to the border before they are
mustered out of the federal service.
It was Indicated at the War De
partment that no general movement of
guardsmen homeward would be
ordered until a decision affecting the
border situation had been reached by
the American-Mexican commission
now meeting at New London, Conn.
The department has submitted the
final disposition of all border troops,
1 National Guard and regulars, to the
| commission. When National Guard
i organizations are ordered to home
stations for mustering out, those mem
; bers who apply may be discharged at.
! border stations when applications are
I made in good faith and are approved
i by the commanding officers.

Taken by Clever Bunco
Men; Mexican Trip Over
Mike Krasnosefsky, of 1120 Chris
tiana street, with his family, was to
have gone to Mexico to-day. At the
eleventh hour the trip was called off.
There is one big reason. Mike had
the money at 8 o'clock this morning;
one hour later, two bunco men had
the cash—and were missing.
On his way through Capitol Park,
two strangers met Mike and asked
the direction to the post office, offer
ing $5 for the information. The
strangers flashed a roll of money.
One of them reached in the coat
pocket, pulled out Krasnosefsky's
money, intending to place the $5 hill

tim reached for his money, he was
handed back a package. On arrival
home, he found strips of newspapers
in the handkerchief.

Walks 20 Miles to Serve
Term in Northumberland Jail
Sunbury, Pa., Sept. 18. Frank
Zerbe, 32 years old, arrived at the
Northumberland county jail here
footsore and weary. He had a com
mitment sending himself to jail for
ninety days. Justice Shoener, of
Treverton, was the committing magis
trate. Zerbe was naled before the
; Justice on a charge of assault and bat
tery preferred by his daughter. He
] admitted his guilt and the court after
j a scatchlng rebuke sentenced him to'
ninety days.
"You might as well make It 190,"
' growled the defendant. "I'll take you
| at your word said the Squire, "you can
have 190 days and get ready to leave
i at once."
Realizing that Justice Schoener
meant business Zerbe appealed upon
him to take off the additional 100
days. The Squire replied: "I'll tell
you what I'll do. Here is your com
mitment to the county jail at Sunbury.
If you'll take it there yourself and
save your taxpayers the constable's
expenses I will knock off the additional
days."
Zerbe accepted the Justice's offer,
rolled up his trousers and walked the
twenty miles over the mountains,
nearly surprising the warden out of a
year's growth when he presented tala
own commitment.
