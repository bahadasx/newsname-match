Chicago, Sept. IS. Confession has
been made by two members of the al
leged syndicate of blackmailers, eight
of whom are under arrest here, that
operations of the swindlers has netted
them $1,000,000 within the last year,
federal officials announced today.
The confessions, it was declared,
disclosed that tho alleged band num
bers at least GO a third of whom arc
said to be women young, pretty and
crafty. A dispute over the division of
spoils, it was said, led to the confes
sions. Arrest of a score or more
members of the syndicate are cxpect-
f1 irlllnn o ii-nnlr
Tho men who confessed ,nre "Dick"
Barrett and Edward J. Thompson, ac
cording to Hinton G. Clabaugh, head
of the Chicago bureau of the federal
department of justice. Both are at
liberty, he said. They will become
witnesses for the government, how
ever, when the eight members of the
alleged syndicate, arrested in a raid
on a fashionable aparLment hotel Sat
urday night, are brought to trial.
Fear that they would receive long
prison sentences caused Thompson
and Barrett to confess, Clabaugh said.
He declined to say, however, when
they gave him the confession that led
to the raid.
Bail, aggregating $100,000, has been
fixed for tho eight members of the al
leged band now under arrest. They
arc to be given a hearing tomorrow.
Those under arrest and the bail they
will be required to give are:
Edward Donahue, alias "Doc" Don
ahue, $25,000.
Mrs. Helen Evers, alias Mrs. George
TV. Brown, $25,000.
Henry Russell, alias H. J. Russell,
$25,000.
Mrs. Edward Donahue, $5,000.
James Christian, alias James Rob
erts, $5,000.
George Bland, alias Joseph Pearl,
$5,000.
Mrs. Frances Allen, alias Mrs. Fran
cis Chapman, $5,000. r
The operations of the band are de
clared to have extended from coast to
coast- Men and women alike have
been victims. Persons of wealth
were tho objects in every case. Five
wealthy and socially prominent mem
bers of Chicago's socloty are declared
to have been blackmailed out of $20,
000. Their names were withheld.
Further arrests were expected today
In connection with the so-called black
mail syndicate, which raids by United
States department of justice officials
V
here Saturday night exposed. A wom
an member of the "syndicate" was bet
lieved in SL Louis," and the Los An
geles authorities were asked to locate
the sender of a telegram, addressed to
Helen Evers, one of the women ar
rested here, which read:
"Simon says thumbs up. Two men
are holding me. Watch the fire es
cape." Operations of the syndicate which
I now appears to have been of interna
tional proportions, were not confined
to the blackmail of wealthy men and
women, according to information de
veloped today. Among the effects in
the office of "Doc" Edward Donahue,
one of the men caught in the Satur
day night raid, was stationery of the
"United Turf Exchange" with "head
quarters in New York and offices all
over the world." There nvere also
cipher codes for deciphering messages
j received by wire, tolling what horses
to bet on, how much to bet, what
races and positions to play.
Fake newspaper clippings detailing
the wonderful cleanups made by a
young eastern plunger In pool rooms
apparently had been used to lure vic
tims. One letter found in Donahue's
room at the fashionable south side ap
partment house was from the "Horse
man's Association" of 146S Market
street, Louisville, Ky., signed by J. C.
Saulsberry, secretary, and addressed
to A. T. Kargor. The secretary said
he was sorry to hear of "Mr. Karger's
notoriety later and hoped he wouldn't
have nnother occurrence like that
again."
It seemed that Mr. Karger's picture
had appeared in a newspaper in con
nection with bookmaking activities at
the races.
UH1(, LU UU'U1 IU1GMU JUOHV.U
officials here today, the "United Turf
Exchange" must have been an exclu
sive affair. The rules stated that
members using the club rooms in the
evening must appear in full dress.
Evidently the "Horseman's Associa
tion" was known in Louisville as a
grain brokerage1 house. Code books
showed how wagers on horse races
could bo placed, nnd thero was appar.
ently no limit. If the bettor wanted
to place $50 on a horse he would or
der 50 boxes of red, white and blue
matches, tho color depending on tho
position to bet on the horse, viz.:
red, straight; blue, place; white,
show. Condition of track was de
scribed as follows:
"Dry, oats; muddy, corn; medium,
rye." If all these elaborate systems
were not enough to beguile the vic
tim, the fake newspaper clipping was
flashed. Tho headli nes of this article
states that a "young eastern plunger
cleaned up $80,000 from Seattle,
Wash.," pool rooms. Identity of man
not known to local gambling fratern
ity. The story then went on that all
efforts to get information from him
had been fruitless. He had never lost
a bet.
Here it was, according to tho de
partment of justice officials hero to
day, that Donahue broke into the
game. He would claim to.be the mys
terious stranger from the east.
According to the federal officials to
day, here are some of the things done
by tho syndicate:
They fleeced a multi-millionaire of
Now York out of $40,000 by threaten
ing him with arrest for alleged viola
tions of the Mann act, two of the
members of the syndicate imperson
ating secret service agents for that
purpose. They frightened a wealthy
Philadelphia woman who had been
too friendly with a stranger in a cafe
into giving them $35,000. They took
$10,000 from each of five Chicagoans,
.two of whom, .are women. They
brought about their own arrest, it is
alleged, by taking $3,500 from Mrs.
Regina Clipper of Philadelphia, and
afterward kidnaping her.
It was said today that the organiza
I tlon had worked as a whole since tho
first of the year and It is" believed to
I have cleaned up In that time $1,000,-,
000. The government officials say
j that for one known victim of the syn
i dicate, there are probably 20 un
known. J The eight victims of the syndicate,
so-called, were still in custody today, :
! awaiting their prillminary hearing be-
fore the United States commissioner I
tomorrow. It was said the alleged ,
head of the organization would be ar
rested during today.
Sendor of Telegrams Is Sought.
Los Angeles, Calif., Sept. 18. De
partment of justice officials here said
today they had received no informa
tion concerning a telegram sent from
here to Helen Evers, one of eight al
leged members of a so-called black
mail syndicate under arrest In Chica
go, in which sho was warned to
"watch the fire escapo." Federal au
thorities in Chicago had asserted the
sender was being sought in Los An
geles. E. M. Blanford, special agent of tho
department here, said he had no offi
cial knowledge of the case.
