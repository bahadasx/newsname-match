Secretary 3IcAdoo Will Be in
Topeka This Evening.
Representatives of 300,000 Kansas
farmers, already banded together In
co-operative societies needed for the
exploitation of farm loan banks, plead
ed today with the national farm loan
hoard for the location of a farm loan
bank in the capital city of Kansas.
It was a Hories of clinching arguments
presented to the board this morning
in the t'nited States court room in the
federal building by Maurice McAuliffe,
president of the Farmers' Union; A. P.
Reardon. president of the Kansas
Grange association: Alfred, Docking,
lecturer tor the Kansas Grange; E. C.
Johnson of the extension department
of the State Agricultural i-ollege and
Charles Dillon, managing editor of the
Capper farm papers.
The board announced that the de
sires of the farmers, the atmosphere
surrounding the cities and the railroad
facilities of the cities would be the
chief factors in deciding upon a lo
cation. Topeka gave them proof of
possession of these three factors in
huge hunks, 1 ;
Kansas City Hearing.
The meeting opened promptly at 10
o'clock. A bunch of representatives
from the Kansas side of Kansas City.
Mo., appeared to present that town's
claims. They were heard at 2 o'clock
this afternoon and following their
hearing the Topeka hearing was re
sumed. George W. Norris, United
States farm loan commissioner, ex
plained the workings of the new bill
in detail and then announced that as
much testimony as desired could be
presented.
Wichita, fix, Too.
It was rumored that Wichita is go
ing to put her fingers in the pie and
will appear at the Hutchinson meet
ing. Members of the board know noth
ing of such a plan but expressed a
willingness to hear the arguments of
any city which desired to get the bank.
The court room was filled by 9 o'clock.
To lick a as Center.
It was pointed out that Topeka is
the home of all big conventions of
farmers where the farmers cannot
only discuss the farm loan banks, but
may meet personally tne men in
charge of the big government institu
tion. It was shown that Topeka is the
center of Kansas and any 'district the
board may wish to choose in the mid
dle west.
"You take a map and a piece of
string and place a piece of chalk on
one end of the string and a pin on
the other," said Alfred Docking.
"Place the pin on Topeka and you will
find her in the center of any district
including Missouri, or Nebraska, or
Oklahoma or Colorado."
Further, it was pointed out that
through the medium of Topeka's farm
papers with a circulation larger than
those of any in the United States, the
location of a bank in Topeka will act
as a publicity, educational medium
for more than a million farmers in
Oklahoma. Missouri. Kansas and Colo
rado. This point was one of the most
strongly emphasized by all speakers.
The co-operation of the Kansas
farmers, centering in Topeka, legis
lative, social, industrial and educa
tional center of Kansas, was a fact
emphasized by each speaker. And
this, too, it was evidenced is a fact
being considered by the board.
Thirty Millions a Year.
"I believe." said Maurice McAuliffe.
"that if the bank is located in Topeka
it can do a business of thirty million
dollars within a year."
Mr. McAuliffe showed that the Kan
sas farmers already are co-operating,
have understood that art for years and
with Topeka and Kansas as a nucleus
for this district, the co-operation nec
essary will bring about the success of
the rural credits .bill in Kansas more
r-'.pidly than in any state in the middle
west. He told the board that the or
ganization which he heads represents
hi. 000 farm families in Kansas, di
vided into 450 co-operative organiza
tions existing in fifty-four counties in
the tate.
"AV understand the provisions of
th bill right now," said Mr. McAuliffe,
"and have discuss d it in every society.
In fact. I took such an interest in its
passage that I went before the com
mittee at Washington and discussed
the various measures of the bill. And
while it is not as good as I would like,
it is. gentlemen, certainly as good as
we can expect to stirt out with."
Agricultural Center.
' This. said Alfred Docking, "is tha
day of Joining. Kansas farmers hav?
been doing it for years. Topeka la
probaoly the greatest agricultural cen
ter in the United States and is the
favorite ?enter for th" annual meet
ings of the farmers. Take into con-

sideration, gentlemen, that Kansas is
strictly on agricultural state, one in
which there is little industrial life, and
the best state in the union in which
to launch and intensify the theory of
the rural credits bill. Topeka, as the
agricultural center, is the strategic
center for such an undertaking. My
one regret is that one of our big meet
ings is not in proprees and you cannot
have an opportunity to see the magni
tude of the farmer's organizations."
i Reardon Answers Questions.
A. P. Reardon, president of the
Farmers' grange, answered a series of
questions,
"Do you think of the class of big ten
ant farmers would build up their
farms better if they own their land?"
"Yes. sir. Thirty per cent of the
farmers own part of their land and
rent a nearby .acreage. They will ptxr
chase it as a result of the provisions
of the new bill."
"Has the rate prevailing on mort
gages in past years deterred purchase
of farms?"
"Yes, sir, it has."
"What is the average life of a mort
gage in this state?"
"From one to five years."
"Will tne long time mortgage pos
sible under this bill aid the farmers?"
"Yes, sir."
In addition to his other arguments,
Mr.McAuliffe stated that Kansas farm
ers are in a better position for han
dling the details of the farm loan bank
because a large per cent of them al
ready belong to farm loan associa
tions, and can use the new bill more
intelligently.
"Will land owners sell on the terms
provided in the rural credits bill?"
Mr. McAuliffe was asked.
"Yes, sir." he replied. "One reason
for this is the labor problem which Is
growing more complex each year and
the old farmers, like myself, will sell
rather than trust to the sort of labor
we are able to get. The young farm
ers are about the only people who will
work the land now and they wish to
purchase it here in Kansas if the
proper terms can be obtained on mort
gages." Railway Faei.'itles.
When it comes to railroad facilities
into Topeka there can't be any argu
ment against locating the bank here.
Following is a table prepared and sub
mitted to the board:
Mail Trains.
(Number of mail trains at Topeka,
54. Time for mail to reach Topeka
after 3 o'clock.)
St. Louis. 11 hours. 15 minutes.
St. Joseph, 3 hours.
Omaha. 11 hours.

Ardmore, Okla.. 17 hours.
Mufkogee. Okla., 12 hours.
Oklahoma City, 11 hours.
Wichita, Kan., 6 hours.
Hutchinson, Kan., 4 hours. 30 min
utes. In Any District.
Topeka doesn't give a great many
reps in what territory she is included.
She believes she is well situated for a
farm loan bank, no matter, what
states the district may include. A
ne:u petition prepared bv the To
peka Commercial club includes a
statement relative to the district and
uesires of Topeka in this line as well
as many other arguments for locating
the bank here.
I" tn Petition it says that in any
district that Kansas could be reason
ably placed. Topeka is the most cen
tral point for the location of a bank.
f or example, if the district should be
Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma. To
peka is situated almost midway of the
district. Mail from eastern Missouri,
s far as St. Louis, reaches Topeka in
eleven and one-half hours, from Ok
lahoma City :n ten hours.
If the district should be Nebraska,
Kansas and Oklahoma. Topeka would
still be the central point, lying mid
way between two adjoining states and
mail from Omaha or from western
points in Nebraska would reach To
peka in from eleven to fourteen hours.
If Colorado should be deemed a prop
er state to add to this district, Topeka
again is the ideal location for three
trunk line railways connect Topeka
with Colorado and can serve the
needs of that state as well as anv
other city in the district.
It is our opinion," read the peti
tion, "that the farm loan bank will
meet with its greatest success in states

WOMEN LURE RICH MEN
Got "White Slave" Evidence

Compel Woman to Hush Up
Scandal With $35,000.
Chicago, Sept. 18. Confession has
been made by two members of the al
leged syndicate of blackmailers, eight
of whom are under arrest here, that
operations of the swindlers have netted
them $1,000,000 within the last year,
federal officials announced today.
The confession, it was said, dis
closed that the alleged band numbers
sixty people, a third of them women.
A dispute over the division of spoils,
it was said, led to the confession. Ar
rests of a score or more members of
the syndicate are expected within a
week.
The men who confessed are "Dick"
Barrett and Edward J. Thompson, ac
cording to Hinton G. Clabaugh, head
of the Chicago bureau of the federal
department of justice. Both are at
liberty, he said. They will become
witnesses for the government, how
ever, when the eight members of the
alleged syndicate arrested in a raid on
a fashionable apartment hotel Satur
day night are brought to trial.
Fear that they would receive long
prison sentences caused Thompson
and Barrett to confess, clabaugh said
Bail, aggregating $100,000, has been
rixed for the eight members of the al
leged band now under arrest. They
are to be given a hearing tomorrow.
Those under arrest and the bail thev
will be required to give are

FLYERSINCHARGE
Twenty Airships Led French
Troops in Fierce Attack.
Panic Among the Germans
When Machines Were Seen.
Paris. Sept. 18. For the first time
in the history of the world, the
French used an aeroplane squadron to
lead the successful attack on the vil
lage of Bouchavesnes, north of the
Somme.
Twenty fast armored aeroplanes,
each mounting three machine guns,
one pointing forward and two down
ward, charged the German lines be
fore the French infantry left their
trenches.
Flying high above the charging air
column were French aviation offi
cers, who directed the attack below in
much the same manner that an officer
directs an infantry charge from ,a
sheltered dugout.
The French fliers swooped low over
the German lines as the artillery lifted
and raked the German trenches with a
murderous fire. Prisoners report that
this form of attack had a remarkable
effect upon the Germans who had sur
vived the artillerying and were await
ing in their half ruined trenches the
coming storms of French infantry. It
sent them flying in panic down com
municating trenches and in some in
stances, caused machine gun com
panies to desert their posts.
As the French infantry came on
with a rush, the air charges drove for
ward to the second phase of their
work. They flew along the roads,
turning their machine guns on German
reserves being brought into action
along the roads leading to Bouchaves
nes. This new use of aeroplanes proved
so successful that it is expected to play
a most important part in future oper
ations of the war.
British tliers apparently used the
same method successfully in the Brit-
' ish advance against the Germans Fri-Iday.

Carefully Instructed Children
Wept for Congregations.
His name is Osaba tishor'ano: h
has large, sad Syrian eyes and a.
tongue that could wile any known
variety of bird off any known species
of shrubbery. He speak several lan
guages. .- y .
He is also a Sweedish ' preacher of
the Swedish Bethel denomination. At
least he was when he spoke before the
Rev. A. Liljengren's congregation last
June for the collection.
However, when he met the Rev.
A. J. Ross his faith had changed to
that of the German Methodist. He
told the sorrow of Armenia to the
congregation there with tears in eyes
and voice and collected. The Rev.
Ross gave him money and offered him
a light suit for the summer weather.
He accepted the first but declined the
latter, saying that charity stirred
more easily when he was attired in his
clericals. The Rev. Ross became sus
picious and Otisho left town.
He left his wife and three children
who then had their innings. The next
Sunday morning Airs. Otisho appeared
before Grace cathedral and told the
incoming congregation a tale of woe
and desertion. And her carefully in
structed family wept. Many of the
congregation responded in cash.
Canon Geisel, who has had long ex
perience with the wily Syrians in New
York settlement work was on th
scene. He listened 10 the tale of woe
and indicentally hW ear caught the
mother's hurried whisper in German
to her 7-year-old daughter "not to tell
the man anything."
Pending investigation the Provident
association agreed to pay her rent
which they have done for the greater
part of the summer.
Toured Others Parts.
This morning a flood of letters ar
rived telling of Otisho's operations in
other parts. He has successfully tour
ed the. small country churches in
Oklahoma, North Dakota, Missouri
and New York.
Charity never stepped more quickly
than to the relie of the unfortunate
Syrian minister of the Methodist, Bap
list, Swedish Bethel and a host of
other denominational affiliations, all
depending upon the locality. In each
state he left his wife and family. In
South Dakota the information that he
was sending substantial drafts to a
New York Syrian bank caused his hur
ried departure. And the "deserted
wife plea" availed his wife nothing for
they traced him by telegram and made
him come and get her by threats of
prosecution.
It is known that he visited his wife
here in her charity-paid room two
weeks ago and it is believed that he is
now in Kansas. If anyone knows of
his whereabouts he would delight the
Provident association by sharing the
information.
They have a little bill for groceries
and rent against him.
'The family is a real Syrian family,"
Rev. Geisel said today. In my New
York settlement we found case after
case where the Syrian families were
accepting charity with one hand and
making bank deposits with the other.
Then they would go back to the old
country and live like princes among
the peasants for the rest of their days.
They are the most accomplished beg
gars in the world. They are artists In

HELP T0W0RTHY
Explanation of Rural Credits by
i Chas. E. Lobdell.
Farm Loans "Won't Make the
Shiftless Man Prosperous.
HOME OWNER AND BUILDER
Outside Funds Into Community
for Farm Betterment.
Rural Proprietorship Will Be
Easier as a Result.
Charles E. Lobdell, of Great Bend,
Kan., member of the federal farm
board, here today, says that the new
rural credits legislation will not make
the shiftless man prosperous, but will
enable the worthy farmer to solve the
problem of credit and thus make farm
owning -easier. - farm prosperity -mo re
certain, and farm life . more comfort
able. Charles E. Ijobdell. of Great Bend,
member of Farm Loan Board.
Mr. Lobdell was a banker at Great
Bend, Kan., but has moved to Wash
ington with his family since his ap
pointment. He believes the effort of
the government in assembling capital
and loaning it to the farmer at a low
rate of interest will not injure the
country banker, but will help him by
adding to the prosperity of the rural
communities, and thus stimulating
bank deposits.
Eliminates Broker's Profit.
"There is nothing intricate or ob
struse in the rural credits law," said
Mr. Lobdell. "It is merely applying
to the farmer as nearly as may be ap
plied the mutual building and loan as
sociation plan which has built thou
sands of town homes all over the
country. The system, when fully
worked out, contemplates a country
wide mutual loan association, owned
entirely by borrowers, and operated
at actual cost with the element of the
bankers' profits entirely eliminated. It
is under government supervision and
so safeguarded as to afford an abso
lutely safe investment, and at the
same time give to the farm borrower
the reduction in rates of interest that
always goes with unquestioned se
curity. EquaUze Kales.
"The results should be to equalize
and stabilize farm loan rates with a
great tendency to reduction. As a
country banker I can see no reason to
complain of the measure. Anything
that brings outside funds into rural
communities for the betterment of its
farms and the development of its ag
riculture, means more and better
bank customers. It is essentially a
home owner's and a home builder's
proposition, as evidenced by the re
quirements that the borrower shall
actually occupy and operate the mort
gaged premises. It is not available
for speculative borrowing and this I
regard as on e of the soundest fea
tures of the law.
"The measure will not change hu
man nature, nor make the shiftless
man prosperous. If, as suggested be
fore. It operates to equalize and stabil
ize rates, reduces tenantry, makes
farm proprietorship easier, and on
the whole, farm life a little more cer
tain, cheerful and comfortable, it wiil
have justified its enactment."

Nearly 8,088 Topeka sehool children
sorrowfully evacuated the last line of

ing and, forced back relentlessly by
Father Time, took up their winter
quarters in Topeka's twenty-two
schools; And the "swimniin' hole,"
the long carefree sunny mornings,
baseball, renumerative vacation jobs
and the Big Free Fair, all faded into
the limbo of things never to return.
However, regret is a very short feat
ure of the opening day for many, in
cluding the six hundred tots who are
entering school for the first time and
the 450 who enter the high school.
The occasion is fraught with pleasure
able anticipation for these. The first
grade of today with its songs, games,
story-telling hours, and busy work, is
a glorified Kindergarten for the little
tots and the high school of today with
the athletic field beckoning, the thirty
and more departmental organizations,
the class parties, the musical features
and good times in general make the
prospect very exciting for the
"froshies."
The school buildings of the city
on which $20,000 has been spent dur
ing the past year present an entirely
different appearance than they did
last year. Every school house in the
city has been thoroly renovated and
repaired. The Lincoln school children
have a real change, for, pending the
completion of the new Lincoln school,
they will attend school in a former
boarding house just south of the
grounds.

Nearly 1,500 high school students

students of last year are attending
local high' schools which under the
Barnes law are now giving four years
accredited work, the enrollment of
the high school presents a slight In
crease over last year s attendance of
1,400.
.The enrollment of the grade schools
is expected to show an unusual in
crease this year. Altogether the force
of 260 school teachers of the city
