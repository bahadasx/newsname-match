SETS PRECEDENT FOR WAR
New Plan Expected to Play Im
portant Part in Future Oper
ations at Front.
PARIS, Sept. U.-For the first time In
the history of the world, the French
used an aeroplane squadron to lead the
successful attack on the village of
Bouchavesnes, north of the Somme, It
was learned today.
Twenty fast armored aeroplanes, each
mounting three machine guns, one point
ing forward and two downward, charged
the German lines before the Fronch In
fantry left their trenches.
Fl)lng high above this charging air
column weio French aviation officers
who directed the attack several hun
dred feet below in much the same map
ner that an officer directs an Infantry
charge from a sheltered dug-out.
The French fliers swooped low over
the German lines as the artillery fire
lifted and raked the Oerman trenches
with a murderous fire. Prisoners re
port that this form of attack had a
remarkable effect upon the Germans
who had survived the artlllerylng and
were awaiting In their half-ruined
trenches the coming storms of French
Infantry.
It sent them flying In panic down com
municating trenches and in some In
stances -caud HVhlye-gJn ciitwf U
desert their posts.
As the French infantry came on with
a rush, the air chargers drove forward
to the second phase of their work. They
riew along the roads, turning their ma
chine guns on German reserves being
brought Into action along the roads
leading to Bouchavesnes.
This new use of aeroplanes proved so
successful that It Is expected to Play
a most Important part In future opera
tions of the war. British filers, appar
ently, used the same method success
fully In the British advance against the
Germans Friday.

Bremen Now Due
Almost Any Hour
All New London on the Lookout
for Expected Sub
marine. NEW LONDON. Conn., Sept. U.-New
London was excited today both again
and yet expecting the German merchant
submarine Bremen to arrive at any time.
The tug T. A. Scott, Jr hired by the
Eastern Forwarding Company, put out
last night when reports were received of
a submersible being off Block island.
Tills, It Is understood, was one of the
American submarines maneuvering in
these waters, but employes of the tug
company said they believed the Bremen
was likely to appear at any time. No
allied warships are reported off New
London.
When the soggy, chill fog lifted from
the Thames early today It failed to re
veal the Bremen out beyond Eastern
point, as waa expected. At 2 a. m. a
vessel humming like a submarine was
heard headed toward the sound beyond
the point. Reporters thought they sight
ed a tug with her, but the humming
ceased, all lights were extinguished, and
the fog was so thick the craft-could not
be picked up again. ,
Soon after 7 this morning three tugs
stgnaledout from beyond the edge of
tho lifting mists. One had a tow. The
submarlno hunters thought thev were
surely ir trlnle convpy for the Bremen,
tout It developed that one had nothing
more than a string of barges and the
others were without tow.
The Scott Company tugi which spent
last night nervously watching for the
Bremen, waa one of tha three.

of the British line with great violence
last night, as If In preparation for a
counter-attack.
Forty thousand Germans have been
killed, wounded or captured since the
Anglo-French allies resumed tho offen
sive on the Somme with battering blows
that bent back the Teuton lines.
The fighting continued last night both
north and south of the river with (he
greatest fury. The Germans were still
clinging desperately to tho village of
Denlcourt, under heavy French attack,
and making counter attacks against
Berny and Vermandolllers, lost to the
French yesterday afternoon.
North of the river British artillery
checked one German counter attack
after another with storms of shrapnel,
and at the same time opened a bom
bardment of Grandcourt and Le Sara,
on the two highways leading to Bap
aume. Great (Effect in Berlin.
The allied successes have had a most
profound effect In Berlin, according to
Hague dispatches today. The Germans
had beep led to believe that the Somme
drive had been halted by the Inability
of the British to capture tho Flcrs
Courcellete line and to break through
the German defenses around Thiepval.
The German papers aro now preparing
the public for the early evacuation of
both Peronne and Combles, and' pointing
out that a retirement on a wide front
may become necessary for strategic
reasons.
The French shifted their attack south
of the Somme yesterday to warn the
Germans not to withdraw troops from
that sector to re-enforce the battered
lines north of the river. The assault
waa completely successful and deepened
the wedge In tho German line between
Peronne and Combles.
