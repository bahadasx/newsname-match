Justice (llcgerlch refused to award
support to Mr. Puffy.
The writer, Justice Olegeiich was
told, was Thomas V. Conroy, a. young
Wall Street broker associated with
Lea lllglnson & Co., and married.
The Justice was ulso told that Duffy
threatened to bring Injunction pro
ceedings against Conroy to stop him
from courting Mrs, Duffy.
Duffy did not tell tho cqiirt how
ho cainn upon tho letters, but soon
after Mrs. Duffy learned they wero
