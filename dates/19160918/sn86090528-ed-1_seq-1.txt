Ada Man Declares Hughes Fails to Pitch
Campaign on High Plane Expected
of Him
TRAVERSES COUNTRY
IN VAIN FOR ISSUE
Result in Maine Not Disquieting to Dem
ocrats; Peace and Plenty Please
People of America
That Mr. Hughes has heen a giwt
disappointment as a candidate was
the declaration of Judge Tom Mc
Keown, of Ada, in his address at u
Democratic meeting at the city hall
here Saturday afternoon. "The people
naturally expected a man of the char
acter ami calibre of ?,lr. Hughes to
pilch his campign upon a high
plane," said the speaker, "hut he he
rein Immediately with common crti
cirin and abuse and has kept it up.
IJ.e started out by finding fault with
the president for appointing 'worthy
Democrats,' regardless of the fact that
one of the last acts of President Tatt
was to take a vast army of Republican
office holders under the civM service
blanket, and then he began his tour of
the country in search of an issue, a
task in which he has signally failed. '
In concluding; his address, Judge Mc
Keown said," "When Woodrow Wilson
was elected the Republicans told usi
that the country was facing disaster
but their mournful prophecies have
come to naught. Today peace and
plenty abound throughout the land and
we may as Well sehd up a prayer thai
the man in the White (louse, whose
vl',c administration has made these
things possible, may be permitted to
continue to manage the affairs of the
nation."
Judge McKeown was introduced to
the audience by L. C. Hutson, chair
man of the Democratic County Cen
tral committee, and after a few intro
ductory remarks directed particularly
to the members of the committee, urg
ing them to see that a full vote is poll
ed in November, the speaker took in
in some detail the various charges
which the Republicans are making
against the Democratic administra
tion. R(?Terring to the result of the
recent election in Maine, he said: "In
spite of the fact that Maine is one of
the banner Republican states, they
polled a scant plurality of only 13,000
votes. We must remember that the
enforcement of the prohibition law
was an .issue in the Maine election.
It was charged that the Democrats had
failed to enforce the law and if this
was true they have no right to com
plain because the people repudiated
their action."
Alluding to Col. Roosevelt's criti
cism of the president's "weasel words"
In the negotiation with Germany,
Judge McKeown said, "it is hlstorv
that Germany was the first nation in
the world to recognize the independ
ence of the United States and has
been our firm friend all these yean.
When" friction with a life-long friend
arises it is better to write him a po
lite note than it is to go after bi n
with a shotgun. The submarine pre
sented a new issue in international
policy and the president dealt with it
firmly, fairly and in accordance with
the dictates of humanity. New inter
national law was required to meet new
conditions and the president estab-
i:,.i.,wi ti,o r-iiriit if American citizen:! I
iinm.i iiiv ... -
to travel wherever their business calls
them." ;
Referring to the direct election t-I
senators, the income tax law, the ru
ral 'credits act, the child labor law and
other measures brought about by the
Democratic party the speaker said,
"Here was opportunity for Mr. Hughes
to find an issue if he wanted one.
Would he repeal any of t'e legisla
lion?"
Reviewing the history of the Mexi
can revolution, Judge McKeown de
clared that President Wilson sees in
it the struggle of a dow ii-yodden pe
file to better their condition. He sees
the peon struggling for liberty and he
is unwilling to trample upon Mexico
fimply because we are strong anl
Jnive the power to do so. If we want
the lands of northern Mexico let
buy thrm."
On tin eight-hour law leglslatlo
the speaker said President Wilson was
rei.dy to meet the issue. "He is ent
tied to credit for averting whut winil
have been the greatest business disu
tor in the history of 'he nation and on
this issue we can well afford to go be
j fore the people."
Speaking of the duty of the citizen
to go to the polls, Judge MclCeow
said, "Of course I want you to vote
the Democratic ticket hut I have mor
respect for the man who goes to the
polls and votes against my party than
I have for the man of my party who
fails to vote. The right to suffrage
was won at Ip. groat sacrifice and no
man should fail to do his duty on elej
tion day."

SAMMY LENIENT WITH
UNDIMMED LIGHTS
I'p to date no arrests have been
made on the charge of failing to pro
vide and use dimmers on automobiles
but Sammy Dwyer is preparing to
ome down on these offenders in the
near future. Dozens of automobile
owners have been warned of their neg
lect since the law went into effect, on
Friday but the traffic officer has been
lenient and is willing to. give every
body a fair show. But the time limit
is about up.
Sunday afternoon a party of four
were cautioned against speeding on
'hickasha avenue. They repeated the.
offense a few minutes later when
Sammy followed them up with ins
speedometer which showed that for
quite a distance they had maintained
a speed in excess of twenty miies an
hour within the city limits. The quar
tet stoutly denied this and although
they had no speedometer they declar
ed that they would all testify in court
today that Sammy had misjudged
them. Their threats were unavailing,
however.
