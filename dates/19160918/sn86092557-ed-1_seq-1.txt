Committee on Resolutions i
State Prohibition Coi
Report At
Yesterday afternoon's meeting at
the M. P. Temple to consider the bootlegging
situation In Fairmont and lay
the foundation for a movement which,
it is hoped, will wipe out violations
of the prohibition law, drew one of the
largest and most representative audiences
that has gathered to consider a
public question in this city In years.
Men and women prominent In all
walks of life and from all sections;
city and county officials, ministers of
practically all the Protestant churches,
Sunday school superintendents, Bible
class leaders, women prominent In
club and social life, were present and
all were Intensely In earnest.
The feature of the meeting was the
first hand testimony of women and
men that bootlegging and Its attendant
evils have flourished to an alarming
extent during the past four
months. The actual work done consisted
of the selection of two committees,
one consisting of J. M. Black, Dr.
J. A. Jamison, gnd J. A. Swlger, to
draw up resolutions to be presented at
another meeting which will be held
next Sunday afternoon at the same
place; the other, consisting of Rev.
Mr. Meredith, Rev. Mr. Eddy and J. L.
Leech, to communicate with State Prohibition
Commissioner Fred O. Blue
and bet his assistance In the enforcement
of the Yost law in this section.
The stories told by eye-witnesses to
liquor selling were , news to most of
those present and tbey produced a perceptible
sensation, but the one big
thrill of the meeting was an address by
Rev. M. O. Hayllng, the talented young
pastor of the colored Methodist
church, who made an impassioned plea
for the people of his race who, he said,
are being enslaved anew, this time by
vice, with the full knowledge of the
city and county officials and the connivance
of white men. The picture presented
by Mr. Hayllng was startling.
He said that conditions are worse now
than they were when there were sa
loons. The boys and girls could not
get liquor until they were of age while
now even children can get it and sex
makeB no difference. Colored mothers
of the city have bleeding hearts
because their daughters are being led
Into vice and their sons Into drunkenness
through the open traffic in liquor
and the dives which are maintained
without any attempt to conceal them
from the police and the peace officers
of the county.
Mayor Bowen and County Prosecutor
Haggerty were both present at the
meeting. The Mayor who sat In a seat
in the rear of the auditorium spoke
from that place during the meeting, declining
the Invitation to go to the platform
where the others had stood. He
admitted that be knew whiskey is being
sold in the city and said that be
had done all he could to stop It; had
put an extra light on Jackson street
and assigned extra policemen to that
district. He protested against the criticism
of his failure to suppress the
traffic and said that any one of his
critics after three months In his place
would see the matter In a different
light than they do now. He admitted
that he did not hope to be able to stop
bootlegging as long as there are men
who are willing to buy liquor.
Mr. Haggerty, on the other hand, assumed
a bold front and said that he
has been doing his duty. He read
some statistics showing the number of
arrests and the outcome of the cases
as compared with the record left by
his predecessor In office. He disclaimed
any intention to criticise the
Yost law but he nevertheless blamed
il aua idb iuwb in general ror me raci
that so many men peddle whiskey
without being molested and slip
through the fingers of the administration
of Justice when they do happen to
be arrested. Finally he made a grand
stand play by Inviting all good citizens
who are Interested In the enforcement
of law to come to his assistance by furnishing
evidence against the bootleggers.
He promised to reimburse them
for their outlay In buying the evidence
and pay them $2.50 per day for the
time they put In. Mr. Haggerty came
to the meeting feeling that whatever
was said or done would reflect pretty
seriously upon his official conduct and
he was armed with a pocket full of
notes which he Intended to use In his
defense. He prudently waited until
he saw what the meeting was going to
do before he made any move and did
not speak until the gathering was preparing
to adjourn. It Is altogether possible
that his offer to accept and act
unnn . ?1.1 nni.- nMnMiJ K? ? "I ?- - ? '- I
wiuwmwq |iiwfiucu uy yIHOIB ui*
izens will be accepted by some of
them. At all events the bootlegger
who plies his trade, in the open from
now on will do it at his own peril. The
meeting began promptly on the
hour set, 3 o'clock. It was opened
by Rev. J. C. Qyoomfleld, pastor of the
Temple, who announced briefly that
the presiding officer would be Rev. J.
B. Workman, pastor of the Diamond
street Methodist Episcopal church,
who would act in his capacity aa president
