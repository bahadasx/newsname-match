Republican Chairman Gives
Figures That Party Will
Carry the Senate.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 18?ClinJr
nmn William It. Wlllcox of tho lle
pulillcnn national committee, In n
statement issued last night express
ing the belief lhut Charlns fc. Hughes
will be elect oil wllliotit a ilouht, also
asserts that the election of a Repub
lican House of Representatives l? a
foregone conclusion. Then. Mr. Witl
cox says, "A 100 por cent cam pa I Kit
will bo conducted which InHuron a
Itopubllcun Ronato."
Chairman Wlllcox lines not content
himself with the making of more as
sertions of victory, hut ho (riven am
ple reasons for his faith. Ills state
ment follows:
The Senate Is now composed of
flfty-Hlx Democrats and Ihlrty-nlne
Republicans. Counting tho Maine
results, its composition becomes flfty
flvo Democrats and forty-one Repub
licans. In the November election
thirty-two senators are to he elected
to 1111 tho places of seventeen Demo
crats and fifteen Republicans.
Republicans Need Twenty-three.
To gain control or tho Senate tho
Republican must elect twenty-three
candidates?that Is, elect all of
their fifteen and make an Inroad or
eight on the Democrats. The states
new represented hy tho Republicans
are New Mexico. Minnesota, Wyo
ming. Delaware. Wisconsin, Rhode
Island. Massachusetts, North Dakota,
Connecticut. Pennsylvania, Vermont,
Washington. Utah. Michigan and
California. In none of these states la
there any doubt of tho success of the
Hughes and Fairbanks ticket.
As to tho senatorshlps mily. twu
may be considered doubtful?Wash
ington and Wyoming?and in these
tho undoubted strength of the na
tional ticket will servo to elect the
Republican senatorial candidates.
The stntcs represented by Demo
crats are Arizona. Florida, West Vir
ginia, Texas, Nebraska, Indiana (2),
Tennessee, Maryland, New Jersey,
Montana, Now York, Nevada, Ohio,
Missouri. Virginia and Mississippi.
Out of those seventeen placos the
Republicans must take eight. Can
they do it? Thoy can and will.
? First lot us eliminate the four cor
taln Democratic slates or Florida.
Texas, Virginia and Mississippi. This
limits the field to the twelve states
or Arizona, West Virginia, Nebraska,
Indiana 12), Tonnesse, Araryland,
New Jersey, Montana, New York,
Nevada and Missouri. Or those,
Ohio, New York, New Jorsey, nebras
ka and West Virginia, lr tho same
percentage or Progressives vote the
Republican ticket aB did Maine, will
elect Republican senators. Tho com
bined Republican majority In Ohio in
1912 was 74,000; In New York. 190,
New Jersey, 5G.000; Nebraska,
17,000; West Virginia, 22,000.
Borne Closer Miotics.
It we elect th6se Ave senators,
wlich Is practically certain, wo still
/ST6 ni BtatCB ?' Arizona, Indana
la), Tennessee, Maryland, Montana,
Nevada and Missouri rumlshlng eight
Places In which to got the remaining
three required, and In each one of
theme there Is a good fighting chance
ror Republican success. In Arizona
the Democratic vote In 1912 exceeded
tho combined Repubtlcan voto by
385; In Indiana tho combined Ilepub
'lc,? ,?'e? exceeded tho Wilson vote
by ,).,000; in Tennessee the Wil
son vote exceeded tho combined Re
publican vote by 18,000; in Maryland
tho combined Republican voto ex
ceeded the Wilson vote by 13,000;
In Nevada the combined Republican
400? excccdecl tho Wilson vote by 1,
Thus, in these seven states, fur
nishing eight senatorial places, the
combined Republican vote exceeded
the Wilson vote In five, and the Wil
flon vote exceedod the combined Re
publican in two.
Summarized, to elect the required
twenty-three senators the Republi
cans have fifteen reasonably certain
Republican senatorshlps with which
to start; Ave senatorshlps to get In
states represented by Democrats, In
each of which there Is a big majority
of combined Republicans and Pro
gressive votes; and three to get from
the eight places in seven states, in
five of which there Is a small major
ity of combined Republicans and Pro
gressives, and In two of which there
was a small Wilson majority.
The Republicans lost some sena
torshlps In 1914 through default?
notably in Nevada, where Newlands
was elected by forty plurality, and1
Wisconsin, where Husting was elect
ed by 950 plurality. There will be
no losses by default this year.
