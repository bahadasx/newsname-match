nSTGEUS
Paris, Sept. 18. For the first time
in the history or the world the French
used an aeroplane squadron to lead
thfl successful attack on the village
of Boucbavesnes, north of the

'five armored planes, each mounting
three machine guns, one pointing for
ward and two downward, charged the
German lines before the French In
fantry loft their trenches.
Flying high above this charging
air column were French aviation
Jofflcers. who directed the attack aev
jersl hundred feet below In much the
I same manner that an officer directs
I an infantry charge from a sheltered
dugout.
The French filers swooped low over
the German lines as the artillery
lifted and raked the German troncbes
' With murderous Are. Prisoners re
port that this form of attack had
( remarkable effect upon the Germans
I who had survived the artlllerylng and
were awaiting In their half ruined
I trenches the coming storm of French
infantry. It sent tbera flying In panic
down communicating trenches, and In
I some Instances, caused machine gun
crews to desert their posts,
j As the French Infantry came on
j with a rush the air chargers drove
forward to the second phase of their
jwork. Tbey flew along the roads,

i This new use of aeroplanes proved

Commissioners Representing
Two Governments Clash
Over Plans for Border
Patrol After Withdrawal
New London, Conn., Sept. 18'. The
American and Mexican commissioners
In session here today faced the first
approach to a row which bag arisen
since their sessions opened.
It waa learned that General Bliss
definitely recommended to the com
missioners the .withdrawal of the
American expedition from Mexico,
concurring with General Funston. But
the commissioners came near to a
split over what stein should be taken
as regards a border patrol after the
American withdrawal.
Mexican Commissioner Cabrera told
the Americans he could not discuss
collateral Issues on which they have
insisted. They must take up with
drawal first and finally, he said.
Resuming work after the week re
cess, the American group found 'that
Its evidence failed to show conclu
sively Carranza's ability to do all the
United States would have him do for
protection. of American Interests. The
Mexicans, on the other hand, held
that the early withdrawal of the U. S.
troops Is essential I to . progress In
quieting and reviving Mexico.
Carranza, Cabrera Indicated, has
seen stories to the effect that stress
was being laid on international af
fairs. Both Carranza and Cabrera
are displeased at this, though as a
matter of fact the American com
missioners have sought to. settle the
basic problems of Mexico before de
termining upon border matters.
Cabrera' Insisted that his powers
were limited to the discussion of with
drawal and protection ot the border.
He Indicated to newspaper men that
matters are not altogether hopeless
and that the afternoon session may
clear the atmosphere. The American
group of commissioners were silent,
though apparently disturbed.
Indications are evident that the
Mexican commissioners failed to meet
in any sort of a satisfactory degree
requirements as to their share ot the
burden of future protection, although I
the American arbiters professed no
Intent of being arbitrary.

London, Sept. 18. The most des
perate Teutonic counter-attacks have
failed to stop the onward aweep of the
Anglo-French armies on both sides
of the river 8omme. ' -..
The German war office thi after
noon admitted the loss of Berny,
Deniecourt and positions between
Barleux and Vermandovlllers in the
new French drive aouth of the river.
The capture of Deniecourt haa not yet
been announced from Paris, though
an official statement Issued at noon
reported the village surrounded The
French war office last night reported
the capture of Berny and Vermando
villern. i
North of the Somme the British
closed in on Thlepral last bight after
repulsing -.German attacks, General
Halg reported, and captured enemy
positions south of the town. '
Aside from the allies' success on
the Somme, the word that the Rus
sian and Roumanian forces have halt
ed their retreat in sooth-eastern Rou-
manla and are now making a stand
against the Teutons was the. most en
couraging news from the allied stand
point reaching London today. The
German war office announced that the
Russo-Roomanians have been rein
forced and are now preparing to give
battle to protect the important Con
stanza railway line, which guards
Roumania's communications, via the
Black sea."
A dispatch from the Rome bureau
of the United Press reported that the
Italians have broken through the
Austrian third line east of Monfal

A whole series of Austrian positions
from Oppaochiasella southward
through Pietra Rossa has been car

to trench positions In the valley.
The advanced Italian lines are now
lesa than thirteen miles from Trieste.
Heavy rain storms have Interfered
with the progress of the offensive,
preventing aerial observation and
thus impeding the artillery attack.
But, despite these Obstacles, General
Cadorna's men drove the enemy down
the eastern slopes of hills 144, 208
and several other dominant positions
holding up the Italian advance along

Attack Upon Chihaha City
by tie Rebel fficteia tii
His Followers Complicates
the Bcrder -
El Paso, Sept, 18. All northern
Mexico Is In turmoil today as reports
of VUla's attack upon Chihuahua City
early Saturday spread throughout the
country. ; Four I thousand de facto
troops from Monterey re being rush
ed to Chihuahua City and other
points, while tiro columns of cavalry
are pursuing the flying bandits to
ward Santa Clara canyon, according
to reports given out fcy General Gon
zales, Carranza - commander at
Juarez. Despite reports given out by
Carranza officials that Villa was badly
defeated, the effect of his attack fol
lowing his threat to shout "Ortto" in
the city of Chihuahua on Indepen
dence day was to rouse the enthusi
asm of tho people. , In Juarez troops
are patrolling every street In order
to prevent an outbreak of pro-Villa
feeling. Three Carraazlsta officers
who deserted when the bandit attack
ed Chihuahua arrived in El Paso to
day., v '
According to their stories, the Vil
" istas attacked the town in' two col
umns, one marching straight to the
penitentiary without a shot being
fired upon them, the other column
driving the Carranzista soldiers be
fore Shem to the palace.
When It was seen that the peni
tentiary was doomed to fall Carran
zista officers ran thro.ugh the corri
dors, shooting political prisoners
through the bars. About 20 were
killed in; that manner. Then tha
doors were broken down by the VII-
listas, who rushed In and rescued
General Salazar. V t
General Trevino, Carranzista com
mander, was shot by one ot his own
men, these officers declare, and about
one-third of the garrison mutinied
and went over to the bandit leader.
The Viliistas loBt atwut 200 men.
according to -best estimates, while
the Carranzista losses were not an
nounced, but were said to be -very
heavy. As the Villlstas lost the pri
son and started to cut their way
through the government troops, hand-
to-hand fighting took place In the
streets. The streets were swept by
shell fire, killing de facto soldiers
and bandits alike. For an hour after
Villa had evacuated it, cannon fire
was kept up on the palace. -
The Carranzistas did not imme
diately pursue when the bandits fin
ally cut their way through the lines.
Once outside, the city, the Villlstas
re-formed and marched away In good
order across the Rio Churlscar, pro
ceeding northward toward Santa
Clara canyon. ,
By military men hero it is believed
Villa did not intend to occupy Chi
huahua City, but that his purpose was
to make a demonstration for Its ef
fect upon the American-Mexican me
diation commission. .
Villa's men started evacuating the
prison before the shell fire was open
ed on them. ' The bandits suffered
their heaviest losses during their re
treat when the artillery got the range.
Some de facto estimates state that
600 Villlstas were killed or cap
tured. . t .
Reports of United States secret ser
vice agents sent to Washington today
state that the Chihuahua City attack
Saturday was a victory for Villa and
that he had accomplished all his ob
jects In entering the olty. . .
General Ynes Salazar Is said to
have been executed after his libera
tlon "by the Villlstas.
