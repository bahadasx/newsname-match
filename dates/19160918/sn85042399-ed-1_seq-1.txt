Ashland Day Is
Biggest Day at Fair
Ashland sent down a crowd of two
thousand to the county fair at Med
ford Friday, Including the Ashland
band. The stores closed for the af
ternoon, as did also the schools, and
the Pacific Highway witnessed a
steady stream of cars carrying the
hundreds to the fair. A special train
carried down several carloads and
the band, which together with the
Medford band furnished music all af
ternoon from the grandstand at the
fair grounds. It was Ashland day at
the fair in more ways than one, the
iuhinnH entrlpn cleaning ud the races
..... .
and Ashland willing all kinds .or
prizes. The Asfland district has cap-
tured the first prize among the dls-
trlcts, and
Ashland exhibitors In
every class won many blue ribbons.
The list of prizes will be published
as soon as completed.
The racing at the fair was un

of ore being hauled direct from the
mine to the railroad at present, while
he lower erades will be concentrat-1

ore before being hauled. About 30
men are at present employed at the
"Waldo, and many teams are engaged
ln hauling the ore to Waters creek.
The Waldo Copper Company In
cludes Dr. J. F. Reddy, A. H. Gun

Sutherlin Railroad
Roseburg Review A crew of en
gineers under Engineer L. O. Hicks
of Roseburg today began the work
of placing the grade stakes for the
Immediate resumption of work on the
Sutherlln-Coos Bay railroad, which
will tap the Roach Timber Company's
big holdings near Sutherlin.
It is the plan of the timber com
pany to finish the first eight-mile
unit of the road before the rains be
gin this fall, and by layfhg the steel
it will be possible to reach the two
sawmill sites, upon one of which a
200,000-feet capacity mill will be
built during the winter or spring.
The plans for the mill are now
being drawn by Chief Engineer N.
A. Pracna of the Weyerhauser Com
pany, of Seattle. General Freight
Agent H. A. Hlnshaw pf the South
ern Pacific Company conferred with
Manager R. M. Fox of the Roach
Timber Company yesterday with re
gard to the transportation of ma
chinery and supplies for the develop
ment of the project. During a re
cent visit at Sutherlin, Frank J. Mil
ler of the Oregon Public Service Com
mission passed upon the road cross
ings over the Roach company's pro
posed line.
President Sproule of the S. P. sys
tem says now that the railroad is
completed into Coos Bay they Intend
to develop the Beaver Hill coal mine
to the fullest possibilities.
Prlnevllle Is voting $100,000
bonds to aid In financing construc
tion of a railroad from the malne
line of the Oregon trunk to that city.
According to recent statistics, the
Oregon Brass Works do a $225,000
business annually.
Trustees Recommend Bade Plan
As First Step in District Irrigation
The first definite statement which
has been issued by the board of
trustees of the Talent Irrigation dis
trict in regard to the Immediate fu1
tura plans is Included in a letter
which the board will send out to all
the landowners of the district and a
copy of which is printed herewith.
The board has been holding frequent
and lengthy sessions, spending a
great amount of time and careful
study on every phase of the situa
tion, and finally arrived at the con
clusion that recommendation of the
project of Contractor Bade was the
best move toward securing water.
C. F. Hade's Plan..
Mr. Bade's plan is to utilize the
run-off waters of Ashland, Neil and
Emigrant creeks. The work which
he will do Is privately financed and
if proper co-operation with the land
owners is met with will put water on
a great portion of the land in the
Ashland-Talent district by the 1917
season. All of the canals which Mr.
Bade's company Installs will be un
der the direction of the engineers of
the district trustees and the Bade
system ja'hen completed will make
the first unit of the plan. No bonds
of any kind will be Issued for this
Bade construction. When the main
system from a reservoir In Beaver
creek district. Fish lake, or wherever
It may be located, is constructed, the
Bade canals will furnish part of the
system. The approval of the board
of trustees of the Bade plan should
result in the early acceptance of the
Bade contract.
Hanly Would Make
Ashland His Home
"I will never forget the time when
I was here before and climbed Mt.
Ashland and watched the Alfijiglit;
make a morning," declared J. Frank
Hanly, ex-governor of Indiana and
prohibition candidate for president
of the United States, as the Introduc
tion to his Speech at the Chautauqua
tabernacle Saturday evening. . "I
have been ln every city in the United
States, and if I had my choice of
places to live I would spend the last
of my days in Ashland." Mr. Hanly
then launched into a glowing tribute
to Ashland, which he learned to love
upon the occasion of a lengthy visit
while touring the country on the
Chautauqua platform some time ago.
A crowd of over three hundred
people had patiently waited from 8
o'clock, tie hour set for the opening
of the evening's program, until 9:15
when the prohibition candidates
finally arrived. Mr. Hanly's speech
repaid all for the long wait, howev
er, and left an impresison in Ash
land which will make votes for his
cause. He dwelt at some length upon
his objections to the saloon, stating
his principal objection to be the fact
that it threatened free government.
The two leading parties were both
"roasted" because of their failure to
take a firm stand on the prohihlton
question, which Mr. Hanly proclaim
ed to be the greatest national issue
of the day. Coming to Oregon's
problems, the results gained by the
dry law passed last year were "com
mended, the so-called brewers'
amendment which is to be voted
upon at the coming election was con
demned, and his hearers were ad
vised to exert all their Influence on
behalf of the amendment which pre
vents shipment of liquor into the
state.
"Our reception everywhere has
been most cordial," Mr. Hanly said
"Thousands have listened to us every
day, always with courteous attention
and nearly everywhere with sympa
thetic interest. This has been espec
ially true In the dry states of North
Dakota, Washington and Oregon.
Men and women have vied with one
another In the heartiness of their
handclasps, goodspeed and assur
ances that though they have not
heretofore voted the prohibition
ticket they Intend to do so this year.
Dr. Ira Landrith, candidate for
vice-president, also spoke and made
a very pleasing Impression.
The party spent Sunday morning
quietly in Ashland and left at 1
o'clock on their special train for
Dunsmuir, Cal., where they opened
the campaign in California.
Nine cars of cattle, four of hay
and two of vetch seed left Harris
burg, Ore., in one day for different
parts of the country.
The Letter.
Office of Board of Trustees of the
Talent Irrigation District.
Talent, Ore., Sept. 16, 1916.
To the Citizens of the Talent Irriga
tion District,
Your board of trustees realizing
that it would be Impossible to pro
cure Irrigation for 1917 and feeling
that the people desire progress as
rapidly as possible, some time ago
sought to develop some means under
which relief could be furnished as
many members of the district as pos
sible, and at the same time start act
ual construction work along the dis
trict plans.
We are gratified to state that we
have interested C. E. Bade, a large
contractor, In our project and he is
how offering to you as Individuals a
contract to meet our views of the
situation and which contract is not
only approved by the board, its en
gineer and attorney, but which we
recommend to all land owners. The
canals under this contract are to be
constructed upder plans approved by
your board, and when complete will
be the first unit for our permanent
district scheme. The contract pro
vides that the district may, upon no
tice, purchase these contracts and
this we expect to do.
The plan contemplates the diver
sion and use of such unappropriated
waters as may exist in Emigrant,
Nell and Ashland creeks. The rec
ords show that there will be suffi
cient water available to warrant this
expenditure.
In order to make possible the con
struction of said canals and the de
livery of water for 1917. as stated,
It is necessary that the contracts be
executed and delivered by October 1,
1916, and we urge that you give this
your immediate and earnest atten
tion, , .

Fort Klamath to
Here in Six Hours
That the road from Ashland to
Pelican Bay Is open for automobiles
and offers no very bad places for
the motorist is proven by the trip
made from Fort Klamath last week
by Mr. and Mrs. Fred Nell and K.
Looseley in the letter's Chevrolet
car. . The distance is a trifle over
seventy miles, including approxi
mately thirty miles around Klamath
Lake from Fort Klamath to Pelican
Bay lodge, which is in fine shape,
the twelve miles from the lodge to
Lake of the Woods, which is pass
able, and the distance from Lake of
the Woods on In to Ashland, which
is traveled by numbers of automo
biles every Sunday. The party start
ed from the fort at noon and arrived
In Ashland at 5:55 p. m., a little
less than six hours for the trip,
which ln stage coach days took the
biggest part of two days. Extensive
improvements have lately been made
on the road and next spring should
see it put ln first-class shape by
some means.
Frank Hogan, who has been liv
ing in Ashland for the past year and
a half, left this morning for Water
bury, Conn., where he will spend an
extended visit.

Largest Siskiyou
. Copper Mine Sold
The Grey Eagle mine near Happy
Camp, on the Klamath river road,
the largest developed copper property
in Siskiyou county, has been pur
chased by W. B. Thompson of New
York, the noted mining magnate.
Engineers state that the property
contains fully 600,000 tons of devel
oped chalcopyrlte ore, averaging 5
per cent copper, and that the mine
promises to be the greatest copper
property In California, after the
Mammoth at Kennett.
For years the property has been
vigorously developed by Dakln & Far
ish of San Francisco, and several out
side holdings have been added to the
original locatjon. It is stated that
the new owner will immediately start
extensive developments and that a
large reduction plant probably will be
erected early In 1917.
The deal is expected to have a
greatly stimulating effect on mining
throughout the Happy Camp field.
The Marin Andrews placer mine,
near Scott Bar, has been sold to R.
J.. Barber and associates of Boston,
who are preparing to operate along
greatly broadened lines. The prop
erty adjoins the noted Milne mine,
and has been producing almost con
stantly for sixty years.
Numerous companies ln the Happy
Camp, Forks of Salmon, Sawyers Bar,
Scott Bar and other placer districts
are preparing for a brisk season with
the first fall rains.
Ten-Year-Old Girl
Longs to Return
A lonesome little ten-year old girl,
way back in Cedar Bluffs on the dry
Kansas plains wrote the following
parody on Tlpperary In a moment
when thoughts of her little school
mates, the hills and the green of her
Ashland home made the Kansas exile
seem almost unendurable. The little
girl is Esther Wright, granddaughter
of Mrs. A. R. Wright of this city and
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. L. A.
Wright, former Ashland residents,
who have been ln the east for the
past year but will soon return to
Ashland:
"It's a long way to Ashland, Oregon,
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Ashland, Oregon,
Where the lithia waters flow.
Goodbye, Cedar Bluffs,
Farewell, Kansas plains,
It's a long, long way to Ashland, Ore
gon, But I'm going back there."
Scandinavian
Concert Success
A concert was given in Lithia park
Sunday which Is probably unique In
the musical annals of the state. Un
der the auspices of the Rogue River
Valley Scandinavian Society, an or
ganization which includes several
hundred former residents of Norway
and Sweden, the Ashland band gave
a concert of Scandinavian music.
The band has been working for sev
eral weeks in preparation for this
concert and executed the unusual
and difficult music In a manner
which won great commendation.
Several hundred Scandinavians at
tended the concert and the usually
large Sunday crowd, totalling about
3,000 persons ln all.
The bandstand was decorated with
the flags of the Scandinavian coun
tries. The band had a full Instru
mentation of twenty-six pieces and
the music was unusually good. The
playing of the "Stars and Stripes
Forever" and "The Star Spangled
Banner" at the close of the program
aroused an ovation such has seldom
greeted the efforts of any band ln
Ashland.
Big Northern
Cal. Ranch sold
H. H. Hudson and Lou Edmonds
have purchased the Jack Gilpin
ranch, consisting of 615 northern
California acres, together with all
stock and tools. The purchase price,
It Is said, was $25,000. It is located
about four miles south of Montague
ln Siskiyou county, California.
It Is announced that actual grad
ing on the new railroad at Sutherlin
will start at once.
Last Band Concert
Wednesday Night
The final concert of the Ashland
band for the 1916 season, providing
arrangements are not made to ex
tend the concert season, will be pre
sented on Wednesday evening of this
week, commencing promptly at 7:45
o'clock. The Ashland band at the
close of the season is playing fine
music, having enjoyed the benefits of
playing together twice a week in con
cert and two practices a week for the
past several months. The band will
present full Instrumentation and the
best concert of the summer as a fit
ting finale to a season of fine music.

Lowe Exhibits
Ideal New Wheat
D. M. Lowe, southern Oregon "dry
farmer" who has won highest honors
at every big exposition and land
jshow ln the United States for many
years with his dry farm exhibits, ex
hibited at the Jackson county fair
jlast week some wheat which he be-
lieves Is absolutely the best wheat
.Oregon can grow. The Sperry Flour
J Company sent Mr. Lowe fifteen
I pounds of the wheat last year, Mr.
! Lowe raining 21 bushels at the rater
of 44 bushels to the acre from the
small amount sent. The Sperry com
pany secured the first bushel at a
cost of $6,000, according to Mr.
Lowe, an expert working severaT
years to produce It. Mr. Lowe was
one of the farmers throughout th
United States who were sent smaH
amounts of the original wheat, which;
is called Sperry wheat. The 21
bushels which Mr. Lowe raised will
he distributed In small amounts'
among the farmers of Rogue River
valley so that by theend of next
year a good record will be had of the
performances of the grain on every
type of soil and under the conditions
In every part of the valley. A
The wheat Mi. Lowe planUd was
sowed on light, dry land, but during?
the hot spells was not In the least
affected. The product Mr. Lowe
shows at the county fair Is beautlfur
wheat, uniform, fat grains with a
high gloss. He states that analysis
has shown It to contain a remark
ably high proportion of flower ele
ments, so high that he is willing to
stake his reputation that the Sperry
wheat Is the coming wheat for Ore
gon to grow.
Much more grain Is being raised
In the valley this year than since the
years prior to the fruit boom, and' a
great deal more interest is being
taken ln grain raising. To exemplify
this la the fact that at the county
fair this year there were thirty ex
hibits of grain collections as against
six In 1915.
Ashland Garage
Changes Ownership
W. J. Albert assumed charge of
the Ashland garage Thursday of last
week, taking It over from C. F. Ham
mlt, who has been running It for the
past several months. Mr. Hammit re
turns this week to his home In Santa
Ana, Cal. Mr. Albert has had con
siderable experience in the garage
business and has the knowledge and
the equipment at the new garage to
turn out good work.
The Bay Park mill near North
Bend has started with a crew of 60
men.
