SAYS CHAMP CLARK
He Lauds Missouri Congress
men at Opening of Dem
ocratic Rally.
REED TALKS FINANCE
Missouri Senator Upholds
Proposed Land Bank
. Measure.
Champ Clark sajs:
The great Issue in the cam
paign is peace.
Hughes has not been mak
ing speeches, he has just been
"twaddling."
The Income tax will never be
repealed.
The rural credit bill is a
Democratic-sent blessing to the
farmer.
Agriculture is the foundation
of prosperity. Therefore the
farmer must be looked after.
The Good Roads Bill, recently
passed by congress is mostly
due to the work of Congressman
D. W. Shackelford, chairman of
the good roads committee in the
House of Representatives.
The Democrats want to be
judged by what they have done.
The Republicans want to be
judged by what they will do
when they get in power.
Roosevelt,. The Federal Reserve sys
tem was thoroughly explained by the
senator, who gave special emphasis
to the benefits received by the farmers
of the country through the measure.
Senator Reed said in part:
"I think I can show eery Bull
Mooser in this audience that, since
his leader, Mr. Roosevelt, betrayed
him, the only recourse he has is to
join the Democratic ranks. 1 think
I can make every old-time Democrat
who is grumbling from any pet griev
ance feel ashamed of his actions. The
Gardner Land Bank Bill is financially
sound, and is shaped along the lines
of the land bank bills of France and
other foreign countries. The Gardner
Land Bank Bill will stand, said Mr.
Reed.
"The acid test has been put to the
Federal Resere system by the pres
ent European war. Not only has the
country been free from panic, but we
have been able to loan the warring
nations the enormous sum of $1,500,
000,000," said Mr. Reed.
Senator Reed concluded with a re
view of the accomplishments of Presi
dent Wilson.

Notes of the Rally
Champ Clark, wearing a spoUess
white bow tie and collar, sat in the
lobby of the Athens Hotel this morn
ing, chewing good old Missouri leaf
tobacco and meeting Columbia friends
and state politicians.
Congressman D. W. Shackelford,
wearing a huge sweater, motored from
Jefferson City to attend the rally. He
said the sweater was not worn to keep
him from getting cold feet but to keep
the north winds from passing through
his summer garments.
Before a crowd of more than 5,000
people massed in a huge tent. Speaker
Champ Clark this afternoon fired the
first gun of the Democratic campaign
in Boone County by combating the ar
guments that have been put forward
by Republican nominee Charles E.
Hughes in recent speeches and then
proceeded to laud the administration
of President "Wilson.
Speaker Clark began by urging the
Democrats of Boone County to not
only re-elect President Wilson but to
also otc the complete Democratic
ticket.
"Vote 'er straight from President
to constable," cried out the speaker.
"Without a Democratic Congress, the
President would be less powerful
than a painted ship on a painted sea."
"I dont want to. abuse Hughes in
my speech," continued Clark, "but I
have a right to express my honest
opinions of a man. For ten days, the
Republican presidential nominee de
nounced the administration because of
the removal of a minor office holder.
I do not call that talk; I call it
"twaddle."
The huge meeting was called to or
der by L. L. Burnett of Ashland,
chairman of the Boone County Demo
cratic committee, who Introduced the
permanent chairman, State Senator
Frank Harris of Columbia.
Ashland Man Introduces Clark.
In introducing Speaker Clark, Mr.
Harris said that the speaker was a
man that all Missouri loved and hon
ored because he has always stood for
the common people against the corporations.
"Missouri has the best delegation in
Congress," began Speaker Clark,
"Senator James A. Reed is the best
debater in the United States and Con
gressman D. W. Shackelford is a lead
er in his division. You must re-elect
them."
Speaker Clark spent much time on
the benefits of the income tax. He
finished by again lauding the Mis
souri delegation at Washington. He
said that Congressman Shackelford is
responsible for the Good Roads Bill
that will make for good roads in this
country.
Clark Praises Senator Stone.
"Senator William J. Stone has been
a greater pillar to President Wilson
in this administration than any other
man," said Mr. Clark. "As chairman
of the senate committee on foreign re
lations, Mr. Stone has helped make
way for the President past the many
crisis and obstacles."
Speaker Clark was followed by
State Auditor Gordon who gave fig
ures justifying the present adminis
tration. He said that there has been
no extravagance under the present
state regime.
Reed Talks Finance.
United States Senator James A.
Reed, the final speaker, upheld the
present administration by comparing
its present financial status to condi
tions under presidenents Taft and
H. J. Higgs, assistant United States
district attorney, is one of those Demo
cratic fellows that can't keep away
from a good old political rally. He
said he "just had to come."

(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
EL PASO, Tex.. Sept .18. All north
ern Mexico is in turmoil today as re
ports of Villa's attack on Chihuahua
City early Saturday spread through
out the country. Four thousand de
facto troops from Monterey are
moving to Chihuahua City and other
points, while two columns of cavalry'
are pursuing the flying bandits to
ward Santa Clara Canyon.
Despite reports given out by Car
ranzista officials that Villa was badly
defeated, the effect of his attack fol
lowing his threat to shout "Grito" in
the city of Chihuahua on Indepence
Day was to arouse the enthusiasm
of the people.
Three Carranzista officers, who de
serted when the bandit attack com
menced and rode north to catch a
train, arrived at El Paso today.
According to their story, the Vil
listas attacked the town in two
columns, one marching straight to
the penitentiary without a shot being
fired upon them, the other driving the
Carranzistas before them to the pal
ace.
When it was seen that the peniten
tiary was doomed to fall. Cirranra of
ficers ran through the corridors,
shooting political prisoners throima
the bars. About twenty were kl'led
in that manner, and then the doors
were broken down toy the Villistas,
who rushed in and rescued GeTeral
'Salazar.
General TreUno, Caran.isti com-'
mander, was shot by one of his own
men, these officers declare1!, and about
one-third of the garrison niutluh-d and
went oter to the bandit leader.
The Villistas lost about 200 men,
according to best estimates lwre. The
Carranzista losses were not an
nounced but were said to be very
heavy.
As the Villistas left the prison and
started to cut their way through the
government troops, hand to hand fight
ing took place in the sttreets. The
streets were swept by shell firing, kill
ing de facto soldiers and bandits alike.
For an hour after Villa had evacuated
it, cannon fire was turned upon the
palace.
The Carranzistas did not immediate
ly pursue when the bandits cut their
way through the lines. Once outside
the city the Villistas re-formed and
marched away In good order, proceed
ing north toward Santa Clara Valley.
Military men here believe Villa did
not intend to occupy Chihuahua CItv
but that his purpose was to make a
demonstration for its effect upon the
American-Mexican Mediation Commis
sion.

THE WEATHER
The speakers' stand at the rally
was a blaze of flags and banncrj.
Right over the speaker's table hung
a huge banner, a photograph of Prcsl
dent Wilson, with the Inscription,
"Peace and Prosperity are ours."
Senator Robinson or Arkansas for
some unknown reason failed to show
up. It said that he made some mis
take in railroad connections.
Fred D. Gardner, Democratic can
didate for governor will return from
California Saturday to open his cam
paign, according to Speaker Champ
Clark.
The Rev. A. W. Pasley, known as
the "Cupid Preacher" attended the
rally donned In a new fall overcoat.
Thirty Columbia women suffragists
wearing streaming yellow riDDons
mingled in the crowd at the rally ex
pounding woman suffrage.
Just after Speaker Champ Clark
finished his speech, two of them lift
ed a huge banner bearing the inscrip
tion, Woman Suffrage. As the ban
ner was lifted, a woman cried out,
What about woman suffrage, what
about woman suffrage?" Champ Clark
mumbled a few words and took his
seat.
Bliss Urges American Withdrawal.
By United Press.
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 18.
The American and Mexican conferees
in session here today faced the first
situation resembling a row which has
arisen since the aeseiin opened, when
it was learned that General Bliss defi
nitely recommended to the commis
sioners the withdrawal of the Ameri
can expedition from Mexico, after con
ferring with General Funston. The
commissioners came near to a dead
lock as to what steps should be taken
as regards border patrol if the Ameri
cans withdrew.
Mexican Commissioner Cabrera
fold the Americans he could not dis
cuss collateral issues on which they
have insisted They must take up
withdrawal first and finally, lit- taid.

Owing to the new methods of en
rollment it was impossible to de
termine the exact number of students
signed up in the University at the end
of the first day of registration. Re
ceipts were ready for 2,361 who had
sent in their student cards before to
day, but it was impossible to deter
mine how many of these receipts had
been taken out. At 4 o'clock this aft
ernoon 88 additional receipts had
been made out, making a total en
rollment of 2,449. Last year's first
day registration was 1,444, while 2,
648 registered during the first four
days. Only 199 students need to en
roll during the next three days to
equal the first four days registration
of last year.
The new regime of unhazed fresh
men was ushered in at the University
today. With few exceptions the first-
year students appeared this morning
with well known caps the insignia
of their supposed incipiency. Most
had removed all high school adorn
ments and toned down whatever ten
dencies they had toward boisterous
apparel. Modest white ties and socks
of the conventional black were much
in eidence, showing a disposition on
the part of the freshman to meet the
erstwhile terrible sophomores half
way in the new reign of brotherhood
ana mercy, wnen the new comers
had occasion to address the older men
they did so in a respectful voice and
were answered in soft tones and in a
kindly-voice.
Freshmen Get Information.
Members of the student senate and
student council formed a perambu
lating information bureau for the
guidance of freshmen through the va
rious phases of registration. They
roamed through the corridors of Aca
demic Hall with miens that invited
interrogation, ably supplementing the
regularly established sources of infor
mation. The annual proclamations,
with which the sophomore class or
members of the class seek to inspire
fear into the freshman ranks appeared
as per schedule this morning in the
usual places. They were about as
unoriginal as those of the previous
year. The same old demands were
made in the same old phrases and few
paused to read them as they hurried
to "enter up." As means of overaw
ing the freshmen they are not in the
same class with an M sweater. The
only inconvenience they caused was
to the workmen of the University who
spent the greater part of the morning
removing them from the walks and
bulletin boards about the campus.
Usual Horseplay Missing.
Air fn all the freshmen were treat
ed in a most brotherly and gentleman
ly manner. None of the customary
horseplay was in evidence about the
campus during the day. The air was
not rent with high school yells, given
under pressure. The old, hackneyed
call of "Hey Freshman," was absent
as was the kindred sight of a scut
tling boy coming to a sudden halt or
increasing his speed as the circum
stances seemed to justify. The new
treatment is manifesting itself in the
carriage and appearance of the bene
ficiaries. They have abandoned the
sprinter's crouch and the hunted look
has vanished from their eyes.
Half a hundred exponents of the
old regime gathered at Missouri ave
nue and Rollins street about 10
o'clock last night where they put a
dozen freshmen through the old fa
miliar antics. They were in the midst
of the ceremonies when the police ar
rived in the police car. The mob dis
persed before tfe officers could dis
mount. The hazers were scattered to
the four winds leaving only the fresh
men in the clutches of the law. No
arrests were made. The police today
reitered their statement of Sunday
to the effect that anyone found haz
ing within the city limits would be
subject to a long and solitary con
finement in the city jail.
Bales for Freshmen.
The sheriff has Jurisdiction in the
county and is said to be -strongly op

FOR MULE COLTS
Three of the Four Prize
Winners at County Fair
Are Sold.
More than 400 farmers and towns
men were at the Courthouse square at
1:30 o'clock this afternoon for the
auction of the mule colts that took
prizes at the Boone County Fair Sep
tember 4. The mules were put on sale
by the Retail Merchants' Association
of Columbia which became the owner
of the colts upon payment of the prize
purses to the former owners.
Three of the four prize winners
that brought their owners $715 in
prizes at the fair brought a total of
$570 for the association. The auction
was conducted by John C. Schwabe of
this city. The sales were as fol
lows:
First prize winner, formerly owned
by Tilford Murry of Columbia, sold
to Thomas H. Armstrong, living
northwest of Columbia, for $197.50,
Second prize winner, formerly own
ed by F. Brockmann of Clifton Hills,
sold to J. C. Jones of Hallsville for
$210.
Fourth prize winner, formerly own
ed by Tilford Murry of Columbia,
sold to Thomas H. Armstrong, living
northwest of Columbia, for $162.50.
The third prize winner was kept
by its owner, A. F. Bailew of Cen
tralia, who forfeited all but $40 of
his $175 prize.
Considerable interest was aroused
in the sale of a mule colt brought to
Columbia by S. P. Keene from Moni
teau County especially for the sale
today. The colt was bought by T. R.
Hayden of Huntsdale for $200.
Auctioneers were busy on both sides
of the rope arena where the prize
winners were auctioned, disposing of
stock of lower caliber to buyers who
did not care to bid in three figures.
