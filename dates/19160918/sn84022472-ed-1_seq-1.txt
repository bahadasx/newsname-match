politics. . . , .
Judge Peck modestly admits that
the voters will -do well to elect' him

better selectman in . the .town 'of
Stratford than wasjr. Curtiss."
Oscar Swanson is chosen for a place
on 'the board of assessors. ' Leader
Peck allegeld that the western part of
the town needs an assessor.V "In Mr.
Swanson," he writes, "you will find a
capable an4 faithful man. . He is very
familiar with the values of land and
in my. mind will make an excellent as
sessor. , .
The judge and Walter J. Hanford
are candidates for the general assem
bly. 'Mr. Hanford Is a man whoVhas
the good will and respect of the whole
community," he writes, "and it would
