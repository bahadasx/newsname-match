(BY HENRY WOOD.)
PARIS, Sept 18. It I learned for
the first time In the world's history
that the French used an aeroplane
squadron to lead a successful attack
on Bouchavesnes village north of the
Somme. Twenty fast armored aero
planes each carrying three machine
guns charged the German lines before
the infantry left the trenches. Offi
cers flew high over the attacking
squadron directing the assault The
machines swooped low over the Ger
man lines directing a murderous fir.
Prisoners reported the new attack
caused the Germans to flee in a pan
ic. The squadron flew along the roads,
attacking the reserves approaching
the battle field. The new aeroplanes
used proved so successful the allies
intend to use them frequently here
after. OF ROUND-UP BACK
