MAINTAIN OLD RATES;
PENDING LONG TIME
PHOENIX, June 2. The three cent
passenger fare on the lines of the
, Santa Pe and Southern Pacific, and
rales ' three and one-half and four
j cents a m"e on the Arizona Eastern
I are Prescribed in an order of the Ari-
zona corporation commission Issued
,oda3r- Three cents a mile is also
Prescribed on the line of the Ray and
Gila valley Railroad. Existing pas
senger rates on other railroads opera
ting in Arizona are not disturbed by
the order, which becomes eective
August 1.
The commlsion's order affects all
''"' Iin"s of "" Santa Fo and South
! Prn Pacific within the state, includ
ing both main and branch lines, or
j lines heing operated under lease. The
',hree CPnt rate' noweTer-does not p-
' l,,v to the Arizona Eastern railroad, a
, subsidiary of the Southern Pacific
company, connecting Phoenix and the
' Salt River valley with the main line
of the Southern Pa-tflc at Maricopa,
1 and the Globe Miami district with the
main line at Bowie.
The passenger fare on th Arizona
Eastern is fixed at four cents a mile
on the Golbe and Cochise divisions
and at three nd one-half cents on
the Phoenix clvfslon, which Includes
the line to Florence, Hayden and Win
kelman. The order as It affects the
Arizona Eastern is effective for ninety
days, at the end of which time the
road Is to furnish the commission
with certain data to be prescribed to
expenses and profits under the new
order.
The commission's order is the re
sult of an exhaustive Investigation
of passenger rates within the state
of Arizona. When Arizona became a
state one of the first Mi's to pass
the legislature provided for three
rent fare on all rallroadj In the
state. A referendum wa- invoked
'.iinst the measure, but bjfore the
ii.xt election the state suprerie court
handed down a decision which left
all regulation of railroad rates to the
corporation commission. The re
ferred measure was approved by a
large majority at the general election
in I"14, bin Ihe vote on the question
had no effect at that time in the light
of the supreme court decision.
Existing parsenger rates range
from four to ten cents a mile, the
-iter high tate applying on some oi
i.ie smaller rrfcds to mining camps.
Intend to circulate a statewide peti
tion requcstin the Igislature to
abolish the office and adminster the
game laws In a different manner.
It is claimed that the cost of main
raining the office is excessive and that
it is not attaining the ends for which
It is maintained. It is also claimed
that greater efficiency may be at
tained by some other method at a
less cost. A commission of three
members has been suggested.
The present movement la said to be
connected with the fight of sportsmen
throughout the state against many
of the policies of Stale Game Warden
Wlllard.
