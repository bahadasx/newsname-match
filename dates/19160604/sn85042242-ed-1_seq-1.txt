FIVE DISTRICTS
paving Committee Will Have De
Unite Scheme for Com*
mission.
€OOD PROGRESS
IS BEING MADE
Details Can Be Arranged Early
So Some Work Can Be Done
Very Soon.
Five paving districts will be creat­
ed by the city commission if present
plans do not miscarry. The special
paving committee of, which R. C. Bat
tey is chairman, has a tentative plan
to place before the city commission
at its meeting tomorrow evening.
The first district will take in the
business district and probably a bet­
ter material will be used here than is
necessarj elsewhere because of the
heavy traific on the downtown streets.
In the second district will be all
other territory included in paving pe­
titions now before the city commis­
sion and to be paved at this time.
Other districts are: third, east side of
the city fourth, west side, and fifth,
south of the tracks.
In Two Districts Only.
Paving, however, is only contem­
plated in the first and second districts
but the districts will be created so
that if the property owners ask for
the improvement the preliminary
steps of creating a district will not
be necessary.
The impression that any streets
are to be widened is erroneous. All
paving will be laid with a view to
meet the I attire development or Bis­
marck. In the business section It is
proposed to have a street 4S l'eet
wide and all sidewalks of uniform
width. On the residence streets, how­
ever, it is Ihoueht that 30 feet is suffi­
cient for the street width and the rest
can be used for sidewalks and park­
ing. This will reduce the coat of pav­
ing in residence districts materially.
T«-Det»rmtoe-Limits
It is Or problem-now, however, to, de­
termine just what limits should be as­
signed to the business district. Ten­
tatively the committee ia considering
making the following the business
districts:
No. 1: On Main street from Man
dah avenue to Seventh street Broad­
way from Second to Seventh on
Thayer" from Third to Sixth, and on
intersecting streets to square the
aboye area.
Steps may be taken next Monday to
compel every property owner-to make
sewer and. water connections so as to
prevent tearing up the pavement. If
property owners fail to comply, the
work may Tie done by the city and the
expense charged to the property. All
roof drains in the business section
will have to be connected with the
storm instead of sanitary sewers as
a't present.
Sewer Extensions.
Some extensions of the storm sew­
ers will have to be made to furnish a
storm drainage system for the first
paving district. This is for the en­
gineering department to work out.
City Engineer Atkinson is at work
on the details and will submit a ten­
tative plan soon. While the paving
committee has confidence in Mr. At­
kinson, it has been deemed advisable
to secure the services of an expert
paving engineer. City Engineer At­
kinson will have charge of the work
and the special engineer will act in
an advispry capacity. In view of the
importance of the project, the paving
committee feels that special expert
assistance should be employed.
As soon as a definite plan is before
the commission, a conference will be
held with the advisory paving com­
mittee selected by the Commercial
club. It is hoped that details will be
handed down within the next few
weeks so that bids can fce asked on
the various materials.

PARADE IS BIG
'A
Greatest Procession Ever Seen,
Files Through the Streets
of Chicago.
WAS A GREAT AND
INSPIRING SPECTACLE
Chicago, June 2—The greatest pa­
rade ever held in Chicago finished to­
night, after 230,240 persons, one-sixth
of whom were women, had filed
through the. streets in the prepared­
ness demonstrations. The parade was
11 1-2 hours in passing. More than
1,000,000 persons are estimated to
have witnessed it. The night divi­
sion was made up largely of military
organizations, which included all
branches of the army and navy serv­
ice.
The preparedness parade was said
hy Major General Thomas 11. Berry,
commander of the Central Depart­
ment, IT. S. A., who sat in the review­
ing stand, to be the greatest and
most inspiring spectacle he had ever
seen.
massed from curb to curb, rolled like
the tide through the streets all daj*.
It was like as if the skyscrapers
were the bank of a river and each
with an American flag, the current
moving between them. It impressed
by its bulk, and by the absence of
the hilarity accompanying the parade.
There were no floats and little of the
holiday spirit present. The airs play
ed by the band were either patriotic
or military. Patriotic songs were
sung or whistled, for few knew the
words. They did better occasionally
with hymns. Most of the marchers
knew the words of "Onward, Chris
tian Soldiers," a hymn which seemed
to strike the paraders as appropriate
to the occasion. A division of clergy­
men carried off the singing honors
They knew the words of every song
they attempted, including "America'"
and "The Star Spangled Banner."
The precision with which the pa­
rade moved was itself said to be a
lesson in preparedness, for it was han­
dled by Captain Raymond Sheldon of
the regular army by a system of tele­
phones.

FIMIE BW TO NOTE
Difference of Opinion as to Char­
acter of the Communis
Cation-
Washington, June 3.—President
Wilson probably will take up with
Secretary Lansins Monday the ques­
tion of framing a reply to Gen. Car
ranza's new note that the Ameircan
troops be withdrawn from Mexico.
Because of what are deemed offen­
sive references and offensive state­
ments in the note, some officials think
the reply should be sharp in charact­
er and carry a rebuke for the seem­
ing discourtesy. Others suggest,
however, that because communication
prefaces its unusual utterances with
the staement that it proposes to be
entirely frank and hopes the sensi­
bilities of the United States govern­
ment will not be wounded, that the
reply will confine itself to recruiting
misstatements, and a firm expression
of the intention of the United States
to keep the expedition into Mexico
until Carranza has demonstrated his
ability to ocntrol the situation.
Secretary Baker conferred with the
president today on the Mexican ques­
tion but the particular aspects dis­
cussed were not disclosed. While de­
tails of the Pershing-Gavira confer­
ence have not been made known, it is
known that no suggestions for an
agreement as to local troop disposi­
tion was made, the conversation con­
sisting for the most part of state­
ments bv the Mexican field command­
er of what steps he was taking \fo

against danger of clashes between
Mexican and American troops..

Duluth, Minn., June 3.—Rush G. Es­
tee, New York broker and club man,
who seriously vanished Wednesday
night from Kenneth P. Van Riper's
yacht, Rambler, in Duluth harbor, was
found today in Minneapolis. His pres­
ence there was the result of an in­
tended robbery and a blow in the
dark that affected his memory.
"1 left the yacht shortly after mid­
night Wednesday evening, and, taking
a canoe, paddled about the bay, hear
the docks," says Mr. Estee. "Then
I decided to make a visit to the shore
and paddled to the dock. As I made
my way along the pier, two men who
had noticed my landing stepped from
the shadows of the piling, near which
they were lurking, and confronted me,
demanding my money.
"I showed fight and was struck
over the head with, I believe, a black­
jack."
Estee wired Van Riper he would
not rejoin the Rambler party, which
he joined two weeks ago at Manito­
woc, Wis. The broker said that he
intends leaving for Chicago Sunday,
where he will meet his father, James
B. Estee of Montpelier, Vt., who was
on bis way west to seek his son.
The 'Rambler will leave tomorrow for
eastern Lake points, following a be­
lated departure caused by Estee's dis­
appearance.

La$# EditioniM^-$'
Berlin has issued no further atate
ment regarding the German losses
which initially yere given as on*
battleship, two light cruisers, and
several destroyers.
If the revised British reports ar*
accepted, the loss in ships was ap«
proximately as follows:
British Losses.
Three battle cruisers (Queen, Mary,
Indefatigable and Invincible.)
Three armored cruisers (Defenssy
Black Prince and Warrior).
About a dozen destroyers and pot
submarine.
German Losses.
Two battleships (Westfalen an4
Pomrneron).
Two battle cruisers (unnamed).
Four light cruisers (including thf
Wiesbaden, Elbind and Frauenlob).
Six destroyers and a submarine.
The British admiralty, in addition*
has admitted that the battleship Marl*
borough was struck by a torpedo, but
declare^. she~wa» .towed, safely, to poet,
It denies the German claim that ths
dreadnaught Warspite was sunk, at*
though conceding that she was dam*
aged by gunfire.
Germans Elated.
The Germans are greatly elated At
the outcome of the engagement In
which their main fleet, under Admiral
Scheer, met the British, whose main
fleet, they assert, also was engaged.
That the Germans held the field after
the battle is shown, they declare, b"
the fact that the Germans picked tip'
survivors of British warships that
went down.
London officially denies that the
British grand fleet was in the action.
The battle cruiser squadron, which ia
reported to have rushed between the
Germans and their base, seems to
have borne the brunt of the fight.
Eleven British battleships eventually
went into the battle, it is admitted,
but of these several are declared to
have been only partly engaged.
Losses Heavy.
The British losses in officers waa
extremely heavy, the list including
Rear Admiral Horace Hood, who went
down with his flagship, the Invincible^
Captain Sowerby, of the Indefatig­
able Captain Kay of the Invincible,
and Captain Prowse, of the Queen
Mary. The total British losses are es­
timated at about 5,000.
Zeppelin Driven Off*
A British admiralty official made a
statement reviewing the battle in
some detail. He declared that the
British went out looking for a light,
engaged the entire German high sea
fleet, interrupted its plans and droTe
it back to port. The Germans, be
said, sprung no surprises. Only on*
Zeppelin was seen and that was driv­
en off.
A semi-official statement Issued in
Berlin declares that the Germans fac­
ed the greater part of the modern
British navy, the battle cruisers, and
light cruisers beginning the engage­
ment, while later both forces took
part in the attack. German torpedo
boats did notable work, Jtoth during
the daylight battle and during the
night, while naval airships and aero­
planes contributed greatly to the Ger­
man success, it is claimed.
Gains At Verdun.
In the land fighting, the Germans
have made further progress on the
Verdun front, gaining ground on the
Vaux sector, northeast of the fortress,
and beating off .French attacks. They
also scored success against British ia
Belgium, capturing heights near Vii
leeke, southeast of «Yp*es The Ans*
trians claim the gaining of additional
ground against the Italians in tho
southern Tyrol, reporting the capture
of several positions of strategic lia*
portance.
Defeat Not So lad.
The latest reports from the British
fleet, from neutral vessels which wit­
nessed part of the great natal bottlo
in the North Sea. and from survivors*
caused the English public to believe
that the engagement was not so much
of a defeat as at first reportfd and
in nowise a disaster. The looses in
all, accounted for, were: ,battlo

The German losses are believed
