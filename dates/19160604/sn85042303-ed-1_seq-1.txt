VICTIMS OF HICKORY CREEK
LAID TO REST AMID IMPRESS
IVE CEREMONIES STORES
CLOSE.
Friday was a day of genuine sorrow
and regret in this city when the re
mains of the three victims f the
Hock Crossing drowning were laid
to rest in Hose Hill cemetery, amid
impressive ceremonies.
The funeral of Miss Mansfield was
held at the family residence on I?
street, northwest, at 3:30 o'clock con
ducted by Hev. Dr. Cooper of the
Broadway Baptist church. The pall
bearers were selected from among
her young school friends.
The funeral services for Mr. Stub
blefield and his daughter were con
ducted at the Broadway Baptist
church by Hev. Dr. Cooper and was
one of the largest attended ever held
in the city. All stores closed for
the services and a majority of the
business men attended the services
both at the church and nt the grave.
The sad affair cast a gloom over
the city, and yesterday predictions
were made that a permanent ban
would be placed upon the blue hole in
Hickory creek, which has already
claimed many victims, besides giving
others narrow escapes.
ALL THE CANDIDATES WERE AT
NEWPORT DELIVERED THEIR
OPENING PLEA TO A LARGE
AUDIENCE.
They were off in a bunch at New
port last night, a,nd from now on it
will be no difficulty to pick out a
candidate from among the throng.
The opening speeches were made at
Newport school house last night un
der the usual circumstances, and
"Uncle Jim" Avery, master of cere
monies, acquitted himself in his usual
forceful manner.
On account of the number of can
didates to announce themselves, it
was necessary that their remarks be
confined to as few words as possible,
and "Uncle Jim" saw to it that this
rule was not violated. From now on
the race will be fast and furious, and
the boys "from the forks of the
creek" will have plenty of oratory
spilled in their vicinity In the stren
uous canvass for votes.
Thirty-five candidates have so far
announced for state and county of
fices but the chances are that sev
eral others will have their hats in
the ring before the date of filing.
