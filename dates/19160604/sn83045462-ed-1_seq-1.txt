CRANE PUT IN TIGHT PLACE
Supports Senator Weeks. But Faces
Bay State Sentiment for Roosevelt
or Hughes in Uninstructed
Delegation.
BY N. 0. MESSENGER.
CHlCAi iO. June 3.?1 lere is an
estimate of the situation tonight
from' the viewpoint of leading
men in the camps of the favorite
sons and allies:
That bars to the nomination
on an early ballot of either
Hughes or Roosevelt have been
constructed and promise to hold
t'>r a time. 1 his is satisfactory
to the allies fur the mothent. but
there is a weak spot in the defenses.
They think they have Roosevelt
boosters halted from one
direction. Hughes'advocates from
another, leaving an open pathway
for a candidate of their own
selection to the nomination. But
they have not agreed among
themselves upon that man.
Fear Dash for Nomination.
Meanwhile, pending conferences, corn-j
promises and negotiations, there is the
p ever-present danger that either Hughes
or Roosevelt may break through the
bars and make a dash for the nomination.
Kxplaining their confidence in having
held up the advance of Hughes and
Roosevelt sertiment, one of the allied
leaders said to The Star correspondent;
"We withstood the shock of the
Oregon and Vermont primaries; we
have held out for days against Roose- j
velt s brainstorm iri the west, and we I
have with us more than a majority of
the convention. We have not *be*n
shaken by either of these occurrences "
Now for the other side of the shield,
presenting the Roosevelt view of the
outlook, as Oeorge W Perkins, his
general manager, sees it:
"The progressives believe that the!
r mi a rs will have to r-ome to Ronse- I
v<:t We have a candidate .and are
united for him. They have no candidate
and are torn with jealousies Next
Monday we will seek a conference
with the regulars to try to bring about
harmony. We will ask the regulars
whom they offer as a substitute for
our proposed nominee. They will find
it impossible to agree upon one."
Perkins* View of Situation.
What Mr. Perkins is believed to be
count-rig upon is his conviction that
the old guard leaders and the managers
of the allies are now in a state of
* mind where if it came to the actual
test, they would prefer Col. Roosevelt,
, with his bar-king of big business and
k s adaptability to "practical politics,"
Mr. Justice Hughes, whose friendlikes.v
to the organization they question.

"there is a constantly rising tide of ir"jiration
against the proposed combina*.on
of Roosevelt, big business and
possibly some of the old guard standpar
leaders to name the candidate.
The operi entry of big business as
ba? ker of the Roosevelt candidacy ruts
both ways?it appeals to the practical
politicians but jars upon the sensibiliT;e-.
it is claimed, of a section of the
delegates who do not relish possible
complete domination of th?- party by
that element.
Ii Prominent eastern leaders, in conf

there is reason to believe they were

WATKRTOWN. X. V.. June 3.
?Secretary Lansing, before the
Jefferson County Bar Association
here tonight, scored critics
of the administration's foreign
policy who would have it do more
than has been done in the nego
uauuiiu arising iruni int.* war. anti
replied to those who complain the
United States has been more
vigorous in its dealings with Germany
"than with Great Britain.
"The violation of the natural
right of life is a much more serious
offense against an individual ,
and against his nation," Secretary
| Lansing said, "than the violation
of the legal right of property. Can
vou doubt for a moment which <
gives this government the great- .
est concern ?" i
Scorns Love of Ease. I
That there was an Influence in AmerI
ica. and even in Congress, which put '
right of property and right of life on
a par. Secretary Lansing declared,
showed that the "great heart of the j
republic is threatened with fatty de- 1
eenerarv through those who have lost '
their patriotic vigor; that many Amer- <
i icans have become lovers of ease !
rather than lovers of national honor. '
| Mr. Lansing read his address. He
I said he felt compelled to do so that he
< might not be misunderstood. The
principal part of his address follows:
"I have, for reasons which T will riot ,
state, but which must suggest themselves
to you. thus far avoided speechmaking
in these critical times. Our
foreign relations are too complex, too
uncertain, for me to exjjress publicly
my views, as I would sometimes like
to do, on the problems which this
KOvernniKiii na? iu i
haw- felt compelled. when I have
spoken, to commit my remarks to
writing in order that they might not 1
h'- misunderstood or misquoted. I,
therefore, offer no apology for reading
to you tonight instead of speaking, as
I would prefer to do.
War Creates New Conditions.
"The great war has caused so many
conditions which are entirely new and
presented so many questions which
were never before raised, or even
thought of, that it has been no easytask
to meet and answer them. The
relations between neutrals and belligerents
were never more difficult of
adjustment. ft was never harder to
I preserve neutral rights from invasion
) by the desperate opponents in the
titani' conflict in which the power, if
not the life, of the great empires of
the earth is at stake
"The peoples and government at war
are blinded by passion: their opinions
are unavoidably biased, their conduct
frequently influenced by hysterical Impulses,
which approach to madness. Patience
and forbearance are essential to a
neutral in dealing with such nations
Acts, which under normal conditions
would be most offensive, must be considered
calmly and without temper. In is
an extraordinary situation and requires
I extraordinary treatment, with a due !
j regard for the mental state of those
! who are straining every nerve to de1
f?at their enemies, and that end using
j every possible means to wfiken them
in their industrial as well us thejr military
power.
Great Britain and Germany.
J "In a nutshell, the situation of our
| relations with Great Britain and Germany,
the two powers with whieh we
have had our principal controversies,
Is this:
"Germany, having developed the submarine
as an offensive engine of destruction,
asserts that she cannot, on
account of the resulting conditions,
conform to the established rule.s of
naval warfare, and we should not,
therefore, insist on strict compliance.
Great Britain has no sympathy with
j the German point of view and demands
1 that the submarines observe the rules
! of visit and search without exception.
| "On the other hand. Great Britain de!
flares that, on account of the new con
ditions resulting from submarine aei
tivity and the use of mines and from
j the geological position of Germany,
' she cannot conform to the established
rules of blockade and contraband, and
j w anoum noi, inererore, hold her to
strict compliance with those rules.
Germany insists, nevertheless, that
Great Britain be made to follow the
existing law.

military necessity and offer the same
excuses for their illegal acts, but

HKI'RKSENTATIVK KITCHIN.
RALKfGH, N. C., June 3.?Complete
returns received tonight from the first
point reporting the result of the vote
in today's primary gave Attorney General
Bickett a majority of 500 over
Lieut. Gov. Paughtridge for the guhernatorial
nomination. Cnofticial figi
ures. however, from Kdgeeomb. Paughtridge's
home county, gave I>aughtridge
1,400 out of a total of 1,500 votes cast.
Indications were the contest would be
close.
No definite figures were available on
the result in the second congressional
district, where Claude Kitchin was opposed
for renomination by Olingman
W. Mitchell, but it was unofficially renorted
that Kitchin was renominated
by a large majority.
Rain and threatening weather, which
became general about noon, served to
keep voters from the polls, and the
vote was lighter than expected. Because
of the length and arrangement
of the ballot anything like definite figures
were not expected until late tonight.
State's First Legalized Primary.
The primary, which was the first
legalized primary ever held in the
state, virtually was a democratic primary,
as republicans only expressed
a preference for presidential and vice
presidential candidates .and voted for
members of the party seeking office in
several counties. The republicans previously
had ageed upon a state ticket
headed by Frank A. Linney for governor.
Names of presidential and vice presidential
candidates of neither party
were printed on the ballots, hut were
written in by the voters. Republican
sentiment generally was understood to
favor Col. Roosevelt.
President Wilson polled a heavy
democratic vote, while the vote for Vice
President was divided between Vice President
Marshall and Gov. Major of Missouri.
A full list of candidates for membership
in the national House of Representatives,
state offices, offices in more than
sixty counties and members of the legislature
were nominated.

Northern Railway Company.
The belief prevailed here that no will

of the trust in the same ratio that the
estate would be divided under the law.
