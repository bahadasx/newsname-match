LONDON, June 3. (11:05 p. in.)
The latest reports from the Brit
ish fleet, from neutral vessels which
witnessed parts of the great naval
battle in the North sea and from sur
vivors, cause the British public to
believe the encasement was not si
near a defeat as at first reported and
In no wise a disaster. The British
losses, with all the craft ensured ac
counted for. were three battle cruis
ers, three cruisers and eight dcslroy-

The German losses are believed to
have been about the same number
of ships, although a much less ag
gregate of tonnage.

British naval experts maintain that
fin at Britain continues to hold the
supreme command of the sea tv a
safe margin and that her enormou
navv could better afford the losses
it suffered than could the small C.er
man establishment. The first reports
of the heavy loss of life, unhappily,
have not been revised. (Ireat Britain
mourns for more than four thousand
of her hiwt scamci and the whole
nution Is oppressed with sadness.
There were some six thousand men
on th.i shins which sank and only it
few hundred have been saved. The
horrors of modern naval warfare, far
exceeding those when wooden ships
fought and continued to float even
when thev ceased to be fighting units.

It Is Impossible ti visualize any co

th.. battleship suuadron presumably
on his old flagship the T.lon, was
again In the thick of the action. Kvery

How far the Zeppelins contributed
to the German success is a matter of
dispute. Onlv one airship came with

Just before sentenco was passed
lnnes, through his counsel, asked

leniency. He asked consideration for
his wife, the mother o five children,
who was suffering from tuberculosis
and illness resulting from the recent

Indications Am That

A B. Wood, one of the Harris
contesting delegates from the
Fifth district, died in a local hos
pital this morning, a few hours
hcfi-re the national committee
voted to seat him.
Ilia place will be taken by
Amos F.wing. of Guthrie, unless
the report of the committee is
upset li v the national conven
tion. Wood lived at Mulhall.
CHICAGO. June 3. With tears in
his eyes Jim Harris plead with
the members of the Republic an com
mittee today not t.) unseat his fraud
ulently elected delegates from iho
Fifth and Sixth congressional districts
ef Oklahoma in order that he might
again force himself cpon the Repub
lican party of cikl.ihcma as the na
tional coinm ttccman from the state,
but was una! le to g'el them to do so.
He, however, by personal pleas and
deals did get the delegates sealed
from the Fifth district. although
every member of hc commiltt? who
expressed himself stMcd that it was a
raw deal. The McGraw delegates
from the Sixth district were seated
making an even split In the only two
contests from Oklahoma and guaran
tying the electing of McGraw as na
tional committeeman from Oklahoma.
Hart, the Idaho member of the com
mittee, served notice that he would
have a reconsideration of tho vote on
the Sixth district, but if this In done
It will likely result In the seating of
the delegates from the Fifth district.
Harris Can't Win.
If either coldest is taken up lefore
the committee on credentials both will
tie taken up and Harris Is certain to
low, as it was admitted that the only
thing that saed his face with the
committee was his membership on it
and personal work among the mem
bers, which will have no weight with
the convention. Th" Oklahoma dele
gation will meet Monday and organ
ize, the whole of the state will lie di
vided among the various candidates
for president, at least on the first bal
lots. Hughes In l irst.
Bet.ubllcan organization leaders ad
mitted tonight that Charles F. Hughes
would get more votes on the first bal
lot for the presidential nomination
than any of his competitors. They i
estimate his strength on the initial
ballot at between '. "i and 2 "5.
Tho oreaniation forces estimate
Roosevelt's first ballot strength at loss
than 150, but admit that his vote
will grow when the favorite son can
didates begin to drop out of the race.
This situation. It Is said, may lead
to a temporary combination of inter
os's between the organization and
friends of Boosevelt to fight Hughes
In the early hours of voting in tn.
convention.
What will happen after the first
few ballots arc taken nobody seem.
ablc to predict. There are outwaro
indications that the Boosevelt men
anil the organization Republican lead
ers are paving the way for possible
harmony later by numerous talks of
an informal character between repre
sentatives of each group. While no
definite understanding regarding a
program has been reached, both side
express the hope that some kind or
an agreement may be reached.
Tit for Tal.
The organization men arc said to
be counting on the assistance of the
Roosevelt delegates to defeat Hughes
and later to have the Hughes men ant
them in preventing Roosevelt from
obtaining the nomination. In this
way they believe they may succeed
in their plan to nominate one of tht.
favorite sons or a dark horse who will
be acceptable to the Progressives.
Following Is a statement of the
votes claimed by the managers of the
different candidates on the first bal
lot: Hughes 22. Weeks 200, Roosevelt
175, Burton 106. Fairbanks 9.1, Kooi
75, Sherman 65, Knox Mi, Brumbaugh
41, Ford .'10, I .a Follette 26. Genera.
Wood 1. Du Font 14, Borah S.
There was some talk today of a
plan to adopt the party platform be
fore nominating the candidate for
president in the convention, but this
suggestion brought a vigorous prntem
from the friends of Hughes, who pro
fessed to see In the movo a scheme
to injure the chances of their candi
date. Can't )cail I'cnroso.
One of the developments thai
aroused Interest duing the day was
a suggestion made by Alexander V.
Moore of Pennsylvania, a dulegate
and nn ardent Boosevelt supporter,
Mr. Moore said he thought It woulu
be a fine thing If Senator Penrose
of Pennsylvania could be induced to
support Colonel Roosevelt for the
presidential nomination asd then have
the Koosevelt element throw its
strength to the Pennsylvanian for the
chairmanship of the Republican na
tional committee for the purpose or
running the campaign. It would be
the best evidence, he said, of a r
united party.
Mr. Penrose said the Moore sugges
tion had been made to him, but he
did not care to have any one take it
seriously.
"I am not a candidate for chair
man," he said. "I prefer to give my
wt nle attention to mv diitiis In th
ICIl.lte."
Senator J. lines W. Wadsworth Oi
New oi k issued the following state
ment :
"Mr. Root's name will be presented
t the convention by a majority of the
New York convention. His candidacy
means no attack on any otln r candi
date or group. He is pre-eminently
the man to nominate.
"Mr. Boot, if nominated, will carry
New lurk by a big majority ami inai
means 4 I electoral votes.
"I l.i not think there is going to lie
any difficulty in the party getting to
gether on both the platform and t lie
candidate. There Is a very marked
spirit of conciliation apparent evcry-
here."
Wali'li Parade.
I Miring the day and evening the
political leaders found time between
conferences to pay some attention to
Chicago's great preparedness parade.
.Managers of all the avowed candidates
realized the significance of the great
demonstration and made it plain tti.it l
Ihcn respective candidates were with
the paraders in spiiit and with any
tuoM-ment that would adequately pre
pare the country for any eventuality.
George W. Perkins of New York
in a formal statement on the demon
stration said:
Itooscvclt tin American.
"The spirit of America Is being
aroused as it has not been aroused
since 1S6U. Far be it from me in any
way to try to make capital for Colonel
Roosevelt out of what I have seen,
but I cannot help saying that lie
typifies, if ever a man did. all that
these great parades mean. He Is the
leader. There can be no other real
leader. The people know this and
are calling for him."
It was estimated that about three
hundred delegates had arrived here
up to tonight. The great influx will
begin tomorrow. Numerous state
caucuses will be held Monday night
and Tuesday.
Theie was much activity about the
Indiana headquarters today. Sup
porters of the former vice-president
are making preparations for a big
demonstration in honor of Fairbanks
next week. Ten thousand persons
from Indiana, It was said, will come
here in special trains and much red
fire will be burned.
The rooms of Frank II. Hitchcock
were crowded with Hughes delegates
from different states throughout the
day. The Arizona delegation called on
Mr. Hitchcock and announced that
five of the delegates from that stale
would vote for Hughes and one for
Roosevelt.
Friends of former Congressman
Charles N. Fowler of New Jersey an
nounced today that he is a candidate
for the Republican presidential nom
ination and would open headquarters
ncre in a lew Hays.
Ffforts to bring abi-ut a settlement
of the Louisiana contests in which 12
delegates to the Republican national
convention are involved, failed today.
1 no Republican national committee
heurd evidence, but postponed taking
a vote in the hope tlint an amicable
ettlomont might he renched.
Throughout the day members of the
regular delegations and of tho cont.-st-ing
delegation, which claims to mer
it reci gnition because negroes were
barred from a New Orleans hotel in
which the state convention was held,
were closeted with conciliators. To
night representatives of the contest
ants declared thev had been offered
half of the delegation and other con
cessions, but had refused to accept the
propositi n. Thev demanded the
seating of their entire delegation.
Conti-st is Mooted.
This contest has given the national
committee more com cm than any
other.
When the committee adjourned at
5:311 o'clock tonight to meet at 9
o'clock Monday morning. It was un
derstood that the Louisiana disputi
would be one of 'he first taken up.
In the meantime members of the com
mittee will attempt to formulate a
plan on which both delegations can
agre.
In the past thro day's hearings
the national committee disposed of 34
deb-irate contests in seven states,
leaving 28 case. yet to be set
tled. The contests heard ami d' tor

Threatened fruit shortage in Oklaho

Last year was one of the heaviest fruit
