Some of the .big three Penrose.
Darnea and Crane were bombarded
with telegrams asking them to pre

been persistant rumors that Penrose,
while perhaps not ready to lend hit
active support to . Roosevelt, would
at leaat not fight against him.

today that the Rooaevek-Hughea sit

which would, furnish aa opportunity

which were sent to the bottom, Ger

today when it was learned that Jelli

the enemy1, that not ship of the first
powerful line was lost and that the.
Gorman dreadnaughts were forced to
return to their base.' i

down with their ships. ' Rear Adro1r-hlp'-were blown up Che loss ot life

It was officially stated at the ad

Whatever opinions to the contrary
that may be entertained by neutrals
are regarded as being due to the poor
handling of the first reports of the

While retreating the Germans sow
